AMERICA THAT VALUES CHILDREN 
AND FAMILIES AND THE FREEDOM TO 
BE WHO WE ARE?  
AND LET'S NOT FORGET OUR 
CITIZEN CHILDREN AND CITIZEN 
CHILDREN OF COLOR WHOSE LIVES 
ARE THREATENED EVERY DAY FOR 
REASONS BEYOND IMMIGRATION 
STATUS.  
AS ONE WHO HAS SEEN FIRSTHAND I 
HAVE TAUGHT MYSELF TO HAVE 
HOPE.  
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IS TO RISE 
ABOVE THE TYRANNY, THE 
IGNORANCE, THE MALPRACTICE AND 
BELIEVE IN CHANGE.  
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO COME 
TOGETHER ASSANATION AND RISE 
ABOVE DIVISION AND FEAR. 
ONLY THEN CAN WE STOP THE 
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES AND STOP 
THE POLICY THAT PLACES CHILDREN 
IN CAGES.  
SO FAR OUR FAMILIES AND 
CHILDREN, LET US MARCH AND LET 
OUR VOICES HEARD. 
REMEMBER -- REMEMBER, THIS IN 
NOVEMBER.  
NOVEMBER.  
REMEMBER THIS IN NOVEMBER WHEN 
WE MARCH TO THE POLLS AND 
REMEMBER OUR ANGER AND THE 
OUTRAGE AND DESIRE TO ACT. 
REMEMBER IN NOVEMBER THAT THE 
END TO THESE CRUEL POLICIES 
STARTS WITH US.  
MA MA, PAPA, I MISS YOU EVERY 
DAY. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PASSIONATE PROTESTS AND 
SPEECHES.  
THIS ONE WAS BY DIANE GUERRERO 
WHOSE PARENTS WERE DEPORTED.  
SHE IS THE ACTRESS FOR THE NEW 
ORANGE IN BLACK.  
I WANT TO BRING IN LINDA TREND 
A FOUNDING PARTNER OF NEW 
STRATEGIES.  
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 
SENSE OF THE MOVE AND DO YOU 
BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO 
SOMETHING MORE? 
>> THANKS, REENA.  
I AGREED TO BE WITH YOU.  
HOW I WOULD ENCAPSULATE THE 
DAY, THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR BUT 
A COMBINATION MESSAGE.  
ON THE ONE HAND A LOT OF ANGER 
AND A DISCUSSION OF ELECTORAL 
CONSEQUENCES AND VOTE IN 
NOVEMBER AND DUMP TRUMP AND 
THERE WAS A CLEAR MESSAGE OF 
LOVE AND HOPE AS WELL.  
YOU WOULD SEE SIGNED THAT SAID 
IMMIGRANTS WELCOME HERE.  
JUST HAVING FAMILIES, A FAMILY 
AFFAIR.  
THERE WERE BABIES AND SMALL 
CHILDREN.  
BRAVING THE HEAT TO SAY YOUR 
FAMILY IS JUST LIKE MINE AND WE 
WELCOME YOU HERE. 
>> I REMEMBER BEING SIDE BY 
SIDE WITH YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT 
AFTER THE INAUGURATION AT THE 
WOMEN'S MARCH IN CAPITOL HILL.  
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY RALLYING 
CRIES DURING THE 18 MONTHS THE 
PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION.  
DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT 
IMMIGRATION COULD LEAD TO 
LARGER MOVEMENT. 
IS THERE ENOUGH MOMENTUM AND 
COULD IT AFFECT MIDTERMS? 
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT REFORM 
MOVEMENT HAS EXISTED FOR QUITE 
A WHILE AND YOU SEE PEAKS AND 
VALLEYS DEPENDING ON WHO IS IN 
AUGUST AND IT IS DRIVEN FROM 
THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE.  
THIS WHOLE CRISIS AT THE 
BORDER, THE FAMILY SEPARATION 
ISSUE CLEARLY CONCERNS PEOPLE 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE IN A 
WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A 
LONG TIME. 
NOT SINCE DURING THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION TO BE HONEST.  
I THINK THERE IS A SENSE 
CERTAINLY AMONG PROGRESSIVE 
ACTIVISTS AND ALSO I WOULD SAY 
MODERATES THAT THERE IS AN 
OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR CONTINUED 
ORGANIZING -- CONTINUAL 
MOMENTUM FOR THE MIDTERM 
ELECTION. 
>> WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR 
LYNDA FOR THE COMING UP 
PROCEEDINGS, WE KNOW TYPICAL 
MIDTERMS IS A LESSER TURNOUT, 
WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS WATCHING? 
>> DEMOCRATS ARE REELING FROM 
THE SUPREME COURT CASES THAT 
CAME OUT LAST WEEK AND ALSO THE 
RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
JUSTICE KENNEDY.  
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT 
ACROSS THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT 
LARGE GROUPS AND SMALL GROUPS 
ARE RIGHT NOW STRATEGIZING 
ABOUT THE RIGHT APPROACH TO 
PUSH BACK.  
I THINK WHAT WE WILL END UP 
SEEING IS A LOT OF ON 
DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY LED BY 
WOMEN'S GROUPS ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ROW V WADE BEING 
OVERTURNED THE AFFORDABLE CARE 
ACT. 
>>> LYNDA TRAN.  
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
>>> THANK YOU. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUTTING 
A SEARCH FOR THE NEXT SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE ON THE FAST 
TRACK. 
HE WILL ANNOUNCE THE NOMINEE IN 
A WEEK ON MONDAY JULY 9th. 
THE PRESIDENT IS IN NEW JERSEY 
THIS WEEKEND BUT HE MAY START 
MEETING WITH CANDIDATES THERE 
AND HE SAYS IT IS DOWN TO A 
LIST OF FIVE INCLUDING TWO 
WOMEN. 
CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT BRETT 
CAVANAUGH AND AMY BARRETT ARE 
THE TWO POSSIBLE CANDIDATES.  
IT IS BECAUSE OF ANTHONY 
KENNEDY RETIREMENT.  
DURING AN INTERVIEW, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DISCUSSED HOW HE WOULD 
APPROACH THE TOPIC WITH HIS 
NOMINEE. 
>> ARE YOU GOING TO ASK YOUR 
NOMINEES BEFOREHAND HOW THEY 
MIGHT VOTES ON ROE VERSUS WADE. 
>> THAT IS A BIG ONE.  
PROBABLY NOT.  
YOU DON'T DO THAT.  
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT IS WHAT I 
HAVE BEEN TOLD BUT I AM PUTTING 
CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE ON AND I AM 
PROUD OF NEAL GORSCH.  
BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL BE 
SPECIFIC. 
>> WE HAVE NYL ES STANDIC. 
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT PICKS HOW 
DO YOU SEE THE CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS? 
>> CLEARLY WHOEVER THE 
PRESIDENT PICKS WILL BE 
STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  
THE PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS THEY 
DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THEIR 
OWN TO THWART THE NOMINATION.  
MITCH MCCONNELL, THE REPUBLICAN 
LEADER HAS SUGGESTED THAT HIS 
PARTY WILL PRESS ON PROMPTLY 
THAT THE CONFIRMATION COULD BE 
COMPLETED BY THE FALL.  
SO THAT'S THE GENERAL BACK DROP 
BUT THIS IS A BATTLAL ROYALE 
BETWEEN NOT JUST THE 
POLITICIANS BUT THE ACTIVIST. 
>>> HANGING OVER THE MUELLER 
PRBE, WE KNOW THERE IS ONE 
POTENTIAL NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUG H ARE THERE FACTORS 
THERE? 
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS A FACTOR 
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT IF HE 
GOT THE NOMINATION THAT WOULD 
BE SOMETHING THAT DEMOCRATS 
WOULD DRAW ATTENTION TO.  
AS WITH THE TRUMP ERA, WE ARE 
IN A UNIQUE SITUATION HERE, 
CLEARLY THE SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE COULD HAVE A ROLE TO 
PLAY IN A ADJUDICATING THINGS 
WHETHER INDICTMENTS CAN BE 
BROUGHT AGAINST A SITTING 
PRESIDENT AND THAT IS DEEP 
WATER POLITICALLY AND THAT IS 
WHERE WE ARE SAILING. 
>>> AND CHANGES AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, THERE IS TALK THAT 
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN 
KELLY MAY BE ON HIS WAY OUT. 
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD? 
>> MY REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT 
COULD BE QUITE IMMINENT, EVEN 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SO 
SKEPTICAL OR CRITICAL OF JOHN 
KELLY HAVE BEEN TELLING ME THAT 
THEY THINK THE END MAY BE NEAR 
FOR HIS TENURE.  
AND, OF COURSE, MR. KELLY 
HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT HE WAS 
BASICALLY PLANNING TO STAY A 
YEAR WHICH IS ALMOST UP. 
AND IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL 
SUCCESSORS, THE TWO NAMES WE 
HEAR ARE MICK MUL VAINY, THE 
BUDGET DIRECTOR AND NICK AYRES, 
CURRENTLY CHIEF OF STAFF. 
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 
OBAMA THAT WAS AT A FUNDRAISER 
IN BEVERLY HILLS.  
DO YOU THINK THAT HIS PRESENCE 
WILL HELP DEMOCRATS?  
IT DID NOT TRANSLATE DURING HIS 
PRESIDENTIAL YEARS. 
>> YEAH, YOU MAKE A FAIR POINT 
THAT A LOT BARACK OBAMA'S 
POPULARITY WAS PERSONAL AND HE 
COULDN'T PASS IT ON TO HIS 
PARTY IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS BUT 
HE IS A MAGNETIC FIGURE, EVEN 
HIS OPPONENTS AND CRITICS WOULD 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS A GIFTED 
ORATOR AND HAS THE CAPACITY TO 
INSPIRE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
AND THE DEMOCRATIC GRASSROOTS 
SO IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT I WOULD 
PREFER HAVING HIM ON MY SIDE 
THAN VARIOUS OTHER MEMBERS OF 
THE PARTY. 
>> AND TURNING TO NORTH KOREA, 
IT HAS BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE 
SUMMIT BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER.  
SINCE THEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
HE IS NO LONGER A NUCLEAR 
THREAT BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE 
THAT THERE IS INCREASING 
PRODUCTION AND HE SAYS THAT THE 
REMAINS OF U.S. SOLDIERS THAT 
WERE KILLED IN KOREA HAVE COME 
HOME.  
THIS IS A NOT TRUE.  
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
CURRENT STATUS OF THE 
NEGOTIATIONS, WHERE DO THEY 
STAND? 
>> THE KEY POINT HERE REALLY IS 
THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS CLAIMED ON WHAT 
APPEARS TO BE REALITY.  
HE WAS SUGGESTING THAT SUMMIT 
WITH KIM JONG-UN HAD SOLVED THE 
PROJECTS BUT THE SATELLITE 
IMAGES SHOWS THAT IS NOT THE 
CASE AND THEY COULD BE TRYING 
TO BOLTER THE NUCLEAR POWER.  
THAT'S A CLEAR PROBLEM AND I 
THINK THAT WILL CLEARLY HANG 
OVER IN FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND NORTH 
KOREA. 
>> DO YOU THINK WITH THE NEW 
SATELLITE IMAGES THAT SOMEHOW 
THE WHITE HOUSE MAY CHANGE 
THEIR TUNE ON THE APPROACH TO 
KIM JONG-UN? 
>> IT IS POSSIBLE.  
PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY CONSIDER 
THAT EVIDENCE THAT HE MAY HAVE 
BEEN MISLED. 
IT COULD HARDEN THE WHITE 
HOUSE'S ACTIONS POTENTIALLY BUT 
WE ALL KNOW THAT HOW THE WHITE 
HOUSE WILL REACT WITH NORTH 
KOREA IS NOT KNOWN. 
>> WE WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT 
WITH NORTH KOREA.  
BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS 
WEEKEND RALLIES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AGAINST PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S FAMILY, SEPARATION 
POLICY, DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT 
IMMIGRATION WILL HELP OR HURT 
HIM FOR MID TERMS AND HOW WILL 
IT AFFECT THE DEMOCRATS, IS IT 
A RALLY CRY TO GET PEOPLE TO 
GET OUT IN MID TERMS. 
>> IT COULD HELP ONE PARTY OR 
ANOTHER DEPENDING ON THE 
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE DISTRICT 
BUT THE ISSUE HOW THEY ARE 
PROTESTING DOES HURT THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY TO SOME 
EXTENT. 
THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE SEE 
SOMETIMES IN POLITICS REENA 
THAT HAS EMOTIONAL RESONANCE 
BEYOND A REGULAR NEWS STORY.  
I THINK THE VERY VISCERAL IDEA 
OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM 
THEIR PARENTS, DOES HIT HOME 
WITH PEOPLE.  
I THINK THAT REACHES FRANKLY 
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWING 
EVERY TWIST AND TURN IN 
WASHINGTON BUT HAVE AN 
UNDERSTANDABLE AVERSIO TO THAT 
KIND OF TREATMENT. 
>> DESPITE THE HOT WEATHER LOTS 
OF FOLKS GATHERING TO MAKE A 
STAND.  
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
>> THANKS, REENA. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE 
WILL BE RELEASING HIS 
NOMINATION FOR SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE ON JULY 9th.  
WHOEVER REPLACES JUSTICE 
KENNEDY WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF PRIOR IN IMPACTING 
THE NATION'S KEY ISSUES.  
JOINING US NOW FROM LOS ANGELES 
IS LOYOLA LAW PROFESSOR JESSICA 
LEV I N SON. 
>> THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE 
CANDIDATES.  
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEM? 
>> WELL, WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE 
BOTH FULLY VETTED CONSERVATIVE 
JUDGES AND THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN 
EFFECTIVE IN NOMINATING AND 
GETTING CONFIRMED VERY COVER 
SENSITIVE JUDGES ON THE LOWER 
COURT AND THE SUPREME COURT AND 
THE PRESIDENT HAS OUTSOURCED 
THE VETING TO TWO CONSERVATIVE 
ORGANIZATIONS THE FEDDALLIST 
AND HERITAGE ORGANIZATIONS.  
WE KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE 
DEPENDABLE. 
CONSERVATIVE JURISTS.  
THEY CLERK ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
ONE FOR KENNEDY AND ONE FOR 
SCAL I A AND THE MONTRA IS NOT 
JUST A SUITER THAT IS A 
REFERENCE TO JUSTICE SUITER 
NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT HERBERT 
BUSCH AND MOVED TO THE LEFT 
COMPARED TO WHAT REPUBLICANS 
WANTED.  
I THINK WE WILL SEE TWO 
PREDICTABLE JURISTS THAT WILL 
BE COMPARATIVELY FAR TO THE 
RIGHT OF JUSTICE KENNEDY. 
>> YOU SAY FAR TO THE RIGHT.  
IT WAS ACTUALLY -- KENNEDY WAS 
NOMINATED UNDER PRESIDENT 
RONALD REAGAN AT THE TIME.  
DO YOU GET A SENSE AND FEEL 
STRONGLY THAT THIS WILL AFFECT 
THE MAKEUP OF THE SUPREME 
COURT? 
>> I ABSOLUTELY DO.  
AND I THINK THAT IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER JUSTICE 
KENNEDY WAS NOBODY'S LIBERAL 
JURIST.  
HE WAS A CONSERVATIVE JURIST 
BUT MODERATE AND HE DID VOTE 
WITH THE CONSERVATIVE WING OF 
THE COURT BUT IN A FEW KEY 
ISSUES HE DIDN'T.  
AND THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT 
LIBERALS ARE WORRIED ABOUT.  
GAY RIGHTS, HE WAS THE ONE THAT 
AUTHORED THE OPINION THAT 
LEGALIZED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN 
THE AREA OF ABORTION IN THE 
AREA OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, IN 
SOME CRIMINAL JUSTICE AREAS.  
SO IN THE ONE HAND WE CAN SEE 
QUITE CLEARLY THAT HE WAS THE 
SWING VOTE IN THOSE HOT BUTTON 
ISSUES. 
ALSO I THINK WAYS KIND OF UNDER 
REPORTED THAT BEHIND THE SCENES 
JUSTICE KENNEDY HAD A 
MODERATING EFFECT.  
THERE WERE DECISIONS AND WE 
COULD LOOK TO THE LESS TWO 
WEEKS THAT WERE NARROWER OF 
WHAT WAS A MAJORITY OF THE 
POINT.  
WE COULD USE TO THE MASTERPIECE 
CAKE SHOP WITH THE COLORADO 
BAKER THAT DID NOT WANT TO BAKE 
A CAKE FOR A GAY COUPLE. 
IF YOU HAD A CONSERVATIVE 
MAJORITY OF THE COURT YOU MAY 
HAVE A BROADER DECISION THAT 
EMBRACES RELIGIOUS OBJECTORS 
BEING ABLE TO SAY TO GAY 
COUPLES I WILL NOT MAKE A CAKE 
FOR YOU AND THE SAME WITH 
GERRYMANDERING, IN BOTH CASES 
WE HAD NO DECISION IN LARGE 
PART BECAUSE OF JUSTICE 
KENNEDY. 
WHAT WE MIGHT SEE ARE BIGGER 
BOLDER DECISIONS. 
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
FRAMEWORK OF THE U.S. SUPREME 
COURT.  
WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN THEY SAY 
IT IS TILTED TOWARDS THE 
CONSERVATIVE SIDE? 
>> WELL I WOULD SAY A COUPLE OF 
THINGS, ONE THAT IS NOT THE 
CASE, WE HAVE TO TAKE A BROADER 
VIEW AND IT IS NOT ALWAYS 
TILTED TOWARDSTHE CONSERVATIVE 
TIME AND WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL 
ABOUT CONSERVATIVE VERSUS 
LIBERAL. 
>> IS THERE A DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN SAYING SOMEBODY IS 
CONSERVATIVE AS IN REPUBLICAN 
OR IS THERE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON 
IT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SORT OF 
A LEGAL TERM OF CONSERVATIVE? 
>> WELL THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. 
THERE SHOULD BE A DIFFERENCE 
BUT WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS 
SEEING NOW THAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE JUDGES ARE VOTING ACCORDING 
TO WHO NOMINATED THEM P IF A 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT NOMINATED 
THEM THEY ARE UPHOLDING THE 
CAUSES THAT REPUBLICANS CARE 
ABOUT.  
IF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT 
NOMINATED THEM THEN THEY ARE 
DOING THE OPPOSITE.  
BUT THERE IS AND SHOULD BE A 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONSERVATIVE 
LEGAL SCHOLAR AND CONSERVATIVE 
POLITICIAN.  
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE 
CURRENT CONSERVATIVE COURT IS 
FAR TO THE RIGHT OF PAST 
CONSERVATIVE COURTS SO I 
BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE THE 
MOST CONSERVATIVE COURT WE HAVE 
SEEN SINCE THE EARLY 1930S.  
YOU COULD HAVE A COURT THAT 
LEANS CONSERVATIVE BUT THIS 
COURT IS SO MUCH -- THE CENTER 
OF THE COURT IS FURTHER TO THE 
RIGHT OF ANYTHING THAT ANYONE 
IN THIS GENERATION HAS SEEN. 
>> SO THE SUPREME COURT WILL 
NOW BE NEXT IN SESSION COME 
OCTOBER AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
HE WANTS TO SEAT SOMEONE BY 
THEN.  
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CASES ARE 
THAT THEY COULD TAKE UP THAT 
COULD BE IMPACTED BY A MORE 
CONSERVATIVE COURT? 
>> WELL, I THINK THAT YOU KNOW 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AREAS OF 
VOTING RIGHTS, THIS IS A BIG 
AREA FOR THE COURT, IF YOU LOOK 
AT ISSUES RELATED TO OBVIOUSLY 
GUN CONTROL IS A BIG ISSUE, IF 
YOU LOOK AT RELIGIOUS RIGHTS, 
IF YOU LOOK AT ANTI 
DISCRIMINATION LAWS, IF YOU 
LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS, 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS, ALL 
OF THOSE THINGS ARE LIKELY TO 
BE DECIDED IN THE COMING TERMS. 
THEY HAVE GRANTED 
CERTIFICATIONS IN A NUMBER OF 
CASES AND DEALING WITH CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE.  
WE COULD SEE A DIFFERENT MAKEUP 
OF THE COURT AND DIFFERENT 
DECISIONS IF WE TALK NEXT YEAR 
AT THIS TIME. 
THESE ARE AREAS THAT AFFECT -- 
MOST OF US ARE AFFECTED BY ONE 
OF THESE AREAS AT LEAST ON A 
DAILY BASIS. 
>> AND CALLING FOR MORE 
DIVERSITY BY GENDER AND RACE. 
JESSICA THANK YOU FOR JOINING 
US. 
JESSICA LEVINSON. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> THIS SUNDAY ON FACE THE 
NATION, MODERATOR MARGARET 
BRENNAN WILL SITDOWN WITH JOHN 
BOLTEN THAT JUST GOT BACK FROM 
RUSSIA AND SHE WILL SIT WITH 
RICHARD BLOOMING THALIAN 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR OF PAT TOMBY

>>> THE ALLEGED SHOOTER FROM 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND WAS IN 
COURT.  
JARROD RAMOS WAS CHARGED WITH 
FIVE COUNTS OF FIRST-DEGREE 
MURDER AND WILL BE HELD WITHOUT 
BAIL.  
POLICE SAY THAT HE HAD A 
LONGSTANDING FEUD WITH THE 
PAPER.  
PAULA READ HAS THE LATEST FROM 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
>> POLICE SAY THE SUSPECT STILL 
REFUSES TO COOPERATE BUT A 
SEARCH OF HIS APARTMENT HAS 
REVEALED NEW DETAILS ABOUT 
EXACTLY HOW HE PLANNED THIS 
ATTACK.  
WE ARE ALSO GETTING NEW DETAILS 
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION FIVE 
YEARS AGO WHEN HE FIRST MADE 
THREATS AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER.  
VIDEO SHOWS THAT THE MOMENTS 
AFTER POLICE TOOK JARROD RAMOS 
INTO CUSTODY.  
THEY SAY THE 38-YEAR-OLD WAS 
HIDING UNDER A DESK IN THE 
NEWSROOM WHERE HE OPENED FIRE 
KILLING FIVE AND WOUNDING TWO 
MORE. 
>> THERE WERE TWO ENTRANCES IN 
THE OFFICES WHERE THE ATTACK 
OWE OCCURRED.  
THE RARE DOOR WAS BARRICADED, 
MR. RAMOS THEN AS I TOLD THE 
JUDGE ENTERED INTO THE FRONT 
DOOR AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH 
THE OFFICE WHERE HE WAS 
SHOOTING VICTIMS AS HE WALKED 
THROUGH THE OFFICE. 
>> ON FRIDAY RAMOS SAID NOTHING 
AS THE JUDGE ORDERED HIM TO BE 
HELD WITHOUT BOND.  
THURSDAY'S SHOOTING APPEARS TO 
BE THE END OF A LONG SIMMERING 
GRIG THAT RAMOS HELD AGAINST 
THE PAPER. 
ACCORDING TO COURT DOCUMENTS IN 
2012 RAMOS FILED AN 
UNSUCCESSFUL DEFAMATION LAWSUIT 
AGAINST THE PAPER AND A 
COLUMNIST THAT WROTE AN ARTICLE 
ABOUT ALLEGATIONS HE HARASED 
AND THREATENED A FORMER HIGH 
SCHOOL CLASSMATE. 
>> AS THE CASE MOVED THROUGH 
THE MARYLAND COURTS RAMOS WROTE 
ON TWITTER THAT HE WAS SUING 
HALF THE COUNTY AND MAKING 
CORPSES OF CORRUPT CAREERS AND 
CORPORATE ENTITIES.  
ANNE ARUNDEL POLICE DEPARTMENT 
INVESTIGATED THREATS. 
THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER NOTED 
IN THE POLICE REPORT THAT HE 
DID NOT BELIEVE RAMOS WAS A 
THREAT TO EMPLOYEES AT THE 
PAPER. 
ULTIMATELY THE PAPER DECIDED 
NOT TO PRESS CHARGES BECAUSE IT 
WOULD BE LIKE PUTTING A STICK 
IN A BEEHIVE.  
ATTORNEY BRENDON MCCARTHY 
REPRESENTED ANOTHER WOMAN THAT 
ACCUSED RAMOS OF STALKING HER.  
MCCARTHY TELLS CBS THE MOMENT 
HE HEARD ABOUT THE SHOOTING HE 
KNEW IT WAS RAMOS. 
>> IT WAS INEVITABLE. 
>> HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING 
VIOLENT.  
THE ONLY QUESTION WAS WHO WOULD 
HE GET FIRST. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CALLED 
JOURNALISTS THE ENEMY PEOPLE 
REMARK ON THE SHOOTING. 
>> JOURNALISTS LIKE ALL 
AMERICANS SHOULD BE FREE FROM 
THE FEAR OF BEING VIOLENTLY 
ATTACKED WHILE DOING THEIR JOB. 
>> WITHOUT JOURNALISM THERE IS 
NO HISTORY. 
>> ON FRIDAY HUNDREDS ATTENDED 
VIGILS ACROSS ANNAPOLIS TO 
REMEMBER THE VICTIMS.  
AMONG THEM WINTERS, THE DAWES 
OF THE SPECIAL PROJECTS EDITOR 
WENDI WINTERS. 
>> THIS IS FAR TOO SOON TO LOSE 
MY MOTHER THAT WAS A FANTASTIC 
WOMAN AND A GREAT MOTHER AND 
AMAZING REPORTER.  
AND SHE IS DOING HER JOB AND 
SHE WAS DOING WHAT SHE LOVED TO 
DO. 
>> THIS IS TODAY'S ADDITION OF 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE NEWSPAPER 
THAT CONTINUES TO PUBLISH 
DESPITE THE TRAGEDY AND WHILE 
YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE FIRST FEW 
PAGES ABOUT THE SHOOTING BUT 
THE REST OF THE NEWSPAPER 
COVERS EVERYTHING YOU WOULD 
EXPECT FROM A LOCAL NEWSPAPER 
ON A SATURDAY. 
THERE ARE STORIES ABOUT LOCAL 
SPORTS AND HOMES FOR SALE AND 
EVEN A STORY ABOUT A NEW PASTOR 
STARTING AT A LOCAL CHURCH. 
>> REENA. 
>> A REMINDER HOW IMPORTANT THE 
PAPERS ARE. 
>>> THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES PAID 
TRIB BIT TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 
ANNAPOLIS SHOOTING.  
THEY HELD A MOMENT OF SILENCE 
FOR THE FIVE VICTIMS BEFORE THE 
GAME AGAINST THE LOS ANGELES 
ANGELS.  
JOHN MCNAMARA WAS A SPORTS 
WRITER AND WORKED FOR THE PAPER 
AND DIED IN THE ATTACK. 
>>> NEW DETAILS ABOUT A STRING 
AN UNEXPLAINED SHOOTINGS IN 
CALIFORNIA.  
THEY HAPPENED AT THE CAMP SITE 
ALONG CALIFORNIA'S MALIBU 
COAST.  
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING A 
POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN 
LAST WEEK'S FATAL SHOOTING OF A 
FATHER AND A SEVERAL OTHER 
UNSOLVED SHOOTINGS.  
CARTER EVANS HAS MORE. 
>> AT THIS TIME WE ARE ASKED TO 
JUST ... 
>> THE INVESTIGATORS STILL 
AREN'T TALKING.  
A WEEK AFTER THE FATAL SHOOTING 
OF A FATHER CAMPING IN MALIBU 
STATE MARK DETECTIVES WERE BACK 
LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE.  
TRISTAN BODET WAS KILLED WHILE 
SLEEPING WITH HIS DAUGHTERS 
AGES TWO AND FOUR. 
SHOT IN THE HEAD.  
NO KNOWN MOTIVE, DETECTIVES 
SAID THERE WERE 7 OTHER 
SHOOTINGS. 
>> JAMES ROGERS WAS SHOT IN A 
CAMP SITE. 
>> I THINK THERE SHOULD BE AN 
OFFICER HERE. 
>> ROGERS DOES NOT FEEL SAFE 
AND HE BELIEVES THE SHOOTER MAY 
HAVE BEEN AIMING TO KILL HIM. 
>> I THINK THEY WERE AIMING FOR 
MY HEAD. 
>> OTHERS ARE SPEAKING OUT.  
THE OWNER OF THIS TESLA SAYS 
HIS CAR WAS SHOT DRIVING NEAR 
THE PARK AT AROUND 4 IN THE 
MORNING JUST FOUR DAYS BEFORE 
BODET WAS KILLED AND MELISSA 
HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE 
CAMPING IN HER SUV. 
THEY FEEL LIKE THE REPORTS 
WEREN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS NOT 
RESPONDED TO OUR REPEATED 
REQUEST FOR AN INTERVIEW BUT ON 
FRIDAY RELEASED A STATEMENT 
SAYING A LINK BETWEEN THE PAST 
SHOOTINGS AND THE MURDER WILL 
BE EXPLORED.  
THE PARK STRETCHES OVER MORE 
THAN 12 SQUARE MILES IN THE 
SANTA MONICA MS. AND WHILE THE 
CAMP GROUND IS CLOSED THE 
TRAILS ARE REMAINED OPENED. 
THERE ARE WARNINGS FROM 
RATTLESNAKE TO POISON OAK BUT 
NOTHING ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS AND 
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO MANY 
PARK VISITORS. 
>> THERE IS A FAMILY THAT JUST 
CAME BACK AND THEY DID NOT KNOW 
ABOUT THE KILLING AND HE COULD 
BE HERE BUT THERE'S NO WARNINGS 
OR ANYTHING.  
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FIND OUT ON 
YOUR OWN. 
>> THE CAMP GROUND IS CLOSED 
INDEFINITELY BUT THE REST OF 
THE PARK IS STILL OPEN AND 
BEYOND THE LACK OF WARNINGS 
THERE IS FRUSTRATION AMONG THE 
SHOOTING VICTIMS.  
THEY FEEL LIKE THE INITIAL 
REPORTS WERE NOT TAKEN 
SERIOUSLY. 
REENA.
>> CARTER EVANS, THANK YOU. 
>>> COMING UP AFTER A BREAK ON 
CBS, RECREATIONAL POT BECOMES 
LEGAL IN MASSACHUSETTS. 
>>> AND MORE ABOUT THE NEW

YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.  
CBSN NEWS ALWAYS ON.

FOR RETIRING SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY.  
HE WILL ANNOUNCE HIS CHOICE ON 
JULY 9th, AS THE CLOUD LOOMS 
COULD MAKING A SPECIAL PICK IS 
MADE COULD IT LEAD TO A CRISIS. 
DAVID JOINS US NOW TO DISCUSS 
IT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> BREAK DOWN YOUR ARGUMENT HOW 
COULD MAKING A SUPREME COURT 
PICK TURN INTO A CONSTITUTIONAL 
CRISIS. 
>> OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW 
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WILL 
TURN OUT AND WHAT IT WILL FIND. 
BUT IF IT FINDS THAT THERE WAS 
COLLUSION OR OUT RIGHT 
CONSPIRACY.  
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES US 
REMEDIES FOR WHAT YOU DO.  
YOU CAN VOTE OUT A PRESIDENT OR 
VOTE OUT LEGISLATURES.  
IT DOES NOT GIVE US REMEDIES 
FOR WHAT TO DO WITH JUSTICES 
APPOINTED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES 
THAT WE NOW KNOW WHICH IN THIS 
CASE WERE TOTALLY LEGITIMATE.  
WE WOULD HAVE TO AS A COUNTRY 
FIGURE IT OUT AND IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT AND THREATEN THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE JUDICIARY. 
>> THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE 
VOTING POWER AND WANT TO PUSH 
IT FORWARD.  
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING CHANGING IF 
THEY WANT TO GET SOMEONE IN 
THERE BEFORE MIDTERMS? 
>> I SUSPECT THAT MITCH 
MCCONNELL IS NOT WATCHING THIS 
INTERVIEW WAITING TO HEAR WHAT 
I THINK HE SHOULD DO.  
I THINK HE WILL GO AS FAST AS 
HE CAN.  
HE WILL RAM THIS THROUGH.  
DON'T FORGET NEAL GORSCH WAS 
RAMMED THROUGH.  
HOWEVER WE COULD SET OURSELVES 
UP FOR A SERIOUS CRISIS LIKE 20 
YEARS FROM NOW WE ARE SEEING 5-
4 EXTREM DECISIONS THAT WE 
KNOW WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE IF IT 
WAS NOT FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN 
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTIONS. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE THE PEOPLE 
WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT 
KIND OF REPEATED RESHAPING OF 
THE CONSTITUTION NOT JUST FOR A 
FEW YEARS BUT FOR DECADES 
KNOWING IT TO PLACE BECAUSE OF 
A HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER IF THAT 
IS WHAT WE FIND OUT. 
>> THE SUPREME COURT HAVE BEEN 
REVIEWED AS BIPARTISAN 
POLITICS. 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A 
POLITICAL PROCESS AND HOW DO 
YOU CHANGE IT, IF THIS IS THE 
CASE? 
>> THE SUPREME COURT HAS NEVER 
BEEN IMMUNE FROM POLITICS BUT 
BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
ALLIS IN CONGRESS FEEL LIKE 
THEY ARE PICKING A NEW TEAM 
MEMBER. 
JUSTICE ROBERTS TALKED ABOUT 
HIS ROLE AS UMPIRE CALLING 
BALLS AND STRIKES.  
MITCH MCCONNELL FEELS LIKE HE 
GOT A DRAFT PICK AND TRUMP FOR 
THE FIRST TIME I BELIEVE FOR A 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIDN'T 
JUST TALK ABOUT THE JUSTICE HE 
WOULD LIKE TO APPOINT, HE PUT 
OUT A LIST OF JUSTICES THAT HE 
MIGHT A POINT. 
THAT'S A NEW ENCROACHMENT OF 
THE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT. 
THESE ARE CHALLENGING THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE COURT LITTLE 
BY LITTLE AND THE RUSSIA PROBE 
OBVIOUSLY IF IT FINDS EVIDENCE 
OF SOMETHING MORE SEVERE THAN 
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN, IF THERE IS 
FIRE TO GO WITH THE SMOKE IT 
WILL MAKE THINGS WORSE. 
>> DAVID, WE ARE SEEING WE THE 
PEOPLE EARLIER AND SEEING FOLKS 
TAKEN TO THE STREETS IN CITIES 
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY OVER 
IMMIGRATION.  
HOW DOES WE THE PEOPLE, THE 
FOLKS OUT THERE IN AMERICA 
COUNTER A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 
WHEN YOU KNOW THESE ARE FOLKS 
THAT ARE NOMINATED FOR LIFE.  
HOW DOES ANYONE COUNTER THAT ON 
THE STREETS. 
>> I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN 
FOR GENERATIONS SUPREME COURTS 
THAT HAVE BEEN OUT OF STEP WITH 
WHAT THE PEOPLE, THE MAJORITY 
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT.  
THE LAST TIME WE HAD A MAJORITY 
OF THE COURT APPOINTED BY 
DEMOCRATS 1969, SO MOST 
AMERICANS HAVE NEVER BEEN ALIVE 
DURING A TIME WHEN THE COURT 
HAS NOT BEEN CONSENTTIVE.  
IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE, IF THE 
NEW 5-4 MAJORITY CAME TO BEING 
BECAUSE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN THE 
NEXT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION 
WILL PROBABLY BE THINKING ABOUT 
WAYS TO REFORM THE COURT AND 
MAKE SURE THAT PUTIN'S 
INFLUENCE IS NOT FELT FOR 
DECADES.  
ONE THING FOR WOE THE PEOPLE, 
THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS TO BE 
WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT 
WE GREW UP IN BUT THAT SYSTEM 
DOESN'TNEED TO INCLUDE FOREIGN 
POWERS GETTING TO PICK JUSTICES 
FOR LIFE. 
>>> DAVID LITT THANKS FOR 
JOINING US WITH YOUR 
PERSPECTIVE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> AROUND MICHAEL GRAHAM JOINS 
US, A CBS JOURNALIST.  
YOU HEARD IT THERE.  
A LOT OF IFS TO DAVID'S COLUMN, 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT IN. 
>> YOU HEAR THE PHRASE WE HAVE 
ONE PRESIDENT AT A TIME AND 
USUALLY THEY ARE REFERRING A 
TRANSITION POINT WHERE ONE IS 
GOING IN AND GOING OUT.  
MY COUNTER ARGUMENT IS THAT WE 
ARE ENTITLED TO AT LEAST ONE 
PRESIDENT AT A TIME.  
IF YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT 
CAN'T DO BASIC THINGS LIKE 
NOMINATE SOMEBODY FOR A SUPREME 
COURT VACANCY YOU DON'T HAVE A 
PRESIDENT AND THE IDEA TO SAY 
ONE DAY THIS PRESIDENT MIGHT BE 
IMPEACHED AND ONE DAY WE MIGHT 
DISCOVER THAT HE DID SOMETHING 
BAD AND SO HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING 
UNTIL THEN, I DON'T KNOW HOW 
THE SYSTEM WOULD WORK.  
THE GLARING OBVIOUS EXAMPLE IS 
RICHARD NIXON, HE WAS FORCED 
OUT OF OFFICE AND APPOINT TWO 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES.  
NOBODY SAID WE CAN'T HAVE 
JUSTICE RENQUIST ANYMORE.  
NIXON APPOINTED HIM. 
THE SYSTEM WORKS AND NOT 
PREDICATED ON EVERY INDIVIDUAL 
BEING PERFECT.  
THE PRESIDENT GETS TO NOMINATE 
SOMEBODY BECAUSE THE REASON WHY 
THE SENATE REVIEWS THEM, THE 
SENATE DOES NOT REVIEW A JUDGE 
GORSCH BASED ON DONALD TRUMP.  
DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS.  
IF THEY DO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF 
THEY ARE NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP OR PRESIDENT OBAMA OR 
SATAN.  
THE SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY GOOD 
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT DAVID 
IS OVERLOOKING. 
>> DO YOU HAVE FAITH IN THE 
SYSTEM?  
A LOT OF FOLKS LOOK AT THE 
SUPREME COURT HAS INSTITUTION 
THAT SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL 
BUT FOLKS BELIEVE THAT IT IS.  
HOW DO FOLKS AT HOME COUNTER 
THAT, MICHAEL. 
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.  
I THINK IT IS NAIVE TO THINK 
THE COURT IS BECOMING 
POLITICAL.  
IN FDR'S DAY THEY HAD OPINIONS 
OVER THE COURT IN ROE V WADE 
THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED AND 45 
YEARS LATER PEOPLE ARE DIVIDED 
AND YET THE COURT IS STILL THE 
COURT.  
THE NOTION THAT THE COURT IS 
SOMEHOW IN A DANGER -- 
INTERESTING POINT IN DAVID'S 
PIECE.  
WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOSING 
CREDIBILITY. 
GALLOP'S NUMBERS, DO YOU FEEL 
CONFIDENT IN THE INSTITUTION, 
TODAY ABOUT 40% OF AMERICANS 
FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE 
SUPREME COURT.  
TEN YEARS AGO THAT WAS DOWN TO 
32%. 
IT HAS GONE UP.  
THE SAME WITH THE PRESIDENCY. 
TODAY ABOUT 32% OF AMERICANS 
FEEL CONFIDENTS IN IT AND TEN 
YEARS AGO DOWN TO 25%. 
THE POINT IS THAT THE 
COMPETENCE IN THE INSTITUTIONS 
EBB AND FLOW DUE TO 
PARTISANSHIP.  
THERE'S NO REASON TO VACATE A 
PRESIDENTIAL'S CONSTITUTIONAL 
POWERS BECAUSE YOU THINK ONE 
DAY SOMEBODY MIGHT FIND OUT HE 
DID SOMETHING ICKY. 
>> SO YOU SEE WHOEVER THE 
PRESIDENT NOMINATES TO GO 
THROUGH BEFORE AS THE PRESIDENT 
WANTS BEFORE MIDTERMS? 
>> LOOK IT.  
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES SOMEONE 
IS LOUSY THE SENATE SHOULD 
REJECT THEM.  
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THE 
INVESTIGATION COMES OUT. 
GEORGE
W BUSH NOMINATED  NOMINATE 
HARRIET MYERS. 
AND SHE WAS A HORRIBLE PICK.  
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW 
RELEASING A LIST IS UNDERMINING 
IT.  
IT IS TRANSPARENT.  
YOU MAY NOT LIKE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S CHOICE BUT IT WILL BE 
SOMEONE THOROUGHLY VETTED BY 
THE SENATE AND THE PUBLIC AND 
THE MEDIA AND IF THAT PERSON IS 
QUALIFIED, NO MATTER WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE, NO 
MATTER WHAT DIFFERENCE IT WILL 
MAKE.  
IF YOU BUY THE NOTION THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT 
CHOICES SHOULD BE VACATED IF HE 
IS LATER CONVICTED OF 
COLLUSION, WHAT ABOUT THE 
EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HE 
SIGNED. 
WHAT ABOUT THE BILLS THAT HE 
SIGNED.  
I MEAN WE JUST CAN'T DO A 
PRESIDENCY THIS WAY WHERE IF IT 
IS RETROACTIVE, SORRY, WE 
DECIDED WE DON'T LIKE YOU SO WE 
WILL GET RID OF YOUR STUFF.  
OUR SYSTEM IS SPECIFICALLY 
DESIGNED TO BE BIGGER THAN ANY 
ONE PRESIDENT NO MATTER HOW HE 
OR SHE TURNS OUT TO BEHAVE. 
>>> MICHAEL, I WANT TO 
HIGHLIGHT, YOU GOT A NEW COLUMN 
ON MONDAY, YOU SUGGEST THAT 
OPENING MAY BE A BOOM TO 
DEMOCRATS IN MIDTERM.  
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS ONE? 
>> SO IT DEPENDS ON HOW THEY 
APPROACH IT, THE CHALLENGE THEY 
HAVE IS KEEPING THEIR TEAM 
ENERGIZED ABOUT DYING SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE COURT AND LET'S FACE 
IT AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT ON 
CBSN THEY NOT ONLY HAVE THE 
VOTES THE REPUBLICANS CAN DO 
WHAT THEY WANT BUT YOU WANT TO 
KEEP THEM ENERGIZED AND WITHOUT 
GOING TO CRAZY.  
I DON'T THINK THAT GIVING 
REPUBLICANS A CONSERVATIVE WILL 
INSPIRE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER AND 
YOU ARE MAKING THEM HAPPY.  
WHAT MOTIVATES VOTERS IS FEAR 
OR CONCERN AND SO IF 
REPUBLICANS ARE GETTING WHAT 
THEY WANT AND DEMOCRATS ARE 
MAKING THEIR CASE, THEN I THINK 
YOU KIND OF END UP WITH 
DIFFERENT SPLIT BUT IF 
DEMOCRATS DRIFT OVER TO OVERLY 
ZEALOUS. 
MORE INCIDENTS OF PEOPLE BEING 
THROWN OUT OF RESTAURANTS AND 
THE MARCHING TURNS FROM 
ANIMATED TO UGLY IT MAKES 
VOTERS NERVOUS. 
IF THESE CRAZIES GET IN POWER 
WE WILL SPEND TWO YEARS 
FIGHTING OFF CRAZINESS AND 
THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT DEMOCRATS 
ARE LOOKING FOR.  
ENERGIZED BUT NOT OVER THE TOP. 
>> WE KNOW MIDTERMS ARE HARD TO 
GET TURNOUTS.  
INTERESTING TO HEAR YOUR 
ARGUMENT THAT IT COULD MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY.  
MICHAEL GRAHAM, THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR TIME. 
>>> MY PLEASURE, THANK YOU. 
>>> COMING UP AFTER A BREAK. 
HOT OUT THERE FOR MUCH OF 
COUNTRY AND OFFICIALS ARE 
WARNING THAT IT COULD BE 
DANGERS. 
>> AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
FIGHTING MULTIPLE BATTLES FROM 
HIS GOLF RESORT IN NEW JERSEY 
AS THOUSANDS MARCH AGAINST HIS 
IMMIGRATION POLICY.  
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NARROWED 
DOWN HIS LIST FOR SUPREME COURT 
PICK.  
ERROL BARNETT HAS MORE. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP INTERVIEWING 
REPLACEMENTS FOR RETIRING 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTHONY 
KENNEDY. 
>> I LIKE THEM ALL. 
>> CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED THERE 
ARE TWO LEADING CONTENDERS 
BRETT KAVANAUGH FROM WASHINGTON 
AND 46 YEAR-OLD AMY BARRETT 
THAT THE PRESIDENT APPOINT TO 
THE 7th CIRCUIT IN CHICAGO.  
ALSO UP FOR CONSIDERATION IS A 
MOVE FOR A 49-YEAR-OLD IN 
CINCINNATI THAT WOULD BE THE 
FIRST INDIAN AMERICAN TO SERVE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
EXPRESSING EXCITEMENT ABOUT 
NOMINATING A SECOND SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE. 
>> I HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH 
JUDGES. 
>>> EARLIER MR. TRUMP 
HIGHLIGHTED HIS VISION TO 
RESHAPE THE HIGH COURT FOR 
DECADES. 
>> WE HAVE TO PICK ONE THAT 
WILL BE THERE FOR 45 YEARS. 
>> AND REMINDS HIS NOMINEES 
ONLY SURVIVE IF REPUBLICANS 
KEEP CONTROL OF THE SENATE. 
>> WE WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM 
JUSTICE KENNEDY'S SUCCESSOR. 
>> MITCH MCCONNELL WANTS TO 
MAKE USE OF HIS RAZOR IN THIS 
MAJORITY BECAUSE DEMOCRATS MAY 
WIN BACK CONTROL OF THE UPPER 
CHAMBER AFTER THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS.  
THE PRESIDENT HOSTED SIX 
SENATORS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
THURSDAY INCLUDING THREE 
VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS. 
>> THIS WEEK DEMOCRATIC EFFORTS 
TO PUSH OFF CONFIRMATION POINTS 
UNTIL NEXT YEAR.  
MERIT GARLAND HELD OFFICE FOR 
TEN MONTHS SIGHTING THE 
UPCOMING ELECTION BUT MITCH 
MCCONNELL REJECTED THAT. 
>> NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED THAT 
THE SENATE SHOULD PROCESS 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS IN 
ODD-NUMBERED YEARS. 
>> ADDING TO THE TENSION, BOTH 
SIDES KNOW THAT THIS PICK COULD 
CHANGE THE BALANCE OF THE COURT 
FOR A GENERATION. 
>> WHAT IS AT STAKE IS WHETHER 
OR NOT WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
RECOGNIZE OR NOT A WOMAN'S 
RIGHT TO CHOOSE. 
>> CBS NEWS ERROL BARNETT JOINS 
US FROM BERKELEY HEIGHTS NEW 
JERSEY.  
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE NEW 
INFORMATION FROM THE MAN WITH 
THE PRANK PHONE CALL CONCERNING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> OUR PRODUCER SARAH COOK GOT 
OFF OF THE PHONE WITH THE MAN 
BEHIND THIS FRANK PHONE CALL 
JOHN MELENDEZ THAT CONFIRMS 
THAT HE DID ON WEDNESDAY WITH 
HIS PODCAST MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO 
REACH OUT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE 
SWITCHBOARD AND AFTER A FEW 
FAILED ATTEMPTS CONNECTED WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOARD AIR 
FORCE ONE.  
MELENDEZ SAYING HE POSED AS 
SENATOR MELENDEZ OF NEW JERSEY 
AND THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR THE 
WHITE HOUSE TO PATCH THROUGH 
THIS COMEDIAN TO JARRED 
KUSHNER.  
THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISER AND SON-
IN-LAW.  
HE POISED AS THE SENATOR AND 
WANTED TO DISCUSS IMMIGRATION 
POLICY AND SURPRISED 20 MINUTES 
LATER HE GOT A PHONE CALL BACK 
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF 
AND THE PODCAST HAS POSTED THIS 
FOUR MINUTE CONVERSATION ONLINE 
AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
LISTENING TO IT AND MELENDEZ 
WAS SURPRISED AT HOW EASY IT 
WAS TO GET THROUGH TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND HOW HE SAYS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SEEMED TO BELIEVE THAT HE 
WAS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR 
FROM NEW JERSEY IN THE PHONE 
CALL.  
YOU CAN HEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CONGRATULATING WHO HE THOUGHT 
SENATOR MA  -- WAS THE SENATOR. 
IT SOUNDS CONVINCING.  
NOW THE SECRET SERVICE HAS 
VISITED HIS HOUSE AND HE DID 
NOT VISIT THE DOOR AND IN 
DISCUSSION WITH AN ATTORNEY 
THAT ALSO REPRESENTS STORMY 
DANIELS SHOULD THE WHITE HOUSE 
DECIDE TO PRESS CHARGES AND 
THIS COMEDIAN SAYS IT WAS HIM 
AND GOAT THROUGH THE PRESIDENT. 
>> I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS SAYING ABOUT THIS. 
>> THIS IS EXCEEDINGLY 
EMBARRASSING FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND THEY HAVE NOT 
COMMENTED. 
THEY TOLD US THEY WON'T ENGAGE 
ON THIS TOPIC BUT THEY ALSO NOT 
FORCEFULLY DENIED IT THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN WITH PREVIOUS 
INCIDENTS.  
WE DID GET CONFIRMATION FROM A 
PERSON FAMILIAR WITH 
CONVERSATIONS FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE ON THURSDAY AND DID REACH 
OUT TO SENATOR MENENDEZ'S 
OFFICE TO FLAG THIS PRANK PHONE 
CALL TO THE PRESIDENT TO THE 
OFFICE TO LET THEM KNOW SOMEONE 
WAS POSING AS THE SENATOR.  
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY EMBARRASSING 
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE IT 
EXPOSES JUST HOW EASY IT WAS 
FOR A CASUAL COMEDIAN WITH A 
PODCAST TO SPEAK TO THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
FOR FOUR MINUTES. 
>> IT IS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE 
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO TALK TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCORDING TO 
HIS ACCOUNT.  
I WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH A LOT 
OF VIBES ON SUPREME COURT COURT 
JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY 
ANNOUNCING THAT RETIREMENT ON 
WEDNESDAY.  
WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO RETIRE AT 
THIS SPECIFIC TIME.  
DO WE KNOW YET ERROL? 
>> A MAJOR DECISION, A MAJOR 
ANNOUNCEMENT AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS USING THIS WEEKEND TO 
TALK TO POTENTIALLY 
REPLACEMENTS.  
WE DON'T KNOW WHY JUSTICE 
KENNEDY ANNOUNCED HIS 
RETIREMENT NOW. 
USUALLY THEY DO IT WITH A 
RECESS AND IT WOULD FIT WITH 
THAT PRECEDENT AND HE HAS 
SERVED ALMOST TWICE AS LONG AS 
WHAT IS A TYPICAL TENURE OF 16 
YEARS AND JUSTICE KENNEDY BEING 
ON THE BENCH FOR THREE DECADES, 
81 YEARS OLD LIKE ANYONE ELSE 
THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED  AT THAT 
TIME HE LIKELY WANTS TO SPEND 
MORE TIME WITH HIS WIFE AND 
FAMILY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN SPEECHES HE 
MADE EARLIER THIS WEEK IN 
WISCONSIN CLAIMED THAT IT WAS 
HIS DISCUSSION WITH JUSTICE 
KENNEDY AND THE ASSURANCE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE HIM THAT 
HE WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A 
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE AND 
ULTIMATELY TIPPED JUSTICE 
KENNEDY TO MAKE THIS DECISION 
BUT IT IS A CONSEQUENTIAL ONE. 
>> IT IS AND WE KNOW THAT 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO WAIT TO AFTER 
MIDTERMS HOPING THE NUMBERS 
WOULD BE BETTER IN CONGRESS BUT 
WHAT IS THE SENSE.  
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT A 
POTENTIAL CONFIRMATION ABOUT 
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT 
NOMINATES? 
>> IT IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE 
JUSTICE KENNEDY HAS 
HISTORICALLY BEEN THE SWING 
VOTE WITH THE WINGS OF THE 
SUPREME COURT.  
HIS DECISIONS HAVE HELPED 
PROVIDE RIGHTS TO GAY AMERICANS 
AND HE HAS UPHELD ABORTION AS 
WELL. 
WITH HIS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
COMMITMENT TO REPLACE HIM WITH 
A CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE 
DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS ARE 
CONCERNED THAT THIS IS THE 
FIRST STEP TO ROE VERSUS WADE 
THAT LEGALIZE THE ABORTION TO 
BEING OVERTURNED. 
THEY TRIED TO PUSH SENATE 
LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL TO DELAY 
THIS VOTE UNTIL AFTER THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS ON THE SLIM 
CHANCE THAT PERHAPS DEMOCRATS 
WOULD HAVE ENOUGH SEATS TO GAIN 
THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH 
SEVERAL SENATORS THIS WEEK TO 
GAUGE WHAT WOULD BE PALATABLE 
FOR THEM. 
WHAT TYPE OF NOMINEE.  
THERE ARE TWO PRO ABORTION 
RIGHTS, REPUBLICAN SENATORS, 
LISA MCCOWSKY AND SUSAN OWENS 
OF MAINE HAVE YOU INDICATED 
THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE 
SOMEONE OVERTURN ROE VERSUS 
WADE. 
COLLINS SEES IT AS UNSETTLED 
LAW AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE 
WISE TO APPOINT A JUSTICE THAT 
IS NOT NEGATIVE IN ROE VERSUS 
WADE BUT THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE 
WOULD NOT ASK POTENTIAL 
NOMINEES SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 
THEIR VIEWS ON THIS ISSUE 
BECAUSE HE FELT IT WOULD BE 
INAPPROPRIATE BUT WE ARE 
STANDING BY TO SEE WHO HE WILL 
MEET IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AS A 
POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT FOR 
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 
>> TALK HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE 
SUPREME COURT THAT IT IS NOT 
DIVERSE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY ON 
ETHNIC LEVEL AND YOU ARE MAKING 
DECISIONS ON PEOPLE THAT COME 
FROM A WIDE RANGE OF 
BACKGROUNDS ANYTHING ON THAT? 
>> THERE IS ONE NOMINEE WHO IF 
CONFIRMED WOULD BE THE FIRST 
INDIAN AMERICAN TO SIT ON THE 
SUPREME COURT AND THAT IS AMAR 
PARAV AND CURRENTLY SERVES ON 
THE 6:00 CIRCUIT COURT OF 
APPEALS IN CINCINNATI AND THERE 
ARE TWO WOMEN ON HIS SHORT LIST 
OF POSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS AND 
THAT INCLUDES AMY BARRETT.  
SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD AND WAS 
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 
SIT ON THE 7th CIRCUIT COURT 
THERE IN CHICAGO.  
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE 
CLEAR IN HIS SPEECHES AND TO US 
YESTERDAY ON AIR FORCE ONE THAT 
HE WANTS TO NOMINATE SOMEONE 
THAT IS RELATIVELY YOUNG AS FAR 
AS JUDGES TO SIT AND RULE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT FOR 
GENERATIONS. 
SO WHOEVER HE CHOOSES HE WANTS 
IT TO BE SWIFT AND A LASTING 
LEGACY. 
ERROL BARNETT COMING TO US IN 
NEW JERSEY TRAVELING WITH THE

CARTER EVANS REPORTS FROM LOS 
ANGELES. 
>> I BELIEVE THAT I'M GOING TO 
A DIFFERENT SCHOOL THAN MY 
PEERS ARE.  
THEY HAVE HOUSES UP THE HILL 
AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED.  
THIS IS A NOT THE COLLEGE THAT 
I GO TO. 
>> WHY REYES MAY BLEND IN ON 
CAMPUS HE IS KEEPING A SECRET 
FROM HIS CLASSMATES.  
HE IS HOMELESS.  
HIS SCHOOL LOCKER IS HIS 
CLOSET.  
HE BRUSHES HIS TEETH IN A

SLEEPS ON THIS SOFA INSIDE A 24-
HOUR CAMPUS LIBRARY. 
>> MY FIRST QUARTER HERE 
ACTUALLY LIVED INSIDE OF MY 
CAR. 
THAT'S WHERE I HAD MY CLOTHES 
AND EVERYTHING I NEEDED FOR 
THE. 
>> BUT AFTER THE CAR WAS 
TOTALED IN AN ACCIDENT, A 
HOMELESS SHELTER A FEW MILES 
AWAY FROM CAMPUS WAS HIS ONLY 
OPTION. 
ACCORDING TO THE U.S.

WERE 32,000 HOMELESS COLLEGE 
STUDENTS IN 2017.  
REYES IS HOPING TO ATTEND

>> I WANT TO BE AN ORTHOPEDIC

>> HIS TUITION IS $13,000 WHICH 
IS COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID, 
STUDENT LOANS AND A JOB ON 
CAMPUS.  
BUT AFTER BOOKS AND FOOD THERE 
IS NOTHING LEFT FOR RENT. 
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS 
CAMPUS, THE BEAUTY AND THE 
PRESTIGE OF BEING HERE, IT IS 
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT SOME OF 
THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A HOME 
TO GO TO. 
>> IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE 
OBVIOUSLY IT DOES EXIST.  
IT IS JUST DIFFICULT TO GRASP 
AND PUT INTO A QUANTATATIVE 
FORM. 
>> AND NOT JUST A HOUSING 
PROBLEM.  
A SURVEY OF STUDENTS AT TEN

>>>PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUTTING 
HIS SEARCH 
FOR THE NEXT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE ON THE FAST 
TRACK.  
HE SAYS HE'LL ANNOUNCE HIS 
NOMINEE ON 
JULY 9TH.  
HE SAYS IT'S DOWN TO A LIST OF 
FIVE, 
INCLUDING TWO WOMEN.  
NEWS CBS HAS LEARNED THAT 
TWO OF THE TOP CANDIDATES ARE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
A U.S. CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE FROM 
WASHINGTON 
D.C., AND AMY BARRETT WHO THE 
PRESIDENT 
APPOINTED TO THE COURT IN 
CHICAGO.  
ADVOCACY 
GROUPS ARE TREATING THE VACANCY 
AS A CRITICAL 
MOMENT FOR ABORTION RIGHTS.  
PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DISCUSSED HOW HE WOULD APPROACH 
THAT TOPIC WITH 
HIS NOMINEE. 
>> ARE YOU GOING TO ASK YOUR 
NOMINEES 
BEFOREHAND HOW THEY MIGHT VOTE 
ON ROE VERSUS 
WADE. 
>> THAT'S A BIG ONE.  
THEY'RE ALL SAYING 
YOU DON'T DO THAT, YOU 
SHOULDN'T DO THAT, BUT 
I'M PUTTING CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE 
ON.  
I'M VERY 
PROUD OF NEIL GORSUCH.  
HIS OPINIONS ARE SO 
WELL WRITTEN, SABRIL QUANTITY, 
AND I'M GOING TO 
-- SO BRILLIANT, AND I'M GOING 
TO TRY TO DO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
>> FOR MORE, WE HAVE NILES 
JOINING US FROM 
WASHINGTON.  
NILE, WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
TALK 
ABOUT ROE V. WADE.  
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT 
PICKS, HOW DO YOU SEE THE 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS 
PLAYING OUT FROM A POLITICAL 
PERSPECTIVE? 
>> CLEARLY WHOEVER THE 
PRESIDENT PICKS 
WILL BE STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE 
DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY.  
THE PROBLEM WITH THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY 
IS THEY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS 
THORACIC OUTLET 
THWART THIS NOMINATION.  
MITCH MCCONNELL HAS 
SUGGESTED THAT HIS PARTY WILL 
PRESS ON 
PROMPTLY, THAT THE CONFIRMATION 
COULD BE 
COMPLETED BY THE FALL.  
THAT'S THE GENERAL 
BACKDROP BUT CLEARLY THIS IS 
GOING TO BE A 
BATTLE ROYALE BETWEEN NOT JUST 
THE POLITICIANS 
IN EACH PARTY BUT THE ACTIVISTS 
IN EACH CAMP AS 
WELL. 
>> ANOTHER ISSUE FOR IS THIS 
FIGHT IS 
OBVIOUSLY HANGING OVER THE 
MUELLER PROBE.  
WE 
KNOW THERE'S AT LEAST ONE 
POTENTIAL NOMINEE, 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WHO'S WRITTEN 
THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE 
INCUMBERED BY 
INVESTIGATIONS OF ANY KIND.  
DO YOU GET A SENSE 
THAT'S EVEN A FACTOR IN THIS? 
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A FACTOR 
FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT IF MR. 
KAVANAUGH DID GET 
THE NOMINATION, I THINK THAT 
WOULD CLEARLY BE 
SOMETHING DEMOCRATS WOULD DRAW 
ATTENTION TO.  
AS WITH SO MANY THINGS DURING 
THE TRUMP ERA, 
WE'RE IN A UNIQUE SITUATION 
HERE.  
CLEARLY THIS 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE COULD 
HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY 
IN  ADJUDICATING WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT HAS THE 
POWER TO PARDON HIMSELF AND 
THAT IS DEEP WATER 
LEGALLY AND POLITICALLY BUT 
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE 
SAILING. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
CHANGES 
POTENTIALLY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THERE'S BEEN 
TALK THAT JOHN KELLY MAY BE ON 
HIS WAY OUT.  
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT? 
>> MY REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT 
THAT COULD 
BE QUITE IMMINENT.  
EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT 
BEEN SKEPTICAL OF JOHN KELLY 
HAVE BEEN SAYING 
THE END MAY BE NEAR.  
MR. KELLY HIMSELF SAID HE 
WAS BASICALLY PLANNING TO STAY 
A YEAR WHICH IS 
ALMOST UP.  
IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL 
SUCCESSORS, 
WE HEAR MULVANEY AND NICK AIRS. 
>> WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 
BARACK OBAMA.  
HE WAS IN FACT ADDRESSING A 
CROWD IN D.C., A 
FUNDRAISING EVENT FOR THE DNC.  
DO YOU THINK 
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PRESENCE 
WILL HELP 
DEMOCRATS?  
IT DIDN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE 
DURING 
HIS PRESIDENTIAL YEARS? 
>> YOU MAKE A FAIR POINT WHICH 
IS THAT A 
LOT OF BARACK OBAMA'S 
POPULARITY WAS PERSONAL.  
HE IS A VERY MAGNETIC FIGURE.  
I THINK 
OPPONENTS AND CRITICS WOULD SAY 
HE'S A GIFTED 
ORATOR.  
IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT, I WOULD 
MUCH 
PREFER HAVING HIM ON MY SIDE 
THAN VARIOUS OTHER 
LEADING MEMBERS OF THE PARTY. 
>> I WANT TO TURN TO NORTH 
KOREA FOR A 
SECOND.  
ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THAT 
SUMMIT 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER.  
SINCE THEN, THE PRESIDENT SAID 
THAT 
NORTH KOREA IS NO LONGER A 
NUCLEAR THREAT BUT 
WE KNOW THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT 
THERE'S 
INCREASING PRODUCTION.  
HE SAID THE REMAINS OF 
SOLDIERS KILLED IN NORTH KOREA 
HAVE COME HOME, 
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.  
WHERE DO WE STAND IN 
THE NEGOTIATIONS? 
>> THINK THE KEY THING IS THE 
GAP BETWEEN 
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 
CLAIMED AND REALITY.  
HE WAS SUGGESTING THAT THAT 
SUMMIT WITH KIM 
JONG UN HAD SOLVED THE NUCLEAR 
PROBLEM.  
THESE 
SALT LITE IMAGES THAT WE'RE -- 
SATELLITE IMAGES 
THAT WE'RE GETTING PROVE THAT 
IS NOT THE CASE, 
IN FACT THE REGIME COULD BE 
TRYING TO BOLSTER 
ITS NUCLEAR PROBLEM.  
THAT'S A CLEAR PROBLEM, 
AND I THINK THAT WILL HANG OVER 
ANY FURTHER 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
>> DO YOU THINK WITH THOSE 
SATELLITE 
IMAGES THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
MIGHT CHANGE THEIR 
APPROACH TOWARD KIM JONG UN? 
>> IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.  
PRESIDENT 
TRUMP COULD CONSIDER THAT A 
BETRAYAL OF TRUST 
OR A MISLEAD, EVIDENCE THAT HE 
HAD BEEN MISLED 
IN HIS INITIAL TALKS.  
IT COULD HARDEN THE 
WHITE HOUSE'S LINE POTENTIALLY, 
BUT AS WE ALL 
KNOW, PREDICTING HOW THIS WHITE 
HOUSE WILL 
REACT, SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION 
TO NORTH KOREA, 
HAS PROVEN A FOOL'S ERRAND IN 
THE PAST. 
>> WE WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT 
WITH NORTH 
KOREA.  
I WANT TO ASK YOU, THIS 
WEEKEND, 
RALLIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
AGAINST PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S FAMILY SEPARATION 
POLICY.  
DO YOU GET A 
SENSE THAT IMMIGRATION IS GOING 
TO HELP OR HURT 
HIM GOING INTO MIDTERMS AND HOW 
WILL IT HELP 
THE DEMOCRATS? 
>> IMMIGRATION AT LARGE, I 
THINK, CAN HELP 
ONE PARTY OR ANOTHER, DEPENDING 
ON THE 
DEMOGRAPHICS OF DISTRICTS. 
THE ISSUE ABOUT 
WHICH PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING, I 
THINK THAT DOES 
HURT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO 
SOME EXTENT.  
THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE SEE 
IN POLITICS 
THAT HAS AN EMOTIONAL RESONANCE 
BEYOND A NEWS 
STORY.  
I THINK THE VISCERAL IDEA OF 
SEPARATING 
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS 
DOES HIT HOME WITH 
PEOPLE.  
I THINK THAT HITS PEOPLE WHO 
ARE NOT 
FOLLOWING EVERY TWIST AND TURN 
IN WASHINGTON 
BUT HAVE AN UNDERSTANDABLE 
AVERSION TO THAT 
TREATMENT. 
>> AND DESPITE THE HOT WEATHER, 
LOTS OF 
FOLKS OUT MAKING A STAND.  
NILE, THANKS FOR 
JOINING US. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> THIS SUNDAY ON FACE THE 
NATION, 
MARGARET BRENNAN WILL TALK TO 
DEMOCRATIC 
SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT, 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR 
FROM PENNSYLVANIA, AND FORMER 
U.S. AMBASSADOR 
TO MEXICO.  
ALSO JOINING THE SHOW, MARK 
SALTER.  
YOU CAN STREAM FACE THE NATION 
ON SUNDAY.

>>>THE ALLEGED SHOOTER IN THE 
ATTACK ON 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE NEWSPAPER 
IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND WAS IN COURT FRIDAY.  
JARROD RAMOS WAS 
CHARGED WITH FIVE COUNTS OF 
FIRST DEGREE MURDER 
AND WILL BE HELD WITHOUT BAIL.  
POLICE SAY HE 
HAD A LONG STANDING FEUD WITH 
THE PAPER. 
Reporter:  POLICE SAY THE 
SUSPECT STILL 
REFUSES TO COOPERATE BUT A 
SEARCH OF HIS 
APARTMENT HAS REVEALED CAN  -- 
DETAILS ABOUT HOW HE 
PLANNED THIS ATTACK.  
WE'RE ALSO GETTING 
INFORMATION ABOUT FIVE YEARS 
AGO WHEN HE FIRST 
MADE THREATS AGAINST THE 
NEWSPAPER. 
>> VIDEO SHOWS THE MOMENTS 
POLICE TOOK 
JARROD RAMOS INTO CUSTODY.  
THEY SAY HE WAS 
HIDING UNDER A DESK IN THE NEWS 
ROOM WHERE HE 
ALLEGEDLY OPENED FIRE ON 
NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES 
KILLING FIVE AND WOUNDING TWO 
MORE. 
>> THERE WERE TWO ENTRANCES TO 
THE OFFICES 
IN WHICH THIS ATTACK OCCURRED.  
THE REAR DOOR 
WAS BARRICADED.  
MR. RAMOS, THEN, AS I TOLD THE 
JUDGE, ENTERED THE FRONT DOOR 
AND WORKED HIS 
WAY THROUGH THE OFFICE WHERE HE 
WAS SHOOTING 
VICTIMS AS HE WALKED THROUGH 
THE OFFICE. 
Reporter:  ON FRIDAY, RAMOS 
SAID NOTHING 
AS A JUDGE ORDERED HIM TO BE 
HELD WITHOUT BOND.  
THURSDAY'S SHOOTING APPEARS TO 
BE THE END OF A 
LONG SIMMERING GRUDGE RAMOS 
HELD AGAINST THE 
PAPER.  
ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS, IN 
2012, RAMOS 
FILED AN UNSUCCESSFUL 
DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST 
THE PAPER AFTER AN ARTICLE RAN 
ABOUT HIM AND 
HIS HARASSMENT OF A FORMER 
CLASSMATE.  
HE WROTE 
THAT HE WAS SUING HALF THE 
COUNTY.  
IN 2013, 
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
