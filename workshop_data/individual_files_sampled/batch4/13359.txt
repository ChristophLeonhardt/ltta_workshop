there was an ongoing investigation involving the memos why should they be given to Congress well yesterday they said fine we'll hand him over to Congress okay and then within five minutes of them being handed over to Congress The Associated Press have that had them The Washington Post had them everybody in the press had them why do these memos matter why do these memos matter well there are a few reasons these memos matter so on the Left they're suggesting these memos matter because James Comey now looks more consistent it looks like he's been consistent to his story throughout okay fair enough but there are some problems for James Comey in the memos hey first problem for Jim's coming in the memos first of all the memos themselves have some redactions that means that some of the material in the memos is still classified well that raises a question was James Comey leaking classified material from his memos to the press if so that's actually a crime now Comey says he only leaked one memo to his friend and that memo was unclassified but we're gonna have to figure this thing out because the fact is that according to the letter from the DOJ to Congress releasing these memos quote pursuant to your request we are providing the requested memoranda in both redacted and unredacted formats for your convenience the unredacted documents are classified and will provide those in a separate secure transmittal to the House Security office tomorrow which seems to imply that commis memos were not all unclassified okay also this seems to suggest that the DOJ fibbed about the importance of the memos in the first place as I mentioned the DOJ refused to turn over the memos when requested under the Freedom of Information Act last year they claimed that the release of the memos would somehow impede the Muller investigation nothing in the memo seems to suggest this is true The Meadows also do not suggest obstruction so this is a point in favor of President Trump after the release of the memos representatives Devin Nunez Bob Goodlatte trey Gowdy they tore into Comey they said quote the memos show that the president made clear he wanted allegations of collusion coordination and conspiracy between his campaign and Russia fully investigated furthermore the memos demonstrate the term didn't want Russian and election interference investigation ended but the suggestion that he had engaged in lewd personal conduct he wanted investigated so he was much more concerned with the allegations about the P tape then he was concerned about the idea that Russia interfered in the election he wasn't seeking to shut anything down or or direct the investigation in any particular direction except on the P tape according to the Comey memos as the congressman point out the memos also show a former director Comey never wrote that he felt instructed or threat which is of course true he didn't feel obstructed or threatened until he was fired at which point it became sour grapes maybe I was fired because of obstruction as opposed to I was fired because I'm wildly incompetent at my job it is also true that these memos show that James Comey held the Trump administration and President Trump to a different standard than he held members of the Obama administration so Comey has stated he interfered in the Hillary Clinton email investigation in an unprecedented way right he went out there he did his big press conference where he announced basically why Hillary Clinton should be indicted and then said she shouldn't be indicted he did that an attempt to shield Loretta Lynch the Attorney General from allegations of bias or corruption well he never wrote contemporaneous memos about his meetings with Loretta Lynch or Barack Obama during that time even though he was so worried about it that he interfered in the middle of an investigation in a way that is wildly unprecedented he only reserved those memos for Trump and this is what the congressmen point out they say quote he chose not to memorialize conversations with President Obama attorney general Lynch Secretary Clinton Andrew McCabe or others but he immediately began to memorialize conversations with President Trump these memos also lay bare the notion that director form of former director Comey is not motivated by animus Comey also never bothered to try to launch a special counsel investigation against Lynch and Clinton through leaks also worth noting in these memos Comey defended McCabe repeatedly and personally to President Trump now turns out that McCabe was in fact lying repeatedly and now is under criminal investigation that came out yesterday that Andrew McCain has been now referred by the IG for criminal investigation on the basis of leaking to the press a bunch of stories about his involvement in the Hillary Clinton Foundation scandal and and his attempts to investigate it
