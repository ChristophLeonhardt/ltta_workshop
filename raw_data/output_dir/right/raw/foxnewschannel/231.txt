BLATHERRING IGNORANCE, AS A MAN

ADMIRES HIS GENIUS, AND

67
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,297
CONSIDERS HIM A FRIEND.

68
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,033
>> THIS IS THE KIND OF

69
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,335
CONVERSATION THAT WOULD

WEARING A RED HAT.

78
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,450

POSTING, THIS IS THE MOST

90
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:53,072
REPULSIVE, DISGRACE WHY, ACT OF

00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,774
DESPERATION AND AUCTIONING-OFF

92
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,609
OF ONE'S SOUL TO GAIN POWER I'VE

93
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,410
EVER SEEN.

94
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,880
OTHER HOLLYWOOD STARS, CHELSEA

00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,781
HANDLER, ROSIE O'DONNELL

96
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,016
SLAMMING IT.

97
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:03,683
BUT WE WANT TO GET TO THE

98
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,619
DISCUSSION.

99
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,254
JESSE, HYSTERIA, OVER THIS

100
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,255
MEETING, WAS HOT AND HEAVY.

101
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,959
>> Jesse: RIGHT.

102
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,595
SO, IF KANYE IS SO MARGINALIZED

103
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,530
AND SO INSIGNIFICANT AND SUCH A

104
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,799
CLOWNIES THE MEDIA SO ANGRY?

105
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,534
WHY ARE THEY SO UPSET?

106
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,735
HE'S INFLUENTIAL, BECAUSE HE'S

107
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,870
MAKING A LOT OF MONEY, HE'S VERY

108
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,371
TALENTED.

109
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,273
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTEN TO

110
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,842
HIM, HE'S POPULAR.

111
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,578
IF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS

112
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,280
OPEN-MINDED ABOUT PRESIDENT

113
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,916
TRUMP, THEN THAT POSES A

114
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:37,684
SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO DEMOCRATS

115
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:38,451
ELECTORALLY.

116
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,852
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE WRITTEN OFF

117
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,587
THE WHITE WORKING CLASS, WRITTEN

118
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,491
OFF VETERANS, THEY HAVE WRITTEN

119
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,493
OFF A KEY CONSTITUENCY WITHIN

120
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,961
THE PAR THINK.

121
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,463
EF -- PARTY.

122
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,232
THEY HAVE TO DRIVE UP NUMBERS

123
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,801
WITH MINORITIES TO SAY THERE

124
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,402
WITH DONALD TRUMP IN 2020.

125
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,105
THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR THEM.

126
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,973
YOU REMEMBER WHEN KANYE WEST

127
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:01,808
SAID GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T CARE

128
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,277
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.

129
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,413
THE SAME MEDIA THAT IS

130
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,715
CRITICIZING HIM NOW APPLAUDED

131
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,248
HIM THEN.

132
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,117
WHEN YOU CRITICIZE, A BLACK MAN,

133
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,419
A REPUBLICAN YOU'RE SANE.

134
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,955
AND THEN WHEN YOU SPREAD LOVE TO

135
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,857
A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT YOU'RE

136
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,191
INSANE?

137
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,726
I DON'T LIKE HOW THAT WORKS.

138
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,559
DONALD TRUMP WON ABOUT 8% OF THE

139
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,827
BLACK VOTE.

140
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,230
DOES THAT MEAN ALL THOSE 8% OF

141
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,732
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THIS

142
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:26,833
COUNTRY ARE CRAZY?

143
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,534
THEY'RE IG NOMPBT?

144
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,037
THEY'RE ALL FOOLS?

145
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:31,571
IGNORANT?

146
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:37,210
WOMEN WHO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP

147
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,748
ARE THEY GENDER TRAITORS?

148
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,115
HISPANICS?

149
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,916
WHEN THE MEDIA SAYS THAT VOTING

150
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,252
AS A BLACK MAN FOR DONALD TRUMP

151
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,454
IS AGAINST YOURSELF INTERESTS,

152
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,756
WHO ARE THEY TO DETERMINE WHO IS

153
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,424
SOME ONE'S SELF INTEREST.

154
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,692
WHY CAN'T BLACK AMERICANS

155
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,326
DETERMINE THEIR OWN SELF

156
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,360
INTEREST BY THEMSELVES.

157
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,895
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE

158
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,662
LIBERAL MEDIA TELL THEM WHAT TO

159
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,697
DO.

160
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,533
IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON BALANCE,

161
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,168
DONALD TRUMP'S TRADE AGENDA,

162
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,336
MANUFACTURING AGENDA,

163
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,171
IMMIGRATION EVEN GENTLEMAN, IS

164
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,172
BENEFICIAL TO BLACK VOTERS.

165
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,074
POLICY-WISE.

166
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,609
AND YOU CAN DISLIKE HIM FOR

167
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,310
OTHER THINGS, THAT'S FINE, BUT

168
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,212
ON BALANCE IT'S FAIR FOR BLACK

169
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,114
AMERICANS TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

170
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:20,520
I CAN CONSIDER THE TRUMP AGENDA.

171
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:24,657
>> BACK IN 2005, AT LEAST IN THE

172
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,493
LAST -- RECENT PAST, KANYE WEST

173
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:34,333
APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING THAT.

174
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,035
>> Juan: I WAS SOME ONE HIGHLY

175
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:36,803
CRITICAL WHEN HE SAID THAT ABOUT

176
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:37,537
PRESIDENT BUSH.

177
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:38,204
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS

178
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,172
TALKING ABOUT.

179
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,374
HERE YOU COME, WHY CAN'T BLACK

180
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,708
PEOPLE BE OPEN-MINDED ABOUT

181
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,209
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

182
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,611
GUESS WHAT, JESSE, BY YOUR OWN

183
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,647
MEASURE 92% OF BLACK PEOPLE SAID

184
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,615
OUR SELF INTERESTS IS NOT BEING

185
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,616
SERVED BY THE AGENDA BEING

186
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,819
PROMOTED BY THIS PRESIDENT.

187
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,420
>> Jesse: HE CAN'T THINK FOR

188
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:54,754

SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT TO MAKE.

00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,569
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE SHOULD BE

377
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,074
BACK IN D.C. BY SATURDAY.

378
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,675
PROBABLY SATURDAY, A SFO IN

379
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,310
GERMANY FOR A CHECKUP, THEN

380
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,378
RETURNING TO AMERICA A BIG WIN

381
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,080
FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND

382
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,414
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE GLAD

383
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,849
THAT PASTOR BRUNSON IS BEING

384
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,317
RETURNED TO AMERICA.

385
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,051
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN HELD IN

386
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:26,819
THE FIRST PLACE.

387
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,053
BACK TO THE STORY WE WERE

388
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,455
TALKING ABOUT, JESSE AND JUAN

389
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,957
HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT KANYE

390
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,025
WEST MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE

391
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,827
AND REACTION TO IT.

392
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,896
GREG AND JEDEDIAH HADN'T HAD A

393
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,631
CHANCE.

394
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,199
SGG GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE PASTOR,

395
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,933
WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO

396
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,601
DOESN'T BLINK.

397
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,335
THEY KNEW HE WASN'T GOING TO

398
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,670
CHANGE HIS MIND.

399
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,738
>> Dana: AND THE ECONOMY IS IN A

400
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,474
FREE FALL.

401
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,075
>>> Greg: I WANT TO ADDRESS THE

402
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,477
CENTRAL ARGUMENT THAT LEMON AND

403
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,878
OTHERS HAVE, WHEN YOU DESCRIBE

404
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,579
SOMEBODY AS A MINSTREL OR A

405
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,014
PROP.

406
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,016
I'VE LEARNED IN MY LIFE, ANY

407
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,084
CRITICISM THAT CAN BE APPLIED

408
00:11:59,085 --> 00:11:59,852
EVERYWHERE IS USELESS.

409
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,153
IT'S POINTLESS.

410
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,356
FOR EXAMPLE, I COULD JUST AS

411
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,058
EASILY LOOK AT DON LEMON AND SAY

412
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,093
WOW CNN PULLED OUT THEIR PROP,

413
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,195
THEY NEEDED SOMEBODY TO TALK

414
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,663
ABOUT KANYE, SO THEY CALLED UP

415
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:11,297
THE BLACK GUY.

416
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,898
YOU CAN USE THIS.

417
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,634
YOU CAN USE THIS ON "THE FIVE"

418
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,936
WITH JUAN, I CAN CALL YOU A PROP

419
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,237
BUT I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

420
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,973
THIS SORT OF CRITICISM CAN BE

421
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:21,941
APPLIED ANYWHERE THERE ARE

422
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:22,942
BLACKS AND WHITES TOGETHER.

423
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,678
THAT'S MY POINT.

424
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,379
WHEREVER YOU SEE AN OLIVE BRANCH

425
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,315
BETWEEN A BLACK PERSON AND A

426
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,217
WHITE PERSON, SOMEBODY CAN SAY,

427
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,253
HA, THE WHITE IS USING HIM AS A

428
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:34,887
MINSTREL AND THE BLACK IS

429
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:35,921
SEEKING POWER.

430
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,256
YOU CAN SAY THAT FOR EVERYTHING.

431
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,958
THAT'S WHY IT'S DANGEROUS, WHY

432
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,593
NOT JUST TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS.

433
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,695
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE

434
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,197
ACTUALLY 6G A DIALOGUE, WHEN YOU

435
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,999
REDUCE SOMEBODY TO A MINSTREL,

436
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,035
OR YOU MAKE -- OR YOU HAVE THE

437
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,271
GAL TO ACTUALLY BRING UP HIS

438
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,974
LATE MOTHER TO MAKE A POINT,

439
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,076
USED HIS LATE MOTHER AS A VESSEL

440
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,677
FOR YOUR OWN ENVY, WHAT I SAW

441
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,214
THERE, I SAW LEMON, A PERSON,

442
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,883
WHO FELT INEFFECTUAL, HE'S NOT

443
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,551
PART OF THE GAME.

444
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,853
HE SEES WHAT'S ON GOING ON IN

445
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,556
THE WHITE HOUSE, LEMON IS SAYING

446
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,757
WHY CAN'T THAT BE ME, THAT'S NOT

447
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:12,958
FAIR, I SHOULD BE THERE.

448
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,127
HE WENT AFTER THIS GUY, BECAUSE

449
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,996
THIS GUY HAS THE GUTS TO STAND

450
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:17,663
UP AND TAKE THE SLINGS AND

451
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,298
ARROWS.

452
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,667
IF CNN WERE AROUND 2,000 YEARS

453
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,102
AGO, THE C WOULD STAND FORS

454
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,970
CRUCIFY HIM.

455
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,573
>> Dana: JEDEDIAH WHAT DO YOU

456
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,575
THINK ABOUT THE COMMENTS HE'S

457
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,342
MENTALLY ILL, THAT FELT OVER THE

458
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,877
LINE.

459
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,346
>> WHAT BOTHERS ME, THEY HAVE

460
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,415
INFAN TALLIZED KANYE.

461
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,319
HE'S SUCCESSFUL, A SUCCESSFUL

462
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,954
BUSINESSMAN, NOT TALKING

463
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,355
NONSENSE, STOP AND FRISK, HE WAS

464
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,023
TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE CARES

465
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,424
ABOUT.

466
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,692
WHAT DO YOU THINK ALL OF THE

467
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,893
CELEBRITIES THAT WENT INTO THE

468
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:48,727
OBAMA WHITE HOUSE, YOU THINK

469
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,529
THEY WERE ALL POLICY EXPERTS?

470
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,965
THEY WENT IN AND SAT DOWN, DANA

471
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:53,332
PERINO?

472
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,633
NO, THEY HAD AN OPINION, THEY

473
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,035
CARED ABOUT ISSUES, THEY WENT

474
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,236
IN, THEY MADE THEIR CASE.

475
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,204
THE CRITICISM FROM THE RIGHT WAS

476
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,139
NOT PERSONAL ATTACKS OF THOSE

477
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,307
PEOPLE.

478
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,975
IT WAS NOT SAYING THINGS WHICH

479
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,310
HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT KANYE THAT

480
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,613
HE'S DUMB, HE'S SICK, HE'S A

481
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,082
MADMAN, A TRAITOR.

482
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,650
PEOPLE WERE SAYING, FOLKS ON THE

483
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,952
LEFT, WERE GOING IN, CELEBRITIES

484
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,253
ON THE LEFT GOING IN TO MEET

485
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,455
WITH OBAMA AND ALL THAT, THE

486
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,524
COMMENTARY WAS, WELL THIS IS

487
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,692
TYPICAL, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS AND

488
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,960
HOLLYWOOD ARE HAND IN HAPPENED.

489
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:24,129
NO ONE WAS GOING OUT THERE AND

490
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,230
SAYING PERSONALLY, GEORGE

491
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,732
CLOONEY IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

492
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,234
THIS IS OVER THE LINE.

493
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,936
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT

494
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,105
HANDLE DISSENT.

495
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,273
THEY CAN'T HANDLE DISSENT.

496
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,975
SOME ONE WHO HAS LIVED IN

497
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,076
NEW YORK CITY HER WHOLE LIFE, I

498
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,511
WENT TO COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, I

499
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,980
TAUGHT IN LIBERAL ACADEMIA, WHEN

500
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,214
YOU STAND OUT, THERE IS A

501
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,683
PATTERN ON THE LEFT OF HAVING TO

502
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,151
MARGINALIZE THAT PERSON, HAVING

503
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,653
TO POINT OUT THERE'S SOMETHING

504
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,854
WRONG WITH THEM, DRIVE THEM OUT.

505
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,888
THEY ARE TRYING TO RUIN THIS

506
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,190
GUY'S CAREER.

507
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,558
AND RUIN HIS CREDIBILITY.

508
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,292
AND THEY'RE GOING TO STOP AT

509
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,560
NOTHING.

510
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,694
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT

511
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,996
WHETHER I AGREE WITH KANYE OR

512
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,263
NOT THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR SHOULD

513
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,033
NOT BE ACCEPTED.

514
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,501
>> Juan: GREG, I DON'T WANT IT

515
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,669
TO GO WITHOUT COMMENT, I DON'T

516
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,139
THINK I'M A TOKEN.

517
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,408
>>> Greg: THE SEE THE POINT.

518
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,176
>> Juan: I DON'T AGREE, NO ONE

519
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,678
WOULD SAY THAT TO YOU.

520
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,746
I DON'T THINK GIVEN MY RECORD

521
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:18,183
THERE'S ANYWAY YOU SAY, OH, JUAN

522
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,451
WILLIAMS IS SUPERFICIAL.

523
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,320
GS I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

524
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,355
LOOKING AT COLOR, OH, THERE'S A

525
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,357
BLACK PERSON AND A WHITE PERSON.

526
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,393
>> Juan: YOU AS A WHITE PERSON,

527
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,894
I WOULD SAY, LISTEN, THIS IS

528
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,263
WHAT JEDEDIAH IS LOOKING AT,

529
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,431
LET'S MAKE A JUDGMENT.

530
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,733
WHEN I LOOK AT THE SUBSTANCE I

531
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:35,834
SAW NOTHING BUT A PUBLIC REWHAT

532
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:36,802
ISES OPPORTUNITY.

533
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,470
PUT ON BY THE PRESIDENT.

534
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,072
MAYBE KANYE DECIDING IT HELPS

535
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,108
HIS REPUTATION.

536
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,009
>>> Greg: I AM THE TOKEN SHORT

537
00:15:44,010 --> 00:00:00,000
PERSON.
