some of the president's Republican allies on Capitol Hill warned of the political perils of such an action I have confidence in Muller the president ought to have confidence in Mahler and I think to answer your question it would be suicide for the president to want to talk about fire and Mahler I'm not concerned that he'll fire Muller I don't think he'll fire roses Dana I can't think of any reason to do it I'm confident that would be the beginning the end of his presence and he's not going to do that I think the president is too smart to to fire mr. Muller if he did it wouldn't in the investigation more I'm joined by Pennsylvania Republican congressman charlie dent mr. dent thank you for this what is the feeling among members of the House he talked to on your side of the aisle the Republican side about trumps situation he knows what he's done wrong he may not know how illegal some of the things he did weren't wrong but he knows much more than Lindsey Graham or Charlie Grassley or anybody that Chuck Grassley knows he knows what he's done he knows what he faces from Muller so I don't really care what anybody else says except what will they do if he fires Muller well I'll tell you what the Republican colleagues Ivan speaking would think it would be a devastating mistake for the president to fire director Muller under any circumstances I think most of us recognize this would be the equivalent of a Saturday night massacre an Archibald Cox moment if you will be politically paralyzing even more so than we already are debilitating and I just don't know how he'd be able to function because that would that would consume everything a firing a Muller so I think he has to trust the director Muller and let him do his work he's a man of honor integrity and you know if you're as a Trey Gaudi had said you know if you're if you if you believe you've done nothing wrong act like it do you believe Trump believes he's done nothing wrong in his business affairs I have no idea what the President believes III really don't all I can say is it it seems to me that this issue is even more serious now than it was two days ago I can't imagine that DOJ and the FBI would on a whim enter into the office in the hall of the personal attorney of the presidents when you're saying two different things let me ask you this explain why Trump will never let anybody see his tax returns why he keeps coming up with this fib of his lie that he's being audited he took a lot of heat in 16 in the election and he would never Lenny buddy see his tax returns and now it seems to me that you're you're saying you trust him you don't think he's done anything wrong that has nothing to hide no no I'd say that I said that no Kris I said you should trust Muller to do the investigation I didn't say yes come on Adam he's got something to hide and mowers gonna find it and then he's dead right well look if you're asking me I said the president released his tax returns of course I think he should he should be much more transparent than he has been and we're gonna end up I'm sure that director Muller is gonna find out what he needs to know so I can't understand why the president has been so reluctant to release it I suspect he's concerned about financial entanglements and I'm sure will be politically embarrassing that's why he's not releasing the tax returns there's things we know congressman we know that his lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to stormy Daniels to keep quiet we know that now we know there was money paid to the owners of the National Enquirer to test to buy and kill the story of Karen McDougal I'm not God talking about the morality of this I'm just talking the legality there are questions about whether these constitute implicit campaign contributions by those involved particularly mr. Cohen to the campaign of Donald Trump and therefore should have been filed under the FEC laws that's a fair question we're back to the John John Edwards matter and I'll tell you I can't understand I think mr. Cohen has a real problem here if the president is to be believed he seemed to indicate that he had no awareness of Michael Cohen entering into this agreement with MS Daniels right now which strikes me is very end you know how can you enter in their agreement on behalf of your client if your clients not aware of it and as the agreement binding I think this is a huge problem particularly for mr. Cohen in that matter but also obviously for the president there is also the pattern here would they call the mo and criminal justice the president's tendency is to use his enormous wealth to cover up problems and it's certainly not illogical of course if he had a problem that he didn't want anybody to know about a week before the election 2016 involving miss sub Dan he pay her some amount of money he didn't want everybody to know about Karen McDougal so he paid the National Enquirer people had to national if I buy this story and kill it if that's his practice it seems to me you want to know a lot of stuff in those papers of Michael Cowan what else is in his documents what else is in his drawers isn't in his phone in his house and is a hotel room in his office all that stuff is now in the hands of the special of the US prosecutors in New York isn't that something for him to be afraid of absolutely okay all those questions you just asked well that's exactly what it appears at the DOJ and the FBI are trying to get answers to right now they're going in there and they're gonna be they're gonna be asking those questions about you know who paid 130 thousand dollars was there a reimbursement you know what did the president know when did he know it you know this is all what they're after hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
