00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:20,861
TO TAKE HIS SEAT.

6
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:24,098
A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT WHICH

7
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:26,901
REMINDS US THAT FREEDOM IS A

8
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,670
TRADITION PASSED DOWN FROM

00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,941
IT IS UP TO REDEDICATE

00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,544
AND WISDOM OF OUR FOUNDERS.

13
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:38,145
AND IT IS UP TO US TO RENEW

BRIAN: WE'RE BACK TOGETHER

00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,899
SEAN, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

27
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,867
THE PRESIDENT, HIS COMMENTS

28
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:00,734
LAST NIGHT AND THEN BEFORE

HE GOT TO THAT THOUGH, HE

30
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:04,371
DID APOLOGIZE TO BRETT

00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:05,973
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY FOR

32
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:08,075
WHAT HE WENT THROUGH IN THAT

33
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,977
VERY BRUISING CONFIRMATION

34
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:11,111

REPUBLICAN THAT WONDERED

00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,650
WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT

39
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:17,718
ELECTION WAS GOING TO MAKE

40
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,987
OR WONDERED HOW TRUMP WOULD

00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:26,927
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

44
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:29,196
THE SECOND SUPREME COURT,

45
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,097
THE 26TH CIRCUIT.

46
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:33,968
AND DOZENS OF APPEAL COURSE

47
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,035
THIS PRESIDENT'S LEGACY WILL

48
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,537
GO DOWN AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS

49
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:37,938
RESHAPED THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

50
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,908
TO STRICT CONSTRUCTAL LIST.

51
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,743
THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE WIN FOR

52
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:43,711
THIS PRESIDENT.

53
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,379
IT HAS GALVANIZED

54
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,347
REPUBLICANS HEADED INTO A

55
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:48,148
KEY MIDTERM ELECTION.

56
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,816
AINSLEY: WHAT'S THE IMPACT

57
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,917
OF THE PRESIDENT STICKING BY

58
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:50,351
HIM?

59
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:52,353
YOU HAD JUSTICE KAVANAUGH

60
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:53,487
LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENT

61
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,322
YESTERDAY AND SAYING THANK

62
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,258
YOU FOR YOUR UNWAVERING

63
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:57,591
SUPPORT.

64
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:58,859
>> LOOK, ANXIOUSLY.

65
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,227
I KNOW YOU HAD CHARLIE ON A

66
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:01,395
LITTLE WHILE AGO TALKING

67
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:02,630
ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THIS

68
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:02,997
ELECTIONS.

69
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,664
AMERICA FIRST HAS BEEN OUT

70
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,799
THERE WITH OVER $20 MILLION

71
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,133
IN ADS.

72
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:07,001
THIS IS GOING TO BE TIGHT.

73
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:07,768
WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND

74
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,837
KAVANAUGH DID WAS GALVANIZED

75
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,237
REPUBLICANS.

76
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,905
THERE WAS A MASSIVE

77
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:13,874
ENTHUSIASM GAP FAVORING

78
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,908
DEMOCRATS 30 DAYS OUT.

79
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,410
THIS HAS MADE SURE THAT

80
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,045
EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN

81
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,313
UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE

82
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:21,282
OF A REPUBLICAN SENATE AND A

83
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:23,183
REPUBLICAN HOUSE VERSUS ONE

84
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,318
CONTROLLED BY CHUCK SCHUMER

85
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,352
AND NANCY PELOSI.

86
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,321
THIS HAS TIGHTENED THE GAP.

87
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,355
REPUBLICANS ARE NOW OUT

88
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:28,656
THERE.

89
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:29,923
NOT AS MUCH.

90
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,525
WE HAVE GOT CLOSE RACES IN

91
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,794
PLACES LIKE INDIANA,

92
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:34,762
FLORIDA, MISSOURI, MONTANA.

93
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,163
WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE.

94
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,299
BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE NOW

95
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,067
UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT FIGHT

96
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,335
MEANS AND THE NEED TO GET

97
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:43,370
OUT THERE AND VOTE WITH

98
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,373
WEEKS LEFT.

99
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,541
BRIAN: A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

100
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:52,112
CNN PUT OUT A POLL AND THE

101
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:52,713
36%.

102
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,914
OTHER AT 45%.

103
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,450
IT'S NOW AT 41% WITH THIS

104
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,819
APPROVAL AT 52%.

105
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,754
SO IT'S GONE UP IN THE RIGHT

106
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:01,121
DIRECTION.

107
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,157
NOW THE GENERIC POLL FROM

108
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:04,858
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

109
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,026
WHEN ASKED WHO DO YOU WANT

110
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,628
IN OFFICE IN YOUR STATE, IN

111
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,930
YOUR DISTRICT IS NOW JUST A

112
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,398
7 POINT GAP.

113
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,466
WHAT ARE THE REPUBLICANS UP

114
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,034
AGAINST RIGHT NOW?

115
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,803
>> WELL, AGAIN, I THINK IN A

116
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:16,670
MIDTERM ELECTION YOU HAVE TO

117
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,005
LOOK STATE BY STATE.

118
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:18,906
DISTRICT BY DISTRICT.

119
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,240
IN THE SENATE I THINK WE

120
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,275
HAVE A LOT OF CLOSE RACES

121
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:22,810
BUT I THINK WE ARE POISED TO

122
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,813
PICK UP A BUNCH OF SEATS.

123
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,681
YOU LOOK AT HEITKAMP IN

124
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:28,148
NORTH DAKOTA.

125
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:29,383
NO QUESTION KEVIN CRAMER IS

126
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:30,351
POISED TO BE THE NEXT

127
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,985
SENATOR FROM THERE.

128
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:33,754
SENATOR RICK SCOTT -- EXCUSE

129
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,621
ME GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT IS

130
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:36,657
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB IN

131
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:37,991
FLORIDA AGAINST BILL NELSON.

132
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:40,828
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A

133
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,328
REPUBLICAN PICKUP.

134
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,129
MARSHA BLACKBURN HAS SURGED

135
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,131
AHEAD IN TENNESSEE.

136
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,633
IN THE SENATE WE ARE LOOKING

137
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:46,934
GOOD.

138
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,703
MITCH MCCONNELL'S NOMINATION

139
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:50,604
SOLIDIFIED THAT IN THE HOUSE

140
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,805
I HAVE GOT TO BE HONEST,

141
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:52,539
IT'S CLOSE.

142
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,507
REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET OUT

143
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,008
THERE AND VOTE DISTRICT BY

144
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:55,376
DISTRICT.

145
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:56,110
WE ARE LOOKING AT CONTINUING

146
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,745
TO PUT MONEY INTO THESE KEY

147
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:58,579
DISTRICTS TO PUT THEM OVER

148
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,346
THE TOP.

149
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:00,647
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE.

150
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:02,983
I THINK THAT THIS LAST FEW

151
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:05,586
WEEKS HAS REALLY HELPED

152
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:07,454
GALVANIZE THE ENTHUSIASM

153
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,889
AMONG KEY -- IN KEY

154
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,457
DISTRICTS AS WE HEAD INTO.

155
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,091
THIS.

156
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:11,825
STEVE: RIGHT.

157
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:12,459
>> ONE REALLY INTERESTING

158
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,128
POINT THAT'S NOT BEING

159
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:14,561
TALKED ABOUT.

160
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:16,430
IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE

161
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,064

162
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:21,434

WISCONSIN.

165
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,137
PLACES THAT HAVE BENEFITED

166
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,204

00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,450

HELP HIM.

178
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:40,888
THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT A

179
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,723
LOT OF THOSE KEY MIDWEST

AGRICULTURE BASED OR

00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,260
MANUFACTURING BASED.

183
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:46,994
THE PRESIDENT'S

184
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:47,795
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THOSE

185
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:48,629
FRONTS IN PARTICULAR ARE

186
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,598
GOING TO BENEFIT THEM

187
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:52,666
HEADING INTO THE KEY.

188
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,134
BRIAN: DON'T BE SURPRISED IF

00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,636
NORTH CAROLINA, THE FLOODS.

190
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:56,637
PEOPLE HAVE HISTORIC LOSSES

191
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:57,871
HOW THE PRESIDENT IS GOING

192
00:04:57,872 --> 00:04:59,173
TO REACT THERE GETTING THEM

193
00:04:59,174 --> 00:04:59,473

194
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:00,741
NOW WITH A HURRICANE ABOUT

195
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,943
TO HIT FLORIDA, WHICH IS IN

196
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,812
THE BALANCE FOR GOVERNORSHIP

197
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:07,347
AS WELL AS THE SENATE SEAT,

198
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,482
PERFORMANCE MATTER THERE ON

199
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:09,483
BOTH COUNTS.

200
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:09,950
>> YEAH.

201
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:10,350
ABSOLUTELY.

202
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,985
I THINK THAT'S THE NUMBER

203
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:12,986
ONE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT

204
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:14,054
IS TO PROTECT AND CARE FOR

205
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:15,456
ITS PEOPLE.

206
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:16,657
ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF

207
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:16,990
TRAGEDY.

208
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,125
AND SO WHILE WE PRAY FOR

209
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,893
THESE FOLKS AS THEY HEAD

210
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,628
INTO THESE KEY MOMENTS.

211
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:22,830
BOTH THE VICTIMS OF THE

212
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:23,831
RECENT STORMS AND THE ONES

213
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,265
THAT ARE ABOUT TO HIT.

214
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,834
HOW THEY PERFORM AT BOTH A

215
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:27,868
STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WILL

216
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,903
BE IMPORTANT.

217
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:30,337
STEVE: SURE.

218
00:05:30,338 --> 00:00:00,000
JANICE IS GOING TO GIVE US
