happy Friday thanks for joining us tonight this is a live news show right now it's Friday night in this era in American news and politics that means you should keep your tray table stowed and your seat in an upright position because anything could happen and in fact we do need to start tonight with something new to report concerning the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who appears to be hanging on to his job in the Trump cabinet not just by a thread but by a thread that is invisible that has been cut and retied several times in expertly and it's either actively Freyr or on fire right now depending on how you squint at it one of the elements of controversy around Scott Pruett has had to do with the upper level staffing that he's done at his agency at EPA when Fox News reporter Edie Henry this week interviewed Scott Pruitt that was the part that staffing part was where they got into their biggest fight why did you go around the president in the White House to give pay raises to two staffers I did not my staff did and I found out about that yesterday and I changed it somebody being fired for them that it should not have been done in a minute maybe there would be some accountability of career person or political person I don't know I don't know you don't know who does find out about this yesterday and I corrected the action so we are in the process and finding out how it took place incorrectly so hang on were both of these staffers we've got these large pay raises or friends of yours I believe from Oklahoma right they are staffers here on the agents then they're from over there friends of yours well they serve a very important person you didn't know that they got these large pay raise I did not know that they get the pay raises until yesterday okay one of them got a pay raise of let's see 28,000 the other was fifty six thousand dollars do you know what the median income in this country is no 157 thousand a year okay so one of your French from Oklahoma got a pay raise that's the medium it did not get a raise they did not get pay raise they did not they did not I stopped that yesterday so you've stopped it yeah are you embarrassed that it should not have happened and the officials that were involved in that process should not have done what they did I love the part where he says their staffers here in this so hang on these staffers they're friends of yours from Oklahoma right their staffers here in the agency they're friends of yours and then Scott Pruett says they serve a very important person there is so yes they do serve a very important person but the substance of that public explanation from EPA Administrator Scott Pruett is that he had no idea about the these big pay raises 30,000 50,000 $50,000 pay raises that went to his staffers we later found out that the money for those pay raises came from the Safe Drinking Water Act where it is in the law that an administrator can do that because the EPA is supposed to be able to hire engineers and scientific experts quickly to respond to drinking water emergencies that is not what Scott Pruett used that money for now he's saying publicly that he had no idea how this happened he only found out about it in the press this week it was news to him he definitely didn't do it himself he says he's not even sure who might have done it but when he figures it out they're gonna be in trouble well the Washington Post now reports that Scott Pruett not only knew about those pay raises for his staffers he signed off on them himself the post citing three Trump administration officials confirming that Scott Pruett endorsed the idea last month of giving these substantial pay raises to two of his new staffers so according to this multiple source report in the post Scott Pruett is lying publicly about one of the things he's been caught out for in this scandal Avalanche sheet that has currently turned him into a rolling PA administrator snowball but here's something new on top of that last week we talked a little bit about the amazing trip to Morocco that Scott Pruett took in December it was amazing for lots of reasons first of all he took seven staffers with him on the trip including one of the Oklahoma staffers who he gave the giant raised to and he's now denying it anything to do with giving her a raise but including her he brought seven staffers plus his security detail now The Associated Press reports just a little while ago tonight just within the past couple of hours that Pruett security detail was we now know a multi-million dollar affair according to new documents reviewed tonight by The Associated Press quote Eph EPA Chief Scott Pruitt's concern for his safety came at a steep cost for taxpayers as his swollen security detail blew through overtime budgets and at times diverted officers from investigating environmental crimes so those officers could instead protect him altogether the agency spent millions of dollars for a 20 member security detail that is three times the size of his predecessors security contingent and hers was only part-time so we don't know exactly how many members of Scott Pruitt's 20 person full-time security team got to go on the trip to Morocco but it was Scott Pruett 7 staffers plus the security team flying international first class I paid for by us the taxpayers happily that trip came with a Saturday night layover in Paris France we learned yesterday that after the Saturday night layover in Paris Pruett and company didn't actually show up for their Sunday morning connecting flight from Paris to Morocco oops that meant another day and night in Paris on the taxpayers dime finally on Monday they did manage to catch another flight to Morocco where Pruett got down to the business of the trip and the business of the trip inexplicably was that Pruett went to Morocco to lobby government officials there that they should change their national energy strategy and start importing liquefied natural gas from the US that's not his job it is not the job of the Environmental Protection Agency to go talk other countries into importing American natural gas that is nowhere near what the American APA is supposed to do now we talked about that story last night the reason we focused on that last night is because at the time of that inexplicable lavish taxpayer-funded trip there was only one company operating an export terminal in the whole United States for liquefied natural gas company called Cheniere the controlling shareholder of Cheniere was Carl Icahn former Trump White House official who left his position as Trump's regulatory adviser amid very serious reports that he had used that position to benefit companies he was invested in and to just flat out make himself money on the markets Carl Icahn also reportedly got scott pruett his job running the EPA according to Patrick rad and Keith last year in the New Year after scott pruett interviewed with trump at Trump Tower Trump asked Pruett to seal the deal by walking two blocks north to Carl ikons office because Trump told him Carl had some questions for him before Scott crew scott pruett could be greenlit for the job Carl Icahn apparently asked his questions Pruett gave the right answers he got greenlit he got the EPA job and then soon thereafter Pruett went to Morocco and hooked up Carl's company with a big policy ass that had nothing whatsoever to do with the EPA so that Morocco trip is also an amazing story because the top lobbyist for Cheniere Energy is the lobbyist whose house Pruett has been living in in Washington DC for 50 bucks a night so this Morocco thing is an astonishing circumstance in lots of ways but but check this out put this in your liquefied natural gas pipe and smoke it one of the people on that amazeballs trip was a newly hired senior counsel at the EPA named Samantha Dreyfuss now in the middle of this scandal swirling around Scott Pruett this EPA staffer Samantha trayvis she quit I found out this week she was quitting and nobody was quite sure why when we first got word that she was quitting but then we learned that this letter had been sent to the EPA's Inspector General ahead of Samantha Davis's sudden resignation Senator Tom Carper of Delaware 'he's the top Democrat on the Environment Committee and he sent this letter this week asking the inspector general at Pruitt's agency to investigate reports that this senior staffer for Scott Pruitt the person who's actually said to be his closest aide at the agency according to Carper's letter there are reports that she was being paid full-time for that senior counsel job at the EPA even though she was not actually showing up for work for three months according to Carper's letter she did not show up for work despite being paid full-time in November 2017 December 2017 and January 2018 if that's true that's enough that's an amazing gig right I mean look at that timeline if what senator is asking about is true that would mean that Scot Pruitt's senior counsel at EPA was getting paid for a full-time gig and that included her getting to go on the Morocco trip where she got to fly international first-class prepare to Paris for the weekend and then on to Morocco whoo-hoo and she got to avoid that awkward thing where you come back from the awesome trip and you get dirty looks from your co-workers who heard how awesome it was but they didn't get to go and so you don't really know if you can talk she didn't have to deal with any of that because she actually didn't have to go to work for months so that senior council again described as the closest staffer to Scott Pruitt at the EPA she has now resigned in the middle of this scandal I said Carper sent that letter this week he sent it last week we've learned about her resignation this week Scott Pruett is still in his job she's gone but we've got new information about this issue with Pruitt's senior counsel that that may show this to be an even bigger problem than it's already understood to be this new information tonight comes from the committee where Carper's the ranking Democrats the Senate Environment Committee a staffer on the committee tonight gave us some of the background of what led to this request from Senator Carper just so you know this is exactly how Carper put it this is what Carper said to the EPA inspector general quote I write to request that the Inspector General conduct an immediate review of EPA's efforts to prevent fraud related to employee time and attendance including an investigation into potential fraud committed by Scott Pruitt's political staff specifically the senator says I have been informed that miss Samantha Davis did not attend work or perform her duties for much if not all of the months of November 2017 through January 2018 I am additionally informed that mr. Davis was likely compensated as a full-time employee throughout that time well now we can report that what led to this sort of remarkable claim is that this committee the Environment Committee in the Senate was contacted by multiple sources on this matter over a period of four to six weeks multiple sources contacted the committee via calls emails and in-person meetings all raising the same issue about Samantha being the senior counsel at the EPA but her not actually being at work the sources were told include former EPA political appointees current EPA political appointees as well as current EPA staff we're told all sources that contacted the committee expressed similar concerns so tonight 64 Democratic members of Congress signed a joint statement calling on Scott Pruett to resign that was before the new reporting from the AP about the multi-million dollar security costs and that was before this new reporting tonight about his senior counsel and multiple staffers including current political appointees raising the issue with the Senate staff Senate committee that oversees the EPA raising this question of whether or not Davis actually had to come to work in order to earn her senior counsel salary working for Scott Pruett but like I said she has resigned as of this second Scott Pruett is still in his job and on Donald Trump's cabinet but the night is young and stuff happens on Fridays the one very high-profile person who is definitely leaving Washington tonight is HR McMaster hope you saw this footage today do you see this day remarkable footage of West Wing staff and Security Council staff coming outside onto the grounds of the White House to cheer for him and applaud for him as he left the White House for the last time general HR McMaster was fired by President Trump about two weeks ago today was his his last day and he went out with this remarkable show of support from his colleagues and from White House staff today but he is now gone and the new national security adviser the president's third after Mike Flynn who's awaiting sentencing and HR McMaster the new national security adviser john bolton is due to start on monday you probably want to stick a pin in that for now because there are real questions about john bolton starting on monday real questions out of today's news when we getting to that in just a minute with Rolling Stone reporter Tim Dickinson tonight but before we get to the substantive issue of John Bolton taking this job and the question of if that's gonna work also just consider the immediate timeline here and when we got those that footage today of McMaster leaving and all the staff coming out and applauding him and everything that was not a show he left he's actually he's gone John Bolton we're told is due to start first thing Monday morning is that anybody work for the weekend there's no National Security Advisor I guess hold tight hold tight particularly because there's a lot of international a poking going on right now including the president trying to start this trade war with China you saw the markets fell off a cliff today again because of that the president of Mexico has previously been pretty even-keeled about President Trump he's now making Stern nationally televised denunciations of the US government over the president's most recent remarks insulting Mexico and insulting Mexicans and of course there's what's going on with Russia and a whole bunch of really important stuff happen today when it comes to Russia and that's next stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
