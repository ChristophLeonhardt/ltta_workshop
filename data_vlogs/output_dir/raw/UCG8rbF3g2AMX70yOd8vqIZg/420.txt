00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,560
So I'm not going to lie guys, I'm a little out of energy, I'm kinda tired right now

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,920
I've been working out like a beast

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,620
and it's slowly catching up to me but luckily I have some energy on the way

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,420
let's see if I timed this right

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,980

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,480

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,280

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,560

a song

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,800
I think it's going to be a Valentines Day song, its about love and romance and sex

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,040

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,309
