let me get straight to the point yeah
how was he eat even though that was like
time ago but how is it cuz mine was crap
you see me and my family we have to go
see my uncle but he a fireman for like
in Japan
well Bradford and that means only one
thing
Asian family road trips okay this is how
a family should road trip goes my dad
makes everyone in one car let's see how
many Bucky's we can get in one car hmm
my mom my brother my sister my
grandmother my grandfather my auntie's
my uncle's my cousins and then he's fast
printing at random people going hey you
gonna go ahead you coming back to Lunas
no she'll just shut up I said you're
going there is 20 people in the divers
yes miss yes miss a bit but part get me
I get and the guys like but I don't know
who you are
now another point why do you never see
Asian people as service stations you
know why because because if you're Asian
your mum is the service station
according summer said spring rolls puffs
you bring that one magic container that
can feed the whole of Dubai and if
you're Asian you will know about the
legendary the Louvre mosques
from what can I say Asian people love
their team and privates like war to us
but by his brand like us so basically
you're stuck in a car with like 24
packings behind you you're thinking it
can't get any worse
and then your mom puts the music on my
dad's road rage is without a doubt the
worst thing I've ever seen in my life
he would come up with the most most
random dirty rough but he don't even
make sense
Hey Appaji that's not a cuss that's
that's more of a unnecessary disturbing
request so then I start crying and then
I look to my dad and I realized he's
driving on the m25 like this reading a
map at the same time so we were to hear
a better term if it crash okay why do
agent payments to use world max it's
more 1973 breath why did so big have so
many times I have tried to get my dad to
use a TomTom but he just makes an issue

my dad did people go once but every time
the woman on the TomTom would speak he
would say the same thing are you shut up

worth it I remembered something a friend
cannot be considered as a friend until

time of need - behind your back and
three after your death and as a Muslim
and as a human being and as a friend I
must do the right thing inshallah why
