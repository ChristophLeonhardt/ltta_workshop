This image has become
a powerful representation
of the Trump administration’s
crackdown on immigration:
a 2-year old girl sobbing,
as U.S. border patrol agents
searched her mother.
“If you cross the border unlawfully,
then we will prosecute you.
If you are smuggling a child,
then we will
prosecute you.
And that child may be separated
from you as required by law.”
The Trump White House’s tactic
of systematically separating
migrant families is
a dramatic shift.
There have been
cases of families
being separated under the
previous two administrations.
But it’s always
been the exception,
not the rule.
That said, Trump’s
crackdowns are happening
against the backdrop
of more than a decade
of stepped-up enforcement
at the Southern border.
In 2005,
President George W. Bush
launched “Operation Streamline”
along the Texas border.
He was responding to a spike
in apprehensions there.
The program called
for criminally
prosecuting all migrants.
“We’re going to get
control of our borders.
We’re making this country safer
for all our citizens.”
The idea of zero tolerance
took root under Bush,
and it’s what Trump has
used to model his policy after.
The Bush-era program
meant that migrants who
were caught in
certain border states
were put through
the criminal system,
not civil immigration courts.
It made exceptions for adults
traveling with children,
but others were ushered
through mass trials aimed
at deporting them quickly.
It’s a practice that’s
still around today.
“One of the things
we committed to do
was end ‘catch and release’ by
the end of fiscal year 2006.”
Under this policy,
migrants were
held until their
deportation hearing.
And that meant an increase
in beds at private detention centers.
In 2014, President Barack Obama
declared a crisis at
the Southwest border
after a surge of
unaccompanied minors,
mostly from Central America.
“We now have an actual
humanitarian crisis on the border
that only underscores
the need to drop the politics
and fix our immigration
system once and for all.”
During that child migrant crisis,
the Obama administration
also focused on
deporting people quickly
and put some through
criminal proceedings.
But it chose to hold
families together
in administrative, not
criminal detention.
The Obama administration also
set up makeshift overflow facilities.
And we saw similar images back
then, of adults and children
behind chain-link fences draped
in thermal blankets.
Now, Trump is reportedly
taking it a step further
and considering
makeshift tent cities
to detain minors
caught at the border.
The Trump administration says
it’s now merely enforcing
the letter of the law.
But images of
children in detention
have made it hard to sell
it in political terms,
and humanitarian ones, too.
