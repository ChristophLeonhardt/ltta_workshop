a while back we reported on how Donald Trump's Labor Department had this new plan that was going to change the way tips work obviously there are millions and millions of tipped workers or people who depend on tips to earn a wage I work for tenure here yeah it's been a very slow a couple of years I always forget to tip unfortunately oh well see if you say no you're not so what they wanted to do basically was changed the way that the tips are taken in and distributed and the way that the cover for this was we all know that like if you're aware people leave tips but what about the people who aren't front-of-house people who are you know Busboys are like dishwashers something like that so they said we just want to change it so that they can take in the money and then give it not just to the waiters and the hostesses but also these other people but hidden in that was the fact that there was no requirement in those changes that they give the tips back at all or that they not keep a significant portion themselves and we speculate at the time that this is probably going to cost working-class Americans a huge amount of money so how much money well the Labor Department is doing everything can't but everything they can to stop you from ever finding out the department said that the proposed rule would allow back-of-the-house workers such as dishwashers and cooks who don't typically receive tips to be part of a tip sharing pool but it doesn't actually require that the employers give them out that's the scary part now the Economic Policy Institute found that tipped workers could lose 5.8 billion dollars a year in tips as a result of this rule women and tip jobs would lose 4.6 billion dollars annually so a big portion of that and so what the Labor Department did was they had a statistical analysis of the likely effects of this change they got the results they saw the number and they said you get back in there and you change your methodology because that's gonna scare people so they did that they went back they changed her methodology they came back with the new information and they looked at and they said we're not using your analysis at all and they hid the entire thing and that is how they were going to try to hide from you the effect this is gonna have billions of dollars are going to be stolen from people who like from my experience I worked as a tipped employee for years and years I can't afford to give up a big percentage just a manager just cuz he's feeling feisty one day and that's what you're talking about right B of the owners of these restaurants are gonna just take the additional money and I just love that story for everything that says about this administration they they a try to suppress the these numbers then the numbers come back bad they say get back in there rework these numbers they come back bad again they go okay listen I want to keep those numbers off of our website just like they did with climate change just like they've done with animal abusers there used to be a clearinghouse for that that the these things are being manipulated by this administration on a level that we've never seen in a modern era and this is another example because I thought trickle-down economics mattli supposed to trickle-down but this is like a pneumatic tube of just so I mean it's really important that women are there are a lot of women in this industry and that they would lose 4.6 billion dollars annually more than than any other group than men especially at a time of me too and just the amount of sexual harassment that we know happens in the restaurant industry Oh what happens if your manager now has your tips and holds your tips and your you know like that is just yeah I hadn't thought about that we have a woman here to get because I do a lot of that either I mean the idea that that guy who wants something from you and is sexually harassing you or borderline sexually harassing or maybe even worse than that he has control over the dollars and cents that you get yeah that's that's just you might have to kill him and we don't want to create murderers that have working we're anti murder for the most part but that disempowering of women with with with the money that's a great point that is a great point that's the point of the day right there ahead and I've been covering this story like four or five times already you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
