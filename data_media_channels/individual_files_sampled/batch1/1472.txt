is there any way to stop guns printed in 3d Metal Detectors can't spot these plastic weapons they don't have serial numbers and background checks can be bypassed anyone with a 3d printer can produce the firearms at home and it's all about to get a lot easier this is inside story hello and welcome to the program my name is Peter Dobie a US Court has barred a self-described crypto anarchist from publishing the software blueprints for 3d printed guns that information is already out there on the internet but if publication had gone ahead it would have immediately become a lot easier to download the plans for the weapons and with the quality of 3d printers rapidly rising and their cost falling equally as fast that worries a lot of people not just gun control activists despite this week's court decision it's a problem that isn't going away brob reynolds in Los Angeles begins our coverage this is the computer-generated weapon that's causing the uproar a crude single-shot plastic pistol the United States of America will be the biggest exporter of terror if we fail to stop these ghost guns specifications for the gun were developed by Cody Wilson a self-styled anarchist as long as you have the right to keep and bear arms you have the right to make them in June the Trump administration abruptly gave up on a year's long legal battle to prevent him from putting the gun plans online Wilson's diagrams allow a variety of firearms models to be made by anyone including convicted criminals mentally disturbed people or children this means that more people who are dangerous will have guns and they will hurt more people with them in 3d printer technology machines extrude minuscule layers of plastic or resin that gradually build up three-dimensional objects using computerized patterns we asked professional 3d printer Peter menotti to make one for us consumer printers are available for as low as 300 dollars so anybody that has $300 can essentially print one the designs have already appeared online and have been downloaded thousands of times 3d printable guns have no serial numbers so they're untraceable they don't require permits or background checks so anybody can have one and because they're plastic they can go through any metal detector law enforcement officials are opposed and President Donald Trump questioned the action of his own administration tweeting that the idea of 3d printable guns quote doesn't seem to make much sense but the guns may be less dangerous to the public than to the person wielding them in tests by the government firearms oversight agency 3d printed guns often exploded when fired they are not as strong or precisely machined as metal guns it could explode on you you could lose a finger you could use a hand it could catch fire there's so many things that can go wrong which is why printing it is one thing using it as an entirely separate thing Democratic lawmakers are calling on Trump to overturn his administration's decision and are introducing legislation to ban the weapons but in a last-minute decision a federal judge granted a temporary injunction blocking Wilson from distributing his blueprints online the ruling came after nine states and the District of Columbia brought the matter to court the legal fight will continue Rob Reynolds al Jazeera Los Angeles well the National Rifle Association of America or NRA had this to say on 3d printed guns many anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3d printing technology will allow the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for thirty years federal laws passed in 1988 crafted with the NRA support make it unlawful to manufacture import sell ship deliver possess transfer or receive an undetectable firearm there we are here we go let's bring in our guests today joining us from New York Paul Barrett the author of Glock the rise of America's gun via Skype from Volos in Greece is Ian Overton the executive director of action on armed violence and in Washington Richard Felton he's a former regional political director for the NRA welcome to you all Paul Barrett in New York is this the criminals new best friend no I doubt it will be the criminals best friend I think it's more realistic to assume that criminals will continue to get ordinary firearms the way they get them which is to say on the black market I'm not in favor of 3d printed guns I think it's an invitation to mischief but I don't think it's going to affect the way criminals arm themselves E&O Burton how long until that mischief until the printing of weapons goes mainstream and in the United Kingdom recently there's been a spate of people using antique guns for want of a better way to get their hands or something to use for criminal ends so currently the printing of 3d guns is probably not up to spec for them using being used widespread and criminal activities but I do think in countries where gun control is hard 3d printed guns may be an attractive and viable option for criminals in the future Richard Feldman in Washington the Trump administration notoriously is gun friendly its NRA friendly can you run me through the Trump reaction to this well I don't always understand everything that the Trump administration is doing but you know when you have an internet and you have a public library system all the information that we're talking about is available already in books online it may not all be in the same spot it may not all be easy easily available but it's out there so you know when we start talking about banning parts of the internet really folks this is what it's come to you can't ban technology you can go after the people who misuse it but to think about banning it is just a fool's errand Sir Richard does that mean that you if you were president would you ban 3d printed guns or not I wouldn't ban them they're already out there and unless you plan on banning 3d printers or banning the Internet banning computers banning libraries I mean let's focus on where the problem is not on where there might be some problem at some point in the future and to the degree that 3d printed guns blow up in the hands of those who are misusing them well bully for them what a great way to stop criminals Paul Barrett in New York you can't stop the flow of information that's what Richard Feldman is saying to Washington if you can't stop the flow of information is the question not if but when well III think that's true I think people are now capable of using this technology to produce firearm like instruments and as I said at the top I think that is an invitation to mischief I think it's important to emphasize as you did in your setup piece that undetectable guns are already illegal in the United States so that people who are making undetectable plastic guns if they go out and use them in any way would be breaking the law already so again my view of this is this is an invitation to trouble and I think the Obama administration had the right view of it but I wouldn't set my hair on fire and assume that overnight criminals and terrorists are going to be flocking to 3d printed guns you know Burton in Greece 3d printers 300 $400 apiece just just unpack the risks for us here if you want to get a 3d printer and you've got the right kind of plastic how potentially dangerous is what you're doing in your basement in your backyard well I think currently the technology isn't up to scratch as Paul was saying it could blow up in your hands of course there is this a subtext that it might be in the US government's interest to say these things are dangerous because then it might stop people using them I've seen plenty of YouTube videos where people using them without them blowing up furthermore I have unreliable information that certain intelligence agencies are proliferating faulty blueprints that will then cause the guns to malfunction that aside let's fast-forward five ten years if 3d printed technology really did take an evolutionary step forward yes these things are may be readily downloadable and readily principal now the NRA is argument you have these 19th century 20th century books out there that teach you how to make a firearm of course people have been able to make firearms in their back gardens sheds for years but the point is you need a certain amount of technical know-how to make one if you could just print one off it suddenly creates a sort of you universalization of capacity and enables you to do so obviously in the United States where guns are to a penny you you won't have such an inclination to print one off if you want to cook you know go and shoot somebody because you can go and buy one out the back end of someone's car and a gun sale without any background checks which i think is appalling but let's look at Europe where they've got the hand guns are quite difficult to get a hand off yes it could be a real problem the truth of the matter is it is our control of ammunition in Europe and elsewhere but actually will be the prohibitive factor so you may be on a print off a 3d gun but if you don't get the ammo to fit it which is what criminals and Britain are finding at the moment and they actually wrapped sellotape around the rounds to use them in criminal activity then you're gonna have a hiding to nothing so yes you may be able to print them in the future but we also need to discuss the availability and the access to ammunition as well and can I just briefly push you on one point that you raised they're not wishing to get you to review your sources which bit of the security apparatus in the United States is deliberately putting out bad printing plans online as we speak well in the European entity that they've actually gone to that length to to insert a counterfeit blueprint into the mechanism this was a number of years ago actually this was five years ago when the blueprints first appeared there was one that was distributed that was shall we say a bunker one I don't know the extent to which that's been downloaded but certainly you can see that there will be a real attention paid to these 3d principal blueprints out in the wider world now the NRA argument there that you can't stop banning the Internet well you know we've banned things before the ROM beans that you can't download child pornography so I didn't I don't see a fundamental problem in saying that the ownership of 3d printed blueprints for guns in the United Kingdom where handguns are illegal could be seen as a potential cause for prosecution so nobody's talking about this just yet because the technology is not there but if the technology does get there then why can't 3d printed blueprints be seen with as much why would you need one if you weren't wanting to print one out in other words Richard coming to you just interrupt you there I want to knock that point on to Richard Feldman in Washington Richard Ian was talking there he used the word universalization if you're universalizing to create a new adverb if you're universalizing access to guns to bullets that lever chamber and rip through bone tissue and flesh you're therefore universalizing the ability for people to have a new way to kill other people well to the degree that someone outside the United States had difficulty obtaining guns for criminal misuse yeah I guess it would potentially make it easier but there's a reverse side to that there are people all over this planet that would love to have guns to protect themselves from governments and from other people when no one comes to their aid how is that relevant to this debate how is that relevant to this debate because they don't have because if they don't have access to the guns now perhaps they'll have access to them with 3d printers online okay if you're right if you're right and I'm Victoria lysing and saying you're right or wrong but if you are right in that context explained for our viewers the NRA reaction which was on a part who cop-killer bullets you know armor-piercing bullets that are specifically designed and used to kill policemen wearing body armor well you're smiling but if you're the widow of a policeman who's been killed by a cop killing bullet it's not a laughing matter so given what you've just said about defending yourself which is the NRA s fallback position of if you want to get the better of a bad guy go bad a good go buy a gun and kill a bad guy somebody oughta fill you in somebody oughta fill you in on the facts there has never been a police officer in the United States of America shot with let alone killed by an armor-piercing round so how could you speak to a widow of a police officer that wasn't shot at or killed by one of these make-believe rounds so your facts are really suspect in fact they're inaccurate incomplete and frankly just wrong right from the onset I thought the correction of course I do but could you answer my question about the NRA s reaction to 3d printed guns in the context of what you just said about people wanting to defend themselves you know I don't represent the National Rifle Association it's many years ago that I did but I represent a different group the independent firearm owners association and there are groups all around the world that are under threat from their own governments perhaps it will do some good if they can fight back when they need to it Universal eise's as you said the ability to use deadly force is it always going to be used well well governments certainly aren't used to always using their power very well when it comes to the government or the citizens I generally tend to trust the citizens over any government anywhere in the world Paul Barrett would you trust a citizen or somebody who works for the government to get to grips with the issue of 3d printed guns as I've said a couple of times I think allowing the production of firearms in this manner without the serial numbers and so forth is a is generally a bad idea and so the decision by the government to try to slow it down or stop it I think what would be a good one at the same time I'm not sure these things are a massive threat today or or anytime soon Richard Feldman doesn't Paul Barrett they're completely illuminate 100% the issue with principle guns as far as the NRA is concerned and it's this it's not the technology the issue is traceability because if people can trace guns they can trace the people who fired the guns and killed people say in a school shooting only sometimes can they do that well one time is better than never being able to do these kinds of guns look you know we went through the issue of plastic guns in this country thirty years ago the Glock was a call the plastic undetectable gun and it turned out to be a bunch of hooey and sooner or later technology will find a way when you talk about going through airport security while it's true that a polymer won't set off the magnetometer it certainly will be seen by the x-ray machine so it's it's not all one way or the other and we'll come up with a way to detect them we always do we always will this is the in effect Ian a plastic interpretation of and I'm not being cynical or light-hearted about this it's like a plastic interpretation of the Bond movie the man with the Golden Gun you print it you make it you load it then you take it into bits you scatter it through your luggage potentially you reassemble it say that's the Frankenstein scenario you reassemble it on board a plane and then you do your worst on board a plane have I got that right or wrong well generally speaking would have to be metal to be piercing otherwise you're just gonna have plastic bullets but yes the the theory the theoretical elements of that is you could sneak it through but I think this goes a very a wider point about the exportation of this virulent ideology of the righteousness of the Second Amendment in America now I will leave it to Americans to discuss the rights and wrongs of the Second Amendment but as a European I don't want that ideology to be producing technology that there are threatens the safety and security of citizens outside the United States now the Second Amendment has already seen a huge amount of guns going south to Mexico going north to Canada the Second Amendment has led to foreign policy by the United States sending over a million guns to Iraq and Afghanistan in terms of their let's let's export democracy down the barrel of a gun and yet again what we have now is less than a year after the Las Vegas Massacre America loosening not tightening gun laws and you know what Europe looks on slack-jawed a very few groups of people in Europe think this is a good idea the majority thinks why would you want to print on the 3d gun anyway and that could to the fact we've had so many terrorist attacks in the in Europe in recent years it will be terrorists arming themselves in the future of these things become viable it will not be citizens citizens in Europe do not do that they terrorists will do whatever they can to try to kill richard Feldman Ian's got a point there surely your freedoms as enshrined in your Constitution do not and should never be built on your right to kill someone else with either a gun that you've bought at some NRA comic-con type get together or that you've printed off in the basement well that all depends on what you're using the gun for if it's a self-defense shooting I might very well be using a gun to kill someone coming at me with a knife but if I'm the aggressor clearly I'm in the wrong it's not the gun that's the issue the issue in America and everywhere else in the world is never the gun per se but always in whose hands are the guns and for what purpose they're being used and if we focused a little more attention in the media on that aspect of the problem and less on the particular gun being used how it was manufactured for what purpose it was made we'd be going a lot further and having a safer world okay very very very briefly Richard because we are running out of time you're talking there about guns being used to stop bad people in effect whether they are armed or not I do want to have I don't have the gun discussion again but the reality is in the United States of America you are three times more likely to lose your life to gun crime than anyplace else on the planet and also picking up on what Ian Overton involves in Greece was saying you know Scotland for example the UK has very strict handgun legislation that was put on the statute books after the dunblane massacre when a lot of school kids were killed yes I was there yes so you were saying you know if you go to places where guns aren't available it's not surprising that guns aren't misused they're not used they're not misused if you go you know if you live in a landlocked country very few people die in the oceans in landlocked countries because there's no water of course if you go to a country where there are lots of guns and by the way Brazil has a higher violent crime rate with guns than the United States of America does incidentally but the the issue you're conflating different parts of this problem it's not the number of guns it's who's using them and for what purpose if they don't exist no one can use them or misuse them that's obvious but they do exist they are out there and governments all over the world have guns and they're stolen often by from the government they are in the United States the police lose a lot of guns in this country okay tremendous amount of theft I'm going to interrupt you there because the clock is ticking Paul Barrett in New York bring us back to the focus of our discussion please Paul what happens in say the United States when one person loses their lives to either being shot by a 3d printed gun or perhaps the person who's printed it loses their life because something goes wrong with the weapon I think that would accelerate action on Capitol Hill to ban 3d printed guns altogether if there were a high-visibility case like that Ian Overton in Greece last word to you same question to you what happens when this goes wrong say there's another Sandy Hook school shooting and one child has lost its life because as well as being tooled up with all the usual semi-automatic weaponry the killer has a plastic gun that say was put into the school ahead of time and that killer knew where to get it well speaking from Greece I think it might be apt to bring back to the tale of Pandora who put all of the sins in the world into one box and hoped it would never be open but it was opened and the sinners were left free and I think this is what happened the revolution will not be televised it will be downloaded if the 3d printed Garden becomes ubiquitous if 3d printers become ubiquitous we do not know where technology will end I could have told you a year ago that somebody would be run over by a self-driving car and I will tell you that somebody will be shot by a 3d printed gun and that is the responsibility of the United States with a love affair for the Second Amendment not a European love affair for guns not Lobel love affair for guns but an American love affair for guns that has become toxic and poisonous gentlemen we have to leave it there thank you very much for your company thanks to I guess they were Paul Barrett in New York Ian Overton joined us from balos in Greece and in Washington we were joined by Richard Feldman and thank you to you two for your company you can see the show again any time via the website al-jazeera comm
