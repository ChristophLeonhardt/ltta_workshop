and then the insanity that is attended Black Panthers it's crazy I'll see the movie this weekend I hope that it's good timing to spend money on it so anything I spend money on I hope is good but you know I will give you an honest review of that I know that's been forbidden by the media there's actually a law that you're not allowed to give your opinion on black panther emily lock dibala i think summarizes the the feelings of a bunch of insane leftist white social justice warriors she tweeted this out yesterday and it's totally crazy she tweeted out quote so I carefully did not buy Black Panther tickets for opening weekend because I did not want to be the white person sucking black joy out of the theater what's the appropriate date for me to buy tickets is next weekend okay I think the appropriate thing for Emily Locke de Walla to do is never to leave her home again or tweet I think these would be because honestly you never know when you're gonna offend someone just by your very presence like the necklace that she's wearing here I think it's ugly and it's it's ruining my white person joy today wait what kind of insanity is what does she think of black people like how how derogatory do you have to think of black people to think that if you're in a theater with a bunch of black people they're gonna think that white person sitting here in a theater watching a movie talk about how black people are awesome that's ruining my black joy first of all what is black joy and why is black joy different from white joy or different from OMA and joy for that matter I'm just I'm confused well what what what are we even talking about here but the sensitivity police have gone so far that we now have to have fully segregated theaters to make sure that black people are not offended by the presence of white people according to Emily Locke to Walla now we actually have to segregate the theaters it's amazing I mean we could do the converse we could do the cut we did the converse for a couple hundred years in this country right the converse was black people won't be allowed into white people theaters because that will offend the white people and ruin their white joy this is stupid folks
