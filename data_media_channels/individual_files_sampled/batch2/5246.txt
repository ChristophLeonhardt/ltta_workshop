we have to harden your school's nuts offer them up a gun-free zone to a killer or somebody that wants to be a killer that's like going in for the ice cream that's like Here I am technically we have to get smart on gun-free zones when they see it says this is a gun-free zone that means that nobody has a gun except them nobody's going to be shooting bullets in the other direction president today at his second listening session in as many days on guns and school shootings this one involving state and local types he teed up this morning with a series of tweets offering solutions to stop school attacks while also defending the National Rifle Association called them Patriots by the way the NRA endorsed him during the 2016 campaign at today's White House meeting the president talked again about having teachers carry concealed weapons I think a concealed permit for having teachers and letting people know that there are people in the building with gun you won't have in my opinion you want to have these shootings because these people are cowards they're not going to walk into a school if 20% of the teachers have guns it may be 10 percent or maybe 40 percent and what I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry we give them a bonus the president has also said he supports tougher background checks and the idea of keeping weapons like the ar-15 used in the parkland Florida shooting out of the hands of anyone under 21 but here's what he said when our NBC News colleague Hallie Jackson pressed about just how much he supports age restrictions I don't think I'll be going up against them I really think the NRA wants to do what's right I mean they're very close to me I'm very close to them they're very very great people they love this country today we also heard from the NRA including a speech by the head of the organization Wayne LaPierre appeared at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference where he made his first public remarks since last Wednesday's shooting we were all horrified by another terrible tragedy at an American school each and every member of the National Rifle Association mourns the loss of the innocent and continues to keep their families and that community in our prayers we share a goal of safe schools safe neighborhoods and a safe country as usual the opportunist wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain the elites don't care not one whit about America's school system and schooled children they want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of school security the failure of family the failure of America's mental health system and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI evil walks among us and God help us if we don't harden our schools and protect our kids earlier in the session and coming off her appearance at last night's emotional Florida townhall NRA spokesman Dana lash who said this about the press many in legacy media love mass shootings you guys have loved it now I'm not saying that you love the tragedy but I am saying that you love the ratings crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back it is still an open question what happens with Donald Trump the NRA and gun legislation Ashley Parker of the Washington Post tonight reports the president is quote insisting that he be seen as spurring action and at times seeming reactive rather than deliberative spurred on in part by what he sees as an opportunity to fix a problem that former President Barack Obama and others proved unable to solve and on a day in which the president proposed arming school teachers we are learning that an armed security officer a deputy assigned to Margery Stoneham Douglass High School was there with his gun but failed to enter the school when the shooting was taking place what I saw was a deputy arrived at the west side of building 12 take up a position and he never went in went in addressed the killer killed the killers sheriff there was talking about security of his security video he was just able to review with us tonight the aforementioned Ashley Parker White House reporter for The Washington Post and Jackie Calmes White House editor for the Los Angeles Times Ashley Ashley two questions one kind of rhetorical remind us of how Barack Obama is guilty for not doing or saying enough after Newtown and number two this is not an issue this president wakes up in the morning knowing about he doesn't have the usual institutional knowledge of the contours of an issue he tends to land in an issue as is the case with this that's exactly right on your second question this is a president who was born in Queens and spent most of his adult life in man and as his own aides pointed at us he he doesn't come from a gun culture and part of that you saw today and over this past week as he would sort of float general ideas but offer no specifics or say well maybe Congress should do something so he's sort of put himself in the center of this debate but without exactly knowing where the exact fault lines were and the specifics of the policy that said he has an incredibly fine-tuned antenna for where the gun issue and we're sort of Second Amendment rights are culturally and out in the country and that's particularly true in large swaths of the country that voted for him and so he does have that intuitive sense as he does on a number of issues that while he may not know the policy he knows where his base stands and he feels he has maybe a little wiggle room but he can't necessarily go too far Jackie two-part question for you as well does does the president have the stomach to go up against the NRA in any way and after the public shaming of someone like Rubio do these students have the power to keep diminishing the NRA well in terms of the president you know he said I was struck in his roundtables in the last two days that were televised extraordinary you know to watch the president sort of off-the-cuff trying to make policy and he said I it was a very striking parallel to me to what he did just recently some weeks back in the subject of immigration and relief for the young immigrants who came here as children and the daca children deferred action for childhood arrivals in that same way he had one of these extraordinary hour-long televised events where he spoke in a bipartisan conciliatory way he said he would stand up to the to both sides he would provide cover for Republicans to take a hard vote and that might make the Republican base angry and then he himself heard from that base and and hardened his position on immigration and then made demands of the Democrats and some Republicans that they balked at and then we saw nothing happened on immigration in Dhaka and he blamed it on the Democrats I sort of see the same thing playing out here where he said he would stand up he said today that the he's told the NRA that they're going to have to bend that some of these laws have been toughen I really you know there was no sign at the CPAC event and you played Dana lashes and Wayne LaPierre comments there was no sign of conciliation or compromise there at all and I and they said they stand by their position that they are against raising the minimum wage the president said they wouldn't block it but I don't think many people think the president will will go up against them as for the students this is a new factor we I don't think any of us know yet how that's going to play out but you know those of us yourself included who have watched these debates before can't help but be skeptical hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click
