the things that I hate James called me has now emerged to explain that everyone should vote Democrat so the guy who probably lost Hillary Clinton the election hilariously enough now says everyone should vote Democrat to undo his big boo-boo which was completely botching both the Hillary Clinton investigation and the Russian investigation here at Comey tweeted out this Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the founders design that ambition must counteract ambition all who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall policy differences don't matter right now history has its eyes on us the self-aggrandizing nature of this douche is just insane history has it tight he's always tweeting stuff like this history has its eyes on us history had its eyes on you when you decided not only to watch the original Hillary investigation then Reebok right before the election and then to stay around for Donald Trump's administration rather than quitting out of pique supposedly and then you decided not to tell the truth about the investigation publicly and then channels from fired your ass and now you're saying history has its eyes on us worst FBI director in modern history I mean really just an awful awful FBI director and and James Comey suggesting that the Republicans must be thrown out of Congress the Democrats can come in and check Trump I'm wondering how Trump hasn't actually been checked really like in terms of policy where it's Trump and unchecked I would say one area and that really is tariffs but otherwise has the model investigation been shut down no is that investigation continuing sure does Trump say what he wants yeah but guess what so did Obama the idea the Democrats are gonna check Trump in any serious way other than passing a bunch of bad legislation I think it is foolhardy you think you can trust Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer listen I understand the tendency for Americans to like split government because they like the gridlock I get it but James Comey suggesting that ambition must counteract ambition Republicans aren't doing it so now we have to let Democrats is just it's it's so silly that even Brian Fallon former Hillary Clinton campaigner he came out he said basically to call me we don't want your help you're an idiot and so there's that
