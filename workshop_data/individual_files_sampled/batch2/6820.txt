some businesses in San Francisco have begun using security robots in order to fend off the poor San Francisco does have a pretty significant homeless problem and they are arguing that the homelessness is leading to crime and Vandelay ssin vandalism vandalism and so one nonprofit started utilizing one of these robot security guards Monday said are you deleting it butylated alright so one such bot cop recently took over the outside of the San Francisco SPCA and animal advocacy and pet adoption clinic in the city's Mission District and it was all to deter homeless people from hanging out there now the SPCA was arguing that look the homeless people were threatening some of our employees the vandalism was out of hand and so we decided to use this robot that apparently deters some of the crime the nightscope bots are equipped with four cameras able to read more than 300 license plates per minute they can move about and keep tabs on an area noting anyone on a list of those who shouldn't be there all right so you must be wondering alright Lee what does the robot do does it like shoot lasers at people well it doesn't really do anything other than provide a dominating force and also just monitor what's going on take a look think of it like a mark patrol car on the side of the street these are not there to intervene with anything being done there they're actually to provide a commanding presence to actually have something there similar to the patrol car the side street everybody sees that and they immediately say okay I need to behave so it's not about having a human presence necessarily it's just about having an authoritative presence I know they have cameras in them but you could also just place cameras I mean they're already cameras in the mall so what what else does this robot do well going back to when I was a police officer one of the first things they teach you is you have to have a use-of-force okay and that first use of force is the commanding presence so what a camera that is mounted up on top of the building does is absolutely no presence okay so the SPCA got so much pushback because of the fact that they were utilizing these robots that they decided to stop using them the city also is starting to get involved because more and more people are apparently employing these robots and now you need to take permits out in order to have one in front of your business or to use one on a sidewalk so maybe they didn't like the permit process but either way these robots cost about $6 an hour versus the 16 dollars an hour that they'd have to pay a person to be a security guard so there's that component of it as well why did they make the robots look like Klan members well the the co-founder hold on the co-founder that we just heard from was arguing that the they intentionally made the robots look like that because people think it's cute yeah because if I saw one of those I wouldn't run out take a selfie I would I would run that looks terrifying it looks like the egg that Robin Williams came out of in Mork and Mindy yeah it made me disappointed though cuz I was like these do not look like the robots and iRobot like I wanted them to be a commanding force like yeah it's still I don't know it's still terrified me I guess I'm the demographic that okay but now let me make my serious points how about we deal with homelessness instead of like you know building the moats and employing robots to fend them away look the story we didn't get to earlier this week was about one of the wildfires in California the one that actually threatened you know the area that I live in it was the bel-air fire I don't live in bel-air okay but I live in the less you know affluent part near it anyway but either way the reason why that fire started is because there was a homeless encampment near by and and homeless people were cooking food with an in flame and barrel fires are becoming common here in Los Angeles because homelessness has gotten out of control and so again you can build your moats you can try to you know do what you want to do to try to get homeless people away from you it's not gonna work things are getting really bad we need to actually deal with the root of the problem yeah so so sorry sorry look the robots are the beginning and so right now like they're not they're not like Anna said they're not shooting lasers out they're not bumping into the homeless people until they leave right and and so I get that the cameras there and the rotating head is gonna scare off some people who might want to break in right I understand that but but once you've deployed your army of robots what's next absolutely right and and so if you are prevent a crime I get that right but at the same time if you want to fend off the homeless as a different thing now you've sent nonhumans to attack humans in a sense in a sense right and then that's the first step it won't be the last step and so this isn't right I mean look I'm not naive I'm not one of those liberals who are like oh the homeless are all angels and you should go hug one of them no it looks they some I'm serious mental issues and sometimes violence happens and etc so I get it I get it but at the same time the answer isn't have them all over the streets or crush them it's gotta be a better answer than that and we can't just send our robots after them it's we've got to have a comprehensive strategy and obviously San Francisco isn't doing it right because we don't that level of problem does not exist in other cities it's starting to exist everywhere at higher and higher levels by the way one of the issues is income inequality because they're not they don't all have mental issues so I'm just can't oh look I was so no just Democrat running for Congress yesterday Cory bush for while while she was going to school she had to live out of her car right and so that's the reality and that's beginning to happen because we've been crushed too much and robots are definitely not the answer well I'm big on intersections and I think that the gay community in San Francisco that has a great voice really should speak up for the homeless people you talked about it earlier what what person that is schizophrenic or that is suffering from it in a deep state of mania it's gonna run from that robot like what effectiveness we really have to deal with the real issues the real issues with homelessness a lot of people are mentally ill we keep ignoring mentally ill people because we keep trying to sweep this under the rug it's really a big issue all of us will be affected by it at some point I I was homeless I feel like every time I come here I've been belonged to every tragic group that's I've had a really rough life but that's why I'm a comedian so I can make jokes about it but I was homeless and I mean you're already at the bottom like I tell you I was homeless with two children already at the bottom so you're gonna shoo me away with a robot that you could have used the money to make that robot to help feed some of the home maybe give you a job so you're not homeless yes I would be the security guard wouldn't mean a robot I would have taken six dollars an hour cuz I was homeless yeah all right by the way check out the video of TechCrunch either in the description box where there's a link or in the corner if you move your
