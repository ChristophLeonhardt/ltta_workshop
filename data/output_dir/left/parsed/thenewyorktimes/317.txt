“This guy has got to
be the toughest guy
to take the kind of
abuse that he’s taking.”
“I have no idea who
these women are.”
“They said nothing happened.
Everybody said nothing happened.”
Well before the #MeToo movement
gained momentum,
Donald Trump weighed in
on allegations
against several well-known men,
including himself.
A look at his past
statements show a man
who’s quick to defend
other men.
“He says he’s innocent.
And I think you have to
remember that.”
The president recently vouched
for Rob Porter,
a White House aide
who is accused
of physical and verbal abuse
by two ex-wives.
Porter denies the allegations.
Trump also defended Roy Moore,
the former Republican
Alabama Senate candidate.
Moore is accused of
sexual misconduct
against teenage girls.
“Well, he denies it.
Look, he denies it.
I mean, if you look at
what is really going on,
and you look at all the things
that have happened
over the last 48 hours,
he totally denies it.”
President Trump then
campaigned for Moore.
“So get out and
vote for Roy Moore.”
Five women received settlements
after making harassment claims
against Fox News
host Bill O’Reilly.
He was later forced
off the network.
O’Reilly denied the allegations.
This is what the president said.
“‘He’s a person I know well — he’s
a good person,’ adding,
‘I think he shouldn’t have settled.
I don’t think Bill
did anything wrong.’”
In 2016, a reporter accused
Trump’s former campaign manager
Corey Lewandowski
of grabbing and bruising
her arm at a campaign rally.
“A lot of people are
looking and saying,
how can anybody be charged?
He was — she was actually —
if you look at her,
my look at, and according to
a lot of —
she’s grabbing at me, 
and he’s acting as an intermediary
and trying to block
her from doing that.”
There have been moments when
Trump has come out against
men accused of sexual misconduct.
But it’s typically only happened
when they’re political rivals.
The president slammed
former Senator Al Franken,
a Democrat, after a photo
surfaced of him appearing
to grope a woman.
“The Al Frankenstein picture is really bad,
speaks a thousand words.
Where do his hands
go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 ...”
Trump also criticized
Harvey Weinstein,
a major Democratic Party donor,
after allegations that he
engaged in rampant sexual
harassment and abuse.
“I’ve known Harvey Weinstein for a long time.
I’m not at all surprised to see it.”
And then there’s
the president, who has been
accused of sexual
misconduct by multiple women.
Like many of the
men he defends,
Trump denies the allegations.
“Every woman lied when they
came forward to hurt my campaign.
Total fabrication.
The events never happened.
Never.”
