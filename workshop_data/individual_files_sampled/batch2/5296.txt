welcome back as we said the reason I'm here is to meet the midterms and we're coming to you live from Dallas so joining me now are a couple of Texas political experts it's Julie fine political reporter at NBC 5 Dallas Fort Worth our affiliate here in in the DFW and Abby Livingston Washington bureau chief at the Texas Tribune Ruth Marcus and Matthew Continent are gonna stick around for me in Washington have a little national in Texas although in Texas the National is Texas right we're very important we're very important as everybody in Texas likes to remind me so Julian let me just start let's start with Texas you heard senator Cruz there was that a confident senator Cruz is that a is that a is that a is that a guy that feels like he's gonna get get reelected or does he feel a real race I think that senator Cruz whether he's confident or not is always gonna run like the underdog he has said that all along he said you know he's basically said you can't take anything for granted and I think he's running a very very strong hard race right now he's doing two three events a day that's you know a page out of pedos book fedo has been traveling federal work has been traveling all through Texas for a long time now Ted Cruz has a bus tour he is not running like he feels overconfident but you do have to remember I mean right now polls show him ahead five six nine points so Abby Livingston if ten years ago I don't think we would expected a Republican incumbent senator to be doing bus trips across the state in October so things have changed things have changed and I think it wasn't even ten years ago I think it was two years ago I think Donald Trump has just reset the politics of the state of Texas just like everywhere else with the Rust Belt we saw the rural areas come out 2016 and revolt in favor of the Republicans and in 2016 in Texas we saw the cities come out and go democratic and so this is a new terrain for anyone following Texas politics alright so what does this mean for Benjamin is this it you know there's this he seems you know the joke is he's a bigger national following than a Texas following but judging what I've been here he's got a big Texas following too representative or work has a very big Texas following but what representative of work needs independent voters he needs some Republican voters and he certainly needs the new voters so the question for him really will be turnout and how many people he can get out to vote and how many of those new voters he can get in his direction because Texas as you know is a very red state it's a very conservative state so he's really got to have some crossover appeal is this though how are their swing voters or it's just a margin race meaning it's all about running up the margins where where he's gonna be strong and hope they can tamp down the turnout where Cruz is gonna be strong I think to an extent I spoke to some voters in Fort Worth my hometown and some of them were not normal midterm voters these are either people who don't vote or vote in the presidential and so he has gotten them to come to the polls for the first time at the same time this has made Republican voters very nervous and they are starting to react to this by voting themselves so it is anyone's guess who is turning out between now and Election Day here's something that is the fuddled me watching the overall campaign and I'm curious about what you to say about this every other red state Democrat Kyrsten Sinema the Democratic nominee in Arizona Phil Bredesen the Democratic nominee in Tennessee Joe Manchin the incumbent senator in West Virginia Heidi all of them are tacking to the middle and hugging the middle almost running away from the left wing of the party bet toe isn't which I think is what makes them so popular with progressives they like oh look he's willing to do that in a red state is that politically smart or not well I think what he has always said throughout this campaign is that he is going to be true to who he is so at this point even if he wanted to go a little bit more towards the middle to get to that independent voter he really can't do that this is who he says he is and he has stuck through it through the campaign will it hurt him with the independent voter it could it depends how far left they're willing to go or if they're a one-issue voter or not and Abbie I'm willing to recalibrate my own thinking I'm watching Florida and you know I would have said no Andrew Gilliam was going to not be a strong statewide candidate he's turned into a very strong to a white candidate so maybe things have changed what is going on is Cruz probably has a stable lead according to all of these polls but it comes back to we are seeing strange things we see enthusiasm that is hard for polling to detect all over the state of Texas maybe the polls are right maybe they are not I think the biggest miscalculation for anyone in my position is to like convey some sort of certainty about this race it is the wildest thing I've ever seen in Texas politics and I've lived here or I've been a part of Texas for a very long time hello youtubers if you're watching this it
