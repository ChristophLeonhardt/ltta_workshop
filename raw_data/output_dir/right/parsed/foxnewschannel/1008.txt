>> Martha: DEVELOPING TONIGHT,
IT APPEARS THAT
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IS BACK
ON THE SCENE.
THE FORMER PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY
HAVING SORT OF SECRET MEETINGS,
PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT OF HIS
BUILDING WHERE HIS OFFICE IS
NOW, TALKING TO FOLKS WHO MIGHT
BE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS,
GIVING SOME ADVICE, SOME
GUIDANCE PERHAPS.
THOUGHTS IN THE FUTURE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
HE HAS MET WITH AT LEAST NINE
POTENTIAL CANDIDATES SO FAR,
INCLUDING MAJOR NAMES LIKE
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN,
SENATORS BERNIE SANDERS AND
ELIZABETH WARREN AND FORMER
MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR DEVAL
PATRICK.
HERE NOW, CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR, AND JUAN WILLIAMS,
COHOST OF THE "THE FIVE."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
JUAN, LET ME START WITH YOU.
WHAT YOU THINK THIS TELLS US
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE
FORMER PRESIDENT AND ALL OF
THIS?
>> I THINK IN A SENSE HE'S
COMING OUT OF HIDING NOW THAT
OBAMA PEOPLE SAY OF COURSE HE'S
TALKING TO FELLOW DEMOCRATS, BUT
THE WAY THE NEWS WAS SPREAD
TODAY IS THAT THESE ARE
POTENTIALLY THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD
BE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S
NOMINEE IN 2020.
I THINK THE KEY HERE IS THAT
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT IS OPERATING
IN THAT WAY, BUT HE DOESN'T
WANTED TO BE THE CASE THAT
PEOPLE PERCEIVE THAT THE
ESTABLISHMENT, THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY ESTABLISHMENT IS PICKING
THE CANDIDATE.
THAT HASN'T WORKED FOR THEM IN
THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES THIS
YEAR LEADING UP TO THE MIDTERMS
AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A HEAVY
HAND.
THEY PICKED HILLARY CLINTON LAST
TIME.
>> Martha: IS UNDERSTANDABLE
THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WOULD
WANT TO HAVE THESE MEETINGS SORT
OF OFF THE RADAR.
I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK OF ALL
THE PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT OF
TRUMP TOWER AND HOW DIFFERENT
THESE TWO MEN ARE.
NOT THAT THE SITUATIONS ARE
SIMILAR, BUT EVERYBODY REMEMBER
THOSE MOMENTS, THE VIDEO.
EVERYBODY WALKING IN AND OUT OF
THE BUILDING AND THERE WERE
CAMERAS SET UP EVERYWHERE.
VERY DIFFERENT MEN AND HOW THEY
GO ABOUT THEIR POLITICS.
>> INDEED.
TRUMP LIKES A SHOW.
HE LIKES TO DRIED OUT, HE LIKES
THE LIGHTS.
THEY COULD NOT BE MORE
DIFFERENT.
BUT WITH BARACK OBAMA, WE HAVE
SEEN HIS INVOLVEMENT IN PARTISAN
POLITICS SINCE HE LEFT OFFICE.
WHETHER HE'S WEIGHING IN ON
OBAMACARE OR OTHER POLICY
THINGS, BUT IS    AS JUAN SAID,I
THINGS, BUT IS    AS JUAN SAID,T
SHOULD BE ALL THAT SURPRISING
CONSIDERING THE PRESIDENT IS
SITTING THERE WATCHING SO MUCH
OF HIS AGENDA TORN OUT ROOT AND
BRANCH BY THIS PRESIDENT.
A LOT OF IT IS EASILY DONE BY
WHATEVER IT WAS, THE PEN AND THE
PHONE, BECAUSE OF OBAMA'S AGENDA
WAS PUT IN BY A PEN AND A PHONE.
>> Martha: UNFORTUNATELY
THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT PRESIDENT
HAVE TO WORK THESE DAYS.
THEY HAVE A TOUGH TIME GETTING
THROUGH A LOT OF MAJOR
LEGISLATION.
I WANT TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE
PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN THERE.
TERRY McAULIFFE, KRISTEN SHALL
A MAN, KEMAL HARRIS.
CORY BOOKER HASN'T VISITED THE
OFFER SINCE LAST YEAR.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS
SIGNIFICANT OR NOT, BUT DOES
THIS TELL ANYTHING ABOUT WHO THE
PRESIDENT PREFERS?
>> IT'S KIND OF EARLY.
I THINK WE'RE STILL TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW
SIGNIFICANT IT IS THAT HE'S
TALKING TO ALL THESE FOLKS.
MANY ARE CONTENDERS BUT THE ONE
THING THAT STANDS OUT TO ME, IF
YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT WHO IS
THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY AT THIS MOMENT AND LOTS OF
PEOPLE, SAYING THERE IS NO
LEADERSHIP, THERE'S AN AN
ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP.
GUESS WHAT, IT'S NOT
NANCY PELOSI, IT'S NOT
CHUCK SCHUMER.
HERE WE HAVE BARACK OBAMA
ASSERTING HIMSELF AS THE MAN WHO
IS FIGHTING REPUBLICAN
GERRYMANDERING, FIGHTING VOTER
REGISTRATION AND NOW POTENTIALLY
ASSERTING HIMSELF AS THE MAN WHO
WILL SELECT THE PARTY'S NOMINEE.
>> Martha: THERE'S NO DOUBT
THAT HIS SUPPORT WILL BE HUGE
FOR WHOEVER ULTIMATELY GETS IT.
BILL CLINTON IS LOOKING LIKE HE
IS JUST DISAPPEARING FROM THE
SCENE AND COMMENTS LIKE THIS ARE
NOT GOING TO HELP HIM.
>> I THINK THE NORMS HAVE REALLY
CHANGED IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CAN
DO TO SOMEBODY AGAINST THEIR
WILL, HOW MUCH YOU CAN CROWD
THEIR SPACE, MAKE THEM
MISERABLE.
>> WOW.
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S SO GOOD.
>> Martha: HE SAID IT SEVERAL
DAYS AGO.
I HADN'T SEEN THAT UNTIL THIS
MORNING, BUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO
TO SOMEBODY AGAINST THEIR WILL,
JUAN?
>> SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO ANYBODY
AGAINST THEIR WILL.
THERE'S NO CHANGE OVER TIME OR
STANDARDS, THAT'S JUST WRONG.
>> Martha: QUICK FUN AND WE'VE
GOT TO GO.
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF
BEHAVIOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE, IN
THE OVAL OFFICE THAT A LOT OF
QUENTIN'S DETRACTORS DEPLORED
ABOUT HIM AT THE TIME.
