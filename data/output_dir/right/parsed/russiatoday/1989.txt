one of the things which betrays genuine
Russian troll factory accounts is the
language look for an inability to use
the an a Russian is one of the languages
which doesn't happen
what kind of anti-immigrant creativity
I'm a political refugee came to the US
when I was nine and I still sometimes
use their own article I and just about
every other immigrant I know have been
booed and shamed because of our
imperfect English
there are many Twitter users who avoid
use of definite and indefinite articles
to stay within the character limit
twitter does not always land itself to
good syntax
interesting does that mean most US
citizens are Russian trolls since plenty
of them can't even for macragge to a
complete sentence
you
