for seeing his work I was mesmerised and blown away I've never seen any artists work with paper as he did looking at here is Michelangelo's David he was initially inspired to do this piece because when he was younger he was actually taught by professors to look at these classical busts to initially start as a draftsman so this is what he used and these are his still tools of study hence the name of the show there are thousands of sheets of paper put together to form various figures in the sculpture Department at CAF of essential Academy of Fine Arts these students are given these these busts to copy as a project so they're plaster busts that they're given in school his take on it was to copy them in his unique method there are years of work and trial and error he's come up with all the works that you see currently on display in the gallery it's a relatively heavy piece so you've read it's like coal muscles on your face that's already working pretty much everything you see in the main gallery space has been sold the most expensive piece in this room is the sculpture was the sculpture of David it's an addition of two if they both sold for 30 $2,500 each
