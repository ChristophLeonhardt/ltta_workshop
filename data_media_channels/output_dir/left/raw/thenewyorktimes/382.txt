1
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:33,191
I was seven years old 
and we had driven overnight.

2
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:34,651
I had no idea 
what to expect

3
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,791
and it was really boring 
for a long time.

4
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,341
But then all of a sudden 
you're plunged into darkness

5
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:42,021
and you see 
the corona come out

6
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,891
and it's just, 
it's like nothing else

7
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,241
on earth. 
And I was just hooked.

8
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,906
This is just a 
tremendous opportunity

9
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:03,106
for scientific research. 
We're learning

10
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:06,686
not only how the sun shines 
but since the sun

11
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:10,076
is an example 
of a certain type of star

12
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:11,966
–that is widespread 
in the universe–

13
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,636
we're learning 
about billions

14
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,396
and trillions 
of other stars.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,060
The eclipses 
are all different

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,950
because they're in
different places,

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,500
different times 
every year.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,490
So at Svalbard in March, 
for instance,

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,210
was frostbitten feet 
and marching up

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,070
for polar bears, 
but totality itself,

21
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,920
assuming you're not 
clouded out,

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,860
it's just an 
overwhelming,

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,140
powerful experience
no matter where.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,200
It's short, 
it's powerful.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:00:00,000
Just put down 
the camera and enjoy.
