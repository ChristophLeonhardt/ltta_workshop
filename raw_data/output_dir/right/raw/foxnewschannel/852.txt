>> MY DAD TAUGHT ME TO BE A

86
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:00,706
PATRIOT.

87
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:03,809
HE USED TO DRAG US AROUND TO THE

MY DAD IS RAISING ME TO BE A

92
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:10,782
PROUD AMERICAN OR MAYBE HE WAS

93
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,451
TRYING TO FILL THE AFTERNOON

94
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,185

IT'S BORING TO WATCH.

121
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,766
