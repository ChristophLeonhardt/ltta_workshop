but our top story is the closing circle of legal pressure on Donald Trump from key witnesses taking the stand in the mana for trial to news from Trump's legal tormentor Michael avenatti he popped back up to discuss the DVD he has long used to taunt the president without disclosing its contents now he is doing some breaking news of his own on who is in possession of it you have anything else you can tell me about this DVD as soon as we get it back from law enforcement I'll be happy to talk about it that is new the assertion that law enforcement are sufficiently interested in this DVD to collect it as evidence now we do not know and this is important if avenatti is alleging there that it's in the possession of federal law enforcement which could mean molar or Cohen prosecutors in New York or whether it is some other local case which quite frankly could be far less important meanwhile the other news tonight is that Muller has completed interviews with another new Roger stone associate her name is Kristen Davis now Stone says tonight that she knows nothing about alleged Russian collusion WikiLeaks collaboration or any other impropriety related to the 2016 election today also marks the end of the first week of the first case that Bob Muller has ever taken to trial which is kind of significant when you think about it Muller putting his first cooperating witness on the stand against yes former Trump campaign chair Paul Mann afford and the accountant who worked with man afford and now today provided more evidence of alleged fraud to this jury that will decide manna for its fate prosecutors also say they're gonna put their star witness on the stand who everyone has been gossiping about that's Manta Ford's former deputy Rick gates so he will be on the stand soon and that's the first time America will hear from any Trump aide publicly implicating another Trump aide now mana forts attorneys not only throwing the blame onto all of this the right-hand man they're trying to reverse what the culpability is and also say that Paul mana for who has sold his services to many people around the world as an expert they're going to argue effectively Paul Manafort just didn't know any better and was in over his head I'm joined now on set by California Congressman ted Lieu who is of course a member of the Judiciary Committee Stephanie Miller a radio talk show host and a political analysts as well as Che commander II who has worked for the Clinton and Obama campaigns congressman this is a lot swirling around what do you read in the tea leaves from the man-of-war trial and how do you think the White House is handling it because you and your colleagues have said some of the way the president's responded this week adds to the obstruction case against him that's correct Ari and thanks for your question the walls are closing in on the president not only you have a man or child going on you've got Cohen with the tape and him potentially flipping you also have a separate state investigation into the Trump Foundation which could lead to criminal tax fraud issues so that's why we're seeing an increasing number of angry tweets by the President and when he bravely goes out and tells his Attorney General to shut down the mole investigation that's obstruction of justice and just because he doesn't a full public view doesn't mean it's not obstruction do you have any view as to why he did it that way there's a theory that we've been reporting on that it looks incriminating which is why even his own lawyers denied what it was oh this wasn't an order when he said should stop now but does he maybe know what Muller has and he's trying to sort of launder it and and desensitize people to it by just doubling down on what any other president would see as obstruction what Nixon said in private was not as bad as this I think the president just doesn't care what the law is I think to him it doesn't matter if he publicly obstructs justice and we saw this happen when he fired James Comey then went on TV a few days later and said the one thing his attorneys would have told him never to say right what does he fire call me because of russia' investigation I think the president just does not care and that's why we need to hold him accountable flip the house in November take home and Dorrie the congressman mentions the widening pressure and the truck organization issues you've said that this is going to be if the Democrats get subpoena power a bigger fight and even what we know now from Donald Trump because he might just be defending his presidency and legacy he will be facing legal pressure on the Trump Organization in his family's future itself what do you mean by that well this is not just a fight for the political future of Donald Trump this is a fight for his own personal future this is not a midterm that we're going into where you know President Obama or President Bush is looking at the passed legislation to advance their policy aims Donald Trump is fighting for his own life he's fighting for his family's business he's fighting for his legal future Rudolph Giuliani interesting enough did say that Robert Muller could indict him after he leaves the presidency he is fighting for Shore and that's legally true yes and he's fighting for his marriage we know from the the Cohen case perhaps that his prenuptial agreement is is going to be in some trouble because because of those revelations so he will be fighting very be Bentley because it's not just his political future that's on the line it's actually Donald Trump personally who's gonna be on the line the Trump brand the Trump business everything that Donald Trump has worked for for 70 years is potentially going to be decided in November because Democrats will gain subpoena power they will gain as they win you're saying yeah they'll gain ability to have hearings they will be able to look at those tax returns look at those financial disclosure statements have hearings into the Trump Russia probe strengthen the Mueller probe as opposed to allowing Trump to shut it down and Stephanie if you want a party like it's 1999 for a second let's talk DVD evidence not not the usual format that everyone's familiar with but Michael avenatti has made a lot of noise about this now they tried to get more details out of him on the view and he did something there that viewers of the beat will recognize which is just random flattery rather than completely providing all the details that journalists want take a look at avenatti on the on the view do they have anything to do with the DVD do they have anything to do with the DVD that's a really good question I know you're a good questioner as your attorney in Ohio so he's only giving so much information there with Behar and sunny Hostin talking to him but what do you think is the significance that we are learning tonight that this avenatti related evidence is in the hand of some authorities well I think the only thing that could be more damning on a DVD is more Rudy Guiliani appearances you think it might be a DVD random flattery you are not just a great attorney you're great on television Rudy Giuliani is neither and I have to ask your opinion legally is he working for Muller is he working for us is he is he on your side yes I mean I'm already a little bit I'm having a moment with ted Lieu and subpoena power that got me a little overly excited can we get a zoom in on ya where you're having a moment you're holding the congressman's hand cars when you can move your hand at any time that you're uncomfortable I think the Rudy Giuliani part goes to the more serious point that the congressman raised which is sometimes where did you allow any muddies everything up whether that's in their interest or not other times though we see Rudy trying to fix the problems that his client creates in other words why is Rudy so messy well he works for a really messy client I actually think what Rudy Giuliani is trying to do is to get in front of the American people with evidence that he knows is bad that's gonna come out anyway right except he executes in a very bad way and he says things that just are not true on national TV then he has to ratchet that back and his client will undercut him so I think what did you are you certain has the right idea he just doesn't do it in the right way we all he for his trap that we're all that he's that's what he's doing he's throwing sand in the UM sighs he's just throwing up as much confusion so we're all talking about that rather than you know the important issues well I mean he's really framing the midterm the key theme of this midterm is gonna be it's gonna be Trump's interests legal and financial versus Americas and Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump are saying choose my interest and not America's okay and congressman I want to play a bit of a fact check that we've put together that shows some of the people who have an oath to the Constitution who serve our national security in their own a somewhat measured and not enough according to what you and others have called for though but in their own way seem to be putting out a flag the Donald Trump is hiding what happened in the Putin meeting which is suspicious that he is wrong about denying Russian attacks and saying they're an ongoing hoax given the intelligence in the midterms and I want your view of that and also what is to be done about it since you're in a co-equal branch of government take a look in Helsinki I had a great meeting with Putin we discussed everything I had a great day we got along really well by the way that's a good thing not in a position to either understand fully or talk about what happened the Helsinki now we're being hindered by the Russian hoax it's a hoax okay we acknowledge the threat it is real it is continuing and we're doing everything we can I'll tell you what Russia's very unhappy that Trump won vatican's huh did you want President Trump to win yes I did of course the final answer from Putin those are a lot of facts had completely undercut the president's claims I served on active duty I never thought I would see the American commander in chief gone a foreign soil and throw America under the bus the way he did and that's why not only that you have Americans react you had his own administration officials who react and yet Dan coats that same day issue a press release that he didn't clear the White House basically saying yeah the russians hacked us in 2016 and they're gonna do this again and you see his own administration pushing back against the president that's actually good for what I believe is the America that I know which is adhering to a law and make sure we stick with the facts you put it starkly and you mention your own service I wonder it to some degree is this a sort of reverse Iraq war situation where you had a political white house putting pressure on the CIA to say the threat from abroad may have been worse than it was to get what they want here as you just referred to you have the people intelligence saying there is a real threat whether or not what we do about it and go to war or cyber war is a bigger question but there is a very real threat that's been documented by all these intelligence agencies and the molar indictments and it's the it's oddly the and the white house putting pressure on them to pretend there isn't a problem isn't a threat that's a very good point but I actually think really it is only Donald Trump that things there is no threat and everybody else around him things that he's talking crazy talk which is why you have his own military officials having to do a whole press conference this week tell the American people yes there's a Russian threat we're trying to take care of it and our frameworks are very smart they also allowed us to have 50 states each with their Secretary of State and whether you're Republican or Democratic Secretary of State you don't want your own elections hacked so we do have a lot of people working on this issue well I think you make an important point I mean you're talking really about federalism and how elections are run in this country and they're pros to cons and pros and cons to that but with regard to election security it's not all as you say run out of the White House maybe this is one of those days where going to the midterms that is one silver lining hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could
