upset about it actually which was weird

90
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,139

96
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,480

100
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,910
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stressful in the sense that</font>

101
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,930
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't involve making</font>

102
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,910
two outfits for mortals who will then

103
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,880
not turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and you have to like fashion</font>

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,620
