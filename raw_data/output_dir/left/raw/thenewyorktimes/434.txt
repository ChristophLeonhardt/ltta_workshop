00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,700
Hey everyone, my name is Lucas Peterson.
I am the Frugal Traveler

2
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,670
for The New York Times. I am in Jerez,
which is part of the Sherry Triangle

3
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,049
in southern Spain, the cities of
Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Jerez

4
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,300
and El Puerto de Santa María.
Within that triangle is where

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,860
sherry has to be made in order
for it to be called sherry.

6
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,390
And I am at the bodega or
wine cellar of Tio Pepe and

7
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,610
I'm going to get a tour.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,540
Manuel María González started
this company in 1835.

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,800
He was very young,
only 23 years old.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,320
And his uncle, Uncle Pepe,
was an expert about wine

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,020
and he helped to start this business.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,380
And you're saying this is the special,
this is the Albariza soil?

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,030
This is Albariza soil, white on the
surface and you can see a little darker

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,579
because of the humidity.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,320
And the grapes are required to
be grown in this kind of soil?

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,330
We have different kinds of soil.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,620
But this is the same as this
is what you're saying.

18
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,760
This is, this one is coming from here.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,310
The only difference is the age.

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:00:00,000
This is coming from here. This is the
starting point of this, 12 years old.
