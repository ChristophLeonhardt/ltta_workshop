STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.
MY NEXT GUEST TRAVELED OVER
27,000 MILES, INTERVIEWED TRUMP
VOTERS IN TEN SWING COUNTIES TO
DISCOVER WHAT WAS BEHIND THE
HISTORIC 2016 ELECTION.
JOINING ME NOW, THE COAUTHORS OF
"THE GREAT REVOLT, RESHAPING
AMERICA POLITICS."
GOOD TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND
THANK YOU FOR THE BOOK.
AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR
DEBATE.
WHAT DID YOU MAINLY LEARN?
>> WELL, ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I LEARNED
IS THAT THIS IS A VERY
ASPIRATIONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE.
AND THEIR INFLUENCE IN OUR
COUNTRY GO WELL BEYOND THE
BALLOT BOX.
SO YOU AREN'T JUST FEELING THE
PRESSURE FROM THEM IN WHO PEOPLE
VOTED FOR IN THE ELECTION IN
2016, BUT ALSO YOU SEE
INFLUENCES IN COMMERCE, IN HOW
WE SPEND OUR MONEY AND HOW WE
WATCH TELEVISION AND HOW WE VIEW
THINGS LIKE SPORTS.
AND THEY'RE A CULTURE AND A
COALITION THAT IS DEMANDING
RESPECT FROM THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE
OF MAIN STREET WHERE THEY LIVE.
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS IS, THIS IS A COALITION
AND A MOVEMENT THAT IS STILL --
WE'RE STILL NOT HEARING WHAT IT
HAS TO SAY.
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS AN
IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER WHEN
WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD, NOT JUST IN
POLITICS, BUT IN EVERYTHING IN
OUR SOCIETY.
STEVE: BRAD, I JUST WANTED TO
ASK YOU WHETHER, WHAT YOU MAKE
OF THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE BEEN
HEARING LATELY THAT ACTUALLY
DESPITE WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ASSUME, THE TRUMP VOTE AND THIS
MOVEMENT WAS DRIVEN, THIS POP
POPULOUS MOVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY
THE ECONOMIC, THAT ACTUALLY IT'S
A LOT ABOUT CULTURE AND WHITE
MEN NOT LIKING THE FACT THAT
WOMEN HAVE JOBS AND MINORITIES
ARE GETTING THEIR SWAY IN THE
CULTURE.
WE'VE SEEN THAT CRITIQUE LATE
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE
ELITES ON THE COAST AND THE
ELITES IN THE MEDIA NOT GETTING
IT.
THEY DIDN'T GET THE OUTCOME THEY
EXPECTED, DIDN'T GET THE OUTCOME
THEY WANTED, SO THEY HAVE TO
ATTACK THE CHARACTER AND THE
MOTIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO
DELIVER THE OUTCOME.
DONALD TRUMP WAS THE CAUSE OF
THIS, HE WAS THE RESULT OF IT.
IT WAS A MOVEMENT THAT HAS BEEN
COMING FOR A LONG TIME AND A
POPULOUS MOVEMENT IMPACTING
OTHER INDUSTRIES.
WE DON'T HAVE SEARS AND ROE RO B
WE DON'T HAVE SEARS AND ROE RO C
WE DON'T HAVE SEARS AND ROE RO ,
WE GO TO AMAZON.
THAT'S THE CORE OF WHAT THIS
MOVEMENT WAS.
STEVE: YOU SAID THERE'S MORE TO
COME FROM THIS MOVEMENT.
EXPLAIN THAT IS AIT
EXPLAIN THAT AS AIT
EXPLAIN THAT A BAIT
EXPLAIN THAT A BITT
EXPLAIN THAT A BIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT IN ?
>> I THINK THIS COALITION STAYS
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE.
BUT AS WE WERE BOTH SAYING, THE
IMPACT IS OUTSIDE OF THE BALLOT
BOX, TOO.
LOOK AT THE RATINGS IN THE NFL,
THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN
DRAMATICALLY.
THEY USED TO HAVE THE BEST
BRANDS IN THE COUNTRY.
NOW THAT BRAND IS WEAKENED.
LOOK AT "ROSE ANNE."
NO ONE IN HOLLYWOOD WOULD HAVE
PREDICTED THAT THAT WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
LOOK AT WHO DROVE THOSE NUMBERS.
IT WASN'T THE NEW YORK MEDIA
MARKET OR THE LOS ANGELES MEDIA
MARKET.
IT WAS TULSA, OKLAHOMA,
CINCINNATI, OHIO, PIRTS PURRING,
PENNSYLVANIA.
NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES DON'T
EVEN MAKE THE TOP 20.
THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THESE PEOPLE
HAVE MORE POWER IN COMMERCE THAN
I THINK THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.
STEVE: THAT'S REALLY
INTERESTING.
BRAD, SELENA, THANKS SO MUCH.
I HOPE WE CAN KEEP TALKING ABOUT
