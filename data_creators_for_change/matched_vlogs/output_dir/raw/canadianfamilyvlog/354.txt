1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
okay here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go I got this tarpey</font>

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,450
greenhouse thing up it's got a door

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,580
there I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting some stuff in it</font>

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,780
thought oh I better do an update before

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,099
filling up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with stuff so it only fits</font>

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,340
these smaller containers and I have a

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,320
bunch of those bigger ones so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking is I was going to put these two</font>

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,380
boards<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put the bigger ones down in</font>

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,060
the middle and then get some more the

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,680
smaller ones to put a role in that

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,539
bottom and I'm on the top I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,929
to use this middle shelf because I don't

14
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it will be enough space because</font>

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,219
the plants are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be in here will</font>

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,129
grow into this space like hot peppers

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,350
and tomatoes stuff like that and I can't

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,420
fill it up completely either because I

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,690
have to level it out like right now this

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,370
grounds to front level so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,590
buy some more of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> boards and then</font>

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,899
level out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edges all the way around</font>

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,050
and then stack the green house on top of

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so it's not really done yet but I</font>
