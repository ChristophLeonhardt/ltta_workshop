just when you think things can't get any stupider they do on Sunday President Trump tweeted out a gif of himself clotheslining someone knocked me into the ground then pummeling him at an old WWE event in the gift the head of Trump's victim has been replaced with the CNN logo so Trump appears to be tackling then beating the hell out of the network in most despises the one he's used as a foil in his rise to power Trump CNN tweet followed on the heels of his tweets from last week in which he attacked MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough in the most personal terms Trump supporters responded with unrestrained leads much of this Trump was fighting back CNN meanwhile responded with the typical restraint and objectivity reporter after Reporter declared the Trump's we didn't merely represent an obvious breach of decency and unpresidential and apparently pathological outburst of spontaneous rage tweeting it promoted violence and Trump would have blood on his hands if some rogue follower picked up a gun and decided to come after brian Stelter Trump supporters responded to this outpouring of faux rage by CNN by shouting about Kathy Griffin carrying around a bloodied mop head of Trump Julius Caesar presented by Shakespeare in the Park as an assassination of Trump and Democrats from coast to coast to proclaim that Trump care would end with grandma being shoved off a cliff by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in this Kabuki theater both sides are right in both sides are wrong the media are right the president is acting out in a fashion that makes my three-year-olds temper tantrum seem mature by comparison Trump supporters are right that the media's coverage is so wildly corrupt and hysterical it makes Leo bloom and the producers look like Mother Teresa the media are wrong that their liberties are some sort of existential assault from the president who's merely mouthing off the way he has this entire career Trump supporters are wrong that all evils can be excused by simply pointing at the latest media bad actor and yelling war are at the top of your lungs so here we are a media nobody trusts school harming a president who's the class clown nobody looks really good in this particular fake wrestling match the question is actually why anyone engages in it at all after all we know the match isn't real from so adores media attention that of CNN and the New York Times were to stop covering him he quickly set himself on fire outside their studios for the cameras likewise if Trump were to stop tweeting CNN would have to go back to covering missing Malaysian airliner it's a romance made in hell but the ratings are absolutely stellar so the question remains why does everyone treat this game as if it's being played for high stakes well it's entertaining and entertaining conflicts must have clear good and evil combatants because the media are corrupt in trouble mature both sides must willingly blind themselves to the fault of their favorite characters so the right says the Trump of the virginal political victim a neophyte undeserving of his critics vitriol even better he's held up as an unparalleled political genius the voice of the people the populist revolutionary and the guise of the prince of the city a sort of Bruce Wayne who down at the Cape of Justice by night and tweets raged the media by day while the music from The Dark Knight thunders dramatically in the background the hand will effect from stopping the Joker Hillary never fades in the eyes of Trump supporters meanwhile the press overlooks its own participation in the corrupted political entertainment complex in order to paint itself as thoroughly painstaking and objective in its work journalists see themselves and left flatteringly sees the journalists as warriors for truth exposing the light in every dark nook and cranny of the Trump administration they imagine themselves in battered hats and trench coats walking around in the rain looking for all of the evidence of the dark deeds uncovering the seedy side of Trump aney Hall the halo effect from opposing Trump never dies for the Fourth Estate this Manicheans dichotomy means that there is no way for any reasonable or tempered debate to emerge over proper behavior or coverage instead there's Glee for Trump's base and watching Trump bring justice to the streets of media Gotham flinging VAT orangs masseur Beck nastiness at Mecca Brzezinski's bloody face and for the media there is similar Glee in proclaiming Trump and incipient Hitler a Willie Stark who must be stopped before it can transform into real-life Huey Long all of this makes the political scene a lot more fun and entertaining but it's not very useful well the drama of Trump versus the media is amusing it's not quite WWE quality because most people actually think that it's real we can find the WWE entertaining and amusing because we know it's scripted but if we actually thought it was real and then all of a sudden we were rudely disabused of that notion it would probably ruin the fun the same is true of our politics right now the realization that Trump versus the media is just overblown stupidity half scripted on both sides makes the conflict less compelling the comedy actually becomes kind of tragic after all it's a lot easier to laugh at the antics of the undertake Undertaker than to laugh as the office of George Washington and the industry of ernie pyle both become punchlines i'm ben shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay so the CNN has completely let itself on fire so yesterday was July 4th and in honor of Independence Day she and then held the fireworks celebration in its own pants it lit all of the TNT that I could find and then proceeded to blow it up absolutely destroying itself wholesale we will talk about all of it because it is really amusing I just said we shouldn't talk so much about the WWE stuff but I'm going to because it's hilarious oh we'll talk about all of that stuff in a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at blinds comm so I'm sure you don't think too much about your blinds but let's face it they're really ugly and you need to replace them because

they destroyed themselves he really gave them enough rope that they decided not just to hang themselves but to hang themselves by the neck until they were nearly dead then pull themselves up back onto the platform and jump repeatedly this is basically what CNN is doing now so here's how this works out over the course of the weekend so on Sunday president Trump tweets something that I assume my three and a half year old daughter has the good sense not to tweet a WWE wrestling graphic of himself tackling a person with a CNN logo for a head and then jumping on top of them and pummeling them right the President of the United States let me forget George Washington and Abraham Lincoln once sat well George Washington did but Abraham Lincoln once sat in the office where Joe where Donald Trump is tweeting in the middle of the night from the toilet presumably about racially so so he tweets this and here's what it looks like everything is so stupid okay so he tweets that and then he and then he enjoy for its independence day he said to double down on that he starts mocking the fake media which is his favorite thing to do right he's he North Korea may be firing the intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting Alaska but he's got to hit the fake media I mean come on so it's the Independence Day and in the middle of it see she jumped out that he starts ripping on the fake media all right the fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them because the people know the truth the fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House but I'm president and they're not okay so that's their I mean the media hated him they tried to stop him from going to the White House and now they're trying to take him down all that is fair they're not exactly silencing him he's pretty loud it turns out and he uses his Twitter a lot so that really doesn't change anything but yes the media are bad yes the media are obviously trying to cover him in unfair fashion so he tweets this stupid thing about wrestling the media has an obvious response they could say mr. president that was a stupid thing to tweet maybe you don't have a lot of self-control that would be true it would also be obvious and it would be relatively objective instead they proceeded to spend the next three days talking about how this means that Donald Trump wants to literally go and beat brian Stelter spacing right it really he's a sick Nazi who wants to murder people and that's why he's tweeting outwrestling tweets from the WWE like I'm first of all it doesn't make any sense to me they use the CNN logo over at Miz Vince McMahon's face is CNN's logo a person like how can you even hit CNN's logo it's a it's not a say it's not a person like how unless brian Stelter changed his face and had surgery I can old Twilight Zone episodes and now his face looks like the CNN logo I don't see how anyone would identify one with the other but in any case the left went hysterical so Howard Dean says it's just right-wingers and they want to shoot places up it's all because of Trump it's Trump and he's a Nazi so it's not enough for them just to say that the Trump is is ridiculous in how he uses Twitter which is obviously for no no he's evil and he's a Nazi and then you'll see they went even further because they're totally insane they've lost their minds Trump has trolled them so hard that they have actually become that which they fear so here is Howard Dean first saying that Trump is evil and violent a lot of the Trump voters are not the far-right nutcases with guns who want to you know shoot up the place most of the Trump voters are be anyone was defining them that way know what there certainly are some of them and the NRA put an appalling ad out there which really didn't basically made this a mini okay so what the Howard Dean who's a complete moron is talking about how the right is full of violent people let us unless we forget three weeks ago a Trump hating Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate several dozen Republican Congress people but were the violent ones right it's the Trump supporters who are the violent ones those of us on the right where the violent ones okay so Trump tweets out this WW thing and media's first reaction is Crump is violent and then they get their second reaction so it's not enough for them to be clown themselves the first way they have to proclaim themselves every way they have to find new ways to bolon themselves every single day so what do they do CNN goes CNN goes ahead and runs a story trying to find the source of the main right because Trump didn't create this little video of himself tackling the CNN logo somebody took the WWE video and pasted the CN and logo in there so where did he get it so he got it supposedly according to CNN from some guy at reddit for those who don't know reddit sort of an underground political thread it's very big website a lot people visit it are the Donald is where all of these memes pop up and I sort of have a love-hate relationship with other than I don't sometimes they like me sometimes they don't it's always an inverse relationship with how nice I'm being to Trump that day so I'm sure they'll love this episode in any case are the Donald post this meme there's a guy whose name is I can't actually say it out loud because it's cursing it's Han bleep hole solo okay and this is now national media coverage we have to discuss these things because this is everything is stupid so he puts out this meme right hon bleep hole solo puts out this meme and CNN traces it back to him and then CNN goes and looks at all the other memes that he's put out and turns out he's put out a bunch of racist anti-semitic names because there are a lot of people on reddit who do this I know because I was the personal recipient a 40% of all anti-semitic memes that were tweeted on the Internet at journalists last year I personally was the recipient of so I'm well aware of this entire crowd I mean well aware of the bleep posters as they call themselves in any case they decide to dig up all of this ancillary material and then pretend that Trump is somehow linked to that so first of all this is bad journalism it's bad journalism because it would be one thing if Trump tweeted an anti-semitic meme and then they said okay here is the world Vance Medic memes from which he is drawing that would be able to good story right or if they'd said he keeps going over to Reddit and 4chan he has a long-standing relationship with Reddit and 4chan where he takes their memes why is he so warm toward these people that's a fair story what is not a fair story is he picks up one piece of material from the art Donald thread and now we're going to find the person who created that who Trump has never met probably never seen and never in none of this came like some probably had no relationship with this person ever he doesn't know who they are from Adam and then we're going to find everything that guy ever did and then we are going to wink all the bad things that I did with Trump right you can see how far they're stretching so already this is a stupid story already this is an idiotic story Trump didn't tweet anything racist or anti-semitic he tweeted something dumb and now they're trying to link him with racism and anti-semitism because the original creator of this wrestling Jeff gif was was some schmuck who tweets out anti-semitic racist stuff okay so that's dumb in and of itself but then they go a level dumber okay I told you things are just going to get stupider from here on it right eventually as I said last week America will disappear because we all go brain dead from loss of IQ points due to following politics too closely because this is all so stupid so it goes a level deeper in the stupidity so now CNN doesn't just crack down on a whole solos name right they don't just track down who he is they don't just track down what else he's tweeted now they go to him and they reach out to him and he immediately sees what's happening he's he's they're not going to target him and so what he decides to do is apologize or he puts a big apology he takes down all of the terrible tweets it takes all of the terrible memes and then CNN prints the story and here is what they print ok this is from the CNN story direct quote quote CNN is not publishing Han a-hole solos name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology showed remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again in addition he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change okay so for those of you who missed what just happened that's called blackmail right what CNN is doing now is they are now saying he took down all the stuff that we didn't like he took the racist and else we took on CNN stuff but should he renege should he become a recidivist a reddit recidivist he'd become a meme recidivist should you go out on the street and threaten America America again with other WWE linked videos then we will reveal his name to the public at large right CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change what so now they have taken what was an obvious and clear win on Sunday right Trump making fun of them with some stupid meme and they could make fun of him back and an obvious one and they have destroyed themselves three separate ways first by claiming that Trump is violent and this is promoting violence second by trying to track down everything possible about this mean guy and third by then threatening the meme guy that if he doesn't back down from this they are going to out him right that is that CNN has now blown all journalistic credibility out of some pathetic sick attempt to get Donald Trump and anyone who is remotely linked with Donald Trump that's how insane all of this is I mean it's totally crazy and this is what he is doing but wait it gets even better okay so just keep going the story gets even better but before I tell you the rest of the story I have to say thank you to our sponsors over at tracker so I am a person who is incredibly absent-minded which is why I have to have two people telling me every morning what I'm doing that day and that does not include my wife we would really have to build a company you tell me what my schedule is every day because I'm so absent-minded I lose my wallet phone and keys all the time and it was time you get frustrated my wife also has a tendency to do that so we stare at each other in annoyance on a frequent basis wondering where we put our stuff and that's why our marriage has been improved dramatically by by tracker tracker is just great what you do is this tracker device like a coin size device you stick it on a keychain and then it connects to your phone with a program and you can hit this button on your phone and now your keys will start beeping and you can find your keys or if you lose your phone then you can actually hit the thing on your keys and that will link to your phone and even if your phone is on silent right this happens all the time you lose your phone it's on silent you can't find it instead it now rings through so you'll never lose your wallet or your phone or your keys again your marriage will be better you will become a better person I promise that your marriage will if you're on the verge of divorce now you'll have the most glorious marriage that ever was thanks to tracker because that's just what they do you're never going to lose this stuff again tracker changes everything so they have something a new that's called the tracker pixel and the tracker pixels lettuce Bluetooth tracking device on the market again put it on everything and it we put it on our baby so that we don't lose the baby and you'll never lose anything again right now you can get the third they also have a 30-day money-back guarantee go to tracker comments tra CK are calm the tracker calm enter that promo code Ben you get 20% off any order you choose that the tracker calm promo code Ben for 20% off the tracker calm promo code Ben and you're never going to lose anything again which for me is an important thing and I think it will be for you as well okay so we are we're through three of the four steps in CNN's total self allowing I mean at this point the only way to describe this is that they deliberately decided to kick themselves in the groin as hard as humanly possible and now all of their appendages are out of order because it just continues okay so here's where it goes from here now CNN defends itself from the blackmail accusations he no no we never blackmailed anyone they said we decided not to publish the name of the reddit user out of concern for his safety here's the problem you also threatened to release his name if he changed his behavior so where is the safety threat coming from now CNN it's coming from you because you're threatening to release his name if he doesn't obey you but that's not the bad part okay that's not the bad part here is the worst part they got the wrong guy okay they got the wrong guy to track down Rebel Alliance hero Han a whole solo they tracked him down on planet Endor and then they failed to get the right guy they got the wrong guy so BuzzFeed here's BuzzFeed reporting on this river this is amazing according to BuzzFeed quote one user pointed out that what Trump tweeted wasn't actually Han a-hole solos gift Trump's gift included both video and audio whereas the rebel smuggled wannabes gift did not include audio furthermore the original Han a whole solo gift was shorter had a different aspect ratio and had a WWE logo in the corner not even the colors are processed in the same manner han Solo Han a holding solos gift has an NTSC aspect ratio because it was cut directly from the taping of an analogue one at WrestleMania footage Trump's video has an aspect ratio of 16 to 9 and it continues someone downloaded the gift that Han a whole solo originally posted to Reddit the person cropped it to better fit a video player like Facebook or YouTube they went through the effort of syncing it back up with the audio from the original clip then they put it where Trump or one of trumps people could see it and download it so in other words something you can get it from reddit okay Trump got it from facebook from got it from Facebook or from YouTube and then you put it up so their friends link this guy who made it on reddit who's not linked to Trump in any way they're trying to link to the ancillary stuff that Trump has never seen to Trump in order to call Trump a racist anti-semite and then they got and then they're threatening the guy and they got the wrong guy come here no this is just its sheer incompetence of the highest order and all this does of course is it helps Trump but I mean Trump is just sitting there going I've been calling them taking these all the time should I say the fake news even when the reporting we do stuff but now they're big news all the time it's just like could he have paid them like Trump doesn't even have to buy them because he now owns them right or if he doesn't own them they self owned I mean it's just it's unbelievable it's just incredible and that wasn't by the way even that is not the end of the story because yesterday CNN two times two times apparently had fake quotes one from Abraham Lincoln you know dumb you have to be to run a story that is a fake quote from Abraham Lincoln kiss on she's making new stuff up every day Abraham Lincoln tonight he's coming out with new material that you have to bet isn't dead for 150 years I mean president from may not know that he thinks Andrew Jackson stole ivon toes Frederick Douglas but but the fact is it Abraham Lincoln I think Trump is aware that he's dead and certainly CNN should be I mean no the one saying Trump is so stupid even don't quote Abraham Lincoln when he's not saying news that it's just it's unbelievable and then everyone wonders why trust in the media may be declining I can't imagine why trust in the media is declining so when we continue on the other side here I want to talk about some Republican silliness that happened over the weekend also on the media because we can't just have say the Republicans have gone we've gotten the point where the tensions be partisan silliness there have to be bipartisan silliness like everyone has to drink the kuku juice and now everyone has lost their minds so we'll get to more insanity July 4th insanity but first you're going to have to go
