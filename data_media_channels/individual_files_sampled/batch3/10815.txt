German drug and pesticides maker Bayer will close its largest ever foreign takeover on Thursday it's buying up Monsanto the largest US producer of genetically modified seeds and agricultural chemicals the German giant is hoping to strengthen its portfolio in the health and nutrition sectors with the acquisition but given Monsanto's legacy that may not be so easy Samira Khan explains one of the world's biggest brands and most controversial agricultural companies Monsanto will soon cease to exist well as we know it it'll be bought out by Bayer the German pharmaceutical giant and the company has announced that it will be shedding the Monsanto name the one which used to make headlines as thousands of protesters hit the streets across the globe despite the fact that Monsanto will no longer exist Bayer will be inheriting each and every lawsuit attached to the company around 4,000 of them in the US alone on top of that approximately two thousand legal hearings are still pending and one of the biggest trials to come this month is based on accusations that the company hid that its products could cause cancer for decades at the center of all of those lawsuits Monsanto's leading herbicide roundup and its main ingredient with glyphosate according to the International Agency for research on cancer it's called probably carcinogenic to humans their study has also found strong evidence of a link between glyphosate exposure and lymphoma what provokes me about Monsanto is that it can sell us poison year after year nobody cares what revolts me is that there is only us here today Monsanto has been implicated in the scandal in various ways court documents released last year showed that Monsanto manufactured scientific studies and thrived at scientists to publish them but at the same time the company claims that roundup is safe glyphosate based herbicides are supported by one of the most extensive worldwide human health and environmental databases ever compiled for a pesticide product Monsanto's new owner has provided assurances that the merger will make things right as fairs ready to hear critics out we aim to deepen our dialogue with society we will listen to our critics and work together where we find common ground agriculture is too important to allow ideological differences to bring progress to a standstill you're talking about progress to try and find new herbicides that simply hasn't happened and they may have reached the end of their line if you're talking about progress to try and convince Americans and the rest of the planet that roundup is safe while they've been doing that leaked documents showed that when they knew that the World Health Organization was going to declare glyphosate a probable human carcinogen they created an entire plan to quote orchestrate outcry they ghostwrote studies they ghostwrote opinion pieces documents all show showed that they had their own man inside the epa working quietly on behalf of monsanto and blocking additional research that might have indicated and verified that it was a carcinogen so i don't know exactly what their means by progress but it doesn't look good but dealing with the alleged dangers of Monsanto products is not the only issue bothering the public there are fears the two giant companies will form a monopoly that could pick farmers are you're looking at a very big conglomerate now because Monsanto was a giant and Bayer is a giant in health and agriculture and now you're combining those when you create a giant company that controls all of these assets it makes it harder on the smaller companies that just specialize in one or maybe two of the functions of Bayer so it's good to affect farmers if I did it will affect all of us in the long run you
