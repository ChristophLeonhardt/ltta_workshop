1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,110
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A GOOFBALL.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,931
I THINK THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT
NOW, AND HE IS A CHILD, SO

3
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:07,730
HE WILL TWEET LIKE A CHILD.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,620
HE WILL OFTEN ADMIT THINGS THAT
HE SHOULDN'T ADMIT IN TWEETS,

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,700
KIND OF LIKE HIS SON, AND HE
WILL END TWEETS WITH SAD,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,960
BABY, THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,740
HE WILL MISSPELL THINGS, HE WILL
GET FACTS HORRIBLY WRONG, SO

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,320
OBVIOUSLY, HIS STAFF FROM TIME
TO TIME MAKES AN EFFORT TO TAKE

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
HIS TWEETER AWAY FROM HIM, AS
RICK PERRY WOULD SAY,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,380
SPEAKING OF UNINTELLIGENT
PEOPLE.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,940
THEY'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,020
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN THEY TRY
TO TAKE AWAY HIS TWITTER

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,020
MACHINE.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,220
HE WAS TALKING TO MARK LEIBOWITZ
FOR NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE AND

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,300
HE SAYS, THEY WANT TO DELAY MY
VOICE.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,239
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY
MY SOCIAL MEDIA.

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,900
FIRST OF ALL, WHO IS THEY?

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,200
IT IS YOUR OWN GUYS WHO ARE
LIKE, MR.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
PRESIDENT, I'M

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,190
SORRY BUT YOU ARE TOO DUMB.

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,559
YOU KEEP GETTING YOURSELF

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,459
INTO TROUBLE, AND YOU KEEP
ADMITTING THINGS YOU

23
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,860
SHOULDN'T ADMIT AND IT IS
GETTING ALL OF US IN TROUBLE.

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,000
PLEASE PUT DOWN THE TWITTER.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,040
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY, I LIKE
THAT ONE.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,180
SAD.

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,320
BABY.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,630
FOR THE MOMENT BEING, HE DOES
KEEP HIS ACCOUNT AND HE IS

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,950
STILL TWEETING AND I THINK THAT
IS GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA.

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,939
YES, IT MAKES US LOOK RIDICULOUS
BECAUSE HE IS NOW OUR

31
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,200
PRESIDENT, BUT AT LEAST HE WILL
PROBABLY ADMIT TO SEVERAL

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,409
DIFFERENT CRIMES ACCIDENTALLY ON
TWITTER, AND IT WILL HELP

33
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,900
GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE.

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,009
MARK LEIBOWITZ, FROM HIS POINT
OF VIEW SAID, "NO, I THINK IT

35
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,369
LEADS TO BETTER TRANSPARENCY."

36
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:46,729
OF COURSE IT DOES.

37
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,490
IT DOES,
THAT IS THE ONE THING IT

38
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,490
DOES DO.

39
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,060
WE HAVE BETTER TRANSPARENCY INTO
THAT MIND WHETHER WE LIKE

40
00:01:52,060 --> 00:00:00,000
IT OR NOT.
