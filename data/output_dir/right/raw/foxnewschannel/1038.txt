00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:10,005
ABBY: WE ARE BACK WITH A FOX

00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:10,906

00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:16,545
JONG-UN.

8
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:17,779
PETE: THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:18,680
ARRIVED OVERNIGHT AFTER HIS

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,249
LONGEST TRIP OVERSEAS.

00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,717
HE WAS GREETED BY SINGAPORE'S

12
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:23,051
FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER.

13
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:25,621
BUT WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT

14
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,188
THE DICTATOR?

15
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:28,390
AND WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP UP

16
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,757
AGAINST?

17
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:31,493
HERE WITH INSIGHT, POLICY

18
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:32,861
ANALYST FOR THE HERITAGE

19
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:33,795
FOUNDATION'S ASIAN STUDIES

20
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:34,963
CENTER RILEY WALTERS.

21
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:36,164
GOOD MORNING, RILEY.

22
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:37,132
WHO IS KIM JONG-UN?

23
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:40,636
>> WELL, KIM JONG-UN IS THE

24
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:42,437
THIRD KIM OF THE KIM REGIME,

25
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:44,006
REPLACING HIS FATHER IN 2011,

26
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:47,109
KIM JONG-UN HAS SHOWN TO BE A

27
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:50,245
PRETTY BRUTAL DICTATOR OF SORTS.

28
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:51,380
HE RECENTLY JUST IN THE PAST

29
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,080
COUPLE YEARS ASSASSINATED HIS

30
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,087
BROTHER, AND HE'S KNOWN TO

31
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:00,956
REMOVE HIGH LEVEL ASSISTANTS IN

32
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,591
A VERY NONSUBTLE WAY IN ORDER TO

33
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:05,294
ESTABLISH HIS POWER, AS YOU

34
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,428
COULD SAY, IN NORTH KOREA.

35
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:09,398
HE'S CONTINUED TO TAKE NORTH

36
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:12,100
KOREA DOWN A PATH OF BELLIGERENT

37
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,734
GOALS, DEVELOPING NUCLEAR

38
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:15,571
CAPABILITIES, AND, YOU KNOW,

39
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:17,739
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE NOW HOW

40
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:18,774
THINGS ARE DEVELOPING, THOUGH

41
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:19,007
THINGS ARE DEVELOPING, THOUGH.

42
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:19,675
PETE: RILEY, I'M GOING TO

43
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:20,876
ATTEMPT TO ASK A NUANCED

44
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:21,476
QUESTION HERE.

45
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:22,778
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL WORK OR

46
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,079
NOT.

47
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,416
BUT IS THIS A GUY WHO RELISHES

48
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:28,984
THE RUTHLESSNESS, WHO WANTS TO

49
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:34,923
LOCK PEOPLE UP AND KILL THEM, OR

50
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:36,191
A GUY WHO HAS INHERITED HIS

51
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,225
THRONE AND DONE WHAT IS

52
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,660
NECESSARY TO KEEP HIS POWER BUT

53
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,531
IS LOOKING FOR AN OFF RAMP?

54
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,666
>> HE MIGHT NOT BE AS RUTHLESS

55
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:45,534
AS WE THINK.

56
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:47,469
IT IS A NUANCED QUESTION SO IT

57
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,404
REQUIRES A NUANCED ANSWER.

58
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:52,808
HE TESTS TRUMP, THEY CONTINUE TO

59
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,176
TEST CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL

60
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,778
WARFARE WEAPONS, BUT AT THE SAME

61
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:59,348
TIME HE MIGHT ALSO BE SHOWING

62
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:02,117
BRUTAL PUNISHMENT OF HIGH LEVEL

63
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:02,851
EFFICIENT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN

64
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:05,887
HIS POWER, WHICH, IN A SENSE, IF

65
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:06,822
HE CAN ASSERT THAT HE HAS

66
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,056
CONTROL, HE MIGHT BE LESS

67
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:09,291
RUTHLESS IN THE END

68
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:09,524
RUTHLESS IN THE END.

69
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:10,258
ABBY: WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S

70
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,793
WILLING TO COME TO THE

71
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:12,728
NEGOTIATING TABLE NOW?

72
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:13,996
HAVE THINGS GOTTEN SO BAD FOR

73
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:15,364
NORTH KOREA THAT HE'S FEELING

74
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:17,499
LIKE AT THIS POINT HE JUST

75
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:18,233
DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE, THEY

76
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,301
CAN'T GO ON ANYMORE?

77
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,235
>> THANKS TO OUR MAXIMUM

78
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:23,038
PRESSURE I THINK, CERTAINLY.

79
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:24,306
YOU KNOW, THE NORTH KOREAN

80
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:27,175
ECONOMY IS -- IT'S HURTING RIGHT

81
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:27,476
NOW.

82
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,677
KIM JONG-UN HIMSELF I THINK

83
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:31,947
REALIZES THIS, AND I THINK HE

84
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,415
THINKS THAT IT IS POTENTIAL THAT

85
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:34,983
YOU KNOW, HE CAN MAKE A DEAL

86
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:36,184
WITH THE AMERICANS.

87
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:38,754
HE HAS THE NUKES, SO HE HAS THE

88
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:39,921
LEVERAGE TO MAKE A DEAL.

89
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:40,989
HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO GIVE

90
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,124
THOSE UP BUT OF COURSE WE SHOULD

91
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:43,492
CONTINUE TO APPLY THIS MAXIMUM

92
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:45,260
PRESSURE UNTIL WE CAN ACTUALLY

93
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,796
VERIFY THAT HE IS WILLING TO

94
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:48,530
COMMIT THIS TIME.

95
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,899
GRIFF: RILEY, WE JUST HAD

96
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:51,633
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI ON WHO SAID

97
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,135
KIM JONG-UN MAY BE A MUCH MORE

98
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:56,838
RATIONAL PERSON THAN PEOPLE GIVE

99
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:57,172
CREDIT.

100
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:57,839
WHAT DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT

101
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,941
TRUMP WILL SEE IN THESE FIRST

102
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:01,576
MOMENTS WHEN HE MEETS KIM

103
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,144
JONG-UN?

104
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:06,314
>> WELL, I THINK HE'LL SEE A

105
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:07,049
DICTATOR WHO HAS, YOU KNOW, IS

106
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:07,783
OFTEN REVERED AS A GOD WITHIN

107
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:10,318
HIS OWN COUNTRY, AND A MAN WHO

108
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:11,820
OFTEN PEOPLE SAY -- NO ONE

109
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,923
ACTUALLY EVER SAYS "NO" TO.

110
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:16,191
SO, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOING TO BE

111
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,426
COMING AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IN

112
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:22,130
HIMSELF IS VERY, IN HIS MIND,

113
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,497
ELEVATED.

114
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:23,999
AND SO AT FIRST IT COULD BE VERY

115
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,767
-- THEY COULD GET TOGETHER, YOU

116
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,403
KNOW, IF DENNIS RODMAN IS RIGHT

117
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,371
AND, YOU KNOW, KIM HIMSELF IS A,

118
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:30,605
YOU KNOW, FAIRLY NICE GUY, THEN

119
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:31,807
THEY COULD GET ALONG.

120
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:34,376
I THINK WHETHER THEY GET ALONG

121
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:35,143
OR NOT REALLY ACTUALLY DEPENDS

122
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:35,744
DONALD TRUMP ON THIS.

123
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,746
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, IF HE LIKES

124
00:03:37,746 --> 00:00:00,000
HIM, IT WILL BE GOOD.
