and as hard as I am on Rachel Notley and she deserves all of it Alberta right now spends twenty-seven hundred dollars more per person in government spending than BC and that didn't happen exclusively under Rachel Notley it's increasing under Rachel Notley but it happened under the Conservatives who were also beholden to the public sector unions they seem to need the support of the public sector unions to win so it's not just something that the NDP or the Liberals do conservative politicians are playing this game too yes particularly in in Alberta it was right he was elected strictly on the backs of the unions they had something called five-minute memberships during the leadership briefs she made a plate for the Union said hey we're gonna look after you if I get elected as leader and the teachers unions rushed out and bought memberships for just for the sole purpose of you know voting at the leadership election and it helped and what was the very first thing that Redford did she gave a hundred and seventy five million dollars back to the the teachers in additional spending they say oh well it's from you know it's classrooms books chalkboards and pens and papers but that's BS the biggest single expense in any level of government as their compensation in education eighty percent of every dollar that goes into education goes direct into a payroll package for the people working in the system there's a huge pension apartheid in Canada the gap teacher in Ontario is a median salary of ninety five thousand dollars a year when they retire they're getting a 70 percent pension on that that's more than the average working stiff and the province is making while they're working and they're going to collect that for another thirty years it's the biggest fraud the biggest plunder of wealth in our generation and it's still uh you know untold stew it's still in a widely misunderstood by by most Canadian so watch for what happens in in Alberta not leak Olli do you remember the first few days of the Notley government somebody called in to the premier's office and it was answered by somebody from the Alberta Union of public employees they didn't even say hi it's the premiers office he said iets obey Alberta no public employees that's how close you know it was the huge hit that farmers took with that that horrible bill that Notley first introduced that was a something that has been percolating and had been going through union discussions for several years that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
