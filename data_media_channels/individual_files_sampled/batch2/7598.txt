TYT is partnering with participant media to help solve the climate crisis will not be great now look you got to check out our series 10 days of action to learn more about what you can do to make a difference and go see inconvenience equal truth to power in theaters in New York and LA on July 28th and nationwide August 4th as we all know Chris Christie is not doing so well when it comes to his approval rating and people have been heckling him and giving him a difficult time in fact after he shut down a beach and then enjoyed that shut down beach with his family his own constituents called him while he was on a radio show and started yelling at him and talking about how corrupt he is and he didn't take too kindly to that he's trying to be a sports talk show host by the way and he's really trying to do that yeah yes because he couldn't get a job in the Trump administration so he said I don't know I'm gonna be out of a job that I need something that was a joke no no it's true he was on on the fan-in with mike francesca and the names they called them were bully and fat ass look you're in the New York New Jersey area man you think you're gonna go on sports talk and and when you have a popularity to 15% and dropping and you're not gonna get hammered what planet do you live on he was at a he was in a Mets game and he caught a foul ball or a flyball it was a foul ball yeah and there and he's like I caught it it was a boom circular boo okay they blew mercilessly okay that's what happens when you're like yo none of you can go on the beach but I will yeah yeah let alone the bridges shutdown let alone the fact that you know all the ways that he just let New Jersey go and didn't care what happened in the stated center anyway yes so now he's in mordrem now he's in more trouble apparently he was at a baseball game and a Cubs fan heckled him and instead of just letting it go he decided to get into the Cubs fans face let's take a look at the video what do you say to you so the man in the video is Brad Joseph he told a local station WISN that Christie confronted him after he told the New Jersey Governor that he quote sucked and called him a hypocrite Christie initially asked the fan if he needed another beer before calling him a big-shot okay it's not a flattering picture chris Christie with the nachos are leaning over but I would have pardoned him like so the guy got under Sogeti or governor you shouldn't let that bother you and if you're gonna go to the ballgame I don't know if you know this yet people hate you because it's a ballgame they're gonna say bad things let it go you're cheese nachos but uh but you know II didn't do anything that bad he just yelled back at the guy I know it looks so what I think I think what he said to him wasn't that big of a deal in terms of optics it looks really bad but he's not gonna run again I don't think he's gonna run again so I guess if Joe Schmoe was walking down and you're at a Cubs game it was it was Milwaukee bruisin Cubs I guess right so if it's in Milwaukee I think if somebody's walking down with a Cubs Jersey on you suck and that guy turns around and puts a space in your face like that and says you need another beer you know what snap in a fight sometimes so if the guy stood up and said yeah because you're not gonna get my face look down on me cuz that's what a lot of guys do especially drinking ones at baseball games and if a fight happens whose fault is it the guy who was starting to fight which was Chris Christie people yell all the time of baseball games that's a great point because if you noticed the lady in the background said or that was a secret service now it's not because he has nothing to do with the president but it was I'm sure his security and it's one thing to be a tough guy at a ball game if you're just a regular Schmo it's another thing if you got security behind you and you're the governor what likely would have happened and I'm not saying it should have in a situation like that without your security behind you is those cheese touches we've been all over your shirt you know like oh yeah I'm a big show you're a big shot boom okay answers are all over the place and then you know don't do it it's about yeah but yes you do get the you know boss people around a little bit more when you got official security behind you right so that's the only part that's a little but still it's too late I already pardoned them okay as long as you say that then it's fine yeah and my my favorite chris Christie sports story and I that's why I really want him to be a sports talk show host so I can laugh and live life is of course when he was trying to hug Jerry Jones or the Cowboys dude you're representing New Jersey you're in a owners box with the Cowboys and then you're like pathetically trying to rub up against him and he doesn't even want it that's embarrassing dude anything that happened at this game and what is it with Chris Christie that he won't go to like why is he always at other people's games this is Cubs brewers what does that have to do with New Jersey who cares I know I pardon him for going to the game have some fun broadcasting yeah I do not pardon you for trying to rub up against Jerry Joe yeah
