THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE. GO FLY. ♪ ♪ Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT." EVERY AMERICAN IS BORN WITH INHERENT RIGHTS, THAT'S WHAT OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS SAY. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS WHICH HAS BEEN OUR NATIONAL CREATE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, AND IT'S WORKED. FOR THE LEFT NO LONGER BELIEVES THAT. THE LEFT HAS DECIDED THE BILL OF RIGHTS ONLY APPLIES TO PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH THEM AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT COVERS THEIR SECURITY DETAIL. YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO HAVE A GUN AT HOME. NOW THE ACTIVIST LAUGHS TELL US THAT PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM NO LONGER HAVE MOVEMENT FOR ASSOCIATION. LEAVE THEIR HOMES THEY WILL BE SURROUNDED BY MOBS AND A FRIEND. LAST FRIDAY, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WERE FORCED TO LEAVE A RESTAURANT BECAUSE THE OWNER DIDN'T LIKE THE POLITICS. SANDERS AND HER HUSBAND WENT HOME BUT THE REST OF THE FAMILY WENT TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT. BEING RELATED TO SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE SO THEY CONTINUE TO HARANGUE THEM AS THEY CONTINUE TO EAT. PROTESTERS HAVE AMASSED OUTSIDE OF THE HOME OF WHITE HOUSE AIDE TO STEPHEN MILLER. IN CASE THEIR INTENTIONS WEREN'T CLEAR ENOUGH, THEY PUT UP MARK A DHS EMPLOYEE MEANWHILE FOUND A BURN TO COME UP DECAPITATED ANIMAL CARCASS ON HIS FRONT PORCH. THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR, ACTIVISTS ON THE LEFT ARE MOVING TOWARD APPLAUDED. A PIECE YESTERDAY IN "SPLINTER NEWS" WHICH IS THE OWNED BY UNIVISION, THAT'S BOTH JUST THE MINIMUM BASELINE HERE." HOW EXTREME? THE ARTICLE FONDLY RECALLS THE DOMESTIC TERROR BOMBINGS OF THE 1970s. THOUSANDS PER YEAR IN AMERICA, THAT'S OUR FUTURE, THE ARTICLE SAYS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE HEADED THERE FAST. CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS PURGED OF THE MOB TO HUNT DOWN AND FIND MEMBERS OF THE IF YOU YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET. YOU HAVE MEMBERS OF YOUR CABINET THAT ARE BEING BOOED OUT OF RESTAURANTS. PROTESTERS ARE TAKING ABOUT THEIR HOUSE. THEY ARE GETTING NO PEACE, NO SLEEP. NO PEACE, NO SLEEP. LET'S MAKE SURE WE SHOW UP WHEREVER WE HAVE TO SHOW UP AND IF YOU SEE ANYBODY FROM THAT STATION, YOU GET OUT AND YOU FORM A CROWD AND YOU PUSH BACK ON THEM. YOU TELL THEM THEY ARE NOT WELCOME ANYMORE, ANYWHERE. Tucker: MAXINE WATERS ISN'T JUST ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS, "THE DAILY BEAST" CALLS HER "A FOLK HERO." "BUZZFEED" CALLS FOR THE NEW UNFAZED CHALLENGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SHE IS ALSO A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE WEIRD THAT SHE'S DEMANDING CERTAIN PEOPLE BE DENIED PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S SAYING AND SHE SAID IT AGAIN YESTERDAY. I STAND BY MY SPEECH, AND SAYING THAT THE PROTESTS HAVE CONSIDERS THE POLITICAL OPPONENTS FELLOW CITIZENS OR EAT EVEN HUMAN. HOW LONG UNTIL THEY START OPENLY CALLING FOR SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN TO THOSE APPOINTMENTS? IN THE CASE OF MAXINE WATERS, IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME. IN 1992, WATERS CHEERED AS A RACIST MOBS BURNED IN LOS ANGELES. WHEN REGINALD DENNY WAS DRAGGED FROM HIS TRUCK AND NEARLY MURDERED FOR THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN, BEATEN WITH A CINDER BLOCK IN THE HEAD ON CAMERA, WATERS PARTIED WITH THEM AFTER HIS WASHINGTON KNOWS THAT AND DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE. CHUCK SCHUMER DID CALLED WATERS IN HIS MOST RECENT REMARKS "NOT AMERICAN," GOOD FOR HIM. THAT WAS THE THEME. I FEEL THAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO NAZI GERMANY. THE TOTALITARIAN BEHAVIOR IS SHOCKING AND HORRENDOUS. WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. THEY FOLLOW THE EXACT PATTERN THAT HAS OR HAS, HE IS EVIL. AND AT THE THING IS, I THOUGHT I WILL COME IN AND HE WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE HE HAS TO DO HIS SHOWMANSHIP THING, BUT HE'S EVIL. THIS IS PURE AND SIMPLE RACE, RACISM, THAT'S ALL THIS IS. PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM ARE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH OF THIS COUNTRY BECOMING THE BROWNING OF INTERESTING IS HAPPENING. AS PROGRESSIVES BECOME MORE AUTHORITARIAN AND LESS, TOLERANT, THEY SEEM MORE CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING ACTUAL RATHER THAN THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS. THE MORE THEY ACCUSED THE ADMINISTRATION OF EXTREMISM, THE ONCE YOU DECIDE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU ARE NAZIS, EVERYTHING IS ALLOWED. THIS COULD VERY WELL END IN TRAGEDY, SOME PROGRESSIVE SEEMED TO WELCOME ALL THAT. SUPPORTS DEMOCRATS. IT IS SAYS THEY ARE ACCOMPLICES. THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF TOTAL WAR. IT'S SCARY, NO PLACE IN POLITICS. THE ONLY PLACE THAT CAN STOP IT ARE THE ADULTS ON THE LEFT. THERE ARE STILL SOME DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND MEDIA CHIEFTAINS LIKE JEFF ZUCKER AT CNN OR ANTI-LAC AT CNBC. THEY ARE COWERING AND COMPLICIT IN ALL OF THIS BUT THE COUNTRY BADLY NEEDS THEM TO COOL THE CHANNELS.
