1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,840
I had just finished my freshman
year of college.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,320
I was out in the ocean and I dove out and
into a wave,

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,200
something I had done many times 
 before.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,440
I dove into a sandbar that had drifted in,

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,220
which fractured my spine and damaged my spinal cord,

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,720
and that left me as a C5 quadriplegic.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,580
I kept asking the doctors, what can I look
forward to in the future?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,120
One of my doctors said, hey, we want to try
this muscle stimulation device.

9
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,580
It really sounds like it’s something out
of a science fiction novel:

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,700
reconnecting my  mind to my body.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Spinal trauma is one of the toughest
problems in medicine.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,540
There’s currently no biological way of healing
severe damage to the spinal cord.

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,939
Recently, scientists have started developing
a workaround: creating an artificial link

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,280
between the brain and the body.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,880
GAURAV SHARMA: My name is Gaurav Sharma, I’m
the lead investigator on the NeuroLife program

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,820
at Battelle.

17
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,540
So NeuroLife is an electronic neural bypass
technology that can link the brain directly

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,420
to the limb  it controls.

19
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,640
We are developing this technology for people
with paralysis due to spinal cord injury,

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,990
so they can regain control of their own hand.

21
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,640
Ian Burkhart is our first patient in this
study.

22
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,540
Being injured at the C5 level means that
I have pretty good strength through my biceps,

23
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,460
but I don’t really have any movement below
my elbows at all.

24
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,500
I rely on other people to help me every single
day.

25
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,690
They help me get dressed, get transferred
into my wheelchair, um, brush my hair;

26
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,240
and then at the end of the day I also need help
doing everything in reverse

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,740
to get ready for bed.

28
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,600
Independence is my number one goal, and regaining
any use of my hands will really improve my

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,220
independence, so it was something I was all for.

30
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,240
You good?

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,140
Yeah I’m set.

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,020
So this technology has 3 main
components.

33
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,780
The first component is a tiny chip that is
surgically implanted in Ian’s brain, and

34
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,020
that records Ian’s brain activity as he’s
thinking about moving his hand.

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,660
You want a little bit more slack?

36
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,420
No that’s fine.

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,540
It’s good? OK cool.

38
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,090
GAURAV: The second component is a computer
algorithm that decodes Ian’s brain activity

39
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,940
and interprets the movement he is thinking
about.

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,620
And the last component is a wearable sleeve
which has up to 160 electrodes, which activates

41
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,560
the individual muscles to evoke the attempted
movement.

42
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
You said hand open first?

43
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
Hand open first, yeah.

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,440
When I first started with the study,
just trying to open and close my hand was

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,280
extremely challenging.

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,260
I never had to think about moving my hand,
as it was just something that naturally happened.

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,760
So it was something that took a lot of mental
strength.

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,700
OK, you ready?

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,940
Yeah.

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,959
But today, with practice, I’m able
to pick up an object

51
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:27,260
and manipulate that around in space; I’m able to move individual fingers; I can do some complex grasps.

52
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,880
These are looking good today.

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,060
Yeah!

54
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,400
You know, we’ve done everything from
picking up a bottle and pouring it,

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,960
to playing Guitar Hero.

56
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,280
Just being able to control more of your body
that I had thought I had lost forever is something

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,220
that’s really exciting and really promising.

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,620
All right, so I think we’re going to need to move some of these things out of the way.

59
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,100
As Ian gets better at using his hand,
the researchers give him new challenges.

60
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,300
This is his first time trying this homemade
Battleship game,

61
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,100
and the results are a mixed bag.

62
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,300
- Barely had it...
- That looked better, I think.

63
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,040
Yeah, I barely had a hold of it and it
just slipped in.

64
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,620
That’s what happens when you try
a new thing though.

65
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,220
I think you were getting bored with everything
working easily.

66
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,940
Nice to mix things up a little bit.

67
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,280
It’s probably going to be a while
before a system like NeuroLife

68
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,740
restores anything like full functionality.

69
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,220
But it’s a first step towards a future where
a broken connection between mind and body

70
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,520
doesn’t have to be permanent.

71
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,560
For now, Battelle plans to keep refining the
system with Ian and other patients, in the

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,040
hope of turning NeuroLife into a commercial
product within a few years.

73
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,060
The ultimate goal of this project
is someone can actually take it home with them,

74
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,800
and use it for their activities of daily living.

75
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,560
We are working very hard on the hardware side
to make it portable and wearable, so that

76
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,240
Ian can in the morning wake up, put the sleeve
on, and he should be good to go.

77
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,340
If I can help move science so that, in
the future, someone with an injury like mine,

78
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,180
they’ll be back going on with their lives
in a short time, that’s something that,

79
00:06:34,180 --> 00:00:00,000
y’know, I’ll work as hard as I can for.
