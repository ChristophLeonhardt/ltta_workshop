it didn't happen it couldn't happen what
he said was President Obama directed
eavesdropping surveillance illegal
surveillance of him or friends or other
people at Trump Tower or the Trump
campaign that's just not true and I can
tell you that it's not true because the
President of the United States doesn't
have the authority to authorize
electronic surveillance that authority
was taken away from him in the 1970s
with the great intelligence reforms of
that era the only institution of the
United States government that can now
authorized surveillance against a US
person is the US Court system President
Obama could not have done it
