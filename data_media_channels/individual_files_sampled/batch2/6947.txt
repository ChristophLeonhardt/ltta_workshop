a recent survey indicates that a sizable portion of the u.s. doesn't know enough about what occurred during the Holocaust in fact according to this survey one-third of Americans don't believe or at least don't know that six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust now the survey was conducted by the claims conference and they wanted to see how knowledgeable people are in in the u.s. in regard to what happened during the Holocaust they said there are critical gaps both in awareness of basic facts as well as detailed knowledge of the Holocaust in American society to give you some of the specific numbers seventy percent of Americans believe people care less about the Holocaust than they used to a majority 58% said they believe something like the Holocaust could happen again now I want to stop there and comment on in a little bit because one of my biggest fears is that history will repeat itself and it is likely to repeat itself if a we don't educate people on on some of the horrendous things that have happened in the past and be if we limit or censor speech that we disagree with because I think it's important to have dialogue that that raises awareness about things that make us uncomfortable or or raises debates about things that make us uncomfortable so this is these numbers are not good and it gets worse now let's get to the number of people who were killed during the Holocaust and what Americans know thirty one percent of those surveyed do not believe that six million Jews were killed during the Holocaust and think the real death toll is at least 2 million lower this was true for 41% of Millennials so Millennials happen to know a little less about the Holocaust and the argument being made by this organization is that as Holocaust victims those who survived the Holocaust pass away and we don't talk about what happened during the Holocaust as much memories fade people just don't educate themselves as much as - on this situation yeah and it's uh you know first of all the Holocaust is unique in many respects but one of them is how well-documented it was you know the Germans one of the leaders in the Industrial Revolution went about this genocide of the Jews through Europe with all that industrial efficiency and they had names and they had residences and they had property and all of these things were very well documented so the idea somehow that the numbers are fudged or whatever it's it's ludicrous the the dumbing down though of this country is something we're well aware of and it's not unique to the Holocaust the Holocaust is another casualty in a parade of facts that are casualties in the dumbing down of America this is tragic and often as Anna says and the mostly awful thing is that you know you're doomed to repeat it if you don't know it that's what happened and what was so surprising about Iraq it was a it was a replay of Vietnam in so many ways you know no way to get out no good reason to go in and but the Holocaust uniquely tragic and also uniquely well documented and for that reason there's no excuse for those details being questioned and not known by everybody who attends school in us you know I did this story on the damage report this morning with John iadarola I never miss has not been launched yet so I've done it a few times also okay moving on why the hell not come in at 9 o'clock in the morning like four times yeah we're doing well we're all doing it so I hope that John Tyrol will be able to do something for us someday yeah totally yeah will you get paid right I get paid the so the I was not discouraged so much by these numbers because you know we're now 70 plus years seventy three years out since the end of World War two in the liberation of the camps history is happening very fast big moments have happened since then we're like in the 20s educationally around the world in the Western world that's a very low ranking this we don't teach well a little discouraged at the Millennial number was so high I think was 22 percent of Millennials didn't know about it like 11% everybody overall though you know and I and I and I look and I think I Millennials are part of this generation where they're taking in all this information and they have more information available to them but it is not contextualized properly it's not curated properly and so I think that's a flaw they have they're not reading deep on something they're reading super there there first of all they're changing the world so I'm not this is not a ripping on Millennials I don't suspect this is substantially different than than how our parents felt that the young people aren't learning history history is a tough thing to teach it's tough to get people to care about it and be interested in it I was history major because I think it's the most interesting thing by far that's taught at any school but that is not shared so we need to do a much better job of teaching and so to me the fact that the you know we're like ninety six percent believe that it happened in 93 percent think it should be taught in schools yeah that's good that's that's a good sign I mean I think so yeah they couldn't name half people can't name a concentration camp whether some people think it was six million or four million that's just ignorant that's not that's not there's no I don't sense Holocaust denial I want to clarify something I actually am not in favor of the way headlines have been written about because the headline for the one article that I have in front of me at the moment says one-third of Americans don't believe six million Jews were murdered that's not the case they just don't know they don't know or they think that four million and if you think four million and not six million that's just because you heard the wrong number it's in your head that's not because you're thinking the Jews are lying about the Holocaust right like I suspect for most of those people probably know if you don't know it was six million they go oh all right six million I got it yeah yeah we we need to strengthen our public education and stop allowing our lawmakers to dismantle it and and defund it because the this is the consequence yeah you have a country full of people who don't genuinely know what what you know the history of the world has been and if we don't know the history then we can't prevent history from repeating itself four hundred thousand I think remaining Holocaust survivors alive you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
