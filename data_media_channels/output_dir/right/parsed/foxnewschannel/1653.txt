IF YOU WANT TO SEND IKE A
CARD GO TO FOXANDFRIENDS.COM
AND WE WILL TELL YOU HOW.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY EARLY.
BRIAN: ALL RIGHT.
MANY IN THE MEDIA HAVE A
NEW -- FEEL AS THOUGH THERE
IS A NEW MEDIA DARLING OUT
THERE.
A NEW REPORT FINDS THAT
STORMY DANIELS ATTORNEY
MICHAEL AVENATTI HAS
APPEARED ON CNN 74 TIMES IN
JUST 10 WEEKS.
ABBY: UNBELIEVABLE.
HERE WITH HIS REACTION WHITE
HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY ARI
FLEISCHER.
A CNN CONTRIBUTOR AT THIS
POINT.
>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE
PROMPT UNDERNEATH HIM SAYS,
RIGHT?
>> YOU COMPARE HIM TO THE
NUMBER OF TIMES THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ON CNN
BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT, I
THINK IT WAS LIKE 30.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
>> WELL, HERE'S THE THING,
LOOK.
WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE TO
A SMALLER DEGREE, LAWYERS
COME, LAWYERS GO AND THEY
TRY TO GET ON TV AS MUCH AS
THEY CAN.
IN THIS CASE I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE LAWYERING IS.
HE COMES ACROSS MUCH MORE AS
A POLITICAL OPERATIVE.
IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO
DO HE IS ENTITLED TO DO THAT
BUT HIS CLIENT, SHE ALREADY
GOT THE 130,000 AND SPILLED
THE BEANS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LEGAL
ISSUES ARE THAT HE IS
REPRESENTING OTHER THAN HE
WANTS TO TAKE DONALD TRUMP
DOWN.
STEVE: FORGET ABOUT THE FACT
THAT HE IS ON THE CHANNEL.
CLEERLG THE
CLEARLG THE
CLEARLY THE CHANNEL SIN
VARIETYING HIM.
>> THIS IS THE BIGGER ISSUE
WITH JOURNALISM TODAY CNN
AND MSNBC HAVE BECOME
OPTIONAL NOT FACTUAL.
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS
THE JOURNALISM IS NOT
WINNING.
MANY PEOPLE TRUST FOX.
MANY PEOPLE DON'T.
MANY PEOPLE DON'T TRUST CNN
AND NTSB.
THEY ARE PUTTING HIM ON WITH
POLITICAL ADVOCATE.
FREQUENCY HOW ASTOUNDING
THEY WANT HIM.
BRIAN: HE HAS EXTREMELY THIN
SKIN.
EVIDENTLY HE THREATENED TO
SUE THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER
FOR A NEGATIVE STORY.
FOX NEWS CONFIRMED THE STATE
BAR OF CALIFORNIA
INVESTIGATING HIM.
THEY ARE LOOKING INTO HIS
BANKRUPTCY, TOO.
THEY ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING
HIM REGARDING ALLEGED UNPAID
TAXES.
SO HE IS STARTING TO SEE THE
OTHER SIDE OF BEING THE
MEDIA DARLING.
THEY FIND OUT WHERE IS HE
FROM?
WHAT HAS HE DONE?
BOTTOM LINE IS MOST OF HIS
CLIENTS ARE DEMOCRATIC
OPERATIVES.
>> ALL TRUE.
THIS IS THE REASON I THINK
HE GOES ON TV BECAUSE HE
ENJOYS BEING MORE THE
POLITICAL OPERATIVE THAN THE
COUNSEL REPRESENTING A
CLIENT.
HERE'S THE THING, HE IS A
SIDE SHOW.
THE REAL LAWYER HERE IS BOB
MUELLER.
THE REAL ISSUE THAT THE
WHITE HOUSE DEALS WITH IS
BOB MUELLER.
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH
MICHAEL COHEN AND WITH
MICHAEL AVENATTI IS A SIDE
SHOW.
THIS IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE
TRUMP PRESIDENCY IN ANY
SERIOUS LEGAL OR POLITICAL
WAY.
AND SO I HAVE NEVER SEEN
SOMEBODY WHO IS A SIDE SHOW
GET SO MUCH TV.
ABBY: PRESIDENT EVERY WAY
WHEN IT COMES TO THE STORMY
DANIELS SITUATION.
WITH YOUR EXPERTISE WOULD
YOU ADVISE HIM TO DO STAY
AWAY OR NOT TOUCH THIS.
>> IGNORE HIM.
HE IS THE SIDE SHOW.
THE ONLY THREAT TO THE WHITE
HOUSE IS BOB MUELLER.
THAT'S A RECEDING THREAT
FRANKLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION ISSUE
ANYWHERE.
FOCUS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT
AND THE THINGS THAT ARE THE
SIDE SHOWS AND PROBABLY THE
MOST PAINFUL THING FOR YOU
WILL AVENATTI IS TO BE
TREATED AS THE SIDE SHOW HE
