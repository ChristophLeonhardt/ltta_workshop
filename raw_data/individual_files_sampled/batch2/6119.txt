another woman has come forward with her allegations regarding abuse by R&B singer R Kelly now there have been several women who have come forward family members of several women who have come forward alleging that he is abusive and preys on underage girls for sexual gratification but this new case involves a woman who is a little different because of the fact that she was extremely young at the time that she had a relationship with our Kelly and she also took a lie-detector test to prove that her allegations against him were in fact truthful now let me give you the details the woman here is a Gironde apace and she was only 15 years old when she met r Kelly she said that through their sexual relationship she was forced to call him daddy and he would call me baby he wanted me to have two pigtails and I had to go out and find little schoolgirl outfits now when he was being tried for a case involving a sex tape that was leaked to the media sex tape featured a 14 year old girl that he not only had sex with but also urinated on jaronda was a huge fan of r Kelly's and actually lied about her age just to be able to go to the trial or court proceedings and so in the beginning she did lie to our Kelly about her age but then later on made it clear that she was only 16 years old when they were having this sexual relationship he apparently made her sign some ridiculous documents claiming that she was admitting to stealing products and then stealing property from him in order to kind of extort her and prevent her from going forward to the authorities now several individuals with first-hand knowledge of the situation have supported pases claims additionally BuzzFeed news which actually broke this story reviewed signed legal documents drafts of settlements between Kelly and pase correspondence between pace and the attorneys involved a polygraph test performed at the request of her attorney regarding her relationship with Kelly a probate court document opening in a state for pace as a result of a civil settlement and a subsequent payment made by Kellys management company toothpaste now this relationship happened in the early 2000s and the reason why she settled was because she came across an attorney who had settled other cases involving women who made these allegations against our Kelly that lawyers name was Susan e Logan's and she wanted to settle she didn't want to open a criminal case she didn't want to go ahead and prosecute him she thought that the right way to go about things was to settle and get as much money as possible the attorney to the attorney did read remember pace at the time was incredibly young and also scared and so she just thought okay well if this is my only option then I guess I'm gonna go with that and so she signed non-disclosure agreements as part of this settlement and even though she knows she's gonna face some possible legal ramifications she's decided to break her silence because she thinks it's important to share her story and what she went through so let's break down some of the worst elements of this so are Kelly in the middle of that disastrous trial where he there was the videotape of him not only having sex with a 14 year old but urinating in her mouth Oh God spots another underage girl at the trial who's a fan has one of his friends reach out to her on social media invite her to a party he signs an autograph for her earlier during the trial he's already scoping her out in the middle of the trial where he could have gotten 15 years he gets acquitted by the way that says a message to her later the new girl like hey if I come forward I do a criminal trial he got acquitted last time you might get acquitted this time right and and the reason why he got acquitted is because there was some doubt regarding the girl in the tape right so all you need to do is plant a seed of doubt among the members of the jury and so if it's not 100% certain that that 14 year old girl was the girl in question well then he'll get acquitted and that's exactly what happened and you know when she was young and she was 15 originally during the trial at 16 when her and art Kelley started having sex she believed him and she thought well you know she didn't testify so she it probably wasn't her you know happen she later saw that same girl at another art Kelly party after the trial which is amazing okay so it gets more amazing then art Kelly starts introducing her to other girls that he wants her to have threesomes with and one of them was the best friend of the girl that the trial was about so those two girls had gone into art Kelly and one of them the best friend stayed with him all the way throughout and is now alleged to still be with him okay and in his house where they're saying that it's a cult and and this woman who came four or jaronda says it is a cult it she says it reminds me of Charles Manson and so one of the things that he would do is threats so I have you I made you sign this paper and remember she's signing it when she's 16 doesn't know what the hell is going on in the world he's she there says that she stole jewelry cash from him as Anna alluded to and that her parents are trying to blackmail him he has her sign that first so he could use it against her exactly and and again she in the beginning she says she was 19 but later after they had sex she said no no I got to be honest with you I'm sixteen and the legal age of consent in Illinois seventeen so I'm under the age of consent and art Kelly said that's totally according to her it's totally fine keep pretending you're 19 if anyone acts ass and try to act like you're 25 so but not during sex there you call me daddy and I call you baby so what I thought was fascinating about this case was that a polygraph test was included and the results of the polygraph indicated that she was being truthful in her answers and among the questions asked was were you honest about your age at the time that you said that you fest up about your actual age and she said yes polygraph tests indicated that that was the truth they also asked let me let me actually go to the results for questions that pace was asked including whether she had intercourse with Kelly if she had told him she was 16 and whether he slapped choked and spit on her during an argument she answered yes to all questions according to the person who conducted the polygraph test he said it is the opinion of the examiner based upon an analysis of her polygraph wreck that she is truthful in her answers she said that she also gave our Kelly her state ID so wasn't even like oh well I didn't believe her that she was 16 I thought she was older no she gave the ID and he's like oh good you're underage perfect hey I don't know that he said those exact words and I've certainly acted that way and then it's not just a polygraph test she has all the documents that she signed and including the non-disclosure agreement all the things that our Kelly mater's signed and she has the checks that they paid her good night Irene I mean whether that then gets turned into a criminal case I don't know if the statute of limitations is done yet for her cases what other actions will flow from that we'll see he is incredibly rich and he might yet when again and in all these allegations but in terms of the reporting on this it's appears to be rock solid yeah so we'll see how this develops but I mean she doesn't have much to gain from coming forward in fact she has a lot to lose because of the fact that she signed those non-disclosure forms it seems like she does have a lot of evidence against him but who knows if that evidence will amount to you know a criminal trial where he'll get prosecuted and convicted okay real quick last things here he and she says he did the things that the others alleged in an earlier report from BuzzFeed as well he would take her phone away and he would take he would say you need to get permission before you go to the bathroom before you eat and once he caught her texting with her friend and he beat her that's where the beating the punching and the spitting comes from and she was truthful about that according to the polygraph and he would record their sex that guy somewhere he's got a treasure trove of tapes a meaning a treasure trove of evidence that prosecutors can use and the last time he had the excuse of oh you can't quite tell one of the girls on the tape now apparently if you had these reports are to be believed in they appear to be excellent reporting there's a lot of tapes of a lot of girls God knows how many of them are underage so and apparently he is under investigation go go go grab those taste before he destroys them and in the way that she was mentally and physically abused according to her allegations is gross let alone the underage sex which is horrific help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm /join
