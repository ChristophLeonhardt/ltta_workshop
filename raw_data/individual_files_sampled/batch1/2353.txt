well the first thing that I do when I'm presenting a speech is I ask myself you know what's the message could I write it in ten words that's step number one number two is what's my title because before you get on stage there will be somebody who introduces you and your presentation title now if you're doing a PowerPoint presentation your title will probably be on the PowerPoint slide now here's the trick if your title tells the audience what you are going to talk about you have a bigger chance of losing the audience but if your title creates curiosity now you've won the audience all step number three is basically how can I grab the attention of the audience first 45 seconds can i frame my problem can I frame it in an innovative way that's that's my step number three step number four is what are my five main points and in all of my speeches and presentations I don't go beyond five my optimum and this is what I recommend you is to have three main points in your speech or your presentation and finally how am I going to end it because I want to end it on a high because of a thing called the principle of recency the principle recency is that people remember first what they hear last so I want to end on a high and I want to make that impactful so that's that's my process
