AN INTERESTING PART OF OF THI SEE WHAT COMES OF IT. AN INTERESTING PART OF OF THE I DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TONIGHT'S LEGAL EAGLES TO REACT TO ALL OF THE KAVANAUGH NEWS. PRESIDENT OF A LION FOR JUDGES AND THE CHIEF COUNSEL FOR JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK, CARRIE SEVERINO. THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THOSE THAT ARE COMMITTEE TALKS WITH MAN THAT SAYS IT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE. I DON'T MAKE MUCH OF IT, FRANKLY. THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT HAVE BEEN GATHERED DURING AN FBI INVESTIGATION. I ASSUME IT WAS REPUBLICAN SENATORS ON THE PHONE WITH SOMEONE. Shannon: WHAT MAN WOULD TURN HIMSELF IN? IT'S VERY REMINISCENT OF A STORY WE HEARD VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE, JUST LAST WEEK, WHEN ED WHELAN BLAMED SOME OTHER GUY FOR COMMITTING THE ASSAULT. Shannon: CARRIE, WHAT MAN WOULD COME FORWARD AND EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO THIS KIND OF CRIMINAL ACCUSATION? THERE ARE SO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT BECAUSE WITHOUT A LOT OF STUFF TO RUN, ALLEGATIONS BEING MADE EARLIER TODAY, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT I THINK, 1982, THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WOULD HAVE PASSED ON THAT. WHO KNOWS. I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE. MAYBE TOMORROW. HOPEFULLY WE'LL LEARN MORE. Shannon: VERY INTERESTING. ONE THING WE DO KNOW, THEY WILL ASK HER, REPUBLICANS WILL CERTAINLY ASK DR. BLASEY FORD ABOUT THIS AND I ASSUME SHE WILL HAVE A VERY MEASURED, CREDIBLE ANSWER. IT GOES TO WHETHER SHE IS RUBBER AGAIN CORRECTLY, WHICH IS THE CRUX. Shannon: IF THIS IS A SWORN STATEMENT AND WHETHER HIS NAME GOES PUBLIC, IT WILL BE INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT TO SEE HOW SHE REACT TO THIS. I THINK WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM HER. YOU HEARD FROM THE POLYGRAPH EXPERT THAT WE HAD WITH HER AND HIS ACCOUNT OF WHAT SHE TOLD HIM. HE STUCK TO HER, THE COMMITTEE HASN'T. WE'LL HEAR FROM HER TOMORROW. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT. THIS IS WHAT G.O.P. SENATOR KENNEDY WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE SAID ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO GO TOMORROW. WE HAVE NO PLANS WHATSOEVER MOMENTS ORACLE CATWOMAN OR THATA TO TRY TO HAVE ANY GOT YOUR MOMENTS ORACLE CATWOMAN OR THATN ON ANYBODY IN THE PURPOSE OF THIS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO ALLOW DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO TELL THEIR STORIES THEIR STORIES. Shannon: HER TEAM NEGOTIATED TO TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THEY'VE ARRIVED AT THIS. DO YOU FEEL IT WILL BE A FAIR PROCESS? ARE YOU SATISFIED WE'LL HEAR FROM EVERYBODY AND HEAR BOTH SIDES? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I DO THINK THAT SHE WILL PROVIDE A VERY SERIOUS, COMPELLING, POWERFUL, CREDIBLE STORY TOMORROW. BUT DO I THINK THE PROCESS HAS BEEN FAIR? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Shannon: WILL TOMORROW BE FAIR? I THINK IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. HOWEVER, IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE ALREADY VILIFIED AND BULLIED HER. EVEN BEFORE THEY HAVE HEARD HER COMMENTS TOMORROW. IT'S LIKE 27 YEARS AGO WITH ANITA HILL. Shannon: HOW ARE THEY PULLING HER? LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS ALREADY TRIED TO DISCREDIT HER STORY. ORRIN HATCH, WHO WAS THERE 27 YEARS AGO WITH ANITA HILL, HAS SAID THAT SHE MADE UP HER STORY. Shannon: HOW DO YOU THINK THAT CONTRASTS WITH THE DEMOCRATS WHO ALREADY FOUND HIM GUILTY WITHOUT HEARING FROM THE TWO OF THEM? I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN SAYING THIS STORY DOESN'T ADD UP AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS SAYING SHE'S MAKING THE STUFF UP. I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 30 SOME YEARS AGO, AND MEMORIES GO TO BEEN CONFUSED, GOOD FAITH, SO I DO THINK SHE THIS WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES. I'M EXCITED TO HEAR THAT IT WON'T JUST BE 21 DIFFERENT SENATORS QUESTIONING. I WISH BOTH SIDES HAD GONE THE ROUTE OF HAVING AN EXPERIENCED PERSON HAVE A COHERENT PLAN OF QUESTIONING. I THINK IT WILL BE VERY VALUABLE TO FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO GO THROUGH THIS. NO, THIS HAS NOT BEEN A FAIR PROCESS. THE FAIR PROCESS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO FOLLOW THE REGULAR ORDER LIKE SENATOR FEINSTEIN DID NOT DO MUCH AGO FOR A CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD HAVE PROTECTED DR. FORD, JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S REPUTATION, WE DIDN'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD. UNFORTUNATELY EVERY ONE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS EVEN AFTER PEOPLE SAID, LET'S HAVE THE FBI INVESTIGATED, EACH NEW ALLEGATION, THEY PUSHED TO THE MEDIA. Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU REALLY QUICKLY, YOUR GROUP HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS NOMINATION, AND THERE WERE ARTICLES SUGGESTING THAT YOU WERE BACKING OFF. THEY TOOK ONE LINE OUT OF THE INTERVIEW OUT OF CONTEXT. I SPENT THE WHOLE INTERVIEW DEFENDING KAVANAUGH. WE STAND FIRMLY BEHIND JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE HEARING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONFIRMATION. Shannon: WE KNOW YOUR GROUP HAS SPENT A LOT OF HER AS.
