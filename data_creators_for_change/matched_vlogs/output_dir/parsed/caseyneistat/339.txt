nobody wants to sit next to a screaming
baby so it's pretty easy
welcome to the Saturday edition of the
vlog today will be a travel episode okay
what else going down this tunnel in the
future is a lot more fun on a skateboard
apple juice orange juice box here you
don't squeeze it don't spill that
do you know when I call Hershey's Kisses
why because the sound the chocolate
makes when it's pushed out of the thingy
it's like this baby headphones
those Hennis they come Francine
so we are going to Texas we're going to
Houston Texas for a less than 24 hour
long trip it's a family thing Candace's
grandmother passed away one year ago so
we go back in it it's a family issue
quick trip though
we made it on the plane we don't have
the correct seat so we're gonna have to
two people from their seats no big deal
forty minutes later we are still sitting
on the runway I have not moved
there are clowns sure on how long they
intimated not only Hatton our Father
now been on the runway for over an hour
I don't know how much long as the last
and we still have like a three hour
almost a four hour flight ahead of us
but baby's freaking out Candice is
freaking out I'm freaking out it's not
Jeff Lou's fault there's a I guess
weather or something we can't take off I
mean this would suck generally but with
the baby it really says go back to the
gate right here I do pologize I'm
profusely for this latest delay we're
back at the gate all hell has broken
loose now everybody standing up the
pilots have to switch to live it on the
plane for too long but it seems kind of
a champ though we just keep giving her
more sweets Candice on the other hand
we're on the plane for three hours even
now we're getting off the plane
we traveled nowhere
so Jeff Jeff do give us some free food
vouchers thanks Jeff blue probably
includes alcohol we're getting some
snacks for part two of the play
Candace Evans and wine franzine is just
chilling
still here no change they told us 15
minutes we've been gone for 40 minutes
it doesn't look like they've boarded yet
daddy will open these for you we're
giving up we're throwing in
Chemical Francine
pity Markos we're throwing in the towel
we're going back home we spent the whole
day here at the airport well it was
nobody's fault I guess is the nice way
to say but we are not going to Texas
you're not upset about not seeing my
sister I
you want me to take Francine when you
fly out
that's it mission aborted getting in the
car driving back to the city
you know these things happen you can't
be upset I mean it sucks but it was the
weather's fall it's not like there's
anybody to blame these are just sort of
the pitfalls of life at the end of the
day we still had a fun day with the baby
running around eating junk food you know
it could have been worse
you know what I just realized Candace we
went literally the entire day without
being outside except when we walked to
him from the car the whole day
I'm a miserable human being and that's I
can be outside for at least some portion
of my day especially in this
