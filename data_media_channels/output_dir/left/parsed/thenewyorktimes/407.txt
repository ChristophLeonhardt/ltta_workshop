If I have to describe the feeling when
I fly, it's a connection with the wind.
It's very peaceful, it's very quiet.
It's a kind of connection with nature.
You don't have any choice to
go out if there are problems.
So, you have to check
if the condition is good,
because once you are up,
there's no way out.
