INSIGHT AS TO WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,358
MY DAY THAT I WAS AT THE POLICE 

37
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,826
DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS IN 

38
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,762
COCONUT CREEK WHEN THE CALL CAME

39
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,496
OUT.

40
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,897
I DECIDED TO COME OVER AND HELP 

41
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,800
IN ANY WAY THAT I COULD.

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,468
WHEN I ARRIVED TO THE AREA THERE

43
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:45,371
WAS A HEAVY PRESENCE OF 

44
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,739
OFFICERS, EMERGENCY PERSONNEL 

45
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,042
AND I DECIDED TO EXPAND MY 

46
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,277
SEARCH FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT 

47
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,013
WAS STILL ON THE LOOSE.

48
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:54,947
WE HAD BEEN GIVEN INFORMATION 

49
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,418
VIA THE RADIO AS TO WHAT HE HAD 

50
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,419
BEEN WEARING.

51
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,720
THIS INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED 

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,024
THROUGH THE RADIO DISPATCH.

53
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,760
I DECIDED TO TRAVEL TO SOME OF 

54
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,797
THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS LOCATED 

55
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,533
NEAR THE SCHOOL.

56
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,100
AND AS I TRAVELED DOWN ONE OF 

57
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,536
THE BACK ROADS, IT'S A HEAVILY 

58
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:20,006
RESIDENTIAL AREA, I HAPPENED TO 

59
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,341
COME ACROSS, JUST MYSELF -- NOT 

60
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,043
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT, COUPLE OF 

61
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,247
PEOPLE WALKING DOGS IN THE AREA.

62
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,483
AS I CONTINUED DOWN THIS 

63
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,583
ROADWAY, I DISCOVERED AN 

64
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,788
INDIVIDUAL WALKING ON THE 

65
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:36,922
SIDEWALK THAT WAS WEARING THE 

66
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,691
CLOTHING DESCRIPTION THAT HAD 

67
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:43,997
BEEN GIVEN OVER THE RADIO.

68
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,265
HE LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL HIGH 

69
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,700
SCHOOL STUDENT.

70
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,937
AND FOR A QUICK MOMENT, I 

71
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,873
THOUGHT COULD THIS BE THE 

72
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:58,377
PERSON -- IS THIS WHO I NEED TO 

73
00:02:58,377 --> 00:02:59,479
STOP?

74
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,914
TRAINING KICKED IN AND I PULLED 

75
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:06,118
MY VEHICLE OVER IMMEDIATELY AND 

76
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,655
ENGAGED THE SUSPECT.

78
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:17,863
WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY WITHOUT 

79
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,900
ANY -- ANY ISSUES.

80
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,001
>> DID HE HAVE A WEAPON WITH 

81
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:22,368
HIM?

82
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,004
>> I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT.

83
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,472
THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL 

84
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:26,773
ONGOING.

85
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,641
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME RIGHT 

86
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,844

IT WAS SOME HOUR OR SO BEFORE HE

191
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,103

206
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,128
THE PUBLIC DEFENDER ALSO TALKED 

207
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,531
ABOUT A HISTORY OF MENTAL

HE TALKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE, 

210
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,169
POSSIBLE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM AND

211
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,804
THAT WOULD BE LOOKED INTO.

212
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,938
COURT ACKNOWLEDGED THERE COULD 

213
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:56,576

00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,914
COMMUNICATED PERHAPS GIVEN SOME 

218
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,349
SORT OF STATEMENT TO

AUTHORITIES.

220
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,417
ALL HE DID IN COURT WAS 

221
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,685
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IN FACT 

222
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,220

WATCHING STUDENTS DROP NEXT TO 

241
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,559
THEM IN THOSE CLASSROOMS.

242
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,295
I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS I BRING IN

243
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,430
OUR CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT,

244
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,766
PIERRE, THESE STUDENTS YOUNG 

245
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,133

00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,505
WEAPONS SAYING THAT OUR 

249
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,407
LAWMAKERS IN WASHINGTON AND THEY

250
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,442
WERE -- VERY STRONG WITH THEIR 

251
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,677
OPINIONS, THESE STUDENTS SAYING 

252
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,011
OUR SCHOOL IS JUST THE LATEST 

253
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:08,381
SCHOOL AND NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT'S

254
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,082
LIKE AND THEY HAVE EXPECTATIONS 

255
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,517
THAT SOMETHING, SOMETHING WILL 

256
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,152
BE DONE TO TRY TO KEEP THE 

257
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:13,953
SHOOTINGS FROM HAPPENING AND 

258
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,554
YOU'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE 

259
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:19,325
WEAPON AND HE DID FIND THAT 

260
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,926
WEAPON, PURCHASE IT LEGALLY. 

261
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,161
>> THAT'S RIGHT, DAVID.

262
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,962
HE BOUGHT THIS WEAPON LEGALLY 

263
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,699
FROM A FEDERAL LICENSED GUN 

264
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,300
DEALER, PASSED WITH FLYING 

265
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,533
COLORS.

266
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,168
THE GUN DEALER WE'RE BEING TOLD 

267
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,937
DID EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK.

268
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,739
NOTHING IN HIS RECORD INDICATED 

269
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,041
THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A THREAT

270
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,709
IN TERMS OF A CRIMINAL RECORD AT

271
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,076
THAT POINT.

272
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,011
BUT DAVID, AS YOU POINT OUT, ALL

273
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,479
OF THESE DIFFERENT RED FLAGS 

274
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,047
THAT WERE KNOWN TO PEOPLE, 

275
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,417
STUDENTS TALKING ABOUT HIM 

276
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,584
TALKING ABOUT VIOLENCE.

277
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,852
WE HEARD THE SUPERINTENDENT 

278
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,387
TODAY DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT 

279
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,189
HE WAS A PERSON WHO HAD ISSUES 

280
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,525
AND WHO HAD BEEN GETTING SUPPORT

281
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,492
AND COUNSELING.

282
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,428
AND THE FBI TODAY ACKNOWLEDGED 

283
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,565
THAT THERE WAS A YOUTUBE POSTING

284
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,166
THEY WERE MADE AWARE OF WHERE 

285
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,202
THE SUSPECT OR SOMEONE WITH A 

286
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,369
NAME LIKE HIS, THE NOTION THAT 

287
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,172
HE WANTED TO A PROFESSIONAL 

288
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,039
SCHOOL SHOOTER.

289
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,507
THE FBI SAID THEY COULD NOT 

290
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,809
IDENTIFY HIM, DAVID.

291
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,677
AND DID NOT TAKE ADDITIONAL 

292
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,412
ACTION AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

293
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,580
BUT CLEARLY, THOSE STUDENTS 

294
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,615
UNDERSTOOD THAT WE'RE SEEING 

295
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,718
MORE AND MORE OF THESE KINDS OF 

296
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:20,886
INCIDENTS, STRIKING THEY KNEW 

297
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,223
WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF RUN, 

298
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,493
HIDE, SEEK SUPPORT, IT'S 

299
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,027
REMARKABLE.

300
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,162
>> NOT ONLY IS IT STRIKING 

301
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,264
PIERRE, IT'S ALSO A SIGN OF THE 

302
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,833
TIMES AND STUDENTS TALKED ABOUT 

303
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,033
THAT.

304
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,401
THEY KNEW THEY HAD A FIRE DRILL 

305
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,170
WHEN THIS ALARM WENT OFF THEY 

306
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,304
THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD 

307
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:42,174
ABOUT THAT BUT THEY HAD BEEN 

308
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,943
TRAINED WHAT A CODE RED WAS.

309
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,378
THAT'S WHAT THEY HEARD FROM 

310
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:46,978
AUTHORITIES AFTER THE SECOND 

311
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:48,547
ALARM WAS FLIPPED OFF.

312
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,782
NOW THEY SUSPECT THAT THE 

313
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,749
SUSPECT IT'S BELIEVED ACTUALLY 

314
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,585
SET OFF THE SECOND ALARM LATE IN

315
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,886
THE AFTERNOON TO GET PEOPLE IN 

316
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,987
THE HALLWAYS SO HE COULD TAKE 

317
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:56,188
AIM.

318
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,656
A STAGGERING NUMBER.

319
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,191
THIS WAS THE 18th SCHOOL 

320
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,959
SHOOTING BY ONE COUNT AT A 

321
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,463
SCHOOL JUST THIS YEAR AND O

322
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,798
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY 

323
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,499
THROUGH FEBRUARY.

324
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,900
WE'LL HAVE TEAM COVERAGE TONIGHT

BREAK BACK ON IF WE LEARN 

327
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,437
ANYTHING MORE FROM THE SHERIFF 

328
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:15,307
ABOUT THE TIME LINE AND PEOPLE 

329
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,108
STILL AT THE HOSPITAL IN THIS 

330
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,576
COMMUNITY FIGHTING FOR THEIR

LIVES.

00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:22,348
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M DAVID MUIR,
