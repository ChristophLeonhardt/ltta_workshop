1
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,775
STOCKS ARE MIXED AS CRUDE OIL

2
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,044
DROPS MORE THAN 3%.

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,013
THE QUESTION IS, "WHAT'D YOU

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:14,981
MISS?"

5
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:18,018
SCARLET: A CLOSELY WATCHED

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,587
SPEECH THIS WEEK BY JANET

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:20,987
YELLEN.

8
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:25,158
JOE: JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER

9
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,126
MAKES AN EPIC OLYMPIC APPEARANCE

10
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:32,298
AS SUPER MARIO.

11
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,267
MATT: AND WE DISCUSS WHAT YOU

12
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,368
MISSED IN TODAY'S $14 BILLION

13
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,102
DEAL MADE BY PFIZER.

14
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,038
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH OUR

15
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:43,777
MARKET MINUTE.

16
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,510
A MODEST MOVE IN THE MAJOR

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,278
INDEXES WHEN ALL IS SAID AND

18
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,147
DONE.

19
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,350
THE BIG STORY HAS TO BE OIL

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,750
PRICES.

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,517
OIL DECLINING FOR THE FIRST TIME

22
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:54,454
IN EIGHT DAYS, THE LONGEST

23
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,288
WINNING STREAK IN MONTHS, IF NOT

24
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,825
YEARS.

25
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:00,660
ENTERING A BULL MARKET BEFORE

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,297
GAVE WAY TO SOME PROFIT MAKING

27
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:04,697
TODAY.

28
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,232
SOME MODEST MOVES.

29
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:11,504
JOE: MODEST IS THE WORD OF THE

30
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,305
DAY AND PROBABLY THE WORD OF THE

31
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:12,639
MONTH.

32
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,408
MATT: I LOOKED TO MEASURE ON

33
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,543
STOCKS AND I SAW THAT HALF A

34
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:21,114
PERCENT WAS THE WIDEST RANGE,

35
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,483
THE NASDAQ AND THE DOW'S 1.5%.

36
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:28,855
TAKE A LOOK AT MY IMAP, THE MOST

37
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:29,722
BASIC FUNCTION TO USE TO SEE HOW

38
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,392
THE INDUSTRY MOVES ARE GOING

39
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,593
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

40
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:38,465
YOU CAN SEE A TOTALLY DEFENSIVE

41
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,500
INVESTOR.

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,874
UTILITY THE BIGGEST GAINER, THEN

43
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:48,608
HEALTH CARE, THEN CONSUMER

44
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:48,975
STAPLES.

45
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:49,709
OIL STOCKS WERE DOWN AND

46
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,910
CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY STOCKS

47
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,946
WERE DOWN AGAIN AS WELL.

48
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,780
SO PEOPLE WERE GETTING DEFENSIVE

49
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,514
IN TODAY'S MARKET.

50
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:58,551
JOE: ON THE GOVERNMENT BOND

51
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:04,691
MARKET, THE INDIAN TENURE DEAL

52
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,626
JUMPING, SOME NERVOUSNESS IN

53
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:12,498
INDIAN MARKETS.

54
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,366
ANY TRANSITION OF POWER IS GOING

55
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,769
TO CAUSE A LITTLE AGITATION.

56
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,006
SCARLET: THAT STICK WITH

57
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:24,077
EMERGING MARKETS HERE.

58
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:24,944
SEEING THE BIGGEST DROP IN ABOUT

59
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,148
A MONTH.

60
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,916
THE RUSSIAN RUBLE LEADING THE

61
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,484
SLIDE.

62
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,719
THE UP ARROW IS THE DOLLAR

63
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,021
VERSUS THE RUBLE AS THE OIL

64
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:35,822
PRICES DROP FOR THE FIRST TIME

65
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,924
IN EIGHT DAYS.

66
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,892
FITCH CUT ITS OUTLOOK ON

67
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,461
TURKEY'S CREDIT RATING SAYING IT

68
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,697
INCREASES THE LEGAL RISK OF

69
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,331
INVESTING IN TURKEY.

70
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,936
JOE: GOLD AND SILVER GETTING HIT

71
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,707
TODAY, SILVER REALLY GETTING

72
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,108
SLAMMED.

73
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:55,808
PERHAPS SOME OF THAT WAS THE

74
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:59,178
SELLOFF THAT WAS PERCEIVED TO BE

75
00:02:59,178 --> 00:02:59,879
THE HAWKISHNESS OF THOSE

76
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,549
COMMENTS FROM STANLEY FISCHER.

77
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,416
ONE COMMODITY GETTING A BOUNCE

78
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,652
TODAY WAS NATURAL GAS.

79
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,388
ONE LAST HEATWAVE, YOU CAN SEE

80
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,122
RIGHT THERE A BIT OF A RALLY

81
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:09,489
TODAY.

82
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,360
SCARLET: LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE

83
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,128
INTO THE BLOOMBERG AND YOU CAN

84
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,530
FIND ALL THE CHARTS USING THE

85
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,364
FUNCTION AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR

86
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:23,702
SCREEN.

87
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:26,239
WE WILL STICK WITH THE IDEA THAT

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,039
OIL PRICES HAVE GIVEN BACK FROM

89
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,710
THEIR RECENT GAINS.

90
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,380
YOU NOTICE THIS COLUMN, THIS IS

91
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,583
SEPTEMBER.

92
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,450
OIL TENDS TO DROP IN THE MONTH

93
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,950
OF SEPTEMBER.

94
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,785
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT'S

95
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,754
BEEN THE CONSISTENT PATTERN.

96
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,790
IN 2015 CRUDE OIL DROP MORE THAN

97
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,157
8%.

98
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,592
2013, ABOUT 5%.

99
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,495
THESE ARE PRETTY SIZABLE LOSSES.

100
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:55,034
JOE: SO AN OMINOUS WARNING AFTER

101
00:03:55,034 --> 00:04:00,906
THIS EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT.

102
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,942
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STOCK

103
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:03,810
MARKET TODAY BECAUSE IT'S KIND

104
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,812
OF AN INTERESTING DAY.

105
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,816
IT'S REALLY JERKY.

106
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,886
MATT: HOW DID YOU DO THIS?

107
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:21,560
JOE: YOU SEE THESE REALLY SHARP

108
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,094
UPS AND DOWNS.

109
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:22,862
ON THE LEFT SIDE YOU SEE THIS IS

110
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:23,629
VOLUME DISTRIBUTION, THIS IS THE

111
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,297
VOLUME ANALYSIS FUNCTION.

112
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,865
YOU CAN SEE IT'S CONCENTRATED AT

113
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:32,338
A FEW PRICES BASICALLY HERE,

114
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,105
HERE, AND A LITTLE BIT HERE.

115
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:33,806
YOU GET THE POINT THERE WERE

116
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,008
JUST A FEW PRICES AND THEN YOU

117
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:38,144
HAVE THESE BIG GAPS WHERE THERE

118
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,113
IS ALMOST NO VOLUME IT ALL.

119
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,549
SO IT'S KIND OF A JERKY, SLOW,

120
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,016
SUMMER DAY.

121
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,017
ULTIMATELY NOT MUCH CHANGE BUT

122
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,920
THE CHANGES THAT DID HAPPEN

123
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,721
HAPPENED THAT NO VOLUME AND VERY

124
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:56,428
FAST.

125
00:04:56,428 --> 00:05:00,666
MATT: I HAVE A GREAT CHART THAT

126
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,402
I STOLE FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

127
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,070
WHAT IT SHOWS YOU IS COMPANY

128
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,775
SPENDING ON R&D, CAPITAL

129
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:10,610
EXPENDITURES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

130
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,178
R&D IS THE RED COLUMN AND YOU

131
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,214
CAN SEE IT HAS GOTTEN BIGGER

132
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,550
EACH QUARTER GOING BACK TO THE

133
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,786
BEGINNING OF 2014.

134
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,586
AT THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

135
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,457
HAVE DROPPED TO ALMOST NIL.

136
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,926
WE KNOW THAT CAPITAL

137
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,627
EXPENDITURES ARE PROBABLY

138
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,361
BECAUSE COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

139
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,496
CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMIC

140
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,400
FUTURE, BUT THE R&D EXPENDITURE

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,034
IS GROWING.

142
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:35,902
I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING.

143
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,404
IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

144
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,140
THE TAX TREATMENT ON R&D.

145
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,908
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WOULD BE

146
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,510
PUTTING MORE INTO THAT.

147
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,344
PROFIT MARGINS GOT BIGGER OVER

148
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,078
THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS IN

149
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,013
THIS CHART.

150
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,813
THEY ARE STARTING TO SHRINK A

151
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,582
LITTLE BIT.

152
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,750
A LOT OF PRESSURE ON PROFIT

153
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,521
MARGINS, BUT THEY'RE STILL

154
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,690
GROWING R&D, WHICH IS

155
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,760
INTERESTING.

156
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,630
JOE: YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CHART

157
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,131
THAT IS THAT.

158
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:14,774
SCARLET: THERE HAS BEEN SOME

159
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,474
CONCERN OR AT LEAST PEOPLE

160
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,275
NOTICING THE RECENT SURGE IN THE

161
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:21,814
STRAIT BETWEEN LIBOR -- WITH US

162
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,782
IS BOB FINCH.

163
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,584
WHEN SOMEONE TALKS ABOUT LIBOR,

164
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,487
WHAT COMES UP IS THAT THIS IS

165
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,321
ANTICIPATION BEFORE THE MONEY

166
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,857
MARKET REFORM KICKS IN.

167
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,891
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPREAD,

168
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,692
WHY ARE PEOPLE TAKING A SECOND

169
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,093
LOOK AT IT AND WONDERING IF THIS

170
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:38,264
COULD BE CONCERNING?

171
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,131
>> WHEN YOU SEE SPREADS BETWEEN

172
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:42,902
BANK ORIENTED PAPER AND TREASURY

173
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,738
BILLS, YOU HEARKEN BACK TO THE

174
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,776
2007 FINANCIAL CRISIS.

175
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,543
IS THERE SOME SORT OF RISK

176
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,344
BREWING UP THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE

177
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,914
OF?

178
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,748
AND CONCERNS THAT THAT IS WHAT

179
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,549
THE MARKET IS BEGINNING TO TELL

180
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:56,849
US.

181
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,887
IN THIS CASE IS MORE INNOCUOUS.

182
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,687
OCTOBER 14 THERE IS A MAJOR

183
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,521
REFORM GOING ON FOR MONEY MARKET

184
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:06,692
LINES.

185
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,493
THE INDUSTRY IS CREATING MORE

186
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,462
VOLATILITY IN THE NET ASSET

187
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:14,500
VALUE AND ALSO SOME GAINS THAT

188
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,403
SLOWDOWN REDEMPTIONS IN CHARGE

189
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,438
REDEMPTION FEES IN CASE THERE'S

190
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,007
A RUN ON THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

191
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:21,707
THIS IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE

192
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,708
LIQUIDITY.

193
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,510
WHAT HAS LED TO IS A LOT OF

194
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,479
COMPANIES, MAJOR BROKERAGE

195
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,114
FIRMS, RETAIL ORIENTED, RICK

196
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,651
WEARING THEIR CUSTOMERS TO SHIFT

197
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,418
OUT OF WHAT WOULD BE CALLED A

198
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,419
PRIME MONEY MARKET FUND THAT

199
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,624
WOULD INCLUDE CDS, COMMERCIAL

200
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,425
PAPER, AND MOVE INSTEAD INTO

201
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:45,797
GOVERNMENT ONLY FUNDS.

202
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,967
THERE MAY BE A BENIGN EXPIRATION

203
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,768
FOR THE SHIFT, BUT WILL IT HAVE

204
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,370
ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS FOR LOANS

205
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,739
AND OTHER THINGS TIED TO LIBOR?

206
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:58,377
EVEN IF THERE'S A BENIGN

207
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,145
EXPLANATION, WILL IT FILTER

208
00:07:59,145 --> 00:07:59,879
THROUGH TO THE ECONOMY IN A

209
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,746
NEGATIVE WAY?

210
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,715
>> YOU HAVE A $400 BILLION

211
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,285
SHIPPED FROM PRIME MONEY MARKET

212
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:06,986
FUNDS TO GOVERNMENT FUNDS.

213
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,656
AS A RESULT THE DEMAND FOR

214
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:15,761
T-BILLS HAS GONE UP IN THE

215
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,595
DEMAND FOR LIBOR-BASED PRODUCTS

216
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:17,396
HAS GONE DOWN AND THE SPREAD HAS

217
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,164
WIDENED ABOUT 30 BASIS POINTS.

218
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,964
IS THAT BECAUSE LIBOR WENT UP 30

219
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:23,503
BASIS POINTS OR T-BILLS WENT

220
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,336
DOWN 30 BASIS POINTS, OR IS IT

221
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,104
SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO?

222
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:30,009
MY GUESS IT IS A COMMENDATION OF

223
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,578
THE TWO.

224
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:37,850
MAYBE LIBOR IS OVERSTATED.

225
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,650
I CANNOT BELIEVE 10-15 BASIS

226
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,452
POINTS IS GOING TO HAVE A MACRO

227
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:44,123
EFFECT ANYWHERE IN THE ECONOMY.

228
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:44,790
I THINK IT IS SMALL, BUT

229
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,994
SOMETIMES YOU JUST READ

230
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:49,762
SIMPLISTIC MEASURES LIKE THE

231
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,597
WIDENING SPREAD AND SAY THERE'S

232
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,331
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING OUT

233
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,535
THERE, THERE ARE LIQUIDITY

234
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,236
STRAINS ON THE ECONOMY.

235
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,404
I THINK THIS IS EASILY EXPLAINED

236
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:04,343
BY REFORM PROCESS.

237
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:09,515
JOE: I FIND THAT SHIP THE MOST

238
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:09,982
INTERESTING.

239
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:10,850
IS THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING

240
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,686
INTO GOVERNMENT FUNDS, OR IS IT

241
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,553
BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING OUT OF

242
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:15,488
PRIME MONEY MARKET LINES?

243
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,056
THE LATTER COULD BE BECAUSE OF

244
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:22,528
CHANGES IN THE WAY THEY ARE

245
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,362
REGULATED, MAYBE INVESTORS HAVE

246
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,764
LESS TRUST IN RUN MONEY MARKET

247
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,566
FUNDS IN THE HAVE IN THE PAST.

248
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,635
>> I THINK IT IS BOTH, AND I

249
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,503
THINK IT'S REALLY NOT A CHOICE

250
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,571
BACK HER.

251
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,440
I BROKERAGE ACCOUNT AT A MAJOR

252
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,108
DISCOUNT FIRM REQUIRED ME TO

253
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:40,312
TAKE MY SWEEP ACCOUNT FOR MY

254
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:41,080
BROKERAGE ACCOUNT FROM PRIME

255
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,882
FUND TO A GOVERNMENT FUND.

256
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,649
ALL THE BIG RETAIL BROKERAGE

257
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,687
FUNDS ARE THE CHRIST TO DO THAT.

258
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,957
THIS IS NOT A CHOICE VARIABLE,

259
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:52,792
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE

260
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,094
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

261
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,961
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO SHIFT

262
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:56,729
FROM PRIME FUNDS TO GOVERNMENT

263
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,898
ONCE.

264
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,665
LUCKILY T-BILL ISSUANCES

265
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:05,237
CREEPING HIGHER.

266
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,606
I DO THINK THIS IS A REGULATORY

267
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,841
ISSUE, AND AGAIN IT'S NOT THAT

268
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,710
INDIVIDUALS ARE MAKING A

269
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,478
CONSCIOUS DECISION.

270
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,412
I RECEIVED A NOTICE SAYING YOU

271
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,681
HAVE NO CHOICE.

272
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,818
MATT: YOU CAN SEE THAT THE

273
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:26,091
REGULATION WENT INTO EFFECT IN

274
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:26,592
DECEMBER 2015.

275
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,359
THERE IS A DROP IN PRIME MONEY

276
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:27,993
MARKET FUNDS THERE AND A

277
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:28,694
COINCIDING JOB IN GOVERNMENT

278
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,028
FUNDS.

279
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:34,467
SCARLET: IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD

280
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,134
METRIC OR INDICATOR OF

281
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:35,601
LIQUIDITY.

282
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,368
WHAT WOULD YOU LOOK AT TO GET A

283
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:39,038
SENSE OF THE LIQUIDITY CRUNCH IF

284
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,007
YOU CANNOT USE THIS METRIC?

285
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:47,013
>> THERE ARE OTHER MARKETS OTHER

286
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,948
THAN TREASURY BILLS TO YOU CAN

287
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:49,648
LOOK AT COMMERCIAL PAPER,

288
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,550
INTERNATIONAL DOLLAR MARKETS.

289
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,351
THE SPREAD BETWEEN LIBOR AND

290
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,320
COMMERCIAL PAPER RATES IS

291
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,389
UNCHANGED THIS YEAR.

292
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,289
IT'S THREE BASIS POINTS THROUGH

293
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,761
COMMERCIAL PAPER.

294
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,595
BASICALLY THE OTHER MARKETS IT

295
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,229
MIGHT SHOW SOME CHANGE

296
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,997
RELATIONSHIP TO LIBOR IN FACT

297
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,767
HAVE NOT DONE THAT AT ALL.

298
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:09,568
IN THAT CONTEXT, IT TELLS ME

299
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,137
THAT THIS IS MORE THAN ANYTHING

300
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,305
ELSE A BIG DEMAND FOR T-BILLS,

301
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,008
WHICH IS ARTIFICIALLY DEPRESSED

302
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,809
T-BILL RATE AND MAY PUSH UP THE

303
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,346
OTHER GREAT IS ALL THE PRIMARY

304
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,047
-- PRIME MONEY MARKET FUNDS HAVE

305
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,282
BEEN FORCED TO LIQUIDATE SOME

306
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:23,949
POSITIONS.

307
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:24,817
WHAT IS INTERESTING ALSO IS THAT

308
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,618
THE MARKET TENDS TO EQUALIZE IT

309
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,385
SELF.

310
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:30,723
INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES SEEING

311
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,791
MONEY MARKET FINDS HAVING TO

312
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,625
DUMP THEIR LIBOR AND COMMERCIAL

313
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,793
PAPER ASSETS SEE THOSE RATES GO

314
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,862
UP LITTLE BIT.

315
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,696
THE COMPANIES HAVE PROBABLY BEEN

316
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,267
PUTTING MONEY DIRECTLY INTO THAT

317
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,067
PAPER BECAUSE THEY CAN GET A

318
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:42,635
BETTER YIELD ON IT.

319
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,604
I THINK THE MARKET IS WORKING

320
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,206
AND GIVEN THE $400 BILLION

321
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:47,973
SHIPPED, SPREAD WIDENING IS

322
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,774
ACTUALLY PRETTY SMALL.

323
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,812
MATT: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

324
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,115
CURRENCIES.

325
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:56,882
WHEN I HEAR YOUR NAME, I THINK

326
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,616
ABOUT CURRENCIES FOR SOME

327
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,419
REASON.

328
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,254
THERE ARE 94,000 SHORT CONTRACTS

329
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,958
OPEN WITH POUNDS.

330
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,662
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS

331
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,462
POSITIONING RIGHT NOW AND WHAT

332
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:11,163
CAN IT MEAN FOR MOVES GOING

333
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,465
FORWARD?

334
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,332
>> IT'S POTENTIALLY A PAINFUL

335
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,268
POSITION.

336
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,169
WE'VE SEEN THE POUND PER COUPLE

337
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,103
OF IT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

338
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,005
DAYS.

339
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,007
THE TRADE WEIGHTED COUNT WAS

340
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,008
DOWN ABOUT 7% BEFORE THE BREXIT

341
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,879
VOTE AND DOWN ABOUT ANOTHER 8%

342
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,480
AFTERWARDS.

343
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,314
THE TRADE WEIGHTED COUNT IS DOWN

344
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,250
15% THIS YEAR.

345
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,254
THE CURRENCY IS GETTING INTO AN

346
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:47,599
UNDERVALUED TERRITORY.

347
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,235
I WOULD TEND TO DISAGREE, I

348
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,671
THINK 130 IS THE LOW LEVEL AND

349
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:53,472
WE COULD SEE SOME SQUEEZE HIGHER

350
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,373
IN THE NEAR TERM.

351
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,644

00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,126
SPACE OR SHOULD WE JUST ASSUME

358
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,562
YES AND ASK WHAT ARE THE

359
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,763
TARGETS?

MEDIVATION FOR A PRICE TAG OF

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,434
$14 BILLION.

408
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:23,709
THE DEAL GIVES -- WHERE CAN THE

409
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,510
PARIS-BASED COMPANY GO TO MOVE

410
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,015
ALL THAT M&A CASH?

411
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,683
LET'S PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE

412
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,152
FIRST.

413
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,021
PFIZER IS BUYING MEDIVATION.

414
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,091
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT CANCER.

415
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,193
THIS HAS BEEN A HOT YEAR, GOING

416
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,027
BACK TO LAST YEAR IT'S BEEN A

417
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:47,232
HOT TIME TO BUY ONCOLOGY DRUGS.

418
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,100
THEY'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP A

419
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,867
BREAST CANCER DRUG AND A BLOOD

420
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,902
CANCER DRUG.

421
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,172
SO YOU HAVE CURRENT ASSETS THAT

422
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:57,643
WILL BREW OF CASH RIGHT NOW AND

423
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,410
SOMETHING COMING IN THE NEXT

424
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,513
COUPLE OF YEARS THAT HAS VALUE.

425
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,248
THEY STARTED THE PROCESS BACK IN

426
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:03,615
MARCH.

427
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,251
THEY PLAYED IT BADLY.

428
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,553
I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF

429
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,154
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS GOING ON

430
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:13,425
RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THEIR BANKERS

431
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,293
BECAUSE THEY NEVER SAW THIS

432
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,929
COMPANY BEING WORTH $14 BILLION.

433
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,796
I THINK THEY ASSUMED IT WAS LIKE

434
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,767
A $12 BILLION DEAL AT MOST.

435
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,636
THEY WERE ADVISED WAY BACK TO

436
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,438
BUMP THEIR BID BECAUSE THEY

437
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,207
STARTED OUT AT $52 AND PUSHED TO

438
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:30,275
$58 AND ENDED UP SELLING FOR

439
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,643
$81.

440
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:36,148
JOE: IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PFIZER

441
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,015
COULD END UP WITH THE WINNER'S

442
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,051
CURSE?

443
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,954
WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING?

444
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,857
>> PFIZER IS SO MUCH BIGGER, IF

445
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:48,827
THEY DO AN OK JOB IN MERGING

446
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,930
THIS, THAT WILL BE FINE.

447
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,134
THERE ARE $212 BILLION MARKET

448
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:56,935
CAP COMPANY AND THIS IS A DEAL

449
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:02,140
THEY CAN DO EASILY.

450
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,809
THEY DID NOT DO THE HOUR AGAIN

451
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,078
DEAL WHICH WOULD HAVE SPENT A

452
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:06,878
LOT OF THEIR TIME AND ENERGY AND

453
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:07,946
MONEY, BUT THAT DEAL FELL APART

454
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,714
SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY TO

455
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,250
DO THIS DEAL.

456
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,084
AND 36 MONTHS THEY CAN LOOK AT

457
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,021
OTHER COMPANIES AS POSSIBLE

458
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,956
TAKEOVER CANDIDATES.

459
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,425
IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYONE IF

460
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,226
PFIZER CAME IN AND ALSO BOUGHT

461
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:28,299
THAT.

462
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,203
JOE: I KNOW THAT YOU AND ALEX

463
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:35,273
SHERMAN HAVE A POOL, WHICH

464
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:38,544
COMPANIES GOING TO GO NEXT.

465
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,277
ARE THEY ALL CANCER DRUG

466
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,078
COMPANIES RIGHT THERE LINED UP

467
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,414
AT THE TOP OF THAT POLL?

468
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:47,853
>> WE DO NOT HAVE THAT POOL, BUT

469
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:52,090
I MENTION THIS EARLIER, THE NAME

470
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,492
IS WELL KNOWN BY THE ARBITRAGE

471
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,293
COMMUNITY.

472
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:58,497
I THINK THE MARKET CAP IS AROUND

473
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,667
$15 BILLION SO THEY WOULD FETCH

474
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,402
MAYBE $30 BILLION.

475
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:16,248
MATT: PROBABLY OF $6 BILLION

476
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,282
MARKET CAP.

477
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,350
THAT'S ANOTHER ONE TO KEEP AN

478
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,686
EYE ON.

479
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,556
WE SHOULD ALSO KEEP THE NIGHT ON

480
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:29,461
AMGEN AND OTHERS.

481
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,662
THEY ARE ALL LOOKING TO DO DEALS

482
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,630
IN THIS SIZE AND SPACE.

483
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:37,436
SCARLET: WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH

484
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,804
CARE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A

485
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,571
RAMP-UP IN DEAL MAKING RIGHT

486
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:39,905
NOW.

487
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,741
IS THIS TYPICAL TO BE SO MUCH

488
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,508
DEALMAKING IN THE LATE SUMMER

489
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:47,246
MONTHS?

490
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,113
>> MADE THE MISTAKE OF TRYING TO

491
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,049
SCHEDULE VACATIONS IN AUGUST

492
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:51,817
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING

493
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,584
TO BE REALLY SLOW THIS MONTH.

494
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,920
BUT BETWEEN THIS DEAL AND THE

495
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,024
GAS DEALS, JUST IN GENERAL IT

496
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:03,094
FEELS LIKE IT'S PICKING UP.

497
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:03,762
SOME OF IT MIGHT BE THE

498
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,563
ELECTION, PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO

499
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,833
GET THINGS NINE WHEN THE HAVE A

500
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,667
SENSE OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

501
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,434
LOOKS LIKE NOW AND WHAT THE

502
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,638
STRUGGLES ARE GOING TO BE.

503
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,338
INVESTORS ARE GENERALLY

504
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,105
REWARDING COMPANIES THAT ARE

505
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,140
DOING DEALS.

506
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,176
I THINK THE INVESTORS EXPECTED

507
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,512
THEY WOULD GET THIS DEAL DONE.

508
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,313
SO THE ENVIRONMENT IS STILL

509
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,248
SUPPORTIVE OF THE ACQUISITIONS.

510
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,918
MATT: YOU LET US PERFECTLY INTO

511
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,120
ASIAN BUYERS WITH U.S. AND

512
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,659
EUROPEAN TARGETS.

513
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,493
JAPANESE BUYERS ARE LOOKING FOR

514
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,095
U.S. COMPANIES BECAUSE OF YEN

515
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:37,496
STRENGTH.

516
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,333
WE KNOW THAT NOMURA IS HIRING A

517
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,503
DOZEN OR 20 BANKERS BECAUSE THEY

518
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,804
THINK IPOS ARE GOING TO PICK UP.

519
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,706
>> THAT'S GOING ON IN PLACES

520
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,441
LIKE DEUTSCHE BANK AND CREDIT

521
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:54,479
SQUEEZE, -- CREDIT SUISSE.

522
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,280
IN GENERAL, IF YOU ARE IN CHINA

523
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,383
OR JAPAN, THE U.S. IS THE BEST

524
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,887
PLACE TO TRY AND ADD BUSINESS.

525
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,689
EVEN AT 1.2% GDP GROWTH IN A

526
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:07,826
ORDER, WHICH MAKES EVERYONE HERE

527
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,661
RING THEIR HANDS AND GET UPSET,

528
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,495
THAT STILL TREMENDOUS WHEN YOU

529
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,263
LOOK AT WHAT THE BASE OF OUR GDP

530
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,399
IS.

531
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,233
EVERY OTHER COMPANY WOULD LIKE

532
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:15,967
TO HAVE MORE BUSINESS IN THE

533
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:16,768
UNITED STATES.

534
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:21,172
MATT: LOOKING AT THE DEALS HERE

535
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:25,977
IN BLUE, WE HIT A RECORD LAST

536
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,213
YEAR AS FAR AS THE VALUE AND

537
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,147
NUMBER OF DEALS.

538
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:35,454
THIS IS A QUARTERLY BREAKDOWN.

539
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,254
ARE WE GOING TO GET TO ANOTHER

540
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,357
RECORD THIS YEAR?

541
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,560
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

542
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,394
ARE GOING TO SEE ASIAN OUTBOUND

543
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,697
DEALS INTO THE U.S. OR EUROPE.

544
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,631
I DON'T THINK WILL HAVE A RECORD

545
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,433
YEAR.

546
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,202
I DON'T ANTICIPATE A DEAL.

547
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,438
I COULD BE WRONG BUT I DON'T

548
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,607
EXPECT THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS TO

549
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,509

APPEARS, THAT IS THE ORANGE

567
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,587
LINE.

568
00:25:55,587 --> 00:26:00,258
THE HEYDAY OF MONETARY STIMULUS

569
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,025
WAS RIGHT AFTER THE FINANCIAL

570
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:04,095
CRISIS FROM 2010 AND PEAKING IN

571
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,898

AND COMING BACK DOWN AGAIN.

573
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,434
IT'S GOTTEN SOME PLAY LATELY

574
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,603
BECAUSE MOST OF THE ARTICLES ARE

575
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,472
ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF IT.

576
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:19,043
JOE: IT'S A FASCINATING CHART

577
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:19,677
FOR MULTIPLE REASONS.

WHEN INTO DORMANCY AND THEN IT

583
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:40,064
WAS -- IT'S ONE OF THE BEST

584
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,566
FUNCTIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW

1.54 PERCENT.

I JUST HAVE A SIMPLE YIELD GRAPH

590
00:26:57,081 --> 00:27:02,086
OF IT.

591
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:04,589
YOU CAN GRAB THE CURVE HERE AND

592
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,791
THEN LOOK AT IT OVER A WEEK AND

593
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,527
IT WILL SHOW YOU DOWN IN THE

594
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,863

.

597
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,269
WHAT WE CAN SEE FROM THIS IS

598
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,070
THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

599
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,572
SHORT END OF THE CURVE, THE

600
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,675

CURVE OVER THE LAST WEEK, YIELDS

604
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:34,519
HAVE COME DOWN AND THE 30 YEAR

605
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,020
HAS COME DOWN 4.5 BASIS POINTS.

606
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,656
BASICALLY THIS SHOWS YOU THERE

607
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:42,927
IS CURVE FLATTENING GOING ON.

608
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,331

00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,040

SCARLET: JAPAN WILL BE FINE IN

WE FILL 47% THAT YEAR THROUGH

699
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,229

743
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,395
TARGET.

744
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,030
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE JAPANESE

745

00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,302

ECONOMIC GROWTH IS BASICALLY

00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,019
BEEN ON PAR WITH UNITED STATES

752
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:22,720
FOR ABOUT 20 OR 30 YEARS.

753
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,487
THE ONLY THING THAT EXPLAINS THE

754
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:24,255
JAPANESE RELATIVE SHRINKAGE TO

755
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:24,989
THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN

756
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:25,489
THE LABOR FORCE.

757
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:29,827
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND, THIS IS

758
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:30,561
DONE NOTHING TO ADDRESS THAT

759
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:34,565
PROBLEM.

760
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,566
THAT'S WHY THINK IT'S NOT GOING

761
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,367
TO RESOLVE ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL.

762
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,669
SCARLET: AT ONE TIME JAPAN WAS

763
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:43,140
DOMINANT GLOBALLY IN ECONOMICS.

764
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,675
HOW IS IT THAT JAPAN CAME TO

765
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,509
DOMINATE GLOBAL ECONOMICS IN THE

766
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:45,943
1980'S?

767
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:52,249
WAS IT A SPECIAL CONFLUENCE OF

768
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:53,984
DEMOGRAPHICS AND TECHNOLOGICAL

769
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,785
SHOCK THAT CREATED THAT MOMENT,

770
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,687
OR WAS IT AN ANOMALY?

771
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,358
>> IN THE 1980'S, IT WAS A

772
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:00,991
COMBINATION OF THINGS.

773
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:06,464
JAPAN ALREADY HAD BEEN EXPORT

774
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:06,864
DRIVEN.

775
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:07,665
THE WORLD ECONOMY HAD JUST COME

776
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,334
OUT OF A VERY DEEP RECESSION.

777
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,168
JAPAN WAS ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON

778
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:13,571
THAT OPPORTUNITY.

779
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,039
IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN'S

780
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,174
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH, IT WAS VERY

781
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,142
HIGH.

782
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:21,011
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY DO HAVE

783
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:25,283
POSITIVE LABOR FORCE WROTE.

784
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,420
I WOULD SAY SINCE THE EARLY

785
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,858
1990'S, IT HAS CHANGED.

786
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,759
IT'S BEEN A PAR WITH THE U.S.,

787
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,629
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

788
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:39,630
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE JAPANESE

789
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,364
LABOR FORCE HAS STARTED TO

790
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,333
SHRINK.

791
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,970
IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN'S GDP, THE

792
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,875
U.S. HAS OUTGROWN JAPAN BY 25%

793
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,611
IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF GDP

794
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,111
SINCE 1990.

795
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:58,215
THAT OUTGROWN HAS BEEN EXPLAINED

796
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:02,420
BY THE RISING LABOR FORCE, NOT

797
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,958
PRODUCTIVITY.

798
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,493
THE JAPANESE STANDARD LIVING HAS

799
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,729
BEEN INCREASING ALONG WITH

800
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,932
PRODUCTIVITY GREW.

801
00:37:15,932 --> 00:37:19,036
FOR THE LAST 20 OR 30 YEARS, THE

802
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:19,837
STANDARD LIVING FOR THE AVERAGE

803
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,839
JAPANESE HAS BEEN INCREASING

804
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,606
ALONG WITH THAT OF THE UNITED

805
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,742
STATES.

806
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,211
IT'S JUST LESS AND LESS PEOPLE

807
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:27,878
ARE PRODUCING GOODS AND

808
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,247
SERVICES.

809
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,147
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A STAGNANT

810
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,782
ECONOMY.

811
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,751
IT'S NOT A SOLVABLE PROBLEM

812
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,621
UNLESS THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT

813
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,421
IS WILLING TO ALLOW A LOT OF

814
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,155
IMMIGRANTS TO COME INTO THE

815
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,825
COUNTRY.

816
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:42,660
OTHERWISE YOU CANNOT SOLVE THAT

817
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,327
PROBLEM, INTO THE STORY.

818
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,096
JOE: DOES THE PROBLEM NEED TO BE

819
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,298
SOLVED?

820
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,201
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

821
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,370
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM,

822
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,171
BECAUSE JAPAN IS NOT LIKE OTHER

823
00:37:54,171 --> 00:38:00,110
COUNTRIES.

824
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,911
JAPAN IS AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE

825
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:01,745
UNITED STATES, DON'T GET ME

826
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:03,080
WRONG.

827
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,149
THE JAPANESE LIVING STANDARD IS

828
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:05,983
INCREASING AT THE SAME SPEED AS

829
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,518
THE UNITED STATES.

830
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,419
THERE'S NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY

831
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:12,056
WRONG WITH THAT ECONOMY, BUT THE

832
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,926
ONLY PROBLEM HERE IS, JAPAN HAS

833
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:16,594
RUN A VERY RESTRICTIVE

834
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:20,531
IMMIGRATION POLICY.

835
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,332
THAT HAS REALLY UNDERCUT ITS

836
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,835
LABOR FORCE WROTE AND ALLOWED

837
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,972
ITS NATURAL DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS

838
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,175
TO PLAY ITSELF OUT, WHERE THE

839
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,110
U.S. WILL ALWAYS HAVE IMMIGRANTS

840
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,413
, AND NEW LABOR FORCE GROWTH.

841
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:37,047
THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE

842
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:37,481
DIFFERENCE.

843
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,251
SCARLET: YOU MENTIONED THAT

844
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,151
JAPAN WOULD BECOME THE

845
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:43,387
EQUIVALENT OF A NORDIC COUNTRY,

846
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:48,425
HIGH CUMULATIVE WELL, SOMEWHAT

847
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,394
INSULAR WITH A MORE LIMITED

848
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,662
IMPACT ON THE WORLD ECONOMY.

849
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:57,635
IS THAT OK WITH THE JAPANESE

850
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,135
GOVERNMENT?

851
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:58,936
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE U.K.

852
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,405
HISTORY, THE U.K. USED TO

853
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:05,476
DOMINATE THE WHOLE WORLD.

854
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,512
IT IS STILL A VERY AFFLUENT

855
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,213
ECONOMY BUT IT IS AN ISLAND

856
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,483
ECONOMY.

857
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,585
JAPAN USED TO DOMINATE THE WORLD

858
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:19,690
ECONOMY IN THE 1980'S.

859
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,558
THE SIZE OF THE JAPANESE ECONOMY

860
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,292
WAS WAY TOO BIG AT THE TIME.

861
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,360
AS THE BUBBLE COLLAPSED, THE

862
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,497
NATURAL PROCESS PUT JAPAN ON A

863
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,233
PATH OF RETURNING TO ITS NATURAL

864
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,067
EQUILIBRIUM.

865
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:30,901
I THINK EVENTUALLY JAPAN WILL

866
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:34,939
BECOME ANOTHER U.K. OR SLIGHTLY

867
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:35,706
BIGGER THAN THE U.K. BECAUSE

868
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,242
JAPAN HAS A BIGGER POPULATION.

869
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,076
BUT IT'S AN ISLAND ECONOMY

870
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,211
NONETHELESS.

871
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,145
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING

872
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,713
WRONG WITH THAT.

873
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:47,051
JOE: YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE

874
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,885
JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AND

875
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,021
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT EVERY

876
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:51,822
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WOULD LOVE

877
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,222
TO HAVE.

878
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:53,490
IT'S AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE

879
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,228
1995 AT 3.1%.

880
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,330
IF YOU SAY THERE'S NOTHING

881
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,097
UNDERLYING WRONG WITH THE

882
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,800
JAPANESE ECONOMY THEN WHAT IS HE

883
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,938
PLAYING AT?

884
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,306
>> I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THEY

885
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:09,974
REALLY THINK ABOUT THEIR

886
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:16,279
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS VERY DEEPLY.

887
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:20,050
YOU JUST SAY JAPAN HAS BEEN

888
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,986
STAGNATING FOR DECADES, BUT WAIT

889
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,253
A MINUTE, YOU HAVE TO REALLY

890
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:29,660
LOOK EAGER AND LOOK INTO THE

891
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,462
CAUSES OF WHY THE STAGNATION IS

892
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,165
TAKING PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

893
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:40,337
I THINK ABE IS ADDRESSING THIS

894
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:46,577
POPULAR -- POPULAR OBSERVATION

895
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,378
THAT JAPAN HAS BEEN STAGNATING

896
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,245
FOR YEARS WITHOUT REALLY LOOKING

897
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,413
AT WHAT HE IS DOING.

898
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:53,617
MATT: JAPAN IS LOWER THAN THE

899
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,351
U.S. IN THE MISERY INDEX.

900
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,353
YOU DO TALK ABOUT ACT THAT IT

901
00:40:56,353 --> 00:41:00,190
GROW THEIR GDP, BY ACCEPTING

902
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,793
IMMIGRATION.

903
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,627
ARE THERE IMMIGRANTS WAITING TO

904
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,464
GO INTO JAPAN?

905
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,600
>> AT THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

906
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,570
JAPAN'S CULTURE IS NOT VERY

907
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,539
TOLERANT, NOT VERY LIKELY TO

908
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,743
ACCEPT A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE

909
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,044
.

910
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:20,911
YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

911
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,347
PEOPLE IN JAPAN.

912
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:25,315
THE JAPANESE DON'T LIKE TO SEE A

913
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:30,320
LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE.

914
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,589
THAT IS THE CULTURE AND I'LL

915
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:33,123
RESPECT THAT.

916
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,226
FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW,

917
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:37,027
THAT IS A PROBLEM TO GROW THE

918
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,697
SIZE OF THAT ECONOMY, EVEN

919
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,765
THOUGH WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT

920
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,534
JAPAN HAS A VERY COMPETITIVE

921
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,803
EXPORT SECTOR WHEREAS THE

922
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:51,075
DOMESTIC SECTOR IS NOT THAT

923
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:51,675
COMPETITIVE AT ALL.

924
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,643
ECONOMICS CAN ADDRESS THAT.

925
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,510
WHY NOT OPEN UP THE ECONOMY A

926
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,046
LITTLE MORE?

927
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,514
JAPAN IS NOT A VERY OPEN

928
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:00,217
ECONOMY.

929
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,886
JAPAN CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT

930
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,922
THAT IN TERMS OF BOOSTING

931
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,092
PRODUCTIVITY AND THERE IS STILL

932
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:08,859
ROOM FOR JAPAN TO INCREASE

933
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,661
PRODUCTIVITY SOMEWHAT, BUT IN

934
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:14,098
TERMS OF OVERALL DYNAMICS, I

935
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:14,898
DON'T THINK THEY CAN CHANGE

936
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:20,304
THINGS VERY MUCH, UNLESS THEY'RE

937
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,071

LOOKS GREAT, BUT THEN REPORT

995
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:50,841
STARTED POPPING UP THAT THE

996
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,675

00:46:55,746 --> 00:47:00,818
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND RIGHT.

1001
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,986

PRESUMABLY GOING TO GOOD CAUSES.

YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FOUNDATION'S

1020
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,119
TAX RETURNS AND SEE WHERE IT

1021

1023

00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:52,996
FOR SUMNER REDSTONE," -- HOW

1124
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:53,730
QUICKLY HE HAS FALLEN FROM

1125
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,130
GRACE.

1126
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,667
MARIO HAS SEEN THE SHARES OF

1127
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,135
THIS COMPANY UNDERPERFORMS

1128
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,004
SIGNIFICANTLY.

1129
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,541
HE SAID THAT SHERRY REDSTONE WAS

1130
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:27,397
REALLY AND IN HER MOVES AND WE

1131
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,198
LOOK MORE TO THE FUTURE NOW, SO

1132
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:28,898
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH

1133
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:29,265
VIACOM?

1134
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:29,966
WILL IT STAY AS A STANDALONE

1135

1136
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,234
TOGETHER WITH CBS?

1137
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,068
I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT HE SAID

1138
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:32,836
ABOUT WHO MIGHT GET THE JOB DONE

1139
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:33,369

THE COMBINED OF $20 BILLION.

1145
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:51,721
YOU BASICALLY HAVE ONE OWNER

1146
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,489
THAT CONTROLS BOTH SO THERE IS

1147
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:56,793
NO TAKEOVER PREMIUM NECESSARY.

1148

1156
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,677

HILLARY CLINTON HELD A PRESS

1246
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,287

1247

1257
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,545

1258
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:07,482
FRONTS.

1259
01:03:07,482 --> 01:03:08,417

1260
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,019

1261
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:13,422
NOT HAVING A PRESS CONFERENCE

1262
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,190
MATTERS NOT AT ALL TO ANYBODY

1263
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:14,890
OTHER THAN THE MEDIA.

1264
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:17,393
I'M ALL FOR TRANSPARENCY.

1265
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:18,761
HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD HAVE MORE

1266
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:23,199
PRESS CONFERENCES AS A CAMPAIGN

1267
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,770
STRATEGY, BUT I DON'T THINK IT

1268
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,205
MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

1269
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,240
WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

1270
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,074
EDITORS WHO DO NOTHING BUT ARE

1271
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:34,877
LISTED ON MASTHEAD ANYWAY.

1272
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,780

1274
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:43,486
MOTHER IS THE EDITOR IN CHIEF.

1275
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,854
THIS MAGAZINE SAID THINGS THAT

1276
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,789
WERE IN OPPOSITION TO HILLARY

1277
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:47,590
CLINTON AND A LOT OF THE VALUES

1278
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:48,491
THAT DEMOCRATIC VOTERS SHARE, A

1279
01:03:48,491 --> 01:04:00,870
LOT OF AMERICAN VOTERS

1280
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:01,504
SHARE.

1281
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,371
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

1282
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:02,972
TEED UP FOR YEARS.

1283
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:03,806
THE FACT THAT THE CLINTON

1284
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:04,841
CAMPAIGN IS TAKING THOSE FOREIGN

1285
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,009
DONATIONS SEEMS HIGHLY

1286
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:07,676
QUESTIONABLE AS OF THIS

1287
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:15,017
STRATEGY.

1288
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,887
MARK: HILLARY CLINTON

1289
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,990
SHOULD HAVE PRESS CONFERENCES.

1290
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:25,294
THE SAME THAT DONALD TRUMP

1291
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:25,995
SHOULD RELEASE HIS TAXES.

1292
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:29,999
I BELIEVE -- I CALLED THE

1293
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:30,766
MANAGING EDITOR OF BLOOMBERG

1294
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,002
POLITICS AND I MANAGED NOTHING

1295
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,037
AND ADDED NO ONE AND THERE IS

1296
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:35,404
THAT.

1297
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:42,678
I DO NOT THINK MANY VOTERS CARE.

1298
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:43,546
THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS A HUGE

1299
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,816
PROBLEM BECAUSE IN OUR LAST POLL

1300
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:51,754
WE HAD 53% OF PEOPLE THINK THAT

1301
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:55,157
THE FACT IT ACCEPTS FOREIGN

1302
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,159
DONATIONS IS PROBLEMATIC.

1303
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,395
IT GETS INTO THE AREAS THAT I

1304
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,162
CARE ABOUT WHICH IS ACTUALLY

CAMPAIGN FUND-RAISING TANTAMOUNT

1326
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:51,781
AND IT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE HAUL

1327

FOR DONALD J. TRUMP,

1328
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:52,915
BILLIONAIRE.

1374
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,479
DIFFERENCE.

1375

1382
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,807

WORLD WOULD US AGREE.

1388
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:51,493
THEY HAVE GROUND OPERATIONS,

1389
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:52,294
TARGETING OPERATIONS, THEY ARE

1390
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,363
USING DATA IN A SOPHISTICATED,

1391
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:54,830
MODERN WAY.

1392
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,464
ALL THAT STUFF IS TRUE.

1393
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,265
IT CONTINUES TO BE SURPRISING TO

1394
01:08:57,265 --> 01:08:59,301
ME ALTHOUGH IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY

1395
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,903
TRUE THAT CLINTON HAS

1396
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:05,774
ESTABLISHED A NEW -- A LEAD

1397
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:06,575
NATIONALLY THAT TRUMP IS IN A

LOT OF PLACES WITHIN STRIKING

1399
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:17,319
DISTANCE AND HE IS RAISING MONEY

1400
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,053
TO PUT HIM IN A POSITION TO

1401
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:18,554
CLOSE THAT GAP.

1402
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:19,321
TO CLOSE THAT CAP WILL REQUIRE

1403
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:23,826
ACTUALLY DOING MORE.

1404
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,493
