remember when Netflix crapped their 5 star rating well it happened during the Amy Schumer controversy that saw thousands of people voting down her unoriginal and unfunny comedy special the flood of one-star reviews was blamed on right-wing trolls of course but the reality was simply that her Netflix special the leather special was an hour long bore fest that played on tired old jokes and talking points that appeal to nobody except far-left ideologues and feminists the debacle triggered Netflix to change their five-star rating system taking away one of the most valuable systems of deciding whether content is worth watching or not now Netflix uses a bizarre percentage system showing users the percentage likelihood that the content is something they might want to watch and now Netflix is going one step further and removing all online reviews by August 2018 CNET reports that Netflix is removing the desktop only feature that allows users to write and read reviews for their TV shows and movies they will be stopping the feature that allows people to write reviews by July 30th and stopping users from reading existing reviews by August 2018 now why is this well it seems to me that this could be another Amy Schumer situation Netflix is ramping up the development of its own content and we know it's not exactly conservative friendly the Obamas have signed a multimillion-dollar deal to give the former president a TV platform the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is really funny I personally really like it but you can't deny the far-left propaganda that's in it Bill Nye saves the world denied the existence of gender and a host of other comedians from Aziz Ansari to Michelle wolf overtly push a social justice agenda online so Netflix plan to total 700 original TV series in 2018 will no doubt include a plethora of far-left and social justice supporting shows and films a company pursuing such an arduous task last thing that they'd want to see our negative reviews so it's no coincidence therefore that by the end of the year all review systems on Netflix will have been completely removed this reminds me of Twitter with their head in the sand attitude no matter how negatively it might affect their business they brought plug their ears and pretend there's no criticism this tendency for ignoring criticism and charging forward with content or plans that trigger a negative response for a large selection of society is a classic indicator that those in charge are ideologues first and foremost at this point it seems to me that Netflix is run by ideologues who care only about forwarding a political agenda and not creating good content if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
