so what happens when someone you don't expect to do well does well and and best someone that that you wouldn't think that they would best for example Donald Trump who you don't expect to do well does well why does that happen well Trump is up against all these people that he shouldn't have any chance to beat there's a mentality of I'm just gonna do my best here I'm just gonna focus on this debate that's probably contributing to his unbelievable and unexpected success if you walk into a battle and you say to yourself I'm just here for this moment I'm gonna do my best in this moment and whatever happens happens that's likely to improve your ability to succeed if you're not caring about the outcome and you're okay to go back to your billions and your life without being present in the United States that's likely to help you if your opponent is so focused just on winning and not focused on this moment enjoying it as it appears that Donald Trump is well you might have an edge over them
