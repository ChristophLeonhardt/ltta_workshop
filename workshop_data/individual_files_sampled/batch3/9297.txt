MENTALITY CULTURE. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON KANYE'S DEVELOPING FRIENDSHIP IN THE PROGRAM. WE'LL HAVE ACTION TO ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS TONIGHT. WE'LL HAVE MORE FROM A GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE WHO I SAID I WANT TO WIN TO BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR. RON DeSANTOS. I KNOW THIS IS JUST RELEASED. WE'RE POURING THROUGH THE 49 PAGES. WE KNOW THE HATRED STRZOK AND PAGE HAVE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHAT DO YOU HAVE SO FAR? SEAN, I THINK THIS IS INCOMPLETE PRODUCTION. WE KNOW THEIR TEXTING HABITS, HOW OFTEN THEY WERE TEXTING IN OTHER PERIODS, THIS IS THE PERIOD DECEMBER 2016 DURING THE TRUMP TRANSITION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY AND THEN THE APPOINTMENT OF ROBERT MUELLER AS A SPECIAL COUNSEL. IF THERE'S ONLY 40 SOME PAGES THERE, THERE'S GAPS. SOME OF THE STUFF IS INCOMPLETE. SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS A FULL PRODUCTION. I THINK THERE'S MORE QUESTIONS THAT THIS RAISES AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND ASK THEM WHY THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO RECOVER THE FULL STRZOK-PAGE TEXTS. Sean: CONGRESSMAN, I HAD MULTIPLE SOURCES TELLING ME TONIGHT THAT THEY SUSPECT THAT THERE WERE OTHER DEVICES USED AS WELL. DID YOU GET THAT? IS THAT YOUR INTERPRETATION LOOKING AT THIS? YES. WE'VE ALSO HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE USING SOMETHING CALLED THE CLEAN G-MAIL. EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THE ACCOUNTS AND YOU DO MESSAGES IN THE DRAFT AND RESPOND TO DRAFTS SO YOU'RE NOT SENDING E-MAILS. SO YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY DO. USING I MESSAGE. SO WE HAVE TO GET ALL OF THAT THAT WE CAN GET FOR SURE. THIS IS NOT IT. SEAN, YOU'VE DOCUMENTED, THESE ARE LOVEBIRDS. THEY HAD ALL THIS HATRED FOR THE PRESIDENT. THEY WERE VERY QUICK TO PUT THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON. YET HERE, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL JUST SEE GAP AFTER GAP. I'M NOT SATISFIED. Sean: OKAY. I WANT TO GO TO DISH I WANT TO GO TO DIS I WANT TO GO TO THS I WANT TO GO TO THE I WANT TO GO TO THE I I WANT TO GO TO THE ISS I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE H I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE HOW I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE HOW I I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PETER STRZOK IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS? HE INTERVIEWED FLYNN? HE ALSO INTERVIEWED HILLARY CLINTON. THAT WAS IN JULY OF 2016. IT WAS EARLY MAY OF 2016 WHERE IT WAS STRZOK AND COMEY HIMSELF WRITING AN EXONERATION THAT ACTUALLY USED THE STANDARD, THE LEGAL STANDARD THAT MEANS HILLARY WOULDN'T HAVE BROKEN THE LAW. THEY CHANGED THE WORDING TO TAKE THAT PART OUT AND THE ORIGINAL DRAFTING ALSO HAD IN THAT MULTIPLE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAD HACKED INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL SERVER AND THAT MEANS TOP SECRET CLASSIFIED SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMMING INFORMATION WAS IN FACT OBTAINED BY AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NONE OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REDACTED, SIR. SO IF YOU WERE SOMEBODY ON HILL'S CAMPAIGN TEAM AT THE TIME AND COULD HAVE SUGGESTED CHANGES TO BE MADE, YOU WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED THE CHANGES THAT PETER STRZOK INSISTED ON TO TRY TO REDUCE HILLARY'S LEVEL OF RECKLESSNESS AND HER CULPABILITY. WHAT DOES HE DO AFTER COMEY EXONERATES HILLARY? A COUPLE WEEKS LATER, HE OPENS UP A COLLUSION CASE AGAINST THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BASED OFF OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS A TWO-PAGE DOCUMENT WITH NO ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE. THEN EVENTUALLY THEY SUPPLEMENTED IT WITH A FAKE DOSSIER PAID FOR BY THE DEMOCRATS. BUT STRZOK WAS THE PRIME DRIVER NOT ONLY BEHIND EXONERATING HILLARY BUT PURSUING THIS COLLUSION FAIRY TALE AND THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF MUELLER. Sean: UNBELIEVABLE. CONGRESSMAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET UP. THERE'S APPARENTLY 50,000 OF THEM. APPARENTLY 1.2 MILLION PAGES THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO GET. AND I'M JUST URGING CONGRESS, IF THEY DON'T HAND THEM OVER SOON,
