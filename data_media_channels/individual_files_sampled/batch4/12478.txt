sorry mr. Coons he's gonna be weeping into his sheets pretty soon it's so so sad for them isn't it the FBI has completed that supplemental investigation now did they need to do the investigation new judge Cavanaugh had already had six FBI investigations but after those hearings you know there were these new allegations that came out from Christine Ford and that crazy person from avenatti and all these other people and so the White House or the FBI did this separate investigation the White House confirmed late last night it was reported in the Wall Street Journal that they found no corroborating evidence whatsoever sent it over to the Senate chuck Grassley said there was no corroborating evidence whatsoever Mitch McConnell yesterday cocaine Mitch sat the vote for cloture crucially now we've got Jeff Flake that little Quisling Jeff Flake is saying there's no corroboration so it seems like he's going to vote for Kavanaugh Susan Collins same thing said the investigation seems very thorough so looks like we can hope that a she'll vote for Kavanaugh which means that it looks like mr. Kavanaugh is going to the Supreme Court of the United States for reaction we turn to the entire Senate Democratic caucus to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere that 40mm that's about what I expected but it's still very enjoyable to to see that again one second mm very very good
