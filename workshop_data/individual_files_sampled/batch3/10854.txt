well thank you very much everybody this has been long in the making you've heard many many speeches by me and talks by me and interviews where I talk about unfair trade practices we've lost over a fairly short period of time sixty thousand factories in our country closed shuttered gone six million jobs at least gone and now they're starting to come back you see what's happening with Chrysler with Foxconn with so many other companies wanting to come back into the United States but we have one particular problem and I view them as a friend I have tremendous respect for President Xi we have a great relationship they're helping us a lot in North Korea and that's China but we have a trade deficit depending on the way you calculate of five hundred and four billion dollars now some people would say it's really three hundred and seventy five billion dollars many different ways of looking at it but anyway you look at it it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world it's out of control we have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on which likewise is hundreds of billions of dollars and that's on a yearly basis I've spoken to the president I've spoken to representatives of China we've been dealing with it very seriously as you know we're renegotiating NAFTA we'll see how that turns out many countries are calling to negotiate better trade deals because they don't want to have to pay the steel and aluminum tariffs and we are negotiating with various countries mr. Lyte hyzer mr. Ross we are just starting a negotiation with the European Union because they've really shut out our country to a large extent they have barriers that they can trade with us but we can't trade with them they're very strong barriers they're very high tariffs we don't it's just not fair NAFTA has been a very bad deal for the United States but we'll make it better or we'll have to do something else the deal we have with South Korea is a very one-sided deal it's a deal that has to be changed so we have a lot of things happening but in particular with China we're going to be doing a section 301 trade action it could be about sixty billion dollars but that's really just a fraction of what we're talking about I've been speaking with the highest Chinese representatives including the president and I've asked them to reduce the trade deficit immediately by 100 billion dollars it's a lot so that would be anywhere from 25% depending on the way you figure to maybe something even more than that but we have to do that the word that I want to use is reciprocal when they charge 25 percent for a car to go in and we charge two percent for their car to come into the United States that's not good that's how China rebuilt itself the tremendous money that we've paid since the founding of the World Trade Organization which has actually been a disaster for us it's been very unfair to us the arbitrations are very unfair the judging's been very unfair and knowingly we always have a minority and it's not fair so we're talking to world trade we're talking to NAFTA we're talking to China we're talking to European Union and I will say every single one of them wants to negotiate and I believe that in many cases maybe all cases will end up negotiating a deal so we've spoken to China and we're in the midst of a very large negotiation we'll see where it takes us but in the meantime we're sending a section 301 action I'll be signing it right here right now I'd like to ask bobwhite Heiser to say a few words about the 301 and where we are in that negotiation and abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of the United States and we don't want that to happen we're not going to let that happen it's probably one of the reasons I was elected maybe one of the main reasons but we're not going to let that happen we have right now an 800 billion dollar trade deficit with the world so think of that so let's say we have 500 to 375 but let's say we have 500 with China but we have 800 total with the world that would mean that China is more than half so we're gonna get it taken care of and frankly it's gonna make us a much stronger much richer nation the word is reciprocal that's the word I want everyone to remember we want reciprocal mirror some people call it a mirror tariff or a mirror tax just use the word reciprocal if they charge us we charge them the same thing that's so it's gotta be that's not the way it is for many many years for many decades it has not been that way and I will say the people we're negotiating with smilingly they really agree with us I really believe they cannot believe they've gotten away with this for so long I'll talk to Prime Minister Abbey of Japan and others great guy friend of mine and there'll be a little smile on their face and the smile is I can't believe we've been able to take advantage of the United States for so long so those days are over ambassador light hyzer thank you first of all for those of you don't know section 301 is a statute that gives substantial power authority to the President to correct actions in certain circumstances well those unfair acts policies or practices by our trading partners in this case the area is technology technology is probably the most important part of our economy it's 44 million people who work in high-technology areas no country has as much technology intensive industry as the United States and technology is really the backbone of the future of the American economy given these problems the president asked us TR to conduct a study we conducted a thorough study we had hearings we reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents we talked to many many business people we had testimony as I say and we concluded that in fact China does have a policy of force technology transfer of requiring licensing at less than economic value at state capitalism where and they go in and buy technology in the United States and not economic ways and then finally of cyber theft the result of this has been that the president has analyzed it we have a 200 page study which we'll put out and he has concluded that we should put in place tariffs on appropriate products we can explain later how we concluded what products they are that that we would put investment restrictions on China with respect to high-technology and that will file a WTO case because one of the actions here does involve a WTO violation this is an extremely important action very significant and very important for the future of the country really across industries and I would really like to thank you very much mr. president giving me the opportunity to work on it intellectual property rights are our future and it's no accident that in June of this year the US Patent and Trademark Office will issue its 10 million patent 10 million patents there's no country in the history of the world that remotely approaches that so the steel and aluminum actions we've taken deal more or less with the present this action on intellectual property rights deals with the future so we're trying to solve both today's problem and problems that otherwise will be forthcoming that's why these actions are so important and so important in unison with each other we will end up negotiating these things rather than fighting over them in my view Thank You mr. president and to all our honored guests today's action sends a clear message that this president our entire administration are determined to put American jobs and American workers first the action the president will take today under Section 301 also makes it clear that the era of economic surrender is over the United States of America is taking targeted and focused action to protect not only American jobs but America's technology which will power and drive an innovation economy for decades to come it is just one more step of a promise made and a promise kept by President Trump so we'll sign right now I just want to let everybody know just for a second time that we are in the midst of very major and very positive negotiations positive for the United States and actually very positive for other countries also we have some of our great business leaders and leaders period right behind me I may ask Maryland Lockheed the leading woman's business executive in this country according to many and we buy billions and billions of dollars worth of that beautiful f-35 it's stealth you cannot see it is that correct better be correct right Maryland police say if you would well thank you mr. president I would just say that this is a very important moment for our country in that we are addressing what is a critical area for the aerospace and defense industry and that is our protecting our intellectual property as has been expressed that is a threat to us if if we have that stolen from our companies because that is the lifeblood of our companies and so we very much welcome this action on the part of the Trump administration and the President of the United States thank you this is the first of many this is number one but this is the first of many thank you all very much thank you
