STEVE: WELL, OUR CONGRESS IS
STILL WAITING FOR ANSWERS ON
THE FBI'S RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.
IN A NEW OP-ED CALLS ON THE
AGENCY'S DIRECTOR TO EXPLAIN
HOW THE INVESTIGATION
STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
COMPARING THE PROBE TO
WATERGATE.
OUR NEXT GUEST ASKS WHAT DID
THE FBI KNOW AND WHEN DID IT
KNOW IT?
BILL MCGURN WROTE THAT IN
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."
IS HE ALSO A FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> HI.
STEVE: THESE ARE TROUBLING
DAYS AT THE FBI, AREN'T
THEY.
>> THESE ARE VERY TROUBLING
DAYS.
EVERY DAY WE LEARN SOMETHING
NEW.
TWO SCANDALS.
HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL.
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
AND IT'S THE SAME CAST OF
CHARACTERS IN BOTH
INVESTIGATIONS.
STEVE: ONE OF THE THINGS YOU
SAY IN YOUR OP-ED IS WE HAVE
GOT DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER
WRAY.
HE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR.
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I
CAN TO HELP CONGRESS.
>> IN HIS STATEMENT HE HAS
BEEN VERY CLEAR.
STEVE: HE IS PLAYING A
DOUBLE GAME.
>> HE MADE END RUN EARLY ON
THIS YEAR WHEN HE WENT TO
THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE TO TRY
TO PREVENT, YOU KNOW,
COUGHING UP INFORMATION.
CHAIRMAN NUNES HAD
SUBPOENAED.
AND I THINK ALSO AT A
HEARING IN DECEMBER, HE KIND
OF SUGGESTED THAT HE
COULDN'T SHARE THIS
INFORMATION WITH CONGRESS
BECAUSE IT'S CLASSIFIED.
IT JUST GETS THE ARRANGEMENT
BACKWARDS.
YOU KNOW, THE FBI AND EVERY
FEDERAL AGENCY IS
ACCOUNTABLE ULTIMATELY TO WE
THE PEOPLE ACTING THROUGH
OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES.
STEVE: ONE OF THE OTHER
THINGS YOU ADDRESS, IS WE
DON'T KNOW WHY THINGS GOT
STARTED.
>> RIGHT.
STEVE: ULTIMATELY THAT'S
WHAT CONGRESS IS TRYING TO
GET.
THEY WANT TO SEAT SCOPE
MEMO.
THEY WANT TO SEE FISA STUFF.
FBI AND DOJ SAY SORRY THAT'S
OFF LIMITS THAT'S A BIG
DEAL.
CHRISTOPHER STEELE.
HALPER, THE DIFFERENT FBI
AGENTS, ANDY MCCABE.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT
STARTED.
THE FBI AND DOJ HAS BEEN
VERY RESISTANT IN PROVIDING
THE DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD LET
US KNOW HOW AND WHY THIS
STARTED.
STEVE: WHY IS THAT?
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO WONDER.
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS THAT
THE OFFICIAL START OF THE
INVESTIGATION, JULY 311st,
WAS NOT REALLY THE START.
THEY WERE LOOKING INTO SOME.
STEVE: THE PRESIDENT TWEETED
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT OUT
YESTERDAY.
CARTER PAGE WAS CONDUCTED
ABOUT STEVEN HALPER.
HE WAS CONTACTED ABOUT THIS
IN MAY IT WASN'T HALPER THAT
CONTACTED HIM.
IT WAS A GROUP THAT HE WAS
HELPING AND PUTTING ON THE
CONFERENCE.
STEVE: WE ARE PUTTING
TOGETHER A PUZZLE.
>> RIGHT.
>> THERE ARE A MR. PIECES ON
THIS TABLE.
WE LITTLE PIECE HERE, AND
HERE AND HERE.
STARTING TO ALL COME
TOGETHER.
ULTIMATELY IT KIND OF MAKES
THE FBI LOOK REALLY
POLITICAL.
AT LEAST SOMEBODY THERE.
>> IF YOU REMEMBER, DEVIN
NUNES HAS NOT SAID WHAT HE
SAW WHEN HE READ THE
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION
THAT LAUNCHED THE --
OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED THE
INVESTIGATION.
BUT HE DID SAY IT DIDN'T
HAVE INTELLIGENCE IN IT.
IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE BASED
ON AN INTELLIGENCE PRODUCT.
THAT'S A TROUBLING QUESTION.
ALSO, IT SHOULD BE A BIG
DEAL TO INVESTIGATE A
CAMPAIGN OR GET A FISA
WARRANT ON AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN.
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WAS
DONE MORE CASUALLY THAN
SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
STEVE: THERE ARE PEOPLE
ARRANGED THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES WHO SAY
THIS WAS SIMPLY, AT ITS
ORIGIN A BRAZEN PLOT TO DOOM
DONALD TRUMP.
>> RIGHT.
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S TROUBLING TO HEAR AN
FBI AGENT TALK ABOUT AN
INSURANCE POLICY.
RIGHT?
STEVE: YOU KNOW.
YOUR DAD WAS AN FBI AGENT
FOR YEARS.
>> I HAVE A LOFT AFFECTION
FOR THE FBI.
I KNOW GREAT MEN AND WOMEN
THAT WERE AGENTS AND ARE
AGENTS AND SO FORTH.
BUT, AT THE TOP, THIS
LEADERSHIP, I THINK, IS JUST
BEEN SCANDALOUS.
STEVE: CHRIS WRAY COULD FIX
THIS TODAY.
>> HE COULD.
HE GAVE IN HIS PRESS
RELEASE, SAID I'M DOUBLING
THE NUMBER OF STAFF.
THAT'S AN INPUT.
THE QUESTION IS THE OUTPUT.
