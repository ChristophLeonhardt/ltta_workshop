have the honest conversations with

yourself then have the ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:14,340
honest conversations with<font color="#E5E5E5"> others the big</font>

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,320
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between having a chat and</font>

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,109
having a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> chats don't get</font>

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,630
actions my builder taught me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,150
said the architects keep saying we'll

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,650
have a chat we'll have a chat will have

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,480
a check because I am sick of having

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,760
chats when are we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,729
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that became the mantra</font>

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,620
on the building site if it was a

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,590
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that meant everybody had to</font>

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus everything was different nothing</font>

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,629
in sports or business or life goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

16
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,300
different level unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have very</font>

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,309
very honest conversations with

18
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,770
themselves or with others most of the

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,020
honest conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened everywhere</font>

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,430
they shouldn't they happen at the water

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,949
cooler they<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in the men's room or</font>

22
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ladies they don't happen around the</font>

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,989
table why because people are

24
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,940
uncomfortable with having those

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,159
conversations so that honest

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,850
conversation can be at home it can be at

27
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">work or it can be in your thoughts in</font>

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,790
the real leadership is the ability to

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,689
distinguish is this a chat or is it a

30
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,909
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing improves unless</font>

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:00:00,000
people have on it conversation
