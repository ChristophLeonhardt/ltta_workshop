back in 2008 the economic collapse led to some watered-down regulatory legislation the dodd-frank bill that regulated some of the banking practices that led to that economic meltdown now 10 years later it turns out there is a bipartisan Senate effort to deregulate some of the bank's get rid of some of the regulations that would protect us the consumers from some of the predatory behavior that we experienced because of the banks now I mean it when I say bipartisan because there are Democrats involved here on one side are moderate Democrats such as senators Heidi Heitkamp and John tester from Republican leaning states who support the legislation because they say it will provide relief to small and regional banks and boost rural communities or economies but of course the Democrats are split on this legislation you have those who have co-sponsored it and support it and then those who are not in favor of the of it among them is Elizabeth Warren on the other are progressives like senators Elizabeth Warren sherrod Brown and their activist allies who argue that the bill will put consumers at risk the infighting isn't expected to take down the bill which probably has enough support to escape a filibuster thanks to the 12 Democrats co-sponsoring the legislation so real quick just to give you a sense of what this legislation would do the Senate bill would benefit the banks by raising a key threshold above which banks are subject to stricter regulation the new trigger that banks would face under the bill is 250 billion dollars in assets and that would be up from the current 50 billion dollars now the higher bar for bank oversight would scale back requirements from any of the country's largest financial institutions such as BB&T American Express and SunTrust so keep in mind by the way Elizabeth Warren pointed this out countrywide is something that you heard quite often during the economic collapse had assets to the tune of 200 billion dollars so it's a smaller amount than what this deregulation would apply to so this would take them off the watch list 30 to 40 new giant banks would now be less regulated and allows them to do more I've done stories on this in the past please check those out for great details on why this bill would be disastrous in this particular case what I'm more fascinated by is how much this represents everything I can't stand about Washington so what is political do political covers a story ok great fine and I know that it's subtle but I'm gonna read you a bunch of little parts of the story that gives you a sense of their leaning so they say that it was this bill was one of the few examples of bipartisanship it gives a positive spin to it they have agreed in a bipartisan manner with the corporate Democrats and the corporate Republicans to let the bank's rob us oh it's been 10 years since the banks caused the global financial meltdown people aren't paying attention anymore and we keep taking their money over and over again now that the political article talked about all the donor donations of these banks gave these corrupt politicians no no no mention of that it's an example of bipartisanship and here comes Elizabeth Warren and her activist allies and then later they're characterized this way they are working to undercut the party centrist they're not working to keep people taking corporate donations accountable that's not the language that's used they're undercutting the centrist the moderates they get all the positive connotations the activists allies are later described as outsiders but not in a positive way right like oh the good guy insiders do bipartisan deals where their donors get everything and you get screwed but somehow that's spun and then it wrong in a bad direction now for the Democrats of corporate Democrats they were described this way in the political article it's a chance to show voters they can work with Republicans and help their local economies not help the banks help your local economies the infighting isn't expected to take down this bill because if you fight against corporate Democrats by the way there's less Democrats on the bad guys side in this case thank God for that but they're not the ones doing the infighting even though they're less the majority of the Democrats in this case are doing the infighting because infighting is bad so they have to smear progresses with it and they say well this won't help as quote Democrats trying to convince voters they can effectively oversee their economy if you don't let the bank's get away with everything then you will they won't be able to effectively oversee the economy and it goes on and on and on and and so here it is again the mainstream media working with corporate Democrats to help support corruption led by the banks if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now TYT Network comm /join get the whole younger so every day
