WHO HAVE BEEN CORRECT AM OF HIM. THIS IS PUERTO RICO.

70
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:10,731
THIS IS PUERTO RICO. IT IS FOREIGN.

71
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:11,999
IT IS FOREIGN. IT IS DIFFERENT.

72
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,100
IT IS DIFFERENT. IT IS CONCERNS PEOPLE THAT,

QUITE HONESTLY, I’M NOT INTERESTED IN.

75
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:17,905
INTERESTED IN. JUST TO PUT IT ON THE STREET.

76
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,706
JUST TO PUT IT ON THE STREET. IT’S PUERTO RICO.

77
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:19,707
IT’S PUERTO RICO. IT’S AN ISLAND.

78
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,142
IT’S AN ISLAND. THERE’S A LOT OF WATER AROUND

79
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:21,575
THERE’S A LOT OF WATER AROUND IT.

80
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,777
IT. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

81
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:24,379
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? AND THIS IS THE CORE OF WHERE

82
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,813
AND THIS IS THE CORE OF WHERE HE’S COMING FROM.

83
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:28,115
HE’S COMING FROM. THE LACK OF EMPATHY AND CONCERN

84
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,218
THE LACK OF EMPATHY AND CONCERN FOR PEOPLE THAT HE CONSIDERS TO

85
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:32,820
FOR PEOPLE THAT HE CONSIDERS TO BE OVER THERE, OUT OF THE WAY.

86
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:35,089
BE OVER THERE, OUT OF THE WAY. AND AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS

87
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:35,423
AND AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS DAMMING.

88
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,225
DAMMING. AND AS PRESIDENT, IT SHOULD BE

89
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,827
AND AS PRESIDENT, IT SHOULD BE REALLY CONCERNING TO THE REST OF

90
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,094
REALLY CONCERNING TO THE REST OF US.

91
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,930
US. >> THERE IS NO ELECTORAL VOTE.

92
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:44,732
>> THERE IS NO ELECTORAL VOTE. >> ME MADE A POINT OF MAKING IT

93
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,801
>> ME MADE A POINT OF MAKING IT SEEM AS THOUGH PUERTO RICANS

94
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:47,535
SEEM AS THOUGH PUERTO RICANS WEREN’T AMERICANS.

95
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:48,536
WEREN’T AMERICANS. I THINK THAT’S THE RUB.

96
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,304
I THINK THAT’S THE RUB. SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE

97
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:55,243
SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE WITH WHICH HE TREATED HOUSTON

98
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:56,644
WITH WHICH HE TREATED HOUSTON VERSUS PUERTO RICO IN MARIA, AND

99
00:02:56,679 --> 00:00:00,000
VERSUS PUERTO RICO IN MARIA, AND I JUST, I THINK THAT WITH THIS
