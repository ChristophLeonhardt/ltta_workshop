Donald Trump was presented with a proposal bipartisan proposal to put through comprehensive immigration reform it did address a number of things that Trump wanted however he was not happy with this proposal because it included restoring protections for certain immigrants in the country these were immigrants who came in under temporary protected status and Trump did away with that temporary protected status these senators again a bipartisan effort asked to restore the protections for immigrants from Haiti El Salvador and other and African countries now here's how Donald Trump reacted to the proposal why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here and he was referring specifically to African countries and Haiti so I have more details on what the proposal included but Jake jumping alright so a couple of things here he's I mean just when you think he can't get worse he always does oh never underestimate how bad a person Donald Trump is now in an earlier meeting he had said about people coming in from Haiti they all have AIDS that was reported by the New York Times the administration did not disagree that that was the accurate tenor of the conversation in the White House but they said no he didn't actually use the word AIDS and then he talked about Africans and like why don't we have them go back to their huts you and I'll have the exact quote for you but I have it here as well but then again the administration said well there was a tenor of the conversation but he didn't use the word Hut's in this case there's Democrats in the room people are in the room everybody knows we can't just deny you can't have your lackeys deny it he said it in front of everybody why don't we why are we getting these country plays people from these shithole countries what kind of a thing is that to say if you're president of the United States what do you think that does to our diplomacy and besides what you're such a bad person and if you don't think that's a thing that someone saying is a bad thing I mean or someone's a bad person for saying that there's something wrong with you look are there some countries that are poor yes okay but to for the president refer to them that way it's so deeply offensive it's just preposterous we have an absolute moron even if he believed that come on guys you think it's a smart thing to say that in public in front of Democrats and everyone else I don't think he ever really thinks about whether or not what he does or says is smart because he's already convinced that he's like a smart person anyway but you know it's it's interesting because you ask why would he do that it's such a bad idea it's gonna get leaked of course it's gonna get leaked I I think it would get leaked even if there were no Democrats in the room as was the case with the statement that he made about people from Haiti having AIDS the reality is what he said goes directly toward his base and what his base likes and the meeting that originally happened in regard to comprehensive immigration reform the meeting from earlier this week made a lot of members of his base especially some of the more public figures like Ann Coulter enraged because he was willing to play ball with the Democrats he seemed like he was a little more reasonable when it came to immigration reform and they hated every minute of it and Coulter turned on him like crazy and so I was very curious to see how this was all gonna play out because as he you know moves away from the Bannon type people and more toward the Mitch McConnell type politicians there are members of his base that become less interested in him and so I don't know if he's doing this as an effort to play to his base or if he's just forgetting he just goes back and forth and flip-flops on everything no no I look I'm as positive as I can be there isn't the answer is there's never any strategy with Donald Trump it's just nothing but verbal diarrhea and so whatever comes to his racist mind he just blurts it out he has no filter he has no brakes he doesn't realize that what he's saying is bad so that's why he we had done a poll about who's dumber george w bush or trump now it's not even close because at least bush knew he wasn't that bright trump has no idea that what he's about to say is a terrible thing to say so look to give you more context on that in this meeting he then followed it up by saying why don't we get countries people from good countries like our way now wait a minute if you're talking about politics Norway is more liberal than any of those countries way more liberal Norway is so liberal they've got a mass killer in jail who's complaining that his human rights are being violated because he doesn't have the latest PlayStation ok and they're taking him seriously they are massively liberal in Norway it's not about politics stay white though it's about what he says Norway good African countries in Haiti bad or shitholes exactly so let me give you some more details among the Senators in the room were Senator Dick Durbin and here's what he had to say the president invited us to at his little get-together in the Cabinet Room to come up with proposals and we did it's a bipartisan proposal which we've worked on for four months in the Senate and I don't know what happens next so let's get to the details of what the proposal included it gave a lot of concessions to Trump that I completely disagree with yeah I hate it I hate it as well but not for the reasons that Trump hates it now the proposal presented by the bipartisan Gang of Six was a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and it went beyond just those who enrolled in daca when it ended okay so that's the good part that's the good part in favor of that now here are the parts or this includes some of the parts that I dislike in addition they proposed a down payment of 1.6 billion dollars requested by the administration this year on border security ok what happened to Mexico paying for the whoa why is my taxpayer money paying for a wall that he campaigned on and and said that Mexico was gonna pay for it I mean it's interesting they can't afford affordable housing programs they can't afford funding the entitlement programs but they can afford one point six billion dollars toward this nonsense wall all right let me give you more limits to the ability of recipients to sponsor family members and an end to the diversity lottery and reallocation of those visas in part to cover people who were under temporary protected status so hey you're allowed to stay but none of your family know we're gonna break the families apart anyway so look I think that there's a thousand things wrong with all of this they've moved over to Windows so far to the right now we're having a debate among which in my opinion incredibly right-wing proposal we're going to adopt but in the midst of all that Trump still says and this is how they move the window this is how they move the debate not good enough Democrats always say ok ok can we please have some scraps and Republicans always say no not good enough I want to be more loathsome more hateful and this proposed bipartisan legislation is not hateful enough I don't want people from shithole countries that's and Ana is his parts of his base gonna be happy about that oh yeah I mean look - all right it's gonna be ecstatic in coal truck can't stop smiling today I'm sure because she's as racist as Donald Trump is referring to the Browning of America and how that's a bad thing yeah and she moves to Los Angeles by the way which I don't understand if you don't like the Browning of America get the fuck out of Los Angeles yeah no she's a liar anyway it's all an act she's a performance artist and a lo some fascist racist one at that so anyway and and but a lot of the guys who uh yeah finally somebody calling it like it is yeah I hate those black countries right I got it yes some of those guys will be very happy but again there's got to be moms in Kansas going don't call them shithole countries that's terrible you know I hope so I hope so I mean we can only speculate but I do want to add one quick correction before we move on from this story we mentioned how Trump is not necessarily in favor of immigration from countries that don't have a white demographic that's not necessarily true because one thing that never gets covered in the media and it drives me absolutely crazy is that the Trump administration actually raised the cap for h-2b visas these are low-skilled foreign workers who come into the country and do the jobs and Americans might not want to do right he raised that cap from sixty six thousand to eighty one thousand in mid 2017 okay and then immediately after it was approved Trump's businesses applied for 76 foreign workers so if it benefits Trump and his bottom line then he's in favor of it doesn't matter what the race is doesn't matter what the political ideology is it's all about making money and using his position to benefit his own businesses which is why the whole conflict of interest issue was a big problem from the very beginning but everyone just dropped it not a big deal who cares so but look let me double down on the race issue though because you're right Anna when it comes to the workers that are getting that he could pay less he wants them for his properties but it's not like he thinks oh they're good people and I would like them in the country he thinks other low-paying jobs of course you give him the brown people so when he asked about Nigeria in the earlier meeting that not that New York Times reported on he said oh no I don't want him in the country because if they come here they'll never go quote they'll never go back to their huts in Africa I just can't I can't write this guy is the most deeply racist guy that we've had out in the open with the exception of actual grand Wizards of the KKK and neo-nazis etc and he's the president say things like huts in Africa should whole countries they everybody from Haiti has AIDS and why can't we get good people from Norway if you can't see that he's racist then there's an excellent chance you're racist you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea
