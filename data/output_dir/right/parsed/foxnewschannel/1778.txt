HIS EARLIEST ASSIGNMENT IS
TRYING TO SOLVE MIDDLE EAST
PEACE.
HERE TO JERUSALEM LIVE NOW.
>> THANK YOU, AMBASSADOR
FRIEDMAN.
YOU HAVE REALLY DONE A GREAT
JOB TODAY AND A GREAT JOB AS
AMBASSADOR.
TODAY HAS REALLY BEEN
SPECTACULAR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I AM SO PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY
IN JERUSALEM.
THE ETERNAL HEART OF THE JEWISH
PEOPLE.
AND I AM ESPECIALLY HONORED TO
BE HERE TODAY AS A
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 45th
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
DONALD J. TRUMP.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU AND SARAH
FOR BEING WITH US HERE TODAY TO
CELEBRATE THIS HISTORIC
OCCASION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ALL THE
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO ARE
HERE AND THEIR DELEGATIONS TO
RISE AND BE RECOGNIZED.
TODAY WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE
WITHOUT YOUR ADVOCACY
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.
THANK YOU, DEPUTY SECRETARY
SULLIVAN FOR LEADING OUR
DELEGATION, SECRETARY MNUCHIN
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND
FRIENDSHIP, AND OF COURSE
IVANKA, THANK YOU FOR ALL THE
GREAT WORK YOU DO TO HELP SO
MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING
ME.
SO I LOVE YOU.
I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE VICE
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE FOR HIS
TIRELESS EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN
THE U.S./ISRAEL RELATIONSHIP.
IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR,
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED TO
THE WORLD THAT THE UNITED
STATES WOULD FINALLY RECOGNIZE
THE TRUTH, THAT JERUSALEM IS
THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.
HE ALSO DECLARED THAT WE WOULD
SOON MOVE OUR EMBASSY FROM TEL
AVIV TO JERUSALEM AND JUST FIVE
MONTHS LATER WE'RE STANDING ON
THESE GROUNDS.
WHILE PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM
HAVE BACKED DOWN FROM THEIR
PLEDGE TO MOVE THE AMERICAN
EMBASSY ONCE IN OFFICE, THIS
PRESIDENT DELIVERED.
BECAUSE WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
MAKES A PROMISE, YOU KEEPS IT.
BUT TODAY ALSO DEMONSTRATES
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP BY MOVING
OUR EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, WE
HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN
THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN BE
TRUSTED.
WE STAND WITH OUR FRIENDS AND
OUR ALLIES AND ABOVE ALL ELSE,
WE'VE SHOWN THAT THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA WILL DO
WHAT'S RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE.
ISRAEL IS A SOVEREIGN NATION
WITH THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE ITS
OWN CAPITAL.
THE SAME RIGHT THAT IS ENJOYED
BY EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE
WORLD.
IN TAKING THIS ACTION, THE
UNITED STATES HAS ALSO CHOSEN
TO STRENGTHEN THE BOND BETWEEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
OUR SPECIAL BOND IS THE ENVY OF
NATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
THIS BOND IS FORGED THROUGH
SHARED HISTORY, SUSTAINED
THROUGH SHARED INTERESTS, AND
IMMORTALIZED THROUGH SHARED
PRINCIPLES.
THE UNITED STATES STANDS WITH
ISRAEL BECAUSE WE BOTH BELIEVE
IN FREEDOM.
WE STAND TOGETHER BECAUSE WE
BOTH BELIEVE IN HUMAN RIGHTS.
WE STAND TOGETHER BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE DEMOCRACY IS WORTH
DEFENDING.
AND THE UNITED STATES STANDS
WITH ISRAEL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
WE KNOW THAT IT IS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.
WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER FOR THE
PRINCIPLES AND VALUES WE SHARE,
WE SHINE A LIGHT OF JUSTICE
UNTO THE WORLD.
ISRAEL PROVES EVERY DAY THE
BOUNDLESS POWER OF FREEDOM.
THIS LAND IS THE ONLY LAND IN
THE MIDDLE EAST IN WHICH JEWS,
MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS AND
PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS
PARTICIPATE AND WORSHIP FREELY
ACCORDING TO THEIR BELIEFS.
ISRAEL PROTECTS WOMEN'S RIGHTS,
FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE
RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO
REACH THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL.
THESE ARE THE SAME VALUES THAT
THE UNITED STATES CHERISHES.
THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT BIND
US TOGETHER.
THESE ARE ALSO THE VALUES THAT
HAVE MADE ISRAEL ONE OF THE
MOST VIBRANT NATIONS IN THE
WORLD.
THIS TINY POPULATION HAS
SPURRED ADVANCEMENTS IN
TECHNOLOGY, MEDICINE AND
AGRICULTURE MAKING THE WORLD A
HEALTHIER, SAFER AND MORE
PROSPEROUS PLACE.
THESE ARE THE BLESSINGS WE HOPE
ISRAEL CAN ONE DAY SHARE WITH
ITS NEIGHBORS.
LAST WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP
ACKNOWLEDGED ANOTHER TRUTH AND
KEPT ANOTHER PROMISE.
HE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO
EXIT THE DANGEROUS, FLAWED AND
ONE-SIDED IRAN DEAL.
IRAN'S AGGRESSION THREAT ESPN
THE MANY PEACE-LOVING CITIZENS
THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND THE
ENTIRE WORLD.
FROM ISRAEL TO JORDAN, TO
EGYPT, TO SAUDI ARABIA AND
BEYOND, MANY LEADERS ARE
FIGHTING TO MODERNIZE THEIR
COUNTRIES AND CREATE BETTER
LIVES FOR THEIR PEOPLE.
IN CONFRONTING COMMON THREATS
AND IN PURSUIT OF COMMON
INTERESTS, PREVIOUSLY
UNIMAGINABLE OPPORTUNITIES AND
ALLIANCES ARE EMERGING.
I AM ALSO PROUD TO BE HERE
TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE TEAM
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
ENTRUSTED TO LEAD THE EFFORTS
TO BRING PEACE BETWEEN THE
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS.
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO WORK
WITH OUR NEW SECRETARY OF STATE
MIKE POMPEO.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN
BOLTON.
OUR AMBASSADOR, DAVID FRIEDMAN.
AND OUR SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE,
JASON GREEN BLAT WHO DOES SO
MUCH GREAT WORK.
I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY WHO
REALLY HAS CREATED A NEW DAY
FOR ISRAEL AT THE U.N.
ON DECEMBER 6th, PRESIDENT
TRUMP WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HIS
DECISION AND TODAY'S
CELEBRATION DO NOT REFLECT A
DEPARTURE FROM OUR STONG
COMMITMENT TO LASTING PEACE.
A PEACE THAT OVERCOMES THE
CONFLICTS OF THE PAST IN ORDER
TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN A BRIGHTER
AND MORE BOUNDLESS FUTURE.
AS WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE
PROTESTS OF THE LAST MONTH AND
EVEN TODAY, THOSE PROVOKING
VIOLENCE ARE PART OF THE
PROBLEM AND NOT PART OF THE
SOLUTION.
UNITED STATES IS PREPARED TO
SUPPORT A PEACE AGREEMENT IN
EVERY WAY THAT WE CAN.
WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR BOTH SIDES TO GAIN MORE
THAN THEY GIVE SO THAT ALL
PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN PEACE, SAFE
FROM DANGER, FREE FROM FEAR,
AND ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS.
THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES
THE SENSITIVITY SURROUNDING
JERUSALEM, A CITY THAT MEANS SO
MUCH TO SO MANY.
JERUSALEM IS A CITY UNIQUE IN
THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION.
NO OTHER PLACE ON EARTH CAN
CLAIM SIGNIFICANCE TO THREE
MAJOR RELIGIONS, EACH DAY JEWS
PRAY AT THE WESTERN WALL.
MUSLIMS BOW IN PRAYER AT THE
MOSQUE AND CHRISTIANS WORSHIP
AT THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY
SEPULCHRE AND WHY PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAS CALLED MANY TIMES,
INCLUDING RIGHT NOW, ON ALL
PARTIES TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS
QUO AT JERUSALEM'S HOLY SITES.
WHILE THE CHALLENGES TO PEACE
ARE NUMEROUS I HAVE PERSONALLY
SEEN THAT THE DETERMINATION OF
THE LEADERS IN THE REGION AND
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD REMAINS
STEADFAST.
THEY HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH PAIN,
SORROW, AND WASTED OPPORTUNITY
AND THEY THINK IT'S TIME TO TRY
SOMETHING BETTER.
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, JERUSALEM
HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF WAR AND
CONQUEST.
USED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE AND
INSTIGATE CONFLICT BY THOSE
WITH EVIL INTENTIONS BUT IT
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.
JERUSALEM MUST REMAIN A CITY
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE OF ALL
FAITHS TOGETHER.
TO VISIT, TO WORSHIP, TO
RESPECT EACH OTHER, AND TO
APPRECIATE THE MAJESTY OF
HISTORY AND THE GLORY OF GOD'S
CREATION.
ISRAEL HAS BEEN A RESPONSIBLE
CUSTODIAN OF JERUSALEM AND HAS
KEPT THESE RELIGIOUS SITES OPEN
TO ALL.
IN FACT, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
1967 WAR, ONE OF THE FIRST ACTS
WAS TO ADOPT THE PROTECTION OF
HOLY PLACES LAW ENSURING ACCESS
TO PLACES OF WORSHIP TO MEMBERS
OF ALL RELIGIONS.
FUNDS WERE IMMEDIATELY
ALLOCATED TO REPAIR ANY DAMAGE
TO THE CHURCHES, MOSQUES AND
SYNAGOGUES THAT SUFFERED
THROUGH WAR, CONFLICT AND
NEGLECT.
AS ISRAEL TURNS 70 THE SEARCH
FOR A LASTING PEACE TURNS OVER
A NEW LEAF.
ONE OF REALISM AND OF NOT BEING
AFRAID TO STAND STRONGLY WITH
OUR ALLIES FOR WHAT IS GOOD,
FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, AND FOR WHAT
IS TRUE.
WHEN --
THANK YOU.
WHEN THERE IS PEACE IN THIS
REGION, WE WILL LOOK BACK UPON
THIS DAY AND REMEMBER THAT THE
JOURNEY TO PEACE STARTED WITH A
STRONG AMERICA, RECOGNIZING THE
TRUTH.
THE PURSUIT OF PEACE IS THE
MOST NOBLE PURSUIT OF HUMANKIND.
I BELIEVE PEACE IS WITHIN REACH
IF WE DARE TO BELIEVE THAT THE
FUTURE CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM
THE PAST, THAT WE ARE NOT
CONDEMNED TO RELIVE HISTORY,
AND THAT THE WAY THINGS WERE IS
NOT HOW THEY MUST FOREVER BE.
IT WILL NOT BE AN EASY ROAD AND
IT WILL BE FILLED WITH
DIFFICULT MOMENTS AND TOUGH
DECISIONS, BUT IF WE DREAM BIG,
IF WE LEAD WITH COURAGE, WE CAN
CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR
MILLIONS FROM HOPELESS TO
BOUNDLESS.
THIS IS A HOPE THAT MANY OF US
KNOW PERSONALLY.
I AM HERE TODAY AS A PROUD
AMERICAN AND THE GRANDSON OF
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS.
DURING WORLD WAR II, MY LATE
GRANDPARENTS RAY AND JOSEPH
KUSHNER FLED THEIR HOMES TO
ESCAPE NAZI PERSECUTION.
SOMEHOW THEY MANAGED TO RESIST
THE HORRORS AND SURVIVE.
AFTER THE WAR, THEY BUILT A NEW
LIFE IN AMERICA, A BEACON OF
HOPE AND A LAND OF LIMITLESS
OPPORTUNITY.
IN MY OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE
I KEEP A PHOTO OF THEM ON MY
DESK TO REMIND ME HOW HIGH THE
STAKES ARE WHEN NATIONS FAIL TO
RECOGNIZE RIGHT FROM WRONG AND
THE DECISIVE POWER AMERICA HAS
TO TIP THE SCALES IN FAVOR OF
THE RIGHTEOUS.
TODAY WE TAKE ANOTHER HISTORIC
STEP IN THAT DIRECTION.
I AM CONFIDENT THAT AS A
RESULT, OUR NATIONS WILL BE
STRONGER, OUR PEOPLES MORE
PROSPEROUS, AND OUR FUTURES
FILLED WITH EVEN GREATER
PROMISE FOR PEACE.
MAY GOD BLESS YOU, MAY GOD
