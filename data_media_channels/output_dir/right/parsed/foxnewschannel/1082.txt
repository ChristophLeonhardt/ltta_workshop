KIDS FROM THEIR PARENTS WHEN
THEY ARE CAUGHT CROSSING THE
BORDER ILLEGALLY.
SHANNON.
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
OUR NEXT GUEST IS VERY FAMILIAR
WITH JUST HOW TOUGH IT IS TO GET
SOMETHING DOWN ON IMMIGRATION ON
CAPITOL HILL.
HIS CONSERVATIVE CRITICS SAY
DURING THE TIME HE WAS HERE HE
SUPPORTIVE MEASURES THEY EQUATE
TO AMNESTY.
AFTER STINTS IN CONGRESS AND AS
FLORIDA'S AGRICULTURAL
COMMISSIONER, ADAM PUTNAM IS NOW
RUNNING TO BE GOVERNOR OF
FLORIDA.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US, SIR.
>> GREETINGS FROM YOUR OLD
STOMPING GROUNDS IN TAMPA BAY.
>> Shannon: I LOVE IT.
SEVENTH GENERATION FLUORINE,
ALWAYS INTERESTED IN WHAT
HAPPENS DOWN THERE.
ALWAYS INTERESTING IN THE
BROADER SENSE OF DEBATES ABOUT
IMMIGRATION.
I KNOW YOU COME FROM AN
AGRICULTURAL AREA IN CENTRAL
FLORIDA.
ONE OF THE TILE THANKS TO SQUARE
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, MAKING SURE
THERE ARE WORKERS FOR THOSE
BUSINESSES AND MAKING SURE THEY
ARE HERE LEGALLY.
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FROM
ONE OF YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUES,
CONGRESSMAN DENNIS ROSS,
REPUBLICAN FROM FLORIDA.
>> I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IS
SOMETHING WE WILL DO LATER IN
THE FUTURE, BEEN HERE LONG
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE TEACHER
NEVER COMES.
I WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN.
I'M HOLDING OUT ON SIGNING A
DISCHARGE PETITION UNTIL I CAN
GET SOME PUBLIC GUARANTEE THAT
WE WILL TAKE THE GUEST WORKER
PROGRAM THAT HELPS NOT ONLY OUR
EGG COMMUNITIES, CONSTRUCTION
COMMUNITIES, AND SERVICE
COMMUNITIES.
WE NEEDED TO.
>> Shannon: HOW DO YOU BALANCE
ALL OF THOSE INTERESTS?
>> I THINK CONGRESSMAN ROSS IS
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THERE IS A TOTAL SOLUTION.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LED THE WAY
WITH HIS PILLARS PLAN.
SECURE OUR BORDERS, REFORM THE
CHAIN MIGRATION, PARTICULARLY ON
EXTENDED FAMILY, AND THE VISA
LOTTERY PROGRAM, AND BRING A
PERMANENT SOLUTION TO DACA.
YOU KNOW FROM YOUR TIME IN
FLORIDA THAT THE GUEST WORKER
PROGRAM IS A LEGAL MECHANISM TO
MEET THE NEEDS OF THE TOURISM
INDUSTRY, THE CONSTRUCTION
INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY,
AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF WAITING
ON WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON JUST FAILS TO DELIVER
A SOLUTION TO OUR BROKEN
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND THAT IS
WHY I WAS THRILLED TO BE JOINED
TODAY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
SHERIFFS AS I ROLLED OUT MY
SECURE FLORIDA PLAN, WHICH
INCLUDES THE SAFETY AND SECURITY
OF FLORIDA WITH REESTABLISHING
THAT TO SECURE COMMUNITIES PROGR
THAT TO SECURE COMMUNITIES PROGM
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REINSTATED.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE STATE OF
FLORIDA SHOULD HAVE THAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH I.C.E. BECAUSE
FLORIDA TAXPAYERS ARE SICK OF
PAYING TENS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO FEED AND
HOUSE AND     IN OUR PRISON SYSE
HOUSE AND     IN OUR PRISON SYS,
CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO
OUGHT TO BE IN THE CUSTODY OF
THE FEDS AND NOT TO BE DEPORTED.
>> Shannon: YOUR CRITICS HAVE
SAID, AND POLITIFACT CHECKED A
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU VOTED
FOR OR SUPPORTED WITH COMMENTS
ABOUT SOME KIND OF LEGAL PATH TO
EITHER CITIZENSHIP OR RESIDENCY,
LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCY, GREEN
CARDS, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS,
FOR PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY.
THEY CALL IT AMNESTY.
HAVE YOU EVOLVED ON THAT?
WOULD YOU SAY IT IS NOT AMNESTY
BY YOUR DEFINITION?
>> I'VE NEVER SUPPORTED AMNESTY.
I HAVE SUPPORTED FIXING THE
PROBLEM AND SECURING OUR
BORDERS.
I HOPE THAT WASHINGTON WILL
FINALLY, NOT THAT WE HAVE A
REPUBLICAN HOUSE, SENATE, AND
A PRESIDENT, BUILDING TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, I HOPE
THEY WILL BRING A FIX TO THIS
PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUING
OUR COUNTRY NOW FOR A LONG, LONG
TIME.
IN THE MEANTIME, THOUGH, I WANT
TO WAIT ON WASHINGTON, AND AS A
FOR GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA, WE PUT
OUT A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN, SECURE
FLORIDA FIRST.
THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN ENDORSED
BY SHERIFFS, AND THAT IS WHY I
HAVE BEEN ENDORSED BY
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN FLORIDA
RECOGNIZES THAT MY PLAN AND
RECORD IS ONE THAT WILL KEEP
FLORIDIANS SAFE, AND AVOID THE
TYPE OF SANCTUARY CITIES AND
SANCTUARY STATES THAT HAD THE
MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA DOING A
DANCE AND IT IS EXACTLY WHAT
CALIFORNIA IS DOING AND
UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS WHAT ARE
SOME CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR
HERE IN FLORIDA WOULD LIKE TO
SEE.
THAT WON'T HAPPEN ON MY WATCH AS
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.
>> Shannon: AS YOU WELL KNOW,
FLORIDA'S A VERY DIVERSE ESTATE
WITH DIFFERENT INTERESTS, AND
OBLIGATIONS, AND DIFFERENT
POPULATIONS, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE
A LOT OF FOLKS TO APPEAL TO AND
TALK TO DURING THE PRIMARY
SEASON.
WE'LL WATCH IT AND BE DOWN THERE
IN FLORIDA TO COVER SOME OF
