1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,710
- B is for Budget Cuts.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,500
In Leftese, the phrase
government budget cuts

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,730
means government budget increases.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,070
Budget cuts are not just
any budget increases,

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,350
but only those budget increases
instituted by Republicans

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,090
that are not as large as the
increases would have been

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,450
had Democrats been in power.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,587
Thus, when you hear a Democrat screaming,

9
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:25,090
"My God, they are cutting the budget!"

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,770
That actually means they are
making the budget larger,

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,580
but not as large as the
Democrats wanted it to be.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,450
You see, in the minds of
leftists, the government

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,170
and its budget must always be
increasing by a large amount.

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,210
The budget must increase
and increase and increase

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,140
until all your money must
be taken away in taxes

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,750
to pay for the government.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,080
Then when all your former money
has become government money,

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,490
the government can decide
how and where to spend it.

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,410
In this way, instead of having
you throw your money away

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,480
supporting local businesses
and church charities,

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,910
the government can make wiser decisions,

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,090
like filling 200 square
miles of arable land

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,210
with wind turbines that
produce enough electricity

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,740
to power the cigarette lighter

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,410
that is no longer in your car

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,250
because the government has
decided you shouldn't smoke.

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,140
After all, the government
knows what's best for you.

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,080
That's why it took all your money.

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,430
Therefore, if by some accidental warp

30
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,460
in the sure and certain progress
of historic inevitability,

31
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,270
a Republican administration
should come to power

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,040
and somehow work up the
courage to cut back slightly

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,770
on how much the government
and its budget are increasing,

34
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,490
this is a cut in what leftists thought

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,460
the budget was going to be.

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,180
Thus, a budget cut is
when the budget increases.

37
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,740
Now, I know, this can
sometimes seem confusing

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,240
to right wingers and
other sentient creatures

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,170
because normally when you cut something,

40
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,410
there's less of it than there was before,

41
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,810
but when you cut a government budget,

42
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,930
somehow there's more of it,

43
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,470
but in leftism, this
paradox is easily explained

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,750
with the simple phrase,
"Give us all your money."

45
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,750
Be is for Budget Cuts.

46
00:02:08,750 --> 00:00:00,000
