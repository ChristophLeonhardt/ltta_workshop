>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

76
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,214
WE'RE SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE 

77
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:59,586
ORDER I CONSIDER TO BE A VERY 

78
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,153
IMPORTANT EXECUTIVE ORDER. 

79
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:00,753
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING FAMILIES 

80
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,556
TOGETHER WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 

81
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,892
BEING SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY 

82
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,259
POWERFUL VERY STRONG BORDER AND 

83
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,562
BORDER SECURITY WILL BE EQUAL 

84
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,763
IF NOT GREATER THAN PREVIOUSLY, 

85
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,933
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STRONG, 

86
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,336
VERY STRONG BORDERS, BUT WE'RE 

87
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,438
GOING TO KEEP THE FAMILIES 

88
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:18,972
TOGETHER. 

89
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,708
I DIDN'T LIKE THE SIGHT OR THE 

90
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,876
FEELING OF FAMILIES BEING 

91
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,209
SEPARATED. 

92
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,210
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S GONE ON 

93
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,981
FOR MANY YEARS AS YOU KNOW 

94
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,582
THROUGH MANY ADMINISTRATIONS, 

95
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,883
AND WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD ON 

96
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:31,484
IMMIGRATION. 

97
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,885
IT'S BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD, 

98
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:33,952
PEOPLE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH IT, 

99
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:37,690
AND WE ARE DEALING WITH IT, SO 

100
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,492
STEP BY STEP JUST LIKE WE DEALT 

101
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,326
WITH NORTH KOREA. 

102
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,027
WE DEALT WITH IRAN. 

103
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,729
WE DEALT WITH AN ECONOMY THAT 

104
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,796
WAS HEADING IN THE WRONG 

105
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,964
DIRECTION. 

106
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,600
WE DEALT WITH A LOT OF 

107
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,033
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. 

108
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,238
THIS IS ONE THAT HAS GONE ON 

109
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,640
FOR MANY DECADES, SO WE'RE 

110
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,274
KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER, AND 

111
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,908
THIS WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. 

112
00:02:55,908 --> 00:03:01,147
AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE KEEPING 

113
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,081
A VERY POWERFUL BORDER, AND IT 

114
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,284
CONTINUES TO BE A ZERO 

115
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:05,584
TOLERANCE. 

116
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:08,587
WE HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR 

117
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:09,655
PEOPLE THAT ENTER OUR COUNTRY 

118
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:10,223
ILLEGALLY. 

119
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,691
WITH THAT I'D AND MIKE PENCE, 

120
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:13,426
THE VICE PRESIDENT IF HE'D LIKE 

121
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,293
TO SAY ANYTHING. 

122
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:15,995
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

123
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,330
I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S 

124
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,464
MADE CLEAR IS WE BELIEVE IT'S A 

125
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,899
FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN WHETHER WE 

126
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,734
ARE A COUNTRY OF LAW AND ORDER 

127
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,437
OR A COUNTRY WITH BORDERS, AND 

128
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,071
A COUNTRY THAT DEMONSTRATES THE 

129
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,740
COMPASSION AND THE HEART OF THE 

130
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,442
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND RESPECT FOR 

131
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:29,709
FAMILIES. 

132
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,577
BY TAKING THIS ACTION, THE 

133
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:33,746
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE 

134
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,882
FOR US TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN 

135
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,919
ENFORCING THE LAW AGAINST 

136
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,220
INDIVIDUALS WHO VIOLATE OUR 

137
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,022
LAW, COME INTO OUR COUNTRY 

138
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,657
ILLEGALLY BUT NOW WE'LL BE ABLE 

139
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,225
IN THAT PROSECUTION IN THE 

140
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,627
IMMEDIATE DAYS FORWARD TO KEEP 

141
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,060
FAMILIES TOGETHER. 

142
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,129
WE ARE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO 

143
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,263
CHANGE THE LAWS IN THIS REGARD 

144
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:54,934
AND IN A BROAD RANGE OF AREAS 

145
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,935
THAT WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS 

146
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,470
AND GIVE US STRENGTH AND 

147
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,272
CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE ONCE 

148
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,575
AGAIN GOING TO TAKE THE STEPS 

149
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,812
NECESSARY TO END THE CRISIS OF 

150
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,446
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN AMERICA. 

151
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,949
>> I THINK THE WORD COMPASSION 

152
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,050
COMES INTO IT, BUT IT'S STILL 

153
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,252
EQUALLY AS TOUGH IF NOT 

154
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:12,819
TOUGHER, SECRETARY NIELSEN. 

155
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,654
>> I JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,588
LEADERSHIP, SIR. 

157
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,322

HOUSE TO ACT THIS WEEK. 

159
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,459
WE ASK THEM TO DO THEIR JOB. 

160
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,562
THE LAWS NEED TO BE CHANGED. 

161
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,963
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT 

162
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,897
PRESIDENT AFTER PRESIDENT HAS 

163
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,465
DEALT WITH FOR DECADES. 

164
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,233
THIS ONE IS WILLING TO STAND UP 

165
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,634
AND FIX IT. 

166
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:33,773
WE ASK CONGRESS TO DO THEIR 

167
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:33,973
PART. 

168
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:34,507
THANK YOU, SIR, FOR YOUR 

169
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:34,807

>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GREAT 

171
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:40,480
JOB. 

172
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,747

HAPPY PEOPLE. 

175

176
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,497
60 YEARS, 60 YEARS. 

177
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,731
NOBODY'S TAKEN CARE OF IT. 

178
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:00,400
NOBODY'S HAD THE POLITICAL 

179
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,934
COURAGE TO TAKE CARE OF IT, BUT 

180
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:07,407
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT. 

181
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,008
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG 

182
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:09,208
TIME. 

183
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:09,575
>> CRITICS -- 

184
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,377
>> NO, NO, THE BORDER IS JUST 

185
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,745
AS TOUGH, BUT WE DO WANT TO 

186
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,312
KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER. 

187
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:17,784
THIS IS A PROBLEM IF YOU LOOK 

188
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,052
AT SOME OF THOSE HORRIBLE 

189
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,288
SCENES FROM A FEW YEARS AGO, TO 

190
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,589
ME THEY WERE HORRIBLE SCENES. 

191
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,892
THEY WERE JUST TERRIBLE, AND 

192
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,128
THAT WAS DURING THE OBAMA 

193
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:29,495
ADMINISTRATION. 

194
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,395
OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE HAD 

195
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:30,796
THE SAME THING. 

196
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,331
WE'RE KEEPING THE FAMILY 

197
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,866
TOGETHER AND SO THIS IS IT. 

198
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,234
ALSO THERE MAY BE SOME 

199
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:35,534
LITIGATION. 

200
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,537
WE'RE ALSO WANTING TO GO 

201
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:37,937
THROUGH CONGRESS. 

202
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:38,771
WE WILL BE GOING THROUGH 

203
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,138
CONGRESS. 

204
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,209
WE'RE WORKING ON A MUCH MORE 

205
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,978
COMPREHENSIVE BILL, A LOT OF 

206
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,979
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING 

207
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,613
TOWARD IMMIGRATION, AND PROPER 

208
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,714
IMMIGRATION, WE HAVE TO HAVE 

209
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:49,649
STRONG BORDERS AND ULTIMATELY 

210
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,918
WE WANT TO SEE IT DONE RIGHT, 

211
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,721
AND IT WILL BE DONE RIGHT. 

212
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,456
WHAT WE HAVE DONE TODAY IS WE 

213
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,324
ARE KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. 

214
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,727
THE BORDERS ARE JUST AS TOUGH, 

215
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,161
JUST AS STRONG. 

216
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,829
THEY CAN COME IN THROUGH PORTS 

217
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,833
OF ENTRY IF THEY WANT. 

218
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,037
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. 

219
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:16,242
THAT'S COMING THROUGH A 

220
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:16,976
PROCESS. 

221
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,446
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY 

222
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:20,646

WE'LL GET THE WALL DONE. 

226
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,220
WE'LL GET THE WALL DONE. 

227
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,988
YES? 

228
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:33,593
>> DID IVANKA TRUMP SHOW YOU  

229
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:33,960

>> IVANKA FEELS VERY STRONGLY 

231
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,427
ABOUT IT. 

232
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:36,228
MY WIFE FEELS VERY STRONGLY 

233
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:36,495
ABOUT IT. 

234
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,598
ANYBODY WITH A HEART WOULD FEEL 

235
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,098
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT. 

236
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,298
WE DON'T LIKE TO SEE FAMILIES 

237
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:40,967
SEPARATED. 

238
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,470
AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT 

239
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,907
PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY 

240
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,207
ILLEGALLY. 

241
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,275
THIS TAKES CARE OF THE PROBLEM. 

242
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,645
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 

243
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,513

247
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:58,851
PRESIDENT SIGNING THIS 

248
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,353
EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH HE SAID 

249
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,154
WILL END THE SEPARATION OF 

250
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,122
FAMILIES. 

251
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,657
HE SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE THE 

252
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,758
SIGHT OF FAMILIES BEING 

253
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,125
SEPARATED BUT THE ZERO 

254
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,728
TOLERANCE POLICY DOES NOT END. 

255
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,128
IT'S JUST AS THESE CRIMINAL 

256
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,064
PROSECUTIONS NOW TAKE PLACE, 

257
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:12,965
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE FAMILIES 

258
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:13,899
WILL STAY TOGETHER. 

259
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,702
WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN MAJOR 

260
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,637
GARRETT NOW WHO'S ALSO AT THE 

261
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:19,238
WHITE HOUSE. 

262
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,474
SO MAJOR, WHY THE EXECUTIVE 

263
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,709
ORDER, WHY NOT JUST A DIRECTIVE 

264
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,243
TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL? 

265
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,545
WHY NOT -- LEGISLATION LONG-

266
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:27,847
TERM, WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE 

267
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,214
THINKING HERE? 

268
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,750
>> THE WHITE HOUSE IS 

269
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,450
ESSENTIALLY ASSERTING THAT IT 

270
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,985
MUST FOLLOW THE LAW AND TO 

271
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,855
COUNTER MAN THE LAW IT NEEDS AN 

272
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:36,488
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROVIDE 

273
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:37,122
EXECUTIVE INSTRUCTION ALONGSIDE 

274
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:40,525
WHAT IT SAYS IS THE LAW THAT IT 

275
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,428
IS DUTY BOUND TO ENFORCE, AND 

276
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,664
THAT LAW THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS 

277
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,831
IS DUTY BOUND TO ENFORCE IS 

278
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,266
STOPPING EVERYONE AT THE BORDER 

279
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:47,933
AND PROSECUTING EACH AND EVERY 

280
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:51,169
ONE OF THEM FOR THE CRIME OF 

281
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,405
TRYING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY 

282
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:54,006
ILLEGALLY. 

283
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,374
NOW OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAD 

284
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,643
THAT LAW BEFORE THEM AND DID 

285
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,811
NOT UNIVERSALLY APPLY IT. 

286
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,846
THIS ADMINISTRATION STARTING IN 

287
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,649
APRIL OF THIS YEAR UNDER THE SO-

288
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,784
CALLED -- THE ADMINISTRATION 

289
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,352
NAMED IT THIS -- ZERO TOLERANCE 

290
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,586
POLICY, UNIVERSALLY APPLY THAT 

291
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:07,786
LAW. 

292
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:10,989
IF YOU'RE CAUGHT AT THE BORDER, 

293
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:11,923
YOU WILL BE PROSECUTED, AND 

294
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,259
UNDER A CONSENT DECREE, THAT 

295
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,230
WAS A RESULT OF YEARS AND YEARS 

296
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,066
OF LITIGATION, THE PREVIOUS -- 

297
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:20,566
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 

298
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,002
ESSENTIALLY AGREED TO SEPARATE 

299
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,303
FAMILIES IF THEY WERE BEING 

300
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,304
PROSECUTED FOR CROSSING THE 

301
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,105
BORDER ILLEGALLY BECAUSE 

302
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,474
CHILDREN, IT WAS AGREED, SHOULD 

303
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,077
NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY OF THE 

304
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,278
DANGERS OF BEING INCARCERATED 

305
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,145
WITH ADULTS, WHETHER THEY'RE 

306
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,182
PARENTS OR THE ADULTS THEY 

307
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:36,549
TRAVELED WITH. 

308
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,017
THE ADMINISTRATION KNEW THAT 

309
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,351
WOULD BE THE INEVITABLE RESULT 

310
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,520
OF THIS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY, 

311
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:41,986
SEPARATING CHILDREN. 

312
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:45,124
IT HAD TO KNOW THAT. 

313
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,661
THIS WAS A LONG STANDING 

314
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,361
APPLICATION OR PART OF 

315
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:49,828
IMMIGRATION POLICY. 

316
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:52,164
THE ADMINISTRATION WENT AHEAD 

317
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,400
ANYWAY, ENFORCED THE ZERO 

318
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,501
TOLERANCE POLICY, THEN SAW THE 

319
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,034
FAMILY SEPARATION ISSUE 

320
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:56,802
ESSENTIALLY BLOOM, BLOSSOM AND 

321
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,905
BECOME A HUGE POLITICAL PROBLEM 

322
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,507
NOT ONLY FOR IT BUT MORE 

323
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,109
IMPORTANTLY FOR CONGRESSIONAL 

324
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,676
REPUBLICANS, AND THE COMBINED 

325
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:05,711
PRESSURE OF REPUBLICAN MEMBERS 

326
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,981
OF THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, FIRST 

327
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,315
LADY MELANIA, DAUGHTER IVANKA 

328
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,585
AND OTHERS LED THE PRESIDENT TO 

329
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,952
ESSENTIALLY OVERRULE HIS OWN 

330
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,587
IMMIGRATION POLICY, AT LEAST IN 

331
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:15,788
PART. 

332
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,189
ZERO TOLERANCE CONTINUES BUT 

333
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,891
THESE FAMILIES WILL NOW BE KEPT 

334
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,158
TOGETHER. 

335
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,061
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW, JEFF IS 

336
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,095
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FAMILIES 

337
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,464
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN 

338
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:25,764
SEPARATED. 

339
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,900
WILL THEY SUDDENLY BE PUT BACK 

340
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,167
TOGETHER. 

341
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,002
WILL THIS BE UNIVERSAL GOING 

342
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,005
FORWARD, AND IT WILL IT BE ABLE 

343
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,640
TO SURVIVE LITIGATION, WHICH 

344
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,774
THOSE WHO HAVE WATCHED THIS 

345
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:36,742
ISSUE SAY IS ABSOLUTELY 

346
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,042
INEVITABLE. 

347
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,477
WILL CONGRESS USE THIS AS AN 

348
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,479
OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THIS WITH 

349
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,179
A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE 

350
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,681
PRESIDENT CAN AND WILL SIGN OR 

351
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,316
WILL THAT LITIGATION OR THE 

352
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:46,485
SENSE THE PRESIDENT SIGNED AN 

353
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,720
EXECUTIVE ORDER TAKE THE HEAT 

354
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,587
OFF CONGRESS. 

355
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,522
ALL OF THESE ARE UNKNOWN 

356
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:50,789
ELEMENTS. 

357
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:51,957
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IS 

358
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:53,859
ESSENTIALLY OPERATING WITH 

359
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,428
EXECUTIVE POWER TO RESOLVE A 

360
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,295
CRISIS IN LARGE PART OF HIS OWN 

361
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:57,562
CREATION. 

362
00:09:57,562 --> 00:10:00,700
>> WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE 

363
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,234
TALK ABOUT HOW IMMIGRATION HAS 

364
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,237
BEEN AN ISSUE THAT HAS NEEDED 

365
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:05,870
SOME ADJUSTMENTS OR FIXING FOR 

366
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,204
DECADES NOW. 

367
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:07,740
IS THERE -- WHETHER YOU AGREE 

368
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,742
WITH THAT OR NOT IN YOUR 

369
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,977
ESTIMATION IS THERE A FURTHER 

370
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,512
APPETITE ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT 

371
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,616
NOW FOR SOME SORT OF BROADER 

372
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:16,949
