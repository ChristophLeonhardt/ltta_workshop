1
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:13,621
>> Laura: WHY IT IS

2
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,355
PRESIDENT TRUMP SUDDENLY WORRIED

3
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:15,456
ABOUT SAVING JOBS IN CHINA?

4
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:16,557
TRUMP MAY EASE OFF THE U.S. BAN

5
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:19,060
ON EXPORTS TO CHINESE TELECOM

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,398
MAKER AND BIG GIANT ZTE TWEETING

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,034
TOO MANY JOBS IN CHINA LAWS.

8
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:27,468
HOWEVER THE HEADS OF THE FBI AND

9
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:31,472
CIA HAVE WARNED AMERICANS BY

10
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:32,540
BUYING ZTE PHONES BECAUSE THEY

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,841
ARE CONSIDERED A NATIONAL

12
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,275
SECURITY RISK.

13
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,943
IS SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SAYS IT'S

14
00:00:35,943 --> 00:00:36,678
CRAZY TO HELP ZTE.

15
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:37,378
I SPOKE WITH HIM JUST A SHORT

16
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:41,082
TIME AGO.

17
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,050
>> SENATOR, YOU HAVE BEEN

18
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,518
WRITING AND SPEAKING A LOT ABOUT

19
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:45,420
THE CHINA THREAT OVER THE LAST

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,021
SEVERAL MONTHS AND THIS REALLY

21
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:49,190
TOOK ME BY A COMPLETE SURPRISE

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,624
TODAY.

23
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:51,893
WITH THIS SEEMING REVERSAL OF

24
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,462
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY COMMON

25
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,030
SENSE APPROACH TO THE CHINESE

26
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,464
TELECOM GIANT.

27
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:59,367
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TONIGHT?

28
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:02,036
THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMED TO TRY TO

29
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:04,138
BACK OFF A LITTLE BIT IN

30
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:04,605
REACTION TODAY.

31
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,607
CHINA WILL HAVE TO MAKE

32
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:08,176
CONCESSIONS ON ITS PAST

33
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:10,211
CHEATING, FRANKLY, BUT WHAT IS

34
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:10,978
YOUR REACTION?

35
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:12,246
>> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T FEEL

36
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,614
BAD FOR THESE COMPANIES BECAUSE

37
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:15,316
FRANKLY THEY HAVE BENEFITED

38
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:17,351
GREATLY AND CONTINUE TO BENEFIT

39
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:20,221
GREAT GREATLY FROM THE THEFT AND

40
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:21,255
INTELLECTUAL CHEATING.

41
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:22,423
WHICH IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT

42
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:23,725
DOES ON BEHALF OF THEIR

43
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:24,092
COMPANIES.

44
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,226
IT WAS REALLY CONCERNING HIS

45
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:26,394
TELECOMMUNICATIONS IS ONE OF THE

46
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:28,029
TEN OR 12 INDUSTRIES THAT CHINA

47
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,697
TENDS TO DOMINATE THE WORLD AND

48
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,432
SO TO BE SELLING AMERICAN

49
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:32,467
TECHNOLOGY TO ZTE IS GOING TO

50
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,768
ALLOW THEM TO GET IT AND REVERSE

51
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:35,636
ENGINEER IT AND THEN THEY WILL

52
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:36,370
MAKE IT THEMSELVES THAN THEY

53
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,371
WON'T NEED US ANYMORE AND THEY

54
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:40,641
DO THAT IN EVERY INDUSTRY.

55
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,043
THIS WAS NOT A TRADE ISSUE.

56
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:44,145
IT WAS BECAUSE THEY GOT CAUGHT

57
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,280
HELPING NORTH KOREA AND HELPING

58
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,482
IRAN EVADE SANCTIONS AND THEY

59
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,282
WERE PUNISHED FOR IT.

60
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:49,050
BUT FRANKLY WE SHOULD NOT BE IN

61
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,020
THE BUSINESS -- ZTE SHOULD NOT

62
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,821
BE OPERATING UNFETTERED IN THE

63
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,789
UNITED STATES AND THEY SHOULDN'T

64
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,624
HAVE ACCESS TO AMERICAN

65
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:57,225
TECHNOLOGY.

66
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:58,559
>> Laura: SENATOR, THERE'S

67
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,294
ALWAYS THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE

68
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:01,028
NATIONAL SECURITY SIDE OF THINGS

69
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:08,770
AND THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS.

70
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,503
IT SEEMS THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO

71
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:10,037
TRIANGULATE ON THIS.

72
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:10,771
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT

73
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,506
FARMERS AND THE SOYBEAN TARIFF

74
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,240
THAT CHINA HAS THREATENED TO PUT

75
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,208
ON THEM.

76
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,843
ALSO WITH THE UPCOMING TALKS

77
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:16,511
WITH NORTH KOREA, WITHOUT A

78
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,781
DOUBT CHINA HAS PLAYED SOME ROLE

79
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:21,616
IN FACILITATING PERHAPS HOW

80
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:23,117
WE'VE GOTTEN TO THIS POINT THIS

81
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:24,018
FAR.

82
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,419
DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO

83
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,855
CONSIDERATION AS YOU JUDGE THIS?

84
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:28,689
>> NO, BECAUSE WITHOUT NATIONAL

85
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,124
SECURITY YOU HAVE NO ECONOMY AND

86
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:31,993
IN THE CASE OF CHINA, PART OF

87
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:33,427
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT IS

88
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:34,061
THEY INTEND TO WIPE OUT

89
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,464
UNITED STATES INDUSTRIES IN TEN

90
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:37,632
KEY SECTORS.

91
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,801
IT'S CALLED MADE IN CHINA 2025.

92
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,135
THEY HAVE TELEGRAPHED IT VERY

93
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:41,636
CLEARLY.

94
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:42,637
THEY INTEND TO DOMINATE THE

95
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:44,238
WORLD IN THESE TEN INDUSTRIES

96
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:46,040
AND ONE OF THE WAY THEY DO IT IS

97
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,074
THEY TAKE AMERICAN SECRETS, THE

98
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,442
EITHER SPY ON US AND STEAL THEM

99
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:49,644
OR THEY GET AMERICAN COMPANIES

100
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:50,778
TO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AND

101
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:51,813
THEN THEY TAKE WHATEVER IT IS WE

102
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:52,547
INVENTED AND THEY LEARN HOW TO

103
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,016
MAKE IT THEMSELVES EVEN THOUGH

104
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:56,217
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO UNDER

105
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:56,984
THE LAW AND THEN THEY GET RID OF

106
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:59,020
US AND THEN THEY START COMPETING

107
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,621
WITH US, SUBSIDIZED BY THEIR

108
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:01,022
GOVERNMENT.

109
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:03,624
YOU DO THAT IN ENOUGH INDUSTRIES

110
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:04,792
AND IT BECOMES A NATIONAL

111
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,228
SECURITY THREAT AND THEN IN THE

112
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:07,862
CASE OF ZTE AND

113
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:08,563
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, THESE ARE

114
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,865
DEVICES THAT COULD BE

115
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:11,666
THEORETICALLY USED, NOT

116
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,502
THEORETICALLY, THEY CAN BE USED

117
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:15,303
WITHOUT ANY COURT ORDERS OR

118
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:17,505
ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.

119
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:19,373
IF THIS WAS A FARM DISPUTE

120
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,875
THAT'S ONE THING, BUT THIS IS A

121
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,844
DIRECT THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL

122
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:23,644
SECURITY AND OUR ECONOMIC

123
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:25,680
WELL-BEING, WHICH ARE

124
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,049
INTERRELATED.

125
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:28,749
>> MARKEL, CHUCK SCHUMER TODAY

126
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:29,483
SAID AND I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR SO

127
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:32,753
LONG SO I JUST CALLED YOU MARCO.

128
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:38,526
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

129
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:39,126
>> JUST DON'T SAY PAULO.

130
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:39,760
>> Laura: SENATOR RUBIO,

131
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,661
CHUCK SCHUMER TWEETED OUT KIND

132
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,664
OF AN AGREEMENT WITH YOU AND

133
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:44,232
MYSELF.

134
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:45,533
HE WAS PRETTY HARSH, HE SAID

135
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,034
MAKE CHINA GREAT AGAIN.

136
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,436
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT

137
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,070
DONALD TRUMP WANTS -- IS

138
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,874
INTERESTED IN MAKING CHINA GREAT

139
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,242
AGAIN OR WOULD PURPOSELY HARM

140
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,611
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST

141
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,812
BY DOING SOME TYPE OF DEAL WITH

142
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:00,181
CHINA ON THIS DO YOU?

143
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:00,481
>> NO.

144
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:01,415
I DON'T.

145
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:02,116
I JUST THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

146
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,819
PEOPLE TRIPPING OVER THERE.

147
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,687
EVERY DAY SOME GROUP OF CEOs

148
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:07,288
COMES MARCHING INTO THE

149
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,322
WHITE HOUSE AND TRIES TO TALK

150
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:09,223
THE PRESIDENT DOWN FROM THE

151
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:10,191
STRONG STAND THAT HE HAS TAKEN

152
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,993
ON CHINA.

153
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:13,828
THERE'S A LOT OF VOICES.

154
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:14,629
PERHAPS EVEN SOME PEOPLE WITHIN

155
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,396
THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WANT TO

156
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:16,130
BACK DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON THE

157
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,833
CHINA THING.

158
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,034
THIS CONFRONTATION WITH CHINA IS

159
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,903
BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

160
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:23,070
FACING THIS COUNTRY ON A GLOBAL

161
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,838
SCALE.

162
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:25,072
THIS IS GOING TO DEFINE THE NEXT

163
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:26,173
80 YEARS.

164
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:28,809
THEY INTEND TO REPLACE US.

165
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,144
>> Laura: I COMPLETELY AGREE

166
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:30,845
WITH YOU.

167
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,647
THE BUSINESS INTEREST, I WOULD

168
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,415
SAY IF GOLDMAN SACHS IS HAPPY

169
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:36,083
ABOUT SOMETHING REGARDING CHINA

170
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:36,884
I'M USUALLY NOT HAPPY.

171
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,386
THIS IS ONE ON ANOTHER ISSUE ON

172
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:40,521
THE TAX BILL.

173
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,424
THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE QUOTED IN

174
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,425
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AS SAYING

175
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:45,226
ABOUT THE G.O.P. TAX BILL.

176
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:46,861
YOU SAID IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE

177
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:48,863
BENEFITS THAT ARE FLOWING TO

178
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:49,997
CORPORATIONS, IT WAS IMPORTANT

179
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,632
TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND DO

180
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:53,434
MORE FOR WORKING FAMILIES, AGAIN

181
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,136
IN REFERENCE TO THE TAX BILL,

182
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:56,003
OTHERWISE THE MESSAGE IS WHAT IT

183
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,439
HAS BEEN FOR 25 YEARS FOR BOTH

184
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,640
PARTIES, THAT IS WHEN PUSH COMES

185
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,942
TO SHOVE, WE WANT YOUR VOTE BUT

186
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:02,476
WE ARE NOT ALL THAT CONCERNED

187
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,477
ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS.

188
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:06,280
THIS IS WHAT TRISH REAGAN SAID.

189
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,648
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GUY WHO

190
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:09,083
LIKE TO LOWER TAXES.

191
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:09,784
LOWER TAXES ENABLE PEOPLE TO

192
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,653
KEEP MORE OF THEIR MONEY.

193
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,221
BUT NOW PERHAPS BECAUSE IT'S

194
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:18,225
BENEFICIAL TO HIM POLITICALLY

195
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:19,226
HE'S TRYING TO DIVIDE THE

196
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:19,827
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

197
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:21,228
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS

198
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:21,662
REFERRING TO.

199
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:23,431
I AM FOR LOWER TAXES.

200
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:24,865
I THINK THE WHOLE DEBATE BEGAN

201
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:25,833
WITH THIS.

202
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,936
WE HAVE A CORPORATE TAX RATE OF

203
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:29,203
35.

204
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,338
THE REPUBLICAN BILL LOWERED IT

205
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:30,638
TO 20.

206
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:32,740
I SAID WHY DON'T WE LOWER IT TO

207
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,708
21, WHICH IS STILL MASSIVE.

208
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,611
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT APPLE AND

209
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,646
GOOGLE, THESE MULTINATIONAL --

210
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,614
NOT TALK ABOUT S CORPORATIONS,

211
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:42,817
YOUR EVERYDAY SMALL BUSINESS,

212
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:44,218
MIDSIZE BUSINESS.

213
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,186
TALKING ABOUT BIG, MULTINATIONAL

214
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,153
BIG CORPORATIONS FOR THE MOST

215
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:46,854
PART.

216
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,122
I SAID INSTEAD OF LOWERING TO

217
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:51,425
20, LET'S LOWERED TO 21, STILL A

218
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:52,393
DRAMATIC CUT AND ACTUALLY SAID

219
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,530
20.9 AND LET'S USE THAT .9 TO

220
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,264
FULLY EXPAND THE CHILD TAX

221
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,800
CREDIT FOR WORKING FAMILIES.

222
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,471
IN MY ARGUMENT WAS THAT .9 WAS

223
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,705
BETTER IN THE HANDS OF THESE

224
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,407
WORKERS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

225
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,409
HURT BY ALL THE CHANGES IN THE

226
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:08,776
ECONOMY.

227
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:10,044
>> Laura: BUT IT'S OVER.

228
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:11,879
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM,

229
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,680
BUT THAT'S OVER AND NOW WE HAVE

230
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,682
THE MIDTERMS.

231
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:15,783
IT'S LIKE REPUBLICANS HAVE TO BE

232
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:16,550
UNIFIED ON THIS ISSUE AND I CAN

233
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,720
SEE THE ARGUMENT -- WITH ALL

234
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,654
THAT TO HANG TOGETHER HERE ON

235
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:21,288
THIS TAX BILL.

236
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:21,822
IT'S WHAT WE HAVE.

237
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:24,792
IT'S NOT PERFECT.

238
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,427
A LOT MORE I WANT TO, WE DIDN'T

239
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,228
GET IT.

240
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,430
>> IT IS WHAT IT IS AND ON THAT

241
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,264
IT'S A POSITIVE.

242
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,632
THE ISSUE IS THE ATTITUDE.

243
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:32,800
THE ATTITUDE THAT SOME PEOPLE

244
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,435
HAD TOWARD THAT CHILD TAX

245
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:34,869
CREDIT.

246
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,470
IT'S BETTER OFF IN THE HANDS OF

247
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,505
THESE BIG CORPORATIONS THAN IT

248
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,040
IS IN THE HANDS OF A WORKING

249
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,373
FAMILY.

250
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:40,307
THAT ATTITUDE IS GOING TO BE

251
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:42,743
ONGOING AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE

252
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:44,378
BECAUSE WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS

253
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:45,513
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CRUSHED OVER

254
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:47,681
THE LAST 20 YEARS BY ALL THESE

255
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:48,649
CHANGES.

256
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,051
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

257
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:50,918
>> Laura: THAT'S FOR SURE.

258
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,888
WE WILL SEE NEXT YEAR THE FULL

259
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:54,822
FORCE OF THE TAX BILL KICK IN

260
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,257
WHEN THEY HAVE TO FILE THEIR

261
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:58,993
TAXES UNDER THIS NEW REGIME IN

262
00:06:58,993 --> 00:06:59,460
2019.

263
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,262
SENATOR RUBIO, BEFORE WE LET YOU

264
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:01,996
GO, BIG BLOCKBUSTER STORY TODAY

265
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:02,396
IN THE HILL.

266
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,865
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE STORY

267
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:07,468
MUELLER HAD NOT DISCLOSED THIS

268
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,271
BEFORE HE WAS NAMED OF COURSE

269
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:10,738
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

270
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:15,876
>> FIRST OF ALL, BOB LEVINSON IS

271
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:16,710
A FLORIDIAN, THE FAMILY IS FROM

272
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,211
FLORIDA.

273
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,879
I WANTED TO DO EVERYTHING

274
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,014
POSSIBLE WITH A LOT TO GET HIM

275
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:21,882
HOME AND WE MET WITH THE TRUMP

276
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:23,851
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HIS CASE.

277
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,886
UNFAIRLY DETAINED, HIS CASE WAS

278
00:07:25,886 --> 00:07:26,554
FORGOTTEN AT THE END OF THE

279
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:28,422
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN

280
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,657
THEY'RE CUTTING DEALS WITH IRAN.

281
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,792
THIS IS A MAN WHO SERVED POTOMAC

282
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,060
SERVED OUR COUNTRY AND WAS

283
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,627
UNJUSTLY KIDNAPPED.

284
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,029
>> Laura: THIS IS WHAT I'M

285
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:40,835
SAYING, A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH USED

286
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,469
$25 MILLION ACCORDING TO

287
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:42,136
MULTIPLE SOURCES OF HIS OWN

288
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:46,073
MONEY TO GET THIS GUY OUT.

289
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:47,041
>> SO I'M ON THE INTELLIGENCE

290
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,576
COMMITTEE SO I WANT TO BE

291
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:49,677
CAREFUL ABOUT CONFIRMING OR

292
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,278
DENYING ANY SORT OF MEDIA

293
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:51,979
ARTICLES BECAUSE A LOT OF THE

294
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:52,947
WORK THAT'S BEING DONE WITH

295
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:53,881
REGARD TO THIS, I'M NOT

296
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:54,882
CONFIRMING IT.

297
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:55,950
I SAW THE SAME ARTICLE.

298
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,854
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT

299
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,055
MR. MUELLER IS IN BOSTON,

300
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:01,889
CONDUCTING THIS INVESTIGATION.

301
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,058
IF THERE IS A CONFLICT OF

302
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:06,427
INTEREST AT SOME POINT IT WOULD

303
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:07,128
JEOPARDIZE THE INVESTIGATION.

304
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:07,828
WE DON'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS.

305
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,697
I THINK WE WILL SEE AS THIS

306
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,765
THING ROLLS FORWARD AND AS HE

307
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:12,867
BRINGS OUT -- THIS INVESTIGATION

308
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,235
HAS TO END AT SOME POINT.

309
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,269
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

310
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,737
WHO HE WENT AFTER AND WHO HE

311
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,038
DIDN'T AND THEN ASK THESE

312
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:18,439
QUESTIONS.

313
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,840
BUT WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THAT

314
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,841
MOMENT ARRIVES.

315
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:21,575
BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE

316
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:23,077
HAVE THAT ARTICLE.

317
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:24,478
I DON'T EVEN KNOW QUITE FRANKLY

318
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,413
HOW ANY OF THAT IS CLASSIFIED OR

319
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:26,914
NOT AT THIS POINT.

320
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:29,283
SO I PERSONALLY CAUTIOUS.

321
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:29,950
I'M TRYING TO BE EVASIVE.

322
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,585
I DON'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE

323
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:32,785
HERE AND GO BEYOND WHERE I

324
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:33,120
SHOULD.

325
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,589
TWO FIGHTS TO SAY FOR PURPOSES

326
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:36,423
OF AN INVESTIGATION BOB MUELLER

327
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:37,091
SHOULD BE ABLE TO FINISH HIS

328
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:39,326
WORK AND THEN -- IT HAS TO END

329
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:40,059
AT SOME POINT AND HE WILL BE

330
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,995
ABLE TO LOOK AT IT ALL AND SAY

331
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:43,130
WHY DID YOU DO THIS OR NOT DO

332
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,664
THAT?

333
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:44,665
>> Laura: I THINK WE ARE GOING

334
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:45,966
TO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS

335
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:46,767
IN THE DAYS TO COME BUT WE

336
00:08:46,767 --> 00:00:00,000
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR VOICE ON
