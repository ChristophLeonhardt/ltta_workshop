so what's the latest news from the nanny state front regarding the ongoing war on fun would you believe banning bouncy castles oh it's true well thank God for the safety first edge ekran running edmonton public schools because these learned folks have now been bouncy castles as well as most other inflatables and trampolines at the city's 213 schools at long last we can all go to sleep at night with a clear conscience that the little ones won't be traumatized by some inflatable play device that's really a death trap indeed according to an emerson journal story the latest ban on fun applies to any inflatable attraction supported by a blower which schools sometimes rent as part of year-end celebrations guess the kids will just have to play hopscotch instead zooming hopscotch hasn't been banned as well Schools spokeswoman Kari Rosa says the inflatable ban is justified thanks to a couple of students at Victoria School of the Arts that were hurt last year while playing on an inflatable and Edmonton Schools takes the safety of its students very seriously yeah so seriously that should a kid get a bruise or a cutter is great well it's bye-bye bouncy castle think of the children after all the speaking of children one must ponder have these adults banning everything that was fun completely forgotten what it was like to be a kid apparently and this being 2018 there would appear to be a me-too vibe happening here as well after all regulations state that school staff and students are prohibited from having any physical contact because as we know all physical contact is bad I'm just going to assume that Edmonton Public Schools have already removed wrestling from the phys ed program as per usual there was no consultation with parents were guarding the ban which also includes obstacle courses and even slides yeah slides better safe than sorry after all as for the nitty-gritty numbers it turns out that about 80 people were treated for injuries in the past two years in Alberta due to playing on an inflatable device Oh which means I suspect that hundreds of thousands of people bounced away on inflatable devices without any injury occurring whatsoever during those two years you know it all reminds me of the Saturday Night Live parody from 1977 when a sleazy toymaker played by Dan Aykroyd points to the potential dangers of supposedly child-friendly toys and yes sir decade this played for laughs today the clear and present potential danger of a Nerf ball is a reality but what than any state advocates fail to understand is that injuries are part of childhood stuff happens not every trip to the playground comes with a guarantee that a child will not suffer a cut or a bruise but it used to be that such potential injuries were worth it given the inherent joy of physical play or does Edmonton Public Schools simply want kids to sit on a couch entombed in bubble wrap as they play video games if that's the case it kind of makes you wonder whatever happened to that war on obesity we're all supposed to be fighting these days a for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
