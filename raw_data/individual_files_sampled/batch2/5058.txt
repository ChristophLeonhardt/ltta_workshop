Tom I do want to start with you get us up to speed what exactly happened in court today did the judge rule on whether or not there would be a special master so Katie just moments ago cord wrapped up here in New York there is a there is a temporary restraining order there was requested that has been denied but I want to get right away to Hanna rapidly with the NBC News investigative unit Hanna's stayed in court through the through the conclusion of proceedings today it has a little more information about what prosecutors and attorneys are going to have to work out right so the judge did not rule out the possibility of a so-called taint team or a Special Master determine what document seized our privilege in what arm but right now what she said is the government has to start producing those documents that they seized they're going to share those on a rolling basis with opposing counsel and then we're all going to meet again to determine the best course of action and also counsel as well as US attorneys are going to be submitting names of possible special masters to be used in the future so bottom line Katie we're not cool we haven't quite figured out the question of what's going to happen yet next rather and in what prosecutors are going to be able to have a chance to look at so this certainly slows things down it is an active investigation as we know from court filings last week Michael Cohen is under federal criminal investigation as you highlighted there were covert surveillance that has been done on mr. Cohen my understanding of that is that includes a wiretap in this case so this is a very significant investigation that is now being slowed down a little bit but obviously obviously some things still to be worked out by attorneys and in probably another hearing to come well let me clarify something with you Tom the government has to share all of what they found with Michael Cohen yes so according to what happened here at the the hearing the government will have to share with him exactly what they found now that may sound like a big deal there were ten physical boxes of evidence according to what we heard in the hearing today KT that were taken from Michael Cohen but a lot of the electronic evidence the computers the hard drives etc those were imaged on the spot meaning the government copied the the hard drives in that media when they were doing the search and they left them with Michael Cohen so in reality he probably has a really good idea particularly on the electronic front exactly what it is that the government has that probably shouldn't be too much of a surprise to him now obviously you know if you have one filing cabinet at home he might have a hard time remembering what you have inside of it so as far as the physical evidence they're gonna have to make copies of that and get it back to him hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
