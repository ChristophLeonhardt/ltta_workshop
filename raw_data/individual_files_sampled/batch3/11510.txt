hello I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report you know what's amazing somebody came up to me at the crypto conference here in Puerto Rico this guy created Pepe memes Tippett cash he handed me a keychain is it thanks so much max for supporting the meme economy and it's a very rare Pepe Pepe Pepe meme token and there's gonna be more about this coming up in New York and a few short weeks I'm very excited by this stay tuned for that but meanwhile let's stick to Puerto Rico for a second Stacey what's happening what's your meme weaponize that's the thing all memes are weaponized in the Battle of the mind as Brock Pierce told me we are constantly fighting the demons in our mind we are the heroes of our time I think that's the famous song the famous song that Brock likes to play they're very loud at breakfast I want to talk about debt as you know Puerto Rico had the seventy billion dollars of debt when they first went bankrupt and defaulted on their general obligation bond payment of two billion dollars on July 1st 2016 then the hurricane Maria hit and Irma right before that and they have about ninety five billion dollars worth of damage on the island so a lot of debt a lot of debt and people in America you know as Congress debates whether or not to help the people of Puerto Rico out as they would any other US citizen like those in Texas hit by Hurricane Harvey are those in New Orleans hit by Hurricane Katrina you know there's usually more funds forthcoming to help Americans redevelop and get better so I want to look at the US debt situation right oh those people who point their fingers u.s. gross national debt spikes one point two trillion dollars in six months hits 21 trillion dollars max 21 trillion dollars what yeah well you know the GDP of America is not anywhere near 21 trillion dollars so you've got a country now where the debt is well above GDP it's as a function of assets on the book of this Bank four or five times bigger than the central bank it's way out of control the only way they can manage this is to keep interest rates artificially low and of course that creates the wealth and income gaps that result in San Francisco where you've got billionaires in the towers homeless people shooting up smack on the streets that's a direct result of the Federal Reserve Bank's policies to keep insolvent banks zombie banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs from having to declare bankruptcy and a result of social unrest results in all kinds of matter of destitution Thanks central bank's you putz if the crypto billionaires if the crypto economy if all those young guys like Jonathan Gonzalez from the last episode if they make this the sort of Switzerland of the crypto global economy it could be that Puerto Rico one day is has to bail out the federal government it might be the other way around well you know when I talk to people in the crypto community like Jameson lop for example there's been on our show a few times or Brock Pierce who's really a visionary and a genius you know they say that eventually the federal government will come to the crypto community for a bailout because the crypto community will have the only hard assets that you can move around with any kind of speed and regularity so this brief respite on the crypto market cap down from 800 and something billion to 300 billion is one that will be taken to a new high of multi trillion dollars and the sell-off of 2018 will not be visible on the long-term chart just like the previous 60 to 70% sell offs are not visible on the long-term chart it does give a bit of a showcase for charlatans like Nouriel Roubini or Paul Krugman who are establishment lackeys we would like to espouse propaganda on behalf of their overlords on Wall Street sure but those people need to be ignored John Oliver over there at the John Oliver show you know HBO he is you know throwing shade on crypto in a way that would not be allowed by law to be in the UK so John Oliver Piers Morgan before him just pack up his bags and go back to The Devil's Island over there in the North Atlantic and leave us free speech loving folks that are building the products in the economy that he himself with his countrymen end up benefiting from the shut up and leave I'm gonna also go back to the step because remember I said that the original debt the debt that I look you me lated and caused Puerto Rico to default on the general obligation bond payments was a seventy billion dollars well the u.s. curse national debt in one day last week one day spiked by seventy two point eight billion so that's what it means to have the ability to just print money and just like create let on your own you know permissioned ledger to create seventy two point eight billion and new debt and to be outside a system whereby is not a rich permissionless ledger for all to participate equally here the United States government the Treasury has a permission ledger that only they can control and they get to create as much money as you want but you outside it in Puerto Rico you have to basically suffer you have to austerity you have to do whatever in order to uh you know even be let us allow you to economically exist if you want to understand how Bitcoin trades just put two charts overlay them one is the US dollar one is the Bitcoin price as the US dollar has moments of strength in the otherwise long multi decade bear market to oblivion you see pressure on Bitcoin as dollar will zoom this bear market and hits new all-time lows on the dollar index below seventy you'll see Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs but the dollar is the devil's currency the dollar is the currency that supports the establishment that supports the charlatans and you know it does have occasional strong days but the trend is to zero I notice a lot of people on YouTube really liked my quote about the lionfish being the predator the equivalent to the predator that the US dollar in this post Bretton Woods be out world post gold standard world of nineteen seventy one that they had no predator there's no competition to it let's discuss your tweet a little bit more about the lionfish because it has been retweeted now multiple times it's going viral as your insight in comparison to the lionfish it's now embraced by this community globally you're saying that the line fish when it was a shoe have no predators and predatory yeah it had an ecosystem that was balanced and yeah overpopulate and all now it got into the Atlantic and has no predators and it's become ubiquitous and uncontrollable so you're saying Bitcoin really has no predators no you totally mangled that lionfish I think it's the lionfish we sometimes call it the tiger fish it's a line I made that mistake last week I've corrected it's a lionfish it has loads of predators it's in harmony with the economy in the sea and the oceans of Asia Pacific then somebody dumped one into the ocean off of like Pensacola and now it's exploded in population because they have no known predators there but now it's like consuming all so they're able to just gobble gobble gobble gobble they dominate they are the Emperor's of the sea there because there's nobody who can compete with them and it's made a toxic environment because of that just like our global economy we have a toxic global economy because of the monetary system didn't allow competitors now Bitcoin has restored that that is a predator that has now been introduced into the monetary system Bitcoin is the apex predator now they're in there and you've got to us you know you've got to shape up you've got to start acting better if you're going to be a central bank competing with this new monetary system well said I couldn't agree more and it's a great analogy and you know people were you know we're gravitating toward it and I think it makes a heck of a lot of sense so you know the United States record amount of new debt added in boom times theoretically boom times and yet the government is issuing a record amounts of debt so who do they owe most of the debt to but China so I want to look at in these last like four minutes here at the future of what the a Chinese run more polls you know economic powerhouse might do about their bad debtor because of course here Puerto Rico or the bad debtors to the US mainland now us is bad debtor to China China will ban people with poor Social Credit from planes and trains starting in May Chinese citizens who rank low in the country's burgeoning Social Credit system will be in danger of being banned from buying plane or train tickets for up to a year according to statements recently released by the country's National Development and Reform Commission with the Social Credit system the Chinese government rates citizens based on things like criminal behavior and financial misdeeds but also what they by say and do those with low sports get have restrictions but if you're a bad debtor if you have a lot of debt and you haven't made enough payments you you are you get bad Social Credit so if you apply that on a geo-economic level like what is that gonna look like it's gonna look pretty bad so in other words like uber or eBay there's a rating that's generated not by fellow users but by the government and everyone in the country is given a rating by the government and if you do something that's anti-government like questioned that government your rating goes down if you lionize the government and salute the government and genuflect before the all-knowing glorious government you get a social rating boost and this is our each thing in China because on the way up during the capitalist boom they are all Adam Smith and free market but now that the debts become burdensome and their economy is shrinking it's back to Mao eliminate a few million you know you got to be capitalist all the way you just can't beat capitalist on the way up and totalitarian slaughtering folks on the way down oh sure buddy but while they were building manufacturing plants in order to feed American consumers it was all great but now that Americans owe them four trillion dollars let's see how they are because again I'm gonna turn to a story how they treat their own citizens previously the Chinese government had focused on restricting the travel of people with massive amounts of debt like echo and Faraday future founder giu Tang who made the Supreme People's Court blacklist late last year the system as it stands is opaque citizens are seemingly just as likely to be flagged for minor infractions like leaving bikes parked in a footpath or issuing apologies that are deemed insincere as major credit to falters like gia Chyna doesn't understand entrepreneurialism because a lot of times people get into debt because they start a company and it doesn't work and so those people need to be encouraged to try again because they are risk takers what Matt was saying I mean China is that we don't want risk takers we want obedient authoritarian loving bootlickers and that's not the way to build an economy so your economy that's shrinking because you're too far into debt it's not gonna go into freefall because you don't understand what it takes to be an entrepreneur here in Puerto Rico they're saying you know what we've got enough American kind of spirit here because we're close to the freaking Silicon Valley in New York and money center banks that we understand that you encourage entrepreneurialism and failure is not the negative stigma that you think it is it's the beginning of an entrepreneurial career to build an economy that's why this place is gonna succeed did you know the GDP of Puerto Rico is going to eclipse China within ten years because here they're not afraid to be entrepreneurs I can't believe we I've ever had an egg roll I can't stay anyway enough of that let's take a break and cool down a little bit and come back in the second half and see if it can make sense of this all don't go away welcome back with Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to Harry dent author and I guess you could say futurist one of the most well respected names in trance forecasting Harry welcome great to have you duhh yeah great to be here been following your work for quite a number of years and you've been the author of some really great books best-selling author the latest book we'll talk about your what you were presentation was here in Puerto Rico but I want to talk a little bit about your latest book zero hour and can you give us an overview what what's what's about yeah I mean you know we continue to talk about this financial crisis that is you know is inevitable governments are trying to push it off with quantitative easing and fake policies and it I think it's gonna come to head in the next few years so that's number one look out if you think 2008-2009 was bad this is gonna be worse because governments have stretched the stock market because you know 2008 crisis said and we had an extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve Bank Jim Geithner came in that came in with tarp and they came in with a bailout so they came in with an extrordinary basically just fill the tub back up with water and where do they get that out of thin air you can't create growth in productivity and wealth by printing money out of thin air but that's what they're doing it's a temporary measure now we're living on quantitative easing I mean it'd be one thing if they to come out with a million you know a trillion dollars when the first crash happened and then stop oh just to make sure the banking system didn't totally fall out but to constantly have the system perverted by free money negative and zero interest rates it perverts the system when we're just getting all this money's going into speculation it's not going to mini and economies so-called banana republics you know you America talks about its failed economies and they say you know if they got into debt monetization they're buying back their own debt and that's of course that's always a recipe for disaster now quantitative easing the only difference between debt monetization to quantitative easing is that quantitative easing purportedly from what they tell us has an expiration date but that expiration date never comes so isn't this just debt monetization it is governments are issuing unprecedent of debt and how are they doing this they're buying their own since the markets would never take it all and they're pushing the interest rates down to zero adjusted for inflation and sometimes negative so they're making it affordable for them to float all this debt by artificial means now it gets worse than that corporations are the only net buyers of stocks not not financial institutions not retail investors or foreign invested companies are the only net buyers out there running their own stocks they're issuing stocks they're buying them back to leverage the earnings per share in a slow growth economy GDP from 38 percent in the last nine years of this boom and yet stocks have gone up three hundred thirty one per se illegal to buy your back your own stock it should all of this should be exactly in the central banks also buying stocks right now Japan they're a little bit young Japan's running out of bonds to buy so they're buying their stock market and corporate bonds - I mean this is crazy is there a risk and you follow a cycle then you follow 80 year cycles and hundred year cycles you know let's talk about a multi hundred year cycle called feudalism is it possible that these banks central banks will buy back all the equity with this zero percent money to the point where you've got a few Oleg arcs with everything and a bunch of serfs that are with nothing what do you think about this why theory now your theory the economy likes to rebalance it likes to deleverage we've had the greatest debt bubble in history I can't even compare it to the one in the Roaring Twenties this is so much bigger debt causes financial asset bubbles acid bubbles have to burst I mean real estates getting so unaffordable that have did people in Hong Kong living in 66 square foot closet apartments that's crazy so so it's bad for the kind the economy likes to rebalance governments did not let that happen when it crashed in 2008 or 9 that was the Great Depression started economies like to rebalance that is the way capitalism actual so you weed out the losers out the lune and you have a business cycle and it's painful so bye-bye repudiating the business cycle by artificially keeping it going beyond this lifespan your review is now we're set up for a bigger problem in crash bigger than 2008 and it's coming pretty quickly Harry's yeah yeah III think they're running out of stimulus and in ammunition and and the final thing has been this tax cut from Tom this is more something for nothing corporate profits are the highest they've been in all of history compared to GDP and he's giving them a tax crack on Wall Street now he's rolled back a lot of the reforms okay some in the political arena would say this is what's needed because the banks are being constrained others would say well you know when they got rid of glass-steagall and they got rid of some of these other regulations it just gave them fuel to engage in a lot of predatory behavior how do you weigh in on this Bill Clinton repealed this it was set in place after the Great Depression to prevent it from happening again and then in the 90s politicians say oh we don't need this antiquated law that's exactly when we need it as soon as they knock that we got this great bubble the tech bubble now we've had bubble after bubble after bubble how many bubbles can you have bubbles only do one thing in history believe me I've studied them everyone they've burst and they don't correct they go down 90 plus percent they don't go down even 50 or 60 if we're gonna have the biggest bubble burst in history okay well here's a here's a question for you we're both attending a crypto conference there for know Rico and the crypto market has had a huge correction I think is that the nicest thing you could say about it in 2018 you are at a market historian you follow trends in cycles I've given let's say you're not a crypto expert or say but what does it smell like what does your instincts tell you where are we in this cycle with crypto Harry this looks exactly like the internet bubble the internet bobble was only one year at the end of the tech bubble from 95 to 2000 it came in the last year it was much greater it was went up eight to ten times and a little over a year and then it crashed 93 percent not not 60 not seventeen ninety three percent but that shook down to the to the solid companies and those companies turned around and end up trading the greatest boom in technology in history called the internet and Amazon went dropped five 50 from 113 and now it's at $1,600 so so to me this is the beginning of a technology revolution blockchain is real I don't know most of the coins but that is real and that the internet has gone as far as it can go in communication stuff we can't handle financial transactions and things of value so we need an internet 2.0 and that blockchain and it's just emerging but it's going to be volatile and is gonna be more this shake out and then you're gonna get down to the real company and that's that's the only way nature knows how 2,000 flowers boom and then pull out the rug and see who's still standing innovation was no central bank for Bitcoin no bailouts so your work you know I heard your presentation and you really focus in on cycles and I get you're like a kind of sewer of cycles like what I was listening to you speak today you're like I found a cycle recently it's this cycle and they're talking about the price of cucumbers in 1947 versus the replacing tires in 1993 and so you're really looking at prices and demographics so that's what drives your work well I was always a cycle guy I just happened to trip on demographics in the early 80s just before this massive baby boom way I said look at that Holy Smoke people have no idea what's about to hit our economy this generation of massive and they're gonna cause the greatest boom in history and so I came up with demographic cycles but I'm I wasn't a demographic expert at the time I became one because I realized this is important it is the most important cycle technology cycles are important again that's why this icy blockchain is like the internet on an 18 year lag that's the way I see it is developing this same way and we're in that early stage and it's gonna have to settle down and then it'll be a long hood and it'll be a big boy now cycles of course are predictable until they're not and you had an event in 2011 9/11 which really gave kind of threw everything upside down in a lot of ways the Federal Reserve Bank dropped interest rates dramatically and trying to restart the economy and how did that factor in because maybe you could call it a Black Swan okay which is a term from another author I hate the word Black Swamp okay new blood all right tell us Black Swan happens when you don't understand the cycle and what the way my work I started with demographic very powerful cycles nobody's ever done that in economic then that 911 hit and it changed the stock market the stock market was only going up half as much and that's what happens in geopolitical cycles when the world gets risky the do brisk premium brings down stock valuation so I added that cycle and then later I added the technology cycle and finally I added a boom bust cycle around sunspots of all things and it's very good cycle right sunspots it sounds a bit arcane if it works it works right words and 88% of recessions happenin down sunspot cycle 11 out of 11 major financial crises in the down cycle there's no way that's a call so say at the top of your presentation that human nature is never gonna change you can't fight nature and when governments are trying to which is not good right before the French Revolution there's a huge volcano I believe in Iceland which caused the price of bread to go up because of the difficulty in growing the wheat in France and when the bread got to a certain price it triggered a revolution the links are there but you have to be disciplined to find them and so your work is to have a discipline to find them what's the biggest risk for you what's the biggest challenge you have because here you know we have about a minute you know I've been a nap you know you what are you what are you constantly battling as as an analyst what's your biggest risk that you haven't real question about it is this quantitative easing the central banks have hijacked the free market system which are natural forces that's what I study I've studied that know that better than anybody in the world but now they take over and while demographics doesn't matter as much when they're just constantly pumping money and then people are constantly speculating and do all the stuff and negative interest rates and zero interest rates my models don't work is good so so but but the way our discipline works every time something happens that I don't anticipate with my present model I know I've got to come up with a new cycle or new model so I'm really how do I incorporate this quantitative easing but this has never been done before where you just literally fight the natural cycle I mean like Mario Draghi said the kitchen sink I mean trying as much money as it takes that's insanity but they're doing it right to be continued on that front finally now you live in Puerto Rico yep and you were not part of the wave that come in with the John Paulson's and the feeder ships have come in kind of recently you've been here for 20 years 25 years well I've been coming here coming 28 years I've been living here for about two so I was kind of part of that way but but I I came here because I discovered Calabrian ba that's two beautiful islands off here and I bought a big Laden Culebra right now the you've been you've met the crypto community and they are very excited to be here they think this could be a hot spot for innovation of Puerto Rico first it's gonna be challenges how would you rate the prospects for that happening for crypto and Bitcoin in Puerto Rico to Puerto Rico to become a hotspot I think it's perfect because it's a way to have a test case you know that this country's small enough and in their country in the industry still in its infancy where you can really prove the concept out you know like like like to say they want to buy a plan and have a crypto city you know I think that's a great idea they can pull it off because you know it's not a country it's a I know it's a territory of a bigger country trying of a country kind of politically are they gonna overcome those challenges or well again you know the government welcomes this I think they need a shot in the arm and the pharma industry was the oval and now that's gone got tax incentives so so they need this and they're gonna support it my only question okay because I'm in demographics okay Twitter Rico's lost 15% of the population is heading towards 20% can they survive that demographic hit and do these people come back because that's a big demographic only survive especially after this hurricane well leave it on that cliffhanger Harrington thanks so much for being on the Kaiser plan alright well that's gonna do it for this edition of the guy's a report with me mask guys are in Stacy Herbert like to think arrest Dent author's latest book is called zero hour if you want to catch us on Twitter it's guys the report until next time bye
