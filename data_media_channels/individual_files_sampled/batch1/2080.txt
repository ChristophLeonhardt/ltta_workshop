I've had some off the raid conversations with some journalists where they said okay you seem like you're okay but really really what do you think and I said no I what I'm saying really is what I think I I believe in this country I believe in the American people I believe that people are more good than bad I believe tragic things happen i think there's evil in the world but i think that at the end of the day if we work hard and if we're true to those things in us that feel true and feel right that the world gets a little better each time that's what this presence is tried to be about and so this is not just a matter of no drama Obama this is this is what I really believe it is true that behind closed doors I Chris more than I do oh and sometimes I get mad and frustrated like everybody else's but at my core I think we're going to be okay we just have to fight for it we have to work for it and not take it for granted and I know that you will help us do this thank you very much press for good luck
