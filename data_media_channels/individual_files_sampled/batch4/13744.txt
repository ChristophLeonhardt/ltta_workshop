serious acrimony has now broken out among conservatives about whether to vote for Donald Trump as I've made clear as of now I have no intention of voting for Trump he's personally unpalatable of course he's a serial adulterer who brags about sleeping with married women and says he doesn't repent he's an extreme narcissist with delusion of grandeur he's not conservative he thinks Planned Parenthood is great work he doesn't have coherent foreign policy he wants to leave entitlement programs in place he supports tariffs and government subsidies he doesn't care if Republicans lose the Senate he has nothing to say about religious freedom for business owners and that's just the start he's volatile and he's nasties mock prisoners of war and disabled journalists and compared his own sacrifices to those of gold star families and gone soft on the KKK he lies constantly about nearly everything just as importantly Trump is doing serious brand damage to conservatism he's poisoning the well with female voters look at the polls and minorities and young people many ardent conservatives have been co-opted into lying for him and perverting their own conservatism in order to stop Hillary Clinton if Trump wins he'll turn conservatism into trumpism if he loses and conservatives go along for the ride he'll sunk conservatism for an entire generation of voters not supporting Trump is a perfectly defensible position but-but-but-but it is a tough call on the other hand I totally understand and I fully sympathize with people who say they have to hold their nose and vote for Trump in order to stop Hillary she will be a full-scale disaster she will appoint the fifth Supreme Court justice to get the first and second amendments she will cripple our military she'll cram down tax increases she'll use the regulatory infrastructure to snap the knees of American industry and conduct basically raids against religious people choosing Trump over Hillary is an absolutely perfectly defensible position but it is a tough call every morning these days I really do this is true I asked myself the same question which is more costly to America a possible loss of conservatism to trumpism or or another four years of Hillary Clinton another four years of Hillary Clinton's radical destruction which could deal the deathblow to America's freedoms it's a very serious question and good people are gonna come down on both sides of it I myself have felt compelled to come down on both sides of it at one time or another but acknowledging that the choice isn't easy seems like a stretch for a lot of commentators some people insist that if you forego the Trump train that makes you a traitor in order to reach that conclusion they either ignore Trump's foibles or they by about what a wonderful guy what a wonderful conservative he is some people on the other side they insist that if you jump on the Trump train that makes you a traitor in order to reach that conclusion some of them downplay Clinton's evils or exaggerate from riskiness here's what does make you a traitor to conservatism if you live for Trump or you lied to your audience that he's a serious conservative lying isn't just a non-conservative it's actually immoral but neither voting for Trump nor refusing to vote for Trump makes you a traitor to conservatism nobody knows the answer to the hypothetical I posed to myself each morning because nobody has a crystal ball we don't know how bad things will be under Trump we don't know how bad things will be under Clinton we don't know what will happen to the future of the conservative movement but one thing is certain if we don't recognize that the choice is tough thanks to trump's utterly incomprehensible foolishness and vitriol and hillary clinton's radical leftist corruption we're not taking the question seriously enough more importantly we're destined to go to war with our own ideological allies after the election is over and there's no need for that war our war should be on behalf of conservatism trump has divided conservatives on the proper tactics in the selection but once November 9th hits we're all on the same page again we either have to stop leftist policies from President Trump or from President Clinton we'll need to be allies the first step should be recognizing the goodwill of people who fight alongside us even if we don't make the same risk calculations with regard to a conservative future i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show okay so it turns out there's been some news there are things to talk about today there's things to talk about today so we'll launch right off the bat right off the bat this today will be an epic episode of good trump bad Trump all right thank you - of course Brandon Snipes for providing us the theme for good trump bad Trump which one will it be today well there is actually plenty of good Trump there actually is plenty of good Trump and I mean really good Trump he gave I thought the best speech of his entire career the best speech of his political campaign last night I thought it was truly a stellar speech I'm not exaggerating I thought his speech last night was great I thought it was great great great I have to start of course we're on Facebook live so that means I have to front-load the the material that people are tuning in for today and that of course is the announcements that Trump is shaking up his campaign and here is where we get bad Trump Oh sad okay so let's begin let's begin with the with the campaign shake-up today so here's what we know about the campaign shake-up today Stephen cabana and the former chairman of Breitbart news and by former I mean like from 30 seconds ago he is he is now going to be the new Trump campaign Chairman the new Trump campaign manager is a gal named Kelly Ann Conway Kelly Ann Conway used to be the kind of the mouthpiece for the Mercer family the Mercer family are some of the bigger Republican donors in politics I think they were the single largest political donor in this election cycle they give a bunch of money to Cruz and now they're gonna give a bunch of money to Trump she used to be the mouthpiece for them now she's moving over to the Trump campaign here's what you need to know about all of this so first I'm gonna try and remove myself okay it's tough for me I'll admit it freely and openly I think that Steve Bannon is one of the worse people I know I think Steve Bannon is a bad guy I think he's vicious I think he's aggressive I think he's self-aggrandizing I think he has no interest in principle I think he has interest only in his in his personal power okay but I'm gonna try and put that aside is this a good pick for the Trump campaign so if the last two days are an indicator of what Bannon can do it's not just a good pick for Trump it's actually a very good pick for Trump the last two days have been good Trump the last two days are what people thought they were getting in the primaries with Donald Trump the last few days have been Trump speaking very very well on Isis and then speaking very very well on crime and we'll get to all that in a minute it's also prevented Trump from making a lot of big boo boos right a lot of the a lot of the big boo boos that Trump usually makes I mean by this point he usually has stuck his foot up his up his butt in some way or another he hasn't done that for 48 hours I know that our standards have lowered to the point where it's a big shock when a 70 year old man doesn't step in a pile of crap for 48 hours but that is where our standards are he hasn't for 48 hours and he's given a couple of actually very good speeches he's actually done a couple of very good things here's what Steve's skillset comes to bear with Trump so Steve is good at handling talent he's handled Sarah Palin before he's dealt with Michele Bachmann before he was he was friendly with Andrew Breitbart of course what he does with talent is he tends to double them down he tries to tell talent that they need to be more than they need to be more authentically them with Trump that's a better tactic than trying to turn him and rein him in and trying to turn him into Mitt Romney's never gonna be Mitt Romney nor should he want to be Mitt Romney he's not capable of that so abandon will do is he'll double Trump down that has its good aspects it also has its bad aspects the good aspects are when Trump is on like he has been the last couple of days it's quite good even if I disagree with him on a lot of stuff the bad aspect is that Trump is as I've said before a category five turn tornado every so often he's liable to just blow through town and wreck everything and leave dead people in his wake I mean it's it's it's that bad I don't think that Steve is capable of stopping the turd tornado that is Trump but there are some ancillary points to be made here about conservative media and about the future of the conservative movement that I think are more important than ban in specific impact on the Trump campaign as I say I think he could have maybe a beneficial impact on the Trump campaign so first let me explain to you who Steve Bannon is and why I know Steve ban and so I've known Steve Antin longer than I was actually at Breitbart and and Steve knows me longer than he was a Breitbart actually so Steve Bannon turned Trump it turned turned Breitbart news into Trump's personal Pravda to understand what this means understand I was friends with Andrew Breitbart since the time I was 17 years old I worked very very closely with Andrew Breitbart on a number of different projects for many many years before he hired me in 2012 we were very friendly we used to I am and speak all the time remember my parents house for dinner I mean Andrew and I we're good friends Breitbart news was designed to be a fighting media site that's what it was designed to do is design to fight bullies and under the auspices of Steve Annan as he became more and more tied to Trump it became simply a trump Pravda site you remember back in March I quit Breitbart over the the incident with Michelle fields and a lot of people think that that incident was exaggerated nothing really that bad happened but that doesn't matter okay the part of the story that actually matters is that Michelle fields was indeed grabbed by Corey Lewandowski and Breitbart basically gasps let her Breitbart decided today we're gonna come out in favor of Trump and say not that nothing bad had happened but that she'd never even been grabbed that she was basically making it up it never happened Cory Lewandowski hadn't grabbed her and then you spread that rumor everywhere undercut your own reporters smear your own reporter is basically crazy in order to get in closer with Trump I quit over that and here's the statement that I issue what I said was Andrew Breitbart builds his life and career on one mission fight the bullies but Andrews life mission has been betrayed indeed Breitbart news under the chairmanship of Steve Bannon has put a stake through the heart of Andrews legacy in my opinion Steve Bannon is a bully and has sold out Andrews mission in order to back another bully donald trump has shaped the company in to Trump's personal Pravda the facts are undeniable Breitbart news has become precisely the reverse of what Andrew would have wanted Steve Bannon and those who follow his lead should be ashamed of themselves okay that looks pretty good today because that's exactly what it was he turned it into Trump's personal probs they denied this at the time no no no no that they ran a whole big piece about how I was a traitor to the cause for leaving and for pointing out that it's bad when publications don't back their own reporters out of personal loyalty to a political candidate that makes them a propaganda outlet not a news outlet you know Trump is not a conservative Andrew knew Trump was not a conservative he never would have provided the Worshipful coverage of Donald Trump's nationalist populist agenda the Breitbart did Andrew didn't like bullies Trump is a bully but obviously Bannon is too so doesn't really matter okay so that's number one that you need to know about ban and second if you think Bannon is in this for Trump he's not in it for Trump he's in it for Bannon okay the way that Steve works and just look at his political career he became prominent when he did a really crappy documentary called generation zero and it is I mean it's an egregious ly bad documentary it's the kind of documents remade by an amateur where you have a bunch of where you have a bunch of what we have a bunch of time-lapse photography to demonstrate draw and go black and whites demonstrate ramen you have stock footage of clowns hitting each other really this is the kind of thing that was in his film he he got some coverage for this got on Fox News he was on Sean Hannity's friends with Sean he began elevating his profile after he attached himself to Michelle Bachman with another documentary called fire from the heartland and then he did another documentary after he insinuated himself in with with Sarah Palin he made another crappy documentary called the undefeated and again it's a really really crappy documentary but the point was he was now associated with Sarah Palin and this was now his calling card because Sarah Palin was a hot commodity in 2011 wretches fresh off of the 2008 race people still big fans of Sarah Palin this is before she sort of became parody of herself and been and attached himself to her and sort of rode her coattails and presumably kept telling her everything she was doing was wonderful until she became sort of the mockery that she's become and I don't think it's a coincidence that Palin was the first tea partier to really endorse Trump he began appearing on Fox News fairly regularly and he met Andrew Breitbart he gave Andrew Breitbart some office space and he lent Andrew Breitbart the office space which Andrew was grateful for and then after Andrew died Larry so love who was Andrew Breitbart partner decided okay I'm gonna make band in the chairman of the company there are a lot of people inside the company who I think we're not I was one of them I was not happy the Bandon was made chairman of the company because I had experiences with Bannen before but in any case he made him chairman of the company and things were fine for a while because Steve was Steve's a very smart guy he's a bright guy when the Trump campaign began when the Trump campaign began that's when things began to go sideways because at that point it became clear that Steve who was the guiding force at Breitbart now had decided that it was very important that that Trump be stumped for under virtually all circumstances so turned into Trump probs he denied that it was turning into Trump prob he didn't personally I mean he essentially did but but the website the website definitely tried to maintain this veneer of we're not from Pravda and now of course it's clear they weren't Trump Pravda in fact half the staff is now moving over there pairs a report today that Matthew boiled their lead Washington reporter is gonna be working for Trump John Pollack who was the the in-house counsel and former editor-in-chief he had been trying to get a speech writing job with Trump okay so they're always very close and it was all for Steve's personal self aggrandizement I also have some and from other sources this is not from me that the the chief investors in Breitbart news are people called the Mercer's Robert Mercer is a hedge fund manager and they gave an enormous amounts of money to Templars they started a super PAC for Ted Cruz give it a lot of money to the Ted Cruz super PAC there are also the lead investors in Breitbart news well as the campaign went on other people who were spending money on the Cruz campaign went to the Mercer family whose spokesperson was Kellyanne Conway the new campaign manager for Trump and they said to Kellyanne Conway the Mercer's guys what are you doing you're spending like tens of millions of dollars on Cruz and you also spent money on Breitbart why is your right hand fighting with your left hand why is Breitbart trying to take out Cruz and push Trump and the Mercer family was telling people no no Bannon isn't anti Trump they were telling people no Breitbart news isn't anti Trump now anyone who is watching Breitbart news knew they mail or anti Cruz everybody who's watching Breitbart news knew that it was a pro Trump outlet at that point but presumably present I mean I can't imagine any other way the Mercer's got this impression presumably Bannon was telling them all the way through it's not that we're Pro Trump we're not we're just we're treating everybody equally yeah that's kind of bad stuff Breitbart staff as I mentioned lusts after Trump involvement which is important under bannon's leadership Breitbart also transferred into in in following Trump they transferred into the sort of milo gianopolous white supremacist alt-right garbage version of the right-wing that's nothing to do with constitutional conservatism and and that I think is a betrayal of Andrews memory also it's worth noting and here's where we get into the the serious stuff yeah I've speculated that this could be for Steve what Steve's play well I mean play number one could be Trump wins and now he's the chief of staff and I have to go into hiding that's play number one plate number two is Trump loses and at that point Steve uses Trump and all of his newfound media connections who have become very loyal to Trump and builds a new network and builds a new network and that's speculation but Steve's a very smart guy and I would imagine that he's thought along those lines because he doesn't like to enter scenarios where it's a Lou where it's where it's a win-lose where where he can lose that's a no lose scenario if he wins then he's in the White House if he loses then he gets to build this big new network and blame people like me for Trump losing even though he was the one in charge of the failing Trump campaign okay so a couple of important points here and as I mentioned I think the ban is legitimately sinister figure but there are some more important points than just Trump hiring sinister figures he's hired sinister figures before for goodness sake he's hired Paul Manafort who may be on the Kremlin's payroll he is he's a very close relationship with Roger stone one of the sleaziest people in American politics this would be nothing new here is where we get dicey here is where we get dicey the place where we get to I see is the the point that Trump tried to make the other day so here's Donald Trump talking about how he's sick of the media Dolan or political complex and you saw him at the left here do we have this clip won or some encrusted old politician says they opposed our campaign or some big-time lobbyist says they oppose the campaign of Trump I wear their opposition as a badge of honor because it means I'm fighting for real change not just partisan change where everybody else gets rich but you a rigged rigged system remember it I said it first I'll probably be saying it for a long time but eventually we're gonna break that system media donor political class right he just hired the head of a major major political website to run his campaign ok Breitbart has built itself on the back of Trump I mean they went from like 30 million pageviews in 22 months in like 2012-2013 so now 200 million pageviews largely on the back of trumpism largely on the back of Trump and you know that's his prerogative but it does give the lie to the idea that there's media corruption only on one side of the aisle because the fact is this the Trump campaign has been claiming that there's this whole vast swath of media on the left who refuse to acknowledge their own bias and then go out there and stump for Democrats that is 100% true that is also exactly what Breitbart is that's exactly what Breitbart has become Breitbart was a propaganda outlet for Donald Trump they refused to acknowledge it and now they are part and parcel of the Trump pain and it's really nasty it's really bad andrew breitbart wrote large large segments in his book righteous indignation about the evils of the what he called the Democrat media complex he said that was a really nasty thing to have these people working hand in glove the idea was not to build a Trump media complex that was not the idea but that's exactly what what Bannen has created here and again it demonstrates the corruption within conservatism the the lust for power that allows people to sell out their principles and it really is it really is quite ugly again that may not be a bad move for Trump so now that we've put all of that information aside now that's all on the table and I've tried to be objective as I can I'm admittedly not objective about this now that we've put that aside now that we've said you know maybe Trump is capable of maybe there's a good move for Trump now I want to talk about good Trump but for
