they want to open your borders let people in illegally they want to give them cars they want to give them driver's licenses the Democrats want caravans they like the caravans a lot of people say I wonder who started that Caravan I don't think we like sanctuary cities up here by the way a lot of people in California you don't want to mean that they're writing that for statements for lies that was just a sampling of the president's days long spree of conspiracy theories and lies centered on illegal border crossings and a caravan of migrants making its way north through Mexico all part of an apparent last-minute push to rally his base before the midterm elections and the president took it a step further just in the last hour with a new set of baseless accusations I thought you should do John go into the middle of the caravan take your cameras and search okay thank you John take your camera go into the middle you're gonna find ms-13 you're gonna find Middle Eastern you're gonna find everything and guess what we're not allowing them in our country we want safety Brett Kareem Nick and Mike are with us so here's the deal Mike lipika he's in charge of the borders he's the president Republicans control the White House the Senate and the house so Republicans are in charge of everything that happens when it comes to immigration right Nicole do you think he hates these pictures of the caravans he loves these pictures of the caravans they talk about political Hey he wants them to keep marching towards the border right up until Election Day and and and once again you know that the demonization of people who are mostly coming here to escape the lives that they had and looking for a better one and you go into the middle and you'll find Middle Eastern okay you mean like Middle Eastern people who murdered a Washington Post columnist in cold blood in an embassy in Istanbul that you compare like walk in and out of like a drive-through at a fast food place come on there is something you know sometimes I wonder how low we've fallen and you look at Jeb Bush getting drummed out of the Republican primary for calling illegal immigration an act of love people coming here for a better country i remember george w bush's struggles with his own party when he championed comprehensive immigration reform along the lines of what taken in the late Ted Kennedy in the late John McCain envisioned and you think about the fact that some if they were to enter our country only then would they become illegal immigrants right now they're migrants they're not illegal immigrants in this country because not in this country and some of them are asylum seekers so they're not what they're being described as and as mike lupica said they're being watched this image and we didn't play it for a reason today because it is being watched like a hurricane on other networks to drum up fear about illegal they are not that is not a picture of illegal immigrants no this is a picture of desperate people who want to make better lives for themselves in the United States not so dissimilar from the desperate people who were my ancestors who came to this country on 120 years ago almost anyone any American has someone like that in in their background and whether they're walking over a border or coming on a ship does it make that much difference I would challenge anyone to find a Middle Eastern terrorist among among those people by the way they're a caravan quote-unquote for their own safety because Mexico they're areas of Mexico that are dangerous to go through but you know you mentioned George W Bush John McCain take it back George HW Bush Ronald Reagan a long tradition of Republican leaders who understood that this country was built by immigrants and benefits from immigrants you know it's absolutely right he's absolutely right we do have to have borders and we have to have seas and he's in charge of them but we also have a foreign policy that ought to be working with Honduras want to be working with El Salvador or other troubled Central American country countries to improve their economies to expand trade to expand opportunities there and to have a regularize flow of immigration because by the way we're an empty country with a negative population or declining demographics and we could use some more immigrants what are how do you cover the lies in the volume that he turns them out there's there's a great piece in The Washington Post plumb-line about sort of the impotent rage over the border Paul Waldman writes it could lead to something drastic Republicans control every center of power in Washington so how is it that despite their complete lack of power Democrats are managing to stop Trump from implementing his terrific immigration plan the answer is that they aren't the reason Trump hasn't signed immigration legislation is that he can't get Republicans themselves to agree on a set of reforms Trump can't even get Republicans to agree to fund a border wall the centerpiece of this presidential campaign and actually let me play just how poor important the border wall was to his presidential campaign we will build a wall walls to walls do what we are going to build the wall and yes we will build the wall number one are you ready are you ready we will build a great wall along the southern border your paper did a great report on how he was a fraud in terms of describing himself as self-made he's also a fraud as a politician then saying he was gonna build a wall there's no wall look the president's strategy here and it's an old one is to create a sense of threat externally when he can't find one internally when the GOP is as powerful as it's ever been around the country and you can fight it with facts right the facts are there is actually already a wall in their border right there's a fence if you see b-roll on TV of the fence there's already a fence there and that's the point we have our border it is pretty well policed our border policy is not a disaster and the people in that caravan there are 3,000 miles away and if George Sarris wants to get them here by election day you know you need like five 747s to do it it's not gonna it's a little bit it is also part of a pattern of dehumanizing some of the most defenseless and voiceless the people that don't have a lot I mean Saudi Arabia has a lobby in Washington a powerful and effective one he also in a leaked memo that your paper reported on this morning there's a draft policy at the agencies that would really eliminate or redefine out of existence transgender people yeah which is really disturbing because now you have transgender people are probably worrying about their future in this in this country is with Donald Trump now as president and it is and this is what he does he do manizer because it riles up his base and he had said for a long time this was going to be his closing argument for the midterms even when we were seeing children being separated from their families at the border he thought that was wonderful he thought that was great and we had heard rumors about yeah you know what I want to go even deeper on immigration and so after two years being in power having everything as you just said Republicans having everything they don't have anything to sell their tax cuts is deeply unpopular they try to take for health care away from millions of people when pre-existing care is really important he brought up California how people were taking to the streets in California I was in California on canvas in California 45 which is in very red Orange County and it is a district that has never been held by a Democrat they went back as 90 years they never saw a Democrat they never had crowd there and now you have Katie Porter who is being very competitive and what do they care about the economy they care about health care and they care about oil drilling but you know you're touching on something that's that's very important and I frankly I'm not hearing it enough on the Democratic side which is if Democrats are gonna win not just in November but in 2020 the campaign has to be centered on hope and too much of the Democratic message is rage it's relitigated of what happened in 2016 it's speculation on questions to which we do not yet know the answer in terms of the connection the connection with with Russia and that's that's problematic so a Democrat right I have to push back on it because I think that I just went to California 45 to canvass and be with our members and I'm gonna be going across the country and really importance in important district that's not what they're talking about nobody mentioned that to me when I was talking to folks when I was knocking on doors and asking people you know if they if they had voted already because you know California's already voting that's not what they told me they actually mentioned health care the environment and the tax cuts I think maybe you're talking about national Democrats you're hearing your ground truth you're talking about a national message to Washington that's exactly right and right now you're not really hearing you're just not really hearing I mean I know it's there I know their policy papers I know their plans but it's not front and center of the Democratic message and listen the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 1969 I don't hear enough Democrats grappling with that fact you can make exceptions you can point out to real real weaknesses in the economy that's a reality Democrats aren't dealing
