1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
and my hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the president like coming</font>

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,290
in takes a similarly constructive

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,599
approach finding areas where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,990
cooperate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Russia where our values</font>

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,910
and interests align but that the

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,619
president-elect also is willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand</font>

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,560
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Russia where they are deviating</font>

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,060
from our values and international norms

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,190
and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect that the</font>

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,969
president-elect will follow exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

11
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:43,410
blueprint or our approach but my hope is

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,500
is that he does not simply take a real

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,250
politic approach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,079
know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just cut some deals with</font>

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,829
Russia even if it hurts people or even

16
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,780
if it violates international norms or

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,000
even if it leaves smaller countries

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,189
vulnerable or creates long-term problems

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,580
in regions like Syria that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just do</font>

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever is convenient at the time</font>
