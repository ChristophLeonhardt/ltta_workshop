I THINK THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS DOING PRETTY WELL IT SEEMS TO ME OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS. A LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT COMES BACK FROM THE FBI. I THINK JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS DOING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW. WE SPOKE AND THAT'S MOVING ALONG NICELY BUT I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT WITH GOING ON WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH. I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO INTERRUPT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH. AND I THINK THE PROCESS, I MUST SAY HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE A VOTE BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND IT WILL BE A POSITIVE VOTE. BUT IT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON WHAT COMES BACK FROM THE FBI. THE FBI IS WORKING, WORKING VERY HARD AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I THINK HE WAS FIGHTING PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING VERY TOUGH CHARGES AGAINST HIM, AND I THOUGHT HE DID VERY WELL. I REALLY DID. HE IS FIGHTING VERY HARD FOR HIS REPUTATION, FOR HIS FAMILY. IT WAS TOUGH STUFF. I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE STUFF FOR A LONG TIME. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH. IT IS A HIGH-QUALITY PERSON, THIS IS A NUMBER ONE STUDENT, TOP INTELLECT. HE'S NEVER GONE THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I THINK YOU DID VERY WELL. I THINK IT'LL BE TOTALLY IMPARTIAL, HE'S A GREAT JUDGE, HE IS KNOWN AS A GREAT JUDGE. IF THERE IS ONE DISAPPOINTMENT, I DON'T THINK THAT YOU PEOPLE COVERED IN ASPECT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT, AND THAT IS WHAT HE'S DONE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. IF YOU GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL AND GOING BACK TO COLLEGE, WHAT HAS HE DONE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS? HE HAS BEEN SPECTACULAR. HE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCES SUCCESS. I HEARD LINDSAY SAY THAT AND IT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING. I WAS IN TENNESSEE LAST NIGHT AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THOSE PEOPLE, WE HAD A SOLD-OUT ARENA WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE, EVERYWHERE I GO I'M GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA, THE SAME THING. THEY ARE SO IN FAVOR OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH, NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S LIKE A RALLYING CRY FOR THE REPUBLICANS. THEY ARE SO IN FAVOR OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. MELANIA IS IN AFRICA. I JUST SAW ON TELEVISION OR WALKING OUT OF THE PLANE. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SAYING HELLO TO THE KIDS. SHE IS REALLY DOING A GREAT JOB AS FIRST LADY. I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE FBI. THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH REPORTS. THEY'LL BE BACK VERY SOON. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A SECOND TIME? THIS WAS LINDSAY'S IDEA, LINDSEY IS A FRIEND OF MINE AT LEAST FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND HE HAS DONE A GREAT THING AND A GREAT SERVICE FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT I HAVE TO SAY I REALLY THINK THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO BE ACCEPTED AND VOTED ON AND POSITIVELY VOTED ON BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE FBI SAYS. THEY'LL COME BACK WITH A REPORT. IT'S A TOUGH THING GOING ON. IF YOU CAN BE AN EXEMPLARY PERSON FOR 35 YEARS AND THEN SOMEBODY COMES IN THEY SAY YOU DID THIS OR THAT AND THEY GIVE THREE WITNESSES AT THIS POINT WHO DO NOT CORROBORATE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, IT'S A VERY SCARY SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. MY WHOLE LIFE, I'VE HEARD YOU'RE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. BUT NOW YOU'RE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. THAT IS A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT STANDARD. I SAY THAT IT'S A VERY SCARY TIME FOR YOUNG MEN IN AMERICA WHEN YOU CAN BE GUILTY OF SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY NOT BE GUILTY OF. THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS MUCH MORE TO DO THAN EVEN THE APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. IF IT REALLY DOES. YOU CAN BE SOMEBODY THAT WAS PERFECT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND SOMEBODY COULD ACCUSE YOU OF SOMETHING. DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE A WOMAN, BUT SOMEBODY COULD ACCUSE YOU OF SOMETHING AND YOU ARE GUILTY. YOU ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. THAT IS ONE OF THE VERY, VERY BAD THINGS THAT'S TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW. THERE'S NOT A MESSAGE NOW BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE A MESSAGE BY THE END OF THE WEEK. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. HE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON, HE'S AN OUTSTANDING MAN AND FOR HIS SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF HIS FAMILY, I HOPE HE DOES WELL. I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY BRUTALLY TREATED. I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO TALK LATER. I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO INTERRUPT WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS PROCESS. THAT'S FINE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO INTERRUPT THE PROCESS. I DON'T DRINK, I'VE NEVER HAD A DRINK. I DON'T DRINK BEER, I'VE NEVER HAD A BEER. I'M NOT SAYING GOOD OR BAD, SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT. I JUST CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT FOR A LOT OF REASONS. I THINK I REMEMBER MY COLLEGE DAYS, EVERYBODY WAS DRINKING. IT WAS NORMAL. I WAS ABNORMAL. IT WAS TOTALLY NORMAL, EVERYBODY WAS DRINKING AND I USED TO DRINK A LOT OF BEER. AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG, I JUST DIDN'T CHOOSE TO DO THAT.
