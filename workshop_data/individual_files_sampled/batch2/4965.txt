the children the children can be taken care of quickly beautifully and immediately the Democrats forced that law upon our nation I hate it I hate to see separation of parents and children the Democrats can come to us as they actually are in all fairness we are talking to them and they can change the whole border security but there's no law that says families have to be separated at the border damage to the laws now I want the lowest to be beautiful humane but strong I don't want bad people coming in I don't want drugs coming in and we can solve that problem in one meeting tell the Democrats your friends to call me your friends the Democrats there are only two explanations for what you just heard from the president either the president isn't briefed about what's going on at the border ding-ding-ding or he's lying responsible here are the facts forcibly separating children from their parents at the border is not is not a democratic law it's a policy put in place for the Trump administration full stop and that Trump administration policy has resulted in 2000 children being taken from their parents over a six-week period from mid-april through the end of May in case that number is hard to visualize let's put a face to it this photo was taken on Tuesday in McAllen Texas a two-year-old Honduran child seeking asylum in our country sobbing as her mother is searched and detained at the border the caption on this image from Getty reads the next stop and their arduous journey one that began one month and some 1,500 miles earlier will be a US Customs and Border Protection processing center where they will be forcibly separated in keeping with President Trump's new zero-tolerance immigration policy joining us now is a rebel Sharpton president of the National Action Network and host of politics nation here on MSNBC we have a lot of conversations about politics and about what kind of country we want to be when we see the attacks on the Justice Department in tax on the intelligence community the bald-faced lies coming out of the president's mind but not very many things make me wonder what the hell are we doing what the hell are we doing I think a lot of us are wondering that when you saw this picture you just showed of a to yo kid watching his mother frisk when you then see not only a distortion of facts around the law of the law that the Democrats put in or President Obama put in did not require you to separate children the law Clinton had I mean no president but the thing that really outrages a lot of us in the clergy is for the Attorney General to stand up there and use the Bible to justify something as wicked and reprehensible as what they're doing and use a biblical verse that they use to try and justify slavery I mean he should have just said you know slave obey your master cause that's the biblical reference he was making and it is not the right interpretation of the Bible you know I spent much of the day we're putting together clergy group to go down there and attempt to visit these children because they should at least have a clergy visit and talk to people I'm gonna see if he lets us visit people they let gangsters see clergy I'm going to see if they'll let children see me let me get some more facts out there hang on there gay rights you so filled bump has a piece that I just want to keep explaining the the the craven nature of the lies the president is telling right there so so so here again on the policy how we got here the separation policy is a function of decisions made by Trump and his team the key shift here is good is to go to criminal prosecution of the parents that are caught combined with the practice of not releasing them for a family being released on bond allowed the parents and the children to stay together if no bond is granted the child is separated from a parent because the parent goes into criminal detention so did you read the story about the five-year-old boy from Honduras who brought scribbles little little notes that are he calls pictures of his family and he's now sleeping with them under his pillow at night as he cries himself to sleep and one of these engine facilities so that's where we are because of this policy and I think it's just so important that we remember that this does not require legislation to be fixed this could be handled by DHS by reversing this policy and it is a crisis of America's own invention it is taxing a system that was never meant to handle this type of overflow of children mean look at that that two year-olds commit to that back up okay that two year olds raised in Honduras probably doesn't speak English it has very minimal language skills how do you explain to her what is happening and also remember that the reason these migrants are coming is because they are seeking asylum in the United States because something that is happening in their home country is so bad so dangerous that they have risked this journey to the United States in order to find freedom and safety and instead what we're doing is taking these children away from them oh we still America when you see these pictures unfortunately there's a lot of ugly stuff having in America so we're not the best of America when we see these pictures without the America that we all want us to be worthy the words in a statute no no I mean we're we're it's it's this is a a self-imposed humanitarian crisis unfolding in front of all of our eyes and it's obviously this is Jeff Sessions policy this is why does Jeff Sessions put up with Donald Trump's abuse why does he stay in the job why does he want to still be there when there's such a thing with tasks to be running the Department of Justice this is why when there's Jeff Sessions is the ultimate restriction est√°ndares the kind of policies wanted to impose for a long time I'll just set out what kind of Paul but I will say this I've loved the fact that there's clergy that are going to go down there but I think they need something else in addition to clergy some of the Joe Scarborough raise this morning I'll say because I think it's super important we need a bunch of lawyers we ought to get on a bunch of planes get down there and get you out and get down to those border towns these people need lawyers these feel any mother's to go down there and hold these babies a lot of things but then you know maybe legal representation right now and I don't have a law degree if I had one I would I would be IV rounding up my friends at the law firms and saying let's get on planes to get down there and start fighting some fights for these people because they need that I agree with that and I think a lot of these civil rights groups that we've been talking to are going to provide the law but the thing is you again are talking about children who don't know what they need they're in a strange land most of them with a strange language who don't know what they need they're basically imprisoned we're in prison insane and that's the look that attorney general sessions is going for when he talks about deterrent he looks at that little Honduran kid and says good Crale everybody's looking at this and that will teach you not to come into the country it's a power-play it's ugly it's unconscionable and it's on a mirror it's a disgrace and you know a couple of candidates for the FBI position who walked away told me that in their interviews with Jeff Sessions I said well what was he looking for they said he really wasn't that interested in the FBI he was interested in securing the border in crimes committed at the border and securing the border to protect the country from crimes committed at the border this is an obsession turned into a dark real cooool punishment for people that come to this country for a better life before I get to sessions I just want to say that it struck me today as President Trump was giving his interview and answering no it was during his tweet he tweeted that he thought I've got that pretrial detention it was too harsh for Paul Manafort so it's too harsh for Paul Manafort but not for the thousands of asylum seekers that have come to our border okay that's one but they've also succeeded I mean this conversation has swung so far to the right like in 2015 you had congressional Democrats hitting President Obama about family detention facilities and now all of a sudden family detention facilities seem like a a great option in comparison to having children in tents what they did the morality here is the should say immoralities consistent because we're talking about in one week the president United States saying that John on was had to be a tough guy they're talking about people mr. president he killed people he didn't concentrate you gotta be tough and you got to be tough with children I mean look at the thread now in one week that we've heard from this administration it's frightening hey
