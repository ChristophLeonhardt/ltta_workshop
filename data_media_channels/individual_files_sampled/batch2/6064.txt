FBI agent Peter struck really proved himself to be very strong during his hearings with the GOP with members of Congress he was asked all sorts of ridiculous inappropriate questions but he managed to in my opinion fight back aggressively and effectively so I want to show you a few examples of that let's take a look at the first example where he defends his text messages in terms of the text that we will stop it you need to understand that that was written late at night off-the-cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero and my presumption based on that horrible disgusting behavior that the American population would not elect somebody demonstrating that behavior to be present in the United States it was in no way unequivocally any suggestion that me the FBI would take any action whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate as to the hundred million to one that was clearly a statement made in jest and using hyperbole I of course recognized that millions of Americans were likely to vote for candidate Trump I acknowledge that is absolutely their right that is what makes our democracy such a vibrant process that it is but to suggest somehow that we can parse down the words of shorthand textual conversations like there's some contract for a car is is simply not consistent with Meyer most people's use of text messaging that's an excellent explanation that and I like his tone and he's like well if you were unclear that I didn't like Donald Trump let me be clear I didn't like Donald Trump I thought his actions were disgusting right and he and we'll stop it meant the American people will vote against it he was wrong about that they did vote in favor of it well certainly in enough states for the Electoral College to have Donald Trump win but the like you Anna the thing that I like most of the strengths he reminded me a little bit of George Galloway there George Galloway during the Iraq war was called in the hearings he's British or he's actually Scottish and and brought in and they're like you know you're doing saying things that we think are in favor of saddam hussein and you know total BS he came in and he said i do not come as the accused i come as the accuser okay and he let it rip and i was like i like this guy okay that's that's the kind of scottish guy i like okay there's a reason why I like Scots anyway the other thing it reminded me of is finally somebody fighting back as a that's been called into these hearings you know usually they almost everybody lets these Republican Congressmen bully them and this kind of felt like a moment where somebody in the McCarthy hearings finally said to Joe McCarthy at long last do you have no decency sir okay and it started to turn around and I don't know why everybody bounce their heads to these congressmen they have no actual power because there's just a bunch of you know clowns putting together a three-ring circus well they do have power but unfortunately they wield their power in in support of what their donors want and and this is just their effort at appearing strong and appearing as though they are representing their constituents but if you look at their policies and if you look at what they've actually done for their constituents it's been nothing but incredibly regressive policies that hurt them economically that hurt them financially that hurt them in many different ways so this is their way of overcompensating and making it appear as though they're doing something again this is more nothing more than political theater and what I like is yes struck is fighting back and the reason why other people haven't fought back in a similar fashion is because I think people have been late to catch on to the fact that politics has fundamentally changed the these members of Congress are not these respectable you know buttoned up professional people anymore there's just not a and Trump running the type of campaign that he did and Trump conducting himself the way he does publicly on a daily base this has led to the circus that we see in Congress now in our judicial system it's all over the place in the way that we interact with one another the type of rhetoric we use and I like the fact that struck finally realized these are not people who are interested in having a legitimate discussion or ask me and they have no interest and asking me legitimate questions they just want to attack me and they have no interest in what I have to say well let me give it to them and I like that even though I'm sure we don't agree politically I'm glad that he struck back yeah I'm here all week two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos
