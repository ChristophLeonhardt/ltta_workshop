I'D LIKE TO BEGIN TODAY'S REMARKS BY BEGINNING AN UPDATE ON THE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES MAILED TO HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THE SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS MY HIGHEST AND AUTHORITY PRIORITY. ITCH JUST CONCLUDED A BRIEFING WITH THE FBI, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND SECRET SERVICE. AS WE SPEAK THE PACKAGES ARE BEING INSPECTED AND A MAJOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY. THE FULL WEIGH OF OUR GOVERNMENT IS BEING CONDUCTED TO BRING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DESPICABLE ACTS TO JUSTICE. WE WILL SPARE NO EXPENSES. I WANT TO SAY AT THESE TIMES WE HAVE TO UNIFY AND SEND ONE VERY CLEAR AND STRONG MESSAGE THAT ACTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND HAVE NO PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT'S A VERY BIPARTISAN STATEMENT. WE BOTH AGREE ON THAT. THIS EGREGIOUS CONDUCT IS ABHORRENT TO EVERYTHING WE HOLD DEAR AND SECRET AS AMERICANS. MY ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE UPDATES AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING.
