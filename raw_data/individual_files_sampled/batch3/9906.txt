REPEAL. DANA? Dana: PETER, THANK YOU. LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, REPUBLICANS ARE HIGHLIGHTING THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING A NEW TRADE DEAL WITH CANADA AND MEXICO AS THE GOVERNMENT AVERTS A SHUTDOWN AND THE ECONOMY KEEPS GETTING HIGH MARKS. REPUBLICANS STILL APPEAR POISED TO LOSE THE HOUSE NEXT MONTH. I'M JOINED BY STEVE SCALISE. I KNOW ON ANY OF THESE OCCASIONS, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A BRIGHT SIDE. THERE'S A LOT OF THEM. THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE FULFILLED A LOT OF THEIR CAMPAIGN PROMISES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GIVEN YOU ALL THE LEEWAY TO DO WHAT YOU FEEL NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THE COUNTRY. SOME THINGS GET CAUGHT UP IN THE SENATE. NOW YOU HAVE THIS CAVANAUGH NOMINATION. I WONDER IF YOU THINK THAT WILL BE A GOOD THING AND A HELP TO HOUSE REPUBLICANS OR FIT COULD TURN ENTHAOU KWRAFTIC TURNOUT FOR DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER SIDE. WELSH DANA, I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE CAN BE DOING TO FIGHT TO KEEP THE MAJORITY IS TO REMIND PEOPLE HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING AND WHY. OBVIOUSLY, THE TAX CUTS HAVE GOTTEN THE ECONOMY GOING, TO A POINT WHERE WE'VE SEEN RECORD GROWTH IN OUR JOBS. YOU'RE SEEING LOW UNEMPLOYMENT IN EVERY SPECTRUM, BY THE WAY. IT'S LITERALLY EVERY SPECTRUM OF OUR ECONOMY IS DOING BETTER. Dana: OPTIMISM BEING WAY UP THERE. YET THERE STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE IS THE NRCC PULLING BACK SOME MONEY. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S NORMAL. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RACES. YOU DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES. LOOK AT THIS NUMBER FROM ACT BLUE TWEETING SUNDAY, THIS IS THE FUND-RAISER FOR DEMOCRATS. BY YESTERDAY'S MIDNIGHT DEADLINE SMALL DOLLAR DONORS HAD MADE 300,000 INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS ADDING UP TO OVER $16.8 MILLION FOR CAMPAIGNS AND ORGANIZATIONS USING ACT BLUE, MAKING IT THE BIGGEST DAY EVER ON OUR PLATFORM. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO THIS LAST MONTH SO THAT YOU CAN SPEND IT WHERE YOU NEED TO? MONEY MATTERS A LOT. YOU CAN SEE THE LEFT IS INCREDIBLY ENERGIZED IN RAISING RECORD AMOUNTS OF MONEY. THEY GOT PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL BLOOMBERG PUTTING INDIVIDUALLY $80 MILLION OF HIS MONEY TO FLIP THE HOUSE FROM REPUBLICAN TO DEMOCRAT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE JUST WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING. THEY WANT TO REVERSE THE TAX CUTS. THEY WANT TO ABOLISH ICE. YOU'RE SEEING LITERALLY IN THESE DEMOCRATS PRIMARIES LIBERALS BEING BEATEN BY SOCIALISTS. THEIR PARTY MOVEMENT SO FAR TO THE LEFT WAY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO GROW AN ECONOMY. WE NEED TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT. WE DON'T NEED TO SPEND DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WITH THEM. WE'VE SEEN THAT IN OTHER RACES LIKE KAREN HANDLE'S RACE LAST YEAR. MOST EXPENSIVE RACE IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. WE WERE HEAVILY OUTSPENT YET STILL WON BECAUSE WE GOT A BETTER MESSAGE. THEY REALLY HAVE NO AGENDA EXCEPT TO RESIST TRUMP, RESIST ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. THEY ARE AGAINST THE TAX CUTS THAT ARE GROWING OUR ECONOMY AND REBILLING OUR MIDDLE CLASS. Dana: PRESIDENT TRUMP THIS MORNING AT THE ROSE GARDEN ACTUALLY EVEN WENT INTO THE AFTERNOON GIVING A STATEMENT ABOUT THE NEW TRADE DEAL THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GET SIGNED WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID. WE HAVE NEGOTIATED THIS NEW AGREEMENT BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS AND RECIPROCITY. WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WE ARE CLOSING ALL OF THESE TERRIBLE LOOPHOLES. I DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR COMPANIES LEAVE AND FIRE OUR WORKERS. OUR WORKERS NEVER GET JOBS TO REPLACE THOSE JOBS. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. Dana: CONGRESSMAN SCALISE, IF REPUBLICANS DON'T KEEP THE HOUSE, HOW DIFFICULT MIGHT IT BE TO GET THE NEW TRADE DEAL PASSED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP? I DON'T THINK NANCY PELOSI WANTS TO SEE THIS ECONOMY GROWING LIKE IT IS. SHE'S AGAINST THE TAX CUTS THAT ARE MAKING IT GROW. BUT IF YOU LOOK, THIS IS A GREAT DEAL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP NEGOTIATED. IT'S THE FIRST TO RENEGOTIATE WITH MEXICO. THEN CANADA. HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD YOU HAVE THOUGHT IF YOU HEARD THE RHETORIC OVER THE PAST YEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A BETTER DEAL WITH CANADA AND MEXICO? THIS IS GOOD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. YOU KNOW IN WISCONSIN, THE DAIRY PROBLEMS THEY WERE HAVING. THIS OPENS UP A LOT OF MARKETS. SO I APPLAUD PRESIDENT TRUMP ON DOING THE THINGS HE PROMISED. WE'RE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, TOO, BY THE WAY. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF US KEEPING THE HOUSE. Dana: DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO RUN ON THOSE POSITIVE THINGS OR DO YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SCARE YOUR BASE AND SAY, IF YOU DON'T TURN OUT, ALL OF THESE THINGS COULD GO AWAY? WELL, CLEARLY, YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW THE CONTRAST. PEOPLE SEE THAT. THEY'RE SEEING MORE MONEY IN THEIR PAY CHECKS. NOW THEY KNOW WHY. ANYWA THEY KNOW NANCY PELOSI THOUGHT IT WAS CRUMBS. THEY'RE ENJOYING THE BONUSES THEY HAVE GOTTEN. THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE. THEY'RE FOR SINGLE PAYOR HEALTH CARE WHICH MEANS MEDICARE IS GOING BANKRUPT IN EIGHT YEARS IF WE DON'T SAVE IT. THEY WANT TO DUMP 200 MILLION MORE PEOPLE ON MEDICARE AND MAKE IT GO BANK RUPT QUICKER. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING GOOD FOR SENIORS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. THE DEMOCRATS PLAN GETS RID OF THE PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT. WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT IT, THEY DON'T LIKE IT. Dana: MEDICARE WILL BE AN ISSUE EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TACKLE, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE.
