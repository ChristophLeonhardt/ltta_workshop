JILLIAN: A FOX NEWS ALERT, THREE
AMERICANS JUST FREED FROM NORTH
KOREA ARRIVING AT WALTER REED
MEDICAL CENTER, LANDED ON
AMERICAN SOIL FOR THE FIRST
TIME.
>> DETAINEES GREETED WARMLY BY
DONALD TRUMP, AND THE FIRST
LADY.
THE UNAUTHORIZED AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF KIM JONG-IL, MICHAEL MALICE,
HERE TODAY, THE FATHER OF KIM
JONG UN, THE FORMER LEADER OF
NORTH KOREA, A BIG MOMENT.
HOW BIG A SUCCESS STORY IS THIS?
>> SOME PEOPLE REMEMBER 1980,
RONALD REAGAN WAS SWORN IN AND
HOSTAGES WERE FREED.
THE FACT THE LAST TIME -- THIS
IS A BIG WIN FOR US.
DONALD TRUMP DID NOT GIVE ANY
CONCESSIONS.
AND KIM JONG UN SULTAN EASILY.
>> HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?
>> NORTH KOREA HAD A REPORTER,
PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD THE FAMOUS
PHOTO, LOOKING LIKE A HOSTAGE
HIMSELF.
HIMSELF.
HAD TO BE OBSEQUIOUS.
AND IF KIM JONG-IL AND IS
WILLING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND
MEET DONALD TRUMP ON NEUTRAL
SOIL IS A CHANGE.
ROB: THERE ARE BRAGGING RIGHTS
FOR KIM JONG UN.
HAVING THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES CONSIDERING YOU, A
SMALL LITTLE HERMIT KINGDOM.
>> IT IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR
THEM.
THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH IS GREAT,
THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP
DIDN'T HAVE A MEETING, THAT IS
HOW THEY OPERATE.
ALSO TO CONCESSIONS WITHOUT THE
MEETINGS HAVING BEEN HELD.
DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS, AND THE
JAPANESE RUN UP THE ISSUE.
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF HAVING THE
NEGOTIATION.
THIS IS A BIG STEP AND WE HAVE
THREE HOSTAGES, 25 MILLION MORE
HOSTAGES TO GO.
>> IT IS FAIR TO CELEBRATE AND
BE THRILLED AND HAPPY FOR WHAT
PLAYS OUT IN THE WE HOURS OF THE
MORNING.
HOW DO WE FEEL AND LOOK FORWARD
FROM HERE?
SKEPTICAL, OPTIMISTIC?
>> WE LOOK AT THEIR ACTIONS AND
THESE ARE CONCRETE DEMONSTRABLE
MOVES THE THINGS THAT WE WANT,
THAT THEY SHOULD WANT AS WELL TO
BE A COUNTRY IN THE 21ST CENTURY
AND NOT THE 19TH.
ROB: LOOKING AT THIS SITUATION
IN EARLY JUNE WHEN THEY MEET
SUPPOSEDLY IN SINGAPORE I DON'T
SEE HOW THIS DOESN'T TURN INTO A
STALEMATE BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE
GUYS NEED TO WIN IN ANY
NEGOTIATION WAS BOTH SIDES CAN'T
WIN.
WHO IS THE ONE WHO GIVES ON
THIS?
IT WON'T BE THE PRES. NO WAY HE
WILL LET THIS BE A LOSING
SITUATION FOR THE UNITED STATES.
>> DON'T THINK THAT IS TO SOME
EXTENT, THAT WOULD BE A GOOD
DEAL.
>> WOULD THEY DO THAT?
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT FROM THEM.
>> THE FACT THEY ARE WILLING TO
TALK ABOUT THAT, ON SOCIAL MEDIA
AND IN COURSE TERMS, IT IS
INTENSE AND KIND OF LIKE THE
BIBLE, AFTER REFERRING TO THAT,
