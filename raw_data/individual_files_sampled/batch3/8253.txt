SPEAKING OF WHICH, THE DEATH OF COMEDY AND DECENCY. THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S "ANGLE." AT THE START OF HER MONOLOGUE AS A HEADLINER OF THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION DINNER, MICHELLE WOLF, A COMEDIAN, NEITHER MYSELF OR ANYBODY ON MY STAFF AT EVER HEARD OF, MADE PLAIN THE DIRECTION SHE WAS HEADED IN. GOOD EVENING. HERE WE ARE, THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER. LIKE A PORN STAR SAYS WHEN SHE'S ABOUT TO HAVE WITH A TRUMP, "LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH." THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE GETTING TONIGHT. Laura: AT LEAST SHE HAD A REALLY GOOD VOICE. WELL, THEY GOT MUCH MORE OF IT. THE PRESIDENT WASN'T IN ATTENDANCE. PRESS SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, KELLYANNE CONWAY, AND OTHERS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WERE AT THE DINNER. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EVENING TO CELEBRATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. BUT OF ALL THE COMEDIANS THE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION GOT FIRED, THEY TURNED TO THE OBSCURE MICHELLE WOLF. TRUMP THINKS YARD SALES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. AFTER TRUMP GOT ELECTED, WOMEN STARTED KNITTING THOSE HATS. WHEN I FIRST SAW THEM, I WAS LIKE, . I GUESS MINE JUST HAS LOT MORE YARN ON EDGE. YEAH. IT SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE RESEARCH BEFORE YOU GOT ME TO DO THIS. Laura: THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THE CHOICE OF AN ASPIRATIONAL COMEDIAN LIKE WOLF, WITH ONE HBO SPECIAL, I GUESS, A FEW WRITING GIGS TO HER CREDIT, TELLS US A LOT ABOUT THE CORRESPONDENCE ASSOCIATION. TO SOME OF THOSE WHO COVER THE WHITE HOUSE, LET'S FACE IT, WE KNOW IT, ARE BRIMMING WITH HATRE KNOW IT, ARE BRIMMING WITH HATRD OF THIS PRESIDENT AND ALL THAT HE REPRESENTS. LET'S FACE IT, HE EMBARRASSED THEM WITH HIS ELECTORAL VICTORY AND HE CONTINUES TO PROVE THEM WRONG DAY AFTER DAY. AND HE ENDS UP REVEALING THEM FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE. I HAVE TO SAY, GUYS, WHEN YOU SEE THE FACES OF THE CROWD AT THE CORRESPONDENCE DINNER, WHEN THEY WERE CUTTING AWAY FROM THE C-SPAN COVERAGE, IT WAS I WAS THINKING, WAIT A SECOND, CAN WE JUST HAVE A FULL SCREEN AND READS AT THERE? BECAUSE WE NEED TO SEE THE EXACT WE NEED TO SEE THE EXACT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ON THE REPORTERS WHO ARE LAUGHING AT THE PARTICULAR TIMES WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO HIGHLIGHT. WHEN YOU COMPARE WHAT SHE WAS SAYING TO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING IN MICHIGAN, WOW. BY THE WAY, IS THIS BETTER THAN THAT PHONY WASHINGTON WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER? IS THIS MORE FUN? I COULD BE UP THERE TONIGHT SMILING LIKE I LOVE WHEN THEY ARE HITTING YOU, SHOT AFTER SHOT, THESE PEOPLE, THEY HATE YOUR GUTS. Laura: WELL, FOR THIS AND OTHER STATEMENTS LIKE IT, THE PRESS WILL FOREVER DESPISE TRUMP. UNLIKE OTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS WHO RAN TO THE NEAREST CORNER AND DID NOT APOLOGIZE WITH THE MEDIA ATTACKS, TRUMP RETURNED FIRE. BY CHOOSING WOLF AS THEIR AVATAR, THE D.C. MEDIA ELITE HAVE CONFIRMED THEIR BIAS FOR ANYONE WHO WILL GIVE THEM EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. BOY, WAS I GLAD MY KIDS AND I WEREN'T WATCHING. I KNOW PEOPLE REALLY WANT ME TO GO AFTER TRUMP TONIGHT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT CREDIT WHEN HE DESERVES IT. LIKE, HE PULLED OUT OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT. AND I THINK HE SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR THAT BECAUSE HE SAID HE WAS
