1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,951
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

2
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:04,520
>> Reporter: LET ME FOLLOW UP

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,754
ON JIM'S QUESTION.

4
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:06,989
MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME FOLLOW UP

5
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:07,956
ON JIM'S QUESTION THAT I DON'T

6
00:00:07,956 --> 00:00:09,124
THINK WE GOT AN ANSWER TO

7
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:11,727
>> President Trump: WHICH

8
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:12,094
QUESTION?

9
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:12,695
>> Reporter: HOW OF YOUR

10
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:15,130
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS, BEING

11
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:15,564
ACCUSED --

12
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,433
>> President Trump: I'VE BEEN

13
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:17,766
ACCUSED.

14
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:18,567
FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

15
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:19,101
EXCUSE ME.

16
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:20,436
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED, AND I WAS

17
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:22,871
ACCUSED BY I BELIEVE IT WAS FOUR

18
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,172
WOMEN.

19
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:26,175
YOU CAN CHECK WITH SEAN HANNITY.

20
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,976
YOU CAN CHECK WITH FOX BECAUSE

21
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:30,145
THEY COVERED IT VERY STRONGLY.

22
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:30,946
WHO GOT PAID?

23
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,113
EXCUSE ME.

24
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:33,549
WHO GOT PAID?

25
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,184
I WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE

26
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:36,351
WOMEN WHO GOT PAID A LOT OF

27
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,953
MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT

28
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:38,220
ME.

29
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,621
WE CAUGHT THEM, AND THE

30
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,524
MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSED TO PUT

31
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:43,525
IT ON TELEVISION.

32
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:44,960
THEY REFUSED TO EVEN WRITE ABOUT

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,527
IT.

34
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,563
THERE WERE FOUR WOMEN, AND MAYBE

35
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:48,764
MORE.

36
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:50,632
I THINK THE NUMBER IS FOUR OR

37
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:50,966
FIVE.

38
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,369
ONE HAD A MORTGAGE PAID OFF HER

39
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,772
HOUSE, $52,000.

40
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:58,073
ANOTHER ONE HAD OTHER THINGS

41
00:00:58,073 --> 00:00:58,540
HAPPEN.

42
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,442
THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT I

43
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:02,344
BELIEVE WAS OFFERED $750,000 TO

44
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:04,980
SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT ME, AND SHE

45
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,515
IS THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT.

46
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:07,716
THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE.

47
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:10,552
SHE REPORTED IT INSTEAD OF THE

48
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:10,886
MONEY.

49
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:14,656
SO I'VE HAD NUMEROUS ACCUSATIONS

50
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,926
ABOUT ME.

51
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:20,028
THEY MADE FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT

52
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:20,529
ME.

53
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:21,597
KNOWING THEY WERE FALSE.

54
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:23,532
I NEVER MET THEM.

55
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:25,534
I NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE.

56
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:26,535
WHAT DO THEY DO?

57
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:28,470
THEY TOOK MONEY IN ORDER TO SAY

58
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,538
BAD THINGS.

59
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,373
I HAVE HAD STORIES WRITTEN IN

60
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:33,342
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," FRONT

61
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:36,578
PAGE, ABOUT FOUR WOMEN, THE

62
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:39,148
WHOLE TOP CENTER FRONT PAGE OF

63
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:40,716
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

64
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:41,517
FOUR BIG PICTURES.

65
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,352
WOW, THAT'S A BIG THING.

66
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:43,952
WHAT'S THAT?

67
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:45,053
THESE WERE WOMEN THAT WERE

68
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:47,156
QUOTED SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT

69
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:49,224
ME, NOT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT

70
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:50,726
ME BUT BAD THINGS.

71
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,027
I SAID GEE, THAT'S TOO BAD.

72
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:54,329
I KNEW THEM A LONG TIME AGO.

73
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,764
15 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO.

74
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:57,566
I SAID THAT'S TOO BAD.

75
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,167
I'M SURPRISED.

76
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,169
THEN I SEE THEM ON TELEVISION,

77
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,203
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

78
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:04,273
THE NEXT DAY OR A DAY LATER,

79
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:06,742
THEY WERE INCENSED.

80
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:08,143
THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP IS A NICE

81
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:08,943
GUY.

82
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:09,877
WE NEVER SAID THIS.

83
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,914
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" DEVOTES

84
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:12,748
REPORTING.

85
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:13,415
THEY ARE FAKE NEWS.

86
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:17,319
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

87
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,654
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" WOULD NOT

88
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:20,923
REPORT THAT THIS STORY WAS FAKE.

89
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:22,157
THESE WOMEN SAID GREAT THINGS.

90
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:23,759
NOT ONLY DID THEY NOT SAY THE

91
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,127
BAD STUFF.

92
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:28,130
THEY SAID GREAT THINGS ABOUT ME.

93
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,731
FRONT PAGE.

94
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:31,333
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE WOMEN.

95
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,568
THEY WENT ON TELEVISION AND THEY

96
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:35,070
DIDN'T WANT TO WHEN I DIDN'T ASK

97
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,305
THEM AND THEY SAID

98
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:39,107
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" MADE IT UP.

99
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:40,709
THEY GAVE FALSE QUOTES.

100
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,945
AND THEY WENT ON A LOT OF SHOWS.

101
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:43,979
THEY WERE REALLY INCENSED AND

102
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,547
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

103
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,149
THAT'S WHY, PEOPLE KNOW THAT A

104
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,718
LOT OF THE NEWS IS FAKE AND A

105
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,553
LOT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE

106
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:52,554
ARE FAKE.

107
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:54,923
BUT 20% OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL,

108
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:55,557
OKAY?

109
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:58,160
>> Reporter: IF I COULD

110
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,294
ACTUALLY ASK MY QUESTION.

111
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:01,363
YOU DIDN'T LET ME ASK MY

112
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:01,930
QUESTION.

113
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,598
>> President Trump: YOU'VE

114
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:03,932
BEEN ASKING A QUESTION FOR

115
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:04,933
10 MINUTES.

116
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:05,500
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

117
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,902
>> Reporter: HOW DOES IT

118
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,170
IMPACT YOUR OPINION ON THE

119
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,937
ALLEGATIONS?

120
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,539
>> President Trump: I'VE HAD A

121
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,540
LOT OF FULL CHARGES MADE AGAINST

122
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:11,840
ME.

123
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,343
I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON

124
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,544
UNFORTUNATELY.

125
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:16,578
I'VE BEEN A FAMOUS PERSON FOR A

126
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:19,014
LONG TIME BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF

127
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:20,749
FALSE CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME,

128
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:21,717
REALLY FALSE.

129
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:23,452
I KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD

130
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:24,519
FULL CHARGES.

131
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:25,754
PEOPLE WANT FAME.

132
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:26,955
THEY WANT MONEY.

133
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:27,990
THEY WANT WHATEVER.

134
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,392
SO WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT

135
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:31,560
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY

136
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,594
SITTING HOME WATCHING TELEVISION

137
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,997
WHERE THEY SAY OH, JUDGE

138
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:36,164
KAVANAUGH, THIS OR THAT.

139
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:37,900
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES.

140
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,369
I'VE HAD MANY FALSE CHARGES.

141
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:42,371
I HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN

142
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,472
AIRPLANE AND I ATTACKED HER

143
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,740
WHILE PEOPLE WERE COMING ON THE

144
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,341
PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER ONE

145
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,142
BEST SELLER OUT.

146
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:49,177
I MEAN, IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY

147
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:49,978
STORY.

148
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,113
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM.

149
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:51,947
SO WHEN YOU SAY DOES IT AFFECT

150
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:56,118
ME IN TERMS OF MY THINKING, WITH

151
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,986
RESPECT TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH,

152
00:03:57,986 --> 00:03:59,388
ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT

153
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:00,122
MANY TIMES.

154
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:03,125
AND IF THE NEWS WOULD HAVE

155
00:04:03,125 --> 00:00:00,000
REPORTED THESE FOUR PEOPLE, I
