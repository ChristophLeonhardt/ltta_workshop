1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
so today I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the movie saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,890
and so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just talked about it</font>

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,860
like I do every year I'd have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,760
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> indifferent factor let's say</font>

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,859
weird I get so paranoid at the moment

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:30,960
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing these films not the</font>

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,210
prettiest thing ever I wore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to see</font>

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,760
saw five this evening the past couple of

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
years I've started doing reuse of the

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,239
saw movies on YouTube and so I thought I

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,789
would continue it with reviewing saw

12
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,760
five but something I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,260
important to do before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,780
sulfide is to put all the movies in

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,120
perspective of one another because I

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,890
mean you get reviewers online who always

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,960
criticize it on the basis it's a horror

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,239
movie that's grotesque and they hate the

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,430
first one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they see a second one</font>

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,170
so they can I hate it even more but it

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,939
keeps on coming it keeps on succeeding

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,729
at doing what it's there to do and so

23
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,260
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more and more angry and of</font>

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,970
course the ratings therefore go down

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,439
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these professional critics</font>

26
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I am a sore fan I'm not going to</font>

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,950
deny that but at the end of the day if

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,810
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see saw five I assume</font>

29
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are a fan or you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,070
stupid and I've just sort of hated all

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,259
the movie so far but decide to keep on

32
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,970
watching them furthermore if you haven't

33
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,400
seen any of the saw movies so far and

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,170
someone is dragging you along to see it

35
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't because it links up all the</font>

36
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,430
different movies together so far of the

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,159
jigsaw legacy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">pull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the saw movies in perspective but</font>

39
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,759
when I'm giving these marks out of 10

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,399
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the basis of how they relate</font>

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,619
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the movies in the world but in</font>

42
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,390
relation to each other within the saw

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,880
franchise so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with saw one I</font>

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave it nine out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 now the story is</font>

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,799
arguably original nothing is truly

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,079
original in life but it had this great

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,450
build up throughout to a climax which

48
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,000
can only be described as spine-tingling

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,580
when

50
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,199
it happens and when the music kicks in

51
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,850
I'd be pretty surprised to hear that

52
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,010
someone wasn't surprised by the outcome

53
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,110
and what is the main kaun of the first

54
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,850
movie it probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the fact</font>

55
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,460
that the acting was bad in areas saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

56
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you I give it seven out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten the pro i</font>

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,750
think is the fact that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps out of</font>

58
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,660
the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw world and sort of</font>

59
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,790
expands<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all in a really interesting</font>

60
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,180
way and it also humanizes this jigsaw

61
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,820
character a negative i'd say is the fact

62
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,740
that certain aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> the film would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

63
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,630
considered unprovable and unrealistic

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,200
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it is a horror movie the events</font>

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,140
that happen on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic but there</font>

66
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,360
are certain aspects of the build-up of

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,150
the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you think mmm they could</font>

68
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have dealt with that a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better so 3 I</font>

69
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,370
give this one six out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 my least</font>

70
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,980
favorite of the saw movies well starting

71
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,510
off of a pro again so it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

72
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad it is a story which reveals a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

73
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,690
interesting layer to the jigsaw legacy

74
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,650
it is definitely a bridge between you

75
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,739
know that the past and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future of the</font>

76
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,810
saw franchise I think the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason I</font>

77
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,640
didn't enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> this movie was due to the</font>

78
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,769
negative of the fact that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

79
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,920
acting in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me with</font>

80
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,230
exceptions for shawnee smith and tobin

81
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,019
bell who plays jigsaw great performances

82
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,450
as always but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was just something</font>

83
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,320
about the way the pace of the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> film</font>

84
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,510
and just the way it was it just really

85
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,060
bugged me it just sits or seem sloppy so

86
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,459
for I gave this a hour 10 and I'd have

87
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,470
to say this is probably my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

88
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the law with exception to the first one</font>

89
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,360
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an original and can't be</font>

90
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,190
touched in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense the main positive</font>

91
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,930
of this movie and the reason I liked it

92
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,450
so much was as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a physical aspect</font>

93
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,230
of grotesque murder they also had a very

94
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,970
emotive element to it dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with very</font>

95
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,130
sensitive issues and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why</font>

96
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,190
the first one got to me so much was

97
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,860
there are these moral dilemmas which I

98
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel that saw two and sort of three sort</font>

99
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,799
of brought down a bit and really went on

100
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,770
just for the gore but so for although<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

101
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">did have a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font>

102
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,350
or it really did have some hard-hitting

103
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,720
moral dilemmas and sensitive issues

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,930
which i think are striking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the viewer</font>

105
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the negative however would have to be</font>

106
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,729
the ending although it was a satisfying

107
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,889
ending it just felt a bit much of the

108
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,199
same you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the third you know</font>

109
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first saw had such a hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hitting</font>

110
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,370
ending I guess we want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

111
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that again and we feel that you know the</font>

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Krays are saying well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as we have</font>

113
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,220
the music him and have sort of the

114
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,080
trademark then that would do so this

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,880
brings us to saw five now when I

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,360
normally see a saw movie I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have</font>

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,620
to give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time before I can give</font>

118
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,449
it a real good analysis but obviously

119
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,370
made news video straight after so I have

120
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,680
disagreed with my previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos but</font>

121
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this i feel that straight away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,930
can get a good sense of what I made of

123
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,090
it it was a new director and I feel the

124
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,520
director did a great job and the general

125
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,919
pacing was very well done the directing

126
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,960
had this very new rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel to it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

127
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,090
I really liked but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this movie felt like</font>

128
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,550
saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> three which was a bridge more of a</font>

129
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,620
setup for what is to come but without

130
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,930
spoiling what that is there specifically

131
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,729
I think it'd be fair to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that the</font>

132
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:26,099
main trap of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the five people it just</font>

133
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,250
seems so disconnected and not completely

134
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,410
irrelevant but just it didn't really

135
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the significance to the main story</font>

136
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,500
and therefore I was kind of disappointed

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,020
with that the girl was of course very

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,870
nice i think the traps one as innovative

139
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,900
as they make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to be whenever I</font>

140
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,010
write movies I always write it based on

141
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,900
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch it again and some of</font>

142
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,310
you may disagree that's a bad way of

143
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,560
doing it but I feel for movies good you

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,199
know I will watch it again i will take

145
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,750
things differently each time well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

146
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">watched saw five again i think i will</font>

147
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">but not as much as the others probably a</font>

148
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,030
bit more than three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore i gave</font>

149
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,310
this a rating of six out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 it's a</font>

150
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,830
good movie it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good step up on the</font>

151
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,990
jigsaw legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that a lot of</font>

152
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,699
reviewers look at it as a film on its

own and go

154
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,210
oh it's you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you've seen</font>

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,210
and therefore it's not all independent

157
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,430
and therefore they scrutinize it this is

158
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,980
for sore fans if you're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> to saw five</font>

159
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,660
now you are a sore fan because you

160
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,310
wouldn't be watching otherwise unless

161
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,930
there is something wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you I</font>

162
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,030
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest tragedy of this movie</font>

163
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,310
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there wasn't</font>

164
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,380
that much hype leading up to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

165
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,570
they thought that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> height machine was</font>

166
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fan base itself the strange thing I</font>

167
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,030
found leaning up this movie was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

168
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,760
tagline which was you won't believe how

169
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,600
it ends and this is the sad thing out of

170
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,060
all the saw movies if I had to put this

171
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,420
tagline with any of them saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> five would</font>

172
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,430
have been my last choice because

173
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,530
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ending did have a little</font>

174
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,840
twist to it the gem will feel when the

175
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">build up to what the twist was about was</font>

176
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,600
no surprise to me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font>

177
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,130
they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pour site nicely if</font>

178
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,380
they had survived the way it was and

179
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,600
then they had an extra twist on the end

180
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,250
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they bring in the</font>

181
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,080
saw music the trademark and you know

182
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,060
that it's the end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had this sense</font>

183
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,130
of is the bit that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe that</font>

184
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,570
that isn't it and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

185
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,740
something else after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and it just ends</font>

186
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,090
on that saw three although I felt you

187
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,100
know wasn't that great<font color="#E5E5E5"> it revealed to us</font>

188
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,240
something new sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five has given us</font>

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,820
facts about you know previous movies and

190
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,120
stuff that's happened but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt it</font>

191
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,980
was very much more of the same it's like

192
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,230
well I know chicks'll this well and I

193
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,290
knew how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going to pan out and for</font>

194
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that reason you won't believe how it</font>

195
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,080
ends I guess I didn't because I thought

196
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was going to be better than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

197
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,950
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it six out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten I still</font>

198
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,150
recommend you go and see it especially

199
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,070
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> so fans if you've never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

200
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,340
store before watch it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start and</font>

201
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,520
catch up before Halloween next year when

202
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,580
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the final one I'd like to see the</font>

203
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,680
original directors and writers and get

204
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,720
involved with the sick one by hear that

205
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,060
the script<font color="#CCCCCC"> has already been done I just</font>

206
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,730
really hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that within this time they</font>

207
00:08:28,730 --> 00:00:00,000
really really go for it
