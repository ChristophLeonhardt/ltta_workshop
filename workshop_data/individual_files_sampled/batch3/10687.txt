being Native American has been part of my story I guess since the day I was born we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago she of the great tribal heritage what tribe is it let me think about that one they call her Pocahontas I've got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity hate for my trouble if you take the test if it shows you're an idiot Warren releasing results of a DNA test showing she has very distant Native American ancestry the report suggests Warren has just a trace of Native American heritage DNA test proved white woman white woman people questioning whether this revelation really did win her in any point do you think that the president is Elizabeth Warren a million dollars if I was Elizabeth Warren I would make sure that when I walk out pay me what you owe me the problem with the DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance you ought to be respected in terms of what it means for example to be a charity top can say whatever he wants about me but mocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get at me does know America stands for so regular everyday sane people the argument about well whose a percentage of this race in that race is not truly important people are just worried about how am I gonna get to work every day you know my car is broken down I need to have a job to begin with you know I want to be able to have a secure life for myself and when I have food to eat nice place to stay they're worried about basic tangible things that people have to have every single day but to the fringe extremists that are out there the far left is too far right is it maybe and to the media it is very important because that's all they have you
