1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,390
It's time to call out Wikileaks
for what it really is:

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,120
a non-state hostile intelligence
service often abetted

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,560
by state actors like Russia.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:17,520


6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,950
But I kind of think
of Iranian compliance

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,150
with the nuclear deal
like a bad tenant.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,180
Have any of you ever
had a bad tenant?

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,680
You know, they don't
pay their rent.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,220
You call them, and
then they send a check.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,094
And it doesn't clear.

12
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,980
And they send another one.

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,070
And then the next day,
there's an old, tired sofa

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,820
in the front yard.

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,620
You tell them to take it away.

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,510
And they drag it to the back.

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,600
This is Iranian
compliance today.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,920


19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,147
So the great public debate is
about whether he is rational

20
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:47,730
or not, right?

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,514
We use this word from
Western philosophy

22
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,180
to try and describe
someone who wouldn't

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,263
know Western philosophy
if it hit him in the head.

24
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:58,080


25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,860
I'm with the president
nearly every day.

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,790
We have 35 or 40
minutes on his schedule.

27
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,750
It almost always runs
long, which is great.

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,416
Great questions.

29
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:21,260


30
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,110
The Russians clearly did
it in the 2016 election.

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,110
They did it in the 2012
election, in the 1970s as well.

32
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,070


33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,200
There were those that seem
aghast and shocked that

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,300
the Russians were trying
to impact and adversely --

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,720
place the outcome
that they preferred

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,040
on American democracy.

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,080
They've been at this
a hell of a long time.

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,830


39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,430
We have -- we do
have a special task,

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,210
because of the global
nature of what we do.

41
00:01:53,210 --> 00:00:00,000
