1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,030
I gained momentary notoriety in my high school
when junior year, I started drawing little

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,880
toast characters on the whiteboard in my physics
class.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,250
First extreme toast, and then ghost toast,
and then other people joined in adding more

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,480
and more ridiculous toast puns.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,350
Pope toast and toast busters and a toastage
stamp.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,750
And some other ones that now that its not
2008 and we all woke I realize are kinda offensive.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,660
But the teacher ran out of space on that board.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,180
And he put up another board.

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,789
Which we also covered in toast.

10
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,660
For a brief couple of weeks, I was the toast
girl.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,700
The one who started the toast.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,870
Where, usually doodles are confined to private
marginalia in notebooks we hope no one else

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,140
will read, my little toasts became a public
display of identity.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,649
What kind of person is the girl who started
the toast.

15
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,710
What does that tell people about me?

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,489
After my brush with greatness my doodles retreated
back into smaller, less visible spaces.

17
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,489
My copies of The Odyssey and Huckleberry fin
are dotted with lightning bolts and tiny cartoon

18
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,489
dinosaurs

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,850
Then I started drawing concentric circles
on the edges of my notebooks because of an

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,320
album cover that I liked when I was 14 and
I never quite stopped.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,829
But peak doodle were the notebooks I carried
through my last semester of college where

22
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:21,539
every page had an elaborate header in a hand
drawn font: Northanger Abbey or Brazilian

23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:26,080
Englishes, each day a new invented lettering
sprawling across the top, my concentric circle

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,509
pattern cascading down the margins.

25
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,289
The actual notes I took only filled a couple
of lines.

26
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:38,340
I was already 1000% done with school and filling
space was a way to fill time.

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,409
Unlike my toast, I didn’t want anyone to
see these doodles..

28
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,389
I didn’t want them to know I wasn’t paying
attention.

29
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:47,820
But drawing circles inside of circles was
a way to keep me still.

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,009
When I was weeks away from graduation, everything
splintering out in every direction, I’d

31
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,619
revert to that pattern as a way to stay calm.

32
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,179
A way to keep me with myself—to make being
there bearable.

33
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,179
Now?

34
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,179
I mostly doodle sharks.

35
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:08,869
I drew one on the cover of a document I wrote
to train people at my old job once.

36
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,449
Echoes of toast, you know?

37
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,530
Taylor, she will show up and work hard and
do a good job but you will not crush that

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,710
weirdo out of her.

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,710
You won’t.

40
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,540
I love wondering about the doodles I come
across on other people’s pages.

41
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,200
Whether they exist to announce themselves,
to tell me how to read the person who was

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,310
writing there.

43
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,080
Or, like my circles inside circles inside
circles they create a sort of space for their

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,470
doodler to bear being alone.

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,180
Please tell me in the comments, what do you
doodle and why?

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,750
