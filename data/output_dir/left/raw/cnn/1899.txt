1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
this afternoon President Trump tweeted
his condolences to the people of Spain

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,649
quote the United States condemns the
terror attack in Barcelona Spain and

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,759
will do whatever is necessary to help be
tough and strong we love you

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,170
and then the president tweeted this
study what General Pershing of the

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,640
United States did to terrorists Wincott
there was no more radical Islamic terror

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,930
for 35 years let's take a look to this
story that he is told about general

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,279
perching and how he handled terrorists
the president has discussed this claim

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,860
in much more detail before take a look
he caught 50 terrorists who did

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,780
tremendous damage and killed many people
and he took the 50 terrorists and he

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,289
took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in
pig's blood and he had his men load his

11
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:57,230
rifles and he lined up the 50 people and
they shot 49 of those people and the

12
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:04,650
50th person he said you go back to you
people and you tell them what happened

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:14,250
and for 25 years there wasn't a problem
so that story is not true there is no

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,290
evidence backing up president Trump's
claim that in the early 1900s general

15
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,100
john pershing tried to quell a muslim
uprising in the philippines by dipping

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,090
50 bullets in pig's blood which is of
course offensive to Muslims and shooting

17
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,549
49 Muslim insurgents and telling the
fifth to go tell everyone what he saw

18
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:38,159
historians say there's zero evidence to
that none not true there is evidence

19
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,180
that a different military leader in the
Philippines may have buried dead

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,979
insurgents with a dead pig but none that
Pershing did it or even approved of it

21
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,930
and most important there's no evidence
that burying dead insurgents with a pig

22
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,140
did anything to stop the violence so
just to be clear what happened today in

23
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,110
the face of a horrific terrorist attack
where people are still finding out that

24
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,860
loved ones have been killed or injured
President Trump just told the world too

25
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,470
a story that is not true a lie about an
American general dipping bullets in

26
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:26,460
pig's blood blood and killing insurgents
a story that by the way does nothing to

27
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,370
help keep our soldiers and the American
people traveling the world safer at

28
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,080
times of crisis the nation turns to its
president for reassurance and for truth

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,020
and for moral clarity and the lie about
General Pershing does not provide any of

30
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,630
those also one might observe the very
different reactions from this president

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,190
today's Islamic terrorist attack which
the president condemned immediately and

32
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,350
with this inflammatory untrue story and
how president trep responded to the

33
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,470
white supremacist terrorist attack on
Saturday which is an attack he has yet

34
00:03:04,470 --> 00:00:00,000
to unequivocally call terrorism at all
