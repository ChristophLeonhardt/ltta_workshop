yeah well the agent is Peter struck and he is the same guy by the way who sends two texts which is why his name he's the one who was removed from Mahler's investigation I want to see all the facts come out before leaping to a conclusion on that as rather it be very easy to - damn him because as your as you point out his finger is in every pie so to speak but you know the way the FBI works he's a high-ranking intelligence agents who was basically the case agent on the Hillary Clinton case and as a result you would expect that he would be at every single important development in that case and because he's a highly regarded agent he was recruited by Muller to be on that investigation as well and everyone who I talked to about him says he's an exceptional counterintelligence agent now my own view of the Hillary Clinton matter is that President Obama was never going to allow mrs. Clinton to be indicted and that the subordinates of the president acted in accordance with his direction including adopting his theory for why the case would not be brought if I'm right about that then it's not surprising to see every subordinate in involved in these different things that seem to put a thumb on the scale for for mrs. Clinton but of course you know the orders are coming from above it may well be that you know a stroke is a you know he has moral agency and he did what he did and maybe we'll find out that he's a zealot zealous partisan and that he couldn't be he couldn't be fair in the Clinton case when it came to you know objectively dealing the incriminating evidence and he couldn't be fair to Trump either but my sense is that that's not the case and one of the reasons I think that is struck on the Muller investigation is the one of the agent who and who interviewed general Flynn who just pled guilty last week to lying to the FBI the interesting thing about that is FBI director Comey told the house in some closed-door testimony that the agents who interviewed general Flynn believed he had been telling the truth and that apparently got countermanded later on by Muller's staff of very aggressive prosecutors it seems to me that if struck was the kind of guy who really had it in for Trump he would have taken exactly the opposite tack and maintained that that Flynn was lying but apparently that's not the case so I really think we ought to wait till til we see everything in black and white before we render a judgment on ya well Andrew McCarthy it's a pleasure to talk with you in such detail it's such a complicated matter and we've taken almost 20 minutes of your time and I feel like we've just scratched the surface but it is a this is a serious matter no doubt about it I've seen some White House lawyers suggest oh this is going to be over my American Thanksgiving all this will be over by Christmas this feels like it's a permanent trench warfare thing that I think is going to continue to the 2018 election or if it's a cut-off some other ways that how you feel - I do because I think the the 2018 if I'm right that Muller is thinking about I'm not saying that Muller wants to impeach Trump but that's what he's thinking about whether there's an impeachable case enough because I don't think it's sensible that a prosecutor would think he could indict the president in court that that I don't think could ever happen so if he's thinking about impeachment and if the 2018 elections are pivotable pivotal to whether impeachment is possible or not it makes only sense I think that this investigation is going at least through the 2018 elections and into probably 2019 yeah wouldn't surprise me if Muller made his announcement his report in the middle of the 2018 campaign but I'm a bit of a I'm a bit of a skeptic here Andrew McCarthy what a pleasure to have so much of your time that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always to interview today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
