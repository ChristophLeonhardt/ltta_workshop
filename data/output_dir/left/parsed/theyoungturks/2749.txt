THE SECRETARY OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF CONGRESS
AND BOY, SHE HAD SOME
INTERESTING AND AMUSING EXCUSES
FOR DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR.
HER
NAME IS KIRSTJEN NIELSEN AND SHE
WAS QUESTIONED BY A LOT OF THE
SENATORS, MANY OF WHOM WERE
FRUSTRATED.
LET'S START WITH
DICK DURBIN WHO WAS IN THE
INFAMOUS MEETING WERE DONALD
TRUMP MADE THE SHITHOLE
COMMENTS, AND DURBIN IS THE ONE
WHO CALLED HIM OUT ON IT IN THE
FIRST PLACE, WHERE THE PRESIDENT
CALLED HAITI, SOMEWHAT IN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND ALL OF
THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES SHITHOLES.
HERE IS THE EXCHANGE BACK AND
FORTH.
>>WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER THE
PRESIDENT SAYING ABOUT
IMMIGRATION FROM AFRICAN
COUNTRIES TO THE UNITED STATES?
>>WHAT I HEARD HIM SAYING WAS
THAT HE'D LIKE TO MOVE AWAY FROM
A COUNTRY-BASED QUOTA SYSTEM TO
A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM, IT
SHOULDN'T MATTER WHERE YOU'RE
FROM, IT SHOULD MATTER WHAT YOU
CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNITED
STATES.
>>HOW DID HE CHARACTERIZE THOSE
COUNTRIES IN AFRICA?
>>I DON'T SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER
A CATEGORIZATION OF COUNTRIES IN
AFRICA.
I THINK WHAT HE WAS
SAYING, AS BEST I COULD TELL AND
AS YOU KNOW THERE WERE ABOUT A
DOZEN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, THERE
WERE A LOT OF CROSS
CONVERSATIONS, THERE WAS A
LOT OF ROUGH TALK BY A LOT OF
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, BUT
WHAT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO BE
SAYING WAS LET'S MOVE AWAY
FROM THE COUNTRIES AND LET'S
LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND MAKE
SURE THAT THOSE WE BRING HERE
CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY.
>>WHAT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO BE
SAYING -- NOT WHAT HE SAID --
WHAT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO BE
SAYING IS LET'S LOOK AWAY FROM
THE COUNTRIES AND LOOK AT THE
INDIVIDUALS.
BUT HE DIDN'T
ACTUALLY SAY THAT AT ALL, IN
FACT HE SAID THE OPPOSITE.
HE
SAID WHY ARE WE LETTING THESE
COUNTRIES IN, WHICH HE DESCRIBED
AS SHITHOLE COUNTRIES, AND HE
SAID ABOUT THE HAITIANS TAKE
THEM OUT. AND HE SAID WHEN WE
LET IN PEOPLE FROM NORWAY?
THAT'S NOT PERSON BASED OR
MERIT-BASED, IT'S COUNTRY-BASED.
I LIKE NORWEGIANS, I DON'T LIKE
OTHER COUNTRIES, LET'S LET THOSE
GUYS IN.
SHE SAID I DON'T
SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER WHAT HE
SAID WHEN HE WAS TALKING HIS
ROUGH TALK.
NOW YOU KNOW THE
CUES THEY ARE USING, RIGHT?
THE
PRESIDENT DIDN'T NECESSARILY SAY
SHITHOLE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S FAKE
NEWS.
HE MIGHT HAVE JUST SAID
SHITHOUSE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING?
THAT SOUND LOVELY.
MORE OF THIS
NONSENSE.
>>DO YOU REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT
SAYING WHY CAN'T WE HAVE MORE
IMMIGRANTS FROM NORWAY?
>>I REMEMBER HIM ASKING ABOUT
THE CONCEPT OF UNDERREPRESENTED
COUNTRIES AS A FIX, THIS WAS IN
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT REMOVING
THE DIVERSITY LOTTERY, AND HOW
WE CAN REALLOCATE THAT, AND I DO
REMEMBER HIM ASKING IF WE DO
THAT AND WE THEN ASSIGN THOSE
TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE
UNREPRESENTED, WE JUST
CONTINUING ON MERIT-BASED
IMMIGRATION?
>>THE LAST PART GETS UNDER MY
SKIN.
UNDERREPRESENTED COUNTRIES
-- AND NORWAY DOES HAVE FAR
GREATER WEALTH THAN, FOR
EXAMPLE, HAITI, OF COURSE THAT'S
TRUE.
BUT PART OF THE REASON WE
DON'T HAVE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS
COMING IN FROM NORWAY IS BECAUSE
THEY ARE DOING FINE IN NORWAY.
THEY HAD UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, A
MORE PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT,
THEY ARE GENERALLY WAY HAPPIER
FROM HERE, THAT'S BASED ON
ACTUAL STUDIES, NORTHERN
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE GENERALLY
PRETTY HAPPY.
THEY ARE ALSO
OVERALL ASTOUNDINGLY LIBERAL, SO
THEY DON'T WANT TO COME HERE TO
THIS DRACONIAN SYSTEM WHERE WE
HAVE THE FREE MARKET RUN AMOK
WITH NO REGULATIONS, ETC., AND
GREAT WEALTH DISPARITY.
THAT'S
PART OF THE REASON WE AREN'T AS
HAPPY AS NORTHERN EUROPE.
WHEN
THE IRISH CAME OVER TO AMERICA
THEY DIDN'T COME BECAUSE THEY
ARE LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT,
EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT IN
IRELAND, WE ARE ALL REALLY RICH,
DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE OUR
MANSIONS AND GO TO AMERICA?
NO,
THEY WERE DYING, THERE WAS THE
POTATO FAMINE, THEY LOOKED FOR A
NEW HOPE AND CAME TO AMERICA.
IF
WE SAY WE WANT A MERIT-BASED
SYSTEM, MERIT-BASED ON WHAT?
THE
IRISH AND ITALIANS AND JEWS AND
BLACKS AND LATINOS HAVE BEEN
TERRIFIC FOR AMERICA AND BUILD
AMERICA, A LOT OF THEM WITH
THEIR BARE HANDS, AND THEY
DIDN'T COME BECAUSE THEY WERE
ALREADY RICH.
WHAT OTHER MERIT
WOULD USE?
THE S.A.T.S?
AN I.Q.
TEST?
WE'VE NEVER DONE THAT.
GIVE US YOUR HUDDLED MASSES.
THEY MADE AMERICA GREAT BECAUSE
THEY WERE HUNGRY TO DO BETTER,
IN CASE OF THE IRISH LITERALLY,
THERE WAS A FAMINE GOING ON.
SO
THIS WHOLE IDEA OF A MERIT-BASED
SYSTEM, IT MEANS LET'S LET
RICH WHITE PEOPLE IN,
THAT'S GROSS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICA IS.
WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVEN TO
FIND A BETTER LIFE AND LIVE
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
ONE MORE FROM HER.
>>YOU SAID ON FOX NEWS THAT THE
PRESIDENT USED STRONG LANGUAGE,
WAS THAT STRONG LANGUAGE?
>>LET'S SEE.
STRONG LANGUAGE,
THERE WAS -- APOLOGIES, I DON'T
REMEMBER A SPECIFIC WORD.
WHAT I
WAS STRUCK WITH AS I'M SURE YOU
WERE AS WELL WAS JUST THE
GENERAL PROFANITY THAT WAS USED
IN THE ROOM BY ALMOST EVERYONE.
>>DID YOU HEAR ME USE
PROFANITY?
>>NO SIR, NEITHER DID I.
>>DID YOU HEAR SENATOR GRAHAM
USE PROFANITY?
>>I HEARD TOUGH LANGUAGE FROM
SENATOR GRAHAM, YES SIR.
>>WHAT DID HE SAY?
>>HE WAS IMPASSIONED, TO
UNDERSCORE A POINT I THINK HE
USED SOME STRONG LANGUAGE.
>>DO YOU CALL THAT THE STRONG
LANGUAGE HE USED REPEATED
EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD
SAID PRIOR TO THAT?
>>I REMEMBER SPECIFIC CUSS
WORDS BEING USED BY A
VARIETY OF MEMBERS.
>>JUST SAY IT.
WHAT DOES ROUGH
TALK MEAN?
WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHITHOLE AND
SHITHOUSE?
ROUGH TALK ISN'T
LIKE, BOY, I AM VEXED.
IT'S NOT
LIKE, I ROUGH TALK THEM AND RUN
THEM OFF.
OLD SCHOOL TYT
REFERENCE, GIT, GIT!
NO, THAT
MEANS CURSE WORDS LIKE SHITHOLE.
I THOUGHT CONSERVATIVES WERE
REAL TOUGH GUYS.
OH, WE ARE
GOING TO CALL IT LIKE IT IS, WE
LIKE TRUMP BECAUSE HE TELLS IT
LIKE IT IS.
ALL OF A SUDDEN I
GUESS HE'S SCARED, I GUESS
THAT'S YOUR BIG BOLD LEADER.
THEY ADMIT IT WAS ROUGH TALK,
YOU KNOW HE'S CURSING,
DENIGRATING, PUTTING THEM DOWN,
I GUESS THEY ARE TOO SCARED TO
SAY THE ACTUAL WORDS.
WHAT
HAPPENED, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TOUGH GUYS?
NO.
HE WANTS CREDIT
FROM HIS BASE BUT DOESN'T WANT
IT FOR ANYBODY ELSE.
THAT SOUND
LIKE A STANDARD POLITICIAN.
