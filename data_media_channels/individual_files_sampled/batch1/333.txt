Mohammed L sir he has severe epilepsy this machine delivers a precise dosage of a drug every hour to control the two-year-old seizures for 13 days now the electricity that powers it has come from solar panels the hospital like all in Gaza has not been given money for generator fuel the power goes off for one minute my son loses his life he should be in the ICU he needs an x-ray but he couldn't do that much of the rest of this pediatric hospital is in darkness it's happening because the FATA dominated Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is refusing to release money until Hamas hands over the taxes it gathers inside Gaza both sides agreed in October that the PA would take over governing here but deadlines keep being missed this is the intensive care unit and twelve days ago the doctors here had to take really the incredibly difficult decision to close the unit to save electricity it's very energy and electricity intensive in here and that power can be diverted to keep the rest of the hospital open there are five beds here and the three that were occupied or those patients have been transferred to another hospital they get at most six hours of electricity a day here the rest of the time generators keep people alive the hospital director who's worked through all Garza's crises and wars over the last 25 years tells us he's never seen it so bad but the Farhan if someone comes up to midnight with something critical sometimes we can save his life in five minutes when we have electricity we needed to give electric shocks for resuscitation for x-rays for everything in the few rooms with power are crowded patients and parents some of these children have contagious diseases like viral meningitis they should not be kept like this but the hospital director says they have no option it risks a wider outbreak of disease and that's potentially catastrophic in this densely popular sealed-off enclave of almost 2 million people Burnett Smith al Jazeera Gaza
