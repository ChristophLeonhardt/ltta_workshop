this is our fifth day here in Israel where Attica boots called Misgav um and it is on the border with Lebanon Syria off in the distance and Israel and I just wanted to talk a little bit about the proximity to Lebanon in some of the houses behind me that fence down there is the fence between this kibbutz and Lebanon and I want to point out something that we noticed when we were speaking to the people who work on the kibbutz so down there in the distance you'll see where it's green it's being farmed there's businesses and Industry and over here in Lebanon there's houses sure but there's no businesses there's no malls there's no farm you can see this is clearly the same chunk of mountain but there's no farming and that's because all those houses down there the people who live there they're funded to live there this close to Israel by Hezbollah there they live a very comfortable life they don't really have to work there job is being next door to Israel to make Israel uncomfortable and you'll notice too a lot of the houses down there don't have glass in their windows and that's because they shoot from those windows into Israel at this kibbutz here another thing that we noticed earlier was that the UN doesn't patrol here the United Nations actually patrols on the Lebanon side and we found out today that the UN had to send Muslim soldiers from Indonesia to patrol in Lebanon because the Lebanese army and the Hezbollah were attacking the Christian soldiers that had been there another last point I want to make about this little town right behind us you don't see a mosque there but you also don't see a church and that was part of the agreement of that town was it used to be 50/50 Muslim and Christian town but after the last war the Christians refused to fight on the side of Hezbollah and now roughly that community over there is only 3% christian remaining for the rabble media I'm Sheila Gunn read it's our fifth date here in Israel I'm on the Lebanese border to see all of our coverage from our trip to Israel go to rebel Israel calm
