♪ ♪ Juan: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEW ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI IS RAISING ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS AFTER HIS LATEST MEDIA BLITZ. THE FORMER MAYOR, NOW SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT COMPLY WITH A SPECIAL COUNSEL SUBPOENA. WE DON'T HAVE TO. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE CAN ASSERT THE SAME PRIVILEGES OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE. PRESIDENT CLINTON NEGOTIATED A DEAL WHEN HE DIDN'T NEGOTIATE THE EFFECTIVENESS Juan: LAYER GIULIANI IS UNSURE IF THE PRESIDENT WILL PLEAD THE FIFTH. ARE YOU CONFIDENT THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT TAKE THE FIFTH IN THIS CASE? HOW CAN I BE CONFIDENT OF THAT? WHAT I WHEN I AM FACING A SITUATION WITH THE PRESIDENT AND ALL THE OTHER LAWYERS ARE. THEY THINK HE WOULD BE A FOOL TO TESTIFY. I HAVE A CLIENT WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY. Juan: MR. TRUMP'S ATTORNEY NOT RULING OUT IF MICHAEL COHEN MADE PAYMENTS TO OTHER WOMEN ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT. IF IT WAS NECESSARY, YES. HE MADE PAYMENTS FOR THE PRESIDENT OR HE CONDUCTED BUSINESS FOR THE PRESIDENT WHICH MEANS HE HAD LEGAL FEES, MONIES LAID OUT, AND EXPENDITURES. WHICH I HAVE ON MY BILLS. TO MY CLIENTS. Juan: IS RUDY GIULIANI HELPING OR HURTING HIS CLIENT, THE PRESIDENT? I WILL ASK YOU TO START US OFF. Brian: I THINK THE TONE HE IS SETTING IS EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS. HE'S AGGRESSIVE. ENOUGH SITTING ON MY HANDS. YOU WANT A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER? YOU CAN HAVE IT. I HOPE YOU DON'T CALL ME FOR A MEETING. YOU'RE INTERVIEWING MY FRIENDS. YOU ARE HASSLING MY FAMILY. IT'S OKAY. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WHAT RUDY GIULIANI HAS TO DO IS INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING. EVEN IF HE HAS THE BEST OR WORST PLAN, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW. THE COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WHAT BUT HE WAS DOING AND THE REST OF THE TEAM DIDN'T KNOW. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUDY GIULIANI KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. I DON'T THE KEY WAS THAT SURPRISED. I TALKED TO DAN FOR A HALF-HOUR ON RADIO, HALF AN HOUR ON "FOX & FRIENDS," 20 MINUTES ON THE PHONE THE DAY BEFORE. THERE WAS NO PANIC, KNOW WHAT HAVE I DONE HERE. HE FELT AS IF HE WAS ON PATH. WHAT HE HAS TO DO IS COME BACK AND SAY WE HAVE TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE. IN ONE WAY, I THINK HE HAD SET THE TONE WHICH WAS POSITIVE AND IN ANOTHER WAY, HE SET THEM BACK ON THE STORMY DANIELS SITUATION. Juan: DANA, I THINK YOU WERE STRUCK BY THE THINGS THAT BRIAN JUST HAD. FOLKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE WERE LIKE, WE DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS COMING. ALL KINDS OF SHOCK AT THIS. IN ADDITION TO WHICH THE SUGGESTION THERE MAY BE MORE PAYMENTS CAME AS AN ABSOLUTE UNSETTLING FACTOR. Dana: THERE IS A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT AMONG SOME PEOPLE THAT IT'S BETTER FOR THE PRESS SECRETARY ARE PEOPLE DOING COMMUNICATIONS, FOR THEM NOT TO KNOW CERTAIN THINGS BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THEM FROM SOMETHING. I'VE NEVER SUBSCRIBED TO THAT THEORY BUT I KNOW IT EXISTS. IT WILL TURN OUT HOWEVER IT TURNS OUT. THE ONLY THING I AM FOCUSED ON IS SOMETHING THAT I ASKED THE LEGAL SCHOLAR AT BERKELEY. VERY ACCOMPLISHED LAWYER. HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND HOW THEY HAVE TO INTERACT. I SAID WHAT IS THE SETTLED LAW OF WHETHER A PRESIDENT CAN IGNORE A SUBPOENA FROM THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. HE SAID IT'S THE ONE THING THAT'S NEVER BEEN DECIDED BY A SUPREME COURT. COULD BE THE FIRST TIME IT'S DECIDED. Juan: THE COURT SAID YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE DOCUMENTS. THE QUESTION IS ABOUT THE TESTIMONY. BY THE WAY, KIMBERLY, YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY RUDY IS NEW TO THIS. HE WILL GET HIS FACTS STRAIGHT. WELL, IS RUDY ON THE PAGE OR NOT? Kimberly: RUDY IS ON THE PAGE. THAT'S ACTUALLY A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. THEY ARE VERY CLOSE. HE RELIES ON HIS COUNSEL. HE'S COME ONTO THE CASE QUICKLY. HE IS CATCHING UP, GETTING A BEAT ON EVERYTHING. HE'S GOING THROUGH IT. PROTECT THE PRESIDENT, PROTECT THE FAMILY. HE'S TRYING TO BE FORTHRIGHT AND TRANSPARENT MEANS THE QUESTIONS. NOT RULING ANYTHING OUT OR IN. A SMART LAWYER DOESN'T CLOSE DOORS. EVALUATE IT. CASE-BY-CASE DETERMINATION AND BASES HERE. IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE TO TESTIFY OR TAKE THE FIFTH, THERE ARE OTHER LEGAL HURDLES AND CHALLENGES. YOU'VE HAD SOME KEY RULINGS THAT HAVE BENEFITED THE PRESIDENT WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE FEDERAL JUDGES PUT A STOP TO SOME OF THE NONSENSE, SAYING IT'S TOO WIDE A SCOPE. WE WANT TO SEE THE MEMOS. CAN'T JUST ENGAGE IN A FISHING EXPEDITION AND TRY TO REEL IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HIS FAMILY MEMBERS, AND ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH OR HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS. I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME LEGAL HURDLES. NOT TO MENTION HOW MANY PEOPLE HE MIGHT HAVE COMING FORWARD WITH TESTIMONY BETTER GOING TO HAVE NO CREDIBILITY WHATSOEVER IN TERMS OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. WHO IS GOING TO BE LEFT TO TESTIFY WHO HASN'T MADE INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS OR RESIGN FROM THE FBI OR WRITTEN A BOOK? Juan: TWO PEOPLE LEFT OUT OF THIS. ONE, APPARENTLY JARED IS DISPOSABLE. IVANKA IS OFF LIMITS. DON'T GO AFTER IVANKA. MICHAEL COLLINS HAS YESTERDAY, MICHAEL COHEN MAY BE COOPERATING WITH MUELLER. Greg: I WATCHED A LOT OF THE COVERAGE WHEN I'M AT THE GYM, NOT BY CHOICE. THE REASON WHY I HATE IT SO MUCH AND MOST OF AMERICA HATES IT, IT'S LAWYERS INTERVIEWING LAWYERS ABOUT WHAT A LAWYER SAID. WHAT ARE THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT THEY SAID? WE ARE NOT SURE. LET'S GET A PANEL AND TALK ABOUT IT. THIS STORY IS SELF FUELED HYSTERIA GENERATED BY THOSE IN THE MEDIA WHO FEED OFF IT INSIDE THEIR BUBBLE AND THEY DON'T CARE THAT OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE AMERICA REALLY DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN. WE DON'T CARE. THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, TV EXECUTIVE SAYING SHOULD WE DO STORMY OR MUELLER? SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT STORMING. LET'S GET A PANEL AND TO TALK ABOUT IT. LET'S GET THE LEGAL PANEL TO PARSE THE WORDS. THEN WE GET THE NEXT PANEL FOR THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS. WHILE THIS IS ALL GOING ON, SOMEONE ELSE WILL START THE PROCESS OVER AGAIN BY SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT MUELLER SO THAT YOU CAN SWITCH FROM STORMY TO MUELLER. MEANWHILE TRUMP'S NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GO UP. AMERICA GETS INCREDIBLY FED UP AND BURNED OUT BY THIS AND I'M TELLING YOU THERE'S GOING TO BE A REBOUND TO THIS THAT'S GOING TO HELP TRUMP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT LAWYERS AND EXPERTS TALK ABOUT SUBPOENAS AND SUMMARIZING FACTS THAT WE DON'T GIVE A FLYING CRAP ABOUT. Brian: THOSE JUDGES WHO MADE THOSE COMMENTS, THEY CAME ON SAID YOU DON'T WANT PAUL MANAFORT. YOU WANT TRUMP. THE OTHER ONE SAYS YOU HAD AN INDICTMENT. ONE YOU PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE INDICTMENT?
