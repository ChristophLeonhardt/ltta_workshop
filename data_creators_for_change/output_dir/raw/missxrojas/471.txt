1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,460
Pittsburgh is such a walkable<font color="#CCCCCC"> city I</font>

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's a large part of why I</font>

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,060
enjoyed my visit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pittsburgh number 28</font>

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,010
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 29 of january two thousand eleven</font>

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,750
such a great deal it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,490
different experience we had from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,109
walkable cities in front of the kind of

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,150
city that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you experience through subways</font>

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">and metros and cars and you know that</font>

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:21,900
necessitates<font color="#E5E5E5"> add some forms of</font>

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,820
transportation like the freedom to walk

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,119
is incredible and it feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful</font>

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,369
this all sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> very pretentious coming</font>

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,990
from someone who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just ridiculously</font>

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,030
interested in how like we move through

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,520
space and how kind of we arrange space

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,890
and how we perceive<font color="#CCCCCC"> states because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,690
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> English at university you can walk</font>

19
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,280
basically everywhere in downtown

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,989
Pittsburgh the north side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the south</font>

21
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,820
side all connected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this glorious</font>

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,890
bridges whilst I was in Pittsburgh I

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,480
spent some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time with my friend Jules we</font>

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
went to the ante warhol museum together

29
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,320
there wasn't an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bad</font>

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,059
feeling or resentment between the

31
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,430
students Pittsburgh and the townspeople

32
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,199
because everyone is very United but this

33
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,180
love for the Pittsburgh Steelers the

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,590
American football<font color="#E5E5E5"> team you see this</font>

35

everywhere everyone is wearing black and

<font color="#CCCCCC">yellow in Pittsburgh and funnily enough</font>

37
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">somo today it's as though shock people</font>

38
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,790
feel like if they do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

39
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,680
biggest fan is that they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be run out</font>

40
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,439
of the city the bosses have it on their

41
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,390
little flashes foods I took a bus the

42
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,189
two dollars twenty-five to Oakland which

43
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,840
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a university area which you</font>

44
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,729
could walk to you theoretically the

lighted near the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cathedral of learning</font>

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,659
there's a big story as to why carnitas

and so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> names around Pittsburgh my</font>

50
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,049

<font color="#E5E5E5">after i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> returned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from Pittsburgh if</font>

53
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,549
your father or will compete here it

54
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,960
the library<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself is absolutely</font>

55
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,970
beautiful but it's a great great great

56
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,560
great part about this trip was that I

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see when friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt and Nora my</font>

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,650
visit them together our<font color="#E5E5E5"> almond bear cub</font>

59
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,700
and they perform and they're just

60
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely brilliant</font>

61
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,880
as always I felt very<font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky to be their</font>

62
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,770
friends I also saw my really lovely very

63
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,630
talented secret brother John who was

64
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,370
kind of the start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showed the evening</font>

65
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,710
he was giving a talk as part of the

66
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,440
Pittsburgh arts and lectures series

67
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,240
being an English major himself I believe

68
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,600
he talked in part about maps right we

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,880
know what the world looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

70
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,060
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but the map also shapes</font>

71
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,120
the world and so we must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful and</font>

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,610
thoughtful cartographers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you</font>

73
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,260
that into the fact that map shapes the

74
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,550
world let me show you a map from

75
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">Australia</font>

76
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,480
the only reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that norton is up of</font>

77
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,390
course is because we're in the north I

78
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,220
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful and</font>

79
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,720
thoughtful cartographers for ourselves

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,120
and for each other because the maps that

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,830
we draw through the stories that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we tell</font>

82
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,260
and the way we imagine the world around

83
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,220
us shape our understanding of ourselves

84
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,190
others and the world we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about space</font>

85
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> foot English made it to do that was</font>

86
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,150
so much fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only got a couple of clips</font>

87
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,680
of this talk because I was so busy kind

88
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,700
of listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and just like</font>

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,230
thinking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my favorite</font>

90
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">Clips would actually have to be this</font>

91
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,380
little piece of footage and authority

92
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,180
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the interpreting will and I'm</font>

93
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,430
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why patrolman john was</font>

94
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,230
filming the projection of his own face

95
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,390
talking about the French Revolution

96
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,160
after the talk there was so many

97
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,209
nerdfighters round

98
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">matan Laura continue to play I continue</font>

99
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to poke around the library completely in</font>

100
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,700
order the amazing teen section that this

101
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,280
library had also looks like the grown-up

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,050
fiction section as well and do promise

103
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,670
but I just get very excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> because teen</font>

104
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,380
fiction it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that isn't really</font>

105
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,880
embraced as much as it should be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

106
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,740
UK and then to see the slime just

107
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,840
stuffed full of teen fiction was

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,210
absolutely breathtaking at the end of it

109
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was talking to Matt and Lauren and</font>

110
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,660
join army were all just saying like it

111
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,940
just it was overwhelming the feeling was

112
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I kept describing I 2008 but it</font>

113
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,110
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like terminus and it</font>

114
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,579
wasn't really like a date it was

115
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,770
something simultaneously completely new

116
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,750
and completely old and nostalgic and you

117
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,370
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of grab onto it and</font>

118
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,020
keep on to it forever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know how</font>

119
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,820
to describe it it was like I felt I've

120
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,610
been like smacked in the face by a wing

121
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a swan of Awesome and it was just</font>

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,870
riding through the sky and I'm just

123
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,580
great that evening reminded me of the

124
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,140
power of wonderful moments and wonderful

125
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,910
experiences and when my bus break down

126
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,340
on the way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pittsburgh i was thinking</font>

127
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,020
like why did I do this I you know I

128
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">spent a little only spend those money</font>

129
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,780
but I said a bit of money getting here

130
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,790
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend money kind of eating</font>

131
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,440
out here and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
stayed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just gone ahead with my</font>

133
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,650
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font>

134
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,420
really boring to say but I was generally

135
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,340
thinking like this wasn't really a

136
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,840
practical decision when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get there</font>

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these experiences you feel like</font>

138
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,230
these are why you go and adventures you

139
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,710
going to register these really amazing

140
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,230
safe but simultaneously like explosive

141
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,720
and brilliant feelings and these moments

142
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,670
are loud and happy and fun and

143
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,830

144
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,900
they're also<font color="#E5E5E5"> members kind of quiet</font>

145
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,350
