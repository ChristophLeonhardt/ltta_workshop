this morning the Trump administration killed a dream let's watch the program known as daca that was effectuated under the obama administration is being rescinded the executive branch through daca deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch so if you're not familiar with the daca is deferred action for childhood arrivals it is the people who are taking it are called dreamers because they're living the American dream they were brought here when they were young children all brought before they were adults so they could not commit a volitional act to enter the country they didn't do anything wrong and most of them have spent all their lives here some of them don't even know any other language let alone any other home so let me give you details on how they kill that dream in a phone call with reporters Tuesday morning a Department of Homeland Security official said on background that current daca beneficiaries whose permits expired before March 5th of 2018 would be eligible to reapply for an extra two years of protected status however that means hundreds of thousands of people whose permits expire after March 5th would be eligible for deportation as early as the next day ABC News first reported so some people get a six-month reprieve and or or for six months they still gonna reprieve for up to two years but anyone who is not renewed by that time can be kicked out immediately hundreds of thousands of daca recipients with permits expiring after that date however could soon see the information they gave the government as part of the program's application used to deport them so when Obama said hey if you register we're not going to deport you Trump says just kidding we're gonna use that information to deport you it's a gross violation of trust and it's disastrous in many ways as I'll explain here okay the official claim the Department of Homeland Security will not take action to remove active daca beneficiaries the transfer information from USCIS to ice that's the custom officials and immigration officials would only take place where there is a significant law enforcement or national security interest that is of course not true this is exactly what Trump said about no no when I ate an office I went to prioritize keying out the criminals first and we are not going to go after non criminal undocumented immigrants and then they went after them blatant violation of what he had said earlier of course he's a pathological liar does it every time and his target Points Memo explains here an acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Holman said in late July that deportations of non criminal documented immigrants had in fact gone from zero to 100 under Trump's watch so when he said that they wouldn't go after them it was just not true he's not telling the truth today so if you were part of the protection of daca you unfortunately a big group of you will no longer have that protection at all I'm going to tell you how devastating that is in a second for how many people are involved first of all there's 800,000 people at a minimum that could be affected I give you one haunting fact that we mentioned on the show last week 16% of them owned houses if you got rid of all them all of a sudden you would have ghost towns in so many places in America gigantic amount of hundreds of thousands homes would be empty let alone the cars it's it's something out of a horror movie or maybe this is their version of haha you know you're gone and the good people stay I don't know they're just they're horrible people okay Jeff Sessions said ending the previous administration is disrespect for the legislative process is an important first step now what they're referring to is hey Obama did an executive order on daca Obama's about to explain that in a second but keep in mind that they're among the very first things that Donald Trump did was an executive order on immigration in his case it was to ban Muslims from certain countries what happened I thought executive orders on immigration were unacceptable and unconstitutional no no no what it's filled with hate it's totally constitutional when you're actually trying to protect people living the American dream almost all of whom have gone to high school and then college or the military and they almost all of whom are employed and productive members of society that's filled with love so that's unconstitutional if you fill an executive order with fear and hatred that's constitutional that's a great legal principle to go on okay so Obama explains why it happened the way that it did he cuz he wrote about it today and you know they say Oh ex presidents aren't supposed to talk about what the current president is doing are there any rules left are you insane Donald Trump in attacking the Obama non-stop so it's all his fault he was a loser president okay so Obama did a gentlemanly post on Facebook Wow anyway here's what he explained in regards to why it was an executive order he said in four years while I was president I asked Congress to send me such a bill referring to a bill that would actually codify daca said that bill never came and because it made no sense to expel talented driven patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country we did so based on the well established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion deployed by the Democratic and Republican presidents alike because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm and then he went on to explain how he broke the record on deportations of criminal undocumented immigrants so but this was all not good enough for Donald Trump he said but we must also recognize that we're a nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws now that's funny cuz they're gonna talk about rule of law online I thought that he just pardon sheriff joe arpaio who refused to listen to the rule of law Sheriff Joe didn't just break any old crime where a you a pardon an immediate pardon like the one that trumped it would have been questionable to begin with but no the crime that Joe Arpaio committed was one of ignoring the rule of law altogether a court gave him an order and he said I don't care about the law I don't care about the courts I'm just not gonna follow the law back then trumping care about the rule of law at all back then as in like a week ago now and that guys of course went after one of the his original crime are Pyro's was that he would illegally detail Latinos when it was not his jurisdiction and he was targeting not criminals on probable cause but just Latinos so if you hate Latinos and you're racist that we don't need the rule of law but if you like Latinos or immigrants and you find productive members of society who are Latino who cares kick them out all of a sudden we care about the rule of law gigantic hypocrites Trump said there can be no path to principled immigration reform if the executive branch is able to rewrite or nullify federal laws at will hmm like your executive order on the Muslim ban like you're rewriting the law on Sheriff Joe Arpaio but when it comes to racism and bigotry you love it and you hate the rule of law and don't care about the law at all just at least have the decency to admit it of course he won't now we go to Huckabee Sanders who is going to be shilling for this law and again speak us for this action and speaking once again unbearably about the rule of law watch you know there's a lot of people that I've seen attacking the president for not showing the level of compassion that they feel like he should it's not cold-hearted for the president to uphold the law we're a nation of law and order and the day that we start to ignore the fact that we are that then we throw away everything that gives these people a reason to want to come to our country if we stop becoming the country that we were envisioned to be then we throw away what makes us special which makes America you this president's not willing to do that the previous administration was this one isn't but we want to have real solutions we want to have laws that that address these problems but it's Congress's job to legislate not the president well somebody for Christ's sake ask her about Joe Arpaio it just happened she's like wow man I know today wouldn't even want to come to this country if for example a court gave an order and then the president decided he was a dictator and ripped it up and said no as long as you hate Latinos you don't have to follow the court order at all you don't have to follow the law all the law doesn't mean anything as long as you hate Latinos somebody asks for the goddamn question they don't care about the rule of law at all how about the the law that says the president can I get enriched by foreign governments while he's in office Trump is getting enriched today through his hotels through his properties through the gifts that he's getting how about that law no no but the president would like to get rich so he doesn't care about that law how about the law about obstruction of justice where you can't fire someone investigating you no no the laws don't apply to the king you see this is such a great country because we have a dictator like Donald Trump and that's why people are coming here somebody just asked with goddamn questions all right now we're gonna hear from Kris Kobach now Kris Kobach is not part of the federal government he's a podunk secretary of state in a looser state like Kansas I don't mean overall I mean it's because it's run by looser Republicans like Sam Brownback who bankrupted the state and then ran away okay Kobach is still there so why the hell's this loser on national television because he's the one that helped craft this law because he's one of the most anti-immigrant people in the countries you need someone to hate Latinos you call Kris Kobach so Kris Kobach is on TV now defending this law let's watch angel Romero he was brought here illegally when he was 2 years old and I want you to listen to what he has to say here I basically got the message that my country doesn't want me here if it's trying to get rid of me and that was very confusing if you could talk to somebody like camera to somebody like hey-zeus Contreras who is a paramedic working in Houston who is he under the daca program he's a dreamer what is your message individually to him a couple of things one is that he's gotten a great gift from the American taxpayer he's gotten the best free public education in the Western Hemisphere and you know he should be grateful because we've the taxpayers have paid for that and we're saying look if I'd be part of the American country then do it legally go to the home country they're also paying taxes when they're tax payer they're relying on themselves as well right well no no that's not correctly the vast majority do not pay enough in taxes to compensate for the benefits that they are receiving from the government so there are net takers from the system God named and II hate these folks all right let me give you the actual facts let's go to graphics 53 a through 54 the new American economy a coalition of business leaders and mayor's who support immigration reforms that will help create jobs for Americans today at least as they explain it estimated the daca eligible population earns almost nineteen point nine billion dollars in total income annually contributes more than 1.4 billion dollars of federal taxes more than 1.6 billion dollars of state local taxes and represents almost sixteen point eight billion dollars in spending power which could all disappear overnight if daca is ended in these people are actually deported now here's one more fact for you guys reversing the deferred action for childhood arrivals program could cost the economy 215 billion dollars in lost GDP and cost the federal government sixty billion dollars in lost revenue over ten years and that is according to the libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute that is not necessarily in favor of immigration at all certainly not undocumented immigrants but that right-wing think-tank says well I mean if you're gonna be honest that is their contribution to the economy and it is significant that does not take an effect that a lot of these guys are very well-educated by definition if they're part of daca if they're dreamers they have to go either go to college or join the military and if they're that well-educated what Cato Institute explains is that they're still relatively young they're earning power will only increase that the amount of taxes they paid going forward only increase and remember if you're undocumented a lot of times you pay in for the payroll tax but never get Social Security or Medicare because you are not documented so let alone the sales tax tax they also pay the payroll tax but Kris Kobach doesn't want you to know any of that it's not that he's worried about the economy if he was worried about the economy they wouldn't help Sam Brownback destroyed Kansas economy it's not about the economy it's about hate it's about race it's about fear that's what Kobach and Trump feed on so this could be one more from Coe back here how does this consistent then ending daca with the president's promise to take care of dreamers that these dreamers should rest easy how does that square well I'm not sure what the president meant when he said rest easy and who knows but the point is yeah yeah who cares that's the only thing that's slightly honest that Kovacs ever said the president's a liar anyone who cares what he said earlier it was messin with you you're an idiot for believing him his name was Donald Trump was the last time he ever said anything that he meant who cares what he meant we're against Latinos get it through your head here's a Republican congressman Carlos Rubio who goes on right afterwards and he nails what this is actually about I had the secretary of state of Kansas on this show Kris Kobach who said that dreamers should go back to their home countries and quote get in line I'd like your reaction to that it's regrettable that some fringe elements in our politics have a sick obsession with scapegoating immigrants for blaming them for all of our economic struggles in this country so that's the Republican congressman saying that not a Democratic congressman but it unfortunately is not a fringe element it's the President of the United States of America that's the sick element that has taken over the Republican Party and don't pretend he's not one of you you had 17 choices and the Republican voters said forget Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio and all these other senators and former governors all these establishment folks know I want that monster name Donald Trump now final peace for you guys on how much of an effect this has more than 97% of dreamers are in school or in the workforce 5% said of their own business 65% have purchased the vehicle and 16% have purchased their first home at least 72 percent of the top 25 fortune 500 companies count daca recipients among their employees they are taking some of the best of us and wanting to remove them from our country and these folks didn't do anything wrong we were putting the sins of the parents onto the sense of the children the people who are supposed to know better are supposed to be good Christians who read in their Bible that you're not supposed to do that instead of course all over social media their right-wing evangelical pastors going around saying congratulations huzzah and so why do they do that because they don't view Latinos as part of us and of course this doesn't affect just Latinos but that's their worldview and it doesn't matter if you're from a different country you're a foreigner we don't want you what happened I thought you were only going to go after the criminals yeah we were just lying we were just lying we don't like them our voters don't like them we're going to target it target them and eliminate them so and by the way one last thing for you guys they have a a new bill that Tom cotton is introducing too and that Donald Trump has supported he supported it earlier this month and what is it do it not only goes after the dreamers it not only goes after undocumented immigrants it also goes after legal immigrants so when they said oh it's about the rule of law they never meant it it's you're just not in their definition of us US is what Steve Bannon calls culturally American in other words white people and if you're not part of that they're gonna come after you no matter what support independent media come join us
