37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,930
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are three key factors that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">using to start my next lock set I think</font>

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,590
I want to start them via interlocking

40
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,610
because I could do that right away I

41
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,920
really benefit from like washing

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,079
consistently at least once a week is

43
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,450
kind of a must for me and so starting at

44
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">via comb coils is not really that good</font>

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,799
of an idea and my first set was started

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,540
by cone quills and it took so long for

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,970
my ear lock a second method i am

48
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,819
considering is the amount of locks<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

49
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,620
want to have when i commed out my

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,150
a set<font color="#E5E5E5"> of locks I made a vow to myself</font>

51
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,459
that I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have my locks be if I</font>

52
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,379
got locks again I would not have them be

53
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,650
any smaller than the size of like the

54
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,840
width of a pencil just because combing

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,879
them out was so tedious the smaller ones

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,560
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh but you know I look at</font>

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,860
someone like Joyce md um and there's

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">another I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's locked crush I</font>

59
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,959
think her name's a lot crush with all of

60
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,000
these locks on their head and I feel

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,709
like that fills out your hair a little

62
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,760
bit more you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so for now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,790
considering having anywhere from 250 to

64
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,099
300 locks so that way starting off with

65
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,230
that many so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way as I'm going along</font>

66
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">on my journey if I want to combine a few</font>

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,269
I can the third thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm battling</font>

68
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,909
or trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out is parting and</font>

69
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,680
how I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go about it you know</font>

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's like there's a plethora of</font>

71
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,829
different parting options you can use

72
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,780
but right now I'm kind of debating

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,349
between just you know simple brick

74
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,170
square method thing you know nothing too

75
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,489
crazy thought of or the c-shaped part

76
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,200
I've been hearing a lot of that's like a

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,060
new buzz I'm hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the c-shaped</font>

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,829
part those news report this news take

79
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,470
part so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the three things that</font>

80
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,379
i'm currently grappling with starting to

81
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,349
be interlocking having somewhere between

82
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,410
250 and 300 locks on my head and then

83
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,160
finally using maybe the c-shaped part in

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,959
the comments below let me know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

85
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,590
