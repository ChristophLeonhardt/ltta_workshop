. MARK: HELLO, AMERICA, I'M MARK LEVIN, AND THIS IS "LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN," AND IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE DR. DAVID BERLINSKI WITH US. HOW ARE YOU, SIR? I'M JUST FINE, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MARK: THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL THE WAY FROM PARIS TO OUR LITTLE PLACE. WAS ENDLESS. MARK: OKAY, IMAGINE 100 YEARS AGO. THAT WAS ENDLESS. IT WAS WORSE. MY TRIP WAS WORSE. MARK: DAVID BERLINSKI. I WANT TO TALK TODAY WITH YOU IN YOUR UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO DO THIS, ABOUT EVOLUTION, SCIENCE AND PROGRESSIVISM BECAUSE THERE'S A LINK. YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS AND SPOKEN ABOUT THIS MANY, MANY TIMES. YOU RECEIVED YOUR Ph.D. IN PHILOSOPHY FROM PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. LATER A POST DOCTORAL FELLOW IN MATHEMATICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. GLAD I DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE COURSES. YOU TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY, MATHEMATICS, ENGLISH AT STANFORD, RUTGERS, UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AND IN PARIS AND THE EDITOR OF INFERENCE INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SCIENCE. LET'S GET STARTED. YOU WROTE A BOOK ABOUT A DECADE AGO THEY READ ABOUT A DECADE AGO. AND IN DOING THIS PROGRAM, I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT IT, AND I SAID, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT SCIENCE, EVOLUTION, PROGRESSIVISM, AND I WANT TO START WHERE YOU STARTED. LET ME READ YOU ONE PARAGRAPH. "I'M A SECULAR JEW, YOU WRITE. MY RELIGIOUS EDUCATION DID NOT TAKE. I CAN BARELY REMEMBER A WORD OF HEBREW, I CANNOT PRAY. I'VE SPENT MORE YEARS THAN I CARE TO REMEMBER IN STUDYING MATHEMATICS AND WRITING ABOUT THE SCIENCES. YET, AS YOU WROTE IN THE PREFACE OF THIS BOOK, THE BOOK THAT FOLLOWS IS IN SOME SENSE A DEFENSE OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND SENTIMENT. BIBLICAL VERSES ARE THE LEAST OF IT, A DEFENSE IS NEEDED BECAUSE NONE HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING. THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN CEDED TO MEN WHO REGARD RELIGIOUS BELIEF WITH FRIVOLOUS CONTEMPT. THE BOOKS HAVE POURED FROM EVERY PRESS AND DIFFERING WIDELY IN STYLE, THEY ARE IDENTICAL IN MESSAGE BECAUSE SCIENTIFIC THEORIES ARE TRUE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, MUST BE FALSE. FROM YOUR BOOK "THE DEVIL'S DELUSION," ATHEISM AND SCIENTIFIC PRETENSIONS. AND THAT IS THE THESIS, THAT IS THE FOUNDATIONAL POINT OF YOUR BOOK. YOU CAN EXPAND ON THAT? WELL, SOMETHING, SOMETHING PARTICULAR AND PECULIAR SEEMS TO HAVE COME OVER ANGLOAMERICAN INTELLECTUAL LIFE IN. THE 1950s AND THE 60s, THE POSITION THAT WAS ACADEMICALLY TOLERATED WAS A CHEERFUL AGNOSTISSISM WITH RESPECT TO GOD'S EXISTENCE, MAYBE, MAYBE NOD, BUT THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE THAT VEXES US AS PROFOUNDLY AS MEMBERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AT ALL CHANGES. NOW VERY VOCIFEROUS AND DOGMATIC ATH DOGMATIC AT DOGMATIC ATHEISM IS OBLIGATORY, ESTABLISHED PHYSICALISTS MAY BE PLANNING JIHAD, I HAVE NO IDEA. BUT BY AND LARGE, ATHEISM HAS REPLACED FOREBEARING AGONISTISSISM IN THE ANGLO-AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC LIFE. AND AS A RESULT, THE RELIGIOUS TRADITION IS A VERY, VERY LONG 5,000-YEAR-OLD TRADITION HAS BEEN MADE INTO AN OBJECT OF FAINT DERISION AMONG SOPHISTICATED MEN AND WOMEN MUCH TO THE CONSTERNATION OF PEOPLE WHO DEEPLY, DEEPLY ADMIRE THAT TRADITION, AND THAT, I THINK, IS A CHANGE IN THE DIOPACIN OF LIFE THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. IT IS RELATIVELY NEW, STARTED AROUND 1980, '85 BUT BECOME AN ACCELERATING FORCE IN INTLECK WAL LIFE. IF YOU ARE MINDED TO BE A SERIOUS CHRISTIAN OR EXTREMELY DEVOUT AND ORTHODOX JEW OR EVEN A SERIOUS MUSLIM, BETTER NOT GO INTO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND TELL YOUR FRATERNITY BROTHERS THAT THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE. BEST TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH CLOSED. THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE, IT'S AMONG THE VARIOUS TOPICS ABOUT WHICH IT IS NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE BROADCAST YOUR VIEWS. MARK: AND THEN YOU ADD FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR POINT AND YOU SAY BASICALLY SCIENCE IS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT LIFE AND LOVE AND DEATH AND MEANING. HARDLY A CONTROVERSIAL POINT, IS IT? I MEAN, IF I AM ASKING CERTAIN KINDS OF QUESTIONS. LOOK, LOOK AROUND YOU. THERE'S SOMETHING THERE. OPEN YOUR EYES, YOU'RE STRUCK BY THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNIVERSE. WHY IS THAT THERE? LOOK AT THE ANSWERS FORTHCOMING FROM THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY. THEY CAN BE DESCRIBED IN ONE OF TWO WAYS. WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? WE'RE HERE. THEREFORE THERE IS SOMETHING THERE. OR IT'S KIND OF AN ACCIDENT. THESE ARE NOT THE KIND OF ANSWERS INTELLIGENT MEN AND WOMEN ARE SEARCHING FOR. THEY CORRESPOND TO NO DEEP INTELLECTUAL NEED, THEY'RE FRIVOLOUS. PHYSICS HAS NOTHING TO TELL US, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT THE ORIGINS AND APPEARANCE OF THE UNIVERSE. IT HAS A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY ABOUT COSMOLOGY BUT NOT THE SAME QUESTION. THE MOST RADICAL QUESTION YOU CAN ASK IS: WHY IS THERE SOMETHING, ANYTHING RATHER THAN WHAT, NOTHING? WHY IS THAT? IT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE TO PROPOSE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING WHATSOEVER. I DON'T MEAN SOME PREEXISTING STUFF. I MEAN NOTHING. WELL, THAT'S NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. HOW COME? IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PHYSICISTS OR THE BIOLOGIST OR THE CHEMIST, THEIR ANSWER IS, WE KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. WE OPEN OUR EYES, TOO. THERE'S SOMETHING. AND WE CAN EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN OF ALL THAT BY APPEALING TO SOME PREEXISTING SOMETHING. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT? IF NOT, WELL, YOU'RE NOT SCIENTIFIC LITERATE. LAWRENCE KRAUS MAKES THAT ARGUMENT, THE PREEXISTING QUANTUM FIELD FROM WHICH IT AROSE. MARK: THEY HAVE NO REAL SOLID IDEA DO, THEY? NONE, WHATSOEVER. MARK: AND YET, THEY CONTINUE TO PUSH THEIR THEORIES OUT AS IF IT'S SCIENCE. WELL, LET'S BE FAIR, WOULDN'T YOU DO THE SAME THING IF YOU WERE A LEADING I SURE WOULD. IF I HAD A THEORY THAT DEEP DOWN I KNEW NO GOOD, BUT THERE ARE SORTS OF EMOLUMENTS, RICHNESS, AWARD, PRESTIGIOUS, I WOULD PUSH IT, DO I. MARK: WE GET THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE THE SAME SCIENTISTS CAN'T TELL. YOU TALKING ABOUT THE TOP PHYSICISTS. CLIMATE CHANGE, YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE BOTTOM. MARK: FOR A LOT OF US, IT'S JUST A MUSH OUT THERE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE SAYING THE TOP PHYSICISTS AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS, WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE, WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT CAN'T TELL US THE TEMPERATURE IN A WEEK WITHIN 10 DEGREES, BUT THEY CAN TELL US THE TEMPERATURE IN 100 YEARS WITHIN ONE DEGREE. WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU SAYING THE TOP PHYSICISTS. ISN'T IT PERVASIVE? ISN'T THIS A PERVASIVE PROBLEM THROUGHOUT SCIENCE? TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. LOOK, SCIENCE IS AN ENORMOUS ENTERPRISE. HOW MANY GUYS, HOW MANY WOMEN, MEN AND WOMEN AFFIRM THEMSELVES AS SCIENTISTS WORLDWIDE TODAY? DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE THE NUMBER? IT'S SEVEN MILLION. SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN THE SCIENTIFIC ENTERPRISE. AND, OF COURSE, YOU ARE GOING TO FIND VERY REPETITIVE SOCIOLOGICAL PATTERNS WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS ENVIRONMENT OR CLIMATE, YOU'RE GOING TO FIND GROUPS FORMING FACTIONS SPLITTING FROM THE GROUP, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROPAGANDA. ELABORATE NUMBER OF RESOURCES, A LOT OF MONEY TO BE HAD, NOT COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR, IT'S COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHEN I TALK ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE, WE'RE APPEALING TO THE VERY TOP OF THE INTELLECTUAL LADDER. WHEN I TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME COMPETENT PEOPLE, NOT MANY, SOME COMPETENT PEOPLE WITH MODERATELY CONFLICTING VIEWS, BOTH ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, YES, THE WORLD IS GETTING WARMER. THE NATURE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE RELIABILITY OF THE CLIMACTIC MODELS, THE THEORIES THAT GO INTO THEM AND PROGNOSTICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE. IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR EXACTLY WHICH GROUP HAS THE MOST OVERWHELMING AND PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE. MARK: WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TOP. IF YOU THINK THIS FELLOW, AT LEAST ARGUABLY, DARWIN, A LOT OF THEORIES, ARGUMENTS, SCIENCE, SO TO SPEAK WHAT IS DARWINISM. WHAT IS THAT? DARWIN COMES MID 19th CENTURY FIGURE, 1859, HE PUBLISHED WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE MASTERPIECE, THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES AND THE QUESTION THAT DARWIN ASKED HIMSELF IS A QUESTION THAT ALL THE 19th CENTURY BIOLOGISTS WERE ASKING, WHAT IS THE NATURE OF LIFE? WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES? HOW DID LIFE EMERGE FROM INORGANIC MATTER? AND WHAT ARE THE DYNAMIC LAWS THAT CHANGE ONE SPECIES INTO ANOTHER, IF THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A CHANGE OF SPECIES. DON'T FORGET ALCHEMY PROMOTED A VERY SIMILAR THESIS WHEN IT SAID BASE METALS COULD BE TRANSMUTED INTO GOLD. AN ARGUMENT FOR TRANSMUTATION OF ELEMENTS. DARWIN PROVIDED AN ALCHEMICAL EXPLANATION FOR BIOLOGY. SPECIES COULD BE TRANSFORMED INTO OTHER SPECIES. HOW COULD THIS COME ABOUT? WE DON'T SEE IT EVERY DAY. IT COMES ABOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE SMALL VARIATIONS WITHIN EACH SPECIES AND THESE VARIATIONS ARE SEIZED UPON BY THE MECHANISM OF NATURAL SELECTION WHICH SIMPLY MEANS SOME SURVIVE, SOME DON'T SURVIVE. OVER VAST PERIODS OF TIME, THESE SMALL VARIATIONS ACCUMULATE, THEY CONVERGE ON A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE AND VARIOUS DIFFERENT STRUCTURES IN TURN CONVERGE ON A NEW BODY, PLANT, ORG OR ORGANISM OF SPECIES, THAT'S DARWINISM AND IT'S A POSITION WHICH IS BEING INCREASINGLY HELD AS A SECULAR DOCTRINE. COMPARABLE, COMPARABLE TO THE BOOK OF GENESIS. MARK: IS HE RIGHT? I HAVE A LOT OF DOUBTS, I HAVE A LOT OF DOUBTS AND SO DO OTHER PEOPLE. THERE ARE MANY, MANY PLACES WHEN ONE LOOKS AT DARWINISM, SOME SAYS LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE SCIENTIFIC THEORY, IT'S A COLLECTION OF ANECDOTES. WHY DID THE GIRAFFE DEVELOP SUCH A LONG NECK? WELL, HE WANTED TO REACH THE TREES ON THE TOP. WELL HOW COME OTHER ANIMALS DIDN'T DEVELOP THE LONG NECK? THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REACH THE TREES ON THE TOP. HOW COME CERTAIN TYPE OF EUROPEAN EELS HAVE TO SWIM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN ORDER TO MATE? OTHERS ARE HAPPY FORNICATING CLOSE TO HOME. IT WORKED FOR ONE SEAL, NOT THE OTHER. WHY AREN'T WOMEN BORN WITH TAILS LIKE CATS? WELL, WOMEN DON'T SEEM TO NEED THE TAILS, THOUGH IT COULD MAKE THEM MORE ALLURING THAN THEY ARE. WHY DON'T CATS RULE THE WORLD, CONSIDERING THEY HAVE EVERY REASON AND EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO? WELL, THEY'RE CONTENT BEING OUR DOMESTIC MASTERS. THE ANECDOTES PILE ON INTERMINABLY AND NO FUNDAMENTAL LEADING PRINCIPLE. MARK: DO YOU FIND THAT MOST ATHEISTS, MORE PROMINENT ATHEISTS EMBRACE DARWINISM. EVERY LAST ONE. MARK: WHY DO THEY DO THAT? BECAUSE IT'S A SECULAR MYTH. EVEN ATHEISTS NEED COMPELLING MYTH HOW WE GOT HERE, WHAT WE DO HERE, WHAT OUR PURPOSE IS. HOW WE GOT HERE IS AN ACCIDENT. WHAT WE GOT HERE? WE HAVE NO IDEA. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE, FORNICATION AND REPLICATION, THAT'S ABOUT IT, IT'S A VERY, VERY VIABLE MYTH. PEOPLE ACT ACCORDING TO IT. MARK: AND IT ALSO DOESN'T
