there are things you just don't say on Egyptian television these days but oh shut off the tower t0 Animalia mind and if you lumber or even on a channel based outside the country and broadcasting in like Al Jazeera Mubasher and Abdul Mon aim a bowl food - must have known that he was across what is considered the red line in Egypt because he questioned the relation between the Egyptian army and President Abdel Fattah al-sisi he insinuated in the interview that relationship between the army and President Sisi may not be as solid as assumed an obelisk area was really shut off I could not speak for him but I can speak in terms of any voice of opposition to the regime featuring on al Jazeera Channel and projecting a view that is contrary to that of anything this little regime is not even going to allow any semblance however cosmetic of opposition to it it's a sign that it feels threatened a regime that feels itself marginalized and widely opposed contrary to the image it wants to project of itself of being popular and representative which is exactly what happened to Abdullah named a bull four to three days after that interview having returned to Cairo from London he was jailed along with six members of his political party for two was a leading figure in the Muslim Brotherhood before splitting from the movement to run as an independent candidate in the 2012 election that Mohamed Morsi and the Brotherhood would go on to win of the tens of thousands of Egyptians jailed since president el-sisi took power from Morsi in 2013 for two is among the most prominent when he agreed to talk to Al Jazeera Mubasher the network knew it had a story on its hands it devoted one hour and 40 minutes to that interview Al Jazeera has been banned from Egypt since 2013 the authorities have jailed its journalists and accused the network of pro-muslim Brotherhood coverage on stories like this one the government and its allies refused any and all interview requests Al Jazeera is not the only outside broadcaster in the Egyptian mix the less tolerance the government shows for dissent on the domestic airwaves it seems the more news comes from beyond the country sports appearing on al Jazeera is provocative in the current Egyptian climate however I think the issue goes beyond Jazeera because now there are Egyptian media that are opening in Turkey that can only be understood through the geopolitical angle it is not about let's say Turkey or Qatar believing and the values of freedom of expression it is more about using media in geopolitical struggles with with other countries the rise of these channels came as some kind of countering the official state narrative by giving a different version of reality altogether a different story and they they've positioned themselves from day one as quote/unquote oppositional media families Brent alaikum - Luda Gary the istanbul-based and media channels are a vital lifeline for Egyptians who want to know what's happening there in a very important channel in putting forward and alternatives and in many ways much more balanced view of the reality a political economic and security reality in Egypt I just have you know a caveat they should not slide sometimes to the same level of propagandistic type of coverage ability Lezyne maybe Sharia law says some of the words we use or some of the insults that they used might backfire and it might affect their credibility negatively rather than positively in the eyes of a wide sector of Egyptians among the channels beaming out of Istanbul and into Egypt the two biggest are al shark and Mecca maligne of the to Mecca Moline is considered more pro-muslim Brotherhood our shark is owned by a former MP and party leader Ayman Nour who fled Egypt in 2013 Mecca moline's ownership structure is more opaque but its donors have clear links to the Brotherhood which makes the network an ultra sensitive issue in Egypt when it sells an international market research firm published a survey last year showing that Mecca Moline was the country's most watched television channel the authorities closed down the firms Cairo offices the official reason given concerns over health and safety in the workplace travel restrictions on Egyptian journalists have recently been widened to include Turkey again the Sisi government cited safety concerns calling Turkey a war zone which will come as breaking news to Turks and the Egyptian journalists working there why are they coming to Turkey the opposition whether it's politicians or journalists all need to breathe to have some fresh air schway politicians journalists citizens we're all suffocating in injured the media have only one thing a paper and a pen or a camera and they're considered enemies of the regime but the regime's media even with all its strength its dozens of channels and millions of dollars cannot stop freedom of speech the Egyptian media is controlled by the general intelligence services what we're seeing is increasing control by the military through its holdings of supposedly privately-owned and independent television channels and news outlets it under lines the fact that the military and military intelligence are going to control the narrative fully and totally this is complete authoritarianism and I think it's represented very clearly now in developments in the media sector having long since gained control of news outlets within Egypt banned channels they don't like and arrested journalists and politicians who refused to fall silent what is left for the authorities to do get some other voices celebrities to echo the dominant narrative film stars and footballers are among those who have been added to the nonstop chorus of Pro CC voices you will hear and see on the Egyptian errors belladonna is no less innocent there is this very very deep state of fragmentation and polarization and division like Egypt has never witnessed before and a narrative of you're either with us or against us so those who are already conditioned their minds already conditioned prostate pro-regime a pro CC they're going to definitely you know be affected by these types of endorsements these people are hand-picked and they are used to legitimize the dictatorship of general Sisi there will always be a minority of supporters for whatever reasons for dictatorial regimes but the vast number of people opposed to this regime do not have a voice and they certainly do not have a voice any kind of representative voice through the media in Egypt nom
