00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,900
from the sinking boats and when I saw

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,930
him it was from behind a fence and he

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,189
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing there grabbing at his</font>

26
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,229
throat because of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water that</font>

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,750
he'd swallowed and all the lives that

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,689
has been fed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are slowly choking him</font>

29
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,820
from the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a sense an innocent</font>

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,710

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,750
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's trying to listen as he stands</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">much is missing his firstborn child for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't actually come across our seas</font>

37
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,729
because our mottos aren't quite fair

38
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,430
I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> people tying knots in their</font>

move or to be moved or to feel emotion

47
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,409
I've a notion that politicking is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

51
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,150
we were blessed with being born on

52
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,150
different soil blessed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lack of</font>

53

the controversial but<font color="#E5E5E5"> history tends to</font>

60
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,180
repeat itself so it's no wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

white<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here are scared because</font>

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
last time someone came here looking for

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,020
a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> life that was us and we stole</font>

64
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,790
and massacred from the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

65
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:52,430
land so maybe when we see asylum seekers

66
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,750
seeking peace we see a little of

67
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,540
ourselves reflected there that same fear

68
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,220
and desperation we feel when we're late

69
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">for class or misplace the keys to one of</font>

our four cars that's the same fear

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,890
instilled in them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> their father</font>

72
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">was just murdered by the Taliban or</font>

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,800
they're choking at sea or they're

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,540
choking on air behind an electric wire

75

fence praising their foreign than

he sends<font color="#CCCCCC"> me letters from detention where</font>

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,709
he never fails<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention how maybe one</font>

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,510
day and aussie girl will fall in love

80
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a Tamil guy is that just so</font>

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,830
impossible for two<font color="#E5E5E5"> born beneath the same</font>

82
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,709
 sky and he tells himself it can

83
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,870
be true it must be two cultures

84
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">complementary cuz he he left his girl in</font>

85
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,630
Sri Lanka and he never wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see her</font>

86
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,190
again no thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he doesn't</font>

87
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,660
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know the woman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would emerge</font>

88
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,090
from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of trial her head</font>

89
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,580
submerged beneath seas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of policies and</font>

90
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,220
papers and laws and if she ever made it

91
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,920
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shore with peace of mind and he</font>

92
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,420
welcomed her to come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> share this</font>

93
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,400
peace of mind he couldn't bear the pain

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
of forcing her to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> to swim again</font>

95
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,410
freestyle arm over arm playing it by ear

96
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,540
hearing past the cries of babies who

97
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,489
cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here after 14 hours of</font>

98
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,269
treading water in five years behind bars

99
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,950
after all that he still thinks it's

100
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,870
amazing this country<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ours</font>

101
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,530

thank you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much that poems called</font>

103
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,410
choking on air<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was inspired by a</font>

104
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,210
true story of a guy I met<font color="#CCCCCC"> at villawood</font>

105
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Detention Center and the conversation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

106
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,710
had with him was really humbling because

107
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,410
i was there writing an article and so

108
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,910
the questions I was asking him were kind

109
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,320
of like Oh what was your journey like I

110
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,910
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe what happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me why</font>

111
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,040
you left Sri Lanka and the other side of

112
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,380
the conversation was him asking me like

113
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do you do on the weekend for fun</font>

114
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,260
and what kind of music do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to</font>

115
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,880
and it brought me straight back down to

116
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,710
earth when I realized in that moment

117
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he was a person pretty much the</font>

118
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,910
same as me<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wasn't an entity and he</font>

119
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,830
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a political idea he was a human</font>

120
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:11,720
being and he's since been released from

121
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,210
Villa woods which is really cool so my

122
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,040
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Lauren</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Reed I'm from Wollongong</font>

co-founded the Wollongong poetry slam

127
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,470
which is the last saturday of every

128
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,960
month if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ever done in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the area</font>

129
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,979
usually we catch the train up but

130
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,260
tonight my mom is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowd and she</font>

131
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">drove</font>

132
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,890
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a poem about mothers but I</font>

133
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,840
thought I'd dedicate the next one to<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

134
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,830
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she doesn't feel left out and the</font>

135
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,060
next thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys is</font>

136
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,030
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> church and I'm not a religious</font>

137
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,890
person but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i'm a bit of a</font>

138
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,720
spiritual person so this poem was kind

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,790
of thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the bumper</font>

140
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,460
sticker slogan god is<font color="#CCCCCC"> love sometimes on</font>

141
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,950
the back of cars<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was thinking about</font>

142
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in some of the more spiritual</font>

143
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,650
moments that I've experienced in my life

144
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:18,070
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> church if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is love then</font>

145
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,310
I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt love before I've never</font>

146
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,200
raised my eyes to the heavens or watched

147
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,070
my knees hit the floor my face rests at

148
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,600
the waist level of the devil but it's

149
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,340
kept out of trouble by<font color="#E5E5E5"> pitchfork and</font>

150
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,970
high-pitched treble apparently death

151
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,520
comes in three years belief prayer and

152
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,100
loyalty please God forgive<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for I know</font>

153
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,590
not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do most of us seem lost</font>

154
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,020
amongst the few cradling pages of a book

155
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,750

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,280
grains of what is true mixed with freeze

158
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,740
frames of mind games rendezvous and

159
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,600
bathroom floor tiles cracked into now

160
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
love love is a word I seldom use in

161
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,360
poetry because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cliche at least the</font>

162
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,950
version that is known to me and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

163
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,690
want to repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> my lack of wisdom like a</font>

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,669
rosary but a rose is a rose you know and

165
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:12,040
any other name would smell as sweet so

166
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,250
God or love push or shove worship the

167
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,169
lover as we hide beneath bed covers from

168
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,900
this God<font color="#E5E5E5"> lying above us the silver cross</font>

around his neck<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowers its chained in my</font>

170
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,220
chest because sometimes I confuse love

171
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,100
with something less and confuse God with

172
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,010
just a man dressed in a robe<font color="#E5E5E5"> barefoot</font>

173
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,020
into the bathroom he strode floor tiles

174
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,480
cracking beneath his toes book of Job

175
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,640
and tap water splashing the crown<font color="#CCCCCC"> of his</font>

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that splintered glimmer of</font>

and realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> love has always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

183
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,980
inside of me see I know

00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,170
the color purple in a field of green and

185
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,300
I feel the energy of the congregation as

186
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,270
they sing we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> solar's of people but</font>

187
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,850
controlling the people is like creating

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple and then suppressing the fall</font>

189

the curl of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> toes where honesty and</font>

loving shows and a sleeve worth

scrubbing clean of emotion once warm

195
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,630
there but worn down now by cautious care

196
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,000
love growing between sheets of paper and

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,650
cotton caught up in that tangle of

198
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,740
pillow talk and prayer and on the

199
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,990
seventh day I was caught unaware by the

room service<font color="#E5E5E5"> ladies food tree vulnerable</font>

201
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,729
and malleable my thoughts were like soft

202
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,559
clay and his arms were out envelop

203
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,909
impale raised at the railing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

my wrists to her guilty call it a sin

207
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,430
it's suicide cut my clay with fishing

two words two ideologies two birds with

one stone and if both of them fly away

we've all been shown instead they press

219
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,270
we've got to leave to be on time

220
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,050
the first time I ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard a spoken</font>

221
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,880
word poem I was studying in the united

states where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty big spoken word</font>

223
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,620
poetry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was studying with this</font>

224
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,720
lecturer who said guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to let</font>

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go early from class today i'm going</font>

226
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,060

227
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,520
go and see this film so our lecturer

228
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,260
paid for our whole class to see a film

229
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,000
he went off back home to<font color="#CCCCCC"> his family and</font>

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,580
the film was louder than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bomb and it's</font>

231
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">about youth slam in Chicago it follows</font>

232
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,680
the story of four teenagers who write

233
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking amazing poetry and that</font>

234
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,750
was a first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ahead slam I sending in</font>

235
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,760
the cinema bawling my eyes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i</font>

236
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
love that such a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing like a film</font>

237
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,630
can change someone's life path so

238
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,220
drastically and that is what I love

239
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">about things like bankstown</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> poetry slam</font>

240
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring in all these different</font>

241
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,000
members of the community together

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,100
because I know that one single line from

243
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,960
one single poem can change someone's

244
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,310
whole direction in life whether it's

245
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,110
only by one small tiny degree of

246
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,530
difference so they saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> body builder I</font>

247
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,070
thought I'd do a poem about my time in

248
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,530
America so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have this really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short one</font>

249
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,050
it's a sonnet which means it has i think

250
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 lines I mean I'm not to glue on</font>

251
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,360
the specifics but um it's called Harlem

252
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,010
shakes because when i was in new<font color="#E5E5E5"> york</font>

253
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,480
city I lived there for about four weeks

254
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,810
at all up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stayed in Harlem some</font>

255
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,280
people reckon that's like the dodgy area

256
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,450
of New York City<font color="#CCCCCC"> where I had a lot of</font>

257
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,030
fun there so the sonnet Harlem shakes

258
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,260
the hostels were cheaper in Harlem with

259
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">card boarded windows and cereal bowls I</font>

260
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,840
was told to fold into the arms of Harlem

261
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,520
where food<font color="#E5E5E5"> stamp signs stuck to shop</font>

262
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,880
fronts frosted over with cold my bed was

263
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">a tattered mattress on the floor and</font>

264
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,050
dinner was with extra hot sauce the lost

265
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,940
remnants of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> renaissance that the</font>

266
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,950
chicken wings guy left in a takeaway box

267
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,060
outside my door<font color="#E5E5E5"> now door never once</font>

268
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,100
opened with his key but the passwords to

269
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,440
pass through Harlem flowed through me as

270
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,870
a polo kicked up this storm after a calm

271
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,420
and said words words are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the baseline</font>

272
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,300
rhythm of second Avenue in 116 and that

273
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">explains</font>

274
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,079
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spanish hymns that have started</font>

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,220
in my tongue and when words are all I

307

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:27,980
stitches in my lips to come undone we

about how amazing sand is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stick in</font>

312
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,030
our cold feet into hot water faces

313
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,460
candid and so close but only our

314
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,200
kneecaps would touch and that was enough

315
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,730
now I fall in love<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people I don't</font>

316
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,090
know on trends that are usually

<font color="#CCCCCC">traveling in the opposite way my lips</font>

318
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,850
are cracked like the pavement like

<font color="#E5E5E5">pepper like parched earth parting to</font>

trap unwary prisoners my cheeks are

321
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,850
aching and my eyes are dry trying to

322
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,960
keep up appearances that day I<font color="#E5E5E5"> cursed</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">myself saying I'd never love again and</font>

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,640
then split<font color="#E5E5E5"> my heart into infinitive</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for someone with some sticky tape and a</font>

fossicking pan to sift through my

memories and pick out the ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

hidden and to understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't</font>

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,770
cracked in 4 x 365 days so please

<font color="#E5E5E5">forgive me if i do now i loved how you</font>

333
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,590
were brave brave enough to hold out your

334
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,440
hand to me unsure if I could take it all

335
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the forced smiles and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn to styles</font>

336
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,190
hiding kisses and abstaining but I did

337
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,720
and when our fingers locked your thumb

338
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,040
always went over the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

339
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,890
otherwise I felt weird I kept every

340
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,560
single movie ticket stub and then I

341
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,390
swapped them all for a plane ticket love

342
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,310
I thought was smaller than a wingspan

343
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,590
thought I could outrun it because I can

344
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,800
sprint faster than<font color="#E5E5E5"> most boys can and so</font>

345
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,810
I ran to Brazil the land of romance I

346
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,430
promised myself to keep still<font color="#E5E5E5"> and wait</font>

for a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 *</font>

look in the new because you're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

350
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,839
person I'd ever lain with and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font>

351
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,490
to prove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was lainla sand that I</font>

352
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,439
didn't need you so Jeff with his

353
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:14,329
washboard chest serenaded me and made me

354
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,680
feel something again for a week or two

355
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,509
but he didn't have an alcove in his

356
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">shoulder blade carved in the shape of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

forehead where we fit together like the

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,749
hinges on a folded chessboard and pawns

359
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,110
were sent to die for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our love and people</font>

360
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,449
played trumpets in the street and cover

361
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:34,069
that same refrain mixed with catch a

362
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:35,869
second liquor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that circled around again</font>

363
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,759
Lee the gain returning to the same story

364
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,579
that same day you started smoking

365
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:43,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">cigarettes spinning ash what the hell</font>

366
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,319
was that about staying in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> words that</font>

367
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,519
came out of your mouth a different

00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,990
pigment I didn't know you anymore and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

369
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,220
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wash clean of it so I stand in</font>

370
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,850
showers waiting for poems to come while

371
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,649
masturbating I'm waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with bated</font>

372
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:58,850
breath for someone has saved me from

373
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,319
this mess I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that I'm an</font>

independent woman blessed to stand on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a damsel in distress but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I never</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">said it was painless it rains less on</font>

378
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,350
this side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last four years but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

379
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,089
still feel fear dripping from the deep

380
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,459
and increases that corner my eyes nearly

381
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,740
70 kilograms worth of me trembles at the

382
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,240
thought that I've pulled the short straw

383
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,279
that other men will only ever i mean my

384
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,499
cellulite thighs and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i smile</font>

385
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,809
cuz i'm trying to hide behind words that

386
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:34,399
rhyme<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

387
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,199
besides the seconds of time that have

388
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,870
passed by and I'm ashamed<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

389
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,850
despite every bomb<font color="#CCCCCC"> blast war or</font>

390
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,559
injustice it's just this feeling I've

391
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,749
claimed love I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's certain to</font>

392
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:48,019
make me cry you had a rope swing in your

393
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,290
backyard tied to a trunk up high that

394
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,089
swung out across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stream and stringy</font>

395
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,129
bark trees to freedom and then swung

396
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:56,959
back into your arms every single damn

397
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,829
time once you asked me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kiss you when</font>

398
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:03,259
she was in the room and I turned my head

399
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,779
embarrassed like a blind<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye to receive</font>

400
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:11,569
my abandonment on cue but you were right

401
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,740
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and I'm forgetful</font>

402
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">and forgiving I swear</font>

403
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,549
despite this poem I care about your

404
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:24,919
suspended truths like in cartoons the

405
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,659
Coyotes gone and flipped on my road

406
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:30,110
signs but it's ok this time when I run

407
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,700
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge of the cliff instead of</font>

408
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,789
trying to stay and scramble I'll take my

409
00:17:34,789 --> 00:00:00,000
leave I'm coming clean
