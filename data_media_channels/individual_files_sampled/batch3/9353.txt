GIULIANI TOLD FOX NEWS A SHORT TIME AGO, QUOTE THIS CASE IS ESSENTIALLY OVER. THEY ARE JUST IN DENIAL." WHILE THE PRESIDENT APPEARS TO BE CONSUMED ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, HE HAS MORE PRESSING MATTERS AT HAND, SUCH AS WHETHER HIS SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN IS ON, OR OFF. Reporter: MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF HIS PAKISTAN TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS UNCLEAR ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN. President Trump: WE WILL HAVE TO SEE. Reporter: NORTH KOREA PULLED OUT OF MEETINGS WITH SOUTH KOREA, PROTESTING MILITARY EXERCISES. PYONGYANG ALSO LEFT OPEN TO QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA MEETING WOULD BE SCUTTLED. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS THINK IT ALL MIGHT BE SO MUCH NORTH KOREAN BLUSTER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FULLY EXPECTED. THE PRESIDENT IS VERY USED TWO AND READY FOR TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS, AND IF THEY WANT TO MEET, WE WILL BE READY. IF THEY DON'T, THAT'S OKAY, ALSO. WE WILL CONTINUE WITH A CAMPAIGN OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE IF THAT'S THE CASE, BUT IF THEY WANT TO MEET THE PRESIDENT THEN WE WILL CERTAINLY BE READY. Reporter: WHILE MILITARY EXERCISE WERE THE INITIAL RATIONALE FOR ITS TANTRUM, NORTH KOREA MADE CLEAR THAT ITS ISSUE WITH JOHN BOLTON TOLD FOX'S CHRIS BOLTON ON THE NINTH. BOLTON SAYS THERE IS ALREADY A MODEL FOR WHAT NORTH KOREAN DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD LOOK LIKE. WE HAVE VERY MUCH IN MIND OF THE LIBYA MODEL FROM 2003-2004. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES. THE LIBYAN PROGRAM WAS MUCH SMALLER BUT THAT WAS BASICALLY THE AGREEMENT THAT WE MADE IT. SO WE WILL WANT TO TEST NORTH KOREA IN THIS FIRST MEETING FOR EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE MADE THAT STRATEGIC DECISION. Reporter: 'S SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WALKED THAT BACK INSISTING ANY DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD COME FROM THE PRESIDENT, AND THAT HE HAS HIS OWN IDEAS. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THAT AS A SPECIFIC THING. I KNOW THAT COMMENT WAS MADE BUT THERE IS NOT A COOKIE-CUTTER MODEL ON HOW THIS WORKS. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT TRUMP MODEL, HE WILL RUN THIS THE WAY HE SEES FIT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU ARE AWARE THAT HE IS THE BEST NEGOTIATOR. Reporter: WE ALSO GOT SENT ME AN INSIGHT ON WHY RUDY GIULIANI DROPPED A BOMBSHELL ON THE SECOND THAT HE REIMBURSED MICHAEL COHEN FOR THE PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS. AND IN A REPORT RELEASED BY THE OFFICE OF ETHICS, PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTS THAT IN 2016, EXPENSES WERE RETURNED BY ONE OF DONALD J. TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS, MICHAEL COHEN. MR. COHEN SOUGHT REIMBURSEMENT OF THOSE EXPENSES AND HE WAS REIMBURSED IN 2017. THE PRESIDENT CONTENDS HE WAS NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT THE REIMBURSEMENT, BUT DID SO IN THE INTEREST OF TRANSPARENCY. OGE DISAGREED AND A COMMENT SAYING, IT CONCLUDED THAT THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PAYMENT MADE BY MR. COHEN WAS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED. OGE ADDED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW MET THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T THE PRESIDENT BEFORE THE PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS AND REIMBURSEMENT TO COHEN LAST YEAR? IN MARCH, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBILITY AND ETHICS IN WASHINGTON FILED SUIT FOR THE DOA AND OGE WANTING TO KNOW IF HIS FAILURE TO REPORT THE JUNE 17 DISCLOSURE WAS KNOWING AND WILLFUL. THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS SENT THE REPORT AND ACCOMPANYING LETTER TO ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION, OR AT LEAST FURTHER CONSIDERATION, AS TO WHY GIULIANI MADE THAT STATEMENT TO SEAN HANNITY BACK ON MAY 2ND. SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS THAT HE WAS AWARE THAT THE PAYMENTS WOULD COME OUT OF THE PRESIDENT'S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND WANTED TO GET AHEAD OF IT. BY GETTING AHEAD OF IT, BRET, IT WOULD BE GIULIANI THAT TOOK THE HIT AND NOT THE PRESIDENT. Bret: WE HAVE RUDY GIULIANI ON THE LAURA INGRAHAM HAM SHOW TONIGHT AT 10:00 P.M. ROGER STONES SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR IN THE SHOW TODAY. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? HE ISSUED A SUBPOENA TO JASON SULLIVAN, HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF THE PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATE OF THE PRESIDENT IN 2016. HIS SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR. WE CONTACTED SULLIVAN AND HE CONFIRMED THAT HE DID INDEED RECEIVE A SUBPOENA BUT WOULD GO MUCH BEYOND THAT. THIS IS AN INDICATION, BRET, THAT MUELLER MAY BE LOOKING INTO ANY EVIDENCE THAT ROGER STONE KNEW WHAT WIKILEAKS WAS UP TO WHEN IT WAS RELEASING ALL OF THOSE CLINTON EMAILS THAT EXTENSIVELY, AT LEAST ALLEGEDLY, HAD BEEN HACKED BY RUSSIA.
