who the heck does not love actor Rob Lowe I liked his acting and I think he's funny not to mention very very good-looking but he's also been married to his first wife and only wife Cheryl since 1991 and he's one of the more reasonable celebrities in Hollywood he's also not afraid to call out his fellow celebs remember my video from a few months ago we had deadly mudslides here in California and actress Bella Thorne tweeted complaining about the resulting traffic and Rob Lowe tweeted back at her this attitude is why people hate celebrity / Hollywood Bella I'm sorry you were inconvenience we will try to move out our dead quicker burn also when the Roseanne reboot aired and the ratings were sky-high Rob tweeted this the secret to Roseanne's massive ratings is that it celebrates people with huge political differences who are able to laugh and love together as they passionately disagree so he gets it now who knows who he voted for but at least he's not one of these hysterical frothing at the mouth Lib nuts but for that he is in deep deep trouble because you know in Hollywood if you are anything other than hateful and incredulous ly disgusted by this administration than you are the enemy shame shame shame but Rob Lowe did a one-man show in Washington DC last week and invited current White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer no it wasn't for no reason Rob Lowe's character on the wildly popular and long-running show West Wing he was the press secretary it's not because he has some fawning love for Trump administration press Secretary's so he invited them and Sarah Sanders posted a picture with him on Twitter and you can imagine what happens next let's just let's just scroll through some of the tweets at Tom well board tweeted at Rob Lowe what the f is wrong with you at Drew Brees by the way not the real Drew Brees tweeted just another reminder that Rob Lowe is still a POS and Greg bitter six tweeted did you let him hit it classy also again he's been married to the same woman for almost 30 years and Sarah Sanders is married as well but you know what I keep thinking I hate that people like Rob Lowe moderate reasonable people have to go through things like this but I feel like when they experience this they see the true nature of the left and many of their colleagues and there's some part of me that thinks that maybe it's moving them a little bit in our direction hey it happened with Dave Rubin right we can always hope you never know thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and opinions we've got an unlimited supply of them here at the rebels so subscribe to our premium content at www.stanford.edu 8 you will have easy and instant access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
