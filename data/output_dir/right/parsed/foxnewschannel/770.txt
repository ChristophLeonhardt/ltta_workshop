>> WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT
IT IS THAT IT IS SUCH A
REMARKABLE, HISTORICAL
REVERSAL BECAUSE WE IN THE
LAST 30 YEARS HAVE BECOME
ACCUSTOMED TO BEING ON THE
SIDE OF SUPPORTING A
GOVERNMENT AGAINST AN
INSURGENCY IN VIETNAM AND IN
OTHER PLACES.
IT'S OUR BELIEF IN WARS OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION AND THEY
HAPPEN TO BE WARS OF
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE FIGHTING
COMMUNIST REGIMES.
IT'S NOT JUST A RANDOM
SERIES OF POLICIES
SUPPORTING INSURGENCY HERE
AND INSURGENCY THERE.
I THINK IT AMOUNTS TO A VERY
SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN OUR
HISTORY OF CONTAINMENT.
>> Bret: DR. CHARLES
KRAUTHAMMER IN 1986 TALKING
ABOUT THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, A
TERM HE COINED.
WE'RE BACK WITH OUR PANEL
FOR SOME REFLECTIONS,
STORIES, PANEL TIME.
FRED, MORT, MARA, YOU SPENT
A LOT OF TIME WITH CHARLES
ON THE PANEL:  BYRON YOU
HAVE AS WELL.
>> HE WAS A WONDERFUL GUY.
IT WAS GREAT TO WATCH HIM
BECOME A REAL CONSERVATIVE.
YOU KNOW, STARTING OUT WITH
THE WHOLE REAGAN DOCTRINE,
WHICH I'M SURE -- WELL, WE
KNOW THAT REAGAN WAS GLAD TO
HEAR ABOUT IT THAT HE HAD
REALLY CARVED OUT THIS
DOCTRINE.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT REAGAN AND CHARLES
TOGETHER, YOU THINK ABOUT
THE MOST CONSERVATIVE
POLITICAL LEADER IN AMERICA,
THAT'S REAGAN.
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT AND
INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL
INTELLECTUAL AS WELL.
BOTH OF THEM, FORMER
DEMOCRATS, FORMER LIBERALS
BECOMING CONSERVATIVES AND
THEY -- IT WAS A POWERFUL
FORCE.
BOTH OF THEM.
NOT JUST REAGAN.
BUT CHARLES AS WELL.
AND THEY WERE THE FORCE IN
AMERICAN POLITICS FOR 25
YEARS.
>> Bret: YOU KNOW, MORT, YOU
WORKED WITH HIM NOT ONLY AS
A PANELIST HERE BUT BEFORE
THAT AT THE NEW REPUBLIC.
GEORGE WILL WROTE.
THIS HE SAID SOME PEOPLE ARE
SUCH A LARGE PRESENCE WHILE
LIVING THAT THEY STILL
OCCUPY SPACE EVEN WHEN
THEY'RE GONE.
MORT?
>> WE WERE FRIENDS FOR 40
YEARS.
AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW,
LOSING A DEAR FRIEND OF US
ALL, WE HAVE REALLY LOST A
NATIONAL TREASURE.
I MEAN, HE WAS THE MOST
BRILLIANT COMMENTATOR OF OUR
TIME.
I THINK HE IS UP THERE WITH
WALTER LITTMAN AND DOROTHY
THOMPSON AND BILL BUCKLEY
AND MAYBE EVEN GEORGE
ORWELL.
HE USED TO JOKE THAT HIS
TRAINING AS A PSYCHIATRIST
WAS GOOD PREPARATION FOR
COVERING AMERICAN POLITICS,
WHICH IS GETTING CRAZIER AND
MORE TOXIC BY THE DAY.
HE IS THE ONE WHO COINSD
BUSH DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.
YOU KNOW, THE TENDENCY OF
LIBERALS TO NOT GIVE GEORGE
W. BUSH CREDIT FOR ANYTHING.
AND I THINK HE GOT DONALD
TRUMP JUST RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, GOVERNED BY ID.
RECKLESS.
WORSE THAN NARCISSIST.
IN ONE OF HIS LAST COLUMNS,
I THINK HE
OVEROPTIMISTICALLY SAID THAT
THE GUARDRAILS OF AMERICAN
DEMOCRACY ARE HOLDING
BECAUSE THE BOYCOTTS AND
POLICE CHIEFS REPUDIATED
WHAT TRUMP SAID AND THE
SENATE WOULDN'T CANCEL
OBAMACARE AND WOULDN'T LET
HIM FIRE JEFF SESSIONS.
I THINK IT WAS OVERLY
OPTIMISTIC.
IN FACT, BECAUSE CHARLES WAS
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL
CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST, THE
ONE CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST
THAT ALL CONSERVATIVES
LISTENED TO, I THINK HE WAS
ONE OF THE GUARDRAILS OF
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND NOW
HE IS GONE.
I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE
WEEPING.
>> Bret: YOU KNOW, MORT, AND
MARA, TO YOU, HE, CHARLES,
OBVIOUSLY WAS VERY CRITICAL
OF CANDIDATE TRUMP.
BUT AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP
WON THE ELECTION, CHARLES
REFLECTED A LOT ABOUT WHAT
HE SAID EARLY ON.
AND HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE
WAS SEEING AND HOW IT HAD
EVOLVED.
HERE IS AN INTERACTION HE
HAD WITH TUCKER AFTER A
RALLY IN WEST VIRGINIA BY
TRUMP.
>> IS
>> TS
>> THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE.
FORGET ABOUT THE NUMBERS.
FORGET ABOUT THE CHATTER IN
WASHINGTON.
FORGET ABOUT THE STORIES
ABOUT RUSSIA WHICH HE SPENT
A LOT OF TIME ON.
BUT I REPRESENT A HUGE
CONSTITUENCY OF TREMENDOUS
SUPPORT AND ENTHUSIASM.
HE WASN'T VERY SPECIFIC ON
POLICY BUT HE SAID I'M
BRINGING YOU GUYS BACK.
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO
LISTENED.
YOU WERE ABANDONED.
THAT'S HIS APPEAL.
THAT'S HOW HE WON THE
ELECTION AND HE IS REMINDING
THE ELITES THAT THAT APPEAL
IS STILL THERE.
>> Bret: MARA?
>> LOOK, CHARLES WAS A
CONSERVATIVE INTELLECTUAL.
AND HE LOOKED AT THINGS THE
WAY THEY WERE.
HE WASN'T A KNEE JERK
ANYTHING.
AND THERE WAS NOTHING
POST-TRUTH ABOUT CHARLES.
IF TRUMP DID SOMETHING
RIGHT, HE PRAISED HIM FOR IT
HE WASN'T A REFLEXIVE, NEVER
TRUMPER.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S
SO GREAT THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO KEEP ON PLAYING THESE
CLIPS OF HIM, EVEN FROM
BEYOND THE GRAVE, BECAUSE HE
HAD SO MUCH TO SAY THAT IS
STILL GOING TO BE RELEVANT.
I THINK HIS PASSING IS SUCH
A LOSS FOR CONSERVATISM.
SUCH A LOSS FOR PUBLIC
DISCOURSE WHICH AS MORT JUST
SAID IS GETTING MORE TOXIC
AND TRIBAL AND UGLY BY THE
DAY.
CHARLES IS THE ANTIDOTE TO
ALL OF THAT.
I AM SO HONORED THAT I GOT
TO SIT NEXT TO HIM FOR ALL
THESE YEARS BECAUSE MY SEAT
WAS USUALLY RIGHT NEXT TO
CHARLES.
HE ALSO HAD AN INCREDIBLY
SWEET, SUNNY DISPOSITION.
I DON'T THINK I EVER SAW
CHARLES DARK OR ANGRY AT
ANYTHING.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY HE
WAS ABLE TO PERSEVERE
THROUGH ALL OF THE
INCREDIBLE OBSTACLES THAT
LIFE HANDED OUT TO HIM.
WHICH HE DID NOT DWELL ON
FOR A SECOND.
>> I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WITH CHARLES ESPECIALLY ON
THAT SPECIAL, HOURS OF
INTERVIEWS.
AND WANTED TO TALK TO HIM.
HE WAS RETICENT TO DO IT AT
GUESS.
HERE IT IS I'M ASKING HIM
ABOUT ANOTHER LOVE OF HIS,
NOT JUST BASIC BUT CHESS.
I WANT TO PLAY THE SOUND
BITE, BYRON.
>> WRITE ABOUT THIS PARIAH
CHESS CLUB, A WEEK OF GAMES
AT YOUR HOUSE.
DO YOU STILL PLAY?
>> NO, I GAVE IT UP.
IT'S AN ADDICTION.
>> Bret: COMPLETELY.
>> IT'S A POISON.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU REACH
A POINT WHEN YOU ARE ON THE
INTERNET, YOU KNOW, MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT AND YOU ARE
PLAYING SPEECH S OR YOU
REALIZE YOU ARE IN A MOTEL
ROOM AND YOU ARE DRINKING AL DRI
ROOM AND YOU ARE DRINKING AL DRK
ROOM AND YOU ARE DRINKING AL DRN
ROOM AND YOU ARE DRINKING AL DRG
AQUA VELVA.
>> FOR CHESS.
>> YOU CANCEL YOUR
SUBSCRIPTION AND DON'T DO IT
AGAIN.
YEAH, I HAVE BINGES.
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THIS HAS
HAPPENED TO ME EVER SINCE I
WAS ABOUT 20.
>> Bret: HE COULD CRACK ME
UP, BYRON.
IT WAS AMAZING.
>> TALK ABOUT A MIND THAT
WAS WORKING ALL THE TIME.
ONE THING DID I ON ALL OF
THESE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
SAID ABOUT CHARLES.
I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT
THE TRANSCRIPTS OF SOME OF
THE "SPECIAL REPORT" PANELS
HERE.
HE HAD AN INCREDIBLE GIFT IN
SPEAKING IN PERFECTLY FORMED
PARAGRAPH.
ONE PERFECT SENTENCE AFTER
ANOTHER WHILE THE REST OF US
STUMBLED OVER UHS AND AHSS
HE SPOKE IN SENTENCES THAT
COULD BE PUBLISHED AS IS
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS HE
WAS SO EFFECTIVE AS A
COMMUNICATOR.
>> Bret: HE WAS AN OP-ED ON
THE PANEL EVERY NIGHT.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK MORT
AND FRED.
WHEN WE COME BACK, A SPECIAL
