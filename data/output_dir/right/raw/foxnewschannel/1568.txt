1
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:18,005
TONY: AT HER ESTATE MIKE POMPEO

2
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:18,739
HITTING IRAN WITH THE STRONGEST

3
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,473
SANCTIONS IN HISTORY PLANNING A

4
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:25,479
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN IF IT DOESN'T

5
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:26,047
ABANDON NUCLEAR WORK.

6
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:26,847
ROB: EUROPE REASSURING IRAN IS

7
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:29,584
COMMITTED TO SALVAGING THE

8
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:33,754
NUCLEAR DEAL WITH OR WITHOUT THE

9
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:34,021
US.

10
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:34,755
WHY ARE OUR ALLIES SIDING WITH

11
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:35,389
THE COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS

12
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:37,692
FINANCIAL BACKING OF TERROR

13
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:38,859
ORGANIZATIONS?

14
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,795
HEATHER: HERE IS THE LEADER OF

15
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:48,803
THE BREXIT  MOVEMENT, NIGEL

16
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:49,136
FARAGE.

17
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:52,273
>> THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND

18
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:55,042
OTHERS MAKE THE DECISIONS FOR

19
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,846
THE EU.

20
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:00,915
THE BIG BANKS AND BIG BUSINESSES

21
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:04,352
ARE PREDOMINANT IN EVERYTHING WE

22
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:04,619
DO.

23
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,723
SINCE THE OBAMA DEAL A LOT OF

24
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:09,457
EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE INVESTED

25
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:10,124
IN IRAN AND THE REASON FOR

26
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:13,327
KEEPING VIDEOS TO PROTECT THE

27
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:16,397
INTERESTS OF COMPANIES WHO CARE

28
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:17,098
MORE ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINE

29
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:24,905
THAN THE SAFETY OF THE WORLD.

30
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:25,640
ALL OF THIS LEAVES THE UK IN A

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,173
DIFFICULT POSITION.

32
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:26,907
BORIS JOHNSON IS SIDING WITH THE

33
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:27,642
EUROPEAN UNION IN BRUSSELS AND

34
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:31,112
NOT AMERICA AND MANY WANT HIM TO

35
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:35,883
CHANGE HIS MIND.

36
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:36,584
ROB: HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THESE

37
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:36,951
SANCTIONS?

38
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:38,753
THE US IS ABLE TO PERMIT THE

39
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:41,455
STRONGEST SANCTIONS EVER ON

40
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:41,756
IRAN.

41
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:42,456
HOW EFFECTIVE WILL THAT BE IN

42
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:43,457
CHANGING THE COUNTRY WITH THE

43
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:46,961
EUROPEAN UNION DOING BUSINESS

44
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:47,461
WITH THIS COUNTRY?

45
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:52,700
>> IT WAS THE WAY TRUMP GOT

46
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,434
CHINA TO BE SERIOUS ON SANCTIONS

47
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:56,837
WITH NORTH KOREA, EFFECTIVELY A

48
00:01:56,837 --> 00:02:07,248
MAJOR REASON, TO THE NEGOTIATING

49
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:07,548
TABLE.

50
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:08,249
AND A LOT OF MONEY WILL COME

51
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:13,587
INTO YOUR COUNTRY.

52
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:14,322
THE EUROPEAN UNION, DIFFICULT TO

53
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:16,857
SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THE AMERICAN

54
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:17,558
POLICY CAN BE IF THESE PEOPLE

55
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:22,630
CONTINUE ON THEIR CURRENT

56
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,963
COURSE.

57
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:23,698
JILLIAN: IT IS NOT A PIPE DREAM

58
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:26,233
TO ASK THE URANIUM LEADERSHIP TO

59
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,437
BEHAVE LIKE A NORMAL RESPONSIBLE

60
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:29,770
COUNTRY.

61
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,575
DO YOU THINK IT IS SIMPLE?

62
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:38,846
>> I THINK TO RENEGOTIATE A BAD

63
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:43,351
DEAL IS A SENSIBLE, GROWN-UP

64
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:43,751
THING TO DO.

65
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:46,954
THIS IRAN HE AND REGIME HAS BEEN

66
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:53,461
IN POWER FOR 40 YEARS BY ISLAMIC

67
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,128
FUNDAMENTALISTS, FANATICS.

68
00:02:54,128 --> 00:03:03,371
AND IN LIBYA, OR IN A RACK,

69
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,105
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT DIMENSION

70
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:04,839
AND THAT IS WHY THE EU WERE TO

71
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,841
JOIN WITH AMERICA IN TOUGH

72
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:07,742
SANCTIONS ON IRAN THAT COULD

73
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:11,212
JUST LEAD TO PEOPLE BRINGING

74
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:12,513
DOWN THE ISLAMIC REGIME.

75
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:19,453
ROB: EMMANUEL MACRON CAME HERE

76
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:20,187
AND MET WITH THE PRESIDENT AND

77
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:20,921
SAID HE DOESN'T LIKE THE DEAL OR

78
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,423
THINK THE DEAL IS STRONG ENOUGH

79
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:25,359
BUT HIS CONCERN WAS WALKING AWAY

80
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:25,993
AT THIS POINT REDUCES OUR

81
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,963
CREDIBILITY IF WE WERE TO DO SO.

82
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,998
DO YOU THINK THE US LOST

83
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:31,665
CREDIBILITY IN A DEALMAKING

84
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:37,705
POSITION BY WALKING AWAY FROM A

85
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:38,005
DEAL?

86
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:38,339
>> KNOW.

87
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:38,939
IT IS CALLED DEMOCRACY.

88
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,277
OBAMA CHOSE TO PUT THE DEAL IN

89
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:43,577
PLACE.

90
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:44,311
HE STARTED IN GOOD FAITH, HOPING

91
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,012
IRAN WOULD BEHAVE THEMSELVES

92
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:49,316
ONCE THEIR ASSETS WERE FREE,

93
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,050
IRAN ACTUALLY THROUGH HEZBOLLAH,

94
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,623
HAMAS AND ITS ASSOCIATES AND

95
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:56,357
PROCESSES HAVE BEHAVED TERRIBLY.

96
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:57,091
THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE MADE A

97
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:03,397
DECISION, THEY VOTED FOR DONALD

98
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:04,098
TRUMP WHO SAID, THAT MAKES IT

99
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,200
LOOK LIKE A PROPER DEMOCRATIC

100
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,539
COUNTRY PREPARED TO GET THINGS

101
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:11,839
WRONG.

102
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:12,506
HEATHER: WE APPEAR GO WHEN

103
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:16,610
THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGE

104
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,144
HAPPENING SINCE THE

105
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:17,878
ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE, DO

106
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:19,613
YOU THINK A LOT OF ALLIES WILL

107
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:23,951
COME ON BOARD WITH CHANGES

108
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:24,418
INCLUDING THIS?

109
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,054
>> I WORRY ABOUT THE EUROPEAN

110
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:27,354
UNION.

111
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:30,858
IT IS VERY MUCH INFLUENCED BY

112
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:38,699
BIG BANKS AND BIG BUSINESSES.

113
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,400
MONEY TALKS IN THIS CITY AND

114
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,837
THERE IS ROOM HERE FOR US IN THE

115
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,706
UNITED KINGDOM TO REVISIT THIS

116
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:46,841
AND I VERY MUCH BELIEVE THE WAY

117
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:50,144
DONALD TRUMP COMES TO THE UNITED

118
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:55,449
KINGDOM JULY 13TH WITH THERESA

119
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:55,716
MAY.

120
00:04:55,716 --> 00:05:06,527
AND MAYBE MACRON AND OTHERS WILL

121
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:06,994
START TO THINK.

122
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:10,764
>> ON A LIGHTER NOTE YOU THROW A

123
00:05:10,764 --> 00:00:00,000
HECKUVA WEDDING.
