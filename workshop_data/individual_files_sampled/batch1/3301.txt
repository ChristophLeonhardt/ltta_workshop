so Tim Cook is what I call a quiet listener and when I interviewed at Apple somebody warned me Tim is extremely quiet don't let it unnerve you so Tim had asked me about what was the biggest mistake I made at Google and despite the warning I I didn't pay enough attention and I started maybe confessing because he was so quiet I started confessing a little bit more about this mistake that I really needed to be telling a perfect stranger in an interview and I realized all of a sudden that I was about to tell him something that that probably was gonna cost me a job and happily there was an earthquake right at that moment and apples apples headquarters is born on is built on these rollers and so the whole building was sort of swaying and I realized I had been saved by the bell and and I took the opportunity to say Tim tell me what's going on in this building and the engineer in him couldn't resist explaining to me about the the rollers and the way the way the building was built so I was very grateful to be saved by an earthquake
