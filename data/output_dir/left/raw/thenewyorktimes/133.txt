1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,630
What makes a 
carnivore smart?

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,015
For puzzle solving,
tooth and claw are just

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:08,715
not that important.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,220
Relative brain size
is the key.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,820
That’s how big the brain
is in relation to the body.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,070
Researchers at the
University of Wyoming

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,370
used metal puzzle boxes
to test 140 animals and

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,640
39 different species from
nine different families —

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,860
all carnivores.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,450
They recorded animals
in zoos trying to get

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,830
those boxes open to get 
at their favorite treat inside.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,470
Bears did the best.

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,530
The family that includes
raccoons and coatimundis

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,100
came in second —

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,820
no real surprise there.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,260
What was a surprise

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,370
was the poor performance
of animals that live

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,120
in complex social groups,

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,800
sometimes thought to
promote intelligence.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,640
Sadly, if you’re a fan
of ‘Meerkat Manor,’

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,730
the family that includes 
meerkats and

22
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,840
mongooses did the worst.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
Of course, when a poor
performer like a big cat

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,190
does well, 
that’s reason to cheer.

25
00:01:10,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Go tigers!
