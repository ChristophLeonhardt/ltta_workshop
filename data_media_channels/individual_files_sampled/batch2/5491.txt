they can make anything bad because they are the fake fake disgusting news anything I want they want to oppose you know I just figured out how to do the wall I'll say I don't want to build the wall and they'll insist on building it I just figured that out right now lather rinse repeat it is a time-tested strategy for Donald Trump bash the media and listen to the people cheer that is the basic formula part of a larger strategy if you can call it that and heading into the midterm elections but here's the question his throwing red meat at crowds in Pennsylvania and Beyond really going to persuade the voters the Republicans need to maintain control of Congress this November filip bump of the Washington Post wrote about the crowd last night at the rally one thing was very clear the people who were there were there to see Trump not the people the Trump was stunt stumping for it's certainly the case that there were more overt supporters of qyn on there than there were of Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner or Senate candidate Lou Barletta who was ostensibly the reason for Trump's visit one guy with a lose sticker didn't want to talk one woman with Scott Wagner should explain that it was her only political shirt and then she also called him Scott Walker Scott Walker she's former governor of Wisconsin he ran for president joining us now Democratic congressman Eric's wawel a member of the House Intelligence Sharing committees and at the table my friend the Reverend Al Sharpton president AI National Action Network and hosted politics nation here on MSNBC a regular Friday seen at this table great to see you rev congressman we almost always have you on this program and on this network talking about Russia and collusion and obstruction in judiciary and Intel stuff we're gonna ask you about politics today you're watching Donald Trump you're watching Donald Trump you given these speeches they're kind of always variations on the same theme with a little slightly different moving parts different stands is different at the same chorus and the same melody is this is it the way you win in the current climate that we're facing is this or is this the kind of thing with you're a Democrat you'll look at this and man I hope he keeps doing this all the way to November well I think he's missing what most people care about and he's the president likes to say no collusion no occlusion and John the truth is when it comes to health care or extending paychecks or making sure he cleans up Washington he certainly is not colluded with anyone to make that happen and I think that's what we should lead on and point out I was just in western Iowa for the last couple days with a candidate who's running against Steve King and he's getting hundreds of people in western Iowa a place where never competed before and I've seen that across the country and I think that's the energy that's gonna help us win this November for a little while congressman it looked like we could see in the polling earlier in the year we said blue a blue a blue wave and then it looked like things were tightening up in some of the generic ballots we're looking at some polling that looked like Republican had Republicans at least feeling a little bit more confident or learned not totally he does like they were totally doomed struck that has seems to have swung back in the opposite direction in these last few weeks Republicans and Democrats alike that I talked to on Capitol Hill all now are like bracing for the blue wave and trying to figure out how big it's going to be but not really denying that it's coming what is your sense of a confidence level in Democrats retaking control of the house and by it could it really be like a giant tsunami or is this gonna be a tight run thing we have the candidates for it to be a tsunami and I've met many of them about 60 of them are under the age of 40 their veterans small business owners doctors many women who have stepped up in 18 months ago never would have imagined that they'd be running for Congress but they see a wreckingball president and they're inspired to want to help their community and so I do think we are expanding the map as far as where we can compete but when I talk to them it's not about Trump one candidate said to me he said in my district Donald Trump is like smog we know it's there we breathe it we see it every day but that's not the focus the best thing we can do is focus on health care making sure that tax cuts help everyone and go in after the corruption so I think that's a winning message in each of these districts Rev I gotta ask you so I you know I'm wearing Joe this morning I got asked this question right at the top what do you think of Trump's rally I said man it's getting old this this this this room this one bit that he's doing started get a little tired and feel overly familiar is this really the kind of thing again it when the well out of the politican AMEX are against the Republican Party yeah this is gonna rev up the 35% of Donald Trump but is this the way that Al Lou Barletta wins Pennsylvania is this the way that an endangered Republican in a seat that we're at a district or Hillary Clinton won in 2016 is this the kind of message that motivates the voters they need well I don't think so I think first of all you've got to deal with the motive the two things he tries to discredit it all of these rallies is Mullah and the press because he's trying destabilize anything that comes out that may point to him being guilty of anything so he wants to really bury in everyone's psyche don't believe the press don't believe Muller so that's the motive that act though is wearing thin and you know I I said right after he was elected when I was a kid James Brown the singer used to help my youth civil rights work and James Brown told me the first time he took me to Las Vegas the difference between a lounge act and I act that goes in the main room he says you get attention in the lounge act you do silly things because you're competing with people drinking and people talking and paying you no mind but when you get on the main stage where you've got to perform because they pay $200 a seat at that time and they want to see a show he's a lounge act and after a while even the most intoxicated patron gets tired of the lounge act and goes to another act okay so here's what he should be saying it's August right he's got 4% growth he's got another good month of job of job creation unemployment's at 3.9 percent Republicans are facing headwinds going into November this should be a morning in America I'm delivering for you the economy is going well employment is humming and what is he doing he's yelling about the press and he's screaming about Russia it doesn't make political sense and it suggests use the lounge act comparison I would say it's like he's a pitcher he's in the majors he's got a fastball he needs to develop a curve and a slider and he doesn't have a curve in a slide makes political sense if the only thing he cares about is getting out of the Moller investigation and having the questions about Russia stop that's all he cares about and we can tell because the president has the bullhorn of going around and doing these rallies which every president has if we point back to Obama he pulled that out a couple of times to pass health care the stimulus those were clearly his number-one priorities when Trump uses the biggest megaphone that he has he does so for to protect himself from an investigation if he is trying to protect himself the fit he most needs to protect himself most from his impeachment and that would mean trying to do what he could to keep a Republican I got a stance
