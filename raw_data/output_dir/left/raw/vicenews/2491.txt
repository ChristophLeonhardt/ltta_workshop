00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">what did these reports claim was was</font>

wrong with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story they claimed that I</font>

250
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,930
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody perhaps inside</font>

251
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,940
Guantanamo is trying to discredit<font color="#E5E5E5"> you by</font>

him all the time

was just outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the perimeter all</font>
