environmentalists have filed a human rights complaint against Justin Trudeau over his alleged support of the Kinder Morgan pipeline I want to love this so much but I just think it's a bad idea to the environmentalists in British Columbia are worried and they want help the kind of help only the kangaroo court system of the Canadian Human Rights Commission can give them David I love an environmentalist who now resides in British Columbia has filed a human rights complaint let me read to you from his press release without laughing under Section 7 of the Human Rights Charter my and countless other concerned citizens rights have been violated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau he put Justine that's the best and the Liberal government of Canada and kinder morgan Canada limited have without concern for health security or psychological well-being of persons are a participant or complicit in the conduct threatening the right where the violation must be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the government's actions you see love is really angry at the government because a mean old pipeline is causing him great psychological distress anyway let's go on because the hyperbole coming up here registers on the Richter scale it is well known and accepted that this pipeline extension and the potential or likely economic and environmental disaster to British Columbia's coastal waters is unacceptable and a dangerous risk to the well-being of humanity these environmentalists have themselves twisted into knots whipped up into thinking that this twinning twinning of an existing pipeline is going to spell the end of humanity they really need to be mad at whoever is telling them these complete and utter fallacies because it is causing them a lot of undue mental distress it's not a human rights issue though let's be clear about that and then love goes on to elicit more people to bring forward vexatious human rights complaints and love attached the link to make it easier for people to do this and waste everybody's time and money it says readers who have been negatively affected by Justin Trudeau's decision to extend the Kinder Morgan pipeline can file complaints at the link now while I do think this complaint is completely ridiculous that an inanimate object a pipeline could violate your rights I think Justin Trudeau should pay close attention to this because I did a little research on this david eel of fellow who's bringing forward this complaint now and he won a human rights complaint and a monetary award against the Church of Scientology in Quebec in 2014 this guy knows exactly what he's doing here this whole thing is like watching the two craziest least self-aware people you know argue over who is the most reasonable between the two and I'm just standing here over on the same side of the street enjoying the show but I shouldn't be enjoying the show I really shouldn't the petty part of me cannot be more giddy above Justin Trudeau's radical environmentalist part of his base turning on him like a pack of hungry dirty jackals but the logical sick of this SJW garbage part of me is winning in the tug-of-war for good sense I mean are the environmentalists who are busy going around kicking police officers in the head really complaining about their security of person because of a pipeline is this where we're at and what exactly brought us here in the first place well in fact the very target of the human rights complaint Justin or Justin Trudeau is exactly what brought us to this strange place in November last year Justin Trudeau said that he would enshrine the right to adequate housing as a fundamental human right in Canadian law this is heavy on virtue signaling and really light on common sense but I believe that sort of the theme of this government isn't it what if you want to evict a tenant who is trashing your house and not paying you rent can you evict the squatter without violating his fundamental human right to adequate housing did anybody think of this and in August 2017 Justin Trudeau described reproductive rights which is just left-wing parlance for unfettered abortion access on demand as a fundamental human right and the Liberals have passed bill C 16 which made misgendering or not using someone else's preferred pronouns a human rights violation in Trudeau's Canada if I don't use whatever made-up pronoun you want me to to describe you I can be guilty of a human rights violation what I'm saying is here is this strange and reaching human rights complaint against Trudeau himself is exactly what Trudeau gets for calling everything that makes anyone feel uncomfortable a violation of their fundamental human rights now people from his own side of the political spectrum are weaponizing their hurt feelings and their discomfort as a tool against Trudeau it's a violation of their human rights now how do you like them apples Justine or Justin Justin Trudeau is causing a lot of people in this country great psychological distress a great many of those people are working in the oil patch they may even be pipe liners but being worried especially unreasonably the way these kooky environmentalists are is not a violation of your human rights it's life it's the human condition honestly I don't think anything will come of this human rights complaint and the free thinking free speech loving oil and gas advocating conservative in me sincerely hopes that nothing ever does but boy the mean girl and me is really going to enjoy the show while it lasts for the revolt media I'm Sheila Gunn read they have you downloaded the rebel media mobile app it's available on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store download it give it a whirl and take the other side of the story
