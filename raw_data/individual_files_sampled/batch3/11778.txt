the UN claims the situation in Yemen is catastrophic warning that up to 13 million people are facing starvation if the war doesn't end soon that figure represents almost half of the entire Yemeni population the UN has warned that we could see the worst famine in a hundred years with other aid agencies also raising the alarm the numbers are very hard to grapple with 13 million people on the brink of famine is one that should be compared to the entire population of countries there are almost 80 million people that are food insecure that means that 6 out of 10 Yemenis cannot feed themselves or feed their family parents don't know when they send their children to school whether they'll come home or whether the bombs will hit the school almost every aspect of the daily life has been affected by the conflict whether it's access to fuel clean water health facilities I met some children recently with open wounds on their legs that they can't afford to treat the population this is a crisis that is entirely man-made and could have been avoided and could indeed be avoided if we saw some serious action from parties to the conflict and the Allies in the saudi-led coalition including the US UK France Germany and others on Sunday an air raid had minibuses in the key Yemeni port of Adada killing at least 15 civilians and injuring 20 that's according to the UN Houthi fighters accused the saudi-led coalition of carrying out the attack the data has recently become the most violent frontline in the three-year long war in the country the Saudi government says it will investigate reports of civilian deaths an advocacy adviser on Yemen irzu's even vegan again told us that selling weapons to the warring parties is only worsening the crisis we are seeing a huge amount of duplicity from powerful countries countries like the UK in the u.s. are consistently throwing money at the problem of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen helping us reach people with food and water but meanwhile they're profiting from the sale of weapons that are perpetuating the war it seems to me that there are political interests at play that are overriding the interests of Yemeni people so our question to those powers is our jobs in the US and the UK more valuable than life in Yemen
