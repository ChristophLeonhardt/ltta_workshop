you may have heard I was invited to another event tonight the White House Correspondents Dinner but I'd much rather be in Washington Michigan than in Washington President Donald Trump drew cheers from supporters at this Michigan rally as he took swipes at everyone from the press to former US presidents Trump flew to Michigan snubbing hundreds of journalists and celebrities who turned out for the annual White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington last year he was the first president in nearly four decades to boycott the gala where comedians and correspondents trade barbs with the commander-in-chief as the press gathered for dinner and jokes about the president drum is the only person that still watches Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and things me although I'm not sure you'd get very far you keep it like the third question and you'd be like I have to phone a Fox and friend Trump stood before an audience of roughly 10,000 touting the success of his debt tough approach with North Korea interrupted by chance of Nobel Nobel from the audience think we'll have a meeting over the next three or four weeks there going to be a very important meeting the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of North Korea 20 early 90 minute speech was a chance for him to connect with his base mostly white middle class voters who continue to support his policies but it was also a missed opportunity to connect with the press and possibly show a sense of humor trend also an idea guy he's got loads of ideas you gotta love him for that he wants to give teachers guns and I support that because then they can sell them for things they need like supplies the president did send a surrogate his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stood in for Trump and for her she said it was an opportunity to interact with the press in a less contentious setting Diane Estabrook al Jazeera Washington
