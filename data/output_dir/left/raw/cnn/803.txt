1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:03,929
- [Narrator] On June 15th,
Billy Bob Thornton returns

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:05,657
to his Golden Globe winning role

3
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:08,779
in the new season of "Goliath".

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,241
He's a lawyer taking on another giant,

5
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:14,158
the criminal justice system itself.

6
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:16,909
Inspired by the shows themes,

7
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:20,279
we bring you the true
stories of three individuals,

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,862
each fighting for their own
cause against all the odds.

9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,947
- I started my environmental
activism when I was nine.

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,111
A lot of people in the
South, the Los Angeles area

11
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:36,975
that were around the oil facility,
were getting really sick.

12
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,776
And in my personal experience,
I had frequent nosebleeds,

13
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:41,568
frequent headaches, stomach pains.

14
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:43,855
I got to the point where I couldn't walk.

15
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:46,387
I definitely believe clean
air is a basic human right

16
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:47,687
and it's not fair that

17
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,706
because of your socio-economic status,

18
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:52,060
you don't have access to that.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,189
We sued the city of Los Angeles
for environmental racism

20
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,550
and a violation of CEQA,

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,131
the California Environmental Quality Act.

22
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:00,948
We won, they appealed.

23
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:01,988
We're still in court for that,

24
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:04,522
but that was definitely
a really big push for us

25
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,319
to make a change in the world.

26
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,030
- I have been speaking
up and advocating against

27
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,574
police gun violence and
state-sanctioned gun violence

28
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:14,122
since being a really young girl

29
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:17,038
and seeing unarmed black men being taken.

30
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:18,779
I'm a member of Women's March Youth,

31
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,067
which is the youth arm of the
National Women's March team,

32
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:24,299
and following the Parkland shooting,

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,245
we organized the March 14th walkouts.

34
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,531
We saw 2.7 million students walk out,

35
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,406
which makes it the largest student protest

36
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,687
since the Vietnam War.

37
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:36,363
- I wake up every day knowing
that I'm undocumented,

38
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,206
but also knowing that I've gotten so far,

39
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:42,501
so that gives me hope,
that gives me strength.

40
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,551
As an attorney, I don't want
to take no for my clients.

41
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,232
I wanna give them some hope.

42
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:49,179
I wanna give them a way to fight.

43
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:52,520
My client, Edith Espinal, is
one of my most extreme cases.

44
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,800
She lives in a church now.

45
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,319
She's fighting her deportation case,

46
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,869
so that she has a chance to fully explain

47
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,726
to the judge why she
fears returning to Mexico.

48
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:05,498
If there is any way to pass
any kind of immigration reform,

49
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:06,607
I would love to do that.

50
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,967
I would love to see that happen

51
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,068
in the next five years, 10 years.

52
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,458
Hopefully, we don't have to wait 25 years.

53
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,287
- The part that I put the most energy in,

54
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:18,319
is making sure my peers turn
out to vote this November,

55
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,576
because I really think
that that is the best way

56
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:23,867
for us to be heard and the
best way to see change.

57
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,418
- I definitely encourage everyone to do

58
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:28,524
what they believe is right.

59
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,156
It is very difficult and time-consuming,

60
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:33,489
but there's nothing like it.

61
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:35,895
- [Narrator] Tune into the news to see

62
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:38,247

63
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:40,685
continue to make a difference.

00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:44,254
