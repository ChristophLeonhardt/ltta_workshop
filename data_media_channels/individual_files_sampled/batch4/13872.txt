here's a story from American history that's almost a parable in 1898 the US government began funneling tens of thousands of dollars into a project to create a flying machine the project was run by Samuel Langley the prestigious Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and an expert in the field of astronomy and aviation on December 8th 1903 Langley's full-size piloted flying machine was brought out onto the Potomac River and launched from a gigantic floating catapult while the press and public looked on it went up and it went right back down again promptly crashed into the river and Langley was heartily heartily ridiculed in the press meanwhile same time out on a lonely stretch of land off North Carolina called Kitty Hawk two brothers from Ohio named Orville and Wilbur Wright we're getting ready to test their first flying machine they were an odd pair they never married they never even left home they ran a bicycle shop in Dayton to support themselves but they had become obsessed with the idea of human flight they took no money from the government and as for the experts when it occurred to them that all the greatest aviation experts who had gone before them were simply wrong in their calculations they scrapped the experts and ran practical experiments in their bike shop until they understood how to build a flying machine that could be controlled by the man onboard their first powered flight eight days after the Langley crash lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet which is about half the length of a 747 jet all the same and may have been the most profound advance in human civilization since Columbus stumbled on the new world just to add to this parable the story of the Wright's first flight one of the greatest news stories of the century was not broken by the mainstream media of the day the big papers either ignored the story or ran accounts so unfactual as to make no practical difference the guy who first told the true story of the Wrights was an odd little beekeeper named - Amos root who published a trade journal called gleanings in bee culture no kidding it was the early 20th century equivalent of a blog and it was rout who first told the world what the rights had accomplished even so when the brothers attempted to sell their invention to the US government a few years later they got a form rejection slip and had to go overseas to look for buyers and now it's easy to draw morale hear about the unwieldy incompetence of government and the dishonest gormless nosov the mainstream media but my question is this how did government in the media get to the point where stagnant lack of imagination Rises off them like a kind of swamp gas and how can we avoid sinking into that kind of chronic stupidity also how much can we laugh at them before we hurt ourselves trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right hurry Rob Michiyo Kaku is here he is written this just a fascinating book all the future of humanity

this is going to be an exciting show to just see whether I can get to the end of it so I have to address this drug headline Georgia this big red headline with a siren and everything that drug that Trump is announced he's running in 2020 who didn't think he was running in 2020 I think he's just doing this because he knows it will spread panic through the Democrats and they'll start fighting him now wasting their energy in their time fighting a reelection campaign that they could wait for while he's basically transforming the government into what it used to look like in 1776 but the thing I wanted to call this show stupid and how not to be it that was what cuz because they they used to say that the debt remember this is the Democrats are the evil party and the Republicans are the stupid party the Democrats want to destroy the country and the joke was always that if the Democrats came along said we have this great plan it's gonna burn the country to the ground in 90 days the Republicans say hold on hold on 90 days is way too fast you know we want six months to burn the country to the ground the Republicans were stupid and they kind they were constantly getting played by the Democrats who were evil now it seems to me that the Democrats have managed to become both evil and stupid and if you don't believe I why is this happening well let me give you two quotes okay one is from Obama you remember Obama Mohammed was it Obama Okama Obama I think I can't remember now that his legacy is just a smoking pile of radioactive ash blowing away on the winds of history I gave his speech there's some kind of sporting gathering and MIT and Obama gave a speech that was supposed to be super-dee-duper secret right there was no transcripts out it was not supposed to be released they smuggled out of course some the audio you can never keep this stuff secret and the audio is not very good so let me just read you some of the stuff that he was talking about he's talking about social media and different ways of media and he has said this before but he said essentially we now have entirely different realities that are being created with not just different opinions but now different facts and this isn't just by the way Russian inspired BOTS and fake news this is Fox News versus the New York Times editorial page if you look at these different sources of information they do not describe the same thing in some cases they don't even talk about the same thing and so it is very difficult to figure out how democracy works over the long term in those circumstances and he starts talking about how basically the government needs to create a playing field you know the free market is good but not until you agree on the facts and and the thing about Barack Obama is when he makes a speech it's not just a speech he used to make speeches about dark money then the IRS started to slow-walk conservatives to try and silence them then he would you know he would make speeches about stuff we have to do and then basically his agents would do it in the in the bureaucracy when he is making a speech like this he is signaling that the laughs the Democrat Party has to start thinking about how to silence those people who disagree with him because when he talks about different reality he's talking about two things he's talking about cable news he says this in the speech talking about cable TV and he's talking about talk radio why because they disagree with him that's what he means by a different reality now listen to this another speech former ABC News anchorman Charles Gibson gave a speech at Princeton's alumni day on Saturday Nevel is only what he says we can have honest debate about the president's policies we can debate immigration policy monetary policy gun control health care policy but what are not up for debate are American ideals and institutions that have served the country well for almost two and a half century centuries and among the most important of those ideals is a free independent vigorous press charged with an oversight of government function so we can debate everything but we can't debate the press because there's only one reality I mean this is the same press that has become the corporate defenders of big government that's what they are and they so so what you got is you've got these guys who basically have been wrong footed by the spread of information and Obama is sending signals to Facebook and to Google telling them things says this in speech fix your algorithms so that basically the facts can't get out basically the people who disagree with us cannot get out and he says you know the free market is fine it's okay to make money but no no no no no don't mean so let's take a look at the reality okay let's take a look at what passes for reality all this week-long I'm not gonna get back into the guns because I said what I have to say yesterday which is basically that the left is creating a narrative about guns the story that the shooting that happened the Valentine's Day Massacre and in Florida had nothing to do it was not about guns it was about the incompetence of government was just like the Wright brothers story it was about the FBI and the local police not doing not answering the call you know the shooter himself called up the sheriff's department and said I think school school shooter and they said absolutely no reaction they did nothing that's the story there's no reason for us to be talking about gun control schools are now safer than they were in the 1990s shootings are down mass shootings are down but is just the narrative is being created so they don't care what they say and because they don't care what they say they can say anything and because they could say anything they say some of the stupidest stuff you have ever heard like I said I'm not gonna concentrate on guns just on stupidity but before we talk about stupidity let's talk about being smart which means talking about stamps.com because we love our post office they do great stuff but where do you want your post office you wanted the same place everything else is you want it in your computer

press talking about guns I I mean this is amazing stuff lawrence o'donnell is MSNBC right now i don't pick on MSNBC for being liberal because they're openly liberal that's fine but i do pick on them for being stupid because stupid it burns all right here is lawrence O'Donnell explaining you know Trump wants to arm some teachers and they keep repeat it's amazing amazing Trump keeps saying people who are adept with firearms will have some experience we will train them give a few teachers in every school a gun and that that will mean that a guy who goes in with a gun and they keep repeating it back to him you want to arm all the teachers you want to arm Miss Smith who's teaching one year old you know you just make this stuff up and they they just say it back to him he says no that's not what I want to do and they keep repeating it back to him but now lawrence O'Donnell let you know what before we get to Florence go Donald let's start with this other guy on CNN Tom Fuentes cuts 7 he explains that we can't arm the teachers because they're all girls and girls wear dresses so where will they put their guns listen one of the things that people don't talk about a lot of these school Sandy Hook at an all-female faculty from principle to teachers and for a woman where are you gonna hide that gun during the day you can't put it your desk drawer somebody might steal it you can't get to it you're not gonna have it in a safe in the principal's office you can't get to it on your person hiding it if you wear a dress if you were a skirt are you gonna have to wear a jacket every day with a belt and a holster the way a detective you know on duty would do it's it's not a real practical solution even for a variety of reasons those girls also also ladies you break your fingernails on the trigger and you get and the the you know gunpowder scuffs up and it ruins your mascara so you don't want to shoot a guy while you're welcome put your makeup on but not as bad as lawrence O'Donnell Lawrence O'Donnell comes and it explains that you can't go up against a guy with an ar-15 with a handgun because your bullets are slower slower listen 2,182 miles per hour that's how fast the bullets were moving when they came out of the barrel of that ar-15 and Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school last week mm 182 miles per hour 3,200 feet per second that's what those kids were trying to outrun 3,200 feet per second that's three times faster than the speed of a bullet leaving the barrel of a nine-millimeter handgun with a high-capacity magazine the ar-15 can fire maybe ninety or hundred bullets in a minute a concealable Hamm gun can fire maybe 15 bullets in a minute but President Trump said today that he believes if you put that concealable handgun in the hands of White House chief of staff John Kelly he could have stopped the shooter in Florida last week the hammering has gotten to Lawrence I think we can see now I think it's a bite now look no wait to be fair to be fair they did run tests with handgun CNN did run a test with a handgun and this is how slow the bullets are see if president trumpets in it you can dodge the bullets from a handgun that's the problem all right so so if teacher so teachers can't carry guns because they have skirts and you the the banned guns are too slow anyway how do how do you get to this point where you're saying such idiotic stuff the answer is simple you're not listening to anybody else you are surrounded by people who agree with you which is what Obama is calling for and what Gibson is calling for they are angry now that other voices and other opinions have come out and started to undermine what they think of as the fact so I've talked about this Wall Street Journal piece yesterday that actually made me so angry I wrote them a letter that that where they started saying you know women are staying home in Germany they're not going to work because they believe that they have to take care of their children that their children might need moms at home you know and they and they reported this as if this were a problem instead of maybe a good thing maybe it was a positive thing because they aren't they don't hear any conflicting voices you know Donald Trump said something really dopey yesterday too and they've been picking on him these he had this he had this really good thing where he actually just talked to the governor's and listened to people of different ideas about gun control and he actually listens to them while all they do is attack him but he did go out and he said this is cut number five where he said if he'd been there he was criticizing the Sheriff's Department because at least one maybe four of their deputies stood outside and didn't rush into the building and this is what he said you know I really believe you don't know until you test it but I think I really believe I'd run into even if I didn't have a weapon and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too because I know most of you but the way they performed was was really a disgrace so so that's not the stupidest that people talk like this and you know Trump he's not careful with his language not making an excuse for him is a dopey thing to say because nobody knows what he would do the point is that if you're a police officer that's your job if you're not the sort of person you know you know if you you don't call a poet to go into the building you call a cop and if you're not the sort of person who is going to go into building if you're not the sort of person who's going to confront a gunman with your gun don't join the police I mean that's that that's the way it is don't become a soldier if you don't want to fight in a war so the kind of is kind of stupidity you know here's a really interesting piece from the Weekly Standard this is this I just love this piece and it basically says everything that I'm trying to say 2007 Warren Buffett right the billionaire he took a 1 million dollar bet on an investment and he said this is his an investment he said over a 10-year period commencing on January 1st 2008 and ending on December 31st 2017 the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds when performance is measured on a basic basis net of fees costs and expenses so in other words the market the top performing stocks will outperform experts picking stocks so Tom shields of the protege partners took the bet and Buffett won hugely I write over a 10-year period the five hedge funds gained an average of two point nine six percent over the same period the S&P 500 gained an average of 8.5% a huge huge difference all right the difference was that the first of all the fees that the experts charged for picking the stocks obliterated some of the profits and they weren't worth the difference in the even the best experts picking the stocks so that was the best experts but the other thing was most of the experts almost all of the experts couldn't beat the market the market was smarter because the market is not an expert the market doesn't have an informed set of opinions that solidify over time and are impervious to facts the market is always talking to itself it is always disagreeing with itself it doesn't care what Barack Obama thinks it doesn't care what Charles Gibson thinks it doesn't care what the left knows to be true it simply is going off the facts the market is the best way to determine the facts in other words freedom and the market is wiser than the experts now I want to just point out this one thing and some of you are not gonna like what I'm gonna say next but it is worth saying next we grow robble we can have Mona Sharon on next week all right next week we're gonna have Mona shower on Mona Sharon is a a wonderful person who is a woman of courage and integrity and intelligence she said something it's CPAC that really made people ticked off I mean first of all CPAC had this woman merit I believe it's Marian lepen it's not marine lepen as the younger one who's kind of calmed down some of the lepen rhetoric which has been anti-semitic and anti-area and lepen who still clings to some of that and she at CPAC said shame on you for having these people there and also attacked them for hypocrisy on supporting Trump and Roy what was his name now I've lost room or in spite of their sexual malfeasance but let's just hear the part about lepen let's play cut number 11 this is Ramona at CPAC talking about inviting lepen Oh quite an interesting person who was on this stage the other day her name is Marian lepen now why was she here why was she here she's a young no longer in office politician from France I think the only reason she was here is because she's named lip Ken and the lepen name is a disgrace her grandfather is a racist and a Nazi she claims that she stands for of him and the fact that CPAC invited her is a disgrace so they're they're shouting her down and they're chasing or you know basically chasing her out of the building and she's been very very she dislikes Trump we've had that but we've had her on before I've kind of debated it with her she does not give Trump any credit at all and I'm gonna talk to her about that now III didn't disagree with this I didn't see why that the Weddell lepen woman should be there I really didn't but I did disagree with her about the sexual hypocrisy I'm untouchable on this because I didn't think Clinton should be impeached for what he was doing either I thought he was a dirtbag but I didn't mean he was a bad president and I didn't as I would say about Trump today I said about Clinton then he's just there to be the president if he's doing a bad job throw him out if he's doing a good job if he's being honest in the presidency he should say there I said that about Clinton then I did attack people for hypocrisy like feminists for their hypocrisy but whether if she's right or wrong if you're not listening to people within your movement who are honest I mean there are people who have crossed the line guys like Bill Kristol when he said he would rather have the deep state than the Trump State I just thought I'm not listening to you anymore nothing you say means anything to me me anymore because if you would rather be run by a secret unaccountable bureaucracy then Donald Trump you don't know what you're talking about you don't we're not after anything that is like the same but that's not true of Mona Mona is actually trying to say something that she doesn't want the movement to slip away into mindless trumpism into following Trump wherever he goes Trump the other day was making comments where he was starting to indicate that maybe he would be in favor of some kind of gun control like raising the age at which person can purchase guns to 21 that's just wrong it's wrong it's not gonna do anything it is falling for the narrative of the left it's appeasing the left when they shouldn't be appeased it's wrong if we fall into mindless trumpism and follow him anywhere we don't know where he's gonna go he is not always a very predictable person if we don't keep lists if we don't keep disagreeing with one another if we don't keep listening to the voices that disagree with us we are going to turn into the left which is now managed to monopolize stupidity and monopolies it does already monopolized evil is now monopolized stupidity we don't want to win that back we state we want to stay an open party of people who disagree with some kind of civility we can disagree intensely but we're going to disagree with civility and listen to the honest people in our party and on our side or else we're gonna turn it into them I mean that would be the work that would be the worst outcome of Donald Trump's election because there's so much good that's come out of it and so much that could come out of it that's not so good we have to be careful all right we're gonna go in we're gonna listen to the interview with Michiyo kaku but I got to say goodbye to YouTube and Facebook before I go let me remind you the mailbag is tomorrow hit the podcast button on the daily wire.com if you're a subscriber hit the Andrew Klavan podcast hit the mailbag and ask your questions meanwhile come on over to the daily wire.com and you can listen to the rest of the show all right this this is a really interesting interview michio kaku has written a book called the future of humanity terraforming Mars interstellar travel immortality and our destiny beyond Earth and it sounds like crackpot stuff but I actually happen to know a lot about the stuff and everything he says in the in the book is actually possible some of it may fail some of it may not turn out to happen the way they think it's gonna happen but it is all absolutely possible Mitchell Kaku is a theoretical physicist futurist and best-selling author he's been featured on just about everywhere he's on CBS and the History Channel all the different all the different channels in physics he is a co-founder of Stringfield theory a theory he says carries on Einsteins quest to create a single grand unified theory of everything let's listen to this interview about his new book the future of humanity first of all Michio Kaku thank you very much for coming on I appreciate it glad to be on the show you know a few years ago I was reading a book on fake science and it was talking about you know various kinds of homeopathic medicine and magnets that control tennis elbow and the last chapter was on space travel to Mars and how it will never be done it'll never be accomplished the difficulties are too great your book the future humanity takes the exact opposite Accu think it's coming it's on the way is that right that's right I think we're entering a new golden age of space travel just three weeks ago a private individual Elon Musk bankrolled a moon rocket a moon rocket that is physically capable of going to the moon on private funds and the month before in December the President of the United States had an executive order yes we're going to the moon Mars and beyond this is not science fiction or fantasy anymore we're talking about money on the table from the private sector and the government we are committed to go into outer space what sure has something changed has have there been developments in the past I mean as many years since we went back to the moon it's been decades now has what has changed this made this possible the change is first of all economics you realize that the movie the Martian with Matt Damon costs more than an actual moon rocket sent by the government to Mars it costs seventy million dollars to go to Mars and the movie costs over a hundred million so Hollywood itself bankroll on Mars ship that's how cheap things have come and of course Elon Musk without taxpayers money without a dime of taxpayers money created the Falcon heavy rocket fully capable of putting the Dragon capsule around the moon and he wants to bankroll a mission to Mars as well and so prices have dropped also Rockets are now reusable that didn't exist before that's gonna drop down the cost of space travel by a factor of 10 because 10,000 dollars a pound to put anything in near-earth orbit that's your way in gold think of your body made out of gold that's what it costs to put you in orbit now with the Falcon Heavy we expect price to drop by a factor of 10 $1,000 a pound to put you in orbit Wow now so you basically a man in your book the future of humanity you basically say that this is a good thing that the private sector has gotten involved your about those it's good thing because I think a combination of private funds and and and government money is called for and that's what's energizing this whole thing not just Elon Musk of SpaceX but Jeff Bezos the richest man in the world the man behind Amazon has created a private spaceport in Texas he has his own fleet of rockets called Blue Origin and he wants to set up an Amazon like transport system between the earth and the moon so we're talking not just about one individual who dreams about going to the stars we're talking about a fleet of Silicon Valley billionaires including those from Google who want to mind the asteroid belt none of that happened back in the 1960s so it's not deja vu all over again it's a whole new ballgame Jeff Bezos of Amazon by the way most of his wealth comes from me directly buying his books but what is it you just talked about mining asteroid belts what's in it for businessmen is is that is that what it is is they do they expect to find you know new kinds of war or old kinds of or what are they looking for well in the short term it is profit let's be blunt about this they're capitalist they're not humanitarians they're not missionaries right they hope to mind the asteroid belt for rare earths that are crucial for the computer program and so with rare earths they hope to have a way to bankroll space exploration however they also have a mission a vision for Elon Musk is to become a multi-planet species because because life is too precious the place on one planet after all the dinosaurs did not have a space program and that's like the dinosaurs are not here today talk about it I mean this is you know it is funny to hear you talk about this because I remember when if a politician got up at a debate and said we need to get off this planet I that was kind of he was just considered a loon I mean he would lose votes over that I think now most of us feel that way what what are the challenges you're talking about traveling through space for a long time to get to Mars what are the challenges that they're facing what are the problems they have to solve well the good of the Moon was like a Sunday picnic it takes three days to go to the moon you could go to the win on Monday and come back on Friday however Mars is different Mars is a new home it takes two years to get to Mars and back nine months to get there and then nine months they get back in a few months to do scientific experiments two years and of course there are dangers like weightlessness and Mars is very cold as a consequence I mean because of the fact that Mars is cold it means that we have to have spacesuits designed to work in a cold atmosphere that's why engineers and scientists have debated what would it take what would it take to terraform Mars that has turned Mars into a Garden of Eden for example if you could have satellites solar satellites that melt the polar ice caps of Mars you can have rivers rivers oceans and seas on Mars once again Mars used to have an ocean the size of the United States of America that's how big that ocean was we could recreate it by melting the polar ice caps and then by having vegetation genetically engineered vegetation that can thrive in that atmosphere you can recreate an agriculture on Mars now remember that's the many decades away however starting next year it starts next year December 2019 NASA will send the first automatic unmanned probe back to the moon 2023 astronauts are gonna go back to the moon 2030s onto Mars Wow Wow we're talking about your book Michio Kaku the future of humanity terraforming Mars interstellar travel immortality and our destiny beyond Earth so I have to ask you about some of the I'll call them more far-out things you talk about this as you get beyond what is what you're talking about 2030 is not that far but then you start talking about some really really interesting things one of them is transferring consciousness itself into machines creating conscious you have a theory that you call the space-time theory of consciousness where you bate you basically think machines can be made conscious like us is that is that fair to say yeah I think that digital immortality is the real possibility as far as biologic immortality of course we're beginning to find the genes that control the aging process we are now understanding why we died something that we did not understand 10-15 years ago but also because computer technology is getting so advanced it may be possible to digitize the soul think about it for a moment all your credit card transactions all your instagrams everything electronic that is known about you today can be clarified to create a reasonable facsimile of you and that's commercially available via Silicon Valley there are Silicon Valley entrepreneurs offering to digitize what is known about you today in the future you'll go to the library and you'll have a nice conversation with Winston Churchill I wouldn't mind talking to Albert Einstein a holographic image of Einstein with all his memories and everything known about his theories digitized in fact you may one day have a conversation with your great-great-great-great gang grandkids we want to know who their great-great great-great great-grandfather was because you've been digitized now then the question is who is new on the other side of that holographic screen well to paraphrase Bill Clinton it all depends on how you define your biological entity that of course is a tape recorder you're talking to but if you define you as all your memories your personalities your sensations all of that combined together then yeah you've not digitized the soul the soul has now been reduced to information if you were talking to that digitalized reconstruction of Einstein could he come up with a new theory or would he only be able to do what he had already done well new theories we think are a combination of what you know in the past that is your sum of knowledge plus chance random connections that you make so in that in that sense yeah a computer would be able to make original contributions not because they're original but because they can put two and two together from different points of view and come up with new now I personally believe that one day we'll take the connectome that is the complete map of the human brain and shoot it into outer space on a laser beam so that you'll reach the moon in one second Mars in 20 minutes and the stars in new years I call this laser porting laser porting your consciousness throughout the universe at the speed of light without booster rockets without accidents without weightlessness without radiation problems and believe it or not I personally believe that this could already exist this is the most efficient way for aliens to shoot their consciousness across the universe without those stupid flying saucers and stupid UFOs they do it with laser beams shot at the speed of light there could be a superhighway right next to the earth carrying billions of souls as they laser port across the universe all consistent with the laws of physics and we are too stupid to know it you know I know there's some of the people listening to this are gonna think that you're like just making this stuff up and I but I have read about this this is real not just in your book the future of humanity but this is really stuff that people are talking about now we have to talk just briefly about the idea of aliens as you bring them up you know first of all where is what is the state right now of our search for alien life well it used to be that we had the giggle factor that we scientists would giggle anytime mentioned flying saucer people and aliens we don't giggle anymore we've taken a census of the Milky Way galaxy we now know there could be billions billions of earth-like twins in outer space perhaps with liquid water oceans perhaps with microbial life perhaps you with people of some sort we no longer laugh at that possibility a whole branch of science called exobiology is now being created and then of course everyone wants to know how come they don't man in the White House lawn and advertise their existence well I like to look at it this way if you're walking in a forest and you meet squirrels and deer do you try to talk to them do you try to wow yeah but eventually you get bored because you don't talk back to you because they have nothing to offer you no insights no stories to tell you in the same way I think alien civilizations will look at look at us as squirrels and here's nice kind of cute little animals but not worth messing with we're simply too primitive that's that that's a vaguely insulting but it always just seems silly to me when I watch a movie and the aliens come in they're hostile it seems to me that if they could reach our planet there they would be so far beyond hostility that you know they'd have left the entire concept behind but maybe that's untrue right and then the movies they say what do they want they want resources they want to steal minerals from the earth but you see there are a lot of uninhabited planets they'd have nobody on them that also have riches the whites are they bother with the rest of natives on the planet with people they could plunder planets without people just as easily and so I think for the most part they are gonna be peaceful however we can't rule out the possibility that they could be warlike so I think that we should basically keep our presence a mystery we should not advertise our existence just in case these alien simply evil or simply don't care they just pay us over one last question there you know some of the things that you talk about and I I do hear a lot of people starting to talk about these things that they almost seem like they go beyond humanity itself so in other words you have a fairly optimistic view in your book the future of humanity at the same time is it humanity if it's a connectome is it humanity if it if we're broadcasting just ideas across space are we going to lose our ourselves when you look into the future do you see human beings disappearing as human beings well if you were to take someone from the Middle Ages who was just finished burning witches and dismembering heretics and you suddenly Pat transport them into our present-day era and they read the tabloid newspapers they would think that all of civilization is going to be doomed to hell right yeah I think when we look at the future we cannot necessarily morally judge future people by our standards in the same way that someone from the Middle Ages cannot judge us today we're much more tolerant of things and as I said my book I also believe in something called a caveman principle or a cavewoman principle we haven't changed in a hundred thousand years our personality the same but what do we want we want to look good we want to have the respect of our peers and people of the opposite sex and so that's why I think that we're gonna retain our humaneness we're not gonna have electrodes coming out of our head we're not gonna be brains in a bag of liquid no we want to look good to the opposite sex we want to look good to our peers I think a hundred years from now will look very similar to ourselves today except we will have robotic and cyber prompt powers comparable to that of maybe a Superman but we'll still look pretty much the same and act pretty much the same because our personalities haven't changed at all michio kaku author of the future of humanity terraforming Mars interstellar travel immortality and our destiny beyond Earth thank you very much for coming on really fascinating fascinating book and fascinating interview thanks a lot my pleasure hi that is that is interesting stuff and I do take issue with him on one thing I personally am going to be a brain-in-a-vat and I that is my that's my ambition that's why I always want it to be as a brain-in-a-vat in this little that way that way my body can run free you know all right sexual sexual follies so this has been a particularly stupid week or stretch of time in the this incredible mission that the left is on to prove that there is no difference between men and women when maybe the first thing everybody learns in life is that there is a difference between men and women I think that maybe like when you're three or four that's when you start to think like oh you know I get this there's a difference between men and women but they want to convince us that we shouldn't that it's wrong to pay attention to this there was a a meeting with that guy James d'amour you know he was where was he speaking it was it in yeah I'm trying to think of Portland I think but anyway he was speaking and they they protet he's the guy who said that at Portland State University and he was he's the guy who said that possibly there were non-sexist reasons why women don't excel in tech that they may not be int that all that interested in it they may be more interested in people and in things he was speaking on a panel at Portland University Portland State University they were trying to pull out the plug there is this I just find this incredibly unfair this transgender wrestler who is taking testosterone he's transitioning from a woman into a make-believe man and so he's beating all these women in wrestling because he's got testosterone being pumped into him which is absurd but one person got the difference between men and women exactly right and that is at nbcnews.com they have a little column called think and I believe the author's name Marcie Bianco and she says the patriarchal race to colonize Mars is just another example of male entitlement it's just like men to go off and colonize Mars dammit you try to you know you tell him to take out the garbage and instead they colonize Mars what the she's he said she starts out she's talking about Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos going into space and she says you know these these men particularly mosque are not only heavily invested in who can get their rocket into space first but in colonizing Mars the desire to colonize have unquestioned unchallenged and automatic access something to any type of body and to use it at will is a patriarchal one indeed there is no ethical consideration among these billionaires about whether this should be done rather the conversation is when it will be done because in the eyes of these intrepid explorers this is the only way to save humanity it's the same instinctual and cultural force that teaches men that everything and everyone in their line of vision is theirs for the taking you know it's just like walking up to a woman and grabbing her by the crotch it's there so just grab it because you can and that is absolutely right run for your life it's because we're coming after you ladies and then we're colonizing Mars I'm Andrew Clavin this is the
