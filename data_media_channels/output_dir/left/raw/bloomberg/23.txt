1
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:07,239
This is Rwanda.

2
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:12,909
Nestled between these
plantations, village homes

3
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,010
and meandering mountain roads

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,403
is a patch of land no bigger
than a football field.

5
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:22,845
From here this guy launches
drones that carry blood

6
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:27,406
to doctors racing to save
their patients' lives.

7
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:29,554
He's the delivery man of the future

8
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:33,241
and he's one of the first
people ever to get the job.

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,772
Now, he's waiting for the
rest of the world to catch up.

10
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,701
(drone engine)

11
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:43,468
(light upbeat music)

12
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:45,324
As technology replaces old jobs,

13
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:48,376
it's also creating new ones.

14
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:53,376
I'm Aki Ito and I'm here to
show you the jobs of the future.

15
00:00:57,722 --> 00:00:59,928
My name is Nizeyimana Abdoul Salam

16
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,511
and I'm a drone operator.

17
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,876
Abdoul works for a
start-up called Zipline.

18
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:14,875
This is where, catch the
drones, that's recovery system.

19
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,509
And in front of you, this is
where we launch the drones.

20
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,592
Cool.

21
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,240
Zipline is headquartered in California.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,211
But it's all the way here, west
of Rwanda's capital, Kigali,

23
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,635
that the company's launched one

24
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:32,385
of the world's first
drone delivery services.

25
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:36,671
(drone engine)

26
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:38,096
So beautiful. (laughs)

27
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:39,823
Does it ever get old?
No.

28
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:40,656
Yeah.

29
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:47,125
Abdoul and his coworkers are
tackling a deadly problem here.

30
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:51,003
Rwanda is among the poorest
countries in the world.

31
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:54,234
And much of it is connected
by winding, bumpy, dirt roads

32
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:59,151
in the mountains, that get
washed out in the rainy seasons.

33
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,496
That's made it incredibly
difficult for regional hospitals

34
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,917
to procure blood in an emergency.

35
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,596
Leaving doctors unable to perform

36
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,096
many lifesaving operations.

37
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,460
The hospital have to procure the car.

38
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,719
You have to drive on and
off for three or four hours

39
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,602
to Kigali, get blood and then come back.

40
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,185
That's complicated.

41
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:31,958
The coast is clear, (mumbles)

42
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,208
and launch the Zipline one three three.

43
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:40,526
When a hospital asks for blood

44
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,943
the Zipline team gets moving.

45
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:47,289
If it's a typical day, a normal day,

46
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,403
you grab a package, you
load it in the plane,

47
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:54,320
you get the plane ready for launch.

48
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:57,029
Flush and secure.

49
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,688
You launch it.

50
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,909
(drone engine)

51
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:03,159
(cheering)

52
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:07,581
And then you wait for the next order.

53
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:09,699
Guided by GPS and other sensors,

54
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,221
the drone flies itself to one
of the hospitals it serves.

55
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:19,117
Then it reaches its destination
and drops off its payload.

56
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,003
Hospital staff retrieve the supplies

57
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:24,298
and the drone heads back to the base.

58
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:26,215
And then, this happens.

59
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:33,662
It's kinda like catching a fish.

60
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:35,883
That's just so complicated,
more than that.

61
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,881
(laughs) It's a little more complicated.

62
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,298
{[Abdoul] Yeah.

63
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,947
Look at the space in
between here, it's tiny.

64
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,614
It's really small.

65
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:55,303
Okay, now you can lift it.

66
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:58,263
Wow! It's incredibly light.

67
00:03:58,263 --> 00:03:59,327
Will you hire me now?

68
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:00,160
Yeah.

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,243
(laughs)

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,136
Abdoul's doing pretty well
for himself these days.

71
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:14,613
He's got a job he loves and
he's studying for grad school.

72
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,754
But all that success today is built

73
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,921
from unimaginable tragedy.

74
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:27,223
When he was three, the
Rwandan government stepped up

75
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:31,409
its decades-long assault
on the Tutsi minority,

76
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:36,024
ordering everyone in the Hutu
majority to kill all Tutsis.

77
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:38,524
(eerie music)

78
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:44,845
In just a hundred days 800,000
people were slaughtered

79
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:47,928
by their neighbors and their friends.

80
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:53,485
When the people doing
the genocide showed up

81
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:55,971
my father was the first to step up.

82
00:04:55,971 --> 00:05:00,419
He could hear the voice in
the corridor, people talking.

83
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,669
Asking where is the rest of the family?

84
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:07,470
Then they killed him and they came in,

85
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,230
they found us in this tiny room.

86
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,262
And then they basically hit
anyone, everyone with a machete.

87
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:15,122
I have a small, you see that?

88
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,122
Yeah. Wow!

89
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:21,950
Despite the head wound, Abdoul survived.

90
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,367
His two siblings and his parents didn't .

91
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:29,228
He ended up at a homeless shelter,

92
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,811
then his grandma found
him and took him in.

93
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:53,809
It was hard, I was a
stubborn kid at school

94
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,905
and I was a lot of trouble to my grandma.

95
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,950
Sometimes I would just quit school.

96
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,711
So definitely I think
the first couple years

97
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:04,464
of school was really, really hard.

98
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,985
Yeah, you were dealing with a trauma.

99
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:09,568
Yeah and then after that
I found my life again.

100
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,163
I was like, okay, if I
get my education right

101
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,841
and I use the knowledge I
have to serve the community,

102
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,174
then I'm happy with my life.

103
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,230
Abdoul studied engineering in college

104
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,764
while holding a variety of
repair and maintenance jobs.

105
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:27,195
When Zipline opened its
first distribution center

106
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:30,061
in rural Rwanda, he jumped
at the chance to work

107
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,811
on cutting edge drone technology.

108
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,436
But his grandma was sad to see

109
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,353
him move out of her home in Kigali.

110
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:41,600
And others in his extended family worried

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,637
he was leaving better
opportunities behind.

112
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:50,394
In Rwanda if you dress well,
you go work with a suit,

113
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:53,996
and you have a big office,
your family will be very happy.

114
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,974
They thought you were successful.

115
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:59,205
If you know you may be
paid way less than someone

116
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:00,995
who's dirty every day, (mumbles)

117
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:04,657
they are true definition
of being successful.

118
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,191
Have you ever worn a suit to Zipline?

119
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:10,296
No. (laughs)

120
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,713
Eventually, they all came around.

121
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:35,320
This spring, Rwanda commemorated 24 years

122
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,903
since the genocide.

123
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,112
In those years the
economy's grown seven-fold.

124
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:52,556
In the bustling city markets,
the crowds of giggling kids,

125
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,762
and the smiles of young
mothers in the villages,

126
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:58,595
you sense the optimism everywhere.

127
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:26,655
From Google to Amazon, tech giants

128
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:28,845
around the world are now racing to get

129
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,203
their drone delivery
trials off the ground.

130
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:34,105
(drone engine)

131
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,791
It's been exciting for Abdoul to be

132
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,455
at the forefront of all that.

133
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:40,217
But would drives him is the impact

134
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,467
he's making closer to home.

135
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,788
I feel like I got another chance to live.

136
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:48,444
So what I want to use that chance for?

137
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,881
Having a lot of beers, buying cars.

138
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:55,298
What should I use that second chance for?

139
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:59,068
And I think using it for
serving the community

140
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:00,827
and make an impact on other people's life

141
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:02,963
was what makes sense for me.

142
00:09:02,963 --> 00:00:00,000
(soft music)
