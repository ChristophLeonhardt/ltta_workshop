we as humans use 10% of our brain dolphins use 20% so as we were leaving the white privilege conference at Ryerson University we strolled past Yonge Dundas Square in downtown Toronto and because it was a day that ended in the letter Y there was of course a protest taking place at Yonge Dundas Square what were they protesting this time folks would you believe what brings Rho to young Dundas Square well we're trying to educate the public about captivity in terms of whales and dolphins and light other fish too or yes yes we're against that as well yep so what's your angle that the captivity is bad for them or yes essentially because in order for the animals to be taken to facilities like SeaWorld or marine land they're taken away from their pods they're taking away from their families their natural habitat we just want for people to be aware of the the inadequacy of the treatments of the animals and just they need to be free we as humans use 10% of our brain dolphins use 20% animals are being corrupted like they don't deserve to be put in captivity when we look at the fish that we eat you'd be against that kind of captivity and that kind of fishing certainly I am they are still sentient beings they still have feelings like we do and normal lives they react to fear and happiness like we do so do you wouldn't want to be put in a tank or a cage per se these animals don't deserve to be in a tank I'm not about any kind of cruelty but certainly we need food to survive as a species of about 8 billion people right well you're talking to a vegan so I I eat a plant-based diet I'm very healthy and I don't need any animal to survive if you're all about Pro fish life would you be anti-abortion - I am not no okay that's a little dichotomy you're fighting for the fishes lives and the fishes right to survive but what about unborn babies well no no I'm just not there yet I'm not that's just what I've standed I've stood with my entire life and I think I mean women are able to speak up for themselves what they want for their own bodies and and fish can't the baby candy they're right no that's true too but yeah I would say it's definitely the woman's choice I think yeah well the empty the tanks protest is wrapping up and I gotta be honest folks I don't want to see flipper suffer in the aquarium but this whole idea of banning fishing I don't know so that's why we're over here at a food truck display I'm kind of hungry and I'm wondering our fish and chips on the menu today for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies wow what a jam-packed roster of incredible speakers we got Katie Hopkins John card ello the big bossman of course Ezreal vent he'll be there so come on down and enjoy an entire day of free thought and libertarian views and conservative perspectives without having to worry about being called a racist go to the rebel live.com and get your tickets today
