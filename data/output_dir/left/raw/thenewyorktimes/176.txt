1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,060
President Trump
made news this week

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,320
by pardoning a conservative
commentator, Dinesh D’Souza,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,860
and hinting that
he may also pardon

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,090
Martha Stewart, 
the lifestyle mogul,

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,070
and Rod Blagojevich, 
the former governor of Illinois.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,440
In discussing these cases,

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,780
President Trump
often returns to a theme.

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,450
He says these people have been

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,240
treated unfairly
by prosecutors,

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,610
and that resonates with
some of his thinking

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,920
about his own case.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,650
Many presidents have
thought themselves confined

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,960
by constitutional norms.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
But there’s really no
question that the Constitution

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,170
gives the president
unlimited authority to pardon

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,230
people convicted 
of federal crimes.

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,470
Previous presidents have used
much of their pardon authority

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,900
on cases of more
ordinary Americans

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,420
who have served their entire
sentence, expressed remorse,

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,550
and after years
applied for a pardon.

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,360
It’s not particularly
unusual for presidents

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,880
to pardon prominent people,
including high-profile

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,070
associates caught up in
the criminal justice system,

24
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,610
but they typically do
it late in their terms.

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,270
That doesn’t mean there are
no responses to pardons

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,250
people might find
inappropriate.

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,030
Impeachment of course
is a possibility,

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,600
or political consequences.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,060
“I feel that Richard Nixon
and his loved ones

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,580
have suffered enough.”

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,750
When President
Gerald Ford pardoned

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,380
President Nixon
after Nixon resigned,

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,070
it surely contributed to
President Ford’s inability

34
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,550
to gain election.

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,040
President Trump has used 
his pardon authority

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,190
really exclusively to focus
on prominent people,

37
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,770
often people closely
aligned with him politically

38
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,100
or caught up in investigations
that he finds unfair

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,410
because they mirror
investigations of him

40
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,180
and his associates.

41
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,180
Many of the cases involve
prosecutions brought

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,750
by people that
President Trump dislikes,

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,159
notably the former director
of the F.B.I. and the former

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,420
United States attorney from the
Southern District of New York

45
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,680
in Manhattan, whom
President Trump fired.

46
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,450
To associates entangled
in the Russia investigation,

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,880
they might think that
President Trump’s willingness

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,639
to issue these pardons

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:00:00,000
suggests he’s prepared
to pardon them as well.
