history was made today and many observers tried to place this moment in history including Republicans Newt Gingrich said today that Donald Trump made quote the most serious mistake of his presidency Republican senator Ben Sasse said this let's not mince words today was a terrible day for the American brand for the American people and for all of our allies we did not negotiate from a position of strength we acted from a position of weakness as a result one of the world's worst despot walked away today from Helsinki with a win arizona's retiring Republican Senator Jeff Flake said this I thought it was shameful and I never thought I'd see an American president throw the intelligence community under the bus like that and agree with a dictator and authoritarian like he did so it's not a good day for the country but no Republican was more forceful in criticism of the president today than Senator John McCain who issued a written statement saying today's press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory the damage inflicted by president Trump's naivete egotism false equivalence and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate but it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake no prior president has ever abased himself more abject Lee before a tyrant during us now Jon Meacham presidential historian and author of the best-selling book the soul of America the battle for our better angels he is also an MSNBC contributor and Richard Stengel as whether she's a former Undersecretary of State in the Obama administration and a former managing editor of Time magazine where he once had the opportunity to interview Vladimir Putin he is now an MSNBC political analyst and Jon Meacham placed this day in history for us that John McCain has issued language about it that is as forceful as what any as any condemning language that we've heard all day from anyone the only thing I would Senator McCain statement is I don't think it's in memory I think it might be in history I think it goes far beyond the living memory of the country just two points looking one looking back one looking forward this is what many Americans feared in the 1790s one of the great divisions and are as when we set out on the national experiment in the Constitution was that the Federalists would be captives of Britain and the democratic-republicans might be captives of France and so there was a fevered kind of conspiracism that shaped the first decade of our political history what's different now is that it may not be a conspiracy theory at this point it's becoming evermore evident that if the president is not an asset of a foreign power then he really is the onus is now on him to explain why he continues to act this way and so sometimes when a duck quacks like a duck it's a duck the other point in looking forward is seems to me that the the unfolding narrative here is one in which this day will be at an incredibly important moment on a time line and that to me that's what's scariest because what is it that Putin really wants from this relationship and I don't think we've yet seen him try to cash the check that he clearly has in his pocket and Rick John McCain went on to say coming close on the heels of president Trump's bombastic and erratic erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain today's press conference marks a recent low in the history of the American presidency I think we have a national security crisis going on as as some people have said you have a an American president the Constitution says he must take care that the laws are faithfully executed he went to Helsinki stood next to a foreign dictator and sided with the dictator over our own intelligence establishment and law enforcement and Justice Department why is that it's very strange what happens now - all those people you're talking about Dan coats before their tens of thousands of men women who was serving in these agencies in Washington and you have the titular head of it who has betrayed all of your interests for a reasons that nobody knows just give us a quick insight into what it is like to be sitting in the room with Vladimir Putin I think we have a photograph of you doing it is what is it that Donald Trump is falling for well I don't know that he's fallen for anything I mean he does he does seem to admire autocrats I mean if if you were Vladimir's it would be a chill cold air coming and hitting me right now I mean that's what it felt when you were talking absolutely I mean Henry Kissinger said to me beforehand you will be surprised how little he tries to charm you there's no there's no affect that he has at all John make sure I want to give you another line from from John McCain because I think John McCain was trying to place this in our history he said not only did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an adversary but speaking for America to the world our president failed to defend all that makes us who we are a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad well that's the great American the in so far we are an exceptional country that is where our exceptionalism has been general Powell once once said that we've gone abroad we've projected force and all we've ever asked for is the ground in which to bury our dead and that's there's there's a lot to that I'm not saying we're a blameless country far from it but we have in fact defined ourselves as what Lincoln's called us the last best hope and President Reagan who Lord God knows what what he's thinking at this point it's saying the last best hope of man on earth and I I think that we have reached a point where there's a significant if it's not irreparable but it is a hugely significant breach in our ongoing faith with the global community and what worries me most is the known unknown as Donald Rumsfeld might put it of what happens next let's say Putin just look at this whole week five six days in in total what happens if Putin launches military action against say the Baltics what is what what is it that President Trump what what about his comments at NATO suggest that he would follow an invocation of Article five and actually project American force in defense of the values that not only do we have an intellectual and moral assent to but a contractual one a treaty one I think that's the great question going forward Jon Meacham and Rick Stengel we really appreciate your invaluable perspectives on this tonight thank you very much for joining us both of you really appreciate it thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
