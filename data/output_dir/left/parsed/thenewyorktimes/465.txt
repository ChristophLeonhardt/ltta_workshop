I actually became interested in
wolves when I was about 6
years old. I read a book by
Jean Craighead George called
“Julie of the Wolves” and
it was about a girl
who is lost in the tundra
in Alaska and she's raised
by a family of wolves.
And when I was 6 I thought I
was going to be just like Julie
and that I would be raised by a
family of wolves in the wild.
We feel as though the March
for Science is crucial.
It's a way to get the public
<involved and motivated about
standing up for science and
science-based decisions when it
comes to managing endangered
species or funding
research projects. We truly
believe science has a very
important role to play
in our lives.
I first started extracting
DNA from organisms when I was
18, and I got hooked on it
then because it's so cool from
just a little vial of —
When you have the DNA,
you can't even tell it's there.
This, you can see tissue.
But when you have the DNA,
it's just a little bit of
clear liquid.
But from that invisible
product, the DNA,
you can learn so much
about an organism.
Once I did my first DNA
extraction, I never went back,
because I think that's so cool.
The sort of hidden history of
anything in a small little,
small little tube.
Our lab focuses on studying
the evolution, diversity and
actually even the genomics
of butterflies and moths.
Showing solidarity with other
scientists here and
the diverse community of
scientists here is important
to me and also inspiring
scientists who haven't been
as civically active before to
take a more civic role in
their science. And so I'm
excited about that aspect of
march and what it inspires
in a generation of scientists.
I was really lucky growing up
to have a dad who was really
interested in nature and
in the ocean, so I spent a
lot of time along the coast.
So I realize that the ocean
is a really important resource
for much of the world.
And I decided that it was
important to invest time and
energy and resources into
studying how climate change was
going to affect this ocean that
impacts so many people.
I am marching for science
because of the way
that it benefits people.
It is really important for
us to continue to support
science federally
and locally,
so that we can protect people.
