I think that we are headed to a dark place in our in society right now in our country and it seems that Democrats are trying very hard to push us into that place and when I say we're headed into that place and we're being pushed there I should say that we're headed or were being pushed further into that kind of dark place because we were already in a you know we're already there to a certain extent we're already in a place where for instance violent anarchist thugs can shut down a city street and accost anyone who happens to pass by which which we've seen repeatedly over the last few years and maybe you saw it happen yet again over the weekend maybe you didn't see because it's not the kind of thing the media likes to report on but the the anti feh thugs shut down an intersection in Portland over the weekend and they blocked traffic they physically threatened motorists to pass by at one point they that was just watching the video where they chased down an elderly man who was who was simply he was it looks like he was just trying to drive through he's just trying to get by and but they were blocking the intersection trying to direct traffic and saying no you you're not allowed to come here and so this guy just tried to get through and they chased down his vehicle and they started beating on his vehicle with batons while screaming like right in his face screaming obscenities at him and you watched the footage of this happening in Portland the police are nowhere to be found they're just happy it's incredible but in the more incredible thing is that we're used to it that these people in masks can just take over a street and if you try to if you try to walk by they'll just beat you up and nobody the police are just letting it happen maybe because they're told to let it happen whatever the reason is they have the law enforcement decided to give these these domestic terrorists free reign for the afternoon meanwhile while that was going on you had the protesters and what protesters I should say put that in scare quotes in Washington DC who were being arrested as they tried to disrupt the Brett Kavanaugh hearings yeah we talked about a few days ago what was disturbing but also pretty hilarious scene of the protesters again in scare quotes banging on the doors of the Supreme Court clawing at the doors screeching like zombies and it's just and this all happened only a you know only a few days several days after Ted Cruz was chased out of a restaurant by a swarming mob of of her a sirs in these have become familiar scenes in America and the thing is when we talk about the Democratic response to all this it would be too generous to say that well Democrat politicians have been silent in the face of all this no they haven't been silent at all actually silence would be an improvement over what we've seen from a lot of these people they've actually encouraged it remember what Maxine Waters said infamously to her supporters a couple months ago she said whenever you see you know somebody in the Trump administration you see a Republican create a crowd and and tell them they're not welcome anywhere that was her direct quote from her they're not welcome anywhere is what she encouraged her supporters to to say and to do
