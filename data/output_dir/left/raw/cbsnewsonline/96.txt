TO THE VEST FOR THE INTEGRITY 

192

202
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,013
OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT IS 

203
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:21,680
COMMON WITH ANY INVESTIGATION 

204
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,781
THAT WE DO. 

205
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:23,749
WE WILL GET TOGETHER SEARCH 

206

WARRANTS AND SUBPOENAS AND THEY 

207
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,318
HAVE BEEN HONORING THOSE.

211
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,224
THAT YOU WERE NOT DOING IN THE 

212
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,061
THREE WEEKS? 

213

NO THE TASK FORCE ACTUALLY WAS 

214
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:47,640
STARTED AND GENERATED AT THE 

215
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,841
BEGINNING OF THE ONSET OF THE 

216
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:49,208
INVESTIGATION. 

217
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,376
WE CONTINUE TO USE AS MANY 

218
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:50,943
RESOURCES AS AVAILABLE. 

219
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,412
I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE 

220
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,346

WE WILL TAP INTO ANYBODY OR ANY 

224
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,617
ORGANIZATION THAT WE CAN TO 

225
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,217
TRACK HER DOWN. 

226
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,218
>> SEVERAL LOCATIONS ARE 

227
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,588
HIGHLIGHTED ON THE MAP. 

228
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,923
WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE 

229
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,223
LOCATIONS? 

230
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:04,957
MIKE WELL, THOSE ARE LOCATIONS 

231
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,158
THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED ON THE 

232
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,360
MAPS TO HELP TO REMIND PEOPLE 

233
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,594
IF THEY WERE TO TAP INTO THOSE 

234
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,130
SITS AND TO BE ABLE TO 

235
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,598
HOPEFULLY GENERATE SOME IDEA OR 

236
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,470
SOME THOUGHTS. 

237
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,604
NO SPECIFIC REASON FOR THOSE 

238
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,405
CERTAIN AREAS, BUT WE ARE 

239
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,540
HOPING THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT THE 

240
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,775
MAP TO BE ABLE TO JOG THEIR 

241
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,208
MEMORY, BASICALLY. 

242
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:28,881

DID YOU WILLINGLY? 

246
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,365
NO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,800
DIVULGE WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON 

248
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,701
THE INVESTIGATION AND WHO WE 

249
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,835
HAVE SPOKEN WITH AND WHERE WE 

250
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:50,836
HAVE GONE TO CONDUCT SEARCHES 

251
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,238
BUT WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF 

252
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,139
SEARCHES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY 

253
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,539
AND ABROAD. 

254
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,840
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 

255
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,407
SEARCHES INCLUDED ACREAGE, 

256
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:56,075
FARMS, HOMES, SILOS, BARN 

257
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,343

WEBSITE, WHY DO YOU BELIEVE 

285
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,750
THAT THIS WILL BE A GAME 

286
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,017
CHANGER? 

287
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,985
IS THIS SOMETHING NEW? 

288
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,852
NO IT IS ANOTHER AVENUE FOR 

289
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,885
PEOPLE TO USE AND ANOTHER

SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE TECHIE 

294
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:44,457
THAN OTHERS. 

295
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,458
SOME PEOPLE WOULD PREFER TO 

296
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,292
PLACE A TELEPHONE CALL AND 

297
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:46,692
WRITE LETTERS. 

298
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,693
WE HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS AND 

299
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:47,993
POSTCARDS. 

300
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,328
THIS IS ONE MORE AVENUE FOR

00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,463
PEOPLE TO TAKE IN THIS DIGITAL 

302
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,364

CINDY FIND? 

306
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:03,742
>> WE HAVE THIS MAP THAT IS 

307
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:04,777
INTERACTIVE THAT THEY CAN PULL 

308
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,178
UP AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP. 

309
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,613
THERE IS ALSO A LINK FOR THE 

310
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,914
TIPS THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE AN 

311
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,216
ANONYMOUS TIP IF THEY SO CHOOSE 

312
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:10,883
AND EVEN SOME TELEPHONE 

313
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,150
NUMBERS. 

314
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,284
IT IS ANOTHER CONDUIT FOR THE

00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:13,719
GENERAL PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO 

316
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,991
USE TO PROVIDE US INFORMATION 

317
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,426
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE 

318
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,427
TO BET THAT INFORMATION AND, 

319
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,428
AGAIN, I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT 

320
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,663
NO MATTER HOW MINUTE OR MINUTE 

321
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,696
THEY THINK THAT THE INFORMATION 

322
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:25,998
MAY BE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 

323
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,466
THEY PROVIDE IT TO US. 

324
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,968
>> SPECULATION -- CHANGING 

325
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,936
BECAUSE OF THE BACKGROUND.

STALKING AND VIOLATING 

327
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,270
RESTRAINING ORDERS. 

328
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:42,348
HAVE YOU MET OTHER PEOPLE WITH 

329
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,049
QUESTIONABLE BACKGROUNDS AND 

330
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:43,883
TALKED WITH OTHER SEX OFFENDERS 

331
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:44,583
IN THE AREA? 

332
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,018
NO I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION WHO 

333
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:46,719
WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH. 

334
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,020
I AM NOT GOING TO RELEASE ANY 

335
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,255
NAMES OR ANY OF THE INFORMATION 

336
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,356
ON THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF I 

337
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,090
WILL NOT DO THAT. 

338
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,461
>> SOMEONE THAT SHE KNOWS? 

339
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,095
SOME MISUNDERSTANDING?

00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:57,663
OPTIONS, ALL POSSIBILITIES. 

342
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,798
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT 

343
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,433
UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO BRING HER 

344
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:00,633
BACK. 

345
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,834
>> WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THE 

346

00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:11,377
ABLE TO READ -- TO RELEASE THE 

348
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,211
TIMELINE BUT LIKE ANY OTHER 

349
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,245
INVESTIGATION, WE WILL COME UP 

350
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,547
WITH THE TIMELINE AND WE WILL 

351
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,648
USE THAT YOU COME TO A 

352
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,482
CONCLUSION OF THE 

353
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:16,849
INVESTIGATION. 

354
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,084
WE HAVE A TIMELINE IN PLACE WE 

355
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,418
DO NOT FEEL LIKE THE PUBLIC IS 

356
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,219
AT RISK PER SE. 

357
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:20,986
CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING 

358
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:21,954
THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED 

359
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,187
ABOUT. 

360
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:31,297
WE UNDERSTAND THAT AS AN

INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY AND TEAM 

362
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,132
FELT THAT THE PUBLIC WAS AT 

363
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,333
RISK, WE WOULD NOTIFY THEM OF 

364
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,334
THAT AND PROVIDE THAT 

365
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:35,667
INFORMATION. 

366
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,869
SO FAR WE HAVE NOT FOUND THE 

367
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,670
NEED TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT. 

368
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,510
>> ARE LEADS COMING IN? 

369
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:44,910
>> THEY ARE. 

370
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,112
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 

371
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:46,946
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM HAS RECEIVED 

372
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,581
IN EXCESS OF 1500 TIPS AND THAT 

373
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,048
CONTINUES TO CLIMB. 

374
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,616
I CAN TELL YOU THAT AND -- AS 

375
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,617
AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM, WE HAVE 

376
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,618
CONDUCTED 500 INTERVIEWS BUT I 

377
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,286
CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CRIME 

378
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,089
STOPPERS HAS GOT THE AWARD OF 

379
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:10,102
TWO -- I THINK IT IS $356,414. 

380
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:10,869
THAT COMES FROM 228 DONORS. 

381
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,071
CERTAINLY THIS HAS GENERATED A 

382
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:12,737
LOT OF PUBLIC INTEREST. 

383
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:13,939
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED, AS ARE 

384
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:14,105
WE. 

385
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,041
WE WOULD WELCOME THE TELEPHONE 

386
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,975
CALLS AND INFORMATION SO THAT 

387
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,209
WE CAN TRY TO FIND HER. 

388
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,611
LIKE WILL IT ALLOW YOU TO GET 

389
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,145
BETTER TIPS? 

390
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,446
TO GIVE PEOPLE A BETTER IDEA OF 

391
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:25,518
WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED? 

392
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,352
THOSE TIPS WOULD BE BETTER? 

393
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,953
>> WHAT WAS THE FIRST PART OF 

394
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:28,286
THE QUESTION? 

395
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,322
MIKE AFTER 3 1/2 WEEKS OF THE 

396
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:30,956
INVESTIGATION, NEW INFORMATION 

397
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:31,857
TO GIVE PEOPLE A BETTER SENSE 

398
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:36,996
OF WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED AND 

399
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:37,563
TO INCREASE THE QUALITY? 

400
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,731
NO I DO NOT THINK SO. 

401
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,266
THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE WANT 

402
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,167
TO KEEP THE INVESTIGATION AND 

403
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:47,339
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF IT. 

404
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,741
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DO 

405
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,475
WITH THE DCI. 

406
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,509
WE DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION 

407
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,544
ON THE INVESTIGATION AS IT IS 

408
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:51,811
ONGOING. 

409
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,512
SO AGAIN, THAT IS WHY WE 

410
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:59,318
REEMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE THAT 

411
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,152
IF THEY THINK THEY KNOW THE 

412
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,187
INFORMATION, TO PROVIDE THAT TO 

413
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,521
US AND WE WILL LOOK AT THAT. 

414
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,289
>> DIVIDING RESOURCES? 

415
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:03,722
>> YES. 

416
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,890
>> HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU THAT 

417
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:14,266
HE HAS NOT LED TO ATTEMPTS OF 

418
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:14,599
FINDING OUT? 

419
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,901
>> WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IT 

420
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,035
WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO FINDING 

421
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:17,235
HER. 

422
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,003
WE HAVE NOT LOST HOPE. 

423
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,138
WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO BRING 

424
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,475
HER BACK HOME SAFELY. 

425
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,508
WE ARE NOT FRUSTRATED. 

426
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:24,042
WE JUST ARE DILIGENT. 

427
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,544
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. 

428
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,679
>> ARE YOU STILL LETTING 

429
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:38,757
EVERYBODY -- THEY ARE WAITING 

430
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,458
-- CAPPING THE REWARD? 

431
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,693
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO CAP 

432
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,994
ANYTHING BUT WE DO NOT THINK 

433
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:42,628
ALONG THOSE LINES. 

434
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,929
WE THINK THAT IF MONEY IS 

435
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,763
GENERATED TO HELP BRING HER 

436
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,664
HOME, WE WELCOME THAT. 

437
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:53,873
>> HISTORY IN THIS AREA OF 

438
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,774
OBJECTIONS IN THIS REGION? 

439
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,208
>> I DO NOT HAVE SPECIFICS FOR 

440
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:56,408
IT. 

441
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,943
I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS 

442
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,777
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING 

443
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,012
INTO AND KEEPING AN OPEN MIND 

444
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:00,279
ON. 

445
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,713
I KNOW THAT TRAFFICKING IS 

446
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:02,414
SOMETHING THAT IS DISCUSSED ON 

447
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,949
A REGULAR BASIS BUT I DO NOT 

448
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,151
HAVE ANY STATISTICS FOR YOU BUT 

449
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,485
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE 

450
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:06,718
THAT. 

451
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,754
THAT MAKES PEOPLE SAY, SHE CAN 

452
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,858
GO ANYWHERE SHE WANTS. 

453
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:17,863
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE 

454
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,264
MISSING? 

455
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,298
>> WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE -- 

456
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,699
WE HAVE A TIMELINE THAT IS WHAT 

457
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,134
WE USE AS PART OF OUR 

458
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:22,501
INVESTIGATION. 

459
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,535
I DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT YOU 

460
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:24,069
ARE ASKING. 

461
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,604
WE FEEL CONFIDENT OF THE 

462
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,004
TIMELINE ITSELF. 

463
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:31,477
>> PART OF THE TIMELINE? 

464
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,711
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK 

465
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:32,978
INTO. 

466
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,714
AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM, WE 

467
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,749
WILL LOOK FROM THE EARLY 

468
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,583
MORNING HOURS OF THAT 

469
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,884
PARTICULAR DAY ON JULY 18 UP 

470
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:39,685
UNTIL THE EVENING HOURS. 

471
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,286
WE TRIED TO GET AS MUCH 

472
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:43,455
INFORMATION AND IS MUCH AS WE 

473
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,690
CAN WHEN IT COMES TO THESE 

474
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,326
TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS. 

475
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,760
>> HAVE YOU EVER DEALT WITH 

476
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,063
SOMETHING SIMILAR? 

477
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,197
>> SADLY, WE HAVE. 

478
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,698
WE HAVE HAD MISSING PEOPLE 

479
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:54,233
BEFORE. 

480
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,068
SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DEAL 

481
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:05,911
WITH. 

482
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:06,912
SADLY, WE WILL HAVE TO PROBABLY 

483
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,247
DEAL WITH IT IN THE FUTURE. 

484
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,448
WE HOPE NOT BUT IT IS A 

485
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:09,781
POSSIBILITY. 

486
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:10,482
WE HAVE DONE THESE 

487
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:10,982
INVESTIGATIONS BEFORE. 

488
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,785
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS 

489
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,155
A JOINT INVITATION TO 

490
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,289
INVESTIGATION WITH THE FBI AND 

491
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,190
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND A 

492
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,191
NUMBER OF AGENCIES FROM ACROSS 

493
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,526
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE WILLING TO 

494
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,460
ASSIST AND HELP WHICH WE 

495
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,160
GREATLY APPRECIATE. 

496
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,962
>> HOW MANY DIVIDING RESOURCES 

497
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,832
BETWEEN THE WEBSITE AND THERE 

498
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:27,233
TIP LIKE? 

499
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,234
ARE YOU ADDING MORE PERSONAL? 

500
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,168
IS PERSONNEL GOING TO BE 

501
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:29,468
REASSIGNED? 

502
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,369
>> WHATEVER PERSONALITIES WE 

503
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,003
ARE GOING TO USE. 

504
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,171
THAT IS WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE 

505
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,272
TO DO AS THE INVESTIGATION 

506
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:33,572
CONTINUES. 

507
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:46,618
>> WHEN WOULD THE NUMBER 

508
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:47,553
DECREASED AND HOW MUCH MONEY 

509
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,854
ARE WE SPENDING WORKING ON THE 

510
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:49,054
CASE? 

511
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,089
SELECT THE MONEY, I DON'T KNOW 

512
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,323
BUT I DO NOT TRACK THAT. 

513
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,994
MY JOB IS TO INVESTIGATE CRIME. 

514
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,595
THE MONEY IS NOT AN ISSUE BUT 

515
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,596
WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT THAT. 

516
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,831
OUR ISSUE IS TRYING TO TRACK 

517
00:14:58,831 --> 00:14:59,431
DOWN MOLLY. 

518
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,632
>> HOW IS THE MORALE AMONG 

519
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:00,999
INVESTIGATORS? 

520
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:01,834
>> OUR MORREALE IS GOOD. 

521
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:07,806
WE FEEL CONFIDENT AND QUITE 

522
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,339
HONESTLY I APPRECIATE THE 

523
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,541
QUESTION, BUT IT IS REALLY NOT 

524
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,076
ABOUT US BUT IT IS ABOUT TRYING 

525
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,610
TO FIND MOLLY. 

526
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,245
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO 

527
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:13,645
FIND HER. 

528
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:20,786
>> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? 

529
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,854
>> HOW MANY AGENTS OR 

530
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,154
DETECTIVES? 

531
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,822
NO I DO NOT HAVE A NUMBER RIGHT 

532
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,124
NOW BUT I HAVE A NUMBER OF 

533
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,025
PEOPLE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW 

534
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,559
RUNNING UP LEADS AS WE SPEAK IT 

535
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,494
IS ONGOING IT CONTINUES TO 

536
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,795
REQUIRE A LOT OF MANPOWER AND 

537
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,796
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEDICATE 

538
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,264
THAT MANPOWER FOR BRINGING HER 

539
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:32,898
HOME. 

540
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:45,744
>>> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? 

541
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,845
>> I DO NOT FORESEE LESSENING 

542
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,280
MANPOWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME. 

543
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,181
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

544
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,416
DRIVE FORWARD AND WHATEVER IT 

545
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,317
TAKES BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE 

546
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,451
OTHER THINGS THAT POP UP AND 

547
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
REQUIRE ATTENTION THAT MEANS 

548
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,553
THAT WE BRING OTHER PEOPLE IN 

549
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,487
AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. 

550
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:55,687
OKAY? 

551
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:56,755
AGAIN, I WOULD EMPHASIZE, IF 

552
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,123
YOU COULD, TO THE PUBLIC, TO 

553
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,924
TAP INTO FINDING MOLLY. 

554
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,159
IF YOU CAN PUSH THAT OUT, THAT 

555
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,759
WOULD BE GREAT. 

556
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,393
WE APPRECIATE IT. 

557
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,961
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 

558
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:14,273
THANK YOU. 

559
