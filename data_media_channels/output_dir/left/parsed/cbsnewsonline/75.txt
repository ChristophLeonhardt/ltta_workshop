THE PROCESSION FOR SENATOR JOHN 
MCCAIN IS UNDER WAY. 
HIS BODY HAS JUST BEEN TAKEN 
FROM THE FUNERAL HOME. 
IT'S NOW HEADING, YOU SEE THE 
MOTORCADE RIGHT THERE GUARDED 
BY THOSE POLICE OFFICERS. 
IT'S HEADING TO THE STATE 
CAPITOL BUILDING. 
THERE'LL BE A PUBLIC CEREMONY 
THERE AND THERE ARE ALSO 
SEVERAL EVENTS PLANNED FOR HIM. 
WE WANT TO REJOIN OUR LOCAL 
AFFILIATE THERE KPHO FOR THEIR 
LIVE COVERAGE. 
>>REPORTER:  LET'S GET A NOSE-
ON SHOT WITH HIM, SO DESCEND, 
AND THEN WE'LL GET THAT NOSE. 
>> I'M REENA NINAN HERE AT 
CBSN. 
YOU ARE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE 
OF JOHN MCCAIN'S BODY AS YOU 
SEE THE MOTORCADE, IT IS 
PROGRESSING FROM THE FEUN RAM 
HOME -- FUNERAL HOME AND 
HEADING NOW STRAIGHT FOR THE 
CAPITOL BUILDING, LEFT EARLY 
THIS MORNING, ABOUT 9:50 A.M. 
LOCAL TIME THERE IN ARIZONA. 
HE IS OF COURSE ACCOMPANIED BY 
HIS WIFE, MRS. CINDY McCAIN AND 
THE FAMILY AS WELL, AND THE 
HEARSE WILL ARRIVE, AS I 
MENTIONED, AT ARIZONA STATE 
CAPITOL PLAZA. 
AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTADING THAT 
THE FAMILY WILL THEN BE GREETED 
BY THE GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA DOUG 
DUCEY. 
AS YOU SEE HIM AND HIS WIFE 
WALKING RIGHT DOWN THERE AND 
STATE POLICE YOU SEE WITH THEIR 
HEADS DOWN LINED UP. 
WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING THAT -- 
THAT'S THE FIRST LADY THERE 
ANGELA DUCEY. 
SENATOR McCAIN WILL BE THEN 
RETRIEVED, HIS BODY IN THE 
CASKET WILL BE RETRIEVED BY THE 
ARIZONA NATIONAL GUARD CASKET 
TEAM AND THEN IT HEADS STRAIGHT 
RIGHT THERE WHERE THE GOVERNOR 
IS HEADED INTO THE ARIZONA 
STATE CAPITOL ROTUNDA. 
WE KNOW THAT MRS. McCAIN WILL 
THEN PROCEED ON TO THE ROTUNDA. 
SHE'LL BE ESCORTED BY HER SONS 
JACK AND JIMMY. 
AND THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY 
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL, 
BIG FAMILY, McCAIN FAMILY HAS, 
INCLUDING SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN. 
AND WE KNOW A BIG PART OF JOHN 
MCCAIN'S LIFE OF SERVICE, A BIG 
PART OF HIS MILITARY CAREER WAS 
ALSO A FOCUS IN HIS SENATE 
YEARS ON VETERANS, ON THE 
MILITARY. 
THERE WILL BE A BIG TRIBUTE TO 
THEM, A NOD OF THE HAT THERE AS 
YOU SEE THE FOLKS LINED UP 
THERE, ARIZONA VETERANS, 
MILITARY, LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
FIRE, FIRST RESPONDERS, THAT'S 
WHO WILL BE LINING THE SIDES OF 
THE CAPITOL AS THIS PROCESSION 
IS UNDER WAY. 
AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT THE SENATOR HAS GIVEN A 
GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT AND 
PLANNING TO, AND THREE DAYS OF  
LIFE, CELEBRATION OF HIS LIFE, 
HIS JOURNEY AND ALSO EVERYTHING 
HE STOOD FOR, INCLUDING SERVICE 
AND HONOR AND HIS COUNTRY. 
LET'S LISTEN IN A LITTLE BIT. 
 
>> AND AS THE MOTORCADE IS 
GETTING CLOSER TO THE CAPITOL 
THERE, IT'S WORTH REMINDING 
EVERYONE, TODAY WOULD HAE BEEN 
JOHN MCCAIN'S 82nd BIRTHDAY. 
HE PASSED AWAY ON SATURDAY AT 
THE AGE OF 81. 
AND SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU ARE 
SEEING NOW AND OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS AS HIS BODY WILL 
MAKE ITS WAY RIGHT NOW FROM THE 
FUNERAL HOME TO THE STATE 
CAPITOL AND EVENTUALLY TO 
WASHINGTON, SO MUCH OF THIS HAS 
HAD JOHN MCCAIN'S FINGERPRINTS 
ALL OVER IT. 
HE HAS MADE DECISIONS ON 
EXACTLY WHO WILL CARRY HIS 
CASKET OUT, WHO WILL EULOGIZE 
HIM. 
WE ARE EXPECTING GEORGE W. BUSH 
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA AMONG THOSE 
WHO WILL HONOR HIM. 
AND AS THE CASKET IS MAKING ITS 
WAY OVER TO THE CAPITOL, WE ARE 
EXPECTING AT ABOUT 1:00 P.M. 
EASTERN A PRIVATE CEREMONY WILL 
TAKE PLACE INSIDE THE ROTUNDA 
THERE OF THE ARIZONA STATE 
CAPITOL, AND THEN AFTER THAT 
PRIVATE CEREMONY, IT'LL BE OPEN 
TO THE PUBLIC. 
THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THE PUBLIC, THOSE PEOPLE IN 
ARIZONA PARTICULARLY HAD TIME 
AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAY THEIR 
RESPECTS TO A MAN WHO HAD 
SERVED IN THE SENATE FOR 
DECADES REPRESENTING THE STATE 
OF ARIZONA. 
THE PUBLIC VIEWING IS ACTUALLY 
ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE. 
SO IF YOU'RE NOT IN ARIZONA, 
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW 
THE CASKET AS WELL IN ADDITION 
TO OUR LIVE COVERAGE. 
WE KNOW THAT JOHN MCCAIN WAS 
ACTUALLY THE SON OF A DECORATED 
FOUR STAR NAVY ADMIRAL. 
AND HE MENTIONED THAT 
THROUGHOUT HIS CHILDHOOD, AND 
SO MUCH OF HIS SERVICE TO HIS 
COUNTRY AND ALSO THE SERVICE OF 
OTHERS WILL BE EMPHASIZED 
THROUGHOUT THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
LET'S LISTEN IN AS YOU SEE 
RIGHT THERE THE GOVERNOR OF 
ARIZONA AND HIS WIFE, THE FIRST 
LADY AS WELL JOINING -- AND 
THEY WILL GREET THE McCAIN 
FAMILY AS THE CASKET ARRIVES AT 
THE STATE CAPITOL IN ARIZONA. 
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING A LIVE 
PROCESSION UNDER WAY NOW AS THE 
BODY OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN IS 
BEING BROUGHT TO THE STATE 
CAPITOL THERE, GREETED BY THE 
FIRST LADY AND THE GOVERNOR OF 
ARIZONA. 
YOU KNOW, JOHN MCCAIN OFTEN 
TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE HE 
MADE ARIZONA HIS HOME THAT THE 
LONGEST AMOUNT OF TIME HE 
SERVED IN ONE AREA WAS 
UNFORTUNATELY IN THAT INFAMOUS 
PRISON IN NORTH VIETNAM. 
AND HE SAID WHAT HE LOVED SO 
MUCH ABOUT ARIZONA AND WHY HE 
CHOSE TO MAKE THIS HIS HOME WAS 
THE BEAUTY OF THE STATE, THE 
SPIRIT OF THE CITIZENS, AND 
THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHERE HE AND 
HIS WIFE CINDY CHOSE TO RAISE 
THEIR CHILDREN RIGHT THERE IN 
PHOENIX. 
THEY BUILT A HOME ALONG WHAT'S 
KNOWN AS OAK CREEK. 
IT'S BETWEEN COTTONWOOD AND 
SEDONA IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH 
ARIZONA. 
AND HE'S QUOTED AS SAYING HE 
HAS NEVER -- I HAVE NEVER IN MY 
LIFE LOVED ONE PLACE MORE. 
AND TODAY THE STATE OF ARIZONA 
WILL BID FAREWELL TO THE 
SENATOR WHO HAS SPENT 40 YEARS 
SERVING HIS COUNTRY. 
IN FACT, IN THE LAST 40 YEARS 
ONLY TWO INDIVIDUALS HAVE 
ACTUALLY LIED IN THE ARIZONA 
STATE CAPITOL IN THE ROTUNDA, 
ARIZONA STATE SENATOR MER RIL 
JARRETT BACK IN 2006 AND THEN 
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST JESSE 
OWENS, ALSO A TUCSON RESIDENT, 
THAT WAS BACK IN 1980. 
AGAIN, THE CEREMONY WILL TAKE 
PLACE INSIDE THE ARIZONA STATE 
CAPITOL ROTUNDA AS THEY ARE NOW 
BRINGING THE BODY OUT OF THE 
HEARSE OF JOHN MCCAIN. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
 
 
>> LOVING GOD, SEE OUR TEARS 
FOR OUR BROTHER, OUR FATHER, 
OUR HUSBAND, OUR FELLOW 
CITIZEN, OUR SENATOR. 
LET THESE TEARS BRING BLOOMS IN 
THE DESERT HE LOVED, IN THE 
COUNTRY HE SERVED, AND IN ALL 
OUR HEARTS. 
AMEN. 
>> PLEASE BE SEATED. 
>> GOVERNOR DUCEY, GOVERNOR 
BREWER, GOVERNOR SIDINGTON, 
GOVERNOR NAPOLITANO, 
REPRESENTATIVE KOLBE, SENATOR
SCHLATZ, SENATOR HE LAWLLER, 
SENATOR FLAKE, CINDY McCAIN AND 
ALL MEMBERS OF THE McCAIN 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS. 
JOHN MCCAIN BELIEVED IN 
AMERICA. 
HE BELIEVED IN ITS PEOPLE, ITS 
VALUES AND ITS INSTITUTIONS. 
YOU SEE, HE CAME TO THIS 
REALIZATION DURING HIS TIME AS 
A P.O.W. 
IN VIETNAM. 
I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY COUNTRY, 
HE SAID WHEN I WAS A PRISONER 
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S. 
AS A RESULT HE DEDICATED HIS 
LIFE TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY. 
WHEN HE SAW CHALLENGES TO ITS 
INSTITUTIONS OR VALUES, HE 
FOUGHT TO PROTECT THEM, THUS 
HIS EFFORTS TO REIGN IN EXCESS 
CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES AND 
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS WHICH HE 
VIEWED AS CORRUPTING OUR VALUES 
AND INSTITUTIONS. 
AND HIS INSISTENCE THAT BATTLE 
FD DETAINEES BE TREATED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN LAW 
AND VALUES. 
IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, HIS 
BELIEFS LED SENATOR McCAIN TO 
PROMOTE AMERICAN PRINCIPLES OF 
FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY FOR 
OTHERS, AND IN OUR MILITARY 
CAMPAIGNS TO SUPPORT OUR 
MISSIONS AND OUR TROOPS. 
JOHN HAD A KEEN EYE FOR 
AMERICAN INTERESTS AND COULD 
SPOT DANGER'S ADVERSARIES A 
MILE AWAY. 
HE WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO 
ADVOCATE THE SURGE IN IRAQ, TO 
REGAIN THE INITIATIVE IN THE 
WAR THERE. 
I'VE BEEN WITH SENATOR McCAIN 
ALL AROUND THE WORLD, AND I 
WILL TELL YOU THAT HE HAD 
BETTER INSTINCTS ABOUT HOW AND 
WHEN AND WHERE TO ASSERT 
AMERICAN POWER THAN ANY OTHER 
LEADER THAT I'VE KNOWN. 
HE HAD BEEN TO MORE COUNTRY, 
KNEW MORE FOREIGN LEADERS AND 
HAD A BETTER GRASP OF HISTORY 
THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN 
OFFICIAL, INCLUDING OUR 
SECRETARIES OF STATE. 
ONE ILLUSTRATION THAT WE'RE ALL 
FAMILIAR WITH WAS WHEN OTHERS 
WERE LOOKING INTO VLADIMIR 
PUTIN'S EYES WITH AN EYE OF 
UNDERSTANDING HIM AND REACHING 
ACCOMMODATION WITH HIM. 
JOHN, OF COURSE, SAID I LOOKED 
INTO HIS EYES AND I SAW KGB. 
WHILE I BELIEVE JOHN'S GREATEST 
CONTRIBUTION WAS TO AMERICAN 
NATIONAL SECURITY, WE MUST 
COMMENT A BIT ON ARIZONA 
INTERESTS AS WELL. 
IN A WORD, HE LOVED HIS ADOPTED 
STATE. 
HE LOVED ITS BEAUTY, HE WAS 
COMMITTED TO PROTECTING OUR 
WATER, OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR 
FORESTS. 
HE WORKED THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER 
WITH OUR NATIVE AMERICAN 
CITIZENS AND WITH ARIZONA'S 
VETERANS. 
HE WAS A BIG CHAMPION OF OUR 
MANY MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. 
SOME HAVE DISAGREED WITH SOME 
OF SENATOR McCAIN'S VOTES ON 
POLICY POSITIONS, BUT THAT 
SHOULD NOT DIMINISH OUR 
GRATITUDE FOR HIS SERVICE. 
AND LET'S RETURN TO WHERE I 
BEGAN, JOHN'S LOVE FOR AMERICA 
AND ARIZONA. 
HE REPRESENTED OUR VALUES ALL 
OVER THE WORLD AS SENATOR FROM 
ARIZONA, AND AMERICA IS 
STRONGER FOR HIS FIERCE DEFENSE 
OF OUR VALUES. 
WE CAN BE PROUD HE WAS OUR 
SENATOR. 
I CONSIDER IT A GREAT PRIVILEGE 
TO HAVE SERVED WITH JOHN AND I 
WILL MISS HIM AS A FRIEND AND 
AS A STRONG FORCE FOR AMERICA 
IN THE WORLD. 
>> WE'VE ALL SEEN THE GRAINY 
VIDEO, A YOUNG MAN IN HIS 30s 
EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE FOLDING 
DOORS OF A BUS, PLOWS FORWARD 
WITH STRENGTH. 
HIS FEET LAND ON THE GROUND, 
AND HE LIMPS FORWARD TOWARDS 
FREEDOM. 
IT'S JOHN MCCAIN, AND HE'S JUST 
SPENT FIVE YEARS AS A PRISONER 
OF WAR, SHOT DOWN, EJECTED FROM 
HIS PLANE, HIS RIGHT LEG AND 
BOTH ARMS ARMS BROKEN. 
HE MANAGED MIRACULOUSLY TO SAVE 
HIMSELF FROM DROWNING IN THE 
LAKE IN WHICH HE LANDED ONLY TO 
BE CAPTURED BY THE NORTH 
VIETNAMESE. 
NO ONE EXPECTED JOHN MCCAIN TO 
MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT. 
BUT AS ONE OF HIS PELLO P.O.W.s 
PUT IT, DYING WAS NOT IN HIS 
PLAN -- FELLOW POWs PUT IT, 
DYING WAS NOT IN HIS PLAN. 
CONFINED TO SOLITUDE AND 
TORTURE, THIS SON AND GRANDSON 
OF NAVY ADMIRALS REPEATEDLY 
REFUSED RELEASE UNTIL EVERY 
OTHER AMERICAN BROTHER WAS 
RELEASED WITH HIM. 
OF ALL THE SPEECHES, INTERVIEWS 
AND TOWN HALL MEETINGS THAT 
HAVE BEEN PLAYED AND REPLAYED 
THESE DAYS SINCE JOHN MCCAIN 
HAS LEFT US, IT'S THIS MOMENT 
MORE THAN ANY OTHER THAT CAN'T 
HELP BUT STIR A SPIRIT OF 
PATRIOTISM DEEP INSIDE EVERY 
AMERICAN, BRINGING GOOSE BUMPS 
TO YOUR ARMS AND LEAVING THE 
HAIR STANDING ON THE BACK OF 
YOUR NECK BECAUSE AS YOU WATCH 
HIS RELEASE AND LEARN HIS 
STORY, THE SENATOR'S LIFE, 
LESSONS AND WISDOM TAKE ON A 
MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL CONTEXT. 
WHEN JOHN MCCAIN CALLED ON US 
TO SERVE A PURPOSE GREATER THAN 
ONE'S OWN SELF INTEREST, IT 
WASN'T A TALKING POINT DESIGNED 
TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION. 
IT WAS HOW HE HAD ACTUALLY 
LIVED HIS LIFE AND CONTINUED TO 
LIVE HIS LIFE. 
IT'S HOW HE WANTED US TO LIVE 
OURS. 
HIS TALK OF COUNTRY FIRST 
WASN'T SIMPLY A SLOGAN ON A 
YARD SIGN. 
IT WAS WHAT JOHN MCCAIN HAD 
DONE AND DEMONSTRATED OVER AND 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE 
NAVY, THROUGH VIETNAM, AND ALL 
THE WAY TO HIS FAVORITE BATTLES 
ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED 
STATES SENATE. 
IN 2008 HE ELECTRIFYIED MANY IN 
MINNEAPOLIS PROCLAIMING WE ARE 
AMERICANS AND WE NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE NEVER QUIT. 
WE NEVER HIDE FROM HISTORY. 
WE MAKE HISTORY. 
THOSE WEREN'T THE EMPTY WORDS 
OF SOME POLITICIAN GRABBING THE 
MICROPHONE AND THE SPOTLIGHT 
FOR A FEW FLEETING MOMENTS. 
MEN HAD FOLLOWED JOHN MCCAIN 
INTO BATTLE, AND WE KNEW WE 
COULD DO THE SAME. 
THIS MAN WAS TRUSTED AND HE WAS 
TESTED, QUALITIES IN 
INCREASINGLY SHORT SUPPLY. 
WE SOMETIMES THINK THAT 
POLITICS IS LIFE AND DEATH, BUT 
JOHN MCCAIN KNEW BETTER BECAUSE 
HE HAD ACTUALLY SEEN DEATH AND 
DYING AND TRAGEDY. 
MAKE NO MISTAKE, HE FOUGHT LIKE 
HELL FOR THE CAUSES HE BELIEVED 
IN. 
HE PLOWED THROUGH ELECTION 
AFTER ELECTION WITH THE ENERGY 
AND FOCUS OF A WARRIOR. 
BUT ALONG THE WAY HE DID IT 
WITH HUMOR AND HUMANITY AND 
WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE 
PRINCIPLES HE HELD SO DEAR. 
I'D RATHER LOSE AN ELECTION 
THAN LOSE A WAR, AND WE KNEW HE 
WAS TELLING US THE TRUTH. 
IN THAT WAY JOHN MCCAIN WAS 
ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS. 
HE BROUGHT US ABOVE POLITICS. 
JOHN IS PROBABLY THE ONLY 
POLITICIAN WHO COULD GET US TO 
SET ASIDE POLITICS AND COME 
TOGETHER AS A STATE AND A 
NATION AS WE HAVE. 
LIKE MANY OF US HERE IN 
ARIZONA, JOHN MCCAIN WAS FROM 
SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT HIS SPIRIT, 
SERVICE AND FIERCE INDEPENDENCE 
ULTIMATELY HELPED SHAPE THE 
STATE WITH WHICH HE BECAME 
SYNONYMOUS. 
ALMOST EXACTLY 20 YEARS AGO 
JOHN MCCAIN DELIVERED THE 
EULOGY AT BARRY GOLDWATER'S 
FUNERAL, THAT OTHER GREAT 
LEGENDARY ARIZONAN WHO AMERICA 
HOLDS DEAR IN ITS HEART. 
WHERE BARRY GOLDWATER WAS BORN 
IN ARIZONA JOHN MCCAIN WAS 
ARIZONA'S FAVORITE ADOPTED SON. 
NEARLY 45 YEARS OLD WHEN HE 
MOVED TO ARIZONA. 
THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE HE SAID 
WHERE HE TRULY FOUND A 
CONNECTION. 
ARIZONA HAS ENCHANTED AND 
CLAIMED ME, HE WROTE. 
I LOVE IT SO MUCH, AND I AM SO 
GRATEFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF 
REPRESENTING THE STATE AND ITS 
PEOPLE. 
BUT IN REALITY WE WERE THE ONES 
WHO WERE PRIVILEGED, PRIVILEGED 
TO HAVE JOHN MCCAIN FIGHTING 
FOR US, PRIVILEGED TO LEARN 
FROM HIM, PRIVILEGED THAT WHEN 
HE WAS BACK HOME TO RUN INTO 
HIM AT THE MOVIES OR AT A BALL 
GAME OR AT STARBUCKS. 
JUST LIKE HE WAS ANY ONE OF US, 
PRIVILEGED TO PROUDLY CALL HIM 
A FELLOW ARIZONAN. 
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD JOHN 
MCCAIN WAS ARIZONA. 
WHEN ALL OF US HERE TRAVELED 
AND TOLD PEOPLE WE WERE FROM 
ARIZONA, PEOPLE KNEW TWO BIG 
THINGS ABOUT IT. 
JOHN MCCAIN AND THE GRAND 
CANYON. 
IMAGINING ARIZONA WITHOUT JOHN 
MCCAIN IS LIKE PICTURING AN 
ARIZONA WITHOUT THE GRAND 
CANYON. 
IT'S JUST NOT NATURAL. 
TO THE WOMAN WHO BROUGHT JOHN 
MCCAIN TO ARIZONA, CINDY, THANK 
YOU. 
THE HEARTS AND PRAYERS OF NOT 
ONLY ANGELA AND I, BUT OUR 
ENTIRE STATE AND NATION ARE 
WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT 
THIS MOMENT. 
ALWAYS KNOWN FOR YOUR ELEGANCE, 
GRACE AND COMPASSION AND THOSE 
QUALITIES HAVE BEEN ON FULL 
DISPLAY THIS PAST YEAR. 
YOU ARE A MODEL FOR US AND AN 
INSPIRATION. 
ARIZONA LOVES YOU, CINDY 
McCAIN. 
TO THE WOMAN THAT BROUGHT JOHN 
MCCAIN INTO THIS WORLD, MRS. 
McCAIN, ROBERTA, 106 YEARS 
YOUNG, YOU RAISED A REMARKABLE 
SON, AND WE ARE TRULY BLESSED 
THAT YOU ARE AMONG US STILL. 
WHEN WE LOOK TO YOU, THERE'S NO 
DOUBT WHERE JOHN MCCAIN 
INHERITED HIS DETERMINATION, 
RESILIENCE AND TENACITY. 
IT WAS BUILT INTO HIS DNA. 
YOU SEE IT IN JOHN'S CHILDREN 
WHO CARRY ON HIS SPIRIT OF 
SERVICE, DOUG, ANDY, MEGHAN, 
SIDNEY, JACK, JIMMY AND 
BRIDGEH. 
MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND KEEP ALL 
OF YOU. 
YOUR FATHER WAS VERY PROUD AND 
SO IS THE STATE OF ARIZONA. 
IN MAY ANGELA AND I HAD THE 
GREAT HONOR OF VISITING WITH 
JOHN AND CINDY AT THEIR CABIN. 
BEFORE LUNCH THE SENATOR BROKE 
THE ICE BY SHARING WHAT WAS 
WEIGHING ON HIS MIND MOST OF 
ALL. 
BREAKING INTO A SIGNATURE GRIN 
HE SAID MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS 
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RUN 
FOR RE-ELECTION IN 2022. 
DYING AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED 50 
YEARS EARLIER WAS NOT IN HIS 
PLAN. 
JOHN MCCAIN WAS A FIGHTER, AND 
HE CALLED ON US TO FIGHT WITH 
HIM, FOR AMERICAN VALUES, FOR 
THE IDEALS AND CHARACTER OF A 
FREE PEOPLE, FOR JUSTICE AND 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL, FOR EACH 
OTHER AND FOR THIS BLESSED AND 
BOUNTIFUL COUNTRY. 
NONE OF US WERE READY FOR THIS. 
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN READY 
FOR THIS, BUT JOHN MCCAIN OFTEN 
SAID OF AMERICANS WE NEVER 
SURRENDER. 
SO WHILE WE GRIEVE TODAY AS A 
STATE AND AS A NATION, JOHN 
MCCAIN'S FIGHT FOR AMERICA 
ISN'T OVER. 
IT'S A FIGHT ALL AMERICANS ARE 
OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE ON HIS 
BEHALF. 
AND AS WE MARCH FORWARD WITH 
THE COURAGE AND RESOLVE HE 
WOULD HAVE DEMANDED, MAY WE 
TAKE COMFORT IN KNOWING IN THAT 
FIGHT JOHN MCCAIN WILL ALWAYS 
HAVE OUR BACK. 
>>>  OUR HEAVENLY FATHER, WE 
ARE GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN 
GATHERED HERE TODAY IN THE 
ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL TO HONOR 
THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF THY 
SERVANT JOHN SIDANY McCAIN. 
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR HIS LIFE 
AND FOR HIS SACRIFICE, GATHERED 
IN THIS SPOT WE ARE ESPECIALLY 
GRATEFUL THAT JOHN MADE ARIZONA 
HIS HOME. 
MORE THAN 7 MILLION OF THY 
CHILDREN HAVE DONE LIKEWISE AND 
ALL OF THEM, ALL OF US ARE 
GRATEFUL FOR JOHN'S ABLE 
REPRESENTATION OVER THESE MANY 
YEARS. 
WE ASK FOR THY SPIRIT TO ABIDE 
WITH US AS WE MOURN HIS 
PASSING. 
WE ASK FOR AN ADDED MEASURE OF 
THY SPIRIT TO BE WITH JOHN'S 
SWEET FAMILY WHO HAVE 
SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR SO LONG 
IN SHARING THEIR LOVING HUSBAND 
AND FATHER WITH US FOR THESE 
MANY YEARS. 
SEND THE COMFORTER THAT THEY 
MIGHT BE REMINDED THAT JOY 
COMETH IN THE MORNING. 
NOW AS WE GO FORWARD, LET US 
REMEMBER THY HUMBLE SERVANT 
WITH GLADNESS AND CHEERFULNESS, 
TO ANSWER HIS CALL TO SUMMON 
THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE 
TO SEE AND APPRECIATE THE 
HUMANITY IN OUR OPPONENTS, TO 
MORE FREELY FORGIVE SO THAT WE 
MIGHT BE FORGIVEN. 
OF THIS WE PRAY IN THE NAME OF 
JESUS CHRIST, AMEN. 
>> PLEASE STAND. 
>> WE HAVE THANKED GOD FOR THE 
BLESSING THAT JOHN MCCAIN IS, 
CONTINUES TO BE FOR US. 
LET US GO NOW FROM THIS PLACE 
IN PEACE AND COMFORTING ONE 
ANOTHER IN THE SHEER KNOWLEDGE 
THAT ONE DAY WE WILL JOIN JOHN 
IN HIS HOME IN HEAVEN WITH HIS 
GOD. 
>>> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING AS 
McCAIN FAMILY MEMBERS AND CLOSE 
FRIENDS PAY THEIR FINAL 
RESPECTS TO JOHN MCCAIN AS HE 
LIES IN STATE HERE AT THE U.S. 
CAPITOL -- EXCUSE ME, ARIZONA 
STATE CAPITOL ON THE GROUND 
THERE. 
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS 
EVENT, THE ARIZONA NATIONAL 
GUARD WILL REPLACE THAT SINGLE 
HONOR GUARD WHO'S THERE AT THE 
CASKET AS THEY PAY THEIR FINAL 
RESPECTS HERE IN ARIZONA. 
WE ARE EXPECTING THIS TO BE 
JUST THE START OF A FIVE-DAY 
MEMORIAL SERVICE HONORING THE 
LATE SENATOR. 
WE HEARD SOME INCREDIBLY MOVING 
TRIBUTES. 
IN FACT, GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY OF 
ARIZONA SAYING THAT ARIZONA 
WITHOUT JOHN MCCAIN IS LIKE 
ARIZONA WITHOUT THE GRAND 
CANYON, IT'S JUST NOT NATURAL. 
I WANT TO BRING IN -- AS WE'RE 
SEEING THE SENATOR PAY HIS 
RESPECTS THERE. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CHIEF 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT 
NANCY CORDES WHO'S IN PHOENIX 
AND HAS BEEN THERE OVER THE 
PAST WEEKEND. 
NANCY, I WANTED  TO GET YOUR 
THOUGHTS THIS MOMENT. 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, REENA, THIS 
WAS REALLY A VERY SOLEMN, A 
VERY INTIMATE CEREMONY TO 
REMEMBER JOHN MCCAIN THE 
MILITARY HERO, JOHN MCCAIN THE 
SENATOR, JOHN MCCAIN THE FORMER 
P.O.W. 
THERE WILL BE TIME FOR MORE 
PERSONAL TRIBUTES ABOUT JOHN 
MCCAIN THE MAN, BUT THIS WAS 
REALLY MEANT TO RECOGNIZE HOW 
MUCH HE MEANT TO THIS COUNTRY 
AND TO THIS STATE. 
HE'S ONE OF ONLY A FEW PEOPLE 
IN ARIZONA HISTORY WHO HAVE HAD 
THE HONOR OF LYING IN STATE AS 
HE IS NOW IN THE ARIZONA 
CAPITOL. 
AND THEY SEALED OFF THAT 
ROTUNDA FOR THIS VERY INTIMATE 
SERVICE WITH JUST A HANDFUL OF 
DIGNITARIES AND FAMILY MEMBERS 
AND FRIENDS. 
CLEARLY SOME OF THE FAMILY 
OVERCOME BY EMOTION, AS YOU CAN 
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY 
NOTABLE THAT ARIZONA'S 
GOVERNOR, DOUG DUCEY, CALLED 
HIM ARIZONA'S FAVORITE ADOPTED 
SON AND NOTED THAT HE WAS 
NEARLY 45 YEARS OLD WHEN McCAIN 
MOVED TO ARIZONA. 
AND WHEN YOU THINK NOW ABOUT 
HOW INTEGRAL HE IS TO THE 
HISTORY OF THIS STATE, IT IS 
REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE. 
AS YOU POINTED OUT, GOVERNOR 
DUCEY SAID THINKING ABOUT 
ARIZONA WITHOUT JOHN MCCAIN IS 
LIKE THINKING ABOUT THE STATE 
WITHOUT THE GRAND CANYON. 
IT'S JUST NOT NATURAL, AND 
THAT'S WHY I THINK IN A COUPLE 
OF HOURS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AN 
OUTPOURING OF LOCAL RESIDENTS, 
CONSTITUENTS HERE AT THE STATE 
CAPITOL TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY 
TO FILE IN AND PUT THEIR HAND 
ON THAT CASKET AS YOU'VE SEEN 
FAMILY MEMBERS DOING JUST TO 
PAY THEIR RESPECTS AND THEIR 
LAST REGARDS. 
>> NANCY, AS YOU KNOW, SENATOR 
McCAIN HAS SPENT A GREAT DEAL 
OF TIME LABORING OVER EXACTLY 
WHAT THESE DAYS, THESE NEXT 
FIVE DAYS WOULD LOOK LIKE. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
FUNERAL, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT 
HIS INVOLVEMENT IN PLANNING 
THIS? 
>>REPORTER:  WE KNOW THAT HE 
PLANNED IT AND REPLANNED IT AND 
REPLANNED IT DOWN TO THE LAST 
DETAIL. 
WE KNOW THAT HE MET WITH SOME 
OF HIS CLOSE CONFIDANTES 
REPEATEDLY, ALMOST ON A WEEKLY 
BASIS TO GO OVER SOME OF THE 
DETAILS THAT HE CARED VERY 
DEEPLY ABOUT HIS LEGACY, ABOUT 
HOW HE WOULD BE REMEMBERED AND 
WITH WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY WITH 
THE SERIES OF MEMORIAL 
SERVICES. 
FOR INSTANCE, I THINK IT'S 
NOTABLE THAT TOMORROW YOU WILL 
SEE A GREAT DEAL OF DIVERSITY 
AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
CHOSEN TO SPEAK. 
YOU HAVE A FORMER VICE 
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, YOU HAVE A 
VERY CLOSE LONG-TIME FRIEND 
GRANT WOODS, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE 
A TOP ACTIVIST IN THE LATINO 
COMMUNITY HERE IN ARIZONA, 
TOMMY ESPINOSA. 
YOU HAVE A VERY WELL KNOWN 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ATHLETE FROM 
ARIZONA WHO WAS CLOSE WITH JOHN 
MCCAIN AS WELL. 
SO THE MESSAGE THAT I'M TOLD 
SENATOR McCAIN WANTED TO SEND, 
PARTICULARLY IN THESE TURBULENT 
TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN 
COMMUNITIES RETREATING INTO 
THEIR OWN CAMPS SUSPICION, A 
LOT OF SHARP RHETORIC, FOR 
EXAMPLE, ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND 
ABOUT BUILDING A WALL. 
HE WANTED TO CONVEY, AND YOU 
úH 
THAT WAS READ THE OTHER DAY, 
THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT 
THERE SHOULD BE ANY WALLS 
BETWEEN COMMUNITIES. 
AND, IN FACT, HE BELIEVES THAT 
HADS IMPORTANT TO BRING THOSE 
COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. 
SO I THINK THAT IS A THEME THAT 
YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR VERY 
CLEARLY AT THIS MUCH LARGER, 
PROBABLY MORE BOISTEROUS 
MEMORIAL SERVICE HERE IN 
PHOENIX TOMORROW WHERE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WILL BE 
INVITED IN AND WHERE YOU'VE GOT 
SOME CLOSE FRIENDS WHO SAY 
THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT 
SOME TOUCHING MOMENTS THAT THEY 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND SOME 
INAPPROPRIATE MOMENTS THAT THEY 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE 
AFTER ALL WE KNOW THAT JOHN 
MCCAIN WAS A MILITARY HERO, BUT 
HE WAS ALSO SOMEONE WITH A 
SHARP TONGUE AND A GREAT SENSE 
OF HUMOR WHO WAS NOT AFRAID TO 
SHOW IT, BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN 
PRIVATE. 
>> YEAH. 
WE WERE REMINDED OF THAT JUST 
YESTERDAY BY HIS FRIEND LINDSEY 
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
TALKING ABOUT HIS HUMOR AND HIS 
JOKES. 
NANCY, I ALSO WANT TO TALK TO 
YOU SORT OF ABOUT -- I THINK 
IT'S SLIGHTLY INCREDIBLE THAT 
HE'S HAVING PRESIDENT BARACK 
OBAMA EULOGIZE HIM, PROBABLY 
ONE OF HIS BIGGEST POLITICAL 
UPSETS OF HIS CAREER, HAVING 
THE MAN WHO HE FACED OFF GIVE 
HIS EULOGY. 
>>REPORTER:  RIGHT. 
AND I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT HE 
WAS TRYING TO SEND THERE BY 
ASKING BOTH BARACK OBAMA AND 
GEORGE W. BUSH WHO DEFEATED HIM 
IN HIS TWO BIDS FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE 
VERY SHARP DISAGREEMENTS WITH 
PEOPLE WITHIN YOUR OWN PARTY, 
WITH THE OTHER PARTY, AND YET 
YOU CAN COME TOGETHER AT THE 
END OF THE DAY FOR THE GOOD OF 
THIS COUNTRY. 
AND THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT 
JOHN MCCAIN AND BARACK OBAMA 
DIDN'T BUTT HEADS WHEN THEY 
WERE IN THE SENATE OR WHEN 
BARACK OBAMA WAS IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND JOHN MCCAIN RETURNED 
TO THE SENATE. 
BUT THEY RESPECTED EACH OTHER 
AS HUMAN BEINGS AND AS PEOPLE. 
AND THERE IS A SENSE WITHIN THE 
McCAIN ORBIT HERE IN ARIZONA OF 
PEOPLE WHO SHARED HIS ETHOS, 
YOU KNOW, SORT OF STAKED OUT 
THE SAME TERRITORY AT THE 
CENTER OF A LOT OF ISSUES ON 
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WHO FEEL 
THAT WE HAVE LOST SOME OF THAT, 
THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES HAVE 
TURNED INTO PERSONAL 
DIFFERENCES. 
YOU HAVE PEOPLE RETREATING TO 
THEIR CAMPS, NOT SPEAKING TO 
ONE ANOTHER. 
AND SO THE POINT HE'S MAKING BY 
ASKING BARACK OBAMA AND GEORGE 
W. BUSH TO SPEAK IS THAT THEY 
MAY HAVE HAD VERY BITTER POLICY 
DIFFERENCES, BUT THEY RESPECTED 
AND LIKED EACH OTHER AS HUMAN 
BEINGS. 
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY TO 
REMEMBER I THINK. 
>> AND NOT JUST THAT, NANCY, 
WUL OF HIS PALLBEARERS WILL 
ACTUALLY BE A RUSSIA DISDANT. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT 
HE'S CHOSEN HIM. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU KNOW, JOHN 
MCCAIN IS SOMEONE WHO TRAVELED 
ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
BUT ON MANY CONGRESSIONAL 
BREAKS YOU WOULD FIND HIM 
JETTING OFF TO THE NATION'S HOT 
SPOTS AND TO MEET WITH PEOPLE 
WHO WERE OPPRESSED ALL OVER THE 
WORLD. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE CARED 
A LOT ABOUT, AND HE KNEW THAT 
HE WAS A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN 
FREEDOM AND THAT HE COULD GIVE 
THOSE PEOPLE HOPE, PARTICULARLY 
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE HAD GONE 
THROUGH AS A PRISONER OF WAR. 
YOU HEARD LINDSEY GRAHAM, HIS 
SENATE WINGMAN, IF YOU WILL, 
THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM 
SOUTH CAROLINA SAY ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR YESTERDAY THAT 
WHEN HE AND McCAIN TRAVELED 
TOGETHER, THEY DIDN'T GO TO 
PARIS OR ROME. 
THEY WENT TO THE HEART OF 
BATTLES ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
THEY WENT TO IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN, THEY WENT TO THE 
BALKANS. 
THEY WENT TO DIFFICULT PLACES 
WHERE PEOPLE WERE CLASHING AND 
MET WITH LEADERS AND CITIZENS 
ALIKE AND TRIED TO GIVE THEM 
HOPE AND TRIED TO CONVEY TO 
THEM THAT AMERICA CARED ABOUT 
THEIR STRUGGLES. 
AND THIS IS A PART OF McCAIN'S 
LEGACY THAT I THINK WAS 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HIM. 
I THINK YOU'LL HEAR JOE BIDEN 
TALK ABOUT THAT A BIT TOMORROW 
BECAUSE HE WAS IN A LOT OF 
THOSE FOX HOLES WITH McCAIN AND 
TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WITH HIM. 
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. 
I REMEMBER THE ACTUALLY THE TWO 
OF THEM SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM 
AND SENATOR McCAIN COMING TO 
ISRAELI AND TRYING TO PUSH A 
TWO-STATE SOLUTION. 
I REMEMBER ONE ISRAELI SAY WE 
DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGE THEY'RE 
BRINGING, BUT WE RESPECT THEIR 
SERVICE AND THEIR TIME IN 
OFFICE. 
GO AHEAD, NANCY. 
>>REPORTER:  I THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO NOTE ONE OTHER 
THING WHICH THAT McCAIN HAS 
BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR NEARLY 35 
YEARS, AND THAT'S HOW WE THINK 
OF HIM. 
AND OF COURSE WE RECALL HIS 
EXPERIENCE AS A PRISONER OF 
WAR. 
BUT HE WAS ALSO THE NAVY'S 
ATTACHE TO THE CONGRESS FOR 
YEARS AFTER HE WAS RELEASED. 
SO HE KEPT HIS AFFILIATION WITH 
THE NAVY EVEN AFTER HE LEFT. 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS 
STILL VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM. 
HE SERVED ON THE ARMED SERVICES 
COMMITTEE FOR DECADES. 
HE WAS THE CHAIR OF THE ARMED 
SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST 
SEVERAL YEARS OF HIS LIFE. 
SO THE MILITARY, VETERANS 
CONTINUING TO BE INCREDIBLY 
IMPORTANT TO HIM, FOREIGN 
POLICY AND THE U.S. MILITARY 
ALIKE, MAKING SURE THAT THE 
MILITARY HAD WHAT IT NEEDED AND 
THAT'S WHY THE LAST DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION BILL WAS NAMED 
AFTER 4EU78. 
>> OUR NANCY CORDES, CHIEF 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT ON 
THE GROUND THERE IN ARIZONA. 
NANCY, WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH 
YOU THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON. 
THANK YOU. 
>>REPORTER:  SOUNDS GREAT, 
REENA, THANKS. 
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE FROM THE 
ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL IN JUST A 
MOMENT.
