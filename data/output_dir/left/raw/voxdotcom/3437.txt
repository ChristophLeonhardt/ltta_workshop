1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,050
This is Comperj.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,970
The biggest petrochemical complex in Brazil.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,760
It’s located in Itaboraí, a small city
in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,990
The multibillion dollar project launched in
2008 and the plan was to open in 2011.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,820
Thousands of Brazilians moved there to work.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,920
But it’s 2018, and Comperj never opened.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,300
Construction of the complex stopped in 2015,
after it became a symbol of the largest corruption

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,159
scandal in Brazil’s history -- Operation
Car Wash.

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,000
Hundreds of prominent Brazilians including
CEOs, members of Congress and even a former

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,060
President have been implicated.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,480
Some of Brazil’s largest companies lost
billions of dollars and the country slid further

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,380
into recession.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,120
Four years since it broke, the scandal is
still rippling through Brazil, leaving places

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,080
like Itaboraí devastated in its wake.

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,640
Itaboraí was the perfect place for one of
Brazil’s most ambitious energy projects.

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,170
It had the space for 2 refineries and a petrochemical
plant - spanning 45 square kilometers.

17
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,710
It’s also close to Brazil’s newly discovered
natural gas fields off the coast of Rio and

18
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,710
Sao Paulo.

19
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,740
When the project launched, it was estimated
that Comperj would generate 200,000 direct

20
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,840
and indirect jobs in the area.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,060
Itaboraí became a boomtown.

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,500
In 2010, 50,000 people moved there, 160 new
businesses opened, and Itaboraí’s population

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,310
grew by over 16%.

24
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,860
But 1,200 kilometers away, police broke a
case that would doom Comperj.

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
In 2012, they had this gas station, in Brasilia,
under surveillance.

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,870
They suspected it was being used to launder
money.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,810
Criminals would bring in illegal cash, report
it as gas station earnings, and then funnel

28
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,720
the cash to someone else - making the money
hard to trace back.

29
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,720
The police arrested a known money-launderer,
Alberto Youssef, and offered him a plea deal

30
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,609
in exchange for the source of the money.

31
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:31,629
But he warned his lawyers:
“If I speak, the Republic is going to fall”.

32
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,080
Youssef testified that he was laundering money,
not for criminals, but for top executives

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,420
at Petrobras, Brazil’s state-owned oil company.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
Petrobras was the largest oil company in Latin
America.

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,010
It also owned Comperj.

36
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,620
The police launched a massive investigation
-- Operation Car Wash -- and soon discovered

37
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,980
Petrobras was at the center of an intricate
corruption scheme.

38
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,400
The company used its projects to enrich criminals,
engineering companies, and Brazilian government

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
officials.

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,220
Here’s how it worked in the Comperj project:

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,099
When Petrobras needed to build the complex,
it started a bidding process for the job.

42
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,790
Typically, engineering firms would compete
for the contract, driving down the price for

43
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,780
Petrobras.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,500
But a group of these companies got together
and formed an agreement.

45
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,959
Instead of competing against each other, they
cooperated to fix prices and take turns accepting

46
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,959
projects.

47
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,760
Odebrecht, the biggest firm and ring leader
of this cartel, won some of the major contracts

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,800
to build Comperj.

49
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,100
This allowed Odebrecht to overcharge Petrobras,
and profit immensely.

50
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,180
The original cost for Comperj was about $6
billion. By 2015 Petrobras has paid at

51
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,680
least $14 billion.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,200
Odebrecht then money laundered some of its
profits through outside businesses, like the

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,180
gas station before paying bribes to Petrobras
executives and politicians.

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,700
Petrobras executives would take the bribes
as incentive to keep giving contracts exclusively to the

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
cartel.

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,879
Politicians took the bribes in exchange for
their influence over Petrobras.

57
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,820
Like Rio de Janeiro’s state governor, Sergio
Cabral, who received more than $800,000 to

58
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,559
give Comperj contracts to a firm in the cartel.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,420
This also became an important funding source
for their reelection campaigns.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,240
"Brazil's Petrobras, one of the world's biggest oil companies in a heap of trouble."

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,200
"The company's in the midst of an escalating corruption scandal."

62
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,220
After the scandal broke, Petrobras and the
engineering companies were in trouble.

63
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,700
Over two dozen executives were initially
arrested.

64
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,400
Compounded by falling oil prices, Petrobras
lost half its stock value between September

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,520
2014 and January 2015

66
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,800
Construction on Comperj was incomplete when
13,000 workers were laid off.

67
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,370
Today, in Itaborai, 40,000 people are signed
up for the city's employment program.

68
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,720
An average of 250 people line up here
in search of odd jobs.

69
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,300
Many of these unemployed residents used to
work at Comperj.

70
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,740
The massive layoffs at Comperj, affected the
rest of the city as well.

71
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,170
With Brazil's economy still trying to recover
from a recession, Itaborai has found it hard

72
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,750
to bounce back on its own.

73
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,360
Today, some limited construction is planned
to resume at Comperj after Chinese and Brazilian

74
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,810
firms partnered with Petrobras.

75
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,010
The natural gas unit is expected to open there
in 2020.

76
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,770
But this would only create about 5,000 jobs
And the problem is, the closing of Comperj

77
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,330
and devastation of Itaboraí is not an isolated
incident… it happened all over Brazil.

78
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,330
And all over Latin America.

79
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,640
Operation Car Wash successfully revealed systemic
corruption in Brazil.

80
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,330
Car Wash put ex-President Luiz Inácio “Lula”
da Silva in jail, contributed to the downfall

81
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,210
of his successor Dilma Rousseff, and a related
investigation has led to her successor Michel

82
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,560
Temer, being charged for corruption.

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,330
The ex-CEO of Odebrecht was sentenced to 19
years in prison.

84
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,500
Eike Batista, once Brazil’s richest man
was sentenced to 30 years.

85
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,650
But the same companies were funding major
infrastructure projects all over Brazil.

86
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,940
So the scandal brought many to an abrupt stop.

87
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,760
This nuclear power plant in Angra dos Reis,

88
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
for instance.

89
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,810
Like Comperj, it was halted in 2015 because
of direct involvement in the Car Wash scheme.

90
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,940
$60 million in bribes were paid out of the
project’s funding.

91
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,270
By 2016 , 11 projects were reportedly stalled
in Brazil alone.

92
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,310
It didn’t stop there.

93
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,930
The engineering companies involved worked
all over Latin America and in 2016, 17 projects

94
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,120
were reportedly stalled in at least 7 countries.

95
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,400
Like this irrigation project in Peru.

96
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,340
Where 3 former presidents have been accused
of taking bribes from Odebrecht.

97
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,580
In Colombia, this river dredging project was
stopped after Odebrecht admitted to paying

98
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,400
$11 million in bribes.

99
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,180
And in Venezuela, at least 23 infrastructure projects
have been suspended.

100
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,150
These stalled projects mean lots of layoffs.

101
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,900
A report estimates the Car Wash scandal wiped
out 500,000 jobs in Brazil alone.

102
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,020
Over four years after the scandal broke, Brazil’s
unemployment is still high.

103
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,240
Operation Car Wash is a blessing and a curse.

104
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,680
On one hand, it's uncovering systemic corruption
that has plagued Brazil for decades.

105
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,559
But on the other, it's threatening Brazil's
democracy.

106
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,489
For many, the prosecution of prominent leaders,
especially Lula, who was imprisoned at a time

107
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,320
when he was leading in the elections polls,
has revealed a bias in Brazil's judicial system.

108
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,380
The elections are now the most divisive in
the country’s history, with many losing

109
00:08:47,380 --> 00:00:00,000
faith in their political leaders.
