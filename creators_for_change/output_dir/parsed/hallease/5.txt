(train engine blaring)
(train clacking)
- This is Uncomfortable.
(upbeat music)
On the exterior, I know I seem fine.
I wake up, I work, I don't raise my voice.
The shift has been subtle,
and I see it most in my relationships.
People I once felt a
strong connection with
are falling out of my life.
The energy I once had to
entertain is now gone.
All that is left is who I am at my core.
So most of my days I spend here
at the co-working space
that I work out of.
And I do that so that way
I can be amongst people,
if you will.
A lot of this work I like very solitary
and this is kind of the only way
that I'll be able to see anyone. (laughs)
But I'm kind of weird
in that I don't really
want to talk to anybody,
but I definitely get lonely.
So it's this weird balance of
wanting to be amongst people,
but not necessarily engage with people.
Being a video producer and
then just creating in general,
it's a very solitary job.
And that's not a bad thing,
but it makes it hard.
Other people have a
hard time understanding
why you are the way you are
or why you limit your
interactions the way you do
because you gotta focus a
lot and push other things
aside a lot to achieve
what you wanna achieve.
I'm still working through that balance.
I understand now why so many
people that get into this
talk about being lonely.
And then also end up
surrounding themselves
with other creators, other
people that are doing the same
thing so they understand
that like you're not
blowing 'em off, you're
just getting work done,
or just knowing when exactly
how to check in with you
and stuff like that.
I really appreciate the
other creators that I've met
that understand this process.
(upbeat music)
Over the years I've
learned the subtle cues.
How to adjust myself, my body, my voice
to ease any tension in a room.
I've learned all too
well how to be whatever
someone needs me to be for a time.
Sometimes to play the corporate game,
or to protect my life.
We all learn how to not be abrasive.
But with this inner conflict,
with this lack of comfort
that I now have, that energy is gone
and all that is left is Hallease.
Raw and unfiltered, impatient, and unkind.
But apparently this shift,
this lack of comfort is normal.
- Yeah, it's just like one of those things
where you don't recognize how much,
how much when people say
blood, sweat, and tears,
you think that they're exaggerating.
I don't know, when I,
I was like oh my god, I
have a business y'all.
It was very like hehe,
like cute, you don't know
all that goes into it.
And then you start doing
it and you love it,
but there are moments where
you're like, what the,
what did I get myself into.
And then of course,
someone explained it to me
like the lows are lows, so low.
So crushingly low.
But the highs are just like you can't,
there's nothing that compares to it
when it's just like, it's
like I think it's probably
when parents see their
kids doing really well.
It's like yeah.
It's that feeling of accomplishment,
feeling of purpose, like
that fulfillment of purpose,
and it's really amazing.
But it's difficult because
it can be very, very lonely.
- So how have your relationships changed,
as a business owner?
- I think because I'm an Army brat,
I've always been,
I've always been okay with oh
I'll see you when I see you.
I never, that's because
that's how I grew up.
-  Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, we're just like okay.
-  That's
literally my end slogan.
-  I'll
see you when I see you.
- Like you know, like I love you,
please know that me not
seeing you like once a week
does not mean that I don't
care or anything like that.
But it wasn't really until
college where I realized,
like oh, some people are used
to just like seeing somebody
all the time.
Like in high school, I used to tell people
like the last day of
school, I'll holler at y'all
day one of class, this
is my vacation from you.
So like I've always
been the type of person
where like I'm, like I still love you,
but you know, I'll be okay.
But being an entrepreneur has kind of
heightened that, and I don't know if it's
just because of adulthood
where it's just like
this natural progression of
everybody kind of solidifying
where they're going in life
and naturally your circle of
people that you're closest to
like surrounds that.
So I've made a lot of
friends who are either
creatives or entrepreneurs
in some type of way.
Who is just like we're cool.
-  We're cool
not seeing each other.
- We're like, 'cause know that
we're doing things, right,
but then for friends that are in more,
who aren't self-employed
or small business owners,
or artists, creatives in
any way, professionally,
there's a structure
that just doesn't exist
when you're doing it yourself.
- Yeah, I mean I'm definitely,
I'm definitely like
a and I see you when I see
you type of person, for sure.
And that's the other thing too,
I feel like the only reason I even see you
when I see you is 'cause
we both work from here.
-  That's true, that's true.
- 'Cause that's the other thing too,
I feel like a lot of people forget,
you can be a villain in someone's life.
Everyone talks about
toxicity in terms of like,
oh, you know, cut out toxic
people from your life,
blah, blah, blah.
And so also I was like, always
wanna remind people too,
and you can be toxic to somebody.
I feel like--
- Be that toxic person.
- Yeah!
-  You might get cut
out, be like wait, hold on.
- Hold up a minute!
- And that's hard too.
- That's hard to take in,
but hey, if I'm toxic, you
need to drop me, drop me.
-  But at the same time.
- It hurts though.
(horn blaring)
So what do I do now?
As I watch the life I knew go
loudly crashing into the grave
and I move forward on this sturdy
but narrow path without it.
What do I do?
I guess I gotta do what
I do best and adapt
and get comfortable with
being uncomfortable.
