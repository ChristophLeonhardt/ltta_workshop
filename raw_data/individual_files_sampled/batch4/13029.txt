one slot so go ahead and check that out okay so on to the the situation over at Google so last night Google decided that they had to fire their employee the evil evil employee who suggested in a memo that Google was leftist and closed-minded which is weird since if you don't want to prove that you're leftist and closed-minded perhaps you shouldn't fire the guy who says you're leftist and closed-minded that's kind of a bad move but they fired him the Google Revolutionary Brigade has offed that employee his name's is James d'amour and this Google CEO sundar Pichai stated that the the 10 page memo had quote violated the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not okay I love when the left uses the phrase not okay because what they really mean by that is we should take you out at sunrise to the stake and light you on fire not okay is is it's there it's there under stative way of saying you're not see and we should beat the crap out of you but here is the problem just as with the rest of the media nobody read the memo nobody read the memo nothing in the memo says that women as a group are less biologically suited to being in tech there's nothing in the memo that says that okay so the media obviously didn't read the memo and so now they are simply attempting to make up what they wish the memo said because it's easier to make a case that the guy should be fired if you make up what he said so here are some of the things that it didn't say so further let me start with this here's what the memo actually said the here's what the memo said it made three main contentions first it said that Google had a leftist bias which prevented them from hearing other viewpoints obviously true because you just fired the guy who said you had a leftist bias second it said that part not all but part of the discrepancy in employment between men and women at Google was attributable not to sexism but to large-scale group differences between men and women again this makes perfect sense and is obviously true in the same way that it is true that the wage gap is largely explained in the United States by a different choice of jobs different amount of time that women want to spend in the workplace that's not to say that an individual woman can't outperform a man it's not say that an individual woman can't perform the same job a man can do depending on the job it is to say that group differences do make a difference when you are looking at aggregate when you're looking at the aggregate and finally the memo said Google should actually try to make employment easier for women in general through a series of non illegal means in other words not through hiring quotas and diversity quotas but through making it more attractive for women to be at Google does any of that sound radical to you if so you're a moron and I mean you personally I don't mean on average I mean if you actually think that's a horrible thing that's in this memo then you are a stupid person but the media are just lying about what this memo actually said so first of all they're lying about people like me who I said the memo is fine and that Google is ridiculous for having fired the guy so Newsweek ran a piece today saying the alt-right kicks back against Google the alt-right do they even know who I am I was the number-one target of the alt-right according to the anti-defamation league last year a Newsweek said I was alright yeah what was a medium there there's another there there's several other publications that suggested that I was all right okay I understand the left's desperate attempt to paint every one on the right is all right but that's just nonsense but in terms of the memo itself the memo itself does not say all the things that you're hearing in the media so today on CNN CNN ran a segment claiming that James de Maura's memo stated that women are quote unquote biologically unfit for tech there's nothing in the memo that remotely says that in fact amor says the opposite the media can't comprehend a basic basic truth okay when I say a group on average is different from another group on average that does not mean that individuals in that group can be outstanding okay and it does not mean that they can't be outstanding individuals in the group can be outstanding right the fact is if I say seven-year olds as age as in average are not as smart as fifteen year olds that doesn't mean that every seven-year-old is not as smart as fifteen year old it means on average they're dumber than fifteen year olds they're maybe a seven year old who's a genius and is the smartest and 15 year olds that doesn't mean that 7 year olds and 15 year olds have the same average level of intelligence okay but the media because they're morons collectively right I'm saying on average the media are morons not individually every one of them's a moron but collectively they're morons okay when they say that when they say that the guy is arguing the women are unfit for tech what he's actually saying is women on average are different from men not that this particular woman is different from this particular men okay here is what two more wrote he said I'm not saying not saying I love how this works he says here's what I'm not saying the media says you're saying it and Google says you're fired he says I'm not saying that all men different from all women in the following ways or that these differences are just I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership many of these differences are small and there's significant overlap between men and women so you can't say anything about an individual given these population level distributions right okay so but according to the left this means that what he's saying that every woman is worse than every man in tech okay that's clearly not what he is saying the reason that it is important to look at averages is because when you're looking at statistical averages with regard to wages when you're aggregating data you have to look at all of the relevant confounding factors okay you'd be a bad social scientist if you failed to do this he reiterates this point later in the memo he says I'm not saying that we should restrict people to certain gender roles I'm advocating for quite the opposite treat people as individuals not as just another member of their group so what he's saying is Google you said that we need to hire more women and what I'm saying to you is why don't we just hire more qualified people right why don't we just base it on their individual qualifications why does it have to be we need to hire more women you cannot simultaneously if your Google hold these two thoughts at the same time it is deeply important that we hire lots of women because women make the workplace more diverse and women are identical to men in all relevant respects he can't hold those two things simultaneously it doesn't work yeah that's what Sam Moore is saying and just to prove this he even includes this particular chart in the memo itself okay's here this is the chart okay it says populations have significant overlap and then it shows a trait and it shows two bell curves right a purple bell curve and green bell curve and it shows that the purple bell curve and the green bell curve they share some space but the the purple bell curve is shifted a little bit to the left on whatever this x-axis is okay and then he says reducing people to their group identity and assuming the average is representative ignores this overlap this is bad and I don't endorse that he's explicitly saying what they're saying that he's not saying right he's explicitly saying you can't judge individuals by group differences but group differences do make a difference when you're analyzing which of course is true right this chart is basically showing what I told you yesterday for those who missed it when I said yesterday is that what this chart shows is that women on average probably score very similarly to men with regard to tech but when it comes to the out layers when it comes to you know the the the ends of the spectrum there's a thicker end for men meaning that there are more men who are in the upper echelon than women who are in the upper echelon even if the averages are very similar ok so that's the first thing the media is telling you about this memo that is not true that he is saying that all women are unqualified for tech absolute crap doesn't say that anywhere in the memo and all that's happening here is that the media are they they've come up with a preconceived notion which is that this guy's a sexist and now they're going to work to turn him into a sexist ok second thing they say that this guy said to more said in the Google memo that he didn't say diversity is bad ok two more says literally the first words of the memo I value diversity and inclusion in fact he offers an entire section of his memo devoted to quote non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap he suggests that Google makes software engineering more people oriented with pair programming and more collaboration because women enjoy emotional connection more than men allow those exhibiting cooperative behavior to thrive make tech and leadership less stressful and allowing and truly endorsing as part of our culture part-time work right all of this would definitely make Google a more attractive place for women to work ok one of the things about about women in the workplace is that women tend to want to work part time more than men because when they have kids they want to spend more time at home with the kids get this is true of my wife it's true of women on average they do more says he believes that arbitrary social engineering of tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and women would be foolish but if there's a goal of helping the company succeed and having more women would help us do that then we should definitely try and create a culture where this thrives does that sound like someone who wants fewer women in the workplace or does it sound like someone who just wants to get rid of quotas based on sex this guy just wants to get rid of quotas based on sex but he suggests ways that you can make the workplace more attractive to women ok the other thing the media says that this guy says that he doesn't say ok and they're lying about it they say that d'amore said that sexism doesn't exist this is a direct quote from the memo quote I am not denying that sexism exists quote I hope it's clear that I'm not saying that diversity is bad that Google or Society is one unfair that we shouldn't try to correct for existing biases or that minorities have the same experience of those in the majority our larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don't fit a certain ideology and final lie that the media have been telling about this memo and it's being told by people on the left also is that the memo promotes violence the memo is in some way making people feel uncomfortable it's first of all as I mentioned yesterday when we talked about the response of the diversity and inclusion officer at Google when she says some truths are uncomfortable it's funny this guy's truths make people uncomfortable but that's bad we have to fire him but if you make him uncomfortable that's fine and he just has to go along with the program here's what he actually writes he says quote the same compassion for those seen as weak creates political correctness which constrains discourse and is complacent to the extremely sensitive PC authoritarians that use violence and shaming to advance their cause while Google hasn't harbored the violent leftist protests that we're seeing universities the frequent shaming in TGIF and in our culture has created the same silent psychologically unsafe environment so he's making the case against violence he's saying if you keep attributing motives to people without any sort of rationale then they're going to you're going to want to get violent with them more often he's basically saying what's happening in college campuses could come to Google and it has come to Google now there are a bunch of funny things about this particular story that are truly in Cristobal he is saying that he probably will file some sort of lawsuit against Google on the basis that they terminated him wrongly now it's an at-will state California's an outlaw State I believe in at-will employment I don't think employers should have to hire him yeah only is a right to be employed by Google but what he is saying is that he was actually whistleblowing on illegal activity happening inside Google discriminatory activity happening inside Google and they can't fire him for whistleblowing which is a smart legal angle okay so this is an amazing follow up story this amazing follow on story okay ready for this I love this so much so the entire claim by Google was how dare you say that women are unsuited for tech he never said that how dare you say that women on average are more emotional that's terrible you can't say that women on average are more emotional direct quote from NPR today quote a senior software engineer reportedly has been fired by Google after a memo he wrote criticizing diversity initiatives as leaked and sparked protests on social media another software engineer used to work for Google Kelly Ellis says some women who still work at the company stayed home on Monday because the memo made them quote uncomfortable going back to work so your entire case is that women are no different from men in their emotional state than women are no different from men on average and yet when a memo comes out about the differences between women and men women stay home for emotional reasons this entire story was created to make conservatives look good I mean it's a it's truly incredible like if you want to prove him right on every score that women are different from men on average that that Google has a leftist bias and they kill everyone who gets in their way all you have to do is is this this story makes it clear that all of this is true is just amazing stuff okay before I go any further and I want to talk about how this sort of mentality is now infusing all society and dividing us from one another I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over the u.s. ECA so after two years just the other day an army that was finally acquitted of homicide charges after a jury found his use of deadly force to be justified under Colorado's castle doctrine the Castle Doctrine as the law says if someone invades your house then you can defend your property in your in your life now let me tell you the story because once you hear the story you'll be surprised this everyone to trial Sergeant Michael Galvan is a 12 year army vet and he's shot an intruder in 2015 after the intruder lunged at him so why did it go to trial because left wingers say that sergeant Galvan didn't have the right to defend himself because the intruder was in his garage not his home so the Castle Doctrine didn't apply he's just in his garage okay can you believe that now we already know that we cannot rely on the screwed up legal system to ever get it right in this case it cost sergeant Galvin a lot of time money to prove his innocence just for following the law that's why you need the u.s. CCA the u.s. CCA believes everyone has the right to protect themselves no matter where they are which is why they want to give you a chance to win a brand-new gun when you activate your us CCA membership before midnight tonight does it defend my family now.com defend my family now.com tantor that's defending my family now calm they help you in case you have to shoot somebody or shoot at somebody they help

win a brand-new gun when you activate that US ECI membership again defend my family now calm yourself in your family to go over to USC CA and check it out defend my family now calm okay so this is not the only story about corporate attempts to to crack down on the right unfortunately this is becoming more and more common we saw just a couple of days ago we talked about the story with Lena Dunham trying to out a couple of American Airlines employees who are supposedly talking about how the the push for transgender children is really despicable that the push to to push children into transgenderism is gross and they wouldn't and they wouldn't involve themselves in it and Lena Dunham tweeted out and American Airlines tried to crack down on the employees and they found out that Lena Dunham is a pathological liar because that's what she is and it's just another demonstration that for the left free speech only applies to them it doesn't apply to anyone else again Google has the right to fire anyone American Airlines has the right to fire anyone who wants but if we can't live in a society where we acknowledge the differences of view generally do not mean that you should be fired then you know this is then it's gonna be very hard to live in the society now I will say there's an exception okay if somebody who's left-wing comes to work at Daily wire and then they start promulgating left-wing views I think that that's perfectly within bounds for me to say you don't represent our company you got to go but Google is not about right left Google's entire company is based around the idea of information being shared among lots of people well just because they don't like the information that's being shared that doesn't mean that you can just dump people especially because we're not even talking about in this case a guy actually writing a memo saying women shouldn't be working at Google right I mean there you could at least say hey this creates a hostile work environment there's nothing in the memo that creates a hostile work environment they just went over there skis and suggested that that's what was happening so that they could fire the guy but there is this tendency now to infuse every aspect of American life with politics so another aspect of this there's a new push for colin kaepernick in the NFL so as we talked about Colin Kaepernick was a very crappy quarterback the last couple of years he was the worst rated quarterback in the NFL last year he was demoted so that he was playing behind some other garbage quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and finally he was let go and the popular media online has been that the Colin Kaepernick was let go because he note from the National Anthem not because he's a crappy garbage quarterback so now the the Dolphins the Miami Dolphins from there a quarterback guy named Ryan Tannenbaum I believe he is he's injured and they had to pick up another quarterback so they picked up Jay Cutler okay Jay Cutler I'm a Chicago Bears man Jay Cutler is the most the most disappointing quarterback in Chicago Bears history he came in with his stellar reputation for having a gun of an arm which he does but he was not a good decision maker in the pocket and so he threw the lots of interceptions that said he was sort of a middling quarterback in terms of qbr in terms of quarterback rating he was not like on the very low end of the spectrum he was not the best quarterback in the league but he certainly was not Colin Kaepernick quality bad the Dolphins picked him up and naturally the media are now suggesting that the NFL must force some teams take Colin Kaepernick here is Shannon Sharpe over at Fox Sports 1 making this case Shannon is this a good mover bad move by the Dolphins it's a bad move yes and it's it's embarrassing quite frankly and and I get the Dolphins they were in a bye Tannehill goes down with the the knee injury the severity it seems to be as more news trickles out there's a great chance that he's probably gonna be done for the entire season so I get it so I'm just trying to figure the Jay Cutler called all 32 teams and say if somebody goes down I'm willing to come out of retirement probably not I wonder if Jay Cutler called the Miami Dolphins and says I want to play and then there's this narrative about cap says okay well he wants too much money it's amazing how the Miami Dolphins found 10 million dollars for a guy a retired guy not a guy that last threw a pass in January our retired guy you know not we don't we don't want you but here's what's the most egregious part of his gift they love Colin Kaepernick a guy that last threw a pass in January of 2017 okay so a couple of things number one it's Ryan Tannehill not Ryan Tannenbaum he's not a member of the royal Tenenbaum family but but what he says you know why are they going after Jay Cutler okay Jay Cutler retired may 5th 2017 he retired five minutes ago so this idea that he's been retired for five years and they dragged him out of retirement if they went and hired Brett Favre maybe there's a case there but this idea that it must be discrimination against Kaepernick that's preventing him from getting a job maybe what's preventing him from getting a job is two things he creates a backlash among the fanbase and - he's a really crappy quarterback but sharp is not the only person who's saying that politics ought to infuse the the gridiron Stephen a Smith is saying the same thing saying the NFL should actually cram down on teams they should find some team to cram down Kaepernick on that there's gonna be an uproar and uprising to some degree and I think that the NFL is going to feel compelled to make sure that this man has a job yes you have the naysayers and the detractors and you certainly understand that there are no african-american owners in the sport of the National Football League that a vast majority of them are what are white as opposed to Shere Khan who's a in Jacksonville and he's Pakistan is like I think I remember him being Pakistan of Pakistani rather so when you take that into consideration it looks daunting but nevertheless I do believe there's a whole bunch of people out there who are in support of Colin Kaepernick as this continues to transpire with scrubs of being picked before him you're going to see an uproar and potentially an uprising that's not something that the NFL is going to want that's not going to be good for business and I think ultimately somebody's going to capitulate okay so again it's bad for business for the NFL to manaman the kid he did the same thing I remember and with Michael Sam who is a seventh round draft pick by the NFL apparently the heads of the NFL called up all of the various NFL teams and they said you need to pick Michael Sam we need to get him on the on the field we need to have him signed by a team because he was openly game came out right before the draft I was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and so it's impossible that the NFL wouldn't engage in this again the the it's it's hilarious to watch the left spin itself in circles over dictating to private businesses what they can and must do okay so according to the left it is a must to force a religious Baker to cater a gay wedding must happen okay the government must force that also the same people will say that Google must fire somebody who disagrees with them they understand religious people must cater to people with whom they disagree but Google must fire people with whom they disagree if this all seems a little weird if this all seems like it's just outcome driven that's because it is from the left all it is about promulgating leftist values it's not really about free speech or about the ability to express yourself in any way again do I think that Colin Kapernick should be hired regardless of his stance on the national anthem I actually sort of do but I will say that there is a that his business is actually two things okay unlike Google where the guy who works at Google his job is to code that's his entire job and there's no backlash you know that really matters outside the workplace with regard to his personal views on on females you know what colin kaepernick has two jobs one is to throw a pass well which he can't do and the second is to actually draw a crowd which he has succeeded in alienating okay so before I go any further I want to get to Trump material nexton what's going on with the Trump administration I think there's a lesson that Donald Trump should be learning from this week that's a really good lesson before we get to any of that first I want to say thank you to our brand new sponsor is over at Dollar Shave Club Dollar Shave Club is the best choice it's the smarter choice you get great shave

want to move on to talk a little bit about first of all final note on all of this attempt by the left to infuse all of our businesses with politics the more they do this the more society is gonna become polarized right now we like even last year we all watch the NFL together it's something we could talk about the watercooler it is important that in America we have things that are water cooler talk it is very important that we in the United States have stuff that we can talk about with each other even if we disagree about politics and if we don't do that it actually destroys the public discourse that's what happened with the NFL with Colin Kaepernick people couldn't talk with each other about the NFL without devolving into a conversation about police brutality and race for no apparent reason right and it was very polarized along racial lines now you're seeing the same with Google you're gonna see conservatives who say okay I'm no longer gonna use Google Chrome instead I'm gonna be downloading Safari and I'm gonna use or some other browser and I'm gonna use that we're gonna be using different sources of information because Google is felt to have a bias which they clearly do there's gonna be companies that are started to fight that bias right this already exists on the right with a bunch of other web companies I mean this is why this is why the entire conservative web media exists is what ideally wire exists if the left didn't suck so much at their media job then we here at the Daily wire wouldn't exist right we have to exist to counterbalance the force of the left-wing media that's a good thing it would be a better thing if everybody was just honest in their reporting instead of lying about everything okay so in just a second I want to get to everything Trump related and a big lesson for President Trump that is coming from this week that I think is a really good lesson for President Trump if he's willing to take it but but for that are

I keep saying there's there's a lesson for president rump here's the lesson for president Trump that's happened from this week he's on vacation this week and guess what things are going really well like a lot of the news that's coming out from the Trump administration is really good you know why because Trump is and tweet and stupid crap because he's not firing and hiring he's not grabbing people like Anthony Skinner Moochie from his American cycle Psycho coq10 and bringing him in and using him as his as his as his communications guy we're not getting the the chaos every time Trump opens his mouth Trump is quiet and guess what then you see stories like this appearing in the press because guess what the media actually has to fill the time okay here's the dirty little secret about media we need content if Trump isn't providing content we will get content from somewhere else the content this week for Trump has been quite good yesterday the day before Monday there was a 15 to 0 UN resolution that was passed to create new sanctions on North Korea including China and Russia voting for it that's a major accomplishment by the Trump administration today The Daily Mail is reporting and so is the Washington Post quote the war against Isis has taken dramatic strides since Donald Trump became president with the US and its allies we're claiming swaths of Iraq and Syria in fact of all the land reclaimed by the us-led coalition since 2014 nearly one-third has been taken since Trump took office that's thanks to Trump's decision to delegate decisions and engage in a campaign of annihilation brett mcgurk the State Department senior envoy to the anti Islamic state coalition told The Washington Post since its peak in early Isis has lost 78 percent of its occupied territories in Iraq and 58 percent in Syria in total that is 27,000 square miles of territory 8,000 of which has been taken since February of this year so what should this teach president Trump it should teach him a few things one when you delegate to good people and leave them alone and don't mess around with it good things happen and this has been true at the EPA when we're cutting regulations this has been true with regard to hiring and firing or that where Trump has cut 11,000 jobs delegate to the right people and shut up okay he's on vacation right now he's disappeared the media doesn't have anything to feed off of this is why this great lie that Trump's tweets make his presidency stronger No Krum sweets make his presidency eminently weaker if you were just to go quiet and to starve the media of material then all that would happen is that the media would be forced to actually cover the news they'd actually be forced to cover the news and they'd look more and more desperate right because the left is desperate at this point listen how desperate they sound okay MSNBC I had on a guest named Dean Obadiah he's actually usually at CNN and he's a Muslim comic which is in his case oxymoronic he is he's not a funny man but he says that the Trump it's just like a swastika it's a trump swastika the word Trump is like a swastika I spoke to the executive director of this mosque earlier today and he was saying that the the relations that they enjoy with the community are generally strong you know Muslims have been in America for a long time there's a in in in in some of these areas there's slightly newer communities some of them are first-generation and and he feels that the community is not hostile toward them and that's a great thing and you saw that I I saw immediately that within hours of the attack the leaders of different faith communities standing up and saying we're with you this mosque according to a local media reports they did get some emails and hate mail before just a week ago another Muslim cemetery in the Minneapolis suburbs was vandalized with swastikas graffiti since January I've had five mosque burned down in America by arson that's according to the police we've had swastikas written on mosque we've had the word Trump painted on mosques in New Jersey Iowa New York for some the word Trump is becoming a modern-day swastika for some like why why is that becoming a modern-day swastika first of all we don't have any evidence he did that I mean maybe his suggestion here seems to be that that there are people who are alt writers who use Trump as their stand-in but like the that's that's such an exaggeration Trump is in modern-day swastika Maxine Waters the most corrupt person in Congress she said we're going to impeach Trump by December hey let her go so I believe it is possible to impeach him how long is it going to take I don't know but I give it to about December this is nothing okay I give it to December ok so that's not going to happen but the left is so crazy that this is what they're promulgating and you know what makes them sound crazy when nothing's have it makes them sound totally over the moon when nothing is happening it makes them sound bat poop okay when they when they're going crazy and Trump is just quiet it makes them sound like loon bags because they are loon bags and here's the other thing all the divisions on the right regarding Trump they go away when Trump does good things and when the left is crazy okay these are the things that unify the right if you want a unified right what you want is Trump to do positive things and you want the left to continue acting the way that they're acting at places like Google shutting down to Bay making people on the right making moderates feel threatened right that helps the right that unifies the right then you don't have to do the whole Trump as litmus test now Laura Ingraham was hosting for Tucker Carlson last night and listen to her dividing conservatives amongst themselves on the issue of Trump do you know what a liberals idea of Armageddon is no it's not a nuclear North Korea but a successful trump presidency do you know what the never Trump Republicans on Capitol Hill fear the most now it's not Isis and it's not a 5,000 point drop in the Dow but a successful trump president okay so that last statement is the one that's really dumb okay this idea that never Trump Republicans are looking for Trump to fail that's what they fear is Trump success know what they fear is losing their seats and if you're losing their seats if Trump continues to do silly things so again mr. president take a note from this week you're having a really good week okay this week has been great for you thus far I understand it's only Tuesday but it's been a great week okay that's better than it's been in the past couple of weeks okay so you ended last week on a relatively high note now the first couple of days have gone great why because you were quiet just be quiet okay and everyone will unify around the good policies your administration pushes and around the idiocy of the left you can create another victorious coalition around those two things you're going to break the coalition if you decide that you have to meddle create chaos Jabar be the center of attention all those things need to stop if you stop that every day can be like today every day can be me just doing good Trump all day that's what I would like to do I would like to that about any president okay forget whether it's Obama or Trump I wish they all the things that I want them to do right now the Trump administration is doing things this week that I want them to do and it is not being degraded by you tweeting about how Attorney General Jeff Sessions right so so why don't we just stick with that lesson that's it that's a positive lesson okay time for some things I like things I hate and then we'll deconstruct the culture a little bit so things I like we're doing sort of Cold War classics in honor of Venezuela now I guess an honor of Google since the the gulags Iraq but the book is witness is by Whittaker Chambers this is sort of the the classic of Cold War espionage thrillers it's it's not fiction right it is a nonfiction book about this this guy named Whittaker Chambers who testified against the Alger Hiss Alger Hiss was a top State Department official in the in the FDR and Truman administration's and it turned out that he was actually a Soviet spy and Whittaker Chambers knew about it and was slandered by the press and called a liar and he was threatened his life was threatened by the Communist Party and it's all about what the Communist Party actually was doing in the United States and have the left essentially lent them cover the book is witnessed it's a long books about 500 pages but it is a very quick read it is very well-written Whittaker Chambers is a terrific writer witness you can check that out over at amazon.com okay other things that I like so I have to say that I love this so much the Royal Dutch Airlines I under as I said before I don't see the need for corporations to politicize themselves but they also seem to feel the need to make everything political now which irritates me because I just want to fly my airline I don't want to hear about gay propaganda or transgender propaganda I just want to fly my airline so this is what Royal Dutch Airlines tweeted out yesterday okay for those who can't see it is a picture of three separate sets of belt buckles one is too bashful buckles one is too insertion in inserts into the buckle and one is the insert and the buckle right and they're on all of the belts themselves are painted rainbow colors and then it says it doesn't matter who you click with happy hashtag pride Amsterdam and then gay pride flag there is a problem with this particular tweet that I love very very much okay if you were to be an air turbulence two of these three buckles do not work okay if you're sitting there trying to insert the buckle into the buckle you will die while the plane becomes turbulent at 30,000 feet if you're trying to insert the insert into the insert then everything will will go dark for you as your head smashes into the overhead compartment during turbulence only one of these three teams so thank you for making the thank you for making the biological case in favor of heterosexuality Royal Dutch Airlines in your inane and stupid attempts to demonstrate to the world just how just how tolerant and diverse you are pretty incredible stuff speaking of ridiculously gay propaganda that goes wrong this gay clothing company is now trying to no joke trying to restore the swastika to its original symbolism as in elements of peace good luck with that gang so I'm gonna play this video you having play it says this is a swastika and it's a picture response against 5,000 years old it's a symbol of peace it's a symbol of love infinity of life but one day Nazism they took the swastika rotated it by 45 degrees and turn it in into hatred and turned it into power they stigmatize the swastika forever they won they limited our freedom or maybe not the swastika is coming back together with peace together with love together with respect together with freedom introducing the new swastika and then it's it's Ithaca rotated 45 degrees looking just like Hitler swastika so they didn't even have the brains to make the swastika back to its original angle right they just left it 45 degrees in half of their gear and then it says peace with swastika love with swastika Zen with swastika yes I love it so much so I hope that I only hope that one day when the gays swastika flies above companies that have fired all of the religious people that we can understand that peace love and Zen we're all with the swastika the happiest person in the world today is John Nolte who's been talking about the gays swastika for years with regard to that companies destroying religious people's lives who don't decide to participate in same-sex weddings I love it ka designs claims their intention behind using the symbol commonly associated with the Nazi Party was to reclaim the symbol to represent the LGBTQ community go for a gang just enjoy ourselves love it love it and of course everybody is like wait what-what are you doing now like say huh like what so I assume that their next campaign will be to reclaim well crematoriums because it turns out that Crimmins horn has been used for thousands of years for actual cremations like people who want to be cremated so I guess we can just reclaim Crimmins sometimes a symbol is so poisoned that you might just want to let it go the same people I assume who are in favor of the swastika I'd like to see them try to reclaim the Confederate flag next since apparently the we have decided the Confederate flag is the root of all evil in the United States so spectacular job everybody who's up with the gay propaganda this week just well done Royal Dutch Airlines ka designs you've done yeoman's work yeah well done okay time for a couple of things that I hate okay so Stephen Colbert last night spends his time going after eric bolling eric bolling has been suspended from his show the specialist on Fox News after allegations of sexual harassment against guests and here's Stephen Colbert playing high-and-mighty with with Eric Bolling the huffing poe is reporting that a co-host of the specialists and guy whose cologne you can smell to the TV eric bolling sent coworkers an unsolicited photo of male genitalia via text message oh my god whatever happened to old-fashioned courtship what a gentleman would Telegraph his genitalia here is my penis stop stop sending me your penis stop seriously stop stop bowling has been suspended while Fox News investigates but he denies the charges sort of according to his lawyer mr. bowling recalls no such inappropriate communications who doesn't recall how do you forget sending someone your bits and pieces okay so obviously Colbert and the rest of the left media oh my God look at Eric bowling it's so chair okay so I would just like to remind people and it is by the way if he's if he's texting his genitals unsolicited to people that is sexual harassment is disgusting okay now with that said Stephen Colbert took over for does anyone remember David Letterman yes David Letterman okay David Letterman told the audience openly on his show that he had sexual relationships with female staffers on his on his staff adding that he'd forked over a bogus two million dollar cheque as part of an extortion plot on the matter okay so what happened he did it for years and yet no one seemed to mind Hollywood playing hypocrite when it comes to this kind of stuff again I'm fine with ripping people up and down for sexual harassment I have no problem with that but I just find a little ironic that people in Hollywood are willing to forgo ripping their leftist colleagues engaged in sexual harassment like a little consistency would be good right I am not in favor of sexual harassment if somebody on the right does it like if Eric Bolling did it he should not have a job okay and if somebody on the Left does it they should not have a job either but I'm consistent in this this is Letterman's audience and so there's a little bit of irony to this whole shtick okay now let's do a little bit of deconstructing the culture so deconstructing the culture today ABC News and The Associated Press are pushing very very hard this new idea that young tiny children should be able to determine their own gender oh yes ABC News has a piece today it says in some ways rainbow day camp is very ordinary kids arrive with a packed lunch make friendship bracelets play basketball sing songs and get silly whenever there's a story that starts this way you know that it's gonna go off the deep end very shortly right whenever they it started off like any normal day until Bob murdered his wife and fed her to the dog right all these stories it seemed like a relatively normal place until it turned out to be one of London's graveyards but it always starts out with it starts off they packed lunch make friendship bracelets but it is unique from the moment campers arrive each morning I check in each day campers make a nametag with their pronoun of choice some up for she or he or a combination of she he or they or no pronoun at all some change their pronouns daily to see what feels right the camp in the San Francisco Bay Area mm-hmm caters to transgender and gender fluid children ages four to twelve okay so once you get to twelve I think that we can start having conversations about you know whether you are experiencing gender dysphoria at the age of four if your parents sending your four year old to a camp that is reinforcing gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria whichever term you choose to use you are doing something deeply wrong I have a three and a half year old it is insane - insane to suggest that a four year old is capable of deciding his or her sex that's utterly crazy and parents who are doing this are doing something deeply sinful something deeply nasty to their own child it is your job to guide your child this idea that your child is supposed to lead you into something like sexual identity when they have no clue what sexes have no idea what their genitals are for don't have hormones okay this is just ridiculous it's just ridiculous is this the enrollment has tripled to about sixty young campers and this is demonstrative the fact by the way this is true across the board it's from Australia it's still Great Britain every place where the transgender movement has started to push what they've seen is an enormous number the number of kids who are now looking to transition has skyrocketed dramatically now the left would say is all these people were just waiting to transition and now in societies become more accepting and you're seeing more of this behavior okay or it is possible that gender confusion can be created by environment or exacerbated by environment this notion that environment has nothing to do with sexual identity or sexual orientation or sexual behavior is just asinine it's not true okay there's been no evidence of this whatsoever according to the left sexual orientation sexual behavior gender all of those things are hardwired but sex itself is not hardwired sex itself is completely malleable this is a scientific it's actually anti-scientific and to pretend that small children four-year-olds should be going to camps where they are encouraged to revel and gender confusion is is purely disgusting it's fairly disgusting particularly since statistically speaking eighty percent of small children suffer from even gender identity disorder right actually suffer from it grow out of it by the time they hit puberty so just what what a terrible society were creating or when we suggest the children ought to be making decisions about their own sex lives but it's also ought to be abdicating on that score really really terrible and the the the article contains how a six year old Gracie Maxwell was dancing in the sunshine and a my as a Miley Cyrus song blaster from outdoor speakers the freckle blue-eyed blonde wore her hair on in a braid on one side Gracie's a boy by the way once she could talk I don't remember a time when she didn't say I'm a girl it said her mother Molly Maxwell who still trips over pronouns but tries to stick to she then it grew in intensity I'm a sister I'm a daughter I'm a princess we would argue with her she was confused we were confused living in liberal-minded bay area made it easier the Maxwells found a transgender play group sought specialists in at four year old but Gracie Grover hair dressed as a girl and eventually changed her name what what a joyous occasion I mean look at look at this kid here on the right this little cat this kid who do you think maybe six five the one on the right with the multicolored hair here yeah it's a decision by the parents to to allow this kind of this kind of stuff it's a decision by the parents to revel in this kind of stuff and make themselves feel better as parents that this kind of stuff listen I wouldn't want to be a parent who has a kid who has to deal with gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder but for me to abdicate the decision to the four-year-old is just it's it's non adult okay it's anti adult and it's anti civilization okay so when this unfortunately is going to continue because the left is fully ensconced in its own navel-gazing with regards to the new civil rights movement is created for itself it's not a civil rights movement at all it's a way of destroying childhood in a sense okay so we'll be back here tomorrow to talk about more fallout I'm sure from Google and the latest in the news i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
