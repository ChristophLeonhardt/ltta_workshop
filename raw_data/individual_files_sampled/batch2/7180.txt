schools in the UK will actually change their analog clocks to digital because apparently the students can't read them anymore they're saying that pupils sitting for their GCSE and a-level exams complain that they were struggling to read the correct time on an analog clock and they just said like they're not learning that anymore they're struggling is taking more time they struggled with a test so they want to change it to digital I'm going to take a strong stance here and I think I might be alone that I don't care if it's easier for it why do you have to tell time on an analogue clock why do people if everything else is digital if my watch and my phone and my computer is all digital why should I learn how to read an analogue tell you why my reason I should learn how to do cursive and spell check I mean come on come up well there's something specific about this one which is like has no one ever seen the pilot for Battlestar Galactica this is how the robot overlords come and get us because we digitized absolutely everything don't know how to do anything in analog format anymore and then boom robot overlords whether they come obviously yeah and Hanna I feel you it makes sense who cares on the other hand if they can't read it why don't we just take five minutes out of the day and show them how instead of lowering the bar and making us go straight down the idiocracy table well I mean why not spend that time I mean I remember learning the analog clock it takes time it takes time in the class why not take that time on fractions or learning how to balance a checkbook or treating each other with respect and having empathy I'd rather this school time be treated be spent that way they done learning how to they're never gonna write a check I love I love how split we are unless because I'm in the middle on the one hand I am so on the one hand yeah we don't use an abacus anymore either right so digital is probably easier fine let's go to digital on the other hand come on and so it later in the article it's even worse in the telegraph there's some people are saying that children are increasingly finding it hard to hold payments and pesos a little weird but I use a pencil here and here and then but like to be honest I actually notice that are gonna be more advanced in society if you can use a computer better and you're more apt that way and you don't have to use your digits this way sorry not sorry Japan's everybody I might meet with you on the analog versus digital you lose me at the Pens you gotta be able to do that anyway and then maybe even the best brother story and that's because I'm a child is that one of those schools are making the change is called Tucker Mouse two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
