2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:15,809
You and I buy star maps and drive my car around
Los Angeles

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,630
You and I buy star maps and ding dong ditch
a televangelist

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:36,083
And it's only been a week
But I know that you are mine to keep

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:49,280
You are a radar detector
I drive a thousand miles an hour, I won't

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:01:06,350
go on and on
But you are always looking out for me because

7
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:19,470
You are a radar detector, you are a radar
detector

8
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,230
You are a radar detector, you are a radar
detector

9
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,960
You are a radar detector, you are a radar
detector

10
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,470
You are a radar detector

11
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,710
You are a radar detector
I drive a thousand miles an hour, I won't

12
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,950
go on and on, and on and
You are always looking out for me

14
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,950
Hi friends,

15
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,960
So I have a long history of parade participation.

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,500
I was in a dance company In middle school
and high school, so every christmas and st

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,860
patrick’s day and something called “good
neighbor fest” in the summer I put on my

18
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,960
jazz pants and did kick ball changes and lindys
down a deceptively long parade route, to,

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,510
like, rockin’ around the christmas tree,
on loop.

20
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,720
I don’t think i ever really understood why
anyone would go to a parade, just to stand

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,000
out in weather that is either too hot or too
cold just to like, wave at the children of

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
the employees of their local bank.

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,599
However, HOWEVER.

24
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,030
I have had a change of heart.

25
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,840
I went to Brooklyn’s Pride parade last weekend,
it was my first one.

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,010
Even though I’ve been out as bi in varying
degrees for about 3 years now, I was moving

27
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,549
around a lot and New York City pride is always
the same weekend as Vidcon and it’s never

28
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:34,549
worked out.

29
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:38,060
Also speaking of Vidcon I’ll be there next
week, let me know in comments if you will

30
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,060
too.

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,379
Anyway, brooklyn pride, is not the same as
new york city pride.

32
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:48,519
Instead of giant corporations with big fancy
floats, we got the local HVAC company, and

33
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,170
a scouting troop, and a whole lot of churches.

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,540
The churches definitely got me the most emotional
as a lapsed catholic who grew up getting the

35
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,629
“hate the sin not the sinner” speech at
summer camp.

36
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,139
Well now i’ve got a sticker.

37
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,250
Try and hate me now.

38
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,409
There were cheerleaders, they were cool but
I think it was a missed opportunity to change

39
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:10,319
their uniforms from Cheer New York to Queer
New York

40
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,760
Also, there were two.

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,750
TWO! seperate all femme identified drumlines.

42
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,120
And so many good boys.

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,890
I got a rainbow bookmark from my public library

44
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,250
I put on a lot of Fenty shimmer match stix
on my face.

45
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,609
AND I got to hold hands with my girlfriend
in public without doing the whole reflexive

46
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,620
“look both ways to gut check for homophobes”
thing we all do.

47
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,489
And I got frozen yogurt after.

48
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:38,920
It was a really fun time.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,709
Pride started as a protest, and that’s an
important part of our history to remember

50
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,709
and to continue.

51
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,389
But i think sometimes as a three sport competitor
in the oppression olympics, that like sometimes

52
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,799
we’ve been through enough.

53
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,310
Sometimes we wanna fight for our cake and
eat it too, you know?

54
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,969
We deserve a little innocent, corny, harmless
fun.

55
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,769
So if you’re also celebrating pride this
year, tell me how in the comments.

56
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,450
If you liked this video, please share it with
someone else you think might like it too.

57
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:15,090
If you’re at Vidcon come see me—I’ll
be on a panel called “We’re Here” about

58
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,639
queer and marginalized identities and I’ll
also be moderating a panel called Finding

59
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,209
Your Style & Voice.

60
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,370
If I don’t see you there, I will still see
you soon.

61
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,370
Bye!

62
00:04:25,370 --> 00:00:00,000
