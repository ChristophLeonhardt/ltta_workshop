FINAL HOUR. BRIAN: I'M AFRAID IF WE STAY ON THE SHOT THE WRONG FINGER WILL POP UP AND I WILL HAVE TO APOLOGIZE. STEVE: I DON'T THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN. GERALDO RIVERA WILL JOIN US NOW. NICE TO SEE THE PALMETTO QUEEN BACK IN HER ENVIRONMENT. STEVE: LOOKS AFTER AFTER 53, 55 YEARS OF HOSTILITIES NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA ARE OFFICIALLY IN THE NEXT YEAR GOING TO DECLARE AN END TO THE KOREAN WAR, GERALDO. IT IS FANTASTIC APPARENT BREAKTHROUGH. I DON'T WANT TO BE NAIVE ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND WE HAVEN'T HAD FALSE STARTS BEFORE BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, IT WAS LITTLE "ROCKET MAN" AND THREATENING SHOOTING ICBMs AND THREATENING HE COULD REACH SEATTLE AND NORTHBOUND. HE KEPT EVOLVING, SENT MISSILES OVER JAPAN. LOOK WHERE WE ARE NOW. A FANTASTIC APPARENT BREAKTHROUGH, I KEEP MODIFYING IT I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY '80s WHEN THEY HAD A REPROACHMENT NOT QUITE AS TRAMATIC LIKE THIS. NOT CROSSING OVER THE DMZ INTO SOUTH KOREA. STEVE: THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING. IT IS AMAZING. I LOVE THEY'RE DOING TELEVISED REUNIONS OF FAMILIES DIVIDED BY THE WAR. FORMAL TREATY DECLARING END TO THE WAR. ABBY: LOOK AT TIMING, MIKE POMPEO, WE HAVE PHOTOS COMING IN THE NEWSROOM OF HIS MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN BUT ALSO PRESIDENT TRUMP, THAT MEETING JUST A FEW WEEKS AWAY. HE TWEETED ABOUT THIS MORNING. THREE TWEETS WHAT IS GOING ON IN KOREA. AFTER A FURIOUS YEAR OF MISSILE LAUNCHES AND NUCLEAR TESTING HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA IS TAKING PLACE. GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING BUT ONLY TIME WILL TELL. KOREAN WAR TO END. UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS GREAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN KOREA. FINALLY SAYS, PLEASE DO NOT FORGET THE GREAT HELP MY GOOD FRIEND PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA, GOOD POINT, PARTICULARLY AT BORDER OF NORTH KOREA. WITHOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH LONGER, TOUGHER PROCESS. THEY MENTION CHINA, THEY GET LOST IN THE CONVERSATION. THEY MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE BEHIND THE ENTIRE PUZZLE. ABSOLUTELY. MEASURED TRAFFIC ON BRIDGE BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND CHINA. PRIME ARTERY OF SUPPLIES. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE CHINESE WERE ABIDING BY THE SANCTIONS. AS THE SCREWS TIGHTENED ON KIM'S REGIME, LISTEN I CAN'T SUPPORT PEOPLE. REMEMBER THE ONE SOLDIER RAN AWAY, FOUND ALL THE PARASITES IN HIS BELLY FROM MALNUTRITION AND ALL REST OF IT. COULD BE THE SITUATION GOT SO DIRE KIM FINALLY SAID, LET'S DO THIS, OR COULD BE THE MOST ELABORATE SUBTERFUGE. COULD BE LEADING US DOWN PRIMROSE PATH. HERE IS MY NUKE. I WILL RATTLE ONE MORE TIME. BRIAN: INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THE LEGITIMATE MILITARY OPTION THAT GOT TO NORTH KOREA FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER LET THEM UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE SERIOUS ALONG WITH THE WORDS THAT CAME OUT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOUTH. HOWEVER, I THINK ABOUT OTTO WARM WARM WARMBIER AND HIS FAMILY, THEY ARE SUING THEM. MARC SHORT, THE CHIEF LEGISLATIVE ADVISOR THERE, HE CAME OUT YESTERDAY, HAD NO PROBLEM SAYING THIS IS HURT ROUSE REGIME. WE HAVE OUR ICE OPEN. IF THE PRESIDENT SAID I DON'T LIKE WHAT I HEAR I WILL GET UP. I WANT EVERYONE IN CASE YOU WERE NOT UP A COUPLE HOURS AGO, THIS WAS UNSCRIPTED MOMENT BETWEEN MOON AND KIM INTO THE SOUTH PART OF THE KOREAN DIVIDE. Translator: AND WE ARE DECLARING A NEW ERA OF PEACE, BOTH OVER THE PAST DECADE WE ENDURED THE TRAGEDY OF SECESSION BUT NOW WE ARE HERE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE OVERCAME ALL THOSE HARDSHIPS. LET GOES FORWARD STEP BY STEP FOR THE BRIGHT FUTURE TOGETHER. I SINCERELY HOPE THIS DECLARATION CAN SATISFY ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE GOT HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS FOR THE PEACE AND UNIFICATION. STEVE: THE BIG QUESTION, GERALDO, APPARENTLY THEY HAVE AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER TO DENUCLEARIZE. THE NORTH WOULD LIKE SOME, WILL GO ALONG WITH SOME LIMITS. THE UNITED STATES WANTS IT TO BE COMPLETE. REMEMBER THE RELATIONSHIP USED TO EXIST BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND LIBYA. GADHAFI WAS WELL DOWN THE ROAD TO DEVELOPING HIS OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE GAVE THEM UP BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE WEST AND WANTED IT FORMNALLIZE RELATIONS. GADHAFI ENDED UP DEAD IN SEWER PIPE KILLED BY HIS HAD OWN PEOPLE. IF HE KEPT HIS NUKES, SOME ARGUE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INSULATED FROM THAT KIND OF REPRISAL. THAT IS THE CAUTIONARY TALE FROM KIM'S POINT OF VIEW. DOES THAT MEAN HE CAN'T GO FORWARD? I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM THERE IF HE FREEZES HIS, ALREADY FROZEN, ALLOWING U.S. MILITARY EXERCISES IN THE SOUTHERN, SOUTH KOREA, SOUTHERN PART OF THE PENINSULA. HE HAS NOT COMPLAINED. IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO ME THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS HAS A VIBE OF HISTORY. THIS REMINDS ME OF NIXON-CHINA, 1973. ABBY: QUICKLY ON A HUMAN LEVEL. YOU'VE BEEN OVER THERE. THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT DIED DURING THE KOREAN WAR, BRINGING FAMILIES TOGETHER, WHAT DOES TODAY, WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SO MANY PEOPLE THAT SUFFERED? LET ME SAY AS A PROUD PUERTO RICAN, THE MILITARY WAS SEGREGATED IN WORLD WAR II. BY THE KOREAN WAR THEY WERE INTEGRATED. THE UNIT FROM PUERTO RICO WAS IN NORTH KOREA. THEY SUFFERED DEVASTATING, THEY WERE DECIMATED IN TERMS OF CASUALTIES. THIS HAS A SPECIAL RECENT FANS OF PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICAN DESCENT, THAT SACRIFICE OF OUR MARINES AND INCHON, THEIR SACRIFICE WAS NOT IN VAIN. THIS WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL. I THINK IT IS PROBABLY BRIAN: McARTHUR, GOT FIRED, WAS GOING TO DROP A BOMB ON CHINA. FOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HE TOLD TRUMAN HE COULD END THE WAR WITH FOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
