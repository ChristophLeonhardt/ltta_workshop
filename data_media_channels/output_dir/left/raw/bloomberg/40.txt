1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,840
Today’s air conditioning and refrigeration
systems essentially follow

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,099
the same principles that have been around
for about hundred years.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,000
If we continue along today’s path
then that sets us up for a future where

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,280
air conditioning
may actually become one of our single largest

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,340
sources of greenhouse gas emissions later this century.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,180
Air conditioners have become inescapable 
part of our cities.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,260
They operate thanks to refrigerants - chemicals which

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,839
when released into the atmosphere are potent
greenhouse gases.

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,160
AC units also require huge amounts of energy.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,820
The U.S. uses more electricity for cooling
than Africa does for everything.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,040
As it becomes affordable 
for millions more people,

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,740
the problems that come with AC will only get worse.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,080
Which is why scientists around the world are
searching for solutions.

14
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,950
Here at the National University of Singapore
professor Chua and his team

15
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,300
are completely rethinking air conditioning.

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,400
We need a quantum leap in air conditioning
to save energy, secondly to save our environment.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,880
What we have in the lab is next generation
of air conditioners

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,229
which is extremely environmentally friendly,
less energy intensive,

19
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,159
it doesn’t eject heat to the environment
and doesn’t need the chemical refrigerant.

20
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,539
It’s a water based air conditioning.

21
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:40,869
It requires only one litre of water to operate
for 20 hours.

22
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,420
And you can use rainwater to power up the system.

23
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,600
But there is a limitation.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,100
The air needs to be dry before you can carry
out this process in an efficient way.

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,200
And that’s why there are 
two separate stages in this AC.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,149
First it dries the air,
using membranes that filter the moisture.

27
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:01,200
Then the water inside the unit evaporates
taking heat with it.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,940
It’s close to what most of us experience
every day - sweating.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,759
This system uses 30% less energy than 
a traditional air conditioner

30
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,560
and it’s also expected to be 30% cheaper.

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,200
Crucially, it uses no refrigerants.

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,320
And although it’s not available yet, the
government is backing this project,

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,680
betting that soon it could be a breath of
fresh air for Singapore and beyond.

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,060
Across the other side of the world, one start-up
in California is looking

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,340
towards outer space to revolutionise cooling.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,980
And they’re about to test their breakthrough
in the field.

37
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,370
Right now if we measure the temperature of
our surface, it’s around 48 degrees Fahrenheit

38
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,680
and the air temperature is 60 Fahrenheit.

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,040
We’re not evaporating water and we’re
not using any electricity.

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,650
You can see we’re in a middle of a field
and it is just a thin film coating that enables

41
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,260
this cooling effect and it does this 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,240
SkyCool Systems is commercialising 
a technology that harnesses

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,640
the cold of the sky and space 
to enable electricity-free cooling,

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,160
as implausible as that may sound at first glance.

45
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,420
The way it works is it takes advantage of
a natural phenomenon

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,300
that allows a surface that’s looking up
to the sky to essentially send out some of its heat.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,540
Nearly everything on earth gives off heat
in the form of infrared radiation.

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,760
SkyCool’s panels act as high-tech mirrors
reflecting some of that heat

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,890
out to the cold expanse of space,
allowing a surface to dip below the temperature

50
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,540
of the surrounding air.

51
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,560
SkyCool’s multilayered film means that it’s
now possible to achieve even during the day.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,750
The panels could be added 
onto today’s cooling systems

53
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,460
reducing their energy use 
by as much as 20 percent.

54
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,600
The energy we use for cooling is expected
to grow six fold by the year 2050.

55
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,219
And it’s primarily gonna be driven in warmer countries

56
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,110
where air conditioning use is not prevalent today.

57
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,410
What excites us about our technology is that
it represents a unique

58
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,739
and completely different way of handling the
cooling problem

59
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,940
by taking use of a resource that's always
been there, the fact that space is cold.

60
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,680
It's almost like this has been literally over
our heads for centuries, millennia,

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
but it’s something we’ve not been able
to use as a technology.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,120
With the demand for air conditioning skyrocketing,
using water and the cold of outer space

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:00:00,000
may turn out to be the best bet we have for
our warming cities.
