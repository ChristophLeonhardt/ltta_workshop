hurricane Harvey is on the way this is for now we believe that it's going to be a category 3 hurricane could be winds of 115 miles per hour and heavy rains it's likely to hit Texas okay so let me show you some pictures of the hurricane or at least satellite pictures and so that is a gathering storm if you will that is the path it is likely to take hmm now that path is what's interesting about the story I'm going to get back to that in one second but let me show you one more picture here okay that is the level of precipitation and the strength of the storm now we don't have the Doppler 4000 here and nor am ia weatherman we could have brought in mark Thompson for this but but that's not the point of my story the point of my story is about whether this is God doing it now that sounds outrageous right but I hear from Chris service all the time whenever there's flooding or a hurricane who do they blame do they blame meteorologists no and that wouldn't be fair either do they blame climate change oh ho ho no they don't no no no no they usually blame people like gays lesbians liberals and they do it in one natural disaster after another now sometimes and especially if it hits areas where they think there is a higher percentage of liberals or gays like for example when the hurricane hit New Orleans there was very prominent right-wing pastors in the country who said it was because the gays in New Orleans now it wasn't because of the overwhelmingly conservative voters of Louisiana no no definitely not so I was curious to see now there's a hurricane coming a new one in this season where it's gonna hit and why God is upset is it going to hate gay people again and and hence the idea that it is directed towards them because God is angry at us well let's find out the u.s. National Hurricane Center upgraded Harvey to a hurricane from a tropical storm on Thursday afternoon so it's getting stronger and said it was strengthened into a category three hurricane before hitting the Texas coast late on Friday or early on Saturday so it's calming guys the storm is coming and it is getting stronger and stronger and now there's a theory out there that as the planet warms up the ocean also warms up and it actually intensifies the storms and hence maybe going from a tropical storm to a category three hurricane is exactly what would happen during climate change now you can't say that any one storm is because of climate change but again let's focus on why God might be angry here because I'm sure that that's the reason not having anything to do with climate change energy companies wait a minute including Royal Dutch Shell on a Darko Petroleum and ExxonMobil have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms in the storm's path huh how's that for a twist didn't see that coming maybe god is angry at the oil companies what did the oil companies do oh right critic climate change certainly helped to create it well is it just a couple of companies there I mean I think that's like cherry-picking like the reverence do about LGBT members during storms a Senate well let's find out more than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity there's along the US Gulf Coast and nearly the fifth of the nation's crude oil is produce offshore in the region that's a gigantic percentage of the refineries in just a small little area just the area where the Hurricanes gonna hit huh is it coincidence or perhaps justice the storm could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields in Texas that pump millions of barrels per day of crude so there's the oil fields getting hit there's a refineries getting hit there's the crude oil getting hit you start climate change and all of a sudden you get the consequences of climate change when it hits everyone else oh no big deal it was the gays who did it when it hits you all of a sudden maybe you're a little concerned now you're a little guy worried about your bottom line gas prices going up etcetera why my bottom line how about the whole world's bottom line how about when it hits everywhere you're just as concerned now look do I want people of Texas getting hurt absolutely not I don't want anybody getting hurt I don't care who they voted for or what they do what their jobs are or anything along those lines because we're not actually monsters like the right-wing are and like those insane fundamentalist preachers are now having said that man if if these oil companies it's not if they are an enormous part of the reason why climate change exists in the first place so I'm not going to shed a tear about the financial damage that it does to those companies as they have inflicted enormous financial and human damage often costing incredible amounts of lives all over the world with climate change they privatize the gains but they socialize the losses on all of us with the consequences of their actions which is a warming of the planet so those chickens coming home to roost in Texas over the weekend so I hope every human being is safe and by human beings I do not include multinational corporations especially the ones that start a climate change in the first place watch the young turks commercial free download it a stream it watch it any way you like at TYT Network comm slash join
