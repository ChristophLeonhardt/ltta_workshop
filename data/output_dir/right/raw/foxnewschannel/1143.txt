1
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:10,951
>> Laura: THE HEADLESS

2
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:11,318
HOUSEMAN.

3
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:13,753
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,922
ANGLE.

5
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:17,023
IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHETHER THE

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,859
DEMOCRATS ARE ON THE VERGE OF

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,160
BLOWING WHAT IS TRADITIONALLY A

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,528
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP

9
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:23,330
SEATS IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,565
CYCLE, YOU MIGHT BE ONTO

11
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:25,932
SOMETHING.

12
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,133
NORMALLY THE PARTY IN POWER

13
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:27,834
LOSES SEATS IN THE CYCLE

14
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,337
FOLLOWING AN ELECTION.

15
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:32,305
SO DEMOCRATS THOUGHT PICKING UP

16
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:33,773
DOZENS OF HOUSE SEATS WAS GOING

17
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:34,541
TO BE PRETTY EASY.

18
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,444
ALL THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS TO RUN

19
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:38,945
AGAINST TRUMP.

20
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,413
NATIONALIZE THE ELECTION, ON THE

21
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:43,149
HOUSE MAJORITY WOULD BE THERE.

22
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:45,218
BUT NOW, THEY MUST CONFRONT OR

23
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:47,721
TRY TO DISTRACT FROM TRUMP'S

24
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:48,722
STELLAR ECONOMIC RECORD.

25
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:51,157
NOW THEY ARE IN A DIFFICULT SPOT

26
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:52,292
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CONVINCE

27
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:53,860
VOTERS TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN

28
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,729
POCKET BOOKS THIS FALL.

29
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,531
THAT'S A TOUGH CLIMB.

30
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:00,166
BUT LET'S ASK A FEW FUNDAMENTAL

31
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:00,767
QUESTIONS HERE.

32
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:01,968
WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THE

33
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:02,836
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

34
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:06,740
AND WHO WILL LEAD IT?

35
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,307
MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRAT

36
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:08,708
CONGRESSMAN SETH MOULTON

37
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:09,476
ADDRESSED THE QUESTION ON MSNBC

38
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:12,312
EARLIER TODAY.

39
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:13,980
>> WHO IS THE LEADER OF THE

40
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,316
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

41
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:19,319
>> WHO IS THE LEADER OF THE

42
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,121
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

43
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:22,155
THAT'S WHO SHE ASKED.

44
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,524
>> DOES MY SILENCE SAY

45
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:24,925
SOMETHING?

46
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:25,792
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

47
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,060
HAVE RIGHT NOW, I DON'T THINK

48
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,932
THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT

49
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:33,600
PELOSI, ALL DUE RESPECT TO HER,

50
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,901
AND SAYING HERE IS THE FUTURE OF

51
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,469
OUR PARTY.

52
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,940
>> SO WHO IS THE FUTURE OF THE

53
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,540
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

54
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,342
HE'S ON THE STAIR.

55
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:46,479
LET ME THINK, CALIFORNIA

56
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,949
SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS >> IF YOU

57
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:51,017
HAD TO BE STUCK IN A ELEVATOR

58
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:54,521
WITH EITHER PRESIDENT TRUMP, OR

59
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,488
JEFF SESSIONS, WHO WOULD IT BE?

60
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:58,959
>> DOES ONE OF US HAVE TO COME

61
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,927
OUT ALIVE?

62
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,696
>> WHAT ABOUT NEW JERSEY

63
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:03,229
SENATOR CORY BOOKER?

64
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,166
>> WHY IS IT SO DISTURBING FOR

65
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,568
ME, WHY AM I FRANKLY SEETHING

66
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,502
WITH ANGER IS TO MARK YOUR

67
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:13,273
ASSIGNMENTS IN YOUR AMNESIA IS

68
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:14,341
COMPLICITY.

69
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,910
>> Laura: HE'S VERY ANGRY.

70
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,212
WHAT ABOUT MASSACHUSETTS ON HER

71
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:20,146
AND HER ELIZABETH WARREN?

72
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:22,349
>> MY AUNT BEA HAS WALKED BY

73
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,553
THAT PICTURE AT LEAST A THOUSAND

74
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:29,723
TIMES AND IT REMARKED THAT HER

75
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,524
FATHER HAD A HIGH CHEEKBONES

76
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:41,334
LIKE ALL OF THE INDIANS DO.

77
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:42,702
>> Laura: OR JOE BIDEN?

78
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:46,339
YES, I SAID AMTRAK JOE BIDEN WHO

79
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:49,676
IS TOURING THE COUNTRY ON A BOOK

80
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:50,143
TOUR.

81
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:51,578
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

82
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:54,514
GOD LOVE YOU, WHAT I'M I TALKING

83
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:54,948
ABOUT?

84
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:57,150
YOU CANNOT GO TO A 7-ELEVEN OR

85
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,085
DUNKIN' DONUTS UNLESS YOU HAVE A

86
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:01,554
SLIGHT INDIAN ACCENT.

87
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,123
>> I WISH YOU WERE IN JUNIOR

88
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:06,526
HIGH SO I COULD TAKE HIM BEHIND

89
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,395
THE GYM.

90
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:10,930
AND PUNCH HIM IN THE MOUTH.

91
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,165
>> Laura: I WAS IN THE CAR

92
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:15,101
EARLIER AND I WAS SCREAMING

93
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:15,735
LAUGHING WITH RAYMOND.

94
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:20,340
IF YOU ARE IN A BAD MOOD, WATCH

95
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,940
JOE BIDEN ON YOUTUBE.

96
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,941
WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT TRUMP USES

97
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:26,746
VIOLENT RHETORIC, BUT BIDEN IS

98
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:28,148
ALWAYS READY TO PUNCH SOMEONE

99
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,916
ELSE.

100
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,751
ROBERT SCHWARTZ IS REPORTEDLY

101
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,153
MULLING A MOVE INTO POLITICS.

102
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,221
>> IT CONCERNS ME THAT SO MANY

103
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:35,922
VOICES WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC

104
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:38,158
PARTY ARE GOING SO FAR TO THE

105
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:38,758
LEFT.

106
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,160
I ASKED MYSELF, HOW ARE WE GOING

107
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,528
TO PAY FOR ALL THESE THINGS IN

108
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:44,931
TERMS OF THINGS LIKE SINGLE PAY

109
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:45,799
OR PEOPLE ESPOUSING THE FACT

110
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,801
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE

111
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,835
EVERYONE A JOB?

112
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,036
I THINK WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM

113
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:52,172
ALL OF THESE FALSEHOODS AND A

114
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:54,641
START TALKING ABOUT THE TRUTH

115
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,543
AND NOT FALSE PROMISES.

116
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,779
>> OKAY BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE

117
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,147
PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS.

118
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:02,816
HAS BEEN SPEAKING TRUTH AND HAS

119
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,951
BEEN DELIVERING REAL PROMISES,

120
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:05,752
AS PRESIDENT.

121
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:07,821
NOW HE IS CONNECTED WITH THE

122
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:09,322
FORGOTTEN VOTERS THAT THE

123
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:11,591
DEMOCRATS NOW SEEK AND HE HAS

124
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,592
ACTUALLY MADE THEIR LIVES

125
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,194
BETTER.

126
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:15,161
TRUMP'S REAL CLEAR POLITICS

127
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,497
APPROVAL RATING AVERAGE IS NOW

128
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:18,598
AT 44.6%.

129
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,533
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS LOWEST

130
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:24,170
LEVEL IN 17 YEARS, AND THE RCP

131
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,138
POLITICS AVERAGE ON THE

132
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,439
DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY, THAT

133
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,042
THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN, IT IS

134
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:32,579
UP TO NEARLY 40% UP FROM 27% TWO

135
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,047
YEARS AGO UNDER OBAMA.

136
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:34,748
SO ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR THE

137
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:38,351
DEMOCRATS TO PRATTLE ON ABOUT

138
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,953
OUR ALL THESE SIDE ISSUES.

139
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:41,788
THE CABLE NEWS CATNIP,

140
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:43,757
IRRELEVANT TO THE LIVES OF MOST

141
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:44,324
PEOPLE.

142
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,059
BUT DO AMERICANS REALLY CARE

143
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,594
ABOUT WHETHER A CABINET

144
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:49,896
SECRETARY BOUGHT A USED MATTRESS

145
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:50,563
OF THE TRUMP HOTEL?

146
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:51,998
OR WHETHER JERRY KRISHNA GOT

147
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:52,665
SECURITY CLEARANCE OR THE

148
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:56,369
ENDLESS SPECULATION ABOUT THE

149
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:57,403
WHEREABOUTS OF THE FIRST LADY

150
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:58,171
AFTER SURGERY?

151
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:01,841
IF YOU ARE LIKE MOST PEOPLE, YOU

152
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,244
CARE ABOUT POCKETBOOK ISSUES.

153
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,645
YOUR SAFETY, AND YOUR CULTURE

154
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:07,580
AND DECLINE ALL AROUND YOU, AND

155
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,581
YOUR CHILDREN.

156
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:10,717
ALL THE THINGS THAT TRUMP IS

157
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:11,351
FEARLESSLY ADDRESSING AND

158
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,320
WINNING ON.

159
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,189
SO THE LEFT GRIPES AND MOANS

160
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,258
ABOUT THE ONLY THINGS THEY HAVE

161
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:20,560
LEFT TO THEM WHICH IS BASICALLY

162
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,928
THE SMALL STUFF.

163
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,730
IT'S MEANT TO DISTRACT THE

164
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,399
PRESIDENT AND LURE HIM ONTO

165
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,170
THEIR TRUTH

166
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,470
TURKS.

167
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,838
THEY WILL NEED A NEW GAME PLAN

168
00:05:31,838 --> 00:00:00,000
IF THEY ARE GETTING TO THE TWO
