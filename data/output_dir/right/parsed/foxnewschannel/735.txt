ASSUME THAT IF THEY LIKE A MOVIE
OR SONG THAT THE PERSON WHO MADE
IT PROBABLY DOESN'T LIKE THEIR
MUCH FROM THE LEFT COAST.
ROSEANNE BARR BREAKS DOWN IN
REVIVAL OF HER SHOW AFTER THIS
TWEET AND THAT VALERIE JARRETT
WAS VIEWED AS OVERTLY RACIST.
>> I HORRIBLY REGRET THAT.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING.
I REGRETTED IT BEFORE I LOST
EVERYTHING.
I SAID TO GOD, I AM WILLING TO
HAVE DONE WRONG.
>> Shannon: JOINING US NOW,
AMERICA'S RABBI AND LONGTIME
ROSEANNE FRIEND, RABBI SHMULEY
BOTEACH.
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US
TONIGHT.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Shannon: SHE WAS VERY
ALSO AND SAID SHE KNOWS SHE WILL
HAVE A PRICE TO PAY.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
COMMENTING ON THE DEATH OF
STABILITY IN AMERICA BUT MAY BE
MORE CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE DEATH
OF FORGIVENESS.
HERE YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO     WO
HERE YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO     WH
HERE YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO     WS
QUITE WELL KNOWN AND PREPARED TO
BROKENNESS AND ALMOST BEGGING TO
BE FORGIVEN FOR SOMETHING THAT
ALLOWED HER TO MAKE RESTITUTION
AND RECTIFICATION FOR WHAT SHE
DID, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE
FORGIVING PEOPLE.
AND IT WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING
WHO SAID SHE SAYS AS HER IDOL IN
THIS PODCAST AND SAYS THOSE THAT
ARE BEREFT OF FORGIVENESS ARE
BEREFT OF LOVE.
>> SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW SHE HAS
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN AND
HER FAMILY AND FAMILY MEMBERS,
AND THAT SHE'S NOT A RACIST.
SHE SAID SHE WASN'T THINKING OF
VALERIE JARRETT IN THOSE TERMS
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE
EXPLANATIONS?
>> I'VE KNOWN ROSEANN FOR ALMOST
TWO DECADES AND I'VE NEVER HEARD
HER UTTER ONE IOTA OF RACISM OR
A SCINTILLA OF BIGOTRY.
WE ALL KNOW THAT ROSEANN DOES
THINGS WITH ELBOWS THAT COULD
UPSET PEOPLE BUT I'VE NEVER
HEARD REAL PREJUDICE OR BIGOTRY.
IF YOU HAVE TO PUT THINGS IN
CONTEXT.
WHAT SHOCKS ME IS, WE RECORDED
THIS ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND WE
DID NOT RELEASE IT BECAUSE I
FELT SHE NEEDED TO REFLECT ON
WHAT SHE HAD SAID WAS VERY
VULNERABLE AND VERY VULNERABLE
AND SHE HAD TO BE COMFORTABLE
THAT IT COULD BE RELEASED.
AND IT'S MADE A VERY BIG IMPACT
BECAUSE I THINK THE MORAL
COURAGE SHE SHOWED TO TAKE FULL
EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHAT HAPPENS
BUT NOT EXCUSES AS TO WHAT
HAPPENED.
SHE HAS PAID A HUGE PRICE.
SHE GAINED NOTHING BY RELEASING
THIS INTERVIEW BECAUSE HER SHOW
WAS ALREADY CANCELED.
WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE
SO SHE IS KEEPING THE MAIN
STAYING, AND SHE WANTED TO
ASSERT HER VALUES THAT ALL
PEOPLE ARE CREATED IN THE IMAGE
OF GOD AS THE BOOK OF GENESIS
SAYS IN THE VERY FIRST CHAPTER.
>> I KNOW SHE TALKS ABOUT
REPENTANCE, REMORSE AND
RECOMPENSE.
WE'VE ALL PROBABLY BEEN THERE AT
SOME POINT IN OUR LIVES.
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE IF THIS
INTERVIEW HAS AN IMPACT AND HOW
