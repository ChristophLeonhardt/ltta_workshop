run Strikes Back and pulls John Brennan security clearance all this is epic I was watching the press conference live yesterday when Sarah Huckabee Sanders came to the podium and said that President Donald Trump is pulled John Brennan and security clearance now pulling up a list of the others clearances that he's reviewing so Donald Trump and pulled John Brennan's clearance obviously Brennan being the former head of the CIA under Obama he also has under review the security clearances of former Director of National Intelligence James clapper fired FBI director James Comey former CIA and NSA guy Michael Hayden General Michael Hayden hired FBI agent Peter Strahm fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates Bruce or who's still working at the OJ and Susan Rice the queen of unmasking this is necessary I believe these are the people responsible for the bogus investigation that led to the bogus Muller probe I believe these people this group are many of those anonymous sources you hear about the New York Times and The Washington Post and make no mistake that's why the left-wing mainstream media is losing their minds because they're losing sources CNN's beside themselves MSNBC's beside themselves now when John Brennan goes on MSNBC or NBC wherever is and he speaks it's just out now as a guy with an opinion the audience isn't saying well he was director the CIA has security clearance and we're getting inside info been revoked very publicly now he's just some guy with an opinion now the other argument Democrats are making is this this infringes on the First Amendment of John Brennan and Susan Rice and brucer let me read you the First Amendment to the United States Constitution here it is well Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or other of the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances consider myself a smart guy I can read read at multiple times but I can't find in the First Amendment is that line about being entitled to a security clearance for life if you work in the Obama administration can't seem to find that can't seem to find it because it doesn't exist because a clearance is a privilege that's issued to you by the government and can be revoked by the President of the United States all right this is silly this is all very silly what they're saying about first amendment and all this brennan overstep brennan overstep he deserved to have his clearance revoked as do these others especially Comey mccabe and struck who were fired from the FBI so i hope a thorough investigation is conducted I hope the President of the United States moves on revoking the clearances of these others and many more by the way and I want to see people I want to see people indicted for leaking classified information but most importantly now III eyes the concept of a special counsel now more than ever we need a we don't have an attorney general Jeff Sessions is useless rhod Rosenstein is corrupted we need a second special counsel to investigate the first special counsel I'm to be back with you every day bringing you these updates also check out my live show on the rebels YouTube channel to classified live won't have a show tomorrow but I'll be back with you there on Monday morning 7:30 a.m. Eastern tune in thanks so much for watching have a great weekend you
