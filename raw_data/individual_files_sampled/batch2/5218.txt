what knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign including by Paul Manafort to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign hmm I was just about to say this is an intriguing question The Times notes about this question this is one of the most intriguing questions on the list Rachel Maddow reading one of the biggest pieces of news revealed in these new questions from Bob Muller as the New York Times story was breaking just last night question is intriguing because it has a premise Bob Muller doesn't just lob Hail Marys or conspiracy theories at anyone let alone the sitting president he asked about things that might be provable and for the first time we're learning Muller's not only asking about how russians offered trump help in 2016 but whether the Trump campaign through its chairman mana 4 reached out to Russia for assistance here is that exactly question do you know about any outreach by your campaign including by Paul Manafort to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign and here's how this news continues to play out today Manta forts potential talks with Russian operatives hadn't been reported before we hadn't seen anything quite so advertised the campaign reaching out to Russian officials that issue had never been raised publicly in any of the previous stories when you're this far along in the inquiry and you're talking about sitting down with your main subject you already know the answers to many of the questions these prosecutors are not going to ask the president questions they don't already know the answers to that last point is key prosecutors don't ask questions in the dark they ask about what they think they know and remember Muller secured the cooperation of Manta forts longtime deputy Rick gates tonight as we know that he's taking more time with the cooperation of Mike Flynn mother knows exactly why he's asking this question about a potential international crime between Manta Ford and the Russians if Donald Trump does not know why mother is asking the question then is the old legal saying goes he better ask somebody join me now is David corn Washington bureau chief from other jones author of the new book Russian roulette and Jessica Levinson a professor at Loyola Law School and David I'm gonna go ahead and better ask you why all attention on Paul Manafort actually requesting Russian assistance well you know he says including Paul Manafort in the book that I wrote with Mike is Acuff we report that george papadapolis said that he was encouraged by Donald Trump in a March 2016 meeting to continue to make connections and make contacts with Russia with Moscow so this question could be keyed to something about that we do know that after well we don't know we assume that after the Trump Tower meeting that might have been further communications or speculation than might have been further communications in which perhaps Donald Trump jr. caught up the a girl Arabs the context of the Kremlin who had worked the Trump's and said how come we didn't get better dirt than you promised so there are a lot of other particular pieces that we already know that could be applied to this question of course people focused on Paul Manafort and what we do know is that during the campaign he offered assistance inside information on the campaign to a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska who's very close to Putin and he did it through a former Russian military intelligence officer named Constantine columbic now did he in this chain of communications asked if Deripaska could do anything for the campaign that may be what Muller is looking at as well but this question really applies far more widely than just a man afford well david korn the book is called Russian roulette it could easily be crossword puzzles from 2016 with all the names that your name checking some of them we know it's fine just very slowly Jessica I don't know if you want to buy a vowel but bottom line how would this questioning work from your perspective as a lawyer if you did have the president sitting there and you did pose the questions we're now seeing Lee well I think that everything we've heard is exactly right one the start with very open-ended questions and I think part of it is the initial question actually is really important in the sense that what you want to do as a prosecutor is just get Donald Trump talking because we know that that will basically be a unequivocal good thing for the special counsel and I think an unequivocally bad thing for Donald Trump but then I also think what we've heard is the follow-up questions are going to be key and every my guess is every bit of this from what Donald Trump's rambling first answers are going to be to what the follow-up questions will be has already basically been scripted by specially you you have a Led Zeppelin theory of cross-examination here which would be ramble on I guess my question for you though is I've a Led Zeppelin approach to life but you do okay well but I guess the question is if anyone watching at home is watching this and it's 2018 they might be thinking okay so you asked him did you know manna Ford asked for help and he says I don't remember that we wouldn't do that no collusion and then he'll say that eight more times and then the prosecutor says well actually here's an email showing michael cohen was told i'm saying this for the sake of hypothetical that he was and now we can prove that you know about and you were told about it and then the president says I don't remember that no collusion at what point does that get Muller somewhere well I think that actually your question about the endgame is a really important one because as you know there's a route there's absolutely an open question about whether you can indict a setting present so even at the end of those questions if he had said my goodness you're right I guess I did say that and I just lied to you I'm so sorry there's still a question at the end of the day is what is Robert wouldn't do that out of it and so I think the likely scenario is what he wants out of it is a document that would be released to the public and used by our political by the legislative branches because I don't think ultimately for Trump this ends up in an indictment I think it ends up in is there enough here to put political pressure to say now you have to go through the lines of impeach and David well I have you I'd like your response as we stitch together different segments from the show of a theory raised earlier in the hour that all of this is designed by Trump friendly allies to show Trump on television just how many tough questions there are and why he ought to really think twice about sitting down with Muller well Sean Hannity said these are dumb questions and made it seem as if Trump would have an easy time with it so I that strategy is gonna work I mean I don't I hope he's watching hope Donald Trump is watching right now but nevertheless I think a lot of the fuss out there may not encourage him or discourage in one way but remember this is a guy who really seems to have problem remembering sticking to an accurate story he told Jim Jim Comey that he hadn't spent the night in Moscow and that was just kind of a ridiculous lie to make a couple of days ago he said of course I didn't say that when of course he did so I mean I don't really know I I think in a lot of ways he's like the unreliable narrative and narrator in a you know in a movie or a book I don't know what more we'll get out of him in terms of any real information to use hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or
