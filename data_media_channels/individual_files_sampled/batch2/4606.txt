leading off our discussion now David Cay Johnston Pulitzer prize-winning journalists who found a DC report org and the author of it's even worse than you think Harry Lippmann is also with us a former federal prosecutor and Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Clinton and David Cay Johnston you've been studying Donald Trump the Trump businesses you have spoken to Donald Trump before he became a political candidate about his businesses tell us what it means that the president the president's accountant has immunity oh this is very very troubling and apparently his deal is not a full prophylactic deal it is immunity to get his testimony but every check goes through Alan why Solberg he is totally loyal he uses the phrase yes mr. Trump 1,000% that he agrees with him on things and now that he is forced to testify that he will be able to tell about the many many crimes I'm absolutely certain Donald has committed and his immunity is only federal that means that if sy Vance the demand Hatton district attorney and Barbara Underwood the New York Attorney General pursue criminal cases against the Trump's the Trump Organization and the Trump children as I think they should his testimony can be used against him as well and Harry Whitman if you've been in these situations where you're working on a prosecution and an investigation and at some point you get the accountant on your side what does that open up maybe everything and at least in the case of Alan weiselberger is david says i mean he's more than an accountant here he's more than the you know the green shade number cruncher he has been not just with Trump I mean he's been with his father he's sort of you know Robert Duvall - Al Pacino here he was with the old man in the 80s he was with Trump in the 90s when he almost went bankrupt he knows how things are done and he knows you know all kinds of sketchy details so this is huge I would say and the immunity I mean they would not be providing him immunity given his prominence and the possibility that he would have criminal exposure unless it were really important to for the overall investigation and for bigger fish and you can imagine who those bigger fish might be let's listen to what one Trump campaigner said during the presidential campaign about what it means if you are given immunity when you give an immunity that means that you've probably committed a crime Harry Lippmann did Michael Flynn have that reasonably correct yeah I mean so here's how it works they call him in to talk and he says I'm not going to talk I'm gonna take the Fifth Amendment go ahead and prosecute me and they and they have they could either prosecute them as they would have and by the way you can be sure there's a whole kind of case file in a safe somewhere that they can still use against him if it happens to if they need it or they can give him immunity and what that means is they can say to him you talk to us we will not prosecute you for anything having to do with the evidence you provide or any derived evidence from it but now you have no more Fifth Amendment right because you're not going to incriminate yourself we've promised you that you that you won't now you have to be an open book and and yes you normally he would be asking for it because he fears criminal liability and they in this case would have been giving it to him notwithstanding that they probably can make a criminal case against him because of the value he has two other targets David in the information that the prosecutors provided on the day Michael Cohen a pleaded guilty which was all the way back to Tuesday of this week it seems like longer than that they described Alan Weisen Weissenberg very clearly committing a crime in those documents because he is the one who orders that the money be paid the reimbursement money be paid to Michael Cohen that the money for stormy Daniels the 130,000 that Michael Cohen laid out for stormy Daniels weiselberger orders it paid to Michael Cohen and paid in an amount that Michael Cohen will be restored a full hundred and thirty thousand after he pays income taxes on the reimbursement money so that reimbursement money ended up being four hundred and twenty thousand dollars because they threw in a sixty thousand dollar bonus it's all there in the prosecutors description and weiselberger in the emails that they have put this down as legal expenses in the bookkeeping and that means they took it as a tax deduction on federal returns and on stake returns and it wasn't legal expenses no and I'm sure that there are many many examples like that where they have taken personal expenses in appropriate expenses and use them on the tax returns and is a general rule given the way Donald operates weiselberger may do minor things on his own but anything sensitive like this he's going to deal directly with either an instruction from Donald or a discussion with Donald which means that not only do you have a tax crime many tax crimes but you're going to have a conspiracy between the two of them and of course we have very tough conspiracy laws and potentially article 460 of the New York penal code which is racketeering could even apply because the law although intended originally for Mafia families read literally can apply to any organization like the Trump organization whose purpose is criminal activity and Harry I'm sure you knew that point long as if I could it's just that that there's a general you may have heard a general difficulty under New York law they're trying to change it with double jeopardy it specifically does not apply to tax violations so so in fact they're they would be able to to bring them in both a state and federal venue I'm sorry yeah that's it's a good point but I think the audience can understand that very clearly because the people everyone the audience files both a federal tax return and a state tax return and they are two completely different documents and so if you do something wrong on each of those documents those are two completely different crimes and Harry I just wanted to go to you on point of when we heard the the Allen weiselberger name on the audio recording that Lanny Davis released publicly on behalf of Michael Cohen you had to know then that Allen Weissenberg was looking for an immunity deal or was next in line for the FBI to talk to definitely so so while he has tried to suggest through counsel then maybe he didn't know about this you're exactly right Cowan comes to trump and he says I'm going to set this up through Allen weiselberger so we know he's there at the inception as David points out that's the potential for conspiracy liability yeah he and again like many of trumps associates who have been with him forever he's a man in his 70s a criminal conviction on taxes might be equivalent to a life sentence the pressure is enormous on both the federal and state side he really in order to talk he needed immunity and they gave it to him David Cay Johnston Harry Lippmann thank you both very much for joining us tonight really appreciate it Thanks thanks for checking out our youtube
