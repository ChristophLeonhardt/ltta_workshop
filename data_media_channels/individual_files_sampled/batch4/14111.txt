a senior official in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office is now being investigated for inappropriate behavior towards women for a bunch of self-proclaimed feminists I think they're doing this wrong quad éric gagné is a deputy director of operations in the Prime Minister's Office he's actually been working in Justin Trudeau's office since the 2015 liberal election win but he was placed on leave according to a French language TV our report in early November following a formal complaint to the PMO and allegations of inappropriate behavior directed towards women the Prime Minister's Office said that any allegation brought to the attention of the office is taken extremely seriously and in this case an investigation was immediately initiated and the person in question went on leave it is the middle of December but it sounds like this became known to the prime minister's office at least six weeks ago for a government that likes to profess its own feminist nature and its commitment to transparency they sure kept this thing under their hats until they apparently could no longer do that how does Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's lack of transparency about allegations of sexual harassment in his very own office encourage other women to come forward and be supported but hearing all this news now it actually explains a lot of ridiculous recent liberal finger-pointing with regard to sexual harassment during the month of November alone when Christopher Wilson tried to ask Environment Minister Catherine McKenna a question about site C dam and the role of hydroelectricity as a clean power source this is what happened can I get a commitment from you that you will not use that hashtag and not use that name in your articles well me personally yes but if you want to get into it right now you actually banned one of our correspondence from going to the upcoming conference in bonds so that is not true in fact I wrote a letter last year encouraging you to come because I think that you can all learn about climate change how it's really having a legitimate question about hydroelectricity I just would like a commitment that you will not call me names that you won't talk about the color of my hair that you won't make fun of me that the reason I'm asking you not to do this is because I have two daughters that there are lots of girls that want to get into politics and it is completely unacceptable that you do this calling them deniers with all the connotations of the Holocaust denial okay there is a debate on this science now if you would kindly please answer my question about hydroelectricity this is very important there are 2200 jobs on the line up in the northern part of BC as a BC you see commissioned just repeat completed their report so I'm very pleased that you've agreed that you will no longer use names that are drug Ettore to women thank you very much in terms of your question yes we all know we need to move to a cleaner future we agree that we need to look at all forms of energy that is cleaner that we understand that we need to be working with communities to find solutions that make sense that hydro is one of the solutions but we all need to be working together now in press conferences journalists asked the questions and the politicians answer so the whole thing was really bizarre to watch but the mainstream media loved it they adore this McKenna as a feminist freedom fighter with a healthy helping of victimhood narrative the entire exchange was weird and contrived and manufactured then just last week liberal MP sherry Roman Otto stood up in the House of Commons and made allegations of sexual harassment against Conservative MP James bazan look at this the member from Selkirk Interlake Eastman publicly made inappropriate humiliating and unwanted comments to me that were sexual in nature these comments have caused me great stress and have negatively affected my work environment while Roman otto wouldn't say what happened to her booze and did they were both standing for a picture and he made a flippant comment saying this isn't my idea of a threesome he said it was intended as a partisan comment about being in a photo with a Liberal Member of Parliament big deal bazaine immediately tried to apologize roman otto wouldn't allow him to do that then she filed a complaint with the chief human resources officer azad cooperated in mediation then he apologized in writing in august and officials determined that the incident did not support a claim of sexual harassment and no disciplinary action was recommended for bazaine but that didn't stop roman otto from standing up in the House of Commons and going on the record to ruin a good man who's been nothing but apologetic for a clumsy sideways halfway remark Roman Otto blew it out of proportion damaging her own credibility her making a mountain out of a molehill is selfish given what we now know about what goes on in the Liberal Party caucus and even in the Prime Minister's office you know when everything is sexual harassment nothing is sexual harassment and it makes it harder for real allegations of sexual harassment to be taken seriously allegations like these ones here rookie Liberal MP from Calgary dharshan Kang is accused of not only sexual harassment but then attempting to buy the silence of the victim in the case against him he is sitting as an independent now Liberal MPs Massimo Pichette II and Scott Andrews are kicked out of the Liberal Party caucus also because of sexual harassment allegations against them in March Liberal MP Nicola di Iorio asked Conservative MP Diane watts about her stripper pole during a committee meeting after her phone went off he's since apologised for his clumsy remark and liberal MP hunter tutu was engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with a young staffer then he broke up with her to pursue a relationship with the woman's estranged mother it turned into a violent mess he's resigned from the Liberal cabinet because of that disaster you know who didn't have a lot to say about these instances of alleged sexual harassment and alleged inappropriate behavior Catherine McKenna and now sherry Roman odd oh isn't that interesting while the Liberals were complaining about everyone else's alleged sexism during the entire month of November they may have had a predator in the upper echelons of their own party and they just weren't talking about it they were too busy fabricating a sexism boogeyman out of the entire right wing and accusing others of that which the Liberals might actually be guilty of what a bunch of real feminists going out there every day in the media and playing up their victimhood narrative while ignoring the alleged victims of those within their very midst what I do know is if there were this many instances of reported sexual misconduct complaints coming out of the class of 2015 Conservative Party caucus as opposed to the Liberals the media would be losing its collective mind and talking about a rape culture within the conservative ranks some things will always remain true if it is not a Tory it is not a story and all you have to do is claim to be a male feminist to get yourself out of any trouble for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read it is the Christmas season and yet many Christians in northern Iraq don't have anywhere to worship the birth of Christ their churches were destroyed by Isis but we are doing something to help them if you can help our humanitarian initiative to save the Christians in northern Iraq go to save the Christians calm you
