1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,979
>>LATE LAST NIGHT DONALD TRUMP
ANNOUNCED HE WOULD BE MAKING A

2
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:06,129
SIGNIFICANT AND MORE THAN LIKELY
DISASTROUS CHANGE TO THE

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,090
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH HE PUT
OUT A PRESS RELEASE FOR AND THEN

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,860
DID, THE PRESS RELEASE READ IN
PART --

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:28,100
>>IF YOU AREN'T SURE WHAT THAT
MEANS BECAUSE IT'S WEIRD SPEAK,

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,000
THERE ARE THESE IMPORTANT
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THAT GO TO

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,882
MAKE SURE THE LOWEST INCOME
AMERICANS CAN MAKE SURE TO

8
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:38,659
AFFORD THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE,
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

9
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,679
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WILL
NOW APPARENTLY COME OUT --

10
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:57,940
>>WE WILL BREAK DOWN ALL THE
REASONS THAT CUTTING OUT THESE

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,800
SUBSIDIES IS DISASTROUS, WHY
IT'S INTENTIONALLY DISASTROUS,

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,069
BUT IMMEDIATELY AT THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES

13
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,140
FINALIZED THEIR PREMIUMS FOR THE
UPCOMING YEAR IN LATE SEPTEMBER.

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,420
SOME OF THEM THANKFULLY BECAUSE
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,210
UNCERTAINTY THIS YEAR ABOUT
WHETHER THOSE SUBSIDIES WOULD

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,240
VANISH FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT,
A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE COME UP

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,289
WITH TWO SETS OF POTENTIAL
PREMIUMS BASED ON THE SUBSIDIES

18
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:27,020
EXISTING OR NOT, WHICH MEANS
THEORETICALLY THEY MIGHT HAVE

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,140
MADE SOME MOVES THAT WOULD
MITIGATE SOME OF THE DAMAGE IN

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,390
THE RISE IN PREMIUMS, BUT AT
LEAST 14 MAJOR INSURANCE

21
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,689
COMPANIES DIDN'T DO THAT, WHICH
MEANS NOW YOU AREN'T JUST GOING

22
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,230
TO HAVE A RISE IN YOUR PREMIUMS
AS A RESULT OF THIS IF YOU ARE

23
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,329
IN THAT CSR CATEGORY, YOU WILL
HAVE A DRASTIC, SIGNIFICANT RISE

24
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,979
AS THEY SCRAMBLE TO MAKE ENDS
MEET NOW THAT THIS MOVE HAS BEEN

25
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,979
ANNOUNCED.

26
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,259
>>HE DID A TRIFECTA OF DAMAGE,
WHICH I GUESS IS NORMAL FOR

27
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,159
TRUMP, AND PART OF THIS, I HAVE
TO BE HONEST, I LIKE TO CLARIFY,

28
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,790
DIVE IN AND TRY TO MAKE IT
SIMPLE, BUT I READ ABOUT EIGHT

29
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,810
ARTICLES AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW HE PULLED THIS OFF.

30
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,810
YOUR

31
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,200
PRICES WILL GENERALLY GO UP 20
OR 25%, 20% NOW, AS JOHN POINTED

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,870
OUT IT'S MONTH-TO-MONTH, IT
MIGHT BE NEXT MONTH THAT YOUR

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,100
PRICES GO UP DEPENDING ON IF IT
GOT BAKED INTO THE PRICE OR NOT.

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,260
BY THE WAY LET ME PAUSE FOR A
SECOND, THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,170
POINT, YOU WERE MAD AT OBAMACARE
BECAUSE THE PRICES KEPT GOING

36
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,170
UP?

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,570
PART OF IT WAS BECAUSE THEY
ALREADY INCREASED THE PRICES

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,650
BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S EARLIER
THREATS THAT HE WOULD DO THIS.

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,600
OBAMACARE, THE PRICES ARE UP --
BY THE WAY SOME OF THAT IS

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,290
MERITED, BUT THE OTHER PART WAS
BECAUSE TRUMP SAID I WILL

41
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,160
DESTROY OBAMACARE, THIS IS HOW,
YOU WILL NEED TO INCREASE

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,860
PRICES, THEY BAKED THAT IN, SO
GO AHEAD AND PREEMPTIVELY

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,770
GET ANGRY AT TRUMP, OR GET ANGRY
IN HINDSIGHT.

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,770
>>POST-EMPTIVELY.

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:03,870
>>TO MAKE UP A WORD THAT TRUMP
WOULD ENJOY/NOT UNDERSTAND.

46
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,500
>>THEN CLAIM HE INVENTED.

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,160
>>TO THE HEART OF IT, THE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HE SOMEHOW

48
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,530
MANAGED TO INCREASE YOUR PRICES
BY 20% AND INCREASE THE DEFICIT

49
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,710
BY $200 BILLION.

50
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,100
HOW IS THAT
POSSIBLE?

51
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,450
I KEPT READING IT AND

52
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,090
REREADING IT, BUT HE'S A
MAGICIAN.

53
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,090
IF YOU NEED SOMETHING

54
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,420
SCREWED UP ROYALLY, YOU BRING IN
DONALD TRUMP AND HE WILL FIND A

55
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,590
WAY TO DO THAT.

56
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,140
>>BECAUSE NOW THAT MONEY WILL
HAVE TO BE PAID OUT OF THE

57
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,140
FEDS, IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING?

58
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,190
>>BUT YOUR PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP
ANYWAY.

59
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,190
THE GOVERNMENT WAS

60
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,420
HELPING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES,
NOT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO, BUT

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,561
BECAUSE THAT WAS TO OFFSET THE
COST FOR REALLY POOR PEOPLE WHO

62
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,200
HAVE THIS, AND THIS AFFECTS POOR
PEOPLE MORE THAN MIDDLE-CLASS,

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,390
REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE, YES, WHO
CARES ABOUT POOR PEOPLE?

64
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,850
ONCE

65
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,290
THAT MONEY IS TAKEN AWAY
INSURANCE COMPANIES GO OKAY,

66
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,030
SINCE THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE
AFTER INCREASE YOUR PREMIUMS,

67
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,560
THAT PART I UNDERSTAND.

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,130
>>THE REASON IT INCREASES THE
DEFICIT IS HOW IT WORKS NOW IS

69
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,960
YOU RECEIVE THIS MONEY FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD

70
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,660
LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS, AND OTHER
PREMIUMS WILL BE HIGHER BUT

71
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,620
THERE'S ALREADY A STIPULATION
THAT YOU CAN DEDUCT FROM YOUR

72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,029
TAXES SOME OF THESE PREMIUMS YOU
PAY, SINCE YOU WILL BE PAYING

73
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,100
MORE, THAT MEANS YOU'LL BE
PAYING LESS IN TAXES

74
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,550
SPECIFICALLY, YOU WILL STILL BE
PAYING MUCH MORE OVERALL, SO THE

75
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,690
GOVERNMENT WILL LOSE OUT ON THAT
MONEY THEY WOULD'VE OTHERWISE

76
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,690
GOTTEN IN TAXES.

77
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,720
THE TAX CREDITS
DO IT.

78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,761
FOR ALL WE KNOW MAYBE HE

79
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:38,810
WILL ELIMINATE THOSE AS WELL, HE
SEEMS DEAD SET ON SCREWING OVER

80
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,360
HIS VOTERS.

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,740
>>THE TRIFECTA PART, THE LAST
PART, NOW THE MARKETS ARE WAY

82
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,840
MORE UNSTABLE FOR HEALTH
INSURANCE.

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,210
SOME OF THOSE

84
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,630
INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT IN
THEIR MIND WEREN'T MAKING ENOUGH

85
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,810
MONEY, NOW THEY WILL MAKE EVEN
LESS, THEIR MERCHANTS WILL BE

86
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,571
SMALLER, AND THEY MIGHT GO I'M
JUST NOT GOING TO PROVIDE

87
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,940
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE,
WHICH THEN LIMITS YOUR CHOICES

88
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,500
AND SCREWS YOU OVER EVEN
FURTHER, AND DESTABILIZES THE

89
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,610
WHOLE THING, AND THEN HE WILL
TURN AROUND AND GO SEE THAT?

90
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,770
OBAMACARE IS IMPLODING.

91
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,889
YOU MADE
IT IMPLODE.

92
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,240
IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,190
WAY OF DOING UNTOLD DAMAGE IN
SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS, AND BY

94
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,030
THE WAY LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT DOES
IT HELP?

95
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,030
NOTHING!

96
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,030
NOTHING.

97
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,220
>>IT ONLY HELPS UNDO THE OBAMA
LEGACY.

98
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,220
>>YES.

99
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,530
IN TERMS OF HOW DOES IT
HELP YOU WITH YOUR INSURANCE,

100
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,700
THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE A CLAIM,
THEY CAN'T WITH A STRAIGHT FACE

101
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,590
SAY IT WILL LOWER PREMIUMS OR
GIVE YOU MORE BENEFITS OR ANY OF

102
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,880
THE THINGS THEY PROMISED, THEY
DON'T EVEN MAKE THAT CLAIM.

103
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
THE

104
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,290
ONLY THING THEY SAY IS WE ARE
DESTROYING OBAMACARE, THAT'S IT.

105
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,440
>>I WISH WE COULD DO THE ENTIRE
HOUR ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO

106
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,810
IMPORTANT, YOU ALLUDED TO THIS
BUT WHEN I POSTED THAT THIS WAS

107
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,550
GOING TO LEAD TO INCREASED
PREMIUMS SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS

108
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,680
WHO REFUSE TO REALIZE THAT
THEY'VE BEEN HOODWINKED AND

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,040
SCREWED OVER RESPOND WITH
PREMIUMS HAVE BEEN GOING UP.

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,850
YES, THEY HAVE, BUT YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN

111
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,900
THE NATURAL GROWTH IN PREMIUMS
FROM OUR EFFED-UP HEALTHCARE

112
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,160
SYSTEM ON ONE HAND, AND THE
POLITICIAN YOU SUPPORT

113
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,450
INTENTIONALLY RAISING YOUR
PREMIUMS WITH THE STROKE OF THE

114
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,450
PEN.

115
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,740
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS,
ONE DOESN'T SEEM QUITE AS

116
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,280
NECESSARY HONESTLY.

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,400
OVERALL IT
IS EXPECTED THAT AT LEAST 1

118
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,460
MILLION PEOPLE WILL GO OFF OF
INSURANCE AS A RESULT OF THIS.

119
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,300
AND REALLY FAST, BECAUSE WE
TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER, IT'S

120
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,330
NOT THE ONLY CHANGE THAT CAME TO
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THIS

121
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,620
WEEK ALONE, THERE WERE OTHER
CHANGES A DAY AGO, WHEN WE SAY

122
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,760
THAT THIS WILL INCREASE YOUR
PREMIUMS BY 20% WE DON'T MEAN

123
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,990
THEY WILL ONLY GO UP TWENTY
PERCENT FROM ALL THE STUFF THAT

124
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,310
IS HAPPENING, WE MEAN THIS ONE
WILL RAISE IT BY 20%.

125
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,510
THE

126
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,040
LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YESTERDAY'S
CHANGE, WHICH WILL TAKE HEALTHY

127
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,260
PEOPLE OUT OF THE POOL AND RAISE
THE COST OVERALL FOR OTHER

128
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,870
PEOPLE, THAT'S A SEPARATE
INCREASE TO YOUR PREMIUMS

129
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,870
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

130
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,370
SO GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT YOUR
BILLS WILL LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR.

131
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,330
>>THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME, I
FORGOT THE FOURTH WAY IT

132
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,620
DAMAGES YOU IS THAT 1 MILLION
PEOPLE LOSE INSURANCE.

133
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,820
>>JUST FROM THIS.

134
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,760
MORE PEOPLE WILL LOSE INSURANCE
WHEN THE SYSTEM COLLAPSES

135
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
OVERALL, THAT'S JUST FROM THIS.

136
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,970
>>THERE WAS A LOT WRONG WITH
OBAMACARE, IT WAS AN INSURANCE

137
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,790
COMPANY GRAB, INSURANCE
COMPANIES WITH BIG MONEY BEHIND

138
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,440
THEM HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE
WHAT IS HEALTHCARE POLICY IN

139
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,199
THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME SO
EVEN THIS OBAMACARE WHICH

140
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,370
BROUGHT ALL THIS INSURANCE TO
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, AND THOSE

141
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,630
PEOPLE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE
WERE PROVIDED WITH THESE

142
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,580
SUPPLEMENTS, THOSE SUPPLEMENTS
ARE NOW GOING AWAY, IT WAS A

143
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,510
FLAWED POLICY BUT TRUMP HAS
TAKEN THIS FLAWED POLICY AND

144
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,630
REALLY TORCHED IT IN A WAY SO AS
TO TAKE -- AS I SAY TAKE

145
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,460
SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY FLAWED
AND TURN IT ON ITS SIDE SO IT

146
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,560
DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO SUSTAIN
ITSELF IN ANY WAY, AND WE WILL

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,910
GET TO A COUPLE OTHER ASPECTS
WHERE THE LAW FALLS SHORT NOW.

148
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:17,610
>>ONE QUICK THING ABOUT THAT,
THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT OUR

149
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,040
SITE IS HONEST SO WE WILL TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THE FLAWS OF

150
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,450
OBAMACARE, WE WILL TOUCH ON THAT
MORE, THEIR SITE IS NOT HONEST.

151
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,850
THEIR PROPOSALS WHICH ARE
DISASTROUS, THEY SAY IT'S

152
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,890
WONDERFUL, IT'S THE BEST THING
YOU WILL EVER HAVE, YOU LOSING

153
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,448
YOUR INSURANCE IS WONDERFUL,
PREMIUMS GOING UP BY 25% IS

154
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,448
GREAT FOR YOU.

155
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:40,058
THEY DON'T
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY PART OF IT AND

156
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,208
LIE OVER AND OVER.

157
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,848
AND WHEN WE
ARE HONEST EVERYONE GOES

158
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,399
EVERYONE ADMITS THAT OBAMACARE
IS BAD BUT ONLY HALF THE PEOPLE

159
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,930
ADMIT TRUMP CARE IS A DISASTER.

160
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,009
THAT'S NOT TRUE, EVERY PROPOSAL

161
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,850
OF TRUMP HAS COST PEOPLE
INSURANCE AND INCREASED PREMIUMS

162
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,379
AT LEAST FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
YOUNG AND HEALTHY.

163
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,379
AND AS I

164
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,749
EXPLAINED YESTERDAY IT'S A TRAP,
THE THING HE DID YESTERDAY, YOU

165
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:06,269
THINK I GOT BETTER INSURANCE, IT
ONLY LASTS FOR THREE MONTHS, BUT

166
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:11,119
THE MINUTE YOU GET SICK THEY
DON'T RENEW, THEN YOU HAVE

167
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,880
A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WHICH
MEANS YOU ARE SCREWED WHICH

168
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,869
MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE.

169
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:19,610
>>THAT WAS THE BIG THING WITH
OBAMACARE, THE PRE-EXISTING

170
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,949
CONDITIONS CLAUSE WAS HUGE.

171
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,360
I'VE
MET PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES

172
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,019
WERE LITERALLY SAVED BY THAT ONE
FACT, THAT PRE-EXISTING -- THIS

173
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,860
IS THE BEGINNING OF AN
UNRAVELING THAT COULD AFFECT

174
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,199
LIVES, NOT THAT TRUMP HAS EVER
MET OR WILL EVER MEET ANY

175
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,629
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE
AFFECTED.

176
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:45,860
>>ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE
REPUBLICANS IS THAT THEY KNOW

177
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,899
HOW BAD IT IS, THEY AREN'T
SAYING IT PUBLICLY, BUT THE

178
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,180
NOTED CONCERN FOR REPUBLICANS IN
CONGRESS FOR THE 2018 ELECTIONS,

179
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,100
WHY WOULD YOU BE CONCERNED IF
YOUR PLAN IS BETTER AND IT

180
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,920
BROUGHT PEOPLE LOWER INSURANCE
AND BETTER BENEFITS LIKE YOU

181
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
PRETENDED?

182
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,939
WHY WOULD YOU BE CONCERNED?

183
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,999
THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT HE DID
IT THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE

184
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:10,929
ORDER AND NOT THROUGH CONGRESS
THAT IT MIGHT LOSE THEM SEATS,

185
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,660
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SEATS
BECAUSE THE PLAN IS WAY WORSE.

186
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,149
>>IT'S NOT LIKE IF IT HAD BEEN
THE RESULT OF A BILLET SOMEONE

187
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,970
LOST THEIR HOUSE, AT LEAST IT
WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.

188
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,790
I WANT

189
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:32,569
TO BRING THIS UP, JUST THIS ONE
CHANGE, THE EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE

190
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:36,290
ON PEOPLE'S LIVES, THIS IS
BEFORE THIS CHANGE --

191
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:53,179
>>I WANT TO 
LOOK AT THAT FIRST

192
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:55,089
ONE, IF YOU DO SOME QUICK MATH

193
00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:02,100
IN YOUR HEAD YOU WILL SEE THAT
THE CSRs DROPPED THE DEDUCTIBLE,

194
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,670
BUT WHEN YOU ARE BELOW THE
POVERTY LINE THAT ISN'T JUST

195
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,690
$3400 BECAUSE IN MANY CASES YOU
WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY IT WITHOUT

196
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,690
THAT.

197
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,280
IT'S NOT $3400, ITS
BANKRUPTCY AND HOMELESSNESS, IN

198
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,800
MANY CASES IT'S DEATH, IT'S NOT
A DOLLAR VALUE, IT'S A

199
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,319
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE FOR YOUR
FAMILY'S ENTIRE LIFE, AND TO

200
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:29,559
CALLOUSLY THROW THIS OUT THERE
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF OBAMA'S

201
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,529
LEGACY, TO DESTROY IT WITHOUT
EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING THE

202
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,779
LIVES YOU WILL DESTROY IS
INCREDIBLY CRAVEN EVEN BY

203
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,529
TRUMP'S STANDARDS.

204
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:44,670
>>FINALLY OBAMACARE'S UPSIDE IS
IT PROTECTED YOU, IF YOU HAD A

205
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,040
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO DIE ANYMORE.

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,550
THAT'S A BIG DEAL, AND IF YOU
WERE AROUND THE POVERTY LINE AS

207
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,280
JOHN DESCRIBED, YOU MAKE VERY
LITTLE MONEY, NOW YOU ARE

208
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,110
WORKING POOR, YOU ARE NOT A BUM,
YOU ARE WORKING HARD AND MAKING

209
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,800
MONEY BUT NOT ENOUGH MONEY AND
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT $3400 LYING

210
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,410
AROUND, I THINK THE NUMBER IS
SOMETHING LIKE 75% OF AMERICANS

211
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,579
ARE ONLY $700 AWAY FROM
BANKRUPTCY, THAT'S UNREAL.

212
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,709
>>THAT'S ONE FOURTH OF THE
DIFFERENCE IN YOUR DEDUCTIBLE.

213
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,221
>>THAT'S WHAT I KEEP TRYING TO
EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE IN POWER, THEY

214
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,199
DON'T HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS, THEY
CAN'T UNDERSTAND THOSE PROBLEMS,

215
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,779
THEY LITERALLY DON'T BELIEVE
THOSE PROBLEMS, THEN THEY WONDER

216
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,989
WHY PEOPLE ARE ANGRY.

217
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:31,679
SO TRUMP
IS PLAYING WITH YOUR LIVES, BUT

218
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,999
AS GOOD AS THOSE PROVISIONS IN
OBAMACARE ARE, MY GOD, DID THEY

219
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:39,160
MAKE THEM COMPLICATED.

220
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,899
MEDICARE
IS LOWER PREMIUMS, HIGHER

221
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,790
BENEFITS, COVERS EVERYONE.

222
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,600
IT
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLICATED,

223
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,910
JUST DO MEDICARE FOR ALL.

224
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,660
POLITICALLY IT HELPS YOU 60%, AS

225
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,251
TRUMP IS CHIPPING AWAY AT
OBAMACARE AND TRYING TO DESTROY

226
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:59,930
AND DISMANTLE IT ONE BY ONE,
DEMOCRATS, THIS IS THE TIME.

227
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,819
THEY ARE SO SCARED, SOMETIMES
THEY ARE SO PATHETIC, THERE ARE

228
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,809
ALWAYS ARTICLES LIKE BERNIE
SANDERS, HE IS PROPOSING IT, AND

229
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:15,860
NOW SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
TO PRETEND TO BE IN FAVOR OF IT

230
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,670
BUT IT GIVES REPUBLICANS
AMMUNITION TO COUNTERATTACK.

231
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,959
>>THEY ATTACKED YOU.

232
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,119
>>FIRST OF ALL REPUBLICANS
ALWAYS ATTACK.

233
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,499
SECOND OF ALL

234
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,749
THEY ARE DESTROYING HEALTHCARE,
THIRD OF ALL THEY ARE

235
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:35,139
COUNTERATTACKING ON A POSITION
WHERE YOU HAVE 60% POPULARITY.

236
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:42,069
FOR GOD'S SAKE TAKE ACTION TO
FIX IT, THE WAY TO FIX IT IS NOT

237
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:44,339
TO MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED,
IT'S TO GIVE US MEDICARE FOR

238
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,579
ALL, AND I PROMISE YOU THAT IF
TRUMP DID ANYTHING DECENT LIKE

239
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,800
FOR EXAMPLE PROMISED TO TAKE
AWAY THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T

240
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,019
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES AND
MEDICARE, THAT'S PART OF

241
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:01,079
OBAMACARE, IT'S AN OUTRAGE, IT'S
TOTALLY WRONG, BUSH HAD DONE

242
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:05,440
THE SAME THING OBAMA SAID HE
WOULD STOP IT AND HE DIDN'T,

243
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,489
TRUMP SAID HE WOULD STOP IT AND
HE DIDN'T, THEY ARE ALL BOUGHT

244
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:12,679
BY THESE DRUG COMPANIES AND IT'S
GROSS, IF TRUMP KILLED THAT PART

245
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,559
OF OBAMACARE I WOULD'VE LOVED
IT.

246
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,339
>>THAT ONE PART.

247
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,989
>>THAT ONE PART.

248
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:22,860
BUT THAT WOULD
SAVE US UNTOLD BILLIONS OF

249
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,300
DOLLARS, MAYBE EVEN TRILLIONS,
IT'S A GIANT PART OF THE

250
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,499
EQUATION.

251
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,490
AND IT'S A MONOPOLY
THEY DON'T DESERVE.

252
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,490
BUT TRUMP OF

253
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,829
COURSE DIDN'T DO THE ONE THING
THAT COULD HELP EVEN THOUGH HE

254
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:36,929
PROMISED IT, HE DID THE OPPOSITE
AND SCREWED YOU OVER ON

255
00:14:36,929 --> 00:00:00,000
YOUR INSURANCE.
