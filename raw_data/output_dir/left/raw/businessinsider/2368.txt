1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,490
welcome back we're going to just jump

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,460
right into

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,930
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob from Boise</font>

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,869
who asks all your sources within a 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> l</font>

5
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,330
still with the company if so are they

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,950
taking the package and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,640
hills so I've got people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are doing</font>

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,460
both so some are saying you know AOL is

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,900
just not the company for me they're

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,329
obviously making a big push towards

11
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,460
being this<font color="#E5E5E5"> media company I've been here</font>

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,670
15 years I'm not I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on you know I</font>

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to work for an access company it's</font>

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
just entirely to recovery so they're

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,980
like I'm out here other people you know

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,180
I'm a journalist so I know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,710
journalists and there's a few working

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,800
very well and so they're like you know

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,059
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this they're they're embracing</font>

20
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:54,789
me this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> future and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um and there</font>

21
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,429
are people who who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are at I have helped</font>

22
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:58,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">shape the strategies of course they're</font>

23
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,239
staying so it's a very dancer and I just

24
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,649
think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are realizing that AOL is a</font>

25
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:03,789
different company that it used to be and

26
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,770
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great opportunity to leave</font>

27
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,740
if it's not for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vicki asks the</font>

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,780
online space can feel like overkill with

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,909
so many websites offering the same kind

30
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of services and experiences if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

31
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,220
shape the digital landscape for 2010

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,560
which web startups would you choose to

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,869
succeed and why so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font>

34
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">shaping the digital landscape I don't</font>

35
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,420
know about that but I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that one</font>

36
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,759
startup that I wish more people outside

37
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,250
of the digital space would use are ones

38
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,229
like Foursquare or gowalla and that's

39
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,450
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just find them so useful you</font>

40
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,460
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday and you forgot to make</font>

41
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,869
plans you know you're on these people

42
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:42,880
who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just those things by the</font>

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,670
seat of your pants and so I it's great

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,469
to like look at your iphone and say oh

45
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,240
this person's at this bar as persons of

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,979
that bar<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sort of just make social</font>

47
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,049
decisions based on that so Foursquare or

48
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,049
its up its its rival that's doing really

49
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,880
well and just got a big round from

50
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">greylock gowalla so Logan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> item which is</font>

51
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,670
media mogul backwards asks he rejoins us

52
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,800
to ask or she rejoins us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask with</font>

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,980
Jack Dorsey square being the talk of the

54
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,470
tech media crowd lately do you think

55
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,410
it's overhyped I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

56
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,200
fair I mean twitter is such a huge huge

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,930
story in itself that anybody associated

58
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,780
with it is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,760
a lot of hype and and I heard that this

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,740
is true amongst the people with the

61
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,600
money as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,240
hottest angel deals that has gone down

63
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,069
at a long time people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were fighting over</font>

64
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,569
it and eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> khosla ventures walked</font>

65
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,060
away with a deal I definitely overhyped

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,250
it but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time it's exciting to</font>

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">see a startup that is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

68
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,540
solve a business problem you know how

69
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,680
great would it be to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hot dog</font>

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,480
vendor and just swipe and pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your</font>

71
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,410
credit card because he's holding an

72
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,580
iphone at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the overhype a</font>

73
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,590
factor is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hot dog vendors don't</font>

74
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,150
want to pay credit card fees and I think

75
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,560
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them also probably don't like</font>

76
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,450
paying taxes and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why they</font>

77
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't accept credit cards that because</font>

78
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,040
they have to report that there it makes

79
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it much harder just to skip that if you</font>

80
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,280
have credit card transactions glass

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,980
hammer asks what three gadget gifts

82
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,450
would you recommend for sixty dollars

83
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,890
unless gift cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't count direct</font>

84
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we had a list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten things for</font>

85
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,140
iphone owners to buy gifts for those

86
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,840
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> people so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would recommend</font>

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,209
looking at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you have</font>

88
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,220
a smartphone such as a blackberry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,870
you're prone to dropping them all the

90
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,610
time it's really nice to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case and</font>

91
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,510
those run about 30 bucks also nike makes

92
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,070
this really cool accessory for iphone

93
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,230
ipod owners where you can actually

94
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,900
attach a gadget to your shoe and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

95
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,090
see how long you ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> through your pace</font>

96
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,220
was tempo and stuff like that that's

97
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,780
like I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty bucks and then</font>

98
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,299
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this weird sort of filter</font>

99
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,269
you can put on your on your camera your

100
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,910
camera phone and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like you</font>

101
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,010
can make it so there's three people in

102
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the picture when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're we used to be</font>

103
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,950
one sort of those are some fun stuff

104
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,690
that's 15 bucks but it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

105
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">gadgets for under sixty dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

108
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,140

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,220
is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I have a question</font>
