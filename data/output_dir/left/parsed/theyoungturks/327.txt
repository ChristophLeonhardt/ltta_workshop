As more victims come out against
Brett Kavanaugh,
conservatives are trying out all the same
tactics that they have in a past.
Like, having him on Fox News for a puff piece
where he even went as far as to say
he was a virgin. And this morning
my problematic fav Tomi is back
to talk about it!
I think all of us who watched
that interview last night
couldn’t help but
feel for the guy.
Once again, we arrived at
‘he said, she said’ situation.
And look, I'm not saying
every accusation is the same,
I'm not saying every instance
of sexual misconduct is the same.
But in this case you are actively
making a choice to believe
one side over the other.
And you can’t even argue that
the victim came out of nowhere
to “ruin this person.”
But what’s happening right now is
not only a left wing conspiracy,
but it’s just wrong from a human
level Claiming this is a left
wing conspiracy is kind of lazy,
especially since Dianne Feinstein
didn’t originally reveal this information,
it was the Intercept that revealed it.
And especially since every other
attempt to smear the victim or
portray her as biased was
disproven fairly quickly.
Also you really can’t make a case
that this was a last second
attempt, unless you really think
Dr. Ford had a vendetta against
Kavanaugh for decades for some
reason. Since she mentioned this
incident to her therapist in the past,
long before Kavanaugh was
the SCOTUS nominee.
And the people who say:
‘What if it was your daughter?’
That's a great point. But I also go back at
them and say, "What if it was your son?"
Again, do false accusations exist?
Sure.
Could they be damaging
for a person’s future?
In some instances, yes.
But false accusations make up
around 2% of the overall charges.
Especially when you consider
that around 40% of the sexual assaults
go unreported, it’s like choosing
the side that’s the victim 2% of the time
as opposed to the 98% – also
this assumes that men are
exclusively the perpetrators and
never the victims –
which also isn’t true.
But go on.
What does Tomi has to say about this?
I will remind those so vocal on
the left, especially the men,
that are so vocal on the left to
denounce Kavanaugh and to talk
about the survivor and to talk
about the allegations as if
they’re gospel truth – I will
remind them that it only takes
one person to come out against them,
from way back in their past
or in their present –
and their lives, their career,
their families could be ruined.
Look, you know I make a lot of jokes,
and I say dumb shit all the time.
I've certainly said dumb
shit in the past and I probably
going to continue to say dumb
shit in the foreseeable future.
I’ve even also warned against
the weaponization of #MeToo,
especially by bad faith virtue
signalers on the right.
So it’s important to analyze everything
on a case by case basis.
But no one is trying to eliminate due
process, and they’re certainly
not trying to do that here.
These right wing attacks aren’t
about arriving at the truth,
or due process.
Republicans don’t
want due process,
they want silence.
After all, Dr. Christine Ford is willing to
testify, despite the barrage of attacks
from right wing figures.
The only other principle
involved in the incident who’s
refusing to testify: Mark Judge,
who has a personal history of
creepy sexual exploits himself.
And all of this is being
discussed without the second
accusation Ronan Farrow and Jane
Meyer uncovered on Sunday night
from Yale, everyone involved on
this segment certainly was aware
of that but they're refusing to
discuss that.
I guess what I'm saying is:
believing women just means:
don’t reflexively
disbelieve women.
It doesn’t mean that relationships can’t be
complicated, or that every man
is going to go to jail for being
in a toxic relationship with a woman.
It simply means: let’s take a look at these issues,
especially when a lifetime appointment
for a person who will be making decisions about
women’s autonomy is what at stake here.
