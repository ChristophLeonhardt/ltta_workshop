Oh
in China women are in short supply with
millions more men than women so when it
comes time to marry the odds aren't good
it's estimated one in five men won't be
able to find a bride a personal and also
national disaster I'm Steve Chow on this
episode of 101 East we meet the men
resorting to drastic action to avoid a
life alone she has just come out of her
mold
her name is one five eight because she
is 1.5 eight meters tall in a few hours
she will have a face hair and eyes she
exists because there's a lack of women
in China for 35 years more boys have
been born here than girls it's resulted
in a severe gender imbalance that
endangers the country's stability
hern√°n is china's most populated
province at the same time it's the place
with the fewest women lungs we was born
here 32 years ago in the village of
gongs on he's already over the normal
age of marriage here in the countryside
but likes we can't find a wife he still
lives with his parents
someone who Madonna Angela
we always happens on gone full of
ambition Russell's on
land sweep isn't the only one around
here looking for a wife there are
hundreds of so-called dacha love
villages in the region each one full of
single men desperately looking for women
to marry in 1979 China introduced the
one-child policy
it was meant to avoid overpopulation but
in the countryside sons are much more
desirable because they can work in the
fields dual we can call your iPhone your
patent
sing your handle fionna these days
doctors are not allowed to reveal the
gender of the unborn baby
but some still do persuaded with the
help of a bride
even today slogans like this extolling
the benefits of girls are displayed
around the villages but the preference
for boys is a long and lasting tradition
here
they say that raising a girl is like
cultivating someone else's field because
a girl moves into her husband's family
after marriage couples wish for a son to
take care of them as they age and to
carry on the family name
so girls continue to be aborted 116 boys
are born for every 100 girls several

also involved
they use their taxis to distribute the
cards in villages they suspect might
house abducted women you might well
Jenna goes our Indian an Apollo the
cards were the idea of computer
scientist Shem Hal after reading about
abduction cases he wanted to help

trying to teach you not to tell Jin are

what are the authorities doing to stop
the trafficking of women
neither the Ministry of Public Security
in Beijing nor its regional branches are
willing to speak to us but they did send
us these videos policemen conducting
checks on a train others on assignment
in the countryside
and this vision of a crackdown in the
yunnan region in the country south it
showed the arrest of several hundred
traffickers among the two women who
allegedly sold under women these videos
were probably made for Chinese TV as
evidence that the authorities are doing
everything they can to prevent women
from being kidnapped they even showed
traffickers being interrogated
your damaged ego boys yeah
how much you got Oh comers and so much
taller than you I'm sure it's a 90 day
look better than each other university
in the last year the Chinese police say
they have saved 30,000 women's
trafficking networks are uncovered every
month traffickers can receive sentences
of 10 years in prison the men who buy
the women can get sentences of 3 years
we meet up again with blonde sweetie
The Bachelor from Hernandez Shanghai
train station
Lance Way has been in Indonesia for two
months he isn't alone anymore
his wife is called lie she's from an
Indonesian seaside village
she's riding on a train for the first
time
non-sweet forced lie
what an egg that's what you mean you let
me see what my doing but I was not in
dimension did I
Lance we paid traffic as more than
$10,000 lies father received a part of
that money for his daughter's hand live
learned a bit of Mandarin from watching
Chinese TV
she is the fifth woman from her village
to marry a Chinese man
well I even saw he
why doesn't know what kind of life she
will have in China she was told by the
trafficker her new husband is rich and
she thinks she will have an easier life
than in Indonesia
lie has arrived in Gangnam
the bachelor village so she will live
with their new husband's parents Lance
we bought her to the country on a family
residence permit which lie we'll have to
renew every year but she doesn't have a
work permit ma doesn't understand the
local dialect you have any desire in
India
why we'll probably never see Indonesia
again her in-laws sacrificed too much to
risk escaping but how many women will be
bought and sold and how many men must
live alone before tradition is let go
and the births of both boys and girls
are accepted and celebrated with equal
joy China stopped the one-child policy
in 2015 all couples are now allowed to
have two children maybe it's time to
remember another Chinese saying women
hold up half the sky
