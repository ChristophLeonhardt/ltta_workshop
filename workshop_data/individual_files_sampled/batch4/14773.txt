you shut your lips right now and listen we are we are not going to be told by white trash what to do anymore okay that is you're talking to working to build relations with our neighbors we're not we're not actually with you you're catching me with your fine music you don't need to do that that disgraceful scene happen in Burnaby BC at the illegal slum shanty town by professional actors and other paid protesters against the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion not only are they super gross and as you can see the racists calling Andrew man white trash making racial demands that he proved his Aboriginal status before standing on the public road it looks like they assaulted the person holding the camera we'll talk to Andrew in a minute about this but they're all in contravention of an order by the public by the by the Poorna team unisza palette e to vacate their illegal shantytown well joining us now is Andrew man the person in that video he's with suits and boots and he joins us now Andrew nice to meet you tell me a little bit more about what we saw there who was holding the camera what happened when they were jostled give us a few more facts yeah all right so the main fact I want to start off with Desura is that I didn't go up there as a fuck they didn't know I was due to boot to the porter when I was up there wet suits and boots first let me stop you right there it sounds great hey so boots is great lutheran boot is a non-for-profit resource Pro resource lobbying group we are out and about trying to garner support for a reason or sector in Canada and trying to counter the protesters that seem to be getting away which are too much aggression that's need to be getting away with it just they they have they're getting a leeway from the media and from the politicians to do essentially what they want when they want and dukedom boot we just decided it was about time that somebody stood up for the working man the jobs and the resource sector and that's our job throw you the suit side or the boot side and the boot side if you looking behind me here you can see a blank white wall and I'm just sitting in a little corner on our job site right now well thanks forever sir you're are you an electrician is that your background I'm an electrician yes sir right on you're working man and there'd be a lot of jobs that would come from any of these construction projects they're multibillion-dollar shovel-ready construction projects it's incredible that they're blocked by some hippies so you went out there and you were very well behaved at least in the clip I saw you did not swear you were not antagonistic you were not physical all the things that happened to you tell me a little bit more about what they said and did and who was it holding the camera was that was that your wife that was my fiancee holding the camera actually what she was pushed was she pushed yes she was pushed you can hear it another video I came down with the thunderous voice I think I could muster up saying you stay away from her you don't touch her and that's because while they touched it and you know it's the man in that relationship is my job to jump in and ensure her safety that's exactly what I did well you're exactly right and it's it's telling to me that they didn't have the courage to push you around I mean they came right in your face that was pretty gross and I think he brushed up against you but classic antifoam of classic all left cowards they go after the woman it just it always happens they've done it to our reporters to Sheila Gunn read when Lauren southern was with us faith Goldie they always beat up or try to beat up the women I think it should says a lot about them doesn't it I couldn't tell you why they do that but you're correct it seems they go for the easy target the low-hanging fruit Victoria is 5 feet tall I'd be surprised if she weighed over a hundred pounds she is the easiest target you could find and the protesters after the video cut out told me to go back to my car with my underage girlfriend well she's not underage first of all she's exactly my age and they assaulted her which leads me to think they in their mind just assaulted a minor how is that so that is theoretically the lowest hanging fruit and under 100 pound minor female is what in their head they assaulted at that time now we sense our own Sheila Gunn read to that same location a few days ago we knew that they would come and try and rough ER up because they've done her before so we sent a professional security guard and because of that she was okay and our cameraman was okay were there any private security or police there was there a police car did any authority observe this altercation no sir there was no private security and there was there was no RCMP presence there but in this all happened by the way when did that video where when was the film's this filmed Monday night at around 7:00 yeah all right so I know for a fact because I've seen a copy of it the city has issued an injunction which is basically a way of saying a court a legal order a legal order saying get out we're gonna clear out your shantytown your slum sounds like they're still there is that right well they're clearly still there I hear the deadline was 6 a.m. Saturday morning for them to do a vacated estate and they're clearly still on site they don't intend to leave and I think they they will do whatever they need to to stay they don't want to leave their site you know you have two people they may be mentally ill I don't know you have an older man and a middle-aged woman there I don't think it would be tough to very gently pick them up put them in the back of a police vehicle take them to court or whatever I mean I don't think it like it doesn't look like these are heavily armed bodybuilders I think really half a dozen police could come and clear this whole thing up and then you bring in a you know a 1-800 got junk truck to pick up their shantytown like it should not be a logistical e difficult thing to do other than the lack of political will there is no one in burnaby whether it's a police prosecutor politician or the press willing to go in and fix his problem is I mean the fact that they're defying the order you know I would like to just I wouldn't say there's not a to eat and I can't speak for the political side there because I don't get involved in Burnet community politics but the police officers that came and assisted me in trying to find my license plate and to take the report after the assault they we're interested in the clearing of the of the camp they didn't seem to want it there they understood that they have to follow orders from their superiors got it though I'd say I'm compared to say there's not a single belief in burnaby that wants that gone thank you I accept your point the beat cops are probably sick of it but the brass are political I appreciate that important distinction again that's sort of a boots and suits distinction the boots the boots on the ground the cops on the beat want these hippies and hobos gone but the political brass are paying attention to what John Horgan the Premier were Justin Trudeau the Prime Minister you have to say that's my theory well it's probably not an incorrect theory hmm so it sounds like you have filed a police report you've got the video evidence in these partial video evidence do you think the police will take any action because I think I'm not sure of what happened to you could be called an assault maybe but it looks like what what happened your fiance definitely was so in the video what happened to me was that you can see that I clearly got brushed by that elder and I would never press charges on him for any reason I could not do not instigate any further the young fellow that pushed my fiance also shoved me around too and at the end of the video you'll have to pay real good attention as to it but I advise that you watch the last 10 seconds of the video you'll see on the ground there is an aluminum piece of metal that's used to support road signs on construction sites laying on the ground and you'll see it in the video and then you'll see it get picked up and then you'll see the shadow of it based basically directly at my body in the video and the brawny guy who shoved Victoria and also dubbed me picked up that piece of aluminum in attempts to Jos me back to my car and then although it my fiance back to the car with it you'll finally know you don't need to do that well there you go so did you give this video evidence to the police instantly the police there I pulled out their laptop I plugged my phone into their laptop and we transferred the fire alright well listen I hope they do something I got to tell you I accept your observation with the cops the actual police on the street want to uphold the law he goes to the police academy saying I want to be a political hack they want to go uphold the law that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily
