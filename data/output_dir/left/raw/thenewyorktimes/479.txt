1
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,779
The HI-SEAS habitat was

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,348
created to simulate

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,217
an isolated, confined,

4
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,052
extreme environment.

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,458
And that involves isolation

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,793
in the form of being far away

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,861
from anything that remotely

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,496
looks like civilization.

9
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,307
We have really tried to create

10
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,209
an  environment where this is

11
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,811
what their life would be like

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,312
once they get to Mars.

13
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,732
when I walked into the

14
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,000
tool shed and they've got out

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,635
storage of food

16
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,370
There are about 50 cans of

17
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,905
Spam staring right at me

18
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,049
You know it's not so much that

19
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:30,884
things are going to be

20
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,352
difficult because we can solve

21
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,187
difficult problems but

22
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,522
not knowing what is going to

23
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,322
happen

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,625
creates a lot of fear.

25
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,604
We're all going to have our

26
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,107
anxious days and

27
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,075
down days.

28
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,993
Managing conflict is going to be

29
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,663
really important in the habitat.

30
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,866
But it is inevitable that

31
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,700
we'll have arguments and things.

32
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:22,902
Part of it is just

33
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,403
approaching this

34
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,604
all professionally.

35
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,238
You could list a whole

36
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,505
different set of reasons as to

37
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,608
why we should colonize Mars.

38
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,778
The strongest argument is still

39
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,981
that if we stay on Earth

40
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,949
the human race has

41
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,150
all its eggs in one basket.

42
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,329
Mars is a really important

43
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,431
planet to study because

44
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,699
the history of Earth

45
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,500
and the history of Mars

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,134
may be linked.

47
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,210
We can only really figure

48
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,946
that out by pushing

49
00:04:39,946 --> 00:00:00,000
further into this unknown.
