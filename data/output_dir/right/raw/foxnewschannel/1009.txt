PEACE TALKS.

00:00:03,118 --> 00:00:04,219
>> Martha: IT'S REMARKABLE.

4
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,689
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

LIEUTENANT COLONEL MICHAEL

MICHAEL, LET ME START WITH YOU,

20
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:29,678
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE

21
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:30,379
WALKABOUT, THE SELFIES AND THE

22
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,982
NEWS THAT THE DEAR LEADER HAS

23
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,183
ALREADY DECIDED, ACCORDING TO

24
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:35,884
HIS FOLKS, THAT HE'S GOING TO

25
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:37,386
LEAVE THIS AFTERNOON, SINGAPORE

26
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:39,188
TIME?

27
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:42,725
>> I WILL GO TO MICHAEL.

28
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:43,959
>> I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE OF

29
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,595
THE THINGS YOU SAID IN YOUR

30
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:46,895
INTRO.

31
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:49,098
YEARS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP

32
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,967
TWEETED HE TREATS TO THE HATERS

33
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,035
AND LOSERS, HE DOES SO WITH

34
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:53,402
AFFECTION.

35
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:56,171
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THEY WERE

36
00:00:56,171 --> 00:01:01,877
BORN SO [BLEEP] UP.

37
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:02,611
TO HAVE SOME CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM

38
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,179
THAT THIS CAN GO IN A POSITIVE

39
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:05,647
DIRECTION IS NOT TOO MUCH TO

40
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:06,115
ASK.

41
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,249
WE COULD SEE DIPLOMATIC

42
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,217
RELATIONS, THE END OF THE KOREAN

43
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:10,419
WAR, FURTHER TALKS AND A PAUSE

44
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:14,289
ON THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

45
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,391
MIKE POMPEO HAS CAREFULLY

46
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,458
SHIPPED THE ARGUMENT FROM

47
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,493
DENUCLEARIZING NORTH KOREA TO

48
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,427
DENUCLEARIZING THE WHOLE

49
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:18,794
PRINCIPLE.

50
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:20,696
ALREADY THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF

51
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:22,698
AN AGREEMENT.

52
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,666
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

53
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,801
KIM JONG UN ON WHEN YOU WATCH

54
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,702
THEM WALKING AROUND TAKING THE

55
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:28,303
SELFIES AND YOU HEAR THAT HE HAS

56
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:30,272
ALREADY DECIDED THAT HE'S

57
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:31,040
LEAVING TODAY?

58
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,510
>> THIS COULD BE A FAINT.

59
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,345
THE MEETING WAS CALLED OFF A

60
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:37,479
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

61
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,514
THEY LIKE PLAYING HARDBALL, THIS

62
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,115
HOLLYWOOD THING, WHO WAS GOING

63
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:41,617
TO GO TO WHOSE TABLE?

64
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,919
GETTING THEM TO GO TO

65
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,220
NORTH KOREA, A BIG CONCESSION ON

66
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,889
HIS PART IN THE FACT ALSO THAT

67
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:47,623
THE NORTH KOREAN MEDIA IS

68
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:48,490
ALREADY REPORTING ON THE STREET

69
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,659
AND WHERE IT'S USUALLY THE

70
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,461
REPORT AFTER THE MEETING HAS

71
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:53,295
OCCURRED IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL

72
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:54,496
IF THEY TELL THAT THEY HAVE

73
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:55,697
ARTIE MADE SOME AGREEMENT, THERE

74
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,699
WILL BE SOME SUCCESS BY SOME

75
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:58,300
MEASURE.

76
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,501
>> Martha: ALSO GETS NERVOUS

77
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:00,469
LEAVING HOME.

78
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:01,870
THE PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA JUST

79
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,172
FOUND OUT THIS MORNING AND FACT

80
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,706
THAT THE LEADER OF THEIR COUNTRY

81
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:05,741
WAS LEAVING AND GOING TO

82
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:06,108
SINGAPORE.

83
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:09,344
THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN

84
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,279
VERY AWARE OF THIS.

85
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,047
THE MEDIA IS DIFFERENT THERE AS

86
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:12,514
WE KNOW.

87
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,783
INTERESTING THAT HE LET GO THREE

88
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:17,853
OF HIS TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS,

89
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,888
KIM JONG UN, IN RECENT DAYS.

90
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,123
BEGS THE QUESTION, PERHAPS THEY

91
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:22,724
WERE AGAINST SOME OF THE MOVES

92
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:24,460
HE'S PLANNING TO UNDERTAKE HERE.

93
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,194
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

94
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:27,496
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

95
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:28,597
KIM JONG UN HAS A DOMESTIC

96
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:29,531
AUDIENCE AS WELL, THAT'S NAMELY

97
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,867
THE NORTH KOREAN MILITARY, AND

98
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:35,070
THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM TRULY IS

99
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,804
KIND OF THE HOLY GRAIL OF THE

100
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:39,274
NORTH KOREAN MILITARY.

101
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:41,176
TO THAT END, THE REASON THAT WE

102
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,345
ARE SITTING HERE IS PRESIDENT

103
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:46,048
DONALD J. TRUMP MADE BOTH THE

104
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:46,748
NORTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE

105
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:48,050
REALIZE THAT THE USE OF

106
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,685
CREDIBLE -- THE CREDIBLE USE OF

107
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,820
MILITARY FORCE IS ON THE TABLE,

108
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,956
WOULD BE USED AND I THINK IT HAS

109
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,424
CHANGED THEIR CALCULUS.

110
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,592
HERETO FOR THEY HAVE BELIEF THAT

111
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,494
THEY HAD TO HAVE A FULLY

112
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,729
FUNCTIONAL ICBM IN ORDER TO

113
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,264
ENSURE THE REGIME'S SURVIVAL AND

114
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,466
NOW DONALD TRUMP IS MADE THEM

115
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,201
REALIZE THAT, NO, IF YOU GET

116
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:08,103
THAT ICBM, IT WILL MEAN YOUR

117
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:09,138
DESTRUCTION, AND I HOPE THAT'S

118
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:11,106
THE MESSAGE IN THE ONE ON ONE

119
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:13,475
THAT IS DELIVERED PERFECTLY

120
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,677
CLEAR, THAT IF YOU USE THIS TIME

121
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:17,880
TO DRAG THINGS OUT WITH THE

122
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,647
INSPECTION REGIME AND THEN BACK

123
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:20,115
OUT LATER AND DECLARE A NUCLEAR

124
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,518
PROGRAM, THAT IT WILL MEAN THE

125
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,285
DESTRUCTION OF YOUR REGIME.

126
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,219
>> Martha: DAVID, ONE OF THE

127
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,021
THINGS THAT SEEMS TO HAVE SUNK

128
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,257
IN WITH KIM JONG UN IS THAT THE

129
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:30,526
STATUS QUO IS NOT ANY LONGER FOR

130
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:30,792
HIM.

131
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,395
EITHER HE NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS

132
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:34,763
MODEL AND OPEN UP HIS ECONOMY

133
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:38,066
AND AGREE TO SOME SECURITY

134
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:38,600
ASSURANCES FROM THE

135
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,802
UNITED STATES AND DISMANTLE HIS

136
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:42,171
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, OR HE'S GOING

137
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:43,572
TO FACE A MILITARY THREAT FROM

138
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:44,473
THE UNITED STATES.

139
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:45,741
THOSE OF THE CHOICES THAT HE HAS

140
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,909
ON THE TABLE.

141
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,477
COMMENT ON THAT AND ALSO ON THIS

142
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:51,079
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE ENTIRE

143
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,747
PENINSULA THAT SECRETARY OF

144
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:53,282
STATE POMPEO WAS TALKING ABOUT.

145
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:55,083
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

146
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,285
THIS RISES ABOVE POLITICS SO I

147
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,520
THINK WE SHOULD STOP TALK ABOUT

148
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,088
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.

149
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:00,722
DEMOCRATS ARE ROOTING FOR

150
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,357
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THIS ONE.

151
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:04,693
HE DESERVES CREDIT FOR BEING A

152
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:05,827
DISRUPTIVE DIPLOMAT, AS JUST

153
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:06,662
KIM JONG UN.

154
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:07,529
WE ARE GIVING HIM SOMETHING BY

155
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:08,463
HAVING THE MEETING.

156
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:09,965
I DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE

157
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:10,499
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION.

158
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:14,036
THIS IS A REAL WIN FOR

159
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:14,736
KIM JONG UN, JUST SITTING DOWN

160
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,137
WITH HIM.

161
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:17,606
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE PAIN

162
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:18,774
OF THE SANCTIONS OR IF HE HAS

163
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:20,576
JUST GOTTEN TO THIS POINT WITH

164
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:22,144
NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WHERE HE NOW IS

165
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,112
SATIATED AND HE WANTS TO MOVE

166
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:25,514
AND TURN THE COUNTRY TO ECONOMIC

167
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:25,914
PROSPERITY.

168
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,116
THAT'S GOING TO BE A KEY ISSUE.

169
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,185
THE QUESTION YOU RAISE IS WHAT

170
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:31,320
DOES DENUCLEARIZATION MEAN, AND

171
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,721
THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE

172
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:33,722
PROCESS THAT FOLLOWS THESE

173
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,490
MEETINGS, WHICH I THINK WILL GO

174
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,891
WELL.

175
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,092
THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE

176
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:39,094
PACE AT WHICH WE NEGOTIATE THIS.

177
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:40,929
THERE'S MAYBE 300 STEPS.

178
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,531
THIS IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED

179
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,732
THAN THE IRANIAN DEAL, AND

180
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,300
FINALLY WHAT PRICE IS INVOLVED

181
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,969
AND STORMED THE MIC IN TERMS OF

182
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:48,203
ECONOMICS INCENTIVES HERE.

183
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:49,338
>> Martha: THE PRESIDENT HAS

184
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:50,405
SAID IT'S A ONE-SHOT DEAL SO

185
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,406
HE'S DEFINITELY PUTTING THE

186
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:52,574
PRESSURE ON KIM JONG UN ON TO

187
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:53,909
USE THIS MOMENT PRODUCTIVELY AND

188
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,111
FOR BOTH SIDES TO WALK OUT

189
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:57,679
FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE GOTTEN

THERE'S A LOT OF SIMILARITIES.

212
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:31,179
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO COME HOME

213
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,114

214
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,883

NOTHING TO EARN IT.

242
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,290

MISSILE TESTS GOING OFF PRETTY

248
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:23,131
MUCH EVERY SIX WEEKS AND PEOPLE

249
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:23,865
WERE CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THEM

250
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:27,235
MIGHT MISTAKENLY LAND IN THE

251
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:29,805

WE'VE ALSO GOT HOSTAGES BACK.

254
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:36,645
TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT

255
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,312
IS GROWTH ALONG THE SPECTRUM

256
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:40,682
JUST BASED ON THE FACTS SEEMS

257
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:41,516
UNTRUE.

258
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:42,484
>> THERE ARE A FEW POINTS HERE.

259
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:44,286
THE FACT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT

260
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:46,455
THIS, TRUMP HAS GONE FROM

261
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,323
DEMANDING DENUCLEARIZATION OF

262
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:49,358
NORTH KOREA TO A PROCESS THAT

263
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:52,060
THEY WILL NEGOTIATE OF THE

264
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,928
KOREAN PENINSULA, WHICH OTHERS

265
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:56,164
HERE HAVE AGREED UPON AND BEEN

266
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:56,665

00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,272
HANDS OF NORTH KOREANS, WHO HAD

271
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,241
HIM AND HE RETURN HOME BLIND,

272
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:08,276
DEAF AND HOWLING ONLY TO DIE A

273
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:11,313
WEEK LATER.

274
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:12,013
>> Martha: PRESIDENT OBAMA ON

275
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:13,982

00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:14,783
PRESIDENT TRUMP NORTH KOREA IS

>> THAT WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY

280
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,056
THING HE SAID TO HIM AND I DO

281
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,024
THINK THE PRESENCE OF TWO PEOPLE

282
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:26,962
PLAY IT LARGER TO ME.

283
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,264
BARACK OBAMA, TRUMP IS OBSESSED

284
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,466
WITH DOING BARACK OBAMA'S LEGACY

285
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,200
AND EVERYTHING HE'S DONE AND I

286
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,368

00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,036
SHOW TO HIM, I GOT THIS MEETING,

288
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:36,471

00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,274
BEAT YOU AT.

291
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,709
XI JINPING IS THE POWER BROKER

292
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,510
IN THIS AREA.

293
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,944
IF NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT HIM,

294
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:45,380
ESPECIALLY IN NORTH KOREA AND I

295
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,615
THINK XI JINPING HAS A LOT TO

296
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:48,150
SAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS

297
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,817
NEGOTIATION MORE THAN JUST

00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,686
FLYING HIM TO GET TO THIS

300
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,357

00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,525
FATHER BEFORE HIM AND PROVIDE

302
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:57,893
