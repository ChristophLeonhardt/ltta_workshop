the grievance study gang is struck again these you may remember the impish liberal academics who decided to submit articles filled with absurd leftist nonsense to academic journals to see if the journals could tell the difference between fake articles filled with absurd leftist nonsense and the real articles filled with absurd leftist nonsense they usually publish and no they couldn't the academic journals accepted articles on subjects like dog rape culture fat body boat building and whether it's okay to put white male students in Chains to help them overcome their sense of comfort I am NOT making this up but in what is perhaps their masterpiece prankster academics James Lindsay Peter Bogosian and Helen pluck Rose submitted a rewritten section of Adolf Hitler's psychopathic screed mind Kampf to one of the top feminist journals in the country athelia and Ophelia accepted it a philia editor shrieky Virago defended her decision to run Hitler's piece saying quote you know it seems we got this Hitler fellow all wrong when conservatives demanded liberty for all and limits on government power we used to call them Hitler because we thought that's what Hitler believed but it turns out Hitler wasn't such a bad fellow after all and he wanted to use victim ideology to oppress people just like we do in fact we would invite mr. Hitler to speak at our next feminist conference if it weren't for the fact he's a dead white male which could prejudice some feminists against his otherwise palatable views so I guess some other feminists will have to stand in for Hitler pounding the podium and screaming hate-filled in an ADIZ which will at least prove that a woman can do that just as well as any man unquote and okay I did make that quote up but the rest of the story is totally true and while you might think accepting an article by Hitler would give the girls a trophy Lea's second thoughts about their own philosophy not at all to do that would be to accept anti-feminist values like reason and decency trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right we're back we hardly left it was a non

about the non news which is Elizabeth Warren has announced she is actually less Indian than everybody else in America I mean I went to 23andme and had my DNA done and I think I have more you know I have I think it was crime the the Chappaqua the Tripucka wha whatever was it but Elizabeth Warren is tout you know Trump challenged her to test her DNA so to give a million dollars to charity if she tested her DNA and proved that she was actually an Indian as she has pretended to be and she guys this thing I don't know what was it was like one it was zero percent the test says she was zero percent to 1.6 percent American Indian which I think most Americans are 1.8 percent or something like that American Indian so she is proof I now wanted to go by her native name walks like a duck because because if it walks like a duck and it's the quacks like a duck it probably is a duck and she's white it's like hey nothing wrong with being white I like white people some of my best friends are white people you know Elizabeth take it easy you know it's a fine the other thing is of course is the violence the violence over the weekend from the left mostly from the left has been just it just continues and it's getting worse and is getting uglier honest they're threatening to do worse on Friday the Metropolitan Republican Club in Manhattan was attacked it houses the Manhattan Republican Party and the New York City Regional Office of the New York Republican Party was vandalized including broken windows spray-painted anarchist symbols and the criminal group that did the damage left a note they were angry that Gavin McGinnis was gonna talk if that's your word Gavin McGinnis is your worst nightmare you know you know like you're you're not you have nothing to be afraid of they left a note air attack is merely a beginning we are not passive we are not civil and we will not apologize those of good conscience and clear mind know this state of oppression cannot remain I know you're all feeling very oppressed out there the u.s. fascist political system is one of the most savage institutions in history and we will combat it relentlessly until all are free of American barbarism these guys have windows in their apartment can they look outside and see that like everything's going great is that a problem from here's an endemic a montage of all the Democrat politicians denouncing the attack yeah that was it that was the whole montage so yeah you're not hearing you know cuz this is the problem but but then in Portland there was more violence you know the the anti-shah people you know I want to get go back and and get one of our grace may be Cynthia one of our great artists back there to do a cartoon for me of a mad guy in a black mask with a label anti-shah on his shirt and then a guy in a white hood with anti claw on his shirt because you say you're an ting something doesn't mean you're not the thing so there's fascist who called himself anthe fascists are out in the streets of Portland you know terrorizing people yelling at people yelling racist things at white people so the Patriot prayer rally was holding a prayer patriotic prayer rally now let's let's be fair here they had clubs to normally when I pray I leave my club at home I mean just just saying you know I don't bring my club to my you know it's like you say don't bring a knife to a gunfight I don't usually bring my club to a prayer meeting so they were looking for trouble too but it really does look from the videos you can just play the videos in the background so people can see it really does look from the videos that the anti-fog people started it by pepper spraying some of the some of the prayer Patriot people they set a a flag on fire now they set a flag on fire which was rescued but then it just became after the after the pepper spray was sprayed it just became a genuine genuine Donnybrook with people punching each other's lights out this is what's happening and of course the problem is the problem is not the thugs on the street there aren't enough of them to really cause problems the problem is the leadership of the Democratic Party not denouncing the thugs because they're afraid of losing their support everybody makes fun of Donald Trump when he was asked to denounce the Klan and he didn't denounce the Klan because he was afraid of losing votes that was wrong Trump was wrong to do that now the Democrats have fallen in line and they are not denouncing these people and it is just disgusting and the problem they have the problem that they have is the Democrat Party has drifted left the Democrat Party has drifted left and left ISM is inherently violent they remember the debate between the left and right is not an equal debate it is not one person saying we want this this and this and a free America and the other people saying we want this this and that and a free America one side to saying we want a free America with different opinions people can speak people can talk about it debate things compromise go forward that's the right on the left they want to force you to do what they want you to do and so of the that's the first reason the left is inherently violent the left is inherently violent because it wants the power to force you to do and think and say what it wants you to do think and say and you and if you have government if you're in the government if you're in the government you don't have to take to the streets with clubs if you're in the government because you have the police force you have the force of government nobody talks about the fact I talk about it but not that many people talk about the fact that when you pay taxes you were paying on threat of violence your pain so that the police do not show up with their guns and take you away because you cannot fight the violence of the state the state has a monopoly on true violence we can take you away if you don't pay your taxes when they're out of government they have to do it through terror and they do it by taking to the streets and if you don't think if you don't think the establishment left is in on this listen to Bernie Sanders when he is talking to Jake Tapper and Jake Tapper asks him about whether or not he's going to denounce this violence as cut number eight now Jake I don't think it's a question of going high or going low I think it's a question of telling the truth and the truth is that you have a president who lies all of the time a pathological liar I don't think that's what the American people want you have a Republican leadership in the House and the Senate that tried came within one vote of throwing thirty two million people off of the health insurance they currently have you have leadership there in the House and the Senate that wants to do way with the pre-existing protections that people have in this country so they can get health insurance when you have cancer or heart disease you have leadership in the House and Senate led by the president that provided massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country over a 10-year period 83% of the benefits go to the top one percent you have a president and Republican leadership who supported a budget supported a budget which would have cut Medicaid by a trillion dollars devastating for the elderly people now take out the emotions take out all the emotional language about devastating for the American people in cancer and all it take it all of that what he's talking about is taking your money he's not talking remember they don't have any money the government doesn't have any money they just take your money that you earned you go out and you earn money to support your health care to pay for your health care you go out and earn money to pay for the things that you want Bernie Sanders thinks he should be allowed to spend that money they always talk about it and you can hear kZO Google eyes Cortes doing the same thing talking about it'll save America money it won't save you money it's not America's money it's your money you earned it you work for it that's not greed is not greed to want the things you work for it is greed to take them away to spend them on other things hoping that it will buy your votes and by the way they're always talking about the middle class remember under socialism the middle class disappears and all you have of the poor and the rich why because you can't tax the rich because they are the ones who create all the wealth so you cannot tax them so they get away scot-free you can't tax the poor because they don't have any money you wind up taught taxing the people you write up calling people rich if they make more money than most people but that's really the middle class you destroy the middle class so that's why there is no middle class under socialism only the very poor in the very rich go up to San Francisco take a look and you'll see what it's like up there so that's number one the reason they need violence is because they want to force you to do things and violence is how you force people to do them things that they don't want to do number two they have been hiding in safe spaces they own every means of communication in America except the ones that we have taken back as this kind of like little revolutionary force popping up from behind rocks we have a voice now on the Internet we didn't have we have a voice on podcast we have Fox News but mostly they own all of the means of communication including the Academy Hollywood and the news business and so they never have to debate they never have to debate and in the New York Post Carole Markowitz writes she says what's behind the recent spread of outraged mobs on US streets wild-eyed and throwing violent fits because they're favored political outcome didn't happen how did so many Americans give up on resolving disagreements through discussion and turn the fact that a disagreement exists into an excuse for a tantrum campuses started setting up safe spaces well before 2015 when the news hit our media college students were literally taking shelter from the possibility of hearing opinions they might disagree with and this comes from a news media and Academy Hollywood defining the left as the antidote to hatred not as the left as one side and the right as another two people having a negotiation because they lose that argument they lose the argument the argument is do you want us to force everyone to believe what we believe or do you want them to be free everybody would say we want you to be free ah but if they say yes but on that freedom that freedom just it's a dog whistle for racism it's a dog whistle for sexism for anti-homosexual sexual hate for anti Islamic hate that's the way they debate so if if there's just them and hatred you are justified in being violent and the biggest safe space the media the the biggest safe space the left has is the media and it is the media that contributes to this violence by taking one side I have got to play this this cut of Stephanie ruhle and obviously she's a biased reporter and biased commentator that's fine there's nothing wrong with it but listen to her absolute Wonder and dismay at the fact that this Kavanagh confirmation a confirmation that the left demanded that due process be put aside that the presumption of innocence be put aside that violence against senators screaming at them tormenting them chasing them out of restaurants cornering them in elevators that that was okay that that didn't play well with the American people she's shocked she's absolutely stunned listen to her there was so much talk or there is so much talk about the Blue Wave when we all went through the Kavanagh experience in the last few weeks many people said this is going to drive more Democrats to go out and vote but if you actually look at the polls they've tightened they've tightened this Kavanagh situation has hurt Democrats in the way that they handled it we knew the Democrats were excited to vote before we know through the Cavanaugh confirmation now a lot more Republicans are excited to vote one of the things Democrats have been pushing is they're sort of the moral leaders and they have been pointing the finger at Republicans and something sort of got muzzled in the last few weeks that when you sit down with even a centrist and you talk about the Cavanaugh confirmation whether it's my feelings or not they're quickly saying it's not just dirty politics on one side and Merrick garland on one side the way Mitch McConnell handled it more and more people are saying they don't like the way Democrats handle this she shocked even when you say this is a centrist they don't like riots and violence and intimidation and getting rid of due process I love the fact that she says we keep telling them that we're the moral boys and yet they turn away what could possibly be wrong if she were not in her safe space if she ever got out of her offices which I'm sure in New York if she ever went out and talked to people just spent some time with them she would find that Americans so help me have a much much more nuanced intelligent insightful view of what's going on in anybody on television anybody anybody on cable news they are much more black-and-white than most of the people you meet out in the country they'll tell you that Trump those things they don't like they'll tell you all of that stuff but of course rioting doesn't play but she doesn't know it it was a wonderful exchange on 60 minutes Trump was on with lesley stahl where he starts to talk about the media listen to Leslie saw she does not want to hear it and he finally just shuts her down it's really funny cut number four the other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was I really mean it I'm not saying that as a soundbite I knew how does it change the subject again or not but even the way you asked me a question like about separation yeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about run your answer but you did it four times I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want to have that fight with you I'm president and you know and that of course it causes what is driving them insane that nobody is paying attention to them this Cavanagh thing how hard did they sell this Cavanagh thing that this was an injustice to all women to fifty percent of the country was an injustice had nothing to do with all women it had to do with one man being accused of one thing by one person with no corroborating evidence that's what the story was about but they didn't report that story they reported the story about women WOM why and you know it's it's everybody everybody represents everybody because it's group thing and they can't believe people didn't buy it and meanwhile Trump's popularity has taken an uptick all right so that's two reasons that violent is inherent to the left one is left ISM is by philosophy by it is essentially force left ISM is force and if you don't have the force of the government which disguises the force by diffusing it into all the gun power that government has if you don't have that force then you got to use it with a stick and a mask on the streets and vandalism and attacking people in pepper spray it's the same force but it's just concentrated because you do not have it diffused into the government and the second thing is that they are not used to debating because they've taken over the means of communication so they don't have to debate so they've convinced themselves that this is a moral holy war and they're on one side and we're on the other which simply isn't true and the third thing and maybe the worst of it is they are racist leftism is racist that does not mean that there are no racists on the right I've said this repeatedly of course there are racists everywhere there are people who look at the world in the simplistic way if they get mugged by a black eye all black eyes or criminals if they don't like what a white woman does well white women are bad but the leftism is racism because it is based on setting interest groups against each other it is not based on the melting pot is not based on bringing us together that was the other thing that Lesley Stahl talked about I just I just have to play this cut because it actually exemplifies what Trump was saying it's cut number one she says she talks about a divided country as if it weren't Bhama and he tells her it was she will not listen listen this anger that what's going to happen I think the economy is bringing people together it was very polarized under President Obama unbelievably polarized under President Obama I can see the country uniting I can't see it we have people Democrats who behaved horribly during the judge catheter you know what I'm saying but when you doing the hangings for the Supreme Court we had senators that behaved horribly but when you won you won no one is gonna argue with that one and then after you won instead of saying oh let's all come together this is wonderful let's heal all of this you come out and bash the Democrats well I bashed their attitude I bashed this thing why not try to Greece it was so unfair to judge Kavanagh I never seen anything like why not try to we need to be healed we need I don't think they want to heal yet I'll be Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement I don't think they want to be healed I do want to heal I'm not talking about Democrat I'm talking about the country the thing is the thing is when Obama was in office nobody ever talked about the fact that he was dividing the country nobody in the mainstream media ever talked about it and he ripped the country in half Obama did that I talked to liberals I try to explain to them what he looked like to us what he sounded like to us they cannot hear it because they look at everything according to race because they look at everything according to race because that is the way to divide the country listen to some more of the note that was left on the vandalized Republican headquarters in New York the US government has established concentration camps around the country for Latino people in what world in what world you know people breaking the law are being punished and detained for breaking the law they have shamelessly murdered black people on what planet when it where is this happening is happening all in their imagination it continues the US government continues its war machine that has slaughtered Muslim people with impunity for decades that's what every president does that's what every soldier in America does they wake up say let me kill some Muslim people it's like we're going on a terrorist faction of the Muslim world a huge terrorist faction of the Muslim world has been trying to establish a Caliphate in the Middle East we have been fighting them the so-called land of the free leads the world and incarceration rates per capita because of the high crime anyway they look at everything in terms of race so they're angry racism leads to violence racism is hatred the latest one they have is white women here's michelle bernard at MSNBC on why white women just won't vote the way she wants them to traced her i believe has a new book out one of the things that she talks about as a white woman is that the belief that white women have always gained power through the proximal the proximity that they have to white males to their husbands and they vote in the same way that their husbands do because it always in somehow favors them and help that i would like to finish my statement in the statement that I am making is I do not see any reason for Democrats to believe that after the Brett Kavanaugh hearings we are going to see a flood of white women particularly Republican red state feminists come out and vote for Democrats god flood of white women I can't I can't have it I had a dream like that one so it was like it's embarrassing I don't want to talk about it but you know Kyle Smith writing at National Review talks about how white women has become a disparaging term and he quotes the New York Times white women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual gain from New Yorker despite the enduring legacy of testimony by black women white women have often played the protagonists in the history of sexual violence and black women have been relegated to the supporting cast and at NBC News white women who voted for Trump clearly have no issue with the president's openly misogynistic behaviors demeaning of female reporters and his mocking of Christine Blasi Ford so white women you are the latest you know let me let me in this I let me just put it to you this way a woman won the Nobel Prize for she was a Yazidi woman let me make sure I tan Nadia Murad Nadia Murad won the Nobel Prize along with Denis mukwege II for fighting against sexual violence during wartime this has been sexual violence in wartime is it's a very hard thing to deal with because it may be inherent to war for men to then rape and rape may be inherent to war they don't know how to deal with it it's just when people are reduced to the level that war reduces people to when you're in the midst of this violence rape rape occurs you know rape at happens and it's it's a terrible terrible thing but the thing is the CDs were purposely targeted for extinction by Isis and one of the ways they targeted them was by taking the women selling them into slavery making sure they got pregnant with Isis men and with Isis children and naughty Murad is a victim of this but also has won the Nobel Prize how many people knew that how many people listening to this knew that how many people who listened to the mainstream media knew that Nadia Murat because they were racist the left is racist they don't want to say it's the only time when violence against women matters is when they can use it to get power that's the only time it matters listen I want to play George Clooney's wife Amal Clooney who was talking at the UN about about Nadia merabh the reason I'm playing hers not cuz she's a celebrity is because she speaks English and Nadia Murad doesn't and so I know a lot of people are just listening to this so you can understand what she's saying listen to what happened what Isis did to Nadia Murad and thousands of years CD women nadia was one of 6700 is Edie's taken by Isis two summers ago to be sold in markets and on Facebook sometimes for as little as $20 Nadia's mother was one of 80 older women who were executed and buried in an unmarked grave her brothers part of a group of 600 who were murdered in a single day make no mistake what Nadia has told us about is genocide and genocide doesn't happen by accident you have to plan it before the genocide began two years ago the ISIS research and fatwah Department studied the Yazidis and concluded that as a Kurdish speaking group that did not have a holy book they were non believers whose enslavement was a quote firmly established aspect of the Sharia firmly established aspect of the Sharia no got rid of Isis yeah Donald Trump how about giving him a Nobel Prize I would be interesting that would be but of course none of this stuff as I've said before none of this is about what it's about it's always about the power it goes back to the power goes back to the force and that's why the left is violent when when I say that you know I wouldn't pick on the left if they were just a riot in Portland some bad guys important that's happened before what is new what is new is the Silence of the Democrats the Silence of the Democrats as this stuff is going on because it's who they are it's who they have drifted to the left and that that left-wing philosophy is inherently violent it is inherently an act of force socialism is an act of force everything except freedom is an act of force right under capitalism you'd make something I want to buy it I freely give you my money you freely give me what you made that is freedom that's not not force it is force when you have to take money away from people that they earn and give it to others that is the core essential philosophy of leftism it is an inherently violent and now because they haven't got the handles of power thank God that violence is taking to the streets and let's play that montage of left-wing Democrat politicians denouncing it once again let's play the whole thing this time yeah there it is that was it so you know it is inherent in their philosophy we have the lovely and talented star of another Kingdom is coming up Michael Knowles is

can you hear me now I can yes can you hear me now hear me now I think I lost my voice after shouting am i television last night but what you made me do even I felt slightly guilty about this and especially you've done such a good job on another Kingdom that I'd like I have to actually might miced you know somebody wrote me over the weekend this is true they they threatened to stop listening to Ben because he's so mean to you and I said and I said abandoned you you know behind the scenes and in secret we don't like to reveal this to of them but Ben has been incredibly generous and and nice to you oh yeah the other day he was eating a sandwich and a pickle felt like a little slice of pickle fell off of it and it hit the floor and then he picked it up and offered it because I didn't I think the fact that when you went and grabbed it he didn't kick you but but anyway she was threatening to stop listening to Ben and I told her that you would just just boys rough out we're just boys we're just playing it's okay mom birthday but now now with your tremendous performance on another Kingdom we have all lifted or respect you to a little bit of respect I really appreciate it I really liked you since that at weed over the weekend you said you have to tweet out this episode of another Kingdom to prove that Michael Knowles is possibly good at one thing you know it's been so much fun to do this story has been a lot of fun I was you know I hadn't seen it I had only we just shot it and then I you know will I leave and so I finally got to see it the artwork is unbelievable it is it really is nice and even my wife said nice things about you Wow I know that yeah I know and you were you were over the house over the weekend he you know so she was not in a good mood I know she just she forced it I was very annoyed it'd appreciate you getting me hammered before my morning Fox and Friends yeah I wanted you to go directly from my house to the street home we got an hour of sleep I was as I was mostly speaking in cursive on Fox so to get you back I sent you to watch the the documentary of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and it was great right would you call it a documentary is that it I would say that triumph of the will offers a more critical analysis of the right party congress than RBZ it's not not entirely fair you're saying hagiography i mean i really mean this it does not begin to describe what this was I am not exaggerating I am not making a joke it I've never seen a hate geography like this it it begins so it's produced by CNN which is the best part of it all yeah yeah because at CNN films real news real bananas and it opens up it it bizarrely it opens up on the Red Scare so it's Ruth Ginsburg she's talking about how awful things used to be in the 50s you think she would talk about racial segregation or women not you know being able to work in certain industries no she talks about the Red Scare which tells you a lot about the point of view of this movie and the point of view of Ruth Ginsburg who you know the movies produced by radical leftists and Ruth Ginsburg is a radical leftist she is in she she really is that far over her whole career you know they try to present her as a moderate who finds her her left-wing voice later on that's not what happened she was a moderate because the court was very left-wing and then as George Bush appointed two original lists to the court not even real one and a half original lists to the court the court moved to the to the right but you know her whole career was left-wing I mean she she began her career as an activist during her Senate confirmation hearings she said not just that I support the roe v wade decision she said I support abortion rights she calls for abortion is she obviously a man said this before her confirmation that during her confirmation their confirmations okay yeah she said I support abortion in order for women to be equal abortion needs to be legal it needs to be everywhere so she's she's being confirmed to the court as an activist and and did Republicans vote for of course they did Republicans voted to confirm her I think it was 96 to 3 that and the movie makes a point about this yes the movie says they actually have Bill Clinton of all people who nominated her say this say well you know look it was a less partisan time but it was still pretty partisan yes it was partisan when it was conservative justices who were being nominated so they make their point is that she was so wonderful that even the right had to vote for which is really what the real point is is the right plays fair that's right the left doesn't yeah that's right you know you'd have people like John McCain I actually sort of admire this but about McCain he would vote for any judge any judge who goes up he says the president has the right to appoint the judge like might not like them but but the left doesn't doesn't abide that by that rule so you know a Ginsburg comes up in 1993 this is two years after Clarence Thomas two years after a high-tech lynching they also try to imply in the movie that Ruth Ginsburg was you know the the pioneer in women on the Supreme Court she wasn't the first woman on the Supreme Court the first woman was appointed by Ronald Reagan I know they make a big flush over the fact she's a woman right Reagan appointed Sandra Day O'Connor that's right that's insane yeah go ahead they virtually ignore Sandra Day O'Connor I like to virtually ignore sayin yeah but you know in they virtually ignore her they try to make ensberg the Trailblazer and it's there's such fiction it's such a stretch they're trying to say she is a cultural icon people make they call her the notorious RBG that's from one blog that like some people who read everyday feminism seriously term these are direct quotes every time RBG wrote a dissent the internet would explode I remember that I remember I had to pick up the pieces had to call the P yeah they were sweeping the Internet these shores off the floor I mean just as a very basic matter the woman doesn't trend on Twitter the Internet does not explode over her they're just crafting this narrative they say she's become a rock star she the only time that she really went viral on the Internet is when she fell asleep during the State of the Union sure you know do they even know what the word notorious means it's not a good thing you know I think they're I think they're owning it these days yeah they have this video of her working out they saw that so she's working and they have this young fit instructor and he says oh she's like a cyborg she's like a machine see she does 20 push-ups a day they talk but then they film the pushup she lowers her body you know half an inch I'm not saying look she's an older one hundred and twelve years old hundred and twelve years old but and then they say oh and they're real push-up she's doing she's not she's not doing she's barely moving her body holding these weights that are two-pound I like when I like when they put her they have a picture of her doing a plank and my first thought is how long has she been in that position because if it's over six months where does his core strength and I River more again you know and the other thing is during his court hearings they say that Kavanagh exposed himself as too partisan Oh to partisan this woman has been openly partisan for her entire career pre-confirmation post-confirmation Bush v Gore she was one of just two justices who voted not to stop the recount Wow you know everybody thinks Bush v Gore was a 5-4 decision ultimately the decision that ended the question of the presidential election was five four the decision to stop the recount with seven two it wasn't even close and she was in those that two minority she's been on the radical side of countless cases but then in the 2016 election she called Donald Trump a faker she said she would move to New Zealand if he was right that's right I remember that sure she was out and out campaigning for Hillary Clinton campaigning against Donald Trump and she's not going to recuse herself from any decisions that have to of course not but you never hear that she is too partisan to you they want to have it both ways they can't pick a lane so they say she's too partisan but we love her because she's too poor she's not too partisan we love her cause she's too partisan and but brick Kavanagh has to withdraw himself so now this raises the question though all of this stuff is suddenly coming up obviously she's Ruth Bader Ginsburg's coming to the end of her term here on earth I don't say yes no one no one lives forever and so not I wish her well item not wishing you ill on her but I'm just saying at some point things come the curtain comes down why is all of this stuff coming up now what is the argue what is the secret or is everything that the left does always says the secret argument about why they should have power what is the secret argument behind a hagiography of Ruth Bader Ginsburg well they're they're creating this fiction that justice should be replaced by someone who is exactly like them this is in some Republicans have even bought into this so now I don't remember this when Merrick garland was put up for the really really when does this who what right we're in his right mind would buy into that of course it's absurd but they're they're passing it off as true they're making their movies and so and we have to forget history as recent as two years ago we have to forget about garland to going up to replace Scalia but they're trying to set this up so that if you thought this Kavanagh fight was bad just wait until a me koni Barrett is up to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg they're trying to set that up they're also trying to use the possible vacancy on for the Democrats the way that Republicans used it in 2016 president Trump may have one because Antonin Scalia died when he did and then because cocaine Mitch behaved the way he did postponing that that filling that seat I wonder if this new thing about white women this aim did Amy Barrett too I mean I mean I only supporting me about because she's just so hot but the question you've got to ask is look I don't like Sandra Day O'Connor but where's the Sandra Day O'Connor movie right or where's the Antonin Scalia movie or where's the Clarence Thomas movie they make movies about Clarence Thomas but they're about I need a hill why is that what that's on us right I mean we're not making those movies yes and no look this movie is very stupid may mean several minutes of it or just Ginsburg watching clips of Saturday Night Live praising her and her giggling at them then you have clips of her granddaughter talking about boobie you know cooking in the kitchen for like a significant portion of this movie so part of it is I think the right is not is easily emotionally manipulated we're not as you know this is sentimental propaganda tripe and I think we're not really moved by that we don't really require that to motivate us but still people remember the movies these movies have really lasting after JFK has lasting effects right so it I think it would behoove us to do it also because conservative as you've been saying now for decades these conservatives will not spend money on the Arts now they just don't get it they they're always there's always an emergency they're always a fire they're rushing to put out what are you talking about on your show today we're gonna talk about the the breaking news today Elizabeth Warren finally admitting that she's ninety nine point nine percent will obviously be guzzling a lot of these tears because she might be trying to raise heat big wampum on this bitch or not not a heat big percentage Native American you know you have you have tormented her people long and not null it's like the arrows will fly I can't wait thanks a lot Michael I appreciate it alright see ya you know before we get to our crappy culture I have to just point out this this whole thing about me too is actually like a a backup of stuff that has been stuffed down because of the need to defend Bill Clinton and his errant wife and they're silencing of women they're silencing of women who accused him of rape of accusing and there was a cut of Hillary Clinton being asked about whether bill should have resigned his cut number 11 just play this from it in retrospect do you think bill should have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan it wasn't an abuse of power no no there are people who look at the incidents of the 90s and they say a President of the United States cannot have a sensual relationship with an intern the power imbalances - was an adult but let me ask you this where's the investigation of the current incumbent against whom numerous allegations have been made in which he dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and it as I believe came out in the right place see this is incredible ignorant that has been sold to you your ignorance is being sold to you by that that is not what the Monica Lewinsky scandal was about the Monica Lewinsky scandal was about Paula Jones who was selected by Governor Bill Clinton's you know state trooper who would protect him and he would come and follow Paula Jones and bring her up to his hotel room whereupon bill would chase her around with his pants off with his pants open exposing himself to her and she sued him for it because she didn't want to be used by Bill Clinton she sued him for it and he lied about it if he hadn't lied about it if he hadn't lied about what he did to Paula Jones none of this would have happened during the testimony he was forced to testify about Monica Lewinsky and not only does he lie about it under oath he suborned perjury by causing her to lie about it to submit a statement about it that was untrue and causing all his his the people around him lying to them abusing his power by lying to them said that they went and lied for him that was what the scandal was about the scandal was about perjury it was not about whether he could be he was a slimeball for using his immense power to have an affair with a 20-something year old girl but that's not what the scandal was the scandal was the perjury and they just are pushing that ignorance on you so you forget what it's all about our crappy culture you know there's a trial starting that we really want to pay a little bit of attention to Harvard University is on trial oral arguments begin on Monday for students for fair admissions versus Harvard University Harvard is accused of systematically discriminating against Asian American applicants and college admissions they don't want that asian-americans study so hard work so hard do so well academically that Harvard doesn't want their you know the Yellow Peril to take over the school so they've been basically slanting their admissions process to keep them out and that is what's happening they're being sued for it and the question is that is going to end up being decided I think eventually is whether or not we can have this racist system that the left has imposed on it it is affirmative action it is you you can't cure racism with racism you cannot cure racism with racism so by using affirmative action which is racist and this is the first thing by the way the first thing was the backi case that alerted me to the fact that my liberal left-wing leanings were wrong this is the first very first thing that when I saw the backing case come in and affirmative action starting I thought nope they are just adopting the racism that has been in place for so long you cannot cure it why do they want to do this I think one of the reasons is once you start getting rid of the racism excuse oh you can't say that be you can't criticize Obama because it's racist you can't criticize a black man kneeling for the flag because it's racist you can't criticize but once they do that they have to deal with behaviors because the fact is the behaviors of black people and white people who are in poverty are virtually the same and those behaviors if you fix those behaviors or at least educate people out of those behaviors you start to educate people out of poverty and they don't become dependent on the government and they don't really vote for the left quite as much and that's what they don't want to do the racism has got to go and we on the right should stand against it at every single level there is no excuse for it it is on American it is unchristian it is unjú is it is wrong it is wrong to to judge people according to the that's that's it that's the whole question is it right or wrong to judge people according to the color of their skin wrong anytime they do it any time they do it is going to be harmful to the country in the long run and possibly in the short run I hope Harvard gets nail for this I hope they get now I'll see you
