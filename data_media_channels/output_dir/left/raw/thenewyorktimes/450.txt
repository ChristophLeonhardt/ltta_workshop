1
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:55,038
I am Poison Eve and
I am getting ready for

2
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,164
the 27th annual “Night of 1,000 Stevies”
at Irving Plaza.

3
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:04,212
This year's theme is Garbo,
and I will be performing

4
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:08,578
the title track for the 
theme song this year,

5
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:11,694
which is one of Stevie’s
rarities, called “Garbo.”

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,210
“Night of 1,000 Stevies” started 27 years
ago at the infamous night club

7
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,520
Jackie 60 in the
meatpacking district.

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,650
I've been attending the
“Night of 1,000 Stevies”

9
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,630
for about 23 years
and been actively

10
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,978
involved in performing
and D.J.ing since 1999.

11
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,888
Here, my boyfriend Jeff,
who is hairdresser, is

12
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:41,702
slapping on my wig, and
he’s going to glue it down,

13
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,954
because I’m wearing this
incredible three-foot

14
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,134
headdress later
this evening.

15
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:10,086
The song I performed, “Garbo,”
was sort of a dedication or a memorial

16
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:14,740
to one of the original Stevies,
Art L’hommedieu, who was my boyfriend

17
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,002
at the time. He passed away in 1999.
So this performance was

18
00:02:18,006 --> 00:00:00,000
was an ode to him and to the
gypsies that remain, as they say.
