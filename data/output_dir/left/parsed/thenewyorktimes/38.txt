A long, long time ago
back in the late 1991s
we put Anita Hill before
our esteemed committee.
“In fact, he never did
ask you to have sex.”
And boy oh boy,
we learned a lot.
“As one of those 98 men
in the United States Senate,
I say we owe you a
debt of gratitude.”
Back then we only had
two women in the Senate.
So, the only way to understand
or empathize with a woman
was by proximity.
“I couldn’t help but think
of my own four daughters.”
“I thought too of my daughter.”
“I just remember as a young
boy and my mother telling me about …”
These were serious accusations
and we took them seriously.
“This F.B.I. investigation, which
was a very right thing to do,
and it was a good
investigation.”
Our sensitivity at the
hearing captured the nation.
“… do solemnly swear …”
And as a result, we inspired
the 1992’s “Year of the Woman.”
And wouldn’t you
know, a wave of women
ran for office in 1992.
And incredibly, we tripled
our female representation
from two to six.
Some of us never give up.
Thirty years on the front
lines of progress.
And look at us now.
We’ve heard the people 
and learned from history.
“I want to treat Dr. Ford 
as if she were my daughter.”
“Or my mother.”
“I think she’s mistaken.”
“Why didn’t somebody call
the F.B.I. 36 years ago?”
“Unless there’s something more,
no, I’m not going to ruin
Judge Kavanaugh’s life
over this.”
“He’s a gem.”
“We’re going to plow
right through it.”
We even found a way to avoid
embarrassing internet mash-ups
of us looking foolish.
“We have hired a female
assistant to go on staff
and to ask these questions in a
respectful and professional
way.”
Today, we’re proud of our 23
female senators, ranking us
103rd worldwide 
in terms of women
in national legislature.
Look out, Sudan!
If you’re impressed
by our progress,
remember, we have
no term limits.
So keep voting us in.
