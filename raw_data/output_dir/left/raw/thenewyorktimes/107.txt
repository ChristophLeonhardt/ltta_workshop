1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,970
America is a place where
people have freedom

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,040
to move where they want, to
work, to be close to family,

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,690
and build the life they want.

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,620
At least that’s how
it’s supposed to be.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,400
But people with disabilities
can be denied that freedom

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,040
and end up in the
disability trap.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,330
This is me.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,000
I’m a documentary filmmaker.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,030
I may have a severe disability,
but I strive to be independent.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,720
In the year 2006,
I was diagnosed

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,650
with multiple sclerosis.

12
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,720
My most recent film was
about my life since then.

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,239
M.S. is a neurological disease
where your white blood

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,300
cells attack your nerve
endings, separating

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,430
your brain from your body.

16
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,986
Consequently, there’s a
gradual decay in your mobility.

17
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:17,810
The film premiered at the
Sundance Film Festival.

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,850
Later, one of my dreams came
true when the film won an Emmy.

19
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,087
And the winner goes
to “When I Walk."

20
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:28,823
[applause]

21
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,750
This award is dedicated to
all people with disabilities

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,820
from around the world
that are putting

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,416
their stories on screen.

24
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,350
[applause]

25
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,115
Soon after the film premiered,
another of my dreams

26
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:46,398
came true, when my
son Jay was born.

27
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,110
What are you going to do today?

28
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,600
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,120
I watched Jay grow up all the
way to his third birthday.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,580
And then he was gone.

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,310
Things were not working out
between his mother and me.

33
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,030
As many as 50 percent of couples
where one spouse has

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,600
a disability end in separation.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,462
The other person is more prone
to depression or caregiver

36
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:21,962
burnout.

37
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:30,638
[sobbing]

38
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:33,010
She decided to leave.

39
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,520
She found a job far away from my
life in New York City in Texas.

40
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,580
I need to find a way
to be closer to my son.

41
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,324
Even though it may be
difficult, I need to try.

42
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:26,988
[baby talk]

43
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,420
Our life dreams are sometimes
pulled away from us.

44
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,980
Good morning.

45
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,100
My symptoms have gone
from bad to worse

46
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,120
since they’ve been gone.

47
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:57,440
[cat meowing]

48
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,250
[distorted voice]

49
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,680
I can’t use my
upper body anymore.

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,040
I can’t even open my hands.

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,350
And my vision is
extremely blurry.

52
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,647
[doorbell ringing]

53
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:18,146
Hey!

54
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:19,079
Good morning, Jason.

55
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,815
At least I still
live independently.

56
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:23,090
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

57
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,370
I have a rotating crew of carers
covered by New York Medicaid.

58
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,110
They have become my friends
and creative collaborators.

59
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,275
Every day at 8 p.m., they
have a change in shift.

60
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,200
Bye.

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,700
Goodbye.

62
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,230
Why don’t you start, Jason,
by introducing yourself.

63
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,170
Living at home allows
me to pursue my dreams —

64
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,540
my filmmaking, my
nonprofit, and being a voice

65
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,760
for people with disabilities.

66
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,210
So this is Sabina.

67
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,110
Losing this independence would
be the end of my filmmaking,

68
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,520
the end of my activism,
and the end of me.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,690
But losing my son has made
the past year and a half

70
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,500
impossible.

71
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,230
[Skype ringing]

72
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,140
Happy birthday.

73
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,100
If I’m going to have a real
relationship with my son,

74
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,745
I have to move to Texas.

75
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,600
My mother comes for a
visit to support and help

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,470
me gain some perspective.

77
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,760
Do you want to live
in Austin, Texas?

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,990
I would live in Austin, Texas,
if it was OK to live there.

79
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,160
It’s a no-brainer.

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,192
You’ve got to be where
the health care is there.

81
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:49,150
But it’s like — but I
don’t even have a choice.

82
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,437
There is no but.

83
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,520
But I don’t have a choice.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,636
This is your choice.

85
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,510
You have a choice to
live independently here,

86
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,160
or you return to being
institutionalized.

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,280
Or be by my son.

88
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,870
Do what you love to do,
filming documentaries,

89
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,512
because life is short.

90
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:08,200
And then we die anyway.

91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,180
I want to be around
my son, but I

92
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,765
need to find the same care
I get here in New York.

93
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,300
I start doing research on state
rankings for their Medicaid

94
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,860
programs.

95
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,700
These rankings are based
on how states treat

96
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,960
their people with disabilities.

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,830
Medicaid support is
completely state-run.

98
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,300
State by state, there’s no
consistency for supporting people

99
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,560
with disabilities.

100
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,870
While New York is in
the top 15 overall,

101
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,110
it’s number one specifically
for reaching people

102
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,680
with disabilities in need,
while Texas is dead last.

103
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,650
I attempt to get
the same health care

104
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,962
I get in New York in Texas.

105
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:56,868
[ringing]

106
00:06:58,227 --> 00:06:59,160
Yeah, that’s right.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,466
I started looking at the
states surrounding Texas.

108
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:18,590
If I can’t live
in Texas, at least

109
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,092
I can try and live
in a bordering state.

110
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:22,034
[ringing]

111
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,043
[ringing]

112
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,370
Oh.

113
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,820
The opposite of living 
independent at home

114
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,284
is living in a nursing home.

115
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:09,450
This is going to hurt a bit.

116
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,530
A nursing home would
restrict my daily living.

117
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,980
I would have no control of
what time I wanted to leave

118
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,350
or what time I went to bed.

119
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,320
Anything beyond the
basic necessities

120
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,450
would be extinguished.

121
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,710
No work, no
independence, no freedom.

122
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,380
The health care
situation looks bleak,

123
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,408
but there has to be a way.

124
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:45,160
I go to Texas to find out
more about living near my son.

125
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,600
I want to cheer for him
after his first soccer goal.

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,590
I want to watch him
get slide tackled

127
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,550
and take him out
for ice cream after

128
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,730
so I can explain to them
that sometimes life hurts.

129
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,800
But you always have to remember,
you have to pick yourself up.

130
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,570
Here we go.

131
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,040
I interview others with severe
disabilities living in Texas.

132
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:24,299
I have a traumatic brain injury
caused by a motor vehicle

133
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,690
accident.

134
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,850
We’re proud to be Texans,
but we’re not necessarily

135
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,150
as proud of some of the
shortfalls on programs

136
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,620
for disabled people.

137
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,814
We were in a car accident —

138
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:36,820
how long ago?

139
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,741
2008.

140
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,490
It looked like there
was life in her eyes,

141
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,540
but no life in her body.

142
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,970
You cannot get 24/7 care.

143
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,980
I don’t buy it.

144
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,530
I’m not buying this whole
national and state mindset.

145
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,990
We represent people with
disabilities, who are generally

146
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,540
considered the lowest-income
demographic group

147
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,740
in our society.

148
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,350
If someone does relocate
to a different state,

149
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,810
there should be at least no
interruption of services,

150
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,080
if there’s some sort of
smooth continuity of services.

151
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,470
So in my situation, to be closer
to my son, who’s in Texas —

152
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,130
I live in New York —

153
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,480
is there any solution?

154
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,206
Or am I just stuck?

155
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:24,688
[sighing] It’s almost like
you’d have to reconfigure

156
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:26,680
your life entirely, Jason.

157
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,740
Because I just can’t see
that you could come here,

158
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,570
be close to your son, and
find yourself in a position

159
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,650
that the only way you
can get the care you need

160
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,340
is to go into a nursing home.

161
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,390
And you’d find yourself, again,
isolated from the child you

162
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,880
want to be close to.

163
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,620
I don’t have words to
describe how sad this is.

164
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,470
I should be able
to live near my son

165
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,290
without giving up my
reason for living.

166
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,080
Is that so much to ask?

167
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,750
Why should people with
disabilities like mine

168
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,040
be forced to make these
impossible choices?

169
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,360
But I’m willing to
investigate anything.

170
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,660
So with no option left, I check
myself into a nursing home.

171
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,180
The staff here
are professionals.

172
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,407
They do an O.K. job, but I
have no freedom of movement.

173
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:34,906
One.

174
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:35,832
Two.

175
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,684
Three.

176
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:39,540
O.K.

177
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,940
No way to do my work or
continue my activism.

178
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,640
Good morning!

179
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,610
Basically, I’m just
put into storage.

180
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:03,004
Nope.

181
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:09,976
What do you mean?

182
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:16,729
Regular liquids.

183
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,818
I just can’t do it.

184
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:27,049
I want to say to you
that I want to be here with you,

185
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:31,041
but I would die a slow death.

186
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:36,029
So … sorry, but I’m not going
to be able to do this.

187
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,029
[sobbing] See you later.

188
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,138
I wish more than
anything that I didn’t

189
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,770
have to choose between
the two things that

190
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:53,290
make my life meaningful:
my son and my life’s work.

191
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,250
But the differences
between the care

192
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,990
I get in New York
and Texas forces

193
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,620
me to live where I can get the
health care I need and continue

194
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,120
my career.

195
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,830
This hurts.

196
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,055
Nobody ought to be forced
to make these choices.

197
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,570
No matter how far
away we are, my son,

198
00:13:17,570 --> 00:00:00,000
I will never abandon you.
