1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,400
Picking the right pair of headphones for you can be tough.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,200
You have to think about how much they cost,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,140
what they look like, how way they fit on your head.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,140
And obviously, you care about the sound.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,220
Plus there are tons of brands that make them

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,340
The pair of wireless headphones that checks the most boxes for me

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,240
are the Sennheiser HD 1 wireless over ears.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,520
The sound quality is wonderful.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,660
base beats feel full and satisfyingly thunky,

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,620
middle notes are clean and bright.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,340
And scratchy sounds or whispers have a very satisfying texture.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,500
The noise-cancelling on the headphones is also really great.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,280
If you’re walking on the street you won’t hear the people around you,

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,660
but if there’s a siren that goes by, you will hear that. As in you will hear the important things.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,140
The one thing about the noise cancelling is that you can’t turn it on and off,

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,760
once it connects to your phone, it’s on. That might be a drawback for some people.

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,200
The materials are excellent.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,880
All of the soft parts are sheaved in this creamy dark leather.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,220
The cup pads are incredibly squishy and marshmallowy,

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,420
they feel really great along the side of your head.

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,360
And they don’t have that super firm grip that some headphones have.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,760
The Bluetooth is totally seamless and totally easy.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,680
It just takes one touch to link it with your phone.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
Once you’re listening to music, the volume button also is the pause button and the skip ahead button.

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,920
You can feel it very easily without looking.

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,980
The set remains charged for up to 22 hours.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,180
The Bluetooth range is remarkable I actually tested it out and I walked an entire city block away from my phone

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,100
and I had no disruption in any of the noise.

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,720
It will skip a little bit that’s how you know you’re at the end of your range,

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,020
but, a whole city block worth of bluetooth range is pretty good.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,700
Fair warning,

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,300
All this quality comes at a price.

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,520
If you’re looking for a good pair of wireless headphones, it's gonna run you between $120 and $500.

34
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,600
The HD 1s are $499.95.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,340
They are right at the tippy top of the range.

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,360
But

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,900
for the build quality,

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,280
the easy technology,

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,180
the great sound, and I think the overall handsomeness,

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:00:00,000
these are worth the investment
