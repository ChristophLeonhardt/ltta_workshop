Jennifer Lawrence has captivated her audience for years and whether it be from oscar-winning performances too quirky impromptu interviews to political statements that make you question your sanity and grip on reality itself well j-law is allegedly taking time off her coveted career to quote fix our democracy not all heroes wear capes some wear extensions I'm Ben Davies is pure Hollywood maybe he was a childhood calling walking around DC looking up with these incredible monuments of our forefathers or maybe it was the year she didn't spend in high school studying civics in our Constitution either way this calling for complex governmental structure reform has fully been realized that's right Jay law is taking a break from her taxing and burdensome career of being the top paid female actress in the world two years in a row even going as far as comparing her role in The Hunger Games for those years to that of slavery please let me know where I can sign up for this oppression recently in an interview with a Jennifer Lawrence said she was taking a break from acting for about a year to work with represent us an organization focused on ending government corruption and empowering youth she claims that the organization is no political leaning whatsoever and I really do hope that that's true and will do what its claiming to set out to do because Jennifer Lawrence may be in for a rude awakening who said that she would never vote Republican because their stance against women's rights ie abortion that's it however if corruption is truly what they're going after and what she is going after I say go for it maybe she'll discover the open corruption in the 2016 Democratic primary this has been shown by both WikiLeaks and former DNC head chair Donna Brazile I guess the Democratic establishment just wasn't feeling the Bern maybe she'll get into the IRS Obama scandal where literally Obama was using one of the most powerful organizations in the entire land to target political opponents literally our government being wielded as a weapon to secure political prominence or that currently all the evidence for Russian collusion seems to be closing in on the Hillary campaign and not the Trump campaign honestly I think that Jay Weezy is a fantastic actress and I really hope she enjoys all for time off and finds fulfillment and that the mission statement of represent us is actually found because there is truly a treasure trove of corruption the government on both sides which is why we don't need it to be any more powerful or need more of it however if you think currently the corruption is equal on both sides let me ask you this why would a candidate without the aid of the RNC who went against every single Republican establishment person who used his own campaign finances who had no backers going into it become the leader of the Republican Party how would that been possible all the while the DNC had a known coup to swing Hillary the entire primary yeah sometimes reality speaks a lot louder than CNN Headline I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content and the entire rebel lineup you
