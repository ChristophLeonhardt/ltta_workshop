sorry used to explain University wishing to reach the female what's that mean Tommy we all saw you get in the back of that police car that police truck what happened after that so everyone saw visibly I was arrested for breach of the peace what fine surprising is no one's ever mentioned breach of the peace no one's ever mentioned the fact that's what I was arrested for a restful breach the peace and I was driven to lead Ellen Road police station so a 10-minute Drive from the core I was I got to the police station now anyone who's been arrested knows the first thing they do is they take you to the front desk where you're booked in for your crime you asked if you want your solicitor and then you're put in a cell to wait for your interview this was different straight away I wasn't booked into the police station I was held in a side room at the police station for probably 40 minutes which throw else thinking what the police stations not gonna be busy some more it's not it's in the morning and I was then taken to the front desk and told on being moved to court I'm being taken straight to call again I asked for breach of the peace they said no for contempt of court so then they took me in a police we're in a police wagon in the back of the court and I was taken to the courtroom what actually transpired is that now when people have to ask why this happened in this way because if they'd have arrested me outside the court for contempt of court and everyone would have known I've been arrest for contempt of court because my lists are contacted the police station as soon as been arrested I said I want this list they spoke with my solicitor and the police station told Melissa told much less Allison guerdon I was being released I wasn't released so I and then when I when I arrived at the core I again asked my legal multiple times I said I want to speak with my Lissa was told I couldn't speak much less up now if my sister had if there wasn't a breach of the peace not just been arrested for content to call my sister would have known to send send a representative to the core but they refused me point-blank I was not allowed the opportunity to speak with my solicitor so why did they tell your solicitor that you had been released if you had not been released did you ever walk free of the police station or the courthouse no I was transported I was tried for it straight from the police station in the van straight into court strains herself of course and then refused the opportunity to speak my lawyers and up before the judge I stood before the judge where he watched I'd say seven minutes of the video remember was over an hour long right he watched seven minutes I was then put back down in the cell still I was asking for my solace almost Lissa I was in a prepared lawyer that was at the court was then put before me where I told him again I won't speak to my solicitor so this was a public defender a public defender who I asked again can I speak to my solicitor and I asked him what is he I've said what is he I've done I was not told he just said contempt of court I said but what it's still still sitting here now bearing in mind I'm gonna face another trial in a few weeks I've still not been told what I've said in fact this trial was supposed to happen today on the 4th of September the reason it's been put back is because they still haven't told me what it is in that hour-long video that breach iskcon's to contempt a core can I take you back to when you first met the judge and he watched five or seven minutes of the video did he ask you any questions or say anything or did you just sit there while he watched it I saw that what I watched it I made it clear that if there was a problem I'd delete it if there's a problem with it I would delete it instantly if there was a problem and I think there lots of people have read so many things I remember getting to prison and reading reading in reports that I pled guilty I was never asked if I was going or not going I was never asked I was never told what crime are commit so bear in mind I know this I know what's happened in court I know that I'd ask can you not get churned so that I can speak with a QC in fact that come out in my appeal because in the defendants notes it said that I'd asked and said I want to speak to a QC and I was sentenced to 30 months in prison so the first time he went before the judge and he reviewed the video did you have your public defender lawyer with you they no no I have no one with me so then when you were given this public defender did you appear before the judge a second time I did before the judges second time where where the the defense the defense man said they basically if he went up and apologized then let's say we went through previous cases for exact so that people understand like Jamie boulders killers live under a court order no one can name them people have named them they've been before core no one's ever been put in prison little by little he's a reporter for Sunday Times he breached a report and restriction on the Stephen Lawrence murder trial he apparently nearly jeopardized the trial he was given a fine no one if you go through the law so as well if you if you read the law on contempt of court which which which was so disheartening for me and so I'd been put in prison I'm saying prison I'm reading all of these newspaper reports not one journalist no one for to go and get the transcripts from that core to go and find out what was sitting that call if anyone would have done that that have instantly see no I did not plead guilty though I was not given a fair trial there was over in minutes they'd have seen all of this I thought you had pled guilty because I read that in so many newspapers I assumed you did either under bad advice or a no advice did the judge ask you whether or not you admitted or to anything did did he ask you any questions no you asked many questions no I didn't open my mouth the whole time did the judge particular eyes anything you said or did wrong and he said you said this word or you did that thing not nothing actually what what comes out is that he section 4 6 & 4 is the reporting restrictions the judge had per reporting restriction on this case now anyone again just go and read the law it's what I did I previously gone four days of training on contempt of court I read the law the law states that the judge has no power to put any reporting restriction on any information that's already in the public domain now everything go I said outside call that day was already in the public domain oh I knew things I still know things about that case about results of that case I still know lots of things that I've never mentioned because I was aware you could have mentioned them but the judge and then when the judge sends me so he sends me apparently for breach in the reporting restriction but then in his word support he sends me for which come out in the High Court of Appeal it was more to the fact that I was mentioning that there were Muslim and it so it seemed and he talked about me the risk of me prejudice in the trial well that's not the section for that he sentenced me under he sent me under basely breach and reform restriction and so that all the people read all the thing saying I risked the trial I've read all of this the trial had finished I would do nothing I would do nothing that I thought could jeopardize these trials isn't it would go against everything I stand for when everything called won the trial had finished well I stood outside court I made sure that I did in fact video any members of the jury because I know you can't any members of the public I literally the crime that I was sent to prison for was breaching a report on restriction and two weeks after I was sent to prison obviously I'm reading everything I read the Scottish Telegraph newspaper breach to reporting restrictions a weeks after I went to jail they again we go to the laws the law and the advisory to the government is that they should not send and he if anyone preaches a reporting restriction it shouldn't even be the individual journalist who gets done it should be the company they work for and they strongly advise that all it should be is a fine now as everyone seen I was sent to prison did your lawyer the public defender who was assigned to you did he indicate that he had any experience with contempt of court was he familiar with your legal history no he just indicated that we start with down one up said the judge did he ask for a delay of a week or two did he ask for any time for you to prepare for him to prepare know how long were you actually in the court for 10 minutes in fact they were desperate to do it before lunch lunch would have been 1 o'clock they were desperate to have for lunch I was still arguing the point with everybody that I wanted speaks most letters and so when over lunch if not I'd have been sent to prison before lunch before 1 o'clock did he listen then they broke for the hour lunch so when they broke through the hour lunch then then I was again saying I just want to speak to my solicitor did you ask the judge for a delay or for the ability to speak to your own lawyer no I didn't open my mouth I didn't get a chance to speak so the you asked the police I asked the police I asked to call tribes I asked the the person who come I'll press the button on my cell once which is all documented yeah well press the button to come to my cell said I need to speak to Melissa I need to speak to my solicitor nice they said this has been put in front of me yeah by the state essentially a solicitor that I trust us this I know that I know he's going to work for my best interest that's all I want to speak to did anyone else speak in your hearing did any court police there was a picture of circulating on the internet of some people looking down from a brick building I don't know if that was the judge of course police services judge and the police arrested me so that was the judge when I was outside court which I did not wasn't aware of until I come out that was the judge watching down as and then the police come down and arrested me did they say anything in court no no nothing and then and then the other thing is if you read the law again I can't believe journalists have not done this if you read the law the law specifically states that because content of core gives to judges there's no laws like this in America and other countries contempt of court gives the judges so much power to themselves they can arrest someone try them convict them and sentence them there's no jewelry so you know I'm not going to be found guilty by 12 members of the British public while I'm up before a judge a judge who things I've done them and a judge who deems what sentence he can give me now because of the amount of power that gives a judge then under the law the contempt of court law that judge under no circumstances whatsoever that's the wording of it Kanpur any restrictions or reporting restrictions on the public being told what has happened if he sent in someone under contempt of court and that's what happened he instantly made it he and instantly said the reporting restrictions no one is allowed to know what's happened were there reporters in that courtroom I understand there was someone from the Leeds local newspaper there is none made any comment none of them said a word which is why I'll send a prison and then I started reading that because of some of these newspapers then challenge that reporting restriction a week later what my point is entirely on this reporting restriction so people are saying that it wasn't a high risk giving someone a fair trial these reporting restrictions have been put on every Muslim grooming gang trial case now if they wasn't put in place then every day the British public would be fed the news stories of what these men are doing to these girls for example in some cases they took a twelve-year-old girl with a claw hammer when they got her pregnant they stuck the program up her and they killed the kid yeah they killed the baby in other circumstances they got hot iron rod and they stamped a young eleven while going about these sort of sadistic racially motivated and religiously motivated crimes the comments all of the stuff from this case would be played down each day by putting a reporting restriction on the case which is what they do you know every years where for trials there's another trial sign tomorrow you have another 31 people there's trials going on across this country every week but they put these restrictions so then what happens is no one can talk yeah no one can talk about what's happening in court and they say it's so that the other people can have a fair I don't understand what difference it makes now what more is these laws I'd say are any freedom laws their laws prevent in 60 million people in this country reading and knowing what's happening each day their job should be to prevent the jewelry the 12 members of the British public if you need to prevent people hear and understand things it's them when you become a member of the jury you're told I've seen in court many times you're not allowed to go on the internet you're not allowed to research is you're criminally not allowed to look at videos you're not allowed to look at anything to do with this trial or you go to jail so they're not allowed to so why are these conditions put on that then prevent daily news stories where would be here in the story basically they lift the reporting restriction at the end of the trial and you you'll get one day's news one day's news about the horrific torture of hundreds of young children the horrific that the circumstances the reasons the the comments from the men the perpetrators doing it all of these things there to put under a restriction from the public hearing we've reset and it's not just this I see that recently in in London we had a case of terrorism where the public have not been allowed to know at all which is a national security what the men were doing what fine they were planning to do to members of the British public now it's said that I've seen so many things like this where I'd say our secret courts in Britain and I've seen that in the grooming in the Muslim grooming gangs where the rape jihad trials they're going on across this country these same tactics and I'm yet to uh so I've asked mine I've asked multiple lawyers tell me me standing outside trial I made sure to say those men an innocent till proven glue it gooey or I made sure to main room prom and respectful I simply asked them how they felt about their verdict the public watch as whether it be Rolf Harris whether it be other groups whenever anyone else walks into court every time I walk into call or I'm bombarded a lot with cameras and questions and comments every time but then for some reason for these Muslim grooming contra Olson no one's allowed to speak I I was actually watching your Facebook live stream bad day may 25th from Canada yeah and I remember when you read the names of some of the accused men and I think you were reading them from a BBC website is that correct I'm from a baby new baby see website there's a there's lots of so everything I just read out it's a did you tell that to the judge because if how could you reading something off a BBC website this is being published at the same time how could that be condemned in court this is the problem the judge hasn't told us what what was contempt of court so he sends me to prison without without needing to tell anyone did you go into the trial at all did you go and sit in and listen to the trial no when I got to call that morning when I got to call that morning this is the other thing that if you read the the guidelines for the core and for judges when they put reporting restrictions on the case they must be visible on the door of the court and they must be visible on the screen I went into court at morning I questioned about reporting restrictions that morning before he asked well I asked the man at reception he said he didn't know I then looked on the screen which had the defendants names and there's nothing on the screen of reporting restriction okay I have a photograph of this okay then when he put the report when he when he sends me then and only then they changed the screen the reason I asked if you sat in the court yes is if you didn't sit in the court you couldn't say anything that was going on in the court you were just outside giving general opinions and reading from the BBC well did you I don't recall you saying anything that would say I made sure that I didn't say anything that wasn't in the public domain every bit of information I gave was on websites now if the reporting restriction that the police want to put in then they need to go contact the BBC all the national newspapers they need to go content or anyone because any member of the jewelry everything I said and he managed or you could have sound the computer and read but the judge has no power to put reporting restrictions on any information that that's the law which again are again I have all these experts and these secret barristers and these journalists and politicians and all of them send in our generic response that I pleaded guilty that's why I'm in prison and I deserve to be because I risked practices in the trial a trial had already finished that the jurors were there to give their verdict the handi never give them resolve their verdict I I've seen other Mohan Singh a friend of yours did a video in front of that same courthouse on another day saying very similar things he read the names also I've seen other British media have a flurry of interest in court case is really not much different than yours on that day did the judge refer to any precedent to the did he say anything about you and your history I was there anything in that hearing that day that would explain why he had such a fast trial and a heavy sentence given how other media and other citizen journalists are treated no what else transpires is that there was in the transcripts because that's what my solicitors waiting for which anyone can go get again journalists you can go get them get the transcript from the court case you'll see you'll see that although he sentenced me and he sentenced me as well for having a three month suspended sentence there was no mention of three months suspended sentence he done no research or mentioned in the court at all of finding out that I was on a three month suspended sentence he knew he knew without me mention it in the court no one mentioned it in the court he he knew and I'd say they were already know I know they were aware of my comments are made to me by police officers the police officer in charge of the grooming trial who come to see me after I was sinced they knew I was going to be add that courtroom then that movie that you sing the judge knew and no I can't say the judge me the police were aware the court police yeah so how cuz the police seized my phone so on top of this I was arrested for was breach of the peace and then they mentioned incitement that's what they mentioned to me now even after I was sent to prison for 30 months a lead officer from South Yorkshire police come and saw me in my print in myself and said give us the password for your phone and I said why cause we're seizing your phone I said what for he goes we're looking at I've never looking at other crimes of incitement did you give them them pass tomorrow I didn't know do you have your phone back yeah I don't know no they still have my phone and did he have a warrant for this is what I said you've been sending us under contempt of court under what grounds and I kept asking in this under walk grounds now anyone who doesn't know in the history this is South Yorkshire please South Yorkshire Police who illegally arrested me and raided my mum's and what and my house this is all this is all factual as well they've accepted they they sent their police officers on training courses in 2011 2010 actually in 2010 I was due to speak in South Yorkshire again about grooming and about the rape of young girls this is before it was public knowledge before everyone knew everything about these cases before everyone has accepted and admitted that the government and the police had conspired with religious leaders to allow this rape to happen before that was all public knowledge before the rubble and report before all these things South Yorkshire police obviously to be talking about what South flocks are placed it is they sent 30 police officers was the rest of the airport they then raided my mum's and made in my house they then give me bail conditions not to not to hold protests and the bail date they gave me was to prevent me talking so I have a long history with this same police force who have done anything they can to attempt to prevent me talking about these issues so he came and he came right to yourself he can't if they took me on my cell to see this police officer were you required to meet him or did you no no no they said and he and they took me into him and he was the lead police officer how long how long was that meeting five minutes I just said I'm on my way to prison yeah like what do you want from me let me get back to something you said earlier about you mentioned that a year ago I remember when your with the rebel there was a contempt of court case in Canterbury and there was a three-month suspended sentence there I just want to clarify you saying that that was never mentioned in the Leeds court never mentioned but so basically Mouse my lawyers when I spoke to miss Alyssa's it was they said on the transcripts as I mentioned if you're free mum contempts the house he got house he sent you on a free month contempt if there's no mention of it sounds like maybe there was some information some reviewing of information that wasn't said in cool yeah I'm side of court which it shouldn't have been I don't know I wasn't aware it should've been but from what I understand it should have been whilst we're on the the Canterbury Court case because I see so many people saying it's the second time he done it he's not learned his lesson content from my previous content of court there was a young girl who was lost and she went into a kebab shop and she asked for directions she was a child she was taken to a slab stairs by 5 min and raped in every hole she has okay now they found their DNA so these men one of the men fled to Afghanistan I believe that's where he's from or early beers from Afghanistan they they found their DNA so all five men's DNA were ever seen on the victim everywhere ok because she when she come out she was distraught these men were given bail now I was informed of this I went down to their takeaway was cool say it was good it was called triple 7 yeah this takeaway this is a bad shot where they rape the victim I then when they just change the name and then I heard that they've still run in his shop so I went and looked at the shop they all look they lock the doors they shut the shut the doors they were still run in the shop I checked the ownership name were on the leap on the system to see who owns the new company name it's the same man the man who's up for raping a child I then went and spoke with the business over the road and I spoke to customers of the business of the road saying have you seen any young girls in their shop and they said yes there was some some young schoolgirls in there yesterday your school-aged children in they sa so then so in my eyes ok and in fact in the whole British public's eyes these men should never been given bail yeah they shouldn't so I know that the judge will not like me for saying this but the judge left the British public and our daughters and our sisters for too long I've been at risk at risk again these men were on bail these men are all now serving 20 years in prison for the rape but at the time they weren't these men were freely still still in mixing with young children that their prep their business was still running they were still using the same premises and I went down there because I wanted to make a video which I said at the time that I want the public and I want everyone in that area to know who these men are and what their their alleged to have done now add that swine I wasn't sure of all the laws of contempt of court and I went there from my straight off a straight from my football heart that I was I was angry I was frustrated and I couldn't believe what I saw I saw that these men was still running the business he if there was a chance that they were gonna get not guilty for example if they didn't have all their DNA on the young child but they did have their DNA so more Minds I've been reminded people will be sitting watching this who get remanded into prison they don't get bail why are these men being given bail and in fact it's been proven that they were all guilty at the time but the judge took me before as soon as I went outside the core the judge let them use the back exit because she didn't want me that she want them to be at risk from me the five-minute of rape gang rape the child would be at risk from me putting a camera in their face you think so this was the case I can't be this when I was working you know the police raid in my house the next morning at 4:00 I've got half 4:00 in the morning and I was Jax before I was put before the judge and in my in my only the only reason I can see is that she knows that she failed in her duty to protect the bridge public she failed by giving them bail so she took me before her core and she sentenced me and even when I watch that video now there were things I said wrong on that video but I remember that when you were with the rebel we had a session at a senior law firm off to a gym Kingsley Napoli and we brought in a lot of lawyers and we went over contempt a court and other things that you as a citizen journalist should be careful of and so when I watched you in Leeds I was nervous admitted I was nervous but I thought okay he's careful he's not stepping on the court premises he's carefully saying accused rapist or alleged rapist he's not saying they're guilty in the training day we spend in the tree in the training days we spent to understand contempt of court which I didn't understand you're not allowed to stand encore I didn't understand at Canterbury you're not allowed to stand on the court proper and so you didn't that's contempt of court you didn't in Leeds I didn't actually ask the police officer wayde's where's the landline and he agreed so I didn't in lead I also every time why you speak of an offense you have to speak of an alleged offense yeah no matter how much evidence we know I knew those men would guilty as soon as I knew they did but you have to say alleged offense and you you check that box too I thought you've been very careful was very careful so what exactly so you still don't know what they put you away for because the judge never said he to this day do this thing that you don't know what you've said wrong no I've no idea I have no idea I'm about to stand the trial again in in a number of weeks still today we have not been told what is so I expect they'll throw on us a week before maybe they'll throw here's what we're saying breached the reporting restriction and burn in mind anyone can research this go look up Roger Lee those case he breached the Stephen Lawrence murder trial the murder trial nearly collapse The Spectator magnate spectator run the story now because they deleted it quickly okay because they removed it quickly he was given a few thousand pound fine but this is what their advices their voices so they don't seem I always say this word functor prone Ian so they don't cut the government don't come across as Ukranian they shouldn't be in prison in journalists I've even seen right now there's a massive firm there's a massive never contempt of law has been going for 70 years never ever has any journalist ever been put in prison it was shocking I want to ask you one last thing about that court hearing because you say with seven minutes that's incredible to me given that your video itself was more than an hour I hadn't watch the video it would have been impossible it would have been impossible for the judge to have watch the video it takes an hour to watch the video and if it watch the full video it has seen all of other steps and all the reasonable things I made and said the different interactions I had with the public I made sure that I stayed within the law or on what been well I've been to was within the law now contempt of court is not a crime there's no guilty mind it's a strict liability offense either did it or didn't even if he didn't mean to and you've already said in no way would you want to derail a trial and you said that you would have taken the video down if it if it were to put a trial at risk so there's clearly no guilty mind you obviously did not mean to disrupt the trial am i right of course from my understanding is that basically so reporting restrictions can be put on and there's no way of anyone knowing where these were what reporting restrictions are on and the government were advised in 2014 again anyone who reads up on this can find this they're advised that they must have a national website and that national website must inform journalists so that if for example I know there's a case starting tomorrow yeah it's a Kirklees Magistrates Court it's 31 min for the Oconee appeared for the first time very one Muslim men are going to appear for the first time for another huge gang rape again in the same city as the previous theory that I was reporting on in that same see now there's no website there's no way of checking whether there's restrictions there's no way of knowing yeah now the government would advise to set up a national website they haven't done that I hope that after this they set up a law which would tell the government and the court so they have to make it visible for journalists so I understand what they can and can't say when you were convicted did the judge in any way indicate the difference between being a criminal convict someone guilty of with some with a guilty mind who broke the law willingly versus civil contempt did the judge differentiate between the two in the sentence he issued no the judge didn't mention so I was in fact myself so for contempt of court you cannot be a criminal prisoner okay you're a civil prisoner and when it what's the difference in how a criminal prisoners civil treated so several prisoners have more rights civil prisoner have as many visits as you want so people can come in and visit you your family every day every day again anyone can read these facts also they're allowed to spend 50 pounds per week buying food buying toiletries buying wherever they want off the shopping system within the prison also so for my crime for the crime of contempt of court not even a crime you go to an open prison so you'd be in an open prison where you go home weekends yeah there's a category D offense a completely minimal completely zero risk offensive quip of contempt of court that's what the guidelines are that's what the criteria is that's how a prisoner should be held so a civil prisoner gets as many visits as he likes gets to spend fifty pounds a week on whatever you can buy food shopping and also and how far does 50 pounds go on a prison is it cheap no it goes well so the difference is when we get to the difference so I was putting to prison and I was held as a criminal prisoner now people may think that was a mistake yeah I was Ho as a criminal prisoner even though I can't possibly be held as a criminal prisoner because it's a civil crime even though which we have all the evidence of this my solicitors made the prisoner we're instantly he's been wrongly held if you're not like if you're holding him as a criminal prisoner with because I was only allowed to spend 12 pounds a week I will get why that's important in a minute why spending money was important in your case but why don't we pick up from when the judge issued the sins 13 months were you shocked yeah yeah I was gobsmacked I was gobsmacked but I was gobsmacked but at the same time at the same time for what has happened over the past ten years with myself it's not I know I known and if even if in the most recent demonstration when we had a day for freedom in London I was saying and I kept saying to everyone I wonder what they're going to do Nick to try and stop because they can see anyone can see them a momentum building the public are not listening anymore they're not buying the medias spin on things they're seeing the reality of the problems the country faces and the attempts to make me the most hated man in Britain have completely failed and I was worried I was very worried I've been very worried about what they're gonna do next I'm very worried now about what they're gonna do next because they're in and when I say they I mean the government like even well I was sent to prison and I've got 13 months and my previous prison sentences like in 2012 I received a ten month prison sentence and it was for illegally entering the United States from America now I get again everything I've done through my activism if it's morally right if I believe I'm morally right I believe boundaries need to be pushed to leave that if the moral argument and it's a moral cause we're fighting I knew when I I knew when I went to America I knew what I was doing was legally wrong but I felt that I had such an important message to give America to give the American public a warning to America I wish I wish that someone would have come to this country thirty years ago would have told them this is what's going to happen I'm telling you because I've lived for it I've watched my town I've watched the left align themselves with the Islamist groups I've watched them join in order for the vote bank of politics I watched the decay of freedom I've watched all of this growing up in Luton so I felt when I went to America that was an important message to give now I legally ended America I again I look the previous people who'd used a legal documentation for example Abu Qatada come into Britain on a false passport he was not put in prison okay I spent ten months I was put in British prison America did not prosecute me the bridge before he prosecuted me I had not actually broke in Britain because the crime I'll commit was in America but they reminded me I was reminded instantly so I was held on remand for three months before I got before a judge so and I was put in solitary confinement well I spent in 22 weeks on solitary confinement I was the legalities around that anything over 28 days is detrimental to your mental health to be isolated on your own now I was moved from ones worth not for mere prison here then to Bedford prison then to Woodhill prison then to back to Wandsworth prison then to Wayland prison and the whole entire time I saw no one at all on the entire prison sentence I did not come out of my cell now when I come out of my cell and I'll never spoke about this publicly because and the reasons for it when I come out I struggled big time I come out after five months of sitting on solitary confinement and I come out just go straight back into society and I struggled I struggled to cope a lot and I went to doctors and then I was diagnosed with having a post-traumatic stress disorder now the reason why I never spoke about it publicly but because it's embarrassing post minute stress disorder is something that men who fight wars get I'm locked in a room is that there can be no comparison in what those men are suffering for me to publicly try and talk about that whether the difference is this has done to you by the British prison system on purpose o purpose undoubtedly because they're not allowed to do it they're not allowed to but anyway this is from or this was for illegally entering I spent two days in New York I gave a speech where I wanted to warn America and I spent I spent five months in solitary confinement now I went I come out of prison and I went to prison in 2014 for a separate offense which was for a mortgage for two supposed mortgage fraud which again I'll get into this in the wall but when I went in that prison sentence I was locked in a room and had and was beaten with locked in a room with Muslim prisoners and I was beaten I've got all new teeth all my teeth and new because my teeth were smashed to pieces and but I wasn't planned so tree confinement yeah so I was then moved put into a jihadi jail in in England where I lasted five minutes before I was finally attacked and bad and then I was transported black and blue to another prison but the next prison I was transported to has a very young Muslim demographic I spent the six months of my prison sentence as a role model prisoner you know with Muslim prisoners I was nervous to them bar on my health records which everyone which the prison system have which the government have they they know the long term struggles I had after solitary confinement now this prison sentence I London HMP whole now I was worried we're now in the prison because I was in Leeds how forward go to Bradford is one of the biggest Muslim populations of our country or would go to that prison I was put how and because that prison was full I believe I was taken to whole and then I was put into normal location which is what I want I want to be treated normally I spread to normal occasion where I spent two days and after two days I was in that prison prisoner guards come to get me and said you're being moved now I believe this at the time Lord Mao Lord Lord Pearson had wrote a letter demanding my safety which I was grateful for book because I was on the I was on this induction wing no so that people understand when you get to prison if you ask for protection if you say I'm scared I need help then you'll be housed with the pedophiles yeah I'm never gonna do that ever it's never ever gonna was that happen then and they know that as well so I would never do that so because I've done nothing to deserve that and I'll end up hurting one on it so that's never gonna happen so I was pretty normal equation now when I was on the wing there were some Muslims there and our did sense that possibly the it could turn it could turn violent but there was so people understand out of a wing of a hundred prisoners there were seven Muslims seven percent of hey champ hijo ism is Muslim now the prison themselves made the decision to put me in the hospital every prison has a hospital or this prison had a hospital they put me in hospital where there were no Muslims and I was separated completely from the prison population when I had when my family got finally in to see me after three weeks three weeks yes after three weeks was when why my family got in got a visit but well let me ask you about that suit so all in the course of a few hours you were arrested tried convicted sentenced and shipped off to HMP Hall in what five hours father what less it is less than that because by the time they actually yeah listen when was the first time you talked to your wife so they give you a they give you a pound phone credit when you get to jail so I rang around my wife at that point so that night don't know yeah she busted me shocked first thing I asked her have you had enough yet and it took three weeks for her to be able to visit you it took three and then they you have a visit in hall now the prison made the decision that it was not safe for me to have a visit in the visiting home probably right and they so I had a private visit and I had that was when I I sent a letter and so I got my visit my family visited me on the Sunday on the Friday I had my legal visit booked when my q-see and my solicitor Carson Kay would you to see me so this was still at hmpf this is Agent P ho and this is for the appeal because obviously bear in mind I know what's gone on in court I've explained it to my slitters my solicitors then contacted the court for the transcripts from the court the court didn't give them the transcripts they give them half of the transcripts so my solicitors still were in a position where I hadn't met them personally I don't expect him via the video because in the prison you have a video link so you can talk through the camera to your slits are so I spoke to Miss Alyssa I want to be obviously I want to appeal all this I can't believe what's happened so my my finally the date set remind me to sit down was I've been in jail a month but they tied me name and then the reason for them not being able to sit down was the core had not give us all the information so then my god they would come and see me on the Friday my family visiting on the Sunday Monday morning and I'm at what I've been in five prisons before in previous years and how generally was a prison where the prison staff ruled the prison not the prisoners the prison staff and the staff were absolutely because I was isolated from the prison population the prison staff would open my door for two hours a day and I would spend two hours a day interacting with him now burning my concern the whole time was how I spent my sentence in 2012 and the long term in effect that had on me you mean by being in solitary by blinding to the psychological effect a psychological effect which you don't realize at the time I didn't realize at the time so you were in the hospital wing as HMP huh but you were there by yourself yep and I was I was because they could section off the door at the other end to the other prisoners so I was allowed out for two hours a day where I interacted like we're talking now with the prison staff so no other prisoners but prison staff and they were friendly enough absolutely brilliant outstanding actually so difficult VHS to do any exercise for one so every single morning they died model and it be in the hospital it'd be a little room which would have a have a lock a little mini kid so I'd be allowed to use that every morning and then they'd also for an hour and a half a day taking outside we're at sit in a garden where they'd sit and have their break or I'd sit with the prison start again I'd sit and socialize and talk to the Brits and stuff which ideally yada rather just been because so that people understand as well if I had a TV this whole time so that people understand the British prison system when you go to prison every prisoner was given a TV every prisoner okay you have a TV in your cell your cell door would open approximately eight o'clock in the morning you'd get a job you'd go to work you would you would lock about 6 o'clock in the evening so you'd be out yourself you'd be working you've been there acting you you'd have pool tables snooker tables football pitches you play football that's the prison system yeah that's just to keep you in a routine maybe give you some skills and some rage it's a regime everyone has have a prison regime that's your regenerating my rating was very limited whilst I was in the hole but I wasn't complaining okay because I was safe I was still interacting so I'll be all right here yeah but you're the only civil prisoner in Hull I mean I made aware because most list has made them aware that actually you have to let me have a visit each day and actually what comes out so you understand 12 pounds a week now it wasn't a problem at whole because they're taking out my cell I'd go to the canteen and I'd see the prisoners who had serving the food and you pick your food and they give you it so I'd see visually see my food so it was like a cafeteria you take your tray it's a scoop the potatoes and this scoop they say and then you print yourself now so you would eat as much as you felt like and and you would see the food right before your eyes yeah fine yeah I'd see the food so I knew nothing could be done to that food I didn't have that worry and then an a more 12 pound a week actually whilst I was in how it spends twelve pounds on the phone so I could keep in contact with my family so I speak to my wife my children and the reason we're talking about food and interaction with other prisoners and safety and money is because HMP how what you say was passable you were suddenly and without explanation moved is that so as I say my family saw me on the Sunday yeah they went away from the mean happy because I told them I'm fine here and you show your kids for the first time then yeah because because when I say I'm finally prison staff were the ones who locked me previously in a sentence in a room and allowed me to be violently being now in Hull my family my mum wrote a letter every single day to the prison's Minister every single day detailing your what she feared they were doing to me yeah well they were she feared would be allowed to happen to me actually she didn't whilst I was in Hull well it was when I've got two on me but when I saw when I saw him when I saw my family I made them aware I'm fine yeah I'm at and I met I made sure the word went out that I'm okay no we haven't fine here oh I've got six months to serve in prison so there's a 13 month sense but you thought you'd be out in six and a half months serve relatively for look and I'm gonna have my appeal process I'm seeing my QC on Friday Oh at the minute everything no one knew I was in how really like they have us no one saw me in fact no one saw me I was not visible we're not meant to say in the garden no prison prisoners could see the garden I didn't see other prisoners really so it was on the on the unit the hospital unit now Mike you seized you to see me must listen on the Friday and on the Monday the day after my visit they just come in at first thing in the morning and said get your stuff back you're going I think they see where you're going to not even tell me so there was a big secret where they said we're not allowed to say and then all the staff who had been holding me in on the unit were all the surprises me because they were like they were they fought to have you in this prison and to have you safe and to have it calm and to have no problems that's a huge success massive success for the prisoners to see if the Gor what is the rule of law where the guy wasn't safety Nicole wasn't that which was established so everything was caught with obviously no completely you didn't interact with anyone who were just I didn't put in a prison complaint I didn't actually ask people publicly to stay away from the prison to not protest the prison that always been held in in fair condition everything was fine I mean because obviously the prison the prison have her in the position the prison's to govern the rot is as well which he made decision to put me on the hospital wing and that's because he has a duty of care probably a good decision that's what you're saying yeah I'd say yeah yeah I'd say my previous prison sentences where I basically fought my way through them in different prisons yeah he done what he 40 violence against me you shouldn't have been in there in the first place since you weren't a criminal prisoner but given that you were wrongly put in prison that was as good as it was because I can still be a civil prisoner held in Criminal Court in code in prisons but what it means is so you could you can be in there but what means is you're you have more rights okay so because you're no criminal you meet your family on the Sunday in five days you're about to meet your lawyers for the first time so go free to go through our appeal to get basically to get me out but instead the day after you meet your family you told your moved and just so you know so my appointments booked I've been given the appointment slip so the prisoner aware that my q-see in my defense lawyer are coming to see me in the friday it's all booked in i previously spoke to them three times via video in the prison I'm then moved to HMP only and anyone ever explained knew why no still too in fact when I got to only what will go through and when I got to only and I'm asking the head governor of the prison why have you took me here he said it's above my pay grade that's all the answers I got above my pay grade do you believe them I believe that yeah I believe that wouldn't wouldn't have been his decision now it's coming from above them like so I've been moved to only and the prison staff who dropped me there did they took me in a taxi so the prison staff who took me in a taxi so you they pre in taxi Hank off to evil one and they sit and the prison staff that are taking me there I'm saying like look I know only prison only prison is a London so everyone who goes to jail from London we know the demographic of London if only goes to jail from London London has the biggest Muslim population of this country yeah everyone goes to lung it's a prison from London got one of these one of those Katzman prisons so I didn't know the demographic facts at the time but I knew it would be heavily populated with Muslim population yeah so I kept asking again is what's been soit has something been sorted and they said I would had to have been there's no way your governor could have agreed with that governor yeah there wouldn't be for them to decide no they would have had to sort something out and this wouldn't have been for the judge back in Leeds to the side he wouldn't have his essential presence would be a decision made by the prison Authority prison fre and the head of the prisoner 4e which are politicians yeah essentially so basically bear in mind we all know now what fuss has gone on outside of prison in the first three weeks of my prison sentence you're talking with the huge demonstrations a free tom free tommy campaign so this was punishing you or and it looks like at least to punish you because there was grassroots support well looks yeah it looks like it looks like it looks like they weren't happy with the fact that I would have been able to serve a fairly normal prison sentence so I was taken from one of the lowest Muslim population prisons in the UK and I was put in Agent P only only has the highest Muslim population of any seek a prison in in the UK ok so you arrived by taxi now you told us that at how old you were in the hospital wing no one even saw you your only interactions for with the staff your cell door was open a few hours a day exercise garden phone calls tell me what it was like going from Hull to online so I'm booked I'll get to reception upon me where you you assess where you ever talk I ask them a guess you know who I am they said yes we do that's okay so what's been saw it has anything been sorted where am i where am I going in this prison and he goes Oh you're going on to the induction wing I'm so lucky like or surprised I said okay and then they send the governor coming this was the number one gun that's that's what we would call a warden you know America the person in charge yeah person in charge come in I made him aware of my concerns that what I thought the prison system we're doing and and tell me what those concerns for our welcomes rather I think they've intentionally taken me from a place of safety and they're now gonna have me killed and what did he say he said you under the name you actually gonna not tell me what my soon you'll be fine oh my god that's actually what DeMuth like no one will know who I am oh my god no did he say with a straight face what was a straight face and and but then it's like then he said obviously you're aware and I said I know the size of the Muslim population is prison and he kept say saying like his robot programmed spiel of we are a prison with a large diverse population no no no you're a prison with a large Muslim population and population and see if the person okay if the prison was a 100 percent black can you put me in there yeah my problem is that you have a large Muslim population and statistics and facts show some percentage of those people outside a prison if we look outside the prison thirty percent of British Muslims believe someone violence is acceptable to someone who's inside with the Prophet Mohammed they've sent you guy in the prison system the violent radicalization prison system with violent offenders that's going to voice so so I'm in a bit so I said so there any signal what you need to do is you need to self isolate yeah so I've either said well I'm not gonna self Eisley now what he wants me to do is winningly isolate myself so when they put me on the wing willingly keep my door locked and refute and say that I want to self isolate I willingly want to be isolated I'm not going to do that because I know what six months of the nice lady's going to do to me yeah I'd rather and then he said his comments are you'll be endangered though if you go out of yourself because I said I'm not gonna sell firstly they said you'll be in danger I said I'm in danger every time I walk out my front door still walk out of it now I'm going to you put so I'm going to walk straight out of that all and whatever I'm gonna I'm going to defend myself in any situation at which place of all I'm gonna put you down the block then I said goodnight and I asked again what risk assessment did you do before you bought me from the lowest Muslim population prison to the highest and why have you done this then I'm taken straight down to the block where again so people aware I didn't ask for a solution I'm not asked to be segregated I was happy to them to open my door okay not happy in the sense that I probably would have been killed in fact every member of the staff or the president told me from that point on you'd have got murdered man like if you'd have been out there you'd have been killed so all of this because of it so I have a hundred prisoners on the wing over they average insane or Muslim let me ask you just for a second about Muslim gangs in prison yes many of the people who go into prison convert to become Muslim for protection as a defense I said these 30% statistics I've sent them on these Muslim must not include anyone that's conveyed while they're in there I spoke to a prisoner who was down the block who had been beaten beaten so bad boiling water over him for two hours beaten by Muslims in the prison because he was having bacon because he had bacon on his life so where was the prison staff during this turning a blind eye on the many prisons as I said hos a prison that was run by the staff only in fact government a government investigation internally not more this is not me saying it anyone can go read this government report said it's violently unsafe it's dangerous when we look at the radicalization within prisons we know that Muslim Muslim gangs have taken over prisons okay this is not me saying again these are government it sounds like they enforce halal pretty well that's pretty you're doing bacon by many prisoners to prevent this have just took pork completely off the menus most prisons now you just don't get pork not Apple so it only still has pork as an option yeah but obviously a lot people you've got the free brave to order it is there is there a rival gang to the Muslim gonna know that because the Muslim gang is so large anyone who converts to Islam this way in the British prison system so make sex offenders and things I just convert because no one will give them violent violent attacks or hassle because they're part of the Muslim Brotherhood so if you're for a Muslim you say what you see English that's my English that's all convert with the most weak and vulnerable people in our society who have usually been wronged their whole life when you sit down and speak to most people in prison if you if you've understood outside of prison get a prisoner coming out and ask them their life story you'll see that they've been wronged they've been wronged in growing up they've been wronged by the system whether they have been abused mentally or physically sexually and then you have these people who have got so much anger anyway at society being let down many many of them when you hear when you actually hear cuz I've got done it you saw Michael two prisoners speak to people and see the opportunities they had were pretty low and then you then have an ideology that will take the hangar and direct it and you'll become part these people haven't had a community haven't had it belonging haven't had a path Islam gives them all of that and very dangerously and and that's why and most of these people aren't converting I've had these arguments with many of them within the prison system they're converting to a gang not converting to a religion it's amazing that the governor of that prison is such a fool think that that you wouldn't be recognized basically we're not go through this he'd meet self isolate or they wanted you to get killed kilter else transpired was that which I'll put this complaint in to the prison was that the Imam where so basically I got taken to the block of the prison the block is a punishment area of a prison it's where I spent five months in 2012 in different prisons now the block is usually in the basement of a jail usually okay underneath the prison let me so be there why what are the other options you mentioned there's a hospital wing in Hull now there's nothing in only so it's what is there besides a block nothing just normal wings guys so normal prison normal prison wings where you come out you said I in the morning again where you have a TV so you were instead of the normal prison wing you were put in the block which is a heavier I was taking straight to the block way anyone who if you stab someone in prison or you attack someone or you've robbed someone or you're violence or staff you then get taken from your normal prison location and you put in the block so that's not even regular criminals those are criminals who then we offend in prison prison so you're not even supposed to be treated like a criminal prisoner in the first place and now you're being treated as a criminal who is offended again well you'll see it this time so we're not so bearing in mind again the thing that was one was cross-trainers I'd come from home where I was fine and Here I am now and I'm taken down to the block of the prison and as I'm walked into the block the other prisoners who because prison I think happens down there you locked up all day as soon as the noise comes people looking through the gaps in their doors or the gaps in their way where their window to see who's being brought down what's happened yet so I'm born and instantly instantly erupts with there was I made the prison were aware of this anyway so I'm then put in my prison cell with a blue mat and again I'll say okay so you're putting you're making the decision not me you're making the decision that you'll put me down the block because you're saying I'm not safe now what's the symbolism of the bloom out what do you mean by that so you don't have a bed in prison so you have a bed anyway normal bit you're in prison yeah you have like a prison mattress but in in wait and yeah you also have a TV and you also have a wardrobe and you also have a table you must have a chair you have all these things yeah now down the block you have nothing you just have a blue mat because the paper will be down there it's basically a smash proof room it doesn't have a normal toilet it doesn't have any it has nothing thing you can smash that you can't break anything so just a blue mat and this is anyway your first night in in onli you're being put into the block in a place where a violent murderer who killed someone else in prison in the yard this is this is the worst place this is the punishment this is the park but then even even the prisoners that do that they study allowed spend 14 to 28 days maximum down there and how long were you down there so no in this case I'd a week yeah so when I went in there I went in and then one prisoner in the cell next door to me spent the entire night smashed in and boot in my my wall through you like he was going to come into my cell I reminded him that he's in prison and the prison walls probably don't to deal with that and then so I spend the first night down there the frets that instan there was a prisoner called carnage straightaway there's a price up for me to get me sir they were all shouting and amongst each other I'm then taking the next day I get 30 minutes exercise so that people understand you have prison windows here prison windows here here's the entrance so I'm taking out my cell and for 30 minutes I'm putting this cage I'm putting a cage with foaminess well walk around the cage on my own we've all the other prisoners who are in the block looking at the cage so hang on so this is not in that gym or a yard they've just made a little there's a durable trap for you there's a cage yeah there's a cage which is where where you walk around when you're down the block so it's just so this is not a normal exercise facility and no no and you're on display for all the other prisoners is that right you're on display for the other prisoners who down the block so this is inside the prison yep it's basically read by this ring by big huge fences it's like a it's like the Thunderdome in Mad Max you're in the center of it and you just watch so you and bearing in mind all of the shower and all of the abuse all the frets which look I'm used to yeah I'm used to this sure they can't be used to a hundred men screaming they're gonna murder you know is that what let me not assume what were they saying so so you're it took them a few days to get my family's names so people they knew you right away oh that's fool governor oh you're Stephen the absolutely so the next day I was sat before the governor yeah and I said to him your staff will tell you how this place erupted last night when I come in your hole prisons eruptive now because I'm in it and they're all gonna kill me you would think he would want to get you out of that prison he said he said I don't think you cuz I said he's your intention because one point I kept making yeah it was about TV now the World Cup was on started England were playing I'm my rights as a civil prisoner should be a lot more visits money etc instead I'm being held in this condition where I've got no TV I've got nothing for 30 minutes a day or I'm per hour and paraded around all of the other Muslim prisoners are in there so 30 minutes isn't even a relief it's in a 30 minutes of abuse on that first day which again ourself send you this form I reacted and I say you Islam as a cancer arrested for it hang on a second you got a you got arrested yeah for saying for criticizing the religion of Islam I said as long as I can well actually said Islam is a cancer and I am the I am the cure but I said I've waited is that a crime what were you arrested for I was arrested for religious and racial agent no I want again I've got this arrest but let me stop you there yes you said the very first night you're in there your neighbors trying out your majesty a guy named Khan is saying there's a price on your head were they arrested no no listen when you go into the cage and for a half hour being screamed out tell me some of the things they said to you everything you can think oh I want to hear it just that I'll be killed I'll be murdered my family will be murdered just comments about my wife comments about my family but my daughter's any arrests no no it's no where they locked down where they shut down there when I got before the governor the next morning so when I'm when I was called in to see the governor I said one man spent six hours the whole night last night smart and again what my my my stress with it was that was fine in whole you've now purposely taken me to a prison where they they they can then use the threat against me to put me on solitary confinement and surrounded by people who want to do me harm so so your comment about is them being in cancer not the most polite thing to say but I would imagine it's a gentle reaction compared to the death threat me calmly actually wait wait wait but and so that's what it was there was a reaction of them screaming at you it was a reaction to just so who who who called the guard on you was it a prison a prison gonna hurt so basically I get this which which you can conclude this rest form on the video I'll give you the best one he says at this hours and it gives the hours I heard Jack C Lennon's shout Islam is a cancer and I am The Cure so the governor himself heard that one not one of the prison staff the woman governor so the prison staff heard everything before that and was fine with that this really is the which was the points are casein now if I want to face further arrests I just have to remain silent well so all of this is going on every day what happened after you I mean you're in prison already were they gonna do have a they give you extra days and things like so I asked I asked to cut enough so why not when I went before the governor I don't want to speak to us list out about this yeah and I asked the governor are there blasphemy laws in this prison no and what's going on with all the threats against me how come no one those people being disciplined and then I never heard another word after this did he do the answer those questions no he said you've asked for useless are this will now be adjourned it's not cool yeah they adjourned it I didn't spend a week where after the first day it was a Muslim who was bringing me my food so this is where it changes yeah you talked about in in how you would go cafeteria and you'd say give me some of that and give me some of that and you could see the food was the same all the other prisoners head and they tell me what it was like it on my cell so my food rupee bought to me on a on a tray with my name on top of it they tore food and it would be prepared by Muslim prisoners that a prisoner from the normal location would come down to the block to do the food it was a Muslim within a day so how's your dinner Tommy how was your dinner the shouts coming from the other prisoners the shouts why would they say that because they because I know I know especially in this prison as well anything can get smuggled in most prisoners have mobile phones yeah weapons I saw from my window crack another prisoner being beaten with a bar not this beak yes why is it so they said it sounds like a chaotic wild place it doesn't sound like it's governed at all it's no governed the prisoners government so the jungle so I know that now that I'm in this prison system now that now that I mean only and my foods been brought to my cell with my name one and comments are being made already laughing about how was your dinner Tommy did you enjoy it laughing so sorry I didn't I sense I'm not Ian yeah what do you what do you think could be in it well if I was in there you can get anything smuggled into prison anything you want poison well you can yeah you can't rat poison easily something a bit now I'm not gonna sit and keel over in my cell and give a victory away like that to people who despise me and want to kill me for when I win again I should have 50 pound a week spend only got 12 and so is that your own money or money no my your money yet money that people send in so so so when you say you you should be allowed 50 pounds a week to spend you're only allowed 12 that's even your own money and that would be to buy things from the prison from the prison wrapping us up in this so I bought again that I've said I've got the receipts of what I bought each time I bought five tins of tuna and I love you card to send to my wife two packs of space Raiders and five-pound phone credit so how much - no you see five tens or two nights that per week yeah it feels real like 110 a day want anything now that that's not a lot of energy that's not a lot of vitamins did did you have anything else water for everyone fruit very more so for the first week I didn't eat a single thing and the prison were aware I didn't eat your single thing because I because I had no tuna because you to get your forms you have to get your forms to get your canteen you're weak so I filled out a form when I got there and then a week later my team as a tuner would come so for the first week I a not a single thing did you have water cut up warrior did you have any fruit and because you can black fruit on your canteen as well and then you get fruit as so you basically you fill out your week's food and then you get it the next week so if you even the meals did the prison say anything if you were on a hunger strike or if you were your health was in jeopardy I mean not eating for a day or so but not evening for a week they took me after after one week so I want my guy Ivan Ian the reason I mean because economy anyway so they've took me to see the governor and the everyday I was putting complaint saying I believe which people have read and they've been mocked I believe I'm being mentally tortured and the reason I'm saying that is because I know I should not be behind the door 23 hours a day I know I should be getting a visit every day I know I should have 50 pounds spend I know I should be able to eat and I know I should not have been moved from the safe but they again journalists should be asking the question people should be asking the prison system should have to answer the government should have to answer why was I moved from no problems and no risk into the biggest Muslim population of the country why was I then put into a position where I was paraded for 30 minutes a day amongst them why was why would I be I spend non-stop threats now what after one week I had no TV so obviously I'm just sitting in a cell listen to all this I can't I can't comment because I've been arrested in the first week for coming in so I put in these complaints saying that this is this is and and again you have to understand that my main concern here is I know I've got six and a half months to do and I know what I was like our last time so I know if they can hold me in this room like this for the next six months I'm not going to come out in a good place no and I was I was really worried about that because interacting with my kids and family and everything was affected when I spend the last solitary confinement so all of these things were worrying to me I also knew that my appeal date obviously missed my obviously they'd moved me so I hadn't had my meeting with my lawyer so so how long was it before you even met your lawyer so then it wasn't so once they got me into Haiti on H&B only my lawyers were trying to make an appointment it was at least another week no it's not so they're Primo's maybe Friday so there's another week before I got to see money where that's a month you know that least a month at least now I understood because I was there your Court of Appeal hearing your lawyers said that when they tried to meet you the meetings were either canceled or or shrunk to less than an hour's that's true so they struggled to get their day they would get trying to get the me in which they weren't being responded to and then they finally got the meeting now when they had the meeting there was a two-hour meeting to see my lawyer this is the first chance I've got to go free now that's a great Freda case yeah and I'm sitting there my meetings been to start at two o'clock my legal meeting my lawyers got to court got to the prison at one o'clock so they got there an hour early this men started two o'clock I got bought in a corp a spree and this is all this is you had my q-see in court Mike you see he's never experienced this was going on so what excuse was given then I have to give an excuse the same way when my so wit my when I was held for those first seven days without a TV in solid band the block my lawyers putting a little saying just to give you prior notice where we're putting in for a judicial review we're going to take you to call they have 28 days to respond 20 less so they don't have to even reply for 28 days so and the TV thing I saw the mainstream media was mocking that it's not because you want to watch sports necessarily it's because you're in a if you're in a room with sensory deprivation is that the reason you need a TV that's my guess was the world cup was on yeah so you do like the sport I love I usually been at the World Cup my also other reason was had just been I'd had a TV for the first number of weeks in Hull my main reason is that look lock yourself in a room with nothing cool yeah nothing cool nothing yeah where you only come out of that room to walk Cajun for 30 minutes a day do that for a week yeah right Danko's like a week you have no interaction or knowledge of what's going on really in the world you you do not speaking to anyone you've got no one to talk to you so you would drive you mad so yeah so so I know that six months of this so in my in my complaints I'm saying look give me a TV at least give me and and and here's oh and 750 prisoners are in hot only prison and everyone out for one of them has got a TV including the murderers yeah this will down the block when you're down the block for punishment for 14 days dive TV so what I kept saying is you're punishing me now which you are because you can't keep me safe now I didn't bring myself to only you brought me here you must have done a risk assessment before you brought me here you must have so and then I so you know have you ever been given access to your prison files no we're trying to get now we still waiting we're trying to get my blood samples to show how am i oh no so let me ask you about that so you didn't need a bike for a week I didn't even Bob my for a week and then that and then the prison governor the number one gotten asked to see me and when I saw him he asked if we move yourself yeah so from the block so a normal cell now in a normal cell they're just better cells they're bigger you have a window that opens this much instead of normal yeah in the block you don't your window doesn't open yeah so you have a window that opens this much and you have a bigger cell you have a more comfortable bit you have a desk things like that so if we move you onto the wing the normal wing will you II yeah and then he said you need to sign this disclaimer and he gave me a disclaimer which said I would be self wesleyan so I didn't against it so it's sterling you for food you're seven days starving he says I'll give you food if you sign away that said then I said I've told you already I'm not self i sling yeah he they said well you'll stay down here I says well I'll stay down here then I'll stay down here then but obviously you're aware until I get my canteen economy anyway yeah at which point then he changed the disclaimer and he rewrote it where it basically said we will move to another cell but you will not be an able to integrate with any other prisoners due to the stability of the prison you will not be allowed to work now when we this is where it gets quite key well we're on about 12 pound a week where I can spend to have enough to eat if you can work in prison like everyone works cause everyone gets a job you can spend another twelve pound a week right and then you can get enhanced where you have good behavior and the prisoners see you behave well you then become enhance where you can spend another twelve and a week so but barely more I'm a civil prisoner undisputable no one can say I'm not civil because the crime is civil oh I should have fixed panel week or I should be able to buy food I wasn't I was then once I was moved to the block one time I was moved from the block people were saying or he wasn't on solitary confinement I was then moved to another cell where I was not allowed that cell once yeah that the condition that I had to sign if I wanted to be moved was that they were forcefully isolating me which I wanted it to say because I wanted it I slay myself and that was key point for me not isolate myself you put me on that wing I'm coming out and whatever happens happens and if I get killed I get killed because if you're doing that and I'm not gonna it's my own like part of my own I said I'd see anything else was being kept being account yeah and but I know I'm gonna get killed at the same time so I'm not gonna ask for separation and I'm put me there damn thing I was think and in the form that I had to sign to get moved from the block it said which again this is public he said that the only time I'll be allowed on my cell is when the rest of the prison is locked for lunch so between half one and a half two I'll be taken from my cell escorted down to the block back to the block back to the block where I have a shower and I walk around the cage iam now lit these in their own these are only little things yeah but little things my boy from what my wife said work on my children at school between half one and a half two so essentially I can't speak too much of kids now now what what's frustrating is all around the prison all you ever hear seem about his mental health a and keeping prisoners in contact with their family which is super important if you don them to reoffending z and things they try to do so there's like posters posters we were saying exposures how much if cyst campaigns yes psychologist yeah whole campaign did you see any psychologist I got in there was mental health were there with the governor where I expressed to them did they say a word no I said to them everything I think you're doing and the reason I think you're doing it what I kept asking why have you taken me here you're going to now hold me on solitary for six months all know what you're doing yeah they then told me you won't be here in a week specifically said you will not be here in a week who said that the governor he said you will not be an army for I mean only in a week's time so then I think I can get moved I've never got moved did these so-called mental health advisors they come and saw me the day before when I and what do they say there I told them again I need to be al more so so complaints after complaint self committee one the complaints are said is that for an hour day just let me on the field yeah let me run around the field and again I felt like everything was dangling the carrot because then they reply to the complain which I've got saying we are going to do that basically yeah they didn't do it they never know since and not once did I come out myself that once I got put onto the wing into the wing location this was obviously again my cell location which i think is quite important anyone can check this I was in cell hate swing which is induction wing so nine I can show you an overhead to view of them prison because I've done it on Google Maps to show and then directly opposite my window what's the industrial Union which I've said was a mosque used as a mosque he's used as a mosque on a Friday and what's gonna Sunday to church now every so every prisoner in that prison who's Muslim will walk past my window to go in there to break ya know this is when you're in a block or when you're in the way got moves on to the wing now the thing that they made me signs clearly stated that if there were problems when I'm on the wing they would reassess my security situation and basically put me back down the block yeah we're in the block there's no electricity so the reason they're saying we're not giving your TV there is lecturers there is a TV point they're saying the electricity's not working down there yeah for TV that's what they told me so yep put that down the block so upon the wing I'd Muslims prisoners mid Muslims at my cell door constantly some of them there wasn't that from Brixton lovely that wasn't in fact was saying to the others just leave him alone yeah but your time it was just frets after frets off the phrase and my window did anyone start them ever from coming to your door to issue that never know one of them was moved so one of him in the cell opposite me was moved now this was a prisoner who come to my cell and told me they had a message for me from saiful islam and who's safe for islam means sword of Islam that's his name he's in jail for what Isis terrorism he's the leader of a terrorist group in Bern called Alma's routine he was the second in command of that group he's from my hometown of Lewin he's physically had run-ins with me in my hometown of Lewin he's like the leader of the radical Muslims in Britain and he was passing a message on to me things that were going to happen to my family yeah now I can you say any of them here really put your family at risk to say he knew things he knew things about my family like location or names or ages names names of my children of my family and I then so the prisons and he told me he come from speaking from saiful islam now we're not saw the female members staff there was a one member sarahfey mom himself i sit oh look i'm a big concern now yeah this is normal this isn't because I was getting spat through my window shit come through my window in the end what I did on my window was I just shut my windows yeah after the first couple of days okay so when you say spat and and human excrement yeah that's because you were on the outside my cell with my cell my beds here my bets here and the windows here the bed isn't you can't move you bit its dust ways and the windows here now both the windows I'd down open this much yeah but you know that boiling the point in summer we had in Britain I had my windows open and then within a few days it was clear that I couldn't have my windows open because of the shit and spear and just people at my window now did you have to be on the ground floor across from the hose I could have been on any floor did you did you bring this to the attention of staff no I didn't know I did the soft were very aware of the fritz and the things come another window but I didn't ask for a move because I didn't put down the block my thing if there's issues with you on the wing you'll be put said it clearly which again people can read now it was anyone ever charged for throwing things through your window in the morning the prison officer went and checked and he had just come from a maximum security prison where this prisoner where saiful islam was being held so it was a credible message it was legit oh yeah and what happened to him they moved him they moved to me so that's did they move down the block no no no so so you can be a messenger with a death threat my family from a terrorist and your punishment is you move to another cell with a TV and then a no just complaining buddy you're down in the block yeah so when I said so I mean I'm completely isolation anyway yeah I'm taking out for phonons today run walk down I wrote my wife for that in this in the first week I was in Agent P on me and it was an it wasn't public it was a letter for me to detail detail a lot of things on it I needed to say to her because because the be honest in that first week I generally in that first week I didn't think I'd make out and in fact I thought I know what their intentions are now I know what's gone on them were previous in their sentences so I wrote a letter basically apologizing to my wife and it was me apologizing not for anything I've done but for the situation that she finds herself in that we find us her and then I know also and that really was to explain it it was important for me saying if I got killed in that prison sinners there was a lot of things but I hadn't said unneeded say especially with regards to just move regards to my wife and and then to my children so I wrote three individual letters to my children where I wanted to say to them the thing that was killing me most was if they say I've got killed and they thought about that then they'd be angry at me for thinking no I didn't care about them I didn't care about their mister why are we done why I do what I do and so individually in the I broke my heart to avoid it and then they didn't send it they held back the now why did they do that how do you know that cuz they couldn't give me a form and they and they give me a form saying let's not be the same because they think it's gonna end up online what difference does that make it's your letter they think it's gonna end up on the earth oh yeah that makes seem like a little thing it looks like a last will and testament Ted can you would you can you tell me what you said to your wife it took person that's my wife or his apologies look there's been times over the last years where I haven't been livable wife well I've been living at my mom's and things like where I've made mistakes even across my marriage and yeah it was just and then there was apologies about about because she everything that goes on with me you all may be serving a prison sentence she's serving her sentence only oh and then and then also is there I wrote was prior to the police gun see my wife thought it was then just just things to tell my children about about their characters yeah did it did you tell these things to your wife after you got out did you say them to her yeah yeah it's not an even with my kids it would be that he tried to tell your wife or you're trying to tell your wife which I've tried to say how many times oh this isn't about my kids yeah this isn't about our kids this battle is about every single child and the next generation of children across this country even the people who hate me even the people who despise me even the politicians it's about their kids and their kids and and it's about everyone's kids so this goes beyond the lead of my children the needs of my children you know I should shut my mouth and just be a dad but it's far bigger than that and wise book and and it essentially it's like if we remain silent if we ignore and we we don't stand up so the blatant rules that we can see to the blatant dangers we see our country and then our families in an arc and our communities in if we don't then essentially if there's gonna be a battle and someone's gonna have to put themself up then let be me not my son so I could and tried to explain that to your wife it was not politically minded or it doesn't really all she cares about is being a mother to the kids and I kid she doesn't think deeply about she doesn't view the country she doesn't I mean it's like a truck so it was to put it it was a 10-page of me not just breaking my heart and I actually said in there this isn't a suicide note I know it reads like it because I genuinely at that time I'm thinking why if they moved me to this prison they're gonna let them have a shot yeah I found out at the Imam where the prisoner who who works down the block when I spoke to him he said when I was turned out in the exercise yard he said I knew three days before you go he was coming in I said how'd you know that he said the in mom was telling everyone so they don't think him so the Muslims of in the prison have had an opportunity to prepare themselves when I previously got violently beaten in prison I was locked in a room I knew that those members living lads didn't know I was gonna be locked in that room yeah because I could tell by their faces now if you give someone opportunity then they're getting lice and they're getting blades they're gonna be ready for me when they get that one opportunity to touch to have a swipe at me they're gonna get it so I'm waiting all that up and I'm thinking that of why I've been moved from one prison to another so I'm generally I don't think I'm coming out of it and there's a lot there's a lot I wanted to say or I want to say not just to my wife but to my children and then when they stop there there is a reason they would end up online just echo what was my previous and then my lawyers have contacted the prison in saying give us a copy of the layer which said they didn't again and then and then so then yeah so when you were in HMP how when you were in the hospital wing in this safer prison you did write a letter what did you and I know it got through because I start posted online I'm very pretty yes from hm behold as well a brief flower but it wasn't there because I thought I looked around for I'm alright yeah yeah so when I was it only in that first week I fought I'm not worried so they didn't stop your letter at how no the one that was on line and was incredibly touching I want to remind you of something you said I mean you had a lot of sense of humor in that letter you talked about how Donald Trump jr. mentioned your case and you joked that was worth the whole thing but he also wrote about your son and I've had the pleasure of meeting him he's just like you Tom yeah and how he couldn't understand what was going on and how he wanted to go to to do something bad so he could be put in prison to be with his dad and I heard from your wife that he slept with an old shirt of yours that hadn't been laundered just so he could smell his dad until this the scent was gone after weeks what did you say to your kids and the letters so the the letters were just to talk about them just to talk about it's also open one then I've sort of trot as children taps and they under yeah just for them to understand know everything I do I do it cuz yeah do they understand what you're doing do they know about these subjects of you kept them shielded from these okay I've kept shielded from knowing knowing the severity of the risks of the phrase for example when I was in when I was in modernly free my door opens and again this is my door opens up about 9 o'clock at night where's your wife how am I meant them nowhere more what Barry the only time when us do that three members of prison staff know but only mind the only time I'm allowed out my cell they've specifically made it so it's not when I can bring my wife and children so where's my wife and I said I don't know they said the police are trying to find your wife that's okay and I said why then they said there's Intel that she's going to be at active asset no and then they shot my dad well basically that's basically it and there's the Genoa she's and then they shot my door so then to say I wish I didn't I didn't sleep a wink man and I'm waiting and wait and then the solid genuine question that's a taunt yeah the sickening thing is is like so basically my wife get the police knock on my web store and they give a little leaflet of what to do when you attack the asset oh my you've got see the leaflets also effective which police force mentorship please and then two days later three days later they go to my mum's and they do exactly the same work to do when you're attacked with acid oh it's called the police on the list at all oh no one of the things is done you cannot get weapons you cannot have a weapon to defend yourself so basically you cannot break the law one of the things I'd lines is do not break the law so so and then basically I'm sat in prison thinking my boys going to get attacked all my mom's gonna get attack because I went to my mum's two days later and then I have the mental pool of is this even real because or is this to mess with me is this to psychologically destroy me whilst holding me on solitary confinement whilst probably in these positions and then the fuck so the first thing the opportunity or I then get to use the phone when I do get hold of my family you can imagine my wife situation of how she's feeling you could imagine their stress and what and worried about all of that and it's just like and then in the whole time I'm I'm reminding myself that I mean I'm in e4 standing outside a courtroom and and telling people the names of men again I can't comment yet legally on what happened to their trial but of men who are alleged to a rape not to a hundred young children and and I'm a civil prisoner and I shouldn't be in it I shouldn't be held in these conditions I'm naughty I can t I then put in forms or put a complaint say look if you make me enhanced yeah I get an extra 12 pound a week then I'll combine more food yeah joke they replied I've got the copy at their response they replied saying we have to your good behavior oh my good so make you to make you enhanced but because you'll know yourself we can't see you bathing well and it's like are you for real you know I know there's a phenomenon here in the UK called caged prisoners it's all these former al-qaeda prisoners from Guantanamo cured up to defendant this is the other thing that was so desire for me I know what's going on I know it's a kangaroo court I know I've been illegally imprisoned I know everything that has gone wrong I now know that my rights are being trampled over my human rights might might we talk about contempt of court I mean I'm ago I'm a supposedly in prison for contempt accor we're sitting outside Westminster it's them who have the show guilty of contempt they can't waive contempt for civil rights can we contend for justice can we have contempt for free speech give me a contempt for democracy and the most recent things and I'm sitting in prison know it all of this is happening now in all of that every single day the frets the frets the frets the the constant which isn't a situation it had to be all they had to do which my solicitors wrote to them as soon as they moved me at the time we must list as rosid moving back to hole he was fine John they said which I've got again in Brighton is that for them to move me to a prison that matches my racial prejudice or prejudice yeah would be immoral and illegal all right so so to put me in a prison which has the most remove and bear in mind that when I put my complaint in one of my complaint said that seven percent of the whole was a Muslim focusing of only is I feel like you've personally endanged me they response was if you speak negatively about our Muslim population again yeah you'll be on the IEP system which is again a rest yeah now they're the ones how to be only and their staff and their governor are the ones that said I wasn't safe not me yeah they're the ones that put me down the block and helped me on soldier confinement because they said that I'd be violently attacked not me I didn't it's not it's not what I've done I didn't isolate myself they then held me for months probation come to see me so week before my appeal a week before I had my peer appeal I had a probation officer who had been to see my wife and assess my home for my release from prison and then they come to see me where they informed me that one of my conditions because my htc which is where you're released on tag my tag date was coming up in September tag is where you can tag it here in tax where you have a electronic tag around your ankle and you go home and so basically if you get five month prison sentence after three and a half months I'd be at home where for another three months I'd spend where I have been my house between seven and seven so seven o'clock at night and several other morning you have to be at home so probation this is the participation service so they come to see me because they were assisting my property they went to meet with my wife for my family and then about me being released on tag they then told me that my condition this is where it becomes very apparent what all of this is about my condition upon release will be I will be banned from in banned from using there till June 2019 how what does that have to do with they you tell me you know you're my previous present sentence when I was leading English Defence League my condition which was for legally and in America my condition then was not to contact the EDL so anyone anyone who wants to sit and say that this case this current case is not politically motivated that means that they'd have to accept they'd have to accept for it not to be politically motivated there to have to accept the judge by accident incorrectly a judge of 30 years or ever top judge would not realize they has to ask me if I'm guilty or not get we would not have to tell me what I've done mom would not have to let me speak to my solicitor with it so then they'd have to buy into that they didn't have to buy into the fact that the prison accidentally hold me as a criminal prisoner not a civil prisoner they then have to buy into the fact that just by accident I was moved from the safety of whole into HMP only and put under all of these conditions they then have to see that it's normal for someone to be banned from the Internet yes they would put you out of business and it would shut you up by a hundred other messages well respect you unrelated to this court case which is what all of this is about who would have drafted that that tag condition who would use of probation services or not run by the government so just the internet completely that's what this is about this isn't about you standing outside of a court case this is about you having any opinions on any matter whatsoever it's about them silence in a stop him which is something they've had a tactic to do and try to do for multiple years now if I sit here now and Sebelius says well I come at a chow clearly I've lost a lot of weight I first put nearly a stone back on why I asked you you told me when you win anyway that I'm gonna just say it in pound yeah 190 pounds and you came out just over a hundred and fifty pounds what's that in stone how do you say it here's three so that's not healthy to lose that much weight through starvation of course not it's not healthy and I also know the worry my head the whole time I'm in there is I know what I went through 2012 when I come out of prison we shall never spoke publicly about cuz again it's quite embarrassing even even now I'm not ever compare it to anything anyone's been through a war it's nothing like it yeah it's nothing like it but it is purposely done everything that's happened with your sentence the isolation the purposely put me in a position where they can say because of his safety we need to boomer in solitary because of that the threats to my wife the police visits all of these things that I'll say a purposely done I knew that I'm a lot better now even now when I come out prison almost ran whole life to each other which meant I didn't have to communicate really talk I just lay by the pool and I spoke to people a couple of people that were families on the holiday when I come back from on lay my kids on it and this is the Joe the most different that most thing angers me frustrates me is that if you post on confront at me I'll for you put saying they're not for you and that's what I've done for 10 years whenever they've knocked me down I've got back up and carried on for you and then what they've managed to do I come out of jail I've gone away on my family on I know the time my wife yeah when I'm sorry the night you got out of prison you looked you look shaken I will shaken my speech you want yourself hear yourself no and even now no no I'm not myself eeeh I went to come out of better watch I went to watch you leave and play football and I took my kids because I was I knew even when I was in prison I know I have to gather so well visit that family come to visit me by the end in nature beyond ly I didn't want us him now that's fuck that's messed up yeah yeah barflies for five hours before going to see my own family yeah what an immune you don't want to come out yourself so when I was first I'm complaining then I'll come in get me in the tube get me this give me this by the end of it yeah and so we know all these things every single day every opportunity I don't know thirty minute there was four times in one week where they didn't even get me out for the three minutes every Tuesday I wasn't allowed out at all for 24 hours okay because there was a judge doing the Judah patient's and they were too busy down the block every two but so I know I need to get out so why not come over Mon therefore I need to get back into the system I want to get back out there I went to a Luton Town football match I left at halftime yeah well I won't just because we were losing it's because and I was post up my friends come out to watch the box in which I cancelled and it's because I won't know I'm not right and and general you know how I've seen it can be when I think that they've got away with doing it losing that kind of weight not on purpose but because you're being starved that's a medical that's a medical extreme condition did any doctors prescribe you supplements vitamins did they take tests did you have you examined I had a blood test I told every member of that staff how concerned I was about more BIOS and they must have see I was shocked when I saw you when you got out I couldn't believe they had to do all they had to do was make me an arm so I had another ten pound another ten pound would have been another six or seven teams to tuna a week and and what do they care to your own money but did a dog did a doctor ever seen so took my blood test so what I sense is that when I went to court so basically barely more it took them a couple of hours to send me to prison I've then gone before it took me two months before I can get back into a court see judge now when I went before the court the High Court the judge heard everything yeah so he knew how wrong it was they still kept me in prison for another two weeks of soldier confinement I did he could have released me should've released me on bail there and then so when when did the the doctor take your blood so when I come back after that court case so because I think in court even made public about my health about my worry about what concerns my solicitors concerns then they and then so day before my a day before my verdict a day before my verdict the mental health team come to see me they took me from me and mental health team well said to him like I can't do another phone ups this yeah I was only when's your story was told in public court did a doctor that they would have seen you wasting away but it was only when the public court he come and took come it took blood sample did he ask you any questions would he just take blood did he ask you know they asked me questions every time I spoke to him I told him you need to come out itself did they did he give you any diagnosis did he give you any prescriptions did he say give this man more food did you ever see that doctor again are you sure was a real doctor no sorry I don't know someone on their rounds if somebody works in the prison in the healthcare have you ever regard the results of that blood test no this has been trying to get it now did you ever go to a doctor once you got out of prison yeah I did of the interesting to see you but you put 10 pounds back on I put 10 pounds back on I've been so I've been to see dr. Muslim doctor lovely firm he did see he's he died he's diagnosed me again it's an embarrassing thing because I'm not a city look and say Joe it's actually missing persons humiliation was done to you it warms me up because they've been allowed to do it and and it didn't have to be this way no I want to justify no one can answer a question to the media all of this can happen all of this can happen with the full support of the every single politician in that building you know and every single media outlet not one not one media when your letters begging for food begging for some social interaction asking for just a simple TV when those letters were obtained by the Daily Mail instead of writing about your abuse they mocked your handwriting style they said that it was a handwriting of someone who's insecure well you were you you you you were people who have friended me every minute of every day my wife was under threat my mother was under threat I'm held I knew I knew in conditions I'd know it it's 2008 you would not hold you you would not be allowed to put in the position they put me treat the way they treated me without the RSPCA coming into it setback you shouted a dog yeah yeah just not a dog you give a dog no exercise you put a dog in a box in that heat you're exactly right see any human rights law yes everyone everyone fell over each other and pushed each other either way to give hit piece after hit piece to BBC channel 4 square news they don't done big hit pieces and while I deserve to be in prison yeah but I remember they had a human rights lawyer on explaining why you ought to be in prison here's the thing even after the court of appeal quashed the original sentence and just devastated it in five ways they they didn't just see on the you C now I was worried when I was in prison I didn't believe most listeners telling me they've gotta let you out yeah and I'm saying they're not gonna let me out why I know they're not gonna let me out so briefly in 2014 my mortgage for trial when I got myself together recently I spent 16,000 pounds with a QC to go through my mortgage for trial now what they found just like this case yeah was that it was all unlawful okay now what we went the Court of Appeal with the same Court of Appeal let me free six months prior we went to the Court of Appeal where they heard the case where it was put to the core now the core appeal judge and the prosecution all three my oath all of them read the law and said yeah this is all unlawful yeah now the core people judge said that it wasn't enough of a miscarriage of justice enough for him to grant of appeal because we were out of time of Appeal yeah it wasn't now this was a case I was sentenced to 18 months in prison and I had to keep the police 125 thousand pounds at a time when when they got me in a position I had to keep in hundred twenty-five thousand pounds I was offered deals but secretive units within the met this mentor called the Met Intelligence Bureau within Scotland Yard's the deal would be that I would work for them in uniting them right yeah I would be an undercover agent for the security services and then they wouldn't have to pay the undertray five grand now what it turns out when my q-see went through the case was I never had to pay down to trade off because it was all unlawful anyway now the judge agreed in the court of appeal I've got it in black and white they was all unlawful but he didn't Warren he didn't give the justification so I haven't had the money returned to me which I should have and he didn't rule it unlawful because he didn't wait for him to give an appeal because we're out of time of Appeal the only true guideline is it has to be huge miscarriage of justice he doesn't think that four and a half years time yet having a yearly wage in a fine by the police just to put you in a position to have to have you try and work for them is enough now so bear in mind I knew what I'd gone on the previous court of appeal I have no confidence that this Court of Appeal judge would do what was right and in fact I still believe that they they would have done everything to try and find a way not to do it which is why I wasn't instantly freed when it was hurt it's why I spent another two weeks and so each compartment and not just two weeks they had until the 1st of August yeah what date did appeal result come on the 1st of August they maximize the amount of time I would still be held under those conditions now I'm seeing here now I'm still having to seek medical treatment I'm still I faced another court trial now on the 27 for this month for the exact same manner that in Leeds the exact same according with field didn't have to order that that carrot the copy didn't have to order it and in fact when they did order it I never thought they'd go through of it because I thought this was just to save a bit of face because obviously it's been proven of what they done the whole world's watching now the headlines on Tommy Robinson freedom and course conviction quash the headlines are Tommy Robinson to be reached right there saving a bit of face now what then turns out is this has not been bought this this case against me it's not been bought by the Crown Prosecution surface which is the normal procedure for crimes in Britain if there's a court case to CPS are the people they're independent organisation yeah they're the people that say ok there's nothing there independent from the police because they have to look at the police's evidence they have to act independently and say ok there's enough here to warrant it let's try them yeah this has come the CPS have actually said we want nothing to do with this this is the Attorney General the government this is the government who are all doing a retrial now what they say my retry me is that they don't think the two months two and a half month prison sentence observed the two months on solitary confinement the treatment they don't think that that warrants enough of a punishment for standing and talking no inciting and to anyone who says I was jeopardizing the trial the trial already finished yeah the trial really finished and these laws are being used on the muslim grooming gangs i think that we should have journalists challenging these in courts of law yeah why but the journalists are not challenging them they're not standing up for free speech or journalist rights they're actually happy to see them all they were old stake to see me imprisoned know i i saw some of your supporters writing to Amnesty International and other groups like that when you were in prison and I was copied on the replies they would say oh it was it was nothing to do with free speech of human rights it was a violation of a court order but now that the court of appeal has proved that false you would expect amnesty reporters without borders all these civil liberties groups to speak out now that you've been vindicated by the Court of Appeal dead silence not just from them where where the liberal journalists who would say well I disagree with Tommy Robinson style but this is the UK and we don't send people to prison for 10 weeks for always we've never sent a journalist prison well where is in seven years of contempt : where's where are those people who used to stand up for again as I speak about Islam and that is so terrifying for anyone to be seen to sort of side with or or or take up my case that they all run a mile you've seen yourself how many lawyer how impossible is it for find a lawyer to represent me we went through seven law firms before we found someone who would represent you in Canterbury it's because they're scared seven law firms we're almost at a time Tommy I want to ask you about two positive things when I when you were in prison I didn't speak with you but I your wife occasionally and other family members and they would pass on news to me and your wife said to me and I took it seriously the two things Boyd your spirits and I'm asking on behalf of our viewers who support you your wife said the two things that gave you encouragement were the letter she received via email and knowing that there were supporters around the world who were rallying in London and cities around the world and covering your legal fees for the crowdfunding why don't you tell me about both of those because I saw that picture of you coming out of prison with six big duffle bags I thought what's in the duffel bags you told me those were letters there's some cards from every single place when you tell me about those because you're in prison in a box my concern for all of this through everything we've done I've done is that in fact and then opening I will be killed I know oh yeah that's not that's something that in the 30 years was hard to come to terms on I've completely a I'm not easy with that no yeah my worry was they would have been for nothing my worry was the bearing in mind the government campaign the media campaign and all this hate campaign and all the campaign against us to slander me would be killed and forgotten about and it won't bring about change now and I really fought that deeply after leaving pews butt-headed just not far from here when we have a soldier beheading on our streets and in fact nothing doesn't just change the situation gets a lot worse since Lee Rigby was ahead in 2000 Muslims were allowed to go fight for Isis and 600 and come home yeah nothing's changed we're a more in danger than we've ever been yeah nothing's changed so when I can see a British Armed Service man beheaded on the street and the problem Excel and not just Excel but the politicians bend over each other for who can defend Islam the most after it then the exact sanctions and reason why the man done it why the boy why the man commits the the terrorist such that lyric beast killer handed a woman a piece of paper with 55 verses from the Koran that he says forced him to do it so when you still when we years on we still struggling to debate or talk about these issues and night of there's no mainstream people talking about it my fault I'll get killed and it won't have had an effect or it won't have made a difference and then I just watched the response to my arrest and how can that forget emotional Guinea's to say that going forward I now know that it would not it would I think was a revolution so again like if I have this minute first of all I'd like to talk to my supporters but to the to the government to the people in positions of power pulling strings like I am sitting in a winning position now because in this battle because even if I'm killed which I think you let happen for you you'd want to happen there's going to be a revolution in this country anyway and and for me I want debate change I want all these issues brought to the forefront the whole world has watched and talked about the Muslim paedophile grooming rape of our youth since my arrest I'm sitting here and I sat in prison yeah I didn't like it but I smiled many times and I smiled a lot and I smile because everything I do and then to be honest I sacrifice my life tomorrow to bring the change that's needed yeah if I'm willing to do that then all I want is the positive outcome yeah all I want it's a safe and prosperous future for the next generation of our children I don't think that we should be having to bow our heads in care every time you hear a bang in London I don't think for terrorist attacks last year that was successful 12 stopped all of these things the next generation of children being taught that they should be ashamed of who they are their identity their culture their history our own identity our own culture is under attack and I won't be us our next generations to feel pride in who they are pride in where they come from and they actually to understand who they are and where they come from and to understand the sacrifices have been given to them for free speech free speech which is being curtailed across this country all of those things always sit here now in quite a comfortable position I don't think I'm in a difficult position nothing they are I think they're because if I'm killed I'm going to succeed if I'm not killed I'm still going to succeed because I may be may have had a struggle period now but everything you try to do it's not going to work you will have to kill me and even by killing me or even by allowing me to be kill me it's still going to have it the negative effect that you wish for and if you can't see now the populist revolution that it's swinging I spoke about it is referred ten years well I said nine years ago on stages the swing from left to right that you can't stop there's no there's no organization with funds in the world that can stop it there's no police force that can stop it there's no government that can stop it none of you can stop it it's underway it's happening the elections in Austria the elections in Italy the elections across the whole of Europe it's coming and I know I'm on the right side of history so essentially I sit there and and those people support and sitting and seeing the public support gave me that that feeling that I've doubted and that feeling that I need to every time I kiss my kids and walk out of the door to know that it will carry on and it will continue no matter what happens or not and I know that and again what and I also know because in previous prison sentences or previous things that have happened but these the worlds watch this in the world is quite shocked with what's going on it's actually not the worst that's gone on that's far worse it's gone and I know I know yeah no I sit in a position where I'm comfortable and I know that and the minute I may be I may be having to concentrate on the 27th of September where I'm sure I'm sure I'm going to be offered a deal in this deal I'm gonna be told if I plead guilty I will get time served yeah that means you'll good you won't have to go back to prison and then and then the only difficult position in any of this it's just because of my family because I mean my son cried every day for two months I thought it would take a couple of weeks and it ease up a bit he didn't he absolutely rocked him no I didn't have to make a decision that will put my son it upset my family but but not I don't I don't want I don't want to do a deal idea when I left the English Defence League for the same reasons because they had me over a barrel ready to go back to prison in solitary confinement I don't want to be in that position again I don't want to make a mistake again so I don't know yeah it's that I know I know now I see it comfortably now and I know that the male what happens on the 27 September where I really believe I'll be back in prison because unless I could say unless I come to an agreement with them that saves their face I think I'll get slammed and then and under whatever technicality they used to say that the facts are the court case had finished the facts are I didn't say anything that could have jeopardized jeopardize that trial the facts are journalists across our country breach reporting restrictions day in day out every week there's a reporting restriction breach the facts are no one goes to jail for it the facts are that the British public and the world have viewed this they've seen what's going on I sit here very comfortable knowing that my family will forever be looked after I've got no worry about anymore that was my main worry I'm small guns blazing and I'm blazing in a way that I think I'm going into positions and places where even when I worked for us for you I knew you had my best interest at higher I knew you did you didn't what way if I said I'm going to do this as right you'd be saying no you're going to get seriously hurt you can end up in prison I think that to be able to bring about the changes needed you you can't think about that or worry about those things you can because you'll never get the change done that's needed so I now know that even coming out of this coming out of core the 27 September I will go full steam ahead and I don't need to worry anymore or I don't have to doubt anymore that a my family won't be looked after and B the people won't care because what really come what really was our really it was a bit was reading the letters arguments from 2 o'clock 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. every day that was my tried to get self in the regime and on rate and the letters and knowing how much it means and the feeling the passion the has become a symbol it's not all it wasn't all about because of me or because of wiser it become a symbol for people who feel oppressed who feel silenced who feel marginalized who feel that they're being they're being led down a path and our country's been led down a path and they they're concerned and I've read so many letters of concern from grandmothers from mothers from old people young people gay people straight people Muslim people I have letters from everyone everywhere and what become a parent is them the size of the feeling and I think that was viewed by the tens of thousands of people marched on West Minister after seven days I think that they should really it should be a wake-up call for them not for me well I keep getting told I'm in a different position even by my lawyers what I think I am I know I know I know what they're doing I'm gonna do and I want to play a part whatever part I can in bringing awareness and attention to issues that are quite frankly not just being ignored but being covered up we'll be there on September 27th at the Old Bailey as they put you to trial hey Daryl Bailey is a core for the biggest the biggest terrorists or murder trials the most have senior core of our country I'm therefore talking into a iPhone that's like a courtroom and we know it did and bridges a trial because the trial ended so we know the Verde has been given the judge actually said that I'm in there and just again I'll just finish on these these reporting restrictions i sensing I sense these laws being used and I'll go off point again now at one point I was arrested and I was given a football tempt given under football or legislation and what they said is they wanted to ban me from football stadiums now included in this ban was a map that would ban me from the entire Muslim community of Lewin and the lumen town said huh so on Saturdays I would not be allowed into Luton my hometown yeah the train station Town Center or the entire they they drew a map around the entire Muslim community know what they've done in this case was they used football legislation to try and invoke this law which would limit my freedoms yeah now it was thrown out of court by a judge it cost me thousands of pounds to defend the judges comments where the case against me was dishonest vague and cagey it wasn't the police cause beds police actually stood up for me in the case when they were in court it was the foot policing unit which is the home office it was the government yes now I these reporting restrictions I believe I still belief are just another law and another way of silencing and stopping people from being knowing the full details staying down of what's happening in these seas and essentially the minute this case is done on the 27th of September I'm gonna work with others to bring videos and documentaries to every town and see from every town and see with the details and all of the people who are in power this is why they don't like me I believe because the people in power as in the people who took payoffs didn't lose their pensions no these young girls being raped stood by and allowed it police officers senior police officers politicians care workers I'm going to find them and the whole British public is going to be made aware who they are and what they ignored and the horrific crimes have been happening to generation of our children well Tommy will be there to cover you you're a former employee of ours but we still support you in your mission I've called you the last lion of the UK and lions are untamable and lions

how much they support me hey Tommy thanks for spending time with accessory yes that's my feature interview with Tommy Robinson the last lion of the United Kingdom what he told us was heartbreaking enraging inspiring desperate but a little bit hopeful - Tommy has to go back to court the Attorney General is insisting on a retrial for contempt of court for that same incident back in Leeds may they actually want to convict him again maybe to throw him back in prison again just yesterday I received a new invoice from Tommy's law firm Carson K they're a good firm who won at the court of appeal but
