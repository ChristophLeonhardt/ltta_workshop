1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,320
A FLORIDA COP CITES AN IMAGINARY
LAW WHILE THREATENING A

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,620
21-YEAR-OLD BLACK MAN FOR,
JAYWALKING?

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,131
IT'S KIND OF FUZZY, BUT
FORTUNATELY THE WHOLE THING WAS

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:12,810
CAUGHT ON VIDEO, LET'S TAKE A
LOOK.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,460
WHAT IS IT THAT WE DID WRONG
OFFICER?

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,869
TAKE YOUR CAMERA AND POINTED
OVER THERE AT THE RED HAND.

7
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,179
THAT IS A CROSSWALK.

8
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:30,779
YOU WERE IN THE CROSSWALK, AND
NUMBER TWO, THERE WAS A RED

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,989
SIGN.

10
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:39,250
YOU ARE BEING LEGALLY DETAINED ñ

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,500
[ INAUDIBLE ]

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,019
PUT YOU IN JAIL.

13
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:50,950
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW RIGHT
THERE.

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,950
YOU LOOK AT ME.

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,950
[ INAUDIBLE ]

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,950
YOU'RE GOING TO WALK TO MY CAR.

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,950
I'M ABOUT TO PUT YOU IN JAIL.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,950
FOR WHAT?

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,950
DISOBEYING A DIRECT ORDER.

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,640
THAT IS NOT DISOBEYING.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
RESISTING.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
THAT IS NOT RESISTING.

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
LISTEN TO ME.

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I AM DOING YOU A FAVOR.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,570
I AM NOT TELLING YOU AGAIN.

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,159
YOU GOT YOUR ID ON YOU?

27
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,950
NO I DON'T.

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,749
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

29
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:13,749
[ INAUDIBLE ]

30
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,140
THERE'S ANOTHER INFRACTION.

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,760
IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA YOU
HAVE TO HAVE ID ON YOU TO

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,790
IDENTIFY WHO YOU ARE.

33
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,719
I CAN CONTINUE FOR UP TO SEVEN
HOURS.

34
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,260
YEAH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,649
FLORIDA DOES HAVE A STOP AND
FRISK LAW THAT ALLOWS OFFICERS

36
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:34,399
TO DETAIN INDIVIDUALS UNDER
CRIMINAL SUSPICION IN ORDER TO

37
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,770
GUIDE ñ TO IDENTIFY THEM, BUT
ONE, HE TOLD THE OFFICER HIS

38
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,369
NAME AND STATE OF WHEN ASKED,
AND NUMBER TWO, THE STOP IN

39
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,320
FIRST LAW IS NOT STATUTE THAT
THE POLICE OFFICER SAID,

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,020
AND NUMBER THREE, JAYWALKING IS
IDENTIFIED AS A NONCRIMINAL

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,930
OFFENSE IN FLORIDA CODE.

42
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,259
SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION GUYS, IS
THIS INTIMATE OR MALICIOUS?

43
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,290
DID THE COP NOT KNOW THE RULE,
OR WAS HE JUST GOING ON A

44
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,290
POWER TRIP HERE?

45
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,290
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

46
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,940
I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT WAS
IGNORANCE OR HIM BEING

47
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,240
MALICIOUS.

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,481
YOU CAN ONLY SPECULATE ON THAT
AND I DON'T REALLY WANT TO

49
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,669
SPECULATE ON THAT.

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,360
WHAT I DO KNOW IS, BOTH ARE
PRETTY BAD.

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,111
IF YOU ARE A COP AND YOU ARE
IGNORANT OF THE LAWS, HOW

52
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,521
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT AND
SERVE?

53
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:18,490
AND IF YOU DID THIS WITH
MALICIOUS INTENT,

54
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,190
ñ INTENT, KNOWING WHAT THE LAWS
ARE, THEN I THINK THAT ALSO

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,720
SPEAKS TO HOW YOU ARE NOT FIT TO
BE A COP.

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,960
I AGREE EXACTLY WITH THAT
ASSESSMENT.

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,160
IS UNCLEAR IF THIS WAS SORT OF
HIM JUST PICKING ON THIS

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,900
GUY, OR IF HE GENUINELY THOUGHT
HE DISOBEYED, BUT EITHER WAY

59
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,540
THAT IS AWFUL, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO YOUR JOB CORRECTLY.

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,970
JUST GIVE HIM A TICKET FOR
JAYWALKING, I GET IT, HE

61
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,970
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN JAYWALKING.

62
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,320
I DO IT TOO, IF I WERE CAUGHT I
WOULD ACCEPT THE TICKET AND

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,420
MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE.

64
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,790
BUT WHY DOES HE START TREATING
HIM LIKE A CRIMINAL FOR

65
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,790
JAYWALKING?

66
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,270
WHY DOES HE MAKE STATEMENTS THAT
IMPLY THAT JAYWALKING IS A

67
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,270
CRIMINAL OFFENSE?

68
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,900
IT IS OBVIOUS NOT JUST A ñ IT IS
ALWAYS A NOT A, NO OFFENSE,

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,200
I THINK MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT.

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,290
IF THERE WAS MALICIOUS INTENT, I
THINK HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BANKING

71
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,200
ON A YOUNG MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THE LAW IS FOR HIMSELF, SO

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,260
MAYBE JUST LIE TO HIM AND SCARE
HIM.

73
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,250
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS INTENTION
WAS.

74
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,180
EITHER WAY, YOU WANT TO CREATE
AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE

75
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,660
PEOPLE TRUST YOU AS A COP,
RIGHT?

76
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,210
THAT THE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE
CALLING YOU IF THEY NEED

77
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,280
YOU FOR HELP.

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,730
AND OFTEN TIMES WE DO STORIES
ABOUT THE WAY THAT CERTAIN

79
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,980
DISENFRANCHISED GROUPS REACTS TO
COPS, PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE,

80
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,500
WHY ARE YOU REACTING THAT WAY?

81
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,810
I WOULD REACT THAT WAY TO COPS
IF THEY WERE LYING TO ME

82
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,300
ABOUT WHAT THE LAWS ARE, IF THEY
TREAT ME LIKE A CRIMINAL

83
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,710
STRICTLY FOR JAYWALKING.

84
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,481
OKAY, YOU SHOULD JAYWALK, BUT
GIVE HIM A CITATION AND

85
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:52,220
MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

86
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,750
I SUPPOSE YOU GIVE HIM A
CITATION.

87
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,430
I THINK YOU COULD HAVE JUST
SAID, HEY MAN, SORRY TO BOTHER

88
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,210
YOU, BUT YOU JAYWALK BACK THERE
AND I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT WE

89
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,349
GOT ACCIDENT AROUND HERE ñ
ACCIDENTS AROUND HERE, WHEN

90
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:07,180
PEOPLE CROSS THE STREET IN THE
MIDDLE, SO JUST DON'T DO IT.

91
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,630
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IT.

92
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,361
THE WHOLE THING DURING THE
VIDEO, SOUNDED LIKE HE THE

93
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:16,820
CALL ALREADY HAD A HEAD OF STEAM
GOING ALREADY.

94
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,449
WHY DON'T YOU POINT YOUR CAMERA
OVER THERE?

95
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,500
THEY TAKE THE CAMERA THING
OBVIOUSLY IN AN AGGRESSIVE WAY.

96
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,050
YES, THEY HATE THE CAMERAS.

97
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,300
THEY DON'T DO THAT AS THEIR
YOUTUBE MOMENT, THEY VIEW

98
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,680
THAT AS A PROBLEM.

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,540
SO, RIGHT AWAY I THINK THERE WAS
FRICTION, IF I CAN JUST SAY,

100
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,669
BETWEEN THE TWO, BUT THEN WHEN
HE START SERVING UP ALL THIS

101
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,349
CRAP ABOUT THE LAW, I THINK THEY
WERE DISCOUNTING ON THE GUY NOT

102
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,629
REALLY KNOWING THE LAW.

103
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,040
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE
BOTHERING PEOPLE ON THIS

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,639
KIND OF THING, AND ESPECIALLY TO
THIS LEVEL.

105
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,750
I MEAN, YOU GOT PEOPLE ON BATH
SALTS IN FLORIDA, GO DO

106
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,550
SOMETHING WITH THAT, RIGHT?

107
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,199
YOU ARE WASTING RESOURCES AND
TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON HARASSING

108
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,400
SOMEONE ACROSS THE STREET IN A
WAY THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE, RIGHT?

109
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,810
WHICH, AGAIN IS AGAINST THE LAW,
BUT ISN'T CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

110
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,099
SO, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT

111
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,099
INSPECTION WAS.

112
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:16,699
AND I THINK THE WORST ADJECTIVE
TO DESCRIBE THIS OFFICER WOULD

113
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,810
BE PETTY.

114
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,590
YOU DON'T WANT A PETTY POLICE
OFFICER.

115
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,889
HE HAS IMMENSE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR PROTECTING AND SERVING THE

116
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,280
COMMUNITY, AND HE IS JUST BEING
A REALLY ANNOYING, LITTLE BITCH.

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
RIGHT.

118
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,349
BEING ANNOYING IS BAD, BUT IT'S
A SAD DAY IN AMERICA WHEN

119
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:39,629
YOU COME AWAY FROM A STORY LIKE
THIS AND LIKE, JUST HAVE

120
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:42,360
LIKE, THIS HEAVY SIGH OF RELIEF
BECAUSE SOMEONE DIDN'T GET

121
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
SHOT AND KILLED.

122
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
THAT'S TRUE.

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,599
SO THAT IS ANOTHER SAD PART.

124
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,449
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THE COP TO
BE LIKE A HOTEL CONCIERGE WITH

125
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:55,620
THE GUY, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR A
LITTLE BIT LESS CONFRONTATION.

126
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,330
THESE SITUATIONS NEED TO BE
DEFUSED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

127
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,330
OFFICERS.

128
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,680
NOW THIS DIDN'T ESCALATE TO THE
POINT WHERE ANYBODY WAS

129
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,470
HARMED, BUT NONETHELESS, YOU
CAN DE-ESCALATE EVEN THE

130
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,009
INITIAL FRICTION, RIGHT?

131
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,599
IF I SEE YOU AGAIN I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO WRITE IT UP.

132
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,499
I AGREE, JUST A LITTLE
SENSITIVITY TO THE CLIMATE

133
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,900
THAT THEY ARE SERVING AND
WOULD BE NICE TO SEE, AND WE

134
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:33,789
DIDN'T SEE THAT, SO 

135
00:06:33,789 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT SUCKS.
