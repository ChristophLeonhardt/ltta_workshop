STRATEGY. THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE. AT SOME POINT IN LIFE, WE ALL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT TO BE VICTIMS OR VICTORS. DO WE WANT TO BE DEFINED BY SLIGHTS AND WRONGS? ONES THAT ARE PERCEIVED OR REAL? THAT WE SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF OTHERS. 242 YEARS AGO, OUR FOREFATHERS MADE THE DECISION THAT KIND OF SITTING AROUND BEMOANING OUR FATE UNDER BRITISH RULE WASN'T GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE. THEY DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO CHOSE FREEDOM AND LIBERTY ROOTED IN A SENSE OF VIRTUE OVER DESPAIR AND HOPELESSNESS. AND WITH COURAGE, SACRIFICE, AND AN INDOMITABLE SPIRIT AND AN ABIDING FAITH IN GOD, WE WON OUR INDEPENDENCE AND CREATED THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. POWERFUL FORCES IN TODAY'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THOUGH, ARE AT WAR WITH THAT FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE AMERICAN STORY. IN FACT, MANY THINK THE FOUNDING OF OUR COUNTRY WAS INHERENTLY CORRUPT AND EVEN ILLEGITIMATE, AND THEY HAVE MADE A DECISION TO RUN AGAINST THAT VERSION OF AMERICA. IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ACTUAL PLAN TO GROW AMERICAN PROSPERITY AND KEEP US SAFE, DEMOCRATS ARE EMBRACING VICTIMHOOD AS A POLITICAL PLATFORM THIS MIDTERM CYCLE. DEMOCRAT STACEY ABRAMS IS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN GEORGIA. THE MIASMA OF FEAR THAT'S CREATED BY VOTER SUPPRESSION IS AS MUCH ABOUT TERRIFYING PEOPLE ABOUT TRYING TO VOTE AS IT IS ABOUT ACTUALLY BLOCKING THEIR ABILITY TO DO SO. Laura: WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT? VOTER REGISTRATION HAS REACHED A RECORD LEVEL IN GEORGIA, AND THERE WAS A 75% VOTER PARTICIPATION THERE IN 2016. THE AVERAGE NATIONWIDE WAS ONLY 55%. ABRAMS IS SELLING FEAR VICTIMHOOD AT THE IDEA OF, WEIGHT, ILLEGAL ALIENS VOTING? THE THING IS, THE BLUE WAVE IS AFRICAN-AMERICANS. IT'S WHITE, LATINO, ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. IT'S MADE UP OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN TOLD THEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF BEING HERE. IT'S COMPRISED OF THOSE WHO ARE DOCUMENTED AND UNDOCUMENTED. Laura: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO GEORGIA. DID YOU CATCH THAT? SOUNDS LIKE ABRAMS HAD HER SAID THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WERE PART OF THE BLUE WAVE. BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE? HOW DOES THAT NOT DILUTE THE ILLEGAL VOTES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS OF ALL COLORS AND ALL BACKGROUNDS? IT GETS WORSE. IN MASSACHUSETTS, WHERE FOR YEARS ELIZABETH WARREN HAS SHAMELESSLY PEDDLED THE IDEA THAT SHE'S A CHEROKEE INDIAN. MY MB HAS WALKED BY THAT PICTURE AT LEAST A THOUSAND TIMES, REMARKED THAT HER FATHER, HAD HIGH CHEEKBONES LIKE ALL OF THE INDIANS. BEING NATIVE AMERICAN HAS BEEN PART OF MY STORY I GUESS SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN. Laura: WAS SHE BORN IN 1985? I THINK THAT'S WHEN SHE STARTED TO TELL THE STORY. ANYWAY, WARREN IS TRYING TO PLAY THE VICTIM. AFTER YEARS OF TAKING CRITICISM FOR HER NATIVE AMERICAN CLAIMS, WARREN, WITH AN ION 2020, TRIED TO GET IT ALL OUT OF THE WAY. SHE RELEASED AND EFFECTIVE VIDEO DURING A DNA SPECIALIST. WHAT ARE THE FACTS SAY? YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTRY IN YOUR PEDIGREE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONED MY HERITAGE AND MY FAMILY HISTORY. MAYBE THEY DO IT TO INSULT ME. MAYBE THEY DO IT TO DISTRACT FROM THE KINDS OF CHANGES I'M FIGHTING FOR. Laura: ACCORDING TO A DNA STUDY, ANALYZED BY STANFORD'S CARLOS BUSTAMANTE, WHO WORKS FOR 23 AND MAY, THE ADVISOR OF THAT COMPANY, WARREN IS POSSIBLY 1/1024, WHICH IS 0.09% NATIVE AMERICAN. THAT'S WHERE THE SCALE GOES. IT GOES FROM .09% TO I DON'T KNOW, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. ACCORDING TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES," SCIENTIST SAY THE AVERAGE EUROPEAN-AMERICAN IS 0.18% NATIVE AMERICAN. SO THAT WOULD MAKE WARREN LESS NATIVE AMERICAN THAN THE AVERAGE EUROPEAN-AMERICAN. WAIT A SECOND. WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO LIBERAL CONCERNS ABOUT CULTURAL APPROPRIATION? I GUESS THAT'S OUT THE WINDOW. WARREN IS KIND OF A TYPICAL DENIGRATE HER. SHE'S RACIALLY OBSESSED, AND LET'S FACE IT, IT'S EASIER THAN BEING FACTUALLY INFORMED. SHE IS WILLING TO SCAM THE SYSTEM, IN THIS CASE PLAY IN INDIAN TO GET A BOOST PROFESSIONALLY OR IN THIS CASE POLITICALLY. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, HER DNA SPECIALIST, CARLOS BUSTAMANTE, FLATLEY ADMITTED THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN USE NATIVE AMERICAN SAMPLES FOR THE TEST. SERIOUSLY? TO MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF THOSE SAMPLES, HE IS ONE FROM MEXICO, PERU, AND COLOMBIA. KEEP THIS UP AND WARREN IS GOING TO BE CLAIMING THAT SHE'S MORE LATINA THAN ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ BY 2020. SPEAKING OF LATINOS, A NEW MIGRANT CARAVAN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA, THE SECOND IN SIX MONTHS, IS NOW HEADED UP THROUGH MEXICO TO THE UNITED STATES THIS WEEK. IT ALREADY HAS 1600 MEMBERS. NATURALLY, DEMOCRATS HAVE STARTED THEIR OLD NARRATIVE ABOUT TRUMP SEPARATING FAMILIES OF THE BORDER. IF ONLY THEY HAD THE SAME CONCERN FOR AMERICANS BRUTALLY VICTIMIZED BY ILLEGALS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, TWO ILLEGALS HAVE COMMITTED VICIOUS RAPES JUST IN THE NEW YORK AREA. ONE FOLLOWED A NASSAU COUNTY WOMAN HOME, KNOCKED HER OUT, AND REPEATEDLY RAPED HER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. THEN THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS THOUGHT TO BE A MEMBER OF MS-13. HE BROKE INTO THE BEDROOM OF AN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW AND RAPED HER ON A BUNK BED WITH HER BROTHER BELOW THEM. MEANWHILE, WE HEAR ALMOST NOTHING ON THOSE STORIES OR SO MANY MORE LIKE THEM FROM DEMOCRATS WHO AT THE SAME TIME AGONIZED OVER NONCITIZENS OVERWHELMING OUR BORDER PATROL. WHEN LESLIE STAHL TRIED TO MELT HEARTS WITH HER FAMILY SEPARATION NARRATIVE LAST NIGHT, THE PRESIDENT SET HER STRAIGHT. ARE YOU WILLING TO REINSTITUTE THAT POLICY. YOU SAID WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING? President Trump: WHAT I CAN SAY IS THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FROM COMING INTO A COUNTRY, NAMELY OUR COUNTRY, ILLEGALLY. I'M NOT GOING TO ASK IT AGAIN. President Trump: YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IT WAS THE SAME AS OBAMA. Laura: DONALD TRUMP HAS EXPOSED THE FRAUDULENT NATURE OF THE LEFT-WING ARGUMENTS AND THEIR WEAK NARRATIVES. THERE IS A SUDDEN BOUNCE. YOU FELT IN THE "60 MINUTES" INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT. THE LEFT IS FUMING THAT 60 MINUTES ACTUALLY AIR THE INTERVIEW. BUT HE HAS THE EXTRA BOUNCE IN HIS STEP AND THE SENSE OF HIS PARTY IS NOW ON THE RISE AGAIN. FOLLOWING THE KAVANAUGH BATTLE, YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO THAT THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT'VE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE THAT VICTIMHOOD FOR POLITICAL GAIN IS NOT A GREAT STRATEGY. IT WON'T WORK, AND IT HASN'T. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE REPUBLICANS MAY HAVE FINALLY FOUND THEIR GROOVE. THEY ARE OUTSELLING THE PEACE, PROSPERITY, AND SECURITY AGENDA THAT TRUMP WON ON AND IS DELIVERING ON. I DON'T KNOW. IN THE END, I THINK MOST
