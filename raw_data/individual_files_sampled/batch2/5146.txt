the following program is brought to you in living color on NBC from Chicago Illinois NBC News reports Democratic National Convention that was the NBC News open animation for the network's 1968 coverage the anger and division we see in the country today may seem unprecedented but boy we've seen it before fifty years ago America seemed to be coming apart at the seams party against party generation against generation tribe against tribe it was 1968 a violent year culminating in a violent Democratic convention the city of Chicago hosted 50 years ago this week Tom Brokaw you were there and a you give us this look back at America's Great Divide and it's terrible consequences the Democratic National Convention Chicago August 1968 the country deeply divided the war in Vietnam claiming hundreds of American lives every week the convention was a disaster waiting to happen the Democratic contenders were vice president Hubert Humphrey and anti-war senators Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern Robert Kennedy had been killed two three months earlier a move to draft his brother Ted went no world President Lyndon Johnson had withdrawn from the race over Vietnam Hebrew retreated to his Texas ranch and marked his 60th birthday on the phone constantly trying to manipulate the Convention on behalf of Hubert Humphrey watching as his party tore itself apart unless we stop killing and slaughtering these boys in Vietnam the American people will not support any administration and power that continues it thousands of young anti-war demonstrators descended on Chicago they hated the war and the establishment that promoted it many flew Vietcong flags they threw rocks and bottles at police calling them pigs they wanted to provoke a confrontation and they got just that Chicago police were under the iron control of Mayor Richard J daily there was trouble inside the convention as well on day two of Vietnam Peace Initiative failed to pass angry delegates demonstrated until the house band was ordered to drown them out continue to are now in the aisles here with billy clubs clearing people up this surely is the first time that policeman have ever entered the floor of a convention in the United States on days free and nearby Grant Park police with billy clubs and tear gas broke up a rally but thousands of protesters who refused to disperse the police formed into a wedge waited in and the battle was on that night as the convention nominated Hubert Humphrey police moved on demonstrators trying to march to the convention hall and all hell broke loose America's fault line open up violently right on Michigan Avenue police swirling all around us people screaming through the paddy wagons a scene of wildest order the whole world was watching appalled at both sides news of the violence soon reached the convention floor Connecticut Governor Abraham Ribicoff a McGovern supporter took aim at Mayor Richard Daley and with George McGovern as president of the United States we wouldn't have to have Gestapo staff tactics in the streets of Chicago mr. Daley is not pleased how hard it is to accept the truth pretty gutsy babe daily fiercely defended his Police Department and famously misspoke in the process gentlemen get to think straight once and for all the policeman isn't there to create disorder the policeman is there to preserve this order the morning after America's generation will divide was on full display one of the radical organizers Jerry Rubin police are brutal police protect the status quo and police consider enemies of the state anybody who stands up and challenges what the police protect Chicago Police spokesman Frank Sullivan these people are revolutionaries bent on the destruction of the government of the United States of America there are a pitiful handful what I saw there were American young men and women being savagely beaten by policemen simply because they were out on the street protesting against policies over which they have had very little to say Hubert Humphrey after a long time of yearning for it has finally won his party's nomination and in the opinion of a great many people there a serious question now about how much the nomination he won is worth Humphry faced an almost impossible task to bridge the divide to unify his party we do not want a police state but we need a stage of law and order and neither mob violence nor police brutality have any place in America even as he spoke the showdown and the streets continued the final enduring image of a disastrous convention old men running this convention were absolutely determined to have everything their way and they almost succeeded and in the process they all they may have succeeded in losing the election just days later Richard Nixon opened his campaign in Chicago and was welcomed with a ticker tape parade he promised law and order and that November a nation still deeply divided narrowly elected him president of the United States and our special thing so once he knew senior producer Andy Franklin and editor Bob Kaplan for that piece and Tom my god going into the convention it's it's hard for people to imagine today you had the Tet Offensive in January you had McCarthy shocking LBJ in February in March of course LBJ getting out April Martin Luther King assassinated June Bobbe assassinated it seemed like the country was coming apart at the seams didn't it not just the country but the world I remember I was a young reporter 28 years old and in August today you're Russia invaded Czechoslovakia so and there were 15,000 people who died in Vietnam day who are including one of my very closest friends I went home from this convention to South Dakota my father my parents for real dirt road Democrats my dad was in a rage about what he and witness against the demonstrators he hated the war in Vietnam my brother was a Marine serving there at the time but he saw the disillusion of the American spirit about how we come together peacefully to solve problems the fact is that a lot of these demonstrators were very peaceful they came here for the right reason Jerry Rubin and Tom Hayden and the others knew what they were doing and they wanted to provoke the police they did that successfully because that was their political objective so the party went home from here in tatters really and Hubert Humphrey came as close as he did in part because he came out against the war in the closing days my friend Jeff Greenfield was still with you made a very astute observation he said you know you have to remember I'm sure that a lot of those cops had sons that were serving in Vietnam they came out of that culture and a lot of them had served in World War two nonetheless it was a brutal brutal reaction to what was going on and for the people who were the radicals in the peace movement they got what they wanted they tried to cleave the country and they did just that well I'm Jeff Greenfield Tom talked about his family who were dirt road Democrats certainly my my mom's family also dirt road Democrats my grandma always had a picture of FDR hanging up and in her her kitchen because they were in Dalton Georgia and Rome Georgia in the great depths of the Great Depression and they always thanked FDR for helping them survive but between 1968 and 1972 they left that Democratic Party in large part because of the images that we showed right there yeah I think that Convention and particularly the images which which were endlessly rebroadcast were vivid demonstrations of that generational and cultural chasm not even a gap what I find so interesting when we talk about the echoes of it is that what that did to the Democratic Party and to the political process is literally still with us the effort to try to bring more people into the nominating process because back in 68 most of those delegations were held by the party leaders just Saturday two days ago the Democratic National Committee once again created rules to try to minimize the roles of the insiders and maximize the roles of ordinary people that fight half a century on has characterized what's happened to the Democratic Party and to some extent the Republicans ever since and it was because of the feeling engendered at that convention that the process was closed there are people who tell you that it had negative impacts that it destroyed the nature of what a party is that it helped Outsiders like a Donald Trump take over a party but we are still living with the consequences of what Tom reported so well just a few minutes ago and that's that's 50 years on and then rather one of the most stunning moments of the 68 convention inside at least was when the police came in and started roughing up reporters and actually you famously got or infamously got punched and and it just it didn't it didn't look like an image that we were used to seeing in America well two points one historians will be talking about this convention fifty a hundred years from now there's never been any convention anywhere near it in terms of the way it convulsed the country that many Americans those of us who were working in Chicago both inside the hall outside and what was called the Battle of Michigan Avenue in the granite park everybody was saying to themselves what's happened to our country we're better than this what's happened to the country and of course around the world because it is true that the whole world was watching due to television coverage there was this sense of what's happened to the United States of America so the psychological impact of this is things Johnson and others have written the psychological impact of it and its effect on American politics not just on the Democratic Party but only Republican Party as well and on the whole body politic of America but for those who sing themselves today and and I find myself among them sometimes that we've never been as divided at this then go back and start in 1968 because what they'd been race riots in the streets the Tet Offensive in January she pointed out Lyndon Johnson removing himself from possibility of reelection in March dr. Martin Luther King assassinated in April Bobby Kennedy assassinated in June the Russian move into check of up in Czechoslovakia great force I mean a lot of things came together in that bed steamy pit and by the the scene both outside and inside the hall was something from a bad American movie they had steel fences around the amphitheater barbed wire the smell of the stockyards was everywhere many of the elevators didn't works telephones were not very dependable and that taxi drivers were on strike he put all events together in this called room of the Democratic convention of 1968 in conceived way that at that point the country was in the situation of as the poet said things were in the saddle the senator could not hold and it did not hold any many ways of dasn't Hill to this point Joe that convention that year 1968 Chicago was certainly part of it was a true fault line of fracturing of American culture and certainly of American politics that continues on today and Michael Beschloss part of the background for what happened in 1968 and specifically what happened in Chicago because I am a flat-out eternal optimist I say this that for those of you out there today and Michael you can give me your opinion on my thought when I finish here for those of you out there today who think that this country is in dire straits and up against it we might not survive I would ask you to consider just the single week in Chicago 50 years ago when Dan and I and Tom were getting gassed and running away from a police riot over 200 young men were killed in Vietnam in 1968 the total of death killed ki a in Vietnam was over 16,000 so pumped the brakes on your desperation about 2018 and reflect on the fact that we survived and even prospered after 1968 yeah you're right Mike and you know you have to believe if you if you're an historian or close student of history American history you've got to be an optimist because you look over 200 years our system does change to respond to these things you know the Democratic convention that year the majority of Democrats across the country had turned against the Vietnam War but LBJ and the establishment had such a grip on what the delegates did on that floor that they couldn't pass an anti Vietnam War platform plank they nominated Hubert Humphrey who had not campaigned in a single primary totally unrepresentative and as Jeff mentioned you know the system changed it's a lot more open and you have to assume that we learn from these things you know it took a long time for Congress finally to demand that the Vietnam War ended but it did after Watergate you know Pellatt politicians across the country looked at a president who was forced to resign because of corruption because of scandal and they said I want to make sure I'm the opposite of that Americans demanded it you know Peggy though I completely agree the United States learns and the arc and Sevilla zation is forever upward but I am reminded yeah that it was 50 years since Chicago it was 25 years again on a very small point but a personal point that I started knocking on doors to run for office and after my first day of knocking on doors I was with my mom and dad that night and they said what do you learn today I said I learned that you're either on John Wayne side or your own Jane Fonda's side and there is no in-between I was I was shocked at how split even in Pensacola how split everybody was and of course it was a joke back then but 25 years later it seems we're still there yeah Time magazine had a cover 50 years ago 1968 that said America divided they said we are different we are two countries and I think of that often because all of my life since then it has been America divided sometimes sharply and painfully sometimes less so but it's just true when time captured it I want to mention quickly Joe something optimistic I guess 1968 was a brutal and heroine year but in December of 1968 NASA sent up a spaceship and Jim Lovell and Frank Borman were on it it was Apollo 8 I think they were attempting to circle the moon during that trip they read from the Bible you know it was live broadcast from the inside of the space capsule they read from the Old Testament they read as I remember it from Genesis in the beginning was the word and NASA shortly after that broadcast received a telegram from a woman in the Midwest as I remember it who said the simple words thank you guys for saving 1968 it was a transcendent moment and a beautiful punctuation after the end of a painful harrowing year and Susan page seven months later Neil Armstrong walked on the moon for probably all of us when we see the image of those Apollo rockets going off the launch pads it gives us chills America at its best you know if there's a lesson from John McCain who we were talking about earlier it's that you should be optimistic in general and optimistic about America in particular and you're thinking about the contrast with 50 years ago with 1968 think about the opportunities for someone like me for a woman in America so greatly expanded in the past 50 years or the racial diversity not a perfect nation but racial diversity in our country so much more fabric of the country now and it was that our treatment of the LGBT community I mean there are ways in which our society is better although there is no denying that we have some big divisions and challenges ahead all right our thanks to an incredible panel we need three hours just with this panel Tom Brokaw Dan Rather Michael Beschloss Susan pegs Jeff Greenfield Mike Barnicle and Peggy Noonan thank you
