so this here is the Lenovo yoga pro 3 tablet you can buy this particular tablet on the market right now for right around 500 bucks the reason why this thing is so interesting and so cool is the projector it's all about sort of this built-in display that they've added to the device that no other tablet on the market has so the projector is located right here on the back of the device but one of the cooler features is that it comes with a kickstand so you can actually detach the projector from the actual device and spin it out so you can put it down you can place it down on the ground or on a table like a kickstand you can also flip it all the way back around and if you had the ability to do it you can hang it from a wall so that it can display across a wall when I had the opportunity to bring this home and play with it downloaded the Netflix app took it into a relatively large room I'd say was probably a 10 by 10 room and hung it from the wall projected all the way across that room and the screen size itself projected out to about 8 feet and the picture was clear enough that you could absolutely tell what was going on it comes with manual focus so you have the ability once it's being projected to actually sharpen the focus once it gets to the depth that you want it to be so the built-in speakers worked they're not the most fantastic speakers that I've ever heard but what I will say is that for a device this size it absolutely filled the room with sound in total I watched probably four hours of video using the projector with this device and by the end of all of that I still had 60 percent battery remaining if you wanted to use it in a professional way you absolutely could use it to make it up to give a presentation you could use some form of slides like Google slides you could throw up a spreadsheet if you wanted to you could pull up a word doc you could do basically anything you wanted if you wanted to show someone something from your email it's very easy to just access Gmail and project that onto a wall this particular tablet is running the Android lollipop OS which is the second most recent version of the Android OS to come out of the market it's not designed in a way that you'd see most other tablets it has this sort of like this column spine on the side over here which is meant to be held it's not very heavy which is very nice the screen size takes up a really good majority of the device itself so you're getting a lot of bang for your buck in terms of pixels and resolution which is really nice in terms of overall performance I thought that it was actually kind of sluggish in some cases the touchscreen wasn't really really receptive to my touch there was often a delay and the sluggishness really came in the chrome app where if you had a lot of different windows open a lot of different tabs within that application open at one time it would really slow down and almost grind to a halt in some cases I think that this device will find its niche audience if you will for people out there who are really serious about online video this is definitely a tool that will enhance your lifestyle it's one that works really well in that fashion as a competitor against Samsung Galaxy Tabs and against iPad pros and all of those other Apple devices I'm not sure it's going to stack up or perform particularly well but I think that there is an audience that will really enjoy this device
