Oh ABC News is reporting tonight that this comes after the special councils prosecutors told Trump's lawyers that they limit their questions for the president but still want to ask him about obstruction of justice according to ABC's reported was that news that triggered the president's tweets this morning yet despite Trump's frequent demands that somebody else should end the investigation the president repeatedly stopped short of trying to do so himself as we know and as Rudy Giuliani said today Trump already believes he has the authority to fire truck the fire mower in fact the ordered mowers firing last December accord the New York Times but relented when it's White House Counsel threatened to resign for that so if the president really believes he can fire moly and think since annelids any legitimate investigation why doesn't he do so Jimmy right now is Natasha Bertrand staff writer at the Atlantic Robert costinesti will report at the Washington Post and Seth Waxman former federal prosecutor let me start with Robert about this this thing that's going on he gets up but he says I want I want Jeff Sessions who he picked this Attorney General to get rid of the whole mower investigation just get rid of it and then somebody comes out later his I guess lawyer spokesman Rudy choices that's just his opinion it seems to me either is saying once the guy fired and he means it or he doesn't mean it and what is he doing if he's not saying he wants him fired what's he doing is he's going after the credibility of Robert MO and the entire investigation and he's not pulling the trigger he's just attacking and attacking over and over again because he knows the reports coming he knows he needs to make a decision on the presidential interview is he saying it's a legitimate investigation or an illegitimate vestigators why doesn't he fire them all if he really believes that the probe by well her fault Robert Moore is illegitimate that it isn't a legitimate action in the federal government if he believes that he should determinate it does he believe that he would like to based on my conversations with this usually that's a legitimate he does believe it's illegitimate why does he get rid of because he's being told by Republicans on Capitol Hill you're gonna have a midterm disaster if you get rid of the special showing another word something gonna in touchless he honestly believes it's not a legitimate investigation he honestly believes he has authority to end it but he won't know I mean we saw the reaction and after Helsinki that disaster summit where there was bipartisan condemnation and he knows that this would be politically disastrous for him especially as Bob said ahead of the midterm aligned it's just mean did he he's guilty Seth and that's what he's worried about he's afraid they got him they got him on obstruction they got him over and over and over again obstruction well I don't think he believes that in his heart of hearts he's out there saying this is a hoax this is a witch and I think he thinks it is illegitimate the reason why he's not getting rid of it is because he can't the special prosecutor rules regulations say that it's only the Attorney General and now since he's recused it is rod Rosen why does he keep saying he's got a lawyer named Rudy Giuliani once America's mayor now his lawyer who says he has the authority as of today to fire more the whole shebang why doesn't he do it if he has the authority well Rudy may say that he may say that but again he doesn't as a legal I think so you don't think this Supreme Court would back him up if he said I'm the head of the executive branch I picked sessions to head the Justice Department I can tell them what to do that's how we have elections in this country well we came down this path once before in 1973 when Archibald Cox was fired a DC federal judge here had a three senators that filed an injunction and that judge found that the termination of Archibald Cox was illegal and in addition when they try to disband the entire special counsel's office that's a much lost his job though yeah and he Jaworski picked it up and ran with it in the women cops never got Cox was a Kennedy guy but he never got the job again did get rid of him but Joanne Jaworski picked it up and ran in the points that he did get rid of the guy can't Trump do the same thing get rid of mower but he can try but when we could have senators today follow that same sort of civil lawsuit seeking an injunction I'm counting computer I open the show we're trying to figure out what it is so somebody help me either Trump's believes this is a legitimate and he has the power to get rid of this guy where he believes it is legitimate he's just biessing us or is a coup d'etat because he is suggested as a dark deep state out there up he's democratic seventeen members of the prosecuting team all out to get him there really it's a dangerous group of people that should be stopped if he really believes that what's he gonna do about it well Trump needs a foil he needs someone to be in opposition to you at all times and I think the next election right exactly and this is you know we say it over and over again but it really is true it's raw meat to his base and he wants the ability to say that there's a deep state out to get me which is run which is a legitimate which is evil and he's the only person they got in the United States that protected them for the deep state and he's got a lot on his plate he's got Paul Manafort on trial in Northern Virginia he has Michael Cohen his longtime lawyer and fixer signaling he's willing to cooperate with federal investigators he knows his son Donald Trump jr. is under federal scrutiny he knows the federal wondering behind the scenes right now was there criminal intent in any of the president's tweets or his decision why is he scrambling like a quarterback why is he racing around right now making all these charges this morning is he fear that that product that prosecution is coming at him would be for Labor Day or sometime after the election what's the or appears well I think he fears it's a long term after the election but I think he also sees this whole thing coming to a head where all these people are either testifying or against him we're providing information and at the end of the day Paul Manta Ford I think is playing with house money if he beats this case great he'll fight it in DC but if he loses he can still walk into Muller's office still get a deal and he can testify and provide information against Donald Trump or the tweet today you see the president tweeted about Paul man of Ford saying he's getting a bad deal and him with a pardon PO I mean that's the man federal prosecutors believe that man affords planes for a pardon Natasha he could still cooperate I mean prosecutors at former federal prosecutors I told you know from the complete freedom he walks out the door with all these tax charges again all this pile of time against 25 years to if you add it up facing him they're not gonna let him walk trot mowers not gonna say goodbye have a nice day he's gonna give you five I may be give you a seven but Trump could give him zero I'd wait for Trump but anyway Trump's tweets today came after the New York Times reported last week that the president's tweets could bolster potential obstruction case against himself and that's made summit Trump's lawyers uneasy quote the fact that they are scrutinizing his actions under a section of the United States code entitled tampering with a witness victim or informant raised concerns for his lawyers up mr. Trump's exposure in the investigation Herbert Rudy Johnny says that what the president tweets cannot be evidence of obstruction that's Rudy talking but here he is now we have obstruction by tweet well I don't think the Congress has yeah I mean structure happens this way hey buddy has a gun right doesn't happen by yeah million flowers hey Seth give me about the rules because they keep changing I love the weighted rudy by the way I'm always been impressed by but lately he's just cute I mean there's no thing that nothing in the code about colors yeah but there is something called a conspiracy and advancing against peers they change the words a little bit you're in trouble this now thing about tweet it's cute to say tweet but this whole government's been run by tweets they don't stop now brother yeah no obstructs tweets can be evidence just like anything else anything that comes out of a defendant or target or subjects mouth whether it's an email a tweet a text message or an oral statement is evidence if someone says I'm gonna go kill person B tomorrow on a tweet and that person ends up dead you sure no prosecutors are going to be holding up that tweet saying look what he said just yesterday so the idea that a tweet is somehow just cute and can't constitute evidence there is a file somewhere in Moeller's office that's the tweet master who every time there's a new tweet they put another tab in their file and say you know this is evidence piece number 647 can you read the president sort of cycle of tweeting can you tell this he get more excited does he tweet more Robert I mean the president spends most of the morning watching television up in the residence watching television thinking through his tweets it's him tweeting on his own and he watches the misspell of what causes the highest tweeting level because it seems like when he gets scared he tweets a lot well you see often with the president's style it's with the so-called witch-hunt his words talking about the Muller investigation and then there'll be a series of tweets not just one or two hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
