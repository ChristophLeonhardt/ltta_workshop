00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:05,451

13 OTHERS WOUNDED.

12
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:18,130
HOWEVER, THIS MORNING ON

13
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:19,398

26
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:42,354
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE

27
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:44,523
THAT ISIS HAS FALSELY CLAIMED

28
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:45,658

PARTICULAR CLAIM.

YESTERDAY, THOUGH, CANADA'S

35
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:59,471

38
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:06,345
INDIVIDUAL AND NATIONAL

39
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:06,712

00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:19,658
DEEP CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS

45
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,826
AS WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

46
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,695

00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,503
SHE WAS KILLED AS SHE WAS OUT

51
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:32,805
CELEBRATING A FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY.

52
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:35,374
SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO COLLEGE

53
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,575

54
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:41,680
PROPOSAL TO BAN HANDGUNS AFTER

55
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:42,147
THIS SHOOTING.

56
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:43,449
TELL US ABOUT IT.

57
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,718
>> THE PUBLIC SAFETY MINISTER

58
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,419
SAYS THAT PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN

59
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,587
TRUDEAU'S GOVERNMENT IS

60
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,422
PREPARED TO CONSIDER AN

61
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:51,390
OUTRIGHT BAN ON HANDGUNS.

62
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,558
HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS

63
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,525

64
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,360
ARGUMENTS FOR SUCH A BAN AND

65
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,328
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.

66
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:00,933
IT IS ALREADY MUCH HARDER TO

67
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:02,334
ACQUIRE GUNS LEGALLY IN CANADA

68
00:02:02,335 --> 00:00:00,000
THAN THE UNITED STATES.
