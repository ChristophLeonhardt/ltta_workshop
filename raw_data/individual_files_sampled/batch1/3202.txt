one of the things that I had was the ability to expunge from my mind the fact that I was a federal agent and I learned how to speak like them dress like them act like them and one of the things that I pretended to be was just as ruthless as they were and they understood that I could be as ruthless as as they were so they trusted me and it was a period of where they tested you to make sure that you were who you said you were so you had to know how to answer the questions you had to know the price of drugs you had to understand how you know their culture was and I was very good at that the training that we received in the DEA was very superficial you really learned very little about undercover work your actual education came from being in the field and doing the work and there were times when you made mistakes and you had to recover very quickly and again paint a very convincing picture for these individuals but your true teacher was being in in the field
