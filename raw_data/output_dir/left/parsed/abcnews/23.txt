>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
>>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M TERRY MORAN WITH ABC NEWS IN
LONDON AND WE BRING YOU SOME 
BREAKING NEWS.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE INTERRUPTING 
YOUR SPECIAL PROGRAM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CANCELED THE
PLANNED SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREAN
LEADER KIM JONG-UN SCHEDULED FOR
JUNE 12th IN SINGAPORE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AFTER A SERIES 
OF INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS AND 
REALLY A LACK OF CLARITY FROM 
NORTH KOREA ON WHAT THEY WERE 
WILLING TO DO HAS DECIDED TO 
CANCEL THE SUMMIT HE CLEARLY 
LOOKED FORWARD TO.
HE ISSUED A STATEMENT, A LETTER 
HE WROTE TO KIM JONG-UN.
WORTH LISTENING TO EXTRAORDINARY
LINES HERE.
WRITING, KIM, I WAS VERY MUCH 
LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING THERE 
WITH YOU.
SADLY, BASED ON THE TREMENDOUS 
ANGER AND OPEN HOSTILITY 
DISPLAYED IN YOUR MOST RECENT 
STATEMENT, I FEEL IT IS 
INAPPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME TO 
HAVE THIS LONG PLANNED MEETING.
HE ALSO SAYS THAT THE WARNINGS 
NORTH KOREA HAVE ISSUED ABOUT 
THEIR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES, HE 
SAYS, OURS ARE SO MASSIVE AND 
POWERFUL, I PRAY TO GOD WE NEVER
HAVE TO USE THEM.
HE ALSO SAYS, I FELT A WONDERFUL
DIALOGUE WAS BUILDING UP BETWEEN
YOU AND ME, AND HE HOLDS OUT THE
HOPE THEY WILL MEET SOME DAY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP CANCELING TODAY,
THE PLANNED SUMMIT BETWEEN HIM 
AND NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM 
JONG-UN.
WE'LL HAVE MORE COVERAGE 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
WE RETURN YOU TO YOUR LOCAL 
PROGRAMMING.
ON THE WEST COAST, THAT'S "GMA."
I'M TERRY MORAN IN LONDON.
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH 
US
