joining our discussion now Harry Lippmann former federal prosecutor and Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Clinton also with us Ruth Marcus deputy editorial page editor and columnist at the Washington Post and Jonathan Capehart opinion writer for The Washington Post and an MSNBC contributor and Harry I want to go to the last point first which is you have a lawyer standing up in court representing to a federal judge that they've had communication with Sean Hannity over the weekend and Sean Hannity said to them that he does not want his name revealed and said to them that he will appeal a judge's ruling to reveal his name and Sean Hannity last night goes on television and says everything that that lawyer said about him in court was a lie what happens next in judge Kimbell woods courtroom with that lawyer who told her that about Sean Hannity yeah you do not want to play poker and Bluff with any judge but especially judge wood and notice Lawrence it doesn't even matter exactly what Hannity told him he stood up in front of the court and made a representation the representation was if she revealed it he would immediately appeal which you can do you can right away stop the music and try to bring it up to the Second Circuit and it turned out he just folded and of course it ruins his credibility with her but much more given the stakes of this case and what's overall going on it's something she could if she doesn't sanction him for nevertheless she will be very very out of sorts with having received a misrepresentation like that Ruth Marcus let's discuss the president's new team of criminal lawyers from the firm of Spears and imes these are people who Donald Trump would attack as Democratic partisan hacks if they were working for the special prosecutor and tonight they're working for him yes and you know what he's lucky that they're working for him because he has gotten at least wallet lasts what he's long need which is serious criminal representation from lawyers who have experience in the criminal defense field not just some folks who wandered in who have a Supreme Court practice like Jay Sekulow or spend a lot of time on Fox News or something else you need he is I don't know if he's in serious criminal trouble but he is in the middle of a serious criminal investigation and you don't want to be hiring lawyers from TV to do that you want to be hiring these kind of lawyers so Jonathan Capehart when John went when Donald Trump recognizes that he's in very serious legal trouble and he has a very serious legal matter on his hands he seems to behave the same way Robert Muller does with a serious legal matter on his hand and reach out to hire the same kinds of people yeah the best most qualified people who will as route said give him the best representation that he needs and he could possibly have and hasn't had since we've been talking about the the special counsel Muller and this investigation and and Harry the the president of course I'm sure does not know that the leaders of the law firm that he has hired wrote that letter to rod Rosen Stein calling for a special prosecutor what do you imagine his reaction will be to that and and what should his reaction be to that his reaction should be exactly what Ruth said that it doesn't matter that he is and what you said at the top warrants it doesn't matter he has solid professional counsel they will reckon they will represent him absolutely vigorously without regard what will his response be I you know I think possibly his head will turn around 360 degrees you know when congest just imagine what you know what he's what he's thinking given his worldview and way of approaching these things and Ruth Marcus Fox News has said they've discussed this situation with Sean Hannity about Michael Cohen and that that they see no problem going forward they they didn't know anything about it for they learned about it when everyone else learned about it in court and of course they don't see a problem what what problem could there possibly be I am being sarcastic here of course there's a problem it's unbelievable when you get on television and you rail about this raid of a lawyer's office and you don't mention your own continuing relationship with him this is a problem it will be a problem in my office and it would be a problem I think at MSNBC in your office it's simply not a problem for Fox News but there's something different about Fox News I want to go back and say one thing if I might about the president's potential response to this letter calling for the appointment of a special counsel this is we know from Donald Trump's tweets and everything else the way he thinks he is just a tribalist you are on his team were you on the other team you are a friend who you are an enemy so he doesn't understand that lawyers can compartmentalize that first of all just because your law partners have signed this letter or the heads of your law firm even have signed this letter but he doesn't understand that doesn't that you might not necessarily agree with that he doesn't understand that you might be a Democrat somebody who has given to Democratic candidates and also be a lawyer who could go after Democrats as well as Republicans because that's what prosecutors do they want scalps they don't want to go for their team this is just completely inconsistent with the way Donald Trump thinks and that is why harry said his head might spend around 360 degrees I think it might just explode fun Jonathan there's a report tonight saying that the president is apoplectic about this investigation in the Southern District and one thing he absolutely does not believe is that the professional prosecutors involved will use the division of labor that is a setup for this to make sure that the prosecutors handling the Cohen case do not see any of the privileged communication that might exist in some of the harvest of the rain the President does not believe that those lawyers will ethically carry that out he is employing tonight as his defense counsel lawyers who have been involved in the Southern District of New York in that very same unit doing that very same thing yeah Lawrence this is ridiculous about this look there are a couple of things about Donald Trump and I would have make a bet with you right now Lawrence how much you want to bet that even if he discuss um brave soul goes up to the residents of Dannemora logo it tells him what you just reported I bet you he doesn't say anything for two reasons one Donald Trump is all about Donald Trump he will defend himself and it doesn't depress he doesn't matter his own livelihood and well-being is what matters one two as you reported it in your opening in your opening monologue there the RNC and correct me if I'm wrong the RNC our campaign donations are paying for these lawyers so when the president finds himself and feels personally in trouble and can finally get league excellent legal representation that is paid for by someone else not by him that this is why we see Spears and iams at the table here and why he's probably not going to say word boo about those two people signing that letter of you know former prosecutors who called for a special counsel that's my bet to you learn all right I will bet you a one cup of coffee on that Harry Lippmann Jonathan Kaye
