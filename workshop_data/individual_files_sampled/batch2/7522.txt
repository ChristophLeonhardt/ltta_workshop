you know what I'm saying welcome a young turks is that translated into english jancuga the lovely and brilliant ana kasparian hi hey how you doing good I like the color matching of your hair to the dress does my hair match my dress no no it's just a nice combo oh it's a nice combo I'm actually kind of matching you you're wearing a puncture yeah that's true I hadn't thought of that okay so now that we've got the most important part of the show out of the way I tonight's election night heavyweight match Andrew Cuomo V Cynthia Nixon there are there's also several other just Democrats that are on the line there's effort each out she's running for attorney general she's not a just Democrat because that's not a position that just Democrats endorses em but obviously super progressive so that is all coming up at 8:05 Eastern tonight John and Rolla Jimmy Dore will join us furthermore we're gonna do a number of fun things we're gonna show you the super Turks that's super fun i we I hope we have time to cover a story that was written about us mmm a little bit of drums okay so lots of madness on tonight's election show that's coming up in a couple hours first to grab the Young Turks on this show I mean do I have to bother telling you that Donald Trump has said something stupid I mean and we move forward anyways but speaking of elections I want to do one thing quickly so last night we went off the air because the Lieutenant Governor race had not been called yet and it was really close there was 91 percent reporting and that last nine percent did not come in for hours and hours and hours so I wanted to just if you missed the rhode island results last night i give you a quick summary here first of all in the governor's race there was a wonderful just epigram Brown he he did not wind up winning he was up against an incumbent Democrat that's obviously a much much harder race and Gina Raimondo won 57.2 to Matt Browns 33.5% but uh that's a good showing for Matt Brown obviously we wish he'd have pulled it off now the lieutenant governor's race that was hanging in the balance when we last left you wind up resulting in about the same place when we left air last night Daniel McKee did pull it off 51.1% it Erin Reagan Burke's 48.9 Regan Berg was adjusted Democrat he'd been leading earlier in the night so that went back and forth back and forth that's why you shouldn't miss any of our live election coverage is there was a lot of drama there t y-t-dot-com /live obviously to watch all of those the last primaries tonight in New York and then the general election on November 6 is going to be a bonanza / bananas we are going to have an extravaganza here at the Young Turks now real quick two other irrelevant races because they're fun the US Senate race on the Republican side in Rhode Island was 87 point 7 percent - Robert Flanders obviously brother of Ned but why do I bring that up because he was up against rocky delle Fuente and if you watched our election coverage 'as rocky belif one day somehow has managed to be on the ballot in at least half a dozen states almost every election night we're like wait what's rocky della 4n doing here and he popped up in Rhode Island and grabbed twelve point three percent of the vote it's kind of amazing combined he might have gotten more votes in this election cycle than anyone in all the different races he ran and then finally a super random US Representative District one on the Republican side Patrick Donovan got seventy eight point four percent so why am I telling you this random Republican race because it was opponent Frederick Wysocki mmm there's an Erin why sake was the commander of the armies of the east for the Young Turks and I just noted that his uncle unfortunately lost that race okay it's not his actual uncle but that was fun super random that's all now you know what happened in Rhode Island unfortunately no big wins for progressives or just Democrats but that's life in the big city although there was a congressional race where a more conservative corporate Democrat lost we'll take every Tues where we're gonna get him okay Casper what's next all right there is a bombshell report involving Brent Kavanagh the Supreme Court nominee and it is quite a doozy we don't know too many details about these allegations but it turns out that some Senate Democrats have come across some concerning information and would like to postpone the vote confirming him as a Supreme Court justice so this all started with Dianne Feinstein she essentially let everyone know that someone came to her and said that this individual was the victim of sexual misconduct and the person who committed that alleged sexual misconduct was Brett Kavanaugh and so as a result Democrats in the Senate would like to review more of this information Dianne Feinstein says as she has forwarded this information to the FBI for further investigation so let me give you her exact quote on this she says I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court that individual strongly requested confidentiality declined to come forward or press the matter further and I have honored that decision I have however refer the matter to federal investigative authorities meaning the FBI so we again don't know too much about this because they haven't released any real detail into this alleged sexual misconduct but here is the little tiny bit that we do know to officials briefed on the letter's contents told the New York Times the allegations relate to a possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and an unidentified woman when they were both in high school Kavanaugh is in his 50s he's 53 yeah so look back when I was a Republican I believe some conspiracy theories and I thought that maybe they had brought in Anita Hill to try to make sure Clarence Thomas didn't when boy I was totally wrong about that and so Anita Hill of course was incredibly real and her allegations were real and then obviously the country back then was split on whether her allegations were enough to derail Clarence Thomas's you know nomination to the Supreme Court in this so I give you that as context because senators don't make things up they're not gonna risk their careers to make things up so this person went to a US congressman congresswoman in California first and that person took at the Dianne Feinstein now does that mean that the person is telling the truth we don't even know who she is we have no idea right but this is real so that's point one they have a real person saying there was this sexual assault a long long time ago okay now the woman does not want to come forward with a real name at all and she's apparently very very clear about that so if she never comes forward I don't know what you make of that I don't know if the FBI can figure out you know what to do about this and a short period of time as they've delayed the confirmation hearings for a while now and I tell you all of that because of course the Republicans are going to say oh it's a dirty trick by the Democrats at cetera and the Republicans would know a thing or two about dirty tricks to delay confirmation proceedings so they live in a glass house on that one now substantively this happened in high school so it would have to be a very very serious charge for I think in my opinion to affect the confirmation proceedings now look I think that Cavanaugh is would be a terrible justice I'm 100 percent opposed to him on a great number of issues including his views on women's rights and his views on citizens united he's Pro corruption and I think it's unacceptable but and this charges might be you know I don't know if it's theirs they've used different words one phrase was sexual misconduct the charges might be serious enough so I'm not prejudging that at all because I have no idea what they are but if you're going back to high school I think they have to be more and more and more serious he's a 53 year old man now so that's my opinion with the very little facts that we have so far yeah I mean it's hard to have an opinion with very little facts it on one hand you know if someone came to me if I were a u.s. senator and someone came to me and confided in me that he or she had been the victim of sexual misconduct and this Supreme Court nominee could be confirmed and and then serve as a Supreme Court justice I would be concerned I think I would probably handle it the same way that senator Feinstein handled it but it is difficult to have an opinion on it because we don't know anything about this misconduct we don't know if you know he had sexually assaulted someone we don't know if he was sexually harassing a student we know that he went to an all-boys school so I don't know you know in what environment in what context of this alleged we don't know anything we don't know anything it's just it's hard to come out with a strong opinion and I think that's fine but at the same time you know for the woman who did come forward I understand why she wouldn't want to be identified because we know how incredibly cruel and and just terrible it is for women who come forward and allege any type of sexual misconduct they immediately become the enemy and especially when politics is involved it gets even worse I mean we saw what happened to Anita Hill we're living in an even worse Society when it comes to that issue if you ask me yeah in a lot of ways we've gone backwards so Anita Hill was viciously attacked at the time but that was pre all right pre trolls pre Trumpy era and so things were bad back then but there is a particular witness today so no one can blame the woman for and let me be clear I went to an all-boys school but is an unidentified woman that came forward no one can blame her for being concerned the right-wing might try to portray her as something she's not if she comes forward okay I so that's why I'm telling you and I think that I would like to stand on here on this if he if the allegations were from last year or you know relatively recently then there are more relevantly because they affect his current character who he is as a person right now who who is as a person right now that's exactly right Ana but also how he does on the job how he conduct himself so that conducts himself as a judge those are super relevant the further back you go the more the heart of the standard is if you ask me okay and if people can disagree on that but I mean we're gonna judge people on what they did in high school what what are we considering sexual misconduct I have no idea I have no idea again we don't know what the alleged sexual misconduct is so what if it wasn't actions but it was words all right can anyone withstand that scrutiny I don't know so but I'll leave it at that because we don't know have any more information now but if the proceedings are a little bit delayed as apparently the FBI looks into it and and I think that the FBI maybe they can come to a quick decision because if it goes back about four they can see well is this really serious if it's not really serious I don't think the FBI is gonna say wait I'm gonna conduct a federal investigation on something that happened you know thirty five years ago if it's not that serious right but we'll see so right now the Senate is planning on voting for Kavanagh or voting in regard to Kavanagh on September 20th and Republicans are saying there's absolutely no reason to postpone this or delay this we are planning on going forward as planned but we'll see what happens and by the way a White House spokesperson came forward and blamed all of this on Chuck Schumer as if Chuck Schumer does anything like like it's hilarious because Chuck Schumer is actually not involved in any of this at all other than the fact that he's a Democratic senator a very weak one at that and so I want to give you the statement from Kerry Kubek who released this statement senator schumer promised to oppose judge Kavanaugh nomination with everything I have and it appears he is delivering with this 11th hour attempt to delay his confirmation accept Schumer isn't the person who came forward with the these allegations with this statement like the fact that they're immediately painting it on Schumer makes me think they have something to hide you know it's weird to attack Schumer yeah I don't know if we're really guessing here look these are the Democrats doing research on Kavanagh to try to find something on him of course they are and they should be did they find a woman from high school the Trump administration confirm 20 federal judges he brokered a deal with Mitch McConnell okay to hurry up and confirm 20 federal judges that Trump chose okay and then what does the White House do when there's a little bit of drama with this Cavanaugh thing they come forward and they blame Schumer for it Schumer stopped making deals with Republicans you are so pathetic he's so pathetic and embarrassing it's that's interesting because you know the Democrats are constantly under the belief that no but if we're nice to Republicans they'll be nice back do they look like they're being nice back Chuck okay so that we do know and is a fair point yeah okay we're gonna take a quick break here we've got a lot more coming up so stay right with us we hope you're enjoying this free clip from The Young Turks if you want to get the whole show and more exclusive content while supporting independent media become a member at TYT comm slash joined today in the meantime enjoy this free second all right back on the other turks jenkin ana with you guys we're doing a membership drive we want to check in on it every day try to get to 100,000 it's a preposterous goal but we like to be crazy like that we started at a little over 27,000 let's see where we are now and it's about nine days later at thirty thousand nine hundred thirty-four can i see thirty one thousand by the end of the show can I see thirty one thousand TYT calm slides joined to become a member now part of what we're doing here is sharing with you guys and a lot of you've written some wonderful stuff in here and I want to highlight it and today is Rachel and she has an excellent email that she sent in to us so she wrote in I started watching the Arcturus in 2010 when I was 13 years old I'm Canadian so a lot of my knowledge of the USA came from TYT over the years I relied on TYT for honest news as I became an aware teenager and then a voting citizen and now an adult not once in the past eight years have I ever doubted TYT I've admired your integrity to admit when you're wrong but overwhelming the report the news in a way that is honest but also relatable that didn't make me feel dumb for being young with opinions I don't know how to send this message but particularly I wanted to send a thank you to Ana growing up with a TYT growing up with TYT seeing a strong woman arguing or opinions without buckling to anyone around her was incredibly powerful I would thank Ana for my unwillingness to buckle when a conservative bro tries to talk me down in a poli-sci class I finally became a TYT member today so I I want to thank her and you know she watched for eight years he remains the loyal fan and she's enjoying now all the shows of course but that was a powerful message yeah it was Thank You Rachel that meant a lot to me and look you know who was a young person with opinions at TYT me when I started I was like I think nineteen about to turn 20 when I started TYT and I had strong opinions early on and I never felt stupid for having opinions here so I was oftentimes wrong I remember one of the first debates that we had was on whether or not it made sense to legalize prostitution I don't even know if you remember that but I was anti legalizing prostitution engage in a debate with Jenko on that and I was wrong and it was it was a good learning experience some debates as well throughout this right and and obviously when I was young I was a Republican and changed my ways as well look that's what we're trying to do here foster an environment where we could all learn together grow together and so Rachel the fact that you were part of that for eight years is fantastic that's the main reason why we do this show and and we said one last thing I was out for dinner the other day and the woman was aren't running the cash register was a TYT viewer - she's also around 19 20 years old going to college around here and she wanted to say mention to me specifically to say how much she admires ana and I gotta tell you I am super proud of that that you have become a role model for strong women yeah I mean I never expected to but it's like I don't think the women who feel that way realize how much they keep me going because this job is insanely difficult and there are moments where you're just like I don't know if I can keep going and just when I feel like I'm hitting rock bottom and I can't keep going forward I'll get messages like that from women specifically and thank you and and that's not to say that I don't get the love from our male viewers as well I appreciate that as well but I think it's in the political world there's something extra when it comes to being a woman yeah and looked at our best that's when we support you guys you support us back and when we got each other's back and and and I'm proud of that and I love that you guys were taking part in that so thank you and so as you know we told you the membership drive is to build a home and progressive so let's do it together TYT calm slice join to make that happen now I read all that but I got to read you two quick comments from today because they're great house and wrote in I'm a new member as well very excited to be here love to listen to your sanity thank you jane vx-3 said i'm so eager to see the primary coverage thank you guys for covering all these amazing races I voted absentee for Cynthia and all the progressive candidates running in my area thank you guys for giving a platform to these amazing candidates I voted for for every election since 2016 primary seriously posters started calling my cell phone number since I'm now a quote-unquote likely voter I would never have heard of Alexandria Cascio Cortez Zephyr Teachout Oranje Monty Williams without you guys Thank You Jane really really appreciate it again that's us hopefully at our best and and building a progressive movement together and I just love that that's what we do for a living all right more news for you guys all right Paul Manafort we'll take a plea deal in fact he is cooperating with special counsel Robert Muller and this is right before his second trial is set to begin now we have done some pretty extensive coverage on his first trial which did result in eight convictions for fraud and for failing to register as a foreign agent and so we don't know exactly what this plea deal contains at the moment we don't know how he plans on cooperating with Muller but what we do know so far is that the deal is expected to be announced in court tomorrow Friday and it remains unclear whether Manta Ford has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors or simply conceding to a guilty plea which would allow him to avoid the stress and the expense of another trial so if you are excited about this news just hold because again we don't know if this is just him saying all right I'm guilty let's just get on with it or if he's actually planning to really cooperate in this special investigation so you know you got killed convicted on eight counts earlier so facing a maximum of 80 years but in reality he's more likely to get about seven years why do you know why I don't it's because he's rich powerful cooperate at all I mean usually that happens when you take a plea deal don't shorten the sentence he did not cooperate and he was convicted of eight charges he's supposed to get you know somewhere around 80 years he gets seven years I don't know it just seems you know strange I kid around because he's rich and powerful but I'm barely kidding because if you're poor and you were facing 80 years you might get seventy so no you might get eighty right get eighty you went to trial that's right and so so the details of that are a different situation than the news of today and but if he's actually facing only about seventeen does a plea deal and on the second set of charges and gets a couple years more out of that he might actually make it out alive because the thought was he he by see sixty nine years old he might serve the rest of his life in prison so that's why he might have done the deal without necessarily giving evidence on Trump he spent only four hours with prosecutors in the deal that might or might not mean anything four hours might seem like a lot but if they were getting a ream of information about collusion with Russia would likely take longer but it might be the first meeting and there might be meetings afterwards so and we might be able to tell them this is breaking right now right as we're live on the air we might be able to tell based on the sweaty tweets that Trump's ends tonight ya know but yes you're absolutely right about that but this is my analysis speculation whatever you want to call it this is my read of what's going on look I think that if manna Ford does have dirt on Trump but decided no I'm not gonna cooperate he's made that decision because he knows that Trump has no problem pardoning whomever he pleases but that's if he has the power to pardon people Trump has become even more unhinged he's starting to lose even more allies talks of impeachment have become I guess more serious I mean especially after the Woodward book and that anonymous op-ed I think there's a possibility that Manafort sees this situation as dire and realizes oh there's a possibility that Trump might not be able to pardon me well so that cuts two ways he might have wanted to take the plea deal right away so that he can get a pardon right away well Trump still in office so that's another possibility look I wasn't convinced that Manta Ford had anything on Trump in the first place until Trump went ballistic after his conviction and so that led me to believe and started immediately talking about pardon pardon could be party could be pardoned now could be pardoned later compartment anytime I want yeah I was like okay he's got something on him that's clear so whether he turned that over today is unclear and and only Muller and Manta fort know for now but at least that chance has increased and Anna's right it could be cut the other way that if he thinks not only impeachment but my god it turns out his cabin is talking about the 25th amendment that they might rule a mentally incompetent to to be president at then he might be thinking well oh well I don't have time because Giuliani said hey after the whole investigation Muller investigation is over then we might pardon them but Trump might not be in office by then so too hard to tell right now the meetings are closed doors but it is big news that he has decided to take a guilty plea here because it certainly increases the chances that he's cooperating with prosecutors and giving them relevant information all right let's move on to Puerto Rico because there are some updates to that story Donald Trump does not believe the official death toll of Puerto Ricans following Hurricane Maria and we know that because of an asinine tweet that he put out there just today he says 3,000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico when I left the island after the storm had hit they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths as time went by it did not go up by much how do you know how do you know you haven't been concerned about it not aware anyway then a long time later they started to report really large numbers like 3,000 okay so as we have reported here at the Young Turks George Washington University went in and did the research and the analysis necessary to find more accurate numbers because more than 64 people had obviously died in the her math of Hurricane Maria and they found that 2975 people had died and they had died for a number of reasons the investigation looked at the total number of deaths from September 2017 through February 2018 and compared it with typical death rates adjusting for many variables including the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans who evacuated the territory after the storm struck on September 20th so why did so many people die in the aftermath well it was because of a number of reasons including the widespread and lengthy power outages a lack of access to adequate health care water insecurity and then diseases related to the crisis so there were a number of problems many of which FEMA did admit to at when they did an after you know after they released a report about their failures and some of the issues involving their relief efforts but Trump is in you know Long Island thinking that everything that he did was absolutely perfect and only what does he really think that only six to 18 people died yes so look when he says when he first went to the island they were saying that a lower number of people died that's true and for a long time they were saying that 64 people had died in the storm that's also true that for a long time they were saying that so what was the difference it's the report that Ana explained to you guys so if you're president and you're responsible for all the people in this country yes including Puerto Rico well you would care to get it right and understand why they increase the number and why those people died in the first place because when you look into that the answer is even more tragic than if they had died on the day of the storm so a lot of those deaths were preventable electricity goes out and then they don't have the adequate health care to and and they die because a lot of folks need electricity for their health care the in the hospitals etc more importantly into isolated homes where they're taking care of themselves so there's so many of that of those deaths were preventable it like well I mean there's a big storm pull Ryan today saying like I mean it's a big storm we're gonna get to Ryan in just a second yeah but sorry to jump in I just I can't help but do it like Trump has this way and I don't think a lot of people realize it where he will both deny while simultaneously making excuses so which one is it so he'll deny that they did a horrible job in Puerto Rico da we did a great job everything was wonderful in Puerto Rico a plus our efforts in Puerto Rico were even better than our efforts in Texas in Florida okay he'll say that but in the same statement he'll also say things about how Oh Puerto Rico's power grid was really bad and you know it's an island and it's surrounded by big water okay so if you did such a great job why are you now listing all of your excuses for why you did a horrible job yeah well and then the second tweet that he sent this morning goes to that and he has no sense right any normal president would even if they were gonna say hey listen 3,000 people died later I'm a little scared they would frame it in a an enormous leap point way respectful of the people who did die it said of course not gonna do any of that but then he goes into delusional paranoia he continues in the in that series of tweets by saying this was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico if a person died for any reason like old age just add them onto the list bad politics I love Puerto Rico he's so pathetic he's so pathetic well you don't need any help making yourself look bad trust me Democrats don't have to you know lift a finger to make you look bad but I mean it must it must be a wonderful existence to be that delusional about who you are as a person and to think that you're that fantastic while you're a complete and utter failure not just now as president but throughout your entire life yeah well you know it's of course the deep insecurity here at night he doesn't think that he wakes up in a cold sweat e panic about what a failure and loser he is every single day that's the one solace I take and and that's why he'll do those crazy tweets either in the early or in the middle of the night and but nothing is ever his fault he look remember the famous saying about the White House the buck stops here Harry Truman said that drop is the exact opposite fuck stop something over there the Puerto Ricans they were lazy he said he talked about how they didn't prepare enough you didn't prepare enough lazy who never prepared for anything there's been a thousand stories about how you won't even read one page to prepare for incredibly important meetings you have no idea what's going on the nerve of this guy to insinuate that anybody else is lazy but he's got to blame other people who did who messed that I lose the democrats the democrats are trying to blame me the people actually died or did they not there everyone acknowledges yes they died the report says it's because they were not getting to care after the storm if it were not for the storm they would not have died everyone else on the planet agrees to that including FEMA and and B why because they're actually being rational and saying hey I want to make sure I get it right so when the storm hits North Carolina and South Carolina today that I don't make the same mistakes that's because they care and look that's under the Trump administration but they're doing a good job but their Trump at the top is like no who's the Democrats it was two Puerto Ricans I don't know just do homework Oh works annoying I don't have to prepare Bernie I give myself an A plus no he's been preparing for everything his whole life just like he did with North Korea another issue that he bungled okay so uh Trump is so ridiculous with his handling of Puerto Rico and his response to criticism of how he handled it that even some Republicans are pushing back against him now Republicans are afraid of Donald Trump so they're doing so in the weakest way imaginable and I want to give you one example here's Paul Ryan talking about the Puerto Rican death toll he says only six to 15 people died you've been to Puerto Rico and the aftermath in that storm what do you think casualties don't make a person look bad that's not so I have no reason to dispute these numbers I was in Puerto Rico after the hurricane it was devastated this was a horrible storm I toured the entire island and it was it's a it's an isolated island that lost its infrastructure owners power for a long time you couldn't get two people for a long time on the island because road were washed out power was gone and and the casualties mounted for a long time so I have no reason to dispute those numbers those are just the facts of what happens when a horrible hurricane hits an isolated place like an island okay No the death toll does make someone look bad because it could have been easily avoided kind of like how it was avoided in Florida and in Texas it was because there was much more attention paid to those states as opposed to Puerto Rico look like you said it's an island it is also pathetic yeah what we don't have ships we can't reach an island we don't have planes we spent an insane amount of money on our military so we can have the best the most updated you know capabilities our ships are you know our Air Force has the best Jets and the best plays the best everything so we where's that money going we can't use some of that money to help with relief efforts for US citizens and by the way Rick Scott is another Republican politician he's running for Senate in the state of Florida he's another one who kind of pushed back against Trump but did so in an insanely weak way he says I disagree with POTUS an independent study said thousands were lost and governor Rosello agreed we'll get to result in just a minute I've been to Puerto Rico seven times and saw devastation firsthand yada-yada okay Rick Scott is realizing that he needs to distance himself from Trump because guess where Puerto Ricans fled to to Florida yeah so rick Scott is totally disingenuous he's a horrible person he's never cared about Latinos before and and now that there's 1.2 million Puerto Ricans voting in Florida and he is running for Senate seat in Florida he's a Oh me I like you I love Puerto Ricans I think what happened to Puerto Rico is an outrage I'm a might everybody knows how much I care about minorities get the hell out of here rick Scott you bragged about crushing minorities before with your you know the all we're tough guys in Florida we're gonna do stand your ground and then we're gonna do all that stuff we're gonna and if anybody gets in our way and all this stuff now all of a sudden oh hey the voting electorate in Florida shifted a little bit oh my god did you see what happened to Puerto Rico I care so much Oh spare me you're such a fake phony politician yeah Puerto Ricans are now a key voting bloc 1.2 million Puerto Ricans fled from Puerto Rico to Florida that's why Rick Scott is pushing back against Trump a little bit all right so there's one other aspect of the story that I want to get to following Trump's denial of the official death toll in Puerto Rico following the storm hurricane Maria the Governor of Puerto Rico actually pushed back against him which is odd because he initially cooperated with Trump and agreed with him on everything let's hear what he has to say now how can we be as the United States how can we be the standard-bearer of democracy in the world if we don't value democracy in our own backyard how can we have over 3 million US citizens that don't have the right to vote that are disenfranchised today after the storm it is evident then the treatment that was given saying Florida or in Texas was very different than the treatment even in Puerto Rico that's interesting it's very different from what he had said previously but I want you to jump in Jake before I provide evidence of that yeah so if the best-case scenario for the governor is well look I was being nice to trump because I we wanted federal help at that time and you know the guy's an orange baby and not he didn't say any of this by the way this is his defense if you were going to make one for him and and if you you know if you criticize him in any way or ask for help too aggressively as the mayor of San Juan did then he'll hate you forever call you nasty and then not give you anything what does it turned out he didn't help much anyway so now he's turning around my guess as to why the government is turning around is he probably saw poll numbers in Puerto Rico and they hate Donald Trump and he said Oh me me being nice is Donald Trump I meant I drove Donald Trump didn't help us enough well that's a little bit late there brother yeah well part of the problem with you know the official death toll was that there were politicians in Puerto Rico that weren't pushing enough to get the number updated the number was at 64 until fairly recently and by the way I just if you don't know who Donald Trump is by now then I worry about you because it shows an insane lack of judgment right because he shown us who he is it's time that people actually believe who he is so with that said here's how he treated Donald Trump and his efforts in Puerto Rico previously I'm gonna go to video four so I'm skipping ahead but this is from October of 2017 here is Governor Ricardo Rosella I give ourselves a ten we have provided so much so fast we were actually there before the storm hit I would give a ten I think we did a fantastic job and we've been giving credit we have done a really great job but I think our response was better than anyone has ever seen did the United States did our government when we came in did we do a great job military first responders FEMA did we do a great job you responded immediately sir and you did some you know Tom and Brock they have been on the phone with me essentially every every day that's so embarrassing yes so many ways but there's more I want to go to the next video just to show you how Trump will use your statements against you he's not even from my party and he started right at the beginning appreciating what what we did and he was tremendously supportive and to governor I just want to tell you that right from the beginning this governor did not play politics he didn't play it at all he was saying it like it was and he was giving us the highest grades I also want to thank your congresswoman so congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez cologne who I've watched the other day and she was saying such nice things about all of the people that have worked so hard Jennifer do you think you could say a little bit what you said about us today and it's not about me okay he thinks by the way as we stated earlier in the show that the Democrats somehow invented the number of people killed to blame him yeah they actually died its mayor of San why I keep saying hey it's not about you can you just respect the dead for one second if you notice in the first video he's like when our government the United States came in Puerto Rico's part of the United States but ok let's assume he meant the federal government and move on everybody's giving us a ten in the second video he was good from the beginning he give us the highest grades it's not about you there was a hurricane all these people died and more were dying as you were bragging about your score of 10 because you are getting them the help that they needed and that's why so many people died but he's he's such a narcissist he can't think of anything but himself look the reason why this is such a big deal is not only were lives lost that didn't need to be lost but it shows you you know his lack of taking responsibility and also like learning from past mistakes and readjusting moving forward is particularly important to learn lessons from past failures when it comes to hurricane relief when you have deadly hurricanes happening on a yearly basis because of extreme weather conditions I know that he's in denial about climate change I know that there's a whole political party in this country who keeps pretending that they don't believe in climate change but it's happening and it's certainly contributing to severe weather conditions it's exacerbating hurricane seasons and we need to learn from that we need to do something to not only mitigate that but make sure that we're ready when these types of hurricanes strike and if you have a president who thinks that he's fantastic at everything he does and refuses to take responsibility for his failures how is he gonna act moving forward so finally why did Rosello turn around and now tweek Donald Trump I don't mean there was criticism was significant you wanna see significant criticism let's go to graphic 21 here's San Juan Mayor Carmen Kruse simply put responding Donald Trump's tweets that we read earlier in the program delusional paranoid and unhinged from any sense of reality Trump is so vain he thinks is about him no it is not and she went on to say your lack of respect is appalling so when you saw the governor earlier that was it's not a very strong response but the fact that he's even criticizing Trump at all why 80% of Puerto Ricans polled said that they were disappointed in how Trump handled the hurricane I don't know who the other 20% are but but if you're trying to win reelection in Puerto Rico you might not want to go against 80 percent of the people there we got to take a break yes so there's a couple of amazing stories left of course and one is about how Donald Trump wanted to illegally discriminate against the disabled actively and a person who was involved in that process speaks out it really goes to his character that's an amazing amazing story and then we have a story where that's partly about us and it's not about us Jake it's not about us okay well that one actually kind of is about us but what did we have this what did this Muslim kid do after watching The Young Turks Reuters wrote about it it's fascinating I don't think you want to miss it we'll come right back and tell you
