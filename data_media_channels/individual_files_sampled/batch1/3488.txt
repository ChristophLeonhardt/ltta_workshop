it's a very simple mission and vision to be the world's leading mainstream lifestyle brand for adults with no one in clear second place when he founded the company in the late 50s he founded it as a mainstream lifestyle brand what was clear to me early on was we need to get back to those roots I first met Cooper when he was recently turned 18 he was in college a couple years later we launched a rebranding project and Cooper volunteered to get deeply involved in that even though he was still a full-time in college he began working directly for me as a brand ambassador he's represented us on every continent with the exception of Australia he travels extensively so Cooper's already having an impact on the business side perhaps more importantly is the quiet influence that he brings in terms of connecting the company to his dad's earlier vision I think that I wanted to be involved when I was younger then I got older and I saw what everyone else my age saw which was the girls next door you know this blonde hair sort of big boobed girl that had somehow become the definition of what it was to be playmate and I was sitting there thinking that the whole notion of the saying the girl next door is like the prettiest girl in school the approachable girl for me to be my father's son sitting and looking at what the brand was representing and think how did we sort of come so far from that was I think a big moment for me we are still blocked by a lot of corporate firewalls we still aren't easy to search on Google and so in some ways we're held to a higher standard of being a mainstream lifestyle brand than other brands when people imply that you know the brand only features nude girls and and that's all it is if you actually believe that you know we don't publish good writing or you think that that's sort of all the brain represents and the people who have then passed those judgments have probably never opened up the magazine today's consumers 18 to 34 s have so many sources of information they have such a detector for anything that's not authentic and so having Cooper sitting by my side and helping me have it more insight into that audience is has been critical in some of our transformation
