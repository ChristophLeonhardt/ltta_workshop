hey this is John Cardillo I'm here today for Ezra Levant and this is battle ground so if you don't know this is how battle ground works and it's really cool I'm really excited to be sitting in Fresno today here on battle ground I'm gonna talk about a couple of topics so I'm gonna store up in North Korea big news Donald Trump is backing out of the summit but we want your comments in Chi Braun just commented hi Kai we want to talk about what you want to talk about as much as what I want to talk about so feel free throw your comments out there we're gonna have a lot of fun this next hour and hopefully we're gonna go through some really cool important information so you've seen obviously that President Trump has pulled out of the summit pretty remarkable remarkable stuff I was reading the president's letter to Kim jong-un in North Korea the president basically told him hey don't insult the vice president I mean I'm paraphrasing Donald Trump well hi guys hi MS Li L and rogue Jen there you are please proceed I'm glad you here well Wow and somebody from Brazil we have hey Craig how are you man but this was a big deal the president of the United States basically told Kim jong-un without saying it don't insult my vice president don't insult the United States people by insulting the office of the vice president right you insult the United States and by the way well rocket man don't go threatening us with nukes because our nuclear arsenal is much bigger than yours Louis what does my purple bracelet mean great great question it's for a very rare form of cancer leiomyosarcoma and it's an awareness bracelet for that type of cancer rare cancer does not get a lot of money in research but a high fatality rate but thanks for asking about that glad you noticed it the is very very interesting what with President Trump is doing here it's a new form of diplomacy hi Jane yeah I love man really cool place I google places like that all the time and I just I love tell you guys what I love I love saying how international our audience is it's really very cool for me because of my radio career and things I've done in the past media wise it's always been I've always been a domestic guy here in the US and it's been one of the best parts about working with the rebel has been having this international audience all right so cyanide junkie what happens when Muller denies full disclosure and is forced to drop charges of the Russian company from cyanide junkie now but I think cyanide junkie means and you know what he's right let's move on to Muller because that's a little more interesting in North Korea Trump's out of the North Korea's summit and we'll talk about that a little bit more but it's a great question about Robert Muller so if mower doesn't fully disclose his exculpatory evidence and exculpatory evidence is evidence beneficial to the defense if it's found to be that he didn't disclose that to general Flint's lawyers Paul Mann affords lawyers rickets lawyers even the lawyers of those Russian entities we don't even know if they're real then properly procedurally what ought to happen is the judge should either dismiss charges sanction Muller's team things of that nature will that happen well we will see we'll see Logan's warning is saying hi John it's time for Westerners to face the fact that we cannot coexist with Islam it needs to be re-evaluated and stripped of religious status and it's you know that's been a very interesting debate as we know what is religion it's a philosophical debate and remember by the way here on battleground if you donate a couple of bucks to the rebel we can either ping your tweet your a comment I'm sorry highlight your comment um though I'm on Twitter so often I think everything's tweet we can pin your comment we can highlight your comment so feel so inclined throw us a donation we'd always appreciate it but it is an interesting discussion about Islam isn't it what constitutes our religion if any group commits violence upon violence upon violence where does their religious status end and their designation as an organized criminal enterprise or a terror enterprise begin and I would I'll save this because I'm certainly not going to be able to answer that question in the hour that we're here on air that is definitely a conversation I wish more politicians around the world would have and miss lo Pegg says she loves the fact that the rebel is worldwide i I do too I do to us how do I pronounce this chachi asked if I'm from Oh doesn't somebody else that they're from sorry I John has rebel explored the possibility that Bill Nye the ice-cream guy his face any charges for grooming kids well I don't know if don't lie the science guy has if there's any evidence that he's ever done anything with kids outside of some internet conspiracy theories so let's not go there Logan's warning my pleasure to answer the question for you I love going at these topics by the way you guys are really posing your messages are coming up quick and furiously I love it and you guys are posing some very very interesting question this is really really cool so I really appreciate that Alexandra Matheson says Islam is a cult not a religion death for apostolic isn't religion well you know a lot of people feel that way and a lot of people feel that certain sects of Islam or they do mirror cult-like behavior more than religious behavior that I would argue that Isis was certainly a cult the Taliban is certainly a cult you know cutting off teachers heads and stoning women for daring three books is that's not very religious to me I the corker hey hi from Nova Scotia as well Nova Scotia is an absolutely beautiful part of the world so hello right back from here and I wish I could say sunny South Florida but horribly overcast South Florida a lot of comments on Islam but this one hits home for me right i mean i was in new york city cop and he you guys know that quick Delvin in my background if you don't know me I host off-the-cuff and the longer show off-the-cuff Declassified on the rebel I was a syndicated radio guy in the u.s. started work when the rebel really loves if they were doing we had some conversations I joined them now about nine months ago and my background was NYPD I was NYPD and worked on a federal task force went into the private sector still chasing bad guys and then did a lot of media work with Fox News Fox Business I do syndicated radio shows actually where my forte was always political analysis with an angle toward national security and law enforcement and it might have guessed it I'm a pretty conservative guy MIT you might have had better take away if you if you've ever listened to my show or see me on any other media and John Lawrence southern asks me John what do you think of Justin Trudeau well I tried to not think of Justin Trudeau I think unfortunately he's the Barack Obama of Canada and I feel for my good friends up in Canada who have to deal with this guy and the way he embarrasses their nation and weakens it defends likes the letter that President Trump said Kim jong-un I love that letter that President Trump sent to Kim jong-un I think it was an incredibly powerful letter that painted the United States of America in a very very good light and I think it paints the United States in a very very good light I think Marxism and Islam a both sent by Satan oh I think all of you might agree with you you know here's the thing what people say moderate Islam moderate Muslims well moderate Muslims to me are not really Muslims because Islam is a religion unlike many of the various silos of Christianity and Judaism where if you're not an inherent Muslim there are other Muslims who want to kill you if I miss church on a Sunday other Catholics don't come to kill me I don't have to be afraid to put on Twitter oops I got what was there late for Easter Mass I don't have to worry about being stoned or my car blown up so there is some credibility to that Gary morally New York cops were great to me another story no Gary tell me the story I want to hear it because please get such a bad rap and I love hearing good stories about police officer Andrea says a NYPD yup I feel that way as well although I feel really sorry for my friends my former co-workers a lot of good friends still on the job in New York they have to work for Bill de Blasio in New York City they have to work for Bill de Blasio and somebody like that I called Justin Trudeau the Barack Obama of Canada well is Andrea Hetherington says there is no such thing as a moderate Muslim Andrea I would tend to agree with you for people who are adherence to Islam not seen any that I would find true moderates Blake runner says Trudeau is a kid in a diaper and a pacifier they can't handle his tantrums that's how we in the States Blake felt about Obama John Christian Andersen says Trudeau is a moronic little girl that destroy Canada again how we in the States us conservatives felt about Barack Obama so thank you very much Jane Nash Catholics and Protestant did kill each other though great point but I think you understand the context in which I'm saying it and that context is that I don't have to be afraid to treat something about my not adhering strictly to Catholicism for fear of being beheaded on the street or having my home blown up by some lunatic okay the corker said John do you think Obama was behind the spying on the Trump campaign absolutely I think what happened here I think the missing link in all of this and when we're gonna find out is that a Barack Obama and John Brennan his CIA director james clapper his Director of National Intelligence began this operation against the Trump campaign they ran an illegal spying operation against US persons on American soil something that's legal CIA most notably but the intelligence community on the whole is not supposed to it's illegal for them to operate on American soil especially against Americans oh yes the corker I absolutely do and I think that's the missing link in all this I think that once the Obama administration realized how badly they had acted they use their Department of Justice under Loretta Lynch their FBI under James Comey to try to cover up for clapper and Brennan in the intelligence community and I think this will shake out to be the greatest political scandal in American history one of the greatest in global history that was an absolutely outstanding question thank you very much for asking it thank you and thank you for the donation by the way okay John it was blown up outside Grand Central Station on 2017 the NYPD was very helpful being a visitor from the UK I'm really glad to hear that the NYPD I helped you out the men and women to the NYPD 35,000 I'm gonna do an amazing job every day thank you very much for thee and God I hope you're okay I hope you're okay I hope your family's okay John Smith Trudeau is a complete failure to Canada thanks to him we are being run over by illegal immigrants Barack Obama did those John that's what he did to us John and it's it's it's sad Andria Hetherington said we had eight years of Obama's sissy pants policy I'm so thankful for Trump and I wasn't even a Republican until Trump I woke the hell up never been happier do you know that I saw some internal numbers Andrea there were 40 percent was 40 percent in some states in some areas 40 percent democratic crossover for Donald Trump yep I Mary is 40 percent of formerly Democrat voters witched the aisle to vote for Donald Trump what's the aisle to vote for Donald Trump and thanks very much for doing it America stronger or it this is um wow you guys are throwing me comments very very quickly I absolutely love it a little bit more on the Obama spying scandal and so now I think that we're learning a lot more about this spy thrown into the Trump campaign this guy Stephon Halper and I think that in and of itself is going to be a great great scandal Donald Trump was tweeting about this he was noting that this guy was paid more money than any other adviser those agencies happy shy del asks did you work at a Fort Apache precinct in the Bronx back in the day no but not far away Fort Apache was the 41st the 4-1 precinct I worked in the for six precinct we were called the Alamo afford Apache was a little bit east of us I was on the west side of the Bronx that was just north of Yankee Stadium both pretty nasty areas and even to this day pretty rough areas the if you saw the president at the law enforcement memorial last week hugging that family of detective Mia sodas Familia who was killed she was actually killed in my old precinct we had mutual friends I didn't know her she was killed on a corner that I worked countless night a very rough area then very rough area today David Newman hello from England hello David from South Florida how are you Gary Oh a natural gas explosion no serious injuries great to hear and again I'm so glad the NYPD to carry a Gary really really appreciate you letting everybody know that it could be proud of my old age Logan's worn it keep up the good work John would love for the opportunity to call in one day tell you what Logan that is something we hear the rebel are talking about I would love to be able to interact that way with the guests and definitely something on the radar because this is so much fun music says John curdled you're great at this format thank you very much in fairness though I was a radio guy before I was a video guy TV guy so this comes pretty natural to me it's and I find this I love there's nothing I love more when I'm on air than engaging with the audience I could do this with you guy I wish we had more than an hour I could do this with you guys for eight hours I love this it's so much fun for me I think all right real men fish first of all I love fishing I spear dive I a scuba dive I spear fish I Lobster one of my favorite comments I think Nancy Pelosi is setting herself up for an insanity plea I couldn't agree more there is definitely something a little off these days about Nancy Pelosi Hillary's best political buddy Jesus is Lord rights Hillary's best political buddy was senator Byrd Robert Byrd of course - senator from West Virginia brenn Wizard of the KKK back in the day she even eulogized at his funeral and the democrats called senator byrd if you don't know this the conscience of the senate even though he had been a senior member of the KKK gary morally is asking what what i think about a statement daughters of these statement I'm not sure Gary who were talking about here sorry something I might have missed so John will you do this more often you're doing a great job oh that is a very very real possibility so you but I want to stay tuned to the rebel ok let's speak about Israel versus Iran Israel is the good guy Iran as the bad guy Iran as the world's worst state sponsor of terror they wanted to carve out a Shia Crescent they work with Hezbollah which is now not only the de facto leadership in in Lebanon but the actual political leadership in Lebanon they would love nothing more than to surround Israel Iran would eventually eradicate Israel with help from their Muslim partners in the region most notably Hezbollah and Hamas and I think that we need to be a friend Israel way we've been we're becoming a great friend Israel again with President Donald Trump his relationship with Netanyahu it is critical it is critical that Western nations galvanize around Israel because if we lose Israel then our other coalition partners fall and I want to point something out how remarkable it is what Donald Trump has pulled off here not only is Israel is the relation with Israel in the United States remedied and getting stronger but coalition partners Muslim nations like Jordan because of the renewed strength of the United States are now seeing Israel as an equal partner in the security coalition in the region and rogue Jen says yeah more John on battleground this is fun right guys this is a good time okay so Gary says the Salsbury UK nerve agent attack Gary I am unfortunately I haven't been following it I'm so inundated with news surrounding Trump and North Korea but I'm gonna it sounds very interesting I'm gonna get on that because I know the story you're talking about now but I have to acknowledge I just have not had a chance to dig into that one I just I haven't we could do Ruby Tuesday says we could do with somebody like Trump 4:00 p.m. here in the UK yes you could yes you could I think every country would do pretty well with a Donald Trump now now wouldn't they art band Allah is saying Israel commits acts of atrocities and others fight their Wars from bended the NPT so Israel could attack Iran through Syria art Israel is allowed to defend itself even Hamas admitted that the 60 or so people killed were Hamas terrorists and Hamas uses women and children and they fake being on crushing crutches the calls a diversion over here while Hamas terror cells try to infiltrate Israel and other places the IDF did a great job my opinion you're talking to a former NYPD guy who lost friends on 9/11 who lived just north of the towers I don't think the IDF Israeli Defense Force killed enough of them you're gonna get no sympathy from me for Hamas or any other terrorist in the world Gary I've got that I'm gonna just saw your comment I'm gonna research that after the show thanks very much Gary for clarifying that for me and it is a the nerve agent story is an interesting interesting story and I'm going to get on that yeah Andrea I agree the weird Iran defenders tend to make me puke as well thank you very very much you know the no stay on Israel is not the aggressor in many cases Israel has been under constant attack since the 1940s and I think they have a right to defend themselves if a vicious gang surrounded your home and tried to kill you and all the surrounding neighborhoods wanted you dead as well well you'd probably be on the defense and you'd probably shoot first and ask questions later now to talk more about Matt Rosendale trying to unseat senator tester in Montana yeah actually we should be talking more about those elections but I do think that's great a great way to segue into something we should have been talking about for the American viewers here on battleground it's the midterm elections remember if you guys donate a couple of bucks your comments gonna pop right out at me on the screen and we can dig deep into it um yeah the midterms here I think the Democrats had delusions of grandeur with a blue wave porker a gotcha I'm gonna be right there the had delusions of grandeur with this with this blue wave I think that the Republicans hold the house I think we pick up seats in the Senate you may lose a couple of seats in the house at this point but congressional polling the generic ballot is showing Republicans up about a point a half that's on the rise the corker John a big Conservative leader Andrew Shearer should state that carbon dioxide is good for the environment it would be controversial but it would be a real curve ball that Trudeau would have to deal with thoughts you know that is very interesting it's something I was reading about the other day normally my show is national security issues but I agree with you there are a new studies showing that it can be beneficial and I think every politician that lies worker to to push a far left radical agenda should be held a task so absolutely absolutely I believe that conservative politicians who don't want to engage in junk science could call every liberal to task whether it be Trudeau whether it be the Barack Obama's the Al Gore's that are still out there I absolutely absolutely do Rhaegar and Rhaegar I'm sorry it's tar gorian hopefully I said your name correctly from putting the kibosh on the summit was a boss move I could not agree more I especially love when he when he jabbed Kim jong-un and he goes a him by the way thanks for those hostages I mean it was a boss move it was a great move at Lauren southern also says carbon dioxide is good for the environment it's really interesting when I read that those reports the other day I spoke to a couple of friends of mine who are college professors one is a botanist and she now works for a county in South Florida all of these issues preservation the Everglades and wetlands and things of that nature estuaries and she's pretty conservative and she said to me it's absolutely good for the environment all this junk science is nonsense and so this is an issue that's gotten me a little more interested so thanks guys for bringing it out Alexander Matheson the Arabs have tried to take over Europe since 500 BC now we're just handing it over cuz they asked nicely the EU is retarded yeah you guys are kind of handing it over I'm sorry man you guys are kind of just uh uh although I have a little bit of faith in Makran and I and I will tell you guys one thing the new US ambassador to Germany Rick Rennell is personal friend of mine and Rick is no pushover well I think you're gonna start seeing a sea change with the way Merkel in Germany Angela start handling some of the issues they were very soft on under Obama Rick is a really good guy and really knows his stuff national security global security centric guy have a lot of faith in him I'm not just saying that plus he's a buddy of mine Iran under the Shah was allied with Israel look this is why Iran and that's from how do I say this best best hind 0:39 I ran into Shah and guys I'm sorry that I'm kind of stifling a little allergies are terrible with his weather change here South Florida it's been terribly overcast pollen is terrible Hicks really bad as well haven't seen a tick season like this in a long time a lot of downed trees I've had to pick my dogs twice to be read it for a ticks and put more medication on them really really bad but Iran um the Shah was friendly to the United States friendly Israel that's why Iran is complex the mullahs Amin Irrawaddy they do not represent the Iranian people and that's what Trump is doing so masterfully he's not lumping them in together so he's he's taking a hard line on the mullahs understanding the population and Iran especially you know those who are in their 20s to 50s remember that are times under the Shah they would lead a little little kid well not there in the 20s but their parents do and he's very careful to you move toward the people of Iran while being hard on the mullahs and I think it is a brilliant a brilliant prodigy make North Africa green again make Greenland green again yeah hey let's make everywhere green again only good things Iran is complicit from Andrea again in the in the disgusting forest happening all over Europe just like Saudi Arabia Iran nuclear deal just gave them the power to extort even more not only the power to extort Andrea great point but the power to do it under the cover of international law you couldn't go in check them out and call them on that who hasn't blonde Iranian oil well you're right Andrea again and that's why Germany sold Iran the binary chemical weapons components that they used in Syria because Germany wanted to play in the Iranian oil game in the Iranian oil game native engine says and soy boys and it will make the world green I couldn't agree more we have a bigger problem here in the US the Boy Scouts of America is no more now its Scouts BSA and they're going to admit girls and we've been girls into the Boy Scout and you know who's most upset about that the Girl Scouts because it's purging its poaching their membership the Girl Scouts are more upset that the Boy Scouts are gonna admit girls than most other people John what are your thoughts on an Tifa I think an Tifa are a bunch of terrorists who should be in handcuffs look I'm a former cop I'm a big proponent a Second Amendment I think if you legally can carry a firearm Harry that firearm I do every day everywhere I'm allowed to legally carry and one of the reason it reasons is the growing threats of violent groups like Antipa they're using weapons they're violent and they are domestic terrorists every bit as much as anybody else horrible horrible human beings Bob Sabater says I did a good job of handling the troll or at Vandelay you know no pun on or its name that's obviously from Seinfeld George Costanza or at Mandalay but I am artful at handling roles what I trained Iranian Air Force and haven't I the f4 phantom that was an awesome plane from the Vietnam days wasn't it now Israel is deploying our f-35 and they're doing some real damage with it I love being that's it's absolutely awesome Rhaegar says I think the Girl Scouts surprisingly will have no boars boys crying to be admitted there no agenda here yeah I think you're right those little boys don't want to go and join the Girl Scouts this is all about you know what this is it is about transgenderism and multiculturalism this is about all of that this is about all of that and it's disgraceful and it's disgusting Andrea says punch back people don't let auntie five drive the narrative exactly Andrea do not let them oh my god this is so random but remember high school I don't know if that's for me but no I mean I do remember high school but not as much as I used to it was a lot of fun as a matter of fact hung out with one of my high school buddies who lives down here in South Florida just a couple of days ago interestingly we didn't reminisce about high school Boy Scouts are hurting boys my son is gone Andrea says and keifa beat up Mike Serna bitch I didn't really beat up Mike they kind of shoved him around a little bit Mike's a big guy he held his own Boy Scouts are hurting my my son is gone you know yeah my brother I have a nephew he's gonna be 13 in August and he was always on the fence about Boy Scouts play some lacrosse and soccer and he loves golf and just doing all that I never really had time for Boy Scouts you thought about it now it completely off the table in our family because of their far left far left plant and it's going to be an indoctrination Darla did we go to high school together and did you just want to know if if I remember high school I would love to know Canada needs a first and second amendment yes you do no further commentary on that I saw some of these assaults you guys are talking about he fends really looking forward to in Trump rights at gfy we know what that means go after yourself letter to Justin Trudeau it can't happen soon enough here's the thing right Trump grew up in Queens a few neighborhoods away from where I did I know the kind of guy yeah I mean it kind of feels bad for Trudeau we didn't take him seriously he knows that Trump you know Trump knows that hey look pandas are a friend if anything god forbid ever happens we're a an aggressive force heads toward Canada we're gonna help them out anyway I want to say this I've interfaced with Justin Trudeau is not representative of the law enforcement in military in Canada in my travels I've interfaced with the RCMP investigators with the RCMP and their investigators phenomenal cops top-notch cops are with them on cases back in the day and I've met some of your Special Operations guys especially from jtf2 hard core operators hard core operators it's sad that a guy like Trudeau betrays just how good they D in Special Operations military law enforcement your pilot's are and I suspect though so many Canadians I engage with now since I've been with the rebel I I don't think it's long before Canada has an awakening like the United States had and you find yourself with a trump esque kind of guy or girl home in your country I and I certainly hope so I certainly hope so best time 0:39 Japan South Korea Turkey and Iran last countries that still fly the f4 phantom I think you're right this is still a bunch of metaphors out there and that plane was just bad ass it was very very cool very very cool and you applied for a job as a supply host I don't know I'm not HR but hey now they know you want one Oh they've heard me uh okay here we go guys so uh let's talk about this a because couple more questions earlier that I didn't get to about Muller I'm very troubled when when Muller was first appointed I thought Muller was an ethical actor and now I don't 13:16 now Hillary supporting Democrats on his team all of this all of these issues with exculpatory evidence not being disclosed and more full disclosure I know general Flynn I'm friendly with the Flynn family I predict would be wrong clearly I'm on this stuff a general Flynn will ultimately come out of this okay roll BAP says the RCMP have been reduced to bellhops at the Board of processing illegal that's pretty much what I mean your RCMP are incredibly well trained cops they're good at what they do they're our investigators are some of the best in the world squared away precise very sad what liberal agendas are doing to them rogue gen says I'm an Eagle Scout and I hate where it's gonna last you they're homosexuals at the troop discretion level now girls listen I think it's not unique to the Boy Scouts to Eagle by the way and n congratulations rising to level Eagle Scout is no easy feat Congrats for that but it's it's tragic how traditional institutions around the world not just here in the US done in Canada around the world are being attacked by the left by the left somebody just Lauren southern said isn't in the best interest of businesses in Ontario to have the highest electric bills in North America it is never in the interest of any business to be burdened with more expenses a business could be left to keep as much of its earned money as possible because left to its own devices business wants to grow and that business will ultimately reinvest in its people in research and development and new products and new trucks and expansion only good things happen to an economy Lauren when businesses are allowed to keep more of their own money only only good things only good things really I we saw that with tax reform here in the US I had a friend talking about tariffs and tax reform very wealthy guy older guy in his 70s and he owns a business ribeyes i mean excuse me about 7 million pounds of aluminum yearly and he said that he is already starting to see the benefits already already it's been months it's been months and his business is starting to see benefits and he predicts this is gonna mean a lot to his bottom line so what was the first thing he said to me he said yeah I'm gonna hire like a hundred more people a hundred more people a hundred more people because he's gonna his costs are coming down Oscar coming downs is gonna be able to make more product he's ready back ordered a hundred jobs will be created in this one business here down in Miami down in Miami it is it is uh lake runner says feminist agenda pushing men as a doormat Blake you hit a sore spot with me this drives me nuts these tell it the emasculation of men the feminization of men these television commercials where the woman goes into the loan officers office at the bank puts her feet on the desk and our moron husband is sitting in the corner and the guy goes hey do you want to add anything and he's now just having water it's embarrassing and it's not what men are supposed to be look I'm not saying women aren't supposed to be strong and engage in business god bless them god bless them do that but don't portray the men as this more on the sheepish little fool sitting in the corner it's sending a terrible message to American boys the Canadian boys to British boys to men around the world the men around the world Andrea I love Andrea's uh one of the best commenters today let men be men let boys grow into men it's beneficial to the world and especially women it is if you look at the crime rates here in the United States they skyrocketed right after the 60s when that whole movement of getting away from traditional marriage and divorce and an alternative lifestyle started to spring up okay Chad's 1422 thank you for bringing this up I was gonna get there in three minutes perfect timing my friend another lie by black lives matter activist Sherita Dixon Cole blaming police for raping her after being pulled over okay you guys haven't seen this story and I talked about this on my show off-the-cuff Declassified today why I'm now a fan of police body cameras this woman accused Texas Highway Patrol trooper department Public Safety trooper Hubbard Daniel Hubbard of raping her after he pulled her over for DWI black lives matter activist Shaun King that white guy who makes believe he's black blasted the trooper on Twitter an attorney a black activist social justice attorney called Esley Merritt named Ashley Merritt blasted the trooper well the de Texas Department of Public Safety released that dashcam video two hours of it Rupert acted professionally all of these racists are now forced to may a culpa but you know they haven't done they've been apologized to the trooper it's disgraceful guys you were right an absolute lie disgusting the disgusting Dave Haji says pacification of boys continues Dave you're right it's disgraceful no good and going back to the police officer real quick the trooper he was professional he was courteous he's agency backed them up and I love I love that these these lying criminals social justice warriors now look like fools BH said they look so stupid on that dashcam video no yes they do yes they do and I couldn't be happier you know when I intro that segment on my other show here on the rebel today I said I love doing this every day and you guys can say I'm having fun here this is really really fun for me but that was a story I was so excited to bring you I loved it it was awesome that was awesome uh steak Joan of Arc Jean of Arc Wow we have really important people joining us this is a feminists are jealous and resentful of men all these Marxist groups seem to be based on jealousy and resentment of the other group yeah yeah feminists are just like fix who can't get dates Billy in there they're bitter and angry and then they wonder why and look there are many feminists out there that are really attractive but they're so mean and nasty and angry they wonder why no guy wants to take them to dinner maybe if you're just like no get a little sweeter you were more of a civil human being you might not be so miserable Andrea I've never been happier for police departments up out of the sjw's er dashcams well and Andrea now you sit it you say it proves just how wrong the social justice warriors sorry yeah not only that now all of a sudden because these dash cams these body cams or having unintended consequences well no so now they're racist real men fish no I have not seen any truth to these reports of the FCC rated CNN and aap for spreading fake news now don't believe these conspiracy theories I look good rule of thumb unless the outlet or the individual bringing new reports is a known commodity don't fall for clickbait and typically have a story like that was true it would have it would be pop top align news you know the right reporting it in favori to the left reporting it against but at least you would see credible outlets pushing out so when it's some random site they've never heard of I wouldn't I wouldn't believe it Barbara green third wave from Barbara green mmm third wave feminists like rabid animals they don't even know what fighting for rights really was like because they never had to fight for anything in our lives yeah right isn't that true aren't they normally these over educated PhD trust-fund babies who have been handed everything their entire everything their entire lives in it just like hate the world anyway great point hunky monkey Obama was awful for Israel Obama crossed Israel war and soldiers Obama was horrible for the world many many people died at the hands of Isis brutally brutally because Obama did nothing Obama did nothing Raigarh I says a great you know rehgar there's a great well I might actually use this and I'll give you attribution body cams revealing a fatal flaw in the victimization industry plot twist love that quote thank you for that thank you for that that was a great one mm-hmm you know Obama was Heather says uh Andrea rather has a mama was an anti-semite I think Obama hated everybody that wasn't a multiculturalist Muslim sympathizer I think Obama fundamentally hated the United States look I don't subscribe to birth or conspiracy theory I think Obama was born in Hawaii but I think Obama grew up in Indonesia and these Muslim countries I think Barack Obama didn't fundamentally identify with the United States he didn't go to 4th of July parades he didn't play Little League he didn't grow up like I did like other American kids did like many Canadian kids do I have friends from it I grew up in New York City and I've always said moranto is always a very comfortable place for me to be very similar the city looks very similar if people are very similar a lot of Canadian friends and down here in South Florida as you well know if you're up in Canada even in the UK a lot of people from Canada in the UK on condos down here in South Florida many many friends from both countries and there's a lot of similarities to us culturally Obama didn't have that he was much more like a kid who grew up in Southeast Asia or in South Asia weird weird guy wake up asks me thoughts on Elon Musk's idea for journalism I talked about that I did a segment on my show today I loved it I loved that Elon Musk if you don't know what he's talking about what the commenter wake up is talking about Elon Musk wants to set up a site berate the credibility and ethics ethics and honesty of journalists and journalistic outlets I think it is amazing idea he he believes people care about the truth they do right New York Times says Hamas announces from hunky monkey moslems broke through Israel's borders but more Muslims would rush in but they got shot yeah that sums it up that was a good analysis there hunky it was and Hamas even admitted that those breaking in were Hamas terrorists hey they did so and it's a tactic of Hamas its attack to use large groups of people especially women and children as human shields but also as a diversion of their terror cells can break in other places Jim trap wink I'm 52 years old I was in the Boy Scouts and made it to life having girls as Scouts will keep boys from being boys and turning into good and strong men boys need a place of their own Jim perfectly stated sir but not a said it better myself excellent excellent comment thank you very very much for that it's uh it's really tragic but again it's an assault on our institutions you know an assault on our institutions it's tragic it's it's tragic brant goshu says feminists don't have children they use minorities to fill that void that's a good point they use protected classes to fill that void that's a really really good point we see that in the women's March they we see that in we see that in the women's March we see that in these black lives matter marches we see it any in the me to movement there are the victimization industry as regular mentioned the victimization let's call it from now on you know the the the BVI see the big victim industrial complex right I mean big victim right this is a new Lobby big victim and it is now an industry millions of dollars are flowing in to these groups Alli Clark thank you very much for that donation but you didn't ask a question at wish you would have thank you very very much it was very generous very very nice of you uhh el chupacabras has been so bad for him Quezon or her I don't know for the male or female they haven't seen a single new Star Wars movie well neither have I I have to work a lot I don't have much time I'm pretty much exclusively a pay-per-view guy now good watch two great movies though darkest hour with Gary Oldman about Winston Churchill thought it was awesome and 12 strong about that first special forces unit to go into Afghanistan and they did a lot of the fighting on horseback really cool films if you haven't seen them both of them really worth watching Blake we're on another good topic NFL told their athletes they can't kneel to the anthem or they're gonna be consequences if you want a kneel for the national anthem I don't if you saw this the NFL has sent down a rule then a rule you have to kneel from the locker room if you come out on the sidelines and it's not just players it's anyone who works for the team Donnie Gerbert just gave us a donation Donnie thank you so much your question is John would you care for a discussion about how to automate Congress direct republic not direct remark was a democracy if fundamentally a great idea as long as we could prevent fraud but I do like the concept of live meetings with your representatives I don't want to fully automate it so fundamentally I think it gives a lot of access people who can't physically get to Washington DC to Skype or the representative things like that as long as we can prevent fraud and we don't automate it to the point where people don't have audiences with their elected representatives I think that one-to-one is still very important in our constitutional republic very important but I would love to hear more about it I certainly would so reach out to me on Twitter I'd love to hear more about your proposals because it's always been something I've been interested mm-hmm st. Jean of York says donkey monkey I knew when I heard about Israeli shooting Palestinians it had to be a press op turn public opinion terrorist groups always do this yeah and Hamas backed off of it and admitted they were the bad guys coming across defense pastor Phil Biggs says Elon Musk's idea was great in a past environment but it's seeing-eye ever seen our truth can be twisted by the left it will become another tool to silence conservatives I'm not so sure Elon Musk isn't really a liberal the Liberals have actually been pretty cruel to musk and musk was if you've passed or failed have you been reading Elon Musk's Twitter timeline it's been the liberal media attacking him and him pushing back on them pretty aggressively so go read it and then excuse me you might you might have a different opinion on this as 1422 did the kid a great question Chazz I wouldn't even thought to bring this up did the case of Daniel holtzclaw be revisited in light of all the police pull over lies yes if you're not familiar Daniel holtzclaw an Oklahoma police officer accused of rape sitting in prison I believe he's innocent Michelle Malkin was a good good friend of mine Michelle is wonderful she's become very close to the holtzclaw family she and Nick short they're doing amazing work on this go over to Michelle Malkin calm and see what she's doing officer holtzclaw is a victim he should be clear there is so much misconduct as on the part of Oklahoma law enforcement Oklahoma prosecutors it is a disgraceful travesty of justice and this poor guy is paying the price my answer absolutely yes hosts Clause investigation his conviction should be dismissed with prejudice he should be recompensate it for the time he spent in jail and it should definitely have a giant spotlight on it thank you great question very passionate about that case Allie Clark likes my show off the cuff Allie thank you very very much can I say I'll chip a cobra and my best Spanish accent I need to show up Ezra you know what I'm Italian fifth generation I'll try it'll trip a cobra yes how is that how is that okay let's see the world is waking up well we're getting so many comments about CBC Radio and how Tomas Tomas tried to play victim but the world is not taking it anymore the world sees through it Andrea says I think part of why this wave of leftism is taking place as the younger generations don't hear about our heritage anymore to tell the kids about the bravery of our vets and let's not sanitize history let's stop tearing down the statues and Confederate monuments let's stop attacking statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson there is this notion on the left that history has to be nice that history has to be pleasant history is bloody and miserable and brutal in most cases history is history sanitizing it serves a disservice to everyone who everyone the other gun says I was gonna say this battleground is great but it needs more accents I can try to do a New York accent although I lost that as well I you know I wish I'm gonna promise you guys one thing for the next time I sit in Perez I'm gonna brush up on my accents this accent thing is uh this accent thing is worked in Sheila yella will you help me out with an accent help me out with the accents I've got to brush up on those apparently everybody loves them one of our canoes is breaking the name Richard Clegg it as another spy talking to the Trump campaign errs people have asked me to talk about claret I have not seen enough supporting evident to one America as evidence for America's story uh I want to see some more supporting information on this before I run with it all right guys it's not that I'm trying to avoid it I had really solid information on stuff and how poor the try ran with the name like it may be the guy may not be the guy I'd rather be right than first how I built my brand it's important to me and then once we know it we can dig in really really deep we can we can go in depth we can figure out what's going on with that real men fish Netflix hiring a Chanel mama and Michelle speak look here's the thing about that I don't care like if they want to get the Obamas a deal and give them a deal I'm not one of these boycott Netflix people over this I know I'm gonna get flamed by conservatives honestly I'm a free market guy right and so here's the way I see it I'm not gonna rush out and cancel my Netflix but if I see Netflix programming become universally for a left well then it's not for me and I'm gonna cancel organically anyway but I'll see you know how much they give Barack and Michelle and how much content how much production oversight they have before I rush out and cancel it cuz I'll admit on the shows on Netflix I really like they're pretty good and I'm not yet finished with him so I've got to continue now Jesus is Lord is right he says Michelle Obama says she is the forever first lady I wish she would be the forever I'm going away first lady it was a ridiculous comment real man fish has accents a great job but it was a favor and don't do a fresh ax a French accent I couldn't if I tried Thames is trying to get me to sing karaoke the bar would empty out I'm not that guy I am NOT musically inclined can barely play the radio pretty sad because I was on the radio for time and look I I agree if you guys want to boycott Netflix if you are offended by this do it do it I'm just not there yet I'm not there yet I don't do that books I do Amazon Prime so do I like Amazon Prime but don't kid yourself Amazon pretty left-leaning as well yeah Andrea Netflix is programming is leftist for the most part their original content but some of the old shows and I will admit some of their original series historical ones especially the ones the documentaries about drug traffickers things like that they're pretty good I'm a fan of narcos actually know some of the agents featured in narcos through my law enforcement work so those are pretty good and I'll stick with it until they're so far left that they're falling off California well they were all out of bed much like Nancy Pelosi does every morning and miss la Pig says she likes the show thank you so much thank you very very much appreciate it somebody asked me Washington Capitals are Vegas golden nights neither for me I'm from New York and South Florida easy out for that question how about you what's your team f sessions made 25 to 50 million dollars from the uranium to Russia deal but she invested in private prison company Vanguard that's actually been disproven pastor Phil look I've been very critical Jeff sessions I've been very critical of a lot of people but what I don't like to do is run off of these speculative theories which don't have basis in fact and that one I've looked into it is excuse me it is uh patently untrue that he reap rewards from that kind of thing so I really do like I like to vet the information before running with it it's critically important that we do that it's critically but it wake up is what the Toronto Maple Leafs well yes and you're from Toronto good for you and the Blue Jays are you definitely from Toronto hometown and the Raptors yes you are yeah I'm a Yankees guy what am I gonna say it is what it is and plus we live in South Florida and the Florida Marlins don't exactly when baseball games if you know what I'm saying this has been you guys have been awesome I have to tell you real men fish as the rebel is the best bang for the buck subscription I think so I'm on it the bargain in in perspective but this has been great you guys have been a lot of fun keep the comments coming and like I said I love I've always loved life I love doing live television I love doing live radio taking the calls oh let's say okay doctors haven't even ever announces it dr. Lappe Don what should happen to Obama have proven had a hand in spying on Trump broke federal laws should be prosecuted to be prosecuted if the very least his reputation should be shamed and spirit and out it I mean pretty the hour goes by so fast miss little pig you're right he fends the Red Sox fan Jim Jamison the Havana Ducks I like this now we learned everybody sports team we're going back to dr. slappy dr. slappy hi this is a very small font here oh yeah I think if Obama was complicit in this and he engaged in illegal wrongdoing he should be prosecuted like anybody else no one is above the law Raigarh says that's alright though about Netflix we Millennials are gonna put cable out of business because streaming is better yeah you know it's funny I have the rec TV and I do watch streaming more than any of that Alley Clark asked me if I think anyone will actually see jail time corrupt FBI Clinton I'm not optimistic but I will wait until the Inspector General report drops I think that's gonna be very telling very very telling I would be surprised if Andrew McCabe and possibly James Comey do not face prosecution vizac says come on John show up Ezra El Chupacabra I guess how'd I do let's see if I can do it again l kept acaba ah better better El Chapo kabbala no better little not good with accent lead Sheila back to help me Barbara says no one will see jail time they'll just buy their way out of everything Barbara whatever greed is a year ago but from some sources I'm hearing that it might be some movement I'm still pessimistic but a bit more hopeful than I was couple years ago Rhaegar liked my chupacabra okay good poof ooh a mighty this point you guys Pass Phil I I know that channel you're talking about I've watched it I've not been able to have not been able to even verify those people were for it were in fact intelligence officers again it's uh you can't even bet that those 700 or legit I like to stay away from stuff like that but listen I hear you it's all very very concerning ally Clarke says nope Cardillo you failed Ezra kills it on accents hey I know my strengths I know my weakness is accents ain't one Ally but hopefully you like the rest of this it worries me something I heard rebel got some of their stuff blocked on Facebook from Darla McKinnon yeah Facebook has been a little bit heavy-handed with the rebel recommending that the rebel shut down its Facebook page but really not explaining what was offensive pretty clear what's going on they're just more conservative backlash or I should say backlash against conservatives Andrea says I wish conservatives had better options with social media Andrea so do I so do I but unfortunately rebel v6 like Maya Chupacabra ha unfortunately Facebook and Twitter or what they are they're gigantic organizations now they're you know world global brands gonna be very hard to compete with them I want to sign from rebel media stay off my lawn okay somebody over here might might be able to make that happen for you shouldn't be too tough mind if it's in sharpie on a piece of printer paper you're okay with that I could do it for you not a problem Facebook and YouTube or censoring conservatives Andrea tells us yes they are all of social media John Zeeland says clapper should shut his trapper I agree or actually should keep talking and we can use it against them in a criminal proceeding my personal DJ vlog asked my personal thoughts on immigration simple legal immigration is legal illegal immigration is illegal and should be shut down Gavin McInnes is the king of accents Craig McDonald says Gavin is a really good friend of mine actually plug Gavin last week NBC had a drink with him nobody nobody does accents like Gavin I'll give you that one Gavin is outstanding at his accent they're talking about YouTube commenters conservative YouTube commenters who we shut down yes yes free speech in North America under attack diamond and silk love their show Blake runner diving in silk are actually dear friends of mine I was with them in DC last week as well we're all sort of a same event and what they've gone through is terrible diamond and silk are two of the nicest women you will ever meet not pretentious just too sweet girls from North Carolina and I am so glad I'm so glad at the way they called out our Congress here in the United States so glad they've done Oh Kim Jamison says that sign is to be in English and French I can give you the English version come on guys help me out could anybody give him the French I'm not your guy for that as well either us so sorry about that no French accents or French writing here yeah but diamond it's silk are awesome and let me tell you this is really taking its toll on them they're very upset they spoke about it mmm-hmm mark cutter says it's okay too important of the 40 million dem voters so long as it's legal well look legal immigrants tend not to vote Democrat we see that legal immigrants typically mirror the US population and the voter breakdown so I'm not I'm not going to condemn people that follow our laws wait in line and do it right the United States really is in that respect and they should have immigrants I'm italian-american my family came here four generations ago on one side five generations on the other legally so I'd be very hypocritical if I insulted legal immigration and Donald Trump's wife is illegal immigrant ain't voting Democrat nor did my family Jesus is Lord says Canada someone's got very popular very fast well Candice is a real sharp girl he's a good friend and I think she deserved it she went where people were too afraid to go and she's built her brand then I'll I quit uh what Candice is doing and I'm more power to her obligee because more famous he's a very effective voice hilary will have the greatest defense of all time the prosecutor will have to have said from hunky monkey i have to make sure his Ducks are in a row if the prosecutor loses it'll be a milli a ting I don't think Hillary is getting prosecuted I don't think she's getting prosecuted I would hope well my Abidine does I would hope Hillary does but unfortunately I just don't think I just don't think we're gonna see it it's unfortunate but look something needs to happen here in America we now feel we have three standards of justice one for the regular people one for the political and celebrity elite and another if you happen to know the Clintons maybe in for if you are the Clintons are the Clintons you don't even get interviewed under oath your interviews aren't more realized you can pretty much come and go as you please it's pretty disgraceful a white night prod says legal immigration is a great thing it's just unregulated influx of people that is bad couldn't agree more and illegal immigration should have to be shut down and have to be shut down nobody asked me by barring got shut down on YouTube I have no idea don't have any idea haven't really dug into it keep crawling illegal immigrants what they are illegal not undocumented actually call them illegal aliens because they are criminal illegal aliens every illegal alien is a criminal illegal because they are here illegally ergo they are criminals and if you noticed the Washington Post excoriated President Trump saying well he was condemning and calling all immigrants horrible names for the actions of a few a few Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Tom Holman yesterday noted that there are 10,000 ms-13 gang members in the u.s. two thousand on Long Island New York a little bit more than a few Washington Post a little bit more than a few rumor walks and Weiner gets the shaft Rooter doggy says hello there's so many jokes we can make about that but unfortunately weiners a pedophile terrible guy who Aberdeen could be prosecuted in much the same way she physically with a horrid device a thumb drive or something of that nature what classified info on his laptop to hide it Puma should be prosecuted absolutely amandajoy says Facebook keeps from moving my conservative comments not surprising Amanda they've done it to me as well they have done it to me as well Raigarh like Hurley says I like her illegal immigration was opposed by Democrats not even a decade ago now you're racist if you want people to come in under the same law Raigarh the Democratic Party is the party of hypocrisy so we should expect more of that in the future we should expect more of that in the future it's it's really the party of gross hypocrisy and yeah illegal immigration the legal ms-13 mmm is 13 is a brutal vicious vicious organization a brutal vicious organization frankly I think Trump is too nice call I'm animals Sarah Huckabee Sanders press secretary was right these people are savages they are subhuman they are sub animal I have pets they're wonderful they're loving I mr. t need to be put down like the rabid savages that they are Blake's going back to work in his butcher shop no PETA
