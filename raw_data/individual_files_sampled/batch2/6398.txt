now the other day Kellyanne Conway actually said something refreshing yeah believe it or not right I mean it wasn't a grand statement it was a very obvious statement but at least she said it so let's watch a lot of people think that Roy Moore should be removed oh and I'll repeat what our White House director of legislative affairs said on a Sunday show we were on different Sunday shows whatever the facts end up being the the premise is of course the principle the incontrovertible principle is that there's no Senate seat that's worth more than a child we all want to put that forward I have three daughters and a son and frankly we all are watching this there you go finally something good out of Kellyanne Conway no Senate seat is worth the life of a child I think at least all of us can agree to that that was on November 16th well she went on Fox and Friends again this morning and thinks well maybe there is something worth a child's life let's watch I think the Democrats are in big trouble because they have to defend 25 Senate seats next year ten in states the president won five he won by massive double digits and doug jones in alabama folks don't be fooled he'll be a vote against tax cuts he's weak on crime weak on borders he's strong on raising your taxes he's terrible for property owners so dr. narrow liberal which is why he's not saying anything and why the media are trying to boost him so vote Roy Moore I'm telling you that we want the votes in in that in the Senate to get this tax this tax bill through and the the media if the media were really concerned about all these allegations and that what this was truly about in the Democrats Al Franken would be on the ash heap of bygone 1/2 funny comedians oh so there is something worth a child's life integrity and the violation of a girl who was 14 years old it turns out it's tax cuts we have our answer well nothing is worth that I mean unless we're gonna give tax cuts of billionaires and to multinational corporations then really what's the little child molestation among friends Kellyanne Conway those you're two sets of words there one saying nothing is worth it then coming back on and saying yes we want your votes for ROI more because of tax cuts by the way what are you talking about senator Franken is all over the news we've covered them in the past we're going to cover them again today and you want to tell you want to bring up senator Franken and allegations of touching women inappropriately well then your boss should resign immediately because there's 16 of those allegations against them these people have no bounds of decency at all here's more from Kellyanne Conway who thinks apparently life a child is not that big a deal if she's got tax cuts but the RNC is withdrawing support for Roy Moore Mitch McConnell's withdrawing support so with the Young Republicans vote with Tory's support a lot of women right and you know what the I just want everybody knows Doug Jones nobody ever says his name and they pretend that he's some kind of conservative Democrat in Alabama and he's not telling you Andy yes will the president be going back down to Alabama to campaign on behalf of Roy Moore before the special election there's no plan to do that oh so I see that's the distinction in fact mark short the White House legislative affairs director said if he did not believe that the woman's accusations were credible or foreign to Trump he would be down campaigning for more he has not done that which actually makes it worse so he does believe the women he believes that Roy Moore drove 14-year old 30 minutes into the woods took off almost all her clothes and tried to get her to touch his naked genitalia a 14-year old which is against the law in Alabama apparently he believes them that's why he's not down there campaigning but he sent Kellyanne Conway on TV to say a child in the woods naked a man in his 30s taking advantage of that child what's the big deal we got tax cuts for the rich we got a pass remember don't vote for the other guy we need votes for Roy Moore your position Kellyanne is crystal clear if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network comm sighs join
