irregardless not a worse well irregardless of that irregardless is a word and we're duty-bound to enter it my name is Cory Stamper and I am a lexicographer for merriam-webster that means that I am a writer and editor of dictionary one word that gets a lot of vitriol is the word irregardless there is a dictionary entry for irregardless irregardless is a word this inspires specific the imman hatred in people irregardless ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends I mean it's just like the rules of feminism irregardless is a word it is related to regardless it is actually a blend of two words it's a blend of irrespective and regardless people hate it because they say that it has no use why not just use regardless but actually in the dialect that irregardless comes from it has a specific use that doesn't translate well in print it's basically an emphatic use of regardless so if you're a native speaker of certain dialects that use irregardless you use irregardless to shut down for their conversation on the topic I might say dad let me borrow the car I'm a really good driver and he'll say regardless I'm not comfortable I'll say oh but come on get it detailed and I'll put gas in it will say irregardless know the point of the irregardless is to shut down conversation because you're always late and you take no responsibility for your actions every Bloodless so irregardless is a word it has a specific use in particular dialects that said it's not part of standard English and so especially if you're writing or if you're speaking in formal places you want to use regardless instead because if you use there regardless people will think you're uneducated
