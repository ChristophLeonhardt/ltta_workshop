00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
hi friends so traveling is a huge

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,589
privilege it's definitely not something

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,870
that everyone gets to do it's not

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,580
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my parents got to do when</font>

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,139
they were younger so once they had the

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,519
means to<font color="#CCCCCC"> travel when they were older</font>

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,610
they went all out they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> guide books</font>

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,920
they saw travel agents they booked tours

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,390
they traveled with the understanding

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,990
that hey this may be the only time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,180
to be in this place in my life so I

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,830
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to miss anything important</font>

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,500
but ever the ungrateful child that I am

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,410
I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that style a little too</font>

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,250
mainstream once when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 17 sulking on</font>

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,230
the top of a double-decker tour bus in

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,870
New York City<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nirvana in my ear buds I</font>

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,600
vowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do things differently I didn't</font>

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,840
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be looking down on everything I</font>

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,450
wanted to be in it so when I visited in

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,239
city I don't do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> too much planning in</font>

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,789
advance I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit a place as if I</font>

23
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,100
live there I'll get food at a grocery

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,280
store and eat it in a park I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,969
an art museum and a bookstore I just

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,820
wander it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovely way to exist</font>

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,979
in a place and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost start to feel</font>

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> local in every way except that if</font>

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,630
I were actually a local I would be

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,000
sitting in my own apartment not doing

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything which is what after living in</font>

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,220
my third new city in less than a year I

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,799
catch myself doing more often than not I

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play so tourist-oriented</font>

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,310
that when I tell people where I am I'm

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,290
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> met with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wait people live there</font>

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,650
but I myself don't get out much so I

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,240
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to travel</font>

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,280
like a local that when I'm actually

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,829
local I should try living like a tourist

41
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,890
my current residents

42
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,960
a definite expiration date I'm only

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,900
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live here once so why not act</font>

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,610
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tried in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the moments that</font>

45
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,560
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to to check out some</font>

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,570
monuments and landmarks that I thought I

47
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">would never see a couple weeks ago I</font>

48
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,650
went up in this massive ferris wheel

49
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,660
they have here and from way up there I

50
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,880
could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find so</font>

51
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,040
strange about this place there's this

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,979
concentrated burst of every kind of

53
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,899
glittering light in the universe and

54
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">then suddenly seemingly nothing who</font>

55
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,020
would have thought that I'd find<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

56
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,410
here and that I think is a different

57
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of wandering so in the comments</font>

58
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,150
