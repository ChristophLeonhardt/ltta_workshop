hey everyone hope all is well the world

<font color="#E5E5E5">currently faces some very serious</font>

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,390
challenges and so I find it quite

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,309
troubling to see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge disconnect</font>

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,650
forming between the general public and

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">to institutions that are supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

serve us the media and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government it</font>

is the latter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,320
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on in today's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,180
firstly though I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to consider</font>

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,760
the issue of climate change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy in life to surround yourself with</font>

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,020
like-minded people with those who share

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,870
similar values and ideas what I like to

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,940
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep it varied it helps broaden</font>

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,430
your horizons see other perspectives and

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,640
challenge your own ideas and therefore I

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,649
actually know quite a few people who are

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,110
climate change deniers and it has led to

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">some pretty interesting conversations</font>

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,520
many climate change deniers say it is a

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,500
hoax that governments use as a pretext

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,870
for raising taxes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general</font>

24

population there is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> some truth</font>

to this statement but<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately</font>

26
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,690
half-truths can sometimes be more

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,369
dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a complete fabrication</font>

28
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the suspicion often arises because</font>

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,600
government's proposed policies around

taxing carbon and fuel consumption

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,369

well if it really is such a catastrophic

showing more urgency in action or

45
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,600
ineffective action by governments can

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,460
cause the public to lose sight of

47
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,729
genuine problems and their solutions

00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,530
let's now look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at another topic where</font>

this process has occurred immigration

the answer to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

about are they living on another planet

here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Washington bubble in the US and</font>

I'm pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there are many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

where immigration has been high

97
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,949
immigration would become much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

98
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,349
issue in mainstream political discussion

99
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,060
so like is the case with climate change

100
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">if government officials aren't upfront</font>

101
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,560
and honest with the public whether due

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,260
to incompetence or negligence this

103
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,030
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just create skepticism around</font>

104
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,120
one issue but it creates cynicism of the

105
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,400
entire political structure to this can

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,379
be incredibly dangerous in the long term

107
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,329
because it means when politicians have

108
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,190
identified genuine problems and

109
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,379
solutions and then communicate them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

110
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,780
the public they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

111
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,370
the trust of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are meant to be</font>

112
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,650
serving and thus the public ends up

113
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,630
rejecting effective ideas that could

114
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,029
help them all because they no longer

that I aim to address on future videos

there are some people who believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>
