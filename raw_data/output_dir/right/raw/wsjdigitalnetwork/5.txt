1
00:00:00,723 --> 00:00:03,140
(calm music)

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,290
- I want lawmakers to
see that it's just not

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,530
one high school trying to create change.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,150
It's multiple high schools,
it's multiple students,

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,410
and it's the nation that
wants to see change.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,250
- I think the walkout is a way to show

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,650
how strong our generation is
and how much power we have

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,750
and the power of our voices as a whole.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,090
- I think that it's the same point

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,730
that we've been trying to make all along,

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,000
just in a more symbolic way,
that we're not going away.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,060
- For us it has been
overwhelming being in the media

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,350
and being in the public
eye, but we need to be.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,547
And all schools need to be because

15
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,520
it shows that we need to be safe.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,870
- As hard as they try to
maybe make the country

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,570
ignore us or divert the attention

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,871
away from it, we're not going away.

19
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:54,270
We're not gonna let that happen.

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,510
- My feelings are like a wave.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,300
At some points I feel nothing at all

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,380
and that's really hard because
I don't want to feel okay.

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,180
It's a weird things to say,
but I want to feel upset.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,080
But the points I'm upset I just

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,600
wonder when will this feeling end?

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
Like when will I feel okay again?

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,455
- We, out of everybody,
understand the consequences

28
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:27,120
of ignoring this kind of
thing over and over again

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,240
and we're not gonna let that
happen to another community.

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,824
- What happened to me and my school

31
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,930
will forever change the rest of my life

32
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,860
and I would forever fight
for what I believe in

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,530
and for gun reform and gun control

34
00:01:38,530 --> 00:00:00,000
because it just hits so hard to home.
