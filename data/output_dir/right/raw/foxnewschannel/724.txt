BIGGEST ARGUMENT AGAINST IT WAS

THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A

55
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,429
LEGITIMATE PRESIDENTIAL POWER,

56
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,265
THAT THIS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP

57
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:02,867
HAD EXERCISED IT WITH IMPURE

58
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:03,968

61
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:12,876

64
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:17,748
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

65
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:18,983
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRAZY

66
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,721
IT'S A RELIEF RELAY THAT THE

67
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:26,224

SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE

70
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,193
OF WHETHER IT WAS A RELIGIOUS

71
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:30,228
TEST ARE NOT POINTING OUT THAT

72
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,634
USING A LIST THAT HAD BEEN

73
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:37,235
DEVELOPED BY A PREVIOUS

74
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:38,669
ADMINISTRATION, THE OBAMA

75
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,437
ADMINISTRATION.

76
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:40,338
AND THAT IT ALSO INCLUDED

77
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:41,839
NORTH KOREA AND VENEZUELA SO

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,341
THAT IT WAS HARD TO ARGUE THAT

79
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,942
THIS WAS -- EVEN THOUGH THIS IS

80
00:02:44,943 --> 00:02:45,776
WHAT THE CONVERSATION HAD BEEN

81
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:47,211
IN THE MEDIA, THIS IS A

82
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:48,946
MUSLIM BAN AND EVEN DONALD TRUMP

83
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:50,248
REFERRED TO IT IS THAT, THIS

84
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:50,982
REALLY IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION

85
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,623
DECISIONS ABOUT NATIONAL

86
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:00,658
SECURITY RELATED TO IMMIGRATION.

87
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:01,392
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW

88
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:03,194
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FARED

89
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:03,895
WITH THE SUPREME COURT WHEN IT

90
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:05,630
TESTED EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY.

91
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:06,731
IT REPEATEDLY WAS TURNED AWAY BY

92
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:11,535
THE COURT, SOMETIMES BY 9-0

93
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,210
THE SUBJECT OF EXECUTIVE

94
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,378
AUTHORITY.

95
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,413
>> Bret: HERE'S ONE

96
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,881
COMMENTATOR ON ANOTHER CHANNEL

97
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:29,654
WITH AN INTERESTING ANALOGY.

98
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:31,422
>> OSAMA BIN LADEN HOPE TO

99
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,490
PROVOKE WAS A WAR OF

100
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:33,958
CIVILIZATION, AND WAR BETWEEN

101
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,428
THE WEST AND 1 BILLION MUSLIMS.

102
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:38,429
SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP AND THIS

103
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,965
MUSLIM BAN SIGNAL TO THE WORLD

104
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:44,435
IS THAT MUSLIMS ARE NOT WELCOME

105
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:47,405
HERE, THAT THIS IS, WHETHER THE

106
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,440
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES SAY THAT

107
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:50,641
IT'S ABOUT EXECUTIVE POWER, THE

108
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:52,843
PRESIDENT'S CLEAR INTENT WAS TO

109
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:53,611
IMPOSE A RELIGIOUS TEST AND THAT

110
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:56,414
IS IS FUNDAMENTALLY ON

111
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,482
UN-AMERICAN AS ANYTHING THAT HE

112
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:01,852
IS DONE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS

113
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:02,253
PRESIDENCY.

114
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:04,555
LOOKING AT THE WORDS ON THE

115
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:07,425
PAPER THERE?

116
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,293
>> I WOULD LIKE TO JUST REACT TO

117
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:11,562
THAT IN TANDEM WITH REACTING TO

118
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:11,862
BYRON.

119
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:13,898
BYRON IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

120
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,566
IF YOU JUST TOOK THE 3.0 VERSION

121
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:16,901
OF THIS, NOT THE FIRST TWO,

122
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:20,638
WHICH WERE QUITE DIFFERENT, THE

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,706
BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS THE PROBLEM

124
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:24,342
THE PRESIDENT CREATED FOR

125
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,377
HIMSELF THROUGH ALL THIS

126
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:29,246
EXTRAVAGANT HOSTILE RHETORIC

127
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,448
TOWARDS MUSLIMS.

128
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,148
GEORGE W. BUSH OF COURSE, WHO

129
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:39,390
JUST THE ISLAMIST TERRORISTS AND

130
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,259
SO I THINK THAT COMMENTATOR YOU

131
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,260
JUST PUT UP THERE HAS A POINT

132
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:45,563
THAT THE ATMOSPHERICS AROUND

133
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,435
DECISION IS NOT EVERYTHING THAT

134
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:55,840
HAS TERRIBLE ATMOSPHERICS THAT'S

135
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:56,474
PERHAPS EVEN STUPID AND

136
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:08,119
I DON'T CONSIDER THIS SO MUCH

137
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,221
VICTORY OR EVEN A VINDICATION

138
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,322
WHICH IS THE PRESIDENT'S OTHER

139
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,423
WORD FOR THIS.

140
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:13,924
I THINK WHEN HE GOT FROM THE

141
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,561
SUPREME COURT TODAY WAS A RATHER

142
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,295
BEGRUDGING ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGMENT

143
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,264
THAT OKAY, YOU CAN DO THIS IF

144
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,499
YOU INSIST.

145
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,436
THERE'S NO RHETORIC IN ANY OF

146
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,438
THE MAJORITY OR CONCURRING

147
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,239
OPINION SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

148
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,112
STOP YOU SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD.

149
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:38,783
>> Bret: BUT AT ITS HEART, AN

150
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:41,819
INCREASE IN THIS 3.0 VERSION,

151
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,455
THE STIPULATIONS TO GET IN, WHAT

152
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:45,156
THESE COUNTRIES WERE DOING TO

153
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:47,158
VET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY

154
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:53,631
TAKEN OFF BECAUSE THEY MET THE

155
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:54,265
STIPULATIONS.

156
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:54,999
>> IT'S HARD TO ARGUE THAT IT

157
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,836
IN FACT I THINK THE FIRST

158
00:05:58,837 --> 00:05:59,503
VERSION OF THE VAN ACTUALLY

159
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:02,440
WOULD HAVE HELD UP UNDER THE

160
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:06,644
ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE ATMOSPHERICS

161
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:11,582
INJUNCTION AGAINST A NATIONAL

162
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:11,916
RULING.

163
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,918
THIS IS A TREND THAT WE ARE

164
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,552
SEEING A LOT, PARTICULARLY

165
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:19,957
NATIONAL ISSUES AND CLARENCE

166
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,258
THOMAS SPECIFICALLY SAID IN HIS

167
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,460
CONCURRING OPINION THAT THIS IS

168
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:29,533
BECAUSE IT MEANS WE ARE GETTING

169
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:33,471
VERY NARROW DECISIONS BASED ON

170
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:36,974
FAVOR OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DID

171
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:39,243
VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP THAT THEY

172
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:41,579
WERE ABLE TO GET A 5-4 DECISION

173
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:47,852
GROUPS TO ADVOCATE FOR ABORTION

174
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,254
BUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE 5-4

175
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,323
DECISIONS MEANS WE WILL SEE THIS

176
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,158
COURT CONTINUE TO BE A VERY

177
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,625
POLITICAL ISSUE.

178
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:57,795
>> Bret: IT ALL     ALSO SHOWS H

179
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:06,137
IS IMPORTANT IN THIS WORLD.

180
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,640
McCONNELL AGAIN -- HE WILL,

181
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:10,641
BUT HE SHOULDN'T.

182
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:11,842
LOOK AT SOME OF THE PRECEDENCE

183
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,245
OF THIS HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY.

184
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:21,685
SECURITY INSTANCES AND ALSO IT

185
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:24,788
SEEMED TO WANT TO CREATE SOME OF

186
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,857
THE PROPONENTS, THE OPPONENTS OF

187
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:31,262
UNITED STATES.

188
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:36,500
INTO THE UNITED STATES AND THAT

189
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:38,402
WOULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE

190
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:38,769
PRECEDENT.

191
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,605
>> Bret: ARE LATE FRIENDS

192
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:42,339
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WEIGHED IN

193
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,642
ON THIS LAST YEAR.

194
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:46,243
>> I'M NOT AGAINST TIGHTENING

195
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:46,944
THE VETTING, WE SHOULD BUT I

196
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,218
MAKE OURSELVES THINK THAT WE ARE

197
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:56,253
SAFER FROM TERRORISM.

198
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:59,657
THERE ARE A LOT OF SOURCES OF

199
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:00,257
TERRORISM.

200
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,725
THE WHOLE LIST, PROBABLY AT THE

201
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,627
BOTTOM IS THE IDEA OF

202
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:05,629
INFILTRATION FROM THE STATES.

203
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,765
THESE ARE SEVEN STATES IN 15

204
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:08,499
YEARS SINCE 9/11, THERE HASN'T

205
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,835
BEEN A SINGLE MURDER OF AN

206
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,639
>> Bret: TRUCK.

207
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
>> THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD POINT.

208
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,641
QUITE A FEW OF THE RECENT LONE

209
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:20,244
WOLF ATTACKS HAVE TAKEN PLACE BY

210
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:21,412
PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER BORN IN

211
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,580
THE UNITED STATES OR WHO WERE

212
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:28,185
IN THESE PARTICULAR COUNTRIES,

213
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:29,787
THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY

214
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:32,823
DISJOINTED, IT'S NOT COMPLETELY

215
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:35,258
DISJOINTED BUT IT'S TENUOUS.

216
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,394
WHAT THE COURTS WERE WRESTLING

217
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,697
WITH, PARTICULARLY CHIEF JUSTICE

218
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,170
SO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE

219
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,275
AND I THINK THEY FELT WE ARE

220
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:57,848
A VERY, VERY INFLAMMATORY

221
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:59,416
PRESIDENT BECAUSE IT COULD BE

222
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,417
USED LEGITIMATELY WHEN THE

223
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:01,518
PRESIDENCY IS OCCUPIED BY A

224
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,586
DIFFERENT PERSON LATER ON.

225
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,154
>> Bret: MUST WORK.

226
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:05,256
>> THE CIRCUIT COURTS THAT WERE

227
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:06,257
WILLING TO DO THAT.

228
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:06,991
NOT JUST THE NINTH CIRCUIT, THE

229
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:10,127
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

230
00:09:10,128 --> 00:00:00,000
BIG MAJORITIES WERE WILLING TO
