hi my name is Tala
my name is Baku well the bench
J boy had this romantic sci-fi quality
to it this new sound and direction for
us the inspiration comes from the cosmos
the song starts with a because this way
call is about being relieved the drum
pad on it the base of everything the
beat is video commend the vocal
the cabeza then we cover size faith you
know that flange like old prints
technique I remember I was paying a base
that would mean some kind of we are
appreciated item to do and they had this
god I remember when we should stay the
crop simple cop I can loop to never
thought of instruments separately they
always blend together sounds that don't
really have their own identity they just
know beautiful
