the president is open to visiting Moscow that was what the White House said today in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin who invited president Trump to come to the Russian capital for yet another meeting between the two world leaders not only did this invitation come on the two-year anniversary of Donald Trump's invitation to Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails but it also came just hours before President Trump met with his national security council for their very first meeting on election security after that NSC meeting the White House released a statement saying quote the president has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation state or other malicious actors but nowhere in the full press statement are the words Russia or Putin despite the fact that varied that many people in that very meeting today have concluded and believe Russia meddled in the 2016 election and that Russia will try to meddle in our elections again in fact just this week we learned about the first identified target of Russian meddling in the 2018 elections The Daily Beast first reported that the Russian intelligence agency behind the 2016 election cyber attacks targeted Senator Claire McCaskill as she began her 2018 re-election campaign in earnest in a statement the Democratic senator who's in a tough re-election campaign said quote while this attack was not successful it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this I will not be intimidated I've said it before and I will say it again Putin is a thug and a bully joining us now Evan McMullen a former CIA operative and former independent presidential candidate also back with us Ruth Marcus Evan a couple days ago Donald Trump tweeted something that opened a lot of eyes I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election okay people probably happy about that he's for saying yes to that based on the fact that no president has been tougher on Russia than me some would argue on that they will be pushing very hard for the Democrat huh they definitely don't want Trump Vladimir Putin said last week that he wanted to dump Trump to win what is Donald Trump doing with a tweet like this who's doing what he always does which is try to muddy the water he tries to say if someone accuses him of one thing then he accuses everyone else or his opponent of that same thing so that it becomes a certain I'm rubber you're glue whatever you say bounces off me and sticks absolutely and I know it sounds the childish it is childish but actually I think it works and when I say it works I'm not saying that it's a good thing it's not a good thing at all but what happens is you know and I talk to Americans across the country and they're busy they're getting their kids to school they're working hard to make ends meet and what they hear they get bits and pieces of this back and forth where somebody says the president is doing this thing wrong or he's this or is that and the president uses those same words against them and people just throw up their hands and say look I can't tell what's going on I can't tell what's true what's right what's wrong and they give up and they turn off and that's one of the most alarming things but it's a it's a it's a seemingly silly tactic but it does have an impact unfortunately no interestingly last week I was filling in for this show and I told people what my favorite analogy for for Trump is which is he has a white shirt he gets a stain on his shirt instead of changing his shirt because if there's an obvious stain there he's just stating his shirt with whatever he has on hand ketchup mustard hot sauce whatever and now and then people look and they say oh the shirts supposed to be I heard you say that and I agreed absolutely that's the tactic ruse it's not just the president who's throwing this sort of stuff out it's now john bolton his national security advisor john bolton who before this i guess was a very strong russia hawk but now he's saying the president believes the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over so we've agreed that'll be after the first of the year what's john bolton doing roof you know I first met John Bolton many years ago during the reign administration when he was a deficient of justice whose investigation he was now trashing and that's just really shameful I think that comment was one of those audience of one comments we see from administration officials so often that just a comment that's sucking up to the president using the kind of language the president likes but I want to say something I think everything Evans said was right but I think he's actually being a little bit too kind to President Trump I know that's not your usual and ho Evan which is in this way it's not just that it's I'm rubber you're glue the president is laying the potential predicate when he talks about the Russians intervening now on behalf of Democrats to do something that he liked to do in the 2016 campaign which is to complain that it's rigged yeah so if the Democrats win is it could be gonna be because the election was rigged is it gonna be because the Russians rigged the election for them this is a very very dangerous argument for him to be making it's just appalling I'm glad you brought that up Ruth because I think that this is one of the things that when we talk about the 2016 election this is one of those things that people don't remember very well what Donald Trump was doing the in the last month of the election we talked about WikiLeaks a lot but he was also going out and he was claiming that there's a global conspiracy run by the immediate elites that was trying to keep him out of office and keep the everyday man Donald Trump supporter the working man down there trying to do this because they're trying to protect their special interests he was saying these dog whistle sorts of things at the end of the campaign and what and when I read that tweet about they definitely want the Democrats I read it in the same way which is that this is him laying the groundwork for a rigged election because he thinks the Democrats have a good chance of winning in the same way that he thought in 2016 he was gonna lose and Hillary Clinton was going to win when he wins it's the biggest most amazing most historic victory and you know no matter what the popular vote was but if he loses he is just gonna do everything he can to dismiss the legitimacy of it and that is actually really what the Russians want they want Americans not to be able to trust in their democracy or trust in their elections and he is aiding and abetting them when he does this well this sort of thing is not going to help here's some new reporting from Ken Delaney and current and former officials tell NBC News that 19 months into his Presidency there is no coherent Trump administration strategy to combat foreign election interference and no single person or agency in charge in the statement the White House took issue with that saying a strategy was put in motion when jonald Trump took office no such strategy has been made public or even mentioned before Evan they don't have us they don't I mean the they don't seem to have a strategy in place there's not a strategy that's there's not a whole of government strategy individual agencies and leaders within agencies are certainly taking the action that they can take but the president has certain authorities authorities to bring these agencies together authorities to coordinate their efforts authorities to deconflict their efforts to make sure they're efficient and effective without the president's leadership we can't respond the way we need to respond so when Claire McCaskill's office doesn't fall for the spear phishing scam that fancy bear tried to to use to get into her emails the way they got into John Podesta Z mails is that just look is it just luck that she didn't fall it's luck that somebody didn't click on an email that that seemed because the email was made to look like it was coming from the Microsoft server Microsoft Exchange saying you need to change her password the prompt prompt looked legitimate it just brought you to a fake website where they were able to use that to get into this shirt email is it just luck that somebody didn't by chance click on it this time well look I think everyone's getting smarter especially in campaigns about needing to protect information but I would say that I would shy away if I were her if I were the senator and I'm sure she gets us very well from conclusively stating that she hasn't been affected effectively Act she won't know that until it's too late that's the reality so you know I'm very concerned and I think we're going to see Microsoft has already acknowledged that other 2018 candidates have been hacked I think over time we're going to learn and I have reason to believe that we will that that other candidates difficult races Democrats in the Senate are being attacked and the reason for that is they are vulnerable and the result of their elections will will impact the president and his you know his longevity potential as president if he's impeached in the house so what happens in the Senate really matters and it will likely hinge on just a couple of races Microsoft has said at least two other candidates I don't know who those can't we don't know who those candidates are there's also remember the d-triple-c emails that Russia was able to get ahold of for the 2016 election that that haven't really made an appearance quite yet so we'll see what happens with that Evan McMullen Ruth Marcus
