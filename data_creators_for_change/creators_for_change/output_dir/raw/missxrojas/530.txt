fumbling fitting the clumsy helmets just

out and stumbling and floundering like a

drowning if in some smothering dreams

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,449
you too could pace behind the wagon that

28
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,339
we flung him in and watched the white

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,500
eyes writhing in his face his hanging
