1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:01,350
WE LOVE HIM FOR HIS

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,586
CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMERICA, NOT

3
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,687
FOR HIS SUPPORT TO PUTIN.

4
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:09,392
>> Tucker: GREAT TO SEE YOU.

5
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:10,559
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST GLOBAL

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,961
WARMING SEEMS TO HAVE GONE BUST

7
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:13,829
IT STARTED AS AN EFFORT TO

8
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:14,530
PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT IT IS

9
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,669
NOT THAT ANYMORE.

10
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:20,469
DETAILING HOW THE MOVEMENT HAS

11
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:23,773
BEEN HIJACKED BY OBSESSIONS WITH

12
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,374
RACE AND GENDER, WORRIES ABOUT

13
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,576
CARBON AND RISING SEA LEVELS

14
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:28,344
HAVE TURNED INTO SPEECHES ABOUT

15
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:30,980
FIGHTING MISOGYNY AND SO-CALLED

16
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,681
CLIMATE JUSTICE WHATEVER THAT

17
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:33,182
IS.

18
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:34,316
STEVEN HAYWARD JOINS US TO

19
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:34,650
EXPLAIN.

20
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,186
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

21
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:39,588
>> THANK YOU, ISN'T IT AMAZING

22
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:40,923
HOW EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GET

23
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:41,624
REDUCED TO RACE AND JUSTICE

24
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:45,695
THESE DAYS?

25
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,764
>> Tucker: IT'S ESPECIALLY

26
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:50,166
AMAZING WHEN TOPICS THAT HAVE NO

27
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:50,966
CONCEIVABLE CONNECTION GET

28
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,170
PULLED IN, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

29
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,539
>> THE POINT OF THE ARTICLE IS

30
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:57,406
SIMPLE.

31
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,974
MOST ISSUES GO THROUGH THESE

32
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:00,376
LONG CYCLES LOTS OF EARLY

33
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:01,544
INTERESTS, THE PRESS GETS ONTO

34
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:03,779
IT, A FLURRY OF POLITICAL

35
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,181
ACTIVITY, POLICIES ARE MADE,

36
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,348
THEN WE START HAVING

37
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:06,982
CONSIDERATION TRADE-OFFS.

38
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,317
IF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH

39
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,252
GLOBAL WARMING FOR SEVERAL YEARS

40
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:10,786
GLOBAL WARMING FOR SEVERAL YEAR

41
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:11,087
YEARS.

42
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:11,854
IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE TO DO WHAT

43
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:20,396
A LOT OF THE CLIMATISTAS WANT US

44
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:20,696
TO DO.

45
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:24,233
WE NEED TO CONSIDER OF GENDER

46
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:28,104
AND CLIMATE JUSTICE, THAT'S

47
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:32,208
JUMPING THE SHARK.

48
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,008
PUBLIC OPINION SURVEYS SHOWED

49
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,010
DECLINING PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE

50
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,411
DARN THING.

51
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:36,579
>> Tucker: IT'S A BOUTIQUE

52
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,646
ISSUE FOR RICH PEOPLE BUT IT'S

53
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:40,349
ALSO CONFUSING.

54
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,484
EVEN IF YOU THINK THAT CLIMATE

55
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,152
JUSTICE IS REAL OR IF YOU CAN

56
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,453
EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS I'VE NEVER

57
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:46,622
MET ANYONE WHO CAN OR YOU THINK

58
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:47,957
GENDER EQUALITY IS AN IMPORTANT

59
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:49,425
PART OF THIS, WHAT DOES THAT

60
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,359
HAVE TO DO WITH SCIENCE?

61
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,429
THAT'S NOT SCIENCE, IS IT?

62
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:54,563
>> NOT AT ALL.

63
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:55,331
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID

64
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:58,200
IN THE ARTICLE.

65
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,369
I'M NOT QUESTIONING ANY OF THE

66
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,771
CONSENSUS ABOUT CLIMATE SCIENCE

67
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,939
I'M SAYING IS A POLITICAL POLICY

68
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,175
MATTER, IT'S RUN ITS COURSE.

69
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:06,876
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN MY TWITTER

70
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,745
FEED A BLOWUP.

71
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:11,213
APPARENTLY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

72
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:13,949
CALL SOMEONE A CLIMATE DENIER AT

73
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:15,017
ALL, I'M GETTING CALLED A WHITE

74
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:18,254
MALE SUPREMACIST WHICH IS A GOOD

75
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:19,355
SIGN THAT YOU'VE RUN OUT OF

76
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:20,623
ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE ISSUE

77
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:23,159
ITSELF.

78
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,959
>> Tucker: DOESN'T APPROACH

79
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,395
BEING AN ARGUMENT, IT'S A PRIMAL

80
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:27,129
SCREAM.

81
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:28,164
YOU WERE AT A BERKELEY HOW ARE

82
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:29,198
YOU ALLOWED TO SAY THIS AT

83
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:29,565
BERKELEY?

84
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:31,934
AND GOOD FOR YOU FOR BEING THERE

85
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:32,468
AND GOOD FOR YOU FOR BEING THER

86
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:34,336
THERE.

87
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:36,172
>> I'M LIKE THAT CIVIL WAR ERA

88
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,374
GENERAL WHO SAID I LIKE TO FIGHT

89
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:39,008
SURROUNDED, I THINK THAT

90
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:43,145
MIGHT'VE BEEN GENERAL CUSTER.

91
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:44,980
TWO THINGS THAT YOU AND YOUR

92
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,881
AUDIENCE SHOULD KNOW AND BE

93
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,217
ENCOURAGED BY A LITTLE BIT.

94
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:50,286
ONE IS WE OUGHT TO MAKE A

95
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:53,556
DISTINCTION BETWEEN

96
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:54,190
OLD-FASHIONED LIBERALS WHO

97
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,957
DOMINATED UNIVERSITIES FOR

98
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,560
DECADES, THAT'S NOT A NEWS STORY

99
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,594
INCREASINGLY THE UNIVERSITIES

100
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,696
ARE BEING DOMINATED BY MUCH MORE

101
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,698
RADICAL PROGRESSIVE LEFT THAT AS

102
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:03,465
WE KNOW TURN TO VIOLENCE TO GET

103
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,968
THEIR WAY.

104
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,369
A LOT OF THE OLD-FASHIONED

105
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:08,437
LIBERALS UNDERSTAND THIS IS A

106
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:09,405
CRISIS FOR THE UNIVERSITIES AND

107
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:12,141
A LOT OF THEM ARE STARTING TO

108
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,343
SAY, I THINK YOU WANT TO GIVE

109
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,744
PROPS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND

110
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,346
ACADEMICS AT BERKELEY WHO SAID

111
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,548
WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO

112
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:21,150
HAVE SOME MORE CONSERVATIVE

113
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,152
VOICES ON OUR FACULTY AND ON OUR

114
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:23,485
CAMPUS.

115
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:24,553
HE REACHED OUT TO BE A COUPLE

116
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:25,354
YEARS AGO AND INVITED ME TO COME

117
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:27,990
AND I'M GLAD TO BE THERE, I'M

118
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,724
HAVING A GREAT TIME AND I GET

119
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:30,526
ALONG WITH MOST OF THE LIBERALS

120
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:31,694
ON THE CAMPUS JUST FINE AND THE

121
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,562
RADICALS WANT TO GAUGE ME AT

122
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:34,163
ALL.

123
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:35,164
>> Tucker: I THINK THAT'S

124
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,366
IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE

125
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,168
DISTINCTION, IF LIBERALISM IS A

126
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,636
CONCERN FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES, A

127
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:41,437
BELIEF IN ACTUAL DIVERSITY THAT

128
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:42,905
I'M A LIBERAL AND PROUD TO BE

129
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:43,372
ONE.

130
00:03:43,372 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE AREN'T MANY LEFT I'M GLAD
