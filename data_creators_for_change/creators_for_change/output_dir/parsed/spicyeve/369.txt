Branka bees Jackson's a courageous fight
guy it was a day like any other day
ion goat meat and as always I got
dressed
like every morning I made my way into
the kitchen and I grab him up
Coffee not for me milk it does a body
good it was a typical morning but then
what I know I picked it up and it says
ha we have your prized possession give
us what we want or its bye-bye beloved
until we see each other again PS I can't
believe this
who does he think he is he doesn't know
who he's messing with
so I went back inside the house to
figure this whole thing out
there was so much on the line there was
only one thing I could do
juice in hand I glanced up into the sky
and I heard him say orange juice really
is that the best you can do give us some
flavor give us some variety screw it you
know what bro Clavius we're gonna kill
it anyway
what
god I'm depressed at this point all I
could say was screw it before action I
gave myself a quick pep talk from Cuevas
it's all or nothing now we're never do
or die I ran off to meet him once and
for all
I saw him what the hell there's so many
of them but I'm brown babies yes it's
the kill I stare them down no joke I'll
be fight them til I want I would get
back what was mine
i'ma finish this right now
I finished the job but what was I
looking for what was that I heard a
noise and I ran in that direction
I tried to get a better look but it was
my cousin Anquan I untied her and she
said Bronk Levias thank you so much for
saving me I really thought I was a goner
we embraced but then this building will
self-destruct in five four three two
we both made sure that we were okay then
she thanked me for saving her and she
abruptly left
so what's my job done quietly went on my
way
well that's just another regular day on
the way
