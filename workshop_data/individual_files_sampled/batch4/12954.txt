we begin with this video that's now gone viral of a student I guess he's in Tennessee who was bullied at school and he was talking on videos mom's took a tape of him went viral all these celebrities pledged their support I want to talk a little bit about what's happening here why did that boy what what's the point of it why are you taking people and finding a way to make men do y'all okay what did I say to you what they do tell you at lunch Bill Cosby pack up my clothes do nothing is it just you yep where's that other kids change it feel that way say it so they're good shoe how's that make you feel okay okay so they're a couple things about this so number one as someone who is viciously bullied in school I can say that this is what this kids experiencing is is not just real it's like if you've actually been through this experience you you know what this feels like you've been exactly where this kid is I have to say I don't like that the momma took this tape and put it online I don't like that I think that this is a situation where the mom needs to March herself in the principal's office and take care of business or she needs to walk over to the kids houses and take care of business this is something I intend on doing with my own kid if this ever becomes an issue if my kid bullies you know I'm not big on spanking like it's not a thing in my house but if my kid became a bully that would be a time for spanking I really would but you know my father was was the person who went in and took care of business when it came to bullying I think I've told the stories on the show before I don't like embarrassing this kid this kid forever is now going to be associated with being the kid who's cryin over being bullied and yes that brings you some national sympathy and yes a lot of celebrities will come out of the woodwork to talk about how terrible bullying is because it is it is just awful but I think that the only way that we're actually going to solve this problem is not on a national level with celebrities saying things it's gonna be on a parental level with parents going out and doing something about it so I wish that mom had had instead of taking this tape I wish that mom and marched herself over the principal's office and threatened some consequences or went over to the parents houses and threatened some consequences and made sure that this did not happen again I wish that she had gotten this kid fighting lesson so they could kick the crap out of his boys I think that's a better short-term solution than an long-term solution actually then putting tapes like this up online just feel awful for this kid I feel awful for him and everybody's celebrating this how great it's gonna be you know what's gonna happen to this kid six months after after all the celebrities are gone six months after all the celebrities are gone all the celebrities are going back to making their movies and they've gone back to being the beautiful people this kid is gonna get it twice as hard from the rest of the bullies in his class that's how this works it's it's just yeah
