last week we told you about some of the bombshell statements from Donald Trump's former political strategist and notable white supremacist Steve Bannon in the book fire in fury Trump did not like it and he was pissed and so what he wanted to do apparently from reports come out of the White House is get some of his supporters to go to the media and attack Bannen and what that led to was sort of a contest to see who could be most vociferous and they're denouncing of Bannen and most obsequious in their support of the president turned out not to be much of a contest though because someone has already wrote one you're gonna see that in this clip from Steven Miller and CNN's Jake Tapper did any of those people from that meeting meet with President Trump as Bannon says the chance that he didn't - Don Jr didn't walk these demos up to his father's office on the 26th floor is zero can you just settle that for us did President Trump meet with any of the people I have no knowledge of anything to do with that meeting okay but what I can tell you unequivocally is that the allegations and insinuations in this book which are which are a pure work of fiction are nothing but a pile of trash three went through well and well just to finish a because you know your networks been going 24/7 with all the salacious coverage and I know that it brings a lot of you guys a lot of joy they're trying to stick the knife in but the reality is is that page after page after page of the book is pure fault so look the entire thing is made-up although we know it is extremely unlikely that that's the case it's I would say likely I'm about 80% of the way through the book I would imagine that some of it is probably either exaggerated or recalled in a way that's beneficial to the person doing the recalling it is for the most part of book of the dueling factions inside of the White House giving information to this reporter so it seems almost certain that they are presenting things to that reporter in a way that's beneficial to their side but the idea that it's 100% made up when reports are coming out that Donald Trump indeed did is a quote from Sebastian Gorka that he did instruct them to talk with Michael Wolfe so we know those interviews happened well we know that he was told - we don't know that the president told him to talk to him right I believe that I thought that he said when I read the drafts all right it was just that he was instructed to I didn't know that it was Trumpton so the whole thing is garbage according to him but it actually got a far more aggressive as you'll see in this next clip do you think tweets like that help or hurt the cause that the president is stable enough for the job not only do I think they help it but I think in the toxic environment that you've created here in CNN and cable news which is a real crisis of legitimacy for your network and we saw it of course with the extremely fake news you reported about the Don junior and WikiLeaks story there was a huge embarrassment for your network even just like the huge embarrassment you had when you've got the Comey testimony wrong Steven X which a lot of people I'm not getting to the issue of you're furious but the president's the president's tweets absolutely reaffirmed the plain spoken truth a self-made billionaire revolutionize reality TV and tapped into something magical that's happening in the hearts of this country the people that you don't has approval rating of 30s I don't know the people that you don't connect with and understand the people whose manufacturing jobs have left who've been besieged by high crime communities and who've been affected by a policy of uncontrolled immigration those voices those experiences don't get covered on this network that's why the I mean it to prove the point I was I was booked to talk about the very issues I'm just describing you're not even asking about him because they're not interesting facts to you that's not true I have a plenty of questions in there Grayson you assume that the filibuster by talking about your flight no question because don't know nobody kind of sent I'm Jay Jay even Jay pray reason in the White House reason why the president reason why I want to talk about the president's experiences what I've seen with him traveling to meet dozens of foreign leaders with his incredible work okay you know the questions I understand you have 24 hours a day of antiva material you're not gonna give three minutes for the American people gather the real experience one viewer that you care about right now and you're being obsequious are being a Fanta Odom and release him okay and I've wasted enough of my viewers like you know as Republicans lawmakers have sessions to resign in a major reversal Democrats are now coming to his defense what changed well I got exciting at the end yeah yeah by the way watching him I'm sure many of you does different ways to verbalize this but it seemed like I've never seen anyone attacked someone so much but look so bored while doing it right he looks and and this is just based on how he looks I don't know or necessarily even think it's true but he looks kind of sedated throughout that even though he's so aggressive like his eyes he's got the sad eyes like he's not moving his face much he's just kind of like talking as quickly as he can in a monotonous way yeah he's do I mean he's described in the book as being not nearly as bright as he apparently thinks that he is I mean he's smart enough to go on the show and do what Jake Tapper is described and clearly he's I mean look a lot of the guests that will go on a show like that will talk to advance a narrative to present like an idea of what needs to happen in this country which can be entirely deceitful but at least he sort of get the goal but he is going on there as Jake Tapper describes literally to lie to please one person resident and that I've never lived in a third world dictatorship but it feels like the sort of thing that you'd find there where it's currying favor with the Dear Leader and not caring about anything else I mean Steve Miller like pretending that he's the voice for disaffected and disillusioned America that seems a little bit hard to buy and to back up the thesis from Jake Tapper this tweet went out immediately after from Donald Trump Jake Tapper a fake news CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump administration watch the hatred and unfairness of his CNN flunky and because you can't have a Donald Trump tweet without projection Stephen Miller is literally acting as a flunky interview right and that's what he is - I mean his job before this was he was communications director for Jeff Sessions and before that he had the same honor of holding that job for a former representative Michele Bachmann so it the whole idea that he's new to this or that he has not been the sort of sycophant kind of communications figure before is ludicrous until your point john james Fallows yesterday in the levitt letter is a great writer he said in decades of seeing White House aides on TV I can think of nothing remotely like the tone or effect that Stephen Miller has chosen even the test iasts Pat Buchanan Jody Powell would with Jimmy Carter John Sununu with George Bush all testy people James Carville usually famed affability went on screen feigned affability this guy came in almost memorizing copy playing to that one person yeah she said the line revolutionized reality TV twice before the show we pointed out that I look I didn't watch The Apprentice but I understand the basic premise is he brought in people they competed in a series of competitions and then we're steadily voted off the show I'm not a historian of TV it doesn't seem like a revolution or if it was it didn't start with The Apprentice oh yeah it wasn't a Renaissance he just carried it but he has to say those things he has to call them a genius because he's trying to appeal purely to the president so it's it's actually a pretty that whole appearance by Stephen Miller was pretty ironic because the whole point of him being on there was to essentially speak out against the book or you know the the truthfulness of the book and he's just reinforcing what the books main thesis is right that Trump is this person who needs to be surrounded by individuals who to his face will tell him how great he is and how right he is but behind his back you know they they have all sorts of insults regarding you know his his mental capability his intelligence his fitness for office all of that stuff I mean he's just literally sitting there saying all of these great things about Trump that can't be backed up and he got so incredibly offended when Jake Tapper you know accused him of trying to please Trump or you know speak to his audience of one when Trump's tweet proves that's exactly what happened Trump was sitting there by the way he's sitting there watching a CNN segment he's the President of the United States sitting there watching Stephen Miller's performance and then immediately tweeting about how you destroyed Jake Tapper which right also here is a Camp David with congressional leaders right so everybody stopped doing what we came here to do so we can watch Stephen Miller on Jake Tapper talk really nice things about me I'm sorry I'm gonna I'm gonna read one more of tweet from Jim fallows cuz it's important the obvious difference would seem to be that all the rest were conscious of playing to larger audiences the public congressional foes and allies the DC opinion machine where it mattered they seemed likeable Miller doesn't does appear as tapper said to have one person one audience in mind and that's that's unusual that this happens this way and it's wide tappers reaction to it I thought was so strong yeah and and so you might think so look obviously this is disconcerting but why why why have this been a first story we talked about the show but I think it does matter that if you if you analyze based on our experience watching Donald Trump but also the information given in the book this is a person who desperately wants to be liked and is predominantly influenced by the last person he talked to which means that at least hypothetically if he was surrounded by the right sort of people who could manage the worst impulses of him is psychological and mental deficiencies then perhaps he could be pushing away that he's never gonna be a good person he's ever gonna be a good president but maybe you could get a little bit of legislation that would help this country we do have problems that could could use some fixing but if he is continuing to surround himself even after the ouster of Steve van and by people like Steven Miller then it's unlikely that that's going to happen his need to be liked and his need to lash out at the media that he wishes loved him into his second year of his presidency is is the driving force of this presidency right now and so if you have any hope for anything positive happening coming out of the White House before the next election this is pretty good reason to believe that's not going to happen right and I just want to make one more point about you know again the main thesis of that book which is that he's surrounded by people who think that he's an idiot but they won't tell him to his face keep in mind that this White House this administration has had one major problem from the very beginning which is people within the White House constantly leaking things to the media to prove how incredibly incapable Trump is of doing this job properly right why do you think these leaks are coming out they're coming out from White House staffers and so look there might be hyperbole in the book there might be some moments where the writer embellishes stories I don't know exactly where or when he does that but nonetheless I think the main point of the book reinforces something that we already knew about Trump and his administration and again this is a last little thing first of all one thing I remember being on the campaign trail watching TV and seeing Stephen Bennett of Steve Steven Miller interviewed somebody asked him when he became a conservative he became a conservative after reading a book by Wayne LaPierre of the of the National Rifle Association that's how he became yeah what wake of wayne lapierre robo the other thing and you when I talked about it a little bit Johnny before the show the the the whole idea that he says or maybe it was during the the video that he says he didn't know anything about this meeting right come on he even has said who was and wasn't there yeah so Jake Tapper is telling him about the meeting he knew nothing about it well Jake thanks for letting me know that that mean and somewhat tangential I guess but just a pet peeve of mine I mean I I sort of hinted at this when we were first talking about fire and fury last week America clearly doesn't read enough I think we can all agree on that people who are supposed to know a lot people who comment on politics people working in politics often don't know what they're talking about so it's a pet peeve of mine that while Jake Tapper overall did a good job there does anyone watching this video believe that Stephen Miller read the book I think there's zero chance that he read it and yet he goes on there and says that every word is garbage if you want to make him look like I mean I know there's no way you can make him look like a fool in front of the President or in front of Trump's ardent supporters because they don't care about books or what's in them or what's not in them but have him demonstrate that he actually read the book first right America needs to read more depth of expertise in this country the anti intellectual turn I mean I know that we've largely been historically an anti-intellectual country but it's it's spreading I I'm excited the people are reading that's basic no it was you I think cuz been called and said John iadarola said the best thing he said at least this is getting people to read or we're talking about a book we had we also got a beer sponsorship at it that's true that is right to it we've um I mean you can basically we had Harry Potter Fifty Shades of Grey and now this book and I'm worried that there's nothing coming after it but I can recommend some good books if you'd like something to read if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where
