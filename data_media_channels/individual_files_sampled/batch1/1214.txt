the US Navy says its second fleet will be back in commission this summer operating out of Norfolk Virginia the fleet which was eliminated in a cost-cutting move seven years ago is being re-established to counter what the Pentagon calls a rising threat from Russia at a ceremony in Norfolk on Friday Admiral John Richardson Chief of Naval Operations said our national defense makes it clear that we are back in an era of great power competition as the security environment continues to grow more challenging and complex Russia's Navy has stepped up patrols in the Atlantic and both Russia and NATO have been building up forces in Eastern Europe at levels not seen in decades while Russia has fewer ships than it did during the height of the Cold War US officials are especially concerned about its expanded submarine fleet and increase presence in the Atlantic Ocean but one military expert sees this more as saber-rattling than an outright threat of war I think what the Russians will do is probably over time react with more submarines operating in the Atlantic more messages to us that beware but I think that this will be kept at a relatively low level and I really don't see a huge escalation or any escalation proceeding from these actions the u.s. 2nd fleet will be responsible for an area extending halfway across the Atlantic and will include a staff of more than 200 Dyan Estabrook al Jazeera
