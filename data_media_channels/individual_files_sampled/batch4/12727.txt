well now it's time for my smart glasses and the final thought endless think pieces have spilt ink over the question of president Trump's tweeting it occasionally undercuts his policy priorities contradicts his cabinet members and campaign surrogates even occasionally raises the prospect of legal trouble but hurricane Harvey exposes all those worries for mere trifles president Trump's attention to the natural disaster and more importantly coordination with local and state first responders has been a table and admirably but we should remember that President Bush comported himself relatively well during Hurricane Katrina as well despite the utterly failed response of local governments in a barrage of unfair negative press the difference today is that president Trump's side steps the mainstream media to speak directly to the American people and show them what he and his administration are doing without the filter of Democrat operatives who masquerade as journalists that direct communication has even made the mainstream media in this case bend the knee and admit that the president is doing well miracles abound so keep tweeting mr. president and you said it once I'll say it again and again and again despite the constant negative press cough fa I'm Michael Moses the Mike O'Connell show come back tomorrow we'll do it all again
