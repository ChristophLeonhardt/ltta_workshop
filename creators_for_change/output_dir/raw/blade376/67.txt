from the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> of America I have</font>

10 main thoughts on this issue that I

would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explore with you right now</font>

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,890
so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start things off I'd like to talk</font>

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,900
about the evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Assad using</font>

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,060
chemical weapons are we convinced that

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,759
concrete evidence exists because US

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,500
Secretary of State John Kerry seems to

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,530
think so in his speeches and television

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,570
interviews he says we know that the

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,570
Syrian regime maintains custody of these

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,360
chemical weapons we know that the Syrian

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,210
regime has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capacity to do this with</font>

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,879
rockets it's certain that the regime has

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,489
been determined<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clear the opposition</font>

evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> chemical weapons have been</font>

23

why don't the US government show it to

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,290
the UN instead we have witnessed an

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,509
eagerness for military intervention

definitely not this and I'd certainly be

during these discussions about Syria is

<font color="#CCCCCC">four hundred and fifty thousand dollars</font>

208
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,069
and one and a half million dollars

209
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,849
consider what humanitarian help could be

210
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">provided for that amount of money during</font>

because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is I think</font>

that's a false choice and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>
