so NCAA vault what is it the NCAA vault is basically attached ncaa.com which the NCAA's web primary website for championships and the vault essentially is a video platform in which we've taken 150 games from the last decade from the NCAA division women's basketball tournament and open them up to the public you can access those games free of charge you can jump into the games at any point in time and those games are from the sweet 16 of the tournament through the championship game so it's a really interesting piece in which we've enabled consumers to come in and look at the archive and open it up to there to there like and they can they can work with it and it's not just a raw you know several hours of live games it's every moment is indexed and there's metadata so you could look for a specific shot a specific moment and then link directly to that yes it's really a new publishing model when it comes to video in broadband so effectively we've indexed every play every stat every player for the sweet 16 championship game or sweet 16 games all the way to the championship for the last decade so we've enabled it to where every moment is already pre identified but we've also made it into our players so that if the consumer can't find didn't see what they were looking for they can instantly hit you know and create their own moment and post it into facebook twitter and other social mediums as well and what's the point of breaking the game into moments like this as opposed to just chunking it up into plays the way youtube might what we found over time is that people consume video online not so much on a on a full game basis but on a moment basis people want to be able to instantly jump into a full game and they instantly want to be able to go across any given moment that's relevant to them if they just want to come in and get a dunk they can actually look at each individual gunk from each individual player and they'll spend time breaking the game down and consuming what they want rather than having to watch a two-hour make a two-hour commitment into a game so it's all about just more viewership more dwell time and getting consumers specific relevance based on their so they can spend their time more effectively so obviously a lot of college students would watch something like this a huge endemic audience there but who else is a site like this for I think not only the college audience but also the media can use it as well I mean if you go back and if the media is writing a story and they're comparing a game from 2003 to a game in this year's tournament and they want to talk to a moment they can easily go in and link right into the vault that the exact moment that they're describing in the story they can post a link boom takes the consumer right into the vault and the media thing can show the example of exactly what they're trying to describe in the written article so if you're a sports blogger you don't have to hope that an old game is archived on YouTube and then tell someone go to minute five second three it's something you could send a specific link to that moment directly from your site to theirs absolutely i think we already seeing that there's some that's already out there this was out in the soft launch last week and it's just kind of virally taking off and bloggers are already starting to do that it's great so one thing you're going to hear a lot of complaints about is you can't right now embed videos what's what's kind of in the future of the platform what are some things you're going to add to it so we'll add the full screen capability right now it's it's designed for actually the consumption putting more metadata around it so we'll add the fullscreen player and we'll also make it to her eventually we'll add the the embeddable side of it right now though people the consumer web people are really excited about is that they actually don't have to come in and search and wait anymore so the speed of the player is actually extremely fast the consumers are very happy because it connects directly into their facebook and twitter you know commenting sections so because a lot of its connected to the social medium player embeds aren't necessarily is relevant for this first phase but as it gets more into the blogger space and to the publishing space that's something that will do for phase two so some sports leagues have done a nice job with mobile and the ipad is coming out and these are both platforms where flash is not part of them and your site right now is built in flash can you going forward serve more platforms yeah so everything in our particular system today it is flash-based however every given moment is actually broken down and is that addressable so it is an indexable kind of URL if you will so even though there's a consumer front in this flash base the entire back end of our platform allows for the push to all the other platforms as well literally all the way to the live broad asked if we want so it's a very flexible dynamic system and will support those particular pieces again our focus was simply on getting the social context out because that's really where social context meets the archive is how the rights and the value is starting to really develop out of these collections so Greg you are not a TV network you're not even a for-profit company what's the whole point of the NCAA taking all this footage turning into a site and hoping that people would go there sure a couple things number one is we're trying to provide value back to the site of ncaa.com and the rights holder in that case which is CBS CBS has the opportunity but working with them they're the ones that are physically going out and selling the NCA bolt so in conjunction with thought equity what we're providing is a unique asset for NCAA com to hopefully help CBS and continue to drive the value of the site the same time also trying to open up the NCAA basketball and help promote the NCAA brand through the vault I mean to have all those games available and people can easily access them it's not a closed where people can't find it now let's it's open to anybody and it's just it's a great way to promote the game so you talk of this is kind of a pilot project what makes you happy what's a successful pilot for you in terms of readers or viewers or video streamed or something like that sure last March NCAA com had about 15 million unique visitors and that takes into account March Madness on the man which is the live component of where all 63 games from the first round on or streamed live from the tournament we for success for this would look to have somewhere between the million and the million five range for the NCAA of all along so about ten to fifteen percent of that traffic for just the in cville we had that I think it would be a huge looks each student looked at one video if you look at one video for ten minutes we need we need to make sure they're looking at it for a while that would be great with the ability to do a lot of stuff on the web now and and run your own ship is this is this a future beyond CBS or is that taking it too far that may be taking a 24 I think what we're trying to do is open up and be on the forefront in terms of people accessing content and eventually we would love to open up our entire archive and includes 23 sports 88 championships and to have any student-athlete whether it be the student athletes that competed in the division three volleyball championship go in and see their content and their name linked into their stats and be able to find their place that's like a dream there's a long way to get there and this is just kind of the beginning of it we hope that this month will prove that this content does have value and we continue to build it out and include those other sports
