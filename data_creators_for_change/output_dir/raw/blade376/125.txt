reason most people come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to youtube is</font>

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,819
for some light-hearted content and for

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,010
some randomness and to be honest my

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,349
channel hasn't quite met the annual

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,509

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,739
pelicans have an imagination to what

19
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:01,940
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought so</font>

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,799
yeah that's right I have mind-reading

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,269
powers as well what you're gonna do

22
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I thought so when it comes to</font>

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,840
being random it does show a sense of

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,729
creativity unless of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> your random</font>

25
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:13,430
acts were intensively planned I could

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,659
say I was attacked by a tiger yeah

27
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:23,020
that's not random enough mmm attacked by

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,080
attacked by yes that's attacked by a

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,850
tiger yeah once I know if you're truly

30
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,220
random stand up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine there is a</font>

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,290
box on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor in front of you now be</font>

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,420
sure to record yourself doing this but

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,040
pretend you're reaching in the box and

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,410
throwing out items that are inside it

35
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,600
but say out loud what the items are the

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,850
aim of this is to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> each item</font>

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shout out is completely</font>

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,780
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unrelated to the previous</font>

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,420
one so instead of going jacket trousers

40
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,780
shoes you'd say something like bicycle

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,820
cupcake plumber it's harder than you

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,710
think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to record yourself and be</font>

43
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,060
sure to post it as a video response to

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,759
this video<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i D like being random</font>

45
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,830
and crazy from time to time and doing

46
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,570
funny videos but only when i'm in the

47
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">mood but as many of you know the main</font>

48
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,950
reason i make youtube videos is to try

49
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and inspire other</font>

people in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past couple of years I've</font>

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,670
been intensively researching into what's

52
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,350
going on in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess as a</font>

53
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,090
result of that in a way I've kind of

54
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,920
lost my innocence and the whole concept

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of me losing my naivety about this world</font>
