defend Hong Kong the theme for this year's rally those taking part say the protest has particular resonance after a year when people's rights were violated repeatedly yes we are very concerned about this version because we see there detoriation in the rule of law in Hong Kong so we believe we should stand here to protest their future the various posters depict their grievances they are protesting against the jailing of three young pro democracy student leaders they're also condemning a change in Legislative Council procedures that would enable the government to push through unpopular loss without opposition and they are angry at a plan that could for the first time allow mainland Chinese law enforcement officials to operate on Hong Kong soil I'm afraid that Hong Kong Hong Kong becomes another part of China which is strictly monitored by the government and there isn't any freedom they were not very freedom so I want all God freedom prints so I come out a March like this would be unthinkable elsewhere in China where the government cracks down harshly in any kind of dissent but the new security laws proposed and likely to be implemented next year many fear that they will not be able to express their anger or criticise the government so openly in the future but there are those who feel Beijing has Hong Kong's best interests at heart dozens of people held their own rally holding up Hong Kong and China flags they say there represents many in the city who would rather stay out of politics people like Susan Kwan who has been running this tofu shop for 45 years business is brisk on the first day of 2018 for this 64 year old she's as Hong Kong people have a lot of freedom and democracy shouldn't be a priority don't worry I got it yeah China is a very strong country we shouldn't upset them if you haven't done anything wrong there's no need to be scared of the Chinese government the rally ends at Civic Square with protesters surrounded by police they are defiant almost euphoric to be here in front of the government offices which had been closed to the public for nearly three years this is where the landmark 2014 pro-democracy Occupy movement began and this is where in the past activists have held rallies and won against the government they hope it's a sign the 2018 will be a year when the government will listen to their concerns the VGO palin al jazeera Hong Kong
