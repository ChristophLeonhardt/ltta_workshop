1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,329
Months after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico
is still in peril.

2
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,640
Huge swathes of the island are still without
power, running water or access to medical care.

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,960
Experts estimate that it would take years
before these services are restored island-wide.

4
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,740
Much of the blame has been placed on FEMA
for a slow response in comparison to recent

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,620
disasters on the mainland, but recovery from a disaster of this complexity and scale has

6
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,900
proven more challenging than anyone anticipated, and filling the gaps between an over-extended

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,860
public sector and a suffering populace falls on private citizens.

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,460
Robert Anderson is a Puerto Rico resident
of four years.

9
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,400
The eye of the storm came in south of El Yunque,
swept up toward San Juan, and out to Arecibo.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,299
Everything on the right-hand side is what
we call the dirty side of the storm.

11
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,610
This isn't his first time in a disaster zone.

12
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,010
With a military and telecom background, Anderson worked on repairing damaged cell phone towers

13
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,240
in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,040
Some might be tempted to label him a disaster capitalist, seeking lucrative government contracts

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,260
for his expertise. But as Anderson finds himself in the middle of the humanitarian crisis,

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,880
he and his associates are developing a variety
of pro bono recovery projects that target

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,880
the island's hardest hit areas.

18
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,200
I see two Puerto Ricos.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
We're here in San Juan.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,060
They have telecommunications restored.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,470
They may or may not have power, but basic
services are in place.

22
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,240
They're able to get food. They're able to buy things.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,960
They're surviving.

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,880
And when you look outside of the San Juan area,
you can go 15 minutes from here and find areas

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,160
that are devastated.

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,060
I'm working on the devastated side.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,040
Today, he's put together a boots-on-the-ground
mission to provide medical care to some of

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,340
the island's most isolated and vulnerable
residents.

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,220
Steve Birmbaum is one of Anderson's business associates.

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,080
He offered an extra car and a set of hands.

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,700
So we received an initial report from a nurse that was out in the area.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,560
We're headed to the Northeast region of Utuado
for some people that are in need of urgent

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,780
medical assistance.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,580
Dr. Sally Priester is a physician from San Juan.

35
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,661
She filled a van with medical supplies at
her own expense and brought along a team of nurses.

36
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,200
Google Maps estimated our first destination
to be a 90-minute drive,

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,240
but it didn't account for obstacles like this.

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,620
Our first stop was the home of an 82-year-old,
blind Vietnam Veteran.

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,320
His roof was blown off by the storm and he's
been living alone in a back shed for nearly two months.

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,140
His cane actually got broken in the storm
so he's limited mobility.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
He has a number of medical ailments.

42
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
Dr. Priester's having a look at him.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,940
We called the VA. They're going to get him set up with what he needs, get him stabilized so he can

44
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,640
then be transported either to an evacuation
center or off the island.

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
It's when the chain gets broken when those
families that are connected to them leave

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,920
the island or take off, these guys get left
at the end of the road and it's tough.

47
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:38,600
FEMA was not officially part of Robert's team
and their arrival caught everyone by surprise.

48
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,720
Their job here was to survey and report back
to their superiors and did not come with medical

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,609
aid of any kind.

50
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,100
People think that FEMA is there to hand out
bottles of water and that's not what they do.

51
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,100
FEMA has a role to play. They have a very specific role.

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,099
They bring in ships.

53
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,099
They bring in airplanes.

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,529
They bring in tractor trailers with pallets
of things, but they're a big machine and there's

55
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:03,120
gaps in that thing and you're seeing one of the gaps here, and we help fill that role.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,460
These guys were in a bad situation before
and now they're struggling for real basic things.

57
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,860
One of the risks that you run is people going
from fear to hopelessness.

58
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,660
Those are the folks that we're trying to reach.

59
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,670
How are they reached?

60
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,670
How are they even found?

61
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,060
Word of mouth mostly.

62
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,400
What's your role in all this?

63
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,580
Ghost in the machine.

64
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,970
I'm lucky enough to be able to communicate
with folks in FEMA, the state of Puerto Rico.

65
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,180
For a ghost, Robert makes his presence well known.

66
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,300
Not only was he the de facto leader of the mission,

67
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,000
now with FEMA in tow, he created his own maps to survey storm damage.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,060
We're right here.

69
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,080
And delivered them to FEMA HQ free of charge.

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,379
I have pretty good reach.

71
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,260
Perhaps that's how he managed to earn himself a coveted FEMA badge without actually working for them.

72
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,720
And its these relationships that
allow him to operate more efficiently than

73
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,750
an NGO or a government agency.

74
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,280
We're able to resolve problems at a different level.

75
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,020
That's where they are right here.

76
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,460
Our next stop was on a mountain top, a family of 11, struggling to care for their special

77
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,880
needs brother in what was left of their house.

78
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,660
Probably we are the first health team to come
and visit this family.

79
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,720
The patient has Down Syndrome.

80
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,610
He is all day in bed.

81
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,120
The difficulty with this is the patient cannot be alone.

82
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,480
The most important thing is that you need
to take care of the chronic disease beside

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,960
the disability because they have been not
going to a doctor and a doctor has not coming here yet.

84
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,580
So we need a refill of this medication.

85
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,520
After maybe 54 days, it's not getting better.

86
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,020
The only way that you can be able to see that
is coming to the ground, drive and see the

87
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,520
people and talk to the people.

88
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
You could see San Juan from here,

89
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,000
but you can't get there.

90
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
It's like the Emerald City.

91
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,180
On this stop, we caught word that a man living alone at the edge of a jungle was in need of care.

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,180
We decided to take a little detour, come up
here and check out and see what's going on.

93
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,880
One of the challenges is to find those people that are

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,680
at the end of these roads that need help.

95
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm asking about why he's alone right here.

96
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,560
He says "life happens. I'm here by myself."

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,240
This is not a job.

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,240
If you do this, you need to have passion for
what you can do.

99
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,789
You're not going to get paid.

100
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,640
It's said in disaster response, in emergency response that the real first responders are your neighbors.

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,560
You don't need to wait for a lucrative FEMA contract to go out and do good and to help the community.

102
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,920
In the end, do you feel like you're making
a difference?

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,880
The lives you touch, the people that you can
affect. I don't really think about it in those terms.

104
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,600
But why do you do it?

105
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,360
It helps me sleep at night.

106
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,139
I think it's as much for the people that are
going out to help and do things than it is

107
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:44,320
for the people that you affect.

108
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,270
Whether out of altruism or the lure of a paid
gig or some mixture of the two, Anderson hopes

109
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,240
to stay here to help shape Puerto Rico's future.

110
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,600
Puerto Rico's essentially been a colony for
400 years.

111
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,560
It was treated poorly by the Spanish.

112
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,240
It was not treated well by the United States when they first got here.

113
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,680
Puerto Rico can continue in the way that it's
always been or Puerto Rico can rebuild itself

114
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,360
like nothing that it's ever been.

115
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,280
and we have to do everything we can to make that real.

116
00:08:19,280 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the bottom line.
