I'm Katie Hopkins I'm in London today but I'm just about to travel to a country that is spilling over with violence and tension between black and white I'm going to South Africa to cover the racial war by black extremists who are systematically murdering white farmers have you heard of it I'd be surprised if you have because it's not something the mainstream media want to talk about they only have one narrative for South Africa that whites are racist who enforced apartheid and of course apartheid ended more than 25 years ago and that's a good thing but today's extreme anti-white racism and sadistic violence against these farmers is just pure evil and no one wants to talk about it the mainstream media like CNN and BBC turn the other way so I'm gonna go I want to document the ethnic cleansing of white farmers and I want to find out what the real story is what's really going on here is it just random violence or is there a more political motivation behind all this I want to talk to the victims and hear their stories and also to the perpetrators to if I can so I'm going to South Africa for nearly two weeks to find the facts and bring them to you with written columns and daily reports from inside in-country and you'll be able to see exactly what's going on at my new website Hopkins WorldCom and when we come back I'll be making the first full documentary on this topic the first one of its kind obviously is dangerous nearly 20,000 murders last year and as many attempted murders carjacking racial violence attacks on schools attacks on shopping malls you'll have seen them recently in the news but the attacks on white farmers have a military style to them it really is like a civil war so we have to be careful it's the one thing a thousand South Africans are telling me that have heard about my trip and I'm going to be careful and going with a cameraman but I'm also going with an expert in security in hostile terrain and we'll be joined in location by another security team of experts say s guys so they'll be with us we have two vehicles as well and one of the drivers is a paramedic the situation in country is tense not many people appear to be prepared to go there at all and when we get out to these farms will truly be in no-man's land there is no one to call for help but I want to feel what it's like to be a white farmer at night on these farms under threat but we need to be safe this kind of security is expensive so we're saving money where we can we've managed to find some flights for a thousand US dollars each for me my cameraman and my security and our hotel rooms are about a hundred dollars each a night for us we'll probably spend close to about a thousand pounds on the road we're going to keep expenses as low as we can and we're renting documentary quality filming equipment because it's the story that matters I really don't care how uncomfortable I am but by far the biggest expense that we face is the cost of our security operation the whole team including the medic and the vehicles is sixteen thousand British pounds that's more than 23 thousand US dollars one thousand five hundred dollars a day but without it I'm told we won't get out of there alive our total costs for this trip three plane tickets two vehicles meals hotel and security is more than 30 thousand US dollars that's 21,000 British pounds CNN probably spends more than that on wolf blitzer's makeup budget I imagine and it's a rounding error for our BBC they get about five billion pounds ago from the government but for us $30,000 is a lot of money not one dollar of this not one pound will be for me and we won't be wasting money on the road it's all just to cover the costs of getting this story out to you and if we raise any extra it will go forward to future missions if you can help us please do click here or go to Hopkins WorldCom I promise to tell you a story you won't hear in any of the mainstream media I promise to bring you the truths that aren't being told let me be your eyes and your ears in South Africa I'll give you a daily report directly to you know mainstream media filter please click here to help cover our costs and join me in South Africa at Hopkins WorldCom you
