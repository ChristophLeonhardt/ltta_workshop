Mount of Olives
Jerusalem, IsraelThis mountain has been a
Jewish cemetery for over 3,000 years and contains
150,000 bodies.Jews believe that those buried
in Jerusalem will be resurrected first when
the Messiah comes.But Jerusalemâ€™s cemeteries
are running out of space for new bodies.Israel
plans to drill catacombs into a nearby mountain
cemetery, adding 22,000 burial plots.
Overcrowding may mean the end of traditional
graves in Jerusalem.
