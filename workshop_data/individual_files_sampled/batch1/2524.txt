because I've run four times and if you've run as a third party and I've run in 50 states every time only can it run in 50 states you got to respect all the people not just blue state red state I think I made my point that if the media does not cover a third-party candidate it doesn't matter how well-known the candidate is unless they're billionaires it doesn't matter how many arenas the candidate fills like I filled Madison Square Garden arenas all over the country in two thousand if people don't know you're running you don't have a chance to break five percent and unless the media has a higher estimate of its own significance in terms of the right of people to know and have voices and choices unless you're a multi-billionaire they're going to be third party candidates Mark Cuban already has his eye unless you do that there's no voices and choices from ordinary people trying to improve this country through the electoral process
