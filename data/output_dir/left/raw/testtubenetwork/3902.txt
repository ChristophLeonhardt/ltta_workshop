1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,950
Cambodia just had a major election, but there
wasn’t much suspense involved.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,730
The outcome, as expected, was declared a win
for authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen,

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,489
who has been in power for over 33 years.

4
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:19,560
This was the 6th general election since the
UN sponsored the country’s free and fair

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,859
vote in 1993, but some analysts say that the
more elections that have been held, the more

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,650
authoritarian the country has become.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,570
Journalists and human rights groups say Cambodia
is sliding into a full-fledged dictatorship.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,829
And we spoke to an expert on authoritarian
regimes and democratization in Southeast Asia

9
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,850
who says the country is already there.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,399
Hi guys, I’m Versha, this is NowThis World,
and on this episode we’re exploring the

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,410
question: how did Cambodia get here?

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,890
Before we look at these latest elections,
we need to understand who Hun Sen is.

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,871
The world’s longest currently-serving Prime
Minister first came to power in 1985, but

14
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:02,920
was a political figure in the country years
before that.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,050
A series of twists and turns in the Cambodian
power structure eventually landed him in the

16
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,360
right place at the right time.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,700
In the early ‘70s, a young Hun Sen joined
the forces of the communist insurgency movement,

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,090
the Khmer Rouge, and quickly moved up the
ranks to commander, leading hundreds and thousands

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,311
of men in military offenses against the pro-U.S.
Khmer Republic in the years leading up to

20
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:31,400
the Khmer Rouge’s takeover of the capital
city, Phnom Penh.

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,240
Cambodia then spent four years in the mid-‘70s,
embroiled in the Khmer Rouge regime, whose

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,850
brutal crackdowns resulted in the deaths of
an estimated two million people, including

23
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,120
hundreds of thousands of mostly-Muslim Cham
people.This is considered to be one of the

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,240
worst mass killings of the 20th century.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,950
Hun Sen has denied taking part in the human
rights abuses committed by the Khmer Rouge.

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,810
He defected to Vietnam in 1977, allegedly
out of fear of retribution from the government

27
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,460
for not taking part in the mass killings.

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:10,288
Vietnam invaded Cambodia two years later,
overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime and instituted

29
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,480
a new government, the People’s Republic
of Kampuchea, or PRK.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,879
Hun Sen’s connection and perceived loyalty
to Vietnam led to his appointment as foreign

31
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,840
minister in the PRK, and then, by age 32,
Prime Minister.

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,040
But under the police state of the Communist
PRK, human rights abuses continued.

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,370
Security forces suppressed opposition groups
and tortured and interrogated detainees.

34
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,930
Lee Morgenbesser, whose research examines
flawed elections and dictators in Southeast

35
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,140
Asia, broke it down for us.

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,719
“You had four warring factions, you had
an outbreak of disease, poverty, starvation,

37
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,700
a lot of very terrible conditions.”

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,170
Eventually, the international community stepped
in to oversee a peace agreement, with the

39
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,630
goal of setting Cambodia on a path to democracy.

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,810
This led to the 1993 so-called ‘free and
fair’ elections.

41
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,230
Those elections didn’t turn out so well
for Hun Sen.

42
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,629
His party, the Cambodian People’s Party,
or CPP, didn’t win the majority of seats.

43
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:19,780
But he refused to accept the result, and forced
a negotiation with the Funcinpec Party to

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,659
become second Prime Minister.

45
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,529
In 1997, he orchestrated a coup to consolidate
power, and has single-handedly ruled as PM

46
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:29,860
ever since.

47
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,170
His official title in Khmer translates to
‘princely exalted supreme great commander

48
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,749
of gloriously victorious troops.’

49
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:42,889
And starting in 2016, all media were ordered
to use this full title.

50
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:48,200
As it stands, Transparency International ranks
Cambodia the third most corrupt country in

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Asia.

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,989
But how could a country with constitution-mandated
general elections every five years be so corrupt?

53
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,689
It has a lot to do with who’s running in
them.

54
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:03,499
Though no fewer than 20 registered parties
competed in the recent election, it’s wasn’t

55
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:05,439
really a competition.

56
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,319
Hun Sen has denied this, but these parties
are known locally as ‘firefly’ parties

57
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,430
for a reason.

58
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,790
They pop up briefly during election season,
then fade away again.

59
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,380
Many of these parties have been accused of
ties to the government, or even being completely

60
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,660
fabricated.

61
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,120
Besides which, they have no time to develop
infrastructure to mobilize supporters.

62
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,950
“You’ve got a party that’s been in power
since 1979 competing against 20 minor parties

63
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:40,530
that have no significance, no influence on
the political dynamics of the country, most

64
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,250
of them don’t even have a national presence.”

65
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,910
“They promote the idea of competition without
the substance of it.”

66
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,000
He says the government is still using elections
to uphold the facade of democracy, to help

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,240
Cambodia make a case for foreign aid, foreign
direct investment, and membership in international

68
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
organizations.

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,770
But Hun Sen’s party essentially eliminated
the only real opposition in November 2017

70
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,600
and imprisoned or exiled its leaders.

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,370
Many speculate that the party’s surprising
success in the 2013 election was the driving

72
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,260
force behind this.

73
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,000
But even if these ‘firefly’ parties were
well-established with adequate resources,

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,570
the actual process of voting still looks like
this:

75
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,110
“Widespread irregularities with the elections,
such as vote-buying, voter intimidation.”

76
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,120
“Literally handing out cash.

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,870
Literally teaching people how to tick the
box for the Cambodia People’s Party.”

78
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,571
Even if opposition groups exist, it’s difficult
for them to speak out without fear of retribution.

79
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:46,750
A recently-enacted lese-majeste law forbids
people from insulting the monarchy, or risk

80
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,130
facing a fine and years of prison time.

81
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,030
And pressure from international bodies isn’t
as strong as it has been historically.

82
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,200
Though the White House has recently reduced
its financial assistance to Cambodia over

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,380
concerns about
‘setbacks to democracy,’ the current stakes

84
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,810
aren’t too high for the country.

85
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:12,940
“You have China backing Cambodia and the
government, and then you have Donald Trump

86
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,400
in the White House who, quite frankly, doesn’t
seem to care about the promotion of democracy

87
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
and security of human rights in Southeast
Asia.”

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,650
And in the past year, the crackdown on human
rights has escalated.

89
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,370
In addition to eliminating the major opposition
party, major independent newspapers have been

90
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,900
forced to close, in order to silence critical
reporting.

91
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,330
So, now that the CPP has taken another victory,
what’s next for Hun Sen and the country?

92
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,520
Hun Sen has committed to staying Prime Minister
for at least another decade, and he’s also

93
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,560
been grooming his sons to take over when the
time comes.

94
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,020
But as the younger, more educated generation
grows increasingly disillusioned with Hun

95
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:12,090
Sen’s authoritarian rule, could a mass protest
reasonably overthrow 

96
00:07:12,090 --> 00:00:00,000
the government?
