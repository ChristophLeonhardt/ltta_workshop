so is it important to the Russians meddled in our elections okay well all of our intelligence agencies both under Obama and under Trump say that they did but what does that mean is it a matter of getting some emails and releasing into the public well if it was just that I would think that it was not that big a deal and there's a lot of different ways that press could have gotten those emails I wish we saw the emails from the Republicans as well but they were newsworthy on the other hand if it's a bigger issue regarding Trump and Russia and they have a deal well that would be a different matter and one that's very important and that Muller should investigate the special counsel there but there is a third element that I think actually is the most important which is what if they actually got into the voter rolls now this is an issue that was brought up before but NBC News has new developments on it today first of all let me remind you what the Obama White House used to think about it jeh Johnson who was the Department of Homeland Security secretary during the Russian intrusions said quote 2016 was a wake-up call and now it's incumbent upon States and the feds to do something about it before our democracy is attacked again and those are very strong words and and I think rightfully so here's another quote from Johnson he said we were able to determine the scanning and probing a voter registration databases was coming from the Russian government now that's massive so I don't care if it's the Saudis who are doing it the Chinese who are doing it or Paraguay or Botswana and foreign government trying to infiltrate our voter registration databases is an epic disaster are you positive that the people who did our voter databases are the top cybersecurity experts in the world remember they're done state by state so the guy in Arizona is going to outwit any hacker whether they're Russian Chinese Indian or anything else you're sure about that I'm definitely not sure about it and here's the government saying yeah they're trying to get into the voting rules look I'm worried that people here are gonna hack into it for partisan reasons I think our security and the voting booth is abysmal and anytime you ask any of the states about it early oh that's our business we won't tell you it's secret you know why cuz they're embarrassed because they don't have the top cyber security experts and my guess is that it is at some point going to be shockingly easy to hack into those so now NBC News reporter back in September 2016 that more than 20 states had been targeted by the Russians and God knows how many other governments are trying this and and now that they know how vulnerable we are how many will try in 2018 but that leads us to the news from today so if you're partisan you can say well those are the Obama guys I don't know if I trust them well now we got the Trump administration weighing it the US official in charge of protecting American elections from hacking says the Russians successfully penetrated the voter registration rolls of several US states prior to the 2016 presidential election that's a trump official saying not only that the Russians try they succeeded in penetrating 21 States voter registration rolls now first of all they can mess around with the voting registration and cause mayhem you go in there go them sorry you're not registered Oh or they take a bunch of people off the rolls or they add people to the rules ID so they can cause complete chaos there on top of that you think they're just gonna stop at the registration you think they're gonna say well we did you know we did the emails and we did the voter registration but actually changing the vote counts why we would never hey everybody at the Kremlin or anywhere any other country that wants to influence us you think they're gonna have X and B like should we fix the American elections so that the people we want are elected and then give us potentially trillions of dollars yeah let's not do it I mean we have to take massive safeguards here this is more important than any of the other issues so Jeanette mantra the head of cyber security for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump said quote we saw a targeting of twenty-one states and an exceptionally small number of them were actually successfully penetrated first of all okay that was it back in 2016 every year they're gonna get better at this if they penetrated a couple that means they could penetrate more and I don't care that they didn't successfully do it in all 21 states they targeted 21 next time they'll target 50 and God knows how many times that they will succeed and our state's just thrown up walls go - I don't know mess around with my things I don't want you to look at it because I don't want to be embarrassed no no we got a we have to have our top top experts safeguarding our vote okay Johnson told NBC news back to Jay Johnson he's now worried as since the 2016 election a lot of states have done little to nothing to actually harden their cybersecurity Genet mantra disagrees a little bit she says I would say they've all taken it seriously they've taken it seriously whatever that means what does it mean can we have a sense of what they have done I don't want you to give us the code that's obviously a very bad idea but I want you to say hey here are the precautions Arizona took a New Jersey took an Alabama took right and here are the people that we're using that we you can rest assured are the top experts and they're all the different things that we've done to make sure that nobody's gonna hack in nothing from the states no word at all just take our word for it we got this you don't have this at all Russian targeting of voter registration databases became known in the months leading up to the election when the FBI warned state governments that hackers had in fact infiltrated the Illinois State Board of Elections and attempted to to do the same in Arizona so we know they already got through an Illinois that's already public now the Trump person says no is more than Illinois they got successfully penetrated voter rolls in several different states and have targeted dozens finally more from NBC Johnson said that any state officials who don't believe the federal government should be providing help are being quote naive and quote irresponsible to the people that they're supposed to serve this should be priority number of any investigation now look special councils looking into Trump and whether the laws were broken that's a in a sense a different matter the more important thing is make sure the vote is safe are you sure you know which way the boat rushes are gonna hack I mean if you're a Republican are you now celebrating and you're not taking any precautions in Alabama you're like whoa hey Rosen's there you go you know throw it in our favor how do you know they're gonna throw it in your favor maybe they liked a progressive idea of keeping out of Syria and not antagonizing Russia with further military buildup on their border maybe they'll vote for Democrats can we fix this thing to make sure Americans are voting and no one else it drives me crazy when you have the most important issues being treated as minor throwaways protect the vote at all costs you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
