so often we all want to be liked and that's a natural thing is to say you know I want other people to like me but sometimes people take that too far and they start to say yes to everything that they're asked of because it feels good on one hand to say yes but on the other hand every time you say yes to something you're really saying no to something else that you could be doing with your time and I'll work with a lot of people who will say well I don't want to be selfish but really when you say yes to everything it's about me I want to feel good or I want people to like me more and that in itself can kind of be selfish sometimes a lot of times saying yes this becomes a habit for people they'll just automatically say yes without even thinking about the question or without really thinking about is this something I want to do and so a good trick sometimes is to be able to say well my standard answer is gonna be thanks for asking I'm gonna think about that and I'll get back to you or something along those lines to give yourself a chance to really step aside and think is this something I really want to do or not and to know that you don't always have to have a reason why you say no it's okay to say no thanks for asking but I can't do that and you don't necessarily meet an excuse when people say yes to everything sometimes it's a matter of trying an experiment so to say I'm gonna say no to somebody and see if they really don't like me anymore if they're completely crushed that I didn't do what they wanted to do and then when you see well you know other people are usually much more accepting of the answer no then you might be giving yourself credit for it gets a little bit easier over time to start saying no to to bigger things that might be asked of you
