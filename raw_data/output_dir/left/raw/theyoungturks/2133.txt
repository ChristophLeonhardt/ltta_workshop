1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,170
NEW DATA PULLED FROM MILLIONS OF
CHILDREN AROUND AMERICA OVER

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:11,290
DECADES REVEALS A BLEAK FUTURE
FOR BLACK BOYS REGARDLESS

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,789
OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS.

4
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,869
THIS STUDY IS OUT OF STANFORD,
HARVARD AND THE CENSUS BUREAU

5
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:19,300
AND THEY FOUND THAT:

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:34,080
WHAT IS 

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:47,010
INTERESTING IS THAT:

8
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:58,540
FOR POOR CHILDREN ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE OF 

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,540
THE

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:06,159
SPECTRUM, THE PATTERN IS
REVERSED.

11
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:23,009
FURTHER, A LOT OF 

12
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,690
ARGUMENT THAT
POST-RACIAL LIBERALS LIKE

13
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,899
TO USE IS THE FACT THAT MAYBE
THERE IS SOME SORT OF CLASS

14
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,590
DIFFERENCE AND CLEARLY BY SOME
OF THE INFORMATION I JUST

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,840
STATED, THAT IS NOT THE CASE
EITHER.

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,229
THEY DID SOMETHING THAT IS
REALLY INTERESTING THAT I

17
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,229
WANT TO GET INTO.

18
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,890
WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT BOYS WHO
GREW UP, BLACK BOYS WHO GREW IN

19
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,829
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH PRESENT
FATHERS ACTUALLY FARED A LOT

20
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,999
BETTER, BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING
THOUGH, IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY

21
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,130
HAVE TO BE THEIR FATHER, IT IS
JUST FATHERS IN THE

22
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,299
NEIGHBORHOOD.

23
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,299
FATHERS AROUND THEM.

24
00:01:52,299 --> 00:02:05,539
THAT IS WHEN IT 
GETS INTO THE

25
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:06,939
NITTY-GRITTY IN THE STUDY AND

26
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,640
THIS INFORMATION, IS TALKING
ABOUT INCARCERATION AND THE FACT

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,890
THAT BLACK BOYS ARE TREATED
DIFFERENTLY, AND THAT EXPLAINS

28
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,170
SOME OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
BLACK MEN AND BLACK WOMEN, IS

29
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,370
THAT BLACK BOYS ARE TREATED AS
MORE DANGEROUS AND THEY ARE AND

30
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,190
DISCIPLINED AT EARLIER AGES AND
THEY REALLY SOMETIMES SHOWED

31
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,190
THAT

32
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,800
SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE
BECAUSE THEY ARE VIEWED IN THE

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,820
STEREOTYPICAL WAY THAT HAS AN
EFFECT BOTH IN TERMS OF

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,020
THEIR INCOME AND IN TERMS OF
INCARCERATION RATE.

35
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:49,080
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS:

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,390
THAT STATISTIC IS REALLY
ASTOUNDING.

37
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,210
YEAH, AND THE LAST ONE THERE
IS ALSO ASTOUNDING.

38
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,690
LET'S DO THAT ONE, AND THEN I
WANT TO GET INTO WHY, AND

39
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:09,780
THAT 
IS THE INTERESTING PART.

40
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,420
LOOK, THERE ARE NUMBER OF
POSSIBILITIES AS TO WHY WE

41
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,910
HAVE DIFFERENT RESULTS HERE AND
THE RESULTS THAT HANNAH

42
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,210
JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU.

43
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,910
THE RIGHT WING WOULD SOMETIMES,
SOME OF THE RIGHT WING WAS

44
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,150
SAY RACE.

45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,600
WE TOLD YOU, IT IS NOT
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS.

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,070
EVEN IF THEY ARE RAISED IN
WEALTHY FAMILIES, A LOT OF

47
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,580
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WOUND UP IN
PRISON.

48
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,380
AND THEN A LOT OF LIBERALS,
INCLUDING MYSELF, THOUGHT THAT

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,260
IT WAS MAINLY SOCIOECONOMIC
SITUATION, BUT THIS STUDY SHOWS

50
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,170
THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS,
IT IS NOT TO SAY IT IS NOT A

51
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,930
FACTOR, YOU ARE STILL IN WAY
BETTER SHAPE IF YOU GROW UP IN A

52
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,670
WEALTHIER HOUSEHOLD, BUT IT IS
NOT THE DETERMINATE FACTOR

53
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,850
APPARENTLY, OR THE MAJORITY
FACTOR DEPENDING ON I WANT TO

54
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,850
PHRASE IT.

55
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,170
TO YOUR POINT, AND THEN
THERE'S CULTURE.

56
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,680
I WANT TO GET INTO CULTURE, I
THINK IT IS THE HARDEST

57
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
THING AND I THINK CULTURE IS
NOT JUST BLACK CULTURE, BUT

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,870
ALSO AMERICAN CULTURE.

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,230
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

60
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,649
IF IT WAS JUST ABOUT RACE, THEN
BLACK WOMEN WOULD BE JUST

61
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,818
AS AFFECTED, BUT THEY ARE NOT.

62
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:22,889
THEY MAKE THE SAME AS WHITE
WOMEN IN THE SAME SOCIOECONOMIC

63
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:23,889
GROUP.

64
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,729
I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYONE EVEN
CLAIMS THAT THERE IS SOME

65
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,580
SORT OF GENDER DISPARITY WITHIN
A RACE, THAT ASIAN WOMEN

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,139
COULD BE BRILLIANT BUT ASIAN MEN
COULD BE BAD.

67
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,599
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT.

68
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:38,030
I DON'T EVEN THINK THE CRAZY
RIGHT WING MAKE THAT CASE

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,499
SO IT IS NOT ABOUT RACE BECAUSE
BLACK WOMEN OVERALL DO OKAY.

70
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,590
IT IS NOT GENETIC, THAT IS WHAT
I MEAN BY THAT.

71
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,449
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF ETHNIC OR
RACIAL TRAITS.

72
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,240
ON THE SOCIOECONOMIC SITUATION,
IT PARTLY IS DEFINITELY

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,819
THAT BECAUSE BLACK WOMEN DO
OKAY.

74
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,720
IF YOU'RE RICHER AND YOU'RE A
BLACK WOMAN YOU STAY RICHER AND

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,419
YOU STAY AS RICH AS WHITE WOMEN
IN THE SAME CATEGORY, BUT

76
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,711
THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING
THAT IF YOU ARE A BLACK

77
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,229
MALE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE
CASE.

78
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:11,020
TO ME, AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK
THE INTERESTING PART OF THE

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,169
CONVERSATION IS, DIVING INTO
CULTURE AND FINDING OUT WHAT WE

80
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,920
THINK IS THE REALITY ON BOTH
SIDES, WHETHER IT IS CULTURE

81
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,800
WHERE THE FATHERS ARE NOT
PRESENT, BUT ALSO THE

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,669
AMERICAN CULTURE OVERALL THAT
STIGMATIZES AND STEREOTYPES

83
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,340
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES MORE THAN
ALMOST ANY OTHER GROUP AND

84
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,469
IN FACT, SEEMS DEFINITIVELY MORE
THAN ANY OTHER GROUP.

85
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,419
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE
TALKED ABOUT IS THE

86
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,560
FACT OF THE WAY CHILDREN ARE
TREATED IN PRESCHOOL

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,390
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THIS IS
ACROSS BOARDS, THEIR

88
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,229
GENDERS BUT IT COULD ALSO BE
DETERMINED THAT WAY TOO.

89
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:49,090
THE WAY TEACHERS AND CARETAKERS
JUST SAW MINORITY CHILDREN AS

90
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,620
MORE DANGEROUS OR AS OLDER THAN
THEY WERE, SO A FIVE-YEAR-OLD

91
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,810
KID, THEY WOULD BE LIKE HE'S
ACTING UP, HE IS LIKE A 10 YEAR

92
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,810
OLD

93
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,639
ACTING UP, SO PUNISH HIM IN
A DIFFERENT WAY AND IT ALSO

94
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,259
LEADS TO THE PRESENCE
OF POLICE OFFICERS IN

95
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,370
SCHOOLS, YOU'VE SEEN POLICE
OFFICERS ASKED TO COME IN

96
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,199
AND ATTACK A CHILD BECAUSE
THEY'RE ACTING ON THE

97
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
TEACHER CANNOT HANDLE IT
ANYMORE.

98
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,180
WHAT'S HAPPENING WHICH WE DID
NOT GET TO SEE IN A LOT OF

99
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,969
CASES AS THEY FEEL LIKE THERE
NEEDS TO BE LAW ENFORCEMENT

100
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:12,969
BROUGHT IN RIGHT AWAY.

101
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:15,800
THAT IS INGRAINED SO OF ALL
THESE FACTORS, I WENT THROUGH

102
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,909
THE SEVERAL PAGE ARTICLE IN THE
NEW YORK TIMES, THE ONE THING

103
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:22,319
THAT IS THE CONSISTANT IS THAT
OUR SOCIETY GETS THINGS WRONG

104
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,319
AND WE

105
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,349
DO NOT LEARN FROM SOME OF OUR
MISTAKES, SO WE CAN BLAME OTHER

106
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,009
FACTORS, WHICH WE ALREADY WENT
THROUGH, I'M NOT GOING TO GO

107
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,460
THROUGH THE DETAILS, BUT

108
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,259
WHAT WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSES IS OUR
PERCEPTION AND HOW THE ENTIRE

109
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,210
SOCIETY SEES CERTAIN FOLKS AND
THAT INCLUDES BLACK PEOPLE

110
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,490
SO WHENEVER PEOPLE SAY, YOU
THINK BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T BE

111
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,509
RACIST?

112
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,030
NOT REALLY, BUT WHAT DOES
HAPPEN IS THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS

113
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,949
THAT THE REST OF SOCIETY MAKES
ABOUT BLACK FOLKS, SO DO

114
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,710
BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN
A SOCIETY.

115
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,039
SO THIS CULTURE OF DIFFERENT
CULTURES IS THE AMERICAN

116
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,599
CULTURE AND THE MAIN ONE THAT WE
DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IS WE

117
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,909
REFUSE TO ADMIT WHEN WE ARE
WRONG, AS A COMPLETE COUNTRY.

118
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:06,800
WE ARE AMERICANS, WE ARE RIGHT,
WE'RE THE BEST EVER AND IF

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,849
YOU TELL SOME THING DIFFERENT,
YOU'RE THE WRONG ONE.

120
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,059
WHICH WHEN WE TRY TO ADDRESS OUR
PROBLEMS WHICH IS INGRAINED

121
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:14,469
IN OUR SOCIETY, WE REJECT IT AND
TRY TO PUT IT UP ON

122
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,370
SOMETHING ELSE SO NEVER CHANGES.

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,180
I THINK YOU BRING UP AN
INTERESTING ISSUE.

124
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,279
ADDRESSING OUR PROBLEMS, AND
THAT IS WHAT OBAMA'S

125
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,499
ANTIDISCRIMINATION GUIDELINE FOR
SCHOOLS ACTUALLY TRIED TO COMBAT

126
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:29,020
AND ADDRESS BECAUSE THEY WERE
RECOGNIZING THAT BLACK CHILDREN

127
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,520
AND BLACK BOYS IN PARTICULAR
WERE BEING DISCIPLINED MORE

128
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,800
SEVERELY AND MORE OFTEN THAN THE
OTHER STUDENTS AND THAT IS

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
AN ISSUE THAT CARRIES ON THROUGH
PRESCHOOL AND BEYOND.

130
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,229
EVEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SCHOOL
SAFETY MEASURES, WHEN THEY

131
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,879
ARE SEARCHING BACKPACKS AND
DOING, HAVING KIDS WANDED

132
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,240
AT SCHOOLS, THAT DOES NOT SHOW
ANY SORT OF BENEFIT TO THE

133
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,930
KIDS, TO THE COMMUNITY, ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

134
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,680
IT IS NOT A MORE DANGEROUS
COMMUNITIES, THE KIDS DON'T SHOW

135
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,139
MORE DANGEROUS THINGS ABOUT WHAT
IT DOES IS IT CREATES A SELF

136
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,330
FULFILLING PROPHECY FOR
THE STUDENTS AND KIDS WHO

137
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,779
ARE TREATED AS PRISONERS AND
CRIMINALS AND THEN THEY END UP

138
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:11,690
AS CRIMINALS AND INCARCERATED.

139
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,690
WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT

140
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,229
INCACERATION AND MORE BLACK MEN
WHO ARE INCARCERATED, I'M

141
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,599
NOT SAYING MORE BLACK MEN ARE
COMMITTING CRIME AND I WANT

142
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,539
TO MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE
THEN THAT GOES MORE INTO

143
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:26,900
THE SOCIETAL EXPECTATIONS AND
THE WAY THAT WE TREAT BLACK

144
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,499
MEN IN THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

145
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:31,750
INCARCERATED FOR A CRIME THAT A
WHITE MAN COMMIT.

146
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,708
I WANT TO GO OVER SOME STATS
THAT WE TOUCHED ON THE SHOW

147
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,708
BEFORE

148
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,609
BECAUSE THEIR RELEVANCE OF THIS
CONVERSATION.

149
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,948
BLACKS AND WHITES DO MARIJUANA
AT ABOUT THE SAME RATE.

150
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:45,640
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE ARRESTED
AT FOUR TIMES THE RATE.

151
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,910
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
ARRESTED THE MOST?

152
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,130
BLACK MEN.

153
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,881
SO THAT AFFECTS THEM A LOT MORE
SO IT'S A LITTLE HARDER FOR

154
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:56,200
THEM TO RECOVER IF YOU HAVE BEEN
PUT IN JAIL.

155
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,910
THERE'S A LAWYER THAT THEY
TALK TO HERE IN ONE OF THE

156
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,130
SUBURBS OF WASHINGTON, AND
MARILYN, THAT'S ACTUALLY

157
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,800
ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE BLACK MEN
DO JUST AS WELL AS WHITE

158
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,430
MEN BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF
FATHERS AROUND AND HE SAID LOOK,

159
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,079
EVEN ME, EVERY TIME I GO TO THE
MALL I HAVE TO THINK THROUGH,

160
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,260
SHOULD I PUT ON SWEATPANTS OR
SHOULD I PUT ON MY SPORTS COAT?

161
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,850
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO
PUT ON A SPORTS COAT IN

162
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,190
THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEKEND TO
GO TO THE MALL, BUT HE IS LIKE

163
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,410
IF I GO IN THE WRONG OUTFIT, GOD
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,

164
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,750
AND THAT IS REAL AND THAT IS
WHAT THE STUDY SHOWS AS WELL.

165
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,269
THAT DISPARITY AND HOW THEY ARE
TREATED IS EVIDENT THROUGHOUT.

166
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,570
THE OTHER PART IS, IT'S STILL A
SOCIOECONOMIC SITUATION,

167
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,360
IT MATTERS A LOT.

168
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,000
THE AVERAGE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
BORN INTO A TWO-PARENT FAMILY

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,620
IS BORN INTO A FAMILY THAT HAS
ABOUT $16,000 IN WEALTH.

170
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,750
THE AVERAGE WHITE AMERICAN BORN
INTO A TWO-PARENT FAMILIES BORN

171
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,600
INTO A FAMILY THAT HAS $161,000
IN WEALTH AND HERE THEY SHOW

172
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,410
AFRICAN-AMERICANS MADE UP 35% OF
ALL CHILDREN RAISED IN THE

173
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,660
BOTTOM 1% OF THE INCOME
DISTRIBUTION, SO THAT IS A HUGE

174
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,410
PERCENTAGE, AND THEY MADE UP
LESS THAN 1% OF THE CHILDREN AT

175
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,880
THE VERY TOP SO THEY START AT A
DISADVANTAGE TO BEGIN WITH AND

176
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,070
THEN YOU ADD IN THE RACE ISSUES,
THE LET'S TALK ABOUT CULTURE

177
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,100
OVERALL, BECAUSE ONE OF THE
OTHER THINGS IT WAS IN THE STUDY

178
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,170
THAT I THINK WAS REALLY
ILLUSTRATIVE WAS WHAT HAPPENS TO

179
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,380
ASIANS BECAUSE ASIAN AMERICANS
ACTUALLY OUTPERFORM WHY

180
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,560
AMERICANS ON INCOME WITH A HUGE
BUTT, AND THE BUT IS WHAT I

181
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,240
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE
IN THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED.

182
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,310
ONLY IF THEY ARE
FIRST-GENERATION IMMIGRANTS

183
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,860
OR IF THEIR PARENTS ARE.

184
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,110
ONCE THEIR PARENTS ARE BORN
HERE, THEN BEING ASIAN

185
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,399
AMERICAN DOES NOT HELP AT ALL.

186
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,589
SO TO ME WHAT THAT SAYS IS,
CULTURE MATTERS.

187
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,399
CULTURE MATTERING IS BOTH
IMPORTANT AND UNCOMFORTABLE

188
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,500
IN A LOT OF WAYS, BUT IMMIGRANTS
COME IN, HARD-WORKING,

189
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,040
YEAH, IT IS A STEREOTYPE BUT
ALSO TRUE, AND THEY WIND UP

190
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,100
OUTPERFORMING EVERYONE ELSE IN
THE COUNTRY BUT THE MINUTE

191
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,699
THEY GET USED TO AMERICAN
CULTURE, THEY ARE DONE FOR.

192
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,819
THE EFFECT OF THE MEAN, TO THE
AVERAGE.

193
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:08,950
DOES IT MATTER THAT, TO HAVE
MORE FATHERS PRESIDENT IN

194
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,220
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES?

195
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,660
APPARENTLY DOES MATTER BECAUSE
IN QUEENS, THE BRONX, AND

196
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,630
MARYLAND WHERE THERE MORE
FATHER'S OVERALL IN THE

197
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,209
COMMUNITY, THEY DO BETTER.

198
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,199
THEY DO JUST AS WELL AS WHITE
DUDE ON THE OTHER HAND,

199
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,350
DOESN'T MATTER THAT AMERICAN
CULTURE HAS THIS DEEPLY

200
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,279
INGRAINED INSTITUTIONAL RACISM
AND TO JAYAR'S POINT, IT IS

201
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,259
ALSO BLACK COPS WHO THINK THE
SAME WAY.

202
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,980
THERE ARE ALSO BLACK LEADERS WHO
THINK THE SAME WAY.

203
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,420
THEY DO NOT MEAN TO AND THAT IS
WHY WE SAY IT IS NOT ALWAYS

204
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,430
DONE OUT OF MALICE IN SOME CASES
IT IS BUT IN A LOT OF CASES

205
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,089
IT IS NOT THAT IS WHY IT IS SO
IMPORTANT TO UPROOT THAT

206
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,819
UGLY THOUGHT IN THE BACK OF HER
HEAD WHICH LEAD TO THESE

207
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,850
UGLY RESULTS.

208
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,389
IT IS A SYMPTOM OF OUR
SOCIETY AS I ALREADY MENTIONED

209
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,100
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE
THING.

210
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,610
SENATOR TIM SCOTT SPOKE
OUT ABOUT WHEN THINGS ARE

211
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,949
HAPPENING WITH POLICE BRUTALITY,
HIM BEING PULLED OVER SEVEN

212
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,930
TIMES IN A YEAR AND THEY DIDN'T
BELIEVE THAT AND HE HAD A

213
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,110
SENATOR PEN, HE CAN'T GET INTO
THE MEETING, I RECOGNIZE THE PEN

214
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,110
BUT

215
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,110
I DO NOT RECOGNIZE YOU.

216
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,209
ON THE
OTHER HAND, BROCK TURNER, A

217
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,860
COLLEGE KID WAS CONVICTED OF
RAPE GOT SIX MONTHS AND GOT OUT

218
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,970
THREE MONTHS INTO THE SENTENCE
AND IS NOW CURRENTLY APPEALING

219
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,970
THE

220
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,069
SENTENCE BECAUSE THIS IS SO
UNFAIR.

221
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:24,700
THERE IS A MINDSET THAT YOU
BEGIN YOUR LIFE WITH AND YOU

222
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,600
APPROACH SOCIETY THAT WAY AND
SOCIETY TREATS YOU ACCORDINGLY.

223
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,519
TO THAT POINT, I WANT TO READ
JUST ONE LINE FROM THIS ARTICLE

224
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,960
THAT IS SO WELL DONE.

225
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,699
IT SAYS
THE WORST PLACES FOR WHITES

226
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:39,769
PRODUCE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ABOUT
AS GOOD AS THE BEST PLACES

227
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:43,220
BLACKS AND I THINK THAT IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY

228
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,800
FROM THE STORY.

229
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,540
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHITE
PRIVILEGE OR ANYBODY DOES, FOR

230
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,100
THE 18TH TIME, OR PROBABLY
ACTUALLY MORE THAN THAT, IT DOES

231
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,450
NOT MEAN IF YOU ARE BORN IN A
HOLLOW IN WEST VIRGINIA YOU'RE

232
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,319
PRIVILEGED AND IN GREAT SHAPE
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT EVEN IF

233
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,319
YOU

234
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,680
ARE BORN INTO THAT SITUATION AND
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE IS BORN

235
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,810
INTO A MUCH HIGHER ECONOMIC
UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS, EVEN THE

236
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,690
RICH, THEY SHOULD HAVE A MUCH
GREATER ADVANTAGE OVER UB BUT

237
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,170
THEY DON'T, THEY GET BROUGHT
DOWN BY THE FACTORS THAT WE

238
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,440
MENTIONED HERE AND IF YOU ARE ON
THE SAME PLANE ECONOMICALLY, THE

239
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,759
BLACK GUYS A LOT MORE SCREWED
THAN YOU ARE AND SO YOU MIGHT

240
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,779
NOT SEE THAT IN YOUR LIFE
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK, IT IS

241
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,450
NOT LIKE I AM LIVING HIGH ON THE
HOG, BUT WHAT THIS STUDY IS

242
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,410
SHOWING YOU IS THAT THEY ARE
EVEN WORSE OFF AND IT IS

243
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,350
NOT TO MALIGN YOU OR CRITICIZE
YOU.

244
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,439
IT IS SO WE CAN GET THOSE
THOUGHTS OUT OF OUR HEADS.

245
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:43,790
BLESSING IS YOU REMEMBER THE
FAMOUS KANSAS STUDY WHERE

246
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,699
THE TEACHERS HAD THE BROWN ITEM
BLUE-EYED KIDS UNTIL THE BRAN

247
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,810
I KIDS THEY WERE SCARY AND THE
BLUE-EYED KIDS WERE INFERIOR.

248
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,220
NOT ONLY DID THE BROWN EYED
KIDS IMMEDIATELY START DOING

249
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,149
BETTER IN SCHOOL, SOME PROXY FOR
WEALTH HERE IN THE STUDY, BUT

250
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:00,649
THE BLUE-EYED KIDS IMMEDIATELY
INTERNALIZED IT AND STARTED

251
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,370
DOING WORSE AND THEN SHE FLIPPED
IT AND THEN AGAIN, NOW THE

252
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,019
BLUE-EYED KIDS THOUGHT THEY WERE
SUPERIOR AND THE BROWN EYED KIDS

253
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,139
THAT THEY WERE INFERIOR AND THE
RESULTS IMMEDIATELY SHOWED IT.

254
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,600
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO FIGHT
AGAINST THE STEREOTYPES SO

255
00:14:14,600 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WE CAN FIX OUR CULTURE.
