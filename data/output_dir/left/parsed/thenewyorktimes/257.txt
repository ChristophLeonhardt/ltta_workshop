“— our future.
I say, get your résumés ready.”
“My name is Samantha Fuentes and
I am a survivor of the Stoneman
Douglas school shooting.
It’s as if we need permission
to ask our friends not to die!
Lawmakers and
politicians will scream,
‘Guns are not the issue,’
but can’t look me in the eye.
I just threw up on international
television, and it feels great!
You don’t see us
when we get offstage.
You don’t see us when
the cameras turn off.
You don’t see when you have
panic attacks or when you cry,
and you cry, and you
can’t stop crying.”
“You all right?”
“Yeah, Sam!”
“Thank you so much.”
“Woo!”
“When I got shot, the bullet
was deferred into a wall first,
before hitting me,
and then broke apart.
So I have pieces of
metal in my face.
And like, I can stick my
finger on the top of my lip
and feel a piece of metal.
And that alone — 
that’s not normal.
Like, there’s nothing
normal about having
metal in your face,
unless it’s braces.
When I got to D.C., I really
didn’t know what to expect.
D.C.’s honestly really pretty.
I wish I could appreciate
it more, but I can’t.
I feel like sometimes
I’m not the right person,
or maybe this isn’t my job.
Or maybe, as an 18-year-old,
like, this isn’t the path
that I was supposed to take.
“This is for MSNBC.”
“We have another 14.”
“I can move, also.”
“We can move somewhere else.”
“I’m just not ready for this.
I’m sorry.”
“It’s O.K.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Yeah, we’re going
somewhere else.”
“O.K., cool.”
“These are some of the
families from Parkland.”
“Hi, I’m Josh.”
“Oh.
No, no, it’s fine.
Ever since the shooting, I
have been suffering from PTSD.
You don’t really think
you notice it at first,
until, like, something
sets you off.
Sometimes when someone
beeps their horn
or they slam their door, or
if someone, like, sneezes
too loudly, it freaks me out.”
“I’m really honored to have
a chance to meet with you.
And you guys have really been
through a lot, haven’t you?”
“Yeah.”
“I’d really love to
just hear what’s
on your mind, how
you guys are doing.”
“I don’t ever want someone
to be in my position.
I don’t ever want someone
to be afraid of loud noises
and afraid to go to school.
And I think, out
of all the people
who can speak efficiently
about the topic are
the people who have been in
front of a barrel of an AR-15.”
“The voice of moral
authority that you all have
is just a really,
really powerful voice.
It’s really powerful.”
“Some people don’t believe
that participating in a cause
will ever make a difference.”
“So I would like to
bring to the stage
a poet from Stoneman
Douglas, Samantha Fuentes.”
“And some people don’t
believe that they matter.
And if you’re just
that one person,
just speak up for yourself.
Just having those ears
available and having those
faces to look at and to
speak to is the first step.
Can my present love
breach the past tense?
Does loving the
dead make any sense?
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Will you come back
to this place?
I feel like I’ve been changed.
Like, maybe not — like,
yes, maybe physically.
But like, I feel like
something more is there, like,
when I look at myself.
Like, there is this
feeling that I really
can’t wrap my head around
that, like, just confuses me.
And like, it always happens when
I look at myself in the mirror.
And like, I have to realize
that I’m not the same person
and I had no control
of that transformation.
Today is March 24, the
March for Our Lives.
Protect our schools like
we do our other government
establishments!
And one more request —
listen.
Will you give up,
or is enough enough?”
