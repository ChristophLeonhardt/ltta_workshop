there are some bad spending habits that the rich people avoid and that unfortunately poor people middle class people have what I found out was that wealth success being in the middle class being poor is all about your habits emotional purchases these are oh I love that beautiful red dress or that cute sports car and you make this emotional purchase and oftentimes it causes you to go into debt if their big purchase but if not then you are depleting your savings account your checking account spontaneous purchases are also poor habit that's something the rich avoid well this is the very reason why at the checkout counters they have all of these goodies for people to buy the retailer's know that the human brain works off of impulse many times and they'll make this spontaneous purchase and they add up and they could really cause a lot of damage you want to spend modestly one of the smartest things you can do is to purchase a modest house in a modest neighborhood this means you're not only going to have a lower mortgage you're going to have lower real estate taxes you're going to have lower utility costs lower home repairs one good decision like that and it has a ripple effect throughout your spending so those are a couple of the bad habits to avoid
