00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:26,977
CRIMINAL BREACH OF TRUST.

MAYOR GIULIANI THINKS THAT'S A

17
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,547
FACT.

AS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND

HIS LEGAL TEAM, THEY DO HAVE THE

44
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,831
POWER TO LITERALLY ORDER THE

AUTHORITY.

52
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,677
EVEN THE DOJ ADMITS THEY CANNOT

00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,045
CHARGE A SITTING PRESIDENT WITH

54
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:35,546
OBSTRUCTION.

55
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,682
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IT?

56
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,651
ALSO, THE PRESIDENT'S POWER TO

00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:45,756
POWER.

59
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:48,025
OVER THE WEEKEND, THAT IS

60
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:48,926
CLINTON SYCOPHANT TURNED

STEPHANOPOULOS, YOU CAN SEE THEM

WHISPERING IN CLINTON ABBAS RISK

64
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:00,104
HE ASKED RUDY GIULIANI,

65
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:00,838
DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY, FORMER

66
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,506
NEW YORK CITY MAYOR, WHAT IS A

67
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:05,009
COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL TOTALLY

68
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,645
HYPOTHETICAL AND, FRANKLY,

69
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,481
RIDICULOUS QUESTION ABOUT THIS

70
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,281
VERY CONCEPT.

71
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,683
IT IS IRRELEVANT TO EVERYTHING

72
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:13,550
IN THE REALITY THAT IS

73
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,917
HAPPENING.

74
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:15,753
TAKE A LOOK.

75
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:18,255
>> DO YOU AND THE PRESIDENT'S

76
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:19,723
ATTORNEYS BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT

77
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,725
HAS THE POWER TO PARDON HIMSELF?

78
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,861
>> HE'S NOT, BUT HE PROBABLY

79
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:24,328
DOES.

80
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:26,096
HE HAS NO INTENTION PARDONING

81
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:26,430
HIMSELF.

82
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,932
NOT TO SAY HE CAN'T.

83
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,335
I MEAN, THAT'S A REALLY

84
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,069
INTERESTING CONSTITUTIONAL --

85
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,371
CAN THE PRESIDENT PARDON HIMSELF

86
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,072
CAN THE PRESIDENT PARDON HIMSEL

87
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:35,739
HIMSELF?

88
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,408
IT WOULD BE AN OPEN QUESTION.

89
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,143
I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY GET

90
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:40,344
ANSWERED BY, GOSH, THAT'S WHAT

91
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:41,478
THE CAUSE EDITION SETS, AND IF

92
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:44,248
YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT, CHANGE IT

93
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:44,581
YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT, CHANGE I

94
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,149
IT.

95
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:45,716
I THINK THE POLITICAL

96
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:47,918
RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT WOULD BE

97
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,352
TOUGH.

98
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:49,820
PARDONING OTHER PEOPLE IS ONE

99
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,120
THING.

100
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,923
PARDONING YOURSELF IS ANOTHER.

101
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:53,924
>> Sean: RUDY GIULIANI WAS

102
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,125
KIND OF LAUGHING ABOUT IT.

103
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,894
HE HAS THE POWER, BUT THAT'S NOT

104
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,530
GOING TO HAPPEN.

105
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,165
LOCALITY MEDIA IS REACTING.

106
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:01,865
LITTLE GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS

107
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:02,433
ASKED ALL BEWILDERED.

108
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,101
NOT A NEW CONCEPT OR LET'S GO

109
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:08,906
BACK DOWN MEMORY LANE, THEN

110
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,008
CANDIDATE 2016 HOT WATER OVER A

111
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,076
GROSS, BLATANT'S USE OF

BATHROOM CLOSET SERVER?

114
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,581
MANY WERE ACTUALLY ARGUING,

115
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:20,317
THINKING SHE WAS GOING TO BE

116
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,152
ELECTED PRESIDENT IF SHE COULD

117
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:22,753
RIGHTLY PARDON HERSELF.

118
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:25,723
LET'S LOOK AT THIS HEADLINE FROM

119
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:26,356
DAN ABRAMS LAW AND CRIME

120
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:27,257
WEBSITE.

121
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:30,427
IF HILLARY CLINTON IS INDICTED,

122
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,161
PRESIDENT CLINTON COULD PARDON

123
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:32,429
HERSELF AND CONGRESS MIGHT BE

124
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:32,796
HELPLESS.

125
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,898
THIS ARTICLE FROM

DOES."

131
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,576
BY NO MEANS IT'S AN HONEST

132
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,643
OPINION UPON LEGAL EXPERTS.

133
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,412
THAT RIDICULOUS QUESTION TO

134
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,280
GIULIANI CAME FROM THE SAME GUY

135
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,784
WHO MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF AS

136
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,652
BEING BILL CLINTON'S POLITICAL

137
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,621
HIT MAN DURING HIS RUN FOR THE

138

PRESIDENT.

139
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,890
THIS IS NOW THE SPOKESMAN AND

140
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,525
NEWS PERSON FOR "ABC NEWS."

141
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,893
HE IS NO PETER JENNINGS.

142
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:06,130
TAKE A LOOK.

143
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,365
>> I CONSIDER WITH FACTS OF

144
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:10,400
NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS OF YOU

145
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,535
WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH.

146
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:19,942
IT'S COMPLETELY [BLEEP].

147
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:21,345
YOU WOULD BE LAUGHED AT.

148
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,546
YOU WOULD THINK YOU ARE CRAZY.

149
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:25,516
I GUARANTEE YOU IF YOU DO THIS,

150
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,116
YOU WILL NEVER WORK IN

151
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,418
DEMOCRATIC POLITICS AGAIN.

152
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:29,052
MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO.

153
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:29,887
I'M NOT SAYING IT MATTERS.

154
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,923
YOU WILL BE EMBARRASSED BEFORE

155
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:33,557
THE NATIONAL PRESS CORPS.

156
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,626
PEOPLE WILL THINK, NOBODY WILL

157
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:37,294
BELIEVE YOU.

158
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,930

161
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:42,366
AND UNBIASED.

162
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,134
HE SEEMS LIKE A REAL JOURNALIST

163
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,502
IN THAT VIDEO.

164
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,170
MEANWHILE, RUDY GIULIANI'S

165
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,939
COMMENTS WERE CLEARLY BASED ON

166
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:49,907
LEGAL PRECEDENT.

167
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,775
EARLIER TODAY, THE PRESIDENT

168
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:56,280
HIMSELF TWEETED OUT, "AS HAS

169
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,514
BEEN STATED BY NUMEROUS LEGAL

00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,849
SCHOLARS, I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE

171
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,017
RIGHT TO PARDON MYSELF, BUT WHY

172
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:02,586
WOULD I DO THAT WHEN I'VE DONE

173
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:03,053
NOTHING WRONG?"

174
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,922
WHICH BRINGS US TO A VERY

175
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:05,489
IMPORTANT POINT.

176
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,090
THIS PHONY, FAINT, SO COUNT

177
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,793
OUTRAGE FROM THE LEFT AND THE

00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:10,427
MEDIA AND OTHER ANTITRUST

179
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,496
GROUPIES IS OVER SOMETHING

180
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:13,897
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND

181
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,631
SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN

182
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,501
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE

183
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:21,572
NOTHING WRONG AND IT WAS A

184
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,907
WAS ACTUALLY LAUGHING AT.

185
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,641
STILL, THE MEDIA'S ECHO CHAMBER

186
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:28,545
BLOWING UP OVER SOMETHING

187
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:29,713
ROOTED, ILLEGAL PRESIDENTS,

188
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,715
BACKED UP BY REAL CONSTITUTIONAL

189
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,684
SCHOLARS, YET SOMETHING THAT HAS

PROBABLY WON'T.

201
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,186
TAKE A LOOK AT THE MEDIA ONCE

202
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:40,691
AGAIN MAKING MUCH TO DO ABOUT

203
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,992
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, KNOWING THIS

204
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:44,194
IS THE SAME MEDIA, AS YOU WATCH

205
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:45,229
THIS, TOTALLY MISSING IN ACTION

206
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,298
ON THE BIGGEST STORY IN THEIR

00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:50,701
LIFETIMES, WHICH IS THE LARGEST,

208
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:51,368
BIGGEST ABUSE OF POWER

209
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,035
CORRUPTION SCANDAL IN U.S.

210
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:52,369
HISTORY.

211
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,303
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

212
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:57,307
THIS IS WHAT THEY FOCUS ON.

213
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:59,543
>> A STUNNING STATEMENT FROM THE

214
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:00,510
PRESIDENT OPENLY DECLARING THAT

215
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,812
HE BELIEVES HE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

216
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,982
>> TRIED TO PICTURE AN ORDINARY

217
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:07,084
CRIMINAL WHO COMMITTED A CRIME

218
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,185
SAYING THAT I COULD DO WHATEVER

219
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,286
I WANT, BY THE WAY, I WILL

220
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,621
PARDON MYSELF.

221
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,322
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ARE GUILTY

222
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,323
WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

223
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:13,991
>> THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE

224
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,326
TALKING ABOUT THE.

225
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:17,761
THE PRESIDENT ALL MORNING SAYING

UNITED STATES IS ABOVE THE LAW

228
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,631
AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY

229
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,331
WITH THE CONSTITUTION OR THE

230
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,733
LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.

231
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,902
THAT IS STAGGERING.

232
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:26,670
>> THEY ARE KIDDING THEMSELVES

233
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,338
AND WILL BE A LETDOWN IF THEY

234
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:32,309
EVER DECIDE TO TRY THIS ON, TO

235
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,278
TAKE THIS AND PUT WHEELS ON

236
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:35,979
THIS, TAKE IT OUT FOR A SPIN TO

237
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,780
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT?

238
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,814
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, GO TO

239
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,317
THE SUPREME COURT.

00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,085
YOU MAY GET ONE, YOU MAY GET TWO

241
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:42,386
VOTES.

242
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,721
THAT'S IT.

243
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,857
YOU WILL BE RUN OVER.

244
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:47,991
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE

245
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:48,959
UNITED STATES IS TALKING ABOUT

246
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,626
PARDONING HIMSELF ABOUT NOT

247
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,328
BEING INDICTED.

248
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,095
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE

249
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:55,165
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT -- WHAT

250
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,266
INCREDIBLE

251
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,968
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE

252
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,102
TALKING ABOUT THE END OF HIS

253
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,470
PRESIDENCY.

254
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,371
IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

255
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,005
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES

256
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,707
SAYING I'M GOING TO PARDON

257
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:04,408
MYSELF EVEN AS REPUBLICANS TRY

258
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:05,976
TO PROTECT THEM, YOU ARE TALKING

259
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,778
ABOUT THE COLLAPSE IN MANY WAYS

260
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,813
OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THIS

261
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:10,180
REPUBLIC.

262
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,315
>> Sean: ANOTHER WEEK, MORE

263
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:15,686
HYSTERIA, MORE FAINTING MORAL

264
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,520
OUTRAGE, PUSHING THE SAME

265
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,788
SCANDAL FOR PEOPLE WRONG A YEAR

266
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:18,956
AND A HALF, THEY WANT YOU TO

267
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:19,890
TRUST THEM.

268
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,891
NO WONDER THEIR APPROVAL RATINGS

269
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:21,892
ARE IN THE GUTTER.

270
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,527
ALMOST IN SINGLE DIGITS.

271
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,227
JOURNALISM IN THIS COUNTRY IS

272
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,729
DEAD AND BURIED.

273
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,731
ALSO TONIGHT, WE HAVE MORE

274
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:28,966
EVIDENCE YOUR DEEP STATE IS

275
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:31,535
CRUMBLING RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES.

276
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,337
LOOK AT    AT THIS CBS NEWS POL.

277
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:34,104
AMERICANS, THEY LOST CONFIDENCE

278
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,974
IN ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE FOR

279
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:37,708
SO-CALLED PROBE.

280
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,209
THEY AGREE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP,

281
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,913
THE WITCH HUNT NEEDS TO END.

282
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:43,647
"OBAMA'S BUYING SCANDAL LOOKING

283
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:46,516
A LOT LIKE WATERGATE."

284
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:47,150
I KEEP TELLING YOU IT'S

285
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,721
WATERGATE ON STEROIDS.

MICHAEL McKAY Z, SMART BAND,

00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:55,525
CENTER OF ALL OF THIS.

290
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:58,729
LOOK AT WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT

291
00:07:58,729 --> 00:07:59,730
BRENNAN.

292
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,130
TAKE A LOOK.

293
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,098
>> JOHN BRENNAN IS GOING TO HAVE

294
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:02,332
A LOT TO ANSWER FOR WHEN THIS IS

295
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:03,834
OVER.

296
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:10,073

MUELLER INVESTIGATION, IS A

315
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,717
STORY THAT HAS NOT BEEN YET TOL.

316

THEY GUY WAS THE INFORMANT, YOU

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,321
KNOW, A CIA ASSET.

318
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:24,821
NOT AN FBI ASSET.

319
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:30,127
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW, UM, A

320
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,695
CIA ASSET BECOMES AN FBI

321
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:32,395

RELATING TO UM...

THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

326
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,308
I DO NOT KNOW IF HE HAS ANY

327
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:46,610
CREDENTIALS, IF HE IS A MIND

328
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,513
READER, OR A PSYCHOANALYST.

329
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:51,081
TO BE ANALYZING THE PRESIDENT'S

330
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:51,581
MOTIVES.

331
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:55,419

ABOUT.

335
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,026
>> Sean: THIS IS A SAD MOMENT

336
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:03,560
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

337
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,328
THE HOUSE IN TOTAL

338
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,599
-- DEVIN NUNES GAVE AN UPDATE

339
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,234
ON THE DOJ STONEWALLING.

340
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:14,137
STRONG WORDS FOR HIS COLLEAGUE

341
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,305
INCLUDING HOUSE OVERSIGHT

342
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,673
CHAIRMAN TREY GOWDY WHO WAS DEAD

343
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:18,108
WRONG LAST WEEK AND DIDN'T HAVE

344
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:18,842
ALL THE INFORMATION HE NEEDED

345
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:20,410
BEFORE HE MADE THESE COMMENTS.

346
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,778
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID TO

347
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,148
OUR FRIEND MARIA BERTRAM.

348
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,885
>>   WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDE

349
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:29,119
>>   WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDD

350
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,821
THIS INFORMATION OVER AND OVER

351
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,121
AGAIN.

352
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,323
WE'VE BEEN WAITING.

353
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,491
WE'VE ATTENDED TWO BRIEFINGS.

354
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,259
THEY WERE VERY SMALL BRIEFINGS.

355
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:36,927
NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION.

356
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:39,496
BUT WE WERE HAPPY IT IS

357
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,297
PROGRESS.

358
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:41,198
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME

359
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:41,898
DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION THAT

360
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:45,102
WE WILL REVIEW THIS WEEK.

361
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:46,570
WHAT I SAY IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE

362
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,106
ANYTHING TO HIDE, THE DEPUTY

363
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,273
ATTORNEY GENERAL KNOWS THAT

364
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:50,874
MR. GAUDI WOULD LOVE TO

365
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:53,343
EXONERATE THE DEPARTMENT OF

366
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,679
JUSTICE AND THE FBI.

367
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,714
THE MEDIA HAS TRIED TO MAKE A

368
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:59,483
BIGGER DEAL THAN IT IS.

369
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:01,318
WHAT TREY GOWDY IS SPECIFICALLY

370
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:02,385
TALKING ABOUT IS THE SMALL SLICE

371
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:04,121
OF THE INVESTIGATION WE ARE

372
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:04,788
LOOKING AT AS IT RELATES TO

373
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:08,458
WHETHER OR NOT INFORMANTS, AN

374
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,426
INFORMANT OR INFORMANTS WERE

375
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:09,726
USED.

376
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,895
THAT'S WHAT HE IS REFERRING TO.

377
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:12,696
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

378
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,097
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT A TARGET OF

379
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:14,731
THIS INVESTIGATION.

380
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:18,768
I BELIEVE THAT MR. GOWDY KNOWS

381
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:19,769
AND HE'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN

382
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:20,670
HELPING US GETTING TO THE BOTTOM

383
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,676
OF THE FISA ABUSE THAT OCCURRED.

384
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,512
TO BE WHAT WE PEEL BACK THE

385
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,946
ONIONS OF THE DEEP STATE AND

386
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:30,981
DISMANTLE IT AND WE ARE DOING IT

387
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:34,117
NIGHT BY NIGHT, BRICK BY BRICK.

388
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:35,585
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE FORMER

389
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:36,953
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON BACK IN

390
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:42,259
THE NEWS LIKE AN UNWANTED

391
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,894
HOUSEGUEST, BILL CLINTON BACK IN

392
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,295
THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT MAKING

393
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,296
MONEY, PUSHING A BRAND-NEW BOOK

394
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:49,866
THAT IS OFF TO A HORRIBLE START.

395
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,835
WHAT THE -- WE CAN CALL HIM THE

396
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:57,073
GRANDFATHER OF TODAY'S #MeToo

397
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:57,507
MOVEMENT.

398
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,076
HE FAILS TO REALIZE IT'S NO

399
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:00,477
LONGER 1996.

400
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:01,211
HIS BUDDIES IN THE MAINSTREAM

401
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:02,145
MEDIA CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO

402
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:05,215
GIVE THEM A FREE PASS ON HIS

403
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:08,084
HISTORY OF RAMPANT, HORRIFIC

404
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:08,818
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, AN INTERVIEW

405
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,454
WITH NBC NEWS, THE FORMER

406
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:12,289
PRESIDENT WAS PRESSED -- THEY

407
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,557
COULD HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE THE

408
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,592
ELECTION, BUT, OF COURSE, THEY

409
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,294
WANTED HILLARY TO WIN, BUT HE

410
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:18,695
WAS PRESSED ON HOW HE MISHANDLED

411
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:19,729
THE MONICA LEWIN SKI SCANDAL,

412
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:20,797
AND ALMOST ON BELIEVABLY

413
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:24,301
CLINTON, WHO WAS IMPEACHED

414
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,335
UNDER LIKE UNDER OATH, SAID HE

415
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,903
DID THE RIGHT THING.

416
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:27,904
PAULA JONES SAID HE DROPPED HIS

417
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,307
PANTS AND GOT NAKED IN FRONT OF

418
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,241
HER BUT WE KNOW THAT JUANITA

419
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:34,010
BROADDRICK CHARGED HIM WITH RAPE

420
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,477
BROADDRICK CHARGED HIM WITH RAP

421
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:36,179
RAPE, CATHERINE REALLY TOUCHED

422
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,382
AGAINST HER WILL IN THE

423
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,183
OVAL OFFICE.

424
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:43,320
>> CLINTON SAYS CRITICS ARE NOW

425
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,959
POUNCING IN LIGHT OF THE #MeToo

426
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,061
#MeToo MOVEMENT.

427
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,929
>> A LOT OF THE FACTS HAVE BEEN

428
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,665
CONVENIENTLY OMITTED TO MAKE THE

429
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:56,066
STORY WORK.

430
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,734
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE

431
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:58,468
FRUSTRATED THAT THEY GOT ALL

432
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,736
THESE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS

433
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:03,506
AGAINST THE CURRENT OCCUPANT IN

434
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:04,975
THE OVAL OFFICE AND VOTERS DON'T

435
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,508
SEEM TO CARE.

436
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:08,712
I THINK I DID THE RIGHT THING.

437
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:09,379
I DEFENDED THE CONSTITUTION.

438
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:10,380
TO BE WHAT WHAT FACT?

439
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,382
TELL US.

440
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,517
YOU LOST YOUR LAW LICENSE, YOU

441
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,752
LOST A JUDGMENT IN THE CASE OF

442
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,888
PAUL JONES AND PAID MONEY.

443
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:19,489
AND YOU ARE IMPEACHED.

444
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:25,895
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE

445
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:26,396
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.

446
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,099
IN CASE, IT WAS NBC, CRAIG

447
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,600
MELVIN, CONTINUING TO PRESS

448
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,501
CLINTON AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT

449
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,003
COULD JUST NOT TAKE IT, HANDLE

450
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,505
IT, OR EVEN BELIEVE IT.

451
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,439
LIVING BACK IN 1996.

452
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,942
TAKE A LOOK.

453
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,243
>> DO YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY OR

454
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:43,146
FEEL MORE RESPONSIBILITY?

455
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:43,880
>> NO.

456
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,449
I FELT TERRIBLE THEN.

457
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:50,520
AND I CAME TO GRIPS WITH THAT.

458
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,756
NOBODY BELIEVES THAT I GOT OUT

459
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,392
OF THAT FOR FREE.

460
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:56,926
I LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE

461
00:12:56,926 --> 00:13:00,563
$16 MILLION IN DEBT.

462
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:06,569
BUT YOU TYPICALLY HAVE IGNORED

463
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,205
GAPING FACTS, AND I BET YOU

464
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,342
DON'T EVEN KNOW --

465
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,243
B1 HAVE

466
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:20,083
I'VE NEVER TALKED TO HER.

467
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,651
BUT I DID SAY PUBLICLY ON MORE

468
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,419
THAN ONE OCCASION THAT I WAS

469
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:22,719
SORRY.

470
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,455
I DEALT WITH IT 20 YEARS AGO

471
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:25,755
PLUS.

472
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:27,891
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN TERMS

473
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,225
OF THAT HAVE STAYED WITH ME.

474
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,462
AND I'VE TRIED TO DO A GOOD JOB

475
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:35,799
INSTEAD WITH MY LIFE AND WITH MY

476
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,499
WORK.

477
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,301
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU.

478
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,336
>> Sean: REMEMBER WHEN HE ONCE

479
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:42,539
SAID, WE WERE ALONE, ME AND

480
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:45,342
MONICA, LOOKED OUT IN THE WINDOW

481
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,477
THERE WAS A GIRL IN THE BICYCLE.

482
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:50,013
YOU NEVER REALLY ARE ALONE, ARE

483
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:50,380
YOU?

484
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,150
I HAD NOT HAD SEX WITH THAT

485
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,452
WOMAN A SINGLE TIME.

486
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,120
THEY ACTED ABOVE THE LAW, THE

487
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,355
COMPLICIT MEDIA GAVE THEM A

488
00:13:58,355 --> 00:13:58,655
PASS.

489
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,756
THEY IGNORED ALL OF THIS IN THE

490
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,759
26 ELECTION.

491
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,627
BILL CLINTON'S SICK, PERVERTED

492
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,663
HISTORY OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

493
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:08,098
ALONG WITH ALL OF THESE

494
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:08,798
ALLEGATIONS, WE'VE INTERVIEWED

495
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:12,202
THESE WOMEN, EVEN RAPE WENT

496
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:12,602
UNPUNISHED.

497
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,537
THE MEDIA DIDN'T BRING IT UP IN

498
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:15,705
2016 BECAUSE THEY WANTED HER

499
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:16,039
ELECTED.

500
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,042
WE KNOW THAT HILLARY WAS A  ,

501
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,044
GRANTED LENIENCY BY JAMES COMEY

502
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,046
AFTER SHE COMMITTED FELONIES,

503
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:24,981
VIOLATING THE ESPIONAGE ACT,

504
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,850
DELETED EMAILS, ACID WASHED HER

505
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,186
HARD DRIVE, BROKE UP HER DEVICES

506
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,189
WITH A HAMMER, OR HAD A AIDE DO

507
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,456
IT.

508
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,894
YOU THINK ANY EVERY DAY

509
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:38,661
AMERICANS DID WHAT

510
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:39,229
HILLARY CLINTON DID OR

511
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,597
BILL CLINTON DID?

512
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:44,200
WHAT ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON

513
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,135

PRESIDENT TRUMP QUESTION LIKE

518
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:53,810
ANYONE IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

519
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,178
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THAT

520
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:56,646
RUSSIAN COLLUSION QUESTION MIKE

521
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,514
NO, THE MUELLER WITCH HUNT IS

522
00:14:57,514 --> 00:15:00,016
ONLY INVESTIGATING TRUMP

523
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:00,417
ASSOCIATES.

524
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,086
THIS IS THE DANGER IN THIS

525
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:04,687
COUNTRY TODAY IF WE ARE GOING TO

526
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:05,288
REMAIN A CONSTITUTIONAL

527
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:07,257
REPUBLIC, ONE THAT BENEFITS THE

528
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:08,425
CLINTONS AT EVERY TURN, THEY

529
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:09,692
HAVE LEFT ALL THE WAY TO THE

530
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:10,260
BACK.

531
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,795
BY THE WAY, YOU SHOULD ALL BE

532
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:12,162

DONALD TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED AND

538
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,938
AFTER MONTHS OF PREDICTIONS THAT

539
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:24,474
A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WOULD LEAD

540
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,742
THIS COUNTRY IN RUINS, IT'S NOW

00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:27,210

DISABLED.

559
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,573

THEY CAN USE THE END AND EVEN
