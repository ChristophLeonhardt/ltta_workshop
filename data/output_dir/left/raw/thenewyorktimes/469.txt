1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,902
“You know, you had a —

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,372
you know, someone as despicable
as Hitler

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,807
who didn’t even sink to the —

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,242
to using chemical weapons.”

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,711
“Quote ‘Hitler didn’t even sink
to the level

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,014
of using chemical weapons.’

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:14,981
What did you mean by that?”

8
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,784
“I think when you come to sarin
gas,

9
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,520
there was no — he was not using
the gas

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,589
on his own people the same way

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,157
that Assad is doing.

12
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,026
I mean there was clearly —

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,594
I understand your point,
thank you.

14
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,595
Thank you, I appreciate that.

15
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,830
There was not — in the —

16
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,800
be brought them into the,

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,568
to the Holocaust centers,
I understand that.

18
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,937
But I’m saying in the way that
Assad used them

19
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,006
where he went into towns,
dropped them down,

20
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,541
to innocent — into the middle
of towns.

21
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,510
It was brought — so the use
of it —

22
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,844
and I appreciate the
clarification there,

23
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,112
that was not the intent.”

24
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,981
“That obviously was not my
intention.

25
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,516
And, so, I would ask, obviously,

26
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,585
for folks’ forgiveness, to
understand that I

27
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,587
should not have tried to make
a comparison.”

28
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,457
“This was my mistake, in how
I was describing it.

29
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,926
And for that it’s regrettable
because it’s just a distraction

30
00:00:59,926 --> 00:00:00,000
from the president’s actions.”
