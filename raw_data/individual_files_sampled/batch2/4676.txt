defiance today from New York Republican congressman Chris Collins vowing to continue his re-election campaign and fight federal charges of insider trading the charges that have been levied against me are meritless and I will mount a vigorous defense in court to clear my name I look forward to being fully vindicated and exonerated ending any and all questions relating to my affiliation with an 8th federal prosecutors alleged that Collins used insider information he got as a board member for innate and Australian biotech firm to help his family make illegal trades and avoid losing more than 700,000 dollars the Republican has been one of the president's most vocal supporters he was actually the first member of Congress to endorse him back in 2016 Daily Beast reporter Justin glow has been following this story and joins me now so lay out the prosecution case for us it's pretty simple they they have emails from an aide CEO to Colin saying essentially that their their loan product you know what what they had expected to make millions in tens of millions of dollars on had failed and then you know the prosecution after that then has phone calls that Collins may do his son White House and there's a video and the timing there it is pretty much exactly when they say that those phone calls were happening right yeah and I mean it's just pretty stunning that you know this guy I mean this is a pretty clear-cut insider trading case he had in he had material nonpublic information he gave it to his son who then used that information to make a trade that he otherwise wouldn't have probably wouldn't have made so you know so when he says that the charges are meritless that's just not like my reading of the indictment and I think that the government would say the same thing you know I think for a lot of people at least just anecdotally they're like how is it possible that members of Congress could serve on a board anyway does this raise larger questions about exactly some of the outside stuff do yes so I mean is it's interesting in the press conference he says you know he sort of touts himself the same you know well I didn't take any compensation to serve on this board well what he doesn't mention is that the stock Act requires members of Congress that if they do serve on corporate boards that they're not compensated for that so he's essentially saying that you know he should get credit for following you know following the ethics rules and then the stock Act to you know it kind of does the same thing when he says well you know I didn't trade on the inside information that I had but then he doesn't also add that he was legally prevented by Australian law from trading because there was a trading halt because of the announcement about the drug trial that was coming out I mean what's the sense of his defense because I mean look he's gonna continue to run he's not stepping away obviously he thinks he can get reelected he is in a district where he's been leading the Democrat by a significant margin is this just a situation where he figures he can't be touched at least in the political realm I mean I assume so the guy was under investigation by you know the Office of Congressional Ethics when he makes the phone call from the White House you know giving his son the insider information so yeah I mean he just seems to think he's untouchable but the problem for voters in western New York is that if they really can and if he is convicted of these charges he's not gonna be able to perform his duties as a member of Congress so they're gonna be completely unrepresented if that happens and if he's really going to fight it and not eventually plead out I mean I think it I think the odds of the government winning this case are pretty substantial hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
