NOW REPORTING, JOGEORGE  
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>>> GOOD DAY.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
THE SENATE HAS JUST TAKEN A VOTE
THAT WILL CLEAR THE WAY TO 
REOPENING THE GOVERNMENT THE 
THIRD DAY INTO A GOVERNMENT 
SHUTDOWN.
THAT'S A LIVE LOOK ON THE SENATE
FLOOR AFTER THE VOTE HAS BEEN 
TAKEN ON A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE
WHERE THE SENATORS HAVE AGREED 
TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO 
REOPEN UNTIL FEBRUARY 8th, THREE
MORE WEEKS, IN RETURN FOR A 
COMMITMENT TO GET A VOTE ON THAT
BILL TO PROTECT THE DREAMERS.
800,000 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE 
BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY AS 
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
THAT DEMAND BY DEMOCRATS, THAT 
THERE BE SOME KIND OF A VOTE ON 
DACA, TIED TO THE GOVERNMENT 
FUNDING, HAS BEEN WHAT HELD UP 
THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING OVER 
THESE LAST THREE DAYS BUT NOW A 
BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN 
REACHED TO SECURE A VOTE 
SOMETIME IN FEBRUARY.
I WANT TO GO TO OUR SENIOR 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT MARY
BRUCE FOR MORE ON THIS.
MARY, WHAT YOU SAW HERE IS 
REALLY THE OLD-FASHIONED SENATE.
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN THE
MIDDLE COMING TOGETHER TO FORCE 
THE HANDS OF THEIR LEADERS.
>> Reporter: YEAH, GEORGE, IT 
DOES APPEAR THAT COMPROMISE IS 
ALIVE AND WELL HERE IN 
WASHINGTON AFTER ALL.
THERE HAS BEEN A FRANTIC SERIES 
OF NEGOTIATIONS HERE OVER THE 
WEEKEND UP TO THIS MORNING.
THIS WENT REALLY DOWN TO THE 
WIRE HERE.
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, THEY WERE 
ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AROUND 
THIS DEAL, THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR 
AGREEING TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT 
TEMPORARILY FOR THESE NEXT THREE
WEEKS LEADER McCONNELL, THE 
REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE SENATE,
MADE A COMMITMENT THAT HE WOULD 
TAKE UP AND ACT ON IMMIGRATION 
LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THESE 
DREAMERS.
AND I'M TOLD WHAT REALLY PUSHED 
IT OVER THE LINE FOR DEMOCRATS 
IS THAT HE AGREED THAT IF THEY 
CAN'T REACH AN AGREEMENT BY 
FEBRUARY 8th HE THEN MADE A 
COMMITMENT THAT HE WOULD 
IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP SOME KIND OF
LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS DACA AND 
THE DREAMERS.
BUT GEORGE, THIS ALL COMES DOWN 
TO A COMMITMENT BY MITCH 
McCONNELL.
SO DEMOCRATS HERE ARE 
ESSENTIALLY TAKING HIM AT HIS 
WORD, WHICH COULD BE A BIT OF A 
RISK.
BUT DEMOCRATS THAT WE HAVE 
TALKED TO IN THE LAST HOUR AS 
THIS HAS BEEN COMING TOGETHER 
ESSENTIALLY TOLD US THEY THOUGHT
THIS WAS GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS 
IT WAS GOING TO GET.
IN FACT, ONE SENATOR USING THE 
WORDS OF THE ROLLING STONES TO 
EXPLAIN YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET 
WHAT YOU WANT BUT IF YOU TRY 
SOMETIMES YOU JUST MIGHT FIND, 
GEORGE, YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED.
>> AND ONE THING THEY DIDN'T 
GET, GEORGE, IS ANY COMMITMENT 
TO SEE THE SAME KIND OF 
CONSIDERATION IN THE HOUSE.
>> YEAH, THAT'S STILL THE BIG 
QUESTION HERE.
WHAT COMES NEXT IN THE HOUSE?
NOW, PAUL RYAN HAS SAID THAT HE 
WOULD TAKE UP A VOTE ON THIS 
TEMPORARY FUNDING DEAL.
BUT WILL THEY MAKE THE SAME 
COMMITMENT TO ACT ON DREAMERS 
GOING FORWARD?
THAT REMAINS A BIG QUESTION.
AND OF COURSE WHAT WILL THE 
PRESIDENT DO NEXT AS WELL.
>> I WANT TO GO TO SENIOR WHITE 
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA
FOR MORE ON THAT.
THE PRESIDENT TAKING SOME HEAT 
FROM SENATOR SCHUMER AS HE 
ANNOUNCED THIS AGREEMENT SAYING 
THE PRESIDENT WAS LARGELY ABSENT
FROM THESE NEGOTIATIONS, THE 
DEMOCRATS NEVER KNEW WHERE HE 
STOOD ON THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER 
THE IMMIGRATION BILL, AND THIS 
WAS WORKED OUT IN THE SENATE IN 
THESE FINAL HOURS.
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE CAN CLAIM 
CREDIT FOR NOT BACKING DOWN TO 
THAT DEMOCRATIC DEMAND THAT ANY 
CONSIDERATION OF DACA, THAT ANY 
PASSAGE OF DACA BE TIED TO 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING.
>> YEAH, THAT WAS CERTAINLY OUR 
REPORTING HERE, GEORGE, THAT THE
WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO STAND 
FIRM ON THAT AND NOT BUDGE.
THEY REALLY FELT LIKE THE 
DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO CAVE AND
COME UNDER FIRE.
AND REALLY THAT'S WHAT MANY OF 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FACING RIGHT 
NOW.
A LOT OF THE INITIAL REACTION 
COMING IN IS THAT PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING DEMOCRATS CAVED AND THEY 
SURRENDERED.
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT WILL 
PROBABLY TAKE A VICTORY LAP.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE 
HEAR FROM HIM SOON HERE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE.
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, MUCH 
OF THE NARRATIVE COMING OUT OF 
THESE NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE LAST
THREE AND FOUR DAYS IS EXACTLY 
WHAT CHUCK SCHUMER JUST SAID 
RIGHT THERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR,
THAT THE PRESIDENT -- HE CALLED 
HIM THE GREAT DEAL MAKER, GREAT 
DEAL-MAKING PRESIDENT BUT HE 
HADN'T ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO HIM 
SINCE LAST FRIDAY, AND WE DO 
KNOW FROM SOURCES HERE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE THAT WHILE THE 
PRESIDENT SPENT MANY OF THE LAST
FEW DAYS OF THIS WEEKEND IN THE 
OVAL OFFICE ON THE PHONE HE 
DIDN'T ACTUALLY CALL ANY 
DEMOCRATS.
SO YOU KNOW, THIS WILL CERTAINLY
BE THE NARRATIVE GOING FORWARD.
DID HE SIT ON THE SIDELINES TOO 
MUCH?
CAN HE REALLY TAKE THE CREDIT 
FOR THE RESULTS THAT WE ARE 
SEEING TODAY?
WE WILL SEE.
>> AND CAN THEY ACTUALLY GET TO 
AN AGREEMENT ON THE OVERALL 
IMMIGRATION ISSUES BETWEEN NOW 
AND FEBRUARY 8th?
OR WILL WE BE RIGHT BACK IN THE 
SAME SITUATION THREE WEEKS FROM 
NOW?
