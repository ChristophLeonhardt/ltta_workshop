Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble as his foul mouth talk about women continues to send shockwaves through the political sphere Republicans are shocked to find that the loud-mouthed abuse of Vulgarian they endorsed is a loudmouth abuse of Vulgarian with a videotape that makes them look bad for endorsing him it was one thing for me to degrade myself and throw away all my principles to support Trump said senator john mccain but if Trump is going to make me look like I'm degrading myself and throwing away all my principles then count me out McCain said he was withdrawing his support for Trump and shifting it to pee wee herman who has more dignity and acts more like an adult Trump voters who for years have been complaining that Republicans didn't know how to get down into the gutter to defeat Democrats are also shocked to discover that when they get down into the gutter to defeat Democrats there's actually no longer any point in defeating Democrats because they are Democrats and of course women who dress like sluts and allow famous rich men to treat them like dirt oh pardon me are shocked to find that famous rich men agha them and feel free to treat them like dirt feminists on the other hand who have demanded to be treated exactly like men are shocked to find out that now men have no respect for them feminists leader hildegard ban she said quote men are pigs and we want to be equal with them and then have men respect us for being women who are like men who were pigs when reporters mentioned that she was being irrational mizban she complained that they were privileged email trait of rationality over the female trait of blithering in a shrill voice and hoping men will give you what you want just to get some bloody peace and quiet executives at NBC who are in possession of the trump tape for eleven years before it was released said they were shocked to discover that they had known about the tape all the while they were making millions off Donald Trump's television show the executives swore that if they had only known they knew they would have fired themselves as it is they'll look sternly at themselves in the mirror and then forget the whole thing and of course no one could be more shocked than the news media former Clinton aide and now totally objective ABC news director George cycle abaqus said in a statement quote I got so used to romanticizing the adulteries of John Kennedy and ignoring the adulteries of Ted Kennedy and disguising the adulteries of Bill Clinton and rationalizing the abuse of women by Hillary Clinton that I'm totally shocked to be shocked at how shockingly shocked I'm shocked unquote Hillary Clinton said she hadn't been so shocked since last week when they used the defibrillation paddles to restart her heart and as for Donald Trump he said he was utterly shocked to find out how despicable he was and said he would now be voting for Hillary Clinton like everyone else in America trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan show stickety-boo so we need also sing shape tipsy Topsy no ruffled as if it easing it's a wonderful panic running round Deb Republicans running around back and forth shooting themselves in the foot sure to each other in the back stabbing each other in the back oh so it's October on in an election year it's a basically good typical your typical Republican October in a presidential election year all right we're on a little early today because I have to leave early and tomorrow is Yom Kippur so no one will be here uh yesterday you know I forgot yesterday was Columbus Day California don't we don't really do a lot of Columbus Day stuff cuz everybody picks on him you know because he conquered the indigenous people thereby violating Western values which we wouldn't have except for cleansed it's kind of like an infinite circle but anyway we I forgot about columbus day at but Yom Kippur is here I have to mention since it is Yom Kippur on ricochet this Orthodox Jewish writer Gil Reich worthley nicest piece about my book the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ and it's always difficult for Jews to read these books but I've noticed that the more orthodox they are the more religious they are the more understanding and sympathetic to the book they are and he points out he just has a lot of nice things about it you can go and see it on ricochet it's very very touching piece I thought and I was I was moved by all right so the GOP is falling apart basically Trump's poll numbers are tanking that little tough to tell at the moment because he did seem to have won the debate and of course the sex tape thing is everybody's going crazy over the sex tape thing and I'm truth there more to come the The Wall Street Journal had a poll that had him eleven percent 11 points behind Hillary Clinton that pole was a very small sample taken at a very weird time it was almost like a pole in the making but the RCP the Real Clear Politics average has her up between five and six percent which I'm probably is pretty close to it and that's that's huge in October so it is it'll things look better things look bad for the Donald you know think about that the thing about Donald who is reminds me of that old joke there used to be this old joke about a cartoonist who was a drunk and he wrote these this adventure cartoon so it was a serial and every day the hero would get in trouble and then the guy would get out of trouble and so he had this thing where the guy was in a pit and he's surrounded by snakes and you know the the walls are closing in spiked walls and lions are pacing around and he went off in a tear and he got drunk and nobody knew how to get this guy to get the hero out of this you know out of the pit Nova so they went searching for him all over town finally found them pumped him full of coffee you know brought him into the the cartoonist place and he vote in a single leap jon was free yeah that's Donald sharyl Attkisson is the great former the great investigative reporter at CBS wet to leave because they wouldn't let her report on Obama so she actually quit so she could do investigative reporting she wrote she sent out the abbreviated version of election coverage and one like this is Trump announces Trump announces his candidacy the coverage is this Trump is a clown from prism serious he's secretly trying to get Hillary elected we the media refused to cover his campaign we cover his campaign 24 7 the polls are abysmal he'll never last he'll get crushed he should apologize he should withdraw he's had his worst week ever Republicans are bailing on him he's too offensive his polls are dreadful Trump's campaign is over Trump is finished he should apologize he doesn't really want to win Republicans will fix the convention so he doesn't win Trump has zero chance of getting the nomination Trump wins the nomination that's that that was the coverage and it just goes on and she says it's basically the same with with Hillary just to stop for a moment and talk about these wikileaks letter from John Podesta you know nothing nothing has come out that is you know dreadfully corrupt about Hillary Clinton in this latest dump as so many this guy you know WikiLeaks doesn't really know what it's doing if it wants to manipulate the American press they just throw out thousands of emails you have to go but these are the emails from John Podesta the campaign the one that just got me though the is Podesta says yes Hillary does hate everyday Americans she has come to hate every day Americans it's like uh you know I don't know is that disqualifying you know you're gonna be President and you hate us yeah that's that's not all right but but you know so the media is continuing this cheryl cheryl atkinson vain they are declaring this over here is morning joe joe scarborough polling his very intelligent trio of campaign watchers john heilemann is this ray Selfridge Hillary Clinton ex-president United States absent some some dramatic eggs honest event yes I love by the way I love you know I mean I things can happen who are you know I mean yes one of them can get be Hillary couldnt get hit by a bus okay that's alright so absent is one or zero card is absent of being hit by a bus Hillary not metaphorically I mean we're still seeing you know dubbing I don't mean your kids Riley there could be something in one of these wikileaks dumps that turns out to be genuinely incriminating that I mean I'm not saying right you know absence in October Surprise a huge thing a huge Hillary Clinton President electrodynamics turlock Mark Halperin just to be clear I didn't say it was over last time you pulled everybody i said i said it was not or even when he was ten plays it over now it is over with barring some intervening event and also barring Donald Donald Trump has to start talking about what he would do to make the lives of Americans better Donald Trump's not gonna change you're gonna get a business a gangbang okay that's what if that's if that's the way he behaves right even even with some intervening event he can't win really ok wasted Hillary caught you think Hillary Clinton's next president I'd say if he keeps talking about this and not about how he'd make the lives of Americans better yes Mike Barnicle it's over okay you have it you know you don't even have to vote it's great i mean is and of course what's the thing that's really dramatic at this point is this civil war that's opening up in the Republican Party Paul Ryan came out and what he said was what he said was basically i'm not going to campaign with this guy anymore but i don't withdraw my endorsement so he's walking this fine line you have to remember look there's now a real possibility a real possibility that the GOP could lose either either the house or the senator both which would be pretty disastrous if these guys these down ticket guys you know congressmen senators come out and they say well we hate Trump now then the Trump voters turnout and remember there's forty five percent of the electorate the Trump voters turn up or whatever it is now 38 the Trump voters turn up and they'll vote for Trump but they won't vote for the down ticket guys meanwhile if you say no we still support from then the people who just find Trump appalling show up and they they won't show up they won't vote for you or or Trump and the senator is gone and that's really really a problem because you know and by the way Trump of course with his usual restraint in class and sense of you know Jawad avi is tweeting all these attacks on Ryan saying you know you ought to do something about the country the problems in the country instead of attacking me and today he tweeted I think it was this morning he tweeted I'm glad the shackles are off and I can finally fight for America I was like you know put the shackles back if this is you with the shackles off put the shackles back on dude it's like it's like Harambee you know haha thank God we tranquilized it down so here's the w the wall street journal editorial one irony of this election is that as mrs. Clinton has focused on disqualifying mr. Trump's character and temperament she's also released about a hundred and twelve thousand odd words of little notice policy proposals that a majority leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be only too happy to rubber-stamp see this is the thing about the way the press covers elections is it's all you know he grabs crotches and she has these emails but it's like what do these people stand for what will they do the journal goes on a new burst of liberal legislation could include a public auction option for Obamacare that would be one more giant leap toward government-run health care energy from fossil fuels would become stranded assets that is we wouldn't be able to frack and get the energy we need government by and for the regulatory state would accelerate and the Supreme Court would be lost to do to judicial conservatives for a generation a final irony is that a Pelosi Schumer Congress would readily pass the amnesty immigration bill that is animated mr. Trump's campaign so in other words by Trump blowing this election so badly more immigration will have the open borders that Hillary Clinton in these WikiLeaks says she wants I want in one of her speeches says she wants open borders that's her dream this prospect ought to concentrate Republican minds because House and Senate races are becoming more competitive as mr. Trump slips but of course we can't focus on that because we have to focus on Donald Trump talking about women's organs ok and you know I got I got like a lot of flak yesterday for basically saying I didn't care about this and I have to tell you I don't care about this I do not care this is not this is not to condone it this is not the condone it I have a real problem with these scandals let me read you something Dennis Prager wrote this morning and I'm sure you know I have this feeling we should probably do a debate show this week between me and Ben because I think Ben feels very differently about this and I really respect him I really respect what he feels but I just don't care I do not care about politician sex lines I don't have that much respect for them to begin with most many of them and I just want to know how they're going to run the government you know that's what that's what's important to me ok so Dennis Prager says regarding Donald Trump's private sexual comments we are living through a national hysteria to understand how and why it is necessary to understand the indispensable role hysteria plays on the left the left is always in major crisis mode and in nearly every case the crisis I is either wildly exaggerated or simply false you know this is true because nothing the left does works the only way they can take the power that they want take the power that they desire is to get you so hysterical that you're looking the other way or you think it's a crisis and they have to be given that power to save us all for example preggers goes on few people deny that the earth is warming to assert that is is not is hysteria what is hysteria is the left's position is not hysteria I'm sorry to assert that it is is not hysteria what is hysteria is the left's position that carbon emissions will destroy life on Earth that is absolutely correct the world is warming it does this from time to time many of our Lakes used to be glaciers you know many will be glaciers again we're on a rock circling into the Sun spiraling into the Sun it gets colder and it gets warmer the widespread protests against the name Washington Redskins pure left-wing hysteria they ended they were ended only by the revelation that polling through polling that the vast majority of American Indians couldn't care less about the name the examples are endless from the alleged epidemic of heterosexual aids in America and preschool mala station scares in the 80s to the wildly exaggerated dangers of secondhand smoke and the baseless fears about electronic cigarettes we are regularly forced to endure a new left-wing manufactured media supercharged hysteria the latest is the tsunami of horror in reaction to Donald Trump's gross and juvenile comments made in private 11 years ago the tsunami of condemnation of his remarks is quintessential left-wing hysteria that more that more than a few Republicans and conservatives have joined in is a testament to the power of mass media and hysteria to influence normally sense sensible people this is hysteria first and foremost because the comments were made in private they also need to ask themselves if it is worth giving the left wing giving the left the White House over such trivia then he goes on to say all the stuff that the Wall Street Journal says about what will happen if they win the house and senate and the presidency and is it worth losing all that to condemn Trump's sloppy behavior I got to say goodbye to the folks on Facebook and YouTube come on over to the daily wire there's more to come you
