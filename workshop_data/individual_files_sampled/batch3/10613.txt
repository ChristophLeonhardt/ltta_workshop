for the last three years Russian sport has been firmly sidelined as accusations mounted over state-sponsored doping the media has been in meltdown the BBC sports editor Dan Rowan tweeted out what he claimed was a letter from wadis compliance review committee saying Russ Aris prolonged suspension was already a done deal let's take a look at the whole picture just hours after owns report water published an official statement rubbishing these notions the world anti-doping agency's independent compliance review committee delivered a recommendation for the Reign statement of the Russian anti-doping agency wada also admitted it does not reveal information like that too often but it did so this time to put any speculation to bed it also openly said that the 31 conditions it had put forward to resada two years ago for reinstatement have been met conditions which included allowing UK anti-doping experts into Russian labs to provide training replacing the personnel monthly orders by wada among others with the two most contentious ones acknowledging the findings of the mclaren report and granting unconditional access to urine samples in russian laboratories which have been under federal investigation there those remained in limbo up until last week rolling forward a bit and the BBC then publishes a letter from the Russian Sports Minister to water where he agreed to all the demands and hoped that the world body would reinstate rusada so if that's the case and Russia has ticked off all the criteria why is everyone so mad I want to make sure this statement that they've attached over the last three years sticks even though Russia will be allowed back into sport they want to make sure that every time any commentator anywhere in the world mentions a Russian athlete they say that they'd served three years in exile because of doping violations and then want to emphasize that point to advertise to the rest of the world how tough water is and how difficult it can be to get round kind of the doping regulations in reality of course every sporting nation on the planet is engaged in some kind of doping violation it's just that they've been a bit cleverer about it the Russia or that Russia has simply been singled out as a kind of scapegoat and people are quitting their jobs because of it namely Becky Scott a retired Olympic champion in cross-country skiing who stepped down from the review panel after its recommendation to wada the possibility of Russia coming in from the cold is dividing the world anti-doping agency its vice president says she will vote against the reinstatement and she's being backed by Australia Canada the United Kingdom the USA and New Zealand who are all urging the agency's president to reconsider if you choose to reinstate Russia you defied the very wish of the athletes committees and organizations around the world have very clearly stated they will not accept a reinstatement now the sporting community around the world has spoken and the message is consistent and clear rusada cannot be declared compliant until all outstanding conditions set out in the roadmap have been satisfied we believe that any compromises to the roadmap will tarnish waters reputation and bring global sport into disrepute essentially rosado's revival is not set in stone and it could mean thousands of clean athletes in Russia will be hitting the first hurdle when it comes to entering competitions all over again with their respective Federation's hands tied until Rosario resumes its normal operations so will Thursday's decision by wada be influenced by sport politics or common sense you
