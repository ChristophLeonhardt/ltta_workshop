on a big cold eemiller so first of all do it like don't question yourself worst case they don't respond then who cares a couple of tricks first of all have like a catchy subject line it shouldn't be generic for people who called email me when it's a college student really interest in learning more about you that's pretty generic there's a million college students who are out there actually there's 20 2.5 million college students who are out there and so that's not you know super specific but when someone says let's just say I used to swim on the flying dolphins so fellow like former flying dolphin swimmer turned pen student model Congress lover wants to talk to you or something that shows that they did their research or someone who's interested in starting a company you know aspiring female entrepreneur interested in starting a company in the EdTech space or the HR tech space I think those are the things that are going to catch your eyes so subject line matters because otherwise you're not even going to get your email read and then once you get into email make it short crisp and say exactly what you want so if you see something like hi my name is Blaine I'm really interested in meeting with you because of XYZ can you have 15 minutes to hop on a phone call I think that that's going to be really impactful and get exactly what you want and and then in the PS line feel free to like make a funny comment or something to make them smile and have you stand out or put it in the email but have it short and crisp and to the point
