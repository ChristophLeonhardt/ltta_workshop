Mike yesterday you commented on John Kelly the position he's in a man who's given his life and protecting and defending the United States serving honorably losing a son in uniform now finding himself in a position where he's grimacing as Donald Trump undermines our NATO allies our European allies and yesterday in Helsinki defending the indefensible that is a KGB agents interference in American democracy how much longer does John Kelly stay in the White House as the situation worsens by the moment that's a good question Joe and it's unanswerable at least I can't answer it and I don't think general Kelly can answer it right now actually either he has a real moral dilemma here I mean there are people around this country who clearly disagree with his convictions on immigration things like that that's understandable but John Kelly is a man of honor and integrity who has sworn his life in in obeisance to the United States of America he took an oath of office himself as a Marine Corps officer and I imagine today he's very troubled at the fact that he sat in witnessed yesterday the President of the United States his boss the commander in chief betray the country in front of the world so general Kelly's choice is going to have to be made I mean he falls into what we were talking earlier Joe about you know am I so vital to the nation that if I leave I'll be replaced by someone a lesser individual than me that mindset can can take hold in any number of people around the president but general Kelly's decision is is a tough one but he's got to make it joining us now ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee Democratic congressman Adam Schiff of California and with us here on set in New York professor at Columbia University dr. Jeffrey Sachs gentlemen thanks for being with us congressman Schiff let me let me talk to you first as the ranking member on the Intel committee you know a lot you've seen a lot of information about what's happening Russia interference in the 2016 election and beyond you used words in your tweets yesterday watching the president's press conference damaging shameful and cowardly were you even surprised by what you saw yesterday despite all you know about this president I was surprised and I think many of us thought we'd lost the capacity to be shocked anymore but it was a stunning betrayal of the country and inexplicable at so many levels but whether there is this compromise on the president we don't know obviously we're trying to find out but he certainly acts like a president that is compromised and what ultimately matters to the country is how he acts and he acts like the Russians have something on him the only thing I'll say that runs in the opposite direction is if he were a longtime asset of the KGB as was posited in New York magazine a week or so ago his Russian handlers would be telling him wait slow down mr. president you'll give yourself away but but he it's hard to imagine him with a more damaging performance than we saw this week and if I could just comment on your last question I do think this is time for people in ministration to say that they're resigning and not just resigning in silence but saying they're resigning because they can't be they can't enable this kind of conduct and maybe through their resignation they could prompt some change in the president but I I think for many people administration now they need to think about the bigger service to the country by resigning in protest and lost in all of yesterday's news another indictment handed down but a Special Counsel after 12 came down on Friday dr. Sachs congressman uses the word damaging former director Brennan used the word dangerous as a practical matter why was it dangerous and damaging to see what the president did yesterday well I think we're out of control and foreign policy and it's in the hands of one completely unstable and unfit person we don't know whether what we're seeing is dementia psychopath II compromise but what we're seeing is extraordinary he's breaking the law he's breaking international trade and Congress and nobody has restrained him I what we saw yesterday was truly shocking but it's been now several weeks one day after the next of absolutely shocking actions I think his psychological state is really in question there's a lot of signs of dementia there's a lot of signs of deep personality disorder traits and it's extraordinarily worrisome I I would ask congressman Schiff who has done such a wonderful job of trying to keep track will the Republican side finally acknowledge how dangerous our situation is stop being an enabler of this danger support the Moller investigation which is utterly professional and clearly the finding some very very stark things are we going to get a hold of this or is this going to be a one-man show of a utterly unstable personality well I think sadly that you can't really count on the Congress and what we saw over the last 24 hours is yes there were some very strong statements from the usual suspects from John McCain and Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse a part from that though you had what passes for political courage these days you had Republicans saying this was a missed opportunity or a kind of anodyne statement saying I believe our intelligence agencies that's not exactly political backbone and certainly not the caliber of courage that we need to see from Republican members of Congress at the end of the day we could assert our institutional responsibility and stand up to this president but there's a little sign of that happening use you do see some of the members paddle from one side of the canoe they're questioning Peter's struck and attacking him like it's a Benghazi hearing all over again and then the next day they paddle from the other side of the canoe and say will we support our NATO alliance that's not going to cut it with the president this dangerous congressman it's ktk here I want to pick up on something that John Brennan was just talking about and ask you from what you know of the way these things are conducted would you think there would be some records some recording of that two-hour meeting from Donald Trump between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin either from the Russian side or even potentially from the American side I would certainly think that there would be a recording of this by the Russian side and I don't know what the circumstances were on the American side but from the Russian point of view if the president was saying that kind of stuff in public you can imagine how much worse it would be in private and if they can have a recorded conversation that that's more compromising you know first and foremost I want to study it to see what insights it shows into his character his personality any of the psychological issues that were just mentioned but they also might want it because they can throw it back in his face either publicly or privately should he deviate from Russian interests so I would certainly expect the Russians they have some kind of recording whether we do as well might depend on what this president was willing to allow all right thank you so much congressman Adam Schiff greatly appreciate you being here today and Jeffrey Sachs lay out if you will your your concerns your greatest concerns about where a trump presidency leads us as it as it pertains to America's alliances abroad and its national defense at home well I think the starting point is Trump demand and his psychological state he is unstable he shows very deep signs of personality disorders many people that I speak with the experts think that he's evidencing dementia and what is alarming about all of this is the extent to which our nation has become a one person game because as congressman Schiff just said Congress doesn't do anything but enable the Republican side should see right now this is not a partisan game this is putting our entire nation at risk the way that the Republicans have been enabling this man we have a one person wrecking ball right now that is going to destroy global trade through his individual ignorance and whims we have a one person wrecking ball who is undermining every alliance and the public's abroad and I'm traveling relentlessly in Europe and Asia our stunn they want to have nothing to do with our country it's it's not just Trump he is breaking alliances he is endangering our Security's endangering our economy and he psychologically absolutely unfit for office and for God's sake it's time that the Republicans in Congress understand that by enabling this they are putting the entire country at jeopardy we'll see if they provide more than tweets today and follow up on it dr.
