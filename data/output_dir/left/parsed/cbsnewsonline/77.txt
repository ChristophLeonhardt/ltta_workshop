>>> HELLO EVERYONE, I AM ELAINE 
QUIJANO,  WELCOME TO CBSN'S  
SPECIAL ELECTION NIGHT COVERAGE 
OF THE FLORIDA AND ARIZONA 
PRIMARIES. 
THIS IS THE LAST BIG PRIMARY 
DAY BEFORE THE NOVEMBER 
ELECTIONS. 
TONIGHT'S RESULTS WILL DECIDE 
MIDTERM MATCH UPS FOR GOVERNOR, 
SENATE, AND THE HOUSE. 
IN ARIZONA, POLLS WILL CLOSE IN 
ABOUT AN HOUR. 
THE STATES REPUBLICAN SENATE 
RACE HAS RECEIVED ENORMOUS 
ATTENTION. IT FEATURES THREE 
CANDIDATES THAT HAVE VIED FOR 
THE PRESIDENTS ENDORSEMENT BUT 
HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. 
THEY ARE RUNNING TO REPLACE 
JEFF FLAKE, WHO IS RETIRING. 
THE RACE IN ARIZONA IS 
HAPPENING IN THE SHADOW OF 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S PASSING. 
THE LONGTIME REPUBLICAN ARIZONA 
SEAT IS NOT UP FOR GRABS, BUT 
IT HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE 
FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
MEANWHILE, IN FLORIDA RESULTS 
ARE TRICKLING IN. 
THE REPUBLICAN RACE FOR 
GOVERNOR HAS BEEN SEEN AS A 
TEST OF THE PRESIDENTS 
ENDORSEMENT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP BACKED  
DESANTIS IN THE PRIMARY. 
TONIGHT,  CBS NEWS IS  
PROJECTING DESANTIS AS THE 
WINNER. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP  CONGRATULATED 
DESANTIS ON TWITTER, CALLING IT 
A FANTASTIC WIN. 
MEANWHILE,  IN THE SENATE RACE, 
RICK SCOTT HAS WON HIS PRIMARY, 
WHICH MEANS HE WILL FACE OFF 
AGAINST INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC 
SENATOR BILL NELSON. 
THAT IS NOT EVEN INCLUDE THE 
HOUSE RACES WE WILL TRACK AS 
WELL AS THE INTERESTING 
STORYLINES ON THE DEMOCRATIC 
SIDE. 
WE HAVE A POWERHOUSE PANEL TO 
COVER EVERY ASPECT OF TONIGHT'S 
RACES. 
CBS NEWS POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT, ED O'KEEFE . 
KATELYN HEB BURNS IS A 
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR FOR REAL 
CLEAR POLITICS. 
AND ONE SEE RIGHT IS A 
POLITICAL STRATEGIST THAT 
ADVISED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. 
HE IS ALSO THE CEO OF BLUEPRINT 
STRATEGY. 
NANCY SANCHEZ IS A CONTRIBUTOR 
AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST. 
BUT FIRST, LET'S GET TO JIM TO 
CD IN MIAMI. 
HE IS A CORRESPONDENT WITH OUR 
CBS STATION -- I'M SO THANKFUL 
THAT WE HAVE YOUR INSIDE. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT DESANTIS FIRST 
OF ALL. 
HE HAS DEFEATED  ADAM PUTNAM TO 
WIN THE  GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY. 
HOW CRUCIAL WAS THE PRESIDENTS 
ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE? 
FOR A LONG TIME, ADAM PUTNAM 
HAD THE LEAD.  
THEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED 
ABOUT  DESANTIS AND THINGS 
CHANGED.  
>> OH, THE DIFFERENCES A SINGLE 
TWEET CAN MAKE. 
RON DESANTIS WAS BEHIND, THEN 
SUDDENLY THE  PRESIDENT CAME 
ALONG, SUPPORTED HIM WITH A 
TWEET. 
THAT TWEET HAD A LOT OF 
AFFECTS. 
ONE OF THE EFFECTS WAS THAT IT 
GAVE A SIGNAL TO REPUBLICAN 
DONORS, BIG DONORS, ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY TO START DONATING MONEY 
TO RON DESANTIS. 
THAT PROVED USEFUL FOR HIM. 
BUT ALSO DESANTIS WAS FAMILIAR 
WITH THE GOP TRIPE  -- TYPE 
PRIMARY VOTER. 
HE RAN A CAMPAIGN OF LARGELY 
GOING -- NOT OPERATING A GROUND 
GAME, BUT GOING THROUGH THE 
AIR. 
HE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO IT. 
HE EMBRACED DONALD TRUMP, HE 
NEVER SHIED AWAY. 
IT GOT HIM THE REPUBLICAN 
NOMINATION. 
NOW WE WILL SEE WHAT IT DOES IN 
THE GENERAL ELECTION, WHEN 
DEMOCRATS WILL TRY TO HANG 
DONALD TRUMP AROUND HIS NECK. 
>> IS THIS A LIVE PICTURE OF 
DESANTIS? 
JIM, ARE YOU OKAY TO LISTEN IN 
FOR A MOMENT?  
>> SURE. 
>> -- REALIZE THIS VISION, IS 
EXERCISE LEADERSHIP. 
MOST PEOPLE WHO GET ELECTED TO 
PUBLIC OFFICE ARE NOT LEADERS. 
MOST OF THEM ARE POLITICIANS. 
A LEADER IS SOMEBODY WHO IS 
WILLING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT, 
EVEN WHEN IT IS NOT EASY, EVEN 
WHEN IT IS POLITICALLY 
DIFFICULT. 
IF YOU LOOK AT MY TRACK RECORD, 
FROM ATHLETICS TO THE MILITARY, 
TO FIGHTING TO DRAIN THE SWAMP 
IN WASHINGTON, I HAVE BEEN 
WILLING TO TAKE THE TOP STANDS, 
THE PRINCIPLED POSITIONS, EVEN 
WHEN IT WAS DETRIMENTAL TO ME 
POLITICALLY. 
I HAD MORE MONEY SPENT 
NEGATIVELY ON ME THAN ALL THE 
OTHER CANDIDATES COMBINED ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. 
THAT IS FINE, I AM WILLING TO 
STAND UP, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT 
STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
FLORIDA IS THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO. 
SO I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE THERE 
IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN 
ACCOMPLISH HERE, AS LONG AS YOU 
HAVE THE COURAGE TO LEAD. 
AND I PLEDGE TO YOU, AS 
GOVERNOR, I WILL WORK MY BUTT 
OFF TO ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS 
FOR THIS STATE, I WILL SHOW THE 
COURAGE TO LEAD, AND WE WILL 
KEEP FLORIDA GREAT AND MAKE IT 
EVEN GREATER. 
GOD BLESS YOU GUYS, THANK YOU 
SO MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> THERE, YOU HEARD HIM, 
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS IN HIS 
VICTORY SPEECH IN ORLANDO 
FLORIDA.  
JIM, YOU ARE STILL WITH US. 
TELL US WHAT THE STRATEGY WAS. 
THE STRATEGY THAT ALLOWED HIM 
TO BE A VICTOR AGAINST A 
CANDIDATE WHO WAS VERY MUCH 
PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. 
ADAM PUTNAM IS A NAME THAT IS 
WELL KNOWN IN FLORIDA POLITICS. 
>> WELCOME UNFORTUNATELY BEING 
PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT DOES 
NOT GET YOU FAR THESE DAYS IN 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
ESPECIALLY HERE IN FLORIDA. 
YOU KNOW, ADAM PUTNAM , HIS 
OPPONENT WAS CUT FROM THE JEB 
BUSH CLOTH, YOU SAW WHAT 
HAPPENED IN 2016. 
DONALD TRUMP CAME IN AND WIPED 
AWAY JEB BUSH'S LEGACY IN THE 
STATE WHEN IT CAME TO POLITICS. 
YOU KNOW, RON DESANTIS DID THE 
SAME THING WITH ADAM PUTNAM.  
THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE NOW. 
YOU ARE SEEING THAT THIS IS THE 
COMPLETE TAKEOVER OF THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN FLORIDA OF 
THE DONALD TRUMP ERA. 
>> WE SAW IN FACT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP COME TO TAMPA  AND 
ACTUALLY RALLY ON BEHALF OF RON 
DESANTIS. 
HOW MUCH OF A FACTOR DO YOU 
THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AS 
WELL?  
>> THAT WAS A BIG PART OF IT. 
I THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
SEE THE PRESIDENT DOWN HERE A 
WHOLE LOT. 
WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING IS THE 
DYNAMIC. 
RON DESANTIS WILL EMBRACE  
PRESIDENT TRUMP , HE WILL 
CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP. 
IT WILL BE TRICKIER FOR RICK 
SCOTT, THE SENATE NOMINEE, 
RUNNING AGAINST BILL NELSON. 
SCOTT HAS TRIED NOT TO 
NECESSARILY DISTANCE HIMSELF 
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT HE 
HAS NOT EMBRACED HIM THE WAY 
THAT  RON DESANTIS HAD. 
THERE COULD BE  INTERESTING 
JOCKEYING IN TERMS OF WHAT 
EVENTS THE CURRENT GOVERNOR 
GOES TO IN HIS SENATE RACE WHEN 
IT COMES TO THE PRESIDENT, BUT 
I EXPECT TO SEE HIM DOWN HERE A 
LOT. 
>>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHEN IT COMES 
TO THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. 
GWEN GRAHAM WAS CONSIDERED THE 
FAVORITE ,  BUT ANDREW GILLUM 
IS EXCEEDING  EXPECTATIONS. 
HOW SURPRISING IS THAT TO YOU? 
>> LOOK, ANDREW GILLUM IS MORE 
THAN EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS. 
THE LATEST NUMBERS, HE IS 
WINNING. 
HE IS AHEAD RIGHT NOW.  
THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST STORIES IN THE COUNTRY 
TONIGHT, ANDREW GILLUM , AN 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WHO IS NOT A 
MILLIONAIRE. 
EVERY OTHER CANDIDATE ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WAS. 
THEY EVEN HAD A BILLIONAIRE 
RUNNING AND PROVING THAT HE 
COULD WIN THIS RACE. 
NOW, THERE ARE THREE FACTORS 
THAT I THINK PLAYED A KEY ROLE 
IN ANDREW GILLUM'S SURGE AND 
WHY HE IS IN THE LEAD. 
WE ARE NOT CALLING THAT FOR HIM 
YET, BUT HE IS AHEAD  BY A 
SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN. 
THE THREE FACTORS ARE -- BERNIE 
SANDERS CAME IN AND CAMPAIGNED 
WITH HIM. 
THAT WAS A HUGE ENDORSEMENT FOR 
ANDREW GILLUM. 
THAT GAVE HIM THE PROGRESSIVE 
LABEL. 
BERNIE SANDERS , APPEARING WITH 
HIM WAS KEY. 
IT ALSO MEANT THAT A LOT OF 
THAT PROGRESSIVE MONEY CAME IN. 
WHETHER IT WAS FROM TOM STEIN 
OR OTHERS THAT CAME IN AND 
SUPPORTED HIM. 
THE OTHER THING THAT WAS 
PIVOTAL, THE STATES STAND YOUR 
GROUND LAW. 
ANDREW GILLUM WAS AN EARLY 
OPPONENT OF STAND YOUR GROUND. 
HE MADE THAT A CENTRAL PART OF 
HIS CAMPAIGN.  
I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS SAW 
ANDREW GILLUM'S OPPOSITION AS 
BEING SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD 
EMBRACE  AND REALLY GET BEHIND. 
AND THE THIRD THING, AND YOU 
CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS -- 
THERE WAS SO MUCH NEGATIVE 
ADVERTISING SPEND, BUT NONE OF 
IT AGAINST ANDREW GILLUM.  
WHAT YOU HAD WAS -- GWEN GRAHAM 
RUNNING ATTACK AS AGAINST OTHER 
CANDIDATES.  
JEFF GREEN, THEY WERE ALL 
RUNNING ATTACK ADS AGAINST EACH 
OTHER BUT NOBODY WAS TAKING A 
PUNCH AT ANDREW GUILLEN. 
IT WAS FOR A FEW THINGS. 
ONE, HE WAS TRADITIONALLY 
FOURTH AND MOST OF THE POLLS, 
SO HE WAS NOT LEADING. 
NOBODY WANTED TO PUNCH DOWN AND 
NOBODY WANTED TO BE IN THE 
POSITION OF ATTACKING AN 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CANDIDATE, 
KNOWING HOW VITAL THAT VOTE 
WOULD BE  FOR THEM IN NOVEMBER. 
WELL, THAT STRATEGY OF KEEPING 
THEIR HANDS OFF OF ANDREW 
GILLUM APPEARS TO HAVE  
BACKFIRED ON GWEN GRAHAM AND 
RIGHT NOW HE IS AHEAD.  
>> JIM, WE HAVE AT O'KEEFE HERE 
WHO WANTS TO ASK YOU A 
QUESTION. 
>> JIM, IF THE CONVENTIONAL 
WISDOM WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO 
BE GWEN GRAHAM, WHO IS SEEN AS 
A MODERATE , MORE EXPERIENCED 
POLITICAL FIGURE, RUNNING 
AGAINST RON DESANTIS , THE 39-
YEAR-OLD CONGRESSMAN WHO 
BASICALLY WON THE REPUBLICAN 
PRIMARY BY APPEARING AS OFTEN 
AS HE COULD ON FOX NEWS. 
IF YOU SET UP A RACE BETWEEN A 
39-YEAR-OLD TRUMP BACKED 
REPUBLICA AND A 39-YEAR-OLD 
MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE, WHO DID 
IT ON THE BACK OF BERNIE 
SANDERS, THAT SCRAMBLES THINGS 
IN A WAY THAT PERHAPS FLORIDA 
HAS NOT SEEN BEFORE, BECAUSE 
YOU WILL HAVE A REAL PARTISAN 
REPUBLICAN RUNNING AGAINST A 
REAL PARTISAN LIBERAL DEMOCRAT. 
>> WHAT IS TRULY AMAZING IS -- 
THE DEMOCRATS GOT EXACTLY THE 
CANDIDATE THEY WANTED ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THE 
REPUBLICANS GOT EXACTLY THE 
CANDIDATE THEY WANTED ON THE 
DEMOCRAT SIDE. 
EACH ARE WAITING TO TEAR INTO 
THE OTHER. 
I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE -- 
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A VERY 
NASTY RACE IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE AN 
EXPENSIVE RACE. 
YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF 
PROGRESSIVE MONEY COMING TO THE 
STATE. 
YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF 
CONSERVATIVE MONEY COME INTO 
THE STATE. 
AND WHERE DOES THAT CENTER GO? 
YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
LOST THE LAST FIVE GOVERNORS 
RACES BY NARROW MARGINS. 
AS I SAID IN THE LAST HOUR WHEN 
I WAS WITH YOU, FOUR YEARS AGO, 
THERE WERE ALMOST 6 MILLION 
VOTES CAST. 
THE SEPARATION WAS ABOUT 60,000 
VOTES. 
EIGHT YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A 
LITTLE MORE THAN 5 MILLION 
VOTES CAST, IT WAS ABOUT 60,000 
VOTES. 
THE THINKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- 
THE DEMOCRATS ELECT A MODERATE 
DEMOCRAT TO RUN IN THE PRIMARY, 
HOPING THAT THEY CAN DRAW 
VOTERS. 
THE ARGUMENT THAT ANDREW GILLUM 
HAS ALWAYS MADE IS THAT WE HAVE 
DONE ENOUGH  WITH NOMINATING 
MODERATE DEMOCRATS TO DRAW OFF 
REPUBLICAN VOTERS. 
WHAT YOU NEEDED TO DO WAS 
NOMINATE A TRUE PROGRESSIVE, 
ENERGIZE THAT PROGRESSIVE BASE, 
BRING OUT HISPANICS AND BLACKS, 
BRING THE TO THE POLLS, AND 
WIN IN THE SAME WAY THAT OBAMA 
DID IN FLORIDA WHEN HE RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT. 
>> IT IS THE SAME ARGUMENT THAT 
STACEY ABRAMS  WAS MAKING TO 
THE NORTH OF GEORGIA. 
IF YOU COULD BRING OUT THE 
DEMOCRATS YOU COULD WIN A 
STATEWIDE RACE. 
WE WILL SEE THAT HAPPENS IN 
FLORIDA. 
THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS 
-- TODAY IS THE LAST DAY OF 
VOTING IN FLORIDA. 
NEARLY 2 MILLION BALLOTS HAVE 
BEEN CAST AS OF YESTERDAY, 
WHICH IS A HUGE SOME, AND MORE 
THAN USUAL, RIGHT? 
>> NO, WE ARE SEEING A LEVEL OF 
EXCITEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE.
RECORD-BREAKING. 
I KNOW THAT IN A NUMBER OF 
COUNTIES THAT I LOOKED AT 
BEFORE COMING ON, THEY'RE 
SETTING RECORD TURNOUT. 
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, 
MIAMI-DADE. I LOOKED AT THOSE 
NUMBERS, YOU KNOW -- THE VOTE 
AMONG REPUBLICANS IN MIAMI-DADE 
IS UP 31%. 
YOU WOUL THINK THAT IS GREAT 
FOR REPUBLICANS, UNTIL YOU 
úREA 
VOTE FROM FOUR YEARS AGO WAS UP 
71%. 
YOU ARE SEEING EXCITEMENT ON 
BOTH SIDES. 
THE NOTION OF SUPPRESSING A 
REPUBLICAN VOTE, OR NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO GET -- LOOK, THERE IS 
GOING TO BE -- THIS IS GOING TO 
BE A MAJOR ELECTION IN 
NOVEMBER. 
I HAVE HEARD ONE OF YOUR GUESTS 
EARLIER TALK ABOUT THIS BEING 
THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL MIDTERM 
ELECTION IN HIS LIFETIME. 
I THINK I FEEL THE SAME WAY. 
THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE. 
I THINK THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD 
LOWER VOTERS INTO NOT TURNING 
OUT IS A MISTAKE. 
IT WILL BE A HIGH TURNOUT 
ELECTION. 
JUST LIKE IN PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS, IT WILL COME DOWN TO 
A RAZOR THIN MARGIN IN 
NOVEMBER. 
>> LET'S TURN TO THE SENATE 
RACE, RICK SCOTT HAS EASILY WON 
HIS PARTY PRIMARY, SETTING THE 
STAGE FOR A HIGHLY ANTICIPATED 
RACE AGAINST INCUMBENT 
DEMOCRAT, SENATOR BILL NELSON. 
HOW RARE IS IT TO CA U.S. 
SENATE OR SQUARE OFF AGAINST A 
SITTING GOVERNOR? 
>> THAT IS RARE, BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY -- RICK SCOTT HAS 
THE MONEY TO MAKE THIS A REALLY 
COMPETITIVE RACE. 
MOST OF THE EARLY POLLING HAS 
RICK SCOTT AHEAD. 
BILL NELSON, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ARE WONDERINGÃWHAT KIND OF 
CAMPAIGN IS HE RUNNING? 
HIS STAFF TELLS ME THAT THEY 
ARE HOLDING THEIR POWDER. 
THEY KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT 
OUTSPEND THE REPUBLICANS, SO 
THEY ARE KEEPING THEIR MONEY 
BACK UNTIL IT REALLY COUNTS, 
STARTING IN SEPTEMBER. 
AND THEN IN OCTOBER THEY WILL 
BE ON THE AIR. 
BUT, RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNOR HAS 
HAD TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
OF ADS ATTACKING THE SITTING 
SENATOR, BASICALLY TRYING TO 
MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT HE IS 
TOO OLD. 
HE HAS CALLED HIM CONFUSED AT 
TIME. 
SO, YOU WILL SEE THIS TURN INTO 
A NASTY RACE AS WELL. 
IF I COULD THROW ONE OTHER 
THING -- I THINK THAT OVER ALL 
OF THESE RACES, YOU ARE SEEING 
THE STONEMAN DOUGLAS TRAGEDY 
PLAY OUT AS WELL. 
YOU WILL SEE THIS IN 
CONGRESSIONAL RACES, YOU ARE 
SEEING IT IN THE SENATE RACE. 
THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. 
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE -- 
IN BROWARD COUNTY, NORMALLY WE 
DO NOT SPEND A LOT OF TIME 
LOOKING AT SCHOOL BOARD RACES 
NATIONALLY, BUT ONE OF THE 
PARENTS OF THE STONEMAN DOUGLAS 
TRAGEDY, ONE OF THE PARENTS WHO 
LOST A DAUGHTER WAS ELECTED TO 
THE SCHOOL BOARD. 
SHE IS A POLITICAL NEOPHYTE, 
NEVER HAD ANY EXPERIENCE 
WHATSOEVER. 
SHE RAN, SHE NOW WILL SERVE ON 
THE SCHOOL BOARD. 
IT IS A NEW DAY AND THIS IS 
GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING 
ISSUE AND A LOT OF RACES AT THE 
LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL 
LEVEL. 
>> JIM, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR 
YOUR ANALYSIS AND INSIGHT. 
>> ANYTIME. 
>> LET'S TURN TO OUR PANEL. 
WAS TALK ABOUT WHAT WE JUST 
HEARD. 
AND, IT WAS INTERESTING -- YOU 
KNOW, THE FACT THAT BILL NELSON 
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF 
NAME RECOGNITION, CAN WE TALK 
ABOUT THAT? 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD 
APPEAR TO BE SOMETHING OF A 
LITTLE BIT OF A MYSTERY. 
>> WELL, IT SPEAKS TO FLORIDA. 
REMEMBER, THIS IS A TRANSIENT 
STATE WHERE YOU HAVE RETIREES 
CYCLING THROUGH EVERY FEW 
YEARS. 
WHEN YOU ARE ON THE BALLOT ONCE 
EVERY SIX YEARS, THERE IS 
INEVITABLY GOING TO BE CHURNED 
IN A STATE WHERE THEY MOVE IN, 
THEY DIE AND A NEW BATCH OF 
RETIREES MOVE IN. 
THAT IS WHAT IT IS. 
>> ED O'KEEFE -- AT IS YOUR 
PART OF THE SHOW. 
>> THE OTHER PART IS THE INFLUX 
OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES. 
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PUERTO RICANS 
THAT HAVE MOVED INTO THE STATE. 
IF THEY REGISTER TO VOTE THEY 
BECOME A FACTOR. 
IT IS HARD. 
THIS IS A STATE THAT IN ONE WAY 
OR ANOTHER TOUCHES 10 MEDIA 
MARKETS. 
YOU HAVE TO SPEND AS MUCH AS 
EIGHT FIGURES IN ORDER TO 
ADVERTISE EFFECTIVELY IN THE 
STATE. 
AND NELSON DOES NOT HAVE THAT 
KIND OF MONEY. 
NOT IN A YEAR WHEN DEMOCRATS 
HAVE TO DEFEND 10 SEATS IN 10 
STATES THAT DONALD TRUMP ONE IN 
2016. 
THEY HAVE TO PICK AND CHOOSE. 
AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, THEY'RE 
WAITING UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT 
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
WANT TO THROW ALL OF THEIR 
MONEY INTO FLORIDA, OR LET BILL 
NELSON WEATHER ON THE VINE AND 
FIGHT FOR HIMSELF . 
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT, AS A 
STRATEGY? 
YOU DO HAVE AN OPPONENT IN 
GOVERNOR SCOTT THAT HAS VERY 
DEEP POCKETS. 
WHAT ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT 
THEY MAY BE HOLDING BACK A 
LITTLE BIT AND TRYING TO BE 
STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW THEY SPEND 
THEIR MONEY? 
>> JUST LIKE ANDREW GILLUM, 
WHEN IT COMES TO BILL NELSON, 
WHEN PEOPLE COUNT HIM OUT  HE 
WILL TEACH PEOPLE THAT THEY 
DON'T KNOW HOW TO COUNT. 
I BELIEVE THAT ABOUT HIM. 
LOOK, I THINK ED IS RIGHT ABOUT 
THE TRANSIENT POPULATION MOVING 
IN AND OUT. 
BUT, WHAT YOU CANNOT 
UNDERESTIMATE IS THE FACT THAT 
PRIMARIES ARE LIKE SCRIMMAGES. 
THEY DETERMINE WHO WILL BE ON 
THE FIELD FOR THE BIG GAME IN 
THE GENERAL ELECTION. 
WHAT PLAYS YOU RUN BEFORE THE 
BIG GAME WILL DETERMINE WHO 
WINS. 
NOW, RICK SCOTT AND BILL NELSON 
HAVE TO HAVE POLICY DISCUSSIONS 
IN ORDER TO CONVINCE FOLKS TO 
VOTE FOR THEM. 
THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR OF 
FLORIDA FAILED TO ACT ON MANY 
FRONTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF 
FLORIDA IS GOING TO BE A 
LIABILITY FOR HIM IN NOVEMBER. 
AND HE HAS TO CONVINCE 
MODERATES, AS WELL AS THE 
EXTREME WING OF THE REPUBLICAN  
TWO STEPS AWAY FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT.  
THE FACT THAT IF ANDREW GILLUM 
IS THE WINNER OF THE PRIMARY 
FOR GOVERNOR, YOU'RE GOING TO 
HAVE  A SURGE IN BLACK AND 
BROWN TURNOUT FOR THE SIMPLE 
FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME 
TO THE RESCUE OF THEIR OWN. 
YOU CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THAT. 
THE OTHER THING THAT YOU CANNOT 
UNDERESTIMATE IS THE NEWFOUND 
LOVE WITH YOUNG VOTERS IN 
FLORIDA THAT ARE DISAPPOINTED 
IN THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT 
THAT -- FOR FAILING TO DO 
SOMETHING FOR GUN VIOLENCE. 
>> LET ME ASK LESLIE, GOVERNOR 
SCOTTÃI SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS TWEETED  CONGRATULATIONS TO 
BOTH SCOTT AND RON DESANTIS.  
SO, YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR, RIGHT? 
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN RICK SCOTT 
THAT IS TRYING TO WALK A LINE. 
ON THE ONE HAND, UNDERSTAND THE 
POWER OF THE TRUMP EFFECT ON 
REPUBLICANS. 
ON THE OTHER, WHEN YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT A GENERAL ELECTION
, IT BECOMES A DIFFERENT 
CALCULATION, DOESN'T IT? 
SO, DO HAVE THE TWEET ALSO FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, JUST SO THAT 
WE CAN SHOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW,  
HE CONGRATULATED GOVERNOR 
SCOTT, AND HE SAID 
CONGRATULATIONS TO GOVERNOR 
RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA ON HIS 
CONCLUSIVE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY 
WIN. 
HE WILL BE A GREAT SENATOR. 
WHAT IS THE CALCULUS NOW FOR 
GOVERNOR SCOTT, GOING INTO 
NOVEMBER? 
>> YOU KNOW, THE BIG QUESTION I 
THINK -- AND, MOSTLY HIS 
CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES ARE TRYING 
TO DO THE MATH RIGHT NOW AND 
DETERMINE IF THEY CAN PICK UP 
THOSE MODERATES. 
CAN THEY PICK UP THOSE ETHNIC 
MINORITY VOTERS THAT TEND TO BE 
MORE CONSERVATIVE THAT WOULD GO 
AND GET THAT BASE TRUMP SUPPORT 
AS WELL? 
AND I THINK THAT ANY CANDIDATE 
THAT HAS NOT WHOLEHEARTEDLY 
EMBRACE THE PRESIDENT, 
ESPECIALLY NOW, ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE, IS GOING TO 
REALLY BE IN A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION, BECAUSE THE ONES WHO 
HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT FULL 
BEARHUG ARE THE ONES THAT ARE 
PREVAILING. 
AND FLORIDA WILL BE JUST LIKE 
EVERY OTHER STATE. 
>> IN THE PRIMARY -- 
>> YES, BUT AS MUCH IS THE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL  GALVANIZE 
HIS BASE TO REALLY GET OUT 
THERE AND MAKE THIS 
COMPETITIVE, THOSE VOTERS ARE 
GOING TO TURN OUT FOR SCOTT. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP  REPORTEDLY 
CALLED THE ELECTIONS A 
REFERENDUM ON HIM. 
HE WARNED THAT IF THE GOP 
LOSES, THERE WILL BE VIOLENCE. 
ED, YOU SPOKE TO A GROUP OF 
VOTERS LAST NIGHT ABOUT THEIR 
ISSUES. 
I WANT TO PLAY SOME OF THAT. 
>> IMMIGRATION, HEALTHCARE, AND 
THE ECONOMY. 
THOSE ARE MY TOP THREE. 
>> IMMIGRATION, WE NEED TO KEEP 
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND 
POSSIBLY EVEN INCREASE THE 
NUMBERS IN BOTH HOUSES OF 
CONGRESS SO THAT TRUMP CAN GET 
HIS AGENDA PUSHED THROUGH. 
>> MORE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS 
WOULD HELP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. 
>> WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE 
DRIVING YOU TO THE POLLS? 
>> THE SILLY TALK BY THE 
DEMOCRATS OF IMPEACHING THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> SO YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE 
PRESIDENT? 
IT IS PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT 
THEN? 
>> THAT IS SOMETHING VERY 
IMPORTANT AND I WANT THE 
ECONOMY TO CONTINUE THE WAY 
THAT IT IS GOING. 
I THINK WITH MORE REPUBLICANS 
IN CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT WILL 
BE ABLE TO PASS HIS AGENDA MORE 
FREELY. 
>> ARE YOU PLANNING TO VOTE? 
WHAT IS THE MAIN REASON WHY? 
>> THE MAIN REASON WHY? 
JUST TO VOTE DEMOCRAT. 
I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY IT 
HAS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT. WE DO 
NOT HAVE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, 
WE DON'T HAVE CONGRESS, AND WE 
DON'T HAVE THE COURTS. 
AND THE CHECKS AND BALANCES IS 
SKEWED ONE WAY. 
>> SO, HOW DOES THIS BECOME A 
REFERENDUM ON PRESIDENT TRUMP?  
>> I WILL TELL YOU, IN MY 
TRAVELS TO FLORIDA, ARIZONA, 
OHIO, VERMONT -- HE COMES UP 
UNPROMPTED. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ANYMORE. 
THE VOTERS ARE BRINGING IT UP 
FOR YOU. 
SO, WHETHER REPUBLICANS AND 
DEMOCRATS LIKE IT, HE IS GOING 
TO BE AN ISSUE. 
HE IS GOING TO BE ON THE 
BALLOT, WHICH IS WHY THE RACES 
IN FLORIDA FOR GOVERNOR AND 
SENATE COULD BE INTERESTING, 
SINCE HE IS SO CLOSELY ALIGNED 
WITH BOTH OF THE GOP NOMINEES 
THERE. 
IT WAS TELLING. 
WE WILL TALK TONIGHT AND WE 
WILL HEAR TALK IN THE COMING 
WEEKS ABOUT GUNS IN FLORIDA, 
ESPECIALLY SOUTH FLORIDA. 
THERE WAS A GATHERING OF FOLKS 
OUTSIDE MIAMI. 
I ASKED THEM ABOUT PARKLAND, 
WHICH HAD HAPPENED ABOUT ONE 
HOUR NORTH AND WHETHER OR NOT 
IT WOULD BE AN ISSUE. 
TO A PERSON, THE DEMOCRATS SAID 
NO, WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE 
THIS MOVING THE NEEDLE AT ALL 
IN TERMS OF THOSE STUDENTS FROM 
PARKLAND TRAVELING THE COUNTRY 
TRYING TO MAKE IT AN ISSUE. 
BE THAT IS DISPROVEN IN THE 
RESULTS IF ANDREW GILLUM 
PREVAILS AND WE FIND OUT THAT 
PEOPLE SHOWED UP IN PART 
BECAUSE OF HIS  OPPOSITION TO 
STAND YOUR GROUND AND THE STATES
GUN CONTROL POLICY. 
BUT IT WAS TELLING THAT ISSUE 
WAS DISMISSED, BUT IMMIGRATIN, 
WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT OR PROTECT THE 
PRESIDENT, AND THE ECONOMY 
CERTAINLY ON THE MINDS OF 
VOTERS DOWN THERE. 
>> YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW 
MUCH THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO 
BE ACTIVE. JUST LAST WEEK WE 
WERE SPEAKING WITH WHITE HOUSE 
OFFICIALS THAT SAID THIS 
PRESIDENT WANTS TO BE MORE 
ACTIVE THAN OBAMA WAS, LAST 
TIME AROUND HE LOVES 
CAMPAIGNING, WE KNOW THAT HE 
RELISHES THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO 
OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND 
MOSTLY DEFEND HIMSELF AND THE 
IN FRONT OF WELCOMING CROWDS 
AND TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT HE 
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT, WHICH 
MIGHT NOT BE THINGS THAT MOST 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT, BUT HE WILL BE 
ACTIVE. 
THAT GIVES REPUBLICANS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO RALLY THEIR 
BASE, BUT COMES WITH THE RISK 
OF DOING MORE TO RALLY UP THE 
OTHER SIDE IF THAT IS EVEN 
POSSIBLE AT THIS POINT. 
BUT, KEEP THAT IN MIND. 
HE WILL BE SPENDING A LOT OF 
TIME IN FLORIDA AS WE KNOW, HE 
VISITS THERE IN THE WINTER 
ANYWAY. HE LOVES THAT STATE, HE 
LOVES GOING THERE. 
HE LOVES RON DESANTIS. 
HE IS GOING TO BE CAMPAIGNING A 
LOT, WHICH IS SOMETHING TO 
CONSIDER . 
>> ANTOINE, CAN WE TALK ABOUT 
ANDREW GILLUM A LITTLE BIT MORE 
 
I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING IS 
AND ÃINTERESTING. 
AFTER LISTENING TO JIM DESCRIBE 
THOSE THREE THINGS THAT HE SAID 
THAT WERE FACTORS, BERNIE 
SANDERS, THE OPPOSITION BY 
ANDREW GILLUM TO STAND YOUR 
GROUND, AND THE FACT THAT AMONG 
THE NEGATIVE AS,  NONE OF THEM 
WERE TARGETED AT ANDREW GILLUM. 
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT -- 
WHAT IS THE PROPER APPROACH 
NATIONALLY?  
IS IT TO BE IN TUNE MORE WITH 
THOSE PROGRESSIVE KIND OF 
IDEALS? 
IS IT TO BE MORE MODERATE? 
IS THERE A TAKE AWAY THAT CAN 
BE APPLIED,  IF IN FACT ANDREW 
GILLUM IS ABLE TO EMERGE 
VICTORIOUS, ABOUT WHAT THE 
PROPER APPROACH FOR DEMOCRATS 
NATIONWIDE SHOULD BE? 
>>  I DON'T PUT LABELS ON 
DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE I THINK THAT 
YOU TAKE YELLOW DOG, BLUE DOG, 
PINK DOG. 
PROGRESSIVE NOT PROGRESSIVE, WE 
ARE JUST DEMOCRATS. 
I HATE LABELING PEOPLE 
UNDERNEATH THE TENT OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE. 
HOWEVER, YOU CANNOT 
UNDERESTIMATE THE FACT THAT THE 
TYPE OF CAMPAIGN THAT HE RAN 
WAS HIGH-TECH AND HIGH TOUCH 
CAMPAIGN. 
THAT WAS PART OF THE FAILURE I 
FEEL LIKE THAT HILLARY CLINTON 
DID NOT DO IN 2016. 
THE FACT THAT HE HAS ACTIVATED 
PEOPLE NORMALLY NOT INVOLVED IN 
THE PROCESS IS VERY TELLING 
ABOUT THE RESULTS AND THE SURGE 
IN TURNOUT, PARTICULARLY AMONG 
BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. 
I GUARANTEE YOU, WHEN WE 
CALCULATE THE TABS, WE WILL SEE 
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN HISTORIC 
GAINS AMONG BLACK AND BROWN 
VOTERS WITHIN FLORIDA. 
>> HOW DID HE ACTIVATE THEM? 
>> HIGH-TECH AND HIGH TOUCH. 
TRADITIONAL GRASSROOTS, 
KNOCKING ON DOORS, FAITH-BASED 
STUFF. 
YOU KNOW, ROBO CALLS, AFRICAN-
AMERICAN RADIO, ETC. 
BUT, THE HIGH-TECH COMPONENT, 
WHETHER IT IS DIGITAL, EMAILS, 
ON THE AIR, TB. 
TEXT MESSAGING, ALL OF THE 
NONTRADITIONAL THINGS THAT 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PROGRESSIVE 
CANDIDATES HAVE NOT DONE IN THE 
PAST. 
THE OTHER THING, WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP COMES SOME OF HIS 
FRIENDS, BUT ALL OF HIS 
ENEMIES. 
AND, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
THINGS THAT DRIVE OUT VOTERS IN 
ELECTIONS, FEAR, ANGER, AND 
FRUSTRATION. 
I THINK THOSE THINGS WILL BE A 
BIG FACTOR FOR THE U.S. SENATE 
RACE, AND THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
IN FLORIDA AND IN OTHER PLACES 
LIKE ARIZONA. 
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, LESLIE, 
AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST WHEN 
YOU HEAR THAT? 
>> CONSISTENTLY, I THINK THAT 
AS WE COME BACK INTO THE 
ASSESSMENT OF ALL THIS, THE 
CANDIDATES -- THESE 
CHARISMATIC, EVEN IN THE 
PRIMARIES WE SEE THE DYNAMIC 
HIGH TOUCH RETAIL POLITICIAN AND
FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT FLORIDA AND THE SEATS 
THAT WERE HELD AND THAT THEY 
SHOULD BE A SHOE IN. 
WE HAD A LOT OF CANDIDATES BACK 
OUT DID NOT THINK THEY COULD 
RAISE MONEY. 
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT SHE TOOK 
MORE OF A LAZY LAID-BACK 
APPROACH AS IT WAS AS COMPARED 
TO THE UNIVISION ANCHOR WENT 
OUT THERE AND REALLY HAS BEEN 
VERY PRESENT, DYNAMIC, AND IS 
REALLY GETTING A LOT OF 
ATTENTION. 
I THINK AS THE CARDS FALL, AND 
WE SEE THIS, IT IS GOING TO BE 
THESE INDIVIDUAL DYNAMIC, 
CANDIDATES THAT USE A 
COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND 
RETAIL POLITICKING, TO GET PAST 
THE NOISE, BUT WE CANNOT 
DISCOUNT THE PRESIDENTS EFFECT, 
THE TRUMP EFFECT OF GALVANIZING 
AND DRAWING THE ATTENTION AND 
THE MONEY TO GET THEM TO THAT 
NEXT LEVEL. 
>> YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING? 
>> THAT COULD BACKFIRE. 
>> IT WAS GOING TO BE MY 
QUESTION. 
IS THERE A ISSUE ABOUT 
ENERGIZING DEMOCRATS? 
>> THEY HAVE HAD TWO YEARS -- 
>> YOU THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER? 
>> EVERY DAY YOU THINK YOU 
CANNOT GET MORE EXCITED. 
EVEN AS REPUBLICANS WE ARE LIKE 
ÃTHIS IS NOT REALLY HAPPENING. 
EVERYDAY PEOPLE ARE EXCITED 
ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. 
THE QUESTION IS -- ARE THERE 
VIABLE CANDIDATES? 
THOSE WERE THE LESSONS FROM 
LAST YEAR. 
CONFIDENT, VIABLE CANDIDATES 
THAT CAN REALLY HOLD OFFICE AND 
LEAD? I THINK THAT YOU ARE 
STARTING TO SEE A GESTATION OF 
THAT BUT THERE ARE MORE ON THE 
RIGHT AND THE LEFT BUT IS 
FASCINATING IS THE PROGRESSIVE 
SIDE, THOSE CANDIDATES ARE ABLE 
TO REALLY KIND OF BECOME 
COMPETITIVE. 
BUT IN THESE RACES, THERE 
STATES THAT YOU NEVER WOULD 
HAVE SEEN A PROGRESSIVE 
CANDIDATE WIN. 
>> OR, CANDIDATES THAT ARE 
HOPPING IN THE CAR, WRITING 
DOWN THIS POLITICAL ROAD WITH 
DONALD TRUMP, I WOULD CAUTION 
THEM, BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW IN 
THE COMING DAYS, WEEKS, OR 
MONTHS WHAT THEY MAY LOOK LIKE 
FOR THIS PRESIDENT. 
KEEP IN MIND, HE HAS GOT SOME 
LEGAL ISSUES. 
HE HAS PEOPLE ALL AROUND HIM 
WHO HAVE RUBBED UP AGAINST HIM 
IN MANY WAYS THAT COULD BE 
GOING DOWN FROM A LEGAL 
STANDPOINT IN THE COMING DAYS 
OR WEEKS, THAT COULD HAVE 
TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HIS 
APPROVAL, THAT COULD HAVE 
TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HOW THE 
PUBLIC VIEWS HIM. 
THAT COULD HAVE TREMENDOUS 
IMPACT ON HOW HE IS ABLE TO 
GARNER SUPPORT AMONG THE BASE 
AND BRING BACK OUT THE VOTERS 
WHO VOTED FOR HIM IN THE 2016 
ELECTION AS WELL AS CONVINCE 
PEOPLE TO NOT VOTE AGAINST HIM 
IN THE MIDTERMS.
>> CAITLIN, HAVEN'T WE SEEN 
THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT 
REMAIN ROCKSOLID AMONG THAT 40% 
OF VOTERS? 
FOR OTHER PEOPLE, WHO ARE 
LOOKING AT THE RUSSIA 
SITUATION, AND A LOT OF FOLKS 
DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT 
YET, THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTUAL 
CONCLUSION BY ROBERT MUELLER. 
>> THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SEEN THE 
PRESIDENT CREATE HIS OWN MESSAGE
AROUND THIS MUELLER PROBE, 
TRYING TO WIN THE PUBLIC 
RELATIONS BATTLE AND INFLUENCE 
PUBLIC OPINION. 
THAT IS BEFORE ANYTHING 
ACTUALLY COMES OUT OF IT IN 
TERMS OF THE RELATION TO HIM. 
I THINK WHAT IS REALLY 
INTERESTING HERE IS THAT YOU 
KNOW, THE MAP IS NOT THE SAME 
EVERYWHERE. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPETITIVE 
HOUSE RACES FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT 
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPETITIVE 
SENATE RACES FOR REPUBLICANS. 
NOW, THE HOUSES WHERE THE 
CONCERNS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT LIE 
OF COURSE. 
SO, THAT IS REALLY THE BIG KIND 
OF KEY ISSUE HERE AND ALONG 
WITH THAT TURNOVER COMES ALL 
THE TURNOVER OF CHAIRMANÃ
CHAIRMANSHIPS AND THE INNER 
WORKINGS OF CONGRESS AND WE 
HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE. 
ON THE SENATE SIDE, REPUBLICANS 
ARE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT THEIR 
PROSPECTS LOOK LIKE, TAKING 
OVER SOME OF THESE SENATE 
RACES, ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT JUDGES. 
THE SENATE CONFIRMING JUDGES AT 
A NEAR RECORD PACE. 
A NEAR RECORD AMOUNT OF FEDERAL 
JUDGESHIPS STILL OPEN. 
SO, THESE ARE SOME OF THE KINDS 
OF THINGS. 
YOU KNOW, YOU WILL SEE 
REPUBLICANS ON THE HOUSE SIDE 
TRY TO LOCALIZE THEIR RACES, ON 
THE SENATE SIDE THERE VERY MUCH 
TRYING TO NATIONALIZE THESE 
RACES AND HITCH THEMSELVES TO 
DONALD TRUMP AND SOME OF THE 
STATES. 
>> WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED, 
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AS 
WE FOLLOW A TIGHT RACE IN 
FLORIDA'S DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY 
FOR GOVERNOR. 
THIS IS A LIVE LOOK AT ANDREW 
GILLUM'S WATCH PARTY IN 
TALLAHASSEE, WHERE EXCITEMENT 
IS BUILDING.  
HER PRIMARY COVERAGE AFTER A 
QUICK BREAK. 
YOUR STREAMING CBSN. 
♪
>>> WELCOME BACK TO CBSN'S  
CAMPAIGN COVERAGE. 
WE ARE WATCHING THIS LIVE 
PICTURE OUT OF TALLAHASSEE, 
FLORIDA. 
YOU CAN SEE THE CANDIDATES IN 
THE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDAE 
READY TO TAKE THE PODIUM. 
ANDREW GILLUM WAS IN A TIGHT úR.
YOU SEE THE NUMBERS. 
WE SHOULD NOTE THAT OTHER 
OUTLETS ARE CALLING THIS RACE, 
ARE WE NOW CALLING IT ALSO AS 
WELL? 
OKAY, IT IS A PROJECTION WITH 
ANDREW GILLUM EMERGING THE 
VICTOR IN THE FLORIDA  
GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY. 
BACK TO THAT LIFE SHOT IN 
TALLAHASSEE, WHERE WE SPEAK TO 
OUR PANEL HERE. 
ANTOINE, LET ME START WITH YOU. 
WE HAD SPOKEN LAST SEGMENT 
ABOUT THE NOTION THAT THERE 
WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT PUSHED 
ANDREW GILLUM  TOWARDS THE 
FRONT THAT PEOPLE MAYBE DID NOT 
EVEN SEE COMING. 
BUT, IN YOUR VIEW, YOU THINK IT 
WAS HIS COMBINATION OF OLD-
FASHIONED SHOE LEATHER, RETAIL 
POLITICS, WITH A HIGH-TECH 
APPROACH THAT HAS NOT 
NECESSARILY BEEN TAKEN BEFORE 
BY A CANDIDATE LIKE HIM? 
>> IT WAS A REMIX VERSION. 
LET ME SAY TO ENTER, I'M TRYING 
NOT TO BE EMOTIONAL, BUT IT IS A
HISTORIC NIGHT. 
THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY 
OF FLORIDA THAT A AFRICAN-
AMERICAN WILL BE THE DEMOCRATIC 
NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR. 
SO, NOW FOR DEMOCRATS WE HAVE 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT THE 
FIRST FEMALE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY AND NOW 
THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA. 
THAT JUST SHOWS YOU HOW FAR WE 
HAVE COME AS A COUNTRY, AND HOW 
FAR WE HAVE COME AS A 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
THE SECOND THING IS -- I DON'T 
CARE WHAT ALL THE OTHER FACTORS 
ARE. 
BERNIE SANDERS, PROGRESSIVE 
LABELS, ETC. 
-- YOU CANNOT DISCOUNT THE FACT 
THAT HE RAN A CAMPAIGN LIKE NO 
OTHER. 
HE CAMPAIGNED LIKE NO OTHER, 
AND PEOPLE SHOWED UP IN WAYS 
THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEFORE FOR 
HIM. 
YOU JUST CANNOT DISCREDIT THAT. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PLACES WHERE 
HILLARY CLINTON LOST IN 16, 
WHERE DEMOCRATS UNDERPERFORMED, 
THOSE VOTER NUMBERS ARE UP. 
THEY REGISTERED A TON OF NEW 
VOTERS, THERE IS A BIG FOCUS ON 
VOTER REGISTRATION. 
AND ALL THAT MAKES A 
DIFFERENCE. 
BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES. 
THOSE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. 
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW IT 
IMPACTS THEIR WALLET. 
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW IT IS 
GOING TO IMPACT THEIR QUALITY 
OF LIFE. 
HE SPENT HIS TIME TALKING ABOUT 
THOSE ISSUES WHILE EVERYONE 
ELSE WAS TRYING TO RUN A 
GENERAL ELECTION THING. 
HE FOCUSED ON DOING STEP ONE 
AND I THINK THAT MADE ALL THE 
DIFFERENCE. 
>> DID HE TALK ABOUT 
IMPEACHMENT? 
>> HE DID NOT. 
HE STAYED FOCUS ON THE THINGS 
THAT MATTER. 
LOSERS DO NOT LEGISLATE. 
IF YOU CANNOT GET TO STEP ONE 
YOU CANNOT GET TO STEP TWO TO 
TALK ABOUT DOING ALL THE THINGS 
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO ONCE YOU 
BECOME AT THE TOP FROM THE 
WINNERS CIRCLE. 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> WELL, HE IS A 39-YEAR-OLD 
MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE, BORN IN 
MIAMI. 
HIS CAMPAIGN BIO REMINDS FOLKS 
THAT HIS MOTHER WAS A SCHOOL 
BUS DRIVER AND HIS FATHER WAS A 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER. 
HE WAS AND IS THE LIBERAL IN 
THIS RACE, MAKE NO MISTAKE. 
AND I CHECKED WITH ONE 
PROGRESSIVE ACTIVIST WHO HAS 
BEEN ON THE GROUND IN FLORIDA 
WITH THE ANDREW GILLUM CAMPAIGN 
FOR A FEW DAYS.  
THIS PERSON SAID THAT HE OVER 
PERFORMED IN BROWARD COUNTY, 
HILLSBORO COUNTY RELATIVE TO 
THE EARLY VOTE. 
AND GOT A BIG SURGE OF SUPPORT 
IN HILLSBORO COUNTY, WHICH IS 
THE ONE THAT ENCOMPASSES TAMPA. 
HE IS SPEAKING NOW. 
>> -- KEEP FLORIDA BLUE. 
 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
HOW ARE Y'ALL DOING? I 
GOT TO TELL YOU ALL, I AM 
OVERWHELMED. 
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE JUST A FEW 
PEOPLE, JUST A FEW PEOPLE WHO 
SAID THAT THIS MOMENT WOULD NOT 
BE POSSIBLE. 
 -- A FEW. 
AND THEN, THERE WERE -- AND 
THEN THERE WERE A FEW MORE WHO 
BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE.
 
>> I REALIZE, I REALIZE THAT 
FOR SOME, THEY ARE JUST TUNING 
INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT 
THIS MEANS FOR ALL OF US, 
RIGHT? 
SOME. 
THERE ARE SOME, AND I WANT YOU 
TO KNOW AS I HAVE SAID AND 
MOVED ACROSS THE STATE, THAT 
THIS THING IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT 
NEVER HAS BEEN, AND IT NEVER 
WILL BE, THIS RACE IS ABOUT 
EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE OF US, 
RIGHT? 
THOSE OF US IN THIS ROOM, THOSE 
OF US OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM, 
THOSE OF US WHO VOTED FOR ME, 
THOSE WHO DID NOT VOTE AT ALL, 
THOSE WHO COULD NOT VOTE FOR ME 
BECAUSE THEY MAY BE REPUBLICANS.
BUT, YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING?
I WANT TO BE THERE GOVERNOR TWO.
ALL RIGHT? 
I WANT TO BE THERE GOVERNOR TWO.
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE OUR STORY -- 
AS YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY OVER 
THE COURSE OF THIS RACE, OUR 
STORY FOR ME BEGAN DOWN AND 
RICHMOND HEIGHTS. 
AND MIAMI-DADE COUNTY. 
TO MY MOTHER, FRANCIS, WHO IS 
HERE WITH ME WHO WAS A SCHOOL 
BUS DRIVER, AND MY DADDY, 
CHARLES. 
AND MY DADDY, CHARLES GROWING 
UP, WHO WAS A CONSTRUCTION 
WORKER. 
IN FACT, WHEN MY FATHER DID NOT 
HAVE CONSTRUCTION WORK TO DO, 
YOU WOULD FIND HIM ON A STREET 
CORNER SELLING FRUITS OR 
VEGETABLES. 
ON SATURDAY MORNING, HE WOULD 
SET UP HIS FRUIT STAND AND HIS 
FLOWER STAND ACROSS THE STREET 
FROM THE CEMETERY AND SELL 
FLOWERS TO BEREAVED FAMILIES. 
BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND FATHER, 
THEIR THE BEST EXAMPLES OF HARD 
WORK THAT I KNOW TO THIS DAY. 
 
>> THEY ARE THE ONES, THEY ARE 
THE ONES WHO HAVE TAUGHT ME WHAT
PERSISTENCE IS. 
BEFORE I COULD DEFINE THE TERMS 
OF THE WORD, I KNEW WHAT IT 
MEANT NOT TO QUIT. 
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO PERSEVERE.
I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT TO SILENCE 
AND QUIET THE HATERS. 
ALL RIGHT? 
THE NAYSAYERS. 
>> WE LOVE YOU, ANDREW. 
>> I LOVE YOU BACK. 
 
>> BUT, BECAUSE OF THEIR EXAMPLE
IT INSTILLED IN ME A QUALITY OF 
HARD WORK THAT I NEVER FORGET. 
AS THE FIFTH OF SEVEN KIDS AND 
THE FIRST TO GRADUATE FROM 
COLLEGE, YOU CANNOT TELL 
ANYBODY IN OUR FAMILY WE DO NOT 
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO SEE 
INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY. 
WE CAN SEE IT INTERRUPTED AT 
THE HANDS OF A EDUCATION. 
IT IS THOSE VERY SAME -- MY 
HIGH SCHOOL, IT IS THOSE VERY 
SAME PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO 
POURED INTO ME, WHO TOLD ME 
THAT I COULD WHEN I THOUGHT 
THAT I COULDN'T. 
WHO TOLD ME THAT I COULD GO 
FURTHER, EVEN WHEN I THOUGHT I 
HAD REACHED MY LIMITS. 
IT WAS THOSE TEACHERS WHO MADE 
IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GO TO 
COLLEGE AT THE FLORIDA 
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL 
UNIVERSITY. 
I CAN'T --  
>> I CANNOT THANK, I CAN'T THANK
ENOUGH MY FLORIDA A AND M 
UNIVERSITY FAMILY THAT HAVE 
HELD ME UP THROUGHOUT THIS RACE.
BUT, I ALSO CANNOT HESITATE TO 
THINK THOSE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT 
KNOW ME FROM ADAM WHO, AS I 
TRAVELED AROUND THE STATE, THEY 
TOOK HOLD OF OUR VISION AND OUR 
MISSION, AND OUR PLANS FOR A 
STATE THAT MAKES ROOM FOR ALL 
OF US. 
NOT JUST THE WELL-CONNECTED, 
BUT ALL OF US. 
AND I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT 
WHAT IS GOING TO DELIVER US TO 
VICTORY IN NOVEMBER IS THE FACT 
THAT THERE ARE EVERYDAY HARD-
WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS STATE 
WHO BELIEVE, WHO BELIEVE -- 
THAT THEY DESERVE A VOICE IN 
OUR GOVERNMENT TO, AND WE ARE 
GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM. 
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM.
THE POINT HAS NEVER BEEN LOST 
ON ME THAT MY NAME ON THE 
BALLOT IS SIMPLY A VESSEL. 
IT IS SIMPLY THE NAME, BUT WHAT 
IS UNDERNEATH THAT NAME ALL THE 
ISSUES THAT WE CARE SO DEEPLY 
ABOUT. 
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME IS THE 
BELIEF THAT WE OUGHT TO PAY 
TEACHERS WHAT THEY ARE WORTH 
FOR DOING THE MOST DIFFICULT 
JOB THAT EXISTS ON EARTH. 
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME IS OUR 
BELIEF THAT OUR PUBLIC 
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR PUBLIC 
TAX DOLLARS ARE TO BE USED FOR 
THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM, TO 
EDUCATE ALL KIDS. 
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME -- WHAT 
IS BEHIND AND BENEATH MY NAME 
IS A BELIEF, A VERY DEEP AND 
PASSIONATE BELIEF THAT ANYBODY 
WHO WORKS A FULL-TIME JOB, WHO 
GETS UP EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK 
WHO SPENDS 40 HOURS FULL-TIME 
GIVING THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIFE
TO THEIR PROFESSION INTO THEIR 
WORK, IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THEY 
 
CAN LIVE ON AND NOT BE PAID 
POVERTY WAGES AS THEY SERVICE 
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. 
WHAT I ALSO BELIEVE IS THAT 
FOLKS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO WORK 
ONE JOB, NOT 2-3, BUT ONE FULL-
TIME JOB AS A WAY TO MAKE ENDS 
MEET. 
WHAT IS B■ENEATH MY NAME? 
THE BELIEF THAT WE DESERVE A 
GOVERNOR WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES 
IN THE SCIENCE. 
 ACTUALLY BELIEVES  
WHO IS GOING TO TAKE BACK 
CONTROL OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND 
MAKE IT MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN. 
WERE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR TO 
BREATHE, CLEAN WATER TO DRINK, 
OUR OCEANS -- THAT ARE NOT 
CONTAMINATED WITH RED TIDE AND 
BLUE-GREEN ALGAE SUFFOCATING 
OUR SEA LIFE. 
THERE IS NOT A PROFIT MARGIN IN 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA THAT OUGHT 
TO BE ABLE TO ROB US OF THOSE 
ELEMENTS OF CLEAN WATER, CLEAN 
AIR, AND GOOD OCEANS. 
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME -- A 
BELIEF THAT WE HAVE TO TREAT 
HEALTHCARE LIKE A RIGHT, AND 
NOT A PRIVILEGE. 
I BELIEVE THAT. 
AND IT BEGINS BY EXPANDING 
MEDICAID FOR OVER 700,000 OF 
THE MOST MEDICALLY NEEDY PEOPLE 
IN THIS STATE. 
YOU CAN ALSO REST ASSURED THAT 
WHEN I AM GOVERNOR OF THE STATE 
OF FLORIDA, IF THE PRESIDENT 
DECIDES TO SEND US $2.4 BILLION 
TO BUILD A HIGH-SPEED RAIL 
ACROSS THE QUARTER, WE ARE 
GOING TO BRING THAT MONEY RIGHT 
HERE TO THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
RIGHT? 
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT THESE 
ARE NOT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT 
ISSUES -- THE JOB OF THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA IS TO DO WHAT IS IN THE 
BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING THAT 
GUY FOR YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT
BENEATH MY NAME IS ALSO A 
DESIRE BY THE MAJORITY OF 
PEOPLE IN THIS STATE TO SEE 
REAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM 
TAKE HOLD IN THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA. 
THE KIND OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
REFORM THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO 
MAKE A MISTAKE TO BE ABLE TO 
REDEEM THEMSELVES FROM THAT 
MISTAKE, RETURN TO SOCIETY, 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE, BUT 
ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO WORK. 
A GOOD WAGE. 
THIS IS -- NOT MY MOMENT, THIS 
IS OUR MOMENT. 
THIS IS OUR MOMENT. 
WE COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY WERE 
IT NOT FOR THE STRUGGLE, THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS, THE HARD WORK, 
THE ORGANIZING, THE SELF 
ORGANIZING WHEN WE WENT INTO 
PLACES AND WE DID NOT HAVE 
FLYERS TO HAND OUT THAT I WENT 
BACK A WEEK LATER AND THEY HAD 
MADE THEIR OWN FLYERS. 
RIGHT? 
THE PLACES -- THE PLACES WHERE 
WE HAD NO VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION
BUT PEOPLE BEGAN TO SELF 
ORGANIZE AND VOLUNTEER. 
WE ARE IN THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF 
THE EVERYDAY PEOPLE OF THIS 
STATE. 
AND I CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER 
WITHOUT AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGING 
THAT I AM HERE BECAUSE I AM 
PROPPED UP ON MY LEFT AND MY 
RIGHT SIDE. 
THERE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS.
THE WOMAN -- THE WOMAN WHO 
MAKES ME SMILE JUST A LITTLE 
BIT WIDER. 
THE WOMAN WHO, IN MY ABSENCE 
HAS BEEN AN AMAZING MOTHER AND 
AN AMAZING PARTNER AND SHE IS 
GOING TO BE AN AMAZING FIRST 
LADY FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
MY WIFE -- I LOVE YOU HONEY. 
I LOVE YOU BABY. 
WE -- WE TOGETHER, WE TOGETHER, 
WITH ALL OF YOU, OVER THE NEXT 
SEVERAL MONTHS ARE GOING TO 
MAKE OUR WAY ALL ACROSS THE 
STATE OF FLORIDA TO READ 
COUNTIES, TWO BLUE COUNTIES, 
TUBER -- PURPLE COUNTIES, AND 
WE ARE GOING TO UNITE THIS 
STATE IN WAYS THAT ARE 
UNPARALLELED IN THE HISTORY OF 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
WE ARE GOING TO BRING PEOPLE 
TOGETHER, NOT THROUGH 
SUPERFICIAL DIFFERENCES, RACE, 
COLOR, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WHO 
WE CHOOSE TO LOVE, RIGHT? 
THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO BE OUR 
DIVIDING LINES. 
WHAT IS GOING TO BRING US 
TOGETHER IS OUR COMMON AND 
SHARED BELIEF THAT REGARDLESS 
OF WHERE YOU COME FROM, 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR MOTHER 
OR FATHER DID FOR A PROFESSION. 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIDE OF THE 
TRACKS YOU LIVE ON, THAT EVERY 
SINGLE FLORIDIAN OUGHT TO HAVE 
AN EQUAL AND FAIR SHOT AT THE 
AMERICAN DREAM. 
 BUT, WHAT WE ARE 
ALSO GOING TO DO OVER THE NEXT 
-- THESE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE CLEAR TO 
THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT THE 
DARK DAYS THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
UNDER COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON 
-- THAT THE DURATION AND 
DIVISION THAT IS BECOMING -- 
BEEN COMING OUT OF THE WHITE 
HOUSE, THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE 
STATE OF FLORIDA, WE ARE GOING 
TO REMIND THIS NATION OF WHAT 
IS TRULY THE AMERICAN WAY. 
WHAT IS TRULY THE AMERICAN WAY. 
YOU CAN SIMPLY START AT THE 
BOTTOM, RICHMOND HEIGHTS, SOUTH 
DADE COUNTY, AND MAKE YOUR WAY 
TO THE TOP. 
AND BE OF SERVICE TO ALL PEOPLE,
HAVE A MESSAGE OF LOVE, OF 
UNITY, OF CONNECTION, OF COMMON 
SENSE, OF DECENCY, OF WHAT IS 
RIGHT, AND NOT WHAT IS WRONG. 
AND THAT MESSAGE IS BIG ENOUGH 
AND DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL OF 
US. 
RIGHT? 
IT IS. 
AND SO, IN THE WORDS OF MY 
GRANDMOTHER WHO GROWING UP USED 
TO REGULARLY ANOINT MY HEAD 
WITH OIL, SHE WOULD SAY A 
BLESSING OVER US, A MANTRA IF 
YOU WILL. 
SHE WOULD SAY WAY, GO TO SCHOOL.
MY AND YOUR TEACHERS, GET YOUR 
LESSON AND ONE DAY BRING THAT 
EDUCATION HOME. 
 
>> SHE WOULD SAY, SHE WOULD SAY 
BRING IT HOME FOR YOUR LITTLE 
BROTHER AND LITTLE SISTER, THEY 
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET. 
BRING IT HOME FOR THE BOY DOWN 
THE STREET, GOD KNOWS WHERE HE 
WILL END UP. 
BRING IT HOME FOR YOUR MOTHER 
AND YOUR DADDY WHO GO UP THERE 
ÃAND WORK ON SOME ELSE'S JOB, 
TO KEEP A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD. 
AND, CLOTHES ON YOUR BACK, AND 
FOOD ON THE TABLE, BRING IT 
HOME. 
AND AS I HAVE SAID TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN, I DID NOT ALWAYS 
KNOW WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER WAS 
COMMUNICATING TO ME. 
BUT I WOULD COME TO LEARN THAT 
WHAT SHE WAS SAYING WAS MAYBE 
IT AIN'T JUST ABOUT YOU. 
IT IS NOT EVEN JUST ABOUT YOUR 
BROTHER AND YOUR SISTER, IT IS 
NOT JUST ABOUT YOUR FRIEND DOWN 
THE STREET, IT IS ABOUT ALL OF 
US. 
THERE WAS A BELIEF THAT IF I 
WENT FAR IN LIFE, WE WOULD ALL 
GO FAR IN LIFE. 
THAT IF I DID GOOD, WE WOULD 
ALL DO GOOD. 
WELL, FLORIDA YOU KNOW WHAT? 
WE HAVE TO BRING THAT SENSE OF 
COMMUNITY AND COLLECTION AND 
COLLECTIVISM BACK TO THE STATE 
OF FLORIDA. 
THAT THE WAY THAT THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA DOES GOOD, THE WAY THAT 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA -- TO BE A 
LEADER AGAIN, IT IS NOT FOR US 
TO PRAY FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S 
DEFEAT OR DEMISE, BUT FOR US TO 
FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN 
CREATE A VOTE THAT ALL OF US  
CAN RIDE IN, BECAUSE I BELIEVE 
THAT A RISING TIDE DOES LIFT 
ALL BOATS. 
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING? 
RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA TONIGHT, WE HAVE SHOWN 
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THAT WE 
CAN BE THE DAVID IN THE 
SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A 
GOLIATH. 
THAT YOU CAN BE THE NON-
MILLIONAIRE, YOU CAN COME FROM 
WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES, AND YOU 
CAN MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP. 
WELL Y'ALL, LET ME BE VERY 
CLEAR, AND BE VERY CLEAR -- WE 
HAVE GOT A FEW MONTHS TO GO, 
AND WE HAVE GOT TO REDOUBLE OUR 
EFFORTS AS WE GO FORWARD. 
WE HAVE GOT TO GET OUT THERE 
AND ORGANIZE LIKE WE HAVE A -- 
NEVER ORGANIZED BEFORE. 
WE HAVE GOT TO GET OUT THERE 
AND BRING ALL THE PEOPLE THAT 
WE CAN TO OUR SIDE. 
WE HAVE GOT TO DO THAT, Y'ALL. 
NOT BY BEING HATEFUL OR BEING 
DIVISIVE, BUT BY REMINDING 
FLORIDA OF WHO WE ARE. AND BY 
REMINDING THE COUNTRY THAT YOU 
KNOW WHAT? 
THE AMERICAN WAY LIVES AND IF 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA HAS TO 
SHOW THE REST OF THE WORLD, 
THEN LET IT BEGIN RIGHT HERE, 
TONIGHT. 3
THAT WILL START RIGHT HERE IN 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
AS I CONCLUDE, I WANT TO GIVE A 
PERSONAL WORD OF APPRECIATION 
TO ALL FOUR OF MY OPPONENTS, 
THEY WERE WORTHY OPPONENTS. 
THEY ALL HAD THEIR OWN VISIONS 
FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. 
AND NOW IT IS TIME FOR ALL FIVE 
OF US TO COME TOGETHER AND TO 
WORK TOGETHER TO WORK TOGETHER 
TO MOVE OUR STATE FORWARD. 
I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN WITH 
CHRIS KING AND GWEN GRAHAM THIS 
EVENING, WHO BOTH  OFFERED 
THEIR WORDS OF RESPECT AND ALSO 
THEIR WORDS OF SUPPORT. 
AND, SO NOW -- WE HAVE GOT TO 
DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN, 
BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE WAY HOME, 
BUT WE AREN'T ALL THE WAY HOME 
YET. 
ALL RIGHT? 
SO, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS 
COMMIT OURSELVES TO BRINGING IT 
HOME, NOT FOR ME, NOT FOR THOSE 
OF US IN THIS ROOM, BUT FOR THE 
NAMES THAT WE CAN'T RECOGNIZE, 
WE ARE GOING TO BRING THIS 
THING HOME. 
TONIGHT, AS THE MAYOR OF 
FLORIDA'S CAPITAL CITY, -- AS 
THE MAYOR OF FLORIDA'S CAPITAL 
CITY, I HUMBLY ACCEPT THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. 
 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING 
THERE TO TALLAHASSEE MAYOR, 
ANDREW GILLUM, WHO WON THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR 
GOVERNOR. 
YOU HEARD HIM ADDRESSING HIS 
SUPPORTERS  IN HIS VICTORY 
SPEECH IN TALLAHASSEE. 
AS HE WAS SPEAKING, WE SAW A 
TWEET FROM SENATOR BERNIE 
SANDERS, PART OF ANDREW 
GILLUM'S CAMPAIGN  AND IT 
úINCL 
HIM. 
LET'S LISTEN -- IS HE SPEAKING 
AGAIN? 
>> MY LOVING WIFE, MY THREE 
KIDS, MY MOTHER, MY MOTHER-IN-
LAW, MY BROTHERS AND MY SISTER, 
ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU, AND ON 
BEHALF OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF  
THIS NOMINATION AND LOOK FORWARD
TO NOVEMBER 6, WHEN I AM ELECTED
THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT 
STATE OF FLORIDA. 
GOD BLESS YOU, LET'S BRING IT 
HOME. 
>> OKAY, AND NOW WE BELIEVE 
THAT HE HAS CONCLUDED HIS 
VICTORY SPEECH. 
BUT, ANDREW GILLUM IN HIS QUEST 
TO BECOME GOVERNOR, IF ELECTED 
HE WOULD BE FLORIDA'S FIRST 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN GOVERNOR. 
YOU HEARD HIM THERE TALK ABOUT 
HIS SUPPORTERS. 
THERE IS THE TWEET FROM SENATOR 
SANDERS THAT I MENTIONED. 
HE SAID CONGRATULATIONS TO 
ANDREW GILLUM ON HIS VICTORY.  
TONIGHT, FLORIDIANS JOINED HIM 
IN STANDING UP AND DEMANDING 
REAL CHANGE . LET'S MAKE 
HISTORY THIS NOVEMBER, AND MAKE 
ANDREW GILLUM THE GOVERNOR OF 
FLORIDA.  
ED O'KEEFE, LET ME START WITH 
YOU, FIRST OF ALL -- YOU KNOW, 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN 
LOOKING FOR THE DIRECTION THAT 
WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY 
TO TRY AND DEFEAT REPUBLICANS, 
AND YOU HAVE SEENÃ
PROGRESSIVES AND MODERATES TAKE 
VARYING APPROACHES HERE. 
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT NOW THAT 
YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE A ANDREW 
GILLUM, WHO HAS PULLED OFF  
WHAT IN MANY RESPECTS IS AN 
UPSET WHEN IN THAT PARTICULAR 
RACE? 
WITH BERNIE SANDERS 
ENDORSEMENT? 
>> THIS IS A FAR BIGGER PRIZE 
FOR THE PROGRESSIVE OR LIBERAL 
WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
THEN THE QUEENS CONGRESSIONAL 
SEAT THAT HAS BEEN ONE BY 
ALEXANDRIA ACOSTA CORTEZ. 
MAKE NO MISTAKE, WINNING A 
PRIMARY IN A SWING STATE IN 
THIS COUNTRY,  IT IS A BIG 
DEAL. 
AND ANDREW GILLUM, THE 39-YEAR-
OLD MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE DID IT 
WITH THE SUPPORT OF BERNIE 
SANDERS AND TOM STIERS  NEXT 
GEN ORGANIZATION. 
WITH THE NATIONAL ENDORSEMENT 
FROM INDIVISIBLE, THE GROUP 
THAT WAS FORMED, GRASSROOTS -- 
NETWORKS SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS ELECTED. 
THEY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY IN 
THE CLOSING DAYS  AND THEY WERE 
ABLE TO PULL IT OFF TONIGHT. 
THAT WAS IN AN IMPRESSIVE WAY 
AND THEY DID IT IN BROWARD 
COUNTY IN THE SOUTH, 
HLLSBOROUGH COUNTY, IN TAMPA 
AND UP IN THE NORTH, WHERE HE 
ENJOYS HIS BASE OF SUPPORT, AND 
IT IS A CONSIDERABLE VICTORY. 
AGAIN, I THINK FOR MORE 
SINIFICANT THAN THE MOVEMENT 
THAT ALEXANDRIA ACOSTA CORTEZ 
STARTED HERE IN NEW YORK. 
IF YOU CAN DO IT IN A STATE 
LIKE FLORIDA,  I SUSPECT WE ARE 
GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF LIBERALS 
AND PROGRESSIVES SAY YOU CAN DO 
IT ANYWHERE. 
>> ANTOINE, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE 
ON THIS VICTORY? 
>> I THINK THAT IT TAKES MANY 
PARTS TO MAKE A CAR RUN. 
YOU NEED THE ENGINE, 
TRANSMISSION, LIGHTS, TIRES, 
ALL THE THINGS. 
SO, I THINK BERNIE SANDERS AND 
ALL THE GROUPS THAT MENTIONED 
ARE PARTS OF THE CAR THAT MAKE 
THIS CAR RUN DOWN THE ROAD AS 
THE WAY IT DID TONIGHT. 
BUT, WHAT I THINK HAPPENED 
TONIGHT WAS THAT I THINK 
ANDREW'S CAMPAIGN SET A TONE OR 
A MODEL FOR WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE 
GOING TO NEED TO DO TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL IN NOVEMBE. 
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS -- 
WE HAVE TRIED TO RUN IN THE 
SOUTH WITH THE CAMPAIGNS. 
WE HAVE TRIED TO HAVE MODERATE 
CANDIDATES AND RUN AWAY FROM 
THE BASE. 
BUT, ANDREW, AND STACEY ABRAMS 
SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU TAKE CARE 
OF HOME FIRST, EVERYTHING ELSE  
BECOMES EASY. 
IF WE CONTINUE THIS STRATEGY OF 
TAKING CARE OF THE BASE, MAKING 
SURE THAT THE BASE TURNS OUT AS 
DOUG JONES DID WITH 98% OF 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN WHO 
SHOWED SUPPORT FOR HIM, AS 
STACEY ABRAMS AND ANDREW DID 
TONIGHT,  THEN WE WILL BE WELL-
POSITIONED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. 
>> GO AHEAD, CAITLIN. 
>> WAS GOING TO SAY ESPECIALLY 
SINCE HE IS RUNNING AGAINST RON 
DESANTIS. 
THIS WILL BE A TEST OF BASE 
ELECTORAL POLITICS  IN A STATE 
LIKE FLORIDA. 
>> WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO TALK 
ABOUT, BUT RIGHT NOW WE WILL 
TAKE A QUICK BREAK, MUCH MORE 
PRIMARY COVERAGE IS AHEAD, AS 
POLLS GET SET TO CLOSE IN 
ARIZONA, YOUR STREAMING CBSN. 
STAY WITH US. 
. 
>>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, 
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE'S RUNNING 
AGAINST RON DESANTIS. 
THIS IS POLITICS IN A STATE 
LIKE FLORIDA. 
>> WE HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK 
ABOUT. 
BUT RIGHT NOW, A QUICK BREAK. 
MUCH MORE AHEAD. 
AS POLLS GET TOTE SETTO CLOSE 
IN ARIZONA. 
REMEMBER THAT? 
YOU'RE STREAMING. 
STAY WITH US. 
. 
>>> HELLO. 
I'M BILL WHITAKER WITH "60 
MINUTES." 
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 
CONGRESSMAN MORENO. 
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS 
OUT OF CONTROL. 
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 
PEOPLE DIE. 
>> WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN 
ABOUT THIS WITHOUT "60 
MINUTES." 
>> I DID SEE THE REPORT. 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE 
REPORT AND TAKE IT VERY 
SERIOUSLY. 
>> THEY WERE JUST DRUG DEALERS 
IN LAB COATS. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 
PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 
>>> HI, EVERYONE. 
I'M ELAINE QUIJANO. 
WELCOME TO CBSN'S SPECIAL 
ELECTION COVERAGE OF THE 
FLORIDA AND ARIZONA PRIMARIES 
THIS. 
IS THE LAST BIG PRIMARY DAY, 
BEFORE THE CRITICAL NOVEMBER 
ELECTIONS. 
TONIGHT'S RESULTS WILL DECIDE 
MIDTERM MATCHUPS FOR GOVERNOR, 
SENATE AND THE HOUSE. 
IN ARIZONA, POLLS HAVE NOW JUST 
CLOSED. 
THE STATE'S REPUBLICAN SENATE 
RACE HAS RECEIVED ENORMOUS 
ATTENTION. 
IT FEATURES THREE CANDIDATES  
WHO HAVE VIED FOR THE 
PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT, BUT 
HAVE NOT RECEIVE TODAY. 
THEY ARE RUNNING TO REPLACE GOP 
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE, WHO IS 
RETIRING. 
THE RACES IN ARIZONA ARE 
HAPPENING IN THE SHADOW OF 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S PASSING. 
THE LONG-TIME ARIZONA 
REPUBLICAN SEAT IS NOT UP FOR 
GRABS TONIGHT. 
BUT HIS DEATH HAS PUT A 
SPOTLIGHT ON THE FUTURE OF THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
>>> AND IN FLORIDA, WE ARE 
SEEING THE FIRST UPSET OF THE 
NIGHT, WHERE ANDREW GILLUM HAS 
WON THE DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR 
GOVERNOR. 
HE WAS BACKED GUY BY SENATOR 
BERNIE SANDERS AND NOW AIMS TO 
BE THE FIRST BLACK GOVERNOR IN 
FLORIDA HISTORY. 
GILLUM WILL NOW FACE DESANTIS, 
WHO DEFEATED PUTNAM IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RACE. 
THIS HAS BEEN TOUTED AS A PRESS 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT. 
EARLIER, HE CONGRATULATED HIM 
ON TWITTER, CALLING IT A 
FANTASTIC WIN. 
MEANWHILE NTHE SENATE RACE, 
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT, 
WON HIS PRIMARY. 
WHICH MEANS HE'LL FACE OFF 
AGAINST DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT 
BILL NELSON. 
WE HAVE A PANEL TO COVER EVERY 
ASPECT OF TONIGHT'S RACES. 
ED O'KEEFE. 
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS A 
TRIBUTER AND REPORTER FOR 
POLITICS. 
AND FOUNDER AND CEO OF 
BLUEPRINT STRATEGY. 
AND RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, LET'S 
TURN TO JOSEPH GARCIA. 
HE IS WITH ARIZONA STATE 
UNIVERSITY'S MORRISON INSTITUTE 
FOR PUBLIC POLICY. 
HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF 
COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY 
IMPACT AS WELL AS DIRECTOR OF 
THE LATINO PUBLIC POLICY 
CENTER. 
JOSEPH, THANK YOU FOR JOINING 
US. 
YOU RECENTLY SAID BY 2030, 
ARIZONA WOULD BE A MINORITY 
STATE. 
>> WITH MORE LATINOS GOING 
THROUGH THE MATURATION PROCESS, 
MORE LATINOS WILL BE ABLE TO 
VOTE. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT LATINOS IN ARIZONA ARE A 
VERY YOUNG POPULATION. 
BUT ALL OF THEM ARE U.S. 
CITIZENS. 
SO THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO 
VOTE, ONCE THEY TURN 18. 
BUT MANY LATINOS HAVE YET TO 
TURN 18. 
SO THE SUNANLY WAVE THAT WE -- 
TSUNAMI WAVE WE HEAR OF LATINOS 
HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE BALLOT 
BOX. 
IT'S GOING TO BE WAVE BY WAVE, 
BY WAVE. 
BUT BY 2030, ALL U.S. CITIZENS 
WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. 
AND COULD TURN ARIZONA FROM A 
RED CONSERVATIVE STATE TO A 
BLUE PROGRESSIVE STATE. 
>> LESLIE, YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN 
HERE? 
>> SURE. 
NO, YOU RAISED REALLY GOOD 
POINTS ABOUT DEMOGRAPHICS. 
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. 
THE PUSHBACK ON THAT IS THAT 
MANY OF THESE YOUNG LATINOS 
DON'T VOTE. 
DESPITE THE FACT THERE WILL BE 
HIGHER REGISTRATION. 
YOU GET LULACK OR THESE CIVIL 
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS GETTING 
THEM TO REGISTER. 
ARE YOU SEEING ANY CHANGES IN 
THE TREND TO GET THESE YOUNGER 
VOTERS TO THE POLL? 
>> YEAH, GETTING ANY YOUNGER 
PEOPLE TO THE POLLS IS VERY 
DIFFICULT. 
FACT, A RECENT STUDY, WE HAVE A 
REPORT OUT, THAT SHOWS THAT 
HALF OF MILLENNIALS DON'T EVEN 
REGISTER TO VOTE. 
AND OF THREE POOLS  WHO LARGELY 
DON'T VOTE. 
YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T VOTE, POOR 
PEOPLE DON'T VOTE, AND PEOPLE 
WITH SOMEWHAT OF A LIMITED 
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. 
CERTAINLY THEY DON'T FINISH 
HIGH SCHOOL, OR FINISH COLLEGE. 
THESE DON'T VOTE EITHER. 
AND LATINOS ARE REPRESENTED IN 
ALL THREE OF THOSE CATEGORIES. 
SO IT IS A CHALLENGE. 
BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT EMERGING 
LATINO VOTER. 
WE LOOKED AT STRAIGHT LINE 
PROJECTIONS. 
THAT IS EVEN WITH NOTHING 
CHANGING TODAY, WITH LAT OINOS 
-- LATINOS REGISTERING. 
THE LARGE NUMBER OF LAT -- 
LATINOS COMING IN THE PROCESS, 
ARIZONA WILL BECOME A MINORITY-
MAJORITY STATE BY 2030. 
IT'S JUST A GAME CHANGER. 
IT COULD HAPPEN SOONER IF MORE 
LATINOS BECOME INVOLVED AND 
ENGAGE IN POLITICS AND VOTE. 
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES 
THAT ARE FRONT AND CENTER IN 
ARIZONA? 
>> WELL, EVERYONE WANTS TO TALK 
ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION. 
BUT ACTUALLY, EDUCATION IS THE 
NUMBER 1 ISSUE IN ARIZONA. 
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG DECIDER 
WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE -- 
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG DECIDER 
IN MANY OF THE STATE HOUSE -- 
STATE RACES. 
EDUCATION IS THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE 
FOR LATINOS AND FOR ALL OF 
ARIZONANS. 
AND THAT IS BECAUSE LATINOS 
KNOW THAT THROUGH ONE WAY OUT 
OF POVERTY IS THROUGH 
EDUCATION. 
NOW, IMMIGRATION, THOUGH, IS 
IMPORTANT. 
BECAUSE FOR LATINOS, 
IMMIGRATION IS A VERY REAL AND 
PERSONAL ISSUE. 
FOR MANY LATINOS, THAT MAY MEAN 
A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY COULD BE 
DEPORTED. 
IT COULD BE A NEIGHBOR. 
IT COULD BE A COWORKER. 
A FRIEND. 
IT IS A VERY REAL, PERSONAL 
SITUATION. 
FOR MANY NONLAT OINEYS, -- 
NONLATINOS, IT IS A RHETORIC. 
THEY ARE NOT PERSONALLY 
IMPACTED. 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW 
ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN DEPORTED. 
IMMIGRATION IS A AN ISSUE BUT 
NOT THE KEY ISSUE. 
>> ARE THERE MORE COMPETITIVE 
RACES WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
LATINO VOTE? 
>> THE WAY THIS THING IS SET UP 
IS THAT ARIZONA HAS A SEMI OPEN 
PRIMARY SYSTEM. 
THAT MEANS EITHER YOU VOTE FOR 
THE DEMOCRATIC BALLOT OR THE 
REPUBLICAN BALLOT. 
AND OUR HUGE NUMBER OF 
INDEPENDENTS CAN CHOOSE ONE OF 
THE BALLOTS. 
UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY 10% OF 
INDEPENDENTS ACTUALLY VOTE IN 
THE PRIMARIES. 
AND A LOW NUMBER AS WELL, IN 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. 
SO NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
PARTICIPATE IN THE PRIMARIES, 
EVEN THOUGH OFTENTIMES, THE 
PRIMARY DECIDES THE ELECTION 
BECAUSE WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED, 
YOU KNOW, SAFE DISTRICTS. 
THAT'S ONE PARTY. 
EITHER THE DEMOCRATS OR 
REPUBLICANS, OVERWHELMINGLY 
OUTNUMBER IN THE OTHER PARTY IN 
CERTAIN DISTRICTS. 
SO 20 TO 22 OF ARIZONA'S 
LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS ARE 
CONSIDERED "SAFE" DISTRICTS, 
WHERE ONE PARTY, WHOEVER WINS 
THE PRIMARY IS PRETTY MUCH 
GUARANTEED THAT NOMINEE IS 
GOING TO WIN THE GENERAL 
ELECTION. 
FOR ARIZONA'S NINE 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, WE'RE 
ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE SAME 
THING. 
IT'S -- THERE ARE SAFE 
DISTRICTS. 
SO SIX OF NINE OF ARIZONA'S 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE 
SAFE AS WELL. 
-- WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE 
PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEED A 
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. 
IT'S THOSE OTHER STATES THAT 
ARE COMPETITIVE, WHERE YOU HAVE 
SWING DISTRICTS AND GO EITHER 
WAY. 
OR THE MOST COMPETITION. 
BUT DEMP CRATS HAVE -- 
DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN A 
DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY IN THIS 
APPROACH. 
WHERE THEY PUT DEMOCRATS IN 
RACES, WHERE THEY ARE IN SAFE 
DISTRICTS. 
SETTING IT UP FOR MAYBE NOT 
THIS ELECTION BUT MAYBE 
ELECTIONS ELECTIONS TO COME, 
WHERE DEMOCRATS CAN FIGHT FOR 
THOSE DISTRICTS. 
>> IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO 
WATCH THE DYNAMICS PLAY OUT IN 
YOUR STATE. 
JOSEPH GARCIA, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. 
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> LET'S TURN NOW TO SUSAN 
McMANNIS IS FLORIDA. 
SHE IS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST 
RAT THE -- SCIENTIST AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA. 
SUSAN, WE'RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE 
YOUR INSIGHT. 
THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT IN 
YOUR STATE, STARTING WITH 
ANDREW GILLUM. 
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK MADE THE 
DIFFERENCE HERE? 
HOW WAS HE ABLE TO SECURE THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR 
GOVERNOR? 
>> IT WAS LAST-MINUTE BUS TOUR 
AROUND THE STATE, ENERGY FROM 
BERNIE SANDERS, A LOT OF MONEY 
THAT WAS POURED IN SO THAT HE 
COULD ADVERTISE. 
IT WAS THE ENERGY AND THE 
TURNOUT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
FOR HIM AND THE BIG 
METROPOLITAN AREAS OF THE 
STATE. 
IT'S ALSO EVIDENT THAT HE GOT A 
LOT OF THE MINORITY VOTE AND 
THE YOUNG VOTE IN FLORIDA, 
WHICH IS NOW A LARGER PORTION 
OF FLORIDA'S ELECTORATE THAT 
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE. 
ABOUT 52% OF OUR ELECTORATE 
OVERALL, IS MILLENNIALS AND GEN-
EXERS AND THE HASHTAG 
GENERATION. 
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT OVER 
HALF OF FLORIDA'S REGISTERED 
DEMOCRATS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. 
AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE 
TAPPED INTO THE YOUNG VOTE AND 
THE PROGRESSIVE VOTE AND THE 
MINORITY VOTE. 
THAT WAS THE KEY TO VICTORY. 
AND IT WAS IN THE REALLY BIG 
URBAN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT 
HE PILED UP MARGINS OVER GWEN 
GRAHAM. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 
OF THIS. 
YOU HAD CONGRESSMAN RON 
DESANTIS, WHO WAS ENDORSED, OF 
COURSE, BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
HE WON THE GOP FOMINATION. 
AS SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT 
DESPITE DESANTIS BEING ABLE TO 
PULL OFF A WIN IN HIS PRIMARY, 
THAT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR 
HIM TO SORT OF GO BACK TO THE 
CENTER FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION 
TO BE COMPETITIVE IN WHAT IS 
STILL A SWING STATE. 
WHAT'S YOUR ANALYSIS? 
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 
VERY IDEOLOGICALLY-DRIVEN RACE. 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE GILLUM, OF ALL 
THE DEMOCRATS, WAS FARTHER TO 
THE LEFT, AND DE SANTIS, 
FARTHER TO THE RIGHT. 
THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO HAVE TO 
PIVOT AND MOVE. 
BECAUSE 28% OF FLORIDA'S 
REGISTERED VOTERS ARE NOT 
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. 
DESANT I GUESS TAPPED INTO THE 
TRUMP SUPPORT. 
IT WAS REALLY UNCLEAR AS TO 
WHETHER HE COULD REALLY RALLY 
THESE SOMETIMES VOTER THAT 
VOTED FOR HIM IN A MIDTERM 
ELECTION. 
BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY ABLE TO DO 
THAT, WITH VOTES -- I MEAN, 
WITH -- EXCUSE EXCUSE ME, WITH 
A BIG RALLY HERE IN TAMPA. 
AND CONSTANT TWEETS AND SO 
NORTH. 
-- FORTH. 
BUT IT WAS ALSO THE CASE THAT 
PUTNAM HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A 
PROBLEM WITH THE FACT THAT HE 
HAD BEEN IN OFFICE A LONG 
WHILE. 
SO I THINK LONGEVITY IN OFFICE 
IS NOT AN ASSET IN THIS 
PARTICULAR ELECTION CYCLE. 
IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALSO 
WATCHING FOR SENATOR NELSON 
FROM FLORIDA ON THE DEMOCRATIC 
SIDE. 
BUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES 
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PIVOT TO 
THE MIDDLE. 
>> SUSAN, IT'S ED O'KEEFE. 
AND WE SHOULD REMIND VIEWERS. 
SUSAN IS ONE OF THE PREMIERE 
EXPERTS ON FLORIDA POLITICS. 
IF YOU'RE AN OUT-OF-TOWN 
REPORTER, AND YOU NEED TON 
ABOUT FLORIDA ELECTIONS, YOU 
CALL SUSAN. 
AND SHE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
SUSAN, SET THIS AGAINST YOUR 
IDEOLOGUES, AGAINST THE MODERN 
POLITICAL HISTORY OF FLORIDA. 
HOW IS THIS RACE GOING TO SHAPE 
UP? 
AND WHERE IS THIS RACE GOING TO 
BE WON FOR EITHER OF THESE 
GUYS, IF THEY'VE GOT TO GO FIND 
INDEPENDENT VOTERS ACROSS THE 
STATE? 
>> IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S GOING 
TO BE ONE, I BELIEVE IN THE 
SUBURBAN AREAS OF THE STATE. 
THE SWING VOTERS, WHERE YOU 
HAVE FAMILIES. 
THE BELLWETHER KINDS OF 
COUNTIES, WHERE YOU SAW VOTERS  
WHO VOTED FOR OBAMA BUT ALSO 
THEN VOTED FOR TRUMP. 
THAT KIND OF VOTER. 
I THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE 
A BIG BATTLEGROUND. 
AND OF COURSE, OUR ELECTORATES 
CHANGE SO MUCH. 
WE'RE -- FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS NOW, WE'VE BITTEN BACK 
INTO THE SITUATION, WHERE WE 
HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE MOVING 
IN EVERY WEEK OR SO. 
SO OUR WHOLE POPULATION IS 
GROWN. 
AND OUR ELECTED HAS GROWN 7 
MILLION. 
SO I THINK THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF 
THE OF THE STATE -- OF THE 
STATE HAS LIFTED A LITTLE BIT. 
WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE TO LOOK 
AT THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING 
DEMOGRAPHIC OF OUR STATE, FOR 
BOTH PARTIES AND ALSO FOR NO-
PARTY AFFILIATION. 
BY THE WAY, THE LARGE, NO-PARTY 
AFFILIATION, PART OF OUR 
ELECTORATE, IS LARGELY, YOUNGER 
VOTERS. 
IN FACT, THE HASHTAG 
GENERATION, 18- TO 21-YEAR-
OLDS. 
40% ARE REGISTERING AS NO PARTY 
AFFILIATION. 
THAT'S WHY I SAY, THIS LARGE 
CLUMP OF NO PARTY AFFILIATION, 
AND EVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
PUERTO RICANS ARRIVING ARE 
REGISTERING AS NO ASMGZ. 
YOU -- AFFILIATION. 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS TIMEAT 
THINGS THAT MAKE PEOPLE 
ENERGIZED TO VOTE. 
>> THIS HASHTAG GENERATION. 
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WATHAT. 
SO 18 TO 21-YEAR-OLDS, THAT'S 
WHAT YOU CALL THE HASHTAG 
GENERATION. 
>> THE PEW RESEARCH CALLS IT 
THE Z GENERATION. 
BUT I'VE WILL RENAMED IT. 
THE HASHTAG GENERATION. 
>> YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST. 
>> IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE WON THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 
PARTICULAR CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN 
FOR DEMOCRATS WHEN IT COMES TO 
THAT PARTICULAR CONTEST? 
>> A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN 
TURNOUT. 
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS 
WE WERE REALLY WATCHING 
TONIGHT, WAS WHAT WOULD TURNOUT 
LOOK LIKE. 
IN THE CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE 
-- IN THE REGISTRATION, 
DEMOCRATIC-RICH REGERATION. 
BUT PARTICULARLY, WE WERE 
WATCHING MIAMI-DADE. 
BUT OF COURSE, BROWARD COUNTY, 
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE LATE TO 
COME IN THAT WERE WAS WATCHING 
CLOSELY. 
BECAUSE IN THE PAST, IT'S BEEN 
THE MINORITY VOTE IN THOSE KEY 
COUNTIES, WITH LARGE DEM 
CRATTIC -- DEMOCRATIC 
CONSTITUENCIES THAT HAVE NOT 
TURNED OUT IN MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
IT'S COST FLORIDA DEMOCRATS A 
COUPLE OF GUBERNATORIAL 
ELECTIONS. 
AND SOME COULD EVEN ARGUE IT 
COST THEM THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
LAST TIME. 
>> I'M JUST CURIOUS, TOO. 
WE WERE TALKING TO A REPORTER 
FROM WFOR, OUR CBS MIAMI 
STATION. 
WHO SAID, FOR ANDREW GILLUM, 
AMONG THE THINGS THAT HELPED 
PUSH HIM TO VICTORY, WERE THE 
ENDORSEMENT FROM BERNIE 
SANDERS. 
BUT ALSO, MAYOR GILLUM'S 
OPPOSITION TO "STAND YOUR 
GROUND." 
I WONDER, WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF 
HOW THE ISSUE OF THE PARKLAND 
SHOOTING, HOW THE ISSUE OF GUNS 
GENERALLY SHOULD BE VIEWED IN 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
>> WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT 
MANY HAVE DESCRIBED AS A MAJOR 
ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS. 
AND CERTAINLY GILLUM AND HIS 
ACCEPTANCE SPEECH TONIGHT, 
REALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT A LOT. 
AND STAND YOUR GROUND HAS BEEN 
A VERY MOBILIZING KIND OF ISSUE 
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, PROGRESSIVES, 
AND PARTICULARLY, PEOPLE OF 
COLOR IN OUR STATE. 
AND IT'S, OF COURSE, UNDER 
ATTACK AGAIN. 
I ALSO THINK THAT ANOTHER HUGE 
ISSUE IS THE ENVIRONMENT. 
AND AGAIN, I POINT TO THE 
GENERATIONAL SHIFTS IN FLORIDA, 
WHERE YOU HAVE THIS LARGER, 
YOUNG DEMOGRAPHIC NOW, THAT IS 
-- CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ONLY THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL GENERATION. 
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S 
PROBABLY EQUALLY AS MUCH OF A 
DRAW TO THE YOUNGER 
CONSTITUENTS, DEMOCRATS, 
ESPECIALLY, AS THE GUN ISSUE. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SENATE 
RACE. 
YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR 
RICK SCOTT, WINNING HIS 
PRIMARY, WHICH MEANINGS HE'LL 
FACE OFF AGAINST INCUMBENT 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, BILL 
NELSON. 
THIS IS ALREADY THE MOST 
EXPENSIVE RACE OF THE 2018 
MIDTERMS. 
THAT IS WITH GOVERNOR SCOTT 
OUTSPENDING NELSON BY A 4-1 
MARGIN SO FAR. 
HOW BIG OF A FACTOR IS THAT? 
>> WELL, IT'S STILL A TIED 
RACE. 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE KIND OF 
RACE THAT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE 
VINTAGE FLORIDA. 
AFTER ALL, THE LAST TWO 
GOVERNOR'S RACES, AND THE LAST 
TWO PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS. 
THE WINNER HAS ONLY PREVAILED 
BY 1%. 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS COULD BE 
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF 
RACES. 
BUT YOU HAVE THE CASE, I THINK, 
OF WHERE THE SENATE RACE IS, IN 
IN A WAY, GOING TO BE AFFECTED 
BY THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. 
BECAUSE IN MY OPINION. 
I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S 
RACE IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER 
DRAW -- DRAWING PEOPLE TO TURN 
OUT TO VOTE THAN IS THE U.S. 
SENATE RACE. 
BUT IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TO 
THE WIRE. 
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN SPENT. 
EACH OF THE CANDIDATES HAS A 
DIMENSION THAT THE OTHER ONE IS 
GOING AFTER. 
AND OF COURSE, THE ENVIRONMENT 
IS ONE. 
HEALTHCARE IS ANOTHER. 
BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE RACES 
THAT RIGHT NOW IS NOT AS 
EXCITING RIGHT NOW, AS THE 
GOVERNOR'S RACE. 
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT -- 
IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL 
CONSEQUENCE MEANS THE FIGHT 
WILL BE TO THE BITTER END. 
DEMOCRATS FIGHTING TO HOLD ONTO 
THE SEAT. 
AND REPUBLICANS DESPERATE TO 
PICK ONE WHERE THEY MIGHT LOSE 
ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
INSIGHT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> LET'S TURN TO ANTHONY 
SALVANTO. 
TELL US WHAT YOU'RE SEEING 
THERE. 
>> FIRST OF ALL. 
LET ME PUT THE MONEY ISSUE AND 
THE SPENDING, WHAT WE THINK IS 
GOING TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE 
SENATE RACE. 
IN PERSPECTIVE. 
FLORIDA IS A SWING STATE. 
IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE FEW SWING 
STATES THAT COVERS REALLY 
EXPENSIVE TELEVISION MARKETS. 
SO OTHER BIG EXPENSIVE STATES 
LIKE NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA 
AREN'T SWING STATES. 
BUT FLORIDA IS. 
SO IT'S EXPENSIVE TO RUN THERE. 
AND LET ME SHOW YOU THE GILLUM 
RACE HERE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
PRIMARY. 
AND THE PROFESSOR MENTIONED 
SOME OF THIS AS WELL. 
THESE AREAS THAT YOU SEE DOWN 
HERE THAT ARE SHADED IN A 
LITTLE BIT OF THIS PURPLE-GRAY, 
MIAMI-DADE, BROWARD COUNTY, 
THESE ARE PLACES WHERE GILLUM 
DID DO WELL, DID RUN UP SOME OF 
THOSE MARGINS. 
EVEN UP INTO PALM BEACH HERE, 
AS VOTES COME IN. 
A NARROW ONE. 
BUT HE HOLDS IT EVEN THERE. 
YOU GO UP HERE. 
LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY. 
THAT'S THE ORLANDO AREA. 
SO DEFINITELY IN THE CITIES. 
HE WAS ABLE TO RUN UP SOME SOME 
OF THOSE MARGINS. 
AND AS YOU MENTIONED, PULL OFF 
THE UPSET. 
RICK SCOTT, COMFORTABLY WINNING 
THROUGHOUT. 
SO THAT SETS UP THE SENATE 
RACE. 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN 
FLORIDA, AS WE THEN WAIT TO SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS. 
NOW, POLLS ARE CLOSED IN 
ARIZONA. 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA IN 
FROM THERE YET. 
ELAINE. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
ANTHONY SALVANTO. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
LET'S GO BACK TO OUR PANEL 
HERE. 
AND CHEW ON SOME OF WHAT WE 
HEARD FROM SUSAN MacMANUS. 
IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR 
CAITLIN -- TALK ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT THE IDEA OF SWING 
COUNTIES, THESE SUBURBAN VOTERS 
 
HARD-FOUGHT BATTLEGROUND 
TERRITORY FOR CANDIDATES. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK -- 
PARTICULARLY WITH THE 
GUBERNATORIAL CONTEST, WHAT DO 
YOU THINK THE CHALLENGES ARE 
GOING TO BE FOR EACH CANDIDATE 
THERE? 
>> WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. 
AND WE'RE SEEING THIS IN 
GEORGIA, TOO, IS THIS IDEA THAT 
IT'S GOING TO BE A BASE 
ELECTION ON THE GUBERNATORIAL 
ELECTION, AT LEAST. 
YOU HAVE UNABASHED IDEOLOGUE. 
TO BORROW SOME PHRASING FROM ED 
HERE. 
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE AN 
INTERESTING DYNAMIC. 
THEN PAIRED WITH THE SENATE 
RACE. 
REMEMBER THAT FLORIDA -- YOU 
KNOW, ALL EYES ARE GOING TO BE 
ON FLORIDA. 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY 
COMPETITIVE RACES. 
BUT ALSO NA LOT OF THESE -- IN 
A LOT OF THESE KEY DISTRICTS. 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY 
DISTRICTS. 
CARLOS -- DISTRICTS THAT 
HILLARY CLINTON WON 
OVERWHELMINGLY, TRYING TO 
CREATE THEIR OWN BRANDS IN 
THEIR DISTRICTS. 
TRYING TO LOCALIZE THOSE RACES 
AGAINST KIND OF THE NATIONAL, 
TIED. 
THAT WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING 
TO WATCH HERE, TOO. 
AND THOSE KINDS OF VOTERS, WILL 
BE REALLY CRITICAL IN THOSE 
DISTRICTS, TOO. 
TRYING TO GET VOTERS TO SEE, 
MAYBE IF THEY SPLIT THE TICKET. 
MAYBE IF THEY CAN SEPARATE 
THEMSELVES FROM THE NATIONAL 
úE 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 
DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE 
KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO 
SPEND AS MUCH TIME IN FLORIDA 
AS HE POSSIBLY CAN. 
HE LOVES CAMPAIGNING THERE. 
IT'S A STATE THAT HE JUST LOVES 
BEING IN 
SO THAT WILL BE KIND OF AN 
INTERESTING DYNAMIC HERE, TOO. 
LESLIE? 
>> REALLY INTERESTING POINT. 
BECAUSE I'M HEARING FROM MARIA 
ELVIRAS-SALAZAR, WHICH IS THE 
REPUBLICAN WHO WON THE 
NOMINATION FOR ILEANA ROTH 
LATON'S SEAT. 
SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF A 
MODERATE. 
SHE HAS LGBT RIGHTS WILL, MUCH 
MORE OF A GLOBAL LEADER. 
AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE 
SALAZAR IS HEARING HERSELF THE 
SAME WAY. 
SHE IS MODELING ILEANA VERY 
MUCH, THE CONGRESSWOMAN. 
GOING TO SEE HERSELF AS A MOD 
MODERATE. 
AND SHE WAS ASKED DIRECTLY, DO 
YOU WANT DONALD TRUMP TO 
SUPPORT YOU AND CAMPAIGN FOR 
YOU. 
AND SHE GOES, WE HAVE YET TO 
MAKE THAT DECISION. 
SO WHILE THIS WAVE OF TRUMP IS 
GOING TO BE TO BE FLYING INTO 
FLORIDA. 
IT'S GOING TO BE A SERIES OF 
EVASIVE MOVE MANEUVERS -- 
EVASIVE MANEUVERS. 
>> THIS IDEA OF COMPOLING 
CANDIDATE -- COMPELLING 
CANDIDATES TO WIN OUT THE DAY. 
REPUBLICANS HOPING FOR THAT. 
BUT DEMOCRATS CERTAINLY HAVE A 
LOT OF COMPELLING CANDIDATES 
THAT THEY'RE ENJOYING TOUTING 
THAT REPRESENT, YOU KNOW, THEIR 
DISTRICTS FOR STATES 
SPECIFICALLY. 
WE'LL SEE IF GILLUM DOES 
REPRESENT HIS IN THE NATIONAL 
TURNOUT. 
>> I MEAN, I'M WONDERING, FROM 
YOUR PERSPECTIVE, ANTOINE, AS A 
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, IF YOU 
ARE WATCHING PRESIDENT TRUMP 
COME INTO THE STATE OF FLORIDA 
AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THOSE 
SUBURBAN VOTERS AND THOSE SWING 
COUNTIES, THAT PROFESSOR 
MacMANUS TALKED ABOUT, THAT ARE 
GOING TO BE REALLY DECIDING 
FACTORS HERE. 
WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT WHEN YOU 
SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP COME INTO 
THE STATE, CAMPAIGNING FOR A 
RON DISANTIS, CAMPAIGNING 
AGAINST ANDREW GILLUM? 
>> FIRST OF ALL, I SAY, GAME 
ON. 
BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE REALIZED. 
AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN JUST BY 
PURE FACT. 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
AND SPECIAL ELECTIONS. 
SPECIAL SEATS, ET CETERA. 
THAT FRIENDS WILL NOT LET 
FRIENDS VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP 
AND HIS PARTY IN THESE 
ELECTIONLESS. 
SO BRING -- ELECTIONS. 
SO BRING TRUMP ON. 
THE FACT, THE ROAD FOR 
DEMOCRATS TO TAKE BACK 
CONGRESS, OR TO TAKE OUR 
COUNTRY BACK, WILL MEAN KEY 
RACES IN FLORIDA. 
AND GUESS WHAT. 
IN THOSE PLACES, AND I KNOW 
THIS FOR SURE, THE PRESIDENT IS 
NOT THE MOST POPULAR PERSON. 
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE 
CANDIDATES TRYING TO RUN FULL 
STEAM BACKWARD AWAY FROM HIM AS 
HE COMES INTO THE STATE, THAT 
MEANS HE'S GOING TO SUPPRESS A 
LOT OF VOTERS IN THOSE PLACES 
WHERE THE GOP WOULD NEED TO 
WIN, IN ORDER TO WIN THE STATE, 
VERSUS US THE SENATE AND THE 
GUBERNATORIAL RACE. 
THE OTHER FACTOR IS THAT THE 
PROFESSOR TALKED ABOUT THE 
SURGE AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
MOVING TO FLORIDA PER WEEK. 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THOSE 
PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO. 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THEY'RE 
COMING FROM. 
YOU CAN ALMOST COIN THEM IN THE 
DEMOCRATIC OR LEAN DEMOCRATIC 
CATEGORY. 
THAT'S A BIG GIFT FOR A PLACE 
LIKE FLORIDA. 
THAT'S A BIG GET FOR A 
PROGRESSIVE CAMP LIKE ANDREW 
GILLUM. 
THAT'S A BIG, SECURE GET, FOR A 
BILL NELSON, WHO IS A VERY 
MODERATE SENATOR. 
HE WON'T FIND HIM TAKING ON THE 
PROGRESSIVE ISSUESS IN THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
I THINK ALL OF THOSE THINGS, 
POSITION DEMOCRATS FOR 
NOVEMBER. 
LISTEN, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. 
THE CAR CAN DRIVE OFF THE ROAD. 
>> IF -- IF YOU'RE RICK SCOTT, 
YOU HAVE TO RUN A SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT RACE THAN RON 
DESANTIS TO WIN. 
I HAVE TO BELIEVE, GILLUM, THE 
NOMINEE HAS TO HELP GILLUM WITH 
THE BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS OF 
THE STATE. 
>> BASIC. 
NOT JUST BLACK AND BROWN. 
BECAUSE THERE'S PROGRESSIVE 
WHITES IN THE STATE, WHO 
TRADITIONALLY PROBABLY WOULDN'T 
BE AS EXCITED TO COME OUT AND 
PRESS THE BUTTON FOR A BILL 
NELSON TYPE BECAUSE HE'S A VERY 
MOODERATE SENATOR -- MODERATE 
SENATOR. 
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A 
LOT OF CONSISTENCY, BETWEEN 
DESANTIS AND SCOTT OR GILLUM. 
>> FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON. 
WE HAD A CLOSED PRIMARY. 
INDEPENDENTS DIDN'T HAVE A 
PLACE TO GO TODAY. 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO BE 
LOOKING LIKE? 
ARE THEY GOING TO BE LOOKING AT 
THIS VERY NEW, PROGRESSIVE, 
BLUE FLORIDA OTHER THAT IS END 
OF I.C.E., MEDICARE, SOME OF 
THE THEMES THAT YOU SAW? 
WHAT IS INTERESTING, I WOULD 
SAY, THOUGH, IS WHAT I THINK 
YOU SAW WITH GRAHAM, TWEETING 
RIGHT AAWAY TRYING TO COALLEYS 
THAT BASE. 
WE -- COALESCE. 
WE DON'T DO THAT AS FAST BUT 
THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING THE 
CORE BLOC OF WHAT THAT IS GOING 
TO LOOK LIKE. 
SOME INDEPENDENTS TEND TO LEAN 
DEMOCRATIC. 
>> IN FLORIDA. 
>> IN FLORIDA. 
THOSE SMALL PERCENTAGES. 
THAT MAY BE THE MARGIN, ED. 
ARE THEY LEFT-LEANING INDIES 
WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES 
WHO WILL MOBILIZE. 
>> THE KEY FOR DEMOCRATS, YOU 
BROUGHT UP A VERY VALID POINT 
IS FOR US TO BE ROCK SOLID, 
UNITED ON ALL POINTS. 
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ONE 
CRACK WITHIN THE PARTY. 
AND THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS 
WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT IN 
2016. 
IN SPITE OF ALL THE THINGS 
TRUMP SAID AND DONE, THEY MAY 
HAVE COME FROM THE CAMPAIGN, 
REPUBLICANS SAID, YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE 
PARTY. 
VERSUS DEMOCRATS, YOU HAD THE 
PROGRESSIVE AND THE BERNIE, 
PRIMARY VOTER SAYING WE'RE 
GOING TO VOTE THIRD PARTY OR 
NOT SHOW UP AT ALL, OR WRITE IN 
CANDIDATES. 
AND IN SOME PLACES, THAT MADE 
ALL THE DIFFERENCE. 
THE OTHER THING, I CAUTION MY 
DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS ABOUT IS 
WIPE OUT EVERY POLL THAT YOU 
SEE, WHETHER IT'S GENERIC OR 
WHETHER IT HAS -- WHATEVER IT 
SAYS. 
BECAUSE POLLS DO NOT MATTER IN 
AN ENVIRONMENT NA RACE LIKE 
THIS -- IN A RACE LIKE THIS. 
BECAUSE POLLS ARE A SIMPLE 
SNAPSHOT OF THE TIME. 
AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL 
NOT TO FALL INTO THE HILLARY 
CLINTON 2016 TRAP. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN OUR 
ANTHONY SALVANTO. 
WE HAVE TO SNEAK IN A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE PRIMARY 
NIGHT COVERAGE WHEN WE RETURN. 
INCLUDING A LOOK AT WHAT TO 
EXPECT COME NOVEMBER. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> WE'RE LAUNCHING A NEW 
SERIES, CALL PAY ATTENTION. 
>> JOHN IS OUR GUINEA PIG. 
AS WE EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF 
TECHNOLOGY ON OUR ABILITY TO 
FOCUS. 
>> CAN YOU GO OFF, DOWN A 
RABBIT HOLE AND TELLS YOU. 
>> I'M GETTING ANOTHER 
INSTAGRAM PHOTO. 
>> THE TEXT. 
>> TODAY, I'VE GONE WITHOUT 
TECHNOLOGY. 
AND INCREASINGLY, I'VE HAD THIS 
HUNTED FEELING. 
>> YOU'RE STEPPING IN THE WAY 
OF A HABIT. 
IT'S HARD. 
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THROWING AWAY 
YOUR PHONE. 
IT'S ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH YOUR PHONE. 
STORE -- 
>>> WELCOME BACK TO CBSN. 
THE POLLS ARE NOW CLOSED IN 
BOTH ARIZONA AND FLORIDA. 
I WANT TO BRING IN LARRY 
SABIDO. 
AND LARRY, FIRST OF ALL, LET'S 
GET YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE HAVE 
SEEN IN FLORIDA TONIGHT, WITH 
ANDREW GILLUM AND RON DESANTIS, 
WINNING THEIR RESPECTIVE RACES. 
>> DESANTIS WAS EXPECTED. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN 
BEATING THE DRUMS FOR HIM FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
AND TRUMP IS ACTUALLY MORE 
POPULAR OR HAS MAINTAINED HIS 
POPULARITY IN FLORIDA. 
MUCH BETTER THAN HE HAS IN 
OTHER STATES. 
THERE'S SOME KIND OF TIE THERE 
BEYOND WINNING THE ELECTION IN 
2016. 
SO DESANTIS, AS EXPECTED, 
DEFEATED THE ORIGINAL FRONT 
RUNNER. 
FRONT RUNNER BY A MILE, ADAM 
PUTNAM. 
AND NOW, AN EVEN BIGGER UPSET 
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, A GIANT 
UPSET, WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR 
NOT, MOST DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN 
FLORIDA HAVE BEEN PRETTY HONEST 
IN SAYING THEY BELIEVE THAT 
GWEN GRAHAM HAD A MUCH BETTER 
CHANCE OF WINNING THE GENTLEMAN 
ELECTION THAN ANDREW GILLUM. 
MAYBE THEY'RE WRONG. 
WHAT GETTING GET -- GOING TO 
DEPEND ON, IN MY VIEW, IS 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A TRULY 
SUBSTANTIAL DEMOCRATIC WAVE. 
WE DON'T SEE EVIDENCE FOR IT 
YET. 
AND I THINK ANTHONY SALVANTO 
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT, BASED ON 
THE CBS POLLS OUT SO FAR. 
MAYBE IT WILL BE CLOSER TO 
ELECTION DAY. 
BUT IF THERE IS A WAVE, THINK 
ABOUT IT SWEEPING ACROSS THE 
UNITED STATES. 
AND HOW COULD IT MISS FLORIDA? 
FLORIDA IS A PENINSULA. 
AT LEAST IN IN THIS 
METAPHORICAL WAY, FLORIDA WOULD 
HAVE TO BE INCLUDED. 
BUT IT HAS TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL 
WAY FOR GILLUM TO WIN. 
WHAT GIVES HIM THE CHANCE OF 
WINNING IS NOT ONLY THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A BLUE WAVE. 
BUT ALSO, DESANTIS IS EVERY BIT 
AS FAR RIGHT AS GILLUM WILL BE 
CONSIDERED FAR LEFT. 
AS YOUR FLORIDA EXPERT WAS ON, 
SHE REALLY WAS A TERRIFIC 
EXPERT, SUSAN MacMANUS. 
SUSAN WAS SUGGESTING, THIS IS A 
REAL STRUGGLE FOR PEOPLE WHO 
ARE IN THE REAL CENTER. 
DO THEY GO LEFT? 
OR DO THEY GO RIGHT? 
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO MIDDLE. 
>> SO I'M CURIOUS. 
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF 
THAT KIND OF A MATCHUP WHERE 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE 
CANDIDATES WHO ARE NOT CLOSE TO 
THE MIDDLE? 
>> ELAINE, IT FITS OUR MOOD IN 
THIS COUNTRY PERFECTLY. 
WE ARE AS POLARIZED AS ANY TIME 
IN MY LIFETIME. 
I THOUGHT FOR A WHILE THE 
1960s, THE LATE '60s AND EARLY 
'70s WOULD FOREVER BE THE MOST 
POLARIZED PERIOD, AT LEAST 
WHILE I WAS ON EARTH. 
WELL, WRONG. 
WE ARE MORE POLARIZED NOW, I 
THINK, BY A MILE, THAN WE WERE 
THEN. 
AND IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THERE 
IS NO CENTER. 
THE CENTER DOESN'T HOLD. 
WE USED TO SAY, THE CENTER 
HOLDS. 
NO, THE CENTER HAS BEEN BLOWN 
APART. 
AND YOUR CHOICES NOW ARE RIGHT, 
TRUMPIST, AND LEFT, FILL IN THE 
BLANK. 
IS IT BERNIE SANDER. 
>> WHO EVERY IS -- WHOEVER IS 
NOMINATED. 
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE LEFT 
VERSUS RIGHT. 
AND THE MIDDLE WILL JUST HAVE 
TO LIVE WITH IT. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF 
THE RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE BEEN 
DOING. 
YOU RECENTLY LAUNCHED A MIDTERM 
TRACKING TOOL WITH INSUS. 
WHAT DID YOU FIND -- IPSUS. 
WHAT DID YOU FIND IN TERMS OF 
HOUSE RACES? 
>> WELL, WITH HOUSE RACES, OF 
COURSE, SOME ARE NOT WELL-
FORMED. 
THEY TEND TO BREAK LATER IN THE 
ELECTION PERIOD. 
AND WE'VE GOT THE COUPLE OF 
MONTHS TO GO. 
BUT AS FAR AS SOCIAL MEDIA IS 
CONCERNED, IT'S INTERESTING. 
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR, 
AGAIN, THE ENERGY IS ON THE 
RIGHT AND THE LEFT. 
THEY'RE PUSHING CANDIDATES ON 
THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT. 
THE MOPY COMES -- MONEY COMES 
IN TO THE CANDIDATES ON THE 
RIGHT AND THE LEFT. 
WE DID ALSO DISCOVER SOMETHING 
INTERESTING. 
AND I GIVE FULL CREDIT TO IPSUS 
FOR THIS. 
THEY HAVE A WAY, A VERY CAREFUL 
WAY OF PRESENTING WHAT 
PERCENTAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR 
EACH CANDIDATE IS GENERATED BY 
BOTS. 
BY THESE ROBOTS ON TWITTER. 
AND IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE. 
YOU CAN HAVE A DECENT 
PERCENTAGE -- IT'S GENERALLY IN 
THE SINGLE DIGITS. 
BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF THE 
MILLIONS OF TWEETS INVOLVED, 
IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE SENATE AND 
GOVERNOR RACES? 
>> WELL, THE SENATE -- OF 
COURSE, DEPENDS ON THE MAP THAT 
IS UP IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. 
AND WE'VE GONE BACK AND LOOKED 
AT EVERY SINGLE SENATE MAP FROM 
THE BEGINNING OF POPULAR 
ELECTION AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THE 20th CENTURY TO THE 
PRESENT. 
THIS IS ARGUABLY, THE WORST MAP 
FOR EITHER PARTY EVER. 
AND OF COURSE, IT'S THE WORST 
MAP FOR THE DEMOCRATS. 
THEY ARE TREMENDOUSLY EXPOSED, 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE 26 OF THE 
SENATE SEATS UP. 
ONLY A THIRD OF THE SENATES 
ELECTED. 
AND 10 OF THEM ARE IN STATES 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BY 
MARGINS UP TO OVER 40%. 
IT WILL BE A MIRACLE, IF 
DEMOCRATS TAKE THE SENATE. 
IT IS AT LEAST AS POSSIBLE, 
MAYBE MORE POSSIBLE, THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS WILL ADD SEATS IN 
THE SENATE. 
SO IN THAT SENSE, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, FOR HIS SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATIONS, OR CABINET 
NOMINATIONS, LOWER COURT JUDGE 
NOMINATIONS, MIGHT END UP IN AS 
GOOD OR EVEN BETTER SHAPE, EVEN 
IF HE LOSES THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES, WHICH I THINK 
IS SLIGHTLY PROBABLE RIGHT NOW. 
YOU'D HAVE TO CALL THE 
DEMOCRATS AT LEAST SOFT 
FAVORITES FOR THE HOUSE. 
THOUGH THAT COULD CHANGE BY 
NOVEMBER. 
>> WHAT ABOUT ISSUES, LARRY? 
WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
ISSUES TO VOTERS THIS ELECTION 
CYCLE? 
>> WELL, THANKS TO OUR FRIENDS 
AT IPSOS AND THE MODELS THAT WE 
HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTING FOR THIS 
NEW POLITICAL ATLAS. 
THAT'S CLEAR. 
FOR THE REPUBLICANS, THE 
LEADING ISSUE BY A MILE IS 
IMMIGRATION. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY TODAY, WHICH IS THE TRUMP 
PARTY, IT'S NOT THE OLD 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
IT'S THE TRUMP PARTY. 
THEY LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
HE PROBABLY STRESSES 
IMMIGRATION MORE THAN ANY OTHER 
ISSUE. 
IT PROBABLY HELPED HIM TO GET 
ELECTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER 
ISSUE. 
FOR THE DEMOCRATS, 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE TOP 
ISSUE IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE. 
IT'S DONALD TRUMP. 
DONALD TRUMP MOTIVATES 
DEMOCRATS MORE THAN ANY SINGLE 
ISSUE. 
THOUGH IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE, 
YOU'D PICK HEALTHCARE. 
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ISSUE, 
ISSUE, THEY'RE MOST CONCERNED 
ABOUT. 
BUT THEY ARE MOTIVATED BY 
DONALD TRUMP IN THE SENSE THAT 
THEY WANT TO GET OUT AND VOTE 
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BY 
ELECTING A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS. 
>> AND SO GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST 
LAID OUT THERE. 
HAS MUCH CHANGED IN THE WAY OF 
HOW VOTERS FEEL WITH RESPECT TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPROVAL 
RATING? 
>> IT'S BEEN REMARKABLY STABLE. 
HE HAD A ROUGH FIRST FEW 
MONTHS, REALLY HALF A YEAR, 
MAYBE LONGER THAN HALF A YEAR. 
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED? 
BECAUSE THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN 
GOOD. 
BECAUSE TRUMP HAS ACHIEVED SOME 
OF HIS GOALS. 
IT SATISFIED THE 46% OF 
AMERICANS WHO VOTED FOR HIM. 
OF COURSE, HIS BASE, WHICH IS 
SOMEWHERE AROUND 35% OF THE 
WHOLE COUNTRY, WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ENTHUSIASTIC IF HE HADN'T 
SUCCESS SUCCEEDED IN ANYTHING. 
THEY WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN FOR 
TRUMP, FOR REPUBLICANS FOR THE 
PARTY. 
BUT WHAT TRUMP HAS BEEN AGE TO 
-- ABLE TO DO IS TO ADD BACK 
INTO THE MIX, THE ADDITIONAL 
PERCENTAGE POINTS THAT GOT HIM 
UP TO 46. 
AND EVEN THOUGH HE LOST THE 
POPULAR VOTE AS WE KNOW, HE WON 
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE. 
SO HE IS ABOUT WHERE HE WAS ON 
ELECTION DAY. 
I DOUBT HE GOES ANY FURTHER OR 
MUCH FURTHER. 
I DOUBT HE'S A MAJORITY PRESENT 
EVER. 
BUT HE'S GOT ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN 
HIS PRESIDENCY, AND GIVEN WHO 
THE DEMOCRATS MAY NOMINATE, 
PERHAPS TO WIN RE-ELECTION. 
>> SO WE KNOW, LARRY, THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SUGGESTED THAT THERE 
WOULD BE VIOLENCE, IF THE GOP 
WERE TO LOSE IN THE MIDTERMS. 
I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF THOSE REMARKS FROM THE 
PRESIDENT? 
>> OH, I THINK THEY'RE JUST 
NONSENSICAL. 
WHO KNOWS WHERE HE WAS GOING OR 
WHY HE SAID IT. 
HE SAYS SO MANY THINGS THAT 
TURN OUT NOT TO BE TRUE, OR 
WHICH THERE IS NO FACTUAL 
BASIS. 
THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS. 
YOU COULD POSTULATE THAT THERE 
IS GOING TO BE VIOLENCE, 
UNFORTUNATELY. 
AND I HOPE IT ISN'T TRUE. 
BUT THERE COULD BE VIOLENCE, AS 
WE CONTINUE ALONG THIS 
POLARIZED PATH. 
THE MORE POLARIZED WE GET, THE 
MORE LIKELY THERE IS TO BE 
VIOLENCE, THOUGH. 
MAYBE THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE, 
LIVING IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
EXCELLENT POINT THERE. 
LARRY SABATO, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FO YOUR TIME. 
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 
>> THANK YOU, ELAINE. 
>>> GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE PRIMARY 
NIGHT COVERAGE, WHEN WE RETURN. 
INCLUDING A LOOK AT CONCERNS 
ABOUT ELECTION HACKING. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> HELLO. 
I'M BILL WHITAKER, WITH "60 
MINUTES." 
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 
CONGRESSMAN MORENO. 
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS 
OUT OF CONTROL. 
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 
PEOPLE DIE. 
>> WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN 
ABOUT THIS WITHOUT "60 
MINUTES." 
>> I DID SEE THE REPORT. 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE 
REPORT. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY 
SERIOUSLY. 
>> THEY WERE JUST DRUG DEALERS 
IN LAB COATS. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 
PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 
>>> ELECTION HACKING BECAME A 
HOT TOPIC IN FLORIDA'S PRIMARY, 
AFTER A REPORT OF AN 11-YEAR-
OLD MANAGING TO HACK A REPLICA 
OF A FLORIDA WEBSITE -- VOTING 
WEBSITE, EARLIER THIS MONTH. 
BUT FLORIDA ELECTION OFFICIALS 
ARE PUSHING BACK AGAINST THAT 
REPORT. 
JOINING ME NOW TO TALK ABOUT 
THIS IS DAN PATTERSON. 
HE'S THE SENIOR PRODUCER FOR 
CNET AND CBS NEWS. 
DAN, BREAK THIS DOWN FOR US. 
BECAUSE THIS WAS COMING OUT OF 
THIS HACKING CONFERENCE, KNOWN 
AS DEF CON, WHERE YOU HAD AN 11-
YEAR-OLD, WHO HACKED WHAT WAS 
ALLEGED TO BE A REPLICA OF A 
FLORIDA VOTING WEBSITE. 
WHAT'S THE REAL STORY HERE? 
>> YEAH. 
SO THIS WAS A REPLICA OF A SITE 
THAT RESEMBLED THE FLORIDA 
WEBSITE. 
AND IT WAS INTENDED AS A 
DEMPISTRATION OF -- 
DEMONSTRATION OF HOW EASY IT IS 
TO HACK SOME WEBSITES. 
THE CONFUSION HERE CAME WITH 
THE USE OF THE FLORIDA WEBSITE. 
SO WE TALKED TO THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA. 
AND THEY PUSHED BACK PRETTY 
HARD. 
UNDERSTANDABLY. 
SO THIS WAS A WEBSITE THAT WAS 
DESIGNED TO LOOK AND FEEL AS 
THOUGH IT WAS FLORIDA. 
BUT IT WAS NOT CONNECTED TO ANY 
FLORIDA SYSTEMS. 
AND IN FACT, THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA SAID THAT LOOK, WE 
WOULD BE CRAZY -- I'M 
PARAPHRASING A LITTLE BIT HERE. 
BUT WE WOULD BE CRAZY TO NOT 
ONLY GIVE OUR WEBSITE FOR A 
DEMONSTRATION. 
BUT TO CONNECT OUR WEBSITES TO 
THE DATABASES AND OTHER 
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT 
POWERS OUR VOTING SYSTEMS. 
SO IT'S AN EASY HEADLINE. 
IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND 
WHY DEMONSTRATIONS CAN BE 
MISCONSTRUED. 
BUT THE USE OF THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA FOR THIS HACKING 
DEMONSTRATION, BOARDED -- 
BORDERED ON IRRESPONSIBLE. 
>> WHART IMPATIONS -- WHAT ARE 
THE IMPLICATIONS OF SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT HAPPENING. 
WHAT ARE THE BROADER 
IMPLICATIONS. 
>> YOU SAID THE RIGHT WORDS 
THERE. 
WE ARE RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT NOT 
JUST RUSSIAN METTLING. 
BUT IRANIAN METTLING. 
THE -- MEDDLING, THE NORTH 
KOREANS. 
EVERYONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO 
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDDLING, 
WHETHER IT'S FROM ACTUAL 
DATABASE TAMPERING TO CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE TAMPERING. 
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT THIS 
NOW, AND THROWING UP RED FLAGS 
LIKE THIS PUTS US ON KIND OF A 
SCARE ALERT THAT IS NOT ONLY 
UNNECESSARY, BUT IT DISTRACTS 
FROM THE REAL CHALLENGES THAT 
DO ACTUALLY EXIST IN THE CYBER 
AND POLITICAL ECOSYSTEM. 
>> SO ONE OF THE STORY LINES 
THAT I HAD READ IN FLORIDA. 
ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE 
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT SENATOR, 
BILL NELSON, WHO REPORTEDLY 
SAID THAT RUSSIAN OPERATIVES 
HAD TARGETED FLORIDA VOTING 
SYSTEMS, AHEAD OF TONIGHT'S 
PRIMARIES. 
AND THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD THE 
TAMPA BAY TIMES. 
QUOTE. 
THEY HAVE ALREADY PENETRATED 
CERTAIN COUNTIES IN THE STATE. 
AND THEY NOW HAVE FREE REIGN TO 
MOVE ABOUT. 
SO DAN. 
WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE? 
WAS THERE ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE 
TO SUPPORT THESE CLAIMS? 
>> THE CLAIMS FROM NELSON ARE 
-- THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE TO 
SUPPORT THIS. 
AND ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS A 
REALLY, REALLY CHALLENGING 
THING FOR HIM TO ASSERT. 
BECAUSE AGAIN, RUSSIAN ACTORS 
AND OTHER FOREIGN ADVERSARIES 
ARE TAMPERING WITH OUR SYSTEMS, 
WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
SYSTEMS. 
BUT TO ALLEGE THIS WITHOUT ANY 
TYPE OF EVIDENCE, AGAIN, MAKES 
THE CYBER WORLD FEEL AS THOUGH 
WE ARE WORKING ON VERY SERIOUS 
FORENSIC EVIDENCE TO TRACK THE 
ACTUAL MEDDLING THAT IS 
HAPPENING. 
AND WHEN WE CONFUSE THAT 
ECOSYSTEM. 
WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIVISION 
AND THE DISTRUST OF 
ORGANIZATIONS AND OF 
INSTITUTIONS THAT IS ALREADY 
PERCOLATING UP TO THE SURFACE 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> RIGHT. 
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE 
WHO ARE QUESTIONING WHAT IS 
SORT OF REAL, WHAT'S NOT REAL. 
BUT YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE 
WATCHING THIS, IS THIS THREAT 
OF ELECTION HACKING SOMETHING 
THAT THEY SHOULD REALLY BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT? 
>> YES. 
ELECTION MEDDLING, ELECTION 
HACKING, AND TAMPERING, IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY -- IS 
REAL. 
IT IS ONGOING. 
AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT 
HAPPEN ALL OVER THE WORLD, NOT 
JUST IN THE UNITED STATES. 
IN FACT, ON CBSNEWS.COM 
STARTING NEXT WEEK, WE'LL RUN A 
LONG SERIES, DETAILING EXACTLY 
HOW ELECTION HACKING HAPPENS. 
AND THE ACTUAL FACTS OF WHERE, 
HOW AND WHO IS TAMPERING WITH 
ELECTIONS. 
BUT WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE LIKE 
NELSON AND OTHERS ASSERTING 
FALSE CLAIMS, IT CONTRIBUTES TO 
THE "FAKE NEWS" DIALOGUE THAT 
CONTINUES TO COME FROM CERTAIN 
SECTORS OF THE POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT. 
>> RIGHT. 
OR CLAIMS WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY 
CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED OR NOT. 
>> EXACTLY. 
>> LOOK FORWARD TO THAT SERIES, 
DAN PATTERSON, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TOP 
ECONOMIC ADVISER SAYS THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING INTO 
POSSIBLE REGULATIONS ON TECH 
GIANTS LIKE GOOGLE. 
THE REVELATION CAME AFTER AN 
EARLY-MORNING PRESIDENTIAL 
TWEET, ACCUSING THE SEARCH 
ENGINE OF POLITICAL BIAS. 
MOLA LENGHI REPORTS FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CRITICIZED 
THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR SEARCH

HE TWEETED TONLY SHOWS THE

THEY ISSUED A STATEMENT, SAYING

SPECIAL ELECTION NIGHT COVERAGE 
OF THE ARIZONA AND FLORIDA 
PRIMARIES. 
POLLS ARE CLOSED. 
IN BOTH STATES. 
AND RIGHT NOW, WE WANT TO TAKE 
TO YOU ARIZONA, WHERE JIM 
NITLE, WHO SILENT EXECUTIVE 
EDITOR FOR THE TUCSON WEEKLY IS 
JOINING US. 
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH 
US, JIM. 
LET'S START WITH RETIRING 
JEASHT SENATOR JEFF FLAKE'S 
SEAT. 
THERE ARE THREE REPUBLICANS, 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
THEM? 
>> WOON IS PROBABLY GOING TO 
COME OUT ON TOP IS MARTHA 
McSALLY. 
SHE'S A CONGRESSWOMAN FROM 
SOUTHERN ARIZONA. 
HAS A LONG RECORD IN THE U.S. 
AIR FORCE. 
SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO FLY 
AN A-10 PLANE INTO COMBAT. 
FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD AN A-10 
SQUADRON AND WAS INSTRUMENTAL 
IN KEEPING THE A10 GOING 
THROUGH RECENT YEARS OF EFFORTS 
TO MOTH BALL THE AIRPLANE, 
WHICH DOES A LOST AIR SUPPORT 
IN WAR ZONES. 
SHE CAN RAISE A LOT MORE MONEY 
THAN THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES 
IN THE RACE AND IS A FIERCE 
CAMPAIGNER. 
SHE IS GOING UP AGAINST KELLY 
WARD, A FORMER STATE LAWMAKER 
WHO CHALLENGED JOHN McCAIN, 
UNSUCCESSFULLY, TWO YEARS AGO. 
THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE A BETTER 
CHANCE AGAINST JEFF FLICK THIS 
YEAR, BUT THEN JEFF FLAKE 
ANNOUNCED HE WAS RETIRING TO 
AVOID THAT PRIMARY. 
THEN YOU HAVE SHERIFF JOE 
ARPAIO, WHO I THINK IS PRETTY 
WELL KNOWN TO YOUR VIEWERS AS 
AMERICA'S TOUGHEST SHERIFF. 
ENDED HIS CAREER IN DISGRACE. 
ENDED UP BEING KNOCKED OUT BY 
THE VOTERS IN MARICOPA COUNTY. 
THEN ALSO, CONVICTED AND LATER 
PARDONED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 
VIOLATIONS OF A COURT ORDER. 
>> AND IT'S INTERESTING. 
ALL THREE OF THOSE CANDIDATES 
HAVE EMBRACED PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
AND YET HE HAS NOT EPIDORSED 
ANY OF -- NOT ENDORSED ANY OF 
THEM. 
TELL US ABOUT THAT. 
>> YEAH, MARTHA McSALLY, BEFORE 
SHE GOT INVOLVED IN RUNNING FOR 
THE STATEWIDE SEAT, SERVED A 
VERY COMPETITIVE DISTRICT HERE 
IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA. 
AND ACTUALLY KEPT HER DISTANCE 
FROM DONALD TRUMP. 
DID NOT SAY IF SHE WOULD VOTE 
FOR HIM. 
DID NOT ENDORSE HIM. 
CONDEMNED HIM AFTER THE ACCESS 
HOLLYWOOD TAPE EMERGED IN 2016. 
BUT SINCE HER PLANS TO RUN FOR 
STATEWIDE U.S. SENATE HAS 
GOTTEN CLOSE TO DONALD TRUMP. 
HE SAID VERY NICE THINGS ABOUT 
HER. 
SHE WAS THERE FOR THE SIGNING 
OF THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 
BILL RECENTLY. 
BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS KIND OF 
STEERED CLEAR OF MAKING HIS 
ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE. 
HE HAS OBVIOUSLY HAD A LONG AND 
TIGHT ALLIANCE WITH JOE ARPAIO. 
AND KELLY WARD IS ALSO REALLY 
SOUGHT HIS APPROVAL FOR 
WHATEVER REASON, HE'S KIND. 
STEERED CLEAR OF SAYING 
ANYTHING TO ANY OF THESE GUYS. 
>> LET'S TALK DEMOCRATS. 
LAST TIME A DEMOCRAT WAS 
ELECTED TO THE U.S. ARIZONA 
SENATE, WAS 1988. 
WHO ARE THE DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATES? 
AND WHAT ARE THEIR CHANCES? 
>> THERE'S A CONGRESSWOMAN OUT 
OF PHOENIX, NAMED KIRSTEN 
CINEMA. 
SHE IS A DEMOCRAT WHO HAS VOTED 
ALONGSIDE REPUBLICANS IN A 
BIPARTISAN FASHION IN RECENT 
YEARS, I THINK PROBABLY 
PREPPING HERSELF FOR THIS 
STATEWIDE RACE. 
RIGHT NOW, POLLS SHOW HER 
LEADING ALL THREE OF THOSE 
REPUBLIAN CANDIDATES. 
BUT THAT'S A SPLIT FIELD. 
AND I THINK LIKELY, MARTHA 
McSALLY'S EMERGENCE IN THIS 
RACE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE 
REPUBLICANS COALLEYSING BEHIND 
HER. 
PEOPLE SAY, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING 
TO -- ARIZONA IS A PURPLE 
STATE. 
AND DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO 
START WINNING STATEWIDE AGAIN. 
I'LL IN A -- I'M IN A POSITION 
WHERE I WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN I 
SEE IT. 
>> MARTHMARTHA McSALLY IS 
ALREADY IN AN AD. 
>> I'M LEADING SECURITY. 
WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 
DO EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO IN 
OUR CAN COUNTRY. 
>> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING IS, I SUPPORT THE 
PRESIDENT AND ALWAYS HAVE. 
>> I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT FROM 
DAY 1. 
>> THAT WAS THE WRONG SOUND. 
BUT THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT AGO. 
THAT IS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. 
YOU HAVE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE 
VERY MUCH RUSHED TO EMBRACE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
SINCE WE JUST HEARD THAT. 
LET ME REDIRECT MY QUESTION, 
BACK TO WHAT WE JUST HEARD 
THERE. 
HOW DIFFICULT WILL IT BE, GIVEN 
WHAT WE JUST HEARD THERE? 
GIVEN HOW THEY TRIED TO TACK 
TRY TO THE RIGHT FOR THE 
EVENTUAL VICTOR THERE ON THE 
RIGHT. 
FOR A FAIR AND GENERAL ELECTION 
IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA? 
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO 
FIND THE ANSWERS OUT TO IN 
NOVEMBER. 
BUT I THINK WHAT IS REALLY 
INTERESTING THERE IS HOW MUCH 
MARTHA McSALLY HAS EMBRACED 
DONALD TRUMP, THE LIKELY WINNER 
OF THIS ELECTION TONIGHT. 
COMPARED TO KIRSTEN CINEMA, WHO 
IS TELLING PEOPLE, I DON'T 
THINK DONALD TRUMP IS A FACTOR 
IN THIS CASE. 
I DON'T THINK THIS RACE IS 
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, IT'S ABOUT 
WHAT PEOPLE IN ARIZONA NEED. 
IT'S ABOUT MOVING THE COUNTRY 
FORWARD. 
THAT KIND OF RHETORIC. 
AND I THINK AS MUCH AS KIRSTEN 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT, IT WILL 
BE LARGELY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. 
HE IS GOING TO BE HANGING OVER 
ALL OF THESE CONGRESSIONAL AND 
SENATE AND EVEN GUBERNATORIAL 
RACES HERE THIS YEAR. 
AND THIS, IF ANYTHING, 
DEMOCRATS DO HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY, IF THEY CAN 
CAPITALIZE ON PEOPLE'S CONCERNS 
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND MAKE THE 
NARRATIVE ABOUT BEING A 
WATCHDOG OVER THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION. 
>> WELL, UNTIL -- I'M TOLD NOW, 
WE HAVE MARTHA McSALLY GOING 
AFTER KIRSTEN CINEMA NOW. 
LET'S PLAY THAT AD AD FOR 
VIEWERS. 
>> EVERYONE REMEMBERS WHERE 
THEY WERE ON 9/11. 
I WAS DEPLOYED TO THE MIDDLE 
EAST. 
LED AIR STRIKES AGAINST THE 
TALIBAN AND WAS FIRST WOMAN TO 
FLY A JET IN COMBAT. 
I KNOW THE PRICE OF FREEDOM. 
WHILE WE WERE IN HARM'S WAY, IN 
UNIFORM, KIRSTEN CINEMA WAS 
PROTESTING US IN A PINK TUTU, 
AND DENIGRATING OUR SERVICE. 
THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE. 
WE NEED STRONG LEADERS WHO 
UNDERSTAND THE THREAT. 
KIRSTEN CINEMA FAILED THE TEST. 
I'M MARTHA McSALLY AND I 
APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. 
>> THAT PARTICULAR APPROACH, 
GOING AFTER A CANDIDATE'S ANTI-
WAR PROTEST. 
>> CERTAINLY NAIMAGE OF A PINK 
TUTU, CONTRASTED WITH MARTHA 
McSALLY, IN THE COCKPIT OF A 
FIGHTER PLANE, IS NOT A GOOD 
IMAGE FOR KIRSTEN CINEMA. 
THAT WAS TAKEN A LONG TIME AGO. 
KIRSTEN CINEMA WAS MUCH MORE 
LEFTY, BEFORE SHE GOT ELECTED 
TO THE STATE LADIES AND 
GENTLEMENALATE -- LEGISLATURE, 
AND EVENTUALLY TO CONGRESS, 
WHERE SHE HAS CALIBRATED 
HERSELF INTO A MUCH MORE 
CALIBRATED PROFILE. 
NOW, SHE'S BEEN RUNNING ADS, 
TRYING TO INOCALATE -- 
INOCALATE HERSELF AGAINST THIS 
-- SHE WAS ANTICIPATING THIS 
LINE OF ATTACK, RIGHT FROM THE 
GET-GO I THINK THESE ARE VERY 
SMART, SAVVY WOMEN. 
THIS IS DEGREE TO BE A -- THIS 
IS GOING TO BE A BARN BURNER. 
>> OF COURSE, THIS HAPPENS IN 
THE SHADOW OF SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN'S PASSING. 
WHAT HAVE WE SEEN FROM THE 
CANDIDATES IN THE RACES? 
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING 
ELEMENT. 
BECAUSE JOHN McCAIN, OF COURSE, 
WAS FEUDING WITH DONALD TRUMP. 
SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN VERY MUCH 
OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES 
SEEKING HIS ENDORSEMENT. 
ILLNESS, OBVIOUSLY PLAYS A ROLE 
IN THAT. 
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. 
KELLI WARD IS RUNNING AGAINST 
MARTHA McSALLY. 
ACCUSING THE McCAIN FAMILY OF 
ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WERE GOING 
TO STOP MEDICAL TREATMENT TO 
SIDELINE THE CAMPAIGN AND TO 
TRY TO MAKE HER LOOK BAD, WHICH 
IS KIND OF A CRAZY THING TO 
SAY. 
BUT MARTHA McSALLY IS SNOT 
TRYING TO SAY MUCH ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN, WHO WAS ONE OF HER BIG 
SUPPORTERS DURING HER CAMPAIGN 
RUN. 
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING, THE 
MUTED ASPECT OF McCAIN SUPPORT. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED IN 
ARIZONA. 
WE HAVE EARLY VOTING. 
AND AS A RESULT, YOU KNOW, 70% 
OF THE PEOPLE CAST A BALLOT 
BEFORE ELECTION DAY. 
I SUSPECT HIS PASSING IS NOT 
GOING TO OF TOO MUCH OF AN 
EFFECT ON WHAT IS GOING ON 
TODAY IN ELECTIONS. 
>> ALL RIGHT, JIM NITZEL. 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
INSIGHT. 
>> OH, IT'S A PLEASURE. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BE 
QUICK -- TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
MUCH MORE PRIMARY AHEAD, AS WE 
HOPE TO START GETTING MORE 
RESULTS FROM ARIZONA. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> HI, EVERYONE. 
I'M ELAINE QUIJANO. 
WELCOME TO CBSN'S CONTINUING 
COVERAGE OF THE FLORIDA AND 
ARIZONA PRIMARIES. 
POLLS ARE CLOSED IN BOTH 
STATES. 
AND SOME RACES HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN CALLED. 
THIS IS THE LAST BIG PRIMARY 
DAY BEFORE THE CRITICAL 
NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. 
TONIGHT'S RESULTS ARE 
DETERMINING MIDTERM MATCHUPS 
FOR GOVERNOR, SENATE, AND THE 
HOUSE. 
IN ARIZONA, THE STATE'S 
REPUBLICAN SENATE RACE HAS 
RECEIVED ENORMOUS ATTENTION. 
IT FEATURES THREE CANDIDATES  
WHO HAVE VIED FOR THE 
PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT, BUT 
HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. 
THEY ARE RUNNING TO REPLACE GOP 
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE, WHO IS 
RETIRING. 
THE RACES IN ARIZONA ARE 
HAPPENING IN THE SHADOW OF 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S PASSING. 
THE LONG-TIME ARIZONA 
REPUBLICAN SEAT IS NOT UP FOR 
GRABS TONIGHT, BUT HIS DEATH 
HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE 
FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
>>> AND IN FLORIDA, WE ARE 
SEEING THE FIRST UPSET OF THE 
NIGHT, WHERE ANDREW GILLUM HAS 
WON THE DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR 
GOVERNOR. 
HE WAS BACKED BY SENATOR BERNIE 
SAND SANDERS AND NOW AIMS TO BE 
THE FIRST BLACK GOVERNOR IN 
FLORIDA'S HISTORY. 
GILLUM WILL NOW FACE 
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS, WHO 
DEFEATED ANDREW PUTNAM IN THE 
PRIMARY RACE. 
MR. TRUMP BACKED CONGRESSMAN 
DESANTIS AND EARLIER 
CONGRATULATED HIM ON TWITTER, 
ALLING -- CALLING IT A 
FNTASTIC WIN. 
>>> MEANWHILE, IN THE SENATE 
RACE, REPUBLICAN RICK SCOTT HAS 
WON HIS PRIMARY, WHICH MEANS 
HE'LL FACE OFF AGAINST 
INCUMBENT BILL NELSON. 
WE HAVE A POWERHOUSE PANEL TO 
HELP COVER EVERY ASPECT OF 
TONIGHT'S RACES. 
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS A CBSN 
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR. 
ANT WAN -- ANT JUAN SEAWRIGHT. 
AND LESLIE IS A POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT AND STRATEGIST. 
>> I HAVE TO GO BACK TO 
FLORIDA, ANT JUAN. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FOLKS 
WERE NOT EXPECTING NECESSARILY 
TO HAPPEN. 
THE ATTENTION, WE HEARD IT FROM 
LARRY SAB ATO -- SABATO EARLY 
NER THE EVENING. 
THAT -- EARLIER IN THE EVENING. 
THAT THE DEMOCRATS HE TALKED 
TO, THOUGHT ANOTHER CANDIDATE, 
GWEN GRAHAM WAS GOING TO BE THE 
ONE TO RUN IN THE GENERAL. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 
>> WELL, IT'S A HISTORIC NIGHT. 
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA, THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE 
IS AFRICAN AMERICAN. 
AND HE IS POSITIONED, IF ALL 
GOES WELL, TO BE THE FIRST 
AFRICAN AMERICAN GOVERNOR OF 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
SO IT'S A HISTORIC NIGHT. 
THE SECOND THING I WILL TELL 
YOU IS THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DID 
NOT THINK TONIGHT WAS POSSIBLE 
WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT 
PAYING ATTENTION. 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THE 
CAMPAIGNS MATCHED UP, FROM A 
PURE TACTICAL STANDPOINT, AND 
WHAT WAS DONE, I MENTIONED 
EARLIER, GILLUM'S TEAM DID A 
GREAT JOB OF HAVING A CAMPAIGN 
THAT WAS NOT ONLY HIGH TECH, 
LIKE TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNS ARE, 
IN 2018. 
BUT IT WAS A COMBINATION OF 
HIGH TECH AND HIGH TOUCH. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE BREAD AND 
BUTTER ISSUES, THE ISSUES WE 
HEAR AT BARBER SHOPS AND BEAUTY 
SALONS AND NAIL SHOPS. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT QUALITY OF 
LIFE THINGS. 
AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE 
THAT I THINK WOULD IMPACT 
FUTURE FLORIDA GENERATIONS. 
AND I THINK THAT MADE ALL OF 
THE DIFFERENCE. 
NOW, POLITICS, LIKE LIFE, IS A 
GAME OF MATCHUPS. 
AND I'M A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEVER 
THAT POLITICS, LIKE LIFE, IS 
ABOUT ADDITION AND MULTIPLISKS, 
NOT -- MULTIPLICATION, NOT 
SUBTRACTION OR DIVISION. 
AND THAT IS WHAT POSITIONS 
ANDREW GILLUM TO WIN IN 
NOVEMBER. 
AND BRING ALONG PEOPLE WITH 
HIM. 
LIKE CONVINCE FLORIDA VOTE BILL 
NELSON SHOULD BE REELECTED AS 
SENATOR. 
>> LESLIE, THOUGH, THE CONTRAST 
BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES, 
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS, 
ENDORSED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
WHO ACTUALLY, BEFORE THE 
PRESIDENT'S TWEET, BACK IN 
JUNE, WAS BEHIND IN THE POLLS. 
THEN AFTER THE PRESIDENT 
TWEETED ABOUT HIM, GOT A HUGE 
BUMP. 
AND THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME 
TO TAMPA FOR A CAMPAIGN RALLY 
THERE. 
AND NOW HE'S EMERGED, THE 
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. 
HOW STARK IS THAT CONTRAS? 
AND YOU HEARD WHAT ANT JUAN 
JUST SPELLED OUT THERE, IN 
TERMS OF THE APPEAL THERE. 
OF ANDREW GILLUM. 
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY HERE FOR 
REPUBLICANS? 
>> DEFINITELY, THE PARTY AND 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO SAY 
THE PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT 
MATTERS. 
IT GENERATED A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT. 
MEDIA DOLLARS. 
AND GALVANIZED THE BASE TO COME 
OUT AND SUPPORT DURING THE 
PRIMARY. 
BUT ONE THING TO CONSIDER. 
IT WAS A VERY REPUBLICAN 
PRIMARY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. 
AND IT'S BEEN RAISED SEVERAL 
TIMES THAT ALL OF THOSE 
NEGATIVE ADS AND ALL OF THOSE 
DOLLARS AND ALL OF THOSE LIVE 
BALLS HAVEN'T BEEN TARGETED AT 
THESE TWO, TO THE LEVEL THAT 
WE'LL SEE COMING IN NOVEMBER. 
EVERYTHING FROM FBI 
INVESTIGATIONS TO YOU KNOW, 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN 
TERMS OF IMMIGRATION AND HOW 
LONG STEP ARE YOU GOING TO BE 
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT 
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO GRAPPLE WITH AND DECIDE WHO 
IS THE FAIREST REPRESENTATION 
OF THEIR STATE. 
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE 
AN EASY CALL TO MAKE TODAY. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE 
ELECTORRALITY. 
AND THE -- ELECTORATE. 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A 
TRANSIENT POPULATION AND 
YOUNGER POPULATION. 
AND THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS TEND 
TO BE INDEPENDENT. 
>> THERE'S YOUNGER VOTERS IN 
FLORIDA. 
BUT A LOT OF OLDER VOTERS, TOO. 
I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE 
TESTED IN FLORIDA AND 
EVERYWHERE ELSE, IS THE 
TRADITIONAL MIDTERM TURNOUT 
MODEL. 
UPON MIGHT GET TURNED ON ITS 
HEAD, IF DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO 
SHOW UP IN THE NUMBERS THAT 
THEY'VE SHOWN UP IN THE 
PRIMARIES. 
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S LOOKING 
LIKE. 
BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEING MORE. 
AND I'VE TALKED TO VOTERS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS, PEOPLE WHO 
ARE VOTE FOR EXAMPLE DEMOCRATS 
WHO SAY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T 
NORMALLY SHOW UP IN A 
CONGRESSIONAL YEAR. 
I ONLY FOCUS ON THE PRESIDENCY. 
AND AGAIN, THEY'RE TELLING US 
THIS. 
WE'RE NOT PROMPTING THEM. 
AND THEY ADMIT, I'VE GOT TO DO 
MORE. 
SO I'M SHOWING UP THIS YEAR. 
KNOCKING ON DOORS, DONATING 
MONEY. 
SOME ARE EVEN RUNNING FOR 
OFFICE, UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT. 
AND I THINK IF THAT CONTINUES, 
AND IF WE SEE THAT INTENSITY 
PREVAIL, THROUGH NOVEMBER. 
IT'S GOING TO TURN WHAT WE'VE 
THOUGHT ABOUT MIDTERM ELECTIONS 
ON ITS HEAD. 
AND THAT MAY BE JUST ENOUGH FOR 
DEMOCRATS TO WIN NARROWLY IN 
SOME RACES. 
AND BY BIG MARGINS IN OTHERS. 
>> LET'S BRING IN ANTHONY 
SALVANTO, WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING 
AT THE MAP THERE. 
ANTHONY, TELL US ABOUT FLORIDA. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE? 
>> WELL, AS IF ON CUE, ED TEED 
THIS UP. 
HERE'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
NOT ALWAYS BY NEWS THERE. 
BUT TURNOUT IS ONE OF THE 
THINGS EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE 
LOOKING FOR. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO READ THE TEA 
LEAVES OF PRIMARIES TO SEE IF 
THAT PORTENDS SOMETHING GOING 
FORWARD. 
THE TURNOUT HERE ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, IN THE 
GOVERNOR'S PRIMARY, IS 
APPROACHING, AS THESE VOTE 
COMES IN, WHAT WE SAW IN THE 
2016 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. 
IT'S UP OVER 80% NOW. 
IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND 86%, 
87%, I THINK, WHEN ALL IS SAID 
AND DONE. 
MAYBE MORE. 
AND YOU KNOW, THAT WAS HELPED. 
WE BROKE THIS DOWN A LITTLE BIT 
EARLIER. 
BY THE TURNOUT IN THE URBAN 
AREAS IN THE CITIES. 
YOU GO AROUND ORANGE COUNTY. 
THAT'S AROUND ORLANDO. 
AROUND MIAMI-DADE, AROUND 
BROWARD, ET CETERA. 
PLACES WHERE ANDREW GILLUM DID 
WELL. 
BUT IF YOU -- I THINK THE KEY 
QUESTION GOING FORWARD IS, 
THESE ARE FOLKS, LIKE ED 
DESCRIBED, PERHAPS, WHO VOTE IN 
PRESIDENTIAL YEARS, BUT DON'T 
ALWAYS SHOW UP IN MIDTERMS. 
IF THEY'RE NOW VOTING IN A 
PRIMARY, WELL, A POLLSTER IS 
GOING TO LOOK AT THAT AND GOING 
TO SAY, OKAY. 
THAT IS PROBABLY A LIKELY 
VOTER, COME NOVEMBER. 
THEN THE QUESTION IS GOING TO 
BE, IS THERE ANOTHER LEVEL OF 
VOTER, COME NOVEMBER, WHO 
HASN'T BEEN IN THESE PRIMARIES, 
WHO WILL COME OUT. 
AND THAT WOULD TAKE TURNOUT 
EVEN HIGHER. 
BUT I SHOULDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT 
THE DEMOCRATS HERE. 
WE'VE ALSO GOT TO LOOK AT THE 
REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE THEIR TURN 
TURNOUT HERE IS NO SLOUCH 
EITHER. 
YOU KNOW, RICK SCOTT WON 
EASILY. 
BUT ONCE YOU GET UP OVER 1.5 
MILLION VOTES, NOW HERE YOU'RE 
TALKING APPROACHING ALMOST 70% 
OF THE TURNOUT IN THE 2016 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL 
PRIMARY. 
AND THAT, OF COURSE, WAS A 
REALLY CONTESTED, REALLY HOT 
RACE. 
SO REPUBLICANS ARE TURNING OUT 
HERE, TOO. 
AND I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. 
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO 
BE ONE OF THOSE BATTLES, AS WE 
HEAD TOWARDS NOVEMBER. 
NOT REALLY EVEN SO MUCH FOR THE 
MIDDLE. 
BUT BOTH PARTIES, SAYING, OKAY. 
YOU CAME OUT IN 2016. 
YOU'VE GOT TO COME OUT IN THIS 
CONGRESSIONAL. 
>> SO ANTHONY, WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING THERE IS, WHILE TURNOUT 
IS IMPRESSIVE, PERCENTAGE, 
COMPARED TO 2016, WE SHOULD 
RIMIND VOTERS -- REMIND VOTERS, 
THERE ARE STILL MORE 
REPUBLICANS VOTING IN THEIR 
PRAY MARRY TODAY, OR THAT HAVE 
VOTED THROUGHENTIAL VOTING AND 
TODAY -- THROUGH EARLY VOTING 
AND TODAY, THAN DEMOCRATS. 
IT'S THE PERCENTAGE THAT SHOWED 
UP IT, IF THEY'RE A REGISTERED 
DEMOCRAT, IS HIGHER, WHICH IS 
WHAT POTENTIALLY REMAKES THE 
MODELS OF TURNOUT ON BOTH 
SIDES. 
>> YEAH. 
I THINK -- YOU KNOW, YOU WANT 
TO JUST BE CAREFUL WITH THE 
COMPARISONS HERE. 
I USE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL 
PRIMARY, AS ONE, KIND OF 
APPLES, WHAT I WOULD HOPE WOULD 
BE AN APPLES TO APPLES 
COMPARISON. 
WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT 
PAST MIDTERMS, THIS WILL EXCEED 
PAST MIDTERMS. 
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO FACTOR 
IN, WELL, OKAY, IN 2013, WAS 
THERE A COMPETITIVE RACE ON 
EACH SIDE? 
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT DON'T 
NECESSARILY MATCH UP. 
YOU COMPARE NOW TO THEN. 
AND IT'S A FALSE COMPARISON. 
BECAUSE MAYBE THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE, THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, 
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS HOTLY 
CONTESTED ON THAT SIDE BACK 
THEN. 
SO THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY 
HAVE EXPECTED A HIGH TURNOUT. 
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THOSE 
KIND OF APPLES TO ORANGES 
COMPARISONS. 
THAT'S PERHAPS THE ONE THAT I 
MIGHT USE AS BENCHMARK. 
BUT EVEN THEN. 
THESE ARE THINGS WE'RE SETTING
UP AS WAYS TO COMPARE. 
AGAIN, I THINK THAT WHEN WE GET 
TO NOVEMBER. 
I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE A 
LOT OF THESE FOLKS WHO DON'T 
TYPICALLY VOTE IN MIDTERMS. 
REMEMBER, IN A MIDTERM 
ELECTION, YOU MIGHT GET 40% 
TURNOUT. 
YOU KNOW, THAT'S LESS THAN HALF 
OF PEOPLE. 
IF THAT STARTS TO APPROACH 50%, 
WHICH WOULD BE -- WHICH WOULD 
BE REMARKABLE. 
BUT IF IT DOES, THEN WE HAVE A 
VERY DIFFERENT ELECTORATE, ED. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
IMPORTANT CONTEX. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANTHONY. 
>>> LET'S TALK TO ARIZONA. 
ED O'KEEFE. 
YOU TALKED TO VOTERS IN THE 
STATE EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT 
THE REPUBLICAN SENATE RACE. 
LET'S GO AHEAD AND LISTEN TO 
THAT. 
>> WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE RUNNING TO SUCCEED HIM? 
>> WE'VE GOT KRISTEN CINEMA -- 
KRISTEN CINEMA. 
SHE'S -- KYRSTEN SINEMA. 
>> YOU TALKING ABOUT EITHER 
PARTY. 
>> YEAH. 
ALL OF THEM. 
>> OKAY. 
WELL, YOU'VE GOT McSALLY. 
NUMBER 1, I THINK McSALLY OUGHT 
TO STAY IN THE DISTRICT TO SAVE 
THAT SEAT. 
AND SHE HAD ONLY BEEN THERE TWO 
YEARS. 
AND TO RUN FOR A HIGHER OFFICE, 
I DON'T THINK SHE'S QUALIFIED. 
THE -- I GOTTA SAY NAME. 
>> KELLI WARD. 
>> I GOTTA INTERRUPT ANYWAY. 
>> KELLI WARD IS A LONG-TIME 
ARIZONAIAN. 
KNOWS ALL THE ISSUES. 
BEEN THROUGH IT FOR YEARS. 
AND WILL I GIVE CREDIT TO HER 
BEING AN AIR PILOT AND ALL OF 
TASTUFF? 
-- THAT STUFF. 
SINCE I WAS AN INFANTRYMAN, I 
STICK MORE WITH THE INFANTRYMEN 
THAN AIR FORCE GUYS. 
>> I LOVE HEARING FROM VOTERS. 
WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY? 
>> THEY DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT 
THE PEOPLE RUNNING TO REPLACE 
JEFF FLAKE. 
THEY MAYBE HEARD THE NAME. 
BUT UNDERSTANDABLE. 
BECAUSE WE TALKED TO THEM IN 
JULY. 
THAT THEY HADN'T HADN'T FORMED 
ON WHO WAS RUNNING. 
WE CAN SEE NOW. 
WE'RE AN HOUR AND 13 MINUTES 
AFTER THE POLL CLOSED, THEY'VE 
DECIDED TO CLOSE THE RESULTS. 
AND MARKETTA McSAL -- MARTHA 
McSALLY, AS AMOUNTED, IS THE 
LEAD. 
>> YOU KNOW, THE TALK HAD BEEN 
THE APPEAL ABOUT KELLI WARD AND 
JOE ARPAIO, OBVIOUSLY TO THOSE 
IN THE FAR RIGHT OF THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
>> EXTREME RIGHT. 
>> AND HAVING THIS EFFECT OF 
SPLITTING THAT FAR RIGHT VOTE. 
IS THAT POTENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE 
BEGINNING TO SEE HERE, AS YOU 
SEE MARTHA McSALLY, ENJOYING 
THIS LEAD AT THIS POINT. 
OBVIOUSLY, VERY EARLY YET. 
BUT STILL, HOW MUCH OF A 
CONCERN WAS THAT? 
>> TALKING TO FOLKS ON THE 
GROUND, THEY REALLY FELT THAT 
WARD AND ARPAIO, OBVIOUSLY, 
WERE VERY SENSATIONAL 
CANDIDATES. 
THAT WERE ATTRACTED TO THE 
LIMELIGHT. 
AND REALLY WERE HOPING THAT THE 
TRUMP EFFECT WOULD BE MUCH MORE 
SIGNIFICANT IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS. 
BUT THAT McSALLY WAS A MUCH 
MORE TRIED-AND-TRUE, PROVEN 
LEADER. 
AND SHE DOES FALL IN THAT 
ESTABLISHMENT CAMP. 
BUT THEY FELT A LOT MORE SECURE 
ABOUT HER. 
AND THEY FELT SHE COULD RAISE 
MONEY, BE COMPETITIVE, AND 
SHE'S IN THE MODEL OF WHAT 
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF 
ARIZONA LEADERSHIP. 
THE STRONG MILITARY SIDE. 
PRO BUSINESS SIDE. 
KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING. 
AND CAN HAVE A STRONG STAND ON 
IMMIGRATION, WHICH IT'S NOT ONE 
OF THE ISSUES SHE RAISED. 
BUT THEY DO FEEL THAT SHE WOULD 
FALL IN LINE WITH, YOU KNOW, 
ENFORCING THE BORDER, NATIONAL 
SECURITY PERSPECTIVE. 
SHE WAS VERY APPEALING ALL THE 
WAY AROUND. 
>> THE FACT THAT ALL THREE HAD 
TO ESSENTIALLY RUN TO EMBRACE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, EFFECTIVELY 
CANCEL OUT THAT ASPECT? 
>> WELL, THEIR EMBRACE WAS VERY 
DIFFERENT. 
IT WAS LIKE FROM VERY FAR AWAY. 
I'M WAVING FROM A WINDOW. 
ANOTHER WAS LIKE FROM A BEAR 
HUG. 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE 
PARDONED, IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH 
APPEAL THAT HAS. 
JOE ARPAIO, YES. 
AND SALLY WAS THE TRIED AND 
TRUE ESTABLISHMENT, THAT GAVE 
THE MOST CONFIDENCE TO PARTY 
LEADERS AND TO REPUBLICAN-BASED 
VOTERS THERE. 
>> MITCH McCONNELL HAS SAID, 
THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN HOLD THAT 
SEAT FOR US IS MARTHA McSALLY. 
>> BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE 
SEEN IN PRIOR ELECTIONS, IF YOU 
GO TO EXTREME, IT'S NOT A 
VIABLE CANDIDATE THAT CAN WIN 
IN GENERAL. 
>> AND WE SHOULD MENTION, TWO 
YEARS AGO, KELLI WARD RAN 
AGAINST JOHN McCAIN. 
ULTIMATELY ONLY GOT 16%. 
BUT WAS MAKING THE POINT, HER 
WORDS, NOT OURS, THAT SHE 
DIDN'T THINK HE WAS HEALTHY 
ENOUGH TO RUN AGAIN, THAT HE 
SHOULD STEP ASIDE. 
AND SHE RAN AGAINST JEFF FLAKE, 
MAKING THE ARGUMENT HE IS 
INSUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE. 
BUT DREW A LOT OF NOTORIETY 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR 
BASICALLY CRITIQUING SENATOR 
McCAIN'S AGE AND WHETHER OR NOT 
HE WAS FIT FOR THE JOB. 
>> AND SHE DID FORCE HIM TO DO 
ADDITIONAL POLLING, GO OUT AND 
REACH TO HIS FAN OF 
CONSERVATIVES, BROADEN THE BASE 
OF SUPPORT. 
AND REALLY DIG DOWN INTO THE 
DATA TO MAKE SURE THEY COULD 
GET THE TURNOUT MODEL RIGHT. 
SO IT DID HEIGHTEN THE 
AWARENESS THAT THIS WAVE, THIS 
TRUMP EFFECT COULD BE VERY 
SIGNIFICANT, EVEN FOR McCAIN. 
>>> THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT 
TRUMP'S EFFECT IN THESE 
PRIMARIES. 
I MEAN, LET'S NOT FORGET, TRUMP 
COULD NOT SURVIVE ELECTION. 
IF HE WERE A CRITIC OF DONALD 
TRUMP. 
AND WE TALKED ABOUT MARTHA 
McSALLY AS AN ESTABLISHED 
CANDIDATE. 
AND SHE IS. 
BUT SHE HAD TO BACK AWAY FROM 
HER SUPPORT OF DREAM 
LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE. 
HER FIRST AD, WAS TALKING ABOUT 
NOT TAKING THE POLITICALLY 
CORRECT STANCE. 
AND CALLING OUT LAWMAKERS AND 
CONGRESS. 
VERY MUCH RUNNING IN THAT WAY. 
AND WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE, TOO, 
THAT ARIZONA WILL MAKE HISTORY, 
NO MATTER WHAT, IN NOVEMBER. 
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER HAD A WOMAN 
REPRESENTING THE STATE AND THE 
SENATE. 
SO ASSUMING ARPAIO DOESN'T WIN, 
McSALLY AND SINEMA WILL BE 
QUITE A MATCHUP. 
>> THE CHALLENGE FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS IS THE SAME 
CHALLENGE FOR THE REPUBLICANS 
IN FLORIDA. 
THE PRIMARY IN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY IS SOMEWHERE ON PLUTO. 
SO IT'S THE FIGHT TO GET TO 
PLUTO. 
SO NOW, HAVE YOU TO TRY TO 
FIGHT TO GET BACK TO THE 
MIDDLE. 
AND ALSO, CONVINCE THESE PEOPLE 
IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AND 
THESE NORMAL VOTERS, NORMAL 
REPUBLICAN, TRADITIONAL 
REPUBLICAN VOTERS, TO VOTE FOR 
YOU AT THE SAME TIME. 
--  
>> YEAH. 
>> BY THE WAY, ANTJUAN. 
HE'S A DEMOCRAT, CAN YOU TELL. 
>> I MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT T. 
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE THE 
CHALLENGE FOR REPUBLICAN VOTERS 
AND ARIZONANS AND FLORIDA. 
THE QUESTION WILL BE, WILL 
MODERATE REPUBLICANS SAY, 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WE'RE GOING TO 
HOP ON THIS TRAIN AND RIDE WITH 
OUR CANDIDATE? 
AND WILL THE EXTREME 
REPUBLICANS DO THE SAME? 
OR WILL THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 
THE SAME PROBLEM THEY HAD IN 
2016, WHERE YOU HAVE THE FAR 
WING OR THE PARTY WHO WILL SAY, 
WE'LL DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. 
WE'LL RUN A THIRD PARTY 
CANDIDATE, WE'LL GO SOMEWHERE 
ELSE, AND SIT IT OUT. 
IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT GIVES THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO 
MAKE HISTORY IN ARIZONA AND 
BALK INTO A -- WALK INTO A U.S. 
SENATE SEAT. 
>> REMEMBER, JEFF FLAKE OPTED 
NOT TO RUN PRIMARILY, AND IN 
THE SHOARM TERM BECAUSE HE 
FIGURED HE COULDN'T WIN 
TONIGHT. 
BUT THERE WAS ALSO POLLING 
SHOWING HIM LOSING TO KYRSTEN 
SINEMA THAT THE STATE'S GENERAL 
ELECTION REALITY WAS SUCH THAT 
A MODERATE DEMOCRATIC WOMAN 
FROM THE PHOENIX AREA, HAD A 
BETTER SHOT AT HOLDING A SEAT 
THAN JEFF FLAKE WHO WAS A ONE-
TERM SENATOR. 
>> IT GOES BACK TO WHAT I SAID 
EARLIER. 
MATCHUPS. 
POLLICK ITS IS A GAME OF 
MATCHUPS WHOVMENTD IS ON THE 
FIELD AT THE SAME TIME, AND HOW 
DOES THAT PLAY OUT? 
>> NATIONAL DEMOCRATS LOOKED AT 
HER RECORD AND SAID, AT THIS 
TIME, COULD PREVEAL. 
-- PREVAIL. 
>> AND AGAIN, PREVAIL, BUT 
APPLES TO APPLES IN TERMS OF 
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. 
THOSE TWO, VERY HIGHLY 
CONFIDENT WOMEN AGAINST EACH 
OTHER. 
AND DETERMINING WHERE THAT 
FALLS. 
>> WELL, LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT 
SENATOR FLAKE AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAVE SAID ABOUT MOTHER -- 
MARTHA SALLY. 
>> I THINK McSALLY WILL WIN. 
I HOPE SHE DOES. 
THAT'S THE ONLY SHOT THAT 
OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS HAVE TO 
HOLD ONTO THE SEAT. 
BUT IT'S EVEN DIFFICULT THEN. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A HARD-
FOUGHT GENERAL ELECTION. 
>> OKAY. 
NO SOUND FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 
APPARENTLY. 
I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE THAT. 
BUT YOU KNOW, HARD FOUGHT 
ELECTION. 
SO YOU KNOW,ICATE LIN, AS WE 
LOOK AT THAT MATCHUP, AND WHAT 
LESLIE JUST TALKED ABOUT, YOU 
HAVE THESE WOMEN, POTENTIALLY, 
WHO ARE GOING TO BE FACING EACH 
OTHER IN THE GENERAL. 
WHAT DOES IT THAT MEAN, FOR A 
STATE LIKE ARIZONA? 
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. 
HOW DOES THAT SQUARE UP? 
>> BRINGS AN IMPORTANT POINT 
ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION AND 
INSECURITIES THAT THE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT FLAKE. 
SECOND OF ALL, THERE IS THIS 
FEELING, TOO, THAT WHILE YOU 
HAVE TO KIND OF APPEAL TO A 
CHANGING ELECTORATE, YOU ALSO 
HAVE TO REALLY DRIVE UP YOUR 
BASE AND JEFF FLAKE WAS NOT 
LIKED BY HIS BASE. 
McSALLY DOES HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY HERE. 
AND REPUBLICANS CERTAINLY THINK 
SHE HAS THE BEST ONE. 
AND SHE CAN REALLY PLAY TO WHAT 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE, 
HER OWN BIOGRAPHY. 
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT 
TONIGHT, TOO. 
WE HEARD THIS FROM GILLUM, KIND 
OF THIS FREE AIR CAMPAIGN 
TONIGHT, WHEN THEY CAN MAKE 
THEIR VICTORY SPEECHES AND 
INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO THAT 
GENERAL ELECTORATE. 
IT GIVES THEM THE CHANCE TO 
CREATE THEIR OWN BIOGRAPHICAL 
SPOTS, REALLY. 
AND TRY TO PLAY THAT UP. 
AND I THINK WE'LL SEE A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS DOING THAT. 
HOWEVER, ARIZONA IS A BORDER 
STATE. 
WE SAW McSALLY ALSO RELEASE 
ADS. 
ONE AD, ABOUT BEING TOUGH ON 
THE BORDER. 
SHE DIDN'T USE THE RHETORIC 
THAT DONALD TRUMP USES. 
BUT STILL, IT'S AN ELEMENT WE 
SAW IN THAT McCAIN AD, A FEW 
YEARS AGO, SAYING, BUILD THE 
DANG FENCE. 
IT'S STILL VERY MUCH, PICKING 
UP ON WHAT LARRY SABATO SAID. 
AN ISSUE AT LEAST AMONG 
REPUBLICANS. 
>> AND WE DO HAVE THAT SOUND 
NOW, FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
MARTHA McSALLY, LET'S LISTEN TO 
THAT. 
>> THERE'S ANOTHER MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS HERE TODAY, WHO IS NOT 
ONLY AN AIR FORCE VETERAN, BUT 
THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO FLY A 
FIGHTER JET IN COMBAT IN U.S. 
HISTORY. 
AND I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER 
VERY WELL. 
AND SHE IS TERRIFIC. 
CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA McSALLY. 
CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU, 
MARTHA. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
>> SO IT'S INTERESTING, LESLIE. 
YOU HEARD HIM THERE. 
AND THAT WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO, 
RIGHT? 
THAT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
AGO. 
AND YET, NO ACTUAL ENGORSMENT. 
-- ENDORSEMENT. 
>> NOT AN ENDORSEMENT. 
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS 
AGGRESSIVELY GOING FOR THAT 
ENDORSEMENT. 
BUT I THINK THERE IS ALSO THE 
DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY 
SINCE THE PASSING OF SENATOR 
McCAIN AND THIS RIFT THAT 
CONTINUOUS -- CONTINUES WITH 
THE PRESIDENT AND THE DUE 
RESPECT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN. 
HER FOCUS NOW, LOOKING AT THE 
STATE, AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT 
IS PROBABLY -- IT BEHOOVES HER, 
CERTAINLY POLITICALLY. 
>> THERE WERE SOME REPORTING 
TODAY FROM HER FRIENDS AT THE 
NEW YORK TIMES, SAYING THE 
McSALLY CAMPAIGN HAD GONE TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SAID, DO 
US A FAVOR, AND SIT THIS ONE 
OUT. 
AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW AND WE 
KNOW WE'RE THE BEST SHOT AT 
HOLDING THIS SEAT. 
BUT THEN IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, 
APPARENTLY THEY SAID, HOW ABOUT 
YOU ENDORSE US NOW? 
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID NO. 
AND PART OF THE REASON THEY 
FIGURED SHE WAS ASKING FOR IT 
IS SHE ACTUALLY WANTED TO SAVE 
SOME MONEY, SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE 
TO KEEP RUNNING ADS AGAINST 
KELLI WARD AND JOE ARPAIO, AND 
WOULD BE ABLE TO BANK IT AWAY, 
TO RUN AGAINST KIRSTEN CINEMA. 
KIRSTEN CINEMA. 
-- KYRSTEN SINEMA. 
THAT NIGHT WAS THE NIGHT HE -- 
THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD ENDORSE 
SOMEBODY. 
HE DIDN'T DO IT. 
HE MET WITH KELLI WARD. 
MET WITH SALMON, A BUNCH OF 
OTHERSES BACKSTAGE. 
BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. 
>> AND REMEMBER THAT KYRSTEN 
SINEMA DIDN'T HAVE A PRIMARY 
OPPONENT. 
SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO RUN THIS 
ENTIRE TIME, GEARING UP TOWARD 
THE GENERAL ELECTION. 
THIS WAS ALWAYS A CONCERN WITH 
REPUBLICANS THAT THE PRIMARY, 
AT THE END OF AUGUST HERE, 
WOULD BE KIND OF LONG AND 
DRAGGED OUT. 
AND WHILE SINEMA, COULD RUN 
ESSENTIALLY UNOPPOSED. 
>> THEY ARE TELLING US WE NEED 
TO TAKE A BREAK. 
MUCH MORE ELECTION COVERAGE 
AHEAD. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> HELLO, I'M BILL WHITAKER, 
WITH "60 MINUTES." 
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 
CONGRESSMAN MORENO. 
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY WHAT IS 
OUT OF CONTROL. 
IF WE DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 
PEOPLE DIE. 
>> WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN 
ABOUT THIS WITHOUT 60 MINUTES. 
>> I DID LOOK INTO THE REPORT. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY 
SERIOUSLY. 
>> THEY'RE JUST DRUG DEALERS IN 
LAB COATS. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 
PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 
>>> HE TAUGHT ME THAT HONOR AND 
IMPERFECT PERFECTION ARE ALWAYS 
IN COMPETITION. 
I DO NOT CRY FOR A PERFECT MAN. 
I CRY FOR A MAN WHO HAD HONOR 
AND ALWAYS WAS WILLING TO ADMIT 
TO HIS IMPERFECTION. 
>> THAT WAS SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM, PRAISING HIS FRIEND, 
THE LATE SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. 
McCAIN'S SEAT WILL BE PICKED BY 
GOVERNOR DOUG DOUG DUCEY. 
AND JOINING ME NOW IS NICK 
CARTER. 
NICK, LET'S TALK ABOUT ARIZONA 
GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY, UP FOR RE-
ELECTION. 
NOW HE'S GOT TO PICK A 
REPLACEMENT FOR SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN'S SEAT. 
YOU CALLED THIS A POLITICAL 
BALANCING ACT. 
HOW DOES THIS APPOINTMENT 
COMPLICATE DUCEY'S OWN RE-
ELECTION BID? 
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY 
CONSIENTIAL -- CONSEQUENTIAL 
ELECTION. 
HE SAID THERE SHOULDN'T BE 
ANYTHING UNTIL McCAIN'S BURIAL, 
WHICH IS GOING TO BE ON SUNDAY. 
GOVERNOR DUCEY FACES NOMINAL 
OPPOSITION FROM HIS RIGHT IN 
THE PRIMARY. 
HIS MAIN WORRY WILL BE THE 
GENERAL ELECTION. 
AND HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO, AS 
I SAID, IN THE REFERENCE, HE'S 
GOING TO HAVE TO BALANCE A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS. 
THE McCAIN FAMILY AND THEIR 
DESIRES IS GOING TO BE ONE OF 
THEM AND A VERY STRONG ONE. 
THE GOVERNOR HAS GOTTEN A LOT 
OF PRAISE, FROM PEOPLE CLOSE TO 
THE LATE SENATOR FOR KEEPING A 
LID ON SPECULATION. 
THERE HAS BEEN A NOTABLE LACK 
OF LEAKS. 
THERE HAS BEEN THE IMPRESSION 
AMONG A LOT OF POLITICAL 
PLAYERS, THAT HE IS NOT TALKING 
TO THE CANDIDATES. 
HE EVEN SAID THAT IF ANY OF THE 
CANDIDATES REACHED OUT TO HIM, 
WHILE JOHN McCAIN WAS STILL 
ALIVE, THEY'D PROBABLY 
DISQUALIFY THEMSELVES. 
AND THAT'S LED TO ESSENTIALLY 
PEOPLE CREATING HANDICAP LISTS, 
BUT HIM NOT TIPPING HIS HAND AT 
ALL. 
SO HE'S GOT TO BALANCE THE 
FAMILY'S WISHES. 
HE'S GOT TO BALANCE THE 
POLITICAL REALITIES OF ARIZONA 
STATE, WHERE THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY IS FAIRLY DIVIDED, WE'RE 
SEEING THAT IN THE PRIMARY 
RIGHT NOW. 
THERE IS A FACTION THAT THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S PROBABLY 
A SIZABLE MINORITY THAT STILL 
DISLIKES AND IS ANGRY AT 
SENATOR McCAIN. 
VERY STRONGLY ANGRY AT HIM. 
NATIONALLY, POLLS GENERALLY 
SHOW, HE'S MORE FAVORABLY 
LOOKED UPON BY THE DEMOCRATS 
THAN REPUBLICANS. 
AND WHAT THE FAMILY WANTS MAY 
NOT BE WHAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS. 
AND GOVERNOR DUCEY WILL NEED 
THEIR LOYALTY TO WIN RE-
ELECTION. 
HE ALSO HAS TO THINK ABOUT, 
DOES HE APPOINT A CARETAKER, 
WHO WILL STEP ASIDE AND LET 
OTHER PEOPLE COMPETE FOR THE 
SEAT IN 2020, WHEN THE NEXT 
ELECTION IS SCHEDULED FOR IT? 
OR DOES HE APPOINT A STRONG 
CANDIDATE FOR 2020? 
IN DOING THAT, THAT'S TWO 
OTHERS. 
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE 
FAMILY'S WISHES, VERSUS THE 
NEEDS IN WASHINGTON. 
IT'S A NARROWLY DEVOIDED 
SENATE. 
YOU -- DIVIDED SENATE. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS A 
RELIABLE VOTE FOR PARTY LEADERS 
IN WASHINGTON. 
AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT ANGERED 
THE BASE HERE. 
IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO IS 
ELECTABLE IN 2020, YOU NEED TO 
MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT 
PRIMARIED. 
LIKE JEFF FLAKE HAD TO STOP 
RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION, 
BECAUSE OF DANGER OF A PRIMARY. 
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE 
TO THE BASE, BUT THAT THEY'RE 
ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN A 
GENERAL ELECTION. 
SO THERE'S A LOT OF COOM 
PEATING -- COMPETING PRESSURES 
ON THE GOVERNOR. 
>> YOU SAID OUT OF RESPECT FOR 
THE McCAIN FAMILY, HE IS NOT 
GOING TO NAME A REPLACEMENT, 
UNTIL THE LATE SENATOR IS LAID 
TO REST. 
BUT ARE THERE NUMBER -- NAMES 
BEING FLOATED? 
>> THERE ARE NUMBERS OF NAMES 
BEING FLOATED. 
ONE THAT IS RECOGNIZED IS THAT 
OF THE SENATOR'S WIFE, CINDY 
McCAIN. 
AND OTHER NAMES -- SHE KIND OF 
HAS GOTTEN THE MOST ATTENTION. 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT THE MOST -- 
YOU KNOW, THE BEST-KNOWN NAME. 
THERE'S THE FAMILY CONNECTION. 
IT IS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR WIDOWS 
TO BE APPOINTED THROUGHOUT THE 
REMAINDER OF THEIR LATE 
HUSBAND'S SENATE SEATS. 
BUT SHE WOULD PROBABLY COME 
WITH SOME POTENTIAL, YOU KNOW, 
POTENTIAL BAGGAGE, THE LAST 
NAME ALONE, MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO 
INCITE SOME MEMBERS OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE BASE. 
AND OTHER NAMES ARE SENATOR JON 
KYL, FORMER SENATOR JON KYL. 
HE IS, OF COURSE, THE -- AS 
THEY CALL IT IN WASHINGTON, THE 
SHERPA FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
SO HE'S NOW TRYING TO MARSHALL 
THAT THROUGH THE SENATE. 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A RATHER BUSY 
DAY JOB. 
BUT HIS NAME DOES CIRCULATE 
FREQUENTLY. 
HE'LL BE SPEAKING AT SENATOR 
McCAIN'S SERVICE TOMORROW. 
AND JOHN SHADEC. 
AND MATT SALMON, TWO REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESSMEN FROM ARIZONA. 
EILEEN KLEIN IS THE STATE 
TREASURER. 
AND SHE IS -- HER NAME COMES UP 
AS WELL, AS THE SORT OF 
CANDIDATE WHO WOULD BE MORE -- 
SOMEBODY WHO COULD RUN IN 2020. 
KAREN ROBIS SON IS ALSO A 
DEVELOPER WHO COMES UP 
OCCASIONALLY. 
THIS HAS BEEN SPECULATION. 
THERE HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN MANY 
HINTS OR TIPS OUT HERE. 
>> REPUBLICANS HOLD ONLY A 
SLIGHT MAJORITY. 
WHAT ARE SOME IMPLICATIONS -- 
>> OBVIOUSLY THE CABINET 
NOMINATION IS NUMBER 1. 
PROBABLY THE MAIN ORDER OF 
BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON THIS 
FALL. 
AND I IMAGINE, MOST REPUBLICANS 
WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHOEVER 
TAKES THE SEAT IS GOING TO BE A 
SOLID YES ON KAVANAUGH. 
OBVIOUSLY, SENATOR McCAIN -- 
SENATOR McCAIN'S MOST FAMOUS 
AND CONSIENTIAL -- 
CONSEQUENTIAL VOTE OF THE LAST 
YEAR WAS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
WHEN HE VOTED THAT DOWN WITH 
HIS FAMOUS AFTER-MIDNIGHT 
THUMBS DOWN. 
AD HIS REPLACEMENT, THERE 
WOULD PROBABLY BE A LOT OF 
PRESSURE TO SOMEBODY WHO WOULD 
BE COMMITTED TO A FOUL REPEAL 
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
THERE'S -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A 
NUMBER -- THOSE ARE PROBABLY 
THE TWO. 
THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT 
YOU COULD PROBABLY POINT TO AS 
POSSIBLE DEFUNDING OF PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD AND THAT. 
BUT KAVANAUGH AND THE ACA ARE 
PROBABLY THE TWO MOST 
CONSEQUENCAL QUESTIONS THAT 
FACE REPUBLICANS, WHERE THEIR 
NARROW MAJORITY IS. 
>> AND WE WANT TO POINT OUT TO 
VOTERS THERE, THE CBS NEWS 
PROTECTION THAT GOVERNOR DUCEY 
HAS WON IN HIS PRIMARY THERE. 
THAT'S NOT UNEXPECTED, NICK. 
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH AMONG THE 
LINES OF WHAT WE HAD THOUGHT 
GOING INTO THIS NIGHT. 
>> YEAH. 
HE -- HE -- HE HAD FAMOUSED A 
RELATIVELY NEGLIGIBLE PRIMARY 
OPPOSITION AND HAS BEEN FAIRLY 
WELL POSITIONED. 
IT WILL WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE HOW HE FAIRS IN THE GENERAL 
ELECTION. 
>> BACK ON THE ISSUE OF FINDING 
A REPLACEMENT FOR SENATOR 
SENATOR McEXAIN'S SEAT -- 
McCAIN'S SEAT. 
DO WE KNOW IF THE GOVERNOR IS 
TAKING INPUT FROM LEADERS IN 
WASHINGTON ON WHO SHOULD FILL 
THIS VACANCY HAD. 
>> IT HAS BEEN PLAYED VERY 
CLOSE TO THE VEST. 
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD 
INSIGHT INTO WHO HE IS TALKING 
TO. 
32 HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE LACK OF 
LEAKS ON THE MATTER. 
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, UNUSUAL. 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- PEOPL WHO 
ARE KIND OF IN THE POLITICAL 
WORLD, THE REPUBLICAN POLITICAL 
OPERATIONS OUT HERE, SAY THAT 
THEY TAKE THE SILENCE TO MEAN 
THAT HE REALLY HASN'T HAD 
CONVERSATIONS WITH ANYBODY. 
AND THAT HE'S STAYING TRUE TO 
WHAT HE SAID. 
THAT HE'S GOING TO WAIT FOR THE 
SENATOR TO BE LAID TO REST, 
BEFORE HE APPROACHES THE ISSUE. 
>> WE WANT TO POINT OUT TO OUR 
VIEWERS, YOU'RE WATCHING LIVE 
IMAGES THERE OF MARTHA McSALLY. 
WE SHOULD TELL YOU OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE, IN FACT, 
CALLED US FOR HER. 
WE HAVE NOT YET HERE AT CBS 
NEWS. 
BUT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ABOUT 
READY TO TAKE TO THE PODIUM. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> WOW. 
 
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
WOW. 
WELL, THANK YOU. 
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. 
I'M HUMBLED AND HONORED TO NOW 
STAND BEFORE YOU FOR THE VERY 
FIRST TIME AS YOUR REPUBLICAN 
NOMINEE FOR THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE. 
 
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S TEMPTING TO 
CELEBRATE. 
BUT LET'S KEEP SOMETHING IN 
MIND. 
THIS IS NOT OUR OBJECTIVE. 
OUR MISSION IS IN 70 DAYS. 
WE HAVE 70 DAYS TO WIN THIS 
SEAT. 
AND CANDIDLY, IT'S DIFFICULT TO 
DIFFICULT TO CELEBRATE ANYTHING 
THIS WEEK, AS WE MOURN THE LOSS 
OF SENATOR McCAIN. 
AND WE PREPARE TO HONOR HIM 
HERE IN ARIZONA AND IN D.C., 
BEFORE HE'S LAID TO REST AT 
ANNAPOLIS. 
SENATOR McCAIN WAS AN AMERICAN 
HERO. 
HE PAID AN UNFATHOMABLE PRICE 
FOR OUR FREEDOM, AND UPON 
RETURNING HOME, CONTINUED TO 
SERVE A CONVICTION, HONOR AND 
SACRIFICE, HIS WHOLE LIFE. 
FROM EARLY DAYS AS A CADET AT 
THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY, WE 
STUDIED HIM, AS AN EXAMPLE OF 
COURAGE, LEADERSHIP, AND HONOR. 
SENATOR McCAIN CAME TO AN EVENT 
FOR ME, WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR 
CONGRESS. 
AND HE TOLD THE CROWD THERE 
THAT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WAS THAT 
MY TAKEOFFS EQUAL MY LANDINGS. 
UNLIKE HIM. 
 
>> AND THAT I SHOOT DOWN 
AIRPLANES AND HE GETS SHOT 
DOWN. 
IN HIS WORDS. 
HERE WAS THIS LARGER-THAN-LIFE 
PATRIOT, JOKING ABOUT BEING 
SHOT DOWN. 
AND TAKING HIS TIME TO SUPPORT 
A FELLOW FIGHTER PILOT, WHO 
FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS. 
I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HAVE 
HAD THE CHANCE TO KNOW HIM, TO 
LEARN FROM HIM, AND TO EACH 
WORK WITH HIM ON SAVING THE A-
10 WARTHOG. 
 AND IN HIS HONOR, 
I'D ASK US NOW, PLEASE, JOIN ME 
IN A MOMENT OF SILENCE IN THE 
MEMORY OF THIS GREAT MAN. 
TONIGHT MARKS THE CHAPTER, THE 
NEXT CHAPTER IN THIS CAMPAIGN. 
THE BEGINNING OF A 70-DAY 
SPRINT, TO ELECTING ARIZONA'S 
NEXT SENATOR. 
PEOPLE ARE VOTING IN JUST 43 
DAYS. 
IT'S A BIG DEAL. 
THIS IS HOW I SEE THIS 
CAMPAIGN. 
IT'S A CHOICE, BETWEEN A DOER 
AND A TALKER. 
BETWEEN A PATRIOT AND A 
PROTESTOR. 
BETWEEN --  
 
>> THANKS. 
IF YOU GUYS LIKE THOSE SIDE-BY-
SIDE OUTFITS? 
 
>> BETWEEN A CAREER FIGHTER 
PILOT AND A CAREER POLITICIAN. 
BETWEEN PROVEN GRIT AND 
HOLLYWOOD GLITZ. 
NOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH 
HOLLYWOOD GLITZ, RIGHT? 
>> RIGHT? 
>> LIKE I AM AS IMPRESSED THAN 
ANYONE, THAT MY OPPONENT BRAGS 
THAT SHE OWNS A PAIR OF SHOES. 
I, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE OVER 
100 COMBAT MISSIONS, SERVING 
OUR COUNTRY. 
 
>> LOOK. 
MY OPPONENT IS SOMEONE WHO IS 
LEFT OF THE PELOSI-DEMOCRATS, 
WHO IS A GREEN PARTY ACTIVIST. 
SHE PROTESTED OUR TROOPS IN A 
PINK TUTU. 
SHE CALLED TO SHUT DOWN LUKE 
AIR FORCE BASE. 
SHE CALLS HERSELF A PROUD PRADA 
SOCIALIST. 
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S RUNNING FOR 
THE SENATE, HOLLYWOOD SINEMA. 
AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT -- 
 
 
AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT CINEMA, 
WITH A "C," HOLLYWOOD CINEMA. 
SHE'S UNDERGONE AN EXTREME 
MAKEOVER. 
FABRICATING A CENTRIST IMAGE TO 
FULFILL HER AMBITION. 
SHE'S A FAKE PRODUCTION, 
RUNNING ON A PHONY SCRIPT, IN 
ORDER TO FOOL THE VOTERS. 
THE CONTRAST COULDN'T BE MORE 
CLEAR. 
I HAVE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN 
TRUE TO WHO I AM. 
AND I'VE SPENT MY LIFE IN 
SERVICE TO OUR GREAT COUNTRY. 
 
 
>> I LEARNED A LOT OF THAT FROM 
MY FATHER. 
YOU SEE, HE WAS THE FIRST IF 
HIS FAMILY -- IN HIS FAMILY TO 
GO TO COLLEGE. 
HE SERVED IN THE NAVY AND USED 
HIS G.I. 
BILL TO GET HIS LAW DEGREE. 
AND HE WAS DRIVEN TO MAKE A 
BETTER LIFE US FIVE KIDS AND 
HIS COMMUNITY. 
AND IN 24 HOURS, WHEN I WAS 12 
YEARS OLD, EVERYTHING CHANGED. 
WE WENT FROM A DAY OF SPENDING 
TIME WITH FAMILY, TO HIM NOT 
FEELING WELL TO GOING TO THE 
HOSPITAL. 
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK. 
AND HE WAS STABLE. 
BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, 
HE KNEW IN HIS SPIRIT HE WAS 
GOING TO GO BE WITH THE LORD. 
AND HE ASKED FOR HIS KIDS TO 
COME SEE HIM. 
I WAS BLESSED TO VISIT WITH 
HIM. 
NOT FULLY REALLY UNDERSTANDING 
WHAT WAS GOING ON. 
BUT IN THAT LAST CONVERSATION I 
HAD WITH MY DAD, HE TOLD ME TO 
MAKE HIM PROUD. 
HE SUFFERED ANOTHER HEART 
ATTACK THE NEXT MORNING AT THE 
AGE OF 49. 
HE LEFT US. 
AND THOSE WORDS MAKE ME PROUD. 
THEY WERE WRITTEN ON A 
PARCHMENT OF MY HEART. 
AS I BEGAN THE NEW GRIEF-
STRICKEN JOURNEY OF LIFE 
WITHOUT HIM, AT TIMES, IT 
HASN'T BEEN EASY AM BUT BY 
GOD'S GRACE, I WAS PROPELLED 
FORWARD, CARRYING ON HIS LEGACY 
AND PAYING FORWARD TO OTHERS 
WHAT HE GAVE FOR ME. 
MY MOM NOW SUDDENLY WENT FROM 
BEING A STAY-AT-HOME MOM IN HER 
EARLY 40s TO BEING A WIDOW AND 
SINGLE MOM WITH FIVE KIDS. 
SHE COULD HAVE SPIRALED INTO 
DESPAIR. 
BUT INSTEAD, SHE SPRUNG INTO 
ACTION. 
SHE WENT BACK TO SCHOOL AND 
BACK TO WORK. 
AND SPENT OVER 30 YEARS IN 
PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
SHE GRINDED THROUGH THE WORST 
OF HER GRIEF, AND SHE 
PERSEVERED. 
BECAUSE HER KIDS NEEDED HER TO. 
SO IF YOU WONDER WHERE I GET MY 
GRIT, TO GO TO THE AIR FORCE 
ACADEMY, TO TELL MY FELLOW MALE 
CADETS, I'M GOING TO BE A 
FIGHTER PILOT, EVEN WHEN IT WAS 
AGAINST THE LAW --  
>> WELL, I WAS JUST RAISED THAT 
WAY. 
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY I 
CHALLENGE MY OWN CHAIN OF 
COMMAND FOR EIGHT YEARS TO STOP 
FORCING OUR FEMALE TROOPS TO 
WEAR FUNDAMENTAL ISLAMIC DRESS, 
WHEN OFF BASE IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
I CALL THAT THE BURQA BATTLE. 
IT'S BECAUSE I WAS RAISE THAT A 
WOMAN SHOULD BE TREATED 
EQUALLY, AND YOU CAN'T KEEP A 
GIRL DOWN. 
 
>> I JUST DON'T HAVE THE 
CAPACITY TO WALK BY A PROBLEM. 
WHETHER IT'S A NEIGHBOR WITH A 
TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS, A FRIEND 
WHO NEEDS A JOB, OR A STRAY DOG 
ALONG THE ROAD. 
JUST ASK MY RESCUED GOLDEN 
BOOMER. 
HE'S NOT HERE TONIGHT. 
HE'D BE EATING EVERYTHING ON 
THE FLOOR. 
AND WHEN I LEARN THAT THE 
WASPS, AARON'S GRANDMOTHER, 
THESE OTHER WORLD WAR WOMEN, 
THESE WOMEN AIR FORCE PILOTS IN 
WORLD WAR II, THESE WOMEN WERE 
MENTORS TO ME. 
THEY PAVED THE WAY FOR ME. 
THEY WERE PERSONALLY SHINING 
THE LIGHT FOR ME. 
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE GATES 
TO ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY 
WAS CLOSED ON THEM BECAUSE OF 
SOME BUREAUCRATIC DECISION BY 
THE ARMY, IT ME OFF. 
AND I SPRUNG INTO ACTION. 
I PASSED A LAW TO FIX THAT. 
 
I -- I COULD NOT STAY SILENT. 
I COULD NOT STAY SILENT. 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, HEROES ARE 
HEROES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR 
GENDER. 
AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT. 
I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT STAY 
SILENT IN THE FACE OF 
INJUSTICE. 
THAT'S WHY I FOUGHT TO DOUBLE 
THE CHILD TAX CREDIT TO PROTECT 
THE CHILD AND DEPARTMENT TAX 
CARE CREDIT, AS PART OF OUR 
HISTORIC TAX CUTS WE PASSED 
LAST YEAR. 
BECAUSE WORKING FAMILIES AND 
SINGLE MOMS DESERVE A BREAK. 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THAT 
INTO LAW. 
 AND WE MUST KEEP 
OUR KIDS SAFE. 
NO PARENT SHOULD FEAR THEIR 
CHILD'S LIFE, WHEN THEY DROP 
THEM OFF AT SCHOOL. 
THAT'S WHY I SPEARHEADED 
LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE MENTAL 
HEALTH ACCESS AND STRENGTHEN 
COMPLIANCE WITH BACKGROUND 
CHECKS AND VOTED FOR THE STOP 
SCHOOL VIOLENCE ACT TO IDENTIFY 
THREATS SOONER AND MAKE SCHOOLS 
SAFER THIS. 
IS COMMONS. 
I -- COMMON SENSE. 
I FOUGHT RELENTLESSLY, TO HELP 
CITIZENS BREAK FREE FROM THE 
CHAINS OF ADDICTION. 
BY DEDICATING RESOURCES TO 
RECOVERY AND TREATMENT. 
FIRST, AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD 
FOR TEEN CHALLENGE OF ARIZONA. 
A FAITH-BASED RECOVERY PROGRAM, 
GETTING AMAZING RESULTS FOR 
PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, STRUGGLING 
WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. 
AND NOW, WHILE I DEPLOY TO D.C. 
AND FOR THOSE WHO SELL WOMEN 
AND CHILDREN INTO PROSTITUTION, 
I HAVE RESPONDED WITH A FULL 
FORCE OF THE LAW. 
THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN. 
THESE ARE OUR YOUNG WOMEN. 
I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR 
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM. 
AND PUT AWAY THOSE WHO ENSLAVE 
THEM. 
 
>> I'VE ALSO FOUGHT FOR THOSE 
SUFFERING FROM DEADLY DISEASES. 
SUCH AS MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR 
PHIL, A MAN WHO HAD BECOME LIKE 
A SECOND DAD TO ME OVER THE 
LAST TWO DECADES -- SORRY, IT'S 
AN EMOTIONAL NIGHT. 
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HEAD AND 
NECK CANCER A FEW YEARS AGO. 
PHIL WAS A PROUD MAN. 
HE BATTLED FOR A YEAR AND A 
HALF, RECEIVING HIS CARE AT THE 
V.A. 
IN THE END, THERE WAS NOTHING 
LEFT THAT THE DO DOCTORS COULD 
DO. 
I WAS BLESSED TO BE IN PRAYER 
OVER HIM WITH HIS WIFE HELENE. 
WHERE IS HELENE. 
>> OVER HERE. 
>> WHOO! 
 
>> AND OUR BELOVED GOLDEN, 
BOOMER, WHO BASICALLY LIVES AT 
BOTH HOUSES. 
AS PHIL TOOK HIS LAST BREATH. 
AND WHEN HE DIED, I VOWED THAT 
I WAS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IN 
MY POWER TO PASS A RIGHT TO TRY 
BILL, KNOWING THAT IF THERE HAD 
BEEN ANY EXPERIMENTAL DRUG OUT 
THERE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WOULD 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TREAT HIM AND 
GIVE HIM HOPE, THAT PEOPLE LIKE 
PHIL SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO 
GIVE IT A TRY. 
WE PASSED THAT AND PUT IT ON 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DESK AND IT 
IS NOW THE LAW OF THE LAND. 
 
AS A COMBAT VET MYSELF, IT'S MY 
CALLING TO STAND WITH OUR 
VETERANS AND ENSURE THEY GET 
THE VERY BEST CARE THAT THEY 
DESERVE. 
THAT THEY EARNED. 
INCLUDING THE INVISIBLE WOUNDS 
OF WAR. 
SEE? 
THIS IS A BIG DIFFERENCE I HAVE 
WITH MY OPPONENT. 
SHE PRENES AND POSTURES FOR THE 
CAMERAS. 
BUT WHEN THE VETERANS WERE 
DYING, WAITING FOR CARE, WHILE 
BUR BUREAUCRATS COOKED THE 
BOOKS AT HER OWN DISTRICT, HERE 
AT THE PHOENIX VA, SHE DID 
NOTHING FOR 15 MONTHS. 
IT WAS ONLY WHEN IT BECAME A 
NATIONAL STORY, BROKE BY THE 
MEDIA, THAT SHE STARTED TALKING 
ABOUT IT TO COVER HER TRACKS. 
I'M NOT A TALKER. 
I'M A DOER. 
I'M AN AVIATOR, NOT A BLOW-
VIATOR. 
 I HAVE FOUGHT FOR 
OUR VETERANS IN OUR CARE. 
AND MY FIRST BILL SIGNED INTO 
LAW WAS FAST-TRACKING OUR 
VETERANS FOR JOBS AT THE 
BORDER. 
THIS WAS A WIN-WIN FOR OUR VETS 
AND OUR SECURITY. 
ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, BY 
WORKING TOGETHER, WE HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO SHOW -- SOREY. 
WE HAVE SHOWN THE ABILITY TO 
SOLVE PROBLEMS. 
AND GET THINGS DONE FOR 
ARIZONA. 
I WORK CLOSELY WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TO CUT TAXES FOR WORKING 
FAMILIES, CREATE JOBS, SECURE 
THE BORDER, HONOR OUR VETERANS, 
AND WHEN I'M IN THE SENATE, 
I'LL WORK WITH HIM TO CONFIRM 
JUDGES WHO UPHOLD THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
 
>> UNLIKE HOLLYWOOD CINEMA. 
THAT'S GOT A NICE RING TO IT. 
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN, UNLIKE 
HOLLYWOOD CINEMA, YOU WILL 
NEVER HAVE TO WONDER WHAT I 
BELIEVE OR WHERE I STAND. 
I BELIEVE IN FREE MARKETS 
BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE 
MOST INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURS, 
WORKERS AND SCIENTIFIC MINDS ON 
THE PLANET. 
I BELIEVE IN A STRONG DEFENSE 
AND A STRONG AMERICA. 
I BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER. 
AMERICA HAS A RIGHT TO ENFORCE 
ITS SOVEREIGN BORDER. 
WE ARE NOT -- 
 WE ARE NOT JUST A 
NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 
WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS. 
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE 
BETWEEN THE TWO. 
I HAVE BEEN LEADING THE EFFORT 
TO MODERNIZE OUR LEGAL 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, CLOSE LEGAL 
LOOPHOLES THE CARTELS EXPLOIT, 
AND BUILD PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
WALL. 
 I BELIEVE WE ARE 
ALL CREATED WITH UNIQUE GIFTS 
FROM A LOVING GOD. 
AND THAT WE ARE CALLED TO LIVE 
LIVES OF PURPOSE. 
MY LIFE'S SCRIPTURE, THAT I'VE 
CARRIED WITH ME ON MANY 
MISSIONS, IS ESTHER 4:14. 
CAN IT BE THAT YOU WERE PUT IN 
THIS POSITION FOR SUCH A TIME 
AS THIS. 
IT GAVE ME STRENGTH TO PUT MY 
MILITARY CAREER ON THE LINE. 
IN A BURQA BATTLE. 
IT GAVE ME STRENGTH TO LEAD MEN 
AND WOMEN INTO COMBAT. 
AND TO STEP UP TO DEPLOY TO 
D.C. AND A CONTINUATION OF 
SERVICE. 
IT IS A QUESTION FOR ALL OF US, 
TO REMIND YOU US, THAT -- 
REMIND US, THAT THE 
OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE ALL BEEN 
GIVEN ARE NOT FOR US. 
IT'S FOR OTHERS. 
CAN IT BE THAT YOU WERE PUT IN 
THIS POSITION FOR SUCH A TIME 
AS THIS? 
IT'S AN AMAZING VERSE. 
IT CONVICTS ME AND IT CALLS ME 
EVERY SINGLE DAY. 
I BELIEVE WE ARE ALL CALLED TO 
LIVE LIVES OF PURPOSE. 
TO TAKE RISKS, TO SHOW COURAGE, 
AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT. 
BUT OUR MISSION -- THIS 
MISSION, IS NOT DONE. 
IT'S JUST GETTING STARTED. 
WE HAVE 70 DAYS. 
WINGMAN AND WINGWOMEN. 
 
43 DAYS UNTIL PEOPLE START 
VOTING. 
SO IN THE WORDS OF THE OLD AIR 
FORCE MOTTO, WE ARE GOING TO 
FLY -- FIGHT AND WIN! 
THANK YOU ALL. 
GOD BLESS YOU! 
 
THANK YOU ALL. 
 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> ALL RIGHT. 
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING THERE TO 
MARTHA McSALLY, CLAIMING 
VICTORY IN THE ARIZONA GOP 
SENATE PRIMARY. 
WE SHOULD NOTE, WE HAVE NOT YET 
CALLED THAT RACE. 
HOWEVER, WE HEARD THERE FROM 
MARTHA McSALLY, VERY MUCH A 
VICTORY SPEECH. 
IN FACT, WE HEARD McSALLY 
THERE, ESSENTIALLY DRAWING 
CONTRASTS AGAINST THE DEMOCRAT, 
KIRSTEN CINEMA, -- KYRSTEN 
SINEMA, CONTRASTING HER 
EXPERIENCE AS A FIGHTER PILOT, 
WITH WHAT SHE IS FLAMING AS 
KYRSTEN SINENA'S EXPERIENCE AS 
A POLITICIAN. 
DESPITE WHAT WE HEARD THERE, 
SOUNDING VERY MUCH LIKE A 
VICTORY SPEECH, WE AT CBS NEWS 
HAVE NOT YET CALLED THIS RACE. 
BUT LESLIE, WHAT ABOUT THAT? 
SHE WASTED NO TIME THERE, GOING 
RIGHT TO THE DEMOCRAT AND 
SAYING THINGS SUCH AS, YOU 
KNOW, HER OPPONENT HAS OVER 100 
PAIRS OF SHOES. 
I HAVE OVER 100 COMBAT 
MISSIONS. 
OBVIOUSLY HIGHLIGHTING HER 
MILITARY SERVICE. 
AND I NEGLECTEDDED TO MENTION 
OFF THE TOP THERE, WE HEARD 
MARTHA McSALLY, LEAD HER 
SUPPORTERS IN A MOMENT OF 
SILENCE THERE, PAYING TRIBUTE 
TO THE LATE SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN. 
BUT SHE REALLY DID NOT, AFTER 
THAT POINT, WASTE ANY TIME, 
LESLIE, GOING AFTER KYRSTEN 
SINEMA. 
>> NO, THIS IS A VERY 
DETERMINED AVIATOR AS SHE SAID. 
AS SHE PAID REFERENCE TO -- 
REFERENCE TO -- REVERENCE TO 
SENATOR McCAIN. 
SHE ALSO TALKED ABOUT BUILDING 
THE WALL. 
I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS GOING 
TO COME UP IN THIS SPEECH. 
AND KIND OF ENCAPSULATED THE 
WHOLE THING WITH HER FAITH AND 
HOW IMPORTANT THAT HAS BEEN TO 
HER. 
SHE IS DEFINITELY SOMEONE WHO 
IS -- I THINK SHE HAS VERY 
SMART PEOPLE AROUND HER. 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE, WHERE YOU 
HAVE A NATIONAL PLATFORM. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE PAYING 
ATTENTION TO HER. 
THIS IS ABOUT RAISING MONEY AND 
GETTING HER EXPOSED THERE. 
AND INTRODUCING HERSELF TO A 
MUCH LARGER AUDIENCE. 
IF YOU CONSIDER MUCH MONEY -- 
HOW MUCH MONEY IS COMING OUT OF 
THAT STATE, IT'S VERY 
IMPACTFUL. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS, 
ANTJUAN? 
>> I THINK IT'S SMART FOR HER 
TO SHIFT THE STRATEGY OF HER 
CAMPAIGN. 
KEEP IN MIND, A PRIMARY STRATEG 
SENAIT AND DAY, COMPARED TO A 
GENERAL ELECTION. 
AND SHE HAS OPERATED WITH NO 
PUNCHES TO HER BAG AT THIS 
POINT. 
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE A 
PRIMARY. 
SO IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. 
SO SHE'S USED THIS AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW REPUBLICAN 
VOTERS, ESSENTIALLY, THE 
SUPPORTERS OF THE TWO MEN SHE 
RAN AGAINST, SAYING, LOOKING, I 
-- LOOK, I CAN BE TOUGH, I CAN 
BATTLE, I CAN RUN IN THE 
JUNGLE. 
AND I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO 
PROVE THAT SHE IS WORTHY OF THE 
NOMINATION, TO THE EXTREME 
PERSONS IN HER PARTY. 
>> THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING 
POINT. 
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THESE 
CANDIDATES BEFORE, WHERE THEY 
COME UP AND DO THIS CONTRAST, 
AND TALK ABOUT THEIR OPTIMISM, 
THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE MOVING 
FOR, LAUDING THESE BIG 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THEY HOPE TO 
BRING TOGETHER. 
THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS WAS 
ABOUT. 
THIS IS ABOUT, I'M A BETTER 
LEADER, I HAVE A BETTER 
CAPACITY, BETTER RECORD, 
COMPARED TO MY OPPONENT, THIS 
IS GOING TO BE A FIGHT THAT I'M 
READY TO TAKE TO NOVEMBER. 
>> WELL, LET'S SET THIS AGAINST 
ALL THE OTHER RACES THIS YEAR. 
FIRST OFF, THIS WILL BE THE 
SIXTH, ALL-FEMALE U.S. SENATE 
CONTEST THIS YEAR. 
>> NOTABLE. 
>> AND DECIDED BY THE STATES. 
THAT IS A RECORD HIGH. 
BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES, 
HISTORIC IN THEIR OWN RIGHTS. 
MARTHA McSALLY, THE FIRST 
FEMALE COMBAT FIGHTER PILOT. 
THAT IN ITSELF IS NOTEWORTHY. 
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, SINEMA, 
ALSO VYING FOR THAT. 
IS THE FIRST OPENLY BISEXUAL. 
IN BOTH CASES, THEY ARE 
DIVORCEES. 
SO YOU NOT ONLY HAVE WOMEN 
RUNNING, BUT WOMEN WHO ARE NOT 
MARRIED, RUNNING. 
IN A YEAR WITH ALL SORTS OF 
FIRSTS AND INTERESTING TWISTS 
AND DEMOGRAPHICS AND GENDER, 
THAT'S ANOTHER INTERESTING 
ELEMENT OF THIS RACE. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH 
MORE PRIMARY COVERAGE IN A 
MOMENT. 
BUT FIRST, A QUICK BREAK. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> WE'RE LAUNCHING A NEW 
SERIES CALLED PAY ATTENTION. 
>> JOHN IS OUR GUINEA PIG AS WE 
EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF 
TECHNOLOGY ON OUR ABILITY TO 
FOCUS. 
>> YOU CAN GO DOWN A RABBIT 
HOLE THAT TELLS YOU AND HERE 
I'M GETTING ANOTHER INSTAGRAM 
PHOTO, A TEXT. 
TODAY I'VE GONE WITHOUT 
TECHNOLOGY AND INCREASINGLY 
I'VE HAD THIS HUNTED FEELING. 
>> YOU'RE STEPPING IN THE WAY 
OF A HABIT. 
IT'S HARD. 
>> HAVING THAT FOCUS BACK WAS 
NICE. 
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THROWING AWAY 
YOUR PHONE. 
IT'S ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH YOUR PHONE. 
>>> HI, I'M ELAINE QUIJANO IN 
NEW YORK. 
IT WAS A BUSY PRIMARY DAY IN 
ARIZONA AND FLORIDA WHERE 
VOTERS DECIDED THE MIDTERM 
MATCH-UPS FOR GOVERNOR, SENATE 
AND THE HOUSE. 
IN ARIZONA CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA 
McSALLY WON THE REPUBLICAN 
PRIMARY FOR SENATE. 
SHE BEAT SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO AND 
DR. KELLI WARD. 
SHE WILL GO UP AGAINST KYRSTEN 
SINEMA WHO WON HER PRIMARY. 
THIS WAS THE RACE TO FILL 
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE'S SEAT AFTER 
HE RETIRES. 
ARIZONA'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR 
DOUG DUCEY WON HIS PRIMARY. 
DUCEY WILL DECIDE WHO FILLS 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S SEAT. 
THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WON'T BE MADE 
UNTIL AFTER McCAIN'S BURIAL, 
BUT THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT OF 
THE NIGHT CAME FROM FLORIDA 
WHERE ANDREW GILLUM WON THE 
DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR GOVERNOR 
BACKED BY SENATOR BERNIE 
SANDERS AND NOW AIMS TO BE THE 
FIRST BLACK GOVERNOR IN 
FLORIDA'S HISTORY. 
GILLUM WILL FACE CONGRESSMAN 
RON DESANTOS WHO DEFEATED ADAM 
PUTNAM IN THE REPUBLICAN 
GOVERNOR'S RACE. 
THIS PRIMARY HAS BEEN TOUTED AS 
A TEST OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
ENDORSEMENT. 
MR. TRUMP BACKED CONGRESSMAN 
DESANTOS AND EARLIER 
CONGRATULATED HIM ON TWITTER 
CALLING IT A FANTASTIC WIN. 
MEANWHILE IN THE SENATE RACE 
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT 
HAS WON HIS PRIMARY WHICH MEANS 
HE'LL FACE OFF AGAINST 
INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR 
BILL NELSON. 
WE HAVE A POWERHOUSE PANEL TO 
HELP COVER EVERY ASPECT OF 
TONIGHT'S RACES. 
CBS NEWS POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT ED O'KEEFE, 
ANTWAN SEAWRIGHT, A DEMOCRATIC 
STRATEGIST WHO ADVISED THE 
HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN, 
LESLIE SANCHEZ, CBS NEWS 
CONTRIBUTOR AND REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST. 
LET'S TURN TO JIM NITZEL, 
EXECUTIVE EDITOR FOR THE TUCSON 
WEEKLY. 
JIM, INTERESTING TO WATCH. 
WE SAW MARTHA McSALLY IN HER 
VICTORY SPEECH IN THIS ARIZONA 
SENATE RACE. 
IT'S McSALLY VERSUS KYRSTEN 
SINEMA. 
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT? 
JIM, I CANNOT HEAR YOU. 
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN TWEAK THAT 
AUDIO. 
I THINK IT'S COMING NOW. 
LET'S TRY IT. 
I'VE GOT YOU NOW. 
TELL US ABOUT THIS MATCH-UP 
HERE BETWEEN KYRSTEN SINEMA AND 
MARTHA McSALLY. 
>> YOU'LL SEE THE ATTACKS 
COMING FROM MARTHA McSALLY AS 
WE JUST HEARD IN HER VICTORY 
SPEECH TALKING ABOUT THE PINK 
TUTU AND HER OPPOSITION TO THE 
WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. 
YOU'LL SEE A MUCH DIFFERENT 
KYRSTEN SINEMA, ONE WHO HAS 
MOVED MUCH MORE TO THE CENTER 
SINCE THE DAYS SHE WAS OUT 
PROTESTING THE WAR. 
SHE WILL BE OUT THERE SAYING 
SHE'S THE CENTRIST CANDIDATE 
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS. 
SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE 
PARTISAN. 
SHE DOESN'T SEE THIS AS A 
REFERENDUM ON DONALD TRUMP AND 
WANTS TO WORK FOR ARIZONANS. 
AT THIS MOMENT SINEMA IS 
LEADING IN MOST OF THE POLLS, 
ú 
EFFORT BY THE McSALLY CAMPAIGN 
TO BLOODY HER UP UNTIL RECENTLY 
IN THE LAST WEEK. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
GOVERNOR'S RACE. 
ARIZONA GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY WON 
HIS PRIMARY. 
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES 
HE'S FACING IN THE GENERAL 
ELECTION? 
>> AGAIN, I THINK IT'S SORT OF 
THE OVERHANG OF DONALD TRUMP ON 
THE ELECTORATE. 
HOWEVER, DUCEY WILL HAVE A LOT 
OF MONEY. 
HE'LL HAVE A LOT OF INDEPENDENT 
CAMPAIGN SUPPORT. 
DAVID GARCIA WAS RUNNING ALMOST 
OUT OF MONEY JUST TO WIN THIS 
PRIMARY. 
I DON'T KNOW HE'LL BE IN A 
POSITION TO MOUNT A VERY 
SERIOUS EFFORT AGAINST DOUG 
DUCEY. 
THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR DEMOCRATS 
IN ARIZONA IS THEY ARE TRAILING 
INDEPENDENTS IN TERMS OF VOTER 
REGISTRATION AT THIS POINT. 
WE HEAR EVERY YEAR THIS IS THE 
YEAR DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO 
COME BACK AND WIN IN ARIZONA. 
WE'LL MAKE THIS A PURPLE STATE. 
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE WATCHING 
LUCY WITH THE FOOTBALL. 
>> ON THAT POINT, JANET THAT 
PAL TAN OWE -- NAPALITANO OF 
THE LAST DEMOCRAT TO SERVE. 
WHO ARE WE LOOKING AT NOW? 
>> DAVID GARCIA, WHO WAS 
PROFESSOR AT ARIZONA STATE 
UNIVERSITY AND RAN FOR 
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC 
INSTRUCTION THE LAST GO-ROUND 
AND WAS THE DEMOCRAT WHO CAME 
CLOSEST TO WINNING A RACE IN 
ARIZONA BUT STILL WASN'T ABLE 
TO GO OVER THE TOP WITH A 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO 
ACTUALLY BARELY LEFT THEIR 
HOUSE TO CAMPAIGN. 
>> DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING TO 
FLIP ARIZONA'S 2nd 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
CURRENTLY HELD BY MARTHA 
McSALLY. 
HOW IS THAT RACE SHAPING UP? 
>> FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN ANNE 
KIRKPATRICK WHO HAS REPRESENTED 
NORTHERN ARIZONA HAS NOW MOVED 
TO SOUTHERN ARIZONA AND APPEARS 
TO BE WINNING THAT PRIMARY.
SHE IS A TERRIFIC FUNDRAISER 
AND HAS WON VERY TIGHT RACES 
BEFORE. 
THE WINNER ON THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE APPEARS TO BE LEAH MARQUEZ 
PETERSON WHO HAS VERY DEEP 
ROOTS HERE IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA. 
SHE HAS BEEN THE LEADER OF THE 
HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 
SHE'S BEEN VERY POLITICALLY 
CONNECTED. 
SHE WAS NOT A TRUMP PERSON 
BEFORE SHE GOT INTO THIS RACE. 
SHE WAS MORE OF A MARCO RUBIO 
REPUBLICAN, BUT SHE HAS SINCE 
BEEN A LOT MORE FRIENDLY TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA. 
SHE'S BEEN REALLY DODGING THE 
PRESS SINCE SHE LOST THIS 
CAMPAIGN. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
INTERESTING DYNAMICS IN YOUR 
STATE, JIM. 
THANKS SO MUCH. 
>> IT'S A PLEASURE. 
>> LET'S TURN TO OUR POLITICAL 
PANEL HERE AT CBSN. 
WE HEARD JIM TALK ABOUT SOME OF 
THE DYNAMICS THERE. 
IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU THINK 
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THE KYRSTEN 
SINEMA/MARTHA McSALLY MATCH-UP. 
WE HEARD FROM MARTHA McSALLY IN 
HER VICTRY SPEECH DRAW THAT 
CONTRAST ALREADY ARE TRYING TO 
BASICALLY FRAME THIS CONTEST 
DRAWING UPON HER OWN EXPERIENCE 
AS A FIGHTER PILOT TO KIND OF 
PRESENT HERSELF AS THE OPTION 
THAT WILL BE THE BEST POSITION 
TO FIGHT AND LET'S TAKE A 
LISTEN ACTUALLY TO SOME OF WHAT 
McSALLY HAD TO SAY. 
>> IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN A DOER 
AND A TALKER, BETWEEN A PATRIOT 
AND A PROTESTER, BETWEEN A 
CAREER FIGHTER PILOT AND A 
CAREER POLITICIAN, BETWEEN 
PROVEN GRIT AND HOLLYWOOD 
GLITZ. 
>> OKAY. 
SO PRETTY TOUGH LANGUAGE HERE 
AND RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE, 
BASICALLY A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S 
TO COME. 
>> MARTHA McSALLY HAS HAD TO 
FOCUS THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS 
ON HER REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS IN 
HOPES OF PRESERVING HER WIN 
TONIGHT. 
SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS 
ON KYRSTEN SINEMA AND WITH SO 
FEW WEEKS UNTIL THE ELECTION 
SHE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE ANY 
TIME TRYING TO DEFINE SINEMA. 
YOU TALK TO DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
WHO MONITOR THESE THINGS AND 
THEY POINT OUT KYRSTEN SINEMA 
HAS GOTTEN A PRETTY FREE PASS. 
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A SERIOUS 
PRIMARY OPPONENT AND HAS SORT 
OF BEEN THE ANOINTED CANDIDATE 
MORE THAN A YEAR AND THERE'S 
BEEN NO PUSH TO GO AFTER HER 
BACKGROUND WHICH POLITICALLY 
HAS SHIFTED FROM BEING SORT OF 
A FAR LEFT LIBERAL OPPONENT OF 
THE IRAQ WAR TO NOW THIS 
MODERATE DEMOCRAT WHO HAS 
SERVED ABLY FROM THE PHOENIX 
AREA THE LAST SEVERAL CYCLES 
AND HAS BEEN SEEN AS A FOR 
MIDDIBLE STATEWIDE CANDIDATE.  
-- FORMIDABLE STATEWIDE 
CANDIDATE. 
MEANWHILE DEMOCRATS SAY McSALLY 
HAS FLIP-FLOPPED STARTING AS A 
MODERATE MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN 
TRYING TO EMBRACE THE POLICIES 
OF THE PRESIDENT AND SHE IS NOT 
EXACTLY WHAT SHE SETS HERSELF 
UP TO BE. 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACK 
EACH OTHER IN WAYS THAT A MALE 
OPPONENT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
ATTACK THEM REGARDING THEIR 
BACKGROUND, THEIR PROFESSIONAL 
HISTORY. 
WE HEARD A LITTLE OF THAT 
TONIGHT FROM MARTHA McSALLY 
GOING AFTER SINEMA'S SUIT 
COLLECTION. 
NO MALE CANDIDATE WOULD EVER GO 
THERE. 
>> YOU MIGHT DO IT TO ME. 
>> YOU AND I COULD DO THAT. 
>> RIGHT. 
HER COMMENT WAS SOMETHING ALONG 
THE LINES OF SHE SAID SHE HAS 
OVER 100 PAIRS OF SHOES. 
I HAVE OVER 100 COMBAT 
MISSIONS. 
WHAT ABOUT THAT LINE OF ATTACK, 
ANTWAN? 
THERE IS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO 
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO 
FEMALE CANDIDATES. 
>> IT'S CUTE AND MIGHT GET HER 
A FEW NOTIFICATIONS. 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS FOR THIS 
RACE THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE 
ONLY RACES IN THE COUNTRY WHERE 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
SERIOUS CONVERSATION AND DEBATE 
ABOUT ISSUES BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
TWO FEMALE CANDIDATES. 
YOU HAVE TWO QUALIFIED FEMALE 
CANDIDATES WHO BOTH HAVE TRACK 
RECORDS OF BEING GOOD LEADERS 
FOR BOTH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE 
PARTIES. 
NOW ISSUES COME INTO PLAY. 
THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE 
DEMOCRATS POSSIBLY COULD HAVE 
THE UPTICK IN THIS RACE BECAUSE 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ISSUES AND 
IF DEMOCRATS DO THEIR JOB OF 
TYING HER TO THE PRESIDENT AND 
THE FAILED REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, 
THAT GIVES THIS WINDOW OF 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATE TO SAY WHAT THE 
DEMOCRATS WILL DO AND WHAT SHE 
IS FOR, NOT NECESSARILY ONLY 
AGAINST TRUMP AND I THINK THAT 
PRESENTS A REAL OPPORTUNITY. 
>> WHAT ABOUT, LESLIE, WHAT WE 
HEARD FROM MARTHA McSALLY WAS 
ESSENTIALLY THE ARGUMENT BASED 
ON HER EXPERIENCE IN COMBAT, 
BASED ON HER OWN LIFE 
EXPERIENCE IN THE BIOGRAPHY SHE 
WAS PRESENTED TO HER SUPPORTERS 
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FACING 
DIFFICULT ISSUES AMONG THEM 
IMMIGRATION OBVIOUSLY IN A 
STATE LIKE ARIZONA THAT SHE'S ú 
TO DO THAT. 
HOW RESONANT DO YOU THINK THAT 
WILL BE FOR ARIZONA VOTERS? 
>> EXTREMELY VOTERS. 
SHE IS GOING TO WIN LOOKING 
MORE LIKE SHE IS IN LINE WITH 
THE PRESIDENT THAN SHE IS 
LOOKING INDEPENDENT. 
THAT'S KIND OF BEEN THE 
CHALLENGE WHERE THE STATE IS 
TURNING. 
SHE HAS TO LOOK STRONG, LIKE 
SHE HAS A TRACK RECORD, 
FORMIDABLE. 
SHE WILL MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS 
AND I WILL PREDICT THERE'S 
GOING TO BE AN AREA WHERE SHE 
HAS TO SHOW SOME INDEPENDENCE 
WHERE SHE CAN MAKE THE TOUGH 
CHOICE BASED ON PROTECTING 
ARIZONA AS OPPOSED TO LOCK STEP 
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF THAT 
VERSUS HER OPPONENT WHO WILL 
START TO SOUND LIKE MORE OF A 
CENTRIST AND REPUBLICAN LIGHT. 
YOU NEVER WIN WHEN YOU'RE KIND 
OF THE WEAKER OR DILUTED 
VERSION OF THE OTHER PARTY AS 
OPPOSED TO THE PROGRESSIVE 
CONTRAST, WHICH IS STILL A VERY 
DIFFICULT ROAD TO WIN IN SOME 
OF THESE, BUT IN A VERY RED 
STATE LIKE ARIZONA SHE'S TAKING 
EXACTLY THE RIGHT TONE. 
IT'S FUNNY IN SOME OF THESE 
ATTACKS AND I THINK IT'S MORE 
THAN THE KIND OF SASSY 100 
SHOES, 100 COMBAT MISSIONS, I 
THINK THAT'S A VERY SHARP ARROW 
DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TO POINT 
OUT THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK 
SUBURBAN WOMEN WILL RESPOND TO. 
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE POINT 
OF SUBSTANCE VERSUS KIND OF THE 
TIME AND MOVEMENT. 
IT HAS A DIFFERENT TONE TO IT 
AND I THINK THAT CAN REALLY 
PLAY AND BE EFFECTIVE. 
>> SO I DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT 
WITH YOU, LESLIE, WITH ALL DUE 
RESPECT. 
>> ONLY A LITTLE? 
GOOD. 
FIVE HOURS LATER IT'S ONLY A 
LITTLE. 
>> BECAUSE YOU ALL ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE ACCUSED CONOR 
LAMB AND DOUG JONES OF BEING 
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY RAN 
REPUBLICANLIKE CAMPAIGNS AND 
RAN ON REPUBLICANLIKE ISSUES. 
>> WE DID SAY THAT. 
>> NOW ON THE COUNTER SIDE 
YOU'RE SAYING THAT DOESN'T 
WORK. 
SO I DISAGREE WITH YOU A LITTLE 
BIT. 
THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT 
WILL BE VERY CRITICAL IN THIS 
RACE IS HOW WILL THE McCAIN 
MACHINE RESPOND TO A PRO TRUMP 
TYPE CANDIDATE? 
WE KNOW TRUMP, FLAKE, ET 
CETERA, THAT WING OF THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ARIZONA 
HAVE NOT CUDDLED AND PLAYED 
FOOTSY WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
SO HOW ENTHUSIASTIC WILL THEY 
BE TRYING TO TURN OUT THEIR 
MODEL OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS TO 
SUPPORT THE NOMINEE OR WILL 
THEY TAKE A CHILL PILL, SIT 
BACK AND WAIT IT OUT TO FOCUS 
ON TRYING TO PUT THEIR NOMINEE 
IN THE McCAIN SEAT? 
THOSE ARE DYNAMICS WE CAN'T 
FIGURE OUT THIS EARLY ON. 
NO ONE CAN GUARANTEE THE McCAIN 
OR FLAKE MACHINE WILL BE ALL IN 
FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, 
PARTICULARLY IF SHE STARTS TO 
RUN A VERY PRO TRUMP STYLE 
CAMPAIGN. 
>> I THINK THERE'S A PRAGMATISM 
ESPECIALLY AMONG PARTY LEADERS 
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THESE ARE 
FUNDAMENTALLY POLITICIANS WHO 
ARE TRYING TO READ THE TEA 
LEAVES IN TERMS OF WHERE THE 
STATE IS GOING. 
THAT'S A FINGER TO THE WIND IN 
THAT SENSE. 
SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE McCAIN 
OPERATIVES TRIED AND TRUE, BEEN 
HERE SO LONG. %
THAT FORMULA IS NOT WORKING 
ANYMORE AND SENATOR FLAKE RAN 
INTO THAT HEADWIND. 
SO THIS NEW DYNAMIC, I THINK 
THERE'S GOING TO BE 
FAVORABILITY TO HER AS 
REPUBLICANS TO PROTECT THE 
SEAT. 
SHE'S CERTAINLY COMPETENT, 
VIABLE AND CAN BE A STRONG 
LEADER. 
LOOKING AHEAD SHE'S THAT NEXT 
GENERATION OF YOUNG LEADERS. 
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST 
POSITIVE ASPECT. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING, ED, 
BECAUSE HEARING THAT BUT ALSO 
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU HAD 
SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT MITCH MCCONNELL, WHEN 
LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE OF THE 
GOP CANDIDATES, RIGHT, LOOKED 
AT MARTHA McSALLY AS REALLY 
BEING THEIR OPTION AND YET IT'S 
A TRUMP FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT. 
SO YOU HAVE THIS INTERSECTION 
OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AS 
EMBODIED BY MITCH McCONNELL 
BASICALLY SAYING THIS IS THE 
PERSON WE WANT. 
YOU HAVE THEN PEOPLE WHO 
WOULD BE SYMPATHETIC AND 
SUPPORT VERY MUCH TRUMP 
POLICIES ALSO GOING TO A MARTHA 
McSALLY. 
>> BUT LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS. 
SHE'S WON ROUGHLY 50% OF THE 
PRIMARY ELECTORATE. 
THE OTHER TWO WOULD HAVE GOTTEN 
48%. 
THAT SUGGESTS A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
STRENGTH. 
IN THE COUNTY LEVEL SHE DID 
JUST FINE IN MARICOPA COUNTY. 
SHE WON A MAJORITY THERE AND A 
MAJORITY IN THE NEIGHBORING 
COUNTIES. 
THAT SUGGESTS HER BASE OF 
SUPPORT IN THE POPULATION 
CENTERS ARE STRONG ENOUGH THAT 
THEY BELIEVE TAKING THAT BASE 
OF SUPPORT, ADDING INDEPENDENT 
VOTERS AND MAYBE SOME MODERATE 
DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T LIKE THE 
IDEA OF KYRSTEN SINEMA BECAUSE 
MAYBE THESE ATTACKS ON HER 
CHARACTER AND PERSONALITY WILL 
STICK AND THEY BELIEVE SHE CAN 
DO THAT. 
KELLI WARD WON'T BE ABLE TO DO 
IT. 
JOE ARPAIO DEFINITELY WAS NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. 
THEY BELIEVE McSALLY WAS THEIR 
BEST SHOT AGAINST SINEMA WHO 
HAS POLLED QUITE WELL FOR ABOUT 
18 MONTHS IN A HYPOTHETICAL 
MATCH-UP WITH McSALLY, JEFF 
FLAKE OR ANYBODY ELSE. 
>> BUT TO YOUR POINT EARLIER, 
HE, SHE'S BEEN POLLING STRONG 
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NO REAL 
ATTACKS ON HER. 
JUST LIKE FLORIDA AND A LOT OF 
OTHER PLACES I DON'T KNOW IF WE 
CAN MEASURE THE ENTHUSIASM GAP, 
NO. 
1, TO BE ANTI-TRUMP. 
IT'S EASIER TO VOTE AGAINST 
SOMETHING THAN FOR SOMETHING, 
NOR CAN WE ACCURATELY MEASURE 
THE CHANGE IN DYNAMICS IN THE 
POPULATION OF THE STATE. 
>> YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT THAT 
EVERY TWO YEARS AND IT HASN'T 
MANIFESTED ITSELF AND YOU KNOW 
THAT. 
>> IT HASN'T YET. 
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY EVERY 
TWO YEARS. 
>> CHANGE IS SLOW AND IF YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN 
FLORIDA AND WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THE GEORGIA PRIMARY, YOU WILL 
SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN. 
CHANGE DOES NOT HAPPEN 
OVERNIGHT. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT FLORIDA
BECAUSE THERE'S A FASCINATING 
DYNAMIC THERE. 
ANDREW GILLUM PULLED OFF AN 
UPSET. 
>> CHANGE. 
>> THESE AREN'T REPUBLICAN OR 
DEMOCRATIC ISSUES. 
THE JOB OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE 
STATE OF FLORIDA IS TO DO WHAT 
IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE 
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING THAT 
GOVERNOR. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN JIM 
DEFEDE IN MIAMI, A POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT WITH WFOR. 
JIM, TELL US ABOUT THIS STORY 
LINE OF THE NIGHT IN FLORIDA, 
ANDREW GILLUM PULLING OFF 
SOMETHING EVEN DEMOCRATS IN THE 
STATE DIDN'T NECESSARILY COUNT 
ON. 
>> NO. 
THIS WORD GETS USED WAY TOO 
OFTEN THESE DAYS, BUT THIS WAS 
A HISTORIC NIGHT.
THE LAST FIVE GOVERNOR RACES 
THAT LOST EVERY TIME WERE WITH 
MODERATE DEMOCRATS FROM THE 
TAMPA BAY AREA. 
ANDREW GILLUM IS NOT A MODERATE 
DEMOCRAT FROM TAMPA BAY. 
HE'S AN AFRICAN AMERICAN, PROUD 
PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL CANDIDATE 
FROM TALLAHASSEE WITH ROOTS IN 
SOUTH FLORIDA. 
SO THE GEORGE SORROWS AND TOM 
STEYER WING OF THE PARTY REALLY 
TRIED TO PUMP HIM UP, GIVE HIM 
THE SUPPORT HE NEEDED TO HANG 
IN THERE WITH THE MILLIONAIRES 
AND BILLIONAIRES HE RAN 
AGAINST. 
THAT HELPED HIM A GREAT DEAL. 
BERNIE SANDERS COMING INTO THE 
STATE HELPED HIM A GREAT DEAL. 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT 
ANDREW GILLUM HAD NO NEGATIVE 
ADS RUN AGAINST HIM, WHICH WAS 
REALLY A FASCINATING DYNAMIC. 
ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES SPENT 
TENS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS ATTACKING EACH OTHER, 
JEFF GREEN ATTACKING GWEN 
GRAHAM, GWEN GRAHAM ATTACKING 
PHIL LEVINE, PHIL LEVINE 
ATTACKING JEFF GREEN, ON AND ON 
AND ON, BUT NOBODY ATTACKED 
ANDREW GILLUM BECAUSE IN LARGE 
PART THE POLLS HAD GILLUM LOW 
AROUND THIRD AND FOURTH PLACE 
AND TWO, I THINK A CALCULATION 
WAS MADE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TRY 
TO WIN BY ATTACKING AN AFRICAN 
AMERICAN CANDIDATE KNOWING YOU 
WOULD NEED THAT AFRICAN 
AMERICAN VOTE IN NOVEMBER. 
WELL, THEY STAYED AWAY FROM HIM 
AND NOW HE'S THE NOMINEE AND 
WHAT YOU'RE SURE TO SEE IS THIS 
IS THE RACE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN 
WANTING ALL ALONG IN THE LEFT 
WING OF THE PARTY IN FLORIDA. 
THEY WANTED A PROGRESSIVE 
CANDIDATE TO CHALLENGE THEIR 
RACE. 
>> JIM, THE CONTRAST COULD NOT 
BE MORE STARK GOING INTO 
NOVEMBER HERE. 
YOU HAVE GOT ON THE DEMOCRATIC 
SIDE IN IN GUBERNATORIAL RACE 
ANDREW GILLUM AND ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE YOU HAVE A 
TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATE IN 
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTOS. 
DESCRIBE THAT CONTRAST FOR US. 
>> HERE'S A SIMPLE NUTSHELL 
THAT SORT OF GETS TO IT. 
ANDREW GILLUM GOT INTO POLITICS 
IN LARGE POT INSPIRED BY BARACK 
OBAMA. 
RON DESANTOS WROTE A BOOK THAT 
WAS BASICALLY A REPUTATION OF 
OBAMA IN WHICH HE ENTITLED HIS 
BOOK DREAMS OF OUR FOUNDING 
FATHERS. 
SO YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES, ONE 
WHO IS PROUDLY CONSERVATIVE IN 
VIEW POINT, THE OTHER WHO IS 
PROUDLY PROGRESSIVE IN HIS AND 
THE FIGHT NOW IS OVER HOW YOU 
ATTRACT THAT VOTE IN THE CENTER 
OR IS IT THE WAY SOME DEMOCRATS 
BELIEVE OR THE REPUBLICANS 
WELL, IS THIS JUST A BASE 
ELECTION? 
DO YOU JUST BRING OUT THE BASE 
IN HUGE NUMBERS AND LET THE 
MIDDLE GROUND SORT OF SORT I 
OUT? 
>> JIM, IT'S ED O'KEEFE AGAIN. 
WHERE IN THE STATE IS EITHER OF 
THESE GUYS GOING TO WIN?
>> DEMOCRATS WILL RACK UP WINS 
IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF 
FLORIDA, BUT ANDREW GILLUM WILL 
WIN THROUGHOUT. 
I THINK ONE OF THE DECIDING 
FACTORS IN THIS RACE. 
I MENTIONED THIS IN ONE OF MY 
EARLIER VISITS WITH YOU GUYS. 
THE LAST TWO GOVERNORS RACES 
OUT OF THE 6 MILLION CAST FOUR 
YEARS AGO, 62,000 VOTES 
SEPARATED FOUR CANDIDATES. 
EIGHT YEARS AGO 5.5 MILLION 
VOTES CAST, AGAIN 60,000 VOTES 
SEPARATED. 
HOW DO YOU GET TO THAT CENTRAL 
GROUND. 
I THINK ONE OF THE KEYS OF THIS 
RACE WILL BE THE STONEMAN 
DOUGLAS SHOOTING AND GUNS. 
I THINK THERE'S A CALCULATION 
BEING MADE NOW THAT THE WAY TO 
ATTRACT THE WOMEN VOTERS, 
COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN 
WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 
2016, ARE THEY TURNED OFF NOW 
TO THE GUN VIOLENCE, THE MASS 
SHOOTINGS, TURNED OFF BY SOME 
OF WHAT THEY HEAR FROM DONALD 
TRUMP AND WILL THEY VOTE FOR A 
CANDIDATE LIKE ANDREW GILLUM? 
THAT'S THE QUESTION DEMOCRATS 
WILL TRY TO ANSWER AND 
REPUBLICANS WILL TRY TO RUN A 
REAL BASE ELECTION AND APPEAL 
TO OTHER ISSUES. 
>> JIM, IF YOU'LL STAND BY, FOR 
OUR VIEWERS WHO ARE MAYBE JUST 
STARTING TO TUNE INTO THE 
FLORIDA CONTEST, WE HEARD FROM 
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS WHO 
WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR 
GOVERNOR IN FLORIDA. 
HERE'S A BIT OF WHAT HE HAD TO 
SAY. 
>> I'M NOT ALWAYS THE MOST 
POPULAR GUY IN D.C., BUT I DID 
HAVE SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
IF YOU WALK DOWN PENNSYLVANIA 
AVENUE, HE LIVES IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE WITH THE PILLARS IN FRONT 
OF IT. 
I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS 
SUPPORT. 
I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR VIEWING 
ME AS SOMEBODY WHO COULD BE A 
GREAT LEADER FOR FLORIDA. 
SO THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
SO, JIM, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
OUTLINES OF THIS RACE NOW, 
YOU'VE COVERED FLORIDA POLITICS 
FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHAT IS 
THE DYNAMIC IN THE STATE RIGHT 
NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE 
ELECTORATE THAT WILL HELP 
DECIDE WHO EMERGES VICTORIOUS 
IN NOVEMBER? 
>> THE ISSUES I THINK RESONATE 
THE MOST WITH VOTERS NOW, I DO 
THINK GUNS AND SAFETY. 
WE HAD ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING IN 
JACKSONVILLE. 
YOU HAD THE STONEMAN DOUGLAS 
SHOOTING ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS 
AGO. 
YOU HAD THE PULSE SHOOTING. 
THOSE SHOOTINGS ARE RESONATING 
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. 
I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS 
ANOTHER CRITICAL ISSUE. 
YOU HAVE THE TOXIC GREEN ALGAE 
SLUDGE COMING OUT OF LAKE 
OKEECHOBEE THAT IS DECIMATING 
BOTH THE EAST AND WEST COASTS 
OF FLORIDA. 
THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT 
BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS 
ARE POINTING THE FINGER AT EACH 
OTHER ON. 
I WOULD SAY THE THIRD ISSUE IS 
HEALTHCARE. 
THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF 
FLORIDIANS WITHOUT HEALTHCARE 
AND THE STATE IS NO CLOSER TO 
SOLVING THAT ISSUE THAN FOUR OR 
EIGHT YEARS AGO. 
RON DESANTIS VOTED TO ELIMINATE 
OBAMACARE. 
ANDREW GILLUM WANTS MEDICARE 
FOR ALL. 
SO YOU'VE GOT VERY STARK 
CONTRASTS. 
>> JIM, WHAT IS THE THING 
YOU'LL WATCH MOST CLOSELY IN 
THIS PARTICULAR MATCH-UP 
BETWEEN RON DESANTIS AND ANDREW 
GILLUM? 
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT 
WHERE THE MONEY COMES IN. 
WHETHER OR NOT THE DEMOCRATS 
WILL FIGHT HARD FOR THIS AND 
THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THE 
DEMOCRATS WILL PUMP MONEY. 
IN LOOK, RON DESANTIS WILL BE 
ABLE TO RAISE -- MONEY IN. 
LOOK, RON DESAN  -- DESANTIS 
WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH. 
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK 
PEOPLE LOSE TRACK OF IN TERMS 
OF WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT GOING 
FORWARD IN THE GOVERNORS RACE 
IS REDISTRICTING WILL TAKE 
PLACE IN 2020 AFTER THE CENSUS. 
WHOEVER IS ELECTED GOVERNOR NOW 
WILL OVERSEE THE REDISTRICTING 
OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA FOR 
CONGRESSIONAL RACES. 
THAT COULD BE CRITICAL. 
THE LEGISLATURE WILL DIVIDE IT 
UP. 
IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A 
REPUBLICAN LED LEGISLATURE, BUT 
IF THERE'S A DEMOCRAT IN THE 
GOVERNOR'S MANSION, THEY CAN 
THREATEN TO VETO THOSE BILLS 
AND IT COULD BE A VERY 
DIFFERENT THING IN TERMS OF 
REDISTRICTING. 
I'M GOING TO LOOK TO SEE WHERE 
THE MONEY IS COMING INTO THIS 
RACE. 
>> JIM, THANKS SO MUCH. 
WE'LL HAVE MORE PRIMARY 
COVERAGE IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST 
A QUICK BREAK. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
