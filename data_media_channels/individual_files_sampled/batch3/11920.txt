previously on the great American pilgrimage the iron horse this was the technology that decimated herds and herds of Buffalo you would be like almost the best Percy with some of the best knowledge came and gave out handbook people arrived and as I'm doing that you'll learn more about the people hey everybody I'm Stephen Baldwin gosh I look fantastic Hollywood guy usual suspects my favorite movie proud American first of all I'm dressed as George Washington Shore and RV enthusiast uncle Steve this is my buddy max famous financial guru and well he's a little bit different I'm honest Abraham Lincoln oh my god they're rolling our windows last but not least my larger-than-life convenient an aspiring star real with all the drama happening in our great country I'm hitting the road to have some fun me everyday Americans don't know forward what's America do you our ancestors suffered the most and see how things got so crazy I was naked completely naked he bit my finger off hopefully start to bridge the gap this is the great American pilgrimage let's go for a ride in an octave tally mark with our culture and our people the awesome show you some sights brilliant you picked back up with our hero in North Dakota and the pilgrimage continues on Stephen and Dave head out on the road to take a tour of Standing Rock here we go I've tried this RV out guys 1 2 3 Stephen is excited to show Dave his RV and his awesome driving skills somebody grab Rio don't just put him on the bed he'll he'll lay down now that we're rolling what do you think so far Dave Stieb out there we did put my date seatbelt on do that support usually if the driver wears the seat down he's come for me to put mine on so that's not just some kind of an Indian custom that is common sense no as they leave Dave's convenience store Dave explains to Stephen why starting his own business was important and what that means for his people so that was my little store right we bought it probably about 15 years ago and we've been running it since then there was no Indian owned businesses here on Standing Rock and I wanted to show our members that we could do it we could own our own businesses we could have our own commerce with each other and sure I want it to be an example and I also want it to be like a role model we bought it and it was really challenging because standing around we have about 40% poverty rate with poverty we have high unemployment we have high abuses WB's alcohol abuse hydrate to drop our high school dropout so all the symptoms of poverty exists on Standing Rock and it's it's a result of all the things that have taken place over time over 200 years Dave had loved to hear more about the history of the land yeah there's a long history where they took the federal government took and took and took and to the point we're not just standing Ross but all Indian tribes all Indian nations are saying stop doing that every since this these lands were discovered we have been considered less than human it was the 1400s with the with the Roman Catholic Church and the papal bulls and the doctrine of discovery when you discover new lands those lands are yours with all the riches and when the question is asked what about the people who are part of that land and they said well they're less than human because they don't know about God they don't know about the church and that was from the 1400s and that kind of laid out the history for this government and the the foundation for the laws when it came to property in 18 or yeah 1823 there was a case Johnson versus McIntosh and a judge based his ruling off of the doctrine of discovery and that became the foundation of taking our lands and I wasn't until 1851 where the federal government said we should enter into agreement so this agreement became the first treaty 1851 as a treaty that defined them the lands where we are today and it was over 60 million acres with the 60 million acres we had disputes because more and more Westerners were going through our treaty lands to Bozeman Montana they called it the Bozeman trail so from that point the Bozeman trail is that the Black Hills no that's the Bozeman trail goes to Bozeman Montana so right the Rocky Mountains in Montana a gold and there was gold discovered now that was 1868 and shortened a short time after that 1874 Custer General Custer led an expedition into the Black Hills and the Black Hills is the heart of our people where our tribes are the Great Sioux Nation said this is our origin story this is where we came from we came from the Black Hills we came from Wind Cave and we came with the Buffalo at one time as far as I can see they were buffalo the Buffalo was everything it was our our relative he provided our housing for us with our teepees he provided food he provided tools he provided anything and everything we needed it was that he was our economy the buffalo were part of who we are so railroad systems came through our lands and for sport people on the railroad system was sheep buffalo and just kill him there's pictures in a North Dakota historical site that shows mountains of buffalo stalls they had to go out and pick up the Buffaloes calls on a prairie because they were so much everywhere right millions so there were 70 million Buffalo in early 1800 by the end of 1800 there was less than a hundred that changed our way of life and that was that was the result of one infrastructure project so this is a type of stuff that has been happening to our our nation over and over and over in 1877 after the gold was discovered the federal government came in and passed an act through Congress to take more lands so they took our Black Hills by 1889 they put us on current day reservation Standing Rock Sioux tribe was established as 2.3 million acres it's the size of Connecticut by 1910 we had less than a million acres left so over half of it the acreage was dispersed to non-indians coming onto the reservation for settlement and they disregarded us at that time we were not even considered citizens of this country we didn't become citizens until 1924 so we didn't have a voice we didn't have a safe but yet every action that they took had a negative impact on us and the reason why they took the land was for economic development Steven is learning how the history of the treatment of Native Americans is repeating itself what we're going right now is last year we had a movement that started here on on Standing Rock good evening friends our top story tonight the ongoing dispute at the Standing Rock reservation tensions are heating up once again at the Dakota access pipeline that's where thousands of people have been coming to for this is a 3.8 billion dollar pipeline that cuts across four US states the struggle to protect the drinking water and ancestral lands from the pipelines construction at times led to violent confrontations between activists who call themselves water protectors and the police if you were to come here last year at this time there will be cars and horseback riders and teepees there were people coming from all over we had over 10,000 people from the Standing Rock and they came because we're standing up against a pipeline this pipeline is gonna cross on the other side of the river and if anything happens to it the first people impacted by this less is our people so we wanted to do a more in-depth study environmental impact frightening what impact will it have on people as well this is where the camp to the right was this whole field right here is whole field on this side was the camp was the GPS and everything and on top we had our media center but it was nicknamed Facebook kill right now this little hill here yeah no kiddin why Facebook Hill is that was the only place people could get on Facebook well thank goodness for that there wasn't even Wi-Fi it's just cell coverage just kidding right but any connection to the Internet was ready there oh that's fun so this was the main entrance into the castle and we had flags from all the nations that came in visit us all Fanning up like that one flag post and in there you come around the corner there's a bridge here and this is called the backwater bridge there was a confrontation here where the militarized police watered down protesters oh yeah sprayed with water extreme temperature cold temperatures and they use water then the people around the corner is where everything really started there was a the route of the pipeline and then they needed to build an access road where the access road was being built that's where the main protests began that was another altercation we had there was a attack dogs use so as I progressed the police became more and more militarized more and more force was used and there were more and more people coming there are thousands of people right now heading to Standing Rock to be water protectors Dave built the most highly militarized road block felt like you know with the Gaza Strip looks like the group Amnesty International says it's very concerned about how police in North Dakota have treated protesters it says the use of force by police violates protesters rights to a peaceful protest I watch people shot with rubber bullets i watch peaceful prayerful water protectors get maced in pepper sprayed and none of them fighting back and one time we had veterans from all around the world come to stand with us over 4,000 veterans came we had 10,000 people and that's what happened here there was an awakening because there was an awakening tribes now know that this is a turning point for us to try to make our lives better and come away from what the federal government has left for us we need people here to stay with us in solidarity but we're not even people are wondering is it gonna end well not not tomorrow right here where the upcoming approaches that's where the pipeline crossing actually is this road coming up here on the right yeah and you could turn there to turn around you can see the route right there where the land is scarred that's the pipeline route and it goes over the hill hang on cuz I ain't stopping now mr. Lord hollers at me so this is this is our community cannonball these are hood house housing and urban development sure they're low rent income housing and the rent depends on the salary that you make so it's a incentive not to work because if you don't have an income you don't have to pay for the house there's not enough houses to accommodate the amount of people who live here right so we get little things like this this is a FEMA trailer they're in Katrina they need a temporary housing so they got and and after housing wasn't needed they fumigated them and they shipped them up here for us the problem with these FEMA trailers is they are very low efficient so it costs about eight hundred bucks a month to heat in the wintertime at eight hundred bucks a month to cool in the summertime so it's just a bad design that's a bad distillation and all that they're not even made for this climate but it's it's better than nothing what do we got here this is the cannonbaugh Elementary School which would the fence around just an elementary school well they anticipated that you're coming in this area on being that you can't be within 50 feet of a school they put the fence up to remind you no I'm kidding right now what do we got here this is the cannonbaugh elementary school what's with the fence around just an elementary school well they anticipated that you're coming in this area on being that you can't be within 50 feet of a school they put the fence up to remind you no I'm kidding turn left here Dave yep under your house as Stephen does his best to get further than 50 feet away from the school we could turn here he ends up at Dave's house which is a hundred feet of with it what we're gonna do is we're gonna drive straight up to here and then we will just back off I'm just gonna turn it different left here back it there to go out the signal straight and then we're back on I'm gonna be ignorant thespian creative and just put a cherry on top and say hey Dave I've driven these suckers a whole bunch in the last it's it's it's your land but it's my army actually it belongs to the good people at outdoorsy okay Stephen and Dave head inside so Stephen can get a little more personal hey ma'am I want to know you want I'm curious about you as far as cuz you're a little rambunctious you have a great sense of humor but you haven't your knowledge is extensive like you almost talk like a lawyer but you don't have a lot of gray so I'm just wondering how did you how did she have tain all this knowledge get out of here where did you find the time to go to law school I never went to law school I got an honorary degree from Vermont Law School no wait they asked me to come and give a talk in so I um I went off and I was honored it is honor that's good cuz if anybody here ever gives you a hard enough time you just go ahead man yeah and it's a doctor of law yeah what makes it even better so I got a doctor do you give me that quick rundown where are you from did you play ball what'd you do I was raised on on the Pine Ridge Reservation all the way up to 6th grade my dad was a coach he was the head coach for for basketball he was a head coach for cross country and in 1979 his team won with cross country state champ by the time I reached sixth grade he became the athletic director / basketball coach for a United tribes Technical College so he brought us up to Bismarck North Dakota after high school Nicole she actually snagged me if you remember Nicole is Dave's wife from the last episode it became my high school sweetheart we ended up going to Bismarck State College so who talked to who first so I'll tell you what happened that's what I want to know we were we were good friends her dad worked with my dad but she didn't know that I had a major crush on her she was like the most beautiful picture in a world and then when I was a senior in back and I was playing basketball I said if I score 30 points tonight can I get a kiss she's okay so what Nicole doesn't know is that I can score anytime I want but I don't I try to get the other team I'm a team player I want everybody to skip the score I so we play and I score 30 points so then I get a kiss and it's like fireworks endlessly buzzing usually you know there's an old saying when you're dating someone you want to score some points you literally took that as the literal idea and in order to score some points you had to score some points you can ask her if that's true and she'll confirm but I think you know even then she was hopeful that I would squirty so we both went to school we went to North Dakota State University you know there's there's something about both Nicole and I that's unusual both of us chose to come back to standing up and raise our kids here now the grass always seems greener they're off the reservation but we were both raised on the reservation and we turned out okay so what's wrong with this picture here there's something wrong what has the changes are the codes well how do you change the codes you have to become the government you have to become the code maker you have to be on a tribal council so I get into politics and I get on tribal council at first I didn't think that a chance I just say I'm gonna run and so I put in my name in the Hat and they elect me so now I'm on tribal council and I come in my eyebrows like this far apart after four years my eyebrows are touching because I can it said I'm one of seventeen and I can't change it I can't reform the government my two years go by and the Chairman's seat cover so when I came in I get elected 2013 and in order for us to accomplish economic development business the moment in order for us to accomplish government reform in order for us to get the workforce and the skill set the answer lies within education and it lies within investing in our youth so as a chairman what I did was I focused on what we can do for those the kids how can we empower our kids let's head back outside talk a little more Dave take Steven outside to show him the views and also help him understand the problems brewing in his backyard well Dave this is the view from your backyard yep this is it and you have this beautiful body of water tell me about it right here where we're looking was once where the cannonball community was this is a result of the Flood Control Act if you look at the river it's not a liver anymore it's a lake so what the federal government doesn't in 1944 they passed the Picts Lona and in 58 actually flooded it because of the flood it killed all the pot cottonwood trees they killed all the plants they killed all the the natural habitat and we were forced to relocate on the hilltops so that's why our community is up here today so I understand completely before this what looks like a lake that there was a thriving part of your community is there any industry or business that was coming out of it or yeah there was it was easy to access the other side of the river so we had our tribal members they were able to cross the river and they were able to help the farmers and ranchers on that side if you go further south along the river they had a hotel they had a bank and they had a railroad system that what year was this around this had to be in the 40s right so there was a thriving economy that was a result of the river but when the federal government flooded the lands those industries those businesses had died but this is just an example you have three infrastructure projects that had a significant impact on our people on our child and when I say significant impact I mean literally changing the way we lived if you can see where the tower is right there that is where the pipeline goes there's a high chance that that can break and if it gets into water the spill response plan the company has is to push everything onto this side of the river not that side that's off the reservation so when I push everything so this is right below my house and and they're saying this is where we're gonna clean it up when we say what impact is it gonna have on us they said oh it's there's no impact here you have nothing to worry about but we know it is because we were told the same thing over and over in the past and I said well why do you need this infrastructure project what's the reason for cross in the river with this pipeline at this point and they said well we need it for three reasons we need it for economic development we need it for energy independence for this nation and we need it for national security so I said we already pay for our energy independence with this dam you create hydropower we're already paying for it we already pay for national security you taking the gold out of the Black Hills to back your currency we're already paying for economic development you took our land those three things our people have been paying for we continue to pay for it we paid a cost now who benefits we live in a state of dependency we have high rates of poverty we have all the symptoms that's the cost that we pay for this nation and our ancestors suffered the most so it's our responsibility to remember that you know the messaging today either in the culture and the media or whatever is like you know oh the problems with Native American Indians today oh that's old stuff to talk about that when I ask anybody what do you think about that they'll say well that wasn't us we were not the ones who took your land that was our ancestors so get over it they don't really understand that that behavior that was done in the 1900s and the 1800s is happening today and it's mm it's happening right now and that pipeline is a perfect example of it it's it's 2017 you know the mean and with all the technology that we still have these squabbles and whatever it's funny because there's so many times when you're talking and I'm listening and I'm just going or I want to say something but the problem has been the listening that's why he's been so quiet this episode and the lack of understanding across the country with with all the issues I think it's just more it's mostly people wanting to be heard than having a willingness to listen but tell me what in all of who you are and all of what you said what's America to you to me personally absolutely straight up America represents and this is my perspective and I don't want to offend anybody but it represents somebody who is a perpetrator who raped somebody early on did it again did it again and everybody thinks it's okay and an awakening that you hear is the first nations the first people of these lands the first occupants of these lands saying that that's not right and listen for what it's like we don't have to be the victim anymore right so in order for you to not be the victim you have to learn how to forgive not forget but let's learn how to forgive and let's find a way so that our children and their children and their children have it better than what we have I am no longer gonna be the chairman of Standing Rock Sioux tribe it was an honor and a privilege for me to serve but um I'm focusing on now what can I do to continue the movement continue to make change inspired and not just new things for Standing Rock but for before all that sounds pretty good sir well thank you again appreciate it thank you this part of the pilgrimage has come to an end as our hero says goodbye to Dave he has bequeathed with a gift a hat with Dave's sacred tribal seal for Dave this is a pretty big deal for Stephen he has gained further insight into the problems facing the ancestors of the original Americans now our hero sets his sights on the Midwest where he will hopefully find max and continue on this great American pilgrimage next time on the great American pilgrimage he's got a good gig for the next day I was told by your crew that if I fed them I would get credits in production well for feeding them yeah you know they were hungry you had them working and we can do that I have the power to do that days on all episodes no all the beans no no you get that one you had more than one one shown here
