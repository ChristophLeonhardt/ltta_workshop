THURSDAY.
JOHN ROBERTS HAS MORE FROM THE
WEST WING.
>> GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE OF
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S OP-ED.
THE WHITE HOUSE ATTEMPT TO WIN
OVER ENOUGH SENATORS TO GET IT
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.
I SPOKE WITH A SOURCE IN THE
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE VOTE
THAT JUST TOOK PLACE TO SAY
WHAT ABOUT MURCOWSKI.
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET HER
BACK?
I WAS TOLD NO, THEY PROBABLY
WON'T BE ABLE TO CONVINCE
MURCOWSKI TO VOTE FOR JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AFTER VOTING NO FOR
THE CLOTURE VOTE.
THEY DO THINK THEY WILL BE ABLE
TO HANG ONTO JOE MANCHIN AND
BELIEVE THAT HE WILL -- HE IS
IN A TIGHT RACE IN WEST
VIRGINIA THOUGH HE LEADS BY
NINE POINTS.
THEY BELIEVE THAT MANCHIN WILL
VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
THEY ALSO THINK THAT FLAKE AND
COLLINS ARE ON BOARD AS WELL.
SO WITH SENATOR STEVE DAINES OF
MONTANA OUT IN MONTANA TOMORROW
FOR THE WEDDING OF HIS DAUGHTER
THAT MEANS THEY HAVE 50 VOTES.
THEY COULD GO 50-49.
IT GIVES THEM A WIN.
IF THEY NEED TO BRING SENATOR
DAINES BACK AND KEEP THE VOTE
OPEN THEY'LL DO THAT AS WELL.
PART OF THE CONCERN WITH
KAVANAUGH OVER THE LAST SEVEN
DAYS HAS BEEN HIS TEMPERAMENT
AND TONE DURING THAT HEARING
LAST WEEK.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TRIED TO
ADDRESS IT TODAY IN THE "WALL
STREET JOURNAL" OP-ED THAT YOU
MENTIONED OFF THE TOP WHICH YOU
SAID MY TESTIMONY REFLECTED MY
OVERWHELMING FRUSTRATION AT
BEING WRONGLY ACCUSED.
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL
AT TIMES AND I SAID A FEW
THINGS I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID.
I HOPE EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND
I WAS THERE AS A SON, HUSBAND
AND DAD.
GOING FORWARD YOU CAN COUNT ON
ME TO BE THE SAME KIND OF JUDGE
AND PERSON I'VE BEEN FOR MY
ENTIRE 28-YEAR LEGAL CAREER,
HARD WORKING, EVEN KEELED,
INDEPENDENT AND DEDICATED TO
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE PUBLIC
GOOD.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS
HELPED SENATOR COLLINS AND
SENATOR FLAKE BE MORE
COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR HIM.
THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE
