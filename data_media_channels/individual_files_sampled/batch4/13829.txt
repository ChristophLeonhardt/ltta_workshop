the reason they dropped laura ingraham show is because she tweeted something out yesterday which we discussed in which she suggested i'm gonna quote her directly she said david hog rejected by four colleges to which he applied and whines about it we played the clip of david hog who is the Parkland shooting survivor who's obviously made a name for himself saying pretty vicious things on television about Second Amendment advocates Dana lash Gio Peters he's he's been pretty brutal to everyone who disagrees with him and he's wanted to have it both ways David hog and again there's not a criticism of his right to speak obviously he has the right to speak and he should speak however much you want and this isn't a criticism of his status as a survivor obviously something awful that never should happened to anybody of decency happened to David Hagen that's awful and unforgivable but he's now in the political debate and that means that there's some slings and arrows that come with the political debate I know this okay when I was 17 years old the same age as David hog I started writing a syndicated column and I got clubbed about the ears for it and a lot of that was deserved because guess what at 17 you don't know everything and sometimes your perspectives are wrong and if you join in the political debate then it is open season on your politics and by the way it's not to not to be liked insults are bad people saying silly stupid things about you that's that's nasty but it does happen on a relatively regular basis okay for years I was called the virgin been in the left-wing press okay that is not a joke from the time I was 17 there there were people who were calling me the virgin bed because obviously I was a nerd who had never had sex and I was proud about the fact that I hadn't had sex and I was a virgin until I was married but I was called the virgin Ben not once did I ever call for the people who are calling me the virgin Ben to lose their advertising base and my retaliatory response was always okay let's talk about ideas or you're an idiot okay that's the way that politics works David hog however called immediately for an advertiser boycott on Laura Ingraham and all these advertisers complied a lot of advertisers comply with this stuff because they're afraid that they don't really want the controversy they're concerned that any controversy associated with their product is gonna hurt their sales the reality is these boycotts don't really work very well when they tried to an actual boycott against chick-fil-a for example it failed immediately and I remember just a few weeks ago months ago when Karen Coffey was was bullied into dropping Sean Hannity as an advertiser Sean fought back and Keurig reinstated their advertisement within like a week so all this talk about advertiser is really feeling the impact of politics it's just not true people don't not buy products because they don't like the the programs that advertisers advertise on right secondary boycotts generally do not work that's worth noting but one of the questions I want to ask here is what is this boycott against Laura really about she's come out and apologized now so if you said that it was about civility if you said it's about decency she shouldn't have said what she said I don't think she should have said what she said either right so that yesterday on the show but if you think this boycott is about civility or decency you got another thing coming because now she's apologized okay status quo ante restored right we're all supposed to be cordial with the parkland survivors which we should be we should be decent with the Parkland survivors which we should be I have been very focused on doing that throughout this entire entire horrible mess that's happened in the aftermath of an even more horrible horrible incident obviously but decent use restored right well not right because after Laura Ingraham apologized David hog said I want to continue to boycott Laura Ingraham Ray said I want to continue to boycott Laura Ingraham so here is hog rejecting Laura Ingram's apology that they cannot push us around especially when we're all we're trying to do here is save lives and when people try to distract like Laura's trying to do right now from what the real issue here is which is gun violence in America it's not only sad it's just wrong from a journalistic standpoint I would say that she needs to be more objective and needs to stand down because I am not the issue here the issue needs to be gun violence in America but what she's trying to do is to distract from that ok well the boy okay first of all I seriously doubt that David hog hates the attention I think that you know when it comes to him pushing a boycott that's that's successfully working I think against luring rooms advertisers I really doubt that David hog laments that and and as far as who's taking us off focus on the gun control stuff you know none of this has to do with gun control or shouldn't said what she said hog shouldn't have made an issue out of it it's really like none of this really has to do with gun control or saving lives pretty clearly I don't know what he means when he says that Laura should be more objective she's obviously conservative and she says so even Allison camerata jumps in at that point and says well she's not an objective host that's not him just rejecting her apology here's its clip three where hug rejected Ingram's apology he said I 100% agree in apologies and effort just to save your advertisers is not enough I will only accept your apology only if if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I in this fight it's time to love thy neighbor not mudslinging children okay so this tweet is really telling okay what hog is doing here is wildly inappropriate first of all he doesn't have to accept our apology you never have to accept an apology but if we're gonna pretend that this is some sort of principled non acceptance of an apology it is it is clearly not right when he says the Emma knees thanking he's thanking all of the advertisers that are dropping Laura Ingraham because he likes the fact that he's wielding this sort of power against Ingram for engaging in what is by any sort of political standard rather mild stuff ray he's tweeting at her hashtag shut up and be objective and be objective it go back to the original tweet for just a second the first one right so he's when he says here it's time to love thy neighbor not mudslinging at children two things that David hog is saying here again none of this is an attack on hog as a person right hog might be a fine upstanding person although I think that his behavior here is really questionable and I think that his behavior for the last couple of weeks in labeling all of his enemies evil has been really quite vile but maybe he's it maybe he's a good person okay he seems like a smart kid okay but this last line is time to love thy neighbor not mudslinging children once you step out in the public debate and you start speaking publicly on issues of consequence you no longer get to hide behind the title child that Kyle cashew who is a classmate of hogs in any younger class then David hog right I don't think the Kyle is Kyle's not a senior I think he's a sophomore right Kyle yeah or junior Kyle came out he said you don't get to pretend you're a child and then at the same time say that you're an adult you ought to be ruling the world with regards to these policies and when it comes to David hog saying you ought to love thy neighbor and that he's standing up for civility again I'm not defending Laura's comment I'm not saying she shouldn't have apologized I am saying that David hog pretending to be an advocate of civility is is pretty astonishing and launching a boycott on behalf of civility as David hog is pretty astonishing because here are all the things that David hog has said just in the last two weeks about his political opponents is clip ten pathetic because I want to keep telling our children they could have blood from children splattered all over their faces and they wouldn't take action because they all still see those dollar signs I'm gonna start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to know how much Marco Rubio took for every students life in Florida one dollar and five cents okay I mean do you think that's unnecessarily provocative no I think it's not enough per bag I don't think it's even provocative enough when your old parents like I don't know how to send an iMessage you know just like give me the phone sadly that's what we have to do with our government because our parents don't know how to use a mock recei so we have to what Dana's trying to do the I believe she's the CEO of the NRA she's trying to distract people if you listen to her talk she's the national spokeswoman for the NR exactly she owns these congressmen she can get them to do things it's just she doesn't care about these children's lives it just makes me think what's sick they don't want to continue to sell more guns murder more children and honor so just get reelected what type of person are you when you want to see more money than children's lives how what type of person does that if you can't get elected without taking money from child murderers why are you running with rick Scott it's like when I get elected to Senate we're not gonna let that happen and that's the great thing about it because those aren't gonna get reelected when you start hearing from your political aides that there's a load of angry future voters you start to worry okay love the neighbor love that okay I'm sorry you don't get to play the love that neighbor card when this has been your stick for the last couple of weeks okay you really don't it just doesn't wash so what's the boycott really about the boycott of course is about politics it's about political opponents of Loras who see an opening and now they're gonna Club her right because this is how Media Matters operates this is how the left operates with their boycott tactics that if somebody makes a boo-boo then no apology is sufficient and they will jump in and they will attempt to remove your advertising base and you can see this from the way that the media continued to treat this entire issue so over on MSNBC right the MSNBC panel says that Laura Ingraham is using she's losing advertisers over her casual cruelty right MSNBC is jumping on this because MSNBC is a Fox News competitor this is all political to pretend this is not political is to ignore reality obviously you don't business Laura Ingraham because of her easy and casual cruelty that she inflicts out on people on a daily basis and again to John Heilemann point what you see is another example of an adult acting terribly okay and what you're seeing here is what the media have done and they've been doing this since the shooting and I object to it what they've done is they've taken these kids who really don't necessarily know anything about gun control they have an evidence tremendous knowledge about the issue and they are using them as stand-ins for their own opinion and then if those kids opinions are attacked the media jumps out in front says hey how dare you attack these kids and the media is pretty much admitting this right brian Stelter on CNN says listen we're not treating these kids as we would treat any other guest in our program we're not calling them when they say things that are blatantly factually erroneous right he was questioned about this by a c-cup on CNN Headline News is clip 11 here's Stelter explaining yeah we don't ask them real questions we just have them come out and tried out their political point of view and then if anybody attacks their political point of view then we basically say those people are bad people when I was interviewing David hog ten days after the massacre there were a few times I wanted to jump in and say let's let's correct that fact and that one of the times I did and other times I did not and you know there's always that balance because this is a victim out on one hand who is entitled to his own emotional response yeah but at the same time as news people when we hear something to monstre bleah untrue right you want to go in and say when you called a dilash center a CEO interrupted and corrected that but there are other times when I think all of us can agree any of these students at any of these parents we want everybody to be as well inform as we can yeah about the the contours of this debate okay but you didn't stop this kid when he was out there saying that Dana lash ran the that that she ran Congress right you didn't stop and nobody at Alton Cammarata didn't stop David Hogg when he went on the air and he called everybody opposed him akin to a child murderer right this is what CNN has done this is what CNN has been awful on this I said this directly to brian Stelter last week right this is nothing that I haven't said publicly on CNN to CNN so I'm gonna talk a little bit more about this in just a second because I think the ultimate example of this was Allison Cammarata this morning on CNN I will show it to you it's pretty egregious and again this isn't even about Hogg anymore right Hogg as a kid who was using a platform that's being given to him by the media and he seems like a smart kid he seems like a motivated kid he also seems like somebody who's saying things that are deeply immoral and the media aren't using him as a prop in order to say those things and I think that the media are the really problematic people here I think that it's quite disgusting what they're doing but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at links so do you need a drink because I do okay well if you do then wink is the place for you winc it's a great resource it makes enjoying town time that much easier and you know even I enjoyed a glass

media bias obviously is CNN and the worst example on CNN has been Allison camerata he's just been awful on this she's had on survivor after survivor all on the left she wouldn't have on Kyle kasher because Kyle cash who once tweeted out that CNN was fake news well speaking of fake news here was heroes Allison Camerata questioning David Hogg this morning about all of this college hubbub so remember this whole thing started with with him going on TMZ been talking about being rejected by four colleges and handling it pretty decently I thought except at the very end he said that if colleges don't want to help us out while we were still changing the world the implication being the colleges were rejecting him for his political viewpoint which is just asinine ok cottages I promise you the colleges that rejected David Hogg did so long before this happened ok right now if David Hogg were to reapply probably half the colleges that didn't let him in would let him in now Hogg said I mean he said in the interview I believe that he has a 4.1 GPA and a 1270 1270 SAT which is a fine score that is not the average score of the people getting into UCLA I know that my sister didn't get into UCLA and she had well into the 1300s in about a 4.1 GPA so again there there plenty of reason neutral rationales for why Hogg didn't get into these particular colleges and it has nothing to do with him being stupid or anything he's not stupid he's obviously again for the 1,000th time a smart kid but there are lots of reasons why you wouldn't get into UCLA with the 1270 with the 1270 average I mean with a 1270 SAT in fact I want to look up right now the average SAT score for UCLA at Middies it is it is certainly not a 1270 right now it it let's see so let's see I'm looking at preps caller.com so according to their admission statistics the average SAT score average SAT score composite at UCLA is thirteen seventy right a full 100 points higher than then David Hogg so that's why I didn't get in UCLA it's very selective college doesn't mean he's not gonna go to college he will go to college but watch this clip where Allison camerota demonstrates that now the media views these kids as cult figures cult figures right it's not if anybody if anybody crosses David Hogg it's not because maybe there's a reason that they did so like a value neutral they don't hate David Hogg reason it must be because they hate David hog and hate his agenda I mean this this clip from cammarata just says so many things in so little time let's play it David I am stunned that four colleges rejected you what kind of dumb colleges don't want you I mean you've taken the country by storm okay this is this is insane okay what kind of dumbass colleges would reject you how about colleges that were like just looking at his scores before any of this started but again treating these kids as totems is what this is all about this is all about treating these kids as totems and then suggesting that anyone who crosses these kids must be cast out in in sackcloth and ashes even though they're UCLA administrators who are leftist okay I know the administrators at UCLA they are leftists this is so silly by the way if you think the david hog is a victim of the colleges forget about what happened to parkland if you think that a white middle class kid upper middle class kid from from parkland Florida hey sis white male right a white privileged kid according to it let's put this right if Kyle if the shooting had not taken place in parkland and they were talking right now about the admissions for this guy would they really be suggesting that the colleges had discriminated against him or would they suggest that if he got into UCLA he'd be taking a spot that better go to an ethnic kid with a bad background with a hard background apparently sis privilege goes right out the window as soon as a political agenda is at stake this is about the media it really isn't about these kids these kids are saying what they're saying because they're on camera and because they're kids and I don't blame them for that I do blame the media for for making them totems that can never be crossed under any circumstances okay so yesterday I had the opportunity to sit down with Thomas ol and I wanted to bring that to you because it was really cool Thomas soul is of course one of the foremost economists in America he's it thinker and more importantly Thomas soul is I think a a real ethical guide for a lot of folks because he thinks about issues rational he has a brand new book out I had a chance to sit down with him yesterday here's what it sounded like welcome to the show Thomas Sol the leading economist in the United States and one of the great thinkers of the modern American scene has a brand new book out it's called discrimination and disparities I had the pleasure of reading it over the last couple of weeks I've actually referenced it at least twice on the show since I read it I think it's quite brilliant professor solo thanks so much for joining us so let me let me start with what I think is the most important part of the book you make an argument with regard to the definition of discrimination because people tend to lump all sorts of discrimination together you talk about discrimination 1 1 B and discrimination - can you just explain what those are and what the difference is between them yeah people who have discriminating tastes meaning that they are very good at comparing things and making decisions accordingly discrimination 2 means almost the opposite namely that once you've identified someone's identity then that person's individual qualities don't matter you will treat them negatively but on the basis of that and it's discrimination - that it discriminate anti-discrimination laws have been passed to deal with and discrimination 1 B is a different type of discrimination that you discuss as well this would be the use of group data in order to make individual decisions in the absence of individual information is that right that's right criminais ssin 1 a would be judging each person as individual 1 B would be judging individuals by the group that they come from in the absence of hi call information that we have a prohibitive call and the reason that distinction is so important you talk about it in the book is because what people tend to do is lump all of these things together so if you for example our taxi driver in New York City and there's a higher crime rate in the black community and so you don't pick up a particular black customer people accuse you of being a racist as opposed to simply you're using the information available to you and the proper solution to that would be the uber or lyft solution where you can actually profile the criminal backgrounds and potential customers presumably yes black taxi drivers do that white taxi driver so professor so one of the things that's great about the book and I think the most important thing is that you point out that just because there are disparities between racial groups which is of course the most important thing people talk about in the country that doesn't necessarily mean that there's some sort of vicious discrimination going on there could be an informational based discrimination one be going on there could be a behavioural discrimination type one going on how is it that we should approach separating out the types of discrimination that are that are really insidious from from the other types of discrimination when we just see a headline in the newspaper that says black folks have fewer homes than white folks or black folks are committing more crimes than white folks for example well I think the crucial implicit assumption is that in the absence of discrimination and in the absence of any genetic differences that people would be more or less randomly or equally spread out and therefore there wouldn't be these differences in point of fact there are innumerable differences one of the simplest ones that gets ignored all the time is that groups have different ages that is the Japanese Americans have a median age that is 20 years older than the median age of mexican-americans and so if you're talking about jobs that require you know either long years of education or 10 years of experience something like that then just the demographic differences means you have no chance from the outset even if Japanese Americans and Mexican Americans were absolutely identical with every other aspect and one of the things that this makes clear your discussion of this discrimination your book discrimination and disparities and the differences between groups one of the things this makes clear is that virtually all government programs that are directed at direct redistribution between groups are probably bound to fail because they're not taking into account the real reasons for the disparities in the first place so the book is discrimination and disparities professor so obviously is written a number of books I've recommended probably 10 to 15 books on the program already his latest is really timely and really effective professor so one final question for you because I know that we're a little short on time there wasn't your time study that came out a couple of weeks ago and the claim from the New York Times is that it showed that black boys particularly are facing discrimination in the United States that black girls are not and that among rich households even income is not a good predictor of future performance the suggestion from the New York Times that America is just more racist against black boys than black girls what was your take on that study if you had a chance to look at it but I see no reason whatever it wants you to expect boys and girls to behave the same any more than we would expect you know japanese-americans to be highly highly represented in baseball when when their median age was in the upper 40s again the book is discrimination and disparities professor song thanks so much for taking the time I really do appreciate it it's always a pleasure to have you tell he's an honor and we always appreciate that you take the time to be on the program oh thank you thanks so much well in just a second we are going to get to some some other issues with regard to how the left is utilizing power in order to keep conservatives out of media I haven't really discussed in depth a Kevin Williamson issue over at Lee Atlantic I want to talk about that a little bit plus I want to get to the your questions in the mailbag we'll do it a little bit early today but first I want to say thank you to a brand new sponsor okay these guys are awesome this is boro boro has reinvented the luxury couch from style to shipping functionality to adaptability Burrell has put the time and thought into buying furniture so you do not have to so here's how it works you go over to

is something they pitch bu rrow comm / ben shapiro 75 bucks off your purchase go check it out right now honestly really affordable fantastic furniture that's gonna last and it's easy to move it's just great check it out alright so if the laura ingraham boycott is really more about politics than it is about decency or civility which clearly it is i mean obviously this is about it's not about decency it's not about civility if it were then everybody would be saying okay Lord and I said what she said and David hog should not be saying what he says and by the way other folks should not be saying what they say so I want to show you some video of an actor who is attacking Laura Ingraham this guy is I'm trying to remember his name this is Michael Rapaport so you've seen him in you've seen him in in various TV shows you'll recognize he's well those guys we just recognize his face here he goes attacking Laura Ingraham is he gonna lose a single job for attacking a woman like this of course not here's Michael Rapaport Laura Ingraham the Fox News reporter you filthy Pig you dog-faced animal remember Laura Ingraham just a year ago at the Republican National Convention throwing up the Nazi salute look at this check this out look look at the Aryan pin-up girl and now Laura Ingraham dis Savage this dog this mutt and this has nothing to do with her looks it has to do with her behavior the things that she exudes she's a sweaty pig she's going after this high school student okay so this guy again was this about civility or decency I miss the part where this is about civility and decency because supposedly what great cinemas was not being civil to these kids right not being decent to these kids but this has never been about civility or decency this has always been about power and the use of power in order to shut down opposing points of view but people don't like what Laura had to say and so they're attacking Laura's business that's that's what they are doing right now and it really is pretty gross especially after she apologized but that's not unusual because what the less is also trying to do is say that Kevin Williamson can't work at the Atlantic so Kevin Williamson is very conservative he's libertarian in orientation he was also extraordinarily anti Trump like more anti Trump than anyone else probably on the right and the Atlantic decided to hire him away from national review hey and so what the left did is they dug through all the millions of words that he'd written and they found something they didn't like and they said he should not be allowed to write for our publications because that would just be terrible there are two op-eds out today about Kevin Williamson and the Atlantic from left as saying here's why Kevin Williamson should not be allowed to write for us now the only people that the left will accept writing for them are people who openly disagree with large planks of the Republican platform and the conservative platform at this point first of all if you voted for Trump forget it you will never work for a mainstream publication it's just not going to happen even the supposedly conservative people who work for the mainstream publications our conservatives who do not who did not vote for Trump right those people are welcomed into the into particular circles in the mainstream media specifically because they didn't write Bret Stevens can write for The Wall Street Journal and then move over to the New York Times the New York Times says it's okay for him to be over there because he didn't vote for Trump obviously even Bret Stevens was ripped up and down for being too conservative they're doing the same thing to Kevin Williamson over at the Atlantic even though he's the biggest Trump critic in the world Michelle Goldberg who writes for the New York Times even though she's egregiously awful I mean all of her columns are just sheer garbage here here's what she writes although I'm a squishy hearted liberal I have a soft spot for dyspeptic reactionaries like HL Mencken and V s Naipaul men they're almost always men speak to a dark misanthropic corner of my soul thus I've occasionally read Kevin Williamson a truly vicious but sometimes bracing writer when he was at National Review where his words resonated with me it would make me aware of hidden currents of cruelty in my own thinking I grew up in a conservative Rust Belt suburb and hated it and I loathe populist sanctimony that treats my stultifying hometown is more authentically American than the vibrant city I escaped to so I feel a guilty shudder of satisfaction reading williamson's vituperative 2016 attack on his functional small towns that supported Donald Trump the way williamson's contempt spoke to me made me think about how my fury over Trump's rise in my devotion cosmopolitanism was curdling into the very elitism people like me are constantly accused of the ability to prompt such an comfortable self recognition is a good quality and a polemicist so I almost understand why the Atlantic magazine seeking to add a provocative right-wing voice to its Russ roster recently hired Williamson okay there isn't so in other words she likes Williamson because she realized that Williamson is evil and when she reads Williams and agrees with him it's because she was realizing her own evil great way to start a piece there Michele yeah you're obviously very into ideological diversity at the Atlantic and then she goes on and describes white as the William shouldn't be at once and shouldn't be allowed to work for the Atlantic she says it's just terrible they've done the same thing now to Barry Weiss at the New York Times they've done the same thing too to various other conservatives who've been hired by mainstream at publications it's just it's it's just absurd it's just absurd and there's another piece in The Huffington Post that is called bad ideas aren't worth debating with a giant picture of course of Kevin Williamson and talking about how nobody who has ever had a bad idea should ever be allowed to write for an institution like the Atlantic now listen if the Atlantic wants to be left wing National Review that's fine but the Atlantic is trying not to do that they are purporting to be a in house an in-house place for very for a variety of opinion for various modes of debate hey listen I'm not hiring anybody on the left over it daily we're but we're very clear about that right it's not ideological because it's ideological like I'm not gonna hire tonic ICI coats over here at the Daily wire

largest fastest growing conservative show in the nation all righty so let's jump into the mailbag so David says dear friend from what abend from one fan to another happy opening day what is your realistic expectation for the White Sox this year well I'm excited enough about my White Sox this year that I actually went out and got a subscription to MLB TV and I watched their opening day game in the background while I did my work they hit six home runs yesterday Matt Davidson had three in one game which is just awesome realistically maybe an outside shot at the wild-card maybe I think maybe eighty eighty-five wins yeah maybe they get day 87 win something like that that's if everything goes right if everything goes wrong then in two years the limit world series because they have a really good young core they have a bunch of players who are coming up from the minors but their team that's probably two years away but teams that have been two years away have outperformed before look at the Houston Astros who weren't really expected to win anything until maybe a couple of years from now although Sports Illustrated had it right on the money Tyler says how do you atone for sins and Judaism big fan so okay so here's how you atone for sins in Judaism you tone really I mean we have like an entire day for it it's called Yom Kippur where we spend the entire day fasting and praying to God to atone now if you sin between yourself another human being you have to ask those other human beings for forgiveness okay and you have to ask them three separate times at least before God can even consider whether he ought to forgive you you ask for forgiveness every day three times a day in Judaism so you know before I come into the show I dive in what's called chakras ok chakras is the morning service and in that service there's an entire paragraph in what's called the silent I me now there's part of the service that's silent you stand there and you're talking directly to God it's kind of the most intimate part of the service and there's part called slackline whoo right it's all about God forgiving us okay we do that three times a day so Judaism is all about the forgiveness and the way you are forgiven is you have to also commit to not make the same mistake again so it's not enough to just say Christianity is the same way as I understand it it's not enough to say I'm sorry for that bad thing that I did you also said that you also have to say I understand my sin I'm not gonna do that again in order for God to consider it Justin says dear Ben what would you think about a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz primary Trump in 2020 if Trump doesn't get his act together I think that the possibility of a of a primary against a sitting US president is very very risky for the party I think that it probably tears the party apart I don't see any of those people beating Trump in a primary I think they know that which is why they're not going to try it but a lot can happen between now and 2020 if Trump turns out to be total disaster if things really go to hell in a handbasket then maybe you could see a real primary I mean you saw that in 1968 among Democrats between LBJ and Eugene McCarthy and in various other folks so you could see something like that right the that's why RFK was was expected to be the nominee in 1968 after LBJ bowed out but Trump would have to be a lot worse than he's been if he's just governs like he has so far there's not gonna be any primary Nicholas says I've heard the argument while while debating why health care shouldn't be considered right that just as the government grants you the right to a legal counsel it could grant you the right to the services of a health care professional is that an appropriate analogy or if it fails in what respects so number one the idea here is that when the government arrests you the government has now placed an onus on you to go to court the government does not place an onus on you D at health care that is your decision and it's not your decision whether you go to court it is your decision whether you're gonna get health care and it should be on your dime whether you get health care and there is some significant argument in legal history in the United States as to whether right to counsel means that I have to provide you counsel in my opinion it probably doesn't it probably means that I have the right to hire a counsel all right the public expense doesn't require that we go out and hire you a counsel but you know if we are going to hire your counsel the reason for that is because we have put you in the system not through any willpower of your own and that means we at least have to provide you with enough of a defense that you can defend yourself that's not the same thing as health care where it is up to you whether you want a doctor or not well and then this letter continues and says also I've heard you argue the health care as a private domain and they're sure therefore should be kept in the hands of individuals but there are certain externalities when it comes to contagious diseases does that warrant the government's involvement yes I mean it depends on the level of the contagion but yes this is why I'm in favor of mandatory vaccinations actually it's one of the areas where I have significant differences with some more libertarian minded folks in the in the Republican party because vaccinations do have externalities libertarians don't suggest that you can't regulate for externalities by the way Jeffrey says Ben Congrats on landing the radio gay got an important question though how will this affect the podcast will continue as is and the radio show be a separate thing or will be the pot will podcast be a rebroadcast of the radio show well actually the opposite so we're doing something brand new in radio history and that is the podcast is the podcast and then later we take it and reformat and we use it for radio so the podcast will sound exactly like it always has nothing changes about how you access the podcast or how it sounds it is not radio that is just you know repackaged into podcast form with commercial breaks cut out thing like that it is the podcast how it sounds today is how it will sound next week is how it will always sound mark says God Emperor Shapiro why I can't believe that I rested the title away from Clavin I recall in an episode of the conversation he said Woodrow Wilson was likely the most damaging president in history can you elaborate on why that is I said the Woodrow Wilson was one of them probably James Buchanan obviously up there LBJ is up there Woodrow Wilson was seriously damaging because he completely shifted the way that people thought about the workings of American government so before Woodrow Wilson American government had based on foundational principles like eternal immutable rights protected by limited government that's what America was about Woodrow Wilson based on the thoughts of German progressivism literally writing about Woodrow Wilson this week in my book Woodrow Wilson thought completely differently he thought that the Declaration was antiquated there was no such thing as an immutable right as an unalienable right instead there were just wise men in the bureaucracy who could decide for you how to live right and that the president ought to be as big a man as possible it's a direct quote from Woodrow Wilson in order to sort of embody the general will this Russo Lee in general well that unfortunately has become the way the government is done okay the idea of foundational limited government that protects your immutable rights that has gone by the wayside and the idea of a bureaucratic regime run by the wisest and best among us has taken hold among entirely the Democratic Party and probably large swathes of the Republican Party as well he's really damaging that way also his his intervention in World War one was was late or he shouldn't have done it you know but in any case is there their questions about when we should have intervened in World War one let's put into that and the way that he used World War one as a club to who to club his political opponents into submission is pretty incredible go read liberal fascism by jonah goldberg he talks at length about the fact that Woodrow Wilson came very close to being the first fascist president in the history of the United States John says Ben do you still have time to play the violin how the answer is lately no cuz I've been practice traveling so much but I did get myself an amazing violin so I don't spend a lot of money I'm pretty frugal but I went out and I splurged I got myself a really really nice violent and this thing is magnificent and I have a nice piano in my house a grand piano my dad plays piano so he comes over we play Brahms together so the answer is yes he'll one of my dreams we're trying to make it happen I want to play Brahms with Condoleezza Rice I just think this would be an amazing life experience I loved interview or two but had more being more interested in playing Brahms because she's a really good pianist and I'm a pretty good violinist Blake says hi Ben what are your thoughts on Crowder's impression of you and well I think that Crowder makes me out to be a little less personable than I am in his impression but let's put it that way I'm a little bit hee-hee his impression is sort of on the autism spectrum is that fair mathis yeah yeah I think that that's sort of that sort of what he does but it's it but I get a kick out of it I think that Crowder is hysterical and I think when he makes fun of me and does all of his parodies I yeah crowd was really nice about this he always lets me know that he's gonna do these parodies beforehand and gets my permission said he's not saying anything that I would find offensive and invariably I would do whatever he wanted I trust you you're really funny Josh does hey man there's a fellow comic book fan what are your top three comic book movies of all time I thought you gonna say comic books of all time which we can do another time top three comic book movies of all time well I mean all three of the Batman movies all the reading the Nolan movies but others that are in the mix I really liked the original Superman x-men first class is really excellent try and remember some of the others that are good I think you'll put Logan up near the top I did like Logan but I liked the first 2/3 of it a lot I saw the last third of it sort of fell apart mmm there's so many of them now it's hard for me to come up with my list I actually did come up with a list at one point I'll have to look it up but I believe that that was something close to the list by the way I like Black Panther a lot I mean I told you that I didn't like the politics of it but I thought it was really well made in compelling Bailey says what is your favorite part of Passover mine is always tricking the kids into eating lots of horseradish thanks Amaya that's pretty brutal my friend you know drinking kids into you know if you've ever eaten raw horseradish that sucker burns the favorite part of Passover the whole thing is great for kids it's designed for kids because the whole thing is how do you teach children and the way that you teach children is through ritual and questioning so this morning we we burned the huh made so this is a one of the Jewish rituals where you you do a ceremonial thing you clean out your entire house so you don't have any more leaven right I'm Passover because when the Jews left Egypt they didn't have time to let the bread rise and it was matzah and so they just left matzah that's why we eat matzah on Passover that's the story so what we do is we clean our house of all eleven and then we take the night before we do kind of a final check of the house for 11 and then we burn it the next morning to signify that we've done completed the task so this morning my kids were very into that we took them out into the side of the house and we and we burned the 11 there was a nice big fire and they were totally into the fire my son he's just getting to speak full sentences and I think his first full sentence came out this morning and it was something like I really like the fire it's nice and I thought oh that's not great but is it but he's my son is very end of the ritual Judaism is very much about ritual it's one of the things I like about Judaism I think that religion Sonde's ritual actually it's hard to train people to be better people without ritual right Aristotle says this and Judaism takes it to its extreme I think I think that the ritual is great obviously the Haggadah the the retelling of the Passover story is very much based on asket having kids ask questions right the four questions that are asked them on each trial how's that that whole thing I think you may have heard of before they my four girl daughters gonna sing that tonight it's really cool Alex says who is more of a conservative Churchill or Reagan well it depends it in which in which kind of mode you're talking in terms of foreign policy they were probably equivalently conservative Churchill hated the Communists he hated the Nazis Reagan hated the communists in terms of domestic policy Reagan was much more conservative than Winston Churchill because America is much more conservative generally than Great Britain let's see Dillon says what is the legal argument for allowing certain religious groups to defy the law while disallowing it for others I'm in favor of religious liberties but if we allow one group to go against the law says a law what is stopping another group from citing that case is a reason to do whatever they want to do ie the case of the Little Sisters of the Poor fighting Obamacare birth control rules and then another group wanting to hold group marriages and/or child marriages these are just examples maybe of better ones from more apt comparison so this is a serious question it's one of the reasons why I actually believe that religious liberty is protected by broader Liberty so to take an example right now there are a lot of people who are talking about the fact that your here's a perfect example of what you're talking about that people are asking about so you say a religious bakery doesn't have to cater to a same-sex wedding or doesn't have to serve gay people or something so based on religious exceptions okay but what if that person wanted to what wasn't religious and they just wanted to turn down service to a black person so my feeling is you can turn down service to whomever you want this is not a religious question it's a liberty question right religious liberty is protected not because we have to have specific carve outs but because the government should be so small and so non intrusive that religious people be allowed to live their lives just like secular people I don't think that the Constitution was designed to discriminate in favor of exceptions for religious people over secular people I think the Constitution was designed to protect against encroachment on Liberty by the government against anyone religious or secular the smaller the government the less the chance that the government is actually going to encroach on Liberty so what I would say is freedom of association is the issue with regard to Christian Baker's not freedom of religion I've said this many times on the program but okay Nathaniel says been regarding the Second Amendment by the way just quick note on that this does not mean that I think every aspect of discrimination is good I think many much discrimination is is totally morally wrong that doesn't mean the government gets to crack down on it we all discriminate in our lives in various ways good and bad I'm not sure that it's the government's role to determine how I run my business with regard to my clientele especially because the market tends to take care of me if I am too discriminatory and too awful Nathaniel's was bent regarding the Second Amendment I find it concerning that US citizens aren't allowed more freedom in their choice of guns for protection for example how can well our militia defendants nation against a tyrannical government that used weapons of mass destruction if the citizens only have AR so this is a question that's very often asked by the left saying well if you say that the purpose of the Second Amendment was to protect against government tyranny shouldn't everybody have a Tang shouldn't everybody have an f16 shouldn't everybody have a gun no okay the idea here is that you need the weaponry that is sufficient to deter government tyranny and if it came down to it by the way small arms are a capable deterrent against even the most major weaponry because if the less if the United States government has to legitimately nuke the state of Texas that war is never happening it's just not happening okay so there's that also the the militia the Texas State National Guard I believe probably would have access to nuclear weapons so there's that as well but as far as private ownership of firearms the point of private ownership of firearms is to deter potential conflicts just like the point of having nuclear arsenals that you never have to use it Nikolas says hi Ben my name is Nick I had a quick question on how to combat those at my university who used the argument of look at all the other countries who have gun control we need to try it how does one respond when all the left wants to do is compare the u.s. to Europe regardless of the topic here's what you should say you should say okay fine how about we look to Europe for guidance on abortion America has significantly less restrictive abortion laws than much of Europe abortion is banned in the second two trimesters in virtually every European country and its ban across the board in several European countries so it's they're pretty selective about when they want to copy Europe and when they don't I'm not a fan of copying Europe because I think Europe has gotten it all wrong for a for a fair bit of time I think that the last century and a half should show us that Europe is not worth is not worth imitating now Amy says hi Ben I grew up Christian but identify as agnostic now I have a young son and really like the Christian community and moral messages taught in the church I'd like my son to be introduced to Christianity for those reasons and I'm considering going back to church but I don't want to be a non-believing interloper do you think would be okay to take him to church even if I may not believe everything myself yes I think you should I think you should absolutely take your son to church I think social fabric is important I think teaching your son is important now I think that you should decide what you want to teach your kid I would not teach my kid agnosticism because I think that agnosticism is is the idea that you don't know whether God is there is something even religious people feel right religious people wonder whether God is there and knows what he's doing but you have to decide what you want to teach your kid don't don't confuse your kids don't bring them to church and then take them home and say everything you're learning in churches bunk but I like the I like the social programs now figure out what you want to teach your kid and then live along those lines but I think that church is the number one social fabric builder in the United States and the fact that we've lost that social fabric is contributing to the dis is contributing to two serious problems among individuals and communities as well okay so now time for a couple of things that I like and a couple of things that I hate so things that I like let's let's do that so a couple number one I want to recommend dennis prager his new book that comes out on Monday we were gonna do an interview this week we just ran out of time I wanted to a full hour interview with Dennis about his new book his new book is a commentary on the Bible and it's and it's really fabulous it's called Exodus God slavery and freedom and it's the rationale Bible right it's it's an amazing thing that Dennis got this done he literally takes exodus verse by verse and then he breaks down what he thinks is the logic and the reason behind it and I have some arguments with Dennis on some of this stuff but it's really deeply researched it's really well done and it's worth reading you should put it by your bed stand and you should read a little bit of her and I don't bank a better person then this is a really profound thinker and he's writing about the greatest document in the history of civilization so it is this is why we're getting a go pre buy it now and you'll get it you know in the middle of Passover if you're Jewish and just after Easter if you're not so dennis prager or if you're not Christian then you'll get it in the middle of your regular week dennis prager it's again the name of the book is Exodus gods slavery and freedom go check it out on Amazon okay other things that I like since since tonight begins the holiday of Passover I think that now is a good time to to use the best Exodus music ever no it's not from the Prince of Egypt although there's some really good numbers in the Prince of Egypt maybe we'll have to play one next week I think next Monday I'll do some some Prince of Egypt particularly the opening number deliver us is fantastic in Prince of Egypt but we'll start the the Exodus feel with the actual theme you move music from the movie Exodus the movie in that great but the theme music Stan tastic and and here's what the theme to the movie Exodus sounds like it's by Ernest gold it's it's a beautiful theme the movie of course is not actually about the biblical Exodus it's about the it's about the formation of the State of Israel based on the Leon URIs novel of the same name which is a really good novel so check that out check out the novel rather than the rather than the movie because the novel is much better and the obvious connections between Passover and the foundation of the State of Israel are clear and obvious the entire I mean the the Seder finishes with us shouting next year in Jerusalem the reason being the longtime hope of the Jewish people has always been a Jewish state in Jerusalem and that has not changed throughout history that is the biblical hope always right okay time for a couple of things that I hate so everybody's been praising Rosanna that's all fine and good I protect Rosanna a little bit earlier this week but I just want to point out that if people really believe that the folks who make rows down the folks in Hollywood have suddenly warmed and are being nice to trump supporters that's a bunch of nonsense here's one of Roseanne stars talking about why people voted Trump it is not it is not nice can't understand it don't know where it comes from other than you know being I think it's a it's a couple of issues it's being either under the thumb of your husband or it's in it for the election that was being so offended by Hillary Clinton and and Bill Clinton's legacy that you turned on her or feeling inadequate feeling like how can somebody be so educated how could somebody have brought themselves up from their own experience and and and you know gone to the top educated herself fought for you know for rights civil rights and equality and I think that's threatening to a lot of women okay this is just absurd the idea that women are jealous of Hillary Clinton I promise you there's not a married woman in America who's jealous of Hillary Clinton's marriage that's not the way that works but again just the idea that Hollywood has suddenly warmed a Trump supporters is a bunch of nonsense that Sandra Bernhard of course who's a wild Lefty okay other things that I hate so next week they're releasing Chappaquiddick okay this movie I've already seen it is phenomenal it's a very very good movie and it is not conspiratorial in any way it's a straight retelling of what happened at Chappaquiddick with Ted Kennedy it's an amazing thing that this thing got made in the first place but there's a story from variety saying that that there was push back when they first tried to produce the film Byron Allen his enter studio entertainment studios CEO he said unfortunately there are some very powerful people who tried to true who tried to put pressure on me not to release this movie they went out of their way to try and influence me in a negative way I made it very clear I'm not about to right I'm not about to left I'm about the truth this is true about this movie this movie is not political this is not a rip on Ted Kennedy okay it actually makes Ted Kennedy look somewhat sympathetic even though Ted Kennedy acted like just an enormous piece of garbage but it doesn't go over the rails either it doesn't it doesn't make him out to be an innocent it so show that he was manipulative and being manipulated it shows that he was that but but it does not paint him in a completely unflattering light now there's a lot to this movie I'm gonna say my full analysis in the movie for next week I got to see a screener of it it's it's really really well-made it's really well made and they're very careful to only stick with the facts cuz after watching the movie I thought well they didn't include this and this and this and then I look back and I looked at the evidence I said well they did include that cuz it was a rumor they didn't include rumors right like all the stuff about him having an affair with Mary Jo there's no proof of that so that's not in the movie what it does show is him leaving Mary Jo there to drown right so there's a lot to the movie the fact that Hollywood want to shut it down again Hollywood is a lefty town do not trust them to tell conservative stories without resistance certainly and this is not a conservative story it's much more an objective take on what happened with Kennedy is just amazing that it took what that haven't in 69 so it took them 40 49 years to do that all took was half a century for them to get around to one of the worst political scandals in the history of the United States well done Hollywood all right so we will be back here next week and we will be doing so in we're excited to launch the podcast and a bunch of radio station so tell your parents to look out for it or to listen to it on radio as well we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation and now we're bring it to radio
