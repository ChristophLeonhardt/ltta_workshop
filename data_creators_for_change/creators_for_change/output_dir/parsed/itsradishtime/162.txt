miss de tu I hope you can hear me we
were road sounds
I have work today to go to Chicago so I
to Center
state of Illinois got
coming up
I'll talk about what I'm doing here
later I guess
hate pain tolls but the Illinois told
people are always like the friendliest
people around like I've got imagined
that job sucks but they are always the
nicest people so good job Illinois
me and I should probably go this isn't
safe
now that I am out of imminent danger
I am time to Chicago about a two and a
half three hour drive from where I live
I ain't driving as I've said before in
this channel so like whenever i am going
somewhere
not close with anybody I do not drive
today I'm going alone
be like sitting in a car and just like
waiting to be somewhere
no how you guys keep yourself
entertained on like road trips or long
car rides I haven't listened to podcasts
I burned six of them
two CDs to get
through this ride I got
roaming pod to catch up on and cereal
this very compliant which is like
intrigued about a murder so that kind of
makes the time go a lot faster for me
even listening
but still a high important and I need
driving so what do you do or like what
podcasting listen to as I could probably
stay
to get more going
otherwise the other thing that I do if I
have to go somewhere is take the train
or a bus or something I used to always
take the bus from a distance walk or
take the train from walk in Chicago
that is just so much better because even
though you have to pay for it I mean you
don't have to pay for gas and and you
like we get work done at a video right
stop I wrote so many papers on the bus
but there is no good train from Chicago
to Madison which is like unacceptable
there should be no reason no reason
there's a bus but it only runs like a
few times a day so I'd have to leave it
like nine morning and then get home at
like nine at night which is not
happening so public transports really
the way to go I think it's the wave of
the future there should be trains
running everywhere I have no idea why we
all put up with this car all right
so I'm heading back from Chicago I just
got done getting some head shots taken
and that I went shopping at of papers to
work because we don't have it Madison
now traffic is like just kind of picking
up so I will be driving for another like
two and a half
I talk
nicest free
people all right so it's real dark
welcome to the Sun
I
hey
but not for nothing I've actually had a
really fun day
my apartment like
it was a lot of fun too
go and get all the stuff done and have a
little adventure
kind of like traveling alone like
whatever went to VidCon by myself
it's kind of nice reminder that you as
an individual
do things on your own and be cool
experience fun things and
alright guys so I just got home
basically been gone like eight hours
today most of them driving because i was
just doing like a one hour thing but
like tons of errands got done and the
important thing is that now i have a
falafel to eat so I'm going to go edit
this now and i'll see you tomorrow bye
