Russia's medical community has been outraged by a criminal case brought against a Moscow Hermit ologist she's accused of medical malpractice that allegedly led to a patient's death but many doctors and legal and analysts claim the case is significantly flawed artis Ilya patron Co has the details it was dr. Yelena Mazur Donna's job to come to this clinic every day and work to save people's lives she was the mastermind behind this brand-new unit which was meant to become the most advanced Center for bone-marrow transplants in Moscow the plan was to open it in January but instead a court ruled that she must go to jail this is Miss Serena's office she has been gone for two weeks already we miss her she had a lot of plans and there are assignments for the next week on her desk it all goes back to a tragedy that happened almost five years ago she was treating a patient with leukemia and that required a morning biopsy a routine procedure for dr. Massoud innum it all went fine and the patient went off to work by evening he was suffering severe stomach pains and an ambulance took him to a private hospital then he underwent surgery and in two days passed away if a patient dies his or her relatives always want to get justice when someone's life has taken do to somebody else I think that some punishment must follow but what caused the person's death the biopsy the surgery or something else it took the investigators in the court for years to determine that for now the verdict is that this office will remain empty for two years but some of Russia's top hematologists called the ruling nonsense while dr. Massoud and his colleagues and former patients were simply stunned now I feel that future is being taken away from the person who saved my life and lives of many others that's unfair I am here and Amy Serena yeah every scene medic understood that a person who fooled served to be acquitted was being put behind bars and that means all of us doctors may end up in prison we're all yearly on the Miss su Donna if we get punished just for following correct procedures then we'll be afraid to do our jobs as doctors the support campaign online is gathering pace with Aegis we stalled hashtag I'm unanimous ood in the social network posts profile pictures being changed daily so did you know that in the courtroom after she was already handcuffed the last thing she said to her husband was not about her child but about our patience she asked that they be taken care of so a doctor who was already convicted who should have been angry had not cared was still thinking about her patients we've tried to get a comment from the private clinic that carried out the surgery following the biopsy and the stomach pains but they are refusing to talk to journalists though in their online press statement the clinic stands by its doctors and their work the case is so controversial tragic and has grabbed so much attention the authorities are scratching their heads over what to do with it I do not know all the details of that case I think it's the courts business and if necessary there can be a follow up to find out if there's a link between the doctors actions and the death of the patients the staff at this clinic they want justice to prevail so as the relatives of the patient who want the person responsible punished we might never find the truth but after talking to people who work at this clinic I believe there's little doubt that experts should be given another chance to look at this case
