1
00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:04,796
HOW CAN YOU BE SO POLITICALLY

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,766
STUPID TO LET YOUR POLITICAL

3
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:09,500
OPPONENT WRAP MS-13 AROUNDNER

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,906
NAOEK?-- AROUND THEIR NECK.

5
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:15,873
>> Sandra: THE PRESIDENT WILL

6
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:17,709
SIGN A BILL TODAY AND YOU'LL BE

7
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:18,409
THERE FOR IT.

8
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:20,044
WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT

9
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,245
THIS LEGISLATION TODAY?

10
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,114
>> IMAGINE THAT YOU WENT TO

11
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:24,749
YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND WERE

12
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:26,150
GIVEN A TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS.

13
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,552
YOU HAVE A TERMINAL DISEASE

14
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:29,187
YOU'LL DIE FROM FOR WHICH THERE

15
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:30,154
IS NO CURE.

16
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:32,023
IMAGINE GETTING THE SAME

17
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,424
DIAGNOSIS BUT THEN FINDING OUT

18
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:34,859
THAT THERE IS A PROMISING CURE

19
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,461
FOR THAT DISEASE THAT IS IN

20
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:37,629
CLINICAL TRIALS RIGHT NOW BUT

21
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:39,030
YOU CAN'T GET ACCESS TO IT

22
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,298
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

23
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:41,466
IS BLOCKING YOUR WAY.

24
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,267
THAT HAPPENS TO THOUSANDS OF

25
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:44,202
AMERICANS EVERY YEAR.

26
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:45,036
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SIGNING

27
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:47,472

00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:48,673
LAW TODAY WHICH GIVES TERMINAL

29
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,941
PATIENTS THE RIGHT TO TRY TO

30
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,143
SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES.

31
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:53,077
IN MANY STATES YOUR VIEWERS

32
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:55,913
HAVE HEARD OF RIGHT TO DIE LIES

33
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:57,115
WHICH GIVE TERMINAL PATIENTS

34
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:00,318
THE RIGHT TO END THEIR LIVES.

35
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:03,588

TREATMENT AND HAVE EXHAUSTED

38
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,526
ALL THOSE OPTIONS AND THERE IS

39
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,293
AN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT THAT

40
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:10,161
YOUR DOCTOR RECOMMENDS FOR YOU,

41
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,296
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE

42
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:13,464
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BEG THEM

43
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,099
FOR THE RIGHT TO TRY THAT.

44
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,501
FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT'S A

45
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,301
NO-BRAINER AND GOOD FOR

46
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,137
