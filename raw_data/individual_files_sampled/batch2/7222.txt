new reporting indicates that the chairman of Sinclair had spoken to Donald Trump himself last year and specifically spoke to him about certain business ideas that Sinclair has been pushing for Nelson Claire Broadcast Group is a right-leaning broadcast group that is also seeking to buy Tribune which would indicate if that merger is approved that Sinclair would own 75% of the news local news that gets broadcast throughout the country now that's a disastrous so let me just be clear 75 percent of the markets would have a Sinclair station so that they don't of course own all the stations in those markets but that is tremendous influence enormous influence in fact Trump's own team his own son-in-law Jared Kushner bragged after the election that they made a deal with Sinclair which actually gave them more access to the swing states almost ten times as much he said then CN n that's how much impact those local news stations have now I just learned about this technology that they've been pushing for it's technology that Sinclair has apparently developed and so here's what you should be concerned about moving forward now David D Smith who is the chairman for Sinclair said that he briefed officials last year on a system that would enable authorities to broadcast direct to any Americans phone apparently he was quoted as saying I just wanted them to be aware of the technology now this is technology that they have taken part in developing and so they want all new televisions that are built in the you know or that are built to include a certain chip that they've developed and it's part of the next-gen TV technology so I'll give you more details than that for that in a second he recalled an earlier meeting with Trump during the 2016 election campaign where he told the future president quote we are here to deliver your message well that seems very helpful to a politician doesn't it so they're outraged that they're getting criticism in the press about being mouthpieces for Trump and nothing more than that well yeah people are gonna think that and actually people know because you say things like we are here to deliver your message to Donald Trump so remember the the famous number that studies showed that Donald Trump had gotten about two billion dollars of free media coverage before the general election just in the primaries that's enormous whereas they hardly covered Bernie Sanders at all so these huge disproportionate free media advantage that Trump had that didn't include local stations so on top of that cable news coverage that Trump got for free and all the shots of the empty podium before he even showed up you had Sinclair going we are here to deliver your message sir so is the media partly responsible for electing Donald Trump absolutely clearly so so let's get to this technology that Sinclair is pushing for the company has been a driving force in the development of a new broadcasting standard known as next-gen TV and is one of the first involved in making chips for television cell phones and other devices to receive the new transmissions so they got together with their lobbyist friends and started lobbying the government specifically the FCC aggressively lobbying the FCC to ensure that all new televisions are built with this technology because guess what they will financially profit from that they're the ones who make these chips now what is next-gen TV well here's what we know so far apparently it's something it's it's a form of technology that will provide advanced emergency alerts so it would have it would be able to give you alerts on your phone on your television coming from the government so if the government wants to alert you regarding a natural disaster or some sort of threat they would be able to do that they would just kind of get in there and tell you what you need to know okay there's interactivity so the way that this would work is it would essentially give it would give advertisers the ability to give you targeted ads right because it would keep track of the types of ads that you choose to watch okay so there's that component of it there's the target advertising and also there are privacy concerns when it comes to these targeted ads so similar to what we're experiencing on Facebook right now some members of the FCC were concerned that we would have the same problem with our televisions now the FCC unfortunately did vote partly in favor of what Sinclair wants this was in late 2017 and they said that this technology should be voluntary for companies technology companies who wish to include it yeah so look a couple of different issues here one they're all all these media companies are driven to get better and better data on you to be able to serve you more ads so it is that what the industry does and so a huge problem that television has is that they don't have enough data so they do ratings based on well I think that TV was on at that time who was watching they don't really know and and I know that they're trying hard to find the right demos and give you the right ratings and information but online you have much better information you have arguably too much information as we saw from Facebook and the Cambridge analytical mess and so what they want to do is be able to track you better on TV as well that's exactly right so and partly by the way it's preposterous the televisions been getting all these ads for all this time and when you ask advertisers who are you reaching they're like oh then they turn to the internet and they know exactly what they're reaching and they're like I don't know I I'm sceptical I just want to put my money thank you you you got to the point that I was desperately wanting to get to right advertisers have still been incredibly I mean we know this we've talked about D monetization and and censorship and all that stuff pretty much non-stop since last week they're very finicky when it comes to online content and they have a lot more data regarding online content which demo is watching how long are they watching for those types of things how many of them actually click on the ad that pops up in a video they have way more data there with television they have less data which is why companies are now pushing for this technology that's more interactive so these you know advertising firms will have a better idea of what habits are so they can target these ads but like if they knew that online had better online content had better data for them then why had they been so finicky well yeah because people are slow they're conservative and not it politically but in by their nature and so they kept using an inferior technology so I don't mind the technology I get why people want to push in that direction but the idea of Sinclair having access to all that data is a little scary given their stated intentions and and how they don't appear to be doing news they appear to be doing propaganda to serve the president in in their own words and for them to me that of course always the most disturbing part is the fact that they can influence politicians by giving them campaign donations and doing all the lobbying and they go because of the influence of money in politics they could just say now use our technology instead of someone else's your technology better no but I bought the politicians so I'm gonna ask you to use my technology instead so that's a whole nother set of problems when you're looking for problems turn to Sinclair if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm slash joy
