1
00:00:00,674 --> 00:00:02,309
THESE WILL CONTINUE TO TRICKLE

2
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:02,576
IN.

3
00:00:02,576 --> 00:00:04,177
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:05,679
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS GOING

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,646
INTO DAYS HEARINGS WITH AN OPEN

6
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:07,381
MIND.

7
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:09,015
HE SAID YESTERDAY HE COULD

8
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:09,750
CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT KAVANAUGH

9
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,651
IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY.

10
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:13,053
THE HEARING WAS BARELY OVER WHEN

11
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,655
HE TWEETED HIS SUPPORT FOR HIS

12
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:15,956
PICK.

13
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:17,457
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON FOR

14
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:18,425
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION IS HERE

15
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:20,861
TO WEIGH IN ON HOW THINGS WENT

16
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:21,128
ON.

17
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:23,430
YOU WERE IN THE HEARING TODAY.

18
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,631
THERE WERE SOME BREAKS ALONG THE

19
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,632
WAY, AND WE HEARD THAT THERE

20
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:27,000
WERE CONCERNS OF THE WHITE HOUSE

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,302
ABOUT HOW CREDIBLE DR. FORD WAS,

22
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:30,671
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

23
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:32,539
POTENTIALLY AN INSURMOUNTABLE

24
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,807
PROBLEM FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

25
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:34,808
WHAT WAS THE MOOD IS THE DAY

26
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:36,343
WENT ON IF YOU CAN TELL US?

27
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,078
>> IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL DAY.

28
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,480
THAT WAS PROBABLE IN THE ROOM.

29
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,415
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SUMMED IT

30
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,816
UP BEST.

31
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:44,051
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT JUDGE

32
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,220
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, IT WAS

33
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,587
POWERFUL.

34
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:47,054
AND RIVETING.

35
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:47,454
AND HONEST.

36
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:49,089
I WAS SITTING THERE, SITTING TO

37
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:51,058
THE LEFT OF ME WAS A FORMER

38
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:52,826
GIRLFRIEND OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH

39
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:54,328
WHO KNOWS HIM VERY WELL, THERE

40
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:55,162
TO SUPPORT IT.

41
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:56,930
TO MY RIGHT WAS ALYSSA MILANO,

42
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,865
SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I

43
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:58,599
WOULD BE SAYING.

44
00:00:58,599 --> 00:00:59,533
PLATES BE NOT IN

45
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:00,768
A SENATE HEARING.

46
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:02,302
>> WITH HER IN MY LINE OF SIGHT,

47
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:03,837
I COULD SEE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S

48
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:05,138
PARENTS, WHICH WAS TOUGH TO

49
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,975
WATCH, TOUGH TO WATCH HIS MOM

50
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:09,410
WATCH HER SON UNDERGO THIS.

51
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,979
SHE WAS CHOKED UP A NUMBER OF

52
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:12,413
TIMES.

53
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:12,947
THAT WAS DIFFICULT.

54
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,783
BUT IT WAS CLEAR BY THE END OF

55
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,351
TODAY THAT WE REALLY LEARNED

56
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:17,751
NOTHING NEW.

57
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,255
WE STILL HAVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH

58
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:25,626
CATEGORICALLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY

59
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,862
DENYING DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS.

60
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:28,829
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

61
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:29,797
IT'S EVERYONE ELSE TO DESCRIBE

62
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:30,231
THE PARTY.

63
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,433
THIS IS NOT A HE SAID-SHE SAID

64
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:32,800
SITUATION.

65
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,102
THIS IS A SHE SAID VERSUS WHAT

66
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:35,936
FOUR PEOPLE HAVE SAID.

67
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,238
>> Shannon: DO YOU FEEL SHE

68
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:38,406
CAME ACROSS AS CREDIBLE?

69
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,673
>> SHE WAS SYMPATHETIC, THERE

70
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,041
WAS NO DOUBT IN MATT.

71
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,543
SHE WAS EARNEST BUT THERE WERE A

72
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:44,678
NUMBER OF INCONSISTENCIES IN HER

73
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:45,045
TESTIMONY.

74
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:46,514
FOR INSTANCE SHE SAID SHE COULD

75
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:48,449
NOT NAME THE HEARING THIS PAST

76
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:49,116
MONDAY AND HER ATTORNEY SAID

77
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,719
THAT WAS BECAUSE SHE HAS A FEAR

78
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,387
OF FLYING.

79
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:53,888
SHE SAYS THAT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT

80
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:54,989
HAPPENED IN THIS INCIDENT.

81
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,990
AND SO THEY ASKED FOR A FEW DAYS

82
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,960
SO THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO

83
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,995
DRIVE TO WASHINGTON, D.C., FROM

84
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,396
CALIFORNIA.

85
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:02,430
>> Shannon: FROM HER LEGAL

86
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,730
TEAM?

87
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,866
WE HEARD THE RUMORS AND I WASN'T

88
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,033
SURE THAT WAS COMING FROM.

89
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,235
>> YOU SPEAKER YOUR LAWYERS,

90
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:10,037
OBVIOUSLY, LEGAL TEAM.

91
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:10,738
SO IT TURNS OUT, SHE TOOK A

92
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:11,539
PLANE TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO

93
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,242
THE HEARING TODAY --

94
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,042
>> Shannon: ALSO TO

95
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:15,610
COSTA RICA.

96
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,612
>> SHE'S A WORLD TRAVELER.

97
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:18,413
SHE REGULARLY TAKES PLANES, SHE

98
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:27,088
CAN'T REMEMBER IF SHE SHOWED

99
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:27,789
"THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER

100
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:28,523
AT THE THERAPIST NOTES, A COUPLE

101
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:28,956
OF MONTHS AGO.

102
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:29,657
SHE ALSO SAID SHE WISHED THEY

103
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:30,358
COULD HAVE COME TO CALIFORNIA.

104
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,058
THEY BEING THE SENATE STAFF.

105
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:31,726
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY OFFERED A

106
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:32,427
NUMBER OF TIMES.

107
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:33,628
THE PUBLIC INFORMATION, THEY

108
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:34,829
OFFER TO GO OUT THERE.

109
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,296
THERE WERE GAPS.

110
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,030
>> Shannon: REALLY QUICKLY, I

111
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,299
WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS IDEA

112
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,033
THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAMMERED OVER

113
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,402
AND OVER AGAIN TO BRETT

114
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:42,804
KAVANAUGH SAYING, YOU ASKED THE

115
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,238
WHITE HOUSE TO GET THIS FBI

116
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:44,839
INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED.

117
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,307
HE SAID, I'LL DO ANYTHING THE

118
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:47,108
COMMITTEE WANTS ME TO DO.

119
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:49,043
THEY ARE SAYING, NO, WE WANT YOU

120
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,211
TO ASK IT UNTIL THE WHITE HOUSE

121
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,846
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.

122
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,348
WHY IS THAT NOT HAPPENING?

123
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,849
>> FROM THE WHITE HOUSE'S

124
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:55,950
VIEWPOINT, I THOUGHT THEY WERE

125
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,684
PUTTING JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN A

126
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,220
COMPLETELY UNFAIR POSITION.

127
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,388
IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU ARE

128
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,623
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

129
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:03,825
YOU DON'T DIRECT INVESTIGATIONS

130
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:04,525
INTO YOURSELF WHEN YOU ARE

131
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,360
SAYING I'M INNOCENT.

132
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,628
THIS BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

133
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:08,730
AS GOOD AS THE ME TOO MOVEMENT

134
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,565
HAS BEEN, ME TOO DOES NOT

135
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,000
REPLACE INNOCENT OF ALL PROVEN

136
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,333
GUILTY.

137
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,801
AS FAR AS THE FBI IS CONCERNED,

138
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,604
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A 36 YOUR

139
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:17,205
ALLEGATION.

140
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:18,106
IT'S KIND OF OUT OF THEIR

141
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:18,840
PURVIEW AT THIS POINT.

142
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,309
ALL THEY WOULD BE DOING IS

143
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:22,810
COMPILING STATEMENTS AND THOSE

144
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,645
STATEMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

145
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:24,679
COMPILED FROM THE KEY PEOPLE WHO

146
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,814
WERE THERE, PEOPLE WHO WERE

147
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,415
THERE WHO SAID THIS NEVER

148
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,016
HAPPENED.

149
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:28,683
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT.

150
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:30,251
>> Shannon: ONE OF THE KEY

151
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,853
PLAYERS BEFORE WE GO,

152
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:32,420
MARK JUDGE.

153
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,688
FORGIVE ME FOR READING MY

154
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:34,856
COMPUTER SCREEN, MIKE EMANUEL

155
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,257
GOT A LETTER THAT HE SENT TO THE

00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,258
COMMITTEE AGAINST INCOME HE

00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,298
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.

HE AVOIDS PUBLIC LEAVING, WE

162
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:46,301
WERE FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:47,535
HAVEN'T SPOKEN SEVERAL YEARS.

164
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:48,903
I DO NOT RECALL THE EVENTS

DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD IN HER
