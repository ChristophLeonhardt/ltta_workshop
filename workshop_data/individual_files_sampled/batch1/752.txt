the killing of Abdel Fattah al Sharif in Hebron in 2016 became one of the most controversial incidents involving Israel's army in recent years the reason the existence of this video showing soldier L or Azaria shoot al Sharif in the head as he lay on the ground which a military court said happened more than ten minutes after the Palestinian was first shot and disarmed while attempting a knife attack Azaria was released last month after spending nine months in jail a new bill awaiting consideration by Israel's Parliament the Knesset proposes a maximum ten years sentence for anyone recording similar videos the Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman tweeted his support saying IDF soldiers are subjected to attacks from those who act against the Israeli people and terror supporters who try to humiliate shame and harm them we will put an end to this the proposed law comes in response to a series of videos recently seen as harmful to the Israeli military's image the bill's wording though has been questioned it refers to the intent of the person recording a soldier's behavior being to injure their spirit or harm national security Israel's Attorney General has called the bill in its current form illegal if and when the bill does become Lords understood it would be in a very different form the maximum sentence reduced from 10 to 3 years the offense changed from filming or distributing images of soldiers to impeding them from carrying out their duty the head of the human rights group that circulated the Hebron video says that doesn't mean the bill is being watered down rather that it's being incorporated into existing law now they can actually shift the norm and create this gray area in which it would be under the capacity of you know random soldiers or commanders to just claim that almost any photography is somehow obstruction of soldier's ability to carry out their duties but Selim says the eventual law could be used against media organizations as well as activists and send a message to soldiers that they can treat those recording them more aggressively it wouldn't however apply in the case of this video of an Israeli snipers shooting an unarmed man near the Gaza border fence and the celebrations that followed it was taken by a fellow Israeli soldier the defense minister called for him to be punished under military law and for the sniper who fired the bullet to be awarded a medal Harry Fawcett al Jazeera West Jerusalem
