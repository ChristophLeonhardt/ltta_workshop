ABBY: WELCOME BACK.
A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN
PHILADELPHIA SPARKING
OUTRAGE FOR DISPLAYING
ANTI-NRA AND ANTI-G.O.P.
SIGNS.
THE SIGNS WERE COVERED UP
FOR ELECTIONS YESTERDAY.
BUT OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS THE
SIGNS MUST COME DOWN AND SO
DO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF
PENNSYLVANIA.
JOINING US NOW IS ERIN
ELMORE A FORMER TRUMP
CAMPAIGN SURROGATE AND NRA
MEMBER.
SHE PLANNED TO SEND HER SON
TO THE SCHOOL BUT HAS SINCE
DECIDED AGAINST THAT WELCOME
BACK TO THE SHOW.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
ABBY: YOU CAME ON A FEW
WEEKS AGO.
REMIND OUR AUDIENCE WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE AND WHY IS
THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR YOU.
>> I WAS WALKING PAST THE
SCHOOL WHERE MY SON WOULD GO
TO KINDERGARTEN NEXT YEAR
AND I SAW THESE SIGNS
ANTI-NRA AND G.O.P.
MESSAGES.
THIS IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL.
CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 5.
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NRA AND
G.O.P. IS.
ABBY: WHO IS PUTTING UP SOME
OF THE SIGNS.
>> ALLEGEDLY STUDENTS.
I THINK THEY WERE FORCED TO
DO SO.
AND, NO MATTER HOW YOU COME
OUT ON THIS POLITICALLY,
PHILADELPHIA HAS SOMETHING
LIKE A 70% HIGH SCHOOL
GRADUATION RATE.
THAT'S 10% BELOW THE
NATIONAL AVERAGE.
THESE KIDS NEED TO LEARN HOW
TO READ AND MATH AND
SCIENCE.
ALSO, WHY ARE WE
INDOCTRINATING OUR CHILDREN?
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE HATRED
IN THEIR HEARTS.
THEY SHOULD HAVE LOVE FOR
EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT
POLITICAL PARTY YOU BELONG
TO.
ABBY: NOW THE G.O.P., THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY OF
PENNSYLVANIA ARE GETTING
INVOLVED.
HERE IS WHAT THEY SAY IS
GOING ON AT THE SCHOOL.
THEY SAY YOUR HANDBOOK
SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT
SCHOOL PROPERTY AND
SCHOOLTIME MAY NOT BE USED
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.
WE REQUEST THE SCHOOL
DISTRICT IMMEDIATELY REMOVE
THOSE SIGNS SO THAT'S SORT
OF THE LATEST UPDATE IN WHAT
IS GOING ON.
HOW IS THE SCHOOL, DO YOU
THINK, GOING TO RESPOND?
>> HOPEFULLY THEY WILL
FOLLOW THAT EDICT AND TAKE
THE SIGNS DOWN.
I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO
SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL
HERE.
THEY ARE SAYING THINGS TO ME
NOW MY CHILDREN ARE UNSAFE
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS
GETTING DEATH THREATS AND
YOU ARE BRINGING THIS TO THE
FOREFRONT.
OF COURSE I'M SORRY I WANT
SAFE I LOVE MY FRIENDS AND
CHILDREN.
THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE
TEACHERS, 5, 6, 7,
8-YEAR-OLDS SHOULDN'T BE
ADDRESSING ADULT ISSUES LIKE
POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE
NRA.
THESE ARE ADULT ISSUES.
AND YOU HAVE TO REALIZE IF
YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE ON
ADULT ISSUES, YOU ARE GOING
TO HAVE ADULT CONSEQUENCES.
THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
ABBY: WHAT IF THE SIGNS WERE
SWITCHED.
PRO-NRA AND PRO-SECOND
AMENDMENT?
WOULD YOU BE OKAY.
>> I WOULD STILL BE PRETTYIA
LARMD.
I DON'T THINK KIDS OF ANY
AGE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT
THE ISSUES.
IF THEY ARE THEY SHOULD BE
TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE HOME
NOT A PUBLIC SCHOOL.
ABBY: WE WILL SEE HOW THIS
