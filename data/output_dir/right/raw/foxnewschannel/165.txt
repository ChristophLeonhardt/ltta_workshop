YOU KNOW, WE DEAL WITH BAD

00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:11,675
PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.

8
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:12,809
BUT THIS IS IN OUR FACE.

9
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,611
I FEEL PERSONALLY OFFENDED.

10
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:15,512
THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT

11
00:00:15,513 --> 00:00:16,346
CONTEMPT FOR US.

12
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:18,115
WHY WOULD YOU PUT A GUY LIKE

00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:20,350
BOX AFTER ALL THE PRESIDENT

00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:20,917
HAS DONE.

16
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:22,419
THIS GUY HAS GOT TO GO.

17
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,520
SAUDI ARABIA, IF YOU ARE

18
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,388
LISTENING, THERE ARE A LOT

19
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:25,622

00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:34,998
SENATOR, WHAT YOUR COLLEAGUE

HAS TO GO.

30
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:41,138

SO FAR LINDSEY HAS BEEN ON

39
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:54,050
THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IT'S

40
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:54,818
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

41
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:55,786
SAUDI ARABIA IS THE LARGEST

42
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,521
STATE SPONSOR OF RADICAL

00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,467
THEY ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS.

YEMEN, IT'S A CATASTROPHE, A

55
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:16,106
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER.

00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,375
THIS LATEST EPISODE KILLING

00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:19,676
A JOURNALIST IS JUST PROOF,

>> Neil: YOU WONDER FEN THIS

61
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,249
WE WOULD TAKE APART THE DEAL

62
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,751
THAT WE SCORED WITH THE

63
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:29,419
SAUDIS LAST YEAR

EXTRAORDINARY LEVERAGE OVER

PARTS.

78
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,804
THEIR AIR FORCE IS ENTIRELY

79
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:48,238
U.S. PLANES.

80
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,408
THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON US FOR

81
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,776
PARTS AND MECHANICS.

82
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:54,311
THEY ARE ENTIRELY DEPEND

WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT CHOPS

89
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:03,086
UP JOURNALISTS, PUTS THEM IN

90
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:06,089
LITTLE BAGS AND THEN ESCORTS

91
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,791
THEM OUT IN AN SUV AND DUMPS

92
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:08,692
THEM SOMEWHERE.

93
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:11,528
THIS IS NOT [INAUDIBLE]

94
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:11,895
BEHAVIOR.

95
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:14,364
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AROUND

96
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:17,000
THE WORLD -- WE HAVE BEEN

97
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,268
TURNING A BLIND EYE TO SAUDI

98
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:19,369
ARABIA FOR DECADES.

99
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,374
THEY ARE THE WORST ACTOR

100
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,275
PROMOTING TERRORISM.

101
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:26,576
KNEEL PEEL WE HAVE A VERY

102
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:27,410
BAD CONNECTION WITH YOU ARE

HAVE TO HANG UP ON YOU HERE.

105
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:31,882
THE CROWNED PRINCE ISN'T

106
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:32,215
ALONE.

107
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,316
THE ROYAL FAMILY ITSELF,

108
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,551
IT'S THE PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR

109
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,052
OVER THE YEARS THAT UPSETS

110
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:36,319
YOU.

111
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,454
SO HE COULD GO BUT YOU MIGHT

00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,290
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS

113
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,992
JUST INHOSPITABLE, RIGHT?

114
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,361
>> IN PAKISTAN THEY FUND

115
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,462
OVER 20,000 MADRASAS THAT

116
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:47,764

HATREDS OF WESTERN WAYS AND

118
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,134
HATRED OF CHRISTIANITY.

119
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:53,803
POO LOOTED INDONESIA WHICH

120
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,338

MILD ISLAM.

122
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:59,276
THEY ARE POLLUTING

123
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,678
PHILIPPINES WITH WAHHABIISM.

124
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,280
THEY ARE BAD ACTORS.

125
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,948
WE DON'T NEED TO SANCTION 15

126
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,449
ROGUE ACTORS THAT THEY SEND

127
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,217
OVER HERE.

128
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,852
15 THUGS ARE 15 THUGS.

129
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,220
WE NEED TO NOT SELL ARMS TO

130
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,321
THE REGIME BECAUSE THE

131
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,323
REGIME IS A BAD ACTOR

132
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:16,259
WORLDWIDE.

133
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,827
>> Neil: SENATOR, I WOULD BE

134
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:18,762
REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION

135
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,330
THERE WAS ANOTHER

136
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,165
DEVELOPMENT TODAY WHERE A

137
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,267
FEDERAL JUDGE THREW OUT

138
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:26,770
LAWSUIT FROM STORMY DANIELS.

SHE WILL CONFIRM THE LETTER

146
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:38,648
SHE SIGNED.

SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ME A

148
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:42,285
TOTAL CON.

149
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:43,019
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

150
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,320
THAT.

151
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:46,356

I SPEND ALL MY TIME TRYING

153
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,726
TO GET US OUT OF THE WAR IN

154
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:53,530
AFGHANISTAN AND YEMEN AND

155
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:55,699
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO COMMENT

156
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,434
ON THAT.

157
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:58,501
>> Neil: DO YOU FIND TACKY.

158
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:01,605
>> I HAVE NO OPINION

159
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:02,005
WHATSOEVER.

160
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:02,706
I TOO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS

161
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:03,173
TO TALK ABOUT.

162
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:04,641
WE HAVE BEEN AT WAR FOR 17

163
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,209
YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN.

164
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,577
AND I DO BUG THE PRESIDENT.

165
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:08,345
WHEN I TALK TO THE

166
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:09,379
PRESIDENT, WHEN

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,814
WHAT I TALK TO HIM ABOUT IS

168
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,048
LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF

169
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:12,449
AFGHANISTAN.

170
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,650
WE HAVE NO MILITARY MISSION

171
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:14,050
OVER THERE.

172
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,385
THERE IS NO MILITARY

173
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:15,752
SOLUTION.

174
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:16,886
SO, I GUESS I JUST WANT TO

175
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,121
SPEND ALL MY TIME ON THAT.

176
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,190
I'M JUST NOT INTERESTED IN

177
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,589
THAT.

178
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,691

180
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:23,793
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT.

181
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:24,828
THAT WORRIES SOME IN YOUR

182
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,262
PARTY THAT HE IS WANDERING

183
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:27,797

00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,174
TO SAUDI ARABIA AND I TRY TO

192
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,809
USE ANY POWERS OF PERSUASION

193
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,611
I HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW THEY

194
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,446
ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS AND THAT

195
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:44,981
REALLY THE WAR IN YEMEN, HE

196
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:46,249
TALKS ABOUT HOW THE WAR IN

197
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,751
IRAQ WALLS SUCH A MISTAKE,

198
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:48,985
HE HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT

199
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:49,853
AND STRONG ON THAT.

200
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,287
THE WAR IN YEMEN IS EXACTLY

201
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,255
THE SAME WAY.

202
00:04:52,256 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO CHAOS
