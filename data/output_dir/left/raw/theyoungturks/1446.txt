1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,030
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WANT TO
STEP UP AND DEFEND UNDOCUMENTED

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,029
IMMIGRANTS, AND ALSO PROTECT
THEM FROM SOME OF THE MORE

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,860
DRACONIAN POLICIES THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS ROLLING OUT,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,160
SO SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY WANTED
TO VISIT A DETENTION CENTER IN

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,640
TEXAS, WHICH BY THE WAY USED TO
BE A WALMART APPARENTLY, TO SEE

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,550
HOW CHILDREN ARE BEING TREATED
IN THAT DETENTION CENTER.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,919
REMEMBER, ONE OF THE NEWER
POLICIES OF THE TRUMP

8
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:29,480
ADMINISTRATION IS TO SEPARATE
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AT

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,529
THE BORDER ONCE THEY TRY TO COME
INTO THE COUNTRY, AND IF THEY

10
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:33,529
GET CAUGHT.

11
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:36,239
WELL, HERE IS WHAT
HAPPENED WHEN SENATOR MERKLEY

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,750
SHOWED UP TO THE FACILITY IN
BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS, TAKE A LOOK.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,850
>>IS YOUR SUPERVISOR COMING
OUT?

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,850
>>MR.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,850
SANCHEZ, YOU ARE THE
SUPERVISOR?

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,090
>>LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MY
TEAM.

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,870
WHAT I'LL BE WITH YOU IN

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,720
JUST A MINUTE.

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,100
>>THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO TALK.

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:04,159
>>I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE A
STATEMENT BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,479
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COULD GIVE
YOU A STATEMENT.

22
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,330
>>THAT'S ON YOUR WEBSITE TOO
AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT YOU

23
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,380
ARE THE SUPERVISOR.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,130
>>I'LL BE WITH YOU GUYS IN A
MINUTE.

25
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,130
>>THE SUPERVISOR IS HERE.

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,140
>>DO YOU GUYS MIND?

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,890
>>I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,740
>>AS WE WALK OFF THE PROPERTY,
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE, I WILL

29
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,120
COMPLY WITH THAT.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,549
>>SO HE SAYS THAT HE WAS IN
TOUCH WITH SOMEONE AT THE

31
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,130
FACILITY TO GET PERMISSION TO
SEE IT PRIOR TO SHOWING UP, HE

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,360
DIDN'T JUST SHOW UP AND EXPECT
TO BE LET IN, BUT THEY DENIED

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,659
HIM ACCESS, AND KEEP IN MIND
THAT THIS IS A DETENTION

34
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,650
FACILITY THAT IS BEING RUN BY
THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE

35
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,040
RESETTLEMENT.

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,430
THAT ORGANIZATION
HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS QUITE A BIT

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,020
LATELY BECAUSE OF THE MISSING
MIGRANT CHILDREN WHO HAD COME

38
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,130
INTO THE COUNTRY BACK IN 2014.

39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,289
SO THAT WAS A PROBLEM ON ITS

40
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,290
OWN, BUT THAT PROBLEM WILL NOW
BE EXACERBATED CONSIDERING

41
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,270
THE FACT THAT CHILDREN WILL
BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

42
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,419
PARENTS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO COME
INTO THE COUNTRY.

43
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,500
>>LET IT SINK IN THAT WE HAVE
SECRET DETENTION CENTERS IN

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,580
AMERICA WHERE WE ARE HOUSING
KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,010
FROM THEIR FAMILIES, AND THAT WE
WILL NOT ALLOW UNITED STATES

46
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,220
SENATORS TO GO INSIDE THEM.

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,370
THAT
IS THE COUNTRY WE ARE IN NOW.

48
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,820
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET A
SENATOR GO IN?

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,640
WHO CAN GO IN?

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,250
CAN THE PRESIDENT GO IN?

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,710
PRESUMABLY, RIGHT?

52
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,790
HE IS THE ONE

53
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,970
WHO SET THEM UP IN THE FIRST
PLACE.

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,970
I'M SURE THE VICE

55
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,080
PRESIDENT CAN, I'M SURE THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,750
CAN.

57
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,200
CAN REPUBLICAN SENATORS GO
IN?

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,240
CAN TED CRUZ GO IN?

59
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
IT'S IN

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
TEXAS, HE'S A SENATOR FROM
TEXAS.

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
MY GUESS IS YOU WOULD LET

62
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,380
HIM IN.

63
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,800
ARE ONLY DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS BLOCKED FROM GOING IN,

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,590
OR ARE ALL OF OUR
REPRESENTATIVES NOT ALLOWED TO

65
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,510
SEE WHERE WE KEEP THE KIDS?

66
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,620
LET
THAT SINK IN.

67
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,640
WE LIVE IN A

68
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,250
SO-CALLED DEMOCRACY COME OUR
REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOT ALLOWED

69
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,760
INTO THESE SECRET DETENTION
CENTERS.

70
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
LET'S NOTE THE IRONY

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,270
THAT CONSERVATIVES SAID THAT
OBAMA WAS GOING TO START

72
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,750
FEMA CAMPS WHERE THEY WOULD
SECRETLY DETAIN PEOPLE AND

73
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,000
NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO SEE THEM.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,700
>>THEIR CONCERNS WERE AMERICANS,
BUT IF YOU ARE A MINOR WHO

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,840
HAPPENS TO BE UNDOCUMENTED, THEN
WE WILL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM YOUR

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,060
PARENTS AND JUST DETAIN YOU
INDEFINITELY WHILE YOUR PARENTS

77
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,060
SEEK PROSECUTION.

78
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,470
BY THE WAY,
OFTENTIMES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO

79
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,510
SEEK REFUGE IN THE UNITED
STATES, AND TRUMP'S REACTION OR

80
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,430
RESPONSE TO THEM IS YOU ARE
TRYING TO COME INTO THE U.S., WE

81
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,400
ARE GOING TO PROSECUTE YOU, TAKE
YOUR KIDS AWAY, DETAIN THEM, AND

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,960
BY THE WAY NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO
COME SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE

83
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,670
IN THE DETENTION CENTERS, AND
THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU.

84
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,670
BY

85
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,990
THE WAY, FOR-PROFIT PRISONS ARE
MAKING A KILLING OFF OF U.S. TAX

86
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:05,940
DOLLARS FUNDING THEM SO PEOPLE
CAN BE IN THERE AWAITING

87
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,020
PROSECUTION.

88
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,590
>>OF WALMART TURNED INTO A
SECRET DETENTION CENTER IS MAYBE

89
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,529
THE PERFECT SYMBOL FOR
RIGHT-WING AMERICA.

90
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,529
THE WHOLE

91
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,529
THING IS STOMACH CHURNING.

92
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,130
I
WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO SENATOR

93
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,130
MERKLEY HERE.

94
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,940
SOME PEOPLE ASKED
ME WHO DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST

95
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,840
PROGRESSIVE SENATORS IN THE
COUNTRY?

96
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,101
BERNIE SANDERS AND

97
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,750
ELIZABETH WARREN ARE EASY
ANSWERS, BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW,

98
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,660
JEFF MERKLEY IS CERTAINLY AT THE
TOP OF THAT LIST, HE'S AMONG THE

99
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,150
TOP THREE, MAYBE EVEN MORE
PROGRESSIVE THAN THE OTHER TWO

100
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,760
IN SOME REGARDS.

101
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,090
AND SO I LOVE
WHAT HE DID HERE, BECAUSE THE

102
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,300
DEMOCRATS ARE USUALLY QUITE
HAPLESS IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO

103
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,220
SHINE A LIGHT ON THINGS THAT ARE
GOING WRONG.

104
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,220
THEY WILL DO THESE

105
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,010
PRESS CONFERENCES WHERE THEY
WILL BEG THE REPUBLICANS, STOP

106
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,800
BEING SO MEAN TO US.

107
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,760
MERKLEY
ACTUALLY SHOWED UP AND SAID CAN

108
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,400
I SEE THE PEOPLE YOU ARE
HOLDING?

109
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,410
YOU ARE PART OF THE

110
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,760
U.S. GOVERNMENT, I'M A SENATOR
IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CAN I

111
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,960
SEE THESE PEOPLE?

112
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,900
AND I LOVE
THAT HE BROUGHT A CAMERA.

113
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,900
IS IT

114
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,980
A PHOTO OP?

115
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,590
HE'S GOING TO BE
ATTACKED BY REPUBLICANS

116
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,460
ENDLESSLY FOR IT. IS IT FOR
SELF-AGGRANDIZEMENT?

117
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,710
NO, IT IS

118
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,010
TO LITERALLY PROTECT THE MOST
POWERLESS PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY,

119
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,630
CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR
PARENTS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND

120
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,860
LOCKED INTO A WALMART TURNED
INTO A PRISON.

121
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,860
AND HE GOES TO

122
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
HELP THEM.

123
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,280
BLESS HIS HEART,
THAT'S HOW YOU FIGHT BACK.

124
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,700
>>FOLLOWING HIS LIVE VIDEO ON
FACEBOOK ON THIS VERY INCIDENT

125
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,120
THERE WAS ANOTHER SENATOR WHO
SPOKE OUT, THAT WAS SENATOR BOB

126
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,139
MENENDEZ, AND HE SAID THE
FOLLOWING VIA TWITTER --

127
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:45,139
>>

128
00:05:45,139 --> 00:06:04,970
>>ARE THEY EVER GOING TO
CLARIFY OR EVER ALLOW ANY OF OUR

129
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,430
REPRESENTATIVES TO SEE THESE
KIDS, OR DO WE JUST LIVE IN A

130
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,240
POLICE STATE NOW WHERE PEOPLE
CAN GET LOCKED UP AND YOU NEVER

131
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,550
SEE THEM AGAIN?

132
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,700
WELL, THOSE ARE
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR THE

133
00:06:15,700 --> 00:00:00,000
CRAZY STATE OF AMERICA AS WE
HAVE IT TODAY.
