1
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:13,120
MARK: HELLO, AMERICA.

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,754
I AM MARKET WITHIN.

3
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:14,956
WE HAVE A GREAT GUEST FROM

4
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:15,389
KENTUCKY.

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,390

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,558
YOU ARE.

7
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:18,326
MARK: YOU ARE UNIQUELY QUALIFIED

8
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:24,332

BRIEFLY ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND

12
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:28,603
FIRST OFF, FIRST OFFICE YOU EVER

00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:29,637
HELD WAS GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY.

14
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:30,605
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

15
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:34,175
MARK: THE FIRST --

16
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,944
>> HE ENTIRE AND THAT HE DID.

00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:38,512
I WANT TO GET IN WITH THIS IN A

18
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:42,383
MOMENT.

00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:43,150
MARK: YOU ELECTED THE 62nd

20
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,353
GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY 2013.

21
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:48,756
NOT MANY REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS OF

22
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:49,557
KENTUCKY IN MODERN TIMES?

23
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:51,592
>> NO, I MAY BE LIKE THE FOURTH

24
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:54,695
OR SO IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS.

25
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:57,732
MARK: YOU GREW UP WITH FAMILY,

00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,104
FOR, BASED ON WHAT I READ.

28
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:08,876
>> WE WERE FINANCIALLY HUMBLE.

29
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:09,844
THAT IS CERTAINLY BELOW THE

30
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:10,277
POVERTY LEVEL.

31
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:11,212
MARK: YOU GREW UP ON A FARM,

32
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:16,283
RAISE CROPS AND LIVESTOCK IN YOU

33
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:17,184
HAD PARENTS WHO INSTILLED IN YOU

34
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:21,355
FAMILY AND FAITH.

35
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,256
YOU ATTENDED WASHINGTON AND LEE

36
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,892

00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,494
FROM ACTIVE DUTY IN THE '90s

39
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,796
ARMY AS AN OFFICER.

40
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:29,897
YOU LEFT THE SERVICE HAVING

41
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:34,769
ACHIEVED THE RANK OF CAPTAIN.

42
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:35,536
YOU FOUNDED SEVERAL COMPANIES IN

43
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,404
KENTUCKY AND INVESTED IN A

44
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:37,872
NUMBER OF OTHERS IN THE

45
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:40,908
COMMONWEALTH AS WELL AS OTHER

46
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:43,511
STATES AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

47
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:43,944
THIS ELECTION.

48
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:44,679
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND CIRCLE

49
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:45,880
BACK TO YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND

50
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,448
HOW YOU BECAME GOVERNOR.

51
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:52,753
IT'S NOT A STRAIGHT LINE.

52
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:53,454
IN A TOUGH STATE AND THE KEEP

53
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:55,289
TALKING ABOUT THIS BLUE WAVE.

54
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:55,890
AND SOME OF THE EARLY

55
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,893
INDICATIONS ARE THERE IS GOING

56
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:00,995
TO BE OR MAYBE SOME KIND OF BLUE

57
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,798
WAVE AND YOU ARE A MAN OF

58
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:05,099
GOVERNMENT IN HISTORY AND

59
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:05,866
POLITICS SO WHAT YOU SEE

60
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:16,844
HAPPENING HERE?

61
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:17,845
>> I AM A STUDENT OF HISTORY.

62
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:19,380
I GREW UP IN A HOME WITH NO

63
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,781
TELEVISION SO WE DID READ A LOT

64
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:21,649
AND ALWAYS BEEN INTELLECTUALLY

65
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:22,416
CURIOUS ABOUT A VARIETY OF

66
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:22,817
THINGS.

67
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:23,918
I LOOK AT STATISTICS AND THEY

68
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:25,186
SEEM TO STICK IN MY HEAD AND I

69
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:25,820
DO KNOW THIS.

70
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,687
IN MODERN TIMES THEY'RE ONLY

71
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,089
BEEN TWICE WHEN THERE WAS NOT A

72
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:28,723
MIDTERM SHIFT IN POWER.

73
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:29,957
IT IS THE NORM AND WOULD BE

74
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,727
UNUSUAL IF THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT

75
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:33,594
TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.

76
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:37,064
IN FACT, THE AVERAGE HAS BEEN 31

77
00:02:37,064 --> 00:02:38,199
SEATS IN EACH OF THE MIDTERM

78
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,900
ELECTIONS THAT HAVE CHANGED

79
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,635
PARTIES.

80
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,802
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A 24C LEAD,

81
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:48,543
I BELIEVE, WHICH WOULD IMPLY

82
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,143
THEIR SEVEN SEATS DOWN.

83
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:49,911
STATISTICALLY, HISTORICALLY IT'S

84
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:51,045
A GIVEN THAT THEY WILL LOSE THE

85
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,715
HOUSE.

86
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:55,816
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TWO TIMES

87
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:56,817
WHEN THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

88
00:02:56,817 --> 00:03:02,657
I TRULY DO BELIEVE THIS WILL BE

89
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:03,124
THE THIRD TIME.

90
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,092
WE ARE IN -- THE PARADIGM HAS

91
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:04,525
SHIFTED.

92
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,860
WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT TIME AND

93
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,794
FOR PEOPLE WITH ALL THE

94
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:07,729
NARRATIVE WE GET IN WHAT PASSES

95
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,130
FOR MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND I SAY

96
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,599
THAT NOT PEJORATIVELY BUT THEY

97
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,233
WOULD CALL THEMSELVES,

98
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,000
TRADITIONAL MEDIA, WOULD HAVE US

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,776
BELIEVE THAT THIS PERSON WHO IS

100
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:22,777
NOW THE PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP,

101
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,045
IS NOT EVEN REALLY THE PRESENT

102
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,380
AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN HAD

103
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,581
NO CHANCE AND DOES NOT DESERVE

104
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,782
TO BE THERE AND ONE STEP AWAY

105
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:28,349
FROM BEING IMPEACHED.

106
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,417
THIS NARRATIVE THEY WOULD HAVE

107
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,853
US BELIEVE IS NOT REALLY

108
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:32,787
CONNECTED TO WHAT THE AMERICAN

109
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:33,988
PEOPLE BELIEVE OR HE WOULD NOT

110
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:44,599
HAVE GOTTEN 307 ELECTORAL VOTES.

111
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,833
THE HOPING THAT THERE IS AN

112
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,801
APPETITE FOR WHAT HE'S BEEN

113
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,002
DOING THAT IS NOT EVIDENT BASED

114
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:49,337
ON POLLING OR WHAT PEOPLE ARE

115
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:50,138
SAYING OR WHAT YARD SIGNS OR

116
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:52,907
BUMPER STICKERS ARE OUT THERE

117
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:58,013
JUST AS IT IS NOT EVIDENT IN

118
00:03:58,013 --> 00:03:58,980
2060 THIS WILL BE THE THIRD

119
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,281
TIME.

120
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,081
WILL THE REPUBLICANS LOSE SEATS?

121
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:00,548
YES THEY WILL.

122
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:02,017
IT WILL BE SHOCKING IF THEY DO

123
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:06,655
NOT BUT THEY WILL LOSE SEATS.

124
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:07,422
WILL THEY LOSE 31?

125
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:08,189
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

126
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,124
WILL THEY LOSE EVEN 25?

127
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:09,858
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

128
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:10,558
THE VOTERS WILL DECIDE.

129
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:11,293
EVERY DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT.

130
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,560
THE LEVEL OF RESENTMENT THAT HAS

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,196
HELD BY A HANDFUL IS NOT

132
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:16,197
WIDESPREAD AMONG THE PEOPLE AND

133
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:20,601
I TRULY BELIEVE THE PEOPLE ARE

134
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,636
GRATEFUL FOR THE PRESIDENT AND

135
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,906
HIS WILLINGNESS TO SHAKE THINGS

136
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,409
UP AND WILLINGNESS TO DELIVER ON

137
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:27,909
PROMISES HE MADE.

138
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,544
HE IS DOING -- PEOPLE MAY OR MAY

139
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:30,278
NOT LIKE THE METHODOLOGY BUT YOU

140
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:31,680
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THE RESULTS.

141
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,488
HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS EXITING

142
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,422
LIKE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE

143
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:41,723
PRECEDED HIM IN WHAT HE RAN ON.

144
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:42,524
THAT'S A REFRESHING CHANGE OF

145
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:43,025
PACE FOR AMERICA.

146
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:43,925
MARK: THESE NEWS REPORTS TALK

147
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:48,330
ABOUT HOW THE DEMOCRAT BASE IS

148
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,864
ALL FIRED UP.

149
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:50,198
AND HOW THE REPUBLICAN BASE IS

150
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:50,732
RELATIVELY PASSIVE.

151
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,901
I'M STARTING TO SEE A CHANGE IN

152
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:59,241
THIS.

153
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:00,208
THERE IS POTENTIAL BACKLASH THAT

154
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,476
THE MEDIA ARE SO ONE-SIDED AND

155
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:02,744
SO OVER-THE-TOP THAT THE

156
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,913
DEMOCRATS WHETHER HEARINGS FOR

157
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:06,748
WHAT EVER IS TAKING PLACE THE

158
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:09,918
ATTACKS ON TED CRUZ AND OTHER

159
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:10,619
CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS

160
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:11,753
WHO SERVE IN THE ADMINISTRATION

161
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:15,858
AT RESTAURANTS AND SO FORTH, YOU

162
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:16,892
REALLY THINK THERE'S A

163
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:17,593
RELATIVELY SILENT MAJORITY SO

164
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:25,400
CALL THAT OUT THERE THAT WILL

165
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,502
SHOW UP IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION?

166
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:27,669
>> NO WAY I WOULD BE THE

167
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:28,036
GOVERNOR.

168
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,837
NO WAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

169
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:29,805
WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT IF THAT

170
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:30,973
MAJORITY DID NOT EXIST AND WOULD

171
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,474
NOT BE POSSIBLE.

172
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:33,909
I DO NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE

173
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,743
PARTY OR POWERS THAT BE OR ANY

174
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:37,446
PARTICULAR POLITICAL ASSESSMENT

175
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:37,847
NOR DID HE.

176
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:45,788
IN FACT I WAS IN A MORE

177
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:46,522
MICROCOSMIC LEVEL IN KENTUCKY

178
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:47,256
AND A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM IN

179
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:48,023
WAYS THAT UNNERVE PEOPLE BECAUSE

180
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:48,424
WHO WAS I?

181
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:50,659
I WAS SOMEONE WHO DID NOT HAVE

182
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,360
NOT KISSED THE RIGHT WINGS FOR

183
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,161
BACKSIDES OR WAITED IN LINE OR

184
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:52,862
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AND

185
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:56,465
HE'S DONE THE SAME THING.

186
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:57,132
AMERICA IS HUNGRY FOR THIS.

187
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,168
AMERICA IS NOT A FOOL THAT SO

188
00:05:59,168 --> 00:05:59,835
MANY IN THE POLITICAL RANKS

189
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:01,003
WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE

190
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:09,578
ARE.

191
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,212
THAT IS THE GREATNESS OF

192
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:10,546
AMERICA.

193
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:11,247
PEOPLE ARE, AT THE END OF THE

194
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:11,847
DAY, NOT EASILY FOOLED.

195
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,783
I TRULY BELIEVE THERE IS A

196
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:14,517
HUNGER FOR CONTINUATION OF THE

197
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:24,193
PATH WE ARE ON WHICH AMERICA

198
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:24,827
STANDING FIRMLY FOR LIFE,

199
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:25,594
LIBERTY AND THE THINGS THAT THE

200
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,262
SHOW IS HERE TO DISCUSS.

201
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:26,929
THESE ARE THE FOUNDATIONAL

202
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,663
TENETS UPON WHICH THIS NATION

203
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:28,030
WAS BUILT.

204
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,798
IT'S REFRESHING WHEN WE HAVE A

205
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:29,932
LEADER IN WASHINGTON WHO

206
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:35,304
BELIEVES THIS TO HIS CORE.

207
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:36,072
MARK: YOU MENTIONED THE HOUSE OF

208
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:36,539
REPRESENTATIVES.

209
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,675
WHAT ABOUT THE STATE SENATE?

210
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:40,376
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP THE

211
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,143
REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE WINNING A

212
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,645
WHOLE BUNCH OF SEATS.

213
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,981
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE AND

214
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,250
HOUSE ARE NOT DELIVERED ON A LOT

215
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:47,750
OF THEIR PROMISES.

216
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,918
THE PRESIDENT HAS.

217
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,923
BUT SPENDING IS UP, THAT IS WAY

218
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:54,590
OUT BUT THEY'VE DONE GOOD

219
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,293
THINGS.

220
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,061
NOT AN ADDITIONAL PENNY FOR THE

221
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:00,129
LOSS OF THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING

222
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:00,897
VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO GET TAKING

223
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:04,901
CARE OF.

224
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:08,938
HOW DO YOU SEE THE SENATE IN THE

225
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:11,607
SELECTION?

226
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:12,275
GOVERNOR BEVIN: I WOULD BE

227
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:13,042
SHOCKED IF THEY DID NOT PICK UP

228
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:13,543
ONE OR TWO SEATS.

229
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:14,277
YOU ARE CORRECT IN A DIFFERENT

230
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:16,512
ENVIRONMENT, WITH A DIFFERENT

231
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:17,146
SENSE OF MOTIVATION IN A

232
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:20,750
DIFFERENT SENSE OF URGENCY

233
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,484
PERHAPS BUT THE REASONS FOR WHY

234
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,251
WE'RE NOT GETTING THE THINGS WE

235
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:23,953
COULD LAY DIRECTIONAL BLAME IN

236
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:26,689
ANY DIRECTION.

237
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,925
WE MIGHT PICK UP FIVE, SIX OR

238
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:34,531
SEVEN.

239
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:35,164
TRUTHFULLY, WITH FAR MORE

240
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:35,899
POTENTIAL PICKUPS AND WE HAVE

241
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:36,666
SEATS TO DEFEND AS A PUBLICANS.

242
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:44,340
I SAY THIS AS A REPUBLICAN.

243
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,141
I THINK WE COULD PICK UP ONE OR

244
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:45,642
TWO PRETTY EASILY.

245
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:46,476
I'D BE SHOCKED IF WE DIDN'T COME

246
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:47,243
OUT WITH 53, 54 SEATS IN THE

247
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:47,577
SENATE.

248
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:48,378
MARK: SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

249
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:51,381
ON ELECTION NIGHT THE FIRST

250
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,115
TUESDAY NIGHT IN NOVEMBER, WE

251
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:52,882
ALL WATCH TELEVISION OR LISTEN

252
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:53,616
TO THE RADIO AND THE SAME PEOPLE

253
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:54,350
WERE SHOCKED AT DONALD TRUMP'S

254
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,151
VICTORY WILL BE SHOCKED AT WHAT

255
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:56,719
HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERM

256
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:57,086
ELECTION.

257
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:59,122
GOVERNOR BEVIN: I BELIEVE SO.

258
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,826
IT BECOMES THIS FALSE NARRATIVE

259
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,894
THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON HAS

260
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:06,329
BEEN PREDETERMINED IN THE MINDS

261
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:11,134
OF SOME AND TRY TO WILL IT INTO

262
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:12,969
PERDITION BY TALKING ABOUT IT

263
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,871
NONSTOP AS IF IT'S A FOREGONE

264
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,272
CONCLUSION.

265
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:20,777
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WITH IN

266
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:21,511
THE INSULATED WORLD THAT THEY

267
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:22,279
HAVE THE CONVERSATION IT SOUNDS

268
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,715
GOOD AND NO ONE DISAGREES

269
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,616
BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT THE FALSE

270
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:27,350
NARRATIVE TO COME TRUE BUT THE

271
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,119
HEARTLAND IN PLACES LIKE

272
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:32,188
KENTUCKY PEOPLE AREN'T READING

273
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:32,889
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND NOT

274
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:33,657
READING "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND

275
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,458
THEY DON'T GIVE A RIP ABOUT WHAT

276
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,260
SOME PERSON IN DC THANKS ABOUT

277
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,894
THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.

278
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,029
THEY DON'T.

279
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,763
WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT ARE THE

280
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,364
SAME THINGS THEY HAVE ALWAYS

281
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:43,433
CARED ABOUT.

282
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,201
THEY CARE ABOUT THE SECURITY OF

283
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:47,070
THEIR FAMILIES, THE PHYSICAL

284
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,004
SECURITY AND THE FINANCIAL

285
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:48,371
SECURITY.

286
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:51,641
THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR WALLETS

287
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,243
AND WHETHER THE MONEY THEY EARN

288
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:55,812
IS ABLE TO BE KEPT AS MUCH AS

289
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,546
POSSIBLE BY THEMSELVES AND TO

290
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:58,715
THE EXTENT IT'S NOT WHAT THE

291
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:01,284
GOVERNMENT DOES IT IS USEFUL AND

292
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:08,058
PRODUCTIVE.

293
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:08,692
THESE ARE SIMPLE THINGS.

294
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:09,259
WE ARE SIMPLE PEOPLE.

295
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,027
WE'RE NOT EASILY FOOLED AND NOT

296
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:14,631
IDIOTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE

297
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:15,432
WANT SIMPLE THINGS IN OUR LIVES.

298
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:16,166
WE WANT FAMILIES TO LIVE IN

299
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:16,934
FREEDOM AND WE WANT AS LITTLE

300
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:17,601
GOVERNMENT IN OUR LIVES AS

301
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:20,204
POSSIBLE.

302
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:21,038
I WEAR THIS BUTTON, IT'S A PAIR

303
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:23,407
OF SCISSORS CUTTING THROUGH RED

304
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:24,174
TAPE, IT'S AN INDICATION PEOPLE

305
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:25,642
ON MY TEAM WEAR THIS.

306
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:26,376
I PLEDGED WHEN I WAS ELECTED I

307
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,645
WOULD CUT 30% OF ALL REGULATION

308
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:31,048
IN OUR STATE IN OVER THREE YEARS

309
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:31,848
BUT WE ARE WELL UNDERWAY TO

310
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:36,720
DOING THAT.

311
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,488
PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS IS GOING TO

312
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:38,122
COMPROMISE OUR SAFETY AND

313
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:38,956
SECURITY IN ENVIRONMENT BUT

314
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:39,323
NONSENSE.

315
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:42,826
STILL 100,000 RULES TELLING US

316
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:47,331
WHAT WE CAN OR CANNOT DO.

317
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:48,098
AMERICANS ARE FED UP WITH THIS.

318
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:48,832
NO ONE WANTS A DIRTY ENVIRONMENT

319
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:56,140
OR DIRTY AIR OR UNSAFE BEACH OR

320
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,840
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT

321
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,474
THEY'RE INCREASINGLY LESS

322
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:58,242
CONVINCED THAT MORE GOVERNMENT

323
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:58,976
RULES ARE THE ANSWER TO GIVE

324
00:09:58,976 --> 00:09:59,676
THEM LIBERTY THAT THEY WERE

325
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:04,715
INNATELY CREATED TO CRAVE AND

326
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:08,986
THAT WE BEEN BLESSED IN THIS

327
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:11,622
NATION TO HAVE SUCH AN ABUNDANCE

328
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:12,389
THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO TAKE IT

329
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,458
FOR GRANTED.

330
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:19,330
I'VE ASKED MY BIGGEST THREAT TO

331
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,097
AMERICA WAS AND I THINK IT'S OUR

332
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:21,232
APATHY.

333
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:25,402
THE FACT YOU'RE SO BLESSED THAT

334
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:32,009
WE CAN AFFORD TO NOT CARE.

335
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:32,910
WE HAVE IT SO GOOD THAT WE CAN

336
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,677
AFFORD TO NOT CARE AND CONVINCED

337
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:34,345
OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IS NOT

338
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:38,315
LIKELY TO CHANGE.

339
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:39,049
EVERY CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION

340
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:45,623
SINCE THE DAWN OF MAN SCRIBBLED

341
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:46,323
FROM WITHIN EXTERIOR WARS, WAS

342
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:49,493
MUNITIONS IN CAPITALS AND

343
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:49,827
BORDERS.

344
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:56,033
BUT WORST NOT DESTROY CULTURES.

345
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:56,567
WORDS DO NOT DESTROY

346
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,001
CIVILIZATIONS.

347
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:57,768
THOSE ARE DESTROYED FROM WITHIN

348
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,904
DUE TO COMPLACENCY AND APATHY.

349
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:00,972
MARK: BEYOND THE PRESIDENCY AND

350
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:05,710
ELECTION, DO YOU THINK WERE

351
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,377
BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE FROM

352
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:06,711
WITHIN?

353
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:07,378
GOVERNOR BEVIN: NO DOUBT.

354
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:14,986
I WROTE A LETTER BACK FROM YEARS

355
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:15,620
AGO TO SOMEONE IN THE

356
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,354
FAITH-BASED IMMUNITY ENTITLED

357
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:16,954
WHERE ARE THE DANIELS?

358
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:17,688
THIS IS BEFORE I THREW MY HAT

359
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:20,124
INTO THE POLITICAL ARENA THIS

360
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:20,825
WAS THE ONE AS A FATHER,

361
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:23,060
VETERAN, HUSBAND, TAXPAYING

362
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:31,135
EMPLOYER OF OTHER PEOPLE,

363
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:31,936
SOMEONE WHO IS LIKE SO MANY OF

364
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:32,603
YOUR VIEWERS THOSE OUT THERE

365
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:33,304
LIVING MY LIFE AND I LOOKED

366
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:34,005
AROUND THE LANDSCAPE AND SAID

367
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:34,539
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

368
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,207
WE BECOME NUMB AND AGAIN, IT'S

369
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:40,044
NOT TO PICK ON I'M A BIG

370
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:40,678
BELIEVER IN TERM LIMITS.

371
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,914
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

372
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:49,354
THE GOOD COMES FROM COMPLACENCY

373
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:50,021
WHETHER IT'S A BUSINESS OR

374
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:50,755
GOVERNMENT OR CHURCH, PICK THE

375
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:52,990
CATEGORY, IF PEOPLE COME TO A

376
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,926
CUSTOM TO ANY ONE THING FOR TOO

377
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:55,693
LONG IT USUALLY DOES NOT RESULT

378
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:56,327
IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT.

379
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,796
TO THAT END I LOOKED AROUND AND

380
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:05,269
SAID AMERICA IS GETTING SOFT IN

381
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:06,003
THE UNDERBELLY IS GETTING SOFT.

382
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:06,638
I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.

383
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:07,372
I WROTE THIS LETTER AND SAID

384
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:08,006
WHERE ARE THE DANIELS?

385
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:08,773
WHERE THE PEOPLE FROM AMONG US,

386
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:09,540
NORMAL PEOPLE, BUT ARE WILLING

387
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,413
TO RISE UP AND GIVE MODERN

388
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:16,147
EQUIVALENT OF DEFIANCE TO THE

389
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:16,915
KING AND SAY THIS IS NOT

390
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:19,918
ACCEPTABLE AND THIS IS NOT WHO

391
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:20,852
WE ARE IN THESE ARE NOT THE

392
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,820
VALUES THAT WE HOLD.

393
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,488
THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF

394
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:28,727
CONCERN FOR SOME TIME.

395
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:29,394
YOU OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE IN

396
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:34,132
POLITICS TALK ABOUT HOW HER AT A

397
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:34,532
CROSSROADS.

398
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:35,300
I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER ONLY IN

399
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,734
THIS RESPECT.

400
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:39,971
IN RECENT YEARS WE SAW IN 2016

401
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:40,772
AND WE ARE STILL THERE IT'S MORE

402
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:41,473
OF A FORK IN THE ROAD.

403
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:42,273
LET'S TAKE CROSSROADS -- THAT

404
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:46,344
IMPLIES OPTIONS THAT FORK IN THE

405
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:47,145
ROAD YOU GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

406
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:50,081
IN AMERICA IS STILL BUT HAD VERY

407
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:50,849
MUCH IN RECENT YEARS BEEN AT

408
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:51,416
THIS FORK IN THE ROAD.

409
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,387
WE WILL DOG LIKE HARD TO THE

410
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,187
LEFT IN A WAY THAT MAY HAVE NOT

411
00:12:56,187 --> 00:13:00,392
BEEN POSSIBLE TO RETURN FROM

412
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:00,992
WORK GO TO THE RIGHT.

413
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:01,826
MARK: WHEN WE COME BACK HOME AND

414
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:02,927
ASK YOU WHAT SHOULD THESE WILL

415
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:07,232
BEGIN BE RUNNING ON?

416
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:07,966

417
00:13:07,966 --> 00:00:00,000
AS A CONSERVATIVE AND HE FOUGHT
