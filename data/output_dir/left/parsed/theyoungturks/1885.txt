NIKKI HALEY AND LARRY KUDLOW
ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CATFIGHT.
THERE'S A LOT OF DRAMA, IT'S
LIKE A SOAP OPERA BUT IN
GOVERNMENT, AND IT HAS
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SANCTIONS
AGAINST RUSSIA.
NOW EARLIER THIS
WEEK THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
FINALLY IMPOSING AND ENFORCING
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA BECAUSE
OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS
WHOLE MESS IN SYRIA, AND SO
PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT ALL OF
THESE RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONS ARE
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING WERE
LIKE, SEE, HE'S GOING TO DO
THESE SANCTIONS, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT NOW?
TURNS OUT HE IS NOT PLANNING ON
ENFORCING THE SANCTIONS AND HE
DIDN'T EVEN COMMUNICATE THAT
WITH NIKKI HALEY WHO IS THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS.
NOW, IT ALL STARTED WHEN NIKKI
HALEY WENT ON TELEVISION
AND SAID THIS.
>>ARE THERE ANY CONSEQUENCES
FOR ASSAD'S PATRONS, RUSSIA AND
IRAN, WHO CONTINUE TO PROTECT
HIM?
>>ABSOLUTELY.
SO YOU WILL SEE
THAT RUSSIAN SANCTIONS WILL BE
COMING DOWN, SECRETARY MNUCHIN
WILL BE ANNOUNCING THOSE ON
MONDAY IF HE HASN'T ALREADY, AND
THEY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO ANY
SORT OF COMPANIES THAT ARE
DEALING WITH EQUIPMENT RELATED
TO ASSAD AN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
USE, AND I THINK EVERYONE IS
WHEN TO FEEL IT AT THIS POINT, I
THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WE
SENT A STRONG MESSAGE, AND OUR
HOPE IS THAT THEY LISTEN TO IT.
>>WRONG.
THAT IS NOT WHAT IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.
NO ONE
COMMUNICATED WITH HER THAT
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN, BUT LARRY KUDLOW, WHO IS
TRUMP'S ECONOMIC ADVISOR,
RESPONDED TO WHAT NIKKI HALEY
HAD TO SAY ON TELEVISION
AND HERE IS WHAT HIS RESPONSE
WAS.
>>SHE'S DONE A GREAT JOB, SHE'S
A VERY EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR,
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME
MOMENTARY CONFUSION ABOUT THAT
BUT IF YOU TALK TO STEVE MNUCHIN
AT TREASURY HE WILL TALK TO THE
SAME THING, AND THEY ARE IN
CHARGE OF THIS.
WE'VE HAD
SANCTIONS, ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS
ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION.
>>SO HALEY GETS SALTY ABOUT
THESE COMMENTS AND RESPONDS WITH,
QUOTE --
>>GOOD FOR HER.
NEVER GETS
CONFUSED.
>>CONFUSION IS A NORMAL PART
OF LIFE BUT I LIKE THAT
RESPONSE, IT WAS STRONG.
>>THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING I
LIKE ABOUT NIKKI HALEY.
>>AGREED.
>>I'M GOING TO BREAK THAT DOWN
IN THREE PARTS, ONE IS THE
DRAMA, OR DRAHMS, AS WE LIKE TO
CALL IT, THERE IS THE SHORT-TERM
DRAMA OF THIS CATFIGHT, THE
LONG-TERM DRAMA OF NIKKI HALEY
MAY BE COMING FROM BEHIND WITH A
2 X 4 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP?
HOLD, WE'LL GET TO THAT.
BUT THE
SECOND PART IS THE INSTABILITY
OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND
THE MESSAGE WE ARE SENDING TO
THE WORLD.
AND THE THIRD PART IS
POLICY WHERE I'M MORE ON DONALD
TRUMP'S SIDE THEN NIKKI HALEY'S
SIDE.
WHAT IS THIS?
FIRST OF ALL
I HAVE TO NOTE MY AMUSEMENT AT
HER GOING ON TV AND SAYING WE
ARE SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE TO
RUSSIA.
TURNS OUT, NO, WE'RE
SENDING A REALLY, REALLY WEAK
MESSAGE TO RUSSIA, WHICH IS OKAY
BECAUSE AGAIN I DON'T NEED TO
ANTAGONIZE RUSSIA MORE.
BUT I
WOULD HAVE SKIPPED THE
FLIP-FLOPPING PART BECAUSE THAT
REALLY SEEMS FAIRLY PATHETIC.
AND THEN SHE SAID THIS WILL SHOW
THAT WE MEANT BUSINESS.
NO,
SINCE YOU SAID IT AND HAD TO
TAKE IT BACK IT ACTUALLY SHOWS
THE EXACT OPPOSITE, WE DO NOT
MEAN BUSINESS.
AND FINALLY SHE
SAID THAT RUSSIA WILL BE FEELING
THE PAIN.
NO, IT TURNS OUT
YOU'RE FEELING THE PAIN, NOT
RUSSIA.
SO THAT GETS THE POINT
NUMBER ONE, WHICH IS DONALD
TRUMP APPARENTLY WATCHING THIS
ON TV GREW VERY ANGRY AND
STARTED YELLING AT THE TV, AND
THEN ANYONE ELSE WHO WAS NEARBY,
THAT'S ACCORDING TO NEW YORK
TIMES REPORTING, AND THEY HAVE
SOURCES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.
SO, CLOWN OF ALL CLOWNS, DO YOU
WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR
POLICY IS AND EFFECTIVELY
COMMUNICATE THAT TO ALL THE
PEOPLE IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION,
ESPECIALLY BEFORE THEY GO ON TV?
SO ON THE ISSUE OF WHOSE FAULT
IS THE MISCOMMUNICATION, THAT'S
EXTREMELY CLEAR, OF COURSE
DONALD TRUMP'S FAULT.
NIKKI
HALEY IS A PROFESSIONAL, AND ON
THIS ISSUE I AGREE WITH YOU,
ANA, THAT SHE WAS NOT CONFUSED,
IT WAS TRUMP WHO WAS CONFUSED AS
USUAL.
BUT IT'S A LARGER ISSUE
THAN THAT, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WHO WANT TO PUSH
A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE
TOWARDS RUSSIA, AND THEY KEEP
PUSHING AND PUSHING IN THAT
DIRECTION SO EVERY ONCE IN A
WHILE NIKKI HALEY OR SOMEONE
ELSE WILL COME OUT AND GO WE ARE
GOING TO SHOW RUSSIA, AND THEN
TRUMP IS LIKE, YOU IDIOTS, DID
YOU NOT GET THE MEMO THAT I'M
COMPROMISED?
I DON'T WANT TO DO
SOMETHING STRONG AGAINST RUSSIA,
I OWE THEM, OR WHATEVER IT IS,
TAPES, MONEY LAUNDERING,
WHATEVER, BUT NO, WE AREN'T
DOING ANYTHING STRONG ON RUSSIA,
WHEN IS IT GOING TO GET THROUGH
YOUR THICK HEAD THAT I'M
CORRUPT?
>>I HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO
CHIME IN ON.
FIRST OF ALL I WANT
TO MENTION THIS CAVEAT FOR I GET
INTO MY COMMENTARY BECAUSE NIKKI
HALEY'S FOREIGN POLICY IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE
OF, SHE'S INCREDIBLY HAWKISH,
SHE IS IN FAVOR OF, YOU KNOW,
DOING THESE SANCTIONS, BECAUSE,
LOOK, SHE BELIEVES IN THE
SANCTIONS, BUT SHE ALWAYS WANTS
TO TAKE A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE
APPROACH THAN WE NEED TO WHEN IT
COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY, SO
OVERALL I DON'T NECESSARILY
AGREE WITH HER.
HOWEVER, WHEN IT
COMES TO HOW ALL THIS ALL
UNFOLDED PUBLICLY, SHE IS NOT IN
THE WRONG.
SHE WAS NOT ADVISED
THAT THEY HAD DECIDED TO SWITCH
GEARS, AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME
STATEMENTS FROM ACTUAL WHITE
HOUSE OFFICIALS THAT SPOKE TO
THE NEW YORK TIMES --
>>
>>SO THIS KEEPS HAPPENING OVER
AND OVER AGAIN IN THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION, AND STANDARD
PROTOCOL IS, WELL, THE PERSON
WHO WASN'T INFORMED AND
UNFORTUNATELY MADE THESE
STATEMENTS PUBLICLY SHOULD NOW
BE SMEARED, OR SHOULD BE
CRITICIZED, OR SHOULD BE PUT
DOWN IN SOME WAY. AND SO THAT'S
WHEN KUDLOW GETS INVOLVED AND
SAID SHE MUST HAVE GOTTEN
CONFUSED, I'M PARAPHRASING, AND
I LOVE THAT SHE WASN'T HAVING
IT.
SHE'S LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO
FOLLOW PROTOCOL, I DON'T GET
CONFUSED, HERE IS WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED.
SO I APPRECIATE HOW
SHE HANDLED THAT EVEN IF OVERALL
WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY
I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH
HER.
WITH THAT SAID, CENK
ALLUDED TO TRUMP'S REACTION
AFTER WATCHING HALEY ON
TELEVISION AND WHAT SHE HAD TO
SAY ABOUT THE SANCTIONS, AND THE
TIMES IS REPORTING THAT THIS
HAPPENED, LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC
EIGHT --
>>
>>AND APPARENTLY HE REPEATED
AGAIN, WHO WROTE THAT FOR HER?
>>LET ME BE CLEAR, THESE ARE
TWO DIFFERENT INSTANCES, SAME
REACTION IN BOTH.
WHEN SHE'S ON
FACE THE NATION TALKING ABOUT
RUSSIA OVER THE WEEKEND HE GETS
ANGRY AND YELLS AT THE TV.
EARLIER IN THE ADMINISTRATION
WHEN SHE HAD GONE AND CRITICIZED
RUSSIA ABOUT THEIR INTERVENTION
IN UKRAINE, SAME EXACT REACTION.
SUPER ANGRY, YELLING AT THE
SCREEN, ETC., THAT GOES TO THE
POINT I WAS MAKING EARLIER.
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR TRUMP, WHEN
ARE YOU GOING TO REALIZE HE
DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
ABOUT RUSSIA?
AND YOU KNOW FOR
SOME ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT TO
THINK NO, NO, TRUMP HAS DEEPLY
HELD PRINCIPLES AND THE
GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY --
.
ANYWAY, YOU THINK
THAT, GOD BLESS YOUR HEART.
OKAY, THEN HE HAS A GOVERNING
PHILOSOPHY THAT WE SHOULD BE AT
PEACE WITH RUSSIA AND SANCTIONS
AND BOMBING AND ALL THESE
DIFFERENT THINGS ARE GOING TO
UPSET THAT GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY,
OR HE'S COMPROMISED, BUT EITHER
WAY IT'S CLEAR THAT HE FEELS
VERY, VERY STRONGLY THAT WE
SHOULD BE SOFT ON RUSSIA.
AND BY
THE WAY, AGAIN ON POLICY I'M
ABOUT TO AGREE WITH HIM ON SOME
PARTS.
BUT NO, THE
MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, THE
NEOCONSERVATIVES -- HERE, I'LL
GET TO MY AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW,
NIKKI HALEY IS A NEOCON, AND AS
RO KHANNA POINTED OUT SHE'S A
PARENT OF LINDSAY GRAHAM AND
JOHN MCCAIN, AND THAT'S HER JOB,
IS TO DRIVE US INTO WAR.
SO NO,
I VOTE NO, I'M TOTALLY AGAINST
THAT.
NO MATTER WHY TRUMP WANTS
TO BE VERY, VERY FRIENDLY TO
RUSSIA, I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE
VERY FRIENDLY TO RUSSIA, I
BELIEVE SOME OF THE SANCTIONS
MIGHT MAKE SENSE, BUT IN TERMS
OF THE BOMBING OR DRIVING US OR
INTO MILITARY CONFLICT IN SYRIA,
NO WAY.
I'M WITH TRUMP ON THAT,
THAT NO, WE SHOULD TAP THE
BRAKES AND WE SHOULD NOT JUST
BULLDOZE INTO WARS THAT THE
NEOCONS LIKE NIKKI HALEY WANT.
SO ON THE MISCUE IN OCCASION,
THE CLOWNISH IN US, ALL OF THAT,
TRUMP IS WRONG.
ON THE POLICY
NIKKI HALEY IS WAY MORE WRONG
>>OVERALL I AGREE WITH THAT
ASSESSMENT, HOWEVER I DO LOVE
JUST THE WAY SHE'S HANDLING
HERSELF IN THE POSITION THAT
SHE'S IN, BECAUSE REMEMBER,
TRUMP IS SURROUNDED BY YES-MEN,
RIGHT?
I THINK OF JEFF SESSIONS,
AND HOW INCREDIBLY HUMILIATED HE
BECAME AFTER TRUMP HAS
CRITICIZED HIM TIME AND TIME
AGAIN ON SOCIAL MEDIA, HE'S LIKE
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, TRUMP,
PLEASE LIKE ME.
BUT NIKKI HALEY
IS LIKE, I'LL PUSH BACK.
I'LL
YOU AN EXAMPLE, THE NEW YORK
TIMES REPORTED THAT TRUMP HAS
GROWN EXASPERATED BY HER
OUTSPOKENNESS.
HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT.
>>SHOCKING.
>>IS THAT BOTHERING YOU?
AND
THEN ANOTHER THING, THERE ARE
WHISPERS, RUMORS WITHIN THE
WHITE HOUSE INVOLVING MIKE PENCE
AND NIKKI HALEY AND HOW THEY
MIGHT JOIN FORCES TO CHALLENGE
TRUMP IN 2020.
LOOK, I HATE BOTH
OF THEM, I HIT BOTH OF THEM, BUT
I LOVE THAT DRAMA, IT'S SO GOOD.
>>ET TU, HALEY?
SO EARLIER ON
THERE WERE REPORTS THAT NIKKI
HALEY AND DONALD TRUMP WERE
GETTING ALONG FAMOUSLY.
I NEVER
BELIEVED THOSE REPORTS, BECAUSE
NIKKI HALEY WAS NOT IN THE TRUMP
CAMP TO BEGIN WITH DURING THE
PRIMARIES, SHE IS WAY MORE
ESTABLISHMENT THAN DONALD TRUMP,
AND SHE HAS HIGH AMBITIONS.
NONE
OF THESE ARE GOING TO BE A GOOD
MATCH FOR DONALD, SO I WAS JUST
WAITING FOR THIS TO BLOW UP, AND
NOW IT HAS.
SO WHEN TRUMP HEARS
HER BEING TOUGH AGAINST VLADIMIR
PUTIN HE'S LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I KNOW, SHUT UP!
THEN HE
HEARS, WAIT, WAIT, LET ME GET
THIS RIGHT, RUMORS OF PENCE AN
HALEY, NOT IN 2024, IN 2020 WHEN
I WOULD BE RUNNING FOR
REELECTION?
OH NO SHE DIDN'T. SO
HERE COMES ORANGE-FACED, FUMING,
VOLCANO TRUMP.
SO NOW THE CLOCK
HAS BEGUN A NIKKI HALEY'S TENURE
AT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,
TICK TICK TICK.
SHE COULD BE
GONE IN THE NIKKI OF TIME.
>>YOU'RE THE WORST.
>>AGREED.
>>LET'S PRETEND LIKE THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN.
>>I SHOULD HAVE INTERRUPTED YOU
SOONER.
MAYBE I'M MISSING, WE
ARE TALKING SANCTIONS, I DON'T
THINK SHE'S TALKING ABOUT, OKAY,
SO THE POLICY NOW BEING BECAUSE
WHATEVER CHEMICAL ATTACK
HAPPENED IN SYRIA WE WILL LAUNCH
MORE BOMBS AND TRUMP IS AGAINST
THAT?
BECAUSE BEASLEY HIS FOR
THAT, HE DID IT, OF COURSE IT'S
A CURSORY THING TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE HE'S A TOUGH GUY WHEN WE
AREN'T REALLY SURE WHAT ALL
HAPPENED.
BUT WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT SANCTIONS THAT TRUMP ISN'T
I THOUGHT IMPLEMENTING FROM THE
BEGINNING, THINGS THAT CONGRESS
ALREADY VOTED ON, BIPARTISAN, TO
IMPLEMENT ON RUSSIA BASED ON
THINGS THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN
GENERAL FROM BEGINNING TO END.
SO THAT'S WHAT HE DISAGREES WITH
HER ON?
I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM
ON ALLOWING THAT STUFF TO JUST
SLIDE.
>>JAYAR MAKE A GREAT POINT, AND
THANK YOU BECAUSE I NEED TO
CLARIFY THAT.
I'M AGAINST NIKKI
HALEY'S GENERALLY HAWKISH,
NEOCON VIEWS AND HER CALLS FOR
MORE BOMBING, ETC.
BUT ON THIS
SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT
CLARIFICATION IS SO IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THIS WAS ABOUT SANCTIONS
GOING TOWARDS OLIGARCHS WHO HAD
BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH SYRIA'S
CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM.
NOW,
THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY
UNOBJECTIONABLE, EVEN FOR GUYS
LIKE ME WHO DON'T WANT ANY
ESCALATION WITH SYRIA OR RUSSIA.
SO, NUMBER ONE, ON THAT
PARTICULAR ISSUE, YOU'RE WRIGHT,
JAYAR, I'M ON HALEY RATHER THAN
TRUMP'S SIDE.
MACRO ISSUES WHERE
SHE WANTS TO KEEP PUSHING MORE
TOWARDS CONFLICT I'M AGAINST HER
AND MORE WITH TRUMP.
BUT MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THAT IS WHY TRUMP
BLOWS UP OVER THIS, BUT NOT THE
BOMBING.
WHY?
BECAUSE THIS
TOUCHES RUSSIAN FINANCIAL
INTERESTS, AND SO THAT ACTUALLY
HURTS THE OLIGARCHS WHO HE IS IN
BED WITH.
AND THAT'S WHY HE
CAN'T HAVE IT.
THE BOMBING, SOME
PEOPLE DIE, WHATEVER.
A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE DYING IN SYRIA, AS
LONG AS YOU DON'T HIT THE
RUSSIANS I THINK WE WILL BE OKAY
AND THAT MAKES ME LOOK TOUGH,
BUT IF MY FRIENDS IN RUSSIA HAVE
THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS FROZEN, THEY
ARE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT
THAT.
THAT'S WHY HE FLIPPED OUT
OVER THIS.
>>RIGHT, AND THERE'S ALSO ONE
OTHER COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE,
AND IT'S ABOUT JUST THE OPTICS
OF EVERYTHING GOING ON RIGHT
NOW.
YOU SAY YOU AGREE A LITTLE
MORE WITH TRUMP'S STRATEGY OR
FOREIGN POLICY, BUT REMEMBER,
THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE IS THAT
TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A STRATEGY OR
A FOREIGN POLICY.
SO THE
INTERNATIONAL, YOU KNOW, TO
OTHER COUNTRIES, RIGHT, TO OUR
ALLIES, TO OTHER PLAYERS, THEY
LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT
NOW, AND HOW IS ANYONE GOING TO
TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE AT ITS
WORD?
HOW IS ANYONE GOING TO
EXPECT ANY TYPE OF STABILITY
WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S
DOING?
HE CHANGES HIS MIND
DAY-TO-DAY, ESPECIALLY ON BIG
ISSUES LIKE SYRIA.
I MEAN, TWO
FRIDAYS AGO WE WERE DOING A
STORY ABOUT HOW HE WANTS TO PULL
OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, TAKE
THE TROOPS OUT AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE, AND THE FOLLOWING
FRIDAY HE'S DROPPING BOMBS AND
GETTING MORE INVOLVED, SO HE'S
JUST WING THIS DAY BY DAY AND
CHANGING HIS MIND, AND WHILE
NIKKI HALEY IS MAKING STATEMENTS
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ALREADY
RENEGED ON, THINK ABOUT HOW THAT
LOOKS TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
>>THAT'S A GREAT POINT, ONE
LAST POINT OF CLARIFICATION, YOU
ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
TRUMP DOES
NOT HAVE A STRATEGY.
HE DOES NOT
HAVE A POLICY.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A
POLICY ON ANYTHING.
SO I AGREE
WITH THE RESULT OF HIS INSTINCT
OF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, I DON'T
WANT TO GET MIRED IN SYRIA.
THAT'S WHAT I AGREE WITH.
I
DON'T WANT TO PUSH INTO SYRIA
AND I DON'T WANT TO PUSH TOWARD
MORE WAR.
NOW, HAVING SAID THAT,
THE MIXED MESSAGES WE ARE
SENDING TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
IS INSANITY.
BECAUSE THEY ARE
JUST SITTING BACK GOING, WAIT,
HOW DO I REACT?
BECAUSE FIRST OF
ALL WHENEVER ANY TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAYS
SOMETHING I HAVE TO WAIT, I HAVE
TO WAIT UNTIL TRUMP TWEETS ABOUT
IT. IS IT TRUE OR NOT?
BECAUSE
THIS GUY IS A TOTAL FRICKIN'
CLOWN, SO HE DOESN'T EVEN
COMMUNICATE TO HIS OWN U.N.
AMBASSADOR, HE HAD TO TELL REX
TILLERSON TO STOP NEGOTIATIONS
WITH NORTH KOREA WHICH HE THEN
RESTARTED AND BRAGGED ABOUT
AFTER FIRING TILLERSON, SO NO
ONE HAS ANY IDEA WHAT IS GOING
ON BECAUSE TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON.
TO ANA'S POINT NOT ONLY IS HE
CHANGING THE STANCE HIS
OFFICIALS ARE SAYING, HE OFTEN
CHANGES HIS OWN STANCE.
>>THAT'S RIGHT.
>>SO THE WHOLE WORLD IS WAITING
ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEAT
LIKE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN
NEXT?
