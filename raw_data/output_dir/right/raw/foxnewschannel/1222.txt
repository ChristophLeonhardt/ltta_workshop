1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:00,440
YESTERDAY.

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,808
POLICE SAY THEY DO NOT KNOW THE

3
00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:06,013
IDENTITY OF THE SHOOTER AND ONLY

4
00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:06,780
HAVE A SKETCH.

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,182
ERIC: LOOKING PAST THE SINGAPORE

6
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:10,550
SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN, THE

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,485
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS NOW

8
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:12,853
CONFIRMING TO FOX NEWS THAT THEY

9
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,421
ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

10
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:16,023
PLANNING A POTENTIAL

11
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:18,191
FACE-TO-FACE SIT-DOWN BETWEEN

12
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:19,059
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUSSIAN

13
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:19,726
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN.

14
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:21,328
THIS OF COURSE COMES AMID

15
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:23,363
SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER'S

16
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:24,631
ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THE

17
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,565
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE AND

18
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,401
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016

19
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,970
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

20
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:33,407
COME UP IF BOTH OF THESE WORLD

21
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:34,141
LEADERS SIT DOWN TOGETHER.

22
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,610
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IF THIS DOES

23
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,311
COME OFF -- THIS SUMMIT DOES

24
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:38,612
OCCUR?

25
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:41,481
DR. GRANT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY

26
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:44,351
AND MILITARY ANALYST AND ALSO

27
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:45,419
PRESIDENT OF AN INDEPENDENT

28
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:45,886
RESEARCH.

29
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:47,487
DR. GRANT, YOU HAVE A TWITTER

30
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,690
PHOTO WHICH IS FASCINATING IT

31
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,590
SHOWS GORBACHEV AND REAGAN

32
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,225
MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

33
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:54,394
85.

34
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:57,731
YOU WRITE IN IT -- CAN YOU TELL

35
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,765
US ABOUT THAT AND IT IS ENTICING

36
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:01,168
TO THINK OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

37
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:02,969
HE'S A NEW YORKER.

38
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,870
HE'S BLUNT, DIRECT, VERY FRANK.

39
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,774
HE'S GOING TO TAKE NO GUFF, YOU

40
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:08,942
KNOW, FROM PUTIN.

41
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:10,177
I THINK HE WOULD SIT RIGHT

42
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:11,411
DIRECTLY AND TELL HIM WHAT HE

43
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:11,745
THINKS.

44
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,780
>> AND HE CAN BE VERY SMOOTH.

45
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,849
SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH REAGAN AND

46
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:17,584
GORBACHEV IN GENEVA WAS, YOU

47
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:19,486
KNOW, GORBACHEV WANTED TO TALK

48
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:20,787
ABOUT STAR WARS, REAGAN WANTED

49
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:22,189
TO TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS.

50
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,191
IT WENT ON OVER TWO DAYS, AND

51
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:26,093
THERE WERE SHOUTING MATCHES THAT

52
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:28,462
OCCURRED, AND ONE WOULD SAY OH,

53
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:30,197
RANT AND RAVE AND GET UP, BUT IN

54
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:32,132
TEND, THE TWO LEADERS -- BUT IN

55
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:35,469
THE END, THE TWO LEADERS SET THE

56
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,337
PATH TOWARDS ANOTHER THREE

57
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,272
SUMMITS AND AN ARMS CONTROL

58
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:39,606
TREATY.

59
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:40,974
SUMMIT IS A GOOD THING.

60
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:42,509
ERIC: I WOULD WORRY IF THEY ARE

61
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,443
SHOUTING BUT I GUESS IT TURNED

62
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:44,111
OUT OKAY.

63
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:48,949
IN THIS DAY AND AGE , YOU HAVE

64
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:54,387
SYRIA, INVASION OF UKRAINE,

65
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:55,856
ELECTION INTERFERENCE, ALL THESE

66
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:56,990
ACTIONS AS WELL AS RUSSIAN

67
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,625
MEDDLING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,

68
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,628
SERGEY LAVROV GOING TO PYONGYANG

69
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:03,530
TO MEET CAN KIM JONG-UN TO GUM

70
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,265
UP THE WORKS OF THIS POTENTIAL

71
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:06,466
SUMMIT, WHAT DOES CHANGE IF

72
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,502
ANYTHING IN TERMS OF RUSSIAN

73
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:09,068
BEHAVIOR?

74
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,470
>> LET'S ROLL IT BACK.

75
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,571
TRUMP MENTIONED IN MARCH THAT HE

76
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:13,440
WAS OPEN TO A SUMMIT WITH PUTIN.

77
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,308
PUTIN IS IN A TOUGH SPOT.

78
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:17,844
HIS ECONOMY IS VERY WEAK.

79
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:19,312
IT'S SMALLER GDP THAN

80
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:19,780
CALIFORNIA'S.

81
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,482
HE'S BEEN VERY MILITARILY

82
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:23,250
AGGRESSIVE, SO THERE ARE A

83
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,985
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PUTIN AND

84
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:25,752
TRUMP SHOULD TALK ABOUT.

85
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,254
SYRIA IS TOP OF THE LIST, ALSO

86
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:29,256
THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE.

87
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:32,292
AND LET'S NOT FORGET, ERIC, THAT

88
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,895
RUSSIA HAS SOME VERY VERY NASTY

89
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:35,629
CYBER CAPABILITIES.

90
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,031
THE FBI WARNED US JUST THIS WEEK

91
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:40,033
TO TURN OFF OUR ROUTERS BECAUSE

92
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,569
OF A RUSSIAN-LINKED HACKING

93
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:42,869
GROUP.

94
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,337
SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS

95
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:47,307
THAT RUSSIA IS DOING TO

96
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:48,809
DESTABILIZE EVERYTHING FROM THE

97
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:50,410
CYBERSPACE TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS

98
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,011
DEVELOPMENT.

99
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,346
THEY HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

100
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:54,948
THAT'S WHY I WOULD BE IN FAVOR

101
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,416
OF SEEING THEM SIT DOWN AND TALK

102
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,918
AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE.

103
00:02:57,918 --> 00:02:59,853
ERIC: WOULD TALKING, WOULD THAT

104
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:01,822
DETER PUTIN'S OBJECTIVES AND THE

105
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:03,089
ACTIONS THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE

106
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,758
TAKING AT OUR EXPENSE?

107
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:05,826
>> I WOULDN'T EXPECT ONE

108
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,127
DISCUSSION TO FIX ANYTHING, BUT

109
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,562
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY TRUMP WOULD

110
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,697
WANT TO MEET PERSONALLY WITH

111
00:03:10,697 --> 00:03:12,666
PUTIN IN A ONE-ON-ONE FORMAT.

112
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,936
THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE OF SMALLER

113
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,137
THE POTENTIAL IS.

114
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:19,105
LISTEN, AT SOME POINT, THEY ARE

115
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,807
GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE

116
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,042
OUTCOME IN SYRIA.

117
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,010
THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THAT.

118
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,745
AND WE'VE SEEN SOME HINTS FROM

119
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:26,646
THE RUSSIAN SIDE THAT THEY MAY

120
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,682
WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

121
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:30,050
ARMS CONTROL AT SOME POINT IN

122
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,152
THE FUTURE, AMAZING AS THAT

123
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:32,485
SOUNDS.

124
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:34,988
SO THE AGENDA IS SO BIG THAT I

125
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:36,056
THINK IT WOULD BE VERY

126
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:36,489
APPROPRIATE.

127
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:37,624
I WOULDN'T EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE

128
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,426
RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR IMMEDIATELY.

129
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,728
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO KEEP

130
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:43,763
UP THAT STRONG MILITARY

131
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:46,199
DETERRENT AND THEN SEE WHAT

132
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,667
POSSIBLY -- WHAT OUTCOME WE

133
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,869
COULD LOOK FOR.

134
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,670
ERIC: WHAT WOULD YOU SEE IN

135
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,638
TERMS OF SYRIA?

136
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:52,672
ASSAD ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

137
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:54,808
>> RIGHT, EXACTLY, BUT THE FACT

138
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,710
IS WE CAN'T WITHDRAW COALITION

139
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,445
FORCES FROM SYRIA REALLY UNTIL

140
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:01,748
WE SEE SOME DIMINISHING OF

141
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:02,749
RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN ACTIVITY IN

142
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:03,183
THAT SPHERE.

143
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,718
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO TALK WITH

144
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:08,054
RUSSIA ON A FREQUENT BASIS ABOUT

145
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:09,522
DECONFLICTING OUR FORCES.

146
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,458
DON'T FORGET THAT OUR AIR FORCES

147
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,093
FACE THE RUSSIANS ALMOST EVERY

148
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:13,460
DAY.

149
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,862
WE HE SEE RUSSIAN JETS TRYING TO

150
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:17,764
MANEUVER AROUND OUR AIR FORCES

151
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:19,466
AND OUR AIR FORCE USUALLY LOCK

152
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,166
THEM UP.

153
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:20,466
OKAY?

154
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,968
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK

155
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:22,235
AT.

156
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:23,470
THERE HAS TO BE SOME DISCUSSION

157
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,770
THERE.

158
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,372
THERE ARE PLENTY OF ISSUES WITH

159
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:26,773
SYRIA TO DISCUSS.

160
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,010
ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO SEE RUSSIA

161
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,377
CONTAINED.

162
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:31,544
THEY ARE GOING TO BEHAVE BADLY.

163
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:32,746
WE NEED TO CONTAIN THEM.

164
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,214
ERIC: WE APPARENTLY STRUCK OUT

165
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:37,651
AND KILLED A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN

166
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:39,719
CONTRACTORS A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN

167
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:42,289
THERE WAS AN ALLEGED ATTACK ON

168
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:46,259
ONE OF OUR BASES.

169
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,827
YOU MENTIONED FANCY BEAR,

170
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,562
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES THAT

171
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:50,330
ACTUALLY HACKED INTO OUR

172
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,830
ELECTION SYSTEM.

173
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,465
THEY HACKED INTO THE ILLINOIS

174
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:54,067
ELECTION SYSTEM DURING THE 2016

175
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,068
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

176
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,836
HERE'S WHAT THE "WALL STREET

177
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:59,039
JOURNAL" SAYS ABOUT THAT AND THE

178
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,106
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE.

179
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:01,274
QUOTE, A MEETING THAT WOULD

180
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:02,175
BRING TO THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE

181
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:04,711
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST

182
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:05,779
ENIGMATIC POLITICAL

183
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,613
RELATIONSHIPS, MEETING MR. PUTIN

184
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,415
LAST YEAR ON THE SIDE LINES OF

185
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,250
THE G 20 SUMMIT MEETING IN

186
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,085
GERMANY, MR. TRUMP VOICED

187
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:14,955
CONCERNS ABOUT RUSSIAN INTER

188
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:15,488
CONCERNS ABOUT RUSSIAN INTE

189
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:17,324
