00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,380
When it comes to car safety Sweden has a pretty good reputation.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,039
And it’s based in fact.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,559
Sweden has one of the world’s lowest rates
of traffic fatalities - only 2.8 deaths for

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,060
every 100,000 people

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,180
Here’s how.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,300
As Swedish society became motorized fatalities
quickly began to rise.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,480
The number of deaths on the roads more than
doubled between 1950 and 1970

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,510
One of the reasons was the majority of cars
were left-hand drive imports being driven

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,300
on the left-hand side of the road.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,579
It means the driver is closer to the curb
and further away from the centre of the road,

11
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,250
which makes overtaking much harder, as the
driver can’t see around the car in front.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,320
Something which makes head-on collisions much
more likely.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,260
But on September 3rd 1967 the Swedish Government
made a big change in the name of safety.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,060
"Sweden decides to switch from left to right!"

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,200
The country changed to driving on the right side of the road.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,760
Its traffic infrastructure was
completely revamped in just one day -

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,820
that included changing 360,000 road signs.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,110
Understandably, safety was a huge focus.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,470
The Government created a special team, the
‘Rightlane Driving Commision’

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,260
to make sure the changeover went without incident.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,920
Speed limits in urban areas were reduced.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,780
Outside of towns they were introduced where
previously they hadn’t existed.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,960
‘H Day’, for högertrafik, Swedish for
‘right traffic’ even had its very own song.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,620
There were plenty of other every day reminders
too like these helpful glasses or H-Day underwear.

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,500
The operation was deemed such a success, the
government formed

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,800
The Swedish Road Safety Agency the very next year.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,880
Some of the first things it achieved?

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,920
Lowering speed limits, and making seat belts
and motorcycle helmets law.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,740
Meanwhile, the country’s biggest car maker, Volvo, invented the industry-changing

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,680
3-point safety belt, giving up the patent so any automaker

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,740
could use it in their vehicles.

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,580
More than a million people worldwide are thought

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,920
to have been saved as a result.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,629
Since the beginnings of the Swedish Road Safety
Agency, fatalities dropped from 1307 in 1970

35
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,030
to 263 in 2015

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,439
What makes that even more astonishing is that
in the same period the number of vehicles

37
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,100
on the roads more than doubled.

38
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,569
A lot of this is possible because Sweden is
one of the wealthier countries in the world.

39
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,129
It’s invested a lot of money in road infrastructure,
separating cyclists and pedestrians from traffic

40
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,450
-- and strictly policing speed limits and
drink driving.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:51,260
In fact, the richer the country, the lower
the number of fatalities generally.

42
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,520
The ultimate goal is 'Vision Zero' - where there
aren’t any deaths on Sweden’s roads at all

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,720
For many countries there’s still a trade-off
between mobility and the deaths that come

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,470
as a result of it.

45
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,879
In Sweden, safety has been the priority over
speed and convenience, since H-Day,

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:00:00,000
September 3rd 1967.
