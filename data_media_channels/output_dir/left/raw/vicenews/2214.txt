1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
if God forbid it ever turns into a

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,419
full-blown conflict from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a submarine</font>

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,830
warfare angle that place can just turn

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,240
into like a knife fight in a phone booth

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,160
hi I'm Ryan faith defense a national

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">security editor for vice news and I'll</font>

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,580
be answering your<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions today on the</font>

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,590
line hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan thanks for coming on the</font>

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,340
show and so we have a pretty global crew

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,449
with a bunch of interesting questions

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,150
about issues around the world fitting

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,890
for our defense and national security

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,559
editor so let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it started with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam</font>

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,360
property who's calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> us from New York</font>

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,660
New<font color="#CCCCCC"> York well I ran thanks for having me</font>

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,879
just to get right into it I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,190
know how you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future of US</font>

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,410
military strategy particularly in the

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,300
Middle East I think over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few</font>

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,460
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen us support for the</font>

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,190
Saudi campaign in Yemen um pretty much

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,559
one hundred percent support and does

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,000
that really fit in with our own national

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,750
interests going forward bird and I'd

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,890
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how ash Carter the new</font>

26
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,870
defense secretary might influence top

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,880
well that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a whole great set</font>

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,500
of questions and actually good thing

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,930
with ash Carter because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think change</font>

30
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,400
spoke to ash Carter interviewed him and

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that should be coming up pretty soon</font>

32
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,659
Middle East military<font color="#E5E5E5"> study for the u.s.</font>

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,220
is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a hash right now</font>

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,220
there's sort of a default reflux

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,990
position that we have that as soon as

36
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,159
something happens and we get very<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset</font>

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,840
and we send John Kerry over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there go</font>

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,460
you'll let everybody and make them try

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,009
to go to the negotiating table so our

40
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,350
strategy and Yemen isn't wildly

41
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,079
different from that now the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,159
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really interesting is that</font>

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,630
that's not really what the Saudis are

44
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,020
after and so is this sort of reflex on

45
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. part and the difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

46
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,619
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Saudi approach going to be</font>

47
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,320
does that reveals some sort of parting

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,700
of the ways or sort of you know that

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,869
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting of the minds between</font>

50
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,990
those two groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore more broadly I</font>

51
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,490
think the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really got people</font>

52
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,350
rattled you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see maybe a bigger</font>

53
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,299
issue in the long term is the activity

54
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the north and Syria and Iraq because</font>

55
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,030
you know this whole Saudi Iranian proxy

56
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,380
war struggle throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Middle East</font>

57
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,000
is already kind of a horrible mess to

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,270
begin with and all the Isis ISIL<font color="#CCCCCC"> dash</font>

59
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,940
whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to move</font>

60
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,130
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that made an already</font>

61
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,080
disastrous car wreck<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a bit bloodier</font>

62
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,590
and Messier but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I think the u.s. is</font>

63
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,860
probably gonna be for the most part

64
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,310
non-interventionist and just have a

65
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,160
fairly steady pro negotiation stance on

66
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,930
Yemen thank you not that welcome so

67
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,570
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming on a time Ryan we got</font>

68
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,360
another question from coastal on so who

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">muslins calling us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from Toronto and</font>

70
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,940
what's ahead hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-signer I hi to my</font>

71
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,200
question I have two separate questions

72
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,150
my first question is about private

73
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,880
military contractors or pmcs<font color="#CCCCCC"> um have we</font>

74
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen an increase in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PMC's throughout the</font>

75
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,170
world and have their roles expanded and

76
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,720
if they have you think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a threat</font>

77
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,400
to global security or something that can

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">help safety in the longer there has been</font>

79
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">an increase and part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this goes back</font>

80
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the peace dividend at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

81
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,290
Cold<font color="#E5E5E5"> War and you know armies used to</font>

82
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,150
hire their own cooks you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

83
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,500
uniform to go do a lot of sort of

84
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,620
maintenance tasks and PMC is absurd that

85
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,210
would serve a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> boost in the size of</font>

86
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,610
PMC's so now contractors providing a lot

87
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,430
of behind the line services and then

88
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,420
there's certainly an expansion that

89
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've seen in places like Iraq with</font>

90
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,080
black water and other contracting firms

91
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward in the future it's really</font>

92
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,050
still a little bit hard to tell where

93
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,190
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going because the</font>

94
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,600
changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

95
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,400
industry have been just spectacularly

96
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,180
you know pervasive and immense at one

97
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,470
remove for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> as hiring</font>

98
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,450
contractors to do private security as

99
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,670
bodyguards you can say okay now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

100
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,170
is going to take care of President X

101
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,970
that the US isn't putting guys in

102
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,920
uniforms who are standing around where

103
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,830
angel rivas flags as bodyguards and so

104
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,690
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a delamination</font>

105
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,060
there the flip side is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also makes</font>

106
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,880
humanitarian intervention a lot easier

107
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,260
if you prepare private contractors with

108
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,180
local troops so the private contractors

109
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,350
are picking up the communications

110
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,780
airlift you know some of the very high

111
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,340
tech high maintenance stuff and the

112
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,870
local folks are providing the manpower

113
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,030
it reduces the political threshold for

114
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,150
intervention so you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of a lot</font>

115
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different things are really sort of</font>

116
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,298
carrying not caring but pulling the

117
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,680
field very very sharply in different

118
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,289
directions I suspect this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

119
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,660
continue because we regard contractor

120
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,230
casualties

121
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,880
much differently than we do national

122
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,220
soldier casualties and it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font>

123
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send money and somebody else's guns</font>

124
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,750
than it is to send your own soldiers now

125
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,870
whether that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> beneficial or</font>

126
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,050
reduce tensions that's there's no real

127
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,690
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer on that one but it is</font>

128
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,740
something definitely to keep an eye on

129
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,120
but thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> excellent my second</font>

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,920
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of away from PMC's and</font>

131
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,140
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the Arctic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada</font>

132
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,880
I've been hearing news of the news<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,120
our soldiers doing exercise activities

134
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,950
in the north and with global warming

135
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,930
it's becoming easier to traverse through

136
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,820
the north and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that the Arctic</font>

137
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,170
is going to come sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hot spot for</font>

138
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,300
military's to go there and what

139
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries would be involved well the</font>

140
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,260
Arctic right now is an absolutely

141
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,910
fascinating sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

142
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,110
geopolitical point of view because I

143
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,810
mean for the last 60 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so is it</font>

144
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,220
sort of the flyover country for nuclear

145
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,230
missiles<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as the place</font>

146
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,210
underneath which world war three would

147
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,020
be fought to an extent the you know the

148
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,550
access to shipping routes and the

149
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,230
ability to get large amounts of supplies

150
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,600
in basically from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from the</font>

151
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sea is going to be a big big factor but</font>

152
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,970
the mechanics of how this play out are

153
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,470
going to be a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> strange I mean</font>

154
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,080
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got basically eight countries who</font>

155
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">are sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of camino have their horse</font>

156
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,500
somehow mixed up in all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this right</font>

157
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,850
now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they seem to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a definite</font>

158
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,880
preference for hashing this out while

159
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,230
all out in conference rooms with

160
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,330
terribly bad coffee and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in yammering</font>

161
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,790
about it endlessly that said is the

162
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,840
Russians<font color="#E5E5E5"> have restructured their</font>

163
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,250
military have sort of effectively

<font color="#E5E5E5">created in the Arctic command had a huge</font>

165
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,450
drill it's an article we wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> about we</font>

166
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,210
covered recently because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

167
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,200
stupendously large amount of firepower

168
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,300
given the actual proximate of threats

169
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,410
they be facing and the you know the

170
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,490
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to keep in mind is</font>

171
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,830
that most of the disputed territory is

172
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">underwater so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how how do you</font>

173
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">how are you going to have that fight and</font>

174
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,800
you've got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things on</font>

175
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,960
that as one is that the Arctic Ocean is

176
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,230
very shallow it's a paratively so this

177
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of terrain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involves submarine</font>

178
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,460
warfare might you know 10 or 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 30</font>

179
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,840
years down the road find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

180
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,930
home for that and but in addition to

181
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,090
that is you've also got the the fact of

182
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ice packs because even if they're</font>

183
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,560
broken up they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

184
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,840
a and those make for a very messy

185
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,970
acoustic environment and very hard for a

186
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,440
lot of you know surface combatants to

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,730
move through so if if God forbid it ever

188
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,950
turns into a full-blown conflict from a

189
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,300
submarine warfare angle that place can

190
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,560
just turn into like a knife fight in a

191
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,450
phone booth it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get really</font>

192
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,840
ugly quickly so that's it's going to be

193
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,360
interesting but I don't I think that a

194
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,740
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the military preparations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

195
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,440
now are to be seen as able to be being

196
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,300
able to respond rather than necessarily

197
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,940
planning on going and fighting you know

198
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,139
you want at least show that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

199
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,700
some capable i mean all of these stuff

200
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,320
that the that<font color="#E5E5E5"> canada's doing in the High</font>

201
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,540
Arctic is reflecting a capacity change

202
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,340
rather than necessarily like you know

203
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,169
putting 10 divisions of guys up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font>

204
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:25,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellis near</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> island to get very cold</font>

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,830
right thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

206
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,590
thanks goes on so moving moving away

207
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,620
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Arctic we got a question from</font>

208

Drew who wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what your opinion</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about Ukraine is he drew asked do you</font>

Ukraine as an act of<font color="#CCCCCC"> war zone are</font>

212
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,660
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a modern-day Korea</font>

213
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,910
despite fire being exchanged on a daily

214
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,190
basis and treaty violations taking part

215
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,530
on both sides is there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope for</font>

216
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,200
progress or do you see a relation of

217
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,780
hostilities as inevitable it's that

218
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,550
excellent<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I think the thing</font>

219
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's sort of important about reading</font>

220
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,270
the negotiations and developments in

221
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,490
Ukraine and guards or treaties and

222
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">ceasefires and all this stuff is that</font>

223
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,270
there's an enormous<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between</font>

224
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,800
coming to the negotiating table and

225
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,680
actually giving a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> goddamn about</font>

226
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,120
what happens to the negotiating table

227
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,669
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think from the broader Russian</font>

228
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,080
hybrid warfare approaches that they

229
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
understand that all they need to do is

230
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,850
show up and you know make big

231
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,910
unverifiable promises and that's

232
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,990
sufficient to check off the box for them

233
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,669
being contributed you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know or being</font>

234
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,779
helpful in making a positive

235
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:39,479
contribution and I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

236
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,820
compelling reason why the Russians why

237
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,429
the price is too high for Russia to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

238
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,600
you know higher than they want to pay

239
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,910
right now and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long as one</font>

240
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,310
side in a fight believes that they

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,750
to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fight there's just no</font>

242
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,270
no real way around that looking a little

243
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,650
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> further forward if you look at the</font>

244
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,510
territory that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Putin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of carved out</font>

245
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,940
for greater novorossiya is it goes all

246
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,100
the way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Transnistria and Moldova</font>

247
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,150
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know it's on the other</font>

248
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,730
side of Ukraine I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that will</font>

249
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">be possible for them to expand this</font>

250
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,589
fight that far west but that sort of

251
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:11,850
rhetorical space that he's buying

252
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,980
himself means that there's always going

253
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,200
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some money no poor downtrodden</font>

254
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,660
Russians somewhere that needs saving and

255
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,550
needs saving with the help of<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you</font>

256
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">know motor rifle unit or two so yeah I</font>

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be maybe</font>

258
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,360
something's gonna look a lot more like

259
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,190
the Balkans in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being very</font>

260
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,270
messy and very<font color="#E5E5E5"> drawn out and you know</font>

261
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">before it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to come to any sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

262
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,740
nice quick crisp conclusion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dad</font>

263
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,910
thank you drew<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes so let's go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

264
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,279
to our skype colors we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a mr. unread</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Grossman who's calling us from</font>

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,529
Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC so let's say at honoree</font>

267
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,839
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan so I have two questions first</font>

268
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,260
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so France has a purchase order from</font>

269
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,070
Russia for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two assault amphibious</font>

270
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,710
assault ships and they have yet to fill

271
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,900
this order since the Crimea war started

272
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,460
if Russia gets these highly capable

273
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,010
Mistral assault ships what kind of

274
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,610
consequences can we possibly expect in

275
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,850
the Caucasus and the Ukraine well thank

276
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for the question mr. all</font>

277
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,550
ship deal is actually one of the most

278
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,200
fascinating stories out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

279
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,630
it's it's one that sort of keeps having

280
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,070
a load of deeper layers and you can see

281
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,680
keep peeling away the two things to sort

282
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,300
of keep in mind for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for the broader</font>

283
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,910
deal is one is the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> role that is</font>

284
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,350
playing for the ship French shipbuilding

285
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,120
industry which is a very dire straits

286
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,760
and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be easy</font>

287
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,380
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the president to sort of say from</font>

288
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,089
sorry guys you know you're just add a

289
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,040
couple billion dollars because they've

290
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,880
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> going through a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

291
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">consolidation the other part that's</font>

292
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,350
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth noticing is that Russia you</font>

293
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,270
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much value is its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks of</font>

294
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,040
itself as a weapons exporter so they

295
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
don't really import complex systems

296
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,510
often and when they do it's it's usually

297
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,670
a big indicator and the deal particular

298
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,050
on the second ship is that the French

299
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,350
workers would be going to rush

300
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,140
to help them build the ship you know

301
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of sorts there's a technology</font>

302
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,490
transfer agreement and since the end of

303
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,130
the Soviet Union<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Russian ability to</font>

304
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,830
build large warships is really kind of

305
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,240
declined drastically so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

306

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs the even capital and do it in</font>

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,460
if you don't ever do anything you know

315
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,320
ever conductor landing is that you can

316
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,720
hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of things at threat and</font>

317
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,470
particularly start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting out to the</font>

318
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,420
Med then again that sort of opens up

319
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,860
there the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones going out to a lot</font>

320
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,480
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us book and the Pacific is a really</font>

321
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,940
big growth area for amphibious right now

322
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,990
but I'm not necessarily certain what

323
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,500
they would be planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it I</font>

324
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,280
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

325
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,020
capability more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else but</font>

326
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,560
it's in the longer term from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Russian</font>

327
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,790
perspective is that Russia doesn't

328
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,160
really need amphibious to do

329
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,800
expeditionary warfare and you know

330
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,940
there's sort of a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where</font>

331
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'd be projecting power to how they</font>

332
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,410
intend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain it so I think this is</font>

333
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe even right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them a learning</font>

334
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,780
experience more than it is you know a

335
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,010
dagger that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to have and go</font>

336
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,600
poke somebody in the eye with directly

337
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,920
yeah but yeah thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much so my</font>

338
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,070
second question is on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mitt Romney in</font>

339
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,230
the 2012 presidential election cited

340
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,200
Russia as one of America's top threats

341
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,640
and you know he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sort of scoffed at</font>

342
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
for saying this because at the time

343
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,470
other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on and Russians</font>

344
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,900
recently you know have used the rhetoric

345
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,570
that NATO is their biggest threat and of

346
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,240
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course with</font>

347
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,090
defense preparedness is that many NATO

348
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,790
countries haven't fulfilled the

349
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,410
expectation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they use that they</font>

350
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,840
spend a certain amount of their gdp on

351
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,660
defense do you think that NATO is

352
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,170
unprepared and then will the United

353
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,560
States full fulfill its promise of

354
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,970
mutual protection well that a case of

355
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,529
that's I mean that's actually sort of

356
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the big question for NATO</font>

357
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,939
I mean is NATO is the future of NATO a

358
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,350
political organization or is it to be a

359
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">military alliance and you know there's a</font>

360
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,689
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know god forbid that there's</font>

361
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,310
ever a major war but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it would</font>

362
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,139
turn out very it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would sell very poorly</font>

363
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,470
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US if it was basically US troops</font>

364
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,959
in u.s. equipment and going over for

365
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,310
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bothered of you</font>

366
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,649
know even spend a minimal amount of

367
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,680
money but hopefully that won't you know

368
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,779
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be getting to that point in</font>

369
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of Russia beans are the great big</font>

370
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,879
threat is I can't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Romney's</font>

371
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,720
thinking on it directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is</font>

372
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,389
worthwhile noting that you know in this

373
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:58,740
scoffing there's people say no of course

374
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,029
it's China or of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the</font>

375
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,230
Middle East is a bigger threat or so on

376
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,420
and so forth and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've now</font>

377
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,439
got maybe three or four major concerns

378
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:09,930
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just very different flavors</font>

379
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,730
so like when's a vanilla flavored

380
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">threaten yeah there's a chocolate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flood</font>

381
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">threat and the other is a strawberry</font>

382
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,439
threat and so it's would be foolish to

383
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,750
assume that Russia isn't going to be a

384
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,750
threat but I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

385
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,160
necessarily the biggest one I mean if

386
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,569
nothing else<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're really one of the</font>

387
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:28,819
only two people can really wage

388
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:31,649
effective large-scale hi my intensity

389
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,379
full full spectrum operations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

390
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,350
should be on the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade arm but yeah</font>

391
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,379
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you good all right thanks already</font>

392
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,110
so Ryan let's turn it over to Twitter

393
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,000
for a second all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fiche</font>

394
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,439
awesome it's a bunch of really good

395
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,959
questions but I picked this one out and

396
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,290
in light of the Israel Gaza conflict in

397
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,720
2014 and everything that happened there

398
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,730
how far do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> wars can be won and</font>

399
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,370
lost on the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> media front dads are</font>

400
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,420
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a</font>

401
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,399
spectacularly good question I mean this

402
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,470
sort of gets opens up you know five or

403
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,040
six different Hornets nests but Israel

404
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,139
Gaza social media it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

405
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,339
tricky because right now and what we're

406
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot in Ukraine and we've seen</font>

407
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,189
arguably with the color revolutions

408
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:19,350
we've seen arguably with the

409
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,809
israel-palestine conflict is the way

410
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,100
that information is becoming

411
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,860
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used effectively in in</font>

412
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,139
conflicts and I mean you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font>

413
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,610
information playing a war<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know role</font>

414
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,410
at st.<font color="#CCCCCC"> World War</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two with breaking codes</font>

415
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,839
or a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of propaganda or sending</font>

416
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,339
you know balloons of messages into the

417
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,410
North Korea I mean not<font color="#CCCCCC"> World</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> War two of</font>

418
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,720
it that's happened more recently but

419
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,980
what we've sort of seen is that the

420
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability for information to flood very</font>

421
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,980
quickly narratives to get established

422
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,430
very quickly is the public reaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

423
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,699
getting more dialed up a I think the

424
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,959
political<font color="#CCCCCC"> process is becoming a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

425
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,269
sensitive to it arguably social media

426
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,610
killed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israeli incursion into</font>

427
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,910
Lebanon in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid-2000s and I think</font>

428
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we're seeing in right now in</font>

429
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,420
Ukraine is going to be a really good

430
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,120
taste of what's to come as nations get a

431
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,410
lot more effective and aggressive about

432
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,290
leveraging information operations I

433
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,660
don't know if you can win a war with

434
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,250
social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I it's not crazy tough</font>

435
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,600
to discuss whether or not you could lose

436
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,389
a war with social media and I think

437
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,920
we're going to be a long time driving

438
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,439
out what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

439
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,420
mutating fast enough towards clearly in

440
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,569
motion but it's not at a final<font color="#E5E5E5"> state so</font>

441
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:36,399
this is sort of a something I'm keeping

442
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,360
in my very much my<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to watch going</font>

443
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,100
forward because it's it's tricky and

444
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,050
ugly yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we're getting near the</font>

445
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,250
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show but we've got another</font>

446
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,959
skype color I'd like for you to say hey

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,050
to let's say hey to Hannah who's calling

448
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,920
us also<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Washington</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DC hi Ryan so my</font>

449
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is actually got to do with it</font>

450
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:01,089
asia-pacific my first<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is who do</font>

451
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:03,100
you think is a bigger threat to peace

452
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,929
and stability in the region China or

453
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,380
North Korea and my second question

454
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,780
maritime security is a huge issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

455
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,909
region right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was wondering what</font>

456
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:14,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">your thoughts on how the US should</font>

457

respond or deal with a Chinese actions

458
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,150
in the South China Sea this is actually

459
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,709
it's a great set of questions last

460
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,659
summer<font color="#CCCCCC"> we went to the rim of the Pacific</font>

461

exercise to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how nations</font>

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,159
are engaging and it was China's first

trip to rim of the Pacific as a

469
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,280
I think I'm not on this the asia-pacific

470
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">region is incredibly important to the</font>

471
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,789
United States it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been in the past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

472
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,890
is today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will continue to be so in</font>

473
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,440
the future our country<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> established</font>

474
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,409
the rebalance<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy to bring more</font>

475
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,929
forces more effort and more engagement

476
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,780
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very critical region I think</font>

477
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,159
you will find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Marine Corps has</font>

478
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,830
been challenged in order to have the

479
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,650
right force at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right place at the</font>

480
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,039
right time and things like RIMPAC 2014

481
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,289
gives us the opportunity to train

482
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,210
together to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our forces are</font>

483
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,299
ready for any crisis in the future so

484
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,770
the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's sort of emphasizing</font>

485
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,210
the ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have flexibility</font>

486
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">individua to respond flexibly to any</font>

487
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,659
crisis in the region<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some of the</font>

488
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:23,950
concerns that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been about us</font>

489
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">basing in the region get to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

490
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:27,490
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not China or North Korea's</font>

491
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,740
bigger threat and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like you</font>

492
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">know by way of very rough analogies it's</font>

493
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,789
like which dog is a bigger threat you

494
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:35,650
might have a very angry yappy dog that's

495
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,539
very likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite you but you might</font>

496
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:39,280
have like a giant you know Rottweiler

497
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
guard dog that it it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be as</font>

498
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,030
excitable but the bites a lot worse and

499
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,600
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question of which is</font>

500
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,659
a bigger threat is almost a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big</font>

501
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,010
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic and philosophical</font>

502
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,419
exercise because it's you know threats

503
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:53,830
over what<font color="#CCCCCC"> timescale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what kinds of</font>

504
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,970
threats are we talking economic

505
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,039
political stone and so forth now the

506
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,960
maritime security<font color="#CCCCCC"> in South trying to see</font>

507
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,460
thing I think is actually tips my

508
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">judgment about China pretty</font>

509
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,640
significantly because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

510
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,100
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in a very effective way is</font>

511
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of the salami slicing tactics that</font>

512
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:14,530
you see in proliferation and the ability

513
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,710
to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the status of a reef from a</font>

514
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,020
reef to an island from an uninhabited

515
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,090
island to an inhabited<font color="#CCCCCC"> island and sort</font>

516
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,409
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewrite the rules in the ground for</font>

517
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:26,440
subsequent territorial negotiations and

518
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,440
change the facts is in its own way as

519
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
disruptive as Putin's incursions into

520
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,730
Ukraine it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's sort of a</font>

521
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,220
very big breach of you know of patterns

522
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,080
and habits and international protocol

523
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,679
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the fact that china is</font>

524
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,610
being very bold about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their decisions</font>

525
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,409
and very bold about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their path forward</font>

526
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,450
like I know this is all now historically

527
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,280
China this<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of China that are</font>

528
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,140
a thousand miles<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> China of</font>

529
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,590
course they're parts of China is sort of

530
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,030
an interesting leading indicator and

531
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a question now about</font>

532
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,020
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're growing power</font>

533
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,020
their rise is a smooth one or they're

534
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">not they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some ugly</font>

535
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,700
growing pains and adolescent stumbles so

536
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,640
yeah I think but North Korea is so damn

537
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,320
unpredictable you know it's nobody's

538
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,640
going to ever get a notice or memo that

539
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,870
says there's going to be a war in two

540
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,800
weeks it's one of those things we're

541
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,480
just going to walk into by surprise so

542
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,430
it's really hard to say when<font color="#CCCCCC"> would the</font>

543
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,620
other well thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your thoughts</font>

544
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,290
well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

545
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">right Ryan so a one more question before</font>

546
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,890
we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a day we got a tweet here and</font>

547
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,690
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our viewers is wondering will</font>

548
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">future Wars be fought by humans drones</font>

549
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,520
robots are all of the above all of the

550
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,170
above definitely I think that there's

551
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of there's already</font>

552
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">even a lot of focus on man-machine</font>

553
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,640
interfaces and drone you know pairing

554
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,220
units with the drones and how that's

555
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to evolve is going to be a little</font>

556
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,770
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a hard thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure because</font>

557
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,200
there's Anna drones<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily</font>

558
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,850
save manpower they shift where the

559
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,370
manpower is placed so for instance a

560
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,650
drone operation requires a lot bigger

561
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,830
staff in some ways than a that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pilot</font>

562
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,980
does operationally<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

563
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,360
that defense budgets being under

564
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,310
pressure means is they want to be able

565
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,440
to reduce headcount so maybe drones

566
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,330
might not be the way to do it but other

567
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,520
kinds of automation might be the way to

568
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,720
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like on the news from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new Navy</font>

569
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,050
ships but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I aim at the end of the day is</font>

570
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sort of is humans are there</font>

571
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,230
tools you know what's what's more

572
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,880
important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there never really</font>

573
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can't really be teased apart</font>

574
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,780
they're not sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really separable</font>

575
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,530
items but the but now we're getting

576
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,020
capabilities that are enough to really

577
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,220
caused us to reevaluate that equation

578
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,020
yet again so it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be I mean a</font>

579
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of figuring out but I think yeah</font>

580
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to be a blend we just don't</font>

581
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what that blends going to be cool</font>

582
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,210
so Ryan you made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all the way to the</font>

583
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,040
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show munch say goodbye to all</font>

success of amphibious operations will

593
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,230
not only be a measure of us power in the

Pacific but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Marines ability to</font>
