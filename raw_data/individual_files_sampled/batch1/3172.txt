in a bovine world there's a misfit there like the Suicide Squad of the bovine world they they don't want anything to do with with humans he doesn't want you on his back so he's not there to make friends of here he's there - you off and get out of the ring and do his job so you got to do yours and stay on they've been born to do this they've been bred to do this eight seconds of the most of what these Bulls are going to work they do their job and they're right back to living a life of luxury they get fed well they get exercised routinely these Bulls they live a life of luxury when you thought about anime that is terrible misperception there's they're not mistreated at all the bulls are taken care of better than most people take care of their their children you know my job is to stop contractors and try to raise the best bulls or find the best moles to buy to put on my truck to come here to compete at this event they've sold some bulls for two hundred to five hundred thousand dollars they're worth a lot of money so there's nobody going to go do something to them to hurt overtake any kind of chances who's spending two hundred and five hundred thousand dollars on the bull and how do you Rico recoup that investment I see them selling semen out of them for breeding purposes the problems going to be reincarnated that's what I'd want to leave the bucket wheel you know because I mean other rock stars of the cattle industry get to travel to all these cities and compete in front all these fans and stuff and then whenever we're done I get turned out with all the ladies you know so I mean I think it's a pretty good pretty good profession as a bucking bull for sure
