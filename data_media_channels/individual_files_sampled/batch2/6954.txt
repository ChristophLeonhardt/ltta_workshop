yet another great article an investigation by the intercept and Lee falling over they're handling this one so an interesting idea is look there's a lot of Democratic lobbyists and called Democratic lobbies because they give ton of money or they organize and and fundraise for the Democratic Party for Hillary Clinton and add huge sums so so they their favorite candidate the one they raised all that money for loss so I wonder what happened to them great question let's begin to answer it so fine rights lobbying records show that some democratic fundraisers who raise the record amounts of campaign cash for Clinton are now retained by top telecom interests to help repeal the strong net neutrality protections established during the Obama administration now here's when lobbyists watching this go what guy gotta make a living man so yeah these giant companies hire lobbyists like me and so if a Democrats in office I get them to try to kill net neutrality and since I gave them a lot of money a lot of times they listen now Obama didn't after Facebook and Google lobbyists came to the other side in a lot of ways to the rescue anyway and therefore others in office I do what the corporation's tell me to do they want me to kill freedom on there and then I kill freedom on the internet I'm a lobbyist if that's your strong defense Kabbalists have at it Hoss okay but you think it's just that neutrality getting warmed up others are working on behalf of for-profit prisons on detention issues while others still are paid to help corporate interests pushing alongside Trump to weaken financial regulations must be so proud so those are the lobbyists they gave money to Hillary Clinton's yeah I can't you mind your truck gets into all this we're going to weaken financial regulations then they turn around and go great Cubs in office let's weaken financial regulations gee I wonder why we don't trust the corporate Democrats funded by these lobbyists give you some exact numbers in a second at least one prominent Clinton backer is working for a health insurance company on a provision that was included in the House Republican bill to gut the Affordable Care Act remember when Hillary Clinton said we've got to protect Obamacare first of all if Bernie Sanders comes in he wants medicare-for-all well that's a better plan but anyway then that would hurt Obamacare because that's it not as progressive and we would have a more participant that was an insane argument okay fine we got past that we hit the Trump it's gonna kill Obamacare so give me lots and lots of money you'll obvious your Democratic lobbyist give it to me give it to me okay because we're gonna protect Obamacare Oh Trump won oh it doesn't matter just take that same mony and use it to help kill Obamacare gee I wonder why we don't trust the politicians they're both funded by the same guys so why do you always get tax cuts that's what it was in Texas because the rich want tax cuts corporations want tax why do you always get deregulation because giant corporations have fun these parties want deregulation it's not complicated now but let's give you the gruesome details here again fine explains the net neutrality debate is a case in point the biggest fundraisers for the Clinton campaign Democratic lobbyist such as Ingrid Duran visit Roberti Steve Elmendorf Alma tor and RC Sidhu key are now lobbying on behalf of ATT Verizon or Comcast on net neutrality these companies dominate the telecom industry which is working with the Trump administration to unwind one of President Barack Obama's biggest accomplishments again they will say well who do you want their work for I'm a lobbyist of course I'm going to work for AT&T and Verizon and these big guys and of course they want to kill net neutrality you lose your freedom on the internet but they make more money duh but you're missing the point yes that's the problem we have systemic corruption and these lobbyists are at the very heart of that systemic corruption corporations would like to do crony capitalism they'd like to buy off both sides these guys buy off both sides and then when we point that out they go hey you're being so unfair I mean I'm a lobbyist I'm supposed to legally bribe both sides that's the problem alright so and then when you say hey I have a different idea why don't we elect someone who takes small donor money and it's not beholden to these guys they go outrageous radical radical how dare you no no you remember was Cooper kept asking the question almost at every debate CNN Wolf Blitzer it said asked the same question Bernie Sanders are you suggesting that Hillary Clinton has ever changed her vote on any of these issues because of the money she's taken you say with me of course of course she did just look at these are the same guys who want the same results it doesn't matter if Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is in but they told us look in some ways of course in the case of Planned Parenthood it makes a big difference Supreme Court difference big difference but not as much of a difference as we would like it's but a big difference but in some of the other issues now what's the same guys playing the same games who are writing the same checks to both parties so a well-known lobbyist who runs a powerful democratic circles Heather Podesta volunteered for Clinton during the New Hampshire primaries she collected at least four hundred and seven thousand dollars for the campaign machine volunteers she raised four hundred thousand dollars Podesta so obviously she cares about those issues that that they care about right and we're and remember what Hillary said know me and all my supporters here all my corporate Democratic friends we will protect the internet and we you know we we are the protectors of all these progressive things how could you say we're not as progressive as everybody else all right let's find out how progressive Podesta is in recent months Podesta has tweeted from the Center for American Progress ideas conference an event billed as a platform for the quote resist movement and has continued to give cash to congressional Democrats okay that sounds pretty good now I told you that that conference is a sham it's corporate Democrats they didn't invite any progressives and they all got together in a big circle and set off yeah we lost the Donald Trump but it's okay high-five we're gonna run the same people the next time around finance when the same lobbyist so she's tweet oh yeah resist resist so let's see if she actually resisted this Trump administration records show Podesta is lobbied this year on behalf of financial management and insurance giants Prudential and New York life on the fiduciary rule the regulation fought for by the Obama administration that was designed to require financial planning companies tact in the best interest of their clients so I love this because it's a perfect microcosm for what's happening in Washington the Obama administration to their credit says hey you should have a rule where if you are managing someone's money you have to manage it in their best interest not in your own best interest isn't that the most logical obvious rule okay I don't want to give Obama too much credit of course that should be the rule but I'll give him credit cuz in Washington it's not obvious so Heather Podesta champion of progressives like Hillary Clinton now turns around and instead of resisting says now let's get rid of that rule it bothers the corporation that pays my bills so they don't have to worry about your best interest you're only their client no they're gonna worry about their best interest how could you possibly defend that you could defend that if you get paid millions of dollars to defend that now that's one piece of financial regulation a let's go to Steve Elmendorf he's a former senior adviser to Clinton's 2008 run he maintained a high profile role with Clinton in 2016 raising three hundred and forty-one thousand dollars for the campaign he is now on the most prominent corporate lobbyist on Washington DC records show that Elmendorf too lobbied on the fiduciary rule his clients securities industry and financial markets Association a trade group for firms like Prudential has made delaying the rule a major goal and celebrated Trump's move to delay implementation of that rule hashtag resist there's no resistance going on here from some of these corporate Democrats in Washington they're happy they make money either way Elmendorf also representatives United Health which work is working right now to help repeal Obamacare but these people told us they're very job was to protect Obamacare the internet and the financial rules how could you say that Bernie Sanders would be tougher on to Baker's Hillary Clinton went and talked to them and got lots of money from them and and she would have held them to account to really these were some of our top advisors and and fundraisers okay a former Democratic National Committee fundraiser Bill Clinton's days as president Richard Sullivan's served as a major fundraiser Hillary Clinton's campaign last year he bundled at least three hundred and forty five thousand dollars for the campaign according to Federal Election Commission records Sullivan has also registered lobbyist for the public relations and Lobby firm Capitol Council where he works on behalf of private prison giant geo group to convince lawmakers of quote the benefits of public-private partnerships in the delivery of secure residential care in correctional and detention facilities I love that Orwellian euphemism oh the prison industrial complex where we get paid money to imprison Americans on a mass scale the more Americans we imprison right or wrong the more money we get paid well we're just giving them secure residential care and if Hillary Clinton would have won I already gave her three hundred and forty five thousand dollars Donald Trump was great even better the geo group was among the few companies that gave an outright donation to Trump usually use packs these independent expenditures they have their employees here they have more most importantly they give it have their lobbyists give but jerger was like no I don't care I want that guy to win besides which I've got my bases covered I'm paying their lobbyists in case Hillary Clinton wins I've got my lobbyists giving her three hundred forty five thousand loss but lucky for them Trump won so they got even more than they could have imagined they were already gotten I think a new 110 million dollar contract because of the new detention facilities because of his immigration rules cha-ching hashtag resist be wary of Democratic insiders telling you they got their your best interest in mind and then when you say hey maybe the guys pain you all that money are the ones you're serving they go well of course I have to serve them I'm a lobbyist of course I have to serve these giant corporations as they imprison all of you I can't believe that you won't bow your head to such a wonderful system no we don't we hate this system and if you're wondering why voters all across the world keep voting against the establishment especially here in America well you have your answer because this is this a Bushman okay the intercept also has this part the last two points that I think are very very interesting flying says as the interceptors reported lobbyist for Goldman Sachs and the securities industry and financial market association the trade group raised big money for Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee using their sway to pressure the party to adopt policies favorable to their industries and to abandon economic populist messaging that targeted the financial sector so first it's not just Hillary Clinton but it's the d-triple-c those are the guys who are funding all the establishment Democrats in the house so it's systemic to the party I told you I've told you all along it's not personal this is if you set up certain incentives people will follow those incentives so we allow for legal bribes so now the d-triple-c in those House members they take legalized bribes so if you're one and if you were wondering the more important part is wait how come they never run ads and campaigns that are so obvious the American people don't like bankers they don't like big business big business rates even poorer than the media it rates even poorer than politicians so why don't you ever run campaigns against big business I mean even what a Republican like Dave brat pretend to be a populist and ran an anti banker campaign against Eric Cantor is sitting House Majority Leader he beat him even a Republican district in a democratic district anti banker message works even better so why don't they ever use it because they're paid not to use it what have I been telling you all along they are paid to lose this is exactly evidence of that one more thing I've been telling you and you can go back and watch clips for years this is exactly what I warned you about is that in the primary race you wonder why do they why do these corporate Democrats fight Bernie Sanders with every kind of smear and every kind of dirty tacky and when Keith Olson ran for DNC they use the same two smears he asked them why do they do that but when they run against Republicans all of a sudden they talk about humility in it and they put the gloves back on and quiz very rules and all that well as spunk explains for many Democratic insiders there's fortune to be made even in electoral defeat which is hey you know what if the Republicans win I still get paid but if Bernie Sanders wins or a real progressive wins and they up end this system of corruption then I don't get paid that's why progressives are so much more of a threat to corporate Democrats which is unfortunately the great majority the democratic party in Washington in power today there's so much of a bigger threat than Republicans if a Republican wins or Democrat wins these same lobbyists get paid either way but if a progressive wins and you take money out of politics that's when these guys get vicious cuz they say well that's my livelihood I make millions of dollars doing this and if you take that away from me I'm gonna call you a radical I'm gonna call you every name there is I'm not gonna play fair I then all of a sudden these Democrats become lions this is how the system works and you wonder why we started just Democrats and why we insist a state taking small donor money and not corporate money and not PAC bunny because once you start taking that money you are part of the systemic corruption and it's toxic so go to justice Democrats calm we'll have a link for you at the bottom hey if you know if you think that the corporate Democrats are wonderful in this system is great then don't do that go and support you know Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer and Chuck Schumer and all these guys who say everything's fine everything's fine just trust us yeah we're all taking all this money but we're ignoring the money the money would never affect our boss he's okay even going that direction if you want strong progressives who are uncorrupted you go to justice Democrats calm by the way and you know the first pack I ever started and I know that it's weird for in traditional news for someone who's Joey news to start a pack you know what I do it cuz I actually care about the news I hate this system and I know that you hate this system so why don't we in fact over 90% of Americans agree with you and I that the money corrupts politics so if you want to take money out of politics Wolfpack wolf dash pack.com you've got to get that amendment we have to get it and and we have to clean out the system and bring our democracy back that is why if you ever want to see Democrats fight hard never look at them when they're fighting a Republican they'll go super soft on them but you want to see establishment Democrats angry look at their reaction to justice Democrats of Wolfpack because that's and Bernie Sanders now I'm not connected to Bernie Sanders but that's but he's right I supported him because of the policies and because he's honest and you see their reaction to those three things and you'll see what these guys are actually about because no matter what the number one thing they care about is the money they gotta get paid no matter who's in power and their corporate overlords in this case literally they work for these corporations gotta get those laws changed not to your benefit but to their benefit we got to upend the system come do it with us I know what you're
