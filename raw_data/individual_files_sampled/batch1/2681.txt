through his career Donald Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits and angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel they've been ripped off Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's running his business god help us I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one Crump says he'll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China but the clothes he sells are made overseas and low-wage factories he says he wants to put Americans back to work but he games the US visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages he says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people but he seems to have no problem in hiring what'd I miss here truth be told the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy
