1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:02,432
OF A WASHINGTON STATE FLORIST

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:03,800
WHO DECLINED WHEN A LONG-TIME

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,337
CUSTOMER OF HERS ASKED HER TO DO

4
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:07,971
FLOWERS FOR HIS SAME-SEX

5
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:08,338
CEREMONY.

6
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:10,507
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL

7
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:12,776
ARGUMENTS.

8
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:13,377
SENIOR CLINICAL ANALYST

9
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:14,044
BRIT HUME JOINS US TONIGHT.

10
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:15,979
GOOD EVENING.

11
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,913
YOUR REACTION TO THIS RULING.

12
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:18,582
>> I THINK YOU ARE CORRECT WHEN

13
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:21,385
YOU SUGGEST THAT WHILE IT'S NOT

14
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:24,021
AN NARROW VOTE, IT'S AN NARROW

15
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:25,055
HOLDING IN THE SENSE THAT IT

16
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,290
APPLIES FOR INSTANCE IN WHICH

17
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,194
THE COURT FOUND THAT THIS BAKER

18
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:32,796
DIDN'T GET A FAIR HEARING.

19
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:33,430
THE COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS

20
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,032
COMMISSION WAS SO BIASED AGAINST

21
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:39,636
HIM AND BIASED AGAINST THE

22
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:43,507
BAKER'S RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS

23
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:44,274
AND BELITTLED THOSE CONVICTIONS,

24
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:47,177
DESCRIBING THE ARGUMENT AS

25
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:48,912
DESPICABLE, THAT IT WASN'T A

26
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,080
FAIR HEARING AND COULDN'T STAND

27
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,415
PRETTY GIVE SOME RECOGNITION TO

28
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,015
THE IDEA THAT RELIGIOUS

29
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:54,785
CONVICTIONS MAY BE A REASON TO

30
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:58,288
DENY SERVICES IN CERTAIN

31
00:00:58,288 --> 00:00:58,989
CIRCUMSTANCES.

32
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,157
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE

33
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:02,592
CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT BE.

34
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:03,360
A BIT OF FLORIST CASE WILL TELL

35
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,695
US MORE.

36
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:07,798
>> Shannon: TO THE OTHER LEGAL

37
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:09,399
ISSUES, THERE PRESIDENT AND

38
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:11,601
WHETHER OR NOT HE CAN PARDON

39
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:11,935
HIMSELF.

40
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,603
THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T SAY

41
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:14,671
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT HE'S

42
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,574
GETTING A WARNING FROM HIS OWN

43
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:18,308
TOP LAWYER.

44
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,911
>> RUDY GIULIANI WAS SAYING

45
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:21,411
YESTERDAY.

46
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:26,183
SAYING IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS.

47
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,318
HE POINTED OUT THAT IF YOU

48
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:29,019
PARDON HIMSELF, PARDONS DON'T

49
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:32,422
APPLY TO IMPEACHMENT.

50
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:34,057
AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HE

51
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:35,292
CAN PARDON HIMSELF REMAINS AN

52
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:38,361
OPEN QUESTION IN THE SENSE THAT

53
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,130
PARDON POWER IS PRETTY SWEEPING

54
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,198
AND THE PRESIDENT CAN EXERCISE

55
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:43,133
IT AS HE SEES FIT.

56
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:46,236
BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN EXERCISED IN

57
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:48,972
A CASE WHERE A PERSON, A

58
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:49,906
PRESIDENT IS PARDONING HIMSELF.

59
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:51,041
THE CONSTITUTION IS SILENT ON

60
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,209
IT.

61
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,376
THERE IS A PRINCIPLE THAT WE

62
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:54,177
RECOGNIZE WHICH IS THAT NO

63
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:56,680
PERSON SHALL BE THE JUDGE OF HIS

64
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,648
OR HER OWN CASE.

65
00:01:58,648 --> 00:01:59,516
THIS WOULD SEEM TO FLY IN THE

66
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:00,851
FACE OF THAT.

67
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,052
IT'S A DOUBTFUL PROPOSITION THAT

68
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:03,220
HE COULD PARDON HIMSELF.

69
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,222
>> Shannon: IT GOES ALONG WITH

70
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:06,256
THE ADVICE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE

71
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:08,824
YOUR OWN LAWYER.

72
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:12,395
YOU CAN'T BE YOUR OWN JUDGE.

73
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:15,198
THERE IS THIS ISSUE, 1974

74
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:19,069
DECISION CAME FROM WITH IN THE

75
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:19,636
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

76
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:22,639
>> THIS GOES TO THE QUESTION OF

77
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,008
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT COULD BE

78
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:26,776
INDICTED BY ROBERT MILLER.

79
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:28,345
IN THE NIXON ERA, THE JUSTICE

80
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:31,481
DEPARTMENT, LEGAL COUNSEL,

81
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:34,784
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN-HOUSE

82
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:36,720
ATTORNEY DETERMINE THAT A

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,420
PRESIDENT, A SITTING PRESIDENT

84
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,822
COULD NOT BE INDICTED.

85
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:40,991
IT WAS LOOKED AT IN 2,000 BY THE

86
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,359
SAME OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL,

87
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,528
DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAME TO THE

88
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:45,829
SAME CONCLUSION.

89
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,930
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFERED

90
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,931
LEGAL OPINIONS LIKE THAT ARE NOT

91
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:48,632
BINDING LAW.

92
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:50,800
THEY ARE BINDING ON THE

93
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,201
DEPARTMENT.

94
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:52,402
SINCE ROBERT MUELLER IS A

95
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:54,104
CREATURE OF THAT DEPARTMENT, NOT

96
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,305
AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, SPECIAL

97
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,606
COUNSEL WORKING FOR THE JUSTICE

98
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:58,041
DEPARTMENT, PRESUMABLY THOSE

99
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,510
OPINIONS WOULD BE BINDING UPON

100
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:00,777
HIM.

101
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:03,079
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IF THE

102
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,381
PRESIDENT WAS DETERMINED BY THE

103
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:06,316
SPECIAL COUNSEL 12 COMMITTED

104
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:10,587
SOME CRIME FOR WHICH HE COULD BE

105
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:11,922
IMPEACHED, HE COULD THEN BE

106
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:12,656
INDICTED.

107
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,724
IF HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE

108
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,993
OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE, ONCE HE IS

109
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:18,728
IMPEACHED, HE'S NOT IN OFFICE

110
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:21,031
AND THE OPINION DOESN'T APPLY.

111
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,566
HE COULD BE TRIED.

112
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,134
>> Shannon: THOSE ARE THE LEFT

113
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,802
RAISING THE CRY SAYING THAT HE'S

114
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:27,404
AN IMPERIALIST, HE'S GOING TO DO

115
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:28,805
EVERYTHING FOR HIMSELF AND

116
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,007
PARDON HIMSELF, THE CONSTITUTION

117
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:31,875
WIDELY PROVIDES HIM THAT.

118
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,677
>> THE ARGUMENT BEING MADE THAT

119
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:34,578
THE PRESIDENT IS DECLARING

120
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,613
HIMSELF ABOVE THE LAW.

121
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:37,547
IMPEACHMENT IS A CORE PART OF

122
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:38,415
THE LAW.

123
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:41,585
SO LONG AS HE IS VULNERABLE,

124
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,053
SUSCEPTIBLE, SUBJECT TO

125
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,421
IMPEACHMENT, HE'S NOT ABOVE THE

126
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:44,688
LAW.

127
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:47,057
>> Shannon: HE AND HIS

128
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,125
ATTORNEYS MAINTAIN IT'S A MOOT

129
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:49,492
QUESTION.

130
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:50,193
HE HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG AND

131
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:53,029
THEY ARE CONFIDENT THAT'S WHAT

132
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:53,797
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WILL FIND

133
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:55,165
GREAT >> I THINK IT'S THE SILLY

134
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:55,465
ISSUE.

135
00:03:55,465 --> 00:04:01,504
THE BIG IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

136
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:02,239
COULD BE CALAMITOUS POLITICALLY.

137
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,640
>> Shannon: I THINK IT WAS

138
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,642
THAT CHAIR OF THE SENATE

139
00:04:05,642 --> 00:00:00,000
JUDICIARY MITTIE CHUCK GRASSLEY
