plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time until Election Day but I</font>

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,650
lifetime I've never seen someone

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,109
attacked and slandered from every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,220
mean even even anticipating and even

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,750
predicting and even warning people this

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,600
is coming this is coming I sit back in

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,619
amazement and I notice that there isn't

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,050
a lot of playing of Trump speeches which

have been absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> magnificent I mean</font>

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,219
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few minor constructive</font>

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,250
criticisms for the candidate over over

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the last couple of months but you</font>

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,809
tune into TV and it's all just a

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">nonspecific slanders okay show me the</font>
