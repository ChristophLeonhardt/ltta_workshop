EXPERIENCE THAT JOHN McCAIN

65
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:07,990
HAD IN VIETNAM.

67
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:09,758
LONG TIME.

68
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,493

69
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:13,062
A WHILE.

70
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:15,031

71
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:16,832
THE END DECIDED IT WAS GOING TO

72
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,035
MAKE HIS FUNERAL PLANS AND MAKE

73
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,036
IT EXPLICIT THAT TRUMP WAS NOT

74
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:20,503
TO BE THERE?

75
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,371
>> YES IT DOES.

76
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,841
I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR ADVANCED

77
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,977
THIS CANCER IS, BUT I KNOW

78
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:28,711
THAT -- I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS

79
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,014
VERY AGGRESSIVE.

80
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:32,948
TO SAY THAT THINGS LIKE HE DID

81
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:38,254
ABOUT SARAH PALIN, LOOK, I WAS

82
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:38,621
WITH HIM.

83
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:40,556
I WARMED UP AN AUDIENCE FOR HIM

84
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:44,026
THE DAY AFTER THE CONVENTION IN

85
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:47,730
A BIG RALLY NORTH OF DETROIT AND

86
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,865
HE TRIED TO INTRODUCE ME TO

87
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,834
SARAH PALIN AND WE COULDN'T GET

88
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,636
NEAR HER BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST

89
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:54,136
MOBBED BY PEOPLE.

90
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:58,441
HE WAS THERE WHEN HE INTRODUCED

91
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,642
HER AND HE SAW THE ELECTRICITY.

92
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,477
I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT AFFECTED

93
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:01,744
US.

94
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:02,645
WE WERE UP IN THE BOOTH.

95
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:05,614
I TURNED TO MY LEFT AND I WAS

96
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:06,248
SITTING NEXT TO THE MOST

97
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:08,484
DECORATED AMERICAN WARRIOR AND

98
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,119
ALL OF HISTORY AND BUD HAD TEARS

99
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,519
IN HIS EYES.

100
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,822
HE WAS SO MOVED.

101
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:13,723
THAT'S THE EFFECT SHE HAD.

102
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:16,225
SO FOR HIM TO BE DOING THAT --

103
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,793
I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD ANYTHING

104
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:21,230
AGAINST JOHN FOR WHAT HE SAYS.

105
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,834
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT HAS

106
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:28,270
AFFECTED HIM, BUT THE JOHN THAT

107
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,605
I KNOW WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST

108
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,841
HEROES I EVER KNEW AND ONE OF

109
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:35,044
THE FINEST MEN I EVER KNEW.

110
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,045
>> Laura: FRANK, IT IS

111
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,413
INTERESTING TO GO BACK AND SEE

112
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:39,949
THOSE HEADLINES FROM ALL OF THE

113
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,584
ELITE PUBLICATIONS,

114
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,251
JOHN McCAIN THE SELLOUT,

115
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,185
JOHN McCAIN THE PHONY FRAUD,

116
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:44,186
ALL THE THINGS THEY SAID, BUT

117
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:47,189
NOW HE'S HITTING TRUMP AND HE

118
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,825
HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN AT ODDS WITH

119
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:51,761
TRUMP ON A NUMBER OF POLICIES,

120
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,862
IMMIGRATION, FOREIGN POLICY TO

121
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:56,799
NAME A FEW, AND NOW NOT JUST

122
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,269
BECAUSE I THINK HE'S OBVIOUSLY

123
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:00,970
SUFFERING TERRIBLY, I'VE LOST

124
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,639
THREE FRIENDS TO THIS IN THE

125
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,241
LAST THREE YEARS, IT'S A

126
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:05,841
HORRIFIC DISEASE.

127
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:06,542
YOU SEE THE EBB AND FLOW OF

128
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,878
THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

129
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,146
>> IT HAPPENED IN 2000 WHEN HE

130
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:12,047
WAS RUNNING AGAINST W.

131
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,883
IT HAPPENED IN 2008 WITH

132
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,951
MITT ROMNEY, SO THIS IS NOTHING

133
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:16,218
NEW.

134
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:17,086
JOHN McCAIN UNDERSTOOD HOW TO

135
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,821
USE THE PRESS TO HIS OWN

136
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,188
ADVANTAGE.

137
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:20,255
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE'S

138
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:20,856
SUCH A GOOD POLITICIAN.

139
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:23,259
BY THE WAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW

140
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,727
IT IS AN HONOR TO SIT NEXT TO

141
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:25,694
YOU AND FRANKLY I FEEL THE SAME

142
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:27,830
WAY ABOUT ANY OF THESE MEN.

143
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,599
THEY SUFFERED, TRULY SUFFERED IN

144
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,869
PRISONER OF WAR.

145
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:34,603
DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW WHO

146
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:36,005
YOU REMEMBER, I WAS ASKING

147
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,239
QUESTIONS IN

148
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,743
IOWA AND MY INTERVIEWER SAID

149
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:42,645
THAT JOHN McCAIN IS NOT A WAR

150
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:43,245
HERO.

151
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:45,414
HE WALKED THAT BACK WHEN YOU'RE

152
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,415
ON.

153
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,249
BUT McCAIN AND THE PRESS.

154
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:49,318
IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD

155
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:51,854
RELATIONSHIP.

156
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:55,224
>> Laura: THIS IS WHAT CNN

157
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:57,092
SAID TODAY, LET'S WATCH.

158
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:59,528
>> HE IS NOT A SELLOUT AND I

159
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,229
THINK HAVING PRESIDENT TRUMP,

160
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,630
JUST BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT

161
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,766
COME AND SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF OR

162
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,733
EULOGIZE HIM OR MEMORIALIZE HIM

163
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,203
WOULD BE SELLING OUT.

164
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:07,937
SENATOR MCCAIN, I SAY THIS NOT

165
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,306
JUST AS IT IS DAUGHTER'S PLAN,

166
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:13,576
BUT AS A REPUBLICAN WHO

167
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:16,178
SUPPORTED HIM, SENATOR MCCAIN IS

168
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:16,912
EVERYTHING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

169
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:18,981
IS NOT.

170
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:22,585
>> I HAVE TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY

171
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:24,720
SHOULD HAVE PULLED DONALD TRUMP

172
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,426
BEFORE HE SAID THAT ABOUT JOHN.

173
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:32,595
JOHN EJECTED AND HIS AIRPLANE

174
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:33,662
WAS JUST DISINTEGRATED.

175
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:34,530
ONE OF THE WINGS CAME OFF AND AS

176
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,468
SOON AS HIS CHUTE OPENED THE

177
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:40,703
WING SWUNG AROUND, BROKE BOTH OF

178
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:42,905
HIS ARMS AND ONE OF HIS LEGS, SO

179
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:47,042
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE WAS ABLE TO

180
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,445
OPEN UP -- MUCH LESS HOW HE

181
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:50,045
COULD SWIM.

182
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,681
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE SURVIVED

183
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,184
BUT I KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT

184
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:56,452
POSSIBLY HAVE DONE ANY

185
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:57,887
RESISTANCE BECAUSE HE WAS

186
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,022
HELPLESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER

187
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:00,856
THAT.

188
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,658
BUD DAY HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

189
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:04,126
BUD DAY HAD TO FEED HIM.

190
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:05,728
>> Laura: COULD YOU HEAR HIM

191
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:07,897
WHERE YOU WERE IN THE HEALTH AND

192
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:08,297
WHERE YOU WERE IN THE HEALTH AN

193
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:08,564
AND?

194
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:10,332
>> I LIVED WITH HIM FOR TWO

195
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:11,033
YEARS.

196
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,767
>> Laura: YOU ARE SEPARATED --

197
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:14,303
YOU WERE THERE FOR SIX YEARS AND

198
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:16,438
YOU ARE SEPARATED FOR A LONG

199
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:16,739
TIME.

200
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:21,877
>> IN '71 THERE WAS A BIG

201
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:22,578
UPRISING AMONGST US AND

202
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:26,048
JOHN McCAIN -- EVEN THOUGH BUD

203
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:27,483
DAY WAS THE SENIOR MANAGER,

204
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,183
JOHN McCAIN WAS CREDITED WITH

205
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:30,653
BEING THE LEADER OF THAT.

206
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:34,056
AND IN FACT, ON MARCH 19TH THEY

207
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,090
TOOK 36 OF US OUT, WE HONESTLY

208
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,693
THOUGHT WE WERE BEING TAKEN OUT

209
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:39,562
TO BE EXECUTED AND JOHN McCAIN

210
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:42,831
MADE A JOKE ABOUT IT.

211
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:47,403
A MAN WHO CAN VOLUNTEER TO DIE

212
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:48,103
FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, THAT'S

213
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:50,973
WHAT IT WAS AND MAKE A JOKE

214
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:54,043
ABOUT IT IS REALLY A TOP GUY.

215
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:57,446
I HOLD HIM ALMOST THE SAME

216
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:59,248
STATUS AS JAMES STOCKDALE.

217
00:06:59,248 --> 00:06:59,715
>> Laura: WOW.

218
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:02,685
TO JUST HEAR THE STORIES.

219
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:03,385
>> HE WOULDN'T GO HOME.

220
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,856
THEY SAID TO HIM GO HOME, BUT

221
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,858
BECAUSE -- IN TERMS OF BEING

222
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:10,626
CAPTURED, HE REFUSED AND SO THEY

223
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,661
BEAT HIM FOR IT.

224
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:13,429
THOSE THAT ARE CRITICAL OF HIM

225
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,130
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HOW HE

226
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,633
HAS VOTED ON CERTAIN ISSUES, WHO

227
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,034
AMONG US IN THIS STUDIO WOULD

228
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:20,569
GIVE OUR LEGS, ARMS, OUR BODY,

229
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,905
OUR LIVES?

230
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:24,673
>> Laura: HE ALSO SAID I THINK

231
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:25,941
AT ONE TIME, I WAS A P.O.W. BUT

232
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:30,212
WE CAN DISAGREE.

233
00:07:30,212 --> 00:00:00,000
JOHN KERRY SERVED HIS COUNTRY
