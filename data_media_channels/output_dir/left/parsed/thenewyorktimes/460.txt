Secrecy in government is not something
that came around this year.
We’ve seen secrecy grow across the years,
over several administrations of two different parties.
As tiring and as frustrating as it can be,
it’s become more essential for journalists to provide accountability and transparency
that we’re seeing less and less of in government.
