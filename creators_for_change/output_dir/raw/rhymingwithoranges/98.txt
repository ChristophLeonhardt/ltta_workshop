8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,250
was presented by Morgan Page loves whom

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,840
I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fan of on talk every week a new</font>

viewers are encouraged to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,910
that discussion through<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments and</font>

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,159
video responses and so I decided to

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,320
partake in the latter on her videarn

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,850
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> Morgan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed to come across as</font>

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,250
skeptical but optimistic about the

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,390
prospects of getting a tertiary

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,719
education she said that for certain

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,980
professions that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go into yes</font>

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,829
of course you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a university</font>

21
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,809
degree whether that be a doc being a

22
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,930
doctor lawyer or something vocational in

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,280
that sense but if you can do just as

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,260
well in your career without having to

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,960
get this degree that is going to put you

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">in an awful lot of debt especially from</font>

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,309
your from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United States what's the</font>

28
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,439
point just use the massive resource that

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,939
we have these days that is

30
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,979
revolutionising the way that we consume

31
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,020
media and teach yourself on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,740
why not so I am lucky enough to have

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,140
gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the university system in</font>

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,570
the UK I spent five years studying

35
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,250
languages while you see and I walk we

done when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were alive espanol tambien</font>

37
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,860
now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,520
gotten to the level of proficiency in my

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,799
chosen field which is languages had I

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
not gone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> university yes it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,509
been possible for me to just up sticks

42
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,159
and move to China which to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair is</font>

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,930
what I did as part of my course for a

44
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,299
couple years but the university

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,780
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> system taught me an awful lot</font>

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,600
in terms of how to function as a human

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,130
being and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> it taught me about my</font>

be an hour can prick most of the time

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,170
traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> educational institutions</font>

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,009
often get a bad rap on youtube and there

52
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,720
are sometimes described by some users as

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,340
institutions that are steeped in too

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,930
much tradition and not enough innovation

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,890
that they start will create

56
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,990
tivity and aren't adapting well enough

things that I learned in my time at

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,270
University were stuff that included not

69
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,400
just learning languages which are

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">blooming loved but also the ability to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">go on study abroad schemes to I had a</font>

able to partake in these new media

projects that I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been able</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to do otherwise um I also learn how to</font>

it or not only a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> lepage made not</font>

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,959
on her talk video but on her personal

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,090
channel which was kind of a follow-up to

83
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the discussion she said that she really</font>

learning and the love of<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquiring</font>

88
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,769
knowledge now I fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that camp I I</font>

89
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,530
didn't go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> university with the thought</font>

90
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,209
of furthering my career and this is

91
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,400
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has come up in the UK</font>

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,500
recently because of the fact that

93
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,540
tuition fees have recently gone up by

94
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,950
three hundred percent we are now

95
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,000
encouraged to look at a university

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,049
degree not as us learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for learnings</font>

97
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,549
sake and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> love of knowledge and</font>

98
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,440
not because we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

99
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,480
and maybe become experts in our field

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
we're expected to go to university in

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,150
the UK now because it furthers our drug

102
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,980
prospects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as an investment in our</font>

103
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,048
future as more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more information</font>

104
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,880
becomes available online through stuff

105
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,380
like Google Scholar through stuff like

106
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,430
Wikipedia and the Internet in general we

107
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,550
aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need to go to</font>

108
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,630
universities

109
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,770
in order for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to learn for learnings</font>

110
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,960
sake people who love learning are going

111
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,310
to be able to learn the stuff that they

112
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,170
learn online and universities I am

113
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,480
worried that universities if we go down

114
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,240
a more fine like a more financial and

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,400
profit-making route where they aren't

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,080
supported by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government and by</font>

117
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,310
general taxes that we are going to have

118
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,200
universities that aren't hubs of

119
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,210
knowledge and of creativity and of

120
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,840
research but are simply training grounds

121
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,450
for vocational degrees and people who

122
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,370
are wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to further to careers I'm</font>

123
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,750
sorry if this video has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been slightly</font>

124
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,550
rambling without point but I haven't

125
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,410
scripted this and I literally just sat

126
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,050
down outside with a cup of tea and

127
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,880
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chat with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

128
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,360
which I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in a while and you</font>

129
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,920

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,210
like to bounce this over to you guys

131

132
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,990
discussions about these kinds of things

133

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,650
the implications of a more profit driven
