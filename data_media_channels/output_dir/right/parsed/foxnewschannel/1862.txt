CHEATING.
OF COURSE, WE ARE ALL SURE
THEY'RE NOT CHEATING JUST IN
CASE.
>> Harris: JUST IN CASE.
TOM DUPREE?
>> Tom: I THINK THE PRESIDENT
IS VERY COMFORTABLE WHERE HE IS
RIGHT NOW.
KEEP IN MIND, HIS BACKGROUND IS
AS A NEGOTIATOR AND THIS IS THE
BIGGEST NEGOTIATION ON THE
BIGGEST STAGE WE'VE SEEN.
THE FACT IS THE PRESIDENT'S
POSITIONING THIS FOR A SITUATION
IN WHICH HE CAN NEGOTIATE
AGGRESSIVELY CREATIVELY AND
UNPREDICTABLY.
I THINK THAT HE IS DOING A VERY
SMART THING RIGHT NOW AND
SENDING THESE PUBLIC SIGNALS
BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO
IS THEY ARE GOING TO CONDITION
THE NEGOTIATING LANDSCAPE FROM
WHEN HE FINALLY SITS DOWN WITH
NORTH KOREA.
>> Harris: REAL QUICKLY BEFORE
WE OPEN IT WIDER TO THE COUCH,
YOU WORKED FOR PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION OF MY
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AND I'M
CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
OF WHERE THIS PRESIDENT IS
TAKING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

A SCHISM IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
BETWEEN THE TRUMP FACTION AND
THEY NEVER TRUMP ONCE THE
PRESIDENT HAS LEFT OFFICE,
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.
>> Harris: 'S OTHER HANDING
SOME CANDY OVER TO THE
REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW.
THERE POPULATE POPULARITY, THEIR
EDGE HAS SLID.
>> Trish: AND NOT DOING THEM
ANY FAVORS.
TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AGAIN,
NANCY PELOSI ONCE AGAIN TALKING
ABOUT TAXES GOING UP AND THE
TRUTH IS FOR THE BLUE-COLLAR
DEMOCRATS, HE WAS ABLE TO BRING
IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA COME
HE'S GOT A REAL SHOT AT BRINGING
THEM INTO CONSISTENTLY.
THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY ITSELF DOES NOT
FULLY EMBRACE AS PRESIDENT.
SO DID THEY START TO MOVE OVER
TO THE ELITE GROUP OF THE LEFT?
THAT'S WHAT I FIND FASCINATING
HERE AND I THINK IT HAS THE
