today's the day that we see a solar
eclipse we're on the ship
and they gave us these glasses see it
thank you
I can't see anything and I figured if I
just look out into the Sun I'm not
trusting these sunglasses to help us see
the Eclipse
I don't can't really mombi have you
tried these yet they're slick but yeah
you can't see anything they're
completely dark I guess they just want
to make sure that you don't go blind see
how they work
I'll just read them like this okay we
are ready because our friends hooked us
up with the best seats in the house mama
B what do you think okay scientifically
they set up direct access to the Sun so
the Sun is going to be coming over here
it's gonna be right around there
somewhere and then we're gonna wear
these things and then you can like put
them on and then you guys could see the
Sun you wear these right now
you could like stare directly into the
Sun and that's basically what's gonna
happen I'm gonna actually hook up the
camera to this thing so you guys can
actually see it what it happens what's
the play-by-play what do you see I see
that the Sun is partially
okay probably about one eight seven does
it look like the fight has been taken
out of the Sun yes how's it going
monkeys this is crazy
yeah it looks like a like a pac-man see
it's still like a round circle she's
totally into it baby what do you see
baby what do you see
you see is that crazy is like pac-man
funky are you enjoying the total eclipse
of the heart you are no don't look at
what the Sun don't look talked to you
that you'll be blind
get your glasses boy okay what's the
scoop chichi what's the scoop what do we
got okay the sun's over there it's
covering most of the Sun but not all not
all it's like three quarters you can't
see it on the camera
it doesn't work right if you put with
the filter on it but still it doesn't
look like that it's kind of a ripoff I
was expecting it to be much darker now
you can really see the moon covering it
it is like almost covering it's a little
is covering it I think it's gonna go
dark very soon
and you see my fingers no so can you see
me picking your nose hey hey hey can you
see me kiss your face
I think everybody has that problem today
gosh well just do it like the what the
people used to do it in the 50s with our
own eyes now we're gonna try one more
time with my homeboy Cory okay so I'm
aiming it right now let's see if he can
oh yes yes I think I got it yes I think
I can see it guys I think we got it
success
there it is guys eclipse from our eyes
to you that was the best way to do it
sweet
and there's a total eclipse of the heart
that's amazing
what else do you want the fatty divan
love repeatable la Vida Rosa
totally puts the heart baby and you have
all the ice cream you could eat he's
like I'm just gonna put these glasses on
my forehead I'm just gonna eat all the
ice cream I can while my parents are
distracted looking at the Sun so we're
in the middle of the Caribbean right now
and to see the total eclipse you have to
be in the middle of the US somewhere in
certain parts so that was the best we
could capture but it was still great
without a total eclipse but it was what
partial more than partial yeah are like
a partial eclipse of the heart you think
you can do that
day two it's kind of dabble you sir how
about you try not to break break a limb
while you surface at a dabbing you just
balance
