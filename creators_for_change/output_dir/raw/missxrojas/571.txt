00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,650
hood yeah I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a</font>

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,660
slightly more serious topic now aged

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,389
Bundy debate which is going on in the UK

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,950
right now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">are aware of it it's like that you know</font>

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much affects the book trade and</font>

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,100
like anyone really<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in a book</font>

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,359
trade in any way that's authors

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,750
publishers booksellers etc but it's a

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,080
big thing the UK publishers quite a lot

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what they</font>

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,619
want to do is take books any book the

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,989
web would sell to children put a sticker

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,140
on it saying the designated age so it

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,210
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a book for sale like six plus</font>

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,660
i had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> circle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a eight plus of my +</font>

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,510

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Richard and Judy books I am very</font>

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,620
unhappy about it and for a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,960
reasons first off on us<font color="#E5E5E5"> out said in it</font>

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,199
there are some amazing books in like

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,329
junior fiction that I still read which

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,600
books you know go in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 to 12 section</font>

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,670
books which I would happily recommend to

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,739
a nine or 18 year old and I would read

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,330
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I loved him I still love them</font>

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,299
but when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten when I was 12 or even</font>

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,640
when I was 13 I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't read a book if</font>

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,010
it's at seven loss on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it why would I do</font>

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,140
that do you want to read things that

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,960
push you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel advanced but</font>

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,580
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in different ways you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,049
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find enjoyment from different</font>

35
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,330
sources and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids are going to stop</font>

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading if they see they're gonna stop</font>

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
reading books that they enjoy if they

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,310
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got a sudden plastic on it</font>

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,689
cuz they're gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

40
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be like know what it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,570
read this it's too childish for me it's

42
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely ridiculous furthermore the</font>

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,200
biggest point that I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make is</font>

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,329
that they're doing this for the

45
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,420
supermarket culture where supermarkets

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,829
who have lots of money are trying to

47
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,829
squeeze in every possible shop into one

48
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,540
big supermarket I mean see Tesco Extra

49
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,829
see any Sainsbury's see I which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

50
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but like big as de as well I</font>

51
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,810
mean we saw happened with harry porter

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,180
when they try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

53
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,800
paying the problem money and blue

54
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,780
like Mitch please you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,030
pay but mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> supermarkets and</font>

56
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Woolworths and so on I tried to sell</font>

57
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,600
books at cheap funding prices and people

58
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
want this but obviously there's so much

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,950
demand for them you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know book so cheap</font>

60
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,450
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of putting the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aged man</font>

61
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,920
Yvonne is so that people can go to the

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,070
bookshop say that's book is it suitable

63
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,310
for a trip oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the right sticker</font>

64
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,230
you know if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what age</font>

65
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,690
group you book your reading is for if

66
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,590
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether it's suitable</font>

67
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,780
for your kid or your brother or yourself

68
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,450
go into a bookstore with people who

69
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,040
actually read books know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,020
talking about just ask anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font>

71
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advice is gonna be so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

72
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,490
better I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say this just a walk</font>

73
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,410
in a bookshop I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sick this is</font>

74
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,070
ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's this is gonna drive out</font>

75
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,480
independent booksellers which already

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,030
you know pretty scarce as it is let

77
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,830
alone children's independent booksellers

78
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,830
and furthermore this is even going to be

79
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,470
worse full no<font color="#E5E5E5"> boosters and so on who are</font>

80
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna have to compete with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

81
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,470
supermarket and is awful so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors</font>

82
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,150
it's awful because it's cutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

83
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,700
readerships and it's insulting to them

84
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,700
because another thing that pissed me off

85
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,100
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the authors won't</font>

86
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,290
even notified in advance they found it

87
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a general press you know at least</font>

88
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,810
tell the authors that this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

89
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,630
happen and there's a furious man I know

90
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,360
Philip Pullman's angry and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big group</font>

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,880
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> waters have started up this and this</font>

92
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">website where anyone can sign it</font>

93
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,660
basically an equal sign is sort

94
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,070
petitions to say look this isn't

95
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,440
acceptable we're not happy with this so

96
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,239
on Emily even my<font color="#CCCCCC"> manager she gets like</font>

97
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,470
all these notifications and these

98
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,640
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the meetings that they</font>

99
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,170
attempt i think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's over</font>

100
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">2,000 strong people must've names have</font>

101
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,400
signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you name or the famous officer</font>

102
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean j Rowling herself a signed out</font>

103
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,600
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> matters so much guys I can't</font>

104
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,590
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's appalling I mean I know</font>

105
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,350
it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be helpful immediately to a</font>

106
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,959
parent who's like crap what do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get my</font>

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,300
charger<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd the best thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to</font>

108
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,370
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a bookseller and talk about what</font>

109
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,080
the child is ready to enjoyed with them

110
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,150
and find a book that is suitable for

111
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,470
their reading ability because if you

112
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go with this generic 7 plus</font>

113
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,480
8 plus idea then

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
they can get books that they hate they

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,440
got to get books they get special

116
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,540
promotions just for the sake of the

117
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">publisher trying to promote their book</font>

118
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,860
rather than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know rather than a book</font>

119
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,540
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually generally good that's</font>

120
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,370
what's going to happen like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

121
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">go by bestsellers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from supermarkets and</font>

122
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,860
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a sickening it's good</font>

123
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible it's gonna be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,449
atrocious coach book salads ask them for

125

advice but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I know you got a certain</font>

126
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,310
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expertise or no independent</font>

127
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,570
bookseller that you don't get in the

128
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,770
bigger chains but even than being a

129
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,139
change moremore or hiring specialists

130
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,520
like children's book<font color="#CCCCCC"> specialists that is</font>

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,020
like that to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because they know</font>

132
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is why people come to book</font>

133
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,699
shops out because I need to advise that

134
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,590
there macking in supermarkets where

135
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,850
someone will tell you you know where the

136
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,770
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> harry potter is the same with in a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">time where the cheeses it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

138
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,289
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not right and it makes</font>

139
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,539
me really really angry other people will

140
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,820
say yeah I get what you're saying

141
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,410
resented but aren't you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for young</font>

142
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,039
adult books and you know isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font>

143
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,450
of hypocritical if you're ready in two

144
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,950
young adult books and you're saying that

145
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not enough of a young adult</font>

146
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,669
market because truly a harlot market is

147
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,150
as a as someone put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an article</font>

148
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,810
while gay surely a younger market is

149
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,060
isolating else and saying you can't read

150
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,669
everything in the adult market but no

151
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,380
there should not wanted to do the other

152
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,789
market meet I sure to give this the Arab

153
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:47,450
