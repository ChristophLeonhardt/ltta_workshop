1
00:00:00,525 --> 00:00:01,759
DENUCLEARIZATION, ALL THE

2
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:03,161
MURDERS AND STUFF, NOT SO MUCH.

3
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:05,830
THE PRESIDENT SAID WE'LL BE

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,865
DOING SOMETHING ON IT BUT HE

5
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:11,135
DIDN'T ELABORATE.

6
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:16,908
GENE CUMMINGS IS WITH US.

7
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:18,643
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE PLIGHT

8
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,011
OF HIS PEOPLE?

9
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:23,248
>> WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT

10
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:24,482
BECAUSE --

11
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,618
>> Shep: WAS OUR DESCRIPTION

12
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:27,685
GENERALLY SPEAKING ACCURATE?

13
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:29,087
>> FROM WHAT WE KNOW.

14
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:32,156
WE KNOW FROM DEFECTORS WHAT THE

15
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,191
CONDITIONS ARE OVER THERE.

16
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,927
THE NUMBER OF DEFECTORS IN THE

17
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:38,997
PAST YEAR GIVEN THE NEW

18
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,799
RESTRICTIONS ON IMMIGRATION AND

19
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,800
MIGRATION, THAT THE TRUMP

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,402
ADMINISTRATION HAS IMPOSED, THE

21
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,437
NUMBER OF RECENT DEFECTORS IS

22
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:49,907
DOWN TO TWO, LITERALLY TWO.

23
00:00:49,907 --> 00:00:50,875
>> Shep: TWO PEOPLE.

24
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,878
>> TWO PEOPLE HAVE GAINED ACCESS

25
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:55,780
TO THE UNITED STATES.

26
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,181
THE NUMBERS ARE ALWAYS LOW.

27
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,082
REGARD LOW.

28
00:00:58,082 --> 00:00:59,550
BUT THOSE DEFECTORS THAT HAVE

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,720
COME IN HAVE DESCRIBED THE VERY

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,324
KINDS OF CONDITIONS THAT YOUR

31
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:07,458
TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT YOU

32
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,160
DESCRIBED WAS IN A UNITED

33
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,331
NATIONS REPORT IN RECENT YEARS.

34
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,565
YES, THOSE ARE THE CONDITIONS

35
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:16,267
THAT PEOPLE ARE ENDURING OVER

36
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:16,601
THERE.

37
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,336
THAT'S WHY SO MANY HUMAN RIGHTS

38
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,538
ADVOCATES WANTED FOR THE

39
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,141
PRESIDENT TO PUT THAT ISSUE ON

40
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:26,678
THE TABLE IN A MORE ANIMATED WAY

41
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:28,980
THAN IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN.

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,116
>> Shep: YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A

43
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:36,120
RHETORICAL CARROT AND STICK

44
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,554
ACTION HERE.

45
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,388
>> YES.

46
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,657
ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THE

47
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:43,294
PRESIDENT, HE HAS A TENDENCY TO

48
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:48,032
SOFTEN UP HIS TARGET WITH TOUGH

49
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,233
RHETORIC AND THEN BRING THE

50
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,436
PERSON TO THE TABLE WITH

51
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:51,836
COMPLIMENTS.

52
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:53,004
IT'S CARROTS AND STICKS.

53
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:54,539
HE DID IT WITH MEXICO WHERE HE

54
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,507
WAS VERY HARD ON THEM AND THEN

55
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:58,009
TRIED TO BRING THEM INTO THE

56
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,310
NAFTA NEGOTIATIONS.

57
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,478
DIDN'T WORK THEN.

58
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:02,347
WE'LL SEE IF THIS WORKS NOW.

59
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:04,215
>> Shep: THIS JUXTAPOSITION OF

60
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:06,117
THE BEATING UP OF OUR FRIENDS

61
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:10,655
AND THE HUGGING OF OUR ENEMIES

62
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,557
PHYSICALLY IS STRIKING AND FEELS

63
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:12,957
HISTORICAL.

64
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:16,127
I WONDER WHAT THE LENS OF

65
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,196
HISTORY WILL DO TO IT ALL.

66
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:22,133
>> ALL OF THIS WILL BE JUDGED BY

67
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:22,467
HISTORY.

68
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,735
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO KNOW

69
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:24,969
AT THE END OF THE TRUMP

70
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:26,404
ADMINISTRATION WHAT KIND OF

71
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:29,140
GRADE HE WILL GET IN THE HISTORY

72
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,574
BOOKS.

73
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:32,744
MUCH WILL DEPEND ON HOW NORTH

74
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:35,880
KOREA EVOLVES AFTER THESE TALKS,

75
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,548
AFTER ANY KIND OF AGREEMENT.

76
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,984
YOU KNOW, THE SAME IS TRUE OF

77
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:40,985
THE IRAQ WAR.

78
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:42,987
WE CAN'T REALLY MEASURE IT UNTIL

79
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:44,722
WE SEE WHAT BECOMES OF IRAQ.

80
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:47,725
THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE HERE.

81
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:49,460
IT DOES FEEL HISTORIC.

82
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,929
IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN

83
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:53,464
WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES.

84
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,032
MAYBE A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS

85
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:57,068
WHAT WAS NEEDED.

86
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:59,270
CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT

87
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,872
PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE ABOUT CUBA.

88
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:03,641
WE'VE DONE IT ONE WAY FOR 30

89
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,175
YEARS.

90
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:05,543
WHY NOT TRY SOMETHING.

91
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,278
>> Shep: OF COURSE BEN RHODES

92
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:10,982
WENT IN TO TALK TO CASTRO'S NEXT

93
00:03:10,982 --> 00:00:00,000
OF KIN 20 TIMES BEFORE PRESIDENT
