00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,624
[music]

2
00:00:00,624 --> 00:00:01,734
[sniffing]

3
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:06,840
There are noses and
then, there are noses.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,190
And for sense of smell, the
biggest is one of the best.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,620
Elephants use their noses
for lots of things —

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,530
finding mates, identifying
family members, and probably

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,080
most important, finding food.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,040
They’re good.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,620
They can find food
very far away.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,230
But how good?

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,170
To find out, researchers
set up two experiments.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,640
To test smell at close
range, they used two buckets.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,220
One had a plant that elephants
enjoy and the other, a plant

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,450
that smelled similar, but
that elephants don’t like.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,000
The elephants easily detected
the subtle differences

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,030
between the two
plants by smell alone.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,310
Then the researchers tried
the same kind of test

18
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,810
on a larger scale.

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,450
They built an outdoor
elephant-size version

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,480
of the classic Y maze.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,670
Think laboratory mice
sniffing for cheese.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,500
This was a more
difficult problem.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,940
Sniff out the
subtle difference

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,210
between two similar
plants at a distance —

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,220
no problem for the elephants.

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
Now, it may seem obvious
that elephants can sniff out

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,110
the foods that they
like, but the differences

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,310
between these plants
are very subtle,

29
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,989
and the plants are far away.

30
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,420
“We can smell
when our neighbor

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,510
puts on the steak on the
barbecue next door.

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,090
They’re doing this throughout
their entire environment,

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,298
across multiple spatial
scales, for things that

34
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:24,270
don’t smell very strongly.”

35
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,900
It turns out elephants are
actually smell champions.

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,910
Like other mammals,
including humans,

37
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,860
they have scent
receptors that register

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,050
molecules in air they inhale.

39
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,910
The brain’s olfactory
bulb picks up

40
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,920
signals from those receptors.

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,230
Elephants have more
scent receptors

42
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,530
and a bigger olfactory
bulb than any other mammal.

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,410
And there’s that trunk, which
serves as a movable smell

44
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,630
antenna, which can go under
a log or into the wind.

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,690
Their noses are so good
that they help them

46
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,180
avoid minefields in Angola.

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,720
In fact, tests showed
that they can detect TNT.

48
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,950
[bell ringing]

49
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,950
And one study showed that
the elephants could use scent

50
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,758
clues alone to detect the
difference between two Kenyan

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,690
tribes: the Maasai, who
traditionally speared them,

52
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,210
and the Kamba, who didn’t.

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,590
Bomb detector, human
sorter, food finder —

54
00:02:19,590 --> 00:00:00,000
that’s quite a nose.
