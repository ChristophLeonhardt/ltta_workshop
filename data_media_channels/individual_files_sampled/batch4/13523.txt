now we talk about history a lot on the show you know that so consider this a mini this day in history segment because the archivists at the daily wire have dug up incredible footage showing what women used to look like before feminism let's see it I'm sorry I didn't mean to fight me but you don't know what I've been through and all because I was afraid I'm so ashamed chirp-chirp sure that was so nice that was like watching a cartoon sweet little ELISA so we don't Lisa is very fair-skinned it was just like what a beautiful and now also I'm sorry you had to come out of it now let's take a look at what feminism has turned women into it doesn't stand for women's rights I get my camera out of my face see what I am the feminist who is out to ruin your I am the feminist who is ruining your perfectly respectful marriage by suggesting Audrey Lorde to the book club that your wife attends and yes I am the one who convinced her to get that shorter haircut that you pretend to like but don't really like I am the feminist who is pushing your daughter down the slippery slope of slut hood but giving her a high five when she says she keeps her own supply of condoms and incidentally I've tried to turn her bisexual gay by recommending some dental dams yes that's progress there it is there's the progress everybody what an advancement how enlightened now we are what wonderful things feminism has brought to the world we have to bring on now faith more a wonderful writer about all things feminist and more importantly a Disney Princess addict faith thank you for coming on hi thanks for having me it's great to be here so faith my first question which is more of a fantasy Disney or feminism feminism no feminism is based on a lie it's based on the lie that men and women are the same that gender is a social contract that's a lie Disney tells the truth about women and what's so strange about it too is that is the central lie men and women are the same they're indistinguishable and yet it's called feminism they always say well it just means men and women they deserve the same rights or whatever but then why is it called feminism it's that we have a philosophy for that which is called egalitarianism so it seems on the one hand it says men and women are exactly the same and on the other hand women are this totally separate categorical entity and we need to give them everything and them yell at us and kick our signs down well not only that it also ends up saying that men are actually better than women because if you say that gender is a social construct and men and women are exactly the same but everything that is feminine is because of the oppression of men so women have to act more like men that means men are better than women everything within the category of woman is a lesser and worse and terrible right given that given and it's funny because given the premise if men and women really are no different then there are no women right then there isn't a categorical distinction between men and women it's just it's just men and men with long hair who look nicer now faith you love Disney Princesses you have a pretty big Facebook page about this you'll write about this frequently why do you love them so I love Disney Princesses well all girls love Disney Princesses I mean little girls love Disney Princess that's the most controversial statement that has ever been uttered on my program yeah I'm here too you just really shake things up with my Disney princess conversation no I mean it doesn't matter how much feminists try to convince us that little girls don't love princesses they do they love princesses and the thing about Disney Princesses is that they're actually a great they're great role models for modern girls because they're they're brave and passionate and outspoken and they have goals and they follow their dreams and all these things but they do it without compromising their femininity their kindness their nurturing nature they want love they want to start a family all of these things but somewhere along the line feminists got a hold of the narrative about Disney Princesses and they did to the princesses what they do to women which is that because they act like women they've decided that they're just these victim damsels in distress' husband hunters and we believe them so the the pub the general public sort of believes them so anyone who tells you that they love Disney Princesses apologizes first they say like I know I know they're really sorry I'm sorry but I just really love them you know and moms like they banned them from their houses and they're not allowed to like I'm allowed to watch some of these things but but really I think in our current culture in our current situation situation about gender these are some really great stories for little girls to be looking at to figure out how to become women and you make the point on damsels in distress that's that's how a lot of people think of them that's how to portrayed that they're just waiting for the man to come around but you say they're not damsels in distress just like women before feminism weren't just helpless damsels in distress what do these people get wrong so I mean you just play that whole thing about Snow White and in fact in that clip that you played she says I'm so what did she say I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made and so when you think about that right this is a person who I mean in that scene she's just been like someone threatened to kill her essentially and then she ran away and she can never come home so that's bad and but she's so ashamed of the fuss that she's made right and the next thing that she does is she goes to a house find that it would be a really good place to hide out and decides to make a deal with the people who live there she is gonna cook and clean for them because she knows how to do that and they'll let her stay so I mean if if feminists want her to be a freeloader and just get the men in the house to take care of her then that would be fine I guess but really what she does is she actually shows up with a plan that's right she's not just offering her body or something she says I have these skills and I'm gonna make a deal and strike out on my own and not have to become some fake man in order to do it exactly and I think they're they're almost all like that until you get to the princesses that are the more recent ones that are supposed to be more modern and then you get these princesses who are sort of like infantilized and objectified like in their own story except those are the ones because they write shoot and that's the new fiction that they're it were it's not that we're seeing this throughout all of these Disney movies and more largely throughout all of the folk tales and fables that come to us through the tradition we're actually this is a modern advancement that the women are oppressed that they're this is an ideological vision that's being imposed even on these stories even on these Disney stories how long until we see a transgendered Disney Princess oh it's it's coming development right now yeah I think so I mean we had the first boy princess but it was it was in a cartoon on television so I said it doesn't officially count but yeah I mean there was a boy who was dressing up as a girl in order to do something or other and you know so he was sort of lauded as Disney's first boy princess oh my gosh I actually don't follow the you'll be shocked to hear this I don't follow Disney very closely I didn't so that they're already testing into what will become inevitably the transgender Disney Princess also known as the end of Disney Princesses right exactly yeah I mean I think that's probably that's really gonna happen I mean there's already called for Elsa from frozen to be a lesbian since you know she didn't have a love interest and all of this stuff so I mean all of that all of that is coming and I think you're just gonna lose the girls you know this is what this is what happens in the culture generally they loot they insist on adding this ideological vision and then they lose their audience because it's no longer entertaining it no longer corresponds to reality as we know reality is we as we as we see ourselves and as we see other people in the world and they lose all the audience but they still win all of the awards because it's so important man isn't it so important and powerful right exactly you know and now we're essentially telling you know my least favorite Disney movie of all Disney princess movie of all time is brave and brave is a story about not growing up because they can't they they can't have her find a husband that I can't have her you know have her life they had basically she goes out on the whole quest that a Disney Princess goes out on and then ends up right back home where she started and we have no idea what's gonna happen to her so that's that's essentially what's happening is they're infantilizing women by making it so that they can't they can't leave home because there's nothing for them out there that's right you knew you know there there is Peter Pan but Peter Pan is a sad tale it's a sad thing that Peter can't grow up and doesn't move on with his life and I think this is sort of a right exactly I think this is kind of a rationalist this is what happens with ideologies ideology forgets that we live in time and we live in space and so they say this is it this is the frozen moment but I don't know I really liked college college was a lot of fun I don't wish that I were still in college because that's in the past I like other you know Ivy was fun to be a child but I don't wish that I were still a child and they lose that and and all conservatives I like to think look at reality as it is and they understand that we live in time we live in a space and you can't stay and never Neverland forever Lefty's tell us they tell us all the time that gender is a social construct but I'm looking at you faith you look very much like a lady you seem objectively prettier than I am your voice is higher pitched than mine is is there evidence that gender is a social construct no in fact I think there's evidence that it is not a social construct that it is inherent in men to be men and women to be women and there are even there are studies that sort of you know the most recent one I saw was about sort of toy preference and they kind of they've they weeded out all of these things like you know whether the mom and dad were there and all this stuff and it was like the girls picked the girl toys the boy I mean no it's ridiculous you know I and I think that when when you try to prove that that gender is a social construct you you end up just sort of talking yourself in circles and when the feminists do it they end up talking themselves into victimhood essentially no of course they it always ironically something that's supposed to empower them ends up making them like little children and I love that you brought up the scientific studies because I've seen these two studies that show that regardless of socialization regardless of the awful patriarchal culture boys want to play with boy toys and robot girls won't play with girl toys and then in fake studies in like gender studies one of my hobbies a few years ago a buddy of mine did and I we did we did this on tumblr we created a blog called Gender Studies department ID as always I think it's still up there Gender Studies department - blog tumblr com and we would just post quotes from actual peer-reviewed published Gender Studies papers that absolutely meant nothing they were just random words and so one quote says and this is by this might be the most rational quote of all of them it says at the root of eco feminism is the understanding that the many systems of oppression are mutually reinforcing building on the socialist feminist insight that racism classism and sexism are interconnected eco feminists whatever that is recognized additional similarities between those forms of human oppression and the oppressive structures of speciesism and naturism and ism ISM and ISM ISM ISM I notice all of these other lefty ideas socialism environmentalism they keep creeping into discussions about feminism can there be a conservative feminism I sometimes hear some of my conservative or my conservative ish female friends say things like you know a woman with a gun that yeah with a gun that's real feminism or a woman CEO raising children and go and work every day that's feminism or whatever they say is there a conservative feminism or are isms and ideologies like feminism just incompatible with with conservative thought well I think that at the heart of feminism or I guess at the beginning of feminism I think it began with a notion that we can all agree with which is that men and women are equally valuable to society that that you need men and women and that you know women should be allowed to do the same kinds of things as men if they want to do them and I think and so I think that if that were still true about feminism then maybe we could get behind it more than then we can now but that that isn't actually what the feminists now are saying you know they're not they're not saying it's that men and women are equally valuable to size to society they're saying that they're the same and that certain traits be they male or female are positive or negative I mean the thing is men have inherently male traits and women have inherently female traits and there's no moral judgement about that it just is mm-hmm so when you start to put moral judgment on the inherent traits that's when you get lost and I think that feminism has gotten lost so I don't I don't know what the word would be for someone who thinks rationally but Christian you know there are some other versions too rational people yeah I don't know you know that's absolutely right there's a the complementarity of the sexes poses equal value in Christianity and and Judaism the eve is plucked out of Adam's rib not out of his head she's not higher than Adam out of his foot she's not lower than a time right out of his rib in the beginning God created man both male and female he created them they've equal dignity but they're clearly not the same I hope they're not the same the blogger speaking speaking of the complementarity of the sexes we're gonna get a little saucy here the bloggers Samara over at scary mommy wrote a piece called sometimes I want to be held by a man naked without having sex is that okay the answer is no by the way she says that women need intimacy in their lives and therefore they should be able to expect it from randos that they hook up with what is wrong with that can't women have it all no actually women can't have it all even when they say when they're referring to the other thing which is like working and raising kids they can't have it all in that area either but um no that is a ridiculous request because and the reason it's a ridiculous request is because you don't actually know that person and therefore you can't have intimacy with him you can have an intimate act but you can't have interesting yet intimate as in like get it on as in like you know whatever you want to call that but you can't have intimacy with that person because you just met them like an hour ago and you know now you're upstairs in their apartment naked and and I think you know like if if you get naked in front of someone that you just met um I think you're basically sending the message that you would like to have sex like you're not really sending the message that you'd like to just kind of lie there and I don't always the message I'm trying to send I don't know if people are misinterpreting what I'm that's the message you know one time I went on a date with his ease I'm sorry and he and I he and I just had clicked well I'll save it for another time but we just had very different views of what was happening you know well if you'd like to tell me I can publish it and then I'll keep your name and good keep it anonymous I not a lot of people watch the show so I don't think it'll really get out you know yes that is that is so right there there is because you you wrote beautifully on this topic about how women do long for these things in a way that men don't oh I don't want to tell any tales at a school here folks but it turns out that men are more comfortable with casual sex and desire it more than women do broadly speaking no new you think that me too speaking of is awful me too some center-right writers have jumped on board though they say yes these awful men they've harassed me too what is wrong with this slacktivism me too has sort of devolved into this I mean I said something really interesting I think is happening about me too which is that you know initially it arose I guess because of all of the really horrible things that were going on like Harvey Weinstein and all of those other people and and people were saying you know I was really really truly violated and but it was very very quickly devolved into yes you know me too because somebody can't called me on the street or you know me too because I saw a man one time or me to just give Michael nose looks you just kind of laid out an Italian you got a gold chain it doesn't like that guy on the subway looked like he was going to ask for my number and did it me too so you know it's kind of that really deal Ajith amaizing the victims of actual sexual crimes right like lumping all of those things together is really a terrible thing to do to people that have actually experienced something horrific but especially these days there great currency in victimhood this whole my mother was more floors for less money thing and so you see rape hoaxes you see a spike in rape hoaxes on campus both before college and and obviously on college campuses we've had major uh the the the vast majority if not all of the major headline-grabbing rape cases at universities in the last five years have come out to be hoaxes beginning with Duke Lacrosse but all the way up to the UVA scandal that Rolling Stone breathlessly reported on without any evidence there's a lot of currency in that in that victimhood it seems to say something about the culture that we're so proud to be victims it seems that something is unhealthy in the culture yeah absolutely and I think I think that it's all sort of a product of this you know we're we're so oppressed you know gender social constructs kind of mentality because if women are supposed to behave like men when it comes to sex and they're supposed to want to have the kinds of meaningless sex and you know like swipe in whatever direction on tinder they're supposed to be swiping you know then then it's always the fault of the man if they feel violated right where they feel uncomfortable in some way because that wasn't actually what they wanted to do what they wanted to do was meet a nice guy and fall in love and you know get married children so you know then but it allows you to maintain the lie by saying that you're the victim you were victimized something went wrong this isn't normally how this progresses this regret is so this is how I'm supposed to behave I'm supposed to want this but you know so you did something wrong and I'm the victim and now we can maintain the lie right that's absolutely right you are happily married so you haven't fallen victim to this awful trap you're a stay-at-home mother and you're married in the old fashioned way this is you're married in the very old-school way where you find another person and then join with them together but that's because you're not hip enough for Salah gammy you've heard of Salah gammy in 2006 Alexandre Gill married herself she had a ceremony for herself an Italian woman last year Laura Maisy invited 70 guests to a farmhouse in Bimmer caught a to Mary herself a 38 year old British woman named Sophie Tanner in 2015 married herself after her father and that was after her father had given her away to herself so sad mhm the wedding party and hers by the way then danced to kendrick lamar's I love myself Sex in the City mentioned it in 2003 a lead character on Glee in 2010 enjoyed a Salah gomess ceremony is this the most depressing thing ever or is this a force is this is this the perfectly logical conclusion of feminism yeah I mean I probably about really depressing and a farce I think I mean I mean they certainly don't think it's a farce they believe everything that they're saying but yeah I mean I don't even know what that means to marry yourself I mean aren't you already married to your stuff I mean like can you separate from yourself because if you if you can't separate from yourself then you can't marry yourself either I don't I don't think you can even procreate with yourself try try as I have I don't think it's possible it seems like it's slapping lipstick on a pig to use a phrase because you pee these people are alone and it's sad that they're alone and it would be nice probably if they found somebody and probably they could find somebody but rather than say gosh I'm alone and maybe I should change that and somewhere I should do something to change that instead what they do is they say it's good to feel alone yeah I don't feel terrible I feel great about it and it's really sad a kind of related question I guess as we're talking about these traditionalism versus modernism should women stay home to raise their children did you make the right decision I definitely made the right decision for me I mean I there is nothing I could imagine doing other than this and I think that more women probably should do it then and to now but I really I hesitate to say every woman should do something because then I start to sound like the feminist you know so I think what I definitely think is that you this this thing you can have it all you know you can work and you can have your that's not true right if you if you go to work then you're making a decision to parent less and to work less right you had you have to there has to be a give-and-take everywhere so it's a decision that you're making but you have to know that that's the decision that you're making it's not hooray I'm gonna be you know a stay-at-home mom at the same time as being at the office all decisions closed off other opportunities to make one decision is to say no to many other ones you know speaking of decision making Chesterton said that heresy isn't the promotion of Vice over virtue it's the promotion of one virtue to the exclusion of all of the others that today seems to be consent you know most bars and nightclubs now employ a notary public so they can stamp your physical contact consent forms in every single drunken encounter after I think light hand stuff I think that's the point at which you have to go to the notary he will stamp it then you can walk out together I haven't read the statutes in a while why does our culture elevated consent to be more important than anything else because we've elevated sex to be more important than anything else so when when you know well the person that you are about to engage in sexual activity with it's ridiculous to assume that you should have consider it encompasses happening that one of you doesn't like you can't just say so I mean that's fine I mean you probably should have written consent if you decide to have sex with someone you just met at a bar I mean who who knows like what does who this person is and what they're into I mean you don't know you mean it could be Marshall for goodness sakes you don't know who you're gonna mate you've only talked to the person for an hour exactly I hear a little um yeah so I mean I think that's the problem right we we've said that that the sex is more important then the connection or the intimacy or you know love and so then we don't actually know what we're getting it's ironic to it what's ironic in the sense that sex is we're told the sexist meaning less it's casual you can do it whenever you want it's just like shaking a hand at but also it's the most important thing ever so if it's just casual if sex is no that doesn't carry any moral weight then sexual assault is no worse than slapping somebody in the face right because the sexual part doesn't make it any worse or more grave or more serious but of course we know that isn't that isn't true and on this as we're as we're going back in time we go to Chesterton we can go back to Burke Burke wrote about the age of ideologies revolution France proto feminism he said is so prescient in every way he wrote now all is to be changed all the pleasing illusions which made power gentle invidious liberal which harmonized the different shades of life and which by a bland assimilation incorporated into politics the sentiments which beautify and soften private society are to be dissolved by this new conquering Empire of a light and reason all the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off all the super added ideas furnished from a wardrobe of a moral imagination which the heart owns and the understanding ratifies as a necessary to cover the defects of our naked shivering nature and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation are to be exploded as a ridiculous absurd and antiquated fashion on this scheme of things a king is but a man a queen is but a woman a woman is but an animal and an animal not of the highest order and vomit all on edge paid to the sex in general as such and without distinct views is to be regarded as romance and folly regicide and parasite and sacrilege but the fictions of superstition corrupting jurisprudence by destroying its simplicity this feminism ultimately mean that a woman is but an animal and an animal not of the highest order gosh well I lost you a little bit in the feet so I didn't get what you just said but I heard the end of it I I don't know how to answer that I feel like I feel like feminism makes it certainly makes women into something that they're not and I think you know an animal I don't know I please don't record me saying that oh it's okay I turn the recorder off keep it rolling keep I'm sorry yes okay well now you know but I definitely think it makes it makes women in well it makes them an unhappy you know it makes it makes them unhappy because they they can't get what they want which is you know love and intimacy and you know someone to care for them and protect them that's that's what we want that's right and I don't think it turns them into brutes like you know cows or something and doesn't room into angry Bulls II although but looking at that first video perhaps the it's an open question but it doesn't I don't think he means that I think he means it takes away all of the things that elevate us above our animal nature does it to men to actually turns us into just brutes who have no sense of chivalry and because they also don't see any femininity in front of them nothing to elevate men out of our maybe knuckle-dragging beast like nature but faith you're enough to do that to us you're enough to elevate this whole show if we ever had a more elevated show than this usually it's just like me and flexed walks or something is absolutely in the gutter faith thank you for being here we have to move on to the mailbag so nice to see you i you wouldn't you are so

deal while you're gone we'll be right back let's get right into it first question from Ashton hey Michael I have two questions though each are of the same life-altering value first what is your favorite Scotch do you prefer a more PD Scotch like Lagavulin 16 or a sweeter Scotch like Macallan twelve the answer is yes the answer is yes to that question second do you enjoy smoking a pipe as you do cigars I often find the pipe smoking allows you to taste the tobacco a bit more clearly than cigar smoking keep living the cultured life I much prefer cigars I have nine pipes I have some wonderful vintage pipes these Dunhill's from the 60s have a nice Dunhill Mershon pipe that I'll occasionally smoke but one it's very frustrating at a tamp it and packet and all that stuff you can get very high quality tobacco but the tobacco isn't of the same quality because it's not longleaf filler as cigars are it's much less expensive so I like that part of it but I do prefer cigars cigars you just clip it you light it up you smoke it I also once read that's the the three kinds of smoking tobacco correspond to the tripartite soul so the cigarettes are the pathos the appetite because they're kind of addictive and you just want to feed an urge and the cigars are the ethos the spirited part and they go outwards and they're big anything Winston Churchill things like that and then the pipe is the logos the logical part it's both the stem and the bowl male and female and it's the philosopher sitting and contemplating by himself so I'm more into the spirited part give me the the cigar is and the ethos thank good question from Nathan Michael can you answer this question correctly Nathan Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo I hope that helps from James dear Michael what is your view on churches giving to political candidates it's the same view I have a personally giving to political candidates which is I don't put not your trust in Princes where your treasure is there will your heart be also we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so I don't think the churches should be donating to it I think churches have better things to do with their money that said we should certainly this Johnson amendment which since 1954 has prevented churches from endorsing or opposing political candidates theoretically because it actually only stopped Christian churches and Jews and Muslims from endorsing candidates and even that's not quite true it really only stops conservative religious groups from endorsing candidates in 2016 fully twenty eight percent of respondents to a Pew Research poll of people who attended black Protestant churches heard their pastor support Hillary Clinton over a quarter absolutely no consequences whatsoever just 9% of people who attended religious services generally heard clergy speak about a particular political candidate but well over 1/4 of black Protestant churches were preaching the anti gospel of Hillary and that had no effect the reason that they can't do it is because of their tax-exempt status so the government says you don't have to pay taxes on your donations which of course they shouldn't pay taxes on their donations period but they said you don't have to do that but you can't talk about politics you know this really just affects the conservative churches one time I accidentally attended what's called an independent Catholic Church I think they're but they're like not in communion with the Vatican they're very right-wing more than the Society of st. Pius the tenth and they're they're probably I think I think it was excommunicated but anyway I just went there because they did a Latin Mass and I wasn't I wasn't aware and because they're not tax-exempt I heard the guy at the podium he said in the homily the quasi priest I guess he said you know okay the dance will be on Thursday and the picnic will be on Wednesday and don't forget that Tuesday is your last chance to stop the abomination Administration on their path of utter destruction and I really want my church to be able to get down to brass tacks like that and tell us to stop voting for people who want to attack we want to make nuns pay for abortions and who want to kill more babies and and want to raise my taxes all of which are terrible I won't rank them right now on the show so you know left-wing churches get to endorse candidates but forget about that the true Church of the left which is Hollywood in the mainstream media they constantly shill for Democrats so the only people stripped of our First Amendment rights or religious conservatives it's time to do away with the Johnson amendment I hope Trump does it pronto president Trump has been excellent on these issues so very well might it's a totally unfair and on American advantage to the left and it is significantly hasten to the decline in our culture next question from Patrick dear Knowles at all after watching your this day in history on King George the third and remarking on his character and general light handedness on the colonies I had to wonder how justified was the American Revolution if the levied taxes were to pay for a war defending Britain's colonies and the King was generally a good guy was the US right to break away why or why not thanks and love to show Patrick I do have certain certain Tory sensibilities but no it was it was perfectly justified it was quite justified because unlike the French Revolution it was a conservative revolution in America George the third was a decent guy he was generally more lenient and his government on the colonies but he would not assent to representation in Parliament I'm slightly biased here because two of my forebears fought in the revolution one of them died John and Simon Knowles John died at Bunker Hill Simon also fought at Bunker Hill he was young to enlist though he was 16 or even younger and he was with Washington Valley Forge and White Plains so I take some family pride in that and wouldn't want to make them frown from heaven I think it was totally justified because you have highly educated Englishmen in America with a never separating culture half a world away being taxed without representation or very much respect from their imperial government it's not that the taxes were unfair it's that they didn't have a voice in Parliament and George wasn't going to give it to them these colonists were not backwater primitives who had no sense of self-government they weren't Colonials who didn't understand Republic's or democracy or Christianity or the culture it gave birth to self-government they were Englishmen of equal political resources and tradition with their quasi countrymen across the pond had George assented to representation in Parliament the revolution likely would not have come but he didn't and so it came luckily it was a conservative revolution if it preserved tradition rather than like the French tearing apart all of the foundations of society banning Christianity cults of raise and killing priests beheadings regicide hours because it was British and not French was far more orderly and it's a good thing that had happened because it gave the us the requisite independence and distance to remain outside conversations of peace with Hitler or getting bogged down early in war efforts so that we could swoop in and save the old world twice back-to-back world war champions very good thing from Sheamus do you think the act of writing can be seen as inherently narcissistic not the way I do it definitely not the way I do it it depends on what you're writing about if you're writing an empty celebrity tell-all memoir yeah maybe it's narcissistic but if you're writing about something that matters certainly not but beyond narcissism I may be what you're getting at too is that there's a certain areas to writing or confidence in stating your opinion and holding opinion in telling others what to think about the world as former president of Yale rich Levin a lefty but you know Richard Levin was a lefty but he's he's right about a lot of things he observed in a speech one time that the truth is arrogant the truth is arrogant so we have this new culture would say that's your opinion man don't don't young my um don't tell me what to think that's so how arrogant of you the truth is arrogant the truth is it's arrogant to say that two plus two is four because you're saying the two plus two isn't three and if someone says that two plus two is three then you're saying that they're wrong and that they are less learn it or less thoughtful or less intelligent the truth is arrogant that's okay it's all right as long as it's the truth the truth above all things from Mike from Marlee Michael on your program you have related reiterated the importance of majoring in an academically solid field like history or literature rather than social science I'm a music history major and throughout my studies the history especially of early music is highly politicized whenever the origin is in any way based in Christian theology or as a resultant from a church musician discovering a new notation technique there's an ear gut reaction to turn every early musical innovation or work into some analogy for extramarital erotica or some anti religious propaganda how did you combat the politicization of studying something like history it should be factual and concrete but has become more subjective overtime thanks Morley very luckily the one thing Yale does very well is is the history Department actually and that doesn't mean they don't have insane history teachers there that teach nonsense but there's a lot of freedom so they teach everything and so you'll get Donald Kagan or you'll get John Gaddis or Charles Hill or you'll get good teachers there in the field of history who can learn you something and then you can avoid the classes that are bad this does happen a lot with history history can become highly politicized what you have to do is analyze the historical techniques and make sure that you're not learning history through some historicist ridiculous lens and you have to look for the good professors always study the professor's don't who cares what the sub the course subject is all that matters when you're studying an undergraduate is the professor I think it's probably true of graduate school as well that you will learn even if it's a teaching something that you're not necessarily the most interested in go to the good professor who views the world in a normal and rational and thoughtful way you will learn much much more from that person even if it's not in your precise interest from Lisa hi my name is Lisa I know I just said that I'm a new subscriber thank you and would you would like to know what your Kingdom series is that you mentioned at the end of an episode you're absolutely fabulous thank you and my grandparents came from Italy in Spain and I loved how you knew the Italian word for cuckold and what it means go to Nouveau Kota movies oh yeah I heard that one a lot so that's another Kingdom a shameless plug another Kingdom is the podcast that Andrew Clavin wrote that I performed it's now all out so you can binge it just search for Andrew clave ins another Kingdom where ever find narrative podcasts are sold and it's 13 episodes pretty long but the first season is out there so go check it out it's it's a lot of fun and people are binging it and please leave a five-star review it helps us to pitch it to Hollywood and Polk and I in them when they want a black list conservatives from Michael mr. Noles I am hoping you can but a few liberal points I've heard this week concerning the economy word is that members on the Left should not shy away from debating the so-called booming economy as it may not be as great as the right makes it out to be their proof is that is the assertion of points that the stock market grew faster under Obama's first year wages having grown much and growth was higher in the three years preceding Trump also the bonuses being given a tour from tax cuts and of being undercut by large swaths of employees being laid off interesting to hear your thoughts thanks that's not that our friends on the Left are wrong they just know so much that isn't so to begin yes but Barack Obama came out of the worst recession since the Great Depression is he was so fond of telling us and he had a terrible recovery it was a recovery that never really happened but nevertheless it had to go somewhere so yeah yes the economy didn't grow under Barack Obama he couldn't really have fallen any further than it did certain aspects of the economy we can attribute to Donald Trump we were told by all of the lefty predictors that the market would tank and never recover that's what Paul Krugman said if Trump were elected not true it did tank a little bit and then it shot right back up we were told that we would never hit three percent economic growth we've blown past that something at Barack Obama never could do Donald Trump did in his first year consumer confidence is high the IMF the International Monetary Fund no-fun have done I know a fan of Donald Trump said tax cuts tax reform will help the global economy as for the massive layoffs that's just total nonsense the plural of anecdote is not data so if some company lays people off okay but as a matter of the US economy we are the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits in January fell by a thousand to 230,000 which keeps initial US jobless claims near a forty five year low a half-century low in unemployment economists polled by market watch had a forecast of 240,000 in the seven days before we beat it this is the tightest jobs market in decades this is the best time for jobs in decades it's finally causing wages to rise which they haven't done in eight and a half years hmm what happened for the last eight and a half years I wonder what what does that eight and a half year period correspond with that I don't know it comes out of a bat in my head wages for private sector employees have risen 2.8 percent in the last year the biggest year-over-year gain since 2008 huh what happened in 2008 I can't think what I add so strange unemployment is at a 17-year low by other measures the economy added a hundred eighty-five thousand jobs the market is at record highs but of course look the market is going to correct at some point the markets don't track day to day with the presidency and markets go through periods of boom and periods of bust periods of bullish markets and bearish markets and so that'll correct soon I kind of wish president Trump weren't tying his success to the stock market so much because it's going to correct it has to and then Democrats are gonna lambaste him for it but that neither the huge booms are owing to Donald Trump and neither are the busts from Neil hi Michael the Irish Conservative government FINA Gail pronounced FINA Gail after years of mounting pressure in Ireland has announced a vote on repealing article 8 of our Constitution this article pertains for the equal right to life to both the mother and the unborn child could you please shout out to fellow Irish listeners like myself that they can visit check the register I II and take steps to ensure they are on the register if you have an Irish passport you're eligible to vote this also applies to Irish abroad and scattered across the world like myself if you have a passport you can fly home to vote to preserve the sanctity of life in the Republic of Ireland every vote counts thanks a million it would be a damn shame if Ireland allows allows widespread abortion that would be awful so go check it out I'm happy to read that from Nick Almighty Knowles what is your favorite moment in the history of the USA probably have to end on this one guys what is your favorite moment in the history of the USA also what brand of smoking jacket were you wearing on Tuesday night during the State of the Union my favorite moment in the history of United States is the landing at Plymouth that's my favorite one because it wasn't supposed to happen everything conspired against it the government of Holland conspired against it the the English crown conspired against it they the weather conspired against her they were blown way off course they were blown hundreds of miles off course they were supposed to go to Manhattan but they didn't even hit the nice Harbor Boston Harbor that's right above them they landed at this random place in Plymouth and out walks basically the only guy to the to only people on the continent who spoke English and and really Squanto Squanto was the one who really spoke English who had bizarrely lived in London and lived in Spain and it was it's just an example of providence of divine intervention in the founding of America it's undeniable if one looks at the fact of it that bet is the best explanation and it's unsurprising because our pilgrims it's like almost too on-the-nose if you pitch this to Hollywood Hollywood say no it's too on-the-nose that's ridiculous gonna believe that and that's followed by the Battle of Long Island is another one Washington was the Revolutionary War should have ended the Brits should have wiped them out in New York they should never have been able to evacuate and then then the weather changed and Washington was able to get basically everybody out without any casualties just totally it should not have happened and yet it had to happen because if to me seems an evidence of Providence and there were countless other examples throughout our history and an answer the most important question that is a Paul Stewart double clasp double-breasted smoking jacket with I think they're cooler they Turtle clasps or something they don't make it anymore that was given to me by my godmother who is very very nice she's ridiculous probably the nicest article of clothing I'll ever own and she gave it to me and then they stopped making it a year or two later because it turns out that the 18th century 19th century dandy population has starkly declined in recent years so not a lot of people are wearing smoking jackets if you can get your hands on one or a vintage one or something do it they actually work they keep the smoke off of a lot of your clothing and they look very fash and ridiculous okay that's our show that's our week we will be back we have a special show to announce coming next week but I don't I'll leave you wondering about it I hope you can
