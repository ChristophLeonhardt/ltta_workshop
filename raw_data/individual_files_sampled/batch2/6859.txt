President Trump made a cryptic statement during a photo opportunity with military leaders and it scared the crap out of me personally we'll find out what it did to the fellow members of the panel but first let's take a look at it what this represents we have to be great military people there's no contention that we're not great thank you what storm district so you saw that what was your reaction I feel like he's probably trolling and that's kind of like the common wisdom that he's just saying things but my biggest fear is that like we know this I watched The Apprentice but maybe there's other people in this world that are not as tasteless as I am and know who Donald Trump is and so how are other countries looking at our president who's so reckless when speaking about the most powerful military in the world and maybe alluding to using it and some kind of like surprise attack on god only knows who it's so scary to see how the rest of the world is taking this yeah Jimmy you saw it what do you what's your take on this statement well uh you know I think he's just saying stuff but if you look at the what he says the greatest military minds in the world are all in this room and they couldn't couldn't figure out how to beat the Taliban for 18 years now 17 years the greatest military Minds they couldn't figure out how to do Iraq they couldn't figure out a new Libya here we are dropping 26 thousand bombs and serious they'll can't figure out what to do so the greatest military minds of the world don't seem to be getting shit done if you ask me especially with unlimited budget unlimited resources and I don't know if you notice but those those greatest military minds in the world standing up next time from what I could tell we're giggling as he was saying that shit that's what it to be the giggling is what yes crazy because it seemed like you had two schools of thought in the room you had the reporters which I think yes we get rid of reporter with everyone : instead of reporter : that reporter going uh what the hell does that mean and there are audible people in the audience going like yes yeah well the guy standing right next to him I don't know who it was but he was giggling and so look at the guy second over to Trump's right the second guy can't stop smiling and I mean not if you show that video again that you're gonna have to play the audio but you can see them all kind of giggling and laughing and so those are supposed to be the greatest military minds in the world so watch what he's saying the stuff you see that guy can't stops grinning like an idiot I don't know who that guy second over and then this guy here with the crew cut he's in the short hair contest and and then he'll key he'll he'll be good he'll start look at that guy can't stop laughing world greatest military people room I'll tell you that and then watch out this guy like he's kind of half smiling the whole time and who was the woman Melania you see him giggling now that guy's got a whole chest full of medals mm-hm and he's standing there next to the war of the clown president who's making ridiculous threats and he's like ha ha ha it's like it's like watching the film for North Korea wooden and everybody's afraid to say that guy's a maniac you know my god it's ok he said that ha ha ha I bet that guy I wonder who that guy is we should find out well he has to be a trump stick a fan because that's the only people they got hired and get to stay in this administration so to even be in that position to be in that shot he's got to be kissing Trump's ass in some way and finding him adorable so he's surrounded by people by people that are not gonna tell him hey that's a little crazy you shouldn't say that like it's almost their job now to laugh and make him feel good about himself but a lot of people have said that they thought Madison Kelley forget it were doing it to service this for the service of the country and they weren't sick of Fantas to trump or anything I have a hard time believing that Trump doesn't let anybody around him it doesn't do exactly what you said so right and then the other thing that happens in the video is when the reporter is so easily able to rattle off boiling-point crises yeah happening now that you get to choose from when he talks about the calm before the storm I tried to write some down Iran North Korea healthcare the tax plan just randomly firing someone at random I also put down the pissed tape guy talked to Muller today Oh stealing yesterday yeah so the guy who did the piss tape dossier yeah he spoke to Muller maybe there's something about that I just wrote down like random manufactured tragedy who knows he could just make something up or nothing now we tried to we got a little more we I guess we hoped we get more from Sarah Huckabee Sanders she was at the press conference today take a look what she had to say about this moment by the president's comments was he referring to military action he said calm before swine as we've said many times before I know the president has as I have from this podium on quite a few occasions we're never going to say in advance what the president is going to do and as he said last night in addition to those comments you'll have to wait and see how seriously should the American public world or American adversaries for that matter take these comments I think you can take the president protecting the American people always extremely serious he's been very clear that that's this number-one priority and if he feels that action is necessary he'll take it was that anything no no no she doesn't know she has no idea take him for his word take that heat take I think you can take blank for blank like that is her default statement and framing of of any response where she doesn't know what to do and I think when I compared her to spice her she's a worse she's worse than Spicer because at least Spicer you could see was freaking out because he was like bright red and angry and moon but with Sarah I'm dizzy now with Sarah Huckabee Sanders you don't she just is so good at that like dead things that pan yeah you know I feel like she's gonna the job her job is to just cover this and to try and make it seem as normal as possible yeah and she never really changes the inflection in her voice and I think she's really good at the job in a way that we never get answers from her but I think that's kind of what they want is someone who doesn't give us answers and that's what's so frustrating there's another an ACCI us reporter one on MSNBC and he has certain sources within the White House and has ideas about what possibly Trump might be doing here's his take after doing some interviews of people behind the scenes I think it's a high degree of probability that he is trolling everyone and in fact I was talking to a senior official last night somebody who I should stress is not on the NSC who would not be privy to any covert operations and the they started laughing saying don't you get it he's just trolling all of you but of course it's trolling with very serious consequences this is what he does with national security and then he also gave an example of the application of this weird trolling approach as it pertains to other national security and international relations issues take a look but we reported last week a private meeting inside the Oval Office discussing the South Korean trade deal and he says to Robert Lloyd Houser his chief trade negotiator you tell them I'm so crazy I could pull out any minute and that seems to be the sort of madman kind of approach that he's taking with North Korea the sort of Nick Sounion you know make these wild statements these very destabilizing statements and sort of let the chips fall where they may do you take this this is that what you think is happening yes yeah that's what I think is happening why do you think why do you say that I just think that Trump said something he's like all these people in the room he feels he has to say something and he and he's like all the calm before the storm ah what does that mean fuck doesn't mean anything I've said something and it I don't think he was really I just think it was something he said only Trump will make like a calm before the storm reference after two huge storms with another one on the way it was another one on the way like Puerto Rico happens we just got done with his handling miss handling rehan dling man handling of that situation and he makes a calm before the storm reference like it's that doddering and stupid tell us that's right he's a moron if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
