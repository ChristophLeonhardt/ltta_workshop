1
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:10,974
>> Tucker: FOR MORE THAN 100

2
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:11,708
YEARS THE BOY SCOUTS HAVE BEEN A

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,675
PILLAR OF AMERICAN LIFE, BUT

4
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:14,143
TODAY THEY ARE GONE, THEY

5
00:00:14,143 --> 00:00:14,544
DISAPPEARED.

6
00:00:14,544 --> 00:00:15,478
THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA

7
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:18,047
ANNOUNCED THEY WILL BE CHANGING

8
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:20,516
THEM INTO SCOUTS BSA TO ANNOUNCE

9
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:23,887
THE DECISION TO ALLOW GIRLS INTO

10
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:24,888
THE PROGRAM.

11
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:26,155
GIRL SCOUTS I DON'T THINK OUR

12
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:26,856
ADMITTING BOYS.

13
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,424
ALSO A NEW AD CAMPAIGN ATTENDED

14
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:30,860
TO APPEAL TO BOTH GENDERS.

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,995
SCOUT ME IN.

16
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,863
NOT SURPRISINGLY SOUNDS LIKE ONE

17
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:35,465
OF HILLARY CLINTON'S MANY

18
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:35,965
CAMPAIGN SLOGANS.

19
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:36,699
MARK STEYN JOINS US TONIGHT FOR

20
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:39,469
A POSTMORTEM ON THE DEATH OF AN

21
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:42,071
AMERICAN INSTITUTION.

22
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,139
THIS FEELS KIND OF LIKE A

23
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:43,907
WATERSHED MOMENT.

24
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:45,909
MAYBE I'M OVERSTATING ITS

25
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:46,476
IMPORTANCE.

26
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:47,944
>> I DON'T THINK YOU ARE.

27
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:49,679
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS

28
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,349
THAT BOY SCOUTS WERE SO

29
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:54,083
UNIVERSALLY PRESUMED TO BE GOOD

30
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,452
THAT THE VERY NAME BECAME A

31
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:59,088
SYNONYM FOR BEING A GOOD GUY.

32
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:01,291
TWO YEARS AGO, THE FIRST TIME

33
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,727
ANY OF US HAD HEARD OF JAMES

34
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:06,029
COMEY, 90% OF COLONISTS AND

35
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:08,298
COMMENTATORS SAID JAMES COMEY IS

36
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:11,634
RENOWNED IN WASHINGTON AS A

37
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:12,468
BOY SCOUT.

38
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:14,504
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT, THE GOOD

39
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:14,771
GUY.

40
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:17,006
AND THE GENIUS OF THE LEFT IS

41
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:20,109
THAT IN NOTHING FLAT THEY TURNED

42
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,045
THE GOOD GUYS INTO THE BAD GUYS.

43
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:23,279
I REMEMBER GOING TO THE

44
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:24,247
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN

45
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:26,916
LOS ANGELES IN THE YEAR 2000 AND

46
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,118
SOME SCOUTS CAME OUT BEARING THE

47
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,056
FLAG AND THE DEMOCRATS ON THE

48
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:36,592
FLOOR BOOED AND I THOUGHT THIS

49
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:39,095
IS CRAZY, THEY ARE BOOING

50
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:40,063
BOY SCOUTS.

51
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,464
THE DECISION IN THE '90s NOT

52
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:46,302
TO HAVE GAY SCOUTMASTERS.

53
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:49,872
COMPANIES LIKE DISNEY SAID THEIR

54
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:51,274
EMPLOYEES COULD NO LONGER GIVE A

55
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:52,875
CHARITABLE DONATION THROUGH

56
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:53,876
DISNEY TO THE BOY SCOUTS.

57
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,244
BASICALLY THE GOOD GUYS WERE

58
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:56,679
TURNED INTO THE BAD GUYS AND

59
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,283
THAT'S WHY THEY ROLLED OVER ON

60
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:01,017
TRANSGENDER SCOUTS, THEY ROLLED

61
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:03,720
OVER ON GIRL SCOUTS AND NOW THEY

62
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,457
HAVE DRIVEN A STAKE THROUGH THE

63
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:08,191
HEART OF THE INSTITUTION AND IT

64
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,959
IS DEAD.

65
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,595
>> Tucker: IS HAPPENING ON A

66
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:13,262
LARGER STAGE BECAUSE HARVEY

67
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:17,100
WEINSTEIN WAS A PIG, MASCULINITY

68
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,901
IS CRIMINALIZED.

69
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,071
SOMETHING IS LOST HERE.

70
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:23,806
I WANT TO ASK YOU, IT'S MAKING

71
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,375
ME SO DEPRESSED THAT I HAVE TO

72
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,076
MOVE ONTO SOMETHING HAPPY, I'M

73
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:27,377
SORRY.

74
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:29,312
I WAS NEVER EVEN IN THE

75
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:29,712
BOY SCOUTS.

76
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,581
IT'S ONE OF THE LAST WHOLESOME,

77
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:33,683
AT LEAST IN MY MIND, PLACES FOR

78
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:34,050
BOYS.

79
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,652
WHERE ELSE DO THEY GO?

80
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,154
>> I WAS A LOUSY BOY SCOUTS, SO

81
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,355
YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE

82
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:40,356
THAN ME.

83
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:40,890
>> Tucker: I WAS NOT

84
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,658
IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO BE A

85
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:43,526
BOY SCOUT.

86
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,561
I WAS SLOUCH SHOULDERED AND

87
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:45,995
LONG-HAIRED.

88
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:47,163
NANCY PELOSI ON A HAPPIER NOTE

89
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:50,199
SAYS SHE STICKING AROUND GARY ON

90
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,200
TUESDAY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER

91
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,136
SAID SHE PLANS TO RUN AGAIN FOR

92
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:54,771
SPEAKER IF THE DEMOCRATS WHEN

93
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:58,074
THE HOUSE, AND THEY MAY.

94
00:02:58,074 --> 00:02:59,275
REPUBLICANS LOVE THIS.

95
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,910
DEMOCRATS ARE TERRIFIED, BUT

96
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,278
HERE'S MY QUESTION, WHY ARE

97
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:03,913
DEMOCRATS SO AFRAID OF

98
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:04,347
NANCY PELOSI?

99
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:05,081
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A

100
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,815
SPEAKER BUT NONE OF THEM WILL

101
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:07,283
SAY THAT TO HER BECAUSE SHE

102
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:08,751
HOLDS THIS MYSTICAL POWER OVER

103
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,687
THEM, WHY?

104
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,756
>> SHE HAS SAID THINGS THAT

105
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,091
WOULD TAKE OUT ANY NORMAL

106
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:15,525
POLITICIAN.

107
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,993
WE HAVE TO PASS THE BILL SO YOU

108
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:20,296
CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S IN IT.

109
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:21,697
SHE'S IN FAVOR OF OPEN BORDERS

110
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:22,432
AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SHE IS

111
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:26,869
IN FAVOR OF MANDATORY

112
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:28,071
CONTRACEPTION USE SO THAT NO

113
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:28,838
AMERICANS WERE ALREADY HERE HAVE

114
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:29,705
ANY CHILDREN.

115
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,942
SHE'S A MASSIVE CONTRADICTIONS

116
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:35,878
AND INANE STATEMENTS.

117
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:36,646
BUT UNLIKE REPUBLICAN LEADERS,

118
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:40,616
SHE IS A RUTHLESS OPERATOR AND

119
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,518
IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT AND YOU

120
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:43,920
RUN UP AGAINST NANCY PELOSI,

121
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,620
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT TOO

122
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,690
WELL FOR YOU.

123
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,058
SHE'S SERIOUS AND SHE'S TELLING

124
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:50,560
THEM BACK OFF BECAUSE WHEN WE

125
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,861
WENT BACK IN NOVEMBER I'M GOING

126
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:52,795
TO BE THE SPEAKER, DON'T GET IN

127
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:55,731
MY WAY.

128
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:57,800
>> Tucker: A MASSIVE

129
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,303
CONTRADICTIONS AND STATEMENTS

130
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:01,471
BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE MAYOR OF

131
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:02,338
BALTIMORE, SHE KNOWS HOW TO

132
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:04,540
COUNT VOTES AND SHE'S TOUGH AND

133
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,676
TOUGHNESS IN THE END IS DECISIVE

134
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:07,410
TOUGHNESS IN THE END IS DECISIV

135
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:07,777
DECISIVE.

136
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:09,612
DO THINK IT SORT OF A MEASURE

137
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:11,514
HOW WEAK A LOT OF DEMOCRATIC

138
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,281
MEMBERS ARE THAT THEY ARE AFRAID

139
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:16,519
OF A 78-YEAR-OLD FORMER SPEAKER?

140
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,887
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE

141
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:18,620
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, SHE'S ACTUALLY

142
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,726
A YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPER.

143
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,061
BERNIE SANDERS -- USE OF THE

144
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,096
BOY SCOUTS WERE 108 YEARS OLD.

145
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:27,864
I THINK BERNIE SANDERS WAS ONE

146
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:30,366
OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS BACK IN

147
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:37,874
WHATEVER IT IS, 1910.

148
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:40,476
SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG THING

149
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:41,878
COMPARED TO MOST OF THE

150
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:42,278
DEMOCRATS.

151
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:43,479
>> Tucker: I THINK BERNIE WAS

152
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,282
A YOUNG PIONEER, FOR THE RECORD.

153
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:46,749
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

154
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,017
>> Tucker: IN HIS SPEECH TO

155
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:49,485
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS TODAY,

156
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:53,489
MICHELLE OBAMA SAID THIS, WATCH

157
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:53,856
WATCH.

158
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:55,458
>> I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ME AND IF

159
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,193
I CAN BE STANDING HERE AS YOUR

160
00:04:57,193 --> 00:05:01,297
FOREVER FIRST LADY THEN YOU CAN

161
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,933
DO ANYTHING YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO

162
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:04,267
DO ANYTHING YOU PUT YOUR MIND T

163
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:04,533
TO.

164
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,069
>> Tucker: YOU ARE ME.

165
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:08,271
BROUGHT IT BACK TO ME.

166
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:11,741
BUT WHATEVER.

167
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,342
>> I DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE THE

168
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:16,145
IDEA OF -- THERE'S A TERM FOR A

169
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:19,215
FOREVER FIRST LADY, IT'S QUEEN.

170
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:24,086
AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ON

171
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:24,654
REPUBLICAN ABOUT THIS.

172
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:26,756
WHEN I HEAR IT IN CONTEXT LIKE

173
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,724
THAT I DO WONDER IF SHE'S JUST

174
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:31,861
READING OUT SOME SAPPY SOFT ROCK

175
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:32,528
SONG BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT

176
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:35,064
SOUNDS LIKE.

177
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:38,301
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ME, YOU ARE

178
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:38,868
MY FOREVER FIRST LADY.

179
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:42,104
>> Tucker: [LAUGHS]

180
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:43,806
>> NUMBER 37 IN 1988, KENNY

181
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:44,974
LOGGINS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

182
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:50,646
JAMES TAYLOR, JOHN KERRY FLEW

183
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,581
JAMES TAYLOR.

184
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:54,784
YOU ARE MY FOREVER FIRST LADY.

185
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:58,287
IT'S A GREAT SONG BUT IT IS ON

186
00:05:58,287 --> 00:05:58,888
REPUBLICAN.

187
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:02,258
I THINK THE BEST TERM FOR

188
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:06,262
MICHELLE OBAMA IS MRS. OBAMA.

189
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:08,664
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS PRACTICE

190
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:09,899
OF EXTENDING GOVERNOR AND

191
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,867
SENATOR TITLES FOR LIFE.

192
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:15,271
YOU ARE BETTER OFF WITH THE

193
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,472
DUKES BECAUSE TITLES LIKE THAT

194
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:19,875
ARE IN THE GIFT OF THE PEOPLE.

195
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,643

CALLING YOU DOCTOR.

200
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:30,286
A REMIX OF THAT SONG, I'M

201
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:30,886
SPEECHLESS.

202
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:31,921
THANK YOU.

203
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:33,889
>> IT'S A GREAT SONG.

204
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,891
NUMBER 37 IN 1988.
