DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CREDENCE TO THE PRESIDENT'S CLAIM THAT YOU BROKE THE LAWS RELEASING THE MEMOS? NO. I THINK HE'S MAKING STUFF UP. Laura: THE UP RETURNED FIRE ON "FOX AND FRIENDS." COMEY IS A LEAKER AND A LIAR. HE LEAKED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO GET A SPECIAL COUNSEL. HE'S GUILTY OF CRIMES. IF WE HAD A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOING THEIR JOB Laura: AND IN HIS FOX NEWS INTERVIEW WITH BRET BAIER, COMEY RESPONDED TO TRUMP'S ACCUSATIONS. HE'S JUST WRONG. FACTS REALLY DO MATTER. THAT'S WHY I'M ON THE SHOW. THE MEMO IS UNCLASSIFIED. IT'S IN MY BACK. THE FBI CLEARED THAT BOOK BEFORE IT COULD BE PUBLISHED. IT'S A FALSE STATEMENT. Laura: LET'S SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION WITH OUR PANEL. JIM JORDAN AND BYRON YORK, RICHARD GOODSTEIN, A FORMER ADVISER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON. I WANT TO PLAY PART OF THIS INTERVIEW TONIGHT WHERE BRETT ASKED ABOUT THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION AND THE COMPARISON. LET'S WATCH. YOU CAN SEE THE DISPARITY WHERE PEOPLE LOOK AT THE CLINTON CASE AND HOW THE TRUMP CASE IS HANDLED. I DON'T SEE DISPARITY THOUGH. THERE IS A DISPARITY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE IT. THE PRESIDENT IS NOT WRONG. HE'S NOT MAKING THINGS UP. HE'S NOT MAKING UP THE FACT THAT THEY CALLED SHERYL MILLS Laura: SHERYL MILLS WAS CLINTON'S LAWYER AND HER CHIEF OF STAFF AND THE SUBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION WHEN THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION STARTED. COMPARE THAT TO THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER GETS HIS DOOR KICKED IN AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES I DON'T EVEN THINK WAS CONSULTED. IT WAS RUN OUTSIDE OF THE UMBRELLA OF THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, THE MUELLER SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. YOU DON'T TAKE TO THE HIGHEST OFFICERS IN THE LAND WHEN YOU KICK IN THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER'S DOOR? OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE UNSET AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE UPSET. BYRON, THERE WAS A MOMENT THAT THEY DISCUSSED WHO FUNDED THE DOSSIER. YOU'VE BEEN WRITING ABOUT THIS. LET'S WATCH. WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT THE DNC AND HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN FUNDED CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S WORK? I STILL DON'T KNOW THAT FOR A FACT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I ONLY SAW IT IN THE MEDIA. I KNEW IT WAS FUNDED FIRST BY REPUBLICANS THAT'S NOT TRUE. I'M SORRY? THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE DOSSIER WAS FOUNDED BY THE REPUBLICANS? DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO IT WAS FUNDED BY? I WANTED TO KNOW WHO I KNEW. IT WAS FUNDED BY PEOPLE POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP. WHICH PARTICULAR OPPONENTS WASN'T IMPORTANT TO ME. THIS WAS A STUNNING MOMENT. HE SHOWED APPARENT IGNORANCE OF THE BASIC FACTS OF THE DOSSIER, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THE WHOLE TRUMP Laura: WHY? IT WAS THE MAIN BASIS FOR THE APPLICATION TO SPY ON CARTER PAGE. AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT COMEY AND THE OTHER INTEL CHIEFS BRIEFED PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP ON ON JANUARY 26, 2017 STARTING THE WHOLE FIGHT BETWEEN TRUMP AND COMEY. IT'S A HUGELY IMPORTANT DOCUMENT. TALKING POINT THAT IT BEGAN WITH REPUBLICANS. WE KNOW ANYBODY HAS FOLLOWED KNOWS THAT THE FUSION GPS RESEARCH INTO TRUMP'S BUSINESS LIFE BEGAN WITH REPUBLICANS. THEY QUIT THAT. THEN THE STEELE DOSSIER WAS FUNDED BY DEMOCRATS. Laura: ISN'T THAT SHOCKING? YOU'VE SOLD 600,000 BOOKS, WHICH IS AMAZING. YOU WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THIS. YOU'RE ON BRET BAIER'S SHOW. OH, IT'S WHAT I READ IN THE MEDIA. YOU WERE FBI DIRECTOR. YOU USED THIS DOCUMENT. RICHARD, I'M SORRY, BUT THAT DID STRIKE ME AS QUITE A STUNNER. IF I CAN, CONGRESS MADE REFERENCE TO SHERYL MILLS, HILLARY CLINTON'S LAWYER. DONALD TRUMP WHO SAID ON AIR FORCE ONE, CALL MY LAWYER, MICHAEL COHEN. FAMOUSLY SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN, IF YOU TAKE THE FIFTH, IT'S BECAUSE YOUR GUILTY. THAT'S WHAT MOB PEOPLE DO. MILLS NEVER TOOK THE FIFTH NOBODY IN THE CLINTONS TOOK THE FIFTH OTHER THAN THE ONE GUY Laura: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE FIFTH. THEY GAVE HER IMMUNITY. THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN ANYBODY THEY WANTED Laura: WHY DID THEY GIVE HER IMMUNITY? THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THE SUGGESTION THERE'S A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO. CARTER PAGE IS ONE OF FIVE FOREIGN POLICY ADVISERS THAT DONALD TRUMP NAMED AND THE FBI HE WAS A FOREIGN AGENT. EXCUSE ME. THAT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DONALD TRUMP WENT INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND GAVE RUSSIANS SECRETS ABOUT THE ISRAELIS BEING EMBEDDED AND WAYS IN WHICH THE ISLAMIC TERRORISTS Laura: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR THAT IS ON THIS NETWORK TONIGHT THAT MADE COMMENTS THAT WERE A RUN OF THE MIDDLE PUNDIT ON ANY CABLE NETWORK WOULD KNOW THE ANSWERS TO, WHICH I FOUND UNBELIEVABLE. I WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER SOUND BITE. THIS IS ON THE FISA APPLICATION ITSELF. BYRON, YOU'VE WROTE ABOUT THIS. CONGRESSMAN, YOU'VE BEEN DISSECTING THIS. LET'S WATCH. CALL THE DOSSIER UNVERIFIED, SALACIOUS. WHY DID YOU USE THAT TO THE FISA COURT TO ASK FOR SURVEILLANCE FOR CARTER PAGE? YOU LED WITH IT, A BULK OF THE FISA APPLICATION DEALS WITH THAT DOSSIER. WHY? THAT'S NOT MY RECOLLECTION, BRET. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE FISA APPLICATION HAS BEEN RELEASED. THERE WAS A LOT MORE THAN THE DOSSIER IN THE FISA APPLICATION? MY RECOLLECTION THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME ABOUT PAGE AND WHY THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE THAT HE WAS AN AGENT. IS THAT TRUE? NO. WHEN YOU LEAD WITH IT, THAT'S YOUR PRIMARY EVIDENCE Laura: HAVE YOU SEEN THE ENTIRE FISA APPLICATION? WE HAVE NOT. Laura: WHY? THEY WON'T LET US. I ASKED CHRISTOPHER WRAY. THEY WON'T SHOW US. Laura: WOW. THEY DIDN'T TELL THE COURT WHO PAID FOR IT. THEY DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE DOCUMENT, CHRISTOPHER STEELE, HAD HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FBI TERMINATED. THEY DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT. WHEN WE GO TO THE COURT, WE HAVE TO TELL THEM THE WHOLE TRUTH. THEY DIDN'T TO THAT. REMEMBER THE HOUSE INTEL FOUND OUT THAT THE DOSSIER WAS THE BULK OF IT AND SEPARATELY THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS THE BULK OF IT. Laura: HE ALSO SAID HE DIDN'T SEE ANY BIAS IN THE PAGE-STRZOK TEXT WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE INSURANCE POLICY. THEY WERE CLEARLY NOT WILD ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. EVEN THAT'S BEEN SAID ON OTHER NETWORKS. BUT HE DIDN'T SEE ANY BIAS. AGAIN, THERE WERE REPUBLICANS ON THIS NETWORK AND OTHERS THAT WERE SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN THAT STRZOK WAS. STRZOK WAS SAYING THE SAME THINGS Laura: BUT NOT INVESTIGATING HIM. HE WAS SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT ERIC HOLDER. THEY WERE DISHING DIRT OR TRASHING EVERYBODY THEY COULD. SO TO SUGGEST STRZOK WAS A PERSON THAT SUGGESTED THAT COMEY DO THE LETTER THAT BASICALLY WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR HILLARY CLINTON. I DON'T THINK IT WASN'T BIAS. IT WAS ANIMUS TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT. PETER STRZOK IS THE DEPUTY HEAD OF COUNTER INTELLIGENCE. HE'S BEEN DEMOTED AND REASSIGNED FOR HIS BEHAVIOR. Laura: THE COLUMBIA LAW PROFESSOR TO WHOM COMEY GAVE THAT THOSE MEMOS, TWO OF THE SIX MEMOS AND HE BASICALLY INSTRUCTED HIM TO GET THEM OUT THERE. NOW WE FIND OUT, WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW, MAYBE YOU KNEW THIS, THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY A SPECIAL CONSULTANT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT? AND WE NOW FIND OUT THAT HE'S NOW OPERATING AS COMEY'S ATTORNEY. HIS LAWYER. Laura: IS THAT RELEVANT? GIVES YOU ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE IT HELPS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID TO GET THE MEMOS OUT. IT WAS A STUNNING RE-LATION. COMEY DOES NOT CONSIDER WHAT HE DID LEAKING. HE HAS REDEFINED LEAKING TO MEAN ONLY DISCLOSES CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. HE BELIEVES HE'S SAID SEVERAL TIMES THAT HE DIDN'T LEAK WHEN HE GAVE THIS MEMO TO DAN RICHMAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF RICHMAN TELLING THE "NEW YORK TIMES" ABOUT IT. COMEY MAINTAINS THAT THIS WAS NOT A LEAK. HE ALSO SAID IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A LEAK BECAUSE HE LEFT THE FBI AND WAS NO LONGER A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS WROTE A BOOK ABOUT CONVERSATIONS WITH BILL CLINTON. SCOTT McCLELLAND BROKE A BOOK AFTER THEY WERE OUT OF OFFICE. THAT'S THE CASE. THAT COMEY WAS OUT OF OFFICE AND HE WAS NO MORE OF A LEAKER THAN GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS OR Mc GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS OR M McCLELLAND WAS. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT KEPT THEM AS IF THEY WERE STATE SECRETS. FEW MEMBERS WERE ALLOWED TO SEE THEM. YOU HAD DO HAVE AN FBI MINDER WITH THEM. NO NOTES, NO COPIES. Laura: IT'S CONTRARY TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS NOBODY ON CAPITOL HILL BELIEVES THIS IS THE ONLY LEAK THAT JAMES COMEY DID THERE RICHMAN. I MANY GUESS IS THERE WERE TONS. HE HAD EMPLOYEES WITH THE SGE STATUS. I'M GUESSING HE DID LOTS OF
