at a time of national trial when the good people of the great state of Texas are suffering under a horrific natural disaster even some of the worst people in the country are lifting their eyes toward heaven I'm speaking of course of American mainstream media journalists even in the deepest cesspits of satanic sin like CNN or the New York Times a former newspaper the most desiccated twisted Souls destined for a flaming hell of unbearable suffering like CNN or the New York Times a former newspaper are looking to God and asking him the one question that is first and foremost on every mainstream media journalist mind dear Lord how can we find a way to blame this hurricane on Donald Trump even a heart of stone must pity these miserable sinners in their distress that may be not but it is kind of pathetic to watch their struggles journalists have tried claiming the Trump shouldn't have gone to the scene of the hurricane because it diverted needed resources but people still remember how they blame george w bush for not going to the scene of a hurricane so this only makes the journalist look like dishonest biased corrupt democrat hacks who wouldn't know the truth if it rose up like an alligator out of the flood waters and bit them on the backside not that i'm hoping that will happen it would be kind of comical you must admit they've tried blaming trump for not believing in their hysterical hype about the naturally changing climate but meteorologists confirm that this hurricane had nothing to do with the changing climate and so the journalists only managed to make themselves look like brain-dead ill-informed left-wing propagandists who wouldn't know a fact if it's sidled up beside them like a gigantic elephant and crapped on their heads not that i would wish that almond okay wait I probably would wish that on them anyway they've been blaming Trump for tweeting but it turned out Trump was capable of tweeting with one hand while arranging for the federal government to coordinate disaster relief with the other so the journalists only ended up looking like petty spiteful hate-filled lowlifes who wouldn't admit Trump was doing a good job if you stuck a pair of pliers down their throats and dragged the words one by one which I would never do probably amazingly the journalists have even attacked Melania Trump for wearing high heels as she got on the transport to go give comfort to the victims of the disaster an attack so sexist rude and stupid that had only served to make the journalist seem like sexist rude and stupid petty spiteful hateful brain-dead ill-informed dishonest bias corrupt democrat hack lowlife left-wing propagandists who looks so appalling next to the decent everyday Americans they despise that I could almost feel for them if I weren't busy feeling for those decent everyday Americans who make journalists look like Afifi trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show no singing I hope I wasn't being

words about them because we all attack them but there are some of them I actually want to say nice words but there's a video going around of a victim in of the hurricane who has just gotten her kids off the roof you know and got him out and the CNN reporter comes up to her and she goes off on her nobody could blame her obviously for going off and for just being hyped up and this has been kind of going viral because everybody likes to see CNN picked on as in fact CNN as an institution well deserves so here is this moment when this this poor woman actually has had enough of being interviewed me I said here y'all try to interview people during their worst times like this not the smartest thing to do like people are really breaking down and y'all sitting here with cameras and microphones trying to ask us what them is wrong with it you're really trying to understand with the microphone still in my face so I have to say that obviously we all love to see reporters get yelled at but the woman I actually felt for the woman from CNN that's her job that is her job I've had to do this job it is so unpleasant I have had to call mourning parents on the day their kids died it is just a terrible terrible thing and the thing is you're putting together a story the only way that a news agency can put together a story is one person at a time a story like this that is massive and big you have to you have to do this and so obviously the woman you know one can blame the victim for going off on the woman but but this is what they have to do and you know the media was insanely unfair and incompetent in covering Katrina I mean they reported all kinds of atrocities that didn't happen they treated george w bush like it was to his fault the levees broke which was insane it was the fault of a Democrat government one of the most corrupt governments in the world was New Orleans up until that moment and and yet and yet even so by putting pressure on the government the response to Hurricane Harvey has been much better because they have corrected the mistakes they made for Hurricane Katrina so before I rip these reporters as they deserve let's take a look you know when when a big story like this happens local reporters get their big chance and so they were out there for the first time you know you're on some little station in the middle of nowhere or a little station even in Houston which is not that little but still you're not on a national scale and suddenly you're covering a national story here are a couple of reporters I'm gonna name them KH o u 11 reporter Brandi Smith this is a CBS affiliate she was in the middle of doing his story don't don't run she was in the middle of doing his story when she saw a truck sinking in the water and a truck driver stuck inside it and remember this is a woman who was getting the big chance of her career and she wants to stay on camera and do a good job Edie Lavin dara from CNN saw an elderly couple and helped them into a boat KTRK which is an ABC affiliate reporter for t Calot celeritas rescued some disabled people off a roof and my even though even though it's not as important but it still touched me as meteorologist Paul Goodloe from The Weather Channel who saw an American flag in the wreckage here's a montage of these reporters the incident response team that was over here on the hardy toll road is not here here we go we have a boat coming we have a boat coming I'm gonna flag I'm gonna flag these guys down and see hold on just a sec are you guys are you guys headed down to the truck right here there's a truck driver stuck here in about ten feet of water thank you we were about to leave this neighborhood there was a woman who would kind of flag us down that her nor two elderly parents were still stuck inside the home so I'm gonna put the mic down we're gonna help them try to get back into into the boats look they're flashing the light I think they probably want us to maybe get one of those people that's up there we could take you guys if you need an elderly sick person yeah bring two handicapped two sick and disabled in two in wheelchairs right now I don't know how strong the winds have to be to cut a palm tree in half but that's what happened to the top of this tree but next to it we've got Old Glory I just I can't let go of glory just sit here like that the school yeah it's battered so was the flag but we've got to fold this up make sure this isn't a casualty to Hurricane Harvey that's great stuff as great stuff you know these are local reporters obviously getting a big break and putting aside their story for a minute to help people out and I think they deserve tribute most of the time in in our I you know I have real serious problems as anyone who listens to this or watches the show knows with our media I think that they are the source of so much of the political problems in our country by dividing us by selling this narrative that there is a Democrat they're just all Democrats and they talk to Democrats and they think they're not being biased they actually are under the delusion that they're not being biased because each one of them reinforces the other's opinion and they push this narrative that there is their Democrat policies and then there's hatred Democrat policies and hatred that's it and that's this is where the justification of these Anti Fog guys going out and beating people up they think oh you know you disagree with us you're hateful there's some certain things that can't be stood without answering them with violence like anyone who disagrees with us and that is the narrative the media pushes but most of the time it is not street reporters street reporters are most of them animals they want the facts they want to get the incident they want to be on the scene they want to see what goes down they want to find the information and get it back it's when it hits the editorial staff and the the guys at the desks that this the pollution of this bias starts to occur so yesterday we just saw this in spades I mean it was unbelievable Donald Trump went down - he went down to Corpus Christi he didn't want to go to Houston because that's where all the stuff is happening he didn't want to divert resources that you know takes a lot of resources obviously to take care of the president so he didn't do that went down to Corpus Christi and he taught let's just take a look first he went out and he talked to a crowd at a place where they you know they were gathering the the people who were at homes I will tell you this is historic so we remember of course that george w bush he was at his ranch and when Hurricane Katrina hit he did not immediately go down he flew over it because he didn't want to divert resources he didn't want to divert resources for him and they just remember you know george w bush doesn't like black people and the black people you know the racist coverage was unbelievable the black people were eating each other in the stadiums things like that was just totally untrue completely untrue but they that coverage was all blamed on george w bush so Donald Trump goes down and he makes an appearance and so what they said was they made fun of him because he said what a great crowd and they thought well it's a refugee area so of course is a great crowd but he was referring to the fact that people drove up to see him they were cheering him there were about a thousand people that the press didn't even turn their cameras on and they were cheering and waving him and he reacted to that as anybody would and so he was cheering people up and then he went and he talked to uh was Greg Abbott as the governor's name right and he talked and he went to the the emergency center and gave thanks to all the people around and in typical trumpian terms he talked about the fact that they're gonna do a good job and take care of everybody I can tell you that my folks just telling me how great your representatives have been and working together it's a real team we want to do it better than ever before we want to be looked at in five years in ten years from now as this is the way to do it this was proportion nobody has ever seen anything like this thank you very much we won't say congratulations we don't want to do that he gets that just right we're not gonna congratulate each other because it's still underway we know there are mistakes that can be made with this is obviously what has happened to Houston is now happening in Louisiana too as hurricane Harvey moves along the Gulf you know this is going gonna go on for years this is what is happening now is gonna go on for years people are gonna be homeless rebuilding is gonna be just terribly terribly difficult finding housing for people and all this stuff the government is going to be involved in this for years this is what the government is for this is when this is when we can all agree that government has to do what it has to do and and the word is that so far Trump is doing a great job and you know this is the funny thing about the whole Trump this is what he does this is what he likes you know he wants to fix stuff he does this is the the best thing about him is he wants to fix stuff you ask him about when they asked him about racism he said it's gonna get better cuz people are gonna have jobs and people and their pay is gonna be good because I'm gonna fix that you know he doesn't have a spiritual sense of the world that he has to go out and sort of lead people in their spirits what he does is he fixes stuff and this is a big big big fix a job and he is in his element heavy Troy at The Wall Street Journal right so far his administration is largely getting praised for effective handling of the crisis Washington's disaster authorities appear to be in sync with the state on roles and responsibilities which is very big I'm sure you've all seen crime shows on television where the state and the local cops and the feds raid our odds that really does happen the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA and its leader brock long the resources as Harvey approached and the government response as a whole appears well coordinated I give FEMA a grade of a plus all the way from the president down Texas governor Greg Abbott told Fox News Sunday and yes Mr Abbott is a fellow Republican but he is also interested in protecting Texas and would not have said a-plus if the state weren't getting what it needed that assessment is backed up by Rear Admiral W Craig Vander wagon a former career emergency manager who is plugged into the Harvey effort early read he told heavy troy in an email is that executive branch is performing well under this precedent okay that's all you need to know this all anybody has to say you don't like Donald Trump too bad he's doing a good job the people are in trouble the president is there this is a montage of the talking point between MSNBC and CNN the talking point all day yesterday as they covered this and it is I mean it's a disgrace it's a disgrace you know Athene's never been as strong hug a mom or hold a baby or shake someone's hand or ask a senior how they were doing it was really remarkable he acted like this was a big field trip and it was the biggest in the best response and we're gonna congratulate her each other later it was typical Donald Trump was that without an ounce of them but is he ever had been exposed to whistling and Jim those words there show that the president is still very much learning on the job in terms of empathy learning on jobs on the job in terms of how to react and relate to the individuals here who are you know where the human element seemed to be absent outside of the self congratulatory gestures of the conference I mean of the press conference it seems to me it's just concerned about optics just concerned about optics and I want to be concerned I wish they would be concerned about people they were saying that it's going to be key to see the way he has real feelings and real empathy how does he respond in this first big situation like this what will you be looking for is the empathy factor there's the response there is making people feel like he's engaged he's going to be alliteration that's what President Trump is trying to convey today in his visit and appropriately so he is going to have to show some real feeling some real empathy to the people in Texas that have been hit in this devastating manner in that way it remains to be seen what the empathy factor is going to be here so basically what they're saying is he doesn't pretend to care the way we pretend you know we really pretend well we pretend to care all he's doing is helping people encouraging them making sure the money gets there making sure all the services get there that's not pretending to care the way we pretend we put on these sad seriously faces we're really good at this he's not so good I mean it is absolutely disgraceful and just before we break I have to just point out that that one guy on CNN with the glasses that's Jeff Zeleny who used to be the White House correspondent of the New York Times and used the opportunity to first question the new President Barack Obama to ask this classic classic question Thank You mr. president during his first 100 days what has surprised you the most about this office enchanted you the most about serving in this office humbled you the most and troubled you the most now let me write this down it's like it's all it's all just hatred being generated by them we have to break from Facebook and YouTube and the mailbag is coming up this means that you are going to be stuck mired in your problems unless you come on over to the Daily wire calm to listen and while you're there you could subscribe and watch the show and be on them in the mailbag yourself you can even send in questions live while I'm talking and we will try to answer those as well and if you subscribe for the year it's only a lousy 100 bucks left us tears no steven crowder we have to go on with us just a little bit because the coverage of this I mean who do they think they're kidding that they think anybody's anybody this stupid I mean I guess if you already are ravening with Trump hatred if the drool is zombie look in your eyes it's like you're so hate this president that you just want to feed the hatred I mean I notice when you go on the New York Times website the most popular articles are always the ones attacking Donald Trump let's take a little trip for a minute to the op-ed page of the New York Times or as we like to call it knucklehead roe Frank Bruni you just spews hatred I mean it's just all he does he says the waters swell sodas Trump's ego I would like to believe that what fascinated Donald Trump about the floodwaters of Texas and pulled him to the state on Tuesday with the scenes of human suffering I would also like to believe that I'm a dead ringer for Brad Pitt he could have said I would also like to believe I'm a journalist but what Trump saw in hurricane Harvey was a mirror of his own majesty a storm worthy of a stud like him a meteorological complement to one of his resorts rallies or steaks something really really big he was just there to feed his own ego my question is that is like what is he reporting he's reporting his own hatred that's all he's reporting is no facts there's no you know there's nothing to say that this is what Trump was doing Trump went down there to help and he's been trying to fix things here's here's my favorite this is from slate.com Houston doesn't showcase America at its best it's Katie wall but I swear these people are like they're just like uh you know they've been the hatred has turned them into zombies it's misleading to characterize Houston as an exhibition of the best of America when what it represents is a contingent America a paradise specific to the hell around it these waterlogged suburbs have become zones of exemption where norms hang suspended in something lovelier and more communal has been allowed to flourish in their place what she's saying is she's referencing the theory and making reference to a theory that in emergencies the best come out of people but then they go back to being awful which is you know that's ridiculous in an emergency that's when people are called upon to do their best and they do but these people are neighbors and friends and their different colors and all the state they're so invested in telling themselves that we hate one another as much as they hate us that's what it really comes down to it's we hate one another they want to make sure that we hate one another as much as they despise us this is the mainstream media on display if the best has been brought out in the citizens of Houston why hasn't it brought out the best in why is the New York time the New York Times is attacking Melania Trump's shoes and not just the New York Times all over she wore these stiletto heels to get on the transport to go and on the transport she as women often do she changed into the what the shoe she needed she changes into sneakers Vanessa Friedman the New York Times when is a shoe not just a shoe when it is a pair of very high needle thin heels worn by the First Lady of the United States on her way to the site of a natural disaster then it becomes a symbol for what many sees the disconnect between the Trump administration and reality another example of the way in which this president and his family can continue to define appropriate their own way and an excuse for partisan name-calling that's the New York Times and The Washington Post there was no pretense about Melania Trump's heels but sometimes a little pretense ELPS Milan this is Robin given Melania Trump is the kind of woman who travels to a flood-ravaged State and a pair of black snakeskin stilettos you know isn't me this is the most sexist that what businesses are hookers what they wear you know I mean what businesses are there there's what she wears even Trevor Noah unfunny comedian but a total reliable leftist even he went off on this listen to him she went to Houston wearing high heels oh and she's getting a lot of flack firts online predominantly but it counts and here's my thing I don't know why anyone should care what anyone wears when they're on their way to help people and people were like why is she wearing those heels which is gonna help people like who cares look at the Pope you see how he dresses Oh white with giant bleed looks like he's going to a pity party like we don't say hey you can't go out helping people dressed like that oh that's actually fairly funny yeah you know what's what is funny about all this is that the news is trying to create the image of itself they are trying to create this image they are so partisan so one side is so filled with hate for this president I mean really they are filled with hate for this president and we get back to that at the end of the show in our tickety-boo news segment we're going to talk about the president some more talk about a balanced way of looking at him but they're so filled with hate that they want to find the division they feel within themselves they want to find it everywhere they cannot simply report when the president does a good job they can't do it they want to make sure that hate keeps boiling they want to make sure we stay divided they want to make sure anti fossil has some you know justification for the violence they do because that violence is inspired and condoned by the way the press treats Trump and they just want to make sure that the narrative of this is a racist divided hate filled country never goes away because that's what's in their hearts as Jesus said it's what comes out of a man's heart that corrupts a man and these people we are watching their corruption it is absolutely disgusting especially especially when you put it next to the everyday Americans of every color in every description in every politics I'm sure you put them next to that these everyday guys who the press despises who are rising to these levels of nobility and grandeur and decency that just make the press they they just look disgusting they look disgusting I hope I I hope I was wasn't beating around the bush there I hope I'm clear on how I feel about our mainstream media it's the mail bag from Richard a writer of books with words Cleveland a reference to our friend Michael Knowles who can't seem to understand what all those pages between the covers are for you are clear I'm gonna be on those a show later on so you are clearly working many hours spending long days perfecting shows and carving out time for yes I am have you struggled to find a balance between life and work in this phase of intense creativity because a large segment of your audience or conservative capitalists we also grapple with this issue and yes of course you know I solve almost all problems the same way by waking up earlier and I've always said there's very few problems in life that can't be solved by waking up earlier and everybody thinks that they need a lot of sleep and they do everything they can to tell you that you need a lastly you know I don't need that much sleep myself I don't even I don't even sleep when I'm in bed you know when I go to bed you know but I find look I wake up at 5:30 and I basically greet my wife and at 5:30 I start reading the news and I start preparing for this show I'm working pretty much straight through every now and again I'll doze off for a couple of minutes but I don't sleep for more than 10 minutes at a time I'll sit and eat but that takes what you know 15 minutes to half an hour I'm working straight through if you start working at 5:30 you should be done by 7:00 7:30 I mean that's like the late you know that's that's when you should be done there are days when I go longer but it's usually because something distracted me then you know you have some hours to spend with your family and you know with the people you love and on life so I mean it's just making your days fit it's making your days fit your schedule not making your schedule fit your days basically that's it so it takes a little bit more time I really only take one day of a weekend off I love my work which helps a lot it's not slaving away something I really enjoy but I do make sure I do make sure that I have time for the people in my life because they're actually more important from Sam supreme grand overlord Clavin in your always humble opinion when was my opinion ever humble how would you suggest mending ties with old friends or people you haven't spoken to in ages your dutiful underling Sam you know first of all I really do recommend this I had a pal die who I had had a break with long ago and he was a very far leftist he was a novelist I'll tell you his name was Neil Gordon he wrote recently Robert Redford made a film of one of his books all the promises you something you keep I can't remember it can you look that up Boston it was it was it was red for his love red for his most recent films the company you keep I got it the company okie and that was Neal's book and Neal and I were pals back in the day I rented my first office from in Neil's apartment that was where I worked when I wrote don't say a word and we were good buddies and suddenly we just had a break and I guess the break was powered by politics but it wasn't over politics and we just never got back together again and one day he was gone and I was really sorry that I just never reached out to him and never amended that because you know you know what like it doesn't didn't matter whose fault it was it didn't really matter what it was about it was just you want to get it done the thing is I since you asked how to do it I would reach out through email because if they don't want to do it you can't do it I would reach out through you know at a distance and say here's where I am I'd like to get together you know you don't have to solve the problem you don't have to apologize you don't have to do anything just move on and let it go you know you can discuss it or not discuss it but move on and let it go I really recommend it because I you know death is this would be kind of final when it when it happens a lot of things that seem very big suddenly seem very small from Josiah Clavin come on I need some of that wisdom you often give I've fallen in love with a girl from Istanbul Turkey she calls herself a Muslim but has no understanding of Islam nor has she ever read a verse of the Koran she came to visit me here in the States and I got to share with her my relationship with Christ but I'm not sure it resonated she seemed excited about it I'm 30 she's awesome I want to marry her what the hell do I do Jews I the first thing I notice about this is that I don't have enough information to give you a good answer and the fact that I don't have enough information makes me a little weary like I don't know how you met her I don't know how long you spent with her I don't know how much time you've spent together or how you communicate and and when you then say I want to marry her I just makes me a little bit nervous you know I mean there are look can it can your love survive the cultural the first yak and your love overcome the cultural difference yes but do you know this girl I mean if you don't know whether your discussion about your religion resonated with her how long did you spend with her how much time if you add together so what I would say is look you have to get to know her and you have to get to know her close up I do not believe in love sweet song you know it's love sweet song made me get you started it's like an erotic explosion that goes off but you have to wait you know at least you have to know somebody for at least six months I think before that chemical you know imbalance goes away and you start to say like oh now I know who this is and I'm ready to decide whether to spend a life on with it with her so I would just make sure that you know or that you get to know her close up if you can bring her to America and have her you know put her up somewhere and just get to know her I would just go forward very slowly that is what I would say to you like I can't give you a perfect answer because I just don't feel like I have enough enough information but the fact that I don't have enough that information worries me in and of itself from Mackenzie how do we know that God is not just a wish fulfillment good question and I let me see it you know here's what I would have to say I think the question implies a mistaken idea of what faith is I think especially in America today when we talk about faith we're talking about this stupid belief in something that you just want to believe in so that would be wish fulfillment that's not what faith is at all that is not what faith is supposed to be a metaphor for faith that I would use I used to fly planes and in planes there's a thing called Bernoulli's formula I can't remember the name Bernoulli's form but it's a formula that that tells you how to create lift on a wing how to make a wing go up because they used to think that they would fly by imitating birds then they realized that wasn't gonna work Bernoulli's formula helped them take off to create enough lift to fly if you had that formula and no one had ever flown before but you did the formula and you tested it and you tested it again and you did the science and you realize that you could get this thing to fly it would be an act of faith to get into the first plane and send it off a cliff or send it down the runway that would be an act of faith because you had proved to yourself that it was reasonable and right and proper and almost unavoidable that this thing would fly but you did the act of faith by risking your life you know in a plane that's an act of faith to just jump off a cliff and say if I bet if I flap my arms like the Eagles I'll fly that's wish fulfillment and you're gonna get crushed okay people have to actually done that and it doesn't work it doesn't turn out that well so if you look of faith that way that you study the ideas about God the real proofs of God the things that Quine is said just the idea that you're absolutely certain one of the things that convinced me was I became absolutely certain that they were such a thing as right and wrong that it was a bad thing to torture a child even if everybody on earth was a child torturer it would still be bad it would still be a bad thing was an absolute objective bad that couldn't exist without God the reason was there first before I said okay now I'm gonna take the step of faith and believe that the reason is true believe that Bernoulli's formula works believed that the reasons for God the logical fact that God must really exist once you think about it once you study it once you examine it I'm going to trust my life to that and unlike Bernoulli's formula you can always go back you know one of the things that I swore to myself was I was going to plunk for faith but if I became unrealistic if my view of life suddenly betrayed me if I suddenly thought life was a song and everything was great and I was walking around with a happy face all the time like an idiot I would say you know what this has been a mistake that's not what happened it actually made me more realistic for the simple reason that there actually is a God and the one other thing I'll I'll offer is CS Lewis's point which is not a proof of God but it is Lewis makes the point is there's nothing on earth that we desire that doesn't exist we desire food there's food we desire sex there's sex we desire money fame all these things actually exist we are not built to desire or even to imagine things that don't exist so if you have a wish for God it's a good reason to suspect that God may be able to fulfill that let's see all right I have a live question before I get to the live question I just have one more that I'll do that came in from Andrew how would you define a real man thanks and you should know that you have been and always will be far more insightful than Michael Knowles I think I think that's an important point we have to get through on this that if you if you would you know I keep forgetting to ask because I you know it's just not the kind of thing I do but if you go on iTunes and leave a good review and you leave a like for our show it actually moves our show up in the ratings so that we can humiliate Michael Knowles because he's he's really good at that because all his audience is 12 years old so they know to do that but we are more mature and intelligent so we don't do that here so how do i define a real man I define a real man courage and integrity that is what I think a real man and these are things that can be attractive in women but they don't define women I had to find a man as somebody who is what he says he is who does what he says he will do and who appears to be what in fact is the truth about him and who has the courage to do that even when it becomes uncomfortable I think that is what a man is you know I think that it's it's not about you know fighting it's not about you know being stronger and bigger than other people there apply know plenty of real men who would lose a fight that fist fight if they got in them but they are absolutely stalwart and fearless in presenting themselves honestly and doing what they say they will do and not being moved off their spot when they know they're in the right and that is what I think is the essence of man what's the live question what would be your suggestion to an individual who has made a huge mistake in their life that keeps coming back how should one stay positive and move forward why that is a really tough question you know here's the thing you know God God's forgiveness is bigger than your sin that's the first thing so you're gonna have to learn that it you know you've made this you've made this mistake you can't go back into the past and fix it you got to own up to it you've got to go for the responsibility a lot of times when people ask this question they haven't done that you know they want that what they want is they want the thing to go away it's not gonna go away you got to take care of it you got to own up for it you got to live live for it you can't kill a man and then say how can I feel better about this no you got to go in you got to turn yourself in that's the that's the way it is so if you have done something that is that's continually haunting you do the best you can to be responsible for the consequences of your mistake then then you can you know freaky start to forgive yourself and not rake yourself over the coals and move forward I mean that's the only thing that you can do is take responsibility for the for the results of your of your action that's really the only thing you can do all right time for tickety-boo news so you know I want to get back to the idea of Donald Trump because I said something yesterday that I actually stopped for a minute I talked about Trump just dismissing the racial narrative the narrative that has been the absolute web in which the mainstream media and the Democrat Party which is but I repeat myself there that both the same thing has wrapped up the Republicans so that they are afraid to talk afraid to move afraid to gesture and the narrative is basically if you are not accepting left-wing premises and left-wing possibilities and left-wing language if you are not accepting those things in the way that the left-wing says you should address problems you are a racist and being a racist in America with its history of racism that's true history of racism is one of the worst things you can call a person it's a terrible terrible thing to call a person I would never call a person racist unless they were actually being racist and accepting racist premises whereas for instance you get this stuff from John Blake at CNN where he basically says we're all racist by default if you supported Donald Trump you're a racist it's not so much the people who are the white supremacists you know angry violent guys it's easy to focus he says on the angry white men and paramilitary gear who looked like they were mobilizing for a race war in the Virginia college town but it's the ordinary people the voters who elected a reality TV star with a record of making racially insensitive comments and that's the key thing he defines what is racially insensitive so everybody for instance when Trump went after Obama on that ridiculous birther thing and it was ridiculous they also that was racist I didn't think was racist at all I mean Obama was not like one of us he was not like their typical American who loves his country who thinks is a great country was grateful to be here thankful to be here he was he had all these weird anti colonial leftist ideas and so people felt he was not like us you know that was what spurred that it had nothing to do with the color of his skin if it had we wouldn't have elected him twice you know this and many of the people who voted for him voted for Donald Trump the next time out so Trump has shattered this and you know it's funny it only occurred to me this morning that I wrote a whole book about this I wrote a book called true crime which is an a thriller novel which was made into a film with Clint Eastwood and when they wrote the film and Eastwood taught it talked to me about this and the writer who wrote the film talked to me about it they changed the defendant in the case it's about a guy on death row and is you innocent or is he guilty and in the book he's a he's a white guy he's a white guy and they changed him to a black guy which made the entire moral essence of the film disappear you know the entire moral essence because the idea of the story is the star of the stories a reporter named Steve Everett who Clint plays who's a jerk he cheats on his wife he doesn't pay attention that stuff we were talking about before about balancing work and home he doesn't do any of those he's nasty he says ugly things but he's the only guy who can get at the truth because he won't be stopped by the PC narrative in order to bust through the to the truth you have to be nasty enough to bust the PC narrative Steve Everett is Donald Trump I suddenly realized when I woke up that I was telling that story because Donald Trump has a lot of things about him that I don't like I sometimes he's nasty sometimes he's bullying sometimes he uses language I don't like but he is the only guy and this is why people like John Nolte and everyone loved him so much he's the only guy who has burst through this narrative that if we say it this way it's not right if I say it if I talk about Charlottesville in this way then I'm a racist and anybody who says he's not a racist is is a racist himself and anybody who doesn't run for the hills and grovel before the press and say please please forgive us for even thinking looking Donald Trump all he was talking about charlottesville is in fact a racist and all of this stuff he is breaking through this narrative that has put a stranglehold on our conversation on the relationships between us as Americans and and our politics so that they are controlling even like the things people think or are willing to say and you know it's interesting the the other day in the Philadelphia Inquirer there was an article by Amy Wax who is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Larry Alexander who is a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law and it was called paying the price for breakdown of the country's bourgeois culture and this is how what it says very briefly says too few Americans are qualified for the jobs available male working-age labor force participation is at depression-era lows opioid abuse is widespread homicidal violence plagues inner cities almost half of all children are born out of wedlock and even more are raised by single mothers many college students lack basic skills and high school students rank below those from two dozen other countries the causes of these phenomena are multiple and complex but implicated in these and other maladies is the breakdown of the country's bourgeois culture that culture laid out the script we all were supposed to follow get married before you have children strive to stay married for the children's sake get the education you need for gainful employment work hard and avoid idleness go to the extra mile for your employer or client be a patriot ready to serve the country be neighborly civic minded and charitable avoid coarse language in public be respectful of authority Ashu substance abuse and crime these basic cultural precepts rained from the late 1940s to the mid 1960s they could be followed by people of all backgrounds and abilities especially when backed up by almost Universal endorsement and here ins was a major contributor to the productivity educational gains and social coherence of that period so of course what happened suddenly these guys are under attack thesis this is toxic the Students Union at Penn says this is toxic racist sexist homophobic moment superiority of one race over others is not an academic debate we have in the 21st century the kind of hate wax espouses is an everyday part of many students lives at Penn the ideal counsel representing they say marginalize graduate students of the University of Pennsylvania called for them to be silenced we want we demand of course they always have a demand with a statement from the university specifically designating racist homophobic sexist transphobic speech as hate speech and censoring and censoring it okay so in other words they have now created this narrative where to call for people to act responsibly like bourgeois people is racist because somehow this is not black culture this is not black culture you know that you get married you know before you have a baby that you get an education that you respect authority so they've shut that whole thing down Jason Riley is in The Wall Street Journal and he is a he's at the Manhattan Institute so he's a colleague because I'm a write for City Journal at the Manhattan Institute and I should I should mention he's a black guy and he writes a lot about race he writes this between he says that he's talking about the fact that the left is pushing this narrative that dysfunction in black communities traces back to slavery and so it always has to be solved by somehow recompence een black people for slavery and for bigotry and Jim Crow but he says this between 1890 when slavery is eliminated right and nineteen forty black marriage rates in the US were higher than white marriage rates in the 1940s and 50s black labor participation rates exceeded those of whites black incomes grew much faster than white in Crump incomes and the black poverty rate fell by 40 percentage points between 1940 and 1970s as is during Jim Crow and prior to the era of affirmative action the number of blacks and middle class professions quadrupled in other words racial gaps were narrowing steady progress was being made blacks today hear plenty about what they can achieve due to the legacy of slavery and not enough about what they did in fact achieve notwithstanding hundreds of years in bondage followed by decades of legal separation in the post 60s era these passe of trends would slow stall or in some cases even reverse course the homicide rate for black men fell by eighteen percent in the 1940s and another twenty two percent in the 1950s but in the 1960s all of those gains would vanish as the homicide rate for black males rose by nearly 90 percent our today's black violent crime rates a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow or of something else well obviously they are a legacy of the 60s of the Great Society of the liberal policies that have been imposed on these peoples you can see it in every Democrat city where our citizens our neighbors who are black are suffering under these policies these this narrative this racial narrative that this scurrilous press has imposed on our conversation and the scurrilous left which the press is the mouthpiece of is destroying our people it's destroying our people Trump Donald Trump is not always a good person he's not always a good man he doesn't always do the right thing but if he destroys this narrative like a bull in a china shop he will be doing God's work and he will be doing more for this country than the left has ever done to further that argument we're gonna have the late John Nolte on Tamar John Nolte who has left the family never leave the family John he has left the Daily wire and gone back to Breitbart because he feels they are more of a warrior sight and he's a great writer and a good friend and I'm really sorry he left and I'm going to run in ragged Tok be there for that I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show you
