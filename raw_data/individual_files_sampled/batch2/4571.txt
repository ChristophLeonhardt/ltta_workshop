I have said from the beginning that these are very serious allegations and she deserves to be heard she's like these allegations are credible are they disqualifying I cannot make that determination I should not make that determination that would be like the questions that were asked of judge Kavanagh when he was testifying all right those were republican senator Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski moments ago about the sex assault allegations that are made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh right now Cavanaugh is at the White House for a second day as allies try to bolster his character and trotting up some time warned responses to the accusation I remind you Murkowski and Collins called for Al Franken to step down and he didn't have due process supporters of Cavanaugh are calling into question professor Christine Blasi Ford's memory of the alleged assault along with a 36 years that passed between then and now but these methods of discrediting a woman's accusation against a man especially one with significant political social or financial power are nothing new to sex crimes investigators by joining us now is Doug wig Dory's a former prosecutor who now represents sexual harassment and assault survivors Doug we're a few days into this now so we can we can sort of dig into some of the specifics the professor Ford has said she can't remember a lot of the details now I think it's fair to say that most of us don't remember a lot of details but that is something that people who are critical of her used to attack her credibility I mean that that's that's correct I mean it's not uncommon for somebody to who's been sexually assaulted first of all not to come out immediately we all know that the Miche movement has really shed some light on that what's interesting actually senator hatch actually yesterday said in a conversation with judge Kavanagh that Judge Cavanaugh actually remembers that he wasn't at the party right you know I just had my 50th birthday over the weekend and I was thinking it back to 1980s I can't recall which parties I went to that's for sure but there are a lot of facts that substantiate professor Ford's claims so we have on the one hand we have her passing a lie-detector polygraph test she has excellent counsel who is well thought of she came in 2012 she presented this to her psychologist before Judge Cavanaugh was a Supreme Court nominee she put somebody in the room if she was going to make this up but she put another person in right he's a graben Iowa yeah but also interestingly in his book and in the yearbook and you know paints a very disturbing picture of the environment that was going on there she mean judges your book page where he says that women should be gone occasionally yes I mean and the drinking that was going on I mean so there's some serious things that actually are in her favor but on the flip side in judge Cavanaugh's defense there are some things that are in his favor as well I mean usually in these types of cases these are not one offs now the hearings Monday maybe other people would come out we don't know yet but as far as we know there are no other woman who have had protests that are said anything negative about judge Kavanaugh and one thing that sticks out in my mind in particular is I was a former law clerk law clerks are very close to their judges they do it out of law school for about a year or two years they get to know their judge very well he had a lot of woman who were law clerks none of them have said said anything so those are the sorts of things that are in his column but Monday's going to be fascinating TV I think a lot of people are going to be home and and take off from work to watch it do you think Monday is a good idea do you think the public hearings are a good idea because I need a hill wrote a piece saying hold on a second they don't have any better systems than they had back then if you think about what she went through personally professionally I mean brutal I've given that a lot of thought I'm not sure Monday's gonna happen I mean a lot could happen between now and Monday well I mean other things could come out maybe somebody who was at that party says you know hold on a second judge Kavanagh was there and that sort of refutes what he said apparently to senator hatch another woman could come forward judge Kavanagh could decide this spectacle actually is not in the best interests of my family and I want to go back to the NZ Circuit with my reputation intact but there is no perfect system when somebody accuses someone of sexual assault their credibility is important so difficult questions will no doubt be asked of Professor Ford and there will be difficult questions to ask of judge Kavanagh which will for interesting viewing for people to assess credibility but it is not a trial I mean the Senate's role here pursuant to the Constitution is to provide this to advise it's that right not to determine guilt or innocence exactly but the but if if there is a feel I mean I've seen people say that even if it's true he should be confirmed I certainly don't agree with where the rubber hits the road that I keep hearing things are so different so much has changed since the 1990s but sadly I don't see that I see that the me2 movement exists but if this is a repeat of what happened to Anita Hill look at Twitter and look how Professor Ford is getting attacked her character assassinated right now things actually don't seem different at all if you look at the Republicans that are on the Judiciary Committee it is a lineup of white guys over the age of 50 this is a president who voluntarily a year ago remember when he spoke to the New York Times said Bill O'Reilly he should take those women who accused him of harassment to court I know he's such a good guy I mean he actually said they weren't even telling the truth before you even met or spoke to these women and so how can we think things are so different from the 90s this is what I think what I think is different I mean of course there are fringe people on both the right and the left we're gonna say crazy things on Twitter and social media that's unfortunate of course but I think I think most people today who are watching this you know that 90% of the people maybe 85% of the people view sexual assault allegations very differently I think the attitudes have changed where if a woman comes forward and said said that something happened 30 something years ago it's not automatically dismissed as she should have come forward back in the 1980s therefore if she didn't come forward she should she should not have her day in court or her day here because people know people have been educated to know that sexual assault victims don't always come forward a lot of them don't come forward for decades because they don't want to bring those things for they don't want their credibility attack there's a whole host of reasons why I think that has changed and I think I do think even though the they are white men Republicans that they will treat the victim differently I believe they will you know aren't hacks I did yesterday I and I think that that will come back to haunt him I think what might come back to haunt judge Cavanaugh again is this thing that he wasn't even at a party how does he know that yeah that makes no sense a that sort of somewhere in a ten year period he wasn't at any parties ever at anybody's house yeah and and will will judge - I'll submit to a lie-detector test now they're not admissible in court of course but this is not court we know that various agencies use polygraphs and lie detector tests maybe he'll agree or disagree to submit someone as well hey MSNBC fans thanks
