GOING TO TRY TO EXPLAIN IT. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. WE ARE NOT OVERSTATING IT. FIRST, KANYE WEST SPOKE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND DREW NEWS COVERAGE FOR WHAT HE SAID. COMMENTATORS WERE NOT IMPRESS AND MANY DISMISSED IT AS A SIDE SHOW. IN SOME WAYS THEY WERE RIGHT. HE MADE A NUMBER OF INTERESTING POINTS BUT IN THE END HE IS AN ENTERTAINER. DONALD TRUMP WAS THERE, TOO. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD. LIKE THE REST OF US ULTIMATELY HE IS PASSING THROUGH. THERE WILL BE OTHER PRESIDENTS. THE QUESTION TO CARE ABOUT IS BIGGER THAN TWO PEOPLE. IS AMERICA STILL A FREE COUNTRY? CAN PEOPLE OPENLY EXPRESS BELIEFS IN PUBLIC? ARE THEY STILL ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT THEY THINK IS TRUE WITHOUT BEING PUNISHED FOR IT? THAT IS WHAT MATTERS MOST AND MATTERS MORE THAN ANY SINGLE POLITICIAN OR RAPPER OR MIDTERM ELECTION. BY THAT STANDARD THE ONE THAT MATTERS WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE TELLS US A LOT ABOUT AMERICA RIGHT NOW. MUCH OF IT OMINOUS. IF YOU MISSED IT, HERE IS PART OF WHAT KANYE WEST SAID. PEOPLE EXPECT IF YOU ARE BLACK YOU HAVE TO BE DEMOCRAT. I HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT WELFARE IS WHY BLACK PEOPLE ARE DEMOCRATS. FIRST, LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF JOBS. SO THE FATHERS LOSE JOB AND WE WILL GIVE YOU MORE FOR HAVING MORE KIDS IN YOUR HOME. Tucker: TO SUM UP, KANYE WEST SAYS THAT THE LIBERAL SOCIAL PROGRAMS UNDERMUNE THE BLACK FAMILY. HE NOTES THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS FACE ENORMOUS PRESSURE NOT TO SUPPORT REPUBLICANS. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFTEN DISPLAYS UNDISGUISED CONTEMPT FOR MEN AND MASCULINITY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,ITE KNOWS ESPECIALLY CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY TRUE FOR ONE THING. IF YOU PAY ANY ATTENTION AT ALL YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT. WHAT WEST SAID IS HARD TO REBUT FACTUALLY THAT NOBODY TRIED TO DO THAT. INSTEAD THEY ATTACKED HIM AS A PERSON. ATTACKED HIS DECENCY AND HIS MENTAL CONDITION. IF THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR, IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS NOW A UNIVERSAL TACTIC ON THE LEFT. THEY DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH YOU. THEY WANT TO DENOUNCE YOU. WATCH THIS CNN DEEP CRITIQUE OF TRUMP'S DOMESTIC PROGRAM. WHY DOESN'T PRESIDENT TRUMP CONDEMN RACISM? HIS OWN WORDS AND ACTION TELL YOU WHY. HE IS RACIST. LET ME NOT MINCE WORDS. THIS PRESIDENT TRAFFICS IN RACIST. ROSEANN'S TWEET WAS RACIST BUT HE FAILED TO CONDEMN IT. WHY? HE CAN'T. HIS OWN WORDS AND ACTIONS ARE RACIST, TOO. WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, THAT HE IS NOT EMBOLDENING RACISTS AND RACISM. Tucker: THE BEST THING ABOUT THE ARGUMENT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN ANYTHING. MASTER ANY DETAILS BECAUSE FACTS ARE IRRELEVANT. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS MY OPPONENTS ARE BAD PEOPLE. YOU MUST IGNORE THEM. SO IT WASN'T OBVIOUS HOW THE LEFT WAS GOING TO PULL ANY OF THIS ALL WITH KANYE WEST. THEY ATTACKED HIM AS CRAZY AT FIRST BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. IF YOU THINK THAT KANYE WEST IS MENTALLY HILL WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING HIM FOR THAT? YOU CAN'T CALL HIM RACE U.S. BECAUSE HE IS BLACK RACIST BECAUSE HE IS BLACK. BUT THEN THEY CRACK THE CODE. YOU MUST IGNORE KANYE WEST, HE EXPLAINS TO THE REST OF US BECAUSE HE IS A TRAITOR TO HIS RACE. WATCH THIS. WHAT I SAW WAS A MENTAL SHOW TODAY. HIM IN FRONT OF THE WHITE PEOPLE, MOSTLY WHITE PEOPLE EMBARRASSING HIMSELF. EMBARRASSING AMERICANS BUT MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS THE PERSON WHO REPRESENTS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY? HE DOESN'T. THIS WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT. HIS MOTHER IS ROLLING OVER IN HER GRAVE. Tucker: THERE YOU GO. THAT HIS SKIN COLOR MEANS HE IS REQUIRED TO BEHAVE IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY. IF HE CHOOSES TO BEHAVE IN ANY OTHER WAY HE SHOULD BE PUNISHED. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DON LEMON, HIS RACE IS HIS DESTINY AND IT DEFINES EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM. PEOPLE USED TO TALK LIKE THIS 50 YEARS AGO AS THEY DEFENDED RACIAL SEGREGATION OF THE AMERICAN SOUTH. WHAT A SURPRISE TO LEARN THEY ARE STILL TALKING THAT WAY. THIS TIME IT'S ON CNN. MICHAEL ERIC DIESON WENT EVEN FURTHER. FOR THE CRIME OF BEING FRIENDLY WITH A POLITICIAN HE DOESN'T LIKE, HE SAYS KANYE WEST IS ACTUALLY DESPITE ALL APPEARANCES A PRACTICING WHY WHY WHITE SUPREMACIST. WE SHOULD SAY KANYE AS AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE CANNOT STAND IDLY BY WHY YOU GIVE COVER TO A MAN WHO IS A WHITE SUPREMACIST. THIS IS WHITE SUPREMACIST BY VENTRILOQUISM. WHITE RACIST IDEALS FLOWING FROM KANYE WEST'S MOUTH. Tucker: KEEP IN MIND THEY ARE CALLING WEST THE CRAZY ONE. THEY DON'T MEAN IT. THEY WOULDN'T BE SO ANGRY IF THEY DID MEAN IT. THE REAL FEAR IS THAT WEST ISN'T CRAZY AT A AND YOU MIGHT LISTEN TO HIM. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WEST OR TRUMP. THIS IS ABOUT POWER. MOST THINGS ARE. SUDDENLY A SMALL NUMBER OF THE IDEOLOGICAL GATEKEEPERS CONTROL WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY IS ALLOWED TO SAY AND THINK. THE PEOPLE WORK AT GOOGLE, CNN, IN THE U.S. SENATE AND MAYBE DOWN THE HALL FROM THE OFFICE. IN THE CORPORATE SENSITIVITY DEPARTMENT. THEY ARE ENJOYING THE POWER THEY HAVE BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS ENJOY HAVING POWER. BUT THEY ARE WORRIED. THEY CAN KNOW THEY CAN ONLY MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM, THE ONE THEY BENEFIT FROM THROUGH FEAR AND LYING. IF ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DECIDE TO IGNORE THE RULES AND THINK FOR THEMSELVES THIS IS OVER. THEY HAVE NO MORE POWER. WHOLE COUNTRY OF PEOPLE SAYING WHAT THEY THINK IS TRUE. THAT IS THE NIGHTMARE AND WHAT THEY FEAR THE MOST. I COULD START WITH A SINGLE PERSON. WRAPPER SPEAKING STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE OVAL OFFICE ONE AFTERNOON. FROM THERE, WHO KNOWS WHERE IT COULD GO? OTHER PEOPLE COULD STOP HIDING THE UNAPPROVED OPINIONS. THIS IS A TERRIFYING PROSPECT. FREE SPEECH IS LIKE A VIRUS. BETTER TO STOP IT WHILE YOU CAN. DON LEMON IS NO GENIUS BUT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT. MURDOCH IS A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR AT NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE AND JOINS US TONIGHT. WHAT ARE THEY REALLY SAYING ABOUT KANYE WEST? A COUPLE OF THINGS. UNLIKE BACK IN THE 1960s IN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT YOU MAY RECALL A NUMBER OF PROTESTERS HOLDING UP THE SIGNS SAYING, "I AM A MAN." HE IS NOT ABLE TO SAY THAT. HE SAYS I AM NOT A MAN, I AM NOT ALLOWED TO THINK ON MY OWN. I MUST DO WHAT THE LOCAL ORTHODOXY SAYS. SO HE DIDN'T DO THAT SO THEY ARE DENOUNCED HIM AS A NEGRO. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY. YOU COME ON EVERY NIGHT AND PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE WRONG BUT NOBODY SAYS YOU ARE A BAD WHITE PERSON. Tucker: RIGHT. THEY DISAGREE WITH YOUR VIEWS BUT THEY THEY HEART ATTACK AIM AS A HUMAN BEING AND TRY TO REMOVE HIS BLACKNESS FROM HIM. IT'S DISGUSTING. Tucker: THEY ARE NOT EVEN TREATING HIM AS A HUMAN. THEY ARE TREATING HIM AS INTERCHANGEABLE PIECE OF A LARGER WHOLE. LIKE A FACENESS DRONE WHO HAS TO OBEY. HE HAS FALLEN OUT OF LINE. THEY CAN'T HAVE THAT. THE FEAR IS PEOPLE LISTEN AND ASK QUESTIONS ISN'T IT INTERESTING TO HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT BROUGHT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT TO LOWEST LEVEL OF HISTORY. GROWING TWICE WHERE IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. SUDDENLY THE BLACK FOLKS THINK MAYBE HE IS WORKING OUT AND THE POLICIES AREN'T RACIST ATTACK WE HEARD ABOUT THEY MIGHT TO VOTE THAT WAY. DEMOCRATS WILL BE IN BUG TROUBLE. IT WILL BE IN BIG TROUBLE. SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEHUMANIZE HIM WHICH IS WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING TONIGHT. Tucker: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? AM I MISREMEMBERING? I DON'T REMEMBER PEOPLE TERMS THAT ARE UGLY AND I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THEM. PEOPLE DIDN'T USED TO TALK LIKE THAT IN TELEVISION UNTIL RECENTLY. NOT SO MUCH. NOT TO THIS LEVEL. UNIFORMLY AND CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ANY NUMBER OF THE CABLE CHANNELS, THE VARIOUS PEOPLE COMING OUT. THE PROFESSOR DYSON FROM MY ALMA MATER SAYING THE THINGS THAT HE IS THAT KANYE IS A WHITE PREM SUPREMACIST AND VENTRILOQUIST AND TRUMP IS PULLING HIS STRINGS. IF TRUMP WERE A WHITE SUPREMACIST WHY WOULD WE HAVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLACK ARTISTS IN THE OVAL OFFICE? IT MAKES NO SENSE. IT'S NOT LOGICAL. THIS SHOWS THE TREMENDOUS DESPERATION OF WHICH THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT FIND ITSELF TODAY. Tucker: IT'S INTERESTING THE LEVEL OF BULLYING THAT GOES ON. IF THEY THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY, THEY ARE SAYING HE IS CRAZY AND IT'S OKAY NOW TO MOCK PEOPLE'S MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT IF THEY THOUGHT HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND THEY WOULD SMILE INDULGENTLY LIKE YOU DO WITH THE GUY EATING IMAGINARY INSECTS ON THE BUS. RIGHT? RIGHT. HE TALKED ABOUT JOB CREATION AND IMPROVING THE ECONOMY AND THE CRIME DISASTER IN CHICAGO. HE TALKED ABOUT THE MONTESSORI SCHOOLS. HE HAD SOLID THINGS TO SAY IN THERE. HE MADE A POINT WHERE IS IT WRITTEN IF YOU ARE BLACK YOU HAVE TO BE A DEMOCRAT? HE IS BREAKING AWAY FROM THE NOTION. IF ENOUGH BLACKS BREAK AWAY FROM THAT NOTION THE DEMOCRATS WILL BE IN BAD STATE BECAUSE BLACKS ARE A LARGE PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC BASE. IF EIGHT OUT OF TEN BLACK FOLKS STAYED DEMOCRAT AND TWO OUT OF TEN VOTE REPUBLICANS THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BE LIKE THE WHIG PARDON AND THEY WOULD BE GONE. Tucker: YOU HAVE OPINIONS AND I CERTAINLY HAVE THEM ON FULL DISPLAY. WOULDN'T YOUR CONSCIENCE ACHE A LITTLE IF YOU FOUND YOURSELF NIGHT AFTER NIGHT REPEATING NASTIEST TALKING POINT ON BEHALF OF A POLITICAL PARTY AND PRETENDING YOU WERE A JOURNALIST. WOULD YOU DO THAT? I PRESENT OPINIONS AND I TRY TO BACK THEM UP WITH THE FACTS AND THE FIGURES AND THE QUOTES AND EVIDENCE. THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING THAT. THEY SCREAM TRUMP IS A RACIST. A RACIST, A RACIST. WHERE IS THE PROOF? IF HE WERE RACIST WHY DID HE CAMPAIGN IN HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND WELCOME THEM WITH AN OFFICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO ASSIST THEM? HE MADE M.L.K. BIRTHPLACE NATIONAL HISTORICAL MONUMENT. OBAMA COULD HAVE DONE THAT. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID THAT. IT'S NOT BEHAVIOR TO SEE OUT OF A WHITE SUPREMACIST. Tucker: THEY ARE SAYING WHAT THEY THINK THEY HAVE TO. THIS IS REMARKABLE THE HACKS THEY ARE. AND CRUEL. Tucker: I'M AGREE. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT KANYE WEST BUT IT'S MEAN. TOO MEAN.
