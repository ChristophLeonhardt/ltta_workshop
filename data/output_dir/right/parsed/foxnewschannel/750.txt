CONFERENCE ON CAPITOL HILL TO
INSIST THAT SHE NEVER CALLED FOR
ANY VIOLENCE.
>> TRUMP IS THE ONE WHO IS
CREATING THE LIES, TRYING TO
HAVE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT I
TALKED ABOUT HARMING PEOPLE.
THERE IS NOWHERE IN MY
STATEMENT, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE,
STENTS DOWN THE CONSENTS.
BUT PROTEST INSTABILITY.
PROTEST IS ABOUT PEACEFUL

FROM THIS PRESIDENT.

IF SHE STARTS TO FEEL THE HEAT
A DEEP FAR, THAT'S HOW YOU FIX
THESE THINGS.
