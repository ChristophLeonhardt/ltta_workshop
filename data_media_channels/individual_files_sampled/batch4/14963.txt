I think the two keys that I took out of the Alberta budget was that they have no compunction about making numbers up we knew that but this is the most made up budget yet for instance they believe they think they can convince us to believe that they will only raise spending in the coming year by two hundred million dollars well they've been in office less than three years they've already raised spending in by eight billion dollars they've been going at a rate of about 5.2 percent a year and now they think that they can just say well we'll only raise spending by 0.4% and and the rest of us will buy that the proof that they're not serious about that is that next year after the election is over when they think they might be able to win again they intend to raise spending by 1.7 billion so I just made up numbers right the NDP you're absolutely right I think they've convinced themselves that then they have no chance of winning the 2019 provincial election but they have any chance they have is based on two things proving that they're tough on pipelines improving that they're tough on the finance so this is this is attempt number one this is a trying to improve they're trying to prove they're tough on finances they are not and the other big number that we got so there's this ridiculous two hundred million dollars in in spending increases that that they're hopefully the other thing that they the other big number was that they admitted finally that if they stick around until 2023 that's when the first but to balance the budget and by that time they will have run up ninety six billion dollars in debt yeah yeah and it's it's just shocking I mean that number it it's it would be triple that would have tripled the debt under their tail am i right oh yeah more than triple what way more than trouble I mean when they came in even after Redford Estelle Mack who you know we're spendthrift enough as old Tories the debt wasn't twenty billion now it'll be 96 it's almost a five-fold increase that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
