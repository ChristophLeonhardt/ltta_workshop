when I started out doing the studying the influence process partially that was out of self-defense I found that I was an easy pushover for the appeals of various kinds of sales operators or fundraisers who would come to my door I would buy things I didn't really want I would subscribe to magazine subscriptions I didn't want I contribute to causes I'd never heard of and I wondered well what was going on there how could it be that I would say yes to something that on its merits I didn't want it must have been the way that thing was presented to me that made me say yes so here's what I've learned to do when I encounter my myself feeling doubtful about whether I should do this or not whether I should say yes or not whether I should purchase this thing or not I take a half step back from the situation and I try to separate the thing from the way that thing was presented to me and then make my decision solely on the basis of the merits of the thing not the presentation of the thing itself and that's worked well
