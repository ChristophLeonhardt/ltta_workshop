1
00:00:00,615 --> 00:00:02,549
OR DRAMA IS NEARING ABOUT.

4
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:06,487

FORWARD THIS CONFIRMATION VOTE,

10
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:18,465

11
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:19,166
>> THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER

12
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,300
MITCH McCONNELL INITIATED A

13
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:20,801
FOUR-DAY PROCESS.

14
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:22,069
HE'S REPEATEDLY SAID HE WANTS TO

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,904
HAVE THE CONFIRMATION VOTE THIS

00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:25,272
WEEK.

17
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:26,340
SO WE HAD TO INITIATE THIS

18
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,474
PROCESS TONIGHT BEFORE MIDNIGHT

19
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:29,910
AND WHAT HE DID HERE ON

20
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,079
CAPITOL HILL IS FILING AN EFFORT

21
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
TO LIMIT DEBATE.

22
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,281
HE FILED THAT TONIGHT BURIED BY

23
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:37,051
SENATE RULE, THAT NEEDS A DAY TO

24
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:38,318
LAY OVER SO TOMORROW IT LAYS

25
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,354
DORMANT AND THAT IT RIPENS LIKE

26
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,122
A FRUIT ON FRIDAY.

27
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:44,124
THAT MEANS IT'S AVAILABLE FOR A

28
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:44,458
VOTE.

29
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:45,726
THAT'S THE PROCEDURAL VOTE TO

30
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:46,193
CUT OFF DEBATE.

31
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,796
IN THESE 51.

32
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:51,098

33
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,600
WHEN THEY WERE DEALING WITH

34
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:54,868
NEIL GORSUCH MITCH McCONNELL

35
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,670
LOWERED THE BAR TO END

36
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:57,104
FILIBUSTERS.

37
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,506
IT USED TO BE 60, IT'S NOW DOWN

38
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:01,308

39
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,510
ON DAY THREE, FRIDAY, VOTED TO

40
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,112

00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:06,847
CLOCK BEGINS TO RUN.

42
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:09,650
THAT'S ALL THE TIME THAT THE

00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:11,151
THE NOMINATION CAN CONSUME UNTIL

45
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:14,288
IT CULMINATES IN A CONFIRMATION

00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,290
VOTE PROBABLY ON SATURDAY, 30

47
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,057
HOURS THEREAFTER.

48
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:18,792
THE SENATE RULE SAYS YOU VOTE ON

49
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:22,663
IT ONE AFTER YOU COME IN SO IT'S

50
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:24,665
POSSIBLE THEY COULD HAVE COME IN

51
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,899

52
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,637

ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

57
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:35,375
WHERE DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHERE

58
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,511
THEY STAND WITH VOTES ON EITHER

59
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:37,978
SIDE NOW?

60
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,280
>> IS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT THE MATH.

61
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:41,882
YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THAT MANY

62
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:43,484
TIMES BEFORE.

63
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:44,118
LOOK AT THE TRIO.

64
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:46,120
MITCH McCONNELL IS TO KEEP THE

65
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,221
TRIO OF JEFF FLAKE, LISA

66
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:48,489
MURKOWSKI, SUSAN COLLINS

67
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:48,856
TOGETHER.

68
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:50,157
IF HE KEEPS THEM TOGETHER HE

69
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:51,692
GETS TO 51.

70
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:52,860
IF HE LOSES ONE OF THOSE THREE

71
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,062
HE'S RIGHT AT 50 AND MIKE PENCE,

72
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:56,096
THE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD BREAK

73
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:56,897
THE TIE.

74
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,298
WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATS?

75
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,199
IT'S GENERALLY NOT BOUGHT THAT

76
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,534
ANY DEMOCRAT WOULD VOTE TO

77
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,102
CONFIRM BRETT KAVANAUGH UNLESS

78
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:03,670
REPUBLICANS CAN DELIVER THE

79
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:04,505
GOODS.

80
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:06,306
THEY CARRY IT AND GET THEM

81
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,508
ACROSS 51.

82
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,976
I TALKED EARLIER WITH JOE

83
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:09,743

84
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:10,544
WEST VIRGINIA, HE IS IN PLAY.

85
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:11,712
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY

86
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:14,381
ABOUT HIS BOAT.

87
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:15,115
>> I'M LOOKING AT THE GENTLEMAN

88
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:18,852
AS AN ADULT, 31 YEARS OF

89
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:19,419
PROFESSIONAL SERVICE.

90
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,089
I'M LOOKING AS A FATHER, AS A

91
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,323
PERSON IN A COMMUNITY, HOW HE

92
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:24,892
INTERACTS WITH HIS COMMUNITY.

93
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:25,659
I'M TRYING TO PUT THE HUMAN SIDE

94
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,561
TO IT.

95
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:28,896
>> SO JOE MANCHIN IS IN PLAY.

96
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:31,031
I WOULD ALSO LOOK AT HEIDI

97
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:32,666
HEITKAMP, DEMOCRAT FROM

98
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,667
NORTH DAKOTA.

99
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:34,701
THOSE OF THE TWO MAIN OPERATIVES

100
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:35,836
AND THE DEMOCRATS THAT MIGHT BE

101
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:38,405
IN PLAY TO VOTE FOR BRETT

102
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,173
KAVANAUGH.

103
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:39,806
>> Shannon: HOW TENSE ARE

104
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:40,941
THINGS ON CAPITOL HILL WITH ALL

105
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:41,441

00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,577
WITH HER QUITE A BIT BUT WHAT

107
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:44,711
YOU ARE EXPERIENCING THERE AND

00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:46,146
THE MEMBERS AS WELL.

109
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:48,815
>> IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY

110
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:49,249
SUPERCHARGED.

111
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,150
PROTESTERS IN THE HALLWAY.

112
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:52,019
EXPECTING MORE PROTESTERS

113
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,686
TOMORROW.

114
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:53,854
U.S. CAPITOL POLICE ESCORTING

115
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:54,721
SENATORS TO AND FROM THE CAPITAL

116
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,523
WHEN THEY HAD TO COME IN VOTE.

117
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,391
WE HAD A STORY BRICK TONIGHT

118
00:02:57,392 --> 00:03:01,061
WHERE AN UNPAID DEMOCRATIC

119
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:01,762
INTERN FOR SHEILA JACKSON LEE

120
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:03,263
HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY THE U.S.

121
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:06,200
CAPITOL POLICE FOR DIOXANE THREE

122
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:08,569
OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS ON

123
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,103
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

124
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:11,738
HE WAS CAUGHT IN A CAPITOL HILL

125
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:12,472
OFFICE LAST NIGHT AND ARRESTED

126
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:13,273
AT HOME BY THE U.S. CAPITOL

127
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:15,676
POLICE TODAY.

128
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:16,410
YOU HAD MITCH McCONNELL SAYING

129
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:16,977
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE

130
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:19,279
INTIMIDATED BY THESE PROTESTERS

131
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,681
HARASSING REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN

132
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:21,315
THE HALL AND THEN YOU HAD

133
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:23,016
CHUCK SCHUMER, THE MINORITY

134
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:23,951
LEADER BASICALLY GOING RIGHT UP

135
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:25,118
TO THE EDGE WHERE HE ALMOST

136
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,720
CALLED MITCH McCONNELL A LIAR.

137
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:28,322
HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO USE

138
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:30,290
THAT WORD, HE IS USING

139
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:30,857
FALSEHOODS, HE SAID.

140
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,226
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SORT OF

141
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:32,993
LANGUAGE ON CAPITOL HILL BETWEEN

142
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:35,295
THE TWO LEADERS VERY OFTEN.

143
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,663
THE REASON THIS NOMINATION IS

144
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:37,998
DANCING ON THE TIP OF A PEN, IT

145
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,466
COULD GO EITHER WAY WHEN YOU'RE

146
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:42,102
DEALING WITH 49, 50, 51 VOTES.

147
00:03:42,103 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO TENSE.
