a new federally funded study has scientists investigating a mystery of nature why does owning a gun change a person's name to Mohammed federally-funded scientists have long been aware that every time a shooting occurs in America the perpetrator uses a gun and they've therefore determined beyond a doubt that gun ownership causes people to become evil but recently these same scientists have noticed that many of the people who have been made evil by guns have also developed the name Mohammed or some other name associated with the Middle East they are now trying to discover why gun ownership would cause someone to have such a name federally-funded scientist professor clueless Vaughn quizzical told reporters quote we know that guns make people evil because we received over a billion dollars in federal grants to do a study called how guns make people evil if guns didn't make people evil then I wouldn't own this Mercedes and that just doesn't make any sense but why do all the gun made evil people suddenly develop middle-eastern names that's a mystery that could get me a Maserati unquote one quizzical went on to say that he was also hoping to find a link between guns and climate change because he said quote if you can't find a connection to climate change you are just leaving money on the table in a somber appearance after the latest incident of a gun turning a person's name Middle Eastern future former President Barack Obama said quote how long oh how long well the American people fail to live up to my admittedly unreachable standards of insight and wisdom when oh when will this sinful generation hear my message and understand that it is guns guns guns that make people evil and that also give them names like Achmed unquote presumptive Democratic nominee for dishonest president Hillary Clinton reacted to the new information telling reporters quote I have always said what I'm now saying which I've never said before and I completely deny it yet will continue to say it without fear or compromise until it's disproven when I will say something entirely different and pretend I've always said that unquote presumptive Republican nominee for outlandish president Donald Trump addressed the issue in a speech saying quote after a certain amount of solitary reflect and with all respect for my honorable colleagues it seems to me that their confusing correlation with causation and a guilty of the intellectual fallacy that I like to call by its latin name of cum hoc ergo propter hoc not to mention the similarly specious reasoning familiarly referred to as post hoc ergo propter hoc of course it's been a while since I studied computationally intensive statistical methods under Efron Trump went on but in my considered opinion it would be far more efficacious not to say laudatory to simply work ourselves up into an asterick afrien Z and hunt down random Muslim guys actually Trump has never said anything remotely that intelligent he just sounds that intelligent compared to Obama and Hillary trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show you know there's an old expression in the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king this is like in the country of the blind stupid and dishonest the stupid and dishonest one all right we're back subscribe so tomorrow is mail day remember my mail get me those questions I want to hear everything that everybody has to say so if you subscribe you can do that and you can also see us and if you can see the people howling for more Lindsey on online you know we're so you can become you become the Vanna White of commentary and point to dumb fuck also I'm getting a lot of people asking where Ben was and he was celebrating the Jewish holiday of Shavuot which is when God gave the law to the Jews on Mount Sinai I think he's gonna do a remote today so he will be back he'll be what yeah I think Shapiro was just making this stuff up at this point yeah I need a day off it's a it's hot man I got off the new witch when God gave the Jews olive oil this is all the Italians all right take the day off so William McGurn the great Bill McGurn who writes a column at The Wall Street Journal opens has come today quoting Voltaire and here's the quote from Voltaire I have never made but one to God a very short one Oh Lord make my enemies ridiculous and God granted it that it's the story of Donald Trump yesterday in the aftermath of this horrific murder as multiple murder in Orlando I mean we have Adam Bandler our own Adam Bandler on The Daily wire has a piece of today of all the stupid things that leftists are saying to spin the narrative of this murder away from radical Islam so he's got it's the gun that did it it's it's Christians and conservatives because they've opposed gay marriage you know and it's on and I toxic masculinity was my favorite one talks about now it's the guy the guy may have been gay he was apparently some of these witnesses said they had seen him on Grindr you know the gay dating app so is it gonna become about toxic homosexuality I always love when they tell you these monsters are gay and you think wow I knew there was something I didn't like about the guy but now they're gonna say oh it's toxic homosexuality no because they're not looking for the truth there's just spinning the narrative so if the narrative goes a different way they just distract you from you know everything which all puts together you know together makes Trump look brilliant I mean it makes him look brilliant yeah before but before we listen to this whole argument I just want to put forward how I see this what I see people what I think we're arguing about okay because you may wonder like why are they doing this you know and a lot of people say well Oh even Trump was kind of suggesting this yesterday that Obama must be secretly a Muslim that's not what this is about this is a very very Western phenomenon that we are seeing this argument has been going on since Jesus met Pilate okay when Jesus said I am the way in the truth and Pilate said what is truth you know what is truth there's no truth and and this and this argument intensified after the Reformation when suddenly the Catholic Church lost its monopoly on truth and people started to ask well if there is no monopoly on truth and how do we know what truth is that's the subject of Hamlet that is why Hamlet goes to school in Wittenberg I guess the neighbor where the Reformation began it's that's why he can't make a decision because he can't figure out what the truth is but this is this question got more and more intense in each a this is what Nietzsche dealt with this Dostoevsky done dealt with all through our culture this is the big question is there such a thing as moral truth how do you know it and there's this one side we'll call it the Pontius Pilate side this is now you know what is truth who knows who can say the reason this becomes such a desperate desperate question especially after World War one and and world war two is because if there is such a thing as truth if there's no such thing as truth then you have multiculturalism every culture is just as good as every other you don't know what's good you don't know what's bad you just think this because you're a Western or you just think the tolerance is good because you're a westerner somebody else thinks something else is good because he's not a Western who are you to say who are you to say that's supposed to bring peace and in the wake of World War one which was this devastating and meaningless war in which an entire generation of European manhood was wiped off the face of the earth and at the end of it nobody could tell why and World War two which was really just a continuation of that war when sudden which ended remember with the atom bomb and suddenly the world could be destroyed right if your culture is if one culture can be better than another then it's possible that this culture is the best that this culture is the best we have does me it's perfect that means that you were near perfect just means it's the best one we've got if that's true then you have to fight for it you have to defend it and if you have to defend it that means the whole generations of people may be wiped out it may mean atom bombs falling everywhere we don't know what it may mean with the current weaponry that we have so it's not that the left is being like nasty just trying to destroy everything they're acting they may not know this I mean I think but the argument has a certain amount of goodwill behind it it's just mistaken it just happens to be the wrong argument okay and that's why that's why they're so desperate for no one to say it's Islamism and if Islamism then it might be Islam that's why they are desperate for no-one to get in the way of their relativism because they're they think their relativism means peace we know it means evil because if you have no sense of what the good is its evil gun is gonna win the day because evil is gonna be aggressive so if you're not aggressive with good evil it's gonna move into that's what we know that but they think they're going to give us peace because nobody's going to argue anymore that's what's happening in Europe nobodies aren't you can are you that come in and rape your women you know you don't say anything just don't say anything because we'll have peace well you know we all know that what that kind of peace leads to and that's why Trump looks like such a genius he gets up and he makes a speech yesterday let's play Trump three just you just listen to him and it's the sound you just even I who really dislike Trump think oh thank you so go ahead play many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions remember this radical Islam is anti-woman anti-gay and anti-american I refused to allow America to become a place where gay people Christian people Jewish people are target's of persecution and intimidation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence this is not just a national security issue it's a quality of life issue if we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans women and children gay and straight Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now we need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores and it's coming with these people folks it's coming so I mean it's just he just sounds like it just sounds like common sense doesn't it now to be fair he said nutbag things yesterday too he was tweeting about how he you know basically he alone predicted that there would be more Islamic like like he just he's discovered this amazing thing that there are radical Islamics who want to kill us like nobody ever found this before Trump now that but but in fact Hillary Obama make him sound like that's true he also said this stuff which if they don't rein him in on this this is good this is the kind of thing that could cost him the election where he basically was suggesting he kept saying well he would phrase it in mysterious ways like Obama may have either doesn't know what he's doing or he knows all too well like you know like Ted Cruz killed Kennedy and now you know Obama is sitting there plotting to bring the caliphate to America he knows that there's a certain amount of crazy conspiratorial people on the right and he's playing to those people but it doesn't play with the rest of us because you just think like come on you know pull yourself together meanwhile meanwhile the New York Times are a former newspaper this is their headline right on the on the app on the iPad app blaming Muslims after attack Donald Trump tosses pluralism aside that's ejected news headline Donald Trump left little doubt on Monday that he intends to run on the same proposals on immigration and terrorism that animated his primary campaign using his first speech after the massacre in Orlando to propose sweeping measures against Muslims that pay little heed to American traditions of pluralism that's their that's their news so by the way this comes out in the same day that a poll comes out showing that people have lost all confidence in the news media all of it like now it says confidence in newspapers has hit an all-time low 20% have confidence in newspapers and they're like all Democrats they're all Democrats cuz they're hearing their own opinions come back at them so we know and that's that goes along with the 10-point drop in confidence in TV news as well we know you're lying to us we know you're lying you know it's like you it's you're not invisible we see you we know your line so if Trump goes on he says all this stuff but he's right that he has smoked he says you know Hillary Clinton won't even mention this and she should step down but she has started to sort of hint that maybe there is such a thing as Islam and maybe it's not as she said she said at one point that has nothing Muslims have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism she's backpedaling that a little bit because of him because of him he is forcing her to say stuff so she's still sticking with she's still sticking with the guns you know play Hillary to the second Hillary cut we may have our disagreements about gun safety regulations but we should all be able to agree on a few essential things if the FBI is watching you for a suspected terrorist links you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked that's her and you know it is funny because she's so self blind like when she said all women who complain about being molested enough to be believed you know she just she's on auto ly you know she can't stop the lies rolling out of herself but but it also it's so offensive it is so offensive to have these people who are surrounded by guns telling us we can't defend ourselves if I could afford her Secret Service I wouldn't own a gun I own a gun because I can't afford a the Secret Service is cheaper to have a gun than the Secret Service she has that you know and she is under FBI investigation no matter what she says so she shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a Secret Service man the Secret Service should be edgy no way I'm sorry we can't bring our guns too close to you yeah the other thing she says but play cut number three about the funding for starters it is long past time for the Saudis the gutter ease and the Kuwait ease and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations and they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path toward extremism and the reason she's saying this is because she wants them to continue to contribute to the Clinton Foundation because like 25 the Saudis gave her 25 million dong all these people who oppressed gays and oppress women they've given funneled all this money so that's why she's saying they've got to stop supporting extremism and save their money to give it to me because you know I got to retire after this you know if I in case I lose or after I'm president you know I've got to retire need some money so send the money to me and stop funding extremism there was my favorite piece of commentary yesterday because now Hillary does this thing that she does it's not enough for her to change one life or another lie she has to tell you in spite of the fact that we all have YouTube and we can all see you know that it's not true she has to tell you that she always said this I always said that I had a you know that I was selling secrets to the Russians you know no no no I never said that I didn't have a secret email you know a private email server I always said so now she's saying I always said that you know we was radical Islam I just don't know what difference does it make you know if I call it that as long as we killed the people and all this stuff so yesterday Brett Baier on his panel called her out by showing this clip and Krauthammer followed it up with one of the I think he won the day's commentary award with this this comment places here's what Clinton said December about this what's the problem with radical Islam well the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion and that to me is number one wrong even though the qualifier radical is there no because look you know enough about religion you've studied it and there are radicals people who believe all kinds of things in every religion in the world and she reiterated that of the debate a democratic debate this primary season we're back with the panel the back and forth today I Charles well Hillary and the term radical Islam what is the change between the interview and today no Bernie Sanders the campaign is over it doesn't have to appeal to her left so all of a sudden she discovers the term which is the reason I really like completely cynical liberals who have no principles they will occasionally get it right with a principled liberal they'll get it wrong every time but with Hillary as soon as it is now convenient she will continue to say radicalism which is a good thing and one reason it's a good thing is what you guys were discussing about the attack on Barr the fact is that unless you say what kind of extremism it is you don't understand any connections that's what makes Obama's refusal so incomprehensible and unnerving he knows there's a connection when you say radical Islam you are encompassing all of the elements of it of which one is a radical opposition and hatred of gays it's I mean it's a great piece of commentary and it's one of the things that it was actually great about Bill Clinton was that he had no principles and that he went bout with the wind and when the voters voted out the Democratic Congress and voted in the Republicans he changed he basically became a conservative president at least at home and that really was a good thing she the problem with her is that she just lies and then follows this ideology she's far more of a rock-ribbed left winger then her husband ever was so Krauthammer is also right about Obama I mean Obama is doing these two the two big things they feel have some traction the Left feels some traction to keep us from looking at radical Islam and all the implications of that are the guns and the lone wolf idea you know that it's not it's not a movement it's just a lone wolf and it's like the problem is that these guys get gun said by the way you know some people think that Obama is trolling the right and I have to admit that there are times when I think Obama is trolling the right he's just trying to make us angry but in general in general I think Obama is just a nincompoop and when I say that what I mean is not that he has a low IQ we obviously has a very high IQ what I mean is that he's got this ideology it's wrong the ideology describes the world falsely but it has led him to the top of the world he is now one of the most powerful people have not the most powerful people on earth so the ideology has served him well we've got no reason to change it and he's a narcissist he's got a personality disorder he cannot cannot be criticized he cannot take criticism and he cannot take self-criticism so he never says I'm wrong I did hear him do the same thing Hilary does I never said I never drew a red line there's no red line you know I'm not the one who talked about the bathrooms where you know the transgender people should go in the bathroom I mean it doesn't matter that it's all over YouTube he doesn't care it's just he cannot take criticism so he can't change his mind so here he is yesterday talking to reporters about the lone wolf and the fan he's not this is not trolling I think he's self blind he's self blind as far as we can tell right now this is certainly an example of the kind of homegrown extremism that all of us have been so concerned about for a very long time it also appears that he was able to obtain these weapons legally because he did not have a criminal record that in some ways were prohibited from purchasing these weapons it appears that one of those weapons he was anything that have just carry out of the store an assault rifle a handgun a block which had a lot of clicks enter he was apparently required to wait for three days under Florida law but it does indicate the degree to which it was not difficult for him to obtain these caps of weapons so I'm gonna read Brett Stevens has a column the foreign you know he writes on Foreign Affairs in the Wall Street Journal here's a company I'm gonna try if I have time and we're tired and read as much of it as I possibly can because it tells you just about everything you need to know about what you just heard from Obama it's Brett Stevens Wall Street Journal in the spring of 2013 Barack Obama delivered the defining speech of his presidency on the subject of terrorism its premise was wrong as was its thesis as were its predictions and recommendations we are now paying the price for this cascade of folly here's the quote today Osama bin Laden is dead and so are most of his top lieutenants the president boasted at the National Defense University in Washington DC there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States and our homeland is more secure the future of terrorism he explained consisted of less capable al Qaeda affiliates remember this is the varsity team or whatever the JV team localized threats against Westerners and faraway places such as Algeria and homegrown killers like the Boston Marathon bombers Stevens goes on to say all of the suggested that it was time to call it quits on what mr. Obama derided as a boundless global war on terror that meant sharply curtailing drone strikes completing the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan and closing Guantanamo prison it meant renewing efforts to promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians and seeking transitions to democracy in Libya and Egypt and Ament working with Congress to repeal the 2001 authorization for use of military force against al-qaeda this war like all wars must end Obama said that's what history advises that's what our democracy demands now Stephen says King Canute of legend stood on an English shoreline and ordered the tide to recede President Knut stood before a Beltway audience and ordered the war to and neither tide nor war obeyed now I just want to add here by the way that King canoed this is a famous legend that King Canute attacked the waves King Canute was trying to show his advisors that there was a limit to the Kings power he was putting on a demonstration I was trying to do the opposite he was trying to show that there was no limit he was just gonna declare the war over and it didn't matter what the other side said here he goes Brett Stephens again in 2010 al-qaeda in Iraq is lonex state's predecessor was dead on its feet said Obama I'm sorry as expert Michael Knight told Congress worldwide the US government estimated al-qaeda's total strength at no more than 4,000 fighters that was the result of george w bush's surge in iraq of mr. Obama's own surge in Afghanistan and of the aggressive campaign of drone killings in Pakistan and Yemen but then the Obama doctrine kicked in between 2010 and 2013 the number of jihadis worldwide went up to a hundred thousand while the number of jihadist groups rose by 58 percent according to a RAND Corporation study that was before Isis declared its Caliphate apologist for mr. Obama will rejoin that it's unfair to blame him for trends and terrorism an argument that would have more credibility if he hadn't been so eager to take credit for those trends only three years ago the same apologist also claimed that the u.s. cannot possibly cure what ails the Middle East and that no law-enforcement agency can stop a lone wolf terrorists such as Omar Mateen the guy in Orlando but these arguments fail the rise of Isis was predictable result of mr. Obama's abdication in Iraq and especially Syria a result mr. Obama himself foresaw in his 2013 speech quote we must strengthen the Opposition in Syria while isolating extremist elements he said because the end of a tyrant must not give way to the tyranny of terrorism was the opposition strengthened as Stevens were the extremists isolated as for lone wolves one study from last year cited 38 cases of lone-wolf terrorism 38 listen carefully between 40 and 2001 38 cases of lone-wolf terrorism between 1940 and 2001 another 12 during the eight years of the Bush administration and more than 50 since then the phenomenon is catching in part because Isis is canny at using the internet and social media to attract and activate recruits but what Isis mainly does is give aimless and insignificant young men what most young men secretly crave a cause worth dying for which brings me back to what I was talking about in the beginning okay I've said this before and some people take it as anti-female it's not a nation a culture goes where its young men go if if young men go down the drain the culture will go down the drain this is first simple reason if you have two tribes and one tribe is a tribe there's run by women on women's principles and the other is a tribe run by men on men's principles soon there will be only one tribe it will be the tribe of the men because they will come over and kill the men in the women's drive and take the women that's the way the world works the best we can hope for the best we can hope for is a civilization in which men pay attention to women and respect them and elevate them and listen to their opinion and outlook with respect and included in the world that's why you have chivalry that is the point of opening doors for women that is the point of being polite to women it's to inculcate in young men and in the entire civilization the idea that these people are half the world they have an important point of view they matter you do that you do that by paying them respect and having them pay you respect as men when you lose that when you have a world that becomes cultural that becomes feminized it will die it will be killed by cultures like the Muslim culture that are pure you know you want to see what pure masculinity looks like that's it killing aiding destroying that's what men do without women to balance the world ok so when he when Stevens talks about men wanting something that worth dying for that means the culture having something to believe in and if you have a culture that tells you day by day that there's no right there's no wrong it's all about your cult you say one thing and another person says one thing as if it were like Chinese food versus American food you know it's not it's not we have a different culture it was formed by Christianity and Christianity was like a container that included classical and Jewish thought and brought that in and that is what we believe it doesn't matter whether you believe in Christianity you believe in Christianity you don't know it but you do all all you know I was talking about this yesterday about the argument about gays being a family feud listen to the way people argue they're arguing about who is more Christian the people who are openly evangelical Christian or saying no it's correct you know here here it says in the Bible that you know sexual impropriety is bad and among the sexual sins is homosexuality says it right there the other side is saying well you're not being forgiving you're not being loving you're not just you know judging not a Christian principle they're arguing for who is more Christian without knowing what they're arguing about when we lose our basis when we use the basis of what we think when we don't educate ourselves what where we come from and where our ideas come from we lose the possibility of standing up for ourselves and that's what worries me because Stevens is right Isis is offering young men something to die for and we're not and the left isn't and that's what this argument is about it's not it's not about Oh Muslims are to blame guns are to blame it's about whether there is such a thing as right and wrong whether it is a real thing and whether maybe we see it in our culture overall better than the Middle Eastern culture season okay I think we're that's all the time I have so so let me before I go into the stuff I like one thing I want you to look at if you will please it's Father's Day is coming up if you go on PJ media's parenting page you will see an article that happens to be about me as a father it's called three things my father taught me that I hope one day to teach my son it's written by my lovely daughter faith and you go on PJ media and you hit the parenting thing at the top and it will take you to three things my father taught me that I hope one day to teach my son and the reason you have to do this is because in the very first line she tells you something about me I won't tell you what it is but she tells you something important about me that will help you to listen to the show it will understand what you were hearing when you listen to the show so going let's look at three things my father taught me that I have to teach my son first very first sentence it'll tell you all everything you need to know about listening to the show all right stuff I like we've been talking about film noir here's one that is really exciting because you probably haven't seen it and it's it's really an interesting movie called the killing from 1956 and what's interesting about it is this one of Stanley Kubrick's earliest films remember the guy who did 2001 this is before he kind of went nuts I hate 2001 and I hate most of the films Kubrick made after that but this I think is if this isn't his best film it's certainly right up there he wrote it with Jim Thompson the famous hard-boiled writer who wrote The Stranger inside me The Grifters he wrote just a ton of things that you've seen at the movies and so he was one of the most famous most not in his lifetime but afterwards he become became one of the most famous noir tough-guy writers listen to this here is a sterling Hayden one of the un one of the forgotten great tough-guy actors telling he it's about a heist and Hayden is the lead guy and one of his accomplices mauls has been listening in on their plan and here he confronts her all right sister that's a mighty pretty head you've got in your shoulders you want to keep it there maybe we could compromise and put it on your shoulder I think that'd be nice don't you oh you're doing outside that door oh you you would mentor Arthur's cocaine yes wasn't that naughty of me but I'm afraid I was I found an address in George's pocket I thought he might be playing around with another woman so I came hoping you'd care if he was playing another Dame that would bother you you don't understand me Johnny you don't know me very well I know you like a book you're a no-good nosy little tramp you'd sell out your own mother for a piece of fudge but you're smart along with it smart enough to know when to sell and when to sit tight and you know you better sit tight in this case I do you heard me you like money you got a great big dollar sign there where most women ever hard so play it smart stay in character you'll have money plenty of a george'll haven't you blow it all on you probably buy himself a 5 cent cigar hmm
