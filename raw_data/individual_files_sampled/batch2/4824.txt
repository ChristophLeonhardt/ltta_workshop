James Comey still does not get it I read his new book this weekend and that's honestly what comes through the most of course we all make mistakes and pressure does increase the margin for error Comey faced a lot of pressure in 2016 but now it's 2018 and with more hindsight James Comey is using this book in this moment to double down on his biggest mistakes on the things that Comey did not the things that were done to him by Trump on the decisions that Comey made that impact law and order and maybe the future of our republic in this book I'm gonna tell you James Comey doesn't acknowledge all those mistakes he doesn't even reckon with a lot of the public legal substantive criticism so if Comey won't tackle the big questions in this book I think we still can so right now tonight I want to offer you my take on key points from the book with a big caveat that of course I have far less experience than James Comey he's one of the most seasoned prosecutors in America I know far less about these cases at hand I'm relying obviously on publicly available information he knows some secrets the rest of us don't have but let's get into it James Comey writes that as a matter of law the Clinton email case would probably not lead to prosecutions because it takes more than mishandling classified information to get to a charge you'd have to typically deliberately leak it means it's a long way from a lost-and-found box to Edward Snowden and here's how he puts it Comey writes we started the Clinton investigation aware it was unlikely to be a case that career nonpartisan prosecutors at the DOJ would prosecute and the Clinton case thus started as an exercise in double-checking there was no deliberate leaking and it ended with the FBI conclusion that there was no deliberate leaking that would make it a simple case to close but of course as we know James Comey broke with tradition when he stepped out there for that unusual press conference in the middle of the campaign and he admits this was an effort to impact public perception good morning I'm here to give you an update on the FBI's investigation of secretary Clinton's use of a personal email system during her time Secretary of State although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this we are expressing to justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case no charge is appropriate call me broke tradition and rules with that dramatic statement on the tradition closing a case is usually done in private as we reported at the time this was a little unusual in an abundance of transparency so we just saw and Secretary Clinton President Obama everyone learning at the same time moments ago the FBI director saying this is what our evidence showed this is what we found and we're making a recommendation of no charges to the prosecutors at the Justice Department typically that would happen privately that was that day typically privately as for the rules the FBI doesn't decide whether to charge people prosecutors decide that Comey made the announcement though as you just saw in a way that took the charging decision effectively from the prosecutors which was a mistake it undercut the DOJ and box them in and fanned controversy around the already politically hot case it failed to do the narrow and unnecessary thing that Comey writes in his book to this day that was his goal defending DOJ independence he says though that potentially false political attacks on the Obama DOJ an attorney general Lynch would enable partisans to argue powerfully that the Clinton campaign through Lynch had been controlling the FBI's investigation that argument from Comey is so illogical circular and frankly dumb it's actually hard to follow but it's also important so here we go Comey is claiming that even though the FBI independently cleared Clinton and it would be false to claim the Clinton campaign controlled the DOJ he was so worried that partisans would lie and say that he changed his entire FBI approach to the case as a preemptive rebuttal to that potential lie and that's wrong on substance Comey admitting that as FBI director he decided to sort of shadowbox with partisan lies instead of just doing his job it's also wrong on strategy because in case James come we didn't notice over the past two years Donald Trump and a lot of partisan hacks accused the FBI and any other opponent of Lies anyway it's absurd to think that people hell-bent on attacking Clinton and the FBI are gonna reverse themselves because James Comey gave a dramatic press conference but Comey admits in this new book to still believing his special political status would save the whole operation he writes quote as a Republican he thought his public statements about Clinton would help attorney general Lynch more than had he been a Democrat let that sink in Comey is admitted part of his reasoning was that his own political credentials as a Republican appointee would give the Obama DOJ cover that is not a reason for the FBI to do something and then on the smaller point it's also obviously naive Comey seems to think that Trump fans would credit his history with the Bush administration of course if you watch the news you'll remember Trump was on the campaign trail at the time savaging the Bush administration and other top Republicans the political world had already cleaved into pro Trump and anti Hillary and now two years later Trump has made his own attacks on James Comey quite clear so keep that in mind as you read the Comey can still write these following words with a straight face to justify the second public intervention in the Clinton case that famed October email announcement he writes once again it became my responsibility to take the hit Comey says that to explain why he went public with Clinton emails he hadn't even read yet arguing he could only handle the hit from a crisis of his own making only he could handle that now that's more than hutzpah it's more than delusion it is the kind of grandiose rationalization that calls your judgment into question and everyone remembers Comey inserted himself into the campaign that extra time breaking with tradition to tell Cong about Clinton emails his agents found that hadn't been reviewed I also remember covering that story that night when the news broke it was apparent to many of us that first day that announcing new evidence to the world in a campaign before reviewing it was a self-inflicted mess the FBI would have to clean up Jim Comey may have been trying to do the right thing legally but has done it so poorly and so vaguely that practically it is a mess and distortive and something he may ultimately feel he needs to clean up in the next eleven days which itself would invite more scrutiny and that's what happened within the next eleven days before the election Comey tried to clean it up by announcing the emails didn't change anything in the Clinton case now there's no factual debate about this part we know now the Comey made the wrong call he rushed to announce the emails but the FBI determined within days that most of that material was not actually new evidence that all the emails were quote duplicates and had they only followed the normal process of reviewing evidence before going forward with it there wouldn't be anything to go forward with so keep those facts in mind when you read this in the book Comey says I still believe even in hindsight his approach on that Clinton matter was the best thing for the FBI and DOJ so that's all the Clinton stuff in the book then there's the Trump probe what about the different standard Comey used to keep the Trump Russia case secret in 2016 well I know the books new I have a spoiler alert James Comey also thinks he got that decision perfectly right as well your critics say this is a clear clear clear double standard you revealed information about Hillary Clinton you concealed information about Donald Trump that elected Donald Trump the Hillary Clinton email case was public and the care intelligence investigations trying to figure out whether a small group of people not Donald Trump we were not investigating Donald Trump whether this small group of Americans was coordinating anything with the Russians we had just started the investigation didn't know whether we had anything so would have been brutally unfair to those people to talk about it brutally unfair comit√© assessment of Donald Trump in this book is withering and it's largely built on commis firsthand serve Asians backed up by his meticulous notes which do make him a credible witness against the Trump White House despite these other mistakes now Comey also in this book exposes more of his lapses in judgment and a type of bias which is important but he doesn't come across as anything less than honest and relying the facts but now on the book tour Comey has already now newly committed another error in judgment about this time the Trump probe which is pretty significant remember of course he's a witness to the facts he's not a prosecutor or a judge in the case but faced with the question of what should happen at the end of this criminal process where any witness should just take a plat to take a pass and let the process go where it goes well James Comey is now weighing in on that too we don't yet know what Muller will find and whether it will serve up further questions for the courts or Congress but James Comey already announcing he is against this probe leading to potential action by Congress I hope not because I think impeaching and removing Donald Trump from office would let the American people off the hook and have something happen indirectly that I believe they're duty-bound to do directly people in this country need to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values unbelievable after a book-length lecture on avoiding politics James Comey is using his newfound rhetorical freedom to tell people to vote their values against Trump of course many people felt they were voting their values when they chose Trump over 16 2 million people did that and Trump may yet get reelected so besides being tone deaf and political the answer undercuts an open criminal investigation by special counsel Muller who is yet to release or complete public findings prejudging that outcome and any possible remedies would be a mistake for any witness in this probe but for a witness this central a witness who used to run the FBI a witness who made these famous failures in 2016 by speaking out prematurely about other political investigations a witness who knows better how do you explain making that kind of mistake in the middle of all this right now the same way most mistakes are made if you don't address your past mistakes you are doomed to repeat them hey there are Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
