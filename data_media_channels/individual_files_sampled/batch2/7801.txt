here's some good news for you the STI gonorrhea is growing increasingly resistant to antibiotics and in some forms might be literally impossible to cure wh o did an analysis of literally dozens of countries and found that resistance to antibiotics the commonly used ones and even the ones used in emergencies is going up but don't worry about that that's not the important thing doctors in Japan Spain and France have reported individual cases in which they were unable to cure it like using any of the antibiotics that they have even the like the rare ones the ones that are for emergencies nothing it didn't matter it's still there and this is not a small thing an estimated 78 million people a year infected with gonorrhea Jesus that is a lot if you aren't familiar with this you're welcome but symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs pain when urinating and bleeding during periods this is not something that you want you can avoid it thankfully by using a protection during sex but this is an issue and it can manifest in a couple of particularly dangerous ways gonorrhea can infect the genitals rectum and throat but it can be more dangerous in certain of those so theoretically oh when it gets in the throat and people take antibiotics it can it's sort of a harbor harboring spot for resistance to grow and there it can sort of become stronger and stronger they worded it this way at the BBC thrusting gonorrhea bacteria into this environment through oral sex can lead to super gonorrhea and so that is why oral sex in particular can lead to the worst kinds of gonorrhea right now thrusting the gonorrhea bacteria curious choice of words when you grow up you'll understand I don't think it's a curious choice of words I think they literally mean what you think they think they mean but yeah this is a huge problem I mean not this there are STI is there that are worse objectively there are ones that will literally kill you drive you insane and things like that but this is not a good thing for people to have and this is not the only STI or the only infection or disease that that has this sort of looming threat of antibiotic resistance the way that we approach ain't about us as a species is fundamentally flawed it has been for a long time and it's II arete ik Lee will take a massive toll in human lives if we correct in the future because it's used more way too liberally exactly for things that it doesn't need to and we are developing new antibiotics theoretic theoretically we can although it's becoming harder and harder slower and slower rarer and rarer but gonorrhea in particular it can overcome all of that we are not able to come right now to come up with one that's gonna kill all strains permanently and and in diseases that are even more deadly like we need to address this is that something that's sexy to talk about especially with the discharge but it is something that's important for human civilization no as I was reading this guy's it sounded like the beginning of a apocalyptic movie where scientists are warning that we have quote a relentless march towards untreatable status and they give warnings like 66% of reporting countries say one particular strand of gonorrhea is that is normally treated with I think an injection is no is not responding anymore okay u3 yeah yeah 81% of reporting countries say that the other strain has now become resistant and not responding anymore and then you get the reports from Japan France etc saying there's no treatment left and luckily though it only affects the genitals rectum and throat right I just want cushy diapers if they mean like I wonder if you can't die from it then what's the worst that can happen when I see this film will we cast Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling will they be paid equally well they produce equal discharge and and so then they get into I'm just I'm going with you on the apocalyptic thing here yes hey because then the next part of the movie is they're like oh by the way you know can't you see the scientists rushing and in the movie right like it is now called super gonorrhea Yeah right and then of course in the next part of the movies what John is alluding to which is it's no longer just in the throat rectum and genitals now we can't treat other diseases that is spreading all over the world and all over them and by the way most of the countries are not even reporting in the poor countries are not reporting in and the situation is probably more dire in the poor countries so as we get as we overuse the antibiotics we become very susceptible to all kinds of diseases and so that disaster is also looming out there super gonorrhea just the beginning just an appetizer watch the young turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it anyway you like at TYT Network calm slash join
