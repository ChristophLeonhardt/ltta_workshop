1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,860
A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED IN
FAVOR OF A PRELIMINARY

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,309
INJUNCTION AGAINST TEXAS'S
TOUGH SANCTUARY CITIES LAW.

3
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:13,530
SENATE BILL FOR WHICH IS THE
LAW IN QUESTION ESSENTIALLY

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,990
FORCES POLICE OFFICIALS TO ASK
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY SUSPECTED

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,930
OF BEING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS
FOR THEIR PAPERWORK TO PROVE

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,400
THAT THEY ARE IN THE COUNTRY
LEGALLY AND IT HAS A NUMBER OF

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,030
OTHER ELEMENTS THAT THIS FEDERAL
JUDGE DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,340
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS
COMPLETELY BLOCKED IT, IT JUST

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,340
MEANS

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,030
THAT THERE WILL BE A STAY OR
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,940
TELL THIS CASE BEARS OUT IN
COURT.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:01:01,889
SO I WANT TO 

13
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:03,660
STOP THERE FOR A
2ND.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,680
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SANCTUARY
CITIES, THE WAY THAT IT IS

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,600
OFTEN DISCUSSED IN THE MEDIA IS
MISLEADING.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,600
IT MAKES IT SEEM AS THOUGH IN
SANCTUARY CITIES, LOCAL

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,000
COPS REFUSE TO WORK WITH ICE
OFFICIALS OR FEDERAL AGENTS

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,960
BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT THE
CASE.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,640
WHAT ICE AGENTS ASK FOR IS A
CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES TO

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,240
DETAIN PEOPLE FOR AN INDEFINITE
OF TIME UNTIL THEY CAN

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,649
PROVE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS IN
THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

22
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:35,240
THAT TAKES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
OF RESOURCES.

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,590
OUR PRISON SYSTEM AND OUR JAILS
ARE OBVIOUSLY OVERFULL AND

24
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,049
SO CERTAIN CITIES HAVE SUIT
AGAINST THAT BECAUSE THEY

25
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,479
ARE LIKE WE CAN'T JUST DETAIN
PEOPLE INDEFINITELY.

26
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,320
THIS IS A MAKE SENSE.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,159
THERE ACTUALLY SEVERAL
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS.

28
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,149
CENTURY CITY IS NOT A REAL
DESIGNATION SO THERE IS NOT

29
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,340
A DESIGNATION FOR AND THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,049
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH IN

31
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,359
TERMS OF SIX WERE A CITIES.

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,960
SOME I AM LESS SURE ABOUT.

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,619
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY SAY WE'RE NOT
GOING TO PULL PEOPLE OVER

34
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,310
LIKE SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO DID IN
TEXAS AND ASK FOR THE PAPERS.

35
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,841
IT'S ON OUR JURISDICTION TYPE
THEY ARE IN THE COUNTRY AND

36
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,459
COUNTRY LEGALLY THAT IS A
FEDERAL CASE NOT A STATE OR

37
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,459
LOCAL.

38
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,940
2ND OF ALL, WE CAMP WILL PEOPLE
OVER AND LET ME HAVE SOME

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,790
SORT OF PROBABLE CAUSE AND YOU
LOOK LATINO IS NOT PROBABLE

40
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,010
CAUSE SO THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL
A CENTURY CITY WERE THEY

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,110
DIRECT THEIR COPS NOT TO BE
RACIST, GREAT.

42
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,980
I LOVE IT I'M TOTALLY IN FAVOR
OF IT.

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,299
THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF WHAT
THEY CALL CENTURY CITY WERE

44
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,400
SOMETIMES ICE WILL SAY YOU
ARRESTED THAT GUY ON A

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,730
DIFFERENT CHARGE BUT WE HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE HE IS IN

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,049
THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

47
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,060
HOLD HIM.

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,069
THAT IS RIGHT IS TO BE A TOUGHER
ISSUE.

49
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,360
PROBABLY WAY AND WAS REFERRING
TO THEIR BECAUSE LOOK, THAT IS

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,909
YOUR JURISDICTION NOT MINE AND I
DON'T WANT MY TAXPAYERS PAYING

51
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,409
FOR IT AND PLUS, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU

52
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,519
TURN THE LOCAL COPS AND ICE
OFFICIALS THEN THE PEOPLE IN THE

53
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,920
AREA ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO TALK
TO THE COPS AND REPORT CRIMES.

54
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,879
IT'S ACTUALLY THE COPS IN THOSE
CITIES WHO SAY NO, WE DON'T WANT

55
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,250
TO HOLD, SERVE AS A HOLDING PEN
FOR ICE BECAUSE THAT IS

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,060
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR
INTERESTS AS LOCAL POLICE

57
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,060
OFFICERS.

58
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,209
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FROM US

59
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,900
EVERYONE'S INTEREST WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF PEOPLE WHO

60
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,409
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO COMPASSION
FOR ANYONE.

61
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,099
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THEY HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT

62
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,730
INDIVIDUAL MIGHT BE IN THE
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, RIGHT?

63
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,569
THEY ASKED ME CITIES IN THESE
COPS TO DETAIN THESE PEOPLE

64
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,840
INDEFINITELY UNTIL THEY GET
AROUND TO INVESTIGATING THE

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,319
SITUATION.

66
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,849
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO
INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION

67
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,050
OR GET TO THAT PARTICULAR CASE
AND WHAT IF THAT PERSON IS IN

68
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,599
THE COUNTRY LEGALLY AND IN A LOT
OF CASES, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.

69
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,390
AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID
THIS RIGHT THEN WE WOULD

70
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,459
HAVE A LOT LESS OF AN ISSUE.

71
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,150
MY PROPOSAL WOULD BE, LISTEN, IF
YOU THINK SOMEONE IS IN THE

72
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,400
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND THEIR
SENTENCES UP AT A LOCAL

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
LEVEL, GO GET THEM.

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,870
PUT THEM IN A FEDERAL HOLDING
FACILITY AND BY THE WAY,

75
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,850
GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS WHICH
INCLUDES A SPEEDY TRIAL.

76
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,839
IF YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE
BROKEN THE LAW OR THEY ARE

77
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,940
HERE ILLEGALLY, THEN HURRY UP
AND HANDLE THAT IN A

78
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,060
CONSTITUTIONAL WAY.

79
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,509
IF YOU SAY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO
BE ABLE TO HOLD SOMEBODY

80
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,000
WHETHER THEY WERE POSITIVE OR
NOT THAT THEY ARE LIVING IN

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,750
THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND I
WOULD LIKE A LONG TIME AND

82
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,810
I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT, YOU
PAY FOR IT.

83
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,960
THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,120
NOW IN TEXAS PASSES A LAW SAYING
THE CITIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO

85
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,340
ANY OF THIS.

86
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,550
THEY MUST FOLLOW THE ORDERS OF
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVEN

87
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,680
THOUGH THAT IS NOT THEIR
JURISDICTION AND IF THEY

88
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,100
DON'T, WE ARE GOING TO PUT THOSE
COPS IN PRISON.

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,740
WAY, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE FOR
COPS.

90
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,100
IT'S AMAZING.

91
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,380
THE COPS COULD POTENTIALLY FACE
CRIMINAL CHARGES OF THEY REFUSE

92
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,479
TO COMPLY UNDER THIS LAW AND
THEN THE OTHER PART OF IT IS

93
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,910
EVEN IF IT'S AN ELECTED OFFICIAL
WHO REFUSES TO COMPLY WITH WHAT

94
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,310
FEDERAL OFFICIALS WANT, THAT
ELECTED OFFICIAL COULD BE TAKEN

95
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,360
OUT OF OFFICE BASED ON THE
WORDING OF THIS LAW AND SO THE

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,210
FEDERAL JUDGE IN THIS CASE WHO
DECIDED TO ISSUE THIS

97
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,720
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION WAS LIKE
YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,070
UNCONSTITUTIONAL COMPONENTS HERE
AND AS A RESULT, I AM GOING TO

99
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,919
GO AHEAD AND PAUSE UNTIL THIS
CASE BEARS OUT IN COURT.

100
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,590
KEEP IN MIND THERE WERE SEVERAL
CITIES WITHIN TEXAS THAT

101
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,690
SUIT AGAINST THE SENATE BILL.

102
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,800
THAT INCLUDED HOUSTON, AUSTIN,
SAN ANTONIO, AND DALLAS.

103
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:04,699
MANNY FERNANDEZ FOR THE NEW YORK
TIMES WRITES:

104
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,919
THERE IS A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE
HERE AS WELL BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

105
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,349
GOVERNMENT IS OBVIOUSLY
ATTEMPTING TO TAKE ACTION

106
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:15,510
AGAINST LOCAL GOVERNMENT OVER A
DIFFERENCE IN POLITICAL OPINION.

107
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,960
I KNOW THAT THE RIGHT WING IS
GOING TO SUPPORT THE JUDGE

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,830
BECAUSE THEY COULD HEAR CARE
DEEPLY ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH

109
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,360
SO WHEN ONE OF THEIR OWN WANTS
TO GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
SPEAK ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS, THAT
IS A FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISSUE.

111
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,910
WHEN NAZIS MARK MARCH IN
CHARLOTTESVILLE THAT IS A

112
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,229
FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISSUE.

113
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,400
WHEN LOCAL COUNSEL AND HAVE
THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH,

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,960
NO, WE ARE AGAINST COPS AND WE
WANT THEM SPEAK.

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,530
THAT IS A CONSERVATIVE POSITION
IN TEXAS AND A FEDERAL

116
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,650
JUDGE HAS SAID NO, THAT IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

117
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,650
EXACTLY.

118
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,220
IN FACT I WANT TO
READ YOU HIS QUOTE BECAUSE I

119
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
THINK

120
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,750
IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT GIVES
YOU A SENSE OF WHERE HE IS

121
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,400
COMING FROM.

122
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:59,629
JUDGE GARCIA WRITES:

123
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:08,250
DAMN.

124
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,360
I'M SURE THE RIGHT WING WILL
TURN AROUND NOW AND SAVE

125
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,840
BLUE LIVES MATTER, BLUE SPEECH
MATTERS AND LET'S PROTECT

126
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,270
THE LOCAL COPS AGAINST THIS
OVERREACH BY THE STATE

127
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,270
GOVERNMENT.

128
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,770
WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT.

129
00:07:19,770 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR
AGREEMENT ON THIS ISSUE.
