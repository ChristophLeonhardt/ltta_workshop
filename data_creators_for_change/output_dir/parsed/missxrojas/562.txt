I believe that I have learnt a lot from
the hybrid series I'll say openly that I
think that they contain a lot of wisdom
a lot of life lessons that I'm just
things just how to better live your life
a happier person but I have to say the
most important accurate useful thing
that I have learned is that chocolate
really helps to deal with the shock of a
dementia visit
