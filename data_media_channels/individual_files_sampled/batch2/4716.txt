when surprised today hit judge pret Cavanaugh he was grilled over this newly revealed email about overturning Roe vs. Wade in it he wrote I'm not sure all legal scholars refer to Roe it's settled law of the land at the Supreme Court because it can always overrule its precedent as I was just discussing with Senator Whitehouse now abortion access is at the center of so many protests of Cavanaugh which includes actress and activists Alyssa Milano she joins us in a moment now in this confirmation hearing the judge was pressing on a case about a pregnant immigrant teen who was detained at the u.s. border seeking an abortion Cavanaugh dissented in that controversial case saying she didn't have a right without matching up with a sponsor now take a look at this but Judge the clock is ticking it is the clock is ticking twenty week clock is ticking and she made the decision early in the pregnancy and all that I described to you and the judicial decisions the clock is ticking and you are suggesting that she should have waited to have a sponsor appointed who she may or may not have consulted in making this decision again this is I'm a judge I'm not making the policy decision my job is to decide whether that policy is consistent with law if you listen that closely Cavanaugh claiming he was following the law but of course that Court ruled that the law was the teen could get an abortion Milano has been highlighting this problem here she isn't a video speaking on behalf of that very team I'm Jane Doe when I was 17 I crossed the border I was 17 when I was detained I was 17 and soon I would learn that I was I was pregnant and after they examined me I asked for an abortion the Trump administration tried to stop me Brett Kavanaugh tried to stop me she's been campaigning against Kavanagh with former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and wrote an Elle magazine Kavanagh must be stopped now right before I left Washington while covering these hearings I was able to interview Milano and I began by asking her why spotlight this issue it's not just about Kavanagh it's not about Trump this issue is about my daughter this issue is about my mother this issue is about the health care of the underprivileged the marginalized the people that that live in low-income communities because really it's those people that are that are gonna be affected most by this you know Trump made a promise during his campaign that he was going to appoint judges Supreme Court judges that would overturn roe v wade which has been the law of the land for the last you know over 40 years and and we have all entertained this this idea and this presidency regardless of their they're trying to push this through regardless of the fact that they served 40,000 pages of documents only hours before the hearing were to start and and I don't know in any other court that that would be permissible time and time again I feel like we are entertaining the absurdity of this presidency and and one of one of these key issues for me and I think women across the country again especially women in low-income and the marginalized is this issue of getting access to safe abortion Cavanagh only has 37 percent of the American people so not only is is this a bad choice that that Senate is making but they're making a choice going against what the American people feel and we'll listen you mentioned that let me let me put I just want to put to your point some of that data on the screen for viewers you mentioned have enough support around 37% Donald Trump in a range of polls has about 40% or 35 percent range approval and then roe v wade as I think you know is actually up at 64% and that goes into the next thing that we wanted to ask you about which is activists have been protesting a Cavanaugh some of them dressed up like The Handmaid's Tale costumes and I know you did that as well you posted a photo on Twitter we saw these activists outside the entire festivities or rally or hearings and for those who haven't read the book we want to show a clip from the series you girls will serve the leaders and their barren wives you will bear children with them culture drives these policies and politics explain to us or for our viewers who might even be less familiar with that novel why you're putting it in this perspective and why gender equality it seems to be such an issue that people are concerned about in the context of Judge Cavanaugh well I think for a number of reasons first of all if we take this presidency as a whole before he was elected you know we had 18 women come forward saying that he had sexually harassed or abused and maybe assaulted them and then we have systematically watched this president and the administration rolled back or attempt to roll back women's rights and it's heartbreaking and it's sad and I think we're feeling that in the courtroom with the protesters and I think that we're really getting a glimpse into the the corruption and how these major corporations have really taken precedent over the American people and I'm hopeful that that things will will change because I am an optimist but it's it's been a very trying time for for anyone in the position right to use their voice to affect positive change because ultimately right what I do and my passion is to be the voice of those that have no voice well I'd have to imagine that many people watching would understand and share some of those feelings and you said a little earlier you don't do this full-time of course the building behind me was supposed to be responsive to all the people who don't do this full-time to citizens and so using your you're following your platform to reach a lot of citizens is why we wanted to hear from you on this Cavanaugh fight Alyssa Milano
