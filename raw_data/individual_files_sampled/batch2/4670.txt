NBC's Ken Delaney and who is outside the courthouse here in Washington can it appears we know more about Paul Manafort he's pleaded guilty he's reached a deal that's right Stephanie Robert Mulder's office has just filed a superseding criminal information against Paul Manafort showing that he intends to plead guilty today to a host of charges that he was about to stand trial on next week in Washington DC he's going to go into this courthouse behind me at 11 o'clock today and the information suggests he's going to plead to money laundering tax fraud failure to file foreign bank accounts violating the foreign agents Registration Act obstructing justice and lying to investigators what we don't know Stephanie is whether he has made any agreement to cooperate with Robert Muller's office or whether this is just simply an agreement to plead guilty to the charges to avoid a trial what he would get by pleading guilty is a possible sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility obviously he'd be in a position to get a greater sentence reduction if he chose to cooperate but given that donald trump has made noises about possibly intending to pardon Paul Manafort that remains up in the air Stephanie but the news here today is that Paul Manafort is going to walk into this courthouse and plead guilty to a host of felony charges in Washington DC okay and just to remind our audience Paul Manafort of course one-time campaign chair of Donald Trump right around the time when the RNC took place walk us through this the sentence that Paul Manafort has already been given in Virginia several weeks ago what does it do to that well it all comes together Stephanie in in the ultimate sentence that Paul Manafort will be handed he is facing under federal guidelines about seven to nine years on the felony conviction in Virginia recall that a jury hung on some counts convicted of several other felony counts and we learned from a juror in that Virginia case that they were one juror away from a unanimous conviction on all 18 counts against Paul Manafort so the evidence in that case was overwhelming arguably the evidence in the Washington DC case was even more overwhelming now if he had been convicted on all charges in the DC case the Sentencing Guidelines called for between ten and fifteen years and those Virginia and DC sentences would have been combined in some fashion not strung one after the other but combined essentially he's looking at as many as ten years which for a 69 year old man could be a life sentence it remains to be seen how this plea deal will affect his ultimate sentencing subject and I know you have limited information but try to help us understand this if he makes a plea deal without cooperating without cooperating means he has not flipped on the President or anyone else who may be tied to the president and the campaign if that is the case could we then draw a line to maybe there's some sort of joint defense agreement maybe there is a pardon in the president's pocket because as we've heard the president even in the last few weeks said give Paul Manafort credit for not being a guy who talks say he's a good guy who's gotten a raw deal well you raised a really good point rudy giuliani the president's lawyer said yesterday that there was a joint defense agreement between the president's lawyers and manna forts lawyers if manna fort was cooperating that agreement would have to cease now we don't know it could have ceased as of an hour ago we just don't know at this point but if he does plead guilty without any cooperation agreement many people will infer that he believes he has a chance of getting a pardon from the president because he would be looking at a long prison stretch as we said a potential life sentence for a 69 year old man he could die in prison it's hard to believe that he would just accept that without cutting the best deal he could unless he thought there was a chance that the president would either pardon him or commute his sentence Stephanie hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
