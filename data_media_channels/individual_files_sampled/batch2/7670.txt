Politico and morning consult did a poll to see how taxpayers are feeling about these new tax cuts are they noticing a difference in their check and if they have noticed a difference how much money are they making well here are the results they found that when polling employees in general 37% have noticed an uptick in their pay stubs but 53% say they haven't now let's break it down a little bit based on political ideology Republicans were more likely to say that they noticed a change in their paycheck so for instance about 32 percent of Republicans said yes I haven't I have enjoyed a little bit of an increase in pay but with Democrats it was about 21 percent with independence 22 percent so the point is the vast majority of Americans actually have not seen an increase in their pay following these massive pay cuts tax cuts now our polling shows high-income earners are more likely to have noticed an increase in their paychecks that's because those tax cuts were for those high income earners not for the middle class and certainly not for the working-class 45% of voters support the law enacted late last year and 35% oppose it the remaining 19 percent are undecided or have no opinion first of all when I read that the high income earners have noticed the tax cuts I literally said while reading the article of course the top 1% get a tax cut of over $50,000 I think they're gonna notice the $50,000 Paul Ryan was bragging that some of his constituents got a dollar 25 extra per week or per month or something like that you might miss the dollar 25 even if it exists and the one thing that's discouraging is that we live in different realities you either got the tax cut or you didn't but Democrats look out and go I didn't get it Republicans are gonna go I think I got it I know I know by the way in this case I don't know which one is right it might be the Democrats got it and I hate Trump so much they're purposely not seeing it consciously or it might be that the Republicans polled are higher earners and the Democrats that are polled right like I don't I mean those red states are pretty poor so I'm not sure about California in New York pretty rich and independents agree with Democrats meaning Democrats are more likely to be right but not not definitively anyway so if it keeps going like those the overall numbers of it being more popular than unpopular will flip when they realize it was just for the rich what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
