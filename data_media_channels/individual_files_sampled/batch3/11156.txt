UK's Prime Minister Teresa Mays been forced to justify a controversial decision to join the US and France in striking Syria without seeking the approval of MPs first the intervention against the SADS government has led to a lengthy and impassioned discussion in Parliament it is right that Parliament has the power to support or stop the government from taking planned military action a significant body of information including intelligence open-source accounts states that barrel bombs were used to deliver the chemicals mr. speaker does for example the humanitarian crisis in Yemen in title other countries to arrogate to themselves the right to bomb Saudi airfields especially given their use of banned cluster bombs and white phosphorus regrettably we had no choice but to conclude that diplomatic action on its own is not going to work it is clear that diplomatic and non-military means have not been fully exhaustive will be not just following orders from America we have acted because it is in our national interest Prime Minister is accountable to this Parliament not to the whims of the US president so I have a simple question to ask my rideable friend given the confusion of some who are a bit uncertain about who is the greatest threat to world peace does she think that it is Russia or America but can I say to my right honourable friend this was the first session where Prime Minister Theresa May had to face Parliament after she went ahead with the airstrikes on Saturday alongside the US and France and she was grilled the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn here demanded that she published the legal basis for carries of those airstrikes Theresa May says that she had actually consulted with the Attorney General and she gave this reason as to why she couldn't share that evidence for the rest of Parliament this was a limited targeted strike on a legal basis that has been used before and it was a decision which required the evaluation of intelligence and information much of which was of a nature that could not be shared with Parliament Jeremy Corbyn asked additional questions he pointed out that Theresa May had said that the targets were specifically housing chemical weapons and actually he said that two of the facilities had already been inspected by the OPCW in relation to the airstrikes against Baz I and him since our facilities the Prime Minister will be aware that the OPCW carried out inspections on both those facilities in 2017 and concluded I quote that the inspection team did not observe any activities inconsistent with obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention Jeremy Corbyn also questioned to resume saying that it was highly likely that the Assad regime was behind those chemical attacks he said that rebel group jaj al-islam had also used chemical weapons in the past and he called her decision legally questionable there seem to be a lot of unhappy MPs because she actually went ahead with her decision to carry out those airstrikes without consultation Adira to develop our team in the UK well the UK's Mail on Sunday newspaper meantime has published a poll revealing the British public was overwhelmingly opposed to the Prime Minister's decision to bypass Parliament and a YouGov survey conducted before the attack found that less than a quarter of the British public supported military action almost twice as many people were opposed to the operation as in favor of it there have been anti-war protests this Monday evening outside and over the assault from their ISA rally next just accept intelligence from this government after they played so many times in Iraq that was bombed that they claimed was was a biological weapons manufacture ingre that the baby milk production was only a cover it was a baby made factory to go to war to make that sort of decision without presenting the evidence it makes fools of us all it is basically immoral the whole point of having a democracy is that they're consulted over anything is serious this war and I think basically the government are just covering up they don't have any evidence and I think the majority of people in this country don't believe what the government is saying the British prime minister does not have to seek approval of Parliament but it's become of recent convention since the problems and the Iraq war that people do go to parliament and ask for these things I think she should not have running into this but she may have been pushed into by America and she has to to support our ally and you know there are many things to be weed but to be honest with you I don't think it's good i dint be better talking the Americans out of doing what they're doing at the moment
