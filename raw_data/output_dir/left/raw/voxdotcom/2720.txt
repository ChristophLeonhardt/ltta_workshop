1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,200
sit on this curvy couch

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,120
and deliver a bizarre mix of internet conspiracy theories,

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,020
Sharia law is now changing everything.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,240
general absurdity,

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,660
Nickelodeon is pushing a global warming agenda.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,820
And whatever the hell is going on here.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,000
It's the Fox show that's so bad
you can't help but laugh at it.

8
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,011
Can we get a stick?

9
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,870
Anybody got a stick?

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,080
What a bunch of dopes.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,830
It's all a lot of fun.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,690
Or at least it used to be.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,000
Because now, these three geniuses
are some of President Trump's

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,530
most trusted advisers.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,590
Fox & Friends in the morning,
they're very honorable people.

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,870
That's not coming from me,
that's coming from Trump,

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,860
who recently called Fox & Friends
one of the most influential shows in news.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,340
And the scary thing is
he's not wrong.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,020
Right now I'm getting my daily intelligence
briefing.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,940
Oh, from who?

21
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,440
From you guys.

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,820
To truly understand the magic of Fox & Friends,
you need to watch it every single day.

23
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,329
But my therapist says I'm not allowed to do
that anymore,

24
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,429
so I got someone who is.

25
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,009
Did you know there's seven days of Fox & Friends.

26
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,040
A lot of people think it's only five days.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,580
No, there's a weekend edition too.

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,580
It's a lot.

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,030
It's a lot of Fox & Friends.

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,030
This is Matt Gertz.

31
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,499
He's a research fellow
at a progressive media watchdog group

32
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:20,799
called Media Matters.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,980
Full disclosure:
He also used to be my boss, so.

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,700
Well, this is awkward.

35
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:31,320
On the morning of October 10, 2017,
Gertz noticed something weird happening.

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,929
Trump tweeted this, at 8 o'clock in the morning,
praising a book by a little-known conservative

37
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,179
author, seemingly out of nowhere.

38
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,590
So I thought that was weird.

39
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,770
One of my colleagues pointed out to me
that the author had actually been on Fox & Friends

40
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,979
earlier that morning.

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,399
His colleague was right.

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,569
Trump seemed to be responding
to a Fox & Friends segment about the book

43
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,829
that had aired that morning.

44
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,770
So I looked at all the tweets from that morning.

45
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,329
I had pretty good matches.

46
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,579
Fox & Friends talked about the NFL protests.

47
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,219
Three minutes later, Trump tweeted about the
NFL protests.

48
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,819
Fox & Friends criticized Democrats over immigration.

49
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,770
Trump tweeted about Democrats and immigration.

50
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,669
I said, "Well, damn.

51
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,259
He's watching the show and tweeting about
what he sees."

52
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,380
Gertz started tracking every time
a Fox & Friends segment lined up with a Trump tweet.

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,480
And he found a ton of examples.

54
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,510
Fox & Friends goes after Andrew McCabe.

55
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,540
So does Trump.

56
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,790
Fox & Friends talks about protests in Iran.

57
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,950
So does Trump.

58
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,239
Fox & Friends talks about Trump's mental fitness.

59
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,590
And, yeah.

60
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,629
The list goes on and on.

61
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,269
Sometimes Trump copies language directly
from what he sees on screen,

62
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,959
quoting Fox & Friends chyrons verbatim.

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,930
Other times, he tags Fox & Friends in his
tweet.

64
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,930
I counted over 50 examples of him doing this
since his inauguration

65
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,840
because I need a hobby.

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
If you look at the frequency of Trump's tweets
in 2017,

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,060
there's a spike between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock
AM,

68
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,750
which is Fox & Friends' time slot.

69
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,799
And Fox & Friends has noticed, too.

70
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,580
They now casually joke
about the president watching them live.

71
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,230
When I asked the president to
blink the lights on and off if he's watching...

72
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,890
And because they know he's watching,
Fox & Friends has evolved from

73
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,390
a show that

74
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,620
to a show that

75
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,560
actively trying to influence his behavior.

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,150
A Vox study of 17 months of Fox & Friends
transcripts

77
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,340
found that, after the election,
sentences aimed at instructing or advising

78
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,500
Trump spiked by more than 50 percent.

79
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I think the next thing the president should
do

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,659
is start doing some infrastructure.

81
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,689
That same study found that the show was using
more language aimed at changing the president's

82
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:29,680
behavior; phrases like "we need to," "we are going,"

83
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
and "we have got."

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,310
What does the president need to do,
if he's listening this morning,

85
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,660
to change the narrative?

86
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,620
Jesus, how is this even real?

87
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Okay, power through.

88
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,069
You saw this feedback loop in full effect
during the debate over the recent FISA bill.

89
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,819
In early January, Republicans were widely
in support

90
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,620
of reauthorizing a sweeping
government surveillance measure,

91
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,051
and the White House had publicly
come out in support of it.

92
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:54,540
But on January 11, Fox & Friends ran this
segment,

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,430
warning that the bill could be used to spy
on Trump officials.

94
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,420
At one point during the segment,
Andrew Napolitano turns to the camera and says:

95
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,980
Mr. President, this is not the way to go.

96
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,999
You can probably guess what happens next.

97
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:11,379
Trump sends a tweet criticizing the bill,
literally quoting the caption of the Fox & Friends

98
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,709
segment, Republicans on the Hill spend several hours

99
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,540
panicking. It is a bit of a confusing morning, to say

100
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
the least.

101
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,130
and two hours later
Trump backtracks, saying he still supports

102
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,130
the bill.

103
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,660
When asked if Fox & Friends got to Trump,
press secretary Sarah Sanders decides

104
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,440
to make fun of CNN instead.

105
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,100
I'm sure you're disappointed he's not watching
CNN.

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,680
Ooooh!

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,340
All of this has given Fox & Friends
incredible power to

108
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,290
to talk about sideshows that would otherwise
never escape the Fox News bubble.

109
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,500
What you have is Fox & Friends doing stories,
the president tweeting about what he's seeing,

110
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,410
and the rest of the media going,
"The president just tweeted this bizarre thing,

111
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,600
now we need to talk about this."

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,540
Trump watches a dumb segment
about missing FBI texts,

113
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,250
tweets about it,
and it becomes the top story of the day.

114
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,010
Trump watches a dumb segment about
the British spying on him,

115
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,080
repeats the claim in public,
and sparks an international crisis.

116
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,960
That was a statement made by a very talented
lawyer on Fox.

117
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,300
That's a lot of power in the hands of a show
that's known for getting things wrong.

118
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,230
A show that peddles wild internet conspiracy
theories,

119
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,830
Secret society, the missing texts,
it all adds up.

120
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,540
embraces paranoid fear-mongering,

121
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,540
What, we'll annihilate North Korea after we're dead?

122
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,780
I mean, we have to do something now.

123
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,200
and launches smear campaigns

124
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,700
against Trump's political opponents.

125
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,480
Bob Mueller, we now know, is totally conflicted.

126
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,420
Jim Comey is totally conflicted.

127
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,440
It is a carnival of chaos.

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,540
These are not the people that you want doing
the show that the president of the United States

129
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,820
is watching every morning.

130
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,360
Unfortunately, we don't have much of a choice.

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,590
Fox & Friends has spent years being treated
like a big joke.

132
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,220
But thanks to Trump,
these three might be the ones who get the

133
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,980
last laugh.

134
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,560
While we were shooting this episode,
Fox & Friends posted a job opening for a head writer.

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,040
They’re looking for somebody with a passion
for current events and accuracy.

136
00:05:58,050 --> 00:00:00,000
So, it’s been fun, Vox,
but it’s time for me to follow my dreams.
