Republicans take it away mainstream media that breaking news coming out of Alabama this morning a stunning end to the race for Senate as Doug Jones claims victory while his opponent Roy Moore says things are far from over Senate race against Republican Roy Moore this is a seismic Democratic victory in a deeply red state we have team coverage with reporters in both camps tonight Democrat Doug Jones wins a stunning victory in the Senate election in Alabama and tonight I'm Don Lemon thank you for staying up with us an incredible victory for the Democratic candidate in one of the reddest of red states I want you to listen to this joyful reaction at Doug Jones headquarters seismic stunning miraculous thank you for staying up with us I am truly a masochist that is like the cat of nine tails whipping myself watching that ridiculous coverage so that's that's gonna be the story seismic stunning unbelievable the whole it's all brand-new world huzzah has a you're near that from the mainstream media unfortunately a lot of Republicans are taking this to heart and they're taking away the wrong conclusions from this race so let's go through the top seven takeaways from Roy Moore's defeat in Alabama what conservatives should really learn number one no Roy Moore should not have dropped out of this race after the sexual impropriety allegations came out they said there are a lot of Republicans saying now I should have dropped out there should have been a write-in candidate against Doug Jones we could have run Luther strange or mo Brooks or somebody not true totally ridiculous let's look at the timeline on November 9th that is when the first allegations against Roy Moore came out keep in mind these are 40 year old allegations but on November 9th we learned that there is a woman who says that when she was 14 Roy Moore sexually inappropriate with her see sexually assaulted her and then a number of other women came out and said oh yes when I was 16 or 18 or 19 Roy Moore then at the time 30 32 he got a little frisky with me he too and it created this aura of sexual harassment and sexual assault those were the allegations these allegations were conveniently timed you notice you haven't heard about these things for I don't know the 40 years since they happened until just too late for Roy Moore to get off that ballot so people think it's very easy if Roy Moore just dropped out then they put someone else on the ballot and the Republican would have won that isn't true according to Alabama state code you can only remove yourself from the ballot 676 days before the election so if it's after that time period you can't get off of the ballot if more had dropped out his name would still be on that ballot he still would have the Republican line some people also don't know when you're running for office you need to get a number of lines so for instance when I would run campaigns in New York we try to pick up the Republican line the conservative line the Independence Party line they're always doing the Democrats would get working families party but you get those lines and then the more lines you have the better your chances of winning if were wrong or had dropped out and the Republican establishment or Donald Trump even had endorsed someone like Luther Strange who had lost in the primaries or mo Brooks who didn't really have much of a shot even though those candidates would have been more likely to win the general they would have had to be a write-in campaign so there's a very low chance that would have happened I think Luther strangers polling it like 2% or something in a write-in campaign in general election Roy Moore dropping out would have guaranteed the seat would have gone to a Democrat instead of what we saw which was a tight race but you know two or three points separating these it was a clear outcome basically but at least a close race dropping out would have guaranteed it to Democrats and I know what you're gonna hear you're gonna hear well Lisa Murkowski the senator from Alaska she won a write-in campaign in 2010 it is completely different she had a lot of things going for her one she had enormous support which Roy Moore she was an incumbent she already had the seat she or he had universal name recognition she came from a political legacy family she was widely known as the heir to a political family and she had a political right in campaign campaign so her entire campaign was about this right and she gave out bracelets she instructed people on how to spell her name it was just too late there was a month till the election when these allegations surfaced it couldn't have happened added to all of this you had Steve ban and inserting himself into the Roy Moore campaign and playing it as an anti establishment versus establishment campaign so had Donald Trump come out and endorsed the guy who lost the Republican primary or someone else it would have been seen widely as opposing the will of voters opposing the will of the populous and for a populist president to do that it just can't happen at the end of this election it was a choice between Roy Moore and Doug Jones anybody who's trying to tell you otherwise is selling you a fantasy number two no the outcome is not stunning the mainstream media will tell you it's stunning it's unbelievable to hear them tell it not since the Battle of Lepanto has an underdog overcome so much to get a victory NBC News reported it's a stunning victory Politico reported on the Alabama earthquake the Washington Post democracy dies in darkness called it miraculous they're suggesting no one could have ever predicted this this is a blowout victory hmm did anybody predict that Roy Moore would lose the general let's cut to the tape Luther will definitely win no you know what I'm saying Roy has a very good chance of not winning in the general election it's all about the general don't forget we don't stop here you have an election coming up the day this is over so this is over a Tuesday on Wednesday morning the new race begins you got to be a Democrat Luthor's gonna win easily and Roy's gonna have a hard time winning Oh Donald Trump Donald Trump is the guy who predicted this right the leader of Roy Moore's party the Republican president he predicted that Roy Moore would have a very hard time he likely wouldn't win the general election the mainstream media are conveniently ignoring this today because they need this to seem like a seismic shift they need this to show that all of the Republican momentum all of the Trump momentum conservative policy legislation like we haven't seen in our lifetimes is coming to an end they have to show that it stops that Donald Trump predicted it during the primary said yeah I don't know this guy it's a tough it's gonna be a tough race for him he isn't a great candidate he's a flawed candidate this was before any of the sexual allegations came out just based on his appeal as a candidate absent the dirty tricks absent people coming out of the woodwork to accuse him of things he knew it would be a tough race this isn't stunning stop repeating that number three Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment now more than ever Ronald Reagan was fine of saying there is an 11th commandment we all must live by thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican unfortunately many Republicans were all too happy to jump on the bandwagon against Roy Moore when these accusations came out in part perhaps because the going got a little tough that's a that is a bad accusation to say that a man in his 30s is creeping on fourteen-year-old girls and so when the going gets tough you want to run away from that also I think people just don't like more a lot of some Republicans don't like him because of his Trump eNOS something they don't like him because he's a bible-thumper they don't like him because he seems a little slick a little unctuous whatever do not speak ill of a fellow Republican because by the way their this sexual mania that took over the last days of the Roy Moore campaign they had one piece of solid evidence they had one piece of solid evidence Gloria Allred showed it off with that one accuser during her big press conference it was a yearbook that purported to have a signature from Roy Moore saying sweet things to the little girl we now know it has been admitted that that evidence was at least partially fabricated and they hid that it was fabricated when they showed it so the only hard evidence we have is not credible and yet Republicans were quick to throw Roy Moore under the bus instead of saying nothing at all and sort of spent stepping back a little bit and saying well let's wait and see how this plays out I'm not totally sure because now there's a precedent which is if you make allegations sexual allegations in particular against a Republican you will be assumed guilty until proven innocent not a good way for Republicans to move forward it really damages us hopefully we'll learn not to be so quick on the trigger in the future number four Republicans need better opposition research this is the part where I talk about how the allegations were pretty strong so these allegations sure they were 40 years old but we know from Moore's autobiography that he has a thing for young teenage girls we know from Moore's 2005 autobiography that he met his current wife when she was a teenager performing in a dance recital he wrote quote I knew Kayla was going to be a special person in my life and then later when she was 23 I think they connected and went on a date that's how the story goes nevertheless he even admitted that when she was a teenage girl in a dance recital he had the eye for her so Roy Moore's opponents should have known his Republican opponent should have known this was a place ripe for attack even if all of the allegations were false they would be easy political tricks to play they should have run Moore's campaign should have protected against that and Luther Strange's campaign should have pounced on it if these allegations are true they should have found those people and they should have made them make the claims during the primaries so that strange would have won and we would have a Republican in the Senate from Alabama if they if those claims weren't true Roy Moore should have protected against that it means that Luther strangers campaign was confident I don't believe this was a big conspiracy really by the establishment I don't really buy that Mitch McConnell knew about this and he was sitting on it and hiding it I think if they had been sitting on it they would have played it in the primary they don't want to lose that seat they could have easily bumped out Roy Moore and given it to Luther strange if this had come out Republican voting was deeply depressed in the general election they easily could have defeated Roy Moore in a primary and depressed his supporters in that election but they didn't do it I don't know if it's that we're lazy because we've been running against the Clintons who for whom every scandal of the last three decades is common public knowledge it's been plastered all over TV for years and years and years but you have to get better at opposition research I place a lot of the blame for this loss at Luther strangers feet and at his campaign because they didn't uncover this and more didn't protect against it number five do not OD on Kofi Kofi Fay is a hell of a drug folks you've got to use it sparingly and cautiously what I mean by that there is a huge right-wing exuberance more than I have ever seen in my entire life a young life granted but you know I've been on this earth a few decades at least and we've never seen anything like this wonderful conservative legislation wonderful executive priorities wonderful foreign policy good judges being nominated courts being stacked we're seeing massive tax reform that we haven't seen since Reagan but there is a limit there is a limit you can't go crazy Donald Trump has completely shaken up politics he's radically altered what is acceptable specifically in political speech in campaign speech in what a candidate looks like he's cracked this political correct gross just the political language where they say one thing and really you know that they're lying but they're lying in this way or they're lying in that way Donald trunk he cracked that he cracked the political correctness he cracked the credibility of the mainstream media but you can't get away with everything he hasn't abolished the rules of politics entirely Roy Moore did not have a way forward he did not know how to pivot his campaign he gave this awful interview with Sean Hannity let's hear it you know miss Coffman do you know the mother I don't know your scorpion from anybody I never talked to her and they've had any contact with her allegations of sexual misconduct with her completely false I believe they're politically motivated I believe they're brought only to stop a very successful campaign and that's what they're doing I've never known this woman or anything with regard to the other girls you understand this was 40 years ago she said that you asked her out on the first of several dates but nothing progressed beyond kissing I don't remember specific dates not do not and I don't remember if it was that time or later but I do not remember that but you know her but you never dated her ever is that what you're saying no her but I don't remember going out on dates I knew her as a friend if we did go out on dates and we did but I do not remember that that is not an answer so he's talking about two different girls there but he's saying on the one that's never happened this fourteen-year-old girl it never happened well did you date teenagers well no I don't I don't remember specific dates well did you date teenagers well you know I that's not an answer if you're gonna deny it deny it if you're gonna own up to it own up to it and explain it but move on pivot move on the way that Roy Moore tried to pivot was by blaming gays and lesbians and the cultural left for harping on this sure the cultural left might be harping on this you're not going to be able to push your campaign forward by trying to scapegoat gays and lesbians when your own sexual behavior is being called into question you have to move forward Roy Moore didn't do that he didn't have a clear enough vision for his campaign and he didn't have the courage or the strength or the political smarts to address the issue and move straight forward plow right by it this brings us to number six never defend never explain always attack this is also from Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan would say if you're explaining you're losing but Roy Moore just kept on explaining he kept on saying well I never this forty years ago and even when I did I got the mother's permission that doesn't work pal when you do that you you end up looking like Frank from Always Sunny in Philadelphia I am NOT gonna duel your kids I'm not like that we got to definitely write a song about how we do not diddle kids do not diddle kids it's no good diddling kids there's no quicker way for people to think that you are diddling kids than by writing a song about it you gotta race always just says oh I wouldn't do it with anybody younger than my daughter that could be a documentary of Rome worst campaign that is what it looked like when he came out and ready to explain all of this don't do that eventually he wised up and then just denied it he called into question some of the clearly the fabrication on the yearbook signature but that's what he looked like four weeks when these allegations came out not a good look there's no way to convince somebody that you're not doing that when you're constantly harping on these things and going back and changing your story slightly when Republicans were confronted with various and sundry allegations against Moore they would say if you even support more you are a pedophile there is a two-word answer that they should have given Bob Menendez Bob Menendez there is a sitting Democrat United States Senator who federal prosecutors think might have had sex with underage prostitutes you don't hear a peep about that you don't hear Democrats calling on him to step down or to resign the mainstream media have blocked it out entirely because it doesn't help out their narrative against Republicans and against Roy Moore but that's what they said the Democrats said well if you vote for Moore you are a pedophile and just to be precise about language here what Roy Moore is accused of is not pedophilia it the old Greek word for this is if he Buffy Leah he's accused of doing things weird sex stuff with teenagers young teenage girls but not with children there's a difference between a six year old and a 16 year old for instance I guess you could make that point to them but the real attack you have to make is pushing forward pushing it back on them say not only are your claims not true not only is your evidence of the yearbook which was fabricated not even is that not credible but your own guy is sitting in the United States Senate accused of having sex with underage prostitutes Senator Bob Menendez and you're saying nothing on that and until Democrats answer for that they have no credibility on this issue and you don't owe them one single explanation beyond that political votes are when I vote for somebody I do not suddenly take on all of their moral characteristics that's not how it works we live in reality and in reality we have to elect people to represent us on political issues in legislative bodies I do not become Chuck Schumer because Chuck Schumer represents the state of New York I do not become Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris represents California I don't even become Donald Trump because I voted for Donald Trump in the presidential election I had I don't have billions of dollars I don't have the kind of crazy hair none that doesn't happen because there are steps between the representatives and their constituents don't buy into that lie and hammer them hammer them hammer them have I made myself clear I hope so next and final point do not get hypnotized this one's really hard because the mainstream media will do this to you according to a report out from the media Research Center today 91 percent of evening news coverage about Donald Trump is negative 91 percent this is way higher than previous presidents Republican or Democrat there is wall-to-wall coverage of all of the sex stuff with Roy Moore and what's the refrain Roy Moore is a pedophile Roy Moore is a pedophile doesn't really analyze the evidence it doesn't analyze what those words mean it doesn't analyze what the accusations or how many decades ago they took place but do not be hypnotized I know you haven't seen anything about Bob Menendez I know all you've heard of that is what a mean terrible rotten guy Roy Moore is but the mainstream media or the communications wing of the Democratic Party do not believe what they're saying there have been absurd retractions in just the last few days from CNN Washington Post the New York Times they got stories completely wrong important stories important stories about so called collusion about the White House about Donald Trump don't buy what they are selling and don't buy their premises because then you'll have to arrive at their conclusions that isn't true okay that's all I want to talk about on how conservatives are making wrong conclusions from this race now we have to talk about the race itself we have to bring on our lovely panel of deplorable zaur all-female panel the conservative millennial Ally Stuckey and the Daily wires very on a man to press to giacomo but first you didn't I wasn't going to just give them to you all willy-nilly without having to talk to you

in the Senate mean for tax reform well unfortunately I don't think it's a great set for tax reform I do think the positive side about it although you have already touched on this so far is that we don't have such an uphill PR battle now to fight of course everyone who voted for president Trump won and someone in the Senate that would carry out president Trump's pro America America first agenda and that includes tax reform but I do think it's a positive that we no longer have to battle the media and battle the left and defend ourselves as you explained we would constantly be having to explain ourselves by saying oh no we're not the party of a sex offender or no we're not the party of a guy who engages in preying upon teenagers that's what how we would be spending the next couple years until until 2020 is explaining that we are not the party of moremore well now we don't have to waste our time doing that we can actually focus on maintaining the majority in the Senate and then winning 2020 as well so I do think it can be a positive and it does take a real weapon out of their toolbox absolutely I always advocate explaining anything to them and saying we don't owe you an explanation you have Bob Menendez but you're right it does make it much easier on the PR front and it really was the worst night for Al Franken al franken who think resigned a couple weeks ago he now has to actually resign and you know if Roy Moore had won he could say well he they got more I'm gonna stay but too bad now you're fired sad sad I Donald Trump's catchphrase so I suppose it's fitting Amanda what does this mean for Republicans in 2018 well I think I think we can just learn that this was a really bad candidate like I don't think this teaches us anything else aside from Roy Moyer was a really bad candidate and that's why I lost like I don't think we can extrapolate from this and think it's like a referendum on Trump or anything like that I just think we put not a good candidate forward I mean mo Brooks would have wiped the floor even though they're strange so it was really and of course we can look to Mitch McConnell and that was not the best move on his part to try to rid those other people from being in there so maybe just take a look at our leadership that would be a good move for Republicans and then maybe that would help us in 2018 he was a bad candidate I do fear now that anybody can make up allegations I'm not saying these allegations are made up but anybody can make them up especially if they're four decades old and giving them a win on this I just fear is going to unleash a tidal wave of these allegations are we gonna see this strategy played out in 2018 a 100% I've had reservations about the whole me to campaign from the beginning and this is and that's exactly the right point is that anything can be said Bill O'Reilly actually just recently came out and he said that there's a tape again I can't you know I don't know if this is true or not but he said that there's the tape of basically an anti-trump attorney offering two hundred thousand dollars to someone to make up false sexual assault accusations against President Trump to say that this one never happened is absurd and we've seen it in the past so it's it's a really dangerous precedent again not to say that the allegations against were more were false we I don't know some of them seem credible actually but we could see this in the future where you could you know tank a candidate based off of allegations true or not like I said we didn't even get to the bottom of these and and the outcome of that election was it was clear as day that he wasn't gonna win because of the allegations and really really dangerous Chuck Schumer today reported to Capitol Police that there was a plot afoot to accuse him of sexual assault or sexual harassment that that weren't true you know it was just made up and cooked up in some political operatives room I thought well aren't we always supposed to believe the women though what happened to Chuck Schumer what happened to woke Jack Alex well I think that I think that's a really good point may think the danger of Democrats employing this kind of strategy going forward yes it could be effective to taking down Republicans but as they've seen it's also effective in taking down Democrats and so if they're willing to take down their own side by taking down people like Al Franken and John Conyers and maybe even Chuck Schumer who knows not starting that rumor but hey I'm not starting that rumor that Chuck Schumer is gonna get taken down by weird sex time I'm sorry out there we do have to believe a woman right so I think that they have to be willing to turn that sword on themselves if that's the sort that they want to die on I think that what they're doing is that they realize that they're gonna take down some of their own by spearheading this whole me to movement and how they kind of remedied that and how they kind of solve that and is is by using Al Franken as the guy who fell on his sword as the scapegoat that said yes we're even going to call out some of our own but when we call out some of our own look what they do they resign this is how whorl we are we are willing to throw away some of her own and stand for the principle of morality our principle of against sexual harassment which I don't think that's a really moral stance at all I think it's politically expedient but if they are willing to continue to do that and continue to allow their congressmen who are accused of sexual assault to fall on their swords then we're not gonna have any Congress people anymore which I think would great didn't let the periods win yeah well that's true although I am sympathetic to Federalist 51 which says that the Congress exists so that all the sociopaths of the country can go into a room and fight one another and the Democrats they do seem to be much less morally concerned much less morally meticulous if you're the senator from New Jersey named Bob Menendez but who knows that's so strange I do want to make just before we sign off from Facebook and YouTube I do want to point out we are not starting the rumor that Chuck Schumer the senior senator from New York and the Democratic leader is a sexual predator we're not starting that rumor so don't don't you go around spreading that don't repeat it that Chuck Schumer is a sexual predator okay we've got a sign-off from Facebook in YouTube if you already subscribe to The Daily wire thank you very much it helps us keep the lights on cough fa in my cup it helps me recover on a horrible terrible mornings like this when Republicans lose Alabama so if you haven't subscribed go to daily we're calm right now what do you get well it's $9 or $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership you get me the Andrew Clavin show the ben shapiro show blah blah blah blah blah you get the leftist tears tumblr now I will grant you it's a little emptier this morning after Doug Jones's victory last night but look we got a lot more racist coming folks we have a lot more winning the house is moving very fast on tax reform so it's really probably just a matter of hours before this thing fills up again and we can lower tax rates cut the corporate tax and make America great again so so go to Daley wire.com get that leftist here's time alert right now we will be right back okay in the news this one really rings true for me a new study published in the journal International psycho geriatrics I could describe members of my family by the way psycho geriatrics it shows that the key to living a long life is being a stubborn old Italian woman the common personality traits that have helped a group of ninety to one hundred and one-year-old Italians is stubbornness hope and a love for family and country the lead author of the study went on quote we also found that this group tended to be domineering stubborn and needed a sense of control which can be a desirable trait as they are true to their convictions and care less about what others think get out of my grandmother's house what are you doing why are you recording there this is almost an anti scientific study it seems to me it's a scientific study that says that instead of listening to scientists you should just do what your Italian grandmother says Ali how seriously should we take this or any other supposedly scientific psychological study that promises us health and happiness yeah I mean obviously I think it's totally subjective and up to the individual I like this I like anti science science I think it's good science I think it's completely subjective how long people live I think probably the biggest factor that I see over and over again from scientists psychologists alike is that stress is a really big factor in how long people live I mean I have a grandfather for example who has smoked cigarettes and has drank his entire life and is in no way in good shape but he's lived a very long time and then I have other people in my family who have been the epitome of great health and have suffered health complications that had nothing to do with how they lived their life but the thing about my grandfather is is that he has been virtually stress free he is very content and who he is and in his life he leads a very simple life and I kind of think that's the common thread that we see throughout people who end up living a long time is kind of a lack of stress which we have not picked the right jobs I don't think she'll very long lives that is try try to get my requisite 14 hours of sleep a night but been always just comes back the door waking me up it's very difficult hostile work environment Amanda you are a future Italian grandmother why is it that these traits tend to lead to a long life I don't know but this this is like the most scientific thing because I'm basically the person that they're describing oh yeah I'm I think this is like 100 percent accurate I don't know I mean it's it's I guess it can be subjective like I was saying but I would like to believe that this is 100% real so I will live into a to 100 but like might might not for example she's like 87 like Evan of my family's lived to a very long life maybe maybe there's like also guilt that might also help someone live longer that's like a good trait for Italian so maybe made that too so do you want that's the question that I posed this panel of deplorable do you want to live to a hundred years old that's a hard one it depends if I can still smoke stogies and have a little Scotch in my glass then I think life is still worth living you know I'll enjoy the beautiful poetry of the world but my my own grandmother if she if I set her rage on the air she would she would come through that wall and murder me so I'll refrain from that she says it's 29 but she still goes out she chases the deer who eat her little flowers she chases them with a hose around her property this woman is tough as nails and yeah there is something to living a long time because you just refuse to let the world kill you good luck yeah I don't know if I would if I would want to do that I don't know if it's if it's necessarily the happiest you know 110 year old person who's just stubborn and frowning and angry at the world but I do like that a love of country is an aspect of this love of family and love of country there's something about enjoying the place that you are and the people that surround you that doesn't surprise me that they would want to stick around it's very real it's very tangible and it and you know it makes life worth living patriotism these tellers don't run if you want to a long time just love American we got to move on Republicans plan to accuse the Justice Department of bias after newly revealed text messages among FBI officials including some working on the Muller probe revealed extreme anti-trump bias and conspiracy last year just before the election FBI agent Peter struck I can't pronounce his name Peter Stern doc texted FBI lawyer Lisa Paige quote I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's meat office meaning FBI director Andrew McCabe that there's no way he meaning Trump gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take that risk it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before 40 ha ha ha that text was sent just weeks after the FBI investigation into Russian interference began meaning that the whole investigation appears to have begun as a political hit job to damage Trump is this a conspiracy Amanda is there a deep state conspiracy against Donald Trump I mean it's looking more like that a notice from the saying that it was a witch hunt and as the days pass it looks more and more increasingly like it is in which I mean these text messages it's not just that they happen to you know become a craft they happen to have a political view that that would be kind of expected it's that text that you just read where's the one almost like it was a conspiracy like they were going to take him down that is so so troubling and the whole point of the special counsel of his investigation is to read bias how in the world is this rating bias I mean Peter struck was just let go but I mean he had his hands in everything apparently he was like the only FBI agent and he's a very severe fire so it's like in the movies in the movies we all picture it's just like one guy doing everything that is Peter strode such a joke yeah it's really bad if the texts had just said trump what a jerk oh well I don't like him that's one thing but they're referring to meetings with the director of the FBI on ways to take Trump out very bad ally does the Mulder there's no evidence of collusion so that's also you know if we had some evidence of collusion maybe we can be like okay like just get rid of that guy and continue but where is the collusion well there's collusion between the Justice Department and the Hillary Clinton campaign that's the collusion there's no collusion between Trump and Russia Ali does Muller who employed both of these people in the text exchange who stacked his investigation with people who are against Donald Trump does Muller have any credibility left does this investigation have any credibility left I don't think so and I used to be under the camp that said okay we can't fire Moeller that's gonna be an absolute disaster but I think the more we learned about the potential of the conspiracy the more you really wonder if you should be in this place not the very least do we need to hire an investigation to investigate the investigation I mean I I think that's what the American people deserve and I think it's crazy just how much Trump continues to be vindicated in this kind of thing I mean every time he says some seemingly outlandish thing about that there's no Russian collusion and Obama wiretapped in and now the real collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI and all this it seems ridiculous at the time but it ends up that okay he might not have worded it correctly but he was actually right and I'm just wondering if the FBI thought that they were so savvy that this wasn't going to come out at any point that they were going to continue to spend this narrative of collusion and then it wasn't going to come back to bite it I think it just kind of shows how stupid they think the rest of the world is and the rest of the American people are and how stupid Trump and his cronies are that they were never going to figure something like this out and so I think it's going to be amazing and amazingly vindicating for all of us if at the end of this there's obviously no Russian collusion and the real collusion was with the Hillary Clinton camp it'll just be beautiful and that that hubris of the FBI is so outrageous pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall you jerks we got you ha ha ha next news story uh you know last week or two weeks ago maybe I got in trouble with lefties pretending to be offended they weren't really offended but they were pretending to be offended because I suggested that the massive fire that burned down Hollywood the one that torched my commute and made me broadcast from my apartment in front of my Christmas tree that that was evidence of God's unsubtle brushstroke you know there the physical reflecting the metaphysical the figurative in the sex scandal melting down Hollywood and then literally the same thing happening we now know the immediate cause of the fire that destroyed six homes and damaged two dozen others it was bums City officials have confirmed the start the fire rather was started by a cooking fire at a homeless encampment LA mayor Eric Garcetti who has completely failed to address the homeless crisis passed the buck saying quote you can never get to zero risk I think it would be a mistake to think we could all right Eric sure Amanda there are homeless people camping out all over the city why are there so many homeless people yeah well that's the thing they like instead of reflecting and being like okay this is a massive homeless problem let's address that maybe our policies aren't so aren't doing so hot we should change our economic policies no no I think the solution that I read and this is like legit is that they said they wanted to educate the homeless about these players like safety precautions for the homeless like why not try to make them not homeless but on that on that point of the homeless people it's true we need policies and incentives so that they can't live like bums for their lives but also that won't solve it for everybody the poor will always be with us and in the 1980s we closed down a lot of mental institutions during the Reagan administration actually because there were new psychotropic drug drugs that would address psychological conditions and then they would be better and these people didn't need to be locked up anymore trouble was they stopped taking the drugs when they got out and all of a sudden they were living in squalor again we do not take mental health seriously in the United States it's a touchy issue because we don't want to be able to commit people to institutions we want them to be free to live lives of misery and squalor and crime for themselves and society but that isn't compassionate and a huge proportion of homeless people have mental illnesses so we ought to take that seriously there's an there is nothing compassionate leftie politicians who think it's better to leave them on the street than to get them the care that they need even if it's involuntary and the road to hell is paved with good intentions ladies that is all the time we're actually running a little late it is
