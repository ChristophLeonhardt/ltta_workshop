in the latest evidence the media have lost their minds over the election of President Trump outlets all over the country went nuts over Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway putting her feet on a couch in the Oval Office while taking a photo of Trump with top officers at historically black colleges is what the picture looked like here's BuzzFeed's deputy news director shoes on the couch in the Oval Office here is certified nutjob Keith Olbermann get your effing feet off the furniture Kelly on pulse this isn't your home here is a digital organizer for Hillary Clinton Conway with her shoes on

Twitter freaks out New York Post Kelly and Conway kneels on oval office couch sparks debate The Telegraph from the UK shows some class Kelly and Conway accused of lacking respect after putting feet up on Oval Office couch oh no the horror Kelly Ann Connolly put her feet on the couch like a human even the Washington Post's Chris Chile's I got this one right he said quote this tempest in a teapot is in a word dumb in two words incredibly dumb of course julissa then goes on to get one thing wrong he equates Conway's conduct with that of President Clinton in the Oval Office which neglects a few facts first Kellyanne Conway is not the president second Bill Clinton's intern performed oral sex on him in the Oval Office Kellyanne Conway kneeling on a couch isn't quite the same thing as Monica Lewinsky kneeling under the desk or having sex on top of the oval office desk with Clinton as Secret Service members reported as for the generalized outrage on her feet on the furniture in the Oval Office President Obama routinely put his desk at his feet on the resolute desk a gift from Queen Victoria Victoria to President Rutherford B Hayes in 1890 but so did George W Bush and Gerald Ford in other words everybody needs to come to him if the biggest problem the media have with Kellyanne Conway is where she puts her feet in the Oval Office they are just awful at their jobs I'm Ben Shapiro

overreaching right now and the biggest advantage that Donald Trump has in the political debate is clearly the insanity of the media because he goes out there any bashes the media and everybody who is on the right side of the aisle implicitly loves this we all love this because the media have it coming for 20 years 20 long years 30 years I mean going all the way back to Ronald Reagan going back to Nixon the media have been far to the left and they have unfairly targeted Republicans like some targeting as fair some is not but the fact that Trump is striking back in the media it works well for him it works particularly well for him when the media continued to overreach and make themselves look insane the left and the media have decided the only way the left is going to regain power is simply by attacking Trump attacking Trump attacking Trump now I think what's in their mind is they think that they're gonna do to Trump what they did to george w bush they think that if they can just polarize bush enough to get nancy pelosi and obama in they can polarize Trump enough to get Cory Booker or Elizabeth Warren in in four years but this neglects a couple of facts first george w bush actually had to do some pretty bad things as president in order to lose his approval rating and watch it plummet presidents who have over a forty percent approval rating have a legit shot at re-election if you're below forty percent basically you're toast trump right now is anywhere from forty four to fifty percent and according to Rasmussen a little bit about fifty percent in terms of approval rating if he's six in that range he'll have a legit shot at re-election and in order for a president to really drop below that range he has to do something really bad and usually that means some sort of economic recession or a war that is prosecuted poorly George HW Bush George HW Bush was riding really high who's in like the 80s after the Gulf War and then there was an economic recession in clementa down into the 30s George W was in the 50s for the vast majority of his first term after 9/11 news in the 90s after the Iraq war he was in the 60s he basically spent most of his first term hovering around fifty five fifty six percent and then it was only after his re-election when the Iraq war really started to go south before the surge that his approval ratings dumped and tanked for the last time then there was a recession so he had the double whammy and he ended up in the 20s right now Trump isn't involved in any long-standing war you know Afghanistan is still going on but that's really not considered his war he hasn't started a war that's going badly and the economy's doing pretty well so long as those two things hold true attacking Trump isn't gonna do a lot for the media but that's not stopping them they think that if they just attacked Trump attacked Trump that will alleviate their responsibility to not suck at their jobs and if the left keeps attacking Trump they won't have to run Democrats who aren't insane so this is what you see from the media so Mika Brzezinski over at MSNBC she says the Trump is clearly trying to create a dictatorship again over the top spies are defended the decision to limit the press I think that we have shown in abundance of accessibility we brought more reporters into this process and the idea that every time that every single person can't get their question answer to fit in a room there including people we've actually gone above and beyond with making ourselves our team and our briefing room more accessible than probably any prior administration so I think you can take that to the bank it's that there's a different Spicer that we have for you back in December here he is we have a respect for the press when it comes to the government that that is something that you can't ban an entity from you know conservative liberal or otherwise I think that's what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship just let that marinate I mean so is that where we're at anybody want to participate I mean I is he's just described himself seventy days maybe a long time in his mind I'm not I'm not joking and I'm not angry okay I'm not joking around angry are they trying to create a dictatorship if they are this is the worst dictatorship ever okay honestly like I think people are right to be afraid of authoritarian presidents but so far everybody seems pretty able to criticize him and dictatorships usually don't have any code Burzynski on they're talking about how thick tater chip is being created as a typical matter and Brzezinski hasn't been banned from the air but again the media have to overreach because they think that if they destroyed Trump then they are going to destroy the Republican Party what they figure is that the Republican Party's seen a major upswing since 2010 thanks in large parts of Barack Obama they're dominant across the country in localities and States their dominance in the federal government but now they've tethered their wagon to Donald Trump so if they burn Donald Trump down the wagon will burn too so they're gonna focus all their fire on Donald Trump Chris Matthews doing the same thing he says I don't understand why would it why would anybody believe Trump after years of good math you have as he say get up come here they show come in here a wrinkle don't even know what I'm doing and then I just talk I say things and people watch it sometimes Tim it's NBC's and not too many people Kathleen what do you think go new said earlier evening news analysis and opinion he doesn't go after lefties he doesn't get their Center lefties he goes after people producing news on the front page hard-working enterprise reporting that's always going after have you noticed that's certainly the case here but you know here explain element here if you know he's picking it again looking for an enemy this is somebody has spent his entire career in negotiations you can't have a negotiation with one party I mean you can't have a super hero without a villain there's an element of like why would anybody believe Trump would Trump spend years saying that Barack Obama was an illegal alien his supporters believe it why would they believe when they know he was wrong about the big thing he ran on for five years why would they believe he's got some new truth coming out of him well the irony is that he has said that they hate Obama so much they'd love to have him you know trash by saying he's it's confirmation bias people believe what they want to believe get confirmation bias are you listening lefties who are watching Chris Matthews of our number sent me see it's confirmation bias you understand that's right you have a bias and everybody confirms the by I think if I sit here and I say it Donald Trump is the worst thing that ever was and people think it's news maybe that's because they already tell you is the worst thing that ever was that's confirmation bias but doesn't apply to makes them on the Left also I come over the show and I was like to eat soup with a strainer I don't know my then the media have decided they don't understand why it is that Trump has any credibility after all of this has happened here's the funny thing there's a poll yesterday from Wall Street Journal NBC News and what it found is that 52 percent of Americans think the media have gone overboard on Trump because they have again that Kellyanne Conway photos a great example of this the fact that the media have lost their mind over this photo of Kellyanne Conway with her feet on the couch it's just absurd it's just absurd and it demonstrates how far they're willing to go there is a strategy to it again the strategy is if you can polarize about Trump maybe take down the entire Republican Party because you figure the Trump is the figurehead for the Republican Party he's a really volatile figurehead and maybe you can maybe he's the anchor that drags down the Republicans it's not just the media obviously it's also the Democrats so Nancy Pelosi is out there too the Botox lady the Botox is now seeped into her neurological structures and she says that it's time to impeach Trump it's forty days and a symptom peach from but the administration was making this strong case with the American people and perhaps misrepresenting the American people could be cause for impeachment if so there's plenty of grounds right now with the current president but it just does isn't the case that doesn't mean nobody's listening to cases that are being made in a very scientific methodical way as to whether there are grounds for impeachment but the fact is is that many of we're trying to unite the country and many of the president's supporters are just not ready to accept the fact that that their judgment might not been is so great and voting for him and by the time the case is made perhaps they'll be ready to accept that yes clearly Democrats are ready to unite the country around impeaching Trump this is the same thing look Nancy Pelosi only has one speed and that speed is impeach bush impeach trump wouldn't matter it could have been Rubio could have in Romney would have been exactly the same case made by the Democrats Maxine Waters another one of these radical Democrats from California she says that Trump obviously colluded with Russia to steal the election by the way the same lady who said the LA riots were in LA uprisings when people were burning down storefronts owned by Koreans in South Central Los Angeles that was an uprising according to Maxine Waters she also said that Trump colluded with Russia here just say that my colleagues and the leadership would not like to hear me say that I word but I say it over and over again impeachment impeachment impeachment absolutely was in collusion with the Kremlin and Putin in Russia during the campaign I believe that I believe that they undermined our democracy by interfering with our election and I think that meets the criteria for impeachment I'm trying to get out is the connection of all of those around him with Russia and with the Kremlin and the fact that they're going for the oil that's why you hear a lot about lifting the sanction they're going for the oil what is she even talking about it should insane yeah she's an insane person actually the answer is yes she is a crazy person going for the oil oil prices aren't the lowest they've been in 20 years what is she saying going for the oil and when ever Maxine Waters appears on the show like this I'm just waiting for Jerry Springer to pop out and Britta say we're gonna take a paternity test here on this particular show of math scene waters in any case the Democrats have decided that that Donald Trump is is impeachable and again this is part of a broader strategy now Chuck Schumer has a bit of a different strategy and I'll get to Chuck Schumer strategy in a little bit but first we have to say thank you to our advertisers over at Birch gold so if you are somebody who's looking at the economy and figuring to yourself well things are really good but maybe they'll go south

my friends over at birchgold.com slash bet now here's the thing the Democrats are turning Trump into the enemy and this has been their strategy not just with Trump or with Bush but it's been going back for really the entirety of the time pretty much the entire 20th century the Democrats have made this case the case they've made is that Democrats are fighting the enemy and the enemy are these these evil Republicans who want to stand in the way of progress and their racist sexist picket homophobes and their people who don't they don't agree with the with the greatness of American government and their John Lithgow and Footloose and they want to stop Kevin Bacon from dancing and all the rest of it right there's always been the pitch Republicans are the enemy and Republicans for most of the twentieth century made the case that the real enemy were the Soviets right the Communists the International communists were the were the greatest threat to American security and most of the time Americans looked at the Soviet Union and they said right that's a bigger threat than the Republicans and that's why you end up with President Eisenhower and President Nixon and President Reagan because Americans generally believed the Republicans when they said your enemy is the is the Russians your enemy is the Soviets they didn't believe Democrats as much when the Democrats said your enemy is the Republicans then the Soviet Union Falls and basically Republicans don't win presidential elections right they they win one too popular presidential elections since the one since the fall of the Soviet Union in the popular vote they've won one popular presidential election in 2004 and that was a real act right because Bush lost the popular vote in 2000 and Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 basically the case the Democrats have made is still the same case Republicans are the enemies of the American people and Republicans have sort of picked a variety of enemies it's been you know the it's been the radical Muslims or it's been the Chinese or it's been the Russians and the case of Mitt Romney they pick enemies and the American people go WOW are they really so scary are they really so scary so the only time that worked was in 2004 when the answer was yes they really are that scary radical Islamic terrorism could actually kill Americans it does the only time that worked a lot of elections take place under the rubric of whose enemies do you most want to fight whose enemies do you most want to fight so you must want to fight Republicans or you most want to fight the Russians or the Chinese now the thing about Trump right now is that the Democrats are saying that the great enemy is Trump Trump is the enemy the same case they've always made it's the Republicans and Trump they're the enemy Donald Trump has another series of enemies and those enemies are pretty popular people don't like those enemies very much so Donald Trump for example he really hates the press it turns out Americans really don't like the press attacking the press is a good enemy for Donald Trump Donald Trump has his own set of enemies good see here's Donald Trump saying yesterday he doesn't want to do the White House Correspondents Dinner because hey the media is terrible a lot of the stories are made up I believe a lot of the stories of pure fiction they just pull it out of air now with all of that being said I just thought it would be better if I didn't do the dinner that doesn't mean I'm not going to do that this year but I just thought it would be better if I didn't do this okay so the media are his enemies the media are you know in the public view the media are not our friends right there also are enemies in many ways and this is why the media publicity there they're sort of approval ratings are very low actually much lower than President Trump sounds from says your enemies are the Democrats the Democrats approval ratings right now are far below those of President Trump Trump says Barack Obama is the enemy Americans approval rating for Obamacare is really not very good here's Donald Trump saying that Obama is behind the recent protests against a lot of things he's trying to do we talked about President Obama you said you personally get along with them you guys are going at each other for three or four maybe eight years it turns out his organization seems to be doing a lot of the organizing so some of the protests and all of these Republicans are seeing around the country and against you do you believe President Obama is behind it and if he is is that a violation of the the call so called unsaid president's code no I think he is behind it I also think it's politics that's the way it is and look I have never but Bush wasn't going after Clinton Clinton was going after Bush well you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes you know you're probably right or possibly right but you never know no I think that President Obama is behind it because his people certainly behind it and some of the leaks possibly come from that group you know some of the leaks which are really very seriously because they're very bad in terms of national security - right the enemy of Obama is still out there he he yesterday he blamed Hollywood leftism for their flubs at the Oscars he said you know you were wasting so much time bashing me you forgot to actually hand out the right under looks at the Oscars bashing Hollywood will actually there they're a good enemy they're an enemy that most Americans don't like he doesn't like China right it is like Mexico right these are these are enemies that most Americans are pretty much okay with Americans are okay with Mexico actually Americans I think we have a 62% approval rating of Mexico but on China Americans aren't real fond of China in other words Trump has his own enemies and by attacking those enemies he makes himself more popular if Democrats keep attacking Trump there's no guarantee that makes them more popular or that it makes Trump any less popular because Trump is a known quantity the electorate is already so polarized in an area where the electorate is not polarized attacking Bush works when Bush had a 40% approval rating from Democrats going in and that goes down to zero but what happens when Trump's at 45% and his approval rating among Democrats is three there's no room to move there's no way to actually move that crowd so I'm not sure that the actual best strategy for Democrats is attacking Trump as easy a target as he seems to be and that's one of the secret strengths of Donald Trump meanwhile the paranoid style of politics that Trump engages in the sort of everybody is my enemy routine there's something to that in that if everybody is your enemy there's very likely to be crossover with the American public on their enemies if you have lots of enemies good shot that you and Donald Trump have some enemies in common whether you're on the right or the left if you're on the left then you also believe that the globalists right the globalists are in charge of the world economy some of your enemies are Donald Trump's enemies if you're on the right Donald Trump attacking the bureaucracy the bureaucracy is your enemy so Donald Trump by having tons of enemies it looks like a paranoid style of politics but it's actually kind of smart so talk more about that I
