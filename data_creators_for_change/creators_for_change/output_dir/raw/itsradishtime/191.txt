3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,360
videos sitting in front of this very

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,099
book shelf but I've never really gotten

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,809

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,340

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,970
because I mostly just go to the library

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually if there's a book on my shelf</font>

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,519
that means I really liked it or i bought

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,550
it for school or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read it and I checked</font>

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">out from the library but loved it so</font>

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,630
much that I ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up buying a copy for</font>

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,200
myself to keep i also have all the

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,620
clothbound Jane Austen novels that I got

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,420
when I took a Jane Austen class we read

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,910
all of them and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it would be</font>

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,770
kind of nice to splurge and get the

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,809
fancy versions and they make<font color="#E5E5E5"> me smile</font>

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:49,860
and they look really great<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,469
bookshelf and I have reread most of

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,750
these multiple times so it was worth it

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,539
here I have got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charles Bukowski</font>

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,329
and i got these books in high school why

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,910
somebody's got it in my head that

27
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charles Bukowski was a cool guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read</font>

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,400
and I actually I'm not a huge fan of him

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,290
and I think he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of a dick Thank</font>
