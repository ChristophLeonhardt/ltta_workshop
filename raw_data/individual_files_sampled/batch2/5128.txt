right there are new indications that President Trump may be preparing to speak to special prosecutor Robert Muller plus reports in the last 24 hours revealed that Muller is strengthening his case against key figures in the Russia investigation there's a lot to talk about tonight we've got an all-star panel coming up to break it all down Jill wine bags Joyce Vance and David corn but before I get to the three of them is president Trump preparing to sit down with special prosecutor Robert Muller here's a new report tonight from CNN quote President Donald Trump has begun the initial steps of preparing for a possible interview with the special counsel a White House official and a person familiar with the situation said on Friday one source familiar with the proceedings stressed the preparation effort is in its infancy the preparations have been short and informal and included going over potential topics with the president that Muller would likely raise in an interview the people said now the president has not formally agreed to speak with Muller but this is the clearest sign yet the Trump and his legal team are open to the idea also developing tonight new evidence that calls into question whether a Trump ally may have misled Congress according to a report from ABC News Robert Muller has obtained evidence it took that calls into question congressional testimony given by Trump supporter and Blackwater founder Erik Prince last year when he described a meeting in Seychelles with a Russian financier close to Vladimir Putin as a casual chance encounter over a beer documents reportedly obtained by robert muller suggest that Erik Prince met before and after that Seychelles meeting with Jorge nadir an advisor to the United Arab Emirates who visited White House in the White House frequently in the early months of the Trump administration well Jorge nadir apparently shared information with Eric Prince about that Russian financier during several encounters and those sources are telling that to ABC News now that appears to be inconsistent with Eric Prince's sworn testimony before a House investigative panel that the seychelles meeting happened by chance and Robert Muller's office has released a trove of documents related to its case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort the documents contain seven search warrants one of the for data from 5-8 AT&T phone numbers was just obtained last month on March 9th two weeks after Muller issued his second indictment against meta for suggesting that Muller's team might still be investigating new lines of inquiry against Manta for the timing of the warrant is also significant in that it was issued a week after former Manafort partner Rick Gates accepted a plea deal with Muller's team all right joining us now are jill wine banks former assistant Watergate special prosecutor and MSNBC contributor Joyce Vance is a former federal prosecutor and professor at the University of Alabama law school she's also an MSNBC contributor and David corn is the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones and co-author of the new book Russian roulette the inside story of Putin's war on America and the election of Donald Trump he's an MSNBC political analyst welcome to all of you Jill let me start with you the idea that the president is getting ready to sit down with Donald Trump as early in the planning stages that that maybe first of all would that be Donald Trump and his team's decision and if so what does that tell you well first of all I think it's interesting that they're saying it's in its infancy in preparation and that it's short and informal which is exactly what you would expect from a president who doesn't read and it doesn't have a very big attention span so he would have to be short in order for him to pay attention and no it isn't his choice because if Muller wants to get his testimony all he has to do is issue a subpoena and then he can ask anything he wants the president would have to then invoke a Fifth Amendment privilege which he would keep with him he does not have any other privilege that he could use to avoid answering questions particularly those that involve is conducting anything that has to do with a crime there is no protection for that choice let's talk a little bit about this in January Donald Trump told reporters and he's told them since then he would be looking forward to sitting down for an interview with Robert Mother let's listen to what he said I'm looking forward to it actually you want to have a deal there's been no collusion whatsoever there's no obstruction whatsoever and I'm looking forward to it Joyce we're about a day out from Donald Trump saying something on an airplane that made stormy Daniels lawyer very happy Donald Trump if he is going to talk to Robert Muller may not want to be telling reporters what he's got in mind it seems like the worst possible strategy for someone in his position it's interesting that we learned this week that the president has been told or alleges that he's been told through sources that he is a subject of the investigation not a target one of the implications of learning that is that it makes it a little bit easier as Jill points out for Muller to subpoena President Trump DOJ has a long-standing policy of very sparingly subpoenaing targets to the grand jury but that prohibition doesn't really apply to subjects and once he's in front of the grand jury his team has no control over what he's asked he can't take a lawyer into the grand jury with him he has to answer the questions unless he asserts a Fifth Amendment privilege and says in essence I can't answer this question because if I answer it I'll be incriminating myself as a criminal so this is a real problem for him but he has foreclosed the option of not testifying saying that he's willing to go and we know that Muller can enforce that one way or the other David let's talk a little bit about Eric Prince the Blackwater founder the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos who spoke with great bluster about this meeting in the seychelles that is now being investigated reportedly in greater detail let me tell you what he told Stephanie ruhle let's listen to what he told Stephanie ruhle and me right after talking to the congressional committee so you were in the seychelles why should you meet that Russian guy what was the reason to meet him the Emirati guy said it's someone that done business with before and it would be be an interesting guy for you to know because we were both involved in the commodities and energy space so I had a beer with him I don't know if he had a beer he probably had puppy had vodka but in that meeting and after and after that I had no contact with him or any of his colleagues at all did you know that he was an associate of president Putin's that when you met he was described to me as a Russian hedge fund manager let's play this out David a Russian hedge fund manager he goes to the Seychelles and casually meets for a drink with a Russian hedge fund manager who was introduced to him by that Emirati guy who turns out to be Jorge nadir what do you make of this well you know he also gave testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that was you know the transcripts were provided to the public and if you read those he seems even more arrogant and casual about this than he did in his interview with you guys you know no big deal I was just there there was you know he doesn't mention that this guy George nadir who is an associate it seems of everybody for the Russians the the the the people running the UAE the United Arab Emirates and of course you know people related to the Trump campaign so it really you know if the stories are true that Robert Mahler has testimony from George Nader that he set up this meeting purposefully to create a back channel between the Trump transition at the time and the Russians Eric Prince is in a lot of hot water it indicates or he gives a strong indication that he lied or didn't tell the truth when he was talking to Congress and whether you do that under oath or not as you know yep that's a crime so I mean I think this is you know a very very significant issue and speaks to the idea of collusion at least collusion during the transition by choice we're starting to see a picture here right we've got as David corn says we got this Georg nadir who Eric Prince refers to as that emirati guy who seems to be like Waldo everybody he's all over the place it keeps popping up with connections to all sorts of people we've got Eric Prince who has a lot of connections to to Trump and has been trying to do business with the Trump administration he wanted to take over the war in Afghanistan and it looks like these two guys maybe didn't casually and accidentally meet a Russian and American in Seychelles put this together for me you know there have been an awful lot of forgotten meetings with Russians or meetings with Russians that weren't very important among people in the Trump camp I'm sure Muller has noticed that and now he has a very interesting hook for learning more about those meetings because we have Eric Prince who by all appearances is on the hook for perjury that's the sort of thing where Muller may be able to approach him and flip him that would mean give him sort of a plea bargain where he would get better treatment in terms of sentencing than he would get if he were simply to go to trial or be prosecuted for this crime of perjury and perhaps Muller will then be able to use prints to explain all of these unexplained and forgotten meetings held by so many people in the Trump camp with Russians throughout the campaign Jill let's talk about Oleg Deripaska one of the Russians who was sanctioned he is somebody who has ties to Paul Manafort these have been established he is the one who was paying Paul Manafort for lobbying work on behalf of the Russian government and some say perhaps getting some access to the Trump campaign as a result what do you think about this new development I I think it's very interesting but I'd also like to add to the comments about Eric Prince because anybody who ever believed that that was a casual meeting in the Seychelles I would like to offer them as a very good investment the 666th building doesn't Kushner's now pass because it was never believable that was ridiculous and Deripaska is another contact to russia it is another thing that is manna fort and gates are clearly involved with and they were very much involved in the Trump campaign so that we're looking at not just obstruction we're looking at collusion and I think that the evidence is growing on both of those cases George I want to ask you about this a randall le iceland who teaches white-collar criminal law at George Washington University writes about the Rosenstein memo this week authorizing robert muller to look into mana Ford's business dealings obviously mana Ford is the connection to Deripaska here it says the memo specifically authorizes a focus on collusion by the former campaign chairman himself the investigation of Russian ties within the campaign clearly is not limited to more fringe players such as george papadapolis or the ever surprising carter page the Rosenstein memo means the FBI had a basis to suspect russian collusion involving the very highest levels of the trump campaign the reason I ask you this choice is because this gets interesting when people look at the indictment against Paul Manafort a lot of people say hey it's a lot of money laundering not disclosing business interests maybe tax evasion but it doesn't actually look like collusion now the pieces are starting to fall into place that Paul Manta Ford Oleg Deripaska and a lot of money changing hands it looks like Muller has been circling the whole time bringing in various players and pieces of this investigation but never losing sight of the fact that what he's really investigating is whether or not there was Russian interference in the u.s. election and if so whether there were people in the Trump campaign who were involved it begins to look increasingly like their players who are very close to the president himself who had relationships with people in Russia who were in meshed with them for business or other purposes there are all sorts of allegations from the NRA receiving Russian money to Russian oligarchs who were funneling money into campaigns using straw contributors people in a mayor who are American citizens to whom they funneled money so it's very interesting to watch this all come to the middle with Manafort who increasingly now there is evidence that he was directly involved with oligarchs that he was involved in the creation of back channels that he was present when meetings were held with Russians and at the end of the day these complaints that we've heard so far about from many people that Muller is well beyond his jurisdiction are going to be put to rest right we look at that memo that rod Rosen Stein wrote and Anna's Paul Fishman the former US Attorney in New Jersey pointed out yesterday - two little sentences that follow the grant of jurisdiction from Rosenstein to muller as regards manna fort and the second one ends with a semicolon and then the rest of that memo is blacked out so there's more about manna for it than what we actually know at this moment that Miller has been given authority to investigate choice fans thank you for your analysis tonight as always hey there I'm Chris
