00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,070
our Brazil played better today than I've

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole tournament and</font>

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,940
ironically they go out on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">performance I thought defensively</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,400
know they're very unlucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the first</font>

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,259
goal it's just got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little flick of</font>

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,109
company which<font color="#CCCCCC"> then hit see I'm a fan and</font>

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Daniel goes in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's what happens in</font>

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,250
football<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really recover</font>

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,720
from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they find themselves</font>

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,640
to nail down at<font color="#CCCCCC"> halftime um but I have</font>

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,710
to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we're saying</font>

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,929
goodbye to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of the better teams</font>

14
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">now where you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think some of the</font>

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,700
other teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were still in the</font>

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,500
tournament<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe you know when you'd</font>

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,910
swap them all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the nature of</font>

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,040
the World Cup<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font>

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,850
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted them to in</font>

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,530
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to push it a little</font>

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more and they did with the goal the</font>

22
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">goal was fantastic they went you know it</font>

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,629
was a ball into the box from from

24
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">Coutinho and out to Agosto who would</font>

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,989
just come on it's been on the pitch for

26
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,660
three minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> scored</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then again two</font>

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,250
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> later he had another chance that</font>

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,438
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that that ball was in</font>

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it just sneaked outside the post and</font>

30
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,350
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> TD changed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a little bit he took a</font>

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,990
couple heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> ooh his loose off put</font>

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Douglas Custer on he took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Paolini</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,330
and put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Agosto on and Willian came</font>

34
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,000
on and it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> off at half-time for me</font>

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">new came on and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gusteau's because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,220
had a real impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> causing all</font>

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,320
sorts of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> all three</font>

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,460
substitutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked so so most of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,900
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that happened in the</font>

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,500
second half was they were involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,840
look to Nima to say you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">your opportunity to show how good you</font>

43
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:41,700
are

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,009
he had little sniffs he had there

45
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,930
there's a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where he gets a ball</font>

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,360
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side he passes it</font>

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,460
inside the box<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Femina Femina</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,670
shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes just just over and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> named</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

49
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,130
also had a shot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 90 minutes</font>

50
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,430
plus 3 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thibaut Courtois</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

51
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,140
fantastically

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,780
and but other than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was not he</font>

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,280
was not be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're dominating</font>

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,530
figuring this you know do you think

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're seeing how good Belgium really are</font>

56
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,830
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it was difficult sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of to</font>

57
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,180
gauge<font color="#CCCCCC"> before given who they played</font>

58
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,500
against I mean that paid England<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,550
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like a friendly</font>

60
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,320
inverted commas<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then they played</font>

61
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,180
Japan and people may thought they made

62
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,470
heavy weather<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that and it was quite</font>

63
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to work out actually how good they</font>

64
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,920
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah but I think what Belgium is</font>

65
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,780
it's a team<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a proper football team</font>

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-constructed it's well setup</font>

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Roberto Martinez he's got options</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he can</font>

68
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,610
change it tactically he can change

69
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,310
personnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what they also have is</font>

70
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,770
individual players who can change game

71
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,950
even has<font color="#E5E5E5"> I in the last 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes what</font>

72
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bertram did obviously they defended him</font>

73
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,310
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had the ball were</font>

74
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,320
looking for him<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he can keep the ball</font>

75
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,770
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 10 15 seconds which is so helpful</font>

76
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're under the pressure from from a</font>

77
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,780
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Brazil we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Haase Fellaini</font>

78
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,930
for me was today incredible<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

79
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's his big strong awkward he can run</font>

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,900
he a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people they look at Fellini</font>

81
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,989
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they see something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

82
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,940
someone they can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's</font>

83
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,830
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but technically he's very good</font>

84
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">unless you know he came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other day</font>

85
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">change the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chappy today was what</font>

86
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,920
was fantastic

87
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,660
Kevin de Bruyne<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I mean the last</font>

88
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">five minutes he could hardly walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

89
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,920
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> he did he'd work so they've got</font>

90
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,540
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these incredible individuals</font>

91
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,880
individually skilled players who every

92
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">single one of them can change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the game</font>

93
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lukaku</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again today worked really hard it</font>

94
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,280
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it didn't come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for him</font>

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,290
he didn't score<font color="#CCCCCC"> but work so hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

96
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,700
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was all over the place at times</font>

97
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,049
he was running down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wing I mean most</font>

98
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,640
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember hearing more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seam as a</font>

99
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">centre forward but it's like a winger</font>

100
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,640
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so this is what I mean it's a</font>

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,160
team and and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes a very</font>

102
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,860
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to having you know 11</font>

103
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,750
individual players who all wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

104
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,760
out there and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there and you know</font>

105
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,340
get get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> limelight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have match</font>

106
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,390
winners in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this team's</font>

107
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,910
so I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> Courtois that's saving</font>

108
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last minute all</font>

109
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,340
not even in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last minute it was in</font>

110
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,640
the 93rd<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so 90</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,710
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes added on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say it</font>

112
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,510
was fantastic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what they have</font>

113
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have guys who can change the</font>
