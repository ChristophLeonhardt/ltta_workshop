1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ANNOUNCED
THAT THEY ARE PARTING WAYS WITH

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,689
STEVE BANNON, THE CHIEF
STRATEGIST OF THE TRUMP

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:08,929
ADMINISTRATION.

4
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:16,980
[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM] DOWN GOES BANNON!

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,010
WHAT NOW?

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,029
WHAT NOW?

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,099
OKAY, OF COURSE WE ARE
NOT REALLY SURE THAT WE GOT HIM.

8
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,851
THERE'S AN EXCELLENT CHANCE HE
GOT HIMSELF, ALONG WITH THE

9
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:30,980
ENTIRE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,390
I
THINK TRUMP STILL THINKS HE'S ON

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,700
THE APPRENTICE, HE HAS TO FIRE
SOMEONE EVERY WEEK.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,160
AT ALMOST EVERY FRIDAY.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,910
SCARAMUCCI WAS OUT ON A MONDAY,
EVERYONE ELSE IS OUT ON A

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,540
FRIDAY.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,160
USUALLY IN A NORMAL
ADMINISTRATION THE NEWS CYCLE

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,510
STARTS TO DIE DOWN, AND BY
FRIDAY THERE IS VERY LITTLE NEWS

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,930
TO COVER, BUT NO, WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION FRIDAY TENDS TO

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,890
BE AN EXPLOSIVE NEWSDAY, AND THE
WEEKEND GETS MORE EXPLOSIVE.

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,890
LET

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,470
ME GIVE YOU BACKGROUND AND
CONTEXT OF WHAT IS GOING ON

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,550
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DRAMA
AND IT'S VERY GOOD.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,550
LET'S START

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,010
FROM THE BEGINNING, THE WHITE
HOUSE RELEASED A STATEMENT TODAY

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,120
INDICATING THEY WERE PART WAYS
WITH STEVE BANNON, SARAH

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:22,130
HUCKABEE SANDERS RELEASED THAT
STATEMENT AND 

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,690
SAID --

27
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,150
OF COURSE EVEN THOUGH
BANNON'S GONE THERE ARE SOME

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,000
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS
STILL LEAKING TO THE MEDIA, AND

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,350
THEY SAY IT WASN'T A MUTUAL
DECISION, I'LL GET TO THAT IN A

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,940
SECOND, BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME
FORESHADOWING OF THIS.

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,940
EARLIER

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,170
IN THE WEEK WHEN DONALD TRUMP
GAVE HIS SUPER QUESTIONABLE

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,130
PRESS CONFERENCE ON
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH QUICKLY

34
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,030
DEVOLVED INTO COMMENTS ABOUT HOW
WHITE SUPREMACISTS ARE BAD JUST

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,840
LIKE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT ARE BAD,
HE ALSO TOUCHED ON STEVE BANNON

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
--

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,350
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR CHIEF
STRATEGIST, MR.

38
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,350
BANNON?

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,350
I NEVER SPOKE TO MR.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,350
BANNON
ABOUT IT.

41
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,990
DO YOU STILL HAVE CONFIDENCE
IN HIM?

42
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,639
LOOK, I LIKE MR.

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,420
BANNON, HE'S
A FRIEND OF MINE.

44
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
BUT MR.

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,420
BANNON

46
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,690
CAME ON VERY LATE, YOU KNOW THAT
TIME I WENT THROUGH 17 SENATORS,

47
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,120
GOVERNORS, AND WON ALL THE
PRIMARIES, MR.

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
BANNON CAME ON

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,840
LATER THAN THAT, AND I LIKE HIM,
HE'S A GOOD MAN, HE'S NOT A

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,590
RACIST, I CAN TELL YOU THAT,
HE'S A GOOD PERSON, HE GETS

51
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,340
UNFAIR PRESS IN THAT REGARD, WE
WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH

52
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,340
MR.

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,170
BANNON BUT HE'S A GOOD
PERSON AND I THINK THE

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,090
PRESS TREATS HIM FRANKLY VERY
UNFAIRLY.

55
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,810
AT THAT POINT HE WAS GONE.

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,290
TRUMP IS SUCH A MADMAN THAT

57
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,530
THERE'S SOME CHANCE HE WOULD
HAVE RETAINED HIM, BUT ANY OTHER

58
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,660
PRESIDENT WHO SAYS WE'LL SEE
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT GUY,

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,490
THAT DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN
MADE.

60
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,120
ALSO IT IS RUMORED THAT IT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED EARLIER

61
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
ANYWAY.

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
AND ALSO, MR.

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
BANNON?

64
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,460
BANNON BANNON FO-FANNON --
THERE'S SUCH A DISTANCE.

65
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,730
I ALSO THINK HE'S A LITTLE
SCARED OF HIM, BECAUSE HE HAS

66
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,740
THAT BREITBART, ALT-RIGHT
CONTINGENT.

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,069
HE ALMOST NEVER CALLS ANYONE MR.

68
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,069
ANYTHING.

69
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,130
IF HE WAS SCARED THEN --

70
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,920
THAT CONTINGENT IS GOING TO
WAR, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
A SECOND.

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,940
SO THAT'S WHY THE
CONTEXT OF STEVE BANNON'S

73
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,640
CALLING ROBERT KUTTNER AT THE
AMERICAN PROSPECT AND SAYING THE

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,290
THINGS HE DID IS FASCINATING,
I'M NOT SURE IT'S THAT RELEVANT

75
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,600
ANYMORE, BUT IT'S FASCINATING AS
TO -- BECAUSE HE SAID THAT AFTER

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,470
TRUMP SAID WE'LL SEE ABOUT MR.

77
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,480
BANNON.

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,260
THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS
THAT PLAYED INTO THIS EVENTUAL

79
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,240
OUTCOME, AND I WANT TO TOUCH ON
ALL OF THOSE FACTORS NOW.

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
FIRST

81
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,430
OF ALL, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
BANNON HAD A VERY TENSE

82
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,970
RELATIONSHIP WITH SEVERAL
MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S

83
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,770
ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING JARED
KUSHNER, SOMEONE WHO HE BELIEVES

84
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,120
IS THIS GLOBALIST, AND BY THE
WAY, PEOPLE WHO WRITE FOR

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,010
BREITBART HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING
KUSHNER PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY.

86
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,010
AND

87
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,200
THERE'S ALSO GARY COHN, THE
NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL

88
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,209
DIRECTOR, AND H.R. MCMASTER.

89
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,100
BANNON USED TO BE PART OF THE

90
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,170
SECURITY COUNCIL BUT WAS
ESSENTIALLY KICKED OUT, AND H.R.

91
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,780
MCMASTER HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THAT, SO BANNON HAS BEEN

92
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:42,720
PRETTY SALTY ABOUT 
THAT SINCE IT

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,930
OCCURRED.

94
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,770
ALSO --

95
00:04:48,770 --> 00:05:07,080
ALSO IN REGARD TO 
TRUMP --

96
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,260
ONLY THE PRESIDENT GETS TO
MAKE PERSONNEL CHANGES, SO WHEN

97
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,370
BANNON SAID I'M GOING TO FIRE
THIS GUY OR PUT THAT PERSON IN

98
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,010
PLACE, THAT DEFINITELY GOT UNDER
TRUMP'S SKIN, THAT TOUCHES HIS

99
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,960
EGO, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN
THE WORLD.

100
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
IT'S NOT OVERLY

101
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,950
IMPORTANT NOW THAT BANNON IS OUT
AS TO THE CHRONOLOGY, THIS WHOLE

102
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,520
IDEA THAT BANNON WANTED TO
RESIGN ANYWAY ON AUGUST 2,

103
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,449
THAT'S TOTAL B.S., IGNORE THAT
COMPLETELY, HE FOUGHT IT ALL THE

104
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,960
WAY TO THE END, AND IT APPEARS
BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE

105
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,210
REPORTING THAT HE WAS FIRED
TODAY AND IS A FACE-SAVING

106
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,380
GESTURE THEY SAID WE WILL LET
YOU CALL IT A RESIGNATION.

107
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,380
BUT

108
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,490
NOW, IRONICALLY BECAUSE HE WAS A
HUGE LEAKER, THEY ARE LEAKING

109
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,590
ALL OVER THE PLACE GOING, IT
WASN'T A RESIGNATION, HE WAS

110
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,590
FIRED.

111
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,350
MY SENSE OF IT, MICHAEL,
IS THAT IF TRUMP HADN'T MADE UP

112
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,210
HIS MIND HE WAS CLOSE TO IT
BEFORE BANNON GAVE THAT

113
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,640
DISASTROUS INTERVIEW TO THE
AMERICAN PROSPECT --

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,680
THAT THE IRONY, IT CAME FROM
GIVING AN INTERVIEW TO A FAIRLY

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,389
LIBERAL PUBLICATION.

116
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,080
SO IN A SENSE, WE GOT HIM.

117
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,600
THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING.

118
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,710
AND
IF THAT WASN'T IT IT WAS JOHN

119
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,140
KELLY COMING IN AS OTHERS HAVE
DONE AND WHAT THEY CALL TRUMP

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,070
WORLD, DOING THE SAME THING.

121
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,889
TRUMP, IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE

122
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,700
YOU JUST PLAYED, ANA, HE SAID WE
WON A LOT OF PRIMARIES, WE GOT A

123
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,530
LOT OF GOVERNORS, BEFORE BANNON
GOT HERE.

124
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,260
BUT TO BANNON'S CREDIT

125
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,630
HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB IN THE
GENERAL ELECTION OF FINDING OUT

126
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,650
WHERE TO GO IN FINDING OUT WHAT
THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T VOTE IN

127
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,940
THE PRIMARIES OR IN PAST
ELECTIONS, OR REALLY JUST WANTED

128
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,400
DONALD TRUMP TO BE THERE, WHERE
THEY WERE, AND HELPED TARGET

129
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,330
THAT ELECTION.

130
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,479
HE WAS AN
EFFICIENT LEADER AT THAT TIME,

131
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,580
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH TRUMP HE
COULD DISPOSE OF PAUL MANAFORT

132
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,169
WHO WAS COMING IN TO CLEAN HOUSE
AND MAKE EVERYTHING WORK -- IF

133
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,270
JOHN KELLY THINKS HE'S GOT A JOB
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, HE

134
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,470
COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG.

135
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,500
TRUMP,
IT'S SEE YOU LATER AND THAT'S

136
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,840
THE END OF IT WITH THESE PEOPLE.

137
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,449
LEWANDOWSKI COMES IN ONCE IN A
WHILE.

138
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,190
ULTIMATELY I THINK HE WILL DO
IT TO HIMSELF AT THE END.

139
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,190
OKAY

140
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,980
DONNIE, YOU'RE FIRED.

141
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,940
BUT THAT'S
FOR ANOTHER DAY.

142
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
BUT TO YOUR

143
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,919
POINT, MICHAEL, WHEN HE TALKS
ABOUT THOSE STATES HE WON

144
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,320
WITHOUT BANNON, THAT'S HIM
SAYING REMEMBER, IT WAS ME, NOT

145
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,650
MR.

146
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,979
BANNON.

147
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,259
THE NUMBER ONE OFFENSE IN
TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL

148
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:47,580
GET YOU FIRED IS HURTING HIS EGO
IN ANY WAY. AND IF YOU TAKE

149
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,860
CREDIT FOR ANYTHING IN TRUMP'S
ADMINISTRATION HE WILL FIND A

150
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,290
WAY TO FIRE YOU, AND I THINK
THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN HIS

151
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,030
EVENTUAL FIRING.

152
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,900
I ALSO THINK,
THOUGH, THAT THERE WAS A FEAR --

153
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,460
OR NOT JUST A FEAR, I THINK
THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE, THAT

154
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,220
BANNON WAS ONE OF THE LEAKERS,
AND I DON'T THINK THAT AMERICAN

155
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,960
PROSPECT INTERVIEW -- LOOK, SOME
OUTLETS REPORTED ON THAT

156
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,971
INTERVIEW AS IF BANNON PULLED A
SCARAMUCCI AND DIDN'T KNOW THAT

157
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:16,840
IT WAS NOT OFF THE RECORD.

158
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,870
BANNON ISN'T AN IDIOT, HE WORKS

159
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,870
IN THE MEDIA.

160
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,620
HE KNEW IT WAS ON
THE RECORD, HE KNEW IT WOULD GET

161
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,840
REPORTED, I THINK THAT WAS HIM
FLEXING HIS MUSCLES TO SHOW

162
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,100
TRUMP, I HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE
IN MEDIA.

163
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,759
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
QUESTION.

164
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,759
THAT'S A PERFECTLY

165
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,820
GOOD HYPOTHESIS.

166
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,029
I HAVE TWO
OTHERS, WHICH I HAVEN'T MADE UP

167
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,029
MY MIND BETWEEN.

168
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,759
ONE IS THAT
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU KNOW

169
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,089
SOMETHING IS GOING IN A CERTAIN
DIRECTION, AND I'VE SEEN

170
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,720
ATHLETES DO THIS A MILLION
TIMES, YOU WILL SUBCONSCIOUSLY

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,259
THROW IT.

172
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,639
HIM GOING ON THERE,
NOT CLARIFYING THAT IT'S OFF THE

173
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,999
RECORD, AND SAYING ALL THIS
STUFF, IS A WAY OF THROWING IN

174
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,259
THE TOWEL, I'M DONE WITH THIS.

175
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,350
POSSIBLE, I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S

176
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,350
DEFINITE.

177
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,060
AND I KNOW THAT'S POP
PSYCHOLOGY, I GET THAT.

178
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,399
AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE
WOULD'VE PICKED THE AMERICAN

179
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,300
PROSPECT TO THROW THE FLAG IN.

180
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:10,959
THE OTHER THING HE MIGHT HAVE
DONE, BECAUSE HE'S NOT AS DUMB

181
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,220
AS TRUMP -- TRUMP WOULDN'T HAVE
THOUGHT ANY OF THIS THROUGH, IF

182
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,399
TRUMP DID IT I WOULD SAY HE'S AN
IDIOT, HE CALLED THE GUY AND

183
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,519
THAT'S IT -- IS HE KNEW HE WAS
GETTING FIRED, HE SAW THAT PRESS

184
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,470
CONFERENCE, HE KNEW THAT WE'LL
SEE MEANS YOU ARE DONE, SO HE

185
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,399
DOES THIS SO HE IS A FIG LEAF
FOR WHY HE GOT FIRED LIKE

186
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,249
SCARAMUCCI AS OPPOSED TO, YOU
ARE TOO RACIST, YOU ARE TOO THIS

187
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,459
OR THAT, AND YOU WERE SHOWN THE
DOOR.

188
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,889
THIS SEEMS LIKE I SCREWED

189
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,070
UP THAT ONE LITTLE THING AND
THAT'S WHY I GOT FIRED,

190
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,730
OTHERWISE I HAD IT.

191
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,980
THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.

192
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,930
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS,
THAT STUFF DOESN'T MATTER

193
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,100
NOW THAT HE'S GONE, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT

194
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
HE'S GONE.

195
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,540
HE'S GONE, AND WHAT I
SPECULATE HE WILL DO NOW THAT

196
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,800
HE'S GONE I THINK IS WAY MORE
RELEVANT.

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I KNOW IT'S ONLY

198
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,309
SPECULATION, BUT PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT BANNON WILL GO RIGHT BACK

199
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,209
TO BREITBART, WHY WOULDN'T HE?

200
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,689
HE STILL HAS INFLUENCE OVER THE

201
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:13,990
REPORTING THAT TAKES PLACE
THERE, WHICH IS WHY THEY BEEN SO

202
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,160
CRITICAL OF EVERYONE IN THE
ADMINISTRATION THAT BANNON

203
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,749
DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH.

204
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:27,119
I THINK THE FACT HE'S GONE IS
GREAT NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY FOR

205
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,100
SEVERAL REASONS.

206
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,759
NUMBER ONE IS,
HE'S THE FATHER OF THE ALT-RIGHT

207
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,329
MOVEMENT, A WHITE NATIONALIST
MOVEMENT, HAVING THAT GUY IN THE

208
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:42,310
WHITE HOUSE WAS TOXIC, AND IT'S
A GREAT RELIEF THAT HE'S GONE.

209
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,740
THE SECOND IS THAT HE'S WAY
BRIGHTER THAN TRUMP, AND IF HE

210
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,300
HAD DONE HIS EXACT POPULIST
STRATEGY -- NOT POLICY WISE,

211
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,230
POLICY WISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
DISASTER -- BUT POLITICALLY IT

212
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,339
HAD SOME CHANCE OF WORKING.

213
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,769
IF
YOU WENT WITH AN ECONOMIC

214
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,439
NATIONALISM LIKE HE TOLD KUTTNER
AT THE AMERICAN PROSPECT, IT'S

215
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:06,760
AN UGLY FORM OF POLITICS BUT ONE
THAT HAS POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY AT

216
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,610
A TIME OF POPULIST RAGE.

217
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,399
NOW
WITHOUT HIM TRUMP HAS NO CHANCE

218
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,489
OF PULLING THAT OFF, AND NOW
HE'S SURROUNDED BY GOLDMAN SACHS

219
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:18,489
GUYS WHO THE COUNTRY BASICALLY
HATES.

220
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:20,379
AND NOW HE'S BASICALLY

221
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,699
TAKING SOME OF HIS ALT-RIGTH
BASE WITH HIM.

222
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:24,699
EVEN IF THEY

223
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:28,829
AREN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR A
DEMOCRAT, A LOT OF THEM SAID

224
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:29,829
THEY WILL STAY HOME.

225
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:30,879
AND THAT
WAS THE PROBLEM THE DEMOCRATS

226
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,879
HAD.

227
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,769
SO IT'S JUST A GIANT
WIN/WIN FOR US IN THE COUNTRY

228
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:38,249
THAT BANNON IS OUT BECAUSE
POLICY WISE THEY WON'T GO

229
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:41,649
IN AS BAD A DIRECTION
WITHOUT HIS GUIDANCE, AND

230
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,939
POLITICALLY I THINK IT DOES
SERIOUS DAMAGE TO TRUMP.

231
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,410
THAT IS TRUE.

232
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,980
AFTER REINCE
PRIEBUS LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE I

233
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,329
SPOKE TO SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO SAID THERE'S

234
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:54,351
ALWAYS A CALCULATION THEY MAKE,
THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY SAY HOW

235
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:59,249
MUCH IS THIS GUY OR THIS WOMAN
THAT HURT US FROM OUTSIDE?

236
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,249
THERE

237
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,930
WAS ALWAYS THE FEAR THAT STEVE
BANNON LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE

238
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,689
UNDER BAD CIRCUMSTANCES, AND
IT'S BAD FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

239
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,649
BECAUSE HE WILL GO OUT AND JUST
WAGE WAR AGAINST THEM AND SAY

240
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:15,709
WHAT THE SECRETS ARE, ETC., AND
AFTERWARDS TODAY BANNON GAVE AN

241
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,189
INTERVIEW AND HE SAID HE IS
GOING TO WAR, BUT HE'S GOING TO

242
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,490
WAR WITH THE OPPONENTS OF THE
WHITE HOUSE.

243
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,490
HE'S GOING TO SPEND

244
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,040
HIS TIME GOING AFTER THE
OPPONENTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

245
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,660
WHICH YOU CAN BELIEVE HE WOULD
SAY TODAY, BUT WATCH HIM IN A

246
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,730
WEEK OR A MONTH OR THREE MONTHS,
BECAUSE MOST LIKELY HE HAS A

247
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,480
CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED AND HOW IT HAPPENED.

248
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
BUT MAYBE NOT.

249
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,699
HE HAS LIVED IN
THE SHADOWS IN SOME RESPECTS,

250
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,649
NOW HE'S GOING TO COME OUT.

251
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,779
YOU
CALLED HIM THE FATHER OF THE

252
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,350
ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT, I WOULD SAY
HE'S MORE OF THE GODFATHER.

253
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,350
HE

254
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,429
CULTIVATED IT, AND HE MAY BE
MORE DANGEROUS NOW.

255
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:01,620
OF COURSE HE WILL ATTACK THE
LEFT.

256
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
HE AND I NEVER HAD

257
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,279
INTERACTIONS, WE MET ONCE AT THE
RNC -- OF COURSE HE DOESN'T LIKE

258
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,370
THE LEFT, BUT HE HAS HAD EIGHT
MONTHS OF WARFARE AGAINST GARY

259
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,989
COHN AND JARED KUSHNER AND ALL
THE GUYS HE CALLS GLOBALISTS,

260
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:20,630
ESPECIALLY H.R. MCMASTER, HE
WILL GO TO WAR AGAINST THEM.

261
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,670
IT'S LIKE CIRSEI -- I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THE WHITE WALKERS, I

262
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,429
WILL GO AFTER MY OPPONENTS IN
WESTEROS FIRST.

263
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:30,689
SPEAKING OF

264
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,879
WHITE WALKERS, AND STEVE BANNON
YOU HAVE A HELLUVA WHITE

265
00:13:34,879 --> 00:00:00,000
WALKER AND HE JUST WALKED OUT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE.
