breaking news here stormy Daniels is suing Donald Trump for defamation this is the second lawsuit that Daniels has filed against the president the latest suit claims that he defamed her when he questioned her story that a man threatened her to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump joining me from Washington NBC's Julia Ainsley so Julia just filed fill-in-the-blanks what do we know here okay so this of course the second lawsuit that stormy Daniels her real name being Stephanie Clifford has filed against the president this is coming of her defamation over a tweet that he issued earlier where he said she was a total con job that was after she had issued a picture of a man who she said approached her and told her to drop the story that she had about their alleged affair now she's suing him for defamation saying that she's been exposed to threats because of his tweeting that would also be the third major case that has come out of this we know there's a two lawsuit she laid out but then as a result of trumps lawyer Michael Cohen paying store McDaniels a hundred and thirty thousand dollars he is now under federal investigation for that payment which has put the original lawsuit on hold so it's unclear right now how far this defamation claim can go because there's already this broader federal criminal probe into Cohen's role in all of this yeah oh do we know any details here where this is where this is being filed for instance yes this would also be in Manhattan this is the same jurisdiction that's overseeing the other probe and it's also the same jurisdiction where Michael Cohen is pushing back saying that a lot of the materials that have been seized and the raids on his apartment really were protected under attorney-client privilege what all of this gets back to is whether or not the president for stormy Daniels terming quiet about their affair she says she was approached just before the election by a man in a parking lot and she felt threatened she was there with her child and she came up with the picture of this man who she says she's never seen again the president reacted said he had never seen this person there's that picture right there she's making all of this up but of course there was also that other turn last week where the president did say that he had worked with Michael Cohen when he represented him in this whole stormy Daniels thing was a little bit more of an admonition than he had given earlier where he said he knew nothing about this payment so we're getting more details about the way this interaction went down both and Donald Trump's interaction with Michael Cohen and then the way Michael Cohen may have arbitrated a way to keep stormy Daniels quiet of course all of this came to the public's attention when Stromer McDaniels wanted to dissolve their non-disclosure agreement and no longer stay quiet about this so she really started casting stones at the president he is of course throwing back saying she's a total con job that none of this is true and that is what has landed us in this defamation suit at this time yeah in that accusation you have there that allegation that seems to be at the heart of this particular new development this this claim from stormy Daniels that she was approached by somebody in Las Vegas making some kind of threat the president saying apparently that that's kind of a con job do we know has any more information materialized about that we put that sketch up there that she that she helped put together with her description if we learn anything else about that no I mean as far as we know we don't know who this person is of course that the sketch sort of gets someone closer to it we sure that Michael avenatti her lawyer will be pushing to try to figure out who this might be and pushing within the Trump circles to figure out who they may have hired to do this but I think what's really key at the heart of all of this is is who paid this person and where is that a hundred and thirty thousand dollars that went to stormy Daniels originated as is Trump laid out last week he said it didn't come from campaign funds but then does that show that maybe he does know where it came from that's that's more knowledge of this payment than he's ever admitted in the past and so that's what the federal probe will get into and we'll be looking into Michael Cohen's role how far this defamation case can really go at this point seems a little unclear because when you have a civil case that is happening under the umbrella of a federal probe the federal probe will take president any any resources anything that then maybe can't be shared because it could somehow interfere with the federal probe can be put on hold in a civil case to allow the federal probe to continue hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over
