you know going back to Barry Neufeld in Chilliwack he is not going to be bullied he's sort of had this firestorm swarming around him since he made that Facebook post I think was back in October or November he is undeterred he's doubling down he's tripling down and he apparently cares little for the people who are trying to bully him I mean just a couple of it was probably just a week ago he said in a local town hall organized by a local free speech group that and I quote instead of coddling and encouraging what I regard as the sexual addiction of gender confusion I believe children should be gently encouraged to be comfortable with their own bodies and people applauded and cheered of course that is you know isn't that what we've just spent the last generation telling people to do be comfortable in your own bodies be comfortable in your own skin you're fine just the way you are and now our education system says maybe you're not fine the way you are get in the car we'll take you to the doctor and we won't tell your parents and for those kids who are quote unquote fine the way they are if you if you can use that expression or who just identify with their biological sex I can't believe I have to use this language but anyhow there being over sexualized again taught masturbation in the classroom really which teachers thinks that's a good idea why Minister of Education think that's a good topic to be done in a co-ed classroom oral sex taught in grade 8 in Ontario to carry a condom with you make a sexual plan where if you look at the people that children should consult when they're making a sexual plan parents are all the way at the bottom past like teachers nurses doctors parents are like one of the last resources that children should go to if they want to make a sexual plan which in and of itself is absurd for a child in elementary school but but getting back to Barry Neufeld yeah I mean he's being he's being tormented for for speaking out in fact he's being sued he's sorted rather he's been taken to the Human Rights Tribunal in DC for for what he's done and that's gonna be a huge fight and I'm glad that he's taken that upon himself because somebody needs to speak out that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
