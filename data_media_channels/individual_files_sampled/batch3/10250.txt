and our knowledge of the universe speak for themselves as his children have said his courage and persistence with his brilliance and humor inspired people across the world mr. speaker members will also have seen reports of a number of suspicious packages targeting Muslim members I'm sure the whole house will join me in condemning this unacceptable which has no place in our society I can tell the house that an investigation is underway and steps are being taken to bring the perpetrators to justice Mr Speaker I been making a statement following p.m. cues updating the house on the Salisbury incident this morning I have meetings with ministerial colleagues and others in additions to my duties in addition to my duties in this house I shall have further such meetings later today they key Foxcroft thanked the Prime Minister for agreeing to meet with me to discuss the work of the cross-party youth violence Commission youth violence is complex and needs long-term solutions but some things can be done right now such as legislating to ensure that all knives and sharp instruments in shops are locked away or stored behind counters ensuring no one can steal them and use them will she do this the Honourable lady has raised a very important issue and as she says this is a complex problem and we need to ensure we have long-term solutions for it my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will shortly be publishing a new serious violence strategy which will put an emphasis on n interventions early with young with young people but it's important we have tough legislation on knives but we also do need to restrict work in partnership with retailers we have recently consulted on new measures including restrictions on live sold online and in March 2016 we reached yrm secretary reached a voluntary agreement with major retailers about how knives were displayed and the training training given to sales staff to support action to tackle knife crime but the Honourable lady is right to raise this as a an area of concern Alex perhaps thanks mr. CEO on the subject of northern ireland does the Prime Minister stand by the commitments made in the joint report of December and will she confirm that we will accept nothing that will undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom can I confirm to my own boyfriend that we stand by all the commitments we made in December we've been clear that our preferred option is to deliver these through our new partnership with the EU with specific solutions to address the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland if needed and the work were undertaking with the Commission will include that on the final so-called blacks back strop which will form part of the withdrawal agreement that cannot be the text that the Commission has proposed as I have said that is unacceptable but we stand ready to work with the Commission and Irish governments to ensure that all of the commitments on Northern Ireland made in the joint report are included in the withdrawal agreement Jeremy Corbyn Thank You mr. speaker I along with the prime minister absolutely condemn the vile messages and threatening packages that have been sent to Muslim members of this house and also the rise in Islamophobia and the abusive messages that are being sent to Muslim families all over this country it has to be utterly condemned by all of us as we condemn anybody that attempts to divide our country by racism or by extremism in any form I think we just have to stand united with any community that's under threat at any time mr. speaker I'm sure the whole house would join me in supporting what the Prime Minister just said about Stephen Hawking one of the most acclaimed scientists of his generation helped us to understand about the world and the universe was also concerned about peace and the survival of the world but is also a passionate campaigner for the National Health Service and he said I have received excellent medical attention in Britain I believe in universal health care and I'm not afraid to say so mr. speaker if we believe in universal health care how can it be possible that someone lives and works in this country pays their taxes but is then denied access the NHS for life-saving cancer treatment can the Prime Minister explain minister first of all join with the right honourable gentleman in saying there is absolutely no place in our society for hate crime or racism whatever form it takes we should stand united against such behavior and such activities and can I say to the right honourable gentleman that we do ensure I'm pleased that we have a good record on the cancer provision that we're making we now see more people surviving cancer in this country as a result of changes that have been made developments that have come in the National Health Service than ever before of course we continue to work to ensure that the situation that we're putting that the treatments that we're making available are the best treatments that we can I'm not aware of the particular case that the right honourable gentleman was raised with not aware of the particular cases right honourable gentleman who's raised with me but we do want to ensure that all those who are entitled who are entitled to service with the treatment through the National Health Service are able to achieve it there are of course questions around particular drugs that are made available to individuals for treatments which of course we continue to look at Jeremy Corbyn mr. Speaker I would indeed be writing to the prime minister about the case I'm concerned about it's a man it's a man who's lived in this country for 44 years worked and paid his taxes obviously is an older gentleman and is now being denied cancer treatment and I suspect he's not alone in this and I urge her to discuss this with the Home Office and others mr. speaker I received a letter from Hilary this week a British pensioner and this goes to the point the Prime Minister just said and she says I am now having to pay for my thyroid medication because the CCG needs to save money I've worked all my life paid national insurance and this is not fair last March the health secretary said it's absolutely essential that we get back to the 95 percent target for accident emergency weights and he said it should happen like quote in the course of the next calendar year well the calendar year is now up can the Prime Minister explain why this is no longer possible well first of all on the individual case I look forward to receiving the details from the right honourable gentleman Mike may I may I just though take this opportunity of reminding him that I think he raised a case about Georgina with me last October and hasn't written to me about so so as I say I look forward to receiving the details of the case the team has just set out what we have done in relation to to cancer treatment is ensure there are more diagnostic tests taking place we see more people being seen by a specialist for suspected cancer and more people starting treatment for cancer that's why I say that we have seen an improvement in the cancer treatment that is available to people in this country and in relation to accident and emergency I'm pleased to say that we do have more doctors working in accident and emergency we have put more money in the Chancellor announced this last year both the winter pressures and to ensure that accident and emergency departments are able to provide the treatment that is right for the patient before them because for some people actually they don't need to be in an accident admitted to hospital they need to be seeing a GP we're working with the NHS to ensure that the treatment that patients receive is the treatment that is right for them mr. speaker my understanding is Georgina's case was resolved before the prime minister was Dean is either in the America following my raising it here when it proves what if nothing else mr. speaker it proves the power of Parliament mr. speaker key AME waiting target have not been met since 2015 NHS miniature NHS managers are saying they won't be met till 2019 and February was the worst ever month for accident and emergency performances NHS providers director Safran Corddry said this is the first time we've had to accept the NHS will not meet its key constitutional standards if we want to provide quality of care we need the right long-term financial settlement the NHS is clearly in crisis so why wasn't there a penny extra of the NHS in yesterday's statement by the Chancellor can I say to the right honourable gentleman we didn't wait until yesterday's spring statement to announce more money for the NHS we announced it in the budget last water as a result of that the NHS is getting two and a half billion pounds more in the forthcoming financial year 1819 and more to fund the nurses pay settlement where that is resolved mr. speaker under labor the 18-week target for non urgent operations was in place the target has also been abandoned by the Prime Minister when will that be reinstated Prime Minister the gentleman talks about under labor things that were being delivered perhaps he might look to see what what labor are doing in Wales the latest annual data the latest annual data shows we're looking at 12-hour waits in A&E that 3.4 percent of patients waited over 12 hours in Wales compared to 1.3 percent in England he wants to talk about meeting targets he should talk to the Labour government in Wales mr. speaker NHS England abandoned it say any targets until April 2019 it's a bit rich for the prime minister to be scare mongering about Wales while she's lassies abandon the targets in England mr. speaker a recent not order lots of questions to get through and they must be heard Jeremy Corbyn a recent nao report states that NHS funding will fall by nought point three percent in 2019 people's lives are at stake is the Prime Minister really saying any doctors are wrong NHS managers are wrong royal colleges are wrong health unions are wrong and actually it's only she that knows best about the NHS can I just point out to the right honourable gentleman he talks about scaremongering of Wales I was pointing out the facts about autism and that's why we do see well that's why we do see people in Wales often trying actually to get treatment in England rather than in rather than in Wales but also say to the Vice honourable gentleman we are putting more money into the National Health Service we are putting more money into the National Health Service but what you need in order to be able to do that is to ensure that you have a strong economy to provide the money for the National Health Service what do we know about the Labour's policies it would cause a run on the pound crash our economy bankrupt when people are dying because of overcrowding and long waits in our hospitals I think the Prime Minister should get a grip on it and ensure the NHS now has the money that it needs to deal with the patient demands in a recent interview the health secretary said of NHS staff when they signed up to go into medicine they knew there would be pressurised moments what they also expected was a recognition an annual pay rise without cuts in paid leave proper funding for the National Health Service and when there are 100,000 unfilled posts clearly not enough staff around them to share the burden we started with Professor Stephen Hawking and he said just a few months ago there is there is overwhelming evidence that NHS funding and the number of doctors and nurses are inadequate and it's getting worse does she agree with professor Hawking very happy to point out some facts to the right honourable gentleman we have fourteen thousand nine hundred more doctors working in the National Health Service we have we have almost thirteen thousand nine hundred more nurses working on our wards why did we put an emphasis on nurses working in our wards because of what we saw under the Labour government in Mid Staffordshire and I just say to the right honourable gentleman this but what we need to do to ensure that we can provide the funding for the NHS and we are providing record levels of funding for the NHS is to ensure that we take a balanced approach to our economy that's an approach to our economy that deals with our debts keeps taxes low on working families and puts more money into our public services like hospitals and schools Labour's approach would increase the debt nobis approach would mean less money for our schools from hospitals and it would mean higher taxes for ordinary working people because what we know about the Labour Party is it's always ordinary people who pay the price of labour yeah yeah yeah last week's launch of a consultation on all aspects of domestic violence will be widely welcomed in Gloucester and across the country so will the prime minister who has done so much on these issues confirmed today that the government intends to increase spending bed provision and where necessary women's refugees so that those who have survived yet the help and safe haven that they deserve my friend has raised a very important issue and this is an issue which I have not only obviously given considerable attention to but my right honourable friend the Home Secretary can continues to follow that it's a very important point we are entirely committed to developing a sustainable funding model for refugees I can guarantee that funding refugees will continue at the same level as today and because I know how critical this support is to the vulnerable people at a time of crisis and we will ring-fence the funding for short term supported housing overall including refugees for the long term indefinitely that means no refuge should worry about closing or have any doubts about our commitments to ensure that we provide a sustainable funding model for them Thank You mr. speaker can I associate myself with the remarks of the prime minister than the leader of the Labour Party as far as heat cream in the lamp Islamic phobia and of course thoughts are with the family and friends of the dr. Stephen Hawking's mr. speaker for months the devolved administration's have been waiting for the UK government to table amendments to Clause 11 on Monday these long-awaited amendments were published but without the agreement of the devolved governments can the Prime Minister tell the house why these amendments have been forced on the devolved administration in one sentence he says he was waiting for this amendment and the reason that we were taking time was because we were talking with the Scottish Government and the Welsh government and then we do publish he complains that we published it here in his goodies the piercer story straight the in Rockford Thank You mr. Speaker I would encourage the prime minister to listen to the question because it was about agreement and simply wasn't good enough Prime Minister famously claimed that the UK was made up of equal partners what an irony know that she's overseeing the devolution demolition of the devolution settlement in 1997 the Tories were happy to oppose the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament the laws haven't changed now in 2018 they're happy to systematically destroy the settlement that the Parliament come upon the Prime Minister once again stop this attack on devolution and redouble your efforts and working with the devolved administration's and finding agreement right honourable gentlemen this is a government that have actually given more powers to the Scottish government this is a government that will be giving more powers to the Scottish government significant extra powers will be devolved to the Scottish and Welsh Government's as a result of the decisions that we're taking around for exit but we have given more powers including of course the tax raising powers it's just a pity that the Scottish nationalists have chosen to use their tax raising powers to increase the taxes on people earning 26 thousand pounds or more Jeremy Quinn speaker washer last week held an apprenticeship fair building on the success which since 2010 has seen a 70% reduction in youth unemployment nationally we see increasing exports increasing productivity increasing real wages look my right honourable friend again remind the house that is that sustained economic performance that underpins our investment in our valued public services can I commend Horsham for holding that an apprenticeship fair I think it's very important that we give people young people the opportunity for those apprenticeships but my honourable friend is absolutely right we can only fund those public services if we have the strength in our economy providing the income for us to be able to do that and in the last few weeks we've seen manufacturing output which is now grown for nine consecutive months that's the first time since records began in 1968 we've seen the best two quarters of productivity growth since the financial crisis and the lowest year today net borrowing since 2008 and of course employment near a record high that's what conservatives are doing delivering a strong economy new jobs healthier finances an economy that really is fit for the future mr. speaker last week GKN workers came to Parliament typically 25 and 30 years service their mums and dads before them working for a British engineering icon 259 years old sat opposite were the three fabulously wealthy owners of Melrose determined to stage a hostile takeover of their company break it up and sell it off can I ask the prime minister daesh's she told Parliament she would act in the national interest the next 10 days will decide the future will she used the powers that she has to intervene to block this hostile takeover in the British national interest the Honorable gentleman as he knows the the business secretary has been speaking to both of these companies on an impartial basis we will always we will always act in the UK national interest actually it's this government but it's under this government that we've seen the change is introduced to the takeover code to provide greater transparency to give Target firms more time to respond there are a narrow range of scenarios where ministers can intervene on mergers on public interest grants but we will always ensure that we act in the national interest and roussanou three 3157 medical students are going into general practice this year which is excellent news but we are still losing too many experienced GPS in their mid-50s due to the tax penalties on their old pension scheme would the government look at a targeted time limited exemption on this dedicated group of clinicians who do so much for the health of us all my own my friend this is an important point as he will know experienced senior hospital doctors and GPS who become a member of the National Health Service Pension Scheme benefit from one of the best available defined benefit occupational pension schemes and we provide generous tax reliefs to allow everyone to build up a pension pot worth just over a million pounds tax-free but the issue that he's raising is that GPS are not penalized after if they work after age 55 but many may have exhausted the general allowed generous allowance for tax relief that is available but by that by that time but I can say to my own boyfriend that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was of course listening to the question that he raised mr. Virender Sharma the 13th of April this year represents the 99th anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar in India known as Jallianwala Bagh massacre in which more than 1,000 peaceful protesters were murdered by soldiers under the command of general Dyer will the Prime Minister join me in commemorating the massacre and meet with me and others campaigning for this shameful episode to be remembered Minister the Honorable gentleman has raised a very specific issue and a very specific point and I would be happy to look at the question that he's raised with me and respond to him in writing leo Doherty Thank You mr. speaker in my constituency farmer in the borough of Rushmore is the birthplace of British aviation and now home to a thriving range of aviation aerospace and defense businesses including the Airbus Zephyr will my rollable friend the prime minister join me in extending our best wishes to the Zephyr team as they look forward to making a world record-breaking attempt for high-altitude unmanned aviation prime minister I'm very happy to join with my honourable friend in wishing all the very best to the Zephyr team in the attempt that they are making but he's right but his constituency plays a very crucial role in the aerospace industry and I'm pleased to say that we're continuing to work with that industry through the aerospace growth partnership to ensure that we can further enhance that industry and we wish the Zephyr team well they're less discerning the UK has the lowest growth in the g7 so why is the government's answer to this to give handouts to some of the wealthiest bankers to fund an already lavish lifestyle paid for by taking the crumbs off the table of those on universal credit whose children penned on free school meals Minister first of all the oral gentlemen might not have noticed that the wealthiest 1% of people his country are now paying the biggest share of tax twenty eight percent than they did than they ever did under a Labour government but if he thought if he's referring to the bank levy can I also say to him it was the Conservative Party that introduced the bank levy that has raised 15 billion pounds and is predicted to raise a further 11 billion pounds that we can spend on public services it is the Conservative government that is changing the way we do it so we do it in a better way so in future in future we will be raising nearly 19 billion pounds from extra from the banks over the next five years that's three billion pounds more money from the banks to be spent on public services Neal Parrish great British food is produced by hard-working farming farming as we produce a new British agricultural policy does my right honourable friend agree with me that food supporting food production in this country is a public good Prime Minister very happy to to agree with my uncle friend the importance of food production in this country I'm also happy to commend the work of hard-working farmers up and down the country but also all those who work in our food production industry and we now have as my honourable friend will know historic opportunity as we leave the EU to deliver a farming policy that is going to work for the whole industry Bridget philipson just minutes ago Facebook announced that they will be taking down several pages associated with the extremist group Britain first who's the Prime Minister join me in welcoming that but does she not also accept that there needs to be a clear role provided by government to give guidance to social media companies on how they operate in our democracy welcome that announcement by Facebook and I'm pleased to say that my right on will friend the Home Secretary has been working with these companies to ensure that they do do more they do act more clearly in taking down material that is of an extremist nature but I'm very pleased to welcome the announcement that Facebook is made and I hope other companies will follow and Marie Morris may I first congratulate the Prime Minister on her pioneering work in fighting modern-day slavery however has she been advised to the central plank of her law enforcement policy isn't working with 65 prosecutions of traffickers abandoned last year because of victim fear as to their safety and no reparations orders to compensate victims for the old deals made against convicted traffickers my honourable friend for raising what is a very important issue in fact at the meeting that I chaired recently in a matter of two weeks ago I think it was of the modern slavery taskforce that I have brought together to bring people from across government but also from law enforcement from the judiciary from sorry from criminal justice more generally and from others to look at how we're working with this we were addressing exactly this issue of prosecutions and how can we we can ensure that prosecutions more prosecutions go ahead in future and perpetrators of auto justice Vernon Kay Kerr shockingly in this country in 2017 there are 2120 children who were identified as being possible potential victims of child slavery can they I know the Prime Minister's personal commitment to tackling this issue but surely we ought to have more data we have no idea how many of those children go missing we have no idea how many are deported and we have no idea how many are we trapped in this country in 2018 a modern democracy that is simply not good enough can the Prime Minister tell us what she's going to do about that very important issue and it has been a long a concern for a long time where children are identified as the victims of slavery the victims of human trafficking and when sometimes we do see them sadly in being in a position where they are then able to be taken out by traffickers and resubmitted to the horrible circumstances that that brings to them we don't return just on the point that he's making about asylum and deportation we don't return on a company children who don't qualify for asylum or humanitarian protection unless we can confirm that there is safe and adequate reception programs and arrangements in place in their home country and if we can't confirm such arrangements we grant temporary leave up until the child is seventeen and a half and last October 2017 we confirmed our commitment to roll out independent child trafficking advocates across the country this is a system that we piloted previously which will give support to those child victims to ensure that they are given the support they need and that they don't fall back into the hands of traffickers Lucy Alan many towns and cities across the country Telford has had some experiences of distressing cases of child sexual exploitation the authorities in Telford have now agreed to conduct an independent inquiry to find out what happened and to give victims officers will my right honourable friend join me in congratulating two brave women campaigner Hollie Archer and Sunday Mirror journalist Geraldine McKelvey for their work in bringing this about and will she agree to do everything possible to ensure this inquiry starts without delay and leaves no stone unturned I think we have all been shocked by the horrific case that we have seen in Telford of some of the most vulnerable in our country being preyed upon by ruthless criminals sadly of course this is not the first example that we have seen taking place across our country I'm very happy to join my honourable friend in congratulating Holly and Geraldine for the work that they have done this is not easy but it's right that they have brought this to light and that action can be taken I'm pleased that the authorities are now going to conduct an inquiry it is as my honourable friend says important that it begins its work in order to get to the truth and does that as quickly as possible and I understand that my own will friend will be meeting my own will friend the parliamentary Under Secretary for crime safeguarding and vulnerability to discuss this issue shortly after the Prime Minister took office she said that she wanted to put the government on the side of the poorest in society she even stood in front of a crumbling sign that said she wanted a country that works for everyone but with the recent IFS report stating that 37 percent of children are set to live in poverty by 2022 what went wrong Prime Minister we we have seen 200,000 fewer children living in absolute poverty in this country under this government we continue to take action to ensure that we are helping that we are helping families to get a regular income by helping people into work that we're ensuring that the lowest paid in our society get that pay increase through increasing the national living wage and ensuring that we help people with the standard of living by cutting the taxes for 31 million people so devi ramos friend aware that the inspirational music man project in Southend that works with people who had learning difficulties has now set a world record for tinkling the most number of triangles ever my right honourable friend agree with me but that is yet another reason why Southend should be made a city she please now organize a contest with our honourable friend so that southend-on-sea becomes the first post brexit City Minister I'm very happy to congratulate The Music Man project in Southend for the record that they have achieved in tinkling triangles I'm sure I'm sure that my honourable friends has heard his bid for Southend - to become a city I had to say to my honourable friend that of course there will be a number of members of this house we'll be putting forward their own sounds for that so for that accolade in due course I knew sissy had to have a Cathedral I didn't know it had to have tinkling triangles mr. speaker sir Vincent cable as the Prime Minister will be aware that the Prime Minister will be aware that this week the notorious rapist John Wall boys was released from high-security prison one of my constituents who gave evidence at his trial as a victim wants to know why he was not tested first in open prison conditions and why he that the parole board is not required to publish the reasoning behind its release decisions including evidence of countries no there is a case before the courts at the moment and I understand as part of that case the parole board will be required to explain the reasons why they took the decision but in terms of the overall issue of parole board decisions and transparency of that when this John this decision became clear my right honourable friends the then justice secretary now the Chancellor of Joshu of Lancaster called for work to be done which has been continued under the current justice secretary in law Chancellor to look at this whole question of parole board decisions in the transparency around them Heidi Allen thank you very much indeed mrs. thank you I am immensely proud to have the world leading research and teaching hospital Addenbrooke's in my constituency South Cambridgeshire the scale and excellence means they rely heavily on doctors from overseas but of late they've struggled to bring some of those doctors in because of restrictions on the tier 2 visa numbers and with applications reducing from the EU - it's becoming a real problem but he's can the Prime Minister wish to me and my hospital that she's aware of this challenge and she has a plan to address it my humble friend I am aware of that particular issue of course in the in the longer term one of the things that we are doing is to ensure that we can train more doctors here in in the United Kingdom but I'm aware of the issue that she has raised my look into it Laura Smith Thank You speaker last year the Prime Minister acknowledged that our social care system is broken and promised to fix it since then to care providers in Crewe and Nantwich have been placed into special measures and another is worried that it may have to close due to a lack of funding what does the Prime Minister say to providers you state the local government settlement doesn't go far enough and that they cannot afford to wait for the government's green paper they - the Honourable lady that she will know I have always said that there were some short-term measures that need to be taken in relation to pressure on Social Care medium-term measures and long term in the short term we have provided more funding for local authorities 2 billion extra was announced by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer we are seeing more money going into Social Care in local authorities we in the medium-term need to ensure the best practice is spread across the whole country and we also do as she's referred to the green paper need to ensure that we can develop a long-term sustainable funding model for Social Care in this country and that's what we continue to work right it is suddenly a matter of public record that RB s and H boss deliberately our assets stripped thousands of potentially viable businesses to benefit their own Bank or individual bankers and evidence before the high court indicates that Lloyds may also be guilty of the same would the Prime Minister consider that the cause of the all party group for fair business banking which has been endorsed by the chief executive of the FCA Andrew Bailey for a full public inquiry into this disgraceful scandal this is this is an issues of concern to many small businesses of the backbone of our economy and we need to ensure that we do learn the lessons that from what happens RBS and H boss and as he will know the FCA has reported areas of widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by RBS who have apologized and set up a scheme for compensation for victims there is an ongoing investigation which is continuing to be conducted by the FCA into RBS and they're also undertaking two separate investigations into H boss but we will continue to work with the independent regulator and the industry to ensure that small and medium sized businesses get the support they need because West Thank You mr. speaker it's just since Christmas there have been five high-profile gun crimes in Haringey including one last Thursday when a 19 year old young man named Kelvin attorney was shot in the head with the marksmen opinion on the back of a moped to the entrance of a cinema in Wood Green we know our streets are plagued by a knife crime now the intent to kill with a gun takes the epidemic to a whole new level this can't go on and it must stop will the Prime Minister please meet with me and community leaders to put an end to this epidemic of gun crime yes terrible lady the the I suggest that she meets with the home section who will shortly be publishing a strategy in in relation to this issue with serious violence that takes place we're all concerned about the the use of mopeds has been known for snatching for effectively mugging and that's something that my right on will friend the home so she had already been worked looking at and working on with the police but on this issue that she's raised of gun crime I'm sure my right awful friend will be happy to meet her mr. bone Thank You mr. speaker following the question from the right um remember forget lien could I agree entirely what he said the problem the Prime Minister's done more than anyone in this house to end the terrible modern-day slavery but we have one problem sir and that is the treatment of child victims they are put in the care of local authorities and as the Honourable member said they are then re traffic could we look at having a system like we do for adult we're safe homes of providing centrally not by local government so retracting could not occur for a minister well my friend follows up the I don't remember forgetting on important point about these child victims of trafficking and I would certainly look at the issue that he has raised the independent child advocates that I referred to in my response to my honorable men forget Ling was one way in which we feel we can give greater support to these child victims to ensure that they we do not see them being lost to the local authorities and being retrack because he's absolutely right it is a scandal when I mean a victim goes into the care of a local authority and then somebody is able to come along and remove them from that care and take them back into into slavery order statement the Prime Minister with permission Mr Speaker I would like to make a statement on the response of the Russian first on behalf of the whole house let me pay tribute once again to the bravery and professionalism of all the emergency services doctors nurses and investigation teams who have led the response to this appalling incident and also to the fortitude of the people of Salisbury and let me reassure them that as public health England have made clear the ongoing risk to public health is low and the government will continue to do everything possible to support this historic city to recover fully mr. speaker on Monday I set out that mr. scribble and his daughter were poisoned with an Nava chock a military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia based on this capability combined with their record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations including against former intelligence officers whom they regard as legitimate targets the UK government concluded that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for this reckless and despicable act and there were only two plausible explanations either this was a direct act by the Russian State against our country or conceivably the Russian government could have lost control of a military-grade nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others mr. speaker it was right to offer Russia the opportunity to provide an explanation but their response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events they have provided no credible explanation that they that could suggest they lost control of their nerve agent no explanation as to how this agent came to be used in the United Kingdom no explanation as to why Russia has an undeclared chemical weapons program in contravention of international law instead they have treated the use of a military-grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm contempt and defiance so mr. speaker there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of mr. scribble and his daughter and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury including Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey this represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom and as I set out on Monday it has taken place against the backdrop of a well-established pattern of Russian state aggression across Europe and beyond it must therefore be met with a full and robust response beyond the actions we have already taken since the murder of mr. Litvinenko and to counter this pattern of Russian aggression elsewhere as the discussion in this house on Monday made clear it is essential that we now come together with our allies to defend our security to stand up for our values and to send a clear message to those who would seek to undermine them this morning i chaired a further meeting of the National Security Council where we agreed immediate actions to dismantle the Russian espionage network in the UK urgent work to develop new powers to tackle all forms of hostile state activity and to ensure that those seeking to carry out such activity cannot enter the UK and additional steps to suspend all planned high-level contacts between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation let me start with the immediate actions mr. speaker the house will recall that following the murder of mr. Litvinenko the UK expelled for diplomats under the Vienna Convention the United Kingdom will now expel 23 Russian diplomats who have been identified as undeclared intelligence officers they have just one week to leave this will be the single biggest expulsion for over 30 years and it reflects the fact that this is not the first time that the Russian state has acted against our country through these expulsion 'z we will fundamentally degrade russian intelligence capability in the UK for years to come and if they seek to rebuild it we will prevent them from doing so second we will urgently develop proposals for new legislative powers to hardened our defenses against all forms of hostile state activity this will include the addition of a targeted power to detain those suspected of hostile state activity at the UK border this power is currently only permitted in relation to those suspected of terrorism and I have asked the Home Secretary to consider whether there is a need for new counter espionage powers to clamp down on the full spectrum of hostile activities of foreign agents in our country mr. speaker as I set out on Monday we will also table a government amendment to the sanctions bill to strengthen our powers to impose sanctions in response to the violation of human rights in doing so we will play our part in an international effort to punish those responsible for the sorts of abuses suffered by Sergey Magnitsky and I hope as with all the measures I am setting out today that this will command cross-party support mr. Speaker we will also make full use of existing powers to enhance our efforts to monitor and track the intentions of those traveling to the UK who could be engaged in activity that threatens the security of the UK and of our of our allies so we will increase checks on private flights customs and freight we will freeze Russian state assets wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents and led by the National Crime Agency we will continue to bring all the capabilities of UK law enforcement to bear against serious criminals and corrupt elites there is no place for these people or their money in our country mr. speaker let me be clear while our response must be robust it must also remain true to our values as a liberal democracy that believes in the rule of law many Russians have made this country their home abide by our laws and make an important contribution to our country which we must continue to welcome but to those who seek to do us harm my message is simple you are not welcome here mr. speaker let me turn to our bilateral relationship as I said on Monday we have had a very simple approach to Russia engage but beware and I continue to believe it is not in our national interest to break off all dialogue between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation but in the aftermath of this appalling act against our country this relationship cannot be the same so we will suspend all planned high-level bilateral contacts between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation this includes revoking the invitation to foreign minister Lavrov to pay a reciprocal visit to the UK and confirming there will be no attendance by ministers or indeed members of the royal family at this summer's World Cup in Russia finally Mr Speaker we will deploy a range of tools from across the full breadth of our national security apparatus in order to counter the threats of hostile state activity while I have set out some of these measures today members on all sides will understand that there are some that cannot be shared publicly for reasons of national security and of course there are other measures we stand ready to deploy at any time should we face further Russian provocation mr. speaker none of the actions we take are intended to damage legitimate activity or prevent contacts between our populations we have no disagreement with the people of Russia who have been responsible for so many great achievements throughout their history many of us looked at a post-soviet Russia with hope we wanted a better relationship and it is tragic that President Putin has chosen to act in this way but we will not tolerate the threat to life of British people and others on British soil from the Russian government nor will we tolerate such a flagrant breach of Russia's international obligations mr. speaker as I set out on Monday the United Kingdom has not stand alone in confronting Russian aggression in the last 24 hours I have spoken to President Trump Chancellor Merkel and president Makarov we have agreed to cooperate closely in responding to this barbaric act and to coordinate our efforts to stand up for the rules-based international order which Russia seeks to undermine I will also speak to other allies and partners in the coming days and I welcome the strong expressions of support from NATO and from partners across the European Union and beyond later today in New York the UN Security Council will hold open consultations where we will be pushing for a robust international response we have also notified the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons about Russia's use of this nerve agent and we are working with the police to enable the OPCW to independently verify our analysis mr. speaker this was not just an act of attempted murder in Salisbury nor just an act against the UK it is an affront to the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons and it is an affront to the rules-based system on watch which we and our international partners depend we will work with our allies and partners to confront such actions wherever they threaten our security at home and abroad and I commend this statement to the house Thank You mr. speaker I would like to thank the Prime Minister for advanced sight of her statement and echo absolutely her words about the service of our emergency in public services the attack in Salisbury was an appalling act of violence nerve agents are abominable if used in any war it is utterly reckless to use them in a civilian environment this attack in Britain has concerned our allies in the European Union NATO and the UN and their words of solidarity have strengthened our position diplomatically our response as a country must be guided by the rule of law support for international agreements and respect for human rights so when it comes to the use of chemical weapons on British soil it is essential that the government works with the United Nations to strengthen its chemical weapons monitoring system and involves the office of the prohibition of chemical weapons the Prime Minister said on Monday either this was a direct act by the Russian States or the Russian government lost control of their potentially catastrophic lead damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get in the hands of others our response must be both decisive and proportionate and based on clear evidence if the government believes that it is still a possibility that Russia negligently lost control of a military-grade nerve agent what action is being taken through the OPCW with our allies I welcome the fact the police are working with the OPCW and has the Prime Minister taken the necessary steps under the Chemical Weapons Convention to make a formal request for evidence from the Russian government under Article 9.2 how has she responded to the Russian government's request for a sample of the agent used in the Salisbury attack to run its own tests has high-resolution trace analysis been run on a sample of the nerve agent and has that revealed any evidence as to the location of its production or the identity of its perpetrators and can the Prime Minister update the house on what conversations if any she's had with the Russian government and while and while suspending planned high-level contacts does the Prime Minister agree that it is essential to maintain a robust dialogue with Russia in the interests of our own and wider international security with many countries mr. speaker speaking out speaking out alongside us the circumstances demand that we build an international consensus to address the use of chemical weapons we should urge our international allies to join us and call on Russia to reveal without delay full details of its chemical weapons program to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons it is as we on these benches have expressed before a matter of huge regret that our country's diplomatic capacity has been stripped back with cuts of 25 percent five years it is mr. speaker it is mr. speaker the right honorable gentleman must be heard will be advocate opportunity for colleagues on both sides of the house to him to put questions members must be heard Jeremy Corbyn I couldn't understand a word of what the foreign sector II just said mr. speaker but his behavior demeans his office it is in moments it's in moments such as these that governments realize how vital strong diplomacy and political pressure are for our security and national interest the measures we take have to be effective not just for the long-term security of our citizens but to secure a world free of chemical weapons so can the Prime Minister outline what discussions she has had with our partners in the European Union NATO in the UN and what willingness there was to take multilateral action while the poisonings mr. speaker of Sergey and Yulia scruple are confronting us today what efforts are being made by the government to reassess the death of mr. scruples daughter Ludmila who died in 2012 and the deaths of his eldest brother and son who have both died in the past two years we're a duty to speak out against the abuse of human rights by the Putin government and its supporters both at home and abroad and I joined many others in this house in paying tribute to the many campaigners in Russia for human rights and justice and democracy in that country and mr. speaker and Mr Speaker we must do more to address the dangers posed by the state's relationship with unofficial mafia-like groups and corrupt oligarchs we must also we must also expose the flows of ill-gotten cash between the Russian States and billionaires who become stupendously rich by looting their country and subsequently use London to protect their wealth we welcomed the Prime Minister's to statement today clearly committing to support the Magnitsky amendments and implementing them as soon as possible as we on this side have long pushed for mr. speaker yesterday Nikolay gush cough a Russian exile who was close friends with the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found dead in his London home what reassurance can she give to citizens of Russian origin in Britain that they are safe here mr. speaker the events in Salisbury earlier this month are abominable and have been rightly condemned right across the house Britain has to build Britain has to build a consensus with our allies and we support the Prime Minister in mr. speaker we support the Prime Minister in taking multilateral action and firm action to ensure we strengthen the Chemical Weapons Convention to ensure that this dreadful appalling Act which we totally condemn never happens again in our country the gentleman raised the right honourable gentleman raised a number of questions around the nerve agents that he had been used he asked if we of we were putting together an international coalition to call on Russia to reveal the details of its chemical weapons program to the OPCW that is indeed what we did we gave the Russian government the opportunity move through the day March that my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary delivered to the Russian ambassador here in London earlier this week to do just that they have not done so and it is he's raised a number of questions he asked about the corrupt elites and money going through London as I said in my statement led by the National Crime Agency we will continue to bring all the capabilities of UK law enforcement to bear against serious criminals and corrupt elites there is no place for these people or their money in our country and that work is ongoing he talked about getting an international consensus together as as I have said I've spoken to Chancellor Merkel to President Trump to President macron others have also expressed their support yen Stoltenberg the NATO secretary-general said we stand in solidarity with our allies in the United Kingdom and those responsible for though both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it must face appropriately serious consequence is the NATO Council has depressed deep concern at the first defensive use of a nerve agent on Alliance territory since NATO's foundation and allies agreed the attack was a clear breach of international norms and agreements and Donald Tusk the president of the EU Council said I expressed my full solidarity with p.m. Therese May in the face of the brutal attack inspired most likely by Moscow I'm ready to put the issue on next week's European Council so we will we will be doing that but I say to the right honourable gentleman this is not a question of our diplomacy of what diplomatic support we have around the world this is a question of the culpability of the Russian state and he said that we should be trying to build a consensus it was clear it's clear from the conversations I've had with allies that we have a consensus with our allies it was clear from the remarks that were made by back benches across the whole of this house on Monday that there is a consensus across the back benches of this house only sorry that the consensus does not go as far as the right honourable gentleman who could who could have taken the opportunity as the UK government has done to condemn the culpability of Russia mr. Kenneth Clark mr. speaker it it seems to me without a access to closed information that the choice of this particularly bizarre and dreadful way of killing an individual is a deliberate choice by the Russian government to put their signature on a particular killing so that other defectors are left in no doubt that it is the Russian government that will act if they're disappointed in any way by their actions now the light of that the only sensible question that the leader of the opposition asks was what consultation we propose to have with NATO the other European countries with the American government about positive action that could be taken to prevent this continuing defiance of international law with the defiance of all the rules on testing and possession of chemical weapons it's not just the question of expressing our anger about Solsbury this is actually a serious threat to the safety of the Western world and lessening to we all do something together to actually start getting the Russians to do something as opposed to simply ignore us and learn it friend is absolutely right and that is why we are not only talking to allies bilaterally but their wills I understand it be a meeting of the NATO Council tomorrow at which this issue will be considered as the president of the EU Council has said he will be putting this on the agenda of the European Union Council meeting at the end of next week and my right on role and learning friend is absolutely right while we rightly initially focus on the use of this nerve agent here in the UK and its impact on us here in the UK this is about the illegal use of chemical weapons by the Russian state and it is about an illegal program to develop in developing those chemical weapons by the Russian state and we will leave no stone unturned in order to work with our allies to sure that we respond appropriately to that DM blackford Thank You mr. speaker and let me thank the Prime Minister for an advance sight of her statement as the Prime Minister has stated the attack orden mr. skipper and his daughter was an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom mr. speaker that has to be a robust response to the use of terror on our streets we must act in a measured way to show that we will simply not tolerate this behavior and in this regard I welcome and associate with those of us in these benches with the measures contained in the statement on this matter I commit my party to working constructively with the government I am sure the house will join me with extending thanks to the police and security services who are working round-the-clock on the recent case in Salisbury mr. speaker it has been warming to see our closest friends and allies across Europe expressing solidarity and support our friends globally must join with us by standing up to this abuse of state power by Russia and I look forward to discussions in the United Nations the United Nations must speak with a clear and an unambiguous voice mr. speaker the fact that we are expelling the largest number of undeclared intelligence officers in over 30 years is welcome and as the desire to examine what can be done from a legend of perspective to defend against hostile state activity as someone who has previously supported the so-called merchants key measures I am pleased that the government is signaling action than Assyria and let me commend the actions of bill Bharata who have had the opportunity to meet previous someone that has been personally but massive risk and has stood up to the effects of Russian state power mr. speaker financial sanctions are welcome and we must redouble our efforts against any money laundering by the was responsible it must be clear to the Russian authorities that we will not tolerate activities that infringe international law whilst we support the PM's actions we will continue to scrutinize them carefully and we must ensure proper scrutiny of any new proposed legislation our thoughts are with those in Russia who have suffered from abuse of state power there is no doubt that that is what we are seeing and in doing so we look forward to a time where we can engage positively for a time of peace and cooperation but the only response today must be a robust one towards the Kremlin and to Russia can I and I mr. speaker can I once again thank the right honourable gentleman for not just the tone of his response but for the comments that he has made can I reassure him that of course any legislative proposals we bring forward will have due scrutiny in this in this house can I thank him for his constructive offer to work with the government on this on this issue but it is a matter that should concern us across the whole house and can I reassure him that although I have made reference to a number of allies who had spoken in support of the United Kingdom in this others have to Canada Australia for example have also been very clear that a robust response is appropriate to this and once again I welcome the comments made by the right honourable mr. Ian Duncan Smith mr. speaker may I commend my right uncle friend for her strong leadership and in rising to this challenge as others have shown they also too in positions of leadership have risen to the challenge I'm only sorry that others in such positions have fallen well can I ask her in the conversation she's due to have with her allies and she's quite right to do she may raise with the German government the issue of the nordstrom to pipeline that they are engaged with with the Russians which will cut revenues from Ukraine and Eastern Europe and give Russia and unparalleled ability to bully those countries in the future if Russia is as we now believe a rogue state could she please try and persuade our allies in Europe and elsewhere not to treat with them and make them better off well I thank my right honourable friend and can I say to him that I think one of the things that we will be discussing with our allies is how we can ensure the the robust message about the act that has taken place on UK UK soil is consistently given and continues to be given by all our allies as regards North stream - this is a matter that is regularly discussed at the European Union Council as my right honourable friend would I suspect imagine event Cooper I welcome the Prime Minister's State her conclusion about the culpability of the Russian state is an immensely serious one and that in addition to their breaches of international law of the use of chemical weapons but also their continued disregard for the rule of law and for human rights must be met with unequivocal condemnation hi welcome folks the measures she's taken to downgrade the intelligence capability that the russian state has but also in particular the work that i no understand has started with the united nations it is important to expose russia and what they are doing within the united nations and to build the broadest possible support against them can she say a bit more about what she is tape doing on that front also thank the right honourable lady for the strength of the statement that she has just made which I know is representative of many of her right honourable and honorable friends on the back benches opposite we are taking this matter to the United Nations weak my right honorable friend the foreign secretary has already spoken to the UN secretary-general about this issue it will be part of the open discussion that is taking place tomorrow that is the start of a process of looking at this issue as I say but in as I indicated in response to my right honourable and learn it friend members rush cliff this is not just about the incident that has taken place here in the United Kingdom it is about this use of chemical weapons this illegal use of chemical weapons that has taken place and the role of the Russian state in the development of chemical weapons contrary to international law Ian Lewis mr. speaker no reasonable person can possibly doubt that the Russian government has behaved with arrogance with inhumanity and with contempt not least in failing to respond to the Prime Minister's deadline which it surely would have done if it had known it was innocent of this in welcoming the Prime Minister's expulsion of 23 diplomats who are really intelligence agencies will I ask her to make it clear that any retaliation in kind by the Russian government will be met by further expulsion possibly including even the Ambassador who spend so much time coming to talk to us in this place the moaning the poor state of Anglo Russian relations and will she accept that Russia traditionally respects strength and despises weakness and that the time has come to recognize that 2% of GDP is not enough to spend on defense when we are reverting to the sort of adversarial relationship when we used to spend a much higher proportion of GDP in ensuring that this country was well defended and I thank vulnerable friend for his remarks as I said in my statement in response to his first point there are other measures we stand ready to deploy at any time should we face further Russian provocation on and on the other point that he made of course as we have been looking through our national security capability review and are modernizing defense program review what we are doing is ensuring that for the variety and diversity of threats that this country faces we have the resources and the capabilities available to deal with those threats but of course as those threats diversify not all of them will be responded to by what is conventionally normally considered to be defense so Vincent cable and I say that I in my party fully support they Prime Minister statements can I ask what is her response to the brave leader of the Opposition in Russia Alexei Navalny who is not allowed to stand in the presidential election who has said that the most effective action the British government can take is to use its legal powers such as the unexplained wealth orders against named individuals who are critical to the Putin operation and she names in particular mr. Alesha of Smirnoff who has substantial property and sporting interests and the first Deputy Prime Minister mr. Igor Shuvalov who amongst other things owns a fourteen million pound flat overlooking the Ministry of Defense will she act I think the right honourable gentleman for the support that he has given to the actions being taken by the government can I also say to him as I did in my said in my statement that we do of course look at issues around corrupt elites we look at issues around criminal finances we look at using the tools and capabilities that are at our disposal the National Crime Agency is continuing in that work tom jugen Hart Thank You mr. speaker may I thank the Prime Minister for her impressive leadership in this matter I associate myself actually unusually with the leader of the Liberal Democrats and calling for more use of unexplained wealth orders but could I also ask her if she will use the tools at her disposal to expose the wealth of the Putin family 300 billion dollars or more has been stolen from the Russian people by that man we should expose him for what he is and not be a useful idiot hiding behind legalism of his crimes can I can I say honorable friend for his contribution and suggestion can I also say on the unexplained wealth orders of course those are tools that we do use but we have to use these properly in accordance with the rule of law following the the due processes that should take place Kendyl Mr Speaker I welcome the prime minister's statement agree with her analysis and fully support the government's actions I understand that the Foreign Office has called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council what does the Prime Minister think the result of this is likely to be given that one permanent member of the Council is engaging in unlawful attacks on another and does she share my concerns that Russians Russia's actions in this country in Ukraine and in backing Assad's murderous regime in Syria means that the current Security Council mechanism is broken I say to thank the Honourable lady for her comments and also say as I said earlier the foreign secretary did speak to the UN secretary-general yesterday and later today in New York the UN Security Council will hold initial consultations obviously Russia is a member of that Security Council but I think it's important that we continue to use the international organizations that are available to us the United Nations is a protector of the international rules-based order that's what it should be and we will be continuing to press for a robust international response Valerie Mitchell it's clear that almost unanimously across the house there is support for my right honourable friends proportionate and right response to this crisis in particular she's absolutely right to use the mechanisms of the United Nations to make clear to everyone what has happened in this case and will she also bear in mind that hidden Syria Russia has either indirectly or directly authorized and used chemical weapons and may also thank her for what she has said about the Magnitsky Amendment which many of us across the house have been working for for some time now I hope that she will give consideration for implementing the full Magnitsky amendment as it has been implemented in America and in Canada can I can i first of all say to my right honourable friend and it picks up a point that was actually made by the Cree from the previous question that this isn't simply one actually see from Russia this is a pattern of actions by Russia where they are undertaking in a variety of ways the different actions of course what you can see them doing in Syria what we've seen in doing by the illegal annexation of Crimea and their activities in the Donbass we also see their use of propaganda their attempt to interfere in elections across the continent of Europe these are all the actions that the Russian state is in is getting involved in and in response to the second point we will bring forward a government amendment to reflect the Magnitsky considerations and to ensure that we have got the strongest possible means to deal with these issues Sami Wilson welcome to the state of action which has been taken by the Prime Minister today and it's it's and contrast was the policy of appeasement that we have heard from the front bench I'm sure the people of the United Kingdom are pleased that the Prime Minister who's sitting but are standing behind up despatch-box today defending a rule of law and the citizens of this country however she has told us that she has spoken to our allies over the last couple of days perhaps you could tell us apart from words of support what actions have they committed to to ensure that first of all a meze just centered about this action and actions in the future and I can I thank the Honorable gentleman for his remarks and for the support of the DUP for the action that the government is taking on this matter and can I say to him that in relation to the actions to be taken by international allies of course they were waiting for us to announce the various actions that we were taking the decision taken by the National Security Council this morning but we are will be holding further discussions with our allies about the way in which they can support what we are doing by actions themselves this varnak grieve thank Thank You mr. Speaker I can't I early agree with the approach adopted by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in how she's responded to this outrageous attack she agree with me that the difficulty we face is not so much in getting the concurrence of our allies in agreeing on the nature of the outrage but how we are going to craft a sustained strategy so that those of us who believe in the rules-based international system can apply the necessary leverage and persuasion like russia to conform to it and the very serious risk that we run is that if we don't succeed in doing this the level of violence that Russia is going to exercise with impunity against other states and us will simply increase and that this is something which our allies in particular must have regard to if we are going to make any program is absolutely correct that this is an issue which we need to address in that wider sense because it is about the way in which the Russian state is acting it believes with impunity in a whole variety of ways the way in which it is flouting the international rules based order we must come together as allies to ensure that we are supporting that international rules based order and that we have a clicked not just a collective agreement but a collective approach which ensures that we can challenge what Russia is doing but he's also right I think one of the points I think we should be making to our allies is that this may have happened in the United Kingdom but actually it is something that could be happening in any of these states Hillary man Mr Speaker I join our others in welcoming and the measures that the Prime Minister has announced today as Russia has chosen to act against us in such an outrageous way we have to demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves given that Russia's usual response is to deny all responsibility for such actions as well as seeking the assistance of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons in identifying the sample does she intend as any member state is entitled to do to ask for that organization to carry out an investigation including an inspection of any facilities or locations in Russia where this nave urgent in all probability was produced how can I say to the right honourable gentleman that we will be talking to the OPCW about a number of ways in which not just the sample of the nerve agent used here in the United Kingdom can be independently verified but other actions that the OPCW might be able to take Sir Nicholas sans I welcome the decision of the government to refer the patient they and carefully acquired evidence in this great task attack to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons easy to her intention that their findings should be referred both to the Russians to the United Nations and to ourselves and will she consider in the light of that finding go further on unexplained wealth orders and other financial sanctions against Russia if necessary I say to my right on friend that of course we are asking the OPCW to independently verify this so that it can be clear to everyone the nature of this this nerve agent can I also say to him that as I've said earlier in response to the unexplained wealth orders these are things which we do operate we do use and we've we have introduced but we will ensure always ensure that they are done on evidence and obviously we operate according to the rule of law a Margaret Hodge welcome a prime ministers clear statement and her condemnation of the Russians and the actions she's taken and can are in particular welcomed the fact that she is adopting the Magnitsky amendment now from the government but can I say to her too much money is being laundered out of Russia and finding its way into the into the British system and there are two things she could do pretty quickly which would help to tackle that in the first place she could bring forward the public register of ownership of properties which was promised by her predecessor in 2015 and has been delayed by this government and in the second place she could increase transparency in our corporate structure so we would know who forms companies here where the money comes from and deal with it if it's illicit money brought in by unsavory people say to the right lady in relation to the issue that she's raised about the transparency in relation to property ownership and that is something that I have discussed with the Business Secretary we haven't been delaying that we do need to ensure that we get that right when we introduce it but we have been discussing the timing for introducing that because we do want to ensure we've got all the tools in our locker that we can we can use and can help us in this in the endeavor that we are engaged in Nicky Morgan 100% support the Prime Minister's statement and the actions that she is taking and to follow up just from the last question I want to put a couple on the prime minister's statement that there is no place for serious criminals and corrupt elites all their money in our country there are amendments which are sure Parliament will support but could more promise to also bear in mind that the select committees could have a real role here in teasing out information what is going on to have to tackle dirty money in this country whether in the City of London or elsewhere to bring evidence to the house that could shape amendments and actions the government could then take well can I thank my right honourable friend for her suggestion can I say that I indeed I recognized the role that select committees can play I suspect my right honourable friend has just set up a stream of work for her own Treasury select committee to undertake Bradshaw can I sure the Prime Minister that most of us on these benches fully support the measures that she and indeed some of us think they could have come a bit sooner on the wider issue of Putin's hybrid warfare against our country will she tasks the intelligence and security services to investigate Putin's influencing operations in our universities in our think tanks in our financial institutions and in our political parties he raises an important issue about the propaganda activities that are being undertaken by the Russian state and I will certainly look at the suggestions he's made mr. Simon Hall Speaker we should all be thanking God today that it's my right honourable friend in her place and on the so-called alternative I'm not expecting my right honourable friend to comment on the detail but this morning residence in my constituency hive Road in giving them saw the Metropolitan Police in the Army in place the street in lockdown removing vehicles and items linked to the Salisbury incident I'm not expecting my right honorable friend to keep overriding commentary on current operations but could she confirm two things first that she and the government and the security services are doing all that they can to keep my constituents safe and can she arrange for somebody to provide a briefing to me as the Member of Parliament as to precisely what's happening can I say to my little friend I'm very happy to do that as he will be aware the police investigation does continue and we cannot say where that investigation is going to take the police in terms of their further inquiries but I will ensure that he is provided with the beefing as a member of parliament miss Bryant I completely support everything that the Prime Minister has said today the truth is that under Putin the Russian Federation has managed to combine all the worst facets of communism and all the worst facets of rampant capitalism all wrapped up inside a national security state which keeps its people poor and kills his political can I just asked about the Russian ambassador because since he arrived here seven years ago Alexander Yakov anko he has repeatedly lied to parliamentarians he has tried to get the speaker to stop debates on Russia happening in this house he has tried to interfere in the internal elections of this house and surely to God it is time we now told him that we will order our affairs in this country not him and he can go home well I say to the right honourable gentleman he's absolutely right we will order our affairs in this country and we will not be told what to do by a Russian ambassador and I fully expect the house authorities to ensure that it is not possible for an external party such as that to interfere in elections in this house and can I also say that it's a brave man who tries to tell the Speaker of the House of Commons what to do and just add anything down I must say for the avoidance about he got absolutely nowhere with me you could be sure about that Anna Supre it's noticeable that the length and breadth of this place has completely supported not just the wise words and the leadership of the Prime Minister but also her firm actions with a notable exception of the front bench of the opposition shame or no but mr. speaker further to the question asked by children for Exeter democracy is a fundamental British value and there have been long-held concerns that Russia has been seeking to undermine and interfere in it if those concerns now turn to evidence will she take equally robust action against Russia to ensure that our great British democracy continues to be protected I'm very happy to give the assurance to my right honourable friend of the action that we take we recognize that the first duty of government is to safeguard the nation and we treat security and integrity of our democratic processes as of everything else in this country very seriously in terms of disinformation that is used by the Kremlin we know that they persistently use this to D say stabilize perceived enemies and managing this is a long-term priority for the UK will continue to work not just as a UK but to work with our international partners on efforts to were to counter this there's several Robert's alongside many colleagues in this house I speak on behalf of my party in calling for a robust and immediate response sources inform us that Russia is the UK's biggest weapons-grade nuclear substances export market this is despite several attempts at a moratorium on depleted uranium by the European Parliament and the United Nations will the Prime Minister confirm whether the UK is still exporting nuclear substances to Russia and if so surely this should be among the very first sanctions imposed and I thank the Honourable lady for the remarks that she's made and for the support that she has given from her party for the actions that the that the government is taking what we have been talking about today of course is the use of a nerve agent of a chemical weapon on UK soil and the blatant flouting of the international rules-based order and the legal structure around those use that use of chemical weapons by the Russian stage John Hayes speaker we're not my server security minister and my writer on from was Home Secretary I became aware both of her outstanding determination and dedication and of the commitment and expertise of our security services and the police that deal with counterterrorism she knows as the house knows that that is led for the Metropolitan Police but of course this event happen in Salisbury could have happened in Berkshire or Lincoln fear will she art the Home Secretary look at whether our local police forces are given the dynamic nature of these threats equipped and informed adequately to deal with them in the first instance as former Security Minister of course my right honourable friend has a particular understanding of these of these issues can I I say to him that of course the ability to bring in the capabilities of the counterterrorism police who of course don't just operate in the Metropolitan Police as he knows but have regional bases around the country as well is part of the layered structure that we have in relation to peace forces but I'm sure my right honourable friend will be making sure that the police look at the the immediate response that they had to this incident to ensure that we certainly don't want to see an incident of this type happening again on on United Kingdom soil and that's why we're giving a very clear message to the to the Russian state but we do want to ensure that all of these forces are aware of threats that they may face Mike gates speaker the Prime Minister's words were appropriate measured and correct and she has my full support she mentioned dirty money from Russia can she look again at the role of the tax havens internationally including those in British overseas territories and Crown Dependencies I thank the gentleman for his for his remarks can I say to him that as he knows we have been making taking a number of measures in relation to financial activities in the British overseas territories and dependencies and we continue to press on those and of course we have enhanced our ability to deal with these issues here in relation to economic crime through the formation of the national economic crime center which I'm pleased to say obviously having formed the National Crime Agency we have now set up that national economic crime center as part of the NCA which brings a number of capabilities together to deal with these issues Alfond Thank You mr. speaker might my constituent Apollo will strongly I think be reassured by the way you are guarding the nation's security and could I ask my honorable friends who condemned the remarks of President Putin who attacked Jews and other nations for the meddling in the United States elections and could I ask given that she's also said about possible rogue use of these chemical weapons what is the prospect of such chemical weapons ending up in the hands of extreme Islamists and I say to my humble friend what first of all I also condemned the remarks that he has referred to that were made in relation to certain communities in the United States can I say to my own well friend in relation to the second part of his question or what we are talking about here is a nerve agent that was developed as part of a chemical weapons program by the Russian state and I think that will give him a clear message in relation to to this Dericks way Thank You speaker can I please support what the prime minister said in the statement and also for the actions she outlined today mr. speaker can ask the Prime Minister this I have some concerns about whether we have in place a proper strategy combat chemical weapons attacks against this project particularly small tail attacks and it's joined up with both security services governments and the Armed Forces but their prime minister could be some reassurance all tell me where that achievement work is continuing to improve that yes well we do have obviously this is an issue that we do look at and we do have a strategy in place but we will of course ensure given what has happened we will review that we will look again to make sure that we have the best possible opportunity to to ensure that this could not happen again mr. crisp in blunt welcoming the prime minister's statement as almost everyone else has can I join with the right on remember for veterans feel about the importance of the international rule of law and say that this is a very important moment of decision for China to decide which side she is going to sit on in this arrangement and can I urge my right honourable friend to make sure we take the most energetic steps to ensure that China stands with the rest of the civilized world on the side of law and responsibility thank you for raising the issue in this way we want to see the maximum possible adherence to the international rules-based order across the whole world in different contexts this is a matter that I raised when I was in China recently this is an extremely important parliamentary occasion and I think it's understandable that very large numbers of members should want to question the Prime Minister can I very politely suggest to colleagues that they should seek to ensure that their questions are as six inked as the Prime Minister's replies have been and that way we might get through a very great many more quickly than we otherwise would Chris Leslie measures the Prime Minister's announced and their condemnation of what is increasingly looking like a rogue state on this question of the integrity of the United Nations Security Council we must now begin to talk about reform Russia cannot be allowed to simply sit pretty thumbing its nose at the rest of the world community and feeling it is immune from the rule of law internationally will she initiate that sort of reform discussion with the general secretary I thank once again thank the right honourable gentleman for the remarks he's made today and the support he's given to the government as he did on on Monday Oh in relation to the question we do talk to the United Nations about reform of the United Nations in a whole variety of ways of course any decision they catch-22 if you like is that any decision that would might be taken in the Security Council to to reform it of course could be subject to a veto by Russia who are sitting there but I think but the point has been raised not just by the right honourable gentleman but by others and this is something that we will look at Prime Minister has underlined to the house that the Russian state has either been utterly reckless at best or directly complicit at worst in the deployment of a harmful substance on our soil can I ask her in the statement she said that she would be taking emotions to hardened our defenses against hostile state activity with that in mind will she ensure that appropriate balance is provided between counterterrorism and counter espionage to ensure that our excellent security and intelligence agencies are appropriately focused to combat and directly disrupt those who would cause harm in our country can I say to my right honourable friend who also as a former security minister has a particular knowledge and understanding of these issues that I entirely take the point that he has made and we do indeed we do constantly ensure that the balance is right between counter terrorism and counter espionage and we will of course continue to ensure that that balance is maintained properly that mcfadden bonding with strength and resolve when your country is under threat is an essential component of political leadership there is a label tradition that understands a and i've been understood by prime ministers of all parties who have stood in that despite force that means when chemical weapons are used we need more than words but deeds and can i ask the prime minister then what more she can do to enhance our solidarity with our allies particularly at a time when there are nationalist forces trying to drive wedges between democratic countries some of those forces but unsupported by the russians all say to the right honourable gentleman that he is of course absolutely right that there is a strong tradition in the labour party of recognising the importance of action acting in the national interest and acting when our national security is under threat and we have seen that from governments we've seen that from governments of all complexions over the years in relation to the point about the international activity and and the deeds that we need to take it is right we will be continuing to talk we have been speaking to our allies even before this event took place about the ways in which we could deal and address some of the activities and actions that Russia is taking across the continent of Europe and elsewhere but we will of course redouble those efforts now John Whittingdale that's my right friend agreed one of the best assets we have against Russian disinformation and propaganda is the BBC World Service will she look at ways in which we can extend the reach of world service perhaps by incorporating world television and does she also agree that we need to be very careful not to give any pretext however unjustified for the Russians to take action against BBC and other free media outlets I would I would hope that the Russian state would be prepared to accept the importance of free media sadly some from all two things that we heard last night that may not continue that may not be the case but my right honorable friend is right the the broadcasting of the BBC of the World Service is an important element of the reach that the United Kingdom can have but it's an important part of actually helping Pete those people who believe in democracy and the rule of law and free speech and an expression to have an outlet which is doing just that I wasn't Thewlis Mr Speaker I was glad to hear the Prime Minister mentioned the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill and I welcome the commitment to the magnetosphere Amendment but she will understand that many a peak slps and LL peace are fill our money unengaged the money laundering from Russia yeah Azerbaijan Georgia and Ukraine through this country will she speak to cabinet colleagues and also look at bringing forward amendments to the sanctions done on the anti-money laundering bill to tackle these corrupt elites as she puts it because my laundering is happening via Companies House at the moment yeah I think we got the thrust of it fatally honorable lady the question of money laundering is one that we do take very seriously we have been working for some time now both withdraw enforcement but also with the financial sector on ways in which we can improve the action that we're taking against against money laundering and this is one of the things that I expect the national economic crime center to be looking at the page Leslie Steven crab give Mr Speaker strongly welcome the action at my right honourable friend is announced today and one way that Russia seeks to extend its influence in Europe is by building relationships of energy dependence is my rightful friend aware that recently Britain has started to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas but does she agree with me that Britain shouldn't provide a market for Russian gas if we do need to bring an extra LNG imports then we have allies like Qatar Malaysia Australia who are more than willing to sell excess can I can I reassure my right honourable friend that when we are looking to our gas supplies we are indeed looking to other countries very no care can I say salute Prime Minister I am another one who supports the statement that she's made today as a strong advocate for the defense and security of our country can I also draw attention to something I don't want to get lost what the prime minister said which was while our response must be robust it must also remain true to our values and as such with the Prime Minister perhaps a little bit about something that I think she's done which is not to say that we're going to ban Russia today which actually I think is a strong point to make this country believes in a free media we're not frightened of it well here are pinions that are against this but we also believe in the rule of law and democracy we do believe in the rule of law and and democracy and we do believe in free media of course the question of the status of Russia today in broadcasting in the United Kingdom is not a matter for the government it is a matter for the independent Ofcom - to consider Richard Graham is not with the Russian people but with the Russian state that has sponsored murder on our streets today we've heard absolute solidarity from across the Western world and most political parties but what statement of supporters my right honourable friend received from the one political party which gives unequivocal a hundred percent backing for the leader of the Opposition the Communist Party of Great Britain I have to say - I have to say - my honourable friend I don't believe I have received any such statement from the Communist Party of Great Britain although I did notice I did notice that I think a matter of one or two weeks ago they did say that they weren't going to be standing candidates against the where the Labour Party was standing and that they now felt more comfortable than working with the Labour Party so every day they strongly welcomed the prime minister's statement but a urja to go further and like others use energy policy as a new way of attacking this Russian threat well there are significant British energy interests in Russia and we will acknowledge that can you confirm that Putin's military and intelligence assets are largely primary funded by the sale of Russian fossil fuels can I therefore commend her to look at the EU energy security strategy which is largely written in London and is reducing Europe's dependency on Russian fossil fuels the the point that the right honorable gentleman makes which has been made by other members across the across the house is about the extension to which Russia uses its energy as a means to influence and to have an impact on those countries that are in receipt of it and also the finances that it provides from watering is an important one and I can assure him that as we continue we will be continuing to discuss with the European Union not just our energy security but that wider energy security issue the other house members of multilateral parliamentary organizations with my like the Council of Europe and the native promontory assembly where my right honourable friend agreed that a way we can help get behind her leadership in the government's position on this is to when we attend events to get the message across to explain the policies of this government to explain what has happened and why our allies should be supporting us say to Mike Donovan I think he's raised an extremely valuable point and I welcome that suggestion and would encourage him and house two speakers one for the nation and she will be reassured to hear that a clear majority of Labour MPs along side the leaders of every other party support the firm stance which she is taking is she prepared that this situation will probably get more difficult before it gets better and is she prepared to stay the course to face down this international bully and wrecker of our liberty and the rule of law across the world I think the Honourable gentleman for the remarks that eNOS made today as indeed he made very strong statement on Monday in this house as well can I assure him that I and this government will stay the course as I said in my statement we recognize the maybe a further Russian provocation if there is we have further measures that we can deploy in relation to that but I think it is important that we and we will be encouraging our international allies to do this to recognize that this is an important moment to stand up and say to Russia no you cannot do this so Desmond Swain Russian economy is a fraction but their expenditure on offensive capability a multiple of ours is there a lesson there well can I say to my right honourable friend that of course we do constantly look at the resources that we are putting in to ensure our national security which of course is assured across a number of departments in government and we continue to do so Luciana bersia he mr. speaking can I welcome the Prime Minister Sir applause response which he sets out today further to the confirmation that no Minister or member of the royal family will be attending the World Cup this summer does she believe that this sort of should also extend to senior FA officials and will she ask our NATO and EU allies to join us in this endeavor say I think the attendance and the earth at sporting events and is a matter for the sporting Thorat is it is matter them they will be aware of the statement that I have made today they will be aware that we are saying that no ministers all members of the royal family will be attending the the World Cup and I'm sure they want to be considering their position after nigel evans as chair of the inter-parliamentary Union last year I led a delegation to st. Petersburg and was met with great warmth and hospitality by many Russian people will she stress that opposition is not with them it is with their appalling leadership and also that the Russian ambassador's made it clear that we can now expect retaliation will she send a clear signal to him and Moscow that the United Kingdom will not be threatened first will say to my right honourable friend I'm grateful to fought to him for the remarks that he has made and I think last night I saw the Russian ambassador being quoted as saying that Russia was not a a country that accepted ultimatums well I can say to my right honourable friend and others the United Kingdom is not a country that accepts threats and we will stand up against the peoples of the Russian Federation who after all are living under Putin's dictatorship all the time inevitably the action that has to be taken against Putin will make it more difficult for organizations that seek to maintain good relations with the ordinary people not the Russian Federation as there anything more the government can do to help these organizations to continue the good work even file for invoking war stepped and robust sanctions against the teeth of leader I think what is what is important that both in my statement and this was the point my right honorable friend made in his previous question that we are very clear that we have no argument with the Russian people it is with the Russian state it is with the Russian government and fair actions that we are concerned and I think in the in the response that we give it is important that we make that clear not just in our words but in our actions and that's why what I've talked about today is a response that affects the Russians State and the Russian government and not the Russian people John Baron the longer-term given the actions of the Russian state and the president Putin hasn't the time now come to have a fundamental reassessment of our defense spending in collaboration preferably with our allies but alone if not I'd say to the my humble friend as he will know we are one of the limited number of countries within NATO that maintains our commitment to to pursue spending 2% of our GDP on defense we do have as I'm shorties aware the modernizing defense program that is being undertaken at the moment alongside the national security capability review it is important that we are able to deal with a variety of threats that we face but I would say to my honourable friend as I have to other members of this house that in looking at how we deal with those threats not all of them will be dealt with in a way that would conventionally be considered as a matter to the Ministry of Defense the Prime Minister has rightly said that the attacks in Britain have been part of an ongoing contempt of contempt of the rule of law and contempt of our values there has also been a contempt of our alliances both political and military in moving forward will the Prime Minister work with those political and military alliances so that together we have a root and branch removal of Russian interference in our political our education and our financial institutions let this be a barker no more now they will fear what we will do to get back on the interference they have shown us thank you I thank the Honourable lady for the commitment she has shown as a parliamentarian to the alliance we have through NATO which is very important to us is the bedrock of European defence libels certainly say that we will continue to work through those alliances to ensure that we are sending a very clear message that this is not acceptable Francois mr. speaker can I commend the Prime Minister on her decisive and vigorous action in response to what was after all an attack on the United Kingdom in some ways that had flashes of the Iron Lady about it but it was also in stark contrast to the attitude of the leader of the Opposition who simply could not bring himself to condemn Russia for this outrageous he simply couldn't do it and is that not because he remains at heart what he has always been a Sindhi badge wearing apologists for the Russian state can can can I say to a little friend I think the people will take their own conclusions from what they have heard today but I can also say to my own girlfriend that I'm sure key as I do take a great reassurance from the positive messages of support that have come from the labor back benches fill well son our way of life in this country and in the West is based on democracy human rights in the rule of law and should be defended held opinions have been expressed everybody can consult the record and I understand that there is an intensity of feeling but the Honorable gentleman of a sedge field must have his question Phil Wilson we have life in this country and in the West is based on human rights democracy and the rules the rule of law it should be defended and that's why the Prime Minister is right to bring forward these sanctions against the state but but the last year life doesn't actually believe in those principles can the Prime Minister give a commitment to come back to the house if she feels the need for further consideration of sanctions should be made the the honorable gentleman's raised an important point I did say in my statement that we had further measures that we might wish to deploy if we were subject to further Russian provocation and of course if we choose to do so I will come back to this house sequester virtue as I speak it does my rise on boyfriend except that the actions of the Russian Federation are totally incompatible with membership of the Council of Europe which believes in democracy human rights and the rule of law will my right honourable friend therefore ensure that we can expel Russia from the Council of Europe as a reprisal because it's continuing membership of the Council of Europe seems to find the face of our commitment to those important values my offenders may raise an important point can simply say to them I don't think it's within the pants only of the United Kingdom to expel Russia from the Council of Europe but as we will have heard our right honourable friend the member for Newberry making the point that members of this house who are members of such multilateral groupings should I think be making every effort to make the point about the illegitimate activity that has been undertaken by Russia today and the measured measures that she has a matter which will only be strengthened if our allies take similar action can she say more about NATO and whether we'll be bringing together you
