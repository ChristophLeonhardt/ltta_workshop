TODAY CHURCHES ACROSS AMERICA CELEBRATED A NEW SUPREME COURT RULING THAT WOULD OPEN THE WAY FOR SOME TAXPAYER MONEY TO GO TO CHURCH PROJECTS. TODAY WE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT ONE IN PARTICULAR, THE TRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH. WE WANT TO START FROM THE BEGINNING AND SHOW YOU THE BATTLE THEY WAGED. THEY WANTED TO RUBBERIZE IT FOR SAFETY REASONS. AS WE KNOW IT IS REALLY ROUGH ON CHRISTIANS IN AMERICA. JOHN ROBERTS SAID THIS. I BELIEVE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON TO NOT BE DECEPTIVE WHEN THEY USE THE PHRASE ODIOUS TO THE CONSTITUTION. BUT HE IS A FAN OF THIS. SONIA SOTOMAYOR READ ALOUD HER DISSENTING OPINION. THAT IS A GREAT TURN OF PHRASE THERE. THIS MONEY WILL NOW EFFECTIVELY, RATHER THAN HAVING TO RAISE AND SPEND IT SELF, EVEN IF THE SCHOOL AND THE PLAYGROUND IS NOT A PART OF WORSHIP, THAT IS A FINANCIAL BENEFIT GOING TO THAT CHURCH. BEFORE I GET TO MY ACTUAL COMMENT, LET'S HAVE FUN AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORD RUBBERIZE IS FUNNY. IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO SAY OTHER SCHOOLS ARE GETTING PLAYGROUND, WHY CAN'T THE CHURCH? BUT WE DON'T SPEND TAXPAYER MONEY ON CHURCHES OR TEMPLES OR MOSQUES. OF COURSE THE NATIONAL EXTENSION OF THAT IS THE PLAYGROUND, OR THE DOOR. SO OBVIOUSLY YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE WHICH IS THAT IT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL RELIGIONS, AND THAT IS WHERE SOME CONSERVATIVES MIGHT GO ñ MUSLIM COMMUNITY CENTERS ARE PROBABLY VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A MESS. THERE IS NO END TO THAT. EVERYONE ELSE GETS FEATURES- SO JUST REMEMBER THE PRINCIPLES, IF YOU HAVE ANY AND YOU SHOULD APPLY IT EQUALLY DOT IN THIS CASE, THERE IS A REASON WHY THE FOUNDING FATHERS SET THIS REPUBLIC UP IN A WAY THAT SAID THAT WE SHALL NOT MIX STATE AND CHURCH. YES, IT MAY SEEM SILLY TO DENY THOSE POOR KIDS A NICE RUBBERIZED PLAYGROUND, BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE. IT SET THE PRECEDENT, THAT IS WHY WE ARE CONCERNED AND WHY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAPPY TODAY ARE HAPPY. THEY ARE NOT HAPPY BECAUSE OF SOME RUBBERIZATION GOING ON. THERE IS A FOOTNOTE THAT THIS ATTEMPTS TO SAY THIS A SPECIFIC. SO THEORETICALLY THIS DOES NOT NEED TO SET A PRECEDENT. I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT. THAT IS INTERESTING. SOME OF THE SO-CALLED LIBERAL JUSTICES ALSO VOTED FOR THIS. ONE THEORY IS, THEY DID SO THAT SO THEY CAN GET THAT FOOTNOTE PUT IN. IF THAT IS TRUE, WHY ARE ALL THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN THE COUNTRY CELEBRATING TODAY? THEY THINK WE JUST TRICKED THE LIBERALS, THAT FOOTNOTE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. AND THEN ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS GET FIVE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES TO QUOTE THE CASE LATER AND THEY ARE DONE WITH IT. IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE CAN TREAT CONSERVATIVES INTO BEING AGAINST THE SAYING THAT THEY RUBBERIZING OF A PLAYGROUND IS PART OF A CONTINUED WAS A VACATION OF AMERICAN CHILDREN? WHEN I GREW UP I DIDN'T NEED NO RUBBER. IT'S A BAD DAY FOR PEOPLE ñ IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR OWN RELIGION AND PROTECTING IT, YOU WOULD NOT BE IN FAVOR OF THIS. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CARE ABOUT AN IRRATIONAL RULE OF LAW YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED AND YOU WOULD NOT TRUST A CONSERVATIVE WHEN HE SAYS IT ONLY APPLIES TO THIS.
