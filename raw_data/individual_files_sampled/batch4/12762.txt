you know what I hate hoverboards you know why I hate them they don't hover why do they call them hoverboards if they just roll around if I sold you a flying car and all it did was drive down the street like any other car wouldn't you come to me and say this is not a flying car because it doesn't fly now give me my money back or I'm going to hit you over the head with this stupid non hovering rolling board I mean if a man put on a dress and had breast implants would you call him a woman wouldn't you just call him a strangely-shaped man and a dress and what if he was on a hoverboard would he suddenly become a woman flying around wouldn't he just be a dressed up man with silicon in his chest standing on a wheeled board in the women's bathroom making all the real women uncomfortable by rolling around shouting look at me I'm hovering and I'm also a woman or let's say there was a religion and let's say almost every terrorist on earth practiced this religion and let's say almost every war on earth involved this religion and let's say almost every country where most of the people had this religion was plagued by violence would you call that the religion of peace of course not if a man from that religion who was strapped with dynamite came up to you on a hoverboard and said hi I'm a man hovering off the ground from the religion of peace wouldn't you run for your life because not one word he said was true plus he was strapped with dynamite you bet you would or think about this if a highly paid engineer loses his job and after months of searching he finally finds a menial job working one hour a week for $20 the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says congratulations that man is employed then the unemployment rate goes down and Barack Obama says look I brought down the unemployment rate I'm a great president and by the way I'm floating above the ground on my hoverboard would you call that engineer employed would you call that low employment rate would you call that President great what would you say if that's employment then I am the queen of Romania flying on my hoverboard and swallowing prescription opiates by the handful because I'm making $20 a week and when you look around at a country whether president passes laws without Congress where unelected bureaucrats can tell me whether I can cut down a tree in my own yard or if I have to bake a cake for a wedding I don't agree with and anyone who is not in favor of those things as shouted down and knocked off social media would you call that country America would you call it stinky Obama Vil or nasty Washington land or stupid elite world I know what I'd call it I call it hoverboard nation and I'm looking forward to coming back down to earth trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew

excellent to each other guys because you will be happy if you are alright it's Martin Luther King Day and you know what that means it means that Democrats are cynically going to play racial politics all day long and we will have Nobel Prize winning cultural commentator Michael Knowles here to talk about one aspect of Martin Luther King that the left doesn't want to talk about at all I think Michael shared the Nobel Prize with Martin Luther King I think it's the same year yeah all right so John Lewis is leading the charge as we now have to call him we can't just call him you know representative John Lewis we have to call him Civil Rights icon John now it's a guy I want to be fair the guy actually was a civil rights leader during the MLK days which is now a long time ago a lifetime ago but he has been playing this up to use this politically ever since and he did this thing last week that I just thought was appalling where he testified against the appointment of Senator sessions as Attorney General and he made this speech about all the old days being attacked with dogs and you know we had that don't let us quit me a little he gets his little trim trim low in his voice let us go back you know that's been a senator for 20 years what does he you know just going back through he's like the guy yeah he's a good solid sound civil rights record they wants to pick for attorney general but so now sessions MLK day he pushes the envelope he's on with Chuck Todd and he pushes it even further do you plan on trying to forge a relationship with Donald Trump you know I believe in the givenness I believe in tremendo work that people it would be hard it would be very difficult I don't see this president he led as a legitimate president you do not consider an illegitimate president why is that I think the Russians participated and happen this man get elected and they have destroyed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton I don't plan to attend a inauguration it would be the first one run this process I've been in the Congress you cannot be at home with something don't you feel that is wrong that's myself you know there's gonna send a big message to a lot of people in this country that you don't believe he's a legitimate president I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians and others to help him getting like that that's not right that's not fair that's not the open democratic process okay I mean by the way if a republican did the Soudan democrat they'd go nuts but they're comparing it to trump questioning obama's birth certificate that's what the Democrat that's the Democrat are given of course Trump who never met a buzz saw that he didn't walk into face first he responded but tweet a series of tweets one tweet is never enough Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in horrible shape and falling apart not to mention crime-infested rather than falsely complaining about the election results all talk talk talk no action or results sad now of course it does to be fair that that is a little unfair Louis's district which I think like his Atlanta basically so he's got he's got all kinds of people in it and all that stuff but you know obviously very offended but the point the point is this Martin Luther King Day this is this is going to be huge the fact that they are going to marshal the black there what they feel is their black support their african-american support not just in politics but also in the media which is of course just the Democrat you know they're just Democrats spokesman the reason this is important is listen to this this is the Obama record okay the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate for black Americans across the board has slipped from sixty three point two percent to sixty one point seven percent down 2.4% the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate these people in the labor force for black teenagers also sag during Obama's tenure the percentage of black Americans struggling below the poverty line has advanced according to the most recent Census Bureau data from twenty five point eight in two thousand nine to twenty six point two in 2014 up 1.6 percent real median income among black households during those years according to the Census Bureau sank from thirty five thousand nine hundred and fifty four dollars to thirty five thousand three hundred ninety eight dollars down one point five percent the number of black food stamp participants has exploded it's a 58.2% also from Obama's oath of office through the fourth quarter of 2015 the percentage of black American swooned ohms foundered down 9.1% on top of this in a recent Washington post/abc News poll 63 percent of Americans think race relations are generally bad shortly after Obama took office the number was 22% this presidency has been disastrous for race relations and has been disastrous for blacks and don't you know don't think black people don't know it now listen they love Obama of course they love Obama that's human nature you know when when John Kennedy was the first Irish Catholic elected president there were Irish people in this country who had they had pictures in their household they had Jesus they had the Pope they had the Virgin Mary a saint maybe having his head cut off and John F Kennedy that was the you know the panoply of pictures they had in there and of course that's human nature I mean we're everybody's like that don't think you know I don't think that like blacks are supposed to like exempt themselves from human nature but the important thing is because of this they know now the Democrat Party knows they've lost this as Obama walks away they are betting their for the Democrats are betting their future on demographics okay they are betting it on race they are betting it on the fact that they're going to be more and more minorities in this country as the years go by and they are trying to make sure that these people never become you know e pluribus unum out of the many one Americans they are convinced remember this is an incredibly racist strategy this is saying that these people will never vote their economic interest they'll never vote as Americans you know the side with a white guy who's their fellow American they're betting on this they're betting on it and that means they have to make it happen have to keep black people angry they have to keep them feeling like victims and by the way you know you can bet that the media are gonna jump on this and pile on this and they already have let's listen Rand Paul went on with I think he was on with I'm not sure who was interviewing oh it's Jake Tapper okay and tapper is is giving him the whole thing he's given the whole Democrat parade of the icon John Lewis you know I've worked with John Lewis met him several one of the things people are taking issue with is not the question about whether John Lewis is immune from criticism obviously he's a artists and Democrat and he said presidents like Trump is illegitimate certainly lots of room to criticize there in terms of what he's saying a few days before the inaugural but the question of describing his district as crime-infested urging him to focus on burning inner cities and referring to this man who you refer to as an icon accurately as all talk no action I think on Martin Luther King Day weekend I think that struck a lot of people as a little tone-deaf including many reports one sided sometimes in Jeff Sessions you know nomination hearings there were three African American legislators Cory Booker John Lewis and I think Cedric Richmond came forward and decided to testify against Jeff Sessions but there were also three African Americans who had worked with him and known him for years and years who testified in his favor so I think we shouldn't when things involve race it gets very very sensitive all of us or none of us actually want to be considered to be the racially insensitive and so it's a very very important subject but I think we shouldn't we shouldn't ignore that people are partisan so John Lewis is a partisan I mean that that is the key thing John Lewis has been using this stuff you know that not I'm not saying he wasn't didn't do a good thing back in the day he did there's no question about it and all credit to him but he's been using this stuff for partisan purposes you want to hear the press going full-bore on this you have to listen to this from the New York Times but before we do I have to say goodbye to Facebook and to YouTube come and listen to the rest on The Daily wire calm because Nobel prize-winning cultural commentator will be here Michael Knowles will be here to talk about the aspect of Martin Luther King that the left doesn't want you to know about
