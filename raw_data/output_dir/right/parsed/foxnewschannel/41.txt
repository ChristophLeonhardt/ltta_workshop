OPTIMISTIC.
SHANNON.
>> Shannon: WILLIAM, THAT’S
VERY INTERESTING.
THANK YOU.
CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION IS BEEN A MAJOR
FOCAL POINT OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION’S AGENDA.
THIS YEAR, U.S. BORDER PATROL
APPREHENSIONS ARE SHARPLY.
LET’S TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF TEXAS,
DAN PATRICK.
I UNDERSTAND HE STARTED
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT
IN TEXAS YESTERDAY AND TONIGHT
YOU’VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH
HIM.
WHAT CAN YOU SHARE WITH US
PUBLICLY?
>> WELL, HE WAS HERE FOR THE
GREAT RALLY WE HAD LAST NIGHT,
FABULOUS.
BEFORE THAT HE MET WITH SEVERAL
TEXAS LEADERS, MYSELF INCLUDED,
TO TALK ABOUT THE CARAVAN AND
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.
WE TALKED TWO HOURS AGO, WE HAD
A GOOD CONVERSATION AND IT’S
CLEAR THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE
COMING HERE DON’T UNDERSTAND
THIS PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS.
THEY’RE NOT GETTING INTO THIS
COUNTRY AND FOR THOSE WHO DO
CROSS ILLEGALLY, THEY’RE GOING
TO BE TURNED AROUND AND SENT
BACK.
HE IS BRINGING THE MIGHT OF THE
MILITARY.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MY BELIEF
LARGER AND EXPANDED DETENTION
CENTERS, EXPEDITED COURTS,
OFFICERS AND MAGISTRATES,
EVERYONE COMING TO THE BORDER.
FOR ANYONE WHO GETS ACROSS,
THEY’RE GOING TO BE TURNED
AROUND.
THEY’RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE
PROCESS OF THE PUT ON AN
AIRPLANE AND SENT BACK.
THESE PEOPLE, FIRST OF ALL,
SHANNON, THESE WOULDN’T BE
HAPPENING IF IT WEREN’T FOR
CHARLES SCHUMER WALKING FUNDING
FOR THE WALL.
THE WALL WILL STOP PEOPLE FROM
COMING.
MEXICO HAS TO COOPERATE.
THEY HAVE TO STOP ALL TRAINS
COMING TO THE COUNTRY.
SECONDLY I SHARED WITH THE
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT, SHUT DOWN
THE BORDER CROSSINGS.
WE HAVE 19 WITH MEXICO JUST OUT
OF TEXAS.
MOST PEOPLE COME ACROSS THE
BORDER CROSSINGS.
UNDER THE TRUMP CASE HE WON THIS
YEAR IN THE SUPREME COURT UNDER
CERTAIN CONDITIONS, HE HAS THE
RIGHT TO DENY ANY ALIEN COMING
INTO THIS COUNTRY.
HE CAN SHUTDOWN THE BORDERS
TOTALLY OR HE CAN SHUT DOWN FROM
ANYONE CROSSING.
THE BORDER, WE CAN PROCESS THEM.
THEN IF SOME ARE FUNNELED ACROSS
THE BORDER, WE CAN PROCESS THEM.
IT MAY TAKE 100 A DAY.
MAY TAKE MONTHS TO PROCESS THEM.
THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE
WAITING TO BE PROCESSED.
WHEN THEY COME ACROSS, THEY WILL
MEET OR JUDGE, BE PROSECUTED,
TURNED AROUND, SENT BACK.
THIS WILL NOT STAND UNDER THIS
PRESIDENT.
>> Shannon: WE KNOW BORDER
PATROL PUT OUT NEW NUMBERS TODAY
AND THE APPREHENSIONS WERE UP
100,000 BETWEEN FISCAL YEAR 2017
AND 2018.
WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE IS THERE
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK,
FALLING APART.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO CRITICALLY
SAY HOW CAN YOU LOOK AT THESE
PEOPLE WHO SEEM SO DESPERATE AND
SIMPLY SAY YOU CAN’T COME HERE.
>> THERE’S TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.
WE HAVE DESPERATE PEOPLE IN OUR
OWN COUNTRY WE NEED TO BE SURE
WE TAKE CARE OF.
WHEN I WAS WITHIN THE LAST TIME
WITH THEM I SAID WE CANNOT
EDUCATE, MEDICAID, OR
INCARCERATE THE WHOLE WORLD.
THERE ARE MILLIONS WHO WOULD
COME IN.
WE WOULD NOT HAVE A COUNTRY TO
HELP ANYONE.
I FEEL FOR THOSE PEOPLE.
THE PRESIDENT FEELS FOR THOSE
PEOPLE BUT YOU CAN’T HAVE THESE
MOBS CROSSING THE BORDER.
EITHER DEMOCRAT OPERATIVES IN
THIS COUNTRY ARE WORKING WITH
HIS CARAVAN OR THE DRUG CARTELS
OR BOTH.
NO ONE CROSSES THE BORDER,
SHANNON, UNLESS YOU PAY A BOUNTY
TO THE CARTELS.
THEY WOULDN’T LET THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE CROSS.
HE WOULD BE BAD FOR BUSINESS.
THE CARTELS, SOMEONE IS PAYING
THEM TO ALLOW THESE PEOPLE TO
COME HERE.
SOMEONE IS FEEDING THEM, SOMEONE
IS PROVIDING BATHROOM FACILITIES
SOMEONE IS FEEDING THEM, SOMEONE
IS PROVIDING BATHROOM FACILITIES
FOR THEM.
SOMEONE IS GUIDING THEM.
I FEEL SORRY FOR THESE PEOPLE,
AS DOES THE PRESIDENT.
THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING LIED TO.
THEY ARE BEING MISLED NEED TO
GET THE MESSAGE.
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING FOX IN
MEXICO TONIGHT, TRANSLATED
SPANISH TO THESE PEOPLE.
GO BACK HOME.
THIS COUNTRY.
THIS IS NOT THE WAY THEY COME TO
YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED
TO STAY.
YOU’RE NOT GOING TO GET IN.
THIS PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS.
HE HAS DRAWN A LINE IN THE SAND.
WE HAVE DONE IT IN TEXAS.
WE ARE DOING EVERY THING WE CAN
TO HELP HIM.
HE’S BEEN RIGHT ON THIS ISSUE
SINCE HE BEGAN CAMPAIGNING.
I JUST SAW POLLS RECENTLY,
SHANNON, THAT THE OVERWHELMING
MAJORITY OF TEXAS AND AMERICANS
ARE WITH HIM.
REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS AND
DEMOCRATS.
WE CANNOT LET OUR BORDERS BE
OVERRULED BY PEOPLE COMING HERE
ILLEGALLY.
IT MUST STOP.
THIS PRESIDENT IS GOING TO STOP
IT.
THEY NEED TO GET THE MESSAGE IF
THEY CROSS, THEY’RE GOING TO BE
SENT BACK RIGHT AWAY AFTER
THEY’VE BEEN PROCESSED TO THE
COURTS THROUGH EXPEDITED COURSES
ON MASS AVENUE OR LIQUID NEVER
SEEN BEFORE FROM THIS PRESIDENT
OR ANY PRESIDENT.
>> Shannon: THE BACKLOG OF
PEOPLE TRYING TO COME HERE
ILLEGALLY AND THE ASYLUM CASES
NEVER THINK OF IT’S GOING TO
TAKE SOME GUMPTION ON
CAPITOL HILL FOR PEOPLE TO CLEAN
OUT THOSE LOOPHOLES AND GET SOME
CAPITOL HILL FOR PEOPLE TO CLEAN
OUT THOSE LOOPHOLES AND GET SOME
OF THOSE THINGS DONE SO PEOPLE
ARE TELLING PEOPLE HE CAN COME
HERE ILLEGALLY, WE HAVE TO FIND
A WAY TO MAKE IT MORE WORKABLE.
>> CAPITOL HILL NEEDS TO
