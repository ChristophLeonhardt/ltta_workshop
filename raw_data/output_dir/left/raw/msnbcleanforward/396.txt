119
00:03:29,112 --> 00:03:31,746
A CAMPAIGN OF RAISING INTEREST RATES, JAY POWELL SAID WE’RE

120
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,415
RATES, JAY POWELL SAID WE’RE STILL NOT AT A NEUTRAL POSITION.

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,450
STILL NOT AT A NEUTRAL POSITION. MONETARY POLICY IS EASY.

122
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:37,686

MONTHLY AVERAGE UNDER TRUMP THAN IT WAS AT THE END OF OBAMA

133
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:01,176
IT WAS AT THE END OF OBAMA BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT’S A

134
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:02,511

AND AT POINT IT ENDS AND WHERE THE SKILL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

138
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:11,120
THE SKILL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE COMES IN OVER HOW EXACTLY THEY

00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,176
WHEN YOU CAN GO TO A BANK FOR 2% OR 2.5% AND IT GOES UP LIKE

PAIRING DOWN THE INVESTMENTS OR A REACTION TO A QUICK INCREASE

161
