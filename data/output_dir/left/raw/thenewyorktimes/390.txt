00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,630
A draft report by scientists
from 13 federal agencies

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,280
obtained by The New York Times

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,340
directly contradicts claims
by the Trump administration

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,220
that human contribution to
climate change is uncertain

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,950
and that the ability to
predict the effects is limited.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,740
"People have called me a climate
skeptic or a climate denier.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,159
I don't even know what it
means to deny the climate.

9
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:22,200
I would say that there
are climate exaggerators."

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,960
Scott Pruitt, administrator of
the Environmental Protection

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
Agency, one of the 13 agencies
that must approve the document,

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,500
has frequently questioned
the extent of human impact

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,647
on climate change.

14
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:34,980
"The climate is changing, and
human activity contributes

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,720
to that change in some measure.

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,390
The real issue is, how
much we contribute to that

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,980
and measuring that
with precision."

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,710
The report states,
"Many lines of evidence

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,020
demonstrate that human
activity, especially

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,040
emissions of greenhouse
gas, heat-trapping gases,

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,520
are primarily responsible

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,740
for recent observed
climate change."

23
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,160
"Global warming is occurring,
that human activity contributes

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,210
to it in some manner.

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,030
But it still begs the question,
‘What do we do about it?’

26
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,319
Does it pose an existential
threat, as some say?"

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,050
The authors of the
draft report write,

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,840
"It is very likely that the
accelerated rate of Arctic

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,510
warming will have a significant
consequence for the United

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,200
States."

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,100
"Measuring with precision
human activity on the climate

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,600
is something very
challenging to do.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,058
And there's tremendous
disagreement

34
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:21,300
about the degree of impact."

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,180
According to the report,
"it is extremely likely

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,310
that more than half of the
global mean temperature

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,770
increase since 1951 was caused
by human influence on climate."

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,080
Scientists are calling
this a test case.

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,050
This is the first major
federal climate science

40
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,900
report to come out in
the Trump administration.

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,240
And how the administration
reacts to it

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,400
could set the tone on climate
change for years to come.

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:00:00,000
