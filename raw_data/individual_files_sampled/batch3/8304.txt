Martha: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY COMING TO THE METROPOLITAN THEATRE IN MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA. NOW WE HAVE A LIGHTNING ROUND. THESE ARE GOING TO BE 32ND ANSWERS IN THE FIRST ONE IS FOR CONGRESSMAN JENKINS. AFTER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU LAID OUT THE EVIDENCE ABOUT IRAN LYING ABOUT THE NUCLEAR DEAL, IF YOU HAD THE DECISION OF A U.S. SENATOR, WOULD YOU VOTE TO END THAT DEALER DO YOU THINK IT’S WISER TO CONTINUE IT? PLAYING ROCKY TOP FOR TENNESSEE AND WEST VIRGINIA. IT’S COUNTRY ROADS HERE, FOLKS. NOT ROCKY TOP. Martha: DULY NOTED. DULY NOTED. WE ARE PROUD WEST VIRGINIANS. WE GET PUT DOWN SO MANY TIMES, PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF US, SO THAT’S WHAT MY CANDIDACY, WHAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN ABOUT. STANDING UP FOR WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE. SORRY TO JUMP IN. IT’S ABOUT WEST VIRGINIA. IT’S WEST VIRGINIA BRIDE. Martha: WHAT ABOUT IRAN? THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WAS A DISASTER. THE IDEA THAT WE CUT PALLETS OF CASH BEING SHIPPED TO IRAN. BARACK OBAMA MADE A DISASTER IS DEAL. WE’VE GOT A DEADLINE COMING UP. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD END THE IRAN DEAL. Martha: EVEN THOUGH THE LEADERSHIP IN IRAN HAS SAID THAT THEY WOULD INSTANTLY RESTART THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM IF THE DEAL WERE ENDED, YOU ARE OKAY WITH THAT? I RESPECT THE STATE OF ISRAEL. I HAVE BEEN WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IN JERUSALEM. I UNDERSTAND THE FORCES OF EVIL THAT ARE ALL AROUND JERUSALEM. THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. WHICH SUPPORT THEM, WE DEFEND THEM.

Bret: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TALKED ABOUT GETTING U.S. TROOPS OUT OF SYRIA. HE ALSO, AFTER MEETING WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR HAVING THEM STAY FOR SOME TIME. WHAT’S THE RIGHT CHOICE? I DON’T THINK ANYBODY UP YOUR NOSE WITH THE RIGHT CHOICES. I DON’T AGREE WITH GOING AROUND THE WORLD AND PUTTING OURSELVES IN HARM’S WAY WHEN ENEMIES ARE FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER. BUT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THERE IS 19,000 OF THEM, OR SOMEBODY TOLD ME. I NEVER MET ONE. I PRODUCED MORE ENERGY THAN ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS AREA SO IT DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE. I WOULD BE FOR CUTTING THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO ABOUT 200 PEOPLE AND GETTING RID OF ABOUT 18,800. Bret: NUMBER ONE THREAT FACING THE U.S.? I THINK WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS VERY ADROITLY HANDLED ISIS AND I THINK WHAT’S GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST REMAINS A POWDER KEG. BUT NORTH KOREA, I STILL AM VERY DISTRUSTFUL OF WHAT’S GOING ON BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA. I COMMEND THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HIS TOUGH TALK HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN THIS TO A PLACE, PERHAPS, UNDER THIS PRESIDENT WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A REPEAT OF THE
