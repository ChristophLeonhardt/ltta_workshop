1
00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:03,550
ASIAN COMMUNITIES THINK THIS IS

2
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:04,017
DISCRIMINATION.

3
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:06,653
>> JUDGE, WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS

4
00:00:06,654 --> 00:00:06,954
CASE?

5
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,823
>> A CASE THAT SUPREME QUARTZ

6
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:12,060
DOES NOT WANT.

7
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:15,462
THE GUIDELINES THAT WERE SENT

8
00:00:15,463 --> 00:00:17,598
DOWN WERE A LITTLE AMBIGUOUS.

9
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:19,566
MAYBE THE UNIVERSITIES IN THE

10
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,567
COUNTRY DO NEED SOME FIRM

11
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:21,001
GUIDELINES.

12
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:22,703
IT'LL BE A COUPLE OF YEARS

13
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:24,371
BEFORE IT GETS TO THAT.

14
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:25,572
>> AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WAS

15
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:27,975
SUPPOSED TO CREATE SOME MORE

16
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:28,675
DIVERSITY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

17
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,811
SO NOW IT'S LIKE, WELL, ALL

18
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:31,578
THESE ASIAN STUDENTS ARE DOING

19
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,346
SO WELL THAT THEY ARE TAKING UP

20
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:34,581
TOO MUCH SPACE?

21
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:38,385
BACK OFF WHILE WE MAKE ROOM --

22
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,987
>> THE MATH DEMONSTRATES THAT IF

23
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:41,855
YOU TAKE A SEAT AWAY FROM A

24
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:43,357
QUALIFIED PERSON BECAUSE OF

25
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:44,591
THEIR RACE IN ORDER TO GIVE IT

26
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:45,559
TO SOMEONE ELSE, THERE IS A

27
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,394
WINNER AND THERE IS A LOSER.

28
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,997
IF THE LOSER IS ACTUALLY MORE

29
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:51,732
ACADEMICALLY QUALIFIED THAN THE

30
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:52,966
WINTER, HOW ARE THEY GOING TO

31
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:53,400
TESTIFY THAT?

32
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,136
THE COURTS HAVE SAID THAT RACE

33
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:56,904
MAY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS

34
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,573
LONG AS IT IS ONE OF MANY

35
00:00:59,574 --> 00:00:59,907
FACTORS.

36
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:01,642
IT CANNOT BE THE POSITIVE FACTOR

37
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:04,778
AND IT CANNOT BE THE FACTOR THEY

38
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:05,712
WEIGHED THE HEAVIEST, BUT THEY

39
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,814
MAY TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT.

40
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:09,483
THE ONE WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION

41
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:10,284
OF IT BEING A PRIVATE

42
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:11,051
INSTITUTION AND WHY DO THEY HAVE

43
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:13,253
TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN AND

44
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:13,287
TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANW

00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:13,320

00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:14,121

00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:14,554
TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANW

59
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,856
THEY TAKEN A LOT OF LEGACY

60
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:22,329
STUDENTS, THEY TAKE ATHLETES.

61
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,331
>> THE INTERNAL RESEARCH SHOWS

62
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:25,732
THAT IF YOU ARE A FACULTY

63
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:26,833
MEMBER, THE OFFSPRING OF A

64
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:30,270
FACULTY MEMBER, YOU HAVE 50% --

65
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,339
>> Martha: 50%!

66
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,274
THE ADMISSION RATE IS, LIKE,

67
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:34,574
NINE?

68
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:39,012
>> AND IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN

69
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:41,315
A ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDENT CLOSE

70
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:43,951
TO 25% ACCEPTANCE.

71
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:46,353
>> TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THE

72
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:47,654
SUPREME COURT CASES THAT WE ARE

73
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:48,522
TALKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF

74
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:52,526
TEXAS WHICH IS OWNED BY THE

75
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:53,260
STATE IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT

76
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:53,727
CANNOT APPLY --

77
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,764
>> THIS IS DIFFERENT.

78
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:59,633
>> IN 2017 ALONE, RECEIVED OVER

79
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:01,668
600 MILLION IN FEDERAL DOLLARS.

80
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:02,936
>> THEY DON'T NEED ANY MONEY

81
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,938
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT!

82
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,341
>> THEY GOT 600 MILLION FROM THE

83
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:07,641
FEDS.

84
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:08,575
WHEN THEY ACCEPTED THAT

85
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:10,577
600 MILLION, THEY AGREED THEY

86
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:11,912
WOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE

87
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:14,014
BASIS OF RACE AS ONE OF MANY

88
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:14,414
CONDITIONS.

89
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:15,182
>> Martha: IF THEY TURNED ON

90
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:16,583
THE MONEY IN THE FUTURE, THEY

91
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:17,584
WOULD HAVE LESS OF AN ARGUMENT.

92
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:18,652
THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT.

93
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:20,387
>> CORRECT.

94
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:21,121
CAN YOU SEE THEM TURNING DOWN

95
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,889
THAT KIND OF MONEY?

96
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,590
>> Martha: THEY HAVE SO MUCH

97
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:26,560
MONEY, JUDGE.

98
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,161
DO YOU THINK THAT RACE SHOULD BE

99
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,563
COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE

100
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:30,931
EQUATION SO THAT NOBODY CHECKS

101
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:32,566
ANY BOXES AND THEY ONLY LOOK AT

102
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,301
YOUR NUMBERS AND QUALIFICATIONS?

103
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:35,168
>> I WOULD AGREE.

104
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:38,605
I THINK FROM THE ASIAN-AMERICAN

105
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,673
CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE, IT SHOULD

106
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:40,173
BE A MERITOCRACY.

107
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:43,543
IT SHOULD BE BASED ON YOUR

108
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:47,581
SCORES, YOUR EXTRA CURRICULAR --

109
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:50,384
NOTHING LIKE A PERSONALITY.

110
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:51,118
COURAGE, BRAVERY?

111
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,786
ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS LIKE

112
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:53,086
THAT?

113
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:53,954
IT'S INSULTING.

114
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:56,156
>> IT'S INSULTING TO ASCRIBE TO

115
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,557
EVERYONE THE ATTRIBUTES OF ONE

116
00:02:57,558 --> 00:02:58,625
OR TWO JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE IN

117
00:02:58,626 --> 00:00:00,000
THE SAME GROUP.
