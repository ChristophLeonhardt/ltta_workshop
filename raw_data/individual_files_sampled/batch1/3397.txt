my name is Pete Souza I was the chief official White House photographer for President Obama and my new book Obama and intimate portrait just came out president would often visit Walter Reed Hospital where wounded soldiers were taken after being injured in Iraq or Afghanistan or really anywhere in the world in 2010 we walked into a room and met with Army Ranger Cory Remsburg who was severely injured in Afghanistan he had dozens of stitches across his side of his head and was not fully cognizant when we walked into the room there was a picture hanging on the wall that I had taken eight months earlier of President Obama meeting Cory Remsburg in Normandy I had forgotten at that moment and to see the contrast of this photograph that was hanging on his hospital room wall and the injured Cory in the bed was almost too much to bear we didn't know that he was going to recover a year a year and a half later we were in Phoenix for a speech and Cory met with the president backstage was learning how to walk again and was able to walk across this small room using his walker and not long thereafter that he was invited to be the guest of honor at the State of the Union speech and sat next to Michelle Obama in her box a year after that we visited Cory again in Arizona some veterans had built him a house and we visited his house and suburban Phoenix and I think there was one other time towards the end of the administration he came and visited President Obama in the Oval Office and walked through the door by himself to shake hands with the president
