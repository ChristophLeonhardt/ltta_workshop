1
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,360
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things if I remember this</font>

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,100
era correctly you gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it away for free</font>

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,130
online and this became sort of a meme

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,350
for the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's still now this</font>

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,839
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing this is the way it's done</font>

6
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,429
software before that had basically been

7
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,890
sold so forth Netscape gave it away for

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,470
free later so was that because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,418
coming out of a university or did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

10
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,190
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the way to distribute it</font>

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,900
so there were two reasons one is right

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,100
the whole project<font color="#CCCCCC"> was funded by the</font>

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,719
National Science Foundation and so part

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,160
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did when you ran us have fun</font>

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,480
to do is you basically released it as

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,829
what today would be called open source

17
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,750
or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of free software was</font>

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,629
no model to take that charge for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

19
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,190
other thing though was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

20
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,019
itself you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of came out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

21
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,820
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of free or open-source kind of</font>

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,010
culture and remember the internet was

23
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,109
created even going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the 60s but</font>

24
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,550
then certainly through the 70s 80s and

25
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">90s the internet was an alternative</font>

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">network to what all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,730
were doing so Microsoft for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the</font>

28
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,840
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mosaic project</font>

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft had still had this you know</font>

30
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,440
land manager and all these proprietary

31
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,940
networking standards Lotus had their own

32
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,770
networking approach novell was selling a

33
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,050
lot of net where Apple had appletalk

34
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,380
deck had met and so networking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

35
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,080
era in most companies was closed to

36
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,490
proprietary and so there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this huge</font>

37
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,870
problem of ever actually hooking

38
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,310
companies up to ever talk to each other

39
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,310
or ever have consumers hooked up because

40
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,210
everything was proprietary in fact on

41
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the consumer side a while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Protestant</font>

42
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">compuserve were the main services and</font>

43
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,130
they were proprietary so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

44
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,770
was always contrarian against the

45
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,720
internet was a reaction to all that all

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,220
those proprietary efforts and so the

47
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet was always defined by open</font>

48
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,580
protocols that anybody can implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

49
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,050
open software that anybody could

50
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,820
download and use and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the huge</font>

51
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,710
advantage of that is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going for</font>

52
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be universal</font>

53
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,090
then free is the way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right and</font>

54
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is where I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get really</font>

55
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,390
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confused it's not free</font>

56
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,380
just because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

57
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,790
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it's not free just because you</font>

58
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to charge for it or</font>

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,970
whatever you use free is a technique

60
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,230
when you want to get universal<font color="#CCCCCC"> coverage</font>

61
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,480
and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are just a lot</font>

62
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,280
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable and everybody uses them we</font>

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,690
never SAT there and said boy there's a

64
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,949
great company owns a company we could

65
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,120
build here and if only we could charge

66
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go start like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

67
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,659
never came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up but we did think in terms</font>

68
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:16,400
of you know let's make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> free let's</font>

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,260
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> super easy to use like a huge</font>

70
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">focus was ease of you</font>

71
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,600
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it really easy to download</font>

72
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,520
let's provide a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> help I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

73
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend a lot of time doing technical</font>

74
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,040
support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the first you know 12</font>

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,770
months and the theory very much was

76
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,360
basically you're building a network or

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically building a network of people</font>

78
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,300
using web browsers and a network there

79
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,470
for people who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run web</font>

80
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,170
servers the other side of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> too to get</font>

81
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,420
the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> yin and so we knew that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

82
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,980
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the free was definitely the way</font>

83
00:02:39,980 --> 00:00:00,000
to do that
