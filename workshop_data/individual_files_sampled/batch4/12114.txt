on Sunday night moonlight shocked America by defeating heavily favored best picture competitor Lala Lin and won for one simple reason those in Hollywood decided that intersectionality should defeat Hollywood self aggrandizement this year here's the thing about moonlight it's not a very good movie it's interesting in the way that all character studies are kind of interesting it's a look at a place and at a time and at a person but it doesn't truly uplift or soar or actually do much of anything it won because the Academy voters preferred not to hear another year of griping about hashtag oscarssowhite and because those same voters could feel good about supposedly slapping Donald Trump in the face with diversity it's no coincidence that an Oscars ceremony that open with Kimmel tweeting president tweaking president Trump remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars was racist ends it with the Academy giving the Best Picture Oscar to brokeback inner-city Miami this isn't to say there can't be a great movie made about a black gay coming-of-age story there can but this wasn't it this isn't the first time the Academy has bowed to political correctness rather than quality of course and this year's Oscar battle featured two battling Hollywood priorities honoring itself and honoring the most politically correct picture of the year in recent years this battle has become pretty much the entirety of the Best Picture race in 2014 Hollywood rewarded its own importance with birdman instead of the far superior whiplash or American sniper in 2013 Hollywood rewarded the rather forgettable 12 years of slave instead of gravity or Dallas buyers club in 2012 Hollywood gave an Oscar to Argo yay Hollywood does foreign policy instead of zero dark thirty or Lincoln in 2005 Hollywood had its biggest PC off in a Best Picture fight between Brokeback Mountain crash and Munich Capote was actually a better picture than all of those three one of the reasons Hollywood no longer rakes in the big bucks other than on tentpole features is that it sees only the profound movies as those that Center on intersectional concerns upholding the virtue of identity politics or the importance of art itself rather than movies that tell people stories that they want to see lala land is a far better more watchable movie than moonlight but there were at least three other movies that were better than either this year hell or high-water arrival and hacksaw ridge and all three were nominated that doesn't include what I thought was the most entertaining flick of the year 10 Cloverfield Lane unfortunately for those pictures they weren't concerned with black gay children or the wonders of Hollywood if somebody ever makes a movie about a half black half Native American bisexual transgender trying to make his or her way in Hollywood you can hand them the Oscar right now and this is how you know Hollywood is dying instead of telling particular stories with general appeal how it would tell stories that appeal only to themselves they reassure themselves with their importance every single year either by making movies telling them how important they are or by making movies trying to show how important they are by taking on the issue of the day in after-school special fashion it doesn't make for good entertainment which is why TV wrap which actually tells stories rather than getting up hung up on the self-important nonsense of the movie industry now outranks the movie industry in terms of quality I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so we'll talk everything oscar's in just a minute we will also be talking about the Democrats picking a new leader and what you need to know about Tom Perez that new leader but first we have to say thank you

prepare with been calm is the place to go online to get your my Patriot supply four weeks supply of emergency food okay so we can jump right into the Oscars so the big winner at the Oscars last night was not moonlight the big winner at the Oscars last night was Donald Trump that was the big winner at the Oscars last night because Donald Trump basically could sit there and watch Hollywood make a mockery of itself Sally cone one of my favorite people on the left of MSNBC and CNN fan you remember her hands up don't shoot Sally cone tweeted out right before the Oscars that she hoped every single speech was political which I tweeted so do so does have a Republican in the country we all want every speech to be political because the more political these speeches are the better off Republicans are because watching all of these all of these sort of comforted rich limousine liberal socialists ripping on America is really something that off puts a lot of voters and people react to that by voting for people on the Republican side of the aisle Hollywood has never driven people into the arms of the Democrats except through kind of their subtle cultural moments but they don't drive people into the arms of the Democrats by just shouting about how terrible Republicans are this is something that Hollywood gets wrong this stuff that Hollywood is good at creating story creating character that stuff can help convince people that Democrats are right but it doesn't convince people Democrats are right when marlon brando sends up sheen Littlefeather at the oscars in 1973 a Native American spokeswoman to pick up his award and rant and rave about how America's means the Native Americans nobody voted Democrat because of that and nobody voted Democrat in 2003 because Michael Moore got up at the Oscars and talks about the fictional president george w bush getting us into a fictional war hollywood people think that we want to hear what they have to say we don't we want to hear the stories they have to tell but we don't actually want to hear the things they have to say because the things they have to say are generally stupid they don't know anything about politics so why in the world would we listen to them when it comes to politics but again hollywood doesn't know that so instead what Hollywood does is they think that we're watching because we want to hear their opinions on politics so Jimmy Kimmel just couldn't help himself he opened up with a bunch of jokes about Trump here were just a few of them and it was joke after joke about Donald Trump and how terrible Trump was and look how wonderful we are and we love Meryl Streep and Meryl Streep it's the best because she made fun of Donald Trump that one time and some ceremony and yeah we love her and sure she was in a really crappy movie Florence Foster Jenkins that nobody ever saw but it doesn't matter because Meryl Streep guys Meryl Streep so yeah he does all of these jokes in a row about Donald Trump and we're all supposed to sit there and be like yeah this is great yeah the real reaction is can you guys get over yourselves please we'll really this is the best that you can do these are your best jokes about Donald Trump calling him racist and calling presumably the people who voted for him racist and it's a great way to alienate an audience that's already not watching any of your Best Picture nominees nothing that was nominated for Best Picture this year did well at the box office I think the only exception as far as a movie that did well at the box office was arrival I'm not aware of any other movie that was nominated for Best Picture this year and that did over a hundred million business did arrival end up doing a hundred million in business if it did it was real close so it was it was it was not it was not you know a blockbuster blow out of the ballpark here's a good movie I enjoyed it but all of the movies that are nominated this year again were seen by pretty much the people in this particular room and then it didn't stop there the self-aggrandizement of Hollywood is just unending Viola Davis won Best Supporting Actress for her role in Suicide Squad no no no sorry was no not for Suicide Squad it was it was for her role in know what was the name of that movie fences fences sorry sorry I got that wrong but Viola Davis who was I thought she was fantastic in Suicide Squad that's why I thought that she had to win so was that guy who like shot fire from his fingers never anyway Viola Davis she gets up and she gives this speech we're the only profession the only one that celebrates what it means to live a life sounds complaining before this before the show started today that I'm kind of tired you know the reason I'm kind of tired today because my wife has woken up the last several mornings at four o'clock in the morning to go into the hospital because she is a she is a doctor and she's in her residency which means she's getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning to help people who in some cases are terminally ill clearly the only profession that cares about living a life that honors and celebrates living a life is Hollywood and it's so just yeah when Viola Davis says stuff like this the fact is the vast majority of people in the United States work jobs where they're helping each other live better lives but the artists have to pat themselves on the back and is where I was saying at the very beginning the artists in Hollywood have to make themselves feel important one of two ways because otherwise they're just reading lines for living and wearing funny costumes so they have to make themselves feel important one of two ways one is they make important stories right we're gonna make a story about a black gay ute living in Miami right that's gonna be the thing that makes us important or alternatively we have to talk about how important we are to everybody else now I don't get on the air every morning and talk about how important my job is right I don't because you see they're important to you or it's not important to you but I don't have to preach how important what I do is to you because you'll decide for yourself and I think that's true for the vast majority people when you call a plumber he doesn't show up to your house and go you know what it's really important I fix your toilet today I'm the guy who stands between you and crap running over your floor right the plumber doesn't do that it just goes and he fixes your stuff but the artist community because they understand that people sort of see them as frivolous they feel the necessity to go out and talk about how special they are all the time and this not under estimating art I love art I love the movies I love books I love plays I drew I love the arts I grew up in the arts my dad was somebody in the arms my mom is somebody in the arts my sister is somebody in the two of my sisters are people in the arts I love the Arts they're fantastic you know I write novels I love the arts but you know art is wonderful it's enriching it can connect us to each other but the ever arrogance the true arrogance of saying the only profession that celebrate what it means to live a life I mean that's really astounding you know who else celebrates like literally everyone does you know who else celebrates what it means to live a life morticians right they actually put together the funeral arrangements where we remember people there's also something that's really it's really high-handed about saying that only the lives we choose to honor in Hollywood are the important ones when she said in this speech she said there's one place all the people with the greatest potential are gathered the graveyard people ask me all the time what kind of stories do you want to tell Viola and I say exhume those bodies exhume those stories the stories of the people who dream big and never saw those dreams to fruition and this kind of stuff goes over big in Hollywood oh the dreams the dreams oh yeah but the reality is the vast majority of people in the graveyard their stories will never be told but they are still remembered by their family their impact is still felt your life doesn't end when your life ends unless Viola Davis assumes you and makes a story about you you know with it that's not even real right unless you a fictional story about a person who never existed know what actually makes your life important is the friends and family around you in the way you impact the world in a better way and the way that you do honorable things for friends and neighbors and make the world a better place that's how you make the world a better place there are a lot of people who are remembered who are really evil that doesn't make them more important it doesn't make them more special you know being remembered by people who actually matter is I think more important than Viola Davis remembering you and the idea that Hollywood is what confers value on people is really kind of gross I mean another element of this and some people like this some people hated it I didn't like it was Jimmy Kimmel did this routine where he ushered in a bunch of people off the Hollywood tour bus directly into the Oscars and here's what it looked like see the whole point of this little shakier is to demonstrate just how special Hollywood is it's so special that you can bring people in off the street and then you can show them just how magical Hollywood I mean look at all these important people and look at all these narrow do well rubes you know just walking out what an honor for them what an honor for them we brought in the peasantry off the street and now the peasants get to hobnob with polloi they get to be among the stars see what would have been great honestly and what had been funnier is if Kimmel had before this taken a bunch of the stars to visit people on their actual jobs right had taken like you know the they make movies about these actual jobs would have been really funny to take Chris Pine for example in hell or high water and take him to an oil derrick and like show him the people working in oil derrick right or be really funny to take nicole kidman and take her down to the local plumbers Union and have her see what people are actually doing over there because that would have said okay look we're Hollywood and we know what we do is kind of frivolous and it brings meaning to some people but we also understand that what you do is really important instead this whole event is all about how Hollywood is SuperDuper important to all of our lives and look it's fun I enjoy the Oscars as much as the next guy although I admit I did not watch a lot of it live last night but at the same time this sort of this sort of I'm going to look down on you because we're from Hollywood more special it manifests itself not just in terms of general attitude toward the toward the people who live in the middle of the country they're a bunch of rednecks and rubes it also manifests itself in terms of politics so we're going to talk more about that in just a second but for that you have to go over to Daily wire calm right now and subscribe you go for daily
