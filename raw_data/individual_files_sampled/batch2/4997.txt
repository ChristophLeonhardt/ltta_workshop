right well if you were watching this channel or anything on television news over the weekend you know all about the March for our lives you had thousands of people turning out in Washington DC other cities around the country in response to that massacre that tragedy at that Florida school a few weeks ago and of course it did raise a question though seas of people you saw on your screens or if you are out there yourself that you saw in person who were they what brought them there what does it mean for the future of American politics really well guess what a political scientist was on the scene there in Washington DC someone who is studying the resistance movement to President Donald Trump and decided to do a study to try to do a demographic profile of the folks who turned out in Washington DC it's very interesting what she found it tells us what maybe wasn't happening that we thought might be happening and what really was happening in what it means for the future let me show you what I mean by that first of all check this out this was not necessarily at least according to this research not necessarily a big bipartisan event basically almost 8 out of 10 people who were at this one in DC they identified themselves as left-leaning almost 9 out of 10 voted for Hillary Clinton so really you're not going across the political spectrum there we really are talking about Democrats Democratic leaning voters what else did we learn about them though well also there were plenty of young folks there there were you know 10 percent who were under the age of 18 we talked a lot about students who are getting politically active as a result of that shooting but look the average age it was significantly older than that 49 years old was the average age of the folks who were turning out so maybe a little older than we thought maybe on one side of the political spectrum a little bit more or a lot more than the other side how about this 70 percent of them were women 7 out of 10 more than 2 out of 3 were women at that March in Washington according to this study also a very educated group 72% almost 3 and 4 had at least a bachelor's degree and then there's this this one surprised me the most 27% had never protested before that means 73% had this is a group of folks who weren't just by and large turning out for the first time as folks who've turned out before put it all together what you're seeing here maybe is the face of democratic party activism in the Trump era democratic party activism that was at the Women's March before that's been at some of these other protests it's very educated it's female much more than it is male and again it's about middle age when you average it all together is that the future of democratic party activism are we starting to see that take shape what would that mean for the future of the Democratic Party what would that mean for the future of American politics I'm going to walk and hopefully not break my nose the step-by I managed to land oh look at that gonna talk about this with our panel here let me bring them in Laura Bassett political reporter for The Huffington Post Kari Sheffield is the founder of bold media national editor for accuracy in media and Christina Greer is an associate professor of political science at Fordham University and NYU's Mick silver Institute fellow um Christina I'll start with you when you see that demographic profile what do you make of that well I just want to remind everyone that you know we have had lots of protests in the past 15 months but keep in mind there are lots of Americans who were protesting well before the election of Donald Trump and they were greeted with the same sort of response from the media they were actually greeted by tanks and military eyes police officers from the US federal government so we have to remember that this is also an extension of protest movements that have actually been seeding the ground for quite some time I do think that there is a partisan element obviously there are a lot of Democrats who feel incredibly frustrated by the shenanigans and sort of wholly incompetent nature of the Donald Trump presidency right now but hopefully this will maintain itself not just in November for the midterms but all the primaries that are coming up in a lot of these states especially for Democrats honestly who some have been asleep at the wheel and I think that's a real wake-up call for a lot of elected officials who see that Democrats are galvanized and motivated that's my message in particular is within a Democratic primary if that's the sort of mobilizing force now Kerry from the from the other standpoint though if from a conservative standpoint you're looking at masses of people turning out for not just this the women's March a lot of other events you're looking at that sort of demographic political profile we're seeing there what do you make of that sure well I think it would be foolish for Republicans to not see the level of energy and the level of enthusiasm Pennsylvania 18 special election showed that the enthusiasm for the liberal evening candidate that being said I think Democrats would be smart too if they want to win and and I don't want them to however they need to look at Pennsylvania 18 and say this sort this sort of playbook in terms of the candidate who ran there he was much more centrist than these marchers these marchers are not representative of where the center of the country is they're not representative you know in terms of this this grassroots March as you said it was not grassroots high school students it 10% were under 18 whereas the Census Bureau says 23 percent of the country is under 18 so this was clearly not reflective of the actual demographic arc of the country so I think that Republicans you know they need to be serious about making sure that they are targeting who you know in their district they're shoring up their base they're making sure that the energy is being focused on bringing people to the middle honestly I think that a lot of people are upset about how polarized their country are going to do or the country is and so if the if the progressive base is going to nominate a bunch of left-leaning incredibly leftist people they're gonna lose Laura the thing that's interesting to try to reduce this to the the basic election terms is when we look at the trouble Republicans may be and we'll see what happens but maybe in heading into November a lot of the discussion ends up coming back to women with college degrees suburban women in this massive gender gap that we've always talked about a gender gap but we're looking at a bigger gender gap than we've seen in the past at least right now and when you look at the folks who are out there that's what I'm seeing in those statistics absolutely and I think that women have always leaned a little bit Democratic while the majority of men have leaned Republican but I think this year we're seeing it's a very specific moment because what happened in the election in the 2016 election was that we came so close to having the first female president and whatever you think about Hillary Clinton that was which huge mine milestone for women's rights and instead we got this president who bragged on tape about having grabbed women by the you-know-what and has hired people who feel the same way about women hired people who have been domestic abusers and again he's been accused of sexual assault by more than twelve people and so I think women sort of were awakened by that moment we woke up and we're seeing that in the in the women's marches the 20 17 and 18 which was almost equally as powerful and the March last weekend women are leading distance and twice as many women are running this year as did in 2016 and so I think Republicans do have something to fear and I and I think it's women hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want
