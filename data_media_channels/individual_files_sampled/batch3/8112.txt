New at Walmart and Walmart.com â™ª PETE: WELL, A HISTORIC MOVE IN IRELAND AS THE COUNTRY VOTED TO REPEAL A LAW BANNING ABORTION. SOME IN THE U.S. MEDIA MARKING THIS AS A VICTORY. LISTEN. IN IRELAND, A ALLOW AND EMPHATIC "YES" AS VOTERS REPEAL A CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON ABORTION A CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON ABORTION. THE FINAL TALLY SHOWING OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THE MOSTLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY. THIS VOTE MARKS A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN WHAT WAS ONCE DESCRIBED AS THE MOST CATHOLIC COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. PETE: SO, DOES THIS MOVE MOVE THE CATHOLIC FAITH MORE TO THE LEFT AS RELIGION BECOMES MORE PROGRESSIVE TO WELCOME MORE PEOPLE IN? IS THAT A GOOD THING OR SHOULD WE STICK TO THE ORIGINAL TENETS? THAT IS THE CORE QUESTION HERE, SHOULD RELIGION STAY CONSERVATIVE TO THE CORE TENETS OR FOLLOW THE PROGRESSIVE TRENDS OR FOLLOW THE PROGRESSIVE TRENDS-of-SOCIETY? LET'S BRING IN OUR RELIGIOUS PANEL TO DISCUSS. DR. MENEZAFRIDI IS A MUSLIM SCHOLARLY, DR. RAZZ IS THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE, RABBI COOPER IS AN ASSOCIATE DEAN IS HE SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER, AND FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS IS A FOX NEWS RELIGION CONTRIBUTOR. A GREAT PANEL. I COULD START IT OUT THIS WAY. A MUSLIM SCHOLAR, EVANGELICAL PASTOR, AND CATHOLIC PIECE ENTER A JAR. BUT I WON'T. IT WOULD BE THE START OF A GREAT JOKE. NO LAUGHING MATTER, A SERIOUS SUBJECT. FATHER JOHN, I WANT TO START WITH YOU. IRELAND, A PREDOMINANTLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY, WHAT IS THIS VOTE SAYING ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH? WE SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CACHE STOOD UP AGAINST THE REPEAL OF THIS AMENDMENT, SO IT WASN'T THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS SAID NO, THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO IN. BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY OR THE PERSUASIVENESS SUFFICIENT IN ORDER TO SAY "NO" TO THIS REPEAL OF THIS AMENDMENT TO THIS REPEAL OF THIS AMENDMENT. AND SO IT SAYS THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, SOCIETY HAS MOVED IN THIS DIRECTION SO STRONGLY OF PRO-ABORTION, YOU CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT, YOU COULD SAY NO, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST ALLOWING FREE CHOICE, BUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ALONE SINCE WE'VE HAD UPWARDS OF 40 MILLION ABORTIONS. 40 MILLION? THAT IS A HUGE NUMBER, AND THE FACT THAT IRELAND, A CATHOLIC COUNTRY, A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY IS GOING IN THAT DIRECTION IS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE NOTHING TO CELEBRATE. PETE: ABRAHAM, YOU CALL IT A PROTEST VOTE. WHY? WELL, I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN IRELAND IS AN EMBRACE OF THE, YOU KNOW, EU ENVIRONMENT. IRELAND'S DONE VERY WELL BY TAKING A LEAD IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND, YOU KNOW, AS AN ORTHODOX RABBI IT'S NOT FOR ME TO COMMENT ON WHICH A THE CHURCH SHOULD DO, BUT CLEARLY THAT SOCIETY THAT HAS MADE A MOVE AND NOW YOU HAVE A CHURCH WHERE IT'S STILL A PREDOMINANT FAITH, THERE'S PREDOMINANT TEACHERS, BUT THERE HAS TO BE A SHIFT IN TERMS OF PERSUASION RATHER THAN THE STARTING POINT, WELL, THESE ARE THE RULES, YOU FOLLOW THEM, YOU KNOW, OUR WAY OR OUT THE DOOR. IT IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT. PETE: SAMUEL, PIVOTAL MOMENT OVERALL AS WELL, FROM AN EVANGELICAL PERSPECTIVE, IS PROGRESSIVISM CREEPING INTO OUR FAITH? AND IF SO, WHAT IMPACT IS THAT HAVING ON NOT JUST IRELAND, BUT AMERICA AND THE WORLD AT LARGE? WELL, THE IDEA OF PROGRESSIVE CHRISTIANITY IS OXYMORONIC IN ITS DEPICTION AND ITS EXPRESSION ITS DEPICTION AND ITS EXPRESSION. YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH PROGRESSIVE CHRISTIANITY. LET ME EXPLAIN. CHRISTIANITY IS ABOUT THE GOSPEL THE GO TO SLEEP OF JESUS NEVER CHANGES. IT'S TRUTH, LOVE, GRACE, HOPE, AND FAITH, REGARDLESS OF THE TIME, THE CULTURE, SOCIETY. TRUTH, LOVE, GRACE, AND HOPE SHOULD NEVER BE SACRIFICED ON THE ALTAR OF POLITICAL, CULTURAL OR SEXUAL EXPEDIENCY OR SEXUAL EXPEDIENCY. PETE: ABSOLUTELY. MENAZ, BRIEFLY ON THIS, WHAT DOES ISLAM HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ABORTION AND LIFE AS IT PERTAINS NOT JUST TO IRELAND BUT THE WHOLE ISSUE? WELL, ISLAM, LIKE ALL THE OTHER ABRAHAMIC FAITHS, BELIEVES THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE. HOWEVER, IT'S ALSO A VERY PRACTICAL RELIGION WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN LEGAL SCHOLARS THAT HAVE SAID THAT IF THERE IS A DANGER OF MOTHER'S HEALTH OR THERE IS SOME KIND OF DISEASE, THAT IT IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER A CERTAIN KIND OF LEGAL SITUATION. IT'S NOT THAT MUSLIMS DON'T ARE PROMOTING ABORTION AT ALL, BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LOOPHOLES IN THE ISLAMIC LAW, AND THERE ARE CERTAIN FATWA LAW, AND THERE ARE CERTAIN FATWAS WHICH IS JUST A LEGAL OPINION FROM SCHOLARS THAT DO ALLOW IT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S A VERY MULTILAYERED ISSUE. I'M THE ONLY WOMAN HERE ON THE PANEL SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY COMPLEX FOR ALL WOMEN, WHETHER THEY ARE PRO-ABORTION OR AGAINST ABORTION. PETE: OF COURSE. I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE TERM " I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE TERM "PRO-ABORTION." I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS PRO- I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS PRO-ABORTION. I THINK WE'RE ALL PRO-LIFE AND IT'S ABOUT HOW WE SEE LIFE IS IMPORTANT TO US IN OUR FAITH IMPORTANT TO US IN OUR FAITH. PETE: ONE MORE TOPIC, TRY TO GET YOU ALL TO CHIME IN ON IT BRIEFLY. IS THE U.S. PLUMMETING BIRTHRIGHT A SIGN THAT A FOCUS ON FAMILY VALUES ARE DIMINISHING ON FAMILY VALUES ARE DIMINISHING? THE NEW STATS FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS SHOWS THAT LESS BABIES ARE BEING BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REPLACEMENT RATE IS GENERALLY TWO KIDS PER FAMILY, BUT YOU SEE THOSE NUMBERS, THE NUMBER OF BABIES BORN PER YEAR IS DROPPING. FATHER JOHN, LET ME START WITH YOU. THE STEREOTYPE OF COURSE IS THAT CATHOLIC FAMILIES HAVE LOTS OF KIDS. IF THAT IS CHANGING, WOULD THAT BE A SIGN THAT THE VIEW OF FAMILIES IS CHANGING FOR CATHOLICS AS WELL? I THINK SO. I MEAN, I THINK THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION HAS AFFECTED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN A PROFOUND WAY, SAYING SEX HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PROCREATION. AND IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT PROCREATION. IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE UNITIV ACTION, BUT THERE'S ALSO VERY PRACTICAL POLITICAL THINGS THAT ARE CHANGING IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE ARE GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE WITH $200,000 OF DEBT, AND ARE THEY GOING TO GET MARRIED TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS $200,000 OF DEBT AND START OFF A FAMILY THAT'S $400,000 OF DEBT AND HAVE CHILDREN? IT'S NOT EASY. THAT'S WHY POLITICS MATTER. ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE FAMILY LIFE FAMILY LIFE. PETE: ABRAHAM, FOR EACH OF YOU WITHIN I WANT TO GET YOU ALL IN, I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME YET. WHAT IS ABOUT BIRTHRATE THAT MATTERS IN DEMOGRAPHICS? TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TWO ALLIES JAPAN AND ISRAEL. JAPAN'S VERY AFFLUENT. THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GO FROM 130 MILLION TO 80 MILLION PEOPLE. THEY'RE NOT BRINGING CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD. I THINK THEY'VE LOST THEIR VALUES. ISRAEL, YOU YOU GUYS COVER THEM EVERY DAY, IT'S UNDER THE GUN, EXISTENTIAL THREATS. THE BIRTHRATE AMONG RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR PEOPLE IS GOING UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SENSE OF THEIR PAST AND FUTURE. AS FAR AS AMERICA, IT'S CALLED THE iPHONE. THIS IS THE ME GENERATION. MY SUGGESTION IS SHUT THE DAMN THING OFF AND GO BACK TO BASIC VALUES VALUES. PETE: SAMUEL, WHY DO KIDS MATTER PETE: SAMUEL, WHY DO KIDS MATTER? KIDS MATTER. IT'S A DE FACTO OUTCOME OF A CONSTANT MOCKERY OF THE INSTITUTION OF THE FAMILY. WE SEE THAT CULTURALLY IN FILMS AND MOVIE AND CONTENT, IN WRITINGS, PUBLICATIONS, SOCIAL MEDIA. THE FAMILY NOW IS A JOKE, AND EVEN THE IDEA OF A MODERN FAMILY A TRADITIONAL FAMILY FOR WHATEVER HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE IT IS A JOKE. SO IT'S UNDER ASSAULT, KIDS MATTER, IT'S THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, THE FUTURE OF MORALITY AND SPIRITUALITY, THE FUTURE OF OUR HUMAN EXISTENCE INDEED OUR HUMAN EXISTENCE INDEED. PETE: MENAZ, YOU SPECULATE THAT THE ECONOMY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH BIRTHRATES AS WELL. ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT STATISTICS AND IF YOU LOOK AT DATA, WOMEN ARE HAVING KIDS LATER, WOMEN HAVE TROUBLE HAVING KIDS LATER BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A PROFESSIONAL LIFE. THEY HAVE TO BOTH BE WORKING, A MAN AND WOMAN OR ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE TO BOTH HAVE INCOMES. I THINK THE ECONOMIC FACTOR IN THE UNITED STATES MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND LOWER MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES TO HAVE A WHOLE REALISTIC ECONOMIC PLAN. AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING MARRIED LATER, EVEN IN THE MUSLIM-AMERICAN COMMUNITY I SEE THIS AS A BIG IMPACT SEE THIS AS A BIG IMPACT. PETE: IT'S AN AMAZING CULTURAL CONVERSATION BECAUSE IN THE WEST FAMILIES ARE HAVING LESS KIDS, BUT A LOT OF THE REFUGEE OR IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS MOVING INTO THOSE COUNTRIES ARE HAVING MORE KIDS, WHICH CHANGES THE WHOLE RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, AND SOCIAL DYNAMIC IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IT TRULY MATTERS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU GUYS BACK, I HAVE A FEELING, ON
