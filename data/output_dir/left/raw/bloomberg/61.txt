1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,160
Intelligent.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,610
Indestructible.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,700
And with no humans on board,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,420
these sail boats are plotting

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,133
their own course through the
waters of San Francisco Bay.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,400
If this guy gets his way,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,380
soon there will be hundreds of them

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,541
trawling the ocean for data.

9
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,458
(electronic music)

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,320
This is Richard Jenkins.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,403
And he's someone who likes a challenge.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,610
Here he is trying to
break the world record

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,920
for land sailing in 2009.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,560
I registered at 116 miles an hour,

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,340
which I thought was kind of a low bar

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,060
and I could do it in maybe a year

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,490
and it was actually anything but easy.

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,490
Instead of one year, it took Jenkins

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,030
a decade of toiling in
deserts around the world.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,890
But break the record he did,

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,349
clocking just over 126 miles per hour

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,573
in his own custom designed vehicle.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,490
The next challenge was a nod to Magellan

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,214
with a modern twist.

25
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:14,427
It encouraged me that
nothing has ever gone

26
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,910
around the world unmanned
and it's kind of the last

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,780
great records to get.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,670
So Jenkins set out to
build a robotic sailboat

29
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,750
capable of circumnavigating the globe.

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,370
In 2013, he sent the world's
first unmanned vessel

31
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,400
across an ocean, going from
San Francisco to Hawaii.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,890
We actually called it the Honey Badger

33
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,950
because, you know, it doesn't give a shit,

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,720
it just plows through anything.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,830
And somewhere, amidst all that,

36
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,023
he found the time to start a new business.

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,600
Based in this former aircraft
hangar, in Alameda, California

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,620
Jenkin's company Saildrone
has already raised

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,203
90 million dollars from investors.

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,770
And here's what's got those
venture capitalists so excited.

41
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,220
A 20 strong fleet of
autonomous sea-worthy drones.

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,916
Who put the shark faces on them?

43
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,516
That was me, last weekend,
I just freehanded that.

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,280
Powered only by the wind and sun,

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,810
these GPS guided bots can survive

46
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,623
at sea for months at a time.

47
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,500
Bristling with sensors,
scientific equipment,

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,470
and cameras, they beam back real time data

49
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,930
and images via satellite
from the ocean surface.

50
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,310
These two vehicles are
on their way back from

51
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,380
a seven, almost eight month voyage.

52
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,970
Probably 10 thousand miles.

53
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,890
Where did they go?

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,340
Down to the Equatorial Pacific,

55
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,280
studying El Nino affects on the equator.

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,410
Right.

57
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,480
You wanna know what it looks like?

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,791
Is this the camera view?

59
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,653
Yes, this is a real time camera view.

60
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:48,561
And there it is, that's a picture from

61
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:50,084
Equatorial Pacific right now.

62
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:51,153
It's nice and sunny.

63
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,183
It's always sunny.

64
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:53,633
It's always sunny down there.

65
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,760
Right now, Saildrone is busy

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
prepping for a new mission.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,010
The 2000 mile round trip
to an area of Pacific Ocean

68
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,093
known as the white shark cafe.

69
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,490
Great White's come to this
remote spot to hang out

70
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,761
for months at a time and
scientists have spent decades

71
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,030
wanting to know why.

72
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,310
So we're working with Stanford University

73
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,200
to take these vehicles and
literally follow the sharks

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,210
to the cafe to understand, literally,

75
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,043
what they're doing there.

76
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:28,880
Is it food, is it reproduction?

77
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,490
No one really knows.

78
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,670
The drones are ideal
for missions like this.

79
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,370
They're much cheaper
than large research ships

80
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,230
and can collect many
different types of data.

81
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,140
PH, chlorophyll, humidity, radiation,

82
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,950
wind speed, direction, temperature,

83
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,783
the list goes on.

84
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:47,080
We measure everything you
could possibly measure

85
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,580
near the surface of the ocean.

86
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:52,590
And data like this sheds light

87
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,340
on something that affects everyone.

88
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,873
The weather.

89
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,210
There really is infinite use for

90
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,480
more accurate weather and climate data.

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,618
So a big focus for us this
year is deploying drones

92
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:10,990
into the hurricane field so
we can find out how strong

93
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,080
they're going to be and
where they're going to land.

94
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,450
And the impacts of that
information is huge.

95
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,180
So for insurance risk, financial markets,

96
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,180
and for people's safety.

97
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,810
On an unmanned craft,
hurricane force winds

98
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,713
would shred a conventional sail.

99
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,843
So instead, the drones harness
the wind using the hard

100
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:34,623
vertical wing adapted from
Jenkins' land sailing days.

101
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,440
When wind passes over an
airplane wing, it produces lift.

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,424
In this case, the wind
produces thrust that moves

103
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,053
the sail drone forward.

104
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,080
Jenkins invented a tail,
with a small adjustable tab

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,890
to control this force.

106
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,184
It stops the wing from
spinning out of control

107
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:55,880
and lets the robot make
snap sailing decisions.

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,340
Everything about the craft is 100 percent

109
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,553
salt-water proof and submersible.

110
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,070
Today I'm hitching a
ride to see Rich deploy

111
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,793
two of his drones to the white shark cafe.

112
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,510
There's not much wind
so they're given a tow

113
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,930
into San Francisco Bay
before being released.

114
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,512
There's enough wind here
now we can start sailing.

115
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:22,910
We just left the city and this is where

116
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,810
we normally let them go.

117
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,643
Goodbye drone.

118
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,673
As soon as their released,
they're on full autonomous mode.

119
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,010
You guys have gone 200
thousand nautical miles

120
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,360
without an incident?

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,770
Yep, we've had the drones
operating for four years now.

122
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,840
And not a single scratch on the vehicle.

123
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,993
And nobody's every phoned
it in as a, like a UFO

124
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:45,510
or some sailor's like what
the hell are these things

125
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,343
doing out in the water?

126
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,722
No, they behave really predictably

127
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,910
and safely around ships.

128
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,480
And there are animals that
come up and check them out?

129
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,313
Yep.

130
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,146
We got some really good pictures.

131
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,490
So, there's a spotted fur
seal, jumped on for a ride

132
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,272
up in the Chukchi sea
about 65 degrees north,

133
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,503
and hung out there for about six hours.

134
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:08,372
(electronic bubbly music)

135
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,130
These drones have a two
week journey ahead of them

136
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,416
before they make their shark rendezvous

137
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,730
and soon, they'll be part
of an even bigger fleet.

138
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,220
I want to get a thousand drones

139
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,257
within three to four years.

140
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,610
And that gives us full global coverage

141
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,630
so we have as much or
better data of oceans

142
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,780
that we currently have for land

143
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,897
and that will transform our
understanding of our planet.

144
00:06:37,986 --> 00:00:00,000
(electronic fading out)
