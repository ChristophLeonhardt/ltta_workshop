1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,400
For sixty years, Crimea, a strategically important
peninsula in the Black Sea, has been a part of Ukraine.

2
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,520
After the Pro-European Revolution
toppled President Yanukovich in February,

3
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,620
the majority ethnic Russian population, with the
help of Russian soldiers, took control of the region.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,380
An illegal referendum on whether to
join Russia or not was held shortly after,

5
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,260
and the next day, Russia annexed the peninsula
in a move widely condemned by the international

6
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,020
community.

7
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,020
On May the 9th, Russia and Ukraine celebrate Victory Day, which commemorates

8
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,180
the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War 2.

9
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,980
This year with Russia President, Valdimir Putin making an appearance

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,480
and Russia power and pageantry on shown,

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,300
the parade in Sevastopol acted as transparent in symbolic show of force.

12
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,040
That new reality for some means that having to hide their identity when talking about their

13
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,580
opposition to Russia's annexation of Crimea.

14
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,380
With a number of Pro-Ukrainians having been beaten, kidnapped and even been killed,

15
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,820
the fear of speaking openly is very real.

16
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,440
With Crimea now coming under Russian control,

17
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,540
people who wishes to remain have to apply for Russian passport

18
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,500
but the infamous Russian bureaucracy is not making it easy.

19
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,800
With a bleak economic future, the outlook for Crimea's youth,

20
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,100
is far from certain.

21
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,100
While there was protest and support for the revolution in Crimea, Pro-Ukranian activists who oppose

22
00:09:57,100 --> 00:00:00,000
Russia's annexation have been violently targeted by the new Crimea authority.
