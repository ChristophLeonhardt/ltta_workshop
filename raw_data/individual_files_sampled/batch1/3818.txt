hi I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson I'm an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History and I'm host of star talk radio welcome back to star talk radio and it's fighting all these air molecules like what's up with that we win my favorite part I thought it was really poignant when she teared up recognizing her mortality and enough tear collected in the eye so that one of the drops floated off of her face I thought that was a heavy hammer there but they did some actual experiments with tears on the space station and the surface tension of the liquid actually will more likely have it stay connected to your cheek surface tension is what will allow a drop of water to come down here and not just fall off it'll sort of come horizontally a little bit maybe even to your chin the water is clinging to a surface that's surface tension it overrides gravity at those levels so we saw the tear we got it but I thought that that was poignant the a great scene with the fire extinguisher ways to propel yourself in space how terrifying it was that the broken particles of the satellites coming at such speed that's scary stuff by the way the total satellite destruction scenario it's real one satellite can take out ten they each take out another 10 go from one to ten two hundred to a thousand in a matter of days you could maybe a month total satellite destruction if you'd go around smashing satellites don't do it oh another thing by the way Sandra Bullock randomly comes out of orbit and she lands in a pond and just swims to shore excuse me most places on earth you'll land you are near no Shore at all you're gonna drop in the middle of the Pacific or in the Arctic and you'll be eaten by sharks in the ocean or polar bear will eat you argue something bad is gonna happen to you you're not gonna just crawl out and sit on land and say boy I had it I had a long day you know I got in big trouble when I send out some tweets about gravity I just thought people would be interested to know what they didn't get right in fact I didn't even say they got it wrong I just said these were mysteries of the movie why is it that Sandra Bullock a medical doctor is repairing the Hubble Space Telescope excuse me we don't send medical doctors to repair the Hubble Space Telescope any more than we're gonna send a mechanical engineer to do open-heart surgery on you please okay so I tweeted that and they might have had a little emotional flavor to it but still what I didn't tweet were the hundred things that got right I celebrate the movie for its effort to get so much right it's unfortunate that my initial salvo of tweets were interpreted as me somehow not liking the movie I enjoyed the movie immensely
