so through the post today I've got some
cards that I ordered on play calm and a
booster packs for this ps3 game and
they're small just like that I ordered
seven of them and one deck which is one
of these which a bit thicker but it
didn't send them or in one packet they
sold it in individual packets look at
that what a load of what up look at
this what a waste just for these little
things play all of them could have fit
in one exactly mr. I'm gonna do that now
you hold back can you hook up why this
play com watch yeah it's not rocket
science look in done that's about a
whole square kilometer of trees you save
their play.com that's more on over thank
you
