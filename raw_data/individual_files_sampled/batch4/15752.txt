this is the border wall and the border walls system between Bethlehem and Israel people ask why is it so wide it's 45 centimeters wide but Palestine has been taking potshots at Israel and Israeli soldiers forever and this prevents that people say why is it so tall it's 9 meters tall and on top of that you've also got the wire fencing well the gentleman that designed it who came up with it recognized that at 6 meters people can still climb it and can still survive the jump off at 9 meters nobody tries to climb it and then people say why is it so ugly it's very hard to please the Liberals right it's so ugly because it has a purpose on the other side of this wall on the Palestinian side there's graffiti against Israel against the IDF against all of the people trying to keep the peace here and actually the gentleman that built it said you know what that's ok will allow graffiti on the wall that they call ugly because that's their democratic right to express themselves and just behind us just behind this border wall is a facility for enabling people to come across at a sophisticated checkpoint where they can be checked correctly this to me is the model that America needs on its southern border I think Trump's people would do well to come to Israel and replicate the success that Israel's had with its border war for more updates from the border war between Israel and Bethlehem join the rebel team at rebel Israel calm
