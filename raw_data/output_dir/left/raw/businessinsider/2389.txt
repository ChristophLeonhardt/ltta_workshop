dan frommer today the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question</font>

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,920
comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Karate Kid he or she wants to</font>

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">know why should i buy an apple tablet if</font>

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I already have an iphone and a cheap</font>

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,970
laptop that's an excellent question of

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,230
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you who've been</font>

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,239
living under a rock the apple tablet is

11
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,430
supposedly what we've been calling a big

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,350
ipod touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's supposed to come out</font>

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,739
sometime next year you know the frank

14
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,660
answer is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably won't a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">people most people probably won't buy an</font>

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,829
apple tablet<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's going to</font>

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">be something that's going to sell nearly</font>

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,399
as fast as the ipod<font color="#CCCCCC"> touch or the iphone</font>

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,110
simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of its price it's</font>

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,450
probably going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive 700 800</font>

21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,059
900 bucks however<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it will sell</font>

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a group of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,379
includes people who take long flights

24
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,300
and or short flights and don't

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,890
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have their laptop</font>

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,780
out the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> time people who thought</font>

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,340
about buying a kindle who<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font>

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,380
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read but don't necessarily</font>

29
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,759
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be locked down with something</font>

30
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that only does one thing well the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kindle</font>

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,050
of course has that e-ink screen that's

32
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,789
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for reading novels but if</font>

33
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,590
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and that's cool if that's</font>

34
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,610
the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you want to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font>

35
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to sometimes play games</font>

36
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,479
and read the web and do other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff the</font>

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,369
kindle is not ideal for that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

38
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:30,440
there's a there's a niche for now people

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,090
who might buy the apple tablet somewhere

40
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,709
the intersection<font color="#CCCCCC"> between people who are</font>

41
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,720
buying netbooks who have a little more

42
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,420
money they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would spend on on a more</font>

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,340
expensive netbook if there were one on

44
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> market and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

45
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,970
buying ipod touches and stuff like that

46
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,950
the apple fanatics you know will

47
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,289
probably buy maybe you know up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

48
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,240
million of anything that Apple comes out

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,670
with so even if that rate it's not going

50
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,920
to be a big revenue generator for Apple

51
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,380
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> compared to the iphone but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

52
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,280
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're</font>

53
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,840
pushing it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,610
right now it'll probably out solve some

55
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,979
macs and probably will you know be

56
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,660
outsold by a lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things Apple</font>

57
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,700
makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple more questions about the</font>

58
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,989
tablet real quick what do you think the

59
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,340
battery life will be like and how

60
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,739
durable will it be battery life you know

61
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,510
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to last too</font>

62
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,970
long but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apples made some big</font>

63
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,040
advances in battery technology recently

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,540
if you look at their laptops they're all

65
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,189
self-contained now they last a lot

66
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,069
longer than the

67
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">too I think the goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would probably be</font>

68
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:27,349
four to five hours like a cross-country

69
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,700
plane ride without having to charge it

70
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,010
how durable it be this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

71
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,629
you've seen a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of pictures online at</font>

72
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:35,609
people's iphone screens being cracked

73
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a much larger screen will</font>

74
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,829
probably also be glass so they have to

75
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,450
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's durable or they have to</font>

76
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,769
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got a case for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

77
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,060
something because that's the last thing

78
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,189
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in your in your bag</font>

79
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:50,069
and have it shatter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next question</font>

80
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,139
this comes from Alaska Miller our own

81
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,819
Alaska Miller what's the most exciting

82
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">startup in new york</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> city this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> winter who</font>

83
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,379
has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most interesting business model</font>

84
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,359
you know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of cool startups</font>

85
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,889
here right now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the one that</font>

86
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,209
kind of answers both of those questions

87
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">very well is foursquare which recently</font>

88
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,650
closed a round of funding from<font color="#CCCCCC"> O'Reilly</font>

89
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,949
tech ventures and union square ventures

90
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:12,449
Foursquare if you don't know is kind of

91
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,650
the convergence of mobile social

92
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,260
networking location base and basically

93
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,849
what it does is lets you see where your

94
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,010
friends are which bar there at where

95
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,379
they're shopping etc it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also lets you</font>

96
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,209
pop out your foursquare app wherever you

97
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,530
are and see what your friends like

98
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,150
nearby where they've been checking in

99
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">lately and things like that and that</font>

100
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,540
provides an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting business model</font>

101
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,669
you know mobile ad networks and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

102
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,049
everyone has been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

103
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,759
how to make location a part of the

104
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,549
advertising equation because it can lead

105
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,259
to higher ad rates and better targeting

106
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,239
and things like that this is a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

107
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,549
think that has a good product an

108
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:50,459
interested user base and is big in key

109
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,889
places like New York where location can

110
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:54,659
really make a big difference this is

111
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Facebook has stayed away</font>

112
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">from and Twitter until recently has kind</font>

113
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,540
of stayed away from location<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so they</font>

114
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">might get some competition from those</font>

115
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,470
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> big guys but so far Foursquare has</font>

116
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,699
really good buzzin and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

117
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,189
potentially interesting business model

118
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,979
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> question from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Peter AKA sling</font>

119
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,919
is the domain which ends in dot mobi

120
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,079
worth buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the mobile websites</font>

121
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,779
using it or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a waste of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money at</font>

122
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,849
this point for almost every company I

123
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,800
think dot mobi is a waste of money it

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,330
was introduced about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four years</font>

125
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,180
ago as a way to quickly go on your cell

126
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">phone to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a mobile website for</font>

127
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,740
you know any company like Google was one

128
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,540
of the first companies that put their

129
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,770
name behind it they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would use</font>

130
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google dot mobi two things have happened</font>

131
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,760
since then first of all people realize

132
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not very easy to use the web</font>

133
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,970
on a phone that doesn't have a accordi

134
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,620
keyboard or a virtual keyboard anyway

135
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,120
and those people still aren't using the

136
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,670
web on their phone much so the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

137
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,110
shortcut or something like that doesn't

138
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">really make sense really on the server</font>

139
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,830
side is where that's going if a web

140
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,240
server sees you're coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cell</font>

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
phone and there's a mobile version of

142
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that site available that's generally the</font>

143
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,520
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been working so far you know if</font>

144
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,250
you go to google com on your cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

145
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,750
you know at least on an older phone it's

146
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,040
not going to take you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

148
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,680
happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meantime is that phones</font>

149
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,330
have gotten much better browsers if you

150
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,210
look at the iphone and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even new</font>
