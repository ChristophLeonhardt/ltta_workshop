INFORMATION RELATED TO MOLLIE'S
DISAPPEARANCE.
THE FIRST IS 1-800-452-1111 OR
515-223-1400.
THERE IS ALSO A DEDICATED E-MAIL
TO ACCEPT TIPS.
I WANT TO JUST TELL THE PEOPLE,
IF YOU HAVE A TIP FROM OUTSIDE
THE AREA, IF IT IS OUTSIDE OF
BROOKLYN, IOWA, CALL YOUR LOCAL
AUTHORITIES, REPORTING A TIP YOU
SEE OUTSIDE OF THE AREA WOULD
TAKE TIME FOR US TO RESPOND TO
THAT.
IF YOU'RE FROM OUT OF STATE OR
OUT OF THE GENERAL AREA, CALL
YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
THEY'VE BEEN GREAT AT FOLLOWING
UP ON THE TIPS TO SPEED THINGS
UP, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE I
WANT TO THANK.
CENTRAL IOWA CRIMESTOPPERS FOR
STAFFING THE TIP LINES.
THEY'VE BEEN GETTING HUNDREDS OF
TIPS EVERY DAY AND WORKING VERY
HARD ON IT.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR
WORKING WITH THE FAMILY ON THE
REWARD PUT OUT FOR MOLLIE.
THERE IS ONE OTHER GROUP OF
PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO THANK AND
THAT IS FROM MY OFFICE.
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY
CO-WORKERS FOR WORKING HARD ON
THIS, ESPECIALLY OUR
DISPATCHERS.
THEY'RE BEING INUNDATED WITH
TELEPHONE CALLS AND ALL KINDS OF
THINGS AN TWO OF THEM LIVE IN
BROOKLYN SO IT IS VERY NEAR AND
CLOSE TO THEIR HEARTS WHAT IS
HAPPENING HERE.
THEY'VE BEEN GETTING BEAT UP
OVER THIS AND I WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT THEY KNOW HOW MUCH WE
APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU, SHERIFF.
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE STARTED BY
INTRODUCING MYSELF.
I'M KEVIN WINKER.
I'M THE DIRECTOR OF
INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS FOR THE
DEPARTMENT OF IOWA PUBLIC
SAFETY.
THE INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSE HAS
NOT SLOWED DOWN.
INVESTIGATORS FROM THE COUNTY
SHERIFF'S OFFICE, THE DCI AND
FBI CONTINUE TO COMPLETE LEADS
THAT CAME IN AS WELL AS EVALUATE
AND PRIVATIZE NEW LEADS BEING
RECEIVED EVERY DAY.
WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND MOLLIE.
NOT DUE TO A LACK OF EFFORT OR
LACK OF RESOURCES.
WE APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED
SUPPORT OF MOLLIE'S FAMILY, THE
COMMUNITY AND MEDIA
ORGANIZATIONS KEEPING THE STORY
IN THE NEWS.
WITH APPRECIATE EVERYONE SHOWIN
UP TODAY FOR THE PRESS
CONFERENCE, OUR POSITION HAS NOT
CHANGED ON THE RELEASE OF CASE
FACTS, RESULTS, AND CONCLUSIONS.
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS FRUSTRATING
FOR MANY IN THE PUBLIC AND THE
MEDIA, BUT FEEL THIS IS
NECESSARY FOR OUR INVESTIGATION.
OUR POSITION HAS ALSO NOT
CHANGED IN THAT IF WE EVALUATE A
PIECE OF INFORMATION AND FEEL
THE RELEASE COULD LEAD US TO
MOLLIE, WE WILL DO SO
IMMEDIATELY.
AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THERE,
ARE MEDIA REPORTS REGARDING
DETAILS THAT THE DID FCI HAS NOT
CONFIRMED.
THE FACT THAT WE DON'T CONFIRM
OR DENY THE DETAILS IS NOT AN
INDICATOR OF THE TRUTH OR
FALSITY.
WE HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT SOCIAL
MEDIA POSTINGS AND THE
INVESTIGATION AND WHETHER THEY
ARE BENEFICIAL OR NOT.
THE POSTINGS ARE BENEFICIAL AND
THAT THEY KEEP THE INVESTIGATION
IN THE PUBLIC EYE, HOWEVER, I
WOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THE
POSTINGS ARE OFTEN RUMORED AND
UNCONFIRMED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.
AS A RESULT OF THIS
INVESTIGATION, MANY QUESTIONS
HAVE ARISEN FROM THE PUBLIC AND
THE MEDIA REGARDING MISSING
CHILDREN IN IOWA.
WITH ME TODAY WAS MEDINA, THE
MISSING PERSON CLEARING HOUSE
MANAGER FOR THE DIVISION OF
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.
AT THIS TIME I WOULD ASK HER TO
COME FORWARD TO PROVIDE
INFORMATION RELATED TO MISSING
PERSONS IN IOWA.
>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE, AS
KEVIN HAS MENTIONED, MY NAME IS
MEDINA, I'M THE IOWA MISSING
PERSONS CLEARING HOUSE MANAGER.
WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME
QUESTIONS.
THERE WERE A TOTAL OF 3690
PERSONS ENTERED INTO THE
NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION
CENTER.
OF THOSE 225 WERE LISTED AS
JUVENILES.
A MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE RUN AWAY
SITUATIONS.
26 OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS LISTED
ON THE CLEARING HOUSE WEBSITE
ARE CATEGORIZED AS
INVOLUNTARILY.
THOSE 26 CASES DATE BACK AS FAR
AS 1976 WHICH CONFIRMS THAT
ABDUCTIONS AND INVOLUNTARILY
DISAPPEARANCES ARE NOT COMMON IN
OUR STATE.
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN STEADY OVER
THE YEARS WHEN IT COMES TO
MISSING PERSONS, RUN AWAY YOUTH
AND AMBER ALERTS.
THE CLEARING HOUSE WEBSITE WAS
ESTABLISHED IN 1985 AS A RESULT
OF IOWA LEGISLATION PACED IN
IOWA CODE CHAPTER 694 DESIGNED
TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION TO
KEEP THE PUBLIC INFORMS ON
MISSING IOWIANS.
IOWA IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES
THAT PUBLISHED ALL MISSING
PERSON'S INFORMATION.
LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE AUTHORITY
TO ADDRESS MISSING PERSONS CASES
IN IOWA.
ALL ENTRIES INTO THE NATIONAL
CRIME INFORMATION CENTER AND
INVESTIGATIONS ARE HANDLED BY
LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND
SHERIFF'S OFFICES.
THEY CAN SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM
STATE AND FEDERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS IF NEEDED.
THE CLEARINGHOUSE KEEPS TRACK OF
SIGNIFICANT, LIKELY CRIMINAL
CASES OCCURRING IN OUR
JURISDICTION REGARDLESS OF THE
TIMEFRAME.
PEOPLE GO MISSING FOR VARIOUS
REASONS WHETHER THAT BE BY
CHOICE, WANDERING AWAY BECAUSE
OF THEIR DISABILITY, RUNNING
AWAY FROM HOME, STRANGER
ABDUCTION OR SOMEONE THAT THEY
KNOW.
WE REALLY HOPE THAT THIS
CLARIFIED SOME QUESTIONS THAT
THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC HAS HAD
REGARDING MISSING PERSONS AND A
AT THIS POINT I'LL TAKE ANY
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE
REGARDING MISSING PERSONS IN
IOWA.
>> ALL RIGHT.
WE PLAN TO CONDUCT ANOTHER PRESS
CONFERENCE RIGHT NOW NEXT
TUESDAY.
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PRESS
CONFERENCE WILL BE POSTED ON THE
DPS WEBSITE.
WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION
TO PROVIDE TO YOU NEXT TUESDAY.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I'LL
BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THEM.
>> TED WILLIAMS, IT HAS BEEN
REPORTED THAT A RED SHIRT HAS
BEEN FOUND AND I WAS WONDERING,
CAN YOU SHED ANY LIGHT ON
WHETHER A RED SHIRT HAS BEEN
FOUND AND WHETHER THERE IS ANY
KIND OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE
RED SHIRT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
FOUND AND MOLLIE AND AT THIS
STAGE, DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPECTS?
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION
WITH ME TODAY ON A RED SHIRT
BEING FOUND AND THAT IS NOT TO
SAY THAT THERE WAS ONE FOUND OR
NOT FOUND.
I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT
INFORMATION.
AS FAR AS SUSPECTS GO, WE'RE
STILL, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT
ALL POSSIBILITIES.
I'M NOT IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW
TO SAY WE HAVE SUSPECTS, WE
DON'T HAVE SUSPECTS, PERSONS OF
INTEREST OR ANYTHING ELSE.
>> INITIALLY, IT WAS REPORTED BY
YOUR AGENCY AND OTHERS THAT SHE
WAS WEARING A BLACK SPORTS TOP.
NOW NEWER DESCRIPTION THAT YOU
REFERRED THAT SAID SHE WAS IN A
PINK SPORTS TOP.
THAT MAY BE CONFUSING TO PEOPLE
OR THE PUBLIC.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DISCREPANCY
THERE?
>> NO BUT I CAN LOOK INTO THAT
AND LET YOU KNOW.
>> EVEN ON THE POSTER IT SAYS
BLACK SPORTS TOP.
>> I CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT BUT I'LL
LOOK INTO THAT AND GET BACK TO
YOU IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR
INFORMATION.
>> IS -- A SUSPECT?
>> WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO
SAY WHO IS A SUSPECT, WHO ISN'T
A SUSPECT OR THAT THERE ARE
SUSPECTS.
>> HAVE YOU EMPLOYED DIVERS TO
SEARCH AREA PONDS?
>> WE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING PONDS,
FIELDS AND EVEN FROM THE AIR.
WE'VE BEEN DOING SEARCHES IN
MANY DIFFERENT MANNERS.
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS
FAR AS IF WE'RE USING DIVERS.
MY ASSUMPTION WOULD BE IF WE'RE
SEARCHING PONDS, WE'VE BEEN
USING DIVERS.
>> IS THERE ANY THOUGHT ABOUT
RESTARTING THE SEARCH EFFORTS
WITH VOLUNTEERS.
WOULD THAT DO ANY GOOD TO ASK
FOR THE VOLUNTEERS AGAIN AND
SEARCH NEW AREAS FURTHER AWAY?
>> I LEAVE THAT UP TO THE
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE
WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE FOR THE
INVESTIGATION ON ANY GIVEN DAY.
THEY HAVE THE LATITUDE.
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION
AT THE AVAILABILITY TO MAKE THE
DECISIONS AND WE LEAVE THE
DECISIONS UP TO THE
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM.
>> SINCE YOU RAISED THE REWARD
AMOUNT, HAVE MORE TIPS BEEN
COMING IN?
>> TIPS HAVE BEEN COMING IN
REGULARLY.
THE PACE TO WHICH THEY'RE COMING
IN, I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER IT
INCREASED, DECREASED, STAYED THE
SAME SINCE THE REWARD AMOUNT HAS
BEEN UPPED.
>> HAVE YOU FOUND ANY ARTICLES
OF CLOTHING OR ANY PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE?
>> THAT WILL BE ANOTHER AREA
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DELVE INTO
AT THIS TIME BECAUSE IT WOULD
SPEAK TO THE RESULTS OF AN
INVESTIGATIVE LEAD.
>> CAN I CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE
NO SUSPECTS AND NO PERSONS OF
INTERESTS?
>> NO.
REGARDLESS OF WHAT I JUST SAID
OR YOU INTERPRETED.
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK WHEN DID
WE HAVE SUSPECTS OR PERSONS OF
INTEREST.
>> ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAVE NO
SOLID LEADS AT THIS POINT?
I THINK ALL LEADS ARE VALUABLE.
HOW YOU DEFINE SOLID WOULD BE UP
FOR INTERPRETATION.
WE VIEW ALL LEADS AS VALUABLE.
AS THEY COME IN, THEY'RE
EVALUATED AND PRIORITIZED AND
WE'RE LOOKING INTO EVERYTHING AT
THIS POINT.
>> ARE YOU CLOSER TO SOLVING
THIS NOW THAN TWO WEEKS AGO?
>> THAT WOULD BE A CONCLUSION
BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION AND
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT
AT THIS POINT.
>> I'M SORRY.
REPEAT THAT?
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY IF MOLLIE --
OR WAS SHE ABDUCTED OR
DISAPPEARED?
>> I'M CONFIDENT WE HAVE A SOLID
TIMELINE THAT THEY'RE WORKING
OFF OF.
AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT READY TO
DISCLOSE WHAT THE TIMELINE IS
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT YOUR
QUESTION IS.
>> SINCE THE REWARD WAS
INCREASED, CAN YOU CHARACTERIZE
THE KIND OF TIPS THAT HAVE COME
IN?
HAVE THERE BEEN DIFFERENT TYPES
OF TIPS AS A REWARD OR RECOVERY
FUND HAVE PROMISED ANYTHING?
>> I REALLY DON'T HAVE THE
INFORMATION WITH ME RIGHT NOW TO
SAY IF ANY OF THE LEADS PROVIDED
ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT OR NOT.
LEADS ARE A GOOD THING.
AS TIPS COME IN THEY GENERATE
LEADS.
I WOULD SAY ALL LEADS ARE
IMPORTANT AND THEY'RE ALL BEING
LOOKED AT.
>> IS THERE ANY SIGN OF A
DISTURBANCE INSIDE THE HOME?
ANYTHING OUT OF PLACE?
ANYTHING UNUSUAL AT HOME?
>> AGAIN, THAT IS ANOTHER AREA
THAT WOULD CAUSE ME TO COMMENT
ON THE RESULT OF AN
INVESTIGATIVE LEAD AND I'M NOT
GOING TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME.
>> CAN YOU EXPAND ON THE SEARCH
THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN
SPECIFIC?
>> NO.
AS I'VE MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, AS
LEADS COME IN AND INFORMATION IS
EVALUATED, THE INVESTIGATIVE
TEAM RESPONDS TO THOSE AND
PRIORITIZES THOSE.
I EXPECT THE SEARCHES TO
CONTINUE WHETHER THEY'RE FROM
THE AIR, ON BODIES OF WATER OR
IN FIELDS, WHEREVER THE LEADS
MAY TAKE THEM.
>> ARE YOU TREATING THIS AS A
STRANGER ABDUCTION?
>> WE'RE TREATING THIS AS A
MISSING PERSONS INVESTIGATION
AND ARE TRYING TO FIND MOLLIE.
THAT CONTINUES TO BE OUR FOCUS
IS TO FIND MOLLIE.
>> CAN YOU VERIFY THE IMPORTANCE
OF EVERY PASSING HOUR?
>> IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR
EVERYBODY.
IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR THE
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM, FRUSTRATING
FOR US AND PARTICULARLY
FRUSTRATING FOR THE FAMILY AND
FRIENDS OF MOLLIE.
OBVIOUSLY NOBODY WANTS TO FIND
MOLLIE MORE THAN THESE FOLKS
RIGHT HERE AND WE'RE INCLUDED IN
THAT GROUP.
IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING.
IT HASN'T SLOWED OUR EFFORTS.
WE HAVE NOT SLOWED DOWN AT ALL
THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND SO
WE COME TO WORK EVERY DAY WITH
AN ATTITUDE THAT WE'RE GOING TO
FIND MOLLIE TODAY AND WE HOPE TO
BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND REPORT
THAT TO YOU SOON.
>> CAN YOU CONFIRM THERE WAS
FOUL PLAY?
>> I'M NOT GOING TO CONFIRM
ANYTHING AT THIS POINT RELATED
TO THE RESULTS OF A LEAD OR TRY
TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT
THE INVESTIGATION SHOWS AT THIS
TIME.
>> CAN YOU SAY HOW MANY TIPS
HAVE COME IN?
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER.
IT WOULD BE IN THE HUNDRED.
>> CAN YOU SAY HOW MANY STATE
POLICE OFFICERS ARE WORKING THE
CASE?
>> I WOULD SAY I BELIEVE WE
REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, AND NOT
JUST STATE POLICE OFFICERS, BUT
INVESTIGATORS IN GENERAL, FROM
THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, THE
FBI, THE DIVISION OF CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION, THERE ARE AN
AVERAGE 30 TO 40 WORKING THIS
CASE A DAY.
>> BRIEFLY EXPLAIN HOW RELEASING
THIS INFORMATION MAY COMPROMISE
YOUR INFORMATION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IF
YOU GAVE US MORE, WE COULD HELP
YOU.
HOW COULD THAT POTENTIALLY BACK
FIRE?
>> IT IS PART OF OUR EVALUATION
PROCESS, WE CONSIDER THAT.
THERE ARE PARTS OF ANY
INVESTIGATION THAT WE HOLD VERY
CLOSELY FOR GOOD REASON, SO WE
ARE CONSTANTLY EVALUATING THAT
PROCESS AS WELL AS TO WHAT
INFORMATION WE SHOULD RELEASE
AND WHAT INFORMATION WE
SHOULDN'T.
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T BELIEVE
IT IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO
SO.
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT
APPROACH.
WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS
FRUSTRATING FOR EVERYONE
INVOLVED BUT WE BELIEVE IT GIVES
US THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO
RESOLVE THIS INVESTIGATION.
>> I'M SORRY, I COULDN'T HEAR
YOUR QUESTION.
>> CAN YOU SPEAK ON THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC GIVING
TIPS, WHATEVER TIPS THEY HAVE?
>> IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT
CONTINUES TO LET US GET TO KNOW
MOLLIE.
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO KNOW
MOLLIE OR WHO HAVE SEEN MOLLIE,
TALKED TO MOLLIE IN THE DAYS
LEADING UP TO HER DISAPPEARANCE.
OBVIOUSLY IF PEOPLE HAVE THAT
TYPE OF INFORMATION, THAT WE
HAVEN'T TALKED TO YET, WE WOULD
ENCOURAGE THEM TO CALL US.
YOU KNOW, AS THE SHERIFF SAID,
IF SOMEBODY THINKS THEY'VE SEEN
MOLLIE RIGHT AWAY, THEY NEED TO
CALL 911 OR CALL LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT TO GENERATE AN
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO WHEREVER
THAT LOCATION IS THAT THE
SIGHTING OCCURRED.
INFORMATION LIKE YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT, PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE KNOWN
MOLLIE WHO WANT TO COME FORWARD
AND PROVIDE A PIECE OF
INFORMATION, THEY CAN USE THE
TIP LINE TO DO THAT.
IF THEY BELIEVE THEY KNOW THE
IMMEDIATE WHEREABOUTS, THEY NEED
TO CALL 911 OR THE LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT WHEREVER THEY MAY BE
IN THE COUNTRY.
>> CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT LAW
ENFORCEMENT SEARCHED A PIG FARM
RIGHT AROUND THE VICINITY OF
BROOKLYN, IOWA, AND IF YOU DID,
HAVE YOU HAD TO RETURN TO THE
PIG FARM?
MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS HAVE
YOU ASKED ANY OF THE SUSPECTS IF
YOU CAN RESPOND, TO TAKE A
POLYGRAPH.
>> WE HAVE SEARCHED MANY AREAS
AROUND BROOKLYN, IOWA.
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS
OF THAT AND I'M NOT GOING TO
SPEAK TO WHAT WE HAVE OR HAVE
NOT ASKED ANY PEOPLE TO DO IN
REGARDS TO THIS INVESTIGATION.
>> CAN YOU TALK ABOUT --
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER.
LIKE I SAID, WE'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING UP ON LEADS.
THOSE LEADS ARE IN THE HUNDREDS.
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT ALL
INTERVIEWS, WE'VE CONDUCTED
NUMEROUS INTERVIEWS TO THIS
POINT.
>> WILL WE HEAR FROM MOLLIE'S
MOM OR DAD IN REGARDS TO THIS
PRESS CONFERENCE?
DOES IT MAKE YOU OPTIMISTIC
KNOWING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
LOOKING FOR MOLLIE AND THE
INVESTIGATORS ON THE CASE?
>> STANDING HERE LOOKING AT ALL
OF YOU, TIME IS COMPRESSED.
DAYS SEEM LIKE WEEKS AND WE'VE
ALL BECOME A FAMILY.
I SEE ALL OF YOUR FACES, I
RECOGNIZE ALL OF YOU, WE'VE ALL
SPOKEN MANY TIMES.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH WE
APPRECIATE YOU.
YOU'RE ALL WORKING 16, 18-HOUR
DAYS JUST LIKE THE INVESTIGATIVE
TEAM.
YOU'RE LIVING OUT OF SUITCASES.
ALL SO YOU CAN SHARE THIS STORY.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO BRING MOLLIE
BACK AND WE ARE DEEPLY
APPRECIATIVE OF ALL OF OUR
PARTNERS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND ALL OF YOU.
WE CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL
WE ARE AND WE'LL CONTINUE.
YOU CALL US, WE'LL SHOW UP.
WE'RE UP AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING.
WE'LL HELP YOU ANY WAY YOU CAN
BECAUSE YOU'RE HELPING US.
WE'RE GRATEFUL.
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT INDICATED
THEY HAD SEEN AN INCREASE IN
TIPS SINCE THE LARGER REPORT WAS
ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY.
ARE YOU ENCOURAGED BY THAT, THAT
IT IS GENERATING MORE?
>> VERY, VERY MUCH SO.
THEY HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB OF
PULLING THIS ALL TOGETHER.
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO
COMMENT ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS AND
HOW PEOPLE ARE STREAM LINING THE
PROCESS AND HOW THEY CAN
CONTRIBUTE.
MY MESSAGE TODAY JUST OCCURRED
TO ME STANDING ALL COLLECTIVELY
TOGETHER, HOW WE'VE ALL BECOME A
FAMILY JUST IN THE FEW DAYS
TOGETHER, SO JUST THANK YOU ALL
VERY MUCH.
BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE
MEDIA.
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, FOLKS.
.
>>> YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO A
NEWS CONFERENCE IN IOWA ABOUT
20-YEAR-OLD MOLLIE TIBBETTS.
OFFICIALS WOULD NOT COMMENT ON
SUSPECTS OR LEADS IN THE
INVESTIGAION.
THEY SAID THEY WERE TAKING ALL
TIPS SERIOUSLY.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK
BREAK NOW.
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, CBS NEWS,
ALWAYS ON.
