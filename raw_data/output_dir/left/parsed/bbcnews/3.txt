Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome your host
for tonight, Sofie Hagen.
CHEERING
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Hello and welcome to
BBC Ouch Storytelling Live.
CHEERING
The stories we're
going to be hearing tonight
are about love and relationships
and I do have a very
long lasting relationship
with my psychologist.
Am I right, BBC Ouch people?
High five. High five.
I've seen my psychologist
for ten years now. Ten years.
She's incredible.
But she's always trying to
help me get out of, you know,
all my mental health issues,
and there's quite a few.
We have depression, we have anxiety
and binge eating disorder,
which is the cool one.
I don't know if you know about that.
It's where you eat
so you can't feel anything. Right?
Cos there's a lot of pain inside
because, you know,
you can feel the bones
if you just swallow them and...
So there's a lot of pain
right in my throat...
after a good piece of chicken.
My psychologist is amazing. She's
a very, very good psychologist,
an incredible psychologist.
For those of you
who can't see me, I'm fat...
and that's not a bad thing.
That's not a bad thing.
I like being fat. I love my body.
I think everyone should...
love my body cos...
CHEERING
Yeah! Why wouldn't you?
But that means sometimes people give
me advice on how to lose weight.
People would be like, "Oh,
you should stop eating sugar,"
and I'm like, "I can't stop eating
sugar cos then I'll feel...
"I'll feel."
And that's the reason I eat
is to not feel all the feelings.
I have depression and anxiety.
I don't want to feel my feelings.
My psychologist once
tried to fix it.
She went... We were trying to deal
with some of the feelings that
I don't know how to show.
For example, anger.
I'm very bad with anger.
I don't know how to express anger
so when I do express anger,
it kind of explodes, right?
So she tried to fix that,
so she said to me, "You know,
"next time, next time you feel
angry, just try and express it."
I said, "Oh, no.
"No, I don't think that's...
I don't think that's ...
"There's not enough food
in the world for me to feel angry.
"I'm sorry,
that's not going to happen."
And she said,
"Listen, this is what you do.
"Next time you feel angry, you just
say the words, 'I am angry.' "
I said, "OK, this is on you."
I went from that session, I was very
pleased with what I was about to do.
I was like, "OK, I'm going to go
out and I'm going to actually try
"and feel my anger and
I'm going to try and express it."
And I was practising the sentence,
"I am angry. I am angry,"
for the next times that could
happen, I could say that out loud.
And I met with my friend, my best
friend. Her name is Ina.
Ina's beautiful. Ina's
a very optimistic, happy person.
She's always smiling.
Just the most...
She believes in things like love...
LAUGHTER
What an idiot, right?
And she met me at the station
and I hugged her and she said,
"Oh, my God.
I'm so happy to see you."
I said, "I'm so happy to see you."
She said, "Want to go for dinner?"
I said, "Yeah, I'd love
to go for dinner."
"What do you feel like eating?"
"Oh, I don't know.
I feel like having pasta."
She said,
"Oh, I feel like having Greek food."
And then I punched her in the face.
I punched her in the face.
I saw this happen in slow motion.
I was like, "Oh, no!"
I could just see, and my fist was
like, "We're expressing feelings!"
and my heart was like,
"Don't do it!
"This is what we were afraid of!"
And I saw my fist just hit
her stupid, smiling face.
She never once stopped smiling.
She was just like,
"OK, we'll have pasta.
"I think you're too passionate
about this." I felt so bad.
I didn't know what to do.
I'd hit my friend.
I don't want to be the kind of
person to hit a friend
and I felt so bad
and she was just looking at me
with her big, blue eyes
and I didn't know what to say
so I just went, "I am angry."
And I stopped feeling feelings
for the rest of my life.
That's somewhat of a fairytale.
I would love to introduce you
to the first person on this stage.
Are you up for being very,
very nice?
CHEERING
Or course you are!
Please give it up for your first
person of the night,
it is Ruby MacKellar!
Everybody's already
taken all the good disabilities,
so I got left with dyspraxia.
It's a developmental
coordination disorder.
It's the sort of less sexy
cousin of dyslexia,
which you'll have heard about.
So it largely affects motor control
and speech and memory
and information processing.
What generally happens
is that I fall over a lot
and I cock everything up,
so this is a warning.
Watch this space.
So, I love living alone,
because people,
and so my favourite
activity is sitting alone
on the sofa in my pants
watching telly.
All about that.
So I can't actually keep pets
or house plants alive,
so I certainly can't keep love
and affection alive.
It's far too much commitment,
generally.
I did a bit of online dating and
then it plays on your insecurities.
It's a terrifying thing to do,
cos you're waiting there
to meet this date,
and you've written your profile,
and you're thinking, 'Well,
'maybe taking ten years off my age
was a bit much, and I did use
'really flattering photos, and I did
pretend I wasn't actually mental.'
So I was a bit worried about what
they were going to think.
So you're waiting there,
you're waiting to see him,
and you're thinking,
'He'll be all right,'
because people are better than that.
The mainstream media would have us
believe that everybody is
shallow and obsessed with
how you look,
but I find that's not my experience
with real people.
Real people will see behind the mess
that you often are and think,
"No, you're a beautiful person,
you're a real person, I like that."
So I was feeling buoyed up about it.
So I see him coming out the station,
I clock him.
I think, "Oh, you minger!"
And often with the dyspraxia,
I come over as very loud
and sweary and scary initially.
If I don't know people especially,
I just get a bit overpowering,
overwhelming and people do get
nervous around me.
This is what they've said.
Obviously it's nonsense and I will
fight anyone that says otherwise.
This is just a classic, apparently,
dyspraxia symptom I hadn't realised.
I used to think I was just this
fascinating personality
with all these quirks,
and I was so interesting.
I discovered I'm nothing but a list
of symptoms and I was very upset.
I've nothing below it,
I'm entirely two-dimensional.
I'm just a condition.
So, this date's looking
a bit nervous already and that's
before the content of what I've said
has become apparent.
This is just the presentation alone
that's scaring the guy.
So I thought, 'We'll go to
the nearest pub,' traipsing along.
So I'm going along as I usually do,
stumbling over, tripping over,
talking loudly, waving my arms
around, hitting lampposts,
and then we try and get into
the pub and the bouncer bars me.
"No, you're not coming in."
I said, "What?"
And the guy says,
"No, you're obviously too drunk.
"You can't come in."
I do get this a lot.
Not always when I'm drunk,
obviously.
So I thought, "I'll argue with him,"
because as we all know,
arguing with a bouncer is
obviously... You obviously win.
You're never going to lose that
argument, talking to bouncers.
So I say to him, "Mate, come on,
this is because I'm Scottish,
"isn't it? You just assume
I've been drinking all morning."
So I'm not being gracious in defeat.
I'm just swearing and stomping off
and having a go at him
under my breath,
and gently vindicating him
that I just shouldn't be allowed in.
But I was thinking I was looking
quite good cos I'm in my heels,
I'd put my high heels on especially.
And I can't walk in high heels.
Cannot.
Can barely stand in high heels,
but this doesn't stop me.
I'm in complete denial.
I imagine it makes me look
like some girlie,
delicate little flower,
all sanguine and sexy,
and not like the angry tractor
that I usually look like.
Inevitably, though,
we're going along and I fall.
And I don't fall in the way I think
I would fall in my head,
like, oh, I fell, oh...
..as I would like to fall.
No, no, no.
I come along, I stack it on
the pavement, and it was just
this terrible mess of everything.
Everybody's aware of it.
And my top tip for this...
I've got an MO because
I fall over so many times
..is don't style it out.
Just stay on the ground,
because otherwise
you'll be just mocked.
People will just stand there going,
"I'm filming it for YouTube.
"That's hilarious."
You stay down, they start to worry.
"Oh, hang on..."
LAUGHTER
"Might actually be seriously hurt.
"And how bad will I look
if I'm laughing?"
So stay on that floor,
listen to it all around you.
You've got your pride,
stay on the ground.
The date kind of picks me up off
the ground and I'm quite galled
that he didn't prevent it happening
in the first place,
I'm already resentful.
But fortunately
this has taken place outside a pub,
so...obvious course of action.
So, inside the pub,
I go in and the landlady sees me
coming in, bleeding everywhere.
She comes over with rolls
of toilet paper,
trying to stem the bleeding
and save the furniture.
They send someone off for TCP,
so I'm sitting there in the pub
with blood, tissues, pouring this
over my leg because that adds to
an ambience of a sexy date, I find,
the smell of TCP everywhere.
Who doesn't love that?
At this point I was
cracking open the wine.
At this point I am drinking.
So obviously within seconds
I'm crying into the wine.
"Everything is so difficult!
Why is this happening to me?"
At this point I remember
you're meant to chat, aren't you?
It's small talk, conversation,
which I can't do.
I don't understand.
So I'd written little cues up my arm
and tried to pass it off
as a tribal tattoo on my arm.
So I'm chatting away.
"What do you do?
"Where do you live?
"Pause for a response."
Oh, shit!
So it was every bit as scintillating
as you might imagine.
So we decided to leave.
We left if our own volition,
which is always a win,
if I'm not being asked to leave
or anything, so that's a top time.
Couldn't ask for better than that.
So then I just get back home
and try and forget all about it.
I watch cartoons, sit on the sofa
in my pants, watching telly.
Equilibrium is restored.
But then, a few days later,
I hear from the date. He texts me.
He wants to see me again.
Why? Why would you
put yourself through that?
What sort of person would want
to experience all that again?
What sort of self-esteem
problems do you have?
It's absolutely ridiculous.
I think, "God,
I don't want to know anyone
"that wants to go out with me
again. What a loser!"
LAUGHTER
And that will be one of the many,
many reasons I've been single
for ten years.
And thank you for laughing
at my misfortune,
I'm very glad that you did.
CHEERING
Give it up for Ruby MacKellar!
Oh, my God.
That was her first time
ever on stage.
CHEERING
I've slept with worse comedians
than that. That was amazing!
We are about to have another
storyteller on the stage.
Are you ready for that?
CHEERING
Please give a warm round of
applause to the amazing Mik Scarlet!
CHEERING
Now, when I first discussed with
the BBC Ouch team what I'd be
talking about today, I said,
"Can I talk about how I met
"my wonderful wife?" who is sitting
just there. Hello, wonderful wife.
"A romantic story of seeing her
across a crowded dance floor
"and how I immediately knew
that she was the one for me?"
"No," they said,
"No, that's really boring.
"What we want is something edgy,
"something that's going
to push boundaries."
And then I thought, "I know,
I'm going to talk about my willy,
"and sex, because that's edgy,
isn't it?"
I woke up one morning,
on the morning of my German O-level,
and found that my legs hurt and
my back really hurt and every time
I tried to stand up I fell over.
So of course an ambulance
was called, I was rushed to hospital
and it transpired that
my spine had collapsed.
Yes, it is true, folks, you can
break your back in your sleep.
I just thought I'd tell all you
bipeds that just to make your day.
Ha-ha-ha!
So, eventually I came out of
hospital and as you can tell,
I had lost the ability to walk.
There was no more standing for me.
There was also no more
standing to attention down there.
I had lost what the doctors call
erectile function.
I knew that would happen,
complete silence.
So, I thought, "That's it,
game over, man, game over."
I thought that was it.
So I got really down and depressed.
I thought, "I know,
I'll become what's known as
"the world's best male friend,"
and all my girlfriends would come
round and I'd do their hair
and I'd do their make-up
and I'd dress them all up
and then I'd send them out on dates,
normally with blokes wearing
leather jackets -
which is why I now wear leather
all the while - on mopeds,
and if they were real bastards,
they owned a Ford Capri,
which, trust me, when I was young,
was a giveaway sign that it was
going to be bad.
And then what would happen is,
that night she'd come back round
my house and cry on my shoulder,
going,
"Mik, he had sex with me
and then he dumped me!
"Oh, why can't boys be like you?"
I, of course, didn't see this
as what I would now
obviously recognise as a come-on.
What I thought was,
"They're never going to want to be
with me because I can't do it."
So I would be like, "Oh, yeah, don't
worry, next time you'll be fine."
One of my best female friends
came to me and said,
"Look, Mik, I've met this girl
and I think she's great.
"Will you come to a party and
meet her and all of her friends?"
"Yeah, of course." So I arrived.
I was the one wearing the most
make-up in the room.
We're all there and we're
all getting on famously and then,
as was the fashion back then,
it was time for a game and everyone
said, "Let's play truth or dare."
We always played truth or dare
at every party.
I don't know why, because it always
ended up with a row,
normally because we were either
too truthful or too daring,
normally too truthful.
But I thought, "This could be it.
This could be my chance.
"I can tell my secret."
Because up until then,
I'd kept it quite quiet.
My brother didn't know,
my mum and dad didn't know,
even my doctors didn't know.
I was keeping it in.
Yes, I was going to admit
to Mr Floppy.
It was going to be great.
Were they sympathetic?
Were they caring?
Not at first.
You know when someone laughs just
beyond that point where it's just,
"Hang on a minute, it's not funny
any more I'm feeling really upset"?
It was that.
But eventually my friend wiped away
the tears, got her breath back,
came up, stood up,
got up off the floor,
whacked me round the head and said,
"Mik, you idiot.
"We're girls. We don't have willies.
"And we make love to girls
and we do it very well."
"Yay," they all cried, of course
they did.
I thought, "Duh."
I honestly hadn't worked that out,
which kind of shows how innocent
I was as a teenager.
So, at the time,
lesbianism and feminism were very,
very closely associated
and they were very radical,
these girls, and they truly believed
that what was wrong with the planet
was men and their erectile function
and penetration.
All penetration was bad.
So suddenly I was this new
type of man, a man that
had the next evolutionary leap
for man, according to these girls,
and they thought it was great.
I really liked these girls.
They were cool.
And they took me under their wing
and they even made me
an honorary lesbian.
And I used to go on lesbian marches.
There was me and a lot of girls
and just this bloke
wearing lots of make-up,
looking like Boy George on wheels.
Kind of like a cross between
Boy George and a Dalek, going,
"Yeah, down with men!
Men are bad, yeah!" Right?
And they also taught me how to
make love to a woman like a woman.
Now, I wonder how many people here
are imagining some kind of
weird pornographic thing.
No, I'm still a guy,
they still wouldn't have
gone near me.
They just taught me -
told me with words, not actions.
Sadly, but there you go.
And when I was telling the BBC,
actually, about this, they said,
"Are you going to tell anyone? Are
you going to tell us what they said?
"Please tell us!"
Well, no, I'm not. No.
I'm afraid I'm not letting you know,
because that would be
betraying the sisterhood
and actually
letting all those trade secrets out.
So, girls,
if you want to know what it's like,
you're just going to have to make
love to a woman.
Thank you very much and goodnight.
CHEERING
Give it up for Mik Scarlet!
That was amazing. I think everyone
could learn from that story,
everyone.
Everyone!
If anyone wants any pointers,
I'll be at the bar.
Are you ready for another
storyteller?
CHEERING
Yes! Then please put your hands
together,
give it up for the amazing
John Servante!
CHEERING
I told a fundamental lie
to get here tonight.
The producers phoned me
a couple of weeks ago and said,
"Right, John, just so you know,
the event is going to be at
"Bethnal Green and in front of
a live audience."
I said, "Sorry, what?"
They said, "Bethnal Green."
I said,
"No, that's not the problem."
So, for many years I have
suffered from depression.
Now, what does that actually mean?
Some of you might say if
your goldfish dies or nobody likes
your Facebook status that
you have depression.
For me, it's a little more
persistent than that.
I suffer with major depressions
that can last for weeks,
maybe even months at a time.
I have feelings of
malaise and sadness
and sometimes even
suicidal thoughts.
To put it another way, according to
Professor Robert Sapolsky,
I have a neurological disorder with
a biochemical and genetic component
where I just can't
appreciate sunsets.
I was diagnosed when I was
a student at university.
This made me quite unpopular.
I studied English, but even
the Gothic literature fans
thought I was
a bit too morose and depressing.
LAUGHTER
In my final year as a student,
I decided I wanted
to leave university as
a proper undergraduate,
so I needed to get wasted,
I need to go out clubbing
and I needed to get off with
some random strangers.
My more sensible therapist suggested
I should just join a society.
So eventually I settled upon drama,
because it's socially acceptable
for a director to sit in a dark room
and just yell, "This is awful!"
So, at the time,
a new friend of mine, Avine,
offered to help me put on a play.
Now, Avine was a very talented
theatre student
and she was also just
a really lovely person.
When she'd found out about
my condition,
she confided in me that she had
a family history of mental illness.
So after, you know,
making a bit of a bond with Avine,
I discovered this was somebody
I could work with.
She was not the kind of person
who was ever going to ask me,
"Can't you just cheer up?"
because she understood that was like
asking a wheelchair user to stand.
So, she encouraged me to be more
open and honest with people
and that kind of helped me
get into the whole drama thing.
After she organised some auditions,
I realised I faced a huge challenge.
The antidepressants I was taking
at the time meant that
I couldn't concentrate for
any length of time.
I would sort of zone out or just
completely lose focus altogether.
So, how was I going to make it
through an audition?
Well, I came up with a simple
and incredibly stupid idea.
Without consulting my doctor
or weaning myself off,
I just stopped taking
my antidepressants.
What was the worst
that could happen?
So, the first day, true enough,
nothing happened, I was fine.
The second day I felt a bit dodgy
but, you know, it was all good.
By the day of the auditions,
I woke up a member of the mumbling,
stumbling dead.
I had a headache, I couldn't really
concentrate on anything,
I felt disorientated and
I felt very, very nauseous.
If you ever want to wreck an actor's
confidence, just say to them,
"Sorry,
could you do that line again?
"I was trying not to vomit."
Avine was unbelievably angry with me
that I'd just decided to stop
taking antidepressants.
And in the car journey
on the way home,
I decided to sort of break the ice
and I said to her,
"So, who do you think
were the best actors today?"
And as she listed
all of these different people,
I started to get
more and more angry.
She was mentioning all of the sort
of stereotypical attractive types.
You know, the young men and women
with sort of designer clothes
and trendy haircuts and gym bodies,
which I really hated at the time.
I said, "You know what?
"I never thought of you as the kind
of sort of shallow human being.
"I thought you were a nicer person
than that. You confided stuff in me.
"I'm actually starting to think
you're a pretty bad person.
"Maybe I don't want to make
this play with you any more.
"Maybe you don't really understand
the subtle nuances of human pain."
She said, "Well, I'm not
a superficial person at all,
"actually." I said,
"Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.
"You're just lying to me."
So she started to have a go at me
but she calmed herself down
and stopped because, you know,
she's a lovely, empathetic person
and I'm not.
I said, "I bet you've never been
interested in somebody who's
"maybe over six foot,
"a bit kind of lanky."
I just start going on this
diatribe about how, you know,
there were ugly people in the world
who are really nice, too,
because when you're suffering
with depression,
you go through this period of
wanting to make sure everybody else
knows that you're feeling shit
and you want them to
kind of feel shit as well
because it becomes like your
moral duty to point out to everybody
that the world is a really, really
bad place and it's really dark
and all those smiles
that you see in the crowd,
they've just got to go, because
they're deliberately designed to
offend you and everything's
morose - what's wrong with you?
I haven't got a problem -
you've got a problem!
And she sort of, as if she
could hear all this nonsense
churning about in my head, said,
"You know, I actually like
plenty of unusual people."
I said, "Oh, yeah? Yeah, really?
You're a liar. That's what you are.
"You're a liar.
You don't like anybody unusual.
"Who do you like who's unusual?
Go on, tell me.
"Who do you like who's unusual?"
She said, "Well...
"you."
Now, I dealt with this really well.
I just let a silence rest over
the car for about five minutes.
I was thinking whilst I was driving
along, "Why would she...? What?
"No. There's been a mistake here.
I've misunderstood things.
"She didn't mean that she likes me
because nobody likes me and...
"and I'm misanthropic and I know,
I've heard the voices, they told me
"I'm going to be forever alone
and that's my destiny from now on."
As I pulled up to my student house,
I turned to her and,
with a cringing earnestness, I said,
"Why would you say that?"
She was too embarrassed
at this point to look at me
and she just said,
"Well, I know that, you know,
"you don't feel the same
but that's how I feel and...
"and...yeah, I do like you
and...and... So there.
"I know we're just
going to be friends
"but I've put it out there now."
A couple of days later,
I decided to ask her on a date.
Because, of course,
if it all went wrong
and I vomited on her or something,
it would just prove my worldview
that everything was terrible and
I could go back to being depressed
and happy with my depression.
But, to my surprise, it went well,
very well, and to this day,
some three and a half years later,
we are still together.
CHEERING
So depression's a difficult
condition to live with.
It can often be a bit
like trying to find land
when you're on this
sort of dark and black sea.
But however lost I get in
my own thoughts and my misery
and my stupid, stupid ramblings
and wanting to make other people
feel crap about themselves,
I always have
a shining light that anchors me
and invites me to come home
and that's my lovely girlfriend.
AUDIENCE: Aww!
CHEERING
Give it up for John Servante!
APPLAUSE
OK. Who needs a hug now?
LAUGHTER
Right? Right? Oh, my God.
I would cry if I had a soul.
So bloody beautiful. Are you ready
to see another storyteller?
CHEERING
Of course you are. Please welcome
to the stage Georgie Morrell.
CHEERING
My story isn't about
romantic love, as such,
but it is about some of the most
significant relationships
of my life.
My mum's helping me have a bath.
Yes, it's weird.
Actually, it's tragic.
She's helped me have a bath because
at this point
I have lost my sight
for a couple of weeks at this stage.
It's been a couple of weeks
and, long story short,
I have been blind
in my left eye since I was 16
and at the age of 21
my other eye's decided,
"That looks like a laugh.
"I'll copy that."
The doctors don't know what to do.
They don't know whether they can
restore my sight, when, if,
and I'm in what I can best
describe as a blind limbo.
Not too sure what's going to happen.
Mum's helping me have a bath.
I am mortified,
absolutely mortified.
She hasn't seen me naked in years.
She, however, surprisingly
comfortable in the situation.
Chatty, even.
Can't shut her up.
I think she's enjoying it
more than she should.
Me and my brothers
have flown the nest,
we've all grown up and one has
come back with a broken wing,
or eye in this instance,
and she gets to play doting mother
again, like she used to.
And I have to admit she's
terribly, terribly good at it.
My mortification
quickly turns to despair.
I don't know whether I'll get
my sight back, I don't know when.
It's not the blindness that's
getting to me, it is this unknown.
Do the doctors know
what they're doing?
Will Mum have to bathe me forever?
And more than anything,
it's not that I don't love my mum
and my dad and the family home
that I've had to move back to at 21,
it's...it's not the life I had.
It's not my sexy London life that I
was just living as a postgraduate,
spending my dad's money
and partying.
Essentially what I did.
Partying in London, in Soho,
Camden, Bethnal Green. Wahey.
And it's not the dreams I had of
being a famous one-eyed comedian.
I have a flannel across my eyes.
My mum insists on it.
She's rinsing my hair. She doesn't
want water to get in my eyes.
I really don't see
the harm at this stage.
What's a bit of water?
I want to cry.
I really want to cry but I don't
want my mum to see me cry
and I think, "I could cry into this
flannel and she wouldn't know."
And just before
I can squeeze one tear out
to fall into the bath around me,
there's a knock
on the bathroom door.
It's my dad.
"Do NOT come in, Dad!"
It is one thing for Mum to see me
in the bath but not my dad.
That is really weird.
He's questioning the shopping list
that Mum's left out for him.
"What's the pink Vanish?" he says.
"It's for the carpet."
"Why? What's wrong with the carpet?"
Through the bathroom door,
this is, by the way.
"Don't question my list, Tony.
Just get it."
I laugh a little,
first time I have in a while,
because their bickering,
that familiarity
cheers me up a little bit.
I get out the bath and I sort of
dry myself off and I tell Mum
I can take it from here,
go into my room,
slip on a dressing gown,
towel dry my hair
and I plait it to one side.
It's weird what you can still
remember to do without seeing.
I sit on the end of the bed
and, as if on cue,
Mum's knocking at the door.
I don't know what it is with mums.
They know when you're upset and
they know they have to fix it,
as best you hide it from them.
I tell her it's not fair. I don't
know if I'm going to see again.
What are the doctors doing? Do they
really think...? Will I see again?
Which way is this going to go? Am
I going to have to move back home?
Will you have to bathe me forever,
woman? Surely not.
Before she can give me
any words of reassurance,
my brother has come into the room.
My big brother, Sam,
is the only man I love
more than myself...
but I also want to strangle
on a daily basis.
He says he's brought me
a glass of water.
He heard I was upset
and wants to cheer me up.
I say, "Thank you, Sam.
That's really, really sweet."
He hands it to my mum,
who goes to hand it to me.
Before my little hands can clasp it,
she snatches it away and says,
"Oh, for goodness' sake!"
"What? What's going on?
I just wanted some water."
"It's not water.
"It's an empty glass
with a spider in it."
Wish I was making this up,
some days, I really do.
I have never asked my brother
why he did that,
put a spider in a glass with
the hope of me eating it...
but I'm so, so glad he did.
Bear with me on this.
He runs off laughing his face off,
he's so pleased,
and I'm laughing hard.
Really the first chuckle
I've had in ages.
And I realise in that moment,
just because I'm blind
doesn't mean I can't make jokes,
I can't be the victim
of my brother's pranks,
I can't move back to London
and have the life that I intended
and be a one-eyed comedian.
And he made me realise that
and it was really, really special.
The word relationship, for me,
is far too basic a word
to describe those three people
in that dark year.
They became more than
my family members.
They were not just my mum,
my dad and my brother.
They were my eternal companions,
guiding me through that darkness,
always at my side.
There's every chance
I will go blind again...
..but I don't fear it
like I once did,
I really don't any more,
because I have a dad who will
guide me through crowds,
ready to put himself in harm's way,
a mum who will not flinch at her
crying, naked daughter in a bath,
and a brother who will make me
laugh at whatever cost.
It's experiences like these of
being disabled that bind you to
certain people forever and in that
I feel incredibly privileged.
Thank you very much.
Absolute pleasure. Cheers.

I think, for all of us
older siblings,
we feel much better now
about the torment
of our younger siblings.
I once tried to put my sister's foot
into the wheel of
a bike to break it.
The foot, not the bike.
Because my mum had been like,
"Oh, don't put your sister's foot in
the bike cos then this ambulance
"will come and they make weird
noises and it's so exciting and you
"have to go to the hospital, then
you can't go to school tomorrow,"
and I was like,
"Come on, Laura. Come on!"
Please start applauding,
whooping, cheering,

Gianluca Trombetta!

Hello.
So, I grew up with hearing loss,
moderately severe,
which means that essentially
I can't function in society
without my hearing aids.
So I've got these small devices.
The funny thing is that
I didn't wear them
until I was, like, 20 years old.
So for the first
20 years of my life,
I didn't hear much.
So how did I get by?
I essentially just hung out
with a lot of loud people.
Literally.
And so I grew up in Italy
so maybe you...
you've heard some of
those people over there.
I come from a family, we are 14
people, everyone is very loud.
You can't really understand
how loud they are.
Every time I go back for Christmas,
I have to take my hearing aids off.
It's...
It's just crazy.
So I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Elise.
She is British, from Newcastle,
but she doesn't have a Geordie
accent otherwise I'm not sure
I would understand
anything she's saying.
But she speaks very loudly
and she moves her hands a lot
and, as an Italian,
I find this very attractive.
The only thing,
she can speak quite fast.
You know, when we moved in together,
communication was
a little bit complicated...
..because she is not used
to speaking to someone
who has hearing loss,
so she speaks to me
as I have perfect hearing.
And even if I wear hearing aids,
the thing is that I can't hear 100%.
So, to give you an example,
if I am in the kitchen, busy,
doing something like cooking,
and you walk into the room and
start talking to me right away
when I'm not seeing you,
I can't hear, very likely,
the beginning of what you just said.
Even worse, if you speak to me
from a different room.
So I had to tell Elise,
"Look, when you speak to me,
"speak while facing me and speak
loudly, don't cover your mouth,
"don't mumble, etc, and don't
speak to me from another room."
But Elise will forget
about these things,
so I had to come up with my...
you know, with a new strategy.
So my strategy was dog training.
I was going to train Elise
as if she was a dog
and I thought that was a good idea.
So every time I couldn't hear her,
I would interrupt Elise
and I would call her by her name
and I would tell her
what she did wrong.
"Elise, you didn't speak
while facing me,"
or, "Elise, you were mumbling.
Elise..."
I'm annoying myself now.
Imagine how annoying it was to her.
So obviously I thought this was
a great idea and I kept going.
I took it one step further.
I introduced marks on the wall.
So we had...we had a chalkboard
at home, so I said,
"Elise, every time
you make a mistake,
"we're going to make
a mark on the wall,"
which didn't work out because,
believe it or not,
I realised one day
that she wasn't a dog.
What really worked, we decided
a couple of ground rules.
The first rule was that we would
always speak in the same room,
no exceptions.
And the second rule
was the attention rule.
So Elise would always try to
get my attention first
and I would up always give
my attention to her,
so I would stop doing
something and tune in.
This worked because
we were both relaxed
and we were open
to accept criticism so...
And it wasn't like I was trying to
interrupt her all the time,
which was really frustrating.
And Elise even came up with her
own ways of calling my attention
that wasn't by using
my name all the time,
which is a bit awkward in the house.
"Gianluca, Gianluca..."
So what she did was to
start using filler words.
So before starting to speak to me,
she would start saying,
"By the way," or, "You know what?"
And this was great because it
gave me the time to tune in
and I miss much less now,
but I still miss things,
but a beautiful thing is that
I don't get frustrated any more
because I know that she cares.
Thank you.

You're going to absolutely love her.
Please start whooping
and cheering and applauding

CHEERING
All right there?
Wear an outfit that sums up
mental health. You're welcome.
That's my thing.
I've got bipolar and it's caused
some mayhem in my relationships.
I've got a boyfriend at the minute
and he's, like, proper the one.
It's absolutely lovely, so I doubt
you want to hear about that.
But before such an
understanding boyfriend,
this guy I was seeing had a problem
with me doing stand-up comedy,
I think, because... I'm melting.
..because he... I think he thought
it questioned his manininity.
I don't think that's a word,
Harriet. No.
And so he kept telling me
that his job was more important
and all of that and then one day
we were in bed and he was telling me
how good he'd be at comedy,
so he was pretending there was
a front row of...of...of women.
There were woman in
the front row and he was like,
"Yeah, if you don't laugh at my
jokes, you're obviously lesbians."
Yeah, that's the...
That's who I was dating.
And then he's seen my medication,
when I was taking it, by my bed,
and he's asked what it was,
and I'm quite an open book
so I said what it was and he goes,
"Does that mean you're
going to kill me in the night?"
It didn't mean that
but if you carry on talking...
The first time I thought I was in
love, I was at uni and this guy, oh,
I just couldn't believe that someone
like him would be interested in me.
He was so good looking.
But there were, like, signs
that maybe it wasn't to be.
Here was a sign.
Once we were in bed and
I've woken up in the night
with a very wet back
and I've gone,
"Why is my back wet here, pal?"
And he said, "Sorry, babe.
"I dreamt you were a urinal."
Dreamt I was a urinal,
wee'd up my back in the night.
That's not a keeper, is it?
And then when I was...
A keeper.
When I was at uni,
there was this girl
that I proper worshipped
the ground she walked on.
I thought she was wonderful.
She was a really strong,
independent woman, really funny,
really liked her,
so she became my best friend.
And then, after a while, going out
with this guy, I said to her,
my best friend, I said, "Something
doesn't sit right with me.
"I don't know, I don't trust him.
There is something not right."
And she... Cos obviously she's
my best friend
so I've opened up
about stuff and all that.
And she's gone, "No, Harriet,
this is just your mental health
"just telling you this,
it's all in your head."
I was like, "Oh, all right."
And then when I spoke to him
about it, he said the same thing
so I was like,
"Oh, OK. That's what happened."
They were together, right?
Yeah, how bad is that?
They were getting together.
And then when I proper caught them
in it, they were doing the whole,
"Yeah, but this is cos
of your childhood, Harriet,"
and this and that.
So it wasn't even what they'd done,
it was the fact they were using all
that against me and...it was so...
I was livid.
I was livid.
And so they were just lying at me
and I punched them both in the face
but because I'm not a fighter,
I've punched them both
in the forehead, right?
And I've broke both my hands.
Honestly.
And then, because they're just such
horrible people, that wasn't enough.
So I've gone home and then
she's rang the police, right?
So then the next morning,
I'm in my halls of residence
and I've got woken up by the
police and they've arrested me.
So then I've been carted to
a prison cell with this...
And they just put me
in the cell with this guy
and he had just one tooth,
and then he's just
shouting nonsense at me.
He said that he invented
toothpaste, right?
I said, "What are you on about?"
And it made me laugh
after all this nonsense.
So I've gone, "Mate, I don't
think you did invent toothpaste."
And he's gone,
"No, if you think about it,
"if someone with lots of teeth
invented toothpaste,
"it'd be called teethpaste."
I thought, "Oh, right. You can't
really argue with that, really."
And that is, honest to God,
is on my record forever.
Like, I used to do teaching
and that is just so sad
that that is on my record.
Pah!
Thanks ever so much. Cheers.
