every year hundreds of families apply to
adopt the foundations abandoned babies
bill keys and her assistants interview
all the couples who apply to see if they
meet their requirement to make it
everybody anything the couples must have
been married for at least ten years and
produce a medical report the proves that
they cannot have children most
importantly they must own a house and
have a good income push medallion
Alec was telecoil a Mamba trolley oh do

connect it takes just a few minutes and
at the bill case to decide and the child
will be adopted just as quickly as she
was abandoned

midwives prepares the little girl for
her new home
actually yogi yogi dude channel actually
yogi Salam alaykoum a day yeah yeah Joe
two women arrived faces cover in
Pakistan adopting is considered a
shameful sinner the adoptive mother in
black does not have her husband's
permission to talk to her so it's the
grandmother who answers our questions
she wanted a baby and she was not having
it and her baby died so then she was
very upset so then one day we came here
last month only when we came
no that is a secret teacher that's a
total secret whatever you don't want to
know no no we don't know what will we do
it's our baby no it's a child we will
tell everyone it's our child the
families who dare to adopt the
foundation promises to keep their
secrets

yeah okay family play problem now a
steady sleep sai-san turtle must live
with your thing a lot I delivered a
Muhammad a similar falling the adoptive
mother will register the child as if she
gave birth to her herself we still have
to decide
we will decide we have not yet decided
inshallah we'll try our best to give her
the best education everything this baby
girl will probably never know where she
came from
she'll never know about the crib or the
family who abandoned her or even the
fact that she was adopted
it's not just forbidden babies who are
in danger in Pakistan in this country of
180 million people we're a quarter of
the population lives in poverty

burden they neglect them lose them or
