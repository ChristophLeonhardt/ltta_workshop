Tucker: A POLITICIAN'S JOB IS TO APPEAL TO VOTERS. IT LEFT LEANING VOTERS DON'T LIKE THE NRA. PAT DAVIS IS A DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN NEW MEXICO. PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND DAVIS HAS PRODUCED A NEW AD WHERE HE EXPRESSES HIS VIEW OF THE NRA UNAMBIGUOUSLY, BUT YOU DECIDE. THE NRA. THEIR PROGRAM POLICIES HAVE RESULTED IN DEAD CHILDREN, DEAD MOTHERS AND DEAD FATHERS. I'M PAT DAVIS AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE IF CONGRESS WON'T CHANGE OUR GUN LAWS, WE ARE CHANGING CONGRESS. Tucker: PAT DAVIS JOINS US TONIGHT FROM NEW MEXICO. THANKS FOR COMING ON. HI, TUCKER. Tucker: THAT'S THE AD? KIND OF MORONIC, NO? THAT'S IT, JUST 15 SECONDS, BUT IT GOT A WHOLE LOT OF ATTENTION AND STARTED A NEW CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT. Tucker: DOESN'T IT DEGRADE YOU? YOU USE THE F WORD IN THE AD. YOU HAVE A POSITION STATED, BUT BEING THE LIGHT HASN'T MADE OUR SCHOOLS IN HIS FAVOR. IT HASN'T PROTECTED POLICE OFFICERS LIKE I USED TO BE. IF A CUSS WORD ON TV OFFENDS YOU MORE THAN DEAD CHILDREN IN PARKLAND OR NEWTOWN THEN YOUR PRIORITIES ARE WRONG. Tucker: IT'S NOT EITHER/OR. I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE A COP OR NOT. IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR. IT'S NOT THAT I'M SO OFFENDED. DO YOU THINK RUDENESS WILL? IS RUDENESS GOING TO SAVE LIVES DO YOU THINK? AS WE WERE LOOKING TO MAKE THIS AD, WHAT WE SAID WE KEPT COMING UP WITH THE SAME IDEA AND EVERY ADD, THIS ISSUE LOOKED LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S AND THOSE HAD NOT WORKED. CLEARLY THIS GOT THE NRA'S ATTENTION AND IT HAS STARTED THE NEW CONVERSATION BOTH AMONGST CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR OFFICE ABOUT WHO HOW WE ORGANIZE AND TAKE BACK CONGRESS AND PUT THE LEADERS THERE AND TAKE BACK ON CONTROL. AND ALSO HOW WE STAND UP TO THE NRA. WE KNOW WHAT WORKS. 50% OF NRA MEMBERS SUPPORT Tucker: A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW EMBARRASSING YOU ARE. HOW MANY NRA MEMBERS HAVE COMMITTED MASS SHOOTINGS? TUCKER, HERE'S THE THING. A MAJORITY OF AMERICA'S 89% OF POLICE OFFICERS, A MAJORITY OF NRA KNOW THERE ARE COMMON SENSE THINGS WE CAN DO. Tucker: YOU JUST RELEASED AN AD THAT SAID F THE NRA WHICH I'M SURE BACK AT YOUR FRATERNITY HOUSE THEY LOVE. BUT LET ME ASK YOU ONE ADULT QUESTION, HOW MANY NRA MEMBERS HAVE COMMITTED MASS SHOOTINGS? TUCKER, THIS IS ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF. MY FAMILY GREW UP Tucker: I'M ASKING YOU ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF. IT'S NOT THE NRA THAT MY DAD ORGANIZATION. Tucker: HOW MANY OF THEIR MEMBERS THEY HAVE MILLIONS OF MEMBERS. HOW MANY OF THEM I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THEM ALL WEEK. I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THEM ALL WEEK. THE NRA MADE US THEIR TARGET. WE STARTED A NEW CONVERSATION AND WHAT I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM OUR PARENTS IN HYDE PARK WHEN, IN VIRGINIA AND NEWTOWN WHO DONATED TO KEEP THE OUT ON THE AIR BECAUSE THEY WANT PEOPLE IN CONGRESS TO FINALLY STEP UP. IF THE NRA WANTS TO COME TO THE TABLE AND HELP US PASS COMMON SENSE REGULATIONS THAT THEIR MEMBER SUPPORT, LET'S DO IT. WE ARE NOT WAITING ON THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE. Tucker: TRYING TO HAVE AN ADULT CONVERSATION. HERE IS YOUR NEW SPOT. I WANT TO TALK THE POLICY AND SEE WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. HERE'S YOUR LATEST 152ND AD. BY THE TIME THIS AD IS DONE IN AR-15 COULD HAVE FIRED 150 BULLETS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. I'M PAT DAVIS, RUNNING FOR CONGRESS AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE LIVES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN GUN COMPANY PROFITS. Tucker: SO YOU JUST SAID THAT IN 15 SECONDS AND AR-15 CAN FIRE 150 ROUNDS. IS THAT TRUE? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GET IT RIGHT HERE IN NEW MEXICO. RIGHT HERE IN NEW MEXICO YOU CAN GO TO A PARKING LOT OR GO ON THE INTERNET, BUY AN ASSAULT WEAPON, AND AR-15 AND BY A LEGALLY AVAILABLE ADD-ON LIKE A BOMB STOCK THAT ALLOWS YOU TO REPLICATE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN LAS VEGAS. THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER 600 ROUNDS A MINUTE. Tucker: YOU ARE SAYING AND AR-15 CAN SHOOT 150 ROUNDS IN 15 SECONDS. LET ME ASK, LET'S BE SPECIFIC. IF YOU ARE AT. WHAT WITH THAT MAGAZINE LOOK LIKE YOU MIKE THE 150 ROUND MAGAZINE. EXACTLY LIKE THE MAGAZINES THAT LAS VEGAS POLICE OFFICERS PULLED OUT OF THAT HOTEL ROOM. Tucker: THERE WERE 150 ROUND 50 AND 100 ROUND MAGAZINE. Tucker: IT'S NOT. THESE ARE RHETORICAL QUESTIONS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER. NO AR-15 CAN FIRE 150 ROUNDS IN 15 SECONDS. THAT'S UNTRUE AND IF YOU BELIEVE IT IS TRUE THEN YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS. PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING AT YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE IGNORANT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE TAKE EXACTLY THE WORD OF THE POLICE OFFICERS IN LAS VEGAS WHO I TRUST WHO RAN INTO THAT ROOM TO SAVE PEOPLE DOWN BELOW AND FOUND A WEAPON MODIFIED WITH FARM STOCKS. Tucker: SO THEY SAY AND AR-15 WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN TO THE BARREL IN 15 SECONDS IF YOU PUT 150 ROUNDS IT WOULD MELT. I KNOW THEY GET HOT. Tucker: BEING MR. TOUGH, I WAS A COP GUY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT YOU DON'T. YOU ARE PUTTING ON TELEVISION SOMETHING THAT IS DEMONSTRABLY WRONG AND PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE AND ALL OF YOUR VOTERS ARE LIKE THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, HE WAS A COP, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR IT. I'M NOT APOLOGIZING FOR ANYTHING. Tucker: I THINK YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING SOMETHING THAT IS FACTUALLY UNTRUE. WE NEED NEW FOCUS. THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY. Tucker: BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SO MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN A POSITION TO MAKE DECISIONS BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE BECAUSE YOU JUST TOLD ME WITH A STRAIGHT FACE THAT IN AR-15 CAN FIRE 150 ROUNDS IN 15 SECONDS. IT CAN'T. MAYBE YOU SHOULD ADMIT THAT AND MOVE ON TO SOMETHING YOU UNDERSTAND, WOULD YOU DO THAT? THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF ARGUMENTS THAT DON'T GET US WHERE WE NEED TO BE. WE NEED NEW WE ARE MOVING Tucker: I THOUGHT POLITENESS DIDN'T WORK, TOUGH GUY? POLITENESS IS NOT WORKING SO FAR. YOU WANT SOMEBODY IN CONGRESS TO STEP UP. Tucker: WHY DON'T YOU GET SOME FACTS? DO LIKE THIS NEW MODE OF COMMUNICATION WE HAVE?
