-  On June 15th,
Billy Bob Thornton returns
to his Golden Globe winning role
in the new season of "Goliath".
He's a lawyer taking on another giant,
the criminal justice system itself.
Inspired by the shows themes,
we bring you the true
stories of three individuals,
each fighting for their own
cause against all the odds.
- I started my environmental
activism when I was nine.
A lot of people in the
South, the Los Angeles area
that were around the oil facility,
were getting really sick.
And in my personal experience,
I had frequent nosebleeds,
frequent headaches, stomach pains.
I got to the point where I couldn't walk.
I definitely believe clean
air is a basic human right
and it's not fair that
because of your socio-economic status,
you don't have access to that.
We sued the city of Los Angeles
for environmental racism
and a violation of CEQA,
the California Environmental Quality Act.
We won, they appealed.
We're still in court for that,
but that was definitely
a really big push for us
to make a change in the world.
- I have been speaking
up and advocating against
police gun violence and
state-sanctioned gun violence
since being a really young girl
and seeing unarmed black men being taken.
I'm a member of Women's March Youth,
which is the youth arm of the
National Women's March team,
and following the Parkland shooting,
we organized the March 14th walkouts.
We saw 2.7 million students walk out,
which makes it the largest student protest
since the Vietnam War.
- I wake up every day knowing
that I'm undocumented,
but also knowing that I've gotten so far,
so that gives me hope,
that gives me strength.
As an attorney, I don't want
to take no for my clients.
I wanna give them some hope.
I wanna give them a way to fight.
My client, Edith Espinal, is
one of my most extreme cases.
She lives in a church now.
She's fighting her deportation case,
so that she has a chance to fully explain
to the judge why she
fears returning to Mexico.
If there is any way to pass
any kind of immigration reform,
I would love to do that.
I would love to see that happen
in the next five years, 10 years.
Hopefully, we don't have to wait 25 years.
- The part that I put the most energy in,
is making sure my peers turn
out to vote this November,
because I really think
that that is the best way
for us to be heard and the
best way to see change.
- I definitely encourage everyone to do
what they believe is right.
It is very difficult and time-consuming,
but there's nothing like it.
-  Tune into the news to see
how these three incredible individuals
continue to make a difference.
In the meantime, stream
the new season of "Goliath"
June 15th on Prime Video.
