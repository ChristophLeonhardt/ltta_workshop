so an unfortunate and terrible death in Russia and under very mysterious circumstances and the official explanation is preposterous so let me explain journalists who had been investigating the deaths of alleged Russian mercenaries in Syria died in a hospital on a Sunday after falling from his balcony in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg and sohow Post is reporting this really interesting report let's give you more details the journalist is Maksim Borden he's a 32 year old reporter for ria Novi den news agency and he was known for his coverage of high-profile corruption and criminal cases he fell from his fifth floor balcony on Thursday let me tell you something those independent reporters in Russia that are covering corruption whether it's the oligarchs the government or anyone else in power in Russia those reporters are the bravest people on the planet a lot of mysterious deaths have happened to a lot of people trying to cover the corruption in Russia and Maksim Borden was one of them as you'll see here there were many different assaults that he suffered and he persisted unreal courage now local investigators said they were considering several possible cause of death but that no crime was suspected at this time really he's covering a Russian oligarch and the corruption and he happens to fall out of his fifth floor balcony you're not even considering a crime okay some of boorda's friends and colleagues however as how post explains have expressed skepticism at this assessment I share their skepticism one friend Polina Andrew Andreevna said in a Facebook post that Borden had been hospitalized earlier this month after a stranger attacked him outside his home hmm you're covering corruption and just earlier this month someone attacks you right outside your home well it's not the only time last October when assailant reportedly hit Borden over the head with a steel pipe shortly after he'd reported on a controversial movie about tsar nicholas ii so this guy keeps getting a time but the ones that happened this month I think are the most interesting and interesting that's not although a civil rights activist in in Russia named basarov said that Borden Borden had contacted him early in the morning on the day before his fall to say that men in camouflage and mass were surrounding his apartment he reportedly describes someone with a weapon on his balcony and others on the staircase landing gee I wonder if he actually fell and slipped off of his balcony on the fifth floor or perhaps it was the guys in masks and camouflage from the day before who returned the next day now Borden is a was a reporter so he then called Bank activists and said you know they they were probably doing a military exercise and so it's probably no big deal well you know god bless him for always wanting to check the facts and get him right and being skeptical by nature so are they really coming to my house these guys and masses cetera well it turns out in my estimation and in any sane estimation yes they were coming for him and they did get him and when the authorities say that it was just a slip and fall from the fifth floor balcony you got to be get a sense of why he was studying the corruption in the first place so now let's tell you about the guy that he was studying this guy has several different issues one was what he was looking into whether with the basically mercenary army in Syria another one is what is alluded to here Russian oligarch yevgeniy pure gozen is suspected of bankrolling the Wagner group the u.s. indicted him in February on charges of backing the so-called troll factory that spearheaded Russian efforts to influence a 2016 US presidential election so the oligarchy was looking into is the one that run or organized and financed a troll factory and the guy winds up getting thrown off a balcony now I don't think it was necessarily in regards to the troll factory or our elections because he was covering what the oligarch was doing in Syria so let's tell you about that and that was the the Wagner group and and so if and I think you should look into his reporting on that and they claim that that the US and the Russians and this is by the way backed up by Western media's some Western media as well already had contact in Syria that earlier dozens or maybe even hundreds of Russians might have died in a battle with US troops that is really interesting and the Russians do not want that to get out for a number of reasons I certainly don't want any further conflict there but on the other hand if the Russians have mercenaries there or a private army there that is also fascinating and that's the job of a reporter to uncover that now he's not the only person trying to uncover corruption that has met an unfortunate fate in Russia according to the European Federation of Journalists more members of the media have been murdered in Russia than anywhere else in Europe in recent decades between 1990 and 2015 346 journalists and media staff have been killed on the continent one third of these murders happen in Russia the group said so over and over again journalists are targeted and murdered there another reporter that was recently attacked we told you about on The Young Turks her name was Tatiana Fellig an hour she was stabbed in the neck she recovered and then had the courage to go to a Putin press conference and ask him a really tough question on national television with a giant scar on her neck the bravest people on earth so it's not just journalists let me give you more context into what happens in Russia sometimes Putin's enemies and even his diplomats right around our election time wind up also falling off of balconies lots of coincidences a lawyer for Putin foe Nicolai gore cough was reportedly thrown from a window March 21st in Moscow that's three months four months after our elections that's in 2017 however press outlets with ties to Russia security forces reported gore cough fell while trying to move a bathtub into his apartment Gourcuff was set to testify as a US government witness in a money-laundering case in New York he's about to testify in a money-laundering case against oligarchs he happens a slip while trying to put in a bathtub and fly out the window which person in their right mind believes these stories okay and finally and this is amazing on the morning of US election day Russian diplomat Sergei Kirov was found unconscious at the Russian consulate in New York and died on the scene initial reports said curve of fell from the roof and had blunt force injuries but Russian officials said he died from a heart attack by the way three of the Russians died certainly under mysterious circumstances here in the u.s. two in New York and one in Washington including the founder of RT what's our government doing do we really believe the Russians claims that a guy who was thrown off of a roof died of a heart attack well he might have died of a heart attack before he landed but he was thrown off a roof the other guy was thrown out a window at least that's not in our jurisdiction and in this case or a reporter now throwing off the fifth floor balcony I'm sorry slipped off of fifth floor balcony yet again all those slip and falls of opponents of Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs so I'm a progressive that doesn't mean that I think we should take military action against Russia or other things that would escalate the situation but if you think that people who oppose Vladimir Putin are welcomed in Russia in an open democracy you have no idea what's happening in Russia and one more time the reporters trying to uncover corruption in Russia hats off to them just absolute profiles and courage and it's a shame that the world is missing Maxim Bordin now a true hero if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm /join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart
