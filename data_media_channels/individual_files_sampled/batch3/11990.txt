the American president has signed a 1.3 trillion dollar spending bill to avoid a US government shutdown the plan was earlier approved by Congress despite being fiercely contested by both Republicans and Democrats there are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill there are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill but we were in a sense forced if we want to build our military we were forced to have after a lot of heated debates stressful afternoons and sleepless nights Donald Trump has finally signed the spending bill he had previously threatened a veto and as all the drama was playing out on national TV Americans were googling a new word omnibus omnibus translated from Latin as for all I've signed this omnibus thomna Bassam nippers budget bill this omnibus bill - a bipartisan amendment to the Omnibus Budget bill in the Omnibus the omnibus situations now the bill contains basically the entire federal budget and if it hadn't been signed into law by Donald Trump at this point the US federal government would have shut down again now Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky took to Twitter to expose some of the more bizarre things contained in the over 2200 page bill that contains over 1.3 trillion dollars in legislative spending page 447 a little over 30 billion dollars for the department's of energy wonder if anyone would notice we had no Department of Energy I found it I found it border security what President Trump wanted no wait a minute section says defense can spend what funds it determines to enhance the border security of Jordan Lebanon Egypt and Tunisia 961 million dollars to destroy our chemical weapons who was it exactly convinced our government to pay billions to develop weapons we're now find applaud contention related to the issues of immigration Democrats wanted protection for the daca kids these are people who entered the United States illegally under the age of 18 Trump wanted 25 billion dollars to fund his notorious border wall at the end of the day nobody got what they wanted the daca kids weren't even mentioned anywhere in the bill meanwhile Trump got a mere 1.6 billion dollars for his border wall that's supposed to be nearly two thousand miles long so the federal government is not shutting down they'll be free to keep spending Americans money despite the fact that we're already 21 trillion dollars into debt Congress is now taking a two-week recess on Capitol Hill it's not Hope and Change or make America great again the name of the game is gridlock
