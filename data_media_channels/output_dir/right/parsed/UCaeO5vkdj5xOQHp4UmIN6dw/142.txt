hey everybody I'm Andrew Klavan and
here's a first look at the amazing audio
and visual world we've created for
season two of another Kingdom I fought
to stay focused on the real world the
motel my swiftly approaching murder the
power of the locket flowed into my hand
my wrist my arm giving me more strength
I lifted the locket from the floor it
felt heavy as it had before heavy as a
rock
billiard balls sniffed absent-mindedly
as he's lifted the syringe in his right
hand and held it upward I took one last
glance around the blood-soaked room then
I stepped through the veil into another
Kingdom
and now season two of another Kingdom
you
