>>> WELCOME BACK.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,909
TALK ABOUT A BARBECUE AND BOOZE

3
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:13,243
BUMMER.

4
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:15,245
A NEW HEALTH WARNING THAT FINDS

5
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:17,514
OUT THAT NO AMOUNT OF BOOZE,

6
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:19,850
SAUSAGE OR BACON IS SAFE AT ALL.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,655
JOINING US NOW TO WEIGH IN IS

8
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:26,223
DR. MIKE WITH MAYBE NOT SUCH

9
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:27,324
GOOD NEWS.

10
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:28,292
DR. MIKE, SAY IT AIN'T SO.

11
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,527
>> YOU WALKED INTO THE LION'S

12
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:30,794
DEN.

13
00:00:30,794 --> 00:00:32,162
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE ALL

14
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,765
OF THE BOOZE, WE HAVE THE BACON.

15
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:37,467
IT'S THE HOLIDAYS, YOU HAVE TO

16
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:37,834
CELEBRATE.

17
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:39,603
WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT POINT FROM

18
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:40,637
THE GET GO.

19
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:43,073
BUT IF YOU EAT THIS TYPE OF FOOD

20
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,341
FOR CELEBRATION PURPOSES OR

21
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:46,410
EVERY NOW AND THEN, THAT'S NOT

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,711
WHAT THIS STUDY IS TALKING

23
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:48,045
ABOUT.

24
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:50,380
THIS STUDY IS TALKING ABOUT

25
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,582
EATING BACON EVERY DAY, 50 GRAMS

26
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:54,451
WORTH, FOUR STRIPS OF BACON AND

27
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,620
IT INCREASED THE RISK OF CANCER

28
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,487
15% TO 20%.

29
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,189
>> FOUR STRIPS OF BACON EVERY

30
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,523
DAY.

31
00:00:59,523 --> 00:00:59,956
>> EVERY DAY.

32
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:02,526
>> SO THE HEADLINE OF NO AMOUNT

33
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:03,026
NOT REALLY.

34
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,661
>> THIS IS WHAT SCIENTISTS DO

35
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:06,330
AND THIS IS WHY THE CLINICAL

36
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,931
DOCTOR WHO ACTUALLY SEES

37
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,033
PATIENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS, I

38
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,335
DISAGREE WITH THE LOGIC THEY'RE

39
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:12,035
TAKING HERE.

40
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:15,038
THEY'RE SAYING THAT NO AMOUNT IS

41
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:15,439
SAFE.

42
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,609
YES, IF THE RISK SLIGHTLY GO UP

43
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,712
BY 0.1% THAT MAKES IT NOT SAFE.

44
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:24,114
WHAT I DECIDE TO SAY FOR ME OR

45
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:25,816
MY PATIENTS IS TOTALLY

46
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:26,183
DIFFERENT.

47
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:26,850
THAT'S AN OPINION CALL.

48
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,118
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS

49
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:29,086
MAKE IT SCIENTIFIC.

50
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:30,787
I'M LOOKING AT THE HUMAN ASPECT

51
00:01:30,787 --> 00:01:32,189
OF THINGS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

52
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,724
A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT.

53
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:36,793
>> THIS YEAR AN ESTIMATED OVER

54
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:37,994
1.7 MILLION NEW CASES OF CANCER

55
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:40,230
WILL BE DIAGNOSED IN THE U.S.

56
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,666
CAN YOU TIE THAT TO DIET?

57
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,067
I MEAN BREAK THIS DOWN.

58
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,737
>> WELL THERE WAS A STUDY DONE

59
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:49,439
NOT SO LONG AGO THAT SHOWED 42%

60
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,142
OF CANCER CASES ARE CAUSED BY

61
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:53,009
PREVENTABLE FACTORS AND THE

62
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,645
LEADING CAUSE OF THAT WAS

63
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,114
SMOKING, OVERDRINKING, INDOOR

64
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,249
TANNING BEDS AND BEING OBESE.

65
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,984
YES, MAYBE BACON SLIGHTLY

66
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:01,618
CONTRIBUTES TO THAT.

67
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:03,420
AND IF YOU THINK OF THE PEOPLE

68
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,256
WHO EAT HUGE AMOUNTS OF BACON,

69
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,524
THEY'RE NOT EATING HEALTHY FOOD.

70
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:09,359
>> THAT'S TRUE.

71
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,294
NO FRUITS AND VEGGIES.

72
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:11,995
THAT'S ME.

73
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:13,764
I HAVE THREE TO FOUR SLICES OF

74
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:14,765
BACON EVERY DAY.

75
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,601
I REALLY DO.

76
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,136
WHY NOT CELEBRATE TUESDAY.

77
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:20,103
TUESDAY MIGHT BE THE LAST

78
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:20,704
TUESDAY I HAVE.

79
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,372
IF YOU WORK OUT, MAYBE YOU CAN

80
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:22,906
EAT BACON.

81
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:25,776
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING

82
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:26,209
TRADEOFFS.

83
00:02:26,209 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS
