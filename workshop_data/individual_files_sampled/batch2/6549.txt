officially revoked the security clearance of John Brennan he is the former CIA director and this appears to be a retaliatory move by the Trump administration Sarah Huckabee Sanders explained why during a press conference let's hear from her I'd like to begin by reading a statement from the President as the head of the executive branch and commander-in-chief I have a unique constitutional responsibility to protect the nation's classified information including by controlling access to it today in fulfilling that responsibility I've decided to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan former director of the Central Intelligence Agency as part of this review I'm evaluating action with respect to the following individuals James clapper James Comey Michael Hayden Sally Yates Susan Rice Andrew McCabe Peter struck Lisa Paige and Bruce or so Sarah Huckabee Sanders also mentioned as you can see from that statement a number of people who the Trump administration will consider revoking security clearance for now some might wonder well why do these people need security clearance if they're no longer serving the roles that they were previously in for instance CIA director John Brennan clearly isn't the CIA director anymore well sometimes what happens is there might be some sort of investigation some sort of issue that the CIA would want a former directors expertise on so that's one example of why that person would maintain security clearance another example would be you know doing work as a consultant because you have extensive knowledge as a former director of the CIA for instance so there are uses for having security clearance even if they're not serving in the CIA or some other intelligence organization but look the heart of this matter is not national security we all know that what this is all about is retaliating against people that Donald Trump does not like and Trump mentioned Brennan's erratic behavior really Brennan's the one with the erratic behavior like that's a little ridiculous there's no authority and erratic behavior like Donald Trump I mean come on and and so Brennan has been on the record very critical of Trump Trump does not like that Trump also doesn't like the Russia investigation or what anyone any official person would have to say about supporting the Russia and investigation so it is retaliation and it's pretty obvious it is retaliation and things that some people already know but you have to deny it's mob but so there's a way that they always play both sides so along with their statements there was also point where she said well someone asked her she was including John Bird and there's these people were chosen not because they were critics of the president but also in the statement she went on to say that uh his clearance was revoked because he's among a group of former officials who have quote transitioned into highly partisan people which one is it is it that they weren't chosen because they were critics that are present or it's because they've become highly partisan people oh maybe there are too partisan because they're too deferential to the president maybe they're too Republican and conservative because he's not Donald Trump works he does not like ass kissers so somebody is on his side constantly it's like you know what I need to revoke your clearance because you've just come way too partisan yeah no it's a great point that those two things are at odds with each other because obviously he's not getting rid of these people because they're too partisan on behalf of the president they're too partisan in criticism of many of the president's policies so of course you know this is the evolution of this executive branch we saw it under Richard Nixon when the enemies list of Richard Nixon was discovered in this case there's an enemies list in plain sight I mean this president goes after these people it's security clearances in on one day its headlines and tweets on another day for example Jeff Bezos who he became angry with because of Washington Post investigations and Washington Post stories that he felt were highly critical toward his administration he goes after Jeff Bezos by name and Amazon talking about them getting a break so this is all consistent with what is a politicization of the White House I mean it's obviously a political post but the executive branch going ass for political purposes u.s. citizens is an extraordinary thing right and and you have to consider this in the context of what's been going on with the executive branch throughout Trump's stint as president he has solidified executive power he has done things unilaterally he has pushed for ways to do additional things unilaterally one of the stories that we reported on last week was how the Trump administration is attempting to pass more policy unilaterally that would give additional tax cuts to big banks and so they don't want to do that through Congress and that completely circumvents the checks and balances that we have written in our Constitution it is part and parcel of what this country is supposed to be about checks and balances so look I'm not maybe it's wrong to say this but John Brennan losing his security clearance like I I care but it's not the end of the world he's gonna be alright but I do think this is a big deal in the grand scheme of things when you take this action into the context of power and the exacting side it's again they're not cross me or else I will punish it that part of the punishment is as you mentioned there was ways there's reasons that 1.3 million people by the way had these security clearances so these five or sixty is considered along with the three or four days already rejected I'm not sure exactly how much of a dent that is on people who have these security clearances but it's obvious that this is just a punishable thing one of the reasons that they have it again that you mentioned was to have other jobs so now it's gonna be harder for you to get a job in your field because you don't have the access to the information that you need to have to give the appropriate amount of advice or consultation whatever it is you need to do so it's punishing you professionally for having a point of view or at least voicing it to the American people is this that First Amendment thing it is such a great point I mean brendan is on the record criticizing Trump multiple occasions he criticized Trump yesterday after Trump had tweeted about Omarosa being a dog it's astounding how often you fail to live up to a minimum standard of decency and civility so he goes on seems like you never end and what it means to be president nor what it takes to be a good decent and honest person this is retaliation for criticizing the president this is this is what big government is right this is a someone who's outspoken outspoken against the executive but this isn't an executive abuse of power and Anna's right to point to the global nature that is the greater nature of this leave aside the Brenin thing this executive is designating certain institutions the press for example and certain members of the corporate community I gave you the example of Jeff Bezos but it goes way beyond that for retaliation and he is angered enough to actually try to create certain systems within the executive branch for him to retaliate that's what's so troubling about this because he does have a lot of power and he is able to create these additional institutions within the executive branch so and last point Anna talks about the increased tax cuts which might come through the executive branch without Congress think about this this Congress pretty much rubber-stamps what this guy wants mean they become sort of this cultish group that supports almost whatever he asks for I guess short of the wall funding so far but having said that you can't even agree to let them have the last vote on whatever additional tax cuts you want I mean it must really be a tough task if you can't even trust it to this Congress so I think it's also a part of that trying to increase executive power under his presidency and conservatives claim that they were concerned about that under the Obama administration but of course that was all you know fake concern because as soon as they have someone like Trump it's solidifying executive power increasing executive power you know more way more than Obama ever did they don't say anything about it and I want to give credit to rich Lowry who's an editor at National Review he's a conservative we disagree on a lot of things but he is one of the few principled conservatives that I've seen out there who actually does voice his concern about executive power and what the Trump administration is doing that is not an easy thing to do in today's climate because in today's climate you have the audacity to speak out against Trump is a conservative they come after you and he's mad what they did a Brennan I mean exactly it there's a sort of executive branch trolling that's going on that's just insane I mean it is a different environment as you say Anna I mean it really takes guts to step out at all
