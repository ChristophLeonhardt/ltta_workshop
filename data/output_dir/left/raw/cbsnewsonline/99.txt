1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:03,003
TO WORK WHO ARE STILL WORKING 

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,037
THERE TODAY. 

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:08,141
AFTER SELLING THAT IN 1997 I 

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,144
RAN FOR CONGRESS IN 1998 IN THE 

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,214
NIAGARA FALLS AREA KNOWING THAT 

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,015
MY BUSINSS EXPERIENCE WOULD 

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,717
BENEFIT THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK

8
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,787
AND OFFER A NEW PERSPECTIVE IN 

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:24,024
CONGRESS. 

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,125
AFTER BEING HUMBLED IN THAT 

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,326
RACE I SPENT THE NEXT 10 YEARS 

12
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,329
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR INVESTING IN 

13
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,897
AND HELPING TO STABILIZE DOZENS 

14
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,666
OF BANKRUPT AND FINANCIALLY 

15
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,403
DISTRESSED COMPANIES, SAVING 

16
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,804
AND CREATING HUNDREDS OF JOBS 

17
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,440
HERE IN WESTERN NEW YORK. 

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,010
IN 2007 I WAS RECRUITED TO RUN 

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,145
FOR ERIE COUNTY EXECUTIVE TO 

20
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,281
TURN AROUND THE EFFECTIVE 

21
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,783
BANKRUPT COUNTY. 

22
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:53,286
I WAS ELECTED AND BY APPLYING 

23
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,523
PRINCIPLES TURNED AROUND THE 

24
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,624
FINANCES IN 18 MONTHS. 

25
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,826
ALL THE WHILE HONORING MY 

26
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,929
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO WORK FOR ONE 

27
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,733
DOLLAR A MONTH. 

28
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,134
ONE OF THE MANY COMPANIES I 

29
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,270
INVESTED IN WAS A SMALL DRUG 

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,372
DEVELOPMENT COMPANY THAT WAS 

31
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,440
WORKING ON A UNIQUE CURE FOR 

32
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,576
HIV PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH 

33
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,911
AIDS. 

34
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,311
ULTIMATELY THAT FOCUS SHIFTED 

35
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:26,319
TO A TREATMENT FOR SECONDARY 

36
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:26,986
PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, 

37
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:27,920
WHICH IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST 

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,424
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES KNOWN. 

39
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,125
MY AFFILIATION WITH THIS 

40
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,426
COMPANY IS WHY WE ARE HERE 

41
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:33,726
TODAY. 

42
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,128
I HAVE BEEN AN AVID AND 

43
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:40,133
UNWAVERING SUPPORTER OF IMMUNO 

44
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,134
THERAPEUTICS LONG BEFORE I CAME 

45
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:46,105
TO CONGRESS OR BEFORE I WAS AN 

46
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:46,906
EXECUTIVE HERE. 

47
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,410
OVER THIS TIME MY AFFILIATION 

48
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,380
WITH THE COMPANY HAS HAD 

49
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,419
ATTACKS ON MY -- I BELIEVED IN 

50
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,222
THE COMPANY AND I STILL DO. 

51
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,323
AND IN THE POTENTIAL OF A DRUG 

52
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,424
THAT HAD THE REAL POSSIBILITY 

53
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,658
OF IMPROVING THE TREATMENT 

54
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,328
OPTIONS FOR SECONDARY 

55
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,428
PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 

56
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,764
PATIENTS, WHICH IS ABOUT THE 

57
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,267
MOST DEBILITATING DISEASE KNOWN 

58
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,569
TO MANKIND AND SOMETHING I SAW 

59
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,171
FIRSTHAND AFFECT A CLOSE FAMILY 

60
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,273
MEMBER. 

61
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,042
OVER THE YEARS I INVESTED 

62
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,310
HEAVILY IN THE COMPANY AND 

63
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,678
BECAME THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER 

64
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:29,415
AND AN UNCOMPENSATED MEMBER OF 

65
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,850
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 

66
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,019
WITHOUT MY INVESTMENTS THE 

67
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,222
COMPANY WOULD HAVE GONE UNDER 

68
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,727
BRINGING WITH IT A PREMATURE 

69
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,128
END TO A DRUG THAT I THOUGHT 

70
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,228
WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE TREATMENT 

71
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,864
OPTIONS FOR SECONDARY 

72
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,033
PROGRESSIVE MS. OF ALL THE 

73
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,334
THINGS I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN 

74
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,604
MY LIFE FINDING A CURE FOR 

75
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,472
SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MS WAS AT 

76
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,142
THE TOP OF THE LIST. 

77
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,143
AFTER YEARS OF BLOOD, SWEAT, 

78
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,212
AND TEARS, WE FIRMLY BELIEVED 

79
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,713
WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF A 

80
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,681
MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH. 

81
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,716
SADLY, DESPITE SHOWING GREAT 

82
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,918
INITIAL PROMISE, THE DRUG WAS 

83
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:08,254
SHOWN TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL, WHICH 

84
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,324
IS A SETBACK FOR ALL OF THOSE 

85
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,625
SUFFERING FROM THIS DEADLY 

86
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,927
DISEASE. 

87
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:15,928
MANY HAVE SPECULATED ABOUT MY 

88
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:16,796
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY. 

89
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,531
HERE ARE THE SIMPLE FACTS. 

90
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:23,136
MY CONNECTIONS ARE WELL KNOWN 

91
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,170
AND I BELIEVE I ACTED PROPERLY 

92
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,505
AND WITHIN THE LAW AT ALL TIMES 

93
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,840
WITH REGARD TO MY AFFILIATION 

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,310
WITH THEM. 

95
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,578
THROUGHOUT MY TENURE IN 

96
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,215
CONGRESS I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL 

97
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,015
RULES AND ETHICAL GUIDELINES 

98
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,417
WHEN IT COMES TO MY PERSONAL 

99
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,585
INVESTMENTS INCLUDING THOSE 

100
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,521
WITH THIS COMPANY. 

101
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,722
WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE 

102
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,923
DRUG THAT I BELIEVED IN FELL 

103
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,324
SHORT OF OUR HOPES AND 

104
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:46,959
EXPECTATIONS I HELD ONTO MY 

105
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,728
SHARES RATHER THAN SELL THEM. 

106
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,031
AS A RESULT THE SIGNIFICANT 

107
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,833
INVESTMENT I MADE IN THE COMPANY

108
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,336
WERE WIPED OUT. 

109
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,204
THAT IS OKAY. 

110
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,706
THAT IS THE RISK THAT I TOOK. 

111
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,308
MY REAL CONCERN LIES WITH THE 

112
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,311
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SUFFERING 

113
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,145
FROM SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MS 

114
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,181
WHO TO THIS DAY STRUGGLE 

115
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,315
WITHOUT LIFE-SAVING TREATMENTS 

116
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,018
FOR THE DEADLY DISEASE. 

117
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,319
I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE AND I 

118
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,288
WILL SAY IT AGAIN, I AM PROUD 

119
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:20,226
OF MY AFFILIATION AND I MAY 

120
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,427
HAVE LOST MOST OF THE MONEY 

121
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,328
THAT I INVESTED WITH THE 

122
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,630
COMPANY, BUT I TOOK THE CHANCE 

123
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,731
TO BRING RELIEF WITH THOSE WHO 

124
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,834
DEAL WITH THIS DREADFUL DISEASE 

125
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,102
OF SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MS 

126
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,705
EVERY DAY. 

127
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,706
THE CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN 

128
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,707
LEVIED AGAINST ME ARE MERITLESS 

129
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,143
AND I WILL MOUNT A DEFENSE TO 

130
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,144
CLEAR MY NAME. 

131
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,581
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING FULLY 

132
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,617
VINDICATED AND EXONERATED 

133
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,818
ENDING ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS 

134
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,355
RELATING TO MY AFFILIATION WITH 

135
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,424
THIS COMPANY. 

136
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,026
I'VE SPENT THE LAST 10 YEARS IN 

137
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,560
PUBLIC SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF 

138
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,428
CONGRESS. 

139
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,432
I HAVE ALSO SPENT MANY YEARS 

140
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,034
VOLUNTEERING TO GET BACK TO MY 

141
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:01,801
COMMUNITY. 

142
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,704
WHETHER IT WAS A MEMBER OF THE 

143
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,774
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OR A MEMBER

144
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:12,278
OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE 

145
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:17,583
KENMORE HOSPITAL, THE PUBLIC 

146
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,886
KNOWS MY DEDICATION TO WESTERN 

147
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,721
NEW YORK. 

148
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,524
BECAUSE MY FOCUS IS TO DEFEAT 

149
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,628
THE CHARGES IN COURT, AFTER 

150
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,729
TODAY I WILL NOT ADDRESS ANY 

151
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,632
ISSUES RELATED TO INNATE  

152
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,934
OUTSIDE OF THE COURTROOM. 

153
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,671
AS I FIGHT TO CLEAR MY NAME, 

154
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,239
REST ASSURED I WILL CONTINUE TO 

155
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,509
WORK HARD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE 

156
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,310
27th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF 

157
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,279
NEW YORK AND I WILL REMAIN ON 

158
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,513
THE BALLOT RUNNING FOR 

159
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,514
REELECTION THIS NOVEMBER. 

160
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,816
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

161
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:56,022
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.

162
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,623
>> THAT WAS CONGRESSMAN CHRIS 

163
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,693
COLLINS CALLING THE CHARGES OF 

164
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:06,199
INSIDER TRADING MERITLESS. I 

165
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,133
BELIEVE I ACTED PROPERLY AND 

166
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:14,173
WITHIN THE LAW HE SAID AND THAT 

167
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,074
DID NOT REALLY ADDRESS THE 

168
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:15,574
CHARGES AGAINST HIM. 

169
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,042
HE POINTED OUT THAT HE HELD 

170
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,678
ONTO ALL HIS SHARES WHEN HE HAD 

171
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:25,218
THIS INFORMATION AND THAT A KEY 

172
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,319
DRUG TRIAL HAD GONE BAD FOR 

173
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,520
THIS COMPANY AND HE WAS THE 

174
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,621
LARGEST SHAREHOLDER AND SAID HE 

175
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,522
LOST MILLIONS BECAUSE HE HELD 

176
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,156
ONTO THOSE SHARES. 

177
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,424
IS THAT THE DEFENSE FOR THE 

178
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,692
CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIM?>> NO. 

179
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,128
HE IS MAKING A STRONG CASE FOR 

180
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,330
WHY HE BELIEVED IN THE COMPANY 

181
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,431
AND THE DRUG. 

182
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,532
THE PROBLEM IS HE IS CHARGED 

183
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,068
WITH A MULTITUDE OF CRIMES AND 

184
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,702
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER HE 

185
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,404
LOST MONEY OR NOT. 

186
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,239
HE WAS NOT LEGALLY ABLE TO SELL 

187
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,707
THOSE SHARES BECAUSE OF A 

188
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,942
NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING 

189
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,277
BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE 

190
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,144
ETHICS COMMISSION. 

191
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:55,915
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HE 

192
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,716
HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 

193
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,584
CONSPIRACY AND LYING TO THE FBI 

194
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,520
AND WIRE FRAUD IN ALL OF THIS 

195
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,222
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE 

196
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,323
WHAT HE ULTIMATELY IS ACCUSED 

197
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,058
OF DOING IS TAKING NONPUBLIC 

198
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,327
INFORMATION AND SHARING IT WITH 

199
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,562
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL AND THAT 

200
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,797
PERSON TRADED ON THAT 

201
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,332
INFORMATION. 

202
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,167
THAT IS THE KEY FACT OF THIS 

203
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:15,367
CASE. 

204
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,270
>> WALK US THROUGH SOME OF 

205
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,374
THESE FACTS.>> HE GETS AN EMAIL 

206
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,708
FROM THE CEO OF THIS COMPANY 

207
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:27,213
úS 

208
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,614
WE KNOW IN A WRITTEN EMAIL BACK 

209
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,516
HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE RESULTS.

210
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,717
15 SECONDS TO ONE MINUTE LATER 

211
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,619
HE MAKES A PHONE CALL TO HIS 

212
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:33,819
SON. 

213
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,588
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PHONE 

214
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,357
CALL IS, BUT IF YOU PUT TWO AND 

215
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,259
TWO TOGETHER, YOU KNOW WHAT IT 

216
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,794
LOOKS LIKE. 

217
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,830
THE SON THEN TAKES PROACTIVE 

218
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,135
STEPS TO SELL THE STOCK. 

219
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:49,769
HIS FIANCC IMMEDIATELY LOGS 

220
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,703
ONTO HER BROKERAGE ACCOUNT AND 

221
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,172
THE NEXT MORNING AFTER HAVING 

222
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,506
THIS CONVERSATION, HE DUMPS THE 

223
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,209
STOCK. 

224
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,610
HE KEEPS ON LOADING AND 

225
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,713
UNLOADING IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING 

226
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,814
AND HE COUPLES THAT WAS 

227
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,516
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS FATHER 

228
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,384
AND WE KNOW THAT FROM THE PHONE 

229
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,320
LOGS. 

230
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,153
IN A CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 

231
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,423
CASE IT IS VERY STRONG.

232
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,926
>> YOU ARE CHRIS COLLINS 

233
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,326
DEFENSE ATTORNEY. 

234
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,429
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE?

235
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,530
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THE ELECTIONS 

236
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,734
ARE COMING UP IN NOVEMBER AND 

237
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,169
OCTOBER 11 IS A STATUS HEARING. 

238
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,704
I WILL TRY TO PROLONG ANY 

239
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:26,205
DISCOVERY. 

240
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,741
LET'S PUSH THIS PAST NOVEMBER 

241
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,142
AND HAVE A CLEAN PUBLIC IMAGE 

242
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,611
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. 

243
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,481
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE HELP. 

244
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,517
-- HELPED. 

245
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,886
IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT DOES THE 

246
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,289
PROSECUTION HAVE? 

247
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,323
TEXT MESSAGES? 

248
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,125
IT COULD BE THE STRONGEST 

249
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,426
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE CASE 

250
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,629
BUT I'VE SEEN CASES FALL APART. 

251
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,199
AT THE SAME POINT, WHEN YOU HAVE

252
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,903
THIS VERY STRONG TIMELINE AND 

253
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:58,704
THIS VERY SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR, 

254
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,106
I HAVE SEEN IT GO THE OTHER 

255
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:00,306
WAY. 

256
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,409
IT IS A TRICKY SCENARIO AND YOU 

257
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,977
MIGHT SEE A PLEA DEAL, IT LOOKS 

258
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,614
UNLIKELY.>> YOU SAY YOU'VE SEEN 

259
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,515
CASES LIKE THIS FALL APART. 

260
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,518
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? 

261
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,921
>> THE JURY WILL SAY AM I 

262
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:17,657
REALLY CAN FIND HIM GUILTY IF I 

263
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,190
DON'T HAVE THE ULTIMATE 

264
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,524
INFORMATION? 

265
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,992
MAYBE THE DEFENSE CAN RAISE 

266
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,293
ENOUGH REASONABLE DOUBT, 

267
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:23,629
BECAUSE REMEMBER, IT IS NOT 

268
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,133
JUST HAVING THE MATERIAL, BUT 

269
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,234
IT IS ACTING ON THAT 

270
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,235
INFORMATION AND TRADING ON IT. 

271
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,104
CAN THEY PRESENT ENOUGH DEFENSE 

272
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,305
TO SAY LOOK AT THE TRADING 

273
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:34,507
PATTERNS OF HIS SON AND HE 

274
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:41,614
TRADE LIKE THIS BEFORE? 

275
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,049
IT MIGHT BE A STRETCH WHAT WE 

276
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,216
SEE IN THE INDICTMENT, BUT THE 

277
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,885
DEFENSE HAS WORK TO DO.>> ARE 

278
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,919
THESE CODEFENDANTS THAT YOU 

279
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,822
BOTHER TRYING TO FLIP?

280
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,424
>> WHAT A FAMILY DYNAMIC THIS 

281
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:51,624
IS. 

282
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,725
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAMILY 

283
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,327
INDICTMENT THERE IS NUMEROUS 

284
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,663
AMOUNT OF UNINDICTED, NOT NAMED 

285
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,934
CO-CONSPIRATORS. 

286
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,369
THEY ARE CHRIS COLLINS SONS 

287
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:09,141
FIANCC, THE FIANCCS MOTHER AND 

288
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,209
THE BROTHER OF THE FIANCCS 

289
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:10,943
FATHER, THIS WHOLE FAMILY 

290
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,243
CONNECTION. 

291
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,312
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLICATED 

292
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,982
BUT THEY HAVE HAD TO PAY FINES 

293
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,150
BY THE SEC. 

294
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,518
IF YOU LOOK AT A TRIAL, ARE 

295
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,088
THEY GOING TO TESTIFY AGAINST 

296
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:22,922
THE COLLINS? 

297
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,156
THEY AREN'T MARRIED YET. 

298
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,727
SO THE SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE DOES 

299
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,529
NOT APPLY AT.

300
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,831
>> WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GET 

301
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,633
MARRIED BEFORE THE TRIAL?>> CAN 

302
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,167
SHE TESTIFY AGAINST HER 

303
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:35,433
HUSBAND? 

304
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,869
PROBABLY NOT. 

305
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,537
BUT ARE THEY HAVING 

306
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,106
CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW ABOUT 

307
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,141
SAVING YOURSELF AND YOU HAVE TO 

308
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,075
SAVE ME? 

309
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,345
HER FATHER HAS BEEN NAMED IN 

310
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,947
THIS INDICTMENT BUT THE WIFE 

311
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,016
AND HIS DAUGHTER HAVE NOT BEEN. 

312
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,518
IT IS A REALLY WEIRD SCENARIO. 

313
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,519
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN 

314
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,122
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.>> THEY 

315
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,890
MIGHT HAVE TO REPRINT THE SAVE 

316
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,026
THE DATE. 

317
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,330
HE TRIED TO PORTRAY THE STORY 

318
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,065
OF A GUY CARING ABOUT A 

319
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,133
TERRIBLE DISEASE. 

320
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:13,105
AS WE POINT OUT, HE DIDN'T SELL 

321
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,306
HIS SHARES, WHICH DOES NOT GO 

322
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,608
TO THE HEART OF THE CASE 

323
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:15,941
AGAINST HIM. 

324
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,877
DO YOU THINK THAT STORY THAT WE 

325
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,113
JUST HEARD, IS THAT SOMETHING 

326
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,747
YOU CAN SPIN IN FRONT OF A 

327
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:25,618
JURY?>> I THINK IT IS A GREAT 

328
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,886
AVENUE TO SPEND, ESPECIALLY IF 

329
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,688
HE GETS CONVICTED WHEN THE JURY 

330
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,322
HAS TO DECIDE. 

331
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,224
THEY WILL TAKE THE SOUNDBITE 

332
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,927
AND THEY WILL USE IT LATER ON. 

333
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,163
AND THERE IS NOT MUCH HE CAN DO 

334
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,331
RIGHT HERE. 

335
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,332
HE SAID I DON'T WANT TO 

336
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,534
LITIGATE THIS IN THE COURT OF 

337
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:41,934
PUBLIC OPINION. 

338
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:42,735
THAT IS VERY SMART. 

339
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,936
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S NOT MUCH 

340
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,504
MORE HE CAN SAY. 

341
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,941
DO I BELIEVE THAT HE BELIEVED 

342
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,743
IN THIS COMPANY AND HE WANTED 

343
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,712
IT TO WORK? 

344
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,313
ABSOLUTELY. 

345
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,714
BUT THAT WILL NOT HELP HIM FROM 

346
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,517
A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE.>> JESSE 

347
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,286
WEBER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 

348
00:12:00,286 --> 00:00:00,000
YOUR INSIGHTS.
