Welcome to Mars! 
All right. - Let's do it.
All right, let's get some 
Cheez-Its.
Guys we've got a good ship.
We've got a good crew.
We've got awesome mission
support.
What more could we ask for?
-We've got plenty of Cheez-Its.
Going outside is not an option,
at least not without a
spacesuit. So um-
feeling the wind rush
through your hair,
the warmth from the
sun on your skin
and the smell of wet grass or
even taste of freshly made snow
falling from the sky.
All those senses are
spectacular and so unique, and

more and more
in a way familiar and

Cleaning the toilets is an

We're getting to a point where
we're really kind of getting
more comfortable with living
with each other.

being able to step out 
of the world for a while.
I no longer feel like I'm
swimming in a ton of
negative news and distractions.
My whole world is basically
shrunken down to about 
six people.
