we all know that nepotism is questionable especially when it comes to the White House but Trump has been a big fan of nepotism he's put Ivanka Trump in the White House he's put Jared Kushner in the White House but just because someone's your family member doesn't necessarily mean that they're competent for the job and Jared Kushner has shown time and time again that he is not competent when it comes to taking over his own family's businesses primarily real estate issues so he made a really bad decision right before the housing and and economic collapse in 2008 so there was new reporting on that and I want to share it with you guys so according to Vanity Fair the most obvious example of Kushner's incompetence remains his decision to buy 666 Fifth Avenue on the eve of the financial crisis for what was then a record-setting 1.8 billion dollars putting down a mere 50 million in borrowing the rest the 1.2 billion loan of which Kushner family holds about half is due in February of 2019 just to give you an idea of how poorly this was done and how much he owes and how they're not bringing enough bringing in enough money to pay the loan let's do a little breakdown of the numbers so the midtown Manhattan office tower is on track to lose twenty four million dollars this year marking the worst performance for 666 Fifth Avenue since the 2011 refinancing the property had net operating income of eighteen point three million for the six months ending in June debt payments were thirty point four million during that period the towers cash flow is enough to cover only about half of the debt payments on the building down from sixty-six percent last year so every year it gets worse and yet there's nobody ok so there's lots of this story that I love so the apple doesn't fall far from the father-in-law Donald Trump also a study of incompetence in real estate and I know what the lower-right workers look what do you need to build you it's a billionaire he told me he has ten billion dollars let me see those tax returns and remember even in the best case scenario where he actually has like the three billion that he claims he originally claimed he had before he was running for president then all of a sudden moved it up to ten all right Eric if he had taken the money that he inherited from his dad even at the low end well like I think it was like 40 millions of low-end the high ends two hundred million he would and just put it in the stock market in the index fund it he would have more now than what he claims he has okay instead he bankrupted m6 itself six times his that actually was a smart real estate man by other accounts a terrible person okay Fred Trump the Donald Trump's dad but a smart businessman same thing with Kushner's dad he went to prison but by most accounts a smart businessman maybe - the prison part okay Jared comes in he's I don't worry daddy I got this I got this whew I'm gonna buy a real big shiny building in New York just like Donnie did okay and that's what Donald Trump did he would buy his dad built a fortune in Queens and he's like ARP Queens that's not sexy if I'm gonna go to Manhattan and buy some stuff in Manhattan and bankruptcy bankruptcy bankruptcy right anyway so Kushner goes and buys the most expensive building in New York because that's what bad businesspeople do they go buy shiny stuff and because they because they have to make up for their other issues inadequacies so like oh yeah New York daddy yeah but he's it gonna make money exactly who cares if it's the biggest one or the most expensive one smart businessmen create the shiny things all right I mean that's what entrepreneurs are they you know they come up with innovative ideas and they're the ones who build the shiny things I don't know anyway so he he's like oh I got it man Real Estate's going great okay it's 2007 he can't go down so he buys the most expensive building in New York right before the crash cuz he's convinced it won't go down oh my god idiot then he thinks he's clever because he only put 50 million dollar down now if their building is gonna go up that could be clever but you got to be really careful because if we don't put that much down the debt can kill you like any sensible business person would know that especially in real estate but he 50 million down oh okay but be careful Jared that might catch up with you later crash happens he has to give away about 50% of the state to vornado which is a a well known real estate company they come in the idiot okay for like a song because he had no choice otherwise they were gonna go completely bankrupt so verneda makes a smart move although now they're stuck in this building too but but probably that'll work out okay for them because they got it for almost nothing because they bailed him out so he's already given away half the farm right now it's the debts catching up to me it's like it's problem that's why he tried to if you remember the story we did earlier he tried to sell to the Chinese for four hundred million dollars more than it was worth by any other real estate standards like this real estate mark is not like hey a shoe is a hundred and three dollars at Foot Locker and a hamburger is a dollar ninety nine it's a little bit more variable than that it's whatever you can get for it right yes but but these are sophisticated investors and they're gonna do due diligence etc and when the Chinese are overpaying by four hundred and Jared Kushner is in charge of our relationship with China at the white house that seemed a little fishy and it was so fishy that the Chinese backed out they're like yeah this this looks really bad okay even for us this looks way too corrupt so and they're like I never mind never mind and they backed out and he's like oh no and that's the mess he's stuck in now and one last thing now related back to policy because remember jared is theoretically running that building and all other real estate stuff that he's involved in but he's also in charge of policy with China piece of the Middle East solving the opioid crisis the government's IT infrastructure what does he know about IT this is and my favorite quote reinventing the entire government that's the direct quote yeah that's what Jared Kushner is gonna do god help us all if we made a mistake if Anna made a mistake or I'm in a mistake in real estate or even jank made a mistake in real estate wouldn't happen it could be forgiven because we're not real estate people you know my dad wasn't a real estate mogul and I wasn't around real estate people to figure out the price per square foot and all the stuff that real estate people that-that jargon that they speak but the fact that this guy is steeped in real estate and has sold to us as this genius in real estate well here is in his genius space and he's doing the least genius e things that a person can do and then as Jake says I mean he's tasked with all these other things he is essentially king of the world you know we know where the president is he's on a golf course or he's hanging out watching Fox and Friends so Jared's kind of supposed to be doing a lot of this stuff and the truth is he is he's DOA as far as we as we know on on all these other issues look he's DOA on his genius space yeah yeah and remember so they said Jared's really smart you know he went to Harvard you remember the story about how his dad bought him his Harvard space they paid two million bucks to get both of his sons in and so that's a you know it's weird because we never have conversations about how that's not okay college campuses like we'll have these ridiculous nonsensical discussions about how minorities have the upper hand in college admissions which is not true but you know when it comes to that kind of stuff where Papa buys you admissions and to prestigious universities no one questions that the whole thing's a ruse man he's never been bright he's just like Donald Trump he had everything handed to him all he ever did was screw it up his dad the Donald Trump's dad got him out of Vietnam with her fake doctor's note about a problem with the heel the Trump can't remember which heel it was it's just gross and then he bragged about how his own personal Vietnam was avoiding STDs at the orgies he was going to a Jared Kushner gets handed his seat at Harvard and then I like I don't know if he particularly is against affirmative action but almost all the Republicans are and they're like God these black kids getting CY you million dollars to buy this seat okay and then he gets handed billions of dollars in transactions at least right yeah to put the 50 million in but and he screws that up royally now they're on the hook and it might bankrupt the entire family which would be awesome just while you're having please don't bankrupt the rest of us it's funny and fun when you bankrupt yourself okay but when you're trying to reinvent the entire government please find some professionals who can help you because you're not that bright if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could
