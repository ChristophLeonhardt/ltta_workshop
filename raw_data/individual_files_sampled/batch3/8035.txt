IN 1960. THERE IS NO COST TO THEM. THE COST IS ENTIRELY ON YOU, BUT DON'T COMPLAIN OR ELSE THEY CALL YOU HITLER. WE WANTED A CLOSER LOOK AT THE FACTS THE ON THE STORIES THAT WE SPOKE TO THE ACTING ICE DIRECTOR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. YOU'VE HEARD PROMINENT PEOPLE COMPARE YOUR BEHAVIOR TO THAT OF THE, , HOW DO YOU RESPOND? THEY ARE SIMPLY ENFORCING LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS. I WAS THERE WAS THIS MUCH OUTRAGE ABOUT SEPARATION OF FAMILIES. I WISH WE MET WITH MOTHERS AND FATHERS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. JEWISH CITIZEN CHILDREN THAT WERE KILLED AND SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILY FOREVER. I THINK PEOPLE ON THE HILL NEED TO STRAIGHTEN THEMSELVES OUT. LET'S PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS AS MUCH AS YOU ARE LOBBYING FOR THE LEGAL ALIEN. WE ARE ABOUT TO TALK TO ONE OF THOSE PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE KILLED. THE IMMEDIATE LAST FEW DAYS I HAVE BEEN INCENSED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY POLITICIANS. THEY SAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO USE THESE CHILDREN AS POLITICAL PONS. THEY ARE HAVING A SIDESHOW FOR THESE CHILDREN TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS CONGRESS TO FIX IT AND NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE UNDERLYING REASON FOR THE WHOLE ARGUMENT. ARE THESE FAMILIES ESCAPING FEAR AND PERSECUTION? OVER 80% OF THESE CLAIMS ARE FRIVOLOUS.

THEY ARE CHOOSING TO ENTER BETWEEN THE PORTS OF ENTRY AND THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE SEPARATED BUT THEY WANT TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO DO THAT. SO LET'S PUT THE BLAME ON WHO ADVISED.

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DO WHAT WE ARE HEARING WE MUST DO, WHICH IS GIVING IMMEDIATELY AUTOMATIC AMNESTY WITH ANYONE CROSSING ILLEGALLY WITH A MINOR CHILD IN TOW? THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN DONE. LET ME TELL YOU THE WAY IT WORKS RIGHT NOW. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, IF A FAMILY COMES IN OUR CUSTODY, WE CAN HOLD THEM FOR LESS THAN 20 DAYS AND RELEASE THEM. MOST OF THEM END UP IN IMMIGRATION COURT. IMMIGRATION COURT ORDERED 40,000 AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE LAW SO WE CAN KEEP THESE PEOPLE DETAINED AND, BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE FINAL DECISION DOESN'T MEAN WE FORGET ABOUT IT. LAST YEAR WHEN WE WENT AND LOOKED FOR THESE FAMILIES, I GOT HUNDREDS OF LETTERS SAYING, HOW DARE YOU PUT YOUR FINITE RESOURCES FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE DECISION,
