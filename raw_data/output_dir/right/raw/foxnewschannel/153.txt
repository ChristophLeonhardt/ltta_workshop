1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:01,934

00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,240
COAST.

7
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,975
SHE IS ONE OF THE HOSTS FROM

8
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,944
THE UPCOMING FOX NATION.

9
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,512
TOMI, WHAT IS FORMER SPEAKER

10
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,080
PELOSI TALKING ABOUT WITH

11
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,148
THE IT'S A MANHOOD ISSUE?

12
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,783
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I

13
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,585

14
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,820
PELOSI IS ALSO THE SAME

15
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,788
WOMAN THAT TOLD US THAT

16
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,923
SOMETIMES MOWING THE GRASS

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,491
NEAR THE BORDER IS A MORE

18
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,425
EFFECTIVE OPTION THAN A

19
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,827
BORDER WALL SO LET'S START

20
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,494
THERE.

21
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:33,365
BUT, FURTHERMORE, A BORDER

22
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,336
WALL IS NOT A MANHOOD ISSUE

23
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,904
IT'S AN AMERICAN ISSUE.

24
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,372
I WILL REMIND YOU MILLIONS

25
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,440
OF AMERICAN WOMEN WHO VOTED

26
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,274
FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BUILD

27
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,709
THAT WALL AND WE CERTAINLY

28
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,012
DON'T HAVE A MANHOOD ISSUE.

29
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,581
STEVE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

30
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,449
THIS CARAVAN COMING TOWARD

31
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,016
THE UNITED STATES?

32
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,152
I THINK IT'S CURRENTLY IN

33
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,187
HONDURAS AND THE PRESIDENT

34
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,023
YESTERDAY SAID HEY,

35
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,861
HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, HE WILL EL

36
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:02,228
SALVADOR.

37
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,429
IF YOU DON'T STOP YOUR

38
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,563
PEOPLE FROM COMING HERE WE

39
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:05,497
WILL CUT OFF THE CASH.

40
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,632
>> IS HE EXACTLY RIGHT AND

41
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,867
WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO

42
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,201
SECURE OUR BORDER.

43
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,736
IF OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOT

44
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,238
GOING TO COOPERATE TO HELP

45
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,206
SECURE OUR BORDER AND THEIR

46
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,608
OWN WE HAVE TO RESORT TO

47
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,909
THAT WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF

48
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,477
WE HAD A BIG FAT BORDER WALL

49
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,678
THERE SO WHEN THIS CARAVAN

50
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:20,846
CAME TO OUR BORDER WE

51
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:21,881
WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

52
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,482
THIS ISSUE?

53
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,850
BOY, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT

54
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,585
TO HAPPEN.

55
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,319
AINSLEY: TOMI, THERE WAS A

56
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,254
HEADLINE IN BUZZFEED AND

57
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,022
THIS IS WHAT IT READS.

58
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:30,923
SUBURBAN WOMEN ARE FED UP

59
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,857
WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

60
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,792
AND COULD DRIVE A BLUE WAVE.

61
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:34,927
ARE THEY UNDER ESTIMATING

62
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,563
THE POWER OF WOMEN LIKE YOU

63
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,430
THE REPUBLICAN BASE?

64
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,999
>> WELL, THEY ALSO TOLD US

65
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
THAT HILLARY HAD A 93%

66
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,302
CHANCE OF WINNING AND I

67
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:47,373
REMIND THEM THAT HILLARY IS

68
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,641
NOT YOUR PRESIDENT AND NOT

69
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,376
MY PRESIDENT EITHER.

70
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,710
THEY UNDERESTIMATE THE

71
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,012
WHISPER VOTER.

72
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,113
THE VOTERS WHO DON'T GO OUT

73
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,215
IN THE STREET AND MARCH WITH

74
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,816
PINK HATS AND VOTING SIGNS.

75
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,418
WE DO MARCH INTO THE VOTING

76
00:01:59,419 --> 00:01:59,718
BOOTH.

77
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,553
LIKE THEY THOUGHT IN

78
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,254
NOVEMBER OF 2016 GOING TO

79
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,389
HAVE SURGE OF WOMEN VOTING

80
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,456
FOR HILLARY AND DEMOCRATS,

81
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,491
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

82
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,725
ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE GOING TO

83
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,193
VOTE WITH OUR POCKETBOOK.

84
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:09,260
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR

85
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,162
NATIONAL SECURITY, BORDER

86
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:10,529
SECURITY.

87
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,764
AND WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR

88
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,698
OUR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES

89
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,333
WHO ARE GOING TO SECURE

90
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:14,700
THAT.

91
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,401
BRIAN: HILLARY GOT THE

92
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,303
FEMALE VOTE, PRESIDENT TRUMP

93
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,872
GOT 53% OF THE WHITE FEMALE

94
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,205
VOTE.

95
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,041
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS WILL

96
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,943
BE ANOTHER CHANCE FOR BOTH

97
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,411
GENDERS TO WEIGH IN

98
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,145
HYPOTHETICALLY, WE ASSUME

99
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,079
THEY WILL.

100
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,316
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT

101
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:30,983
SAID ABOUT IT?

102
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,319
>> I HAD WORSE POLL NUMBERS

103
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,987
WHEN I WENT INTO THE LAST

104
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,988
ELECTION AND YOU SAW HOW

105
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,956
WELL DID I WITH WOMEN.

106
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,424
IF YOU LOOKED AT MY POLL

107
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,925
NUMBERS GOING INTO 2016, YOU

108
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,260
WOULD HAVE SAID THERE IS NOT

109
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,528
A WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY

110
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,929
THAT'S GOING TO VOTE FOR ME,

111
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,864
AND I DID PHENOMENAL WITH

112
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:46,799
WOMEN.

113
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,334
THEY WANT SECURITY AND THEY

114
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,368
WANT FINANCIAL SECURITY,

115
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,870
TOO.

116
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,441
BRIAN: TOMI, HE FEELS

117
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,342
OPTIMISTIC THE POLLS ARE

118
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,209
JUST WRONG.

119
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,611
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN POLLS

120
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,411
SINCE THE LAST ELECTION

121
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,980
EITHER BECAUSE, AGAIN, A LOT

122
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,481
OF THE THINGS THAT WOMEN OR

123
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,450
MEN, FOR THAT MATTER, SAY TO

124
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,851
POLSTERS THAT THEY SAY WHEN

125
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,019
THEY ARE TAKING ANY TYPE OF

126
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,587
A SURVEY IS NOT WHAT THEY

127
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,289
ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IN

128
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:10,756
THEIR VOTE.

129
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,893
IN THIS COUNTRY TRUMP

130
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,229
SUPPORTERS AND REPUBLICAN

131
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,263
SUPPORTERS SHAMED INTO

132
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,965
SAYING WHO THEY ARE GOING TO

133
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:20,299
SUPPORT.

134
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,867
AGAIN WHEN THEY GOAT IN

135
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,369
VOTING BOOTH BY THEMSELVES

136
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,137
THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR

137
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,138
CONSCIOUS AND AMERICA FIRST

138
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,439
AND CANDIDATES WHO WILL MAKE

139
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,707
SURE THAT HAPPENS.

140
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,541
BRIAN: DO YOU THINK IT'S

141
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,844
PROBLEMATIC FOR MORE THAN

142
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,278
JUST STORMY DANIELS WHEN THE

143
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,315
PRESIDENT TWEETS OUT HORSE

144
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:36,615

145
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:36,982
[LAUGHTER]

146
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,617
>> AGAIN, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE

147
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,718
THE PRESIDENT'S STYLE IF IS

148
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,886
HE EFFECTIVE ECONOMICALLY

149
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,321
AND BUILD US THAT BORDER

150
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,189
WALL I CAN REALLY CARE LESS

151
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,793
WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT STORMY

152
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,193
DANIELS.
