let's let's talk to Al Jazeera's senior political analyst um I want Bashara who's joining us here and just on that very mention that Hera was talking about there Marwin about the fact that the first thing you mentioned was celebrating the move of the embassy to Jerusalem the fact that he didn't reach out for any kind of dialogue with the Palestinians doesn't bode well that this new Secretary of State is going to bring future harmony to the particular region absolutely and especially as diplomats and really this is the the ultimate definition of a diplomat they'd be able to handle things that everyone is preoccupied with the fact that the Washington Post reports that more than 2200 young Palestinians are injured and the fact that there are dozens of dead killed by Israelis on the very vicinity where the Secretary of State is and for him not even to address it as if the Palestinians are the ultimate present absent ease in this equation at the same time he's listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu speak of how the common values of the United States and Israel is freedom and democracy certainly the Palestinians will not agree with this the fact that they are incarcerated occupied repressed and shot and killed certainly does not bode well with diplomacy and with all that's going on in the Middle East at the moment all the talk is about Iran every sort of decision to go and to talk to the various leaders in the Middle East that Mike Pompeo as made in the last two days is focused on Iran why is it suddenly this is the main focus to the detriment of everything else you know whenever any new administration comes in they tend to focus on one major overarching global topic or enemy or axis of sort in the region for the Trump administration it's Iran and hence everything else all the ducks will have to line up for that very particular axis which is the United States versus Iran good-versus-evil democracy against Islamic fundamentalism the forces of stability and peace against the forces of violence and instability and so forth and so Saudi Arabia's of course is an enthusiastic partner in this partnership against Iran Israel is an enthusiastic partner Turkey is not so enthusiastic and that's why the first trip of course was with Turkey and then you have a whole bunch of other potential partners that are hesitant like Jordan like Qatar like Egypt and so on so forth where I think the United need the United States needs to bring together in this axis and as I said this is not of course at first you know in 58 the United States asked everyone in the region to say against or for Nasser of Egypt in 68 was against or for terrorism and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 70s that was home a knee in 88 it was Saddam 98 it was Bin Ladin and so on so forth always naming a demon and asking everyone to be with the United States or against it just briefly the last something closer to home I suppose is this this message that he took to the Saudis that the the blockade with Qatar has to end how do you think the Saudis are all reacting to that I think ultimately they're going to have to respond as I keep saying over the last year you know it's very hard to climb down a tree and when you're on the Gulf it's very hard to climb down a palm tree but be that as it may I think the Saudis kind of shyly timidly had been sort of trying to do something about that not so much so the United Arab Emirates and Egypt but ultimately they can have to do something it will not go back to what it was before June 2017 it probably might be a cold piece of sort a sort of normalization of minimum sorts of relations but the warmth that we've seen before I think we're not gonna see again because the problem with all of that sue is that Saudi Arabia and remember extended not only to be an intergovernmental confrontation or clash or a problem they turned it into a people to a people and I think that's gonna take time to heal now I know it's good to get your thoughts thanks very much
