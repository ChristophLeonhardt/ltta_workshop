1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:02,020
AND A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES WERE

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,387
INVOLVED.

3
00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:03,955
HE ALSO SAID THIS DOES NOT ANY

4
00:00:03,955 --> 00:00:06,691
WAY IMPUGN THE INTEGRITY OF THE

5
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:09,928
FBI AND ITS WORKFORCE, BRET.

6
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:10,729
>> Bret: LET'S GET REACTION

7
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:12,197
FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF TWO MAJOR

8
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:14,032
HOUSE COMMITTEE IS LOOKING INTO

9
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:14,432
ALL OF THIS.

10
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,935
TREY GOWDY IS CHAIRMAN OF THE

11
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:20,138

00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:20,739
REFORM COMMITTEE AND BOB

JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

15
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,743
CHAIRMAN GAUDI, FIRST TO YOU.

16
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:27,379
JUST OF BROAD OVERVIEW, WHAT

17
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:29,648
STRIKES YOU ABOUT THIS REPORT?

18
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:32,717
>> WHAT A DARK DAY IT IS FOR THE

19
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,786
FBI AND DOJ, TWO INSTITUTIONS OF

20
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:35,620
OUR COUNTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS

21
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,155
AND WE DESPERATELY HAVE TO HAVE

22
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:38,757
CONFIDENCE IN THEM.

23
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:40,892
IN THIS LEVEL OF BIAS AND

24
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:41,626
ANIMUS, NOT ONLY DID THEY WANT

25
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,562
TO STOP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BUT

26
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:46,631
HE WANTED TO STOP THE TRUMP

27
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:47,299
PRESIDENT.

28
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:50,302
PETER STRZOK, THE FBI AGENT THAT

29
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:51,336
WAS ON ELDER CLINTON'S

30
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:52,337
INVESTIGATION AND ARGUABLY AT

31
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:53,738
THE LEAD RUSSIA INVESTIGATOR NOT

32
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,540
ONLY WANTED TO STOP HIS

33
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,843
CAMPAIGN, BUT ONCE HE WANTED,

34
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,745
GOT ON THE MUELLER PRO BECAUSE

35
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,847
HE WANTED TO IMPEACH HIM.

36
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,616
THAT'S A LEVEL OF ANIMUS AND

37
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:08,119
BIAS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD

38
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:08,587
REJECT.

39
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:09,554
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

40
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:12,257
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THAT YOUR

41
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:13,024
FELLOW CITIZENS QUESTION WHETHER

42
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:15,894
OR NOT THEY CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE

43
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:16,828
IN THE WORLD'S PREMIER

44
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:17,596
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND

45
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:19,931
THAT'S COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO

46
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,066
HAS DEFENDING           DEFENDED

47
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:21,099

48
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:21,132
HAS DEFENDING           DEFENDEE

49
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:21,299
HAS DEFENDING           DEFENDEM

50
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:21,900

HAS DEFENDING           DEFENDES

57
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:25,203
CAREER.

58
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:26,638
THIS WAS A BITTERLY

59
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:27,205
DISAPPOINTING REPORT.

60
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:28,340
>> FIRST OF ALL, THIS REPORT

61
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,141
SHOWS THAT THERE WAS SPECIAL

62
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:31,743
TREATMENT GIVEN TO

63
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:32,310
HILLARY CLINTON IN THE

64
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,944
INVESTIGATION OF HER CASE.

65
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:36,915
THERE IS NOT A STANDARD

66
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:37,482
PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN

67
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:39,184
INVESTIGATING HER, AND THERE WAS

68
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:40,118
SPECIAL TREATMENT GIVEN.

69
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:42,721
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS WAS

70
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,955
NOT A PROPER PROCESS AND OF THE

71
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:46,591
REPORT SHOWS TIME AND TIME AGAIN

72
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,127
HOW DIRECTOR COMEY AND OTHERS

73
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:51,329
MADE MISTAKES, ERRORS IN

74
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,764
JUDGMENT, OR DELIBERATE.

75
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:53,898
PEOPLE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN

76
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:54,299
CONCLUSIONS.

77
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,736
BUT IT WAS ON IMPROPERLY

78
00:01:57,736 --> 00:01:58,336
HANDLED.

79
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:59,170
AND AS TREY SAID TO COME AND YOU

80
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,140
CAN UP AGAINST OUT THE

81
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,642
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN HANDLED

82
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:05,644
IN THE SO-CALLED TRUMP-RUSSIA

83
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:06,911
COLLUSION, AND YOU HAVE CONTRAST

84
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,947
THAT IS SHOCKING IN TERMS OF HOW

85
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:10,148
THEY HANDLED ONE PRESIDENTIAL

86
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:12,550
CAMPAIGN COMPARED TO ANOTHER.

87
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,919
IT'S GOT TO BE INVESTIGATED

88
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,687
FURTHER, CHANGES HAVE TO BE

89
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:15,987
MADE.

90
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:18,123
I WILL COMPLEMENT DIRECTOR RAY

91
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,991
ON SOME OF THE PERSONNEL CHANGES

92
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:22,527
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, THERE ARE

93
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:23,428
SOME SOBERING LESSONS LEARNED

94
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:24,796
FROM THIS.

95
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:25,930
WE NEED TO SEE CHANGES MADE SO

96
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,266
THAT IN 2,020 WE DON'T SEE

97
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,734
ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

98
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:30,502
HANDLED LIKE THIS.

99
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:31,903
>> Bret: SO WHEN YOU HEAR

100
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,038
REPUBLICANS AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE

101
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:35,840
BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS AND SAY,

102
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,144
THIS 568 PAGES, THERE IS JUST

103
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:41,479
NOT A LOT THEY ARE, OR THAT

104
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,882
HOROWITZ LEFT SOMETHING ON THE

105
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:45,250
TABLE, HOW DO YOU RESPOND?

106
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,719
>> THIS IS A VERY THOROUGH

107
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,753
INVESTIGATION.

108
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,055
HE TAKES MINUTIA AND EXAMINES

109
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:53,391
EACH PIECE CAREFULLY, DRAWS HIS

110
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,193
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND

111
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:55,226
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND     C

112
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:55,260
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND     M

113
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,293
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND     E

114
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:55,527
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND     D

00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:55,560
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND     H

116
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:55,593
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND     M

117
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:55,827
CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND     .

118
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,962
I THINK IT'S A WELL-DONE REPORT.

119
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:59,364
I NEVER EXPECTED HIM TO FIND A

120
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:00,365
RECYCLE THING AS SOME CRITICS

121
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:04,703
HAVE SAID BUT HE DID FIND ALL

122
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,705
WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE

123
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:08,707
STRZOK PAGE TEXT, INCLUDING THIS

124
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:10,175
NEW ONE THAT HAS COME OUT

125
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:12,410
RECENTLY WHERE PART OF IT ROSE

126
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,113
REDACTED, AND BY THE WAY WE ONLY

127
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,915
GOT PART OF THE SENTENCE WHERE

128
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:19,117
HE WAS GOING TO STOP

129
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,318
DONALD TRUMP OF THE

130
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:20,752
UNITED STATES.

131
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:23,688
THAT'S IMPROPER FOR THE FBI.

132
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:25,757
PRIMARILY THAT WAS THE PREMIER

133
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:26,725
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND

134
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:27,692
BESMIRCHING OF TENS OF THOUSANDS

135
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:29,594
OF BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO KEEP

136
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:30,695
US SAFE, PREVENT TERRORIST

137
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,997
ATTACKS AND FIGHT CRIME EVERY

138
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:33,398
SINGLE DAY.

139
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:36,735
I HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IN THE

140
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:38,536
HIERARCHY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

141
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:39,504
HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE.

142
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,607
>> Bret: LET'S PUT UP THE

143
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:43,441
AUGUST 8, 2016, WHICH IS THE ONE

144
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:45,410
WHERE PAGE SAYS TRUMP IS NEVER

145
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,914
GOING TO BE PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

146
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:50,749
RIGHT.

147
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:51,783
AND THAT PART WAS REDACTED.

148
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:55,320
HERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT WE

149
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,156
BELIEVE.

150
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,558
NOVEMBER 22ND, 2016, FBI

151
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:01,226
ATTORNEY ONE, ISN'T MAKING

152
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:02,427
RETHINK YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE

153
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:03,561
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?

154
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:07,232
I THINK THAT'S A LISA PAGE.

155
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:08,900
ATTORNEY TWO, NO, VIVA LA

156
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,301
RESISTANCE.

157
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,270
AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S PETER

158
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,940
STRZOK.

159
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,510
LET ME SAY THIS, JIM COMEY, IN

160
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,012
HIS INTERVIEW HERE AT SPECIAL

161
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,349
REPORT, I ASKED ABOUT THE

162
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:24,849
STRZOK-PAGE TEXT.

163
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,485
AND IF HE KNEW NOW WHAT HE KNEW

164
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,486
THEN, WHAT HE WOULD DO.

165
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:32,290
>> I WOULD HAVE REMOVED BOTH OF

166
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,892
THEM FROM ANY CONTACT WITH

167
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:36,594
SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATIONS,

168
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:37,562
INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING

169
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:39,564
ANYBODY CONNECTED TO

170
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:40,265
PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT BEYOND

171
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,367
THAT.

172
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:55,780
>> Bret: SO YOU'D RATHER THE

173
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,514
WORK PRODUCT THEN BE QUESTIONED?

174
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:56,848
>> SURE.

175
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:57,515
>> Bret: THIS DEALS WITH THE

176
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:58,216
BLEACH BIT AND OF THE SERVER,

177
00:04:58,216 --> 00:04:58,817
SHERYL MILLS AND THAT.

178
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,618
INTERVIEWS MICHAEL FLYNN AND HIS

179
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:01,553
INTRO: THIS ENTIRE CASE.

180
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:03,521
>> BUT HE'S ONE OF MANY OTHER

181
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,923
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ALL THE

182
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:05,957
THINGS YOU TICKED OFF.

183
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,959
WHEN I SAW THE TAX, I WAS DEEPLY

184
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,361
DISAPPOINTED IN THEM BUT I NEVER

185
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,697
SAW ANY BIAS.

186
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:13,431
>> Bret: ANY BIAS.

187
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:15,934
>> WHILE HE'S NOT READING THE

188
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,902
SAME TEXTS THAT I AM READING.

189
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,437
PETER STRZOK SAID THE VOTE

190
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:22,040
SHOULD BE 100 MILLION TO ZERO.

191
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,409
HE CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE

192
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,743
SOLITARY AMERICAN THAT WOULD

193
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,779
WANT DONALD TRUMP TO BE

194
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:28,146
PRESIDENT.

195
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:32,350
HE SAID HE WILL STOP IT.

196
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,284
ACTUALLY, DIRECTOR COMEY

197
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:34,485
UNWITTINGLY JUST PROVE THE POINT

198
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:36,020
OF THE QUESTION YOU ASKED HIM ON

199
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,387
FOLLOW-UP.

200
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,122
WOULD YOU HAVE KEPT HIM ON

201
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,023
INVESTIGATION HOW DO YOU KNOW

202
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:41,159
WHAT YOU KNOW NOW?

203
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,594
AND HE SAID NO.

204
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:44,562
BECAUSE BIAS IS NOT INSIDIOUS,

205
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:45,830
IT'S THAT PERVASIVE AND IT

206
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,764
COLORS YOUR ABILITY TO DO WHAT

207
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:50,168
WE NEED THE FBI TO DO, WHICH IS

208
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:50,768
TO BE FAIR.

209
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,437
SO OF COURSE, YOU WILL FIRE HIM

210
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:53,805
THE DAY YOU LEARN.

211
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:55,607
IN MY HEAD, I GO BACK.

212
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,575
WHEN DID YOU START WORKING ON

213
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:57,942
THE CASE?

214
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,077
THAT'S WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN

215
00:05:59,077 --> 00:05:59,377
FIRED.

216
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:02,580
SO WHATEVER HE DID ON EITHER OF

217
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,148
THESE INVESTIGATIONS, BRET, IT

218
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:05,516
HAS TO BE VIEWED THROUGH THE

219
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:07,085
PRISM THAT HE CAN'T THINK OF A

220
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,319
SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON THAT

221
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,023
SHOULD VOTE FOR THIS MAN TO BE

222
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:12,423
PRESIDENT.

223
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:15,493
>> Bret: SO STRZOK'S ATTORNEY

224
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:17,262
SAYS THIS WAS TAKEN OUT OF

225
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,162
CONTEXT.

226
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,464
DID THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT

227
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,999
THE RUSSIA INFORMATION, AND

228
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,267
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE REFERRING

229
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:22,767
TO?

230
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,036
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS CHANGES

231
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,338
AT ALL IN CONTEXT, FOR IN A

232
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,976
VACUUM, IT IS IT JUST?

233
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,144
>> IT CHANGES A LOT GOING

234
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,913
FORWARD.

235
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,781
RUSSIA DID SOMETHING TO OUR

236
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:37,949
COUNTRY IN 2016.

237
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,550
IT WAS SERIOUS, IT DESERVED TO

238
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,152
BE INVESTIGATED AND IT DESERVED

239
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,755
TO BE INVESTIGATED BY A FAIR FBI

240
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:45,556
AGENT WHO WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT

241
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:46,257
IMPEACHING THE PERSON THAT HE

242
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:49,961
WAS INVESTIGATING.

243
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:51,262
HIS LAWYER IS JUST WRONG, THAT

244
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,331
BY A STATE IMPACT SOMETHING.

245
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,567
HE WAS SO HYPER FOCUSED ON TRUMP

246
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,771
THAT HE IGNORED AT THE-ABERDEEN

247
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:00,939
EMAIL AND CAUSED JAMES COMEY TO

248
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,540
SEND A LETTER ONE MONTH LATER

249
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,741
THAN HE SHOULD HAVE SENT IT.

250
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:09,714
WHY IS IT OUR JOB TO PROVE THAT

251
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:10,949
STRZOK'S IS BIASED IN HIS

252
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:11,416
DECISION-MAKING?

253
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,250
YOU COME BEFORE THE AMERICAN

254
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,720
PUBLIC AND PROVE TO US THAT YOU

255
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,221
ARE MANIFEST ANIMUS TOWARDS

256
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:18,222
DONALD TRUMP DID NOT AFFECT YOUR

257
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:18,589
DECISION.

258
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,025
>> Bret: LET ME ASK ONE MORE

259
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:21,392
QUESTION.

260
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:23,528
>> BECAUSE TREY IS EXACTLY

261
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,330
RIGHT, WE HAVE BEEN REQUESTING

262
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,765
THAT HE BE PRODUCED AS A WITNESS

263
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:28,800
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

264
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,234
IF THAT AGREEMENT IS NOT REACHED

265
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,370
WE WILL SHORTLY ISSUE A SUBPOENA

266
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,571
FOR HIM TO APPEAR.

267
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,573
>> Bret: SPEAKING OF THAT,

268
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:36,274
THERE ARE ALSO DOCUMENTS THAT

269
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:40,078
YOU WANT THAT YOU STILL HAVEN'T

270
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:40,445
RECEIVED.

271
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,480
>> WE ARE SETTING UP A BETTER

272
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,781
PROCESS AND WE ARE MAKING

273
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:44,148
PROGRESS.

274
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:45,149
WE HAVE A ROOM AT THE DEPARTMENT

275
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,684
OF JUSTICE WHERE THEY ARE

276
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:47,986
PRODUCING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

277
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:57,462
DOCUMENTS AND ARE INVESTIGATORS

278
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:57,996
ARE PRODUCING THOSE.

279
00:07:57,996 --> 00:07:58,696
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS IN THAT

280
00:07:58,696 --> 00:07:59,397
REGARD, BUT WE ALSO HAVE OTHER

281
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,164
DOCUMENTS THEY HAVE NOT PRODUCED

282
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:01,199
AND THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS

283
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,733
ON.

284
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:02,667
WE HAVE MEETINGS COMING UP

285
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,268
SHORTLY ON HOW TO GET THOSE

286
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,505
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED,

287
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:07,939
PRODUCED.

288
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,307
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT

289
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:10,341
TO KNOW.

290
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,343
AT THE CONGRESS IS IN THEIR

291
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:13,144
REPRESENTATIVE AND THE DOCUMENTS

292
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,112
HAVE TO BE PRODUCED.

293
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,547
THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO

294
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:16,981
PRODUCE THEM.

295
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,149
>> Bret: CHAIRMAN GAUDI, THE

296
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,684
LAST TIME YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

297
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:22,286
FBI INNER WORKINGS, IT WAS ABOUT

298
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,355
THIS ALLEGATION OF SPYGATE.

299
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:27,258
YOU SAID AT THE TIME, YOU

300
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:28,426
THOUGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT AND

301
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:29,927
OTHERS THOUGHT THE FBI WAS DOING

302
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,963
WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

303
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:32,263
DOING.

304
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,798
IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS, AND YOU

305
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,600
ARE ANIMATED ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE

306
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,404
LEARNING ABOUT THIS IG REPORT.

307
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,105
ABOUT HOW THIS IS ALL PROGRESS

308
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:44,776
EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE RUSSIA

309
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:45,343
INVESTIGATION?

310
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:48,046
>> BRET, I'M ANIMATED BECAUSE

311
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:50,381
RUSSIA TRIED TO DENY OUR

312
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:51,749
FUNDAMENTALS OF 2016.

313
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:53,384
AND I HEARD WHAT ANY

314
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:55,153
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HEARD IN

315
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:56,621
2016, EVERY ONE OF MY FELLOW

316
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,189
CITIZENS WOULD SAY, YOU GO FIND

317
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:00,224
OUT WHETHER THAT IS TRUE OR NOT.

318
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:02,060
YOU WILL FIND OUT WHETHER A

319
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,194
FOREIGNER, A HOSTILE COUNTRY IS

320
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,763
GOING TO MESS WITH OUR ELECTION.

321
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:06,998
WHAT OUR FELLOW CITIZENS ALSO

322
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:08,266
EXPECT IS FOR THE AGENT THAT

323
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,568
DOES A FOLLOW-UP TO BE FREE OF

324
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:13,905
TAINT AND BIAS.

325
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:15,807
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE ONE

326
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:18,142
PICKED TO FOLLOW UP AND LEAVE

327
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,210
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION HAS

328
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,578
MANIFEST ANIMUS AND CAN THINK OF

329
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,814
A SINGLE PERSON TO VOTE

330
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,115
DONALD TRUMP.

331
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,551
SO THOSE TWO ARE INEXTRICABLY

332
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,385
INTERTWINED.

333
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,419
MOST OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS WOULD

334
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:30,221
SAY, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT RUSSIA

335
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,623
WAS DOING TO US IN 2016 BUT I

336
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,225
ALSO WANT THE PERSON THAT IS

337
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,760
FINDING OUT AND INVESTIGATING IT

338
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,963
TO BE FREE OF BIAS AND FREE OF

339
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:39,263
TAINT.

340
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:45,403
>> Bret: AND THEY WOULD SAY,

341
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:46,637
MUELLER, FIRE THAT GUY.

342
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:48,773
>> AND HE DID FIRE HIM.

343
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,741
THAT'S WHAT'S SO PERVASIVE ABOUT

344
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:52,743
BIAS, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

345
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:53,744
MUELLER COMES UP WITH.

346
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:58,716
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE

347
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:04,956
THAT STRZOK'S LEVEL OF ANIMUS

348
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:06,557
WAS SO HIGH -- >> Bret: THIS

349
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:07,758
IS WHAT YOU HEAR.

350
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:10,027
THEY HEAR US REPORTING ON THESE

351
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,163
568 PAGES AND THEY HAVE BEEN

352
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:13,965
WAITING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS.

353
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:17,268
AND THEY HEAR WHAT IS COMING OUT

354
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,369
OF IT.

355
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,071
WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR

356
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:23,207
SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE WRONG IN

357
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,343
THEIR MIND.

358
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:26,144
AND INVESTIGATION AFTER

359
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:27,145
INVESTIGATION, IT SEEMS LIKE IT

360
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:30,448
COMES TO A HEAD AND THEN NOTHING

361
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:31,582
HAPPENS.

362
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:32,016
>> ABSOLUTELY.

363
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:37,355
HUNDREDS OF CLASSIFIED EMAILS,

364
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:37,989
OR HANDLED IMPROPERLY IN

365
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,891
VIOLATION OF THE LAW, AND NO ONE

366
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,826
HAS BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN

367
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:42,360
THAT REGARD.

368
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,264
NOW WE SEE THAT THE WHOLE

369
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:46,964
PROCESS OF THAT INVESTIGATION

370
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:48,633
WAS HANDLED WITH EXTREME BIAS

371
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,768
AND A WHOLE HOST OF QUESTIONABLE

372
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,703
ACTIONS, AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE

373
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:53,204
HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

374
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,872
SOME PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER

375
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:57,275
EMPLOYED AT THE FEDERAL BUREAU

376
00:10:57,275 --> 00:10:58,609
OF INVESTIGATION AND THE

377
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:04,348
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

378
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:05,449
WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE SO

379
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,317
THESE THINGS DON'T OCCUR IN THE

380
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,953
FUTURE AND WE DON'T HAVE A 2,020

381
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,088
THAT LOOKS ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE

382
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,224
IT DOES IN TERMS OF THIS KIND OF

383
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,559
MISHANDLING OF INVESTIGATIONS OF

384
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,960
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE,

385
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,696
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

386
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:19,897
TWO CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT OF

387
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:20,498
THE UNITED STATES.

388
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,667
SO TREY AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE

389
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,368
A JOINT HEARING NEXT TUESDAY

390
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:25,169
WHERE WE WILL HAVE THE

391
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,571
INSPECTOR GENERAL AND BE ABLE TO

392
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:31,809
GO INTO THIS 560 PAGE REPORT AND

393
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:32,376
ASK QUESTIONS.

394
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:34,345
THE FOLLOWING WEEK, WE HAVE

395
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,147
ALREADY REQUESTED THE DEPUTY

396
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:36,981
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

397
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:39,350
UNITED STATES, MR. ROSENSTEIN,

398
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,351
AND THE FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER

399
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,786
WRAY TO COME FORWARD AND TALK TO

400
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,154
US AND ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS

401
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:44,355
BASED ON THAT REPORT.

402
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,424
>> Bret: OTHER QUICK NUGGETS

403
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:47,959
HERE, IN THIS REPORT IT SAYS

404
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:48,926
DEFINITIVELY THAT HILLARY

405
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:50,962
CLINTON'S EMAILS WERE HACKED BY

406
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:51,896
FOREIGN ACTORS OF SOME KIND.

407
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:55,866
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S

408
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:59,337
IMPORTANT.

409
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:02,907
>> WE GOT A LITTLE WINDOW INTO

410
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:04,542
THAT WHEN ONE OF JIM COMEY'S

411
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,443
ORIGINAL MEMO DRAFTS HAD THAT

412
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:07,211
LANGUAGE IN THERE AND IT WAS

413
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,346
EDITED OUT.

414
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,147
THERE ARE TWO REASONS THEY CITE

415
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,315
FOR NOT PROSECUTING

416
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,183
HILLARY CLINTON.

417
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:13,751
NUMBER ONE, SHE DIDN'T HAVE

418
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,585
SPECIFIC GENERAL INTENT AND

419
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:17,188
NUMBER TWO SHE DIDN'T EXPOSE IT

420
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,824
TO FOREIGN ACTORS.

421
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:20,625
AND ONE OF THOSE REASONS IS

422
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,158
BOGUS.

423
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,194
HAVE THEY DONE A GOOD JOB OF

424
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:25,196
INTERVIEWING HER, HAD THEY NOT

425
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:26,797
MADE UP THEIR MIND SIX WEEKS

426
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,399
BEFORE THEY WENT TO INTERVIEW

427
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,401
HER, PERHAPS I COULD HAVE FOUND

428
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,802
EVIDENCE OF INTENT TO COMMIT A

429
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:32,403
CRIME.

430
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,537
BUT THEY DIDN'T LOOK FOR IT.

431
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:34,905
THEY MADE UP THEIR MIND BEFORE

432
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:37,842
THEY EVER INTERVIEWED HER ABOUT,

433
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,745
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

434
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,480
HOROWITZ, AND OTHERS, SOME OF

435
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,348
THE COLLEAGUES THAT UNLOCKED THE

436
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,184
FACT THAT THOSE EMAILS WERE

437
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,987
EXPOSED TO FOREIGN ACTORS.

438
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:51,355
>> Bret: IF I DID THIS, I

439
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,724
WOULD BE PROSECUTED.

440
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:54,625
THAT'S IN THE IG REPORT.

441
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,560
>> EXACTLY AND WE FOUND OTHER

442
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,763
EVIDENCE WHERE PEOPLE WERE

443
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:00,164
PROSECUTED FOR ACTIONS SIMILAR,

444
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,500
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE FBI

445
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,067
DIRECTORY CONCLUDED.

446
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,970
>> Bret: THE FBI CASE WAS SLOW

447
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,172
WALKED?

448
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:13,244
>> YES, HE SAT ON EMAILS, AND BY

449
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:14,945
THE TIME COMEY GOT TO THEM AND

450
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:16,947
SENT THE LETTER, WE WERE ON THE

451
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:17,748
EVE OF AN ELECTION.

452
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:18,949
BUT IN SEPTEMBER 1 WHEN HE

453
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,785
LEARNED ABOUT THIS, HE DID

454
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,721
NOTHING BECAUSE HE WAS HYPER

455
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:27,658
FOCUSED ON STRZOK.

456
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,193
>> AND IF I WERE ANY AMERICAN I

457
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:32,897
WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW

458
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,765
DIRECTOR TOMMY HANDLED THAT.

459
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:35,866
WHY WOULD YOU HANDLE THE WAY YOU

460
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:40,738
RELEASE THAT INFORMATION?

461
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:45,176
>> Bret: LET ME PLAY THAT.

462
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:48,212
>> WEEKS WENT BY WITHOUT ANY

463
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:48,546
ACTION.

464
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:50,948
>> I DO KNOW THAT NEW YORK AND

465
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:52,149
FBI HEADQUARTERS BECAME AWARE

466
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:57,288
THAT THERE MAY BE A CONNECTION

467
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:58,155
BETWEEN WEINER'S LAPTOP AND THE

468
00:13:58,155 --> 00:13:58,956
INVESTIGATION.

469
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,324
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY COULD

470
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:02,993
HAVE MOVED FASTER, OR WHY THE

471
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:05,730
DELAY.

472
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,732
>> SO DID THAT REALLY DRIVE YOU

473
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:09,200
TO THE NOT CONCEALED PART?

474
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,970
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A

475
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,972
SLOW ACTIVITY, WHY IT WAS SLOW

476
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,173
THIS FIRST COUPLE WEEKS.

477
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:19,543
>> THERE WAS ONE AGENT AND HE

478
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,345
KNOWS THEY WOULDN'T BE

479
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:21,846
PROSECUTED ANYWAY.

480
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:25,349
>> HE USED THE WORD INDEX, HE

481
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,752
DIDN'T PROPERLY INDEX THE FACT

482
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:29,920
THAT HOUMA ABERDEEN WAS MARRIED

483
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,621
TO ANTHONY WEINER.

484
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,056
HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PERSON

485
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,357
IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAT DIDN'T

486
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:35,593
KNOW THEY WERE MARRIED.

487
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,762
I WAS ONE EXCUSE.

488
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:38,963
HE CALLED TO WASHINGTON

489
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,564
SPECIFICALLY SAYING, WHAT ARE

490
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:41,766
YOU DOING AND WHAT'S TAKING SO

491
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:42,066
LONG?

492
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:46,537
LET'S WHAT FINALLY GOT HIM TO

493
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:47,371
MOVE.

494
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:48,239
McCABE WASN'T MOVING AND

495
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,174
STRZOK WASN'T MOVING.

496
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,410
>> Bret: SOME OF THE TEXT

497
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,344
MESSAGES COULD BE MISSING.

498
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:55,179
>> WE WILL KEEP LOOKING FOR

499
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:55,746
THEM.

500
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,615
HE DID A GOOD JOB AND FROM THE

501
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:58,582
FIRST BIG BATCH OF MISSING TEXT

502
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:01,752
MESSAGES, AND MADE THOSE

503
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,521
AVAILABLE BACK TO THE

504
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,189
DEPARTMENT, WHICH MADE THEM

505
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:06,290
AVAILABLE TO US.

506
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,159
BUT YES, WE HAVE ACTUALLY

507
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,594
BENEFITED IN A MULTITUDE OF WAYS

508
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:11,362
TO THIS INVESTIGATION.

509
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,797
IT'S FILLED AND A PIECE OF THE

510
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,965
PUZZLE BUT ALSO RESULTED IN MORE

511
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:16,100
INFORMATION COMING TO US JUST IN

512
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,336
THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS.

513
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,538
>> Bret: ALL RIGHT, WRAP THIS

514
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:21,338
UP.

515
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,873
WINNER AND LOSER IN THIS IG

516
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:24,175
REPORT IN YOUR MIND?

517
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:27,011
>> I THINK THE FEDERAL

518
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,046
INVESTIGATION BUREAU AS A WHOLE

519
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,481
IS A LOSER AND I HOPE

520
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,749
CHRISTOPHER WRAY IS TAKING THIS

521
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:33,350
SOBERING LESSON TO HEART.

522
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,554
HE CAN DO GREAT THINGS WITH THE

523
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:37,755
PUBLIC'S TRUST IN THIS

524
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:38,889
ORGANIZATION, AND WE ALL SHOULD

525
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:39,590
TRUST.

526
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,660
I THINK 99% OF THE TIME, WE

527
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,395
SHOULD.

528
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,464
>> WINNER IS MICHAEL HOROWITZ,

529
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:49,733
BECAUSE HE PROVES THAT YOU CAN

530
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,669
WIN WITH AN INVESTIGATION.

531
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,370
THE LOSER IS EVERYONE OF MY

532
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,104
FELLOW CITIZENS THAT WANTS AND

533
00:15:54,104 --> 00:00:00,000
FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT
