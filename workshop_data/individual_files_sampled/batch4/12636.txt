joining me now to break this down contributor to The Daily wire Alecia Kraus Alicia good to see you yeah thanks all right Alicia talk to me about this a mistake in judgment is what they're calling this this seems to me to be a lot more than just an error saying that slips by I mean this is a fundamentally different philosophy about what school is all about and I would argue that school should not be teaching these things I mean I recently had an episode of my lady brains cast over on ricochet where we talked about fertility and I as the innocent home schooler just assumed that in sex education women learned you know how ovulation and making babies work but apparently that's not what they're teaching in these things you know they're using peach and eggplant emojis and YouTube videos by famous you know sex talkers to talk about this kind of stuff the administration's response was outrageous too they said well you know we trusted this group they've come in before and there have been no problems with their curriculum before so the teacher and the administrators just mitad admitted that they didn't even check out the video they didn't even look at the detailed curriculum they just approved it because they trusted the source and I'm sorry but when it comes to my kids or American kids in general you need to delve into what is being taught what does the curriculum just say and what are the details and why are they even being taught this right I mean part of this video we showed this part and I in a way I wish that we could show this whole video so that people can realize how shocking this is but I actually don't want to put this on air I don't want this to be in people's living rooms I don't want to pollute our viewers minds but I don't want children to have to see this like they saw in the school the beginning of the video though this girl this YouTube she calls herself a sex educator and I don't know if I would use that similar title but we'll go with it for the sake of the argument she says it's important to understand how male pleasure Anatomy works Alicia is that is that important for a 14 year old child to know absolutely not I would argue that it isn't important for someone to know until like they get married if that was at the age of 23 and turns out you can kind of figure it out without a youtube video folks but I mean it's unbelievable a fourteen-year-old should not be exposed to these things I would not be okay with one day when my daughters are 14 years old to be exposed to these things and if anything I would hope that they would come to me to have these conversations not learn them from a fellow teenager on YouTube in addition to that this group that came in is actually a group that has like anti sexual assault in their name so I don't understand why a group that's supposed to be against sexual assault is now teaching children about the you know how anal sex and blowjobs work I just don't understand it at all no and I wondered after watching this video which I wish that I could unsee here I was kind of scratching my head and saying what's the purpose of this what's the purpose of teaching kids about these things because it's not just a matter I mean I know all these schools always claim listen kids are too embarrassed to ask their parents questions they're gonna be doing these things anyway they need to know how to do it safely I don't think it's that difficult to figure out I mean that's kind of how we're made I don't think that high schoolers should be engaging in that but that seems to me to be a pretty weak argument from teachers what is the purpose behind encouraging in this video this girl this quote-unquote sex educator actually encourages these kids to try these sexual acts with a partner themselves the school is advocating for 14 and 15 year old children to be engaging in oral and anal sex what is the purpose of putting this in children's minds I don't know I think it's a continual downshift of culture and the downgrading of culture and the over-sexualization of culture I think that it's wrong to sexualize fourteen-year-old girls in this way and the left will tell you no no no we want to empower them we want them to be able to you know feel like true feminists that have control of their body but it really does put unnecessary pressure in my opinion and anecdotal evidence and even statistical evidence does show that girls tend to feel like they must act this way and they must do these things in order to get the positive affection of boys and men that are around them and I think that that's just a very dangerous message to send a young woman today it is dangerous it's unhealthy and it's also fundamentally anti-feminist to I guess almost objectify yourself reduce yourself just to that sexual object that you have no worth and have no value to other people unless you I guess serve them sexually how they want to be here's what I think it comes down to - I think that this video is an example and this is perhaps a small outgrowth of this problem this liberal indoctrination that perverts sex wants to tear down marriage once the sort of do away within our culture the traditional family unit on which our society is built because when that happens when people don't have a family when marriage is broken when children don't have that don't have that unit they have to rely on government and if people are relying on government it makes liberal politicians wealthier absolutely and you know it makes groups like this and teachers like this that can get away with it I mean in many states including right here in California if this same incident had happened and you'd had parents that were outraged you know in the city of Los Angeles that teacher would get full pay and just get sent to what that is dubbed as the rubber room for a couple of years New York City Washington DC and other you know teacher unionized strongholds also have something like this so it's really scary about America's public schools is that even when parents aren't happy there's really very little that they can do about it because of the stranglehold that they have on the system right and one of the fathers of one of the ninth graders at the school this is so sad I feel I feel so badly for him he says how do I undo what the school has done how do i erase from my daughter's mind what they have taught her he said I trusted the school and they betrayed me I think he's absolutely right I do think Alicia that there's a solution to this and perhaps it makes sense given the premise if liberals are trying to undermine the family so people rely on government why they don't get on board with this policy but this is something that Republicans I think support but almost as a backburner issue in my opinion we should be bringing it to the front here school choice if parents aren't as involved in their curriculum choices as they want to be if schools are doing things that they don't like if they're indoctrinating their kids whether its history or whether it's these kind of sexual related videos you know if we have school choice these parents they march into the principal's office they march to the school district they hold up their voucher and say this money that comes with my child to the school we are walking out of here we are giving this money and put it giving this money to a different school putting our child somewhere else that would do more than I more than anything else I can think of to tamp down on indoctrination like this I have been saying for a very long time that there are two main issues that I think Republicans all across the nation but specifically here in California could run on and school choice is one of those issues that polls really well no matter what race or ethnic background religious background male or female and the other issues national security and I think that I mean even here in California over 60% of California voters and very liberal I call it the communist state of California sometimes have said that they are for school choice and I really think this is something that Republicans need to get behind because then it empowers not only the parents and in a lot of cases in a lot of parts of Los Angeles for example there would be a single minority parent who wants a better opportunity for their child but it empowers the student because you might have a fourteen-year-old student that isn't a good fit at a certain LAUSD school but has an opportunity to go to a better school for an educational or sports type scholarship and right now in the state they cannot do that so I think that Republicans need to dig and look at those individualized stories and tug at the heartstrings of Republican and Democratic voters alike in the state and across all the country to show that school choice is really a better option for America's children
