we are teaching them the combat leadership principles that we learned on the battlefield the biggest takeaway that you can have from this is taking ownership instead of blaming others finding excuses or maybe denying that that problems exist but looking at yourself and say what can I do better what can I can control it's about me it's not about other people I want move it whole two minutes let's go this morning woke up at 3:30 came to Bryant Park started with a jog and then did an hour of physical training some military-style exercises burpees push-ups sit-ups flutter kick jumping jack by the end I felt like I was going to throw up or I'm definitely wide awake 6 o'clock right now and we're in a beautiful time square a lot of people came here a long way to get here so everyone's in a good mood ready to have a strong day so feeling good we want you guys to be engaged in the game as I know so many of you already are you got to take ownership not just of things that you own but also take ownership of other parts that affect relations so we've had the first couple hours of the seminar some heavy stories that are illustrating these leadership principles I've already been thinking about how I can apply it to my own life the core of making your team work well together you got to have everyone leading and you got to prepare everyone to be the leadership position the guy's just finished talking about the laws of combat in their idea of extreme ownership which is also the title of their book it's kind of the unifying lesson of this whole thing and now we have a team where everyone on the team is taking ownership of the problems and yes therefore the problems will get solved it goes up a chain of command to where the boss isn't doing what you need to do you get to lead up the chain of command you got to take ownership they're really starting to show how to apply these lessons that they learned in the Navy SEALs to business you shouldn't just start relying on your boss for answers so when place comes to me and says hey Jocko we got this mission how should I do it and I go okay which is the best way to do it know once you've shown them what's up I may come to you with a question you say yeah we'll go figure it out don't care make it happen don't be the easy button it's really getting me to think of how I can start offering more and not rely on other people and really own the projects I'm doing what happens is start to question leadership above your own direct boss and their boss or even higher than that we've bought these vows in the SEAL Teams what can late Bab and do about the direction of the war in Iraq we can do our utmost to win in the small little area that we can influence in a way that we can we can hit back about it but I think that's all you can do this guy JP comes out he was one of the seals that served with jockle and lace and he gives this really energetic passionate speech about how to be motivated and how to motivate a team that just leaned into some final lessons from Joplin life that were really interesting to stop and think about how you can apply these things to you the biggest enemy that you could be facing is yourself which it's just a good note to go out on just got done with an intro to Brazilian Jujitsu I got to talk to lay for a little bit after he was saying how one of the main benefits of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is that no matter what your size small person can go up against a big guy and still win if he has the technique down going to stop myself from blaming circumstances or other people like many people that's the bad habit that I can do so that's going to be the main things that I'm going to be thinking about going forward and I did see rich out there and it looked like he was doing a marginal job my hat's off to you good work just work on those push-ups
