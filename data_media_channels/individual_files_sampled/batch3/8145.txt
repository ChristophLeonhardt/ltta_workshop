BENJAMIN HALL, THANK YOU IN JERUSALEM. I'M WATCHING MIKE PENCE ON THE STAGE NOW IN INDIANA. WE'LL TAKE YOU THERE LIVE IN JUST A MOMENT. COLONEL MICHAEL WALTZ HERE WITH ME. FORMER GREEN BERET COMMANDER AND COUNTER TERRORIZER TO VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY. GOOD EVENING TO YOU. HI, BILL. GOOD EVENING. MY SENSE IS THAT YOU GO BACK 12 YEARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, YOU THINK ABOUT SOUTHERN LEBANON, THE BUILD-UP OF HEZBOLLAH AND THE AMOUNT OF ROCKETS THEY HAVE. ALL IT TAKES IS ONE OR TWO RAMP THIS THING UP. I THINK THAT'S THE POINT THAT WE HAVE REACHED AT THE MOMENT. DOES IT GO THERE? OR DOES IT COOL DOWN? WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE CULMINATION OF A COUPLE THINGS. ONE, YOU KNOW, IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH HAVE MADE MORE GAINS IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS UNDER BOTH AS A RESULT OF THE BILLIONS THAT FLOWED IN TO TEHRAN AS PART OF THE IRAN DEAL AND ESSENTIALLY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TURNING ITS BACK ON THE REGION. THAT IS COMING TO A HEAD NOW. A LOT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CRITICS ARE TRYING TO BLAME THE TIMING OF THIS ON HIM BACKING OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL. AS YOU NOTED, THIS HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR SOME TIME. LISTEN, BILL, THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS NOT BEEN BUILDING ROADS AND BRIDGES WITH THE BILLIONS THAT FLOWED IN. THEY'VE BEEN ON A SHOPPING SPREE WITH MOSCOW AND RUSSIAN WEAPONRY, NUMBER 1. NUMBER 2, PUMPING THE MONEY INTO ITS PROXIES INTO SYRIA. THAT'S WHY YOU'VE SEEN SO MANY PROTESTS IN TEHRAN BECAUSE THE IRANIAN PEOPLE HAD AN EXPECTATION THAT THE BILLIONS COMING IN WOULD HELP THE ECONOMY. INSTEAD, THEY HAVE SEEN THE REGIME UP IT INTO MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE ISRAELIS HAD THEIR EYES ON THESE TARGETS A LONG TIME, IN AN AROUND DAMASCUS, ARMED BUT I IRANIAN FORCES. THEY WENT AFTER THEM. THEY'RE REPORTING THIS MISSION WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT JUST YET, MICHAEL. I WOULD CALL IT A BUTT WHIPPING TO USE THE TERM THAT WE USE IN THE SOUTH. THE ISRAELIS REALLY SMACKED THE IRANIANS HARD HERE. I WOULD CALL IT TWO THINGS. ONE, YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT THE IRANIANS ARE ONLY HELPING HEZBOLLAH AND THE PROXIES IN SYRIA. IRANIAN'S GROUND FORCES ARE ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA HELPING THE ASSAD REGIME AND PROPPING IT UP AND BUILDING UP ITS INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE ISRAELI BORDER TO HIT OUR GREATEST ALLY. WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW AND KNOWS IS THAT WE HAVE TO STAND WITH OUR ALLY AND THE ISRAELIS ESSENTIALLY TOOK THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OUT. THIS IS A REAL SHIFT ON THE ISRAELI PART. THEY HAVE BEEN KIND OF HOLDING BACK AND LETTING ISIS AND THE SUNNI EXTREMISTS FIGHT IT OUT WITH ASSAD AND HEZBOLLAH AND THE SHIIA EXTREMISTS. IT GOT TO THE POINT NOW WHERE THEY HAD TO STEP INTO A BIG WAY AND THEY DID SO AND DID SO INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVELY. MY FEELING NOW IS WHAT DOES IRAN DO IN KIND? WE CAN'T ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW. BUT ON MONDAY, THE U.S. EMBASSY MOVES FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM. THERE WILL BE A U.S. DELEGATION IN JERUSALEM FOR THAT MOMENT. YOU KNOW THE UNREST ITS CAUSED ALONG THE GAZA STRIP THE PAST MONTH. WHAT IS NEXT THEN? WHAT IS NEXT THEN? THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS MILITARILY BUT DIPLOMATICALLY AND REALIZING THE PROMISE OF THE LAST THREE TO FOUR PRESIDENTS, SINCE THE MID 90s IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING A CAPITOL THAT IS REALLY ALWAYS EXISTED AND THE ISRAELIS HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST. ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN FOR SOME TIME AND WE HAVE TO STAND WITH THE ISRAELIS MILITARILY. THEY CANNOT AND WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THE IRANIANS IN A VERY STRONG WAY TO BUILD UP ON THEIR BORDER. THEY'VE TAKEN THEM OUT. Bill: ONE MORE QUESTION. THESE PEOPLE IN ELKHART INSIDE THAT GYM, HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT RIPPING UP THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN? I GUESS IS YOU LIKE IT WHEN YOU STICK IT TO THEM. THEY REALIZE AND THEY SEE THIS PRESIDENT AS STANDING WITH OUR ALLIES AND SHOWING STRENGTH TO OUR ADVERSARIES, WHETHER THAT IS NORTH KOREA, CHINA, RUSSIA OR IRAN. WHAT WE ALL INSTINCTIVELY KNOW IS THAT THOSE REGIMES RESPECT AND RESPOND TO STRENGTH. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN NORTH KOREA. THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE WITH THE
