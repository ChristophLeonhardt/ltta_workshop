remember the scene in 1984 when Winston's friends Syme is enlightening him about the latest edition of the Newspeak dictionary over lunch this is the part of the book I remember when I see the left change terms like illegal alien to undocumented immigrants and now just immigrant to serve a political agenda and it's also what I thought of when I saw this professor shudder when she saw a certain word applied to a certain favorite so-called victim group of the left let's take a look if you enjoy the YouTube comedy in prank scene you might be familiar with Youssef Erakat or fouseytube whose YouTube channel boasts over 10 million subscribers but while Youssef excels at making jokes his sister George Mason University professor Noura Erakat pretty much is the joke on Thursday Nora tweeted out a Washington Post article entitled Israel's use of fatal force in Gaza excessive force or justified mob control remember the infighting over Israel I discussed Wednesday on campus and massed between professors and other progressive luminaries like Bernie Sanders well this appears to be another example because this Washington Post headline triggered Nora who responded mob can we please try to acknowledge Palestinians as human not bugs to be exterminated this is a freedom struggle when I saw this awesome display of intellectual brilliance I immediately put aside all thoughts like the fact that at least fifty of the sixty two individuals killed by Israel Monday or Hamas or Islamic Jihad terrorists and thought to myself wow what an upstanding citizen Nora must be police scene offensive words out of the English language it never even occurred to me that she might be a total hypocrite who shudders when the word mob is applied to Palestinians but has used the exact same word to describe Israelis oops actually here's one of her tweets from a little while back padilla lune shot dead by Israeli police when he ran away from an Israeli mob and of course she neglects to mention that a loon had allegedly stabbed a Jewish boy right beforehand in case this didn't convince you of house superb a mental gymnast Nora is contorting language to fit her agenda take a look at this time she tweeted about the murder of a Muslim teen in Virginia she says white supremacy breeds in all quarters especially in the most liberal ones we call home except as a commenter pointed out the teens accused murderer Darwyn Martinez Torres was not white but Hispanic Nora of course very adept ly dodged this pesky fact by saying white supremacy is an ideology and what drives Islamophobia not race specific don't need to be white to practice it that's right white supremacy isn't race specific but it does probably include all whites as Nora seemed to say after the election of Trump tweeting that white nationalism carried Trump with a breakdown of different white demographics and saying last night white people in the u.s. passed a referendum affirming their righteous entitlement to dominate the rest of us hashtag white nationalism though you might want to check the spelling on that hashtag professor but wow aren't you grateful that you don't even have to sign up for the Berkeley educated dr.
