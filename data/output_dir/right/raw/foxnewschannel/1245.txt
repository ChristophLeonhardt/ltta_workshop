4
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:17,143
THE 64-YEAR-OLD HAD MORE THAN

CONFISCATED BY U.S. CUSTOMS AT

THE CLEVELAND AIRPORT.

8
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:25,318
IT WAS THE RESULT OF A

9
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,452
CONTROVERSIAL PRACTICE CALLED

10
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,254

BACK, DESPITE NEVER BEING

13
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:35,094

CRIME, YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO BE

23
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,721

OFFERED NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

THE ALLEGATIONS.

32
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:16,970
THE AGENCY RELEASED A STATEMENT

THE FAMILY SAYS THERE WAS NO

49
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:44,831
ARTFUL DECEPTION.

50
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,366
THE MONEY WAS WRAPPED IN PAPER,

51
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,535
PLACED IN HIS CARRY-ON, AND THAT

52
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:51,037
ANY INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS WERE

53
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:54,407
BECAUSE OF HIS POOR ENGLISH.

54
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:55,842
KAZAZI IS A RETIRED POLICE

55
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:57,010
OFFICER FROM ALBANIA.

56
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,012

A VACATION HOME.

64
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,692
HE CLAIMS HE TOOK THE $58,000 IN

65
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:14,127
CASH BECAUSE HE DOES NOT TRUST

66
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:15,728
THE ALBANIAN BANKING SYSTEM.

67
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,730
WHEN HE GOT TO THE AIRPORT IN

CLEVELAND, KAZAZI SAYS WAS NOT

69
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,869
ONLY WAS HIS MONEY CONFISCATED,

70
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:25,371
HE WAS SUBJECTED TO A

71
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,973
HUMILIATING STRIP SEARCH, BUT

72
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,242
UNDER ASSET FORFEITURE LAWS IT'S

73
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,210
INCUMBENT ON MR. KAZAZI TO PROVE

74
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,946
HE'S NOT UP TO SOMETHING

75
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,415
NEFARIOUS, WHICH IS WHY HE'S

76
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,618
FILED A LAWSUIT TO GET BACK HIS

77
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,286
58 GRAND.

78
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,989

JOINING US ERROLL KAZAZI.

80
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:52,899
WHAT WAS YOUR DAD DOING WITH HIS

81
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:54,067
ENTIRE LIFESAVINGS?

82
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:58,705
>> HE WAS PLANNING ON TAKING

83
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:01,441
CARE OF OUR FORMER HOME WHICH

84
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:03,109
NEEDED REPAIRS, AND THEY WERE

85
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,344
PLANNING ON A VACATION HOME

86
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:05,044
WHERE THEY COULD RETIRE.

87
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,846
>> HE'S BRINGING ALL HIS MONEY

88
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,348
OVER, GOT IT WRAPPED IN PAPER IN

89
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:09,015
THE BAG.

90
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:10,383
THEY SAY THAT IT WAS CONCEALED

91
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:12,685
IN AN ODD WAY, THAT THEY

92
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,787
SUSPECTED THAT HE MIGHT BE

93
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:16,589
GUILTY OF SOME KIND OF SMUGGLING

94
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,659
OR DRUG TRAFFICKING OR MONEY

95
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:20,059
LAUNDERING.

96
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,427
HAS HE EVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH

97
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:22,695
ANY CRIMES OF THOSE ACTIVITIES

98
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:23,162
EVER?

99
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,932
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

100
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:28,201
THOSE ACCUSATIONS ARE COMPLETELY

101
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:28,568
BASELESS.

102
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,570
THE FACT THAT THEY EVEN HAD TO

103
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,139
LIST FOUR OF THEM WITHOUT BEING

104
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,074
CLEAR ON ONE THEY'RE TRYING TO

105
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:37,009
STATE KIND OF MAKES THIS ALL

106
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,511
EVEN MORE CONFUSING.

107
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,446
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE, BECAUSE

108
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:44,417
NONE OF THAT EVER HAPPENED.

109
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,151
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS

110
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,185
TALKING TO THEM?

111
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,687
THEY SAY HE GAVE INCONSISTENT

112
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,488
STATEMENTS, AND THAT WAS WHAT

113
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:55,161
SORT OF OPENED THE DOOR FOR THEM

114
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:58,931
TO CONFISCATE HIS MONEY, AND AS

115
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,901
YOU HEARD TRACE GALLAGHER SAY

116
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,269
THEY'VE TAKEN $2 BILLION THAT

117
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:03,636
WAY REAM.

118
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:05,671
>> I THINK WHAT HAPPENED WITH

119
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,607
THEM MAKING THE CLAIMS FOR

120
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,942
INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS WAS THEM

121
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,244
NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HIS

122
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,712
POOR ENGLISH.

123
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:13,780
IF THEY HAD BOTHERED TO CONTACT

124
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,249
A TRANSLATOR, EVEN A FAMILY

125
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:19,786
MEMBER, THEY COULD HAVE TRIED

126
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,721
REACHING OUT TO ME OR MY MOTHER,

127
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,823
SO WE COULD TRANSLATE FOR HIM,

128
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:24,857
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THOSE

129
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:25,191
ISSUES.

130
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,793
>> DID HE REQUEST A TRANSLATOR?

131
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:27,693
>> YES.

132
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:28,661
HE DID SEVERAL TIMES.

133
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,929
>> UNBELIEVABLE THAT HE WAS

134
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:30,263
DENIED.

135
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:32,265
WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY DOING NOW?

136
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:35,334
WHAT'S YOUR LEGAL RECOURSE?

137
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,103
>> WE FILED A MOTION FOR A

138
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:46,446
RETURN OF PROPERTY.

139
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:50,483
SINCE THEY MISSED THE DEADLINES

140
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:52,151
WE'RE EXPECTING THE MONEY BACK,

141
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,619
BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING

142
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:53,986
BACK.

143
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:56,289
THEY TOOK THE MONEY IN 2017, AND

144
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,090
IT'S BEEN A PAINFUL PROCESS TO

145
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,991
DEAL WITH SINCE THEN.

146
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,760
>> HOW FRUSTRATING HAS IT BEEN

147
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,994
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

148
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,095
GOVERNMENT, TRYING TO TELL THEM

149
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,066
YOUR STORY, AND TRYING TO MAKE A

150
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:07,366
CASE?

151
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:09,101
>> WE TRIED TO REACHING OUT TO

152
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,871
THEM IN THE BEGINNING, AND THE

153
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,106
ONLY OPTIONS THEY GAVE US THAT

154
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,641
YOU WOULD RECEIVE A LETTER THAT

155
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,510
WOULD LIST FOUR OPTIONS, WHETHER

156
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,945
YOU CHOOSE TO ABANDON THE MONEY,

157
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,646
MAKE AN OFFER IN COMPROMISE,

158
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:22,782
WHERE YOU LET THEM KEEP PART OF

159
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:26,319
IT, YOU COULD GO THROUGH AND

160
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,088
ADMINISTER A PETITION, WHICH IS

161
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,257
THE PROCESS THEY DO TO NEGOTIATE

162
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:32,758
WITH THEM, OR REQUEST COURT

163
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:33,092
ACTION.

164
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:34,560
>> WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON YOUR

165
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,628
FAMILY OF THE LOSS OF THIS

166
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:39,632
MONEY?

167
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,235
>> IT'S DEVASTATING.

168
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:45,838
HE HAD HOMES TO MAKE REPAIRS IN

169
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:46,973
ALBANIA, UTILITIES AND BILLS TO

170
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:47,540
PAY OVER THERE.

171
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,576
HE WANTED TO LOOK AT A FEW HOMES

172
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:54,947
ON THE ADRIANIC COAST AND DECIDE

173
00:05:54,947 --> 00:06:05,858
WHAT TO DO FOR RETIREMENT.

174
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:12,565
WHAT TO DO FOR RETIREMENT.

175
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,500
>> WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HEAR

176
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,835
THE NEXT STEP ON THIS?

177
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:21,007
>> I'M HOPING VERY SOON.

178
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,508
THEY HAVE TO RETURN THE MONEY AT

179
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:22,909
THIS POINT.

180
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,777
WE'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

181
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,078
>> QUITE A STORY.

182
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:26,879
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TELLING

183
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,180
IT TO US.

184
00:06:28,180 --> 00:00:00,000
LET US KNOW.
