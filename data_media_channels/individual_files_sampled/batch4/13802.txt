the aspect here that really makes me not want this assignment even if I could have gotten it is that everybody is filthy there's no cleanliness to this thing when you get there you're encouraged to kind of just roll around in the dirt because there aren't a lot of showers now if there are any showers at all people clean off with a little bit of water or soapy water or something and just two people lying around doing drugs in sweltering heat in the Nevada desert for days and days and days and then frolicking around a filthy orgy dome where 5000 people have been before you is if that is not enough to get you to run to church right now get down on your knees beg forgiveness and never leave I don't know what is but this is the promise of Burning Man the promise of Burning Man is that you're entering another world in this world you have to clean yourself and work and like read books and you know wake up on time and take care of people and have accountability and cook dinner and all these things in at Burning Man it's another world it's a different world you don't have to bathe if you don't have to do anything you can roll around in the dirt you can have sex with whomever you like it's long you know I mean presumably you have to like get a chick to like you but I don't know if everybody's hopped up on ecstasy I don't know how hard that is then you you know listen to electronic music even that aspect it's not like you're listening to Brahms and Beethoven you're listening to music that speaks to what Aristotle and Plato would call the base passions that is just all a base it's all percussion it's all speaking to that part of you which is rhythmic and tribal so you're just kind of moving and going with the flow man it's another world
