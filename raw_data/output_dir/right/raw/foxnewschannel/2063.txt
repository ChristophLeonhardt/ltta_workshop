00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:26,548
SUCH JOKES WERE MADE ABOUT

27
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:33,889
BARACK AND MICHELLE OR HILLARY?

REACTION.

31
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:41,964
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING

32
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:45,868
IT'S AN OUTRAGE DON'T SAY THAT

33
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,005
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

34
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:50,372
SOMETHING.

35
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:52,541
HOWIE: YOU FEEL -- YOU HAVE

36
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,343
WRITTEN THIS, THAT THOSE FOLKS,

37
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:56,445
MANY OF THOSE COMMENTATORS GIVE

38
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:58,180
THE PRESIDENT A PASS FOR SOME OF

39
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,482
THE THINGS HE SAYS.

40
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:05,821
KAT: PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE FUN OF

41
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,258
MIKA'S LOOKS AND ROSIE

42
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:09,692
O'DONNELL.

43
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,428
BUT WHEN A MEDIAN WHO THERE IS

44
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:15,130
TO ROAST PEOPLE MAKES FUN OF

45
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,165
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS THEN IT'S

46
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:17,933
AN OUTRAGE.

47
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,935
EITHER IT'S AN OUTRAGE ALL THE

48
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:23,172
TIME OR NONE OF THE TIME.

49
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:25,307
IT DRIVES ME NUTS TO SEE THIS.

50
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:27,176
IT'S NOT CONSISTENT.

51
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:34,049
I DO THINK THAT MICHEL WOLF IS A

52
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,284
COMEDIAN, NOT THE PRESIDENT.

53
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,252
AND THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE HELD

54
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:40,055
TO A HIGHER STANDARD.

55
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:42,191
AND PEOPLE WHO HAD PROBLEMS WITH

56
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,826
THE WAY SHE TREATED SARAH

57
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:44,727
HUCKABEE SANDERS SHOULD HAVE

58
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,595
PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY PRESIDENT

59
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:50,065
TRUMP TREATED WOMEN IN THE PAST.

60
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:54,169
HOWIE: THE WHITE HOUSE

61
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,206
CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION HIRED

62
00:02:57,206 --> 00:03:00,642
MICHELLE WOLF KNOWING SHE HAS A

63
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:03,812
HISTORY OF CRUDENESS AND IS

64
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:05,314
ANTI-TRUMP.

65
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:07,716
DOESN'T IT PLAY INTO THE

66
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:09,485
PRESIDENT'S HANDS BY SHOWING THE

67
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:12,221
MEDIA TO BE THE SYMBOL OF THAT

68
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,623
DINNER LOOKS TO BE A LOT OF

69
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:15,190
MEDIA BIAS.

70
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,993
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME

71
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:20,295
OUT OF THIS LOOKING LIKE A NICE

72
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:20,763
GUY.

73
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:22,097
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS CAME OUT

74
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:24,199
LOOKING NICE AND LIKE A VICTIM.

75
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,968
EVEN SOME PEOPLE ON THE LEFT

76
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:29,471
SAID THIS WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

77
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,839
THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS

78
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:33,208
DINNER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE

79
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,244
GETTING INTO.

80
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:38,213
HOWIE: DO YOU SEE THE SAME

00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,283
COMMENTARY?

83
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:43,218
IMAGINE WHEN BARACK OBAMA WERE

84
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:45,420
UNDER A SPECIAL COUNSEL

85
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,854
INVESTIGATION.

86
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,990
WHEN WE SEE CONSERVATIVES AND

87
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,092
LIBERALS SWITCHING SIDES AND

88
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:51,527
SOME OF THE OUTRAGE OR DEFENSE

89
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:55,397
OF THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE

90
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:55,764
EXPRESSED.

91
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:58,133
>> WE KNOW FOR A FACT THEY WILL

92
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:58,901
SWITCH SIDE.

93
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,436
WE SAW THAT WITH PRESIDENT

94
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:01,870
CLINTON.

95
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,507
THEY SAID IT'S JUST SEX, IT

96
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,442
DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

97
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,044
NOW WE ARE SEEING THE SAME

98
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:12,681
TALKING POINTS ON EACH SIDE

99
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:16,752
EXCEPT THEY ARE FLIPPED.

100
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:22,457
HOWIE: "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" DID

101
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:25,194
A STORMY DANIELS SKIT AND DID

102
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:27,696
NOT USE AN ACTRESS.

103
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:30,098
>> IT'S JUST AN ACT.

104
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:33,802
>> I WORK IN ADULT FILMS, WE ARE

105
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:37,039
NOT KNOWN FOR OUR ACTING.

106
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,876
HOWIE: SHOULD WE REMOVE ANY LAST

107
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:44,146
PRETENSE THIS PROGRAM IS

108
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,614
VIRULENTLY ANTI-TRUMP AND NOT

109
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:49,051
ABOUT COMEDY.

110
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,986
KAT: IT'S NOT AS FUNNY BECAUSE

111
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,322
OF IT BECAUSE WE KNOW WHERE THE

112
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:54,656
JOKES ARE GOING.

113
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,124
THE PUNCH LINE IS GOING TO BE

114
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:58,861
THE PRESIDENT IS AN IDIOT, THE

115
00:04:58,861 --> 00:04:59,962
PRESIDENT IS A LIAR.

116
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:02,497
THE PEOPLE WATCHING IT AND ENJOY

117
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:04,266
IT WILL HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP NO

118
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,400
MATTER WHAT.

119
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,103
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM,

120
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:11,373
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT STORMY

121
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:11,707
DANIELS.

122
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:16,478
HOWIE: ALEC BALDWIN HAS MADE IT

123
00:05:16,478 --> 00:00:00,000
CLEAR HE DETESTS PRESIDENT
