joining us now a reporter has been on the front lines of this family separation story since it began MSNBC's Jacob Soboroff and in Boston physician and founder and CEO of the nonprofit seed Global Health dr. Vanessa Kerry good to have you both on board Jacob you've been thank you trying to see what you can see inside these what will we call them facilities yeah detention centers in Center one detention center one place they call a shelter look I really just want to say in all seriousness normally I come out of it we have a great time but I past few days I just got back yesterday I witnessed one of the most despicable moments in modern American history I saw kids locked in cages sitting on floors supervised by security guard contractors in a watchtower in McAllen Texas and I will never forget it and I don't think the American people should ever forget what happened because this should never ever happen again it's the worst thing that I've ever seen in my entire life yeah take up at your reporting's McCrone try and take us in Laura Ingraham has referred to them as boarding schools and and summer camps which is disgusting this pickle take us inside as much as you can as if we were there with you it's just wildly inaccurate you know the first place I went was that former Walmart where kids are inside 22 hours a day Donny and they they get outside for two hours a day and that was luxurious compared to what I saw in McAllen and I just wish that the first lady when she was there yesterday would have been able to go and actually see that facility not the new Hope shelter where kids are well taken care of HHS by all accounts really come it takes care of these kids their social service providers and they that's what they do but the Border Patrol station where we saw those cages is it is horrifying that it's fit it's 55,000 square feet on one side of parents and unaccompanied minors and a huge number of those unaccompanied minors were taken away from their parents and sitting there by themselves and I what happened to those kids where are they now some of the kids that I saw there we literally just don't know where they are even the 500 that have been reunited there's still 2,000 of them and some of them may have been the kids that I saw and I witnessed that day Wow Joe jump in yeah Jacob talked about the access that reporters are able to get to see these kids locked in cages or whatever reporters allowed to see what are you kept away from its virtual Joe it's virtually non-existent the eds far as access and I'm just lucky that I was able to actually get into that facility and I think that the only reason that I got the call on Saturday you know and I left Saturday night at midnight slept on the floor of the Dallas Airport to rush to get there on Sunday morning on Father's Day had left my own father's day to get there is because DHS wanted us to get in that facility before the Democrats got in that facility and they expected this huge backlash obviously a barrage of attacks against the administration when the Codell went in there on Monday morning and so that's the only reason in my personal opinion that we got let inside this facility no other journalists no other people were actually allowed to lay eyes on that group of kids other than other than the group that I went in there with so a dr. Vanessa Kerry Steve Global Health works on training doctors around the world so that they can deal with their own humanitarian crises and epidemics and develop and yet you want to lend your voice to this one you reached out to us we've loved working with you on seed but tell us what is striking you and what is striking so close to home for you as a doctor in terms of this separation story it's a couple things you know I'm a physician I'm also a mother and I you know when I've been holding my own children so tightly over the last week thinking about the anguish not only that the parents are going through but what these kids are going through there are years and years of data that show what the psychological physical and lasting impacts of separation of children from their families is even if these families get reunited these kids are going to be suffering a lifetime of effects from this and we are just creating a vicious cycle you know as we are sitting here having this debate thousands of children and families are still being traumatized has been one of the most egregious exploitation of a human rights issue for political purposes that this administration has done and it is just morally indecent and unacceptable I'm watching this country go back to its darkest days as a physician my job is to nurture and heal my patients but as a mother my job is to nurture and protect my children and part of that means also showing them what it means to be a global citizen and part of the world that we will not only give to but that we benefit from and this just hits me in the deepest core of anything Joe yeah I Jacob tell me when you were describing what was going on tell me about the people that are taking care of the kids were you able to talk to the border agents obviously they're they're being put in an extremely extremely difficult position right now because of the policy what can you tell us about that you make a really good point Joe is that these Border Patrol agents many of them are parents themselves I think 50% of them are Latino actually themselves and I was told inside that facility that they were they didn't have the manpower they were overloaded they were stretched then the system was wearing thin even if they had supported the policy and so when I was in there that day when the policy was still in effect there were only four social workers that were contractors outside this pen basically this cage where the little kids were and the Border Patrol agents themselves are not licensed social care workers so even though that facility is only supposed to hold these families and kids for 72 hours the kids could ultimately be left in there for up to 24 hours alone when HHS is supposed to come and pick them up in the Border Patrol agents weren't even allowed to touch them not pick them up or you know change a diaper or whatever the case may be and they were relying on for Social Care workers for for conceivably what could have been hundreds of kids and it was just a manpower issue and then also a human issue like you're alluding to these are these are real people too that go out and execute their operators the policies of Donald Trump in Washington DC on the ground so Vanessa what's your general assessment obviously you haven't treated any of these kids or work for it firsthand with them of what the impact could be on them the lasting impact of being taken away from your mother because as you point out even a very young child is painfully aware of what's happening in that moment yeah so we took the work I've done overseas and through seed Global Health I spent a lot of time working with families that have endured trauma one form or another whether it's just object poverty or if it is you know very directly having experienced a trauma and you know it's it has very lasting impacts for children in terms of mental health depression physical implications increased cardiovascular disease hormonal changes there's lasting effects but when we we also know through research that children who are separated from their families are more likely to live in poverty in the future to have social behavioral disturbances so when we're talking about you know what we're effectively damaging a generation for years to come and that's going to be on us yeah it certainly is dr. Vanessa Kerry we really appreciate your voice on many levels on this and Jacob Soboroff thank you for your reporting Jake one last question time just so it seems to me Joe raises yesterday it still continues to have really troubled me that although there have been some pre-approved pictures given in some of these cases you were allowed to get into access but there are not cameras that have been allowed to shoot real footage now in in places even that you have toured and then there are other places that nerd still no cameras that's right no picture that come out what do you think is a practical matter can be done by the profession right now to try to get the kind of accountability that Americans deserve because we are paying for those facilities I'll give you one example they send out a couple days ago photos of girls and tender age children as they're calling them facilities in Virginia and I think in Homestead Florida where there is a tour today at 9 o'clock the morning and I refuse I'm not gonna share those pictures until someone actually gets eyes on the facility itself I don't think it's appropriate for any of us as journalists or citizens to talk about photos from inside those facilities handed out by the guts propaganda handed out by the government until we're allowed to lay our own eyes on them so if we're not allowed her own care what sin if we're not allowed to bring her on cameras in at least we have to be able to get in to see and give our version hostage video it's incredible and that's where we're at Joe yeah and and again it's something that I wrote in the post this morning talking about this situation a conservative former intelligence operative grimly recounted to me on Thursday how much the handling of these displaced children reminded him of the CIA facilities were terrorists secretly held and interrogated after September 11th quote this reminds me of our black sites except we were holding a hundred or so adult terrorists for the killing of American citizens now 2,300 kids are held in unknown locations with unknown individuals inside and absolutely no outside observation this is happening in America and that statement came from a top Intel official a hardened conservative who believed you had to do what you had to do to get information from terrorists who finds what is happening this week absolutely despicable and unamerican and this is they are treating these children sites like black sites the arranging the press should be able to to get in there and we don't we don't need to get propaganda from the federal government Donald Trump centralized state right now has thrown infants and toddlers and babies inside facilities and they're not letting us see inside of there so Mike Pence Pompeo mattis these are people that we know no this is wrong the DHS secretary Kristen Nielsen that remains to be seen this is a presidency that is rotten at the top and we all have to try and call it out what's happening here is unamerican will be watching jacob's Dateline special report the dividing line 7 o'clock Eastern on Sunday night right here on NBC ron on NBC up next New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio joins us after the federal government used the cover of darkness to drop off more than 200 separated migrants kids in his city we are talking about America we're back in a moment thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
