2
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,260
start with coming up with the cool idea

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,449
oh you hang out with friends you make

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,320

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">way too late and then write it all down</font>

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,869
find the good parts and use those for a

7
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,929
project that I recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> just did we shot</font>

8
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,200
for like four hours and and it's going

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a one-minute video so almost</font>

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,820
nothing is ends up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun finished</font>

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,219
product that is the complete normal that

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,649
is exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time it</font>

13
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,420
kind of drives you a little bit insane

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,579
like you keep looking at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

15
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,710
over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so after a</font>

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,160
feedback notice the smallest things and

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,320
and then you start getting that I and so

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,359
you start noticing them yourself and

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,880
then a project never fully finished

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,650
because you're like oh well I wish I

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,570
could have caught two frames earlier on

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,000
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the creative outlet and if you</font>
