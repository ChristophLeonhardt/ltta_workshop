too grace ah happy family look at this
shit happy family that's what I like to
see okay now I believe I did I've played
this game before but I played it when it
first came out which was like four or
five years ago oh yeah this is something
that I liked you can listen to what
you're thinking I better take a shower
and get dressed before I go downstairs
okay
now I remember bits and bobs of this but
I can't remember a lot okay let's take a
shower
Oh naked naked
I'm obviously a bit of evidence of
nudity to a stop I can't show that might
kind of shoot it I don't get I'm showing
it okay it's a bit of us okay a little
bit of acid hurt nobody and the man's
are so it's okay okay
I'm not censoring that shit I don't care
all right Chuck try me YouTube trying Oh
a drip down a little bit of the other
bum again
oh well okay latest toys Willie there
okay shove the controller shake shake
shake I love how you clean your head
with the towel okay shake it again
oh man the one thing that I love about
this game is the soundtrack the
soundtrack is probably most beautiful
thing ever
oh where do the boxes from those better
be new boxes okay what do we do now
brush our teeth sure why not
are you gonna make me do some stupid
controller like shake shake the
controller motion again here we go shake
it shake it
this simulation of brushing my teeth man
this the start of it is really slow this
whole level which just takes place in my
own home but yeah it picks up a whole
lot layer but I kind of like this is
sort of like this is like a really cool
tutorial oh I'm gonna shave now oh oh
yeah I've got to do this one slowly when
this symbol up is otherwise I'll cut
myself
easy there well but I cut myself
oh do i up nothing happens this is like
a cool tutorial level if you kind of
think about it you know it's a cool way
of telling you how to do the controls
and stuff I like it okay oh man I miss
this game so much ah when I first played
this when I was a little baby okay when
the game first came out I was mind blown
okay now we see the game like this on
the ps3 it was mind-blowing okay
Oh check myself out in the mirror damn
little fancy damn damn
fancy oh oh oh check it Oh up stud I'm
starting on I asked Oh buddy hello
little bud do we tweet hello why did we
do tonight
okay shut up bud
okay now that we've had our shower I
think we can now get changed we get
changed for the cupboard
boom let's rap a bit all right now what
do I want to wear I guess this only one
option now this game has like loads and
loads of choices okay and beyond two
souls you had choices but none of them
really mattered in the end but this game
has some big big big big big choices
okay and I'm not talking about what
shirt to wear in the morning I am
talking about mind-blowing choices okay
now the other thing there's any any of
them like like right now but later on
the game it gets bloody connect easy
okay let's go upstairs what am I
thinking
work I've got some time before Grace and
the kids get back better get some work
done
oh okay oh yeah I remember this you had
to do work on the birthday party
decorations my stupid kid is having his
10 year old birthday party the
character's thoughts changed with this
situation garden nice day outside maybe
I could squeeze in a little garden time
garden time or do you bloody game oh
what's that what's that down here what's
this a bloody remote control
what is this control and a ps3
controller huh what's this car do it
NASCAR yeah what the poisonous
what this is Ethan alright grow up okay
stupid Ethan alright you're an old man
why are you playing with your kids toys
Ethan okay so the main characters name's
Ethan if you guys didn't know or you
wouldn't know unless you've played it
before okay now if I want to do work
wait what's this over here a book
creative architecture
right oh yeah I'm an architect I just I
remember that yeah yeah yeah so if I go
to my little office on the Left I can
work on my architect ship okay so let's
go over here and I believe we can do
some work over here yeah that that's my
architect room okay let's sit down oh
yeah baby
okay oh yeah I remember this I remember
I didn't do this so my first let's play
when I first did it
oh yeah gonna draw some shit Oh draw
that Oh fancy lime can you do it again
Oh what beauty is the next van Gogh
ladies and gentlemen okay that's a weird
moment Oh watch it even the smut is just
so beautiful
okay I'm not doing anything but it's
just beautiful it's just calming am i
ruining the atmosphere I probably am a
man for actions requiring time and
position press X okay triangle oh shit
see I don't like this because it you in
beyond two souls they use color but this
doesn't have color okay so I might mess
up the QuickTime events a lot more but
I'm doing a pretty good job okay
I'm quite familiar with the PlayStation
controls I've had every PlayStation okay
so I feel I've been using it for a very
long time okay now we've done that okay
that was a good that's a good drawing
Ethan okay we have a choice to get up or
do more okay I want to do some more work
I want to see what the finished products
like okay now God do it slowly
yeah yeah nice line Ethan yeah like that
shit great moves
Ethan keep it up I'm proud of you Oh
hold the triangle oh my god this is
great gameplay hold the l1 I don't think
I can do this guy's if they ask me they
asked me for a circle oh this is so
exhilarating gameplay I'm watching right
now oh man this game of often gets
critiqued because it's not really a game
it's more like a movie you know like it
doesn't really matter that I'm doing my
work in this artificial game but um you
know you just gotta respect it you know
not all games are the same okay oh I can
do some more drawings okay I'm now
rubbing out everything he doesn't like
it rub it all out there okay what's he
doing now he's rubbing out all the
shading I think man it must be really
hard to be an architect man III could
not draw stuff like this Jesus Christ
look at him go rubbing out that lines up
I was quick is that it am i dumb or what
more stuff can I do am I gonna color it
in my goodness shake it I'm shaking it
I'm coloring it in
okay can you start I hate this motion
it's so annoying
okay and my dad keeps going I'm done
okay I'm done Jesus Christ okay I think
