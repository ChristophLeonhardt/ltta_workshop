- Hey, YouTube world.
It's me, Evelyn.
I'm excited for this one.
I'm excited.
I'm a little nervous,
and I don't know why.
I thoroughly enjoy reading memoirs.
The art and the skill of telling
your own story is very powerful.
How does one tell one's own story?
How does one talk about oneself?
And I have many memoirs,
and I think all of y'all watching this
also have lots of memoirs.
I have Tumblr posts from when I was 19.
I have cassette tapes of me
and my mom singing Sunday
school songs together.
I told her to hush though,
'cause it was my solo.
Photographs.
I have albums and albums of photos
that my parents have taken
that really just show my personality.
Hit, hit, hit, hit.
Pizza.
I even have this YouTube channel.
Hours and hours of footage
that represent years
and years of my life and my thoughts.
I can see, like, oh my gosh,
I used to be a skinny neck,
big forehead, no eyebrow having girl,
and now I'm just like a thick neck,
still got a forehead,
illustrate my eyebrows woman.
You feel me?
Progress.
And I also have my diary.
Journal.
Book of secrets.
But I think in a fit of teenage angst,
I threw away a lot of
my childhood diaries.
What was I thinking?
But what I did find was ripped out pages
from one of my earliest journals.
I was maybe nine years old, maybe 10,
and I don't know why
Rage Evelyn saved these.
But it's what I have.
And in this video I would like to
read these diary entries aloud to you.
Let's begin.
October 11th, 1999.
I was nine.
Dear Diary, today was good.
I had a good day.
We get it!
The history test was moved to next week.
Amen?!
I had a stomachache all through PE.
Lunch was good.
Catherine's parents came today.
Who is Catherine?
I had homework.
Bible.
I went to a private
Christian elementary school.
Bible, math and spelling.
Mom made dinner.
Yum.
I had to repeat homework.
Damn.
I played.
I'm in bed.
Well, bye.
Signed, Evelyn.
Hold up, I signed it, hold up.
Alright, we're nine years old.
We're using very basic sentences.
We are not offering any
sort of descriptive...
no adjectives.
We jump to November 28th, 1999.
Dear Diary, I had a good day.
At least I be having good days.
I went to church.
David was there.
Ah!
Oh no!
Did I like David?
Oh no.
Okay, hold up.
Who is David?
I ate a big lunch.
Steve went to sleep.
Okay, so Steve is my younger brother.
So if this is 1999, he's four years old.
So maybe it's relevant that
I'm saying the baby finally asleep.
Steve went to sleep.
I went outside.
We played professors.
I made my own software.
Look at us playing pretend.
Okay.
In the morning, I wrote a story.
I was always me.
Dad went out to buy something.
Probably RadioShack, to be honest.
Remember RadioShack?
We had dinner.
Yum.
I had a hole in my school shorts.
We had uniforms.
Ah!
Mom sewed it back together.
I still have to pick a book.
I know God.
I underlined it.
I know God will help me with the report.
(gospel music)
(speaking in tongues)
Watch.
I underlined God.
Mhm.
God!
Shondo!
(laughing)
July 17th, 2000.
Alright, so we survived Y2K,
and I am still nine.
I turn 10 the next month.
(menacing classical music)
Dear Diary, I have to tell you something.
Steve is a crybaby.
He's a baby.
He was jumping on my bed,
and I told him to get down.
He just jumped higher.
(laughing)
I don't want to say the rest.
Signed, Evelyn.
And then in crayon, Steve is a baby.
I said I don't wanna say the rest, okay?
And incriminate myself.
March 22nd, 2001.
Dear Diary, wuz up?
Wuz. Up.
I feel bad right now, so
I'm gonna make this fast.
I forgot my assignment tablet at school.
Now my dad is going to be angry with me,
and I will have to write
stuff a million times.
(laughing)
I know I shouldn't forget stuff,
but it happens, you know?
Now I'll get a mark too.
Will I ever get anything right?
I just cried before I started writing.
Everyone thinks of me
as a happy, smart girl,
but sometimes I feel like nothing.
Well, bye.
Bad day, Evelyn.
Evelyn.
You are a happy, smart girl.
On the back here, I have
something, I think a pledge
that says I promise not
to eat any ice cream
or junk of any kind except
when it's meal time.
Signed, my full, I put my full name.
I think I was feeling a
little self-conscious.
I think this was around the time
I was eating way too many Pop-Tarts.
I was feeling a little bit fluffy.
Feel like a little like I
need to make a resolution.
So that doesn't have a date on it.
June 6th, 2001.
And I put a scale of the day.
I rated the day an 82.
Dear Diary, how's everything going?
I got an...
invitation.
Woo, I spelled that wrong.
I got an invitation to Amy's glamor party.
I might go,
but right now, I'm crying.
It's just not fair.
This is one of the reasons why.
Quotes.
"Evelyn, make your bed now."
"Oh, Steve, I made your bed for you."
That is what my mom says.
Sometimes when he calls me dumb,
and I go tell on him, I
have to apologize to him.
I underlined that.
It seems like I did something wrong,
but you have to remember, I didn't.
I am so angry right now.
I'll write later.
Signed.
And I signed my middle name.
My brother, five, calling me dumb.
That's rude.
I'm mad all over again.
Ooh, love it.
June 12th, 2001.
Dear Diary, hi.
It's 10:16 p.m.
and I'm heading to bed.
Is that a late bedtime?
I feel like that's a little late.
I had a wonderful day.
Mom let me spend my money.
I bought four packs of gum,
chips, soda and a notebook.
Well, that's my day.
Bye.
Signed, reclaiming my middle name.
I stand by those purchases, I do.
Ooh, speaking of chips and soda,
I found another weight
loss pledge, unfortunately.
I will go on a diet
and do as many sit-ups
as I can in one day.
Aw.
Tomorrow, July 26th, I will run from
my house
and back.
To where?
I am determined to lose weight.
I want to be skinny again,
but not so skinny.
Signed, me.
Is it bad that I still wanna lose weight?
And now that I have shared
with you the vulnerable
inner workings of baby Evelyn's mind,
a word from our sponsor.

Y'all already know I use Audible
almost exclusively to listen to memoirs.
I love hearing people
tell their own life story.
I suggest you listen to
The Last Black Unicorn
by Tiffany Haddish.
Yes, girl, she narrates her own book.
She ready.
All of that is in there, okay?
The things this woman has been through
and is still somehow able to laugh
and crack jokes is beyond.
Did y'all know she couldn't
really read until high school?
I'm writing my own
story as a nine year old
and--
*mind blown*
I usually got Audible
running in the background
as I am stuck in traffic or doing chores,
and there were a couple times
listening to Tiffany Haddish
where I had to stop what I was doing,
rewind, like, run it back.
Did that really just happen to you?
So to get started on your

visit Audible.com/Evelyn

And I will see you on
the Internet somewhere.
Bye.
