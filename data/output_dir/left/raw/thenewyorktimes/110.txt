1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
Not only is the president looking to take away

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:04,830
Brennan's security clearance

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,590
He's also looking into the clearances of Comey clapper Hayden rice and McCabe

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:16,979
These are all former top US officials President Trump says he wants their security clearances revoked

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,489
That's even though two of the officials including former FBI director James Comey. No longer have clearances

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,619
So why did he single out the group? Anyway one clue may be what they've said about him. I

7
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,209
think he has demonstrated time and time again that he lies the American people and that he is not fulfilling the

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,399
Responsibilities of the office of the presidency the United States used to be the defender of our European

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,559
Allies and to push back against the Russians the fact now that mr. Trump is aligning himself with mr

10
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,179
Putin so it's a concern he is giving aid and comfort to the enemy and it needs to stop

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,809
Oh, I have no confidence in a guy like Brett and I think he's a total lowlife

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,930
When the president tries to use the department justice is kind of a

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,690
private investigator a body that's

14
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:12,268
Not good for the country or institutions or under assault internally internally from the president exactly. Are you questioning his fitness?

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,129
Yes, I do. I have no confidence in clapper

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,949
You know clapper wrote me a beautiful letter

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,650
When I first went to office and it was really nice and then all of a sudden he's gone haywire

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,530
he has a habit of telling lies sometimes big sometimes casual and then insisting that the people around him repeat them and

19
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,990
believe them and that is

20
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,219
That stains any human is Donald Trump unfit to be President

21
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:49,079
Yes, I think he's morally unfit to be President, I think that James Comey was unfair to the people of this country

22
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,178
I think what he did was a disgrace. I think he goes down as the worst FBI director in history by far

23
00:01:54,179 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nobody close and I think I did the country a tremendous favor by firing him
