China has officially rolled out a plan to ban gasoline cars and this is of course a very ambitious goal that they have but they are extremely serious about it in fact the Deputy Minister of Industry and IT said that the ministry has started planning out a timeline for the end of petrol and diesel cars China just to give you a sense of how huge China is when it comes to the auto automotive market so 28 million cars last year that's a third of the 88 million cars and vans sold around the world so they're a huge player and so if they plan on banning gasoline vehicles in a certain amount of time that's gonna have an impact on all these other countries that buy foreign cars so if you're GM or Toyota or any of these car makers and all of a sudden one third of the entire market says we're not gonna buy those cars anymore you know what you're gonna do you're gonna stop producing them so this is enormous it has massive effect so Matt I don't often agree with the Chinese government but this one is going to help tremendously look but also proper context China now is the leading producer of greenhouse gases in the world we used to be the leading producer of greenhouse we used to be number one thank God we're not anymore but but remember China has four times as many people as the United States so now that they've become more industrialized they have all the cost quests for that and unfortunately those consequences are worldwide now in also it's it's local the pollution it's more direct I mean the greenhouse gases go and cause climate change which is has horrific consequences for all of us but the pollution they can see with their eyes yeah and and they and they breathe in every day and it is absolutely out of control in their major cities like Beijing and Shanghai so they're finally taking action on it and and it's significant action so this is very good news for the world right and it goes further than wanting to outlaw gasoline cars they are also ensuring that they build the necessary infrastructure for let's say electric vehicles so to give you an example they're on track to build a network of 800,000 electric vehicle charging points by the year's end so they want to make it incredibly convenient for those who do have electric vehicles to charge those cars and not have to worry about losing the electricity necessary for them to run and I love that I love how serious they are I love that they are you know contributing and and allocating the necessary necessary resources for that infrastructure we could learn a thing or two when it comes to that yes so last thing I wanted to say about that is that look there's plenty of corruption all across the world definitely in China but also here and if you watch the movie who killed the electric car you know that one of the things that the car companies did was they ruined that they've sometimes they would buy and then dismantle the infrastructure needed for electric cars here in the United States and that set this country back decades in getting better on climate change and I'm by the way also having cars that run on cheaper energy sources so and the oil companies must have a thrill about that too etcetera and so the corruption here allowed them to do that because here in America you could legally bribe politicians you just call it campaign donations or independent expenditures and they don't work for the public they work for private interests because they're financed by private interests so the giant car companies it did institutional corruption in the United States that set back the whole world now in China where there is plenty of corruption otherwise they're saying well you can't do that the government has just decided sad day for you we're getting rid of all those cars and yes we're gonna put in the infrastructure for electric cars so that we can make this possible help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
