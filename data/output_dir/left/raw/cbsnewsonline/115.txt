PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL 

100
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,227
PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS SOYBEANS. 

101
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,062
SOYBEANS IS A BIG DEAL. 

102
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,064
THE EUROPEAN UNION IS GOING TO 

103
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,134
START ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO BUY 

104
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:27,941
A LOT OF SOYBEANS. 

105
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,708
THEY ARE A TREMENDOUS MARKET. 

106
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,243
TO BUY A LOT OF SOYBEANS FROM 

107
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,277
OUR FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST, 

108
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:31,577
PRIMARILY. 

109
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:41,821
SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT. 

110
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,855
THIS WILL OPEN MARKETS FOR 

111
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,489
FARMERS AND WORKERS, INCREASE 

112
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,691
INVESTMENT, AND LEAD TO GREATER 

113
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,291
PROSPERITY IN BOTH UNITED 

114
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,326
STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

115
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,127
IT WILL ALSO MAKE TRADE FAIR 

116
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,796
AND MORE RECIPROCAL. 

117
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:51,698
MY FAVORITE WORD. 

118
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:51,998

OF OUR STRATEGIC COOPERATION 

122
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:01,541
WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY. 

123
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,742
THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO 

124
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:13,720
IMPORT MORE LIQUEFIED NATURALLY 

125
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,954
-- NATURAL GAS, LNG, FROM THE 

126
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,154
UNITED STATES, AND THEY ARE 

127
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,589
GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY BIG 

128
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:17,822
BUYER. 

129
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,024
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER 

130
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:19,459
FOR THEM. 

131
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,959
THEY ARE GOING TO BE A MASSIVE 

132
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,495
BUYER OF LNG, SO THEY WILL BE 

133
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,296
ABLE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR ENERGY 

134
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:23,529
SUPPLY. 

135
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,131
THEY WANT VERY MUCH TO DO THAT. 

136
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,132
WE HAVE PLENTY OF IT. 

137
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:26,966
THIRDLY, WE AGREED TODAY TO 

138
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,502
LAUNCH A CLOSE DIALOGUE ON 

139
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,837
STANDARDS IN ORDER TO EASE 

140
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:35,608

141
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,642
OBSTACLES, AND/COSTS

DRAMATICALLY. 

143
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:44,617
FOURTHLY WE AGREED TO JOIN 

144
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,885
FORCES TO PROTECT AMERICAN AND 

145
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,186
EUROPEAN COMPANIES FROM BETTER 

146
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:57,096
AND REALLY BETTER THAN EVER. 

147
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,331
WE HAVE NEVER DONE LIKE WE ARE 

148
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:58,564
DOING. 

149
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,698
I CAN SAY FROM THE STANDPOINT 

150
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,000
OF THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE 

151
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,201
NEVER DONE THIS WELL, BUT WE 

152
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,536
ARE GOING TO DO A LOT BETTER 

153
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,904
AFTER WE DO THIS DEAL  AND 

154
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,139
OTHER DEALS THAT WE ARE 

155
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,739
CURRENTLY WORKING ON. 

156
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,840
LIKEWISE, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS 

157
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,074
GOING TO DO BETTER, STRONGER, 

158
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:12,812
BIGGER. 

159
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,946
WE WILL, THEREFORE, WORK 

160
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,513
CLOSELY TOGETHER WITH LIKE-

161
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:15,448

DISTORTIONS CREATED BY STATE 

168
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,363
OWNED ENTERPRISES, AND 

169
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,265
OVERCAPACITY. 

170
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,799
WE HAVE DECIDED TO SET UP 

171
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:37,637
IMMEDIATELY AN EXECUTIVE 

172
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,438

176
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,144
ADVISORS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO 

177
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,679
CARRY OUT THIS JOINT AGENDA. 

178
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,616
IN ADDITION, IT WILL IDENTIFY 

179
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,451
SHORT-TERM MEASURES TO 

180
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,486
FACILITATE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGES 

181
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,423
AND SS EXISTING TARIFF MEASURES 

182
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,724
AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT 

183

TO THE BETTERMENT OF BOTH. 

184
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,902
WHILE WE ARE WORKING ON THIS, 

185
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,137
