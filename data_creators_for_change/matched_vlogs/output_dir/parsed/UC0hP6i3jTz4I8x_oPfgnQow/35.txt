is Ken insanity from America I now live
in the Philippines so yeah so we did a
video on his channel we did - never have

link will be down below okay so what are
we gonna do today for my video I'm going
to do my best to put some makeup on her
but this is your second time right yes
this is my second time to put makeup on
a girl so hopefully I don't fail so I
think yeah this is like knowledge about
me not really you should try your best
I will okay okay what is the first thing
that you have to do by the way you have
all the makeup here I'm guessing is this
very you can't tell me okay okay you
have to just let me do my thing
copy smell it don't laugh what are your
values freeze am I am I not supposed to
be doing this yeah it's just people a
Snickers I'll give you a hint
like step is there's no liquid you know
you're over there Oh guys she's
basically just just named the video on
Bella teaching Kenneth how to put makeup
that I even know what this is how do I
do
soft blurrier foundation isn't that fun
business foundation - that's powder
what slurry that's when you use to set
the foundation okay
hey don't tell me anymore okay I'll stop
you bet if I'm doing it wrong you can't
tell me can't even figure out how to
choose a brush use a brush I'm seeing
her face 2 hours guys I don't even let
me look for like 30 minutes early makes
me 5 minutes to take a shower for 5
minutes
takes me like an hour oh shoot I think
it for too much well then you have to
Glenroy me that small brush Oh
so obviously I'm supposed to use a
different brush because she said with
that small brush because it's gonna be
forever maybe I wanted to take her hey
close your eyes oh don't work out there
we go here's a second
I know didn't boxing's money
you said you applied too much now you're
playing boy yeah it's okay I'm on to you
I realized that I didn't have enough
sure Oh goddess my arms are so excited
but you should take a break for like ten
seconds so I just tweeted so hopefully
you get a lot of questions
guys she's literally saying that uh I
should stop 20,000 times boom it's not
good
might drop any after that you guys ever
do a dance over there
I mean it's good I don't dance so maybe
here I'll learn how to dance but we did
ask you for some suggestions for a
collab most of the suggestions where
dance covers or sorry you're saying
thumbs up because I'm supposed to yeah
guys she's not letting me guess where
you put go see there your cheeks
impressions my first impression she was
cool I mean we met at YouTube FanFest it
was my first time eating again yeah I
mean we spoke to kaya
yeah awesome cuz he was quiet based on
the color of this brush I'm thinking and
based on what you use most I'm thinking
it's one of these waves we wash is just
making fun of you why I have other
so my
where are you laughing I can't see
myself I don't have a piace context one
yeah too much I mean you gonna bet it's
more I mean I'm down if she doesn't want
to I mean I I want to learn how to dance
but yeah I think it's better now okay
next I'm guessing what is this I need
you oh it's powder grave each other shy
I'm shy
yeah why do you say that I know you're
just like kind of quiet sometimes you
also know I'm not mean yeah you are you
18 again that's route you're terrible
what no they're not rather already
I'm giving you make up for if you're
gonna go on TV or on stage because when
you're gonna make a break that's because
you're on stage like I'm done you're
done you're not done you have a lot of
steps to go no it's like nothing you put
nothing as I'm from America
