mayhem on one of the busiest roads in Miami minutes after the bridge collapsed emergency services airlifted some survivors to hospital but many more were thought to be trapped under 950 tons of concrete and metal I saw a young gentleman in a Honda and he still had life in him and there was nothing I could do he was squished and so he put his hand out and I it fell to the to the side and I knew he died at that dunk at least eight vehicles were crushed beneath the rubble I can assure you that our teams are still in rescue and search mode they're still working the debris pile we have search dogs in place we have technical listening devices and fiber optics where drive we're drilling holes into the pile to try to locate any viable case the pedestrian bridge had only been erected at Florida International University on Saturday it was due to be formally open next year now there are difficult days ahead our hard start here extended out to those that the victims that were actually able to be transported away as well as those that may not be walking away from the scene the bridge was installed using what's known as an accelerated construction method preassembled and installed piece by piece the design was supposed to reduce risk to workers and pedestrians and limit traffic disruption instead questions are being asked about if there's a criminal case to be answered the main focus here by the fire department obviously is to rescue people and that is what we're assisting with by controlling traffic assisting FHP with traffic for now and then we're on standby because as soon as those efforts are over our homicide Bureau will take the lead and investigating this tragedy that has occurred for now their rescue crews are searching for any signs of life but preparing for the worst Barbara and Gappa al-jazeera
