JUDGE JEANINE: THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST WRAPPING UP A RALLY IN TOPEKA, KANSAS. A REALLY VERY, VERY POSITIVE SPEECH. ON AN INCREDIBLE DAY WHERE WE WITNESSED HISTORY WITH AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE BEING CONFIRMED AND SWORN INTO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. IT'S THE CULMINATION OF ONE OF THE MOST OF CONTENTIOUS SUPREME COURT HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND THIS PRESIDENT OF COURSE IN TOPEKA, KANSAS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. A HUGE DAY FOR HIM, A HUGE DAY FOR THE REPUBLIC CANNING PARTY AS HE CONTINUES TO MARCH THROUGH THE COUNTRY TO GET PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THE CANDIDATE AND THEIR STATES JUST PRIOR TO THE MID-TERM. A FIRED UP PRESIDENT TRUMP CLEARLY DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST. JUST WRAPPING UP THAT RALLY SPEECH IN TOPEKA, KANSAS. WE HAVE A POLITICAL PANEL HERE. CPAC CHAIRMAN MATT SCHLAPP, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT DAN BONGINO TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN. I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE HUGE DAY THE PRESIDENT HAD. YOU CAN SENSE THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD. WE HAD ONE OF THE BIGGEST VOTES WE'LL EVER SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH, NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. YOU CAN SEE HOW INTERTWINED IT IS IN POLITICS. THE PRESIDENT IS AT THE RALLY. WHAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING THEY WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT? THE GREAT VICTORY AT THE SUPREME COURT. THE VICTORY WITH KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO MAKE REPUBLICANS' JOBS EASIER IN NOVEMBER. JUDGE JEANINE: DAN, YOU HAD A PANEL DISCUSSION WITH CHRIS HAHN TALKING ABOUT HOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED. THIS WEEK JUST AN INCREDIBLE WEEK TURNAROUND OF THE PRESIDENT IN MISSISSIPPI AND HOW HE CHAIRCHGD -AIRCHGD IRCHGD HCHGD HOWGD HOW HECHANGED THE CONVERSATO HOW HECHANGED THE CONVERSATN HOW HECHANGED THE CONVERSATB HOW HECHANGED THE CONVERSATC HOW HECHANGED THE CONVERSATK HOW HECHANGED THE CONVERSATT HOW HECHANGED THE CONVERSATO CHRISTINE FORD. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO CHRIS HAHN WHO ISN'T HERE TONIGHT? CHRIS HAHN DID SOMETHING LAST WEEK THAT DISGUSTED ME. HE ATTACKED AND JUMPED ON THIS LIBERAL TRAIN TO DESTROY THIS GOOD MAN. I WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED BY THAT. DAYS YOU A VINDICATION. CHRIS, NOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES. THAT'S WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY. IT'S LIKE "GOODWILL IT'S LIKE ""GODWILL IT'S LIKE ""GOOWILL IT'S LIKE ""GOODILL IT'S LIKE ""GOOD WL IT'S LIKE ""GOOD WILL HUNTING"." YOU LIKE APPLES? IT WAS A VINDICATION OF TRUMPISM. FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE BEEN IN A POLITICAL BOXING MATCH WITH THE LEFT WEARING BRASS KNUCKLES AND WE HAVE APPEALED TO THE MEDIA PLEASE TAKE THE KNUCKLES OFF. TRUMP TOOK THE GLOVES OFF. JUDGE JEANINE: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ALL MY VIEWERS, THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE CALLING IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES I'M SURE AFTER HE GETS OUT OF THE ARENA IN TOPEKA, KANSAS. WE'LL BE ABLE TO TALK TO HIM ON ONE OF THE MOST OF EXCITING DAYS OF HIS PRESIDENCY. WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN? BRETT KAVANAUGH WENT FROM A GREAT CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE THE A GUY INVOLVED IN GANG RAPES, A SEXUAL PREDATOR. SOME OF THE DARKEST DAYS THEY HAD TO BE OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE. NOW HE'S BACK UP AND JUST SWORN IN. AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. THE ONLY RON THAT HAPPENED IS BRETT KAVANAUGH WENT TO THAT HEARING IN THE SENATE AND CONNECTED WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HONESTLY AND AGGRESSIVELY PUSHED BACK ON THOSE SCURRILOUS CHARGES. IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT SEALED HIS FATE THAT HE WOULD BE CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT. PEOPLE WERE SO ENTHRALLED BY THE SHEER HONESTY AND EMOTION OF ALL THIS. EVERY AMERICAN FELT THE PAIN OF IT. THEY KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN SOMEONE GETS RAILROAD. IT WAS A GREAT INJUSTICE. JUDGE JEANINE: IT WASN'T JUST BEING RAILROAD, MATT. IT WAS ABOUT ELIMINATING THE RESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. IT WAS ABOUT A MOB RULE DICTATING THAT ALL WOMEN SHOULD BE BELIEVED AND MEN SHOULD JUST SHUT UP. MY FEAR WAS THAT LADY JUSTICE WAS NOT ONLY HAVING THE BANDAGE RIPPED OFF AND TOLD WHICH WAY TO GO, BUT SHE WAS BEING THROWN OUT OF THE GAME TOTALLY. AND THAT WAS FRIGHTENING TO A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE IN THE SYSTEM AND THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. IT MAY HAVE BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE CARED ABOUT A SUPREME COURT NOMINATION. WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE. THE LEFT HAS DONE THIS BEFORE. THEY LOB A GRENADE ON A POLITICAL BATTLEFIELD. IN THIS CASE IT WAS RACIST. WHICH WAS DISGUSTING. IN THE PAST A LESSER PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BACKED AWAY IMMEDIATELY AND SAID FOR THE BETTER OF THE COUNTRY, STEP ASIDE. TRUMP SAID NO, NOT TODAY. WHEN BRETT KAVANAUGH GOT UP THERE AND SAID NOT TODAY, NOT ON MY WATCH. I MAY NOT SIT ON THE SUPREME
