HELSINKI YESTERDAY WITH 
MELANIA. 
HE SPOKE ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS 
FROM THE MEETING. 
>> Reporter: WHAT'S YOUR GOAL 
FROM THE PUTIN MEETING? 
>> I WILL LET YOU KNOW AFTER 
THE MEETING. 
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY -- IT WAS 
MUTUALLY AGREED, LET'S HAVE A 
MEETING. 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING TO 
MEET. 
I BELIEVE IN MEETINGS, AND 
LOOK, I BELIEVE HAVING A 
MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS A 
GOOD THING, AND I THINK HAVING 
MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
CHINA WAS A VERY GOOD THING. 
I BELIEVE IT'S GOOD. 
HAVING MEETINGS WITH RUSSIA, 
CHINA, NORTH KOREA, I BELIEVE 
IN IT. 
NOTHING BAD WILL COME OUT OF 
IT, AND MAYBE SOME GOOD WILL 
COME OUT. 
I GO IN WITH LOW EXPECTATIONS. 
I'M NOT GOING IN WITH HIGH 
EXPECTATIONS. 
I DON'T REALLY -- I CAN'T TELL 
YOU WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, 
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I WILL 
BE ASKING FOR, AND WE WILL SEE 
IF SOMETHING COMES FOR IT. 
>> Reporter: THE RUSSIANS WHO 
WERE INDICTED, WOULD YOU ASK 
PUTIN TO SEND THEM HERE? 
>> WELL, I MIGHT. 
I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT BUT I 
WILL CERTAINLY ASK ABOUT IT. 
IT WAS DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION, AND THEY WERE 
DOING WHATEVER IT WAS DURING 
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, AND I 
HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING, OR 
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HACK INTO 
THE RNC, TOO, THE REPUBLICN 
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, BUT WE HAD 
MUCH BETTER DEFENSES, AND I 
HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT BY A NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE. 
WE HAD BETTER DEFENSES, AND 
THEY WOULDN'T. 
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 
HACKED. 
THEY HAD BAD DEFENSES, AND THEY 
WERE ABLE TO BE HACKED. 
I HEARD THEY WERE TRYING TO 
HACK THE REPUBLICANS, TOO, BUT, 
AND THIS MAY BE WRONG, BUT THEY 
HAD MUCH STRONGER DEFENSES. 
>> Reporter: LUKE COFFEY FROM 
WASHINGTON, THE DIRECTOR AT THE 
CONSERVATIVE HERITAGE CENTER 
FOR FOREIGN POLICY. 
GOOD TO TALK TO YOU, LUKE. 
>> Reporter: HI, GOOD MORNING. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOUR 
EXPECTATIONS ARE, YOUR ANALYSIS 
OF THIS MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS. 
>> WELL, I HAVE VERY LOW 
EXPECTATIONS AS WELL, AND IN 
PRINCIPLE, I THINK IT'S A 
POSITIVE THING THE TWO LEADERS 
ARE MEETING, AND I THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT IN DIPLOMACY TO HAVE 
HEADS OF STATE, BEING ABLE TO 
MEET WITH ONE ANOTHER FROM TIME 
TO TIME, AND I THINK PRESIDENT 
TRUMP NEEDS TO GO INTO THE 
MEETING WITH HIS EYES OPEN, AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS BEEN AROUND 
THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES, AND HE'S 
MET THREE DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS, 
BILL CLINTON, BUSH, AND 
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE PAST, 
AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING, 
AND NOTHING SINCE 1999 WHEN 
PRESIDENT PUTIN CAME TO POWER 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWS THAT 
HE CAN ACTUALLY BE A 
TRUSTWORTHY PARTNER FOR THE 
UNITED STATES. 
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP GOES INTO 
THIS IN A REALISTIC MANNER. 
>> LUKE, IS THERE AIDINGER IN 
-- IS THERE A DANGER IN 
APPROACHING A MEETING LIKE THIS 
WITHOUT AN AGENDA? 
>> Reporter: A LOT OF THE 
RHETORIC IS THAT IT'S NOT AS 
STRUCTURED. 
I THINK THE AMBASSADOR SAID 
IT'S A MEETING NOT AS 
STRUCTURED, BUT THERE'S SOME 
STRUCTURE BEHIND IT, AND SOME 
SORT OF, AT LEAST INFORMAL 
AGENDA, AND I THINK AT THIS 
POINT, IT'S PROBABLY OKAY, AND 
IT'S GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, IN 
TERMS OF SUMMITS A SHORTER 
SUMMIT, AND THEY WILL HAVE 
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF 
TOGETHER, JUST WITH 
TRANSATORS, AND INTERPRETERS, 
AND THEN, PARALLEL TO THAT, 
THERE'S ANOTHER MEET BETWEEN 
SECRETARY POMPEO AND HIS 
RUSSIAN COUNTERPART, AND THEN 
AFTER THOSE TWO MEETINGS RUN 
SIDE-BY-SIDE, THERE'S A WORKING 
LUNCH WHERE THE TWO SIDES WILL 
GET TOGETHER. 
I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT, UNDER 
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT'S MORE 
RELAXED, INFORRAL FORMAT THAT 
IS APPROPRIATE. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING, THE 
PRESIDENT ALSO SUGGESTED THIS 
MEETING WILL BE, AT LEAST THE 
WAY HE SEES IT, HE ALSO HAS 
VERY LOW EXPECTATIONS, BUT 
THERE'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS OUT 
THERE, THAT SUGGESTS, VLADIMIR 
PUTIN AND THE RUSSIANS HAVE 
ALREADY GOTTEN A LOT OUT OF 
THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
UNITED STATES, SUCH AS IT 
EXCITES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO  SHOW THEY HAVE THE 
PRESIDENT SUGGESTING RUSSIA BE 
REINSTATED FOR WHAT WOULD BE 
THE U8. 
IF YOU'RE THE RUSSIANS, AREN'T 
YOU ALREADY SEEING WHATEVER 
THIS IS, IT'S A FORMALITY, A 
LOT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER 
THE LAST YEAR OR YEAR AND A 
HALF HAS BEEN A WIN THE WAY THE 
RUSSIANS SEE IT. 
>> Reporter: CERTAINLY SOME OF 
THE RHETORIC FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE DOES HELP THE RUSSIAN 
NARRATIVE OF THE WEST BEING 
FRACTURED, AND THE WEST BEING 
DISUNITED, BUT IF YOU MOVE 
BEYOND THE RHETORIC, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS BEEN SURPRISINGLY 
TOUGH AGAINST RUSSIA, AND, IN 
FACT, I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PARADOXES OF 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SO 
FAR. 
HE HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE 
TOUGHEST PRESIDENT ON RUSSIA, 
IN TERMS OF POLICIES, SINCE 
RONALD REAGAN. 
HE HAS PROVIDED ADVANCED 
WEAPONS TO UKRAINE AND GEORGIA, 
SOMETHING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT DO FOR 
8 YEARS, AND EVEN WITH HIS 
WHINING AND COMPLAINING, AND 
RIGHTFULLY SO, OF EUROPE'S LACK 
OF DEFENSE SPENDING, THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED 
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE U.S. 
SPENDS ON EUROPEAN DEFENSE BY 
40 PERCENT FROM THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
WHILE SOME OF THE RHETORIC IS 
ALARMING, THE ACTUALLY POLICIES 
OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION ARE 
VERY SOUND ON RUSSIA. 
>> WHY USE THE RHETORIC? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. 
I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
PROBABLY LIKES THE ATTENTION, 
AND IT DRIVES THE NEWS CYCLE, 
AND THE AGENDA, AND HE LIKES TO 
-- HE FANCIES HIMSELF AS A 
GREAT DEAL MAKER, AND HE LIKES 
TO THROW THINGS OUT THERE TO 
SEE WHAT WILL STICK AHEAD OF 
ANY TALKS OR NEGOTIATIONS, AND 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING TODAY, AND, YOU KNOW, 
ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE, THE HEAD 
OF THE NATO SUMMIT, THE OPENING 
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS ON THE GAS PIPELINE, GOING 
DIRECTLY FROM RUSSIA TO 
GERMANY, BYPASSING ALL OTHER 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS CONTROVERSIAL 
ACROSS EUROPE, AND IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN 
TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY AND 
SUPPORTS VERY MUCH, AND HIM 
BLASTING THAT IN THE OPENING 
STAGES OF THE NATO SUMMIT WAS 
NOT FOLLOWING THE MOSCOW 
PLAYBOOK AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. 
>> YOU WROTE A PIECE FOR THE 
HERITAGE FOUNDATION WEBSITE, 
AND JUST TO SORT OF POINT OUT, 
VLAD, YOU KNOW, SORT OF POINTED 
OUT, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION IS 
DEDICATED TO BUILDING A 
CONSERVATIVE PUBLIC POLICY, AND 
WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE 
YOU'RE COMING FROM, BUT IN THE 
PIECE YOU POSTED ON THE 
WEBSITE, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS, OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION, AND THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION, AND WHERE DO 
YOU THINK THE TWO 
ADMINISTRATIONS FAILED? Ãº>> WEL 
2001, SOON AFTER MEETING PUTIN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE LOOKED 
INTO HIS EYES AND SAW A MAN WHO 
WAS HONORABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY, 
AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A 
HUGE ERROR IN JUDGMENT, AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS A FORMER 
K.G.B. 
OFFICER PROBABLY LOOKED INTO 
HIS EYES AND SAW A CASE NUMBER, 
AND GEORGIA HAD BEEN INVADED, 
AND 20% OF THE COUNTRY WAS 
OCCUPIED, AND THERE WERE 
ADVANCED CYBER ATTACKS. 
AND OBAMA, 7 OR 8 MONTHS AFTER 
THE INVASION OF GEORGIA, 
SECRETARY CLINTON PUSHING 
AWKWARDLY AND SYMBOLICALLY, THE 
RUSSIAN RESET BUTTON, AND THAT 
RESET HAS ESSENTIALLY TURNED 
INTO A REGRET BY THE NEXT TERM, 
RUSSIA INVADING CRIMEA AND 
STRIKING A WAR IN UKRAINE. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS TAKEN 
MEASURES TO DESTABILIZE OR 
UNDERMINE AMERICA AND ITS 
ALLIES. 
I HOPE PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL 
LEARN FROM THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS  ON THIS. 
>> DO YOU THINK HE WILL LOOK AT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SEE A CASE 
NUMBER? 
AT TIMES HE DOES NOT EDIT 
HIMSELF, IN TERMS OF  
EXPRESSING HIS EMOTIONS. 
DO YOU THINK HE'S AN EASY MARK 
FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN? 
>> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN 
EXPERIENCE IN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN IN DEALING 
WITH THE MAJOR POLITICAL 
ISSUES. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS, AS I SAID 
EARLIER, HAS BEEN AROUND THE 
BLOCK. 
HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN HIGH-
LEVEL, HIGH-STAKES NEGOTIATIONS 
FOR YEARS, FOR DECADES, AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NEW ON THE 
SCENE, AND LIKE I SAID, HE 
SEEMS HIMSELF AS A GREAT DEAL 
MAKER,  BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT 
SORT OF DEAL HE WILL GET FROM 
PRESIDENT PUTIN BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS NOT GOING TO 
GO INTO THE MEETING, WILLING TO 
GIVE EVERYTHING ANYTHING OR 
ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER, 
UNLESS -- GIVE EVERYTHING OR 
ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER AWAY, 
UNLESS IT BENEFITS RUSSIA. 
>> PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS 
HAVE MADE ERRORS AND MISTAKES 
WITH THE RUSSIANS, AND THIS IS 
THE THIRD PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN HAS SEEN, AND HE'S 
DEFINITELY BEEN AROUND THE 
BLOCK. 
A FORMER KBG SPY, AND HE'S WELL 
VERSED IN POLITICS, AND HERE'S 
ANOTHER QUESTION, THEN, THE 
FACT THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP GOES TO MEET 
WITH KIM JONG-UN, COMES OUT OF 
THAT MEETING, AND NOW SAYS, WE 
ARE GOING TO BE SUSPENDING 
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH SOUTH 
KOREA AND THE JAPANESE IN THE 
REGION, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 
PYONGYANG HAS BEEN AFTER FOR 
MANY, MANY YEARS. 
AS YOU POINT OUT, VLADIMIR 
PUTIN IS NOT GIVING ANYTHING 
AWAY, AND THE FACT IT APPEARS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REALLY, FOR 
WHATEVER REASON, REALLY WANTING 
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO LIKE HIM, YOU 
POINT OUT, HE'S BEEN TOUGH ON 
SANCTIONS AND TOUGH IN POINTING 
OUT THE ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO 
GERMANY AND THE PIPELINE AND 
THE OIL BEING SOLD, BUT HE DOES 
APPEAR TO WANT PUTIN TO LIKE 
HIM. 
IN JUST HAVING THE MEETING, 
DOES IT APPEAR ON THE FACE OF 
IT, IT'S A WIN? 
THE PRESIDENT HAS REFUSED TO 
PUBLICALLY, AT LEAST, CONDEMN 
ANYTHING THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 
HAS DONE. 
ALL THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED, 
AND THEY ARE THINGS THAT PAST 
PRESIDENTS SHOULD HAVE, 
PERHAPS, NOT LET HAPPEN, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN WILLING 
TO CRITICIZE VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
AGAIN, THERE'S A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE FROM THE RHETORIC OF 
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TWITTER 
ACCOUNT AND WHAT THE POLICIES 
ARE ON THE GROUND. 
IF I WAS A UKRAINIAN SOLDIER, I 
WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE TANK 
MISSILE RATHER THAN A NICE 
TWEET. 
I TRY TO LOOK OBJECTIVELY AND 
SAY THERE'S A REASON HE'S 
TWEETING AND THE THINGS HE'S 
SAYING AND SAYING THE THINGS 
HE'S SAYING. 
IT'S UP TO DEBATE WHY HE'S 
DOING THIS, BUT WHEN THE RUBBER 
HITS THE ROAD, THE POLICIES 
COMING OUT OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION ON RUSSIA HAVE 
BEEN TOUGH, AND THEY ARE VERY 
MUCH WELCOMED, BUT YOUR POINT 
ABOUT, AGAIN, FOCUSING ON THE 
LACK OF EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THE 
TWO LEADERS ON THE BIGGER 
ISSUES IS VERY IMPORTANT, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF 
THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING THAT IS 
SCHEDULED, AT LEAST, TO LAST 
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. 
THIS IS THE ASPECT OF THE 
SUMMIT THAT CONCERNS ME THE 
MOST. 
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP COMES OUT, 
AFTER THE SUMMIT, AND REPEATS 
WHAT HE SAID IN SINGAPORE, 
ABOUT U.S. MILITARY EXERCISES 
BEING SUSPENDED, BECAUSE THEY 
ARE PROVOCATIVE, IT WOULD BE A 
DISASTER. 
NATO'S COLLECTIVE DEFENSE IS 
NECESSITATED BY THE LEVELS OF 
READINESS AND DEFENDING THE 
TERRITORY OF MILITARY STATES. 
THE EXERCISES ARE NOT 
PROVOCATIVE BECAUSE NATO IS A 
DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE. 
>> LUKE, BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, 
I WONDER IF, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS AN 
EXPERIENCED GEOPOLITICAL 
STRATEGIST, AND PREVIOUS 
PRESIDENTS WITHOUT EXPERIENCE 
HAVE COME ACROSS THE RUSSIAN 
LEADERS, MOST FAMOUSLY KENNEDY, 
COMING OUT OF THE FIRST MEETING 
SAYING HE WAS MAN HANDLED, BUT 
AT LEAST, WITH PRIOR PRESIDENTS 
F YOU LOOK AT  -- IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE CANVAS OF HISTORY, THEY 
WERE STRONG IN THEIR 
CONVICTIONS. 
PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS NOT AS 
WELL VERSED EITHER IN DEALING 
WITH THE RUSSIANS, BUT HE HAD 
THE STRENGTH OF HIS 
CONVICTIONS, AND I WONDER IF 
YOU, AND IT'S JUST A QUESTION 
BECAUSE OF THIS INTERESTING 
DISCUSSION, IF YOU OR ANYONE 
KNOWS HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP FEELS 
ABOUT RUSSIA, THE THREAT OF 
RUSSIA, SUCH AS IT EXITS, OR 
NOT. 
ARE WE ABLE TO DISCERN WHAT HIS 
CONVICTIONS ARE LIKE PRESIDENT 
REAGAN ABOUT THE SOVIET UNION 
OR PRESIDENT KENNEDY ABOUT THE  
SOVIET EXPANSION? 
>> THE WAY HE TWEETS, RUSSIA IS 
DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE 
INVESTIGATION FOR HIM. 
>> HE CALLS IT A WITCH HUNT, 
EVEN THOUGH ON FRIDAY 12 
RUSSIANS WERE INDICTED BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF JUSTICE FOR 
INTERFERING WITH OUR ELECTIONS, 
AND HE SURPRISINGLY SAYS IT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
. 
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK, 
IT'S UNANIMOUS AMONG EVERY 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AND 
APPARATUS IN THE UNITED STATES, 
RUSSIA MEDDLED IN THE ELECTION, 
AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO 
UNTIL THEY ARE PUSHED BACK. 
THEY WILL DO SO AGAINST OUR 
ALLIES AND THEIR DOMESTIC 
ELECTIONS AS WELL, AND THIS 
SHOULD BE ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP RAISES IN 
HELSINKI, WITHOUT A DOUBT, BUT, 
AGAIN, GOING BACK TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S CONVICTIONS AND HIS 
BELIEFS ON RUSSIA, WELL, YOU 
LOOK AT THE POLICIES COMING OUT 
OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, AND 
SOMEONE IS SIING OFF ON 
THESE, AND HE IS TAKING TOUGHER 
MEASURES THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA 
OR PRESIDENT BUSH BEFORE HIM 
HAS ON RUSSIA. 
WHERE WILL THIS LEAD US? 
>> WHAT WILL MATERIALIZE 
BECAUSE OF THIS? 
>> AND BECAUSE OF THE HELSINKI 
MEETING? 
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
RIGHT NOW, OVERALL, MOVING 
BEYOND THE RHETORIC F YOU  -- 
RHETORIC, IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
POLICIES, THE UNITED STATES IS 
IN A GOOD SPOT. 
>> WE APPRECIATE IT, AND WE 
WILL SPEAK TO YOU LATER. 
>>> WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS, 
AND WE WERE JUST SHOWING LIVE 
PICTURES EARLIER OF PRESIDENT 
PUTIN ARRIVING IN HELSINKI.

>> Reporter: AFTER 10 YEARS OF 
MARRIAGE, THE A-LIST POWER 
COUPLE ANNOUNCED THEIR 
SEPARATION IN 2015, FILING FOR 
DIVORCE LAST YEAR, BUT -- 
>> THE PUBLIC WAS AND STILL IS 
OBSESSED WITH YOUR PRIVATE 
LIFE. 
WHAT HAS THAT BEEN LIKE FOR YOU 
GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE AND 
HAVING EVERY MOMENT OF THAT 
PLAYED OUT ON THE COVER OF THE 
MAGAZINES? 
>> WHAT I THINK THAT I HAVE 
LEARNED IS THAT SCRUTINY ON 
YOUR PRIVATE LIFE PUTS A 
PRESSURE TO MAKE SOMETHING 
HAPPEN. 
YOU FEEL A PRESSURE TO HURRY UP 
AND GET MARRIED BECAUSE YOU 
THINK IT WILL END THE ARE THEY 
ENGAGE? 
OR NOT? 
>> THAT'S TRUE IN THE REVERSE 
AS WELL, IF THE TABLOIDS DECIDE 
THERE'S TROUBLE IT CAN CREATE 
TROUBLE, BUT TO BE HONEST, 
PUBLIC SCRUTINY, EVERYONE SAYS 
YOU HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS 
IN PUBLIC. 
THE PUBLIC IS NOT HARD. 
WHAT IS HARD IS GOING THROUGH 
IT. 
>> Reporter: DO YOU FIND YOU 
CAN CAN TUNE OUT FROM ALL OF 
THAT? 
>> I DON'T LOOK AT IT. 
I HAD TO REALLY GET SERIOUS 
WITH MYSELF AND SAY THIS IS NOT 
HEALTHY. 
NOBODY SHOULD SEE PICTURES OF 
THEMSELVES THAT THE PAPARAZZI 
HAS TAKEN. 
YOU CAN IN THE MORNING, EITHER 
BE MAKING BREAKFAST FOR YOUR 
KIDS, MAKING THEIR LUNCHBOXES, 
OR YOU CAN BE GETTING PAPARAZZI 
READY, AND SO, YOU KNOW, I KNOW 
WHICH WAY I'M GOING TO GO. 
>> IN HERE A POND THERE, AND MY 
SISTERS AND I CAUGHT OUR FIRST 
FISH IN IT. 
>> Reporter: YOU WON'T FIND ANY 
PAPARAZZI OUT HERE. 
>> MAMA COULD SURE FRY GOOD 
CHICKEN. 
>> YEAH, SHE COULD. 
>> MOM COULD MAKE A SQUIRREL 
TASTE REALLY GOOD. 
>> THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING. 
>> Reporter: IS THAT IN THEORY? 
OR IN PRACTICE? 
>> THAT'S IN PRACTICE. 
WE ATE SQUIRRELS UNTIL -- I 
WILL AGAIN IF I HAVE TO. 
>> Reporter: IN OKLAHOMA, JUST 
EAST OF TULSA, GARNER RECENTLY 
PURCHASED THE FARM WHERE HER 
MOTHER GREW UP AND HER UNCLE 
ROBERT STILL LIVES. 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE 
GROWING? 
>> BLUEBERRIES, KALE, AND 
PERSIMMONS. 
>> Reporter: IT'S A SITE TO 
GROW PRODUCE FOR ONCE UPON A 
FARM, THE ORGANIC FRESH BABY 
FOOD COMPANY SHE RECENTLY 
COFOUNDED. 
WHY WAS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO 
HAVE IT ON THIS FARM? 
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IF I HAD 
ANY IDEA HOW HAPPY IT WOULD 
MAKE MY MOM TO BE PART OF 
BRINGING THIS LITTLE FARM BACK 
TO LIFE, I WOULD HAVE DONE IT 
TEN TIMES OVER, BUT YOUR FAMILY 
JUST HAS A CONNECTION TO THE 
LAND THAT HAS RAISED THEM, AND 
I WANTED THE BUSINESS CONNECTED 
TO MY FAMILY. 
>> Reporter: FRESH FOOD WAS A 
KEY PART OF HER CHILDHOOD. 
>> MOM DID NOT BELIEVE IN 
PROCESSED FOOD, AND EVERYTHING 
WE HAD WAS HOME MADE. 
IF IT WAS A COOKIE, IT WAS A 
HOME MADE COOKIE. 
>> Reporter: THAT DOESN'T 
ALWAYS MEAN IT WAS EATEN. 
>> SHE WAS KIND OF PICKY. 
>> I WAS THE PICKIEST. 
I WAS A NIGHTMARE. 
>> SHE LIVED ON PEANUT BUTTER 
AND HONEY, AND SHE WILL SAY HOW 
DID YOU STAND ME, MOTHER? 
>> Reporter: NOW GARNER'S GOAL, 
SHE SAYS, IS TO GET HOME MADE 
FOOD INTO THE HOMES OF BUSY 
PARENTS. 
>> IT'S AN OPTION FOR MOMS WHO 
MIGHT BE TOO BUSY TO MAKE THEIR 
OWN FRESH FOOD FOR THEIR KIDS, 
THAT DAY OR EVER, AND WE MAKE 
IT FRESH FROM THE EARTH, JUST 
AT THE GROCERY STORE. 
>> Reporter: IS THIS SOMETHING 
YOU HAVE THREE MEALS A DAY OR 
SNACK? 
>> IT DEPENDS. 
BABIES EAT DIFFERENT THINGS AT 
DIFFERENT TIMES. 
YOU WILL SEE SOME DAY, BUT YOU 
-- 
>> Reporter: NACHOS AND MILK 
SHAKE. 
>> YOU WILL LEARN. 
I WILL HELP YOU WHEN YOU GET 
THERE. 
>> Reporter: IT'S BEEN A BUSY 
YEAR FOR THE 46-YEAR-OLD 
GARNER. 
>> I NEED YOU TO HEAR THIS. 
YOU ARE STILL YOU, SIMON. 
>> Reporter: IN ADDITION TO A 
CELEBRATED TURN IN THE MOVIE 
"LOVE SIMON," SHE'S RETURNING 
TO TV, JUST WRAPPING UP THE 
SHOOTING OF "CAMPING," AND 
SHE'S BACK IN ACTION IN 
"PEPPERMINT" THE REVENGE FILM 
THAT WILL PREMIER THIS FALL. 
BUT BACK IN HER BACKYARD GARDEN 
IN LOS ANGELES, BLUEBERRIES ARE 
IN SEASON. 
SHE GROWS KALE AND LEMONS, 
RAISES CHICKENS, AND KEEPS BEES 
FOR HONEY, FOOD FOR HER OWN 
FAMILY, HER WAY OF CONNECTING 
TO HOW ONCE UPON A TIME, SHE 
WAS RAISED. 
>> IT JUST MAKES YOU HAPPY TO 
PICK SOMETHING AND EAT IT. 
>> Reporter: OH, YEAH. 
WOW! 
>> I MEAN, THEY ARE SO GOOD. 
>> I MADE A BLUEBERRY CRUMBLE 
THE OTHER NIGHT FOR DESSERT. 
>>> TIME FOR A TASTE OF SUMMER, 
SHANGHAI STYLE, SERVED UP BY 
BEN TRACY. 
>> Reporter: IN THIS 
HYPERMODERN METROPOLIS, THE 
PRESENT OFTEN LOOKS LIKE THE 
FUTURE. 
DOWN JUST ABOUT ANY STREET, 
THERE'S SIGNS OF SHANGHAIING'S 
CULINARY HISTORY. 
SOUP DUMPINGS STEAMING ON THE 
SIDEWALK HERE. 
>> YES. 
>> Reporter: CRYSTAL MOE IS A 
FOOD WRITER IN SHANGHAIING. 
SHE TOOK US TO ONE OF HER MOST 
FAMOUS EATERIES FOR SOUP 
DUMPLINGS. 
A HUNGRY CROWD WAS LINED UP OUT 
THE DOOR. 
>> IT'S THE KIND OF 
NEIGHBORHOOD PLACE THAT ARE 
STILL IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IN 
SHANGHAIING. 
>> Reporter: SOUP DUMPLINGS 
BEGINNING LIKE MOST DUMPLINGS 
DO, THE DOUGH IS ROLLED OUT AND 
PRESSED INTO LITTLE CIRCLES. 
THE FILLING, USUALLY PORK, IS 
PLACED INSIDE. 
THEY ARE CAREFULLY FOLDED BY 
HAND, CREATING THE PERFECT 
DUMPLING DIMPLES. 
THE HIGHER NUMBER OF FOLDS, UP 
T 22, IS CONSIDERED A HIGHER 
QUALITY DUMPING. 
>> HOW DO YOU GET THE SOUP? 
THERE? 
>> Reporter: IT'S A JELLY PORK 
OIL CUT INTO THE MIXTURE. 
WHEN THEY ARE STEAMED, IT 
BECOMES LIQUID, CREATING THE 
SOUP INSIDE. 
I'M SURE IT'S NOT HEALTHY. 
>> DEPENDS ON THE DIET YOU'RE 
ON. 
>> Reporter: THE TASTY OF THE 
SOUP DUMPLINGS IS NOT IN 
QUESTION, BUT THE ORIGINS ARE 
DEBATABLE. 
MOST AGREE THE DUMPLINGS WERE 
INVITED IN THE 1870s.  
A DUMPLING MAKER STEAMED IT IN 
THE ROUND BAMBOO BASKETS, AND 
THEY WERE A HIT. 
IT TRANSLATES LITERALLY AS 
SMALL BASKET BUN. 
DECADES LATER, ANOTHER 
SHANGHAIING CHEF MOVED TO 
TAIWAN, HIRED BY A COOKING OIL 
STORE. 
THAT BRAND HAS MADE THE SOUP 
DUMPLING A HOUSEHOLD NAME ALL 
OVER THE WORLD WITH DOZENS OF 
RESTAURANTS INCLUDING SEVERAL 
ON THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>> THE SOUP DUMPLING IS A MUST-
TRY FOOD IN SHANGHAI. 
>> Reporter: FOOD TOURS LIKE 
THIS ONE MAKE IT THE FIRST 
STOP, EVEN IF TOURISTS ARE NOT 
SURE OF WHAT TO MAKE OF IT. 
>> IT'S SORT OF LIKE A PASTA 
WITH A MEAT BALL INSIDE. 
>> Reporter: EATING THE 
DELICATE DOUGH FILLED WITH 
PIPING HOT SOUP TAKES PRACTICE. 
>>Reporter: I NEED YOU TO SHOW 
ME HOW TO EAT THIS. 
I'M SURE I'M NOT DOING IT 
RIGHT. 
>> I HOPE YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED 
TO YOUR SHIRT. 
TAKE A LITTLE BITE OUT OF THE 
SKIN AT THE TOP. 
>> THERE YOU GO. 
AND THEN YOU CAN SUCK OUT THE 
SOUP. 
NOW YOU HAVE A SAFE DUMPLING TO 
EAT. 
>> Reporter: IT'S NOT GOING TO 
BURN MY MOUTH. 
>> NO, YOU CAN JUST DO IT IN 
ONE. 
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE KIND 
OF FOOD I COULD EAT WHEN I'M 
NOT EVEN HUNGRY. 
YOU JUST KEEP EATING BECAUSE 
IT'S SO GOOD. 
>> IT'S SO GOOD. 
>>> GOOD MORNING, I'M JANE

>>> PERFECT HARMONY IS THE GOAL 
OF EVERY CHORUS DIRECTOR, BUT 
FEW HAVE EVER ACHIEVED IT ON

WHICH THEY ALL ARE NOW. 
RETIRED HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER, 
ROBERT MOORE LIKES TO POUR OVER 
THE LIST OF ALL 900 OF HIS 
FORMER STUDENTS.

WHAT HE WOULDN'T GIVE TO RELIVE 
THOSE TIMES. 
>> WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO GET 
THOSE KIDS BACK TOGETHER? 
>> Reporter: THERE'S NO WAY 
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 
>> NO. 
 Reporter: ACTUALLY, I WAS 
PLAYING DUMB. 
THERE'S VERY MUCH A WAY, AND IT 
WAS ALREADY IN THE WORKS.

>> Reporter: IT WOULD BE. 
>> Reporter: UNBEKNOWNST TO MR. 
MOORE A SMALL GROUP OF STUDENTS 
HAVE BEEN PLOTTING A SURPRISE. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT A LIVE 
LOOK RIGHT NOW AS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S MOTORCADE ARRIVES AT 
THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE IN 
HELSINKI. 
WE ARE MINUTES AWAY FROM THE 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
HE'S ARRIVING, AND WE EXPECT A 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM CBS NEWS AT 
THE MOMENT HE STEPS OUT OF THE 
VEHICLE, BUT, OF COURSE -- 
>>> THIS IS A CBS NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT. 
I'M GAYLE KING WITH JOHN 
DICKERSON AND MARGARET BEN 
THEN. 
PRESIDENT -- BRENNAN. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ARRIVING IN 
HELSINKI FOR HIS MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE HAS 
LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE 
MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN 
LEADER. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN URGED 
TO CONFRONT HIM ON SEVERAL TOP 
PICKS INCLUDING THE INDICTMENT 
OF 12 RUSSIAN MILITARY OFFICERS 
ACCUSED OF HACKING THE 
COMPUTERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY OFFICIALS DURING THE LAST 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
>> WHITE PRESIDENT IS -- WHILE 
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO 
DIMINISH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THE MEETING, IT'S DRAWING 
ATTENTION FROM AROUND THE 
WORLD. 
NORAH O'DONNELL IS LEADING OUR 
COVERAGE. 
>> Reporter: A BIT OF DRAMA 
THIS MORNING AS THE SUMMIT IS 
ALREADY AN HOUR BEHIND 
SCHEDULE, AND IT WAS PRESIDENT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN OF RUSSIA WHO 
KEPT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAITING. 
HE WAS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE AN 
HOUR AGO, BUT AS PRESIDENT 
PUTIN LIKES TO DO, HE LIKES TO 
KEEP THE OTHER WORLD LEADERS 
WAITING, AND NOW YOU CAN SEE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVING HERE, 
JUST ABOUT AN HOUR LATE, AND 
IT'S A HISTORIC MEETING. 
OF COURSE TRUMP IS THE FOURTH 
U.S. PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH 
PUTIN, BUT NEVER BEFORE IN 
HISTORY HAS A U.S. PRESIDENT 
SPENT TIME ALONE WITH THE 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, AND IN FACT 
ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
SCHEDULE, THEY HAVE BUDGETED AN 
HOUR AND A HALF FOR TRUMP AND 
PUTIN TO MEET, ALONE, JUST THE 
TWO OF THEM WITH TRANSLATORS. 
THE QUESTION THAT MANY HAVE 
THIS MORNING, WHAT IS ON THE 
AGENDA? 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DISCUSS? 
WILL PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVER A 
STRONG  MESSAGE TO THE RUSSIAN 
LEADER TO CUT IT OUT FOR WHAT 
THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AND 
ACCORDING TO EXPERTS WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING NOW. 
MAJOR, WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED SO 
FAR? 
>> IT'S A HIGH VISIBILITY, HIGH 
COVERAGE EVENT. 
TWO QUESTIONS AT THE FRONT END 
ARE SIGNIFICANT, WHAT TO CALL 
IT, AND WHAT TO MAKE OF IT. 
>> DAYS BEFORE WE GOT TO 
HELSINKI, SENIOR OFFICIALS 
LOBBIED WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS 
AND BADGERED THEM, DON'T CALL 
IT A SUMMIT. 
JUST CALL IT A MEETING.
ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS, IT WAS 
REPEATED, AND YET, YESTERDAY 
WH 
IT. 
WHAT AMERICAN INTERESTS WILL 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADVANCE HERE IN 
HELSINKI? 
THE PRESIDENT FOR WHATEVER 
REASON HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY 
VAGUE ABOUT HIS AGENDA WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND HE'S BEEN 
UNCLEAR HOW SIGNIFICANTLY HE 
WILL PRESS THAT ISSUE OF 
ELECTION MEDDLING IN 2016 AND 
WHAT, AS YOU SAID, NORAH, THE 
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE SAID IS GOING ON 
IN PREPARATION FOR 2018. 
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA? 
THAT MUCH WE DON'T KNOW, AND HE 
HAS SAID HE WANT THE TO TAKE 
STOCK OF VLADIMIR PUTIN FACE-TO-
FACE IN THAT HOUR AND  -- FACE-
TO-FACE. 
IN THAT HOUR AND A HALF, THEY 
WILL HAVE TIME TO DO THAT. 
IN BRUSSELS, SOME WERE 
CONCERNED WHAT WILL COME OF THE 
MEETING. 
THERE'S SOME ANXIETY IN EUROPE 
THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN IN THE ONE-
ON-ONE ENCOUNTER MAY GET THE 
BEST OF THE PRESIDENT. 
>> MAJOR GARRETT, WE ARE 
EXPECTING TO HEAR BRIEF REMARKS 
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AS THEY MEET 
HERE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
PALACE, BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE 
ONE-ON-ONE MEETING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY 
SPOKEN THIS MORNING, BLAMING 
U.S. FOOLISHNESS IN HIS WORDS, 
SAYING U.S.-RUSSIA RELATIONS 
HAVE NEVER BEEN WORSE, AND 
ELIZABETH PALMER HAS REPORTED 
FROM MOSCOW FOR YEARS, AND HOW 
IS THE RUSSIAN MEDIA ALIGNING? 
>> THEY DEEP STATE 
INTERFERENCE, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WOULD BE HERE OFFERING NORMAL 
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 
SO IT'S REALLY PLAYED INTO  
PUTIN'S HANDS EVEN BEFORE THIS 
SUMMIT GETS GOING. 
>> WHAT'S THE BEST CASE 
SCENARIO FOR PRESIDENT PUTIN AS 
HE COMES INTO THE SUMMIT. 
>> HE'S ALREADY WON. 
HE'S COMING OFF THIS TRIUMPHANT 
WORLD CUP SOCCER TOURNAMENT, 
THE LARGEST SPORTING EVENT IN 
THE WORLD. 
HE HOSTED IT, IT WAS FLAWLESS, 
HE'S ON A ROLL AND NOW HE'S 
BEING SHOWN ON TV ALL OVER THE 
WORLD SITTING DOWN WITH THE 
U.S. PRESIDENT, SIGNALLING THAT 
HE'S THE MAN TO BRING RUSSIA IN 
FROM THE COLD SO HE DOESN'T 
HAVE TO WALK OUT OF THIS WITH 
ANYTHING. 
HE'S ALREADY GOT A GREAT  
VICTORY. 
>> IT IS INCREDIBLE TO THINK IN 
ADDITION TO THIS UNPRECEDENTED 
PRIVATE MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO 
PRESIDENTS, THERE WILL ALSO BE 
A PRESS CONFERENCE. 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A JOINT  
U.S.-RUSSIAN PRESS CONFERENCE 
WITH PUTIN IN MORE THAN A 
DECADE BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA 
REFUSED TO DO THAT. 
DOES THAT GIVE PUTIN SOME SORT 
OF STANDING THAT HE'S NOT HAD 
IN THE PAST DECADE? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
IT ADDS TO HIS STATURE AND HE'S 
VERY GOOD AT PRESS CONFERENCE, 
HE LOVES TO TALK. 
WE SAW HIM LAST NIGHT BEFORE 
THE SOCCER GAME, SO RELAXED, 
HE'S GOING TO BE ENJOYING THAT 
MOMENT AND IF HISTORY TEACHES 
ANYTHING, HE'S GOING TO BRING 
IT OFF WITH BRIO. 
>> WE HAVE AN HISTORIC MORNING 
TO COVER HERE. 
ELIZABETH PALMER, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
FOR NOW SEND IT BACK TO NEW  
YORK. 
>> THANK YOU. 
FACE THE NATION MODERATOR 
MARGARET BRENNAN IS WITH US. 
WHAT DO YOU LOOK FORWARD TO 
THIS MEETING TODAY? 
>> ISOLATING VLADIMIR PUTIN IS 
NO LONGER. 
HE COMES IN THE WAKE OF THIS 
HUGE WORLD CUP, YOU KNOW, STEP 
ONTO THE GLOBAL STAGE AND NOW 
HE'S BEING WELCOMED WITH OPEN 
ARMS IN MANY WAYS BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
IT'S NOT ONLY THE KIND OF 
ATTENTION THAT HE HAS CRAVED 
BUT IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE 
MESSAGE, THAT HE'S BEEN 
DELIVERED BY WORLD LEADERS 
WHICH HAS BEEN IF YOU BEHAVE 
AND BY  MISBEHAVE, THIS 
COINCIDES WITH THE PASSENGER 
SHOOTDOWN OVER -- PASSENGER 
AIRPLANE SHOOTDOWN OVER RUSSIA. 
POISONING ON U.K. 
SOIL IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS OF 
BRITISH CITIZENS, YOU HAVE THE 
ELECTION MEDDLING, MILITARY 
INTERVENTION INTO SYRIA, INTO 
UKRAINE. 
SO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
SAYING HERE WHICH IS CONSISTENT 
WITH HIS SORT OF WORLD VIEW IS 
HISTORY STARTS NOW, IT STARTS 
WITH ME, THIS IS THE RESET HERE 
AND THAT ALL THAT DOESN'T 
MATTER AND THAT'S WHAT'S 
TROUBLING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF BECAUSE 
THEY SAY, NO, NO, WE NEED THESE 
PRECEDENTS, WE NEED TO BE ABLE 
TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON 
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO GET 
SOMEWHERE. 
>> OBAMA FAMOUSLY CALLED RUSSIA 
A REGIONAL POWER AND THAT 
SEEMED TO IRK PRESIDENT PUTIN. 
HE WANTED TO BE SEEN AS A 
GLOBAL POWER. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN LIED TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, LIED TO HIS 
FACE WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 
HE ASKED HIM ABOUT ELECTION 
MEDDLING AND ST. CLOUD PUTIN 
TOLD ME -- VLADIMIR PUTIN TOLD 
ME NO, HE DIDN'T. 
THIS LINKS THE MEDDLING WITH 
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. 
OW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SAY YOU LIED 
TO ME, WHY? 
>> FOR MANY, PARTICULARLY IN 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
ESTABLISHMENT IT IS IMPORTANT 
TO SAY WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID AND 
IN MANY WAYS THAT INDICTMENT IS 
NOT SO MUCH ABOUT PROSECUTION 
BUT IT'S ABOUT DETERRENCE. 
LOOK AT THE DETAIL IN THAT 29 
PAGES TO SAY, WE KNOW EXACTLY 
HOW YOU DID THIS SO DON'T DO IT 
AGAIN. 
AND BY DON'T DO IT AGAIN, 
ACTUALLY IF YOU LISTEN TO THE 
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE THEY ARE DOING IT 
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE'S SAYING 
THERE'S MEDDLING HAPPENING 
GOING INTO THE NOVEMBER RACES. 
>> AND HOW HARD DO WE EXPECT 
HIM TO PRESS PRESIDENT PUTIN ON 
THIS? 
HE'S BEEN RELUCTANT TO PRESS 
HIM ABOUT ANYTHING LEADING UP 
TO THIS MEETING TODAY. 
>> WELL, AND THAT'S EXACTLY IT. 
THAT'S WHY I SAY HISTORY STARTS 
WITH HIM, FOR HIM THIS IS IN 
THE PAST. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> AND THAT'S WHAT'S 
INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM THE 
HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY, 
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, FROM DAN 
COATS, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE, FROM OTHERS TIME 
AND TIME AGAIN, NO, THIS IS 
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. 
FLASHING RED LIGHTS IN TERMS OF 
MESSING WITH OUR DIGITAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY ARE TRYING 
TO EMPHASIZE THAT TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> WE SHOULD NOTE, WE ARE 
WAITING TO HEAR FROM PRESIDENT 
PUTIN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SO 
WHILE WE WAIT FOR THAT,  
MARGARET, ON THIS QUESTION, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT THE 
RUSSIANS WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE 
INTO CRIMEA IF I WERE PRESIDENT 
BUT THIRD ACCORDING TO AS -- 
BUT THEY ARE, ACCORDING TO AS 
YOU SAY, THEY ARE IN AN ONGOING 
OPERATION SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT 
THE PAST. 
IT'S ABOUT THE PRESENT AND ONE 
INTERESTING THING I THOUGHT WAS 
YOU HAVE AMBASSADOR JON 
HUNTSMAN SAY THIS IS GOING TO 
BE A -- HE'S GOING TO HOLD THEM 
TO ACCOUNT IN THIS MEETING. 
JOHN BOLTON ESSENTIALLY SAID 
THE SAME THING. 
WITH NOBODY ELSE IN THE MEETING 
WE ARE RELYING ON THE 
PRESIDENT'S WORD AFTER THE 
MEETING IS OVER TO GIVE US AN 
ACCOUNT OF HOW, WHAT HIS 
ADVISORS ARE SAYING IS THE 
NUMBER 1 AGENDA ITEM, HOW THAT 
WENT. 
>> EXACTLY. 
AND THIS PRESS CONFERENCE OF 
THEM STANDING SIDE BY SIDE, 
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE, I 
THINK, 2005 WHEN BUSH 43 HAD A 
-- WE LEARNED BETTER, WE 
LEARNED NOT TO DO THAT AGAIN 
BECAUSE WHAT IS VLADIMIR PUTIN 
GOING TO SAY STANDINGNEXT TO 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES IN TERMS  OF, NO, WE 
DIDN'T DO IT, IS DUMP GOING TO 
-- DONALD TRUMP GOING TO SAY 
YES YOU DID, IT MATTERS IF YOU 
ATTACK AMERICA EVEN IF I WASN'T 
IN THE OVAL OFFICE AT THE TIME 
-- 
>> I'M DOWNPLAYING THIS 
QUESTION OF INTERFERENCE 
BECAUSE THERE'S THINGS WE NEED 
TO WORK WITH RUSSIA ON? 
>> RIGHT. 
>> SO THAT SETS THE 
EXPECTATIONS HIGH FOR THIS 
WHICH IS TO SAY THIS 
INTERFERENCE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT, LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THAT, 
LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO 
TOGETHER. 
WHAT CAN RUSSIA AND U.S. DO 
TOGETHER, WHAT WOULD BIG 
ACHIEVEMENTS BE FROM THIS 
MEETING? 
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN'S STRATEGY 
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HE 
SAID YOU NEED ME, EVEN IF I 
MISBEHAVE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU 
HOW MUCH YOU NEED ON SOME OF 
THESE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. 
IN TERMS OF DELIVERABLE -- WE 
ARE HOPING FOR THE MOST LOW  
HANGING FRUIT IS TRYING TO 
EXTEND THE EXISTING SO-CALLED 
NEW START TREATY, WHICH, YOU 
KNOW, PUTS SOME CAPS ON 
BALLISTIC MISSILES AND THE 
LIKE. 
HOWEVER, RUSSIA IS ALREADY 
ACHIEVING ON THE INF TREATY 
WHICH IS ANOTHER NUCLEAR ARMS 
CONTROL AGREEMENT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD EXTEND 
THAT, THERE'S ALREADY A 
PROVISION IN NEW START THAT 
WOULD ALLOW HIM TO DO IT AND 
PUT THE TRUMP BRAND ON IT. 
WILL HE ACCEPT IT? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT WITH THE 
NUCLEAR -- WILL HE DO THAT 
HERE? 
THAT'S THE HOPE. 
THE OTHER THINGS ARE SOME SORT 
OF WINDOW DRESSING, SOME 
HUMANITARIAN ACCESS THEY ARE 
ASKING FOR, NFC OFFICIALS SAID 
YESTERDAY TO ME THEY WERE 
ASKING TO BE ABLE TO BRING AID 
CONVOYS INTO SYRIA, TO THE 
SOUTHERN PART OF THAT COUNTRY 
WHICH IS UNDER ASSAULT RIGHT 
NOW IN VIOLATION OF AN 
AGREEMENT THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE TWICE 
IN VIETNAM AND IN GERMANY IN 
2017. 
SO THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING, 
THIS IDEA APPROACHING, WE CAN 
HAVE ANOTHER AGREEMENT WITH 
RUSSIA IN SYRIA AT THE TIME 
WHEN THEY ARE ACTIVELY 
VIOLATING THE ONE THAT WE 
ALREADY HAVE. 
THEY ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT 
POSSIBLY WHETHER OR NOT TO 
BRING UP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN 
THE IDEA OF ASKING FOR HELP, 
EVACUATING SOME OF THOSE THE 
U.S. PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED LIKE 
THE WHITE HELMETS, THE RESCUE 
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN HELPING 
OUT SYRIANS IN DISTRESS. 
>> THE CONCERN IS THAT VAD 
PUTIN WILL -- VLADIMIR PUTIN 
WILL RUN CIRCLES AROUND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
HE'S HAD 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE AS 
PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE'S GOING 
TO APPROACH THIS BY WINGING IT, 
THE SORT OF WE WILL  SEE 
MENTALITY. 
LET'S BRINGIAN BREMER IN. 
HOW CONCERNING IS THAT? 
>> I THINK IT'S CONCERNING TO 
TRUMP'S OWN ADMINISTRATION, TO 
HIS ADVISORS, WE CERTAINLY SAW 
IN THE NATO MEETINGS THAT TRUMP 
WAS RUNNING ALL OF THESE 
BILATERALS HIMSELF. 
HE WASN'T GOING TO HIS ADVISORS 
EVEN AS HE DID AT THE G7 WITH 
LARRY  LADLO. 
IT'S THE TWO OF THEM. 
HE'S GOING TO BRING UP RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN U.S. ELECTIONS. 
WHAT'S HE GOING TO SAY? 
HOW IS TRUMP GOING TO RESPOND 
TO THAT. 
TRUMP IS THINKING, TO THE 
EXTEND THIS GUY WAS -- EXTENT 
THIS GUY WAS INVOLVED, HE WAS 
SUPPORTING ME, HE WAS GOING 
AFTER THE DNC, HE WAS GOING 
AFTER HILLARY. 
THAT'S CLEARLY ONE OF THE 
MEETINGS HE HAS TO HAVE THE 
MEETING PRIVATE, CAN'T HAVE THE 
LEGAL EXPOSURE OF HAVING 
ANYBODY IN. 
THAT'S A -- 
>> LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE SEEING -- 
>> HERE WE HAVE THE TWO 
PRESIDENTS SITTING DOWN AND WE 
WILL NOW GO TO THEM. 
 -- 
>> APPARENTLY WE HAVE THE TWO 
PRESIDENTS SITTING DOWN AND 
WE'LL NOW GO TO THEM.
 
>> AND -- DETAIL ABOUT 
ELECTORALSELECTORAL
S --
>> IS YOU, SIR. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
FIRST OF ALL, MR. PRESIDENT, 
I'D LIKE TO CON GARAGE LAT YOU 
ON -- CONGRATULATE YOU ON A 
REALLY GREAT WORLD CUP, ONE OF 
THE BEST EVER FROM WHAT 
EVERYBODY TELLS ME, ONE OF THE 
BEST EVER AND ALSO FOR YOUR 
TEAM ITSELF DOING SO WELL. 
 OF  
ALSO FOR YOUR TEAM ITSELF DOING 
SO WELL.
>> I WATCHED QUITE A BIT IN THE 
UNITED STATES, WE CALL IT  
SOCCER, AND I WATCHED QUITE A 
BIT OF IT AND I WATCHED THE 
ENTIRE FINALS AND THE 
SEMIFINALS AND THEY WERE 
SPECTACULAR GAMES BUT IT WAS 
BEAUTIFULLY DONE SO 
CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. 
GAMES, 
BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
SO CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
>> MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE A 
LOT OF GOOD THINGS TO TALK 
ABOUT AND THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. 
WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON 
EVERYTHING FROM TRADE TO 
MILITARY TO MISSILES TO NUCLEAR 
TO CHINA TO -- WE WILL BE 
TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  
CHINA, OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, 
PRESIDENT XI. 
CHINA.
OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, PRESIDENT XI.
>> I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 
OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER AS TWO 
COUNTRIES THAT, FRANKLY, WE 
HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING ALONG 
VERY WELL FOR THE LAST NUMBER 
OF YEARS. 
I'VE BEEN HERE NOT TOO LONG BUT 
IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO TWO 
YEARS, BUT I THINK WE WILL END 
UP HAVING AN EXTRAORDINARY 
RELATIONSHIP. 
I HOPE SO. 
I'VE BEEN SAYING AND I'M SURE 
YOU'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS AND 
AS YOU CAMPAIGN, THAT GETTING 
ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A GOOD 
THING, NOT A BAD THING. 
 HEARD  
TWO YEARS THAT GETTING ALONG 
WITH RUSSIA IS A GOOD THING, NOT
A BAD THING.
>> AND I REALLY THINK THE WORLD 
WANTS TO SEE US GET ALONG. 
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 
POWERS. 
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR AND 
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING. 
IT'S A BAD THING, AND I THINK 
WE HOPEFULLY CAN DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A 
POSITIVE FORCE, IT'S A NEGATIVE 
FORCE SO WE WILL BE TALKING 
ABOUT THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS. 
 
BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AMONG 
OTHER THINGS.
>> AND WITH THAT THE WORLD 
AWAITS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO 
OUR PERSONAL DISCUSSION, WHICH 
I THINK BEGINS NOW AND THEN WE 
ARE GOING TO MEET OUR WHOLE 
TEAM. 
YOU HAVE QUITE A FEW 
REPRESENTATIVES, AND WE ALL 
HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL COME UP WITH 
ANSWERS, MOST IMPORTANTLY. 
IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. 
 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL COME UP
>> THANK YOU. 
H 
ANSWERS HOPEFULLY.
IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 
U, EVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
K YOU VERY.
>> AND THERE YOU SEE THAT 
HANDSHAKE AND WARM WORDS 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP CONGRATULATING PUTIN ON A 
VERY SUCCESSFUL WORLD CUP, THAT 
HE SAYS EVERYBODY WATCHED AND 
WAS SPECTACULAR. 
ELIZABETH PALMER IS HERE WITH 
ME AND HAS COVERED PRESIDENT 
PUTIN FOR DECADES SINCE HE HAS 
BEEN IN POWER. 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HIS 
COMMENTS? 
WHAT DID HE MAKE OF HIS BODY 
LANGUAGE? 
>> HE WAS LOOKING RELAXED BUT 
NOT EAGER. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS LEANING 
FORWARD WITH IN INTENSITY. 
PUTIN ALMOST LOOKED BORED, WAY 
TOO STRONG BUT SLIGHTLY  
DETACHED. 
>> IS THAT INTENTIONAL? 
>> PROBABLY. 
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HE'S AN EX-
SPY, HE'S BEEN TRAINED IN MIND 
GAMES AND HE WAS ALSO VERY 
NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT WHAT THEY 
WOULD TALK ABOUT WHEREAS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY PUT 
SOME SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE. 
SO PUTIN IS PLAYING HIS CARDS 
VERY CLOSE TO HIS CHEST. 
>> WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS 
THE WORLD WANTS TO SEE US GET 
ALONG, GETTING ALONG WITH 
RUSSIA IS A GOOD THING, HOW 
DOES THAT SQUARE WITH WHAT THE 
REST OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION 
IS SAYING IN RUSSIA'S CURRENT 
EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY THROUGH CYBER ATTACKS 
AND OTHER MEANS? 
>> GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA 
CLEARLY IS A GOOD THING. 
THE QUESTION IS, AT WHAT COST, 
YOU KNOW AND IF IT MEANS 
PUTTING UP WITH RUSSIA'S 
CONTINUING ATTACKS ON AMERICAN 
INSTITUTIONS AND TRYING TO 
ENLARGE ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE 
IN EUROPE AND  UNDERCUTTING 
NATO, THEN PROBABLY MOST OF THE 
AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS WOULD 
SAY, NO, THE COST IS TOO HIGH 
AND IT'S  UNLIKELY THAT PUTIN 
IS GOING TO LEAVE THIS 
CONFERENCE HAVING GIVING 
ANYTHING UP, LET'S JUST SAY 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> NOW THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT 
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THAT 
SOME IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE 
TRYING TO DOWNPLAY AS JUST A 
MEETING, BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY 
HOUR AND A HALF SCHEDULED, HOUR 
AND A HALF PRIVATE MEETING THAT 
UMP CALLED A PERSONAL MEETING 
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND 
THEN A PRESS CONFERENCE, MAJOR 
GARRETT HAS BEEN COVERING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HE TRAVELS 
THROUGH EUROPE. 
WHAT ELSE STRIKES YOU ABOUT 
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MENTIONED 
JUST THIS MORNING? 
>> WELL, TALKING ABOUT THE HOPE 
FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA SETS A 
PRETTY HIGH BAR. 
ONE THING I THINK IT'S WORTH 
REMEMBERING AS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
GOES INTO THIS SUMMIT, HE'S GOT 
A COUPLE OF THINGS ON HIS MIND 
IN RELATIONSHIP TO VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
HE WILL COME IN AND SAY OUR 
ECONOMY IS VERY STRONG. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ADMINISTRATION HAS AUTHORIZED 
THE EXPORT OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL 
GAS TO EUROPE. 
IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET BUT IT'S 
IN PROCESS. 
THAT'S A COUNTER WEIGHT TO 
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE OVER ENERGY 
SUPPLIES THROUGHOUT EUROPE. 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ALSO 
APPROVED THE MOVEMENT OF LETHAL 
WEAPONS TO UKRAINE. 
THAT HASN'T CHANGED THE 
MILITARY DYNAMIC THERE IN ANY 
WAY BUT IT'S A STEP THAT THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T 
TAKE SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD 
ARGUE HERE IN HELSINKI HE DOES 
DONE THINGS TO SEND A SIGNAL TO 
PUTIN THAT HE IS GOING TO BE 
TOUGHER ECONOMY CLEE IN TERMS 
OF -- ECONOMY IN TERMS OF 
EXPORTS AND THAT'S SOMETHING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BRING INTO 
THIS MEETING AND CONVEY TO 
PUTIN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. 
>> MAJOR GARRETT, ALSO HERE IN 
HELSINKI, THANK YOU. 
AND WE WILL HAVE FULL COVERAGE 
OF THE HELSINKI SUMMIT ON CBS 
THIS MORNING AND WE WILL BRING 
YOU THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
PUTIN WHEN IT HAPPENS LATER 
THIS MORNING. 
COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON YOUR 
LOCAL NEWS ON THIS CBS STATION 
AND ON OUR 24 HOUR STREAMING 
NETWORK CBSN. 
WATCH IT AT CBSNEWS.COM. 
THIS HAS BEEN A CBS NEWS 
SPECIAL REPORT. 
I'M NORAH O'DONNELL WITH GAYLE 
KING,  JOHN DICKERSON IN  
HELSINKI. 
>> FOR NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, GO 
TO CBSNEWS.COM. 
>>> WE ARE ALSO FOLLOWING THE 
LATEST HERE AT CBSN IN HELL 
SINK WHERE PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAVE MET FACE TO 
FACE. 
LET'S GET INTO IT WITH GABE  
LIPKIN. 
GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU GUYS. 
>> THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WE 
SAW NORA ASK ELIZABETH PALMER, 
OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO HAS 
COVERED RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN FOR YEARS IS 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE BODY 
LANGUAGE? 
WHEN YOU SEE VLADIMIR PUTIN 
RELAXED AS HE IS IN THAT CHAIR, 
WHEN HE SAW HIM GET OFF THE 
PLANE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
>> YEAH, HE CAME OUT OF THE 
PLANE RIGHT AWAY VERY 
CONFIDENT, SORT OF SWAGGERING, 
TOOK HIS JACKET OFF RIGHT AWAY, 
SHAKING HANDS WITH THE FINNISH 
SOLDIERS THAT WERE THERE TO 
MEET THEM. 
HE SEEMS READY TO GO. 
THERE IS -- SUSAN GLASSER OVER 
THE WEEKEND, THIS IS LIKE  
MUHAMMAD ALI FIGHTING SORT OF A 
FEATHER WEIGHT. 
PUTIN IS PREPARED. 
HE IS A TRAINED OFFICER. 
ONE TRUMP HASN'T DONE MUCH 
PREPARATION FOR. ÃºTHE BODY LANG 
OF THIS MEETING ARE ALL VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR SORT OF 
DETERMINING HOW OVER THE NEXT 
FEW HOURS THIS GOES. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS CERTAINLY 
BEEN EXPRESSING THE GENERAL 
TOPICS THAT HE'S INTERESTED IN. 
HE DID SO RIGHT HERE, HE TALKED 
ABOUT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION, 
TALKED ABOUT TRADE, TALKED 
ABOUT CHINA BUT AT THE SAME 
TIME AS HE'S BEEN ASKED ABOUT 
THIS MEETING, HE'S INSISTED 
THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A REAL 
AGENDA, THAT IT'S -- AND HE HAS 
SORT OF GONE BACK AND FORTH 
BETWEEN CALLING IT A SUMMIT AND 
A MEETING AND IS IT CASUAL, NOT 
CASUAL, THAT SORT OF THING. 
IS THERE A BENEFIT TO NOT 
HAVING A SET AGENDA WHEN YOU'RE 
MEETING PRESIDENT PUTIN FOR THE 
FIRST TIME? 
>> I DON'T THINK SO. 
I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING 
TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS, 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE WEEKEND. 
WE SAW AMBASSADOR HUNTSMAN SAY, 
LIKE YOU MENTIONED, THIS ISN'T 
A SUMMIT, THIS IS JUST A 
MEETING. 
THIS IS THE SEVENTH -- I WOULD 
CALL IT A SUMMIT, SUMMIT 
BETWEEN U.S. AND RUSSIAN 
LEADERS, THE FIRST SINCE THE 
RUSSIAN INVASION OF CRIMEA. 
IT IS A BIG DEAL THIS IS 
HAPPENING AT ALL. 
I THINK TO GO INTO THIS WITHOUT 
ANY OBJECTIVES, WITHOUT A CLEAR 
SENSE OF WHAT A VICTORY IS OR 
WHAT'S DEALING OVER THIS  
MEETING, THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION AND OTHER ACTIONS 
IN UKRAINE TO ME IS VERY RISKY, 
VERY RISKY THING TO DO. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT DID LAY OUT AN AGENDA 
OF SORTS WHERE VLADIMIR PUTIN 
DIDN'T LAY OUT ANYTHING. 
HE WAS POKER FACED THE ENTIRE 
TIME THROUGHOUT THIS LITTLE 
INTRODUCTION THAT THEY JUST HAD 
HERE AND YET AS THE PRESIDENT 
LAID OUT SOME OF THE THINGS 
THAT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, 
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE 
ELECTION MEDDLING AND I DON'T 
KNOW IF THAT WAS PERHAPS THE 
RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE TIME TO 
DO SO BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
LAY OUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS 
THAT YOU EXPECT TO TALK TO 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN ABOUT, WHY NOT SAY, ALSO 
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
CYBER SECURITY AND CYBER 
THREATS AND, YOU KNOW -- WHAT'S 
YOUR TAKE ON WHY YOU DON'T 
BRING THAT PART OF THE 
DISCUSSION UP? 
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT 
TO GET OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT 
FROM THE GET GO? 
>> LINGERING OVER THIS WHOLE 
THING IS THE RUSSIAN MEDDLING 
IN THE U.S. ELECTION AND A LOT 
OF PEOPLE SAYING THIS SUMMIT 
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING AT ALL. 
WE SAW THE INDICTMENT OF 12 
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ON FRIDAY AND 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION KNEW 
ABOUT THAT AND DESPITE THAT 
FACT DECIDED TO GO AHEAD WITH 
IT  ANYWAY. 
SO THE FACT THAT TRUMP DIDN'T 
COME OUT FORCEFULLY AND SAY 
RIGHT AWAY, YOU KNOW, AND TALK 
ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS VERY 
TELLING AND I THINK HE GOES 
INTO THIS MEETING SORT OF IN A 
SIMILAR POSITION AS VLADIMIR 
PUTIN TRYING TO TAMP DOWN THE 
IDEA THAT RUSSIAN HAD ANY 
IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE 
ELECTION AND I THINK AS 
AMERICANS THAT'S SOMETHING WE 
SHOULD SEE AS PROBLEMATIC. 
>> WE WERE TALKING TO LUKE 
COFFEY FROM THE HERITAGE 
FOUNDATION, A CONSERVATIVE 
LEANING FOUNDATION AND HIS 
POINT WAS, SURE, YOU CAN LISTEN 
TO THE RHETORIC, LISTEN TO WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS BUT IF YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION 
HAS DONE, THE ADMINISTRATION 
HAS MAINTAINED A HARD LINE WITH 
RUSSIA. 
THE SANCTIONS ARE IN PLACE. 
THEY EXPELLED A BUNCH OF 
DIPLOMATS IN LINE WITH A NUMBER 
OF OTHER ALLIES AFTER THE 
POISONING IN BRITAIN AND TO 
YOUR POINT, THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT HAS JUST INDICTED A 
BUNCH OF RUSSIANS, MILITARY 
GUYS. 
SO MAYBE WE ARE HEARING ALL 
THIS TALK BUT REALLY IT DOESN'T 
ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING -- DOESN'T 
COUNT FOR ANYTHING, ALL IT IS 
IS ACTION. 
>> THE REST OF CONGRESS AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS A HARD LINE 
AGAINST RUSSIA MATTER ON 
SANCTIONS, CONGRESS CAN STOP 
THE U.S. FROM UNDOING THIS. 
ON SYRIA, THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION 
CAN DO AND CONGRESS CAN DO THAT 
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON. 
BUT THE VERY FACT OF THE 
PRESIDENT GOING TO MEET WITH 
THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT IN THE 
FIRST PLACE IS AMAZING. 
THE VERY FACT THAT HE DOES SO 
IN A WEEK WHERE HE ALSO BEMOANS 
NATO IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT 
SHIFTS THE BROADER LANDSCAPE, 
GEO POLITICAL LANDSCAPE  BECAUSE
-- AND BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER 
THINGS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN 
SEE AS SYMBOLS OF THE U.S. 
ISN'T GOING TO HIT BACK IN A 
WAY THAT PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS HAD. 
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. 
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES 
WHERE IT MATTERS MORE THAN 
OTHERS BUT I THINK THE IDEA 
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT HE 
-- YOU KNOW, WATCH WHAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION DOES, NOT WHAT 
TRUMP SAYS IS UNFAIR. 
>> YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT, 
WHICH IS THAT THE CONGRESS IS 
THERE TO CHECK THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND IF YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER 
THE LAST WEEK OR SO SINCE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVED IN 
EUROPE, THE PRESIDENT -- IN A 
WEEKEND INTERVIEW WITH JEFF 
GLOR SUGGESTED THAT THE EU WAS 
A BIGGER FOE THAN RUSSIA WAS 
AND YET WHAT WE SAW FROM 
CONGRESS WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS 
GOING AFTER NATO IS PAUL RYAN 
SAYING THAT NATO IS 
INDISPENSABLE, NOT TALKING 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE 
STEPPED UP THEIR COMMITMENTS. 
THEY HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO DO 
THAT BY 2024. 
THAT WAS AGREED IN 2014. 
IT SEEMS AS IF PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS DRAGGED KICKING AND 
SCREAMING TO IMPOSE THOSE 
SANCTIONS. 
HE SAYS NO ONE HAS BEEN TOUGHER 
ON RUSSIA THAN HIM. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES HAS BEEN TOUGH ON 
RUSSIA. 
IT TOOK CONGRESS TO GET THOSE 
SANCTIONS IN PLACE. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
TWO AREAS IN PARTICULAR WHERE 
THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS 
HAS BEEN TOUGH, SANCTIONS AND 
PASSED IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR 
THIS BILL CALLED CATSA WHICH 
FORCES THE PRESIDENT TO PUT 
SANCTIONS PRESIDENT ONLY ON 
RUSSIA BUT OTHER COUNTRIES AND 
FOR -- BUT ALSO ON UKRAINE ÃºWHE 
AUTHORIZED THE SENDING OF 
LETHAL WEAPONS THERE IN A MOVE 
THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 
REFUSED TO DO. 
SO THERE'S PLENTY THAT THEY ARE 
DOING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST 
CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION 
TO PUSH BACK AGAINST RUSSIA BUT 
IT'S REALLY -- IT COMES DOWN TO 
THE PRESIDENT. 
WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S WORD? 
AND VLAD, IN THE SAME WEEK HE 
CALLS THE EU A FOE AND SITS 
DOWN WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
-- 
>> AND CALLS HIM A COMPETITOR. 
>> YES AND POSSIBLY ONE THAT WE 
CAN SEE MORE OF AS A FRIEND IN 
THE FUTURE, I THINK THAT'S  
INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC. 
>> WHAT'S A WIN FOR VLADIMIR 
PUTIN? 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 
AREAS I'M SURE HE'S INTERESTED 
IN BUT HOW DOES HE WALK AWAY 
WITH A WIN CONSIDERING THERE 
ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY MAJOR 
CONCRETE DECISIONS MADE HERE? 
>> YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT 
BODY LANGUAGE. 
I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN COMES TO 
THIS MEETING NOT WANTING TO 
SHOW BOAT ABOUT WHAT HE'S 
ACCOMPLISHED. 
THERE ARE LITTLE SMIRKS BUT  HE 
-- 
>> I POINTED OUT THERE WAS. 
>> THERE WILL BE MORE OF THAT. 
HE'S IN A DELICATE POSITION 
BECAUSE HE HAS ACHIEVED A GREAT 
DEAL OF WHAT HE HAS DONE IN 
TERMS OF DIVIDING NATO, IN 
TERMS OF POSSIBLY GETTING 
RUSSIA BACK INTO THE G8, NOW 
THE G7, IN TERMS OF UKRAINE. 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SHOW BOAT 
BECAUSE CONGRESS IS VERY UPSET 
WITH RUSSIA AND HE DOESN'T WANT 
TO FLAUNT THAT IN FRONT OF 
THEM. 
JUST THIS MEETING IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR 
HIM AND I THINK THERE ARE OTHER 
ISSUES WHERE HE WILL TRY TO 
WORK OUT SUBTLY ON UKRAINE, 
SYRIA AND IRAN, OTHER THINGS 
THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH RUSSIAN 
PREROGATIVES BUT HE'S TRYING TO 
TAMP DOWN EXPECTATIONS A BIT. 
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING TOO THAT 
THE PRESIDENT IN EACH INSTANCE 
WHERE HE'S ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 
IT'S MEDDLING, WHETHER IT'S 
RUSSIA'S ANNEXATION OF  CRIMEA, 
HE PIVOTS TO BLAMING PRESIDENT 
OBAMA ABOUT THAT. 
EVEN PRIOR TO THAT PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN 
PLAYED BY RUSSIA, HE'S 
PRESIDENT CURRENTLY AND WHEN I 
READ A QUOTE LIKE THIS THAT THE 
GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER, SAID 
THIS, TO MAINTAIN OUR 
RELATIONSHIP, OUR PARTNERSHIP 
WITH THE U.S.A. 
WE MUST READJUST IT. 
THE FIRST CLEAR CONSEQUENCE CAN 
ONLY BE THAT WE NEED TO ALIGN 
OURSELVES MORE CLOSELY IN  
EUROPE. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THE GERMAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER IS SAYING,  
LOOK, WITH THE RHETORIC COMING 
OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WE CAN 
NO LONGER RELY ON THE UNITED 
STAES AS A RELIABLE PARTNER 
FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO 
THEREFORE, EUROPE NEEDS TO 
MAINTAIN ITS INTEGRITY BY EVEN 
BECOMING STRONGER THAN EVER. 
IF YOU'RE VLADIMIR PUTIN, ISN'T 
THAT ONE OF YOUR GOALS TO DRAW 
THE EUROPEANS CLOSER TO RUSSIA 
AND DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM 
THE UNITED STATES? 
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. 
EMMANUEL MACRON WAS IN RUSSIA 
FOR THE WORLD CUP FINALE BUT 
ALSO TO TALK WITH THE RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT ABOUT VARIOUS 
INTERESTS OF FRANCE AND 
NETANYAHU IS THERE AS WELL, 
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOREIGN 
LEADERS GOING TO RUSSIA TO TALK 
TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND I THINK 
THAT IS -- 
>> EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE 
SANCTIONS IN PLACE TOO, PUTIN 
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HOW TRADE HAS GOTTEN BETTER 
WITH EUROPE OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF MONTHS, EVEN WITH 
THOSE SANCTIONS. 
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND 
EUROPE SEIZE SANCTIONS AS -- 
SEES SANCTIONS AS A COMPLICATED 
THING, THEY HAVE MUCH MORE 
TRADE RELIANCE BUT MORE BROADLY 
WITH THE RUSSIANS AND PLENTY OF 
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE 
INTERESTED IN DOING BUSINESS 
WITH RUSSIA. 
THERE'S A BROADER ISSUE TOO 
ABOUT EUROPE AND THERE ARE 
PLENTY OF OTHERS WHO ARE 
LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON 
BETWEEN THE NATO SUMMIT AND 
THIS MEETING WITH PUTIN AND 
SAYING WE DO HAVE TO GO IT 
ALONE. 
MORE THE QUESTION IS, CAN THEY 
DO THAT AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE 
THEY WILLING TO USE RESOURCES 
TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THEIR 
POSITION IN THE WORLD. 
>> HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS FOR 
PUTIN, THE WAY IT PLAYS AT 
HOME? 
BECAUSE I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR 
THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME 
IMPROVEMENTS IN TRADE BECAUSE 
WE KNOW THAT THE ECONOMY IS 
FALLING APART BECAUSE OF 
SANCTIONS IN RUSSIA. 
SO THIS HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING 
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR HIM. 
I KNOW MAYBE THE NEXT ELECTION 
ISN'T IN QUESTION FOR HIM, 
PERHAPS, BUT HAVING SUPPORT OF 
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE HAS TO HAVE 
VALUE. 
>> YEAH, I THINK PUTIN HAS TWO 
BROAD PREROGATIVES. 
ONE IS TO MAINTAIN ENOUGH 
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THAT HIS 
POLL NUMBERS AND SUPPORT 
CONTINUES TO GO UP. 
HE -- THE WORLD CUP WAS A 
MASSIVE SUCCESS FOR HIM BUT 
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME HE 
HAS INSTITUTED A CONTROVERSIAL 
PENSION REFORM. 
ON THE GLOBAL SIDE PUTIN HAS 
BILLED HIMSELF AS DELIVERING 
RUSSIA BACK ONTO THE GLOBAL 
STAGE, SHOWING IT IS A POWER TO 
BE IF NOT   RECKONED WITH, AT 
LEAST HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. 
RUSSIA HAS A DEEP SENSE THEY 
SHOULD BE PART OF THE GLOBAL 
CONVERSATION, THEY ARE 
IMPORTANT POWER AND PUTIN IS 
LIVING UP TO THAT AND BY 
MEETING WITH THE U.S. 
PRESIDENT. 
>> IN YOUR ANALYSIS, GIVEN 
THAT, LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FANCIES HIMSELF 
AS A DEAL MAKER, GENERALLY WHEN 
HE COMES OUT OF THESE MEETINGS, 
WHETHER IT'S WITH KIM JONG-UN, 
NATO, EU LEADERS, HE COMES OUT 
AND SUGGESTS TO THE WORLD, 
THROUGH THE MEDIA, HERE'S WHAT 
WE  AGREED, WE HAVE GOTTEN THIS 
AND IT'S A WIN. 
HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO COME 
BACK TO THE UNITED STATES 
SAYING, LOOK WHAT I DID, I 
ACCOMPLISHED THAT. 
THIS IS SUCH A DELICATE MEETING 
WITH SUCH HIGH STAKES AT PLAY, 
I JUST WONDER, AND I'M -- I'M 
ASKING YOU TO SPECULATE HERE 
BUT JUST GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD 
AND GIVEN THE HISTORY, GIVEN 
THE FACT THAT HE CAME OUT OF 
THAT MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN 
AND SAID, LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO 
SUSPEND MILITARY OPERATIONS, 
MILITARY DRILLS WITH SOUTH  
KOREA, WHICH WAS NEWS TO THE 
SOUTH KOREANS, SOMETHING THAT 
PYONGYANG HAD WANTED FOR  
DECADES. 
HE BASICALLY GAVE THAT UP IN A 
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE 
DELIVERED RIGHT AFTER THE 
MEETING WAS BARELY OVER. 
COULD THAT BE A PROBLEM FOR THE 
UNITED STATES? 
>> THERE ARE MULTIPLE RISKS. 
YOU MENTIONED MILITARY  
EXERCISES, THERE ARE JOINT U.S. 
COULD BE GIVEN UP IN A SIMILAR 
WAY. 
I THINK OTHER ISSUES YOU COULD 
SEE ARE ON UKRAINE. 
PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED CRIMEA, 
IF HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE 
ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND SAYS 
-- 
>> YOU KNOW THAT QUESTION IS 
GOING TO COME UP. 
IF THERE'S A PRESS CONFERENCE 
THEY ARE GOING TO ASK THE 
PRESIDENT WHAT IS THE UNITED 
STATES' POSITION ON CRIMEA. 
YOU'RE NOT IN THE U.K. 
YOU'RE ON THE WORLD STAGE WITH 
THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, THE MAN 
WHO ANNEXED CRIMEA FROM 
UKRAINE. 
IF HE PIVOTS, IF HE DOES 
ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO BE 
REMARKABLE. 
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I 
THINK -- I MEAN, IN THE CONTEXT 
OF UKRAINE, THE DE FACTO 
SITUATION IS THE RUSSIANS DO 
CONTROL IT. 
BUT I THINK THE IDEA THAT A 
PRESIDENT -- U.S. PRESIDENT 
WOULD COME OUT AND SAY THAT 
IT'S -- ONE, WE ACKNOWLEDGE A 
TERRITORIAL INCURSION AND 
BASICALLY STEALING OF LAND FROM 
A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, ONE THAT 
U.S. HAS COMMITTED TO, AT LEAST 
WITH RESPECT TO TERRITORIAL 
SOVEREIGNTY WILL BE REMARKABLE 
BECAUSE MAYBE GIVE RUSSIA SORT 
OF CAUSER AT LARGE TO DO THINGS 
IN OTHER PARTS OF ITS NEAR 
ABROAD, IN GEORGIA, IN THE 
BALTICS, THAT WOULD MAKE NATO 
ALLIES AND U.S. ALLIES FEARFUL. 
>> SO THE PRESIDENT AND --  
BOTHMENTS, PUTIN AND TRUMP -- 
BOTH PRESIDENTS, PUTIN AND  
TRUMP, SPOKE EARLIER. 
PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF SOUND SO 
YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT THINKS THIS MEETING 
WILL BE ABOUT. 
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS 
TO TALK ABOUT AND THINGS TO 
TALK ABOUT. 
WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON 
EVERYTHING FROM TRADE TO 
MILITARY TO MISSILES TO NUCLEAR 
TO CHINA TO -- WE WILL BE 
TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  
CHINA, OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, 
PRESIDENT XI. 
I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 
OPPORTUNITIES AS TWO COUNTRIES 
THAT FRANKLY WE HAVE NOT BEEN 
GETTING ALONG FOR THE LAST 
NUMBER OF YEARS. 
I HAVE NOT BEEN HERE TOO LONG 
BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSER TO TWO 
YEARS BUT I THINK WE WILL END 
UP HAVING AN EXTRAORDINARY 
RELATIONSHIP. 
I HAVE BEEN SAYING AND I'M SURE 
YOU'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS AND 
AS I COMPLAINED THAT GETTING 
ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A GOOD 
THING, NOT A BAD THING. 
AND I REALLY THINK THE WORLD 
WANTS TO SEE US GET ALONG. 
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 
POWERS. 
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR AND 
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING. 
IT'S A BAD THING. 
AND I THINK WE HOPEFULLY CAN DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT A POSITIVE FORCE. 
IT'S A NEGATIVE FORCE. 
SO WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT 
THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS. 
>> SO THERE THE PRESIDENT WENT 
THROUGH A WHOLE LIST OF STUFF, 
SOME THINGS, OBVIOUSLY, NOT 
THERE, LIKE CRIMEA, LIKE SYRIA. 
HE DID FINISH OFF BY TALKING 
ABOUT NUCLEAR PROCEED LIVE 
VACATION AND THAT IT'S -- 
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND IT'S 
BAD. 
HE REITERATED THIS IDEA THAT 
IT'S A GOOD THING IF AMERICA 
GETS ALONG WITH RUSSIA, RIGHT, 
VERY SIMPLE? 
IS IT A GOOD THING AND IS IT 
POSSIBLE WITH PUTIN AS THE 
PRESIDENT? 
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY A GOOD  
THING, BUT IT'S PLAGUED, IT'S 
TROUBLED EVERY SINGLE U.S. 
PRESIDENT FOR THE LAST FEW 
DECADES. 
WE HAVE SEEN WITH OBAMA, WITH 
BUSH, WITH PRESIDENTS OF EITHER 
PARTY, USUALLY AN ATTEMPT 
WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR TO GET 
ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND THEN SOME 
CRISIS UKRAINE, GEORGIA, THE 
SHOOTING DOWN OF AIRCRAFTS OVER 
UKRAINE, BLOW IT UP. 
WE ARE AT AT CRISIS IN TERMS OF 
THE U.S. AND ELECTION AND 
RUSSIAN'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
U.S. ELECTION. 
THE VERY FACT THIS MEETING 
HAPPENING PROBABLY WOULDN'T 
HAVE HAPPENED OVER MOST U.S. 
PRESIDENTS AND I THINK THE U.S. 
AND RUSSIA SHOULD GET ALONG. 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF ISSUES, 
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION BEING THE 
MOST IMPORTANT WHERE WE CAN 
WORK TOGETHER BUT THE QUESTION 
IS ON WHAT TERMS, RIGHT? 
>> YEAH. 
>> IT IS INTERESTING, GABE, 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, I'M A 
STUDENT OF HISTORY AND AS YOU 
LOOK BACK AT THE NUMBER OF 
PRESIDENTS WHO HAD HAD TO DEAL 
WITH RUSSIAN LEADERS WHETHER IT 
WAS UNDER THE SOVIET UNION OR 
AS RUSSIA AS THE RUSSIAN  
FEDERATION, IT'S BUT FRAUGHT 
WITH DANGEROUS. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA SUGGESTED THAT 
RUSSIAN WAS A SECOND -- RUSSIA 
WAS A SECOND RATE NATION. 
IT WAS SORT OF TO SUGGEST THAT 
RUSSIA WAS NOT EVEN A FACTOR IN 
GEO POLITICS ANYMORE -- 
>> WHICH PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED 
TO THE BAD RELATIONSHIP HE HAD 
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN. 
>> OF COURSE IT DID. 
IT WAS A FUNDAMENTAL MISREADING 
OF WHAT RUSSIA -- WHAT RUSSIA'S 
NATIONAL INTERESTS ARE AS IT 
RELATES TO THE REST OF THE  
WORLD. 
AND I WONDER, WE SAY, LOOK, 
VLADIMIR PUTIN DOESN'T HAVE TO 
WORRY ABOUT POLLS, HE DOESN'T 
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT REELECTION. 
HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS. 
HE'S GOT A BROAD BRUSH TO DO 
WHAT HE WANTS. 
WHEREAS AMERICAN PRESIDENTS 
HAVE OUR -- ARE BEHOLDEN TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ELECTIONS 
SO THAT, I THINK, MAKES IT FEEL 
AS IF THE RUSSIANS HAVE A LONG 
GAME AND THAT GAME ISN'T 
PREDICATED ON THE 2020 MIDTERMS 
-- SORRY, THE 2018 MIDTERMS OR 
THE 2020 ELECTIONS. 
IT'S PREDICATED ON WHERE RUSSIA 
WILL BE STANDING ON THE WORLD 
STAGE IN YEARS AND PERHAPS EVEN 
DECADES TO COME. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS? 
>> I THINK -- WELL, FOR PUTIN, 
AGAIN, IT IS THIS IDEA OF 
DELIVERING RUSSIA BACK ONTO THE 
GLOBAL STAGE BUT IT'S BROADER 
THAN THAT.  
IT'S ABOUT  REASSERTING ITS 
INFLUENCE IN POST SOVIET 
STATES, STATES THAT WERE 
PREVIOUSLY PART OF THE SOVIET 
UNION. 
IT'S ABOUT REASSERTING ITS 
INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN 
PARTICULAR, AND THAT'S WHAT THE 
WARDEN SERIES IS ABOUT, NOT 
ONLY PROPPING UP SUPPORT FOR 
ASSAD BUT ALSO IN OTHER PARTS 
OF THE WORLD AND BEING A SORT 
OF EXPANDING RUSSIAN COMMERCE 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
WE SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
COOPERATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND 
VENEZUELA AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
IN AFRICA AND THIS IDEA THAT 
RUSSIA IS NOT AS, I THINK, 
OBAMA MISTAKENLY CHARACTERIZED 
IT A SECOND RATE POWER BUT IT 
IS A GLOBAL PLAYER BOTH IN 
ECONOMICS AND POLITICS. 
>> GABE LIPTON, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO 
BE WITH US FOR THE REST OF THE 
DAY. 
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT WE CAN CHAT 
MORE. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO BE 
CONTINUING TO COVER THIS NEWS 
OUT OF HELSINKI AS SOON AS IT 
HAPPENS. 
WE ARE EXPECTING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE AFTER THE TWO 
LEADERS MEET. 
WE ARE GOING TO BRING THAT TO 
YOU. 
FOR NOW, THOUGH, YOU ARE  
STREAMING CBSN, CBS NEWS, 
ALWAYS ON. 
>>> THAT SONG IS FROM THE 
LATEST CHART TOPPING ALBUM BY 
THE KILLERS. 
NO, THE BAND IS NOT AT ALL AS 
MENACING AS THEIR NAME 
SUGGESTS. 
CHRISTINE JOHNSON HAS THE 
PROOF. 
>> Reporter: IT'S A LITTLE HARD 
TO KNOW JUST WHAT TO MAKE OF 
BRANDON FLOWERS. 
BACK STAGE HE LOOKS LIKE HIS 
NURSE -- IT LOOKS LIKE HIS 
NERVES ARE GOING TO GET THE 
BEST OF HIM. 
BRANDON, YOU SEEMED VERY 
INTENSE RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW. 
>> IT'S NOT A NORMAL THING TO 
GO OUT AND FACE 70,000 PEOPLE 
LIKE THAT. 
I NEVER JUST FEEL TOTALLY AT 
EASE. Ãº>> Reporter: THEN HE STE 
THE SPOTLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS 
BAND, THE KILLERS. 
âªâª 
>> Reporter: AND PERFORMING 
THEIR SIGNATURE HIT, MR. BRIGHT 
SIDE, HE SOUNDS LIKE  MR. 
CONFIDENT. 
âªâª 
>> Reporter: ONE MEASURE OF THE 
SONG'S SUCCESS, IT'S BEEN 
WATCHED ON YouTube MORE THAN 
280 MILLION TIMES. 
>> I'M JUST A  GLORIFIED ELVIS 
IMPERSONATOR, THAT'S WHAT ALL 
OF US ARE. 
>> Reporter: YOU DON'T MEAN  
THAT. 
I HAVE SEEN YOU ON STAGE, YOU 
DON'T LOOK LIKE ELVIS. 
>> I'M TRYING. 
I'M DOING MY BEST. 
âªâª 
>> Reporter: IF YOU'RE NOT 
FAMILIAR WITH THE KILLERS, 
THEIR HIT LIST EXTENDS OVER 
SOME 24 MILLION ALBUMS SOLD 
WORLDWIDE AND THEY HAIL FROM 
LAS VEGAS. 
THEY ARE SO CLOSELY TIED TO THE 
REGION, YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD 
THEM IN THIS NEVADA TOURISM 
COMMERCIAL âªâª 
>> Reporter: BUT BRANDON 
FLOWERS MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN 
UNLIKELY AMBASSADOR FROM SIN 
CITY. 
HE'S PERFECTLY CONTENT PLAYING 
BACKUP AT HOME BEHIND HIS SON 
GUNNAR. 
WHO SAW WHO FIRST? 
>> WE SAW EACH OTHER BUT I 
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SHY TO TALK 
TO  HER. 
>> Reporter: HE AND HIS WIFE  
TANA HAVE THREE BOYS. 
>> AND SHE CAME UP AND GAVE ME 
HER PHONE NUMBER. 
>> Reporter: AND YOU STILL HAVE 
THIS PIECE OF PAPER? 
THIS IS WHAT THIS IS? 
>> YES. 
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS HAVE KEPT 
THIS? 
THIS IS THE ACTUAL PAPER? 
>> I SAW HE KEPT THE PHONE 
NUMBER SO I KEPT THE PAPER. 
>> Reporter: IF THEY SEEM LIKE 
AN UNUSUALLY CLEAN CUT ROCK 'N 
ROLL COUPLE IT MAY BE DUE IN 
PART TO THEIR FAITH. 
>> I SAW A VIDEO ONLINE THAT 
YOU DID FOR YOUR CHURCH. 
>> MORMON CAMPAIGN. 
WAS IT CALLED I'M A MORMON? 
I'M A MORMON. 
>> YEAH. 
>> I DON'T GO TO CHURCH BECAUSE 
I GOT NOTHING BETTER TO DO ON 
SUNDAYS. 
I REALLY BELIEVE IT. 
>> MY NAME IS BRANDON FLOWERS, 
I'M A FATHER, I'M A HUSBAND AND 
I'M A MORMON. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY LIFE WOULD 
BE LIKE WITHOUT IT. 
I THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
CASUALTY OF ROCK 'N ROLL. 
>> Reporter: SO IT SAVED YOU? 
>> FOR SURE. 
>> Reporter: AS FAITH WAS IN 
FLOWERS' BLOOD GROWING UP SO 
WAS THE GLITZ AND GRIT OF 
VEGAS. 
>> WE DEFINITELY ARE NOT SHY 
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHERE WE ARE 
FROM. 
I STILL GET A RUSH FROM IT. 
>> Reporter: THAT RUSH FROM THE 
VEGAS STRIP IS SOMETHING THAT 
FLOWERS AND KILLERS' DRUMMER 
RONNIE VA NUCCI -- VANUCCI 
EXPERIENCED EARLY ON. 
>> THE SERVICE INDUSTRY IS A 
BIG PART OF THIS TOWN AND IT'S 
HOW A LOT OF OUR FAMILY MAKE 
THEIR LIVING STILL. 
>> Reporter: AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, 
IT'S WHERE THEY FOUND THEIR 
FIRST JOBS. 
AND YOU WERE DOING WHAT HERE? 
>> I WORKED IN A RESTAURANT 
CALLED -- AND I WAS A FOOD 
RUNNER. 
I DROVE A PEDICAB. 
THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE WE 
PERFORMED. 
>> Reporter: WHERE WAS THE  
STAGE? 
>> WE HAD A CORNER. 
>> Reporter: THAT 2002 
PERFORMANCE WAS IN A SMALL 
COFFEE SHOP JUST OFF THE VEGAS 
STRIP. 
>> PROBABLY LASTED ABOUT 10 
MINUTES BUT IT FELT LIKE AN 
ETERNITY. 
IT DID. 
>> Reporter: WHEN YOU LEFT  
THERE, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING? 
>> I WAS TOTALLY OPEN TO 
LOOKING FOR ANOTHER SINGER, 
YEAH. 
I DIDN'T THINK THAT I WOULD DO 
IT AGAIN. 
WE DIDN'T GET A GOOD VIBE FOR 
VEGAS CROWDS FOR A LONG TIME. 
WE PLAYED FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY 
MAJOR LABEL IN THE U.S. AND 
NONE OF THEM WERE PICKING UP ON 
US. 
THE PRESIDENT OF WARNER BROS. 
SAID I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SEX 
APPEAL. 
>> Reporter: BUT THE KILLERS 
HAD AN ACE IN THE HOLE. 
THAT SONG MR. BRIGHT SIDE, 
GUITARIST DAVE CUNY CAME UP 
WITH A RIFF THAT HAS BECOME 
INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE. 
>> I WAS JUST JAMMING AROUND 
AND I HAD THIS COOL CHORD THAT 
I WAS PICKING AND I WAS LIKE, 
WHERE DO I GO WITH THS? 
âªâª 
>> Reporter: DID YOU KNOW -- 
>> NO. 
>> Reporter: COME ON. 
>> I WOULD GET GOOSEBUMPS 
PERFORMING IT, BUT I DIDN'T 
KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BECOME 
WHAT IT'S BECOME. 
âªâª 
>> Reporter: MR. BRIGHT SIDE 
SKYROCKETED UP THE CHARTS AND 
WITH MARK STORMER ON BASE, THE 
KILLERS BECAME HEADLINERS, BUT 
AS THEY TOURED THE WORLD, THEY 
SAY THEY NEVER FORGOT THEIR 
ROOTS. 
SO YOU GUYS WEREN'T TRASHING 
ROOMS -- 
>> NO. 
MY MOM CLEANED HOTEL ROOMS. 
I WOULDN'T TRASH A HOTEL ROOM. 
>> Reporter: AND AS THEY SOLD 
OUT STADIUMS, THEY ARE SUDDENLY 
HANGING OUT WITH THEIR IDOLS, 
PAUL McCARTNEY, ELTON JOHN, 
BONO. 
>> YOU'RE STILL STAR STRUCK 
SECRETLY, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE 
PLAYING IT COOL AND PRETENDING 
LIKE IT'S NORMAL. 
>> I REALLY IDOLIZE PEOPLE. 
SO FOR ME TO HAVE THE SAME JOB 
FOR THEM IS DIFFICULT FOR ME. 
IT TOOK ME YEARS AND YEARS TO 
PUT THOSE, YOU KNOW, BOOTS ON, 
THEN GO ON THE STAGE AND SAY 
THIS IS WHO I AM, THIS IS WHAT 
I'M DOING. 
âªâª 
>> Reporter: CLEARLY FLOWERS 
HAS OVERCOME THAT DIFFICULTY. 
IN FACT, CONSIDER WHAT HE DID 
WHEN HE WAS COMPOSING FOR THE 
KILLERS' NEW RELEASE AND FOUND 
HE HAD A CASE OF WRITER'S 
BLOCK. 
YOU WERE STUCK? 
>> I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT NAME 
DROPPING. 
I E-MAILED BONO AND MY -- CAN I 
JUST NAME DROP? 
I E-MAILED BONO, IN THE SUBJECT 
I HAVE PUT, HAVE ALL THE SONGS 
BEEN WRITTEN, QUESTION MARK AND 
THEN I PORED MY -- POURED MY 
HEART OUT HOW I WAS IN A SLUMP 
AND HIS ANSWER WAS, HAVE ALL OF 
THE SONGS BEEN WRITTEN IS A 
FANTASTIC SONG TITLE. 
>> âª HAVE ALL THE SONGS BEEN 
WRITTEN âª
>> Reporter: THE KILLERS' 
LATEST ALBUM DEBUTED AT NUMBER 
1. âªâª 
>> Reporter: AS ITS FIRST 
SINGLE SHOWS, THESE DAYS 
BRANDON FLOWERS APPEARS FULL 
WITH SELF-CONFIDENCE, IF NOT 
OUTRIGHT SWAGGER. 
ELVIS HIMSELF WOULD BE PROUD. 
âªâª 
>>> WHAT'S NEW UNDER THE SUN? 
>> GOOD MORNING. 
I'M   JANE PAULEY AND THIS IS 
SUNDAY MORNING. 
GO ON. 
>> YOU KNOW WHO I AM? 
>> WHAT DOES IT SAY ON THAT 
GRAVESTONE? 
>> HERE LIES THE OLDEST MAN 
THAT EVER LIVED. 
>> THE WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE. 
>> APPARENTLY WOMEN DON'T LIKE 
ME. 
>> EXPERIENCE, THOUGHT  
PROVOKING, INNOVATIVE AND TRULY 
ORIGINAL REPORTING. 
>> HEY, JANE. 
>> BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS 
SOMETHING NEW UNDER THE SUN. 
>> PLEASE JOIN US WHEN OUR 
TRUMPET SOUNDS AGAIN. 
>> ON CBS SUNDAY MORNING. 
>>> THE ART OF THE GLOBE IS 
SECOND NATURE FOR THE MAN OF 
THE WORLD. 
OUR  MARGARET THIGHS TICENER IS 
ABOUT TO VISIT. 
>> Reporter: TELL ME THIS ISN'T 
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE 
THE WORKSHOP OF SOME CRAZY 
VICTORIAN GENIUS WOULD LOOK  
LIKE. 
IN THE ERA OF GOOGLE MAPS, WHO 
MAKES A LIVING SMOOTHING 
WRINKLES OUT OF A CONTINENT OR 
COLORING IN THE COAST OF 
MADAGASCAR. 
MAKING GLOBES BY HAND WAS 
PRETTY CLOSE TO A LOST ART WHEN 
PETER BELLERBY DECIDED TO GIVE 
HIS FATHER ONE FOR HIS  80th 
BIRTHDAY IN 2008 AND COULDN'T 
FIND ANY WORTH BUYING. 
>> I KIND OF THOUGHT I'VE GOT A 
FEW MONTHS TO SPARE, I'LL MAKE 
A GLOBE. 
>> Reporter: YOU THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE EASY? 
>> REALLY EASY. 
>> Reporter: WRONG. 
>> TWO YEARS LATER I SOLD MY 
HOUSE, I SOLD MY CAR. 
>> Reporter: TO BANK ROLL THIS 
GLOBE? 
>> ABSOLUTELY, YES. 
>> Reporter: AND IN THE 
MEANWHILE YOUR FATHER'S 
BIRTHDAY CAME AND WENT. 
>> MORE THAN ONE OF THEM, YEP. 
>> Reporter: BY THE TIME HE HAD 
GOTTEN ONE RIGHT, HE HAD SPENT 
$250,000 ON IT AND FIGURED OUT 
HE HAD THE MAKINGS OF A  
BUSINESS. 
>> WE HAVE TO ADAPT, THIS IS A 
COLANDER. 
>> Reporter: HE HAD TO  
IMPROVISE. 
HE HAD TO CRACK THE MYSTERY OF 
HOW EXACTLY IT WAS DONE IN 
CENTURIES PAST. 
>> THERE ISN'T A MANUAL FOR 
GLOBE MAKING. 
MATHEMATICALLY I HAD MY HEAD 
AROUND HOW IT WORKS RELATIVELY 
EASILY. 
THAT WASN'T A STRUGGLE. 
ACTUALLY APPLYING A PIECE OF 
FLAT PAPER TO A SPHERE, THAT 
WAS THE STRUGGLE. 
WE START WITH THE -- ALASKA IS 
THE FIRST PIECE TO GO ON EVERY 
TIME. 
>> Reporter: WHY? 
>> WE COULD REALISTICALLY START 
IN ANY POSITION. 
IT'S NICE WATCHING THE WORLD 
DEVELOP. 
>> Reporter: TO WORK HERE -- 
>> HE WILL HERE FOR ABOUT 15 
MINUTES ON THAT PIECE. 
>> Reporter: ONE PIECE? 
>> YES. 
>> Reporter: PATIENCE IS 
REQUIRED. 
>> WE NEED TO GET WITHIN ABOUT 
.1 OF A MILLIMETER. 
>> Reporter: GOD IS SAID TO 
HAVE CREATED THE WORLD IN SIX 
DAYS BUT HERE AT BELLERBY GLOBE 
MAKERS IN NORTH LONDON, IT 
TAKES AT LEAST SIX MONTHS EVEN 
TO LEARN HOW. 
IF YOU'VE HAD TOO MUCH COFFEE 
THIS COULD BE REALLY 
DISASTROUS. 
>> YEAH. 
REALLY GOOD ATTEMPT THERE. 
>> Reporter: ATTEMPT, THAT'S 
THE KEY WORD BECAUSE I HAVE -- 
AS I HAVE JUST CUT INTO BRAZIL, 
OOPS. 
I MESSED UP URUGUAY. 
>> WE NEED TO STRETCH IT OVER 
THE GLOBE. 
TRY PUSHING THE PAPER IN BOTH 
DIRECTIONS. 
>> Reporter: OH, IT'S HARD. 
>> THROUGH THE MIDDLE. 
>> Reporter: IT MAKES WRINKLES. 
>> YEP. 
>> Reporter: HOW DO YOU GET THE 
WRINKLES OUT? 
>> YOU DON'T MAKE THEM IN THE 
FIRST PLACE. 
>> Reporter: THE COMPANY CAN 
MAKE ONLY AROUND 600 GLOBES A 
YEAR, MANY ON COMMISSION. 
THEY ARE BACK ORDERED FOR  
MONTHS. 
EVEN THE LEGS FOR STAND MODELS 
ARE CRAFTED BY HAND. 
SO A BELLERBY GLOBE IS NOT  
CHEAP. 
THE SMALLEST, SOCCER BALL SIZED 
RUNS MORE THAN $1300. 
THE BIGGEST, THE CHURCHILL, 50 
INCHES IN DIAMETER, MORE THAN 
$80,000. 
THE COST, A FUNCTION OF BOTH 
ITS SIZE AND THE LABOR REQUIRED 
TO MAKE IT. 
>> THIS ONE HAS TAKEN A YEAR 
AND TWO MONTHS. 
>> Reporter: THE CHURCHILL WAS 
INSPIRED BY GLOBES THE SAME  
SIZE, THE GENERAL GEORGE 
MARSHALL HAD PRESENTED AS 
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS TO WINSTON 
CHURCHILL AND PRESIDENT 
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT DURING 
WORLD WAR  II. 
HE SAYS HE WILL ONLY EVER MAKE 
40 CHURCHILLS. 
>> WHEN IT IS SPINNING IT WILL 
GO FOR TWO MINUTES. 
>> Reporter: ALL BY ITSELF? 
>> YES. 
>> Reporter: FOR A GLOBE MAKER, 
THE MAP CAN BE TRICKY. 
>> WE SOMETIMES MIGHT CALL A 
COUNTRY BY TWO NAMES. 
>> Reporter: TAIWAN -- 
>> TAIWAN, CHINESE  TAIPEI. 
WE MIGHT HAVE BORDERS DOWN AS 
DISPUTED BORDERS AND EVEN IN 
INDIA, IF I SELL A GLOBE IN 
INDIA. 
I CAN GO TO JAIL FOR SIX MONTHS 
IF I MARKET INCORRECTLY. 
>> Reporter: BEFORE HE MADE 
GLOBES, PETER BELLERBY WORKED 
IN TELEVISION, RAN A BOWLING 
ALLEY AND A NIGHTCLUB, RESTORED 
HOUSES AND AN ANTIQUE CAR. 
HE'S BEGUN WORKING ON THIS 1960 
BENTLEY. 
THE GLOBES AND THIS, WHAT'S THE 
COMMON DENOMINATOR? 
>> OBVIOUSLY I LOVE AMAZING 
DESIGN. 
>> Reporter: SO WHETHER IT'S 
CARS OR GLOBES -- 
>> AMAZING. 
>> Reporter: -- PETER BELLERBY 
HAS MADE THE ART OF THE ELEGANT 
AN ATTIC ANACRONISM. 
>>> I'M JANE PAULEY AND THIS IS 
SUNDAY MORNING. 
>> EXPERIENCE THOUGHT 
PROVOKING, INNOVATIVE AND TRULY 
ORIGINAL REPORTING. 
>> HEY, JANE. 
>> BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS 
SOMETHING NEW UNDER THE SUN. 
>> PLEASE JOIN US WHEN OUR 
TRUMPET SOUNDS AGAIN. 
>> ON CBS SUNDAY MORNING. 
>>> THIS IS YOUR EYE OPENER, 
THIS IS YOUR MORNING, CBS THIS 
MORNING. 
>>> YOU ARE LOOKING AT LIVE 
PICTURES FROM HELSINKI, FINLAND 
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PUTIN 
ARE HOLDING AN HISTORIC SUMMIT. 
THE TWO MEN ARRIVED AT THE 
FINISH PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 
BEFORE BEGINNING THEIR CLOSED 
MEETING. 
THEY MADE BRIEF REMARKS TO 
REPORTERS INSIDE THE PALACE. 
>> THIS IS THREE DAYS AFTER THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FORMALLY 
ACCUSED 12 RUSSIANS OF HACKING. 
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES HAVE 
CONDEMNED HOLDING THESE 
MEETINGS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE COULD 
HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
WITH HIS RUSSIAN COUNTERPART 
AND WANTS TO GET ALONG. 
BEFORE MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAT DOWN 
FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH JEFF GLOR 
. WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY 
INTERVIEW. 
>> JUST BACK IN GOOD TO BE 
HERE. 
HOW MUCH THIS MEETING MEANS 
DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK TO. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS AN OPEN 
CONVERSATION. 
THOSE WHO KNOW VLADIMIR PUTIN 
SAY HE WILL WANT CONCRETE STEPS 
TAKEN. 
HE IS NOT NEW TO THIS. 
THIS IS THE THIRD U.S. 
PRESIDENT HE HAS DEALT WITH. 
>> Reporter: PRESIDENT BUSH 
SAID THAT HE SAW INTO HIS SOUL, 
I THINK HE REGRETTED THAT. 
HE SAID VLADIMIR PUTIN TOYED 
WITH OBAMA. 
>> I'VE MET HIM TWO TIMES, MOST 
OF YOU PEOPLE WERE THERE WHEN I 
MET HIM. 
I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE A VERY 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP, AND I THINK 
I MAY HAVE A VERY BAD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. 
I'VE NO IDEA. 
I LOVE THAT THE UNITED STATES. 
HE OBVIOUSLY LOVES RUSSIA. 
HE IS FOR RUSSIA; I AM FOR THE 
U.S. WE WILL SEE WHAT COMES OF 
IT. 
WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR A VERY 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
THE COUPLE OF TIMES I MET HIM, 
WE GOT ALONG VERY WELL. 
IF I GOT ALONG WITH THEM, THAT 
IS A GOOD THING. 
WE ARE A MAGNIFICENT POWERFUL 
COUNTRY. 
THEY ARE A VERY POWERFUL 
COUNTRY. 
WE ARE BOTH NUCLEAR COUNTRIES. 
GETTING ALONG IS A GOOD THING, 
NOT A BAD THING. 
BUT MAKE THE RUSSIANS INDICTED, 
WOULD YOU ASK VLADIMIR PUTIN TO 
SEND THEM HERE? 
>> I MIGHT. 
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. 
THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THEY WERE DOING WHATEVER IT WAS 
DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING 
OR PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HACK 
INTO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL 
COMMITTEE AS WELL, BUT WE HAD 
MUCH BETTER DEFENSES. 
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 
HACKED. 
>> THE GOAL OF THE MEETING, HE 
SAID HE WOULD TELL US AFTER. 
WE ASKED ABOUT THE TONE HE 
WOULD LIKE TO STRIKE. 
HE BROUGHT UP INVESTIGATIONS 
AND SAYING THEY HAMPER 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND 
RUSSIA. 
I ALSO ASKED THE PRESIDENT AT 
ONE POINT WHO HE THOUGHT 
AMERICA'S BIGGEST GLOBAL FOE  
IS AT THIS POINT. 
>> I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF 
OPPONENTS, THE EUROPEAN UNION 
IS A FOE.  
WHAT THEY DO TO US WITH TRADE. 
RUSSIA IS A FOE IN  CERTAIN 
RESPECTS, CHINA AS WELL, THAT 
DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE BAD. 
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, IT 
MEANS THEY ARE COMPETITORS. 
THEY WANT TO DO WELL, AND WE 
WANT TO DO WELL. 
>> I FOLLOWED UP AND SAID SOME 
PEOPLE MAY BE SURPRISED TO HEAR 
YOU LISTED THE EU AS THE FIRST 
FOE . HE DOUBLED DOWN. 
HE SAID THIS IS THE FOCUS RIGHT 
NOW FOR HIM AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS ON THIS 
TRADE, ON REDOING THESE DEALS 
AND THE NATO PAYMENTS. 
HE STOOD BY THAT. 
>> BUT THEN YOU RESPONDED, BUT 
IF ANYONE SAYS THAT WE ARE IF OH
-- THAT WE ARE A FOE, YOU SAY 
IT IS FAKE NEWS.  
>> IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE EU
INJECTED ITSELF INTO THE DEBATE 
AS WELL. 
CLEARLY, IT IS A TOPIC THAT IS 
RUBBING SOME FOLKS THE WRONG 
WAY ON BOTH SIDES. 
BUT IT IS ONE THAT I DON'T 
THINK, AS WE'VE SEEN CLEARLY, 
THE PRESIDENT WILL LET GO OF 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> YOU CAN SEE MORE OF HIS 
CONVERSATIONS TONIGHT ON THE 
CBS EVENING NEWS AND ON 
WEDNESDAY. THE PRESIDENT WILL 
SIT DOWN WITH JEFF FOR A SECOND 
POST SUMMIT INTERVIEW IN 
WASHINGTON. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MEETING 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS RIGHT NOW. 
LET'S GO BACK TO NORA. 
>> Reporter: GOOD ONE. 
THE PRIVATE MEETING BETWEEN 
THEM IS EXPECTED TO LAST AN 
HOUR AND A HALF. 
RESIDENT TRUMP WHO BRAGS ABOUT 
HIS ABILITY TO MAKE A DEAL IS 
SITTING ON WITH ONE OF THE MOST 
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS ON THE 
WORLD STAGE. 
DURING HIS TIME IN POWER, HE IS 
MET WITH EVERY U.S. PRESIDENT 
SINCE BILL CLINTON. 
GEORGE BUSH SAID HE LOOKED INTO 
HIS EYES TO GET A SENSE OF HIS 
SOUL. 
NONE OF THESE LEADERS IN THE 
PAST SAID THEY WANTED TO HAVE A 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. 
>> HE IS A CIPHER. HE CAME 
SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE. 
EVERYONE SINCE THEN HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO READ THE TEA LEAVES 
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF GUY 
HE IS. 
BUT HE IS VERY PRIVATE. 
BEFORE THERE IS KREMLIN APOLOGY 
-- THE STUDY OF KREMLIN, BUT 
NOW HE IS HIS OWN CIPHER. 
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN IS OFTEN 
CALLED A MODERN-DAY CZAR HE 
WALKS LIKE A MAN IN CHARGE. 
HE WAS TRAINED AS A KGB AGENT, 
AND IT IS IN HIS DNA TO VIEW 
THE UNITED STATES AS AN 
ADVERSARY. 
HE IS AN OLD FASHION HE-MAN, 
THE OPPOSITE OF POLITICALLY 
CORECT. 
HIS NEGOTIATING TACTICS INCLUDE 
MIND GAMES. 
HE ONCE TOOK HIS DOG TO A 
MEETING WITH ANGELA MERKEL WHO 
IS AFRAID OF THEM AND HE KEPT 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAITING FOR 40 
MINUTES. 
HE IS ALSO A POPULIST WHO CAN 
TURN ON THE CHARM ESPECIALLY 
DURING HIS EPIC ASK THE 
PRESIDENT CALL IN SHOWS. 
HE LOVES WEALTH AND THE 
TRAPPINGS OF POWER AT AN -- AT 
ALMOST ANY COST. 
HE STOOD AT THE OLYMPIC'S WHILE 
RUSSIAN ATHLETES WERE DOPING ON 
A MASSIVE SCALE. 
HE RESPECTS STRENGTH BOTH 
POLITICAL AND MILITARY. 
HE HAS A BLACK BELT IN JUDO. 
OPPONENTS SAY HE IS NIMBLE AND 
RUTHLESS. 
A FORMER CIA OFFICER STATIONED 
IN MOSCOW: 
>> HE WILL LOOK FOR SUBTLE 
SIGNALS AND VULNERABILITIES 
THAT HE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
IN THE MEETING. 
A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING IS THE 
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO DO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
>> Reporter: HE ONCE SAID THAT 
THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET 
UNION WAS THE GREATEST 
CATASTROPHE OF THE 20th 
CENTURY. 
EVERYTHING HE SAYS AND DOES IS 
ABOUT REVERSING THE COLLAPSE, 
IN SHORT, MAKING RUSSIA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO IDENTIFY WITH. 
>> AS THEY HAVE THAT MEETING 
RIGHT NOW. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A CLOSER 
LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THESE TWO PRESIDENTS. 
>> AT THE START OF THE SUMMIT, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE PLAN 
REPORTED THAT THE WORLD WANTS 
TO SEE US GET ALONG. 
WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE EVENTS THAT PRECEDED THE 
SUMMIT. 
AND IF YOU ARE ON THE GO, 
HERE'S AN INVITE TO SUBSCRIBE

TODAY'S TOP STORIES AND MORE. 
 
>>> WE HAVE CONTINUING COVERAGE 
FROM HELSINKI WHERE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN ARE 
HOLDING A SUMMIT. 
WE THE SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS 
CONTRIBUTOR WITH INFORMATION 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LEAD 
UP. 
THE LEAD UP A BEING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS WITH THE NATO 
LEADERS. 
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT 
MEETING? 
>> THE EMERGENCY SESSION WHERE 
THEY ASKED THE GEORGIAN AND 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTS TO LEAVE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR 
PRESENTATION. 
APPARENTLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
SAYING OKAY, WE'RE DONE WITH 
YOU NOW. 
THE BIG THING WAS HE WASN'T 
GETTING COMMITMENTS FROM OTHER 
LEADERS TO SPEND MORE. 
MANY OF THEM SAID WE HAVE TO 
ASK OUR PARLIAMENTS. 
WE CAN JUST TELL YOU WE WILL 
SPEND MORE. 
TRMP TURNS AROUND TO THE 
TURKISH PRESIDENT AND SAYS, 
EXCEPT FOR HIM OVER HERE, HE 
DOES THINGS THE RIGHT WAY AND 
HE FIST BUMPS THE TURKISH 
PRESIDENT. 
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT 
EXTENT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE 
WITH HIM, THIS IS VERY VISIBLE. 
IT'S A VERY VISIBLE SUGGESTION. 
>> WHY WOULD THE AMERICAN DOSE 
WHY WOULD THEY BE NERVOUS TO 
HAVE THE MARKET PRESIDENT 
TALKING TO THE TURKEY PRESIDENT?
TURKEY IS HARDLY A LIBERAL 
DEMOCRACY. 
ANOTHER THING THAT WAS 
INTERESTING IS THAT APPARENTLY 
THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER WAS 
THE LAST PERSON TO INTERVENE AT 
THE SUMMIT BEFORE TRUMP HAD HIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE. 
HE BASICALLY SAID LOOK, YOU ARE 
REALLY FRUSTRATED, WHY DON'T 
YOU JUST TAKE A VICTORY LAP. 
SAY THAT THE ALLIES HAVE BEEN 
SPENDING $33 BILLION MORE SINCE 
YOU BECAME PRESIDENT, TAKE A 
CREDIT FOR IT. 
THAT WAS THE LAST THING TRUMP 
HEARD BEFORE HE LEFT THE 
MEETING, AND IT WAS THE FIRST 
THING HE SAID. 
>> IT WOULD MAKE A FIST BUMP 
REALLY DISTURBING FOR PEOPLE TO 
SEE. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE COMMENTS
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
PUTIN MADE? 
>> INTERESTING THAT TRUMP 
SPECIFICALLY TALKED ABOUT CHINA 
A FAIR BIT MORE THAN ANYTHING 
ELSE. 
>> HE DID NOT MENTION RUSSIAN 
MEDDLING. 
>> HE SAID HE WOULD BRING IT 
UP. 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT DO 
BELIEVE THAT LONG TERM, THE 
UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA SHOULD 
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
CHINA IS THE PROBLEM. 
CHINA IS THE EMERGING 
SUPERPOWER. 
CHINA IS ACTUALLY THE TRUE 
COMPETITOR UNDERMINING 
AMERICANS AND UNDERMINING THE 
RUSSIANS LONG-TERM. 
I THINK THAT WAS STEVE 
O'BANNON'S VIEW WHEN HE WAS THE 
CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT 
TRUMP IS CLEARLY TURNING 
AGAINST BEIJING WITH $200 
BILLION ANNOUNCED IN TARIFFS, 
THE ON HELPFULNESS IN THE NORTH 
KOREAN PERSPECTIVE, I THINK THAT
SET THE. 
THE OTHER THING IS 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
>> WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT RIGHT 
THERE.

GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING.

VLADIMIR PUTIN IS UNDERWAY. 
HE SPOKE TO REPORTERS BEFORE 
STARTING. 
HE CLAIMED THAT BEFORE THE 
HISTORIC MEETING, THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA HAS 
NEVER BEEN WORSE. 
HE SAID HE WANTS TO CHANGE THAT.
>> I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 
OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER AS TO 
COUNTRIES WHO HAVE FRANKLY NOT 
GOT ALONG VERY WELL FOR THE 
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. 
I'VE BEEN HERE NOT LONG, BUT 
IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO 2 YEARS. 
I THINK WE WILL END UP HAVING 
AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP. 
I'M SURE YOU HAVE HEARD. 
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
CALLED THE MEETING A SUCCESS IN 
ITS OWN RIGHT. 
GOOD MORNING. 
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. 
JUST A LITTLE DRAMA TO START 
OUT THE SUMMIT. 
IT GOT OFF TO A LATE START 
BECAUSE PRESIDENT PUTIN ARRIVED 
ABOUT ONE HOUR BEHIND SCHEDULE 
AND KEPT TRUMP WAITING. 
THEY ARE WAITING BEHIND CLOSED 
DOORS WITH JUST TRANSLATORS. 
IT IS UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE A 
U.S. PRESIDENT AND A U.S. 
PRESIDENT MEET ALONE FOR THAT 
PERIOD OF TIME. 
WHILE THE EXPECTATIONS FROM THE 
PRESIDENT ARE IN HIGH, THEY 
SAID THEY SHOULDN'T EXPECT MAJOR
BREAKTHROUGHS. 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE AISLE SAY THEY 
HOPE THE PRESIDENT WILL BRING 
UP RUSSIA MEDDLING IN THE 2016 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
YOU CAN HEAR OTHER CURRENT 
DIPLOMATS AND INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICIALS SAYING THAT ONLY WHAT 
RUSSIA HAS DONE IN THE PAST, 
BUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT 
THIS DAY IN TERMS OF ATTACKING 
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. 
THIS COMES JUST DAYS AFTER THE 
INDICTMENT OF 12 RUSSIAN AGENTS.
THEY ARE FACING A NUMBER OF 
ELECTION RELATED CHARGES 
INCLUDING CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT 
COMPUTER CRIMES AND IDENTITY 
THEFT. 
IT SHOULD NOT GO UNNOTICED WITH 
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE SAYING JUST BEFORE 
THE SUMMIT STARTED, THE THREAT 
OF A CYBER ATTACK IS STILL 
WIDESPREAD. 
SOME U.S. OFFICIALS WHO ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT POTENTIAL 
CONCESSIONS, THE PRESIDENT MAY 
MAKE THEM IN THE PRIVATE 
MEETING. 
>> GOOD MORNING. 
AS YOU SAID, IT IS 
UNPRECEDENTED FOR AN AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT TO HAVE THIS MUCH 
TIME ALONE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
IT IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPROACH TO 
DIPLOMACY. 
REMEMBER EARLY ON, HE MET ONE-
ON-ONE WITH THE CHINESE 
PRESIDENT. 
HE PREFERS ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS 
BECAUSE HE HAS THIS BOTTOMLESS 
SELF-CONFIDENCE ABOUT TAKING A 
WORLD LEADER IN THE SPACE WHERE 
THERE'S JUST TWO OF THEM AND 
NEGOTIATING ON THEIR BEHALF. 
WITHOUT ANY OTHER INTERFERENCE. 
IT GRATES AN OPPORTUNITY BUT IT 
CREATES RISKS. 
IN BRUSSELS, I ENCOUNTERED MANY 
NATO MINISTERS WHO WERE 
SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS ABOUT THE 
PROSPECT OF RUSSIAN RESIDENT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN TALKING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP INTO MAYBE AN 
OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL SEMI 
RECOGNITION OF RUSSIA'S 
ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA. MAYBE 
CANCELING JOINT NATO EXERCISES 
AND DOING THINGS FROM A NATO 
PERSPECTIVE WOULD WEAKEN THE 
ALLIANCE AND STRENGTHEN RUSSIA. 
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MAY COME 
OUT OF THE PRIVATE MEETING OR 
IF WE WILL GET A CLEAR READ 
FROM EITHER OF THOSE PRESIDENTS 
ABOUT JUST EXACTLY WHAT THEY 
DISCUSSED. 
THERE WILL BE A WORKING LUNCH. 
THEN A PRESS CONFERENCE FROM 
BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESENT
WHERE WHITE HOUSE ADVISORS 
ASSURED ME AGAIN JUST THIS 
MORNING THAT THEY WILL TAKE 
QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS. 
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN MORE 
THAN A DECADE. 
IT WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE 
THOSE TWO LEADERS ON THE STAGE 
TAKING QUESTIONS. 
FOR MORE ON WHAT TO EXPECT, 
LET'S GO BACK TO JOHN IN NEWARK 
-- NEW YORK. 
>> MARGARET BRENNAN IS HERE, 
WILLIAM BURNS IS WITH US AS 
WELL. 
HE SERVED AS AMBASSADOR TO 
RUSSIA FROM 2005 THROUGH 2008 
AND MET PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
YOU SAID THAT THE BEST THING 
THAT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIS 
MEETING IS THAT IT WOULD BE 
HIPPOCRATIC WHICH IS TO SAY THE 
HIPPOCRATIC OATH, DO NO HARM. 
>> FIRST MEANS IT IS ESSENTIAL 
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAKE CLEAR 
TO PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT THE 
ELECTION MEDDLING WHICH WAS 
DOCUMENTED LAST WEEK IS A MAJOR 
ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY. 
IT IS VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS. 
I THINK IT MEANS NOT SUCCUMBING 
TO THE ILLUSION THAT PERSONAL 
RAPPORT CAN TRANSFORM 
RELATIONSHIPS OR THAT THEY ARE 
HAVING GRAND BARGAINS TO BE 
MADE. 
AND I THINK YOU CAN FOCUS ON A 
FEW PRACTICAL STEPS ESPECIALLY 
IN ARMS-CONTROL WITH THE NEW 
START PROCEDURE EXPIRES IN A 
COUPLE YEARS. 
THAT IS A CONVERSATION WE 
SHOULD RESUME WITH THE RUSSIANS.
>> THE PERSONAL RAPPORT POINT 
COME IS THAT SOMETHING EVERY 
PRESIDENT NEEDS TO LEARN? 
GEORGE W. BUSH, THEY SAID WE 
ARE GOING TO FALL FOR A COZY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIAN 
LEADER, THERE ARE INTEREST 
SEPARATE AND APART. 
>> PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
MATTER, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE 
TETHERED TO HISTORY FOR A SENSE 
OF WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO 
ACCOMPLISH. 
THIS IS ABOUT JUST GETTING 
ALONG WITH ANOTHER LEADER, IT'S 
ABOUT PURSUING AMERICAN IS JUST 
-- AMERICAN INTERESTS. 
>> IS IT A FAIR CRITICISM? 
>> IN THE TWEET THE PRESENCE OF 
THIS MORNING, HE SAID NOT ONLY 
OUR RELATIONS AT THE LOW-END, 
BUT IT IS BASICALLY HIS 
PREDECESSOR'S FAULT. THAT ISN'T 
NECESSARILY TETHERED TO HISTORY.
THE INTERVENTION IN SYRIA AND 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS 
IN 2016. 
>> IN OPENING COMMENTS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WILL 
ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS, AREN'T 
WE PAST THE POINT OF ASKING 
QUESTIONS? 
THAT HAPPENED AT THE LAST 
MEETING. 
DON'T WE NEED ANSWERS RIGHT 
NOW? 
>> AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, WHAT 
DO YOU EXPECT? 
A PERRY MASON MOMENT? 
HE SEEMS TO BE DISMISSING THIS 
IDEA THAT A CONFRONTATION IS 
NEEDED EVEN THOUGH HE PRIDES 
HIMSELF ON TOUGH TALK. 
THE QUESTION, I THINK IS, HE 
WANTS TO TURN THE PAGE AND PUT 
THE TRUMP BRAND ON IN TERMS OF 
A NEW DEAL WHETHER IT'S ARMS-
CONTROL OR SOME TYPE OF 
BREAKTHROUGH IN SYRIA OR THE 
UKRAINE. 
THE CONCERN LEADING UP TO THIS 
IS, LET'S JUST HAVE OUR FINGERS 
CROSSED THAT NATO IS GOOD 
ENOUGH AND HE DOESN'T GIVE 
PUTIN ANYTHING. 
THEY ARE CONCERNED HE COULD 
CALL OF MILITARY EXERCISES IN 
THE BALTIC, LIKE WHAT HE DID 
WHEN HE MET WITH THE NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER, CALL SOMETHING 
OFF WITHOUT GETTING ANYTHING IN 
RETURN. 
COULD HE DO SOMETHING LIKE IT 
RECOGNIZE THE ANNEXATION OF 
CRIMEA WHICH DESPITE THE DENIALS
ON THE RECORD, THEY WILL SAY 
OFF THE RECORD, YES, HE HAS 
OPENED THE DOOR TO THAT. 
WHY DOES THAT MATTER? 
BECAUSE YOU ARE THEN LESSENING 
THE SEIZURE OF TERRITORY BY 
FORCE. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT 
INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BEEN 
ESTABLISHED TO TRY TO PREVENT 
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. 
AS MAJOR GARRETT POINTED OUT, 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON 
PAPER HAS A TOP HARD-LINE 
POSITION AGAINST RUSSIA WHETHER 
IT IS LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS OR 
ARMS TO UKRAINE. 
IT HASN'T BEEN BACKED UP BY 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS. 
>> WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE 
DIFFERENCE IN STYLES? 
>> I THINK THE FORMAT OF THE 
SUMMIT WHERE A ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING IS A CENTERPIECE OF IT 
IN A VERY LOOSELY PREPARED 
SUMMIT IS A BIG CONTRAST TO 
SUMMITS THAT I'VE KNOWN AND 
LAST 30 YEARS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETINGS, BUT THEY ARE A SMALL 
PART OF A CAREFULLY PLANNED 
SUMMIT. 
SECOND, YOU HAVE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WHO PRIDES HIMSELF ON 
WINGING THINGS. 
>> OPERATING FROM HIS GUT. 
>> I DON'T THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN 
EVER WINGS THINGS. 
YESES WELL PRACTICED NARRATIVE 
OVER WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE 
LAST 20 YEARS SINCE HE WAS 
PRESIDENT. 
HE IS DEEPLY EXPERIENCED. 
HE WILL TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF THAT. 
>> YOU THINK HE HAS AN 
ADVANTAGE? 
>> I THINK HE DOES AND THAT HE 
IS A VASTLY EXPERIENCED LEADER. 
HE IS IN AT ALL SENTIMENTAL 
ABOUT PERSONAL RAPPORT. 
HE CAN CONTROL AS WELL AS BULLY.
>> AND YOU HAVE THE PROTECTION 
TYPICALLY FROM THE AMBASSADOR. 
>> THEY ARE EXPECTED TO SPEAK 
TO REPORTERS AROUND 9:50 A.M.. 
>>> A COUNTRY LEADER IS 
RESPONDING TO THE WORLD CUP. 
>>  
>> HE IS A SUPERSTAR. 
HE BECAME THE SECOND TEENAGER 
TO SCORE AND A FINAL. 
THE SIX GOALS MADE AT THE 
HIGHEST SCORING FINAL SINCE 
1966. 
THE GENEROUS REACTION OF THE 
CROATIAN PRESIDENT IS DRAWING 
PRAISE AROUND THE WORLD. 
SHE CAN BE SEEN WEARING THE 
JERSEY WHILE CHEERING ALONGSIDE 
THE FRENCH PRESIDENT. 
DURING THE RAINSOAKED TROPHY 
PRESENTATION WITHOUT AN 
UMBRELLA, SHE HUGGED AND 
COMFORTED MEMBERS OF CROATIA'S 
TEAM AND SHOWERED LOVE ON THE 
VICTORIOUS FRENCH PLAYERS. 
PELCTWEETED AND SAID IF HE 
KEEPS SCORING LIKE THAT, I WILL 
HAVE TO GET MY CLEATS. 
 
>> IT WAS NICE SEEING HER 
WITHOUT THE UMBRELLA HUGGING 
THE PLAYERS. 
WHAT A NICE GESTURE, THE IMAGE 
OF THAT. 
>>> THE THAI SOCCER PLAYERS ARE 
THANKING THE RESCUERS WHO SAVE 
THEIR LIVES. 
THE EMOTIONAL MEETING WITH A 
MEDICAL CARE FOR THEM DURING 
MUCH OF THEIR ORDEAL. 
YOU ARE WATCHING CBS THIS 
MORNING. 
>>> THE 12 BOYS AND SOCCER 
COACH WHO SPENT MORE THAN TWO 
WEEKS OF TRAPPED IN A CAVE ARE 
EXPECTED TO GO HOME THIS WEEK. 
NEWLY RELEASED PHOTOS TO SHOW 
THE BOYS IN THE HOSPITAL THIS 
MORNING. 
THEY CAN BE SEEN HUGGING THE 
NAVY MEDIC WHO TOOK CARE OF 
THEM IN THE CAVE. 
>> Reporter: HEALTH OFFICIALS 
SAY THE BOYS ARE DOING WELL. 
SOME LOST AS MUCH AS 11 POUNDS 
AND ARE STARTING TO GAIN WEIGHT 
BACK. 
MEANWHILE, THE PARENTS WERE 
BACK IN A CAVE FOR A CEREMONY. 
VOLUNTEERS ALONG WITH THE 
FAMILIES GATHERED AT THE CAVE 
IN THAILAND MONDAY WITH A 12 
BOYS AND THEIR SOCCER COACH 
WERE RESCUED AFTER BEING 
TRAPPED FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.
THE CAVE HAS BEEN CLOSED EVER 
SINCE THE LAST BOY WAS PULLED 
OUT. 
THERE ARE PLANS TO MAKE IT INTO 
AN INTERACTIVE MUSEUM. 
FOR NOW, EVERYONE IS JUST 
GRATEFUL. 
DANCERS TOOK PART IN EIGHT TIE 
RITUAL WHILE MONKS HELD A 
BUDDHIST CLEANSING CEREMONY. 
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE WHERE THE 
FAMILIES OF THE BOYS AND 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE COME 
TO PAY RESPECT. 
>> A MEMORIAL CEREMONY WAS HELD 
FOR THE FORMER NAVY SEAL WHO 
DIED DURING THE RESCUE MISSION. 
NEW PHOTOS SHOW THE 12 BOYS 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE SEAL FROM 
THEIR HOSPITAL ROOM. 
THEY BOWED THEIR HEADS AS THEY 
SURROUNDED A DRAWING OF THE 
DIVER. 
SOME LATER WIPED AWAY TEARS. 
>> Reporter: EARLIER, THE VIDEO 
WAS RELEASED OF THE BOYS SAYING 
THEY FEEL WELL AND THANKED 
RESCUERS. 
THE THAI BOYS HOPE THAT THE 
ENTIRE GROUP WILL GO HOME BY 
THURSDAY. 
THE PARENTS ACTUALLY WENT INTO 
THE CAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THIS AFTERNOON SINCE THE BOYS 
HAVE BEEN RESCUED. 
ONE FATHER TOLD US IT WAS 
SPOOKY FOR HIM, BECAUSE HE HAD 
BEEN PREPARING HIMSELF FOR THE 
IDEA THAT HIS SON MAY NOT 
EMERGE FROM THE CAVE ALIVE. 
>> WOULD YOU GUYS WANT TO GO IN 
THE CAVE? 
>> I THINK I WOULD. 
I WOULD WANT TO SEE. 
>> TO UNDERSTAND THE 
EXPERIENCE. 
>>> AMAZON PRIME DAY IS HERE. 
IT IS HERE AND LONGER THAN EVER 
BEFORE. 
AMAZON COMPETITORS ARE TRYING 
TO LURE SHOPPERS WITH THEIR OWN 
DEALS. 
YOU ARE WATCHING CBS THIS 
MORNING. 
WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
 
 
>>> WELCOME BACK. 
IT IS TIME TO SHOW YOU SOME OF 
THIS MORNING'S HEADLINES. 
USA TODAY REPORTS MICROSOFT'S 
PRESIDENT'S WARNING ABOUT 
FACIAL RECOGNITION. 
BRAD SMITH SAYS THERE HAS BEEN 
HUGE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND 
IT WILL SOON BE POSSIBLE FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT TO TRACK YOU 
EVERYWHERE YOU GO WITHOUT YOUR 
PERMISSION OR KNOWLEDGE. 
HE WANTS CONGRESS TO REGULATE 
THE TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT 
PRIVACY AND FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION. 
MICROSOFT IS THE FIRST BIG TECH 
COMPANY TO RAISE SERIOUS 
ALARMS. 
THEY SUPPLY BUSINESSES WITH 
FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY 
BUT THEY HAVE REQUESTED DOSE 
THEY HAVE REJECTED SOME 
REQUESTS THAT INVOLVE HUMAN 
RIGHTS RISKS. 
>>> AN ESCAPED JAGUAR KILLED 
FIVE ALPACAS, TWO FOXES, AND 
ONE EMAIL. 
NO HUMANS WERE HURT. 
THE JAGUAR ESCAPED FROM HIS 
ENCLOSURE ON SATURDAY MORNING. 
HE WAS CAPTURED LESS THAN AN 
HOUR LATER. 
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
ENCLOSURE IS UNDERWAY. 
>> AND THE SEATTLE TIMES 
REPORTS TODAY IS PRIME DAY, A 
DAY OF DEALS AT AMAZON AND ITS 
RIVALS. 
THE ONLINE RETAIL GIANT WILL 
GIVE AMAZON PRIME MEMBERS 
ACCESS TO MORE THAN 1 MILLION 
DEALS OVER 36 HOURS. 
THAT INCLUDES DISCOUNTS ON 
ALEXA PRODUCT LIKE THE ECHO AND 
FIRE TABLET. 
THERE WILL BE PRIME DEALS AT 
WHOLE FOODS AS WELL. 
THE SALE IS STIRRING UP 
COMPETITION AND CHANGING THE 
SUMMER RETAIL LANDSCAPE. 
OTHERS LIKE TARGET AND MACY'S 
OFFER DEALS OF THEIR OWN. 
THIS IS THE FOURTH AMAZON PRIME 
DAY NOW. 
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT. 
>> A LOT OF THE DEALS ARE 
WAITING UNTIL 3:00. THEY WANT 
YOU TO HAVE THE FEAR OF MISSING 
OUT. 
THE LONGER YOU ARE ON THE SITE, 
THE MORE YOU ARE LIKELY TO BUY 
SOMETHING. 
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF ELECTRONICS 
AND THINGS LIKE PAPER TOWELS AS 
WELL. 
>> AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE 
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SUMMIT. 
>> THEY EXPECT SALES OF $3.4 
BILLION. 
GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW 
SIGNIFICANT AND HUGE THAT IS 
FOR AMAZON, ITSELF. 
>> IT STARTED AS A FUN EXTRA A 
FEW YEARS AGO. 
THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE ONE 
SPECIAL DAY THAT WAS NOT NEAR 
BLACK FRIDAY, IT WAS IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER. 
IT DID WELL, IT GREW HEAVIER. 
EVERY YEAR THEY SAID IT WAS THE 
BIGGEST DAY EVER. 
>> THAT IS THE POINT, IS THIS, 
THE LITTLE DEAL YOU GET IS ONE 
THING ABOUT THEY LOCK YOU INTO 
THE PRIME MEMBERS OF. 
-- MEMBERSHIP. THE PRICE HAS 
GONE UP AND UP, THEY HAVE TO DO 
MORE AND MORE TO GET YOU LOCKED 
IN. 
>> THEY SEEM TO BE DOING A GOOD 
JOB. 
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
WHOLE FOODS BEING INVOLVED? 
>> WELL OBVIOUSLY AMAZON OWNS A 
WHOLE FOODS NOW. 
IF YOU SPEND $10 AT WHOLE 
FOODS, YOU GET A $10 AMAZON 
COUPON. 
THEY HAVE THE AMAZON ECHO AND.
AND TABLETS IN THERE, THE 
DISCOUNTED PRICES MAKE THEM 
CASUAL PICKUPS. 
>> IT IS UNUSUAL TO SEE AN ECHO 
NEXT TO THE BANANAS. 
ARE THE COMPETITORS ABLE TO 
STAY IN BUSINESS WITH 
COMPETITION LIKE THIS? 
>> THEY CERTAINLY FEEL LIKE 
THEY HAVE TO COMPETE. 
THE FIRST YEAR, A LOT OF STORES 
HAD COUNTER SALES. 
THEY ARE BACK. 
BEST BUY AND TARGET ARE CALLING 
IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN PRIME 
DAY, THEY WILL HAVE THE SPECIAL 
SALES TODAY TOMORROW TO TRY TO 
KEEP UP. 
>>> THE NEW SATIRICAL COMEDY IS 
CALLED SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, IT 
IS BEING CALLED ONE OF THE BIG 
HITS. 
IT DEBUTED AT THE SUNDANCE FILM 
FESTIVAL. 
THEY CALL IT BOLD AND 
UNAPOLOGETICALLY BRILLIANT. 
THE MOVIE IS A BREAKOUT 
DIRECTORIAL DEBUT OF BOOTS RILEY
. IT TELLS THE STORY OF CASH IS 
GREEN, AND OAKLAND MAN WHO 
QUICKLY LEARNS HOW TO CLIMB THE 
CORPORATE LADDER AT A 
TELEMARKETING FIRM. 
>> DO YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME 
MONEY? 
READ THE SCRIPT WITH A WHITE 
VOICE. 
>> PEOPLE SAY I READ IT LIKE 
THAT ALREADY. 
>> I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT WILL 
SMITH, TALK ABOUT THE REAL DEAL.
>> THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS IT IS
VISUALLY GENIUS AND GROUNDED 
AND FUNNY BUT POIGNANT ABOUT 
THE OBSTACLES TO BLACK SUCCESS 
IN AMERICA. 
THE ACCOLADES YOU ARE GETTING 
MUST BE REALLY FUN TO HEAR. 
>> I MEAN, IT IS ALWAYS COME IF 
YOU MAKE A PIECE OF ART AND 
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT AND 
SHOUTING ABOUT IT AND LAUGHING 
OR WHATEVER, YEAH. 
>> I HAD TO WATCH IT TWICE, 
BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME I WAS 
WATCHING IT, I WAS THINKING 
WHAT THE HELL AM I WATCHING? 
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF WHITE 
VOICE MY WHOLE LIFE. 
 
>> HERE'S THE THING, HOW DANNY 
GLOVER'S CHARACTER EXPLAINS IT 
IS THAT THERE IS NO REAL WHITE 
VOICE, EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING 
IS A PERFORMANCE, AND IN THE 
MOVIE, THE WHITE VOICE THAT 
THEY USE IS THIS SORT OF THE 
MYTHICAL THING THAT SAYS 
EVERYTHING IS OKAY. 
THAT IS LIKE THE PERFORMANCE OF 
WHITE FOR SOME FOLKS, LIKE EVEN 
THOUGH I'M MAKING $22,000 A 
YEAR, I'M MIDDLE-CLASS. 
IT'S ALMOST THE OPPOSITE OF THE 
RACIST BLACK TROPES THAT WE SEE 
WHICH IS LIKE, POVERTY IS 
BECAUSE ALL THESE PEOPLE OF 
COLOR ARE, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER, 
SAVAGE. 
>> IT STARTED BECAUSE YOU WERE 
A TELEMARKETER YEARS AGO. 
WHAT DID YOU DRAW FROM THAT? 
>> I SAT IN MY CUBICLE AND 
VOWED REVENGE. 
THIS IS PART OF IT. 
 I WAS DOING 
FUNDRAISING, I WAS ACTUALLY 
RAISING MONEY FOR THE LA 
MISSION FROM THE BAY AREA 
CALLING TO ORANGE COUNTY WHICH 
IS A VERY CONSERVATIVE AREA. 
I WOULD SAY HI. 
HOW ARE YOU DOING. WE'RE JUST 
TAKING A SURVEY AND MAKING 
SURE, DID YOU SUFFER ANY OF THE 
BREAK-INS TODAY? 
SOAK YOUR CAR IS OKAY? 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY I'M CALLING 
FROM THE LOS ANGELES MISSION, 
AND WE HAVE A NEW PLAN TO STOP 
ALL OF THAT. 
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE WANT TO 
GET ALL OF THE POOR PEOPLE, WE 
WANT TO TAKE ALL OF THE 
HOMELESS PEOPLE FROM YOUR 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND MOVE THEM TO 
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. 
WE NEED HELP, BECAUSE WE ARE 
GOING TO HOUSE THEM AND CLOTHE 
THEM AND GIVE THEM JOBS. 
I FELT OKAY ABOUT IT BECAUSE I 
WAS RAISING MONEY FOR A 
HOMELESS MISSION, BUT I ALSO 
FELT TERRIBLE ABOUT IT. 
>> I WILL ASK THIS QUESTION IN 
MY WHITE VOICE. 
 YOU TALK ABOUT 
NURSING THIS GRIEVANCE, BUT 
THIS SCRIPT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE 
TO GET TO THE GATEKEEPERS, TALK 
ABOUT THAT. 
>> I FINISHED WRITING IT IN 
2012. 
WE PUBLISHED IT AS ITS OWN 
PAPERBACK BOOK IN 2014. THEN I 
WENT TO THE SUNDANCE LABS IN 
2015 AND SUNDANCE DIRECTORS LAB 
IN 2016. 
WE SHOT IT LAST YEAR. 
IT HAS BEEN SIX OR 7 YEARS OF, 
WE ARE GOING TO START SHOOTING 
AT THREE MONTHS NOW. 
>> DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT 
GIVING UP? 
>> NO. 
I BASICALLY PAINTED MYSELF INTO 
A CORNER. 
I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE 
GOOD ON THE LIE THAT I WAS 
TELLING WHICH WAS THAT WE WERE 
GOING TO SHOOT A MOVIE. 
>> IT'S AN ABSURD DARK COMEDY 
WITH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE. 
>> I THINK THERE IS AN OPTIMISM 
THAT COMES THROUGH THE MOVIE 
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE WORLD IS 
MESSED UP, THERE IS A WAY TO 
CHANGE IT. 
THERE IS AN ANALYSIS THAT SHOWS 
THAT THE PEOPLE CAN DO THINGS 
LIKE WITHHOLD THEIR LABOR AND 
TAKE HOLD OF THINGS. 
THERE IS AN OPTIMISM THAT COMES 
FROM THAT. 
>> AND SHOCKING TWISTS AND 
TURNS IN THE MOVIE, THAT'S ALL 
I WILL SAY. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY. 
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THE 
SPIRIT. 
>> THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOU 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GUESS 
WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
HE DIDN'T GIVE UP, AND IT IS 
PAYING OFF. 
>>> SARTRE -- SORRY TO BOTHER 
YOU IS IN THEATERS. 
>>> AND WE HAVE LIFE LESSONS 
COMING UP. 
>>> ORIGINAL REPORTING EVERY 
MORNING ON CBS THIS MORNING. 
>>> HELLO. 
I'M A REFUGEE FROM SYRIA. 
HERE IS MY VIDEO JOURNAL. 
I REMEMBER SEEING MY DAD WHEN 
WE SAID GOODBYE TO HIM, HE 
STARTED CRYING, BUT HE TURNED 
AWAY SO THAT WE COULDN'T SEE IT.
LEAVING YOUR HOMELAND FEELS LIKE
LEAVING PART OF YOUR SOUL. 
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IT WAS 
LIKE TO INTEGRATE INTO GERMAN 
SOCIETY? 
>> IT IS LIKE A WAVE, EITHER 
YOU WRITE IT OR YOU FIGHT IT. 
>> MY DREAM IS TO BE A DOCTOR. 
I WANT TO STUDY AT HARVARD. 
I WANT TO GO BACK TO SYRIA AND 
START BUILDING IT. 
THAT IS MY DREAM. 
>>> HELLO EVERYONE. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN ARE 
HOLDING HIGH-STAKES TALKS 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN HELSINKI.
THEY ADDRESSED REPORTERS TODAY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THE WORLD 
WANTS TO SEE THE U.S. AND 
RUSSIA GET ALONG. 
HE CALLED THE NATIONS THE 
WORLD'S GREATEST NUCLEAR 
POWERS. 
THE MEETING COMES JUST DAYS 
AFTER THE U.S. JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT CHARGE 12 RUSSIAN 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS FOR 
HACKING INTO THE DEMOCRATIC 
NATIONAL COMMITTEE DURING THE 
2016 ELECTION. 
HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY EARLIER. 
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS 
TO TALK ABOUT AND THINGS TO 
TALK ABOUT. 
WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON 
EVERYTHING FROM TRADE TO 
MILITARY AND MISSILES AND CHINA
. WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT CHINA. 
OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. 
I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 
OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER. WE 
FRANKLY HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING 
ALONG VERY WELL FOR THE PAST 
FEW YEARS. 
I THINK WE WILL END UP HAVING 
AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP. 
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A 
GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. 
I REALLY THINK THE WORLD WANTS 
TO SEE US GET ALONG. 
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 
POWERS. 
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR. 
THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING. 
THAT'S A BAD THING. 
I THINK WE HOPEFULLY COULD DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. 
IT IS NOT A POSITIVE FORCE, IT 
IS A NEGATIVE FORCE. 
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT 
AMONG OTHER THINGS. 
>> WE SPOKE TO IAN BREHMER 
ABOUT THE MEETING. 
>> HE HAS SET IT UP TO BE A 
GREAT MEETING. IT IS CLEARLY 
GOING TO BE THE WARMEST OF HIS 
TRIP. 
IT REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST TRIP 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE WHERE THE 
BEST PART WAS SAUDI ARABIA. 
I SOON AS HE STARTS WORKING HIS 
WAY TOWARDS EUROPE, THINGS GET 
WORSE. 
IT HAS BECOME AN ENHANCED 
VERSION OF THAT. 
EUROPEAN ALLIES ARE BESIDE 
THEMSELVES WITH DISCONTENT. 
PUTIN IS RELAXED, COOL AS A 
CUCUMBER. 
SITTING BACK. 
LETTING TRUMP DO THE LIFTING. 
I THINK IT WILL BE THE SAME 
THING WHEN THEY DO THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE AFTERWARDS. 
I THINK TRUMP WILL BE TALKING 
AN AWFUL LOT AND PUTIN WILL BE 
HAPPY TO LET HIM. 
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE 
INDICTMENTS IN THE U.S., 12 
INDICTMENTS AGAINST ACTUAL 
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENTS FOR 
HACKING IN THE U.S. ELECTION. 
WE HAVE TRUMP'S OWN CYBER CZAR 
SAYING THAT WE ARE HEADING 
TOWARDS A NEW COLD WAR. 
ALL IN ALL, I DON'T EXPECT IT 
IN A 90 MINUTES OF ONE-ON-ONE, 
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION 
ON IT PERSONALLY ANYWAY. 
>> IF HE DOESN'T BRING UP THIS 
SORT OF STUFF, IS IT BASICALL 
SAYING GO HAD, WE HAVE ANOTHER 
ELECTION COMING UP, DO YOUR 
BEST? 
>> IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE EVEN 
WHAT HE MIGHT SAY FORMALLY. I 
CAN IMAGINE THEM SAYING OKAY, 
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS 
QUESTION, BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT 
TRUMP IS PERSONALLY, AT LEAST 
NOT IN DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT TO THE EXTENT THE RUSSIANS 
WERE INVOLVED, THEY WEREN'T 
HURTING HIM. 
THEY WEREN'T HURTING THE 
REPUBLICANS, THEY WERE HURTING 
THE DEMOCRATS. 
THEY WERE GOING AFTER HILLARY. 
TRUMP CERTAINLY CAN'T SAY 
PUBLICLY THAT HE IS HAPPY ABOUT 
IT, BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW 
PRIVATELY HE IS HAPPY ABOUT 
THAT. 
AND IF RUSH IS GOING TO DO MORE 
OF THAT GOING FORWARD, IT IS 
NOT CLEAR THAT HE HAS A GREAT 
DEAL OF PERSONAL INTEREST IN 
STOPPING THEM. 
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN 
OTHERS IN A CHUMP 
ADMINISTRATION. 
-- TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
>> GIVEN THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT 
OF THE NATO MEETINGS, AND THE 
IDEA THAT FOR SOME BRITONS, HE 
MAY HAVE DERAILED THERESA MAY'S 
GOVERNMENT. 
THE GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID
THAT EUROPE CAN NO LONGER RELY 
ON THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW FOR 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, THERE ARE NO 
EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE HE COMES 
IN WITH SEVERAL WINS IN HIS 
TICK MARK BOX. 
JUST TALK TO US ABOUT THE 
RAMIFICATIONS OF THE TRIP, THE 
NATO SUMMIT, THE MEETING WITH 
THERESA MAY IN THE UK, AND HOW 
IT WILL ALL PLAY OUT IN THE 
MONTHS AHEAD. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CANNOT STAND 
THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
>> HE CALLED IT A FOE. 
>> IT WAS THE FIRST FOE HE 
MENTIONED WITH  JEFF GLOR . IT 
IS A MULTILATERAL INSTITUTION. 
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT A PART 
OF IT. 
IT IS ALLIED WITH AMERICANS. 
BUT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE ON 
DEFENSE, ON TRADE, ON VALUES, 
THESE ARE ALL ISSUES WHERE 
TRUMP WOULD RATHER SEE THE EU 
GO AWAY. 
HE DIRECTLY TOLD THE FRENCH 
PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE 
EU. 
I WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER 
BILATERAL TRADE DEAR -- TRADE 
DEAL THAN HE CAN HAVE OVER 
THERE. 
HE TOLD THERESA MAY, I THINK 
YOU SHOULD BE HANDLING BREXIT A 
LOT TOUGHER. 
MAKE A CLEAN BREAK, AND IF YOU 
DON'T DO THAT,  I AM OUT. 
THERE WILL NOT BE A BILATERAL 
U.S.-UK RELATIONSHIP. 
HE WENT MOST HARD AGAINST 
ANGELA MERKEL. 
HE WANTS TO RIP APART THE 
FABRIC OF THE EU. 
AND ON NATO, HE IS ACTUALLY 
PILING ON AN ALREADY VERY 
WEAKENED INSTITUTION THAT IT 
DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ITS 
PURPOSE IS. 
AT THESE TWO THINGS ARE 
OBVIOUSLY PRINCIPAL GOALS OF 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
HE WANTS A WEAKER EUROPE. 
HE WANTS A DIVIDED 
TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP. 
THAT WAS ALL HAPPENING BEFORE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT DOESN'T 
MATTER. 
HIS PRESIDENCY IS FACILITATING 
THAT. 
AND FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN'S 
PERSPECTIVE, YOU DON'T NEED TO 
SAY ANYTHING. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ARGUMENT THAT HEY, ALL OF A 
SUDDEN THESE NATO MEMBERS ARE 
PROMISING TO ANTE UP. 
CONGRESS IS MAINTAINING THE 
SANCTIONS THAT THE U.S. EXPELLED
A NUMBER OF DIPLOMATS IN LINE 
WITH OTHER ALLIES WHEN THERE 
WAS THE POISONING IN LONDON. 
ESSENTIALLY, THERE IS TALK, BUT 
THE ACTION, THE ACTIONS OF THE 
U.S. ADMINISTRATION ARE 
MAINTAINING A DISCIPLINED POINT 
OF VIEW ON RUSSIA. 
>> THE CHUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 
BEEN TOUGHER OVERALL ON RUSSIA 
THAN OBAMA. 
THAT IS TRUE ON SANCTIONS AND 
KICKING OUT DIPLOMATS. 
THAT IS TRUE ON ARMING THE 
UKRAINIANS AGAINST RUSSIAN 
INTERVENTION. 
HAVING SAID THAT, TRUMP 
PERSONALLY HAS NOT BEEN 
INTERESTED IN PROMOTING ANY OF 
THOSE POLICIES. 
BEHIND THE SCENES, HE HAS 
PUSHED BACK PRETTY HARD AGAINST 
HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION. 
IT IS THE ONE PLACE IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION WHERE YOU SEE A 
VERY CLEAR AND DEFINABLE BREAK 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
LITERALLY EVERYBODY ELSE. 
IT IS STRANGE. 
ON NATO, DID ACTUALLY ASK FOR 
MORE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE 
NATO ALLIES AND IF THEY WERE 
PRINTED -- IF THEY WERE 
PREPARED TO GIVE IT TO THEM, 
PUTIN WOULDN'T LIKE THAT. 
AND WHEN HE KICKED THE GEORGIAN 
AND UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTS OUT OF 
THE ROOM, HE SAID THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M 
GOING TO TALK ABOUT. 
THE LEADERS SAID WE CAN'T MAKE 
THIS HAPPEN. 
VISIT EVEN IF WE WANTED TO GIVE 
MORE MONEY, WE WOULD HAVE TO 
GET APPROVAL FROM OUR OWN 
HOMEGROWN PARLIAMENTS AT WHICH 
POINT TRUMP TURNS TO THE 
TURKISH PRESIDENT, NOT EXACTLY 
A PROPONENT OF LIBERAL 
DEMOCRACY. 
HE SAYS EXCEPT HE DOES THIS AT 
THE RIGHT WAY AND HE JUST BUMPS 
THE TURKISH PRESIDENT. 
I SWEAR. 
YOU ARE GIGGLY BECAUSE IT'S 
DISBELIEF. 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'VE HEARD 
FROM THE ALLIED COUNTRIES 
SITTING AT THE ROOM AROUND THE 
TABLE. 
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. 
AS MUCH AS THEY CONTINUE TO TRY 
TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE WAY 
TRUMP OPERATES, THEIR CAPACITY 
TO CONTINUE TO BE SURPRISED BY 
HIM IN THE FLESH, WHEN HE MAKES 
DETERMINATIONS LIKE THIS, THE 
FACT THAT HE, WHEN WE FIRST SAT 
DOWN AND TALKED ABOUT THE 
SECOND MEETING THAT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN AND TRUMP HAD AT THE G 20 
THAN HER. 
THE ALLIES WERE SO CONCERNED, 
BECAUSE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ALL 
OF THEM, HE HAD NO CONCERN 
ABOUT THE RADICALLY MORE 
FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP WITH 
LATIMER PUTIN THAN HE DID WITH 
ANY AMERICAN ALLY. 
HE SHOWED THAT THE TURKISH 
PRESIDENT, WHO IS BASICALLY 
CREATING A SOFT AUTHORITARIAN 
REGIME DOES THINGS THE RIGHT WAY
, AND THE EUROPEAN LEADERS, THE 
ALLIES, THE TRUE ALLIES OF THE 
UNITED STATES WHO HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH PARLIAMENTS AND HAVE 
RULE OF LAW, THEY DO THINGS THE 
WRONG WAY. 
THE TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
NOT INTERESTED IN ANY WAY IN 
RULE OF LAW AND INDEPENDENT 
JUDICIARY, BALANCE OF POWER. 
HIS PERSONAL PREDILECTIONS ARE 
TOWARDS MORE AUTHORITARIAN RULE.
WE ARE SEEING THAT TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN. 
AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO SAY 
YOU DON'T, WE ARE GOING TO 
LISTEN TO WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY 
SAYING. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU AT 
FACE VALUE. 
>> SOME FASCINATING AND PERHAPS 
ALARMING ANALYSIS. 
>>> NEWLY RELEASED BODY CAM 
VIDEO SHOWS THE MOMENTS THE 
MOMENTS BEFORE THE DEADLY 
POLICE SHOOTING IN CHICAGO. 
THE MAN REACHED FOR HIS GUN 
BEFORE AN OFFICER OPENED FIRE 
AND KILLED HIM. 
>> SEVERAL DEMONSTRATORS WERE 
ARRESTED AFTER CLASH WITH 
AUTHORITIES NEAR THE SHOOTING 
SCENE. 
AN IN THE SILENT POLICE VIDEO, 
POLICE OFFICERS APPROACH ON THE 
SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO SIDEWALK. 
HE PULLS AWAY WHEN ONE OFFICER 
TRIES TO GRAB HIS WRIST. 
IT REVEALED WHAT POLICE SAY IS 
A SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPON ON HIS 
RIGHT HIP. 
AN OFFICER OPENED FIRE WHEN HE 
APPEARED TO REACH FOR A GUN. 
>> THE DECISION TO USE LETHAL 
FORCE IS MADE IN A SPLIT SECOND.
>> PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM SAY HE 
WORKED AS A BARBER AND HAD A 5-
YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. 
>> PEOPLE ARE ANGRY BECAUSE 
THIS WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
COMMUNITY. 
HE WASN'T A BAD PERSON. 
>> DEMONSTRATORS CONVERGED 
THROWING BOTTLES AND TRASH AND 
JUMPING ON A SQUAD CAR AND 
CLASHING WITH OFFICERS WHO 
RESPONDED WITH BATONS. 
THERE WERE FOUR ARREST AND SOME 
OFFICERS WERE HURT. 
YESTERDAY, DOZENS GATHERED 
AGAIN FOR A MARCH. 
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE COME 
TOGETHER AS A PEOPLE. 
>> Reporter: SOME PROTESTERS 
SAID SATURDAY'S INCIDENT WAS 
REMINISCENT OF THE DEADLY 
POLICE SHOOTING OF 17-YEAR-OLD 
McDONALD IN 2014. 
HE WAS SHOT 16 TIMES AS HE 
WALKED AWAY FROM POLICE. 
HE WAS ARMED ONLY WITH A POCKET 
KNIFE. 
POLICE VIDEO OF THE INCIDENT 
WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC FOR MORE 
THAN A YEAR. 
POLICE SAY VIDEO OF SATURDAY'S 
SHOOTING SHOWS A KEY 
DIFFERENCE. 
>> THIS WAS NOT AN UNARMED 
INDIVIDUAL. 
WHY HE CHOSE TO DO WHAT HE DID, 
I DON'T KNOW. 
>> LET'S BRING IN DEAN REYNOLDS.
WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION TO 
THIS NEW VIDEO? 
>> Reporter: I THINK IT LOWERED 
THE TEMPERATURE CONSIDERABLY. 
JUST LOOKING AT THE 
DEMONSTRATIONS LAST NIGHT AS 
COMPARED TO THOSE ON SATURDAY 
NIGHT, THE ONES LAST NIGHT 
INVOLVED A FEW DOZEN PEOPLE, 
AND THERE WERE NO MAJOR 
INCIDENCES. 
ON SATURDAY NIGHT, WHEN THE 
RUMORS WERE SPREADING THAT THE 
SUSPECT HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE 
BACK AS HE FLED, THOSE RUMORS 
STOPED A LOT OF TENSIONS AND 
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF 
CONFRONTATION WITH THE POLICE. 
THE VIDEO, AS THE POLICE 
RELEASED IT SHOWS A DIFFERENT 
STORY. 
THAT DID LOWER THE TEMPERATURE 
ON THE STREET. 
>> WILL THEY RELEASE MORE 
VIDEOS? 
>> EDDIE JOHNSON, THE 
SUPERINTENDENT SAID THERE IS A 
TON OF VIDEO PRESUMABLY WITH 
OTHER BODY CAMERA VIDEO AND 
PERHAPS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO IN 
THE AREA WHERE THE SHOOTING 
TOOK PLACE. 
IT IS LIKELY THAT WE ARE GOING 
TO SEE DIFFERENT ANGLES OF THIS 
SAME INCIDENT. 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN. 
>> I WAS GOING TO SUCCUMB OFTEN 
WITH VIDEO, EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE 
ARE LOOKING AT THE IMAGES, THEY 
ARE STILL HAVING DEBATES. 
PEOPLE STILL WONDER IF WHAT 
THEY ARE SEEING IS ACTUALLY 
WHAT THE POLICE ARE SAYING. 
I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS POLICE. 
WE COULD SEE THAT THE PROTESTS 
CONTINUED EVEN AFTER THE VIDEO 
WAS RELEASED. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
AND LISA SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON 
AS WELL AS THE POLICE IN 
GENERAL ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO 
THE EMOTIONS ON THE STREET NOW. 
THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF WHAT 
TOOK PLACE BACK IN 2014 WHEN 
LOOK JUAN McDONALD WAS SHOT 16 
TIMES BY A POLICEMAN AND THE 
VIDEO OF THAT INCIDENT WAS NOT 
RELEASED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. 
JOHNSON SAID IT WAS INCUMBENT 
ON HIM TO TRY TO CALM THE 
SITUATION. 
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WAS TO 
RELEASE THIS VIDEO. 
THERE WERE DEMONSTRATIONS LAST 
NIGHT, BUT IT WAS NOTHING LIKE 
WHAT HAPPENED ON SATURDAY NIGHT
. VERY LITTLE OF THE ANGER THAT 
WAS TAKING PLACE ON SATURDAY 
NIGHT CARRIED OVER INTO SUNDAY. 
>> WE EXPECT MORE PROTESTS 
TODAY? 
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THERE ARE. 
BUT IT'S VERY EARLY IN THE 
MORNING HERE IN CHICAGO. 
THERE MAY BE OTHER 
DEMONSTRATIONS. 
LIKE I SAID, THE RELEASE OF 
THAT VIDEO WAS TIMED TO LOWER 
THE TEMPERATURE ON THE STREET 
AND TO DISPEL MISINFORMATION 
THAT WAS OUT THERE. IT APPEARS 
TO HAVE DONE WHAT IT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO DO. 
>>> COMING UP, WHILE THE THAI 
SOCCER TEAM CONTINUES TO

INCREDIBLE STORY OF SURVIVAL.

>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
PRESIDENT NEWTON OUR MEETING 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN 
HELSINKI, FINLAND. 
THEY ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD A 
JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE AFTER 
TALKS. 
WE ARE LIVE FROM HELSINKI. 
PUT THIS MEETING IN CONTEXT. 
WHAT IS AT STAKE? I THINK IT IS 
HARD TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY 
WHAT'S AT STAKE, BECAUSE WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS ON THE 
AGENDA. 
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE
. FIRST THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS, AND 
THEN THE EXTENDED MEETING WHERE 
LOTS OF IT ADVISORS WILL BE IN 
THE ROOM TO TRY TO HASH OUT 
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SET IN 
MOTION. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR WHATEVER 
REASON HAS BEEN COMPLETELY 
VAGUE ABOUT HIS OWN INTENTIONS 
GOING IN TO THIS SUMMIT. 
WHAT ISSUES DOES HE CARE TO 
DRIVE WITH THE RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT? 
WHAT INTERESTS OF THE UNITED 
STATES IS HE GOING TO BRING THE 
BEAR UP AGAINST A RUSSIAN 
LEADER, AND WHAT IS HE GOING TO 
EXTRACT IN TERMS OF CONCESSIONS 
FROM THE RUSSIANS? 
OR TO GET THEM SOMETHING TO 
LIVE UP TO AGREEMENTS THEY'VE 
ALREADY MADE WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT IN PLACES FOR EXAMPLE 
LIKE SYRIA? 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS OUT OF THIS 
MEETING. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS UNTIL 
YESTERDAY WHEN HE DECLARED THIS 
A SUMMIT ON TWITTER, ALL OF HIS 
SENIOR ADVISORS PUBLICLY AND 
PRIVATELY WERE SAYING TO 
REPORTERS LIKE ME, DON'T CALL 
THIS A SUMMIT. 
IT IS A MEETING. 
A SUMMIT HAS TOO BIG OF AN 
AGENDA AND SETS EXPECTATIONS 
TOO HIGH. 
THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS IT A 
SUMMIT. 
THAT SUGGESTS A COUPLE OF 
THINGS. 
ONE IS A DECOUPLING FROM HIS 
ADVISORS ABOUT HOW TO SET 
EXPECTATIONS AND ALSO, IT 
SUGGESTS THAT EVEN WHEN THOSE 
CLOSEST TO THE PRESENT ARE 
TRYING TO HELP HIM BY 
MAINTAINING A LOW LEVEL OF 
EXPECTATIONS, THE PRESIDENT 
EITHER DOESN'T TAKE THE HELP 
SERIOUSLY OR DEFIES IT FOR HIS 
OWN REASON. 
I CAN TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS IN 
BRUSSELS TALKING TO MINISTERS 
OF NATO EACH AND EVERY MOMENT 
THAT HE SPENDS WITH PUTIN 
RAISES THE ANXIETY HERE BACK 
HOME, BECAUSE IN THIS 
STATECRAFT, PUTIN IS A MUCH 
MORE EXPERIENCED NEGOTIATOR. 
HE KNOWS WHAT HIS AGENDA IS 
ANTI-DRIVES HIS BARGAIN HIS 
WAY. 
CAPABLE OF A FLATTERING, NOT 
JUST AS PRESIDENT, BUT OTHER 
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND GETTING 
HIS WAY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. 
SO THAT IS A CONSTRUCT THAT 
CREATES SOME DEGREE OF ANXIETY 
AMONG AMERICAN ALLIES. 
WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN IN 
THIS PRIVATE ENCOUNTER AND WHAT 
WILL VLADIMIR PUTIN SAY ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF IT IN TERMS OF 
ISSUES? 
BY ENTERING WITH A VAGUE AGENDA
, IT CREATES AN OPENING, AT 
LEAST AN OPENING FOR VLADIMIR 
PUTIN TO GET MORE OF WHAT HE 
WANTS BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE 
DEFINED IT UPFRONT. 
>> WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE 
SAYING ABOUT THE VAGUE AGENDA 
ONE FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS IN 
CONGRESS, THERE COULD BE A 
COUPLE SPECIFIC THINGS THE 
PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS TO TALK 
ABOUT. 
HE COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 
ABOUT THE POISONING OF UK 
CITIZENS ON THEIR SOIL. 
YOU COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 
ABOUT THE 12 RUSSIAN 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS THAT 
WERE JUST INDICTED BY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
BUT HE LEFT IT TO, WE WILL TALK 
ABOUT CHINA AND TALK ABOUT 
NUCLEAR. 
WE WANT TO HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE 
RESPONDING TO THAT LINE OF 
THINKING FROM OTHER AMERICANS? 
>> THAT THE PRESIDENT SETS THE 
AGENDA. 
HE IS THE DEALMAKER AND WHAT HE 
SAYS GOES. 
THAT IS GOING BACK TO THIS 
DECOUPLING I TALKED ABOUT. 
WILL WE DESCRIBE THIS AS A 
SUMMIT OR MEETING. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKED OVERTIME 
TO SAY IT'S JUST A MEETING. 
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT CALLS IT 
A SUMMIT. 
THAT MEANS HE IS RUNNING THE 
SHOW. 
HE IS AT THE TOP AND HE DEFINES 
HIS OWN REALITY AND DEFINES 
WHATEVER THE CONTOURS OF WHAT 
HE WANTS TO NEGOTIATE IN THE 
MOMENT AT THAT TIME. 
THEN HE LEAVES IT TO HIS 
ADVISORS TO TRY TO SORT OUT AND 
COPE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. 
LET'S REMIND US HOW THAT PLAYED 
OUT IN SINGAPORE. 
NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION 
EXPECTED THE PRESIDENT TO GIVE 
UP A JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES 
WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN 
GOVERNMENT. 
YET HE DID. 
WHEN HE ANNOUNCED IT, IT 
SURPRISED THE SOUTH KOREANS AND 
THE PENTAGON AND OUR JAPANESE 
ALLIES. 
YET THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. 
HE MADE A DEAL IN THE MOMENT 
FACE-TO-FACE WITH KIM JONG-UN. 
AND EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO ADAPT 
AFTERWARDS. 
IN SO ANNOUNCING THE END OF THE 
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP USED THE VERY 
LANGUAGE THE NORTH KOREAN 
REGIME HAD USED. 
THEY WERE PROVOCATIVE. 
THAT IS AN EXAMPLE, A CLASSIC 
THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE 
EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN 
THESE ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT WALKS IN AND 
THOSE AROUND THEM DON'T KNOW 
HIS AGENDA AND THEY DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HE WILL AGREE TO. 
HE AGREES TO IT AND TURNS 
AROUND TO EVERYONE ELSE AND 
SAYS MAKE IT WORK. 
THERE IS SOME ANTICIPATION HERE,
WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING 
TO TURN AROUND AND SAY TO HIS 
ADVISORS AFTER THIS LENGTHY 
MEETING WITH PUTIN, THAT'S WHAT 
I AGREED TO, MAKE IT WORK. 
BUT WE SEE NO INDICATION THAT 
HE IS PASSIONATELY OR 
POETICALLY MOTIVATED TO DRIVE 
THIS RUSSIAN MEDDLING HARD TO 
PAST OR PRESENT. 
AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN 
SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS ABOUT WHAT 
TO SAY ABOUT RUSSIAN INCURSION 
IN CRIMEA. 
THEY HAVEN'T SAID THEY 
RECOGNIZED IT OFFICIALLY BUT 
THEY HAVEN'T RULED IT OUT. 
THAT IS AN OPENING FOR THE 
RUSSIANS. 
I CAN TELL YOU IN BRUSSELS, 
ANOTHER BIG TOPIC, IT IS NOT A 
HUGE ISSUE, BUT ONE CENTRAL TO 
THE FUTURE OF THE NATO 
ALLIANCE, JOINT MILITARY 
EXERCISES IN THE BALTICS. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS THOSE TWO 
AND. 
-- WANTS THOSE TO END. 
>> WITH IDENTIFIED IN THE 12 
RUSSIAN OFFICERS WERE CHARGED 
WITH HACKING INTO THE DNC, I 
THINK MY QUESTION IS, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT HE 
MIGHT RING IT UP. 
IT'S NOT REALLY ON THE TOP OF 
THE AGENDA, BUT WHAT CAN HE 
REALLY SAY? 
WHAT ARE HIS OPTIONS? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY TOLD 
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO CUT IT OUT 
AND IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A 
DIFFERENCE. 
>> WHEN IT COMES TO OPTIONS, 
YOU CAN USE THE VOICE OF 
AMERICA, THE PRESIDENCY OF THE 
UNITED STATES, AND AS THE 
ESSENTIALLY REPOSITORY AT THE 
TOP OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY 
TO SAY WE IN AMERICA CARE ABOUT 
DEMOCRACY AND WE WILL PROTECT 
IT. 
YOU INVITED -- YOU INVADED IT. 
THE FACTS ARE REAL. 
THIS HAPPENED AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS OF YOUR GOVERNMENT. 
WE KNOW IT, YOU SHOULD KNOW 
THAT WE KNOW IT, AND WE WILL 
TAKE EVERY SINGLE STEP WE CAN 
TO STOP IT IN THE FUTURE. 
THAT IS NOT A CONTROVERSIAL 
THING TO SAY. 
IT IS A DIRECT FORCEFUL 
RESPONSE TO A HOSTILE ACT BY A 
HOSTILE GOVERNMENT. 
MANY IN CONGRESS HAVE ASKED FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO SAY PRECISELY 
THOSE WORDS AND SAY THEM IN 
PUBLIC AND REINFORCE THEM IN 
PRIVATE. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THE AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT CAN DO WHICH IT IS 
SLOW TO HAVE DONE UNDER THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS FORTIFY 
CYBER DEFENSES, GATHER ALL OF 
THE STATES VARIOUS ELECTION 
OFFICES AND SECRETARY OF STATE 
AND HELP THEM FORTIFY THEIR 
DEFENSES. 
MAKE IT A PROJECT TO MONITOR 
AND INTERCEPT AND CALL OUT 
PUBLICLY ANY FUTURE EFFORTS BY 
THE RUSSIANS. 
ALL OF THOSE ARE OPTIONS 
AVAILABLE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
MANY IN CONGRESS IN BOTH 
PARTIES ARE HOPEFUL HE WILL 
MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. 
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT HIS 
DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL AND 
FOCUS, WE CAN HEAR THAT THERE 
IS ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT VERY 
CLOSE TALKING VERY LOUD. 
YOU STATE FOCUS ON US. 
>> WE APPRECIATE THAT AS 
ALWAYS. 
AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT, WITH 
REGARDS TO HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS TREATING THIS MEETING AND 
TREATING THE RUSSIANS, HE 
TWEETED EARLIER, OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA HAS 
NEVER BEEN WORSE THANKS TO MANY 
YEARS OF U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND 
STUPIDITY, AND NOW THE RIGGED 
WITCHHUNT, THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTRY OF AFFAIRS, THROUGH 
THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT 
RESPONDED, WE AGREE. 
>> IT IS REMARKABLE TO THINK OF 
THAT. 
THAT IS PART OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S SENSE OF HIMSELF AND A 
SENSE OF HIS PRESIDENCY AS 
BEING SO DIFFERENT FROM ANY 
PRESIDENCY THAT CAME BEFORE. 
ON THIS AND SO MANY OTHER 
ISSUES. 
IT'S AS IF THE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENCY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE 
HE ARRIVED THERE OR IF IT DID, 
IT WAS SO MISDIRECTED AND SO 
FOOLISH, SO STUPID THAT IT IS 
THE CAUSE OF ALL CURRENT 
PROBLEMS HE IS TRYING TO SORT 
OUT. 
NOTHING COULD PLEASE THE 
RUSSIANS MORE THAN TO HAVE THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
AS HE WALKS INTO A PRIVATE 
MEETING WITH PUTIN ESSENTIALLY 
EMBRACE THEIR INTERPRETATION. 
IT IS NOT US. 
IT'S NOT US INVADING UKRAINE 
AND TAKING OVER CRIMEA. IT IS 
NOT AS RIGGING AGREEMENTS WE 
MADE WITH YOU IN SYRIA. 
IT IS NOT US MEDDLING IN YOUR 
ELECTIONS PAST AND POSSIBLY 
PRESENT. 
IT IS NOT US, AS YOU MENTIONED, 
POISONING A BRITISH CITIZEN IN 
BRITAIN. NONE OF THOSE THINGS 
HAVE HARMED THE U.S. 
RELATIONSHIP. IT'S THE PAST 
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. 
FOR THAT, VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD 
HAVE ALMOST WANT TO EXTEND A 
METAPHORICAL AND LITERAL 
BOUQUET OF THANKS. 
IT COULDN'T HAVE SET A BETTER 
PREDICATE FOR THE CONVERSATION. 
IT IS MORE THAN HALFWAY TO WHAT 
THE RUSSIANS ALREADY BELIEVE 
ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THE 
RELATIONSHIP. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>> BEFORE THE MEETING, HE 
SPOKE WITH JEFF GLOR  IN 
SCOTLAND. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR GOAL FROM THE 
MEETING? 
>> I WILL LET YOU KNOW AFTER 
THE MEETING. 
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY, IT WAS 
MUTUALLY AGREED, LET'S HAVE A 
MEETING. 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING TO 
ME. 
I DO BELIEVE IN MEETINGS. 
I BELIEVE THAT HAVING A MEETING 
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS A GOOD 
THING. 
I THINK HAVING MEETINGS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA WAS A 
VERY GOOD THING. 
HAVING MEETINGS WITH RUSSIA AND 
CHINA AND NORTH KOREA, I 
BELIEVE IT. 
NOTHING BAD IS GOING TO COME 
OUT OF IT. 
AND MAYBE SOME GOOD WILL COME 
OUT. 
BUT I GO IN WITH LOW 
EXPECTATIONS. 
I'M NOT GOING WITH HIGH 
EXPECTATIONS. 
I DON'T REALLY, I CAN'T TELL 
YOU WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I WILL 
BE ASKING FOR. 
WE WILL SEE IF SOMETHING COMES 
OF IT. 
>> THE RUSSIANS INDICTED, WOULD 
YOU ASK HIM TO SEND THEM HERE? 
>> I MIGHT. 
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. 
BUT I WILL BE ASKING ABOUT IT. 
BUT THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THEY WERE DOING WHATEVER IT WAS 
DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING 
OR PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HACK 
INTO THE RNC, THE REPUBLICAN 
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, BUT WE HAD 
MUCH BETTER DEFENSES. 
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 
HACKED. 
THEY HAD A BAD DEFENSES, AND 
THEY WERE ABLE TO BE HACKED. 
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING 
TO HACK THE REPUBLICANS AS 
WELL. 
AND THIS MAY BE WRONG, BUT THEY 
HAD MUCH STRONGER DEFENSES. 
>> AND JEFF GLOR IS HERE WITH 
US NOW.  
THIS WAS SUCH A FASCINATING 
INTERVIEW. 
I KNOW YOU WILL INTERVIEW THE 
PRESIDENT AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY, 
YOUR MEET AND GREET MADE 
HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD, 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES SUGGESTED THAT 
HIS OPPONENTS WERE THE EUROPEAN 
UNION AND HE CALLED RUSSIA A 
COMPETITOR. 
>> IT CAME UP WHILE WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT NATO, I SAID WHO 
WAS YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITOR 
RIGHT NOW? 
THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS THE 
EUROPEAN UNION. 
HE FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH CHINA 
AND RUSSIA AS WELL. 
AND I FOLLOWED UP, I SAID SOME 
PEOPLE MAY BE SURPRISED TO HEAR 
YOU SAY THE EU FIRST. 
HE REALLY DOUBLE DOWN. 
THERE IS THIS INTENSE FOCUS 
RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO 
INCREASE NATO PAYMENTS. 
AND REDOING THESE TRADE DEALS. 
IN THAT SENSE, I BELIEVE THAT 
THIS WHITE HOUSE AND PRESIDENCY 
THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A FAUX IN 
THAT SENSE, THAT IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO, 
NOT AN ENEMY IN WAR, BUT 
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THEY 
BELIEVE HAS TO BE DEALT WITH 
IMMEDIATELY. 
>> DO YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT 
HE WOULD CONSIDER A WIN COMING 
OUT OF THIS? 
>> HE DOES LIKE THESE ONE-ON-
ONE SETTINGS. 
AND HE BELIEVES THAT HE CAN GET 
A READ ON SOMEONE FAIRLY 
QUICKLY, BUT THAT YOU GET TO 
KNOW SOMEONE EVEN BETTER THE 
MORE TIME YOU SPEND WITH THEM. 
SO I DO THINK THAT WHETHER IT 
IS VLADIMIR PUTIN OR ANGELA 
MERKEL OR EMMANUEL McCRONE, 
WHEREVER THOSE RELATIONSHIPS 
HAVE GONE, HE WANTS TO SPEND 
MORE TIME. 
DOES HE WANT TO HAVE MORE OF AN 
OPEN CONVERSATION AND SEE HOW 
IT GOES? 
YES. 
I THINK SO. 
DOES VLADIMIR PUTIN PROBABLY 
HAVE MORE CONCRETE AGENDA IN 
TERMS OF DELIVERABLES THAT HE 
WANTS? 
YES. 
ARE THOSE WORKABLE BETWEEN THEM?
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE, SURE. 
BUT WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE IS WHO BOTH OF THEM, 
PRESIDENT -- ESPECIALLY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAK TO AFTER 
BEFORE GOING TO THE JOINT PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
ALSO HOW LONG THE PRESS 
CONFERENCES. 
THERE WAS THIS FASCINATING 
EXHAUSTIVE LONG PRESS 
CONFERENCE AFTER SINGAPORE. 
IT WAS AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES, 
WILL THAT HAPPEN POST PUTIN? 
WHAT WILL HE SAY? 
>> THE OTHER INTERESTING THING, 
YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT THE RUSSIAN 
NATIONALS WHO HAVE BEEN 
INDICTED. 
THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T HAVE 
AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH 
RUSSIA. 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE 
INDIVIDUALS TO FACE JUSTICE IS 
TO HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES TO ASK THE 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT AND HE SAID 
HE HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT. 
>> NOT JUST ONES WERE INDICTED 
IN THIS ROUND, BUT IN THE LAST 
ROUND AS WELL. 
YOUR TALK ABOUT A COUPLE DOZEN 
WHO WOULD BE EXTRADITED. 
IT IS HARD TO SEE A WORLD IN 
WHICH PUTIN WOULD SEND THEM 
HERE. 
BUT THE QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH 
PRESSURE IS APPLIED, HOW THAT 
RIP QUEST -- HOW THAT REQUEST 
IS MADE AND IF THERE IS ANY 
WIGGLE ROOM. IT IS HARD TO SEE 
THAT HAPPENING IN ANY WAY. 
BUT HE SAID HE WOULD THINK 
ABOUT IT. 
>> IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN IT COMES 
TO RUSSIAN MEDDLING, IT IS 
CONNECTED TO THE RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATION FOR HIM. 
HE CAN'T SEPARATE THE TWO OF 
THEM. 
HE REPEATEDLY CALLED IT A WITCH 
HUNT AGAIN. 
>> I DO THINK THE SEPARATION 
FROM IT, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 
TO TALK ABOUT, THE MEDDLING IN 
THE RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IS ONE 
THING, I THINK HE SAYS IT IS A 
WITCH HUNT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT 
HOW IT IS GOING AFTER HIM IN 
PARTICULAR. 
THAT HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY DO 
ANYTHING WRONG. 
HOWEVER YOU DEBATE, HOW MUCH 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AFFECTED 
OUR ELECTION, BUT THE 
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS WHAT 
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE SAID, WE ARE AT 
THIS CRITICAL POINT AGAIN WHEN 
IT COMES TO OUR DIGITAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE. 
HE THINKS WE ARE AT THIS POINT 
LIKE WE WERE PRE-9/11 IN TERMS 
OF CLOSE TO A POTENTIAL MAJOR 
BAD ATTACK. 
THOSE ARE THE SIGNS THAT THEY 
ARE SEEING FROM THE RUSSIANS 
AND NORTH KOREANS IN TERMS OF 
WHAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO 
PENETRATE. 
>> AND THE NORTH KOREANS. 
>> THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IS 
EVIDENT IN YOU. 
YOU CARRY OUT TERROR ATTACKS IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS THAN YOU DID 20 
YEARS AGO. 
I ASKED HIM ABOUT WHAT THE D 
AND I SAID. 
HE SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THAT. 
I THINK SOME OF THE COMMENTS 
HAVE BEEN INTERESTING. 
>> YOU PLAN TO INTERVIEW HIM ON 
WEDNESDAY, GIVEN WHAT HE SAID 
THIS WEEKEND AND WE EXPECT TO 
SEE COME OUT OF THIS RUSSIA 
MEETING, GIVE US A PREVIEW. 
>> WE WILL ASK HIM ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED IN HELSINKI AND WHAT 
HIS SENSE OF, HE WILL HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE TIMES. 
I THINK WHAT IS INTERESTING AND 
APPEALING FOR US IS WE GET A 
CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE WHEN I THINK HE HAS 
HAD A CHANCE TO RESET A LITTLE 
BIT BACK HERE. 
AND TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THINGS 
GO POST MEETING AND POST SUMMIT.
WHATEVER YOU CARE TO CALL IT. 
AFTER THAT, WHAT COMES NEXT WITH
VLADIMIR PUTIN NOW THAT THEY 
WILL HAVE MET 3 1/2 TIMES. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING BODY 
LANGUAGE. 
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE REALLY HAD. 
SO I WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM 
YOU, THAT HE SEEMED RELAXED? 
>> IT'S THE SAME. 
THE PRESIDENT PREFERS TO SIT 
FORWARD LIKE THIS. 
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS A LITTLE 
BIT MORE, HE HAD HIS LIEN. 
IT WAS THE SAME. 
THE WAY I EXPECTED HIM TO SIT 
IN ALL OF THESE, AND FOR ME, 
SITTING ACROSS, I'M TRYING TO 
BE COMFORTABLE AND MAKE SURE 
WHOEVER IT IS I'M COMFORTABLE, 
THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE. 
YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THE BODY 
LANGUAGE ALL DAY LONG. 
WHETHER IT IS THIS OR WHETHER 
IT IS VLADIMIR PUTIN AND TRUMP 
MEETING. 
IT IS SUPER FASCINATING TO 
SPECULATE ABOUT. 
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT 
ACTUALLY MEANS. 
BUT IT IS INTERESTING. 
>> WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS 
INTERVIEW ON WEDNESDAY. 
>> WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE 
TONIGHT ON THE EVENING NEWS. 
WE HAVE YET TO RELEASE MOST OF 
THIS INTERVIEW. 
THERE IS MORE TO COME. 
I THINK YOU WILL SEE THE 
PRESIDENT GET A LITTLE MORE 
REFLECTIVE AND THERE IS OTHER 
NEWS THAT I THINK MIGHT BE 
MADE. 
>>> WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> SO THE TRUMP AND PUTIN 
MEETING HAS BEEN OVER TWO 
HOURS. 
>>> NEARLY A YEAR AFTER TWO 
DEADLY HURRICANES WREAKED HAVOC 
ON PUERTO RICO, MORE THAN 
100,000 HOMES AND BUSINESS ARE 
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. 
THEY PROMISED IT WOULD BE 
RESTORED TWO MONTHS AGO, BUT 
VOLUNTEERS ARE CONTINUING TO 
DELIVER SUPPLIES. 
>> ALMOST 200 GENERATORS ARE 
BEING USED TO PROVIDE POWER TO 
KEY LOCATIONS ON THE ISLAND. 
THE GOVERNOR IS WARNING THAT 
THE POWER GRID IS STILL SHAKY 
AND SAYS THERE IS NO BACKUP 
SYSTEM IN CASE ELECTRICITY GOES 
OUT AGAIN. 
>>> THE 12 BOYS AND SOCCER 
COACH WHO WERE RESCUED ARE 
RECOVERING WELL IN THE HOSPITAL 
AND THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
DISCHARGED THIS WEEK. 
>> YOU BASICALLY TURNED ON MY 
ALEXA. [
>> LET'S SHOW THE PHOTOS OF THE 
BOYS. 
THEY ARE IN GOOD SPIRITS. 
THEY CAN BE SEEN HUGGING THE 
THAI NAVY SEAL WHO TOOK CARE OF 
THEM. 
FOUR HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY THE 
BOYS ARE DOING WELL. 
SOME LOST AS MUCH AS 11 POUNDS 
ARE STARTING TO GAIN THE WEIGHT 
BACK. 
MEANWHILE, THEIR PARENTS WERE 
BACK AT THE CAVE TODAY THIS 
TIME FOR CEREMONY. 
VOLUNTEERS ALONG WITH THE 
FAMILIES GATHERED AT THE CAVE 
IN THAILAND MONDAY WHERE THE 12 
BOYS AND THEIR SOCCER COACH 
WERE RESCUED AFTER BEING 
TRAPPED FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.
THE CAVE HAS BEEN CLOSED EVER 
SINCE THE LAST BOY WAS PULLED 
OUT. 
THERE ARE PLANS TO MAKE IT INTO 
AN INTERACTIVE MUSEUM. 
BUT FOR NOW, EVERYONE IS 
GRATEFUL. 
DANCERS PART IN A TIE RITUAL AT 
THE CAVE WHILE MONKS HELD A 
BUDDHIST CLEANSING RITUAL. 
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
CAVE WHERE THE FAMILIES OF THE 
BOYS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE COME TO PAY RESPECT. 
A MEMORIAL SERVICE WAS HELD FOR 
THE THAI NAVY SEAL WHO DIED 
DURING THE RESCUE MISSION. 
NEW PHOTOS SHOW THE 12 BOYS 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE SEAL FROM 
THEIR HOSPITAL ROOM. 
THE BOYS BOWED THEIR HEADS AS 
THEY SURROUNDED A DRAWING OF 
THE DIVER. 
SOME LATER WIPED AWAY TEARS. 
EARLIER, THE GOVERNMENT 
RELEASED THESE VIDEO CLIPS OF 
THE BOYS WHO SAID THEY WERE 
FEELING WELL AND THANKED THE 
RESCUERS. 
THAI OFFICIALS HOPE OF THE 
ENTIRE GROUP WILL GO HOME BY 
THURSDAY. 
THE PARENTS ACTUALLY WENT INTO 
THE CAVE THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE THE BOYS WERE 
RESCUED. 
ONE FATHER TOLD US IT WAS VERY 
SPOOKY FOR HIM, BECAUSE HE HAD 
BEEN REPAIRING HIMSELF FOR THE 
IDEA THAT HIS SON MIGHT NEVER 
EMERGE ALIVE FROM THE CAVE 
AGAIN. 
>>> AND OREGON WOMAN WHO 
DISAPPEARED A WEEK AGO WAS 
FOUND ALIVE AT THE BOTTOM OF AN 
OCEANSIDE CLIFF. 
THE WOMAN'S SUV PLUNGED OVER THE
CLIFF ON THE PACIFIC COAST 
LINE. 
SHE MANAGED TO SURVIVE IT FOR 
SEVEN DAYS BEFORE SHE WAS FOUND.
>> WE FOUND A BUMPER FIRST, AND 
WE SAID THERE IS A BUMPER, 
THAT'S WEIRD. 
WE CAME AROUND ANOTHER BEND AND 
SAW THE CAR. 
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE CAR 
THEY STUMBLED UPON HIKING ALONG 
THE BEACH IN BIG SUR ON FRIDAY. 
>> WE HAD NO IDEA SOMEONE WAS 
MISSING. 
>> Reporter: IN A FACEBOOK 
POST, ANGELA HERNANDEZ SAYS 
SEVEN DAYS EARLIER, SHE SWERVED 
TO AVOID HITTING AN ANIMAL AND 
PLUNGED TO THE BOTTOM OF A 
ROCKY 250 FOOT CLIFF. 
THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER AFTER 
THAT WAS WAKING UP. I COULD 
FEEL WATER RISING OVER MY 
KNEES. 
I WAS ABLE TO BREAK OUT OF MY 
CAR AND JUMP INTO THE OCEAN. 
I SWAM TO SHORE AND FELL 
ASLEEP. 
SHE SAYS THE NEXT FEW DAYS WERE 
A BLUR. 
SHE WANTED THE BEACH YELLING IN 
VAIN FOR HELP. 
SHE FOUND A 10 INCH HOSE IN HER 
CAR WRECKAGE. 
>> SHE WOULD LAY UNDER THE 
ROCKS AND LET WATER DRIP OFF OF 
THE ROCKS ONTO THE HOSE. 
WE TURNED AROUND AND SHE WAS 
RIGHT THERE ON THE ROCKS. 
IT JUST LOOKED LIKE HELL. 
>> Reporter: SHE WROTE, WHEN I 
SET UP, I SAW A WOMAN WALKING 
ACROSS THE SHORE. 
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A DREAM. 
PHOTOS CAPTURED RESCUERS 
ATTENDING TO HER AND HOISTING 
HER TO SAFETY. 
DOCTORS TOLD HER SHE HAD A 
BRAIN HEMORRHAGE. 
THE CRASH HAD ALSO CAUSED ME TO 
FRACTURE FOUR RIBS AND BREAKING 
FRACTURE BOTH COLLARBONES AND 
HAVE LUNG COLLAPSE. 
OVER THE WEEKEND, SHE 
RECONNECTED WITH CHELSEA ON 
INSTAGRAM. 
I WILL BE THANKFUL FOR YOU AND 
YOUR HUSBAND EVERY DAY FOR THE 
REST OF MY LIFE. 
>> NO ONE COULD SURVIVE THAT. 
WE LOOKED DOWN AT THE CLIFF, 
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE SURVIVE 
THAT, BUT ANGELA DID. 
>> THAT IS AN AMAZING STORY. 
>> UNBELIEVABLE. 
>> WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF 
STORIES LIKE THAT OF THE HUMAN 
WILL, THE HUMAN CONDITION 
TRIUMPHING OVER REALLY ADVERSE 
CONDITION. 
THE BOYS IN THAILAND, AND NOW 
THIS. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, 
BUT AMAZON PRIME DAY IS JUST 
HOURS AWAY. 
WE WILL TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE 
THE MOST OF IT. 
>>> LEADING UP TO TODAY'S 
MEETING, CRITICS NOTICED THE 
INEXPERIENCE OF TRUMP COMPARED 
TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
>> WE HAVE MORE ON THE LONG AND 
CONTROVERSIAL CAREER OF 
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
>> LAST NIGHT AT THE WORLD CUP 
CELEBRATION IN POURING RAIN, 
GUESS WHO WAS THE ONLY ONE TO 
STAY DRY. 
HE IS OFTEN CALLED A MODERN DAY 
CZAR. 
HE WALKS AND TALKS LIKE A MAN 
IN ABSOLUTE CONTROL. 
BUT WHAT MAKES HIM TICK? 
HE WAS TRAINED AS A KGB AGENT 
DURING THE COLD WAR, AND IT IS 
IN HIS DNA TO VIEW THE UNITED 
STATES AS AN ADVERSARY. 
HE IS AN OLD-FASHIONED HE-MAN, 
THE VERY OPPOSITE OF 
POLITICALLY CORRECT WHOSE 
NEGOTIATING TACTICS INCLUDE 
MIND GAMES. 
HE ONCE TOOK HIS DOG TO A 
MEETING WITH THE GERMAN LEADER 
ANGELA MERKEL WHO WAS AFRAID OF 
THEM AND HE KEPT PRESIDENT 
OBAMA WAITING FOR 40 MINUTES. 
HE IS ALSO A POPULIST WHO CAN 
TURN ON THE CHARM ESPECIALLY 
DURING HIS REGULAR EPIC ASK THE 
PRESIDENT CALL IN SHOWS. 
HE LOVES WEALTH AND THE 
TRAPPINGS OF POWER AT ALMOST ANY
COST. 
HE BRAZENLY STOOD CENTERSTAGE 
AT THE LIMITS WHILE RUSSIAN 
ATHLETES WERE DOPING ON AN 
INDUSTRIAL SCALE. 
FUNDAMENTALLY, HE RESPECTS 
STRENGTH, BOTH MILITARY AND 
POLITICAL. 
THE MAN PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
SITTING DOWN WITH ALSO HAS A 
BLACK BELT IN JUDO. 
OPPONENTS SAY HE IS NIMBLE AND 
RUTHLESS. 
>> HE IS GOING TO LOOK FOR 
SUBTLE SIGNALS AND 
VULNERABILITIES THAT HE CAN 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IN THE 
MEETING. 
AND A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING IS THE 
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO DO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
>> HE ONCE SAID THAT THE 
COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION 
WAS THE GREATEST CATASTROPHE OF 
THE 20th CENTURY. 
EVERYTHING HE SAYS AND DOES IS 
ABOUT REVERSING THAT COLLAPSE. 
IN SHORT, TAKING RUSSIA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
>> FASCINATING INSIGHT FROM 
ELIZABETH PALMER ON VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
>>> NOW TO NICARAGUA WHERE 
DEADLY VIOLENCE IS ESCORTED. 
AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
BETWEEN AUNTIE GOVERNOR -- 
ANTIGOVERNMENT PROTESTERS OF 
THE WEEKEND. 
SEVERAL STUDENTS WERE KILLED IN 
A WAVE OF UNREST AT UNIVERSITY 
CAMPUS, AND SEVERAL OTHERS DIED 
AFTER POLICE AND PRO-GOVERNMENT 
FORCES ATTACKED KEY OPPOSITION 
STRONGHOLDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
>> HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED SINCE PROTESTS FIRST 
STARTED IN APRIL. 
OVER THE WEEKEND, PROTESTERS 
AND JOURNALISTS WERE TRAPPED 
INSIDE A CHURCH WHERE SEVERAL 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND ANOTHER 
ROUND OF BLOODSHED. 
>>> WE HAVE A LOT MORE NEWS 
AHEAD. 
>>> THERE WILL BE MILLIONS OF 
ITEMS ON SALE DURING AMAZON 
PRIME DAY. 
IT STARTS TODAY AT 3 PM EASTERN 
AND RUNS FOR 36 HOURS. 
>> DAN ACKERMAN IS A SENIOR 
EDITOR. HE IS HERE TO TALK 
ABOUT THE MOST NOTABLE BARGAINS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY NOTABLE 
ONES. 
 
>> IT IS MORE HYPE AND MAYBE 
LESS PAYOFF. 
BUT YOU STILL GO EVERY YEAR. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. 
I AM A PRIMA MEMBER. 
-- I AM A PRIME MEMBER. 
EVERY YEAR THEY SAY PRIME DAY 
IS THE DAY THEY SIGN UP AT THE 
MOST PRIME MEMBERS OF THE YEAR. 
THE PRICE KEEPS GOING UP. 
$79. 
$99. 
$190. 
THEY HAVE TO ADD MORE STUFF TO 
GET YOU TO SIGN ON AND STAY 
SIGNED ON. 
>> I HAVE AN ITEM IN MIND THAT 
I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS FOR. 
I'M THING THAT ONE OF THOSE 
DOORBELLS WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE 
NEIGHBORS.  GIVE ME 
AN IDEA OF A CATEGORY DOES 
>> THEY KEEP A LOT OF IT SECRET 
UNTIL 3 PM. THEY WANT YOU TO GO 
AND SEARCH THROUGH EVERY THING. 
THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU ON THE 
SITE. 
THEY TEASED SOME EARLY DEALS ON 
THEIR iPHONE AND ANDROID APP. 
I WENT AND LOOKED AND THEY HAD 
THE DOORBELL ON THEM. 
I THINK IT'S USUALLY $250, BUT 
NOW IT'S $175. 
THAT IS AN EARLY DEAL ON SALE 
RIGHT NOW. 
YOU PICK THE RIGHT THING. 
>> IS IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO 
WAIT FOR PRIME DAY OR MORE 
ADVANTAGEOUS TO WAIT FOR BLACK 
FRIDAY? 
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU ARE 
LOOKING FOR, I BOUGHT A BIG 
FANCY TV, I KNEW NOT TO WAIT 
FOR PRIME DAY, BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T USUALLY HAVE A REALLY 
HIGH-END TV. 
THEY WILL HAVE SOME 
TELEVISIONS, BUT NOT THE HIGH-
END ONES. 
THEY HAD A TOSHIBA 50 INCH, 4K, 
$289, THAT'S NOT BAD, BUT IT'S 
NOT LIKE A HIGH-END TV. 
AND THE ECHO.
IS, THEY GET YOU TO PUT ONE 
INTO EVERY ROOM. 
>> THE -- AND THEY ARE NOT THE 
ONLY ONES, OTHER RETAILERS ARE 
HIP TO THE CONCEPT. 
>> THE FIRST DAY, THEY HAD 
OTHER COUNTER PRIME DAY SALES. 
THE LAST 2 YEARS IT DIDN'T DO 
THAT AS MUCH, BUT THIS YEAR 
THEY ARE BACK AGAIN. 
TARGET IS HAVING A SALE, BEST 
BUY IS HAVING A BIG SALE, 
OTHERS ARE HAVING A BIG SALE. 
PEOPLE HAVE ONLINE SHOPPING ON 
THE BRAIN TODAY, SO THEY MIGHT 
AS WILL BE OUT THERE TRYING TO 
COMPETE. 
>> I AM LOOKING AT THIS FOR 
THIS TOSHIBA TELEVISION. 
 
>> YOU DIDN'T EVEN WAIT FOR THE 
INTERVIEW. 
 
>> MY NEPHEWS CAME OVER AND 
THEY ARE 8 YEARS OLD AND 12 
YEARS OLD, AND I HAVE A 40 PLUS 
INCH. 
MY NEPHEWS COME IN AND THEY GO, 
HE GOES TO HIS DAD, WHY DOES HE 
HAVE SUCH A SMALL TELEVISION? 
 IT WAS SO 
EMBARRASSING TO BE GET DISSED 
BY THE KIDS. 
 
>> THAT ONE IS ON SALE NOW. 
>> ANYTHING YOU SHOULDN'T BUY? 
>> I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE 
LOOKING TO GET SOMETHING SUPER 
HIGH-END, WHETHER IT IS A TV OR 
A GAME CONSOLE, YOU WON'T FIND 
THAT. 
IF YOU DO FIND AN ELECTRONIC 
THING, DO THE PRICE COMPARISON. 
FRANKLY, SOME OF THE DISCOUNTS 
ARE NOT THAT DEEP. 
>> IS BEST BUY OR SOME OF THESE 
OTHER TECH SELLERS, CAN THEY 
COMPETE WITH STUFF LIKE THIS? 
>> IT IS TOUGH. 
THEY CAN TAKE A LOSS ON 
SOMETHING AND GIVE YOU 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE A 
BLACK FRIDAY DOOR BUSTER. 
BUT IT'S THE EASY SHIPPING AND 
RETURNS AND CUSTOMER 
RELATIONSHIPS. 
>> THAT IS WHY, EVEN IF YOU ARE 
A PRIME MEMBER LIKE I AM, WHEN 
YOU LOOK AROUND, SOMETIMES YOU 
AREN'T GETTING IT ANY CHEAPER, 
BUT IT'S MORE CONVENIENT. 
>> ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU. 
>>> COMING UP, WE WILL HAVE ALL 
OF THE DETAILS ON PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN'S FACE-
TO-FACE MEETING. 
WHAT ISSUES ARE ON THE TABLE 
AND IF THE PRESIDENT WAS WISE 
TO GO INTO THE MEETING WITH 
WHAT HE SAID WERE LOW 
EXPECTATIONS. 
>>> AND A VIOLENT PROTEST IN 
CHICAGO AFTER AN OFFICER SHOT 
AND KILLED AN ARMED BLACK MAN. 
WHY POLICE SAY THEY RELEASED THE
BODY CAN VIDEO TO SHOW PEOPLE 
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. 
>>> AND HOW TWO HIKERS SAVED A 
WOMAN'S LIFE AFTER SHE PLUNGED 
250 FEET OFF A CLIFF AND WAS 
STRANDED ALONE FOR A WEEK. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN,  CBS 
NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>> HI, EVERYONE, I'M ANNE-
MARIE GREEN. 
>> AND I'M VLADIMIR DUTHIERS. 
THANKS FOR JOINING US. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN MET 
FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OF HIGH 
STAKES TALKS BEHIND DOORS IN 
HELSINKI, FINLAND. 
HE SAID EARLIER THE WORLD WANTS 
TO SEE THE U.S. AND RUSSIA GET 
ALONG AND CALLED THE TWO 
NATIONS THE WORLD'S TWO GREAT 
NUCLEAR POWERS. 
>> THEY'RE MEETING COMES DAYS 
AFTER THE U.S. JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT CHARGED 12 RUSSIAN 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS FOR 
HACKING INTO THE DEMOCRATIC 
NATIONAL COMMITTEE DURING THE 
2016 ELECTION. 
HERE'S SOME OF WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY EARLIER. 
>> MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE A 
LOT OF GOOD THINGS TO TALK 
ABOUT AND THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. 
WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON 
EVERYTHING FROM TRADE TO 
MILITARY TO MISSILES TO NUCLEAR 
TO CHINA, WE'LL BE TALKING A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT CHINA. 
A MUTUAL FRIEND, PRESIDENT XI. 
I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 
OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER AS TWO 
COUNTRIES THAT FRANKLY, WE HAVE 
NOT BEEN GETTING ALONG VERY 
WELL FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF 
YEARS. 
I HAVE BEEN HERE NOT TOO LONG, 
BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO TWO 
YEARS, BUT I THINK WE WILL END 
UP HAVING AN EXTRAORDINARY 
RELATIONSHIP. 
I HOPE SO. 
I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT, AND I'M 
SURE YOU'VE HEARD OVER THE 
YEARS AND AS I CAMPAIGNED THAT 
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A 
GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. 
AND I REALLY THINK THE WORLD 
WANTS TO SEE US GETTING ALONG. 
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 
POWERS. 
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR AND 
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING. 
IT'S A BAD THING, AND I THINK 
WE HOPEFULLY CAN DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A 
POSITIVE FORCE. 
IT'S A NEGATIVE FORCE. 
SO WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT 
AMONG OTHER THINGS. 
>> LET'S TURN TO CBS NEWS CHIEF 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MAJOR 
GARRETT, HE JOINS US NOW FROM 
HELSINKI. 
MAJOR, PUT THIS MEETING IN 
CONTEXT FOR US. 
WHAT IS AT STAKE? 
AND I THINK IT'S HARD TO FIGURE 
OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S AT STAKE 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON 
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA, REALLY. 
>> Reporter: RIGHT, WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE TWO 
MEETINGS, FIRST THE ONE ON ONE 
MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN, THEN THE 
EXTENDED MEETING WHERE RUSSIAN 
ADVISERS, AND AMERICANS WILL BE 
IN THE ROOM TO HASH OUT WHAT 
WAS SAID IN THE PRIVATE 
MEETING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WHATEVER 
REASON HAS BEEN COMPLETELY 
VAGUE ABOUT HIS OWN INTENTIONS 
GOING INTO THIS SUMMIT. 
WHAT ISSUES DOES HE CARE TO 
DRIVE WITH THE RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT, WHAT INTERESTS OF 
THE UNITED STATES IS HE GOING 
TO BRING TO BEAR UP AGAINST THE 
RUSSIAN LEADER AND WHAT IS HE 
GOING TO TRY TO EXTRACT IN 
TERMS OF CONCESSIONS FROM THE 
RUSSIANS. 
OR TO GET THEM SIMPLY TO LIVE 
UP TO AGREEMENTS THEY HAVE 
ALREADY MADE WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT IN PLACES, FOR 
EXAMPLE, LIKE SYRIA. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS OUT OF THIS 
MEETING. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS UNTIL 
YESTERDAY WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
DECLARED THIS A SUMMIT ON 
TWITTER, ALL OF HIS SENIOR 
ADVISERS, PUBLICLY AND 
PRIVATELY WERE SAYING TO 
REPORTERS LIKE ME, DON'T YOU 
DARE CALL THIS A SUMMIT. 
IT'S A MEETING. 
A SUMMIT HAS TOO BIG OF AN 
AGENDA, SETS TOO HIGH OF 
EXPECTATIONS, THEN WHAT DOES 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALL IT ON 
TWITTER, HE CALLS IT A SUMMIT. 
THAT SUGGESTS A COUPLE OF 
THINGS, ONE, A DECOUPLING FROM 
HIS OWN ADVISERS ABOUT HOW TO 
SET EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS 
ENCOUNTER, AND TWO, IT SUGGESTS 
THAT EVEN WHEN THOSE CLOSEST TO 
THE PRESIDENT ARE TRYING TO 
HELP HIM BY MAINTAINING A LOWER 
LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS, THE 
PRESIDENT EITHER DOESN'T TAKE 
THAT HELP SERIOUSLY OR DEFIES 
IT FOR HIS OWN REASON AND I CAN 
TELL YOU WHEN I WAS IN BRUSSELS 
TALKING TO NATO MINISTERS AND 
TALKING TO THOSE IN THE UNITED 
STATES IN PREPARATION FOR 
COVERING THIS SUMMIT, EACH AND 
EVERY MOMENT IN THIS EXTENDED 
PERIOD OF TIME THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SPENDS ONE ON ONE WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN RAISES THE LEVEL 
OF ANXIETY, AND EUROPEAN 
CAPITALS AND BACK HOME. 
WHY? 
BECAUSE IN THIS STATE CRAFT, 
PUTIN IS A MUCH MORE 
EXPERIENCED NEGOTIATOR, KNOWS 
WHAT HIS AGENDA IS, DRIVES HIS 
BARGAIN HIS WAY, CAPABLE OF 
FLATTERING NOT JUST THIS 
PRESIDENT BUT OTHER AMERICAN 
PRESIDENTS AND GETTING HIS WAY 
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. 
SO THAT'S A CONSTRUCT THAT 
CREATES SOME DEGREE OF ANXIETY 
AMONG AMERICAN ALLIES. 
WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN IN 
THIS PRIVATE ENCOUNTER AND WHAT 
WILL VLADIMIR PUTIN SAY ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF IT IN TERMS OF 
ISSUES HE'S TRIED TO DRIVE WITH 
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT. 
BY ENTERING WITH A VAGUE 
AGENDA, IT CREATES AN OPENING, 
AT LEAST AN OPENING FOR PUTIN 
TO GET MORE OF WHAT HE WANTS 
BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE DEFINED IT 
UP FRONT. 
>> AND MAJOR, WHAT IS THE WHITE 
HOUSE SAYING ABOUT THAT VAGUE 
AGENDA WHEN FOR A LOT OF 
AMERICANS, A LOT OF MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, THERE COULD BE A 
COUPLE OF SPECIFIC THINGS THE 
PRESIDENT COULD SAY HE WANTS TO 
TALK ABOUT. 
HE COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 
ABOUT CRIMEA. 
HE COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 
ABOUT THE POISONING OF UK 
CITIZENS ON THEIR SOIL. 
HE CAN SAY THAT HE WANTS TO 
TALK ABOUT THOSE 12 RUSSIAN 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS THAT 
WERE JUST INDICTED BY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, BUT YET 
HE LEFT IT TO WE'RE GOING TO 
TALK ABOUT CHINA, WE WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR, WE WANT TO 
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE 
RESPONDING TO THAT LINE OF 
THINKING FROM OTHER AMERICANS? 
>> Reporter: THAT THE PRESIDENT 
SETS THE AGENDA, AND THAT'S IT, 
AND HE'S THE DEAL MAKER AND 
HE'S THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, AND 
WHAT HE SAYS GOES, THAT GOES 
BACK TO THIS DECOUPLING I 
TALKED ABOUT, WHETHER TO 
DESCRIBE THIS AS A SUMMIT OR A 
MEETING, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ON 
BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT WERE 
WORKING OVERTIME TO SAY IT'S A 
MEETING, LOWER EXPECTATIONS, 
THE PRESIDENT CALLS IT A 
SUMMIT. 
THAT MEANS HE'S RUNNING THE 
SHOW. 
HE'S AT THE TOP AND HE DEFINES 
HIS OWN REALITY AND DEFINES 
WHATEVER THE CONTOURS OF WHAT 
HE WANTS TO NEGOTIATE IN THE 
MOMENT AT THAT TIME. 
THEN HE LEAVES IT TO HIS 
ADVISERS TO SORT OUT AND COPE 
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES, LET'S 
REMIND OURSELVES HOW THAT 
PLAYED OUT IN SINGAPORE WITH 
THE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN. 
NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION 
EXPECTED THE PRESIDENT TO AT 
THAT MEETING GIVE UP JOINT 
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH THE 
SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT, YET 
THE PRESIDENT DID, AND WHEN HE 
ANNOUNCED IT, IT SURPRISED THE 
SOUTH KOREANS, THE PENTAGON, 
OUR JAPANESE ALLIES. 
THE PRESIDENT MADE A DEAL IN 
THE MOMENT, FACE-TO-FACE, AND 
EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO ADAPT TO 
IT AFTERWARDS AND IN SO 
ANNOUNCING THE END OF JOINT 
MILITARY EXERCISES, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP USED THE VERY LANGUAGE 
THE NORTH KOREAN LANGUAGE HAD 
ALREADY USED, THEY WERE 
PROVOCATIVE, SO THAT'S AN 
EXAMPLE, A CLASSIC, THEREFORE, 
EVERYONE TO SEE EXAMPLE OF WHAT 
CAN HAPPEN IN THESE ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETINGS WHERE THE PRESIDENT 
WALKS IN, THOSE AROUND HIM 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS AGENDA IS, 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE AGREES TO, 
AGREES TO IT, AND TURNS AROUND 
TO EVERYONE ELSE AND SAYS MAKE 
IT WORK. 
WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING 
TO SAY TO HIS ADVISERS AFTER 
HIS LENGTHY MEETING WITH PUTIN 
AND SAY THAT'S WHAT I HAVE 
AGREED TO, MAKE IT WORK. 
TO YOUR POINT, HE HAS GIVEN NO 
INDICATION THAT HE IS 
PASSIONATELY OR INTELLECTUALLY 
OR POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TO 
DRIVING THIS ISSUE OF RUSSIAN 
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION HARD, 
PAST OR PRESENT, AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN 
SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS ABOUT WHAT 
TO SAY ABOUT RUSSIANS IN 
CRIMEA. 
THEY HAVEN'T SAID THEY WILL 
RECOGNIZE IT OFFICIALLY BUT 
THEY HAVEN'T RULED IT OUT. 
THAT'S AN OPENING FOR THE 
RUSSIANS, AND I CAN TELL YOU IN 
BRUSSELS, ANOTHER BIG TOPIC, 
IT'S NOT A HUGE ISSUE BUT IT'S 
ONE THAT'S CENTRAL TO THE 
FUTURE OF THE NATO ALLIANCE, 
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES IN THE 
BALTICS, NATO WANTS THEM TO 
CONTINUE AS A SIGNAL TO MOSCOW, 
DON'T MESS AROUND IN THE 
BALTICS, YOU HAVE TO KEEP AN 
EYE ON THAT AS WELL. 
>> YOU BROUGHT UP THE RUSSIAN 
MING AND OF COURSE THIS IS 
COMING AFTER WE FOUND OUT ON 
FRIDAY, 12 RUSSIAN OFFICERS. 
I THINK MY QUESTION TO YOU 
MAJOR IS, YOU KNOW, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT HE 
MIGHT BRING IT UP, NOT REALLY 
SORT OF TOP OF HIS AGENDA, BUT 
WHAT CAN HE REALLY SAY. 
WHAT ARE HIS OPTIONS, YOU KNOW, 
PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY TOLD 
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO CUT IT OUT, 
DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A 
DIFFERENCE. 
>> Reporter: WHEN IT COMES TO 
OPTIONS, YOU CAN USE THE VOICE 
OF AMERICA, THE PRESIDENCY OF 
THE UNITED STATES, AND AS THE 
ESSENTIALLY REPOSITORY AT THE 
TOP OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY 
TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, WE IN 
AMERICA CARE ABOUT OUR 
DEMOCRACY, AND WE'RE GOING TO 
PROTECT IT, AND YOU INVADED IT 
IN A HOSTILE ACT. 
WE KNOW IT, THE INDICTMENTS ARE 
REAL, THE FACTS ARE THERE. 
THIS HAPPENED AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS OF YOUR GOVERNMENT. 
WE KNOW IT, YOU SHOULD KNOW 
THAT WE KNOW IT, AND WE WILL 
TAKE EVERY SINGLE STEP WE CAN 
TO STOP IT IN THE FUTURE. 
NOW THAT'S NOT A CONTROVERSIAL 
THING TO SAY. 
IT'S A DIRECT FORCEFUL RESPONSE 
TO A HOSTILE ACT BY A HOSTILE 
GOVERNMENT. 
MANY IN CONGRESS HAVE ASKED FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO SAY PRECISELY 
THOSE WORDS AND SAY THEM IN 
PUBLIC AND REINFORCE THEM IN 
PRIVATE, AND ONE OF THE THINGS 
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO, 
WHICH IS SLOW TO HAVE DONE 
UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
IS FOUR TO FIVE CYBER DEFENSES, 
GATHER ALL THE STATES OF 
VARIOUS ELECTION OFFICES, 
SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE 
LIKE, AND HELP THEM FORTIFY 
THEIR DEFENSES AND MAKE IT A 
PROJECT TO MONITOR AND 
INTERCEPT AND CALL OUT PUBLICLY 
ANY FUTURE EFFORTS BY THE 
RUSSIANS. 
ALL OF THOSE ARE OPTIONS 
AVAILABLE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
AND MANY IN CONGRESS IN BOTH 
PARTIES ARE AT LEAST HOPEFUL HE 
WILL MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. 
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT MAJORS 
DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL AND 
FOCUS BECAUSE WE CAN HEAR 
THERE'S ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT 
VERY CLOSE TO YOU TALKING VERY 
LOUD, AND YOU STAYED FOCUSED ON 
US. 
>> YEAH, WE APPRECIATE THAT AS 
ALWAYS, MAJOR, AND MAJOR, WE 
SHOULD POINT OUT FOR OUR 
AUDIENCE WITH WITH REGARDS TO 
HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TREATING 
THIS MEETING AND TREATING THE 
RUSSIANS, HE TWEETED EARLIER 
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA 
HAS NEVER BEEN WORSE THANKS TO 
MANY YEARS OF U.S. FOOLISH 
STUPIDITY, AND NOW THE RUSSIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTRY OF AFFAIRS 
THROUGH THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT 
RESPONDED WE AGREE. 
SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> THAT'S REMARKABLE. 
IT'S JUST REMARKABLE TO THINK 
OF THAT, AND THAT IS PART OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SENSE OF 
HIMSELF, AND SENSE OF HIS 
PRESIDENCY AS BEING SO 
DIFFERENT THAN ANY PRESIDENCY 
THAT CAME BEFORE IT. 
ON THIS AND SO MANY OTHER 
ISSUES. 
IT'S AS IF THE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENCY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE 
HE ARRIVED THERE, OR IF IT DID, 
IT WAS SO MISDIRECTED AND SO 
FOOLISH, SO STUPID, THAT IT'S 
THE CAUSE OF ALL CURRENT 
PROBLEMS HE'S TRYING TO SORT 
OUT. 
NOTHING COULD PLEASE THE 
RUSSIANS MORE THAN TO HAVE THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
AS HE WALKS INTO A PRIVATE 
MEETING WITH PUTIN, ESSENTIALLY 
EMBRACE THEIR INTERPRETATION. 
HEY, IT'S NOT US. 
IT'S NOT US INVADING UKRAINE 
AND TAKING OVER CRIMEA, IT'S 
NOT US BREAKING AGREEMENTS WE 
HAVE MADE WITH YOU IN SYRIA. 
IT'S NOT US MEDDLING IN YOUR 
ELECTIONS, PAST AND POSSIBLY 
PRESENT. 
IT'S NOT US, AS YOU MENTIONED, 
VLAD, POISONING A BRITISH 
CITIZEN IN BRITAIN. 
NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAVE 
HARMED THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP. 
IT'S THOSE PAST AMERICAN 
PRESIDENTS. 
FOR THAT, VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD 
ALMOST, I THINK, WANT TO EXTEND 
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP A 
METAPHORICAL AND LITERAL 
BOUQUET OF THANKS, BECAUSE IT 
COULDN'T SET A BETTER PREDICATE 
FOR THEIR CONVERSATION. 
IT'S MORE THAN HALFWAY TO WHAT 
THE RUSSIANS ALREADY BELIEVE 
ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THIS 
RELATIONSHIP. 
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING. 
>> MAJOR GARRETT IN HELSINKI 
FOR US, MAJOR, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
>> YOU GOT IT. 
>>> ALEX CLEMENTE US, WRITE 
FORKER SIGNAL, ALEX, THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF PRESIDENT PUTIN 
FORMALLY SITTING DOWN WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WAKE OF 
ALL THAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA, 
AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES TWEETED THAT THE 
TENSIONS AND THE CHALLENGES AND 
THE PROBLEMS, THE DIFFICULTIES 
THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND RUSSIA ARE DUE TO 
U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND STUPIDITY. 
SOMETHING THAT THE RUSSIAN 
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
AGREED WITH. 
>> WELL, LOOK, I THINK THE FACT 
THAT THEY'RE SITTING DOWN IS ON 
ITS FACE A WIN FOR PUTIN, 
RIGHT. 
IN A NUMBER OF RESPECTS. 
ONE, IT GIVES PUTIN THE ABILITY 
TO SAY WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
ALL THESE THINGS, AND THE U.S. 
PRESIDENT IS NOT ONLY WILLING 
TO SIT DOWN WITH US BUT ALSO TO 
ACCEPT THE RUSSIAN NARRATIVE 
THAT THE DETERIORATION IN 
RELATIONS, WHICH IS AN 
OBSERVABLE DETERIORATION IN 
NATIONS IS IN FACT THE U.S.' 
FAULT AND NOT RUSSIA'S FAULT. 
TRUMP HAS SAID REPEATEDLY 
HAVING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP IS A 
GOOD IDEA, HAVING A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP IS A GOAL OF HIS. 
HE'S RIGHT, HAVING A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP IS IN PRINCIPLE A 
GOOD THING. 
WHAT IS NOT IN THE 
CONVERSATION, IT IS A TOOL 
EFFECT OTHER OUTCOMES THAT YOU 
WANT, AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY 
CLEAR WHAT TRUMP IS GOING INTO 
THE MEETING POTENTIALLY SEEKING 
FROM PUTIN. 
WE'RE AWARE OF WHAT PUTIN IS 
SEEKING FROM TRUMP, THE GREEN 
LIGHT, THE LETBY GONES BE. 
>> IS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP EVEN 
REALISTIC WHEN WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN? 
>> IT'S INTERESTING, ON ONE 
LEVEL THERE ARE CERTAIN 
DIVERGENCES BETWEEN WHAT RUSSIA 
WANTS AND WHAT THE U.S. WANTS. 
RUSSIA WANTS TO BE TREATED AS A 
GREAT POWER IN A WORLD IN WHICH 
ITS ACTUAL ECONOMIC AND 
MILITARY POWER IS NOT REALLY UP 
TO SNUFF. 
RUSSIA WANTS TO SEE A WORLD IN 
WHICH U.S. MORAL LEADERSHIP AND 
MULTILATERAL LEADERSHIP WHERE 
THERE'S A WAY. 
TRADITIONALLY THE U.S. HAS NOT 
WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN. 
NOW YOU HAVE TWO LEADERS, PUTIN 
AND TRUMP WHO HAVE A SIMILAR 
WORLD VIEW, NEITHER OF THEM 
SEES A PARTICULAR VALUE IN 
NATO. 
BOTH VIEW. 
EU AS A CHALLENGE, RATHER THAN 
AN OPPORTUNITY. 
AND NEITHER OF THEM WISHES TO 
SEE THE U.S. AS KIND OF 
EXERTING MORAL LEADERSHIP OVER 
A MULTILATERAL STRUCTURE. 
BOTH COME FROM DIFFERENT ORIGIN 
POINTS BUT THE FACT IS THEY 
HAPPEN TO OVERLAP. 
THAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. SIDE OF 
THE RELATIONSHIP. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS IN MANY 
INTERVIEWS SUGGESTED THAT MUCH 
OF THESE PROBLEMS, IF WE'RE TO 
PARSE WHAT HE PUT ON TWITTER 
ABOUT U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND 
STUPIDITY, IT MIGHT BE SUGGESTS 
OBAMA. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE DONE 
DIFFERENTLY. 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO INDICATE 
THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS THE 
GOAL IN AND OF ITSELF AS YOU 
SAID, WHEN YOU DISREGARD ALL 
THE THINGS THAT RUSSIA HAS 
DONE, I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T EVEN 
TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
RUSSIA SHOT DOWN A CIVILIAN 
AIRLINER WITH 300 SOULS ON 
BOARD OVER UKRAINE, MALAYSIAN 
AIRLINES 17. 
>> OR THEY SUPPLIED THE MISSILE 
THAT WAS USED TO SHOOT THAT 
AIRCRAFT DOWN. 
>> THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE 
POISONED IN BRITAIN, THERE IS 
THIS ANNEXATION. 
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS WE CAN 
TALK ABOUT. 
IS IT ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE THIS 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
IS THAT ENOUGH SO THAT PUTIN 
SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO DO THOSE 
THINGS AGAIN? 
>> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN, IF THESE 
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED, AND HE 
STILL GETS TO ENJOY A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. 
>> THEN IT'S A WIN FOR HIM. 
>> RIGHT. 
YEAH. 
>> IT'S HARD FOR BY GONES TO BE 
BY GONES, THEY'RE IN 
POSSESSIONOVER CRIMEA. 
THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO MEDDLE 
IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS 
THESE ARE BOTH REVISIONIST 
LEADERS IN THEIR OWN WAY. 
PUTIN WANTS TO REVISE THE POST 
COLD WAR ORDER IN WHICH RUSSIA 
WAS WEAK AND HUMILIATED AND NO 
ONE PAID ATTENTION TO RUSSIA. 
HIS BEEF IS WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT, IF 
YOU WILL, AND TRUMP'S BIG BEEF 
IS WITH THE AMERICAN POLITICAL 
ESTABLISHMENT. 
RIGHT, SO THEY BOTH COME AT IT 
FROM THIS KIND OF OUTSIDER, 
SORT OF ISOLATED REVISIONIST 
PERSPECTIVE, AND I THINK THEY 
HAVE SOME KIND OF COMMON GROUND 
ON THAT. 
BUT AS YOU SAY, LOOK, I MEAN, 
IF THE U.S. PRESIDENT IS GOING 
TO HOLD RUSSIA TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THESE THINGS, THERE HAS TO BE A 
CLEAR MESSAGE, RIGHT? 
I MEAN, PUTIN GOES INTO THIS 
AND IF THERE'S NO PUSH BACK 
FROM TRUMP, IF HE DOESN'T SAY, 
HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T 
HAVE BEEN DOING THESE THINGS, 
AND NOT ONLY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE 
DOING THESE THINGS, BUT HERE 
ARE THE COSTS IT YOU TRY TO DO 
IT AGAIN, YOU DON'T SEE THE 
MESSAGE COMING FROM TRUMP. 
>> TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE 
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, WHAT 
WOULD A WIN LOOK LIKE FOR THE 
UNITED STATES IF WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT WINS THE WAY THE 
PRESIDENT LIKES TO TALK ABOUT 
THEM, SOMEBODY WINS, SOMEBODY 
LOSES, WHAT WOULD A WIN LOOK 
LIKE, THE SUMMIT IS OVER. 
>> FOR THE UNITED STATES OR 
TRUMP HIMSELF, I THINK THOSE 
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. 
>> GIVE ME BOTH. 
>> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN, FROM 
TRUMP'S PERSPECTIVE HE CAN COME 
OUT OF IT SAYING, LOOK, I BROKE 
THE TABOOS, I ALONE WAS ABLE TO 
MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH. 
THIS IS THE THIRD PRESIDENT 
THAT HAS TRIED TO RESET 
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 
WE'LL SEE IF TRUMP IS MORE 
SUCCESSFUL THAN TWO 
PREDECESSORS, A REAL WIN FROM 
THE U.S. KIND OF BROADER 
NATIONAL INTEREST PERSPECTIVE, 
I THINK THERE'S RELATIVELY 
LITTLE SCOPE FOR THAT. 
IF YOU GOT PROGRESS ON SAY A 
NEW ARMS CONTROL, RIGHT, THERE 
ARE TWO TREATIES THAT ARE 
CURRENTLY PROBLEMS WITH THE 
TREATIES, ONE IS THE START 
TREATY WHICH NEEDS TO BE 
RENEWED IN 2021. 
ANOTHER IS AN INTERMEDIATE 
FORCES TREATY THAT THE RUSSIANS 
HAVE BEEN VIOLATED FOR SEVERAL 
YEARS. 
IF YOU CAN GET PROGRESS, THAT 
WOULD BE A WIN. 
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET PUTIN 
TO SAY HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT 
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTIONS AND 
I'M WILLING TO COME CLEAN ABOUT 
IT. 
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET PUTIN 
TO FOLD ON UKRAINE AND SAY YOU 
CAN HAVE IT, IF NATO AND THE EU 
WANT TO MAKE A MEMBER, GO 
AHEAD. 
I THINK THE ACTUAL SCOPE FOR 
THE U.S. TO HAVE A BIG WIN OUT 
OF THIS SUMMIT IS ACTUALLY 
PRETTY SMALL. 
>> MUCH ADIEU ABOUT NOTHING IF 
NOTHING CONCRETE IS LIKELY TO 
COME OUT OF THIS. 
>> WE GO BACK TO THE SYMBOLISM, 
WHO WINS MOST FROM THE 
SYMBOLISM. 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EXPECTED 
SERIOUS OR SUBSTANTIATIVE, 
LEAST OF ALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
HE TRIED TO SET LOW 
EXPECTATIONS, HE FRONT RAN THE 
IDEA THAT IF THE SUMMIT WAS A 
BUST, IT WOULD BE BECAUSE THE 
MEDIA WAS NEVER GIVING HIM A 
FAIR SHAKE. 
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT, THE 
SUBSTANCE WAS NEVER WHAT THIS 
WAS ABOUT. 
IT'S MAINLY ABOUT SYMBOLISM AND 
IT'S A WIN MORE FOR PUTIN THAN 
TRUMP. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING, THE FACT 
THAT WE ARE GRASPING AT WHAT A 
WIN POLITICALLY BEGS THE 
QUESTION, OTHER THAN THE 
SYMBOLISM SITTING DOWN WITH THE 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, WHICH IS A 
GOOD THING IF YOU CAN GET FACE 
TO FACE BEFORE THE RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT, I GUESS THAT'S A 
GOOD THING, THEN WHY HOLD IT 
NOW, WHY EVEN DO IT AT ALL, IF 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PRESS ON 
THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THE 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED 
STATES, TO OUR ALLIES AND OUR 
PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD WHEN 
YOU HAVE THE GERMAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER SUGGESTING THAT THEY 
CAN NO LONGER RELY ON THE WHITE 
HOUSE, WHY HOLD THIS MEETING 
NOW AT ALL? 
>> I JUST DON'T THINK THOSE ARE 
THE CALCULATIONS THAT GO 
THROUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HEAD. 
I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT 
CREATING AN AURA AND MYSTIQUE 
AROUND HIS PRESIDENCY, HIS 
ABILITY TO SIT DOWN WITH AND 
GET, YOU KNOW, GET A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUYS THAT 
NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING TO TALK 
TO. 
HE'S WILLING TO TALK TO TOUGH 
NASTY GUYS AND FORM A 
RELATIONSHIP AND BE ABLE TO 
DEAL WITH THEM IN A WAY THAT 
OTHERS COULDN'T. 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT 
FROM TRUMP'S PERSPECTIVE. 
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT A 
CALCULATED APPROACH TO 
ADVANCING NATIONAL INTEREST. 
>> AND IT'S INTERESTING, TOO, I 
THINK THAT FOREIGN POLICY PLAYS 
OUT ON THE WORLD STAGE, BUT IT 
DOESN'T ALWAYS MATTER THAT MUCH 
BACK HOME. 
I THINK ABOUT GEORGE H. W. BUSH 
WINNING THE FIRST GULF WAR AND 
LOSING THE ELECTION TO BILL 
CLINTON. 
I REMEMBER BEING IN COLLEGE AT 
THE TIME OR RIGHT OUT OF 
COLLEGE AND I REMEMBER THINKING 
TO MYSELF, THERE'S NO WAY BUSH 
LOSES TO THE GOVERNOROF 
ARKANSAS AND YET HE DID BECAUSE 
AMERICANS WERE VERY HAPPY WITH 
THE WIN, BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY 
TRANSLATOR ANY KIND OF 
SIGNIFICANT VICTORY BACK HOME 
DURING THE ELECTIONS AND I JUST 
SOMETIMES WONDER IF A LOT OF 
THIS STUFF, IT LOOKS GREAT ON 
TRUMP'S RESUME, BUT DOESN'T 
ACTUALLY CHANGE ANYTHING HERE. 
>> I AGREE WITH YOU. 
I DON'T THINK THESE FOREIGN 
POLICY THINGS HAVE MUCH OF AN 
EFFECT. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT TRUMP 
DOES ON TRADE OR IMMIGRATION, 
THAT'S A WIN FOR SURE. 
THIS IS MORE ABOUT HIS 
PERCEPTION OF HIMSELF AS THIS 
KIND OF REVISIONIST NEW KIND OF 
PRESIDENT WHO'S DOING THINGS 
THAT, YOU KNOW, BOLDLY GOING 
WHERE NO ONE ELSE WOULD GO 
BEFORE AND OFTEN WITH LESS 
PREPARATION THAN HE MIGHT HAVE. 
>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LIVE 
PICTURE WHERE WE EXPECT THE 
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE AND IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 
COMES OUT OF THAT. 
>> DO WE HAVE ANY DETAILS ABOUT 
THAT, IF THEY'RE TAKING 
QUESTIONS OR BRIEF STATEMENTS? 
>> LET'S ASK OUR CONTROL ROOM? 
GUYS ARE WE A HEARING THEY'RE 
GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS? 
>> HAVEN'T HEARD YET. 
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING. 
MY GUESS IS NOT. 
>> PROBABLY NOT. 
>> BUT THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO 
TALK. 
BOTH PRESIDENTS LIKE TO TALK. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHAT IS HE, 
IT'S A WEEKLY THING. 
>> IT'S A YEARLY THING WHERE HE 
DOES A CALL IN SHOW WITH THE 
ENTIRE, ALL OF RUSSIA. 
HE SITS THERE FOR 3, 4 HOURS, A 
MARATHON THING, PEOPLE CALL IN. 
>> HE ENJOYS IT. 
HE'S VERY GOOD AT IT. 
HE HAS A REAL, I COVERED RUSSIA 
IF MANY YEARS. 
HE HAS A REAL CHARISMA WITH 
PEOPLE. 
IT'S HIGHLY STAGED, EVERYTHING 
FROM A FARMER IN SIBERIA, HIS 
SEEDS WEREN'T DELIVERED ON 
TIME. 
TRUMP SAYS I WILL COME DELIVER 
THE SEEDS FOR YOU. 
>> PUTIN. 
>> INDICT ME, VLAD, INDICT ME. 
>> BOTH PRESIDENTS ARE VERY 
GOOD WITH THE MEDIA. 
>> THEY HAVE A LOT OF 
SIMILARITIES, RIGHT, WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER FROM 
THEIR MAKE OUR COUNTRY, RUSSIA 
OR AMERICA GREAT AGAIN TO THEIR 
SORT OF SENSE OF BEING 
OUTSIDERS AND RULE BREAKERS, 
SHAKING THINGS UP. 
AND EVEN SORT OF THE PROJECTION 
OF BEING STRONG MEN, 
INTENTIONALLY A STRONG MAN IN 
THE TRADITIONAL SENSE OF THE 
WAY FOR OUR PRESIDENT, BUT THEY 
HAVE SO MANY SIMILARITIES IN SO 
MANY WAYS, JUST VERY DIFFERENT 
AGENDAS, I THINK. 
>> I INTERVIEWED THE PRESIDENT 
RIGHT BEFORE HE ANNOUNCED HIS 
CANDIDACY, HE HAS THIS WAY OF 
KNOWING WHEN THE CAMERA IS ON, 
HOW HE TALKS TO YOU OFF CAMERA 
IS VERY DIFFERENT. 
HE'S CHARISMATIC, AND GENTLE, 
HE FLATTERS YOU. 
WHICH IS PERHAPS WHY HE LIKE 
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS BEEN SO 
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE MEDIA. 
TRUMP KNOWS HOW THE MEDIA 
WORKS, HAVING BEEN A MEDIA 
DARLING FOR SO MANY YEARS, 
ALMOST HIS WHOLE LIFE THAT HE 
HAS DISDAIN FOR IT. 
>> I THINK BOTH OF THESE GUYS. 
PUTIN IN HIS AUTO BIOGRAPHY, A 
CHILDHOOD FRIEND ASKS WHAT HE 
DID. 
THIS IS WHEN HE'S IN THE KGB. 
HE SAID I'M A SPECIALIST IN 
HUMAN RELATIONS. 
ON THE ONE HAND, BEING A SPY IS 
BEING A SPECIALIST, BUT 
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO WORK 
PEOPLE, HOW TO DEVELOP SOURCES, 
HOW TO DEVELOP INFORMATION. 
TRUMP IS A SPECIALIST IN HUMAN 
RELATIONS BECAUSE HE'S A REAL 
ESTATE TYCOON WHO MADE HIS 
MONEY IN THE CITY IN THE 1980s. 
HE VIEWS THE RELATIONSHIP AS 
THE THING ITSELF, AS THE GOAL 
ITSELF. 
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. 
HE SAYS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP 
WITH PUTIN IS GREAT. 
WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, 
IT'S A KIND OF TRANSACTIONAL 
SORT OF RELATIONSHIP APPROACH 
TO POLITICS. 
IN WHICH, YOU KNOW, AGAIN FROM 
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ORIGIN 
POINTS, THEY'RE SPECIALISTS IN 
HUMAN RELATIONS. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> PLEASURE AS ALWAYS. 
>>> NEWLY RELEASED BODY CAM 
VIDEO SHOWS THE MOMENTS BEFORE 
THE DEADLY POLICE SHOOTING OF 
AN ARMED BLACK MAN IN CHICAGO. 
THE VIDEO APPEARS TO SHOW 37-
YEAR-OLD HARITH AUGUSTUS REACH 
FOR HIS GUN BEFORE AN OFFICER 
OPENS FIRE AND KILLS HIM. 
>> SEVERAL DEMONSTRATORS WERE 
ARRESTED AFTER CLASHES WITH 
POLICE NEAR THE SHOOTING SCENE 
SATURDAY. 
DEAN REYNOLDS IS FOLLOWING THE 
LATEST. 
>> FOUR OFFICERS APPROACH 
HARITH AUGUSTUS ON A SOUTH SIDE 
CHICAGO SIDEWALK. 
HE PULLS AWAY WHEN ONE OFFICER 
TRIES TO GRAB HIS WRIST, 
REVEALING WHAT POLICE SAY IS A 
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON ON HIS 
RIGHT HIP. 
AN OFFICER OPENED FIRE WHEN HE 
APPEARED TO REACH FOR A GUN. 
>> THE DECISION TO USE LETHAL 
FORCE IS MADE IN A SPLIT SECOND 
AND IT'S BASED ON THE SAFETY OF 
THE OFFICER AND OFFICERS 
SURROUNDING THE COMMUNITY. 
>> PEOPLE WHO KNEW AUGUSTUS SAY 
HE WORKED AS A BARBER AND HAD A 
5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. 
>> PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. 
THIS WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
COMMUNITY. 
HE WASN'T A BAD PERSON. 
>> DEMONSTRATORS CONVERGED NEAR 
THE SHOOTING SITE SATURDAY 
THROWING BOTTLES AND TRASH, 
JUMPING ON A SQUAD CAR AND 
CLASHING WITH OFFICERS WHO 
RESPONDED WITH BATONS. 
THERE WERE FOUR ARRESTS AND 
SOME OFFICERS WERE HURT. 
>> HOW MANY SHOTS, 16 SHOTS. 
>> YESTERDAY, DOZENS GATHERED 
AGAIN FOR A MARCH. 
>> WE BELIEVE IN JUSTICE AND WE 
HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE COME 
TOGETHER AS A PEOPLE. 
>> SOME PROTESTERS SAID 
SATURDAY'S INCIDENT WAS 
REMINISCENT OF THE DEADLY 
POLICE SHOOTING OF 17-YEAR-OLD 
LAQUAN McDONALD IN 2014. 
McDONALD WAS SHOT 16 TIMES AS 
HE WALKED AWAY FROM POLICE, AND 
WAS AROUND ONLY WITH A POCKET 
KNIFE. 
POLICE VIDEO OF THAT INCIDENT 
WASN'T MADE PUBLIC FOR MORE 
THAN A YEAR. 
POLICE SAY VIDEO OF SATURDAY'S 
SHOOTING SHOWS A KEY 
DIFFERENCE. 
>> THIS WAS NOT AN UNARMED 
INDIVIDUAL. 
THE INDIVIDUAL WAS ARMED. 
NOW WHY HE CHOSE TO DO WHAT HE 
DID, I DON'T KNOW. 
>>> COMING UP AFTER A BREAK, 
WHILE THE THAI SOCCER TEAM 
CONTINUES TO RECOVER AT THE 
HOSPITAL, THEY HAVE REUNITED 
WITH ONE OF THE RESCUERS THAT 
KEPT THEM SAFE INSIDE THE CAVE. 
>>> AND A WOMAN WHO PLUNGED 
HUNDREDS OF FEET OVER A CLIFF 
IN CALIFORNIA TELLS HER 
INCREDIBLE STORY OF SURVIVAL. 
YOU WILL NOT WANT TO MISS THIS. 
KEEP IT RIGHT HERE. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, CBS NEWS 
ALWAYS ON. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TELLS CBS 
NEWS THAT HE COULD HAVE A VERY 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN. 
>> BEFORE TODAY'S MEETING, MR. 
TRUMP SPOKE WITH CBS EVENING 
NEWS JEFF GLOR AT TRUMP TURN 
BERRY RESORT IN SCOTLAND. 
>> WHAT'S YOUR GOAL FOR THE 
PUTIN MEETING. 
>> I'LL LET YOU KNOW AFTER THE 
MEETING. 
IT WAS MUTUALLY AGREED, LET'S 
HAVE A MEETING, I THINK IT'S A 
GOOD THING TO MEET. 
I DO BELIEVE IN MEETINGS. 
LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT HAVING A 
MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS A 
GOOD THING. 
I THINK HAVING MEETINGS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA WAS A 
VERY GOOD THING. 
I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY GOOD, SO 
HAVING MEETINGS WITH RUSSIA, 
CHINA, NORTH KOREA, I BELIEVE 
IN IT. 
NOTHING BAD IS GOING TO COME 
OUT OF IT, AND MAYBE SOME GOOD 
WILL COME OUT, BUT I GO IN WITH 
LOW EXPECTATION, I'M NOT GOING 
WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS. 
I DON'T REALLY, I CAN'T TELL 
YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT 
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I'LL BE 
ASKING FOR, AND WE'LL SEE IF 
SOMETHING COMES OF IT. 
>> THE RUSSIANS WHO WERE 
INDICTED, WOULD YOU ASK PUTIN 
TO SEND THEM HERE? 
>> WELL, I MIGHT. 
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. 
CERTAINLY I'LL BE ASKING ABOUT 
IT. 
THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THE WERE DOING WHATEVER IT WAS 
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 
AND I HEARD THAT THEY WERE 
TRYING OR PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO 
HACK INTO THE RNC, TOO, THE 
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. 
BUT WE HAD MUCH BETTER 
DEFENSES. 
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT BY A 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE. 
WE HAD MUCH BETTER DEFENSES SO 
THEY COULDN'T. 
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 
HACKED. 
THEY HAD BAD DEFENSES AND THEY 
WERE ABLE TO BE HACKED. 
I HEARD THEY WERE TRYING TO 
HACK THE REPUBLICANS, TOO, BUT, 
AND THIS MAY BE WRONG, BUT THEY 
HAD MUCH STRONGER DEFENSES. 
>> AND JEFF GLOR IS HERE WITH 
US NOW. 
GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
>> GOOD TO BE HERE. 
>> THIS WAS A FASCINATING 
INTERVIEW AND I KNOW YOU'RE 
GOING TO BE INTERVIEWING THE 
PRESIDENT AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY IN 
WASHINGTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE, 
AND YOU KNOW, YOUR MEET AND 
GREET WITH THE PRESIDENT MADE 
HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES SUGGESTED IN 
ANTICIPATION OF THIS MEETING 
THAT THE FOE, HIS FOE, THE WAY 
HE SAW IT WAS THE EUROPEAN 
UNION AND HE CALLED RUSSIA A 
COMPETITOR. 
>> IT'S NOT A PLAIN QUESTION, 
SORT OF CAME UP DURING THE 
COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION AS 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT NATO. 
I SAID WHO'S YOUR BIGGEST 
COMPETITOR RIGHT NOW, YOUR 
BIGGEST FOE GLOBALLY, AND THE 
FIRST THING HE SAID WAS THE 
EUROPEAN UNION. 
HE DID FOLLOW UP WITH CHINA AND 
RUSSIA AS WELL. 
AND I FOLLOWED UP WITH HIM, I 
SAID SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE 
SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU SAY THE 
EU FIRST AND HE DOUBLED DOWN. 
THERE IS THIS INTENSE FOCUS 
RIGHT NOW ON TRYING TO INCREASE 
THESE NATO PAYMENTS, AND ON 
REDOING THESE TRADE DEALS N. ÃºT 
WHITE HOUSE AND THIS PRESIDENT 
SEE THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A FOE 
IN THAT SENSE, THAT IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO NOT 
AN ENEMY IN WAR, BUT CERTAINLY 
SOMETHING THAT THEY BELIEVE HAS 
TO BE DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY. 
>> DID YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT 
HE WOULD CONSIDER A WIN COMING 
OUT OF THIS SUMMIT OR MEETING, 
CONSIDERING HE SORT OF SAID TO 
YOU HE DIDN'T HAVE AN AGENDA 
GOING INTO IT? 
>> THE PRESIDENT, HE CLEARLY 
DOES LIKE THESE ONE ON ONE 
SETTINGS, AND DOES BELIEVE THAT 
HE CAN GET A READ ON SOMEONE 
FAIRLY QUICKLY. 
YOU GET TO KNOW SOMEONE BETTER 
THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND WITH 
THEM. 
I DO THINK WHETHER IT'S 
VLADIMIR PUTIN OR ANGELA MERKEL 
OR EMMANUEL MACRON HOWEVER 
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS HAS GONE, 
HE WANTS TO SPEND TIME IN ONE 
ON ONE SETTINGS. 
DOES HE WANT TO HAVE MORE OF AN 
OPEN CONVERSATION AND SEE HOW 
IT GOES, YEAH, I THINK SO. 
DOES VLADIMIR PUTIN PROBABLY 
HAVE A MORE CONCRETE AGENDA IN 
TERMS OF DELIVERABLES THAT HE 
WANTS? 
YEAH. 
ARE THOSE WORKABLE BETWEEN 
THEM? 
SURE. 
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. 
I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE 
REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE IS 
WHO BOTH OF THEM, ESPECIALLY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, SPEAK TO 
AFTER, BEFORE THEY GO TO THIS 
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE AND THEN 
HOW LONG THAT PRESS Câ ONFERENCE 
IS. 
THERE WAS THIS FASCINATING, 
EXHAUSTIVE LONG PRESS 
CONFERENCE AFTER SINGAPORE, 
RIGHT, WHERE IT WAS AN HOUR AND 
15 MINUTES. 
IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN POST 
PUTIN MEETING,AND WHAT WILL HE 
SAY. 
>> RIGHT. 
THE OTHER INTERESTING THING, I 
THINK, QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED 
WHICH GOT A MORE PECULIAR 
RESPONSE FROM THE PRESIDENT, 
YOU ASKED ABOUT RUSSIAN 
NATIONALS THAT HAVE BEEN 
INDICTED. 
THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T HAVE 
AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH 
RUSSIA, THE ONLY WAY TO GET 
THEM TO FACE JUSTICE IS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
TO ASK THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, 
AND HE SAID HE HADN'T THOUGHT 
OF THAT. 
>> NOT JUST THE ONES INDICT 
INSTEAD THIS ROUND BUT THE LAST 
ONES, TOO, A COUPLE DOZEN NOW 
POTENTIALLY WOULD BE 
EXTRADITED. 
IT IS HARD TO SEE A WORLD IN 
THAT PUTIN WOULD SEND THEM 
HERE, BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW 
MUCH PRESSURE IS APPLIED, HOW 
THAT REQUEST IS MADE, WHETHER 
THERE'S ANY WIGGLE ROOM TO HAVE 
THAT DONE. 
AGAIN, HARD TO SEE THAT 
HAPPENING IN ANY WAY. 
BUT HE SAID HE WOULD THINK 
ABOUT IT. 
AND NOW WOULD ASK PUTIN ABOUT 
IT. 
>> IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE WHEN 
IT COMES TO THE RUSSIA 
INVESTIGATION OR RUSSIAN 
MEDDLING, THAT TOPIC, IT'S 
CONNECTED TO THE RUSSIA 
INVESTIGATION FOR HIM. 
HE CAN'T KIND OF SEPARATE THE 
TWO, AND HE REPEATEDLY CALLED 
IT A WITCH HUNT AGAIN. 
>> I DO THINK THE SEPARATION IS 
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT 
THE MEDDLING AND THE RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IS ONE THING. 
HE SAYS IT'S A WITCH HUNT WHEN 
HE TALKS ABOUT JUST GOING AFTER 
HIM IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT, 
YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY 
DO ANYTHING WRONG, HOWEVER YOU 
DEBATE HOW MUCH RUSSIANS 
AFFECTED OUR ELECTION, BUT THE 
INTERESTING PART ABOUT THIS IS 
WHAT THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE DAN COATES SAID 
THE OTHER DAY, WE ARE AT THIS 
CRITICAL POINT WHEN IT COMES 
OUR DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, 
LIKE WE WERE PRE9/11, IN TERMS 
OF CLOSE TO A POTENTIAL MAJOR 
VERY BAD ATTACK. 
AND THOSE ARE THE SIGNS THEY'RE 
SEEING FROM THE RUSSIANS AND 
THE NORTH KOREANS AND OTHERS 
AGAIN, IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO PENETRATE. 
>> AND THE NORTH KOREANS. 
>> AND THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IN 
17 YEARS. 
YOU ATTACK, YOU CARRY OUT 
TERROR ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT 
WAYS THAN YOU DID 20 YEARS AGO. 
I DID ASK HIM ABOUT WHAT THE 
DNI SAID. 
HE SAID, LISTEN, I'M AWARE OF 
THAT. 
HE DIDN'T BITE TOO MUCH ON 
THAT. 
BUT I THINK SOME OF THE 
COMMENTS FROM COATES HAVE BEEN 
INTERESTING. 
>> AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, YOU 
PLAN ON INTERVIEWING THE 
PRESIDENT WEDNESDAY, GIVEN WHAT 
HE SAID THIS WEEKEND, AND WHAT 
WE EXPECT TO SEE COMING OUT OF 
THIS RUSSIA MEETING, GIVE US A 
PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING 
TO HEAR FROM HIM? 
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING HIM 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN HELSINKI 
HERE, WHAT HIS SENSE OF, YOU 
KNOW, HE'LL HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
IT A COUPLE OF TIMES. 
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING AND 
APPEALING FOR US IS WE'LL GET A 
CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM, YOU 
KNOW, AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN I 
THINK HE'S HAD A CHANCE TO 
RESET A LITTLE BIT BACK HERE. 
AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THINGS GO 
SORT OF POST MEETING, POST 
SUMMIT, WHATEVER YOU CARE TO 
CALL IT. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> AFTER THIS. 
AND THEN WHAT COMES NEXT WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, NOW THAT THEY 
WILL HAVE MET, WHATEVER IT IS, 
3, 3 1/2 TIMES. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THE 
BODY LANGUAGE. 
THAT'S ALL WE HAD AT THIS 
INITIAL MEETING THAT WE SAW. 
SO I WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM 
YOU, DID HE SEEM RELAXED. 
>> HE SEEMED LIKE IT'S THE 
SAME, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT 
PREFERS TO SIT FORWARD LIKE 
THIS, AND YOU KNOW, PUTIN WAS A 
LITTLE MORE. 
>> BUT IN YOUR INTERVIEW. 
>> OH, IN THE INTERVIEW, IT WAS 
THE SAME. 
THE WAY I EXPECTED HIM TO SIT, 
THE WAY HE ALWAYS SITS IN ALL 
OF THESE MEETINGS AND FOR ME AT 
LEAST SITTING ACROSS, I'M JUST 
TRYING TO BE COMFORTABLE, 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE WHOEVER IT 
IS I'M TALKING TO IS COMFORT  
-- COMFORTABLE, AND YOU'RE ABLE 
TO SPEAK OPENLY. 
>> YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE BODY 
LANGUAGE ALL DAY. 
>> WHETHER IT'S THIS, WHETHER 
IT'S PUTIN, AND TRUMP MEETING, 
IT'S SUPER FASCINATING TO 
SPECULATE ABOUT. 
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT 
ACTUALLY MEANS BUT IT IS 
INTERESTING. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS 
INTERVIEW ON WEDNESDAY, JEFF. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING. 
>> AND WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE 
TONIGHT ON THE EVENING NEWS,

THEY CAN BE SEEN HUGGING THE 
THAI NAVY SEAL WHO TOOK CARE OF 
THEM IN THE CAVE.

THAT WEIGHT BACK. 
MEANWHILE, THEIR PARENTS WERE

TIME FOR A CEREMONY. 
VOLUNTEERS ALONG WITH THE 
FAMILIES GATHERED AT THE CAVE 
ON MONDAY WHERE THE 12 BOYS AND 
THEIR SOCCER COACH WERE RESCUED 
AFTER BEING TRAPPED FOR MORE 
THAN TWO WEEKS.

GRATEFUL.

THOSE BOYS AND THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE COME TO PAY THEIR 
RESPECTS.

CEREMONY WAS ALSO HELD FOR THE 
FORMER THAI NAVY SEAL WHO DIED 
DURING THE RESCUE MISSION.

EARLIER THE GOVERNMENT RELEASED 
THESE VIDEO CLIPS OF THE BOYS,

WELL AND THANKED THEIR 
RESCUERS. 
THAI OFFICIALS HOPE THE ENTIRE 
GROUP WILL GO HOME BY THURSDAY. 
>>> NOW, THE PARENTS ACTUALLY 
WENT INTO THE CAVE THIS 
AFTERNOON FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE THE BOYS WERE RESCUED. 
ONE FATHER TOLD US IT WAS VERY 
SPOOKY FOR HIM BECAUSE HE HAD 
BEEN PREPARING HIMSELF FOR THE 
IDEA THAT HIS SON MIGHT NEVER 
EMERGE ALIVE FROM THAT CAVE 
AGAIN. 
>> ANNA WERNER, THANK YOU. 
>>> AN OREGON WOMAN WHO 
DISAPPEARED A WEEK AGO WAS

>> WE SAW A BUMPER FIRST, AND 
WE WERE LIKE THERE'S A BUMPER, 
THAT'S WEIRD AND CAME AROUND A 
BEND AND SAW THE CAR. 
>> THIS IS THE CAR CHELSEA AND
