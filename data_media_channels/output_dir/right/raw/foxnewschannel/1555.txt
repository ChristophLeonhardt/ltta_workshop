1
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:11,616
>> Trace: ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:13,951
WHAT ABOUT MULTIPLE INFORMANTS

3
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:15,553
THAT HAVE PENETRATED THE TRUMP

4
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:17,355
CAMPAIGN IN THE FALL OF 2016?

5
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:18,756
IF IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE, HEAR

6
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:21,759
THE REASONING BEHIND THIS.

7
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:27,098
FORMER TRUMP AIDE QUERIED BY

8
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:30,468
MICHAEL CAPUTO THANKS FOR BEING

9
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:30,768
BACK.

10
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:35,272
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

11
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:36,807
>> Neil: SO YOU'RE CONVINCED

12
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:37,975
THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE

13
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:38,376
INDIVIDUAL?

14
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:39,243
>> YES, I AM.

15
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:43,114
TO MY APPROACH, IT HAPPENED IN

16
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:44,949
THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY OF 2016.

17
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,717
FAR OFF THE TIMELINE THAT THE

18
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,386
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND OTHERS

19
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:50,187
ARE TRYING TO HOLD TO IT TO WHEN

20
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:52,556
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE TRUMP

21
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:54,325
CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY BEGAN.

22
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:57,228
>> Trace: SO WHEN YOU SAY MAY OF

23
00:00:57,228 --> 00:00:58,896
2016, WHAT HAPPENED?

24
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,398
THE DISCOVERY OF SOMEBODY

25
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:01,265
PENETRATING THE CAMPAIGN OR

26
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:01,565
WHAT?

27
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:04,635
>> I WAS APPROACHED BY AN ENTER

28
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:07,972
MEDIATORY WHO HAD BEEN TALKING

29
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:10,474
TO A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, A

30
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:12,043
FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, THAT

31
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:14,679
TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD HILLARY

32
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:16,914
CLINTON-RELATED E-MAILS AT THAT

33
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,082
GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION AND THAT

34
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:20,217
THEY WANTED TO GET THEM TO THE

35
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:21,118
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,156
THIS WAS MAY 6 THAT HE HEARD

37
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:27,992
THAT IN 2016.

38
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:30,127
I WAS TOLD BY THE INTERMEDIARY

39
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:32,196
THAT THEY WANTED TO GET THEM TO

40
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:32,463
ME.

41
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:33,397
THIS CONTINUED BACK AND FORTH

42
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:33,964
SEVERAL DAYS.

43
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:35,299
I WAS IN TRUMP TOWER AT THE TIME

44
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,834
WHEN I GOT A CALL.

45
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,836
I WOULD WALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE.

46
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,238
I SPENT TIME IN THE HALLWAY

47
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:44,275
OUTSIDE THE FIFTH FLOOR OFFICE

48
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:45,743
TALKING TO THIS ENTER MEDIATORY.

49
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:46,977
>> Neil: AT TRUMP

50
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,713
>> YES, SIR.

51
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:49,380
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

52
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,817
SO YOU -- YOU'RE A TOP CAMPAIGN

53
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:58,189
AIDE IN THE SPRING OF 2016.

54
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:58,723
THIS INTERMEDIARY.

55
00:01:58,723 --> 00:01:59,390
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

56
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,726
>> IT'S A FRIEND OF MINE THAT IS

57
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:03,394
WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD AT

58
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,195
THE RIGHT TIME.

59
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,197
WE'RE HERE ON YOUR SHOW TO BE

60
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:07,398
CAUTIOUS ABOUT NAMES OF PEOPLE

61
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:08,532
AND ORGANIZATIONS.

62
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:10,935
HE WANTS TO BE ON THE RECORD,

63
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:12,503
HE'S WILLING TO TALK TO FOX.

64
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:14,839
HE AND I WERE BOTH AMAZED THAT

65
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,240
WE WERE GETTING THIS KIND OF A

66
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,842
CONTACT FROM A GOVERNMENT

67
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:18,275
ORGANIZATION.

68
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,611
>> Neil: WHO WAS TALKING TO THE

69
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:24,081
INTERMEDIARY OR WHAT GOVERNMENT

70
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:24,415
AGENCY?

71
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:26,550
WHAT COULD YOU SAY?

72
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,219
>> I CAN'T SAY THE NAME OF THE

73
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:29,220
GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

74
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,755
IT WAS A FORMER CONTRACTOR FOR

75
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:33,991
THAT AGENCY THAT SAID THE ACTUAL

76
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:35,960
STAFF MEMBERS OF THE AGENCY HAD

77
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,929
HILLARY CLINTON'S RELATED

78
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:39,263
E-MAILS.

79
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:40,564
WE BELIEVE THAT TO MEAN AT THE

80
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:42,933
TIME, EARLY MAY, HILLARY CLINTON

81
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,935
HAD REVEALED THAT SHE HAD

82
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,238
DELETED 30,000 E-MAILS AND WE

83
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:48,038
BELIEVED IT MEANT THAT THEY HAD

84
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:50,908
THOSE 30,000 E-MAILS.

85
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:52,610
BY THE WAY THE TIME MAY 16 CAME

86
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,478
AROUND, I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION

87
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,980
THAT I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE

88
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,082
POSSESSION OF THESE E-MAILS.

89
00:02:58,082 --> 00:02:59,817
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE

90
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:01,585
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

91
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:02,787
I URGED THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY

92
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:03,854
THAT THE PEOPLE AT THE

93
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:04,855
GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION DO IT

94
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:07,491
THROUGH A PROPER WHISTLE-BLOWER

95
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:07,825
PROCESS.

96
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:10,394
I NEVER REVEALED THIS

97
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:11,595
CONVERSATION TO ANYONE AT THE

98
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:12,329
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

99
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,799
I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING

100
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,566
ABOUT IT.

101
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:18,636
I THEN BROKE OFF CONTACT WITH

102
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,104
THAT GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION

103
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:20,571
REPRESENTATIVE.

104
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:22,306
>> Neil: BUT YOU KNEW THEN THAT

105
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,775
SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE WANTED

106
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,477
TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE ON THE

107
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:30,181
INSIDE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,

108
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:31,048
BEGINNING WITH YOU.

109
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:31,749
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

110
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:33,617
I LEFT THE CAMPAIGN ON JUNE

111
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:34,485
20th.

112
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,320
THAT SAME PERSON, THE FORMER

113
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,455
CONTRACTOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT

114
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:40,357
ORGANIZATION REACHED BACK OUT TO

115
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:41,592
THE INTERMEDIARY IN THE END OF

116
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:43,260
JEWEL TRYING TO GET HIM

117
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,229
INTERESTING AGAIN IN THOSE

118
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,563
E-MAILS.

119
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,598
HE AGAIN REFUSED TO WORK WITH

120
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:48,332
THEM ON IT.

121
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:52,469
WHAT REALLY DISTURBED ME AT THE

122
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,438
TIME, NEIL, I -- YOU KNOW, I

123
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:55,940
DIDN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN

124
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,042
BRINGING IN THIS KIND OF

125
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:58,442
INFORMATION.

126
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:01,078
I THOUGHT IT MADE ME LOOK COOKY

127
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:02,613
WHEN I CAME IN TO TELL THEM I

128
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:04,615
HAD ACCESS TO HILLARY CLINTON'S

129
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,284
DELETED E-MAILS.

130
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:08,886
THEN IT WAS FRIGHTENING FOR ME.

131
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,254
IT COULD BE A CRIME FOR ME TO

132
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:13,057
TAKE THEM IN MY OWN CUSTODY.

133
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:16,327
LATER ON I WAS -- I GAVE THIS

134
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:17,161
INFORMATION TO THE HOUSE

135
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:19,363
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

136
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:21,098
I GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO THE

137
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,099
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

138
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,101
AND I GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO

139
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,035
THE MUELLER TEAM.

140
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:27,638
THEY NEVER REACHED OUT TO THE

141
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:29,373
INTERMEDIARY TO CHECK ON IT.

142
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:31,308
>> Neil: SO YOU RAISED -- TO BE

143
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:32,576
CLEAR, YOU RAISED THIS ISSUE

144
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,379
WITH MUELLER'S TEAM WHEN THEY

145
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,481
WERE QUESTIONING YOU.

146
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,549
THEY DID NOTHING?

147
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,217
>> THEY WEREN'T EVEN INTERESTED.

148
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:42,286
THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TAKING

149
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:42,586
NOTES.

150
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,021
I OFFERED THEM THE TIMELINE --

151
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:47,057
>> Neil: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

152
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:47,358
THAT?

153
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,059
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE

154
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:53,063
FROM THE POSSIBILITY TRYING TO

155
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:54,765
PENETRATE THE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL

156
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:55,132
CAMPAIGN.

157
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:57,134
DID THEY FOLLOW YOU UP ON THAT?

158
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,802
>> THEY DIDN'T.

159
00:04:58,936 --> 00:04:59,937
INTERMEDIARY WHO WAS WILLING TO

160
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:01,739
GO ON THE RECORD ABOUT IT.

161
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,641
I HAVE THE TELEPHONE NUMBER OF

162
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,441
THE FORMER GOVERNMENT

163
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,276
REPRESENTATIVE THAT WAS TRYING

164
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,343
TO GIVE THIS TO US.

165
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:08,212
I DON'T THINK THEY CALLED HIM AS

166
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:08,779
WELL.

167
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:12,549
HE'S KIND OF GONE SILENT.

168
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,184
>> Neil: WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU

169
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:15,586
WHEN THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN

170
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:15,886
THAT?

171
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:18,422
>> I WAS PUMPED UP ABOUT THIS

172
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:20,557
FROM THE BEGINNING.

173
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:22,693
AT FIRST I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT

174
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:23,027
IT.

175
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:25,162
WHEN I WAS ASKED BY THE HOUSE

176
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:26,597
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN ALL-IF

177
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:29,099
ANYONE OFFERED ME E-MAILS, THEY

178
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,434
ASKED ME IF ANY RUSSIAN OFFERED

179
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,669
ME E-MAILS.

180
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,070
DIDN'T COME TO MIND THAT SOMEONE

181
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,837
FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

182
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:34,571
APPARENTLY WAS TRYING TO OFFER

183
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,141
ME E-MAILS.

184
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:39,977
I CAME BACK TO THE HOUSE

185
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:42,279
PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON

186
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,180
INTELLIGENCE AFTER RECALLING

187
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,848
THIS AT LATER DATE AND GAVE THEM

188
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:45,616
THAT TIME LINE.

189
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,885
DIDN'T SEEM TO INTEREST THEM

190
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:48,218
EITHER.

191
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:52,423
>> Neil: THERE'S SO MUCH YOU CAN

192
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:53,457
SURMISE FROM THAT.

193
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:58,762
I WOULDN'T OFFER ANY CONJECTURE.

194
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:09,340
KNOWING THERE'S ONE PERSON

195
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:13,444
I WOULDN'T OFFER ANY CONJECTURE.
KNOWING THERE'S ONE PERSON

196
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:14,278
TRYING TO PENETRATE THE TRUMP

197
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:15,012
CAMPAIGN AND MAYBE MORE, DID IT

198
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:15,713
DAWN ON YOU THE DIMENSIONS OF

199
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:16,447
THAT AT THE TIME TO SAY NOTHING

200
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:17,081
OF LATER ON WHEN YOU WERE

201
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:17,748
TALKING TO MUELLER AND HIS

202
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:18,048
FOLKS?

203
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:18,782
>> I'LL TELL YOU, AT THE TIME IT

204
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:19,516
DIDN'T -- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT

205
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:19,850
WAS ODD.

206
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,584
I THOUGHT IT WAS PERILOUS FOR ME

207
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:21,151
TO GET MY HANDS ON IT.

208
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:21,952
YOU KNOW, I FRANKLY DIDN'T THINK

209
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:22,653
ABOUT IT MUCH AFTER THAT.

210
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:24,421
THEN THE E-MAILS WERE RELEASED

211
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:27,491
IN OCTOBER FROM WIKILEAKS.

212
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,026
I REMEMBERED THAT THE GOVERNMENT

213
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:32,162
PERSON WHO WAS CONTACTING ME

214
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:35,966
THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY TALKED

215
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,634
ABOUT THE SWEDISH OR WAIVER ON

216
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:39,403
DEALING WITH IRAN THAT WAS GIVEN

217
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:40,938
TO THE SWEDISH COMPANIES RIGHT

218
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:42,873
ABOUT THE TIME THAT THEY GAVE

219
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:45,142
$26 MILLION TO THE CLINTON

220
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:45,542
FOUNDATION.

221
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:48,579
THAT CAME OUT IN THE WIKILEAKS

222
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,446
E-MAILS IN LATE OCTOBER.

223
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,647
I BLEW MY MIND.

224
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:52,282
I REMEMBER THEN I WAS NOT ON THE

225
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,484
CAMPAIGN BY THEN.

226
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:54,418
I REMEMBERED THAT THAT HAD BEEN

227
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:57,821
BROUGHT UP IN THE FIRST WEEK OF

228
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:58,088
MAY.

229
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:01,358
TO ME IT STRUCK ME WHY ARE WE

230
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,560
TALKING ABOUT WIKILEAKS E-MAILS

231
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,029
THAT SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO GIVE

232
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,331
ME IN MAY.

233
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:12,836
>> Neil: STARTLING.

234
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,138
A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE AS TO

235
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:17,574
WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING

236
00:07:17,574 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS, WHY WERE SEVERAL
