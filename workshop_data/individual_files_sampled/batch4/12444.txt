now I want to talk a little bit about the latest on the stormy Daniel scandal whose stormy Daniels stormy Daniels hit her lawyer Michael a vanetti was interviewed by megan kelly megan kelly is a fantastic interviewer she's a great prosecutor right this is what she is best at right the stuff that she's best at I you know I think she's okay at all of the kind of morning show hosts kind of stuff but the stuff that Megan just dominates and she's terrific at is when she asks hard questions to people she was great at this on Fox News and she just grilled Michael a vanetti last night and it was brutal why would you why would stormy Daniels be leading the charge on whether whether that payment violated the election law because and I mean this is the honest-to-god truth this is a principled woman at this point she wants the truth she wants the truth now now they're laughing at you know what she's so principled that 11 days before the election she had information about the possible next president having an extramarital affair with a with an adult film actress and she shut up about it in exchange for just over a hundred grand yeah and I think she's providing an explanation as to why that is it's because she wanted the money she wants she wants she wants the truth to be known to the American people and why should she take the money why didn't she just talk 11 days before the election you'd have to ask her that I don't have a nice come on she wanted the dough okay so this is where megyn kelly is fantastic of every show or like this with megyn kelly her ready to be phenomenal because that's amazing television that is so good and she's exactly right of course it's amazing how the media can't stand any of these psychological cognitive dissonance that that people experience every day in order for them to say that Trump did something bad her they have to say the stormy Daniels is some sort of heroine stormy Daniels is kind of gross okay this is a woman who had an affair with a married man you know it again on the television show and then took a bunch of money to shut up about it before the election and now she knows she will make more money if she doesn't take that money start so the best part of this was megyn kelly actually asked Michael a vanity listen if she didn't want the money then why is it still in her bank account like you she could just give the money back right that could be a thing that would actually happen and that is not what happened right I mean so she did not actually give the money back obviously and the and the impact of that is that she shut up for the for the duration of the election pretty amazing stuff so good for megyn kelly for finally asking some questions it just shows the desperation of the left they've tried to make some sort of martyr out of stormy Daniels who's anything but a martyr anything but a martyr amazing
