1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,034
DEMOCRATS HAVE EYED FLAKE'S 

2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,169
SEAT AS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF 

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,639
THEIR PLAN TO REGAIN CONTROL OF 

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,708
THE SENATE AND REPUBLICANS HAVE 

5
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:09,743
SOUGHT TO REPLACE FLAKE WHO WAS 

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,444
A FREQUENT CRITIC OF PRESIDENT 

7
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,812
TRUMP WITH A MORE CONSERVATIVE 

8
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:13,045
VOICE. 

9
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,447
ONE THING MISSING FROM THAT 

10
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,649
REPUBLICAN RACE, THOUGH, HAS 

11
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,951
BEEN A PRESIDENTIAL 

12
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,284
ENDORSEMENT. 

13
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,252
YOU SEE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

14
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,122
NOT WADED INTO THE SENATE RACE, 

15
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,856
ALTHOUGH ALL THREE CANDIDATES 

16
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,558
USED THE PRESIDENT'S NAME TO 

17
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,025
GARNER SUPPORT. 

18
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,427
THE PRESIDENT HAS, HOWEVER, 

19
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,295
JUMPED INTO THE REPUBLICAN 

20
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,830
PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR OVER IN 

21
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,264
FLORIDA. 

22
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:35,768
IN A MONDAY TWEET MR. TRUMP 

23
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,237
ENDORSED CONGRESSMAN RON 

24
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,439
DESANTOS PRAISING HIS RECORD ON 

25
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,642
CRIME AND BORDER SECURITY AND 

26
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,477
SAYING HE'S DONE A "INCREDIBLE 

27
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,645
JOB." 

28
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,148
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS NOW. 

29
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,917
JOINING ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON 

30
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,185
IS WHITE HOUSE McCLATCHY 

31
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:55,421
CORRESPONDENT ANITA KUMAR AND 

32
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:55,988
WHITE HOUSE REPORTER ZEKE 

33
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:56,221
MILLER. 

34
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:59,058
BOTH FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN AS I 

35
00:00:59,058 --> 00:00:59,959
THROW THESE QUESTIONS OUT, 

36
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,928
ALTHOUGH I'LL THROW THE FIRST 

37
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:02,361
QUESTION TO ANITA. 

38
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:03,530
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WHITE 

39
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,332
HOUSE IS WAITING AND WATCHING 

40
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,101
FOR IN TONIGHT'S PRIMARY 

41
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:08,668
ELECTIONS IN ARIZONA AND IN 

42
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:08,935
FLORIDA? 

43
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,770
>> Reporter:  THE PRESIDENT 

44
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,172
OBVIOUSLY IS LOOKING FOR HIS 

45
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,440
CANDIDATE, RON DESANTOS, TO WIN 

46
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,141
THE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY THERE 

47
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,043
IN FLORIDA AND THIS IS SOMEONE 

48
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,745
HE SUPPORTED NUMEROUS TIMES, 

49
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,047
NOT JUST IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. 

50
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,516
HE ALSO DID AN EVENT FOR HIM. 

51
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:27,854
IN THE PRIMARY IN ARIZONA IT'S 

52
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,187
INTERESTING. 

53
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:29,122
THERE ARE THREE CANDIDATES 

54
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:29,756
RUNNING, THREE PRIMARY 

55
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,757
CANDIDATES ON THE REPUBLICAN 

56
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,760
SIDE, WHO ARE ALL TRYING TO SAY 

57
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,229
THAT THEY ARE THE TRUMP 

58
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:36,529
CANDIDATE. 

59
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,031
THEY'RE ALL ADVERTISING MAILERS 

60
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,334
AND TV ADS WITH DONALD TRUMP, 

61
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,137
BUT OBVIOUSLY HE IS NOT 

62
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:44,737
ENDORSED IN THAT ONE. 

63
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,139
>> ZEKE, ALL THE CANDIDATES IN 

64
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,840
THE ARIZONA SENATE RACE HAVE 

65
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,943
REALLY EMBRACED PRESIDENT TRUMP 

66
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,210
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. 

67
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,445
SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO, OF COURSE, 

68
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,546
WAS PARDONED BY THE PRESIDENT, 

69
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,515
BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS 

70
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,283
NOT MADE AN ENDORSEMENT. 

71
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,317
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? 

72
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:00,753
>> Reporter:  THERE ARE A 

73
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,021
COUPLE OF REASONS WHY AND IF 

74
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,525
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS 

75
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,726
PRIMARY RACE IN ARIZONA HASN'T 

76
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,428
BEEN SO MUCH A CAMPAIGN TO WIN, 

77
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,164
BUT FOR SOME OF THESE 

78
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,398
CANDIDATES, PARTICULARLY WARD 

79
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:12,932
AND ARPAIO, IT'S BEEN A 

80
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:13,633
CAMPAIGN REALLY FOR THE 

81
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,003
ENDORSEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT 

82
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:17,570
BECAUSE IN THAT THREE-WAY 

83
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,138
BATTLE THE ASSUMPTION HAS BEEN 

84
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,840
THAT ONE OR THE OTHER, THEY 

85
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,642
WERE CANNIBALIZING BOTH OF EACH 

86
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,343
OTHER THAT A PRESIDENTIAL 

87
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,244
ENDORSEMENT WOULD BOOST THEM 

88
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,646
OVER THE TOP AND THAT GETS TO 

89
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,179
WHY THE PRESIDENT HASN'T 

90
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,148
ENDORSED THERE WHILE ALL THREE 

91
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,049
ARE TRYING TO PUSH AND MAKE THE 

92
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,251
CASE THEY ARE THE MOST TRUMP 

93
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,652
CANDIDATE IN THE RACE, THE BEST 

94
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,355
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN 

95
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,055
THE RACE. 

96
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,223
AGAIN ARIZONA IS A STATE, 

97
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,058
PARTICULARLY THE REPUBLICAN 

98
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,260
VOTERS IN ARIZONA, ARE VERY 

99
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,629
REPUBLICAN AND VERY SUPPORTIVE 

100
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,429
OF THE PRESIDENT. 

101
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,732
THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORS HAVE 

102
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,667
TOLD HIM TO STAY OUT. 

103
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,335
DON'T ENDORSE ARPAIO. 

104
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,573
DON'T ENDORSE WARD. 

105
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,142
THAT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY 

106
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,444
POTENTIALLY DO SALLY WHO IS THE 

107
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,111
ESTABLISHED REPUBLICAN FAVORITE 

108
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:01,380
AND IF YOU LOOK AT GENERAL 

109
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,749
ELECTION MATCH-UPS OF THE FEW 

110
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,250
PUBLIC POLLS OUT THERE AND 

111
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,618
TALKING TO CONSULTANTS OF BOTH 

112
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,253
SIDES OF THE AISLE, THAT WOULD 

113
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,855
BE THE MOST COMPETITIVE MATCH-

114
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,623
UPS FOR REPUBLICANS IN A STATE 

115
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,492
THEY'VE VIEW VITAL TO MAINTAIN 

116
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,459
THEIR SENATE MAJORITY IN FALL. 

117
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,261
SO IF THE PRESIDENT WERE TO 

118
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,963
ENDORSE WARD OR ARPAIO, HE 

119
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,732
SEEMS MOST LIKELY TO WANT TO 

120
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,933
ENDORSE, IT COULD THROW THAT 

121
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,368
SEAT INTO JEOPARDY. 

122
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,069
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT'S 

123
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,038
AIDES HAVE REALLY BEEN MAKING A 

124
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,839
CASE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ENDORSE 

125
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,174
PEOPLE IN THESE OTHER RACES, 

126
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,143
BUT THIS IS THE ONE WHERE YOU 

127
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,510
JUST CAN'T WEIGH IN. 

128
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,845
>> I'M JUST WONDERING TO YOU 

129
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,348
BOTH IF THERE IS AT ALL A 

130
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,449
McCAIN FACTOR IN THERE, 

131
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,450
EVERYONE NOW DEALING WITH THE 

132
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,751
LOSS OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, 

133
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,752
SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT HE 

134
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,754
REPRESENTED AS A STATESMAN, 

135
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,456
WHAT HE REPRESENTED TO ARIZONA 

136
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,158
AND THE DIVISION BETWEEN McCAIN 

137
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,728
AND TRUMP IS ON FULL DISPLAY 

138
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,064
WITH THE PRESIDENT STILL NOT 

139
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,231
COMMENTING DIRECTLY ABOUT 

140
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:53,233
McCAIN'S PASSING. 

141
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,634
ANITA, IS THERE A McCAIN 

142
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,903
FACTOR, DO YOU THINK, IN 

143
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,904
PEOPLE'S MINDS HEADING TO THE 

144
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,237
POLLS? 

145
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,539
>> Reporter:  YEAH. 

146
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,242
I DEFINITELY DO, BUT I THINK 

147
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,042
THAT SORT OF THAT McCAIN/TRUMP 

148
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,877
FACTOR HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THE 

149
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,310
LAST COUPLE YEARS. 

150
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,046
I MEAN DONALD TRUMP TOOK OVER 

151
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,916
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HE'S, 

152
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,250
YOU KNOW, STILL POPULAR WITH 

153
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,251
REPUBLICANS AND McCAIN HAD 

154
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,653
GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT MORE 

155
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,322
UNPOPULAR AS THIS PARTY HAS 

156
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:16,822
SPLIT BETWEEN THE MORE 

157
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,456
ESTABLISHMENT AND DONALD TRUMP 

158
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,659
AND SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO 

159
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,560
BE A FACTOR IN THAT STATE, BUT 

160
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,162
I THINK IT'S A FACTOR ALL OVER 

161
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,530
THE COUNTRY IN THESE ELECTIONS 

162
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,731
THAT ARE HAPPENING. 

163
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,701
I THINK ONE THING THAT ALSO IS 

164
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,203
A FACTOR IS THE PRESIDENT HAS 

165
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,972
TRIED AS MUCH AS HE CAN, AS 

166
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,840
DISCIPLINED AS HE IS OR 

167
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,241
UNDISCIPLINED SOMETIMES TO 

168
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,743
LISTEN TO MITCH McCONNELL, THE 

169
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,476
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. 

170
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,945
IF HE'S REALLY BEEN PUSHED TO 

171
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,247
GET INVOLVED IN A RACE, I THINK 

172
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,749
HE'S TRIED TO LISTEN TO THAT, 

173
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,650
TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIM AND GET 

174
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:44,950
INVOLVED. 

175
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,653
HE EITHER GETS INVOLVED WITH 

176
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,854
WHAT MITCH McCONNELL WANTS OR 

177
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,254
HE STAYS OUT. 

178
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,656
SO THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE 

179
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,257
REASONS THAT YOU'RE SEEING HIM 

180
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:51,657
STAY OUT. 

181
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:54,060
>> ZEKE, DO YOU FEEL THERE'S A 

182
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,962
LEVEL OF THAT, TOO, THAT 

183
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,562
PERHAPS THE ADVICE PRESIDENT 

184
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,664
TRUMP IS GETTING IS TO STAY OUT 

185
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:02,602
OF THE ARIZONA PRIMARY AT THE 

186
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:02,835
MOMENT? 

187
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:03,970
IN SOME CIRCLES THEY DO 

188
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,972
CONSIDER THE PRESIDENT THE 

189
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,139
KINGMAKER CONSIDERING HIS HIGH 

190
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:07,740
POPULARITY WITHIN THE BASE. 

191
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,142
>> Reporter:  THAT'S EXACTLY 

192
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:09,375
RIGHT. 

193
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,376
I TALKED TO WHITE HOUSE 

194
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,944
OFFICIALS ABOUT THIS RACE OVER 

195
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,646
THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS BECAUSE 

196
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,549
AS WE'VE BEEN WATCHING, WE SAW 

197
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,584
HIM ENDORSE FOSTER FRIESS IN 

198
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,752
WYOMING, A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE 

199
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,554
LAST WEEK MEANING THIS WOULD BE 

200
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,156
SORT OF THE NEXT OBVIOUS PLACE 

201
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,190
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO PUT HIS 

202
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,759
FINGER ON THE SCALE IN THAT 

203
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,260
PRIMARY. 

204
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,261
OFFICIALS SAY HE'S BEEN PRETTY 

205
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,162
DISCIPLINED AND THAT'S 

206
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,331
CERTAINLY NOT FOR ANY -- 

207
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,432
THERE'S BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT 

208
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,866
BY THE WHITE HOUSE, POLITICAL 

209
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,570

EXPLAIN TO THE PRESIDENT TIME 

212
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,941
AND AGAIN WHY HE CAN'T ENDORSE 

213
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:42,375
HIM. 

214
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,377
YOU LOOK AT THE TACTICS 

215
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,545
PARTICULARLY ARPAIO AND WARD 

216
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,479

217
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,279
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT 

218
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,548
WHETHER IT BE MENTIONING HIM ON

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,885
PROGRAMS THEY KNOW HE WATCHES 

221
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,153
OR MEDIA THEY KNOW -- THEY'RE 

222
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,055
TRYING TO GET AROUND THE 

223
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,457
FILTER, THE ORGANIZATION AROUND 

224
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,158
THE PRESIDENT TO GET HIM TO 

225
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,694
SORT OF GOAT HIM INTO WADING 

226
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,962
INTO THAT PRIMARY AND SO FAR 

227
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,098
AIDES SAY HE'S BEEN PRETTY 

228
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:05,431
DISCIPLINED. 

229
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,466
NOW WITH POLLS CLOSING IN A 

230
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,301
COUPLE OF HOURS HE HAS NOT 

231
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:08,668
TAKEN THE BAIT. 

232
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,203
>> I WANT TO DO A QUICK GUT 

233
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,471
CHECK WITH BOTH OF YOU BECAUSE 

234
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,539
I WANT TO SWITCH TO THIS OTHER 

235
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,874
TOPIC IN THE NEWS TODAY,

PRESIDET TRUMP ATTACKING

238
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,278
THEM OF SUPPRESSING 

239
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,046
CONSERVATIVE VOICES. 

240
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,948
YOU HAD HIS CHIEF ECONOMIC 

241
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,748
ADVISOR LARRY KUDLOW SPEAKING

TO REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

243
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,451
SAYING THAT THEY ARE LOOKING 

244
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:25,717
INTO IT. 

245
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,053
DO YOU BOTH BUY THIS AS A 

246
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:27,954
LEGITIMATE POSITION THE WHITE 

247
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:34,060
HOUSE IS TAKING OR IS THIS KIND 

248
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,660
OF MORE DISTRACT FROM McCAIN-

249
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:34,994
ISH BEHAVIOR? 

250
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,195
>> Reporter:  TIMES IT'S NOT, 

251
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,263
YOU KNOW, A WHITE HOUSE 

252
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:37,764
POSITION. 

253
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,831
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE 

254
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,166
PRESIDENT HAPPENS TO SEE. 

255
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,367
HE MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY JUST 

256
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,101
GOOGLED HIMSELF AND WAS 

257
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,703
WONDERING WHAT WAS GOING ON. 

258
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,670
A LOT OF TIMES THINGS COMING 

259
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,272
OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ARE JUST 

260
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,176
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SEES 

261
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,477
SOMETHING AND HE WANTS TO KNOW 

262
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,045
WHAT'S GOING ON AND HIS AIDES 

263
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,148
NEED TO FOLLOW SUIT. 

264
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,482
I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. 

265
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,052
>> ANITA, DO YOU BELIEVE 

266
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,053
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REALLY 

267
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,957
GOOGLING HIMSELF OR IS THIS AN 

268
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:05,625
ADVISOR COMING TO HIM SAYING 

269
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,260
MAYBE THIS CAN GET THE BASE 

270
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,493
GOING? 

271
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,661
>> Reporter:  MAYBE HE'S TRYING 

272
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,163
TO DISTRACT OR APPEAL TO HIS 

273
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,364
BASE AND I THINK BOTH THOSE 

274
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,632
THINGS ARE PROBABLY TRUE AND IN 

275
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,066
SOME CASES I THINK IT PROBABLY 

276
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,601
IS WHAT IT SEEMS AT THE SAME 

277
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:15,801
TIME. 

278
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,169
IF IT COULD BE ALL THOSE 

279
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,570
THINGS, I THINK IT IS. 

280
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,506
OFTENTIMES HIS AIDES ARE CAUGHT 

281
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,407
UNAWARE WHAT'S GOING ON. 

282
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,142
IT'S SOMETHING HE HAPPENS TO 

283
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,111
SAY OR TWEET AND THEN SUDDENLY 

284
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,146
IT BECOMES SORT OF WHITE HOUSE 

285
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,048
POLICY THEY HAVE TO LOOK INTO. 

286
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,017
>> ZEKE, WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON 

287
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:31,250
THIS? 

288
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,717
>> Reporter:  YEAH. 

289
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,718
IT CERTAINLY APPEARED TO BE THE 

290
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,320
SORT OF THING THAT WAS SORT OF 

291
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,821
PRESIDENT LED AND THEN STAFF 

292
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,023
DOING THE BACKFILLING TO TRY TO 

293
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,924
BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR WHAT 

294
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:42,328
THE PRESIDENT'S ARTICULATED, 

295
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,029
BUT IT IS INTERESTING. 

296
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,729
THE PRESIDENT ARTICULATING THAT 

297
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,831
COMPLAINT INTO LOOKING INTO 

298
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,699
SOME SORT OF REGULATION OF 

299
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,299
THESE INTERNET COMPANIES WHEN 

300
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,834
ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT 

301
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,803
DID WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE WAS 

302
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,539
ROLL BACK NET NEUTRALITY 

303
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,540
REGULATIONS. 

304
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,609
THE LACK OF CONSISTENCY THAT 

305
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,710
OFTEN FOLLOWS WHEN THE 

306
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,112
PRESIDENT IS ESSENTIALLY 

307
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,147
SETTING THE AGENDA FOR HIS 

308
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,214
ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT A WHOLE 

309
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,784
LOT OF FORETHOUGT AND 

310
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,417
CERTAINLY VERY LITTLE STAFF 

311
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:05,885
CONSULTATIONS THERE. 

312
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,988
THAT REALLY LEADS TO A LOT OF 

313
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,422
INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS THE 

314
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:10,789
ADMINISTRATION. 

315
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:11,257
>> GO AHEAD, ANITA. 

316
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,024
>> Reporter:  LET'S JUST 

317
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,325
REMEMBER THIS IS THE BACKDROP 

318
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,227
OF TWITTER AND FACEBOOK BEING 

319
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,629

320
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,730
OF, YOU KNOW, EXACTLY THE SAME 

321
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:17,963
THING. 

322
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,231
SO HE HAS SOMETHING TO SORT OF 

323
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,167
SAY HEY, LOOK AT THIS CONTEXT 

324
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,268
OF IT'S BEEN HAPPENING AND 

325
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,237
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT A 

326
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:25,604
LITTLE FURTHER. 

327
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:28,140
>> YOU HAD JACK DORSEY ADMIT TO 

328
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,308

A QUICK QUESTION TO YOU BOTH.

WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU'VE 

332
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:35,746
GOOGLED YOURSELVES? 

333
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:36,349
TELL THE TRUTH. 

334
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:36,549
ZEKE? 

335
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,082
COME ON. 

336
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:41,153

340
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:45,791
AN OLD STORY I WROTE. 

341
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,627
>> Reporter:  YEAH. 

342
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,094
THAT'S BASICALLY IT. 

343
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,062
I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP STORIES 

344
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,263
THAT I'VE WRITTEN. 

345
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:52,164
>> THE TYPICAL REPORTERS' 

346
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:52,732
EXCUSE. 

347
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,532
I, TOO, DID IT YESTERDAY. 

348
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,568
A FINAL QUESTION TO YOU BOTH. 

349
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,135
WE HAD THIS NEW REPORT RELEASED 

350
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,538

351
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,872
UNIVERSITY FINDING THAT NEARLY 

352
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,441
3,000 PEOPLE DIED IN HURRICANE 

353
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:02,842
MARIA. 

354
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,110
YOU HAD GOVERNOR RICARDO

2,975. 

358
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:09,849
IT MAKES IT THE DEADLIEST STORM 

359
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,717
FOR AMERICANS IN MORE THAN A 

360
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,118
CENTURY. 

361
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,621
I QUICKLY WANT TO HAVE YOU BOTH 

362
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,623
LISTEN TO AN INTERVIEW MY 

363
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,258
COLLEAGUE DAVID BEGNAUD HAD

00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,093
WITH SAN JUAN'S MAYOR JUST A 

365
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:21,527
SHORT TIME AGO. 

366
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:27,633
>> THIS IS NOT A NUMBER. 

367
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,000
IT'S NOT 2,975. 

368
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,269
