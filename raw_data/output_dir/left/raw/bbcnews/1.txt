00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,780
The BBC wants to answer important
questions facing the US today

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,620
and we need your help.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,980
Yes, you!

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,420
So if you have a story idea, leave a comment below

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,020
and we may be getting in touch sooner than you think

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,600
with our new series called 'Ask America'.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,300
But who are we?

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,280
We are BBC News journalists filming stories all across the country

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,320
like this one about the many
jobs a teacher in Oklahoma has to work

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,680
to make ends meet.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,520
Yes, I knew what I was
getting into.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,740
Did I think I wasn't going to receive a raise in 10 years?

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,700
Absolutely not.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,999
Or this one in Stockton about a Stanford
grad who moved back to save his hometown.

15
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:44,920
Sometimes I pinch myself like 'yo, you're the mayor.'

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,890
Especially comes like problem solving

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,180
or like 'why don't why aren't we doing this
or why don't they do that?'

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,660
And it's like 'why aren't you doing it? You're the mayor.'

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,140
And we publish these videos in all if your favourite places

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,720
and formats!

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,380
The good news
is were interested in all kinds of topics like...

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,480
immigration

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,300
education

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,200
healthcare

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,340
and sports!

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,520
But we'd love to hear from you if

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,530
there's something happening in your neck
of the woods that you think would be

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,220
interesting to the BBC's global audience

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,580
We'll be out and about in the coming
weeks to highlight your story ideas and

30
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,160
answer your questions.

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,262

Ask America.

35
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,629

journalists

36
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,120
