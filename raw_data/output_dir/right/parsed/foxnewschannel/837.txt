>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.
THIS IS CHANGING THE NATION BY
UNDERCUTTING THE MAIN FUNDING
AND SUPPORT OF DEMOCRAT PUBLIC
SECTOR UNION.
AT THE HEART OF THE CASE IS THE
PRACTICE OF THOSE UNIONS
CHARGING FEES THAT DON'T WANT
THE UNION BUT GETTING BENEFITS
FROM THE UNION.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
JOINING ME IS TIM.
HE'S ONE OF THE BIG EXPERTS.
LET ME EXPLAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THIS.
PARTICULARLY HOW MUCH MONEY IS
AT STAKE FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR
UNION.
SOME OF THE NUMBERS I HAVE SEEN
ARE HUGE.
>> YEAH, SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
ROUGHLY 5 MILLION GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
THAT WILL BE EEQUITY
THAT WILL BE EFFUITY
THAT WILL BE EFFECTY
THAT WILL BE EFFECTED BY THE
DECISION.
IN NEW YORK ALONE 1.2 MILLION
EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE STATE OF
NEW YORK.
ROUGHLY 200,000 OF THEM HAVE
ALREADY EXERCISED THEIR RIGHT NO
OPT OUT.
ON THE DAY IT COMES DOWN YOU ARE
LOOKING AT UNIONS ON DAY ONE.
>> WHAT IS THE PLAY AROUND THE
REST OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF
THE DIFFERENT POLITICS ON THE
ISSUE, HOW DOES IT WORKOUT?
>> THE STATE'S POLICIES ARE, YOU
KNOW, DEFINITELY BY STATE.
EVERY STAY HAS THEIR OWN
INDIVIDUAL.
AGAIN, WE ARE LOOKING AT NUMBERS
THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT.
5 MILLION ACROSS JUST OVER 20
STATES AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
5 MILLION EMPLOYEES FROM A HIGH
OF 1.3 IN CALIFORNIA DOWN TOES
ALLOW AS 80,000.
>> HOW LONG HAS THIS BE GOING
THROUGH THE SYSTEM.
WHEN CAN YOU EXPECT THE RULING?
>> THIS CASE WITH WAS HEARD IN
FEBRUARY.
IT'S A CONTINUE
IT'S A CONTINUATION IN A CASE
HEARD IN 2013.
THE RULING WILL BE HEARD IN A
FEW DAYS NOW.
THEY COULD HAND DOWN A DECISION
TOMORROW OR AS LATE AS THE END
OF THEIR SESSION IN 27th OR
28th.
>> WHEN YOU SAY THIS IS A BIG
IMPACT.
THE ORGANIZE IS AT THE PORT.
IN MANY WAYS, IT'S SUCH A COOL
PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
AESOP RATION.
THAT'S WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE
HERE.
HOW THEY ARE REACTING TO THIS
FATAL BLOW, YOU KNOW NOT FATAL
BUT CRIPPLING BLOW.
TOUCH AND TALK ABOUT THE
GOVERNMENT UNIONS AS A MOVEMENT
IN THEMSELVES.
CERTAINLY HERE IN NEW YORK AND
STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE
UNIONS ARE A POLITICAL THING
THAT ARE RECKONED TO BE DEALT
WITH.
THEY ORGANIZE, THEY ARE INVOLVED
IN LOBBYING AND STATEHOUSES IN
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
THEY ARE INVOLVED IN POLITICAL
CAMPAIGNS.
>> YOU KNOW, EVERY DOLLARS THAT
COMES AWAY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT
ON THEIR ABILITY TO ORGANIZE AND
IMPACT POLICY AND ELECTION.
STEVE: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT'S A GREAT SUMMERY OF ALL OF
THAT.
WE'LL WATCH FOR THE RESULTS.
WE THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
>> THANK YOU.
STEVE: JASON, LET'S GO TO YOUR
LIST.
THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS
SO INTERESTING.
I WANT TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE POPULOUS MOVEMENT.
THEY ARE TOO WEAK IN AMERICA.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF ABUSE IN
WORKERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
THE ROLE OF SUB LICK SECTORS IS
INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF
BLOCKING THINGS.
>> THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SUPREME
COURT RULING.
THEY ARE TAKING MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS AND GALVINIZE THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE AND LOBBY TO ELECT
DEMOCRATS.
THESE ARE FEDERAL WORKERS THAT
MANY OF THEM WORK 100% OF THEIR
TIME ON UNION ACTIVITY.
STEVE: IS THAT TRUE?
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
>> THEY WILL TAKE FEDERAL
TAXPAYER DOLLARS, THEY GET
BENEFITS, AND HEALTHCARE AND
WORK ON UNION ACTIVITY.
>> THAT DOESN'T COUNT AS
CAMPAIGNING.
>> WE ARE FUNDING IT.
>> IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST
THINGS OF ALL-TIMES.
THIS IS CORRUPTION AT THE
HIGHEST LEVEL.
THEY ARE WORKING ON BEHALF OF
THE WHOLE MOVEMENT TO GET OUT
THE VOTE.
THEY ARE THERE ON ELECTION DAY.
LITERALLY WHILE ON THE FEDERAL
DIME AND GETTING PAID AND
PUTTING FORWARD THEIR OWN
CANDIDATES.
THEY USE THE POWER TO ALSO
BOYCOTT OTHERS AND CREATE MESS
IN THE AREA AND TOTAL
PANDEMONIUM SO NO ONE CAN GET
BUSINESS DONE AND THEY SHUT YOU
DOWN.
>> WHAT THE SUPREME COURT IS
LOOKING AT IS THERE IS THE UNION
AND YOU DECIDE I DON'T WANT TO
BE IN THE UNION.
YOU TAKE 78% OF THE DUES OUT OF
YOUR CHUCK.
THEY TAKE IT AND POUR IT IN THE
UNION EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
DO IT.
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY PUBLIC
TECH
SECH
SECTOR UNIONS.
THE POINT OF THE UNION.
>> THEY CALL THEMSELVES LABOR.
>> WHY DO YOU NORMALLY HAVE A
UNION IF YOU ARE A FIELD WORKER
OR PIPEFITTERS?
IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE A
CAPITALIST OBJECTION.
THE GOVERNMENT UNION IS THE GUY
WHO NEEDS YOUR VOTE AND
ORGANIZES.
THEY ARE BUYING THEIR OWN
BOSSES.
IT'S UTTERLY CORRUPTION FROM THE
GET GO.
>> THAT'S BRILLIANT.
>> I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE GIVE
INTELLECTUAL BACKUPS.
>> RIGHT.
>> THEY ARE GETTING SMALLER AND
WEAKER.
THEY ARE GETTING ROUGH.
THEY TAKE ALL OF THEIR MONEY AND
NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HELP THEM.
THEY ARE USING THEM AND MAKING
THEM.
IT'S LIKE FORCED LABOR FOR THE
POLITICAL AGENDAS
STEVE: THEY BLOCK REALLY
IMPULSIVE THINGS.
>> IT SEEMS LIKE AN EDUCATION.
>> THEY WILL COUPLE THEMSELVES
LIKE SOMEONE AT PLANNED
PARENTHOOD.
THEY WILL TAKE ALL OF THE
FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND WHAT THEY DO IS THE UNIONS
COME IN AND USE THE PHYSICAL
FACILITIES TO GATHER, ORGANIZE,
AND GET OUT THE VOTE.
REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING AROUND.
