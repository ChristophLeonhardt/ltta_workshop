leading off our discussion now Jill wine banks former assistant Watergate special prosecutor an MSNBC legal analyst and Mimi Roca former federal prosecutor she's now fellow at Pace University Law School and an MSNBC contributor and Jill it was just a quick 44 years ago that Richard Nixon yesterday was handing over those tapes and three days later was gone on the anniversary of that moment of the handing over the tapes we get this exist extraordinary strange tweet from the President and since I've read that since I read that tweet all I've been wondering about is why can you make any sense of the why that treat that tweet would go up I have long since given up trying to figure out why the President does anything because almost none of it makes any sense that was very harmful not just to his son who he was throwing under the bus by admitting the real purpose of the meeting but to him as well because he drafted a fake report about why the meeting happened so now he's admitting to obstruction of justice not just to working with the Russians and you clearly defined what the law is you cannot accept anything and if you tried to get it but failed you've attempted to violate the law and that's just as much a crime as actually taking it if I go into a bank and say give me your money and you refuse I've still tried to rob your bank and I can be tried for a crime so the fact that he didn't succeed or at least says he didn't and as you pointed out we don't know whether he actually got dirt or not we certainly know that there was an announcement that there would be dirt and then there was a leak of the emails so did they know that that's what was going to happen that would be conspiring with the Russian government to hurt the election and that's a crime Mimi Roca we don't know if the president's had help with this tweet we don't know if someone else gave him that fancy big word fabrication instead of the word lie but if he did have have help with this tweet if he had someone a lawyer looking over his shoulder on this tweet can you find any conceivable legal theory that would suggest that this tweet could be somehow helpful I don't think he had a good lawyer helping him if so no I don't see a great legal theory I thought the best I can make of it are two things one that he sees the writing on the wall about his son and that it you know all arrows point to his son is going to likely be charged with something in relation to this meeting and he's trying to engender some kind of sympathy you know poor my poor son who just kind of fell into this because he was trying to help me become president and you know was him I don't know and look there are some people out there are some Trump supporters who may go along with that and feel that and this is part of the witch-hunt without using the word witch-hunt and then of course there's a second part of the tweet of you know I mean what he's done in this tweet is he's after a hundred tweets of no collusion no collusion he now has basically said without using the words in this tweet yes collusion but you know it was my son and I feel bad for him and I didn't know about it so he's trying to distance himself it's just it's a total of what we call false exculpatory what he says about his knowledge and it looks false because it is and so I think you know again if he had a lawyer advising him it was not a good lawyer and Jill the the the idea that this is helpful to the President himself alone saying that this this is a way of saying that the president isn't guilty of anything I still can't think of any reason to to put that in a tweet even if that's what the president believed that he wasn't guilty of anything I think Mimmi hit it on the head which is he's not getting very good legal advice and something she said also reminded me of why for example rosemary woods was never indicted for perjury she testified she erased eighteen and a half minutes and described how she did the erasure and the testimony showed that that did not happen but we didn't indict her because it would have been a distraction I don't think the same is true with Donald Trump jr. Donald Trump jr. played a pivotal role in the campaign and he is not just some assistant to the president who shouldn't be indicted if he did as his email said please give me the dirt I love it especially release it later in the summer when it'll do maximum damage that's an indictable crime and he should be tried for it I mean if Donald Trump jr. solicited this information from Russian Nationals without knowing that that was a crime how does that factor into charging this crime or defending against this charge he doesn't have to know that it's a crime what he has to have a sort of general intent here that he knew you know what he was doing so here he knew he was accepting information whether it be you know actual documents I mean when we talk about dirt as you mentioned it could just be that they told him they were going to do something or that they had access to information and that's why you know Trump made that announcement so he doesn't he does not have to know ignorant of the laws no defense and people are familiar with that there are some crimes where you have to have a more specific intent but I think here it would have to be general knowledge about the conduct that he was doing not the specific law that he was violating and in particular if we're talking about conspiracy law you know he he could be liable for joining a conspiracy that the Russians already had underway when they hacked into the Democratic emails and had them in their possession you can join a conspiracy at any time you don't have to be there from the beginning as long as you're aware of the general object of the conspiracy and you know England join it and then do something in furtherance which again all arrows point to Trump jr. did that Mimi Roca and Jill wine banks thank you both for starting us off tonight really appreciate for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
