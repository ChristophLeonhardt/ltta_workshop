we gotta go soon guys okay let's go so
we gotta go I gotta get home ready for
this event I have no idea what I'm gonna
wear so nervous a rhinoceros save
rhinoceros deal rhinoceros
so I feel like DJing is one of the most
expensive occupations because you have
to have speakers and sound systems
lights
fortunately tonight it's very low-key
all I got to do is bring my little
I don't know if you notice DJ makes me
like nauseous
not not nauseous but anxious it's just a
lot of like on-the-fly thinking you know
what I'm saying and for me I like to be
prepared before I go to work type thing
you just never know who you're gonna be
DJing in front of and what they're gonna
want to hear or if the equipment is
gonna mess up or if the power is gonna
be able to support their equipment you
have so this is a lot of things that can
go wrong and for me you miss one chord
and your whole thing is shut down so
DJing really isn't you know one of the
things that I enjoy the most about what
I do but it's something I'm good at and
I do it strictly for money I don't do it
for any other reason
I charge so much just because
I don't really like to do okay guys I'm
going bye-bye because I gotta go work no
I gotta go to a show I got a DJ I'm
gonna be using this to spin at this
party in line for the phony who didn't
come online they come here you could get
judge could get judge yeah
every guy need to uh fried calamari you
know not the circle joints heated or
ones with the legs don't be stingy

ice on that can i spring in an ankle god
