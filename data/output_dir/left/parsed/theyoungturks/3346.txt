IT'S THE SECOND WEEK OF THE
REPUBLICAN ROLLOUT OF A NEW
TAX PLAN.
AS WE TOLD YOU LAST WEEK, BEFORE
IT WAS REVEALED IT WAS WILDLY
UNPOPULAR.
I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT 32%.
IS EVEN WORSE NOW AND THERE ARE
A FEW REASONS FOR THAT.
PEOPLE CAN SEE THROUGH THE
PROPAGANDA, THEY KNOW THIS IS
LARGELY A GIVEAWAY.
60% OF 
AMERICANS SAID THIS
FAVORS THE WEALTHY.
>>THEY DIDN'T READ IT IS THE
TRUTH OF IT.
>> REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE
SOME OTHER PROBLEMS TO BECAUSE
THEY WERE REALLY HAVING TO
STRETCH THE MEANING OF WORDS.
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE
TERM MIDDLE-CLASS.
YOU SEE THERE IS A BENEFIT FOR
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES.
THEY 
SAY WE KEEP THE HIGHEST ONE
THE SAME, WHICH ISN'T TRUE,
THEY CHANGED HOW MANY PEOPLE
QUALIFY FOR THAT.
THEY DROP DOWN THAT 35 FROM 39,
AND THEY INCLUDE IN THE LOW AND
MIDDLE INCOME CATEGORIES.
THE QUALIFY FOR THAT YOU HAVE TO
MAKE MORE THAN $450,000 WHICH
WOULD PUT YOU IN THE TOP .5% OF
ALL AMERICANS.
THAT IS MONEY WHERE YOU CAN LOOK
DOWN ON THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE
1%, THOSE BROKE BASTARDS.
I 
AM
DESTITUTE BY THOSE STANDARDS.
I CAN AFFORD TO SIT AT THIS
DESK.
>>MOST PEOPLE NEVER SEE $450,000
AS AN ANNUAL INCOME EVER.
YOU HAVE THE STATISTICS.
99.5% WON'T SEE IT.
>> THE DEMOCRATS FINDING THIS,
THEY HAVE TO USE THIS STUFF.
IT IS SORT OF IN OUR DNA IS A
COUNTRY THAT WE ARE
ASPIRATIONAL.
WE'VE CONVINCED OURSELVES THAT
WE HAVE THIS AMERICAN DREAM
AND IF WE WORK HARD AND STUDY
AND SAVE, WE TOO CAN BE WEALTHY.
IT HASN'T BEEN TRUE IN 70
YEARS BUT WE STILL BELIEVE IT
AND THINK IT IS POSSIBLE.
SO YOU CAN GET A LOT OF VAGUE
LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD JUST
SLIDE OVER THE ARMOR OF OUR
AMERICAN DREAM.
YOU CAN CONVINCE A GUY THAT HE
IS MIDDLE-CLASS BUT YOU
CAN'T CONVINCE HIM THAT HE MAKES
$450,000 A YEAR IF HE DOESN'T.
HE KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HIS SALARY AND THAT.
>> WE ARE DISTRACTED BY A LOT OF
THE RUSSIA CONVERSATION AND
THERE IS SOME FRESH MEAT SERVED
UP ALL THE TIME ON THAT.
INDICTMENTS AND MORE RUMORS OF
INDICTMENTS.
IT TAKES US OFF THE TRAIL
BECAUSE THIS SHOULD BE FRONT AND
CENTER.
IT IS A REAL MONEY GRAB.
WE DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT IT,
WE NEED TO DO MORE WITH THIS.
OPPOSITION NEEDS TO PLAY THIS
CARD IN A BIGGER WAY.
>> LAST FRIDAY WE BROKE DOWN THE
LIKELIHOOD THAT THE ENTIRE THING
COULD CRUMBLE BECAUSE OF HOW
AGGRESSIVELY GREEDY THEY ARE
BEING TAUGHT THEIR DESIRE TO NOT
JUST CUT CORPORATE TAXES DOWN BY
FIVE OR 8%, WHICH WOULD BE HUGE
FOR THOSE CORPORATIONS, BUT THE
NEED TO CUT IT EFFECTIVELY AND
HALF MEANS THEY WILL DRIVE
UP THE DEFICIT SO MUCH THAT THEY
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PASS
THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE OF THE
BIRD RULE.
THEY ARE JUST SO BRAZEN.
IS AMAZING WE ARE NOT ONE
MONTH INTO THIS NEW POWER
STRUCTURE WE HAVE OF THE
COUNTRY.
THE INCOMPETENCE MONTH AFTER
MONTH, AND THEY STILL THINK
WE GOT THIS.
IT MIGHT BE THE END FOR THEM.
BUT WE DO STILL HAVE TWO AS YOU
SAY KEEP ON IT BECAUSE IF THIS
PASSES IT IS NOT JUST A DISASTER
NOW, IT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR
THE NEXT FIVE OR 10 YEARS
BECAUSE WHEN YOU START RACKING
ON TRILLIONS MORE DOLLARS IN
DEFICITS PER YEAR, THINK OF
ALL THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT
WILL HAVE TO BE CUT.
THEY WILL BE JUSTIFIABLY CUT TO
BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE.
WE CAN FORGET ABOUT THE
ASPIRATIONAL STUFF, EVEN
KEEPING WHAT WE HAVE NOW WOULD
BE IMPOSSIBLE IN MANY CASES
IF THIS TAX CUT GOES THROUGH.
>> THE FACT THAT IT IS GOING TO
BE A DEFICIT MAKER MAY BE
OUR ONLY HOPE FOR IT NOT
PASSING.
AS JOHN SAYS, THAT AUDLEY MAY BE
THE SAVING GRACE OF THIS BECAUSE
APART FROM THAT, IT IS LIKELY
THEY WILL PUSH IT THROUGH.
THEY DON'T CARE IF IT HAS
POPULAR SUPPORT.
THIS IS A CLEVER CREW.
THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS GOP
LEADERSHIP WHICH IS NOW IN BED
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION â€“ THEY
DON'T NEED TO SELL IT BECAUSE
THEY'VE GOT THEIR CADRE, WHICH
IS JUST THE GOP IN CONGRESS
AND THEY WILL PUSH THROUGH
WHATEVER.
THE MESSAGING THEY WILL LEAVE TO
DONALD TRUMP.
THAT MIDDLE-CLASS MESSAGING, IT
WILL JUST BE SPOONFED TO HIS
FOLLOWERS AND THEY WILL
REGURGITATE IT.
THAT IS WHY THAT HAS TO GET OUT
THERE.
THEY OUT MESSAGE US EVERY STEP
OF THE WAY.
>>BETWEEN US AND THAT AT THE
MIDDLE- 
YOU ARE RIGHT THEY
DON'T CARE THAT IT IS NOT
POPULAR, THEY DON'T EVEN
SEEM TO ACCEPT IT IS NOT
POPULAR.
ONE SET IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
POLLS THAT ONLY TALKS TO 1000 OR
2000 PEOPLE?
