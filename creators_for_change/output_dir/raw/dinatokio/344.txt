00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,250
pair however she proceeded<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell me</font>

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,830
that that wasn't the point anyways

31
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,750
really awkward but she's she's all cool

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,330

35
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,750
having the talk about these kind of

36
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,080
issues pretty soon so watch out for that

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
anyway today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> video is to tell you guys</font>

38
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">these clothing brand I look a little bit</font>

39
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,500
like a chubby bunny but don't worry

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,140
anyway I'm the suits calm they are a

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,079
clothing brand um let me just read you a

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,150
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of info about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them soups SWOTs</font>

43
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,939
stands for the secret order of the

44
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,189
streets<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a</font>

45
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,189
little bit or Masonic vibe but in fact

46
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,840
it's the opposite so facebook.com

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,939
forward slash the suits conscious

48
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,030
swagger for the conscious mind alrighty

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,950
there so the whole point of the brand is

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,229
to not only be a fashionable brand that

51
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,700
designs<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-quality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tees and</font>

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,030
sweatshirts with slick graphics but to

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,030
also use it to rave is awareness this

item with their company's logo on it if

57
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,810
i move back so you can see there's fight

58
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,730
to the power that if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

59
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,989
quick look it's actually quite a clever

60
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,700
little thing they've done hit the

61
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,000
pyramid upside down and right over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,390
is the eye closed so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys know</font>

63
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,310
like the Freemasons logo is usually the

64
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,830
pyramid with the eye<font color="#CCCCCC"> open and the whole</font>

65
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,500

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,640

<font color="#CCCCCC">matter is serious and we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not afraid</font>

83
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,450
to address it however we do keep our

84
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,799
designs slick enough to fit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

85
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,690
anyone with sense of swagger or style

86
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,370
and it is in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed for people</font>

87
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,750
who do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about these issues</font>

88
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,750
normally to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise awareness so</font>

89
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,370

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,319
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just educate someone else very</font>

94
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,930
good point so also ten percent of all

95
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,269
the profits<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to Palestine completely</font>

96
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,310
