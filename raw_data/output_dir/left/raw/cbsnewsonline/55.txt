377
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,085

AS DISTRESSING AS THIS DAMAGE IS

389
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,507

IF NOT, WAIT UNTIL THE VEHICLE

648
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,163

00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:02,033
WATER AND OPEN THE DOOR TO EXIT.

650
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,970

00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,920
ENCLOSED SPACES FOR THREAT OF

748
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,487
CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING.

749
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,623
AND LASTLY RELATED TO FOOD THROW

750
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,859
AWAY ANY FOOD THAT MAY HAVE COME

751
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:54,065
IN CONTACTED WITH FLOOD WATERS

752
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,635
OR NOT BEEN REFRIGERATED

753
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:58,203
PROPERLY.

754
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,272
THANKS AGAIN AND BE SAFE.

755
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,106
>> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.

756
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,441
SO FOLKS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

757
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,710
FOR ME TO GET OUT OF D.C. BE ON

758
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,512
THE GROUND AND MAKE SURE WE'RE

759
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,847
GIVING THE GOOD GOVERNOR, MIKE

760
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,584
AND HIS TEAM EVERYTHING WE CAN

761
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,451
TO HELP NORTH CAROLINA OVERCOME

762
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,353
THIS HIT AS WELL AS SOUTH

763
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:15,786
CAROLINA AND OTHERS.

764
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:16,688
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH WHERE WE

765
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,456
ARE BUT I KNOW WE HAVE A LONG

766
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,658
WAY TO GO BECAUSE THIS EVENT IS

767
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:20,925
NOT OVER.

768
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,195
I THINK THE NEXT 48 HOURS WILL

769
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:24,729
BE INCREDIBLY CRITICAL.

770
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,098
WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE

771
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:33,004
CAN TO HELP THE GOVERNOR AND HIS

772
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:33,204
TEAM.

773
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,073
WE REALIZE WE HAVE A LOT OF

774
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,241
PEOPLE OUT THERE IN SHELTERS AND

775
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,509
WE REALIZE THERE WAS A LOT OF

776
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:39,110
DISPLACED FOLKS.

777
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,012
SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN

778
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,915
TO MAKE LIFE A LITTLE BIT BETTER

779
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,850
EACH AND EVERYDAY AS PROGRESS IS

780
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,184
MADE.

781
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,253
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR

782
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:52,323
THE WATER TO RECEDE AS THE

783
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,158
GOVERNOR WAS PUSHING FORWARD

784
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,027
SOME OF THESE RIVERS HAVEN'T

785
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,228
CRESTED YET WHICH IS INCREDIBLY

786
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,563
FRUSTRATING NOT ONLY TO YOU

787
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,866
WANTING TO GO HOME BUT TO OUR

788
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:07,772
PARTNERS WHO WANT TO GET IN AND

789
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,272
FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

790
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,508
AS THE WATER RECEDES AND THE

791
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,709
SAFETY, SEARCH, AND RESCUE

792
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,779
MISSION COMES TO AN END WE'LL BE

793
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,880
FOCUSSING ON OTHER CRITICAL

794
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,117
LIFELINES SUCH AS FIXING THE

795
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:19,717
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, HELPING

796
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:20,818
MR. TROGDAN DO THAT.

797
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:23,488
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET THE ROADS

798
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,291
BACK OPEN TO FULLY GET THE POWER

799
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,859
BACK ON SO PRIVATE INDUSTRY CAN

800
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,827
GET THE POWER ON.

801
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,030
IF WE GET THE POWER ON WE SOLVE

802
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,531
95% OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

803
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,132
PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE.

804
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,568
WE ALSO KNOW WE'LL BE DEALING

805
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,504
WITH A LOT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE,

806
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,172
AGRICULTURAL ISSUES, ALL KINDS

807
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:41,873
OF THINGS.

808
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,642
SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH DOWN

809
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,278
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO

810
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,048
OVERCOME AND ALLEVIATE AND

811
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:50,815
STABILIZE THOSE CRITICAL

812
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:51,348
INFRASTRUCTURE LIFELINES.

813
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,851
WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING CARE OF

814
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,286
PEOPLE THAT'S PRIORITY NUMBER

815
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:55,452
ONE.

816
00:30:55,452 --> 00:31:03,627
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS THE

817
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:04,127
GOVERNOR PUT FORWARD

818
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:05,196

DIGITALLY AS YOU CAN.

823
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,713
NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE POWER ON,

824
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,382
NOT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO

825
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,817
COMPUTER CAPABILITIES.

826
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,885

A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS TOO

FEMA WE REALIZE THIS IS GOING TO

833
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,200
BE A BIG RECOVERY MISSION AND

834
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,734

836
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,170
OUR DISASTER ASSISTANCE TEAMS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE

RECOVERY.

850
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:08,826
THE OTHER MAJOR RECOVERY FEMA

851
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:12,397
RUNS IS THE NATIONAL FLOOD

852
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:12,797
INSURANCE PROGRAM.

853
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,966
IF YOU'RE A POLICYHOLDER CALL

00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,901
YOUR LOCAL INSURANCE AGENT.

855
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,804
WE'LL ALSO BE PUSHING OUT

00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,706
SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS AND

857
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,407

00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,648
COOPER, YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE

863
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,083
DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB AND IF I

864
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,284
COULD MODEL THIS STATE AND TAKE

865
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:38,990
IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY I WOULD DO

866
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,156
IT.

867
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:39,791
SO THANK YOU.

868
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,126

869
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,796

871
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,767
WHO ARE HELPING US HERE ON THE

872
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:50,935
GROUND AT THE EMERGENCY

873
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,335
OPERATIONS CENTER.

874
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:57,075
QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF US UP ON

875
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:57,975
THE STAGE?

876
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:00,078
>> THERE ARE DOZENS MAYBE A

877
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:00,812
COUPLE HUNDRED AMBULANCES

878
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,647
SITTING IN GARNER DOESN'T LOOK

879
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,780
LIKE THEY HAVE DONE ANYTHING

880
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,182
YET.

881
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,415
IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

882
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:07,852
NEEDED, DID WE JUST HAVE TOO

883
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,754
MUCH, WERE THEY STAGED IN THE

884
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,924
WRONG PLACE, IF SOMEONE CAN

885
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,791
SPEAK TO THAT?

886
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,095
>> I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF US

887
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,797
CAN VERIFY RIGHT NOW WHOSE

888
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,998
AMBULANCES THEY ARE.

889
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:21,799
OH THAT I THEIR FEMAS.

890
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,570
THEN THAT'S THE NATIONAL

891
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,571
CONTRACT WE ROLL.

892
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,439
THAT'S A PREPOSITIONED ASSET TO

893
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,173
MAKE SURE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS

894
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:31,942
THERE'S LARGE SCALE EVACUATIONS

895
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:33,778
OF HOSPITALS OR ASSISTED LIVING

896
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,580
FACILITIES WE MOBILIZE A MASSIVE

897
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,049
AMOUNT OF AMBULANCES INTO THE

898
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,149
STATE TO SUPPORT THAT MISSION.

899
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:41,185
LUCKILY WE'RE NOT HAVING TO USE

900
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,086
THEM AT THIS POINT.

901
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:42,853
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND STUFF

902
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:44,922
THAT'S STAGE AND HAD READY TO GO

903
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,858
BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW HOW BAD

904
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,892
THESE THINGS WILL BE.

905
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,628
AND IT'S A GUESSING GAME UNTIL

906
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:56,134
FLORENCE FULLY EXITS THE AREA.

907
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,169
GOOD QUESTION, THANK YOU.

908
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,203
>> GARY ROBERTSON, AP.

00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,272
ABOUT SOME WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

910
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,640
ISSUES COULD YOU TALK ABOUT

911
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,142
EVALUATIONS OF DAMS HOW THAT'S

912
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,444
GOING NO TERMS OF GETTING AN

913
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,045
UPDATE ON THAT.

914
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,715
AND ALSO ON WASTE WATER

915
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,114
TREATMENT PLANTS.

916
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:16,521
HAVE THERE BEEN, HOW WOULD YOU

917
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,222
DESCRIBE FAILURES OF THOSE

918
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,956
SYSTEMS AND WHAT KIND OF DANGERS

919
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:20,690
MAY THEY HAVE TO PEOPLE?

920
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,226
>> THE DAMS APPEAR TO BE HOLDING

921
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,464
AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH

922
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,100
DEQ TO HAVE A FLY OVER OF DAMS

923
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,170
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE BEING

924
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,505
LOOKED AT AND ANALYZED AND WHAT

925
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,206
THE WATER LEVELS LOOK LIKE.

926
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,241
SO WE DON'T SEE ANY ISSUES OF

927
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:37,440
THAT.

928
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,511
WE DID HAVE A SMALL DAM FAILURE

929
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,946
THIS WEEK IN BRUNSWICK COUNTY.

930
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,147
BUT THEE WERE NO HOUSEHOLDS IN

931
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,982
THE INUNDATION MAP AND WHAT WAS

932
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:49,286
THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION.

933
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:50,987
WATCHING THAT VERY CAREFULLY, WE

934
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:54,559
HAVE A WATER SYSTEM FAILURE IN

935
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:54,992
SOUTH PORT.

936
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,129
BUT WE HAVE PARTS ON THE WAY.

937
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,031
WE THINK THAT WILL BE MITIGATED

938
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:00,264
SHORTLY.

939
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,899
WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT OTHER WATER

940
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,068
SYSTEMS AS THE RIVERS BEGIN TO

941
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,069
CREST.

942
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,070
SO EVERYBODY IS WATCHING THAT

943
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,071
CLOSELY AS WELL.

944
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:10,074
WE HAVE SOME EQUIPMENT ON

945
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,676
STANDBY BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WHEN

946
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,578
YOU HAVE A WATER SYSTEM FAIL

947
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,679
TOTALLY THAT'S A BIG ISSUE.

948
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,181
SO WE'RE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY

949
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,083
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD ANY

950
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:19,650
SIGNIFICANT WATER SYSTEMS

951
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,785
TOTALLY FAIL YET.

952
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,254
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I DO KNOW

953
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,224
THAT JONES COUNTY WAS HAVING

954
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:30,795
SOME ISSUES BUT CRAVEN COUNTY

955
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,063
HAD INTERCONNECTS WITH JONES.

956
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,065
SO THEY TURNED ON THOSE

957
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,133
INTERCONNECTS AND MAINTAINED THE

958
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,565
WATER SYSTEMS.

959
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:41,805
SO THINGS ARE WORKING BACK UP.

960
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,039
PLANTS ARE WORKING.

961
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:43,674
NO MAJOR ISSUES.

962
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,942
>> AMY ELLIOT, WITH SPECTRUM

963
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:45,142
NEWS.

964
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:47,445
I KNOW A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO WE

965
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,646
WERE HEARING ABOUT SEVERAL

966
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,547
HUNDRED COMPLAINTS ABOUT PRICE

967
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:49,780
GOUGING.

968
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,282
DO WE HAVE AN UPDATE TO THAT

969
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,984
NUMBER AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN

970
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,251
PARTICULAR PEOPLE NEED TO BE

971
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:55,385
AWARE OF IF SO?

972
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:57,989
>> I DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE TO THE

973
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,222
NUMBER.

974
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:10,901
YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN GO TO

975
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:12,637
8775-NO SCAM TO REPORT PRICE

976
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,171
GOUGING.

977
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,974
OUR COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE HAS

978
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:17,475
REALLY HELPED OUT.

979
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,010
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL

980
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,478
BUSINESSES HAVE PITCHED IN TO

981
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,479
HELP.

982
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,147
SO MOST OF THE BUSINESS

983
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,483
COMMUNITY IS DOING GREAT WORK

984
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:25,750
RIGHT NOW.

985
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,885
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU'LL

986
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,688
HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL VIOLENT

987
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,355
THE PRICE GOUGING LAW.

988
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,557
WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO REPORT

989
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:33,991
THEM.

990
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:37,328
I KNOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS

991
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:46,037
INVESTIGATING SOME OF THEM, GAS

992
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:46,437
PRICES BEING ONE.

993
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:52,410
>> WANTED TO JUST GET A LITTLE

994
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,277
BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE MEDICAL

995
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:53,544
SHELTERS.

996
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,047
HOW MANY FOLKS DO YOU HAVE THERE

997
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,183
AND YOU MENTIONED TO ME EARLIER

998
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,851
THIS WEEKEND, DR. COHEN, THAT

999
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,920
PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE A FIFTH

1000
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,287
SHELTER OPENED.

1001
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:03,887
WHAT'S THE STATUS THERE?

1002
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:04,855
>> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.

1003
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,891
WE HAVE FOUR SHELTERS OPEN RIGHT

1004
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,592
NOW AND HAVE A LOT OF BED

1005
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:08,925
AVAILABILITY.

1006
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:10,795
SO RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT BELIEVE

1007
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,862
WE HAVE A 50 SHELTER.

1008
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,265
I CAN GET YOU THOSE EXACT

1009
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:14,498
NUMBERS.

1010
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,835
BUT WE'RE SEEING ABOUT 75%

1011
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,103
OCCUPANCY IN EACH OF THOSE.

1012
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:19,403
THANK YOU.

1013
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,472
>> I KNOW WE'RE STILL IN

1014
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,674
RECOVERY MODE.

1015
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,876
BUT I'M SURE ALSO SOME THOUGHTS

1016
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:26,944
HAVE SPUN FORWARD TO REBUILDING.

1017
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:31,515
AND I WONDER MR. LONG, WITH YOU

1018
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,851
HERE, WHAT ARE WE OR CAN WE DO

1019
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,085
DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME GIVEN THAT

1020
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,453
WE HAVE HAD MATTHEW AND FLOYD.

1021
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:37,955
IS THERE ANY THINKING LONG TERM

1022
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,624
IN HOW WE REACT TO THESE STORMS

1023
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:42,359
AND HOW AND WHERE WE REBUILD?

1024
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,361
>> WE WANT TO BE SMARTER.

1025
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:47,465
WE WANT TO PLAN THIS IN A WAY

1026
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,835
THAT WE GET PEOPLE BACK INTO

1027
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,803
HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

1028
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,739
THIS STORM HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT

1029
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,607
ON THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE

1030
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,175
HOUSING THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

1031
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,211
NORTH CAROLINA AND ALL ACROSS

1032
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,179
OUR STATE FOR THAT MATTER.

1033
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,048
WE WERE TALKING TO ADMINISTRATOR

1034
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,783
LONG THIS MORNING ABOUT A NUMBER

1035
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,885
OF OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE THAT

1036
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:08,818
COULD SPEED UP THIS PROCESS.

1037
00:38:08,818 --> 00:38:12,590
AND I MIGHT LET HIM SAY A WORD

1038
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,757
OR TWO ABOUT THAT.

1039
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,693
>> WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN HAVING

1040
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,428
CONVERSATIONS AND THE GOVERNOR

1041
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,297
HAS BEEN EXPRESSING HIS IDEAS ON

1042
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,231
OUTCOME DRIVEN RECOVERY THAT WE

1043
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,766
HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR AND ONE OF

1044
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,868
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

1045
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,536
WITH IN RECOVERY IS THAT

1046
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,671
RECOVERY IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX

1047
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,139
WHEN IT COMES DOWN FROM THE

1048
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:28,572
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

1049
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,808
WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE

1050
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,811
CAN TO CUT THROUGH THAT

1051
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,079
COMPLEXITY SUCH AS EXPEDITING

1052
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,616
MONEY OUT INTO THE FIELD TO FIX

1053
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,483
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SEVERAL

1054
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:39,716
THINGS.

1055
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:40,418
WE ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES,

1056
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,986
THERE'S A LOT OF TOOLS IN THE

1057
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:42,219
TOOLBOX.

1058
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,456
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AND SIT

1059
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,223
DOWN AND WE'LL BE PREPLANNING

1060
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,090
MOVING FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNOR

1061
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,493
AND HIS STAFF ON WHAT ARE THE

1062
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,528
OUTCOMES THAT YOU WANT TO

1063
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:50,761
ACHIEVE.

1064
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:55,399
I'M A BIG FAN OF DOING IT RIGHT.

1065
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,234
LET'S DON'T REBUILD TO THE

1066
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:03,774
PREDISASTER STANDARD TO SEE IT

1067
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,575
BLOWING OUT AGAIN.

1068
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:05,910
WE'RE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD AND

1069
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,178
HELP THE GOVERNOR MAKE SURE THAT

1070
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,881
WE GET OVER THIS AND DO IT

1071
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:11,081
RIGHT.

1072
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:14,585
>> AND NOT ONLY HOUSING BUT OUR

1073
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,120
INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, OUR

1074
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,021
BRIDGES, OUR WATER SYSTEMS.

1075
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:22,793
WE WANT TO TRY TO PULL IN AS

1076
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,295
MANY FEDERAL RESOURCES AS WE

1077
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:24,628
POSSIBLY CAN.

1078
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,530
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MEMBERS

1079
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,065
OF CONGRESS AND MEMBERS OF OUR

1080
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:28,465
STATE LEGISLATURE.

1081
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:30,601
THIS IS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE

1082
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,668
REBUILDING PROJECT.

1083
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,503
WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT.

1084
00:39:33,503 --> 00:39:35,806
>> GOVERNOR, YOU MET WITH

1085
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,339
ADMINISTRATOR LONG TODAY.

1086
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:37,241
IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY

1087
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,076
YOU TOLD HIM OR HIS STAFF THAT

1088
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,911
YOU NEED OR THAT YOU FEEL LIKE

1089
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,414
HAS NOT MET THE EXPECTATIONS OF

1090
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:43,714
THE STATE?

1091
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,051
>> RIGHT NOW FEMA IS GIVING US

1092
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,518
WHAT WE NEED.

1093
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,387
THEY ARE BEGINNING TO GET THEIR

1094
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:56,694
PEOPLE OUT ACROSS THE STATE

1095
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,595
VERY DIFFICULT TO ENTER RIGHT

1096
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:57,862
NOW.

1097
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,497
ADMINISTRATOR LONG AND I ARE

1098
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,165
GOING TO GO DOWN TO WILMINGTON

1099
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:01,365
TODAY.

1100
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,334
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

1101
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,935
TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE.

1102
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,904
THESE NEXT 48 HOURS ARE GOING TO

1103
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,340
BE CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT AS

1104
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,411
THESE RIVERS RISE WE CONTINUE TO

1105
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,211
FOCUS ON SAVING LIVES.

1106
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,782
BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BOTH

1107
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,551
THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND THE

1108
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,118
LONG TERM FUTURE.

1109
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,887
>> LAUREN HARSH WITH THE NEWS

1110
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,220
AND OBSERVER.

1111
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,288
LAST WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP

1112
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,656
ANNOUNCED HE WAS PLANNING TO

1113
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,458
COMING TO NORTH CAROLINA.

1114
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,226
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING HE'S COMING

1115
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,527
TO SOUTH CAROLINA TOMORROW?

1116
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:32,363
IS HE ALSO MAKING HIS WAY TO

1117
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,363
NORTH CAROLINA TOMORROW AND WHEN

1118
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:36,299
HE COMES ARE YOU PLANNING ON

1119
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:37,167
MEETING WITH HIM?

1120
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:40,003
>> THE ANSWER, WE BELIEVE THAT

1121
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:42,206
THERE ARE PLANS FOR HIM TO COME

1122
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:42,473
TOMORROW.

1123
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,742
I KNOW THAT PLANS LIKE THAT ARE

1124
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,076
FLUID AND YES I WOULD MEET WITH

1125
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,177
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

1126
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:55,386
STATES WHEN HE COMES TO NORTH

1127
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:55,653
CAROLINA.

1128
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,486
ALL RIGHT.

1129
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:58,956
211 FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS

1130
00:40:58,956 --> 00:40:59,256
INFORMATION.

1131
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:05,562
THANK YOU TO MONICA McGEE FOR

1132
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:06,396
AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE.

1133
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:09,033
888-892-1162 FOR PEOPLE DEAF AND

1134
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,501
HARD OF HEARING FOR PEOPLE WHO

1135
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:17,307
NEED THAT NONEMERGENCY

1136
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:17,607
INFORMATION.

1137
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:18,075
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1138
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,244
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE

1139
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,913
LATEST ON FLORENCE FROM NORTH

1140
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:23,213
CAROLINA.

1141
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,748
THE GOVERNOR THERE AND OTHER

1142
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,048
OFFICIALS.

1143
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:26,784
26 DEATHS BLAMED ON THE STORM IN

1144
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,517
NORTH CAROLINA.

1145
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,253
STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

1146
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,854
SHELTERS ABOUT 10,000 ACCORDING

1147
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:31,622
TO THE GOVERNOR.

1148
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,357
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT UP SOMETHING

1149
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,224
WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT.

1150
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:37,828
IT WAS THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DONE

1151
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,863
TO AGRICULTURE THERE WAS A LOT

1152
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:41,231
OF PRODUCT IN THE FIELD TOBACCO,

1153
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:43,667
COTTON, ALL OF THAT WOULD BE

1154
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:43,934
DESTROYED.

1155
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,069
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

1156
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,637
IMPLICATIONS AND IMPACT OF THIS

1157
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,005
STORM FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS TO

1158
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,773
COME THAT'S PART OF THE IMPACT

1159
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,177
AND PART OF THE PRICE TAG.

1160
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:53,643
>> FOR SURE.

1161
00:41:53,643 --> 00:41:55,078
WE DID GET AN UPDATE FROM THE

1162
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:57,514
U.S. COAST GUARD ON SOME OF THE

1163
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,283
NUMBERS AND THE RESOURCES THAT

1164
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,086
THEY HAVE APPLIED TO THE

1165
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,955
RECOVERY FROM HURRICANE

1166
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:05,222
FLORENCE.

1167
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,058
THE COAST GUARD HAS RESCUED 426

1168
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:13,864
PEOPLE AND 234 PETS SINCE THE

1169
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,598
HURRICANE NOW STORM BEGAN.

1170
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,967
THERE ARE 26 TEAMS DEPLOYED TO

1171
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,135
THE NORTH CAROLINA REGION.

1172
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,570
COMPRISED OF ABOUT 116 PEOPLE.

1173
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,839
SO THEY ARE STILL IN THE MIDST

1174
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,806
OF DOING THIS SEARCH AND

1175
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:23,073
RECOVERY.

1176
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,143
IN FACT THEY GO ON TO SAY THE

1177
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,111
SEARCH AND RECOVERY MISSION

1178
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,079
REMAINS THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES

1179
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,380
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IMPACTED BY

1180
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:30,881
HURRICANE FLORENCE.

1181
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,650
>> PART OF THE REASON IS THAT

1182
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,952
THOUGH THE STORM IS LONG GONE

1183
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,054
IT'S SORT OF UP THIS WAY NOW

1184
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:37,688
WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.

1185
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,724
THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS ARE THE

1186
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,324
RIVERS AND CREEKS RISING.

1187
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:42,526
SO PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN

1188
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,228
THEIR HOMES AND THE WATER GOT UP

1189
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,063
TO THEIR FRONT DOOR AND THEY

1190
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,799
THINK IT'S OKAY TO GO BACK THEN

1191
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,100
IT'S NOT BECAUSE FLOODING IS

1192
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,302
STILL, YOU'RE STILL AT RISK OF

1193
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:52,569
FLOODING.

1194
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,405
>> YOU MAY HAVE ALSO NOTICED

1195
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,273
WHILE WE WERE LISTENING TO THAT

1196
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,176
UPDATE FROM THE GOVERNOR WE HAD

1197
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:05,115
A SMALL BOX SHOWING THE RIVAL OF

1198
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:05,983
POLAND'S PRESIDENT -- THE

1199
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,551
ARRIVAL OF POLAND'S PRESIDENT AT

1200
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:07,918
THE WHITE HOUSE.

1201
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,086
WE'LL BE CHECKING IN A LITTLE

1202
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,220
BIT LATER TO SEE WHAT THE

1203
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,256
PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULE IS AS HE

1204
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,490
HOSTS THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND.

1205
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,159
BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK

1206
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,927
BREAK AND COME BACK WITH A WHOLE

1207
00:43:16,927 --> 00:00:00,000
LOT
