“... I hope you will listen to many
brave and outspoken supporters
of movements

“A few years ago,
people were saying
that Oscars were so white.
And since then, some real
progress has been made.”
“Mm-hmm. But when we
came out together,
we know some of you
were thinking:
Are the Oscars too black now?”
“From the 1960s to the present,
we have both witnessed and
experienced so many changes.”
“The changes we
are witnessing
are being driven
by the powerful sound
of new voices, of different
voices, of our voices,
joining together in

“If I may be so honored to
have all the female nominees
in every category stand
with me in this room tonight.

We should continue
doing that,
when the world tells us
to make them deeper.”
