>>GOT A SPECIAL GUEST TONIGHT,
OUR MIDNIGHT HERO COMING TO A
LAWN NEAR YOU.
HE'S ON A MISSION TO HELP BY
MOWING LAWNS IN ALL 50 STATES.
IT'S CALLED RAISING MEN LAWN
CARE SERVICE.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
I SAW YOUR STORY ON TWITTER.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MOWING IN
SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA.
>>  BACK A FEW YEARS AGO, I HAD
A ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION WITH
GOD AND I ASKED HIM TO USE ME AS
HIS VESSEL.
IT CAME TO ME THE DAY I STARTED
MOWING HIS LAWN.
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS STRUGGLING
AND I PULLED OVER AND HELPED HIM
OUT.
AT FIRST, MY GOAL WAS TO MOW 40
LAWNS BY THE END OF WINTER.
I REACHED IT SO QUICK, MY GOAL
WENT TO 100.
THAT'S WHEN THE IDEA OF RAISING
MEN LAWN CARE SERVICE CAME
ABOUT, WHERE WE STILL MOW FREE
LAWNS.
WE'LL SHOW THEM THE INFLUENCE OF
GIVING BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITY
WITH A LAWN MOWER.
>>  WHAT YOU DO IS CHALLENGE
THEM TO MOW LAWNS.
AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SHOW UP
SOMEWHERE TO MOW, THEY ACTUALLY
JOIN YOU.
PEOPLE ARE PART OF THIS PROGRAM.
>>  YEAH.
SO WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE
50-YARD CHALLENGE, WHICH IS A
CHALLENGE ISSUED TO KIDS
NATIONWIDE AND WORLDWIDE.
SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A KID
RIGHT HERE IN SHREVEPORT,
LOUISIANA THAT ACCEPTED THE
50-YARD CHALLENGE.
THEY MAKE A SIGN.
WE SEND THEM A T-SHIRT.
ONCE THEY MOW TEN LAWNS, THEY
GET A SHIRT.
AND ONCE THEY REACH 50, WE FLY
TO WHEREVER THEY ARE, DO LAWNS
WITH THEM AND GIVE THEM A
BRAND-NEW LAWN MOWER.
SO KIDS NATIONWIDE ARE TAKING
PART OF IT.
12 KIDS NATIONWIDE HAVE
COMPLETED IT.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE 130-PLUS KIDS
THAT ARE TAKING PART IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
>>  CAN YOU TELL ME QUICKLY HOW
IT MAKES YOU FEEL TO COMPLETE
ONE OF THESE LAWNS FOR THESE
FOLKS?
>>  IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD
BECAUSE I KNOW I'M MAKING A
DIFFERENCE.
WHEN WE CAN COME CUT IT FOR
FREE, THEY CAN USE THOSE FUNDS
FOR MEDICATION AND FOOD AND
OTHER THINGS THEY REALLY NEED.
>>  RODNEY, YOU ARE AN ANGEL.
YOU ARE OUR FIRST-EVER LIVE
