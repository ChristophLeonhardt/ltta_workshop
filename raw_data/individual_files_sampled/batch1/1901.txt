arming teachers in the classroom is a controversial idea being promoted by President Donald Trump to prevent school shootings if you harden the sights you're not gonna have this problem because these guys who lack courage will never go into those schools he says he wants to encourage educators to become comfortable with a gun even offering bonuses for those with firearm skills I want my schools protected just like my banks are protected Trump made the comments on Thursday at another White House listening session following the shootings in parkland Florida that left 17 people dead most of them teenagers since the school shooting fellow students have made their voices heard and brought pressure to bear on Trump and other right-of-center politicians to tighten gun restrictions arming teachers is not what they have in mind that's their plan anyway mark Barden lost his son in 2012 in the Sandy Hook school shooting school teachers have more than enough responsibilities right now than to have to have the awesome responsibilities of lethal force to take a life on Twitter Trump attempted to clarify his position and floated other proposals such as background checks for those buying a gun raising the legal purchasing age to 21 and again suggesting the end of the sale of so-called bump stocks that increase a weapons firepower not all but some of those ideas are at odds with the biggest gun rights group in the United States the National Rifle Association or NRA pushing back against any effort to limit gun ownership the elites don't care not one whit about America's school system for them it's not a safety issue it's a political issue they care more about control and more of it gun owners agree never right to protect ourselves protect our children so if they're properly trained why not be able to use that I think that it would send a message across the nation that we're taking it in addition to our own hands we're fighting back and we will be the first line of defense and while there is support for at least some of Donald Trump's proposals even the most basic limits on gun ownership will require congressional approval an accomplishment that in the past has proved difficult Kimberly hellcat al Jazeera Washington
