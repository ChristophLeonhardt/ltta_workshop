The Guardian has in an exclusive found a series of emails between the staff of the National Resources Conservation Service that's a USDA unit that oversees farmers land conservation what do the emails show mmm not good and they explain a missive from Bianca mobis Clun director of soil health lists terms that should be avoided by staff and those that should replace them now let me pause here to explain what political correctness is in the history behind it so it is not if you find something offensive that is not what political correctness is it's often misused that way it actually has a literal background historical background where it originated from and some people say oh it was the Soviets who did it some say it was the Nazis who did it it was actually both the Soviets and Nazis would send directives to their political operatives saying whether something is factually correct is not important it needs to be politically correct you must use this kind of language when describing in their case the Jews or the pod rooms the famines etc they would say don't call it a famine call it something else and that would be the politically correct term so in this case here we have the Trump administration telling scientists working at these organizations you are not to use the factually correct words you are to use the politically correct words so let's give you the details they explain in the emails climate change is in the avoid category to be replaced by weather extremes instead of climate change adaptation staff are asked to use resilience to weather extremes and you see the Orwellian twist there too it's no longer a problem it's something that shows our resilience resilience to weather extremes well this doesn't as doesn't that sound lovely George Orwell from the grave going I told you I told you yes you did sir then they explained further here the primary cause of human driven climate change is also targeted with the term reduced greenhouse gases I listed in favor of quote built soil organic matter increased nutrient use efficiency meanwhile sequester carbon is ruled out and replaced by quote build soil organic matter now I'm not sure those things are even related but everything is turned into a positive no no we're not we don't have to worry about reducing greenhouse gases we're building soil organic matter and we're increasing nutrient use efficiency you see how that's great this is the definition of political correctness and by the way if you all these years you're a right winger whose claim to that you hate political correctness I'm sure that you're on a rampage about this and I'm sure that you're being honest and calling out the Trump administration right right let me give you more details in case you want them this is Jimmy Bramblett now he's a deputy chief for programs at n-r-c-s and he wrote quote it has become clear one of the previous administration's priorities is not consistent with that of the incoming administration namely that priority is climate change please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch so now he wrote that four days after the inauguration the emails I quoted previously are from February 16th so a little bit about a month after the inauguration so they come in and immediately start changing the words and in the case of Bramblett he's saying now remember he's turned a bunch of scientists he's not saying hey it's just a research project you're working on let's not only investigate climate change but let's also investigate economic kissers whatever it might be right you say no no stop you're looking into it we're not doing climate change any more science I don't care we're going in a politically correct direction Bramblett added that quote prudence should be used when discussing greenhouse gases and said the agency's work on air quality regarding these gases could be discontinued now if you're looking if you're a scientist you're trying to find out hey is this stuff going in the air don't don't look into it we don't want to know the facts were not interested in science hey right-wingers just be proud just say it man say you love political correctness and that's okay or speak out against the Trump administration on this issue say that you don't like science and you don't want them to do science it just proudly declare what you are you don't like facts you don't like science or say how dare they look we know with great certainty that if you did the correct science on it you'll find out that there is no climate change oldest nine out of the last ten years all broke records for the hottest temperature there is but it's a wild coincidence that I'm sure the scientists are gonna prove it own it but here they're not doing that they're just saying stop the science so now let's remember I remember in the context of all the things that the Trump administration did mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from the websites of the White House and the Department of Interior while the EPA scrapped its entire online climate section in April pending a review that will be quote updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership so and you you probably heard those stories before this is a new one regarding this particular agency in there and the emails that prove exactly how they were doing it so when you take it in total it's a total war on science so one person is inside the agency a staffer has a great question he says I would like to know the correct terms I should use instead of climate change and aiming to do with carbon I want to ensure to incorporate correct terminology that the agency has approved to use man you couldn't have written it better back in fascist Germany and communist dictatorial Soviet Union and it's not on Tim laughter I don't know what his position is he's just asking as a bureaucrat what is now the politically correct words to use I know what the correct words are I know what the scientifically correct words are I know what the English words are what are that what's the language you want me to use in order to deceive people he doesn't have that last part but it's obvious it doesn't matter even if you think it's not to deceive now there is politically correct language and it is enforced throughout the Trump administration what do conservatives do all the time whatever they want to do they project onto liberals up there for political correctness don't let him use scientific terms make sure that you stamp that out okay now the last part if you're not convinced yet that they're against science wait till you get a load of this as The Guardian explains Sam Clovis Trump's nomination to be the USDA's chief scientist has labeled climate research junk science let's pause there for one quick second before I get to the best part now if you think that the science is wrong well as a chief scientist the guys achieve signed you will bring in your legendary other scientists the tiny tiny tiny percentage of scientists paid by the fossil fuel industry to come in and go oh no guys you got the science wrong but it's ok I can prove it to you no you're not gonna do any of that because you know it's not true junk science we won't be doing that anymore all your scientists go to take up for your vacation right anyway let's be fair Sam Clovis nominated to be the chief scientist for this group last quote last week it was revealed that Clovis who is not a scientist once ran a blog where he called progressives race traitors and race traitors and like in Barack Obama to a communist the most important part of that said this is the chief scientist who is not a scientist they literally brought in a propaganda guy who made outrageous propaganda claims against Obama and other progressives and they installed them or they want to install them as a chief scientist they're rubbing your face in it including you conservatives they're saying oh I thank you Schmucks keep making those arguments about how no no we're pro science too we're gonna take your clothes not even design this in clear obvious propaganda guy making the chief scientists and we're gonna tell them no political correctness is not an option anymore it is mandatory but k√∂ppen take our arguments for us pretend it's the Liberals doing it now at least you know so if you want to be a conservative on a Republican you want to support Trump have at it Hoss just proudly declare who you are you're in favor of political correctness and don't ever ever complain about anybody else's political correctness again and you're not for science it's okay raise your hand and admit how stupid you are no problem how pride in it tell us out and proud come out of the closet and tell us you don't believe in science god bless just say it because that's what they're doing right here support independent media come join us to the
