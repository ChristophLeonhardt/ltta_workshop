1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,700
BETSY DEVOS HAD A NUMBER OF
SESSIONS WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,180
WERE EITHER VICTIMIZED BY ACTUAL
ASSAULT ON CAMPUS, OR PEOPLE WHO

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,190
SAID THEY WERE ACCUSED OF ñ
PEOPLE WHO WERE VICTIMIZED BY

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,470
BEING ACCUSED OF CAMPUS SEXUAL
ASSAULT.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:18,360
THIS IS ALL PART OF ROLLING BACK
SOME PROTECTIONS THAT WERE

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,609
PUT IN PLACE BY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.

7
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:27,029
EARLIER THIS WEEK, DEVOS ANGERED
ADVOCATES FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL

8
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,590
ASSAULT BY AGREEING TO MEET WITH
MEMBERS OF MEN'S RIGHTS GROUPS,

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,859
WHICH ARGUES THAT MEN ACCUSED OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE TREATED

10
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,690
UNFAIRLY BY COLLEGES UNDER THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S TITLE IX

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,690
GUIDANCE.

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,660
THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR MEN
HAS A HISTORY OF INTIMIDATING

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,041
VICTIMS BY PUBLISHING IDENTITIES
OF WOMEN WHO SAY THEY MADE

14
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,549
SURE THEY SAY MADE FALSE
ACCUSATIONS.

15
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:53,920
THE OTHER GROUP THAT WAS THERE
IS KNOWN AS SAVE, AND THE

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,719
SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER HAS
ACTUALLY LISTED THEM AS A

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,609
MISOGYNISTIC ORGANIZATION, AND
HONESTLY, I WAS REALLY CURIOUS

18
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:05,400
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF INTERACTION
THEY HAD, AND WHAT THEY SHARED

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,760
WITH BETSY DEVOS, AND REFINERY
29 ACTUALLY HAD A REALLY GREAT

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,490
PIECE WHERE THEY PROFILED ONE OF
THE MEN WHO CLAIMS THAT HE'S

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,009
BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT, BY HIS OWN FRAT

22
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:21,430
BROTHERS, AND SO YOU DON'T HEAR
ABOUT SITUATIONS LIKE THAT VERY

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,270
OFTEN, AND HE'S SAYING, I DON'T
ACTUALLY WANT YOU GUYS TO GET

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,430
RID OF TITLE IX, OR THE
PROTECTIONS THAT THE OBAMA

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,619
ADMINISTRATION PUT INTO PLACE,
BUT WHAT HE DOES CALL FOR IS

26
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,039
INCREASING THE BURDEN OF PROOF
THAT UNIVERSITIES NEED TO

27
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,210
HAVE IN ORDER TO FIND SOMEONE
GUILTY.

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,900
NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THE WAY THAT
UNIVERSITIES HANDLE IT IS

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,350
SEPARATE FROM THE WAY THAT
CRIMINAL COURTS HANDLE IT, SO

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,380
THIS IS REALLY OVER WHETHER OR
NOT A STUDENT SHOULD BE

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,369
EXPELLED OR REPRIMANDED, OR
FACE ANY CONSEQUENCE IS FOR

32
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,420
ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT.

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,039
THERE'S A LOT MORE, IT'S VERY
COMPLEX, TWISTY-TURNEY

34
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,020
STORY, I WANT YOU GUYS TO JUMP
IN.

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:08,449
IF BETSY DEVOS SAID, HEY LISTEN,
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO

36
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:14,209
ACCOUNT RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT
ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, OF COURSE,

37
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:20,151
BUT SOME SMALL FRACTION OF CASES
ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS ñ AND I

38
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:24,629
SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS A FACT,
IT IS ABOUT 2 ñ 10% OF

39
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,250
ACCUSATIONS ARE FALSE, ACCORDING
TO THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP STATS ON

40
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,330
IT ñ BUT IT EXISTS, SO LET ME GO
MEET WITH ONE OF THESE GROUPS.

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,290
AND THEN I WOULD PICK THE GROUP
THAT IS THE LEAST CRAZY.

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,870
THEY DON'T EXIST, UNFORTUNATELY.

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,580
I HEAR YOU ON THAT, THAT'S
RIGHT.

44
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,970
SO, I WOULDN'T PICK ONE THAT WAS
ON THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW

45
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,830
CENTER'S LIST OF GROUPS THAT ARE
MISOGYNISTIC.

46
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,810
THE ONE THAT THE NATIONAL
COALITION FOR MEN, I READ A

47
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,980
QUOTE FROM THEIR FOUNDER A FEW
DAYS AGO ON THE SHOW WHEN SHE

48
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,019
WAS CONSIDERING DOING THESE
MEETINGS, HE SAID THE RAY RICE

49
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:09,180
THING, I'M NOT VICTIM BLAMING,
BUT YOU KNOW, SHE AGITATED

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,380
HIM, AND THAT'S WHY HE HIT HER.

51
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
WHAT?

52
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,489
IF YOU SAW THAT TAPE.

53
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,939
HE KNOCKED HER OUT WITH ONE
PUNCH, AND COULDN'T CARE LESS.

54
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,110
WHAT DO YOU MEAN AGITATED HIM?

55
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,019
IT'S CLEAR VICTIM BLAMING.

56
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,829
THESE ARE BAD, BAD GUYS THAT
SHE'S MEETING WITH, IF YOU WANT

57
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:32,330
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND
IDENTIFY THE SCOPE OF THE

58
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,959
PROBLEM, THAT MAKES SENSE, I
WANT GUYS TO BE FALSELY ACCUSED

59
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,069
OF RAPE.

60
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:42,340
BUT THE PEOPLE YOU ARE MEETING
WITH OUR TERRIBLE GUYS.

61
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,050
THE SENSE THAT I GOT FROM THE
WAY THAT THIS ALL WENT DOWN WAS

62
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:53,290
THAT HER ASSUMPTION OF THIS IS
THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS ARE

63
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,980
50%, AND FALSELY ACCUSED ARE
50%, SO LET'S TREATED AS SUCH,

64
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,702
AND I'LL HAVE MY SESSION WITH
THE VICTIMS, AND THOSE WHO WERE

65
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:02,702
FALSELY ACCUSED.

66
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:06,720
THE REALITY IS, NOBODY WANTS
ANYBODY TO BE FALSELY ACCUSED,

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,030
IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND
DEVASTATING FOR EVERYONE, BUT AT

68
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,810
THE SAME TIME YOU WANT TO ENSURE
THAT YOU TACKLE A PROBLEM THAT

69
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,970
CONTINUES TO GROW ON COLLEGE
CAMPUSES, AND THAT IS

70
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,440
ADMINISTRATORS BRUSHING THESE
THINGS UNDER THE RUG, AND

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,370
NOT DEALING WITH THEM.

72
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,860
AND BY THE WAY, UNIVERSITIES ARE
NOT COURTS; THEY ARE NOT

73
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,600
LOOKING FOR CRIMINALITY, OR TO
CONVICT SOMEONE.

74
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,740
THAT'S FOR THE CRIMINAL COURT
SYSTEM TO DECIDE.

75
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,960
WHEN IT COMES TO UNIVERSITIES,
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR

76
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,050
NOT MAKE IT MAKE SENSE TO MOVE
SOMEONE TO A DIFFERENT DORM OR

77
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,350
EXPEL SOMEONE, AND IN THE VAST
MAJORITY OF CASES, ACCORDING TO

78
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,580
THE DATA, THE PERSON ACCUSED OF
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT DOES NOT GET

79
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,180
MOVED TO ANOTHER DORM OR
EXPELLED, THEY MIGHT GET

80
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:56,680
ASKED TO TAKE A COUNSELING
CLASS, BUT THAT'S IT.

81
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,310
THE WASHINGTON POST LOOKED AT
DATA AT OVER 100 UNIVERSITIES,

82
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,440
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT,
VERY OFTEN, OR MORE THAN OFTEN,

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,490
THEY ARE NOT EXPELLED FROM
UNIVERSITIES; VERY OFTEN THEY

84
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,710
ARE TOLD TO TAKE THESE
COUNSELING CLASSES.

85
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,030
BUT YEAH, LIKE, BUT THESE GROUPS
WANT ñ THE MEN'S ACTIVIST GROUPS

86
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,940
ñ IS, THEY WANTED TO BE THE SAME
BURDEN OF PROOF NECESSARY IN

87
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,050
CRIMINAL COURT.

88
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,490
SO, GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE
DOUBT, AND SO THE UNIVERSITIES

89
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,300
ARE ACTUALLY SAYING, THAT MAKES
OUR JOB IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,540
WE CAN'T PROVE THAT.

91
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,330
AND IT'S ALREADY TOUGH TO PROVE
IN CRIMINAL CASES, WHICH WE ALSO

92
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,850
NEED YOU READJUST HOW WE
CONCEPTUALIZE BURDEN OF PROOF

93
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,950
FOR CRIMINAL CASES, BUT BACK TO
YOUR EARLIER POINT, ABOUT THIS

94
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,870
CONVERSATION, YOU CAN'T CENTER
MEN IN A CONVERSATION WHERE MEN

95
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,481
ARE THE PRIMARY PERPETRATORS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS, AND I

96
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,280
THINK ALSO, YOU CAN HAVE
MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,740
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

98
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,370
2 THINGS CAN BE TRUE, THERE CAN
BE FALSE ACCUSATIONS, AND THERE

99
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,480
CAN BE REAL SEXUAL ASSAULT, BUT
TO GO FIRST, AND THEN TO FRAME

100
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,260
THESE VICTIMS AS EQUAL TO OTHER
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT I

101
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,260
THINK IS PROBLEMATIC.

102
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,520
SO, IT IT'S A TOUGH BALANCING
ACT FOR UNIVERSITIES, AND IF I

103
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,960
WAS WORKING FOR THE DEPARTMENT
OF EDUCATION I WOULD THINK,

104
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,480
LOOK, HOW DO I MAKE SURE THAT
UNIVERSITIES DON'T BRUSH

105
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
THIS UNDER THE RUG?

106
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,510
AND THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO,
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR

107
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,460
UNIVERSITY TO GET A BAD NAME,
AND IF THERE'S A LOT OF ASSAULTS

108
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,960
REPORTED AT A UNIVERSITY THEY
GET A BAD NAME, LESS PEOPLE

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,620
APPLY, IT AFFECTS THEIR FUNDING,
ETC.

110
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,880
SO I HAVE TO STOP THAT PROBLEM,
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS SEXUALLY

111
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,140
ASSAULTED ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS,
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT ENORMOUSLY

112
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,930
SERIOUSLY, AND MAKE SURE THAT WE
GET JUSTICE FOR THAT, MAKE SURE

113
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,130
THAT THE VICTIM DOESN'T HAVE TO
FACE THE PERSON WHO DID IT, ETC.

114
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,930
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN THEY GO
TO ACTUALLY ADJUDICATE THE CASE,

115
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,670
I THINK BEYOND A REASONABLE
DOUBT IS TOO TOUGH IN THAT

116
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,880
STANDARD, ALTHOUGH I DON'T AGREE
THAT IT IS TOO TOUGH IN THE

117
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,990
CRIMINAL CONTEXT, I THINK IT'S
THE RIGHT STANDARD, BUT WE

118
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,420
CAN DISAGREE WITH THAT.

119
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,400
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T
WANT THE COLLEGE TO SAY,

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,970
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ANY
EVIDENCE AT ALL THE GUY IS GONE.

121
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,090
NO, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME REAL
STANDARD, AND MAYBE IT'S THE

122
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,310
SAME STANDARD AS A CIVIL CASE,
BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE

123
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,310
EVIDENCE.

124
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,861
BECAUSE, WHEN YOU GO TO A
CRIMINAL TRIAL, YOU ARE

125
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:30,210
TAKING SOMEBODY'S FREEDOM AWAY,
AND ON A CASE LIKE RAPE,

126
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,010
YOU ARE GOING TO GO ON A SEX
OFFENDER CASE, I MEAN THAT

127
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,880
IS AS SERIOUS AS YOU CAN
POSSIBLY GET.

128
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,780
NOW, REMOVING SOMEBODY FROM
COLLEGE, ENDING THEIR COLLEGE

129
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,950
CAREER, IS ALSO SERIOUS, BUT
IT'S NOT TO THE SAME

130
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,610
DEGREE, AND IT'S A BALANCING ACT
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PROTECT

131
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,270
SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS, AND
WE HAVE THE STATS; THE

132
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,432
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
WHO ACCUSE PEOPLE OF SEXUAL

133
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:57,020
ASSAULT, ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND
WE KNOW THAT THROUGH THE

134
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,540
CASES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN
ADJUDICATED, ETC.

135
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,020
SO, IT'S NOT AN EASY BALANCING
ACT, BUT YOU DON'T BALANCE IT

136
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,180
50-50, THAT'S JUST NOT THE
REALITY OF WHAT IS

137
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,180
HAPPENING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

138
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,490
AND WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS,
EVEN AS THEY ARE GIVING THIS

139
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,661
APPEARANCE OF TREATING THINGS AS
IF THEY ARE 50-50, WHICH WE ALL

140
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:19,500
AGREE IS UNFAIR GIVEN THE
STATS, BEHIND THE SCENES THEY

141
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,030
DON'T TREATED AS 50-50.

142
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,390
DEVOS'S TOP CIVIL RIGHTS CHIEF,
CANDACE JACKSON, STIRRED OUTRAGE

143
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,770
WEDNESDAY WHEN HE TOLD THE NEW
YORK TIMES THAT 90% OF

144
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,060
ACCUSATIONS FALL INTO THE
CATEGORY OF, WE WERE BOTH DRUNK,

145
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,250
WE BROKE UP...

146
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:43,139
SHE LATER APOLOGIZED FOR THAT
STATEMENT, BUT, I MEAN, YOU

147
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,480
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE YOU GET
CRITICISM, YOU SAID SOMETHING

148
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,949
THAT YOU HONESTLY BELIEVED, AND
THAT'S A LITTLE TROUBLESOME, SO.

149
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,630
IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE CASES DON'T
EXIST.

150
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,639
WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AT
PENN, WE LITERALLY HAD ONE

151
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,129
OF THOSE CASES, WHERE SOMEBODY
SAID, SINCE MONTHS LATER,

152
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,329
ONE OF THE NIGHT IN OUR
RELATIONSHIP I DIDN'T WANT

153
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:06,680
TO HAVE SEX, BUT WE HAD SEX, AND
HE DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT I'M

154
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,710
GOING TO CALL IT RAPE NOW.

155
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,139
NOW, I DON'T KNOW ALL THE
DETAILS, AND THAT WAS A LONG,

156
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,200
LONG TIME AGO, AND MAYBE SHE HAD
A POINT, BUT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT

157
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,540
LOOKS LIKE, WHOA, SIX MONTHS
LATER, AND THE GUY DIDN'T EVEN

158
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
KNOW IT.

159
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,600
SO IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE CASES
DON'T EXIST, BUT FOR HER TO SAY

160
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,620
THAT 90% OF THE ACCUSATIONS FALL
INTO THAT CATEGORY IS

161
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,350
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT THAT'S THEIR
MINDSET, THAT'S THEIR

162
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,370
PERSPECTIVE, IT'S A LOT OF BS,
THAT A LOT OF THESE SEXUAL

163
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,319
ASSAULT CASES DON'T ACTUALLY
HAPPEN, WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE

164
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:41,639
CANDACE JACKSON IS ACTUALLY A
SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR, BUT

165
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,660
HAVING NO EMPATHY SHE TURNS
AROUND AND SAYS THAT EVERYONE

166
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:52,180
ELSE IS MAKING IT UP, EVEN
THOUGH THE STATS INDICATE

167
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,310
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

168
00:09:53,310 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH 90 ñ
98% OF THE TIME.
