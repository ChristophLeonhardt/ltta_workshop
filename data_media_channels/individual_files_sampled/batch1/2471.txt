I don't wear a toupee it's my hair I swear sometime it's self-deprecating but he he's a terrific memory so he will remember things you joked about 10 years ago and bring them up he's all just a lot of fun and interestingly I've noticed he can talk comfortably to anybody for a guy who's a billionaire he's not an elite he would rather you know sit down and eat with a bunch of cab drivers than a bunch of fortune 500 executives he's a man of simple tastes he likes you know a cheeseburger he likes comfort food like meatloaf he's really a lot of fun to be with he's a regular guy he's got a great sense of humor Nixon he was an introvert and an expert an extroverts business he had trouble talking to anybody small talk was a real problem for him he was great giving a speech to 2,000 people Klump relates I think on a one-on-one basis to people as well as he does you know in a in a crowd or media situation
