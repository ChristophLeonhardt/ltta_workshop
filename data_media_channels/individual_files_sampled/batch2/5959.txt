if the president does pull out of this when you talk consequences the possibility that Iran does ultimately maybe restart its nuclear program when do you foresee that happening next week next month next year what's the timeline well again it really is all dependent on what the Europeans do in their negotiations with Iran so I think the reporter from Tehran was right the Iranians are going to try to exact more financial concessions and more economic activity from the Europeans as a means of enriching themselves and staying in the deal so I'm not sure that Iran is going to immediately break out but if negotiations go south of the Europeans they will and as I said before they are gonna feel more in Boldin's in what they're doing in Syria building out their ballistic missile program because they know that there will be no international consensus to be mustered against that activity two more questions for you senator what do you make of John Kerry back channeling and having some of these conversations around diplomacy around the Iran deal the Democrats didn't like it when Tom cotton did something kind of similar yeah I don't know too much about that I don't think it's super appropriate for former administration officials to be trying to do side diplomacy but I haven't received my firsthand reports of it if that's indeed the case I'd be troubled by it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
