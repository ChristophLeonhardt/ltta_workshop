political convulsions in Italy meet the new prime minister-designate not a political figure but a former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Corelli I must underline that the government will maintain a neutrality a total neutrality with respect to the electoral debate I will not be a candidate for the next elections and I will ask a similar commitment from the members of the government Cotterell II must now come up with a workable list of Ministers but he's unlikely to survive a confidence vote in a parliament stacked against him so the new government will likely become a lame-duck interim government until fresh elections in the autumn on the weekend president sergio mattarella rejected the euro skeptic finance minister proposed by the five star movement northern league coalition dashing their hopes of becoming Europe's first far-right populist government they've been calls for mass protests and the president's impeachment as head of state the latter seems constitutionally unlikely but it's a nasty turn that sets the scene for a potentially ugly standoff we are going to see throughout the next three months is an overarching narrative the people versus the the palace or so the establishment with the head of state for the first time becoming the main target of the entire campaign there's also the economy to worry about it least cost of borrowing is rising with the political uncertainty if the country's sky-high debt were to become unserviceable then real crisis would arrive in the euro zone's third-largest economy add to that a debate that will only grow louder perhaps angrier now about Italy's membership of the eurozone as the nationalist northern League and anti-establishment 5 star movement vie for an even bigger slice of the next electoral pie Carlo cotta le did his best to calm the waters in the past few days tensions have increased on the financial markets you know that the spread has increased but the Italian economy is still growing and the budget remains under control I can assure you that a government run by me will guarantee a prudent handling of our public accounts in Italy political instability is a fact of life so there'll be little surprise about these twists and turns but no less anxiety over the outcome Jonah hull al-jazeera
