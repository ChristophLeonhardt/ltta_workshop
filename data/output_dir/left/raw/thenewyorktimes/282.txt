00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,730
Hi, I’m Ava DuVernay,
the director

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,059
of “A Wrinkle in Time."

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,560
[music]

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,610
So at this point in
“A Wrinkle in Time,"

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,660
this is Meg’s first world.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,860
So she’s just hopped
to her first planet.

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,660
And one of the reasons why I
really wanted to do this movie

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,130
was just the very
image of a girl

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,120
of color traversing
through the universe,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
having these adventures.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,840
In this moment Meg Murry — 
played by my great leading lady

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,100
Storm Reid —

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,620
she’s being asked
to talk to flowers.

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,050
Because everyone knows that
flowers are the best gossipers

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,864
in the universe.

16
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,780
And one of the things
about the design of this

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,738
is I wanted it to feel
like our characters were

18
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:38,880
in a world that was somewhat
real, but somewhat animated.

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,374
So I wanted to make sure
that it wasn’t hyper-real.

20
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,290
We’re not trying to make
everything look real.

21
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,390
We like the fact
that the flowers have

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,090
a bit of a cartoon quality.

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,990
I always wanted to
step inside a cartoon.

24
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,050
So this is basically Meg
stepping inside of it.

25
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,400
Here Mrs. Whatsit — played
by Reese Witherspoon —

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,660
turns into creature Whatsit.

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,740
And this is a big
change from the book.

28
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,760
In the book creature
Whatsit is a centaur —

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,370
half woman, half horse.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,910
What we wanted to do is update
Madeleine L’Engle’s beautiful

31
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,830
work in “A Wrinkle in
Time” — the author —

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,470
and create something that
hadn’t been seen before.

33
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,040
Because we’ve seen
centaurs on screen.

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
So we created this
beautiful leaf-like creature

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,250
who pulls from the environment.

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,640
And creature Whatsit
it now looks like this.

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,900
[music]

38
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,020
And this quote by Mrs. Who — 
played by Mindy Kaling —

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,630
Dang.

40
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,540
And observed by
Oprah Winfrey as Mrs.

41
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,510
Which — is another update
to Madeline L’Engle’s work

42
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,850
to create a new vision
of “A Wrinkle in Time."

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,450
Oh.

44
00:01:44,450 --> 00:00:00,000
Woo-hoo.
