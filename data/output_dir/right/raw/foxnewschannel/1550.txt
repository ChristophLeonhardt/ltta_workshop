INFORMANT WILL BE MADE

00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:02,786
ACCESSIBLE.

3
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:04,220
>> Bret: CATHERINE HERRIDGE IN

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:04,621
WASHINGTON.

5
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:05,255
THANK YOU.

6
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,058
MORE ON THIS WITH THE PANEL.

7
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,626
TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS AS

8
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:11,428
RUSSIA'S GOAL IS TO CREATE CHAOS

9
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,662
DURING THE UPCOMING MIDTERM

10
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:13,063
ELECTIONS.

11
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:15,365
HOW TO PREVENT THAT IS A MAJOR

12
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:16,466
TALKING POINT TONIGHT.

13
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:17,267
FOLLOWING A HIGH-LEVEL BRIEFING

14
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,503
FROM SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP

15
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:21,271
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS.

16
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,839
CORRESPONDENT PETER DOOCY TELLS

17
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,573
US FROM CAPITOL HILL APPARENTLY

18
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:27,110
MANY IN CONGRESS ARE NOT THAT

19
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,510
INTERESTED.

20
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,246
>> IN A ROOM BENEATH THE

21
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:31,281
CAPITAL, THE INTEL CHIEFS WHO

22
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,450
CAME TO DELIVER A CLASSIFIED

23
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,084
BRIEFING ABOUT ELECTION

24
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,685
INTERFERENCE THAT EVERY HOUSE

25
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,287
MEMBER WAS INVITED TO SHARE

26
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,389
THOSE SECRETS WITH A LOT OF

27
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:40,190
EMPTY SEATS.

28
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,061
>> I WOULD SAY WE HAD 40 OR SO

29
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,229
MEMBERS THAT ATTENDED.

30
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,232
>> THAT'S 40 OUT OF 428 MEMBERS

31
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:50,567
SERVING RIGHT NOW.

32
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:54,637
ONE THEORY: CONGRESS DIDN'T WANT

33
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,440
TO COMMUTE AN HOUR EARLY.

34
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,908
HOMELAND SECURITY CHAIRMAN WAS

35
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:01,478
SURPRISED SO MANY LAWMAKERS WHO

36
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,246
TALK ABOUT ELECTION INTERFERENCE

37
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,681
BLEW OFF THE DIRECTOR OF

38
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,250
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, FBI

39
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,052
DIRECTOR, AND DHS SECRETARY.

40
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,854
>> THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE THIS

41
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,489
SUCH A BIG ISSUE AND ASKED FOR

42
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,757
THIS BRIEFING FOR A LONG TIME

43
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:16,059
AND WE FINALLY SCHEDULE IT AND

44
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,660
IT'S CLASSIFIED AND 30 MEMBERS

45
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,261
SHOW UP.

46
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:20,296
>> EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS NOT

47
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:21,264
RETIRING IS UP FOR REELECTION

48
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:22,365
AND THE MIDTERMS BUT NONE ARE

49
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:24,834
KNOWN TO BE IN THE CROSS HAIRS

50
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,435
OF FOREIGN METALLURGIST.

51
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:26,503
>> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO INTEL

52
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,840
THAT THERE IS A PARTICULAR

53
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,441
INTEREST.

54
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:33,843
>> SECRETARY NIELSEN SAID CHINA

55
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,245
AND IRAN ARE CONSIDERED THREATS

56
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,547
TO ELECTION INTEGRITY BUT THAT

57
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:38,882
KIND OF INTERFERENCE THEY ARE

58
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,084
WORRIED ABOUT IN 2018 IS THE

59
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,853
SAME KIND ELECTED IN 2016 WHERE

60
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,721
BALLOTS AREN'T CHANGED BY SOCIAL

61
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:48,658
MEDIA IS MANIPULATED TO CAUSE

62
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:48,958
CHAOS.

63
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,261
>> I THINK WE REMAIN CONCERNED

64
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:51,861
CERTAINLY ON THE FOREIGN

65
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,062
INFLUENCE I'VE HEARD WE HAVE

66
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:53,863
SEEN THAT CONTINUALLY.

67
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,398
>> DETAILS LIKE THAT DID NOT

68
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:56,866
DAZZLE THE DEMOCRATS WHO DID

69
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,200
ATTEND.

70
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,068
>> I DIDN'T HEAR ONE BIT OF

71
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,303
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

72
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:01,070
THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I

73
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,573
COULDN'T HAVE READ IN

74
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:06,376
"USA TODAY" THAT WAS REVEALED.

75
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,045
SO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A LOW

76
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,080
ATTENDANCE, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

77
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,650
>> THIS WAS THE RARE

78
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,084
RUSSIA-RELATED EVENT ON

79
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:15,852
CAPITOL HILL THAT HAPPENED

80
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,053
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, SO IT'S

81
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,055
GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING TO

82
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,490
SEE IF THE HUNDREDS OF LAWMAKERS

83
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,291
WHO DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT THE

84
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,860
CLASSIFIED UPDATE TODAY DECIDED

85
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,762
TO SHOW UP TO THE NEXT RUSSIA

86
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,864
HEARING WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE

87
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,465
ROLLING THE WHOLE TIME.

88
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:29,766
BRET.

89
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,768
>> Bret: PETER, MOMENTS AGO

90
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:33,503
THE HOUSE PASSED LEGISLATION TO

91
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:34,671
EASE BANKING RULES, ESSENTIALLY

92
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,072
A REFORM OF THE DODD-FRANK LAW.

93
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,674
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE BILL

94
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,075
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOW HEADED TO

95
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,343
THE PRESIDENT'S DESK?

96
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:42,278
>> IT'S MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR

97
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,681
SMALLER BANKS IN THIS COUNTRY.

98
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,482
AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH

99
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:48,918
THE DODD-FRANK REGULATIONS, THE

100
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,253
FEDS PUT THE STRICTEST

101
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,255
REGULATIONS ON BANKS THAT WERE

102
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,256
WORTH $50 BILLION OR MORE.

103
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,258
THEY SAID THOSE BANKS ARE TOO

104
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:55,658
BIG TO FAIL.

105
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,461
THEY MUST BE REGULAR.

106
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:03,433
NOW TOO BIG TO FAIL IS BIGGER.

107
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,234
$250 BILLION, FIVE TIMES THAT

108
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,669
SIZE, IS NOW THE "TOO BIG TO

109
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,037
FAIL" THRESHOLD WHICH MEANS THAT

110
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,640
A LOT OF SMALLER BANKS ARE GOING

111
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,442
TO HAVE A LOT FEWER REGULATIONS.

112
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,043
THIS DOES NOT REPEAL DODD-FRANK

113
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:15,411
BUT IT DOES ROLLBACK A LOT OF

114
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,145
IMPORTANT REGULATIONS AND IT IS

115
00:03:16,145 --> 00:00:00,000
THE RARE MEASURE THAT VERY
