35
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:30,789

38
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:37,229
WAS RUSSIAN SPYING, BUT THEY

39

WERE NOT CLOSE TO BEING NEAR

40
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,467
ABLE TO SAY WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF

41
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:46,205

00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:50,909
THEY COULD NOT OPEN A CRIMINAL

46
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,750

THEY KNEW IT WOULD COME OUT.

50
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:03,756

SPYING, BUT WE HAVE MULTILE

FORMER FBI OFFICIALS SAYS THERE

56
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,033
WAS BROAD SURVEILLANCE ON THE

TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

58
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:20,939
IT WASN'T JUST CARTER PAGE.

59
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,274
IT WAS WIRETAPS AND NATIONAL

60
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:25,778
SECURITY LETTERS AND AT LEAST

61
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,479
ONE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SOURCE.

63
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,349
HOW MANY THERE WERE.

64
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,318
WERE THEY SENT IN BY THE FBI?

65
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:35,354
IT'S NOT A QUESTION THAT THIS

66
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:38,891
MIGHT INDICATE THERE IS SPYING,

67
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,594
THEY SAID THEY SPIED IN A BROAD

68
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:42,928
FASHION.

69
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:43,996

70
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:50,903
WAS RIDICULED WHEN HE SAID I WAS

71
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:51,303
WIRETAPPED.

72
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:52,137
HE WAS RIGHT.

73
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:56,542
>> HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

74
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:59,077
THIS HAS TO BE SEEN IN CONTENT.

75
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:01,814
NOT ONLY DID THEY USE A PHONEY,

76
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,150
FABRICATED DOSSIER AS THE

77
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,151
UNDER-LYING LEGAL RATIONALE FOR

78
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:07,853
THE SPYING ON THE REPUBLICAN

79
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,455
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.

80
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,756
USING THE POWER AND THE

81
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:14,159
AUTHORITY AND THE CAPABILITY OF

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,428
THE STATE TO SPY ON A

83
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:19,264
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BUT THEY

84
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:21,733
INFILLERATED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

85
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,802
WITH AN FBI AGENT.

86
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,872
THIS MAKES WATERGATE LOOK LIKE

87
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,207
SMALL POTATOES.

88
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,908
>> Laura: IT LOOKS LIKE THIS GUY

89
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:33,378
WHO TEACHES AT CAMBRIDGE AND AN

90
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:34,046
AMERICAN CITIZEN.

91
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,113
YOU KNOW HIM, ROGER?

92
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:40,719
>> I PLAYED POKER WITH HIM.

93
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,455
HE IS EXCELLENT.

94
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,790
>> Laura: APPARENTLY.

95
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,193
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEONE WHO

96
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:50,295
SUGGESTED A LOT OF THINGS TO THE

97
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:51,029
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

98
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:54,233
HE DIDN'T WORK FOR THE TRUMP

99
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:54,600
CAMPAIGN.

100
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,235
IT WAS REPORTED THAT HE

101
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,036
APPROACHED MANY DIFFERENT TRUMP

102
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,271
CAMPAIGN PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM

103
00:03:59,271 --> 00:03:59,972
INFORMATION.

104
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,341
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

105
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,477
>> WELL, YOU WOULD CALL A

106
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:08,881
POTENTIAL ENTRAPMENT.

107
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,719
I HAD NOT HEARD THAT YET.

108
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,821
IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME.

109
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,423
IT'S SHOCKEY ENOUGH BASED ON THE

110
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:21,392
FLIMSY EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD,

111
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,028
THEY WOULD PUT SOMEONE IN THE

112
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:23,395
CAMPAIGN.

113
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:24,897
THE FISA IS DISTURBING ENOUGH.

114
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,200
WE KNOW THEY DIDN'T REVEAL

115
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,034
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO THE

116
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:29,501
FISA COURT.

117
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,604
TO HAVE A PLANT IN THE POLITICAL

118
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:34,039
CAMPAIGN OF YOUR OPPONENT.

119
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,474
IF YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

120
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,009
YOU BETTER HAVE DYNAMITE AND

121
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,210
THEY DIDN'T HAVE DYNAMITE.

122
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,712
IT'S PART OF A PATTERN.

123
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:44,149
THE PATTERN OF SALLY YATES

124
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,552
INVESTIGATING MIKE FLYNN AND

125
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,155
PART OF A DISTURBING THING.

126
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:51,657
>> THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL

127
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,024
PROBLEM.

128
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:54,126
CONGRESS IS TRYING TO FIND OUT

129
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,093
INFORMATION ABOUT THESE THINGS.

130
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,729
THE FBI IS TELLING THEM THEY

131
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:58,764
CAN'T TURN OVER THAT

132
00:04:58,764 --> 00:04:59,264
INFORMATION.

133
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,434
AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE SEEING

134
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:03,802
LEAKS WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION

135
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,337
ABOUT THE SOURCE THAT WAS USED.

136
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,372
THEY ARE TELLING THE "NEW YORK

137
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,106
TIMES" AND THE "WASHINGTON

138
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,676
POST," BUT THEY WON'T TURN OVER

139
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:13,579
THE INFORMATION TO CONGRESS.

140
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,613

141
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,115
MAKE THEMSELVES LOOK AS GOOD AS

142
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:18,417
POSSIBLE BEFORE OTHER DOCUMENTS

143
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,184
COME OUT.

144
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,453
THIS NARRATIVE IS TAINTED.

145
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:24,656
BURYING THE LEAD IN THE "NEW

147
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,428
ROGER, RUDY SAID THEY ARE DID

148
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:30,629
YOU SAYING WITH MUELLER

150
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:32,464
QUESTIONS.

151
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,266
I DON'T LIKE HIM TALKING TO BOB

152
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,468
MUELLER AT ALL.

153
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,837
I THINK THIS WHOLE THING STINKS

154
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,872
TO HIGH EVEN.

155
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:42,040
-- HEAVEN.

156
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,577
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE

157
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:45,944
PROGRESS.

158
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:46,979

GO IN FOR AN INTERVIEW.

161
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,284
IT'S A PERJURY TRAP.

162
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,119
THE IDEA THAT ROB ROSENSTEIN AND

163
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,554
JEFF SESSIONS WON'T TURN OVER TO

164
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:58,423

168
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,031
THAT'S AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.

00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:06,358
QUESTIONING.

193
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:09,261
ON THE POINT THAT ROGER RAISED

194
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,696
ABOUT THE INFORMATION THAT THE

195
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,364
DOJ DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE OVER.

196
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,933
THERE ARE GOOD RENS FOR NOT

197
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,635
GIVING OVER SOURCES OF AND

198
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:17,903
METHODS.

199
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:20,872
THE PROBLEM WITH THE DOJ AND THE

200
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,974
FBI, THEY WERE CAUGHT SAYING

201
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,776
SEVERAL TIMES, WE CAN'T TURN

202
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:28,080
THIS OVER BECAUSE IT'S

203
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,447
SENSITIVE.

204
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:33,318
WHEN THEY BACK DOWN AND UNREDACT

205
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,487
IT, IT'S EMBARRASSING.

206
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:39,391
THEY HAVE A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM.

207
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,225
>> Laura: THEY SAID PAPADOPOULOS

208
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,061
WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THE

209
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:43,495
INVESTIGATION.

210
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:45,130
HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOFBALL.

211
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,698
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

212
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,033
LIKE CARTER PAGE AND

213
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,968
PAPADOPOULOS.

214
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,169
THIS IS LIKE RIDICULOUS!

215
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,638
THEY ARE NOT CHARACTERS YOU

216
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,774
WOULD IMAGINE COMPILING

217
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:56,174
INFORMATION.

218
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:57,843
NEVERTHELESS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT

219
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:58,577
THEM.

220
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,279
WHO IS APPROACHING HIM AT THE

221
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,580
TIME.

222
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,448
>> RIGHT, AT FIRST WE WERE TOLD

223
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:04,316
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT

224
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,117
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE WITH THE

225
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,485
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

226
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,020
THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT WHAT LED

227
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,356
THEM TO THINK THAT, IT BOGGLES

228
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:12,557
THE MIND THAT PROFESSIONALS

229
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:13,859
WOULD HAVE STARTED ANY

230
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:18,430
INVESTIGATION AT ALL OVER THESE

231
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,499
VERY PIDDLING THINGS.

232
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,835
THEY WERE SPYING ON AT LEAST 4

233
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:27,339
TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS AND

234
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,206
USING POWERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE

235
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:30,509
COMMITTEE TO DO THIS.

236
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,777
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK

237
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,111
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, IT'S A

238
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,914
HORRIBLE PRECEDENT TO SPY ON

239
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:37,515
PRESIDENTIAL OPPONENTS.

240
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,351
>> Laura: THEY SPIED ON YOU?

241
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,852
>> THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED

242
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,020
THERE WAS A FISA WARRANT ON ME.

243
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,791
I TALKED TO THOSE REPORTERS.

244
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,360
THEY WON'T RETRACT THEIR STORY.

245
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,628
I ASKED FOR INFORMATION.

246
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:50,529
IT WAS DENIED.

247
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,597
>> Laura: I AM NOT SAYING THIS

248
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,599
AS A REPUBLICAN OR CONSERVATIVE,

249
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,169
I FIND IT FRIGHTENING THAT THE 4

250
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,170
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD

251
00:08:58,170 --> 00:00:00,000
BE USEED IN IN MANNER IN THE
