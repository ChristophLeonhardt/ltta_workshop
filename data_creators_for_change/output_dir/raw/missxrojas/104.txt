00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so if you follow football</font>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,600
news as I do you've probably seen the

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,670
story about Liverpool's owners Fenway

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,560
Sports Group<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to raise the ticket</font>

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,330
prices and then facing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pushback</font>

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,010
from Liverpool fans and having to

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,660
reverse the decision to raise their

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,040
prices the reason I bring this up is

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,389
that some people went to the Fenway

10
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,400
Sports Group website and in the sales

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,380
marketing section there was a line of

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,960
help turning fans into customers that's

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,510
a since been updated to turning

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,449
consumers into fans PR move one hundred

15
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,769
percent but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting for</font>

16
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,599
me when considered in parallel with

17
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,700
what's happening on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and the</font>

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,450
sense of no community fracturing and a

19
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,820
distance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being placed in all</font>

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,579
perceived distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe between many</font>

21
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,469
youtubers and their communities<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,210
mention money a lot as a factor in the

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,800
changing feeling of<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube but I don't</font>

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,149
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's always the case I by no</font>

25
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,800
means think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's universally true</font>

26
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,960
that people who use brand deals or pay

27
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">for things have a bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship with</font>

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,899
their community that's just not true

29
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,149
however the fans<font color="#CCCCCC"> into customers a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

30
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,059
is interesting because it shows a shift

31
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,399
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the role</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audience the</font>

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,809
community whatever you want to call it

33
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,489
is perceived<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be</font>

34
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,960
something that's only external that

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,250
might be something that's only with the

36
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,780
group of youtubers that might be

37
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,570
something very specific and rare but i

38
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,880
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the language that we use to</font>

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe it i'm always coming back to</font>

40
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,150
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's really important</font>

41
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,860
and central to the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my</font>

42
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without a dictionary</font>

43
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,159
definition right in front of me her

44
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,130
customers someone who goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a location</font>

45
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,920
or to a service with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the express purpose</font>

46
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,810
of buying something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only who</font>

47
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,000
has a connection to an individual a team

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,850
or an experience that has a measure of

49
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,860
enthusiasm for it and excitement for it

50
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,000
that it becomes part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their identity</font>

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,950
there are two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and in as</font>

52
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,020
much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i strongly believe that money is</font>

53
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,250
a way in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which we express our values in</font>

54
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,630
a little ways like you know like I shop

55
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,490
at lash and that as an expression of my

56
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,590
valine full sustainably sourced and

57
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,090
produce products I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

58
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">there there is as strongly an alignment</font>

59
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,590
with identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same way that it is</font>

60
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,759
when you call yourself a fan of

61
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,040
something and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you align yourself</font>

62
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,770
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a community or with an experience</font>

63
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,409
or an individual or a team there is a

64
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:07,950
sense

65
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,979
being part of something broader whereas

66
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">with purchasing and being a customer a</font>

67
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,410
lot of it is to do with getting

68
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,390
something in return and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

69
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,019
exchange and it's quite in my mind a

70
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,900
specific thing it's going there for a

71
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,800
specific identifiable reason a fan it's

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,209
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the feeling I don't mean to</font>

73
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:31,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">sound wishy-washy about it you might</font>

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,209
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a lot of words for</font>

75
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,680
something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's about</font>

76
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,319
this nebulous thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know</font>

77
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,420
seeing my friends in LA going to the

78
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,860
wizarding world of harry porter soft

79
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,010
open and just having that buzz and that

80
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,660
feeling that excitement we pop the

81
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,660
fandom it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Supreme Court news</font>

82
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,140
today and having the absolute essential

83
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,630
need to have a westering Supreme Court

84
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,450
episode marathon it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> loving a</font>

85
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,190
book and needing to tell everyone about

86
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,560
it it's about watching your<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite</font>

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,319
youtubers and going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> home pages or</font>

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,209
just being furious and the videos that

89
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,130
pop up in this your subscription box

90
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,110
because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what their</font>

91
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,640
video is and you want to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> their video</font>

92
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
and you're excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it I think</font>

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,569
there's a level of excitement maybe that

94
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,790
comes into it but I I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

95
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,380
always true as well there are things

96
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,910
that I've been excited to buy and I've

97
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,470
been excited to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like you know</font>

98
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,239
when I report how fresh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how I</font>

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">was very excited to buy it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that</font>

100
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,840
excitement wasn't connected to any

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,819
identity of being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer it was</font>

102
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,280
being a fan the customer aspect of it

103
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,489
was very temporary I was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer in</font>

104
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,380
that moment that I purchased the book

105
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,310
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a fan always or a fan in the</font>

106
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,829
time broader than that one interaction

107
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about quantify ability</font>

108
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,560
maybe it's something about an

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,900
information age in which certain metrics

110
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,480
are used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure our success but then</font>

111
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,940
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> our every interaction and trying to</font>

112
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,579
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to compartmentalize it but</font>

113
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,900
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that the language is</font>

114
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,790
interesting and important and I'm

115
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,139
definitely gonna be keeping an eye on

116
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,870
how we describe our communities and our

117
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,840
experiences as time goes on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also how</font>

118
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,250
other people describe their communities

119
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,079
and experiences because it's not to say

120
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,940
that it's one uniform thing different

121
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,049
people are going to use different

122
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,880
identifiers and a different language

123
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,290
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of things when they talk about</font>

124
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,149
their experiences their communities

125
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,459
their environments because everyone's

126
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,200
are living a different life at the same

127
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">time I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a shift</font>

128
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,750
towards tanning fans into customers and

129
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,910
that isn't something that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

130
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,650
necessarily individually responsible for

131
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,240
but it's something we have to be mindful

132
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,510
of as we continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make this community</font>

133
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,250
what we want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I obviously</font>

134
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,080
haven't formed thought is entirely on it

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,310
I'd love to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thoughts and I</font>

136
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,810
would also love to hear any different

137
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,340
parallels and analogies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

138
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,140
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly telling for example</font>

139
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,210
once we've said so far things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like TV</font>

140
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,730
and the music industry and in this case

141
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,100
football but any other parallels I just

142
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,960
be really interested to see because I

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,030
think that they provide a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> into where</font>

144
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,010
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that can offer a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain amount</font>

145
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,950
of clarity and also places<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

146
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,870
doing well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe do</font>

147
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,020
better so that's today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to</font>

148
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,030
finish<font color="#CCCCCC"> this amazing margarita that I</font>

149
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,390
made it's like a grapefruit lime and

150
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,540
obviously tequila margarita mmm so tasty

151
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,280
and it has a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> where more at least it</font>

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,290
did but now that sort room has<font color="#CCCCCC"> king a</font>

153
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,790
little bit sad and to be honest once i

154
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,080
edit this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be watching a few</font>

155
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,820
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> episodes of The West Wing so I will</font>

156
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,320
see you tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i'm gonna make</font>

157
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">a book video tomorrow but who knows</font>

158
