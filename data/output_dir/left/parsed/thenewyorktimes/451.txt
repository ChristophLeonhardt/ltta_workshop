There’s different ways to celebrate moms.
I guess the social construct of Mother’s
Day is this gender role of domestic work,
women’s work traditionally, oh, give Mom a
day off because she does all these
domestic things for the household.
But things are different,
and some families don’t have moms at all,
they have either two dads or
different people who play that
role for them and it’s important
to experience you know different
gender and what that looks like.
My drag name is also my mother’s name so
it kind of hits home for me today.
My mother has come around and supported me
in my adult years, but seeing these young
children, you know, tugging at my dress,
looking at my jewelry, interested in me
Parents, mothers wanting to
take pictures with me,
it would have been really life-changing to
have a role model, celebrating femininity,
not being a traditional woman,
with my mother around.
Happy Mother’s Day, Mom.
You’re the original gangster Ona,
and I hope I’m making you proud.
