according to news reports Democrats are planning to hold seminars for Democrat candidates on how to talk to real Americans I'm not making that up these seminars will attempt to teach Democrats to stop speaking Democrat and start speaking real American in the hopes that they will make democrat policies sound as if they were real American policies and thus cause real Americans to mistake Democrats for real Americans and vote for them as Democrats seminar leader Shea Ivanovich Muhammad told reporters quote if we can't convince real Americans to vote for us then we won't be able to fundamentally transform America into something else and that's on American maybe it's American sometimes I get those two confused unquote the daily wire has managed to obtain or invent a prospective syllabus for the Democrats seminars listing the topics with a brief description of each class among the topics to be discussed will be guns what are they and how can we ban them the syllabus says quote many Americans have come to feel that the Constitution's Second Amendment protection of the right to bear arms should be interpreted as a protection of their right to bear arms when talking to real Americans Democrats should carefully explain how dangerous guns are by showing how every time they are in the hands of Islamic terrorists they go off and kill someone if the real Americans tell Democrats that we should ban Islamic terrorists instead of banning guns Democrats should explain to the real Americans that they are making the Statue of Liberty cry because that's not who we are hopefully this will convince the real Americans to be who we are instead of being real Americans unquote another seminar listed on the Democrats syllabus is the Constitution is it a living document and if so how can we kill it the syllabus says quote many real Americans feel a great affection for the Constitution as a document that insures their freedoms Democrats should carefully explain to real Americans that the Constitution was written so long ago that the paper has become all brown and crinkly and no one can read what it says if real Americans continue to insist on following the Constitution Democrats should explain that it was written by white men who owned slaves and wore wigs sometimes at the same and it would clearly be much more fun to get our laws from screaming women who dress up as vaginas unquote other seminars on how Democrats can talk to real Americans include how to drop your g's and call people folks as if you were some idiot from the Midwest how to break it to people of faith that there is no God and how to convince a patriot his country really stinks seminars will be open to anyone who can present evidence that he's a Democrat and not a real American but I repeat myself trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right I am back from our nation's capital where I was Swan around with the president and the vice president and the king of Jordan was there as well and and me who is the king of my own imagination a lot of royalty was in the room I'm sure I'm incredibly jet-lagged I have to tell you this if I lose some words along the way that's why I came back fairly late last night and I thought to myself you know I really want to go up and watch the Fox panel so I just know what they're talking about before I come in but I hate to fall asleep in front of the television set but I thought I'll just go up and try and watch it so I sit down I instantly fall asleep and I wake up and there's a gigantic ben shapiro face in front of me on Fox last night and I have this huge TV I thought it was a nightmare but I was actually awake but I'm gonna talk about the I'm gonna talk about my experience at the National Prayer Breakfast which was quite quite an experience really got some fresh insights into a lot of stuff but I'm gonna talk about that in a little while so if you're on Facebook or YouTube you will have to come over to the Daily wire.com where you can listen to it or or if you just spend a lousy 8 bucks a month you can subscribe watch the whole show at the daily wire you don't have to bounce around first I want to talk about something else that's going on and it was going on while I was gone and it's still going on which is this upheaval on the left on the streets which is of course funded and paid for by guys like George Soros these were as Donald Trump tweeted this morning these are professional anarchists and paid protesters but but they are tapping into something that has already been going on at universities where of course we know from watching been try and go and speak at universities that they already have shut down the American commitment to free speech and you know the idea this is kind of a three-tier attack what's happening it happens on the streets it happens in the press it happens in the political arena and it's kind of interesting to watch the way these guys are flowing together you know even and it is you know people are it's you know conservatives or people who can follow any change - disaster in their imaginations that's what conservatives are they've conservatives are people who see a change and think that's the end of the world now it's over oh my god something's different everything's good that's why they're conservatives that's their natural instinct so I know people who are looking at this staunch conservative is saying oh that you know these guys they can't win by voting so they're gonna win by just destroying the country it's gonna be a revolution and this is you know this terrible thing even a guy like Michael Savage who was really out there on the right is suddenly urging Trump to not move so fast and not do so many controversial things which is strike it that just strikes me as as backing off you know I mean it reminds me of an old Jules Feiffer cartoon about feminists this is way way back in the seventies or something it was in The Village Voice and he had a cartoon of a woman screaming I want I want I want and then suddenly everything was dumped on her and she said I don't want it you know that's what reminds you know these conservatives been screaming we've got to change things and now Trump has come along and he's changing things very quickly and suddenly they're going to stop stop you know and so anyway this obviously happened in Berkeley but it also happened outside NYU where Gavin McGinnis tried to speak I think this is yesterday last night and you know Gavin McGinnis he's basically a comedian performance artist he's been he's really funny he does a lot of anti-feminist stuff and they of course they had to turn out to disturb to stop this and he NYU professor because I don't you know the thing about Berkeley they kept saying these are outside agitators and I'm sure that's largely true I'm sure there's a lot of that going on but this is a NYU college professor I don't have her name but she does look like that Melissa was a clique who was you know yeah it's better anyway she's she is screaming at the police telling them to beat up the people coming to see Gavin McGinnis this is her idea of fighting fascism is telling the police to beat up people she disagrees with listen to this so that's this is where these people are this is their mindset that this is fighting fashion fascism is to have the police beat up people you disagree with which of course is fascism I think just there to entertain and the reason the reason they're so upset at Gavin and Milo is because Gavin and Milo are them you know Gavin and Milo are both kind of left-wing people who feel the culture who understand how to troll people who understand how to do this and that's why they hate them and here's CNN reporting and listen carefully to the way they report the protein now these protests in the street people dressed in black with masks on are beating up Trump supporters with stale wine was one maced a trump supporter others are carrying rods and beating people with them okay that's what's happening in the streets of Berkeley California where the Free Speech Movement was born hahaha now okay and this is this is CNN reporting so the police didn't really do very much to stop this going you know going on they didn't you know they let this go on same thing happened at Gavin McGinnis the speech he was maced as he was walking up on stage and ultimately the crowd got so rowdy he had to stop and you know CNN at one point referred to Milo as I think they're the phrase they used was he was an extreme right-wing conservative like Bernie Sanders is an extreme left-wing liberal you know I mean it's like yeah he's an extreme right-wing conservative extremist conservative right winger you know like it's like they're justified here's here's New York Times reporter maleeni rumor that she works for the New York Times which used to be a newspaper you may remember at some of you it how it's called how violence undermined the Berkeley protests so it's like violence is some guy you know some guy named violence showed up it's like the commercial where the girl has diarrhea and her diary is played by another woman you know it's like violence showed up and disrupted the protests you know so here she says I saw someone wearing all black walk up to a student wearing a suit and say you look like a Nazi the student was confused but before he could reply the black clad person pepper sprayed him and hit him on the back with a rod this is taking place in America by the way just we were clear about this I ran after the student I ran after the reporter says I ran after the student who was attacked to get his name and more information he told me that he is a Syrian Muslim before I could find out more he fled fearing another attack amid the chaos came word the event had been cancelled it was clear early on that the majority of violent protesters most likely were not from the campus still in the aftermath I heard people say that peaceful demonstrations would not have has succeeded in preventing mr. gianopolous from speaking so was violence appropriate she asks a trump supporter was hurt a Syrian Muslim student was hurt as either of those statements seem more outrageous than the other I mean this is you know it was violence appropriate to stop Milo yu-na police from from speaking so here here is Milo speaking out this isn't I want to get cut number three here but it turns out that the progressive left for social justice left the feminist black lives matter and Tifa left the hard left which is become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years is taken a turn post Trump's election where they simply will not allow any speaker on campus even somebody is silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard they won't allow students to listen to differing points of view they're absolutely petrified by alternative visions at how the world ought to look and people with arguments and facts and reason that don't conform to the crazy social justice left vision of the universe so I was evacuated by my security detail and by the police tonight from UC Berkeley UC Berkeley of course being the home of the free-speech movement but ironic and sad that this campus appears to be nowhere no friends to free speech anymore and this you know I've talked about Milo before I actually admire his talent a lot and I respect his intelligence and I respect what he's trying to do he's trying to take the fact that he's gay and he he had the the dangerous faggot tor and all this stuff he really knows exactly he knows exactly where to get him you know he's an icon of what the left thinks the left should look like and he's a trump supporting right winger and I have talked about the fact that I think sometimes he is justified evil in his justifying kind of the that section of the alt-right which has now become a meaningless phrase meaning anybody the media dislikes but he has occasionally justified you know the white supremacists as being kind of trolls as being ironic the anti-semitism is just ironic they're just trying to say things but you know there is this place where you cross over from irony into evil and evil will always trump iron it you know you can always you can you know that's the thing you can always be sort of saying oh yes I was just being ironic when I beat that man to death it was just a comment on our times kind of performance art you know however however you know I think one of the things that you will notice by the way with the Trump administration is now they're in power all that all right stuff has gone away and Milo was on Breitbart writing that he was against white supremacy that was not the way to go that's not what he was looking for and I think you know I think that once they rode into power they understood everyone around Trump you know not everyone around Trump but so many people in his family are married to Jews or sleeping with Jews or but have converted to Judaism you know this is not an anti-semitic administration it's not a racist administration I don't think but that of course is always the left go-to phrase so they find the people in the crowd who are racist and it is possible and I think it is true that Milo may have gone down that road a little bit and I think he's realized that now however however he still has a right to speak and do his routine and basically his routine is against political correctness we have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come over to the Daily wire calm and I'll be talking about my experience at the National Prayer Breakfast watching the Donald the president the Donald and the vice president
