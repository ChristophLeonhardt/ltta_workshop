the corrupt dictatorship in Iran Iran's leaders so chaos death and destruction they do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations instead Iran's leaders plundered the nation's resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond the Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran's treasure seized valuable portions of the economy and looted the people's religious endowments all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war not good Iran's neighbors have paid a heavy toll for the region's agenda of aggression and expansion that is why so many countries in the Middle East strongly supported my decision to withdraw the United States from the horrible 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose nuclear sanctions the Iran deal was a windfall for Iran's leaders in the years since the deal was reached Iran's military budget grew nearly 40 percent the dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear capable missiles increase internal repression finance terrorism and fund havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen the United States has launched a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the funds it needs to advance its bloody agenda last month we began reimposing hard-hitting nuclear sanctions that have been lifted under the Iran deal additional sanctions will resume November 5th and war will follow and we are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially we cannot allow the world's leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet's most dangerous weapons we cannot allow a regime that chants death to America and that threatens Israel with annihilation to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on earth just can't do it we ask all nations to isolate Iran regime as long as its aggression continues and we ask all nations to support or Rantz people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny thank you for checking out our youtube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
