BE CELEBRATING.

25

HE STILL UNDERWATER, BUT FOR HIM

26
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,517
THIS IS A PEEK AT HIS APPROVAL

A PRESIDENTS FIRST MIDTERM.

33
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:52,629
IT DOES APPEAR FROM NOT JUST

34
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,363
THIS "WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL

35
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:55,032
BUT OTHER POLLS THAT THE

36
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,867
APPROVAL RATING HAS TICKED UP A

37
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:57,401
BIT.

38
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,436
IT IS STILL, AS

39
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:00,070
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

40
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:00,637
INDICATES UNDERWATER.

41
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:01,872
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS AND

42
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:03,240
THAT DOES HELP REPUBLICAN

43
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,641
CANDIDATES IN THIS UPCOMING

44
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:05,241
ELECTION FOR SURE.

45
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:05,642
>> Shannon:

46
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:06,376
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" SAYS

47
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:08,645
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

48
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:10,147
THERE'S BEEN DISCLOSURE IN KEY

49
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:10,848
SWING DISTRICTS.

50
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:12,649
THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THIS GAP HAS

51
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,250
CLOSED UP.

52
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,252
IF THEY SAY IN DISTRICTS RATED

53
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,221
AS THE MOST COMPETITIVE BY THE

54
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:17,988
NONPARTISAN POLITICAL REPORT THE

55
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,124
PARTIES ARE DEAD EVEN ON THE

56
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:20,958
QUESTION OF WHICH ONE SHOULD

57
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,458
CONTROL CONGRESS.

58
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:25,195
THE LAST ONE DEMOCRAT LEAD THAT

59
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:26,830
SAME QUESTION BY 13 PERCENTAGE

60
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:28,398
POINTS AMONG REGISTERED VOTERS

61
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:29,066
IN SIX POINTS AMONG LIKELY

62
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,000
VOTERS.

63
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,235
FOR THE G.O.P., THAT'S EXACTLY

64
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:33,604
WHAT APP YOU WANT TO SEE A

65
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:34,404
CLOSE.

66
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:35,272
>> TWO THINGS TO REMEMBER, RACE

67
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:36,173
IS TIGHT AND AS YOU GET CLOSER

68
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:38,442
TO ELECTION DAY, THAT'S USUALLY

69
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:40,110
THE PATTERN BUT CLEARLY THERE

70
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:41,478
WAS A KAVANAUGH EFFECT ON

71
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,080
REPUBLICAN VOTERS AND PERHAPS TO

72
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,548
SOME EXTENT ON DEMOCRATIC VOTERS

73
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,816
BUT DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE SO

74
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:46,583
MOTIVATED ALREADY IT'S A LITTLE

75
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,018
HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY

76
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,620
GOT MUCH EXTRA OUT OF THAT.

77
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:51,221
THEY WERE HYPED UP TO VOTE.

78
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:54,124
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE G.O.P.

79
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,125
VOTERS MAY NOW FEEL THAT WAY AS

80
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:57,461
WELL AND I'M HEARING A LOT THAT

81
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,229
TRUMP HAS A HARD CORE SUPPORTERS

82
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,231
FROM WHOM HE CAN DO NOTHING

83
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:01,899
WRONG, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER

84
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,200
CATEGORY OF VOTERS AND A RUNNING

85
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,501
TO THEM ALL THE TIME WHEN I'M

86
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:05,836
AWAY FROM WASHINGTON WHO SAY

87
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:06,703
THINGS LIKE I DON'T LIKE THIS

88
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:09,239
GUY BUT I LOVE WHAT HE'S DOING.

89
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,074
I HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME FROM

90
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:11,842
VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF

91
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,610
PEOPLE IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT

92
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,344
SITUATIONS AND I THINK THAT'S A

93
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:16,346
FACTOR OUT THERE AND IT MAY THEN

94
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:18,482
THEREFORE -- IT MAY BE SHOWING

95
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:19,650
UP AT HIS APPROVAL RATING TO

96
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,652
SOME EXTENT AND IT MAY SHOW UP

97
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,053
IN SUPPORT FOR CONGRESSIONAL

98
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:24,121
CANDIDATES RUNNING AS

99
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:24,521
REPUBLICANS.

100
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:25,222
>> Shannon: SOMEONE SAID THE

101
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,925
EXACT SAME THING LAST WEEK.

102
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:30,060
THEY WERE VERY AWARE OF WHAT HE

103
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,762
WAS DOING, BUSINESS OWNER,

104
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:33,630
FEDERAL JUDGES, THE BENCH.

105
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,331
PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION.

106
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:37,634
THERE'S BEEN A LOT MADE ABOUT

107
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:39,002
SUBURBAN WOMEN, FEMALE MOTHERS,

108
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,205
FAMILIES, HOW THEY WOULD VOTE.

109
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:43,073
THE POLL MAY EXPLAIN WHY THE

110
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,074
COMPETITIVE SWING DISTRICTS THAT

111
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:44,875
WILL DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE

00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:46,376
HOUSE ARE MOSTLY IN SUBURBAN

113
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:48,378
DISTRICTS AND AMONG SUBURBAN

114
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,813
RESIDENTS THE PARTIES ARE

115
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:51,882
VIRTUALLY TIED.

116
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:54,551
44% FAVOR G.O.P. CONTROL AND 45

117
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:55,052
FAVORITE DEMOCRAT.

118
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,721
>> THAT WAS THE FACT THAT WHILE

119
00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:59,256
THE PRESIDENT DON'T DO TOO WELL

120
00:02:59,257 --> 00:02:59,957
AMONG WOMEN PRESSURE,

121
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,658
PARTICULARLY SUBURBAN WOMEN,

122
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,292
THEY DO QUITE WELL AMONG

123
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:04,228
SUBURBAN MEN.

124
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:05,629
IT MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET

125
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,230
THAT ADVANTAGE.

126
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:07,331
THIS COULD TURN OUT TO BE, EVEN

127
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,966
IN THE HOUSE, A MUCH CLOSER

128
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:10,834
AFFAIR THAN WE'VE IMAGINED.

129
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:11,935

WHO KNOWS HOW MANY SCANDALS WILL

135
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:19,509
ERUPT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.

136
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,645
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE

137
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:22,479
IMPACT ON THE HOUSE BECAUSE IF

138
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,714
THE DEMOCRATS RETAKE IT A LOT OF

139
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:25,549
THINGS WILL CHANGE.

140
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,650
A LOT OF THESE ARE THE

141
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:27,885
INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON LEAD BY

BYRON YORK WRITES A VERY

146
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:34,191
INTERESTING PIECE AND HE POINTS

147
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,859
AT THE THINGS THAT AMERICA

148
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,227
WOULDN'T KNOW IF NOT FOR THESE

149
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:37,694
INVESTIGATIONS.

150
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,229
JUST A PARTIAL LIST WE HAVE

151
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,865
HERE, THE ROLE THAT THAT DOSSIER

152
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,667
PLAYED IN THE FBI INVESTIGATION,

153
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:44,968
WHO FUNDED THE DOSSIER, THE

154
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,570
ANTI-TRUMP BIAS OF SOME OF THE

155
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,071
TOP FBI OFFICIALS INVOLVED WITH

156
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:49,840
THIS WHOLE THING.

157
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,074
OBAMA OFFICIALS UNMASKING FROM

158
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:51,675
PROFESSIONALS AND INTEL

162
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,113
LIST AND THOSE ARE ALL THINGS

163
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:59,249
THAT WERE UNCOVERED BY THE HOUSE

164
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,917
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE UNDER

165
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:02,286
DEVIN NUNES WHICH CARRIED ON ITS

166
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:05,622
INVESTIGATION, STERN AND

167
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:06,857
UNFLINCHING DEMOCRATIC

168
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:08,025
RESISTANCE, EVERYTHING THEY DID

169
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:09,059
WITH ADAM SCHIFF, RANKING

170
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,027
DEMOCRAT ON THE COMMITTEE

171
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:10,894
RUNNING OUT TO THE CAMERAS AND

172
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:12,429
MICROPHONES ALL THE TIME WITH A

173
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,631
VERY SYMPATHETIC MEDIA AUDIENCE

174
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,266
AND THE COMMITTEE WAS ABLE TO

175
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:17,668
UNEARTH ALL THAT STUFF AND WE

176
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:18,401
WOULDN'T KNOW IT WITHOUT IT.

177
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:20,103
WHAT IS SURPRISING TO ME IS THE

178
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,272
ANTIPATHY TOWARDS HIM NOT JUST

179
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:22,973
AMONG LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS

180
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:24,708
WHICH WOULD KIND OF EXPECT BUT

181
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,076
EVEN AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS.

182
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:27,411
AND I THINK HE'S BEEN UNFAIRLY

183
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:30,213
MALIGNED IN THE MEDIA COVERAGE,

184
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:31,014
IT'S BEEN ATROCIOUS.

185
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:32,749
>> Shannon: IT'S NOT JUST THAT

186
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,483
THESE INVESTIGATIONS WOULD GRIND

187
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:35,886
TO A SCREECHING HALT.

188
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,220
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THE

189
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,221
PRESIDENT WOULD ACTUALLY THEN BE

190
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:38,855
A TARGET AND?

191
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,324
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD

192
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:41,591
BE A CONSTANT TARGET.

193
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,260

00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,328
HOUSE, I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THEY

195
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,662

196
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:46,463
SOME MEMBERS WILL WANT TO, I'M

197
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:48,131
NOT SURE HOW FAR THAT WILL GO,

198
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,766
BUT THERE WILL BE AN ENDLESS

199
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,501
SERIES OF INVESTIGATION AND

200
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:52,569
CHARGES IN TESTIMONY AND UNLIKE

201
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,838
THE DEVIN NUNES INVESTIGATION

202
00:04:54,839 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL LIKELY
