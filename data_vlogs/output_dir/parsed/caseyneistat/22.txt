what's the verdict with this whole thing
the whole your broken shoulder and
basically it's it's a fracture on the
top of the shoulder so like when the
joint pulls out when it dislocates the
circuits like so quickly that it takes a
piece of poetry so there's a loose piece
of bone at the top but if I I don't need
surgery which is great
