1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,457
>> Shannon: JUDGE KAVANAUGH

2
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,292

00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,660
ALSO SAYING THE WHOLE

4
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,762
CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS BEEN

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,262
FAIR AND THOROUGH.

6
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:16,098
SENATOR GRASSLEY THEN TURNING TO

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,066
THE DEMOCRATS STRAIGHT AT THE

8
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:18,367
MEDIA.

9
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:19,735
>> I WOULD NEVER USE THE WORD

10
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:20,268
FAKE NEWS.

11
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:23,638
I CONSIDER YOU FOLKS POLICEMAN

00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:26,408
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE SOME OF

15
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:30,479
YOU HAVE BIAS.

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,013
I HAVE HAD DEMONSTRATORS IN MY

17
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:34,349
OFFICE FOR TWO WEEKS NOW.

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,618
THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE

19
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,052
INTERVIEWED.

20
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:42,224
THEY SAID, WE ONLY INTERESTED IN

21
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:44,259
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AGAINST

22
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,726
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

23
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:49,664
>> Shannon: HOW FAR     FIRED UE

24
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:50,065
GETS!

25
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:52,234
SENATOR, YOU'VE HAD A LONG FEW

26
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:52,534
WEEKS.

27
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:53,135
>> I HAVE.

28
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,070
IT HAS BEEN A LONG FEW MONTHS.

29
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,038
THINKING ABOUT THE NOMINATION

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,341
AND IT WAS ON JULY NINTH, A LOT

31
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,276
OF WORK WAS DONE AND THE

32
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:02,077
PREPARATION OF THE DOCUMENTS IN

33
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:05,046
THE HEARINGS ARE 32 HOURS.

34
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:05,647
THE FOLLOW-UP EARRINGS.

35
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,482
FOUR AND HALF HOURS IN THE

36
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:09,718
FACILITY TODAY REVIEWING.

37
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,120
>> Shannon: WHAT CAN YOU TELL

38
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:13,588
US?

39
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:17,459
>> IF ANYTHING I FEEL LIKE WHAT

40
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,128
WE REVIEW TODAY IN THE

41
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,132
CLASSIFIED SETTING IS EVEN

42
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,635
FURTHER GALVANIZING MY BELIEF.

43
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:28,837
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE

44
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,838
CONFIRMATION.

45
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,139
>> Shannon: ONE OF YOUR

46
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,240
DEMOCRAT KIND OF PARKS HAD THIS

47
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:34,075
TO SAY ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE

48
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:34,177
REPORT.

49
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:42,484
>> IT IS A INVESTIGATION.

50
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:44,886
THAT IS NOT A FULL AND THOROUGH

51
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:45,320
INVESTIGATION.

52
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,689
>> Shannon: WHAT YOU SAY TO

53
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,056
THAT?

54
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:48,890
WITHOUT DR. FORD AND BRETT

55
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,258
KAVANAUGH TO BE REINTERVIEWED.

56
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,127
IT WOULD BE THEIR FIRST FBI

57
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,694
INTERVIEWS.

58
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,762
ON THE SAME POINTS THAT YOU HAVE

59
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:57,833
ALL INVESTIGATED.

60
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:01,336
>> I THINK THAT SENATOR IS JUST

61
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:03,238
GOING RIGHT INTO THE MARKETING

62
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,674
ARM OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

63
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:08,243
LOOK, WE HAVE SEVEN MEMBERS OF

64
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:10,111
THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE

65
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:10,712
EXPERIENCED PROSECUTORS.

66
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,648
EXPERIENCE PROSECUTORS PAIRED WE

67
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:14,249
PUT ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL

68
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,684
PROSECUTOR WHO HAS BEEN

69
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,486
PROSECUTING CRIMES FOR ALMOST 25

70
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:18,086
YEARS.

71
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:19,855
WE DID THAT FOR A REASON.

72
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,089
WE WANTED STRUCTURE, WE WANTED

73
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,424
AN APPROACH THAT WE COULD

74
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,124
PRESENT INFORMATION THAT YOU

75
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,460
WOULD TAKE BEFORE A JUDGE TO GET

76
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,663
AN ARREST WARRANT OR TO GET A

77
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:29,464
SEARCH WARRANT.

78
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:30,332
NONE OF THE DATA ROSE TO A LEVEL

79
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,435
THAT WOULD KEEP --

80
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:34,002
THAT WOULD EVER ALLOW

81
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,838
PROSECUTION TO MOVE FORWARD.

82
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:39,174
THERE WERE TWO HOURS ON BOTH

83
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:40,008
SIDES.

84
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,277
WE ASKED DR. FORD TO SUBMIT ANY

85
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,845
INFORMATION SHE WANTED TO ON THE

86
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:45,413
RECORD WITH THE ADVICE OF HER

87
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,081
COUNSEL.

88
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:46,848
WE GAVE DOCTOR FOR THE

89
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,049
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN OPENING

90
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,784
STATEMENT, TO GO AS LONG AS SHE

91
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:51,953
WANTED TO GO AND THAT THE END OF

92
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,021
HER TESTIMONY WE ASKED HER IF

93
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:55,657
SHE HAD ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD.

94
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,659
HOW CAN ANYBODY THINK WITH SEVEN

95
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,460
PROSECUTORS, 21 MEMBERS OF THE

96
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:02,430
COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXPERIENCE

97
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:03,164
PROSECUTORS THAT THEY'RE GETTING

98
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:05,433
ANYTHING ELSE OUT OF IT?

99
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:06,868
HE WANT THE DELAY.

100
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,436
THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS.

101
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:10,472
I THINK JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN

102
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,940
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR

103
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,674
HIS GOOD NAME.

104
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:13,708
I THOUGHT I DID A GOOD JOB LAST

105
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,876
WEEK.

106
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:15,176
IT'S.

107
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,044
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

108
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:18,580
>> Shannon: WOULD HE THINK WHO

109
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:21,483
SAID, HIS FAMILY MUCH LIKE

110
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:22,117
PROFESSOR FORD AND OTHERS

111
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,852
INVOLVED IN THIS HAD BEEN PUT

112
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:25,620
THROUGH A MEAT GRINDER

113
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:26,021
ESSENTIALLY.

114
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,222
HE WAS FIRED UP.

115
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,257
PEOPLE FELT LIKE HE SHOULDN'T OF

116
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:32,227
BEEN INTERRUPTING SENATORS.

117
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:33,595
DOES HE HAVE A FAIR CHANCE?

118
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,831
TO GO TO THE BENCH?

119
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,732
TO HAVE A FRESH START OR DO YOU

120
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,834
THINK IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE

121
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:40,535
HOUNDED BY THESE ACCUSATIONS?

122
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,672
>> Laura: I DON'T THINK SO.

123
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,140
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN TWICE

124
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,611
CONFIRMED, UNANIMOUSLY

125
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:50,078
WELL-QUALIFIED.

126
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,446
THEY SPECIFICALLY IN THE

127
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:52,414
RECOMMENDATION TALK ABOUT HIS

128
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:52,847
TEMPERAMENTS.

129
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:54,049
WHAT WE SAW LAST WEEK, WE HAVE

130
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,184
TO GO BACK TO THE 32 HOURS OF

131
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,120
HEARINGS WHERE HE WAS VERY

132
00:03:59,121 --> 00:03:59,521
RESPECTFUL.

133
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,289
HE WAS ASKED SOME OUTLANDISH

134
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:01,656
QUESTIONS.

135
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,658
HE WAS INTERRUPTED A NUMBER OF

136
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,226
TIMES.

137
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,027
THAT WAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

138
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:06,761
THAT WAS A TEMPERAMENTAL SHOW ON

139
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:09,197
THE BENCH.

140
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:09,898
LAST WEEK WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH.

141
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,667
A MAN WHOSE WIFE HAS HAD DEATH

142
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:13,435
THREATS.

143
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:14,469
HAS 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER HAS

144
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,670
BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY THIS.

145
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,605
THEY ARE DRAGGING HIS NAME

146
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,673
THROUGH THE MUD.

147
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:20,608
WE SAW THE MAN, THE FATHER AND

148
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,876
THE HUSBAND DEFENDING HIM AND

149
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:22,277
HIS FAMILY.

150
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,646
I THINK HE DID IT AND AN

151
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:25,180
APPROPRIATE MANNER.

152
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,414
I THINK MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN

153
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:29,451
AMERICA BELIEVE THE SAME.

154
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,086
>> Shannon: THE IDEA OF

155
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:32,721
GETTING BACK TO CIVILITY, WHERE

156
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:33,521
WE GO FROM HERE?

157
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,757
>> I TOLD THE REPORTER EARLIER

158
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,459
TODAY, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

159
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,395
THAT THE AGENDA THAT WE HAD FOR

160
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:42,497
THE MARKUP FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH,

161
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:44,466
WE ALWAYS WE DISAGREE.

162
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,334
MOST DEMOCRATS WILL VOTE AGAINST

163
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:46,801
THIS.

164
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:48,803
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF BIPARTISAN

165
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:49,537
PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL

166
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,872
MOVE THROUGH.

167
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,474
THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

168
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,341
TO GO BACK TO YOU.

169
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:54,542
GRAHAM HAS HAD THIS.

170
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:58,446
WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND I THINK

171
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,915
AND PROVE THE REPUTATION THE

172
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:01,282
COMMITTEE.

173
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:04,386
I THINK IT HAS SUFFERED BY

174
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,221
CONFIDENTIALITY BEING BRIEFED.

175
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,156
BY THE SPARTACUS MOMENT.

176
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:11,226
BY SENATOR BOOKER.

177
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:11,926
PUBLISHING INFORMATION THAT WE

178
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,762
HAVE MADE AVAILABLE WITHIN AN

179
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,630
HOUR OR TWO.

180
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,198
IF I AM SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO

181
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,068
HELP A COMMITTEE, BUT I KNOW

182
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,039
THAT I EXPOSE --

183
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,006
ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS, WE HAVE

184
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:27,676
A LOT TO WORK TO DO.

185
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,678
A LOT OF THAT BLAME ON THE

186
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,046
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T

187
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:31,780
RESPECT THE PROCESS.

188
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,516
THEY DIDN'T RESPECT THE CHAIR

189
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:35,884
WHO HAS A WONDERFUL REPUTATION.

190
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,053
LET'S WORK ON THAT FIRST.

191
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,854
