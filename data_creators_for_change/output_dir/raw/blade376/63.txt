music his hobbies or the alleged way he

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,259
treats his fans but when Justin Bieber

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,849
reaches out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on Twitter with some</font>

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,070
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> words I'd be lying if I said I</font>

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:19,830
didn't care to receive a tweet

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,529
personally from<font color="#E5E5E5"> justin bieber is well</font>

8
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,570
surreal but it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be said i have</font>

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,789
been tweeted by celebrities before take

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,279
for example sir patrick stewart or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ricky</font>

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">gervais however all three of these</font>

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
tweets have something in common they are

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">all fake and although there are a few</font>

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,980
small giveaways in the screenshots<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,379
they are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact fabricated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty</font>

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,210
sure the majority of you thought they

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,489
were legit it is pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anyone</font>

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mock up a fake tweet thanks to the</font>

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,320
website let me tweet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you calm</font>

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,480
and no this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not an endorsement so why</font>

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,879
have I brought this up well a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few weeks</font>

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,350
ago there were some controversy

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,300
surfacing on Twitter regarding an

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,460
alleged deleted tweet by British

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,859
journalist Piers Morgan around the time

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,359
that it was announced that his show and

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,150
CNN was being axed it turned out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,070
fake but that didn't prevent it from

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,470
circulating around social media getting

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,450
anyone who believed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it quite roiled</font>

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,610
up here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> indications that the</font>

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,040
tweet was fake number one there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,710
verification tick by his name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,390
by looking his profile you'll see that

35
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,640
piers morgan is in fact a verified

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter account number two there is a</font>

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,409
delete button underneath his alleged

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,119
tweet because why would it give you the

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">option to delete a tweet that wasn't</font>

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,290
your own number three<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter doesn't</font>

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">publicly show users where tweets have</font>

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,720
come from well not since mid 2012 anyway

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,790
so the clue here is where it says via

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter number four if this was a real</font>

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,500
tweet the retweet and favorite values

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,090
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> color the fake</font>

47
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,710
tweet builder may not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce</font>

48
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,350
completely convincing tweets just yet

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,509
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens when it does or if</font>

50
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,770
someone spends a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time on</font>

51
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Photoshop then how are we supposed to</font>

52
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,560
differentiate between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real deleted</font>

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,810
tweet stories and the fake ones because

54
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,219
surely there are going to be occasions

55
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,380
where influential people publicly state

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,929
something online receive a backlash for

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,239
whatever reason and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thus decide to</font>

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,420
retract it and

59
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,220
therefore websites like let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me tweet</font>

60
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,930
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you calm will make the whole</font>

61
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,090
accountability process that extra bit

62
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,209
more harder to uphold another example a

63
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,599
quick one is Paris Hilton now regardless

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you may think of her is it fair</font>

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so many people believe she said</font>

66
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,340
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact had not said</font>

67
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,110
now you may believe this is nothing new

68
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,450
or is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes with the</font>

69
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,450
territory of being famous I'm just very

70
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,120
fascinated by how easy is becoming to

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,980
imitate other people online and

72
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,920
therefore having the ability to bring

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,830
their integrity into questioning wrongly

74
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,040
I mean social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> has empowered the</font>

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,890
masses with the ability to process and

76
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,230
share information on an unprecedented

77
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,660
scale and it's for reasons like the ones

78
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,940
I've demonstrated in this video that I

79
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,730
feel collectively we need to get a lot

80
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,730
better at verifying information before

81
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,650
we share it and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why I tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

82
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,049
hit home quite often the importance of

83
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,480
critical thinking and why we should use

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,010
the tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our own</font>

85
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,930
journalists<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sharing information</font>

86
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,570
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> days can be quite a quick simple</font>

87
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,140
task of just a couple of clicks and when

88
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information which hasn't been</font>

89
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,609
verified which is false it's not

90
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,519
constructive and it can sometimes be

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,310
harmful to others what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you think let</font>

92
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,600
me know in the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> below I'd love</font>
