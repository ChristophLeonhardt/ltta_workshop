1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
patriotism should never be used as a

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,549
sword to condemn or demean it should

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,250
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used as a look at me I'm so</font>

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,690
much better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you because I'm more</font>

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,690
patriotic and patriotism should not be

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,179
about simple slogans or songs or flag

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,010
pins you know I often say about religion

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,480
before you tell me about your<font color="#CCCCCC"> religion</font>

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,460
show it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how you treat other</font>

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,109
people I'm a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> believer that we</font>

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">demonstrate our truth by what we do more</font>

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,039
than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say patriotism again is</font>

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,230
about love of country but you cannot

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,269
love your country unless you love her

15
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,500
people and love is not about celebrity

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,300
or not about popularity it's not about

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
attracting attention to yourself love is

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,670
humble love is kind love is seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,730
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> in grand gestures but in an</font>

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,190
attitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we encounter what we do</font>

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,350
when we encounter others how we extend

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,090
ourselves how we take risks I understand

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,850
it we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a campaign and again I'm a</font>

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,770
politician I'm an elected leader and

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,379
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give off these symbols but you</font>

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,239
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> between our campaigns and in our</font>

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,160
neighborhoods and our communities we

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,809
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do need patriotism we need to</font>

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,240
elevate those voices those examples in

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,770
our society more than what's being

31
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,229
elevated right now which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

32
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,320
often very toxic and helps to weaken our

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,600
bonds so one another helps to divide<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,049
nation and ultimately as a great

35
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,430
president once said a house divided

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:00:00,000
cannot stand
