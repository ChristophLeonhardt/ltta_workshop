I was at business school our homework consisted of having to run a lot of numbers what I would write at home my homework may be wrong and people in the blackboard would erase numbers and put new numbers up and I started saying oh if only I had a magic blackboard I had my TI business analyst calculator and I was sitting in a class with with many other people and I would sit there for daydreaming a bit and said if only this had like a head-up display so I could see like a screen in front of me kind of like Google glass or something and imagine it had a ball on the back of it like a mouse and I could put a number in an another number and I could look you straight in the face and say yet ten percent would be okay because I could do my calculation I could type new numbers in and have it recalculate that was my vision and then the hard part was how to turn that vision into a real program the challenge was could I take these ideas and implement them in at 16k fortunately a floppies became available in time the original version we supported his set takes the storage it should have been it's the pain but it did work I work at night because computer time was cheaper night we were using a time sharing system we have to pay for the night journey unlike so unless it's cheaper night much cheaper but unlike some Harvard students with kinds of trouble for using the computers to write a basic program well mention names we actually paid upfront for one of the names that had come up with his electoral integer and regular calculator calculator the problem I had with Prem ledger is nobody outside financier know my jokes but it was a vegetable calculating the way thought of it so it's obvious that visible tacular visicalc when Apple was gonna go public they couldn't go public so I found the last bug in the Apple TV's a guy trying to find this bug and they were like this is a very interesting time because Bob was working on the Apple three visit count and the Apple 3 was the new Apple the first business version of the Apple they were going to do and Apple was holding off going public they brought another director it seemed really weird that as soon as we okay the shipment when Bob we finally okayed the shipment the next day they actually went public one of the things in historically surprised me was what is the music health one things we thought about was when somebody gonna copy the civility what is amazing is how many years it took for somebody to basically do a good copy of it you need to be able to use what you had before and move it forward and luckily for us the files that were used for VisiCalc could be read by one two three Lotus made sure they could read them and then Microsoft when they did Excel made sure Excel could read the files that came from one two three so there is a path all the way through which is kind of cool in 1982 January 1982 here's Bob and me on the cover of ink magazine okay and inside there's there pictures of you know other people in the computer business the birth of a new industry and there you can see mister file stro over here and you can see Bill Gates and people like that okay and inside is you know Fortune magazine is a little earlier June of 1981 here's you know Bob and me in here this is the first time in a major business public or actually any business publication not a computer publication the spreadsheet what's wrong a spreadsheet we mentioned that's not when I knew we made it cover who magazine does not mean success that means oddity or something like that right it means something unusual having some business people think it says a thing they don't know about that's not making it making it is when everybody does know about it so for me it was when I opened up the Wall Street Journal one day and in the editorial section it said there's this new budget coming out from Reagan or something and it said all over Washington VisiCalc spreadsheets and yellowroot ledger pads are being used to figure out what it means it was assumed that you knew what visicalc was that for me was the moment when I understood we had really made we got really close to our calculators and we just live by these things okay because all the cases were built so you needed to do calculators I got so close to mine that for Halloween I came dressed up as a TI business analyst calculate
