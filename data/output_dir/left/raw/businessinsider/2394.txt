1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,730
this is you ask we answer and let's get

2
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the questions you sent to</font>

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
us very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is if people are</font>

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,460
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell gold silver etc four</font>

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,980
dollars is a dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in so much</font>

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,230
trouble this is a version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the classic</font>

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,840
traders dilemma if somebody is willing

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell you something shouldn't you be</font>

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,539
suspicious that maybe you shouldn't be

10
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,390
buying it the fact is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all have</font>

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">different theories about the direction</font>

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,500
the market is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and beyond that we</font>

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,590
have different timelines in which to our

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,860
liquidity demands shift so the fact that

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,450
somebody's willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell you something</font>

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,460
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't buy it and in</font>

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,809
this case the fact that people are

18
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to sell gold four dollars is not</font>

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,649
really an indication of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dollar</font>

20
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:04,899
strength second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question comes from Sam</font>

21
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:08,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">depres he says is it correct that by</font>

22
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,240
selling more Treasury bonds the

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,010
government is actually supporting the

24
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,080
dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> since foreigners</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buzz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars first and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go buy Treasuries</font>

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,909
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to this and clearly</font>

27
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,100
selling the dollar denominated assets

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,549
whether they're US Treasuries bonds sold

29
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,869
by foreign governments that are also

30
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,689
sold in dollar denominations does

31
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,330
support the dollar to an extent the

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,880
problem is over the long term selling

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,640
lots of us treasuries creates pressure

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,680
on the dollar because people<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect</font>

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have to inflate</font>

36
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,560
its way out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> massive amount of</font>

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
debt right now in fact we have a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,890
reversal of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> usual system the Fed is</font>

39
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,840
actually buying Treasuries which means

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,670
it is pumping more dollars into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,950
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and taking Treasuries out of the</font>

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,280
system what that means is that selling

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,229
more Treasuries and then forcing the Fed

44
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,640
to come in and buy it it's actually

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably undermining the dollar next one</font>

46
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,650
from Brent he wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know do we think</font>

47
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,079
that online<font color="#E5E5E5"> poker should be regulated by</font>

48
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,499
the US government absolutely not nothing

49
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,569
about the US government would make it a

50
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,340
good regulator of on

51
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,500
nine poker they're not very good at

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,810
regulating very much online at all

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,709
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> gambling seems a kind of crazy</font>

54
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,510
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to involve the US</font>

55
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,040
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it would be far better</font>

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,319
handled by<font color="#E5E5E5"> States local municipalities</font>

57
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,110
and probably left on its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

58
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,730
add that the biggest proponents of

59
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,890
wanting to regulate online gambling are

60
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,799
of course the casinos they want it to be

61
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,870
stomped out so that you have to go spend

62
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">your money in the in their shops rather</font>

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,280
than be able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it online let's not</font>

64
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,269
let the<font color="#CCCCCC"> special-interest win this one</font>

65
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,680
how would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe both your</font>

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,769
political and economic meanings asks our

67
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:05,709
commenters<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you writer well I'm glad</font>

68
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you asked that I'm a reactionary</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means tune in next week and</font>

71
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,910
ask the question what is a reactionary

72
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,170
decadent anarchist Gordon asks do you

73
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,900
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an adequate return</font>

74
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,910
on investment on your Penn law degree

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,519
working at the Business Insider big

76
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,829
question Gordon the answer is certainly

77
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,000
yes I was getting a slightly higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,090
much higher pay level when I back when I

79
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,859
was a corporate lawyer but I was nowhere

80
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">near as happy could I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done this</font>

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">without my pen law degree well my</font>

82
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,400
experience being a lawyer informs my

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,500
reporting and also provided me with

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,540
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of the people who I talk</font>

85
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,910
to to get our stories so yeah I think

86
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,900
the rate of return is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good next</font>

87
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,790
if the Sherman Act were to be invoked

88
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">preserved presumably to regulate the</font>

89
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,709
banks who would lead that Treasury

90
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,810
justice it would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justice</font>

91
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,359
Department which is actually a good

92
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,190
reason not to invoke it the Justice

93
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,440
Department is not really equipped to

94
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,540
regulate the banking industry that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at things so we</font>

probably don't want to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing in</font>

97
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,858
the sherman act as a sort of easy way of

trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break up the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too-big-to-fail</font>

100
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,500
fight Adam Smith or Superman

101
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,600
at first I thought that answer this

102
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,480
would be easy Adam Smith after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

103
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,640
Superman's not a real person so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can't</font>

104
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">win a fight then again Adam Smith is</font>

105
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,070
dead so it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for him to win a</font>

106
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,300
fight I give it to a tie thank you this
