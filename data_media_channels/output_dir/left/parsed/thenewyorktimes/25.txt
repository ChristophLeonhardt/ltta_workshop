This is what liquefaction
looks like.
It’s one of the most
devastating effects
of an earthquake.
Soil breaks down
and flows like water.
It happens when a quake
strikes an area
with loose, moist soil
that’s been shaken violently.
The soil behaves like a liquid,
with frightening results.
Indonesian officials say
more than 2,000 homes
have been destroyed after
a 7.5-magnitude earthquake
triggered liquefaction
in some areas.
Here’s the village
where this video was filmed.
It’s located 8.5 miles
from the coast.
This is what it looked
like before the earthquake.
And this is what
it looks like now.
Here, we see where
the houses once stood.
Now, there’s nothing left.
This other video shows
the same phenomenon
in a neighborhood
in the city of Palu.
It has also been
largely destroyed.
And here is another
neighborhood
that has been devastated.
But liquefaction was
responsible for only part
of the destruction
after the earthquake.
On the coast, a tsunami ripped
apart the infrastructure:
like this bridge
and this beachfront.
More than 1,200 people
have died
and officials fear 
the death toll could rise
as rescue teams continue
their search for survivors.
