1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,670
When I’m beginning to dance on the train,
my hands, my palms always sweat.

2
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,820
But it's like, it's an
adrenaline rush.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,200
I just wait for the music to
come on and get in my zone,

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,340
and I just block everything out
and just listen for the beat.

5
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,320
And I'm like in my own world,
where it's just like

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm walking on air and space.
And it’s like no one is there.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,780
But I know that someone
is watching.

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,300
I made it my business to know
how to maneuver around people,

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,140
what obstacles are there,
so we can look smooth, look clean

10
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,430
and the show is a good show
without corrupting something

11
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,790
and disturbing the peace.

12
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,090
A lot of people get on a train
and get out some anger

13
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,910
and get out a loss.

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:00:00,000
They come and dance and
let it go, be free.
