As an architecture student,
I had a professor that said I
didn't have the pedigree or
ideas or skill set to sort
of work in any sort
of important context.
So every no is perfect for me.
I thrive off a no.
Off-White is sort of my resume
and mood board for an actual
idea that I have for like
the modern luxury brand.
It's almost like a laboratory.
For me, it's like my teenage
years is the foundation
for everything that I've
sort of done afterward.
I was like an average, sort
of, suburban kid that was
skateboarding, listening to
Nirvana, Beastie Boys, rap,
Wu-Tang.
Like you say the music,
you can think of a look.
And so as I started
thinking about clothing,
I was always like drawn to
what my initial interest was,
and that was T-shirts.
For Off-White, my contribution
was I would take a young idea
of streetwear, this idea
that T-shirts and hoodies are
important, but making that in
the same factories as luxury
houses.
So that's why we're in Italy.
This is men's team working on
pre-collection next season.
Shoes are happening in the back.
This is the women's room.
I just moved to this newer space
because the concept is growing.
How's it going?
New office, it's nice in here.
But I have no desk in the world.
 I travel probably,
like, 320 days a year,
eight flights a week--
Chicago, Frankfurt, Milan,
London, Berlin, Stockholm,
Rotterdam, Amsterdam,
Vegas, and LA.
It's a lot.
I work on the street
literally, like phone in hand.
I feel like Off-White be one of
the truly first, sort of, like,
a luxury brand that's been
just built from social media.
It behaves in this
sort of hybrid,
in between a traditional system
and a new system less than
streetwear, that clothes just
come out at different times.
They're posted on Instagram,
and consumers can buy them.
And I'm interested in that
hybrid in between them both.
I'm directly pointed at this
generation that hasn't been
messaged luxury to yet.
As an Off-White sort of look,
I'm looking to put this with
like a T-shirt
and jeans perhaps.
This Millennial young person,
they love to covet things.
They're sort of waiting for
a designer that sort of faced
to them.
I want to make a modern
version of her wedding dress.
I like this.
I like seeing the shoulder.
I love this idea that Off-White
can go from like a study
graphic T-shirts all the way to
a wedding dress under this sort
of muse that I've
dictated for the season.
This current collection
that I'm developing,
choosing Princess
Diana, the muse,
is sort of this resonance.
It's super like young Diana.
Yeah, I couldn't be happier.
It looks like the sketch.
Can you walk?
This is always what
I wanted to do.
And no one does it, haute
couture meets street.
But people say it all the time.
I've had the fortunate ability
to sort of craft my own path.
People ask me all the time,
do you feel some sense of like
achievement or fulfillment?
And the answer's zero.
I have no-- there's no
feedback loop that's like, yes.
I'm only interested in
my making new things,
like getting to this
place of the next idea.
I think bell bottoms are going
to come back because everyone
has in their closet skinny
jeans, boyfriend jeans.
I also like for women,
let's buy dickies,
girls in dickies pants, cropped.
