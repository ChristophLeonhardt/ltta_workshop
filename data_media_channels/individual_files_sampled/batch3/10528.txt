UK security Minister has slammed media reports that police have identified those behind the poisoning of the scruples as ill-informed wild speculation on Thursday the Press Association news agency citing their source close to the probe claiming the perpetrators have been found and it's set the media abuzz police investigating this particular incident back in March believe that they do have the identity of two suspects the Press Association says police believe they have identified those who carried out the Nava chalk attack in Salisbury police in Britain are reported to have identified several people they believe were behind the nerve agent attack on the former Russian spy circus cripple and his daughter Yulia now the media frenzy was sparked by just one tweet from a news agency it's either a source claiming that UK police have identified the suspects behind the scruple poisoning Polly Boyko looks into the story a source with knowledge of the probe told Press Association investigators believe they have identified the suspected perpetrators behind the novel shock attack on the scruples this is all allegedly come from a source close to the police investigation into the original attack against these scribbles back in March and this source has spoken to the Press Association they're the ones reporting it and they've said that investigators are apparently closing in on the suspected perpetrators of the attack and the police have allegedly been looking at CCTV footage they've been examining it and also looking at records of people who had entered and left the country around the time of the attack against the scribbles in March because and the bombshell really in all these reports is that these suspects are allegedly Russian it is important to note that these are unconfirmed reports as yet so far it's just come from this one article by the Press Association but it's done the rounds and it's pretty big headline news here in the UK even though we haven't had any updates from the police or the authorities in regards to the investigation hasn't stopped the press speculation though just to give you an example the Sun newspaper has elaborated on the story saying that Scotland Yard apparently believes that it was a two-man hit team that carried out the attack on the scruples and that they did it on the orders of the Kremlin and furthermore that the pair of thought to have left the UK for Russia the morning after the attack and to quote the newspaper they're thought to be under the protection of President Vladimir Putin so that's the source of reports that are in the press here right now Moscow has consistently denied any claims of wrongdoing even though the British government pointed the finger squarely at the Kremlin in the days after the attack saying that it's highly likely that Russia ordered the poisoning and now following these new unconfirmed reports the Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakov an Co has already responded take a listen eh give pretty Britain's case now we say only leaks to British media and official statements from the Interior Ministry of Scotland Yard are absent nobody in this world has official information concerning what exactly happened in the UK and in a way there you can see the Russian diplomat really upping the ante saying we'll go on then give us these names if you're going to make these allegations we want to see evidence of it and we've just got a line from the Russian Foreign Ministry as well they've said that if the UK keeps these alleged Russian suspects classified if this case becomes secret well then Moscow will regard it as a cover-up of the perpetrators so there's clearly a sense of increasing frustration here I would say from the Russian side that the British media can sort of go on making these allegations almost indefinitely without a shred of evidence from the authorities and without any official statements from the police investigation to back it up you
