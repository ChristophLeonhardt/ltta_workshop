tonight Stacey Abrams became the first african-american woman to be a major party nominee for governor anywhere in the United States she is a graduate of Yale Law School she was the first woman to lead the Democrats in the Georgia General Assembly she was the first african-american to lead the Democrats in the Georgia House of Representatives here is some of her victory speech tonight I'm running because I want every Georgia family to have the freedom and opportunity to thrive you deserve nothing less and I know Georgia can deliver a whole lot more but here's the thing to claim our victory to write that next chapter and live those best lives we have a lot of work to do we have to reach out to those who do not believe their voices matter who've been disappointed again and again by promises made and never kept who live in counties crushed by poverty and neglect in suburbs isolated from jobs and opportunity and sometimes from each other in cities where lack of affordability makes it harder and harder to stay and in the next six months we are going to have to work together to remake our Georgia with your help we will register every last person we know and we're gonna search out those we don't know yet and prove they matter to us too because our campaign will be a coalition that reaches across backgrounds sharing our constant belief in our capacity to win and with your hands knocking and your feet walking and your voices speaking out every Georgian we touch will understand the value and the immense power of our votes in action in action can be contagious but so can a passion for change from our campuses to our neighborhood blocks from our senior centers outwards a wave is coming and I know Georgians won't stand on the sidelines because you see in the book of Esther in the book of Esther there's a verse that reminds us that we were born for such a time and now is the time to defend our values and protect the vulnerable to stand in the gap and to lead the way a time to know that this democracy only works when we work for it and that's what we've done tonight and that is what we will continue to do all the way to victory in November and I ask for your vote I'm really asking you to vote for yourself to vote for the people you know and love for the ones you work beside and worship with for the Georgians you may never know but whose faith is undeniably talented to our own these are the people on my mind tonight and that's what will be on my mind every single day as I go to work for you as your next governor hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
