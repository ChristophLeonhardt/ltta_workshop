Germany and Austria agreed to boost the EU border Falls says divisions heightened over immigration is it a sign of increasing or diminishing common ground what extent is the far-right reshaping the bloc's migration policy this is inside story hello and welcome to the show I'm Sam is a Dan well it's an issue that has divided Europe for years undocumented migration almost two million people have risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea since 2014 this movement towards Europe continues to take a devastating toll on human life thousands died during their desperate journey several policies on border control and restrictions have seen a decrease in the number of refugees and migrants but members of the European Union still can't agree on what to do with them Laura Berg manly looks at a polarizing subject within the EU and if common ground can be found 10,000 more troops that's the number of border guards the European Commission is calling on to tackle illegal immigration into Europe an issue that's divided he you members bringing tensions to boiling-point religion unfortunately Stefan has over patient external borders must be protected more effectively so we're proposing that the number of border guards financed by the European budget in 2020 to reach 10,000 the UN High Commissioner for Refugees says refugee and migrant numbers are sharply down from their peak four years ago but the reasons why almost two million migrants have headed to Europe since 2014 remain to escape conflict persecution and economic hardship several far-right leaders in Europe have taken a hard stance on anti immigration including border closure causing many verbal outbursts on Friday Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo salvini exchanged a war of words with a foreign minister of Luxembourg after salvini referred to African migrants as slaves I hear some of my colleagues saying that Europe needs immigrants because its population is ageing but I have a completely different perspective I think I'm a government paid by our citizens to help our young people to start having those children again as they did a few years ago and not to take the best of the Africa to replace europeans who are no longer having children for economic reasons these are two completely different worldviews maybe in Luxembourg there is this need in Italy we feel this need to help our children to have children not the need to have new slaves to replace the children we no longer have so we are really to engage in dialogue with everyone hey there hey there that's going too far I calmly respond to your point of view that it is not my own if you need new immigration in Luxembourg in Italy I prefer to help Italians to start having children again in Luxembourg we had tens of thousands of Italians they came as migrants they worked in Luxembourg so that you and Italy would have the money for your children this drought came after defined Hungarian Prime Minister vowed to contain challenged EU rules on migration this after the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly to trigger for the first time a sanctions procedure against a Member State hungry because of claims it breached EU rules on democracy and civil rights let's speak clearly Hungary is going to be condemned because the Hungarian people have decided that this country is not going to be a country of migrants with due respect but with utmost sincerity I reject that the pro-immigration of pro migrant forces of the European Union should threaten and blackmail and smear Hungary and the Hungarian people based on false allegations EU members agree an urgent overhaul is needed but it divided on what steps need to be taken some countries are pushing for tougher external border controls others for fair distribution of new arrivals a summit between leaders on Sunday will prove if cooler heads can prevail and solve the growing issue or will it continue to deeply divide the EU for inside story Laura Baron Manley al Jazeera well that's bringing our guests into the show we have joining us from Berlin Torsten Benna the co-founder and director of the global public policy Institute in Paris xem salon Amy policy advisor at the European Parliament and in Swindon in the United Kingdom via Skype Mariana kérékou lackey a researcher on migration and co-editor of critical perspectives on migration in the 21st century a warm welcome to everyone in the show if I could start with Torsten then so the leaders of Austria and Germany they want to focus on boosting Frontex we're told is the border the European Union border force a solution to the migration challenge I mean that's the centrist hope mrs. Merkel has adjusted her views and is very much in line now with the Austrian what the austrian chancellor sebastian court said is that hope well place that we need to secure no i think it's a reasonable compromise but we shouldn't have any illusions because the far right or the authoritarian nationalist starting with mr. Orban mr. salvini the people we've heard about just now they have no interest whatsoever to solve the issue of migration the issue of migration for them is an important rallying cry to fuel their authoritarian nationalist revolution or counter-revolution that they're staging in Europe against the values of 1968 that meaning a more open diverse Europe and the values of 1989 an authoritarian revolt against liberal democracy which became the currency for the continent Tolson let me jump in if I may in probably the counter-argument that they would make is that since the European Union can't come up with any sort of common policy to deal with this issue why should countries on the periphery shoulder the burden alone so to speak exactly there was a lot yes in the complaints about from Italy for that have been well founded we left them alone there was a lot of hypocrisy on the part of Germany leaving Italy to deal with Arrivals that's all fair and fine but now that we've come around and said like we want to boost external border protection that should be a consensus thing mr. Orban said oh I don't like the idea of having frontex with all this mandate and people and manpower I I want my own border guards to have sovereignty and and so on so he he makes this sovereigntist counter argument against a coherent European approach to border protection just because he wants to safeguard his own little interests and he wants to keep this divisive issue alive because this divisive issue is important for him because he wins elections on his liberal xenophobic anti-muslim platform and the worst thing that could happen to mr. Albin would be that we have in quotation marks dealt with the migration issue or the the the refugee issue and it's no longer the dominant issue of the day he has a he has a vested interest in keeping it like that that's why he doesn't support a sensible approach all right you you I think you put your finger in a very important point that is the divisions within New Yor want to come to that in a moment but before we get into that I want to ask champs the other sort of major policy push was supposed to be not only on supporting Frontex but opening up new processing centers cooperating with North African countries in trying to stop people coming to Europe do you think that sort of approach can help I mean hello everyone I totally agree with what has been just said and your question on the new hubs that EU member states are trying to at least create in theory stumbles upon a main obstacle which is that on the southern tip of the Mediterranean we have Libya Libya doesn't have a political solution yet and as as long as Libya's own structured institutions do not exist we cannot rely on any partnership and so you know many people might believe that the EU is concretely actually thinking of having hubs in in Libya but in practice there are no such centers funded by the EU let me give me for interrupting at the UN let me represent to you the counter narrative to that as well amongst the particularly the right in the in Europe right now is that why should Europe be responsible for the political structures of other countries isn't it enough to open up processing centers as long as standards are maintained there and there in line with European values you know Europe can't be responsible for the entire political structures in the rest of the world you know with the political analysts in the Middle East and the amount of refugees hosted by the Lebanese the Turks the Jordanians the Iraqis from Syria is absolutely incomparable with the 1 million representing only 0.4% of the US population that EU has welcomed so I think that we shouldn't actually ban the to the rhetoric and smear mongering made by the far-right basically we should actually stand by our reason stand by the the statistics that show that refugees on that many migrants on that many they're actually an economic benefit to us as long as we invest in them and most importantly they are not a security threat this is the most important message that Europeans need to understand 250 days before European elections more and more Europeans under actually believe the far rights ideas that there is an actual link between being a foreigner being a Syrian refugee or Muslim and being a threat to public order and that has been proven wrong not by myself but by the intelligence services of Germany by the French police we can definitely see statistically that a refugee is as dangerous as a standard European you can be good you can be bad that is not the issue and as long as else what about all about the understand that the policy of just allowing in large groups of people may not need the economic in to meet the economic interests of countries like Germany that while these economies do need people to make up gaps in their workforce they should be choosing the more skilled labor and the types of people that are really needed rather than just allowing everybody in so to speak well interestingly the European Parliament has already suggested to answer your question a very strong EU position welcoming migrants on specific conditions which or that they're stationed go to places that actually have jobs that goes without saying and this is the current connection time system in in Germany whereby a refugee is going to be sent to a land a region in Germany that actually has economic prosperity not to zaxon where you have neo-nazi protests at Norman because we know that Saxon is struggling at the moment economically so we actually have the solutions the European Parliament has a ready position itself for family reunification and automatic redistribution of asylum seekers across the EU however our own member states are blocked why because of the minority of foreign governments which as our previous speaker just said or basically I can't looking over any answer Toki for talking about our previous speaker I do want to bring Mariana in but I can see toastin is shaking his head in disagreement so bear with us for a for a minute Mariana and let me give toast in a quick 30 seconds to come in just just two quick ones I think you misrepresented the German system because asylum seekers are distributed across the country we according to a certain scheme but people go to section II as well as other parts regardless of the prosperity of the region so they're distributed everywhere and more importantly I think is really really really important to to make a strong division between our dividing line between those who we want to attract because they we think they should become part of our workforce and we should have regular immigration laws for that and those who come in because they're needy because they need protection because they're they have the status of refugees I think it does a profound disservice to the debate if we mix the two arguments there should be one track that should be for economic migration and we should have all sorts of criteria for that and there should be another track preferably via direct resettlement there should be four people in needs who need protection but we should really make a difference between these two ways of coming to Europe that's a very important distinction of course a lot of the people who at the height of 2015 were entering into Europe at least a sizable portion no doubt were escaping from countries in conflicts to clarify I am presenting as I said the counter-narrative of the right wing without that necessarily meaning that's what I believe and I'm glad it's provoking a good debate and different response from our panelists here let me move to Marianna then shams kind of touched on an important point he hinted at the numbers of people coming to Europe have declined since 2015 one would think that this problem should be decreasing wire divisions heightening only further right now in the European Union over it the numbers have declined but they haven't stopped and we have noticed the past couple of weeks for example in Greece they are rising again and last week and 519 people have arrived this is something that triggers the far-right and because as previous speaker said they use migration for their political gains they don't really care about stopping migration or doing or finding a solution to migration they're using this issue to gain votes in internally and possibly in the in the European for the European election as well that that's so what's happening Maryana do you think too that June agreement that was announced where supposedly you leaders have come to an agreement on voluntary processing centers inside and outside the EU voluntary sort of quotas for settlements of refugees it's all of that over Brea what are we seeing the unofficial demise of that agreement and a descent into what if we are I think yes because they did announce this chasing centers but half of the European country said that they will not accept these centers and where will they build them will be Libya it's impossible with what's going on Egypt I don't think that they will accept or they said that they will not accept will they make more similar centers in the Aegean islands I don't think that there is any more capacity in the Aegean Island and what about maybe they will do them in Turkey but I don't think that anyone can come cooperate with Turkey so I think this disagreement has failed and one of the reasons that they will have an unofficial summit in a couple of days is to discuss and your plan so we will have to wait and see what this new plan will be but possibly they will try to expand the Frontex mandate even even further okay I can see shemp's wants to say something let me give him a chance to come in before I move on yes I just wanted to add on this that actually we already have a system of hubs where migrants in Jordan in Turkey get visits from the EU from Germany from Canada according within the framework of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights you're and within that framework dozens of thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees have been relocated from Jordan or from Lebanon or from Turkey to the EU or to Canada that already exists and the main issue that we're discussing is is not creating new hubs where that is not absolutely not possible in Libya the main issue is actually addressing the relocation within the EU how do we effectively enforce the the basics of the u treaties which say that every member state has to show solidarity and share the burden and therefore why does in Austria and definitely actually Austria does but why doesn't Hungary Slovakia Poland apply the basic rules and that is why the UCAN Parliament last Wednesday has as you as you said started the mechanism should actually freeze the voting rights of Hungary as long as it does not respect basically you law okay I'm glad with have come back a full-circle to a point I wanted to raise with Torsten a point you raise Torsten a moment ago the divisions we've seen this sort of a you action parliamentary action against Hungary which Poland is vowing to disrupt any sort of sanctions against Hungary we've seen hungry make similar pledges to protect Poland we've seen Italy's Interior Minister say sanctions against Hungary would be crazy so there's kind of like the stream of countries lining up on one side and then you have on the other perhaps Luxembourg and France are these disagreements over immigration forging new alliances and creating new divisions within the EU in you have a division between centrist forces that includes the European People's Party that voted against mr. Orban that until now is still a member and the Social Democrats the Liberals and you have the author Terry initialised and there they feel that they have a lot going for them and mr. Albin mr. salvini they've now vowed to form form and anti-european Pro nationalist Pro authoritarian alliance so it's not necessarily it's is new division will redefine the EU break it up I mean where do you see this going it will mess with you you will make policy maybe in policymaking in the u.s. getting more complicated by the day so it will turn the u Parliament depending on the outcome of the elections into a very big acrimonious mess and they will you know they will like that they will relish that is these right-wing forces because they want give me one example to fail the please go ahead go ahead go against you know the yeah chance please yes I was saying can I give you an example so as I have worked in the European Parliament for for a number of politicians from Germany and the UK and France you can see that the far I and in the current mandate has been very destructive in its attempt to derail legislation so for example helping out Syrian refugee children in Turkey by giving them funds to have schools and teachers and better living conditions so that they do not actually try to leave Turkey today I have actually a better future would sound like a very logical solution well you kept the fire out in the UK as well as the fire out in other land in other countries such as in the Netherlands voted against increasing EU funding to build schools for Syrian refugee children in Turkey just because they're racist and that kind of to get the counter-argument I think they say they racist but you see better things to do with EU taxpayer money just to put the counter-argument again not necessarily what I subscribe to but they need to have a majority for that tolson let's give champs 20 seconds to come back in on that and then we're sorry sorry I mean regarding taxpayers money they've done the worst disservice to the UK by pushing it on the cliff edge by brexit you know that is going to cause the UK and has already started to cause the UK a lot of money so I don't get listen and have any economic question from you Kip okay Tolson let me give you a brief 20 seconds we need to get Mariana in again just I mean I think after May they will have the numbers to be really destructive and blocking things right now we haven't seen much yet but it's also really important the action against Hungary that we've seen and against Poland on article 7 is not on their stance on migration and lack of solidarity the action is actually on their stance undermining an independent judiciary independent universities these are all laws that Hungary and Poland have passed that the U has taken issue with because it's against the mutually agreed values this is not a procedure that deals with immigration so we need to get this trip alright so Tolson they're saying that they'll have the real numbers to be destructive after May Mariana I wonder if you agree with this statement by Italy's Minister of Interior Matteo salvini which I think kind is related to what Torsten is is hinting at here when he said quote I am convinced that in a few months we are going to govern Europe together with all ban referring of course the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban rather than a breakup might it take over beyond the cards no I don't agree with that we will see in order to say something final we will have to wait for the elections but two countries cannot rule over the whole European Union so we will have to see maybe my Poland is on the same side you know maybe more than a few countries now which are shifting towards the right wing that might be able to redefine the whole essence of what it means to be the EU they are shifting to the right wing but I don't think that they are shifting to fascism like Hungary and Italy and they they you must change anyway it has it has turned into a right-wing organization I would say but there are still some country when it comes to migration I should note but there there are some countries that will still try to fight the rise of fascism for example France so what I'm saying in Europe at the moment is to poll it's the French poll and the Hungarian poll and we will have to wait until the elections to make some final remarks and conclusions all right I guess time will tell and we will see and no doubt will be back again to discuss this for now I'm afraid time is out so let's thank our guests Torsten Benna Shamsul economy and Mariana karoku lucky and thank you too for watching you can see the show again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com or for further discussion head over to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story can also join the conversation on twitter our handle very at age a inside story from me Sam is a that of the whole team here for now it's goodbye you you
