I want to tell you a great story about Natalie Portman I know that some people have mixed feelings about it but I think that she took a brave an important stand she was set to be honored in Israel with a Genesis prize and she has decided that she is not going to travel to Israel to accept that prize and this led to a misinformation campaign by the right-wing government of Israel that is not at all surprising it is that government that she is protesting anyway and so we had a statement out by Miri Regev Israel's Minister of Culture and sport he said I was saddened to hear that Natalie Portman has fallen as a ripe fruit in the hands of the BDS supporters now that is not true as Natalie Portman clarified it's also a weird way to describe it and as usual with most of the right-wing whether they're here in America or in Israel weirdly insulting oh and they do it over and over again if you're not familiar the BDS movement is boycott divestment and sanctions movement against Israel people have different thoughts on that a lot of folks in Israel and not just the right wing the right wing despises it but a lot of folks in Israel are concerned about that I understand why you'd be concerned if there was a movement to boycott the whole country on the other hand things that work usually involve financial incentives and disincentives so if you don't like the analogy that's okay buckle up for example in apartheid what work was sanctions because in South Africa you did not have a king or a ruler like Saddam Hussein or Kim Jong moon if you have a ruler like that they don't care what happens to their people in South Africa you had more diffuse power that you had a ruling class in essence and they were made up of business leaders and when those business leaders got hurt financially they got rid of apartheid and that doesn't mean that what Israel is doing is apartheid arguments can certainly be made but it does mean financial incentives and disincentives work when you have a situation like Israel they do not have a king they do not have some sort of dictator no they have relative democracy certainly not for the Palestinians living in the occupied territories under occupation but they do within Israel proper and they have a diffuse power base and if you were to do sanctions and boycotts it might work and that is exactly what the ruling class is worried about in Israel so they panic over this now Natalie Portman came out and clarified her position she said my decision not to attend the Genesis Prize ceremony has been mischaracterized by others let me speak for myself I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony by the same token I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it now some will say well she didn't go far enough she should endorse PDS but that's her opinion in her position and she's born in Israel obviously his friends family there etc and that's the decision she gets to make and so on the other hand not going to get the award cuz you're gonna be on the same stage as Netanyahu and you don't want to be on the same stage as him that's a wonderful statement that is someone taking a bold stance to fight against the corruption of Netanyahu fighting against the right-wing policies of Netanyahu and and that does resonate I think across the world so I want to celebrate that I want to give you one more quote from the rest of Natalie Portman his message she said I treasure my Israeli friends and family Israeli food books art cinema and dance Israel was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for refugees from the Holocaust but the mistreatment of those suffering from today's atrocities is simply not in line with my Jewish values because I care about Israel I must stand up against violence corruption inequality and abuse of power oh I love that statement that's exactly right because if you care about Israel and you care about those values that a lot of us do care about then you have to fight for justice you have to fight for equality for everyone you have to try to end the occupation that has gone on for so long and has not made Israel any safer and you've got I mean go to a Passover dinner look at the toes here the toes absorb that it's actually wonderful but we got to live by that Creed and we and we've got to fight in that direction and this is Natalie Portman's way of fighting in that direction I think it's brave I think it's fantastic and I need should be celebrated if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm slash joy
