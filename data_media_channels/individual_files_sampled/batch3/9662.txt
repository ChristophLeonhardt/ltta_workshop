WE'LL BE WATCHING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE PLANNING A MEETING WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN. THIS IS AFTER THE EXPLOSIVE NEW YORK TIMES REPORT CLAIMING ROSENSTEIN SPOKE ABOUT RECORDING PRESIDENT TRUMP. JOINING ME KNOW IS TREY, HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OVER SITE COMMITTEE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU CONGRESSMAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE BETWEEN THE MEETING OF ROSENSTEIN AND PRESIDENT. WELL, I WANT TO SEE THE MEMOS. I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO INJURY JOURNALISM SCHOOL. YOU NEED AN ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION TO READ THE MANY MOMENTS DESPITE THE FACT CONGRESS HAS BEEN ASKING FOR IT FOR MONTHS. I NEED TO SEE THE MEMOS AND ASK ROAD WHAT HE SAID AND MEANT. LINDSEY GRAHAM IS RIGHT WHEN YOU STAR WITNESS IS MCCABE IS IS IN TROUBLE FOR LACK OF CANDOR AND AFFIRMATIVELY MISREPRESENT MISREPRESENTING THE TRUTH. I APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT TALKING TO HIM THIS WEEK. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAID AND MEANT. I WANT TO KNOW WHO ELSE WAS PRESENT FOR THE MEETING. THIS IS THE REASON YOUR COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT WENT INTO THE WHOLE NARRATIVE OF DONALD TRUMP HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH WE HAVE NEWS ON - HAVE NEWS ON HAVE NEWS ON MVE NEWS ON MED NEWS ON MEDALEWS ON MEDALINS ON MEDALING.ON MEDALING.LET'S TALK ABOUT WA MEDALING.LET'S TALK ABOUT WT MEDALING.LET'S TALK ABOUT WW MEDALING.LET'S TALK ABOUT WE MEDALING.LET'S TALK ABOUT WS RUSSIA METALING. MEDALING.LET'S TALK ABOUT WE FROM THE DOCUMENTS. AS COLLUSION COORDINATION, ENGINEER JAGINEER JARENEER JAREDEER JAREDKUR JAREDKUSHNER TO EVERYONE INVOLVE EVERY SINGLE WITNESS FROM JAREDKUSHNER TO EVERYONE INVOLV. I WANT VIEWERS TO SEE EVERY QUESTION. THEY WERE INTERESTED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AS ANY ONE ELSE. WHAT THEY WILL ALSO LEARN IS ADAM WANTED TO GO BACK 25 YEARS AND ASK QUESTIONS OF WITNESSES WHILE IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. THEN HE GOES AND GET NOTES FROM THE BROTHERS AND DECIDES TO OMINOUS SOUNDING RUSSIAN NAMES THAT NONE OF THE WITNESSES HEARD OF. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE TRANSPORTATIONS TO COME OUT AND DEFEAT THE NARRATIVE THAT HE'S THE ONLY ONE CONCERNED ABOUT COLLUSION. IF THERE WERE EVIDENCE ADAM WOULD HAVE LEAKED IT A LONG TIME AGO. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE TRANSPORTATIONS TO BECOME PUBLIC. THEY VOTED ON FRIDAY MORNING TO DECLASSIFY THE TRANSPORTATIONS OF INTERVIEWS OF MORE THEN 50 WITNESSES. HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE GIVE THE DOJ AND FBI THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR DOCUMENTS FOR OVER A YEAR. I'VE SEEN ALMOST EVERY DOCUMENT THEY WILL ALLOW CONGRESS TO SEE. PAUL AND DEVIN HAVE BEEN GOOD ABOUT LETTING ME GO TO THE DEPARTMENT. I USED TO WORK THERE. I UNDERSTAND THE TENSION BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THINK BACK TO THE COMBY MEMOS. ONLY TWO OF US COULD READ THEM AND COULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM. THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY ARE IN EVERY MAJOR NEWS PAPER AND YOU WONDER, WHY COULDN'T I READ THIS SIX MONTHS AGO. I WONDER IF THIS IS TRUE WITH THE MCCABE MEMOS. I THINK WHAT MY FELLOW CITIZENS WILL SEE THE DEPARTMENT AND BUREAU HIDE BEHIND AN ONGOING CRIMINAL PROBE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT US TO SEE THINGS THAT ARE EMBARRASSING FOR THEM. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND A FEW BAD ACTORS. I'VE WORKED WITH THEM FOR 20 YEARS. THERE ARE 1,000 PEOPLE YOU WOULD LOVE. PETER HAD HIS HAND ON THE I'M BACK WITH THE CONGRESSMAN. I ASKED YOU THIS QUESTION BEFORE WE WENT TO BREAK AND THAT WAS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. WE UNDERSTAND THEIR HAVE BEEN A LOT OF LEAKS TO THE MEDIA AND THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW, IS IT NOT? I WOULD LIKE YOUR VIEWERS TO THINK ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT TRACKS. THEY HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. THAT'S NOT CRIMINAL BUT A MORAL ISSUE. THE LEGAL ISSUE IS WHEN YOU DIS LEAK INFORMATION. THE OTHER IS WHAT LINDSEY REFERRED TO. WHEN YOU TELL A WITNESS, LIKE HOPE HICKS, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED YOU. WHILE HER INTERVIEW WAS GOING ON THE DEMOCRATS WERE COORDINATING WITH THE MEDIA. SELECTING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF HER TESTIMONY AND LEAKING IT. IT'S NOT A CRIMINAL ISSUE BE YOU MORAL ISSUE. IT DESTROYS TRUST. IT'S WHY CONGRESS IS BROKEN. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD GO TO JAIL FOR. I'M TALKING ABOUT LEAKING BY COMBY. I'M TALKING ABOUT SHIFT WHO LEAKED INFORMS TO THE NEW YORK TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST. IT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. CONGRESS DOESN'T INVESTIGATE CRIME. LEAKING IS MORAL. DISPENSING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS A CRIME. CONGRESS DOESN'T INVESTIGATE, PROSECUTE SENATES FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. WILL WE SEE ACCOUNTABILITY IN ALL OF THIS. YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE INVESTIGATORS FOR A WHILE NOW. THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT DID SOMETHING WRONG. TELL US WHERE YOU SEE THIS GOING? THERE HAS BEEN SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE IS MORE TO COME. I THINK OF THE TEN PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA PROBE. 80% OF THEM ARE NO LONGER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OR BUREAU. YOU MENTION MCCABE, COMBY IS GONE, JIM BAKER IS GONE. THERE HAS BEEN SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. I THINK THERE WOULD BE MORE IF THE DEMOCRATS SPENT MORE TIME WORKING WITH THEIR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND MORE TIME WITH MEDIA LEAKS. THAT'S MY FLUSTRATION. THE DEPARTMENT BELONGS TO ALL OF US. DEMOCRATS ALIKE WOULDEN LIKE BIAS FBI AGENTS. WHO WALLED HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PETER TO FIND A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT THEY LIKED. ALL OF THE TIMES THEY ARE CRITICAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DEFEND ONE OF THE MOST BIAS AGENTS IN PUBLIC SERVICE. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND WHY I
