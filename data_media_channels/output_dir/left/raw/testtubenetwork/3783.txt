00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,870
In the wake of the recent tragedy in Marysville,
Washington, many websites and pundits are

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,509
calling out the high number of School Shootings
that have happened since Sandy Hook. Many

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:15,409
claim that there have been 87 school shootings
since december 2012; a number that’s both

4
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:17,390
alarming, and misleading.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,920
When we hear “school shooting” we generally
think of a person entering campus with the

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,690
intent to kill or injure numerous students.
We think of tragedies like Columbine, Virginia

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,000
Tech

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,279
and Sandy Hook. Since December 2012, there
have been 11 of these types of school shootings

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,719
- meaning 11 times, in the United States,
gunmen have fired upon multiple people, on

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,199
school

11
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:43,480
property, with the intent to kill or injure.
That is a shocking number. But it’s also

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,249
way less than

13
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:49,390
the 87 times the media is reporting. So, what
makes up those 76 other incidents?

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,679
Well, the number being quoted comes from a
non-profit group called Everytown For Gun

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,989
Safety. Their goal is to end gun violence.
The majority of shootings that they’re categorizing

16
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:00,569
as

17
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:04,459
“school shootings” are shootings that
happen at or near schools, but they’re not

18
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:04,979
what you tend

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,280
to think of when you hear the term “school
shooting.” For instance, their list includes

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,650
a man who

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,650
was murdered at night behind a school, a teenager
shot on a school basketball court during

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,560
a weekend pickup game, and spontaneous shootings
that stemmed from arguments, fights,

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,400
and drug deals. It also includes suicides,
attempted suicides, domestic assaults, premeditated

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,180
murders, robberies, and accidental gun discharges.
All of these are serious events that bring

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,320
up

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,560
separate issues. But they don’t bring up
the same issues or emotions, that a school

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:36,910
shooting

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,640
like Sandy Hook or Columbine does.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,780
The fact that there have been 11 tragedies
like Sandy Hook, and not 87, doesn’t change

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:44,920
the

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,740
way we feel about these tragedies. Eleven
shootings in less than two years, is still

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,500
a shockingly

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,780
high incident rate. But we also shouldn‘t
discount the 76 other incidents. They all

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,670
matter. And

35
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,420
by not lumping them all together, we can address
a wider range of issues. What should we be

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,380
doing about gun safety? Or teen suicide? Or
domestic abuse? What can we do to keep drugs

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,000
and crime out of our classrooms? How can we
deal with teenage anger? Or staff burnout?

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
By

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,260
focusing on the specifics, we may be able
to prevent the next school shooting, but we

40
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,920
can also address these other problems, too.
Plus, releasing a statement saying there

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,970
have been 87 school shootings creates more
debate about the specific number and less

42
00:02:26,970 --> 00:00:00,000
about the actual problems.
