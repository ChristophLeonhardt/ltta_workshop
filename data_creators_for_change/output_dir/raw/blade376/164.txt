1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
so when I was in stick form doing

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,100
biology I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a video with the</font>

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,010
class sitting at the back of the room on

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,490
animal reproduction great so being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,410
clown of the class I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sitting at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,410
back making I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think witty</font>

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,660
remarks but probably if I actually

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,580
rewatched what I said then it probably

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,570
wasn't witty at all and this old man who

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,369
was presenting the show was talking

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,189
about animal reproduction and I just

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,190
said out loud ha as if he would know

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,010
about having<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex and then the guy in</font>

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,250
front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me he turned round and he said</font>

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,350
that's my uncle and the whole room just

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,719
stared at<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in complete silence and I</font>

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,390
thought what are the chances of that and

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,129
I'm sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all have stories in</font>

19
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,460
life where we maybe do something trying

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be funny or clever or try and do the</font>

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,438
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and it turns out not to go</font>

22
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,299
the way you've had it planned and you

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,470
always end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> going what were the</font>

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,270
chances of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so with that story</font>

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,580
coming to mind I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if any of</font>

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,670
you guys had<font color="#CCCCCC"> any stories where you asked</font>

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that same question</font>
