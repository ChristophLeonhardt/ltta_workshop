00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:05,610
TURNING POINTS U.S.A.'S CANDACE

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,947
OWENS WITH THE MOST OF

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:15,753
MINE AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD WAS

4
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:16,354
QUITE EVENTFUL.

5
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:19,424
AND A MESSAGE FOR WHOOPI

6
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,526
GOLDBERG ON WHAT HAPPENED IN

"THE VIEW" THIS WEEK COMING UP

8
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:25,263
LATER IN THE SHOW.

9
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:27,398
EVERY WEEK I DO AN OPENING

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,200
STATEMENT ON WHATEVER IT IS THAT

11
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,635
HAS ME FIRED UP.

12
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,844
BARELY ONE, WE ARE GOING UP TO

13
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:40,512
4.

14
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:43,515
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, 89

15
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:49,420
IF DEMOCRATS DON'T GET THEIR YOU

16
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,931
>> DID YOU JUST POINT AT ME?

17
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:03,168
I DON'T HAVE TRUMP DERANGEMENT.

18
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,736
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE.

19
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:06,804
I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE STARTING A

20
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:08,840
CONVERSATION WITH MEXICANS ARE

21
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:11,910
LIARS AND RAPISTS.

22
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,478
I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE STARTING A

23
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,514
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.

24
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:18,216
I'M 62 YEARS OLD.

25
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:19,350
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE

26
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,553
IN OFFICE I DIDN'T AGREE WITH.

27
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:26,491
BUT I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN

28
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:28,426
ANYBODY LIKE THIS.

29
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:30,795
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY WHIP

30
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:33,531
UP SUCH HATE AND BE SO

31
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:34,232
DISMISSIVE.

32
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:40,338
SUFFER FROM THAT.

33
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:43,608
WAY SUFFER FROM IS THE INABILITY

34
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,410
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX THIS.

35
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,678
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU TALK

36
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,680
ABOUT A LOT AND I'M CURIOUS BY

37
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,315
THE IS THE DEEP STATE.

38
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:52,150
HOW LONG HAS THE DEEP STATE BEEN

39
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,253
THERE AND WHO IS RUNNING IT.

40
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:57,589
>> I WANT TO SCANS YOUR

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,690
QUESTION.

42
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:00,425
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT HOW

43
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,899
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,335
YOU SAID -- YOU'VE SAID THEY END

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,313
THINK ABOUT IT.

46
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:24,616
JUDGE JEANINE: AFTER THAT IT WAS

47
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:27,485
CURSED AT AND I AND MY TEAM WERE

48
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,257
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD.

49
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:40,565
FOR ME, I'M A BIG GIRL AND I

50
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,501
WOULD GO BACK ON "THE VIEW"

51
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:43,801
AGAIN.

52
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:46,871
BUT MORE ON THIS ISSUE,

53
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:48,940
SPECIFICALLY TO WHOOPI WHO I

54
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:51,342
HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS.

55
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,810
THERE IS A BIGGER ISSUE OF THAT

56
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,580
PLAY HERE.

57
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,815
"THE VIEW" IS A MICROCOSM OF

58
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:59,917
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY.

59
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:03,354
THE LEVEL OF HATRED TOWARD THE

60
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:07,258
HAVE SEEN IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

61
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:14,265
BY POLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES OF

62
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,535
THE AISLE, SPORTS FIGURES AND

63
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:18,970
EVEN THE MEDIA.

64
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,872
THEN HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT.

65
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:23,908
NOW DONALD TRUMP IS THE TARGET

66
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,111
OF VITRIOL SO PALPABLE IT'S

67
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:29,380
SIMPLY FRIGHTENING AND REASON

68
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:35,186
ANYMORE AND THE RIPPLE ITS

69
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,521
NATIONAL IN SCOPE.

70
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:38,956
FAMILY, FRIEND, ACQUAINTANCES

71
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,392
CAN'T EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER.

72
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,728
THEY REMOVE EACH OTHER FROM

73
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,963
FACEBOOK AND CHANGE DINNER AND

74
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:48,232
FAMILY GATHERING PLANS FOR THE

75
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:49,434
HOLIDAYS DEPENDING ON THEIR

76
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,635
POLITICS.

77
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:52,603
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A

78
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:06,284
PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE FACE.

79
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,586
WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO PUNCH HIM

80
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,790
DEBATE THIS GENTLEMAN.

81
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,492
I SAID NO IF I WERE IN HIGH

82
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:16,394
SCHOOL I WOULD TAKE HIM BEHIND

83
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,528
THE GYM AND BEAT THE HELL OUT OF

84
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:18,795
HIM.

85
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:20,898
>> WHEN IS THE LAST TIME AN

86
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,400
ACTOR ASSASSINATED A PRESIDENT.

87
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:25,403
>> YES, I HAVE THOUGHT AN AWFUL

88
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:28,439
LOT ABOUT BLOWING UP THE WHITE

89
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:28,740
HOUSE.

90
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,675
JESSE: THAT'S NOT ALL.

91
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:32,443
WHEN A MEMBER OF CONGRESS CAN

92
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:34,312
SAY THIS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WORK

93
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:37,315
FOR AND SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT WE

94
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:41,519
HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IN AMERICA.

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,521
>> YOU HAVE MEMBERS OF YOUR

96
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:45,990
CABINET THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN

97
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:50,161
OUT OF RESTAURANTS.

98
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:53,364
YOU HAVE PROTESTS AT THEIR

99
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:54,332
HOUSE.

100
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,635
IF YOU SEE ANYBODY FROM THAT

101
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,704
CABINET IN A RESTAURANT, IN A

102
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:03,107
DEPARTMENT STORE, AT A GASOLINE

103
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:03,775
STATION.

104
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:06,544
YOU GET OUT AND YOU CREATE A

105
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:08,246
CROWD.

106
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:11,549
AND YOU TELL THEM THEY ARE NOT

107
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,853
WELCOME ANYMORE ANYWHERE.

108
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:18,189
JUDGE JEANINE: NOT WELCOME

109
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,856
ANYMORE ANYWHERE.

110
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:26,464
WHEN WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

111
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:28,299
SARAH SANDERS NEEDS SECRET

112
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,534
SERVICE PROTECTION BECAUSE SHE

113
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:30,968
SPEAKS FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE

114
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:31,969
UNITED STATES, SOMETHING IS

115
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:32,637
WRONG.

116
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:34,539
WHEN WE GET SCREAMED AT EVEN

117
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,275
BEFORE WE GIVE AN OPINION,

118
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:42,580
PEOPLE DOWN, WHEN IT'S

119
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,316
ACCEPTABLE TO NOT HEAR WHAT

120
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:48,186
PEOPLE THINK, THAT'S THE FIRST

121
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:51,756
STEP TO WHERE WE DON'T THINK.

122
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:53,991
THINKING YOU ARE RIGHT AND NOT

123
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,164
OR REPUBLICAN.

124
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:03,234
OR THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT, IT'S

125
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:03,901
WRONG.

126
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:10,308
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SUCCESS

127
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:12,610
OF OUR NATION.

128
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:14,111
I LIVED THROUGH 8 YEARS OF

129
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:14,712
BARACK OBAMA.

130
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:17,348
A LOT OF YOU HEARD MY OPEN.

131
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,284
I AM VERY CLEAR IN MY OBJECTION

132
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:23,421
TO HIS POLICIES, BUT I NEVER

133
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:25,122
ROOTED FOR AMERICA TO FAIL.

134
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,792
THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD ALL

135
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:30,895
WANT AND THAT NO ONE WOULD BE

136
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:33,564
AGAINST SIMPLY DON'T MATTER

137
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:33,898
ANYMORE.

138
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,436
THE ECONOMY SOARING.

139
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:39,804
SIGHS  * DEFEATED.

140
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:42,306
TAX CUTS FOR EVERYONE.

141
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:43,975
THEY DON'T SEEM TO MATTER IF

142
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:45,743
IT'S UNDER THIS PRESIDENT.

143
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:54,452
>> I FEEL LIKE THE BOTTOM HAS TO

144
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:55,920
FALL OUT AT SOME POINT AND BY

145
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:58,256
THE WAY I'M HOPING FOR IT.

146
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:06,964
SORRY IF IT HURTS PEOPLE.

147
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:15,106
JUDGE JEANINE: FOR ALL YOU ON

148
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:17,742
THE LEFT ROOTING AGAINST NAIR

149
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,613
YOURSELF IF YOU THINK WHAT YOU

150
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,315
ARE DOING IS STANDING UP FOR

151
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:24,882
AMERICA.

152
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:30,855
AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU ARE TEARING

153
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:32,356
DOWN SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT

154
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:37,995
YOU ARE TEARING DOWN THE VALUES

155
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:40,731
OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF.

156
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:42,600
EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO SPEAK.

157
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:44,635
BUT WHEN YOU CAN'T ENLIST ON

158
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,572
WHAT SOMEONE HAS TO SAY BECAUSE

159
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,473
YOU DESPISE THE MAN WHO IS

160
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:52,310
PRESIDENT, YOU UNDERMINE NOT THE

161
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,912
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

162
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:59,350
YOU UNDERMINE THE UNITED STATES.

163
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:04,789
AND THAT'S MY OPEN.

164
00:08:04,790 --> 00:00:00,000
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ON MY
