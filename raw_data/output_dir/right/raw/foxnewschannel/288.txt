00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,472
ONE THING THAT STRIKES ME AS

78
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,107

ABORTION OF COURSE.

ABORTION BUT IT'S INSANE.

95
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,729

00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:52,732
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN THAT WILL

117
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,235
MAKE US FORGET THE KAVANAUGH

118
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:56,969

THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR SO MANY

125
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,951

126
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:12,552
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, THE

127
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,488

RIGHT NOW, IT'S AMAZING TO ME

130
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,026
BUT ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, YOU

131
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,764
HAVE 70    70% OF AMERICANS WHO

132
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,968
SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL.

133

SOMETHING LIKE OBAMACARE, I'M

135
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,438
SURE ANY FOX VIEWER REMEMBERS

136
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,973
THAT OBAMACARE WAS TERRIBLE.

137
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,642
NOW IT HAS THE MAJORITY OF THE

154
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,238
IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOUR PHONE

155
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,073
EXCEPT THE STUFF ON YOUR PHONE

156
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,074

YOU SAID ABOUT USA TODAY.

159
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:18,251
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

160
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:22,722
HE DOES HAVE A GIFT FOR MAKING

161
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,256
BIG, BOLD CONTRAST.

162
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,591
HE IS SETTING THIS UP, AMERICA

163
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,093
RESERVES VENEZUELA.

164
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,494
CAPITALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM.

165
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,262
GREATNESS VERSUS MISERY AND IT'S

166
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,864
NOT JUST A GOOD MIDTERM MESSAGE,

167
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,732
IT'S A GOOD GENERAL ELECTION

168
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,834
MESSAGE.

169
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,702
ONCE THE DEMOCRATS GOT THEIR

170
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,370
CLAWS INTO HEALTH CARE, NOT

171
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,170
GOING TO STOP AND LISTEN TO WHAT

172
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,672
THEY SAY.

173
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,574
THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT CAPPING

174
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,075
CEO SALARIES.

175
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:43,676

GUARANTEEING HOUSING IS A RIGHT.

177
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:49,782
THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT UNIVERSAL

CARBON TAX.

182
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,157
THERE'S A LOT OF SOCIALIST IDEAS

183
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,358
THEY ARE KICKING AROUND WHICH

184
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,027
ARE VERY DANGEROUS AND IF THE

GROWTH IS GOING TO SLOW DOWN.

190
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,972
INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO SLOW

191
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:13,773
DOWN.

192
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,507
ENTREPRENEURSHIP'S ARE GOING TO

193
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:14,874
SLOW DOWN.

194
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,475
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DANGEROUS.

195
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,878
IT'S A GOOD MESSAGE GOING INTO

196
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,412
THE MIDTERMS.

197
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,579
>> Greg: DANA, I KNOW YOU HAVE

198
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,882
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY.

199
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,750
DO YOU THINK CNN GOT A MEMO

200
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,020
ABOUT THE MOB?

201
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,156
THE M WORD.

202
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:30,823
>> Dana: IT'S NOT JUST CNN.

203
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,957
IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD ON THE

204
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,826
LEFT BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED IS

205
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,194
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THE ABILITY

206
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:39,198
TO MAKE THE CONTRAST AND HE HAS

207
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,032
THE LEFT ON DEFENSE.

208
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,034
THEY ARE ON THEIR HEELS.

209
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,969
YOU HAVE THIS IDEA, DEMOCRATS ON

210
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,138
EVERY SHOW OR SOCIAL MEDIA, IT'S

211
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,239
NOT A MOB.

212
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,774
WE ARE NOT SOCIALIST.

213
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,910
WE ARE NOT FOR ABOLISHING I.C.E.

214
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,844
THERE IS NO PROACTIVE MESSAGE

215
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,678
THEY CAN GET ACROSS BECAUSE HE

216
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,481
ALWAYS HAS THEM RESPONDING TO

217
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,550
HIM.

218
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:02,154
HE IS ALREADY SETTING UP 2020.

219
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,356
BASICALLY IT'S AMERICA VERSUS

220
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,691
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?

221
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,859
AMERICA VERSUS SOCIALISTS.

222
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,228
IT'S A GREAT CIVICS AND

223
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,098
ECONOMICS LESSON.

224
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,034
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,

225
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,036
OVER 50% OF THE WORLD'S

226
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,571
POPULATION IS MIDDLE-CLASS OR

227
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,271
HIGHER.

228
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,439
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

229
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,576
DIDN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT CAPITALIS

230
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:23,976
CAPITALISM.

231
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:24,710
WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CHANCE

232
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,411
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

233
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,480
>> Juan: I THINK CAPITALISM IS

234
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:27,913
GREAT.

235
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,315
I WAS AT A CEREMONY AT A YOUNG

236
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,083
WOMAN CAME UP AND SAID SOMA

237
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,284
PEOPLE ARE DOWN ON CAPITALISM

238
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,054
BUT THE REALITY IS IF YOU

239
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,422
INVOLVE NOT JUST PROFITS,

240
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,858
QUARTERLY PROFITS, BUT YOU START

241
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,060
TALKING ABOUT STAKEHOLDERS,

242
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:41,794
EMPLOYEES, WORKERS, INVESTORS,

243
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,229
IT HAS MADE US RICHER.

244
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,030
I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE

245
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,399
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF

246
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,634
DRUGS IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE

247
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,137
HIGH COST OF -- WE PAY TWICE AS

248
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,204
MUCH PER CAPITA AS ANY COUNTRY

249
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,974
IN THE WORLD AND YET WE HAVE

250
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,041
30 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE

251
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,110
UNINSURED AND WE KNOW IF YOU GET

252
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,945
IN A BAD ACCIDENT, CAN BE

253
00:07:59,946 --> 00:00:00,000
CATASTROPHIC FOR YOUR ECONOMIC
