Republican lawmakers in the US are threatening to cut funding to the World Health Organisation's cancer research program now this is after the International Agency for research on cancer said that America's most widely used weed killer Mabo Monsanto is probably carcinogenic I arch unsubstantiated claims irx irresponsible handling of data why IARC should receive any government funding in the future they're disputing the organization's findings regarding its leading herbicide called roundup and back in 2015 the International Agency for research on cancer concluded that roundups active ingredient glyphosate could be carcinogenic to humans now roundup is made by Monsanto and it's the world's most widely used weed killer since the 70s it's been sprayed on corn soybeans cotton and other crops and Republicans believe that the study was flawed and relied on cherry-picks science accusing the agency of lack of transparency and anti industry bias they say that if glyphosate is designated as carcinogenic it will require manufacturers and retailers to warn workers and consumers and plus it'll increased costs and instill fear in the public some have disagreed with Republicans it is important that we review the methods and tactics that industry has used to influence this administration and attack independent scientific organizations like the World Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer or IARC I would like to say that fundamentally this hearing is about the ability of a public health agency to call a carcinogen a carcinogen even if that carcinogen makes a huge amount of money for powerful corporations according to the Center for Responsive Politics Monsanto lobbied more than 4.3 million dollars in 2017 the Environmental Protection Agency which is not an international organization concluded that the same ingredient does not cause cancer and IARC says that they've been under attack ever since they publish their conclusions against glyphosate at the same time Monsanto has been pushing against these findings through several different means and the company is seen as well quite controversial not only in the US but all over the world president micron promised in no remember that glyphosate would be banned within three years genetically modified crops have been banned in over 35 different countries but not banned in the u.s. international organizations have concluded that glyphosate could be cancerous so these lawmakers intentions are quite unclear let's bring in de Perkins down as a radio talk-show host and a political commentator good to have you on Dave w-h-o scientist saying that this weed killer the world's most popular probably more likely than not in other words causes cancer republicans don't believe it they say the claims unfounded who do you trust well here's the thing a lot of people don't understand what the ingredient is used for glyphosate roundup is used commercially as a weed killer but in farming terms it's very important for farmers to maximize the money they spend to get the most out of their money when it's harvest time and i am told this by farmers here in texas everybody knows a farmer - so you get the straight scoop from them you're not trying to kill weeds by spraying roundup on crops like corn and wheat and that sort of thing what you're trying to do is rush and hurry the dying of the plants because some plants mature and die which makes them harvestable and others standing right next to them aren't ready to do that yet and to be able to harvest your crop all at the same time it's a big undertaking and they spend a lot of money the need to spray something on them to get them all in the same condition to get them all ready for harvesting is apparent and that's why they picked glyphosate 50 years ago and that's why they've been using it ever since the opposition to it has been largely fringe you know bloggers and people with anecdotal stories to tell people who have a an animus toward major corporations like Monsanto anyway and are coming up with reasons to oppose them but now that American legislators have gotten in on the act it sounds like Monsanto hasn't spent enough money lobbying and hasn't put enough donations in politicians pockets yet or at least in the right ones this is a serious turn for the worse for Monsanto but I'm not sure there is the evidence that everyone wants to see that the substance is plainly carcinogenic to have that much influence you would to have thousands or tens of thousands of cancer cases that were traceable to the use of the product and I'm not sure that kind of evidence exists there's always anecdotal evidence but I'm not sure there's convincing evidence that it is a carcinogen I appreciate that it's a very interesting one as well and it makes me think now the US Environmental Protection Agency said that roundup not likely to be carcinogenic but I suppose the question here is new you know not likely is that good enough I mean should it be shelved until people can find a definitive answer one way or the other or is there just too much at stake here my sense is there isn't enough evidence to lead people to believe that it is outright carcinogenic that the stories are largely anecdotal and there isn't a bulk of data to be analyzed to make that determination and there should be because they've been using it for 50 years and it has been helping reduce the cost of the food that gets delivered to people's tables by harmonizing the harvest time and keeping that expense at a minimum and for that to be halted based on some arm-waving and some accusations of cherry-picking of course Monsanto cherry-picks every corporation protects its product you can't expect them to do otherwise what I'd like to see and I've been looking at this for quite some number of years is the bulk of data that can be analyzed and give you a clear indication that it's carcinogenic and I have not seen that yet and I don't think the law makers are saying they've seen it either they just want to explore the possibilities we've said Republicans are threatening to cut funding from the US for the World Health Organization how do you anticipate the w-h-o to respond to that kind of pressure well when you are uh when you're a politician you have a tool box with only one tool in it and that tool is a hammer and everything looks like a nail when all you've got is a hammer cutting funding is the way that politicians cause people to jump and react and respond and I think there could be I don't want to call it a trade war because it isn't precisely that over trade but there could be some response from Europe shall we say that might not be so good for America this is a the first step on what could be a high escalation and I hate to see what's gonna come from it first please data data first not action first data first yeah upon it there are there possible serious repercussions because you've got the likes of France saying that you know we'll ban this weedkiller could this undermine trust in US products I'm not so assured that doing that to Monsanto undermines trust in general I think the whole world has a habit of not trusting companies like Monsanto already and I don't think public opinion is getting terribly changed by all this it's interesting to watch but I don't see it as a huge crashing wave more like a little bump in the road right now Dave appreciate your time on your views my guest Dave Perkins radio talk show host but it's a commentator thanks thanks Neal now the Republicans seeking to cut funding to the World Health Organization sit on the US House Science Committee but the views expressed by current and former members of the panel have often raised eyebrows we don't know what those other cycles were caused by in the past could be dinosaur flatulence what happened when the co2 was greater since then and now there's been many cycles of up and down warming dinosaur flatulence all this stuff I was taught about evolution numerology Big Bang Theory all that is lies straight okay oh thank about if your ice cube melts in your glass it doesn't overflow it was displacement I mean this is the thing some of the things that they're talking about mathematically and scientifically don't make sense
