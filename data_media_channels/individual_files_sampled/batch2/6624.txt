Garet cones top economic advisor to President Trump he's leaving the sensible reason is he disagrees about the steel and aluminum sign to you when that knows news first broke nobodies nose got broken by the way when the news first broke it's not about that that's what everybody's reporting no there's two reasons why Jericho's leaving one is they already got the tax cuts that's trillions of dollars in tax cuts for corporations of the rich that was his number-one objective steel and aluminum tariffs are tiny in comparison and number two he's getting out before the indictments it's in white house in complete and utter chaos and who the hell wants to stay in that building any longer than they have to and Cohn thinks we're not gonna get anything else done and so I got the tax cuts and I'm Audi 5000 so and this is gonna be his last cabinet meeting so he's sitting on the side because he's not in the camera that he's an advisor but Trump decides that he's gonna say goodbye to him oh don't just be quiet just let it go no instead this this is Gary combs last meeting in the cabinet and of the cabinet and he's been terrific he may be a globalist but I still like it his own way he's an analyst because he loved their country we go out and make another couple of hundred billion and then each year to maybe come back we might come back right we'll be here another seven years hopefully and it's a long time but I have a feeling you'll be back I don't know if I can put in that same position it's not quite as strong with those tariffs what is that that's maniacal okay in case you don't know the other meaning of globalists let's go to Talking Points Memo while the term globalist can refer to a person who advocates for economic and foreign policy in relation to developments throughout the rest of the world the term is more widely considered an anti-semitic dog whistle by the way Gary Cohen is Jewish oops look even if you meant the other version of globalists mm this is the version that is more widely known is widely known I wouldn't have talked about it in reference to a Jewish person who's leaving your administration hey look that's one part of it the second part of it is what are you doing let's just let him go and say thank you for your service instead makes it horribly awkward now he's not on strong night terrors but he'll probably go and come back he'll come back he'll come back in other words dammit I didn't want him to leave and I bet he comes back I bet he does and you make a couple hundred million dollars and come back but that's the problem he was the president of goldman sachs there's a revolving door that's what they call them government sachs they go in they get trillions of dollars in breaks for goldman sachs and their friends which is exactly what Gary Cohen did and then go back out make a couple hundred million dollars more than come back in and rigged the rules again if you're looking for who rigged the rules it's guys like Gary Cohn so I got no love for Gary Cohen but I even I wouldn't have sent him out like that that's just uncalled for you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network com slash join
