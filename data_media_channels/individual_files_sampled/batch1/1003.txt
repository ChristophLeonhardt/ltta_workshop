ranked as the most corrupt Southeast Asian country Cambodia is about to have an election but with the main opposition party banned from participating it's being widely condemned as a sham not that you'll read that in the local press the country's head of Taxation has been accused of forcing the closure of independent media but what has he got to hide I don't want to talk about I'm Steve Chow on

car just before I have a good cause and confortable cars but for now I use the all car and nice maybe niche this wing Cambodia is the failing democracy where one-party state Nally pillows is the director of one of Cambodia's oldest and most respected human rights organizations Lucado if you look closely at some of these parties the other 19 except for one tiny one they're all aligned in some ways and they all popped up recently so this is not a multi-party election this is a non-competitive election the one and only party that Nally pillars says is independent is this one the grassroots democratic party set up in 2015 today its candidates are meeting on the outskirts of per Phnom Penh to talk election strategy pyonium clan could you meet at the Polti Polti Moya canto you saying coma is a party founder and its prime ministerial candidate canto you people get your kinda cramped are you caught law before enquiry the portrait of his party's co-founder is an eerie reminder of just how treacherous Cambodian politics can be in July 2016 Kim Lai was shot dead in a pond on pen cafe one of the country's most fearless critics of the ruling party he's widely believed to have been a victim of a political assassination a lot of people try to convince me to one me that to be careful I say why no no I know what I'm doing so for me is I have no H why I have to continue this mission like the people they hope to represent most of the candidates have little money and with the campaign budget coming out of their pockets funds are limited so saying commas encouraging party members to be creative like recording policy messages for Facebook so we have thousand of what are doing like that okay so it's like grassroots media yeah yes when there's no independent media have to find out we have to find a way it's not only the main political opposition party that's been destroyed in the lead-up to the election the independent media has been decimated to the alleged new weapon taxation last September after 24 years in operation one of the country's most fearless newspapers the Cambodia daily was forced to shut down when it received a tax bill of six point three million dollars its final headline called no punches the Cambodia dailies former manager Douglas Steele an owner publisher Deborah Krisha steel are currently living in Tokyo back in Cambodia they both face criminal charges for tax evasion carrying a prison sentence of up to six years they chose essentially a number that was unpayable and were very hardline about that yeah Steele vehemently denies evading tax but concedes the company may have owed the department some money the whole country is coming into the tax system most businesses are still not registered you're going from a zero percent compliance to a normal system and we were moving along in that process we got singled out because they didn't like us your excellency Maryann jolly from al-jazeera the man who's overseen the tax reforms is Vibol Kong the director-general of the taxation department a member of the ruling party's elite Central Committee today we meet him in his palatial office on the top floor of the department we have done a tremendous reform on the revenue because the government realized that for the country to move forward for the development of the country we need a revenue to expand the ball Kong refutes accusations his department has targeted independent media I think that statement is not true is fall but some people would say that it's an amazing coincidence that four of the only independent news organizations in this country received very large tax bills it's not true regardless all independent newspaper or not independent newspaper they are subject to the rule of law here that's my role here the United States government isn't convinced in January it withdrew funding from the tax department citing concerns about anti-democratic behavior Cambodia daily when they receive a tax bill they jump to talk to diplomatics to the embassy to international community by discrediting the government that the government target them but actually we are not talking anybody what about 10,000 other company in which we are auditing they never complain anything why only Cambodia daily but a search of the Cambodian company registry reveals furball Kong's family appears to own a very large business and may have some questions to answer one of the biggest petroleum companies in the country it was incorporated in 2008 but according to the records here it didn't register with the tax department until March 2017 the same time as the Cambodia daily it says on the company register that it only registered for taxation in 2017 I don't know what are you talking about I'm just trying to understand whether perhaps your own family company has been audited to determine tax owed prior to when it registered with the department in 2017 no it's not true it has been registered a long time ago so that date on the official Cambodia company registry is wrong wrong maybe they put in the system wrong when I mentioned the company registry also shows that two directors and a chairwoman all relatives live at his home address it seems those records are wrong to talk about to the wrong person I think I have nothing related to this company but they share a home address with you know I think long time ago but I got nothing to do with that but those details are on the cambodian company registry that's now online which has been newly put online yeah but I think it's wrong it's wrong wrong right so your family has no association with that company anymore we sold long time I think maybe the use of my I tried before but they never been and I don't know when they sold right yeah the fact isn't actually their place of residence it would raise real questions about what kind of arrangements have been made with regard to this company what is his interest in the company is he in some way profiting from the benefits of the company in a way that it's not transparent it might be completely legitimate but it he's raising red flags that are worthy of questioning and the investigation mark burns ak is one of Australia's leading anti-money laundering experts he finds it extraordinary that furball Kong's family wouldn't have updated the registry if the company had been sold normally there would be an obligation to update the registry to accurately reflect who the new owners are you wouldn't still allow yourself to be listed as the owner because you're carrying liabilities for the operations of that company the bowl Kong has financial questions to answer in Australia too in Cambodia his official salary is less than $1,000 a month and he has no other known sources of income but here in the southeastern city of Melbourne he has millions of dollars worth of property and has established numerous companies the company behind recent property purchases is pana red Pty Limited set up in 2011 the bowl Kong is the sole director under Australian corporate law sole directors of companies must live in the country this is the address for bol Kong has given us his - the Australian Securities and Investments Commission but having lived in Cambodia since 1993 and worked as a senior government official he clearly doesn't reside here it's of great concern here that we've got a senior foreign government official giving an address that does not appear be his place of residence that would be a breach of Australian corporations law if that is not his place of residence so it's a huge red flag I understand that you have several million dollars worth of property in Australia from Australian Records publicly available records I understand that you have a company called pan orig Pty Limited it appears you have broken corporate law in Australia by registering a business and giving an Australian address when you actually live in Cambodia and are the head of the tax department here I think that business sin I before I start working in Cambodia long time ago but it was actually registered not that long ago I've got the company extract no but I transfer to the the other person already maybe the record is not updated so you don't really know anything about that company pana reed Pty Limited is a long time ago yeah I got nothing to do with her in Australia mark Zurn Zack believes Australia's corporate database is accurate he is the sole beneficiary of this company is the sole beneficial owner of this company and for the company to keep going someone's got to be paying a regular annual registration fee to keep it registered here in Australia so it's stretches belief to think that he doesn't know this company exists the Balkans Australian business associates raise even more red flags from 2006 he set up two investment companies and several trusts with an Australian Cambodian couple who was soon after convicted of defrauding the Australian tax department of more than 1.8 million dollars and suspected of laundering and hiding nearly fifteen million dollars the ball Kong denies knowing about the conviction or being in business with them but you had businesses with him from around about 2006 and he was convicted and it made the newspapers in Australia at the beginning of 2007 I was not aware the any Commission I told the guy don't involve anything with me at all because don't use my name and I never get any interest I love that so I think your information is wrong so it's not involved in any businesses with him even though Australian records show you yeah I know so they're false yes as is the Cambodia company registry is false about your family's company exactly but 2013 Australian court documents reveal otherwise he did even more business with the couple big business transferring 1.2 million Australian dollars into an investment trust they'd set up I can't remember that transaction no the money money every day you train yes but I cannot I cannot remember that I transferred to that account you know because somebody can use my name to do that so even though your affidavit signed affidavit I believe witnessed by the Australian Embassy clearly states that you transferred 1.2 million dollars into the account account when was it 2013 how'd you get those information because it's freely available in Australia we have access to court records how have you managed to accumulate your wealth given that you have no businesses in Cambodia under your name I don't want to talk about it right so this is a very large sum of money for a senior government official which appears quite disproportionate to that officials official level of salary this sort of set off huge alarm bell cos our potential risk for money laundering type activities or proceeds of crime topic tivity what concerns me most is that how authorities seem to be turning a blind eye to all the activities which are happening Kalyan Key is part of Milburn's large Cambodian community she doesn't know the Bolcom but says other senior members of government and their families have made Melbourne a hotbed of illicit activity the money-laundering the drug trafficking for the human rights abuses that happen and glaringly obvious and an open secret in the community until recently she worked as an advisor to the consent government alongside the prime minister's son and heir-apparent one Minette but says she stopped when she became disillusioned with the flagrant corruption of officials the main figures and Kimberlin politics at the moment has connection to Australia the richest man in Cambodia is also Australian so there's a lot of interests in ensuring that the Cambodian Australian community remains with the current government because there's a lot there's a lot of connections that is important in a lot of informal connections what do you mean by informal activities informal being isn't it's a legal kind of black-market community Kalyan says a smuggling of luxury goods and cash as well as drugs is rife among the ruling party elite and that government and military officials regularly transfer large sums of money to family or associates in Australia with few questions asked maybe to buy a house or a car and the bank would just call up and say where'd you get that money from and then if you just answer it's family money yeah they don't follow it up and in Australia there are some very well-connected family members Prime Minister Hun Sen's nephew 'unto is married to an Australian Cambodian woman and is a regular visitor to Melbourne while in town he drives around in this Lamborghini with personalised number plates Australian authorities reportedly suspect him of being involved in trafficking drugs everyone knows that what he's doing is not right they know where the money's coming from they know what the human rights abuses but we don't we don't say much about it because I think people that scare concern hunt Oh doesn't have any property in his name but his wife has a multi-million dollar portfolio her most recent known property purchase is this land bought for more than eight hundred thousand dollars with no mortgage a luxury home is now being built this motorbike importing business is owned by another member of Hun Sen's family his son-in-law of the chiid II who is head of the Cambodian police security unit on Australian company documents he also falsely claims to live in Melbourne if you were engaged in criminal activity having a legitimate business that was doing importing he's a great way to allow you to use your proceeds of launder your proceeds of crime and that does make it a challenge for law enforcement Kalyan Key says she and others in her community have made complaints about the criminal activities of Cambodia's ruling elite in Australia I have raised concerns well the Australian Government I have raised concerns with the Australian investor and the response is the same like it's not our priority and this is not what we are here to do so we're here to make good friendship with the Cambodian government's so what that allowing them to do is have these informal elicits activities happen so they are somewhat endorsing corruption the Australian Government refutes Kali Ann Keyes claims it condones illicit activities back in Cambodia with the election imminent the
