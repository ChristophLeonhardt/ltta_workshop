like what is the food you've done the most and you told me probably omelettes I'm the most so what's your move let's look I go with a Jacques p√©pin Platonic ideal eggs salt pepper cook good butter not over beaten you want a little rippling in their texture and cooked bhavas meaning a little wet a little wet just you know in a pan figure 8 pattern don't over don't over scramble don't overbeat pull them off the pull them off the heat just before they're done finish as they sigh onto the plate and serve I don't know how I can answer that better so I'm not gonna try but one time I attract Wylie Dufresne they're having a they were having a wd-50 holiday party at mission Chinese food and we set up an induction burner in the corner and we had some eggs in a pot and a whisk because I knew while he was like while he's like if anyone knows Wylie Dufresne he's like the king of eggs he loves eggs he love scrambled eggs so I I was like hey chef can you help me like I don't really know what I'm doing over here and this in the middle of their holiday party we had a tin of caviar and like all these eggs and I said hey can you help me I just need to figure out how to do these eggs over here and he was like oh you mean Midtown eggs and I was like one of Midtown he's like so everybody wants to guys cooked in Midtown and he's like showed me he just butter eggs whisk whisk it really on and off the heat slowly to get these little tiny curds and he finished it at the very last second I want to say finish it with cream cheese and not creme fraiche it had that it gave his really silky luxurious texture and creme fraiche and yeah and then he put it on top of toasted white bread like white toast points and then we put caviar on it that was the best family I've ever had in my life obviously but even without the caviar it was like it was crazy because he had this technique but I mean I tried doing it with him and completely messed it up the first time so you know things are about the eggs it's like chefs nerd out because it's the most unforgiving and most satisfying thing to me in the world so I can't but his answer was the best I just I don't I don't really scramble eggs at home that often make a lot of Hamelin yeah bill yeah I still I still I I hated cooking professionally but at home you know cookie and omelette for somebody you care about yeah that's the best unlike most of my career that that that egg white omelets ever have you've done an egg white helmet for yourself every shouldn't be intimate with anyone who just eats egg white omelets I mean that's the end of a relationship right right there
