two three four five six seven eight police officer of various causes five by gunfire two by automobile crash one heart attack while carrying out his job duties yet the left continues to vilify police now we know some details about the person who killed a corporal Cole in Somerset County Maine this is going to infuriate you suspect Don Williams the wanted he hasn't been caught mmm he had been arrested in Massachusetts Essex County Massachusetts on a gun charge March 22nd of 2018 only a month a couple of days before he killed that be Cole Corporal ho the judge in the case was a history a history judge named Michael Patten Oh is a history of bowing easy on violent offenders released his bail from ten thousand seventy five hundred then to five thousand dollars fight objections from the assistant district attorney these judges are out of control this is a guy who had been arrested in 2006 for burglary who had been arrested in 2017 for theft and was arrested March 22nd 2018 in London free New Hampshire blue new Massachusetts blue Massachusetts there they rock down on guns what's the point what is the point of all of these draconian laws that infringe on the Second Amendment that infringe on our other rights if liberal judges are not going to enforce the law if liberal judges are going to keep setting these people free to prey on society that's the problem why are we not holding judges to the same standards that we hold police office and the general public is a concept called transferred intent if I Drive you to a liquor store you go inside to rob that liquor store I know you're gonna rob a liquor store even if I don't know that you intend to kill the clerk in the liquor store and you do I still in most states could charge with that murder I'm part of the criminal conspiracy my actions led to the death of that innocent person my driving you had I not driven you who that liquor store you wouldn't have been there to kill the employee why then are we not applying that same standard to judges if a judge looks at a suspect with a laundry list of violent felonies on their record and they're currently standing in front of that judge for a violent crime a gun offense a robbery or rape a and could murder a violent assault and that judge because they're so far left from being in government decides to give him $5,000 bail and a month later that person goes out and murders a police officer an innocent a dad drive into his son's baseball prac if that judge excuse me is responsible for that savage being on the street why are we not charging that judge with something related to that crime when that judge gave the bare minimum judges should be held accountable I don't want to hear about judicial discretion anymore I don't wanna hear about your digital immunity anymore the families of the dead cops and innocents don't want to hear it if a judge wants to give the minimum for violent crimes if they want to be these bleeding hearts then let them do it under some sort of penalty under some sort of criminal charge under some sort of financial sanction losing their judgeship being disbarred whatever it may be but we cannot allow judges to keep putting these savage predators back on the street to prey on the most innocent among us and those who put their lives on the line to protect us look cops have a dangerous enough job every single day with unknown threats it is inexcusable inexcusable that judges are putting known threats back on the street to prey on police officers in the public and it is long past time we started holding these judges accountable this is very important content and I want to keep exposing these far left judges that are putting us all in danger really happening around the world doesn't matter if in the US Hanan to the UK these far left judges are putting everyone in danger around the world help me do that by subscribing to our premium service wwww or slash shows
