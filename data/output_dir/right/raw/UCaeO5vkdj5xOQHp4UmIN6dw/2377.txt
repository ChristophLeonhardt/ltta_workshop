somebody painted it sloppily and it's

103
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,520
all smeared because the smoke is so

104
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,220
thick my car is covered in ashes and

105
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,310

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">they had their fingers in their ears</font>

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Trump was shooting himself in the</font>

158
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,810
foot and she didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about</font>

159
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,610
him i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know cuz she does not</font>

160
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,430
appealing to the left of the party who

161
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">are now good and properly ticked off</font>

162
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,300
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these wikileaks of thousands</font>

163
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,620
of DNC emails showing that in fact just

164
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,169
like Bernie said they were the DNC was

165
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:57,970
plotting against him they were saying

166
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,980
all these nasty things about him they

167
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,780
were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use his religion against</font>

168
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,990
him they were you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know strategizing on</font>

169
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,330
how to defeat him and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over and</font>

170
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,830
they're wishing oh why<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't it just</font>

171
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,930
over so everything that Bernie said well

172
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,280
here's Bernie's response to hearing the

173
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,850
news what he had to say he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to</font>

174
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,610
George Stephanopoulos I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you long</font>

175
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">time ago let the that the DNC was not</font>

176
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,160
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fair operation that they were</font>

177
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,789
supporting Secretary Clinton so what I

178
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,650
suggested to be true six months ago

179
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">turns out in fact</font>

180
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,520
to be true I'm not shocked this but I am

181
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,760
disappointed and thats is the way it is

182
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,540
what should be done about it well you

183
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,490
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I also said many months ago is</font>

184
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,320
that for a variety of reasons debbie

185
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,080
Wasserman Schultz<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be chair of</font>

186
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,070
the DNC and I think these emails

187
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,960
reiterate that reason why she should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

188
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chair but I think the main</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to</font>

189
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,350
my mind is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only these emails the</font>

190
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,450
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason is we need a democratic</font>

191
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,160
party that is open that is bringing

192
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,560
working people into the party that is

193
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,820
bringing young people that is bringing

194
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,890
all of the people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this country was</font>

195
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,230
sick and tired of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy that works</font>

196
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,850
well for the one percent while the

197
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,070
middle class continues citizen<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on</font>

198
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,720
repeat what our campaign was about

199
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,030
George was ouch campaign was about

200
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,580
revitalizing American democracy I want

201
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that incorporated into the</font>

202
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,910
Democratic body and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

203
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,200
debbie Wasserman Schultz is the person

204
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,330
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that see the reason</font>

205
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,490
this is important that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the press is way</font>

206
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,260
under plane and I'll get back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in</font>

207
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,460
a minute but the reason it's important

208
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,600
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because of us not because of</font>

209
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,490
conservatives it's important because

210
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hillary Clinton is now at the top of a</font>

211
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,260
party that disagrees with her that the

212
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,690
party something like sixty percent of

213
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,240
Democrats sixty percent have a positive

214
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,090
view of socialism sixty percent of the

215
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,350
party have a positive view of a

216
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,360
philosophy that has sapped every country

217
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,190
it has ever touched to SAP the energy

218
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,560

energy every country it has ever touched

sixty percent of Democrats now think not

a bad idea you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could destroy our</font>

someone to ask his belief does he

248
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,220
points difference with my peeps in

249
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,489

250
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,529
of that no and I didn't know anything

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I haven't read any of those</font>

252
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:36,730
but I am adamantly opposed to anyone

253
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,119
bringing religion into our political

254
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,720
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the Constitution says</font>

255
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,999
no religious test so that is just

256
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely wrong and unacceptable but</font>

257
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:50,739
maybe the point Madam Secretary is you

258
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,569
have people in the Democratic National

going to be and they seem to have their

262
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,639
thumb on the scale for you they seem to

any effort in the DNC to favor one

271
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,699
candidate or another would have been

313
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,339
says why do you do it why do you stand

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,339
for and Clinton's best line I mean here

316
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,279
line about whether she's corrupt or not

317
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to this I will take</font>

318
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,530
responsibility for any impression or

319
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,930
anything I've ever done that people have

320
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,270
legitimate questions about but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

321
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fair to say there's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

322
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,089
concerted effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince people like</font>

that young man of something nobody's

324
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,570
quite sure what but of something I often

325
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,820
feel like there's the Hillary standard

326
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,900
and then there's the standard for

327
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,700
everybody else look at Hilary sir well

328
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,300
it is you know a lot of as you saw the

329
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,290
Republican convention unfounded

330
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,570
inaccurate mean-spirited attacks with no

331
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,459
basis in truth reality which take on a

332
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,170
life of their own and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

333
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,150
reasons and I don't want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

334
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,459
analyze the reasons i see it i

335
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:03,000
understand it people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very willing to</font>

336
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,300
say things<font color="#CCCCCC"> about me to make a ques at</font>

337
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,020
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't get upset about them anymore</font>

338
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,589
but they are very regrettable this is

339
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,500
the Hillary standard and the standard

340
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line for her</font>

341
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,030
you know because the Hillary standard if

342
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,230
she weren't running on the Hillary

343
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,820
standard they'd be taking her picture

344
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,920
face forward and then sideways and

345
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,620
leading away in handcuffs I mean

346
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,650
everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the planet would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in</font>

347
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,750

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't put it on the air because the</font>

356
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,270
press well we know they're in the tank

357
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,980
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look I'm going to</font>

358
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,990
tell you I've told you the clave ins

359
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,340
first rule of mainstream media

360
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,720
journalism now I'm going to tell you the

361
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,280
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule of mainstream media</font>

362
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,380
journalism and you may have to we're

363
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose you on facebook in a</font>

364
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,490
minute so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have to tune in at the</font>

365
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,540
daily wire if you want to hear this but

366
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,120
first let's look at Clinton's campaign

367
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,370
manager what he's going to say about the

368
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,980
D&C it's all a big Russian conspiracies

369
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,770
Robbie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mook talking about how the emails</font>

370
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,320
were released what is the reaction of

371
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Clinton campaign to these DNC leaked</font>

372
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,870
emails suggesting that top officials

373
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,030
including the CFO there we're actively

374
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,520
discussing ways to hurt bernie sanders

375
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,260
in the primaries well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the DNC</font>

376
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,790
needs to look into this and take

377
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,650
appropriate action and I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

378
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,990
they will what's disturbing to us is

379
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we experts are telling us that</font>

380
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,850
Russian state actors broke into the DNC

381
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,630
stole these emails and other experts are

382
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,460
now saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are the Russians</font>

383
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,200
are releasing these emails for the

384
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,089
purpose of actually helping Donald Trump

385
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,560
I don't think it's coincidental that

386
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,930
these emails were released<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the eve of</font>

387
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,089
our convention here and and that's

388
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,890
disturbing and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

389
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,089
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

390
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:03,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">be concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we also saw a last</font>

391
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,380
week at the Republican convention that

392
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,600
Trump and his allies made changes to the

393
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,390
Republican platform to make it more

394
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,610
pro-russian and and we saw him talking

395
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how NATO shouldn't intervene to</font>

396
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,390
defend necessarily should intervene to

397
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,339
defend our Eastern European allies if

398
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,140
they're attacked by Russia so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

399
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,670
when you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this together it's a</font>

400
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,080
disturbing picture and I think voters

401
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,450
need to reflect on that all right on

402
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,490
that crazy note we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will leave you at</font>

403
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,560
Facebook come to the daily wire and here

404
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,970
the rest will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

405
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,610
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rule number one of</font>

410
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,310
whenever the prejudices and illusions of

411
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,960
left wingers are confirmed by an

412
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,820
individual incident the incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

413
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,650
treated as representative when those

prejudices and illusions are

415
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,980
contradicted the incident is considered

416
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,690
an aberration and treating it as

417
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,610
representative is deemed hateful that's

418
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,470
the first rule clave ins first rule of

number two when a scandal breaks on the

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,950
the scandal when a scandal breaks on the

423
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">left what's important is where the</font>

424
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,210
information came from and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

425
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,300
obtained so that's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see a guy</font>

426
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,860
goes in with a hidden camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

husband Joseph Wilson lied about<font color="#CCCCCC"> George</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font>

468
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,330
Russians it's disgusting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so phony I</font>

469
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,800
watched him bumble through the interview

470
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,360
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to hear it on audio a little</font>

471
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,790
bit I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't think of bigger lives</font>

472
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,800
but that exactly goes to show you what

473
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,570
the DNC and what in the Clinton camp

474
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,850
will do they will lie and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything to</font>

475
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,830
win you hear it with the DNC where

476
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,270
they're leaking emails about Bernie

477
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,250
Sanders and his Jewish heritage to be

478
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,990
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to destroy him in the south</font>

479
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,720
it's a rigged<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's disgusting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

480
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,250
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be fed up because when</font>

481
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,920
I heard it I certainly was so I have to

482
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,190
say I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the guy's father had</font>

483
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,050
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of focus like he goes right</font>

484
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,880
for what he has to say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says it</font>

485
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,920
and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is got a little bit of his</font>

486
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,530
father's fire and toughness and that

487
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,050
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know cut your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throat respond</font>

488
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,150
so he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold back but he seems to</font>

489
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,559
actually be focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what he's</font>

490
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,940
supposed to be doing as opposed to

491
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,710
Donald from that I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happened</font>

492
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,500
after the clava new last Clavin week

493
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,030
ended so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

494
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,640
little bit about Trump's speech at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

495
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,559
RNC convention the Republican convention

496
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,429
I had I'm Shapiro and I had almost

497
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:48,280
virtually the same reaction we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

498
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,260
text messaging back and forth I read the

499
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,679
speech about an hour before<font color="#E5E5E5"> he made the</font>

500
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,360
speech I thought Jesus<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a pretty</font>

501
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,070
good speech and it was full<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the usual</font>

502
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,200
Trump stuff Trump is really good at

503
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,910
identifying the problems and describing

504
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,160
the problems he hasn't no policies to

505
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,260
suggest except I alone can fix it but

506
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,740
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a piece of this speech when</font>

507
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,679
he started to give it I thought my

508
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,540
opinion totally changed here's the first

509
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,580
part i will present the facts<font color="#E5E5E5"> plainly</font>

510
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,900
and honestly

511
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,740
we cannot afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be so politically</font>

512
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,940
correct anymore so if you want to hear

513
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> corporate spin the carefully crafted</font>

514
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,910
lies and the media myths the Democrats

515
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,880
are holding their convention next week

516
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,740
go there but here at our convention

517
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,000
there will be no lies we will honor the

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,640
American people with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> truth and</font>

519
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,790
nothing else see that's good stuff on

520
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,320
the page because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the whole</font>

521
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,150
problem we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all feel we're being lied to</font>

522
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,770
we feel that the press is selling us a

523
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,270
bill of goods<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're selling this of</font>

524
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,130
the Obama presidency is<font color="#E5E5E5"> scandal free</font>

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,440
success when it's an utter failure

they're selling us Hillary Clinton is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

546
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,120
single news story every single news

547
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,490
story used the same word as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost as</font>

548
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,780
if they were coordinating with the

549
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">democrats on their stories it was dark</font>

550
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,250
it was dark he talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the</font>

551
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,380
terrorism and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the division</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

552
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,850
country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the account it</font>

553
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,090
was dark a guy's dark as if the people

554
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,890

555
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,810
great you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gosh that's why that's</font>

556
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,670
why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just are nominating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

557
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,010
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our parties instead of Donald</font>

558
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,750
Trump you know they nominated own Trump

559
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,290
because they hate you they hate you

560
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I they hate the establishment they ate</font>

561
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,740
the Republican Party they<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate the</font>

562
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,090
Democrat Party they hate the breast

563
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,340
that's why Trump is there and the press

564
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,230
going it's dark it's like it's dark

565
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,000
because we hate you that's why he's

566
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,770
standing there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's not that that's</font>

567
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,840
not even a criticism of the guy and then

568
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,430
you know he did a good job he took

569
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,410
Clinton apart he just did it at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

570
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,710
of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> lungs play the second country and</font>

571
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,490
when a secretary of state illegally

572
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,690
stores<font color="#E5E5E5"> or emails on a private server</font>

573
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,230
deletes 33,000 of them so the

574
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,340
authorities can't see her crime puts our

575
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,500
country at risk lies about it in every

576
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,580
different form and faces no consequence

577
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,690
I know that corruption has reached a

578
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,930
level like never ever before in our

579
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,580
country when the FBI director says that

580
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,000
the Secretary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> State was extremely</font>

581
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,710
careless and negligent in handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

582
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,830
classified secrets<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also know that</font>

583
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,580
these terms are minor compared to what

584
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,180
she actually did they were just used to

585
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,750
save her from facing justice for her

586
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,310
terrible terrible crimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he's he's</font>

587
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,930
screaming you at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said I am</font>

588
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,280
your voice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought no one room so</font>

589
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">horse you know it's great but here's the</font>

590
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,530
thing here's the thing it's it was a

591
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,560
good speech<font color="#CCCCCC"> too too loud too slow but</font>

592
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,210
still the content was pretty good

593
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,560
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten a bump in the</font>

594
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,210
polls and all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he can't</font>

595
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,730
stay focused I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes you know</font>

596
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,220
this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next day this is remember the</font>

597
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,480
peak of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> campaign you've just had</font>

598
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,370
your convention the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

599
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,020
basically happened was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> convention</font>

600
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,220
and the debates those are the things

601
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,110
that people really pay attention to they

602
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,340
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay attention to every little</font>

603
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,900
detail they pay attention to these big

604
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,450
moments so he's got this bounce he goes

605
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,370
out he starts attacking Ted Cruz he's

606
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,710
standing with his VP Mike Pence and he

607
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,080
says to the crowd can the press if the

608
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,810
president start a super PAC to destroy

609
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,420
Ted Cruz I mean if I'm president can I

610
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,800
and he turns around and Mike Pence's

611
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,290
shaking

612
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,650
no no don't do that and he doubles down

613
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,390
on it he goes on with Chuck Todd and

614
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,950
Todd asks him about it and he says yeah

615
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,150
that's what I'm gonna do while I'm

616
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,820
president are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to fund a</font>

617
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,100
super PAC to help defeat well it's not

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an every one thing on my mind look</font>

the republican party with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> be yeah</font>

622
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do a super</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pac and you</font>

623
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,150
know when they run against Kasich okay

624
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,860
for 10 to 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollars all right</font>

625
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,850
against Ted Cruz and maybe one of the

626
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,380
person that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about what's</font>

627
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,060
that other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our say that I mean</font>

628
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,510
she sees he's actually such a small

629
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,100
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate to give him the publicity</font>

630
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,950
but yes I will probably do that at the

631
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,210
appropriate time but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do</font>

632
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh give me the small person</font>

633
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,600
no no don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry better we give it to</font>

634
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">you another time how was he talking</font>

635
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,430
about that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> for president the</font>

636
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">United States he's gonna sit her</font>

637
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,660
targeting guys in his own party I mean

638
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,460
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is the thing this is the</font>

639
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,050
thing it so everybody jumped on me last

640
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,450
week because i believe and i still

641
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,430
believe that Ted Cruz made an immoral

642
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,280
error in showing up at the convention

643
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,310
and basically giving the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Donald</font>

644
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,530
Trump at the convention I was I did not

645
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he should get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of his</font>

646
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,680
principles I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

647
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,420
shouldn't say what he had to say I said

648
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">he shouldn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone there to say it</font>

649
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,800
that was the party's party that was the

650
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,290
party's celebration of their guy he

651
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,970
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have stayed away he doesn't have</font>

652
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to I just felt he was elevating himself</font>

653
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,320
and his sense of his own principles

654
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,140
above his job which is it's fine if he

655
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,430
wants to attack trump I have no problem

656
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his attacking Trump whatsoever but</font>

657
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,440
but politics politics grows out of

658
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,690
morality but it's not morality the

659
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,040
difference between morality is very

660
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,710
simple if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are a Christian you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

661
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,110
to do what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as a Christian even if</font>

662
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,210
they throw you to the Lions even if they

663
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,530
throw you to the lines that's a victory

664
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,360
for a Christian to get do you know

665
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,860
that's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the victory of Christ</font>

666
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,110
right he goes to the cross that's what

667
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,780
morality is like politics you gotta win

668
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,880
politics is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> instrument for winning</font>

669
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,620
you've got to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> your principles but</font>

670
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,660
you've gotta win with your principles if

671
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,240
you get thrown to the Lions every

672
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
election as a conservative you

673
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,130
the self-satisfied schmuck you know

674
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,080
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy who thinks he's right</font>

675
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,270
that's why in politics you compromise

676
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,490
we're in moral issues you don't that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

677
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,830
why sometimes we attack these guys

678
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,559
unfairly because they have to make

679
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,090
compromises to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay alive I mean that's</font>

680
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of politics is winning and I think</font>

681
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is as Reagan said there is no</font>

682
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,809
substitute for victory and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Ted</font>

683
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,549
Cruz let his ego get in the way he

684
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:19,260
thought he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go and slip it</font>

685
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,860
slip a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italian knife into Donald</font>

686
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,150
Trump snack and Trump wasn't going to

687
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,070
even notice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically he brought a</font>

688
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,770
stiletto to a nuclear war because Trump

689
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,900
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> blew him to pieces and the polls</font>

690
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,730
are now reflecting that so that that's

691
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,410
my only point about him that he was not

692
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,169
serving the purposes of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> party and if</font>

693
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:38,700
he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack his party he</font>

694
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,809
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have gone to the party's</font>

695
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:41,100
convention to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was my only</font>

696
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,540
point about him not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he shouldn't</font>

697
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,250
say whatever he wants to say the my

698
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,590
problem right now is that conservatism

699
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,260
has collapsed when I saw Ivanka Trump

700
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,549
get up and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speech and she's</font>

701
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">very beautiful and the dress she was</font>

702
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,510
wearing sold out in minutes after after

703
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,770
she stepped down I did it was out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

704
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,780
stores<font color="#E5E5E5"> and minutes people like during</font>

705
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,950
all the stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when she was talking</font>

706
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know equal pay for women like</font>

707
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,169
the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> should mandate equal pay</font>

708
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,669
for women and would under a trump

709
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,169
administration and people were cheering

710
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,000
that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's not</font>

711
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,299
conservatism that's my my philosophy my

712
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,919
point of view has disappeared from the

713
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,100
scene fox news the chief you know

714
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">information of giver the chief media</font>

715
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,350
information giver of conservatism is

716
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,350
collapsing in a sex scandal we're in

717
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,240
disarray we're in disarray and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

718
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,400
rebuild the conservatism not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that</font>

719
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,990
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can win and</font>

720
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm very much opposed by the way to</font>

721
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,900
these guys who say in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order for</font>

722
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,549
conservatism to win it has to become

723
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">liberalism that means nothing to me</font>

724
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,620
winning as a liberal means nothing to me

725
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,900
but we do have to think about how we win

726
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,700
and where we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and listen there's an</font>

727
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,470
argument to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made the conservatism is</font>

728
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,929
in better shape if Trump loses that then

729
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,490
we still have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Republican Party and</font>

730
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,470
we can rebuild within the party if Trump

731
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,929
wins we may need a new party to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

732
00:27:57,929 --> 00:27:59,340
out we may<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to distance</font>

733
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,870
ourselves from Trump and we may have to

734
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,100
see you know maybe Trump will become

735
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,570
conservative you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe he's made a</font>

736
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,190
promise to appoint a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Supreme Court judge</font>

737
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the tradition of Scalia let's</font>

738
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,590
say let's see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this brings me to</font>

739
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff i like because if of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

740
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the culture is the long</font>

741
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,920
game and if we fight in the culture and

742
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,290
win in the culture will win 20 years

743
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,050
down the line so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a controversial</font>

744
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,940
stuff i<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that now recommended this</font>

745
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,530
to about three or four people and gotten

746
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,500
different reactions from everybody the

747
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,910
Coen brothers recently made a movie

748
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,230
called Hail Caesar which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

749
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,610
did very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this guy hasn't got</font>

750
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,220
very good ratings on rotten tomatoes and

751
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,080
all this stuff I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was terrific</font>

752
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,910
and my attitude toward Coen brothers is

753
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,880
simple I love their crime films I loved

754
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,320
Fargo I loved blood so I loved blood

755
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,910
simple and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one no country for</font>

756
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,220
old men I love their crime stories I

757
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,380
hate their other films I think they're

758
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,179
boring I think they're rambling I think

759
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:55,100
they're up to sand obscure you know

760
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,570
they're they're obscure they like they

761
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,650
you don't know what they're saying and

762
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,970
that's supposed to be profound and I

763
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,440
just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's profound so I</font>

764
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,520
didn't think I was going to like this

765
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,650
movie but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most</font>

766
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,750
anti-communist pro-christian film that

767
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,090
is well made that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have seen in a long</font>

768
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">time plus it's hilarious it's about</font>

769
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,020
old-time Hollywood Hollywood in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 50s</font>

770
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,179
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Communists infiltrating holly</font>

771
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,890
was the only time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i have ever</font>

772
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,380
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a film about the communists in</font>

773
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,700
