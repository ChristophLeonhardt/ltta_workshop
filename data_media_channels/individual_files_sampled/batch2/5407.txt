let me start with the Rick Tyler Rick how first of all a couple quick questions for you as a Republican communication guru how are the Republicans doing right now and this Cavanaugh fight not particularly well Joe but I think I think the tide is look here's the problem this whole process is not designed to get at the truth and now you have this this lawyer Katz who's who's representing Blasi and they're putting all these conditions on on a hearing and and I think this is maybe backfiring on the on the Republicans or not the Republicans a little bit but on the Democrats a good bit but on the Democrats and Doni your PR guy the last thing if you're running PR for the Republicans that you want is to have dr. Ford testifying on the committee so you did more preconditions they set down the more you going thank you thank you now if you can make it on a rocket ship to Mars thank you make this as impossible as you can for us it seems to me at some point the Democrats are gonna have to step in and say listen we need your client up there yeah yeah what the Republicans don't understand she will get up there but I don't know if any of these Republicans ever have any wives or daughters or sisters or friends that in any way have gone through an assault but when you listen to a woman talk right about how she's gone through and they remember what the breath smells like and everything about it and their eyes well of materials do they not understand what's gonna happen when this woman gets up there if they anyway so of course they do what was why they don't want her to get what she what she will get up there yeah but they don't want her to get up there so now they're trying to get a maybe get a legal counsel to ask questions and I'm sure they're thinking hopefully you can find a woman who could be a legal counsel to get up there to ask your questions but now Ford saying they're not going to do that every day this goes on and another condition is brought up is another horrible day for the Republicans we saw a lot of frustration I thought it was particularly interesting when Susan Collins spoke up and kind of said you're moving the goalposts on us a little bit and push back saying you know what you've got it we can't keep jumping through hoops for you and that was obviously and I think she had that conversation with Democrats and the Democrats are in a little bit of a tough bind here about how they come but it is horrible for Republicans the fact that they have to go at to an outside council because they need to have a woman they don't need outside counsel they need a woman to ask her questions right this is going to be disaster for the Republicans and yet they still probably need to try and force this through if they don't get this done by next Thursday mm-hmm it's off the table and that's gonna even become more of a camp I actually think if they find a woman litigator the cross-examiner that's actually far preferable to having foreign heads going hey lady I think you're just laying back stop don't keep their mouth shut anyway Joe we've heard reports about them they still make comments you know in conference calls or here they're they don't know how to handle themselves why don't we talk about that yeah in the news well new polling is showing support for Bret Cavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation has fallen since he's been accused of committing a sexual assault or an attempted sexual assault while in high school according to new NBC news/wall Street Journal poll 38% of voters now say they oppose his confirmation that is up nine points since last month when 29% were opposed and back in July twenty six percent were against Cavanaugh's confirmation this is the first time in the NBC news/wall Street Journal poll dating back to John Roberts nomination in 2005 that a Supreme Court nominee has been under water on this confirmation question increased opposition to Cavanaugh has come in particular from women over 50 who were plus 3 on Cavanaugh's confirmation in August and are mine 7.now a drop of 10 points suburban women who support went down 5 points since last month independence who were plus 15 last month r- 16 now boy that's a 31-point drop renewing and seniors were plus 9 in august and our negative 10 gene robinson that pole and a quarter won't even buy you a cup of coffee at a Starbucks on Capitol Hill but it does point to the bigger prey as far as the outcome Kavanagh none of the senators are gonna be looking at those poll numbers but people who are running Republicans who are running in the suburban districts in Hillary Clinton won and that Republicans hold are looking at those numbers because man that is just one more nail in their political coffin that the very groups that they were already losing they're bleeding even more support from yeah they are and you know those numbers 38 to 34 that means there are a lot of undecided out there there are a lot of people who aren't paying as close attention as we are when this hearing happens and I think it will happen you know those numbers will go up more people will have an opinion on Cavanaugh and I see the opposed number having a much better chance of rising farther and faster than the support number because of what Donnie said because of what the spectacle is almost sure to be like and so then I think you'll see more Republicans paying attention to those numbers and and they will be quite worrisome you know they they feel at this point that they have to bowl ahead that they'll be worse off if they fail to get Cavanaugh through but that equation could change after hearing all right so Jeremy Peters you're looking at how the evangelical community leaders in particular are looking at the Cavanaugh confirmation they're frustrated tell us why well because they see the chance to cement a conservative majority the Supreme Court for a generation at risk of slipping away I mean if you think about all that's being done they think well that's a very good question because it's hard to argue that the Republicans aren't really doing everything they can at this point they're trying to beat this along right I mean so that's why I think the next few days are so crucial so if you're Chuck Grassley do you move the hearing a few days forward that doesn't seem like an unreasonable ask Riley and Republicans have been having two conversations one publicly trying to appear as reasonable and deferential as possible in public to ford saying yes we will accommodate you we will come to you we will send investigators we will allow we won't put you in front of a public a commission and make you do this on television on the other hand because Republicans are under so much pressure from their base to get this done from especially evangelical Christian Catholic leaders a lot of whom were involved in the selection process of Cavanaugh in the first place they realize they if they do not get this done if Cavanaugh's nomination falls apart that very well could be the end of the Republican control of the Senate because the voters would just be so angry so depressed so deflated they're probably not going to well thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest
