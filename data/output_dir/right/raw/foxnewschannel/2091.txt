1
00:00:01,557 --> 00:00:04,460
AN IMPORTANT VOICE BUT I THINK

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,230
YOU ARE WRONG ON SOME DETAILS.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,730
>> HAVE ME BACK.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,264
THANK YOU.

5
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:09,332
>> Tucker: WITH SMART PHONES

6
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:10,366
EVERYWHERE IN EVERY POCKET IS

7
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:13,269
IT POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE SELFIES

8
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:15,438
IN EVERYBODY GETS ROPED IN, IT

9
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:16,338
TURNS OUT.

10
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:17,907
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE REST

11
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:18,675
OF US.

12
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:19,943
THE PRESIDENT DOES IT.

13
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:21,511
POPE FRANCIS DOES IT.

14
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:23,479
WELL, NOW, SOME RESEARCHERS

15
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:27,817
ARE CALLING THIS A DISEASE.

16
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,719
FEW PEOPLE REPORT BEING

17
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,120
HELPLESSLY ADDICTED TO TAKING

18
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,387
PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES SO THEY

19
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:34,123
SNAP HUNDREDS OF SELFIES EVERY

20
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:34,424
DAY.

21
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:36,192
THEY ARE SIMPLY UNABLE TO

22
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:36,526
STOP.

23
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:39,328
IS THERE MORE DISGUSTING

24
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:41,330
ILLNESSES IN THE WORLD?

25
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,031
PROBABLY NOT.

26
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,835
WE'RE JOINED BY A

27
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:46,836
PSYCHOTHERAPIST.

28
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:49,438
NEL, IT DEGRADES SCIENCE TO

29
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:51,340
CALL IT AN ILLNESS WHEN IT'S

30
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,375
SELF-INVOLVEMENT OF A KIND

31
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,276
WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH.

32
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,011
WE HAVE REACHED A GREATER

33
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:55,444
MAGNITUDE.

34
00:00:55,444 --> 00:00:56,879
>> I KNOW THAT IS IF GUT

35
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,181
REACTION AND I SEE WHY YOU

36
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,148
WOULD SAY THAT.

37
00:00:59,148 --> 00:01:00,983
BUT I THINK THERE IS A BIG

38
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:01,684
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THINKING

39
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:04,153
THAT SOMEONE IS NARCISSISTIC

40
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:05,788
AND THEY POST SELFIES ALL THE

41
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:07,790
TIME BECAUSE THEY SUFFER FROM

42
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,725
AN ELEMENT OF NARCISSISM AND

43
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:10,459
ACTUAL ADDICTION.

44
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,028
SO WHEN YOU HAVE WHAT IS CITED

45
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:15,731
IN THIS STUDY WAS A BUNCH OF

46
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:17,933
YOUNG WOMEN CONSTANTLY TAKING

47
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:18,968
SELFIES OF EACH OTHER YOU HAVE

48
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:20,303
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEVICES

49
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:20,903
ARE ADDICTIVE.

50
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:23,139
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK AND

51
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:24,307
IT HASN'T BEEN PROVEN THAT IT

52
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:26,075
COMES FROM A PLACE NECESSARILY

53
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,811
FROM A NARCISSISTIC PLACE.

54
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:30,112
>> Tucker: REALLY?

55
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,546
>> YEAH.

56
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:31,881
>> Tucker: SO IF YOU FIND

57
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,049
OUR OWN FACE THE MOST

58
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,116
INTERESTING IMAGE IN THE

59
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:36,118
WORLD, THAT IS NOT

60
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:36,619
SELF-INVOLVEMENT?

61
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,087
IT SEEMS LIKE IT TO ME.

62
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:39,288
>> I KNOW BUT ACTUALLY THINK

63
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,324
ABOUT IT, TUCKER.

64
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:42,692
WOULDN'T YOU THINK IF THAT IS

65
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:43,993
HOW YOU ARE SPENDING YOUR TIME

66
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:45,494
AND IT IMPAIRS YOUR DAILY

67
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:47,129
FUNCTION IT'S COMING FROM A

68
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:49,231
PLACE OF MAYBE PERHAPS LOW

69
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:49,632
SELF-ESTEEM?

70
00:01:49,632 --> 00:01:52,034
SO WE ARE FLOODED ALL THE

71
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,636
TIME -- THESE DEVICE,

72
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:54,537
UNDERSTAND INSTAGRAM AND

73
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:55,938
FACEBOOK, ALL THE SOCIAL MEDIA

74
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,039
PLATFORMS ARE BUILT TO BE

75
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,240
REALLY ADDICTIVE.

76
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,542
AND YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANY

77
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,510
MARKETING OR P.R. AGENCY THAT

78
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,478
DOESN'T SAY IF YOU ARE TRYING

79
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:04,580
TO BUILD A BRAND OR A BUSINESS

80
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,917
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T POST

81
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,151
PICTURES OF YOURSELF.

82
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,652
THAT IS THE MESSAGE WE ARE

83
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:11,387
SENDING CONSTANTLY.

84
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:13,122
THE GREATEST POPULATION ON

85
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:14,290
INSTAGRAM, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE

86
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,291
YOUNG WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES

87
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,459
OF 18 AND 25.

88
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,928
WHAT THEY LOOK AT THE MOST IS

89
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,863
MAKEUP AND FASHION.

90
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,431
WE ARE ATTRACTED TO PEOPLE'S

91
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:22,865
FACES.

92
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:24,366
THAT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE, THAT

93
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:27,002
IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT

94
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:28,237
TALKING ABOUT YOUNG WOMEN OR

95
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:30,039
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPER ADDICTED

96
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,041
TO TAKING SELFIES.

97
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,108
UNFORTUNATELY, SELFIES MAKE

98
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:33,442
MONEY.

99
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:34,843
IF YOU LOOK AT INSTAGRAM AT

100
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,912
ALL YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE IS

101
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:38,814
TONS OF PEOPLE MAKING MONEY BY

102
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:41,083
POSTING VIDEOS OF THEMSELVES,

103
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,285
FOR EXAMPLE, PUTTING ON MAKEUP

104
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:45,955
OR DOING, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT

105
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:46,922
EXERCISES AND SHOWING PEOPLE

106
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:48,357
HOW TO DO THAT.

107
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:51,226
>> Tucker: ASK YOU A QUICK

108
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:51,627
QUESTION.

109
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:52,661
THE FEMINIST LONG THAT IS DUMB

110
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,596
AND WRONG AS USUAL.

111
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:57,166
BUT DUMBER IS THE MOST MEN ARE

112
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,468
THE CAUSE OF THAT.

113
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:02,705
THEY ARE ADDING TO THE SUM

114
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:04,406
TOTAL OF UNHAPPINESS FOR YOUNG

115
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:05,674
WOMEN AND NO ONE CALLS THEM

116
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:06,175
OUT ON THAT.

117
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:07,209
WHY IS THAT?

118
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,077
>> Sean: THE FIRST PART OF

119
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:09,445
THE COMMENT I'M NOT SURE I

120
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,047
AGREE WITH I DON'T THINK ALL

121
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:13,048
FEMINISTS BELIEVE IT'S JUST

122
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:14,950
MEN CAUSING WOMEN TO HAVE LOW

123
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,417
SELF-ESTEEM.

124
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,051
>> Tucker: THE ONES THAT

125
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:17,986
COME ON TV SAY THAT.

126
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:19,455
>> OKAY.

127
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:20,622
I'M A FEMINIST AND I DON'T SAY

128
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:20,923
THAT.

129
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:22,725
HERE IS THE THING.

130
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:24,526
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

131
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:25,794
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE DEVICES

132
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:27,463
AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT

133
00:03:27,463 --> 00:03:29,565
FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM NEED TO

134
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,834
HAVE SORT OF A BIGGER ETHICAL

135
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,135
RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE

136
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:34,837
PLATFORMS THAT DON'T

137
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:35,771
NECESSARILY PUSH PEOPLE ALWAYS

138
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,773
HAVING TO POST THEIR FACE ON

139
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:39,408
THE PLATFORM TO BE SUPER

140
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:39,775
ADDICTIVE.

141
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,442
I AGREE.

142
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:40,976
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

00:03:40,976 --> 00:00:00,000
