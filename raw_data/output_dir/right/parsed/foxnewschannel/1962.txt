PETE: THAT'S RIGHT.
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS VOTED 5
TO 0 LAST NIGHT TO SUPPORT
THE DOJ'S LAWSUIT AGAINST
THAT SANCTUARY STATE.
STEVE: JOINING US RIGHT NOW
WEST COAST CORRESPONDENT FOX
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR TOMI
LAHREN.
TOMI, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS AND
THEIR MESSAGE TO SACRAMENTO?
>> I TELL YOU EVERY WEEK I'M
ON THIS SHOW AND EVERY WEEK
I TELL YOU CALIFORNIANS ARE
WAKING UP AND CITY BY CITY,
AREA BY AREA, COUNTY BY
COUNTY WE ARE SEEING IT MAKE
NO MISTAKE, CALIFORNIA WILL
NOT TOLERATE LAWLESSNESS
ANYMORE.
AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT
TAKING THIS AS A LEFT VS.
RIGHT ISSUE BUT AN ISSUE OF
SAFETY.
BUT I WILL SAY.
THIS THIS IS A CAUTIONARY
TALE TO THE DEMOCRATS.
YOU, DEMOCRATS, MADE THIS A
LEFT VS. RIGHT ISSUE BY
CHOOSING TO UPHOLD THE
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OVER
AMERICAN CITIZENS.
YOU CAUSED THIS.
AND NOW WHAT YOU ARE SEE
SOMETHING CALIFORNIA SAYING,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS
STANDING UP FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS OVER THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
I'M NOT SO SURE I SUPPORT
THAT PARTY ANYMORE.
IF IT CAN HAPPEN IN
CALIFORNIA, OF ALL PLACES IT
CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE AND IT
WILL.
AINSLEY: TOMI, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THIS STORY?
IT STARTED FIRST AT NYU.
NEW YORK UNIVERSITY VERY
LIBERAL SCHOOL AND NOW AT
RUTGERS, THEY HAVE THIS
CLASS WHERE THEY ARE
TRAINING THE STUDENTS WAYS
TO ASSESS UNDOCUMENTED
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
IT'S CALLED THE DREAM ZONE.
THEY'RE TEACHING THEM
PENDING LEGISLATION FOR DACA
STUDENTS.
THEY ARE TEACHING THEM THE
HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION IN
THE UNITED STATES AND
METHODS TO CHECK WHAT PEOPLE
ARE SAYING ABOUT
UNDOCUMENTED ILLEGALS ON
VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA SITES.
>> WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF
OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER
EDUCATION TAUGHT STUDENTS
ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND
IMMIGRATION LAW INSTEAD OF
HOW TO BREAK THAT LAW AND
HOW TO REINFORCE
LAWLESSNESS, LINE CUTTING
AND SALUTE
ABD SALUTE
ABSOSALUTE
ABSOLULUTE
ABSOLUTETE
ABSOLUTE LUNANCY?
LOOK AT THIS.
WE KNOW THAT COLLEGE
CAMPUSES ARE THE LAST
BASTION THE LEFT HAS THIS IS
THEIR STRONG HOLD.
THEY ARE MOVING FURTHER AND
FURTHER TO THE LEFT.
HOWEVER, BY DOING THIS, AS I
SAID WITH CALIFORNIA, THEY
ARE ONLY PUSHING PEOPLE TO
CENTER RIGHT.
SO WHEN THEY CONTINUE TO DO
THIS, THEY CONTINUE TO
CODDLE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
AND CONTINUE TO LAWLESSNESS
ALL THEY ARE DOING IS
HELPING OUR CAUSE.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO WAKE UP TO THIS
BECAUSE THIS IS UTTERLY
RIDICULOUS.
PETE: SPEAKING OF THAT CAUSE
KEITH ELLISON THE DEPUTY
CHAIRMAN OF THE DNC.
THE NUMBER TWO GUY, HE WAS
CAUGHT WEARING THIS T-SHIRT
AT AN EVENT.
THAT'S SPANISH.
I CAN'T PRONOUNCE THAT.
>> TRANSLATES TO I DO NOT
BELIEVE IN BORDERS CAUSE
PUSHED BY OPEN BORDER
GROUPS.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS WE
WANT A WALL.
WE BELIEVE IN SOVEREIGNTY IN
OUR NATION.
WITHOUT BORDERS YOU DON'T
HAVE A COUNTRY, IS HE NOT
FAIRLY ARTICULATING THE FACT
THAT THE MODERN LEFT LED BY
OUR LEADERSHIP DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN BORDERS.
>> OF COURSE, WELCOME AS YOU
SAID TO THE MODERN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
AND IT'S A PARTY THAT WILL
CONTINUE TO LOSE.
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE KEITH
ELLISON WHO PREACH OPEN
BORDERS.
BUT I DO HAVE TO GIVE IT TO
HIM AND OTHERS ON THE LEFT
BECAUSE FINALLY THEY ARE
SHOWING THEIR CARDS.
THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE NOT
GOING TO BEAT AROUND THE
BUSH ANYMORE.
WE ARE FOR OPEN BORDERS AND
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE TAKING NOTE.
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THIS
COUNTRY IS TELLING YOU
EXACTLY WHAT THEY STAND FOR.
AND IF THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU
STAND FOR, WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S NOT THE PARTY FOR
YOU.
PETE: ABOLITION OF NATIONAL
BORDERS.
STEVE: MAKING IT VERY CLEAR
WE HAD SOME PRIMARIES
YESTERDAY SCATTERED ACROSS
THE NORTHEAST YESTERDAY,
TOMI.
IT'S VERY CLEAR IT WILL BE
TO VOTERS IN NOVEMBER WHICH
PARTY ARE YOU FOR?
ARE YOU FOR THE OPEN
BORDERS, TAKE BACK THE
CRUMBS PARTY OR THE OTHER
PARTY WHICH YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR?
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY
CHOICE FOR ME, GUYS.
