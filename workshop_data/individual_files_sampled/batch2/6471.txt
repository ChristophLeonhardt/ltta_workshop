you're gonna love this podcast he's gonna have some of the top comedians and comedy writers on there so if you want to check that out along with the entire audio network go to T y-t-dot-com slash audio under Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach for several years believe about six years at this point the state has been requiring you to provide proof of citizenship to be able to register to vote that was constitutional and thus therefore it was struck down by a federal judge just recently a US District Judge Julie Robinson wrote that the state's requirement that voters show proof of citizenship during registration violated both the Constitution and the National Voter Registration Act Robinson struck down the law and ordered that Secretary of State to take six additional hours of continuing legal education that pertain to federal or Kansas civil rules a procedure or evidence we've talked about Kris Kobach before on the show he was the head of the fraudulent voter fraud committee that donald trump set up to try to show that millions of people had voted illegally in the 2016 election they couldn't do that and it was disbanded and he's previously been found in contempt of court for continuing to do things that he has been told he cannot do to try to suppress the vote and we've got that in this case as well the Topeka Capital Journal reported Wednesday that staff for Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach has directed County Clerk's to continue requiring voters to present documentary proof of citizenship so they set up this new thing court says no that's clearly unconstitutional stop it and he says no screw the courts we don't live in a country of laws anymore what are you gonna do even if you threw me in jail I'd be pardoned the next day so I'm just gonna keep doing it and we have a comment from his spokeswoman they said that state officials still need time to fully understand the court's ruling I don't think that unconstitutional is that complicated for him to understand but she argued that the judge did not provide a clear timeline for when Kovac had to instruct County Clerk's to implement the policy and I will let you determine if the timeline was clear in her next quote which says I think immediately is kind of open to interpretation haha that's awesome is it is it really at some point is open to interpretation when you can get around to it is open to interpretation immediately is the exact opposite of open to interpretation so there's parts of the story that I love parts of the story that I hate so the parts that I love are obvious the I mean what is immediately really mean this I'm gonna interpret it as meaning after the elections after I already robbed you of your chance to vote hey I'm just trying to interpret the court right no that's why the judge used the word immediately because they didn't want you to play games like that they didn't want you to wait till after the election and they knew that if they said anything but immediately that that's what you would do so the court said immediately and you still said yeah I don't think so so the second thing that I love is that he that Kovac was ordered to take continuing legal education mm-hmm like you're obviously not getting it I don't know if you're a lawyer or you understand the laws actually a Harvard graduate who earned his law degree at Yale and was a law clerk at the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit he also taught constitutional law as a professor at the University of Missouri Kansas City so the judge is actually being kind to him so she's like well you what you appear to be doing is ignoring court orders which should put you in jail so but I'm gonna order continuing legal education because apparently Yale didn't do the job okay this is my order what you are doing is unconstitutional you must follow my order cuz I am a judge that's how our rule of law works and so of course he knows what she's saying and he's choosing not to do it because they don't believe in the rule of law and so that's the part that I can't stand it's not just that the voters are being blocked actively and they do they they don't if you said to me or so Republicans aren't doing it and you got a chance you can fix the elections by making sure less Republicans vote by doing these kind of tricks oh well you know in the areas that are named and demographically more likely to vote Republican I'm gonna require birth certificate and a passport and a driver's license and and three different cable bills well that way you'll get robbed them of their chance to vote would I take that opportunity no no that the ends do not justify the means their ends are terrible too but the the means is what we call democracy and voting and they don't want people that they think are more likely to vote Democratic a lot of times minorities to vote they don't want to vote so they block them in every way that's why it's unconstitutional but even more disturbing than that is him saying I'm not I'm just not gonna follow the court order what are you gonna do about he's running for governor I think that I'm gonna become governor I'm gonna continue to ignore what you're doing because I don't believe in our form of government with three different branches I think that like Trump he probably thinks well I'm in the executive branch I can do whatever the hell I want and you can't check me well you're not a king the whole point of the court system is checks and balances to make sure that you're following the law and as usual another Republican law breaker because they have no respect for our country or our system of government two easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is
