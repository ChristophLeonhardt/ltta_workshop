1
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:04,081
A couple of years ago,  in the main square of a small Turkish town, 

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:05,549
this statue was taken down.

3
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:08,664
It’s the statue of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk

4
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:10,110
founder of the Turkish Republic

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,813
who transformed the country into a Western-looking secular state.

6
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:19,797
“Islamic tradition is shattered, a man’s image, Mustafa Kemal, is displayed in public,

7
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:28,272
he also orders all Turks to adopt Western style family names and is himself 
christened Ataturk, father of the Turks”

8
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:29,272
But here it was

9
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:33,202
the father of the Turks being wheeled away to a lesser spot across town,

10
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:36,475
and all this in the birthplace of one man in particular…

11
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:40,315
Announcer at rally shouting: "Recep Tayyip Erdogan"

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,675
The order to move the statue is a powerful symbol of the future

13
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:51,947
“the new Turkey, the great Turkey, the pioneer Turkey has won."

14
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:59,043
This is the story of how Erdogan has consolidated power 
 allowing him to recast Turkey in his own image

15
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:08,497
The most pivotal elections in modern Turkish history are taking place in June.

16
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:11,426
Erdogan currently holds the title of president.

17
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:16,387
And if he wins the vote, the once ceremonial 
position will become the nexus of political power.

18
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:19,145
Ahead of it, he has one major promise:

19
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:24,306
"Turkey will wake to a new era"

20
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:27,832
That's an expression that really begs for explanation.

21
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:31,146
Onur Ant reports for Bloomberg in the Turkish capital, Ankara

22
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:37,174
We have been hearing it for some many years now, 
but we don't really know what new Turkey is going to be like.

23
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:40,667
Erdogan could eventually hold power until 2028. 

24
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,476
Signalling what some call stability and others a dictatorship.

25
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:49,684
It is amazing that there's very little that we know about him as a man,

26
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:54,422
despite the fact that he spent more than nearly three decades
in Turkish politics.

27
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:55,790
Here's what we do know.

28
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,934
Erdogan's rise to power began in the 1990s when he was elected as the Mayor of Istanbul.

29
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,359
He quickly became known for his powerful speeches…

30
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:10,188
“We did this for the love of God. I swear we did it for love, really. That was our aim”

31
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:16,925
But in 1999 he was sent to prison after reading a 
religious poem which broke Turkey’s rules on secularism.

32
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:22,674
Erdogan thought about that time in jail as a period where he really put his thoughts together,

33
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:27,590
and that really contributed to the political persona he has turned into later.

34
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,796
Erdogan won a landslide victory in 2002 with his Justice and Development Party, or AKP.

35
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:38,490
As Prime Minister, he ushered in what appeared to be a Golden Age - building schools and roads,

36
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,247
introducing free healthcare 

37
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:44,696
and beginning peace talks with the Kurdish minority based in the south-east of the country. 

38
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:52,481
Erdogan also led an economic recovery which saw 
inflation drop and the average annual growth rate reach 5.8%.

39
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:58,799
He promised there will be no corruption, there will be no poverty,  he was quite impressive.

40
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,135
Asli Kandemir is a finance reporter for Bloomberg based in Istanbul

41
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:08,727
and he pushed an Islamist agenda gradually, and slowly.

42
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,618
Certain changes like…

43
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:17,714
his promotion of religious education, tighter laws on alcohol, and strictures on daily life,

44
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:24,107
…created a divide between Turkey's religious classes 
and those who thought they undermined the country's secular foundations.

45
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:30,302
Things came to a head in 2013 when a group of 
environmentalists held a protest in the heart of Istanbul.

46
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:35,441
Seeing the protests as an extension of the 
Arab Spring movement, Erdogan cracked down hard.

47
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,547
It quickly turned out into a broader show of anger, 

48
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:43,648
and the critics called Erdogan to resign.

49
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:47,621
But one of the biggest tests to Erdogan's leadership was yet to come…  

50
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:56,297
In July 2016 a faction of the Turkish military launched a coup, 
bombing Parliament and killing more than 250 people.

51
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,859
we saw F16s basically running over our heads, running just above our heads,

52
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:05,062
dropping bombs to places that are
literally hundreds of meters away from our houses,

53
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:06,953
ground shaking beneath our feet.

54
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:13,960
It was unexpected, it was shocking a huge majority 
of the population felt really betrayed that night.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,942
Erdogan appeared via Facetime urging people to take to the streets.

56
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:20,878
The call was answered.

57
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:29,398
In a country which had seen 4 successful military 
interventions since 1960, this one failed and Erdogan’s popularity rating soared.

58
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:35,747
It was a dramatic time for the Turkish population and 
the president really emerged as the savior of democracy,

59
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:37,860
at least for a part of the population,

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,552
In the aftermath a state of emergency was declared,

61
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:44,311
allowing the government to rule while disregarding routine procedures. 

62
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:57,502
“The most important feature of the state of emergency is to defeat terrorist organisations, 
wherever they are hiding and bury them”

63
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:05,510
Tens of thousands of Turks have been jailed and many have also lost their jobs…

64
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,020
people from all walks of life, doctors, civil servants, 
people who painted the walls in the parliament.

65
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,202
Access to websites including Twitter, Facebook and 
YouTube has also been repeatedly blocked...

66
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:20,750
And today Turkey jails more journalists than anywhere else in the world.

67
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,276
This has attracted a lot of critics from the western governments,

68
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:28,768
from right groups and from civil society in turkey.

69
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:36,442
They've been saying that Erdoğan is using the
state of emergency to target opposition figures.

70
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,824
As the elections approach a shrinking economy and currency crisis

71
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:45,852
have left Erdogan's “New Turkey” in the balance and the country’s divide just keeps growing.

72
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:54,767
For his supporters, he's a reformist and a revolutionary 
leader who has changed the landscape of Turkey

73
00:05:54,767 --> 00:06:03,865
but for his opponents, he's an autocratic leader who is 
trying to undermine the secular establishment of the country.

74
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:07,269
So as the statues of one Revolutionary are being taken down

75
00:06:07,269 --> 00:00:00,000
his opponents fear that an autocrat's may be rising.
