WOW, THAT IS KIND OF COOL. ABBY: THAT IS GOOD NEWS. STEVE: SIGN OF THE TIMES. BACK IN 2015 THREE AMERICAN FRIENDS ON A TRIP THROUGH EUROPE THWARTED A TERROR ATTACK ON A PLANE HEADING TO PARIS. THEY WERE HONORED INTERNATIONALLY, REMEMBER THIS, THEY EVEN STARRED IN A CLINT EASTWOOD MOVIE ABOUT IT EARLIER THIS YEAR. ABBY: ONE OF THOSE HEROES, FORMER OREGON NATIONAL GUARDSMEN ALEX SKARLATOS IS HOPING TO GO FROM PROTECTTER TORE POLITICIAN. HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW. ALEX, GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON WITH US. YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS THING. YOU WANTED TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE AND POLITICS SINCE YOU WERE A YOUNG KID. WHAT CHANGED? MY STANDING IN THE COMMUNITY. RECENT EVENTS KIND OF PUT ME IN THE NEWS AND I HOPE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE AND SHED LIGHT ON SOME ISSUES AFFECTING MY COUNTY AND REALLY KIND OF THAT IS NOT TREATING PEOPLE VERY WELL. STEVE: IN PARTICULAR UP THERE IN THAT PART OF THE NECK OF THE WOODS LITERALLY IN OREGON. YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIMBERLAND. YOU WANT THE COUNTY COMMISSION TO BE ON IT TO HELP REGULATE? YEAH. OUR NATURAL RESOURCES ARE NOT ONLY GOING TO WASTE BUT THEY'RE BEING HORRIBLY MISMANAGED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T LET US USE ANY PART OF OUR TIMBERLANDS, HARDLY AT ALL. THE BEST PART, THEY LET THEM BUILD UP, THEY CATCH FIRE BECAUSE OF ALL THE I GUESS, MISMANAGEMENT, NOT SPINNING FOREST AT ALL, WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE FOREST FIRES THEY CAUSE. ABBY: ALEX, YOUR BACKSTORY IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. NOT EVERY ONE HAS THAT RUNNING FORS. YOU SPENT YOUR LIFE HELPING PEOPLE. MOST RECENTLY PEOPLE KNOW YOU FOR STEPPING UP DURING THE TRAIN INCIDENT IN FRANCE AND ONE. HEROES TO HELP SAVE PEOPLE. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HELP YOU WHEN YOU'RE CAMPAIGNING, CONNECT TO PEOPLE, REMIND THEM AT ULTIMATE END OF THE DAY IT IS ABOUT BEING THERE FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND HELPING THEM? YEAH. YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE IN SOME DIFFERENT WAYS. EVEN IF IT'S JUST CALLING 911, EVEN IF YOU CAN'T HELP IN DIRECT WAY. IF YOU SEE A CAR ACCIDENT, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. POLITICS I THINK MIGHT BE A STRETCH BUT, I JUST WANT TO HELP MY COMMUNITY IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. I MEAN LIKE I SAID, AFTER EDUCATING MYSELF AND SEEING HOW BADLY THIS COUNTY AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN MISMANAGED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IT IS REALLY PRETTY SICKENING AND I WANT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP MY COUNTY OUT. STEVE: WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE IMAGES OF YOU ACCEPTING REWARDS THROUGHOUT EUROPE. YOU MET THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHEN YOU WERE WITH THE WAR LEADERS, WERE YOU THINKING TO YOURSELF, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE THAT POLITICIAN THING IS SOMETHING I COULD DO? HONESTLY, NOT REALLY. I WAS, I WAS PROBABLY THINKING ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT. BUT THE WHOLE, THE WHOLE POLITICS THING JUST KIND OF, LIKE, ITS HAS BEEN CREEPING UP IN MY MIND A LITTLE BIT BUT, WHAT REALLY MOTIVATED ME WAS JUST SEEING MY OWN COUNTY PANNED JUST TRYING TO GET AHOLD OF OUR BUDGET ISSUES AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING TO WASTE. PEOPLE IN MY COUNTY, LIKE DRUG USE ISTHE RISE. IS ON THE RISE. SO MANY PROBLEMS COME FROM UNEMPLOYMENT. THE GOVERNMENT HANDS US WELFARE. WHICH DON'T WANT IT. WE WANT TO GO BACK TO WORK. THEY WON'T LET US. IT'S SAD. ABBY: ALL YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH YOUR LIFE, LIFE IS FRAGILE. YOU HAVE TO LIVE IT EVERY SINGLE
