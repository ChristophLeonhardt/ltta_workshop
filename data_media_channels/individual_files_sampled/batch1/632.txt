the UK Labour Party has been hit by accusations of anti-semitism in recent months especially against its leader Jeremy Corbyn his fellow Labour MP Margaret Hodge who lost members of her family in the Holocaust said Corbin was an anti-semitic racist while three of the main Jewish newspapers in the UK described him as an existential threat to British Jews the Labour leader has been accused of sharing platforms with Holocaust deniers and making offensive remarks about British Zionists his supporters though argue that Corbin is a lifelong anti-racist and that the attacks against him are smears designed to discredit his strong support for Palestinians and prevent criticism of Israel so is the Labour leader really guilty of anti-semitism or even of turning a blind eye to it joining me from London to debate this are Michael Rosen an award-winning novelist and poet and a Jewish Corbin supporter and Daniella Peled a writer and contributor to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz a former foreign editor of the Jewish Chronicle and a Jewish Corbin critic thank you both for joining me in the arena at Danijela speaking on Wednesday at its party's annual conference in Liverpool Jeremy Corbyn said we will work with Jewish communities to eradicate anti-semitism both from our party and wider society he says there's a problem he says he's dealing with it that doesn't sound like an anti-semite does it mr. Corbyn has not won the confidence the support the vast majority of British Jews and although you can find his supporters of cherry-pick do Jewish people who are speaking out in support of him I've never seen such a consensus amongst this very very diverse community feeling that Labour is no longer a comfortable place for them and for our global audience who haven't been following the details of this how would you sum up in kind of if you can sum it up why the British Jewish community has this consensus that Labour is no longer a comfortable place for them well mr. Corbyn is part of traditionally far left of labour who have quite a binary view of the world divided up into nice anti-imperialists like Iran Russia Assad Syria and the nasty Western imperialists like America Israel NATO the EU as well and in this very binary reading of Foreign Affairs Jews end up as white imperialist and I think this worldview has now become quite dominant in the party and that makes Jewish feed people people who are not really that bothered about Israel one way or another feel that they are being sidelined and being discriminated against and most importantly that when they say this is anti-semitism and they call out instances yeah of prejudice they're told that this is somehow a smear Michael Rosen it's not all a smear is it well I think first we're gonna have to back back a bit and sort out some definitions here we talk about the Jewish community as if there is just one community it's not really strictly speaking true and there are plenty of Jews in the labour party I'm not in the labour party but I support Jeremy Corbyn Michael just to be clear do you at least recognize we can argue about the numbers but a big chunk of the British Jewish community is unhappy with labor under Corbin because they perceive it as not a safe space or a comfortable space or a friendly space for British Jews you concede that is the perception even if you disagree with the reasoning behind it yes of course it you know absolutely but then of course exactly as Daniella says a large percentage of the Jewish community if that's what we're going to call it large percentage of Jews are in favor of Israel but not all Jews some aren't and I have no attachment to that place over there but of course I understand that plenty of Jews do plenty of Jews are brought up to believe that Israel is their homeland even if they don't make it their homeland it is there for them as they believe of course but there are the people living there this is the crucial point about Israel there are other people not recognized by the recent nation-state law Danijela how much of this is to do with the israel-palestine conflict with this thorny debate over Zionism anti-zionism when you do have the Chief Rabbi and the former Chief Rabbi of the UK both saying that anti-zionism is a form of anti-semitism it does muddy the water when we're trying to work out what is bigotry what is hatred what is legitimate political criticism doesn't well I think the real problem here is this accusation that critics of Corbin Jewish critics of Corbin are criticizing him as part of a smear campaign because their real interests are in defending Israel apparently all they're all conservative voters who are weaponizing anti-semitism as this political tool and that feeds straitens always classic anti-semitic tropes but I've been exposed to as well mostly as a reporter writing about Israel Palestine that Jews are more loyal to each other and by extension Israel than the countries that they live in and the countries that they're citizens of now this doesn't jeremy corbyn's comments about Zionists not understanding irony a classic example of this kind of attitude that I've experienced over and over again and I think that is the most wounding and the most damaging part of this whole thing Michael it sort of drill down into labor and jeremy corbyn i want to get your sense of where you stand here is your position that jeremy corbyn that he's done nothing wrong and that this is a smear campaign from the right or from supporters of israel or is it your position that perhaps he's used bad language in the past or he's said the wrong thing or does he have a blind spot for this stuff maybe that's what some have suggested supporters of his where do you stand I think the basic mistake if he has made mistakes is he hasn't been vocal enough in defying and picking back if you like because he's not a linguist he's not he's a politician and he thinks that he has an honorable thing to do which is to support the rights of justice and peace in the Middle East and justice for the Palestinians and he thinks that has nothing to do directly with discrimination against Jews discrimination against Jews or indeed prejudice against Jews in Britain that's what he thinks by and large I agree with Daniella why it would be interesting to know from you then what would be my motivations as a lifelong labor voter for saying there is a real problem with anti-semitism in labor and my part of the smear am I in the a part of a conservative smear or being funded by the Israeli embassy there are plenty of people who stand up for Palestinian rights and say there is a problem you're tying yourself in knots to try and justify what's not justifiable when Boris John made his really rather unpleasant comments about Muslim women looking letterboxes people dealt with those comments as they were on their merits or rather their lack of merits no one was saying this is part of a left-wing conspiracy trying to derail a potential government led by Boris Johnson let's look at what he has said and judged on its merits and those merits are very lacking well as it happens Daniella I haven't said it's a right-wing conspiracy or anybody's conspiracy sitting here if some people do well you know they've worked out that maybe there are some relationships between Jews in Britain and Israel and Israelis I'm not saying that though I what I would say is that the media in this country was very reluctant there's no allegations of smear most vocal hang-on were most vocal about it had had very important positions and recognized positions in the Conservative Party all right and so had those links and indeed the ex chief rabbi was a great great very fond of Margaret Thatcher so it's not as if the only agenda these people had in attacking Corbin well all I'm saying is that just to not investigate other reasons why people might want to attack a labor leader is quite important you remember the last Labour leader we had was attacked for having a father who was a Jewish traitor by a Tory newspaper The Daily Mail Ed Miliband who was the first Jewish leader of the Labour Party didn't win a majority of Jews support in 2015 and a lot of their anti-semitism cases at a local level on it did turn up on his leadership you know on his watch so his some would say it is unfair to put this all at Corbin's door the bad relationship between the Labour Party and British Jewish communities would you concede that I think as I said I think it's part of a symptomatic of a wider issue the fact that his leadership has emboldened a section of the far left that has always held these really rather extreme views towards British Jews as being wealthy as being part of the ruling class that's been capitalist and being imperialists and Corbett has not taken significant action he hasn't spoken out and he hasn't apologized or made comments patience if any kind he has apologized to believe me he has apologized several times there has an ephah for making mistakes for not dealing with this soon enough and he's now come out this week in the conference and said we want to eradicate and Semitism we won't tolerate this in the party he is repeatedly common supported Jews over twenty years he's partly supported early day motions as we call them in the House of Commons here supported Jews count ten times over the last twenty five years so you know he's no Viktor Orban I will say to you that of course there is a problem as there is in the whole society I'm repeating if you like exactly what John Landsman the leader of one of the supporting groups but there are plenty of Jews in the labor party I came from a left-wing Jewish tradition that thought that one of the ways we could deal with our problems universal values one of the ways wish to join labor and socialist parties Michael just on the issue of the problem Daniels idea Danielson Daniella is saying that you're you know you're denying the problem you're saying there's a problem in labor as therein as there is with the rest of society korban himself said in a statement recently anyone who denies that this is surfaced in our party is clearly actually wrong and contributing to the problem it's not enough to just say well everyone's that got anti-semitism problem and therefore do a bit of what about ISM is it I agree because obviously the Labour Party is founded on universalistic ideas of human rights it claims to be an anti-racist party so of course that Jeremy Corbyn will say well we we do have a problem if we have any anti-semites in the labour party there may be anti-semites out there in society but it's our job to root it out of the labour party indeed so let me ask you this daniela before we finish what is the solution moving forward for this fort relationship between british Jews and the Labour Party under Corbin is there a solution or is it too late I'm afraid I can't see one right now I think that there's been a lack of effort to show goodwill a lack of communication and I think this extends to a wide range of issues I have personally more problems with the Labour Party's view on Syria or on Ukraine and other Foreign Affairs issues than I do on israel-palestine but i think the gap is just too large and Trust has been eroded no it's a long time to come Michael Trust has been eroded how does Jeremy Corbyn get it back or can he not get it back I don't know I'm no great crystal ball gaze up at the interesting thing here is the question to ask is are those people who are opposed to Jeremy Corbyn over this matter are they interested in eradicating anti-semitism or are they interested in eradicating Jeremy Corbyn that's what the plotting all this summer and before has been about let's get rid of Corbin Michael Rosen Daniella Peled we'll have to leave it there thank you very much for joining me in the arena that's our show upfront we back next week you
