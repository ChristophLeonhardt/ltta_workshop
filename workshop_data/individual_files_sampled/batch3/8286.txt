THINK WILL BE ON THE TABLE IN NOVEMBER, SHEP. Shepard: CATHERINE HERRIDGE ON CAPITOL HILL. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. Shepard: THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN ROLLED INTO CRIMEA TODAY AND HE DID IT IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF A TRUCK. BECAUSE PUTIN, HE WAS SHOWING OFF A NEW BRIDGE THAT LINKS SOUTHERN RUSSIAN TO THE CRIMIAN PENINSULA. REALLY? AND YOU WONDER WHY HE INVADED THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. REMEMBER THE AREA HE DECIDED TO TAKE AWAY FROM UKRAINE I SHOULD SAY BACK FROM UKRAINE BACK IN 2014. THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF A VICTORY LAP. AT THE TIME THE WORLD SAID THE REASON HE IS DOING IT IS HE WANTS THIS BRIDGE. HE NEEDS A WARM WATER PORT.
