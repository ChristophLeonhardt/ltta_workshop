A PENNSYLVANIA PASTOR WAS CAUGHT IN HIS VEHICLE IN A WELL LIT NEIGHBORHOOD. HE WAS IN THE BACKSEAT AND IN THE FRONT SEAT WAS A MAN WHO WAS NAKED AND TIED BY NYLON ROPE. I WAS THAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY NAKED AND AFRAID. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE WAS AFRAID. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS A CONSENSUAL SITUATION. BUT NONETHELESS, PASTOR GEORGE NELSON GREGORY MADE A BAD DECISION WHEN HE PARKED HIS NEIGHBORHOOD IN A WELL LIT NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE IT WAS EASY FOR PEOPLE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. ONE RESIDENT ACTUALLY CALLED THE COPS BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD SEE THE NAKED MAN FROM HER BEDROOM WINDOW. WHEN THE COPS SHOWED UP, THEY FOUND THE SITUATION AGAIN THE PASTOR WAS IN THE BACKSEAT NAKED, TIED UP MAN WAS IN THE FRONT SEAT AND THE STORY SEEM TO CHANGE BASED ON GREGORY'S ACCOUNT. LET ME GIVE THE DETAILS. BLESS YOUR HEART. HE ALSO SAID: LATER HE KIND OF SWITCHED UP HIS STORY. HE SAID COPS TOTALLY MADE THAT UP. HE NEVER MADE THOSE STATEMENTS. IN FACT, HERE'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. HE SAID: OKAY, BOOK. IF HE HAD LEFT AS THE FIRST STATEMENT, I DID NOTHING WRONG AND IT WAS CONSENSUAL BY THE WAY, THE NAKED MAN SAYS IT WAS CONSENSUAL. WE ARE DONE WITH IT, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. BUT HE BRINGS HIS WIFE INTO IT. HE SAYS MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN COUNSELING THIS GUY, THE TRUCK THING. WHAT IS THE DRUG THING HAVE TO DO WITH A NYLON ROPE? AND HE SAYS THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO. THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO AS HE TOOK HIS SHIRT OFF AND THEN HIS PANTS AND THEN HIS UNDERWEAR AND THEN HIS SOCKS? AND THEN HE TIED HIMSELF UP IN THE NYLON ROPE? THERE WAS STILL NOTHING YOU COULD DO? MY GOD, GETTING OUT OF THE CAR, YOU OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T DO THAT BUT YOU HAD TO STAY IN COUNCIL THE GUY. I HAVE TO JUMP IN. PART OF ME IS IRRITATED WITH THIS PASTOR BECAUSE OF THE HYPOCRISY. THE L BG T COMMUNITY FACE DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME STILL DUE TO THE STABLE PART OF ME FEELS REALLY BAD FOR HIM BECAUSE HE'S BEEN LIVING THIS LIFE FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT MUST BE A TERRIBLE EXISTENCE SO I HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR HIM AND I HOPE THAT ONE DAY HE CAN LIVE HIS AUTHENTIC SELF, HIS AUTHENTIC LIFE. IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF ANA KASPARIAN, YOU DO YOU, BOO. IF YOU WANTED TIED IT UP WITH NYLON ROPES, HAVE AT IT. BUT JUST DON'T DENY WHO YOU ACTUALLY ARE.
