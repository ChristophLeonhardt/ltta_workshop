CATHERINE HERRIDGE SAID PETER

87

PROMISE.

THINK ABOUT THE IG HEARING?

94
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,810
>> Greg: I BELIEVE STRZOK'S

95
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,845
TEXTS ARE MORE INCRIMINATING IN

96
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:52,512
TERMS OF CONSPIRACIES THAT

97
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,113
ANYTHING IN THE RUSH OF

98
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:54,314
COLLUSION THINK THAT I WAS

99
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:56,249
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

100
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:59,186
WHAT WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO

101
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:02,089
WRITING "STOP TRUMP," WOULD BE

102
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,657
TRUMP TEXTING: CALL PUTIN.

103
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:05,292
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HITLER.

104
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:06,993
THAT WOULD BE THE SMOKING GUN.

105
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:08,595
THE BIG STORY TO ME AS ALWAYS

106
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:09,596
WHEN TO BE TREY GOWDY'S

107
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:14,868
EVER-CHANGING HAIR.

108
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:16,336
HE IS LIKE MARTIN LANDAU IN

109
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:19,573
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

110
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:20,674
HE'S GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE.

111
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:24,845
HE IS A RUSSIAN AGENT.

112
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:26,246
>> Dana: SAY CIA OR SOMETHING.

113
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:29,049
>> Greg: I THINK HE WORKS FOR

114
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:29,483
THE RUSSIANS.

115
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:30,817
>> Donna: NATIONAL MAN OF

116
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:31,151
MYSTERY.

117
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:33,153
I THINK THE BEARD IS VERY

118
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:34,388
BECOMING.

119
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:35,789
POLITICS SOMETIMES IS NOT SO

120
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:36,256
BECOMING.

121
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:37,858
I ACTUALLY DID WATCH.

122
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:38,525
IT'S BETTER THAN WATCHING

123
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,260
SOAP OPERAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

124
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,527
DAY.

125
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:43,864
THE REASON WHY I WATCHED IT IS

126
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:46,066
BECAUSE UNDERNEATH ALL THE

127
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,868
PARTISAN RHETORIC ABOUT THAT, WE

128
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:49,369
LEARNED THAT ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE

129
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,438
AN AGENCY THAT HAS SOME

130
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:51,838
DYSFUNCTION.

131
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:53,206
WHETHER YOU FOCUS ON THOSE

132
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:57,878
EMAILS, TEXTS, DISGUSTING.

133
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:00,080
I'M A FORMER FEDERAL EMPLOYEE.

134
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,847
DISGUSTING.

135
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:01,481
LET'S SAY.

136
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,449
IT'S DISGUSTING.

137
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,116
WHETHER YOU'RE SAYING THOSE

138
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,585
THINGS ABOUT MR. TRUMP OR SAYING

139
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:09,790
THOSE THINGS ABOUT MRS. CLINTON.

140
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,291
THEY ARE NOT HIRED TO TEXT EACH

141
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,059
OTHER ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL

142
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:14,060
DISLIKE OF A PARTICULAR

143
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,795
CANDIDATE.

144
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:17,197
THAT BEING SAID, THE OFFICE OF

145
00:04:17,197 --> 00:04:17,930
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY MUST

146
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,099
NOW DO THEIR JOB AND REMOVE

147
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:22,067
THOSE WHO ARE STILL IN THE

148
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:22,636
EMPLOY OF THE FEDERAL

149
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,036
GOVERNMENT.

150
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:24,337
BEYOND THAT, I THINK THIS REPORT

151
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:27,674
TELLS US A LOT ABOUT MR. COMEY

152
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,443
STATE OF MIND, THE FACT THAT HE

153
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:30,510
WAS INSUBORDINATE.

154
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,279
HE BELIEVED HE ALONE COULD

155
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,947
DELIVER THE SO-CALLED MESSAGE TO

156
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:34,915
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

157
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,450
DIDN'T HAVE TO CHECK WITH HIS

158
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:36,750
BOSS.

159
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,084
THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN IN THIS.

160
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,219
I HAVEN'T READ ALL OF IT BECAUSE

161
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,988
AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO

162
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:42,355
PICTURES.

163
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:44,257
I READ FASTER WHEN I SEE

164
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:44,658
PICTURES.

165
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:45,892
BUT IT IS A STORY THAT WE NEED

166
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:46,226
TO KNOW.

167
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,929
BY THE WAY, YOU AND I CAN HAVE A

168
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,063
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RUSSIANS.

169
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:51,865
I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT OF THE

170
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:52,499
LANGUAGE NOW BECAUSE I DO

171
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:54,301
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GET TO

172
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:55,702
THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED.

173
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:57,270
>> Greg: I AM MARRIED TO A

174
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,473
RUSSIAN SO I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE.

175
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:02,108
>> Jesse: SPEAKING OF COMEY,

176
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:03,877
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CONFIRMS

177

COMEY'S HANDLING OF THE

178
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,080
CLASSIFIED MEMOS IS UNDER

179
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,514
INVESTIGATION.

180
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,483
EVERYONE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.

181
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:11,551
>> Greg: WE WILL BE SOON.

182
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,153
>> Donna: CAN WE DO ANOTHER

183
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:16,890
KUMBAYA AT THE END OF THE

184
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,224
SEGMENT?

185
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:18,658
>> Greg: THESE THINGS ARE LIKE

186
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:19,793
SOCCER.

187
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:23,663
IT IS LIKE 0-0 AT HALFTIME.

188
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,665
IT'S LIKE SOCCER.

189
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:26,199
0-0 AT HALFTIME.

190
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,234

WAS A TIE.

192
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:30,270
I THINK IT WAS A SLAM DUNK.

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,904
