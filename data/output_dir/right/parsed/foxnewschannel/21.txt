>> Shannon: THE SUPREME COURT
COULD SOON HEAR ANOTHER WEDDING
CAKE.
THIS TIME FROM CHRISTIAN BAKERS
IN OREGON WHO WERE HIT WITH A
MASSIVE FINE AND FORCED TO CLOSE
THEIR BUSINESS AFTER REFUSING TO
BAKE A CUSTOM WEDDING CAKE FOR A
LESBIAN COUPLE.
IF THEY HAVE NOW OFFICIALLY
APPEALED TO THE U.S.
SUPREME COURT.
JOINING ME NOW, MELISSA AND
AARON KLEIN, THE COUPLE WHO OWN
SWEET CAKES BY MELISSA AND KELLY
SHACKELFORD FROM FIRST LIBERTY
INSTITUTE HEADING UP THEIR LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.
GREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU WITH
US.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
PICKLE THANKS FOR US ON.
>> Shannon: I HAVE BEEN
FOLLOWING YOUR CASE FOR YEARS AS
THIS IS BEEN GOING ON.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO
ALL THE TWISTS AND TURNS BUT YOU
DID LOSE YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU'VE GOT A BIG FAMILY.
HOW ARE YOU ALL FARING NOW?
>> AARON IS WORKING AT A JOB.
HE'S PAYING THE BILLS.
>> Shannon: YOU GUYS ARE
SURVIVING.
DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD MAKE IT
TO THE SUPREME COURT?
NOW THE JUSTICES WILL HAVE TO
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CAKE T
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CAKE K
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CAKE E
YOUR CASE BUT IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL END UP.
>> WE REALLY HOPE SO.
>> WE ARE HOPING THEY WILL TAKE
THE CASE.
>> Shannon: YOU ARE LEADING
THE EFFORT.
I WANT TO READ SOMETHING THAT
YOU PUT IN THE PETITION.
YOU SAID THEY SERVED ALL
CUSTOMERS REGARDLESS OF
ORIENTATION, THIS WAS AN
EXPRESSION OF THEIR FAITH, WHICH
TEACHES THAT ALL PERSONS ARE
MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND ARE
THEREFORE DESERVING OF DIGNITY.
WE KNOW THE CLIENTS HAVE SERVED
THIS COUPLE BEFORE, BUT IT
WASN'T UNTIL THEY CAME FOR A
CUSTOM WEDDING CAKE THAT THE
RELIGIOUS ISSUE CAME TO THE
FOREFRONT AND I KNOW THAT YOU
WERE REALLY HAMMERING ON FREE
SPEECH ISSUES AS WELL AND HOPING
TO GET THE COURTS TO TAKE THIS
CASE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO ANY
AMERICAN.
THEY'VE BEEN FINED $135,000, HAD
THEIR BUSINESS CLOSED.
IF THERE ACTUALLY WAS A GAG
ORDER TELLING THEM NOT TO SPEAK
PUBLICLY THEIR BELIEFS ABOUT
MARRIAGE.
AND THIS IS A GREAT CASE FOR THE
COURT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
AND REALLY DISPOSE OF IT FOR THE
WHOLE COUNTRY.
THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER WE HAVE
FREE SPEECH OR WHETHER THE
GOVERNMENT CAN COME TO PEOPLE
AND SAY YOU WILL SPEAK OUR
MESSAGE THAT WE WANT YOU TO
SPEAK OR WE WILL SHUT DOWN YOUR
BUSINESS.
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER SET OF
FACTS WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED TO
MELISSA AND AARON AND I WANT
PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING US TO
REALIZE THIS IS NOT JUST MELISSA
AND AARON.
IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO THIS TO
THEM, THEY CAN DO THIS TO YOU.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO
REALLY BE PRAYING FOR AARON AND
MELISSA.
GO TO FirstLiberty.org.
YOU CAN PRAY FOR THEM, YOU CAN
FOLLOW THEIR CASE.
BUT THIS IS A GREAT CASE FOR THE
COURT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
AND HOPEFULLY PROTECT ALL
AMERICANS.
>> Shannon: WE KNOW THE LAST
BIG CASE BEFORE JUSTICE KENNEDY
ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT REALLY
DIDN'T RESOLVE THE QUESTION BUT
YOU KNOW FOLKS ON THE LEFT AND I
GOT A STACK OF QUOTES AND
ARTICLES FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY WHAT
YOU ARE ASKING FOR IS A LICENSE
FOR PEOPLE TO DISCRIMINATE BY
USING THEIR RELIGION.
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
AS YOU MENTIONED, THEY SERVE AT
EVERYBODY.
THEY SERVED THIS COUPLE.
IT'S ONLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING
ASKED OR FORCED BY THE
GOVERNMENT TO EXPRESS A MESSAGE
THAT THEY CAN'T IN THEIR OWN
CONSCIENCE EXPRESS THAT THERE'S
A CONFLICT.
AND WE'VE ALREADY BELIEVED THAT
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T FORCE
PEOPLE TO SAY THINGS THEY DON'T
BELIEVE.
IF WE EVER GIVE THE GOVERNMENT
THAT POWER, GOD FORBID WHAT
HAPPENS TO OUR FREEDOMS IN THIS
COUNTRIES.
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CASE
FOR EVERY AMERICAN.
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT BELIEFS ON
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BUT I THINK
WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE
DIFFERENT BELIEFS ON SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE.
>> Shannon: WOULD YOU DO THIS
AGAIN HAD YOU KNOW WHERE THIS
WOULD TAKE YOU?
>> AGAIN, THIS IS NOTHING WE
WOULD EVER WANT TO HURT ANYBODY
WITH.
WE NEVER WANTED TO BE IN THIS
SITUATION BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT
DON'T TAKE IT BACK.
WE HAVE TO LIVE OUT OUR
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THAT'S
WHAT WE AIM TO DO.
>> Shannon: THIS WILL SOON GO
TO THE JUSTICES FOR A PRIVATE
