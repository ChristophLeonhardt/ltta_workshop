I made a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> in December of 2010 when</font>

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,569
I was stranded in New York because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,490
was lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of snow in the UK and in that</font>

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,099
video I asked you all for ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what</font>

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,650
to do to keep me<font color="#CCCCCC"> entertained and I took</font>

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,480
one suggestion from a youtube user

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,340
called pretty fascinated who said make

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,740
origami paper cranes and plant them in

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,960
different places around the hotel now I

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,019
did this but I was followed and the

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,699
person who followed me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a very</font>

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,609
unhappy cleaning man as a result I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,439
hid the rest of them the teeny tiny ones

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,989
especially around the room I felt kind

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">of guilty the whole time because I</font>

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,800
wondered who<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the housekeeping</font>

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,300
you're gonna have to clean this up oh no

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,219
oh no but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,020
something a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit crafty rather than just</font>

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting back and watching TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or playing</font>
