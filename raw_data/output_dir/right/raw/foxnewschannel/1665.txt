1
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:03,856
FIRST THE RESISTANCE FOR

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:05,124
AMERICA'S FAILURE.

3
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:12,865
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:13,198
"ANGLE."

5
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:15,401
KIM JONG-UN IS THREATENING TO

6
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:19,204
CANCEL THE JUNE 12th PEACE

7
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:19,538
SUMMIT.

8
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:24,877
DEMOCRATS REJOICED.

9
00:00:24,877 --> 00:00:27,813
YES, THEY DID THE NORTH KOREA

10
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:30,549
DICTATOR'S FOREIGN MINISTER IS

11
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:34,019
TAKING ISSUE WITH U.S. MILITARY

12
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:39,625
EXERCISES UNDER WAY WITH SOUTH

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:39,958
KOREA.

14
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,827
EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE EXERCISES

15
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:47,433
THAT ARE CONDUCTED EVERY SINGLE

16
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:48,033
YEAR.

17
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:52,638
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE AGITATED

18
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:56,008
THAT THE HERMIT KINGDOM SHOULD

19
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,876
COMMIT TO A COMPLETE

20
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:58,744
DENUCLEARIZATION SIMILAR TO

21
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:00,979
LIBYA IN 2004.

22
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,148
THAT REALLY SET THE NORTH KOREA

23
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:04,717
FOREIGN MINISTER OFF.

24
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:06,985
HE SAID IT'S A MANIFESTATION OF

25
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:11,623
A SINISTER MOVE TO IMPOSE ON OUR

26
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:11,957
DIGNIFY

27
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:11,990
DIGNIIE

28
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,793
DIGNIIED

29
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:14,827
DIGNIIED S

30
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:14,860
DIGNIIED STA

31
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,262
DIGNIIED STATE

32
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:17,296
DIGNIIED STATE T

33
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:19,231

00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:19,264

DIGNIIED STATE THE DESTIN

37
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:20,733
DIGNIIED STATE THE DESTINY:

38
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,768
WELL, NORTH KOREA VACILLATION

39
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:24,870
AND THE BAIT AND SWITCH ROUTINE

40
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,704
IS TYPICAL.

41
00:01:25,704 --> 00:01:27,740
IT WAS PROBABLY EXPECTED BY THE

42
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,474
TRUMP TEAM.

43
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,976
WHAT I SAW AND HEARD WHEN I WOKE

44
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:33,445
UP THIS MORNING WAS EVEN MORE

45
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:35,314
DISTURBING THAN WHAT NORTH KOREA

46
00:01:35,314 --> 00:01:37,349
IS PULLING HERE.

47
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,918
AMERICAN COMMENTATORS WEARING

48
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:43,255
THEIR, "SEE I TOLD YOU SO"

49
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,757
SMIRKS, REVELING IN WHAT COULD

50
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:47,926
BE BAD NEWS FOR THEIR OWN

51
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,428
COUNTRY.

52
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:52,231
THEY WERE DANCING ON THE GRAVE

53
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:55,134
OF THE PEACE SUMMIT.

54
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:56,969
FOR THE SOLE REASON IT WOULD

55
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,003
EMBARRASS PRESIDENT TRUMP.

56
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:01,273
IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORY, YOU

57
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:03,609
WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL

58
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,144
ABOUT BEING BRAGGING.

59
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:06,812
>> I MEAN THIS.

60
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,781
DONALD TRUMP HAS AN ARK VERSION.

61
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:19,458
HE IS ALLERGIC TO COMPLEXITY AND

62
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:19,575
A

63
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:20,392
ALLERGIC TO HISTORY.

64
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:22,861
>> THEY ARE RATTLING HIS CAGE.

65
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,763
>> I THINK THERE WAS A TENDENCY

66
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:27,766
FROM THE PRESIDENT TO BE DOING

67
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,601
AN END ZONE DANCE IN

68
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,036
ANTICIPATION OF HAVING SCORED

69
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:31,403
SOMETHING.

70
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:34,439
HE IS DOING THE END ZONE DANCE

71
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:40,245
ON HIS OWN 20 YARDLINE.

72
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,748
>> Laura: DO YOU THINK HE EVER

73
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:44,650
PAID FOOTBALL.

74
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,486
THE FORMER FBI CHIEF SAID THIS

75
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:51,023
TURN OF EVENTS IS UNSURPRISING,

76
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:54,059
SINCE DONALD TRUMP SEEMS

77
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:58,564
ENAMORED WITH A FAIR, AIM, READY

78
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:04,837
POLICY THAT IS:

79
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:08,273
IT SOUND LIKE THE CIA.

80
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:11,310
MAYBE IN THE MEDIA WERE NOT SO

81
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,681
UPSET WITH ALL THINGS STORMY OR

82
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:18,851
RUSSIAN COLLUSION THEORIES,

83
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,587
MAYBE THEY COULD SEE HOW PETTY

84
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:24,823
AND UN-AMERICAN THEY SEEMED

85
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:25,123
TODAY.

86
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,826
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

87
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:29,027
POSSIBILITY OF DOING SOMETHING

88
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:30,128
PROFOUNDLY GOOD FOR THE UNITED

89
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,631
STATES AND FOR OUR ALLIES

90
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,867
THROUGHOUT ASIA.

91
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,201
ACHIEVING PEACE AND BRINGING

92
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,302
NORTH KOREA OUT OF THE DARK AGES

93
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:38,704
OF HUMAN RIGHTS.

94
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:41,840
THAT'S A CRITICAL OBJECTIVE.

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,709
LET'S NOT FORGET, TRUMP HAS

96
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,245
ALREADY DONE THE UNEXPECTED.

97
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:49,948
HE HELPED LIBERATE AMERICAN

98
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:51,550
HOSTAGES FROM NORTH KOREA'S

99
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,784
HANDS AND OPENED UP THE

100
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,052
POSSIBILITY FOR REAL PEACE.

101
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,922
HE CHANGED THE DYNAMIC.

102
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:58,523
THE STATE DEPARTMENT TODAY SAID

103
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:01,093
THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL INDICATION

104
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:03,295
FROM NORTH KOREA THAT THE SUMMIT

105
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:08,066
IS OFF AND RIGHT NOW THE

106
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:11,403
PRESIDENT IS PLANNING TO BE

107
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:11,703
THERE.

108
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:12,404
EVERY UNITED STATES CITIZEN

109
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:14,106
SHOULD WANT THE SUMMIT BETWEEN

110
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:17,576
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN TO HAPPEN.

111
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,279
OF COURSE, FOR IT TO BE

112
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,846
SUCCESSFUL.

113
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,649
THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF

114
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:25,350
THOUSANDS INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE AT

115
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,185
STAKE HERE.

116
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,955
ENDING THE POSSIBILITY OF

117
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:31,690
THERMO-NUCLEAR WAR, THAT'S MORE

118
00:04:31,690 --> 00:00:00,000
IMPORTANT THAN SCORING CHEAP
