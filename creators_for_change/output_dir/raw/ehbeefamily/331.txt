have a nut wondering how do you eat an avocado

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,110
I don't get why those people like using

21
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,690
like carving inside  I've no idea why they do that

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,260

23
00:01:44,350 --> 00:02:01,050
so the next thing from my bag is

24
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,340
a skate bored so i love skate boreds because there so easy to ride

25
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,710
and there the best for transprtation

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,289

around the world and that's something

40
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,080
that you really need to use your mind

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,989

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,180
pause the video and go down to the comments

70
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,580
