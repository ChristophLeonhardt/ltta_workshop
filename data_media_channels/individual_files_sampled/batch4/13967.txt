Lefty's might say well there was the federal assault weapons ban they just made up that term matter what's an assault weapon I think all weapons are assault weapons or anything so we see this trend broadly by by your count anywhere from ten point two to ten point eight willful killings per hundred thousand people in nineteen eighty number way way down drops by fifty percent just from 93 to twenty thirteen just within those twenty years violent crime way down since 1991 the overall homicide rate way way down by twenty fourteen we're looking at four point five people per 100,000 Americans so lefties might say well there was the federal assault weapons ban they just made up that term matter what's an assault weapon I think all weapons or assault weapons or anything but it is it has dropped that's true they make a good point however let's look a little more carefully because it seems so clear doesn't it but all shallows are clear federal assault weapons ban expired fourteen years ago nevertheless the trend continued it was enacted in 1994 a decade later it was expired it wasn't renewed but the trend in the drop in crime continued to drop so there is no evidence that the so-called assault weapons ban has had any effect whatsoever on murder or crime rates even the Washington Post admits this by the way so even the Washington Post where democracy dies in darkness admits on the wonk blog in a piece in 2015 we've had a massive decline in gun violence in the US here's why now some of their explanations are more compelling than others for one they note the increase in cops that we've hired that there are more police officers on the beat gun violence murder crime they all start to decline around the time of the assault weapons ban but the so-called assault weapons ban the the so-called assault weapons crimes didn't really change I think the reason that people see that coincidence is that also at this same time in 1994 President Clinton signed sweeping crime bills and there were other crime bills all throughout the United States and major cities New York in particular but that funded law enforcement agencies nationally added a hundred thousand officers nationally at a time when law enforcement agencies were already expanding economist Steven Levitt estimates larger police forces reduced crime by five to six percent gun violence and declined with crime generally at this point
