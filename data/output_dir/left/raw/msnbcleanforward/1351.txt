00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,150
I HOPE SOMEONE IS GOING TO LOOK INTO THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP

37
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,352
INTO THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A 40-YEAR HISTORY OF LEANING

PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE SAY

165
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,677
AISLE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE SAY THIS WAS STANDARD, IT WAS

166
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,613
THIS WAS STANDARD, IT WAS OPPOSITION RESEARCH.

167
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:46,616
OPPOSITION RESEARCH. THAT ARGUMENT HAS TAKEN HOLD.

168
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,219
THAT ARGUMENT HAS TAKEN HOLD. >> I THINK THEY HAVE MADE THAT

169
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,020
>> I THINK THEY HAVE MADE THAT ARGUMENT BUT I DON’T THINK IT

170
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:52,955
ARGUMENT BUT I DON’T THINK IT WILL TAKE HOLD ENOUGH.

171
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,757
WILL TAKE HOLD ENOUGH. AT THAT POINT YOU LOSE ENOUGH

172
00:05:54,758 --> 00:06:00,029
AT THAT POINT YOU LOSE ENOUGH PARTY MEMBERS THAT IMPEACHMENT

173
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,964
PARTY MEMBERS THAT IMPEACHMENT BECOMES A POSSIBILITY.

174
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:04,067
BECOMES A POSSIBILITY. IF THERE IS REAL COLLUSION ON

175
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,535
IF THERE IS REAL COLLUSION ON THE WIKILEAKS.

176
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:07,270
THE WIKILEAKS. >> YOU THINK IT CHANGES THINGS.

177
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,274
>> YOU THINK IT CHANGES THINGS. >> YOU ARE MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN

178
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:14,644
>> YOU ARE MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I BECAUSE MAYBE FOR THE PAST TWO

179
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,747
I BECAUSE MAYBE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE WITNESSED THIS.

180
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:19,649
YEARS, WE HAVE WITNESSED THIS. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WOULD WAKE

181
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,986
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WOULD WAKE UP AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS

182
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,021
UP AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS A BRIDGE TOO FAR.

183
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,790
IS A BRIDGE TOO FAR. HOW MANY BREACHES DO WE NEED?

184
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,394
HOW MANY BREACHES DO WE NEED? >> I AM SAYING AS A PRACTICAL

185
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:35,398
>> I AM SAYING AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THE DEMOCRATS END UP

186
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,833
MATTER THE DEMOCRATS END UP WINNING THE HOUSE.

187
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,668
WINNING THE HOUSE. >> IF RUSSIA DOESN’T COLLUDE.

188
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:41,004
>> IF RUSSIA DOESN’T COLLUDE. >> IT LOOKS FOR NOW THAT THE

189
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:42,672
>> IT LOOKS FOR NOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL WIN THE HOUSE IF

190
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:46,176
DEMOCRATS WILL WIN THE HOUSE IF THEY DO AND IF THERE IS REAL

191
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:50,080
THEY DO AND IF THERE IS REAL EVIDENCE ON THE COLLUSION OR THE

192
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,082
EVIDENCE ON THE COLLUSION OR THE OBSTRUCTION SIDE, THAT IS A REAL

193
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:52,382
OBSTRUCTION SIDE, THAT IS A REAL CRIME.

194
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:53,016
CRIME. IT IS A FEDERAL CRIME.

195
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,285
IT IS A FEDERAL CRIME. IF IF YOU ARE THE HOUSE OF

196
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,420
IF IF YOU ARE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WHAT DO YOU

197
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:56,687
REPRESENTATIVES, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

198
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,722
SAY? WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOOK INTO

199
00:06:58,722 --> 00:06:58,989
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOOK INTO IT?

200
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:01,024
IT? THEY AT LEAST HAVE HEARINGS.

201
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:03,460
THEY AT LEAST HAVE HEARINGS. >> THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

202
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:07,731
>> THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH

203
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:08,098
TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH KAVANAUGH.

204
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:12,235
KAVANAUGH. I THINK TODAY -- MUCH LESS

205
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:12,536
I THINK TODAY -- MUCH LESS LIKELY.

206
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,706
LIKELY. ONCE YOU GET INTO REAL

207
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,341
ONCE YOU GET INTO REAL IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS, AND REAL

208
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,009
IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS, AND REAL LOOKING INTO THE EVIDENCE, IT IS

209
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,811
LOOKING INTO THE EVIDENCE, IT IS HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO SAY, WELL,

210
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,314
HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO SAY, WELL, EVIDENCE IS A CRIME.

211
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:24,848
EVIDENCE IS A CRIME. I THINK IT CHANGES.

212
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,817
I THINK IT CHANGES. >> I WANT TO MAKE ONE FINAL

213
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,052
>> I WANT TO MAKE ONE FINAL POINT WHICH IS THAT TRUMP, IF HE

214
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:30,621
POINT WHICH IS THAT TRUMP, IF HE DID CONSPIRE WITH THE RUSSIANS,

215
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,156
DID CONSPIRE WITH THE RUSSIANS, AND ALL EVIDENCE POINTS TO HIM

216
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,525
AND ALL EVIDENCE POINTS TO HIM DOING THAT, THEN HE DID IT IN A

217
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,260
DOING THAT, THEN HE DID IT IN A WAY THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD DO

218
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,398
WAY THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD DO IT, WHICH WOULD PRESERVE

219
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:52,175
IT, WHICH WOULD PRESERVE PLAUSIBLE DENYIBILITY.

220
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:55,880
PLAUSIBLE DENYIBILITY. TO PRESERVE THAT KIND OF

221
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,981
TO PRESERVE THAT KIND OF PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.

222
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:59,150
PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY. IF WE TAKE THAT TO BE TRUE, AND

223
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,687
IF WE TAKE THAT TO BE TRUE, AND PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL COHEN ARE

224
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,588
PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL COHEN ARE FOUND TO HAVE TRAVELED TO PAWING

225
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,790
FOUND TO HAVE TRAVELED TO PAWING TO PAY OFF THESE HACKERS, IF

226
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,094
TO PAY OFF THESE HACKERS, IF TRUMP HIMSELF DIDN’T DO IT, THEN

227
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:14,465
TRUMP HIMSELF DIDN’T DO IT, THEN I CAN SEE THE REPUBLICANS

228
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:16,100
I CAN SEE THE REPUBLICANS SAYING, WELL --

229
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:20,071
SAYING, WELL -- >> TO WHICH DONALD TRUMP COULD

230
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:22,106
>> TO WHICH DONALD TRUMP COULD RESPOND WELL, HE WAS GIVEN A

231
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:22,506
RESPOND WELL, HE WAS GIVEN A PLEA DEAL.

232
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,208
PLEA DEAL. >> THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY

00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:24,709
>> THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT.

234
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,410
WANT. I AM NOT DEFENDING THE

235
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:26,810
I AM NOT DEFENDING THE REPUBLICANS.

236
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:31,149
REPUBLICANS. THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF

237
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:33,718
THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF RATIONALIZATION THAT IS

238
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:34,085
RATIONALIZATION THAT IS POSSIBLE.

239
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:35,019
POSSIBLE. >> YOU ARE OPTIMISTIC.

240
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,420
>> YOU ARE OPTIMISTIC. >> WE HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT.

00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,560
TAPES. WHAT ARE ON THEIR TAPES.

00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,648
>> THESE ARE PEOPLE WAITING FOR THE N-WORD THREE DAYS AGO.

251
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:05,350
THE N-WORD THREE DAYS AGO. WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS

252
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,752
WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SURROUNDED HIMSELF AND POSSIBLY

BOROUGHS FOR DECADES. THE SEPARATION OF POWER IS NOT

259
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,475
THE SEPARATION OF POWER IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN

260
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,477
WORKING BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN HAS NOT STOOD UP TO THIS

261
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,378
HAS NOT STOOD UP TO THIS PRESIDENT NOT ONCE.

00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:38,883
VERDICT FROM MANAFORT. EVEN IF COHEN HAS TURNED HIMSELF

00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:39,151
EVEN IF COHEN HAS TURNED HIMSELF IN.
