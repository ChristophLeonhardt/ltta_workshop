everything's wrong and all their

120
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,610
divisions I mean there are people

128
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,420
I mean Hillary Clinton's speech was one

129
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,060
of the dullest thing she that woman I

130
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,970

134
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,949
the problem the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is who she is</font>

for wanting to limit Muslim immigration

151
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,789

Trump responds on the George

186
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,419
Stephanopoulos show and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

187
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I can say about Donald Trump is he</font>

188
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,889
tried not to be himself he gave his the

189
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,690
best thing I can say about him is Donald

190
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,699
Trump tried for a few minutes not to be

191
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,199
Donald Trump so here's his first

192
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,630
response to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the con speech with</font>

193
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,310
Stephanopoulos he was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know very</font>

194
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,470
emotional and probably looked like a

195
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,190
nice guy to me his wife if you look at

196
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,020
his wife she was standing there she had

197
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing to say she probably maybe she</font>

198
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,500
wasn't allowed to have anything to say

199
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,030
you tell me but plenty of people have

200
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,150
written that she she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely quiet</font>

201
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,639
and it looked like she had nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

202
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,860
say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people have said that and</font>

203
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,310
personally I watched him I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> him the</font>

204
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,030
best of luck he tries he's trying not to

205
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,380
be Donald about like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> outlet and</font>

206
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,220
Donald

207
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,780
I'm to meet Oliver to use health's the

208
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,210
godswife in sort of making making the

209
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,370
point that because she's a Muslim woman

210
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,920
she's not to say anything and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

211
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,510
she responded she writes him a very

212
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">eloquent letter telling him to get</font>

213
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,670
stuffed as he deserved you know shut up

214
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,320
all you had to say was<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that's very</font>

215
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,350
sad but but it was Hillary Clinton who

216
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,720
voted for the Iraq war not Donald Trump

217
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
it was Hillary Clinton who when the

218
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,890
going got tough started to stand against

219
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,950
the Iraq war turned her back on Captain

220
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,840
Khan and his fellow soldiers it was

221
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,090
George W Bush<font color="#CCCCCC"> ruinin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and fought for</font>

222
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,260
those guys and gave him the search

223
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,850
against everybody's advice against

224
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,610
everybody's urging<font color="#E5E5E5"> george w bush went in</font>

225
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,530
and won that war essentially with a

226
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,690
surge so Trump has nothing to apologize

227
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,370
for there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you know he's talking</font>

228
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,599
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else as he makes this</font>

229
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
point here's the second cut when<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,159
you say to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> father well I'd say</font>

231
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,049
we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of problems with radical</font>

232
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,990
Islamic terrorism that's what I'd say we

233
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a lot of problems where you look at</font>

234
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,580
San Bernardino you look at Orlando you

235
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,950
look at the World Trade Center you look

236
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,570
at so many different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

237
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,010
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to the priest over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

238
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,200
weekend in Paris where his throat was

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,930
cut eighty-five-year-old beloved

240
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Catholic priest you look at what</font>

241
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,680
happened in Nice France a couple of

242
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks ago I'd say you got to take a look</font>

243
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that because something's going on and</font>

244
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,310
it's not good fair enough right i mean

245
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,570
that's what he's talking about he's

246
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,070
talking about Islamic terrorism we all

247
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,690
know that there are great islamic

248
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">patriots around that's not the point</font>

249
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,680
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in the Islamic world</font>

250
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,720
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cancer of violence we don't</font>

251
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">know whether it grows in you know its</font>

252
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,490
inherent in Islam itself that's the

253
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,930
great question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the age I think a lot</font>

254
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,120
of people should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> studying that but we</font>

255
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,010
do know that it's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

256
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,510
problem is is that if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

257
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">get blown</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shot</font>

258
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,890
it's probably going to be by an Islamic

259
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,150
guy and that's what he's worried about

260
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,270
which is fair enough but it just can't

261
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,250
stop you know there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

262
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,290
guy it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he doesn't want to win</font>

263
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I can't speak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that I don't</font>

264
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,710
know maybe he's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole thing as</font>

265
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,020
a lark but when he is personally

266
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,410
attacked he personally attacks back he

267
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,750
has not got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing in him that most</font>

268
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,610
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us have where they say you know what</font>

269
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,530
maybe this wouldn't be the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

270
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,840
maybe this person you know has a

271
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,700
to be emotional or angry it doesn't make

272
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,800
you know the fact that their child died

273
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,330
heroically doesn't make their political

274
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,160
point any better he could have there was

275
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,650
a way to respond I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes I know</font>

276
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,710
Hillary Clinton has essentially dist

277
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,750
patricia smith brought home those

278
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,330
coffins from Benghazi and lied and stood

279
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,490
by those coffins and lied into the faces

280
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,920
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those parents it's inexcusable but</font>

281
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,720
this is all so ridiculous to hear

282
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,490
Stephanopoulos asks him has he

283
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,220
sacrificed anything he said you have

284
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,280
sacrificed nothing and no one well that

285
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds who wrote that did Hillary's</font>

286
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,180
script writers write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would you</font>

287
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,740
answer that father what sacrifice have

288
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,150
you made for your country I think I made

289
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,940
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sacrifices I work very very</font>

290
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,850
hard I've created thousands and

291
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,890
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jobs tens of thousands of</font>

292
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">jobs I think those are sacrifices oh</font>

293
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,780
sure I think those sacrifices<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

294
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,850
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can employ thousands and</font>

295
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,680
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people take care of their</font>

296

education<font color="#CCCCCC"> take care of so many things</font>

297
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,780
even in military mean I was very

298
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,770
responsible along with a group<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

299
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">for getting the Vietnam Memorial built</font>

300
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,730
in downtown Manhattan which to this day

301
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,510
people thank me for I raised and I have

302
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,220
raised millions of dollars for the vets

303
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,500
I'm helping the vets a lot I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think my</font>

304
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,450
popularity with the vets is through the

305
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,520
roof are you the vets it reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of</font>

306
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> story you remember the story of the</font>

307
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,640
frog and the Scorpion the Frog says the

308
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,870
Scorpion says to the Frog take me across

309
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> river and the Frog says will won't</font>

310
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,530
you sting me in the Scorpion says no I

311
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,640
wouldn't sting you because then we'll

312
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,100
sink and we'll both drown so he the Frog

313
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's the Scorpion ride on his back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

314

halfway across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> river the scorpion</font>

Clinton for a minute cuz Clinton now as

349
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,480
it's all about Trump this is a turning

350
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,160

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait and see what the people's</font>

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,240
reaction to this is but meanwhile

358
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,520
meanwhile hilary clinton gives an

investigation FBI director James Comey

364
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,880
said none of those things that you told

365
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,030
the American public we're true Chris

366
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,800
that's not what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard director Comey</font>

367
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,960
say and I thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for giving me the</font>

368
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,930
opportunity to in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> view clarify</font>

369
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,060
director Comey said that my answers were

370
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,610
truthful and what I've said is

371
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,720
consistent with what I have told the

372
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">American people that there were</font>

373
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,150
decisions discussed and made to<font color="#E5E5E5"> classify</font>

374
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,970
retro actively certain of the emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

375
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,840
was communicating with over 300<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

376
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,560
in my emailing they<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly did not</font>

377
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,800
believe and had no reason to believe

378
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,810
that what they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending was</font>

379
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,450
classified now in retrospect different

380
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,430
agencies come in and said well it should

381
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,190
have been

382
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,870
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what was happening in</font>

383
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,200
real time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she lies again and</font>

384
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,850
then we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to stop here just</font>

385
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,870
for a minute and say goodbye<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

386
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,310
friends on Facebook come over the daily

387
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:52,590
wire and hear the rest of the show so so

388
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,690
comee the entire nation heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Comey call</font>

389
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,030
her a liar point after point after point

390
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,940
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> Illustrated he'd investigated this</font>

391
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,770
for months and months and he said you

392
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">know she said this but this wasn't true</font>

393
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,310
but she's still that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I heard</font>

394
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not you know in Clinton world in</font>

395
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,080
my imagination everything's fine so

396
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,970
Wallace goes after again and she still

397
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,530
does it listen listen to this he plays

398
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,630
the he plays the tape for in a

401
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,430
what you had told the public sector

402
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,960
Clinton said there was nothing marked

403
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,180
classified on her emails either sent or

404
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,550
received was that true that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not true</font>

405
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,470
Secretary Clinton said I did not email

406
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,900
any classified material to anyone on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

407
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,180
email there is no classified material

408
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,130
was that true that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was classified</font>

409
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,620
material email he directly contradicted

410
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,720
well I let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just touch that he not</font>

411
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,310
only directly contradicted what you said

412
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,500
he also said in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing that you</font>

413
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,370
were extremely careless and negligent

414
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,500
well Chris I looked at the whole

415
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,360
transcript of everything that was said

416
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,510
and what i believe is number one I made

417
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">a mistake not using two different email</font>

418
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,470
addresses I have said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> repeat</font>

419
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">it again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today it is certainly not</font>

420
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I ever would do again I</font>

421
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,680
take classification seriously I relied

422
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
on and had every reason to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

423
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,320
judgments of the professionals with whom

424
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,220
I worked and so in retrospect maybe some

425
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are saying well those among those</font>

426
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,680
300 people they made the wrong call at

427
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,800
the time there was no reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my view</font>

428
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,910
to doubt the professionalism and the

429
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,100
determination by the people who work

430
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,500
every single day on behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

431
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,410
country so she throws<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire state</font>

00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,600
department under the bus

433
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,880
yeah yeah okay it may look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lied</font>

434
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,770
but it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> their fault you know</font>

435
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,510
she's a terrible human these people they

436
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">should really get married they should</font>

437
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">really get married and leave the rest of</font>

438
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,230

<font color="#CCCCCC">each other on top of which I have to say</font>

believe that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

Constitution and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand</font>

when people say oh you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

448
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,439
shouldn't torture our prisoners why

449

there may be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for that or why</font>

450
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,589
you know you can't stop the press from

451
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,630
saying what they want to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I truly</font>

452
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,609
believe that my problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that Hillary</font>

00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,530
Clinton has read the Constitution and

she wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to destroy it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know every</font>

she means the First Amendment because

460
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,870
all citizens united says is that you do

461
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,370
not lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> your First Amendment rights</font>

462

when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you form a corporation if I form a</font>

463

corporation with the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room</font>

464
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we make a film criticizing Hillary</font>

465
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,230
Clinton we do not lose our right to

466
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,390
publicize that film before an election

467
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,190
because it's a corporation giving money

468
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,990
she says oh that's corporate donations

469

that's all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in a political context</font>

471
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,710
money is speech and so when she says<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ban money enforced exclosure</font>

477
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,130

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,990
NBC and ABC and when they do get work

535
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,670
they can't get their stuff on and they

536
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,380
have to leave you know I mean shall

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,210
Atkinson who's not a conservative just a

538
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,680
good investigative reporter had to leave

539
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,420
CBS because they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let her bring</font>

540
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,800
they wouldn't let her run stories

541
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,550
critical of Barack Obama so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

542
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,310
are so awful that the prospect of their

543
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,590
horror and shocked if Donald Trump gets

544
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,780
the elected at least gives me a little

545
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,910
bit of pleasure but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only pleasure</font>

546
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,830
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this and and I</font>

547
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,240
guess I do think that there's this

548
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,220
infinitesimally at that Donald Trump

549
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,440
will do what he says he will do and

550
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,380
appoint conservative Supreme Court

551
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,570
justices where I know Hillary Clinton is

552
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,220
going to appoint a Supreme Court justice

553
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,740
to overturn Heller your gun rights take

554
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,030
away your gun rights take away your

555
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,470
First Amendment rights I know she's

556
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,000
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do those things so I had this</font>

557
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,400
slight slight preference for Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

558
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,910
he's also he's a terrible person and he

559
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,010
and he will endanger the polity I mean I

560
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the question is</font>

561
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,880
whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress will restrict them</font>

562
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,929
and I think they're more likely to do

563
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,480
that with Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> than with Clinton so</font>

564
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,490
just it what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say it's it's</font>

565
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,600
election 2016 run for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life start</font>

568
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you never see anybody paddling</font>

569
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,929
the trying to get to Cuba they're all

570
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:29,160
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out of you but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

571
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,490
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this election mhm all right let's</font>

572
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like you know this is</font>

573
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,390
Jason Bourne is not the stuff I like

574
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,330
it's a it's a b-movie it's a good movie

575
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,470
I said that there's not gonna be any

576
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,480
spoilers and there's not but if you

577
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,950
haven't seen there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a spoiler</font>

578
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bourne Identity the first film</font>

579
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to assume that you know who</font>

580
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,350
jason bourne is that he is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guy who</font>

581
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,169
lost his memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> he found out he's a CIA</font>

582
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,270
assassin and he wants out he doesn't

583
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,100
like the fact that he's a killer he's

584
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,450
now a trained killer and he doesn't want

585
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,570
to be that guy so the latest one is one

586
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,520
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> shaky cam things that the</font>

587

<font color="#E5E5E5">what'swhat's green grass what's his</font>

591
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,600
be active and you know you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

592
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,919

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,330
the Bourne films since the first one

605
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,010
which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my favorite films I</font>

606
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,480
bourne identity is one my favorite

607
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,880
thrillers so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment when</font>

608

born basically expresses his philosophy

609
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,309
because he remembers who he is I don't

610
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:53,580
want to do it anymore I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

611
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:01,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decision you can make Jason</font>

612
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,740
Bourne is dead you hear me<font color="#E5E5E5"> he drank two</font>

Waterloo I don't know if the story is

632
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,700
true but it makes it into a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

633
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,560
biographies about Wellington he's riding

634

649
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,460
and there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ancillary damage</font>

650
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,810
a lot of women and children getting

651
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,760
killed when he does this but he is

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,710
defending it we have Obama defending

653
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,080
these drone strikes simply put these

654
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,370

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,960
would kill as many Americans as they

could if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did not stop them first so</font>

665
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,510
there's Obama making the argument that

666
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,130
the sniper makes two Wellington now

667
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,690
Wellington says no no that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

670
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,880
the general if one once they start

671
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,290
killing generals you know where does it

672
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,620
stop so but now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all gone here's</font>

673
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,710
Obama the hero<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the left saying no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

674
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,450
kill we assassinate people because

675
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,550
otherwise these assassinations save

676
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,590
lives their drone assassinations but

677
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,920
that's what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so after in the 70s</font>

678
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,960
after we found out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CIA did do</font>

679
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,230
is

680
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,910
fascinations<font color="#E5E5E5"> three precedents in a row</font>

681
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,100
Ford Carter and Reagan passed laws

682
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,040
saying no more assassinations I mean no

683
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,260
more CIA assassinations<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose we didn't</font>

684
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,120
do those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but now we do do from</font>

685
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,710
the president says yeah I'm blowing

686
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,880
people away he said at one point I'm

687
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,169
good at killing i turn it turns out I'm

688
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:53,340
very good at killing people he bragged

689
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,630
about it so now you've got this

690
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,070
left-wing director who's got a problem

691
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,110
because Tommy Lee Jones in this new

692
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,240
Jason Bourne movie plays the evil CIA

693
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,460
director and he says exactly what Obama

694
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,040
just said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Jason point he</font>

695
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,540
says you saved lives by doing these

696
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,299
things on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which by the way we</font>

697
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,610
find out this is not a big reveal in the

698
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,679
movie it's just a plot point we find out

699
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Jason Bourne is responsible for one</font>

700
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,549
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our guys and our agents in Syria</font>

701
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,940
getting captured it because all born

702
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,640
ever does is he exposes evil CIA plots

703
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,890
and he exposes an evil CIA plot one of

704
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,510
our agents in Syria gets captured and

705
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,640
tortured so Jason Bourne in this movie's

706
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,980
the bad guy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I mean I just about</font>

707
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,120
halfway through the movie i stopped

708
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,350
rooting for him<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait you got</font>

709
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,570
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our agents captured in Syria I'm</font>

710
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,620
saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to think</font>

711
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,630
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

712
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,429
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good guy and so it's very very</font>

713
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,530
confusing it started me thinking about

714
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that there is a lot of art that</font>

715
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,020
is good and now this isn't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

716
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,890
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call this art this is</font>

717
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,299
entertainment but there is a lot of

718
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,549
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level art that is good that</font>

719
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:57,419
puts forward bad ideals you know I mean

720
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:59,340
some talented people I mean Eminem this

721
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,929
is just to use a modern example very

722
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">talented lyricist when you listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to him</font>

723
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's a very clever lyrics his stuff is</font>

724
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,080
evil you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> he writes about the things</font>

725
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">he says about women it's just evil stuff</font>

726
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,309
but that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean talent is blind</font>

727
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:13,860
talent falls on anybody it does not care

728
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,750
where it goes it's like the spirit<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

729
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,400
know it just falls on the people that it

730
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,809
falls on some good people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have talent</font>

731
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,640
some bad people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at town and I've talked</font>

732
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559

738
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that led me</font>

739
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to God was reading the Marquis de Sade</font>

740
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,890
is where we get the name sadism who was

741
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,950
a brilliant philosopher and pornographer

742

with integrity for atheism I have ever

749
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,200
read so when I read the Marquis de Sade

750
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,630

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,220
a brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and beautiful film but it</font>

778
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,530
takes these two thugs Bonnie and Clyde

779
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,720
and they were thugs and it turns them

780
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,400
into I mean it's faye dunaway and warren

781
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,260
beatty's of the most beautiful human

782
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,720
beings on earth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're fun you</font>

783
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,910
could hear the narration you know it was

784
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lark they were so in love the</font>

785
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,550
giggles were still these were stone-cold

786
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,440
killers these these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> widowed and</font>

787
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,170
orphaned people in cold blood I think

788
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,000
they killed nine police officers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

789
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,500
cop that who's in there this guy they

790
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,790
call him Frank hammer I think his name

791
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,950
was pronounced a mur I just read his

792
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,570
biography there's a new biography called

793
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,310
Texas Ranger I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an image</font>

794
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah there it is and I just finished</font>

795
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,600
reading this and he was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the great</font>

796
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,390
law men of the 20th century and he his

797
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,000
wife sued the filmmakers and they had to

798
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,010
pay her for slander because I used his

799
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,480
real name like a fool he was never

800
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,640
captured by Bonnie and Clyde he tracked

801
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,410
them down relentlessly and he blew them

802
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,360
away basically he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an old-fashioned</font>

803
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,790
Texas lawman I mean this was a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

804
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,740
grew up in a white supremacist world he

805
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,330
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a white supremacist himself in the</font>

806
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,710
sense that he thought blacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

807
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,280
inferior he risked his life 20 times

808
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,740
against lynch mob sometimes thousand

809
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,780
people strong to defend black people

810
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,310
because that was his sense of justice

811
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,110
even though you know I mean he liked

812
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,220
black people he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought they were</font>

813
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,230
inferior but that didn't stop him from

814
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,810
risking his life sometimes single-handed

815
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,610
like a wet like a sheriff in a western

816
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,680
to stand up for people who were not and

817
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
these and most of these black guys were

818
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,480
criminals and they were guild

819
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,970
but he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not going to let them lint be</font>

820
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,740
lynched so he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great hero in this</font>

821
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,750
movie which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a beautiful movie it</font>

822
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,910
makes violence balletic and beautiful

823
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and poetic it makes these two thugs you</font>

824
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,560
know romantic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and beautiful and it takes</font>

825
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,270
this great lawman and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> landers him</font>

826
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,800
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it basically makes him</font>

827
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,930
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fool and a buffoon which he</font>

828
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,870
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't and so the question then</font>

829
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">becomes what do you do with</font>

830
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,860
entertainment or great art that sells

831
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,550
with values that are despicable and

832
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,780
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to talk about this</font>

833
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,120
more tomorrow but let me just start by

834
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,220
saying that art is an engagement it's

835
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,930
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engage is not</font>

836
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,790
a passive thing you have to bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

837
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,650
values to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the show and you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

838
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,480
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> criticize art and think about</font>

839
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,580
art without coming across or even being

840
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,680
without being stick in the mud without

841
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,960
not enjoying what is beautiful about the

842
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,400
art because there is something there's

843
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,930
always something in great art that's

844
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,720
true i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Marquis de</font>

845
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,610
Sade even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was not the truth</font>

846
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,710
that sod was selling and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

847
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,380
you you are part of the artistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

848
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,170
and have to bring those values to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> processes so we'll talk more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>
