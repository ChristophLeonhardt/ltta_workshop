My name is Guillermo
del Toro, and I’m
the director,
producer, co-writer
of “The Shape of Water."
This is an important
scene because it’s
a scene that sets the
communication between Elisa
and the creature.
It was important in the
story because the way
I introduce the creature
in the screenplay
first is with a shock, very
much like a monster movie,
with a hand against the glass.
Then, I introduce
the fact that he
ate two of the fingers of the
villain in the piece, you know,
the antagonist.
And then I introduce him on
a scene previous to this,
and I keep it on an edge.
You know, I show you an
innocent and a beauty
through the way his
eyes move and look.
But it’s still a
dangerous creature, maybe.
Maybe not.
But there is definitely
a contact between them.
I also show you
that he’s bleeding,
that he has been tortured, so
you know the reaction maybe
was justified.
So in this sequence, I do it —
I knew it was a
prologue to a montage,
so I wanted to keep it very
much stylistically in one piece.
So I do three —
three shots, two of them very
elaborate with a small crane.
And I show you the placing
of the egg, the — the placing
of the record.
Everything is a single shot.
Until we go out to
a wide shot of Eliza,
and it’s a very
quaint composition.
It’s a — it’s very, very
sort of meek, you know?
She’s sitting by the pool
eating her little sandwich.
It’s sort of a beautiful
picnic of — of —
of really intense
oddity, you know?
And — and — and that’s
what the movie is.
The movie is the
marriage of the ordinary
and the extraordinary, which
is a very Mexican vocation,
because it’s the
story of a woman that
falls in love with a river god.
And where does she keep him?
In her bathtub.
So in this montage,
I’m going to show you
symbolic little things that
remind you of her routine
alone.
The — the boiled eggs, which
she used to share alone,
and that have a very
sexual connotation
of activities alone.
The bathtub, she’s
looking at the bathtub,
making plans, perhaps, for
her future with the creature,
you know?
All this is going on with her.
And at the same time,
her love of musicals,
which has been set up in
the movie several times.
I wanted to show her dancing
with the mop like Fred Astaire,
you know, sort of a very
classical musical routine solo,
and the connection between
them through the glass.
They are still not together.
There’s a glass separating them.
And they both — both move
beautifully together,
but they are not
together yet, so there’s
a longing to the scene
that I find very moving.
