"HANNITY."

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:10,826
THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP

4
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:13,129
WENT AFTER THE MUELLER

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:15,164
WITCH HUNT, "TOTALLY

6
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:17,967
CONSTITUTIONAL

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:18,801
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, I WON'T PLAY

8
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,403
THE GAME BECAUSE I, UNLIKE THE

9
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:22,805
DEMOCRATS, DID NOTHING WRONG."

10
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,974
I CALLED HIM THE GREAT ONE.

11
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:28,310
HE'S THE HOST OF "CRT LIVE-IN

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,582
TV," NUMBER ONE SHOW ON FOX --

13
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:35,017
THE IDEA THAT A PRESIDENT CAN BE

14
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,185
INDICTED, I WANT YOU TO DEAL

15
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:36,585
WITH THAT.

16
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:38,888
I WANT YOU TO DEAL WITH THE IDEA

17
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,222
OF PART INS.

18
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:43,392
THIS IS YOUR WHEELHOUSE, MARK

19
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:45,127
THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

20
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:47,029
DONE ANYTHING WRONG, I SEE YOU

21
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,697
GOT YOUR PAPERS AND YOU ARE

22
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:49,699
PREPARED, SIR.

23
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:51,801
GO.

24
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,171
>> NUMBER ONE, THIS INDICTED

25
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:55,871
ISSUE, THE PRESIDENT CANNOT BE

26
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:59,008
INDICTED ACCORDING TO THE

27
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:03,612
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

28
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:04,280
MR. MUELLER IS AN INFERIOR

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,816
EMPLOYEE IN TERMS OF THE

30
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,383
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

31
00:01:07,383 --> 00:01:08,984
HE WORKS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

32
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:09,585
JUSTICE.

33
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:11,153
AND HE MUST COMPLY WITH THE

34
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:12,588
POLICIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

35
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:13,189
JUSTICE.

36
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,423
EVEN PUTTING ASIDE THE

37
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:17,393
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE, HE CANNOT

38
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:18,094
DEFY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

39
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,228
AND BRING IN AN INDICTMENT.

40
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:19,795
I BELIEVE THEY ALREADY

41
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:21,564
UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THEY

42
00:01:21,564 --> 00:01:22,565
WATCH YOUR SHOW.

43
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:23,866
BECAUSE ADDITIONALLY, WE KNOW HE

44
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,167
CAN TO EITHER BECAUSE OF THE

45
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,571
ARGUMENTS LAID OUT BY REPUBLICAN

46
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,005
ADMINISTRATION AND DEMOCRAT

47
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:30,473
ADMINISTRATION.

48
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:31,373
YOU CANNOT CRIPPLE THE PRESIDENT

49
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,174
OF THE UNITED STATES BUT HE'S

50
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,110
THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE

51
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,844
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, EXPECT HIM

52
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,613
TO HAVE HIS DUE PROCESS

53
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:38,314
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS PROPERLY

54
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:40,382
DEFENDED AT THE SAME TIME.

55
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:41,517
NO PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INDICTED,

56
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,185
THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT.

57
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:43,953
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN

58
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:45,888
BROUGHT BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND

59
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:46,789
JURY, THERE IS A REASON FOR

60
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,691
THAT.

61
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,392
PERHAPS MR. MUELLER IS THE ONE

62
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:51,127
WHO WAS THE TYRANT, NOT THE

63
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,028
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

64
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,797
THE APPOINTMENT CLAUSE OF THE

65
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:55,464
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION,

66
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:56,365
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT WRITE

67
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:56,665
THAT.

68
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:58,768
LAST TIME I CHECKED THEM OF THE

69
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:02,037
BY ALL THE STATES.

70
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:04,173
THE DEFECT HERE IS THAT EVERY

71
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,776
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S APPOINTMENT IS

72
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:08,009
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, EVERY SPECIAL

73
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,812
COUNSELOR'S APPOINTMENT IS NOT

74
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:11,313
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

75
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:12,615
THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL'S

76
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:13,682
APPOINTMENT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL

77
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:14,183
BECAUSE THE DEPUTY

78
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:15,885
ATTORNEY GENERAL, MR. ROSENSTEIN

79
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,019
ATTORNEY GENERAL, MR. ROSENSTEI

80
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:17,753
MR. ROSENSTEIN, HASN'T EDUCATED

81
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:20,689
HIMSELF ABOUT THE APPOINTMENT,

82
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:21,123
NORMAN CLAUSE.

83
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:22,124
BUT DOES NOT HAVE

84
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:23,793
THE POWER OR THE PRESIDENT AND

85
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:25,728
THE SENATE.

86
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,930
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES

87
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,765
PRINCIPAL OFFICERS TO COME TO

88
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:30,900
THE SENATE AND THE SENATE MUST

89
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,233
CONFIRM.

90
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:34,670
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, --

91
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,271
UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS,

92
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:38,607
ASSISTANT SECRETARIES.

93
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:40,009
THE PROBLEM IS MR. ROSENSTEIN

94
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,010
CONFERRED SO MUCH POWER ONTO

95
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,945
THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL, NO

96
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,947
SPECIFIC CRIMINAL STATUTES, NO

97
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:49,351
SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS, AND THE

98
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,219
OVERSIGHT IS SO TACIT AND SO

99
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:50,553
LIMITED.

100
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,054
AS HE PROMISED, HE WOULD KEEP

101
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:55,124
HIS HANDS OFF OF MR. MUELLER.

102
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:55,858
HE'S CREATED AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL

103
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:57,760
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

104
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,562
I BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT

105
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:00,930
CHALLENGES THAT ONE DAY, HE WILL

106
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,597
BE SUCCESSFUL.

107
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,999
NOW THE PARDON POWER.

108
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,534
THIS MEMO THEY KEEP REFERRING TO

109
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,470
ON CAPITOL HILL, MR. SCHUMER, OF

110
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,238
ALL PEOPLE, IT'S TWO AND A HALF

111
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:11,974
PAGES LONG.

112
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,776
PAGE ONE?

113
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,143
PAGE TWO?

114
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:14,543
PAGE THREE.

115
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:18,380
SEE MY EXES?

116
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,114
THOSE OF THE RELEVANT PART OF

117
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:19,915
THE MEMO THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO

118
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,750
WITH GOING ON TODAY.

119
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,384
THIS ARTICLE QUESTION MIKE

120
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:25,387
THAT'S IT.

121
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,790
UNDER THE APPOINTMENT OF THAT

122
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,391
NOBODY MAY BE A JUDGE IN THEIR

123
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:31,560
OWN CASE, IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE

124
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,595
QUESTION WOULD BE ANSWERED IN

125
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:33,028
THE NEGATIVE.

126
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,598
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT CAN

127
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:36,799
DO, PARDON HIMSELF.

128
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,400
THIS IS NOT A LEGAL DOCUMENT.

129
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,669
THIS IS A JOKE.

130
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,203
HERE?

131
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:42,004
THERE AREN'T ANY.

132
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:42,972
DO YOU SEE ALL THE CASE LAW

133
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,407
HERE?

134
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:46,542
IT'S A NOVEL QUESTION BECAUSE NO

135
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,177
PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN

136
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:49,011
INDICTED.

137
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,512
WHY ARE WE EVEN DISCUSSING THIS

138
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,615
PART?

139
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:53,849
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," ONE OF THE

140
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,384
REPORTERS IN ONE OF THE

141
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,186
HIGHLIGHTS SECTIONS IN THE PHONY

142
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:58,487
ARTICLE BASED ON THE LEAKED

143
00:03:58,487 --> 00:03:59,955
LETTER PUTS IN THERE, IS THE

144
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:01,490
PRESIDENT SAYING HE CAN PARDON

145
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:01,824
HIMSELF?

146
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,725
OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT CAN

147
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:04,593
PARDON HIMSELF!

148
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:06,595
HERE IS THE LANGUAGE IN THE

149
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,596
CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE TWO,

150
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:07,997
SECTION TWO.

151
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:15,771
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE POWER TO

152
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:16,372
TO -- EXCEPT IN CASES OF

153
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:16,772
IMPEACHMENT.

154
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:17,439
DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING THERE,

155
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,072
EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE

156
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:18,440
PRESIDENT?

157
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,108
ALL OF THESE PROTECTIONS ARE

158
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,011
BUILT INTO OUR CONSTITUTION TO

159
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,480
PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTION, TO

160
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,781
PROTECT THE PRESIDENT FROM THE

161
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:29,184
MOB, THE MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATS

162
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:30,185
THAT ARE A MOB TODAY.

163
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:30,986
THEY ARE HERE TO PROTECT THEM.

164
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:33,322
IT'S NOT THE PRESIDENT VIOLATING

165
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,624
THE CONSTITUTION, IT'S THE MEDIA

166
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:36,759
WHO WANT THE CONSTITUTION

167
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,359
VIOLATED.

168
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,093
IT'S THE DEMOCRATS WHO WANT THE

169
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,796
CONSTITUTION VIOLATED.

170
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:43,832
IT'S MUELLER AND HIS MERRY BRAND

171
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:44,566
OF DEMOCRAT PROSECUTORS TIPPING

172
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,168
AROUND A CONSTITUTIONAL

173
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:46,769
CONFRONTATION.

174
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,404
AS I SAID HERE, EVERY TIME I'VE

175
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:51,774
BEEN IN YOUR SHOW, SEAN, THE

176
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:53,542
CONSTITUTION IS THE PRESIDENT'S

177
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:53,876
FRIEND.

178
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,811
I AM SPEAKING SLOWLY SO EVEN JOE

179
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,645
SCARBOROUGH CAN COMPREHEND WHAT

180
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,213
I'M SAYING.

181
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,348
EVEN CHRIS CUOMO CAN COPPERHEAD

182
00:04:59,348 --> 00:04:59,949
WHAT I'M SAYING.

183
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:00,816
THE PRESIDENT IS IN THIS

184
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:03,986
DECISION BECAUSE OF WHAT IS THE

185
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,187
ROSENSTEIN DID, HE CREATED AN

186
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,055
UNCONSTITUTIONAL MONSTER WHO IS

187
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,556
THREATENING TO BRING THE

188
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,391
PRESIDENT IN FRONT OF A FEDERAL

189
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:10,092
GRAND JURY, WHICH IS

190
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,027
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND HAS NEVER

191
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:14,964
BEEN DONE, WITH THIS NOTION OF

192
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,832
