hello development in the Julian Assange case the WikiLeaks co-founder has been granted an Ecuadorian ID card as a step towards ending his five-year confinement in Ecuador's London embassy Laura Smith is across the story after a while of nothing no movement from inside the Ecuadorian Embassy there's been a series of developments in the last 24 hours Julian Assange posted a photograph of himself in an Ecuadorian football shirt which gave rise to a lot of speculation about what that could mean he generally doesn't do things unless they mean something and then we saw reports surfacing from Quito which said that he had received a national identity number so he's been entered into the tax register essentially which is something that will only happen to citizens of Ecuador so the strong suggestion is that from this national identity number he will then possibly get a passport we went onto the streets of quito to see how people there felt about it he does need Human Rights support and I think that's what the government will give him there is also a health issue because we know he's enclosed in a very small space there are many things that cross my mind is he healthy enough to stay there the best is to use a refugee policy and supports him in this way this follows a statement earlier this week from the Foreign Minister of Ecuador saying that the situation of Assange living here in the embassy is unsustainable and asking for the first time for a third-party mediator either another country or another person to see if they could help to resolve this issue where the person can't live in those conditions forever and we're considering the option of mediation we're not with us at all that could be done via a third country or individual who knows no solution is possible without international cooperation or without that of the UK which has expressed interest in finding one and it's no wonder that she wants the resolution because of course it's been five and a half years since I saw it first went into the embassy behind me because there have been developments in his case along the line most notably possibly last year Sweden dropped the investigation into their sex allegations against him but the UK authorities still say if he sets foot outside this embassy they will arrest him because he of course jumped bail when he went into the embassy and WikiLeaks still fears a non-word extradition to the United States so what we're seeing Ecuador making moves quite concerted moves to try and resolve the situation but the UK government still remains intractable on the issue so even after all this time it's very unclear when and what will be the ending of this saga the UK Foreign Office has refused a request from Ecuador to grant Assange diplomatic immunity in a letter to us the FCO stressed that it would not discuss the matter except to say that the case would only be resolved if Assange leaves the embassy and faces justice we spoke with WikiLeaks supporter Clark stoical II who says it's in no one's interest if the situation drags on Ecuador has been trying to find every solution possible to help Julian get out has been detrimental to his health it's been detrimental to the work that WikiLeaks does and and also you know I have to assume that it's not good for Ecuador's relations with the US the UK and even Sweden for this to continue on is only costly for the London Police Department's and is futile it's it there's no good reason so all of this seems very hypocritical it seems like they're kind of using it as as some kinda plume attic currency
