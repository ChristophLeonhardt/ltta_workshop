in his online comments Mandel notes how Levin suggests it is society that's at fault for overreacting to quote harmless fantasies apparently even the creation of stomach-churning kiddie porn is according to Levin a victimless crime at least in the eyes of this registered sex offender but here's the crux of the matter his parole conditions state he can't possess or access pornography or sexually explicit material in any form or type of media yet Levin is still reading and commenting on scholarly articles and pornography and pedophilia yeah I guess Levin's falling back on that old chestnut of you know I'm just here for research purposes and it's hard to believe what qualifies as works of academia these days in one posting Levin commended a researcher for an explicit story entitled quote school girls and soccer moms a Content analysis of free teen and MILF online pornography end quote he also commented on another paper entitled how common is men's self-reported sexual interest in prepubescent children indeed Levin actually lamented about society's quote current view that any person where the sexual interest in children must be a monster end quote yikes there's so much more so I urge you to read the Mendel call them online assuming you indeed have the stomach when it comes to delving into the full depravity of Levin's commentaries but in the aftermath of this expose two questions arise first given his parole conditions how is it that Levin's online activity isn't deemed to be a violation of those conditions a violation that would send Levin back to Jail where he so rightfully belongs secondly where is the proverbial media snowball regarding Levin's ongoing wrongdoing as far as I can tell this story is only being picked up by one other media outlet LifeSite news so here's the Toronto Star where's the CBC where are so many other apparent apologists for 11 who once championed this guy now this self-imposed radio silence is almost as disturbing as levin himself but maybe it shouldn't come as a real surprise considering toronto life article in 2015 noting that during his child porn trial dozens of lemon zest esteemed former colleagues wrote references for him including a former MLA the dean emeritus at the University of Manitoba and the director of professional programs at the University of Calgary they all spoke of Levin's brilliance and contribution to education policy and they grieved over his loss the loss of the voice in the field one supporter went to on to call him quote one of the three wise men of education that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
