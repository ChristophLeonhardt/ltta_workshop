Skopje, Macedonia
Protests and civil unrest erupt in the streets
of the small Balkan country.
The Macedonian government is accused of spying
on citizens.
The unrest grew after a police raid turned
into a deadly gun battle with ethnic Albanian
militants.
Many fear the events will reignite ethnic
tensions between the nation's Macedonian majority
and its Albanian minority.
In 2001, ethnic Albanian militants led an
armed uprising to fight for more political
rights.
Macedonia narrowly escaped a civil war, but
thousands were forced to flee their homes.
