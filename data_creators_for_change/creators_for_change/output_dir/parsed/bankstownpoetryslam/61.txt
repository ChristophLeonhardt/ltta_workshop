the biggest gang in the world is not the
blood or the Crips or any of that
listen they're wearing bulletproof vests
on their chest with a hero complex in
their head listen they don't need
designer threads to fulfill them just
their blue bodies and guns to glisten
listen they were in display their thug
status no but we sure as hell don't miss
them and lord help you if you dissin
listen we always stay listening the
silence is deafening but I I've had
enough of being silenced noose around my
brothers next to stay silent you have
the right to remain silent but we have
no rights to our silence black bodies
lying on the ground their silence brown
bodies duct tape for their silence why
the do we remain silent I mean a
white man walks there ain't a problem a
black man walks and suddenly there's a
conundrum black hoodie skittles Arizona
i see this combination equals lethal
weaponry can you see the discrepancy can
you see the discrepancy a whole
jury didn't see that zimmerman and
wilson shouldn't be free there is
nothing better than white people showing
supremacy I mean I me a way I mean
humanity and I know I research American
cases but Australian police are just as
racist a commissioned into Aboriginal
deaths in custody oh how gracious no
front-page news no rotation just silence
Malcolm Smith Lester Ross miss do Jaden
Vanel miss Mandie Jarrah Aboriginal
people stay dying in lockup unpaid fines
and on paper charges ruled as
unsuspicious how many people of color
must die before we realize that police
don't have discretion I mean we have
specific task forces like being specific
about an ethnicity will make them easier
to target so why is it called the Middle
Eastern Organised Crime Squad shouldn't
it be the Middle Eastern god damn you're
so fine squirt or the
or the Middle Eastern never running on
 times good and let me be
petty but shouldn't they also be a rich
white man invoke loose bashing their
wives squad or should it be called the I
can pay the police off type squad or way
the police might actually come to my
house when I call them type squad you
see the biggest gang in the world is not
the Bloods or the Crips or any of that
 listen they'll tell us they'll
protect us and uphold the law but if
your skin doesn't fit the wife what you
better watch your back so the
police coming straight from the
underground I'm tired of dying without a
sound I've had enough of being silenced
these colored bodies were never made for
the quiet
