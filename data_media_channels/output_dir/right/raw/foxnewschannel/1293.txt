00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:23,238
IN 2010, 2014, WHERE A LOT OF

55
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:23,906
YOUNG LEADERS WERE BORN AND

56
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:27,810

68
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:50,399
SIDES OF THE AISLE BECAUSE OF

69
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:56,338
THE TRUMP EFFECT ON THE

70
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:57,206
A LOT OF WOMEN ARE ALIENATED BY

73
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:06,115
WOMEN THINK IT IS THEIR TURN.

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,587
ACTIVISM TO ELECTORAL ENERGY.

79
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,924
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A

80
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:16,625
WOMAN AND HAVING THE WIND AT

81
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,292
YOUR BACK AND BEING A WOMAN

82
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:18,460

DEEPLY IN 2016, WE CAN'T GET

95
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:47,222
DISCOURAGED IS WHEN WOMEN RUN ON

96
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:50,592
MEDICARE FOR ALL, MAKING COLLEGE

97
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:51,260
DEBT-FREE, EXPANDING SOCIAL

98
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,299

99
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:57,900
INTERESTS OF OUR FAMILY.

100
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,634
>> THE BIGGEST THING WOMEN CAN

101
00:03:58,634 --> 00:03:59,334
LEARN FROM HILLARY CLINTON IS

102
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:01,236
RUNNING ON YOUR GENDER, WHICH

103
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:07,309

110
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:21,957
SIMPLY BEING A WOMAN IS NOT

111
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:22,624
ENOUGH AND SHE WILL BE HELD

112
00:04:22,624 --> 00:00:00,000
