Laura: DEMOCRATS HAVE LAUNCHED A BLITZ OF USING TRUMP TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND HOUSING THEM IN LITERALLY CONCENTRATION CAMPS ALONG THE BORDER. LEFTIST POLITICIANS FROM SENATORS TO HILLARY CLINTON TOOK THEIR BEST SHOT. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN MY MIND. I THINK IN THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF MANY AMERICAN THAT SOMEONE CAN JUSTIFY A POLICY OF DELIBERATE HARM TO CHILDREN AS A WAY TO GAIN LEGISLATIVE LEVERAGE. IN FACT WHAT HE'S DOING IS HOLDING THESE KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS HOSTAGE TO A WHOLE SET OF OTHER IMMIGRATION ISSUES. SEPARATING FAMILIES IS NOT MANDATED BY LAW AT ALL. THAT IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE. AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US, JOURNALISTS AND CITIZENS ALIKE, TO COLLEGES THAT. Laura: TO COLLEGES THAT. Laura: OKAY. WELL, SHE SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT LINE, RIGHT? WITH EMOTIONS RUNNING THIS HIGH, IS IT A P.R. BATTLE THE ADMINISTRATION CAN WON. LET'S DISCUSS ALL THIS WITH THE HEAD OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE PLEASED TO WELCOME ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS. FIRST TIME ON "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. THERE'S A LOT TO GET TO TONIGHT. YOU HEARD WHAT MRS. CLINTON SAID, THAT THIS IS A LIE. IT'S NOT CAUSED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DONE. THE PRESIDENT COULD PICK UP THE PHONE TONIGHT AND STOP THIS POLICY OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. WHAT'S THE REAL TRUTH THERE, GENERAL SESSIONS? I GUESS WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS THE PRESIDENT COULD JUST ISSUE A DIRECTIVE THAT EVERYBODY THAT ENTERS THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY BE RELEASED INTO THE COUNTRY AND NEVER BE APPREHENDED OR STOPPED OR PROSECUTED FOR THE ILLEGAL ENTRY. WE HAVE WATCHED WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OBAMA POLICIES, AND OVER THE YEARS, WE WENT FROM 15,000 ILLEGAL ENTRIES TO 75,000. THIS IS A HUGE LOOPHOLE IN OUR SYSTEM THAT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER PREVIOUS POLICIES, IF THEY WERE ENTERING THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY, NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. BUT WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THESE CHILDREN. THEY ARE NOT BEING ABUSED. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HOUSE THEM IN GOOD CONDITIONS. THEY WORK HARD AT IT. WE SPENT A BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DID, IN TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN WHO ENTERED THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY. LAURA, ONE MORE THING. CHILDREN STILL TEND TO BE THE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. WE HAVE HAD A BIG SURGE IN FAMILIES BRINGING CHILDREN OR SOME ADULTS BRINGING CHILDREN WITH THEM. Laura: ONE OF THE SHELTERS NOT TOO FAR FROM THE BORDER HAS 90% OF THE KIDS WHO ARE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. 10% WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. JUST SO MY VIEWERS UNDERSTAND THIS. GENERAL SESSIONS. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY UNIT, YOU SEE THEM ALL ON THE BRIDGES, WHICH I THINK IS ABSURD THAT THEY STAY ON THE BRIDGES NEAR THE PORTS OF ENTRY NURSE SAN DIEGO. NOW, WHEN THEY GET PROCESSED IN, IT IS SLOW. THEY GET PROCESSED IN AND IF A WOMAN SAYS THIS IS MY CHILD OR TWO CHILDREN, THEN WHAT HAPPENS? ARE THEY SEPARATED IF THEY CLAIM ASYLUM, SAYING I WANT TO CLAIM ASYLUM? WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOTHER OF THE CHILDREN AT THAT POINT? IF THEY ENTER THE COUNTRY AT A PORT OF ENTRY AND THERE ARE MANY OF THOSE ALONG THE BORDER, THEY ARE NOT VIOLATING THE LAW. THE MOTHER OR FATHER IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED IN THE FAMILIES ARE STAYING TOGETHER. PRESUMABLY THEY ARE CLAIMING ASYLUM AND THEY WOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED AND NOT BE SEPARATED. BUT IF THEY GO OUT IN THE DESERT, THEY CROSS A FENCE OR BARRIER, OUR OFFICERS HAVE TO IDENTIFY THEM. FOLLOW THEM, APPREHEND THEM. THEY ARE VIOLATING THE LAW AND THE NEED TO BE PROSECUTED FOR THAT. HE SIMPLY CANNOT CONDONE THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY. WANT TO END THIS PROCESS OF CHILDREN BEING BROUGHT ACROSS DANGEROUS TERRITORY, PLACING THOSE CHILDREN AT RISK. IF THEY WANT TO CLAIM ASYLUM FROM A LET THEM GO THROUGH THE THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE. Laura: YEAH, I THINK MOST PEOPLE AREN'T UNDERSTANDING THIS. I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT IF YOU COME, EVEN THROUGH ONE OF THE 25 PORTS OF ENTRY, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR FAMILY SEPARATED. THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S WORKING. IT'S A RARE CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN I THINK THE BORDER PATROL PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS PERSON IS NOT RELATED TO THIS OTHER PERSON THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT PRETTY QUICKLY IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS IS HOW YOUR OPPONENT, GENERAL SESSIONS, OUR DEMAGOGUE BEING THIS ISSUE. SIDING WHERE THE FAMILIES WERE SEPARATED, AND THAT'S WHY USE THAT PICTURE. LOOK, I KNOW WE ARE NOT NAZI GERMANY. ALL RIGHT? BUT THERE IS A COMMONALITY THERE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT ISN'T NAZI GERMANY, AND THAT'S A DIFFERENCE. WE DON'T TAKE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. UNTIL NOW. Laura: NAZI GERMANY, CONCENTRATION CAMPS, HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, LAURA BUSH HAS WEIGHED IN. MICHELLE OBAMA, ROSALYNN CARTER. YOU HAVE ALL OF THE FIRST LADY'S GOING BACK TO ELEANOR ROOSEVELT. SHE HAS APPARENTLY WEIGHED IN AS WELL. GENERAL SESSIONS, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? IT'S A REAL EXAGGERATION. IN NAZI GERMANY, THEY WERE KEEPING THE JEWS FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER. WE NEED TO THINK IT THROUGH, THE RATIONAL AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IT. WE WANT TO ALLOW ASYLUM FOR PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY FOR IT. PEOPLE WHO WANT ECONOMIC MIGRATION FOR THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL BENEFIT AND WHAT THEY THINK IS THEIR FAMILIES BENEFIT IS NOT A BASIS FOR A CLAIM OF ASYLUM. BUT THEY CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM. WE WILL PROCESS IT. AND I WILL REVIEW THE SITUATION AND MAKE A DECISION. THOSE CHILDREN, IF THE PARENT BRINGS THEM ACROSS THE BORDER IN AN UNLAWFUL AREA AND THE PARENT IS DEPORTED, THEY WILL TAKE THE CHILDREN HOME WITH THEM. THAT IS TRUE. IF THE PARENT CLAIMS ASYLUM AND IS ALLOWED TO STAY HERE, THAN THE CHILDREN STAY HERE ALSO. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TAKES CUSTODY. Laura: GENERAL SESSIONS, IS THIS POLICY IN PART USED AS A DETERRENT? ARE YOU TRYING TO DETER PEOPLE FROM BRINGING CHILDREN OR MINORS ACROSS THIS DANGEROUS JOURNEY? IS THAT PART OF WHAT THE SEPARATION IS ABOUT? SLICK OF FUNDAMENTALLY WE ARE ENFORCING THE LAW. IF YOU BREAK INTO THE COUNTRY Laura: IS IT A DETERRENT, SIR? ARE YOU CONSIDERING IT A DETERRENT? BECAUSE THE FACT THAT NO ONE WAS BEING PROSECUTED FOR THIS AS A FACTOR IN A FIVEFOLD INCREASE IN FOUR YEARS IN THIS KIND OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. SO YES HOPEFULLY PEOPLE GET THE MESSAGE AND COME THROUGH THE BORDER AT THE PORT OF ENTRY AND NOT BREAK ACROSS THE BORDER UNLAWFULLY. Laura: LET ME GET YOUR QUICK THOUGHTS, SIR, IF YOU WOULD ON THIS LOOMING CHILD WITH CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THOSE DOCUMENTS, AS YOU KNOW, FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT AND TREY GOWDY OVERSIGHT CHAIR SAID YESTERDAY OFFICIALS WILL BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS OF THE DOJ AND FBI DO NOT COMPLY WITH SUBPOENAS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? WELL, WE'VE GONE A LONG WAY IN DEALING WITH THAT. THE FBI'S WORKED HARD ON THAT I THINK. AN AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED WITH MR. TREY GOWDY AND MR. GOODLATTE. STAFFERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF OF JUSTICE AND FBI LOOKING AT THE RECORDS. I THINK THAT'S MOVING ALONG PRETTY WELL. Laura: THEY ARE OUT OF PATIENCE. GENERALIZATIONS GENERAL SESSIONS, I HATE TO INTERRUPT. SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTS END UP SHOWING UP IN THE IG REPORT CONGRESS' FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO. YOU WERE IN CONGRESS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TRY TO DO OVERSIGHT. IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING. THEY ARE HOLD ROSENSTEIN IN CONTEMPT. THEN WHAT? WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CONGRESS. WE INTEND TO BE RESPONSIVE TO CONGRESS. IF WE ARE RUNNING BEHIND IN PRODUCTION, WILL TAKE EFFORTS TO STEP IT UP. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PRODUCE THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE PROPERLY DISCLOSED BULL AND WE INTEND TO DO SO. THAT'S MY DIRECTION TO THE DEPARTMENT. SENATOR SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS, ONE MORE QUESTION. ARE YOU INVOLVED AT ALL IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A POSSIBLE RECUSAL OF ROD ROSENSTEIN OF MUELLER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT HE SIGNED UP FISA WARRANT. IT'S A BIG CONTROVERSY IN THIS CASE. I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THAT. HE IS THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THAT MATTER, AND HE HAS TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISION, AS I HAD TO MAKE MY DECISION.
