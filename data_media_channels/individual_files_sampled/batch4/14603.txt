the royal wedding with plenty of drama new embassies in Jerusalem and the fake news media they are some thirsty hoes all of that today on the rebel buzz once again we find that the media and liberals are more desperate for dirt than an empty ant farm they are thirstier than an Irish Catholic during Lent in a conversation surrounding how to eradicate the horror caused by international criminal gang in s13 which has been declared a terrorist organization and will likely be listed acept by the State Department President Trump said that these gang members are animals because they are at best some celebrities and news outlets that were undoubtedly watching it live and provided coverage of it went berserk but before I go through their comments let's just highlight a few of the crimes committed by ms-13 gang members in January of 2017 gang members filmed the torture stabbing and murder of a 15 year old girl in March of 2017 two ms-13 gang members were charged with kidnapping physical and sexual torture and murder of yet another teen girl in March of last year three ms-13 gang members were charged with murder of a 17 year old boy who had been mutilated by the gang members who stabbed him 16 times ran over him and cut off his hands so yeah they are at best animals but press secretary Sarah Stan Sarah Sanders thinks that the term animal is too generous which I tend to agree with in the White House press briefing Thursday morning she said this ms-13 has done heinous acts it took an animal to stab a man a hundred times and decapitate him and rip his heart out it took an animal to beat a woman they were sex trafficking with about 28 times I indenting part of her body and it took an animal to kidnap drugged and rape a 14 year old Houston girl that is what President Trump was talking about when he said animals you it is but let's look at some of the celebrity and media reactions that clueless caret Kathy Griffin tweeted this how the F isn't this a breaking news story the President of the United States calling immigrants animals he's acting like that's just the criminals but he really means all immigrants it's not breaking news Cathy because he was just talking about ms-13 gang members Conan O'Brien's sidekick Andy Richter calls the President dehumanizing bigoted monster and starlet aka twit Sophia Bush tweeted that ice is supporting people who've served multiple tours in the US military that literally has nothing to do with this conversation thirst queen since again we're talking about ms-13 not normal law-abiding immigrants try to keep up honey George Takei Takei whatever tweeted these aren't people these are animals Trump speaking in California about undocumented immigrants they just lie it's unbelievable their mouths open and a lie comes out do you people think that this helps reverse the loss of popularity that Hollywood has been experiencing the last two years because it doesn't you just look like egg on your face uninformed dishonest dholtze but they're not the only ones ABC News the New York Times NBC News The Associated Press CBS News CNN and even c-span all took the comments out of context reporting that the president was speaking about immigrants as a whole The Associated Press is the only outlet to issue a correction if you can even call it that they tweeted this ap has deleted a tweet from late wednesday on trump's animals comment about immigrants because it wasn't made clear that he was speaking after a comment about gang members so that's their version of a correction after a major mistake a flippant tweet a day later great job AP what do Guatemala Paraguay Czech Republic Romania Honduras Marshall Islands Micronesia Nauru Palau and Togo have in common if they are all places you visited props you congratulations world traveler but beyond that they have all expressed intent to follow president Trump and the United States lead in moving their embassies to Jerusalem the capital of Israel Guatemala was the first country to follow suit and have already relocated their embassy in a post by the president of Guatemala Jimmy Morales he announced that they would move the embassy on may 16th and said this I decided to return the embassy of Guatemala to the city of Jerusalem two days after the United States moved its embassy this is a sovereign decision and as a sovereign decision we recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel noting that Guatemala voiced their intent early on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a ceremony you were always among the first we remember our friends and Guatemala is our friend then and now so now how many more countries will likely follow suit and move their embassies I honestly just think that these countries needed a little bit of a nudge and maybe some diplomatic courage courtesy of our POTUS but in attendance at the ceremony for the US Embassy were top officials with the RNC four Republican senators ten Republican congressman one Republican governor treasury secretary Steve minuchin the president's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner among many others but notably absent no Democrats were present nine zero all right moving on to our final and fun topic of the week yeah it's the royal wedding tomorrow do you care who cares I don't care do you care but I guess a lot of people do care so I'm going to give you the lowdown on the marital throwdown first of all the wedding will take place at st. George's Chapel in Windsor the bride Meghan Markel is an American actress best known for her role on suits she's biracial and a divorcee which in normal circumstances I don't think that would really matter but this is the monarchy that forced Prince Edward the eighth to abdicate the throne after he fell in love with an American divorcee I think she was a divorcee a few times over also the monarchy that prevented Princess Margaret from marrying her divorcee man Peter Townsend I wonder what they would all think now anyway drama has plagued the bride as her family has spoken out against her character and the wedding itself I guess it's one of those yours mine and ours types of families with half siblings and step-siblings and all of that tangled web of familial confusion but her half-brother Thomas jr. called her phony and said she has been giving the performance of her life since she became famous he wrote a letter to Prince Harry that said this as more time passes to your royal wedding it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history Megan Markell is obviously not the right woman for you he also stressed that his half-sister is shallow and conceited and that Prince Harry still has time to back out whoops and her father who was initially slated to walk her down the aisle is recovering from heart surgery so he will not be doing that so it'll be interesting to see who gives her away at the ceremony and people are particularly enchanted by this wedding since it's a I don't know symbolic union of American and British heritage but President Trump as well as Barack and Michelle Obama were not invited British Prime Minister Theresa May also was not invited which scenes hella shady but perhaps the biggest invite shocker of all the Spice Girls were not invited oh my god but lots of people who were not invited will show up anyway and the area surrounding the chapel will look a lot like the infield at a NASCAR race anyway after the wedding day will become Duke and Duchess likely of Sussex I have heard but I guess that's yet to be determined and on a financial side note the two of them together are worth about thirty million dollars none of which belongs to the crown that is all there's 25 million of which is Harry's from inheritance and an annual allowance from Prince Charles and five million dollars of which are from is from Megan's TV revenue should we start placing bets on how long this marriage will last or how long before a Prince Philip's tile scandal happens I'll put 500 on two years or less everybody have a great weekend thanks for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.hsn download our app for the rebel media on the App Store that way you will have easy and instant access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
