1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,500
These tents represent the
first camp of its kind:

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,920
a temporary facility used
to house unaccompanied

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,460
migrant children between
the ages of 13 and 17.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,010
The tent camp
wasn’t always here.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,980
It was set up in June at this
facility, right on the U.S. side

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,900
of the border with Mexico.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,090
No reporters have been inside.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,090
A bipartisan group of mayors
who gathered at the facility

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,010
were also denied access.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,940
But by looking at
aerial imagery,

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,270
this is what we found out:

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,549
The small tent camp is
located within a port

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,200
of entry facility in Tornillo,
Tex., which opened in 2014.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,110
The facility is surrounded
by a barbed-wire fence.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,110
Beyond that are vast fields.

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,780
The small town of Tornillo
is four miles away.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,600
El Paso is 40 miles
to the northwest.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,950
It’s not the first
time migrants

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,240
have been housed here.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,190
A temporary holding
facility for families

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,990
was set up here in 
November 2016

22
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,990
as seen on 
these satellite images.

23
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,690
It was removed in April 2017.

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,780
New tents first appeared
on June 10 this year.

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,270
There are now 32 tents total.

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,870
One small tent holds 10
bunk beds — 18 of these tents

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,500
are set up here to house
up to 360 teenagers.

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,790
Temperatures can reach
over 100 degrees,

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,760
so the tents are
air-conditioned.

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,870
There are mobile bathrooms,
a food hall, a medical tent

31
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,030
and other support structures.

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,610
By June 20,
a soccer field was set up.

33
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,420
Otherwise, there’s not much
for the detainees to do.

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,000
It costs more than twice as
much to care for children

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,360
at temporary shelters
like the one in Tornillo

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,840
than at permanent shelters.

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,600
But these makeshift facilities
could become more common

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,760
if a zero tolerance
policy continues

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:00:00,000
to be enforced at the border.
