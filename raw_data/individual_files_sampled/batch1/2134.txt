unless you liked the way rubbing your head feels I mean there's no reason to really sit there and scrub and scrub and scrub the shampoo does its job does it quickly and just be on with it between 15 and 30 seconds is all you really need to do to cleanse your hair for conditioning for inches or longer would be perfect if your hair is very short it's not necessary at all it's actually the amount of product that you're putting in the hair cuz most people tend to overuse so you know guys just think more is better so they just pour it all in their hands and put it in the hair and it just takes longer to rinse longer to get out you can leave residue in the hair which is not good um so just you know the size of like a nickel or a dime usually with the way products are made these days are very concentrated and that's all you need to do once you start using too much of it you can leave residue in the hair which is going to make your hair not style as well not look as good and can actually look a little dirty
