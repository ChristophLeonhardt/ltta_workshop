to start this hour with breaking news from Turkey it's where the country's prime minister says Ankara will create a 30 kilometre buffer zone in Syria once its military operation against the Kurds is complete that's after he confirmed Turkish tanks have crossed into Syrian territory the Efrain operation has de facto been started on the ground the conflict began after the u.s. announced plans to create a new armed force with the Kurds close to the Turkish border Washington later said the announcement was made by mistake but it was not enough to stop the Turkish offensive as on Saturday Ankara launched airstrikes and began cross-border shelling however Kurds claim they have repelled the offensive so far at least ten people have been killed in the offensive mostly civilians according to the Kurds Ankara insists the only casualties have been Kurdish fighters and it's Army is taking all precautions to minimize civilian casualties artis Igarashi Deneuve has been assessing the situation and looking at what brought turkey back into Syria this is what the situation on the ground in Syria looks like right now Afrin the region where the Turks are carrying out their military operation the area highlighted in green is where the turkey backed rebels are to a certain extent at least they are helping Ankara from the ground red are the Syrian army these the Syrian army guys they don't have any problem with the Kurds but they do have a problem with these guys because this is the area the green area is also the region which harbors chaotic really sham or nusra a terrorist organization and finally here you have man bitch there it is also it as a city also controlled by the Kurds and it could be Turkey's game plan Aragon has already said that after he's done with our friend man bitch is next this operation hardly came out of the blue you know the Kurds have been historically a major thorn in Turkey's side but what catalyzed things now was the Pentagon saying they are going to create a so-called Syrian border force the Coalition is working jointly with the Syrian democratic forces to establish and train the new Syrian border security force currently there are approximately 230 individuals training in the BSF inaugural class with the goal of a final for size of approximately 30,000 one very precise description of America's intentions there by that point turkey had had enough anchor beefed up its forces on the Syrian border deployed tanks and President Erdogan vowed to destroy quote this terrorist force before Washington even has a chance to create it US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tried to do some damage control saying that the situation has been made sport raid was described and that some people misspoke well that wasn't nearly enough to contain turkeys fury Ankara has been keeping the United States in the loop about the operation against Washington's supposed ally America which arguably pitted turkey against the Kurds has now called on them to focus on the fight with ISIL pretty much the same as saying it's every man for himself in this conflict Turkey has also notified Syria about the action which Damascus is not happy about at all Russia in its turn has been cautious and called for all parties to pull the punches the main reason behind the developing crisis in this part of Syria is the provocative steps taken by the United States which were aimed at isolating areas with predominantly Kurdish populations uncontrolled deliveries by the Pentagon of modern weapons to pro-american formations in northern Syria contributed to the rapid escalation of tension in the region and led to a special operation by Turkish troops loose lips sink ships they say well this time we're looking at a potential all-out war Eagers done of RT turkey is a military action against the Kurds in Syria triggered protests across parts of Europe people took to the streets in a number of capitals to denounce the shelling and demand a de-escalation we discussed it turkeys move and what provoked it with various analysts previously the United States had told Turkey that they would not arm the YPG the Kurds and that they would leave Syria once Isis was destroyed now Isis has largely been destroyed least a territorial state they do not have to stay an arm and train a kurdish-dominated security force and that change in American foreign policy is what has really driven turkey to this taking a step there was a similar operation about half a year ago of turkey and turkey always indicated that it will not allow this the Kurdish forces to pose a threat to Turkey so I think the fact that the United States announced this special force was a trigger but it didn't really change the situation the turkey is determined that the Kurdish forces all along the northern Syria border will not be a threat it's amazing that the US has in the past week managed to completely betray both its rival allies in this in this conflict first the total betrayal of Turkey announcing this border security force made up primarily of Kurds without any consultation with Turkey and then as soon as turkey make make an issue of it immediately drop the Kurds all together and say oh we're nothing to do with them and basically give Turkey a free hand to slaughter them
