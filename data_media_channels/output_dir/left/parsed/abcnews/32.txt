>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
>>> GOOD DAY, I'M BYRON PITTS IN
NEW YORK.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 
APPEAR AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE'S EXPECTED TO SIGN A $1.3 
TRILLION SPENDING BILL THAT 
CONGRESS PASSED OVERNIGHT.
THIS IS AFTER ISSUING A SURPRISE
VETO THREAT ON TWITTER THIS 
MORNING.
HERE NOW IS THE PRESIDENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY.
WE HAVE A
LOT OF GOOD NEWS TO REPORT.
TREMENDOUS TRADE DEALS ARE BEING
MADE WITH VAERRIOUS COUNTRIES.
WE'RE NEGOTIATING VERY LONG, 
VERY HARD, BUT VERY QUICKLY.
AND THE DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA, 
ACCORDING TO SECRETARY ROSS AND 
BOB LIGHTHEISER IS VERY CLOSE TO
BEING FINISHED AND WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE A WONDERFUL DEAL WITH A 
WONDERFUL ALLY.
WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO IT.
IT WAS A DEAL THAT WAS CAUSING A
LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR OUR COUNTRY 
IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND IN 
TERMS OF LOTS OF OTHER THINGS.
I MIGHT ASK SECRETARY ROSS TO 
JUST SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THAT 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET ONTO
THIS RIDICULOUS SITUATION THAT 
TOOK PLACE OVER THE LAST WEEK.
SO, SECRETARY ROSS.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
WE BELIEVE WE ARE RELATIVELY 
CLOSE TO A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE 
RESOLUTION WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN
GOVERNMENT.
IT WOULD ENCOMPASS, IF IT GOES 
THROUGH, BOTH THE 232s AND 
BROADER TRADE ISSUES.
WE HOPE BY SOME TIME NEXT WEEK 
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A REAL 
ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THE LAST TIME WE NEGOTIATED 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND AS YOU 
KNOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM 
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEY 
CREATE A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS 
THAT NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO READ 
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST DONE.
YOU TELL ME WHO CAN READ THAT 
QUICKLY.
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO READ IT.
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, DEEP 
DEFENSE CUTS HAVE UNDERMINED OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S TAKEN OUT,
THEY'VE HALLOWED OUR READINESS 
AS A MILITARY UNIT AND PUT 
AMERICA AT REALLY GRAVE RISK.
MY HIGHEST DUTY IS TO KEEP 
AMERICA SAFE.
NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT.
THE OMNIBUS BILL REVERSES THIS 
DANGEROUS DEFENSE.
AS CRAZY AS IT'S BEEN, AS 
DIFFICULT AS IT'S BEEN, AS MUCH 
OPPOSITION TO THE MILITARY AS 
WE'VE HAD FROM THE DEMOCRATS AND
IT HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS, I TRIED 
TO EXPLAIN TO THEM, YOU KNOW, 
THE MILITARY IS FOR REPUBLICANS 
AND DEMOCRATS AND EVERYBODY 
ELSE.
IT'S FOR EVERYBODY.
BUT WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 
OPPOSITION TO CREATING REALLY 
WHAT WILL BE THE FAR -- BY FAR 
THE STRONGEST MILITARY THAT 
WE'VE EVER HAD.
WE'VE HAD THAT FROM THE 
DEMOCRATS.
SO IF WE TAKE SOMETHING FOR THE 
MILITARY, THEY WANT SOMETHING 
FOR, INN MANY CASES, THINGS THA 
ARE REALLY A WASTED SUM OF 
MONEY.
IT'S NOT RIGHT AND IT'S VERY BAD
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
WE'RE LOOKING TO DO FUNDING FOR 
OUR FINAL FIGHT IN CERTAIN 
AREAS.
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOTTEN JUST 
ABOUT 100% OF OUR LAND BACK FROM
ISIS.
WE HAVE TROOP INCREASES 
NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE 
HAVE TO DO, AND WE HAVE VERY 
IMPORTANTLY A PAY INCREASE FOR 
OUR TROOPS.
AND THIS WILL BE ACTUALLY THE 
LARGEST PAY INCREASE FOR OUR 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN OVERA  A 
DECADE.
IT INCREASES DEFENSE SPENDING BY
OVER $60 BILLION AND FUNDS 
SHIPS, PLANES, HELICOPTERS, 
TANKS AND SUBMARINES.
WE HAVE SUBMARINES BEING BUILT, 
THE LIKES OF WHICH THERE'S 
NOTHING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
LIKE THE SUBMARINES WE BUILD.
OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS THE 
BEST EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD, AND
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAW TWO 
DAYS AGO WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND 
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, SAUDI 
ARABIA AS AN EXAMPLE IS BUYING 
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
WORTH OF OUR EQUIPMENT.
WE'RE GETTING VERY FAST 
APPROVALS ON THAT.
THEREFORE, AS A MATTER OF 
NATIONAL SECURITY, I'VE SIGNED 
THIS OMNIBUS BUDGET BILL.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT 
I'M UNHAPPY ABOUT IN THIS BILL.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT 
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD IN THIS 
BILL, BUT WE WERE IN A SENSE 
FORCED IF WE WANTED TO BUILD OUR
MILITARY, WE WERE FORCED TO HAVE
IT.
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE 
SHOULD HAVE IN THE BILL.
BUT I SAY TO CONGRESS I WILL 
NEVER SIGN ANOTHER BILL LIKE 
THIS AGAIN.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.
NOBODY READ IT.
IT'S ONLY HOURS OLD.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW -- 
$1.3 TRILLION, IT'S THE SECOND 
LARGEST EVER.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED ONE THAT 
WAS ACTUALLY LARGER, WHICH I'M 
SURE HE WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH 
EITHER.
BUT IN THIS CASE, IT BECAME SO 
BIG BECAUSE WE NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF OUR MILITARY AND BECAUSE THE 
DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN 
THAT ADDED THINGS THAT THEY 
WANTED IN ORDER TO GET THEIR 
VOTES.
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE 
FILIBUSTER RULE.
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE 
FILIBUSTER RULE.
AND GO TO 51 VOTES IN THE 
SENATE.
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REALLY 
SUSTAINED, CONTINUED SUCCESS.
DACA RECIPIENTS HAVE BEEN 
TREATED EXTREMELY BADLY BY THE 
DEMOCRATS.
WE WANTED TO INCLUDE DACA.
WE WANTED TO HAVE THEM IN THIS 
BILL.
800,000 PEOPLE, AND ACTUALLY IT 
COULD EVEN BE MORE, AND WE 
WANTED TO INCLUDE DACA IN THIS 
BILL.
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD NOT DO IT.
THEY WOULD NOT DO IT.
TO PREVENT THE OMNIBUS SITUATION
FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN, I'M 
CALLING ON CONGRESS TO GIVE ME A
LINE ITEM VETO FOR ALL 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILLS, AND 
THE SENATE MUST END, THEY MUST 
END THE FILIBUSTER RULE AND GET 
DOWN TO WORK.
WE HAVE TO GET A LOT OF GREAT 
LEGISLATION APPROVED, AND 
WITHOUT THE FILIBUSTER RULE, IT 
WILL HAPPEN JUST LIKE MAGIC.
I WANT TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION 
ON BORDER SECURITY WHICH I CALL 
NATIONAL DEFENSE.
I CALL IT STOPPING DRUGS FROM 
POURING ACROSS OUR BORDER, AND I
CALL IT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
BUT NATIONAL DEFENSE IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT TWO WORDS BECAUSE BY 
HAVING A STRONG BORDER SYSTEM, 
INCLUDING A WALL, WE ARE IN A 
POSITION MILITARILY THAT IS VERY
ADVANTAGEOUS.
BEFORE I GET OFF OF THAT 
SUBJECT, I'D LIKE TO ASK 
SECRETARY MATTIS TO TALK ABOUT 
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN TERMS
OF THE MILITARY, BECAUSE THERE 
HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
WE'VE BEEN ABLE DO.
OUR MILITARY WAS VERY DEPLETED, 
BUT IT'S RAPIDLY GETTING BETTER 
AND IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT
WILL BE STRONGER THAN IT HAS 
EVER BEEN.
SO I'D LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY 
MATTIS TO SAY A FEW WORDS, 
PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN 1790 IN
GEORGE WASHINGTON'S FIRST ANNUAL
ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, HE STATED 
TO BE PREPARED FOR WAR IS ONE OF
THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF 
PRESERVING THE PEACE.
AS THE PRESIDENT NOTED, TODAY WE
RECEIVED THE LARGEST MILITARY 
BUDGET IN HISTORY, REVERSING 
MANY YEARS OF DECLINE AND 
UNPREDICTABLE FUNDING.
TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 
OUR MILITARY STRONGER THAN EVER.
WE IN THE MILITARY ARE HUMBLED 
AND GRATEFUL TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE -- 
>> WE'RE GOING TO STEP AWAY FOR 
A MOMENT AND BRING IN OUR CHIEF 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 
JONATHAN KARL.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS THUS 
FAR?
>> Reporter: THIS HAS BEEN AN 
EXTRAORDINARY 24-HOUR PERIOD, 
BYRON.
THE CONGRESS PASSED THIS BILL.
THE SENATE, FINAL PASSAGE OF 
THIS BILL WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT, 
ALMOST 1:00 IN THE MORNING THIS 
MORNING.
AND TOP WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS 
TOLD US MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT 
IT, THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO 
SIGN THIS BILL.
THEN WE HAD A VETO THREAT THIS 
MORNING AND NOW HERE HE IS 
APPARENTLY ABOUT TO SIGN THE 
BILL.
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF, REALLY BY 
ANY STANDARD A LOT BUT NOT BY 
THIS STANDARD BUT WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT GO A LONG WAY.
WE HAVE A LOT OF MONEY COMING TO
THE BORDER AND IT WILL BE COMING
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.
WE FUNDED THE INITIAL PAYMENT OF
$1.6 BILLION.
WE'RE GOING TO BE STARTING WORK 
LITERALLY ON MONDAY ON NOT ONLY 
SOME NEW WALL, NOT ENOUGH BUT 
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT VERY 
QUICKLY, BUT ALSO FIXING 
EXISTING WALLS AND EXISTING 
ACCEPTABLE FENCES.
THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT YOU 
HAVE TO SEE THROUGH.
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE 
THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE IN ORDER 
TO SEE WHAT'S COMING, AND IN 
MANY CASES IT'S NOT A PRETTY 
PICTURE WHEN YOU LOOK.
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE 
IT.
SO WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION FOR THE 
WALL.
THAT WILL START IMMEDIATELY.
THIS IS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING BUT
IT'S IMMEDIATE.
IT STARTS IMMEDIATELY, AND I'D 
LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY NIELSEN TO
SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT WE'VE
DONE IN TERMS OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY AND WHAT THE BILL DOES 
FOR HOMELAND SECURITY.
THANK YOU.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND WE
SUPPORT THIS OMNIBUS IN THE 
DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY.
AS THE PRESIDENT HAS STATED, 
UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP HE HAS 
DELIVERED FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE.
THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT ON A 
BORDER WALL SYSTEM.
THIS IS A 10% INCREASE FOR 
IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT.
THIS WILL HELP US IMPROVE OUR 
AVIATION SECURITY WITH SOME 
BADLY NEEDED UPGRADES, AND WE 
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH 
CONGRESS ON ADDITIONAL NEEDS 
THAT WE HAVE.
I WILL SAY, HOWEVER, THAT IT'S 
UNFORTUNATE THAT CONGRESS CHOSE 
NOT TO LISTEN TO THE MEN AND 
WOMEN OF DHS AND THOSE OR THE 
FRONT LINES.
THEY TOLD US HOW TO BUILD THE 
WALL, WHERE TO BUILD THE WALL 
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 
WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
WALL IS WHERE WE NEED IT, HOW WE
NEED IT AS THE PRESIDENT 
DESCRIBED, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT
IT SERVES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
AND SERVES THE SECURITY OF THIS 
NATION.
WE ALSO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 
WITH CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE 
DANGEROUS LOOPHOLES THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS MENTIONED MANY 
TIMES AND TO CONTINUE TO 
INCREASE OUR OVERALL SECURITY.
AND FINALLY, WE THINK THOSE IN 
CONGRESS WHO SUPPORT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,
I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE MYSELF 
AVAILABLE TO THEM.
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH 
THEM BUT WE MUST FUND THE 
DEPARTMENT AND GIVE IT THE TOOLS
AND RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO 
EXECUTE THE MISSION THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED US TO DO.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
SECRETARY.
SO WE HAVE MANY ELEMENTS IN THE 
BILL THAT WE WANTED.
JUST TO LOOK AT A FEW OF THEM, 
WE'RE PROVIDING $654.6 BILLION 
IN TOTAL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING 
FOR DEFENSE.
IT'S A RECORD.
ALL RECORDS FOR DEFENSE.
THERE WILL BE NOBODY THAT SAYS 
THAT OUR MILITARY IS GOING TO BE
DEPLETED LIKE THEY'VE BEEN 
SAYING OVER THE LAST LONG PERIOD
OF TIME, LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
FRANKLY, BEYOND PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING.
WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON
NUCLEAR -- OUR NUCLEAR SYSTEMS 
TO UPGRADE AND IN SOME CASES 
BRAND NEW, WHETHER IT'S 
SUBMARINES, NUCLEAR SUBMARINES 
AND OTHERS.
SO WE'LL HAVE BY FAR THE MOST 
POWERFUL NUCLEAR FORCE ON EARTH,
AND IT WILL BE ABSOLUTELY IN 
PERFECT SHAPE AND CONDITION, AND
HOPEFULLY, PRAISE BE TO GOD WE 
DON'T EVER HAVE TO USE IT.
BUT THERE WILL BE NOBODY THAT'S 
EVEN CLOSE.
THIS WILL GIVE A SUBSTANTIAL 
INCREASE TO PEOPLE EVEN OUTSIDE 
OF THE MILITARY BUT MILITARY 
RELATED.
SOME OF THE MANY THINGS THAT 
WE'RE BUYING IN THE MILITARY, WE
HAVE $23.8 BILLION TO PROCURE 34
NAVY SHIPS.
OUR NAVY IS AT ABOUT THE LOWEST 
POINT IN TERMS OF SHIPS THAT 
IT'S BEEN IN OVER 100 YEARS, AND
WE'RE ADDING A SIGNIFICANT 
NUMBER OF EXTREMELY ADVANCED 
VESSELS, $10.2 BILLION FOR 90 
F-35 AIRCRAFT.
THAT'S THE MOST SOPHISTICATED 
AIRCRAFT IN THE WORLD, JET 
FIGHTERS, TOTAL STEALTH.
THEY'RE HARD TO FIND.
THEY'RE HARD TO SEE.
THEREFORE, THEY'RE HARD TO BEAT.
IT'S VERY TOUGH TO BEAT A PLANE 
WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE IT.
IT'S THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE 
WORLD.
$10.2 BILLION FOR 90 F-35.
WE HAVE $2.9 BILLION FOR 15 
KC-46 TANKER AIRCRAFT.
TANKER AIRCRAFT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT BASED ON EVERYTHING.
IT ALLOWS OUR PLANES TO TRAVEL 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT 
LANDING.
$1.8 BILLION FOR 24 FA-18 EF 
SUPER HORNET AIRCRAFT FIGHTER 
JETS.
$1.7 BILLION FOR TEN PA 
POSEIDONS.
INCREDIBLE STUFF.
$1.1 BILLION FOR 56 UA-60 
BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS, MOST 
ADVANCED HELICOPTER IN THE WORLD
BY FAR, FIGHTING MACHINE.
$1.1 BILLION FOR THE UPGRADE OF 
85 ABRAMS TANKS.
$705 MILLION FOR THE COOPERATIVE
PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH
ISRAEL AND OTHERS ON VARIOUS 
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS.
WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON
MISSILE DEFENSE.
WE HAVE A LOT OF OFFENSE THAT'S 
BEEN RECENTLY INSTALLED.
WE'RE SPENDING TREMENDOUS MONEY 
ON MISSILE DEFENSE.
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS.
EVERYBODY DOES.
WITH WHAT WE HAVE OUT THERE, 
MISSILE DEFENSE IS VERY, VERY 
IMPORTANT.
WE ARE FUNDING OUR BORDER PATROL
AGENTS AND OUR I.C.E. AGENTS.
THEY ARE WORKING LONG HOURS 
UNDER TREMENDOUSLY DANGEROUS 
CONDITIONS.
WE'RE ADDING LARGE NUMBERS OF 
IMMIGRATION JUDGES, HIGH QUALITY
JUDGES.
NOT ONLY ARE WE ADDING THEM IN 
THE DISTRICT COURT LEVEL AND THE
FEDERAL LEVEL OF COURT OF 
APPEALS, BUT WE'RE ADDING 
IMMIGRATION JUDGES AT A VERY 
HIGH LEVEL.
SO WHILE WE'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN THE $1.3 TRILLION, NOBODY 
MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN ME 
BECAUSE THE NUMBER IS SO LARGE, 
IT WILL START COMING DOWN.
WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FUND OUR
MILITARY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE
BY FAR THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN
THE WORLD.
THIS WILL BE BY FAR THE 
STRONGEST MILITARY THAT WE'VE 
EVER HAD.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE 
PAGES, A LOT OF THAT IS DEVOTED,
A LOT, TO THE MILITARY.
I JUST WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS FOR WORKING SO HARD.
WHILE WE CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN 
SOME WAYS, WE HAVE TO ALSO KNOW 
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF STRINGS 
PULLING EVERYBODY IN DIFFERENT 
DIRECTIONS.
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS, THE 
REPUBLICAN CONGRESS MEN AND 
WOMEN HAVE BEEN STEADFAST ON 
THEIR FIGHT FOR THE BORDER AND 
STEADFAST FOR THEIR FIGHT ON THE
MILITARY.
WE'RE ALSO SPENDING $6 BILLION 
ON, AS YOU KNOW, VARIOUS FORMS 
OF DRUG CONTROL, HELPING PEOPLE 
THAT ARE ADDICTED.
IT'S A TERRIBLE PROBLEM, BUT 
THIS WILL BE ALSO A RECORD.
WE'LL BE SUING CERTAIN DRUG 
COMPANIES FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
WITH THE OPIOIDS, AND WE'LL BE 
BRINGING THE SUITS AT A FEDERAL 
LEVEL.
THE LEVEL OF DRUGS THAT ARE 
BEING PUT OUT THERE AND THE 
POWER OF THIS ADDICTION IS HARD 
TO BELIEVE.
PEOPLE GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A 
PERIOD OF A WEEK AND THEY COME 
OUT, THEY'RE DRUG ADDICTS.
THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY.
DOCTORS ARE WAY DOWN NOW IN 
THEIR ORDERS OF THE OPIOIDS, WAY
DOWN.
THAT'S A GREAT THING.
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR IN OUR 
RESEARCH FUNDS, WE'RE LOOKING 
FOR A MEDICINE THAT CAN STOP THE
PAIN WITHOUT THE ADDICTION SO 
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO 
BECOME ADDICTED TO THESE 
INCREDIBLE DRUGS.
SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE HAVE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE $6 BILLION 
IN HAVING TO DO WITH OPIOIDS AND
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT THIS COUNTRY
AND IN FACT THE WORLD IS HAVING 
WITH DRUGS.
SO WE'RE EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHEN IT 
COMES TO OUR MILITARY.
OUR MILITARY WILL BE FAR 
SUPERIOR THAN TO ANY MILITARY 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US.
YOU SEE THE PLAYERS OUT THERE.
YOU SEE WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.
WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT'S 
HAPPENED WITH OPIOIDS.
WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT'S 
HAPPENED WITH CERTAIN ELEMENTS 
OF THE BORDER.
NOT HAPPY WITH $1.6 BILLION BUT 
IT DOES START THE WALL AND WE 
WILL MAKE THAT $1.6 BILLION GO 
VERY, VERY FAR.
IT'S GOING TO GO VERY FAR.
I CAN TELL YOU THIS AND I SAY 
THIS TO DACA RECIPIENTS, THAT 
THE REPUBLICANS ARE WITH YOU.
THEY WANT TO GET YOUR SITUATION 
TAKEN CARE OF.
THE DEMOCRATS FOUGHT US.
THEY JUST FOUGHT EVERY SINGLE 
INCH OF THE WAY.
THEY DID NOT WANT DACA IN THIS 
BILL.
AND AS YOU KNOW, DACA IS ALSO 
TIED TO THE WALL FOR THE MAJOR 
FUNDING, THE $25 BILLION FOR THE
WALL AND OTHER THINGS.
SO I THINK THAT WILL BE COMING 
UP VERY SOON, BUT I DO WANT THE 
HISPANIC COMMUNITY TO KNOW AND 
DACA RECIPIENTS TO KNOW THAT 
REPUBLICANS ARE MUCH MORE ON 
YOUR SIDE THAN THE DEMOCRATS WHO
ARE USING YOU FOR THEIR OWN 
PURPOSES.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I JUST 
WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR 
BEING HERE.
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF MANY OF THE 
ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
GET.
WE'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IN 
ORDER TO FUND THE MILITARY WE 
HAD TO GIVE UP THINGS WHERE WE 
CONSIDER IN MANY CASES THEM TO 
BE BAD OR THEM TO BE A WASTE OF 
MONEY, BUT THAT'S THE WAY, 
UNFORTUNATELY, RIGHT NOW THE 
SYSTEM WORKS.
BUT WE HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE 
GREATEST MILITARY WE'VE EVER 
HAD, AND LOTS OF GOOD THINGS ARE
HAPPENING.
THE TRADE SITUATION WE'LL BE 
TALKING ABOUT NEXT WEEK.
WE HAVE MANY TRADE DEALS, NOT 
ONLY THE DEAL BEING MADE ON 
SOUTH KOREA WHICH LOOKS LIKE 
IT'S VERY CLOSE TO BEING 
FINALIZED, BUT MANY OTHER 
COUNTRIES ARE NOW NEGOTIATING 
FAIR TRADE DEALS WITH US.
SO WE'LL BE ROLLING THEM OUT AS 
YOU SEE THEM.
AND PART OF THE REASON, FRANKLY,
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT IS 
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE 
TARIFFS ON STEEL AND THE TARIFFS
ON ALUMINUM BECAUSE IT SHOWED 
HOW UNFAIR SOME OF THESE TRADE 
DEALS THAT HAVE BEEN IN 
EXISTENCE FOR MANY YEARS, HOW 
UNFAIR THEY'VE BEEN.
SO IT WILL BE GREAT FOR OUR 
COUNTRY, AND FRANKLY, IT WILL 
ALSO BE FREIGGREAT FOR OTHER 
COUNTRIES.
IT WILL BE FAIR AND IT WILL BE 
RECIPROCAL.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 
>> WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT IN ABOUT 
20 MINUTES AFTER YOU LOOK AT IT.
WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND
YOU'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
WE LOOKED AT A VETO.
I LOOKED VERY SERIOUSLY AT THE 
VETO.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT DOING IT 
VETO BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
INCREDIBLE GAINS THAT WE HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE FOR THE 
MILITARY, THAT OVERRODE ANY OF 
OUR THINKING.
>> HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT 
THE IMPACT OF THE TARIFF ON THE 
STOCK MARKET AND -- 
>> I THINK THE STOCK MARKET IS 
GOING TO BE GREAT.
THE STOCK MARKET'S WAY UP.
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE THE 
STOCK MARKET WAS FROM A 
DIFFERENT PLANET.
IT'S WAY UP.
CHINA IS GOING TO END UP 
TREATING US FAIRLY.
FOR MANY YEARS THEY HAD FREE 
REIGN.
THEY DON'T HAVE FREE REIGN 
ANYMORE.
WE'RE VERY FRIENDLY WITH CHINA.
WE HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH
CHINA.
LOOK, IT'S TIME.
IT'S TIME.
LAST YEAR WE LOST $500 BILLION 
ON TRADE WITH CHINA.
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
>>> JONATHAN KARL JOINS US 
AGAIN.
THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR HE WAS 
PLEASED ABOUT THE DEFENSE 
SPENDING, NOT HAPPY ABOUT BORDER
SECURITY AND HE PLACED THE BLAME
WITH DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS. 
>> Reporter: I HAVE TO SAY THAT 
IS THE STRANGEST BILL SIGNING IF
IT WAS A BILL SIGNING THAT I 
HAVE EVER SEEN COVERING THE 
WHITE HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT RAILED AGAINST THE
BILL, SAID THERE ARE MANY THINGS
IN THIS BILL, THIS MASSIVE 
SPENDING BILL THAT HE DOES NOT 
LIKE, THAT HE IS UNHAPPY WITH, 
AND THEN HE ALTERNATED AND 
PRAISED THE BILL AND THEN WENT 
OFF ON TANGENTS ABOUT TRADE 
DEALS.
IT WAS A VERY ODD BILL SIGNING.
THAT'S HOW IT WAS ADVERTISED ON 
THE WHITE HOUSE SCHEDULE, AS A 
BILL SIGNING.
ULTIMATELY HE SAID THAT HE 
SIGNED THIS OR I GUESS HE 
ALREADY SIGNED IT BECAUSE OF THE
MONEY THAT IS IN THERE FOR THE 
MILITARY, WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
IS CALLING THE LARGEST INCREASE 
IN MILITARY SPENDING.
SOMETIMES THEY SAY IT'S THE 
LARGEST IN 15 YEARS.
SOMETIMES THEY SAY IT'S THE 
LARGEST SINCE WORLD WAR II.
WE'LL SEE HOW THE NUMBERS SHAKE 
OUT.
IT IS A BIG INCREASE IN MILITARY
SPENDING.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE NUMBER ONE 
REASON WHY HE'S SO UPSET ABOUT 
BEING PUT IN THE POSITION OF 
HAVING TO SIGN THIS BILL IS THAT
THERE IS VIRTUALLY NOTHING IN 
THERE FOR HIS BORDER WALL.
HE MENTIONED $1.6 BILLION.
THAT'S $1.6 BILLION FOR BORDER 
SECURITY, BUT BYRON, THERE'S 
ONLY MONEY IN THIS BILL FOR 33 
MILES OF NEW WALL, 33 MILES ON A
BORDER THAT IS MORE THAN 2,000 
MILES LONG.
IT IS FAR SHORT OF WHAT HE 
WANTED.
THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT.
THAT'S WHY HE CAME SO CLOSE TO 
DECIDING -- SO CLOSE TO, HE 
SAYS, CONSIDERING VETOING THIS 
BILL. 
>> JONATHAN, DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN, TRUMP PROMISED $25 
BILLION, I THINK, RIGHT, FOR 
BORDER SECURITY?
THIS IS FAR SHORT OF THAT. 
>> Reporter: $25 BILLION IS THE 
NUMBER THEY HAVE PUT OUT TO 
CONSTRUCT THE WALL.
AT TIMES THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 
THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DELIVER
IT UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE, BUT NO MATTER HOW YOU 
SLICE IT, $1.6 BILLION IS FAR 
SHORT.
REMEMBER, AGAIN, THE $1.6 
BILLION HE'S GETTING IS NOT ALL 
FOR WALL CONSTRUCTION.
IT'S FOR BORDER SECURITY.
SOME OF THAT IS SECURITY THAT 
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WALL 
AT ALL.
SOME OF IT IS IMPROVING EXISTING
FENCING ON THE BORDER, AND ONLY 
33 MILES OF NEW WALL INCLUDED IN
THAT NUMBER.
>> JONATHAN, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH.
I'M SURE WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
TODAY.
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN NOW TO 
REGULAR PROGRAMMING.
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT NOW
ONLINE.
IT WILL BE A FULL WRAP-UP ON 
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" WITH DAVID 
MUIR.
