my name is Joan O'Brien and I'm here today to join the people's vote it's really important that we have a massive turnout for the people's vote you need a second vote on Europe because the first boat didn't go the way we wanted I'm going to be speaking to the remaining matter what they voted before isn't what they're getting so the people that voted lead would trick did not know what to brexit members and we're beginning to see the consequences of what the deal means yeah well we don't even know what a deal means I believe this is right the more time goes on the more convinced I am that is open the people already voted not everyone was allowed to vote or bias the results incredibly close to trick the public to make their grandchildren disgusting it wasn't really debated or discussed like it is not the people's fault so although the people already had boats with the last vote it wouldn't vote the way they wanted so if they have another boat they think maybe people will vote the way they want them to this time when the people have already voted I mean I can get our ducks against practicing bollocks is from the bank of Boris Johnson as worth 350 million who is going to just leave his country bereft and poor and a vassal state of good old Donald Trump I promise not to pay to the NHS the some of its democracy voting again yes of course it is everybody else who voted leave is essentially thick or racist or Islamophobic or xenophobic and that's a fact bollocks to brexit
