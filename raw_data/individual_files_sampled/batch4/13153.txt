with all of the said if these arguments are plausible why do you think it is that they're increasingly unpopular levels of religious activity are going down in the West levels of religious belief are going down and the West is it just that people have never dealt with these arguments or they decide that they're not interested in hearing the arguments because it's more fun to be atheist than not to be atheist why is atheism gaining is it it's a little bit of both I would say speaking for the perspective of an academic philosopher a major part of the problem is the hyper specialization of modern academic life we just know so much about so many different things that you could spend your whole life for example just doing molecular biology and never read anything in any other discipline and you still will not have plumb the depths of that little that one field no it's not a little field but that one field molecular biology right that's true even in philosophy itself and in different academic disciplines they've all got their sub disciplines and you could spend your whole life just studying this sub disciplines now what follows from that is that you have fewer and fewer generalists in modern academic life in other words people who try to look at the big picture if you're talking about an Aristotle or to go back you know far fewer centuries a Descartes or even to go back a hundred years 150 years the average philosophers scientists in those days for most of the history of Western thought up until about a century or so ago could literally be a know-it-all you could still master all the different bodies of knowledge and you can know a lot about philosophy and a lot about physics a lot about biology and all the rest much harder to do that now so part of the problem is that you get people outside of philosophy but also even people within philosophy who simply don't know a whole lot about the kind of arguments that I talked about in the book they may know nothing more than whatever cliches were trotted out in their introduction of philosophy class when they were a freshman or a soft sophomore and they heard some of the canned objections that were aimed at caricatures of Aquinas or Aristotle and Leibniz and then they never looked back they and then they repeated their own students when they teach an introduction a philosophy class say so part of the problem is just that it's lack of knowledge on the part of your average intellectual or your average academic because modern intellectual life has become so specialized and fragmented it's hard to know enough about the issue unfortunately ego prevents people from refraining for talking about things they don't know about so you'll have someone like a Richard Dawkins for example who's undeniably a brilliant man a very good writer and so forth he knows a lot about biology unfortunately he knows very little about philosophy and even less about theology but for some reason that doesn't keep him from pontificating on those subjects right so he trots out the stock objections that he might have heard when he was an undergraduate and he doesn't bother to sort of do the research and so forth and so what happens is when someone with that degree of prominence repeats the same tiresome and tired objections then that gives them new life because people think will Richard Dawkins he's a smart guy's an Oxford professor he must know what he's talking about not necessarily but that gives a whole other generation of young people students and so forth the same erroneous ideas about the arguments and so they get perpetuated that way that's another part of the part of the reason
