THE CITY'S REGULATOR AGREED AND

00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:08,205
GRANTED A PROBATIONARY LICENSE.

4
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:16,280
U.S. SUPPORTS NATO.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,980
CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CORKE HAS

6
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,649
MORE ON THAT FROM THE

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,922
MUCH SMALLER GDP.

8
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:32,396
SHOULD PAY THE SAME AS GERMANY.

9
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:33,997
>> TO THE DENIZENS OF THE

10

PALMETTO STATE IT WAS MUSIC TO

THE EARS.

12
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:38,502
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING TOUGH

13
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:39,336
ABOUT NATO, CALLING OUT GERMANY

14
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:42,372
FOR WHAT HE SAYS IS ITS LACK OF

15
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:43,307
FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO THE

16
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:44,174
ALLIANCE AND SUGGESTING NOW

17
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:45,909
MAYBE THE TIME FOR THE U.S. TO

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,679
PULL THE PURSE STRINGS.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,379
>> IT'S ALL WONDERFUL AND WE

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,215
LIKE TO HELP OUT, BUT IT HELPS

21
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:51,648
THEM.

22
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,851
THEY ARE IN EUROPE.

23
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:55,118
>> THE PRESIDENT'S CRITIQUE THAT

24
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:58,255
NEW.

25
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:00,257
HE SLAMMED THE ALLIANCE ON

26
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:01,258
TWITTER, WARNING THAT CHANGE IS

27
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,330
MINISTERS IN BRUSSELS AND

28
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:12,769
>> MORE AND MORE ALLIES ARE AT

29
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,872
2% OF GDP FOR DEFENSE.

30
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:16,740
BUT THEY ALSO AGREE THAT WE HAVE

31
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,608
TO DO MORE.

32
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,409
>> NATO HAS 29 MEMBER STATES BUT

33
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,143
ONLY EIGHT COUNTRIES, INCLUDING

34
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:24,381
THE U.S., SPEND THE AGREED TO 2%

35
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:31,688
BUDGET.

36
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,924
PARTNERS LIKE GERMANY FALL WELL

37
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:34,491
SHORT OF ADOPTING THE

38
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:36,393
PRESIDENT'S THREAT TO MATCH

39
00:01:36,394 --> 00:01:37,594
THEIR SPENDING LEVELS.

40
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:38,462
A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION

41
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:39,630
OFFICIALS SAY THE PRESIDENT'S

42
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:40,864
RHETORICAL PRESSURE ISN'T LIKELY

43
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:43,200
TO BE BACKED UP WITH IMMEDIATE

44
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:44,501
POLICY CHANGES, BUT THE RISK FOR

45
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:47,638
THE ALLIANCE IS ALL TOO REAL.

46
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,805
PARTICULARLY FOR EUROPEAN

47
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:49,640
CAPITALS TO WATCH WARILY AS

48
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:56,847
>> IN 2018 WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE

49
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,615
FINISHED WE WILL HAVE THE

50
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,350
LARGEST INCREASE IN DEFENSE

51
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,585
SPENDING BY OUR NATO COUNTRIES

52
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,420
OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES

53
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,856
SINCE THE COLD WAR.

54
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:06,556
>> THE RHETORICAL PRESSURE BY

55
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,592
THE PRESIDENT IS SEEN IN SOME BY

56
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,860
A PROXY ISSUE FOR WHAT HE

57
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:11,628
CONSIDERS UNFAIR EUROPEAN PARADE

58
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:12,462
DOWN MY TRADE PRACTICES,

SOMETHING WHICH WILL GET A GREAT
