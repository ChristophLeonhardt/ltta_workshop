00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,200
different and they say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not weakness</font>

situations where we could easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

81
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,790
stay small stay out of the way and I

82
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,190
never being not participating that's

83
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,010

107
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,949
representation of a lot of the guys to

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,380
either or i'm just to have this purpose

109
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,759

quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> or house would you be it's the</font>

120
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,530

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,490
you'd rather

127
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">but only to care about the house couple</font>

128
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,940
um but that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does it</font>

129
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,800
invites you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yes how would you</font>

130
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,510
experience this view if your face

131
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,090
minutes and that's what all

132
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,520
professionals<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gabriella us often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

133
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,520
the race sexuality etc of your character

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,860
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it described yes sometimes it plays</font>

135
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,870
in porter on the narrative how do you

136
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,340
decide to leave up the reader's

137
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,270
imagination well this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really</font>

138
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,699
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had this very</font>

139
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,080
conversation with myself it was

140
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,419
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me in the night from never</font>

141
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,540
letting go that everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel welcome</font>

142
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,000
and so I purposely didn't purposely well

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,110
there's two reasons for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> purposely</font>

144
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,910
left everyone I'm described as because I

145
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,840
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to be able to imagine</font>

146
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,470
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> from there but also Todd would</font>

147
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,820
describe that was my role<font color="#CCCCCC"> we I've tied</font>

148
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,870
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> book would never say anything</font>

149
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk was insane and I thought okay</font>

150
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,270
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to make sure everyone</font>

151
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,789
but it had interestingly had<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

152
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,800
the opposite effect and they soon

153
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,139
because I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain way that there</font>

154
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,150
for every character also looks that way

155
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,370
see but that's not what I wanted and so

156
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,360
in two I made a point to describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

157
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,580
few characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to say no no I'm</font>

158
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,190
aware I've seen a world lolz and even

159
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,870
though I'm only describing some of it I

160
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,880
do see this world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not it's not a</font>

161
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,410
single kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile writing so just</font>

162
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,610
enough to make everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel welcome and</font>

163
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,840
of course when it's important it's

164
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,180
important and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can pretend</font>

165
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,770
that it's not important sometimes for

166
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,150
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason some batteries it's</font>

167
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,450
important so um it depends I mean yeah I

168
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to ride oh I never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

169
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,170
write a lesson if you're saying that

170
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,610
you're writing the truth about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

171
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,980
and you're not reflecting what the worm

172
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,480
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like and that's also</font>

173
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,270
about and so that's kind of my approach

174
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try sometimes you get right sometimes</font>

175
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,830
you get wrong put a few bad yeah and you

176
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,030
can tell my reaction of readers and

177
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,680
early readers and what the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

178
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,910
if you're paying attention to a store

179
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,830
it's gonna have exactly the way people

180
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,750
in it you just got to be open-minded

181
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,590
enough to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole world I think</font>

182
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">social tracking the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question before</font>

183
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,560
we get on to some would you rather 'he's

184
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,570
allows that year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some like nice</font>

185
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,120
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> its mike says do you feel a sense</font>

186
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,220
of responsibility in brighton yaa

187
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,050
especially if you've grown<font color="#E5E5E5"> hilarity ah</font>

188
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,030
boy<font color="#E5E5E5"> investor this arrived I'm these are</font>

189
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">all from young readers yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

190
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,090
they're often teen readers kind of

191
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,080
readers are right for and it's

192
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,440
interesting because um I get these

193
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,020
questions from adults

194
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,129
when they come from sort of much much

195
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,840
older readers they tend to have a kind

196
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> conservative feel to them</font>

197
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,139
responsibility role model exactly the

198
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,110
way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on and I bet when they come</font>

199
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,270
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual readers so it's clear</font>

200
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually tend to come from the</font>

201
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,449
other side a little bit you know and I

202
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:09,770
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's okay i</font>

203
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,849
think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's how it should be</font>

204
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,220
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of responsible one way or the</font>

205
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,870
other absolutely but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

206
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,630
might think is it's so I feel a

207
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,340
responsibility to tell the truth as best

208
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,520
I can that's it I don't feel a

209
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,550
responsibility to teach preach or preach

210
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,708
one where they are all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause</font>

211
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,110
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just death to astoria its death</font>

212
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,070
part but I do for responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

213
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,289
the truth as I see it because I think

214
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the process is reversed i think you know</font>

215
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mole person I care about things</font>

216
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,980
things are important to me I believe

217
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,930
things really really strongly so

218
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore a story that I'm excited to</font>

219
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,170
tell I have to trust has all of those

220
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,270
things in it so all the all these

221
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,190
questions are diversity it's simply not

222
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,839
i don't believe in much emily<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

223
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,149
diverse yeah justjust their family

224
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">members and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to trust that I'm</font>

225
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,490
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attracted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stories contain</font>

226
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,610
what I care about in the end cut our if

227
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,050
you're listening to what you really want

228
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,660
to write it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be there so my</font>

229
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,339
feel my responsibility tell the truth

230
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,340
about that i'm d'lai

231
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,630
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the teen books when I was</font>

232
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,180
growing up they're all very very lessons

233
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,880
lessons sermons and hate event so I want

234
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell the truth about as far so that</font>

235
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">when too much info it's good I believed</font>

236
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,790
is on the line but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if I'm paying</font>

237
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,290
attention to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the truth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

238
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,470
going to every cortical lesson that I

239
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,970
want but it's not going to be a less

240
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">exposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it's good future so</font>

241
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,450
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little reverse process start with</font>

242
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,800
the storage you will get unless you

243
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
never never stop the list or yellow

244
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,440
stones no just be<font color="#CCCCCC"> invested and nobody</font>

245
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
went straight to us and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to</font>

246
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,370
write us I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell a story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if I</font>

247
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,190
tell the best story that I can one that

248
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,930
I care a lot of the most true as

249
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,040
possible way everything about you is

250
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,560
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good ok now we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font>

251
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,480
bookish would you rather switch there's

one comes from William Phillips very on

254
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,830
topic would you rather be a protagonist

255
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,960
in a book for secondary character it

256
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,610
depends on the book secondary characters

257
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,170
I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really lower secondary</font>

258
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">variants I mean my favorite character in</font>

259
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,210
all chaos walking is worth so I didn't

260
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">love the people who serve set aside some</font>

261
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,560
problems they get that reduce my poor

<font color="#CCCCCC">guess I'm sorry for denouncing it wrong</font>

268
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,080
and would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather be forced to only</font>

269
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">read one genre the rest of your life or</font>

at once they're getting everything about

272
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,460
the particular reading as soon as you

273
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,940
pick up and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> another is wrong where</font>

274
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,890
are those two choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say the</font>

275
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:13,140
genre one as I was like pick the genre

276
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,520
exactly how I devil I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
