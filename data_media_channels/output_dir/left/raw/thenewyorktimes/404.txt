1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,470
I started fencing when I was 9
at the Peter Westbrook Foundation.

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,789
And my mom brought my sister 
and I to the program

3
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,419
because she heard that they were 
producing all these black Olympians.

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,460
To be a representation for, you know, 
people like young black girls

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,980
who look like me and can see this as
an option. To see someone that

6
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,020
looks like them like medal or something
I think is powerful.

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,860
My name is Peter Westbrook.
I'm a six-time Olympian,

8
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,310
bronze medalist for the United States 
and the executive director of

9
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,920
the Peter Westbrook Foundation.

10
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,690
We have black children, white children, 
Asian children. We have so much diversity.

11
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:18,500
And our premier goal is to uplift and 
encourage one another.

12
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,300
Very difficult thing to do when you 
have your Olympic goals,

13
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,339
your Olympic dreams, world champion, 
national champion.

14
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,860
Very difficult to put those goals aside 
and uplift everyone else.

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,050
And that's what we do.

16
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,200
I think that being at the
Peter Westbrook Foundation

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,349
you learn camaraderie, you learn family, 
you learn to achieve at a high level.

18
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,599
And I think that the really powerful 
thing is you have beginners,

19
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,798
you have people who are the-up-and 
comers, you have elite people,

20
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:56,600
you have former champions and you have
these kind of people who are just really

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:00:00,000
passionate about the sport altogether 
kind of working towards one goal.
