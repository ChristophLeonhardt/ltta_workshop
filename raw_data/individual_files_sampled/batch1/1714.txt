I'm Adrian Finnegan this is al-jazeera live from Doha with more on the breaking news out of France on the the hostage situation in the south of the country French media are saying that police have shot dead the man who took hostages at a supermarket in the south west of France three people are reported to have been killed in three separate incidents around the town of Tab two of them died in the supermarket we're being told the hostage taker reportedly claimed allegiance to ISIL france's President and Prime Minister both say that this was an act of terrorism Emmanuel macron the president addressed the media in Brussels a short time ago here's what he had to say to pop the cork it's a G only field unit activist everything leads us to believe that indeed it's a terror attack the police intervened in a very coordinated manner after what was first an attack against officers please allow me to express my utmost support between the police officers responding live tout of Paris and Al Jazeera's Paul Brennan who can bring us up to speed with with the latest it appears that after a standoff lasting some hours Paul this has been brought to a rather dramatic end it certainly appears that way obviously the incident has evolved significantly from the three hours that we've been on air reporting it from around midday local time here to three o'clock as it is now what we're now being told is that there has been a police operation to bring the standoff at that super supermarket down into ed to an end we were told before the assault took place that there was just the gunman and a police officer as a sit as the single hostage remaining inside that supermarket that everybody else as far as they were aware had either been evacuated or escaped the police now we know decided to launch an assault to bring that to an end we're being told that the hostage taker the gunman has been killed and that's been confirmed now by the interior ministry that despite the Jean de Maria the local Jean de Marie who said that they were endeavouring at least to try to take him alive obviously for the purposes of questioning and putting him on trial for for what he'd done and the other thing that we know a lot more about now is the evolution of this incident through the morning as it first appeared there were fears that there were two separate attacks connected but separate attacks taking place in two closeby towns a place called Carcassonne and the supermarket in Webb what we now realize is there are actually three separate incidents but conducted by the same gunmen that's certainly the picture that's emerging what we know now is that there was a carjacking just before 10 o'clock this morning a white opal containing at least two people was carjacked we believe by the gunman who has now been shot dead the driver of that car was seriously grievously wounded and the passenger in that car was shot dead the gunman then took that white opal car and drove to a place where he was waiting for for CRS officers these are officers of the French riot police who were doing a jog they were they were out running presumably as part of some kind of fitness regime that they undertake he shot at those officers and as he was shooting at those officers he claimed to be a soldier of - and that was were the first indications that this was really a terrorist attack became it started to solidify among those four officers that were shot at one was injured wounded in the shoulder then the gunman it now appears quite clearly drove that car a short distance eight kilometers down the road it's a straight road between Carcassonne and the town at Reve he then got to a trap and went into the supermarket to super ooh at that supermarket two more people were shot dead and he took a hostage of a police officer so what we're talking about now is three people at least three people that we know of dead and two wounded plus now we're being told from the local area the death of the gunman himself
