THAT'S HOW MY WRITING CAREER

23
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:52,919
BEGAN WITH TURTLES.

24
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,455
I-- I LIVED IN BAYO, NEW JERSEY,

25
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,090
IN A FEDERAL HOUSING PROJECT.

26
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:57,957

WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE

31
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:03,496
CATS.

32
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,630
SO THE ONLY PETS I WAS ALLOWED

33
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:08,334
TO HAVE WERE TURTLES, LITTLE

34
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:09,869
DIME-STORE TURTLES THAT WE

35
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,238
BOUGHT AT WOOLWORTH'S, AND THE

36
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,006
LITTLE ROUND BOWLS WITH THE PALM

37
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,606

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,307
>> Stephen: ON THE LITTLE

39
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:15,741
ISLAND WITH THE WATER AROUND IT?

40
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,043
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

41
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:17,577
>> Stephen: SURE.

42
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,945
>> I HAD A TOY CASTLE.

43
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,714
I COULD FIT TWO TURTLE BOWLS IN

44
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,249
THE TOY CASTLE.

45
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:25,952
SO I HAD A NUMBER OF TURTLES.

46
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,453
BUT THE THING IS ABOUT THOSE

47
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,155
LITTLE DIME-STORE TURTLES, THEY

48
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:29,856
DIE VERY SOON.

49
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,390
I FED THEM THE TURTLE FOOD, AND

50
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,593
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING EVERYTHING

51
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:34,594
RIGHT AND, YOU KNOW, IN A FEW

52
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,428
MONTHS THEY'D BE DEAD.

53
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,996
AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY

54
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:37,830
THEY WERE DYING.

55
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:40,066
BUT IT CERTAINLY WASN'T MY FAULT

56
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,167
SO I DECIDED --

57
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,868
>> Stephen: WAS IT MURDER?

58
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,836
>> THAT THEY WERE COMPETING FOR

59
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:44,770
THE TURTLE THRONE.

60
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:47,039
THEY WERE KILLING EACH OTHER TO

61
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,474
DETERMINE WHO --

00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,513
>> THE TURTLE KING, YES, IN THE

00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,113
CASTLE.

66
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,882
THAT WAS MY FIRST FANTASY,

67
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,383
TURTLE CASTLE.

68
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,886
IT PRECEDED "GAME OF THRONES" BY

69
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,553
MANY YEARS.

70
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,088
>> Stephen: CAN'T WAIT FOR IT.

71
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,356

YOU FOR THIS, TOO.

77
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:16,202
YOU CENTER A NEW BOOK, FIRE &

79
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,938

82
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,376
TURTLES YOU WERE WRITING THE

84
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,246

FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION

86
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:29,782
HEROES?

87
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:30,850
WHO INFLUENCED YOU WHEN YOU WERE

88
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:31,884
READING AS A KID?

89
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:35,021
BECAUSE I READ A TON WHEN I WAS

90
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,022
A KID.

91
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:40,059
>> I READ "HAVE SPACE WILL

00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:40,726
TRAVEL."

93
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,093

94
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,395

ALSO VERY GOOD.

98
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,037
IN FANTASY, I STARTED OFF CAN

I THINK RIFSEDDING THEM --

102
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,112
>> Stephen: DID THEY HAVE SEXY

103
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,747
LADIES ON THE FRONT?

104
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,919
>> DEFINITELY, FRESETA SIT AGO

00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:11,891
CLAD DANCING GIRL.

109
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:15,895
AND THEN I ENCOUNTERED TOKEN WHO

110
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:16,996
PUZZLED ME FIRST BECAUSE IT WAS

111
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:18,030
LIKE THE BIRTHDAY PARTY --

112
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,498
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

113
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:22,034
THE FELLOWSHIP OF RING BEGINS

114
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,135
WITH A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

115
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,338

116
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:25,972
PARTY.

117
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,073

119
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,543
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW WHO

120
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:31,711
IS HAVING SEX WITH WHO.

121
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,813
NEW ELVES COME FROM SOMEPLACE,

122
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,314
BUT YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW

123
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,015
THEY DO IT.

124
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,718
>> AT FIRST I WASN'T SURE ABOUT

125
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,088
TOKEN, BUT BY THE TIME I I GOT

126
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:47,493
TO RIFFEN DALE AND THE LOVERS, I

127
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,728
THOUGHT THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK

128
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:52,331
EVER WRITTEN.

129
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:53,733
>> Stephen: THE GUY WHO FIRST

130
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,502
GAVE ME MY COPY OF "LORD OF THE

131
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,371
RINGS," A GUY NAMED KEITH

132
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,905
SARGEY, ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS

133
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:01,974
IN THE WORLD, HE SENT ME YOUR

134
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,976
BOOKS AND SAID, "I FOUND IT."

135
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:04,677
BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS LOOKING

136
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,445
FOR THE NEXT THING TO OBSESS.

137
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:07,146
IN OUR LIVES.

138
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,748
WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

139
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,982
THAT COULD STAND UP TO THAT KIND

140
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,550
OF LOVE THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE A

141
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,084
FANTASY WORLD.

142
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,186
AND YOUR BOOKS ARE IT.

143
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,721
WHAT-- WHAT-- WHAT LED TO YOU

144
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,823
WRITE THIS, WHICH TAKES PLACE

145
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,426
300 YEARS BEFORE THE EVENTS OF

146
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,127
"GAME OF THRONES"?

147
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,361
>> YES, BEFORE WE CAME UP WITH A

148
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:23,929
TITLE FOR THIS, WE WERE CALLING

149
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:29,602
IT G.R.G.SPRKS DEGRILL YILION.

150
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,537

151
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,171
DEEP SOURCE MATERIAL.

152
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:34,106
>> THIS IS NOT A TRADITIONAL

153
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,007
NOVEL.

154
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,377
IT'S A IMAGINARY HISTORY.

155
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,812
IT'S WRITTEN FROM THE VIEWPOINT

156
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,249
OF ARCH MAICER AT THE CITADEL,

157
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,684
IS AND TRYING TO GO BACK AND

158
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,385
MAKE SENSE OF THE EARLY HISTORY

159
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,521
OF TARGARYEN KINGS --

160
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,455
>> Stephen: IS THIS LIKE THE

161
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,324
MAD KING AND THE FALL OF THE

162
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,025
TARGARYEN FAMILY?

163
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,292
>> THAT WILL BE THE SECOND HALF.

164
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,761
I HAVE TO WRITE A SECOND ONE.

165
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:56,996
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE FIRST

166
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:57,430
HALF!

167
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,799
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

168
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,035
THIS IS 700 PAGE LONG.

169
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,971
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

170
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:07,506
>> THERE WERE A LOT OF KINGS!

171
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,141
THERE WERE A LOT OF KINGS!

172
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,077
>> Stephen: DOES THIS GO BACK

173
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,545
TO VOLARIA?

174
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,581
>> IT STARTS WITH AGON THE

175
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:16,949
CONQUEROR AND HIS TWO SISTERS,

176
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,485
AND IT GOES UP TO THE REGENCY OF

177
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:22,121
THE BOY KING AGON III.

178
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,856
THERE ARE LOTS OF DRAGONS AND

179
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,858
BATTLES AND BETRAYALS AND --

180
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:26,926
>> Stephen: AREN'T YOU

181
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,260

00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:31,664
TIME?

184
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,632
NOT TO ADD TO THE CHORUS OF WHAT

185
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:35,668
HAS TAKEN SO LONG.

186
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:40,973
BUT THIS IS A 700-PAGE DETOUR.

187
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,476
