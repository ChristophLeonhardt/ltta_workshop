1
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,940
I want safety for my kids.
I mean that's why my son's here

2
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,044
today it's because we're
educating him that you know

3
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,047
you never pick up a firearm
and you never point it at

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,017
anybody unless you know what
you're going to do with it.

5
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,121
The Second Amendment crowd
you know we as Americans,

6
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,957
we as free Americans

00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,361
our feelings via
the ballot box.

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,657
You came through for me,
and I am going to

9
00:01:30,690 --> 00:00:00,000
come through for you.
