IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES

21
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:56,869
REASON TO QUESTION THE NONSTOP

00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,269
HEIGHT.

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,305

31
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,053
ONLY THOSE DEVELOPERS WERE

00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:33,572
FOR THE HAMILTON TICKET OR DID

43
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:35,107

NOW WHETHER HIS BROTHER GAVE HIM

71
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:32,131
A TICKET OR NOT, HE KNEW THE

72
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:32,932
SOURCE OF THE TICKET.

73
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:36,101
WE SUPPOSE A DEVELOPER WHO

74
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:37,303
NEEDED HIS HELP.

75
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:40,205
THIS IS WHY THE STATE OF FLORIDA

76
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:41,907
ETHICS COMMISSION INVESTIGATED

77
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:42,741
GALEN.

78
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,944
THE PROBE REMAINS OPEN AND THE

79
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,946
DEMOCRATS FLORIDA STAR SEEMS TO

80
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:47,346
BE FALLING.

81
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,748
TONIGHT AT HIS SECOND AND LAST

82
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:51,150
DEBATE AGAINST DISANTO'S, GILLAM

83
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:54,753
WAS PRESSED ON THE ISSUE AND

84
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:55,821
THINGS GOT HOT.

85
00:02:55,822 --> 00:03:02,928
>> HE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE HE'S

86
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:03,996
NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION.

87
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:08,233
>> I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT

88
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:11,370
HAVING ASKED MORE QUESTIONS.

89
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:12,771
I'M RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR AND IN

90
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:17,810
THE STATE OF FLORIDA WE GOT A

91
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:18,344
LOT OF ISSUES.

92
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:20,112
>> NICE TRY, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

93
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:22,614
HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM WHERE IT

94
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:23,182
HAPPENS.

95
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,650
I SUGGEST THAT GILLAM MOVES TO

96
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:25,784
SAN FRANCISCO WHERE HIS VIEWS

97
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:29,288
AND HIS STYLE OF POLITICS WOULD

98
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:30,189
FIT PERFECTLY.

99
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,824
NOW LET'S MOVE ONTO THE

100
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:32,391
GOVERNOR'S RACE.

101
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,893
IN GEORGIA WHERE THIS VIDEO

102
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:37,029
FOOTAGE OF GUBERNATORIAL

103
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,064
CANDIDATE STACY ABRAMS SURFACE.

104
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,033
NOW IT SHOWS HER AND OTHERS ON

105
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,701
THE STEPS OF THE GEORGIA CAPITAL

106
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:44,036
EARNING THE STATE FLAG IN

107
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:44,370
PROTEST.

108
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:50,609
THAT WAS 1992.

109
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,377
ABRAM SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN HER FLAG

110
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:51,877
TORCHING THIS WAY.

111
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:53,779
>> 26 YEARS AGO AS A COLLEGE

112
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,747
FRESHMAN, I ALONG WITH MANY

113
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,715
OTHER GEORGIANS INCLUDING THE

114
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,684
GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA WERE DEEPLY

115
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,053
DISTURBED BY THE        RACIAL D

116
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:01,086
DISTURBED BY THE        RACIAL V

117
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:01,120
DISTURBED BY THE        RACIAL S

118
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:01,153
DISTURBED BY THE        RACIAL V

119
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:01,186
DISTURBED BY THE        RACIAL N

120
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:01,487
DISTURBED BY THE        RACIAL S

121
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:04,189
THAT WERE IN THAT STATE FLAG

122
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,290
WITH THE CONFEDERATE SYMBOL.

123
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,392
>> Laura: LET ME BE TRUE BUT

124
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:07,192
THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA AT THE

125
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,295
TIME DID NOT SET THE FLAG ON

126
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:11,697
FIRE ON THE CAPITOL STEPS.

127
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:12,898
HE WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE

128
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:16,135
TO AMEND THE FLAG, CHANGE IT AND

129
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,137
REMOVE THE CONFEDERATE SYMBOL

130
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:19,137
THAT PEOPLE FOUND OFFENSIVE.

131
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,939
SO DOES A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR

132
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,142
CONSIDER IT RIGHT TO SIMPLY

133
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:26,545
DESTROY PUBLIC IMAGES OR SYMBOLS

134
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,179
THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS FIND

135
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,746
OFFENSIVE?

136
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:30,749
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT THE

137
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,751
PEOPLE OF GEORGIA HAVE TO

138
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:33,152
ANSWER.

139
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:37,389
AND THEN, THERE IS SUPER BETO.

140
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,391
YES, SOME STREET ARTIST IS

141
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,360
TRYING TO DEPICT O'ROURKE, WHOSE

142
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,361
REAL NAME IS ROBERT FRANCIS, AS

143
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:44,830
SOME KIND OF SUPER HERO BUT HIS

144
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,198
ACTIONS BELIE THE DESIGNATION.

145
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,834
BACK IN 1998 WHEN THE TEXAS

146
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:50,803
SENATORIAL CANDIDATE WAS 26, HE

147
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,805
WAS DRINKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE

148
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,139
DRIVING AND HE STRUCK ANOTHER

149
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,875
CAR AND ATTEMPTED TO FLEE THE

150
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:57,242
ACCIDENT.

151
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:01,280
SINCE THEN, HE TRIED TO SOFT

152
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:07,753
PEDDLED THE DRIVING DRUNK, WHICH

153
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,823
I DID IT COME AS A TERRIBLE

154
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,526
MISTAKE FOR WHICH THERE IS NO

155
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:15,160
JUSTIFICATION OR EXCUSE.

156
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,895
>> Laura: YOU SHOULD ALSO NOT

157
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:17,763
TRY TO EXCUSE YOURSELF FROM

158
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:18,764
ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE THE SCENE OF

159
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:24,903
AN ACCIDENT, WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY

160
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:25,737
YOUR INTENTION.

161
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:27,973
NOW WHEN ARRESTING HIM IN, "THE

162
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,341
DRIVER ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE THE

163
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,376
ACCIDENT, BUT WAS STOPPED BY THE

164
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:33,745
WITNESS."

165
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:35,114
NICE TRY, SUPERMAN.

166
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:38,550
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED HIS

167
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:39,218
1995 BURGLARY CHARGES FOR

168
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,385
BREAKING INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF

169
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:43,889
TEXAS AT EL PASO, OR THIS

170
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:56,301
HEINOUS COMMERCIAL.

171
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:57,202
MUSICAL PHYSICAL >> Laura:

172
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,905
MORE LIKE LEADER OF THE HACK.

173
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,174
AS VOTERS HAD TO THE POLLS, IT

174
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,575
WOULD SERVE THEM WELL TO SEE

175
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:04,710
THROUGH THE LIBERAL MEDIA PIXIE

176
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:08,113
DUST ABOUT ALL OF THE SO-CALLED

177
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:08,714
DEMOCRATIC SUPERSTARS.

178
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:11,316
WHO THESE PEOPLE REALLY ARE,

179
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,317
CHECK IT OUT.

180
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:14,119
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT THEY

181
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,320
BELIEVE IN.

182
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:18,090
OPEN BORDERS, HIGHER TAXES,

183
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:19,758
GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE,

184
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,959
GUN-CONTROL, AND MORE

185
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,729
REGULATIONS ON BUSINESS.

186
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,666
ALSO REMEMBER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

187
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,067
STARS, WHO ARE ACTUALLY SEEING

188
00:06:29,068 --> 00:00:00,000
THE LIGHT REFLECTED FROM A STAR
