♪♪ AINSLEY: DESPITE HIS LONG LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA CONTINUES TO BASH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION. PETE: OF COURSE THEY DO. THE MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER TRACKS COVERAGE, CLOSELY THE MEDIA COVERAGE, REVEALS IN A NEW STUD DISHES 91% OF MAJOR BROADCAST COVERAGE OF THIS PRESIDENT IS NEGATIVE. DESPITE THE MEDIA'S HOSTILE REPORTING, THE PRESIDENT'S POLL NUMBERS, LOOK AT BOTTOM, CITING ANOTHER NEWS NETWORK, THEY ARE ACTUALLY CLIMBING. AINSLEY: IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEAN, IT SAYS HIS APPROVAL RATING GONE UP. DECEMBER IT WAS 37%. END OF APRIL IT WAS 43%. HERE TO WEIGH IN, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MOLLIE HEMINGWAY. GREAT TO BE HERE. AINSLEY: WHY IS APPROVAL RATING GOING UP SO DRASTICALLY? A FEW THINGS. WHEN EVERYTHING IS A PROBLEM, NOTHING IS A PROBLEM. THE MEDIA HAS BEEN SAYING HISTRIONIC HYSTERICAL THINGS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP SINCE HE WAS ELECTED, BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED. IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO TUNE OUT. THERE IS NO DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THINGS THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM AND THINGS EVERY ONE CAN TELL AREN'T. IT IS ALSO TRUE WHAT THE MEDIA AS THINK OF NEGATIVE CAN COME OFF VERY POSITIVE. SO WHEN THE MEDIA SAY, GOSH THIS GUY IS ABNORMAL, DOING THINGS THE WAY YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THEM, THEY PORTRAY IT AS VERY NEGATIVE THING. FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS SICK AND TIRED THE WAY WASHINGTON WAS DOING THINGS, LEARNING HE IS NOT CONVENTIONAL, HE IS ABNORMAL DOES NOT COME OFF AS NEGATIVE INTENDED BY MEDIA. PETE: DON'T YOU THINK THEY CAN SEE THROUGH IT. 40% OF THE NEGATIVE COVERAGE IS FOCUSED ON CONTROVERSIES WHILE 45% ON ACTUAL POLICIES. IF YOU CUT TAXES, REPEAL THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND MOVE EMBASSY, JOBLESSNESS AT ALL-TIME LOWS, TAKING ON THE IRAN DEAL, DOING THINGS YOU SHOULD WOULD YOU DO WHERE DOES ALL THE NEGATIVE COME FROM? PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN SCANDALS. IT IS OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING WITH A LOT OF MEDIA COVERAGE IS AN TREATMENT TO RELITIGATE THE 2016 ELECTION. THEY HOP FROM SCANDAL TO SCANDAL. THEY BREAK NEWS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MORAL FAILINGS, MOST PEOPLE WITH A PULSE HAVE KNOWN SINCE THE 80'S. THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER TO PEOPLE, LIKE IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY ARE NOT COVERED AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD BE. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN COVERED AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD BE FOR MANY YEARS. THE STRUGGLE OF THE ECONOMY THAT WASN'T WELL-TOLD DURING THE OBAMA YEARS. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DEEPLY-FELT BY PEOPLE. THERE IS DIFFERENCE WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT, WHAT THEY GET 24/7 ON MANY NETWORKS AND NEWSPAPERS. LOOK AT MELANIA'S APPROVAL RATINGS HAVE GONE UP DRASTICALLY SINCE JANUARY. JIMMY KIMMEL MAKING FUN OF HER. SHE SPEAKS FIVE LANGUAGES. SHE HANDLES HERSELF BEAUTIFULLY. SHE IS CLASSY, ABOVEBOARD. DO YOU THINK ALL THE NEGATIVE COVERAGE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY ACTUALLY HELP THEM AND THAT IS WHY THEIR APPROVAL RATING ARE GOING UP? WHEN PEOPLE SEE UNDULY HARSH COVERAGE OF A FIRST LADY, WHETHER MELANIA OR ANYBODY ELSE, THAT TENDS TO PROVOKE SYMPATHY. IT IS FASCINATING HOW LITTLE COVERAGE WE GET OF MELANIA, COMPARED TO PREVIOUS FIRST LADY, EVERY TIME THEY WORE A GOOD DRESS IT WAS MAJOR NEWS, MELANIA IS PUSHED TO THE SIDE BY A LOT OF MEDIA COVERAGE. PETE: PRESIDENT TWEETING ABOUT THE NEGATIVE COVERAGE, ASKING THE QUESTION, SHOULD WE REMOVE PRESS CREDENTIALS, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? OH, THE THING DONALD TRUMP OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD NOT WANT ANYTHING TO CHANGE WITH THE MEDIA COVERAGE. HE NEED AS FOIL AND GETS IT WITH THE NEGATIVE MEDIA COVERAGE. IT IS BAD FOR THE MEDIA THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE SO OPPOSITIONAL, IT MAKES PEOPLE TRUST THEM LESS.
