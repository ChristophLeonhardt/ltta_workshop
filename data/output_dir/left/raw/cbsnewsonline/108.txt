AUGUST 28th. 

1678

FIRST OF ALL, EXPLAIN WHY THE 

1679
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,549
PRESIDENT HAS PICKED A SIDE 

1680
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:44,920

YOU'RE SEEING PLAYING OUT IS 

1691
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,242
THE TRUMP EFFECT BEGINS TO 

1692
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,743
RESHAPE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

1693
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:11,046
YOU ALSO SEE HOW THE FOX NEWS

RESHAPING OF THE REPUBLICAN 

1696
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:13,548
PARTY AND IT'S PLAYING OUT 

1697
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:14,650
RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA. 

1698
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,787
THE OTHER CANDIDATE IN THE 

1699
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,090
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR 

1700
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,225
IS ADAM PUTNAM, VERY WELL 

1701
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:25,361
KNOWN, VERY WELL RESPECTED, 

1702
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,529
HEAVILY ENDORSED, WELL FUNDED, 

1703
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:31,267
WAS LEADING THIS RACE FOR A 

1704
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:37,072
GOOD LONG WHILE, CONSIDERED THE 

1705
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:45,346
HEIR A TO RICK -- HARE TO RICK 

1706
01:09:45,346 --> 01:09:45,580
SCOTT. 

1707
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,582
WE SAW DESANTIS SHOWING UP 

1708
01:09:47,582 --> 01:09:48,250
ALWAYS DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT. 

1709
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,885
THAT AFFINITY DEVELOPED BECAUSE 

1710
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,886
THE PRESIDENT LIKED WHAT HE 

1711
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:53,255
HEARD FROM RON DESANTIS AND 

1712
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:54,055
THEREFORE DECIDED TO WADE INTO 

1713
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:55,090
THIS PRIMARY. 

1714
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,062
EVEN THOUGH NOT ONLY HAVE MANY 

1715
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,964
FLORIDA REPUBLICANS BACKED OUT, 

1716
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,032
ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S CLOSEST 

1717
01:10:04,032 --> 01:10:09,538
POLITICAL ALLIES OF THIS STATE, 

1718
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,273
PAM BONDI, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

1719
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,707
HAS ALSO BACKED ADAM PUTNAM. 

1720
01:10:12,707 --> 01:10:13,709
SO THE PRESIDENT IS PUTTING 

1721
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,744
HIMSELF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF 

1722
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,444
A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. 

1723
01:10:16,444 --> 01:10:17,946
THE LAST DAY TO REGISTER TO 

1724
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:20,249
VOTE IN THAT PRIMARY IS THIS 

1725
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:20,616
COMING MONDAY. 

1726
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,117
SO THE PRESIDENT CAME DOWN HERE 

1727
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,954
NOT ONLY TO OFFER A SPEECH 

1728
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:26,454
ABOUT WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED AS 

1729
01:10:26,454 --> 01:10:29,091
PRESIDENT, BUT TO BORE IN ON 

1730
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:32,895
TIS REP PRIMARY AND PUT ALL OF 

1731
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,163
HIS WEIGHT BEHIND RON DESANTIS 

1732
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,564
MENTIONING HIM MANY, MANY TIMES 

1733
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,067
THROUGH THE COURSE OF HIS 

1734
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,837
REMARKS TRYING TO SEND AN ECHO 

1735
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:46,141
AFFECT ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. 

1736
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:47,276
BY ENDORSING DESANTIS A COUPLE 

1737
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,079
WEEKS AGO THE RACE HAS NOW 

1738
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:50,346
SHIFTED. 

1739
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,880
PUTNAM IS TRAILING NOW BY 

1740
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,682
DOUBLE DIGITS AND IS WONDERING 

1741
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,050
IF HE CAN BOUNCE BACK. 

1742
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,653
WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING 

1743
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:58,587
TO MAKE SURE ADAM PUTNAM 

1744
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,957
DOESN'T BOUNCE BACK AND THEN HE 

1745
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,459
RESHAPED THE FLORIDA REPUBLICAN 

1746
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,427
PARTY BY ELEVATING DESANTIS AND 

1747
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,896
MAKING HIM THE REPUBLICAN 

1748
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:08,163
NOMINEE. 

1749
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,832
>> LET'S TURN TO GOVERNOR RICK 

1750
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,867
SCOTT AND HIS SENATE CONTEST. 

1751
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:13,969
INTERESTINGLY GOVERNOR SCOTT IS 

1752
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,671
NOT THERE AT THE RALLY. 

1753
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:16,772
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT MIGHT 

1754
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:16,838
BE? 

1755
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,709
>> Reporter:  WELL, RICK SCOTT 

1756
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,579
WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS 

1757
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,114
MORNING FOCUSING ON THE 

1758
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:25,681
ALLIANCE HE HAS WITH THE 

1759
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,149
PRESIDENT ON POLICY, BUT I 

1760
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,318
DON'T THINK RICK SCOTT 

1761
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:33,388
CONSIDERS IT A GOOD IDEA TO 

1762
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:35,090
ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH THIS 

1763
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,292
INTRAPARTY SQUABBLE GOING ON, 

1764
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:39,528
THE ONE REALLY CREATED -- NOT 

1765
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,663
CREATED BY THE PRESIDENT 

1766
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,497
BECAUSE DESANTIS WAS RUNNING, 

1767
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,500
BUT MADE ALL THE MORE VISIBLE 

1768
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,968
BY THE PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT 

1769
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,604
OF DESANTIS AND HOW THAT 

1770
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:49,972
ENDORSEMENT REMADE THE RACE 

1771
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:50,372
ALMOST OVERNIGHT. 

1772
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,374
I THINK RICK SCOTT WOULD PREFER 

1773
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,076
TO KEEP SOMEWHAT A DISTANCE 

1774
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:57,146
FROM THE RACE TO SUCCEED HIM, 

1775
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,380
FOCUS ON HIS CAMPAIGN, FOCUS ON 

1776
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,049
WHAT HE DOES AND HAS DONE AS 

1777
01:12:01,049 --> 01:12:02,751
GOVERNOR TO WORK ALONGSIDE AND 

1778
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:05,054
WITH THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, BUT 

1779
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:08,190
NOT PUT HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE 

1780
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,191
OF THIS INTRAPARTY FEUD. 

1781
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,592
>> MAJOR, DURING THE RALLY DID 

1782
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,727
I HEAR CORRECTLY, DID THE 

1783
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:16,465
PRESIDENT SAY ATONE POINT THAT 

1784
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,300
YOU NEEDED AN ID TO BUY 

1785
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:18,600
GROCERIES? 

1786
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,769
I THINK THAT COMMENT HAD A LOT 

1787
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:21,670
OF FOLKS SCRATCHING THEIR 

1788
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,971
HEADS, BUT THE BROADER POINT 

1789
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:23,872
THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO 

1790
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,575
MAKE THERE WAS HE WAS CALLING 

1791
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:27,676
FOR VOTER ID. 

1792
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,378
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, VOTER ID 

1793
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,713
EXISTS THERE IN THE STATE OF 

1794
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:31,980
FLORIDA. 

1795
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,583
>> Reporter:  YES. 

1796
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,185
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS 

1797
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,187
WHERE THE PRESIDENT KNOWS IT'S 

1798
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:42,724
A POPULAR IDEA AND CONCEPT 100 

1799
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:47,329
CONSERVATIVE VOTERS AND HE'S 

1800
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:47,929
LESS -- CONCEPT WITH 

1801
01:12:47,929 --> 01:12:49,231
CONSERVATIVE VOTERS AND HE'S 

1802
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:51,500
LESS CONCERNED WITH DO YOU NEED 

1803
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,035
AN ID TO BUY GROCERIES OR IS 

1804
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,403
THAT ALREADY THE LAW IN 

1805
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:54,870
FLORIDA? 

1806
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,036
NO. 

1807
01:12:55,036 --> 01:13:00,075
IT'S ONE OF THOSE LARGER 

1808
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,977
CULTURAL TOUCHSTONE ISSUED AND 

1809
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:02,745
THE PRESIDENT SPRINKLED THOSE 

1810
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,646
THROUGH HIS REMARKS AND IF I 

1811
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,182
COULD, I'D WANT TO SAY 

1812
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:07,916
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RALLY. 

1813
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:11,954
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE 

1814
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,188
BEEN ON THE ROAD WITH THE 

1815
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,489
PRESIDENT AND I THINK THERE MAY 

1816
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:17,025
BE A TENDENCY TO SAY ALL THE 

1817
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,694
RALLIES ARE THE SAME AND IN 

1818
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:21,497
CERTAIN RESPECTS THEY ARE THE 

1819
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,499
SAME, BIG VENUE, BIG iPOD 

1820
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,000
SONGS, THE SAME SIGNS WITH 

1821
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,633
GENERALLY THE SAME ENTHUSIASM. 

1822
01:13:25,633 --> 01:13:27,736
YOU COULD BE LULLED INTO A 

1823
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:34,276
SENSE OF INTELLECTUAL OR 

1824
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,078
POLITICAL ANALYSIS COMPLACENCY 

1825
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,946
SAYING THESE RALLIES ARE ALL 

1826
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,816
THE SAME, KIND OF REPETITIVE, 

1827
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,251
NOT TRUE IN ONE IMPORTANT 

1828
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:42,784
RESPECT. 

1829
01:13:42,784 --> 01:13:44,453
VOTERS WHO ARE WITH TRUMP NOW 

1830
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:44,853
FEEL VINDICATED. 

1831
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:46,488
THEY FEEL AS IF THEY WERE 

1832
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:46,721
RIGHT. 

1833
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:48,757
THEY FEEL AS IF THEY ARE 

1834
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,527
REAPING THE BENEFITS OF THE 

1835
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:55,731
POLITICAL CHOICE THEY MADE IN 

1836
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,199
2016 AND I DETECT AT LEAST AT 

1837
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,803
THIS RALLY NOT ONLY A SENSE OF 

1838
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:01,937
THAT VINDICATION, BUT IF 

1839
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,272
POSSIBLE, A DEEPER SENSE OF 

1840
01:14:04,272 --> 01:14:08,410
ATTACHMENT TO THIS MOVEMENT, 

1841
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,077
THIS CAUSE, THIS POLITICAL 

1842
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,846
CONSTRUCT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS 

1843
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:15,517
PLACED BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN 

1844
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:16,785
PARTY AND NOT INCIDENTALLY 

1845
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:17,218
BEFORE THE COUNTRY. 

1846
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,887
úSO I THINK 

1847
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,422
THERE IS A SECOND STAGE TO THE 

1848
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,424
TRUMP PHENOMENON AND IT'S 

1849
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:23,659
PLAYING OUT AMONG TRUMP 

1850
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:24,826
SUPPORTERS. 

1851
01:14:24,826 --> 01:14:25,727
ITS EFFECT ON THE 

1852
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,830
DESANTIS/PUTNAM RACE IN FLORIDA 

1853
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,297
IS ALREADY VISIBLE. 

1854
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,431
THE VERY IMPORTANT TEST -- AND 

1855
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:31,200
WE HAVE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND 

1856
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,903
ABOUT HOW THIS TEST WILL PLAY 

1857
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,072
OUT IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS -- 

1858
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,909
IS CAN THAT EFFECT HAVE ANY 

1859
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,778
RESONANCE OUTSIDE A REPUBLICAN 

1860
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:43,178
PRIMARY CONTEST? 

1861
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,212
CAN IT TRANSLATE IN 

1862
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:46,481
CONGRESSIONAL AND SENATE RACES 

1863
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:47,782
IN A MIDTERM ELECTION? 

1864
01:14:47,782 --> 01:14:51,787
AND IF IT DOES, THEN YOU HAVE A 

1865
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,221
GENUINELY CYCLE TO CYCLE 

1866
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:55,290
POLITICAL PHENOMENON GOING ON. 

1867
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,825
I'M NOT PREDICTING THAT, BUT 

1868
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,327
FOR LOTS OF UNDERSTANDABLE AND 

1869
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,129
QUITE OBVIOUS REASONS BASED ON 

1870
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,365
WHAT WE SAW IN 2016 I'M 

1871
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:04,633
CAUTIOUS ABOUT SUGGESTING IT 

1872
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:05,166
CAN'T HAPPEN. 

1873
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,802
>> MAJOR GARRETT, ALWAYS 

1874
01:15:07,802 --> 01:15:11,440

OBSERVATIONS, INSIGHT AND 

1876
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:13,041
ANALYSIS.
