00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
hello YouTube<font color="#CCCCCC"> jaza here so let's talk</font>

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what's happened in the past week</font>

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,690
or so on this channel shall we in case

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,870
you've somehow missed this i did a video

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,210
saying why i would potentially be voting

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,219
for each of the major parties that I as

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,100
an English person can vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> for on the</font>

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">7th of May in the UK general election I</font>

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,600
started with you Kip because I had to

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,400
start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Kip I had to start with</font>

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,130
something controversial that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,000
making people think what resulted was

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,660
something that I probably should have

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected a little bit more in that I</font>

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,690
lost 200 subscribers and 200 regular

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,000
viewers<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is about about ten percent</font>

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,930
of my regular viewership to the fact

18
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,690
that this video came across as me

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,989
endorsing UK now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

20
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,030
those videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the policies that I</font>

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,590
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all things that I</font>

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,960
passionately feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> are important stuff</font>

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,610
that needs to be considered when we go

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,079
to the ballot box on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7th of may</font>

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,180
therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to ignore things in</font>

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,670
certain parties that i think on helpful

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">or things that i disagree with the</font>

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,990
reason I did this was because I want to

29
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you guys reasons to vote I don't</font>

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,400
want to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys a reason to be</font>

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,470
fearful of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this party or be fearful of</font>

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,939
that candidate one of the biggest

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,830
problems with the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this country</font>

34
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,590
at the moment is the fact that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,880
series of little echo chambers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,290
have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people agreeing with each</font>

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,210
other and that does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> help democracy I</font>

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,680
think one of the greatest things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,240
saw in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past five years is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,610
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been held together by a</font>

41
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,350
coalition government that has been built

42
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,820
on compromise and although you may have

43
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,100
not expected it to last five years and

44
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">for it to do the stuff that has done it</font>

45
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,360
seen two political parties that had

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,009
differing views and differing manifestos

47
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,070
come together and find<font color="#E5E5E5"> common ground and</font>

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,280
I think that only through doing that we

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,579
are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go forward as a country and</font>

50
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,770
be less divisive what I want to be the

51
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,479
takeaway from this series of videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

52
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,240
i did is the fact that through

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
engagement you can change things look at

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,959
what's happening in<font color="#CCCCCC"> scotland after the</font>

55
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,470
referendum where they said no but

56
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,330
now have a hugely engaged electorate

57
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,700
we're gonna see a Scotland noun that's

58
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,290
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ninety percent of</font>

59
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,220
its seats change hands they are taking

60
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,930
power they are changing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

61
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,510
democracy and I think that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

62
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,000
we do things and not by doing what

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,010
Russell Brand wants us to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

64
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,110
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing civic action</font>

65
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,010
so he advocates protesting and lobbying

66
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,870
people right but not voting because we

67
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,190
haven't been given something to vote for

68
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,520
I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you guys something to</font>

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,940
vote for whether it's UK or the Greens

70
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,520
all the lib dems or greens or labor or

71
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,770
SMP applied Camille the DUP or champagne

72
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,810
right your voice is worth hearing but in

73
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,390
order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your voice heard you have</font>

74
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,430
to engage find out who your local

75
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,380
candidates are find out what they stand

76
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,260
for and if at the end of the day none of

77
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people who are standing in your</font>

78
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">constituency represent your views you</font>

79
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,500
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another option and that is spoiling</font>

80
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,440
your ballot it's better to turn out and

81
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,530
to draw a penis on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ballot paper then</font>

82
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,080
to just be a forgotten citizen who

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,800
doesn't engage you have power we've been

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,040
given power this isn't something that

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,300
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> just been given to us by the gods</font>

86
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,750
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> earn the vote and the fact that</font>

87
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,760
so few people are using it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third</font>

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,860
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the UK didn't vote in 2010</font>

89
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,830
I find that horrifying and scary and

90
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,250
depressing

91
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,940
your voice is worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing I I honestly</font>

92
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,320
don't know who I'm going to vote fall in

93
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,090
the seventh of may yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only have six</font>

94
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,390
days left but i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be going to the</font>

95
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,520
polling station and i will be due in

96
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,220
gauging in whatever way I see fit on

97
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,790
that day I hope you do the same as well

98
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,090
and i hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in at least one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

99
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">videos you've engaged with somebody who</font>

100
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,980
had a different view to you because it's

101
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,370
for compromise and it's through

102
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,310
engagement that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able</font>

103
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,450
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this country a better place and</font>

104
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,870
i genuinely believe that so that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

105
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say on the matter I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> born</font>

106
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,690
with oranges I'm in a park in Hackney

107
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,690
totally

108
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,280
look at Scotland what's happening there

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
after the referendum they have a hugely

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,600
engaged electorate there's a dog coming

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,310
and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards me hello mate oh</font>

112
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:05,130
hello hello haha she on you oh yeah oh

114
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spin and say that that dog</font>

115
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,120
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to engage with the</font>

116
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation and want to do engage with</font>

117
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,830
politics if that dog wants to engage

118
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,700
shut so should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear it's a stretch I</font>

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:00:00,000
know
