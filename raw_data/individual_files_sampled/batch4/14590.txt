hey folks be careful with your pronouns no not when addressing people but rather when referring to animals you know of all the isms out there racism sexism ableism ageism the one ISM that's getting more traction these days is speciesism now by definition speciesism is all about the exploitation of animals under the pretense of human ego centrism ie the idea that humans are intrinsically superior to animals but wait a second we are superior to animals aren't we I mean granted there are notable exceptions Big Sleep and group in shit that's a filthy animal I need nothing ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces have a dog dog eats his own feasible only doggy filthy animal I wouldn't go so far as to call him dog filthy but they're definitely dirty but dogs got personality personality go the wrong way so by that rationale if a pig had a better personality he ceased to be a filthy animal is that true well we have to be talking about one charming mother fucking pig I mean he had to be 10 times more charming than that on the long green ankles you northern planner yeah show me a real-life pig that knows how to work a television set and I'll buy into that whole specie ISM argument chapter and verse granted it goes without saying that no reasonable person would ever choose to carry out unnecessary acts of cruelty against another living creature animal husbandry after all is all about being respectful toward animals especially when it comes to the slaughtering process but because this is 2017 the animal rights movement like so many other special interest groups just can't resist taking a sharp left turn into the twilight zone I speak of a recent lecture at Binghampton University on speciesism delivered by hen and the Guin and the Guin is with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA as we know it and she focused on so-called animal oppression by humans and as an example of such oppression the Guin lamented that so many people referred to an animal using the pronoun it as opposed to he or she seriously now for starters one must wonder of Nguyen has any idea what sort of minefield she just waded into given the oh so complicated issue of pronouns on campus these days after all in our baskin-robbins world of 31 gender pronouns he and she don't cut it any more which is why we're told to employ such gender-neutral pronouns as here see Z and V hey old Bessie chewing your cud out in the field might look like a dairy cow but what if she's currently identifying as a bucking bronco but I digress so while PETA obsesses over the correct pronouns we need to employ when addressing Fido and fluffy I ponder just what is the next step in the animal rights movement as it continues its descent into the depths of insanity well one of the biggest hobby horses on campus these days is so-called cultural appropriation in other words if you're Caucasian you are forbidden from using the various inventions and practices that were developed by non-caucasian races unless that includes everything from yoga and boomerangs to hoop earrings so I must say I was shocked shocked I tell you to witness Jane Goodall the primate expert and United Nations messenger apiece culturally appropriate in the language of another species oh it's true it's true check it out my wonderful welcome comes to you from the forests and hills of Gumby National Park in Tanzania the sound that you would hear if you came some of you have been but if you go to Gumby and climb the hills in the morning the sound of a chimpanzee greeting the day announcing Here I am no comment folks but I say it's high time we put an end to this appropriation of chimp chatter and primate prattling surely appropriating such language amounts to a combination of speciesism and cultural appropriation and we can't have that and by the way Lady Jane isn't the only humanoid appropriating monkey-talk yes I speak of one of the biggest hits to emerge from the Rick Dees catalog of yester decade namely dis gorilla you know when we speak of the Titans of rock-and-roll we tend to focus on the Beatles the Rolling Stones Led Zeppelin why oh why do we so often forget to mention the musical genius that is Rick Dees at any event enough with the species appropriation already primate lives matter after all for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks we have a new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
