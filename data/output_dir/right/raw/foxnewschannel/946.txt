2
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:02,029

THE REMAINS OF THESE GREAT

00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:06,100
FALLEN HEROES, CAN WE DO

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,467
SOMETHING?

6
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,269
HE AGREED TO IT IMMEDIATELY.

00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:15,109
FOR THEIR LOVED ONES TO BE

12
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:18,112
RETURNED FROM THE KOREAN WAR.

13
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:20,815
MORE THAN 7700 AMERICAN TROOPS

14
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:23,884
ARE STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.

15
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:25,686
MY NEXT TWO GUESTS HAVE BEEN

16
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:26,420
FIGHTING FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES

17
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,156
FOR THE RETURN OF THEIR FAMILY

18
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:29,490
MEMBERS.

19
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,692
FIRST LIEUTENANT ROBERT SCHMIDT

20
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,128
PUSHED THROUGH INJURIES TO FIGHT

21
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:34,862
IN ONE OF THE BLOODIEST BATTLES

22
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:37,164
OF THE KOREAN WAR AND WAS KILLED

23
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:37,531
IN ACTION.

24
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:40,768
JOHN HENRY ZIMMERLI IS AN

ON A MISSION IN KOREA IN 1952 IN

00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,010
HIS PLANE WITH FOUR OTHERS AND

28
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,878
NEVER RETURNED.

29
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,747
JOAN MORRIS IS THE NIECE OF

30
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:55,049
FIRST ROBERT SCHMIDT, WHO SHE

31
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:00,187
KNOWS AS UNCLE BOBBY AND THE SON

32
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:02,323
OF JOHN HENRY ZIMMERLI.

33
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:03,090
THANK YOU SO MUCH BOTH OF YOU

34
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,924
FOR BEING WITH US TODAY.

35
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:06,527
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A HUGE

36
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:07,828
PART OF YOUR LIFE, COMMITTED TO

37
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:09,096
BRINGING HIM HOME.

38
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:09,697
YOUR UNCLE BOBBY.

39
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:10,865
WHAT WOULD THIS MEAN TO YOU IF

40
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:14,168
YOU COULD DO THAT?

41
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,270
>> IT WOULD MEAN CLOSURE FOR OUR

42
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,039
FAMILY, IN PARTICULAR IT WOULD

43
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,275
MEAN THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED THAT

44
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:22,009
SOMETHING OUR GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS

45
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,878
WANTED US TO DO, AND THAT WAS TO

46
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:26,580
BRING OUR UNCLE BOBBY HOME TO

47
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,882
NORTH DAKOTA.

48
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:30,151
SO WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY

49
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:30,718
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

50
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:31,419
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT WOULD

51
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:33,554
MEAN THE WORLD TO US TO HAVE HIM

52
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:33,854
HOME.

53
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,890
>> Martha: THERE WAS A

54
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,693
HEADLINE IN AP AFTER THE SUMMIT,

55
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,862
AND THIS IS WHAT IT RED.

56
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:45,132
"TRUMP RETREATS FROM U.S. MORAL

57
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:46,100
LEADERSHIP STANCE."

58
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,901
GIVEN FROM WHERE YOU ARE COMING

59
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,502
FROM IN ALL OF THIS, DO YOU

60
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:52,506
THINK THAT'S TRUE?

61
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:53,707
>> YES, I THINK IT'S TRUE, BUT I

62
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:58,045
THINK IN OUR PARTICULAR CASE,

63
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,648
THIS IS THE FIRST MOTION, THE

64
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:01,582
FIRST MEETING AND IT'S GETTING

65
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:04,485
AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF ATTENTION

66
00:02:04,485 --> 00:02:08,856
AND WE EXPECT AN AMAZING AMOUNT

67
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:11,425
OF ATTENTION FROM IT.

68
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:14,328
>> Martha: YOU LEARN ABOUT THE

69
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:15,863
THOUSANDS, THE REMAINS THAT ARE

70
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:16,597
IN HAWAII SOMEWHERE AND I KNOW

71
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:19,266
NONE OF YOU KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS

72
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,268
OF THESE REMAINS AND YOU SPENT

73
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,204
SO MUCH OF YOUR LIFETIME WORKING

74
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,171
ON THIS, SO TELL ME ABOUT HOW

75
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,707
YOU FEEL ABOUT IT AND WHETHER OR

76
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:27,708
NOT, WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT

77
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,375
THE PRESIDENT SAID IN THAT

78
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,512
SOUND BITE AT THE BEGINNING.

79
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:32,913
>> WE ARE AMAZED.

80
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:34,281
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND

81
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,015
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY THAT HAS

82
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:36,417
EVER GIVEN OUR CASE ANY

83
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,686
ATTENTION AT ALL.

84
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:39,386
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED.

85
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:42,223
WE THINK IT'S THE FIRST STEP IN

86
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:43,557
MAKING A LOT OF HEADWAY TOWARDS

87
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:44,558
FINDING INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

88
00:02:44,558 --> 00:02:45,292
LOVED ONES.

89
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,026
THE REMAINS THAT THEY WANT TO

90
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:48,596
BRING BACK TO US WILL IDENTIFY A

91
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:51,599
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND SOME

92
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,501
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE

93
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,702
MAYBE NOT KNOWN TO BE KILLED IN

94
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:55,302
ACTION.

95
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:56,303
THEY WOULD JUST BE M.I.A. LIKE

96
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:59,306
MY FATHER'S CASE, WE ARE SIMPLY

97
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:00,741
MISSING HIM, WE DON'T KNOW IF HE

98
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:02,042
DIED IN A BATTLE FIELD, IF HE

99
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,211
WAS A P.O.W. OR JUST WHAT

100
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:04,879
HAPPENED.

101
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,114
SO BY DOING DNA ANALYSIS ON ALL

102
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,682
THESE REMAINS WE WILL BE ABLE TO

103
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:09,783
UNCOVER GOOD INFORMATION ON A

104
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:10,718
NUMBER OF THESE CASES.

105
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:14,421
FOR INSTANCE, IF MY FATHER, IF

106
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,623
ANY OF MY FATHER SCREW WANT TO

107
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:16,290
BE IDENTIFIED THEN WE WOULD

108
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,492
ASSUME THE PLANE TO CRASH AND

109
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:19,293
PROBABLY ALL OF THEM DIED.

110
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:21,095
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

111
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:21,462
HAPPENED.

112
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,898
>> Martha: IT MUST BE SO HARD

113
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:25,866
LIVING WITH THAT, JOHN.

114
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:26,367
ALL THESE YEARS.

115
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:28,903
>> IT CERTAINLY IS.

116
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:31,572
AS A YOUNG PERSON FOUR AND FIVE

117
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:33,107
YEARS OLD, THE MILITARY TOLD MY

118
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:35,109
FAMILY, MYSELF AND MY MOTHER

119
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,277
THAT IF THEY FOUND ANYTHING,

120
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,112
THEY WOULD CONTINUE LOOKING FOR

121
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,446
IT, IF THEY FIND ANYTHING AT ALL

122
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:40,881
THAT WOULD NOTIFY US

123
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:41,482
IMMEDIATELY.

124
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:42,516
I WAS THE PERSON IN THE FAMILY

125
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,552
THAT WENT TO THE MAILBOX EVERY

126
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,854
DAY LOOKING FOR THAT INFORMATION

127
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:47,788
DAY LOOKING FOR THAT INFORMATIO

128
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:48,189
INFORMATION.

129
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,690
AND NEVER RECEIVED IT.

130
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,926
IN 1995 THEY SENT ME A POSTCARD

131
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:52,660
SAYING THAT THEY ARE WILLING NOW

132
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,896
TO LOOK INTO THESE CASES AND SO

133
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:58,365
I FLEW UP TO D.C. TO MEET WITH

134
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:02,536
THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND I WAS NOT

135
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:03,904
EXACTLY PLEASED WITH WHAT THEY

136
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:05,005
INTENDED TO DO SO I STARTED

137
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:07,241
DOING MY OWN RESEARCH IN 1995.

138
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,276
>> Martha: I KNOW IT'S BEEN

139
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:09,710
EXTENSIVE.

140
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,978
JOAN, IN TERMS OF YOUR REACTION

141
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:14,181
TO WHAT YOU SAW PLAY OUT IN THIS

142
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:16,283
SUMMIT THAT WE WATCHED OVER THE

143
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,017
LAST 48 HOURS, WHAT WAS GOING

144
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:21,088
THROUGH YOUR MIND EVEN YOUR

145
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:23,324
FAMILY'S OWN CONNECTION TO THIS

146
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:24,291
WAR?

147
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:30,898
I'M SORRY, THAT WAS FOR JOAN.

148
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,032
>> WE WERE JUST SO GRATEFUL THAT

149
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:34,401
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK THE TIME

150
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,804
DURING THE SUMMIT TO ADDRESS THE

151
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,239
FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

152
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:41,275
MISSING SOLDIERS FROM THE KOREAN

153
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:41,542
WAR.

154
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,309
IT WAS VERY HEARTWARMING TO SEE

155
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:45,279
THAT THERE WAS CAIR THERE

156
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,280
FORGETTING OUR SOLDIERS BACK

157
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,580
HOME.

158
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,016
>> Martha: THEY TOLD      CALLED

159
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:49,049
>> Martha: THEY TOLD      CALLET

160
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:49,483
>> Martha: THEY TOLD      CALLEE

161
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,118
FORGOTTEN WAR, AND IT IS NOT

162
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:52,286
FORGOTTEN AND YOUR FAMILIES AND

163
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:53,487

00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,089
INDIVIDUALS AND YOU LOOK AT THE

165
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:57,191
PICTURES THAT WE JUST DID, FULL

166
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,192
OF SPIRIT AND FULL OF LIFE.

167
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:01,895
THESE YOUNG MEN WHO LOST THEIR

168
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:02,296
LIVES.

169
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:03,097

00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,698
