let me ask you something imagine a world where george w bush or god forbid president trump commissioned their official presidential portrait to be immortalized by a white artist who was made famous by painting portraits of white women decapitating black women and holding up their severed heads now switch the situation come back to the reality that president obama actually did this and no one seems to have a problem with it i'm ben davies this is pure Hollywood fiend a wily the man in question who did Barack Obama Michelle Obama's paintings was asked to clarify what these really dramatic and horrific images actually were about he told New York Times magazine quote it's sort of a play on the kill whitey thing unquote glad he set the record straight but don't worry I'm sure this was a one-time deal I mean artists do spend months and months and months on each one these images meticulously brushing each stroke on the canvas it's not like a photograph that you can mess up one time right no he actually did do other paintings exactly like this one depicting black women literally severing the heads off of white women and holding them up on a lighter note the graphic and racist depictions that this artist had put out there for the public who is now going to be immortalized because he did the official presidential portrait for Barack Obama at least he did include some very odd elements to this painting that we can all laugh at and kind of wonder about including random sperm like images strung throughout this weird painting that may or may not have actually been intended to be actual sperm and Obama clearly looking like he has a sixth finger on his hand hello my name is Antigua Montoya you killed my father prepare to die Princess Bride yeah I know yeah and like I said this is not a photograph this is a painting literally every stroke is a conscious calculated effort so in the end we can still laugh at some of this and continue to give a pass to people who are openly racist as long as they're racist towards the right people I've been tazed this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content and the entire rebel lineup you
