America and the UK have a special thing going a special relationship they call that language culture values defense then came Trump but surely he can't ruin it right the special relationship between the UK and the US has been strong for many years we'll have opportunity to talk about our possible future trading relationship really remember Barack Obama when he came around they couldn't get enough of him everyone wanted to shake his hand get a picture what a swell guy Trump just doesn't have the charm it seems we're Abama was greeted with cheers and applause Trump gets protests and outrage even a giant Trump baby balloon and Americans being told to avoid drawing attention to themselves be aware of your surroundings exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings keep a low profile one would imagine a special relationship would be a little friendlier but what do we know protists a hip and this explosive and politically divided age of us but why the hate okay Trump did slap Britain and Europe with painful tariffs on steel and aluminium and mrs. May certainly wasn't happy about it we expressed deep disappointment at the unjustified decision of the United States to apply tariffs to steel and aluminium imports it cannot be done by taking unilateral action against your partners then there was the whole Iran mess so much efforts years of work to get around to verifiably stop pursuing nuclear weapons and and Trump torpedoes it but come on he couldn't have been alone Britain's always been there for the states Donald Trump undermine progress towards normalization of relationships with around I have been very clear in a number of conversations with the President of the United States about the belief of the United Kingdom that the jcpoa the nuclear deal with Iran should stay then there's the brexit shenanigans mase government and strategy are in shambles she needs friends to back her and who better than the u.s. the people voted to break it up so I would imagine that's what they'll do but maybe they take it a little bit of a different route so I don't know if that's what they voted for well that wasn't very helpful no Trump did offer the UK a tariff free trade deal if it really ditches the EU but goodness me there's very little that's special in this relationship aside from how fast it's using its specialness and on top of that Trump being Trump just had to rub salt in the wound I'm going to a few hot spots we have NATO that we have the UK and then we have Putin and I said Putin may be the easiest of them all you never know but I'm going to a pretty hot spot right now right with a lot of rest a lot of resignations come on that's just nasty saying it's easier to talk to Putin then to your allies but there you go how's that for friends it's like the phrase goes with friends like these who needs enemies you
