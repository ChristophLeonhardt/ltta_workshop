people had never been active in politics told their stories at town hall meetings flooded the congressional switchboard with calls speaking out for affordable health care these were not only activists and advocates they were people who had something to say and were determined to be heard yes some were new to the fight and other other leaders like congresswoman nancy pelosi have been on the front lines for years and when this disastrous bill failed it was a victory for all american just look at all that's happened in the last few days two women who were simply doing their jobs April Ryan a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room when she was patronized and cut off tried to ask a question recently photos have been making the rounds on social media showing groups of men in Washington making decisions about women's health decisions to strip away coverage for pregnancy and maternity care or limit access to reproductive health care around the globe we shake our heads and think how could they not have invited any women to the table well a provocative opinion piece in The New York Times this week argues that it may not be an oversight at all but an intentional signal don't worry the men are in charge of everything but let me let you in on a little secret the other side never quits sooner or later they'll try again we will need to fight back twice as hard not for the sake of politics but because these are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction
