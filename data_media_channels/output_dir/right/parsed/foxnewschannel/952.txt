"THE STORY" HOSTED BY
MARTHA MacCALLUM STARTS RIGHT
NOW.
MARTHA.
>> Martha: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AN
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW RIGHT OFF
THE TOP.
SOUTH CAROLINA REPRESENTATIVE
MARK SANFORD HAS NEVER LOST AN
ELECTION IN HIS LONG CAREER
UNTIL LAST NIGHT.
THE REPUBLICAN HAS NOT BEEN SHY
WHEN IT COMES TO CRITICIZING THE
PRESIDENT.
>> IF YOU WOULD JUST SHUT UP,
QUIT ATTACKING -- I DON'T WORK
FOR HIM, WORK FOR 750,000 PEOPLE
HERE IN THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICT.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD
IN INTERVIEWS ABOUT DRUM, HE'S
NOT SORRY FOR ANYTHING.
I THINK THAT'S A PROFOUND
MISTAKE.
>> Martha: COMMENTS LIKE THAT
THAT MAY HAVE LED TO A STINGING
LAST-MINUTE TWEET FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WENT LIKE
THIS.
MARK SANFORD HAS BEEN VERY
UNHELPFUL TO ME IN MY CAMPAIGN
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
HE IS M.I.A. AND NOTHING BUT
TROUBLE.
HE IS BETTER OFF IN ARGENTINA.
I FULLY ENDORSE KATIE ARRINGTON
FOR CONGRESSMAN IN
SOUTH CAROLINA, SHE'S TOUGH ON
CRIME, VOTE KATIE SAID THE
PRESIDENT.
SANFORD'S OPPONENT KATIE
ARRINGTON ALSO WENT AFTER HIM IN
ADS LIKE THIS.
>> I'M RUNNING FOR CONGRESS TO
GET THINGS DONE, NOT TO GO ON
CNN TO BASH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IT'S TIME FOR MARK SANFORD TO
TAKE A HIKE, FOR REAL THIS TIME.
>> Martha: LAST NIGHT BEFORE
THE FINAL VOTES WERE COUNTED
MARK SANFORD WAS FEARING THE
WORST.
>> IT'S FAIRLY UNUSUAL FOR A
PRESIDENT TO TWEET IN A
CONGRESSIONAL RACE.
I'M NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST
FROM.
I'M FOR IDEAS THAT I HAVE LONG
STOOD FOR OVER THE ENTIRETY OF
MY TIME IN POLITICS.
IT MAY HAVE COST ME AN ELECTION
IN THIS CASE BUT I STAND BY
EVERYONE OF THOSE DECISIONS.
>> Martha: 'S SEAN SPICER WILL
JOIN US IN JUST A MOMENT ON
WHETHER HE THINKS THIS IS A
LESSON PERHAPS FOR OTHER
REPUBLICANS RUNNING IN THE
MIDTERMS.
HERE EXCLUSIVELY TONIGHT, WE ARE
GLAD TO HAVE SOUTH CAROLINA
CONGRESSMAN MARK SANFORD JOINING
US.
CONGRESSMAN, WELCOME.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
OBVIOUSLY LAST NIGHT WAS A ROUGH
NIGHT FOR YOU.
YOU HAD A VERY STRONG, LONG
CAREER IN POLITICS IN
SOUTH CAROLINA.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP COST YOU THIS
ELECTION?
>> I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS THE
TWEET, BUT IT WAS REDUCED TOWN
IT WAS FOR TRUMP VERSUS NOT.
I LOST THAT RACE.
>> Martha: DO YOU SAY THAT AS
A WARNING TO OTHER CANDIDATES
OUT THERE?
WOULD YOU CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT
YOUR CAMPAIGN?
>> WE ALWAYS MONDAY AFTERNOON,
QUARTERBACK CAMPAIGNS AND THOSE
THINGS YOU COULD'VE DONE A
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, THAT'S
THE NATURE OF LIFE.
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS,
THE WARNING IS FOR ALL OF US
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT MY ACTUAL
VOTING RECORD I HAVE BEEN WITH
THE PRESIDENT 89% OF THE TIME,
SO 11% I HAVE DISAGREED ON, BUT
I LOVE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
IT DOESN'T MEAN I AGREE WITH
THEM ON 100%, 100% OF THE TIME.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL
OF US TO STOP AND SAY WAIT A
MINUTE WE HAVE AN INSTITUTION
SET UP BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS,
WHERE VIGOROUS DISSENT,
DISAGREEMENT WAS PART OF IT.
THEY WANT THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
TO BE A CHECK ON THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH AND VICE VERSA.
WHEN WE LOSE THAT, IF THE LITMUS
TEST OF OUR ELECTIONS, WHO IS
100% IN ALLEGIANCE WITH SOMEBODY
ELSE, I THINK WE HAVE LOST AN
AWFULLY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT
MAKES OUR COUNTRY SPECIAL AND
UNIQUE BASED ON THE FOUNDING
FATHERS DESIGN.
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK IT WAS
WRONG FOR HIM TO DO THAT?
TO PUT THAT WEED OUT THERE AND
GET INVOLVED IN THE PRIMARY AT
THAT LATE MOMENT?
>> IT'S AMERICA.
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO DO WHAT
THEY ARE GOING TO DO AND THE
PREROGATIVE TO DO WHAT HE WANTS
TO DO ON THAT FRONT.
BUT AGAIN, THE ISSUE IS DO WE
WANT TO HAVE LITMUS TEST, AND
ALLEGIANCE TEST IN RUNNING FOR
OFFICE, OR DO WE SAY LOOK, IF
YOU ARE WITH ME 90% OF THE TIME,
BECAUSE I VOTED FOR EVERY SINGLE
AGENDA --
>> Martha: MAY BE THE REVERSE
IS ALSO TRUE.
IF  IF YOU ARE AGREEING SO MUCHW
IF  IF YOU ARE AGREEING SO MUCHT
IF  IF YOU ARE AGREEING SO MUCHH
THE THINGS THAT HE'S PUTTING OUT
THERE AND YOU ARE VOTING WITH
HIM 90% OF THE TIME, WHY GO ON
TV AND BASH THEM IF YOU FEEL
LIKE GENERALLY HE'S MOVING IN
THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO?
>> IT'S NOT A BASH.
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE GOING RIGHT
NOW.
I WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND THEY
BELIEVE IN THE SOCRATIC PROCESS,
YOU THREW AN IDEA DOWN THE
MIDDLE AND YOU'RE DEBATED LONG
ENOUGH.
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.
>> AND THAT IS IMPORTANT.
THAT'S THE AMERICAN WAY.
WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE.
I FOR INSTANCE VOTED AGAINST THE
OMNIBUS BILL.
I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT BOAT.
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AS LEADER
SAID HE WON'T SIGN ANY MORE THAT
SAID HE WON'T SIGN ANY MORE THA
THAT.
BUT TO SAY I DISAGREE WITH WITH
THE BILL ULTIMATELY IS AGAIN A
STAND TIED TO ISSUES AND BELIEFS
THAT I HAVE LONG HELD THAT ARE
IMPORTANT TO THE CONSTITUENTS
THAT I REPRESENT.
I DON'T VIEW IT AS SOMETHING
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT THOUGH IT
WAS CERTAINLY CAST A SOMETHING
IN THIS RACE.
>> Martha: THIS IS WHAT
SENATOR BOB CORKER SAID ABOUT
REPUBLICANS AND THE PARTY RIGHT
NOW.
>> WE ARE IN A STRANGE PLACE.
IT'S ALMOST -- IT'S BECOMING A
CULTISH THING.
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR ANY
PARTY TO END UP WITH A CULT-LIKE
SITUATION AS IT RELATES TO A
PRESIDENT THAT HAPPENS TO BE
REPORTEDLY OF THE SAME PARTY.
>> Martha: WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?
>> WHAT MY OPPONENT SAID LAST
NIGHT, HER WORDS WERE THIS IS
THE PARTY OF DONALD DRAKE FROM.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THE PARTY
OF DONALD DRAKE TRUMP.
IT IS THE PARTY OF THE TAXPAYERS
OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA
AND FLORIDA AND GO ACROSS EVERY
STATE IN THIS UNION.
THERE WERE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS
OUT THERE WHO WORKED THEIR
SOULS, THEY WORKED HARD FOR
YEARS STUFFING ENVELOPES AND
DOING ALL THE THINGS YOU DO IN
POLITICS.
THAT'S WHO THE PARTY BELONGS TO
IN THIS NOTION THAT ANYBODY AT
THE TOP -- WE ARE A NATION OF
LAWS AND NOT MEN, SHOULD SOMEHOW
BE THE PERSON --
>> Martha: IT SOUNDS TO ME
THAT YOU JUST DON'T LIKE HIM
PERSONALLY, BUT MOST OF THE
TIME, 90% OF THE TIME YOU LIKE
WHAT HE'S DOING.
IS IT PERSONAL FOR YOU, AND IS
THAT NECESSARILY WISE?
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMY,
YOU LOOK AT NORTH KOREA, YOU
LOOK ACROSS THE BOARD.
DOES ANY PART OF YOU SAY MAYBE I
SHOULD HAVE JUST SORT OF --
>> NOT DISAGREE?
>> Martha: KEPT TO MYSELF
ABOUT HOW I FELT ABOUT HIM
PERSONALLY.
>> I WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK AT MY
RECORD.
I HAVE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT
HIM PERSONALLY.
WHAT I HAVE DISAGREED WITH WERE
CERTAIN STANDS THAT HE TOOK AND
I THINK THAT IS LEGITIMATE FAIR
GAME IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS.
>> Martha: IT CERTAINLY IS,
ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IS YOUR CAREER OVER IN POLITICS?
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
>> BELIEVE ME, I'VE LEARNED
NEVER TO SAY NEVER, BUT THAT
WOULD CERTAINLY BE MY TAKE.
BUT IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO
REPRESENT FOLKS BACK HOME IN
SOUTH CAROLINA FOR A WHILE NOW.
I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A
WAKE-UP CALL ABOUT THE
INSTITUTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY,
ABOUT WHAT WE BELIEVE ON THAT
FRONT AND ULTIMATELY A WAKE-UP
CALL WITH REGARD TO THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THOSE
STRONG STANDS IN TERMS OF
CONSERVATISM AND TAX POLICY
MATTER MORE OR DOES ALLEGIANCE
THAT ARE MORE?
>> Martha: WOULD YOU AND FOLKS
LIKE BOB CORKER SPLITTING OFF
AND MAYBE RUNNING A CANDIDATE
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT IN 2020?
>> NO.
I'M A DAY OUT OF MY ELECTION.
I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON MAKING A
