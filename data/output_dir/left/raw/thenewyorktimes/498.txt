00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:26,838
They were just good guys, far as I knew.

4
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:31,628
I have to say honestly, they were happy
in Atalissa.

5
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:37,288
We never had any reason to doubt.

6
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:42,873
Even though they were adult men, they
were boys to us, they were like our boys.

00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:45,158
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

8
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:49,258
It's just hard to realize, how old they
were as they didn't seem that old.

9
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:56,287
I'm sure some of us, a lot of us maybe,
had second thoughts that we should have.

10
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:02,488
Looked into it a little deeper, but again,
when you'd ask the boys how's it going, and

11
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,678
none of them ever said well, this happened to
me or this happened to me or whatever.

12
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,038
I never heard them complain.

13
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:14,143
You know, it didn't cross my mind that 
they were being abused.

[MUSIC]

15
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,897
Routine can be a dangerous thing 
for all of us.

16
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:23,489
Because we stop looking outside of 
our to-do list for the day.

17
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,402
So things that are happening around us,
sometimes

18
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:31,070
we miss them because we just weren't looking.

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:41,070

And they'd go [SOUND of 
TURKEY CALL].

23
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:25,088
And they'd talk right back to me.

00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:48,818
Narrator (NR): For more than 30 years, 
Willie Levi belonged to a crew

25
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:53,148
of men working some of the 
worst jobs at the turkey plant.

26
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:58,823
Reaching into crates, grabbing live 40 pound
birds, and sending them to be slaughtered.

27
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:04,242
Then they'd eviscerate the carcasses
and pull out the guts.

[SOUND].

29
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:26,916
Takes three fingers.

30
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,248
You gotta pull it this way and you gotta take
and pull it all down at the same time.

31
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:31,740
All that.

32
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:25,358
NR: The men have never publicly spoken 
at length about their experiences.

33
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:46,828
NR: Now, most of them are 
in their sixties.

34
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,488
Retired, but without any pension.

35
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:52,268
Or, in many cases, any savings.

36
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,992
Back in the early 1970s, the men were part of
an experimental work program in Texas.

37
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:04,346
That at the time was seen as progressive.

38
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:12,020
It would also benefit the two ranchers behind
the program, T.H. Johnson and Kenneth Henry.

A little bit amazing when you think 
about all the boys.

42
00:05:57,068 --> 00:06:01,678
You know we had very few that went through
the program that I would call lazy.

43
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:03,908
They didn't mind getting up.

44
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:06,638
After they'd been here awhile and kind of
knew the routine.

45
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:09,308
Get up and go do whatever we had to do.

46
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:13,798
They were getting better, and they 
were taking pride in that.

I can do this.

48
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,948
For what reason?

49
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:20,298
What reason were they so positive 
when they came here?

50
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:23,978
They wanted out of that place they were in.

51
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:25,118
They didn't want to be there anymore.

52
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:29,038
They didn't want somebody filling 
their plate.

53
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,838
They didn't want to set in front 
of the TV all day every day.

And do nothing.

55
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:38,858
NR: These men, many without family, 
some as young as 11 years-old,

56
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:44,188
had been living in Texas institutions for the
developmentally disabled, or "state schools,"

57
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:44,953

59
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:52,438
Meanwhile, in the Texas town of Goldthwaite,
rancher T.H. Johnson saw opportunity.

60
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,908
For years, he had benefited from

61
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:58,988
a controversial government arrangement 
called the Bracero Program,

62
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:03,618
in which Mexicans were allowed to
cross the border for farm work.

63
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,701
When that program was shut down in 1964,

64
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:13,408
Mr. Johnson and Mr. Henry devised a new
program, one that would take in

65
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:17,303
the men from the state schools and 
train them in job and life skills.

[MUSIC]

67
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:22,848
This way, the rancher's business, Henry's
Turkey Service, would receive cheap labor,

68
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:27,568
while also helping the men to avoid being
warehoused in an institution.

69
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:31,571
They could work and they could pay
their own way.

70
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,108
That's what the program was.

71
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:41,578
NR: Eventually, Henry's Turkey Service
began to subcontract crews of these men

72
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:46,167
to poultry businesses in other states,
including a turkey processing plant in Iowa.

73
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:55,478
So, in 1974, a dozen or so men from the ranch
in Goldthwaite were trucked north to work

74
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:57,618

may be the last meeting for the ABC's.

bypassed Atalissa.

97

One by one, the towns businesses
began to close up.

feed mill and a fertilizer plant.

changed when the town leased an old
schoolhouse to Henry's Turkey Service.

106
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,883

We just knew that they were contract

At first, the town kept their distance
from these new neighbors,

110
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:57,498
who'd be seen tending to the flowers 
on the schoolhouse lawn.

Or walking down the hill to the minimart.

112
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:04,828

They went to church here.

Americans for Disabilities Act.

the 20th century,

people with disability.

But not for the Henry's Boys in Atalissa.

190
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:22,888
Many of them had come to Iowa in their
twenties, and were now nearing middle age.

191
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:28,028
(Denny Spilger) Some of them were 60 and 65, 
you know, I'm thinking 

192
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:32,718
high-thirties or mid-forties. So I 
underestimated their age like by 20 years.

They had little to show for years of
hard work.

196
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:45,910
Now they didn't really understand, that
they were working to

197

clothes and all that stuff.

"The Magic of Simplicity,"

Henry's Turkey Service outlined a typical
financial arrangement for its workers.

200
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:09,208
The company deducted nearly all of 
their pay to cover lodging and care.

201
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:14,818
This odd but legal arrangement

202
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,854
caught the attention of both 
labor regulators and

203
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:20,571
The Des Moines register as early as 1979.

204
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:22,598
But nothing changed.

205
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:28,694
By 2000, the men were still taking home 
just $65 a month.

206
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:31,948
As little as 44 cents an hour --

207
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:35,457
the same amount they had been receiving for
the last 25 years.

208

But things were changing around the
bunkhouse.

209
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,793
In the mid-1990s a local couple, Randy and

210
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:47,588
Dru Neubauer, were hired to help 
supervise the men.

211
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:50,868
Like all supervisors inside the 
schoolhouse, they had no

212
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:55,838
experience or training in caring 
for people with disability.

213
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:58,218
They put up the do not enter

00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:03,658
property signs, and, when, Randy and 
Dru kind of took over.

00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:07,218
When you have a rental property,

the schoolhouse property to do some
maintenance work.

00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:21,528
And that's when I first noticed that

221
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:26,508
the doors were chained and locked 
from the outside.

harassed them at the plant.

Hit. Kicked. Forced to stand in place 
with their hands on a pole.

228
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:31,238
One man was even handcuffed to his bed.

At one point Gene Berg underwent chemotherapy
for throat cancer.

230

Henry's Turkey Service that its

and verbally abusing the men.

232
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,498
Neubauer was eventually banned from the
plant.

233
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,588
They wouldn't let him go into Louis
Rich any more

234
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:09,498
because he went in there an, and was
being a complete idiot.

235
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:12,248
And they banned him from going in.

236
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:17,268
And so if he acted that way there, it's hard
telling how he was acting in there.
