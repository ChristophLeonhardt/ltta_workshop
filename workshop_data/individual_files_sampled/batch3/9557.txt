A BREAKAWAY GROUP OF MIGRANTS FROM THE CARAVAN MOVING THROUGH GUATEMALA HAS REPORTEDLY REACHED THE BORDER WITH MEXICO. THIS COMES HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENED TO SEND IN THE MILITARY TO SECURE THE BORDER IF THE MIGRANTS AREN'T STOPPED. THE PRESIDENT BLAMING DEMOCRATS FOR THE NEW CRISIS ON TWITTER, CLAIMING THEIR SUPPORT OF WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS IS MAKING THE SITUATION WORSE. MEANWHILE, NANCY PELOSI IS PUTTING HER FOOT DOWN SAYING HER PARTY ISN'T PLANNING ON WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. SHE SAYS, I'M SORRY I DON'T SEE ANY OF US VOTING FOR WALL FUNDING. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SECURE OUR BORDERS. THERE ARE WEIGHTS TO THAT CONSISTENT WITH CIVILIZATION, HUMANITARIANISM, AND WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. WE HAVE TO REMOVE ALL DOUBT ABOUT THAT. WITH ONLY 19 DAYS GOING TO THE MIDTERMS, A NEW FOX NEWS PROCESS WITH EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO VOTERS. 46% STATES IMMIGRATION. I WANT US SHOW THIS OTHER ONE. FOX NEWS POLL SAYING BORDER SECURITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AT 58%, DENIGRATE AT 35% DEMOCRAT OF3 DENIGRATE AT 35% DEMOCRAT OF% DENIGRATE AT 35% DEMOCRAT OF. THIS NEW CARAVAN MOVING ITS WAY NORTH, NOT GOOD TIMING FOR DEMOCRATS. Jesse: VISUALLY IT HAS A BIG IMPACT ON VOTERS WHEN THEY SEE THIS. IT'S NOT A THEORETICAL PROBLEM. NOT JUST THIS ONE CARAVAN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IN TERMS OF SIZE, CARAVANS LIKE THIS ARE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER ALL DAY EVERY DAY, AND THERE'S REALLY NOT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE LOOPHOLES ARE BAKED INTO OUR IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM SYSTEM. IT USED TO BE ADULT MALE MEXICANS CROSSING THE BORDER. NOW IT'S MOSTLY FAMILIES AND TEENAGERS FROM GUATEMALA AND FROM HONDURAS. WE CAN'T TURN THEM BACK. THE MEXICANS YOU COULD, BUT YOU HAVE TO BRING IN AND TAKE, WHEN YOU APPREHEND THEM, INTO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE CLAIMING CREDIBLE FEAR. CREDIBLE FEAR, THAT EXCUSE HAS SPIKED OVER THE COUPLE YEARS. YET WHEN THEY USE IT, THE ECONOMY IN HONDURAS IS GOING UP, YET CRIME IN HONDURAS IS GOING DOWN. IT MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING COACHED. YOU ARE HEARING THINGS LIKE NGOs SENDING ACTIVISTS AND LAWYERS DOWN TO CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE HELPING THEM WITH THE CARAVAN. THEY ARE COACHING THEM ON WHAT TO SAY WHEN THEY GET TO THE BORDER. IT'S INTERESTING. WHERE DO THEY GET THE CAMERAS FROM? WE ARE HEARING A LOT OF THESE NGOs ARE BRINGING THESE CAMERA CREWS IN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PEOPLE GET OFF THE VAN, THEY WALK WHEN THE CAMERA CREWS COME OUT. THE CAMERA CREW STOP REPORTING AND THEY HOPPED IN THE VAN. ONCE I GET TO MEXICO, THEY PAY THE DRUG CARTELS AND THE SMUGGLERS $5,000 PER FAMILY UNIT TO GET THEM ACROSS. THE DRUG CARTELS ARE THE ONLY ONES MAKING ANY MONEY IN THIS PROCESS. THE DRUG CARTELS AND THE OPEN BORDER DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE ON THE SAME SIDE. THESE DRUG CARTELS HAVE MADE $2.5 BILLION IN SMUGGLING ALONE PER YEAR. THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DRUG PROFITS, AND THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS SO THAT YOU TREAT PEOPLE WHO CROSS THE BORDER IF YOU ARE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA THE SAME WAY YOU DO IS IF YOU ARE FROM CANADA AND MEXICO. Dana: KENNEDY, THE OTHER THINGS, IN THESE CARAVANS, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY REPORTING THAT THE NUMBER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TAPPING ALONG THIS ROUTE AND NOT JUST IN THE CARAVAN, AS JESSE WAS SAYING, 1600 MIGRANTS TRY TO CROSS THE BORDER A DAY. THEY ARE FINDING REPEATED INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, FOR CHILDREN EVEN. THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE BOARD. Kennedy: IT'S HORRIBLE. WE SAW SOME OF THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE SHELTERS IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE FLORENCE. IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE ASPECT OF HUMAN NATURE. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO LET REALLY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY AND KEEP REALLY BAD PEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY. THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T DONE THAT AND I THINK PART OF IT REST ON CONGRESS BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT A VERY CONFUSING IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, I AM CONVINCED THIS IS THE ONE ISSUE WHERE THEY WILL NEVER WORK TOGETHER BUT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRESIDENT, EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND H EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND R EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND - EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND I EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND E EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND R RHETORICALLY AND IMMIGRATION, THERE'S A LOT HE WOULD GIVE TO DEMOCRATS IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH COMPROMISE. I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD SEE THAT WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND REPUBLICANS IN THE SAME WAY OR WITH PAST REPUBLICANS ADMINISTRATIONS. THEY NEED TO FIX IT. IF YOU THINK BY THE KIND PEOPLE YOU WANT TO HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU WANT PEOPLE ARE HARDWORKING COME PEOPLE WHO ARE ETHICAL, PEOPLE WHO LOOK OUT FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY PHYSICALLY STRONG. I THINK WE NEED TO SET UP AN AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR AT THE BORDER AND WHOEVER CAN MAKE IT CAN'T MAKE IT. Dana: THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO HELP THOSE COUNTRIES WITH AID, CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, CRIME IS GOING DOWN IN HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA AND YET THE CARAVAN STILL COME. Juan: I THINK ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT LEAD FAMILIES TO DECIDE THAT THEIR BEST PROSPECT IS TO COME TOWARD THE UNITED STATES. AS WE KNOW, THEIR ECONOMIES HAVE BEEN SUFFERING. I THINK THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE REASON. I'M INTERESTED IN THIS AS A POLITICAL PLOY BY REPUBLICANS BECAUSE CLEARLY IMMIGRATION IS NOT A BIG ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, 7% OF PEOPLE SAY IT'S A BIG ISSUE. AND THAT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS HEALTH CARE. Kennedy: ACCORDING TO THE POLL DANA JOE SHALL COMMENCE NUMBER FOUR. Juan: EXTREME PEOPLE. THE BIG ISSUE IS HEALTH CARE NEW START LOOKING AT THE SECONDARY ISSUE, RANDY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND THE THIRD ONE IS PEOPLE WHO WANT DEMOCRATS TO CONTROL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Dana: WHAT ABOUT THIS ISSUE? WE HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS OTHER ISSUES BUT WHAT ABOUT NANCY PELOSI SAYING THAT THEY WON'T WORK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. TO ME, IT'S NOT A RIGHT AND LEFT ISSUE. IT'S EFFECTIVE YOU HAVE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, WITH CHILDREN BEING SENT TO THE HOSPITAL AS THEY HAVE TO STOP AT WEIGH STATIONS. THEY ARE DEHYDRATED. SOME OF BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. IF THEY GET HERE IT'S NOT TRUE? Juan: I SAID IT'S NOT GOOD. Dana: NOT GOOD. WHY WOULD NANCY PELOSI BE SIGNALING? Kennedy: I NEED TO PUSH BACK ON YOU, JUAN. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CORRECTION. IT WASN'T EXTREME VOTERS. IT WAS A POLL OF LIKELY VOTERS. Juan: NO, NO, PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTREME THE CONCERN. Dana: AMONG THOSE WHO SAY IT BORDER SECURITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. Juan: OKAY, I THINK YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND NANCY PELOSI IS TALKING ABOUT THE WALL AND ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS PERSISTENCE I THINK YESTERDAY WE QUOTED HER AS SAYING THAT IT WAS A MANHOOD ISSUE. IT'S A POLITICAL ISSUE. HE SEES IT AS A PROMISE HE MADE WAS BASIN HE WANTS TO DELIVER FIRST BASE BUT IF YOU GO BACK IN TIME, REMEMBER GOING BACK TO PRESIDENT BUSH, PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU ARE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WORKING ON THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE, WORKING ON BORDER SECURITY. TRUMP HAS MADE IT ALL ABOUT THE WALL, AND WHAT NANCY PELOSI IS SAYING HEY, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE WALL. IT'S NOT A GOOD EXPENSIVE MONEY OR TIME AND CERTAINLY NOT TO BE MEAN TO PEOPLE. Dana: ONE OF THE THINGS NANCY PELOSI SAYS IS THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. Greg: IT'S A COP-OUT. IT'S DISGUSTING. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AS JUAN SAID, BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OBAMA UNDERSTOOD BORDER SECURITY HELPS TO FIND A COUNTRY AND LIKE IT OR NOT, THE WALL IS ACTUALLY PART OF BORDER SECURITY. HOW COULD IT NOT BE? WE HAVE FENCES. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT INTERESTED IN PUTTING UP A WALL. IF YOU ARE ON SAFARI AND YOU ARE BEING CHASED BY A RINO, YOU HAPPEN TO THE FIRST ROCK. YOU DON'T WAIT FOR THE FOURTH ONE. THERE'S A HUGE DISHONESTY GOING ON. THEY IGNORE THE LAND BETWEEN HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES. IMAGINE HOW MANY LIVES WILL BE SAVED AND HOW MANY RAPES WOULD BE PREVENTED IF THEY WERE ABLE TO STOP. ONCE THEY LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY AND LAY CLAIM TO SOME LAND RATHER THAN RISKING THEIR LIVES MAKING IT TO THE BORDER. IT'S A HUGE HYPOCRISY THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE JOURNEY BECAUSE FOR SOME KIND OF POLITICAL OPTICS. I HATE USING THE WORD OPTICS. TO YOUR POINT, WHERE IS THE ME TOO MOVEMENT? YOU ARE PUTTING WOMEN IN DANGER FOR THIS ISSUE. WHERE ARE YOU? HOW CAN YOU ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN? THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY DISGUSTING. Kennedy: YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT ABOUT MEXICO. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS TO MAKE YOU TAKE SOME OF THE HYPERBOLE AND RHETORIC OUT OF IT AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING, HE'S APPEALING TO MEXICO. ASIDE FROM THREATENING TO SHUT DOWN THE SOUTHERN BORDER, BUT THEY DO HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE, AND THEY DO OPEN UP BOTH BORDERS IN ORDER TO SOME PEOPLE FURTHERMORE WITH. IT'S A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE. MEXICO IS A HUMANITARIAN COUNTRY WITH PEOPLE WHO CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH, THEN WHY DON'T THEY HAVE BETTER SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO ABSORB SOME OF THE REFUGEES? Greg: THE OTHER LIE IS THAT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS MAKE YOUR LIFE PUT YOUR LIFE IN THREAT. IT'S LIKE NO, IT'S LIKE STAY IN THE COUNTRY AND DEAL WITH THESE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. Juan: WE HAVE A HISTORY IN AMERICA PEOPLE FROM CUBA GETTING ON THE HIGH SEAS. Greg: WHEREVER THERE IS LEFTISM, THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER. Juan: THERE'S A HISTORY OF PEOPLE PUTTING THEMSELVES AT GREAT RISK IN ORDER TO REACH OUR SHORES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN AMERICA. THEY LIKE THE FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY. Greg: THERE IS SOMETHING BETWEEN HERE AND THEY ARE: MEXICO. Juan: WE HAVE A BETTER, STRONGER ECONOMY THAN MEXICO. Greg: YOU HAVE A MENU OF OPTIONS YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM. Juan: I'M TELLING YOU THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES ARE FOCUSED ON. I THINK THEY ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN. Dana: WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING JESSE SAID. THAT IS THAT THE DRUG CARTEL, APPARENTLY THERE'S NOT A SINGLE PERSON THAT'S COME ACROSS THE BORDER BUT HASN'T HAD TO PAY SOME SORT OF MONEY AS A FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL TO THE DRUG CARTELS. PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HE COULD FIND A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT, FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HER TARGET OF THE DRUG CARTELS, THE LEADERS OF THEIR FINANCES, AND SHUT THEM DOWN. Jesse: THEY ARE MAKING FISTFULS OF CASH EVERY DAY FROM THE SMUGGLING OPERATIONS ON TOP OF THE PROFITS THEY ARE MAKING FROM HEROIN, COCAINE, AND MARIJUANA. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITION THEY ARE IN BY HAVING OPEN BORDERS POLICIES ONLY EMPOWERS THE DRUG CARTELS. IT EMPOWERS NO ONE ELSE. ONLY THE DRUG CARTELS. I AM HAPPY THAT JUAN WOULD ADMIT THAT THE TRUMP ECONOMY IS SO STRONG, PEOPLE ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES TO COME TO AMERICA TO GET A PIECE OF THE PIE. Juan: I SAID THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. BY THE WAY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID. I DON'T GET IT. YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS NOTHING
