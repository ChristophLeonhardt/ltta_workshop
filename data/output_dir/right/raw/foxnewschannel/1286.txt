00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:00,804
TARGET.

CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

3
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:02,605
JOHN ROBERTS STARTS US OFF AS HE

4
00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:04,674
ALWAYS DOES, IT SEEMS FROM THE

5
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:05,075
NORTH LAWN.

6
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:07,143
>> IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

7
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:09,412
I SWEAR.

8
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:10,580
AS YOU SAID, OFFICIALLY THE

9
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,581

00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:15,385
PRESIDENT'S CANCELLATION LETTER.

12
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,187
BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

13
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:19,189
DIPLOMATIC POSTURE, IT WOULD

14
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,790
SUGGEST THAT UNOFFICIALLY AT

15
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,524
LEAST, THIS MEETING LOOKS LIKE

16
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:23,993
IT IS BACK ON.

17
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,562

00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,006
OUR SECRETARY OF STATE HAS HAD A

25
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:37,774
VERY GOOD MEETINGS.

26
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:39,976
HE IS MEETING AGAIN TODAY.

27
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,411
I BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE

28

00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:43,747

00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:57,694
ME FROM KIM JONG UN, SO I LOOK

36
00:00:57,694 --> 00:00:59,629
FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT IS IN THE

37
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:00,396
LETTER.

38
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:01,965
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP LOWERING

39
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:03,600
EXPECTATIONS FOR HIS PLANNED

40
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,367

41
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,402
IF IT HAPPENS IT MAY BE JUST THE

42
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:07,337
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS.

43
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:08,605

00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:11,207
ALONG VERY WELL.

46
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:12,809
BUT I WANTED TO BE MEANINGFUL.

47
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:15,245
IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT GETS

48
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:16,012
DONE AT ONE MEETING.

49
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:17,447
MAYBE YOU HAVE A SECOND OR

MAYBE WE WILL HAVE NONE!

52
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:22,218
>> THE PHRASE MAYBE WE WILL HAVE

53
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:23,653
NONE COULD ALSO APPLY TO ROBERT

I WILL NOT LET MY CLIENT

60
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:33,696

THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

76

>> IF AND WHEN WE FIND THAT THIS

77
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:00,256
WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY AND

78
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:01,758

GIULIANI SAYS THAT HE WOULD DO

120
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:07,790

THOSE PEOPLE, THEY APPEARED ON

00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,774
"CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" THIS DID

150
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,776
NOT SIT WELL WITH SOME OF THE

151
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:00,510
