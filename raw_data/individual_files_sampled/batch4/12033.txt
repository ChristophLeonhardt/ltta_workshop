in the spirit of disagreeing just a little bit I'm curious what your thoughts are on American accept exceptionalism because I am on the left and I think a lot of what you say makes sense but I often get frustrated when I hear Americans America is so exceptional we are number one because it seems to derail that whole starting point that you start with which you got to realize first that you kind of suck before you can actually in 20 years get better so what would your response be to someone who says America's number one there's no point in saying anything different well my must be is a it's absurd first at first American exceptionalism doesn't mean that and this is another thing makes me nuts because people say American exceptionalism like it means we're great it doesn't it means no one has had this idea before that we are supposed to be that free you know we're always hearing well in Europe they do this and Europe Europe had kings for 2,000 years and did nothing but kill each other you know I mean it was great culture beautiful paintings but still you know we are exceptional because of these ideas that that makes us an exception we're exceptional because I lived overseas for seven years you can move to any other country on earth and you will never belong to that country here ten minutes after you caught the train you're an American and people treat you like an American I mean we really do we really do well look the individuals are individuals and individuals suck I mean that is the truth but but you know this is a country there's never been a place like this before
