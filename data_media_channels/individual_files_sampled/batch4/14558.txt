it's been exactly one week since Tommy Robinson was arrested and thrown in jail for 13 months now ostensibly the reason was contempt of court what a lot of people aren't buying that when you look at what Tommy did that day he wasn't on court property he was saying nothing libelous he was reporting nothing that hadn't been reported by the mainstream British press so what is the real reason Tommy Robinson is behind bars right now is it because of who he is and what he says well millions of people around the world are not happy with this including dozens here who have assembled outside the British Consulate in Toronto to vent their rage and frustration about what they consider to be a miscarriage of justice what have they done there regarding these rape groups what have they done nothing it's up to a citizens and Tommy the Tommy's of the world I think God for them for putting themselves in harm's way to expose what is going on within our country at Tommy Robinson is the victim of a police state right now I'm really really discouraged about what's happening in the mother country really we can't allow that to happen here we have to be very careful next year we have to remove the regime that we have in Ottawa right now because they pander to all of this and that's why I'm here if Britain loses free speech Canada is gonna be next I believe in free speech and I don't believe what happened to Tommy was rape no matter what country it's in and it's happening in the UK which means it's gonna happen here with things like m103 c16 before you know it they're gonna be throwing our own citizens in jail for the same reason the play is already written in the players were just following the script that they were handed which guess what ladies and gentlemen that's what happened we watched a play called the arrest of freedom and Tommy Robinson was the lead actor in that play I do think he's a political prisoner I absolutely would agree with that statement there's no doubt about it the grandfather's a great grandfather's of the British people now fought what they are they what they have become Land of Hope and Glory mother they're free not anymore and this is a free world fight this is the Americans fight as much as it's the Canadians fight and the Australians and everybody else in the free world if we don't stop this encroachment on our freedom we're going to end up slaves to the one-world Cabal obviously he's the canary in the coal mine that Canada's watching very closely and they're gonna roll it out on you you're the next one that's going to be targeted if it works on Tommy if there's not enough outrage if we can't muster more than 50 people because everyone watches cable everyone accepts the answer that's easiest for them to digest it everyone's racist and if you call that out you don't need to think anymore on uncomfortable things so Tommy is the speaker of uncomfortable things rape is a crime for God's sakes and going after minors are you kidding the entire country should be up in arms you know protesting this needs to stop enough of this political correctness enough of trying to trying to you know like embrace an ideology that doesn't fit in with our country and if it goes against everything every one of our laws and what we're going to throw people in jail because they're speaking up against the crimes that they're they're committing how is that right how is that right what is happening to society wake up people if we don't step up what's gonna happen here our media fake news is not allowed to the broadcast any of this they don't want us to know anything about what's happening in the UK right now for fear that Canadians may start to wake up hey folks may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download the rebel media app and take the rebel with you wherever you go
