big news today Tommy Robinson fights back for real and it's time for us to help him after private conversations with his family I'm delighted to announce a way that we can all help that has been authorized and approved by Tommy and his family including Tommy's wife and Tommy's mother Tommy has switched lawyers he now has a top law firm that is filing an appeal I believe they are giving Tommy the world-class representation that he needs I will let their legal work speak for itself but it is my view that finally someone is addressing everything from Tommy's treatment in prison to the hasty manner in which Tommy was tried and convicted and of course the shocking 13 month prison sentence I have directed the British law firm that we at the rebel used last year for Tommy when he was working for us and was charged with contempt of court in Canterbury to give Tommy's new lawyers any assistance they require including all of Tommy's files and with the approval and authorization of the family I've undertaken to cover all of the fees of Tommy's new legal team Tommy's family has also asked me to email this news to all of our rebel supporters both in the UK and elsewhere to invite people to contribute to this legal defense fund at the website save Tommy calm I want to maintain the confidentiality of my conversations with the family but I will tell you a word about how the crowdfunded money will be handled as agreed to by the family 100% of all proceeds will be used to cover Tommy's legal costs we anticipate this will be tens of thousands of pounds but that's fine this is the most important legal case in the United Kingdom in my view I truly believe that Tommy Robinson is a kind of political prisoner and this case touches on freedom of the press and the increasing police restrictions on ordinary Brits talking about public issues like Muslim rape gangs and mass immigration if we raise more than is required to pay the legal fees we will give 100% of the surplus to Tommy's family Tommy's family will have complete access to the financial accounts in my view this family we fund is very important if tommy is released it could be used as a future Legal Defense Fund for him if Tommy is not released his family could use it to pay their bills while tommy is in prison and god forbid i hate to even mention it but it is a possibility god forbid if something happens to Tommy while he's in prison or on another occasion these funds could assure that Tommy's family is taken care of in the future all surplus funds will be transferred to Tommy's wife and she will have complete discretion over them today is the day we fight back in a manner that Tommy and his family have approved there are other things we can all do and I salute everyone else who has been doing important things like outstanding rallies both in the United Kingdom and around the world and even just speaking out in the media even on social media this crowdfunding project is our specialty at the rebel and we've done it for Tommy before when he worked with us let's do it for Tommy again and for his family please go to save Tommy calm he's been there for us now let's do this for him he'll pay Tommy's legal fees in a fund approved by his family go to save Tommy calm
