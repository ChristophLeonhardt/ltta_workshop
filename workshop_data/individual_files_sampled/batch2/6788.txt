a recent report by Politico indicates that Donald Trump is using cell phones that are not secure and could potentially be hacked if they haven't been hacked already to give you the details on this Trump apparently regularly uses at least two government-issued iPhones one a burner device capable of only making calls and another that's loaded with a Twitter app and a handful of new sites now Trump's call only phone this is where the problem lies has a camera and microphone features that can be exploited by hackers so under the Obama administration when Obama had a government issued phone that phone was only able to make calls he wasn't able it did not have a microphone or a camera on it but Trump's phone is obviously very different and it is vulnerable to hacking now as for the phone Trump uses for Twitter which is the phone that he probably uses the most the president reportedly has rebuffed his staffs advice to swap the device every month saying it would be quote too inconvenient hmm well I wouldn't want to convenience you the other thing I have to say is lock him up lock him up because this is literally one of the charges they had against Hillary Clinton when they were chanting lock her up not just a private email server which is very close to this but no she literally had a phone where she would use both her she would use the phone both for her private emails and for her State Department emails and that was a phone that was more secure than these he has two phones that are less secured but they said oh my god he she exposed all of our government information on an unsecured phone line lock her up lock her up so I'm sure the Trump voters being principled people that they are now believe that Donald Trump should be arrested immediately for the same exact thing well look based on what we've known so far from investigations into Russia and other foreign governments it appears that at least members of trumps campaign loved having very close ties to foreign governments that had very specific financial interests right and and that's one of the reasons why they were so eager to get Trump elected or support Trump over Hillary Clinton so I don't know maybe he's friends with all these foreign countries and he does have to worry about anyone hacking him so who knows maybe he's less of a threat so I mean look by the way if you are on an unsecured phone and you're the president you're not a ravaged oh okay paranoia is justified they the foreign governments like China but you couldn't keep listing them Russia Israel Sat Arabia it does doesn't matter even probably some of our allies like Israel Germany etc they will all try to hack the president's phone and they're pretty good at it so they might have all of his phone calls now imagine if they started releasing those what do you think Trump said in those private phone calls especially the people who raised money for him and then wanted deals good I'm I told you the one reason that I was fairly sure that he's not gonna get away with any of his crimes etc is because of how stupid he is well he always gets himself in trouble with his own words on social media and it's it's interesting to see him you know place himself in an incredibly vulnerable situation just so he can use these unsecured phones to put out those tweets that sometimes get him into trouble but one of the one part that really stood out to me and politico's reporting was that Trump has gone for as long as five months without getting his Twitter phone checked by security experts so that's that's a big deal five months is an incredibly long time but the White House has responded to this report and they're saying no no no everything's fine a senior West Wing official told POLITICO that the call only phones are seamlessly swapped out on a regular basis through routine support operations because of the security controls of the Twitter phone and the Twitter account it does not necessitate regular change out I don't I'm not buying that at all and remember this story came forward because of staffers who went and spoke to Politico and told them what going on with these phones I mean these leaks keep happening they can't stop the leaks but I think that leaks like this are so important because we need to know what the vulnerabilities are and maybe someone can talk some sense into him who cares if your inconvenience you're the President of the United States that's a giant inconvenience right like but anyway but he's gotta have his Twitter account oh but I'm mad at somebody I got a tweet right away but that's fine have your Twitter account just like make sure the phone is secure viki's but remember he's he's a dotard so he is like the new phone he'll have trouble figuring out but I just got used to his phone I just figured out how to do the all-caps so now look the NSA we know can and does have a database of recording of our conversations now they say that they're collecting just the people that we called and the phone numbers that we call not necessarily that content of the conversations but there's very good reason to be skeptical about that so if our NSA can do it and we know for a fact that they can do it the question is whether they are doing it right you think NSA equivalent in China can't do it and the president's like I sometimes cover up the I know now a lot of people do write like the camera on your laptop or whatever it is right and back in the day people are like oh you're crazy now everybody's like well yeah that makes sense we know we've done how many stories about how they could look through the camera like a lot of the the sexual predators they figure out a way to access your computer they look through the camera then they take naked pictures of you and then extort it right and this is an old trick the president's phone has a camera and a microphone one other thing I wanted to mention look people forget stories because especially in today's news cycle there's too much going on of course it's easy to forget remember North Korea hacked into the email systems for Sony Pictures right oh yes it's yes forgot about that and right now we're in the middle of this conundrum with North Korea by the way we're gonna get to that story later on on today's show but it's terrifying to know that in the midst of these negotiations regarding D nuclear North Korea they could potentially have the ability to hack into Trump's phones because those phones are incredibly vulnerable by the way t y-t-dot-com /join to get the whole show and my final thought is though on the upside we're going to have some hilarious video of Donald Trump one day like imagine on his foot like hey what is this man I'm so angry somebody gave me a cheeseburger I can't wait to tweet against the New York Times there's a fairly New York Times oh the pictures of him all with his bald spots and his uh Noren j complexion in the morning or whatever he does that thing so it's disastrous for the country but at least they'll be amusing videos two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT
