AS PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUES HIS SEARCH FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR OUTGOING UNITED NATIONS AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY, MANY EXPERTS OFFERING OPINIONS ON WHO WE SHOULD CHOOSE. ACCORDING TO AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER CONRAD BLACK, THE TOP CHOICES SITTING HERE WITH ME NOW. IN A RECENT ARTICLE, HE WROTE I SUGGEST NEST YOUR SEMESTER SHOULD BE ANN COULTER. HER POLITICAL VIEWS UNLIKE AMBASSADOR HALEY HAVE LONG BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. SHE'S BEEN VERY ACCOMPLISHED MANY YEARS.ACCUSTOMED TO BEING VASTLY OUTNUMBERED BY OPPONENTS OF HER UNAPOLOGETIC CONSERVATIVE VIEWS AND WOULD NOT BE PHASED IN THE SLIGHTEST BY THE OPPOSITION OF 192 OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS , ANN COULTER IF NOMINATED WOULD YOU SERVE? OF COURSE, CONRAD BLACK IS A VERY SERIOUS INTELLECTUAL AND WE SHOULD TAKE ANY SUGGESTION HE MAKES SERIOUSLY. OF COURSE I WOULD! BUT I WOULD HAVE TO STEP ASIDE FOR MY CHOICE WHICH IS, THE PRESIDENTS DAUGHTER, IVANKA TRUMP. FOR ONE THING, IT GETS RELATIVES OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. ANOTHER THING, I THINK IT'S INSULTING TO THE UN. I'M SENTIMENTAL. ONE THIRD THING, JARED ANDY ONE THIRD THING, JARED DY ONE THIRD THING, JARED JARED ANDY DY Y WHAT'S YOUR TAKE? I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT NOT ONLY IS RICK SHOWING WHAT AN AMBASSADOR CAN DO, WE HAVE NOT KNOWN REALLY WHAT INVESTORS ARE CAPABLE OF BECAUSE HIS WORK IN GERMANY HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY. HE'S BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THE PRESIDENT FROM THE BEGINNING. HE OF COURSE, HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE AT THE UN WITH MULTIPLE U.S. AMBASSADORS TO THE UN. AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THIS IS A GUY THAT AMERICA ALREADY LIKES. WE KNOW HE UNDERSTANDS THE PRESIDENTS AGENDA AND IS ABLE TO MOVE IT FORWARD. AND I BELIEVE HE IS UNDER SOME SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS IS THAT IT HAS TO BE A WOMAN. AND LOOK, I WANT WOMEN TO DO WELL, OBVIOUSLY AS WELL. I SPENT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE WORKING FOR THAT. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS SO MANY TALENTED WOMEN THAT REALLY WE CAN GET RID OF THE QUOTA NOTION AND NATURALLY, WOMEN ALREADY IN GOOD CONDITIONS, WILL BE IN MORE GOOD POSITIONS AND IT MEANS THAT OF COURSE, THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB SHOULD GET IT. IN THIS CASE IT IS RICK. I LIKE THE IDEA. I JUST WANT TO SEE THE CONFIRMATION HEARING! I WANT TO SEE YOU SITTING THERE AT THE DESK AND THEN YOU SEE LIKE CORY BOOKER AND KAMALA HARRIS ASKING YOU QUESTIONS. JUST WAITING FOR THE ANSWERS. STEVE: AND WHAT ABOUT MENENDEZ? I WOULD THAT WOULD LIGHT IT UP. EXACTLY RIGHT. WILL BE SO FUN TO SEE THEIR HEADS EXPLODE. IT REALLY WOULD BECAUSE COULD YOU SEE CORY BOOKER READING PASSAGES FROM ONE OF YOUR BOOKS? HOW WOULD THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? I HAVE SEEN CHUCK SCHUMER ALREADY HAS REJECTED A HISPANIC NOMINEE, THE GREAT MIGUEL ESTRADA. DEMOCRATS REJECTED A HISPANIC NOMINEE BECAUSE HE WAS THANKING ONE OF MY BOOKS. MY GOSH! I WANT HIM TO START READING FROM CLUELESS. THERE IS A REFERENCE THAT IS RELEVANT. I THINK IT'S A JOKE. EVERYTHING WE WOULD TRY TO GET
