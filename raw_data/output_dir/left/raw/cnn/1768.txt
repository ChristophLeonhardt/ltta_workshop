1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,049
you said back here in Charlottesville
that those folks have a right to protest

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,090
why doesn't a furnace have his First
Amendment rights I think the NFL is in a

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,400
box I think they're a really bad box you
look at what's happening with their

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,670
ratings you look at what's going I mean
frankly the only thing that's doing well

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,420
in the NFL is the pregame because
everybody wants to see what's going on

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,890
the NFL is in a very bad box you cannot
have people disrespecting our national

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,660
anthem our flag or a country and that's
what they're doing and in my opinion the

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,379
NFL has to change or you know what's
going to happen their business is going

9
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,890
to go to hell

10
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,149
no not at all no no we have to respect
our National Anthem

11
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,530
we have to respect our country and
they're not respecting our country and

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,750
most importantly the fans agree with me
I mean largely the fans agree but we

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,170
have to show total respect for our
national anthem for a flag for our

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,550
country we have to do it and you can
there are plenty of places and there are

15
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,530
plenty personally when they're
protesting during a football game I

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,700
think they can find better places but
they cannot do it during the national

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:00:00,000
anthem
