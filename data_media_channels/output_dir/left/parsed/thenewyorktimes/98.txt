Hi.
I’m Susanna Fogel.
And I am the director and
co-writer of ‘The Spy Who
Dumped Me.'
“Oh my god, I killed someone!
I killed someone!"
O.K., Mila Kunis and
Kate McKinnon on the run,
not equipped for the spy caper
they’ve found themselves in.
And here they go.
They see a car.
Now this car was rigged
on a push-pull system.
And they jump in.
The car’s in neutral.
It’s got these intense,
heavy cables rigged up to it
so we could try to make it
go as slowly as possible
for comic effect, which is
harder than you’d think.
And especially hard was having
it go slowly enough that
people could walk alongside
it and yet with enough impact
that it could knock
over this magazine rack,
which we found it
really couldn’t.
So we had to attach a
separate cable to that rack
and have this sort of opposing
push-pull pulley elaborate
system, all of which went into
the making of this extremely
short, low-octane scene.
