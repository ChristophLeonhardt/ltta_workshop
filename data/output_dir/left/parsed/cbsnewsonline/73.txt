HIMSELF BUT MAYBE PRIMARILY FOR 
HIS BROTHERS. 
>> DOUG, LET'S TALK A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT THAT. 
FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW 
HIS STORY, YOU KNOW, HE COMES 
FROM A MILITARY FAMILY. 
AND HE GRADUATED FROM THE 
MILITARY ACADEMY ALMOST AT THE 
BOTTOM OF HIS CLASS. 
HE WASN'T A STELLAR STUDENT AT 
ALL BUT WHEN HE WENT TO VIETNAM 
HE WASN'T THERE VERY LONG 
BEFORE HE CHEATED DEATH ONCE 
VERY QUICKLY AND THEN SHORTLY 
AFTER THAT BECAME A PRISONER OF 
WAR. 
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
THAT? 
>> YEAH. 
THERE WAS NO GUARANTY THAT ANY 
OF THOSE MEN WERE GOING TO 
LIVE. 
AND YOU'LL REMEMBER JEREMIAH 
DENTON WHEN THEY WERE SHOWING 
THESE PROPAGANDA MOVIES TO THE 
WORLD THEY WERE DENYING TORTURE 
AND JEREMIAH DENTON BLINKED 
WITH HIS EYES IN MORSE CODE 
TORTURE AND THAT VIDEO WAS 
QUIETLY SHOWN IN EMBASSIES 
AROUND THE WORLD THAT THE 
VIETNAMESE WERE INDEED 
TORTURING THESE MEN. 
IF YOU READ THE PASSING OF THE 
NIGHT THE RANDOM HOUSE BOOK BY 
GENERAL ROBINSON RISER TO GIVE 
YOU AN IDEA OF THE DEPTH OF THE 
TYPE OF TORTURE THEY WENT 
THROUGH AND THERE WAS EVERY 
LIKELIHOOD THAT JOHN MCCAIN WAS 
GOING TO DIE THERE FAR AWAY 
FROM THE PEOPLE THAT HE LOVED. 
IT WAS A REAL MIRACLE HOW THE 
WAR ENDED AND THOSE PRISONERS 
OF WAR WERE RESCUED AND THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW. 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE 
AMERICANS STILL CARED ABOUT 
THEM AND WERE WORKING TO BRING 
THEM HOME. 
SO IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT 
THEY WENT THROUGH BUT IT'S A 
GREAT STORY OF A VERY 
COURAGEOUS MAN. 
>> I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OF 
WHAT WE ARE WATCHING RIGHT 
HERE. 
THE SENATOR'S BODY HAS LEFT THE 
CAPITAL BUILDING IN PHOENIX AND 
IS HEADING TO THE NORTH PHOENIX 
BAPTIST CHURCH WHERE THERE WILL 
BE A CEREMONY A LITTLE BIT 
LATER ON. 
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL 
BE SPEAKING AT THAT CEREMONY 
ALONG WITH LARRY FITZGERALD AND 
ARIZONA CARDINALS PLAYER. 
BUT ALSO VICE PRESIDENT DAN 
QUAIL WILL BE THERE 24 SITTING 
SENATORS WILL BE THERE AS WELL 
AS FOUR FORMER SENATORS AND OF 
COURSE FAMILY MEMBERS AND 
FRIENDS OF THE MCCAIN FAMILY. 
AFTER THAT THE BODY WILL BE 
MOVING ON. 
HE'LL BE TRANSPORTED HEADING TO 
WASHINGTON D.C. BUT THIS IS AN 
OPPORTUNITY OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS FOR THE STATE OF 
ARIZONA TO SAY THEIR FINAL 
GOODBYES TO THEIR SENATOR. 
HE HAS REPRESENTED THEIR STATE 
FOR DECADES. 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED UP. 
WE ARE GETTING A NUMBER BETWEEN 
1 AND 15,000 PEOPLE WALKING 
PAST HIS BODY IN THE CAPITAL 
BUILDING. 
JUST TO SAY GOODBYE BUT ALSO TO 
SHARE STORIES WITH EACH OTHER 
AND AT ONE POINT SOME OF HIS 
CHILDREN ARRIVED AND THEY WERE 
ABLE TO SAY THANK YOU TO HIS 
CHILDREN AND TALK ABOUT JUST 
HOW IMPORTANT HE WAS TO THE 
STATE OF ARIZONA BUT ALSO TO 
THEM PERSONALLY. 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WATCHING 
RIGHT NOW. 
THE MOTORCADE TRANSPORTING THE 
BODY OF JOHN MCCAIN TO THE 
NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH. 
AND I'M TALKING TO DOUG WEED, 
HISTORIAN ABOUT THE LEGACY OF 
THIS GREAT MAN. 
I JUST--YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK 
OF HIM I JUST THINK OF SORT OF 
THE BEST DEFINITION OF WHAT WE 
EXPECT AN AMERICAN TO BE. 
YOU KNOW, YOU TALKED ABOUT WHEN 
HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR. 
HE HAD LEFT BEHIND A NEW WIFE, 
A YOUNG DAUGHTER AT THE TIME 
AND HE DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO JUMP IN FRONT OF OTHER 
AMERICANS AND COME HOME BEFORE 
THEM AND HE SAID NO. 
>> YEAH. 
HE DIDN'T DO IT. 
THAT'S A PRETTY AMAZING MOMENT 
AND ANNE-MARIE REMEMBER, I 
REITERATE THIS POINT. 
WHEN HE MADE THAT DECISION, 
THERE WAS EVERY LIKELIHOOD THAT 
HE WAS SIGNING HIS OWN DEATH 
WARRANT AT THE TIME AND HE KNEW 
IT BUT HE WOULDN'T GIVE THE 
NORTH VIETNAMESE EVEN THAT 
SMALL PROPAGANDA VICTORY. 
AND I THINK PART OF THAT WAS 
THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD WITH HIS 
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. 
IT WAS A MOMENT, A TRANSCENDENT 
MOMENT WHERE HE SUDDENLY BECAME 
EVERY BIT AS GOOD AND AS GREAT 
AS THE MEN THAT HE HAD HEARD 
ABOUT ALL HIS LIFE AS A LITTLE 
BOY. 
>> YEAH THIS WAS A FAMILY THAT 
FOR THIS FAMILY'S SERVICE TO 
COUNTRY BUT SERVICE TO OTHERS 
WAS SORT OF THE HIGHEST 
ACHIEVEMENT THAT'S PART OF WHAT 
MILITARY SERVICE WAS FOR JOHN 
MCCAIN BUT THEN WHEN THERE WAS 
NO LONGER MILITARY SERVICE, HE 
CHOSE TO SERVE THIS COUNTRY AS 
A POLITICIAN. 
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
WHAT SERVICE MEANT TO HIM 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE 
ENTERPOLITICS FOR ALL SORTS OF 
REASONS NOW SOME OF THEM NOT SO 
HONORABLE BUT IT CERTAINLY 
SEEMS LIKE JOHN MCCAIN WAS 
DRIVEN BY A DESIRE TO IMPROVE 
THOSE AROUND HIM, IMPROVE THE 
LIVES OF THOSE AROUND HIM. 
>> YEAH I DON'T WANT TO 
EXAGGERATE THAT BECAUSE HE WAS 
A SUPERB POLITICIAN AND LIKE 
ALL POLITICIANS TO SURVIVE IN 
WASHINGTON D.C., HE HAD HIS 
FAVORITE. 
THE FAVORITE CORPORATIONS AND 
THE FAVORITE LOBBYISTS THAT HE 
WORKED WITH BUT HE WOULD OFTEN 
GO AGAINST THE GRAIN AND 
TOTALLY DEFY THEM AND TAKE A 
DIFFERENT TACK IN THAT SENSE 
HIS INTEGRITY WOULD TRIUMPH 
OVER A VERY USEFUL POLITICAL 
CHANCE TO IMPROVE HIS OWN 
STANDING. 
SO IT'S SOMETHING OF A 
PHENOMENON HOW HE ROSE TO THE 
TOP AND RAN FOR PRESIDENT TWICE 
AND ALMOST WON. 
ALMOST BECAME A PRESIDENT. 
>> YEAH. 
YOU MENTIONED THE KEETING FIVE. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS LONG 
CAREER AS A POLITICIAN THERE'S 
TWO AREAS THAT JUMP OUT AS 
PERHAPS AREAS THAT HE MIGHT 
HAVE THOUGHT WERE MISS STEPS. 
THE SAVING AND LOAN SCANDAL 
WITH THE KEETING FIVE AND THE 
CHOICE OF SARAH PALIN AS A VICE 
PRESIDENT RUNNING MATE BUT HE 
LEARNED A LOT. 
HE WAS INVESTIGATED AND HE WAS 
JUDGED POLITICALLY. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT 
CHAPTER OF HIS CAREER MEANT TO 
HIM AND WHAT HE LEARNED FROM 
IT. 
>> ANNE-MARIE THAT'S SUCH A 
DRAMATIC MOVING STORY TO ME 
THAT I ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT IT 
TO MY CHILDREN AND MY 
GRANDCHILDREN. 
I USE IT AS A LIFE EXPERIENCE 
FOR THEM BECAUSE THE KEETING 
FIVE WENT TO THE PRISON OF THE 
FIVE SENATORS THREE OF THEIR 
CAREERS WERE ABSOLUTELY CUT 
SHORT TWO OTHERS AND ONE OF 
THEM BEING MCCAIN CONTINUED TO 
SURVIVE AND HAVE A CAREER BUT 
HIS NAME WAS BLACKENED. 
THIS WAS FRAUD. 
THIS WAS A GREAT CONTROVERSY. 
IT RUINED THE CAREERS OF MANY 
PEOPLE ALL AROUND CREATING. 
JOHN MCCAIN CAREFULLY 
LABORIOUSLY TEDIOUSLY DAY BY 
DAY, STEP BY STEP REBUILT HIS 
LIFE BACK FROM THE KEETING FIVE 
VANDAL TO BECOME KNOWN TO 
BECOME FAMOUS AS A PERSON OF 
INTEGRITY TO THE POINT THEY 
CALLED HIS BUS DURING THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THE 
STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS TO THE 
POINT THAT HE REACHED ACROSS 
THE AISLE AND WAS THE ONLY ONE 
ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT 
COULD HELP THE DEMOCRATS COME 
UP WITH A PROGRAM TO REFORM 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE. 
THAT IS A MARVELOUS MOMENT AND 
I TELL MY CHILDREN AND I TELL 
MY GRANDCHILDREN WHEN SOMETHING-
-WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG OR 
SOMETHING HURTS YOU OR YOU ARE 
PERCEIVED TO HAVE DONE 
SOMETHING WRONG IT ISN'T FATAL. 
IF YOU ARE NOT DEAD IT'S NOT 
FATAL AND THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF 
THAT IS JOHN MCCAIN WHO BECAME 
THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE 
STORY OF THE CREATING FIVE 
SEEMED TO SAY. 
>> DEFINITELY TRUE. 
WE PLAYED AN INTERVIEW WITH 
LINDSAY GRAHAM A LITTLE BIT 
EARLIER TODAY. 
JOHN DICKERSON DID. 
AND JOHN ASKED HIM, LINDSAY 
GRAHAM WHAT SENATOR MCCAIN 
WOULD BE SAYING TO HIM RIGHT 
NOW AND HE SAID SENATOR MCCAIN 
WOULD BE SAYING BUCK UP, RIGHT? 
THAT--AND ALSO THAT YOU ARE 
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF. 
ASKS ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE 
SAY THAT IS REFRESHING AS A 
POLITICIAN IS TO SAY I MADE A 
MISTAKE AND DID SOMETHING WRONG 
AND ATTEMPT TO CORRECT IT. 
I WONDER HOW HE FELT ABOUT 
THESE--NOT THAT THESE PROBABLY 
GO TOGETHER POTENTICALLY BUT 
HIS TWO ATTEMPTS TO BECOME THE 
PRESIDENT FIRST BEATEN AT THE 
PRIMARY LEVEL BY GEORGE ATTEMPT 
BECOME THE PRESIDENT MEANT TO 
HIM, EVEN IN THOSE LOSSES? 
>> I NEVER TALKED TO HIM ABOUT 
THAT, BUT I KNOW HOW BIRTHER 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS CAN BE. 
-- HOW BITTER POLITICAL 
CAMPAIGNS CAN BE. 
AND YOU'LL REMEMBER GEORGE BUSH 
WHO'S GOING TO BE HERE AT THE 
FUNERAL, YOU KNOW THAT GEORGE 
BUSH'S CAMPAIGN AMBUSHED HIM IN 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
>> YES. 
>> SAID HE WAS THE FATHER OF A 
BLACK CHILD, SAID THAT HE WAS A 
TRAITOR. 
TRIED TO PULL OUT OF CONTEXT 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN NORTH 
VIETNAM, AND THAT WAS JUST LIKE 
KICKING JOHN MCCAIN IN THE 
STOMACH. 
IT'S ONE THING TO TAKE TORTURE 
FROM COMMUNISTS IN VIETNAM FAR 
FROM HOME WHO BELIEVE YOU'VE 
INVADED THEIR COUNTRY AND TO BE 
HURT AND HAVE YOUR BONES BROKEN 
AND BE TORTURED BY THEM, 
SOMETHING ELSE TO HAVE A FELLOW 
IN THE SAME POLITICAL PARTY 
KICK YOU IN THE STOMACH LIKE 
THAT. 
BUT, LOOK WHO'S SPEAKING AT HIS 
FUNERAL IS GEORGE W. BUSH. 
SO JOHN MCCAIN HAD THE ABILITY 
TO FORGIVE HIMSELF AFTER 
KEATING FIVE AND REBUILD A 
CAREER THAT PROVED THAT AS AN 
ABORRATION, AND HE HAD THE 
ABILITY TO FORGIVE PEOPLE WHO 
HURT HIM IN ORDER TO CONTINUE 
TO DO GOOD THINGS FOR AMERICA. 
>> YEAH, SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM 
THE WAY THE SENATOR LIVED HIS 
LIFE. 
DOUG WHEAT, I WANT TO THANK YOU 
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. 
>> THANKS, ANNE MARIE. 
>>>  WELL, CBS NEWS CHIEF 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT 
NANCY CORDES IS AT THE NORTH 
PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH WHERE 
TODAY'S SERVICE IS BEING HELD. 
YOU'RE JUST OUTSIDE THERE. 
WE ARE SORT OF WATCHING ON A 
SPLIT SCREEN, NANCY CORDES. 
THE MOTORCADE HEADING YOUR WAY. 
WHAT'S THE SCENE LIKE THERE 
WHERE YOU ARE? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, RIGHT BEHIND 
ME, ANNE MARIE, YOU CAN SEE THE 
MILITARY HONOR GUARD WAITING TO 
RECEIVE THAT CASKET AND CARRY 
IT INTO THE CHURCH WHERE THERE 
ARE THOUSANDS, LITERALLY 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
ALREADY GATHERED, FAMILY, 
FRIENDS, CONSTITUENTS, MEMBERS 
OF THE PUBLIC HAVE BEEN INVITED 
IN AS WELL TO PAY TRIBUTE TO 
THE MAN WHO REPRESENTED THIS 
STATE FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS. 
HERE'S A PROGRAM AS WE AWAIT 
HIS ARRIVAL. 
IT SAYS JOHN SIDNEY McCAIN, 
UNITED STATES SENATOR WITH 
LANDSCAPE OF WHAT WE ASSUME 
WOULD BE SEDONA, HIS BELOVED 
SEDONA, THE RANCH WHERE HE 
PASSED AWAY SEVERAL DAYS AGO. 
THE PROGRAM IS QUITE EXPENSIVE. 
AND EVERYTHING IN IT IS 
PERSONALLY MEANINGFUL -- 
EXTENSIVE AND EVERYTHING IN IT 
IS PERSONALLY MEANINGFUL TO 
JOHN MCCAIN HIMSELF. 
HE HAND SELECTED EVERYONE HE 
WANTED TO SPEAK, EVERYONE HE 
WANTED TO HEAR FROM. 
FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER THE WELCOME 
AND INVOKES, WE'LL HEAR FROM 
THE ENSEMBLE, THE SCHOOL THAT 
HIS TWO SON, JACK AND JIMMY 
ATTENDED. 
SO IT'S A SCHOOL THAT THE 
McCAIN FAMILY HAS BEEN 
AFFILIATED WITH FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME. 
A READING BY HIS DAUGHTER 
BRIDGET AND A READING BY HIS 
SON ANDY McCAIN AS WELL. 
WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE 
McCAIN CHILDREN YET. 
WE SAW THEM OF COURSE AT THAT 
VERY SOLEMN CEREMONY AT THE 
ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL 
YESTERDAY. 
CLEARLY THIS IS A FAMILY THAT 
IS GRIEVING, AND THAT'S WHY IT 
WAS SO SURPRISING TO SEE FOUR 
OF THE McCAIN CHILDREN COME 
BACK TO THE CAPITOL LATE LAST 
NIGHT AND THANK PEOPLE WHO HAD 
COME TO STAND IN LINE TO SEE 
McCAIN AS HE WAS LYING IN STATE 
IN THE ROTUNDA OF THE ARIZONA 
STATE CAPITOL. 
AND HE JUST SHOOK HANDS AND 
SAID HELLO TO PEOPLE WHO WERE 
VERY SURPRISED WHEN ONE OF 
McCAIN'S SON, SAID, OH, WELL, 
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, IT'S GREAT 
TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM 
BECAUSE I'M HIS SON. 
AND, YOU KNOW, WAS SORT OF 
HEARTWARMING FOR EVERYONE, I 
THINK, A VOTE FOR THE 
CONSTITUENTS WHO WERE QUITE 
MOVED BY THE EXPERIENCE AND 
ALSO FOR THE MEMBERS OF HIS 
FAMILY WHO WERE SURELY 
COMFORTED BY THE FACT THAT 
THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE 
WHO LOVED HIM THE WAY THAT THEY 
DID. 
>> INDEED. 
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL 
BE SPEAKING. 
HE KNEW THE SENATOR VERY WELL. 
ANY HINT AS TO WHAT THE FORMER 
VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE SAYING 
IN HIS REMARKS? 
>>REPORTER:  YOU KNOW, IT'S 
ALWAYS HARD TO PREDICT EXACTLY 
WHAT JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO SAY, 
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS NO 
EXCEPTION. 
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP IS THAT THEY HAVE 
BEEN FRIENDS SINCE THEY WERE 
BOTH YOUNG MEN, SINCE BEFORE 
JOHN MCCAIN EVEN ENTERED THE 
SENATE. 
HE WAS THE NAVAL LIAISON TO THE 
SENATE, AND IN THAT CAPACITY HE 
HELPED, WORKED WITH A YOUNG 
SENATOR FROM DELAWARE NAMED JOE 
BIDEN. 
AND THEY ACTUALLY TRAVELED THE 
WORLD TOGETHER ON MILITARY 
DELEGATIONS, AND THAT'S HOW 
THEY FIRST GOT TO KNOW ONE 
ANOTHER. 
AND THEN OF COURSE JOHN MCCAIN 
MARRIED HIS WIFE GINNED, MOVED 
TO HER HOME STATE -- CINDY, AND 
MOVED TO HER HOME STATE OF 
ARIZONA, EMEDDED UP RUNNING IN 
PRETTY SHORT ORDER FOR THE 
HOUSE AND A FEW YEARS LATER FOR 
THE SENATE WHERE HE THEN 
REJOINED HIS FRIEND JOE BIDEN 
AS A COLLEAGUE. 
AND THEY SPENT DECADES 
TOGETHER, AGAIN, TRAVELING, 
DUKING IT OUT ON THE SENATE 
FLOOR, PRAISING EACH OTHER ON 
THE SENATE FLOOR. 
THESE ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM MAKING 
FRIENDSHIPS THAT CROSSED PARTY 
LINES. 
AND SO I THINK THEY HAD A 
SIMILAR SENSE OF HUMOR, THEY 
WERE BOTH VERY GREGARIOUS, THEY 
BOTH LIKED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. 
THEY BOTH LOVED TO TALK, AND 
I'M SURE THAT THEY HAD A LOT OF 
TIME TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ú 
SO I THINK WE'LL HEAR SOME VERY 
INTERESTING STORIES FROM JOE 
BIDEN TODAY ABOUT THEIR TIME 
TOGETHER. 
>> AND ALSO SOMEBODY ELSE 
SPEAKING TODAY, LARRY 
FITZGERALD. 
AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE MIGHT 
BE SURPRISED BECAUSE IT SEEMS 
LIKE AN UNLIKELY CHOICE. 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT. 
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S RIGHT. 
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, JOHN MCCAIN, 
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT HIM 
IS THAT HE HAD FRIENDS FROM 
ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM 
AND FRIENDS WHO HAD NOTHING 
WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH POLITICS. 
LARRY FITZGERALD, WIDE RECEIVER 
FOR THE ARIZONA CARDINALS FOR 
13 SEASONS, JOHN MCCAIN WAS A 
BIG SPORTS FAN HERE IN ARIZONA. 
HE WENT TO GAMES ALL THE TIME, 
AND SO HE ASKED LARRY MONTHS 
AGO IF HE WOULD SPEAK AT THIS 
SERVICE. 
ANOTHER INTERESTING APPEARANCE 
AT THE SERVICE TODAY IS A 
NAVAJO FLUTIST, HIS NAME IS 
JONAH LITTLE. 
HE ALWAYS SPOKE FOR THE NATIVE 
AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND WE SAW 
NATIVE AMERICANS COMING OUT IN 
FORCE AT THE STATE CAPITOL 
YESTERDAY TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS 
FOR THAT VERY REASON. 
HE WAS ON THE INDIAN AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEE, AND SO THIS WAS 
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS REQUESTS 
THAT NATIVE AMERICAN VIEWS AND 
PERFORMANCES BE INCORPORATED 
INTO HIS MEMORIAL SERVICES THIS 
WEEK. 
SO THAT SHOULD BE PRETTY 
MEANINGFUL AS WELL. 
>> THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING. 
YOU KNOW, JUST SORT OF BRIEFLY 
FOR A MOMENT, THE VIDEO FEED 
THAT HAS BEEN SET UP INSIDE THE 
CHURCH WAS RUNNING, AND I THINK 
WE MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FLUTIST 
PLAYING, AND THEN SHORTLY AFTER 
THAT, A GENTLEMAN WITH 
BAGPIPES, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
STYLE OF MUSIC. 
>>REPORTER:  HE LOVED HIS 
BAGPIPES. 
>> HE DID. 
>>REPORTER:  HE LOVED HIS 
BAGPIPES. 
JOHN MCCAIN LOVED BAGPIPES. 
HE LOVED STANDARDS. 
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR "MY WAY" 
FROM FRANK SINATRA AT THE END 
OF THE MEMORIAL SERVICE TODAY 
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE A REPEAT 
PERFORMANCE OF THOSE BAGPIPES 
AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRA ON 
SATURDAY. 
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE MADE 
SURE WAS IN THIS PROGRAM. 
SO, YOU KNOW, FOR ANYONE WHO 
KNEW JOHN MCCAIN AND KNEW HIM 
WELL, THERE ARE GOING TO BE A 
LOT OF PERSONAL TOUCHES IN THIS 
CEREMONY. 
AND I THINK IN MANY WAYS IT'S 
GOING TO BE A LIGHTER CEREMONY 
THAN WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY, 
CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE TEARS 
AND THERE WILL BE TOUGH 
MOMENTS. 
BUT I SPOKE TO ONE OF HIS 
FRIENDS, GRANT WOODS WHO WAS 
THE FIRST CHIEF OF STAFF TO A 
VERY YOUNG CONGRESSMAN McGAIN 
BACK IN THE EARLY 1980s -- 
McCAIN BACK IN THE 1980s. 
HE WENT ON TO BE THE ARIZONA 
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE'S A 
LAWYER HERE IN PHOENIX, HE'S 
GOING TO BE SPEAKING TODAY. 
AND HE HAS HAD A LOT OF TIME TO 
THINK ABOUT WHAT HE WAS GOING 
TO SAY BECAUSE HE TOO WAS ASKED 
BACK IN MARCH IF HE WOULD BE 
WILLING TO SPEAK WHEN THE TIME 
CAME. 
AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THERE 
ARE SOME INAPPROPRIATE STORIES 
AND I'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND 
FORTH ABOUT WHETHER TO SHARE 
THEM AND I FINALLY FIGURED, 
HEY, THAT'S WHAT JOHN McCAIN 
WOULD WANT. 
HE WOULD WANT ME TO TELL THOSE 
STORIES. 
AND, SO, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING A LOT ABOUT JOHN McCAIN 
THE MILITARY HERO THIS WEEK, 
JOHN McCAIN THE SENATOR. 
BUT THERE'S ALSO JOHN McCAIN 
THE JOKESTER AND THE STRAIGHT 
TALKER. 
YOU HEARD LINDSEY GRAHAM THE 
OTHER DAY SAY THAT IF HE WAS 
JOHN McCAIN'S WINGMAN, HIS CODE 
NAME WAS LITTLE JERK, THAT'S 
WHAT McCAIN LIKED TO CALL HIM. 
SO THIS WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS 
SAR CASTIC AND HAD A GREAT 
SENSE OF HUMOR AND LOVED TO PUT 
OTHERS DOWN, PUT HIMSELF DOWN 
IN GEST, AND I THINK YOU'RE 
GOING TO GET A FLAVOR OF THAT 
TODAY AT THIS MEMORIAL SERVICE. 
>> AND, NANCY, I BELIEVE YOU 
SPOKE TO ONE OF HIS OTHER 
FRIENDS, YOU CAN CORRECTME IF 
I'M WRONG, TOMMY ESPINOZA, DID 
YOU SPEAK TO HIM AS WELL? 
>>REPORTER:  I DID SPEAK TO HIM 
AS WELL. 
ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS 
FORGED DECADES AGO, ANOTHER 
UNLIKELY FRIENDSHIP SOME WOULD 
SAY. 
HERE YOU HAD A YOUNG REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESSMAN AND A YOUNG LATINO 
ACTIVIST FROM A TIME BACK IN 
THE 1980s WHEN THE LATINO 
POPULATION WAS NOT AS LARGE AND 
INFLUENTIAL IN ARIZONA AS IT IS 
TODAY. 
SO AS ESPINOZA PUT IT IN OUR 
CONVERSATION, THERE REALLY 
WASN'T A HUGE UPSIDE FOR McCAIN 
BACK THEN TO BEFRIEND AN 
ACTIVIST IN THE LATINO 
COMMUNITY. 
BUT THEY JUST HAD A SIMILAR 
SENSIBILITY, THEY HAD SIMILAR 
INTERESTS IN MAKING SURE THAT 
THE LATINO COMMUNITY WAS WELL 
SERVED, AND SO THEY HIT IT OFF 
IN THE EARLY '80s, AND THEY DID 
COUNTLESS TOWN HALLS TOGETHER, 
THEY TRAVELED THE STATE 
TOGETHER. 
ESPINOZA TOLD ME THAT ONE OF 
THE REASONS THEY BECAME FRIENDS 
SO QUICKLY WAS THAT McCAIN 
ASKED HIM IF HE'D LIKE TO HAVE 
DINNER AND ESPINOZA SAID SURE, 
SURE. 
I'VE HEARD MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
SAY BEFORE THEY LIKE TO GET 
TOGETHER, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY 
HAPPEN. 
BUT IN THIS CASE THEY ACTUALLY 
SET A DATE. 
AND ESPINOZA SAID, OKAY, WHY 
DON'T YOU COME TO MY HOUSE FOR 
DINNER AND I'LL GRILL SOME 
STEAKS. 
RIGHT BEFORE HE SHOWED UP, 
ESPINOZA FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS 
HIS BIRTHDAY. 
AND McCAIN WAS KEEPING HIS 
PROMISE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS 
LEAVING A FAMILY CELEBRATION TO 
DO SO. 
SO ESPINOZA VERY QUICKLY RANG 
UP A MARIACHI BAND AND GOT THEM 
TO COME OVER TO HIS HOUSE SO 
THEY COULD SERENADE JOHN MCCAIN 
AND CINDY McCAIN AS THEY WALKED 
THROUGH THE DOOR AND SANG. 
AND McCAIN GOT SUCH A KICK OUT 
OF THAT AND HAD SUCH A GREAT 
TIME THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY 
CLEARLY -- THEY HIT IT OFF, 
THEY HAD THE SAME SENSE OF 
HUMOR AND THEY WERE VERY GOOD 
FRIENDS RIGHT UP UNTIL HIS 
DEATH. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT STORY. 
I SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A MUSICAL 
THEME. 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE NATIVE 
AMERICAN PERFORMER, THE 
BAGPIPES, THIS STORY, AND I WAS 
JUST TALKING TO DOUG WHEAT, HIS 
STORIAN, AND THE STORY THAT HE 
TOLD ME ABOUT McCAIN WAS HIM 
DANCING TO SORT OF MILITARY 
STANDARDS AND BEING CAUGHT UP 
IN A MILITARY BAND, AND IT 
REMINDED ME OF HOW MUCH THE 
MILITARY MEANT TO HIM. 
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TALK A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT? 
>>REPORTER:  OH, ABSOLUTELY. 
I MEAN, LOOK, HE COMES FROM A 
LONG LINE OF NAVY ADMIRALS, AS 
YOU KNOW. 
IT WAS SORT OF PREORDAINED THAT 
HE WAS GOING TO GO TO THE NAVAL 
ACADEMY HIMSELF. 
HE SEEMED TO STRUGGLE WITH THAT 
PERSONALLY AT FIRST, IT MIGHT 
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 
FACT THAT HE FINISHED, AS HE 
LOVED TO TELL EVERYONE, FIFTH 
FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS CLASS AT 
THE NAVAL ACADEMY, WORE THE 
BADGE OF HONOR FOR THE REST OF 
HIS LIFE, PROBABLY THOUGHT HE 
WAS THE BLACK SHEEP OF THE 
FAMILY, WASN'T GOING TO AMOUNT 
TO MUCH AT THAT POINT IN HIS 
LIFE, AND CERTAINLY HE PROVED 
HIMSELF WRONG ABOUT THAT. LY -
YOU KNOW, EVEN AFTER HE WAS 
RELEASED FROM IMPRISONMENT IN 
VIETNAM AND CAME BACK TO THE 
UNITED STATES, HE MAINTAINED A 
COMMITMENT TO THE MILITARY THAT 
LASTED HIS ENTIRE LIFE. 
HE WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE IN THE 
SENATE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
OF HIS LIFE. 
HE SERVED ON THE ARMED SERVICES 
COMMITTEE FOR DECADES. 
THE LAST DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 
ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED JUST A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WAS NAMED 
AFTER HIM. 
HE IS SOMEONE WHO FOUGHT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THE MILITARY HAD 
THE RESOURCES THAT IT NEEDED, 
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FIGHTING 
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WASN'T 
WASTING MONEY ON THINGS THAT IT 
DIDN'T NEED. 
HE'S SOMEONE WHO TRAVELED THE 
GLOBE NOT TO FANCY ANY EXCITING 
PLACES, BUT TO HOT SPOTS AND 
WAR ZONES AND AREAS WHERE 
PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING BECAUSE 
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS SOMEONE WHO 
WAS RECOGNIZABLE AROUND THE 
WORLD AS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM, 
AS A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY. 
AND EVEN IF THERE WASN'T 
SOMETHING THAT HE PERSONALLY 
COULD DO TO IMPROVE THE 
SITUATION, HE KNEW THAT GOING 
TO THESE PLACES GAVE PEOPLE 
HOPE AND GAVE THEM A SENSE THAT 
THE UNITED STATES HAD NOT 
FORGOTTEN ABOUT THEM. 
>> YEAH. 
NANCY, I JUST WANT TO REMIND 
EVERYBODY OF WHAT WE'RE 
WATCHIN RIGHT NOW. 
SENATOR McCAIN'S BODY HAS BEEN 
AT THE STATE CAPITOL BUILDING, 
BUT IT IS NOW ON ITS WAY TO THE 
NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH 
WHERE THERE WILL BE A CEREMONY 
IN A LITTLE -- PROBABLY IN 
MAYBE 20 MINUTES OR SO. 
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE 
MOTORCADE HERE ALONG WITH THE 
HEARSE CARRYING THE SENATOR'S 
BODY AS WELL FAMILY MEMBERS, 
FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS AT 
THE SERVICE TODAY, FORMER VICE 
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL BE 
SPEAKING, ALONG WITH A CLOSE 
FRIEND OF THE SENATOR TOMMY 
ESPINOZA AND LARRY FITZGERALD, 
ARIZONA CARDINALS PLAYER, ALSO 
A VERY CLOSE FRIEND. 
THERE ARE 24 SITTING SENATORS 
WHO WILL BE IN ATTENDANCE. 
THERE WILL BE FOUR FORMER 
SENATORS, 14 OF THEM -- OF THE 
SITTING SENATORS ARE 
REPUBLICANS, 10 ARE DEMOCRATS. 
SO EVEN IN HIS PASSING HE 
CONTINUES TO ENJOY BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT. 
SO YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I'M JUST GOING TO BE -- IN 
FACT, NANCY, I THINK I'M GOING 
TO STOP TALKING HERE AND LET'S 
JUST SORT OF DIP IN AND LISTEN 
AS THE HEARSE ARRIVES. 
  
>> THANK YOU.

THOUSAND YEARS BRIGHT SHINING 
AS THE SUN ♪ WE'LL HAVE NO 
LESS DAYS TO SING GOD'S PRAISE
♪ WHEN WE FIRST BE GONE ♪ 
>>>  CHAPTER 3 VERSUS 1 THROUGH 
2. TO EVERYTHING THERE IS A 
SEASON, A TIME TO EVERY PURPOSE 
UNDER THE HEAVEN, A TIME TO BE 
BORN AND A TIME TO DIE, A TIME 
TO PLANT AND A TIME TO PLUCK UP 
WHICH IS PLANTED. 
>> I WAS 28 YEARS OLD AND I'D 
ONLY BEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER AS 
A FEW YEARS OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, 
AND FOR SOME REASON JOHN McCAIN 
ASKED ME TO BE HIS CHIEF OF 
STAFF WHEN HE GOT ELECTED. 
SO ON MY FIRST DAY AT 7:00 A.M. 
JOHN MCCAIN PICKED ME UP AT MY 
HOUSE. 
I WENT TO THE CAR. 
I SAID, WELL, DO YOU WANT ME TO 
DRIVE. 
HE GOES, NO, NO, I'M GOING TO 
DRIVE. 
SO I SAID I'LL SIT IN THE BACK 
SEAT. 
 
>> I'M NO EXPERT ON THIS, BUT I 
THOUGHT THE STAFF DROVE. 
HE GOES, NO, GET IN THE CAR, 
BOY, GET IN THE CARMENT AND FOR 
THE NEXT HALF HOUR WE JUST 
TALKED ABOUT THE FOOTBALL GAMES 
THE DAY BEFORE AND WHATEVER WAS 
IN THE NEWS AND POLITICS AND 
TOLD A FEW JOKES. 
AND IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME 
JUST REALLY A LOT OF FUN AND 
ALSO QUITE TERRIFYING BECAUSE 
OF HIS RIDICULOUSLY BAD 
DRIVING. 
 
>> AS WE GET EXCITED HE WOULD 
KIND OF -- YOU KNOW, HE DROVE 
LIKE THIS ANYWAY, AND THEN HE 
WOULD GET EXCITED AND JUST 
START DRIFTING OFF. 
I'M, LIKE, HELLO OVER THERE. 
SO WE FINALLY GOT WHERE WE WERE 
GOING, AND I SAID, OH, HEY, BY 
THE WAY, WHAT ARE WE DOING? 
AND HE GOES, OH, I HIRED THE 
WHOLE STAFF AND I WANT YOU TO 
MEET THEM. 
>> I SAID, OH, OKAY, THAT'S 
GOOD. 
 
>> SO WE MET THE STAFF. 
AND THEN WE WENT BACK TO THE 
CAR. 
WE GOT IN THE THE CAR AND ALL 
THE STAFF CAME OUT AND THEY 
WERE ALL WAVING AND THINGS. 
I SAID THEY SEEM TO BE VERY 
NICE. 
HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
FIRE HALF OF THEM. 
 
>> I SAID WHAT? 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 
AND HE JUST SPED OFF, AND THE 
STAFF WAS WAVING. 
AND ABOUT ONE MINUTE LATER WE 
WENT RIGHT BACK BY BECAUSE HE'D 
GONE THE WRONG WAY OF COURSE, 
WAVED AGAIN. 
AND I JUST SAY THAT TWO HOURS 
KIND OF EPITOMIZED THE NEXT 35 
YEARS OF ME WITH JOHN MCCAIN. 
IT WAS ONCE A LITTLE BIT 
HARROWING, A LITTLE BIT WILD, A 
LITTLE BIT CRAZY BUT A LOT OF 
FUN AND THE GREATEST HONOR OF 
MY LIFE. 
I HAVE PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE 
TIME DID YOU EVER KNOW IN THOSE 
EARLY YEARS, DID YOU HAVE A 
FEELING YOU HAD SOMEONE SO 
SPECIAL THERE. 
AND MY ANSWER IS, YES, 
ABSOLUTELY. 
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 
AND I'LL TELL YOU THE FIRST 
TIME, IT WAS A DECEMBER, AND IT 
WAS OVER IN MY HOMETOWN OF 
MESA, ARIZONA. 
WE'RE AT A ROTARY CLUB, AND I 
THINK IT WAS ALL MEN AT THAT 
TIME. 
AND, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE TOUGH 
GUYS AND KIND OF CYNICAL ABOUT 
THINGS, AND HERE'S THIS NEW GUY 
IN TOWN. 
AND ONE OF THEM ASKED HIM SINCE 
IT WAS DECEMBER, HE ASKED HIM 
WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN PRISON? 
AND HE TOLD THEM A COUPLE OF 
STORIES. 
HE TOLD THEM ABOUT ONE NIGHT 
WHEN HE WAS BEING INTERROGATED 
FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND IT 
DIDN'T GO TOO WELL FOR HIS 
CAPTORS. 
THEY WERE UPSET WITH HIM. 
AND SO THEY TIED HIM UP AND 
THEY TIED THE ROPES TIGHT, AND 
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL AND THEY 
LEFT HIM THERE FOR THE NIGHT. 
AND SOME GUARD CAME IN WHO HE 
DID NOT KNOW AND NEVER HAD 
SPOKEN TO. 
AND AT 10:00 P.M. 
THE GUARD WALKED IN AND UNLOOSE 
HEENED THE ROPE -- UNLOOSENED 
THE ROPES. 
AND AT ABOUT 4:00 A.M. 
THE GUARD COME BACK AND 
TIGHTENED THEM UP AGAIN SO THAT 
HE WOULDN'T GET IN TROUBLE. 
AND JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHY THAT 
HAPPENED, BUT HE FOUND OUT A 
LITTLE CLUE A COUPLE WEEKS 
LATER RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
WHEN HE WAS STANDING IN THE 
DIRT YARD AND THAT GUARD JUST 
WALKED UP NEXT TO HIM. 
AND THE GUARD DIDN'T SAY A 
WORD, BUT WITH HIS SANDAL HE 
DREW A CROSS IN THE DIRT, AND 
THEY LOOKED AT IT FOR A MINUTE, 
AND THEN THE GUARD RUBBED IT 
OUT AND WENT ON HIS WAY. 
AND IT WAS QUIET IN THAT ROOM 
WHEN JOHN TOLD THAT. 
AND THEN HE SAID, YOU KNOW, ON 
CHRISTMAS EVE WE CELEBRATED, 
AND WE GOT TOGETHER UNDER THIS 
BARE LIGHT BULB AND WE SANG 
CHRISTMAS CAROLS, AND WE QUOTED 
BIBLE VERSES THAT WE COULD 
REMEMBER, AND WE TOLD THE 
GOSPEL STORY TO EACH OTHER. 
AND I GUESS JUST THAT IMAGE OF 
THIS BAND OF BROTHERS TOGETHER 
IN THIS GOD-FORSAKEN PLACE 
SINGING TO EACH OTHER, AND 
THERE AT THE FRONT OUR GUY, 
JOHN McCAIN BEATEN UP BUT NOT 
DOWN SINGING HIS FAVORITE 
CHRISTMAS CAROL "SILENT NIGHT" 
HOLY NIGHT, ALL IS CALM, ALL IS 
BRIGHT. 
ROUND YON VIRGIN, MOTHER AND 
CHILD, HOLY INFANT, SO TENDER 
AND MILD. 
THE WORDS SEEMED SO FAR AWAY 
FROM THAT PLACE, BUT THEY LEAN 
ON THE FAITH OF THEIR -- LEANED 
ON THE FAITH OF THEIR FATHERS 
AND THEIR FAITH IN EACH OTHER, 
AND THEIR FAITH IN THEIR 
COUNTRY AND THEIR FAITH IN GOD. 
I LOOKED OUT INTO THAT AUDIENCE 
THERE IN MY HOMETOWN, AND THOSE 
WERE SOME OF MY PEERS AND THE 
PEERS OF MY PARENTS. 
THOSE ARE TOUGH INDEPENDENT 
GUYS. 
THEY ARE RANCHERS AND FARMERS. 
THERE'S SOME COWBOYS, 
BUSINESSMEN, ENTREPRENEURS, AND 
THEY WERE CRYING BECAUSE THEY 
SAW IN JOHN McCAIN A LITTLE BIT 
OF WHAT THEY HOPED TO SEE IN 
THEMSELVES. 
THEY SAW IN JOHN McCAIN THE 
EMBODIMENT OF VALUES THAT THEY 
HOPED TO SEE FOR THEIR COUNTRY. 
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND 
YEARS JOHN GOT TO KNOW THIS 
PLACE, AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH 
ARIZONA. 
HE LOVED THE PEOPLE, OUR 
DIVERSITY, OUR NATIVE AMERICAN 
COMMUNITY, OUR HISPANIC CULTURE 
AND HE LOVED THE PLACE, IN 
PARTICULAR THE GRAND CANYON, 
THE COLORADO RIVER. 
WE FLOATED DOWN THAT TWICE 
TOGETHER, AND THEN HE KEPT 
GOING BACK AND BACK. 
HE LOVED IT. 
HE HIKED THE CANYON WITH JACK 
NOT THAT LONG AGO, RIM TO RIM. 
HE LOVED SEDONA. 
HE LOVED THIS PLACE. 
AND IF JOHN McCAIN FELL IN LOVE 
WITH ARIZONA, ARIZONA FELL IN 
LOVE WITH JOHN MCCAIN JOHN Mc. 
WE RAN A LOT OF RACES HERE, A 
LOT OF ELECTIONS. 
HE NEVER LOST, NEVER REALLY 
VERY CLOSE. 
ARIZONA LOVED HIM. 
WE HAD ONE LITTLE BLIP ONE TIME 
WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE THE 
FIRST TIME. 
HE CALLED ME ON THE PHONE. 
HE GOES, WELL, BOY, I THINK I 
MIGHT HAVE SCREWED UP. 
I GO WHY? 
HE SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS 
TALKING TO THESE STUDENTS AT U 
OF A, AND THEY SAID WHY ARE YOU 
THE ONLY POLITICIAN THAT COMES 
DOWN HERE? 
THEY ONLY GO TO THE RETIREMENT 
PLACES. 
HE SAYS, WELL, IT'S BECAUSE YOU 
GUYS DON'T VOTE. 
THOSE OTHER DUDES VOTE LIKE 
100%, YOU KNOW, SO YOU WANT 
PEOPLE TO COME DOWN HERE, YOU 
NEED TO VOTE LIKE THEY VOTE OUT 
AT SEIZURE WORLD. 
I SAID YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT, DID 
YOU? 
BECAUSE THERE'S THIS BIG 
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY CALLED 
LEISURE WORLD IN THE EAST 
VALLEY AND THEY WEREN'T REAL 
HAPPY WITH THEIR NEW NICKNAME 
OUT THERE. 
SO JOHN SAID, HE ALWAYS DOES, 
HE SAID, OKAY, I SCREWED UP, 
LET'S GO. 
WE GOTTA GO OUT THERE. 
WE. 
 
>> SO WE WENT OUT, AND I 
REMEMBER WE DROVE IN, AND THERE 
WAS ABOUT A 90-YEAR-OLD GUY IN 
A GOLF CART RIGHT THERE, AND HE 
WAS GIVING US THE FINGER. 
 
>> AND LITTLE DID HE KNOW WE 
BOTH SAID THAT'S GREAT. 
WE LOVED THAT. 
AND JOHN WAS, LIKE, HEY, GOOD 
TO SEE YOU. 
GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAL. 
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. 
SO HE WENT IN. 
HE SAID, OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT, 
AND WENT TO WORK. 
AND GUESS WHAT. 
I THINK HE WON THAT ABOUT 85/15 
IN THAT ELECTION IN THAT 
PRECINCT. 
SO WE'RE GOING TO MISS SO MANY 
THINGS ABOUT HIM HERE IN OUR 
STATE, HIS LEADERSHIP HERE ON 
THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. 
WE'RE GOING TO MISS HIS SENSE 
OF HUMOR. 
WE'RE GOING TO MISS HIS LOVE OF 
SPORTS. 
HE LOVED THE TEAMS, ALL OF OUR 
TEAMS. 
I MEAN BY LOVE THEM, I MEAN 
LOVE THEM, LIKE NONSTOP, OKAY? 
AND HE LOVED YOU GUYS, GONZO 
AND SHANE, HE REALLY DID. 
NOT A COINCIDENCE. 
HE DIDN'T BECOME FRIENDS JUST 
WITH THE BEST PLAYERS, BUT WITH 
THE BEST PEOPLE. 
AND HE LOVED YOU GUYS. 
BUT I THINK WE ALSO WORRIED 
HERE IN ARIZONA ABOUT A BIGGER 
PICTURE. 
AND I HOPE THAT WHAT HE STOOD 
FOR WILL MAYBE GET RENEWED LOOK 
IN OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD WANT. 
HE WOULD WANT US TO -- OKAY, WE 
RECOGNIZE HIM NOW, BUT NOW 
LET'S GET TO WORK. 
AND I'M SURE THE VICE PRESIDENT 
WILL TALK ABOUT JOHN AND 
BIPARTISANSHIP, BUT HE BELIEVED 
SO MUCH THAT THIS IN THE END, 
WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE, 
THIS REPUBLICAN/DEMOCRAT THING 
IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT, IS IT? 
WE'RE ALL AMERICAN, AND YOU 
GOTTA GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE 
CAN WORK TOGETHE AS AMERICANS. 
HIS SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY, I 
HOPE YOU MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
WILL KEEP THAT STRONG. 
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE HAD 
THEIR BACKS. 
AND ONE OTHER THING, JOHN 
MCCAIN BELIEVED IN OUR 
CONSTITUTION, AND HE STOOD UP 
FOR IT. 
HE FOUGHT FOR IT EVERY STEP OF 
THE WAY. 
SO HE WOULD NOT STAND BY AS 
PEOPLE TRIED TO TRAMPLE THE 
CONSTITUTION OR THE BILL OF 
RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
HE BELIEVED IN THE DECLARATION 
OF INDEPENDENCE. 
WHEN WE PROCLAIM TO THE WORLD 
THAT EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING 
IS IMPORTANT, EVERY SINGLE 
HUMAN BEING IS PRECIOUS, EVERY 
SINGLE PERSON IN THIS WORLD HAS 
THE RIGHT TO LIVE FREE, NOT 
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS SO, 
BUT BECAUSE GOD GAVE US THAT 
RIGHT. 
SO JOHN MCCAIN HIS ENTIRE LIFE 
STOOD BY THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS 
ACROSS THE WORLD. 
HE WAS THERE. 
HE WAS THERE FIGURATIVELY AND 
LITERALLY BY THEIR SIDE, 
WHEREVER THEY WERE, 
ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR RIGHT TO 
LIVE FREE. 
IT'S A LONG AND WINDING ROAD 
THAT TOOK HIM FROM THAT DIRT 
YARD IN HANOI TO THE DIRT BACK 
ROADS OF HIDDEN VALLEY. 
BUT THROUGH IT ALL HE WAS RES 
LEUTZ. 
HE WAS COURAGEOUS -- HE WAS 
RESOLUTE. 
HE WAS COURAGEOUS EVERY STEP OF 
THE WAY. 
AND IN ARIZONA HE WAS OUR HERO. 
I THINK YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS 
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT AND LOVE 
FOR JOHN MCCAIN THAT HE WAS 
AMERICA'S HERO. 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN FROM 
ARIZONA, HE SERVED HIS COUNTRY 
WITH HONOR. 
HE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT. 
HE FINISHED THE RACE. 
HE KEPT THE FAITH. 
NOW, MY FRIEND, WE CAN FINISH 
THE SONG. 
SLEEP IN HEAVENLY PEACE. 
SLEEP IN HEAVENLY PEACE. 
AMEN. 
 
>> WELL, I HAD THE GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY OF MEETING 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN McCAIN IN 
WASHINGTON, SEE HOW IT WAS BACK 
THERE VISITING, AND HE SAID YOU 
NEED TO MEET THIS CONGRESSMAN, 
THIS YOUNG MAVERICK, FULL OF 
ENERGY. 
AND I SAID, OH, YEAH? 
HE SAID, BESIDES THAT, HE'S 
GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES ONE DAY AND 
HE SAYS YOU NEED TO MEET HIM. 
I SAID OKAY. 
SO WE MET IN VIRGINIA AT -- MY 
APOLOGIES. 
IT WAS ROUGH GETTING UP HERE. 
ALEXANDRIA. 
CINDY AND CEEAI AND MYSELF, WE 
HAD DINNER IN THIS NICE LITTLE 
RESTAURANT, AND WE CHATTED FOR 
A WHILE, AND THEN ALL OF A 
SUDDEN WITH JOHN MCCAIN, HE 
JUST BOND. 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIS 
ENERGY LEVEL THAT GOES UP, HE 
STARTS TALKING, STARTS ASKING 
ME ABOUT MY BACKGROUND. 
OF COURSE NOT KNOWING HIM THAT 
WELL, ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS. 
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE FELT 
VERY COMFORTABLE WITH EACH 
OTHER GOING BACK AND FORTH. 
SO THEN I GOT ENOUGH NERVE TO 
ASK HIM, I SAID, CONGRESSMAN, 
WHAT WAS IT THAT ALLOWED YOU TO 
BE IN A PRISONER OF WAR CAMP, I 
MEAN, WHAT KEPT YOU TOGETHER? 
AND HE SAID, WELL, HE GOES, YOU 
KNOW, MOST PEOPLE ASKED ME HOW 
THEY TREATED ME, OBVIOUSLY THEY 
TREATED ME PRETTY BAD. 
HE GOES, BUT -- HE SAID ONE IS 
MY FAITH IN GOD, MY LOVE FOR MY 
FAMILY, AND MY FAITH IN MY 
COUNTRY. 
HE SAID THOSE THINGS KEPT ME 
TOGETHER. 
SO WE KEPT TALKING THAT 
EVENING. 
AND AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
DISCUSSION AND FOR THIS TALK, I 
WANTED TO REFLECT WITH YOU A 
READING FROM CORINTHIANS 13 
WHICH I THINK CAPTURES SENATOR 
JOHN McCAIN. 
CORINTHIANS 13, THOUGH I SHOULD 
GIVE AWAY TO THE POOR ALL THAT 
I POSSESS AND EVEN GIVE UP MY 
BODY TO BE BURNED, IF I AM 
WITHOUT LOVE, IT WILL DO ME NO 
GOOD WHATEVER. 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AN 
INDIVIDUAL LIKE SENATOR McCAIN 
WHO SUFFERED, WHO WAS 
IMPRISONED, WAS INJURED, AND 
YET WITH ALL THAT WAS ABLE TO 
KEEP HIS FAITH TOGETHER, HIS 
FOCUS ON HIS COUNTRY, FOCUS ON 
HIS FAMILY, I BELIEVE THAT THAT 
PERIOD OF TIME THOSE FIVE YEARS 
IS WHERE GOD MOLDED THIS 
FANTASTIC HERO, FOR GOD TOOK AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO HUMBLE THIS 
YOUNG MAN WHO CAME FROM A 
MILITARY FAMILY, GOD USED THOSE 
MINUTES, THOSE HOURS, THOSE 
DAYS, THOSE YEARS TO PUT 
TOGETHER A HUMAN BEING THAT 
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE 
SENATOR FOR GENERATIONS. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS A PERSON WHO 
LOVED WITH HIS ENERGY, WHO 
LOVED ALL OF US, WHO LOVED HIS 
COUNTRY. 
THAT EVENING WHILE WE WERE 
HAVING DINNER, HE SAID WHEN WE 
GET BACK TO PHOENIX, WE NEED TO 
GET TOGETHER AND HAVE DINNER. 
AND OF COURSE BACK THEN I WAS 
PRETTY COCKY, SO I SAID, WELL, 
CONGRESSMAN, I KNOW A NUMBER OF 
CONGRESSMEN AND I KNOW A COUPLE 
SENATORS, AND, YOU KNOW, WE 
ALWAYS HEAR THAT. 
HE SAYS, WELL, NO, WHEN YOU GET 
BACK, YOU GIVE ME A DATE AND 
I'LL BE THERE. 
I SAID, WELL, I WANT TO INVITE 
YOU TO MY HOUSE, US MEXICAN-
AMERICANS LOVE TO COOK, AND WE 
LOVE TO HAVE FOLKS AT OUR HOMES 
IF YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO BE A 
FRIEND. 
AND HE CHUCKLED. 
SO A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER 
WHEN I GOT BACK HOME WE CALLED, 
SET UP A DINNER AT THE HOUSE, 
AND OF COURSE I WAS PREPARING 
TORTILLAS AND OTHER STUFF YOU 
ALL KNOW ABOUT AND MY HOMEMADE 
SALSA, AND I GET A CALL FROM 
HIS OFFICE AND THEY SAY HE'S 
RUNNING LATE. 
SO I ASKED WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? 
THEY SAID, WELL, IT'S HIS 
BIRTHDAY, HE WANTED TO SPEND A 
BIT OF TIME WITH HIS FAMILY. 
SORRY, CINDY. 
AND OF COURSE I PANIC AND SAY, 
YOU KNOW, IF HE WANTS TO 
CANCEL, I UNDERSTAND. 
PLEASE. 
HE SAID, NO, HE MADE IT VERY 
CLEAR TO US HE'S GOING TO YOUR 
HOUSE TONIGHT TO HAVE DINNER. 
SO I SCRAMBLED AND GOT A 
MARIACHI GROUP. 
 
>> I FIGURED I GOTTA DO 
SOMETHING REALLY GOOD. 
MEXICAN FOOD IS NOT GOING TO 
GET ME THERE. 
AND LUCKILY THEY GOT THERE 
ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE HE 
ARRIVED. 
SO WHEN CINDY AND THE 
CONGRESSMAN THEN WALKED INTO MY 
HOUSE, THE KITCHEN, THE 
MARIACHI STARTED PLAYING. 
THEY SING A TRADITIONAL MEXICAN 
BIRTHDAY SONG IN OUR CULTURE, 
AND OF COURSE JOHN AND CINDY 
LIT UP, AND IT WAS A GREAT 
EVENING. 
AND WE ENJOYED THE NIGHT. 
THAT'S SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. 
HE KEEPS HIS WORD. 
THAT'S THE SENATOR THAT WE'VE 
HAD ALL THESE YEARS THAT 
SOMETIMES WE BEAT UP ON. 
THAT'S THE SENATOR THAT I HOPE 
PEOPLE CAN EMBRACE WHAT HE 
STOOD FOR FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
AND, YES, HE WAS A MAVERICK. 
IN HIS FIRST SENATORIAL 
CAMPAIGN I GET A CALL AND IT'S 
HIM ON THE PHONE WITH FATHER 
TONY, A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE, 
AND THEY SAY YOU HAVE THE 
CONGRESSMAN ON THE PHONE. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TRACKED ME 
DOWN, BUT WE'RE IN A 
RESTAURANT. 
SO I GET THE PHONE, AND HE 
SAYS, TOMMY, I'M RUNNING FOR 
THE U.S. SENATE, BLAH, BLAH, 
BLAH, YOU KNOW, JOHN, HE WAS 
GOING 100 MILES AN HOUR. 
SO I'M GOING, LIKE, OKAY. 
HE SAYS I WANT YOU TO CO-CHAIR 
MY CAMPAIGN. 
I SAID, WELL, JOHN, YOU KNOW 
I'M A DEMOCRAT. 
 
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S GOING TO 
HELP YOU WITH YOUR REPUBLICAN 
CAMPAIGN. 
HE SAYS, I DON'T KNOW CARE, 
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, I WANT YOU TO 
CO-CHAIR. 
I SAID, WELL, LET ME SLEEP ON 
IT. 
NO, NO. 
YOU GIVE ME AN ANSWER RIGHT 
NOW, YES OR NO. 
AND OF COURSE I SAID YES. 
ONCE AGAIN SENATOR JOHN McCAIN 
GOES OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. 
AND DON'T FORGET, I WAS LIKE AN
ACTIVE BACK THEN, WE WERE KNOCK 
-- NOT THE MOST LIBERAL 
ORGANIZATION -- OR THE MOST 
CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATION IN 
THE COUNTRY. 
AND WE'D GO BACK AND FORTH 
WITH, JOHN, YOU EITHER WERE A 
FRIEND, BUT AT THE END OF THE 
DAY WE COULD GO A COUPLE OF 
YEARS WITHOUT SEEING EACH 
OTHER, BUT WHEN WE DID IT WAS 
LIKE OLD HOME WEEK. 
HE WAS WARM, IT WAS ENERGY, HE 
WAS GOING 100 MILES AN HOUR, 
BUT YET HE MADE TIME TO BE WITH 
YOU. 
AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GET 
A CALL MY WIFE AND I TO COME TO 
LAS VEGAS. 
THIS OF COURSE IS WHEN HE'S IN 
HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AND 
WE END UP IN LAS VEGAS WITH HIS 
TWO RIGHT HAND FOLKS THAT HAVE 
ALWAYS RUN HIS CAMPAIGNS WHICH 
I HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT 
FOR. 
SO WE DO THE QUICK CHITCHAT, 
AND THEN JOHN SAYS I WANT YOU 
TO SPEAK ON MY BEHALF AT THE 
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. [ 
LAUGHTER  ] 
>> I SAID, SENATOR, I WANT TO 
REMIND YOU I'M A DEMOCRAT. 
 
>> I DON'T CARE. 
I WANT YOU THERE. 
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, I WANT YOU 
THERE. 
I SAID, YES, I'LL BE THERE. 
HE SAID, WELL, HE SAYS, WITH A 
BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE, WATCH 
OUT WHEN YOU START YOUR CAR. 
 
>> I SAID, OKAY, SENATOR. 
I'LL DO THAT. 
SO JOHN KIND OF PUT ME OUT ON 
THE NATIONAL SCENE, AND I MUST 
CONFESS HE DID A NUMBER OF 
THINGS THAT I COULD STAND HERE 
ALL DAY AND SHARE WITH YOU 
DIFFERENT STORIES. 
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT ONE 
TIME WHEN WE MET IS WHEN MEGHAN 
WAS ON THE TV PROGRAM, AND I 
DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAME OF 
THE TV PROGRAM, MEGHAN, BUT HE 
SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW MEGHAN IS 
ON TV NOW AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. 
I GO OKAY. 
DO YOU SEE HER? 
NO, SENATOR, I DON'T WATCH TV 
THAT MUCH. 
WELL, YOU START WATCHING HER. 
 
>> OKAY. 
SO THAT WAS OUR GREAT SENATOR. 
AS WE WERE WALK OUT, HE ASKED 
MY WIFE, HE SAYS, VEDA, I GOT A 
QUESTION FOR YOU, IF I PUT A 
WOMAN ON OUR TICKET AS VICE 
PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ABOUT THAT? 
WELL, MY WIFE ISN'T THE TYPE 
THAT HOLDS BACK. 
SHE'S A MEXICAN FROM MEXICO 
CITY, AND THEY HAVE A TENDENCY 
OF JUST TELLING YOU HOW IT IS 
AND OF COURSE THE SENATOR LIKED 
THAT. 
SO SHE TURNS, AND SHE SAYS, 
WELL, I REALLY DON'T CARE IF 
IT'S A MAN OR A WOMAN. 
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU, I 
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PERSON 
CAN RUN THE COUNTRY. 
SO JOHN LOOKED AT HER AND SAYS 
OKAY. 
HE LOOKED AT HER, IT'S TWO 
GUYS, AND OF COURSE WE WALKED 
OUT. 
NEEDLESS TO SAY LATER WE HEARD 
WHO HE HAD ELECTED. 
REGARDLESS, THERE WAS THE 
SENATOR AGAIN TAKING THE RISK 
OF PUTTING FORTH A WOMAN FOR 
VICE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT 
COUNTRY OF OURS. 
SO IT'S OF NO SURPRISE. 
IT'S OF NO SURPRISE ALSO THAT 
HE GOT TOGETHER WITH KENNEDY TO 
PUSH FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM 
BECAUSE WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION, IT WASN'T SO MUCH 
THE POLITIC OF IT. 
HE WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE FAMILIES 
THAT COME FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY, 
FROM MEXICO, FROM CENTRAL 
AMERICA TO WORK CUTTING OUR 
GRASS, FEEDING US, BRINGING IN 
THE LABOR FORCE THAT WE NEED 
AND NOW WE TURN ON THEM? 
THAT REALLY STRUCK AT THE HEART 
OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OUR GREAT 
COUNTRY WAS ABOUT. 
I BELIEVE IT COST HIM A 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. 
SO TO ME IT'S VERY DEAR WHAT 
THE SENATOR IS ABOUT. 
TO ME JOHN REALLY DID REFLECT 
OUR COUNTRY IN ITS TRUE FORM. 
MY FATHER IS A MARINE, PASSED 
AWAY IN FEBRUARY. 
ONCE A MARINE, ALWAYS A MARINE 
HE'D SAY. 
GOT WOUNDED IN GUAM, PURPLE 
HEART. 
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN, HE SAID HE UNDERSTANDS 
US. 
HE UNDERSTANDS US. 
AND I MUST CONFESS HE DID 
UNDERSTAND US. 
HE UNDERSTOOD ALL OF US WHETHER 
IT WAS WHITE, BLACK, BROWN, 
ASIAN. 
TO HIM IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE. 
WHAT HE KNEW IS THAT WE ALL 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 
WE ALL MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 
SO I HOPE THAT IN HIS LEGACY 
THE SENATORS, GOVERNORS, 
MAYORS, CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, 
ELECTED OFFICIALS EMBRACE THE 
THOUGHT OF LOVE BECAUSE JOHN 
REFLECTED LOVE AND LOVE OF A 
STRONG MAN, AND THAT IS 
NOWADAYS HARD TO COME BY. 
SO HIS LEGACY WILL GO ON FOR 
GENERATIONS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL 
TALK ABOUT SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN 
AS ONE OF THE GREATEST HEROS IN 
OUR LIFETIME. 
AND WITH THAT, IF YOU PERMIT 
ME, READ TIMOTHY II. 
AS FOR ME, MY LIFE IS ALREADY 
BEING POURED AWAY AS A LIVATION 
AND THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO 
DEPART. 
I HAVE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT TO 
THE END. 
I HAVE RUN THE RACE TO THE 
FINISH. 
I HAVE KEPT THE FAITH. 
MY DEAR FRIEND GRACIAS.

>> I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY 
COUNTRY WHEN I WAS A PRISONER 
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S. 
SENATOR McCAIN SPOKE THESE 
HEARTFELT WORDS AS HE ACCEPTED 
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR 
PRESIDENT IN 2008. 
THEY WERE THE WORDS OF AN 
AUTHENTIC AMERICAN HERO. 
WE ALL KNOW HOW THE STORY GOES, 
A FIRED NAVY PILOT SHOT DOWN BY 
THE NORTH VIETNAMESE NEAR A 
LAKE IN HANOI. 
AS HIS PLANE HAS GONE TO 
CONTROL, HE BAILED OUT JUST IN 
TIME TO PLUNGE INTO THE LAKE 
BELOW. 
THAT PILOT, A YOUNG GENTLEMAN 
CAME, WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE AS A 
PRISONER OF WAR WHERE HE SPENT 
MORE THAN 5 1/2 YEARS, ALMOST 
2,000 DAYS HE WOULD ENDURE 
COUNTLESS BEATINGS, TORTURE, 
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND MENTAL 
AND EMOTIONAL ANGUISH THAT NONE 
OF US WILL EVER HAVE TO ENDURE. 
AFTER GETTING TO KNOW SENATOR 
McCABE, I FELT COMPELLED TO 
VISIT VIETNAM. 
I WANTED TO SEE THE PLACES 
WHERE THE WILL OF JOHN MCCAIN 
WAS TESTED AND FORGED. 
I SAW THE LAKE. 
I WALKED THE STEPS. 
I SAT IN THE CELL, AND THE 
ORDEAL THAT MY FRIEND SURVIVED 
BECAME ALL THE MORE REAL. 
MANY PEOPLE MIGHT WONDER WHAT A 
YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN KID FROM 
MINNESOTA AND A HIGHLY 
DECORATED VIETNAM WAR HERO 
TURNED UNITED STATES SENATOR 
MIGHT HAVE IN COMMON. 
WELL, I THOUGHT OF A FEW. 
I'M BLACK, HE WAS WHITE. 
 I'M YOUNG, HE 
WASN'T SO YOUNG. 
 
>> HE LIVED WITH PHYSICAL 
LIMITATIONS BROUGHT ON BY WAR. 
I'M A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE. 
HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT, I RUN OUT 
OF BOUNDS. 
 
>> HE WAS THE EPITOME OF 
TOUGHNESS, AND I DO EVERYTHING 
I CAN TO AVOID CONTACT. 
I HAVE FLOWING LOCKS, AND, 
WELL, HE DIDN'T. 
 
>> HOW DOES THIS UNLIKELY PAIR 
BECOME FRIENDS? 
I'VE ASKED MYSELF THIS SAME 
QUESTION. 
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER 
IS? 
THAT'S JUST WHO HE IS. 
OVER THE SEVERAL YEARS I HAD 
THE PRIVILEGE OF SPENDING TIME 
WITH SENATOR McCAIN, SOMETIMES 
IT WAS JUST A VISIT TO OUR 
PRACTICES, OTHER TIMES IT WAS 
HIM TEXTING AND SAYING YOU NEED 
TO PICK IT UP THIS SUNDAY. 
 I'M THANKFUL THAT 
THROUGH THESE MOMENTS THE 
OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD TO 
SHARE OUR LIVES AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY OUR STORIES WHILE 
FROM VERY DIFFERENT WORLDS WE 
DEVELOPED A MEANINGFUL 
FRIENDSHIP. 
AND THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE VERY 
RARE AND VERY SPECIAL QUALITIES 
OF SENATOR McCAIN THAT I CAME 
TO DEEPLY ADMIRE. 
HE DIDN'T JUDGE INDIVIDUALS 
BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR 
SKIN, THEIR GENDER, THEIR 
BACKGROUNDS, THEIR POLITICAL 
AFFILIATIONS OR THEIR BANK 
ACCOUNTS. 
HE EVALUATED THEM ON THE MERITS 
OF THEIR CHARACTER AND THE 
COUNTENANCE OF THEIR HEARTS. 
HE JUDGED THEM ON THE WORK THEY 
PUT IN AND THE PRINCIPLES THEY 
LIVED BY. 
IT WAS THIS APPROACH TO 
HUMANITY THAT MADE SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN SO RESPECTED BY 
COUNTLESS PEOPLE AROUND THE 
WORLD, INCLUDING ME. 
HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE MANY, 
U.S. SENATOR, PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE, STATESMAN, WARRIOR 
AND HERO. 
HIS WORK ETHIC TIRELESS. 
HIS FIGHT LEGENDARY. 
BUT WHAT MADE SENATOR McCAIN SO 
SPECIAL WAS THAT HE CARED ABOUT 
THE SUBSTANCE OF MY HEART, MORE 
SO THAN WHERE I CAME FROM. 
WHILE SOME MIGHT FIND OUR 
FRIENDSHIP OUT OF THE ORDINARY, 
IT WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF 
WHAT MADE HIM AN ICONIC FIGURE 
OF AMERICAN POLITICS AND 
SERVICE TO FELLOW MAN. 
HE CELEBRATED DIFFERENCES. 
HE EMBRACED HUMANITY, 
CHAMPIONED WHAT WAS TRUE AND 
JUST AND SAW PEOPLE FOR WHO 
THEY WERE. 
YES, OURS WAS AN UNLIKELY 
FRIENDSHIP, BUT IT'S ONE THAT I 
WILL ALWAYS CHERISH. 
I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF ATTENDING 
SEVERAL OF THE SEDONA FORUMS 
HOSTED BY SENATOR McCAIN AND 
HIS REMARKABLE WIFE CINDY. 
THERE WERE WORLD LEADERS IN 
POLITICS, BUSINESS, SCIENCE AND 
EDUCATION TO DISCUSS THE MOST 
PRESSING MATTERS OF OUR TIME, 
ISSUES LIKE HEALTHCARE, GLOBAL 
WARMING, TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING. 
THESE LEADERS GATHERED TO FIND 
REAL SOLUTIONS, AND THEY 
GATHERED BECAUSE SENATOR McCAIN 
ASKED THEM TO BE THERE. 
HIS DEVOTION TO MAKING ARIZONA 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE WHOLE 
WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR 
EVERYONE HAS INSPIRED COUNTLESS 
LEADERS, LIKE THOSE AT THE 
SEDONA FORUMS. 
I'M CONFIDENT HIS LEGACY OF 
DEVOTION AND TO THE COMMON GOOD 
WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE 
AROUND THE WORLD LONG AFTER 
TODAY. 
A FEW YEARS AGO HE WAS KIND 
ENOUGH TO TAKE ME ON A PERM 
TOUR OF THE U.S. -- PERSONAL 
TOUR OF THE U.S. SENATE. 
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SENATOR 
McCAIN WAS HIGHLY REGARDED. 
HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT AND WAS 
GOOD REGARDLESS OF WHICH 
POLITICAL SIDE OF THE AISLE HIS 
OPINION FELL ON. 
I SAW HOW RESPECTED HE WAS AND 
HOW MUCH ADMIRATION HE 
COMMANDED FROM PEOPLE FROM 
ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. 
BUT THAT ADMIRATION WASN'T 
SURPRISING BECAUSE SENATOR 
McCAIN WAS KNOWN AS A MAN OF 
INTEGRITY AND CONVICTION, A MAN 
WHO AT TIMES JUST AS HE 
SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR HIS 
FELLOW POWs IN VIETNAM 
WILLINGLY CHOSE TO SACRIFICE 
HIS OWN POLITICAL GAINS IN 
ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE 
BELIEVED WAS BEST FOR ALL. 
AS A RESULT OF THIS TYPE OF 
SACRIFICE, HE MAY HAVE LOST THE 
SUPPORT OF A POLITICAL ALLY 
HERE AND THERE, BUT HE GAINED 
THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF 
AN ENTIRE NATION. 
IN CLOSING, I'D LIKE TO HONOR 
THE LOVE I SAW IN SENATOR 
McCAIN. 
HE LOVED THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA, 
SERVING THEM PASSIONATELY AND 
DILIGENTLY FOR DECADES. 
HE TOOK THAT SAME LOVE TO 
WASHINGTON AND BOLDLY ADVOCATED 
FOR FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES HE 
HAD GROWN TO LOVE AS A YOUNG 
NAVY PILOT. 
BUT THE LOVE I SAW MOST WAS THE 
LOVE HE HAD FOR HIS WIFE CINDY 
AND HIS CHILDREN. 
I HEARD HIM SPEAK ABOUT THEM 
OFTEN AND THE LOVE ALWAYS CAME 
POURING THROUGH IN EVERY WORD. 
SENATOR McCAIN, IT'S BEEN A 
TRUE HONOR TO CALL YOU FRIEND. 
YOUR TOUGHNESS AND BRAVERY 
INSPIRED US, YOUR SACRIFICE AND 
RISK OUR LIVES. 
YOUR DEVOTION TO THE PEOPLE OF 
ARIZONA, OUR NATION AND YOUR 
CONVICTIONS WON OUR ADMIRATION. 
YOUR LOVE SET AN EXAMPLE FOR 
ALL OF US TO FOLLOW. 
JACKIE ROBINSON ONCE SAID THAT 
LIFE IS NOT IMPORTANT EXCEPT IN 
THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON OTHER 
LIVES. 
SENATOR McCAIN, WE WILL MISS 
THE BLESSINGS OF BEING IN YOUR 
PRESENCE, BUT WE WILL NEVER 
FORGET THE IMPACT YOU HAD ON 
THE WORLD, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY 
ON EACH OF THE LIVES THAT YOU 
TOUCHED. 
WE ARE ALL BETTER FOR HAVING 
KNOWN YOU. 
REST IN PEACE, MY FRIEND. 
 
>>> MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. 
 
>> I'M A DEMOCRAT. 
 AND I LOVED JOHN 
McCAIN. 
I HAVE HAD THE DUBIOUS HONOR 
OVER THE YEARS OF GIVING SOME 
EULOGIES FOR FINE WOMEN AND MEN 
THAT I'VE ADMIRED, BUT, 
LINDSEY, THIS ONE IS HARD. 
THE THREE MEN WHO SPOKE BEFORE 
ME I THINK CAPTURED JOHN, 
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF JOHN IN A 
WAY THAT ONLY SOMEONE CLOSE TO 
HIM COULD UNDERSTAND. 
BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, THE 
WAY I THOUGHT ABOUT IT WAS I 
ALWAYS THOUGHT OF JOHN AS A 
BROTHER, WE HAD A HELL OF A LOT 
OF FAMILY FIGHTS. 
WE GO BACK A LONG WAY. 
I WAS A YOUNG UNITED STATES 
SENATOR. 
I GT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29, 
AND I HAD THE DUBIOUS 
DISTINCTION OF BEING PUT ON THE 
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE 
WHICH THE NEXT YOUNGEST PERSON 
WAS 14 YEARS OLDER THAN ME. 
AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME 
TRAVELING THE WORLD BECAUSE I 
WAS ASSIGNED A RESPONSIBILITY 
MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE 
KNOW, I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE 
EUROPEAN AFFAIRS SUBCOMMITTEE, 
SO I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON 
NATO AND THEN THE SOVIET UNION. 
AND ALONG CAME A GUY A COUPLE 
YEARS LATER, A GUY I KNEW OF, 
ADMIRED FROM AFAR, YOUR HUSBAND 
WHO HAD BEEN A PRISONER OF WAR, 
WHO HAD ENDURED ENORMOUS, 
ENORMOUS PAIN AND SUFFERING AND 
DEMONSTRATED THE CODE, THE 
McCAIN CODE. 
PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT 
MUCH TODAY, BUT IMAGINE HAVING 
ALREADY KNOWN THE PAIN YOU WERE 
LIKELY TO ENDURE AND BEING 
OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO 
HOME BUT SAY NO. 
AS THE SON CAN TELL YOU IN THE 
NAVY, THE LAST ONE IN, THE LAST 
ONE OUT. 
SO I KNEW OF JOHN. 
AND JOHN BECAME THE NAVY 
LIAISON OFFICER IN THE UNITED 
STATES SENATE. 
THERE WAS AN OFFICE -- THEN IT 
USED TO BE ON THE BASEMENT 
FLOOR OF MEMBERS OF THE 
MILITARY WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO 
SENATORS WHEN THEY TRAVEL 
ABROAD TO MEET WITH HEADS OF 
STATE OR OTHER FOREIGN 
DIGNITARIES. 
AND JOHN HAD BEEN RECENTLY 
RELEASED FROM THE HANOI HILTON, 
A GENUINE HERO AND BECAME THE 
NAVY LIAISON. 
FOR SOME REASON WE HIT IT OFF 
FROM THE BEGINNING. 
WE WERE BOTH FULL OF DREAMS AND 
AMBITIONS. 
AND AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO 
MAKE THE TIME WE HAD THERE 
WORTHWHILE, TO DO THE RIGHT 
THING, TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE 
COULD MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR 
THE COUNTRY WE LOVED SO MUCH. 
AND JOHN AND I ENDED UP 
TRAVELING EVERY TIME I WENT 
ANYWHERE, I TOOK JOHN WITH ME 
OR JOHN TOOK ME WITH HIM, AND 
WE WERE IN CHINA, JAPAN, 
RUSSIA, GERMANY, FRANCE, 
ENGLAND, TURKEY, ALL OVER THE 
WORLD, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
MILES, AND WE WOULD SIT ON THAT 
PLANE, AND LATE IN THE NIGHT 
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS ASLEEP 
AND JUST TALK, GETTING TO KNOW 
ONE ANOTHER. 
WE'D TALK ABOUT FAMILY. 
WE'D TALK ABOUT POLITICS. 
WE'D TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS. 
WE'D TALK ABOUT PROMISE, THE 
PROMISE OF AMERICA BECAUSE WE 
BOTH ARE COCKEYED OPTIMISTS AND 
REALLY BELIEVE THERE'S NOT A 
SINGLE THING BEYOND THE 
CAPACITY OF THIS COUNTRY, I 
MEAN, FOR REAL, NOT A SINGLE 
THING, AND WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW 
ANOTHER WOMAN OR MAN, YOU GET 
TO KNOW THEIR HOPES AND THEIR 
FEARS, YOU GET TO KNOW THEIR 
FAMILY EVEN BEFORE YOU MEET 
THEM, YOU GET TO KNOW HOW THEY 
FEEL ABOUT REALLY IMPORTANT -- 
WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING 
EXCEPT CAPTIVITY AND THE LOSS 
OF MY FAMILY WHICH HAD JUST 
OCCURRED, MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER, 
ONLY TWO THINGS WE DIDN'T TALK 
ABOUT. 
BUT I FOUND THAT IT WASN'T TOO 
LONG INTO JOHN'S DUTIES THAT 
JILL AND I GOT MARRIED, AND 
JILL IS WITH ME HERE TODAY. 
FIVE YEARS I HAD BEEN A SINGLE 
DAD, AND NO MAN DESERVES ONE 
GREAT LOVE, LET ALONE TWO, AND 
I MET JILL. 
CHANGED MY LIFE. 
AND SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM 
AND HE WITH HER. 
HE'D ALWAYS CALL HER, AS 
LINDSEY WOULD LATER TRAVEL WITH 
US, CALL HER JILLY. 
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN 
THEY'D GET BORED BEING WITH ME 
ON THESE TRIPS, I REMEMBER 
GOING TO SEE GREECE AND I SAID 
WHY DON'T I JUST TAKE YOU ALL 
TO DINNER. 
I LATER LEARNED THEY'RE DOWN IN 
A CAFE AT THE PORT, AND HE HAS 
HER DANCING ON TOP OF A CEMENT 
TABLE DRINKING NEWZO. 
NOT A JOKE. 
JILLY. 
RIGHT, JILLY? 
SO -- BUT WE GOT TO KNOW EACH 
OTHER WELL AND HE LOVED MY SON 
BEAU AND MY SON HUNT. 
AS A YOUNG MAN, HE CAME UP TO 
MY HOUSE, HE'D COME UP TO 
WILMINGTON, AND OUT OF THIS 
GREW A GREAT FRIENDSHIP THAT 
TRANSCENDED WHATEVER POLITICAL 
DIFFERENCES WE HAD OR LATER 
DEVELOPED BECAUSE ABOVE ALL, 
ABOVE ALL WE UNDERSTOOD THE 
SAME THING, ALL POLITICS IS 
PERSONAL. 
IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUST. 
I TRUSTED JOHN WITH MY LIFE, 
AND I WOULD, AND I THINK HE 
WOULD TRUST ME WITH HIS. 
WE BOTH KNEW THEN FROM OUR 
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES THAT -- 
AND AS I PROGRESSED WE LEARNED 
EVEN MORE, THAT THERE ARE TIMES 
WHEN LIFE CAN BE SO CRUEL, PAIN 
SO BLINDING IT'S HARD TO SEE 
ANYTHING ELSE. 
THE DISEASE THAT TOOK JOHN'S 
LIFE TOOK OUR MUTUAL FRIEND 
TEDDY'S LIFE, THE EXACT SAME 
DISEASE NINE YEARS AGO A COUPLE 
DAYS AGO, AND THREE YEARS AGO 
IT TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL SON BEAU'S 
LIFE. 
IT'S BRUTAL. 
IT'S RELENTLESS, IT'S 
UNFORGIVING. 
AND IT TAKES SO MUCH FROM THOSE 
WE LOVE AND FROM THE FAMILIES 
WHO LOVE THEM THAT IN ORDER TO 
SURVIVE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW 
THEY LIVED, NOT HOW THEY DIED. 
I CARRY -- I CARRY WITH ME AN 
IMAGE OF BEAU SITTING OUT IN A 
LITTLE LAKE WE LIVE ON, 
STARTING TO MOTOR ON AN OLD 
BOAT AND SMILING AND WAVING, 
NOT THE LAST DAYS. 
I'M SURE VICKI KENNEDY HAS HER 
OWN IMAGE, MAYBE LOOKING, 
SEEING TEDDY LOOKING SO ALIVE 
ON A SAILBOAT OUT ON THE CAPE. 
AND FOR THE FAMILY, FOR THE 
FAMILY YOU WILL ALL FIND YOUR 
OWN IMAGES, WHETHER IT'S 
REMEMBERING HIS SMILE OR HIS 
LAUGH OR A TOUCH ON THE 
SHOULDER, OR JUST RUNNING HIS 
HAND DOWN YOUR CHEEK, OR HIS 
FEELING LIKE SOMEONE IS LOOKING 
AT AND TURNING AND SEEING HIM 
JUST SMILING AT YOU, JUST 
LOOKING AT YOU. 
OR WHEN YOU SAW THE SHEER JOY 
THAT CROSSED HIS FACE THE 
MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT 
TO GET UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR 
AND START A FIGHT. 
GOD, HE LOVED IT. 
 
>> SO TO CINDY AND TO THE KIDS, 
DOUG, ANDY, CINDY, MEGHAN, 
JIMMY, JACK, BRIDGET, AND I 
KNOW SHE'S NOT HERE, BUT TO 
MRS. McCAIN, WE KNOW HOW 
DIFFICULT IT IS TO BURY A 
CHILD, MRS. McCAIN. 
MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU. 
AND I KNOW RIGHT NOW THE PAIN 
YOU ALL ARE FEELING IS SO 
SHARP, SO HOLLOWING. 
AND JOHN'S ABSENCE IS ALL 
CONSUMING FOR ALL OF YOU RIGHT 
NOW. 
IT'S LIKE BEING SUCKED INTO A 
BLACK HOLE INSIDE YOUR CHEST, 
AND IT'S FRIGHTENING. 
BUT I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE, 
UNFORTUNATELY, FROM EXPERIENCE 
THAT THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN 
SAY OR DO TO EASE THE PAIN 
RIGHT NOW. 
BUT I PRAY, I PRAY YOU TAKE 
SOME COMFORT KNOWING THAT 
BECAUSE YOU SHARED JOHN WITH 
ALL OF US YOUR WHOLE LIFE THE 
WORLD NOW SHARES WITH YOU THE 
ACHE OF JOHN'S DEATH. 
LOOK AROUND THIS MAGNIFICENT 
CHURCH. 
LOOK WHAT YOU SAW COMING AT THE 
STATE CAPITOL YESTERDAY. 
IT'S HARD TO STAND THERE. 
BUT PART OF -- PART OF IT WAS 
-- AT LEAST IT WAS WITH ME FOR 
BEAU STANDING IN THE STATE 
CAPITOL, YOU KNEW, IT WAS 
GENUINE, IT WAS DEEP. 
HE TOUCHED SO MANY LIVES. 
AND I'VE GOTTEN CALLS NOT JUST 
BECAUSE PEOPLE KNEW WE WERE 
FRIENDS, NOT JUST FROM PEOPLE 
AROUND THE COUNTRY, BUT LEADERS 
AROUND THE WORLD CALLING ME. 
I'M GETTING ALL THESE SYMPATHY 
LETTERS, I MEAN, HUNDREDS OF 
THEM AND TWEETS. 
CHARACTER IS DESTINY. 
JOHN HAD CHARACTER. 
WHILE OTHERS WILL MISS HIS 
LEADERSHIP AND HIS PASSION, 
EVEN HIS STUBBORNNESS, YOU'RE 
GOING TO MISS THAT HAND ON YOUR 
SHOULDER. 
THE FAMILY, YOU'RE GOING TO 
MISS THE MAN, AS FAITHFUL A MAN 
HE WAS WHO YOU KNEW LITERALLY, 
NOT FIGURATIVELY LIVED HIS LIFE 
FOR YOU. 
AND FOR THAT THERE'S NO BOMB 
BUT TIME. 
TIME AND YOUR MEMORIES OF A 
LIFE LIVED WELL AND LIVED 
FULLY. 
BUT I MAKE YOU A PROMISE. 
I PROMISE YOU THE TIME WILL 
COME BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN IS SIX MONTHS WILL GO BY 
AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO 
THINK, WELL, IT'S PAST, BUT 
YOU'RE GOING TO RIDE BY THAT 
FIELD OR SMELL THAT FRAGRANCE, 
RECEIVE THAT FLASHING IMAGE, 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE 
YOU DID THE DAY YOU GOT THE 
NEWS. 
BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO 
MAKE IT WHEN THE IMAGE OF YOUR 
DAD, YOUR HUSBAND, YOUR FRIEND 
CROSSES YOUR MIND AND A SMILE 
COMES TO YOUR LIP BEFORE A TEAR 
TO YOUR EYE, THAT'S WHEN YOU 
KNOW. 
AND I PROMISE YOU, I GIVE YOU 
MY WORD, I PROMISE YOU, THIS I 
KNOW, THAT DAY WILL COME, THAT 
DAY WILL COME. 
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE MY FORMER 
COLLEAGUES AND ALL WHO WORKED 
WITH JOHN, I'M SURE THERE'S 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID TO YOU NOT 
ONLY NOW BUT THE LAST 10 YEARS, 
EXPLAIN THIS GUY TO ME. 
 
>> RIGHT? 
EXPLAIN THIS GUY TO ME. 
BECAUSE AS THEY LOOKED AT HIM, 
IN ONE SENSE THEY ADMIRED HIM, 
BUT IN ONE SENSE -- IN THE WAY 
THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH IN 
AMERICA, THEY LOOK AT HIM AS IF 
JOHN CAME FROM ANOTHER AGE THAT 
LIVED BY A DIFFERENT CODE, AN 
ANCIENT, ANTIQUATED CODE WHERE 
HONOR, COURAGE, CHARACTER, 
INTEGRITY, DUTY BECAUSE THAT 
WAS OBVIOUS HOW JOHN LIVED 
. 
>>> EVERYTHING HE WAS. 
YOU COME TO A DIFFERENT 
CONCLUSION. 
HE WOULD PART COMPANY WITH YOU 
IF YOU LACKED THE BASIC VALUES 
OF DECENCY, RESPECT. 
KNOWINGTHIS THAT THIS PROJECT 
IS BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. 
JOHN'SSTORY IS THE AMERICAN 
STORY. 
THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. 
IT'S THE AMERICAN STORY. 
GROUNDED IN RESPECT AND D, 
CENCY, BASIC FAIRNESS, THE 
INTOLERANCE FOR THE ABUSE OF 
POWER. 
MANY OF YOU HAVE TRAVELED THE 
WORLD, LOOK HOW THE REST OF THE 
WORLD LOOKS AT US. 
THEY LOOK AT US A LITTLE NAIVE. 
WE ARE SO FAIR AND DECENT. 
WE ARE THE NAIVE AMERICANS. 
THAT'S WHO WE ARE. 
THAT'S WHO JOHN WAS. 
HE COULD NOT STAND THE ABUSE OF 
POWER WHEREVER HE SAW IT ; IN 
WHATEVER FORM, IN WHATEVER 
COUNTRY. 
ALWAYS ABOUT BASIC VALUES, 
JOHN, FAIRNESS, HONESTY, 
DIGNITY, RESPECT, GIVING HATE 
NO SAFE HARBOR. 
LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND AND 
UNDERSTANDING AS AMERICANS WE 
ARE PART OF SOMETHING MUCH 
BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. 
WITH JOHN IT WAS A VALUE SET 
THAT WAS NEITHER SELFISH NOR 
SELFSERVING. 
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT AMERICA WAS 
FIRST AND FOREMOST AN IDEA. 
RISKY, ORGANIZED AROUND NOT 
TRIBE BUT AROUND IDEALS. 
THINK OF HOW HE APPROACHED 
EVERY ISSUE. 
THE IDEALS THAT AMERICANS HAVE 
RALLY ADD ROUND FOR OVER200 
YEARS HAS PREPARED YOU. 
AN IDEA IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
SOUNDS CORNY. 
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS 
SELFEVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE 
CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR 
YETOR WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS. 
TO JOHN THOSE WORDS HAD MEANING 
AS THEY HAVE FOR EVERY GREAT 
PATRIOT THAT HAS EVER SERVED 
THIS COUNTRY. 
WE BOTH LOVED THE SENATE. 
PROUDEST YEARS OF MY LIFE FOR 
BEING A UNITED STATES SENATOR. 
I WAS HONORED TO BE VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
BEING A UNITED STATES STATES 
SENATOR AND WE BOTH LAMENTED 
WATCHING IT CHANGE. 
DURING LONG DEBATES IN THE 80'S 
AND 90s SOME OF THE COLLEAGUE 
AROUND THEN WOULD KNOW I WOULD 
GO OVER AND SIT NEXT TO JOHN. 
NEXT TO HIS SEAT. 
HE WOULD COME OVER ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND SIT NEXT TO 
ME. 
NOT JOKING. 
WE WOULD SIT THERE AND TALK TO 
EACH OTHER. 
I CAN REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN I 
CAME OUT TO SEE JOHN. 
WE TALKED ABOUT IT. 
WE WERE ABOUT  -- ALL THE 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HAVE LUNCH 
AND ALL THE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS. 
WE BOTH WENT IN OUR CAUCUS AND 
WE WERE APPROACHED BY OUR 
LEADERS WITH THE SAME THING. 
IT RAISED THE DISCUSSION. 
JOE IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, YOU 
SITTING NEXT TO JOHN ALL THE 
TIME. 
I SWEAR TO GOD. 
SAME THING WAS SAID TO JOHN. 
THAT IS WHEN THINGS STARTED TO 
CHANGE FOR THE WORST IN AMERICA 
IN THE SENATE. 
THAT'S WHEN IT CHANGED. 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THOSE 
TIMES, IT WAS ALWAYS 
APPROPRIATE TO CHALLENGE 
ANOTHER SENATOR'S JUDGEMENT BUT 
NOT THEIR MOTIVE. 
WHEN YOU CHALLENGE THEIR MOTIVE 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TO GO. 
IF I SAY YOU ARE DOING THIS 
BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING PAID OFF, 
IF I SAY YOU ARE DOING THIS 
BECAUSE ARE YOU NOT A GOOD 
CHRISTIAN F I SAY YOU ARE DOING 
THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE THIS THAT 
OR THE OTHER THING IT'S 
IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH CONSENSUS. 
THINK ABOUT IN YOUR PERSONAL 
LIVES. 
ALL WE DO TODAY IS A TACK THE 
OPPOSITIONS OF BOTH PARTIES. 
THEIR MOTIVES. 
NOT THE SUBSTANCE OF THEIR 
ARGUMENT. 
THIS IS THE MID90'S. 
WILL IT BEGIN TO GO DOWNHILL 
FROM THERE? 
THE LAST DAY JOHN WAS ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR WHAT WAS HE 
FIGHTING TO DO? 
HE WAS FIGHTING TO RESTORE  
WHATWE CALL REGULAR ORDER, TO 
START TO TREAT ONE ANOTHER 
AGAIN LIKE WE USED TO. 
SENATE WAS NEVER PERFECT, JOHN, 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
WE WERE THERE A LONG TIME 
TOGETHER. 
I WOULD WATCH TEDDY KENNEDY AND 
JAMES EASTLAND FIGHT LIKE HELL 
ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND THEN GO 
HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER. 
JOHN WANTED TO SEE REGULAR 
ORDER WRIT LARGE, GET TO KNOW 
ONE ANOTHER. 
YOU KNOW JOHN AND I WERE BOTH 
AMU SED WHERE WE GOT TWO AWARDS 
THE LAST YEAR I WAS VICE 
PRESIDENT AND THEN ONE 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER FOR OUR 
DIGNITY AND RESPECT WE SHOWED 
TO ONE ANOTHER. 
WE RECEIVED AN AWARD FOR 
CILIVITY IN PUBLIC LIFE. 
IT WAS A COLLEGE THAT PUTS OUT 
THIS AWARD EVERY YEAR FOR 
BIPARTISAN. 
WE SAID WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? 
NOT A JOKE. 
I SAID TO SENATOR FLAKE THAT'S 
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. 
YOU ARE GETTING AN AWARD? 
I'M SERIOUS. 
THINK ABOUT THIS. 
GETTING AN AWARD FOR YOUR 
CIVILITY. 
GETTING AN AWARD FOR BEING 
BIPARTISAN. 
CLASSIC JOHN, ONE AT ALLEGANY 
COLLEGE, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
THERE AND WE GOT THE AWARD AND 
JOHN -- THE SENATE WAS IN 
SESSION AND HE SPOKE FIRST. 
AS HE WALKED OFF THE STAGE AND 
I WALKED ON HE LOOKED AT ME AND 
SAID JOE, DON'T TAKE IT 
PERSONALLY BUT I JUST DON'T 
WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE HELL YOU 
HAVE TO SAY AND HE LEFT. 
ONE OF HIS MAJOR CAMPAIGN 
PEOPLE IS NOW WITH THE SENATE, 
WITH THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO WAS 
ON THIS MORNING AND I HAPPENED 
TO WATCH IT. 
HE SAID THAT BIDEN AND McCAIN 
HAD THIS STRANGE RELATIONSHIP. 
THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE EACH 
OTHER'S BACK. 
WHEN I WAS IN TROUBLE JOHN WAS 
THE FIRST GUY THERE. 
I HOPE I WAS THERE FOR HIM. 
WE NEVER HESITATED TO GIVE EACH 
OTHER ADVICE. 
HE CALLED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF 
CAMPAIGN AND SAID WHAT THE HELL 
DID YOU SAY THAT FOR? 
WASN'T ON AN ISSUE, LIKE YOU 
JUST SCREWED UP, JOE. 
I WOULD SOMETIMES CALL HIM. 
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN THINKING THIS 
WEEK ABOUT WHY JOHN'S DEATH HAS 
HIT THE COUNTRY SO HARD. 
YES, HE WAS A LONG SERVING 
SENATOR WITH A REMARKABLE 
RECORD. 
YES, HE WAS A TWO TIME 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO 
CAPTURED THE SUPPORT AND 
IMAGINATION OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
YES, JOHN WAS A WAR HERO AND 
DEMONSTRATED EXTRAORDINARY 
COURAGE I THINK OF JOHN AND MY 
SON WHEN I THINK OF INGORSOLL'S 
WORDS, WHEN DUTY THROWS A 
GAUNTLET DOWN TO FATE. 
WHEN HONOR SCORNS TO COMPROMISE 
WITH DEATH, THAT IS HEROISM. 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT ABOUT 
JOHN. 
I DON'T THINK IT FULLY EXPLAINS 
WHY THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SO 
TAKEN BY JOHN'S PASSING. 
I THINK ITS SOMETHING MORE 
INTANG IB LE. 
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNEW 
JOHN BELIEVED SO DEEPLY AND 
WITH SO MUCH PASSION IN THE 
SOUL OF AMERICA THAT HE MADE IT 
EASIER FOR THEM TO HAVE 
CONFIDENCE AND FAITH IN 
AMERICA. 
HIS FAITH IN THE CORE VALUES OF 
THIS NATION MADE THEM SOMEHOW 
FEEL IT MORE THEMSELVES. 
HIS CONVICTION THAT WE AS A 
COUNTRY WOULD NEVER WALK AWAY 
FROM THE SACRIFICES GENERATIONS 
OF AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO 
DEFEND LIBERTY AND FREEDOM AND 
HUMAN DIGNITY AROUND THE WORLD. 
IT MADE AVERAGE AMERICANS PROUD 
OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR 
COUNTRY. 
HIS BELIEF AND IT WAS DEEP THAT 
AMERICANS CAN DO ANYTHING ; 
WITH STAND ANYTHING, ACHIEVE 
ANYTHING. 
IT WAS BOTH UNFLAGGING AND 
REASSURING THAT THIS MAN 
BELIEVED THAT SO STRONGLY. 
HIS CAPACITY THAT WE ARE THE 
WORLD'S LAST BEST HOPE. 
THAT WE ARE THE BEACON TO THE 
WORLD, THAT THERE ARE 
PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS GREATER 
THAN OURSELVES AND WE ARE 
SUFFERING, SACRIFICING FOR AND 
IF NECESSARY DYING FOR. 
AMERICANS SAW HOW HE LIVED HIS 
LIFE THAT WAY. 
THEY KNEW THE TRUTH OF WHAT HE 
WAS SAYING. 
I JUST THINK HE GAVE AMERICANS 
CONFIDENCE. 
JOHN WAS A HERO. 
HIS CHARACTER, COURAGE, HONOR, 
INTEGRITY. 
I THINK THE THINGS UNDERSTATED 
THE MOST IS HIS OPTIMISM. 
THAT'S WHAT MADE JOHN SPECIAL. 
MADE JOHN A GIANT AMONG ALL OF 
US. 
IN MY VIEW JOHN DIDN'T BELIEVE 
THAT AMERICA'S FUTURE AND FATE 
RESTED ON HEROS. 
WE USED TO TALK AND KNOW MOST 
ABOUT HIM, WHAT HE UNDERSTOOD 
WHAT I HOPE WE ALL REMEMBER. 
HEROS DIDN'T BUILD THIS 
COUNTRY. 
ORDINARY PEOPLE BEING GIVEN 
HALF A CHANCE ARE CAPABLE OF 
DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. 
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. 
JOHN KNEW ORDINARY AMERICANS 
KNEW THAT EACH OF US HAD A DUTY 
TO DEFEND THE BIRTH RIGHT OF 
EVERY CHILD THEY CARRIED. 
THAT GOOD COMMUNITIES ARE BUILT 
BY THOUSANDS OF SMALL ACTS OF 
DECENCY, THAT AMERICA AS I 
SPEAK TODAY SHOWS EACH OTHER 
EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT BURIED 
DEEP IN THE DNA OF THIS 
NATION'S SOUL LIES THE FLAME 
THAT WAS LIT OVER 200 YEARS 
AGO. 
THAT EACH OF US CARRY WAS US 
AND EACH US HAS THE CAPACITY, 
THE RESPONSIBILITY AND WE CAN 
SCREW UP THE COURAGE TO ENSURE 
IT'S NOT PUT OUT AND IT'S A 
THOUSAND LITTLE THINGS THAT 
MAKE US DIFFERENT. 
THE BOTTOM LINE WAS I THINK 
JOHN BELIEVED IN US. 
I THINK HE BELIEVED IN THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
NOT JUST ALL THE PREAMBLES. 
HE BELIEVED IN THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
ALL 325 MILLION OF US. 
EVEN THOUGH JOHN IS NO LONGER 
WITH US HE LEFT US PRETTY CLEAR 
INSTRUCTIONS. 
QUOTE, BELIEVE ALWAYS IN THE 
PROMISE AND GREATNESS OF 
AMERICA BECAUSE NOTHING IS 
INEVITABLE HERE. 
CLOSE TO THE LAST THING JOHN 
SAID TOOK THE WHOLE NATION AS 
HE KNEW HE WAS ABOUT TO DEPART. 
THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED AMERICA 
TO UNDERSTAND. 
NOT TO BUILD HIS LEGACY. 
HE WANTED AMERICAN TO REMIND 
AND TO UNDERSTAND. 
I THINK JOHN'S LEGACY WILL 
CONTINUE TO INSPIRE AND 
CHALLENGE GENERATIONS OF 
LEADERS AS THEY STEP FORWARD 
AND JOHN McCAIN'S IMPACT ON 
AMERICA IS NOT OVER. 
IT'S NOT OVER. 
I TONIGHT THINK IT'S EVEN 
CLOSE. 
CINDY, JOHN OWED SO MUCH OF 
WHAT HE WAS TO YOU. 
YOU WERE HIS BALLAST. 
WHEN I WAS WITH YOU BOTH I 
COULD JUST SEE HOW HE LOOKED AT 
YOU. 
JILL IS THE ONE WHEN WE WERE IN 
HAWAII AND HE FIRST MET YOU 
THERE. 
HE KEPT LOOKING AT YOU AND JILL 
SAID GO UP AND TALK TO HER. 
YOU MAY NOT HAVE HAD YOUR 
FATHER AS LONG AS YOU WOULD 
HAVE LIKED BUT YOU GOT FROM HIM 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO PURSUE 
YOUR OWN DREAMS. 
TO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF YOUR 
OWN SPIRIT. 
YOU ARE A LIVING LEGACY. 
YOU ARE A LIVING LEGACY AND 
PROOF OF JOHN McCAIN'S  
SUCCESS. 
NOW JOHN WILL TAKE HIS RIGHTFUL 
PLACE IN THE LONG LINE OF 
EXTRAORDINARY LEADERS IN THIS 
NATION'S HISTORY WHO IN THEIR 
TIME AND IN THEIR WAY STOOD FOR 
FREEDOM AND LIBERTY AND HAVE 
MADE THE AMERICAN STORY THE 
MOST HOPEFUL AND MOST ENDURING 
STORY ON EARTH. 
I KNOW JOHN SAID HE HOPED HE 
PLAYED A SMALL PART IN THAT 
STORY. 
JOHN, YOU DID MUCH MORE THAN 
THAT MY FRIEND.
WE SHALL NOT SEE HIS LIKE 
AGAIN.

BREAD HAS TO BE BROKEN TO BE 
SHARED. 
WE ARE CELEBRATING TODAY THE 
LIFE OF A MAN WHOBROKEN THAT WE 
MAY BE ONE AGAIN. 
JOHN McCAIN, OUR BROTHER, 
JESUS'S BROTHER. 
TO REMEMBER, TO BRING TOGETHER 
JOHN McCAIN I INVITE YOU TO 
SHARE THE WORDS OF HENRY SCOTT 
HOLLA ND. 
LAUGH AS WE ALWAYS LAUGHED AT 
JOKES WE ENJOYED TOGETHER. 
PLAY, SMILE, THINK OF ME, PRAY 
FOR ME. 
LET MY NAME BE EVER THAT 
HOUSEHOLD WORD THAT IT ALWAYS 
WAS. 
LET IT BE SPOKEN WITHOUT 
AFFECT, WITHOUT A TRACE OF 
SHADOW ON IT.
WE PRAY, LORD GOD, MAY JOHN 
McCAIN'S VISION BE IN OUR  
EYES. 
HIS VOICE IN OUR WORDS AND OUR 
TONGUE. 
HIS LISTENING TO THE NEEDS OF 
OTHERS IN OUR EARS. 
HIS LOVE FOR HIS COUNTRY IN OUR 
HEARTS.
BLESS YOU JOHN McCAIN IN THE 
NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON AND 
THE HOLY SPIRIT.

>>> AS WE COME TO A CLOSE, I 
WOULD LIKE TO READ SOME WORDS 
THAT WERE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN 
BY HIS DAUGHTER MEGAN. 
MY FATHER IS GONE AND I MISS 
HIM AS ONLY AN ADORING DAUGHTER 
CAN. 
IN THIS LOSS AND IN THIS SORROW 
I TAKE COMFORT IN THIS, JOHN 
McCAIN, HERO OF THE REPUB LIC 
AND TO HIS LITTLE GIRL WAKES 
TODAY TO SOMETHING MORE 
GLORIOUS THAN ANYTHING ON THIS 
EARTH. 
TODAY THE WARRIOR ENTERS HIS 
TRUE AND ETERNAL LIFE, GREETED 
BY THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE 
HIM AND SHE WRITES, RISING TO 
MEET THE AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS. 
WE WILL GRIEVE, WE WILL MOURN 
BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT 
HER WORDS. 
IN THIS VERY MOMENT SENATOR 
JOHN McCAIN IS IN HEAVEN WITH 
GOD THE FATHER AND JESUS THE 
SON. 
NO MORE CANCER, NO MORE PAIN, 
NO MORE SICKNESS, NO MORE 
BURDENS OF THIS WORLD. 
IN FACT HIS BIGGEST CONCERN IS 
PROBABLY WHAT CHANNEL DO I HAVE 
TO FIND IN HEAVEN IN ORDER TO 
WATCH LARRY PLAY ON SUNDAYS? 
ALL JOKING ASIDE HE IS A 
FREEMAN AND HE IS MORA LIVE 
THAN HE HAS EVER BEEN. 
SEE SENATOR McCAIN PROFESSED CH 
RISTIANITY AND HERE IS THE HOPE 
HE BELIEVED. 
HE KNEW ROMANS3, 23, FOR ALL 
HAVE SINNED AND FALLEN SHORT OF 
THE GLORY OF GOD. 
HE KNEW ROMANS6-23, THAT THE 
WAGES OF SIN WAS DEATH BUT THE 
GIFT OF GOD WAS ETERNAL LIFE 
THROUGH HIS SON JESUS CHRIST. 
THE HOPE THAT WE HAVE IS THE 
GOOD NEWS THAT SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN BELIEVED THIS PASSAGE 
FROM JOHN 316. 
THAT FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD 
THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN 
SON, THAT WHO BELIEVES IN HIM 
SHALL NOT PERISH BUT HAVE 
EVERLASTING LIFE. 
WHEN WE GRIEVE AND WHEN WE 
MOURN UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS 
ETERNAL LIFE AND HE IS WITH THE 
FATHER IN HEAVEN BECAUSE OF HIS 
FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST. 
THAT IS SOMETHING TO FIND 
COMFORT IN. 
THAT IS THE REASON WHY MEGAN 
CAN WRITE THESE WORDS SO  
BEAUTIFULLY. 
LET US PRAY TOGETHER. 
FATHER AS WE LEAVE FROM THIS 
PLACE WE ASK YOU TO GIVE 
COMFORT TO CINDY AND THE FAMILY 
AS VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 
SAID THERE WILL BE DAYS THAT 
THE FRESHNESS OF THIS LOSS HITS 
THEM HARD, FATHER. 
IN THOSE MOMENTS LORD WHEN THEY 
FIND THEMSELVES BY THEMSELVES 
MOURNING THIS DEEP PAIN AND 
SORROW WILL YOU COMFORT THEM, 
GOD? 
WILL YOU GIVE THEM THE STRENGTH 
THEY NEED TO WALK EVERY SINGLE 
DAY? 
AND GOD AS WE MOURN AS YOUR 
WORD SAYS WE MORN DIFFERENTLY 
BECAUSE SENATOR McCAIN BELIEVED 
YOU SENT YOUR ONLY SON TO WALK 
THIS EARTH AND LIVE A SINLESS 
LIFE. 
TO DIE ON THE CROSS FOR OUR 
SINS, FOR THE THINGS WE  
DESERVED. 
HE BELIEVED THAT JESUS CHRIST 
WAS PUT INTO THE TOMB AND HE 
ROSE AGAIN. 
HE DEFEATED DEATH. 
THAT IS THE REASON TO CELEBRATE 
AND THAT IS THE REASON FOR US 
TO HAVE COMFORT. 
IT'S IN JESUS NAME WE PRAY,  
AMEN. 
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL BEGIN ON 
BEHALF OF THE McCAIN FAMILY FOR 
BEING HERE AND SUPPORTING THEM. 
AT THIS MOMENT WE WILL ASK YOU 
TO STAY SEATED UNTIL THE ENTIRE 
FAMILY HAS EXITED THE BUILDING. 
. ♪  ♪
I LOVE, THE END IS NEAR, SO I 
TAKE THE FINAL CURTAIN. 
MY FRIENDS I WILL SAY ADIEU, I 
WILL STATE MY CASE OF WHICH I'M 
CERTAIN. 
I LIVE AID LIFE THAT'S FULL I 
TRAVELED EACH AND EVERY 
HIGHWAY. 
AND FOR MUCH MORE THAN THIS I 
DID IT MY WAY. 
REGRETS I'VE HAD A FEW. 
BUT THEN AGAIN TOO FEW TO 
MENTION. 
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO AND SAW 
IT THROUGH WITHOUT EXEMPTION. 
I PLANNED EACH JOG AND COURSE, 
EACH CAREFUL STEP ALONG THE 
BIWAYS. 
MORE U MMORE THAN THIS, I DID 
IT MY WAY. 
YES, THERE WERE TIMES I'M SURE 
YOU KNEW WHEN I BIT OFF MORE 
THAN I COULD CHEW. 
BUT THROUGH IT ALL, WHEN THERE 
WAS DOUBT I ENDED UP AND SPIT 
IT OUT. 
I FACED IT ALL AND I STOOD TALL 
AND DID IT MY WAY. 
I'VE LOVED, I'VE LAUGHED AND 
CRIED. 
I'VE HAD MY FILL, MY SHARE OF 
LOSING. 
AND NOW, AS TEARS SUBSIDE, I 
FIND IT ALL SO AMUSING TO THINK 
I DID ALL THAT AND MAY I SAY. 
>>  CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE 
FITTING END TO THIS MEMORIAL 
SERVICE IN ARIZONA AT THE NORTH 
PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH. 
WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING INTO 
ABOUT A 90 MINUTE SERVICE BY 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY HONORING THE 
LATE SENATOR AND HIS LIFE. 
IT WAS A CEREMONY WITH TEARS 
AND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF 
LAUGHTER AND LOVING MEMORIES. 
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN NANCY 
CORD IS WHO IS JUST OUTSIDE THE 
PHOENIX AREA. 
BOY WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY. 
I HAVE TO SAY. 
I THINK IT WAS THE LAST TIME WE 
HONORED THE LIFE OF MOHAMMED 
ALI. 
A FUNERAL THAT WAS SO EMBRACING 
SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE. 
STRUCK ALSO BY JOE BIDEN'S 
REMARKS. 
>>  YEAH. 
I THINK SOMETHING THAT YOU 
HEARD FROM BIDEN AND REALLY 
EVERY PERSON WHO SPOKE IN THIS 
REMARKABLE MEMORIAL SERVICE WAS 
THE FACT THAT THEY STRUCK WITH 
-- WHAT MAY HAVE SEEMED AT THE 
BEGINNING LIKE AN UNLIKELY 
FRIENDSHIP WITH JOHN McCAIN, 
JOE BIDEN A BIG DEMOCRAT, JOHN 
McCAIN WAS REPUBLICAN. 
LARRY FITZGERALD STAR ATHLETE 
TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS BLACK 
AND JOHN McCAIN WAS WHITE. 
HE WAS YOUNG, JOHN McCAIN WAS 
OLD. 
TOMMY ESPINOZA TALKED ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT McCAIN REPEATEDLY 
ASKED HIM TO STAND BY HIM, 
ASKED HIM TO CO CHAIR HIS 
SENATE CAMPAIGN, ASKED HIM TO 
SPEAK FOR HIM AT THE GOP 
PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTION AND 
EACH TIME HE SAID TO HIM YOU 
KNOW I'M A DEMOCRAT RIGHT? 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A 
PROBLEM? 
YET, THEY ALL STRUCK THESE 
FRIENDSHIPS WITH HIM AND RIGHT 
NOW BEHIND ME AS YOU CAN SEE 
THE CASKET IS BEING BROUGHT OUT 
TO THE HEARSE BY THE HONOR 
GUARD. 
THEY SAID THAT THEY STRUCK UP 
THESE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE 
WHILE POLITICS WAS IMPORTANT TO 
HIM, CHARACTER AND VALUES AND 
FUN WERE MORE IMPORTANT. 
YOU KNOW JUST REMARKABLE TO 
HEAR FROM THESE MEN AND WOMEN 
WHO HAD THESE VERY, VERY CLOSE 
FRIENDSHIPS WITH HIM FOR 
DECADES. 
>>  WE ARE SEEING NOW BRIDGETT 
AND THE CHILDREN OF JOHN McCAIN 
ENTERING. 
YOU HAVE INTERVIEWED. 
TELL US WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU. 
>>  FIRST OF ALL HOW ACCESSIBLE 
HE WAS TO US WHICH IS ALWAYS 
SOMETHING REPORTERS LOVE. 
HE NEVER --  YOU KNOW SHIED 
AWAY FROM US. 
ALWAYS STOPPED TO TALK EVEN IF 
IT WAS JUST FOR A MOMENT. 
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST TO CRACK A 
JOKE. 
HE WANTED US TO KNOW HOW HE 
FELT ABOUT A VARIETY OF ISSUES. 
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MORE HE 
TALKED ABOUT HIS POINT OF VIEW 
AND SOMETIME ITSELF WAS A VERY 
LONELY POINT OF VIEW IN HIS 
PARTY, THE MORE HE SPOKE TO US 
THE EASY TERRACE FOR HIM TO GET 
HIS MESSAGE OUT THERE. 
EVEN WHEN HE GOT SICK AND HE 
CLEARLY COULDN'T SPEAK AS WELL 
AS HE HAD BEFORE, AT ONE POINT 
HE WAS BOUND TO A WHEELCHAIR. 
HE HAD SURGERY. 
YOU COULD TELL HE WAS IN PAIN. 
HE STILL STOPPED AND WOULD JOKE 
AND SAY I'M LIVING THE DREAM. 
I'M LIVING THE DREAM AND GO ON. 
HE HAD A LOT OF AFFECTION FOR 
REPORTERS AND YOU COULD -- PART 
OF THE REASON AS YOU HEARD JOE 
BIDEN DESCRIBE SO WELL IN HIS 
SPEECH IS THAT -- IS THAT JOHN 
McCAIN HATED ABUSE OF POWER IN 
ANY FORM, IN ANY COUNTRY AROUND 
THE WORLD AND HE VIEWED THE 
FREE PRESS AS AN ANTIDOTE TO 
THAT. 
>>  I'M JUST CURIOUS. 
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AS A 
PRISONER OF WAR. 
BATTLING BRAIN CANCER. 
YOU DESCRIBED HIS LAST 
CONDITIONS IN THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS OF HIS LIFE. 
HOW WAS IT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO 
MAINTAIN SO MUCH OPTIMISM 
THROUGH IT ALL? 
>>  FIRST OF ALL I THINK HE 
JUST HAD A VERY UNIQUE ENERGY 
LEVEL THAT MOST OF US CAN'T 
HOPE TO MATCH. 
WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 
WAS SAYING THEY WOULD TALK IN 
TO THE NIGHT WHEN EVERYBODY 
ELSE HAD GONE TO SLEEP. 
WE HAVE HEARD STOREYS LINDSEY 
GRAHAM AND OTHERS OF THOSE TWO 
JUST TALKING AND TALKING AND, 
YOU NEGOTIATION HE HAD A 
CAPACITY FOR A CONVERSATION.  
HE WAS ABLE TO GET MORE DONE 
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FLAG. 
YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IS NOT 
ONLY A MAN WHOSE ARMS WERE 
BROKEN, WHO ENDURED TERRIBLE 
CONDITIONS AS A PRISONER OF WAR 
IN VIETNAM FOR SO MANY YEARS 
BUT ALSO BATTLED SKIN CANCER 
BEFORE HE GOT THE BRAIN CANCER 
DIAGNOSIS. 
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO THROUGHOUT 
HIS LIFE HAD TO DEAL WITH ANY 
NUMBER OF MEDICAL CHALLENGES 
AND WHEN I SPOKE TO GRANT WOODS 
THE OTHER DAY HE -- HE IS THE 
FORMER ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL 
WHO TALKED RIGHT AT THE START 
OF THE SERVICE AND HAD THAT 
GREAT STORY ABOUT WHAT A 
TERRIBLE DRIVER McCAIN WAS BUT 
HE INSISTED ON DRIVING ANY WAY 
AND THAT WOODS WAS AFRAID FOR 
HIS LIFE BECAUSE WHEN McCAIN 
WOULD GET DISTRACTED THE CAR 
WOULD VEER. 
HE SAID DISPITT ALL OF THOSE 
INJURIES McCAIN JUST NEVER 
REALLY SLOWED DOWN. 
HE -- HE IGNORED THEM. 
HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 
EXAMPLE TO RIDE FIRST CLASS 
WHEN HE WENT BACK AND FORTH 
BETWEEN ARIZONA AND WASHINGTON 
DC. 
OF COURSE, WHEN YOU SEE A WAR 
HERO AND A SENATOR GETTING ON 
THE PLANE THE AIRLINE IS LIKELY 
TO BUMP YOU UP TO FIRST CLASS. 
HE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THAT 
WOULD LOOK. 
SO HE WOULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF 
INTO AN ECONOMY SEAT WHICH OF 
COURSE HAD TO BE MUCH LESS 
COMFORTABLE FOR HIM THAN IT 
WOULD BE TO SIT IN THE FIRST 
CLASS SEAT. 
YOU KNOW WOODS AND OTHERS HAVE 
SAID THAT'S JUST NOT WHO HE 
WAS. 
>>  INCREDIBLE MOMENT. 
INCREDIBLE MEMORY. 
ON THE GROUND THERE OUTSIDE OF 
NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>  YOU'RE WELCOME. 
>>  WE ARE WATCHING THE IMAGES 
NOW OF THE HEARSE OUTSIDE OF 
THE NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST 
CHURCH. 
IT'LL MAKE ITS WAY TO THE 
AIRPORT WHERE IT'LL LEAVE LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON FOR WASHINGTON 
DC WHERE THE MEMORIES AND THE 
TRIBUTES WILL CONTINUE. 
THE FORMER SENATOR WILL LIE IN 
STATE AT THE CAPITOL AND 
FOLLOWED BY A SERVICE ON 
SATURDAY AT THE NATIONAL 
CATHEDRAL. 
>>> JOINING ME NOW IS DOUG 
WEED. 
I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS. 
DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE LEGACY 
OF JOHN McCAIN THAT PEOPLE 
REMEMBER THE MOST? 
>>  HIS BIPARTISAN AND REACHING 
OUT ACROSS THE AISLE. 
HIS INTEGRITY BECAUSE IT ALL 
STARTED THE KEATING FIVE AND 
THAT'S WHAT HE BUILT. 
WHAT STRUCK ME WATCHING THIS 
SERVICE WAS NOBODY TALKS ABOUT 
THIS BUT HE HAD A QUICK TEMPER 
AND JUST AS QUICKLY WOULD ASK 
YOU TO FORGIVE HIM. 
I HAD A FRIEND WHO -- HE MADE A 
MISTAKE. 
HE SAID THE WRONG THING ACT 
HER. 
HE APOLOGIZED AND HE SENT HER 
FLOWERS. 
HE WENT TO HEAR AND SAID I 
CAN'T KNEEL BECAUSE OF MY 
INJURIES BUT INSIDE I'M 
KNEELING ASKING YOU TO PLEASE 
FORGIVE ME AND THERE'S A STORY 
THAT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF 
GEORGE W BUSH TELLS SATURDAY 
THAT BACKSTAGE AT THE 
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DES 
MOINES THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY 
WHO WAS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER 
AND HE WANTED AUTOGRAPHS AND 
GEORGE W BUSH DID IT BUT HIS 
REAL HERO WAS JOHN McCAIN 
BECAUSE HIS OWN FATHER WAS A 
NAVY SEAL. 
AT THE TIME SENATOR McCAIN WAS 
VERY UPSET, THE DEBATE HADN'T 
GONE WELL. 
HE WAS RUSHING TO GET OUT OF 
THERE BACKSTAGE AND THE FATHER 
OF THIS BOY RAISED DOWN THE 
CORRIDOR, TAPPED HIM ON THE 
BACK AND McCAIN TURNED AROUND 
IN ANGER, WHAT'S GOING ON? 
CINDY TOUCHED HIM TO CALM DOWN 
AND THEY EXPLAINED THIS BOY 
WANTED AUTOGRAPH AND McCAIN 
JUST BROKE. 
HE SAID I'M SO SORRY AND HE 
SIGNED THIS LONG AUTOGRAPH. 
I THOUGHT OF THAT AS I WATCHED 
THE SERVICE BECAUSE JOHN McCAIN 
DIED OF BRAIN CANCER THOSE MANY 
YEARS LATER. 
>>  YOU TALK ABOUT BRAIN 
CANCER. 
IT WAS SO MANY PEOPLE 
MENTIONING ABOUT TED KENNEDY 
ALSO ABOUT JOE BIDEN'S SON, ALL 
-- ENDED UP DYING FROM BRAIN 
CANCER AS WELL. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS -- HIS 
FIGHT REALLY AT THE END, THE 
LAST FEW MONTHS. 
THEY WERE NOT EASY. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT SAYS ABOUT 
HIS TEMPERMENT AND ABILITY TO 
STAY OPTIMISTIC DESPITE IT ALL? 
>>  ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? 
IT'S A GREAT LESSON FOR LIFE 
FOR ALL OF US. 
HE DID NOT IMMERSE HIMSELF IN 
THE BAD LUCK OF WHAT HE WAS 
FACING. 
I LOVE THE WORDS. 
HE TOOK TIME TO THINK THIS 
THROUGH OBVIOUSLY. 
HE LEFT US WITH THESE WONDERFUL 
THOUGHTS OF THE LAST WEEKS OF 
HIS LIFE. 
THAT WAS ONE OF THEM THAT HE 
DOESN'T REGRET ANYTHING. 
TEDDY ROOSEVELT USED TO SAY TO 
HIS KIDS LIFE IS GLORIOUS AND 
HERE IS JOHN McCAIN WITH THE 
SAME THING. 
>>  HE HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE 
AND INPUT OVER HOW THIS FUNERAL 
WOULD BE. 
THE MEMORIAL SERVICES, FIVE 
DAYS OF HONORING HIM. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS IMPORTANT 
FOR HIM TO CONVEY? 
>>  ISN'T THAT AMAZING TO SEE 
WHAT WE ARE WATCHING AND 
HEARING. 
HE PLANNED. 
HE IS TALKING TO US THE MESSAGE 
THAT HE WANTED AND OF COURSE 
THE BATTLE NOW IS FOR HIS 
LEGACY AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE 
A SLAM DUNK. 
HE IS STILL SPEAKING TO US 
THROUGH THE GRAVE AND THROUGH 
THESE EVENTS HE HAS PLANNED. 
HE HAS DUB IT WELL. 
HE HAS DONE IT WELL. 
>>  WE HAVE A LIVE LOOK OF THE 
HEARSE AND YOU SEE THE 
MOTORCADE. 
THE POLICE TRAVELING WITH THE 
BODY AS IT'LL MAKE ITS WAY TO 
THE AIRPORT AND HEAD OVER TO 
WASHINGTON DC. 
YOU CAN TELL US WHY THE SENATOR 
DECIDED TO BE BURIED AT THE 
NAVAL ACADEMY INSTEAD OF 
ARLINGTON? 
>>  YEAH. 
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY BUT I KNOW 
HOW HE LOVED THE MILITARY AND 
THE NAVY AND I MENTIONED 
EARLIER HOW I WAS BACKSTAGE 
WITH HIM WHEN THEY STARTED 
PLAYING THE ANTHEMS AND HE 
STOOD UP LIKE A 9-YEAR-OLD 
CHILD AND MARCHED AROUND THE 
LITTLE TRAILER BACKSTAGE WHERE 
WE WERE. 
THE SPEAKERS WERE AND IT WAS 
VERY MUCH INTO IT. 
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HIS FATHER 
WAS AN ADMIRALS HIS GRANDFATHER 
WAS, THAT WAS THE TRADITION. 
HE GREW UP IN THAT. 
THAT WAS STEEPED IN HIM. 
I KNEW YOUR FATHER. 
I KNEW YOUR GRANDFATHER. 
HE WAS A HERO AND HE WAS 
HEARING ALL OF THESE STORIES. 
NOW HEAR HE COMES BACK HOME 
REALLY TO NO LONGER IN THE 
SHADOWS, NOW A GREAT FIGURE OF 
HISTORY AND AS YOU KNOW THEY 
ARE TALKING ABOUT NAMING ONE OF 
THE BUILDINGS AFTER HIM. 
THAT'S SOMETHING. 
THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OUR FIVE 
SENATORS WHO COULD GET THAT. 
THAT'S AN AMAZING MOMENT FOR US 
TO SEE HIS -- THE PASSING OF A 
GREAT MAN. 
>>  AND JUST HOW ACROSS THE 
AISLE HOW LOVED. 
WE SHOULD NOTE THERE ARE 24 
CURRENT OR PAST SENATORS WHO 
ACTUALLY MADE THE TRIP OUT TO 
ARIZONA TO HONOR AND REMEMBER 
HIM. 
ONE OF THEM, JOE BIDEN. 
HE STARTS OFF. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. 
HE SAID MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN, 
I'M A DEMOCRAT AND I LOVE JOHN 
McCAIN. 
>>  YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT. 
THIS IS -- BIPARTISAN. 
IT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
LONG FOR AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE 
AND YET IT'S SUCH A BITTER 
TIME. 
IT TAKES UNUSUAL PEOPLE TO 
REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND TO 
CLOSE THAT GULF. 
IT'S INTERESTING. 
WHEN YOU GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
AND YOU LOOK BACK ON AMERICA WE 
ARE SO MUCH ALIKE COMPARED TO 
POLITICAL PARTIES IN OTHER 
COUNTRIES THAT REALLY DEBATE 
OPPOSITES. 
YOU GET HOME AND IT'S JUST LIKE 
COUSINS OR A FIGHT WITH IN THE 
FAMILY. 
IT CAN BE SO BITTER, THE CLOSER 
WE ARE THE MORE BITTER 
SOMETIMES THE FIGHT CAN BE. 
THIS TIME OF MOURNING, OF JOHN 
McCAIN CERTAINLY GIVES US THE 
FEELING OF HOW WONDERFUL IT 
WOULD BE IF WE COULD WORK 
TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN. 
>>  HE WASN'T ALSO AFRAID TO 
SORT OF STAND UP EVEN IF IT 
MEANT WITH IN HIS OWN PARTY. 
I REMEMBER BACK TO THE IRAQ WAR 
WITH PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH IF 
IT WAS TORTURE, THE WAR, HE 
WASN'T AFRAID TO HOLD THE 
ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBLE NO 
MATTER WHAT. 
WHY -- HE WAS A VOICE THAT 
PEOPLE REALLY HELD IN HIGH 
REGARD BECAUSE OF HIS TIME 
OVERSEAS AND AS A POW. 
WHY DID YOU THINK IT IS WHEN 
YOU TALK OF WAR AND HIS TIME ON 
THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES 
COMMITTEE. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT HE 
WANTS PEOPLE TO REMEMBER ABOUT 
LIFE ABROAD SERVING YOUR  
COUNTRY? 
>>  YEAH. 
WELL, AGAIN HANOI HILTON SHAPED 
HIS LIFE AND AMONG OTHER THINGS 
TOOK THE FEAR AWAY. 
LINCOLN TALKED ABOUT THAT. 
LINCOLN AFTER THE LOSS OF HIS 
SON -- HE TOLD HIS LAW PARTNER 
I CAN'T GO HOME. 
EVERY ROOM I GO INTO I SEE MY 
LITTLE BOY AND HE WENT INTO 
PUBLIC LIFE TO BE ALONE, TO 
ESCAPE HOME AND MARY WHO 
REMINDED HIM OF THE LOSS HE 
HAD. 
HE WENT INTO PUBLIC LIFE ALL 
THESE PEOPLE TO BE ALONE. 
I THINK A PART OF JOHN McCAIN, 
HE SUFFERED SO MUCH IN THAT WAR 
IT WAS LIKE -- WHAT MORE CAN 
HAPPEN? 
HE SAW HOW BAD IT CAN GET AND 
THAT'S WHAT MADE LIFE AND 
LIVING GLORIOUS FOR HIM AND 
WHAT HELPED HIM DO WHAT YOU 
SAID, TO SPEAK UP ON SOME OF 
THESE ISSUES, WHAT CAN HAPPEN 
TO ME ANY WORSE THAN WHAT I 
HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED? 
>>  WE ARE WATCHING THE HEARSE 
MAKE ITS WAY IN TO THE AIRPORT 
AND TRAVEL ONTO WASHINGTON DC. 
WATCHING THAT BEAUTIFUL 
CEREMONY AT NORTH PHOENIX 
BAPTIST CHURCH. 
I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN'S OWN FAITH. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT IT? 
>>  WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE 
HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS 
CHURCH FOR MANY YEARS. 
FOR MUCH OF HIS LIFE. 
SO, AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE 
CHOICE OF THE SPEAKERS AND THE 
SCRIPTURES THAT HE USED. 
IT WAS A PERSONAL AND PRIVATE 
PART OF HIS LIFE. 
HE UNDERSTOOD AND KNEW, I HAD A 
CONVERSATION WITH HIM ABOUT THE 
ANTIPATHY IN THE MEDIA TOWARD 
PEOPLE OF FAITH AND HE DIDN'T 
CARRY THAT ON HIS SLEEVE FOR 
HIS OWN POLITICAL PURPOSES AND 
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. 
YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU FACE 
ISSUES OF LIFE AND DEATH PEOPLE 
HAVE THESE VERY DEEPLY HELD 
POSITIONS AND BELIEFS AND IDEAS 
AND HERE THEY ARE ON FULL 
DISPLAY. 
HE IS EMBRACING HIS FAITH FOR 
HIS FAMILY IN THIS CEREMONY. 
>>  I WAS READING ABOUT HIS 
LIFE AND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS, 
TOMMY ESPINOZA TELLS THIS GREAT 
STORY ABOUT WHEN McCAIN ASKED 
HIM TO BE HIS GODFATHER. 
TOMMY SAID YOU KNOW I'M A 
CATHOLIC, I'M NOT BAPTIST AND 
McCAIN SAID THAT'S OKAY. 
OKAY I WILL BE THE GOOD FATHER. 
HE INCLUDED EVERYBODY. 
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE 
FUNERAL BUT ABOUT HIS LIFE. 
>>  YEAH. 
THAT HAPPENS OFTEN TO  
POLITICIANS. 
THEY -- THEY CRITICIZE SOME OF 
THESE POLITICIANS, HARING WITH 
HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH 
CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS AND THEY 
CRITICIZE THEM BECAUSE THEY 
FEEL THEY DON'T REMAIN ORTHODOX 
TO THEIR FAITH. 
BY THE TIME YOU ARE ELECTED 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
OR YOU HAVE A PUBLIC CAREER 
LIKE JOHN McCAIN YOU HAVE 
RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH PEOPLE 
FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT POCKETS 
THAT YOU KIND OF DEVELOP YOUR 
OWN VERSION OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE 
AND WHY YOU BELIEVE IT. 
IT HAS TO BE MORE INCLUDING 
THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE. 
IT'S GREAT WHEN YOU LIVE IN THE 
PROVINCE AND YOU CAN BELIEVE 
WHAT YOU WHAT YOU BELIEVE UNTIL 
THE MOMENT YOU DIE. 
YOU GET OUT IN THE PUBLIC LIFE 
AND YOU MEET PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE 
THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY 
AND YOU DEVELOP A TOLERANCE YOU 
WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE. 
>>  ALSO IN THE PUBLIC LIGHT 
THIS WEEK THE STATE OF ARIZONA. 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT HE 
WAS ONCE LABELED WHEN HE RAN 
FOR SENATOR A CARPET BAGGER 
BECAUSE HE WASN'T FROM ARIZONA 
ORIGINALLY. 
HARD TO IMAGINE. 
>>  NOW HE EMBRACES ARIZONA AND 
ARIZONA EMBRACES HIM. 
THAT HARKENS BACK TO THE 
KEATING FIVE THING. 
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT HE 
EXPERIENCED IN LIFE AND IT'S A 
LESSON I KEEP TEACHING MY 
CHILDREN AND MY GRANDCHILDREN. 
NONE OF THESE SET BACKS, NONE 
OF THESE HURTS, NONE OF THESE 
ACCUSATIONS, NONE OF THESE 
CRITICISMS ARE FATAL. 
DEATH IS FATAL. 
ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN COME BACK 
FROM AND HE DID THAT. 
HE BECAME THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT 
HAD HAPPENED TO HIM IN THE 
KEATING FIVE AND HE WIPED OUT 
ALL CONCERNS ABOUT IF HE WAS A 
TRUE ARIZONA RESIDENT OR NOT. 
MOST ARIZONA RESIDENTS WERE NOT 
BORN IN ARIZONA. 
>>  THAT'S A GOOD POINT. 
I WANT TO YOU CAN ABOUT THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS. 
WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA 
AND PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH 
WILL SPEAK IN WASHINGTON. 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT AND 
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE TWO 
FORMER PRESIDENTS WHO HE ONCE 
FACED OFF WITH FOR THE HIGHEST 
OFFICE? 
>>  I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING TO SAY 
OR DO. 
I KNOW. 
RELATIONSHIP? 
>>  WE KNOW HOW DEEPLY BITTER 
THE RELATIONSHIP WAS WITH 
GEORGE W BUSH BUT HE HAS AN 
ABILITY TO FOR GIVEN AND JOHN 
McCAIN AS I SAID EARLIER HAS AN 
ABILITY TO FORGIVE AND OFTEN 
DID. 
HE WOULD LOOSE HIS TEMPER, BE 
MAD AND REGRET IT, WOE GO BACK 
AND BEG FOR FORGIVENESS. 
IT WAS HIS PERSONALITY AND 
OBAMA, WHAT -- IT MUST MELT 
OBAMA'S HEART EVERY TIME HE 
SEES THAT VIDEO WHERE McCAIN IS 
STANDING UP FOR HIM AS A FAMILY 
 
McCAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT 
BITTER CAMPAIGN. 
HE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS 
IS A MOMENT OF HISTORY AND 
AFRICAN AMERICAN THAT COULD BE 
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>>  ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE 
MOMENT WHERE SOMEONE SAID HE IS 
ARAB AND HE SAID NO, HE IS A 
MAN. 
>>  THAT'S WHAT WE SAID. 
IS HE A GOOD MAN AND A FAMILY 
MAN. 
IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT OBAMA 
WAS SUCH A FAMILY MAN WHETHER 
YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR 
REPUBLICAN. 
McCAIN HAD TO SAY THIS IS A MAN 
WHO HAS BEEN GOOD TO HIS WIFE 
AND GOODTO HIS CHILDREN AND 
HAD THE NICE COMBINATION A LOT 
OF PRESIDENTS SPOIL THEIR 
CHILDREN BUT THERE WAS A NICE 
MIX OF LOVE AND DISCIPLINE ON 
THE McCAIN -- ON THE OBAMA 
FAMILY AND McCAIN RECOGNIZED 
THAT AND GAVE CREDIT WHERE IT 
WAS DUE. 
>>  WE ARE WATCHING AGAIN THE 
BODY OF JOHN McCAIN HEADING 
TOWARD THE AIRPORT AS HE WILL 
HEAD TO WASHINGTON DC AND BE 
HONORED BY HIS COLLEAGUES ON 
CAPITOL HILL AS WELL AS FORMER 
PRESIDENTS'S WE MENTIONED. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LIFE AND 
THE LEGACY OF JOHN McCAIN WE 
TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT HOW HE 
LIVED. 
I JUST THINK IT'S FASCINATING 
ALSO HOW HE CHOSE TO DIE. 
PLANNING OUT HIS FUNERAL IN THE 
COMFORT OF HIS HOME STATE AND 
ALSO REALLY PUTTING IN THE 
SPOTLIGHT BRAIN CANCER. 
I HAVE BEEN READING A GREAT 
DEAL ABOUT BRAIN CANCER AND HOW 
IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR HIM TO 
SHRINE A LIGHT ON THAT AS WELL. 
>>  WHAT HAPPENED TO BEAU AND 
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH BIDEN. 
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS HOW 
QUICKLY THIS HAPPENED ONCE HE 
WENT OFF THE MEDICATION. 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE TURNING OFF 
THE LIGHT SWITCH. 
LIKE I GOT EVERYTHING SET AND 
DONE AND NOW HERE WE GO. 
IT'S LIKE EVERY OTHER PART OF 
HIS LIFE SEEMED LIKE HE WAS IN 
CONTROL THERE TOO. 
>>  YEAH. 
IT'S JUST HARD TO IGNORE AT THE 
END OF THAT MEMORIAL SERVICE 
HOW FRANK SINATRA PLAYED 
THROUGH THE CROWD AT THE END MY 
WAY. 
>>  I DID IT MY WAY. 
I HAVE LIVED THAT LIFE, YEAH. 
NO ACCIDENT. 
MAKES ME CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT 
MORE WILL UNFOLD AS WE 
CELEBRATE HIS LIFE ON SATURDAY. 
>>  YEAH. 
YOU KNOW WE TALKED SO MUCH 
ABOUT HIS LEGACY BUT IS THERE 
SOMEONE RIGHT NOW ON CAPITOL 
HILL OR POSSIBLY ENTERING 
CAPTAIN HILL WHO COULD BE A 
FUTURE JOHN McCAIN? 
>>  THERE MUST BE BUT I DON'T 
KNOW WHO IT IS. 
RIGHT NOW I MEAN NAMING A 
BUILDING AFTER HIM, POSSIBLY 
WHICH THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 
AND A NAMING A BUILDING THAT'S 
NAMED AFTER A DEMOCRAT SENATOR 
-- A REPUBLICAN SENATOR, THAT'S 
A BIT UNUSUAL. 
YOU HAVE TO PUT HIM IN THE 
CATEGORY WITH DANIEL WEBSTER 
AND WITH HENRY CLAY AND WITH 
EVER RECEIPT DIRKSON AND BOY I 
MISS HIM, AND ROBERT TAFT. 
HE HAS TO BE AMONG A HANDFUL OF 
THE GREATIST SENATORS IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY AND IT'S GOING 
TO BE HARD FOR SOMEONE 
OVERNIGHT TO MATCH THAT. 
>>  CERTAINLY WILL BE NO MATTER 
WHAT. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS? 
YOU HAVE HAD TIME TO INTERVIEW 
AND SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND MEET 
WITH HIM. 
WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU ABOUT 
JOHN McCAIN? 
>>  YOU KNOW ITS INTERESTING. 
I HAVE INTERVIEWED SIX 
PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
SOME OF THEM MANY, MANY HOURS. 
WHAT SURPRISES ME THE MOST 
ABOUT JOHN McCAIN IS HIS SENSE 
OF HUMOR AND HIS SARCASM. 
HE JUST DIDN'T TAKE HIMSELF OR 
LIFE OR THE ISSUES THAT 
SERIOUSLY. 
HE COULD TALK TO THE ISSUES BUT 
THERE WOULD BE THIS SLY GRIN ON 
HIS FACE AND HE WOULD COME UP 
WITH SOME HUMOR IN IT SOMEWHERE 
AND I LOVED THAT ABOUT HIM AND 
THAT SETTINGS HIM APART FROM 
MANY OF THE OTHER VERY SERIOUS 
PEOPLE THAT I INTERVIEWED WHO 
TAKE THEMSELVES AND TAKE LIFE 
VERY SERIOUSLY. 
>>  A LONG WAY ESPECIALLY IN 
POLITICS WON'T IT? 
>>  THAT'S RIGHT. 
ABSOLUTELY. 
YOU NEED IT. 
>>  YOU DEFINITELY NEED IT 
WITHOUT A DOUBT. 
AS WE ARE WATCHING THIS -- THE 
BODY OF JOHN McCAIN AND HIS 
CASKE, T WILL ARRIVE HERE AT 
THE AIRPORT AND BE TAKEN ON 
BOARD THIS PLANE YOU ARE SEEING 
HERE TO WASHINGTON DC. 
IN FACT IT'LL HEAD FIRST TO 
JOINT BASE ANDREWS AND THEN 
MAKING ITS WAY EVENTUALLY TO 
THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL. 
AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
LIFE AND LEGACY. 
WHAT I DIDN'T SAY EARLIER -- WE 
COULDN'T SEE THE SHOT. 
THERE WERE ABOUT A THOUSAND 
PEOPLE WHO CHOSE TO GATHER 
OUTSIDE OF THIS CHURCH WHO WERE 
ALLOWED -- THE PUBLIC ALLOWED 
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 
I SHOULD SAY THEY BRAVED ALMOST 
100-DEGREE TEMPERATURES TO 
STAND OUTSIDE FOR HOURS. 
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED IN. 
THE CAPACITY AT THE CHURCH WAS 
2,000 ONLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE 
WITH THIS LEVEL OF SECURITY AND 
VIP. 
A THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED 
TO GATHER OUTSIDE AND IN THE 
HEAT TO SAY GOOD-BYE AND PAY 
THEIR RESPECTS. 
WHAT DOES IT MAP FOR PEOPLE IN 
ARIZONA WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A 
MAN WHO SERVED 35 YEARS 
REPRESENTING THE STATE? 
>>  YEAH.
AND YOU KNOW -- MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE IN ARIZONA ARE IN 
CALIFORNIA THIS MONTH. 
>>  THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT. 
>>  IT'S VERY, VERY HOT. 
I WAS SO SURPRISED BY THE 
NUMBERS BUT I HAVE TALKED TO 
MANY OF MY FRIENDS IN ARIZONA 
AND ASKED THEM THAT SAME 
QUESTION AND BEEN AMAZED AT 
FRIENDS WHO -- I WOULDN'T USE 
THE WORD HATE BUT HAD GREAT 
ANGER TOWARD JOHN McCAIN 
BECAUSE IT WAS A HIGH WIRE ACT 
FOR HIM TO APPEAL TO THE MEDIA 
AND TO APPEAL TO DEMOCRATS AND 
BUILD HIS CAREER DOING THAT 
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE 
REPRESENTING THIS VERY -- AT 
THE TIME CONSERVATIVE STATE IN 
ARIZONA AND TO DO THAT AND GET 
AWAY WITH IT YOU SEE THE 
POLITICAL CAREER OF JEFF FLAKE 
AND YOU GET AN IDEA OF HOW HARD 
IT IS TO PULL THAT OFF.  
IT'S USUALLY BASED ON WHAT THEY 
TOLD YOU ABOUT EARLIER. 
HIS ABILITY OR HIS DESIRE TO 
SEEK FORGIVENESS WHEN HE WOULD 
MAKE A MISTAKE OR SAY IT THE 
WRONG WAY. 
HE WOULD SEEK OUT THAT PERSON 
AND SAY THAT WAS WRONG OF ME. 
I'M SORRY. 
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? 
THAT IS SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL 
IN POLITICS. 
>>  VERY UNUSUAL. 
I'M SORRY. 
IT IS THE HARDEST WORD FOR SO 
MANY OF US TO SAY. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU DID YOU EVER 
GET A CHANCE TO INTERVIEW HIS 
-- WHO IS NOW 106, HIS MOTHER? 
>>  NO. 
I NEVER DID. 
>>  I'M JUST FASCINATED BY 
SEEING HER. 
106. 
>>  AMAZING. 
>>  SHE WILL I BELIEVE BE 
ATTENDING THE SERVICE AT THE 
NATIONAL CATHETRAL AT THE DC 
AND THE BURIAL THAT WILL HAPPEN 
AT THE UNITED STATES NAVAL 
ACADEMY ON SUNDAY. 
JOE BIDEN, I THINK IT WAS 
POIGNANT TALKED ABOUT HOW 
NOBODY SHOULD BE AROUND TO BURY 
THEIR OWN CHILD. 
>>  YEAH. 
>>  OF COURSE HIS OWN SON 
PASSING. 
>>  TWO I SHOULD SAY. 
>>  WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS 
SO MANY MANY OF THESE GREAT MEN 
AND PRESIDENTS AND CANDIDATES 
ARE MOMMA'S BOYS AND THEY HAVE 
AN ABSENT FATHER. 
THAT WAS TRUE OF GEORGE W BUSH. 
THEY SAID TO GEORGE HW BUSH I 
BET YOU ARE PROUD OF HIM. 
HOW DID YOU RAISE HIM AND HE 
SAID I WASN'T THERE. 
BARBARA RAISED HIM AND OBAMA'S 
FATHER WAS ABSENT. 
IT'S THE SAME STORY OFFER AND 
OVER STARTING GEORGE WASHINGTON 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH HISTORY. 
DEFINITELY WITH JOHN McCAIN 
TOO. 
AN ABSENT FATHER BUT A VERY 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A 
MOTHER. 
>>  WE ARE WATCHING THE HEARSE 
PULL IN TO THE AIRPORT HERE IN 
ARIZONA, PHOENIX. 
YOU KNOW I WAS ALSO STRUCK 
ABOUT DURING THIS MEMORIAL 
SERVICE ABOUT THE ATTENTION HE 
ALSO HAD A FLUTIST FROM THE 
NAVAJO COMMUNITY. 
HOW HE WANTED THIS TO NOT JUST 
BE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, 
INCLUDING THE CULTURE THERE AS 
WELL. 
>>  YEAH. 
HE IS SHOWING OFF ARIZONA. 
>>  HE DID LOVE THAT STATE. 
>>  SUCH A DIVERSE STATE AND 
THAT MUSIC. 
THERE WERE MOMENTS THAT HE WAS 
MOVED IN LIFE AND HE WANTED US 
TO FEEL THEM AND -- TO HEAR 
THEM AND SEE THEM SO EVERYTHING 
WAS THERE IN THIS CELEBRATION 
AND USUALLY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS HAPPENS YOU THINK, IF THEY 
COULD ONLY BA LIVE TO SEE THIS 
THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE 
SURPRISED. 
I HAVE A FEELING THAT JOHN 
McCAIN IS NOT SURPRISED. 
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 
>>  HIS DIRECTING OF EVENTS 
BEYOND THE GRAVE. 
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 
THE CASKET HAS MADE A SIX MILE 
TRIP FROM INITIALLY THIS 
MORNING THE ARIZONA STATE 
HOUSE, OVER TO THE NORTH 
PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH WHERE WE 
HAVE THE FUNERAL SERVICES 
TODAY. 
THE MEMORIAL SERVICES I SHOULD 
SAY FOR THE LATE SENATOR. 
OF ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT SPOKE 
TODAY AND HONORED HIM WHAT 
STANDS OUT TO YOU? 
>>  I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH 
GRANT WOODS SPEECH THAT JUST 
STRUCK ME. 
>>  WHAT WAS IT? 
>>  SO WELL DONE. 
IT WAS JUST SO BALANCED. 
THE HUMOR AND HE JUST CAPTURED 
JOHN McCAIN SO WELL. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCHA AN HONOR 
THAT HE WOULD SPEND THE TIME 
AND THOUGHT THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL TO DELIVER SUCH A GREAT 
AND WONDERFUL TESTIMONY TO HIM. 
I WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THAT. 
>>  YOU KNOW IT SAYS SOMETHING 
TOO THAT SO MANY FORMER FOLKS 
WHO WORKED ON HIS CAMPAIGN WHO 
ADVISED HIM HAVE BEEN SUCH AN 
IMPORTANT PART OF THE PUBLIC 
IMAGE OF JOHN McCAIN AND 
RETELLING THE STORIES OF HIM 
BEHIND THE SCENES. 
>>  I'M SURPRISED BY THAT. 
I'M SURPRISED MOSTLY BY THE 
PEOPLE WHO OPPOSED HIM AND 
WRITE ALL OF THESE HATEFUL 
THINGS AND COMMENTS ON YOUTUBE 
AND TWEETS. 
I HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF THOSE 
PEOPLE AND THEY WILL BE THE 
FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE 
WAS A GREAT SENATOR AND THEY 
RESPECT HIM FOR WHAT HE 
ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE DID AND 
WHO HE WAS. 
>>  ONE TIME FORMER UNITED 
STATES NAVY PILOT. 
HEN TOURED FIVE AND A HALF 
YEARS AS A POW IN VIETNAM. 
VERY CELEBRATED CAREER ON 
CAPITOL HILL. 
THE STATE OF ARIZONA SAYS GOOD-
BYE TO HIM AS HIS BODY WILL 
HEAD TO WASHINGTON DC TO THE 
NATION'S CAPITOL. 
>>> MISSING, THE FORMER 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE'S FORMER 
RUNNING MATE, SARAH PALIN. 
WHY IS THAT? 
WHAT WAS THEIR REP LIKE AFTER 
THAT RUN? 
>>  THAT'S A VERY COMPLICATED 
STORY BUT JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT A 
PERFECT POLITICIAN. 
HE WENT LATE INTO THAT CAMPAIGN 
WITHOUT SECURING HIS CHRISTIAN 
BASE. 
YOU CAN SEE HE ATTENDED A 
CHURCH AND WAS A MEMBER OF IT 
FOR MANY YEARS, HAD MET WITH 
SOME OF THE LEADERS BUT HE 
WAITED TOO LATE TO SECURE HIS 
BASE. 
OBAMA WHO IS A FANTASTIC 
POLITICIAN, SPOTTED IT. 
HE LAUNCHED WHAT WAS CALLED 
OPERATION JOSHUA THAT WENT OVER 
THE HEADS OF THE NATIONAL 
IMMEDIATEY. 
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT HE 
WAS RAIDING McCAIN'S CHRISTIAN 
BASE, WHITE VOTERS AND THE 
McCAIN CAMPAIGN PANICKED. 
THEY TRIED A FEW THINGS THAT 
BACK FIRED THE PASTOR FROM OHIO 
AND TEXAS, GOT THEM IN WORSE 
TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY WERE 
STARTING TOO LATE AND SARAH 
PALIN WAS THE PERFECT MISSING 
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT SOLVED 
IT. 
THERE WAS ABOUT A WEEK WHERE 
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN WAS STUNNED 
LIKE A DEER CAUGHT IN 
HEADLIGHTS WHERE THEY THOUGHT 
OH NO, HE OF HE FIGURED IT OUT 
BUT SARAH PALIN IMPLODED. 
SHE WASN'T PREPARED AND I THINK 
THIS WAS -- BY NOT INVITING HER 
TO THE FUNERAL I THINK THIS WAS 
THE TIP TO THE NATIONAL MEDIA 
ALL HIS LIFE. 
HE LEANED TOWARD THEM ON EVENTS 
AND ON DECISIONS ABOUT TRUMP, 
EVEN THE SAME THING. 
I THINK THIS WAS HIM SAYING 
THAT Y I KNOW I MADE A MISTAKE 
WITH LETTER AND IT -- IT IS 
WHAT IT IS. 
HE LOST THAT CAMPAIGN. 
IT WAS A CLOSE CAMPAIGN BUT 
PALIN SOLVED IT BRIEFLY BUT SHE 
WASN'T QUITE READY. 
>>  SO MUCH OF THESE NEXT FEW 
DAYS IN THE MEMORIAL IN 
WASHINGTON DC WILL HAVE TO DO 
ALSO ABOUT WHAT WE DID NOT LIKE 
ABOUT POLITICS. 
WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT BE 
INVITED, WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE 
YOU THINK JOHN McCAIN WAS 
TRYING TO SAY WITH THAT? 
>>  I THINK THAT'S OBVIOUS, 
AGAIN, HE -- THEY GOT INTO A 
FIGHT. 
IN FAIRNESS IT'S NOT OFTEN 
COVERED, JOHN McCAIN SHOT OFF 
FIRST. 
HE SAID THEY ARE CRAZIES. 
HE WAS EMBARRASSED. 
HERE WERE 10,000 PEOPLE THAT 
SHOWED UP TO GREET TRUMP. 
THEY SHOWED UP AT THE 
CONVENTION CENTER IN PHOENIX. 
THIS BIG CROWD AND McCAIN WAS 
PULLING 200 PEOPLE AT HIS TOWN 
HALL MEETING AND HERE THIS 
OUTSIDER TRUMP PULLED 10,000 
PEOPLE. 
HE CALLED THEM CRAZIES BUT THEY 
WERE PEOPLE FROM HIS OWN STATE 
OF ARIZONA. 
TRUMP FIRED BACK. 
I LIKE MY HEROES THAT WEREN'T 
CAPTURED AND SO HERE WENT THIS 
PUBLIC, OPEN FIGHT EMBARRASSING 
FUED BETWEEN THE TWO AND McCAIN 
HAS EVER RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO HE 
WANTS TO HONOR AND WHY IN THIS 
CELEBRATION OF HIS OWN LIFE. 
I THINK HIS MESSAGE IS WE HAVE 
TO BE INCLUDING. 
WE HAVE TO GET ALONG TOGETHER 
AND -- NOBODY WILL BULLY ME. 
I THINK THAT'S HIS MESSAGE. 
>>  WE ARE SEEING THE LIVING 
IMAGES RIGHT NOW OF THE McCAIN 
FAMILY ON THE TARMAC THERE AS 
THE CASKET WILL BE REMOVE FROM 
THE CAR AND PLACED ON TO THE 
PLANE TO HEAD TO WASHINGTON DC. 
WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT MEGAN 
McCAIN GIVING A HUG TO HER 
SISTER BRIDGETT ON THE FAR 
LEFT. 
YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST SO HARD TO 
WATCH MEGAN McCAIN PLACING A 
KISS ON THE CASKET YESTERDAY AT 
THE STATE HOUSE WHEN THE BODY 
ARRIVED, JUST THE GRIEF OF JUST 
SO VISIBLE AND HARD TO IGNORE. 
>>  YEAH. 
I THINK MEGAN HAS DONE MORE FOR 
HER FATHER TO HUMANIZE HIM AND 
TO REMIND US THAT HE IS A DAD 
AND THAT SIDE OF HIM IN THE 
LAST FEW YEARS HER APTS ON TV, 
I THINK IT'S -- IT'S HAD A BIG 
IMPACT AND THAT IS OFTEN BEEN 
THE CASE. 
THAT'S THE CASE WITH JENNA BUSH 
TOO FOR GEORGE W BUSH. 
IT'S THE CASE OF IVANKA TRUMP 
WITH DONALD TRUMP FOR MANY 
PEOPLE. 
IT'S PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER 
THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND OF 
COURSE IT -- CHANGED EVERYTHING 
WITH LINCOLN WHEN HE LOST 
WILLIE. 
AND HE AND HIS WIFE WERE 
TRANSFORMED AND LINCOLN COULD 
UNDERSTAND THE MANY FAMILIES 
WHO HAD EXPERIENCED SO MUCH 
LOSS DURING THE CIVIL WAR. 
ALL OF THAT WAS CHANGED BY THIS 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. 
I THINK THAT -- WHEN I SEE 
MEGAN I THINK OF SOMEONE THAT 
HE WAS VERY PROUD OF. 
YOU HEARD IN THE SPEECHES THAT 
WERE GIVEN TODAY SOMEONE SAY 
YOU YOU WATCHING MEGAN? 
I THINK IT WAS TONY THAT HE 
SAID NO, I DON'T WATCH TV. 
SENATOR McCAIN SAID YOU START 
WATCHING TV AND YOU WATCH 
MEGAN. 
HE WAS PROUD OF HER. 
>>  I WANT TO TAKE US TO THE 
HEARSE. 
YOU SEE AS THE CASKET IS BEING 
REMOVED AT PHOENIX SKY HARBOR 
AIRPORT. 
LET'S LISTEN IN.  
. 
>> WATCHING THE FINAL FAREWELLS 
AS ARIZONA BIDS GOOD-BYE TO 
THEIR LONG TIME SENATOR 35 
YEARS IN THE SENATE. 
JOHN McCAIN, HIS FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS, WE ARE JOINED BY STATE 
AND LOCAL FIRMS, EVEN TR IB AL 
OFFICIALS TO BID FAREWELL. 
THE SERVICES HAPPENED AT THE 
NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH. 
ARIZONA NATIONAL GUARD THERE 
RETRIEVED THE CASKET. 
WE KNOW THAT THE FAMILY, GREAT 
DEAL OF PLANNING WENT INTO THIS 
AND THE SENATOR IN FACT -- 
WEIGHED IN AS TO HOW HE WANTED 
THESE FIVE DAYS OF CELEBRATION, 
OF HIS LIFE AND THE FRIENDS HE 
KEPT AND THE CAREER HE LED. 
THE BODY WILL NOW GO TO JOINT 
BASE ANDREWS. 
WE EXPECT A VERY LIVELY 
CEREMONY TO TAKE PLACE SATURDAY 
MORNING AT THE NATIONAL 
CATHEDRAL AND HIS FINAL RESTING 
PLACE WILL BE IN ANNAPOLIS 
MARYLAND AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY. 
>>> I WANT TO LISTEN IN NOW.  
. 
>>> YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE 
SENDOFF FOR JOHN McCAIN. 
I WANT TO BRING IN JAMIE WHO 
WAS OUTSIDE OF THE MEMORIAL 
SERVICE. 
NORTH -- EXCUSE ME, PHOENIX 
CHURCH. 
WHAT YOU CAN TELL US? 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE? 
I KNOW IT WAS VERY HOT. 
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD? 
>>  THERE'S BEEN AN OUTPOURING 
OF LOVE. 
AS WE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS AND 
POLITICIANS. 
BUSINESS LEADERS IN ARIZONA. 
ALSO IN THE CROWD. 
WE STARTED THE DAY DOWN AT THE 
UNITED STATES -- AT THE ARIZONA 
STATE HOUSE WHERE SO MANY 
PEOPLE HAD TURNED OUT. 
THEY WANTED TO HOLD FLAGS. 
THEY HELD SIGNS FROM 2008 WHEN 
McCAIN RAN FOR PRESIDENT. 
THERE WERE SIGNS THAT SAID 
McCAIN ON THEM. 
THE MOTORCADE CAME THERE. 
THERE WAS THE NATIONAL GUARD 
DID A CEREMONY. 
BROUGHT THE CASKET. 
PUT IT INTO THE HEARSE THAT 
CAME TO NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST 
CHURCH WHERE THE MEMORIAL 
SERVICE TOOK PLACE. 
SO MANY WONDERFUL SPECIES 
HAPPENED TODAY OF COURSE. 
THE BIGGEST NAME OF THE GROUP 
WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT, JOE 
BIDEN. 
YOU ALSO HEARD FROM LARRY 
FITZGERALD WHO AT TIMES WAS 
FUNNY. 
AT TIMES THEY WERE VERY FUNNY 
AND AT TIMES VERY SERIOUS. 
LARRY FITZGERALD'S SPEECH 
TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT WE 
SHOULD BE EMBRACING HOUR 
DIFFERENCES. 
WHICH COULD BE SEEN IN THE 
CROWD ITSELF AS WELL. 
THERE WERE 24 SITTING UNITED 
STATES SENATORS WHO CAME TO THE 
MEMORIAL SERVICE HERE IN 
ARIZONA TODAY. 
14 OF THEM WERE REPUBLICANS, 
TEN WERE DEMOCRATS. 
SO IT WAS JUST A WIDE RANGE AND 
BIPARTISAN KIND OF SUPPORT HERE 
AND AUDIENCE FOR THIS MEMORIAL 
SERVICE ITSELF. 
I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING THAT 
STRUCK US THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
TODAY IS JUST HOW TOUGH THIS 
HAS BEEN ON THE FAMILY. 
WE HEARD FROM IT WOULD HAVE THE 
CHILDREN TODAY. 
THEY GAVE SHORT READINGS WITH 
IN THE CEREMONY OF LIFE AS 
WELL. 
BRIDGETT AND ANDREW. 
AS WE HAVE WATCHED FOR MOVEMENT 
FROM PLACE TO PLACE YOU CAN SEE 
BOTH MEGAN McCAIN HIS DAUGHTER 
AND HIS WIFE CINDY McCAIN NOW A 
WIDOW, BOTH VERY, VERY -- 
HAVING A TOUGH TIME WITH THE 
EMOTIONS OF ALL OF THIS. 
AS YOU SAID IT'S VERY HOT. 
IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS BUT I 
THINK THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO 
ARIZONA AND WANTING TO COME OUT 
AND GIVE THIS SHOW OF LOVE, 
YESTERDAY AND WEDNESDAY PEOPLE 
STOOD IN LINE AT THE STATE 
HOUSE FOR HOURS. 
THERE WERE 12 TO 15,000 PEOPLE 
ITS THOUGHT WHO TURNED OWL TO 
SEE HIM LIE IN STATE. 
>>  JUST AN AMAZING TRIBUTE 
TODAY AND THE PEOPLE WHO LOVED 
HIM FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. 
YOU TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT THE 
FOLKS OUTSIDE. 
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE 
PEOPLE OF ARIZONA AND EXACTLY 
WHAT TOUCHED THEM THE MOST 
ABOUT HIS LIFE? 
>>  I THINK WHAT'S REALLY 
INTERESTING IS THAT IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF 
ARIZONA SENATOR McCAIN WAS A 
SENATOR FOR THE STATE FOR A 
THIRD OF THE STATE'S HISTORY. 
HE WAS IN OFFICE FOR MORE THAN 
30 YEARS HERE AS A SENATOR. 
MANY PEOPLE HERE GREW UP ONLY 
KNOWING HIM AS A SEVEN FOR 
THEIR STATE. 
THERE'S BEEN A SHOW OF LOVE. 
YOU HAVE SEEN CARDS, DIFFERENT 
MOMENTOS LEFT AT VARIOUS PLACES 
FROM THE FUNERAL HOME WHERE HE 
WAS SENT SATURDAY TO THE STATE 
HOUSE. 
PEOPLE LEAVING BALLOONS, MANY 
OF THOSE CARDS AND LETTERS, 
TALK ABOUT HIS LEGACY AND 
HAVING IT JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT 
AN UP STAYED MUCH STANDING 
INDIVIDUAL HE WAS AND HOW THEY 
THINK THEIR CHILDREN WILL LOOK 
UP TO SENATOR McCAIN AND THAT 
THEY TAUGHT HIM -- THEM ALL SO 
MUCH ABOUT HOW TO BE A GOOD 
PERSON. 
SOME OF HIS CHILDREN ACTUALLY 
CAME OUT IN TO THE ROTU NDA 
AFTER THE SHORT MEMORIAL 
SERVICE AND WERE SHARING 
STORIES ABOUT THEIR FATHER. 
WHAT TOUCHED THE CHILDREN IS 
THAT YOU COULD HEAR ON SOME OF 
THE AUDIO BECAUSE THERE WERE 
CAMERAS AROUND, WAS THAT THEY 
KEPT SAYING YOUR DAD WAS A 
GREAT MAN. 
THE CHILDREN WOULD SAY THANK 
YOU FOR COMING OUT. 
WE KNOW THAT IT'S VERY HOT AND 
THEY WOULD SAY OF COURSE WE 
WOULD DO THIS BECAUSE OF THE 
LEGACY OF YOUR FATHER. 
THAT THEY WERE JUST SO TOUCHED 
BY HIM. 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I 
THINK THERE'S BEEN A 
OUTPOURING. 
SENATOR McCAIN WAS NOT BORN 
HERE IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA 
BUT BECAME VERY MUCH SOMEONE 
THAT REALLY SHOWED WHAT ARIZONA 
MEANT TO THE PEOPLE HERE. 
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 
ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF SAFETY 
ESTIMATES THERE WERE 12 TO 
15,000 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
WHO FILED THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY 
ALONE. 
I WANT TO THANK JAMIE. 
>>> WE WANT TO GO NOW WITH SOME 
MOMENTS FROM THE MEMORIAL 
SERVICE AT THE BAPTIST CHURCH 
JUST A SHORT TIME AGO. 
>>  HE UNDERSTOOD ALL OF US 
WHETHER IT WAS WHITE, BLACK, 
BROWN, ASIAN, TO HIM IT DIDN'T 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 
WHAT HE KNEW IS THAT WE ALL 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 
WE ALL MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 
SO I HOPE THAT IN HIS LEGACY 
THE SENATORS, GOVERNORS, 
MAYORS, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, 
ELECTED OFFICIALS EMBRACE THE 
THOUGHT OF LOVE BECAUSE JOHN 
REFLECTED LOVE AND LOVE OF A 
STRONG MAN AND THAT IS NOWADAYS 
HARD TO COME BY. 
HE. 
>>  HE LOVED THIS PLACE. 
IF JOHN McCAIN FELL IN LOVE 
WITH ARIZONA,ARIZONA FELL IN 
LOVE WITH JOHN McCAIN. 
WE RAN A LOT OF RACES HERE. 
A LOT OF ELECTIONS. 
HE NEVER LOST. 
HE ARIZONA LOVED HIM. 
WE WILL MISS SO MANY THINGS 
ABOUT HIM
