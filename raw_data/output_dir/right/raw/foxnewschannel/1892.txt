00:00:01,406 --> 00:00:04,376
IRAN AND WE BEGIN WITH

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:06,378
JOHN ROBERTS ON THE MAJOR

3
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:07,446
MOVEMENT OF NORTH KOREA.

4
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:08,180
GOOD EVENING.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,781
>> AS HE WAS BOARDING

6
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:12,584
AIR FORCE ONE ON HIS WAY TO A

7
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:14,386
CAMPAIGN RALLY THIS AFTERNOON,

8
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:15,587
PRESIDENT TRUMP PREDICTED THAT

9
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:17,055
HIS PENDING SETTLEMENT WITH

10
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,156
NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN

11
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:21,426
WOULD BE A "GREAT SUCCESS."

12
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:23,128
THE CHANCES OF IT ACTUALLY

13
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:24,329
HAPPENING WERE GREATLY ENHANCED

14
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,565
BY THE FACT THAT NORTH KOREA

15
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:27,799
RELEASED THE THREE REMAINING

16
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:28,467
AMERICAN PRISONERS THAT THEY

17
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:33,205
WERE HOLDING.

18
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:35,607
IT WAS JUST AFTER 3:00 IN THE

19
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:37,876
MORNING THAT THE THREE AMERICANS

20
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:39,478
DID OBTAIN NORTH KOREA TOUCHED

21
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:42,547
DOWN IN JOINT BASE ANDREWS, THE

22
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:43,815
VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP,

23
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:44,549
AND THE FIRST LADY WERE ALL ON

24
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,552
HOME TO WELCOME THEM HOME.

25
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:48,253
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING IN

26
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,355
THIS COUNTRY.

27
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:52,591
>> THE GOODWILL GESTURE WAS

28
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:55,127
ENOUGH TO SEAL THE DEAL ON A

29
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,361
TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT.

30
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:58,230
THE PRESIDENTS WEEDING THE

31
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,097
HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MEETING

32
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:00,532
BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND MYSELF

33
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:02,567
WILL TAKE PLACE IN SINGAPORE ON

34
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:03,969
JUNE 12TH, WE WILL BOTH TRY TO

35
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,771
MAKE IT A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT

36
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:07,372
FOR WORLD PEACE.

37
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:09,975
THE DATE CARRIES HISTORIC

38
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:12,277
SIGNIFICANCE BRIDGE JUNE 12TH

39
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:13,612
1987 THAT RONALD REAGAN GAVE A

40
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:15,347
SPEECH IN WEST GERMANY.

41
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,549
A SPEECH THAT SET THE STAGE FOR

42
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,217
THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION.

43
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:22,921
>> MR. GORBACHEV TEAR DOWN THIS

44
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:24,323
WALL.

45
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:26,425
>> WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THE

46
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:28,360
CHOICE OF JUNE 12TH WAS SIMPLY A

47
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,760
COINCIDENCE.

48
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,365
BUT AS PRESIDENT REAGAN FOUND,

49
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:34,099
PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES THAT

50
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,867
KIM JONG UN WILL WANT TO CHOOSE

51
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:36,535
A PATH OUT OF ISOLATION.

52
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:38,203
>> I REALLY THINK THAT HE WANTS

53
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:38,937
TO DO SOMETHING.

54
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:41,573
I THINK THAT HE DID THIS BECAUSE

55
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,942
HE REALLY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING,

56
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:45,010
AND BRING THE COUNTRY INTO THE

57
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,945
REAL WORLD.

58
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:49,147
>> IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP HIM

59
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:51,183
MOVING TOWARDS THE BARGAINING

60
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:53,218
TABLE, DROPPING THE HARSH

61
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:55,187
RHETORIC OF LITTLE ROCKET MAN,

62
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,722
GOING SO FAR TO PRAISE HIM FOR

63
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:59,358
RELEASING THE DETAINEES.

64
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:02,060
>> I WANT TO THANK KIM JONG UN

65
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,532
WHO REALLY WAS EXCELLENT TO WITH

66
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,167
THE THREE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.

67
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:12,270
>> THE COMPLEMENT BROUGHT SHARP

68
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,938
CRITICISM FROM THE SENATE

69
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:13,405
MINORITY LEADER.

70
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:14,973
>> THE EXULTATION OF THE

71
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:17,275
GREATNESS OF NORTH KOREA DOING

72
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,945
THIS EVADES ME.

73
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:22,147
WE CANNOT BE FOOLED INTO GIVING

74
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:25,550
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME CREDIT.

75
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,752
FOR RETURNING AMERICANS THAT

76
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:28,186
NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DETAINED

77
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:29,554
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

78
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,189
>> IN RESPONSE TO CHUCK SCHUMER,

79
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,358
THE HOUSE SPEAKER SAID, GIVE THE

80
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,626
PRESIDENT A BREAK.

81
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:37,362
>> HE IS PREPARING FOR A SUMMIT

82
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:38,330
WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA

83
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:45,570
TO FOCUS ON DENUCLEARIZATION.

84
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,373
WE SHOULD GIVE HIM SOME LEEWAY.

85
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,742
>> WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKED

86
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:53,278
THE IDEA OF THE DMZ WHERE KIM

87
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:55,147
AND SOUTH KOREA'S

88
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:55,947
PRESIDENT MATZ, SINGAPORE WAS

89
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:57,783
ALWAYS THE FIRST CHOICE OF THE.

90
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:59,918
CLOSE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO GET TO

91
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,887
WITH THE LIMITED FLEET OF

92
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:06,525
AIRCRAFT AT THE NEUTRAL

93
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:07,826
TERRITORY.

94
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:09,327
A CITY RENOWNED FOR EXCELLENT

95
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:09,761
SECURITY.

96
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:13,265
>> JUST ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE

97
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:16,368
THE SUMMONS, SINGAPORE HOSTS AN

98
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:16,968
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY

99
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,136
CONFERENCE WHERE DELEGATES COME

100
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:20,772
FROM ALL OVER THE INDO PACIFIC

101
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:23,041
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES TO

102
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,009
TALK ABOUT MUTUAL SECURITY

103
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:24,309
NEEDS.

104
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,011
SO I THINK THAT IT MAKES A LOT

105
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:26,845
OF SENSE.

106
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:30,315
IT IS AN IDEAL LOCATION.

107
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:32,517
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD HIS EYE

108
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:33,552
ON DOMESTIC ISSUES TODAY,

109
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:35,921
SPECIFICALLY THE FARM BILL IN

110
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,122
THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING TODAY

111
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:39,090
WITH THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY

112
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,759
SONNY PURDUE, PAT ROBERTS OF

113
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,327
KANSAS, AND MIKE CONAWAY.

114
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,129
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE

115
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:44,896
EXPECTS WHEN THE LANGUAGE OF THE

116
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:48,166
BILL IS DRAFTED THAT IT WILL

117
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,234
INCLUDE MEASURES THAT WOULD

118
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,169
REQUIRE WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

119
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,137
ON FOOD STAMPS.

120
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,405
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE

121
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:55,207
EXPECTS SAID TO BE IN THE

122
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,075
LEGISLATION, HE STOPPED SHORT OF

123
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,310
ISSUING WHAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE

124
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,347
A VETO TREND.

125
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:04,249
>> Bret: THERE IS A STORY IN

126
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,151
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" HEADLINED

127
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:08,720
NORTH SECURITY CLOSE TO

128
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,722
RESIGNING AFTER TRUMP BERATED

129
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:12,924
HER AND TALKS ABOUT AN INCIDENT,

130
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:13,558
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT?

131
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:16,361
>> WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IN

132
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,762
THE CABINET MEETING YESTERDAY, I

133
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:19,964
HAVE CONFIRMED THIS THROUGH

134
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:20,932
SOURCES, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN FELT

135
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:23,034
LIKE SHE WAS SINGLED OUT AND

136
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:26,004
PARADED BY THE PRESIDENT OVER

137
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,473
WHAT HE SAW AS A LACK OF BORDER

138
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:29,007
SECURITY.

139
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,408
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT SAYS

140
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,010
THAT SHE WAS CLOSE TO RESIGNING

141
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,313
OVER IT AND THAT SHE HAD DRAFTED

142
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:36,948
A LETTER OF RESIGNATION.

143
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:38,650
WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM SOURCES

144
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,785
AT DHS IS THAT A TWEET WILL BE

145
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:42,120
COMING SOON.

146
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,888
THAT WOULD DENY THE EXISTENCE OF

147
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:45,156
A RESIGNATION LETTER.

148
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:46,758
IT MAY BE THAT SHE WAS SAYING

149
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,226
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF WELL,

150
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,928
IF I'M NOT DOING A GOOD JOB,

151
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,496
MAYBE I SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS

152
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:51,930
JOB.

153
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,765
BUT AS FAR AS DRAFTING A FORMAL

154
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:54,533
RESIGNATION LETTER, THAT APPEARS

155
00:04:54,533 --> 00:00:00,000
TO NOT BE THE CASE AT LEAST
