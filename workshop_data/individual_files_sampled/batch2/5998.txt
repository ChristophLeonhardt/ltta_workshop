welcome to the new normal when in a single news cycle the triple threats to Donald Trump's presidency are all on full display his lies about hush money paid to a pornstar the investigation into possible collusion with Russia and his strategy to protect himself in the Russia investigation by slimming career law enforcement and Justice Department officials up in flames today with explosive new reporting from the New York Times about the lengths that the FBI and Justice Department went to to keep secret the counterintelligence investigation into Trump Associates during the campaign we start with that breaking news first revealed in the president's financial disclosure form the office of government ethics saying that a payment made in 2016 by President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen to an adult film actress should have been included on the president's financial disclosure form last year the president's most recent disclosure released today shows a payment to Michael Cohen of between one hundred and two hundred and fifty thousand dollars the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani was the first to admit that payments made to Cohen to repay him for things like that hush money to stormy Daniels were quote funneled from Trump through Cohen's law firm to Cohen himself as reimbursement what started as a defense against campaign finance violations may have landed the president in ethical hot water the New York Times reporting quote a letter accompanying the report sent to rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General from the government ethics offices acting director David R poll said that the office of government ethics had determined quote the payment made by Cohen is required to be reported as a liability MSNBC analyst Joyce Vance putting a finer point on it saying looks like a campaign finance violation of lipstick you put on the pig Walter Shaw of the former director of OGE tweeting quote this is tantamount to a criminal referral OGE has effectively reported the president to DOJ for potentially committing a crime joining us to discuss the newse attorney michael avenatti who represents stormy Daniels were also joined by Frank Fiddler's II former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence New York Times political reporter Nick confessori and former US attorney Barbara McQuade first your reaction to the breaking news today that the president has potentially been referred to Deputy Attorney General Rosen Stein for committing a crime well Nicole the fact of the matter is is that these folks can't get their stories straight and they can't figure out what they want to do what they should be doing is telling the truth and they should have told the truth a long time ago I mean this disclosure today proves the following Michael Cohen has been lying to the American people for months David Schwartz the individual who came on national television repeatedly on many networks and stated that the president never reimbursement that reimbursed the payment and knew nothing about it lying to the American people mr. Giuliani as recently as a week ago has been lying to the American people about how this occurred and when it occurred because according to the disclosure today it occurred back in 2017 mr. Trump lied to the American people when he was on board Air Force One on video and stated that he knew nothing about the payment so this disclosure today completely undercuts all of that to begin with and then secondly it creates significant problems as to why this wasn't disclosed last year it appears to be part of the continued cover-up relating to what the president knew and when he knew it and what he did about it and I don't believe we still don't have the truth as to those questions and it's going to be some time until we do whether that's in response to a deposition or a sworn statement by mr. Trump in response to mr. Muller or whether it's going to be in response to a deposition by me you have maintained that you believe you will arrive at a point in your case where you will have an opportunity to depose the president does today's news change your belief that that is ultimately what will transpire between you and the president well I think it actually adds additional fuel to the fire the burning fire as to whether we're going to get a chance to do that because every time another piece of information comes out that further undercuts other statements that have been made over the last six months I think the chances of us taking that deposition of having an opportunity for that deposition only grow high and I think that's where we are this afternoon let's let's just lay it all out there you exploded onto the scene after a little story about in the Wall Street Journal of all raging liberal media outlets published a story about the Treasury Department and a financial institution flagging a suspicious payment you've since released reports about suspicious activity report stars your central contention at the beginning was that the contract that that that prohibited your client from speaking out about what she had encountered or dealt with with with the president was null and void because it wasn't signed just take us through how today's development relates to the the original case and and some of the fact pattern from from the original filing of your case to get stormy Daniels out of the NBA to the revelation today and the disclosure from the president that he was indeed the person repaying Michael Cohen the hush money for your client well very often in a case you begin to pull on a string and you don't necessarily know what that is gonna result in and I do really not know well we had a pretty good idea of what some of the things that some of the dominoes that might fall but you know we look we've we've had the good fortune at having mr. Trump on the other side of this case and the great fortune of having mr. Julian Giuliani on the other side and the extreme great fortune of having mr. Cohen on the other side of this case and they've done us a lot of good along the way and have helped out tremendously every time they go on television and make a statement that they know to be false that only assists us and what we did know was that the denial by mr. Cohen that mr. Trump his statement that mr. Trump knew nothing about this and that mr. Trump never reimbursed it we knew that that was ultimately going to be proven to be nonsense do you so I think we have that video of the president denying that on Air Force One do we have that let's watch that sohyun watch that in real time knowing that he was lying yeah and I think I said at the time that I knew that that was going to prove to be false and you have the president United States on board Air Force One on video making known misstatements the American people according to the disclosure today those reimbursements in fact all occurred well prior to that they all occurred in the year 2017 this is in April of this year and look this is all part of a concentrated cover-up relating to this payment relating to essential consultants and sooner or later these folks are either going to come clean voluntarily or they're going to be outed by us and others as it relates to the true facts and let me let me also put up Rudy Giuliani as you said seem to make things worse for the president when he talked about funneling money from the president United States to various women and he had a son that still doesn't match up with what was disclosed on today's forum let's see if we have Rudy Giuliani talking about funneling money sorry I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know it's not campaign money no campaign finance violation so they funneled it through the law firm son Rosen law firm and the president repaid it oh I didn't know that he did that's my favorite part it's my favorite part of the whole year actually so far but let me ask you because we've talked about I've asked you other women have come forward Associates of the President do not believe that there's only one stormy Daniels luckily for them there's only one of you but they believed that there were many such arrangements and and Rudy Giuliani seem to believe that when talking about something that has clearly in rudy giuliani's mind been operationalized the funneling of money doesn't sound like something that happens once it sounds like an operation meant to keep the president's embarrassing secret secret do you are you currently representing anyone else or do you have any evidence that there are still things that are not true about the financial disclosure form filed today we are not technically representing anyone else at this time but I will tell you that I believe this to be the tip of the iceberg and among other things I will state that I think it was David Schwartz on Megan ellee's show sometimes some time ago that said that Michael Cohen's job was to be a 24-hour seven-day-a-week fixer for the president and to clean things up well you don't need a 24/7 fixer unless you're breaking a lot of things breaking a lot of things including a lot of laws Frank yeah so let's put this today's revelation on the financial disclosure in context there's basically three scenarios two of them are really bad for the president and one strains credulity the first one is that the president is telling the truth you know anything about the payments he's a good guy he wanted to pay Michael back so he's done that Giuliani he's actually nixed that because he said the president knew that Michael takes care of such things so that's problem scenario number two the president knew about the payments knew that there were illegalities underlying the payments money-laundering emoluments Clause fictitious corporations and decided to pay him back anyway that makes him an accessory after the fact scenario number three he didn't know there were illegalities involved but he knew it later and he paid him back that makes him a co-conspirator he's in trouble today Barbara McQuade let me get you to jump in pick up Frank's thread I'd like to know if you agree with that assessment and then add in the wrinkle of Rod Rosenstein having another political time bomb ticking in his inbox yeah so these financial disclosure forms are filed under penalty of perjury and so if last year's financial disclosure forms should have included this statement there's there's that possibility I don't know how frequently these cases are actually prosecuted prosecutors exercise a lot of discretion and make decisions because you'd have to prove that the person knew the statement was false at the time they made it but it could lend credence to another theory which is this idea of consciousness of guilt that he knows that he's done something wrong and that's why he left it off the form in the past that could be a window into what's going on his mind which is often the hardest thing to prove so all those theories that Frank just talked about the hardest part of it is proving a corrupt intent but when someone lies on a financial disclosure form or lies to the press about something that can indicate this consciousness of guilt I've got something to hide and it's a much bigger crime than this this little I am telling right now and that seems to be the thread that runs through all of these investigation there's now been a referral the DOJ I imagine though whether they prosecuted or not as Barbara said is probably unknown unknown at this hour but there will at least be an investigation into putting these forms together things that were not true being put on these forms whether it was done so knowingly or not certainly in Jared Kushner's case he amended his background forms I have filled out those forms on two occasions and the meticulousness with which you you go back and try to remember every little thing in your life is unrecognizable in the way everyone from the President on down treats these these are in a normal administration crimes to lie on these forms but it seems like in some ways the least of their problems or is it well look the key question here for Trump is whether or at what time a koan and requested repayment so when the debt was incurred and which seems to be 2016 and then when it was actually paid so if he lied in the form it's a problem for him if he knowingly lie it's a big problem as we've discussed but for me and it raises the question of what else was omitted from that form if his if he leaves off a payment or a debt to his longtime advisor imagine the scope of things he might have left off that would be even more in communion or embarrassing for him and that's also unknown unknown or not known unknown but it could point the way to many other problems if investigators start delving closely into that form and what was on it and not on it you've got a crystal ball that that I don't know where you got it but I want a line on it that's what every guy says but but tell me if you know you you seem to have a jump sometimes on future damaging revelations about the president do you know any more than you're able to share today about other payments to other women or other people that were paid out to keep things that are embarrassing secret I have other information but I'm not at liberty to talk about it right now but I want to go back to and touch on something that was just discussed and that is how was the forum put together and I want to concentrate not on the forum that was just filed I want to go back in time to talk about the forum last year and how that was put together so let's back up in time and talk about that okay we're talking about May of last year when that forum was put together the president's been on off at that time probably four or five months let's talk about likely how that form was compiled they didn't just sit down with mr. Trump and say tell us all of your details and then fill out the form and have him sign it let's be realistic that's not what happened what happened was whoever was charged with compiling that information went to the people around mr. Trump that were close to him that would have knowledge of transactions assets liabilities expenditures and the like I find it very very difficult to believe that one of the people that was not consulted was mr. Cohen I find it impossible to believe that mr. Cohen would not have been consulted in connection with the compilation of the 2016 financial disclosure form and what this is really going to come down to is what did mr. Cohen as an agent of mr. Trump he's an attorney he's a personal attorney at present what did mr. Cohen tell whoever was compiling this form and what did he fail to tell them and what did he conceal from them as a related to liabilities and namely this stormy Daniels payment and that's going to be an area of inquiry and that's going to be really I think a center question as it relates to this 2016 forum and why this liability was not disclosed and let me ask you mr. Cohen isn't just an agent of the president's or his lawyer who likely had a role in putting that forum together last year he's also someone largely rumored to be facing very dire personal legal exposure right now is this the kind of thing that he might be willing to cooperate with to help investigators understand what was true and what was false in last year's financial disclosure form as part of any sort of arrangement for leniency for himself with investigators so I've worked organized crime figures I've worked high-level drug cartel leaders eventually they have a breaking point and I believe that Michael Cohen will eventually break when it's laid out for him the federal sentencing guidelines all the exposure he has the ramifications on his family he will eventually break and what will he tell us what kinds of things as an FBI agent would you want to know you know what what interests me that most is we're asking this question and you know what Donald Trump is asking a similar question do you know why he doesn't know what Michael Cohen documented in his office right if if the president doesn't use emails then what is it that Michael Cohen does after he hangs up the phone or meets with the president how much of this is memorialized the president doesn't know it and we don't know it but this is going to get into money laundering foreign power influence of the campaign back to AT&T and Novartis and a South Korean government subsidized aerospace company all of this and that key is the knowledge the guilty knowledge the President of the United States had of any of this let me give you the last word here Barbara on the legal side of this and let me ask you if Michael Cohen is facing as dire of a picture as Frank just painted as Nick and his colleagues have reported as Michael's been talking about for weeks as is as is sort of known to be his current predicament how dangerous is he to the president right now well I guess we don't know completely but potentially extremely dangerous because he was his lawyer for so many years I think as a prosecutor you would want to get your arms around all of the contents of the office search that was done to see what you can find there and of course he hasn't been charged with any crimes at all yet but if he is and he's facing exposure of 10 or 15 years in prison or you know even a day in prison he will have a strong incentive to cooperate and he likely know it was a lot about financial transactions any fraud or public corruption but most importantly he was out there communicating with Russians with Felix aider with trying to put up a trunk tower in Moscow and so the real heart of the matter relating to links between Russia and the Trump campaign is potentially known by Michael Cohen and so if he faces lengthy prison term it seems that he will have a strong incentive to provide that information and you hope in terms of just being persuaded that telling the truth is the right thing to do at the end of the day let me give you the last word on today's development and let me ask you if you think the president revealed this because there is more if you think the president revealed what he revealed on his disclosure to try to turn the page on your client in your case I think the president disclosed this on the form because he realized at this juncture based on advice of the people around him that he was left with no other choice but to disclose it on the form today and I've said it before I'm I said again Michael Cohen will lead to the downfall of this president he will not serve out his term all right Michael and I thank you so much for joining us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
