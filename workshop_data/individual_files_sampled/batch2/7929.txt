both Turkish investigators and the New York Times separately did an investigation to look into the 15 Saudi officials who arrived to the Saudi consulate in Turkey on chartered flights and what they did was find evidence that a lot of these officials are actually very closely tied to the Saudi royals so to give you some examples let's go to graphic five one of the suspects identified by Turkey in the disappearance of the Saudi dissident Khashoggi was a frequent companion of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman three others are linked by witnesses and other records to the Saudi crown prince's security detail and a fifth is a forensic doctor who holds senior positions in the Saudi interior ministry and medical establishment he has done extensive work and has published writings in regard to dissection and mobile autopsies and it's curious that he would show up with these Saudi officials to the Saudi consulate in Turkey also the presence among the suspects of an autopsy expert suggests that killing might have been part of the original plan and that's an important detail to keep in mind because the Saudis based on reports that were first done by CNN based on anonymous sources indicated that the Saudis were preparing to release a statement indicating that the Royals didn't know anything about this but the death of Khashoggi was a was the result of a botched interrogation now why was he being interrogated in the first place we don't know they haven't given us an answer and they haven't to be fair they haven't come out with that prepared statement yet and who knows if they really will but if they do plan on coming out that statement the identification of these officials would certainly go counter to whatever narrative they're trying to push so let's break down another part of this as we dissect if you will what happen here so we know parts of the deal already so the three governments turkey senator bin and the US are making a deal and then they're all gonna lie to you we all know what happened you Anna just laid it out for you guys they're clearly from the highest levels of the government they clearly brought murder weapons to Turkey they stayed for one day it was a hit team it's now with all the exhaustive reporting on it there's no question left and so the only question left is what's the secret deal in order to do the cover-up the Saturday area is not gonna come out and say yeah we dismembered him because we're monsters and America is not gonna say in Donald Trump has said it a million times well I like the money they're giving me I liked 110 billion dollar deal that we have with them I like the that they give me money for my apartments etc etcetera so he's not gonna turn around and say okay I'm done with the Saudis that's never gonna happen so we know so far what the Saudis are gonna get they're gonna get a cover-up that's very important to them because they got a huge economic summit coming up and they want outside investors into the country and they can't have it if we have sanctions against them if we sever our relationship so they're gonna get get to maintain the relationship and they're gonna get a cover now we know what the US has gotten so far the Saudis has sent a hundred million dollars to the u.s. in order to help with Syria okay so that's just a bride and then the u.s. also that's something from Turkey they got pastor Brunson which Turkey was holding and they say that's a coincidence obviously it's not the only thing we don't know yet is what is Turkey gonna get in the deal cuz they're the ones who have the evidence that's right and they just sent in that forensic team into the console and they say they've got DNA instead of their audio recordings and what they're holding out for is I could release the audio recording so why didn't they release it yet right as they're holding it in their back pocket for leverage right and that team they're gonna have the evidence from that team so if we're right about this and I guarantee you that we are whether it's public or not soon turkey will get a gigantic price from Saudi Arabia okay and so that's how this deal is done and Donald Trump will bless it all and everybody will go on in their merry lives except for of course the people who were murdered that the person in this case is khashoggi and enough obviously his family members will be outraged meanwhile let's also note the hypocrisy of Donald Trump during the campaign he said I cannot believe that the Clinton Foundation is taking money from the Saudis while he had been taking money from the Saudis for decades right in the form of deals and you know just business dealings and one other thing I wanted to quickly mention if all of that wasn't evidence enough for you the identification of all these Saudi officials there was one other important piece of evidence that was outlined in The Times piece and it talked about those two private planes or jets so records show that to private jets chartered by a Saudi company with close ties to the Saudi Crown Prince and interior ministry arrived and left Istanbul on the day of mr. Khashoggi disappearance so that's yet another piece of evidence I think it's become abundantly clear what really happened to him and what I am curious about is whether or not the Republicans who have gone on the record to criticize the Saudis are going to now backtrack and pretend like this is all okay and nothing really happened they will and that leads us to the last part of the puzzle okay there's a fourth country that no one talks about it is not you're not allowed to talk about it it's talked about in code words and that's Israel so wait what do they have to do with it well Trump talked about well the Saudis help us with Iran now we had a perfectly good deal with Iran and the rest of the world did in ending their nuclear program etc Trump ripped that up but right now we don't have any open hostility with Iran but Israel does Israel hates and understandably so that they fund Hezbollah and Hamas which works against Israel so Israel and and this is all public knowledge and Netanyahu is gone in the United Nations has come to the US and say Israel's are taking time bomb I'm sorry Iran is a ticking time bomb and America you have to attack you have to attack you have to attack Iran right so when they say Iran well that's a code word in Washington for be cool Israel says Saturday Arabia is okay because they work with us against Iran okay and that Mike Pompeo said this that Anna referred to a little bit earlier in the show I could go on about the places that the Saudis in the u.s. are working together to make sure that and that we the US needs to be quote make sure that we're mindful of that what do you mean the places that the Saudis in the US are working together and that how everybody should be mindful of that you know what that means that means hey everybody be cool it remember Israel's allies with Saudi Arabia and together they're fighting against Iran so that's your code words now if I am right what will happen with those tough guy Republican senators Lindsey Graham Marco Rubio are two notable critics of what's been going on with Saudi Arabia those two make a little bit more noise and then by a week later all of a sudden it'll die down and there'll be no more talk of sanctions or ending our relationship or stopping the funding of the war in Yemen this Saudi Arabia is doing all of a sudden all those tough guys will melt away because they should be mindful of where the Saudi Arabia and us are working together wink and if I'm wrong they won't they'll be Lions and they'll come out and so far they've been strong and we're giving them credit for that if I'm wrong they'll continue and they'll say no we demand that you end a relationship and they'll take congressional action good luck let's see if I'm right or wrong that's why I love telling you at a time and I'll tell you right now they ain't gonna take no congressional action they're going to be mindful of what certain allies want them to do on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT comm slash podcast
