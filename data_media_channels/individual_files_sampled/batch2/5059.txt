begin with breaking news from Buffalo New York that is where congressman Chris Collins is expected to speak any minute now about his arrest today cons of course was the first member of Congress who actually endorsed Donald Trump for president back in 2016 he also then served as the congressional liaison to the Trump transition team he is now facing charges of insider trading and lying to the FBI in an indictment that totaled 30 pages the government alleging that Collin's tipped his son off about a failed drug test at a biotech company in a immunotherapy X where the congressman served on the board of directors family and friends then sold their stock in the company before the news broke saving them more than seven hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars in losses this morning the US attorney for the Southern District of New York noted that no one is above the law as he laid out the charges against the congressman congressman Collins cheated our markets and our justice system these charges are a reminder that this is a nation of laws and that everybody stands equal before the bar of justice now Collins has pleaded not guilty to the charges in a statement his lawyer said quote we are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated in the meantime have speaker Paul Ryan called for a prompt and thorough investigation said Collins will no longer be serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee according to the indictment Collins was actually on white house grounds at a congressional picnic when he received word about that failed drug test for more on all of this I am joined by Lauren Emmaus New York political reporter for Politico Paul Butler a former federal prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst and Jason Johnson politics editor for The Root calm Lord just let me the backstory here in terms of the basics of what's being alleged this is sort of an insider trading deal here it seemed to come out of nowhere today was there any hint that something like this was coming absolutely the congressman had actually been under investigation by the Office of Congressional ethics for a while now we didn't know that federal prosecutors were looking at this and they wouldn't say exactly how the case was referred to them or how they picked it up but the news about his stock trades and the news about his making recommendations to other members of Congress to buy stock in this company of which he was a member of the board has been public for for more than a year what does this case look like to you pause a as a prosecutor taking a look at this what does it look like the government's put together here it looks like a slam dunk so this is a 30 page indictment that says that this man is the on the board and the largest shareholder in this pharmaceutical company he gets this bad news that its main product the trials haven't gone well basically the company is going to go out of business and so dudes out the White House he calls his son seven times saying sell the stock sell the stock when he when he gum finally gets in touch with the son apparently because the son does sell the stock his other friends comrades also sell their stock before the news is public again they save seven hundred thousand dollars this is a classic what you don't do if you have insider information you're not allowed to use it to benefit your boys we are waiting as we said we are expecting to hear from the congressman Chris Collins we are expecting to hear from him out in Buffalo New York any minute now you're looking at the podium there it's all set up this thing has already been delayed a little bit from what was planned so we're gonna see what he has to say what kind of statement he puts together again his lawyer out there saying he's gonna be vindicated he enters the plea of not guilty I want to ask you this Paul though he's got an office he's a member of Congress it is this a situation is that a potential bargaining chip with prosecutors for somebody in his position is there a situation here as this happened where basically there's an agreement to give up the seat to give up the office in exchange for leniency of some sort you know it's a bargaining chip if you actually have something that the prosecutor wants so this guy's up for re-election in November so that's significant in part because the prosecutor is bringing the case now probably because the Justice Department has this 60-day rule 100 day rule you don't bring charges within length of an indictment because it might affect the election so president crops got to be keeping his eye on this all they'll also be concerned about the US Attorney saying US Attorney who's investigating Michael Cohen US Attorney says today if you're a high official and you abuse the public trust we take that very seriously again not good news for president Trump yeah in Jason I mean the name Chris Collins that you know if you're a close political watch or you know somebody watching this network you've certainly seen him over the last couple years first Republican to endorse Donald Trump first Republican member of Congress who did that back in 2016 had that role with the transition so there is certainly some prominence there I think a lot more people learning about him tonight for the first time but in terms of the midterms we are just a couple months away Democrats are running on this message of you know it's time to sort of clean house there eat in the house does this factor into what Democrats are trying to say in terms of a message this November definitely Steve Lee this is the worst unforced error possible I mean I always thought that the only thing that could stop the Democrat success this fall would be a party wide scandal individual members of Congress can get in trouble all the time it doesn't necessarily matter that becomes a local issue but Collins is not only caught for being sort of a swamp creature and using insider trading to make himself rich he's connected to Trump and he told several other members so in the process of this investigation this may connect to four or five six seven other members of Congress that he may have delivered this information to it could take all of them out and this is the sort of party wide scandal that is going to have an impact this fall this is this is just mana from heaven for the Democrats right now and Republicans need to be really concerned and many of them are probably calling their broker right now well it is interesting too if you think that the last time Democrats picked up the house from Republicans in 2006 one of the issues that powered them that year there were a series of corruption scandals many of about Republican members of Congress there the Democrats certainly harnessed that year as Laura was saying a minute ago this not the first time Collins trading practices have been reported on in January of last year Jake Sherman from Politico wrote overheard in the capital New York representative Chris Collins talking loudly into a phone just off the House floor bragging about how many millionaires made in Buffalo in the last month he was bragging about a stock tip he had shared with people I mean the word that was used here at this press conference ball was brazen we're hearing about the White House picnic we're hearing about just off the House floor all of this stuff is going on within the earshot of some pretty powerful influential people we're hearing about a high-level politician the people's representative who apparently believes he's above the law he's hiding in plain sight he's flagrantly violating the law and apparently believes he's not going to get caught well today he got his comeuppance tell us Laura about his reputation before all of this today his reputation as a politician Buffalo area you know western New York we say first Trump supporter the district he's from is one of those districts that really swung toward Trump in 2016 Chris Collins the politician what's his reputation there well the district was redrawn in 2012 and it was made more conservative and he's reasonably well-liked up in his own district but I'll tell you who doesn't like him is Governor Andrew Cuomo the Democratic governor of New York Chris Collins was rumored to be considering a run for governor in the past couple of cycles the governor and Chris Collins have gotten into fights over Medicaid funding so that's one person who I think is is happy to see the news today or at least plotting something in response in columns arrests could also we talked about the political implications here another way it could play into the hands of Democrats heading into November as political rights Democrats have tried to find ways to paint House Republicans as the creat creatures of the Washington swamp there's that term again corrupt political figures who are taking advantage of their station in public life Democrats seem to be getting handed that theme on a silver platter Jason you were just talking about that the other thing to look at here though look we just were talking last night about this special election out in Ohio or Demma is still officially too close to call not sure the Democrats are actually going to pick that one up right now but Democrats trying to chip away at that number of 23 seats if they do they get the majority here's a district it was on nobody's radar in terms of being competitive this November I think Trump won this thing by 24 points in 2016 one of the reasons we're interested in this press conference right now is is cons about come out there and say hey folks I'm fighting the charges and I'm running for re-election I'm staying on the ballot and I'm staying in this race because even given how Republican in that district is we have seen politicians get jammed up like this and losing districts they otherwise would never lose it oh definitely this is this is the kind of last minute scandal that ends up waking up the opposition you know whatever the Democrat isn't like wait a minute here's my chance and if he decides to fight it well here's what the problem is Steve this becomes part of the overall noise about this administration you've got mana Ford you've got his assistants you've got all of these people you've got three or four guys running a cabal running the VA all of this sounds like just sort of politicians gone wild and Washington DC and this is not the kind of thing that Republicans need to be battling as they're also trying to keep their messages separate from Trump this has the potential to be as big as the house banking scandal which pretty much costs the Democrats the house in the early 90s if this spreads if you've got several people coming forward and saying well I kind of got information from him but I didn't but I didn't make that much money this has the opportunity to drag down several Republicans regardless of what the Democratic candidates are that they're gonna be facing this fall well yeah Paul it is that sort of a cryptic Specter there of other members of Congress so what you look at this indictment today you look at what you heard from the prosecutors what is the the metastatic potential of this in terms of other members being brought in and so Collins himself apparently has no defense what his lawyers have said so far as well he didn't actually make any money from this insider information yes his his son did yes his future of son-in-law did Archie is his fiancee's father made money but not him that's not a legal defense and so the prosecutor will be interested in what he knows what Collins knows about other Congress people if he tipped them off and if they he illegally benefited from this information and of course long shot but if he knows anything about President Trump he was the first Congress person to endorse him we can expect Trump to pull what we could call Papadopoulos or mana for meaning Trump will go congressman Collins who he was my coffee boy know him but if that's not true love Collins that's got any goods on the president again that's a stretch but if he does that's bargaining power for Collins and hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click
