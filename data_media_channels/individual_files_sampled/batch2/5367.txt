well a prominent member of the White House staff was actually found guilty of breaking the law today and that's a sentence that you hear once a decade maybe at best it's supposed to be shocking in the United States it's actually supposed to be earth-shattering news that someone working in the White House has broken the law but today it's a story that is drowning it's disappearing amidst all the other White House madness including the resignation today of Gary Cohn as president as president Trump's chief economic adviser that's the announced resignation and the aftermath of yesterday's media madness from former Trump political adviser Sam Nunn Berg who in one report is now blaming his public defiance of the special prosecutor yesterday on drugs and alcohol the latest nunberg update indicates that he will indeed obey the subpoena compelling him to testify to a grand jury on Friday after which he will immediately seek treatment we don't know who will be left working in the White House on Friday because we never know and because the Trump White House staffers have a habit of announcing their resignations which might or might not be resignations and might or might not be firings and then hanging around the office for days or weeks the whole pix resignation or firing whatever that was was announced last week but there is no indication of when she will actually vacate the office of director of communications just as there is no indication of exactly when Gary Cohen will actually really finally leave his job in the White House might be two weeks from now and given what we know about the ethical standards of the Trump White House which are the lowest since the Nixon White House Kellyanne Conway will still be at her desk in the White House on Friday but will probably still be doing absolutely nothing for the American taxpayers who pay her salary because she has no actual governing duties in the White House and Kelly and Conway will probably continue to break the law the u.s. office special counsel police's among other things the official conduct of federal government employees it is a permanent office that has nothing to do with the current special prosecutor Robert Muller who's investigating the Trump White House the office official counsel announced today that they quote sent an investigative report to President Donald Trump finding that counselor to the president Kellyanne conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews and those two TV interviews Kelly and Conway who was appearing in her official capacity urged the defeat of Democratic candidate for Senate in Alabama Doug Jones and that is a clear violation of the Hatch Act which as the Special Counsel puts it quote restricts employees from using their official government position for partisan political purposes including by trying to influence partisan elections the White House reaction today to the Office of Special Counsel is 11 page report detailing and proving that Kellyanne Conway violated the law was simply to say we don't believe it this is the second time a White House employee has been found in violation of the Hatch Act the first was dance Covino the White House director of social media the Office of Special Counsel is not empowered to discipline White House staffers who violate the Hatch Act that discipline is left to the President and of course President Trump has no discipline himself and imposes no discipline on anyone else working in the chaos White House the Trump White House has staffers who break the law and get caught then nothing happens to them it has a communications director who co-wrote hugely complimentary White House statements about her boyfriend after her boyfriend was exposed as having been accused of domestic violence by both of his previous wives it has a chief of staff who bombastically and angrily lied about a black woman member of Congress got caught in those lies and refused to apologize for those lies and after lying about congresswoman Frederica Wilson John Kelly actually went so far as to say he had nothing to apologize for and no member of the White House staff has ever been caught publicly lying more wildly more recklessly than John Kelly did in that case but it's the Trump White House and working in the Trump White House means never having to say you're sorry not for lying not for lying about a woman not for lying about a black woman member of Congress and so from from the top down from Donald Trump through John Kelly and his predecessor Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer and Steve Mann and the director of social media all the way down to Kellyanne Conway who has no known function in the White House the whole team participates in and contributes to lying and chaos every single day because Donald Trump attacks and hires the very worst people for those jobs I have the most dedicated people I have the best people I have the best people that was one of the many lies that Trump voters fell for even when he was surrounded on the presidential campaign by the least professional least experienced presidential campaign operatives in history today now that he has proven the opposite Donald Trump tried telling that lie again and I read where oh gee maybe people don't want to work for Trump but believe me everybody wants to work in the White House they all want a piece of that Oval Office they want a piece of the West Wing and not only in terms of it looks great on their resume it's just a great place to work so many people want to come in I have a choice of anybody I could take any position in the White House and I'll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position everybody wants to be there and they love this White House because we have energy like rarely before joining us now Tim O'Brien the executive editor of Bloomberg view and the author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald he's an MSNBC contributor also joining us McKay Coppins staff writer for the Atlantic magazine and author of the wilderness deep inside the Republican Party's combative contentious chaotic quest to take back the White House and McKay you are one of the first people who introduced me in a sense to Sam Nunn Berg first read about him in your reporting long before this week but you have written what I think is the the definitive piece on what Sam Nunn Berg was up to yesterday and in my reading of it if I was to give these short executive summary of it it seems you were saying this is just the way he is I think that's basically right you know as he was after taking this you know manic media blitz yesterday there were all these theories about what was happening and was he suffering from some kind of personal breakdown was he you know did he have some kind of calculated angle that he was playing you know there were obviously a lot of reports about alcohol abuse or drugs or was he drinking but the thing about Sam Nunn Burke I've known him for many years I've been kind of dealing with him in various ways as a journalist this is this is really what he's like this is his MO he's he kind of studied under the tutelage of Roger stone the notorious Republican operative and has always seen politics in some sense as performance art for its own sake as Roger stone once said he really loves the attention he loves the political stunts this showmanship and when I talked to Nonnberg last night he was out essentially celebrating his day of non-stop media attention he thought it was a great day for him and Mackay I don't want to dwell and send Nunn work too much other than to illustrate just how Donald Trump in fact doesn't have the best people and will continue not to have the best people in the White House but he kept complaining yesterday about this this subpoena is so oppressive because he kept saying I have a life and he kept saying I have other work to do two questions does he in fact have a life and see have any other work to do at all has any is anyone paying him to do anything I bet he's getting paid from someone somewhere to do something I don't know I know that he spends a lot of time talking to TC reporters and trying to settle scores with the various rivalries that he or Roger stone or Steve Bannon have I I don't know what job he's doing that on any given day Tim O'Brien and McKay I want to take a look at something that is a copyrighted feature of the Rachel Maddow program the Rachel Maddow Show and this is Rachel's giant big board of the Trump administration departures which which appears sometimes every night sometimes every other night but with quiet with a great deal of frequency and and there's obviously every week there's something added to it and and Tim we have never seen we've never seen a graphic like that in any White House at this point that's kind of what that looks like at the end of four years the other thing to remember Lawrence is that he hasn't filled a large chunk of federal positions so the fact that they've got all of this outflow when they haven't even managed the inflow at this point really makes you wonder whose hand is on the rudder on the ship of state I think the other thing that's come up with the same number event is it is this reminder that Trump actually doesn't always attract the best people in fact he's rarely stocked his company or his administration with a-list talent he really can't afford to have people like Gary cone head for the exits because we now have a long list that includes people like Carter Page and Anthony scaramouche II and Sebastian Gorka and a whole series of other oh you know rodeo clowns who have certain who have has been this constellation of advisers surrounding Trump they don't give him good advice they're hitching their wagons to his star usually I think for their own short-term needs they get the attention they're they're looking for and then they're either incompetent and he needs to fire them or they move on and and the one to stay engaged with him like Michael Kohn also aren't offering top-flight advice we have a in Michael Kohn we have a Trump's personal lawyer who has a parent who apparently set out to help the president mask an alleged sexual relationship with a porn star and he fails actually to keep it covered up he makes various mistakes in the way he incorporates the LLC and and and handles the financial transactions so the president now has a scandal unrelated to Muller but equally problematic for him legally because yet another one of his advisers has let him down apparently Donald Trump is trying to switch this imagery from what Jimmy breslin's famous book title called the gang that couldn't shoot straight into Doris Kearns Goodwin Doris Kearns Goodwin concept of Abraham Lincoln's team of rivals in the cabinet let's listen to how the president talked about all the energy you get from all of these rivals in the White House it's got tremendous energy it's tough I like conflict I like having two people with different points of view and I certainly have that and then I make a decision but I like watching it I like seeing it and I think it's the best way to go I like different points of view McKay Coppins yeah he likes watching it he likes seeing it I wonder how much he likes seeing the Sam Nunn Berg version of the team of rivals on TV yesterday I can't imagine he enjoyed that but actually I have heard from people inside this administration who have said that the way that this president processes information is not by reading he doesn't read very much or at all but by obviously watches cable news but also what he likes to do is take two aides or staffers or allies and put them in a room and have them argue with each other about an issue and then he basically kind of goes on his own gut instinct about who won the debate and that's often how he makes decisions and processes information so it's not necessarily you know a terrible idea to stock his team with a team of rivals the problem is that the rival have to be ultimately competent and and able to get on the same page when the president makes a decision and we haven't seen that happening at all over the past year and the Tim there's a TV quality to what McKay just described I mean that really is the old crossfire format on the CNN show that I know Donald Trump remembers and so that's basically he's kind of booking a cable news show in the room with her well and that's how he ran the Trump Organization but we should remember that the Trump Organization was a boutique tiny operation it was not a fortune 500 company he had a small a handful of people who had been with him for decades and he ran that tiny thing by the seat of his pants it was not the federal government of the United States he's the President of the United States he's clothed in an immense power he has millions of people working for him he's got the nuclear arsenal at his disposal chaos theory doesn't work when you're the president of United States and it's ridiculous to see that to think that he's gonna get positive outcomes with us he had no experience running a large bureaucracy before he became came to the federal government and he's never built strong teams an inability to manage sophisticated processes and manage highly talented teams who actually are giving you advice you listen to and high-end feedback are not if they've never been part and parcel of his his own resume and they certainly haven't been hallmarks of this White House Tim O'Brien thank you for your valuable perspective on the history of Trump world and how things have worked and how they work today and McKay Coppins thank you for your invaluable contribution to our understanding of the nunberg affair really
