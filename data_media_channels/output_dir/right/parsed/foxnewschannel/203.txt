>> BREAKING TONIGHT, PRESIDENT
TRUMP SPEAKING OUT ON THE
MIDTERMS, RUSSIA, CHINA, THE
CRISIS OF SAUDI ARABIA IS IN US
LEADERS AND THE BRUTAL MURDER
LOVE A JOURNALIST.
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE
NEXT REVOLUTION.
THIS IS THE HOME OF POSITIVE
POPULISM.
WE'LL DISCUSS BREAKING NEWS FROM
THE PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING BY
LIFE.
PLUS, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP
ACCOMPLISHMENTS PILE UP, HIS
ENEMIES STILL SMEAR AND BELITTLE
THE BIG CHANGES THAT ARE BEING
ACHIEVED.
HE WITH ME FOR THAT ARE MORE ARE
TOMMY LAUREN, AND RAY.
FIRST LET'S GET TO THE BREAKING
NEWS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP INTERVIEW ON 60
MINUTES.
HE OFFERED A FIERCE DEFENSE OF
HIS ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON
NORTH KOREA, RUSSIA, TREY, AND
MORE.
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THEY PRESS FOR THE 2016
ELECTION.
>> WELL, THEY METAL BUT I THINK
CHINA METAL TWO.
>> WHY DO YOU THINK CHINA METAL?
>> I THINK CHINA METAL ALSO.
I THINK FRANKLY, CHINA IS A
BIGGER PROBLEM.
>> YOUR DIVERTING THE RUSSIAN
THING.
I'M SAYING RUSSIA BUT I'M ALSO
SEEING CHINA.
>> STEVE: CHINA.
AMONG OTHER THINGS THE PRESIDENT
SAID HE HAS NO PLANS TO SHUT
DOWN THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION AND
PREMISES PUNISHMENT TO SAUDI
ARABIA IF IT TURNS OUT THEY
MURDERED THE REPORTER.
MARCO RUBIO WAS OUT TODAY WITH A
STRONG MESSAGE.
>> NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH
CAREFULLY BUT IT NEEDS TO BE
STRONG, RECIPROCAL AND LIVE UP
TO THE LEVEL OF THE OUTRAGE AND
THE CRIMINALITY IF IN FACT THIS
IS PROVEN TO BE TRUE.
I'M GLAD THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
TIE HIS HANDS BUT IT NEEDS TO BE
STRONG AND MEANINGFUL.
IT CAN'T BE SYMBOLIC.
>> LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN.
WITH JASON.
JASON, THERE'S SO MUCH IN THERE.
I WANTED TO START ON THE SAUDI
SITUATION.
SEEMS TO ME THERE'S AN OBVIOUS
NARRATIVE BEING PUT FORWARD.
I WAS WATCHING ALL DAY AND THAT
IS THERE TRYING TO MAKE OUT THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SOMEHOW BEING
SOFT ON SAUDI ARABIA.
BECAUSE THERE'S FINANCIAL TIES
THERE'S COMPROMISE OVER THAT
WERE BEING USED.
THERE TRYING IT TREATED LIKE
RUSSIA.
HE LITERALLY SAID THERE WILL BE
SEVERE PUNISHMENT IF IT TURNED
OUT THIS HAPPEN.
I THINK IT'S RUSSIA ALL OVER
AGAIN.
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
JUMPED ON THIS WITHOUT KNOWING
ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT STRUCK THE
RIGHT TONE.
MARCO RUBIO IS RIGHT.
HAS TO BE MEASURED, CALCULATED,
PRECISE.
IT CAN'T BE SYMBOLIC OR AN
OVERREACH.
IT'S VERY SERIOUS SITUATION.
WE ARE ALSO FRIENDS WITH THE
SAUDI.
NEVERTHELESS, THIS BEHAVIOR IS
ABHORRENT, CANNOT BE STOOD FOR
AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A UNITED
STATES RESPONSE.
>> STEVE: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE SAID THAT RIGHT FROM THE WORD
GO.
THIS IS REALLY OUTRAGEOUS.
IT'S AS IF TO APPEAR HE'S BEING
SOFT ON A ROGUE REGIME.
I JUST WANTED TO SWITCH TO
ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THE
INTERVIEW.
THE GENERAL MATTIS ASPECT WHERE
HE BASICALLY SAID WE DON'T HAVE
TO CLICK THERE BUT THEY HAVE
SEEN IT I KNOW HE'S MIGHT GO,
HE'S BASICALLY A DEMOCRAT.
VERY POSITIVE ABOUT HIM BUT OPEN
TO THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE
LEAVING HIS CABINET.
>> GENERAL MATTIS AS WELL
REVERED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
AISLE.
THAT'S WHY HE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY
CONFIRMED.
HE HAS DONE A GREAT SERVICE FOR
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
SAD TO SEE HIM GO.
HE SERVED A FEW YEARS IN THAT
POSITION AND THEN MOVE ON.
I THINK HE'S BEEN STRONG AND A
GOOD LEADER.
IT'S HELPED US WITH NORTH KOREA,
IRAN AND A ROUND THE WORLD.
IT'S HELPED WITH THE FUNDING
THAT CONGRESS HAS UPPED TO GET
OUR MILITARY BACK IN STRENGTH
AFTER BEING DECIMATED BY THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
>> STEVE: HE SAW THE PRESIDENT
GETTING FIRED UP ABOUT THE WAY
HE WAS BEING PRESSED ON RUSSIAN
MEDDLING MAKING THE POINT THAT
CHINA HAS AS WELL.
IT'S INTERESTING THAT STORYLINE
OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING THEY
LITERALLY CAN'T MONICO EVEN
THOUGH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF
THAT.
IT STRIKING WAS ALMOST THE ONLY
THING HIS CRITICS IN THE MEDIA
AND ELSEWHERE CAN TALK ABOUT.
>> THERE'S NO WAY THAT LESLIE
STAHL WOULD'VE TREATED PRESIDENT
OBAMA THAT WAY.
ANYBODY WHO IS SERIOUS ABOUT
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON IN
THE CYBER WORLD UNDERSTANDS
CHINA'S A BIGGER THREAT.
NO DOUBT THAT RUSSIA IS A THREAT
AND THEY DID TRY TO METAL.
BUT THE CHINESE, DONALD TRUMP IS
RIGHT.
IF ANYBODY SERIOUS ABOUT
UNDERSTANDING CYBERSECURITY
UNDERSTAND CHINA HAS A BIG ROLE.
THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT AND I
THOUGHT LESLIE OVERSTEPPED HER
BOUNDS BY INTERRUPTING THE
PRESIDENT.
>> I AGREE ABOUT THAT.
ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVES FROM
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS THEY HAVE
REVERSED DECADES OF THE FAILED
CHINA POLICY AND HAVE GOTTEN
INCREDIBLY TOUGH.
IT'S A REALLY BIG
ACCOMPLISHMENT.
ONE LAST QUESTION, WITH YOUR
POLITICAL HANNAH I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE CRUCIAL MIDTERMS,
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT ALL STANDS
RIGHT NOW?
>> I THINK ENTHUSIASM IS THE
BIGGEST FACTOR IN THE LAST THREE
OR FOUR WEEKS OF AN ELECTION.
I THINK THE MOB RULE YOU SEE
HAPPENING FROM THE DEMOCRATS
TURNS OFF THE INDEPENDENTS AND
CENTRIST WHO WILL DETERMINE THE
ELECTION.
I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE GINNED
UP AFTER THEY SAW THE WAY JUDGE
KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED.
REPUBLICANS HAVE BAD ENERGY AND
DEMOCRATS ARE COMPELLING MOST
