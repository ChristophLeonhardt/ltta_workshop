the EU is insisting that the Iran nuclear deal remain unchanged the blocks of foreign policy chief made that announcement after talks in Brussels between UK France Germany and Iran that is despite Donald Trump pulling at the u.s. out of the agreement three months as as you know very well complex enough long enough detailed enough doesn't need to be changed modified or have any addition everything is already written there I hope to be able to make a deal with them a good deal a fair deal a good deal for them better for them better for them but we cannot allow them to have nuclear weapons in a press statement following the hours of negotiations the you foreign policy chief that the parties relevant to these talks have decided that they're going to keep working on the full implementation of the Iran nuclear deal that she called a diplomatic breakthrough in fact she compared the parties at the negotiation table having joked that this deal is relative that they all have that's in intensive care that they want to get out of the hospital and of course this comes in somewhat of the contradiction from signs we have seen from the US that have on one side said that they might be implementing sanctions against European countries if they continue to work with Iran is the u.s. prepared to go after companies in our allies like Britain France and Germany if they try to continue to do business the thankss regime that it's now in place is very clear about what the requirements are Europeans are going to face the effect of US sanctions already are really why would any business why would the shareholders of any business want to do business with the world's central bank or of international terrorism all of this comes with the United States having said that they're no longer seeing this deal as a good one and Trump announcing on May 8th that the u.s. does not want to be part of this deal any more and the concern here in Brussels and in Europe has been the way with which this could potentially affect the negotiator trade relationships between EU countries and of course Iran and it's been made clear that China Russia France Germany and Great Britain are committed to sticking to this deal that was first signed back in 2015 and came into force into 2016 and was seen as a major breakthrough given how many years it took to work out with the goal of course of lifting the punishing sanctions against Iran and in return getting the halting of its nuclear program that had been a concern for the Western world for so many years so now the plan here in Brussels is to continue working to ensure that this deal continues to function reporting from Brussels anastasiya Turkana for RT o European powers agreed to protect firms who suffer as a result of those sanctions but despite defending Iran the UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson earlier gave a very different message in the British Parliament might conceivably achieve regime change at some stage in the in the in the near future but I cannot I cannot in it with any confidence said that that would be a change for the better what the Americans seem to want to do is have what as if done in previous times in Iraq for instance has used sanctions to try and weaken the regime in order to bring about an agenda of regime change the Americans are really know policing the Europeans using the threat of sanctions to say no you're not going to do this you're not going to help Iran we are going to beggar the Iranian economy and hopefully bring down the Islamic Republic you
