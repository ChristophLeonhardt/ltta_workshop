now it is time for my smart glasses and the final thought college students have always acted like idiots since first causing trouble in 11th century Bologna even medieval University students were criticized for drunken debauchery and gambling and chasing women of ill repute in ignoring their studies and how god those bright college days I loved them so much the difference then of course and even until the past few years is that university administrators used to stop the kitties from pursuing their worst impulses there used to be adults in the room unfortunately today the generation that broke American academia in the 1960s are now running the show the lunatics are running the asylum and once great institutions of learning will continue to garner lower and lower returns and the students that attend them will garner lower and lower returns until the adults re-emerge to firmly defend order and rigor on campus with that I'm Michael Knowles's the my granola show come back tomorrow we'll do it all again you
