following Trump's announcement that the US Embassy in Israel would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel violence broke out in various parts of Israel including parts of the West Bank and Gaza now there were also protests in other countries countries that we have considered our allies and of course this is because of the fact that it has you know further made it impossible to create a peace deal between the Palestinians and the Israelis because this is a land that is something that it has religious meaning for both the Israelis and the Palestinians and this has kind of led to more of a division between both of them now the Palestinian Authority called for a general strike in Palestinian cities in Gaza the Islamist Hamas movement urged its followers to ignite a third intifada or uprising against Israel shops in Jerusalem's Old City were shuttered the State Department actually notified u.s. embassy employees throughout the world but especially in that region of the world to be careful they said that we expect there to be resistance to this news in the Middle East and around the world we are still judging the impact this decision will have on US facilities and personnel overseas and I wanted to read that statement for a second because I think it's so indicative of what you can expect from the Trump's administration we're gonna go ahead and make a very strong you know decision when it comes to something that's conflicted an issue that's very conflicted that's very difficult especially for that region of the world but we're just gonna make that decision without really analyzing the impact it's gonna have or the ramifications it's gonna have on not just the people living in that part of the world but also US personnel that are working in that part of the world well several advisors said that he did not seem to have the full understanding this is according to the Washington Post did not seem to have a full understanding of the issue and instead appeared to be focused on seeming quote simi pro-israel in the words of one and quote making a deal in the words of another so as usual of course he doesn't have any idea what he's doing he's like junk gonna be could do it when we could deal so he calls up for example king abdullah ii in jordan and that's a top ally of ours and you don't want to destabilize jordan because then israel will be in much worse shape if all you care about is israel first of all you should also care about other human beings but if all you care about is israel you do not want to destabilize jordan it is a rare country that is stable and and king abdullah there is a top ally of america and in a sense israel okay so abdullah says to him don't do it you're gonna destabilize us you're gonna strengthen radicals you don't want to strengthen radicals you want to strengthen moderates hey go so yeah but I wanted pure pro-israel and I and I'm gonna tell you why he actually did it in a second okay then Tillerson comes in and says if you do this we might have another Benghazi on our hands that's right yeah any guys who pretend to care about Benghazi and then and then mattis is defense secretary comes sitting says don't do it we're not ready we have to at a minimum we have to get all of our consulates and embassies ready in case they're there is a very predictable negative reaction to this right now I know what the right-wingers are we're always right it doesn't matter we could crush them into the ground we could occupy them forever we could spit in their face we could take their capital and if they ever react it's their fault it's their fault and then there's always the back-and-forth who started in this case it is crystal clear who started Donald Trump started it yes so Hamas was not talking about days of Rage even if you want to go to Hamas but allies like Jordan Egypt Turkey now going what are you doing what why did you just do this this makes no sense you've strengthened radicals in all of our countries by doing this you know why first of all religiously of course Jerusalem is very important Trump has never read the Bible never at anything that's he's a buffoon so he doesn't know how important Jerusalem is now I don't give a damn about Jerusalem and the reality of how easy this is to solve and it's only because the right way Israel doesn't want to make a deal yes that's true okay so you give East Jerusalem to the Palestinians and the other side to the Israelis and we're done with it everybody knows that's the answer the UN knows that's the answer the Palestinians know that's the answer most reasonable Israelis know that's answer but Netanyahu's like nope nope nope nope I want all of Jerusalem why because whatever religion BS that he's got the religion BS that the Muslims have and and so why don't we light a match in the middle of the most religious fundamentalist area in the world and see what happens this is what's gonna happen and we know who started it Donald J Trump started it so I want to go to a video from CNN that shows at the time it was a live report and there is a reporter on the scene and just to give you a sense of how much violence broke out as a result of Trump's decision just take a look at this video and how the reporter reacted businesses are closed schools are closed and you're seeing a lot of people go out in the street and voice their anger over here I want to show you this this is kind of what you're seeing the the tires that they're burning and that's what's creating this thick black smoke that you see in the distance here but this is the really the scene this is the reality here in this part of Ramallah where and we're going to move back some more now yeah hey in all right listen get to safety bud we get the sense of what's happening on the ground you let us know if the situation changes with space safe all right we hear them firing they tear gas get out it's coming in get out of it barmy yeah just keep running and don't worry about broadcasting so as we talk about this right now surprisingly and luckily there have been no fatalities as a result of the protests but there have been reports that people were injured one in critical condition those numbers could change at any moment so we're keeping an eye on it but you know when you think about why Trump would make a decision like this consider the fact that even though Tillerson and mattis told him don't do this it's a really bad idea it could lead to further adue destabilization in the Middle East consider the fact that Trump is also surrounded by people who love this and have wanted this including his top donor Sheldon Adelson who would not let the issue go so according to the Washington Post's go-to graphic 24 an important outside voice advising Trump to make the leap was a Dulce n it was a dulce n according to several people familiar with the two men's conversations at a White House dinner earlier this year Adel sin made the issue a main topic one person said in the months that followed Adel sin' periodically asked others close to Trump what was causing the delay and expressed frustration now I'm bringing this up because remember Adel sin is the top donor for Donald Trump and what a Donald Trump say time and time again during his campaign that he can't be bought right he also has Jared Kushner who just recently got caught being one of the heads of an organization that was funding illegal settlements by Israel so he's surrounded by people who have wanted this as well but I think Adel sin is one of the top reasons Jake is shaking his head yeah this is this we don't have a democracy guys this is madness so what the hell's a donor telling the president what to do on important foreign policy and setting the world on fire what this is insanity and throughout the Washington Post article on this they talk about all the donors like without flinching and I'm not blaming to watch the post but like Oh the stoner says this and that doehner says that and then he has to decide between the donors fuck your Secretary of State and your Secretary of Defense is telling you don't do it almost everyone in the room is saying don't do it there you go but wait I gotta call my donors this guy talking about draining the swamp are you kidding me by the way sell the donors were against it so here's a bunch of quotes some outside confidence including billionaire Tom Barak edged trump to hold off so we're having a donor competition oh okay the real cabinet is the goddamn donors so then another one when another donor criticizes how many of the decision trumps seem taken aback okay donor one donor to two or three and don't get into their religious some are Christian summer a Jewish summer whatever else I don't know I don't care that's not the point the point is you're not supposed to be talking to your donors and making decisions based on that okay so then here's one more description from that same Washington Post article the president provided a preview of this week's decision to major donors last weekend at a fundraiser at the Manhattan home a black stone and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman he's unveiling policy not to the public not to you guys not to his voters but to his donors we didn't even know about it the donors already knew so then they have a conversation about it some agree some disagree and then after being showered with praise by billionaire Ronald Lauder for being more pro-israel than past presidents Trump promised that within days he would declare Jerusalem the capital and begin the process of moving to embassy this whole country is bought every almost every politician we have is bought and Donald Trump is the most bought and it look guys it doesn't matter what their policies or anything else is I can see the YouTube comments and the lo some thing that are gonna happen there don't get sidetracked by stupid irrelevant stuff like their religion or their background or their ethnicity or anything like that the problem is the system we allow them to write checks to politicians and hand it to them and then this politicians win based on those checks who the hell do you think they're gonna work for and they just let the world on fire because his donors wanted it I do also want to finish this up by giving you a quote by a senior White House official who spoke to the shetan posts on condition of anonymity this official said that the decision wasn't driven by the peace process the decision was driven by his campaign promise and one of those campaign promises was made specifically to his donors so let's take dash pack.com wolf dash pack.com wolf dash pack.com if you don't get to 28th of memory to get money out of politics look the defense contractors don't want peace in the Middle East so I don't know who in the room was defense contractors or not and I don't know that that was decisive I do know allowing defense contractors and oil companies which both get stand to make billions of dollars for more war in the Middle East allowing them to buy off politicians is insanity and then you got Adelson who wants to kill the unions and new Scotties whatever particular ideology and then you've got Thomas Barak over there you've got this guy over there Ronald water over there what the fuck what the fuck man does this look like the Micra Sea to you wolf dash pack.com if you don't get the money out we're not gonna win you got to go volunteer you got to go bust your ass and whatever state
