this is Greg Greg sits on a bench we sat
on the bench every day for as long as
anyone could remember
Gregg watched as life passed him by
Gregg missed life pants birthdays career
opportunities
VidCon Gregg sat on the bench so long
that people thought he died
Gregg even missed his own funeral and as
Gregg sat alone on the bench a pencil
fell and crushed
Gregg diet and while the story doesn't
have a moral if it did it would be that
in life don't stay stationary or you'll
be killed by station the moral would be
to keep moving forward and to better
yourself but this is just a badly
animated story about a major person so
if you all go back to sitting on our
ventures
