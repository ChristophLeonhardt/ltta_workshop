2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,770
- Hey everyone, it's
me Hallease back with a

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,820
Quick Tech Minute.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,270
So while I've been here in D.C.,

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,660
I've been trying out this Manfrotto,

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,340
it's kinda like a mini tripod.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,980
Like a table tripod for your camera.

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,268
And I've been using it
while here in D.C. to vlog,

9
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,150
and I actually really like it.

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,133
I usually use a Gorilla Pod,
I think that's most people use

11
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,020
but I wanted to give this a try.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,960
Some things to know about
this little guy is that

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,860
it's very compact compared
to the Gorilla Pods,

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,200
and also it's like a mini tripod
so it comes out and extends

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,610
as well so you can make
it different heights.

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,930
The one downfall I will
say of this product though

17
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,120
is that comparatively, with
a Gorilla Pod you can compare

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,130
and make it like,

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,770
as wide or as close together
as you want to create

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,150
different heights for your camera.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,750
Whereas with this one, you
kinda only have two sort of

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,530
preferred heights that
they designed it for.

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,640
I have attempted to use it
at sort of different height

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,470
lengths depending on
what I was trying to do.

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,870
Say if you're trying to
have this on a windowsill to

26
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,890
get a time lapse or something like that.

27
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,790
And you can make it work,
but depending on the weight

28
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,720
of your camera it might be an issue.

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,800
So keep that in mind.

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,250
But overall, even with
those cons, if you will,

31
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,480
I actually really like this.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,930
Because it's a lot
lighter than a Gorilla Pod

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,590
and it actually works
really well for vlogging

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,560
and doing what most of us do,

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,020
which is talking straight to camera.

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,680
So, if you're interested
in purchasing this,

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,400
this isn't sponsored, but
if you're interested in

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,660
purchasing it, I will
link to it down below

39
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,820
in the comments and that's it.

40
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,880
A Quick Tech Minute.

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,030
See you when I see you.
