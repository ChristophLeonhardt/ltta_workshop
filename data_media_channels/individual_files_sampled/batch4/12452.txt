my problem is that there are no cultural conservatives on on TV because they just imagine us as hateful that is the problem we think Fox News says is a lie ignorant backwards lily-white gay hating Obama bashing group no I noticed Roseanne her show where she plays a trump supporter was a smash I mean it was way way beyond expectations Roseanne's characters pro-gay marriage pro-abortion feminist and pro transgenderism and the implication is that she is a good person because of these views the real difference between Trump voters and Hillary voters they're saying our economic in nature not cultural you were a very liberal socially liberal person in general I mean I'm still the same every single comedian is anti Trump and that is the problem it's not one person it's not that there's some people who are on one side and some people on the other is that they all believe the same thing does seem logical that not actively insulting 63 million people is good economic policy I mean there's a lot of stuff a lot of choice on television it's not that you have to you can't actively insult them it's that every show shouldn't actively insult them and some show should agree with them what do we call people that go willy-nilly through life just doing things because it feels good immigrants so how obvious is that as a business model that to me is another point of view that I'm perfectly happy to have on television I'm perfectly happy I have a trump voter who is culturally liberal my problem is that there are no cultural conservatives on on TV because they just imagine us as hateful that is the problem Oh
