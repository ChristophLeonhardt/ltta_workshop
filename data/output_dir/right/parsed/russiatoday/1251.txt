I'm Abbas for another an amber
watching Chris Keller
so I've been saving about three years
now
the dream is finally becoming true I
could have bought a car could have
gotten a lot of different things but I
decided not to because I wanted to go
and watch the World Cup so guys what are
the three things you love most about
Russia
for me it is a proud moment because my
country Pakistan made the Telstar 80
football being used at the World Cup
hopefully I can spread a message of
peace and love from Pakistan to Russia
through football and tell the world that
we are a peaceful nation
you
you
