the Scottish government has just thrown a hundred thousand pounds at asylum seekers in Glasgow who are facing eviction so today I read a story about the Scottish government handing over 100,000 pounds 100k to help asylum seekers who are facing eviction from their homes in Glasgow and they're even saying the Scottish government is saying that they'll provide support until all legal options are exhausted they're desperate to ensure that these people who've come into our country many of whom illegally by the way are allowed to stay on a free ride and have somewhere to live costing them nothing so the BBC's reported on this and they said last week Serco threatened to evict some of the unsuccessful applicants unsuccessful it later announced a temporary reprieve for those at risk the move by the home office contractor was widely criticised by politicians and triggered demonstrations including a hunger strike the plans which would see the locks being changed on doors have been the subject of separate legal actions by shelter Scotland and the Govan Law Centre see what I mean unsuccessful so it's not just refugees asylum seekers its unsuccessful applicants who are just living free of charge and by the way if you don't know what surco is it's a home office contractor that said that they're gonna provide housing or they are providing housing for 330 people at their own expense right now including people who who have no legal right to be in the UK out of their own money their own expense Serco is paying for 330 people to just live just live for free in Glasgow the company said that they're no longer willing to provide that free accommodation to the overstay is fair enough and that they'd be gradually changing the locks to no more than 10 people a week so they've given them notice they're not just booting them out on the street the same listen you guys have got no legal right to be here worth paying for you to be here you've got a certain amount of days otherwise we're going to change your locks it all seems very reasonable to me but the Scottish government and the far off politicians are doing everything they can to ensure that these people get a free ride for even longer so they're just throwing more money at the Scottish refugee G Council towards the tune of a hundred grand and the community secretary for Scotland Eileen Campbell told the BBC while we welcome the pause in the issue of lock change notices this is only at pereira measure and the fact remains that destitution and homelessness are built into the current asylum system placing hundreds of people at risk the plight of the people threatened with eviction demands a resolute and humanitarian approach and we cannot see people turned onto the streets because of the failure of the Home Office's asylum policy it's true we obviously don't want to see people on the streets but these people have no legal right to be here ago they shouldn't be in the country at all they shouldn't not only should they not be living for free on the money of surco in apartments that cost them nothing they shouldn't be living on the streets either they shouldn't be in the bloody country and that's that I heard somebody once called Britain Treasure Island I think it might have been Nigel four-eyes but doesn't that summon up Treasure Island come on over not only you're gonna get a council house even if it turns out that you're not legally able to stay here the government will pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to make sure you're not evicted and then they'll go through all legal options possible to defend you this is insanity this is utter insanity and it makes me wonder why sometimes so many English people including myself a so pro-union if Scotland's this insane then maybe maybe there's an argument to get rid of them although I don't know maybe I still wouldn't go that far yeah I am a union through but you know coming into the UK you get everything for free threatened with eviction the government's gonna pay the money out for you and at the rate of which Scotland's taking in refugees by the way this is just gonna get worse and worse they're gonna have to be throwing more and more money at this because it was only last year in 2017 that Scotland met its target to provide homes for 2,000 Syrian refugees years ahead of schedule years Scotland's first Minister Nicola Sturgeon legs 11 said Scotland is an open and welcoming country in today's celebration welcoming mm Syrian refugee to our country is testament to that and they're so proud of it this is so proud of it the mm mm I can't even pronounce that as a difficult word but the celebrating the fact that 2,000 Syrian refugees have come into the country despite the fact that euro stat the statistical wing of the EU the EU that Nicola Sturgeon loves so much even they admitted that the vast majority of these people aren't even from Syria they're migrants that economic migrants and half of them were coming over well maybe not half but a large number of them are coming over and committing terrible crimes let's say that I think Scotland at this point is hitting peak insanity what more can you say about a country that is welcoming new in people claiming they're refugees knowing full well that they're not and then when these people turn out to be unsuccessful in their application for asylum the government just hands out money to let them stay what is that other than insanity if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our app on the Apple
