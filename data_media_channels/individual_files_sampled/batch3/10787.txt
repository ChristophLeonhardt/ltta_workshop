of cooperation within the international organizations particularly within the UN and its specialized agencies for the fourth and five of April the Russian defence ministry will hold the seventh Moscow conference an international security this is one of the most important political events this is assault after forum which gives an opportunity to discuss pressing issues in security in a professional way the high representatives of many states will attend this event and the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will take part in this conference about the format of his participation will inform you later the first of April the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergei Lavrov will negotiate with the OSCE secretary-general Thomas Graham monger who will visit Moscow to take part in the seventh Moscow conference international security which as I mentioned already is organized by the Russian Defense Ministry they will discuss relevant issues of the Ã¸ystein ways to improve its effectiveness Russia sees I see as a key construction tool of indivisible security community and here Atlantic or the basis of the equitable dialogue and cooperation between over 57% basing States for us the priority task is to defuse tensions and to restore confidence in order to resolve the crimes the crisis of the European security they will exchange views of about the USA's role and contribution to the settlement of conflicts in Donbass Transnistria nagorno-karabakh karabasan Geneva discussions about the stability in Transcaucasia they will also touch upon field activities of the organization in the Balkans in Central Asia and other important subjects of their negotiations will be the functioning of icy Institute's particularly office for democratic institutions and human rights human high commissioner national minorities and representative from the freedom of the media quite often as you know they don't always work in a biased fashion we proceed from the idea that addressing this shortcomings requires the reform of the OSCE which is a key factor in boosting the effectiveness and relevance of the organization the major focus of the reform is the development of the charter of the organization and operating rules of its executive bodies and it's of the utmost priority to preserve the International nature of the organization and the leading role of decision-making bodies and strict compliance with the rule of consensus in the decision-making process there are often mr. graham engulfed and course of negotiations will have a substantive exchange of ideas about the ways to address the imbalance in thematic geographical and staff of their organization they will also discuss the ways to increase the transparency of its program and financial areas well the 6th of April the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will take part in regular meeting of the CIS council of ministers of Foreign Affairs which will take in Minsk the foreign ministers will exchange your views on depressing issues in international and regional agenda and we'll discuss prospects for strengthening multifaceted cooperation within the CIS the meaning will take stock of the implementation of the plan for multi-level ministerial consultations for 2017 and they will approve the similar plan for the year 2018 they will also prove certain documents on law enforcement culture from the Tyrian areas military that will expand ties between CIS states and the areas mentioned above together with the Belarus partners they will submit for the consideration they draft to join statements of ministers of Foreign Affairs of CIS countries on usability of the deletion of principles of non-interference into domestic affairs of other states now let's move to the international agenda I'll talk about the Russian foreign policy and international issues my tradition I'll start with the situation in Syria and development there the counterterrorism operation in East Duty is coming to an end but the but the city of Douma still controlled by fighters but this civilian population was located through organized Unitarian corridors these corridors were established with the help of the Russian soldiers they also hold negotiations to ensure the chance the peaceful transfer of control to the government forces of Syria unfortunately we have to say that these negotiations were interrupted several times by radical fighters who support the continuation of hostilities they explain their position by the fact that reportedly help is on the way these are real consequences of the hysteria around the East guta stirred up by the West we still here empty and made-up accusations against the Syrian government and Prussia about the indiscriminate use of power and massacre of civilians and other lies this lies are allegedly inspired by the care over the destiny of the civilians but in fact these accusations set up obstacles for the achievement of negotiated solutions and the operation to save human lives I'll say to you that 128 thousand people were evacuated from the area in East gouta where counterterrorism operation was held at the same time fighters received an opportunity to move to another territory which is not controlled by government forces in the process of mass exodus according to the union experts know according to you the UN experts international humanitarian law wasn't violated at the same time people receive all the Nestor essentials and food Russian soldiers gave food water bed clothing and they ensured humanitarian access to the afflicted communities as it's mentioned in the UN Security Council resolution 24:01 all this information well they provided by the representatives of the Russian defence ministry which they're doing on a constant basis I need to say that the evacuation of fighters and civilians were organized in a transparent way as we said about this earlier and now we are going to say it once again it was organized in front of everyone because the website the official website of the Russian Defense Ministry shows live broadcast East guta where you can see the movements of fighters to Italy province at the same time live broadcast is organized and the cameras planted Nemo higham Alba Ferdinand urban we hope that human bodies who really urged to help people in East guta when it was controlled by bandits and terrorists will continue to provide humanitarian assistance now enthusiastic way to afflicted communities after this suburb area is liberated every day we receive new facts and evidence for people they who shape a horrifying picture of life in East gouta they talk about bloody conflicts between Baden's and its violence against civilians and all the barbaric things that happening during the distribution of humanitarian assistance as in a Libre in his group our internals where fighters were hiding caches were find out with food and medicine these tunnels I need to say were built by prisoners who supported the Syrian government the current situation in Syria requires coordinated international efforts to maintain international peace security in order to provide humanitarian assistance we call on an international security to help the Syrian population we are still concerned by the messages that the United States and their allies strengthens their illegal military presence on the Syrian territory particularly in the American territory near at turn we see the presence of heavy equipment the road from the mosque to Baghdad is still blocked the Russian side is doing or all their best to urgently achieve political settlements in Syria today on the 29th of March the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is going to match with the UN special envoys mr. de Mistura they will discuss a full range of issues concerning visa stability in Syria particularly the work of the Constitution commits in Geneva in line with the decisions taken on the Syrian National Dialogue Congress on the 30th of January 2018 I'll move to the scruples case the Russian side has repeatedly asked the British authorities to take part in the investigation of the poisoning of Russian citizens particularly watch them to provide us the information about the circumstances surrounding this incident through the Russian embassy we send the notes on the 6th 13th 14th and 22nd of March unfortunately in response to the claims of the Russian Federation the British side remains silent oh I need to say that in a literate way they sent us information they I'm not talking about some mistakes in facts I just do not even say it's things like children of writing that it's difficult even to understand what are they talking about particularly in the letter to them ambassador which should contain the response about the stages of the scruples there is information about the Ambassador himself so it's not just mistakes in facts it's just they are doing it intentionally they want to create a absurd situation or maybe they're totally illiterate at the same time we witness new obstacles created for the Russian representatives who want to help Russian citizens this way openly Russian the British side violates the consulate convention between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom that was signed in 1968 I need to say that the six article contains certain provisions that the consular officer has a right to meet with any citizen of the country that the citizen represents and to provide all the necessary assistance including measures that should be taken in order to provide legal assistance assistance to that person and not in any way the host country cannot impede the activities of the consular office this again I need to say that this document was written in 1968 and I want to remind you that nobody changed that document as you can see that in fact the Great Britain as we assume they're doing it intentionally and they show we go niall ISM and that's not for the first time and we start to think that mystery surrounding the death of Russian citizens are happening on the British territory and the British authorities blame someone else and they actively use propaganda tools and and then they classify the results of the investigation so they show only the results and the conclusions but not the conclusions of the investigation by the conclusions of the political solutions and they don't make public any real evidence they just replace them with the presentation and slides with pictures as your so these pictures were posted by the mass media we see that the Great Britain is involved with serious crimes and why we need to go far just remember the death of scientist Kelly he actually de Velde the lie concerning the weapons of mass destruction quite soon we are going to make public particularly in the British in the Russian embassy to the Great Britain will cost a list of questions that we pose to the British side we addressed this questions through official channels these questions were posed by the Russian ambassador in the Great Britain way often we're being accused of the fact that the Russian Federation does not provide any facts and continues to prove its innocence I need to say that when we found out in the media about this Creepers case about the facts that we cannot say that these affects about the information that was published in the media we immediately tried to contact with the Great Britain the British side on its turn and intentionally refused to contact with the British Embassy in written way or an oral way through telephone conversations these tools these resources there were used by the Russian embassy weren't fruitful weren't successful in order to obtain something at least some data considering the incident even the data the time of the incident the number of people involved the extent of damage and there's medical condition they thinks we have to learn about through the media we still see we continue to witness the performances that were played out by the British politicians in order to fulfill their political means and this political thing that they are doing for the political establishment but you can agree with me how can you obtain any information when he ministers of the British government particularly Prime Minister foreign secretary and defense secretary refused to contact with the Russian representatives they just shout political slogans in the Parliament moving next as you know in the media the media has published the materials that were presented on a closed briefing closed for the Russian represents of a briefing that was organized by the British Embassy I want to highlight that this shows again that the Great Britain intentionally excludes Russia from the list of states who can obtain at least some information the that's briefing that was organized in the British Embassy this briefing excluded the participation of the Russian representatives I need say that this so-called accusations that were voiced in that presentation these are still the same accusations against Russia that are always voiced and don't have any facts from evidence behind them but the most interesting thing that the list of accusations is growing exponentially I want to show you several slides of the 14th of March the propaganda video that was published by the Foreign Office country was accused of eight facts of the so-called Russian state aggression I need to repeat this is a screenshot of the presentation published by the British Foreign Office on the 14th of March there are eight facts on which the Great Britain accuses Russia so the materials that were spread and in the last briefing in Moscow there were twelve facts and I need to say that ten days just passed this seems strange just what can we talk about here we don't even analyze the absurdity of this accusation we are talking about the quality of the information provided it seems like they have new accusations against Russia after their consultations with the older brother actually they change to wordings of their positions they said a gret the Russian aggression against Georgia on the 14th of March Russia was accused by the disrespect for the territorial integrity of Georgia but several days ago this slide show that we are are accused of the invasion of Georgia we're particularly confused by the fact that this increasing list of accusations includes Bundestag hacking in 2015 dear colleagues I need to remind you that we hacked Bundestag once it was in 1945 when we liberated Berlin from the Nazi plague but at that time it was Reichstag as for they mentioned Lisa case and some disinformation campaign launched against Germany we would like to point out that this issue was tackled in a bilateral format between Moscow and Berlin this topic was actively discussed between mr. Lavrov and mr. stern Maher during negotiations they publicly discussed it and officially discussed it and in contrast to the great britain germany conducted real investigation after the information was published i would like to remind those who were in charge of this presentation that official representatives of Russia and Germany made statements about that they made statements after investigation was conducted and after trial was organized and after the person was convicted so why are you doing this information because this is classic hold isn't freely I need to remind you those who forgot about that there was a decision of the German Court they convicted a person who faced with the charges it was true this person committed a crime I would need to say that this investigation was conducted by German law enforcement agencies are you saying that these materials were used as cogent evidence of Russian or russian responsibility for the Solsbury incident this drone pictures that lists Russian since this is a new step in the argumentation I need to see that after your page intention to the publication of this materials the British Foreign Office think just for that after full diplomatic notes being sent no one responded to us we haven't received an information about the medical condition of the Russian citizens we still haven't received any information about them but this behavior is motivated by the fact that they don't see the need to speak with the Russian side but at the same time they thank us in Twitter yes you think us for that ok you're welcome but we will think the British Foreign Office for the recognition of the fact that these materials you handed out to the British Embassy for the ambassadors accredited in Moscow I I had doubt that he would do that but actually you recognized this is the evidence that you have the evidence that mr. Huntsman was talking about I have certain doubts that you've made it consciously maybe you thanked us for that and record and maybe you admitted that you did it by mistake but you did it this will remain forever in your history there is new video now that the whole world has seen your so-called proof through the propaganda machine and through the unnamed sources through the experts through the fake accounts in social media spreading information claiming that supposedly the main accusations were given by the British ambassador in Russia during his briefing I can't even suppose what was this undoubtable proof of Russia's guilt if our British colleagues were too scared to give them out with the presence of the Russian Foreign Ministry representatives they were not allowed in they were not invited to that close Britain this means this is an absolute total global fake I would like to say that this is the propaganda machine at work and yesterday the radio station which is sponsored with the American taxpayers money brought together experts also work for analytical centres sponsored by the US taxpayers they all began trying to prove and say that they should not directly and seriously consider these proof because everything is clear as it is and one of those experts I say once again this wasn't on air of the Russian media it was in the US media the media which are sponsored by the American ammonia so they asked a question why do we need that improve ready see that so many countries have supported Britain and then I quote you really think their world is idiots and only Russia's smart and intelligent it's not in ministry who said that it was said by an American expert who works in American nickel Center no yes it happens it happens with Iraq it happened when our Western partners Washington and London showed the whole world his so-called samples and the whole world believed them because they were showing that in the Security Council of the United Nations 10 years have passed and everyone realized I'm sorry but I encode the expert from Comedy Central I realized they were idiots and they were apologizing for that for a long time but human lives can be returned due to the statements by mr. Johnson who compared the roll-top that will take place in Russia so if you compared it with the 1936 Olympics in the Third Reich they promised a surprise for Boris Johnson he might not that we always keep our promises on the 14th of March the Prime Minister of Britain Teresa may declare that the football World Cup in 2018 in Russia will not be attended by the officials and members of the royal family of the United Kingdom this is important in the context of what we are about to talk about once again she said that officials and members of the royal panel would not come on the 21st of March the British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson answering the questions of the members of parliament through International Affairs Committee agreed that the upcoming for the World Cup in Russia could be compared with the 1936 Olympics and the Third Reich quote afraid this absolutely true Johnson yes your description of the events in Moscow in the world capital stadiums yes I think comparison with 1936 is absolutely justified end quote mr. Johnson what are you talking about let's get this clear first point are you talking about sports you're talking about sports you're talking about organizing the international events themselves in the area of sports and if you were talking about the level of organization of the Olympics just admit that back then the International Olympic Committee officially noticed a high level of organizing those games we went to the archives we read the telegrams and wires by the Soviet ambassador so the Soviet ambassador Yakov Surratt's and his message to Moscow his encrypted report agreed with the evaluations of the International Olympic Committee on the high order and level of organization of the Olympics second point perhaps Boris Johnson did not mean sports and the organization of the sports events what did he mean that perhaps he was talking about the political situation in Germany back then and perhaps he was talking about the attitude to these events from the British establishment in this case we would like to remind for his Johnson and all the British people of the level of official representation of Britain and dimensioned Olympics of 1936 what people were representing Britain in Berlin in 1936 the 1936 published official brochure published in Germany called the Honorable guests of the 11th Olympic Games I have it here and speaking frankly everything connected to that Iraq those events and the political situation I'm saying this frankly and sincerely I find it unpleasant even to hold it is blast from the past but I still had to read all of it and for your convenience we will show you the slides they will also be available today at our information resources so who was representing Britain at the Olympic Games of 1936 let's start number one for two lovers tattoo captain even hotter they were the representatives and the presence of the National Olympic Committee of Britain Secretary General of the National Impa Committee of the country now let's move on to the British representatives in the International Olympic Committee they are Lord a bird our Lord never George Berkeley Marquis Dexter no I will Curtis Bennett now moving on to the British representation in international sports federations they were also present in Berlin William Jones the secretary-general of the International Basketball Federation Sir William Burton presence of the world's hailing Federation major hassles me the sector of the International sailing Federation this only means one thing these people took part in the official events connected with the Olympic Games they were at the stadiums they were at the opening ceremony they actively communicated with with others in 1936 in Berlin talked with the local authorities and unlike the diplomatic corps representatives accredited back then in Germany who were present had the events due to their functional responsibilities the aforementioned members of the British establishment arrived in Germany voluntarily once again they came to Berlin Hitler in 1936 as representatives of the British establishment members of the House of Lords there is Tokra see let me remind you that by 1936 Germany was already poisoned with the ideology I won't even mention the political atmosphere of those times I will just remind you that at that point they had a system of concentration camps for the enemies of the Nazi regime for their social elements for the accused and other categories of citizens the Nuremberg racial laws were in fact up to 1952 Summer Olympics in Finland the Soviet Union did not take part in the Olympic Games the USSR ignored the games in Berlin - and the non participation of the Soviet teams in the Olympics of that time war connected with a number of ideological and political reasons and much has been written about that it's also explained by the fact that in the International Olympic Committee refused any direct contacts highly evaluated the organisation of the Olympics in Berlin the National Olympic Committee of the Soviet Union was established on the 23rd of April 1951 I won't go be deep into history can do it yourself so mr. Boris Johnson don't you find it shameful and as you like to say notice that the participation such a large number of British functionaries all seen in 1936 Berlin what war all those distinguished British people doing as Hitler's guests tell that to your country but this is not all for Britain since Boris Johnson made a number of other statements beside the Third Reich you also remember Dostoevsky so the Foreign Minister of Britain the same Boris Johnson during his speech on the 28th of March compared the so-called scribbles case with the actions described in the children dostoevsky's novels crime and punishment quote this whole case resembles the beginning of crime and punishment meaning that we all are sure the criminal is the question is whether they will admit that or they will be caught Boris Johnson the full speech is published on the British Ministry website Boris Johnson did you read crime and punishment up to the end or did you and it in the very beginning since you decided to remember the words of children is key let us use the image and the thoughts of one of the characters of the investigator for fear of the trovich who was rather meticulous in his investigation of the murder you know unlike you we have read the stay yes key like his works and we know them so let me quote children yes realize that it might be shocking for you about hold on out of a hundred hairs you cannot make a horse out of a hundred suspicions you cannot make proof as one British proverb this is only common sense what about the passion try to deal with it that's why the investigator is a pair first of all especially for Boris Johnson from the slave ski from 100 rabbits we cannot make a horse read Dostoyevsky that's useful for you know as you say a clue let's say it is a clue a clue is a double-edged sword and I'm an investigator so I am a weak man I admit it investigation should be mathematically clear I would like to find such a clue as clear as two and two is four countable proof this is also Dostoyevsky also by porfiry petrovitch the investigator let me remind you that Brittain neglects all rules of international law and declared that Russia took part in the poisoning of Cripple without any investigation or clues and so on and London still has not provided any proof they did not even give any exact picture of the events of that day if you have any other information please share it there were numerous accusations towards Russia of poisoning its own citizens using the military-grade chemicals a massive political and media campaign was unleashed let me see once again Russia has nothing to do with this incident Russia has nothing and no official information from London if we continued parallels with literature the role of Rodion Raskolnikov from crime and punishment would be suitable for the former British Minister Tony Blair he decided to start the aggression against Iraq in 2004 under the pretext of the weapons destruction in this country while everyone knew that they did not have any WMDs everyone knew that and then he asked for forgiveness and he admitted he definitely admitted it now can you remind you of the words of Tony Blair I'm fully responsible for any mistakes and I express my deepest regrets due to the victims of the operation in Iraq and I support our armed forces mr. Johnson will you find the strength admit your guilt since you do not have any proof of the Russians role in the poisoning that took place on British soil now the topic which is more or less linked with the problem we've taken note a large number of materials from the Czech media and a large number of materials in our media they were mentioning matter of the diplomats expulsion and they were trying to analyze the statements by the foreign ministry saying that states which were developing chemical which are called knowledge shock in the West include the Czech Republic and they made numerous insinuations and official statements and so on and due to this high interest for this global topic of three poles in this aspect in particular let me remind you once again that the note explaining the real situation was published on the ministry website on the 21st of March it's that explanations are required as to why Russia was accused on this criminal case while the development of the so-called knowledge shock was led by Britain the US Sweden and Czech Republic the results of these countries in the creation of new poisons of this type are reflected in more than 200 open sources of NATO countries this is our official position and they began drawing conclusions of accusations there were no accusations there were only facts they began asking questions including questions through many mass media and social media they asked what are these open sources what exactly are you talking about let's see what we're talking about it is no secret it is no revelation this is absolutely basic information for those who are aware of the history for example the Warsaw Pact for a long time the Czech Republic back down Czechoslovakia highly developed chemical industry this scientific potential was in high demand back then in those times when Czechoslovakia was a member of the Warsaw Pact within this structure within the organisation of the Warsaw Pact Prague was especially responsible for chemical protection within the eastern bloc all mass media show that these materials are available there are articles on the topic saying that after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact the Czech scientific potential was in high demand by its new Western partners and in the end we can say figuratively inherited by NATO they check home a chemical Defense Department's had several special assignments in the Middle East a Czech military visited Iraq and they worked on the consequences of the use of weapons of mass destruction in Kuwait this is open information the publish means of the media on the activity of scientific centers in the Czech Republic carrying out programs on whoa great chemical weapons allow us to make a conclusion that the neural gases have an important role in this work they are classified in the West as nabhi chakra once again this information is available online it works were led by the toxicology department of the Faculty of military medical and sensory disciplines of the Czech Defense Ministry instead of weapons of mass destruction protections and the section of weapons of mass destruction protection of the military Research Institute and the Czech Republic the 31st regimental radiation chemical and biological protection of the Armed Forces of Czech Republic cooperates with them closely its tasks include providing information on the use of chemical weapons obtained during this day of the Czech military in the middle issue I repeat these are the materials that are available freely online in particular and if you have an official reaction to these facts you can ask Czech side so once again from the media important projects on chemical weapons are carried out by that department and its employees have unique scientific equipment and their own research and developments meant for studying the consequences of the use of neuro political gases and their laboratories include high-tech equipment studying the effects on organic tissue and a neural system after the toxic effects of chemical weapons and poisons another area of research of the Czech scientists is the development of antidotes this is the work that we all now know as well as the so called linking substances and other substances for the hues as antidotes in human tissues the research is conducted by the Czech Republic in close cooperation with a NATO profile structures and all the information this research is available online and in the last years the Czech scientists have received grants of the Scientific Committee of NATO for three times the Czech scientific centers have been noted by the American military specialists and it is also worth noting that a NATO Center for the protection from weapons of mass destruction is active in the Czech Republic in the town of wish Cove in South Moravia it is the main research structure of the Alliance in this area the center was opened on the 22nd of November 2007 on the basis of the Czech Institute of the protection from weapons of mass destruction of the University of the minstrel defence the so-called core of the center from the very beginning of its activities according to the media you can check that more than 60 specialists from eight countries of course of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization these countries include representatives of Great Britain and Germany as well as other countries they all are NATO members and this year the center will also include military specialists from Canada who already carry out a number of joint projects it remains unclear whether this Center is accountable to the Czech Republic in regards to their own developments and in the context of materials available to it including the possible unaccounted chemical weapons doesn't that speak to a certain particular thing when now they are talking about solidarity so this is what it is based on from the 23rd of March the Czech Medical Journal and we like to read such additions we quoting other sources publish the material on toxic all in Europe nerve agents that are classified in Western countries as knowledge shock according to these data in the article there are about 100 structural variants of these substance it is obvious that the information that the Czech commencer possess and about information about the production of these substances testifies to the general availability of this information and crosses out the information presented in the pictures that you've seen today that show the exclusive rights of Russia in the production of massage substances the same day in Lida banovina another media outlet quoting the scientists it was assumed that the research check centers could develop military-grade chemicals like now a joke but at the same time the sole summation of the be a reservation that these were meant to defend effectively from such chemicals could they have other girls other than defense so break is not accused of anything accusations are announced by us unlike our British colleagues it is not propaganda it is not fake news these are Czech magazines and newspapers that started their work long ago and in the media space there is lots of there are lots of materials proving great level of chemical developments in the Czech Republic and we should take it into account let's move to other topics seeing the materials and the statements new statements about Nikolas and stuff and we were puzzled by them and we speak about them as new speculations in the Western media and they are about the death in Washington of on the 5th of November 2015 of our former Russian minister Michael Essien so they also found Russian trail in this case it would maybe would not good now that would not admit it but all these statements are based on the British a truth-teller Christabel steals announcement who compiled the famous dog fear against Donald Trump the skills of British special services in organising this vacation such provocations are well known and there is a TV series like Austin Powers on this topic so to do something undone shift away on others is a signature style these British special services and according to the investigation conducted in the United States the death of Lessing was an accident and these materials are restricted years and we cannot disclose them and if there are new data then the Russians say sides should be notified in the first place because it is about the Russian citizen but we at this point of time we didn't receive any information moving to other topics on the situation on the Korean Korean Peninsula I would like to say that we are constantly working to reinforce the positive trends in the Korean Peninsula and around it and we are working on organizing a number of meetings with the representatives who will come to Moscow in the future and we will provide additional information upon approval we will also like to comment the sign by Poland of the contract on the shipment of American anti-missile system Patriot and we are very anxious about the militarization of this state and another approve of that was these contract and also scaling up its expenditures on a defense and of reforming of the system of military management and increases the number of its army and it's trying to escalate these presence on the Polish territory and we use such steps as an element for disabilities in the political situation in Europe and also as a threat to the national security of the Russian Federation but we would like to say that Russian defence resources are enough to ensure the intactness of our borders and our territory on the 28th of March in Belgrade there was an Remembrance Day of the election of the NATO aggression in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia it was a federal violation of international law and all rooms of morality because during 78 days the North Atlantic Alliance are conducted very prominent of the Serbian cities and as a result about 2,000 civilians were killed including 400 children including even more so these victims are called collateral damage and above in the West and the pretext for such tragic events was an accident in erotica where Serbs allegedly killed severely civilan Albanians and the French experts forensics experts the this information and fake news was used for justifying declaration of a NATO and nobody even apologized for this accident so the apologies are not a quality of the NATO it seems and about 20 years passed and nothing has changed and if we reiterate on iterate of the statement on whether all people are idiots that I mentioned this Carnegie centers statement so that at that time the world to play this bloody game because Lisa was a propaganda manipulation conducted by the United States and by its allies but we see such conduct in nowadays this situation makes us think about how think that happened in Salisbury in the adult days can a so-called chemical attack about the pictures that were made up somewhere and we'd like to speak about the detention of the Ukrainian fishery fishing vessel node and Russian fishing ship Nord was a detained on the 28th of March by Ukrainian border board guards this is another provocation by the Iranian authorities and the Ukrainian border guards were acting acting to the Somalian pirates the crew of this ship was fishing in this year of a self in a strict compliance with the current official regulations and we view it as an action to take revenge on the Crimean a population for their conscious choice in order to reunite with Russia that was made in 2014 and another topic related to Ukraine we learnt about the intention of Ukraine to toughen of the migration rules told it's a foreigners and in particular for Russian citizens and this is a requirement for online at notification beforehand and we view it as artificial barriers created by Ukraine between our nation's and the authorities do not know what to undertake what to do next and they wanted to prevent our citizens from maintaining a Familia and other ties and contacts we hope that these attempts not to allow normal communication between our nation's because they would not succeed on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the rebellion of the sabor prisoner prisoner camp and this event was commemorated on the 22nd of March in Vienna and the organizers was the Petrovsky Foundation and the Institute of Education of the Austrian body of Liberty of freedom we think that such events are a great message and help us to conserve for the memory of the past and to conserve the memory of the Jewish people tragedy and make us remember the concentration camps and it is very important to utilize this memory at the time when there are times taken to rewrite the history and when the monuments are destroyed in honor of those who have fallen for the victory organizes is I'm ready to answer your question a lot so far the reality a news portal maria vladimirovna although Turkey is a NATO member Turkey has read used refused to take measures against Roger Russia on the scruples case we believe and we understand the pressure exerted by London and Washington and we have no doubts that these are synchronized actions taking with regard to the importance in the European Union and NATO we understand the pressure that it's a great pressure exerted by them with the use of the principle of solidarity and the principle of the unique political course as for the provocation of expanding the diplomats the initiators of Washington and London and do you see the number of diplomats expelled and Russian consulate is closed on the charter of the united states that a spontaneous solidarity action of course not so we believe that the countries that made that made this mistake they are under pressure and we have examples when countries were submitted to such kind of fresh a political ideological one and after the words they always regretted that you can see such examples in the corresponding documents and many countries regret the things happened to happened in Iraq in Serbia and they think that their participation in those campaigns was shameful we believe that the countries that didn't show solidarity sure responsible approach not only to the ties with the Russian Federation but also to the international law tomorrow after tomorrow the target of such provocation could be an estate run without our trials without any decision an accusation can be made and the charges can be brought without any hearing so this is a matter of responsible behavior of a particular state Canada Canada Canada Radio you have somehow answered my question but I'd like to ask once again how do you consider the statement of the Minister of Canada she said that scruple is not only a false case this is a pattern of racial behavior which is unacceptable like in Crimea in Ukraine etc this question was asked to all the ambassador's ambassadors asked what the decision with the motives and reasons was work for these decision and it's surprising that there is a notional for solidarity in the European Union and nature and recently you we witness summit they devoted a great deal of attention to scrip hours case and even didn't mention a sovereign card but now less they could not formulate what was the reason to expel Russian diplomats first they explained that it was solidarity when they were asked whether it is an accusation they could not provide any reasonable response they said that it was just likely some Contras did that others said that they could not command the situation on the question whether they had any claims regarding other persons that were being expelled they had different positions not only within the lock the Alliance they differed even in the departments that we talked with so at first they said that it was an act of solidarity and then in the TV sessions they talked about the spy network so what you are talking really about is it about the spy network is it's about solidarity or maybe it doesn't matter you can choose some pictures and then quickly say that somehow we will do that so let's talk about why is this all knitted so Russian untie Russian campaign and rhetoric and we have many times mentioned that but it has to do with entry it refers to Syria about a month or two ago the main topic discussed in the media was the situation in eastern Ghouta and you were telling that there is a humanitarian catastrophe in this region but now we see that there is no catastrophe that it is going to leave a fade of a lappa that it's returning to normal life the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has installed the online cameras and it is impossible to anyone and cannot say that the children and civilians are killed so about several months ago all the media we're trying to tell these fairy tale about Eastern Goethe and how can we you distract the attention from Syria to some other topic there is a comic serious Yes Prime Minister 87 years as 87 year and there were many serious serious filmed the question was posed how to do to distract it what to do to distract the attention from some problem and they said that in that case they had to expel Russian diplomats and then to make him some legend that maybe some assistant of the ambassador was the KGB agent and back then and then everybody would understand that is threat to the national security this is classical thing that is applied in this case during several years the main topic and the red line in all the negotiations in all the meetings of the international community on Syria was chemical chemical topic chemical weapons topic and they destroyed with the help of you with the resting countries this is was an unbearable well unparalleled operation initiated by Russia and conducted by the Western countries no they say that Damascus applies such uses such weapons how could things great at Russia another's issues in that they can say that the Russia just uses these weapons in Great Britain this is a classical patterns nobody wants to see what is happening in eastern Goethe everybody say that Russia is using such chemicals here CBS Bob Ross CBS we're going to answer all your questions Grigory fungal Bulgarian national radio marry Sahara was the reaction to the decision of Bulgaria to summon their ambassador so what's the Russian response to then let's not to ask questions about each country please I just wanted to say to you that I said about the attitude of the countries each country that by should understand that by taking any decision but motivated by boycott and demonstration of their position they all these decisions should be taken in the basis of all the materials and information that they have I think that this question should be posed to officials why are they summoning them bass the Ambassador what is he going to do there I don't think that the question that's what we should discuss today why are they taking this decision maybe they have some information that without any trial without any international examination international investigation that shows something if they have it maybe they should share it with everyone well I believe in Bulgarian mass media maybe you will be able to find something yes please so let's not ask about each country but since the Russian diplomats were expels but if Russia's going to take her teletran measures let's not focus on that materials about the retaliatory measure so this will be adequate and appropriate measures we are working on them we will tell you about them later when we will work out them properly yes please please understand that we cannot show all the surprises Commerce and the Ministry has expressed several more warnings to Russian citizens about the fact that they can be arrested under the request of the United States bearing you know bearing in mind that relations between Russia in the United States and other countries are a bit strained my question is if this warnings are still relevant and if is it possible that there will be more arrests I think that in this case I need to say that that's warning that we issued and this morning remains relevant media outfit test the ambassador of Poland to the Soviet Union said that many Soviet monuments are not aesthetically beautiful so what's your reaction to this statement you know we're going to go far with this statement we can say that certain people are not beautiful so why why do they leave so this is a dangerous logic that can lead to such consequences wouldn't Iraq that monuments and we didn't make them beautiful we didn't announce any competitions to build the most beautiful most aesthetic monuments you know for me it's a mystery this statements are not a mystery but its mystery for me how this monuments were established at that time Europe was destroyed Europe was for Europe was called and Europe was hungry so we established all the necessary infrastructure objects for Europe because the end of the Second World War the Great Patriotic War it wasn't the end we perfectly remember how much time we needed to eradicate all the Nazi soldiers and we had to do that for years so imagine that situation Europe in ruins people for many years couldn't leave their lives when they were a lot of damage to people injured people people who require some assistance food medicine at least something at least some hope for life but despite all that they were enough resources and enough will and enough force to establish those monuments because these were the people who together with you together with those people combated against nazi soldiers that's why those monuments were set up you know from it's quite shameful to talk about it it's shameful for me in 2018 to hear that people who respect international humanitarian law human rights who express sympathy who talk about the division of responsibilities it's shameful that they talk about monuments in such manner yes please CBS I will interpret I will interpret the question of they correspondent Charles the Doggett I perfectly understand that you cannot voice they confer measures taken by the Russian Federation but what message what idea would like Russia to voice you know this is a provocation is this as was a provocation because if you ask me to tell it about you in several words I wouldn't think that our format will allow us to do that at least in several words I think that the expert from the Koenig essentia said everything already I don't think that I will be better than the expert because that's what the expert said he asked this question why do I need to make up something else who will be next do you know the question that is often posed to me by journalists and people who I know and I don't know people that I meet they ask the question where our world is going and I don't know what to say but that's a part of my job to say them you know this question could be used as part of a question posed by the expert from the Carnegie center this question could be posed to other countries do you understand how our relations will develop do you understand that where are all it concerns one this you found that ill-founded accusations when you don't have any evidence when he accused someone without any evidence it's a crime just read your national legislation is a crime yes please Sputnik good afternoon I have two questions from all over the year our journalists don't receive press cards and accreditations to the events held by the Foreign Ministry of France and la Perlas they don't come to briefings like this one at the same time the journal ISA blamed for bias to coverage of the political situation in France so how many of journalists of French media accredited in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the second question concerns of heavier and its citizens as for Sputnik we are doing our best to we have repeatedly said it to Paris we also explained the situation to the embassy we addressed the relevant letters we expressed our concerns to the OSCE oisi representative from the freedom of the media we only heard one phrase from the French representative which says that the decision let's use proper words this is a clear discrimination when the person is denied access to such official service when all the criteria are met we were said that this is a decision taken unilaterally by the French president we haven't received any more response this is a response that we received in many levels but this response is connected with the personal attitude we haven't received any clear explanation we were just said that this is a decision taken by the host of the Elysee Palace the French president they didn't mention the violation of some norms or misbehavior I just can say you that this is a decision taken by the French president as for your second question could you remind it please of the mic what of the mic frankly speaking we don't have any information about the provision of the citizenship to residents of aphasia but all information is can be found in the agreement between a page in Russia signed 2014 on the 4th of November right now we're working out collateral agreement on that matter do you have any more questions yes please John sparks from Sky News in relation to the scruple of poisoning we have a situation where we have a large group of countries who simply don't believe Russia's denials a large group of countries who do not believe the alternative explanations that have been put forward by officials in Russia do you accept does this ministry accept that Russia has a serious credibility problem we've yeah we pretty much you know you need just to understand are we playing cards oh we are making serious things are the interpreting because we need to understand are we playing poker here or we're talking about international relations at the moment because this is the common responsibility to respect the international law this is a real international game but within the rules of the UN Charter whether it's the use of power and influence because that's the west over many years over dozens of years said that force cannot be used you cannot use political influence ideological pressure that's happened after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and we learned that rule we started to develop our relations with our partners on an equal basis we started to use such terms as economic and financial competition like competition in many areas area as proposals for more beneficial projects we started our partnership on more democratic norms I think no one believed that we will succeed we were taught to do all that we started to play this game and we were successful in it we were successful in the development of integration in that aggression unions were said that the world is not unipolar anymore we started talking about the fact that we're reliable energetic partner even though the structure insists and political systems are changing that there are certain transformations economic and political transformations going on in our country but these transformations will never question the supply of gas to Europe we think we are facing with the same difficulty that we can ask for help that countries can ask us for our help that we're ready to share with intelligence information we can be reliable partner in counterterrorism cooperation despite a fact that we have different visions about the settlement in Afghanistan we are ready to provide assistance to the United States on this track we were the first to do that we became open transparent and real actors in international relations when we became successful as other states became successful in various regions of the world or the world we started to feel that some countries are dissatisfied certain dissatisfied some energetic project that we proposed to Europe make the United States uncomfortable and they are doing all their best to derail this project well let's talk and the United States and Europe dislike mixing apple and oranges but at the same time we started noting that we have historic ties with these states now families will still have four people who live on the territories of former Soviet republics and we see that in the former Soviet republics where their family members so leave these people faced with anti Russian policy and instead of saying that we're not going to play like this anymore since they don't want to develop relations with us on an equal basis we started to ask questions we started to say that it's inappropriate to do like that with regard to Russia we started to say that this will result into the international severe crisis you're talking about credibility but if you're going to act like the United States the Great Britain to undermine this credibility then we're talking about the crisis of credibility you see this is not solidarity this is not support the most fantastic thing is that the word solidarity has another meaning then the meaning that they trying to use today to impose today solidarity is not when you are made to support so there she is not one of your face west pressure solidarity is when despite all the difficulties despite all the circumstances you support you provide your support what solidary tell we're talking about what are you talking about we're talking about direct pressure threats just look at the beginning the EU summit was organized it seems like the the first retaliatory measures could be developed Universal which Ã©litaire measures and the course of action could be developed for example in one day they will take one action but look all the EU Member States I cannot even say if the Great Britain is a member state of the European Union but those countries that remained in the EU they took decisions to expel Russian diplomats so it's not like they expelled some of them unlike the United States who expelled like 60 of them but I need to say that they made this decision in different days someone found us and voiced one number and then we received a list with another numbers once we received one reasons for their expulsion and now we're receiving other reasons for the expulsion and representatives of the diplomatic corps told us about this you know that I know I'm sure that you're aware of that if you don't know about that that's quite shameful that it means that you are not interested in that what solidarity are you talking about what credibility are you're talking about it's not like the DeMars novels when they were talking about solidarity and credibility this categories are not used are not based on behavior morals of the Security Security Service officers and I have a question one more question what do you think after the Iraq campaign West Western countries in those countries who were in the coalition do they deserve for credibility do you have forces to answer that question of the mic I'm really asking you that question because I don't see you quite often here we have as you can see interactive dialogue here yeah it needs a Nashville pros but I already answered your question and I have a question for you do you have forces within yourself to answer us if those countries who started campaign against Iraq do they deserve this credibility was naked yell of tongue store you know the thing is that I asked you a question not as to the representatives of the Great Britain but this government provides you support I asked you I pose you a question as a journalist I'm not asking you an official answer I'm just asking you as a journalist as a person could you please find forces within yourself to answer my question or not the precision is do you have any more questions yes please according to international law the US authorities have the right to expel difference from the UN and what is the future of the organization and if so what is it and it's been mentioned that the anglo-saxons have a bit a limited world view and there's certain information that 160 countries did not join their actions we feel it we see it from ordinary citizens from international structures really feel any solidarity or support from them so as for the first question the United States of America do not have the right to unilaterally expel diplomats working in the United Nations that's what the relevant procedures are for the United States has the responsibility as a host country of the United Nations the relevant procedures are stated and say how the activities of certain diplomats can be terminated we are trying to understand in what way the United States is implementing such decisions it is our understanding that these procedures were not employed our mission at the UN is working on this matter as for your second question I have talked about it in great detail today the only addition I have is that I cannot say that we feel the support or the lack of support I think it would be right to say that we can feel colossal confusion both from the officials of different countries and from the public and from the journalists to they all are trying to understand what is going on and mainly they can't understand what this may lead to this is the confusion the understanding that the world is trying to tip its balance it's very dangerous this is the feeling I get from my talks this is the feelings I get from talking with the ambassadors the feeling the ambassadors get from talking with the people in their countries this is the parent they do not understand what is going on they do not understand the real situation they do not know the facts as for the people who receive numerous letters from the public from the civil society from Russia from abroad they all show a feeling that the world is in the state of turbulence who is responsible for that what is going on why is that so so many lessons have been given from such situations they began with prompt actions then they resulted in consequences that cannot be repaired can only classify London's actions as provocative global international provocation sorry Boris not now I'm not ready yet Boris is very nice first of all accept my condolences as a mother for what has happened recently in Kemerovo I think that you take this very closely to your heart now recently I asked you the question how dangerous this situation was you said that was no letter there was no scale to evaluate that today you quoted the situation in Iraq the war we gave examples of provocative actions from the past and who stood behind those actions when we talk about trust we should face the facts number of pictures that was shown in the embassy and spread by Britain in particular stated that Russia had previously committed similar acts against the Russian citizens on British territory none of the cases on the Russian citizens who died who were killed or something happened to that all of them were very mysterious nothing came to a conclusion in order for the public to understand the essence of the case purple each name is the Berezovsky mr. Litvinenko a number of other mysterious death cases remain absolutely classified so we cannot say that the situation is similar that Russia is acting recipe it's impossible because we do not understand what happened previously in those cases at the same time we have open cases which have the solid proof of manipulation of the public view when we're talking about Iraq when we were talking about others I think we can also mention the situation in Libya when they proclaimed one goal and now we see that the whole situation resulted in the collapse of the country and the tragedy of a whole Libyan people and mainly it unravels all of the factors with the money with the involvement of European politicians this situation is atrocious the way it goes on now and you as representatives of the European media know better than me how it turns now how the situation goes on so the responsibility and the irresponsible and provocative actions of London of Great Britain of the United States there are numerous examples of that what are we comparing this to so Iraq was mentioned as one of the most vivid examples of how we were lied to they could not like to ask the Russian Federation they could not deceive Germany they did not manage to deceive France unfortunately they managed to deceive Italy how sorry and by the way remember how they got in the coalition I'm telling this to Sky News representatives take a look at the similarity of the methods that were used when they were building the coalition on Iraq and now the supposed solidarity the methods are the same for example what is the point of sending ten people from a European country to the anti-drug coalition they make no contribution neither military nor political nor financial and no morale five or ten people would make no contribution to this campaign so why were they doing that in order to show how the West massively supports the cause as a single front how the countries manifest solidarity this is not solidarity forgetting solidarity has a different meaning they were simply building a coalition to go to Iraq to destroy the parent who the tyrants who were threatening the world with weapons of mass destruction the same traces here the same patterns this kale in the story are different but once again they're building a political front because for the lack of proof can be given they can show a list of countries for supporting them why do we need a list of countries we know how this list was made and you know that you should know that they were threatening some of them asking some of them of giving promises some of them are stood on their own that they would better support Britain and sign the paper so that's the only reason why I gave the example of Iraq and I of course thank you for showing your condolences on the occasion of the tragedy in camera four we have received words of support from the whole world words from ordinary citizens coming to our embassies they were laying flowers and lighting candles leaving notes and two plush toys and writing on blogs they were journalists and of course they were officials from other countries expressed our understanding of how they could express condolences on one day and a decisive time talk about the unfriendly stats towards Russia and doing it in the same paper the same document as the number of countries did but once again we are grateful to all of those who express their support for Russia for Russian citizens and of course the people who live in camera of who lost friends and family in this atrocious tragedy thank you yes learn it learn is free this boutique agency if I may the Polish matter a bit of espionage today and we'll be talking about the spies in Poland on the very day when the Polish foreign ministry declared the expulsion of four Russian diplomats was announced that the Polish intelligence agencies had detained a Russian spy it was a Polish citizen working in the energy ministry of Poland and supposedly he was working for the Ministry of Energy and transferring certain information to Russian special services on the construction of the gas pipe in all three North stream too which is strange because it's built in Russia so the most interesting point is the polish media including the abortion newspaper they all are saying that the arrested spy was actively commenting on one internet forum and even created his own forum on Facebook and was conducting active discussions on the internet on Facebook on the energy policy of Poland was he a Polish citizen yes he is a Polish citizen working in the Polish Ministry of Energy could you comment on this story of ridiculous espionage no no I do not have any comments to make on this point I am not aware of this situation I can only get back to you later yes please still coming back to this crippled case what do you think about the precedent which has been created in the international law the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats I've talked about it on numerous occasions this is not a matter of the expulsion president unfortunately expulsion of diplomats is a part of routine diplomatic work generally this happens in secret without making the situation public the so called exchange situation sometimes when the countries want to show the drama of the moment they are doing it publicly openly even though they have preliminary agreements on these actions in this case this was a demonstration a demonstration of support once again very dangerous underlying basis the actions and steps taken by the European Union are used by London which is leaving the European Union as proof of the guilt of the Russian Federation no one minds the country's speaking out and expressing their views on the matter they can do it any way they want in such an extravagant matter manner this is not the issue here Ishi is that these shows of solidarity were only necessary as the only argument which could be used for the international community the show once again let's remember what the Carnegie expert said how can so many people be mistaken how can so many states be mistaken they are trying to substitute the legal basis of the story this is a precedent here not the expulsion the so-called solidarity is being used as proof it has nothing to do with what happened in Salisbury and the countries well you are journalists you can ask your government your officials ask them for the materials what are they waiting for it's been almost a month what are they waiting for what's going on with the materials what should happen all these materials to be given two months later why not now these questions remain and answered we will publish the number of the questions today the embassy in London will do it any more questions thank you ABC News before the recent events with the expulsion of the plans there was a phone call between the US president and Russian president in which they mentioned the necessity of holding a summit and further in contacts due to the recent events does that mean that all contacts will be cut and summit will be delayed frozen I cannot comment on anything related to the summit whether it began or not this is a matter for the administration of to the Office of the President as for the contacts the State Department as you know they have declared a nomination for a new secretary of state since Tillerson has left his post and now he will be replaced by mr. Pompeo but there was no appointment yet so we can't talk close to the contacts through the foreign ministry since the new head of the State Department has not yet began his work we are in contact with the US Embassy we regularly exchange the lists in this case they give us their lists we give them we give them ours this is contact - yes please support the agency we have a technical question the Western countries reacting to this cripple incident are expelling an unprecedented number of pro Russian diplomats 140 people what will become with them I would like to tell you we have already mentioned our evaluation of the situation as for the future destiny I can say that all the employees of Russian foreign mission whose work was terminated by the host states in accordance with the Russian laws of course they all will get their appointments and all the Russian diplomats coming back to Russia will continue their careers their professional knowledge and experience are in very high demand take second questions at this point yes please Armenia Public Television away from the Russian responses and other issues what are the possible solutions for the situation we are talking about this constantly what is the absurdity of the situation unfortunately correct me if I'm wrong at least we have an impression from the Articles and statements of the British officials that supposedly Russia refused to cooperate with Britain that is how the media are showing that Russia has made a request to Britain asking for any information which could be used to exchange to exchange our views so materials or contacts or experts or delegations anything Russia suggested that we used a relevant article of the Chemical Weapons Convention we send all of this to Britain with no response no development still and even now we are waiting we are reaffirming our interest in obtaining information from London in order to begin working on this issue answering the questions making comments asking questions not ringing directly on this situation this is the solution to the situation how can we knock on the door which is not simply shot which is barricaded which is reinforced trying to shout something from behind it we're still standing and waiting for someone to answer perhaps not the way we asked for it perhaps there is another way of answering perhaps you do not want to send diplomatic notes all right send your experts we can exchange opinions give us the samples receive our experts any option suitable we can accept anything how did this begin they did not provide information they did not ask questions they did not address the specialized organizations they began speaking in the Parliament this is absurdity they're playing for the materia audience apparently they do not need an explanations of clarifications the position has already been made clear in the parliament remembering the three speeches in a row so there is one ounce I can give to your question everything is for unblocking the situation is in the hands of Britain we've sent our request to Britain and they can provide the information but they are not doing that they're hiding it classifying it perhaps it it's done for a reason yes please but cover what is English I have two questions will Russia recognized the results of what the examinations carried out by the OPCW and is Russia complying with the requirements I didn't understand about Russian and aerial strikes in the de-escalation zone in Elam the second question is should be addressed to the Ministry of Defence and as for the first question you know we have international law and it's in framework there are instruments for resolving and sometimes tragic situations and dangerous ones we have the OPCW we have the convention where all the methods and regulations for solving such issues are outlined the first thing that we did we started to review these instruments and we want with it Russia to be to take part in analyzing the material and studying and if you ask how do you assess what the can be done well how can you assess the results actually we have all Russian experts who can be working on that issue why are they not allowed to work I mean personally I do not understand this so this is the problem they do not let us do this on bilateral basis we do not have and see any desire we actually see obstacles in this participation to this participation in the OPCW framework what are you talking about right now so we like using poker terms about we are speaking about the cards or dealing with serious things on the tertiary of Britain as Brittany says the chemicals were applied were used we have heard that but we didn't get any material so what our results that we are talking about so wait a minute it is not understandable so what was the axis to whom was the axis provided to the OPCW experts whom the examined no we do not understand because this is the citizens of Russian Federation only the Russian Federation can identify them so can you explain us what documents were shown and what people they were shown so do you have these materials we do not have anything how good experts of the International Organization how can they identify a particular person according to the resume this persons are half conscience they cannot speak and the state of health can will not be recovered totally in the future so this is again you asked us whether we would accept the results of this game when we ask you I do not admit a statement out for the Russian Federation that we have nothing to do with it but we want to receive the materials is it a game like that it was in Iraq or is it a serious talk maybe by that time someone would approach Colin Powell and ask him to give a sample that he was showing if he had given that sample we would have avoided a great deal of victims and we would have a way invaded this war so let's start with simple things if we speak about trust let's talk about the formula the sample of the substance is it difficult to transfer a sample of the substance that they have and why Great Britain refuses to interact to maintain dialogue with the Russian Federation no one knows answer to this question we only can suppose that it is a part of a plan not to communicate if you do not communicate a youth will not answer questions you are not obliged to present anything any evidence so what should we believe in we should believe in the pictures in the samples what the decision or the statement so that the agent that should be similar to some other agent so it is similar to some other family of these substances everything that was published during the three lost recent weeks this substance can be produced almost in every average laboratory if there are materials and documents on how it what happened on how this was received in Great Britain what should we then trust and what should we believe in it is like samples that we are asked to believe in in their presentation they were speaking about the Malaysian boy this is a very similar situation because we were accused at the first time from the very beginning and then we asked them to collect the debris and they said that we asked to collect more but they said they had enough so we blame you but we do not let you participate in this investigation the very big in Malaysian was not lot to take part in the investigation we saw one of the case one the sample that was presented was fake we want to see the materials we want to see the data and want to see the official position now we see show provocations and political rhetoric that's all and the same thing is presented to you anything that we have now is a presentation six pictures and a headline yes please second second time yeah good day Korean radio and telecommunication NAT I would like to ask two questions the first one is about the meetings with the representative alpha Korean Peninsula is will be the visit of the DPRK minister to Moscow and the second these contexts are possible and as for the level and the status of all these meetings will be confirmed and we will do it soon in the future and the second issue this week the China ministers visit should have happened what are the reasons and their reasons are quite obvious this is the change in the shadow of our leadership because we had a national mourning announced in our country and I'd like to state once again that we published the corresponding comments on our website and we think our Chinese colleagues who understood it right and expressed condolences to the Russian side yes please good day you see john houseman ambassador of the earth did rule out the rest of russian property and as it's in the u.s. connected to which is connected to this group ours case will Russia a suit file suited to the court if it happens if it happens it will be analyzed I will give we will give for the corresponding reaction and we cannot speak and command on what is actually going or not going to happen so for taking such decisions one needs real evidence if the USA has it then we asked her to give us to present it to us and to the US ambassador said that the presentation contains all of these evidence and you saw it and we taken it as something very strange and like has nothing to deal with the any kind of evidence yes please good afternoon maria vladimirovna kind of i would like to express condolences on the occasion of this tragedy in camera and it is known that on the 25th on 28th of march our leaders leader came to names visit the DPRK and how can you assess how this historic event we believe that the contacts between countries that are on equal and adjusted basis as to be an important element of international relations and we believe that any advance in the region that can defuse the tensions in the Korean Peninsula this is this process is welcome I have seen such information but if this visit included such moment in its program it can be welcomed in itself and of course the exchange of delegation and the visits are rocketed for four sovereign states usually we use the diplomatic practice of not commenting on the affairs of sovereign states but in this case we can say that such events on the highest levels can contribute to developing bilateral ties and also to stabilizing in the Karenia Korean peninsular situation so any other questions yes please Congo son of tiger at a TV channel morality merimna they expelled the diplomats Russian diplomats they are called special agencies special services agents watch all the aims that are behind it and in many Western media they camera events are covered in a quiet relatively away and in particular in Bloomberg is it an attempt of our Western partners to stabilize the situation internal situation in Russia as for the expulsion of the deployments I have answered quite extensively today and these people got a gray deviation as the diplomatic workers and they had diplomatic immunity so I think I can have nothing to add about that as for that the were considered special services agents you know we have diplomatic practice and if anyone wants to label persons and invent such things then it is obvious about of of the campaign that is conducted we usually and always call such persons only diplomatic workers and this would not there any good fruit to the bilateral relations with its countries and both to the international relations as for the camera camera accident and the corresponding publication I do not know what your publication you're referring to this is disgusting when people trying to suit their own political interests in this situation of tragedy and our own country was shocked by this catastrophe by this tragedy and for punishing those culpable and as for helping those who suffered such a grief I watch TV no it's a particular and I have never seen such a situation then there are no indifferent people when people are really suffering and as for always tough we were watching these rules with a broken hearts and cannot imagine a person who could be indifferent not feel there's grief in his own heart to use this situation for the vested interests this all is nothing compared to the grief that the bird the people had to undergo maybe this is was this was a private article and I even cannot imagine that journalists can write something like that rent even off we have talked much about the presentation about these six slides so this level of organizing does it tell about the level of British analysts and they didn't even command on that yeah this is a campaign when all means are used and the quality of these presentations tells us not about the intellectual level it is this level is shown by the statement of Warren Johnson for instance when he talks about Russian ambassador expelled from EU when actually the euro has withdrawn its his its own ambassador from Russia so what's the difference how many slides are shown dear what's the difference if we change our public statements because we speak that it is highly likely that Russia has done that and in this light that there is 100 certainty about that so we should only make others express their solidarity this is a proof that the stake is a placed on the United States a position and the pressure very sense of minimis Bulgaria we would like express our condolences that we transferred to you I would like also to thank for their condolences that were voiced 2003 in people's friendship University of 43 people were injured work there were 43 victims and some persons were arrested but now it's very surprising we do not know the reality is what really happened at the time and no conclusions master how much maybe they were not drawn because the tragedy was repeated in camera our presidential administration we had an attempt all for seizing part of our territory at the same time the president of Turkey restored the torture in Istanbul do not what do you think why the Turkish president does more for stirring the Orthodox churches than Russia so for the first question then I can say that Russia is going into they are the responsibility and as for the second part I can say that I will clarify the official information and then presented to you yes please international media outlet Bulgarian media I have several questions first will Russia take steps to return their citizens Sergei in u.s. crippled because since the Great Britain does not provide any information about their medical condition maybe they are hostages there and there the British there against their will are there any mechanisms to return them to the Russian Federation this was the first question the second question my colleague girl from Bulgaria asked about the fact that our ambassador was summoned but I need to say that we have investigation much more detailed one and then the presentation prepared by the Great Britain our journalists continued its work about the investigation about the military biological activities conducted by they so the the United States yesterday they published information in Russian and in English I think that experts should take it into account I'm sorry for asking this question for quite a long question because I think experts need take into account this investigation this was a serious work conducted by our journalists this investigation says that the Great Britain doesn't want to cooperate and this fact is explained by the financing of the laboratory by Pentagon and the Great Britain they allocate great sums so who is responsible today over the control of the chemical weapons so these investigation covers all these questions it's supposed in the investigation that that those who accuse Russia might be involved in the poisoning of the scruples this investigation contains contracts of the Defense Ministry of the United States maybe the United Nations could summon the extraordinary session to discuss the scruples case and know so that countries won't be able to take measures that they don't want to take s football Gary I wanted to say that Bulgarian position remains unchanged we pursue the policy our president strengthened that we're not going to expel the Russian diplomats thank you I want to ask you what were the questions once again I will repeat my questions first will Russia undertaking his chaps to return these cripples to Russia Russia has requested the Great Britain to provide them access to the Russian citizens we are convincing them to do that we are talking about that in a car in a constantly and we are talking about it publicly since they are not hearing us and the second there was an investigation it contains information it might be confirmed by the experts as for the Bulgarian investigation that you were talking about it would be pleasure for me to examine it because I don't have any information about that we'll send it to us for the use of international organizations we have been talking about it for many days the understanding that the United Nations has all the tools and mechanisms to investigate this matter in a comprehensive way we've been talking about it but you know we proceed from the fact that investigation should be comprehensive it should be based on the legal norms you can not use force you cannot use pressure in your investigation that is that's the thing we advocate for the participation of international organizations for us it's very interesting what exactly happened in Salisbury and we want we don't want to leave it as a detective scenario that happened on the British territory do you have any more questions yes please honestly I didn't want to ask that question but you have the second chance because I was inspired by the question posed to my colleague my colleague was talking about the crisis of the Russian credibility you mentioned the anniversary of the Yugoslavia bombing we know the consequences you know the converses you know the consequences but I'm not sure that this person is aware of that it's evident you know no one today knows who started the Second World War I was watching social polls in the US and people there were saying that it was Russia who started the second world war there are BBC journalists I still hope because this is a Russian journalist but the fact that uranium was was used in Yugoslavia that children were suffering when they were dying usually people know about this when they visit Belgrade because when they Wizard build write they understand what happened that they left ministry in several buildings as they had been during the bombing campaign the Chinese journalists know what happened there because Chinese diplomats died there they remember that but why anyone else would need to remember that it started as a provocation and it ended as a tragedy and as a representative of I don't remember on what level they Serb an embassy was represented but he said that the tragedy when people lost their friends and families they said that they could not go just on the European streets because they can't they don't know how to work on the streets because they still remember that bombs were falling on the streets but because of the uranium that was in that warheads this area is still contaminated and people suffer from there is this diseases so the question is how to leave after that because this question in Serbia is still relevant the relevant resolution was adopted to 1244 in the UN Security Council the NATO contigent was sent to the Kosovo territory there was the Russian constant what also present there but then they withdrew from the territory they're still servants who leave on that territory and so credibility and security is ensured by the West countries in Kosovo there are NATO forces and Alex you know Kosovo this is a horrible thing you know since we're talking about credibility here in several years after the United States gathered that solidarity coalition when they built this coalition when they dismembered that sovereign state and separated a quasi-state on the Kosovo territory and investigation was conducted there there were declarations made by Carlo ponder there were so many books written about all the atrocities that were taking place there so Kosovo received its statehood in several years Barack Obama says that it's true because referendum was organized in Kosovo what credibility we're talking about here who cannot believe the US president will suffer so this is a credibility that is imposed by foes you don't have referendum then you will have it in future this is a new reality that we live in today so three days ago there was another violence that was committed against Serbian servants living in Kosovo so how to leave after that because the elects mission which is in charge of the security and the NATO forces that are present there there are international documents there there is this Brussels document that was signed in 2013 what should know how subin's could leave there you know we have commented there for so many times are not going to touch upon that because Lavrov has recently visited will Belgrade and he expressed his assessments on that matter so if you allow me I can talk about it next riffing thank you bye Oh
