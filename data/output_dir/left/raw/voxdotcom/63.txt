1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:04,480
Zip, zilch, nil, nada, nothing.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,859
We have a lot of words to describe zero.

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,880
A number without which we wouldn’t have
the likes of James Bond

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,060
or the code that makes this video play on
YouTube...

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,499
It’s a number that came into existence only
1,500 years ago,

6
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,920
a blip in the evolution of humans.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,980
Yet, it’s considered one of the most important
discoveries in our history …

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,200
But if you ask a kid under the age of 6 ...

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,219
“Arthur, do you know what zero means?”

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:38,550
“Uh…”

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,180
“A number?”

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,860
“It’s none.”

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,489
They might be able to tell you that zero is
nothing,

14
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:52,499
but they don’t understand that it is a quantity
like other number, a concept that even a tiny

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,340
bumblebee can learn.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,560
“There’s nothing there.”

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,720
Children understand the natural counting numbers
long before they understand the number zero.

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,460
Mom: "Can you show me how to get to zero if you have one cookie?"

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,520
“Now how many cookies do you have?”

20
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:51,390
Andreas Nieder believes that humans must comprehend
four distinct stages of zero to fully understand

21
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,390
the number ...

22
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,270
The first stage is simple: the ability to
notice a stimulus or the lack of one.

23
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,429
When you turn on a light bulb, for example,
your eyes recognize the presence of that light

24
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,189
and send visual information to the brain.

25
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,020
Without light, the neurons don’t do anything.

26
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,790
So in the second stage, our brain has to learn
how to react to nothing.

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,350
The third stage is tougher: understanding
that zero is less than one.

28
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,380
And it’s this stage that kids struggle with.

29
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,540
Because even when a toddler can understand
that zero represents something, like the absence

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,490
of a cookie, they still don’t understand
that it represents an actual quantity.

31
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,280
In an experiment with four year olds ... researchers
asked the toddlers to pick cards with the

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,490
fewest dots, and when they compared a blank
card and a card with one dot, less than half

33
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,030
of the kids got the answer right.

34
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,270
Without understanding this concept, Nieder
says humans can’t use zero as a number,

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,020
the fourth and final stage.

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,100
Mom: If you had one cookie and you took it
away how many do you have?

37
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,160
Miriam: Two!

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Mom: Two?!

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,120
But how the brain gets to that point is still
unknown.

40
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:14,330
So while our own brains may still be a mystery,
researchers are finding answers in some seriously

41
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,720
less complex ones.

42
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:24,540
The brain of a bee has 100,000 times fewer
neurons than the brain of a human, yet scientists

43
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,510
in Australia were able to teach them that
zero is a quantity less than one.

44
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,950
Scarlett Howard: “One of the things we wanted
to test for was this concept of zero that

45
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:39,410
we see in these seemingly more advanced animals
like primates and parrots.

46
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,760
And so we did and we got a really interesting
answer.”

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,330
In a study similar to the one done with the
young kids, researchers presented bees with

48
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,100
cards showing different numbers of dots.

49
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,410
And the bees were rewarded with sugar water
when they selected the card with the smallest

50
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,410
amount.

51
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,320
After the bee correctly chose the smaller
number 80 percent of the time, the researchers

52
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,090
upped the challenge.

53
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,350
They added blank cards to the test.

54
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,000
Howard: “So the important thing from this
first experiment show us that bees that were

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,090
trained to always choose the lower number
in training, regardless of not having seen

56
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,620
an empty set before and never having been
rewarded for it, chose the empty set.”

57
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,380
Bees also showed that they understood zero

58
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,550
as a quantity on the number line, because they more accurately

59
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,199
chose the empty set when comparing it to a
larger number like five or six than when they

60
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,889
compared it to just one.

61
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,099
Howard: “They're more accurate with numbers
that are further apart, which is called “numerical

62
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,210
distance effects.”

63
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,439
And it's something that's defined as being
very important to show that an animal or even

64
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,210
a human has an understanding of number quantity.

65
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,300
The findings of this study suggest the ability
to understand zero may be more widespread

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,710
in the animal kingdom than previously thought.

67
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,580
And, it’s possible that in deconstructing
how the bees compute numbers, we could make

68
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,160
better, more efficient computers one day.

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,080
Plus, studying the brains of bees and other
animals can help scientists better learn how

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,620
humans understand zero, enough to do our algebra
homework — or just look for more cookies.

71
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,440
Mom: “What is nothing?”

72
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,729
Who knew that nothing could this complicated?

73
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:30,480
