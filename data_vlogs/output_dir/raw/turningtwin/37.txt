00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,720
[Teagan]Basically what that is were going to be doing a series of tricks and

15
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,740
[Sam]obviously we have to try and stick the landings of each trick. and if you stick the trick, so you don't wobble out of it or walk out of it you get the point

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,160
yeah so obviously the person with the most points at the end wins the stick it challenge.
