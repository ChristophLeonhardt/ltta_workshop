here's what I'm really hot and bothered about today president Trump yesterday was doing an event with a bunch of sheriffs from all over the country and one of the sheriffs mentioned ms-13 and President Trump responded in this way here's clip three country trying to come and was stopping a lot of them but we're taking people out of the country you wouldn't believe how bad these people these are people these are animals and we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before okay so here is the reality what Trump was specifically specifically talking about was ms-13 because the line that led up to this was a sheriff saying we can't actually deport ms-13 people they line leading up to this there's a sheriff named Mims who said thank you there could be an ms-13 member I know about if they don't reach a certain threshold I cannot tell ice about it and then Trump responded to the ms-13 reference by saying we have people coming into the country but we're taking people out of the country you wouldn't believe how bad these people are these aren't people these are animals so how did the media cover this he's specifically talking about ms-13 it is obvious that he's talking about ms-13 it is clear that he's talking about ms-13 and that's thirteen actual tagline I mean this is their actual marketing lines that are members is rape steal control these are not good people they are in fact as close to animals as you'll find in human beings so how did the media report this let me show you how the media report this here's the New York Times who this is what they tweeted out Trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a White House meeting calling those trying to breach the country's borders animals no he didn't he did not lash out at all illegal immigrants he lashed out at ms-13 and they are animals there have been several stories in the last couple of years about ms-13 members literally ripping hearts out of bodies while the people are still alive beheading their political enemies bringing drugs into the country and those 13 are some of the worst people on planet earth if the if the descriptor animal does not apply to ms-13 and legitimately applies to no one and yet the media are trying to plate as though Trump is not talking about ms-13 instead Trump was talking about illegal immigrants at large Ellison Trump has had some bad stuff about illegal immigration generally he's been over broad in his language that's not what happened here what happened right here was that he was ripping on ms-13 and the media decided to deliberately take him out of context and it wasn't just the New York Times it was c-span it was CNN it was the New York Times was the Washington Post they all decided to report this as though Trump was talking about illegal immigrants more broadly they were lying they were lying
