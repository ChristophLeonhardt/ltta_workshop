1
00:00:01,374 --> 00:00:01,673
PLAY.

2
00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:06,144
FOCUS OF TONIGHT’S ANGLE.

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:08,447
THE DEMOCRATS AND MANY ON THIS

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,282
THE LEFT WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK

5
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:11,550
TO KILL BRETT KAVANAUGH’S

6
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,985
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT.

7
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:16,522
BUT I THINK THEY MADE A FAY

8
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:17,122
NATURAL MISCALCULATION.

9
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:17,890
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY ALONG

10
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:19,091
THE WAY TO JETTISON THE

11
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:21,493
PRINCIPLE OF DUE PROCESS, AND TO

12
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:23,595
USE VICTIMS TO PURSUE A RADICAL
PRINCIPLE OF DUE PROCESS, AND TO

13
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:23,596
USE VICTIMS TO PURSUE A RADICAL

14
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:24,897
POLITICAL AGENDA.

15
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:26,765
ON THE FIRST YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF

16
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:29,168
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, I THINK

17
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,569
IT’S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

18
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,172
THIS ALL STARTED WITH LIBERAL

19
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:34,707
DEMOCRAT HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

20
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:38,811
FRIEND OF BILL AND HILLARY, AND

21
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:39,512
OF COURSE BARACK OBAMA, AND

22
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,046
REMEMBER HE, THE HOLLYWOOD

23
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:42,548
MOGUL, MEGADONOR.

24
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,649
I MEAN THIS GUY IS WHERE IT ALL

25
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,917
HAPPENED.

26
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:47,787
AND, REMEMBER, THE ABUSE THERE

27
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:49,288
STARTED THE CULTURAL MOMENT OF

28
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,656
"ME TOO."

29
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:52,291
THIS NOTION OF OBJECT TY FIEING

30
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,560
WOMEN AND USING THEM FOR THE

31
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,329
PLEASURE OF THE POWERFUL HAS

32
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,498
BEEN LONG NURTURED BY THE LEFT.

33
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,066
AT THE SAME TIME IT WAS ALSO

34
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,501
PRO-WOMEN AS WE ABUSE WOMEN ON

35
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:03,903
THE CASTING COUCH, ET CETERA.

36
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:05,171
AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, HAD

37
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:07,073
THE TARGET ON ITS BACK.

38
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:09,309
BUT NOW WE SEE THE SAME

39
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,976
MENTALITY AT PLAY IN THE

40
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:12,712
KAVANAUGH STRUGGLE.

41
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:14,881
CLAIMING TO BE DEFENDERS OF

42
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:16,849
WOMEN, THE DEMOCRATS CYNICALLY

43
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,852
AND I THINK CRUELLY USE

44
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:20,353
CHRISTINE FORD IN A DESPERATE

45
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:21,254
ATTEMPT TO DERAIL A SUPREME

46
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,157
COURT NOMINEE.

47
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:27,527
REMEMBER, SHE DIDN’T IISH IN

48
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:27,528
REMEMBER, SHE DIDN’T IISH

49
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:29,229
INIALLY WANT TO COME FORWARD,

50
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,997
SHE WAS DRAGGED INTO THE OPEN BY

51
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:31,931
POLITICAL LIKES TO THE

52
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:32,632
"WASHINGTON POST" AND OTHER

53
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,568
MEDIA OUTLETS.

54
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,002
REPORTERS SURROUNDED HER HOME,

55
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:37,637
AND THEN SHE WAS FORCED TO TELL

56
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:39,706
HER STORY.

57
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:42,576
AND TODAY, WE LEARNED OF MORE

58
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:43,977
DIRTY TRICKS FROM THE ACTIVIST

59
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,046
LAWYERS BEHIND THE SCENES.

60
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:48,482
REMEMBER LELAND KIZER?

61
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,050
SHE WAS THE PERSON WHO FORD

62
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,918
CLAIMED WAS AT THE PARTY WHERE

63
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:52,619
KAVANAUGH ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTED

64
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,186
HER.

65
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:55,155
ONE OF HER CLOSE FRIENDS.

KAVANAUGH TO BEGIN WITH.

71
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:06,800
TODAY, THOUGH, SHE TOLD THE

00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:07,735
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" THAT IN --

73
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:13,140
ANOTHER FRIEND OF FORDED,

AND THE FBI THAT A FORMER AGENT,

PRESSURED HER TO CHANGE HER

78
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,614
UNBELIEVABLE.

CONFIRMATION TODAY, SUSAN

83
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:29,190
COLLINS PERFECTLY SUMMED UP THE

84
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,426
CALLOUSNESS OF THE DEMOCRATS.

85
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:35,196
>> SOME PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO

86
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,232
ENGINEER THE DEFEAT OF THIS

87
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:42,069
NOMINATION CARED LITTLE, IF AT

88
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,642
ALL, FOR HER WELL BEING.

89
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:49,677
FORD TESTIFIED THAT A LIMITED

90
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:52,347
NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAD ACCESS TO

91
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:54,148
HER LETTER.

92
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:58,086
YET THAT LETTER FOUND ITS WAY

93
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:01,589
INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

94
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,957
>> Laura: TODAY DIANNE FEINSTEIN

LEFT NO DOUBT AS TO WHAT THE

96
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:06,895
BATTLE WAS ABOUT ALL ALONG.

97
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,898
THE LEFT’S DESIRE TO USE THE

98
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,599
SUPREME COURT TO IMPOSE LIBERAL

99
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,436
SOCIAL VALUES ON SOCIETY.

00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,973
GREAT PAUSE, IS JUDGE

KAVANAUGH’S EXTREME VIEW ON

103
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,041
GUNS.

104
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,743
THE CHALLENGING REALITIES WOMEN

105
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,245
FACE.

106
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,013
ROW V. WADE, WHAT KIND OF

107
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:27,816
MEDICAL CARE CAN YOU RECEIVE.

108
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:28,517
>> Laura: THIS HAS BEEN A

109
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,786
PROBLEM FOR DECADES.

110
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:31,853
THE AMERICAN LEFT BELIEVES THE

111
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:33,789
COURT SHOULD BE A SUPER

112
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,357
LEGISLATURE, A BODY THAT MAKES

113
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:38,193
LAW RATHER THAN INTERPRETS LAW.

114
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:40,495
SINCE TRUMP ANNOUNCED HIS

115
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,897
CANDIDACY THE LEFT HAS BEEN IN

116
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:43,632
PERPETUAL RAGE MODE.

117
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,333
AND OF COURSE THIS CONTINUED

118
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:45,701
INTO THE NIGHT.

119
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:46,802
AND IT’S GOING ON GO ON FOR SOME

120
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:48,470
TIME.

121
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:50,639
THIS IS HOW THE THEY ATTEMPTED

122
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,874
TO INFLUENCE SUSAN COLLINS

123
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,875
BEFORE SHE ANNOUNCED HER VOTE.

124
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:58,547
CHECK IT OUT.

125
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:01,684
[ALL YELLING AT THE SAME TIME]

126
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,519

127
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,819
COURT!

128
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:13,229
DON’T PUT A LIAR ON THE COURT!

129
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,098
>> Laura: AH, NICE.

130
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,599
THIS IS HOW THEY WORK THEIR

131
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,134
CHARMS ON DEMOCRAT JOE MANCHIN

132
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,302
AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HE WAS

133
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:22,138
SUPPORTING KAVANAUGH.

134
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,073
>> SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME,

135
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:27,110
SHAME, SHAME!

136
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:28,444
>> Laura: AT LEAST IT’S A

137
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:30,613
ONE-WORD CHANT, EASY TO FOLLOW.

138
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:32,515
YOU KNOW WHAT IS SHAMEFUL?

139
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:34,584
DEMOCRATS WHO USE VICTIMHOOD AS

140
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,619
THEIR DEFINING PRINCIPLE.

141
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,755
THEY’D RATHER HAVE PEOPLE

142
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:39,656
DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT,

143
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:41,658
HELPLESS WITHOUT IT, ESPECIALLY

144
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,561
CERTAIN GROUPS, MINORITIES,

145
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:46,296
IMMIGRANTS, AND EVEN WOMEN.

146
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:47,797
WE’RE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT

147
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,899
WE CAN’T SURVIVE AND THRIVE

148
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,935
WITHOUT AN ACTIVIST COURT MAKING

149
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:53,003
UP NEW RIGHTS, FINDING THEM IN

150
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:54,170
THE CONSTITUTION.

151
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:57,841
ANYONE WHO CLAIMS VICTIM STATUS.

152
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:59,242
AND THEY DEMAND THAT WE BELIEVE

153
00:04:59,243 --> 00:04:59,243
ANYONE WHO CLAIMS VICTIM STATUS.

154
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:01,278
WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM AT THEIR

155
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,112
WORD REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE

156
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,947
FACTS LIE.

157
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:06,416
BUT FOR ALL OF THEIR SCREAMING

158
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,518
AND TIRESOME CHANTING, THE LEFT

159
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,252
BASICALLY COME UP EMPTY THIS

160
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:11,154
TIME.

161
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:12,255
MOST AMERICANS DON’T SEE

162
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:13,824
THEMSELVES AS VICTIMS.

163
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:16,727
WE’RE NOT POWERLESS OR WEAK.

164
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:18,695
WE’RE STRONG AND INDEPENDENT.

165
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:20,197
THIS WAS THE DEMOCRATS’

166
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:22,065
MISCALCULATION.

167
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:25,903
THEY THOUGHT EMOTIONAL EXTORTION

168
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,372
AND PROTESTER HISTRIONICS TO

BLOCK A WELL QUALIFIED SUPREME

COURT NOMINEE.

171
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:34,645
ONCE AGAIN, THEY LET THEIR RABID

00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:35,980
POLITICAL IDEOLOGY BLIND THEM TO
ONCE AGAIN, THEY LET THEIR RABID

173
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,281
POLITICAL IDEOLOGY BLIND THEM TOTHE FACT THAT THE AMERICANS ARE

00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:37,282
THE FACT THAT THE AMERICANS ARE

175
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,116
FAIR MINDED, HAVE A BASIC

00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:40,484
GOODNESS ABOUT THEM, AND THEY’RE

177
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:42,486
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE.

178
00:05:42,487 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON’T NEED AN ACTIVIST
