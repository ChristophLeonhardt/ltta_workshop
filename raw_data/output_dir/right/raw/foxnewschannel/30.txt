1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:03,642
JOHN BRENNAN WORKS FOR MSNBC,

2
00:00:03,643 --> 00:00:06,645
NOT CNN.

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:09,848
A REALLY SAD DAY FOR THE COUNTR

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:10,582
COUNTRY, THE PRESIDENT LOOKING

5
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,517
VERY SAD AND SOMBER AT THE

6
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:13,552
WHITE HOUSE, NOW HE'S GOT A BIG

7
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:17,456
RALLY TONIGHT, TURN OUT THE BASE

8
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:18,690
FOR THE MIDTERMS.

9
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,958
A TOUGH SITUATION FOR THE

10
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,993
COUNTRY AND FOR THE PRESIDENT

11
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:27,999
AND BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,868
>> Dana:        >> ONE OF THE TI

13
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:29,901

00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,502

00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:30,535
>> Dana:        >> ONE OF THE TM

>> Dana:        >> ONE OF THE TY

22
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,338
NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY IS THE

23
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:33,672
PEOPLE.

24
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:36,508
I ALSO THINK, THIS IS A BIG

25
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:36,808
DEAL.

26
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,245
HE HAD JUST HAD A BRIEFING FROM

27
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:41,513
THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE,

28
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:43,014
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FBI, AND

29
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:44,149
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

30
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,516
SECURITY.

31
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:46,451
THEY ARE COORDINATING WITH THE

32
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,653
ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS,

33
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:49,788
AND THE NYPD, WASHINGTON, D.C.

34
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,757
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY

35
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:54,459
TRAIN FOR, THEY PLANNED FOR, IT

36
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,260
IS UNFORTUNATE.

37
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,462
THE GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA IS

38
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,064
THAT THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE, A

39
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:00,465
VERY GOOD INVESTIGATORS.

40
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,833
THEY HAVE GREAT LEADS, THE

41
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,136
ABILITY TO TRACK THIS DOWN,

42
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:04,936
PLUS, THANKFULLY, BECAUSE NONE

43
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:06,304
OF THESE DENTAL RANGES, THEY

44
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:09,040
HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO LOOK

45
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,942
THROUGH, FIND A FINGERPRINT,

46
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:12,277
CROSS-CHECK WITH SOCIAL MEDIA

47
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:12,577
POSTS.

48
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:14,846
I'M NOT TRYING TO DOWNPLAY IT.

49
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:15,547
IT'S EXTREMELY SERIOUS, THERE

50
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:19,584
COULD BE MORE OUT THERE, BUT THE

51
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:22,854
FULL WEIGHT OF OUR INVESTIGATIVE

52
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:23,722
CAPABILITIES MAKES IT ALL THE

53
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,423
MORE LIKELY THAT THIS WILL BE

54
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:27,259
CAUGHT SOONER THAN LATER.

55
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,660
>> Jesse: HOPEFULLY AS SOON AS

56
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:29,027
POSSIBLE.

57
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:31,029
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE

58
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,965
TARGETS HERE, ALL HIGH PROFILE,

59
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:36,835
VERY HARSH CRITICS OF THIS

60
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:39,437
PRESIDENT, IT JUST A SERIES OF

61
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:40,238
MALE BOMBINGS TO THESE

62
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,673
INDIVIDUALS, DOES THIS MAKE ANY

63
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:42,107
SENSE TO YOU?

64
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:43,408
>> Greg: YOU CAN DRAW A NUMBER

65
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:43,875
OF CONCLUSIONS.

66
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:46,978
YOU CAN SAY, WELL, THIS IS

67
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,046
SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THESE

68
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:50,348
PEOPLE, BUT I WOULD SAY THIS IS

69
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,250
NOT A NORMAL ACT, SO DON'T ACT

70
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,019
LIKE IT'S A NORMAL ACT BY A

71
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,453
NORMAL PERSON TRIGGERED BY

72
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:55,854
RHETORIC.

73
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:58,924
IT IS AN ACT OF TERROR BY,

74
00:01:58,925 --> 00:01:59,624
LIKELY, A DERANGED PERPETRATOR

75
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,092
OR A GROUP.

76
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:03,929
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT STUFF LIKE

77
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,597
THAT, IT LOOKS ALMOST ALWAYS

78
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:06,832
LIKE IT IS A SINGLE PERSON.

79
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,534
BUT I AM A WEIGHT-AND-C GUY.

80
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:09,836
AT TIMES LIKE THIS

81
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,139
, YOU SHOULD HAVE LESS

82
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,641
SPECULATION, NOT MY SPECULATION.

83
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:17,676
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU ARE REQUIRED

84
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:19,978
TO FILL TIME AND SPECULATE, BUT

85
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,047
I REALIZE WHEN IT COMES TO MASS

86
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:23,381
SHOOTINGS AND SUSPICIOUS

87
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:24,416
PACKAGES AND CERTAIN EVENTS, THE

88
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,118
FIRST CONCLUSION IS OFTEN -- THE

89
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,286
FIRST CONCLUSION ON TWITTER IS

90
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:29,421
NEVER THE RIGHT ONE.

91
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:31,223
THE GUY THAT COMES OUT FIRST

92
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:32,991
USUALLY ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE AN

93
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:33,291
IDIOT.

94
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:36,161
YOU NEED LESS SPECULATION,

95
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:36,862
THAT'S BETTER.

96
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:38,830
I WANT TO SAY THIS IS AN

97
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,632
ILLUSTRATION, HOW EASY IT IS TO

98
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,267
DISRUPT A FREE SOCIETY WITH FEAR

99
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:43,001
AND PANIC.

100
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:44,202
ONE PERSON OR A HANDFUL OF

101
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:47,038
PEOPLE CAN HAVE AN IMPACT OF

102
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,642
MILLIONS WITH BOXES, PIPES, AND

103
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:51,443
POSTAGE.

104
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:52,377
I THINK THE UPSIDE OF THIS IS

105
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:55,847
THAT IT IS SO SHOCKING BECAUSE

106
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,415
IT'S RARE, AND WE HAVE TO REMIND

107
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,819
OURSELVES IT SHOCKS US, BECAUSE

108
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,520
BACK IN THE 1970s, THIS WASN'T

109
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:04,022
RARE.

110
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:05,457
THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM.

111
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,026
THEY WERE ACTUAL TERROR GROUPS,

112
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:08,827
DOMESTIC TERROR GROUPS, MORE

113
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:11,429
THAN A HANDFUL OF THEM, WHO WERE

114
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,265
SETTING BOMBS, PIPE BOMBS,

115
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,666
TRYING TO KILL POLICE OFFICERS,

116
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:18,270
THIS WAS A REGULAR THING IN THE

117
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,538
EARLY '70s, MITT '70s.

118
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,674
SO THIS IS A RARE, DISGUSTING

119
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:23,008
EVENTS.

120
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,476
IT IS AN ACT OF TERROR.

121
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,845
BUT TO GO AND TRY TO SPECULATE

122
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:28,246
ON ANYTHING WITHOUT FIRST HAVING

123
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:29,981
AN ARREST OR SUSPECT, I WOULD

124
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:31,249
STAY AWAY FROM IT.

125
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,052
>> Jesse: I THINK RECENTLY

126
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:35,253
TRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS RECEIVED

127
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:36,955
WHITE POWDER IN THE MAIL, AND

128
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:39,991
TRUMP CABINET MEMBERS RECEIVED

129
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,860
RICIN, BUT THIS TAKES IT TO A

130
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,828
WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL WHEN YOU

131
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,196
LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRATIC

132
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:47,766
OFFICEHOLDERS, FORMER PRESIDENT

133
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,000
PRESIDENTS, FORMER

134
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,403
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S, AND GEORGE

135
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:53,838
SOROS IS VERY, VERY INFLUENTIAL

136
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,572
PERSON IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

137
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:55,273
IN TERMS OF FUND-RAISING AND

138
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:56,041
THINGS LIKE THAT.

139
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,243
WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT TODAY'S

140
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:58,543
EVENT?

141
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:00,412
>> Juan: WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU

142
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:01,279
GUYS TALK ABOUT THE RALLY

143
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,714
TONIGHT AND HOW THE PRESIDENT

144
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,449
WOULD HAVE TO WALK A TIGHTROPE,

145
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,251
WHAT STRIKES ME IS THAT HIS

146
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:08,086
RHETORIC IS QUITE INCENDIARY AT

147
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:08,753
THESE EVENTS.

148
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,689
I DON'T THINK THIS IS

149
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,823
REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS SUPPORTERS

150
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,758
ANYWAY, BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE

151
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,459
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HEAR HIM

152
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,828
VERY CLEARLY WHEN HE SAYS, OH,

153
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,264
THOSE DEMOCRATS, LOCK UP

154
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:20,432
HILLARY CLINTON, BARACK OBAMA,

155
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:21,566
HE IS NOT REALLY AN AMERICAN.

156
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,435
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO DO WITH

157
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:26,037
I.C.E., THEY DON'T WANT BORDERS.

158
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:28,039
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

159
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,707
TURN AMERICA INTO IT -- THE

160
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,074
RHETORIC.

161
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,241
AND HE IS THE ONE WHO ALWAYS

162
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:31,876
SAID, GO AHEAD AND PUNCH THEM.

163
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:34,212
I'LL PAY YOUR LEGAL BILLS.

164
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:34,946
THE BIG PROBLEM AROUND HERE IS

165
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:36,881
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HURT

166
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:37,449
ANYONE ANYMORE.

167
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,050
THAT KIND OF RHETORIC, I DON'T

168
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:44,255
CARE IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN ARE

169
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:45,223
DEMOCRAT, THAT DOESN'T CITE

170
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:45,590
VIOLENCE.

171
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:48,026
A NUMBER PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, THE

172
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:49,260
INSTINCT, AND I THINK IT'S A

173
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:50,895
MISTAKE, WOULD BE TO JUMP AND

174
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:53,598
SAY, I KNOW EXACTLY THE FORCE OF

175
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:53,898
THIS.

176
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,468
>> Jesse: YOU JUST DID.

177
00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:00,271
YOU JUST SAID IT'S FREDERICK.

178
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,774
>> Juan: I THINK YOU AND DANA

179
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:03,641
BOTH SPOKE TO THIS.

180
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:06,211
HE USES FEAR TO STIR HIS FACE.

181
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,580
>> Jesse: YOU ARE IMPLYING

182
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:09,080
THAT BECAUSE THIS?

183
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,849
>> Juan: I AM IMPLYING THAT IS

184
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,583
THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN TODAY.

185
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,518
I THINK IT IS WHEN THE PANTS ARE

186
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,853
POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS PEOPLE

187
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:17,856
WHO ARE NOT AMERICANS, NOT

188
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,257
PATRIOTS, NOT WORTHY, AND

189
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:22,460
THEN IT INVITES THE KIND OF LOAN

190
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:24,362
ACTOR, SOMEONE WHO MAY DERANGED,

191
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:27,665
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS.

192
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,201
>> Jesse: IS THERE A LINE

193
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:30,635
BETWEEN THIS?

194
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:32,137
>> Emily: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

195
00:05:32,138 --> 00:05:33,705
TO JUAN, IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO

196
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:35,640
MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION, THAT

197
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:38,076
TITHER THAT RHETORIC CAUSES IT.

198
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:39,210
RECENTLY WE HAD A FORMER

199
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,446
DEMOCRATIC STAFFER THAT WAS

200
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:42,614
CHARGED WITH MULTIPLE FELONIES

201
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:43,815
FOR DOUSING THREE CENTERS.

202
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:47,218
YOU CAN'T ISOLATE NOT ONLY --

203
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:50,422
THAT BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT,

204
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,956
WE SHOULDN'T ISOLATE THIS, OR

205
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,458
SHOULD WE SHOULD INCLUDE A

206
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,960
LARGER SPECTRUM OF WHAT THIS ACT

207
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:05,837
MEANS.

208
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:06,471
SO THERE WAS AN EXPLOSIVE

209
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:06,805
DEVICE.

210
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:07,505
THERE WAS ALSO POWDER, AS HE

211
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:07,906
POINTED OUT.

212
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:08,606
THOSE ARE TRICK WITH DIFFERENT

213
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:08,940
THINGS.

214
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:09,674
WHEN I GOT MY DEATH THREAT IS A

215
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,375
FEDERAL ACTING DIRECTOR, I WAS

216
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,643
ABLE TO CALL IN FEDERAL SERVICE

217
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:12,410
SERVICES, OPD, THEY WERE ACTIVE

218
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:13,078
DOORSTEP WITHIN 30 MINUTES.

219
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,312
MY POINT IS, THE

220
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:17,215
THERE IS A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF

221
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,651
THEM, AND THEY TREAT EVERY

222
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:20,919
THREAT.

223
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,554
THE WORD "CREDIBLE THREAT,"

224
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:23,621
THAT'S A MISNOMER.

225
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:25,023
EVERY THREAT IS CREDIBLE.

226
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:27,559
NOTHING IS ISOLATED OR IGNORED,

227
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,327
AND THAT SPEAKS TO INTEGRITY OF

228
00:06:29,328 --> 00:00:00,000
THE SECRET SERVICE AND FBI.
