cartoon that came out in Politico if you want to know why there is a cultural divide in this country it's because even the things that ought to bring us together can still be used to tear us apart here is a cart that came out yesterday from Politico the author the creator of this this atrocity his name is matt worker i believe and if you can't see it what it shows is a helicopter with the the us low gaan trying to rescue a guy the guy is obviously supposed to be a texan right and he is sitting there in a shirt that is a confederate flag and a cowboy hat and boots for some reason his jeans are tucked into his boots I've never met a Texan who actually tucks his jeans into his boots but in any case he's there in a basket and next to him is a flag that says don't tread on me as he's being as he's being picked up from the waters and then the guy is shouting angels sent by God and then there's a house next to him and the water is up to the roof of the house and on top there is a sign that says secede like Texas secede and then a little girl on top of the roof and a rescuer who is trying to put a lifejacket on the little girl and it says or actually Coast Guard sent by the government and not angel sent by God Coast Guard sent by the government there are so many things wrong with this idiotic comic that it's almost impossible to hit them all number one let's begin with the the caricature of religious people this angel sent by God routine okay this is so intensely stupid I can't even tell you the reason this is so intensely stupid is because religious people don't actually believe that angels are going to save them from the water they believe that human beings can sometimes act as instruments of God's will in saving them okay there's a very famous religious joke every religious person knows this joke but for those who are not religious in the audience this is something religious people tell there's a religious person joke okay here's the joke and that good but here's the joke okay the joke is there's a flood and there's a guy who's trapped in the flood and so he prays to God he says God please send me help and next thing he knows a car drives up and says hop in dude it's time to get out of here and he says listen I've talked to God God is gonna send me help so the car drives away next thing it happens a boat comes up and the guy in the boat says jump in and the religious guy says no no I've prayed to God God will help me so that boat motors away and here comes Alex operand the helicopter comes and says to the religious guy dude jump in lower roped him he says no no God is gonna save me so naturally he drowns and then he goes up to heaven and he says to God hey I prayed where were you and God says I sent you a boat a car a boat and a helicopter what do you mean where was I okay that's how religious people actually think of this sort of thing so this idea that it's angels sent by God like they don't understand that it's actually the Coast Guard it can be both the Coast Guard and also human beings can act as angels in times of need in fact little known fact about Hebrew that our non-jewish friends probably don't know the word for the word for angel is Moloch in Hebrew the word for messenger in Hebrew is mala so human messenger an angel are the same exact word in Hebrew okay so just demonstrates there's an identity here human beings can act as messengers of the Lord even when they are acting in pursuit of their everyday duty so this had this idea that we're all just a bunch of religious morons is ridiculous second of all the idea that these guys weren't Confederate shirt and that means out obviously that he must be a racist redneck it's worth noting that the precincts that have been flooded in this in this hurricane voted for Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly overwhelmingly they voted for Hillary Clinton in fact the state of New Jersey voted in fewer numbers for Hillary Clinton than these districts did by percentage so it was a bunch of Democrats getting hit by this hurricane so they're ripping on the people of Texas as though they are uniformly Trump voters not even true okay finally when it says it's the Coast Guard sent by the government how dare how dare people in Texas think that the you know they want to secede okay let's be clear about this the vast majority of resources that are being brought to bear in Houston are local and state they are not federal resources federal resources provide the vast minority of support that means that even if Texas word ICICI do you think they really wouldn't have any sort of Coast Guard facilities Texas a very wealthy State Texas has done nuclear weapons in the international guard the idea that Texas is going to I mean they're under federal auspices but still the idea that Texas is going to go completely broke if it were to secede they wouldn't be able to rescue their own citizens is absolute nonsense considering the people who are actually rescuing their citizens are folks who are working for the state of Texas and just because you believe in state sovereignty just because you believe in state power under the Constitution does not mean they are against the the the government helping you out with your own taxpayer dollars I mean that's why we pay for fire services this is why we pay for the police so this cartoon is so stupid in every way but what it's really designed to do is suggest that Texans are just a bunch of loon bags you don't understand the beauty of governments if they just understood the power of government and beauty of government then they would get behind a bigger stronger government and spend more money and they wouldn't be these crazy Trump voters that they are that's what this cartoon is supposed to mean it's cruel it's nasty and it's stupid all at once it's especially stupid because the fact is that how are texans acting during this they're not sitting around waiting to be rescued this is a picture tweeted out by a radio host named Michael berry this is the twelve this is this is a picture of a bunch of people in Texas in line can you grab that it's okay there is okay so you can see the this giant line of people is that giant line of people people waiting to get services is that a giant line of people at a Food Bank no it turns out that these are these are a bunch of people in the center of Houston who are waiting in line to volunteer look at the size of that line hundreds of people waiting in line to volunteer those are the people that this idiot asshat Matt worker is ripping on in Texas okay those are the people of Texas those are the people who are helping each other out now Charlie Hebdo did exactly the same routine except more blatant Charlie Hebdo which is a at least their equal opportunity offender so they they went after Muslim Mohammed and Islam in such a way that they ended up as the target for for a terrorist attack a few years back as you recall Charlie Hebdo ran a cartoon that showed the that showed a bunch it says do you exist a I don't speak French I assume that means God exists and they are celebrating the flood because it's a bunch of people you can't see it but I'll describe it to you it's a bunch of hands going up in the Heil Hitler salute and a bunch of Nazi flags that are halfway under water suspension Nazis pour drowned and says the cover of the magazine is totally captioned God exists he drowned all the neo-nazis of Texas again the districts were a bunch of Democrats second the people of Texas are not neo-nazis this is insane the racial makeup of the city is not let me give you the racial makeup of the city of Texas according to the census of 2000 hey its 49.3% white which includes Hispanic ok 25% black or african-american so that means that this is one of the most diverse cities in America and they're saying that it's a bunch of white supremacist but again the left stereotypes have no end here they're really quite horrifying and disgusting you wonder why people react by saying that they'll vote for Trump it's because they're reacting to stupidity like this it's because they're reacting to grossing us like this okay so the truth is that the vast majority people are not reacting well to these sorts of cartoons even the left was was a little upset with with political revealing the hard left biases charlie hebdo's cartoon is not going over like gangbusters but it does demonstrate the cultural stereotyping that goes on in people in Texas that everybody thinks that people in Texas are a bunch of rednecks outside of Texas and that cultural divide is getting worse not better I mean to the point where when Chris Pratt the actor said at one point that Hollywood doesn't do a good job of appealing to blue-collar Americans outside the major cities and he was ripped up and down by the left and then forced to backtrack it's true how it was just a horrible job of demonstrating what it is for people who live outside the major cities because the vast majority of people who populate our pop culture our folks who are from major cities there are people from LA I've lived here my entire life people from New York people from Chicago they mostly come from big cities the myth of the person who comes from Kansas and hits it big in Hollywood it happens it's true but the vast majority of people who work in Hollywood are from Hollywood the vast majority of people who write are from New York or Hollywood the vast majority people making our entertainment are like that and that's why they have such scorn for people that they've never met halfway across the country who are suffering at this time okay so what dad said I think that also demonstrates now I get to talk about my favorite subject the all-female Lord of the Flies before I talk about all-female Lord of the Flies however I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at upside comm so if you are traveling and you need a

and of course you let them know that we sent you okay so here is what we know about when I say that Hollywood is out of touch I mean that Hollywood is seriously out of touch they're planning a movie that makes no sense the all-female Lord of the Flies why do I think this is important because I think that it is important to understand that the left's perverse and weird notion of what exactly men and women are boys and girls is exactly that it's weird and perverse so if you actually read Lord of the Flies it is a book about boys becoming men it is a book about what happens to boys in the absence of civilization it is a book about the violent nature of particularly men and it's funny that they'd want into an all-female version of this because the fact is that one of the things that feminists are constantly ripping about men is that men are violent right this is the routine we got from Hillary Clinton that if Hillary had been elected president there would never be another violent thing that happened ever because all wars in history have been men you get that routine from the feminists all the time but now they want to do Lord of the Flies which is based on physical violence being done between groups I guess that now that they've done the all-female Ghostbusters and that was such a smashing success and such a horrible movie and now Scott McGehee and David Siegel have made a deal and Warner's to direct a new version of Lord of the Flies they plan to be faithful to the novel with one major twist the young students stranded on a remote island who descend into a savage social order will be girls and so here's what they say in his corncob wha over a daily wire the woman David Siegel says we wanted to have very faithful but contemporized adaptation of the book first of all why would you have to do a contemporized adaptation of the book it's literally a bunch of boys stuck on an island does that need a lot of updating it's not like here it's not like you're updating Shakespeare or something and you have to up take the language it's like there are a bunch of cultural totems in Lord of the Flies literally there is a conch-shell that is the that is the entirety of the props in Lord of the Flies okay there's like a pig head that's pretty much it I guess they can have Lena there the glasses that's true Thank You Taylor there I guess that you could theoretically cast Lena Dunham as piggy which might make some sense but David Sigal says we wanted to a faithful but contemporized adaptations book says it is a timeless story that is especially relevant today with the interpersonal conflicts and bullying and the idea of children forming society and replicating the behavior they saw in grown-ups before they were marooned that really is not what the book is about the book is really not about that but if you've read the book the book is really not about them imitating the adults the point of the book is they get to the island and they realize there are no adults here we can do whatever we want that is the first three chapters of the book have they even read it the entire point of the book is that man without civilization descends into anarchy and violence that's the entire point of the stupid book and isn't that the book isn't stupid but this is ridiculous McGhee he says the subject matter is aggressively suspenseful and taking the opportunity to tell it in a way that hasn't been told before with girls rather than boys is that it shifts things in a way that might help people see the story anew it breaks away from some of the conventions the way we think of boys and aggression we don't think of boys and aggression boys are aggressive okay I have I have a girl and I have a boy the girl is three and a half years old she is calm she's delightful she's not aggressive I have a boy who is a year and a half old I love him very much he is awesome he also will beat the living crap out of you if you cross him okay he's a boy that's what they do it's just about the hacker because people still talk about the movie in the book from the standpoint of pure storytelling it is a great adventure story real entertainment but it has a lot of meaning embedded in it as well we've gotten to think about this a while as the right tool worked out and we're super eager to put pen to paper so they say this is just ridiculous okay a few things about this that are particularly ridiculous first of all boys and girls are not the same this is one of my pet peeves in film it's one of the reasons I think I said on the show atomic glue on fail I think the reason atomic lawn failed is because the character could have been a man and there would've been no difference to the story at all like legitimately down to the seduction of a woman there's literally no difference in in atomic blonde between her being a man and her be woman any movie where there's no difference in the main characters like an action movie that actually implicates the differences between men and women any movie that's that focuses on men and women being exactly substitutable being exactly the same it just does not work that way it's it's it doesn't work for the viewer because the viewer knows their differences between boys and girls here is the fact okay the movie would not work in any real sense because girls do not act the same as boys quick question for you how many physical fights not like yelling at each other and then crying on the phone fights like physical fights have most girls been in most girls have been in very very few physical fights defending vast majority of girls that I know haven't been in any physical fights how many fights have the vast majority of boys been in the answer is probably greater than five boys particularly young boys fight with each other all the time they have physical fights with each other their violence is that their their arguments escalate to physical aggression in short order in a way that girls don't girls don't sit around smacking each other in the face okay it's not what girls do when I was in law school there was a group of guys would legitimately go to bars get drunk and sock each other in the balls this was like their way of having fun okay the idea that that girls like I've never heard of girls doing this okay guys are much more aggressive than girls which is why guys join the army and murder each other this is why the vast majority of murderers in every culture in history have been men the idea that women and men are exactly the same is stupid they don't even group the same way you know what happened if a bunch of girls got stuck on an island together first of all they would actually share and talk about their feelings because they liked that stuff guys don't like that stuff half of the beginning of Lord of the Flies is the guys don't want to share feelings and piggy wants to share feelings so they murder him okay so that that's legitimately what happens in the book if a girl tries to share her feelings in an island with a bunch of other girls were just shipwrecks they will sit around and bond over this that's what they will do okay the beyond that girls don't tend to break into giant groups they don't break into giant tribes Thea there have been studies that have shown this there was one from the National Institute of Health that came out and just recently and what they found is that girls actually like to get together in sort of best friend forever circumstances they have a very close knit circle of friends right they have girls will have their best friend and that's it right guys will get together in packs and they roam in packs that's what they do because guys are basically just chimpanzees like male chimpanzees they walk around impact that's what happens in Lord of the Flies they break down into packs and then they fight each other because men are looking for physical safety from other men and so they band together to provide that physical safety for one another girls in the absence of guys are not deeply worried about other girls physically attacking them and so they only need somebody with whom they can visit with whom they can can spiritually and mentally bond that's what they are looking for this is why guys don't understand girls and girls don't understand guys when guys get angry when guys get upset guys get silent when girls get angry and upset they get very talkative okay girls actually want to talk about their feelings they want to talk about what's upsetting them guys tend to go guys tend to go quiet and then girls like why won't you talk to me it's like cuz this is what guys do guys and girls are largely this isn't every guy in every girl these are generalizations but these general Asians Asians exist for a reason and are scientifically backed ok there's a study conducted by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health and Georgia State University and what they found is that girls again like to get together in one-on-one relationships BFFs and boys are more attuned to group dynamics and competition that's not something that girls aren't that interested in engaging in beyond that boys don't like sharing right girls like sharing okay this is according to this according to the APA the American Psychological Association quote research has long shown that boys are less likely to disclose thoughts and feelings with one another than girls are popular psychology had posited that boys reticence to talk about feelings was a fear of being embarrassed or ridicule by peers but new research in impress at child development suggests differently rather than feeling embarrassed it finds boys perceive that sharing is simply a waste of time yes this is correct this is what men think when people want to share feelings were like shut up no one cares okay when girls want to share feelings they think sharing feelings make social bonds stronger girls are right on this and guys are wrong but guys are right that if you spend all your time sharing your feelings nothing gets done okay but this is why you have societal breakdown in Lord of the Flies because it's not a bunch of guys sitting around and talking about how sad it is that some of their friends just drown and how they wish they could get back to civilization and how much they miss their parents it's a bunch of guys going I don't want to talk about that crap let's go kill a pig right that's what Lord of the Flies is so the reason I'm upset about this is once again Hollywood is trying to promote this idea that boys and girls are the same boys and girls are not the same and people who say that boys and girls are the same are super super stupid in every possible way boys and girls are not the same boys can't become girls girls can't become boys there are some boys who tend toward more feminine behavior and some girls who tend toward more masculine behavior but on the whole there are massive differences and just plopping girls into boys roles it doesn't do the trick it's it's so annoying I mean can you imagine like how about an all-male beaches or I mean as long as we're gonna be just substituting sexes how about we just do all-male beaches you know with like that Midler how bad would that movie be right about as bad as an all-female Lord of the Flies do you really want a movie that curtain that has in it Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey and Mayim Bialik and then instead you have like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sly Stallone they're just sitting around talking about their feelings and there's a picture on the piano of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sly Stallone in the poster for the film yeah I didn't think so either God people can we it can we understand that human beings like watching human beings act like the actual human beings that they see in real life they don't want women who act like men it's one that say women can't be action stars right if you watch aliens then you see Ripley right you see the you see Sigourney Weaver picking up the mantle of what could be a male action part but the whole point is because everyone else is dead and there's no one there to save her right she has to fulfill that role this happens in real life too and that's why it that's why it brings true Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 she's also forced into the circumstance like the transition between Linda Hamilton in Terminator 1 and Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 is really fascinating and in Terminator 1 she's very feminine character who's being protected by this guy who has come to protect her unborn child right protect her from being murdered in so she's very feminine character in Terminator 2 there's no one there to protect her and so she has to step up into it herself it's not the same thing as saying that Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 should have been Linda Hamilton in Terminator 1 and told the guy who came back from the future to go screw himself she can protect herself that'd be a dumb movie known and watch that movie because it'd be stupid okay meanwhile on a on a less light note president Trump traveled to Missouri yesterday to talk about taxes I want to
