NBC News national political reporter Cara Lee the president of the Latino partnership for conservative principles Alfonso Aguilar and Washington Post columnist in the deputy editorial page editor Ruth Marcus okay first I'm gonna go quickly in the weeds on North Korea and then sort of pull back on the big sort of the week that was Carol we're seeing I mean there we thought they were trying to walk him back and suddenly he was told to clarify this is I guess second day in a row that Sarah Sanders had sort of gotten ahead of the president I think this is what you get when you have when you move this fast on something like this and you have people in place who aren't necessarily fully familiar with the issues and what each individual word means and so yet now they're walking it back and they're saying get some extra steps so now they're saying no we're still meeting everything's still the same and what they're saying was Aaron Sanders meant by saying there needed to be concrete and verifiable benchmarks or steps or whatever taken that they're going back to what the South Koreans said then Kim jong-un said he would do which is commit to Norton denuclearization not be okay with the joint exercise between the u.s. and South Korea and you know to otherwise accept that there are still be sanctions and not test anything what about Alfonso any of this that is why I sort of find it surprising that Republicans are surprised anymore and I say that because that looks from campaign it's basically saying nobody else has figured out this Korea problem so I'm gonna try different things I think it he's doing it I think they're surprised but many are encouraged and I think on both sides we've seen some positive comments because regardless of the communications issues and I think with this administration was always going to hit them right the reality is that I think it's a validation of Trump's policy towards North Korea of trying to put pressure on North Korea having leverage to see if North Korea changes they changed their mind and the South Korean national security adviser did say that this was happening because of the leadership of Trump and because it was being tough on the North Koreans which tells me the South Koreans want this and I think what we have not we have down played this they are I think pushing but the other thing like to take issue with the validation point but I do think the South Koreans are pushing president Trump agreed if it happens to give North Korea something that North Korea has long sought in exchange for what in exchange after they did conducted a whole bunch of tests that were alarming that they weren't supposed to conduct after they violated previous agreements so I don't understand what policy you're validating other than if you behaved badly then we'll agree to sit down the topic validating that we're still talking about denuclearization the Obama administration I basically didn't give enough you mentioned some rice and rice several months ago wrote an op-ed saying that we should accept on North Korea with nuclear there's a lot of and it's not a four pot so I am actually happy that this administration is willing to do something out of the box to ensure that North Korea stops developing their military nuclear capabilities I want right no it's either way whatever you think about it I think that any everyone agrees that whatever has been done in the past is not working and this is high-risk and high-reward but wherever anyone comes down on this Republicans Democrats diplomats current and former everyone agrees that it hadn't hasn't worked and trying something new while risk is a risk but nothing else has worked does this happen and this is how about this does this happen before the fourth of July I know they say May but what do you guys think this happens before the fourth of July that's a hard to say you know I hope it does and I hope it does change the dynamic but you know I can't okay I'm gonna say because my job is just disagreeing with you all day today I really hope it doesn't and I'm the reason I hope it doesn't is that to prepare adequately for a summit like this takes not weeks but months and it takes a process that actually requires having people in place who can do that process we don't have right now either the process or the people so high risk and to have a successful summit requires the preparation for a summit you are speaking in the days I know where there was a Donald Trump I mean I Carol I how long is it gonna take to prepare Oh so I mean with Obama was eight years nothing happens so I'm thinking you know let's look at some that I'm just let's put on a summit is like sounds like lots of fun but it's not the way effective foreign policy gets conducted Carol I feel like this is the week that Donald Trump got more and more comfortable governing with his gut the same way he managed his company with his gut I think he he's he's a loud staff to rein him in previously but this week he hasn't not on tariffs and not at night it's more there seems to be an AMOLED emboldened spirit in him with his own staff and depending on their response you are likely to get more of that if he likes the way that this is get being received and the media coverage and everything else then you'll see more of that but this is this is if you look at how he campaign this is exactly who I said he would be this is the trump presidency very promising this every single day raw unfiltered Trump and yes and we've seen it on display this week what we don't know yet is whether what the outcome is I do not feel particularly rosy about the outcome on tariffs and not I'm certainly a little anxious about the outcome react a Lindsey Graham statement on this it was it was a interestingly word and he said a word of warning to North Korean president Kim jong-un the worst possible thing you could do is meet with President Trump in person and try to play him if you do that it will be the end of you and your regime what's odd about it is he's assuming that the president could get played by him right way that's written it was weirdly insulting in there subtle jab well but it's a reality I mean Kim of the North Korean regime has played so it's it's a recognition look I think on tariffs I think that Trump was being the only issue where he's been consistent throughout his life is trade and tariffs through the 80s remember criticizing NAFTA criticizing other trade agreements so I think he's being consistent angering many Republicans and I think some Democrats are actually pleased because at most Republicans don't like the idea of imposing 25 percent Paris on on obscenity five percent tariffs on steel by the way the president got a gift today I go move we got a gift today with that jobs report yeah you know they sort of like all everybody getting unnerved by tariffs like now jobs are being created hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
