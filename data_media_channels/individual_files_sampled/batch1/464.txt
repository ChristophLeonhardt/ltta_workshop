young people set fire to cars buildings and fault with riot police while dozens of firefighters battle blazes the second night of violence in Nant was sparked by the killing of a 22 year old man by police on Tuesday Frances Prime Minister condemned the unrest and said an investigation has started the case is in the hands of the justice system and it will do its work thoroughly and with full transparency because everyone wants to know exactly what happened and I will make sure this is the case the man killed was driving in this neighborhood when police stopped his car for a check police said he gave a fake identity then abruptly reversed as if fleeing prompting another officer to open fire the fact that this individual has been the object since June 2017 a fan arrest warrant issued by the credit court for organized robbery with a group of criminals maybe this will explain the logic behind the drivers attempt two people here say tensions often run high between police and young people but the fatal shooting has shocked many for a so called routine traffic stop because it can happen to anyone to be pulled over and asked for his papers in the car it should be simple maybe your search or something but I don't think there's a need for weapons the victim was from a Paris suburb where nearly 200 people have marched in protest against what they call police violence the concern for French authorities now is whether the unrest in Narns will spread to the capital and to other cities Natasha Butler al Jazeera Paris
