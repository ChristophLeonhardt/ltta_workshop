we're um we're pretty Luna but I see who
is no crazy yet this is the profile page
of battle done by on vk.com which is a
popular social network in Russia what's
great about open source information is
anyone you know from their own home can
actually go and see and try to piece
together the actual truth it's really
hard to tell where the photograph was
taken but lucky for us the soldier who
posted it didn't turn off his location
settings so we followed the pin on the
map out into the countryside and we've
already seen three really big army
encampments with hundreds of vehicles in
them you can really feel the military
presence out here the protest area Sen
you see haroche approximation but
otunbayeva
