well we got some wonderful news yesterday as I'm sure you heard Justice Kennedy's retirement is great fantastic news and I'm surprised by it III admit that I'm surprised I really figured that he would wait at least until after the midterms to retire so that he doesn't become the most hated man um you know in Washington at least among the Liberals and the media and so forth but he did retire and you know I said as recent as recently as yesterday I had said that I don't think we're heading into a civil war in this country and the thing that in my mind would prevent a civil war is that Americans are very lazy and also you can't really get air conditioning and Wi-Fi on the battlefield so I figured that would be kind of our saving grace that would prevent an actual war from taking place but then Kennedy retired and now we are looking at the very real though far from certain possibility of roe v wade being overturned and the phantom right to abortion being voided from the books this of course would not be the same as outlawing abortion by the way and i know that this is probably really obvious to most of you but some people seem to be confused on this point this to overturn roe v wade is not to outlaw abortion that would not outlaw abortion to outlaw abortion nationwide would require probably an amendment a personhood amendment or something like that but a SCOTUS decision would be hugely significant it would be one of the greatest moments in American history by far though it wouldn't be the end of the pro-life fight it would really it would it would actually be more like the beginning of the pro-life fight the way that somebody on Twitter said I thought they put her - they put it in a way that's very apt I think and he said that the overturning of roe v wade would be like d-day okay so it's not the end of World War two it is d-day it is like storming the beaches okay here's when the real fight starts and it's important for us to understand this this is not me trying to downplay the significance of overturning roe v wade I mean I would I would literally weep for joy if that happened I would weep for joy for days if that happened but what would then happen is that all the states would have the ability to outlaw it if they if they chose to and so immediately upon this decision coming down if it were to come down abortion would still be legal in every state in the Union and then each state would have to go through and explicitly outlaw it themselves and we know that there's a good chunk of states where that's just not gonna happen staves like you know California New York it's not gonna happening but then there are other states where it could happen and that's where there's gonna be a real fight okay that's where there's gonna be a battle like you've never seen before and that's where the culture war I think could bubble over into something like a real war and it's just a wee tweak you cannot understate or you cannot overstate the way liberals will react if their right to abortion is actually threatened and this is not me at all saying oh well you know maybe we shouldn't do it because I'm afraid of how liberal know this is they will explode perhaps literally in some way and if that's the case so be it because there is no price there is no price that is too high to pay when it comes to finally doing away with this historic atrocity and so of overturning roe v wade and beginning to actually outlaw abortion if that did bubble over into violent hostility because the left just cannot handle it then I say so be it so be it this is what we have to understand it's something I've been saying for a long time I wrote a whole book on the subject in fact abortion is the left's highest sacrament that's what I call it it's it's their high saccharine sacrament it's the most important thing to them it's it's it's the thing that is most central to their ideology into their outlook on life the modern left was really born with Roe and it won't die with the overturning of Roe but it will enter into a new phase a phase that is even darker more depraved more wicked and probably more violent than the phase that they're currently in and there's a reason why abortion is so important to the left we mean it we need to understand the reason it's a very simple reason modern leftism is the worship of the self is the worship of the south and in that sense it is not you know some people will say well modern leftism is not the same as classical liberalism the two completely different things and they are two different things but they're not two completely different things with classical liberalism and the Enlightenment the seeds were planted for what we now call modern leftism the seeds were planted and they sprouted into this disgusting hideous thing called leftism and now what defines the left is its belief in the supremacy of the self the self is supreme I get to decide not me personally but I as in the self I get to decide what is right what is wrong what is true what is false everything is relative to my desires my feelings my needs my proclivities my lifestyle I can even change my own biological makeup if I want to I can I can change my very identity just on the strength of my desire that's what modern left is belief the south is the highest life form the highest good and that is why liberalism is I have said that liberalism is Satan's liberalism is kind of a secular Satanist and I don't say that is an insult I mean I don't say it as a compliment either but it's it's not don't mean it just as an insult it's just it's just true lit at this point you can't it's hard to distinguish liberalism from Satanism and if you were to go to a satanic temple which I don't recommend but if you were to go to a satanic temple and you hear what's being said it would sound an awful lot like what you would hear at a DNC convention Satanists themselves will tell you I've gotten into some Twitter spats with the The Satanic temple or whatever the official satanic religion is and they're very you know they want to make it very clear from a PR perspective they're very they're very eager to inform you that they don't worship Satan they don't believe in sane rather they worship what Satan himself worshiped which is the south Satan worshipped himself the self and so that's what the modern Satanists worship as well not Satan not him say but the south which means that they are also worshipping Satan they just don't know it they worship the the mighty me you know me I the the I in the self Aleister Crowley the famous Satanist an occultist said the way he put it was do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law so in other words just the hope do what you want you know that's the that's the only that's the only moral law is just do what you want and if anything could be considered arguably immoral it would be to refrain from doing what you want that's a that's you know that that is the only the only perversion is to exercise self-restraint and this is also how liberals fields it's the same idea now here's the other point in this world where there is no god but the individual then the whole point really of life is pleasure there's if there if there is no God and there is no objective morality there's no objective truth then the only point of life is just to have fun and to accumulate possessions and experience and wealth but mainly to enjoy yourself and to and to have pleasure well if pleasure is the point of life then the most pleasurable thing sex is now the centerpiece of existence it is the point of the point and therefore the worst thing that anyone could possibly do is impose limitations on your sex life because your sex life is your life you don't you don't draw a distinction between your life and your sex life it's the same thing and for someone to intrude on your sex life in your mind interfere with it impose restraints or confines or anything well then they're doing that to you as a person they're doing it to your entire life and the greatest the greatest limitation but in the minds of a leftist the worst limitation is the one that comes naturally with sex itself and that is the formation of new life so the point of life is pleasure greatest pleasure is sex worst thing you could do therefore is limit sex and the worst limitation on sex is the fact that it naturally creates people and so now the creation of people is treated like you know like a disease like like it's not the natural outcome of sex but but more some kind of some kind of mutation and then the pill you know the birth control pill becomes like this miracle a new kind of miracle really because the old miracles were all about restoring life healing life but this one prevents life that's the new the new miracle prevents life from happening and we say oh that's America but abortion abortion is the ultimate birth control and also at the same time the ultimate expression of the supremacy of the individual of the self the ultimate expression of a woman's liberation liberation from motherhood liberation from morality liberation from from responsibility liberation from her child and her child of course represents all of those things her child represents responsibility morality motherhood of course so so so her child is the embodiment of that which makes her child her enemy and in destroying it she kind of exercises her dominance and her power abortion fortifies sex as a purely pleasure-seeking endeavor and at the same time it codifies into law the relativism and self worship of modern leftist it is the foundation of the left's entire movement and with abortion the left has seized finally it's god-like that godlike power it is always craved the godlike power over life and death the power to assert the the the desires of the individual over the needs and the very life of the other so they cannot let it go they cannot they want this is everything if they let that go they give up everything and they will fight with a ruthlessness that you have never seen before they will lie they will cheat they will destroy they will kill I mean they've been killing all along they've killed 60 million babies so they don't have any moral qualms about if anything could spark if anything could spark a new civil war in this country then I think this would be it but more likely is the situation I talked about yesterday where when we think of Civil War we think of our mind goes to the sit-in the civil war of 1861 when you 'no forms well the South didn't always have uniforms but or shoes but you have the two sides marching forth towards each other in formation and then they're shooting muskets at each other and cannonballs I don't think we're gonna be especially the muskets and cannibals I don't think we're looking at a civil war like that could be something more more akin to what I talked about yesterday which is just kind of chaos and anarchy in the streets like what we've already seen in Baltimore and Ferguson and other places except that across the nation and involving perhaps this time guns and and and lasting for a lot a lot longer I mean I don't know I that that's what I worry might could happen and I think that you could argue we've been on that trajectory for a while now I talked about yesterday the powder kegs right we're sitting on certain powder kegs well maybe this is the biggest powder keg of all and if that goes off who knows what happens I say all of this just as means of just in the interests of us preparing ourselves and looking honestly at the situation where it's not going to be as simple as overturn roe v wade abortion is gone array now there will be a ready if they overturn roe v wade believe me but then there's going to be a real fight and as I said at the top so be it I will fight that fight that is a fight worth fighting 100% no hesitation but we have to get to that point first and you know and and and the other the other wrinkle here last thing I'll say the other wrinkle is here this is going to require Republicans there's going to be pressure on Republicans like they've never seen and so the Republicans are going to have to vote to confirm a justice who could overturn roe v wade and that's gonna require real actual backbone encouraged from Republicans as I can't even save backbone courage and Republican in the same sentence without laughing so that's what it's gonna require for the first time in decades it's gonna require actual courage in a Republican Party this time to approve a Justice who could overturn roe v wade and and to do it right before a midterm election and I hope they have that kind of courage I would not at all take it for granted that they all do liberals would only need a couple of of cowardly Republicans to defect and there are more than a couple cowardly Republicans it's more like there are a couple courageous ones in the wrestler count so so this is not at all you know this is this is not all something we take for granted and this means that we as conservatives and pro-lifers we have to be putting the pressure on the Republicans like you better do the right thing the message from liberals is going to be well if you if you vote to confirm a you know a conservative justice we're gonna see to it that you're voted out of office well our message to Republicans need to be if you dare now our message needs to be if you dare defect on this if you dare drop this ball you are finished your political career is over you will never we will never vote for you for any office ever again you're done it is Unforgiven see unforgivable sin there is nothing you could do after that point to redeem yourself you're finished and so that's our message that's our message has to be the Republicans you do the right thing here or you we are exiling you into the wilderness and that is it there's no coming back from it so batten down the hatches folks things could get ugly but we're fighting for life we're on the right side we are we are definitively clearly on the right side and so whatever has to happen to fight for what's right well that's just gonna be it's just gonna be what it is thanks for watching everybody I think I just broke my globe let's see if I can repair it have a good day you
