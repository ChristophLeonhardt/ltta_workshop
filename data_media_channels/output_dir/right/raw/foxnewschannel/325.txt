1
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:06,508
>> Neil: ALREADY ON THE

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:07,376
COURT BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN

3
00:00:07,377 --> 00:00:08,010
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH ISN’T

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,244
IN THE EYES OF SOME

5
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:09,945
DEMOCRATS GOING TO STAY ON

6
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:10,346
THE COURT.

7
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,081
A NUMBER OF LEADING EFFORTS

8
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:12,915
ESPECIALLY IF THEY GAIN THE

9
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,049
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE TO

10
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,850
BEGIN IMPEACHMENT

11
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:16,652
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST HIM.

12
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:18,320
GRAY THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE

13
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,122
COUNSEL FOR RONALD REAGAN

14
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,490
AND GEORGE HERBERT WALKER

15
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:22,892
BUSH EXPERT IN ALL THESE

16
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:23,225
MATTERS.

17
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:24,593
I DON’T SEE WHERE THAT WOULD

18
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:24,994
GO.

19
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:25,728
BUT WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY

20
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:26,295
WOULD GO.

21
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:27,496
>> I DON’T SEE WHERE IT

22
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:28,731
WOULD GO EITHER.

23
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:34,036
YOU CAN IMPEACH AND

24
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:34,437
INDICTMENT.

25
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:35,471
TRIAL IN THE SENATE.

26
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:37,073
TAKES TWO THIRDS TO CONVICT.

27
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,007
IT’S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

28
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,308
SEE HOW YOU COULD GET TWO

29
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,711
THIRDS OF THE VOTE NOW AND

30
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:44,380
ESPECIALLY IF THE VOTERS CAN

31
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:46,382
PICK UP A SEAT OR TWO WHICH

32
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:48,051
IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

33
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:49,852
I DON’T SEE WHERE IT GOES

34
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:52,222
EXCEPT MORE EMBARRASSMENT,

35
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:54,324
MORE, YOU KNOW, HARM TO THE

36
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:54,624
COURT.

37
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,227
AND IF THE INTENTION IS THE

38
00:00:57,228 --> 00:00:58,661
MEDIA AGAINST THE LEGITIMACY

39
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,263
OF THE SUPREME COURT, THAT

40
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,399
IS REALLY DANGEROUS IN MY

41
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,799
VIEW.

42
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,201
>> Neil: NOW, YOU DEALT WITH

43
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:06,202
THIS, WHETHER CLARENCE

44
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:07,837
THOMAS IN THE CAPACITY AS

45
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:09,606
BEING AN ADVISOR TO HIM.

46
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:11,207
AND HE ALWAYS HAD LIKE A

47
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,142
TARGET ON HIM.

48
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:14,244
AND I’M WONDERING DID THAT

49
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:15,512
EVER DISSIPATE AFTER THOSE

50
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:16,346
CONTROVERSIAL HEARINGS HE

51
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:18,982
WAS APPROVED 52-48 IN THE

52
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:19,916
DEMOCRATIC SENATE WE MIGHT

53
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:20,650
POINT OUT.

54
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:22,552
IT WAS TOOTH AND NAIL THE

55
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:24,021
WHOLE BATTLE PROMISES LIKE

56
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:25,489
IN THIS CASE TO MAKE HIM A

57
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,889
MARKED MAN.

58
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,257
>> I DON’T THINK IT WORKS.

59
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:29,059
AND REMEMBER HE GOT 11

60
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,295
DEMOCRATIC VOTES.

61
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:31,962
>> Neil: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

62
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:32,262
RIGHT.

63
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:33,363
>> THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN

64
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:33,664
THING.

65
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,032
I THINK HE SUFFERED

66
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:36,767
SOMETHING OF A CLOUD FOR A

67
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,367
FEW YEARS.

68
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:39,002
IS HE NOW ONE OF THE MOST

69
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:39,703
RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE

70
00:01:39,704 --> 00:01:40,004
COURT.

71
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,507
HE IS KNOWN BY DEMOCRATIC

72
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:44,475
SCHOLARS AS WELL AS

73
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:46,043
REPUBLICAN OR CONSERVATIVE

74
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,811
IF YOU WILL AS BEING ONE OF

75
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,146
THE LEADERS OF THE COURT.

76
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:51,348
HE GOT TO MEN OFTEN WHEN

77
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,616
THEY CAN’T REMEMBER WHAT

78
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,451
THEY DECIDED 15 YEARS

79
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,419
EARLIER IN A PARTICULAR

80
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,719
CASE.

81
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,188
IS HE ADORED BY HIS

82
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:57,588
COLLEAGUES.

83
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,689
AND HE IS ONE OF THE MOST

84
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,990
FUN PEOPLE TO BE WITH AND IS

85
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:01,459
HE VERY, VERY FUN EVEN

86
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,795
THOUGH HE DOESN’T TALK.

87
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:05,396
>> Neil: THAT’S RIGHT.

88
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:06,464
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

89
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:07,398
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE

90
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,400
HEARD ABOUT TRYING TO PURSUE

91
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,801
IMPEACHMENT IS THAT THE

92
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,137
JUDGE KAVANAUGH PERJURED

93
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:13,471
HIMSELF.

94
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,106
I’M NOT AN ALAWYER OR EXPERT

95
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:16,407
ON THESE THINGS, YOU ARE.

96
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:18,943
I STARTED TO DIGGING INTO

97
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:22,680
THIS HOW PURGER HIMSELF.

98
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,614
MINIMIZE HOW OFTEN HE GOT

99
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:24,582
DRUNK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

100
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,150
I’M THINKING TO MYSELF BOY,

101
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,452
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

102
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:28,286
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT.

103
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:30,255
>> MY GOSH, I THANK GOD I’M

104
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:31,189
NEVER GOING TO BE QUESTIONED

105
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,090
ABOUT MY DRINKING IN HIGH

106
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:34,159
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.

107
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,893
>> Neil: DON’T GO THERE WE

108
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:36,561
DON’T WANT TO OPEN A CAN OF

109
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:36,895
WORMS.

110
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,596
THAT’S REALLY WHAT IT COMES

111
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:38,897
DOWN.

112
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:39,998
TO SAY THAT’S WHERE HE WAS

113
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,666
NOT VERY HONEST OR

114
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,333
FORTHCOMING ABOUT SOMETHING

115
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:44,169
HE WAS DOING IN HIGH SCHOOL.

116
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,404
>> WELL, I GOT THE

117
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:47,105
IMPRESSION, LISTENING TO THE

118
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:50,141
HEARINGS WITHOUT THE

119
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:52,010
COMMENTARY THAT HE LIKED

120
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,178
BEER AND HE DRANK A LOT.

121
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,547
I NEVER HAD ANY DIFFERENT

122
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:55,847
VIEW.

123
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,482
HE LIKED TO DRINK.

124
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,383
AND THAT HAPPENINGS TO

125
00:02:58,384 --> 00:02:59,217
PEOPLE IN COLLEGE.

126
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:00,986
IT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE IN HIGH

127
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:01,687
SCHOOL.

128
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:03,288
AND, YOU KNOW, MOST OF US

129
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,823
GROW OUT OF IT BUT I CAN’T

130
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,725
SAY THAT I WOULD BE IN THE

131
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:08,226
SAME PICKLE IS HE IN IF I

132
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:10,195
WERE IN HIS SHOES.

133
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,363
BECAUSE I CAN’T MAKE A

134
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:12,264
RELATIVE JUDGMENT ABOUT MY

135
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,765
OWN DRINKING WHEN I WAS IN

136
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,300
COLLEGE ANDY SOME THINGS

137
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:16,768
THAT I REGRET TODAY.

138
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,203
AND WOULDN’T DO AGAIN.

139
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:19,638
AND HAVE DONE EVERYTHING TO

140
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,607
MAKE SURE THAT MY ONE

141
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,841
DAUGHTER DOESN’T DO, HASN’T

142
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,443
DONE.

143
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:26,078
>> Neil: YOU KNOW, I SEE A

144
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,213
METHOD TO THIS.

145
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,649
AGAIN, NO LEGAL EXPERTISE,

146
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,352
THAT’S WHY I’M HAPPY TO HAVE

147
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:37,356
YOU HERE CREATE DOUBTS HIS

148
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:38,157
AUTHENTICITY UNDER OATH THAT

149
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,595
HE MIGHT HAVE MISSTATE OR

150
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:46,799
BLACKED OUT AFTER FALLEN

151
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
ASLEEP THEREBY MAKING

152
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,801
POSSIBLE THE CLAIMS OF

153
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:49,168
DR. FORD.

154
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,102
I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GETTING

155
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:50,570
AT HERE.

156
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:52,071
IT DOES SEEM A STRETCH AND

157
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:53,139
MAYBE A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT

158
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,075
TO USE THAT AS PRECEDENT IN

159
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:56,976
FUTURE, YOU KNOW, SUPREME

160
00:03:56,977 --> 00:04:00,179
COURT PICKS AND WILL GO THAT

161
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,547
FAR BACK AND ASK THOSE TYPE

162
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:02,181
OF QUESTIONS.

163
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:05,184
>> I THINK THAT’S A VERY

164
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:06,119
DANGEROUS ROUTE TO TAKE.

165
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,354
IF THEY DO THAT THEY OPEN

166
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:09,722
UP -- THEY TAKE A RISK THAT

167
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:11,324
I WOULDN’T TAKE IF I WERE

168
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:11,624
THEY.

169
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:17,397
THEY OPEN UP DE BLASIO

170
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:18,698
HERSELF TO THE SAME KIND OF

171
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,065
SCRUTINY.

172
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,332
I’M NOT SURE SHE COMES OUT

173
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,102
WELL IF SHE IS PUT UNDER THE

174
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:22,902
SPOTLIGHT THE WAY THEY MIGHT

175
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:24,170
DO TO HIM.

176
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,505
SO, WHAT IS NEEDED BY THE

177
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:27,440
COUNTRY IS SOME SORT OF, YOU

178
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,442
KNOW, ALL RIGHT.

179
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,011
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS, YOU

180
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:31,411
WON.

181
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:32,946
LET BY GONES BE BY GONES.

182
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:34,814
WE WILL SEE YOU IN COURT ON

183
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,284
ANOTHER DAY AND LET’S ACCEPT

184
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:40,387
THIS OUTCOME AND, YOU KNOW,

185
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,522
GET TOGETHER BECAUSE THE

186
00:04:42,523 --> 00:00:00,000
COURT IS ONE OF THE PRIZED
