the captain's eye view of our voyage south as the icebreaker Arctic sunrise pushes through into the remote waters of the Weddell Sea a vast unknown territory few ships venture this far our team has already made an attempt this Antarctic summer but was foiled by ice caps is trying to weave away through all these ice blades to get as far down into the Weddell Sea as possible try and reach a 64 parallel that we're giving is what would be the protected finally we break through into the isolated area of the proposed site tree at the moment I checked on the M the satellite charts this morning and there's uh someone other ship in this entire space as us there and another ship about there and that's it in that whole whole area exciting kind of just makes a case that this is pristine this area is not developed it's not got industry it's never had industry we take our chance in this rare window of weather to take to the air and look down on the mesmerizing scene below the western edge of the would be protected zone breathtaking the raw power of land and sea and ice constantly reshaping on the move this is nature on a planetary scale so what we're looking at here is multi-year sea ice and great icebergs that have been carved off the glasses sweeping off James Ross Island and the Weddell Sea extends way into the distance over there the proposed area pretty much untouched by human activity almost no scientific research is taking place back to base the Arctic sunrise standing by for our return alongside her a giant tabular iceberg perhaps a kilometer long the next helicopter sortie is to the very top of it the expedition team are making a dramatic landing to spread the sanctuary message around the world this iceberg thousands of years in the making now adrift in a process that has been going on for hundreds of thousands of years a process it seems may be changing because of global warming and in a day of scenic wonder below the Antarctic day ends with a spectacular show above this apparently a reverse sunset phenomenon while simultaneously the clouds morph and shape and color into a fantastic unworldly painting across the evening sky at the ends of the earth Nick lark al Jazeera Antarctica
