1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,669
AND ALWAYS WORKING TO BE BETTER.

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,044
ROB: ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK,

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,545
ONE WEEK OUT FROM PRESIDENT

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,214
TRUMP'S POTENTIALLY HISTORIC

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,348
SIT-DOWN WITH KIM JONG UN.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,417
NOW SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,419
AL-ASSAD WANTS HIS OWN FACE TO

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,087
FACE WITH KIM JONG UN.

9
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,789
QUOTE, I'M GOING TO VISIT THE

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,091
DPRK AND MEET KIM JONG UN.

11
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,526
JILLIAN: DESPITE CLAIMS NO

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,128
INDICATIONS THAT ANY PLANS HAVE

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:28,995
BEEN MADE.

14
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,597
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT NORTH

15
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,265
KOREA IS COURTING OTHER HEADS OF

16
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,967
STATES WHILE PLANNING A SUMMIT

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,601
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

18
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:38,038
HERE NOW TO WEIGH IN IS THE

19
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,743
AUTHOR OF DEAR, WHAT DO YOU

20
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,012
THINK OF THE LATEST NEWS.

21
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:50,417
>> ON THE ONE HAND THIS COULD BE

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,384
PLATITUDE AND THE OTHER THING

23
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,587
WHY IS DOES THE U.S. GET TO BE

24
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,722
ARM'S DEALER AND THEY DON'T.

25
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,558
ALL THE MISSILE TESTS ARE GREAT

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,560
COMMERCIAL FOR PRODUCTS AND

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,062
SMALL STATE CAN STAND UP TO U.S.

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,063
AND OTHER NATIONS, THIS IS

29
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,066
SOMETHING THAT WILL COMPENSATE

30
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:06,466
FOR.

31
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,468
THEY WILL DIAL DOWN MISSILES AN

32
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,569
WEAPON'S INDUSTRIES, THEY WILL

33
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,970
WANT MONEY OR SOMETHING ELSE IN

34
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,508
EXCHANGE AND SYRIA WOULD BE ONE

35
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,010
OF THE CUSTOMERS.

36
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,611
ROB: TWO VERY BAD PEOPLE MEETING

37
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,379
TOGETHER.

38
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,481
BIG-TIME THREAT TO, I THINK,

39
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,749
INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE TWO

40
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,084
MEETING AND BIG THREAT, I THINK,

41
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,618
TO OUR NEGOTIATIONS HERE.

42
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,720
ARE WE FOOLS TO GO INTO THIS

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,054
MEETING AT THIS POINT KNOWING

44
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:32,358
THAT THEY WILL MEET, THIS DOES

45
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,793
SEEM LIKE BAD NEWS.

46
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:34,627
>> WE CAN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING

47
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,130
THAT THE NORTH KOREAN PROPAGANDA

48
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,432
SAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE QUOTING

49
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,633
ASSAD SAYING THEY WILL VISIT

50
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,135
WITH KIM JONG UN IN THE FUTURE

51
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,104
DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS GOTTEN

52
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,206
FLIGHT YET, THERE'S ONLY ONE TO

53
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:54,047
FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG, IT'S BEEN

54
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,515
ONE.

55
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,650
JILLIAN: YOU STILL THINK WE

56
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,185
SHOULD HAVE SUMMIT, DOES IT

57
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,520
PERHAPS CHANGE THE APPROACH?

58
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,321
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

59
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,856
VERY WELL AWARE AND ALL THE

60
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,090
PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE ARE

61
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,926
AWARE OF THE NATURE OF NORTH

62
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,260
KOREANS.

63
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,930
THIS IS NOT MEETING WITH THERESA

64
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,666
MAY OR ANGELA MERKEL, HAVE NO

65
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,668
PROBLEM KEEPING FOOD AWAY FROM

66
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,537
PEOPLE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN

67
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:21,508
POWER IN COST.

68
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,509
ROB: VLADIMIR PUTIN AND

69
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,677
PRESIDENT TRUMP POTENTIALLY

70
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,713
MEETING TOGETHER, WHAT DO YOU

71
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,082
MAKE OF THAT?

72
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,551
>> PROBABLY THE RUSSIAN

73
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,986
MENTALITY IF YOUR RIVALS ARE

74
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,821
DOING WELL, YOU WILL DO ANYTHING

75
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:40,593
THAT YOU CAN.

76
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,861
RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER MET

77
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,163
WITH KIM JONG UN EARLIER THIS

78
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:43,463
WEEK.

79
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,532
NO DOUBT THEY DISCUSSED UPCOMING

80
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,333
SUMMIT AND ISSUES WITH AMERICA.

81
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,369
I CAN SEE PUTIN COZING UP TO KIM

82
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,471
JONG UN AS HE HAS DONE TO OTHER

83
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,273
PLACES IN THE WORLD SIMPLY AS

84
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,307
METH TO UNDERMINING PRESIDENT

85
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,177
TRUMP AS HE TRIED TO UNDERMINE

86
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,145
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

87
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,647
JILLIAN: HE SPOKE ABOUT THIS AND

88
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,915
WE WILL HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO

89
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,483
SAY ON THE OTHER SIDE.

90
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,084
>> AS IT RELATES TO ANY

91
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,953
POTENTIAL MEETING IT WOULD BE A

92
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,021
WAYS OFF BUT I THINK THE

93
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,556
PRESIDENT HAS STATED BEFORE THAT

94
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,191
HE WOULD LIKE TO GET TOGETHER

95
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,926
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN AT SOME

96
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,061
POINT AND SOLVE SOME OF THE

97
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,963
ISSUES BETWEEN THEM AND THE

98
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,231
PRESIDENT IS SHREWD ENOUGH WHERE

99
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:23,469
HE WOULD NOT SIT DOWN WITH

100
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,637
PRESIDENT PUTIN UNLESS HE HAD

101
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,806
ISSUES THAT SERVED THE NATION.

102
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,675
>> I THINK HE HAS GREAT INSIDE,

103
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,210
AMBASSADOR OF CHINA FOR QUITE A

104
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,910
WHILE.

105
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,946
HE HAS MIND SET OF RUSSIAN AN

106
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,182
CHINESE AND HE WAS NO TRUMP FAN.

107
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:40,286
IF HE'S BEHIND THE PRESIDENT,

108
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,656
IT'S FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

109
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,125
ROB: IS IT THAT YOU CAN HAVE

110
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:51,397
NORTH KOREA, SYRIA ALLIANCE AND

111
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,367
CHINA BEHIND THEM AND THIS COULD

112
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:58,238
END UP IN WORLD WAR?

113
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,672
>> WHAT DO WE HAVE THE TO DO

114
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,341
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, NORTH

115
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,544
KOREA HAS NOT BEEN GOOD AT

116
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,013
MAKING ALLIANCES AND, IN FACT,

117
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:13,119
KIM JONG UN'S ATTEMPTS TO COURT

118
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,654
OTHER COUNTRIES IS A BREAK FROM

119
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,922
THE PAST.

120
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,690
JILLIAN: WHAT'S YOUR CONCERN?

121
00:04:18,690 --> 00:00:00,000
>> NORTH KOREAN POPULATION WILL
