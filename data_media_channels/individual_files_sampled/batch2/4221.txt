this is a former Walmart that has been turned into a center for children let's see if we can get into this building I've matched leave the property but I'm guessing that's about what's to happen yes everything that's what they're going forward what was your name again sir I'm sorry senator jeff merkley jeff u.s. senator jeff yes US policy is involved right now with children this is not something that we specifically deal with but it was just just like an ideas and advice well I've now been asked to leave the property and so I'll comply with that Wow what is the federal government so keen to hide but they will not even let a United States Senator a member of the Congress take a look Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley was blocked from entering this facility in Brownsville Texas where child migrants are being held some of the children are likely victims of the Trump administration policy of separating immigrant kids from their parents when asked to defend his policy of tearing families apart Trump defaults to what really could only be described as a complete and total lie this is a Democrat bill the Democrats can end that very quickly all they have to do is sit down with us and negotiate a real bill that allows us to keep criminals out of this country okay back with me are Maria in Xhosa and the roots Jason Johnson Maria first of all it there's no bill Donald that's a scholar fee it was announced by his own his own Department of Justice had his own attorney general it's a policy of even separating children from people seeking asylum let me play you one more soundbite of Jeff Merkley of the senator he was on all in on Monday describing a processing center that he attempted to visit in McAllen Texas the first room had a series of cages that look a lot like dog kennel in which people had recently arrived and been put into them they were very crowded the individuals had space blankets so you had all these silver space blankets no mattresses and very people looking very distressed and upset a number of women holding children in their arms and then adjacent to that is a very very large warehouse with much larger cages and those the children have already been separated away from the parent the UN Commissioner on human rights has already reviewed us rebuked the United States the United States of America for that policy kennels cages dog kennels for human beings you know there's a there are terms that journalists should know that the entire country needs to know but that people who have been through this talk about by the way again this is this part is new of the separating but a lot of the this whole machinery is not right right two words the first one is yell era which means the icebox this is where people are subjected to being placed so they've just come from the the very hot desert yeah they're in a sweating cold you know a wet t-shirt for example and they're put into what is known everybody every immigrant every person who's delivering your pizza you ask them we got do you know like your later on they're gonna go yes and this is where they put them in it's like 50 60 degrees so you're freezing so how do you show that you've been tortured right the other word is Panera in Spanish Panera is a dog cage our children effectively as the senator said are being put into dog cages and what happens what like the human cost of this is that as we're talking about suicide I want to call out and say the name of marco antonio muñoz who when his three-year-old was ripped away from him he committed suicide yeah and we have to talk about the trauma that is being passed down but this is something that is happening in our country today joy and again where where is you know where are the bodies protesting in front of the the buses that are delivering where are the bodies and i'm saying this not as an activist but as a journalist kind of looking at american history there is that question yeah and there's the story now we are putting up i'm jason i'm gonna come to you on this a family separated the border this distraught father took his own life as a Washington Post article a little clip from it soon after muñoz and his family were taken into custody they arrived at a processing plant in nearby McAllen this is where jeff merkley went and said they wanted to apply for asylum Border Patrol agents told the family they would be separated that's when Munoz lost it according to one agent speaking on condition of anonymity discuss the ins and anybody who reads the story who can read it without choking up I defy you to do it it is horrifying the dad ended up killing himself you know that policy was not worthy of even a single question during the press pool at the g7 yesterday Jason and it strikes me that it is something barbaric that is being done in our name as Americans and we're only hearing about it in little dribs and drabs well yeah this is absolutely disgusting and the public needs to understand there are different reasons that people are coming to this country you have some people who are coming here and there they're breaking a law they're undocumented you have some people who came here legally lost their documents or have them stolen you have some people coming here seeking asylum and sometimes there is individuals sometimes there is family sometimes there's minors they're supposed to be treated differently but under no circumstances should that treatment includes throwing human beings in cages throwing human beings in cages this would be wrong to do to POWs this will be wrong to do to terrorists and it's being done to three-year-olds and four-year-olds and five-year-olds and the fact that a senator from the United States can't get access to something that's being paid for with our tax notices Jonestown members of Congress can't find out what's actually going on this is an abomination that everyone should be ashamed of and here's a real problem here it's not just because it's gonna make folks feel bad it's not just because we have white nationalists running the country it's because this goes back to what we were talking about the g7 eight erodes our global reputation if we cannot treat the weakest of these with a modicum of human decency how do we expect anyone else on this planet to respect our policies yeah you know throughout the Cold War my dear you know the then Soviet Union used America's treatment of African Americans as a propaganda tool against the United States when we would try to argue that we're the good guy in the bad guy they'd say well you know what you know look how you're treating you know they use it as a propaganda tool so this can only be hopeful one would think to those who want to propagandize against the United States you have the United States energy of the Democratic Party Democrats sending a letter to the Trump administration ask him to please stop separating children from their moms and dads and probably gonna get a no from Mitch McConnell to get that on the floor again we have to do brought up history we need to remember right they were separating our first peoples our Native Americans absolutely because they called us savages they separated African children because they called this property they separated Japanese American citizens yep because they said we were infiltrators and distrust were the ants we are now we are now animals and therefore we can be separated we are now animals and look this is really I've been thinking look how do we get in because journalists right this is a journalist plea because we can't get in I am barred from several detention camps because they're privately run so they're making a profit off of everybody that's being held there I can't get in as a journalist they won't let me in so I'm like how do we get in they won't let the senator in how do we get in and I was and I know people are gonna get really upset about this but I was like who could get in who needs to go well obviously Melania that's not gonna happen that would make it worse probably Donald Trump make it worse besides you would glory in seeing animals in cages then it actually has to be President Obama and Michelle Obama and Janet Napolitano and secretary and and Senator Lindsey Graham they should form a National Domestic Commission and then if need be an international commission that gives them access because who else can get in there they're not gonna let us in as journalists so that's not a plea because I'm Mexican or because I it's a journalist plea and don't try to make this into a racial issue because as you know joy there are black children who are being held in those cages yeah they are afro-latino yeah they are Honduran they are Garifuna they are Jamaican they are African yeah so all races of children are being held in those cages this is not a race issue this is an international human rights crisis and as in journalists we can't even be able to tell those stories because we can't see it because you can't get in this happened with general by the way of the difficulty exactly able to see living down our name Jason Johnson to be back on thank Maria and a host about before we go I want to play just so we just do not get this twisted this is Donald Trump's attorney general Jeff Sessions again this is their policy so before you hear again the president try to pretend that this is some sort of democratic policies carrying out here is Jeff Sessions justifying a separating parents from their kids take a listen it's a absolutely necessary general to separate parents from children when they are detained or apprehended at the border yes what's happening is we're having more people coming bringing children with them entering in between the ports of entry between the ports of entry illegally and they're not you cannot give them immunity that's an offense we believe every person that enters the country illegally like that should be prosecuted and you can be given immunity to people who are bring children with them recklessly and improperly and illegally they should never do that hey thanks for checking out
