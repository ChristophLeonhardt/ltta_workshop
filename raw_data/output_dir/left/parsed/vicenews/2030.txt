Tokio police only recently began raiding
JK businesses that were fronts for
prostitution but many say the rates are
largely for show and walking around the
Akihabara neighborhood it seems like the
news story should be about how many JK
businesses are still open for business
we stopped by one a tiny storefront on a
busy street with suggestive pictures
posted in the window nothing remarkable
in a neighborhood full of places like
this but we wanted to see what an
average JK business looked like on the
inside
uh-huh shoes off slippers on I'm not
they've got Hello kitties on them
thank you hi thank you
apparently I can chat for half an hour
for three thousand yen which is like $30
and we can also do fortune telling
yeah in one thing that II ones thank you
Hey thumbs up
it's very kind okay so what's next on
the menu but but then I got in this give
up then I go and I eat at home Oh cuz
it's that app it'll just sort of this oh
 I'd better look it off choice Oh
God so good at that
so konyaku da either hey yo ah good mo
kokoro yeah ah okay that's true oh
god
Cucaracha see this is a really
uncomfortable experience what other sort
of things besides the fortune-telling
is on the menu oh it's better
what sort of questions do your other
clients usually ask you and I got sick -
mmm mandible Alice get him up
while we were talking there was another
rent today going on across the room with
a hidden camera we were able to listen
in but the conversation was pretty
mundane but it's hard to overlook the
very creepy fact that an adult man has
paid for the company of an attractive
schoolgirl
