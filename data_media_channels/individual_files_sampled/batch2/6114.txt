Alexandria Castillo Cortez has just learned something shocking and I mean it's not really shocking when you know her as a candidate and and what her values are but she has just learned and tweeted the following shockingly I'm told this is not a joke we have also won a primary in the neighboring 15th congressional district via write-in campaign on the reform line while I'm honored that so many bronc sites are excited about our campaign I will remain the Democratic nominee for New York 14 so let me break this down so she is just Democrat that ran against the fourth most powerful Democrat in a country Joe Crowley the media thought she that he was invincible we obviously thought otherwise we we covered her in about three dozen videos before the election she pulls off that stunning upset now everybody knows about her and she's all over the press and here's this really progressive candidate and uncorrupted doesn't think any corporate pac money so now she's super popular and and she's 14th district in the 15 district they have a primary and the Reform Party has no candidate and they encourage their followers to write in people so they're like well who do I know was from also from the Bronx and and look do you know exactly which District urine especially if you live in a big state in a big city there's a ton of districts that she's also from the Bronx okay I like Alexandra Acosta Cortez am i right her it and they're like congratulations you've won you're the Reform Party candidate in the 15th district in New York you can't run which is a good thing for two different seats at the same time so she had to turn down her victory in the 15th district it wouldn't have meant that she won the whole election it just meant meant that she won the primary for the Reform Party in the 15th district exactly I the reason why I say this is good news I mean it's obvious she is a true progressive and not only did she defeat an establishment Democrat for that primary but you know she's appealing to a lot of people and that proves again that the mainstream media was completely wrong about her that she was underestimated and that her ideology actually does resonate with people now you know again this is New York so some might argue well it's New York it's liberal but if you look at polling on the issues and you don't tie it to a specific political party Americans are overwhelmingly supportive of the government programs that someone like Acacio Cortes is is trying to defend and and protect and so I love that I love to know that it's like the little silver lining to an otherwise terrible political climate well a couple of things first of all I want to thank our audience because you guys help to get her elected and now look at the giant difference that it made it which leads to the most important point here our idea together and we're not just the Young Turks here you're the Young Turks too if you if you follow us you subscribe to us who etcetera was that if people hear progressive ideas they will love progressive ideas the problem is that without the corporate money it is hard to get the progressive ideas out now you can if you give free media but the but the establishment media had a blockade on us so they didn't cover for example eslint Hartson at all in california they refused to talk about her right and and with Acacio cortez you got a little bit of press before the election and we figured out how to win and it was through volunteers and now we're doing in many other races kanye lang brent welder at center of washington post now has a huge story about brent welder out of Kansas because we're and they realized oh my god these guys are for real and now that a costume cartels got a little bit of or note to be fair a lot of attention after her win right what happened people like oh I love it I'm writing her in I want her connect Casey be my congresswoman we of course people want someone who's gonna represent them and is not taking corporate donor money and that they could trust of course of course all we needed was a little bit of free media to make that possible and so here we are two easy ways to follow young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and ii is ring the bell and when you do that YouTube you're notified of our videos
