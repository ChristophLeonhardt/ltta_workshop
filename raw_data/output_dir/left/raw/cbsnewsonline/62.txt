DEFINED TASK. 

29
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,582
WE WANT TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. 

30
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:53,452
WE WANT TO HAVE LOW TAXES. 

31
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:57,824
WE WANT TO CUT THE HELL OUT OF 

32
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:58,158

33
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,360
WE WANT -- WE WANT REGULATIONS. 

34
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,729
SOMEONE VERY POPULAR GUY HERE 

35
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,495
WAS JUST INTERVIEWING ME. 

36
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,133
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT. 

37
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,034
GREAT GUY. 

38
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,137
HE SAID WHAT DID YOU THINK OF 

39
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,605
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH? 

40
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:17,911
I SAID I'M SORRY, I WATCHED IT 

41
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,412
BUT I FELL ASLEEP. 

42
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:25,451
I FOUND HE IS VERY GOOD, VERY 

43
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:25,984
GOOD FOR SLEEPING. 

44
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:27,620
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE 

45
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,953
IN CREDIT. 

46
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:29,522
HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT 

47
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,424
FOR THIS INCREDIBLE THING 

48
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,092
THAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR 

49
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,359
COUNTRY. 

50
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,361
IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT -- I HAVE 

51
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,963
TO SAY THIS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. 

52
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:40,400
IT WASN'T HIM BUT WOULD HAVE 

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,368
BEEN THE SAME THING. 

54
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,505
IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT IN WITH 

55
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,907
THEIR AGENDA IN NOVEMBER OF 

56
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,843
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO, INSTEAD 

57
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:53,847
OF HAVING 4.2 UP I BELIEVE YOU 

58
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,747
WOULD HAVE 4.1 DOWN. 

59
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,350
YOU WOULD BE IN NEGATIVE 

60
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,783
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW. 

61
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,186
YOU WOULD BE A NEGATIVE NUMBER. 

62
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:00,886
WE WERE HEADING SOUTH. 

63
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,189
YOU LOOK AT THOSE BAD NUMBERS 

64
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,825
THAT WERE THERE IN THE LAST 

65
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,859
COUPLE OF YEARS. 

66
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,961
IT WAS THIS WAY AND GOING IN 

67
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,829
THE WRONG DIRECTION. 

68
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,165
IT WAS THE WEAKEST RECOVERY IN 

69
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,167
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 

70
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,668
SINCE, I GUESS -- TO BE 

71
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,836
SPECIFIC BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE 

72
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,404
THEY HAVE GONE ANY FURTHER 

73
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,006
SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN 

74
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:20,606
THE 20s. 

75
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:24,344
IT WAS THE WEAKEST RECOVERY WE 

76
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,712
HAVE EVER HAD. 

77
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,179
BARELY A RECOVERY. 

78
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,848
NOW THIS IS CALLED NOT 

79
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:36,022
RECOVERY, THIS IS CALLED ROCKET 

80
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:36,622
SHIP WHAT'S HAPPENED. 

81
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:37,824
TODAY, TODAY NUMBERS CAME OUT 

82
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,058
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

83
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,292
MAKES ME HAPPY. 

84
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:40,893
THE NUMBERS WERE GREAT. 

85
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,695
THE JOB NUMBERS WERE GREAT. 

86
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,930
THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN 

87
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,230
INCREDIBLE. 

88
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,797
ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING. 

89
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:49,469
TOOK ME A FEW MONTHS TO GET THE 

90
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:49,836
ENGINE STARTED. 

91
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,803
WE DID THAT WITH REGULATION. 

92
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,805
WE DID THAT BY FREEING IT UP. 

93
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:58,745
YOU HAD PIPELINES THAT COULDN'T 

94
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,880
BE BUILT. 

95
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,248
I IMMEDIATELY APPROVED THEM. 

96
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:02,481
DAKOTA. 

97
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,215
HOW ABOUT DAKOTA ACCESS? 

98
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,883
THAT WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION. 

99
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:05,250
I APPROVED IT. 

100
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,954
I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE 

101
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,221
PROTESTS. 

102
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:08,755
NOBODY CALLED ME. 

103
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,656
THEY JUST BUILT THE PIPELINE. 

104
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,391
ITS BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE. 

105
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,059
LOT OF JOBS. 

106
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,193
IT WAS VERY UNFAIR. 

107
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,562
THEY GOT THEIR APPROVALS AND 

108
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,395
THEN SAID YOU HAVE YOUR 

109
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,364
APPROVAL BUT YOU CAN'T BUILD 

110
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:18,530
IT. 

111
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,167
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BUILD 

112
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:21,367
IT. 

113
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,237
I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NEVER BE 

114
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:24,670
ABLE TOA BUILD IT. 

115
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,239
I APPROVED IT ON DAY ONE. 

116
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,643
THE SAME THING WITH KEYSTONE. 

117
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,744
I APPROVED KEYSTONE. 

118
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,745
TOTAL OF 48,000 JOBS. 

119
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,781
MORE IMPORTANTLY TWO GREAT 

120
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,047
PROJECTS. 

121
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:35,581
WE APPROVED THEM BOTH 

122
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:36,149
IMMEDIATELY. 

123
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,250
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN STUCK. 

124
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,183
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN STUCK. 

125
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,453
YOU WERE NEVER GETTING THAT 

126
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:40,720
APPROVED. 

127
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,655
SO MANY PEOPLE THANKED ME FOR 

128
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:42,855
THAT. 

129
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,390
I GUESS MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN I 

130
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,857
WALKED IN. 

131
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:49,295
I WAS WALKING IN WITH KEVIN AND 

132
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,697
WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR AND A 

133
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,731
STRONG MAN CAME UP TO ME. 

134
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,668
A TOUGH, KIND OF A GUY. 

135
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,237
HE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU, 

136
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,240
MR. PRESIDENT FOR SAVING OUR 

137
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,540
COUNTRY. 

138
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,577
HE HAD -- HE HAD TEARS COMING 

139
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,111
DOWN HIS EYES. 

140
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,680
HE HAD -- THIS WASN'T JUST A 

141
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:07,980
STATEMENT. 

142
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,949
HE HAD TEARS COMING DOWN UNLESS 

143
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,151
HE WAS -- A REAL WISE GUY. 

144
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,187
HE HAD TEARS COMING DOWN HIS 

145
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:14,387
EYES. 

146
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,990
HE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU MR. 

147
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,658
PRESIDENT FOR SAVING OUR 

148
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,058
COUNTRY. 

149
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,195
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF 

150
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,364
THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT YOU 

151
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,065
HAVE TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S 

152
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,268
SO UNFAIR TO YOU AND IT'S SO 

153
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,037
UNFAIR TO ALL OF THE MILLIONS 

154
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:35,508
AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 

155
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:39,045
THAT VOTED FOR YOU. 

156
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:39,345
IT'S TRUE. 

157
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,380
THANK YOU. 

158
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,980
THANK YOU. 

159
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,583
SO, SO I REALLY APPRECIATED 

160
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:43,983
THAT. 

161
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,286
IT'S VERY HARD FOR REPUBLICANS 

162
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:46,719
AND CONSERVATIVES. 

163
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,588
WE HAVE A GREAT JUDGE RIGHT NOW 

164
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,057
BEING LOOKED AT TO GO UP AND BE 

165
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,559
THE NEXT JUSTICE OF THE UNITED 

166
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,293
STATES SUPREME COURT. 

167
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:58,064
THIS IS A GREAT MAN, IS HE A 

168
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,397
FINE PERSON. 

169
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:02,402
THE WAY THEY ARE SCREAMING AND 

170
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,669
SHOUTING AND IT'S A DISGRACE TO 

171
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:04,136
OUR COUNTRY. 

172
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:07,340
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS BEEN 

173
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,673
WATCHING IT. 

174
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,442
THEY ARE MAKING FOOLS OF 

175
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:09,742
THEMSELVES. 

176
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,244
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE I WILL RUN 

177
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,079
AGAINST IN TWO AND A HALF 

178
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,312
YEARS. 

179
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,280
I WILL RUN AGAINST THEM AND I 

180
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,047
LOOK FORWARD TO IT. 

181
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:21,687
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE IT 

182
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:21,887
BACK. 

183
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,055
SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. 

184
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,724
THE COURT SYSTEM IS VERY 

185
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,024
IMPORTANT. 

186
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,294
I WILL BE APPOINTING AND HAVE 

187
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,296
APPOINTED A RECORD NUMBER OF 

188
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,063
JUDGES. 

189
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:33,266
WE ARE GOING TO BE DISTRICT 

190
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,600
COURT JUDGES, COURT OF APPEALS, 

191
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,369
SUPREME COURT, AND ONE OF THE 

192
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,237
REASONS THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO 

193
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,540
GET KEVIN IN IS JUST THAT. 

194
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,341
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT COULD 

195
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:42,909
CHANGE VERY QUICKLY. 

196
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,044
WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE, YOU 

197
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,879
KNOW, THIS WILL BE HOPEFULLY 

198
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,982
EVERYTHING GOES VERY WELL WITH 

199
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:50,883
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

200
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,417
IS HE CENTRAL CASTING. 

201
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:55,188
TEN YEARS AGO THEY SAID HE WILL 

202
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:55,821
BE A SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 

203
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,290
THE INTELLIGENCE IS 

204
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,491
EXTRAORDINARY AND THE MAN IS 

205
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:58,858
EXTRAORDINARY. 

206
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,593
THEY WERE SAYING THIS YEARS 

207
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:00,793
AGO. 

208
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,795
I HEARD IT EVEN BEFORE I EVER 

209
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,863
THOUGHT I WOULD BE DOING THIS 

210
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,699
THAT THERE WAS A MAN NAMED 

211
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,466
KAVANAUGH WHO IS EXTRAORDINARY. 

212
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,569
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE WANTON 

213
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:11,170
THE SUPREME COURT. 

214
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,441
WE HAVE TWO OF THEM, WE WILL 

215
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,444
HAVE HIM HOPEFULLY AND WE HAVE 

216
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:22,315
JUSTICE GORSUCH WHO IS JUST AN 

217
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:22,715
OUTSTANDING MAN. 

218
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,549
I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. 

219
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,550
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT GOING. 

220
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,387
IF WE DON'T KEEP IT GOING THAT 

221
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:28,654
CHANGES. 

222
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,890
IF IT CHANGES THAT AFFECTS YOUR 

223
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,691
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, SO 

224
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,191
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. 

225
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,794
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO IT BUT 

226
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,497
IT AFFECTS SO MANY DIFFERENT 

227
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,698
ELEMENTS OF YOUR LIFE. 

228
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,000
I KNOW IT'S A BIG NATIVE 

229
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,201
AMERICAN POPULATION AND I KNOW 

230
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:48,241
ITS BEEN VERY TOUGH AND I KNOW 

231
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,776
HEIDI HASN'T DONE A GOOD JOB IN 

232
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,544
TAKING CARE OF THEM. 

233
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,615
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE 

234
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,883
RIGHT CHOICES, MAYBE THEY DON'T 

235
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,884
KNOW ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON 

236
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,386
WITH RESPECT TO THE WORLD OF 

237
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,322
WASHINGTON AND POLITICS BUT I

241
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,797
AS I READ A LIST OF THE WORST 

242
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:14,433
THINGS YOU HAVE HEARD. 

243
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,402
HIGHEST CRIME RATES, WORST 

244
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,002
EDUCATION, LOWEST HOMEOWNER 

245
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,138
SHIP AND I READ LIKE TEN ITEMS 

246
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,139
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET. 

247
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,974
THEY GAVE ME A LIST. 

248
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,277
I WAS MAKING A SPEECH AND I'M 

249
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,045
READING ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE 

250
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,612
THINGS ABOUT CRIME AND 

251
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,515
EDUCATION AND HOME AND SO MANY 

252
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:29,749
THINGS. 

253
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,518
I JUST SAID, WHAT DO YOU HAVE 

254
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:32,851
TO LOOSE? 

255
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:33,352
VOTE FOR ME. 

256
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:38,457
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOOSE? 

257
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:38,890
YOU REMEMBER THAT? 

258
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,326
MY PEOPLE ALL CAME UP TO ME AND 

259
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,527
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. 

260
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,496
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. 

261
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,997
I SAID WHY? 

262
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,398
THE RESPONSE WAS INCREDIBLE. 

263
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:46,598
WHY? 

264
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,401
I USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND 

265
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,972
FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, WE WENT WAY 

266
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,138
UP. 

267
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,475
NOW WE HAVE PRODUCED BECAUSE 

268
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,077
NOW AFRICAN AMERICAN, 

269
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,612
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE BEST 

270
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,113
NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

271
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:01,379
COUNTRY. 

272
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,415
BEST NUMBER MEANING IT'S AT THE 

273
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:12,391
LOWEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

274
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:12,658
COUNTRY. 

275
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,059
ASIAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC 

276
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,728
AMERICAN AND WOMEN OF 65 YEARS. 

277
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:16,995
HISPANIC. 

278
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:17,329
THINK OF IT. 

279
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,199
IT'S THE BEST NUMBER IN THE 

280
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,867
HISTORY OF YOUR COUNTRY. 

281
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,302
ASIAN IS THE LOWEST IN THE 

282
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,069
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

283
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,773
I SAY WITH RESPECT TO THE 

284
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,575
NATIVE AMERICANS THAT I GO 

285
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,876
RIGHT BACK TO WHERE I WAS TWO 

286
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:34,113
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 

287
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,181
CAMPAIGNING, WHAT DO YOU HAVE 

288
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:35,813

00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:40,452
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOOSE? 

290
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,221
YOU PUT KEVIN INTO THAT 

291
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,322
POSITION AND YOU WILL SEE 

292
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,825
THINGS HAPPEN THAT YOU WILL 

293
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,425
NEVER SEE WITH HEIDI. 

294
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:51,697
YOU JUST NEVER ARE GOING TO SEE 

295
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,632

296
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:54,299

SO, I HAVE A LIST AND THE LIST 

301
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,579
GOES ON AND ON. 

302
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:10,516
IT'S FOUR PAGES OF THINGS THAT 

303
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,316
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 

304
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,385
ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT PERIOD 

305
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,052
OF TIME, LESS THAN TWO YEARS. 

306
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:18,990
THIS GOES ON AND ON AND ON. 

307
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,792
IF I READ IT TO YOU -- THIS IS 

308
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:24,997

309
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,330
THING OKAY? 

310
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,303
SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE VERY 

311
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:30,603
BIG THINGS. 

312
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,774
MORE THAN 4 MILLION JOBS 

313
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:39,778
CREATED SINCE THE ELECTION. 

314
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:40,512
THINK OF THAT. 

315
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,716
201,000 JOBS JUST LAST MONTH, 

316
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,517
BRAND NEW JOBS. 

317
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,118
WAGES ARE GROWING AT THE 

318
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,121
FASTEST PACE IN NEARLY A DECADE 

319
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,524
AND WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING? 

320
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,226
DID YOU HEAR THAT? 

321
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:54,426
2.9%. 

322
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,093
IT'S LIKE THE BEST WAGE NUMBER 

323
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:59,364
THAT WE HAVE HAD IN MANY YEARS. 

324
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:03,769
THAT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY. 

325
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,404
TO ME, WE HAD GREAT JOBS 

326
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,038
NUMBERS THIS MORNING. 

327
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:07,706
THEY WERE JUST ANNOUNCED. 

328
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:08,607
THEY WERE FANTASTIC BUT THE ONE 

329
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,610
THAT STUCK OUT TO ME WAS THE 

330
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,078
WAGE. 

331
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,115
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO BE ABLE 

332
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:16,382
TO LIVE. 

333
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:16,648
TO LIVE. 

334
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:17,349
SO NOT ONLY UNEMPLOYMENT BUT 

335
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:20,386
THE WAGES ARE STARTING TO GO UP 

336
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:20,752
FOR PEOPLE. 

337
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,421
MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW EMPLOYED 

338
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,625

339
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,026
RECORDED HISTORY OF OUR 

340
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:27,293
COUNTRY. 

341
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,227
THINK ABOUT THAT. 

342
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,763
TODAY, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MORE 

343
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,132
PEOPLE WORKING THAN HAVE EVER 

344
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,432
WORKED. 

345
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,433
WE HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 

346
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:34,900
400,000. 

347
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,204

348
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,006
600,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS

SINCE MY ELECTION. 

350
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:42,708
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID YOU WON'T 

351
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,443
HAVE MANUFACTURING JOBS 

352
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:44,710

353
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,177
THEY AREN'T AROUND. 

354
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:45,577
THEY ARE AROUND. 

355
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:48,147
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE DONE 

356
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,448
FOR YOUR COAL INDUSTRY IT'S 

357
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:49,849
INCREDIBLE. 

358
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,853
WE HAD A MAN WHO IS IN THE 

359
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:54,954
MINING BUSINESS WHO SAID. 

360
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,523
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE COAL 

361
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,025
INDUSTRY IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE 

362
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:04,397
WE WERE DEAD AND NOW WE ARE V 

363
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,464

00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,740
I DON'T KNOW. 

372
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,241
WHO THE HELL KNOWS. 

373
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,576

THIS GUY WANTS TO PROTECT 

382
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,163

DOES EVERYBODY RECOGNIZE HIM?

00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:41,600
I DON'T.

DO YOU MIND? 

391
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
IT'S ALWAYS VERY DANGEROUS FOR 

392
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:49,608
ME. 

393
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,112

397
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,753
INDUSTRY HAD THE BOOT OF 

398
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,788
GOVERNMENT ON ITS THROAT. 

399
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,389
MANY, MANY JOBS WERE LOST AND 

400
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,258
MANY TOWNS WERE DESTROYED BY 

401
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:06,959
THIS. 

402
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,393
IT WAS JUST A HORRIBLE THING. 

403
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:09,195
HORRIBLE SUFFERING THAT 

404
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:13,666
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A 

405
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,266
MADE UP REASON, I THINK. 

406
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:14,967
WHAT YOUR ADMINISTRATION HAS 

407
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:27,145
DONE IS BRING US BACK TO LIFE. 

408
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:30,950
JOBS HAVE BEEN -- JOBS HAVE 

409
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,852

PLACES REALLY SURVIVE BECAUSE 

415
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,561
THEY HAVE A GREAT COAL MINE AND

00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,864
A GREAT POWER PLANT AND IT'S 

417
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,797
WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT.

00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,300
IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT WE AGAIN 

419
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,900

SO NICE. 

424
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:03,048
I COULD STAND UP HERE AND TALK 

425
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,486
ABOUT COAL FOR A HALF HOUR AND 

426
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,355
I COULDN'T DO AS GOOD A JOB AS 

427
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:09,755

428
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:14,160

00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,283
LOT OF MONEY ON THE DUMP SEAL 

444
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,383

00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,769
THE GREAT THINGS TO BE TALKING 

457
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:58,002

HIGHEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED.

00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:23,095
THAT'S NOT BAD, RIGHT? 

471
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,699
THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIG ONES. 

472
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,567
AMERICAN PENSIONS HAVE GROWN 

473
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,970
MORE THAN TWO TRILLON DOLLARS 

474
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,840
TERE VALUE SINCE THEE LIKES 

475
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,107
ELECTION. 

476
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,374
AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT. 

477
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:38,344
THE BEST EVER. 

478
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,845
THE BEST EVER. 

479
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,612
LOWEST NUMBER EVER. 

480
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:41,112
HISPANIC AMERICAN. 

481
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,681
ASIAN AMERICAN, WOMEN 65 YEARS, 

482
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,182
SORRY ABOUT THAT. 

483
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:47,519
IT'S -- I LIKE HISTORY BETTER. 

484
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,155
HISTORIC -- I JOKE BUT -- WOMEN 

485
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,289
AT 65 YEARS. 

486
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:55,494
BEST NUMBERS IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN 

487
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,428
65 YEARS. 

488
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:56,728
IT'S GOOD. 

489
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,397
IT'LL BE HISTORIC, I WOULD SAY 

490
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,933
BEST IN HISTORY VERY SHORTLY. 

491
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,301
PROBABLY ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. 

492
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:03,735
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. 

493
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:06,538
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT THE BEST IN 

494
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,172
HALF A CENTURY. 

495
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,174
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 

496
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,809
RECORDED FOR AMERICANS WITHOUT 

497
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,476
A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. 

498
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,779
NOBODY EVEN TALKS ABOUT THIS 

499
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,012
STUFF. 

500
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:15,514
THAT'S LIKE -- YOU PROBABLY 

501
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,982
NEVER HEARD OF THESE 

502
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:17,282
CATEGORIES. 

503
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:20,185
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT CATEGORIES 

504
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:20,752
TO ME. 

505
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:21,787
VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED 

506
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,124
IT'S LOWEST IN MORE THAN 20 

507
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:25,357
YEARS. 

508
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:25,957
THAT'S GOING UP RAPIDLY. 

509
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,325
I THINK IT'S WRONG. 

510
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,094
I THINK IT'S A HIGHER -- MUCH 

511
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,695
BETTER THAN THAT. 

512
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,297
IF IT'S NOT I WILL MAKE SURE IT 

513
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:33,299
IS. 

514
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,469
I WILL MAKE SURE. 

515
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,704
WE LOVE OUR VETERANS. 

516
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,304
ALMOST 3.9 MILLION AMERICANS 

517
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:46,145
HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD 

518
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:46,912
STAMPS SINCE MY ELECTION. 

519
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:51,083
3.9.

520
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,285
SO MEDICARE, THE DEMOCRATS WILL 

521
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:53,685
DESTROY MEDICARE. 

522
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,320
THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY YOUR 

523
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,720
SOCIAL SECURITY. 

524
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,554
WE ARE GOING TO SAVE IT. 

525
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:57,856
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT. 

526
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,057
WE AREN'T GOING TO TOUCH IT. 

527
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,893
DID YOU SEE WHAT I CAMPAIGNED I 

528
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,396
WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT SAID WE 

529
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,197
ARE NOT TOUCHING SOCIAL 

530
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:05,464
SECURITY? 

531
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,999
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT AND 

532
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,933
I SAID GROWTH. 

533
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,301
WE ARE GROWING FASTER THAN I 

534
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,272
PROJECTED THOUGH I THOUGHT WE 

535
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,105
WOULD BE AROUND THAT NUMBER. 

536
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,574
IF I SAID IT DURING THE 

537
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,775
CAMPAIGN THEY WOULD HAVE 

538
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,510
LAUGHED ME OFF THE STAGE. 

539
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,478
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO 

540
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
THAT FOR A LONG TIME. 

541
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,115
THAT HASN'T BEEN WORKING TOO 

542
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:23,949
WELL HAS IT? 

543
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,617
WE ARE GOING TO GROW A LOT 

544
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:25,850
FASTER. 

545
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,986
WE ARE DOING WELL AND YOU HAVE 

546
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:28,286
THE 4.2. 

547
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:31,023
WE WILL GO HIGHER THAN THAT. 

548
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:37,028
MOST WOULD HAVE SAID 4.2, THAT 

549
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:40,832
WILL TAKE YEARS BUT IT DIDN'T. 

550
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:44,970
I SAID IT'LL GO MUCH HIGHER 

551
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,671
THAN ANYONE BELIEVES. 

552
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,805
WHEN WE FIX THE TRADE DEALS 

553
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,974
THAT HAS A BIG IMPACT. 

554
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,177
WE ARE LOSING 100 BILLION WITH 

555
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,813
MEXICO, WE ARE LOSING FROM 25 

556
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:55,814
TO 50 BILLION WITH CANADA, EVEN 

557
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,816
THOUGH THEY LIKE TO SAY WE HAVE 

558
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,283
NO DEFICIT. 

559
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,718
THEY ARE SMART IN SAYING THAT. 

560
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:05,790
THEY HAVE A SHEET OUT THAT IT'S 

561
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,157
$98.2 BILLION. 

562
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:08,760
THEY DON'T SHOW US THAT SHEET. 

563
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,463
THAT'S MEANT FOR OTHER REASONS. 

564
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,163
THEY SHOWED 98.2 BILLION. 

565
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,699
WE ARE WORKING ON A DEAL WITH 

566
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,031
CANADA. 

567
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,000
WE WILL SEE IF IT'S GOOD. 

568
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,635
IF IT'S GOOD FOR US, FOR THEM. 

569
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,704
I WANT IT TO BE GOOD FOR 

570
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:20,005
EVERYBODY. 

571
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:20,771
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO GET 

572
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:23,375
RIPPED OFF LIKE WE HAVE BEEN 

573
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,109
RIPPED OFF BEFORE. 

574
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,181
OUR FARMERS IMPORTANT TO ME. 

575
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:33,819
OUR FARMERS AND YOU ARE GREAT 

576
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,219
PATRIOTS. 

577
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,624
IT TAKES TIME BUT CHINA WASN'T 

578
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,524
LETTING YOU IN FOR PEANUTS. 

579
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:42,828
THE EU HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH ON 

580
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,028
YOU. 

581
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:43,695
THEY HAVE TRADE BARRIERS. 

582
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,863
THEY SELL US BUT WE AREN'T 

583
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,564
ALLOWED TO GO THERE THERE. 

584
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:47,833
I SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT. 

585
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,803
IF YOU DO THAT WE WILL TAX YOUR 

586
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:52,471
CARS. 

587
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:52,804
THAT'S EASY. 

588
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:53,372
THAT'S THE BIGGEST MONEY. 

589
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,807
THE CARS, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE 

590
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:56,007
CARS. 

591
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:56,574
THAT'S THE BIGGEST MONEY. 

592
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,410
THEY ARE ALL PUTTING CARS IN TO 

593
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,146
THE COUNTRY AND WE DON'T 

594
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:01,613
ESSENTIALLY TAX THEM. 

595
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:05,317
IT'S 2.5% BUT FOR THE MOST PART 

596
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:05,817
THEY DON'T PAY. 

597
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:08,320
THEY AREN'T USED TO PAYING THE 

598
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,321
UNITED STATES. 

599
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,556
NOW THEY ARE PAYING. 

600
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,824
IT'S ONLY 2.5% AND WITH THEM -- 

601
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:16,395
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR CARS AND IF 

602
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,730
THEY DO THEY HAVE A TARIFF MANY 

603
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,497
TIMES WHAT THEY PAY US. 

604
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:22,901
WE TAX THE CARS AND THEY SAY WE 

605
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,635
WILL MAKE A DEAL. 

606
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,437
EVERY TIME I HAVE A PROBLEM 

607
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,541
WITH ANY OF THESE -- MANY OF 

608
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,609
THESE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY THE 

609
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,810
BIG CAR COUNTRIE I SAY OKAY, 

610
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,945
WE CAN'T MAKE THE DEAL. 

611
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:34,279
THAT'S OKAY. 

612
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,814
I WILL PUT A 20% TAX ON YOUR 

613
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,451
CARS, WE WILL DO IT, WE WILL DO 

614
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,585
IT, WE WILL AGREE. 

615
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:40,952
WE WILL AGREE. 

616
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,955
I MEAN ACTUALLY IN SOME 

617
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,457
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING CANADA, A 

618
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,725
TAX ON CARS WOULD BE THE 

619
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,025
RUINING OF THE COUNTRY. 

620
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:50,094
THAT'S HOW BIG IT IS. 

621
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,563
IT WOULD RUIN THE COUNTRY. 

622
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,233
NOW, THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 

623
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,101
OF US FOR MANY DECADES. 

624
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,705
WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN 

625
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,305
ANYMORE. 

626
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,707
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN. 

627
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,208
THE EXPRESSION WE HAVE A 

628
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,409
COMPANY TO RUN. 

629
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,912
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN. 

630
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,747
WHEN I GET THESE HORRIBLE TRADE 

631
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,248
DEALS. 

632
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:13,452
THESE ARE ONE SIDED, HORRIBLE 

633
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,353
DEALS. 

634
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:14,786
I THINK NAFTS. 

635
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:24,263
PEOPLE FORGET BUT NAFTA HAS 

636
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:24,630
BEEN HORRIBLE. 

637
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,331
WORLD TRADE LET CHINA BECOME 

638
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,100
THIS BIG ECONOMIC POWER AND I 

639
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,903
SAID WE HAVE TO BE FAIR. 

640
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,903
WE CAN'T LET CHINA TAKE OUT 

641
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:34,606
$500 BILLION A YEAR OUT OF THE 

642
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,540
UNITED STATES AND REBUILD 

643
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,773
ITSELF. 

644
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:39,311
WE HAVE SOME OF THESE 

645
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:43,282
COUNTRIES, THEY ARE CONSIDERED 

646
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:43,715
GROWING ECONOMIES. 

647
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,450
THEY ARE CONSIDERED NATIONS IN 

648
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,255
THAT AREN'T MATURE SO WE PAY 

649
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:50,455
THEM. 

650
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:50,989
IT'S CRAZY. 

651
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,359
YOU KNOW, LIKE INDIA, LIKE 

652
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,862
CHINA, LIKE OTHERS, WE SAY THEY 

653
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,964
ARE GROWING, I WANT TO BE PUT 

654
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,632
DOWN THERE BECAUSE WE ARE 

655
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,767
GROWING TOO. 

656
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:07,439
WE WILL GROW FASTER THAN 

657
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:07,706
ANYTHING. 

658
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,408
YOU KNOW THEY CALL THEM 

659
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:09,875
DEVELOPING NATIONS. 

660
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,509
WE ARE A DEVELOPING NATION TOO. 

661
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:11,776
WE ARE. 

662
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,079
WE ARE -- AS FAR AS I'M 

663
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,048
CONCERNED WE ARE A DEVELOPING 

664
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,281
NATION. 

665
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,250
THEY CALL THEMSELVES DEVELOPING 

666
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,384
AND UNDER THAT CATEGORY THEY 

667
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,385
GET MONEY. 

668
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,887
WE HAVE TO PAY THEM. 

669
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,320
IT'S CRAZY. 

670
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,056
WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. 

671
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:31,028
WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. 

672
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,432
WE HAVE STOPPED IT. 

673
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:35,634
WHEN WE ARE SECURING MILITARY 

674
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,437
-- JOHN KELLY IS HERE. 

675
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,170
GENERAL KELLY. 

676
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,239
WHEN WE ARE SECURING THE 

677
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,941
WEALTHY COUNTRIES FROM OUTSIDE 

678
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,575
HARM BECAUSE WE ARE PAYING FOR 

679
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,144
THEIR MILITARY I THINK IT'S 

680
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,246
FINE BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY US 

681
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:48,546
FOR THIS. 

682
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:49,881
WE ARE WATCHING THE WHOLE WORLD 

683
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,616
AND THEY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. 

684
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,785
FOR YEARS AND YEARS WE HAVE 

685
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,353
BEEN PROTECTING THESE 

686
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:54,653
COUNTRIES. 

687
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,620
THEY ARE MAKING A FORTUNE. 

688
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,089
THEY ARE HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE 

689
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:58,590
MILITARY COSTS. 

690
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,158
WE HAVE THE BIGGEST MILITARY 

691
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:00,691
COSTS IN THE WORLD. 

692
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:03,361
MOST OF IT GOES TO PROTECTING 

693
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:03,795
OUTSIDE COUNTRIES. 

694
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,064
SOME OF THEM DON'T EVEN LIKE 

695
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:06,230
US. 

696
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,468
SOME OF THEM DON'T EVEN LIKE 

697
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:09,768
US. 

698
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,869
WE ARE PROTECTING COUNTRIES 

699
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,938
THAT HAVE -- I GOT GOT TO SAY 

700
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,139
THEY HAVE RESPECT FOR US NOW 

701
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,074
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE RESPECT 

702
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:16,307
FOR US. 

703
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:19,044
THEY GOT TO PAY. 

704
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,045
THEY GOT TO PAY. 

705
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:20,945
WHEN THEY ARE WEALTHY. 

706
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,582
WE WILL PROTECT PEOPLE THAT 

707
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:23,882
NEED HELP. 

708
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,985
THAT'S OKAY AND WE UNDERSTAND 

709
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:27,185
THAT. 

710
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:27,986
WHEN WE PROTECT WEALTHY 

711
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,488
COUNTRIES, I WON'T NAME THEM 

712
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,491
BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHO I'M 

713
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:32,858
TALKING ABOUT. 

714
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,493
THEY HAVE TO PAY. 

715
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,394
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE 

716
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,563
THE PROTECTOR OF THE WORLD AND 

717
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,864
LOOSE A FORTUNE AND HAVE OUR 

718
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,566
TAXPAYERS PAYING WHILE THESE 

719
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,902
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE LIVING VERY 

720
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:44,769
BEAUTIFULLY BECAUSE OF US. 

721
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,838
NOT FAIR. 

722
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:52,377
WE CHANGED THAT AROUND. 

723
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,378
I HOPE EVERYBODY [INAUDIBLE] 

724
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:57,482
BY THE WAY THEN THIS IDIOT 

725
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,517
WOODWARD WHO WROTE THIS FICTION 

726
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,185
BOOK SAID I SAID THAT BUT HE 

727
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,253
PUT IT IN A CRUDE MANNER. 

728
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:04,389
I -- THE CONCEPT IS TRUE BUT 

729
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,191
THE WAY IT WAS SAID WAS VERY -- 

730
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,693
YOU KNOW -- HEY, I WENT LIKE TO 

731
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:10,195
THE BEST COLLEGE, I DID A LOT 

732
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,898
OF -- YOU READ THIS THING AND 

733
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,432
THE QUOTES WERE WRONG. 

734
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:16,634
ALL THESE JOHN KELLY, GENERAL 

735
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:20,038
MATTICE WRITING -- I NEVER SAID 

736
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:20,372
THAT. 

737
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:20,972
I NEVER SAID THAT. 

738
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:21,305
IT'S FICTION. 

739
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:22,874
THEY DO PUT DOWN THE CONCEPT OF 

740
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,478
I SAID THAT AND ISN'T THAT 

741
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:26,978
HORRIBLE? 

742
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:27,445
ISN'T THAT CRUDE? 

743
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:27,812
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

744
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:29,714
I WANT TO HAVE OUR NATION 

745
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:31,817
PROTECTED AND I DON'T WANT TO 

746
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,019
BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY OTHER 

747
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,520
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. 

748
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,887
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

749
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:36,721
THEY RESPECT US MORE WHEN THEY 

750
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,824
HAVE TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND 

751
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,525
THEY CAN AFFORD TO PAY THEM. 

752
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,928
ITS GOING TO MAKE A BIG 

753
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,195
DIFFERENCE FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

754
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:52,170
YOU WAIT, YOU WATCH, YOU SEE. 

755
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,804
SO MANY OTHER THINGS. 

756
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,273
I COULD GO -- HELP WITH THE 

757
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:55,540
OLYMPICS. 

758
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,040
WE HAVE THE OLYMPICS. 

759
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,476
WE JUST GOT THE WORLD CUP. 

760
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,244
THAT'S SMALL STUFF. 

761
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:04,950
I MUST TELL YOU. 

762
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,350
WE OPENED NYAR. 

763
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,318
POTENTIALLY THE BIGGEST IN THE 

764
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:06,551
WORLD. 

765
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,620
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT 

766
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,153
FOR 45 YEARS. 

767
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:10,988
WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF 

768
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:13,124
REGULATIONS ELIMINATED IN THE 

769
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,427
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IN LESS 

770
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,561
THAN TWO YEARS. 

771
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,930
I HAVE CUT MORE REGULATIONS 

772
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,697
THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT 

773
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:21,633
REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THEY 

774
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:21,966
HAVE SERVED. 

775
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:23,301
I THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN JUST 

776
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:28,406
AS IMPORTANT AS THE TAX CUTS. 

777
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,108
REGULATORY RELIEF FOR COMMUNITY 

778
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:30,876
BANKS. 

779
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,342
THEY WERE DYING. 

780
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:31,809
THE COMMUNITY BANKS. 

781
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:33,745
NOW THEY CAN LOAN YOU MONEY. 

782
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,681
MAKE A GOOD DEAL, PLEASE. 

783
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,950

UNIONS TO COME SO THEY MAKE IT 

786
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,321
POSSIBLE FOR YOU. 

787
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,823
MY ADMINISTRATION IS PROVIDING 

788
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,524
MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE 

789
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:48,226
OPTIONS FOR AMERICANS THROUGH 

790

791
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:50,729

WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF HEALTH 

793
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:53,031

WE HAD IT BEATEN BUT THAT'S A 

795
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:55,934
LONG STORY. 

796
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,935
WE REPEALED AND REPLACED BUT WE 

797
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,702

802
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,046
HEIDI'S VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN 

803
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:08,279
GREAT. 

804
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,013
SHE VOTED AGAINST IT. 

805
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,982
WE GOT IF YOU REMEMBER THE 

806
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,150
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS WIPED 

807
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,350
OUT. 

808
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,718
WE WIPED OUT THE INDIVIDUAL 

809
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,254
MANDATE WHICH IS THE MOST 

810
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,056
UNPOPULAR PART OF OBAMA CARE. 

811
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:18,523
WE WIPED IT OUT. 

812
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,592
THEN I HAVE THREE MORE PAGES. 

813
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:25,697

OKAY? 

817

ISN'T THIS MUCH -- ISN'T THIS 

818
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:32,370
MUCH MORE EXCITING THAN 

819
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,007
LISTENING TO PRESIDENT OBAMA 

820
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:36,474
SPEAK? 

821
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,509
BECAUSE WE GET THINGS DONE. 

822
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,711

825
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:42,380
PEOPLE. 

826
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,651

839
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,740
ONE OF THINGS I WANTED IS I 

840

DON'T WANT OUR COMPANIES AND I 

841
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:11,809
JUST -- INSIST ON IT. 

842
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,846
I DON'T WANT OUR COMPANIES 

843
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,450

844
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,185
FIRING EVERYBODY, LOSING THESE 

845
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,352
GREAT COMPANIES AND GREAT JOBS. 

846
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:24,389
THAT'S WHAT I INSIST ON WITH 

847
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,056
TREAD DEALS. 

848
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,858

857
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:39,971

WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE POURING IN 

886
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,470

887
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:45,670

888
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,271
WITH THESE LOTTERIES. 

889
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:46,805
WE HAVE LOTTERIES FROM 

890
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:47,972
COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE COME IN 

891
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:48,405
THROUGH A LOTTERY. 

892
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,075
DO YOU THINK THAT THESE 

893
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,977
COUNTRIES ARE SENDING US THEIR 

894
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:53,210
FINEST? 

895
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,744
I DON'T THINK SO. 

896
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:55,113
THEY WOULD SAY THAT'S A 

897
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,381
TERRIBLE THING TO SAY. 

898
00:26:56,381 --> 00:27:00,385
I MEAN WHEN I HIT MS13 AND I 

899
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,287
CALLED THEM ANIMALS, THEY ARE. 

900
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,689
NANCY PELOSI SAY HOW DARE HE 

901
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,890
SAY THAT ABOUT ANOTHER HUMAN 

902
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,123
BEING? 

903
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:09,260
NO, WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH. 

904
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,998
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR LAW 

905
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:18,603
ENFORCEMENT LIKE THEY PROTECT 

906
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:18,770
US. 

907
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,772
ICE IS UNDER SEIGE AND THE LAW 

908
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,472
ENFORCEMENT IS UNDER SEIGE AND 

909
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,074
THEY WANT WEAK LAW ENFORCEMENT 

910
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,677
AND THEY WANT TO HAVE CRIME 

911
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:25,943
COME IN. 

912
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:29,013
LOOK AT CHICAGO WITH THE 

913
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:32,617
LIBERAL MAYOR WITH THESE STUPID 

914
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,053

915
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,823
I MEAN TWO WEEKS AGO. 

916
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,825
68 PEOPLE SHOT, 12 DIED. 

917
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,092
CHICAGO. 

918
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:41,559
THAT'S OUR COUNTRY. 

919
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,360
I MEAN EXCUSE THE CRIME FIGURES 

920
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,229
BECAUSE THE CRIME FIGURES IN 

921
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,630
THE UNITED STATES ARE DOING 

922
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:45,830
WELL. 

923
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,035
YOU ADD THAT'S A LOT OF 

924
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,502
ADDITION IN TERMS OF NUMBERS. 

925
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:52,536
THAT WILL GET STRAIGHTENED OUT. 

926
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:54,105
THAT'S EASY TO STRAIGHTEN OUT 

927
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,140
IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT POLICY. 

928
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,075
