1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,840
- You really embrace this idea of

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,610
right place, right time.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,330
Do you ever wonder what
things would've been like

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,220
if you had ended up in a different dorm?

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,960
- I mean, suffice it to say,

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,860
my life would be very, very different.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,690
When I think about counterfactuals,

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,400
well what if I had been
in a different place

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,900
or at a different time,

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,970
there's no doubt my life would've taken

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,380
a very different route
and I could very well

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,470
just be one of the 99% who's working hard

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,770
and not able to make ends meet.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,560
Mark Zuckerberg and I went on a walk

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,700
a couple months after we'd taken,

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,100
excuse me, after Facebook had launched

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,860
and we had an equity conversation.

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,210
I came out of the gate saying,

19
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,510
you know I want 10% of the company.

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,343
- It was a rainy day right?

21
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:50,520
- It was a rainy night,

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,710
it was a horrible way to
have the conversation.

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,450
He was stressed, I was stressed.

24
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,850
It was not the best setup

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,060
and I made the case for 10%.

26
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,230
He said, I don't think
you've earned that much.

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,269
I caved pretty fast,
and in the book I say,

28
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,160
it was at once a spectacular
failure of negotiation

29
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,130
and also the most successful
conversation of my life,

30
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,460
because that 2% of Facebook ended up being

31
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,360
worth nearly half a billion
dollars a decade later.

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,520
What seemed like passing
conversations in the rain

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,540
in college,

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,000
can have these outsized effects.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,410
And that's a new phenomenon.

36
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,070
Never before in history
have twenty somethings

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,910
been able to create these companies.

38
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,110
I mean, Facebook is now
work 500 billion dollars.

39
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,070
- At what point did you realize the weight

40
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,800
of that conversation,

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,020
on the impact on your life?

42
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,250
- You know there was never one
particular moment afterward.

43
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,670
Facebook just kept
growing and in some sense

44
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,810
the goalpost kept moving.

45
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,120
You know when we had 6,000
people at Harvard on it,

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,860
we're like, well this is amazing.

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,490
We have to open it up to other schools

48
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,330
and see if they're interested.

49
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:03,470
And then people from
those schools flooded in

50
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,640
and over time we went
from college students

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,139
to everyone, general population,

52
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,179
later international.

53
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,090
And there was a moment,
I guess a couple years,

54
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,600
in 2006,

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,760
Yahoo offered us a billion dollars.

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,720
It was a lot of money at a very young age

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,720
and the question at the time was,

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,450
do we take this or do we not?

59
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,880
And Mark and the board
made the decision not to.

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,360
If you had asked me two years before that,

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,070
we were offered a billion
dollars for Facebook.

62
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,003
Clearly that's the definition of success,

63
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:42,330
there's no question that that
would've been a good decision.

64
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,780
But you know Mark made the right call

65
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,700
and the goalpost moved yet again.

66
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,330
There were just a series of moments when

67
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,110
it just got bigger and bigger and bigger,

68
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,100
and it continually reset
my expectations and,

69
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,523
I think our collective expectations.

70
00:02:57,523 --> 00:00:00,000
(calm music)
