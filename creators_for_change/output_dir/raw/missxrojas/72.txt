00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> and welcome to day 5 of vlogmas</font>

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,510
this video is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going up very late because</font>

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got slightly carried away preparing to</font>

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,160
make this and now my phone is telling me

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's time for bed I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone else has the bedtime thing on</font>

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that phone I try to go to bed by 11</font>

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,490
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single night and I've done so</font>

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,990
pretty effectively for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past little</font>

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,210
while and but today is not that day

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,670
because I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of lost in this topic</font>

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,189
of identity politics it's a phrase that

13
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,289
I've been hearing a lot over the past

14
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,930
week because all of a sudden a lot of

15
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,580
these thick pieces have come out about

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,830
whether identity politics is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> death</font>

17
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,750
of liberalism or should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the death of</font>

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,969
liberalism or the death of identity

19
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,790
politics will make liberalism possible

20
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,770
to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and either all of these back</font>

21
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,350
and forth pieces and so much great and

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,230
some of which just are sort of like spun

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,390
out just to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another piece on the</font>

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,039
roster sort of thing so identity

25
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,570
politics is a phrase that I personally

26
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">have heard mostly in the majority of</font>

27
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,079
context and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when here in a pejorative</font>

28
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,329
context it's mostly used in the smoke

29
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,100
ceiling sort of way like we all

30
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,379
understand what this idea means you know

31
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,539
I kind of worry about those phrases that

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,060
mostly function in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way because they</font>

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,000
signal some irritation<font color="#CCCCCC"> some common</font>

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,640
opposition's some assumed position and

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,960
having been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of very</font>

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,220
uncomfortable or sometimes scary

37
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,159
situations where my position is assumed

38
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,020
to be aligned with someone whose

39
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,340
position is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different for me</font>

40
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,049
especially when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that person expresses</font>

41
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,409
that they love weapons for example then

42
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,680
I find it difficult to I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,329
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at those phrases that</font>

44
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything other than Marcus of those</font>

45
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,390
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> identities and of a kind of</font>

46
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,899
thinking that dismisses the challenges

47
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,659
that are posed for people of color and

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,820
for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their genders and other</font>

49
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,280
physical abilities and so on so yeah

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,380
something of delving into a lot it's I'm

51
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering whether the phrase identity</font>

52
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,000
politics in its pejorative use is a kind

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,420
of grown-up version of sjw that

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,770
kind of phrase in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

55
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,930
to talk about at risk in context of the

56
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,460
USA because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where I live right</font>

57
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,680
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in indiana</font>

58
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,350
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the recent election</font>

59
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,300
and that's where a lot of the pieces

60
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,190
I've been reading recently have have

61
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,780
come out I do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

62
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,510
that needs to be discussed in the UK and

63
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,420
I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many discussions about</font>

64
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,520
race and gender including in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK</font>

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,940
focus on us examples and us<font color="#CCCCCC"> texts and I</font>

66
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,620
think that this sometimes contributes to

67
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,860
the idea that the UK has fewer race and

68
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,600
gender related problems which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,130
believe is the case I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to</font>

70
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,420
subvert this but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

71
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,070
just want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be mindful of as I go into</font>

72
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this video and it's also something that</font>

73
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm think you're not about as I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,170
the new year a new year making videos

75
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,050
and also of being<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible about what</font>

76
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,180
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> making and what I share as well so my</font>

77
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is what identity politics means</font>

78
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,580
whether it is necessarily polarizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

79
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,989
whether we need to be sort of calling

<font color="#E5E5E5">for an end to it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mark limited in his</font>

New York Times opinion piece I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,790
going to answer all of these questions

83
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,320
today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about some</font>

84
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I've read and some reactions and</font>

85
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,920
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about other questions that we</font>

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,420
maybe we should be asking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

87
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,160
invite you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that too I by no means</font>

88
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,780
want you to consider this the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font>

89
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,900
I think maybe think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as a really</font>

90
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,330
long paragraph before the word discuss

91
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,519
an exam question the other thing I keep

92
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,720
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I don't know how</font>

93
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,549
connect to this is to the everything

94
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,610
else I'm about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about but is a</font>

95
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,230
Theresa May's derision of the phrase

96

citizen of the world and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

97
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,450
something that's been a bee in my bonnet

98
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,100
for a little while because in<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">division of it it demands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of</font>

100
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,100
loyalty and allegiance to a nation and

101
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,830
more than that to her view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that</font>

102
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,739
nation represents and what it requires

103
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,720
of its citizens and who it matters those

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,820
citizens to be in my mind what that's

105
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,250
requiring is kind of normalizing that

106
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,510
aligns itself with a predominantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> white</font>

107
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,760
english-speaking norm that isolates

108
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,000
herself and puts its nation first beyond

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,590
anything else like that's its ultimate

110
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,299
priority so that's something that's been

111
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,769
playing into a lot this thinking like

112
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,510
where does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of nation and</font>

113
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,510
nationhood and what the national norm

114
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,340
and what that represents what does that

115
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,310
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the way we think about chrome</font>

116

important but you cannot understand them

if you do not first understand the

founding fathers achievement in

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,970
establishing a system of government

about the time and the labor the unpaid

suppression of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> closing down of</font>

319
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,360
polling stations of learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here</font>

320
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,790
in Indiana the polls close<font color="#CCCCCC"> at 6pm who</font>

321
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,769
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to polls when polls close at 6pm</font>

322
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,540
it just makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> me think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

323
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,939
increasingly disturb<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ram by the</font>

324
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,399
expectation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> white identity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

325
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,980
be the norm and should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

326
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,649
fade into the background and be unseen

327
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,629
and unnamed and so here is where I've

328
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:57,449
landed trumpism is a community movement

329
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,079
of whiteness but that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a result</font>

330
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,559
or as a reaction to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

331
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,709
malicious or colluding effort by people

332
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,879
of color of people who identify as LGBTQ

333
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,160
of women or<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who identify as any</font>

334
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,429
other gender and that made white people

335
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,980
feel victimized and unhurt what I'm

336
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,419
realizing more and more is that

337
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:23,399
whiteness has been gathering like this

338
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,290
for a long long time and it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

339
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,169
wonder whether this happened because

340
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:34,980
whiteness was threatened or whether it

341
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,949
was simply named or whether naming

342
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,030
whiteness in itself threatens it

343
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,650
and I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be tying myself up in</font>

344
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,190
knots here but that's kind of where I've

345
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,160
landed and I would love to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear your</font>

346
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,480
thoughts and it's 11 21 so much editors

347
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,780
and go to bed after operating it and I

348
00:12:57,780 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">will see you tomorrow</font>
