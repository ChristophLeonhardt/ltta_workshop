I am Director X. I’m the
director of ‘Superfly’ 2018.
“I want to up our supply."
This scene is
Trevor and Michael
as Priest and Scatter,
the student and mentor.
On a couple levels,
you know Scatter
is Priest’s mentor
in the drug game
and also his teacher in
martial arts and jujitsu.
The wide shots are
really stunt people.
And then when you get
closer, obviously it’s them.
Trevor actually has been doing
capoeira for maybe 10 years,
so he’s really excited
and really capable
to do these kinds of things.
And he was there a week
ahead of time doing the work
and getting the
choreography down.
Michael isn’t trained as far
as I know, but he’s a dancer.
He came out of a
dance background.
So physicality is still
pretty second nature to him.
So he didn’t spend as
much time rehearsing this,
but he’s a pro.
He can get there and make
it happen pretty quickly.
“You ain’t that good."
