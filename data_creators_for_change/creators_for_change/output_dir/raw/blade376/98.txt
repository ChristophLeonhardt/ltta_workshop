1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
do you know what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yet a drumstick</font>

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,680
and you know I use it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> no not for</font>

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,740
drumming but for this yeah the camera

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,240
because i'm at a distance and although i

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,550
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little device it's good for</font>

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,139
zooming in and out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for recording and</font>

7
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,609
turning the camera off but when I want

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,270
to do white balance or focus or change

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,810
the contrast I have to reach and with

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,720
touch screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can adjust it so there</font>

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,939
you go little tip there for all you were

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,949
video because it feels good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be just</font>

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,050
blogging I feel like I haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,640
for a long time I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel like I</font>

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">just don't let you into my life enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about you know the issues that</font>

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,460
matter to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but do you really know much</font>

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">about Who I am as a person as of may</font>

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">27th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year i had hit six years on</font>

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,210
youtube which is such a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and i</font>

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,710
guess it just gave me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to</font>

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,539
reflect because when i started doing

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,570
youtube I was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more fun I guess I</font>

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,550
was more about comedy and just being

25
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,710
crazy and immature if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen</font>

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,690
the first ever video I've done dude

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,339
check it out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just interesting to</font>

28
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,439
see how far<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've come and I thought</font>

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,760
maybe I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just sort of like</font>

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,880
lighten up a bit and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,680
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is my next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video really</font>

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna send a strong message but just I</font>

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,420
say be myself I've always been myself

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,040
but I guess just let go it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I talk about my video is quite</font>

36
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,460
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's something we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,080
try I mean I've always been<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,509
good time just I could be having a

39
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,540
better time<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially on this channel</font>

40
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,220
so here's an idea right there have been

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,130
many stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've told in the past many</font>

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,460
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that have never</font>

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,170
actually made it onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube I've</font>

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,810
mentioned them in other forms may be in

45
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">person or on various</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other websites um</font>

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,689
and I don't see why I can't make videos

47
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,689
about those sort of things so if there's

48
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,979
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've mentioned before that</font>

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,719
hasn't been made into a youtube video

50
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,729
and you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a video on it</font>

51
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:04,140
just post it in the comments and I will

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,600
