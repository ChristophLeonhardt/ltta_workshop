“You’re so important to me.”
“I love you so much!”
“I didn’t think I
could love someone
for the rest of my life.”
Can I tell you
something that makes
me a little bit of a monster?
I hate marriage
proposal videos.
I hate the proposal video
inspired by the Pixar movie
“Up.”
I hate the Bruno Mars “Marry
You” proposal flash mob.
I hate the one where she
takes the world’s largest zip
line into the proposal.
I hate the one
where she thinks
she’s going to go
on the “Today” show
to talk about her
nonprofit work,
but she’s really only
there to be proposed to.
I really hate the one
where the guy tricks her
into thinking their plane is
crashing and then proposes.
But the one where
the guy stages
a fake arrest of
his girlfriend
and the only way for
her to beat the rap
is to agree to marry him —
“Can I see the ring?
Just for evidence?”
I probably hate
that one the most.
“Will you please, please marry me?”
“Will you marry me?”
“Will you marry me?”
I hate proposal videos because
they turn a private decision
between two people into
a big surprise that’s
sprung on just one of
them, usually a woman,
in a way that is so
dramatic in public
that it feels a
little bit coercive.
But the same thing that makes
these videos a little gross
is also what makes
them so popular.
“Yes!”
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
A part of me must love them
because every single one
of them, without
fail, makes me cry.
I hate that about them, too.
“Some birthdays are more
special than others.”
So much viral video is built
on these kinds of surprises.
Proposal videos,
promposal videos,
college acceptance videos,
soldiers coming home videos,
soldiers coming home
to their dogs videos.
“Aw!”
Pregnancy announcement
videos, gender reveal videos.
This is the YouTubification
of dramatic irony.
Everyone watching knows
what’s going to happen.
The surprises aren’t
surprising to us.
We don’t watch a viral
college acceptance video
to see whether the kid
actually gets into college.
We know they do.
We want to see them know it.
When we watch these
videos, we tend
to identify really strongly
with the person who’s
engineering the surprise.
Even if only for a
couple of moments,
we both know something
that somebody else doesn’t.
It makes us feel like a brave
soldier or a man in love.
It makes us feel important.
It makes us feel like Harvard.
It’s worth asking what this
emotional surprise porn has
in common with another
kind of surprise that
dominates online video —
The prank.
We inhale pranks of children,
and mothers, and perfectly
nice boyfriends —
“What’s on my neck?”
“It looks like a hickey.”
And really good dogs.
We prank dogs now.
Cats, too.
There’s a dark side to our
obsession with these videos.
Viral proposal videos often
work by scaring the target —
“Oh, my god!”
Before showering her
with everlasting love.
It creates the greatest
possible emotional whiplash
for the camera.
“No way!”
And it gives us this
powerful feeling of control.
People in the videos aren’t
the only ones affected.
Lisa Silvestri, who studies
digital culture in war,
suggests that surprise
homecoming videos
produce a feeling of
vicarious sacrifice.
When we watch them
and cry, she says,
we feel as if we’ve sacrificed
something, too, even if it’s
just our own complacency.
Which means we might
feel incredibly strong
positive vibes around issues
that we don’t necessarily
agree with.
A soldier’s
homecoming inspires
really warm and patriotic
feelings about the place
he’s coming home from —
the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq.
A college acceptance video
reinforces the vaguely
dystopian idea that
higher education is
a once-in-a-lifetime
privilege, not a right.
And a surprise
proposal video suggests
that the most important
moment of a woman’s life
is when a man chooses
her for marriage.
Maybe you already agree
with all of those things,
or maybe you don’t, but you
just want to feel something,
and that’s O.K., too.
You can keep your
surprise videos.
“I think she’s saying I
can’t do it right now.”
And I’ll keep mine.
“Hey, I’m Amanda.”
“I’m Shane.
“He edits the videos.”
“She writes the videos.”
"You watch the videos.”
“And if you like the videos,
like, comment and subscribe here.”
“And then tell us, what do you hate 
that everyone else seems to love.”
“Leave your answer in the comments.”
“We are very thirsty.”
