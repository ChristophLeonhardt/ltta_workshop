Omarosa needs to sell books and she's got a spew a bunch of lies and dirt to do that so I'm gonna tell you about it coming up today on the Hollywood conservative or the rebel Oh mo Rosa Omarosa Oh Rosa yeah as my southern mother would say young lady you have cooked your own goose Omarosa Manigault Newman the former White House adviser exited stage left from this administration I believe the end of last year I think it was December of 2017 the Trump administration trying to stay classy said that she resigned to pursue new opportunities but it was also reported by numerous short sources that she basically had to be dragged from the White House and now it's her turn to do the dragging now no one expected her to leave gracefully least of all me but you would think that if someone was given the opportunity to work on staff in the White House then they would have just a little bit of appreciation for the person who gave them that unbelievable once-in-a-lifetime opportunity now if you watch The Apprentice you know amaurosis personality she's not exactly a stable genius as president Trump likes to say she is definitely not a genius and she is most certainly not stable well she has a book coming out so she's doing the whole media circuit spilling all of the dirt and airing out all of her dirty laundry and her grievances with this president and his staff on The Today Show on NBC yesterday morning she aired an audio recording that she took on her cell phone when she was let go by General John Kelly White House chief of staff that this conversation happened and the recording took place inside the Situation Room as in ask if as in sensitive compartmented and for me facility as in holy hell this goes against every national security protocol there ever was now in this conversation Kelly discusses what he hopes will be a friendly departure mm-hmm fat chance without any difficulty in the future relative to her reputation it's funny that he chose those terms relative and reputation I guess when you have such a dismal reputation that every ugly story about you is relative anyway Omarosa says that she felt threatened because Kelly made it clear that things could get ugly for her if it wasn't a peaceful departure now I don't really see that as a threat that's just reality seems like she would know that since she's a reality star at all I don't know but again not a genius now naturally other members of the president's staff were asked about this notably press secretary Sarah Sanders and she had this to say the very idea a staff member would sneak a recording device into the White House Situation Room shows a blatant disregard for our national security and then to brag about it on national television further proves the lack of character and integrity of this disgruntled former White House employee deputy White House press secretary Hogan giddily also told Fox & Friends this on Monday morning the thought of doing something like that to a fellow employee not to mention the leader of the free world is completely disgraceful now apparently she also alleges in her upcoming book that President Trump is a racist which I can flatly and adamantly say is completely untrue also if he was racist why did she work for the man she campaigned with him everyone knows that a presidential campaign is a crucible of character it imposes such pressure on a person that every undesirable aspect of their personality is exacerbated and on full display so if she really thought that he was a racist that would have come out during his campaign and if that came out during his camp why does she agree to work for him why did she allegedly beg to work for him she got married at his freaking hotel in DC for crying out loud now look I know that she's just trying to sell books a girl's gotta eat she's got to get that paycheck but is it really worth her integrity for just some good book sales of course not but this is Omarosa so thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
