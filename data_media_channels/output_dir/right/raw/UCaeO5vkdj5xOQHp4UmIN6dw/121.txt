1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,317
- [Chanel] Good evening Mr. Shapiro.

2
00:00:01,317 --> 00:00:03,304
My name is Chanel
Powell, nice to meet you.

3
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:04,137
- You too!

4
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,828
- So I'm a liberal in
view, those are my views,

5
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:07,691
and while we have,

6
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:08,766
- [Ben] Well again, thank you for coming.

7
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:09,822
I appreciate when people
who disagree come.

8
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:10,734
- Well I appreciate you coming to

9
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,102
our campus and speaking with us.

10
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:13,658
So I came here essentially out of

11
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,101
support for YAF and I
also came here to listen

12
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:18,514
and learn from you,
from what you're saying.

13
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:19,995
I think it's important to see

14
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,850
opposite sides and discuss, right?

15
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,634
But my question to you is,

16
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:26,482
how do we essentially bridge the gap?

17
00:00:26,482 --> 00:00:28,410
From two different points of view,

18
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,256
how are we able to meet in the middle

19
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,873
by listening, I mean essentially,

20
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:33,911
we want the same thing, we
want better for our country

21
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,304
and better for our people.

22
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:36,679
Everyone in this room is our people.

23
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,288
How do we take care of them?

24
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,343
How do we meet in the middle
and take care of them?

25
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:41,183
- [Ben] Well I mean I think that we

26
00:00:41,183 --> 00:00:43,071
actually have to determine,
to be completely frank,

27
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:44,415
whether we do want the same things.

28
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:46,504
I think that sometimes
people on left and right

29
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,775
think they want the same
thing in vague terms,

30
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,045
like better country,

31
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:50,878
but we actually have to determine

32
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:51,711
what better country looks like.

33
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,554
So, do we want a country where there's

34
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,568
more freedom to rise
and fall economically?

35
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:56,896
Or do we want a country with more

36
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:59,707
enforced rigidity of income, for example.

37
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,367
That's an actual difference in goal.

38
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:04,543
Do we want a country where men and women

39
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:06,879
are free to pursue whatever lives

40
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,129
that they want,

41
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:12,240
encouraged to pursue
virtue at the same time?

42
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,885
Or do we see that encouragement

43
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:17,902
by social groups to virtue as a sort of

44
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:20,686
block and check on freedom.

45
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:22,422
There's certain areas where we have

46
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:23,933
to clarify exactly what we think

47
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,029
an ideal America looks like.

48
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,534
My ideal America is basically
John Stuart Mill's America.

49
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:30,068
You get to do whatever you want,

50
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:30,981
you wave your hand around
as much as you want

51
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:31,981
until you hit somebody in the face,

52
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,533
but that is also contingent on all of us

53
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,469
trying to act virtuously
toward our neighbor.

54
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,996
So I think that the great
genius of the founders,

55
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:40,100
that they were balancing the sort of

56
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,021
European enlightenment view of liberty

57
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,572
with a more traditionalist view

58
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,108
of what private citizenry looked like,

59
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,756
which was a duty-based private citizenry

60
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:47,815
of duty to your neighbor,

61
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,836
not based on what
government tells you to do.

62
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:51,368
I'm not sure that that's
what the ideal America

63
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,676
looks like necessarily for
a lot of folks on the left

64
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:56,093
who feel, perhaps, that individual rights

65
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:58,396
need to take a backseat
to collective solutions.

66
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,654
So for example, my ideal America

67
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,623
is not an America where the government

68
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:08,068
forces doctors to provide
care at a certain price.

69
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,900
Because I think that
a free market solution

70
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,892
is not just better for healthcare,

71
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:12,725
I think it's more moral.

72
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,127
I think that a consent-based society

73
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:16,713
is a more moral society in economics.

74
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:17,546
A lot of folks on the left say,

75
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:18,613
well consent-based society won't get us

76
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:20,676
to universal healthcare, right.

77
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,372
So these are serious conversations

78
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:23,701
and serious discussions.

79
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,333
I think the way that we
can have a conversation

80
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,566
is actually by sitting and defining terms.

81
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,752
So very few conversations begin with the

82
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:30,085
defining of the terms, they sort of start

83
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:32,268
with second order conversations.

84
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:33,796
So instead of saying what do you want

85
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:34,772
healthcare to look like in America,

86
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,470
what are your competing rights and values?

87
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,049
Instead we start with,

88
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,572
we all want the same thing

89
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:41,556
and therefore nationalize healthcare.

90
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,700
Or we all want the same thing

91
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,636
and therefore complete privatization.

92
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:46,519
We might not actually want the same thing.

93
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,740
So you might want to start
with that discussion first.

94
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,638
What do you want to see?

95
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,255
So what I would like to
see in some of these areas

96
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,268
is more individual freedom

97
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:56,660
and then social networks
outside of government

98
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,493
picking up the slack.

99
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,993
That's what my ideal America looks like.

100
00:02:58,993 --> 00:02:59,826
For a lot of folks on the left,

101
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:00,659
they don't trust the social networks.

102
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:01,769
They think that the
government has to come in

103
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,761
and take care from the top-down.

104
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,572
These are fundamentally
different views of the country

105
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:09,633
and I'm not sure that they
are completely bridgeable.

106
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,913
We can have conversations about them,

107
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:12,908
but in the end I think the clarity

108
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:17,753
is sometimes preferable
to agreement in ambiguity.

109
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:18,802
- [Chanel] Well I appreciate
your time, thank you.

110
00:03:18,802 --> 00:00:00,000
- Thanks so much.
