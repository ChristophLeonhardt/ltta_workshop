when we open copper club last year mayor
I mean people were sitting on a terrace
every day I mean due to the amazing
views HMS Belfast Tower Bridge to shard
then as soon as God is if it got colder
we basically thought okay we have to
create a space where people can be
sitting outside all year long
we had some problems with them because
clearly you know the waiters or every
time they wanted to serve a table they
had to open the safe then thus it broke
we had to change the covers every other
week so operationally they were quite
difficult we then actually said this
year we're gonna do our own eat loss and
we designed those so much easier to
operate
