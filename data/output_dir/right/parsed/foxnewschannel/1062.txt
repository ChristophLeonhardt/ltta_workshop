>> Martha: SO A WOMAN IS NOW
BEHIND BARS FOR LYING ABOUT
RAPE.
19-YEAR-OLD NICKY OVINO
CLAIMED SHE WAS RAPED IN 2016
BY TWO SACRED HEART UNIVERSITY
FOOTBALL PLAYERS BUT SHE THEN
ADMITTED SHE WAS LYING.
UNFORTUNATELY, SO MUCH OF THE
DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.
JONATHAN HUNT IS LIVE IN THE
WEST COAST NEWSROOM WITH THE
BACK STORY.
HI, JONATHAN.
>> GOOD EVENING.
JURY SELECTION WAS ALREADY
UNDERWAY IN THIS CASE WHAT
WHICH HAS IRREVABLY CHANGED
THE LIVES.
THE ACCUSED WERE THE VICTIMS.
SHE CLAIMED TWO SACRED HEART
FOOTBALL PLAYERS PULLED HER IN
A BATHROOM AT A PARTY IN 2016
AND THEN TOOK TURNS RAPING
HER.
IN JANUARY HER LAWYER SAID SHE
WANTED CASE TRIED.
>> WE ARE READY TO GET A STORY
IN FRONT OF A JURY.
WE THINK THERE IS MORE TO THE
STORY THAN PORTRAYED IN THE
HEEDIA.
>> BUT THIS WEEK SHE ACCEPTED
A PLEA DEAL ADMITTING SHE MADE
UP THE ASSAULT ALLEGATION.
BECAUSE AS HER ARREST WARRANT
AFFIDAVIT STATED, "IT WAS THE
FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE
ANOTHER MALE STUDENT AS A
FRIEND AND POTENTIAL
BOYFRIEND."
THE AFFIDAVIT SAID SHE
BELIEVED WHEN THE OTHER
STUDENT, "HEARD THE
ALLEGATION, IT WOULD MAKE HIM
ANGRY AND SYMPATHETIC TO HER."
INVESTIGATORS SAID THE
FOOTBALL PLAYERS ADMITTED
HAVING SEX WITH HER BUT SAID
IT WAS CONSENSUAL.
THEIR ATTORNEY SAID THE PLEA
DEAL CANNOT MAKE UP FOR WHAT
SHE HAS PUT THE YOUNG MEN
THROUGH BUT THAT, "IT DOES
SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT
LYING ABOUT A SERIOUS INCIDENT
CARRIES SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES."
HER LAWYER SAID, "THIS WAS A
VERY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR
NICKY AND A SAD DAY FOR HER
AND HER FAMILY.
SHE WILL NOW BEGIN THE PROCESS
OF HEALING AND REHABILITATION
AS SHE AWAITS HER FINAL
SENTENCE."
UNDER THE PLEA BARGAIN, SHE
WILL BE FORMALLY SENTENCED
AUGUST 23 AND WILL SPEND ONE
YEAR IN PRISON.
>> Martha: REMARKABLE STORY.
WE HAVE THE LAWYER OF THE TWO
MEN WHO WERE FALSELY ACCUSED.
THEY ARE NOT NAMED.
ENOUGH DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE.
EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS KNOWS
ABOUT THEM.
WERE YOU SHOCKED SHE CAME
FORWARD?
YOU HAVE THE JURY AND YOU ARE
GOING TO TRIAL AND WHAT WAS
THE CATALYST?
>> SUDDENLY THE DAY CAME WHERE
I THINK SHE THOUGHT I'M GOING
TO SEE THE WHITES OF THE EYES
OF THIS JURY AND I JUST CAN'T
HANDLE IT.
IT WAS SURPRISED.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO
TRIAL.
I THOUGHT SHE WANTED TO
PRESENT HER STORY, HER
MULTIPLE STORIES TO A JURY AND
SHE CHANGED HER MIND.
>> Martha: THIS IS
EXTRAORDINARY.
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
NATIONWIDE #MeToo MOVEMENT
WHERE WE ARE TOLD ALL WOMEN
SHOULD BE BELIEVED.
THAT IS THE ENVIRONMENT WE
LIVE IN RIGHT NOW.
IS THERE ANYTHING -- WHAT ARE
THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT
POTENTIALLY?
>> WELL, THE #MeToo MOVEMENT
IS A POWERFUL MOVEMENT.
HOW MANY YEARS WOMEN FOUGHT TO
HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD.
THIS DOES A TREMENDOUS
DISSERVICE TO THAT.
THIS NOW CAUSES SOMEONE TO,
THEY ADMITTEDLY LIED AND NOW
IT DOES SOIL WHAT WOULD BE
OTHERWISE VALID ALLEGATIONS.
THE EVIDENCE ENDED UP PROVING
THERE WASN'T A SEXUAL ASSAULT.
SHE LIED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
FIRST CLAIMING A SEXUAL
ASSAULT.
THEN NOT.
THEN BEING ASSAULTED.
THEN NOT.
IT DOES A COMPLETE DISSERVICE.
>> Martha: I FEEL FOR HER AS
WELL.
OBVIOUSLY SHE HAS SOME ISSUES
SHE NEEDS TO WORK OUT.
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT
ON THE LIVES OF THE TWO YOUNG
MEN?
>> THEY ARE NO LONGER IN
SCHOOL.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE
OF THE SCHOOL ANYMORE.
THEY ARE IN THE WORKING WORLD
AND THEY ARE DOING THE BEST
THEY CAN.
THE ONE YEAR IN JAIL THAT SHE
IS SENTENCED TO PALES IN
COMPARISON TO THE 20 YEARS
THAT THE BOYS COULD HAVE
RECEIVED HAD THEY BEEN
ARRESTED AND HAD THEY BEEN
CONVICTED.
SO WHILE THE PUNISHMENT BY
SOME MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS
SEVERE, IT PALES IN COMPARISON
TO WHAT THE BOYS WERE FACING.
>> Martha: THEY CAN'T GO
BACK TO SCHOOL.
THEY CAN'T RESTART THEIR LIVES
WHERE THEY LEFT OFF.
>> THEY CAN.
THEY ARE CONSIDERING ALL OF
THEIR OPTIONS NOW.
THERE WILL BE A CIVIL SUIT
AGAINST NICKY MOST LIKELY AND
ALL THE OPTIONS ARE
CONSIDERED.
THEY ARE DOING AS WELL AS THEY
CAN RIGHT NOW.
>> Martha: AS YOU SAY, THESE
KIND OF ALLEGATIONS WHAT THEY
DO, THEY ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR
PEOPLE ACCUSED.
AND FOR ALL THE OTHER CASES
OUT THERE THAT ARE LEGITIMATE
#MeToo CASES WHERE THERE ARE
CASES OF ASSAULT.
IT MUDDIES THE WATER IN A
DANGEROUS WAY.
BUT IF YOU COME FORWARD WITH A
FALSE ALLEGATION YOU CAN END
UP IN JAIL.
>> YES, YOU CAN.
YOU CAN BE ARRESTED.
YOU CAN BE PUT IN JAIL AND YOU
CAN SUFFER CONSEQUENCES.
WHEN YOU LIE ABOUT A SERIOUS
INCIDENT IT CARRIES SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES.
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE.
>> Martha: THINK OF DUKE,
AND THERE ARE REASONS WHY
PEOPLE LIE ABOUT THE
SITUATIONS.
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY
SINGLE CASE INDIVIDUALLY ON
ITS MERITS.
BOTH PEOPLE INVOLVED, RIGHT?
AND REALLY GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF IT.
>> THE VICTIMS WHO ARE TRUE
VICTIMS, THEIR STORIES DON'T
CHANGE.
THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THEIR
