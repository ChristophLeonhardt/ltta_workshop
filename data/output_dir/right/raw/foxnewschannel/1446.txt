>> Sandra:  FORMER PRESIDENT

6
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,744
OBAMA GIVING HIMSELF A PAT ON

7
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,613
THE BACK CLAIMING HE DID NOT

8
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:12,880
HAVE ANY SCANDALS DURING HIS

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,682
EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE.

DIDN'T HAVE SCANDALS, WHICH

14
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:22,657
SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULDN'T BE

15
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:25,159
SOMETHING YOU BRAG ABOUT.

16
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,495
JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS

17
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,631

CAMPOS DUFFY.

19
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:32,232
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU AND YOUR

20
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,868
PARTY DISAGREE WITH THAT

21
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,402
STATEMENT, RACHEL.

22
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,970
>> THAT'S SO LAUGHABLE.

23
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,872
FIRST OF ALL WE'RE SITTING ON

24
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,674
THE MOTHER OF ALL SCANDALS

25
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:40,174
SPYGATE.

26
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,376
WHEN THIS ONION IS UNPEELED IT

27
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:44,946
WILL GO ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP

28
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,014
OF THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT,

29
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:47,281
VALERIE JARRETT AND BARACK

30
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:47,849
OBAMA HIMSELF.

31
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:49,117
THEY WILL GET THERE IF THE

32
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:51,319
PRESS LETS US DO THAT IN

33
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:51,686
REALTIME.

34
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:54,455
THE OBAMA LEGACY IS ONE OF

35
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,624
USING THE TOOLS OF GOVERNMENT

36
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:57,558
TO RUTHLESSLY TAKE DOWN

37
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:57,925
OPPONENTS.

38
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:04,265
THAT'S WHAT HE DID I.R.S.

39
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:04,732
SCANDAL.

40
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,367
HE USED THE D.O.J. AND F.B.I.

41
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,370
BY THE WAY, TO GO AFTER DONALD

42
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:09,671
TRUMP.

43
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,005
THOSE THREE INSTITUTIONS HAS

44
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:11,973
DESTROYED THE CREDIBILITY OF

45
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,608
THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS A

46
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:14,742
SCANDAL IN AND OF ITSELF.

47
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,012
WE CAN GO TO FAST AND FURIOUS.

48
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,148
IMAGINE IF DONALD TRUMP HAD

49
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:21,783
SOLD WEAPONS TO MEXICAN DRUG

50
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:23,651
LORDS AND THOSE WEAPONS WERE

51
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,286
USED TO KILL INNOCENT MEXICANS

52
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,155
AND OUR OWN BORDER PATROL.

53
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,490
THE FACT THAT THE PRESS OR THE

54
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,359
MAINSTREAM LIBERAL PRESS HAS

55
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,860
NOT REPORTED ON IT DOESN'T --

56
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,395
WITH THE SERIOUSNESS THAT IT

57
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,897
DESERVES DOESN'T MEAN THAT

58
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:37,198
THESE AREN'T SERIOUS SCANDALS.

59
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:42,170
>> Sandra:  SHE IS POINTING OUT

60
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,837
IRS.

61
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,939
FAST AND FURIOUS, BENGHAZI.

62
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,041
>> I'M LISTENING WITH A SMILE.

63
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,811
IT SEEMS TO ME AMUSING.

64
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:51,045
WHAT A DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE OF

65
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:51,913
SCANDAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

66
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:55,049
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT IN OFFICE

67
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,151
WHO WAS REVEALED TO BE -- HAVE

68
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,786
KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE LIED ABOUT

69
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,955
SECRETLY PAYING MONEY TO A PORN

70
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:01,255
STAR.

71
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,324
>> Sandra:  HOLD ON.

72
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,959
OBAMA SAYS HE HAD NO SCANDALS

73
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,327
WHILE IN OFFICE.

74
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,295
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

75
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,663
WHO IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

76
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,466
WAS INDICTED AND WENT TO JAIL?

77
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,267
I DON'T THINK THAT HAPPENED.

78
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,436
I JUST THINK THAT, IN FACT, HE

79
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:20,942
WAS AN EXAMPLE OF SORT OF THE

80
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:24,412
FLAWED EXAMPLE OF CONSTANT

81
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,047
INVESTIGATIONS BY GOP INTO

82
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:31,686
BENGHAZI AND FAST AND FURIOUS.

83
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:34,555
ERIC HOLDER WAS HELD IN

84
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,289
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.

85
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,657
NOBODY WAS SENT TO JAIL.

86
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,825
NO FINDINGS.

87
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,961
>> THE ONLY ATTORNEY GENERAL

88
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:41,963
MEMBER OF ANY CABINET EVER HELD

89
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:43,831
IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS IS ERIC

90
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,100
HOLDER BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO

91
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,401
COOPERATE WITH CONGRESS IN

92
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,903
INVESTIGATING FAST AND FURIOUS.

93
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,304
WHAT ABOUT --

94
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,706
>> THEY KEPT BADGERING HIM.

95
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:52,840
>> Sandra:  LET ME TELL YOU

96
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,108
WHERE THE BAR IS.

97
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,743
HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT --

98
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:56,511
THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAID, JUAN.

99
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,414
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

100
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,016
THE MODERN PRESIDENCY, COMING

101
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,417
OUT OF THE MODERN PRESIDENCY

102
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,052
WITHOUT ANYBODY GOING TO JAIL

103
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:05,620
IS REALLY GOOD.

104
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,890
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

105
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,259
IS THAT WHERE THE BAR IS?

106
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,260
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

107
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,931
WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE MUELLER

108
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,965
INVESTIGATION INDICTMENTS OF

109
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,066
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST

110
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:19,734
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.

111
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,570
WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THE OBAMA

112
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,037
ADMINISTRATION.

113
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,906
IF YOU WANT TO COMPARE.

114
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,274
WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI, WHAT ABOUT

115
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,441
FAST AND FURIOUS?

116
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,744
IF YOU CAN'T TO TALK ABOUT

117
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:34,048
SCOTT PRUITT OR THE EVENTS IN

118
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,516
NIGER WHERE WE LOST FOUR MEN.

119
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,084
NOT THE SAME LEVEL.

120
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,719
>> Sandra:  HE BROUGHT THIS UP

121
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,887
HIMSELF AND WHY WE'RE TALKING

122
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,354
ABOUT IT.

123
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,423
HE IS PATTING HIMSELF ON THE

124
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,825
BACK EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT A

125
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,459
SCANDAL AND WENT ON TO SAY NO

126
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,128
ONE IN MY WHITE HOUSE GOT IN

127
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,696
TROUBLE FOR SCREWING UP.

128
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,065
AS LONG AS THERE WASN'T

129
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,233
MALICIOUS INTENT BEHIND IT,

130
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:52,567
RACHEL.

131
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,837
>> Sandra:  IT'S RIDICULOUS.

132
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,405
HE KNEW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S

133
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,307
SERVER AND EMAILED HER ON IT

134
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,209
AND HE HAD HIS A.G. WORK TO

135
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,010
CALL IT JUST A MATTER AND HE

136
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,245
HAD A COMPLIANT PRESS.

137
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,515
WE HAD A PRESS WHO KNEW THAT

138
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,083
BARACK OBAMA SPIED ON

139
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,585
JOURNALISTS AND THE JOURNALISTS

140
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:11,752
IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DIDN'T

141
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,387
IS SEEM TO CARE ABOUT IT.

142
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,489
I THINK SPYGATE IS THE MOTHER

143
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,190
OF ALL SCANDALS.

144
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,391
WHEN THIS COMES DOWN AND WHEN

145
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,726
WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT

146
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,562
MAYBE WE'LL HEAR IN REALTIME BY

147
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,296
THE JOURNALISTS NOW.

148
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,365
IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS

149
00:04:24,365 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WORST SCANDAL EVER.
