00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,450
directly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for my webcam and</font>

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,160
you know how when you go somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,700
eat out you eat right before you leave

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,940
like that it doesn't make no sense but

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,730
hold on I just got overwhelmingly hungry

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,180
right before I'm about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go eat so huh</font>

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,390
just want to show you guys one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,090
reasons why I don't do twist outs

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,430
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think my hair can't</font>

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really withstand that this is a Twitter</font>

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,200
this is a twist out you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it's what I don't know if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but I thought twists split up twist</font>

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,770
outs are supposed to stand up like a fro

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,739
except larger all this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> did was</font>

17
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,920
crinkle my hair and now I look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,190
two-year-old so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you can</font>

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:13,070
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like that just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all over and</font>

20
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,780
like here it's straight you know I'm

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,790
saying like it's straight so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,950
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens every time I do try and do</font>

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,150
twists or twist out my hair ends up

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:34,460
being straighter and not thick at all so

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,930

reasons why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do not attempt said style</font>
