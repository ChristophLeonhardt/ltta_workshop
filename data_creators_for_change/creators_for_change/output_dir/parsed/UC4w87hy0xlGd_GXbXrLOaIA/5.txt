you they also the most painful
experience is happening right now all my
friends buddy fingers friends are
watching my youtube channel in front of
me and I have one rule and that rule is
you can't watch my videos in front of me
because I'm a greedy embarrass and I get
very embarrassed that's all right well
the only reason to be honest that they
want to watch the videos because of this
they love her they love her
they love me so one thing I love about
this country is that people hang out
throughout the night and majority of
those hangouts happen at these places
called marks and it's literally like an
all-night cafe where people come and eat
good food and good drinks and the best
thing about them it doesn't matter how
rich you are how poor you are you come
everyone together and you hang out at
this place that is accessible to
everybody I'm gonna take you guys with
me today because something entertaining
always happens with my group of friends
and when we're together
so you'll enjoy it
it's just he's on the ball he always
smiling I think that the tool for the
place where everyone come and chill and
just good vibes and keys where it's
better oh okay I'm just taking a timeout
I'm hanging out with my friends and you
know become it every night we have a
great time and we all hang out and it's
always awesome because of the
hospitality of the people that look
after us especially Sean but it just
occurred to me that I I know nothing
about him and someone who serves me
every day and so nice and we have a good
chat and everything but I know so little
about him like Mitchy nothing so I
thought you know why not why not try to
get to know him a little bit better so

difficult life is or
I might think that I've got it really
hard for the meeting someone like so
hard has made me realize

have every reason to be down to be angry
to be upset with the way that their life
is going but they they persevere and
they are strong
and they do the right thing I'm so
grateful for meeting someone like show

lesson so you know I'm not wealthy in
fact every day I hustle in my own way I
feel like at this juncture where then he

of like YouTube channel and a company
that spending it on the things that
matter most in the beginning it will set
a precedent for how the channel goes in
the future so I've taken out a month of
his salary it's for his family and hope
he will just help
I feel inspired I feel motivated and I'm
so grateful to have met someone like so
