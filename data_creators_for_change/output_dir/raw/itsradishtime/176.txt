00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be pretty dope if</font>

7
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,920
everybody in this world or bilingual I

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,480
mean there's lots of good reasons why

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">you should learn a second language for</font>

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">one it makes it smarter because</font>

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,320
switching back and forth between two

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,750
systems language actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes your</font>

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,000
brain better at multitasking it makes

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,439
your memory better it makes you better

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,600
at listening comprehension bilingual

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">adults are also less likely to suffer</font>

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Alzheimer's and dementia also if</font>

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">your native English speaker it makes an</font>

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,899
English better because when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,730
about the structures of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages</font>

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,950
and how all of their pieces get put

22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,500
together it makes you more aware of your

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">own language and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I think the</font>

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,180
most important part is that learning

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,039
another language makes you a better

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,230
person learning a new language allows

27
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,329
you to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

28
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,520
people you otherwise never<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it allows you to</font>

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,970
travel to places you might otherwise be

31
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,210
too afraid to go it exposes you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> music</font>

32
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,979
movies books and art you otherwise

33
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,320
wouldn't be able to understand and it

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,869
also looks really good on a job

35
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,100
application and the craziest thing is by

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,110
learning a second language you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start</font>

37
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to understand ideas and emotions and</font>

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,509
concepts your language might not even

39
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,670
have a word for learning another

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,950
language really gives you an entirely

41
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,829
new perspective on life I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ray</font>

42
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,710
but I double majored in English and

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,659
Spanish and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kyle</font>

44
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:42,079
and learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of that spanish really</font>

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,880
kind of changed my life which makes me

46
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,499
especially scared of what's happening

47
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:47,390
now I've been out of college for a

48
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,520
little over a year now and that means

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's been about a year since i've</font>

50
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">been using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spanish regularly when you</font>

51
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,350
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it you lose it it's been</font>

52
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,030
happening for long enough now that I'm

53
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,090
actually afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to practice my Spanish</font>

54
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,789
in the limited circumstances that i can

55
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,069
because i'm too insecure and afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

56
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:09,649
making terrible mistakes that's really

57
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best way or kind of the only way to</font>

58
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:14,030
learn and maintain a language it's to

59
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,819
practice it constantly and talk at

60
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,010
people and have them talk back at you

61
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,560
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get like a basic level of</font>

62
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,660
confidence back so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got that duolingo</font>

65
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:35,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">gothic the randomness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if you</font>
