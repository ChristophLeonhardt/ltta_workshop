1
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:11,340
>>> WELCOME BACK.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,043
WELL A NEW POLL REVEALING

3
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:15,711
AMERICANS ARE BECOMING MORE

4
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:16,378
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NORTH KOREA

5
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:18,614
GIVING UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

6
00:00:18,614 --> 00:00:20,082
FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S

7
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:20,916
SUMMIT.

8
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,818
LAST WEEK 41% NOW SAY IT'S

9
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:24,820
LIKELY UP FROM 30% IN APRIL.

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,822
>> HERE TO REACT, FORMER

11
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,124
GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS AND FOX

12
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:31,760
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MIKE HUCKABEE.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,996
HAPPY FATHER'S DAY.

14
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:35,564
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:37,166
PLEASE TELL YOUR DAD HAPPY

16
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,667
FATHER'S DAY FROM AN OLD FRIEND,

17
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:39,502
AND I MEAN OLD FRIEND.

18
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:40,136
>> I WILL.

19
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,303
YOU BOTH ARE GREAT MEN.

20
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:42,938
BOTH OF YOUR DAUGHTERS, MYSELF

21
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:45,741
AND YOURS ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU

22
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:46,909
IN OUR LIVES.

23
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,344
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE

24
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:49,411
WAY THE COUNTRY IS FEELING ABOUT

25
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:49,979
NORTH KOREA.

26
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,081
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A DISCONNECT

27
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:53,382
BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IN

28
00:00:53,382 --> 00:00:55,784
THE MEDIA AND HOW MUCH OF

29
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:58,020
AMERICA FEELS AND HOW OPTIMISTIC

30
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,255
THEY ARE ABOUT MOVING FORWARD

31
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:00,089
AND DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA.

32
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,591
YOU LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS.

33
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:04,527
PEOPLE SEEM LIKE WE'RE IN A GOOD

34
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:06,195
PLACE RIGHT NOW HOPING FOR THE

35
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:06,495
BEST.

36
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:08,164
>> WELL IT'S CERTAINLY MOVING IN

37
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:08,764
THAT DIRECTION.

38
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:11,567
AND I THINK THE FACT IS PEOPLE

39
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,870
SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN NORTH

40
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,171
KOREA.

41
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:19,508
THEY SAW THE DIFFERENCE OF KIM K

42
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:20,576
THEY SAW THE DIFFERENCE OF KIM M

43
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:21,443
JONG-UN'S ATTITUDE OF STOPPING

44
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:23,112
THE TESTS THAT HAD BEEN GOING

45
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:23,779
ON.

46
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,949
AND THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT WAS

47
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:28,284
HISTORIC IN THAT IT BROUGHT THE

48
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:28,984
TWO SIDES TOGETHER.

49
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,619
I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.

50
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,388
NORTH KOREA IS NOT GOING TO HAVE

51
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:33,689
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FUTURE.

52
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,890
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM UP

53
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,792
ONE OR TWO WAYS.

54
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:40,029
THEY'RE E VERY GOING TO

55
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:45,601
VOLUNTEERLY

56
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:45,634
VOLUNTARRLY

57
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,136
VOLUNTARILY GIVE THEM UP OR

58
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:48,504
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM TAKEN

59
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:48,804
AWAY.

60
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:50,272
I BELIEVE THEY DO UNDERSTAND,

61
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:51,807
DONALD TRUMP IS NOT BARACK

62
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,442
OBAMA, GEORGE BUSH OR BILL

63
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:53,776
CLINTON.

64
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,744
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO JUST SAY,

65
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,413
OKAY, WE MADE A DEAL, YOU DIDN'T

66
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:58,514
KEEP IT.

67
00:01:58,514 --> 00:01:59,348
NOTHING HAPPENS.

68
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:01,116
I THINK SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN

69
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:04,320
AND KIM JONG-UN UNDERSTANDS THAT

70
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,121
IF HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO BE

71
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,356
THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA, HE

72
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:08,924
GIVES UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

73
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:10,359
IF HE DOESN'T GIVE THEM UP,

74
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:11,727
THEY'LL BE TAKEN FROM HIM AND IT

75
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,762
WILL NOT BE PRETTY.

76
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:15,431
>> GOVERNOR, ANY CONCERN THAT

77
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,365
THE ADMINISTRATION IS GETTING

78
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,467
AHEAD OF ITSELF, THAT THEY

79
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,835
HAVEN'T -- YOU KNOW, TAKE THE

80
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,438
STEPS TO DENUCLEARIZE, THE

81
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:23,739
RHETORIC IS SAYING HEY THEY'RE

82
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,341
GOING TO.

83
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:27,476
ANY CONCERN THERE OR ARE THE

84
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,344
LEADERS STRONG ENOUGH THEY'LL

85
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:31,146
MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW

86
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:31,480
THROUGH?

87
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,650
>> I'VE SEAN DONALD

88
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:34,683
>> I'VE SAIN DONALD

89
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:34,950
>> I'VE SAID DONALD

90
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:34,984
>> I'VE SAID TONALD

91
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:35,017
>> I'VE SAID THAALD

92
00:02:35,017 --> 00:02:35,050
>> I'VE SAID THATLD

93
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,018
>> I'VE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP

94
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:39,655
HAS PLAYED THIS DIFFERENTLY THAN

95
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:40,389
ANYONE ELSE.

96
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,290
HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE.

97
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,625
HIS IS SO FAR WORKING BETTER

98
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,960
THAN ALL OF THE CONVENTIONAL AND

99
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,195
TRADITIONAL APPROACHES.

100
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:47,730
LET'S LET THIS PLAY OUT.

101
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,598
AND HE HAS PROVEN TIME AND AGAIN

102
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:51,767
TO BE RIGHT WHEN EVERYONE, EVEN

103
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,302
THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM THOUGHT HE

104
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:53,769
WAS WRONG.

105
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,139
SO ONE THING WE ARE SEEING IS

106
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,008
THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DECIDED TO

107
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:01,377
THROW CONVENTION OUT THE WINDOW,

108
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:03,078
NOT JUST DO THE THINGS THAT HAVE

109
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:05,514
ALWAYS BEEN DONE, WHICH HAVE

110
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:08,350
BEEN INE TECH

111
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,417
BEEN INEFFECH

112
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:08,717
BEEN INEFFECTIVE.

113
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:13,222
WHICH THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF

114
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:13,589
INSANITY.

115
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:14,857
>> HAVE YOU HEARD FROM A

116
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:16,091
PARTICULAR PRESS SECRETARY OF

117
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,793
THIS FATHER'S DAY?

118
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:22,798
>> I'M SURE I WILL, BUT I'M

119
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:24,033
GUESSING -- LET ME PUT IT THIS

120
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:24,300
WAY.

121
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,535
NOW THAT I'M SHAMING HER ON

122
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:28,370
NATIONAL TELEVISION, I'M PRETTY

123
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,838
SURE I WILL HEAR FROM HER AT

124
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:30,239
SOME POINT.

125
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,273
>> IT'S EARLY.

126
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:32,574
WE'LL GIVE HER A MULLIGAN ON

127
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:33,242
THAT ONE.

128
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:34,777
>> I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE HER A

129
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:36,879
LITTLE LIT OF SLACK.

130
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,714
BUT IF I DON'T HEAR FROM HER IN

131
00:03:38,714 --> 00:00:00,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS I'LL BE
