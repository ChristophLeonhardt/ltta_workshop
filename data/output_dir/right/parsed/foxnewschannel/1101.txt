IRAN A SPECIFIC LICENSE TO ALLOW
THEM TO TAKE SOME OF THE FUNDS.
THEY DID SO BECAUSE THEY WERE
DESPERATE TO GET A DEAL.
ROB: NEW DEVELOPMENT ON IRAN.
GOP LAWMAKERS ACCUSING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION DELIBERATELY
MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
BY GIVING IRAN OR ATTEMPTING TO
GIVE IRAN ACCESS TO THE US
FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN ITS
DESPERATION TO GET THE IRAN
NUCLEAR DEAL DONE.
>> BERRY ABOUT HER MILK SERVES
AS AN INTEL SPECIALIST IN THE
AIR FORCE.
HE JOINS US TO REACT.
ON THE ONE HAND THE FORMER STATE
DEPARTMENT COURT MADE A FOR THE
IRAN DEAL SAYING THIS IS WIDELY
OVERBLOWN.
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HEARD THE
SAME THING WE HEARD A MINUTE AGO
IN AN INTERVIEW.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS?
>> IRONIC YOU HAD THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION IN 2007 CRITICIZE
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY SAYING
TOO MANY DEALS WERE DONE BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS DONE BY THE STROKE
OF THE PRES.'S PLAN WITHOUT
ENGAGING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
GOING BEHIND THE HALLS OF
CONGRESS BUT THAT WAS DONE HE
REPEATEDLY.
THE ADMINISTRATION REPORTED TO
CONGRESS THEY WOULD HAVE NO
ACCESS TO AMERICAN FINANCIAL
SYSTEM BUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN THEY
ARE GIVING LICENSE AWAY.
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THE LEVEL OF
NON-TRANSPARENCY WE ARE SEEING
NOW THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.
ROB: THIS ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET
DONE.
THE ADMINISTRATION TOLD A COUPLE
BANKS DO THIS.
THE PRES. AND THE WHITE HOUSE
SAYING DO THIS, THESE BANKS WERE
SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THIS SHOULD
BE DONE.
EVEN WITH THE WHITE HOUSE GIVING
THEM THE APPROVAL.
>> AND OF PATRIOTISM IN THIS
COUNTRY WITH OUR BANKS, OUR
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
RIGHT AND WRONG, THEY UNDERSTAND
PRES. RONNIE --ROUHANI THEY HATE
ISRAEL, THEY HIT THE UNITED
STATES, REFER TO US AS THE GREAT
SATAN.
I SERVE A SPECIAL TASK FORCE
TRACKING TERRORIST TRAVEL ON
HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND
WE UNCOVERED SO MUCH OF WHAT
IRAN IS DOING SUPPORTING HAMAS
AND HEZBOLLAH, BRINGING
TERRORISTS INTO THE MIDDLE EAST
IN THE UNITED STATES AND YET
THIS MONEY THAT SUPPOSEDLY
SANCTION THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT
WAS HELPING GET INTO THE HANDS
OF URANIAN'S WHICH IS IN THE
HANDS OF TERRORISTS.
>> YOU WANT TO ASK WHY THIS IS
STILL SO CONTROVERSIAL YEARS
LATER BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE
GET MORE INFORMATION AND LEARN
MORE YOU GET YOUR ANSWER TO
THAT.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THIS
HANDLED ALL ALONG?
>> THIS ENTIRE DEAL SHOULD HAVE
DONE CONGRESS.
THE REASON THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
DO THAT IS HE KNOWS CONGRESS
WOULD NOT APPROVE A DEAL LIKE
THIS THAT EMPOWERS THE GREATEST
ENEMIES, THE ENEMY THAT
THREATENED TO DESTROY THE UNITED
STATES, AND THE DEAL WAS SO
LOPSIDED IN THEIR FAVOR.
PEOPLE WENT AS FAR AS SECRETLY
PROVIDING $1.7 BILLION IN
AMERICAN CASH.
THIS MONEY WENT STRAIGHT INTO
INCREASING MILITARY AND
SUPPORTING TERRORISTS.
THIS SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A
TREATY THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
AND THAT IS NOT WHY THE
PRESIDENT WENT THE ROUTE.
>> DEMOCRATS SAY THIS IS THEIR
WAY OF PREVENTING IRAN FROM
GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
CONSERVATIVES DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT
THIS DEAL.
WAS DUMPED INTO THE COUNTRY, AND
MORE IRANS IN THE WORLD, TALK
ABOUT A BAD DECISION FOR THE
FUTURE, MAYBE IN THE SHORT-TERM,
CREATED A MESS.
>> THE SANCTIONS WE AGREED TO.
THE MONEY THEY RECEIVED,
ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES,
STRENGTHENING THE MILITARY, A
ROGUE REGIME HATES THE UNITED
STATES, HATE EVERYTHING WE STAND
FOR AND THEY WILL VIOLATE
DEVELOP WEAPONS AND AS PART OF
THE AGREEMENT THEY BANNED US
ACCESS TO THEIR MILITARY
INSTALLATIONS, TO DEVELOP
NUCLEAR WEAPON
INSTALLATIONS, TO DEVELOP
NUCLEAR WEAPON MOVING TO
MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, AND THE
PHILOSOPHY OF LEADING FROM
