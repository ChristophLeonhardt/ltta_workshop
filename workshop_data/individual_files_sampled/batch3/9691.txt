Shannon: GARRETT, THINK OF HER MUCH. PRO-LIFE GROUP GETS THEIR WAY PLANNED PARENTHOOD WILL HAVE A WHOLE NEW FUNDING PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS. PRESSURE TO A DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDS AWAY FROM CLINICS THAT DO ABORTIONS IN FAVOR OF QUALIFIED HEALTH CLINICS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE BUT DO NOT PERFORM ABORTIONS. LET'S DISCUSS WITH THE PANEL. PENNY NANCE, DR. RONNIE FLOYD, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. IT'S COMING UP TOMORROW. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. THIS ISSUE THAT GARRETT TOUCHED ON, THERE ARE A LOT WHO ARE UNHAPPY THAT NOT ONLY DID REPUBLICANS VOTE TO PASS THIS BILL THAT STILL CONTAINS FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED IT. IT CAME UP LAST NIGHT IN THE WEST VIRGINIA DEBATE. HERE'S WHAT THE INTERCHANGE WAS. PLANNED PARENTHOOD A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS VOTES, KILLING THE UNBORN. Shannon: PENNY, I KNOW YOU ARE HEARING AND EARFUL FROM A BASE THAT'S NOT HAPPY. ACTUALLY WHEN THE VOTE HAPPENED, MY PHONE WAS BURNING UP EVEN ON VACATION. THIS IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT AND RECENT HISTORY, NOT JUST THAT. THIS IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE WHITE HOUSE STAFF IN RECENT HISTORY. HE HAS DONE A LOT TOWARDS THAT ISSUE, BUT WE'VE STILL GOT FARTHER TO GO ON THIS. AT THIS POINT, THERE ARE STILL WITHIN THE REGULATION CLINTON ERA REGULATIONS THAT SAY IN ORDER TO PRESENT PARTICIPATE, Shannon: TAXPAYER MONEY. $206 MILLION YEAR FROM TAXPAYER MONEY THAT GOES TO 4,000 HEALTH CLINICS, TITLE X CLINICS. ONLY 500 OF THOSE ARE PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICS. WHAT WE HAVE CITED LET'S GO BACK TO THE REAGAN ERA REGULATION THAT WAS AFFIRMED BY THE SUPREME COURT. IT'S LEGAL. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ENTANGLE TAXPAYER MONEY WITH ABORTION. IF YOU ARE GOING TO ACCEPT THIS MONEY, YOU CAN'T BE LOCATED, COLOCATED IN AN ABORTION CLINIC. AND YOU CAN'T REFER AN COUNCIL FOR ABORTIONS. STEWART PLANNED PARENTHOOD SAY IT WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES AND DISMANTLE THE NATION'S PROGRAM FOR AFFORDABLE BIRTH CONTROL AND RE-PRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WHICH 4 MILLION PEOPLE RELY ON. THE POLICY IS DANGEROUS. IT WOULD KEEP WOMEN FOR HAVING INFORMATION FROM GETTING THE BEST HEALTH CARE POSSIBLE. THIS IS THE GROUP THAT HELD UP AS HE CUT FUNDING FOR CARE FOR PEOPLE IMPORT RICOH BECAUSE THEY WANTED A PIECE OF THE ACTION. THIS IS THE ABORTION MAFIA. THEY WANT ALL THE MONEY FOR THEMSELVES. THEY ARE ABORTION BUSINESS MODEL HAS GROWN WHILE ABORTION HAS GONE DOWN AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT MORE FOR THEM. THIS REGULATION AND THE CHANGE IN THE REGULATION WERE PROPOSING, IT OPENS THE DOOR FOR MORE PEOPLE TO COMPETE. FAITH-BASED GROUPS TO COMPETE AND CARE FOR POOR WOMEN. PLUS WE SAID SWITCH FUNDING TO THE 13,000 COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THAT ACTUALLY DO CARE FOR PER POOR WOMEN BUT DON'T FOR PER POOR WOMEN BUT DON'D FOR PER POOR WOMEN BUT DON'O ABORTIONS. Shannon: YOU SAY AMERICA NEEDS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. WE DO. IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES IN THE HEARTS OF ALL EVANGELICALS AND CONSERVATIVES. WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH THIS ISSUE. IN FACT, TOMORROW IS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF GATHERINGS FOR THE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. MANY OF THOSE GATHERINGS WILL FOCUS IN ON MATTERS OF CONCERN ABOUT THE CULTURE AND ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE SANCTITY AND DIGNITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND TO PRAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. Shannon: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO WOULD SAY THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION WE SHOULD BE HAVING. THIS OF ADMINISTRATION SHOULD NOT BE IMPOSING WHAT THEY THE AS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERAL MONEY AND ACCESS TO THINKING OF THE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER TOMORROW, AMERICANS UNITED FOR SEPARATION OF STATE, CHURCH AND STATE SAY IT'S A VEHICLE FOR SPREADING RELIGIOUS MISS INFORMATION AND FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. THE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER MOBILIZES, UNIFIED PUBLIC PRAYER FOR AMERICA. WE CAN CALL OUT TO GOD AND TALK TO GOD ABOUT AMERICA. ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN REALLY JUST REALLY CONVICTED OF IS THAT PRAYER CROSSES ALL THE AISLES. I MEAN, PRAYER IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS. PRAYER IS THAT SOMETHING WE CAN DO TOGETHER BECAUSE WE CAN GO TO GOD ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE ABOUT ANYTHING. TOMORROW IS A DAY WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO GO TO GOD ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND PRAY FOR OUR COUNTRY AND ITS FUTURE. Shannon: MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE DAY IS ITS SPORADIC COSTS SPREAD ACROSS ANY
