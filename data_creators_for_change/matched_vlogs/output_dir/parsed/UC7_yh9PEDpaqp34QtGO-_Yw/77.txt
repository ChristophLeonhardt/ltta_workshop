really know what my mom and dad and
Jordan if I know what I eat I know what
you eat that but I don't really see mom
eating we've been shopping with this up
quite a few times Jana see the trolley
line only wandering around a bit
on the toy aisles so yeah I'm really
really really excited
how'd you feel mother you good Oh er no
basically you've gotta beit's or you try
and think of all the things what you've
seen us you know in ours grow through
the foods and see if you can manage
again enough to last us a week basically
yeah that's true Island do you know
Bobby anyway this I've been keeping a
close eye on YouTube there any clues I
will say to you right now is make sure
you don't over the expensive things for
sometimes you get the same thing
cheaper yes I use your you know
imagination so number look and check
things out properly okay alright first
thing I'm going to ask you - how'd you
get your trolleys not on the big
trolleys but on the smaller ones you'd
have to pound him yeah so
there you go well Delilah nothing
nothing nothing nothing let's go
so we're going you and that's though
that look at me your shopping
okay let's go there
I really do lock my Bernard especially
before I go to the gym yeah that's good
yeah morning mom does like cucumbers
Maddie ice cream
exactly mum likes to make those salads
all done
what did you say ILO yes she does like
tomatoes
why have you got there Tiana watermelon
okay
interesting
there's a big bag of carrots I learned
if we're gonna have that that many
carrots
what is that
Oh
which one I have smarter sauce
and it goes we need to kind of think
about
I don't think I've seen him I haven't
shown up check any prices at bar
just putting shopping in the back but
you looking out and talking while you're
looking at we live it up
Oh
well-spotted CR now do you like those
but you do say Allah I love cheese
I think it's called Cathedral the cheese
I like
so what have you got there Tiana some
fried chicken chicken nuggets yeah
Oh
What did he say I love what's the price
of that four pounds not interested about
the price okay okay what do you think
that's value for money then Tiana you
think so that's goodbye you make the
decision yeah okay you're shopping
you're shopping
the burgers so basically yeah you need
the bun so the burgers and they're not
frozen obviously so you got to think of
that so what you think
right hold on Tiana so which bacon do
you normally see in the house
the one with the mold on either unsmoked
or smote so I don't think it's here Stan
this ayah
see I know what do I normally have a lot
of meat and right so have you seen the
new chicken have you seen the new
chicken I'll bet you pass the chicken
there
complete March again
so that is the only tip I think I'm
gonna give you because you cannot leave
my chicken
okay yes we have that a lot you
discussed the tomatoes at top corner
he spots the strawberries
very
you're right where's your mom okay we're
in the video you know Gianna really
we're okay it's Jana
I didn't tell you this I've got some of
your toys in my bag gonna give this girl
one of your toys yeah you'll see them

gonna give me one now so it's basically
my pop mega pop box so you have to
squeeze it and then confetti comes out
on this two surprises inside all right
you're welcome keep watching okay well
done either well we're done keep going
ball done that's good that's good
impressive yeah
what's the RO a lot okay so let's see
which one you go for what do you think
to the sides of the aisle are too big a
I'll fix up a school choice Moscato
of the spicy
but not these chickens then
what do you think
so I know you've mentioned to me only
one a type of bacon unsmoked is fine
that one is some a lot cheaper for pound
that's back bacon don't forget you got
to read the packaging does it say
unsmoked we look at the over package ins
the one I like is smoked or unsmoked
yeah that will do that was best good one
for girls that's it okay
so you can you remember what type of
books of what we normally have yes but
you remember it's the golden cubes
they're not in those tops I think you'll
see them on another aisle so there's
more butter here let me see if you can
recognize it when we come across it oh
all nearly nearly is but it's right
there that's the one yeah that's the one
yeah
