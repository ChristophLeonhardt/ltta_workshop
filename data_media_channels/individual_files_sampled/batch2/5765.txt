and thanks to at home for joining us this hour one of the perks that comes with being President of the United States is that you get the use of a very nice supposedly rustic retreat called Camp David it's in the woods it's up in the mountains in Maryland it is technically a US military facility but what it really is is the official country residence of the President of the United States and Camp David isn't just one house it isn't like one single living facility it's a whole bunch of different buildings a bunch of different cabins or lodges and they're all named for different trees and shrubs there's red oak and Hawthorne and witch hazel and the Hickory Lodge there's a presidential office and a whole bunch of conference and meeting rooms at a place called Laurel Lodge which was built during the Nixon administration in the early 70s but but the main presidential cabin up at Camp David is called Aspen and if you do a google image search for it you'll find there are all sorts of great pictures going back decades of presidents enjoying the Aspen Lodge at Camp David in all sorts of different ways or important meetings and stuff but also just kicking back so there's like I could maybe playing Scrabble at the Aspen Lodge there's Truman driving up and his convertible to the Aspen Lodge there's Gerald Ford being actually as adorable as I've ever seen him in plaid pants at the Aspen Lodge there's George W Bush getting to know a lot of Mir Putin there's President Obama apparently losing a water gun fight with his then young daughters all at the Aspen Lodge at Camp David and the reason it's helpful to know that detail about the presidential cabin and the different names for different things at Camp David is because when people are writing about presidential history it can sometimes be a little bit confusing when people who've been at the high levels of a presidential administration people who have worked at the White House say offhandedly that the president did something at Aspen for the rest of us that would usually make us think that the president had done something in Colorado Aspen Colorado but if somebody who's working in a White House says that what they usually mean is actually the president was at the Aspen Lodge was that the presidential residence at Camp David that's what they mean when they say a president was at Aspen and lots of important things lots of important meetings have have happened there Bob Haldeman HR Haldeman went by Bob he was Richard Nixon's chief of staff through the spring of 1973 true Nixon loyalists he had run one of Nixon's campaign campaigns for governor of California he had been chief of staff for the 1968 nixon presidential campaign and then he became White House chief of staff when Nixon was sworn in all through Nixon's first term in office and through the 1972 re-election campaign HR Haldeman Bob Haldeman was Nixon's chief of staff which means that Haldeman was up to his neck and Beyond in Watergate the the 18 and a half minute gap of the mysteriously erased tape from Watergate that was tape of Nixon talking about something we'll never know with Bob Haldeman also the smoking gun tape the tape that caused even Pro Nixon Republicans in Congress to give up and turn against him the smoking gun tape that actually started the impeachment process rolling inexorably toward Nixon that smoking gun tape that really more than anything was the proximate cause of forcing Nixon from office that smoking gun tape where where Nixon is heard on tape ordering the CIA to tell the FBI that the FBI needed to stay out of the Watergate investigation the guy who Nixon gave that order to on that smoking gun tape his Haldeman although all the worst stuff all the most incriminating stuff all the stuff we remember all these years later it was all Haldeman was right there for all of it it was right in the mix of all of the worst of it now Nixon didn't resign until August 1974 publicly right up till the very end he insisted he wouldn't go there was no need for him to go he'd be vindicated but privately we now know that more than a year before he actually resigned resigned August of 74 in April of 73 we now know President Nixon told his chief of staff he told Bob Haldeman that he was going to resign sixteen months before Nixon actually did resign Nixon told Haldeman privately that he was despondent he actually told Haldeman that he thought he was going to die he told Haldeman that he was going to quit as president he said he had to quit because he said that he Richard Nixon the president he said I'm the guilty one in Watergate Nixon confessed that out loud to his chief of staff Bob Haldeman more than a year before he actually resigned from office and we know that as a matter of historical fact because turns out lordy there are tapes from Watergate there aren't just the Oval Office tapes from the Nixon administration from the White House taping system turns out that Nixon's chief of staff through the whole Watergate scandal Bob Haldeman he also made tapes of his own he kept a daily audio diary of everything he did as Nixon's chief of staff I think he did it on a portable voice recorder you know how the Oval Office tapes from Watergate are all kind of crackly and some of them are really hard to hear and there's a lot of background noise Haldeman tapes are not like that Haldeman tapes are clear as a bell because I think he's just talking right into a handheld microphone and it seems from these these audio diaries that he had a habit of just making one of these audio diary entries at the end of every day to explain what he had done that day as Nixon's utterly corrupt criminal chief of staff well not long after Nixon was sworn in for his second term after he won the 72 election and the Watergate scandal really really started to pick up steam Bob Haldeman his chief of staff was one of the first people who Nixon threw overboard to try to save himself in the scandal all on the same day in April 1973 Nixon announced either the resignations or the firings of his White House Counsel the Attorney General of the United States his top domestic policy advisor who is John Ehrlichman and his White House chief of staff Bob Haldeman announced they were all out on the same day and and the day before all those guys got forced out or fired the day before he was going to announce that his sort of housecleaning that was supposed to end the Watergate scandal the day before that all happened Nixon summoned his chief of staff he summoned Bob Haldeman to come meet with him at Aspen to come to the presidential cabin at Camp David and that is where Nixon told Halderman that he needed his resignation but he told Haldeman that he too was gonna resign he said he had to resign because he was so guilty in Watergate because he as president had ordered the whole thing and then Bob Haldeman dutifully recorded that conversation into his diary that night and we've got the tape so here's the tape Haldeman you'll hear he references a guy named Ron Ziegler toward the top of this Ron Ziegler was was White House press secretary at the time but the tape otherwise is self-explanatory when we got there Ziegler said he wanted to see me and he came up went for a walk while we were waiting over at law and he was quite alarmed because he said the president has made another firm decision that he's communicated to Ron this morning which is that he too is gonna resign and Ron said he's deadly serious and absolutely firm on it when I had to Aspen the president was in terrible shape shook hands with me which is the first time he's ever done that told me to come look at the view out the window then stepped to the door and said let's go outside and look at the flowers and also we were looking at the tulips from the Aspen porch talking about the beauty and all as we started back in he said well I have to enjoy it because I may not be alive much longer we got inside and he went through a discourse saying that well nobody knows it and he's not a publicly religious man that it's a fact that he is preyed on his knees every night that he's been in the in the presidential office and that he's prayed hard over this decision and that's the toughest decision he's ever made he made the points on why I had to do it but he's come to the conclusion that he has to have our resignations he wants us to stay on to handle a transition then he went through his whole pitch about how he's really the guilty one he said he's thought it all through and that he was the one that started closing out on his projects he was the one who told Dean to cover up he was the one who made Mitchell Attorney General and later his campaign manager and so on and that he now has to face and live with it and that for that reason after he gets those other things completed that he do will probably have to resign you know you don't have to make a tape of absolutely everything right but you did so this is this is the White House chief of staff having just been fired right this is Nixon securing the resignation of his chief of staff and consider the dynamic here this is this guy being removed from office this chief of staff is neck-deep personally and clearly implicated already in all of the worst stuff of Watergate in securing that guy's resignation the president confesses to that guy you know I'm really the guilty one here I did it all I ordered all of it including the cover-up and then the chief of staff faithfully memorializes that in his diary that day which is you know dated filed away and kept for posterity there prosecutors or whatever I mean think about the legal liability that Nixon is in here Nixon knows that Haldeman has been incredibly loyal to him probably as loyal as they come but it's also more likely than not by that point that Haldeman is going to get charged with crimes related to Watergate Rison nixon went through this whole public demonstration of getting resignations from all these top people in his administration and firing all these top people in his administration it's because those are people who had already been publicly implicated in criminal activity related to Watergate so he knows the likelihood that these guys who he's pushing out are gonna get charged and the kind of pressure that might come from prosecutors if those guys are facing charges in prison time I mean my god if Bob Haldeman ever decided to tell tales about what he knew about Nixon and Nixon's involvement in Watergate and what Nixon had just confessed to him already I mean there'd be no way that Nixon could survive that for a minute Haldeman was in on all of it Nixon was still confessing to him in the moments that he was pushing him out of the White House and so the very next day after Nixon and Haldeman I've had this weird let us look at the tulips I'm gonna die I'm the guilty one I must resign confession thing the very next day after that Nixon goes back to Washington he gives his big Watergate speech where he announces all these firings and resignations of all these senior people including his chief of staff Bob Haldeman and then after that speech he goes back to his office and he calls Haldeman again Alderman's gone now he's resigned but he calls Haldeman again to talk to him about hey how'd I do in the speech and that call that call is the famous keep the faith conversation between Richard Nixon and Bob Haldeman who he has just forced out of office and effectively blamed for Watergate hears that Congress you got your points over and now you know your move on again right keep the faith Bob keep the faith I love man I love you but by God keep the faith that I mentioned you should keep the faith don't you flip on me I'm doing everything I can I love you keep the faith all right so that's from the oval office tapes but that day that's the day that Haldeman gets forced out right that's also the last diary entry that Haldeman spoke into his little audio recorder as White House chief of staff and and we know from him quite accurately recounting that conversation that he had with Nixon quite accurately recounting that conversation into his own diary we know from Haldeman perspective that Nixon's whole keep the faith admonition that sunk in as intended I said well you've got a bind you know and you should approach it that way and he said it was a very tough thing I'll never mention it again then he got feeling sorry for himself he said to me you're a strong man you got to keep the faith you're gonna win this god bless you he said again keep the faith keep the faith keep keep the faith that is how Nixon left it with his chief of staff who was up to here in Watergate who knew everything about Watergate and who he forced out because of Watergate hey Bob keep the faith you know what we did you know everything I did keep the faith you know what I mean then just two and a half weeks later everything got WAY worse because that's when the televised Watergate hearings started in Congress and that day Nixon decided hey maybe it's time to talk to Bob again make sure he got to keep the faith message now Haldeman is out at this point as chief of staff but for some reason Nixon was able to bring him back into the White House for this conversation and at this point things are desperate enough in terms of what they're figuring out they are up against what the Watergate scandal that Nixon sort of drops the whole keep the faith euphemism and just says bluntly what it is that he means the mark so that's May 1973 hmm what I mean to say this talking in the confidence of this room I don't give a bleep what comes out about you or John Ehrlichman even that poor damn dumb John Mitchell there's gonna be a total pardon Haldeman don't don't don't even say that Nixon you know it you know it and I know it Haldeman says nope don't say it and then Nixon says forget you ever heard it no I has to be done Bob that's May 1973 it turns out that tape is red-hot legal trouble for the President of the United States it's May 73 at that point Haldeman is out as chief of staff but he hasn't yet been criminally charged of course he would be ultimately months later along with all the rest of them which led to this Blockbuster front page if anybody ever wants to needlepoint me a page what a page one of the New York Times this is the one I'd want but before Haldeman was even criminally charged here was Nixon on tape in the White House telling Haldeman about the fact well you know we should reckon with the fact that you're gonna be criminally charged offering him in advance a pardon a total pardon in the president's words in that moment he knows and Haldeman knows and we will all eventually know that Haldeman knew everything that Nixon had done in Watergate up to and including Nixon confessing almost a year and a half before he resigned that yeah he had ordered the cover-up that he was the guilty one that he was the originator of the whole scheme Nixon at that point knows and Haldeman knows that if Haldeman ever wanted to flip on Nixon in this scandal Nixon wouldn't survive a MINIX Haldeman had everything on him so even before Haldeman is criminally charged Nixon offers him apartment no need to flip I'll use my pardon power to rescue you see and the reason that is a red-hot burning fuse on a legal bomb that is sitting underneath the president it's because in that moment even freaking Bob Haldeman knows now what the president just said that offer of a pardon that dangled of a pardon even Haldeman knows in that moment that that conversation is criminal obstruction of justice by the president nope don't say it don't say it because of course under the Constitution a president has the power to pardon people but you can't legally offer a pardon to someone if that would reasonably be construed as an effort to protect yourself from your own presidential criminal liability pardoning someone who's in trouble with the law fine pardoning someone who's in trouble with the law because that person is in a position to testify or not against the president that is not a legal use of the pardon power that is criminal obstruction of justice by the President or at least that was believed to be the case during Watergate including by some of the people who went to prison for Watergate but here's the fascinating part that specific tape I just played from May 1973 where Nixon offers the pardon to hauled him in and Haldeman says no don't say that don't say it that tape for some reason I don't quite know why that tape was never produced to the Watergate committees in Congress who proceeded with impeachment proceedings against Nixon for some reason I think a logistical reason I don't know for some reason that particular tape where he dangles the pardon didn't come out until years later whereupon Sam - was the chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee said had the Watergate committee received that particular tape during their investigation had that specific tape come out a quote to you from the New York Times Time quote if known to the committee at the time that would have justified a separate article of impeachment all by itself Sam - marveled - the New York Times when that tape finally came out years later quote even Haldeman was trying to shut him up they would have impeached him just for the discussion of that part under the Constitution presidents obviously can pardon people they cannot use their pardon power to obstruct another live criminal inquiry they cannot use the pardon power as leverage to persuade someone say a Bob Haldeman from flippin and cooperating with prosecutors and testifying against the President himself and I say that not because I'm a legal scholar I say that because at least that was the impression that even Nixon and his own staff labored under during the Watergate scandal that's why Haldeman was saying nope don't say that don't even say that boss and we know from Sam - saying so the exchange if known to the committee at the time would have justified a separate article of impeachment all by itself we know that the people who were preparing to impeach and remove Nixon from office over his Watergate crimes they were laboring under that assumption - yeah the president has a pardon power but not a pardon power to be used that way I mean I'm on top of everything else the chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee saying had they known about that conversation in which Nixon dangled that pardon - hauled him in that - would have been additional separate grounds for impeachment and removal from office that would have been enough yesterday there were important sort of potent brief court proceedings in the ongoing criminal investigation against the president's longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen since it is angry man swearing on tape day here at the Rachel Maddow Show you should know that NPR published this audio recording today for the first time that viscerally conveys the way Michael Cohen did legal work for President Trump over the years particularly in the context of mr. Trump's political career in the case of this audio tape released today by NPR here was lawyer Michael Cohen in 2015 let us call it liaison with a reporter named Tim Mack who was then working on a story about then candidate Donald Trump michael cohen president Trump's personal lawyer in action yesterday in court the clock started ticking in a very important and urgent way on the criminal case involving mr. Cohen in the Southern District of New York the judge in his case ruled yesterday against pleading and begging Appeals for Michael Cohen's own lawyers the judge ruled that in two weeks all the evidence seized by federal agents from Cohen's home and office that evidence will be given to federal prosecutors working out of the office of the US attorney in the Southern District of New York those materials will either be given directly to prosecutors who are pursuing the case against mr. Cohen or they'll be given to a so called taint team of separate prosecutors who will review the documents first before ultimately handing them over to those prosecutors if they don't violate attorney-client privilege but either way tik-tok it all goes in two weeks prosecutors also spelled out bluntly yesterday in court that they're currently reconstructing and piecing together the contents of the shredding machine in Michael Cohen's office the contents of which they also seized on their raid of Cohen's office again they think piecing together those shredded documents to take a couple of weeks not that hard it's the FBI after all and you know what when it comes to figuring out what's in all these documents and all this evidence they they see they've seized maybe Michael Cohen will turn out to be clean as a whistle maybe Michael Cohen and his business and legal and financial dealings will reveal him to be of saintly and civic good character if hypothetically prosecutors do discover evidence that mr. Cohen has in fact done some things that are disgusting it is expected and indeed the judge overseeing this case thus far has expressed in open court that it is likely that charges would follow fairly quickly against mr. Cohen in the Southern District of New York we would express we'd expect charges and maybe an arrest an arraignment again we learned yesterday that that all the evidence goes to the prosecutors working on the michael cohen case in two weeks we learned that yesterday today the President of the United States inexplicably pardoned a right-wing pundit who had been convicted on campaign finance felonies by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York but the same prosecutors who are now pursuing this case against his personal attorney the gentleman in question had never applied for a pardon under Justice Department pardon guidelines he was not even eligible to put his name and dwellest out the well-established pardon process at main justice this is a guy who pled guilty who admitted that he did it who said he was sorry he'd apparently used his mistress and somebody who worked for him to surreptitiously funnel an illegally large campaign donation to someone who he'd worked on a conservative publication with somebody was running for office but yesterday we found out that the prosecution of the president's longtime personal lawyer is going ahead in the Southern District of New York today the president randomly issued a full pardon to this guy who was convicted by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York the president also randomly today decided to dangle the prospect of a whole bunch of other pardons for other people you might have heard of maybe Martha Stewart maybe that Illinois Democratic governor who tried to sell Barack Obama's Senate seats and it was golden maybe others and all of this is completely outside outside the established process for presidential pardons that is a process this president is not using psychologically the president has used the pardon power in a way that is not just contemptuous of existing channels by which these things are supposed to be pursued fairly and without favor psychologically the president has started using the pardon power in a way that is designed to showcase his ability to pardon people to showcase his own power to arbitrarily pardon whoever he wants outside any system to act on a whim to do it whenever he feels like it laketop same one the state it's me or in queen speak I do what I want the problem is even for presidents of the United States even with a presidential power as broad as the pardon power you can't just do it for anybody in any circumstances you can't even just offer to do it for anybody in any circumstances not in the case of a Bob Haldeman you couldn't at least that's what they thought during Watergate and if you couldn't with Bob Haldeman why would anybody think a president could do this with Michael Cohen hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
