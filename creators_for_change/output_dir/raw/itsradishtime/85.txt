33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,490
another guy in my neighborhood who's

34
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,600
always walking these three<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

Terriers three of them and the black one

44
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,840
be it's gotten to the point where I

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,600
forget these dogs come with humans and

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,380
that the humans can hear me and then

47
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,909
they start walking a little faster

48
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,130
because they think I'm creepy so dog
