1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,729
OVER THE WEEKEND CHUCK SCHUMER
SAID THAT HE WAS FINDING IT

2
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:06,259
FRUSTRATING THAT IN HIS ATTEMPTS
AT NEGOTIATING THE SHUTDOWN

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,090
DONALD TRUMP WAS BASICALLY
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND, THAT HE

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,160
WASN'T ACTUALLY WORKING WHICH IS
ODD BECAUSE HE IS A GREAT

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,930
DEALER, DEALMAKER AND A STABLE
GENIUS BUT THE WHITE HOUSE

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,350
DIDN'T LIKE THAT SO THEY WANTED
TO SHOW HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP IS

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,260
WORKING TO GET THE RIGHT SORT OF
DEAL AND SO THEY PUT OUT

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,260
SOME PHOTOS AND THIS FIRST ONE
IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,519
THERE HE IS, WORKING HARD AND
THIS WAS IN AN EMAIL FROM

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,609
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THE
PRESIDENT, HARD AT WORK.

11
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,210
HE IS ON A PHONE.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,330
HE TOOK UP HIS TIES I GUESS HE
IS WORKING HARD.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,730
THEN THERE'S IS NEXT ONE.

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,670
HE IS WALKING FROM ONE ROOM
WHERE HE IS WORKING TO FOR

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,480
A HAVE TO ASSUME HE WILL BE
WORKING.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,020
SAME HAT.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,050
THIS IS CALLED A PHOTO OP.

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,440
AND WE HAVE ONE MORE.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,740
THIS ACTUALLY COULD BE A
MEETING.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,400
I THINK HE IS HANGING OUT WITH
FRIENDS.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,570
A COUPLE POINTS OF PEOPLE HAVE
MADE SO THIS IS NOT NEW

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,320
COMMENTARY FROM US BECAUSE IT'S
OBVIOUS WHEN YOU LOOK AT

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
THE PICTURES.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,500
NUMBER ONE, IT'S A PREDESIGNED
PHOTO SHOOT SO BY DEFINITION,

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,440
NOT ONLY IS HE NOT WORKING AT
THAT TIME HE'S TAKING WORK OUT

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,540
OF HIS SCHEDULE TO DO A PHOTO
OP.

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,030
NOW HE WILL WALK RESOLUTELY FROM
ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,750
BUT REMEMBER, DON'T CALM YOUR
HAIR.

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,230
LET'S BUT HAD ON.

30
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,290
HE DIDN'T EVEN ABOUT DOING THAT.

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,461
HE HAS LIKE WAY, I DIDN'T
HAVE TIME TO SHOWER, WAS

32
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,160
WATCHING FOX AND FRIENDS ALL
MORNING.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,460
THERE'S A HAT ON AND THEY DO
MY FAVORITE, PULL

34
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,670
UP THE FIRST PICTURE ONE MORE
TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE

35
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,860
CREDIT TO AN EDITOR AT THE DAILY
BEAST.

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,610
SHE SAID: I TOO CONDUCT MOST OF MY
IMPORTANT WORK WITH A PHONE IN

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,550
MY HAND AND NOTHING ON MY DESK WHILE
STARING VACANTLY OFF INTO SPACE.

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,659
EXCELLENT WORK ON THAT TWEET.

39
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,180
WHAT IS HE DOING?

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,340
WHO IS HE CALLING?

41
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,540
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE IS NOT THE
MIDDLE OF WORK BECAUSE HE

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,880
IS LOOKING AT THE CAMERA.

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,560
HE CAN HELP HIMSELF.

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,040
THESE PHOTOS CAME OUT AND IT
JUST MAKE THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,639
LOOK RIDICULOUS BUT I ACTUALLY
FEEL A LITTLE BIT BAD FOR THE

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,180
PHOTOGRAPHER AND WHOEVER SET IT
UP, I AM SURE THAT THEY REALIZED

47
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,430
HOW RIDICULOUS IT LOOKED AND I
BET THEY WANTED TO MAKE IT LOOK

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,650
LIKE HE WAS REALLY WORKING FOR
HIS LADY LAZY ASS, THAT'S

49
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,470
PROBABLY THE BEST HE WOULD DO
FOR THEM.

50
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,760
I WAS AT THE DESK, I DON'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH THEM.

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,950
I ALSO FEEL LITTLE BIT BAD FOR
HIM BECAUSE I WENT TO THE ARCTIC

52
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,360
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS LAST YEAR
TO PRODUCE A DOCK YOU SERIES

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,240
WHICH IS ABOUT COME OUT AND FOR
THE MOST PART, I'M BEING FILMED

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,990
AS WE ARE JUST GOING ABOUT OUR
DATE, BUT FOR PROMOS AND STUFF

55
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,220
WE HAD TO DO A FEW SHOTS WHERE
THEY ARE LIKE, WALK ALONG

56
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,050
THE FJORD, WALK TOWARD THE
CAMERA SLOW AND I DID IT.

57
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,210
I FELT RIDICULOUS.

58
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,820
TO TRUMP THAT IS WORKING.

59
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,300
HE IS LIKE WHAT YOU MEAN, I GAVE
THE APPEARANCE OF WORKING.

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
ISN'T THAT WORK?

61
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,350
WHAT ELSE WOULD HE BE DOING
THAT WOULD HE BE READING A

62
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,580
BRIEFING MEMO?

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,180
HE DOESN'T READ.

64
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,400
IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO THIS
AND HAVE ANY CREDIBILITY AT ALL,

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,150
DON'T GET ME WRONG GUYS,
POLITICIANS OF ALL STRIPES TO

66
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,180
PHOTO OPS.

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,361
SOME OF THEM GO WELL COME
SOMEONE DON'T, YOUR MEMBER THE

68
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:20,069
PHOTO OP THAT BUSH DID DURING
KATRINA WHERE HE FLEW OVER

69
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,350
AND WAS LOOKING OUTSIDE THE
WINDOW OF THE PLANE.

70
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,990
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE PHOTO OP BUT
IT WAS A PHOTO OP.

71
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,110
OBAMA DOES THEM WELL.

72
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,910
THE PHOTO THEY TOOK WHEN THEY
WERE KILLING BIN LADEN IN

73
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,440
THE SITUATION ROOM, THAT IS A
GOLDEN PHOTO UP.

74
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,440
THEY PLANNED TO HAVE A
PHOTOGRAPHER THERE BECAUSE

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,090
THEY WERE AWARE THEY ARE GOING
TO PUT THAT PICTURE OUT

76
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,190
LATER, BUT THEY DIDN'T ALL POSE.

77
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,390
THEY WERE GOOFBALLS LIKE TRUMP
GOING OKAY, HERE I AM ON

78
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,569
THE PHONE.

79
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,500
PROBABLY THE FOG PHOTOGRAPHER
TOOK 1 MILLION PICTURES AND

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,290
TOOK THE ONE THAT MADE THEM LOOK
LIST AND PUT IT OUT THERE.

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,830
JUST KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN
THE WORLD AND HOW POLITICS

82
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,290
WORKS BUT TRUMP CAN'T EVEN DO
THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THEY

83
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,239
HAVE NO EXAMPLES OF WHAT HE
WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE IS

84
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,850
WORKING BECAUSE HE NEVER WORKS
SO EVEN THE PHOTOGRAPHER

85
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,590
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT
TOGETHER, THE STAFFERS

86
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,030
DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT
TOGETHER.

87
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,050
THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT
AND IT WAS REAL, HE WOULD HAVE

88
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,029
INVITED CONGRESSMAN TO THE WHITE
HOUSE AND THEY BE WORKING ON AN

89
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,418
NEGOTIATION AND A DEAL AND IN
THE MIDST OF THAT THEY WOULD

90
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,770
TAKE 1000 PICTURES AND THEN TAKE
ONE THAT LOOKS COOL BUT HE

91
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,539
DIDN'T INVITE ANY CONGRESSMEN
BECAUSE HE IS NOT DOING ANY

92
00:04:25,539 --> 00:00:00,000
WORK.
