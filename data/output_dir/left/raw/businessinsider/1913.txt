it's very interesting in terms in the

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,330
last roughly 500 million years since the

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,330
Cambrian era there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> five major</font>

mass extinctions<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're major mass</font>

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,099
extinction the definitions vary

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:19,330
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear us but it's roughly</font>

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,400
speaking a half to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds of the</font>

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,849
species on the earth disappeared and

10
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,500
they were not perpetuated in other

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,090
species those are major major events and

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,950
we know roughly the kinds of things that

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,200
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause this to happen it's obviously</font>

major changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment be it it</font>

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,230
could be temperature or atmosphere some

16
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,030
of you know there's been debates over

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,579
what has caused each of the extinctions

18
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,190
is it gasps as releasing the atmosphere

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,030
is it is it slow relatively slow stuff

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,160
is it very quick stuff could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> volcanic</font>

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,269
activity could it be a meteoroid hitting

22
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:02,199
the earth now people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're actually undergoing a six massive</font>

24
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,740
mass extinction the rates at which

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,720
species are disappearing seems to be

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">highly elevated over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their normal rates</font>

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,670
and it's almost unquestionable that this

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,910
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with human activity and it</font>

29
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,170
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very sad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't do</font>

30
00:01:17,170 --> 00:00:00,000
something to turn that around
