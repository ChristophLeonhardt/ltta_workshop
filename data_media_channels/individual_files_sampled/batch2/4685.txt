NBC News has confirmed that longtime trump organization CFO Alan weiselberger had been given immunity by federal prosecutors weiselberger was also treasurer of the Donald J Trump Foundation the New York State Tax Department is investigating that charity joining me now is Martin shield he's a former IRS criminal investigator and Martin I guess we just have to ask you what can weiselberger offer when it comes comes to trump's foundation or his company what what are what our investigators trying to find out Thank You Ali let me first extend my respects on behalf of all federal law enforcement to mr. McCain he's always been a supporter of federal law enforcement as opposed to other politicians so in regard to your question mr. weiselberger was the CFO of the Trump Organization as well as the treasurer of the Trump Foundation he's right at the heart of following the money if we talk in terms of payments reimbursements invoices fictitious and voices and following the the posting of those expenses to the books and records of the Trump Organization we then want to track and see if those expenses moved on to the actual tax return so if you have a situation like with mr. Cohen where he was directed to provide fictitious invoices with regard to legal fees and those fees were then posted to the legal fee account question I had well you have a mr. weiselberger or someone else cooking the books of the Trump Organization this can have tax ramifications it could have corporate campaign contributions which are not allowable ramifications it could end up allowing for opening up a criminal investigation of the Trump Organization with regard to their corporate tax return filing as well as state tax return file also you have the truck Foundation which is a nonprofit organization that has a board of directors that is supposed to closely scrutinize any disbursement of foundation assets and they're supposed to push back if someone says well like mr. Trump says well I'm going to direct the foundation disbursements to my political campaign right or I'm going to take assets out of the foundation and place them in my Country Club say well look what a director is supposed to push back they're not supposed to allow that to happen so they have a fiduciary responsibility to monitor the dispersant so that of the foundation so that they only go to the mission of the foundation which you know hopefully is for things like soldiers getting scholarships now things like that and there's sufficient odds not happening so you know now mr. Weiss let me point out a couple other things with mr. Westerberg he goes back so long for so many years he knows where all the money goes and when the money comes in the chopped organization sold many many you know hundreds of luxury condominiums for millions and millions of dollars and and many of them to russian oligarch connected francs he this is the guy who's going to be able to tell us about that a lot of these purchases were in cash there was no mortgage no loan so I you know to your viewers who are wondering well where's the Russian connection well there's one possibility right there it might be here hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
