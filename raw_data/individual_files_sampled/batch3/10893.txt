it's not even dark people look out their windows and see this the first train of thought locals are just completely baffled and can't squeeze out a word a few moments later they erupt in sheer fury and they scream their next thought is it even safe to leave their homes now the hooded thugs smash blow up and burn mostly cars they know what they're doing they know how to do it they are a team in the last few days there were almost identical scenes everywhere you see a flame I can Swedish media say at least about a hundred cars are now burned out pieces of metal police have made a number of arrests but basically the country still in the dark about who's behind the Menace incomplete neutral kicked in about three weeks sweets will be voting for their new Parliament well now politicians there have more things to worry about than stuff like their election promos almost any question the question has to be asked to those be what the heck were you doing do you think you are born you destroyed the whole area for the neighbors for the children on their way to critical you have to see burnt-out cars then of course they must be hard response from society somewhat strong words but not as emotional as society which clearly wants the ones in charge to get it sorted such neighborhood disasters don't come out of nowhere when it comes to all kinds of street crime lately Sweden's been getting less and less safe one time I was attacked by five people and they took my wallet and bike phone and everything increased number of shootings it's gotten worse in every way policeman said that he had never experienced anything like that before he's changed too radically it is not the sweet I remember and when years of ignoring the trends backfired literally with flames someone the Swedish elite chose not to talk about mistakes rather they came up with conspiracies where in other words pointed the finger at right-wing extremists some quote-unquote dark forces they want the elections to be about arsons they want to fuel disgust and fear I hope the whole thing is not orchestrated by the dark forces that threaten our democracy and our independence last night's events with one month left before the election were well organized did not surprise me if the extreme rights were involved in some way a false flag by the extreme right version is popular among some journalists to Sweden Democrats sympathizes of running around in the suburbs burning cars in a coordinated action to direct criticism and the suburbs population in the hope of favoring SD to make sure Sweden can dodge any Russian efforts to screw up its election Stockholm has even splashed out on the media so that they could wipe out the neverending fake news that was only to be hit by a wave of homegrown conspiracies before the police had at least something solid for the public Ilya petrenko arty Swedish police note that similar attacks have happened in several Swedish towns in previous years but on a far smaller scale and we spoke to Swedish Democratic MP Kent Ekeroth whose party has sparked controversy over its anti-immigration stance he says people are starting to realize that Sweden is not as safe as they thought the situation in Sweden has started to slip out in the international arena when people suddenly realize whoops Sweden is not the nice little same country thought it was but now realized what the hell happened to Sweden and so this has been going for a long time and we have had major arsons and riots many years back I just saw some statistics that the arson attacks in cars with intent has gone up in 12 to 38 percent and from 1967 to 1500 cases a year something like that so I mean it's been going up in in actual numbers too you
