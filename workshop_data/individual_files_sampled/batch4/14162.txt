President Trump and the Department of Justice are finally doing something bumping to put a dent in the problem of illegal immigration now we've got this caravan of 1,500 people now yesterday it was a thousand 1,100 now it's 1500 people coming mostly from Honduras from Central America there are about four days away from the United States and the group Pueblo sinfronteras or people Without Borders it's accusing president Trump of bullying of hateful rhetoric because he wants to protect our borders and the president's right President Trump tweeted Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the u.s. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies caravans are heading here must pass tough laws and build the walls build a wall Americans allow open borders drugs and crime he also tweeted a big caravan of people from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our he's right weak laws border had better be stopped before it gets their cash cows NAFTA is in play as his foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen Congress must act now Congress won't act because even Republicans in Congress are beholden to the US Chamber of Commerce that needs that cheap illegal labor the President Trump and the Department of Justice are trying to do something and what they're doing I think is a very very smart solution Congress won't pass the laws so what the DOJ is now doing is they're imposing quotas they're imposing quotas on immigration judges immigration judges now have to clear 700 cases yearly it's a 650,000 case backlog but they have to Claire clear 700 cases yearly dues from NBC News to earn at least a satisfactory rating six other measures being imposed on the judges indicate how much time they should spend on different types of cases and court motions because this stuff is pretty clear-cut it's pretty clear-cut if you're here illegally and you want to make a case for asylum you should have to present evidence you shouldn't just be able to waltz across the border and it really did blow my mind when I heard that we were on a 650 650,000 case backlog if sessions Turney general who I'm very critical of on many things wrote but but on this on immigration he's strong sessions wrote judges that wrote judges that performance measures would aid in quote the efficiency and the efficient and timely completion of cases and motions while maintaining fairness now of course of course immigration groups are beside themselves over this because how dare the u.s. enforce its sovereignty how dare the u.s. enforce its borders I mean how dare we act like a sovereign nation the measures are very specific the judge who completes more than 560 cases per year but fewer than 700 needs improvement deciding fewer than 15 60 cases yearly is deemed unsatisfactory the Justice Department said Monday the judges complete an average of 678 cases per year they want the minimum up they want it to be 700 cases to be considered satisfactory under one benchmark there's still from the NBC news story under one benchmark judges must rule that same day on every play by asylum seekers to pass an initial threshold of establishing credible or reasonable fear to earn a satisfactory mark we read that again under one benchmark judges must rule that same day on every plea by asylum seekers the asylum seekers must pass a threshold of establishing credible or reasonable fear meaning fear that if they go back to the nation from which they came they'll face some kind of punishment torture death or imprisonment whatever to earn a satisfactory mark so the judges have to rule on whether or not the evidence presented by the asylum seeker is satisfactory in the same day to be to be considered by the asylum seekers meets the criteria for DOJ to consider the judge satisfactory this means judges can no longer keep pushing things out pushing things out increasing that backlog the only exception is if the Department of Homeland Security can't get the asylum seeker in front of the judge anything less than 80% of meeting that benchmark will be deemed unsatisfactory I love it I love it now the National immigration judges Association doesn't like this what unions never do they say quote we believe the imposition of numerical performance metrics is completely and utterly contrary to judicial independence too bad too bad nobody forced you to be the immigration judge our country has an immigration crisis you chose the job do the job Department of Justice is now telling you what your standards are make it happen and no I don't believe it takes days and weeks and months to determine whether or not somebody's petition for asylum is valid if they are truly in fear where they're making up an excuse to stay in the United States illegally we have a crisis we have a crisis and this story runs much deeper and I'm going much deeper into it today on my longer show off-the-cuff
