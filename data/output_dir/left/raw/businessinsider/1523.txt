00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,440
lawyer's wishes when she releases her

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,089
33,000 emails that have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> deleted as</font>

prohibition on releasing it when you're

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,289

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's not as charitable as he claims to</font>
