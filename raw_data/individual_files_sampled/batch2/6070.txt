Republican mo Brooks of Alabama attended a hearing of the House Science Space and Technology Committee on Wednesday and he had some hot takes on why the sea levels are rising Brooks pointed to silt deposition as well as erosion as a cause of rising sea levels Brooks postulated that silt and mud washed by rivers into the ocean caused water levels to rise as it settled onto the seafloor now you have got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up he said he goes on to say what about the White Cliffs of Dover in California where you have those waves crashing against the shoreline and time and time again you have the cliffs crashing into the sea all of that displaces water which forces it to rise does it not well he was asking little Duffy who is a scientist from the Woods Hole Research Center who just briefly responded with I'm pretty sure in a human time scale those are minuscule effects so I think it's important to remember that and then before I toss the panel I just want to make us all a little bit smarter since we got Dumber from hearing that global warming and rising sea levels this is coming from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration we live in and share a world that is unequivocally appreciably and consequentially warmer than just a few decades ago and our world continues to warm that's from scientists deke Arndt and then a separate analysis of global temperature data from NASA also found last month that this was the third warmest April on record this is also the most the 400th consecutive month of above average temperature and lastly another milestone was reached this April also related to the number 400 carbon dioxide the gas scientists say is most responsible for global warming reached its highest level in recorded history at 410 parts per million so I'm just gonna toss it over to you guys what do you how do you feel when you hear such misinformation coming from the House Science Space and Technology Committee that's hilarious so I actually watched part of that tape and and we touched on this issue earlier in the day on damage report which you should check out on YouTube TV starring John I role and in the video mo Brooks is like and and then the rocks fall in the water or whatever it is well you're the congressman on the Technology Committee so you should kind of figure out what it is before you ask the actual scientists because and Philadelphia was like no that's not really how it works and then mo Brooks went on to say well then town de Guise she'd it's grown in it and don't feels like new no it's not in fact the ice sheet has shrunk by one thousand four hundred and sixty three kilometers in just the six years between 2010 and 2016 so he's wrong on every count which amazes me is that look I know that you're working for the fossil fuel industry that's your donors and you're trying to spread misinformation but that you didn't bother to be artful about it that your staff didn't prepare you with a better excuse than rocks are falling on the water in it and they did just not even trying so I don't know if this is indicative of what's happening to Republicans overall but I have lately seen some changes in their perception in regard to climate change which gives me hope because here's what the fact of the matter is everyone regardless of political affiliation knows that these politicians are bought Republicans are just as angry as you know the left-wing is when it comes to this issue they also have eyes and ears and they can see what's happening and so they're experiencing the extreme weather conditions they're seeing the glaciers you know melting and receding so I'll give you an example recently I went to Alaska and I was surrounded by Trump supporters I went on a cruise are you okay I'm all right I survived it and you know they were for the most part Trump supporters on our ship and we were on tours with them once we finally got to Alaska so we went to see the Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau Alaska and it was fascinating to hear these Trump supporters talk about how you know kind of shy and sheepishly talk about how oh you know I mean I don't mean to be political but you know this seems to be happening you know this Mendenhall Glacier has been receding considerably they can see it with their eyes they're afraid to talk about it because it's such a taboo in their party at the moment but they do see it another example is a Glacier Bay which you know if you have you know or if you're ever lucky enough to you know sail through it or cruise through it you will see these giant pieces of ice that have fallen from the glaciers into the water and I would overhear people talking about that on the ship as we were cruising through it people see that it's happening so these politicians I mean maybe it's still working to some extent but luckily and hopefully people will continue waking up to what's really going on well as Bush you see hadn't happened yet I was in Louisiana and it was so hot and I think it was the beginning of spring and I was talking to a bird driver or whoever he was and and I'm like man it is crazy hot he's and he's like oh definitely I'm like it seems to be getting hotter and hotter right he's like all the time I wonder if Gore was right he's like yeah you know wish people that are in such high positions in public office would think before they would speak because that just doesn't make any sense you know we need more science yeah they're paid not to think yeah essentially yeah I mean if that's what we're getting you know I think I think that we there's a lot of you know growth that needs to happen I do kind of wonder like for so long it felt like people would just deny climate change and as you point out Anna you can't do that anymore because you can see we're all experiencing climate change it's to a point where it's absolutely undeniable that the climate is changing and it feels like it's like progress and at the same time it's you know five steps back to acknowledge yes things are changing the sea levels are rising but here's my dumb explanation for why you know so like in the one sense it is progress because remember it for so long they just say no it's not and here's my bunk scientist that's gonna say that it's not really happening even though the overwhelming majority of scientists disagree with this one person we're touting out before this committee so you know what I mean it's sort of like I'm glad that we're having these committees and having these conversations but oh my goodness is this dumb yeah this doesn't pass a middle school science fair yeah you're absolutely right and I unfortunately forgot the name of the senator who did this but there was this incredible video a couple years ago of a Senate who goes Senate floor and he's holding a snowball and he's using that snowball as evidence that the climate has not been getting warmer well so that Senator Inhofe yeah I was thinking right and meanwhile you can show a chart of how the temperature has been rising through the through the roof so on the one hand we have global data backed up by every scientists in the world on the other hand Inhofe has a snowball by the way mo Brooks is the one that lost to Roy Moore when he ran for that Senate seat and he was considered the moderate
