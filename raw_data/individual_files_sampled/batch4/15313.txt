welcome to s relevance battleground it's April 30th and I am as from lavance battleground what is that it is a new thing every day at 12:00 noon Eastern until 1:00 p.m. we're gonna have a live video podcast chat I just put all those words together but basically what it means is instead of pre taping a show like I do for my 8 p.m. show every day behind the paywall we're gonna have a publicly available chat and Google has a term for they call a super chat which means you as viewers can write your comments as so many youtubers do and if you want your comment to be pinned to the top of the screen you can pay a couple bucks and it's called a super Jack comment and it stays up there and my goal is to read as many of the super chat comments as I can if you can get a comment in edgewise while I am talking about the battles of the day so it's not just an open battle where you get to battle me with your questions I'm going to talk about stories today including what I think is an amazing story over the last few days which is the White House Correspondents Association annual press club dinner in Washington DC Donald Trump himself did not attend he rather had a rally in Michigan but many of his senior aides did will talk about that total meltdown and I will turn my eye to the super chat screen and read out super comments as they come in so I'm gonna be looking at my screen on my computer here but I'm also gonna be looking at the camera I have an earpiece so our team here will tell me if there's a super chat by the way if you can't watch this live between noon and 1:00 p.m. Eastern every day don't worry it will be uploaded for review later and it'll be in podcast form the only downside to tuning in that way is you can't super chat I'm going to say that we're super chat about 50 times but without further ado I want to talk about this White House Correspondents Dinner or as so many people on Twitter call it nerd prom but I don't think that that's a fair statement nerds or geeks there they're actually you know they're just a little socially awkward but they have some redeeming Val I mean Bill Gates Steve Jobs you could say they were nerds or geeks but they weren't the kind of to you to borrow the phrase from Dave Berg the kind of garbage people that operate in the media parties highest levels who full of self regard for themselves and every year that the White House Correspondents Dinner gets worse and worse and worse and Trump knew it and he stayed away but this one was so bad even some liberal journalists afterwards were trying to distance and distance themselves from it saying it was just over the top it was gross it was I mean of course it was profane and obscene but I mean that comes with comedy I think but it was just so unfunny it was just Democrat talking points with a laugh track over but the laugh track was provided by the White House Correspondents themselves and that's my first point I'm gonna play four clips for you thing but my first point is all of these liberal journalists who the day after when seeing how poorly this was received are washing their hands of it and say no no no I don't like how that went I watched the full 20 odd minute video of the the comedians take being were laughing they were chanting along there was a call and repeat Donald Trump is broke how broke is he like weird stuff weird weird stuff it was full audience participation so don't buy it when they say oh no no this this wasn't representative of us it absolutely was I want to play I've got five clips for him and what strikes me is how the comedian her name was Michelle wolf put aside for a second that she was unfunny most of her attacks were against women around Donald Trump sure she took a few shots at Trump himself including the weirdest one that he's not a rich man that's just a weird thing to attack him on there was one or two shots that Mike Pence but other than some token shots at the president vice president her vitriol her rage was focused on any women around Donald Trump don't you think that's weird I'm going to start with clip number a weird attack on Kellyanne Conway first woman to chair a successful presidential campaign successful pollster in her own right great pundit busy mom I mean just such an accomplished woman take a look at how Michelle wolf takes a run at Kellyanne calmly Kellyanne on your show all she does is lie if you don't give her a platform she has nowhere to lie it's like that old saying if a tree falls in the woods how do we get Kelly in under that tree suggesting she gets hurt just stop you know I mean I guess that's sort of funny I just think she should be stuck under a tree but the first part there why do you put I mean I'm not gonna try and do her screechy voice I think I think that's the only comedic effect here is her screechy voice is it really funny the same why do you guys put Kellyanne Conway on TV all she does is lie I mean I like jokes I like funny anti-trump jokes and I think there's probably some funny jokes to be made about Kellyanne Conway this funny jokes we made about everyone in politics but just sort of screeching why do you put her on TV all she does is lie why are you letting her lie I just don't think that's even funny and and it's what Rob Schneider said about Saturday Night Live the other day said my life has always made fun of politicians and it's always tilted to the left but it's never been so angry and rageful I think I thought it was very astute when he pointed out that Dana Carvey when he mocked George HW book Bush he did it with a little bit of underlying affection for Bush's humanity he didn't hate Bush when he mocked him Alec Baldwin is so full of spit flecked fury when he does Donald trust not funny anymore you couldn't be a funny liberal this ain't bad I want to move to the next clip and and this keeps with the theme of despising women and I think the most vicious attacks in politics I against women are by women and what's so funny is funny is this Michelle wolf the comedian I think she styles herself as a feminist I think so so she took a run at Ivanka Trump Ivanka in my mind is almost like a first lady named Melania Trump obviously is the first lady but she's she's pretty low-key she's pretty quiet I've never heard Melania talk about anything political in public at all Ivanka is a little bit more engaged so she's sort of like a surrogate First Lady in that way but but very inoffensive never takes on prickly issues take a look at how Michelle wolf the hired recruited entertainment for the White House Correspondents Dinner here's her take on Ivanka Trump there's also of course Ivanka she was supposed to be an advocate for women but it turns out she's about as helpful to women as an empty box of tampons she's done nothing to satisfy women so I guess like father like daughter oh you don't think he's good in bed come on she don't clean up nice though Ivanka cleans up nice she's the diaper genie of the administration on the outside she looks sleek but the inside it's delish it so it's gross I mean like an empty box of tampons I guess that's feminist humor and and the the joke there at the end you're like a diaper genie shining on the outside inside you're full of shit I don't think that's a joke I think that could be a building block in a larger joke if there were something there that's just sort of a generic insult you could you could throw at anyone you're full of shit it's a quote I mean it's it's just you you could theoretically have said that about anyone there was no substance there other than this comedian was saying she's not woman enough or has let down women so she said generic anti-female insult I think and it's not funny I think that's my that's the greatest crime committed here it just wasn't funny I got a question for you before I move on to the next clip would that generic anti-female insult be applied against any Democratic Party woman against Michelle Obama against Malia Obama against a guy I think the answer is obviously it would be no I want to read two more clips before I do let me take him in to remind you what we're doing today is the soft launch of Ezreal advanced battleground we didn't announce that we didn't even tweet it we didn't email about it we just sort of snuck it in here because we're trying it out I hope people like it the idea is take an hour in the middle of the day do a live chat take comments by super chat play some video clips and throw it on a podcast afterwards so if you liked it let me know well roll it up tomorrow I think you think the things go well today we'll announce it a bit we'll tweet it but we're just testing our systems and I hope you like it I want to move to the next clip this comedian Michelle wolf is her name took an extended run at Sarah Huckabee Sanders who is Donald Trump's press secretary I think she does a pretty good job as press secretary it's sort of impossible to it's an impossible job and the burnout and the the turnover rate in any country for the chief spokesman of a politically controversial leader is extremely high I mean in Canada every year under Stephen Harper I mean you get worn out you replace it in Donald Trump I think this is the third person I think she does a pretty fair job so what's the criticism of her I put it to you it's the same as a criticism of Kalyan Conway or Ivanka Trump there's no substantive criticism other than well if it was a conservative doing what we what would be called anti female bigotry or misogyny take a look at this first clip of Michelle wolf attacking Sarah Sanders and of course we have Sarah Huckabee Sanders we are graced with Sarah's presence tonight I have to say I'm a little star-struck I love you as aunt Lydia on The Handmaid's Tale my pants if you haven't seen it you would love it every time Sara steps up to the podium I get excited because I'm not really sure what we're gonna get you know a press briefing a bunch of lies or divided into softball teams it shirts and skins and this time don't be such a little bitch Jim Acosta I'm just waiting for the funny though I'm waiting for the funny I think there should be a lot of room to make fun of the press secretary for Donald Trump I mean if I had to do it I'm a trump sympathizer if I had to think of a way to make fun it could be trying to explain some of Donald Trump's funnier quirkier more outrageous more offensive tweets and happy there's a very tough job Sarah Huckabee Sanders there could that's a rich vein to mine if you're looking for comedy but again what was the joke I doubt I mean and I'm not even gonna try and mock that bad voice I think that's her only stick is her voice if the only thing she can come up with is I don't know are we in for a pack of lies well that's what she said about about Kellyanne Conway why do you let her lie she's a liar and Sarah Huckabee Santas just a pack of lies it's just not funny that's the big crime so far yeah it's an attack on all the women around Trump in the name of feminism weird tampon jokes weird diaper jokes but just not funny but but look at this look at this next one here here's a woman who's not exactly the most comely of entertainers Michelle wolf who's only 32 if you would have told me she was 52 I would have believed it and the only reason I'm her marking on her own appearances well that's how she took a run at Sarah Huckabee Sanders take a look at this next clip I actually really like Sarah I think she's very resourceful like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye like maybe she's born with it maybe it's lies it's probably life and I'm never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders you know if it's Sarah Sanders is it Sarah Huckabee Sanders is it cousin Huckabee is it auntie Huckabee Sanders like what's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women Coulter a few things here again just the lies she makes it a lot I mean yeah we get it you know first of all I think there's probably some truth that every press secretary for every president in history has told some spin some half-truths and probably even some lies I get it but but if you're just standing up there and I mean you're screeching tones likewise she's just a liar it's it's very tiresome and it's you know being a comedian is more than just democratic party talking points with a laugh track now she went on a little bit longer about I guess I cut the clip a little short about different names to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders and she referred to the TV show The Handmaid's Tale which is about a mythical Christian theocracy a misogynist theocracy of course there are misogynist theocracies in the world they're Muslim like the Israel Islamic Republic of Iran or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but there was a particular insulting I don't think I have the clip here I'm sorry I cut shows a time coach wrong she compared Sarah Huckabee Sanders to aunt Lydia it's aunt Lydia of this show the hammy so let me just put that picture up on the screen for a second so that's aunt Lydia and here's here's the the media spin that handmaids tell joke at the White House Correspondents Dinner was not a slam on Sarah Sanders looks well yes it was and that's the very reason why you're writing this spin who's the liar now and my point is every attack so far on the women around Ivanka Trump Kellyanne Conway or Sarah Sanders has been personal has been female and it's in its targeting and in the case of Sarah how to be Sanders has been about her makeup her look and actually comparing her to a manly ugly woman on handmade still a theocratic Stern woman I give full marks to Sarah out to be Sanders for standing there and not taking the vote sorry and and not rising to the bait not walking out sitting there and absorbing the punishment as Donald Trump did at a previous White House Correspondents Dinner the one where they all mocked him and Barack Obama himself said you'll never be President Trump stood there and he took the blows and in some ways it was very untrim plike wasn't it for Trump to sit there and take barbs and insults and not fight back but Trump's no dummy Trump knew that everyone watching the abuse hurled on him by the fancy people every severely normal American and Canadian and people around the world who saw that they thought she's talking about me to she's insulting me - she's smearing me - every woman who would even consider voting for Donald Trump or Republicans surely felt the sting of those remarks every woman whether or not the Republican who maybe isn't as beautiful as Michelle wolf the comedian with the screechy voice probably thought oh well if you're taking a run at her for her looks I mean she's doing the best with what she has she's put together well enough and she was obviously hired for her talent and not because she's a you know a centerfold knockout so the fact that Michelle wolf is attacking her based on her appearance even though I mean she's quite respectable and and was hired for merit the fact that the fancy people took a run at her for how she looked and and Kellyanne Conway and the Ivanka Trump as well don't you think the rest of us watching that would say oh they hated her they will hate me too and I think the grace with which Sarah Huckabee Center stood there and took him was actually the highlight of the evening now I think you may have seen some of these clips on the internet or elsewhere especially the personal attacks against Sarah Huckabee Sanders and I say again after the video got out and it was just a shock to flyover country too severely normal Americans I mean a lot of the fancy folks who were at the dinner later said oh no no I totally disagree with that I pronounced that I separate myself from a Maggie Haberman of the New York Times said that I should tell you I watched the entire 20 odd minute video and it was full of applause I say again the Michelle feel I Michelle wolf led the audience in a call-and-response they were active participants and I saw a tweet today a couple of of MSNBC journalists said they were appalled by went on but well by what went on not appalled enough to skip the after party though they went to the after party and totally hung out with Michelle wolf that's how furious they were at things that what we've been looking at so far are the personal attacks on the women around Trump done by a woman herself and I guess that's the Democrat way god forbid a woman wants to be a Republican like Kanye West god forbid a black man even criticizes the Democrats Kanye West is not a Republican as he said the other day he doesn't even know if he's a conservative but the fact that he dares question the Democrats he's fair game for every smear around same thing with Republican women isn't it I want to show you though a 15 second clip and this is my last clip from the White House Correspondents Dinner I want to show you what I thought was actually a more telling reminder of how the White House Correspondents are out of sync with America let me just play it it's a clip on abortion it's only 15 seconds take a look at this Mike Pence is also very anti choice he thinks abortion is which first of all don't knock it till you try it and when you do try it really knock it you know you gotta get that baby out of there yeah I'm not sure why that's a comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Dinner or not sure what that has to do with journalism I'm not sure what that has to do with even poking fun at Trump or others that's just a plain old Planned Parenthood ad but but the thing about moderate pro-choicers I'd say is they they say it's a choice but they realize it's an awful choice they realize that aborting a baby does stop a beating heart and it's a terrible thing and it's not optimal but the argument from moderate pro-choicers is but it's better than the alternative and you can dispute that and I would but this is not a pro-choice argument this is a pro-abortion argument that's just having a lot of fun about abortion don't knock it till you try it and really knock it you got to get that baby out of there apropos of nothing I think it's my first comment just just out of there applause maybe a few groans but just the normalization and the laughing the laughs ocation I'm making up a word of that completely tone-deaf I think that for most Americans and Canadians and people around the world abortion is a tough tough issue a morally wrenching issue a difficult issue and and both sides understand the toughness of it if you're pro-life you understand there are some cases where the woman involved is in desperate straits there may have been a rape there may have been extreme poverty there may be a child that's a disabled it's very tough morally from a pro-life point of view and it's very tough from a pro-choice point of view or it should be to abort a baby but not for Michelle wolf who thinks it's a hilarious thing to joke about and I say again apropos of nothing that that's really got nothing to do with taking a run at Trump or pence or Kellyanne Conway or Sarah Humphrey Sanders it's just a little paid announcement by the White House Correspondents Dinner and the fact that that weirdness that macabre celebration of abortion which no moderate pro-choice or should ever celebrate what's the pro-choice phrase safe legal and rare isn't that the isn't that the pro-choice phrase we want to be safe legal and rare that's not what Michelle wolf said and I know she was joking but like I say with the rest of her comments jokes should be funny and I don't think this was but more than that I think it showed where the moral and political center is for the press corps that Lords it over the rest of us I think it was a disaster for them it reminded me so many ways of the disastrous Oscars except for the Oscars at least have beautiful people and the comedian's are sort of funny this was a poor man's ugly man's Oscars I don't even think he would show up in the ratings I mean Jimmy Kimmel's Oscars this year had the lowest ratings in that show's history I don't think there are ratings for the White House Correspondents Dinner but if there were how could this possibly show up those are my five videos I wanted to show you from the White House Correspondents Dinner let me talk again about what we're doing today it's sort of something we thought we would just slide into your watching sort of a why I would call it a beta test a test run soft launch is another way to say it we didn't even tell anyone we were doing this we just said let's just do it let's see if anyone watches let's see if anyone participates it's a live podcast that we're doing it every day if it works out from 12:00 noon til 1:00 p.m. Eastern just know my damn I mean my my show that I do every night at 8:00 p.m. i pre record it's a little bit more produced it's scripted so I'm not rambling but the fun stuff of having it on this Google super chat is that you can chat to me in real time anyone can make a comment and if you want your super chat to be pinned at the top you can kick in a couple bucks and make a comment and I think I saw one sneak by I was looking at the camera I think I saw one come by but I don't think there was a comet attached to it I'll ask her I don't think that there was one attached to it so we're gonna have this live every day and then we're gonna put it up as a regular YouTube video that can be rewatched later and as a podcast I see there's 369 people watching now which is not bad but I'm hoping that if we promote it a little bit we'll get those numbers up because we've got a lot of YouTube viewers one of the things is we put out so many YouTube videos that sometimes people I think say it's a little overwhelming we do 10 to 15 and day as opposed to some of my heroes in the world of YouTube like for example Paul Joseph Watson who does a few a week and they're so good and so special everyone who's a follower has make sure they watch all of them whereas with us we have a lot of videos so we'll see if this can punch through because we have over nine hundred thousand subscribers I don't know if it's the kind of thing they're looking for I'm gonna turn to some of the comments that are coming in right now they're not super chat comments they're just regular comments I'm just going to pick a couple out of the blue the term Islamophobia was created by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1984 now Canada is imposing a law to protect the invaders while rejecting Christianity that's from pastor Phil Biggs you're referring to a motion in Canada's Parliament called m103 now it was a motion not a bill and by that I mean it was just a statement calling on the Government of Canada to study Islamophobia and indeed the government did they had this committee that studied it for months and published a huge report that report does not yet have the force of law but it does crystallize the government's thinking there's some terrifying recommendations in there including mandatory training for any professional in Canada you're a doctor a lawyer a pharmacist or an engineer you have to be trained in Islamophobia media training not just for journalists but for the public permanent anti Islamophobia bureaucracies with permanent budgets to justify a perpetual ongoing hate crime hunt there's even a call for a national Islamophobia day I'm not making that up that's all in there there's about 30 recommendations they not yet being put into the form of law it'll be interesting to see if they are I think they will be and I think in fact the Liberal Party Justin Trudeau in particular and his many Muslim cabinet ministers will want to make this a defining issue in the 2019 election I think that will happen so we'll have to see what happens there but it is not yet law but we do have other laws in Canada we have Human Rights commissions and I myself was dragged in front of one the operator Human Rights Commission about a dozen years ago for publishing the Danish cartoons of Muhammed and that was done before Islamophobia was really a big thing that was just a law that was on the books in my home province of Alberta for decades and it was just some radical Imam born in Pakistan did the madrasah circuit just thought oh there's an illiberal tool just lying around let me take it and use it to attack this liberal democracy that I'm in so this Pakistani born Muslim radical used an old illiberal law in the books to come after me in the Western Standard magazine for almost three years so even without this latest Mo m103 motion there there was an Islamophobic law on the books I see another super Chad Victoria pizanno I'll read it please try to make more videos on YouTube it's difficult to be subscribed to you Infowars Tommy Robinson etc and try to follow your channels to your personal websites it's a lot to take in you're so right and I was just talking to my friends here about some of the sites I go to all the time there's I mentioned Paul Joseph Watson I'm a super fan Tommy Robinson was a real star with us now he's independent his videos are excellent they're not as frequent as they were but they're very powerful and I and I remain a strong moral supporter of Tommy there's other talent in fact there's an up-and-comer in Canada named Spencer Fernando he's based in Winnipeg I really like what he says and does there's another talent in the Toronto area named Jill Colton so I think one of the things we can do at the rebel is embed their YouTube videos into our page and what I mean by that is I'm not sure how familiar are with YouTube but it it's built to be shared and plugged in so they would be branded Tommy Robinson Paul Joseph Watson Spencer Fernando Jill Colton steven crowder still does some great ones that would be branded that way but they would just be in our website has found content we do a bit it out right now I don't know if you know but every day we for example have a list of stories from around the web including some videos on the issue of the islamification of the west and the compiler the aggregator there his name is Victor Laszlo as the name he goes by so we do some of that aggregation work right now and the plus side of the people that we embed is they still get all the clicks from the traffic so if we're if you're watching I apologize of Watson video on that's embedded on the rebel web site Paul will still get his tenth of a cent per view or whatever it is so that's a good idea and I think we should do more that you're right I mean just to remember to go to everyone's YouTube pages as long I'm gonna read another comment again if you want to make a super check you can I will try to read there's only been a couple of them so far but I'll read some of the regular chats as well and that laying Spencer Fernandez and Jill Colton are awesome yes Spencer Fernando he's from Winnipeg I like him more and more just very solid reliable concern is very quick he turns things around quickly I like him I've invited them to participate but he told me he's very busy getting his own show going but he's he said we should feel free to embed his video so I think we should do that more Morgana Dundee says still waiting on Trudeau apologizing for the hijab hoax you're so right for those who aren't aren't familiar with that I guess a couple months ago now 11 or 12 year old Muslim girl who wore a hijab claimed that she was attacked on her walk to school by a man for the barest scissors who came up to her and very quietly started cutting her jab didn't swear at her didn't God just came up to her cuz cuz what guy doesn't walk around carrying scissors looking to cut his jab parently he went away and came back and did it again and he was very careful not to poke her it was just weird weird story and this eleven-year-old came to the school and they called police and what would you do if there's a crazy guy out there with scissors attacking little girls with with scissors well you would put the school on lockdown probably like close the doors called the police maybe calling the mom have the kid protected hunt for the perpetrator but that is not what the school did the school had a press conference and not just that they put this 11 and 12 year old girl in the middle of a national press conference you don't do that first of all you just identified the girl's name and face and details to the perp who was still allegedly at-large why are you putting an 11 year old girl in front of the national press corps anyways what about privacy what about the fact that she's just a girl but so many strange things her little brother was laughing and smiling the whole time everyone seemed to be totally wrong and then this girl said it was an Asian man and that was just weird I think she was prepped coach to say Caucasian but what 11 year old knows the word Caucasian so she probably heard Asian I mean it was so clearly fake but my god did everyone love that narrative Justin Trudeau Kathleen Wynne John Tory the prime minister premier and mayor all tweeted about it was a hundred news stories but the following two police said it was all a hoax unfortunately the mother is not yet being charged with filing a false police report which is a crime in Canada but we set up a petition called hijab hokestar , asking for the mother to be investigated but 50,000 signatures which is enormous and what was so interesting is that say about half those signatures were from Chinese Canadians who felt especially unfairly blamed named and shamed in this hoax I mean it it was it my hunch is that this 11 and 12 year old Muslim girl was coached to say Caucasian because that's the narrative angry white men versus saintly hit Jabby Muslim but she said Asian and I should tell you that there have been protests coast-to-coast in this country by Chinese Canadians outraged the fact that Trudeau and others weird the Chinese community and never apologize to correct that I should say though when I was out in Calgary a couple of weekends ago at the pro pipeline rally a member of the Chinese community came to me there specifically to thank us for pushing back on that I think it really hurt the Chinese Canadian community who is so law-abiding and so untroubled making to be falsely accused of doing something like this and it was one thing when it was 11 year old girl and her mom but when the Prime Minister himself did it I think that that deeply hurt them I mean I have to tell you I haven't I've rarely seen a story with such legs well you're watching Ezreal avance battleground it's the first time we're doing it we started in telling me when we're doing and we were just sort of sneaked it on YouTube to see how it was working what a super charities you can comment in real time because this is a live broadcast if you want your comment pinned to the top of the page you can chip in a couple of bucks and it'll happen otherwise I'll just randomly select saw is Jonathan brian says saw interview with Brad Trost nice to see federal conservatives willing to talk to the rebel well Jonathan that's the thing about Brad roast he is a Conservative MP I'd say he's a very conservative MP and he did well in the conservative leadership race he did come on our show we had a good hearty conversation about a number of things including his situation in the party I didn't want to get too deeply into it but he will not be running as a Conservative candidate in the next election because he did not win his nomination and he's actually involved in some litigation against the party itself not the parliamentary caucus but the party and I think that's why he came on the show because he's he doesn't care about party discipline or what Andrew Shearer says because I think Andrew Shearer has put a fatwa on the rebel not to have any of his MPs come on the show now I know some of them want to they chat with us they give us tips they talked to us but Andrew Shearer has told any Conservative MP who comes on the rebel even just to be interviewed about a news item that they will be punished and Russia will punish any Conservative MP wants to come on the rebel to talk to any of our people means Sheila got read David menses anyone it's a punishment and if she doesn't put that punishment on anyone talking to any other media that I know of not to state-owned media like our team Russia today not to the CBC home of Jian Ghomeshi home of every left-wing extremist home of David Suzuki if you do an interview on the CBC the home of young MSU David Suzuki and you sure won't mind one bit because he'll do the interview right behind you but if you talk to the rebel and Russia won't abide it I should say it's the same thing with Jason Kenney in Alberta we had a United Conservative Party MLA named drew Barnes who agreed to come to our rally when Jason Kenney found out about it he threatened the MP of the MLA who backed down I find it bizarre this self-hatred on the right it's obvious that we agree on 99% of things with both of these parties but to cut some ice with the CBC and the media party both under Shearer and Jason Kenney have made the political decision to bend the knee to the CBC and the Toronto Star and The Globe and Mail to listen to the Mean Girls of the media party rather than the media outlet that more accurately and fairly and comprehensively cover story of interest of the base does it hurt my feelings not particularly we do what we do in any event but it worries me in that if you're willing to bend the knee to the media party over trifles when it doesn't count a year or two before the election imagine what you'll cave in to the media party on when it does count and in my monologue tonight on my pay wall show you'll see a bit of that when we talk about Andrew Shearer pledging on CTV to reduce carbon emissions to abide by the UN global warming treaty that is so bizarre and the only explanation I can think of that for Andrew sheers he wants to appease the CBC that ain't going to happen you will not buy their love isn't that the lesson of the White House Correspondents Dinner don't play their game either ignore them if you have to deal with them deal with them minimally and honestly don't suck ah isn't that the lesson that Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave us I see there's another super channel read it Victoria pizanno sorry quick question you've got a laptop to see our chats what are you using to make this live feed I'm starting my own show and would love any tips great question again we're just trying this out we're figuring this out for the first time ourselves I'm looking at your right on the laptop I'm looking at our YouTube channel just like you are and that's how I saw your comment you can click on a link to find out what these they're called Google's super chats are and I think the one requirement is you need a thousand subscribers to your channel to be able to do it so you should build up that but once you have that really it just need a webcam and you're good to go a webcam we obviously have something a little bit fancier than that here and as you saw we played some video clips and we have a little bit of a background so Victoria my advice is I don't know what your YouTube channel is but you need to build up to a thousand subscribers first and we're trying it out today and so far no screw-ups it's basically just a live video feed and comments and the odd comment that people chip in for I read another one Pamela King well she should wake up well see let me see one more thing about Angie she I got to tell you and you may not believe me but I like the guy what's not to like a good Saskatchewan boy family man modest living well he sort of it's like Mike Pence in terms of his a personal style but unlike Mike Pence he doesn't have a strong commitment to his ideas enough to lean in to the hurricane and I think that comes from his political experience remember he was elected to Parliament very young he was in his 20s he was one of the youngest MPs and he very quickly became Speaker of the House of Commons when Jason Kenney served when Stephen Harper became prime minister and so when you had to speaker the house you're not going to partisan events you're not typically voting so you're all about compromise and being gentle and splitting the difference and not fighting urethra grundle which I think might be a nickname right - keep up the good work and keep the vids coming I'd like to see another section in rebel about liberal spending budget research and explained more light needs to be sean into the darkness of liberal spending practices well that's a great idea and by the way of urethra is your real first name I apologize for for doubting him one of my our favorite regular guests are our friends from the taxpayers Federation I really like Aaron woodrick he's their Ottowa boss we have Christine Rand guy who's fighting hard in Ontario and I think she's about to have some good news we love their Calgary team awesome Colin Craig and Paige McPherson who's on mat leave so I feel like we have a special friendship with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and I got to say they're the most trustworthy people on this file and they do good research and they're completely nonpartisan they don't take a dime from the government so that's a bit of my ad for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation we should talk to the Fraser Institute more - they do good stuff but I like the tax payer style I think it's because the Fraser Institute is a registered charity so they have to be a little more mild-mannered and the taxpayers Federation is like us they're not a charity they don't have to live under the thumb of bureaucrats so they can be rambunctious and we like that stop by the way I think that this is the era of the taxpayer rising up again just like happened I don't know 20 25 years ago with the GST I think the carbon tax is being a huge rallying cry but as to your specific question having a section on the rebel we're tooling we're retooling our website we're doing it slowly by the way we have for example a an app and it's sort of in beta mode also there's some quirks to it that we're wrinkling out but it's out there and we haven't really advertised it I don't think we've sent out a big email about it I know David Menzies mensis mentions it at the end of his videos a lot but we're trying to tweak things and fix things so I do take your advice we should have a section maybe we'll put that in the next reaming and I see there's not a super chat I'm going to read it Joaquim Jacobson can you turn up the volume sound on the output thank you for that and I just hear in my earpiece that i tech justin has just done that so hopefully that worked and it looks like if I'm reading your Tweaker at your comment correctly you're from Sweden and I thank you for joining us I just as a by the way I have visited Sweden which is something I had never done before and part of me wishes I never did visit Sweden and I'll tell you why because my vision of Sweden before I went there about a year or two ago was so idyllic it was utopian it was everyone beautiful everything beautiful this progressive socialist welfare state where everyone was happy Volvo's Saab Abba happy and when I went there I saw that I'm out of date by about a generation on Sweden there is still that Sweden for sure and there are many wonderful people there in Sweden and I met a lot of them but there's also terrible things going on in Sweden it's got the fastest islamification of all of Europe even more than Germany and because it's so progressive because it's so tolerant because they want to bend over backwards to prove to take the other side of the story they well they bent over backwards so far their spines have shattered and now and I know it's shocking to say but Sweden has one of the highest rapes of rape rates of rape in the world this feminist country I've seen another super chat let me read it Island Ariel has chipped in five dollars thank you very much for that but I don't see a comment there Island Ariel if you if you make another comment I'll look to see if you have anything in particular you want to mention to me I'll keep an eye peeled but back to Sweden I went there and I met a man from who calls him as Lars vixx Vilks excuse me who I won't tell you how I met him because it would give away operational security I had to meet a police officer at a cafe he vetted me and my cameraman then he took us to his waiting police car told us to forget the route we were and we met Lars Vilks in a secure location we had to go through metal detectors I will not say where it was it was shocking and he was in full-time around-the-clock hiding I think it was worse than what salman rushdie cuz summer rush he goes out and about we had to be vetted by police in a public space before we went into the police car to meet Lars Vilks can you believe that just because he criticized radical Islam I met another other Swedes who I think he would call them liberal Swedes and Danes there just across the bridge from each other there Denmark and Sweden Malmo on the other side there from Copenhagen these are liberal people who I think twenty years ago would have called themselves liberals or even leftists or certainly they use the word progressive and simply for speaking out for separation of mosque and state and women's rights they're literally the subject of assassination attempts Lars Hedegaard I think that's another gentleman I'm going from memory told me about the assassination attempt on his life and that is happening it's grenade attacks in Sweden that are so common they don't even make the news anymore I went to a neighbor I did I see a new super chat let me just hop off this little tangent to take a look at that I want it I want to respect your questions if you're asking me questions on the super channel want answers Viking insane says concerned about Canada's cultural heritage the Liberals have ditched our nation's founder from the $10 bill in to glorify victimhood instead well that's certainly what Trudeau does isn't it and that's the liberal way that's Trudeau and that's his father also from changing our flag to changing our anthem they want to zero things out have things have if they could they would say it's not 2018 they would restart the zero year at I don't know Pierre Trudeau's election or maybe the Charter of Rights as if we didn't have a history in a tradition before that Canada did have quite a rich tradition both a French and in English tradition both of which are very in both of which we can learn from both of which have a lot of Liberty in their history and rule of law and tradition and I think throwing them out in the name of multiculturalism creates a void and it's so strange to hear Justin Trudeau talk about that he often talks about that to foreign media more than he does to Canadian media doesn't he he said I mean I don't have the quotes in front of me because I wasn't expecting that question but he says that Canada has no underlying identity as if we're just some airport hotel or something tomorrow I'll be someone else in the room the next day someone else that's not true that's not true and the reason that people come to Canada is not for our cold weather it's not for the climate it's in part because Trudeau has thrown open the doors to the welfare state now and a lot of people are self reporting from Donald Trump's America seriously Haitians Salvadorians these are not people who typically come to Canada but Trump's kicking them out so Canada's taking them in yeah people come here because we got a sucker as a prime minister but people who choose to migrate here lawfully do so because they like the essence of our country the essence of our country in Canada is the same as yes since in America or similar it's not the weather it's not then wrong resources under the ground it's not it's not even the geography it's our culture it's our culture and my culture I don't mean race and I don't even mean religion although our religion does underpin our culture obviously it's where the 10 commandments comes from it's where our notions of mercy and charity come from and I think what's fascinating we send our friend David Menzies out to do Streeters and once in a while I get out and do Streeters too and and whenever we talk to new Canadians about immigration the hardest line people are new immigrants especially visible minorities and I think the reason is first of all they came in the proper way and they're mad at the queue jumpers second of all they don't want the bad apples giving them a name if you're a newcomer from a foreign country and bad apples come from your country here you don't want your name to be tarnished by that that's I have a lot of Sikh friends who are really mad at Rudolph for hanging out with that convicted terrorist jazz Paul Atwal because they're saying answer that's not us that's not the Sikh community and I know that I know that but Trudeau has emphasized that part of the Sikh community a miniscule part but the final reason I think visible minorities are the hardest line on immigration when we find them in Streeters you know what I mean Vox Pop just talk to people in the street because they're not afraid of being called racist when you're an immigrant from the Caribbean or whatnot you're not worried about some liberal journalist misconstruing it so you say frankly vet them don't let the terrorists and don't let the troublemakers in that's my favorite thing about doing Streeters in Toronto is talking to the new Canadians they are culturally more conservative than Justin Trudeau I'm glancing at the web the clock here it's 1249 I've been talking for 49 minutes straight which is normally what I call a warm up just a reminder of what we're doing here today it's the first time we're doing it just over 400 people watching we didn't announce this we don't even think we tweeted about it we we didn't email people we just sort of snuck it in we're trying it out it's called astral advance battleground I like to battle things every day today I battled the White House Correspondents Dinner and there to call our comedians is stretches that word beyond his plasticity it was an unfunny comedian taking a run and every woman who works around Donald Trump and then going on a little ad for Planned Parenthood that was pretty gross so yeah it's called ezreal events battleground because I battle but you can battle with me and I frankly was expecting a few more hostile comments in the super chat me to say how it works super-sized you can see on the right-hand side of the screen there's a there's a constant stream of comments and I'm glancing at them this one from what king jacobson again see that's called a super chat if you kick in a couple bucks or 20 Swedish kronor you could have your comment really highlighted and then it stays on the screen for me to look at so as what kim says as you said Sweden has changed beyond recognition so I see out of the corner of my eye because you can see my screen says see out of the corner Meyer when that bright collar comes on so I go in and read those super chats the rest of the time I'm talking to camera so this pod can call you a video podcast it'll be available every day after it's live so it's gonna be live from noon until 1:00 if we keep going with it I mean let me know let me know if you think it's worth doing I mean I I could do other things with my day but I'm having a little bit of fun and we'll make it available for a regular podcast without the video I don't think you're gonna lose that much we had some video clips five clips from the White House Correspondents Dinner but it's it's not that much and like I say if you really want to get something to me this is a way to do it and by the way I expected more criticism I mean maybe I should maybe I should look you have many many fans as here we know you are no hater thanks Jonathan the Green Knight I can abuse you if you like Ezra well I shouldn't say yes to that but if you have a tough question go ahead and put it I I like to think that we're fairly transparent here we don't always get it right I mean I was just looking at our YouTube channel today we have we've published more than 8,000 videos in our three years and I don't know what's that 20,000 written stories to accompany them so you're not gonna get it right every time even if you're getting irate 99% of time that's 80 screw-ups every media company gets it wrong sometimes especially if you're colouring outside the lines a little bit I mean we're not called the establishment we're called the rabble our talent is rebellious we're a little bit prickly a little bit crotchety and so yeah we're gonna we're going to be a bit rough probably more often than the vanilla pablum of the mainstream media my main beef with the mainstream media is not its left-wing you tilt it's its sheer boringness and sameness wouldn't you agree in some ways I find a greater fraternity with left-wing alternative media than I do with the mainstream media that's more moderate let me read some more and these are not the super chat ones I'm just reading randomly Jonathan Bryant we need an Atlantic Canadian reporter you're right you know I reached out to my old friend Chris Simms who used to be based in the Atlantic but I she's moved over the Taxpayers Federation I got to know her at Sunday she was just great I want someone like that really grassroots really connected to the land and that laying again face at Justin Trudeau supports worldwide terrorism with our tax dollars well I don't know of any direct links like that other than giving money to Hamas run Gaza which of course Hamas is a terrorist organization so I take your point the researcher says what do you think regarding the low birth rate in the West is feminists in one of its causes well of course feminism is one of its cause is when people delay marriage much longer when women choose to work instead of to be moms there's going to be a lower birth rate that's not even a question I think the the question is is that good is it bad what are the pros and cons so I don't even think that's a question I mean and it's been going on for longer than just a few years I mean the advent of the birth control pill did that I think a lot of women are questioning who won that battle of the sexes I mean we're women liberated or were men more liberated from their responsibility having consequence free sex it's something that a lot of thoughtful people that christina hoff sommers talked about and even our friend barbara kay by the way I love having Barbara Kay as a as a guest on my evening show every day and he 8 p.m. I do is show behind the paywall but she did some videos for us and if you go on our YouTube page search for Barbara Kay's video on The Mary Tyler Moore Show which was a hot show in the 70s versus girls that awful awful show by Lena Dunham I did not think I would find that an interesting video because it was a very female centric story and old timey Mary Tyler Moore but I found it so riveting and so touching and very thought-provoking and a little bit sad also I recommend that if you if you haven't seen that all right let me read a few more ins 12:55 we got five more minutes if you want to get your super chat chat in there now's the time to do it Greg Wade low birth rates due to education and people being told for you that it is irresponsible to have lots of children well that's true I mean I hate there's a there really is an anti child narrative out there you see it in so many of these clickbait sites like BuzzFeed vice they're really anti parenting there's a snobbery there that their jobs are better than the job of being a month and I and there's it's not just a choice anymore like I said earlier pro-choice people on abortion typically say abortion is safe legal and rare but that Michelle Fox the comedian was pro-abortion it's different than I would say the same about choosing women having the right to choose I support women having the right obviously to choose to be in the world of work but the demonization of women who make the other choice that's the analogy I'm making with Michelle Fox demonizing the baby that's aborted as opposed to saying it's a choice alright four minutes left in the podcast today I think well you know we'll do a little post-mortem here afterwards and see if it was worth doing I thought it was fun it's an hour of my time I mean I don't do a lot of prep in advance I just chose the five clips today as you can see I can talk to hind leg off a horse one last question from what keen Jacobson what I have seen no one in Sweden wants to get children when the country has been dismantled well looking let me close with an anecdote and again if you want to see this video a couple years ago I went to Sweden there went to Malmo which is the city right across from Copenhagen mamo a generation ago was a hard-working industrial town blue-collar the shipbuilding reminds me of Hamilton Ontario shipbuilding is gone though and the new industry there is refugees and I know that sounds crazy what kind of industry is that well social workers welfare police crime drugs I hate to say that's what it is and to see for myself I went to a neighborhood in Malmo called Rosengard which used to be sort of a student housing complex I think that's what it was told to me is a guy who took us there it's 99% Muslim now in this neighborhood I mean Malmo is about half Muslim but it's not Muslim house Christian house Muslim else Krishna says there's a Muslim section and a Christian section and Rosengard is 19 employ let me put it this way I one non-muslim civilian there the entire track Uppal of security guards who were not Muslim I saw one white Swedish woman and I saw her after spending the entire day there by the gate away we had some pretty heavy-duty security because like I said stabbing I mean and and you could see we were being eyeballed by sort of Watchmen and people following us and who were they and they there to make trouble honor the police coming in anyways I met this one Swedish woman and I went up to her and I said how do you feel this is you know the Sweden you grew up and is completely gone and to hear her series of talking points first she said well we need people we Swedes are not having enough kids we need people to take care of us and I pointed out that most of these refugees were not working that Swedes were in fact taking care of them she moved on to the next talking point in the next talking point well we have a duty to help them oh I thought you just said this was for them to help you well what about when communities like Malmo become majority Muslim and they start taking Swedish values out and putting Sharia values in I interviewed Muslim Malmo citizens born in Sweden who are calling for Sharia law so what happens when 50 60 70 % of the population of Malmo believes in Sharia law and I'd say right now it's coming up on half she said and I asked her that I said is there any limit to the number of refugees Sweden can take she said no I said well what happens when they changed the laws and it's no longer Swedish how what happens when they changed the country's name why would it stay called why would he called Sweden I mean they changed the name Constantinople to Istanbul why would it be called sweet and she said oh well as long as we have our beautiful nature it's still fine it was the most pitiful conversation I ever had frankly well folks that's the close of our one hour test run beta test try it out of this Google super chat and what do you think I was super chatty you guys were sort of chatty I I think I got through about 10 comments I think I read all the super chats thanks to those of you who chipped in for that I think you know I feel like it went pretty well let me know what you think put your put your comments there did you think it's worth doing would you tune in again we had before I think we maxed out about 450 people listening which you know we could do a lot better if we if we advertised in advance I didn't you know it's sort of I was a little bit chicken I thought maybe we'd have some technical problems we hadn't done it before it was sort of new I think it works I think it worked out okay I'd like to do it I mean I like chatting for an hour you know it takes a little bit of time out of my day but it's worth it let me know leave your comments here and if you agree with me that I think it went okay I'll see you again tomorrow I'll cover a story like I did today with the White House Correspondents Dinner I'll try and bring some vids I'll try and bring some more photos and websites and stuff and maybe I'll call for them in real time from our producers there I like the fact that we ran some clips but other than that I think I'd say not a bad soft launch that's it for me I'm answer live and I'm the rebel commander here at the rebel dot media you've been watching Ezra Lantz battleground until tomorrow at 12:00 noon Eastern goodbye and hey you keep fighting - see ya
