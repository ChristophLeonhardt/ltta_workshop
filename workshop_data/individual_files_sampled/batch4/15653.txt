we're all our freakin night-vision goggles on like NSF and we can't freakin control these dudes wearing freaking robes and chocolates because we got a bunch of dumb so think about the people who you know where you're pretty stupid Uncle Louie or whatever their dumb that articulate fellow bashing the men and woman who fight to uphold his right to criticize them was Gregory Salcido who is a high school history teacher City Councilman and three-time mayor of Pico Rivera a city in you guessed it California so the implication here is that academic people you know the ones indoctrinating our youth into thinking with their feelings instead of facts aren't the lowest of our low and I'm sure mr. Salcido knows all about talent trashing your Guardians some of the bravest strongest and most technically proficient people in the country behind their backs to a bunch of kids sure does take a lot of talent integrity and courage anyway the teacher and Councilman proceeded to shame an unnamed student for wearing a military shirt so he scoffs at military service is some sort of legal prostitution and we just heard him say he didn't think soldiers made bad moral decisions I hope Salcido doesn't need to enroll in any essay writing or debate classes anytime soon but this isn't the first time the teacher has made headlines in 2010 Salcido allegedly told his student shut up Kelly before I kill you preached about gay marriage and criticized the military and religion and probably not the religion of peace I think it's safe to assume al Rancho high school put him on leave for a month during the summer session and hey you can't blame them further discipline might have resulted in a bit less dough from the city where Salcido was mayor at the time Salcedo apparently blends traditional teaching methods with unconventional ones and called his lessons intense well I guess that's one way to put it the teachers rant marks the latest in a slew of very compelling arguments for Cal exit it used to be mostly Bernie and Hillary supporters that supported the states seceding from the Union but I'm willing to give it a shot I used to worry that without the military Kim Jong and the other world despots will see California as a target ripe for a few missiles but the wise Salcido has informed us that the military is the talentless lowest of our low so I'm sure the state will be just fine for campus and mast I'm Rob shim Shaw if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm you
