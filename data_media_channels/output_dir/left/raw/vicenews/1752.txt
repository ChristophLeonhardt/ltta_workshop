00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">for one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest turn arounds of</font>

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,820
Riker's it reduced violent incidents by

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,530
umpteen percent how many from 93 prime

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,259
to three percent you instituted a lot of

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,870
policies and reforms that turned Rikers

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,020
Island around right what happened why

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,830
didn't it stick it didn't stick because

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,199
they removed all the programs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put</font>

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,900
in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program's of accountability</font>

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,500
for staff for managers how do you have a

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,780
circumstance in a facility where you

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,329
have an actual wedding being catered in

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,829
a jail in Manhattan it's it's it's a

15
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,809
jail somebody allowed a caterer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,690
in to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facility and have a wedding</font>

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then there was a Bar Mitzvah four</font>

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,360
months later how do you have a

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,050
circumstance where you have a fight

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,789
clubs so to speak that's what it was

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">called by the by the New York tabloids</font>

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,250
where correction officers are pitting

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,659
inmates against other inmates to the

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,030
point that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beat-down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,400
inmate and he's murdered he's beat to

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,759
death under the supervision of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">correction officers you know it's</font>

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,509
insanity if you cut someone you take a

29
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,360
razor blade and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you / up a guy and cut</font>

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,579
them to shreds you got charged<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

31
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,079
crime well they<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that why</font>

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,180
why you create an atmosphere question

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,540
why would they change those policies and

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,369
it's all about accountability and

35
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,880
leadership I took an agency that was the

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,430
most violent and mismanaged agency

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,280
Correctional Facility in this country

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,780
and turned it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into an international</font>

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">model for efficiency accountability and</font>

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,750
safety and today<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's right back where</font>

41
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,020
it was before I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have</font>

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,350
half the inmates half the inmates the

43
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,050
population today is 10,000 their daily

44
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,920
average population I

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,349
over 22,000 so I can't understand why

46
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,270
someone would let that revert is that

47
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,880
political is it just because of because

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,620
those reforms are tied to your legacy

49
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,069
and uh that's what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is yeah</font>

50
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,020
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it is and I don't</font>

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I don't know I can't answer those</font>

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,100
questions but I honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

53
00:02:30,100 --> 00:00:00,000
what it is
