there is a Republican congressional candidate from the third District in Illinois and he is going unchallenged meaning that there is no one who will run against him in the Republican primary in that district in that state his name is Arthur Jones and the reason why he's making headlines is because he is a disgusting human being he openly denies the Holocaust happened in fact his campaign website features a page called Holocaust that includes a type note calling the murder of six million Jews by Nazis quote the biggest blackest lie in history and falsely claiming there is no proof of the Holocaust beyond a few professional concentration camp survivors okay so again no Republican is challenging him so he is set to win the Republican ticket and this has caused quite a bit of an issue for the Republican Party there have been members of the Republican Party who have come out and you know basically said that they don't agree with him they don't like him they don't want anything to do with him but what stood out to me the most is how much this type of rhetoric has become normalized in fact he granted an interview to a local reporter in Chicago and I want to hear I want you to hear what he had to say about the issue of the Holocaust take a look economic policies of Hitler brought that nation up for the very bottom and twelve years of his rule they went from the age of the biplane to the age of the rocket I designed a huge ad that full-page has appeared Milwaukee Journal newspaper full-page but a huge swastika right in the center of the thing and the Jews had no idea you know that was coming okay and imagine you're some rabbi he hooked up the paper one morning also bringing over who may join the America first committee membership in this organization is open to any white American system European non Jewish descent to me the Holocaust is what I said it is it's an international extortion racket the green red and black flag of the black militants that's their goal they want to take over the Southland and drive the white people out and take it over and create a black nation right there so uh his campaign includes the slogan it's time to put America first gee I wonder where he got that from also he ran for office back in 2016 and he expressed his support for Trump's candidacy back then but his only concern was that Trump's daughter Ivanka is married to a Jew that was his quote but now he says that he actually regrets voting for Trump because the president has quote surrounded himself with hordes of Jews this guy is despicable yes like there's there's someone out there who is actually significantly worse than Trump like it's amazing yeah so the America first slogan and Trump also has actually originally was used by the America first committee and who were they it was an anti-semitic non interventionist group from World War two who thought we should not fight the Nazis and that's why the anti-defamation league asked Trump not to use the slogan America first because of its dark history here in America and Trump was like yeah whatever man no I'm gonna use it don't care yeah I think that's relevant right because it's it's one I mean look it's one thing if you play devil's advocate and you say okay well maybe Trump just didn't know America first by itself as a phrase isn't you know questionable phrase but then once you look into the history and you know that where it comes from you would think he'd stop using it if he's not you know the person that we know he is and and he continued using it doesn't care an America first does not have any other connotation there there isn't like oh but America first was also known for this right no it was only known in that context so you know look one party has folks like Arthur Jones another party doesn't that doesn't make the other party wonderful and angelic and both parties have corruption and we should fight against the corruption in both parties but if you're a white supremacist it is very clear which party you're gonna go to there was another blogger who was denying the Holocaust who was brought to the State of the Union by Matt Gaetz Republican congressman and and openly bragging about it so these are dark times and in Charlottesville they not only ran over Heather hire and and all the other people who were injured after they were doing their white supremacist rally but in the story you might not have heard some of the Nazis had surrounded Jewish temple in Charlottesville and and people were trapped inside they were calling the police but the police were busy and they were really scared they were trying to figure out a way to get the Torah and other things out of the temple without the Nazis catching them and the Nazis were shutting this is an America this is a Charlottesville Virginia in the year 2017 and they were chanting blood and Saura blood and soil outside their temple these are very scary times so now it doesn't mean that every Republican is Arthur Jones but when Arthur Jones thinks which party am I going to go to that's a no-brainer right and again you know to their credit there are Republicans who are coming out and speaking against Arthur Jones and what he's saying but it's it is fascinating that they can't find another Republican to take part in the primary it is what it is and and I do want to be clear it's highly unlikely that Arthur Jones is going to win it's more likely that the representative that's the current incumbent who's a Democrat is going to win his name is dan Lipinski by the way Dan Lopez he might not even survive a primary by Mary Newman who's given him a run for his money and she should that leads me to about my final point in my frustration with the Democratic Party which is totally different scale and context but dan Lipinski they say oh don't worry about arthur jones you can't possibly win that's such a heavily Democratic district then why is Dan land piss you on the most conservative Democrats in the country representing a district that according to all experts Democrats could not possibly we lose so then why don't we have a really progressive person representing that district instead of a guy who is deeply conservative they would the Republicans allow that anywhere where you have a deeply read district you're like but let's have a liberal Republican there instead never right so why do they democratic party a you know he not only tolerate dan Lipinski but encouraged him time and time again cuz they don't care about being progressive all they care about is the money is can dan Lipinski raise a lot of money from his corporate friends yes then they're like good enough he calls himself a Democrat what do we care how we votes because the Democratic Party doesn't care about policy so the Republicans they think some loathsome things but they but a lot of them care about policy they care about pushing the country a more right-wing yeah their policy is horrible and the Democrats refusal to fight for their policy beliefs is also horrible again different scale and context right but that's the problem with the parties and and look to be fair Republicans don't care about being identified as corporatists right so they'll okay revel in it exactly so they will openly propose pro corporate policies and they can push for it because their voters know what they really represent whereas Democrats have the same issue of corporate corruption but they pretend like they don't and then they try to distract with social issues it's constantly social issues one less fun fact Jose thinks of the Confederate flag is a symbol of white pride and white resistance how's that working out for you I think we beat those guys pretty bad so if you think you're resisting I got bad news for you all those states are in the Union they're part of the United States of America and your so-called white resistance failed miserably if you liked this video bless your
