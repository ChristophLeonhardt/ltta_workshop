Donald Trump's fixer Michael Cohen is now doing what no personal lawyer for a president has ever done while the president was in office pleading the fifth Michael Cohen says based on advice of counsel this is in the stormy Daniels case I will assert my Fifth Amendment in connection with all proceedings in this case president's personal attorney is pleading the fifth in the stormy Daniels case how was your day seeing it written out this way in black and white in a court filing it is a good reminder of how much legal jeopardy the president's personal attorney seems to be in now that legal jeopardy that's not just an interpretation of events because you cannot automatically plead the fifth in a civil case and get away with it unless you can demonstrate legal jeopardy which Cohen just asserted and as we reported a night a judge just accepted now I want to be clear and I've said this before even if it's a little annoying Cohen has a right under our Constitution to protect himself against self-incrimination pleading the fifth does not confer guilt in fact as we all know from pop culture some people even do it gleefully I plead the fifth I'm pleading the fifth until I speak to my lawyer on the advice of counsel I must respectfully decline to answer your question based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution I plead the fifth did he tell you where he was on the day McAllister was murdered I plead the fifth you have the right to do that but even a fair-minded legal experts note that there is no implied guilt and exercising that right let's be clear tonight not everyone applies that standard in fact Michael Cohen's move means he is failing Donald Trump's own standard that was Donald Trump's knock against Hillary Clinton aides some of whom did plead the fifth and the email probe and Trump aids invoked that in their campaign one of those aides of course has now pled guilty to his own crime of lying to the feds another still works at the White House but was blasting Clinton aides in the probe as Liars that was then but I can tell you tonight there's even more here because even though federal rules bar juries from looking at a defendant negatively for pleading the fifth it doesn't mean that pleading the fifth is always okay or an innocent move take President Nixon who was ultimately busted for advising his aides to plead the fifth as yes part of the Watergate cover-up he told his aides and this is a quote I want you all the Stone wallet let them plead the fifth amendment cover-up or anything else if it'll save it that's the plan that's the whole point the whole point and at first Nixon's White House Counsel his lawyer John Dean did exactly that in a watergate grand jury was just three months after getting the advice I just read he later conceded that was partly an effort to save himself at others expenses but even pleading the fifth has its limits if there's a cover-up in fact it only protects incrimination when there's an effort to incriminate you so what if you get immunity aka the word of the week what if you flip well John Dean got that he flipped in dramatic fashion publicly incriminating his boss and his former client Richard Nixon I concluded by saying this is going to take continued perjury and continued support of these individuals to perpetuate the cover-up that is lawyers speak for obstruction of justice which is a crime that people do time for president's lawyer there John Dean faced a fork in the road that does test many criminal conspirators do you want to risk everything to protect your boss or at some point do you look out for yourself hey they're armed Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
