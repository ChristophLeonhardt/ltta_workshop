Charles Merrill was just so important in Wall Street in the sense of bringing individual investors into the market when he started his firm the original Merrill Lynch it was very different from its approach to individual investors than the other firms the firms before Merrill Lynch the individual investor what we call the business retail investors often looked upon as sheep to be shorn Charles Merrill instituted very ethical approach to dealing with the retail investor that nobody nobody else had done that before investigated then invest that was the Byward of Merrill Lynch back in those days he also did something kind of radically different on Wall Street he compensated the the salespeople not on a commission basis but on a salary basis and that was done just to give confidence to the investors and well-placed confidence because the idea that broker was was to be a counselor putting the best interests of the customer first that subject has has reemerged very recently in the Obama administration his Department of Labor now has instituted rules for how sales are made and how the decisions are made on what is appropriate for customers there's a tougher standard there where the broker really becomes a fiduciary and guess what that that all goes back to Charles Merrill's philosophy
