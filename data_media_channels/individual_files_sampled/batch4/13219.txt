a Charla france-presse is now reporting that rising us start Issa Rae held up her hand up Wednesday to sexualizing men in her hit television series insecure saying it was time for the female gays to have its day okay he's being like Gaz e not like the female gays like Ellen DeGeneres like the female gays to have its day the african-american writer and producer who first broke through playing herself in the cult youtube series awkward black girl admitted she was all for the camera lingering longer on the glories of the naked male okay so a couple of things so she says men are more sexualized in the series because we are seeing this through the female lens she says when I'm in the act myself I don't take a look at my body you're seeing what I see what I'm looking at it's all very intentional we're always seeing bleep and bleep on TNA on screen this is an opportunity to reverse that she says that her mom who's a good Christian hates the show should the bad language the sex she'll say why did I even bother with parental control and having you not watch r-rated movies if you grow up to make the things you weren't allowed to watch she said that she's basically making porn what I think is hilarious about this and she says it's time for women to sexualize men yeah well I thought the critique was that men were sexualizing women and that was bad I mentioned treat women as pieces of meat so I guess now the reverse is that women should sexualize men and treat them as pieces of meat there's a difference however when women are sexualized by men and treated as pieces of meat they don't like it it is one of the great objections they correct objections or the me2 movement don't treat me like a piece of meat don't sexualize me don't treat me as though I'm just a sexual object fair enough correct how do you men react to being sexualized if a woman says to a man I really want to see you naked there is not a man on earth who's upset about this sentence yeah like really this isn't that men do not operate in the same way that women do and only idiot radical feminists think differently if a man says to a woman in a bar I want to see you naked she is insulted and throws a drink in his face if a woman says to a man in a bar I want to see you naked the man says okay where do we go that's really how that goes hey there's a 1989 study it's still my favorite social science study ever is a 1989 study in which these college professors sent an attractive woman into a bar to ask a hundred men whether they wanted to home with her for the night 75 of the 100 men said yes hey then the the same study authors sent a man into the bar to ask a hundred women whether they wanted to go home for the night how many women said yes zero zero so when people went when radical feminists are like it's time for us to start sexualizing men better like go for it man we've been waiting for this for generations they go go for it but again if you're convincing women that you are somehow acting in equality demand it's gonna work out well for you it ain't gonna work out well for you okay it's not going to work out well for you because it turns out you'll just be used and abused by a bunch of men and in the end you are not acting authentically the way that you actually feel about sex you are acting as people are telling you to feel about sex and that means that you are probably going to feel emotionally empty afterward now maybe there are some people who are very into the casual sex and they like to sexualize men and everything works out great I'm not talking to you and I really mean you like it's one person I'm talking about all the other women on planet Earth who attach emotional intimacy to sex because there's other studies that demonstrate that women have better sex in emotionally intimate situations sex with strangers does not work the same way for men and women because this is what evolution teaches us again this is not me subjectively trying to promulgate my traditionalist views on sex on women evolutionary biology is not in favor of women having random promiscuous sex with strangers it leads to the genetic offspring of idiots really this is why women are more sexually selective than men and this is true in every sexually dimorphic species basically so it's again go for it you want to do this all you enjoy but let's not pretend that this is in any way going to forward the the enjoyment or happiness of women it's really really asinine
