1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:05,460
Brazil is at a turning point experts are
calling this the most important

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,719
presidential election in Brazil's
history in the first round of voting a

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,490
field of 13 candidates was narrowed down
to two Fernando Haddad represents the

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,060
leftist Workers Party which has been in
power for much of the past two decades

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,550
but with only 29 percent of the vote
he's by far the underdog it's far right

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,990
candidate Jo Boston ro that has gripped
the nation's attention with 46 percent

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,560
of the vote he's favored to become
Brazil's next president which would mark

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,760
a dramatic shift in the country's
politics that's because Boston ro is a

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,600
longtime congressman who is known for
his ultra conservative and deeply

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:54,170
offensive rhetoric his rhetoric has
sparked widespread protests and outrage

11
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,859
it's become so bad that at a campaign
rally the candidate was stabbed by a man

12
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,989
claiming he was on a mission from God
but despite the backlash Boston ro has

13
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,090
drawn huge crowds to his rallies and
skyrocketed to the top of the polls so

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,080
how did this relatively unknown
congressman garner so much support and

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,270
what does this mean for Brazil's
democracy

16
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,259
Brazil hasn't been a democracy for long
the country was ruled by a military

17
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:33,220
regime from 1964 to 1985 it was an era
marked by violence torture exile and

18
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,700
censorship it was during this military
regime that Jo Boston ro began his

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,380
career as an army captain when the
regime fell in 1985 and Brazil became a

20
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,479
democracy Boston ro entered politics as
a staunch far-right conservative

21
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,409
eventually becoming a congressman for
Rio de Janeiro

22
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,310
he served seven terms in Congress but
remained controversial because of his

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:04,959
extremist remarks and he continued to
show an affinity for the military

24
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,709
dictatorship just look at these photos
in his congressional office the

25
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,940
portraits on the wall are presidents
from Brazil's military regime as a

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,620
presidential candidate Boston ro hasn't
changed he openly calls for bringing

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:26,350
back some of the military regimes

problema Samata dice keys of each
country that children don't anything is

29
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,209
here cool the core of this process in
fact Boston ro has picked a retired Army

30
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,380
General as his running mate who has
openly suggested that a military coup

31
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,180
could be a possibility who calls
racing-style advice see I leave I say

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,609
Josh my dad just was so much egq so for
this time though that pro-military

33
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,350
message has struck a chord

34
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,110
for many Brazilians particularly the
young voters in Boston aerospace the

35
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,120
military regime's brutality has faded
into history instead Boston Aras praise

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,230
of the Armed Forces has resonated with
his supporters at a time when crime has

37
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,560
been soaring in the country in 2016
Brazil's homicide rate was nearly six

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,970
times that of the u.s. in a country that
shares borders with some of the biggest

39
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,230
cocaine producing countries in the world
much of Brazil's violence stems from

40
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,730
drug gang rivalries mismanagement of
Public Security funds by government

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,959

underpaid and under prepared to deal

42
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,889
with the mounting violence Boston aras
pro-military stance has made him a

43
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,760
champion of law and order for many even
though his rhetoric calls back to a

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:56,599
brutal dictatorship Boston ro is seen as
a solution for a country in crisis say

48
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,450
scandal in its history in Boston ro has
capitalized on that too

49
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,790
for weeks Brazil has been consumed by
allegations of corruption and bribery at

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,780
the highest level involving politicians
and business leaders a massive

60
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,340
one of the pivotal votes for Rousseff's
impeachment in 2016 when he openly

61
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,330
dedicated his vote to an army colonel
accused of widespread torture and

62

murders during brazil's dictatorship

63
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,090
the corruption scandal also helped
Boston ro by removing his strongest

opponent in the presidential race

70

Fernando Haddad belongs to the same
party as Lula

71
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,479
but he hasn't drawn the same level of
support in part because of the increase

72
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,930
in crime and rampant corruption the
public's faith in the government has

73
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,490
eroded over the years their trust in
Congress the presidency the Supreme
