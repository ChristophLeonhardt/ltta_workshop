adding a warm welcome isn't always a
pleasant experience especially if it's
in the form of an unwanted hug as one
Californian senator learned the hard way
you are now noticed that your behavior
has been unwelcome the Rules Committee
also instructs you not to initiate hugs
all my life a hug has been my way of
greeting friends and colleagues a
gesture of warmth and kindness and a
reflection of my exuberance
