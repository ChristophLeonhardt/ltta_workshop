when your wife walks in and she sees a

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,480
the laundry and the irony I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,949

21
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,040
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they both need done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um unless</font>

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,850
priority but that would be a really good

25
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,570
gift for your wife a third on the list

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,780
would be doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> home-cooked meal off</font>

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,939
for her you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know having the dishes all</font>

whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bedtime thing with them so that</font>

36
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,350
your wife has time just to relax and

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,780
unwind that she can like put her feet up

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,869
and read a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> or she could go on</font>

39
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,600
facebook she can check out Canadian

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,950
give your wife time to relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unwind</font>

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,440

massage but keep in mind that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

52
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,440
to know what your wife likes if she

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,930
enjoys that kind of thing then go for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

54
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,360
she will appreciate it and love it and

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,190
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great gift for her and</font>

56
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,950
it's free of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but if she</font>

57
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,360
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing because</font>

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,280
for me personally I don't like being

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,020

60
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,590
feet what do you think you're doing so I

61
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,670
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that kind of thing so</font>

62
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would not be a good gift um but you</font>

63
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,830
know a cuddle and watching a chick flick

64
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,170
would be what I would pick I'm instead

65
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,240
of that because I would do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any day</font>

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,330
so that would be another one and I'm

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,800
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say this I know it's not</font>
