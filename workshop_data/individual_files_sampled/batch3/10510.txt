two astronauts are no doubt thanking their lucky stars right now after successfully escaping they failed launch of their Soyuz spacecraft on Thursday the booster rocket malfunctioned just minutes into their flight causing them to abort and return to Earth after a dramatic rescue and medical tests there was relief from friends and family as they were welcome back to Baikonur yeah you can just imagine how those hugs felt well the crew arrived a little bit earlier today at the Star City training center located just outside Moscow Artie's Maria finocchiona is there for us Star City OHS was near a dock in Russian is where Russian cosmonaut Alexei of Cheney has been training for months and months preparing for his second mission to the International Space Station now he and another crew member American astronaut and Nick Hague right now here after their lucky escape as they call it the emergency landing in Kazakhstan they will be checked here for the next 48 hours we hear from the doctors that BOE spaceman feel very well right now both physically and psychologically but the protocol requires that they the health conditions are monitored for the next two days we know that some family members are also here of course a very warm welcome but the question many now want to know the answer to is exactly what happened on Thursday criminal case was launched and as paschal high-profile state commission was also formed to shed the light on the cause of the incident on Thursday we hear that the heads of NASA and European Space Agency already offered their assistance help in investigation we expect the first results by October 24th already now we hear that separation system malfunction might be cause of collision again this is just preliminary suggestion the head of man programs in russian space agency Roscosmos mr. krikalev provided more on what is happening right now Commission the Commission has started its work the first rocket fragments have already been found and the results are expected by the 20th of October our systems will help analyze the reasons for what happened until the exact cause of the incident is found all the space flights must be suspended but a very good news for both Alex F Chinon in ne Hague we hear from the head of Russian Rose cosmas that they will fly to the International Space Station next spring already we are back in Star City these guys will fly we plan for their flight to be in the spring of next year just to remind you what happened everything appeared to be going very well with the launch but less than two minutes into the flight a problem was reported with the booster rocket between the first and second stages separating and the emergency escape system immediately reacted to this automatically by separating the crew capsule and Alexei have Keenan and Nick Hague safely landed inside this capsule several hundred kilometers from the launch site in Kazakhstan so it is very important right now to be careful in investigating and in answering the question exactly what caused this incident well the crew onboard the International Space Station where the Soyuz was hoping to get to had more than a bird's-eye view of what happened and captured the moment on camera just take a look at this the breathtaking images were taken by the current space station commander Alexander Gerst he and his team were readying to of course welcome their colleagues and board but could then only watch helplessly as they saw the astronauts incredible escape as they fell back to earth even four hundred kilometers up commander Gerst relief was palpable I'm glad that our friends are fine thanks to more than thousand rescue workers this day has again shown how great this is is despite a false start the crew was safely brought back to earth space travel is tough but we must go on for the benefit of humanity well when you've got more than half a million pounds of burning rocket fuel behind you and a booster that's gone faulty you need to get away and fast for Thursday's Soyuz crew that meant relying on a scaped system first developed in the 1960s it's a very dangerous situation and it's impressive about the design of how they built this the escape system that it works so very well but you're in a very volatile situation with lots of rocket propellant around you going very very fast very very high so things could have gone much much worse and it's just great that the escape system works so well well every moment of the brief tense flight was being closely watched rock usnea takes us through what occurred Baikonur cosmodrome 14 40 local time liftoff in five four three two one the launch is always the most nerve-wracking part the energy and stress involved the colossal rise of the risks and dangers at this time everything proceeding as intended for today's flight yeah the two-minute mark the first-stage boosters begin to separate something goes wrong there's no time to wait or think at 121 seconds emergency protocols engage automatically the mission is compromised there are milliseconds to get the crew away the families of the crew the heads of Ross cosmos and NASA watch honours the ejection system jettisons the crew module away from the rocket boosters before the tons of high explosive fuel detonate and we have the escape tower for the Soyuz now jettisoned the ballistic trajectory thereon is rougher than anticipated the crew is shaken and battered but stay conscious with room for a little humor three minutes in emergency systems function as intended they begin their descent back to earth within minutes a search and rescue operation is underway helicopters are soon airborne powering towards the landing site while Alexey NICs families pray and hope i watched the launch on TV and then i got the news from my neighbor's you can understand my feelings at the time it was hard there's no telling what medical condition the crew are in what we might call luck others would call professionalism a crew who trained for years for this the technicians who engineered the safety overrides the rescuers and medics who arrived in record time Ross cosmos NASA teams it wasn't a miracle but it was the next best thing when it comes to space nothing is left to chance there's contingencies for everything fail-safes protocols and provisions there's checks double checks triple checks and choices track record the best in the world proves it's as safe as can be but that only gets you so far space is after all the final frontier yeah plenty people fascinating by what unfolding cluding former astronauts that we spoke to they said that crews are always well prepared for such emergencies and praised of Chinon and Hague for their quick thinking actions flew to the space station aboard a Soyuz rocket myself came back in the Soyuz capsule on my fourth mission and so you know kind of brought me back to what it's like being in that vehicle and imagining going through this kind of an emergency abort but as you heard from the transmissions the crew was very calm very professional and they did everything exactly right and so first and foremost of course we're all very pleased that the crew was safe and healthy they were able to walk away from the from the landing site and now it's just a matter of the investigation to determine what happened what corrective action needs to be taken and then recertifying the vehicles for launch this was a situation that the crew were very well prepared for often it's almost impossible to believe that everything will go well however most of the time everything does go very well but we are prepared mentally for things not going the way they're intended in this sort of event when there's no normally during the launch the crew reactors they would in a simulator they practice their reactions multiple times in the simulator so they don't ask what's happening what do we do you
