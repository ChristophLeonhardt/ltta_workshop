SPANISH LANGUAGE INTERPRETER IS 
IN THE COURTROOM. 
IN ADDITION AT THE DEFENSE 
TABLE IS A PRIVATELY RETAINED 
INTERPRETER TO BE USED FOR 
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND HIS 
CLIENT. 
MR.RIVERA, ARE YOU ABLE TO 
UNDERSTAND TODAY'S 
UNDERSTANDINGS THROUGH THE 
INTERPRETER?       
>> YES.        
>> THE DEFENSE HAS FILED A 
MOTION FOR A PRIVATE HEARING. 
THE DEFENSE HAS ALSO FILED A 
RESISTANCE TO THE USE OF THE 
EXPANDED MEDIA. 
WE'LL HEAR ARGUMENTS ON THAT 
MOTION FIRST. 
MR.RICHARDS--   
>> IF IT MAY PLEASE THE COURT, 
MR. PROSECUTOR, I PULLED A CASE 
LAW THIS MORNING FROM IOWA 
COURT OF APPEALS.       
AND IT'S STATE VERSUS JACK 
HAYES, OCTOBER 3, 2012. 
AND IT'S NUMBER 2-701-11-0669. 
AND THERE'S A PIECE IN THAT 
CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT EXPANDED 
MEDIA COVERAGE. 
AND THIS PARTICULAR COURT THERE 
GRANTED THE EXPANDED COVERAGE.  
>> BUT THE SUPREME COURT 
CONCLUDED IT'S WITHIN THE 
DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE TO 
EXCLUDE THE EXPANDED MEDIA 
COVERAGE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES 
OF THE PARTICULAR PROCEEDINGS. 
SUCH COVERAGE WOULD INTERFERE 
WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES 
FOR A FAIR TRIAL. 
AND IT'S BASED ON 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. 
ESSENTIALLY, THE PREJUDICE HERE 
IS THE DECISION BEFOREHAND TO 
LEAN IN FAVOR OF ONE SIDE OR 
THE OTHER WHICH PREVENTS 
JUSTICE. 
THE COVERAGE THAT'S OUT THERE 
IS LEANING ALL ONE WAY. 
IN FACT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
WEIGHED IN AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS OF A PREDISPOSITION THAT 
THIS YOUNG MAN IS GUILTY. 
BUT IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, 
HE'S ENTITLED TO THAT 
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE UNTIL 
SOME EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED. 
AT THIS TIME THERE'S BEEN NO 
EVIDENCE PRESENTS, YOUR HONOR. 
AND WE'RE URGING THE COURT TO 
PREVENT THE CAMERAS FROM COMING 
IN HERE WHICH COULD SHOW BIAS 
OR PREJUDICE AND GET IT INTO 
THIS POLITICAL CONTROVERSY OF 
PORTRAYING HIM AS SOMETHING 
THAT HE ISN'T. 
IN SOME WAYS I VIEW THIS AS A 
POLITICAL PAYBACK FOR WHAT'S 
SWIRLING AROUND IN TERMS OF THE 
MEDIA. 
AND THE MEDIA IS FEEDING INTO 
IT. 
THEY HAVE NOT MADE EFFORTS AS 
FAR AS I CAN SEE TO GIVE 
JUSTICE FOR ANY TYPE OF LEANING 
TOWARDS THIS PRESUMPTION OF 
INNOCENCE. 
AND THERE ARE WE'RE ASKING THIS 
COURT TO EXCLUDE THE MEDIA FROM 
THE PROCEEDINGS. 
IT COULD BE ONE NOD OF THE 
HEAD, ONE GLANCE, ONE SLIGHT OF 
HAND THAT WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF 
CONTEXT AND PRESENTED OVER AND 
OVER WHICH WOULD BE HYLE 
PREJUDICIAL TO THE DEFENDANT. 
I URGE THE COURT TO EXCLUDE THE 
COURT FROM THE PROCEEDINGS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MR.BROWN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
MAKE AN ARGUMENT? 
>> YES, JUDGE, THE STATE HAS NO 
OBJECTION TO THE EXPANDED MEDIA 
REQUEST. 
I THINK THEY FOLLOWED PROPER 
PROCEDURE. 
MR-- IS THE REGIONAL MEDIA 
COORDINATOR. 
IT'S VERY ROUTINE IN CASES THAT 
GARNER SOME SORT OF HIGH 
PROFILE THAT THE MEDIA HAS 
INTEREST. 
THE SUPREME COURT HAS PROVIDED 
RULE FOR THE COURT TO FOLLOW IN 
ALLOWING MEDIA COVERAGE OF 
CASES AND COURT PROCEEDINGS. 
WE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO 
THE EXPANDED MEDIA REQUEST. 
THERE'S BEEN A REQUEST FOR A 
VIDEO CAMERA AND A STILL CAMERA 
WHICH IS USUAL UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
SO WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE 
MEDIA -- EXPANDED MEDIA REQUEST 
IN THIS CASE. 
I WOULD ASSUME ONCE THE CASE -- 
WHOEVER THE DISTRICT COURT 
JUDGE IS THAT ASSIGNS THE CASE 
WILL PROBABLY READDRESS THAT 
ISSUE. 
SECONDLY, THERE'S BEEN A MOTION 
FILED. 
I JUST GOT THIS WHEN I WALKED 
IN THIS AFTERNOON. 
A MOTION FOR PRIVATE HEARING 
PRUDENT TO IOWA RULE OF 
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 2.24. 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT MR. 
RICHARDS HERE WAS REFERENCING  
WHEN HE WAS ARGUING THAT 
THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL 
PROBABILITY THAT THE 
DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO A FAIR 
TRIAL WILL BE PREJUDICED BY THE 
PUBLICITY AND THE CLOSURE OF 
THIS PROCEEDING WOULD PREVENT. 
HE HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ANYTHING 
THAT WOULD HAPPEN TODAY IN THIS 
PARTICULAR HEARING THAT WOULD 
CREATE ANY TYPE OF SUBSTANTIAL 
PROBABILITY THAT HIS FAIR TRIAL 
WOULD BE IMPACTED. 
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT  
WHATEVER THE POLITICAL 
DISCOURSE IS THAT'S BEEN 
SURROUNDING THE CHARGE OF THIS 
CASE. 
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT. 
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS AT THIS 
POINT. 
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION 
THAT IS OUT THERE ABOUT THE 
CASE AND THIS PARTICULAR 
CHARGE. 
I THINK ALL THE COURT IS GOING 
TO DO IS FOLLOW RULE 2.2 IN THE 
INITIAL APPEARANCE ADVISING HIM 
OF HIS RIGHTS, MAKING SURE HE'S 
GOT COUNSEL THAT HE'S EITHER 
RETAINED OR APPOINTED AND 
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF A 
PRELIMINARY HEARING AND WHETHER 
OR NOT HE DEMANDS THAT. 
I FAIL TO SEE HOW ANY 
SUBSTANTIAL PROBABILITY OF -- 
THE IMPACT ON THE DEFENDANTS 
FAIR TRIAL WOULD BE RAISED IN 
THIS PARTICULAR PROCEEDING. 
SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE MOTION 
FOR ARRIVE HEARING BE DENIED 
AND THE EXPANDED MEDIA REQUEST 
BE GRANTED. 
>> IF I MAY RESPOND, YOUR 
HONOR. 
>> BRIEFLY. 
>> PROCEDURES WEREN'T FOLLOWED. 
I ENTERED MY APPEARANCE THIS 
MORNING, ATTEMPTED TO SHORTLY 
AFTER 8 A.M. 
THE E-FILE SYSTEM WAS DOWN OR 
CRASHED. 
I DID NOT SEE THE MOTION FOR 
EXPANDED MEDIA COVERAGE UNTIL 
12:00 TODAY. 
AND IF THAT MOTION WAS FILED 
YESTERDAY, CHRISTIAN WAS STILL 
SELF-REPRESENTED. 
HE WAS NEVER SERVED A COPY OF 
THAT NOTICE, AND I NEVER 
RECEIVED A PHYSICAL COPY 
ALTHOUGH I DO ACKNOWLEDGE I SAW 
IT AT 12:00 TODAY. 
MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT THE E-
FILE SYSTEM WAS BACK UP. 
THE RULES HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLIED 
WITH. 
AND THE PROSECUTOR SAYS THE 
RULES WERE FOLLOWED. 
THEY WERE NOT FOLLOWED.     
>> MR. RICHARDS, I'M AWARE OF 
THE FACT THAT WE HAD TECHNICAL 
DIFFICULTIES WITH THE E-FILING 
SYSTEM THAT THE IOWA JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM USES. 
BECAUSE I WAS AWARE OF THAT I 
MADE CONTACT WITH BOTH YOU AND 
MR. BROWN, NOTIFIED EACH OF YOU 
OF THE EXPANDED MEDIA COVERAGE 
FIRST THING THIS MORNING, 
EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTIES WE 
WERE HAVING IN MAKING THE PAPER 
COPIES AVAILABLE TO YOU. 
AND SAID AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVED 
AT THE COURTHOUSE WE WOULD MAKE 
EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO YOU IF 
EDMS WAS NOT AVAILABLE. 
I BELIEVE WE'VE FOLLOWED THE 
PROCEDURES AVAILABLE TO US. 
AND WE HAVE GONE OUT OF OUR WAY 
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE WE WERE 
HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES 
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE WERE 
MAKING YOU AWARE OF THINGS 
BEING FILED. 
AND WE ALLOWED YOU TO FILE AN 
EARLY APPEARANCE BY FAX WHICH 
WOULD NOT BE A NORMAL 
PROCEDURE. 
SO YOU DID TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE FACT THAT THE COURT WAS 
WORKING WITH YOU AND TRYING TO 
ACCOMMODATE FOR THE TECHNICAL 
DIFFICULTIES WE'RE HAVING. 
AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO RULE 
ON THE MOTION FOR A PRIVATE 
HEARING AND ALSO THE REQUEST 
FOR EXPANDED MEDIA COVERAGE.    
WITH A REMINDER TO EVERYONE 
THAT THE DEFENDANT WILL NOT BE 
ASKED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS 
RELATED TO FACTS IN THIS CASE 
TODAY. 
I MAKE THE FOLLOWING FINDING. 
THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO A FAIR 
TRIAL IS NOT PREJUDICED BY THE 
PUBLICITY AS RELATED TO THE 
INITIAL APPEARANCE. 
REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES HAVE 
BEEN ESTABLISHED, INCLUDING 
LIMITING MEDIA COVERAGE TO ONE 
VIDEO CAMERA AND ONE STILL 
CAMERA. 
TODAY'S INITIAL APPEARANCE WILL 
BE HELD IN OPEN COURT AND THE 
MEDIA WILL BE ALLOWED TO STAY 
IN THE COURTROOM.    
MR. RICHARDS, YOU ALSO FILED A 
MOTION FOR A GAG ORDER AND IN 
DISCUSSIONS HELD OFF THE RECORD 
PRIOR TO TODAY'S HEARING YOU 
INDICATED THAT YOU INTENDED FOR 
THAT GAG ORDER TO BE HEARD BY A 
DISTRICT COURT JUDGE. 
IS THAT STILL YOUR INTENT? 
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S THE PROPER 
PROCEDURE YOUR HONOR. 
>> I WILL FILE A CALENDAR ENTRY 
ASKING THE DISTRICT COURT TO 
SET THAT FOR HEARING.       
WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO 
THE INITIAL APPEARANCE. 
MR.RIVERA, THIS IS YOUR INITIAL 
APPEARANCE ON THE CHARGE OF 
MURDER IN THE FIRST-DEGREE AND 
ON AN IMMIGRATION DETAINER 
NOTICE OF ACTION FILED BY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY. 
THE PURPOSE OF AN INITIAL 
APPEARANCE IS TO MAKE SURE YOU 
UNDERSTAND THE CHARGES AGAINST 
YOU, TO REVIEW ANY REQUESTS FOR 
AN APPOINTMENT OF AN ATTORNEY. 
AND TO SET FURTHER DATES IN 
THIS MATTER AND DISCUSS YOUR 
TERMS OF RELEASE FROM JAIL. 
MR.RIVERA, DO YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THINGS 
WE'LL BE COVERING TODAY? 
>> NO. 
>> MR. RIVERA YOU HAVE BEEN 
CHARGED WITH MURDER IN THE 
FIRST-DEGREE IN VIOLATION OF 
707.2 -- A CLASS A FELONY. 
HAVE YOU BEEN GIVEN A COPY OF 
THIS PAPERWORK?    
>> YES. 
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY HAS FILED AN 
IMMIGRATION DETAINER NOTICE OF 
ACTION FOR YOU. 
MR.RIVERA HAVE YOU RECEIVED A 
COPY OF THIS PAPERWORK?    
>> I BELIEVE SO. 
>> MR. RIVERA I'M NOW GOING TO 
REVIEW RIGHTS THAT EVERY 
DEFENDANT HAS IN A CRIMINAL 
ACTION. 
THESE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. 
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN 
ATTORNEY. 
EVERY DEFENDANT HAS THE RIGHT 
TO RETAIN LEGAL COUNSEL AND 
SHALL BE ALLOWED REASONABLE 
TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT 
AN ATTORNEY. 
IN THE EVENT YOU ARE INDIGENT 
AND DESIRE COUNSEL AND IF THE 
OFFENSE IS A SERIOUS 
MISDEMEANOR OR GREATER, AN 
ATTORNEY CAN BE APPOINTED TO 
REPRESENT YOU. 
MR.RIVERA, AT THIS TIME YOU ARE 
REPRESENTED BY A PRIVATELY 
RETAINED ATTORNEY, ALLEN 
RICHARDS, DO YOU WISH TO 
CONTINUE WITH THIS PRIVATE 
REPRESENTATION OR FILE FOR A 
COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY?      
>> NO, WITH RICHARD.     
>> MR. RIVERA IF AT ANY TIME 
TODAY DURING TODAY'S 
PROCEEDINGS YOU WISH TO TALK TO 
YOUR ATTORNEY, PLEASE LET ME 
KNOW AND I'LL STOP TODAY'S 
HEARING. 
>> OKAY. 
>> NEXT TOUGH RIGHT TO BE 
RELEASED FROM CUSTODY. 
EVERY DEFENDANT IN CUSTODY HAS 
THE RIGHT SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS 
TO BE RELEASED FROM CUSTODY 
PENDING JUDGMENT. 
A DEFENDANT MAY BE RELEASED 
FROM CUSTODY ON HIS OR HER OWN 
PERSONAL RECOGNIZANCE OR ON 
CONDITIONS AS THE COURT 
DETERMINES TO ENSURE THE 
DEFENDANT'S APPEARANCE AND 
REASONABLY ENSURE THE PUBLIC'S 
SAFETY. 
IF THE COURT IMPOSES CONDITIONS 
AND DEFENDANT IS UNABLE TO MEET 
THESE CONDITIONS, THE DEFENDANT 
HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST A BOND 
REVIEW HEARING. 
IF THE DEFENDANT IS INDIGENT 
AND UNABLE TO RETAIN LEGAL 
COUNSEL, THE COURT WILL APPOINT 
AN ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT YOU 
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE BOND 
REVIEW HEARING. 
NEXT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AGAINST 
SELF-INCRIMINATION. 
A DEFENDANT IS NOT REQUIRED TO 
MAKE ANY STATEMENT CONCERNING 
THE OFFENSE CHARGED TO THE 
COURT, TO ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICER OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON. 
BUT IF THE DEFENDANT MAKES ANY 
SUCH STATEMENTS, THOSE 
STATEMENTS CAN BE USED AGAINST 
THE DEFENDANT. 
AND FINALLY, DEFENDANTS HAVE A 
RIGHT TO TRIAL. 
EVERY DEFENDANT HAS THE RIGHT 
TO A TRIAL AND TO BE TRIED BY A 
JURY. 
>> THE JUDGE IN THE MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS CASE READING THE 
RIGHTS TO THE SUSPECTED 
GENTLEMAN YOU SEE THERE 
INVOLVED POTENTIALLY IN HER 
MURDER. 
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR THAT EVENT. 
AND WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING 
ROOM.
