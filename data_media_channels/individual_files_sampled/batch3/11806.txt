EU countries have now reached a much awaited compromise on tackling the migrant crisis under pressure from Italy and certain Central European countries Europe's powerhouses France and Germany have agreed to tougher regulations RT correspondent Paula salir breaks down the meetings outcomes well after a night of long and terse discussions European leaders reached a compromise agreement but the fact of the matter is that there are some major changes that are now going to be implemented these include amongst others their migrants can no longer choose in which country they will live they will also be migrant centers that will be established in non-european countries in this respect more support will be given to Mediterranean countries with that are also affected by the whole migrant crisis now the relocation of migrants across the European Union will be done on a voluntary basis and at the same time the Dublin agreement will be thoroughly reformed this is an agreement that places the responsibility on the country in which the migrants arrived in Europe it places the responsibility on that country and as I say this will be reformed so that what will happen is that you will have joined European forces rescues in the Mediterranean Sea for example and the responsibility of this will not fall as it has done in the past almost solely on the Italian forces now the European power houses particularly France and Germany are trying to present this as a victory for European Union the French president as well as the German Chancellor are pushing for this but what they fail to acknowledge is that they really have had to bow to pressure from Italy and other Central European countries you need to just look for example at the voluntary relocation of migrants it wasn't so long ago that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel presented an unyielding stance on this suggesting that those countries who refused to take in new migrants would not receive the same kind of funding as those who adhere to the quota system and it was just over a week ago that we heard the French president macron lashing out at Italy's new government for refusing to take in migrants from the aquarias vessel a realities that Europe is not going through a migrant crisis like it was in 2050 Dean this is not true those who say these are not telling the truth even the country like Italy doesn't have the same migrant pressure like it had last year for now it certainly seems as if Italy has one forcing other countries to take into consideration its gripes the Italian Prime Minister has held the outcome so I would say that overall we can be really satisfied it was a long negotiation the takeaway from today is no longer alone well on Thursday Italy effectively blocked a statement and issued an ultimatum to Brussels the situation was extremely tense with the European Council President Donald Tusk warning that there was further division in store for Europe what of course remains to be seen is how these new changes will be implemented on the ground and how in fact they ultimately will pan out let's go get some more details on this and bring in Italian journalist marchello for joining us here on the program today great to see you today what do you make of the EU summit outcome is it perhaps a victory for Italy which got other member states perhaps to take into consideration its concerns well I don't wouldn't say a victory for Italy but I would say that Italy now clearly shows that they wants to count in Europe they want that the Italian voice should be heard at any time and with the new respects that basically was missing in the last year's so for Italy Italy now is much stronger than two days ago but of the the matter of the agreement I would say it's too early to say that it's a victory because the impression we have is that the agreement does not really solve the problems but it takes time it's postponed the solution of the problems and the big question is will Europe really be able to solve a huge problem a usurer trauma which is the the migrant crisis that we know well it certainly has been dividing various European states for quite a few years now with some having an open door policy and other ones would prefer to have a closed door policy marchello among the measures the EU leaders have agreed upon is the creation of migrant centers outside of Europe how viable do you think it is I mean do you actually expect for example North African countries and states to host such facilities and if they did what could they ask for in return hey this is an excellent question I'm sorry I have no real and wiser answer to you for you and this is something that ideologically everybody says it's a good solution let's keep the migrants away and let's keep select between selecting them in Africa instead of a leader on top but then you have to reach agreement sir you have to face corruption which is very high in Africa and and it takes a lot of time so I guess that that is a long-term project that nobody knows when it will be implemented and if it will be really effective now this are this compromise agreement it does call for migrant relocation on a voluntary basis do you think that might work in reality I mean how likely is it for example marchello that countries that have said no to taking in any more migrants will suddenly change their minds and say oh ok then open the door I would say this will happen the problem is that everybody nobody really wants the migrants in this territory so and this is something that is not good news for Italy but this also gives the press the excuse let's say so to Italy to say ok we will not accept migrants anymore here because nobody helped us to relocate them and my impression is really that this is a very critical point and there is no share solution among European countries and this is one of the topic that we reface very rapidly in the future and will be a very important topic for the European elections next year in the case that the league here in Italy will gain a lot of votes if they keep a very severe position on this topic it's really hard now what chela we've spoken to various our international and political analysts who have said that ultimately certain Central European states and others manage to pressure France and Germany to really sit down nine hours of talks and deliberations Italy forcing some pressure Hungary Slovenia for example doesn't want any more doors open to migrants coming from North Africa my question to you marchello is after pressure has been put on France and after pressure has been put on Germany how true is it do you think that France and Germany are really listening to other members of the European neighbourhood or could it just be politicking yes it's political see Frau Merkel is really in deep political troubles we don't know whether she will become Chancellor in the next weeks and so she was obliged to reach and compromise but miss omicron is not consistent at all I mean he's keep saying that he wants a more solidary and human Europe but then he's the first who blocks migrants in on the border in Italy and he blocks the port without it does not accept NGO as vessels to arrive in the French port and this is something that really is shocking for the other countries because it how can France give lessons to us when they are not at all an example to follow and this I talk recei I would say from first person the McCrone has not been solved at this cinemates omit my impression is that there are two options the first option is we break everything and Europe is over the Schengen is over market is over all we try to fight to sign a compromise which does not solve the problem but gives us more time to see whether we can really find a solution on this topic and at the end of all the countries the visigoths countries Italy decided that at least Europe should have had a new chance to survive but I'm personally quite skeptical that with this attitude with the attitude of present macron if it's possible to find a compromise and a stable and solution Italian journalists marchello for very interesting comments indeed thank you for your time today thanks for joining us on our tea thank you happy you
