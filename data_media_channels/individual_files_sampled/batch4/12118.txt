I would say and I think anyone who's not a materialist would have to say that your mind is your soul you know there's one in the same so the point is even if a chemical imbalance Minh and it hasn't been but even if it were there would still be a question about whether that imbalance Minh is a reflection or a symptom of the spiritual problem problem problem rather than itself being the cause of the problem and even if you don't factor in the human soul I mean this is just that's just one of the issues here even if you don't factor that in and even if you did prove this imbalance materi still you wouldn't be able to prove that the imbalance Minh whatever disorder because you couldn't prove that the imbalance Minh isn't itself caused by say environmental factors or life experience or any number of other things so again there are these enormous leaps of logic that are being made when we talk about mental illnesses and we're just allowing the drug companies and doctors to make those leaps and we're not even questioning them but even if we were to put all this to the side even if you were to accept just for a moment that brain chemistry determines everything about a person um and even if we were to accept that there is this chemical imbalance and the chemical imbalance Minh itself does cause say ADHD or depression whatever that still wouldn't prove that a particular personality like the ADHD personality for instance is disordered it doesn't prove in other words that a person shouldn't be that way we've decided that kids aren't supposed to be that way we've decreed it from on high like gods and then we've set out to chemically eliminate every human disposition that we find inconvenient or difficult but that is subjective it's arbitrary it's not scientific and again we do the same thing with adults we do with all people we look at unfavorable characteristics emotions and personalities and we decide that because they are unfavorable they must therefore be medical think that's how medicine works so we may say for instance that somebody has an exotic disorder okay but who's to say that they shouldn't have anxiety the anxiety is disordered okay what do you mean what is the proper order for anxiety say it's a disorder of anxiety okay well what what how is anxiety supposed to work or are you saying that there shouldn't be any anxiety at all how do you determine that and who determined it and on what authority based on what science now I have a lot of anxiety I it's unpleasant I don't like it and no I don't think that a person should live consumed by anxiety but neither do I think that anxiety is necessarily a medical condition and I also think that it hasn't been proven to be a medical condition it has rather been decided philosophically that it must be a medical condition and that's a problem you know I think it's it's possible just possible but I think there are you know there are many problems that a person can have serious problems um difficult painful problems that doesn't mean that the problems are medical it doesn't mean that they're physical at all there could be other things going wrong things in your life things in your souls that you know you just you if there's any number of other things that could be happening to cause problems for a person what we've done is we have eliminated all of those possibilities and now everything has to just be medical and physical I'm not saying that mental illnesses don't exist I'm saying that there are many questions we aren't asking and we should be um I'm also saying that when analyzing a person's emotional and mental issues we can't completely disregard things like free will choice environment experience and the soul yet that is exactly what we've done with mental illness and we've done so on the word of drug companies and psychiatrists who themselves are still pushing debunked theories to explain the problems that they're supposed to be treating that's what I'm saying and that's all I'm saying and maybe these are questions we should think about and try to answer before we continue along this path of turning everything and everyone into a mental disorder just a thought
