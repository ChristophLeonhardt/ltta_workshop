according to the latest reports from The Associated Press Ivanka Trump is currently still having some of her brand name clothing and apparel and shoes produced at a Chinese factory whose conditions are basically those of a sweatshop now according to this newest report The Associated Press spoke with one current and two former employees at this factory where they make at rivana Trump's brand of shoes along with a lot of other different brands who have shoes made in this factory as well all three of the workers that they spoke to discussed an incident that took place last year where one worker was smashed over the head with the sharp end of a high-heeled shoe and was profusely bleeding from his head now that is just one of the many human rights abuses that have taken place at this factory that Ivanka Trump at least as of May of this year was still using as her main supplier for her Footwear other abuse is reported by these people and reported by China labor watch include employees being forced to sign false pay stubs showing that they were being paid more than they actually were according to reports workers in this factory are paid about eighty to ninety percent less than the liveable federal mandated wages that the Chinese government has imposed for this particular reason they're also forced to work sometimes well past midnight after beginning their day at 7:10 a.m. so workers are putting them you know a good 17 hours a day forced to meet quotas of about 30,000 shoes per production line and this is what Ivanka Trump and many other retailers and tailor Jessica Simpson BCBG lots of other different places get their shoes from this one particular factory but this is what they see is okay this is what we as American consumers turn a blind eye to when we go shopping for the most part I know a lot of people try to be conscious about what they purchase and where it comes from but at the end of the day we don't know the full extent of what we're doing but here's the thing this factory where Ivanka Trump gets her shoes produced that has been under investigation for well over a year in fact last month three people who were investigating it were actually arrested and detained for 30 days according to the Chinese government they were accused of using illegal recording devices to steal trade secrets when in actuality they were trying to determine what kind of sweatshop light conditions these workers were being forced to work under advantage Trump as the daughter of the sitting president of the United States should be held to higher standards after all her father is the one who says that he wants to bring American manufacturing back to the United States well that's fantastic how about you start with your own companies how about Ivanka gets out there and starts with her own companies could that raise production costs yes is it worth it to not have people living in these kind of conditions where you pay them $1 when they're supposed to be making $5 an hour yeah it is and we as consumers also have to accept that sometimes in order to save people's lives and get them out of these hellish conditions we have to be able to say no so this story actually goes a little bit far beyond Ivanka Trump and it stretches really to all of us but at the end of the day the ultimate responsibility really does fall on those people who are using sweatshop labor like this people like Ivanka Trump they have to be held accountable she may not be over there committing these abuses but I refuse to believe that these people don't at least have some kind of inkling as to what's happening at the factory where their goods are produced and if they don't know about these then I would think as a shareholder I would be more concerned about the fact that the CEO doesn't understand what's happening at these factories factories that are producing goods that have this person named Ivanka Trump stamped onto every product that shows gross negligence if you ask me in a vodka Trump somehow someway needs to be held accountable as well as all of these other companies who are using sweatshop labor to produce goods to be sold in the United States
