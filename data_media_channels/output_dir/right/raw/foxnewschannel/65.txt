1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:02,726
YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

2
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:04,394
15 DAYS FROM ELECTION DAY.

3
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:08,465
JOINING US NOW AUTHOR OF A NEW

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,266
BOOK.

5
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:15,138
TRUMP THE BLUE COLLAR PRESIDENT.

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,774
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI.

7
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:22,145
I LOOK THE PARTY OF NO

8
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:24,181
CONSTITUTION ORDER IN THE

9
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:26,183
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS.

10
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,453
NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

11
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:33,724
SANCTUARY CITY AND ELIMINATING

12
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:33,991
ICE.

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,926
A PARTY THAT WON'T CONDEMN THE

14
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:45,669
MOB THAT SAYS THE LEADERS SAYING

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,236
CONFRONT THEM.

16
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:48,238
WHY DO THEY EVEN HAVE A SHOT IN

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,073
15 DAYS IS THE REAL QUESTION?

18
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:54,044
>> IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MEDIA

19
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:54,478
PROBABLY.

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,612
THAT COULD BE ONE.

21
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:57,314
MANY REASONS.

22
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:01,151
THE PRESIDENT ON A NIGHT LIKE

23
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:01,485
TONIGHT.

24
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:03,020
A RESOUNDING RALLY.

25
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,788
EVERY NIGHT WHEN THE PRESIDENT

26
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:09,960
IS OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN, HE IS

27
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:13,830
PUTTING THEM DEEP IN THEIR OWN

28
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,131
ZONE.

29
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:15,265
THE DEMOCRATS ARE BACKED UP TO

30
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:15,933
THEIR GOAL LINE.

31
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:18,969
HE IS TERRIFIC AT THAT.

32
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,104
IT'S WAY TIGHTER.

33
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:27,911
THE BEST CLIP YOU SHOWED WAS THE

34
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:29,346
BERNIE SANDERS CLIP SAYING THIS

35
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:31,715
IS TIGHTER THAN EVER BEFORE.

36
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,283
THE MOST UNUSUAL PRESIDENCY

37
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:33,584
EVER.

38
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:34,952
MOST PEOPLE PREDICT THAT THE

39
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:36,587
HOUSE AND SO FAR GOES TO THE

40
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:37,421
OTHER SIDE.

41
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:39,122
THE PRESIDENT IS DEMONSTRATING

42
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:42,125
HE CAN GET THE VOTER TURNOUT

43
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:43,260
EVEN IN A MID-TERM ELECTION.

44
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:45,128
I THINK IT WILL BE CLOSE.

45
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:47,097
YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED.

46
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:51,401
OUR FRIENDS WON'T BE SURPRISED.

47
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,503
RUSH LIMBAUGH WON'T BE SURPRISED

48
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,772
IF THE DEMOCRATS DON'T GET THE

49
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:56,340
BLUE WAVE.

50
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,241
>> Sean: I AM LESS WORRIED ABOUT

51
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,576
THE SENATE.

52
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,745
IF RICK SCOTT CAN WIN AS A

53
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:11,788
SENATE CANDIDATE IN FLORIDA AND

54
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:12,990
RON DESANTIS IS GOVERNOR AND

55
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,992
HEIDI HEITKAMP IS TOAST IN NORTH

56
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:15,359
CAROLINA.

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,927
THEN YOU HAVE JOHN TESTER IN THE

58
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,662
FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.

59
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:23,800
HE COULD LOSE IN MONTANA.

60
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:28,238
I HOPE THE PEOPLE IN INDIANA

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,340
REJECT THE LIBERTARIAN SO THEN

62
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:31,141
JOE IS TOAST.

63
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:34,611
IT'S THE HOUSE I AM WORRIED

64
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:34,911
ABOUT.

65
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:38,015
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH 15 DAYS.

66
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,250
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME ON THE

67
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,586
CLOCK TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT.

68
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:43,987
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO US DURING

69
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,856
THE CAMPAIGN.

70
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:48,125
EVERYBODY COUNTED US OUT AFTER

71
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,394
THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPE AND

72
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:53,830
WHAM HE IS THE 45th PRESIDENT OF

73
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:54,364
THE UNITED STATES.

74
00:02:54,365 --> 00:02:57,801
THAT WAS ONLY 30 DAYS.

75
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,905
15 DAYS, THAT'S A MOOCH AND A

76
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:02,205
HALF.

77
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,073
>> Sean: [LAUGHING].

78
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:04,241
I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU.

79
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:07,778
YOU CAPTURED SOMETHING IN YOUR

80
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:08,078
BOOK.

81
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,280
IT'S ON AMAZON.COM.

82
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:12,849
TRUMP THE BLUE COLLAR PRESIDENT.

83
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,719
THE PEOPLE HE IS HELPING ARE THE

84
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,755
FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN.

85
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:26,630
THAT'S SCARAMUCCI AND "HANNITY."

86
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:27,030
ABSOLUTELY.

87
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:29,199
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,499
GUY.

89
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,734
THEY ARE POSITIVE.

90
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,736
THE MEDIA CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY

91
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:33,103
WANT.

92
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:35,739
THE MORE MEDIA NONSENSE THROWN

93
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,442
AT THE PRESIDENT, THE MORE

94
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:40,777
PEOPLE ARE LIKE THE SCARAMUCCIs.

95
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,612
LIBERALS DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT

96
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:42,946
MESSAGE.

97
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:44,548
THEY TALK OVER YOU.

98
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,282
THAT'S FINE.

99
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:47,384
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF WRITING A

100
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,720
BOOK LIKE THIS, IF THE LIBERALS

101
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,556
READ IT THEY WILL SEE THE

102
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:53,390
PRESIDENT'S PLAYBOOK.

103
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,358
I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER.

104
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,927
I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE

105
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:00,630
WHY HE WON FROM MY VANTAGE

106
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:00,931
POINT.

107
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:02,199
>> Sean: I HAVE TO RUN.

108
00:04:02,200 --> 00:00:00,000
CONGRATS.
