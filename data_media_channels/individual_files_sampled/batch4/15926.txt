it looks like the Labour Party is disintegrating over the brexit vote with six front benches resigning and 90 MPs rebelling following the mammoth voting session on June 12th it looks like the Labour Party could be disintegrating over disagreements over Bragg's it's six front bench and peas have resigned Corbin needs a new cabinet and a total of 90 MPs of rebelled over a brexit vote Skye reports Jeremy Corbyn has suffered a 90 strong rebellion over a brexit vote on remaining in the European Economic Area with six of his MPs resigning from their front bench rolls junior labour front benchers Laura Smith Jacqueline Ellie Reeves Tania Antonia Zi and Anna McMurran were the first to step down from their roles on Wednesday night the resignations were revealed moments before the result of a vote on the Lord brazier amendment which called for the government to make remaining in the EEA and negotiating objective the government said before the vote had disagreed with the amendment and the labor front bench have been ordered to abstain the House of Commons voted three to seven to one to six to reject the proposed amendment was 74 Labour MPs rebelling against their party's whip to vote in favor of EEA membership a further 15 Labour MPs rebelled in breach of the abstain order to vote against EEA membership while one Labour MP Susan Ellen Jones also defied the party's official position to act as a teller for the vote rosy Duffield then became the sixth Labour MP to quit her front bench role so Labour MPs are defying Corbin who said they should abstain from this vote now why would Corbin want his MPs to abstain on the brexit vote it seems fairly obvious to me that Corbin's just trying to maintain his ambiguous stance on brexit the Labour Party is I mean look at the lewisham East violation for instance I keep talking about this because it's an important sort of it shows what people are feeling about labour right now and it looks like there's going to be a big swing to the Liberal Democrats and I think it's over this ambiguity remainders want the Labour Party to be committed to either remain or staying in the single market whereas brexit ears are saying well labor needs to be clearer about what they actually stand for you know obviously Corbin's thinking at this point well if we don't vote then neither side can cause traitors that's what he's trying to do now how can anybody trust the Labour Party and Corbin over this politicians aren't there to trick the people politicians are there to represent the people and when such a decisive vote is made by the people it's down to the politicians to uphold that vote and do everything they can in Parliament to make sure that the will of the people is enacted that's what it said in the literature that was delivered to every single household in this country it told us that the the decision we may make during the brexit referendum will be enacted by the government they will make the decision happen that's what they told us and I hope the voters in Lewisham East are seeing this right now they're out in going to the polls right now as I record this now regarding the EEA Corbin's told the press recently the Labour Party respects the outcome of the EU referendum and does not support the EEA or Norway model as it's not the right option for Britain it would leave us with next to no say over rules we have to follow it does not allow us to negotiate a new comprehensive UK EU customs union and it fails to resolve the Irish border issue so Corbin wants to maintain some kind of customs union I don't think he wants to stay in the customs union but he wants some new customs agreement it's all very confusing but you know if this is such a bad idea if staying in the EEA is such a bad idea then why didn't Corbin tell his party to vote against it surely that's the logical solution here is it because maybe maybe Corbin knows that his party's packed full of traitors and ideologues who would rather overturn the Democratic decision made by the public I think we know the answer to that one amazingly though there's some people in the labour party some Labour MPs who actually respect the decision made by the people Laura Smith being one of them as she resigned from the junior Shadow Cabinet and she told us remaining in the EEA is not the right way forward for our country taking rules from Brussels by having no role in making them is simply not good enough for Britain remaining in the EEA represent a failure to address the concerns of those who voted leave and heal the divisions in our society I promise Crewe and Nantwich that I would respect the referendum result remaining in the EEA is not compatible with that I will not vote for any amendment to breaks it legislation that does not deliver the exit from the European Union that my constituents voted for so amazingly there are still people in the labour party that respect democracy sawed off to an extent I mean she has resigned over it but these divisions in the labour party are quite severe and I'm not sure how Corbett can heal that it's next stop IKEA for Jeremy Corbyn who desperately needs a brand new cabinet sorry bad joke but with six MPs leaving his front bench and around 90 MPs defying the whip and not abstaining from the brexit vote it's clear that Corbin has no control over the Labour Party when a leader is unable to control his party like this and when he actively tells his members of parliament to abstain from a vote that could it could affect the whole future of this country it affects the outcome of these breads it votes in Parliament we know that he doesn't care about the world of the people and it shows that he's willing to go back on his own principles as well because we know that Corbin is not a remainer Corbin's always been a brexit ear but he's turning his back on that because he knows his own party is against him just as I said Theresa May should do Corbin and the Labour leadership should now be looking to replace candidates for the next general election with people like Laura Smith you actually respect the decision made by the voters Corbin it's time to take control of your party be true to your inner briggsie tear replace the people in your party with people who actually respect the voters and replace the people in your shadow cabinet with brags or tears then and only then maybe the voters will respect you and maybe the voters might trust you a little bit more if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and
