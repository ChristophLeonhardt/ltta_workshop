00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,800
Today,

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,180
bright yellow commuter bicycles
appeared on the streets of Seattle,

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,460
rentable for just $1 an hour.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,260
They come from a $2 billion Chinese startup called Ofo,

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,080
which is hoping the rollout
will give them an American toehold

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,410
in the global bike-sharing market.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,880
Dexter Thomas reports from
the company’s home base in Beijing,

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,000
where low-cost bike-sharing
is ubiquitous and big business.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,060
— Zhang Jincheng is a maintenance worker.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,160
He works for Ofo,

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,220
the biggest company in
a new wave of bikeshare services.

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,800
Most bikeshare programs around the world
use docks to collect and dispense bikes.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,620
But with Ofo,

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,760
you can leave your bike anywhere you want.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,789
And if you see an Ofo bike you wanna use,

16
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,519
you just scan a code with your phone,
unlock it, and take off—

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,740
for about 15 cents an hour.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,860
This kind of bike-sharing is new in China,

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,900
but it’s already becoming indispensable.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,700
— Ofo was created in 2014 by college students
at Peking University.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,500
It didn’t expand off-campus until last November,

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,940
and just eight months later,

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,280
Ofo was the biggest bikeshare company in the world.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,940
Ofo now operates in 150 cities,
including a few outside of China,

25
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,460
and it claims to have more than 100 million users

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,520
who make 20 million bike trips per day.

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,240
Thousands of new yellow bikes roll off the line every day,

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,980
just to meet demand from Ofo.

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,460
— The original way of using bike is not that convenient.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,260
If there is a bike that people can access
anywhere in the city at a very low cost

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,700
and can return with a very good convenience,

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,240
then people must love it.

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,100
— Zhang Yanqi is a COO of Ofo.

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,280
He used to work for Uber,

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,020
and joined the company last November
when they expanded off the college campuses.

36
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,180
Chinese tech giant Ali Baba
has poured millions into the company,

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,180
and Apple CEO Tim Cook visited
the company’s headquarters earlier this year.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,340
— How many people do you have
actually registered on the platform?

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,840
— It’s over 100 million users.

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,890
It’s a big number.

41
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,920
But in China, we have 1.3 billion,
so we still have some way to go, but…

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,600
— Okay, that’s one way of looking at it, alright.

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,480
— In a way,

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,420
this is a return to the culture that
made China the so-called bicycle kingdom.

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,480
In the bike’s heyday,

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,180
there were more than 500 million bikes in the country,

47
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,600
compared to roughly $370 million today.

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,000
— Dr. Rong Jian is the Director of
the Beijing Traffic Engineering Association:

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,260
— But Rong admits there have been
a few issues with the bike boom:

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,880
When you can leave a bike anywhere,

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,020
people tend to leave them everywhere.

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,040
Sidewalks and public walkways in popular areas
often get completely blocked off by bikes.

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,140
And in some areas,

54
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,920
there have even been reports of hundreds
of bikes being thrown into massive piles.

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,680
In fact,

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,060
Ofo had a trial run at the
University of California San Diego,

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
but the university kicked them out

58
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,100
partially because people were parking
the bikes all over campus.

59
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,540
But they still have high hopes for Seattle.

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,160
— The goal here is that we’re gonna go to
over 20 countries by the end of this year.

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,480
We wanna unlock every corner of the world,

62
00:03:56,480 --> 00:00:00,000
and we wanna provide a bike
for people to use anytime, anywhere.
