I am for me okay and you're in the stream today thousands of US prisoners are starting a nationwide strike for better conditions I'm Malika Villar we'll examine what's compelled inmates to protest and what they can achieve join the conversation through YouTube and Twitter over the next 20 days inmates in prisons jails and immigration detention centers will hold peaceful sit-ins hunger strikes and labor stoppages to push for reform of a system that they say abuses and exploits them that's right this is the second national prisoner strike in two years organizers hope to encourage even more inmates than than the 24,000 who took part in that record-breaking protests this year's demonstrations are led by jailhouse lawyers speak an incarcerated group of reform advocates they're supported by several other groups seeking changes to the prison system the strike was called in response to the death of seven inmates in a riot at a South Carolina State Prison in April it was the worst disturbance in a US prison in 25 years organizers are the strikes have several d months take a look at this clip featuring a former prisoner and organizer caught cold Dorsey he outlines some of the most pressing issues for inmates prisoners have called for immediate provement to the prisons and prison conditions having access to vote having access to the law library and law resources rehabilitation access and services Pell grants should be reinstated or there's been less and less services whether they be college degrees and particularly rehab services for more on the strike we are joined from Columbia South Carolina by crystal Roundtree she is a representative and organizer for jailhouse lawyers speak which is leading the protest we're also joined by Chandra Bose Elko she's a formerly incarcerated writer whose prison Diaries was honored with several awards she joins us from orange Connecticut Marilyn Ralston is a member of the California Coalition for women prisoners she's also a Grahame coordinator for project rebound at California State University as well as a just leadership USA alum she joins us from Fullerton California hello everybody malika wish me start on my computer hello on my computer with a member of our community who explains why we're here today and why this strike got started Kimberly here says what led to the strike today were the horrible conditions that prisoners were forced to live in these are condition or conditions that mirror the conditions that enslaved people were forced to live in and I think anyone being oppressed would fight back she goes on to say it was this incident at Lee Correctional Institution that we mentioned at the top of the show in South Carolina and the horrible deaths of seven inmates and injuring of others that really galvanized the situation and sparked these men and women into action crystal pick that apart for our international audience explained to us what happened that led to why we're here today thank you for having me once again you know prison conditions you know this the strike is essentially a demand for the recognization of the human rights of prisoners and the state of the prisons in this country currently there was a riot that took place you know which you alluded to a bit earlier here at Lee Correctional Institution in April of this year in South Carolina where seven inmates were in fact killed and 17 others were injured in very preventable under preventable circumstances certainly as a result of that prisoners across the nation essentially want to bring worldwide mass attention and awareness again to the conditions that they are being subjected to to the dangerous and violent and non-productive conditions of the prison system right now prisoners are essentially being warehoused without any sort of incentive no rehabilitation no treatment programs and so we we have the situation here that I describe as a crisis situation right now the prison system the prisoners are they have a host of demands that they are requesting as a result of this you know as a part of their demands for this national prison strike some of those things definitely include an immediate improvement to the conditions that they are subjected to on a daily basis and immediate in to prison slavery which is legitimately happening and going on right here today in America's prison system Kristen as you're thinking Chris was just speaking I hate my mouthing going uh-huh uh-huh it's resonating because you have been on the other side you have been inside remodeling can you what point would you have been surprised that okay there's a nationwide strike Oh is there no surprise whatsoever the prisoners some prisoners are saying we're not working I'm not to place at all you know what happened at Lee Correctional Facility was a tipping point and so across prisons in California you know we're overcrowded there's a lack of programming conditions of bad there needs to be policy improvements and so when you're warehousing folks in these deplorable conditions something that happens even in another state can give you the courage and the energy to step up and represent what you feel is is human dignity for you within California prisons we have almost 160,000 folks in cages we lead the national rate in suicide in deplorable conditions we've been warehousing folks through prison expansion since the 80s so it's really time for Governor Brown who is the governor here in California and governors across this nation to start treating incarcerated people with dignity and respect 95% of all incarcerated folks return to their communities that return should be a return where there's jobs where there's access to resources where there's higher education and it can start inside the prisons and is shame because I have batteries Sean joke ahead and I can I jump in here please to vacation there are two two separate issues though involved in this strike one the top demand is changing prison conditions which I wholeheartedly agree with the second one is about wages and abolishing prison labor I have written extensively um my experience with prison labor was actually positive I know that's not a typical situation but there are people who undergo significant emotional and rehabilitative changes through their prison jobs and I know when I was in if someone told me we're striking and then as of tomorrow we might not have jobs I don't know if I would have survived do you want to explain what that job was and how it helps you get through your time in prison Shanda it was a kitchen job so it was manual labor setting up the food serving it to the other women in the facility it actually taught me a significant number of leadership skills and as I've explained to a lot of other people it got me out of a five by ten cell that's not a natural state for a human being that's maybe sitting in a box or a cage maybe for a zoo animal or a new litter of kittens it's acceptable but not for human beings so even though I was being brought into a kitchen where I had to work very hard for 75 cents a day I was still in an open area where I could move around like a human being I was also doing things like cooking a soup or serving a soup that somewhere in the world someone else was doing the same thing whereas sitting in my cell that's just rotting and festering that's not human activity and that's I think some of I think that's one of the reasons why it's been hard to get some of these reforms and policies changed because the labor there folks do inside they are grateful for some of those skills do translate to jobs on the outside however you know those jobs inside can be a whole lot better wages can be improved the conditions in which people work definitely can be improved and it's that kind of attitude of gratitude that many of us have going into the prison system because we're ashamed and we're embarrassed of the things that we've done to get there that kind of leads us to this really grateful attitude around getting out of the cell and having these kind of dining room jobs and digging ditches for eight cents an hour or 17 cents an hour but I think the bigger picture here is that it doesn't allow us to save it doesn't it doesn't allow us to support our families on the outside prison wages don't allow you to be productive members of your family when you're incarcerated and that income is removed from your family when you're locked up right mermail and I think that's why there are several people online who are likening it to slavery this is August 21 jb ware who says the US prison labor system is based upon the 13th amendment which justifies slavery as punishment for a crime the system claims a lot of labor is voluntary but if prisoners refuse to work they are inherently punished by being trapped in the confines of their cells or solitary now and on that note we also got a video comment from someone who's working directly on this issue this is a Zadeh she's a legal and advocacy director for a project south which is focused on this issue and this is what she told the stream immigrants and the facility are basically call urge to participate in this work program by using threats of placing them in solitary confinement if they don't participate actually placing them in solitary or depriving them of life necessities so one of our plaintiffs one of our named plaintiffs tribe Ahmed he actually has since been deported to Bangladesh but he was detained at the Stewart Detention Center and he said that because he hadn't received his payment which I just mentioned reading meager wages between one to four dollars a day he hadn't received his payment and so he said no work tomorrow and so forth that was placed in solitary for several days and he continues to suffer from the impact of that so Romero and I could see you nodding your head there I want to know for an international audience as odd and that video comment is talking about immigration detention center but it shows really how broad this issue is because it's across jails prisons immigration detention centers and other places so that idea of this being modern-day slavery is that something that you can understand why people are saying oh it is because failure to program results in you lose in time it may result in you losing privileges it will result in you not earning any day for day milestone credits so working in the prison is is a voluntary thing but then it's not voluntary because you're punished if you don't work but again you don't receive the sufficient amount of pay for that work the labor that you put in is nowhere near equal and just because there's a loophole in the United States Constitution doesn't mean that people should be treated inhumanely without dignity and respect and and that's what the Thirteenth Amendment does christo I can see you let me just say the 13th amendment abolished slavery except if you are in prison so slavery still exists in the United States if you're prisoner Christel yes absolutely slavery still is very much alive and well and it's in this country to this day legitimized by the Thirteenth Amendment as several people have touched on already but I just want to back up for a moment and and and and note that in some states such as South Carolina majority of the people incarcerated there are literally being warehouse and I mean they're not working so they there there are other ways that people have decided to engage in the strike such as sit-ins boycotts not spending any money during for the next 20 days all of this is designed to send a message to the system and so in fact yes there are many prisoners in this country who are working under slave-like conditions and and we know this clearly as a slavery but I do just want to mention for the record there there are a number of people in this country prisoners who are incarcerated in detention centers immigration detention centers and and other locations that actually do not have a job they are literally being warehouse but they will be participating in the strike as well sure I have to play this for our audience this comes from the incarcerated workers organizing committee this is Darryl Aitken's he sums up what it is like to work as a prisoner and the wages you get have a listen to Darryl I started out as a lying server serving foods but breakfast and dinner then I became a dishwasher and just all the maintenance of the kitchen and then pay much to pay dirt you know basically I want to make twenty dollars a month and they took fifty five percent of that out for restitution so joining us on the line from Staten prison in Alabama we have swift justice he is a co-founder of unheard voices that's a nonprofit advocating prison reform he's a key organizer of this strike talking to us from inside on his phone swift justice how's the strike going so far well hopefully it's gone pretty good now where I'm at we don't require these guys to actually do any work stops or anything like that but what we're focusing on is in the major institutions such as Holmen and West Jefferson and st. Claire and even saltwater is where we're hoping that everything's going as far as being able to reach out to the guys over there has been really silent today or we're assuming that they have them on lockdown at the camp so what actually happens when prisoners go on strike well basically what we're doing is we are doing peaceful protests and all we require is that these are comrades not to report to their jobs with their institutional jobs such as the Brotherhood on the recordings talking about it in the kitchens any HDI or what we call industrial jobs that Alabama uses and we sit down and we have requests requested maps who is also to boycott these stores and the canteens as well as any packages from different companies such as Union supply and so on we are asking also that that we bought that image boycott any spending of any visitation food that is served on the visitation yards it also goes back to the state of Alabama you know if justice for our audience that isn't aware I want to share this tweet we got from someone August 21 who says remember when you talked about the prison strike talk about what prisoners are striking for and they included a list of demands among them at the very top of the list is improving conditions of prisons and the second isn't immediate into prison slavery the list goes on there's about nine ten things on that list what is number one for you why are you striking well the number one thing for me and I think it's very important that every comrade that is boycotting or striking always remember our main goal is always to abolish the 13th eliminate a Federal Constitution and our state constitution as well here in Alabama that would be a section 1 article 32 of the Alabama 1901 Constitution that gives a loophole for the 13th amendment to give the state an leeway to own slaves and every other every other thing that we are demanding in our demand such as in Alabama one for instance saw changes dealing with the life-without-parole all criteria and other issues such as bringing in instead of good time for inmates to actually have control of their own fate and change and their release date um and the parole guidelines such as the paroles new guidelines as far as when an elevated eligible in Alabama to return back to society or parole a lot of our demands they as far as what's broke down pretty much mirror each other I know in South Carolina the brothers over there are asking for voting rights which is something that we here in Alabama have somewhat our one foot in the door and doing so it at this time Alabama inmates to have non moral turpitude crimes are allowed to vote inside the institutions are inside the jails and once they return inside society without receiving a pardon from the state but I think it important that we remember that our main focus and goal is to ask the 13th minute so thank you Swift for for mentioning prison abolition because that should be our primary goal is to abolish prisons and as you said to that list there's so many demands all ten of them are very important for me I would definitely want to to say that number one just improving the conditions but we need to abolish prisons and since we still have prisons that exist in our society today we need to have those prisons with conditions that support the the health wholeness and wellness of people and that's access to programming good mental health good medical care dental care and access to higher education but another really important point on their list of demands is around sentencing reforms in the state of California there's over a hundred and twenty sentence of reforms on the books that oftentimes lead people to getting these really high sentences of sixty eighty a hundred years to life and that's death by incarceration and thank you again for mentioning the life without the possibility of parole the California Coalition for women prisoners held a drop LWOP rally at the steps of the Capitol in Sacramento California asking Governor Brown to commute all 5000 sentences to life with the possibility they've been very good here in California with commuting sentences but they could do better but then I just want to bring women into the conversation because incarcerated women are different than incarcerated men and if folks are going to to exist in these cages we need to start thinking about ways that gender play a part in that and for trans and non gender conforming people there needs just be more access to services and programs that specifically speak to individuals identity so ro Maryland I spoke to a couple of Correctional departments or I teamed it because we wanted to have their voice in this conversation I didn't turn up in the conversation but they did send a statement South Carolina Department of Correction this is what they told us when we told them that we were doing this show they said that the agency is aware of a nationwide prison strike starting on August 21st 2018 we are currently monitoring this situation for any activity within the prison's the agency will take the necessary actions to ensure the prisons are safe Milica that said we always get comments like this Chandra and we got this live on YouTube so I want to share it with you Britta Armstrong says no one cares when you break the laws in America you forfeit freedom what do you say to people like Brenda I would say several things first I would say you don't necessarily have to forfeit freedom if you have transgressed or broken the law but there's a larger issue and I'm glad that this person who tweeted said the arts commented on YouTube said that is that we have a entirely too punitive society we have made it if you look at what's happening in the recent immigration situation where children are being separated from parents in the United States the attitude is that if you have broken a law if you have sinned if you have transgressed then anything goes so remember when we're talking about just losing freedom I think this person might be envisioning short sentences or things like that what I believe the other guy and I are talking about is a loss of life romero Ellen mentioned people who are sentenced to death by incarceration also the risks in prison labor of dying are actually kind of high there's no OSHA protection there's no workplace safety precautions that are implemented for inmates because we are cannot considered under the law employees which is another aspect of this that's totally dehumanizing and D values everything that we've done let me give you know I think it's very funny because I I've actually heard that many times people are talking about that at one point that I would love went outside because that is an issue that I really have a problem there so grant or whoever was it said that I would like to address that by saying this there's no law whatsoever that all refrains me or keeps me from moving that door you so it is very much in your interest to worry about what goes on in these places such as these prisons in the state of or in the United States of America because when I get out Who I am that day will reflect whatever you put in as a taxpaying citizen and the agencies that you pay your taxes to so every single day that's a really interesting point Rome alley and I want you to do a humble brag of all of the studies and the qualifications you've got while you were incarcerated well I was able to get some firefighter training and that included first first responder certification I earned several degrees inside the prison 72 minutes you mentioned how many degrees you are how many - a degrees a bachelor's degree of masters and that's not enough to have a conversation with university counseling all right so this this thing this is what we're seeing right in front of us this is real rehabilitation this conversation is not over yet if you're watching on TV we would like you to go to YouTube where we will continue the conversation on YouTube if you don't whether address is go-to at age a stream on Twitter we will tweet you the address for YouTube so that you can pick up the conversation we have cristal we have Chandra who has been incarcerated we have ro Marilyn who has been incarcerated we have swift justice who is currently in prison right now Mallika we will pick up on YouTube with this comment this is Brian on Twitter who says I defer to strikers to define success but I think they've already had lots of it with generating awareness around conditions we'll talk about what success means to be continued we will see you online on YouTube thanks for watching take care welcome back YouTube viewers we're gonna carry on just a little longer on the u.s. national prison strike keep your comments coming through the YouTube chat and I'll do my best to bring in as many as I can I want to start here with this tweet actually from Brian who talks about what it will look like to define success for this current prison strike he says I think they've already had lots of it with generating awareness around conditions and seizing the narrative on prisoner protests demands are absolutely achievable there are pretty basic things you'd expect in a more fair and humane system and of course I want all of our guest views on that but I'm gonna go to you first with how would you define success oh man that right there it can be summed up in many many different things but you know my success in the way that I would see success is just to see that we see the abolishment of slavery because and I and I stay on that stay stuck on that not thinking important that America listen to what we're saying as far as the Boston of slavery we're not asking for the abolishment of prisons because I live in prison I've been in all the maximum-security prisons in the state of Alabama I have been involved in violence my entire life inside of the prison there are guys and women that I'm sure that probably never should be ever back into society again I'm sure I hate to have to say that but I have to look at things but I say in an on by at that point but in every aspect of what we're doing if we abolish slavery and do away with a slavery call that gives the government the leeway to do what they're doing as far as placing um legislation upon our legislators to pass these laws just to fill up these prisons just to put bodies in here so that they can make money then a lot of the problems are going to go away such as the poor medical the overcrowding the understaffing it's going to go away there's going to be no need for the what they call nowadays mass incarceration there's going to be no need to put my people and they're gonna dinner gonna start focus on the actual rehabilitating of individuals who need true rehabilitation and I pretty much I have a problem with how people so loosely used the word rehabilitation because if people really take a good understanding what the definition rehabilitate means tell me the first individual who is rehabilitative such as this Queen that's on talking about that she was a firefighter in California when she got out to my understanding she cannot work as a firefighter so how is that being rehabilitated and placed as the citizen that she was before she ever came to prison when you can't trust her to be a firefighter as a so-called free citizen but can trust her as a firefighter as a slave I don't understand I can't comprehend that so I'm asking that society come up with a new thinking pattern of what we're dealing with here today from aerelon yep we asked that same questions you make a good point and so we're working on legislation around that that will allow for a certain occupational licensing to be afforded to folks who have criminal records because a lot of licenses now bar you from being able to obtain those life and there are a lot of occupations for you from being able to obtain a license if you have a criminal record so we're working on legislation here in California to do away with that and so that folks have more access to getting into those jobs that they're actually trained for inside the prison show but remaining I'm just looking at pictures I hate your Shonda I'm just going to show our audience what we're talking about here there are firefighters in California right now who are inmates and if you look here and there and the right here firefighting you would not know that they're inmates there in exactly the same spaces that other firefighters are and they get paid a dollar an hour for their firefighting but when they get out with those skills that they already have they cannot then go and be professional firefighters but I do believe in Arizona that you can do that they do have a program in where you can work as a firefighter as an inmate and then when you leave you can join the firefighting profession if you have the qualifications so that's like thank you so that's that reason it's exactly why our audience is saying this is a revolving door we got this comment live on YouTube this is rain who says once you're a felon your sentence never truly ends even after you get out you can get a job and that's why prison has a revolving door so on that note I want to pass you something crystal because we got a video comment from another former inmate this is Kevin Steele and this is what he talks about keeping on that same point have a listen I blame capitalism who what happened to the buffers and leadership sitting in South Carolina because the prison was overpopulated and only is why the prisons over popularly because of the money the stuff of nut bodies instead of prisoners really get more money for each individual and if the if capitalism wasn't at the root that would have never happened we are actually we are looking to shut down these prison systems these industrial systems that's inside the prison system we were looking to get better health care we're looking to do different different on tactics that will leave her better living but ultimately we're looking for human rights for both and sisters that's incarcerated crystal think you know the brother who just made that comment was absolutely on point you know capitalism is certainly the fuel behind the the state of the prison systems that we see today the mass number of people being incarcerated and warehouse as we mentioned this strike is really a it's really about human rights and of course you know the Thirteenth Amendment and the slavery aspect is a key component of it but I do just want to remind people that there's the whole list of pin demands that encompass other aspects long term strategies and that really let out at me there was some of the demands were about immediate improvements in living conditions in prison for instance if you're never given parole what point is there for you to even bother to be a well to your fellow inmates if you have grievances and no one listened to your grievances what's the point so there's that very practical information and and demands but also some larger big-picture demands how about the justice system how about racial justice how about not incarcerating so many african-americans so many minorities all of that is in the demands as well I know Chandra that you've been trying to get in go ahead what did you want to add yeah I just wanted to piggyback on Swift's excellent point here which is the stunning hypocrisy of the system companies like Victoria's Secret and Starbucks and other people can contract for prison labor because they can pay very low wages to the men and women who work inside these facilities yet when they are released as Roe Maryland point out it out ninety-five percent of men and women in prison will be released one day they can't get a job with that same company so my big point is to I would like ideally if I could bring out success from this strike it would be for these companies to know that if they're good and if we're good enough to work for them while we're inside we're also good enough to work for them one more outside and that's a big disconnect that I see it's connected to the capitalism points that that crystal made and and Kevin did but I think that that if we could come out with that understanding I would define that as success let me just pray three that's part of the prison industrial complex yeah but if we get back to the equal pay for equal wages and there was a joint venture between these corporations and these prisons and folks were earning the same amount of money as folks on the outside we would have that I think we would have access to to employment on the outside with just a biggest barrier to to recidivist yes and when people watching on YouTube Swift Rosholt I just want to play this to you I want you to be able to hear this there was a national prison strike in 2016 one of the organizers Bennu Hannibal Rossum spoke to Al Jazeera's documentary series fault lines this is just rushing talking to him about the punishment he got for organizing that prison strike have a listen officials placed bender when solitary for failure to obey orders and for using a cell phone to talk to the media he was supposed to be there for 15 days that was eight months ago today binu is still in solitary we try to find out what happened to Bennett who's still in Alabama in a place called Bessemer in a segregation unit he got in trouble for talking to the media Swift you're on the phone to us people gonna be wondering how you on the phone in prison well I tell you I have to repeat what my brother can edit justice there one time we just utilize so this is a warfare that we live every day and we have a we are struggling and fighting for our life on the frontier so we just utilize every tool that we can you utilize and you know over the years we have become smarter and started utilizing them against them and ADOC along with other agencies throughout the state oh they try to turn around and use that against us and say that many of the things that go on inside the prisons over these over cellphones but it is a problem but it's not a problem to us and it's not something that we are putting y'all violence towards I mean it becomes a problem because of the exposure that we arise okay just as we appreciate you being on the show Chandra and crystal we're about to run out of YouTube time so we have we have to wrap up elegantly so we don't all just fall off the edge of the Internet here's Malik of the wrap up I will give the last question or the last comment rather to someone on YouTube this is capo who writes in giving us context for this conversation saying currently incarceration is just a punishment it's far from rehabilitation the money spent on holding someone for a year is more than a normal wage oh this conversation isn't over yet but we bring it to you on day one of the National Prison strike of 2018 thank you guys for helping us have this conversation we will see you online
