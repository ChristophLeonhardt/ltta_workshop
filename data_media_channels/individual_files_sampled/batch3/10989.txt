McGrath's seem to be falling out of love with capitalism with recent polls showing they are now more positive about socialism and with some saying the party is out of touch with this traditional base Arty's caleb Maupin went to see what's driving this new trend polls show that among Democratic voters socialism is becoming more popular than capitalism according to the latest poll less than half of Democrats have a favorable view of the economic system long considered to be the American Way meanwhile 57% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism which until recently was a forbidden word in American discourse this is what leftist intellectuals logic says about the trend not only so-called lower working classes feel betrayed by the system but also many middle class academics intellectuals and so on and so on it's a kind of a general widespread awareness that the American system doesn't function the way people expected to function now this shift in views is manifesting itself with the rise in popularity of figures like veteran senator Bernie Sanders and progressive candidate for Congress Alexandria Acacio Cortez now many voices are speaking up and saying that the new trend could be disastrous for the Democratic Party but the shift among the liberal rank-and-file continues Oh KKK so why are Democrats losing faith in capitalism we decided to talk to people here on the streets of New York and find out now a new poll came out that showed that only 47 percent of Democrats favored capitalism what's driving this shift in public opinion Trump I think a lot of it has to do with Trump because of his policies I think we're going further to the left than we should be going because of his policies I see him as being overly wealthy overly influential and kind of not allowing a little guy to succeed which I see capitalism as being the way that they're portraying capitalism in the media now is are you signing up shining a bad light on it you feel like Trump is causing this rise in socialist sentiments among Democrats I wouldn't say so I think he he's not really like influencing it that much I feel like you know the health care system especially the driving costs and even of the Affordable Care Act it's just not working out well now among those who favor socialism the top priority concerns seem to be affordable health care and education however Trump's embrace of all things capitalist seems to have an influence on those who are now changing their understanding of the word socialism today seems to embody sets of programs by which the government helps regulate and in some instances run and pay for social programs focused on basic population needs in health education housing and employment more leftist anti-capitalist signal from Bernie Sanders and his movement and so on and so on and so now they are paying the price so whether it's Trump or just overall dissatisfaction resentment against what has long been considered to be core American values is growing caleb Maupin RT New York you
