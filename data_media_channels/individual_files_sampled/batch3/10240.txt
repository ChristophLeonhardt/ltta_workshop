US Special Forces soldiers subjected himself to waterboarding to try and show that it's not a form of torture Tim Kennedy posted a facebook video of being mocked drowned and then explained his main reason for doing it imagine me having a tank does this look like torture to you guys it doesn't look like torture to me either the reason we're doing this at amazing hero is running for our beds been appointed to be the director the CIA well waterboarding is an interrogation technique that's being used by the CIA many human rights groups and the United Nations say it does amount to torture it can cause serious health consequences like brain lung damage even death or worse the newly appointed CIA director mentioned in Tim Kennedy's videos been widely criticized after allegations of her involvement in enhanced interrogation techniques which included waterboarding what's more President Trump who chose Gina has more for the job as often said that torture works we discussed the waterboarding video with former Guantanamo detainee Mazen beg he says it's a technique that amounts to torture no matter what one soldier's thoughts are on it and many people can can withstand different types of torture for example I know an individual might be able to bear the pain of having his arm twisted or having a cleaner nail pulled out compared to others who can't but it's not based upon an individual's ability to be able to take that torture or not it's according to the definition of the law international law interestingly just recently the two people captured by the Syrian Defense Forces who are alleged to be a Waterboro who allegedly waterboarded their captives their American captives from Isis also waterboarded there are um are they captives so here the Americans are saying that these two individuals are could have committed war crimes which include waterboarding so this kind of notion of it isn't torture it's only torture when we say it is when it affects us is complete hypocrisy and it's complete and it opposes more importantly international law which in which outlaws torture completely and it says that not only is physical torture outlawed barroso is psychological port of the use or to false confessions out of people
