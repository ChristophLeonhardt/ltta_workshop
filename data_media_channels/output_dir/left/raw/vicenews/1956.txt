volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> is startling to Europe because</font>

they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now starting to see</font>

Europe and it's not gonna stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

17
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,640
that's why it's such a touchy subject

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
for European politicians the fact is

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,270
immigration is unpopular do you see you

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,670
know governments may be hiring mo ass or

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,000
groups like it to take the political

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,350
risk off of their hands so that the

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,840
rescue goes to professionals and provide

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,440
it as a service yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,460
way things should work is that

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">individuals should look at something and</font>

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,650
say I can fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then secondly</font>

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,659
people other individuals should look at

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say I like what he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing I</font>

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,600
think governments are the tail end of

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,220
the decision chain governments are risk

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,659
adverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments look at polls</font>

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,880
they're not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out in the limb</font>

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,909
and do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> arbitrarily what he's</font>

35
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing is very humanitarian so there's a</font>

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,840
difference between saying oh I want to

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">end malaria so I'm gonna spend millions</font>

38
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,619
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars coming up with ideas but you</font>

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,299
don't end malaria he's actually saving

40
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,979
people's lives so last year there's

41
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">3,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people on this planet that will</font>

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,729
exist this year that may not have

43
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,400
existed last year so direct action is

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,820
really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most fundamental force for</font>

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,040
change you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that and</font>

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">say wow you know that guy thinks deeply</font>

47
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,450
enough about that to commit his own

48
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,490
resource or funds we're gonna slowly

49
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,340
take you about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a time over to the</font>
