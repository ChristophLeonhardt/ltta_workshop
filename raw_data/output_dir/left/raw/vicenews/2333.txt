00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,800
hi I'm Michael Moynihan a sometimes

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,830
correspondent for vice news and this

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,340
week we launched a new documentary

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,070
called propaganda over Pyongyang okay my

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,340
question is what would be the risk of

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,320
these balloons being found by North

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,390
Korean citizens what would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrist</font>

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,800
of their lives if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were caught with</font>

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
any of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the penalty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,020
because there is no court system in any

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,850
sort of sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would understand</font>

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,489
it that there is a codified penalty for

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,420
this so execution yes imprisonment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,070
always punishment at<font color="#CCCCCC"> parkers press</font>

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,260
conference that the

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,489
counter-demonstrators actually have like

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,160
reasons in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform or do you think</font>

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were influenced by North Korea</font>

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,719
there's no way for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know a lot of</font>

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
people told us that these guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> North</font>

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,170
Korean Stooges so we couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,149
sense of what they were there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so you</font>

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,109
know we went and talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

24
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,069
obviously the answers didn't strike any

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,439
of us as being straightforward and

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,930
honest my question is do you personally

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,640
think that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an effective form of</font>

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,010
protest and that it actually helps North

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,720
Koreans<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the Western Way of</font>

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,090
life so another defector we met and we

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,630
didn't use this um he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked</font>

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">him I said what do you guys sending in</font>

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,090
and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this USB drives film soap</font>

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,460
operas the rest of it he said no I have

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,680
been filming inside a south korean

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,900
supermarket just walking through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,060
camera filming<font color="#E5E5E5"> South Korean supermarkets</font>

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,700
putting that as an avi file or whatever

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,110
it might be onto a thumb drive in

40
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,579
smuggling this was not balloons

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,710
smuggling it in over the Chinese border

42
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,750
it was important for them because these

43
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,500
are people that were North Koreans to

44
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">understand what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happening</font>

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,259
in the south so uh you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did all this</font>

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,509
work you came to South Korea<font color="#E5E5E5"> you went</font>

47
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,130
out to the balloon drops and then it

48
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,630
turned out that actually the interview

49
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,670
was not in the balloons yeah how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel about that you know it was really</font>

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us because no one told us</font>

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,090
we got there on Monday we were told the

53
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,080
balloon launch is gonna be later in the

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,069
week and then you know bleary-eyed

55
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,409
ends and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> jet-lagged we're about</font>

56
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hotel and they say</font>

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,069
okay we're driving north to pod you and

58
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,030
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to launch the balloons</font>

59
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,159
tonight so it just hit us like wow

60
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,430
there's the banner of the interview and

61
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,290
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next day we find out that</font>

62
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,329
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there and just by the way</font>

63
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a technical perspective the entire</font>

64
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,629
time I'm sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to the</font>

65
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:33,739
camera like wow we're sending the

66
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,879
interview North Korea but we weren't and

67
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,019
that's because park I think he was

68
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:43,730
pressured in some way into not doing it

69
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,370
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was curious he asked the defectors</font>

70
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,489
about their long-term vision for beyond

71
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,189
the balloon launch how this would play

72
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:56,719
out is totally beyond anyone and I think

73
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's important to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that</font>

74
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,829
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dictatorship this is</font>

75
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,909
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> country that ranks 165 out of 165</font>

76
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:07,549
countries in freedom indexes all across

77
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,400
the board these are people that have

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,139
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> so brutalized by the Kim dynasty</font>

79
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,049
crime family that re integration is I

80
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,540
mean I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to the point where</font>

81
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,799
it's going to be hard for them because

82
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,109
this is worse so I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to the</font>

83
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,519
point where that has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out</font>

84
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,750
we got this really good tweet from

85
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,879
arturo while we're alive or<font color="#E5E5E5"> tara wants</font>

86
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,909
to know if we're entering a new era of

87
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,759
propaganda so you know propaganda is

88
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,040
something that has always existed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,769
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in its a new era in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense</font>

90
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,009
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology we can actually crack</font>

91
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,629
North Korea I mean sending balloons over

92
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,609
but you're setting balloons over of much

93
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">more explosive and inflammatory stuff</font>

94
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:51,739
like South Korean soap operas I mean

95
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,269
that might be what brings the regime

96
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,689
though thank you for watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> our piece</font>

97
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:59,540
