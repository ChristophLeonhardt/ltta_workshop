49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">over 25 minutes add twenty five whole</font>

50
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,390
minutes not one police officer bother to

51
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,020
tell me that I was in the press area and

52
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,970
then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me eventually they'll do</font>

53
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,799
it through what like 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us and they</font>

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,360
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother to tell any of us in there</font>

55
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,560
was very obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we weren't breasts</font>

56
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,329
that we were in the press area I was

57
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,820
like cheese thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really nice</font>

busy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's dress but they were</font>

60
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,850
standing right there doing nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

61
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,140
watching us and kind of swine to each

62
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,310
other I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was wondering where this money</font>

63
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,330
to another when I was going to actually

64
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,670
ask is there carefully standard but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I</font>

65
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,780
did

66
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,120
and by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time everywhere else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,060
best posted who all filled up so I was

68
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">like slightly grumpy when they told me</font>

69
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go somewhere so I ended up standing</font>

70
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,280
if you know Lester's got in front of the

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,980
cattle radio area but I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front</font>

72
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,959
at that point I was about four rows if

73
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,360
you back behind this huge group

74
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,160
professional autograph hunters who are

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,950
perhaps most vicious creatures on the

76
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,440
planet yeah and I was stuck behind a

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,030
huge bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> excess oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> god this is</font>

78
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,510
awful it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worst thing ever</font>

79
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,830
but ever it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an experience I</font>

80
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,660
was tempted to go home at some point but

81
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,730
I didn't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to everyone around me</font>

82
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,680
that's because that's what I do somehow

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">with all like everyone will be rounded</font>

84
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,730
up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like the third row of people</font>

85
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,080
to the front but they're still you know

86
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,080
autograph hunters and crazy fan people

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,580
and me kind of yeah surrounded but it

88
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,380
helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to keep people warm I guess we</font>

89
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,170
immediately saw when Leonardo DiCaprio

90
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,970
was going to ride because it's very car

91
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,190
arrived first of like of bodyguards and

92
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,620
security people PR people and then a

93
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,930
second car turned up and he was in it

94
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,540
and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course everyone surged forward</font>

95
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,519
which is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> painful if you put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

96
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">premiere and we've been stuck behind a</font>

97
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,769
gate in the back is like it's extreme

98
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,019
pain and somehow like one<font color="#E5E5E5"> the as the</font>

99
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">auto garage is like pushed his job to</font>

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to the front one of them like</font>

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
elbowed 500 people are the way just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">n kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was making such a big deal about</font>

103
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,120
pushing everyone other way that he

104
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,970
created this lemon huge gap in the front

105
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,269
which like person's eyes which none of

106
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,130
the professional autograph hunters nor

107
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,130
the crazy fan girls seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to notice so I</font>

108
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like and I ended up pretty much</font>

109
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,100
at the front by the gate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

110
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,410
minutes before Leonardo DiCaprio came

111
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,609
and side round thus and I was like oh my

112
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,230
God he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and I was really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excited</font>

113
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,320
because I've loved pretty much every

114
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,420
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> film he's in especially romeo</font>

115
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,810
giulia and titanic is underrated and

116
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,250
it's not the best film in the world but

117
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,000
it's bloody clothes and what do you
