also making wild promises like when at last night's rally President Trump with the chairman of the houses tax writing committee on the spot promising Congress will quote put in a 10% income tax cut sometime next week after White House reporters questioned him about it on his way to Houston yesterday sometime in the next week or week and a half to wait a resolution where's where to put it we're giving a that's on top of the tax decrease Ted is leading the charge in Congress for more tax cuts fact I just left Kevin Brady by the way how good is Kevin Brady easier we're going to be putting in a 10% tax cut for middle-income families it's going to be put in next with 10% tax cut Kevin Brady is working on it we've been working on it for a few months this is for middle income people or middle income people a big tax cut 10% we'll be putting it in next now the Democrats take over I can't speak I'm sorry Kevin were putting in next week to ten percent reduction in middle income taxes right next week okay he promised in front of 22,000 people I don't need that he promised to me that's good he says next week a ten percent yes he might as well promise next week Willie that he's gonna build a rocket ship to Mars made out of caramel chocolate and candy cane dust it's it's but in poor Kevin Brady he's sitting there going please don't don't do this to me just please Jesus telling to stop pointing at me I mean Kevin Brady's putting this horrible position to lie in front of 22,000 people you can't even draft a bill like that in a week Willie it's an important what you said if your Congress is not in session Congress is not in session there will be no bill passed President Trump mentioned the tax cut by the way for the first time on Saturday some Republican leaders have expressed skepticism on how to pay for it given this year 17% increase in the deficit in Jackie I would remind our viewers that Republicans passed a massive tax cut ten months ago in December where they could have included a middle cut a middle tax excuse me a middle class tax cut and now President Trump is floating the idea implausibly two weeks before the election yeah and I just want to you know get back to this whiff of desperation though really quickly that we were you all were talking about and just explicitly connect the dots here which is that I think what we're sensing is that the president realizes that if he loses single party control on the hill he is facing impeachment a slew of potential investigations from House Oversight along with you know the total upheaval of all of the policies he's implemented and so this rhetoric that we're seeing these ideas that he's sort of pulling out of thin air at 10% middle-class tax cut that's all that it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone because I think what also the president realizes is that you know he is a creature of habit and he understands that would put him over the edge in 2016 was this a difference and amplified rhetoric in immigration and in and really got the base on his side appeals to racism used it before he's using it now and Jackie brings up a fantastic point gene we're sitting over money wait wait wait what's this guy why could why is this guy freaking out so much yeah when things have kind of been breaking the Republicans way over the past we said Jackie just said it if Democrats win the house by one seat they've got subpoena power yeah they can look they can subpoena they can get his tax records they can look at all of his dealings with Russia they can look at all of his financial dealings with Saudi Arabia they can understand why the rest of the world is shunning Saudi Arabia but Donald Trump is hugging a murderer where the bloody saw saw in his hand they can all of these things that don't Helsinki all these things that don't make so much sense to us right now well if the Democrats win the house by what see just one we're gonna know everything we're gonna know a whole lot Joe and obviously he's panicked about that I would I would what all this suggests to me is that there is internal polling maybe White House polling that yet suggests that things haven't broken did breaking all that well for Republicans the last couple weeks that it's not as as rosy a picture as they have been painting publicly and that in fact you know they're panicked that it's this gonna go this way now I'm gonna be really brief because I because I know we're planning to go to our correspondent who's covering the California riots is that right yes hold on Willie Willie all night to the to the correspondent let who has been covering the California riots Willie oh wait no they're covering the Dodgers Red Sox opener tonight and there are no riots I don't think there may be rioting if Chris Sale pitches the way Barnicle says he's gonna pitch but certainly no riots or not the sanctuary cities as the president said no not not at all and you know Mika yeah we've said this we said this after Kavanagh Democrats depressed for good reason because my god the party did such a horrible job during the Kavanagh hearings especially at the end there is a dip down in the polls but you know you start looking at polls coming out of West Virginia where Joe Manchin just tearing it up we're gonna show these polls in a little bit another poll out of Florida showing that Bill Nelson is over 50% that's really significant things are starting to break back Democrats way and well it's freaking Donald Trump out well and they they're not covering the riots they're covering the big lie served up with little lies medium-size lies all sorts of lies we live in a time when our fellow citizens have all-time low levels of trust in our institutions including the government most politicians live from time to time I think it's fair to say but Donald Trump is different and we need to put this into perspective he likes to sell himself as world-class at everything well this is one area where he is world class we have never seen anything quite like this in American history a president who seems to prefer to lie when the truth would be just fine but most dangerously he lies to hurt people he lies to deceive voters into becoming enraged over a world of make-believe there are no riots or massive illegal immigrant voting in California no Democratic organizers of the Honduran Caravan there is no evidence that Middle Easterners are hiding inside that Caravan there's no evidence that Trump is committed to protecting health insurance for coverage for pre-existing conditions and no tax relief soon for middle-class family all lies real-world lies that Trump freely repeats over and over again on Twitter at rallies and right to the face of professional journalists who know they are lies and call him on them we could spend our three hours with you every day running through his various falsehoods his crowd sizes the number of judges he's appointed Brett Kavanaugh is academic conduct credentials I could go on and on and on wait but Mickey he says that he's appointed more federal judges than everybody since George Washington he is not and or something about everybody since Bill Clinton no not even that there's something truly wrong with a leader who lies so much about everything but the lies about public policy the lies meant to divide our country to hurt specific people or groups of people those lies should disgust other elected Republicans where are you and they create a reality that everyone who votes for a Trump backed Republican in this election needs to own they need to understand what they're voting for lies still ahead on Morning Joe Turkey's president just laid out the case that Saudi Arabia planned in advance the murder of Washington Post columnist to
