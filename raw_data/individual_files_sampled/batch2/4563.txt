de 6:30 one of the Trump administration and again tonight the president was performing in front of an audience at one of his rallies again tonight relying on the talking points and rallying cries that have come out of the ugly Cavanaugh fight and the notion the right is pushing hard that those on the Left are part of an angry mob Monday night in the East Room of the White House we achieved a tremendous victory for our nation we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh did he get treated badly and unfairly or what from the moment Brett Kavanaugh was announced an angry Democrat mob was on a mission to resist obstruct delay demolish and destroy him Republicans believe in the rule of law not the rule of the mob the people of Ohio can save America from radical Democrats good time to remember and let's not forget it was a week that started at least in primetime Monday evening with the president's apology on behalf of the nation as the family of the newest justice and the eight other sitting justices looked on on behalf of our nation I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Cavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure now five days later and tonight there are new polling numbers showing 41 percent of respondents say they approve of the new justices confirmation that's opposed to 51% who do not this week also brought in a new test for the Trump administration hurricane Michael laid waste to portions of Florida's Gulf Coast the storm hit the region just hours before the president held his second campaign rally of the week in Pennsylvania there were questions about the president's decision not to cancel the rally and now his administration is faced with the task of recovery which no doubt will be watched closely because tonight there are Americans who need food and water on an urgent basis this is a reminder federal storm response is neither symbolic nor theoretical tensions within the administration also competed for the president's attention a number of reports indicate Trump is actually shopping for a replacement for his Attorney General Jeff Sessions he appears however to have decided to hang on to his deputy Rod Rosenstein at least for now you know the rumor is the day after the midterms you're gonna fire him and you're gonna fire the Attorney General well I actually get along well with rod the president also revealed this week he's losing a member of his cabinet when US ambassador to the UN nikki Haley confirms she's leaving in Jan you weary she's widely seen as a future Republican presidential candidate potentially a threat to the current president something she seems clearly aware of for all of you that are gonna ask about 2020 no I'm not running for 2020 Trump is also under increasing pressure following the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal khashoggi in Turkey this week khashoggi who's been critical of Saudi Arabia's government vanished after entering the Saudi consulate their Turkish authorities are convinced he was murdered Trump has boasted of his ties to Saudi Arabia's King and he has taken some heat this week for what some saw as a lackluster response let's say to this crisis today the president struck a somewhat different tone we're gonna find out what happened with respect to the terrible situation in Turkey having to do with Saudi Arabia and the reporter this is a very serious thing and we're looking at it in a very serious manner amid everything else that was happening perhaps the most enduring image of the week was the president and Kanye West together in the Oval Office at the resolute desk let's stop worrying about the future all we really have is today we just have today over and over and over again the eternal return the hero's journey and Trump is on his hero's journey right now best believe we are gonna make America great he could speak for me any time he wants smart cookie smart he gets it on that let's bring in our leadoff panel on a Friday night Phillip Rucker Pulitzer Prize winning White House bureau chief for The Washington Post Jackie Calmes White House editor for the Los Angeles Times and Cynthia oxy a career federal prosecutor former assistant US attorney veteran of the Justice Department and having known her for about 25 years I'm happy to say she is a newly minted MSNBC legal analyst good evening welcome to you all Phil you get to go first and that is I'm gonna ask you to have in this new cycle lean way back have perspective over five whole days what kind of a week was it for this president and this White House well Brian this morning I was talking to one of the presidents top advisors at the White House who joked that someone could write an entire book about this week that there's been so many ups and downs and so much happening starting with the historic Supreme Court fight that came to an end on Monday that was a huge victory for the conservative movement for President Trump it was something he'd campaigned on and it's something that Republicans are banking on helping them keep their Senate majority in the midterm elections three weeks from now but really I mean they're they're just so many highs and lows here what we've seen is the president just becoming so much freer and looser he's talking to reporters multiple times a day he's saying whatever is on his mind the impact be damned and you saw that extraordinary Oval Office moment with Kanye West but then you see the serious international crises that he's facing with the disappearance and alleged murder suspected murder of my colleague Jamal Khashoggi in in Istanbul the administration the president has said he wants to get to the bottom of this but has not indicated that there's any retaliation in store for Saudi Arabia or any sort of effort to to push back indeed the Treasury secretary Stephen minuchin is planning to attend that investor conference in Riyadh Saudi Arabia next week that so many companies have dropped their participation in Jackie let's talk about matters domestic so a celebratory mood at the White House of grievances before every rally crowd you had the Kanye moment and yet this storm rolls through the Florida Panhandle something that hasn't been set off and we should go ahead and say this didn't hit a lot of ritzy areas these are regular folks these are a lot of working poor folks and a lot of people for whom this was it this was their piece of paradise on the Florida Gulf Coast on some of the prettiest coastline we have in this country is this susceptible to blowback because we are hearing interviews with people saying we're going to need food and water and it's getting desperate well the president has said that you know they'll get everything they need and this is really Trump country there and you know I think that he's planning to go as soon as possible but this week was really disconcerting the extent to which as as Phil was saying that the president was so on such a high and and there were all these moments his 47 minute interview with Fox & Friends and the Kanye and Jim Brown luncheon and three rallies there'll be a fourth one tomorrow in Richmond Kentucky he was in Ohio tonight and at all of these it's like you know there's a sort almost pro forma just check the box reference to the hurricane victims where I think the current toll is 17 I hesitate to give a number because it's rising and it's really you know in some ways I think to myself it's good so many people have don't have power because they can't see that the president and the president many of them support is seems to be thinking about everything else Cynthia let's start with a poll here because we so often do has the Cavanaugh debate made you more likely to support the Democrats or Republicans what I'm getting out here is a gender gap among women Democrats 40% Republicans 24 a lot of no response here in this bowl but Cinthia the question to you coming from the law as you do was this party willing to sow the seeds of an increasing gender gap to get the victory on Kavanagh well it looks like that but that's you know that's not really my lane what I can say from a legal point of view as a woman and as a legal person looking at it there was a lot at stake here in this Kavanagh appointment for women there's not only the whether or not women will be heard when their sexual assault which apparently for the Republican Party they will not be if it gets in the way of power and there's also the real threat to women in roe v wade that that you know Justice Kennedy was the swing vote on the cases that came after roe v wade that have protected a woman's right to privacy and it does not appear the justice Cavanagh will vote the same way so roe v wade will either be overturned outright or Rovi wade will be so altered and what is acceptable as an undue burden will be so changed that you won't even recognize it as a right to privacy in many states in this country and women know that and that's why the Cavanaugh win for the Republicans may not be a long-term win win for them because women are afraid of what the Republicans are giving them hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
