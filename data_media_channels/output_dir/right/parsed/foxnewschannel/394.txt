THIS WEEKEND?
>> GOOD MORNING.
TWO THINGS.
FIRST OF ALL YOU'LL SEE A REAL
FULL-COURT PRESS BY WHITE HOUSE
OFFICIALS.
A LOT OF AVAILABILITY AND SOUND
IN SUPPORT NOT JUST OF THE
JUDGE, BUT ALSO IN SUPPORT OF
THOSE WHO MAY BE ON THE FENCE
IN THE SENATE.
I THINK THE SECOND THING IS
REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL.
YOU WILL SEE A BIT OF A
RELIANCE ON THE F.B.I. REPORT
AGAIN TO BOLSTER THE ARGUMENT.
A MAN WHO SERVED ON THE BENCH
MORE THAN TWO DECADES SHOULD
NOT HAVE THIS ALLEGATION AND AN
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION KEEP
HIM FROM SERVING ON THE U.S.
SUPREME COURT.
THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT
IT ONCE AGAIN THIS MORNING.
HE SAID THIS.
THE HARSH AND UNFAIR TREATMENT
OF JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS
HAVING AN INCREDIBLE -- AN
INCREDIBLE UPWARD IMPACT ON
VOTERS.
THE PEOPLE GET IT FAR BETTER
THAN MOST POLITICIANS.
MORE IMPORTANTLY OR MOST
IMPORTANTLY, THIS GREAT LIFE
CANNOT BE RUINED BY MEAN AND
DESPICABLE DEMOCRATS AND
TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED
ALLEGATIONS.
THERE YOU SEE IT RIGHT THERE.
TO BE SURE, THERE IS A
POLITICAL ASPECT TO THIS
CONFIRMATION BATTLE.
BUT I THINK MORE CRUCIALLY THE
ARGUMENT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE
OF DAYS, BILL, WILL BE ABOUT
THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT AND
THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCESS
WHICH IS INCLUDED, AS YOU KNOW,
A BEVY OF LATE ALLEGATIONS AND
QUESTIONS ABOUT JUDGE
KAVANAUGH'S FITNESS.
>> ALL THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS
GET THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED
THROUGHOUT ONE'S CAREER.
HE HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH SOME
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN
GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST 25
YEARS WITH A VERY HIGH-PROFILE
CAREER.
AND ALL THE FOLKS THAT ARE
DEMANDING THIS TYPE OF AN
INVESTIGATION IN THE SENATE ARE
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE ALREADY
PLEDGED TO VOTE NO.
THEY WANT TO DELAY THE PROCESS.
>> THAT IS RAJ SHAH.
WE ANTICIPATE GETTING MORE
SOUND WITH HIM AND GRABBED HIM
ON HIS WAY AFTER THAT INTERVIEW.
AS I GET MORE SOUND I'LL PASS
THAT ALONG.
WE CAN ALWAYS TELL YOU THIS,
THE PRESIDENT GOT THE REPORT --
THE WHITE HOUSE GOT THE REPORT
AFTER 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING.
WE DO KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS
BEEN BRIEFED ON IT, BILL.
WE DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS
ACTUALLY READ IT HIMSELF YET.
>> Bill: WE HEARD THE F.B.I.
REACHED OUT TO NINE INDIVIDUALS.
FORD IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
HER TEAM ISN'T HAPPY WITH THAT.
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE
CHARACTERIZING THAT, KEVIN?
>> YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE DR. FORD
HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY
INTERVIEWED FOR THE WORLD TO
SEE UNDER OATH ON CAPITOL HILL.
SO GIVEN THAT, IT'S IMPORTANT,
THEY SAY, TO ALLOW THE F.B.I.
TO SORT OF UNPACK OTHER
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT
THERE.
THE BUREAU COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO
INTERVIEW HER, THEY DID NOT.
ABOUT WHICH HER LAWYER SAID
THIS.
AN F.B.I. SUPPLEMENTAL
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION THAT
DIDN'T INCLUDE AN INTERVIEWED
OF FORD OR WITNESSES WHO
CORROBORATE HER TESTIMONY CAN'T
BE CALLED AN INVESTIGATION.
WE'RE PROFOUNDLY DISAPPOINTED
THAT AFTER THE TREMENDOUS
SACRIFICE SHE MADE IN COMING
FORWARD THOSE DIRECTING THE
F.B.I. INVESTIGATION WERE NOT
INTERESTED IN SEEKING THE TRUTH.
IT IS EXPECTED, BILL, THAT THE
PRESIDENT WILL GET AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT
THAT REPORT FIRSTHAND HERE THIS
