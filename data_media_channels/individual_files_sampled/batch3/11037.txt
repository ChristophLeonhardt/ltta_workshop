now plans to change French laws to give stricter punishments for child sex abuse errs have fallen foul of experts who say it will make it the problem were sorry Charlotte Dubinsky has more in March France announced that it was going to legislate to curb sexual violence to cut down on sexism and included in that legislation was due to be an age of consent for sexual activity here in France and that age of consent was set to be at 15 now the reason that element of the law was put in because there was outrage after two cases emerged of eleven-year-old girls who were deemed not to have been raped by adult men because they're not being cursed they've not been threatened there had been no violence or surprise when that incident had taken place well now the law is being debated in the National Assembly on Tuesday and that element the age of consent of 15 has now been taken out of this law critics say that that means it's been watered down that it offers less protection for children and actually creates new legal loopholes for child rapists this is what they've said according to article 2 child abuse could be considered an offence not a crime mr. kusuda and mr. president there are 250 people who demand the law be repealed well they've now launched a petition against that revision of the age of consent and it's garnered more than 400,000 people supporting that to not be changed well those who'd argued for the change say they needed to take out that age of consent because they said it would infringe on the defendants presumption of innocence now that's led to some heated debate in the National Assembly already in one session on Monday Cornell and Luke when they still deliver when you read and reread this law from one point and then another when you are assured that he have read and understood it all we may well think that nothing happened at all as if there was no me to movement as if all these shocking and appalling testimonies did not provoke any reaction from the government ferma I reviewed the Intolerable flippin senior analysis of the text of the law that we are proposing well critics say if the law is passed without that age of consent it will mean that France will be one of the only countries in Europe which does not have a legal defined age of consent and they've also said that it means that it could pose a real danger if rapists are actually convicted under lesser charges meaning that they won't be seen as rapists by society and the protections necessary to make sure that they don't commit such an act again won't be in place you
