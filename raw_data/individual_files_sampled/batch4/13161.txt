big money Democrats who gave over a billion dollars to the campaign of Hillary Clinton have asked the Democrat Party to examine why their candidate lost to some orange guy who basically spent 17 bucks on a hat that said make America great again with great spell gr8 EE in response the Democratic Party has prepared this exhaustive report quote after a searching moral inventory of ourselves and our own actions we have determined that the reason Hillary Clinton lost the election had nothing to do with ourselves or our own actions clearly the outcome was skewed when Vladimir Putin and an army of angry white men hacked into Hillary Clinton's private emails by using the dark Russian / white man technology of looking over her shoulder while she was using her cell phone these emails gave voters the false impression that Hillary was actually who she was instead of who she was pretending to be at this point Julian Assange kidnapped John Podesta and forced him at gunpoint to become a cynical and corrupt agent of a Democrat machine that no longer cared about the good of the people but only about consolidating and holding on to power Podesta's emails were then smuggled to Russia where Putin released his winged monkeys to distribute them among the populace causing Hillary to release a loud screeching noise that turned out to be her normal speaking voice faced with the prospect of listening to that voice for four more years voters apparently chose to vote for Trump rather than sticking knitting needles up their noses and swirling them around until they destroyed the Hearing Centers of their brains at the very same time FBI director James Comey was transformed from a man of unshakeable integrity who said Hillary was corrupt but so what into a sinister figure of evil who said Hillary was corrupt and he was going to investigate her after extensive thought we've determined that Comey is a stinky stinker who stinks so bad that stink should be renamed James Comey all of this combined with the ugly forces of racism that caused people to vote for Barack Obama in two elections just so they could then vote for Trump and suddenly spring out of the voting booth and shout haha we tricked you by voting for Barack Obama when we were really racists all along also we ate women this proves that still a country where people won't accept a woman leader even after she spent literally decades preparing for public office by steeping herself in dishonesty and corruption also the Electoral College is bad also the dog ate our ballots so all in all there are many reasons that contributing a billion dollars to the campaign of Hillary Clinton was pretty much the same as sticking the money in your ear and then lighting it on fire until your brain burned down none of those reasons had to do with the fact that Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate her ideas were destructive and her team was incompetent in fact forget we ever mentioned that we'd erase it but we're out of bleach pit trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin hooray your eye its mailbag day yeah woohoo and there and there is a Santa Piper what's that what the hell is that awesome it's a pipe for piping why does he look like Santa Claus no guys on drugs do we do tests anymore you stop the testing program all right all right it's also the shortest day of the year so that's it for me I'll see you tomorrow that's not what that means yeah great one you know I'm worried about I'm worried about the Queen of England the Queen of England is sex she has canceled her Christmas festivities if she's only like I think she's 115 years old I'm a little worried about the Clavin this weekend coming up that would be that would be the kind of kind of telling end to you have to brexit that would be the ultimate brexit I guess which she brexit so you know the stage well I hope she gets better I like the Queen all right we're gonna take a look you know this after this election the the commentary has been so hysterical that we want to take a look at some comic commentary finally the some of the pundits are beginning to calm down and we're getting some intelligent insights like this one our long national nightmare is starting with the electoral college presumably failing to do its duty as conceived under the Constitution we won't know officially until the votes are counted on January 6th Russia's puppet is probably now puppet elect so this changes everything no it changes nothing these facts are the building blocks of resistance he is still elected by a minority vote he is still wholly unfit for the job the man you would expect to find if you were searching for the person who could most quickly and efficiently destroy a democracy and maybe a planet he is still a moving breathing conflict-of-interest who will likely be guilty of impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors within hours if not minutes of his own inauguration he is still a textbook case of corrupt self dealing come to life he is still the leader of the most remarkable group of public serve yourself servants ever assembled and most importantly Trump is still at best the local distributor for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin hi this Keith Keith I love I want to play him every day you know Keith is like Madonna or Napoleon you don't even need his last name anymore it's just like Keith you know and but but it's okay he has solved the problem of the end of the universe the you know Trump is the end of the universe but he has figured out how we to fight defeat him here it is not using one word can be just as forceful as perpetually using another never address Trump as president he is Trump just Trump never president the title of president that we must protect for a happier and more honest time resistance means refusal resist peace I think the proper saying is Heil isn't it that'll be good this is great they've just the whole side has just been reduced to impotence you know on today on Twitter I woke up and on Twitter Jesus never existed was trending hashtag Jesus never I could just see Jesus you know Jesus be all like they say I never existed on Twitter anyway anyway I am getting to something here I oh I should have mentioned I forgot to mention on the mailbag you can send in your questions live if you subscribe the mailbag will come after we lose you on Facebook and YouTube but if you subscribe you can send in your questions live we already have questions in the box but we'll also take them what Trump is actually bringing some people together in mutual hysteria are our friend Glenn Beck I love Glenn Beck and Samantha bee who I can't even tolerate sat down together and they had this this charming discussions cut 9 my audience is going to think that I am crazy for sitting down with you my audience hates your guts my audience hates your guts nor my audience would like to stab you relentlessly in the eye my audio wants to kill me for normalizing a lunatic like yourself yes really okay now good for Glenn for sitting back down to bring us all together I guess but I you know a website called grabby and news which is actually a pretty good you know sort of aggregator of video and stuff they put out a list which is now on Drudge of the 10 most mortifying media moments of the year and I don't want to look at all of them but I want to take a look go back down memory lane because some of them are incredibly instructive and the first one is in fact Samantha B this is like number 10 on their list of the medium mortifying media moments of the year here's Samantha B for fingerprints it's pretty clear who ruined America white people I don't want to mention who invented dusting for fingerprints or inventing things but but you know this this is the big mean going on you know I think it was Sinclair Lewis who said something I'm quoting from memory but he said something like when fascism comes to America it's going to come wrapped in a flag and bearing the cross in other words it's gonna be this religious fascism but in fact when fascism comes to America it's gonna become wearing like a Christmas sweater and talking about evil white people I mean this is the kind of fascist reasoning that has become acceptable on the left they have always been the bigots the Democrat Party has always been the racist and now they think they're gonna solve all this by turning their racism against white people and we saw that mtv video yesterday where they're telling white people what they should how they should make resolutions to be better my problem is this here is an actual white person who I don't like Richard Spencer of the alt-right this kind of Nazi point of view here he is talking about his view of white people to be white is to be a striver a crusader an explorer and a conqueror we build we produce we go upward and we recognize the central lie of American race relations we don't exploit other groups we we don't gain anything from their presence they need us and the other way around now my problem with this white people meme that is now going through the media a big time and especially going through the youthful media is it's they're the same people they're the same as this clown what is your argument against this clown if you're going to accept the premise of racism your his argument is the white people are better your argument is that other people are better if that's that's it you're gonna what are you gonna do arm wrestle to the side that are you gonna fight it out I mean if you're gonna fight it out you're gonna find yourself outnumbered that's one thing but also like it's the whole logic that you're accepting so this is one of the things than looking back over the year has been just an absolute boil on the face of the media that they have accepted and allowed this concept that somehow racism is now okay as long as you turn it against the right people it's never okay so the entire premise that is that that's wrong and if we don't ditch the premise I know it's gonna be unfair I know people have been hurt by racism in the past who are never it's never going to be made good when we develop you know the DeLorean technology to go back into the past and write those wrongs will be able to solve that problem until then we're stuck with the way it is and the only way is to go forward in a new way another mortifying media moment from grabbing news was their coverage of Castro's death and this was truly appalling declared socialist he dramatically improved healthcare and literacy many saw positives education and healthcare for all racial integration you see the medicine system they are very proud of I'm quite certain that they're not celebrating his death in Cuba and he brought out here even Castro's critics praised his advances in health care and in education is considered even to this to this day the George Washington of his country Fidel continued to promote leftist movements in Latin America where he remained popular until his death he was a romantic figure when he came into power we American young young high school kids and kids in those days rooted like man for the gut he will be remembered remembered fondly you see donkey carts alongside cars trucks and buses in downtown Havana because that's exactly what they'd rather have transportation and he was a voracious reader very very smart he would be a figure that you'd look up to insights this guy's great love those donkey carts what'd he want a caddy or donkey card oh yeah I think the donkey cart works for me you know this is another crime the media has been committing through the year and it's of course not just this year but we're looking back over the mortifying moments of the media this year the normalizing of this philosophy that is an evil per se common you know it doesn't matter anybody can do good things you know Hitler can make the trains run on times Mussolini can make the trains run on time Hitler can revivify the German economy it doesn't matter if the leadership if the form of leadership is evil per se it doesn't matter what good comes of it also the Cuban health care thing is a lie Cubans have a two-tier health care thing if you're a major member of the Communist Party you get good health care otherwise you take your donkey cart lucky card and they give you like they bleed you basically you know they give you some leeches you know it's just a total lie the poorest person in America has better health care than middle class there are no middle class people in communism because that's one of the things socialism does is it cuts the middle class but Castro was a mass murderer he was this is not I'm not talking about a war I'm not talking about people he may have killed during a rebellion against an previously bad government this is a guy who if you disagreed with him if you were gay if you if he didn't like you if you said something try to he tried to escape he lined you up against a wall and shot you there is no excuse there's no but after that sentence there is no but in American English after he killed thousands of people there is but doesn't come out that not grammar that's not American grammar so this is this is a an appalling shame I mean this is an evil evil man who died you know I don't want to be standing next to them when the Trump blows that's all I can tell you you know and and this is you know this is part of our media being stupid of not understanding that socialist socialism is wrong say because it takes your time and says that the government owns it and that is called slavery that is slavery in and of itself when your time belongs to somebody else you are a slave socialism is a bad per se Castro was a particularly bad example of it and it wasn't socialism anyway it was communism which is even worse all right we're gonna we're gonna say goodbye pause here say goodbye to our friends on Facebook and YouTube which
