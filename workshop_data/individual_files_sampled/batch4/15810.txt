remember how we being told time and time again that about 50% of gun crime is carried out thanks to legally registered guns that are being trafficked well talk about fake news what an amazing story to appear in the CBC of all places a news organization that is hardly pro-gun you see the CBC decided to check out the ongoing narrative about where guns are being sourced from when it comes to criminal acts being committed in Canada especially since we've been led to believe that half of those guns are illegally smuggled from the United States whereas the other half are illegal guns that have been trafficked by law-abiding gun owners to criminals a number that has always made me raise a spocky and eyebrow indeed check out this clip from last month in which we caught up with Mayor John Tory who recited the 50 50 step pertaining to gun sourcing during a conversation with a concerned resident on Danforth Avenue the scene of Toronto's latest mass shooting what can you say to that I can say to that that we're gonna try and get the guns off the streets trying where are the guns coming well 50% are coming from united states and 50% are being purchased legally here and then trafficked yeah how does that saying go again there are lies damned lies and statistics because the thing is when law enforcement and our elected officials referred to statistics usually there's a source for those stats but that's the really amazing factor regarding the CBC report not only does the 50% stat not exist but it turns out there's no concrete info regarding gun crime stats to begin with either for example reporter Evan Dwyer notes that RCMP inspector Chris mcbrian told The Vancouver Sun two years ago the following quote it is a fact that the majority of gun related crimes in our communities are committed with guns that are domestically sourced end quote now you'd think this would be a solid statistic given that inspector mcbrian was speaking as head of the Western Canada division of the National weapons enforcement support team of the Canadian firearms program meaning that if anyone should know the nitty-gritty pertaining to guns it would surely be Brian but when the CBC contacted the Canadian firearms program men asked to look at the data behind his categorical statement the RCMP replied that well no such data exists here's what the RCMP said in a statement quote inspector McBrine statement would have been based on information available to him at that time however this information would not have provided a complete national picture of the sources of crime guns as no such data exists end quote oh but it gets worse because RCMP sergeant Murray domain further adds quote currently there is no national repository for this type of information in Canada the Canadian firearms program does not collect or track national statistics with regard to the origin of crime guns end quote and yet the outright lined pertaining to guns continues even at the very top level for example Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told the guns and gangs summit in Ottawa earlier this year that an increasing number of guns used in crimes in Canada were coming from within the country here's what he tweeted quote with so many crime guns coming from legitimate domestic sources we need effective firearm measures end quote but much like inspector McBryan where is Minister Goodell getting his data seems to me that both these individuals are pulling numbers from a certain orifice where the Sun don't shine in fact it's really hard to form any kind of picture regarding gun crime stats regarding how flawed the statistical gathering process is for example the CPC report notes that the definition of a crime gun is that a gun was used in the commission of a crime so you would likely assume from that statement that a firearm related violent crime is a crime in which a gun has been used or at least brandished right but no that's not the case at all a stat scan report entitled firearms and violent crime in Canada twenty sixteen notes at for an offense to be considered firearm related a firearm need only be present during the commission of the offense not necessarily used in other words folks as Dyer notes suppose there was an altercation between two individuals in a home that leads to a fistfight the police are called and after arresting the guilty parties they notice a gun cabinet and they remove a legally owned rifle from the home that fistfight will will be recorded as a firearm related violent crime even though the legal firearm was never removed from its law case in fact the CBC report note said of 1140 so-called crime guns seized in BC Alberta Saskatchewan Manitoba Northwest Territories and the Yukon in 2016 alone only 150 guns were actually recovered following specific violent offenses including disturbance and uttering threats bottom line we conformed to conclusions based on this report first the collection of gun crime stats in Canada is horrendously flawed so flawed in fact that the data is worse than useless secondly it is downright egregious that law enforcement and elected officials continue to parrot that 50% of the guns used in gun crime are legally registered firearms that have been trafficked so what pray tell is the real reason for this ongoing litany of lies is it to vilify law-abiding citizens who are legal gun owners so that even more draconian gun control laws can be implemented laws that will do absolutely nothing to make the streets of Canada safer because that's what it sure looks like to me for the rebel media I'm David the mens Lloyd Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go
