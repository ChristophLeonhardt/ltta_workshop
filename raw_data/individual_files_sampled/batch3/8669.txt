MEADOWS FIRED BACK THAT ROSENSTEIN SHOULD STICK TO FACTS AND NOT RHETORIC. ALL RIGHT. WE ARE JOINED NOW BY A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE, FREEDOM CAUCUS. THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM FLORIDA. GOOD EVENING. OKAY. SO YOU PROBABLY HEARD A LITTLE BIT FROM THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL RESPONDING TO THIS. I WANT TO PLAY MORE OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TODAY WHEN THIS TOPIC CAME UP. DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MAKING THREATS PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY AGAINST ME FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND I THINK THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS NOT GOING TO BE EXTORTED. WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT'S REQUIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE EXTORTED THE DOJ. WELL, EARLIER YOU PLAYED A CLIP WHERE ROSENSTEIN SAID NO HOUSE REPUBLICANS WOULD PUT NARROW THEIR NAMES OF THESE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. ROSENSTEIN HIMSELF SIGNED THE DOCUMENT TO SPY ON AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WITH NO JUSTIFICATION. HE ALSO PUT HIS NAME ON THE PLEADING TO SILENCE THE WHISTLEBLOWER IN THE URANIUM ONE CASE. THE DEFINITION OF EXTORTION IS FORCING SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DO UNDER SOME THREAT. ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS AN OBLIGATION TO FOLLOW THE LAW. THAT'S ALL WE WANT HIM TO DO. AND WHAT'S MOST TELLING ABOUT HIS VIEWPOINT OR HIS MOST RECENT COMMENTS TO THE NEW YORK TIMES WHERE HE SAID HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT THE CONGRESS HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT. AND THEN OF COURSE ENSURE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. HERE THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DEPARTEDED FROM THE LAW. THEY DID SO BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT TO GET DONALD TRUMP. LET'S TALK ABOUT CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S PROGRESS ON SOME OF THESE FRONTS AS FAR AS COOPERATION WITH THE DOJ. WHY IS THAT NOT ENOUGH? WE'RE NOT GETTING THE DOCUMENTS FAST ENOUGH. WE'VE REQUESTED 1.3 DOCUMENTS AND WE'VE RECEIVED ONLY A FEW THOUSAND AT A TIME. THAT'S ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE. NOW ROSENSTEIN HAS SHOWN HIS CARDS. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL ABILITY TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FBI KNOW THEY DID WRONG IN THESE FISA WARRANTS THAT WERE BASED ON FALSE INFORMATION WHERE THEY WERE NOT DISCLOSING THE FACTS TO THE COURT. THEY'RE HOPING IF THIS TAKES LONG ENOUGH AND THIS SURVIVES TO THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS, THERE'S A CHANCE DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE CONTROL AND THERE WILL JUST BE A WITCH HUNT OF THE PRESIDENT. TIME IS NOT OUR FRIEND. QUICKLY ON THIS IDEA OF THE FALL ELECTIONS, WHICH YOU MENTIONED JENNIFER RUBEN SAYS THIS, THESE PEOPLE, MEANING YOU GUYS, TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT ARE NUTS AND UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE. ENOUGH. VOTE THEM OUT. HOW DOES THIS FACTOR IN? WELL, SHE HAS ONE VOTE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. THE FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FED UP WITH THE MISTREATMENT OF OUR PRESIDENT. WE'VE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO'S OUT THERE TRYING TO DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN PENINSULA. AND HE HAS TO DEAL WITH THIS. IF THERE EVEN WAS A PROSECUTION, ROSENSTEIN WOULD BE A WITNESS BASED ON THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RELEASED ABOUT COMEY'S FIRING. SO YOU CAN'T OVERSEE AN INVESTIGATION WHEN YOU COULD POTENTIALLY BE A WITNESS IN THAT INVESTIGATION. THESE AREN'T THINGS THAT ARE NUTS. WE JUST WANT THE LAW TO BE FOLLOWED. KEEP US UP TO DATE. WE KNOW THAT WE'LL BE WATCHING
