so today the u.s. opened its embassy in Jerusalem moved it from Tel Aviv and they say that you know they're recognizing a Jerusalem as the rightful capital of Israel that of course was supposed to be negotiated at the final stages of the peace deal that has not been we've done it unilaterally it has led to great anger and protests and to unfortunately a lot of deaths at the border so who are we going to choose the United States to do the ceremony there and to do the prayer at the opening of our embassy well you would imagine someone who's not going to be volatile right you don't want to further antagonize Muslims or Jews but why would you do that I mean that's crazy right we're supposed to be celebrating the capital of Israel hold or Christian's etc but of course we did not go in that direction the Trump administration chose the primary pastor is Robert Jeffress pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas so well some people are upset about this including a very prominent Republican Mitt Romney who of course was the presidential candidate for the Republicans in 2012 and he is now the candidate for the Senate seat in Utah and he put out this sweet he said Robert Jeffress says quote you can't be saved by being a Jew curious guy to send in Israel and Mormonism is a heresy from quote the pit of hell he said the same about Islam such a religious biggest should not be given the prayer that opens the United States Embassy in Jerusalem but yet he has it's almost as if the bigotry is not the bug but the feature so let's dive in a little bit more upon that I find out a little bit more about pastor Jeffress and what kind of a monster he is so what is aggrieved Mitt Romney to be fair to Romney he he is called a bigger tree many times about other groups as well but particularly to his own group Jeffers said that Mormonism is quote a cult and that voting for Romney for president would quote give credibility to a cult so people in Utah you vote for that party you ought to have your head examined anyway then he said this generally about all the other religions Jeffers says God sends good people to hell well what a nice God he must be he continues not only do religions like Mormonism Islam Judaism Hinduism not only they lead people away from God they lead people to an eternity of separation from God in hell they sent a pastor to open the embassy in Israel who thinks that all the Jews are going to hell and are going to be tortured for eternity let alone what he thinks of Muslims okay now speak here which what does he think of Muslims you know they're very good look he's a thousand terrible things they'll just give you one of the examples he says that Islam promotes pedophilia ironic coming from a man in the Christian Church okay we'll get to his buddy in a second because there was a second pastor you're gonna like what he had to say too in other words you're not gonna like it it's going to be horrific that guy quotes Hitler so hold on we'll get to him but back to Jeffress how about other Christians can we at least get on the same page there okay the Jews the Hindus the Muslims they're terrible the Mormons but other Christians even if you don't consider Mormonism part of Christianity nope Jeffers cannot concede that either about Catholicism he says it is a cult-like pagan religion is anything not cult-like okay all right but here's one thing where he says oh no Jesus gonna suck us up like a vacuum cleaner into the sky that's not a cult that's definitely gonna happen two other guys are cults okay he continues if you want a counterfeit dollar bill you don't do it with purple paper and red ink you're not gonna fool anybody with that but if you want to counterfeit money what you do is make it look closely related to the real thing as possible referring to of course Catholicism and that's what Satan does with counterfeit religion he uses he steals he appropriates all the symbols of true biblical Christianity and he changed it just enough in order to cause people to miss eternal life I didn't know Satan was running the Catholic Church look I know that Sony's insane people believe that everybody else is going to hell on every other religion is gonna leech oh man you were so close to heaven with the whole Jesus and the Trinity and the Holy Ghost you were so close except you didn't do the shaking and speaking in tongues and other insanity that Jefferson is idiot idiot fellow pastors encourage here in America or you didn't handle snakes oh you were so close but you missed it you missed it so torture forever okay he continues after all the Catholic Church talks about God in the Bible in Jesus and the blood of Christ and salvation isn't that it's a genius of Satan so this is the guy Donald Trump sent to open the embassy in Jerusalem a guy who hates all the other religions and think that they are the work of Satan must be so proud now you're thinking well how about the other pastor I mean you can't top that can you Reverend John Hagee says hold my beer he is the founder of Christians United for Israel an ironic title he also delivered remarks at the ceremony he came under fire in 2008 when audio resurfaced of him seeming to say Adolf Hitler was a hunter who was called upon to help Jews return to Israel he helped the Jews by murdering six million of them that's the two pastors that they said to Israel you think they're in favor of Israel using they're in favor of the Jews they can't stand them this is all part of their stupid mythology and where the end times happens in the vacuum cleaner and then you know what happens all the Jews are murdered by Jesus that's Jefferson's plan that's Hagee's plan that's the evangelical evangelical Christian fundamentalist insanity that unfortunately 25% of America believes him just know what you're getting it's a dark dark philosophy and and and to insult everyone in the region by sending these guys only Donald Trump could do that and and the evangelicals who voted for him cheer enthusiastically yes near where everyone but us dies that's the kind of people they are two easy ways to follow young turks want us hit the subscribe button down
