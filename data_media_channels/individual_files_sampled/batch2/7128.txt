so sean hannity yesterday we found out is a third client of michael cohen and a lot of people talked about it on air that makes sense then hannity came on his show he teased it of course all the way through the so annoying what they do on television and at the end he briefly talked about it but mainly he wanted to distract people and talk about someone else well this is really great because one of our viewers sent us in he made it and we're gonna air it now by the way if you want to send us stuff that you've done send it at rebel HQ at TYT Network comm rebel HQ at TYT Network comm and we might air it as well but Kevin Williams set this in great work so here's about a one-minute synopsis of Sean Hannity show from yesterday the media went absolutely insane fired up bi director james comey home it James Comey James Comey James Comey call me call me call me call me James call me call me call me call me call me homie commis him call me call me call me call me call me James Comey urinating on a bed homeys Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton Jim Comey Hillary Clinton call me call me call me Ames call me Hillary Clinton mr.

totally malign and if possible impeach the President of the United States and what people are not understanding here is when the special counsel raids the offices of the president's private attorney Muller is now basically back toward his way into every single Trump business deal at least since Michael Cohen has worked with Donald Trump they take all this information including everything including the material that is ultimately found to be confidential and lawyer-client despite all of today's major breaking news the fake news was totally obsessed with all Michael Coleman rated the president's personal attorneys home and his office and his hotel room Russia collusion has now become stormy Daniels payment by his own lawyer the president is exactly right this is a huge massive double standard you think Hillary Clinton's attorneys had their offices raided you think Hillary Clinton's lawyers were they raided after it was determined she bought and paid for that pony Russian dossier any raids any arrests after the massive FISA abuse allegations were exposed were there any raids any arrests after Hillary Clinton we know she obstructed justice it should be in the minds of every American citizen tonight this should alarm every person watching this broadcast tonight I wish would raid the DOJ and the FBI and grab their computers so my favorite part was in the middle one he said this is backdoored his way the prosecutors did into everything Cohen has I wonder if that would be relevant to you Sean I wonder if you should have disclosed that to your audience in all those clips were you railed against prosecutors for raiding Michael Cohen's office at home did you ever mention that the documents they'd be getting were yours oh you never mentioned that did you Sean well that is awfully convenient and that was a massive conflict of interest but are we really surprised that a Fox News host would hide the truth and not reveal to his audience what's really going on but I'm gonna give Alex shows the last word here if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey T network.com slash join get the whole younger so every day
