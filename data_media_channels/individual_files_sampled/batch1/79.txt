400,000 children in the Democratic Republic of Congo could die of hunger UNICEF says the international community must take action now but the country is peppered with armed conflicts and that means a substantial aid effort is difficult so what can be done to save these children this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Peter Dhabi armed conflicts continue to have devastating consequences for the children of Cass I and the Democratic Republic of Congo UNICEF says around 400,000 children are facing the imminent threat of death from starvation and that number will quote skyrockets if urgent actions not taken to boost the humanitarian response the agency wants eighty eight million dollars to fund its programs there now in December the UN declared the crisis at the highest level that's the same as Yemen Syria and Iraq the Kasai region descended into violence in 2016 over a power dispute between a local chief and government authorities has also been fighting between anti-government groups and forces loyal to the president Joseph Kabila who failed to step down in 2016 when his last term in office officially came to an end let's have a quick look at what the report also found more than two million children are in need of humanitarian assistance at least four hundred and forty thousand children were unable to finish their school year last year five hundred schools were attacked used for military purposes or destroyed 60% of the region's militia are children with thousands recruited into the armed groups more than 200 health centers were looted burnt or destroyed we have now children coming back from the bush after months of violence he's in a very bad nutritional situation we think that seven hundred seventy thousand children suffer from acute malnutrition including four hundred thousand children who suffer from severe acute malnutrition a child suffering from severe acute malnutrition is a child who might die at any times very very fragile these are not new numbers but it's extremely serious to see that the phones are not here okay let's get going let's bring in our guest joining us from London Okita Tong Gamow president of the Congolese support group in the UK out of Goma we're going to be joined by Fidel baffi lembeh an independent consultant on the Democratic Republic of Congo's Affairs also in London Alex vines head of the Africa program at Chatham House welcome to you all Akito coming to you first why is this happening your country thank you very much Pizza situation is well-known is due to the weakness of the regime speaking now the Congolese people's are abundant to themselves nobody is there to look after them the current regime is a quarry successively very weak it's not helping anyone and the people's are in a dangerous situation it's been there for money 20 years we see people being in in that situation the situation is going to carry on because of the weakness of the regime Alex vines in London 1 million people have been forced from their homes just give us a sense of where they've gone and is that situation sustainable well the majority have been internally displaced inside parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo and there's a displacement figure of over 4 million people have been moving around this is one of the big tragedies globally not just about the Democratic Republic of Congo and it's there are a number of different conflicts that have been taking place in the Kassie regions and in the kickee vu regions in particular it's it is cyclical unfortunately and it does tie up to the previous speaker one of the reasons for this is that the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a weak government which has actually prospered from weakness and insecurity these these conflicts actually feed in to a to a logic of maintaining the current president in in power Joseph Kabila jr. and he has used crisis several times to postpone elections and to justify his continued incumbency the basic point to all of this is that this is a human crisis this is not from a natural disaster and there is a political solution to this Fidel baffle mber in Goma the UNICEF is asking for 88 million dollars is that actually enough well nothing will ever be enough to meet there the humanitarian needs in this country which has been destroyed for decades now but any job within our dispersion of needs I think it's a it's a step forward and it's knit Akito togarmah in London the government actually boycott is one of the more recent aid donor conferences on the face of it that would seem quite illogical why do you think they chose to go down that road there's actually a good question Peter Rita appreciate especially to hear all the comment from all my colleagues is really situation in the Congo is manually due to the weakness of the government in addition of today's we have to add on that because whenever we see a credible regime we see more than four million people just going back to what Alex as I said this is a humanitarian crazies it's not acceptable in our planet to see such thing happening nowadays and the regime is refusing assistance just because they want clapping the power illegally which they already do in our moment so my understanding is the situation is josue ban is being turned but it's the regime in a way that they try to minimize what in what is the actual gravity of what is happening to people's life and the only way we can understand what the government is doing now is by saying that there is an illegal government is illegitimate government and the corner test press themselves freely to convince people while they are there the only way they could not try to hide whatever they're doing but let me I don't know one apart from talking about 4 million people where we see being forced to replace the house we got lot of things that happen in the past we got a mass grave which is still today in Congo we go abduction of human right and the people going to Congo try to assist the people in a difficult situation more recently we go history will happen in even longer Parker to British people being kidnapped why the lady who was there working as a goddess was killed in the presence we got a history of a dramatic situation in the Congo a moment oh this is the comet ignoring to accept to devalue the Constitution Alex Mainz in London 60% of the various militia groups are made up of children I mean that's according to the United Nations is not according to us here al Jazeera but there has been a lessening of the level of violence the level of the conflict within that lesson is there anything that can be built on is there any positive in there at all well yes the lessening of the crisis at the moment the conflict specially in the casa regions is really important because it opens up an opportunity for humanitarian access and the figures that and reports coming out is that access is improving and so international development partners international NGOs can go start going in and providing assistance both to children and displaced and also there is returnees taking place so we've talked about that 4.3 million displacement there are now people returning but to make this sustainable we do need a political solution to the Congo as I've said this is cyclical I mean credit to you at al Jazeera that you over the the last decade have been consistently reporting on the DRC Congo but many other media outlets only will draw attention to it when there is an announcement like UNICEF of a major humanitarian crisis the solution is to have a credible election and move politics forward there have been planned elections postponed several times now since 2016 and we still got to see whether there's going to be an election in Congo in December this year the president of the Congo is a very is not a strong man he's a weak president compared with some of his neighbors but he has been very wily and able to constantly postpone elections and so the humanitarian response needs to be coupled with a political one Fidel befel ember in Goma in this area we're talking about the government has managed to regain control but not convincingly enough to take that lessened level of violence that lowered level of violence to no violence at all why is that well I think the lessening of wellness can be can be debated because there has been pockets are or violence are almost everywhere yes maybe it's lessening in Kasai but in the cables itself what are we hearing of the ADF gnilova what kidnapping killing butchering people in the de Luna Park that we saved next to the Virunga another entity called the beach or people are killing each other and so forth and very recently two days ago only we had a community I mean of food to Congolese who to Fleming petitioning of it or not hippopotamus which has been vain mentally rejected by others and which is likely to raise again more I mean to trigger more violence even our setting communities or ethnic groups again artists so I think as my predecessors have put it well this is in the line of Kabila killing in law I mean in in office himself because that's the only way he can keep safe all the plundering the pillaging he has been doing of a Congo assets but also to get I mean shelter in terms of prosecution so for that he's fearing that he could be caught with if he ever lives power Akita tongue over in London for you or the people you talk to does mister Kabila have any credibility at all when he refused to step down in 2016 excellent very good question again Peter I just saw LOD on more Fink's and question again let me mention this clearly I don't see anyone in a planet that will see the value of the Constitution being put on hold like a villa is doing in a very fragile regime and infra jokes to institution and Congo we want to build a nation to have to have a stability in the region Congress got strong impact in our society and in our planet the issue of Congo need an emergency solution it completely a failing state as a result of mr. Camila breaching the Constitution and forcing himself to be President there's a need for an emergency assistance to Congolese people at the moment there's no one in the planet will observe what is happening in Congo Congo become an emergency situation and I do not want question adjust to make it clear to the international community which I believe is have a strong impact on the situation live or people have to be looking at this way we have to say an emergency solution an hour which is by proposal would be to use most serious serious tone from NATO nation obligation probably the best one would be the use of force to the boom mr. camilla by fools we have a series up in a different country there's nowhere we're gonna see someone because I totally against when there was a some rapport people believe that a kabila tried to get some part of the country camilla is totally the most weakest prison he lost complete of the country Congo is a lost country imam is the lost state there's nothing functional all the institutions are illegal who do you by mr. kabila forcing himself to be president we have to rebuild an accountable nation we have to see people I be protected all the result of the current situation is due to the weakness of mr. kabila is a refusal to accept the value of Constitution and a Magnus tablet every country we see the outcome people been killed four million being forced to the place from the house we see young people being abducted we see politician abducted we got a truck Rico in corruption we have su all scenario that emergency situation have to be up in now okay these people need assistance I just want to pause for a second gentlemen such when a recap on how we got to where we are today well the Democratic Republic of Congo or DRC it achieved independence from Belgium in 1960 since then the country suffered two civil wars and violent conflicts in 1997 rebels backed by Rwanda captured the capital Kinshasa and I stood the president Mobutu Sese Seko Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo laurent de xira kabila became the president a year later in what was known as the second Congo war rebels bank by Rwanda and Uganda rose up against kabila Zimbabwe Namibia and anger sent troops to repel them but the rebels took control of much of the east of DRC the six African countries involved in the war signed a ceasefire accord in Lusaka Zimbabwe in 1999 one year later the UN Security Council authorized a five and a half thousand strong force to monitor the ceasefire but the fighting continued in 2002 the Congolese government rebels and opposition parties signed a peace agreement in South Africa to end four years of civil war and set up a transitional government in 2006 Kabila's son Joseph was declared the winner of the country's first democratic elections in 2015 he extended his term in office prompting severe unrest Alex can I just come to you with my next point there is this a confection of people who are now feeling frustrated and resentful that the ordinary people of the country because they cannot see their desires being addressed at all but there have been massive demonstrations in Kinshasa the faith groups particularly the churches have been very strong also in their statements that they need to there needs to be elections and political change I think one of the mistakes we are making is assuming that mr. Kabila jr. is completely in control of his own destiny he isn't a strong man in the way that we might see in some of the neighboring states like Uganda where mr. Museveni or mr. Kagame of Rwanda so Kabila jr. also relies on support of an elite of other people inside Kinshasa and one of the problems I think is that that Pattillo call elite hasn't been helped to work out consensus on who they would wish to succeed mr. Kabila and hence that's part of the problem here too this is about an elite reaching a consensus and hence we have this drift but it's very serious now because we have a massive humanitarian crisis that is is man-made it's it's a human crisis and then Congo has other massive challenges it's a got weak institutions we've also just heard that there's been yet another outbreak of Ebola for example in the Democratic Republic of the Congo all of these indicate that we need a credible government in Kinshasa that is more developmentally focused and that just isn't there at the moment Fidel burfi lembeh in Goma to the Western countries just simply acquiesce in the face of mister Kabila and what he continually now it would appear want to do why does why do the West look the other way well I think it's mixed more sense when you see how the Western our investment in mining like in Colosseum in Catania which is the economic hobble are on a DRC its billions and billions in dollars that have been invested and though there has been a change or with you within the new mining code but I think the other table agreement that he has signed with these international companies Easy's guarantee to stay in power and they can sell us our stories I mean that will place we I mean the we obtain in the public opinion but actually we're not seeing a strong commitment from the West to do anything in any way I'm not blaming them because in the end at the end of the day it's gonna be a upon the Congolese people themselves to stand up for their faith and at the international community that said we have MONUSCO here I mean the UN peacekeeping force which is by its size the largest human his cape in mission on on this planet but it's been 17 years now those folks they had been on the ground but still nothing is changing so I equate the UN peacekeeping forces Chia the candle is only useless yeah okay total normal Alex in London there I think was referring to the deal historically the deal that was brokered by the Roman Catholic Church are there any bones of that deal that are salvageable that could be turned around and used in a positive since a sort of very complex in the way that the Catholic Church work extremely hard to to make some agreement of when there was a difficult situation on the ground but the only issue which I have to insist and I keep on repeating or now is it just the refusal to accept on any planet it was a put in place it to have a stability in Congo I do agree before all my colleague who mentioned a number of issue which relied to why the situation is chaotic and the more dangerous and that we expecting some credible assistance and emergency situation to be cooled now to help Congolese people we we talk in here for people's life bitter we got a history and a generation of a breach of Constitution and the law by mister Kabila sense in 2016 at the end of his term in office and the Catholic did given agreement which was a very simple for him to have any any year just to plan into organized election the reason behind that because it was a financial implication of to organize a credible election so we see the outcome of time mister Kabila is refusing to make anything work you know the moment in Congo and until now I totally disagree that elite in Congo don't have anyone to represent mister Kabila it's just the position I'm sorry the government and the regime they see themself a very weak and I don't have anyone who can't be elected by Congolese people at the moment have destroyed the whole country and they are now refusing to see the stability in the future of the country moving on so that's what the outcome we see now they're using force and opposing people kabila there and they kill anyone who tried to speak about the freedom and probably the respect or the value of the Constitution okay you are quoting for difference coming towards the end of the program Iquitos I just want to get to a last couple of few points with with our other guests Alex vines in London there are election scheduled for later this year in your heart of hearts do you think those elections will happen and if they do happen in the run-up to them happening will we see more or less violence so there are a number of countries that really do care of what's happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and goal is one of them and it has intervened in the past the pressure is growing it is growing very signal on that there should be elections because the view in Luanda is that we can't continue in Congo in the way that we're seeing at the moment is undermining stability so I do think that we are coming into an endgame process now what we're seeing at the moment is not sustainable long term and I don't believe that mr. kabila will remain in power for yet another two years with a delayed election so we are coming up to crunch point Fidel for you can an election lead to a solution in a country that I guess is defined by corruption defined by civil war and defined by a leader who's got enough leverage somehow to keep himself in place well it would be very bold saying that elections are gonna bring a stability or sustainable stability in this country however I think all people need is to have a chance to be given a chance where they can are they can fend for themselves they can start working they can start wobbling freely and so forth so set the fundament or the basis for our development that's what people need however there's still a lot of challenges in terms of Governors corruptions insecurity that needs to be cleared and that's not something that gonna be ended within five or so or ESD cap the key to tango MOU in London there was a lot of hope at one point pinned to the youth protest movement where if those voices now gone particularly in the run-up to probable elections at the end of this year okay I think they still there but do you know the use of force and intimidation especially brutal killing of them we still got one of them still not being buried Rossi mocking you who believed the family will bury him very soon because the regime killed him publicly we see the outcome of barbaric regime but no giving people the chance to express themselves we need to have a stable nation we need to have a very credible Congo this is a country that will give a hope for the rest of the planet we got a number of Rashidah to play there's a humanitarian crisis in Congo which is a permanent there has been a long history of a breach of law and the use of force about the regime and all this is out of what is happening now as an outcome of the situation all this movement is still there and let me mention that all the young people in the Congo they're expecting to see the change of regime we want to see an accountable regime Congress got a big role to play in our planet the only obstacle we have our moment is a mystical better energy regime to say Quito we're out to behind I'm very sorry I'm gonna have to interrupt you there and bring our conversation to a close gentlemen thank you so much for your time though thank you to our guests Akito tong gobo fidel baffle ember and
