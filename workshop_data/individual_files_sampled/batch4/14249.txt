many of these people had only gotten their news about about for donaci√≥n in the ford factor from i would say some disproportionate coverage and outlets like the Toronto Star and CBC so they were expecting a man to come in and maybe even quite literally push furniture around and and bloviate and you know sort of swear and so forth and people came up to me afterwards they said well you know he was a really reasonable guy and you had his views on public policy that that I really liked and actually people have told me that they started supporting and volunteering for his campaign based on that conversation and as her I think when we get to the truth of what Doug actually believes what he's said during the leadership campaign and what what he's gonna say on the campaign trail he is pretty much a centrist moderate guy and there was very little difference between the stuff him and Christine Ellie were saying now this may disappoint some people who actually want a bit more applecart flipping but quite frankly he's a moderate yeah and I think you allude to this in your column because people have this impression of what the Fords are like stylistically aesthetically is some of the personal controversies with Rob when they get to know Doug they'll say oh well that's I'm more comfortable with Doug that I thought I would be he is not the caricature that a Jimmy Kimmel or a radical CBC host would paint unto me I I think with a lot of politicians that we that we've known about for years I think Stephen Harper by the time he was running his fourth election or whatever was everybody had made up their mind about no one was gonna change what they thought about Stephen Harper it wasn't gonna change his identity but Doug Ford I think he still has a chance to introduce himself and I think it's gonna come across I think more reasonable than the than the crazed Ford haters and say the Toronto Star newspaper that has like made it their mission to destroy the Fords as in I think he actually has room to grow I think you're completely right as referred for just a number of angles one he has very moderate views I mean he's talking about finding efficiencies for several billion dollars which is really only two to four percent of the government the other things he's talking about axing the carbon tax that is something that when it's pulled appropriately a lot of people pull it in really bogus ways like do you care about the environment being decimated why not so obviously everybody says they do but when you actually ask you support a carbon tax most people absolutely do not so all these issues that Doug Ford supports he's really on the side of the people and I was actually speaking to him earlier this morning and he said he wants to get a movement going or already knows there's a movement out there right for the pickings that includes not just conservatives but disaffected liberals and appears in green supporters so rather than going on alienating people Doug Ford wants to say to everybody welcome come on in and you know I went to his campaign launch and I was also at the convention you look around the room and and the diversity that you see that Doug Ford is broad is is greater than you're gonna have at any liberal party event that I've been to that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
