Caregiving is something
that people go into
most likely because they have a family
member that needed caregiving.
But most likely caregiving happens because
they have compassion for the person
that went through that particular incident
to require caregiving.
It’s also something
that you do out of love.
In 2017, Hawaii passed the Kupuna Care Act.
Kupuna means elder in Hawaiian,
and the program will pay $70 a day
to family caregivers.
This payment helps offset caregiving 
expenses and supports hiring
part-time caregiving help.
The program is meant to help seniors who 
need some assistance
but wish to keep living at home.
The Kupuna program is very important for 
caregivers because you’re working
and you have to still take care of your 
elderly or your family member
while working full time or part time.
It’s very costly to caregive.
The medication, pamper supplies, the bed 
lining, the hygiene, it adds on.
If you have extra help just to give the
financial support to hire someone else,
so you can go to work the
next day and not be miserable.
That's a big help.
