IN THE CARAVAN, I WILL SEAL
OFF THE BORDER BEFORE THEY
COME INTO THIS COUNTRY.
AND I WILL BRING OUT OUR
MILITARY.
NOT OUR RESERVES.
I WILL BRING OUT OUR
MILITARY.
STEVE: THAT'S THE PRESIDENT
MAKING HIS MESSAGE CLEAR AS
THAT CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS
GROWS TO AN ESTIMATED 7200
AT THIS HOUR.
AINSLEY: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IS IT TIME FOR THE MILITARY
TO GET INVOLVED?
LET'S ASK OUR U.S. ARMY
VETERAN AND "FOX & FRIENDS"
CO-HOST PETE HEGSETH.
PETE: I SERVED OUR COUNTRY
NEVER AT THE BORDER.
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT
WILL BE TIME TO DEPLOY THE
MILITARY.
I BELIEVE.
SO WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR
IMMIGRATION POLICIES.
WE DON'T HAVE A WALL.
CATCH AND RELEASE STILL IN
EFFECT.
WE'RE NOT STOPPING THEM
BEFORE THEY COME TO THE
BORDER.
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO
REALLY DEAL WITH THIS -- AND
WE WERE TALKING TO FOLKS ON
THE BORDER ON THE WEEKEND
SHOW.
UTTERLY UNPREPARED FOR THIS.
DOING THE BEST WE CAN WITH
WHAT WE HAVE.
CROSSINGS ARE STILL UP AND
WITH THIS CARAVAN COMING
WE'RE NOT READY.
BRIAN: NOT READY BY LAW, IF
THEY CROSS, CERTAIN THINGS
THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO.
THEY ARE GOING TO GET THEIR
TIME IN FRONT OF A JUDGE.
GOING TO BE HELD ABOUT 20
DAYS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE
ARMY IS THERE SOMEHOW WE
HAVE TO GET ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE BORDER TO STOP
IT.
PETE: BECAUSE THE LAWS ARE
AS THE PRESIDENT CALLS THEM
DUMB.
THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE.
THEY DON'T PROTECT OUR
SOVEREIGNTY.
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO
BACK TO CONGRESS AND SAY
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE ACTUALLY
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT A WALL
IS PART OF SAYING YOU DON'T
GET TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY
UNLESS YOU PROVE THAT YOU
ARE A REFUGEE.
GO TO A PORT OF ENTRY.
CLAIM ASYLUM.
YOU WILL GET YOUR DAY IN
COURT.
WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER
IT'S VALID OR NOT.
YOU GOT THE PRESIDENT OF
GUATEMALA SAYING TO A LOCAL
NEWSPAPER DOWN THERE JUST
LAST WEEK THEY CAUGHT OVER
100 ISIS FIGHTERS IN
GUATEMALA TRYING TO USE THIS
CARAVAN.
TALKED TO THEIR LOCAL
NEWSPAPER.
WE DON'T KNOW IT T. HASN'T
BEEN VERIFIED.
EVEN ONE POISON PILL IS TOO
MANY IN A CARAVAN LIKE THAT.
STEVE: WHAT ABOUT THE FACT
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF
MENTION CO-SAID WE ARE GOING
TO STOP THEM AND PROCESS
THEM AND THEY CAN APPLY FOR
ASYLUM IN OUR COUNTRY AND
THEY HAVE HAD COPS IN RIOT
GEAR IN MEXICO STOPPING
PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME, YOU
KNOW, THEY JUST WALK AROUND
THEM.
PETE: THE CARAVAN KEEPS
COMING.
FROM YOU EVER TRIED TO MAKE
A RAFT?
YOU CAN'T.
THERE IS A CONCERTED EFFORT
TO HELP THESE PEOPLE AND
CARAVAN GROWN FROM 5,000 TO
7,000.
THEY WILL MAKE THEIR WAY TO
THE BORDER.
THESE COUNTRIES WANT THAT
POLITICAL STATEMENT AND SHOW
DOWN.
BRIAN: JOHN BOLTON IN MOSCOW
GOING TO BE SPEAKING WITH
LAVROV OVER THE FOREIGN
SECRETARY ABOUT GETTING OUT
OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL SIGNED
IN THE 1980s, THEY HAVE
BEEN VIOLATING IT.
DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOME
PLAY THERE IN THESE
NEGOTIATIONS OR IS IT JUST
AN ANNOUNCEMENT?
>> WE'LL SEE HOW IT UNFOLDS.
BUT I THINK TREATIES WERE
ONLY AS GOOD AS COMPLIANCE
AND CONTEXT.
AND IF THE RUSSIANS AREN'T
COMPLYING AND WE ARE, THEN
WE ARE LOSING.
THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE
SIGNED THAT TREATY WAS THE
COLD WAR.
U.S. AND THE USSR THE TWO
NUCLEAR SUPER POWERS.
SINCE THEN WHO HAS EMERGED?
CHINA.
CHINA NOW HAS TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY ARE THE SEEN AND WE
DON'T.
AINSLEY: ARE WE BEING TOUGH
ENOUGH IN THE CRITICS SAYING
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T BEEN
TOUGH ENOUGH ON RUSSIA.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
>> TOTAL OPPOSITE OF THE
REALITY ON GROUND.
