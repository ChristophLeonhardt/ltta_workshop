♪ ♪ Laura: WELCOME BACK. LET'S GET REACTION TO MY EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH RUDY GIULIANI FROM OUR OWN ALL-STAR PANEL. EARL, BRET BAIER IN NEW YORK TONIGHT. THE AUTHOR OF THE HUGE NEW SOON TO BE BEST SELLER "NEW YORK TIMES," 3 DAYS IN MOSCOW. RONALD REAGAN AND THE FALL OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE. AND FORMER WHITEWATER COUNSEL, SAL. SAL WHAT DID YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THAT INTERVIEW WITH RUDY? WELL, I LOOK AT EVERYTHING LIKE THIS AS AN INTERVIEW AS THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL AND THE SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL. AT THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL, HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB. THIS IS WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN HE WAS ON SEAN'S SHOW. HE WAS MORE POLISHED. HE KNEW MUCH MORE. THAT WAS VERY GOOD. MANY OF HIS STATEMENTS WERE INCORRECT. SOME OF THEM WERE PREPOSTEROUS AND SOME WERE JUST ARGUMENTS AND OPINIONS. THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE PERSON UNDER INVESTIGATION OR HIS ATTORNEY GETS TO SAY IT'S BEEN A YEAR, THAT'S TOO MUCH. IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, I THOUGHT HE DID PRETTY WELL. Laura: LET'S PLAY THE FIRST SOUND BITE FROM THIS INTERVIEW, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF CAN BE INDICTED. LET'S WATCH. THE SAME REASON THEY CAN'T INDICT HIM, THEY CAN'T ISSUE A SUBPOENA TO HIM. REMEMBER CLINTON OPPOSED A SUSPECT AND THEN HE COMPLIED. HE DID NOT GIVE UP HIS PRESIDENTIAL PERROGATIVE. HIS ADMINISTRATION WROTE A MEMO SAYING HE COULD COULD NOT DO THAT. BRET, I WANT TO GO TO YOU. A JUDGE SAID WHEN MUELLER'S TEAM WE WON'T INDICT THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE WILL STANDBY THIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ADVISORY OPINION THAT YOU CAN'T INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT. NAPOLITANO SAID THIS WAS A 1999 OPINION. IT WAS NOT BINDING. IF MUELLER WANTED TO CHANGE HIS APPROACH ON THAT, HE COULD. WHICH I FOUND INTERESTING. THAT WAS A FASCINATING PART OF THE INTERVIEW. RUDY IS HANGING ON TO THAT, THAT THE TEAM TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT THE INDICTMENT AND STAYING TO THE GUIDELINES FROM BACK IN THE CLINTON YEARS. HIS ANSWER SUGGESTED THEY ARE GETTING READY FOR A FIGHT. WHETHER IT'S LEGITIMATE AND HOW THEY COULD FIGHT IT IF THEY DON'T WANT THE PRESIDENT TO SIT DOWN WITH THE GUIDELINES THEY SET UP. Laura: SAL, YOU HEARD HIM AT THE END. LET THEM PUT ON THE TABLE WHAT THEY HAVE. WE DON'T THINK THE GROUND ARE LEGITIMATE AND WE WILL TAKE THEM TO COURT ON THESE ISSUES. HE SAID WE WILL RIP IT APART AND RIP THEM APART. ONE UP'SMANSHIP ON THE THREAT. WHAT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE POINT ON THE SUBPOENA? OH, HE IS COMPLETELY WRONG. THE FIRST SUBPOENA ISSUED AND SERVED ON A PRESIDENT WAS BY JOHN MARSHAL ON THOMAS JEFFERSON IN 1807. A SUBPOENA WAS SERVED ON MADISON AND WE KNOW ABOUT THE SUBPOENA SERVED ON PRESIDENT NIXON AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED THE PRESIDENT HAD TO OBEY IT. HE IS WRONG. THE OPINION ONLY TALKS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN INDICT A PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT CLINTON DID NOT FIGHT THE SUBPOENA FROM JUDGE STARR. HE ASKED US TO WITHDRAW IT AND SAID HE WOULD COME IF WE DID. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WOULD HAVE FOUGHT IT. I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE FOUGHT IT. IF HE IS SUBPOENAED AND INVOKES EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE COURT RULES AGAINST HIM, HE CAN SAY LIKE ANDREW JACKSON SAID, YOU MADE YOUR LAW, NOW SEE IF YOU CAN ENFORCE IT. THE SUPREME COURT SAID TWICE THESE ORDER VISIT TO BE OBEYED. HE COULD SAY I AM THE PRESIDENT AND I WON'T DO IT. THEN WE WOULD HAVE A CONSITUTIONAL CRISIS ON OUR HANDS. Laura: BRET, I BROUGHT UP THE ISSUES OF STAFFERS. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL BROUGHT IN A NUMBER OF THE FORMER STAFF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WATCH. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT ANY OF THE FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS? HOPE HICKS' NAME WAS THROWN AROUND WORKING WITH DON JR. ON THE STATEMENT ABOUT THE TRUMP POWER MEETING. ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL? GOD THAT WOULD BE REALLY CHEAP. IF THEY DID THAT TO HER, A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO STEP IN AND ACT. IT WOULD BE TOTAL INJUSTICE. Laura: BRET? BUT LISTEN, YOU HAVE JIM COMEY WHO TOLD ME HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT MICHAEL FLYNN WAS. LAWMAKERS SAYING HE TOLD THEM THAT THE FBI AGENTS DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT FLYNN WAS LYING BUT THE SCREWS WERE PUT ON FLYNN AND HE PLED GUILTY. HE MOVED FORWARD. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SCREWS BEING PUT TO A LOT OF OTHER STAFFERS WHO HAVE DONE INTERVIEWS. I THINK THE POLITICS OF THIS IS INTERESTING. I CAN SEE THE COMFORT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS IN RUDY GIULIANI BEING A FIGHTER FOR HIM. THEY MAY HAVE MORE AMMO SOON AS THIS IG-REPORT IS EXPECTED TO COME OUT SOON. MICHAEL HOROWITZ MAY HAVE DETAILS WE HAVE YET TO REVEAL. Laura: BRET, ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC. PRESIDENT REAGAN FOR WHOM I WORKED. GOES OVER TO MOSCOW IN 1988 AND GAVE A SPEECH AT MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY. THIS THING ABOUT KOREA AND WHETHER THE SUMMIT WILL HAPPEN. I WONDER IF THERE WILL BE A DAY WHEN WE COULD HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP GO TO NORTH KOREA OR A UNIFIED KOREA AND SPEAK TO A MIXED GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH. THINK ABOUT HOW WILD THAT WOULD BE. NOBODY PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR REAGAN TO GO TO MOSCOW. DEFINITELY NOT. THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT ANTI-COMMUNIST FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS. EVEN BACK WHEN HE WAS THE SCREEN ACTOR'S GUILD PRESIDENT AND THEN DELIVERED A SPEECH IN THE HEART OF COMMUNISM IN MOSCOW. IT'S POSSIBLE. IT'S TOUCH-AND-GO WITH THE JUNE 12th SINGAPORE SUMMIT BECAUSE
