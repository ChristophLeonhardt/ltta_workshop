on Monday we told you about a series of violent attacks over the weekend committed against journalists now if you believe the CNN or CBC they'll tell you that Donald Trump has whipped up people against the liberal press and it's a disgrace what Trump is done no not now I have not yet heard of a conservative ever attacking a journalist but I see every week leftists attacking conservative journalists our own company has been victimized that way including our own Sheila gun Reid who was punched in the face at a women's much well on this weekend in Toronto it was the Toronto Sun that was targeted and not even a writer or an opinion columnist but rather a long-serving photographer for the Toronto Sun named Stan B Hall here take a look at when he was just doing his job photographing some alt left anti foot types in Toronto flanked by seven police and he just got punched grabbed twice there is that stand in the blue and look at all those policemen just standing there idly joining us now in studio is a woman who you may have seen in the bottom right of the screen there so we're standing here for your way my friend Sue Ann levy Sue Ann great to see you again hi there were so many police there yes Stanley she's in dozens yeah and and just feet away there were seven I counted them what was it what was it like what happened they're actually the first time in my thirty year career Ezra that I actually felt intimidated I felt scared and you know I've been through a lot and I am not afraid to throw myself into things but not only did they attack Stan but this group that whipped themselves into a frenzy screamed all kinds of stuff about the son that I was racist they had recognized me about a half an hour into my race what are they talking wait so they got themselves all whipped up so this was ideological this wasn't just some opportunistic stupidity this was now argued no no no no no about a half an hour in and Stan and I are going around together we'd lose each other at some points we were together and they reckon up one guy recognized me and he started screaming and what they do is when they recognize you they shout out they do a shout out all their others and the rest of the Wolfpack comes yes and then I was stalked I was followed by three lefty lesbians who started screaming that I was disgraced to the LGBT community and I was intimidated and stalked by a cameraman who was filming for them no no Stan I don't know Stan why I know his name he's just a time I'm not saying just a photographer but he's not he's not writing he shoots interesting things and this was an interesting thing why did they why did they target him I you know I don't know there was somebody else at the rally who was a shooting for freelance for the wires and she also was surrounded and intimidated and I wrote about it in my piece on Sunday now did the police intervene in any way did they simmer down no no no why can you explain that well I was told that they had been asked from higher-ups we don't know who to stand down not to intervene because it might escalate the violence but frankly standing there and feeling totally unprotected totally unprotected I would say that all they did was enable and embolden well and many people and they proved but let's watch it in slow motion here because you know Stan I mean he's he looks like he's in his 50s and they they grab him grab it on twice he's holding his expensive camera gear somebody's not gonna so they grab its arms and look at that he's a young guy probably this 20 grab Stan's arm grab Stan's arm wrestles them around wrangles them and then just grabs his hat looks like it's pulling his hair also like that's a real grab it and runs away that's not just like a goofy little snatch a hat and run juvenile stunt that's a double grab immobilize see I'm sure one more time I think that's so reach for the Hat he blocks it so the youngster grabs the arm grabs the arm it mobilizes the arm reaches over the other hand grabs the head so much look at Stan's face look at this face there it's obviously grimacing is he grabbing the hair is he grabbing the skin he grab the hair the other arm is immobilized and he grabs it and look at all the cops just the right in with a smile yeah just smiling oh that's less a little bit of fun not doing a thing now we have a still image of the hat grabber arm grabber assaulted let's put that up here for a second that's him smile why wouldn't he smile and to the right of him is a longtime Marxist very wise letter who shows up at all these rallies and and provokes the people whips up these young people so he also was there and he of course we've heard nothing from him he should turn this guy in but no as he won't yeah well and we would encourage any of our viewers if they recognize this fella or recognize them from social media to to bring the information to the police would be the right people what's interesting is this was right there at Nathan Phillips Square this is right in the heart of the democratic process in Toronto supposedly and obviously if you are on as you well know if you are on the right and conservative and don't actually echo their view of the world then I mean I would be concerned that people are starting to be targeted in the media well I mean on our side of the media I mean I've never heard in history a CBC reporter being attacked in any way now because they're allies but they don't left no and you know the media most of the media all but a few media were silent have been silent well we're since I want to show you now there's an obscure blog called Canada land and and its leaders Jessie brownies thousands of a media critic I want to show you what he wrote about this so so we've shown about four times now Stan raised his arm the the alt left guy grabbed it pushed it down held it with one hand and and then grabbed Stan grimaces so that it was an assault I mean just speaking as a stand by the way is 6363 yes not in his fifth yes we've been doing it a long time and he was slight he's slight he's guy so let's say let me show you what Jesse Brown quote media critic of Canada lad said the appetite for crazy violent lefty stories is indeed it was the Hat snatch heard across the nation well that was a crazy violent lefty we've seen crazy violent lefties everywhere and you can see Jesse Brown who if this was it when he goes and that's when there's a mean word on Twitter Jesse brown but an actual violent assault that ended with the Hat snatch but that started with several grabs and I don't know if we call it a punch he just diminishes it to call the hat snatch one more tweet from Jesse Brown what about Stan's hat no we don't care about Stan's hat although that is theft we care about the fact that Stan a 63 year old photographer in a public space surrounded by police was grabbed and held at bay and hair was in grab that was an assault and the police did nothing and the so-called media critic cured it yes and I dare say that many members of the media party as you call them we're probably secretly giving it their tacit approval there ago the right you know the right the conservative people who aren't part of the past yeah absolutely and I see this sort of the harmonization on the hard left jesse brown and his obscure left-wing show called canada land there's a NDP backed website called press progress they're really trying to whip up violence against the Toronto Sun they are they are and we see that there's a conservative campaign like they're really naming names and trying to whip up hate against huge or Warmington who else anthony fury up to a certain degree lori goldstein but mostly anthony fury Joffe joe Warmington and myself and they also mention canada's malcolm i know they they hate conservative women the fact that you're also jewish and lesbian they think well in three ways you're supposed to be liberal because you're jewish because you're a woman because they hate you more than they hate a conservative man because they regard you as a as a betrayer and they even said that they even said that he said he's two other left-wing lesbians said you're a betrayer of the of the sexuality yourself yes well I have to say I'm disappointed in the Toronto Police but I'm sure the came from higher up I can't believe that any young man or woman joins a police academy to be a partisan you know approver of violence like that I can't believe that a real cop would feel good about that I can't either I think that they're they have been rendered in many ways impotent the police force I've written about this before we are huge champions of the police we always know you're the only newspaper in Toronto that is certainly did not deserve what happened you know what the Toronto Star hates the police cbc hates the police if they could get a black lives matter anti cop thing going in toronto they sort of do you want to talk about betrayal yeah that's a betrayal because we certainly didn't deserve it well I think of course the real blame lies with the perpetrator that young man who was violent against a 63 year old 63 year old photographer let me ask you this and I'm not asking you to give away any confidences or to put yourself in a difficult position but I remember when ro and Sheila Gunn Reid was punched in the face and we can show some imagery of this right now Sheila went to the women's March last year in Edmonton a women's March was punched in the face by a New Democrat activist and we sued we took him to criminal court we took him to civil court it was a statement then you can't do that to someone at the rebel with impunity has it and if I'm asking if I'm asking a questions too tough let me know as the son stood by you and stand be Hall is the son going to stand by its people it is it is and our lawyer has been contacted and we are you know sort of vigorously pursuing charges I am concerned about going to another rally like this because as I stated to my you know bosses this is now becoming more and more as you said we have to hire security yeah we will sensual out without security now well I'm looking at that as well yeah I'm looking at that frankly isn't it incredible and you know the rest of the media doesn't care or they're cheering for the violent ones they are you stay safe Sue Ann we need you we need you God knows my mom and dad are worried about me my Jewish mother yeah I believe it I believe it because you're supposed to be a journalist you're not supposed to be a you know a boxer yes unbelievable all right well you gotta we know this we know this the number of rebel personalities who have been attacked or rebel alumni and they go after the women I find yes you know of course Lauren southern was attacked when she worked with us at U of T everyone knows Sheila Gunn Reed was attacked in Edmonton one of our camera women was attacked I mean talk about cowardly and of course Gavin McInnes was attacked but we all enjoyed seeing that to be honest I'm just I'm joking around it of course it wasn't it wasn't permissible and Gavin wood no I'm just joking no it's it's impermissible but it seems to be permitted that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to
