This story is about one of my favorite songs

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,260
by one of the most beloved bands in the entire world.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,780
It begins on September 29, 2008 at a Radiohead show.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,940
Thom Yorke, Radiohead’s frontman, is at the piano,

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,200
and he's about to play a song called “Videotape.”

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,840

9

Thom Yorke, perhaps one of the most critically acclaimed musicians of his generation,

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,380

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,640
"This tune called 'Videotape'  that we’ve got

We kind of had an idea but we just couldn’t see it through."

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,180
The reason for all this is that this song draws its power

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,780
from a musical illusion.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,020

19

That's Warren Lain.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,640
He teaches his music students how to think

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,739

22

"For him to struggle with that, it shows
that he's actually hearing

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,500
something a lot more complex."

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,180
The mystery is so deep that Warren made a 30 minute video

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,100
trying to decipher it.

"Videotape" was officially released in 2007

41

And that DNA actually explains Thom’s messy start.

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,200
You see, the piano in "Videotape" is actually syncopated.
