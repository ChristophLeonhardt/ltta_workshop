now that Barack Obama's tenure as president is coming to an end the great man is beginning to wax philosophical for example in Wired magazine the president has written an article in which he says quote right now is the greatest time to be alive unquote and isn't that just so true right now is the greatest time to be alive because a person who isn't alive right now is dead and being dead is worse than being alive because worms eat you and you can't get HBO some people who aren't alive right now I've never even been born and that's a terrible thing because you have to hang around waiting for your parents to have sex which let's face it as disgusting even to contemplate then for nine months you're stuck inside your mother listening to her complain about how you're making her life miserable and you can't even get outside to show her just how miserable you can really make her when given half a chance Plus at any moment some psychopath from Planned Parenthood might start ripping you to pieces and selling your body parts whereupon the whole great time to be alive thing becomes sort of a moot point in another philosophical moment President Obama told an innovation conference that he wants to rein in what he called the wild wild west media all this freedom of information has gotten out of hand the president said and he cranked with a conspiracy theory you can run around telling people that I used the IRS to target conservative groups or corrupted the Justice Department for political purposes or was born in Kenya it's absurd I was born in Hawaii this madness has got to stop it's not just the president who's grown reflective the media are also taking time to discuss what a great great leader Obama has been in an article in The New York Times a former newspaper opinion editor blithering prevarication the third writes quote some people look around and see Obama care collapsing and the United States growing weaker and the world growing more dangerous and an over-regulated and overtaxed economy propped up by printed money and free credit in such a way that can only lead to a complete disaster but pessimists like that are only looking at reality they should read our paper instead none of those things is happening here and it's right here in these pages that Barack Obama is one of the greatest presidents who has ever lived The Times objective journalism editor the ring prevarication the third no relation agrees with the opinion editor who was a totally different person just with a similar sounding name mister third says quote this is a country steeped in racism so it was a great day when we elected a black president to tell us how steeped in racism we are soon we'll have a woman president - tell us how steeped in sexism we are and won't that be fun President Obama is so right this is a great time to be a liar or alive whatever unquote trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show I never get tired of watching the naked feminists turn into a housewife cup day should happen more often in real life all right tomorrow his mailbag day oh my gos it's a part of me tomorrow is now back day let's hear a whoohoo come on oh yeah bring back Lyndsey where's Lee all right so send in your questions right now if you're a subscriber if you're not a subscriber you can only sit there kind of looking longingly at the screen a wistful look in your face as the questions pile up in your mind until your entire life is just one long stream of confusion and irritation but if you are a subscriber you can not only watch the show and not get kicked off Facebook and YouTube after 15 minutes you can send in questions we will answer them all guaranteed or our answers are a hundred percent accurate and 99.5% guaranteed to change your life for the better all right so let me do that I've been working on this all day yesterday let me I'm now I don't do a lot of imitations a lot of impersonations I can do a few voices but not really personally here's my impersonation of the mainstream media covering the new evidence of corruption in the Clinton campaign thank you thank you very much I got it I think I just had it exactly right so Donald Trump is saying the election is rigged and people on the right are going crazy about this for reasons I will explain but first let's listen to Donald Trump you know let's let's get it clear he's saying this because the polls show him to be losing I think he is now 11 300 points behind everywhere like Sean Hannity his reading tea leaves and saying well in the battleground states you know he's very close do you think yeah cuz they're battleground states is everywhere else he's losing he's losing Utah yeah Utah were they they once saw a Democrat cope flying by through Salt Lake City all right so he's losing so now he's doing just what he did remember when he thought he was losing in the primaries he started saying the election is rigged and now he's saying it began here he is Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and gone to jail for what she instead of being held accountable Hillary is running for president in what looks like too many people a totally rigged election the election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect Hillary Clinton president but we are going to stop it we are not going to back down false stories all made-up lies lies no witnesses no nothing all big lies it's a rigged system okay so the the right is upset about this because they fear that it could end the Republican Party basically I mean if he loses especially if he loses in a close election which right now doesn't look like it's gonna happen but if even if he loses by a fair margin and he says this is all rigged then he marches off with his supporters leaving the GOP behind and this is what Republicans are worried about but they're also philosophical issues Brett Stevens who is a never Trump er he rates a brutal column this morning I mean a really brutal column comparing Donald Trump doing to Joseph McCarthy I don't know what it is about Donald Trump like people reach for these you know really go out there for the comparisons but listen listen to this opening of this Brett Stevens column they meet in secret men of immense wealth a woman of limitless of ambition their passports are American but their loyalties are not through their control of international banks in the media they manipulate public opinion and finance political deceit their aim is nothing less than the annihilation of America's political independence and they will stop at nothing including rigging a presidential election to achieve it call it for what it is quote a conspiracy on scale so immense as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man unquote astute readers will note the quotation of a speech delivered in the US Senate in June 1951 by the then junior senator from Wisconsin were in historically familiar territory Joe McCarthy and against communists in control of the State Department for Charles Lindbergh it was war agitators notably those of the Jewish race and now we have Donald Trump versus what Laura Ingraham calls the globalist cabal the latest enemy from without within in a speech Thursday in West Palm Beach the GOP presidential nominee painted a picture of a global power structure centered around Hillary Clinton that aims to quote plot the destruction of us sovereignty unquote while stepping on the necks of American workers with open borders and ruinous trade deals there is nothing the political establishment will not do mr. Trump thundered no lie they won't tell to hold their prestige and power at your expense and that's what's been happening so a really brutal takedown of Trump is Macar theist for caught for calling the election rigged and as I said he's doing this because he's losing this is what he always does but you know partly I think he's such an arson he's such a narcissist that the idea that he might be losing because he keeps stepping on his own foot you know she'd do well he first he shoots himself in the foot and then he steps on it you know steps on his foot and then he puts his foot in his mouth with the bullet still in it swallows the bullet and dies and then he blames everybody else but but you know this is this is really bothering people on the right and Jonah Goldberg also never Trumper he's arguing that Trump and Steve Bannon are there's all this information that they are preparing to start their own TV network and so what Goldberg says is that he's preparing the audience for this network here's Jonah Goldberg why is Trump constantly saying that if he loses it will be because the election was rigged why is he wasting precious time attacking fellow Republicans a move guaranteed to shrink his coalition even further because he wants the faithful to be permanently alienated from the rest of the political culture and utterly reliant on him in fairness it's also because he can't tolerate the idea that people will reasonably conclude that he's a loser and a choker so he has to lay the groundwork for the claim the other side cheated but that narcissistic insecurity just makes him all the more susceptible to Steve bannon's manipulation he was such abandoned puppet yesterday you could almost see Banias fingers moving in the back of trumps now okay so all of all of this I think the these are not insane criticisms I mean I think these are things you know Trump is a guy who doesn't have a lot of self-control doesn't have a lot of discipline has an ego that really is a problem I mean it really is a he has a diseased ego and but that there is this other question is he right you know is is the election in some sense rigged and here's George will and I put forward George will because George will is also a never Trump or who left the Republican Party because he just thinks the Trump doesn't represent anything that he believes George will is a long long time conservative and and he was asked by Brett Bayer on Fox yesterday is the election rigged and here's his response well when mr. Trump talks about it being rigged he sweeps all his grievances into one big puddle he talks about the media he talked about the primaries he talked about the polls talked about the Republican National Committee I think when most Americans hear that elections rigged they think of government action to rig the election and they're mr. Trump has a point if he would just make it more clearly it is hard to think of an innocent reason why Democrats spend so much time energy and money scarce resources all resisting attempts to purge the voter rolls that is to remove people who are dead or otherwise that left the jurisdiction it's hard to think of an innocent reason why they fight so tremendously against voter ID laws they say well let burdens the exercise of a fundamental right the Supreme Court has said that travel is a fundamental right and no one thinks that showing an ID at the airport burdens that fundamental right we know we don't surmise we know that the 2010 twelve and fourteen elections were rigged by the most intrusive and potentially punitive institution of the federal government the IRS and you know as he goes on as well goes on to point out any sites our friend Kim straw souls book the intimidation game you know this is still going on there was lots and lots of evidence that the IRS is still delaying giving nonprofit conservative groups their nonprofit status so they can get tax free donations and and this is happening also we mentioned yesterday I mentioned yesterday the dentist some of Dennis Prager videos I mean come on Dennis Prager let's Dennis Prager is one of the most reasonable conservative voices out there he's he tries to be an educator he tries to be educational he just tries to put forward first principles he talked about the 10 commandments and the relationship that I said before that they were restricting his videos on YouTube they've now started banning his videos on YouTube and it's it's just a little tiny teensy-weensy bit suspicious that this is happening right now why is it the conservative voices gets silenced why is Twitter banning project Veritas you know all these things are happening just as this election is taking place and why is it why is it that the left always wants silence you know why is it that we want more information out there because because ours what we're saying makes sense but the left just wants to shut the argument down so they cheat I mean this is the thing they cheat that's what we'll is saying that they cheat at a level that is has nothing to do with the way Republicans chief they don't do the same thing they why don't they want you to have to show an ID you know they make it a racist thing because they make everything a racer thing - come on come on we all have to show ID you have to show ID to do everything in this country you should have to show ID to vote so now we find out more information from from WikiLeaks and from also from an FBI release that the State Department was trying to deal with the FBI to stop them from classifying information emails that Hillary Clinton sent so that wouldn't look so bad so the State Department this is not Hillary Clinton the State Department is trying to collude with the FBI here's from the Wall Street Journal a State Department official in 2015 tried to keep the Federal Bureau of Investigation from marking a Hillary Clinton email is classified according to documents that reveal the extent to which officials sought to reduce the number of messages judged to contain national secrets the move by the State Department which came after questions were raised about mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State focused on a single email about the probe into the 2012 attacks on US outpost in Benghazi Libya and at one point there was discussion between you know should there be a quid pro quo can we get more permission will the State Department give permission for more FBI agents to go to Iraq and in return the FBI won't classify these easement emails I mean and look we already know that the White House coordinated was part of her defense we know that the White House our White House that we pay for the government that we pay for was defending her as a candidate which is not something we pay for there are emails that show top Obama administration officials in close contact with Hillary Clinton at it just as her campaign was beginning trying to prevent the fallout from these this revelation of the service so we know this government has been corrupted for political purposes I have to stop here to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube which I wouldn't have to do if you just subscribe just subscribe and come over to the Daily wire and watch the whole thing
