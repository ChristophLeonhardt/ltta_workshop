BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> Shannon: STICK AROUND.
MORE RESULTS ARE COMING AND WE
APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS.
>> THE MACHINE WILL BE HERE.
>> Shannon: WITH ALL THAT IN
MIND, LET'S BRING A MATT GORMAN,
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE
NATIONAL CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE.
>> GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT
IS AND WHAT DEMOCRATS THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE.
DEMOCRATS DIDN'T JUST BREAK THE
GLASS, THEY THREW BACK A FLAMING
CATCHER OUT THE WINDOW.
THEY SPENT $7 MILLION JUST TO
GET A SINGLE DEMOCRAT THROUGH TO
THE GENERAL ELECTION, AND
TONIGHT, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE
THAT WILL HAPPEN.
>> Shannon: OKAY.
LET'S TALK FOR THE GOVERNOR'S
RACE IN CALIFORNIA, WE SPENT A
LOT OF TIME ON THAT, AND HOW
CRITICAL IT IS IN THE FALL TO
GETTING G.O.P. VOTERS TO SHOW UP
IN THE POLLS FOR SOME OF THESE
OF THE RACES, I READ THE
ANALYSIS FROM THE "L.A. TIMES,,"
ANY PAPER YOU PICK, SAYS IS A FL
BARON FOR COX.
IF HE WINDS UP IN THE PRIMARY,
THE GENERAL ELECTION, WITH THE
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, HE HAS NO
CHANCE OF WINNING.
>> JOHN COX CAN BE COMPETITIVE.
NOT AN EXPERT ON GOVERNORS
RACES.
WE ARE MONITORING THE GAS TAX
REPEAL, WHICH WILL BE ON THE
BALLOT.
THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE
MOTIVATOR DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY.
I WAS JUST OUT THERE.
GAS IS APPROACHING $5 A GALLON.
I DON'T SEE DEMOCRATS MARCHING
IN THE STREETS TO DEFEND THAT.
SO ACTUALLY, THERE IS A RECALL
ELECTION IN A STATE SENATE
DISTRICT BUT OVERLAPS WITH
CALIFORNIA'S 39TH DISTRICT, THE
DISTRICT OF RETIRING CONGRESSMAN
ED ROYCE.
VOTERS IN MY DISTRICT ARE TRYING
TO RECALL A DEMOCRAT WHO'S BEEN
AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF THE GAS
TAX, AND WE'LL GET VERY CLOSE IN
THE DISTRICT, MIGHT WIN
AND RECALL THAT STATE SENATOR.
I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE A
HARBINGER OF A REPUBLICANS
ENTHUSIASM IN THE FALL.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT
ALABAMA.
CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA ROBY PICKED
UP THAT SEAT YEARS AGO, NOT THAT
LONG AGO, AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
TONIGHT AND SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT
OUT OF THE PRIMARY, SHE'S GOING
TO HAVE TO RUN AGAINST A RUNOFF
CANDIDATE, SOMEONE WHO SHE'S
FACED BEFORE.
THINK OF THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE.
CONGRESSWOMAN ROBIE HAD A STRONG
SHOWING TONIGHT, AND OF COURSE,
WE STAND BEHIND HER.
AN INCUMBENT, PART OF THE
PRIMARY PATRIOT PROGRAM, AND WE
WILL SUPPORT HER IN JULY.
>> Shannon: WHAT OTHER RACES
ARE OF KEY INTEREST TO YOU?
A LOT OF FOCUS ON
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THERE
WILL BE RACES WHERE YOU ARE ABLE
TO BOX OUT A DEMOCRAT FROM
GETTING INTO EITHER ONE OF THE
TWO TOP POSITIONS?
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD HAPPEN.
OUR GOAL HAS BEEN THE SAME ALL
ALONG.
WE JUST WANT TO GET A SINGLE
REPUBLICAN THROUGH TO THE
GENERAL, WE ARE PRETTY KEY THAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT.
WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON GET OUT
THE VOTE IN ORANGE COUNTY,
WEST COAST OFFICE THERE THAT HAS
MADE OVER A MILLION PHONE CALLS,
100 THOUSANDS OF DOORS DOWN
THERE, WE'VE ALSO DONE TARGETED
GET OUT THE VOTE ADS ON DIGITAL
PLATFORMS.
THE NAME OF THE GAME FOR US IS
TO ENSURE THAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS
TURNED OUT, ALSO, UP IN THE
CENTRAL VALLEY, THAT SEAT
UNEXPECTEDLY DEMOCRATS BUT THERE
IS A CHANCE, A POSSIBILITY, THE
TRIGGER REPUBLICANS GET IN
THERE.
OF COURSE, WE STAND BEHIND
CONGRESSMAN DENHAM.
ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRATS
ARE COMING UP SHORT.
IT SPEAKS TO THE INTRAPARTY
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS H
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS E
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS O
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS R
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS T
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS C
PARTY.
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW THE
PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED TO WEIGH
IN ON SOME KEY RACES WITH
ENDORSEMENTS AND TWEETS AND
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.
HOW DOES THAT PLAY IN PLACES
LIKE CALIFORNIA, A PLUS OR
MINUS?
>> IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO BE
ENDORSED BY THE LEADER OF YOUR
PARTY.
I CAN SPEAK FOR THE NRC SEE, WE
DON'T GET INVOLVED IN OPEN SEAT
PRIMARIES, WHOEVER EMERGES,
WE ALSO IMPORT THEM IN THE FALL.
WE ALSO STAND BEHIND THE MEMBERS
WE ALSO STAND BEHIND THE MEMBER
MEMBERS, CONGRESSMAN DANA
ROHRABACHER, CONGRESSMAN JEFF
DUNHAM, AND OTHER REPUBLICANS
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> Shannon: GIVEN THE AMOUNT
OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND THE
CLOSENESS OF SOME OF THESE
RACES, IT MAY BE A LITTLE WHILE
BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
