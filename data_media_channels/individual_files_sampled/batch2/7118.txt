the community of Asheville North Carolina is reeling today following the release of police body cam footage that showed an interaction with an african-american resident in the area who they stopped over jaywalking now the video has gone viral and it's nearly nine minutes long but we do have the relevant portions of that video to show you and it's incredibly disturbing to watch but understand that on the day Johnny Germain rush was approached by the officers he was walking home after the end of his dishwashing shift at a Cracker Barrel restaurant so he gets off work and apparently he jaywalks and the police were not too happy about it and so they approached him and words were exchanged if you watch the full video which we will link to in the description box below you can see rush essentially telling the cops I'm tired I just got off work just stop harassing me they asked him do you want to get a ticket or do you want to be arrested he's like do whatever you need to do just stop harassing me and then it escalates to what we're about to show you and again the video is incredibly graphic but it gives you a sense of why the community is so upset take a look do not stop put your hands behind your back so luckily rush didn't die from that interaction more often than not when we cover these types of stories someone loses their life but there were two cops present at the scene one of them was officer Chris Hickman who's been with the police force for some time and then he was with a trainee by the name of Moreno rog√©rio and he has not resigned he is still employed by the police department however Chris Hickman has since resigned since this incident and also the police chief Tami Hooper said that she would be happy to resign if that would quell the public discontent I'm sick of it man I'm sick of seeing this and all right look obviously there's a racial component this area is 12% black and and very segregated and I'm tired of seeing the cops pushing down a black guy's head into the concrete etc but there's arguably an even bigger class component to it so he was jaywalking I look I keep using Beverly Hills the example but he doesn't matter in Asheville North Carolina if it was a businessman and not a dishwasher you think they're gonna treat him like that you think they're gonna tase him over and over again you think they're gonna you know grind his head into the ground and punch him in the head four times they're not gonna do that to a guy that's a doctor or a lawyer or a businessman or the most important person in America or political donor right they're not gonna do it that too I mean you know it and so then they wonder why not just the poor with the middle class are tired of sometimes oftentimes literally being crushed and we feel the weight of that power crushing us and and I'm sick of it we're all sick of it and so then some people will say well look he should have done what the cop said okay well first of all he was jaywalking after a long day just what are you picking on him for again if he was in a suit there's no way the cops stopped him and you know that you know it for a fact okay but let's say that they do right and then they get into this altercation you know it started with jaywalking you know the guy's not dangerous etc and he says at one point is Hannah pointed out and it's in the tape he says look dude like you want to get it arrested or a ticket he's like do whatever you got to do so it's not like he's like some wild guy was not listening to direction and appears dangerous he says do whatever you want to do and so they they decide I mean at most you should give him a ticket right why would you choose arrest over a ticket why would you choose to escalate the situation rather than de-escalate it because like what the excuse the cops use all the time is I was afraid for my life right the dude is a jaywalker and he told you to write him a ticket and and instead of writing him a ticket you chose to arrest them to escalate the situation then of course the number one thing the right-wing will say is why do you run well if this is how african-americans get treated day in day out all across the country what would you do would you be like oh great the cops are here I bet they're here to help me no you get scared you get legitimately scared also I mean look there have been instances where a person has been shot and killed by a cop even after complying and being incredibly careful so falando Castille is the person who you know comes to mind off the top of my head he literally told the cop I have a licensed gun in the vehicle cop asks him to you know Oh license and registration and as he reaches for it shot and killed so look I think that in this case I know this sounds ridiculous but I've become so incredibly desensitized to this type of violence that if if the person doesn't die from excessive force I feel relieved I mean everyone should feel relieved right but you see these stories throughout the country and in a lot of cases people don't make it alive and I'm so happy that he didn't lose his life over this now he did get charged following the incident but the charges were later dropped police records show that he was charged with second degree trespass come on impeding traffic assault on a government official and resisting a public officer in September though the district attorney in Asheville reviewed the body camera video and decided to dismiss all charges also I wanted to show you another very short portion of the video because it kind of gives you a sense of how the cops felt about this whole situation after it had gotten physical take a look no but all over me from his face so backup arrives they ask if he's okay they asked the cop if he's okay and he says I have blood all over me from his face so they're not worried about the guy who's bleeding from the face they're worried about the guy who has the blood from the face on his arm from after assaulting him so look that's the other thing that annoys me about the police state that we live in and and so some people say the body cameras are not enough but it's a good start because they catch and stuff like this and and and your cell phones catch things like this before this happened non-stop we just never saw it right and then if anybody complained about they're like oh yeah probably a criminal complaining about good cops right so what are they traveling with the second-degree trespass impeding traffic so I wanted to see in the video because I write about it first then I'm looking at the video to see who was impeding traffic he had already crossed the street then they stopped him and then they are all over the street the guys who were impeding the traffic we're actually the cops well if you cared about impeding traffic you wouldn't have bothered to do all this crap in the middle the street so III want to focus on silver linings and I know that sounds crazy but just hear me out for a second first of all District Attorney drops charges and my guess is because he did review that body cam footage and saw that he was not impeding traffic and then trespassing where that's public space you know he did not trespass anywhere so the charges were dropped that's a good sign here's another good sign though following cases of excessive force or police brutality more often than not the police chief the police union you know the people involved will push back aggressively and deny any and all wrongdoing but that is not the case here and I thought that was interesting so as I mentioned the the police chief has suggested that she will step down if that makes the community feel more comfortable she also said the following the whole thing is bad right it's just a terrible egregious case the whole reason around the stop to begin with was just a bad thing from start to finish I look I gotta be honest you don't usually hear that kind of response or reaction from other cops much less a police chief so there is a feel like there is some progress and and that's something to focus on and keep pushing for real justice she also said that she was gonna fire hitman and he resigned right before she fired him and that's actually happens all the time but I wanted to get to the other charges as well because I'm like you're right there's some progress like I said the body cams are good but this happens all across the country they charged him with an assault on a government official and resisting a public officer who was assaulting who in that video so when now and then they tell us just no no just believe the cops that's don't blindly trusting that cops are all good guys when I see resisting an officer that and that's sometimes that's the only charge that means we arrested him for no reason because you have to have an underlying charge for resisting an officer most of the time they don't here they did the infamous second-degree trespass and impeding traffic and then assaulting a cop nine out of ten times means they assaulted you like as if you're actually sold to cop I want you to get arrested that's a terrible thing I don't want any assaults let alone on cops but now how many times have we seen they say oh he assaulted me then you look at the videotape and they kick in a crap out of him and they're like but yeah but I got his blood on me from punching him in the face so many times you see how he assaulted me and not only were they one of the cops punching and reputedly on on the head after he had already been restrained he's on the floor the other cop tases him simultaneously and by the way when he kept yelling I can't breathe I mean who did that remind you of Eric garner exactly yeah and so lastly I wanted to also point out the tasers the tasers initial idea was hey instead of like if you're in a really bad situation you're thinking of shooting someone instead of shooting them just stun them instead and I thought that's not what cops are gonna do okay like if they think there's any kind of danger they're gonna shoot they're gonna shoot right so what are they gonna use the stun guns for when they feel like someone's not complying and that's a hassle e at their arms behind them right and or they're not listening to me give me this stun gun we'll make this guy listen so it's not to stun them instead of shooting them it's to stun them to show them who's boss and you saw it happen there in that video they already got the guy down on the ground one cops already punching him in the head when the other ones like let's do a gratuitous done here okay give me the stun gun and by the way that stuff can give you a heart attack but they treat it lightly on the other hand you remember the guy on the ground was GD walking you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
