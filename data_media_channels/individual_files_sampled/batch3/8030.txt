♪ ♪ Laura: COLIN KAEPERNICK WANTS TO PUT PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE WITNESS STAND. KAEPERNICK IS A QUARTERBACK WHO BEGAN THE NFL'S KNEELING PROTEST DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. YAHOO SPORTS REPORTED THAT KAEPERNICK'S ATTORNEYS WANT TO SUBPOENA TRUMP. KAEPERNICK FILED A GRIEVANCE AFTER NO TEAM WOULD FIRE HIM. DOES HE HAVE A CASE. WE WILL DEBATE WITH THE REVEREND JESSE JACKSON. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TALKED SINCE 1998. GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS NFL PROTEST. DO YOU THINK THAT THE NFL LAWSUIT THAT KAEPERNICK APPARENTLY IS GOING TO FILE HIS GRIEVANCE WOULD BE A PROPER GROUNDS TO HAVE DONALD TRUMP THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TESTIFY AND WHY? WELL, HE IS EXERCISING HIS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PROTEST. THIS WAS REALLY ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY THAT WENT UNANSWERED. RODNEY KING BEATEN NEARLY TO DEATH WITHOUT CONQUENCES. PEOPLE KILLED IN NEW YORK WITHOUT CONSENSES. CONSEQUENCES. AND IN MISSOURI. THE KNEELING WAS A PEACEFUL PROTEST. HE WAS NOT TRYING TO DESECRATE THE FLAG. WE WERE ON OUR KNEES APPEALING FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN 1965. THERE IS NOTHING THREATENING ABOUT KNEELING TO THE FLAG. Laura: I GET THAT. WHAT DOES HA HAVE TO DO WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TESTIFYING IN A GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE NFL? HE HAS CONVINCED HIS CONSTITUENTS AND THE OWNERS TO PUT A PENALTY BEFORE THE PLAYERS IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT. Laura: HE HAS AN OPINION. IT'S MORE THAN HIS OPINION BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT. NO, NO, NO. Laura: AS A LEGAL MATTER THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS. THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO TESTIFY IN KAEPERNICK'S SUIT. HIS LAWYER SHOULD BE SANCTIONED. PART IS THE WAY, FOR EXAMPLE, PROTESTING USING THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES WHO DID NOT TAKE A KNEE LAST YEAR AS THE BASIS TO PUSH THE PUBLIC AGAINST BLACK . Laura: I WOULD HAVE HAD THEM COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE IF IT WAS 2 PEOPLE OR 1. I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR IF YOU AND ANYONE EXAMINING THIS WOULD SAY, IF YOU SUBMIT 80 NAMES TO THE SECRET SERVICE AND THEN 3 DAYS LATER, SAY, OH, SORRY, WE CAN'T MAKE IT. AND 2 PEOPLE AND THE MASCOT ARE COMING. WE WILL RESCHEDULE IT WHEN YOU ARE IN SINGAPORE. THAT'S JUST LAME. THEY DID THAT ON PURPOSE. WHAT LEBRON JAMES AND STEP CURRY ARE SAYING THIS ABOUT THE VIOLATIONS OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT. Laura: IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS FOR BLACK AMERICA UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION? DO YOU LIKE THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS OR THE SMALL BUSINESSES CREATED? HE INHERITED A GROWING ECONOMY. WITH PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. Laura: WAGES WERE NOT GOING UP. THEY WERE NOT GOING UP. AND THEY ARE STILL NOT. EKE EK MOST BLACKS MAKE LESS THAN $15 AN HOUR AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER MAKE LESS THAN $10. . Laura: WE WILL HAVE MORE MANUFACTURING JOBS WHERE PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO TO FANCY COLLEGES CAN GET A REALLY HIGH PAYING JOB LIKE THEY USED TO WHEN HE WITH TARIFFS PUT IN PLACE BY DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTS AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS. THE TARIFF THING HOW YOU TURN THAT INTO AN ANTI-BLACK THING? IT'S NOT JUST BLACK. IF , IN FACT THEY HAD A JOB, IN CHICAGO YOU HAVE TO GO 3 TRANSPORTATION TRANSFERS TO GET THE RIGHT TRANSPORTATION AND STUDENTS HAVE CREDIT CARDS DEBT. Laura: BILLIONS OF JOBS WERE SENT OVERSEAS AND BLED OFF TO MEXIO. THAT WAS GOOD FOR BLACK AMERICA? I DON'T THINK THAT WAS GOOD FOR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE AT ALL. WE LOST BILLIONS OF JOBS. THIS PRESIDENT IS BRINGING JOBS BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AND WORKING WITH JARED KUSHNER. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING GOOD FOR BLACK AMERICA STHAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? I AM NOT SAYING THAT. LAURA, YOU ARE CUTTING ME OFF. IF YOU ARE MAKE LESS THAN $15 AN HOUR, YOU ARE THE WORKING POOR AND THEY WANT TO CUT HEALTH CARE. Laura: HOW DID BARACK OBAMA CHANGE THAT? WELL, HE DIDN'T CHANGE IT SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH. THE FACT IS UNEMPLOYMENT 10% DOWN TO 5%. Laura: NOW IT'S AT A RECORD LOW. THE ATLANTIC HEADLINE ON THIS. HOW BARACK OBAMA FAILED AMERICANS. THE COUNTRY'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT NEVER PURSUED POLICIES TO CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. 26 MILLION AMERICANS Laura: AND RATES ARE GOING UP. I THINK THERE IS A LOT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND WORK WITH HIM ON PRISON REFORM AND OTHER ISSUES. I THINK THESE NFL PLAYERS COULD WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT. WELL, LAURA, WHEN YOU LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR CRACK COCAINE Laura: THAT'S NOT JUST HIM. THAT'S BEEN DONE FOR DECADES. THEN YOU FREE THEM UP. OPIOIDS ARE A HEALTH CRISIS. . Laura: YOU WERE PALS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS NOT PRESIDENT. WHAT HAPPENED? HE CHANGED. HE IS A GUY WHO LOOKED AT MARCHES IN VIRGINIA. HE CHANGED. I DIDN'T CHANGE. Laura: HE IS A DIFFERENT PERSON, YOU THINK? GLAD YOU CAME ON.
