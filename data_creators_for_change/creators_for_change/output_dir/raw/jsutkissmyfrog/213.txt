00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,490
when you go to a school<font color="#CCCCCC"> where there's a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">me fine my school is actually also quite</font>

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,039
uptight about makeup so really there was

25
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,110
only a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> left and that was hair</font>

26
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,879
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we were only allowed natural</font>

27
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,770
colors of hair beyond the ideal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

28
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,120
trying to convince teachers that there

the globe that have pink hair it was

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,979
hard it was hard generally my former

32
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,659
rebellion was ginger but why school was

33
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,070
rancid with jokes about homosexuality

34
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,320
and ginger so there's always scare<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
if you trimmed your fringe even if you

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,650
do everybody knows every you'd be in

37
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,390
math and somebody behind you be like oh

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,630
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's got highlights everywhere</font>

39
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,530
somebody would<font color="#E5E5E5"> yell their hair</font>

40
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,390
differently and they be compared to a

41
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,460
variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of garden plant like it was</font>

42
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,560
ridic even to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this day I carry with me</font>

43
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,630
some kind of like Laura changing my hair

44
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,009
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are gonna and because it's so</font>

45
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,270
close<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your face people feel and have</font>

46
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,530
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> something you know especially the</font>

47
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,579
people who see you in everyday life they

48
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:33,659
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd have to address it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

49
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is that recently I have been doing</font>

50
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">things from there that aren't as</font>

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,189
socially acceptable as other things like

52
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this I dreaded it that was awkward</font>

53
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,619
everybody pretty much everybody only

54
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,600
will I don't do no stop it this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be one of those decisions you make</font>

56
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,409
either it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an awkward social</font>

57
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,119
situation for a few weeks because people

58
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,590
felt like they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to acknowledge it but</font>

59
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,060
they also didn't want to condone it so

60
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,229
we were left with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of really</font>

61
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,670
awkward social space in which they were

62
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,950
like kid yeah and it's happened again I

63
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't my fringe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

64
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,610
feel like they need to address it but

65
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,750
also awkward is they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

66
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that through because they're also not</font>

67
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,200
very liars it just it was another rabbit

68
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,970
hole<font color="#CCCCCC"> of kind of people having to address</font>

69
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,590
the issue to my face but at the same

70
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,180
time falling into hilarious but also

71
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,130
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> awkward</font>

72
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,050
full of being like having to comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

73
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,910
also not<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to compromise truth</font>

74
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,530
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who go Oh</font>

75
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lina your hair and Lidge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps their eye</font>

76
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,910
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember months of eye contact</font>

77
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,680
flow between us or they leave the phrase

78
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,100
your hair in the air and you have to

79
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,350
somehow swallow that phrase and say

80
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">something back but you know you have you</font>

81
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,160
know you've dyed your hair coming up do

82
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,840
you know you dyed your hair they r

83
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,400
acknowledging you dyed your hair but

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not saying anything to further</font>

85
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,950
that conversation you you can't be the

86
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">person to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah it's awesome</font>

88
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,690
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also not that</font>

89
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,160
first news like oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

Natalie teenagers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not forgiving of</font>

92
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,270
that phrase they'll go yeah isn't

93
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I think it comes to living in space</font>

94
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,990
with other humans where yep you see each

95
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,490
other is it athletic objects where you

96
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,780
have so many tastes and we have so many

97
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,530
varieties of style nowadays and so so

98
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">many choices but everybody drives their</font>

99
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,430
own personal tastes and style real early

100
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,290
and then they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to define that</font>

101
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially at schools with uniform and</font>

102
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,990
have to have like your yin and yang

103
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,220
approached act like this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my style</font>

104
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,160
therefore this isn't my style and

105
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,900
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a binary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so when it comes</font>

106
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,520
to hair that's awkward because it's

107
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,660
attached from<font color="#E5E5E5"> hair to copy to think</font>

108
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
about it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a top that I can</font>

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna hate but like it's just an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> orc</font>

114
00:03:33,680 --> 00:00:00,000
could think to acknowledge socially
