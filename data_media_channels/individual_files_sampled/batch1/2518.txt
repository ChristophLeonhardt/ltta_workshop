so first tell me what the plan is with Express Scripts why merge with them sure so we're a global health service company were forward to have 95 million customer relationships around the world as we look at all of our business including in the United States we see that the still the number one need for Americans is to improve affordability and to do so in a very personalized fashion pharmaceutical services have quickly grown to about 25 percent of the overall cost equation with specialty pharmacy being about two-thirds of that 25 percent and about half of that is in the medical part of the promise so it presents an opportunity to further improve affordability also further improve quality because in America when there's a gap in health care so evidence-based care is not followed it typically ties to a pharmaceutical so that's point one point two is it expands our distribution reach there's a lot of ways in which Express Scripts distributes to employers health plans or governmental agencies that we don't so expands our distribution reach to touch more lives with our behavioral services our well-being services so improve affordability and personalization for our clients and customers improve quality and then expand reach or touch more lives and how are you going to increase affordability yeah so first you always have to have a strong foundation CIGNA's delivered the lowest or the best medical cost trend in the industry five years running and 2018 will be six years running and we do so by engaging the individuals trying to lower health risks people keep people healthy and then improve the quality of health care that's delivered Express Scripts has also delivered differentiated medical cost trends so we're building off of strength but the way we further build off that strength is further tighten and strengthen the relationship between an individual or patient with their physician we do that quite well through our collaborative accountable care relationships to use actionable information to predict or identify health risks before they happen so a pre diabetic before they become diabetic a coronary risk patient before they have the heart attack a high risk maternity mom and help that mom go full-term that's how you improve overall cost and quality and the combined capabilities as well as information enable us to do that even better and what do you think will change about the way of that healthcare looks in the future I think the biggest change we aspire for and as a company we're driving toward is more personalization so what do I mean by that typically in the United States most healthcare is purchased the programs are purchased insurance and related services through some intermediary an employer a governmental agency and they do good jobs to try to get the right package for the benefit of individuals but nobody's average we're all very unique so through information and through technological innovation you get a lot more personalization to the coverage to the modalities of communication to the access profile that works best for an individual so I think you'll see a lot more personalization of engagement from that standpoint and secondly for the medical professionals doctors as well as the manufacturers of devices and pharmaceuticals the rewards need to be much more oriented around the outcomes and the quality than the consumption so those are the two big changes we see and we're fueling and driving as a corporation and do you think it makes sense at all for healthcare to be tied to employers anymore given how much our workforce has changed yes so in the United States greater than 50 percent of Americans today get their health service support through an employer that is a manifestation from a long time ago post-world War two wage controls that existed but but we are where we are answer your questions yes I do and the reason why is an employer actually has a vested interest in helping to keep their employees healthy and productive and present from org standpoint to the worksite and the culture of an employer creates some mechanisms to engage in individual ways to communicate ways to provide on-site care ways to provide peer support program support etc so there's incentive alignment there's culture you could pull against and support it and then there's delivery mechanism so we think the answer is yes and we have a ton of bright spots where we could point to employers that have innovated with us and we've innovated with them and their employees and therefore their business is better off and those employees family members are better off because they're getting better more comprehensive health care and what do you think makes America different why are we spending so much in health care can you point to one thing that like our policies are something in America that that is a problem yeah so our system is quite different right we're a global company we do business all over the world so we were able to see systems in the most developed osed countries and developing countries around the world there's multiple differences first and foremost the United States is the largest SiC care intervention system in the world we spend the majority of our money and resources addressing people once they're sick we need to spend some more of our resources keeping people healthy in the first case and identifying people who are at risk of health events and lowering those health risks some other countries do that better through social service support community-based health support etc secondly we have more specialists and more hospitals per capita than other OECD countries and less primary care be it ob/gyn pediatrician family practitioners and and we need to moderate that a little bit again help to coordinate the whole person on the front end there's trade-offs in the way we've built our system as a company we've had a great success partnering with physicians through what we call collaborative accountable care relationships we have 375 of which that are up and running with physicians and another hundred twenty-five with hospitals and working more comprehensively but in a nutshell we wait too long in terms of trying to fix somebody once they're sick as opposed to engage on the front end and keep people healthy in the first place that's where Signet expands a lot of resources secondly we spend a lot more money on the high cost intervention as opposed to enabling the primary care physician the geriatrician the pediatrician to have more resources to help to coordinate care for individuals and we have a different pricing scheme relative to some of our services be they pharmaceutical otherwise first other parts of the world and when you look at the opioid crisis what do you think is something what will help that what do we need to do yeah in a way the opioid crisis is first it's something our country should be quite disappointed we allow it to transpire because essentially we've systematically poisoned our population in a way in terms of the mass consumption of opioids but if you step back it's another example that reinforces we try to answer problems with interventions so have a problem have an intervention as opposed to more comprehensively help individuals manage pain so stepping back we consume the vast majority of the world's pharmaceutical opioids for five percent of the world's population that doesn't really make sense as a company we step forward about two and a half years ago and said we're gonna reduce the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids by 25 percent for our customers working hand in glove with physicians to bring the consumption back to pre epidemic levels and we just thought to do that in three years I'm proud our company did it in 22 months and now we step forward and said in cities around the United States we're stepping forward as a pledge to reduce the rate of opioid and overdose related deaths by 25 percent and the way you do that is one person at a time and working hand in glove with medical professionals and community leaders so to me it's a problem that is really symptomatic of an overconsumption of health services unnecessarily and not addressing the whole person in coordination with a physician and the bright spot is when you work collaboratively with a physician in the individual you could move the needle forward and I'm proud of what our company did and how do you do that on such a large scale because like you said it is a very one-to-one thing and how do you create an incentive to not just to to reduce the number of prescriptions without hurting people yeah I know a really important powerful question so when you're a large corporation no matter what industry you're in the risk is that you kind of come at things in a homogeneous way we believe everything is local all healthcare is personal all healthcare is local so we operate a very localized model aided by global resources so the engagement happens with the local practicing physician with our physician leaders talking hand in glove with those individuals it comes with convening community leaders faith-based leaders employers elected officials locally because the solution and community a is different than the solution and community B based on the local orientation and in fact our strategy is go deeper go local go beyond so we're quite serious about that localization in terms of the personalization the engagement at the local level and trying to drive it but it's with the clinicians not to the clinicians and it's with the consumer a patient not to the consumer patient and going back to Express Scripts when you look at a merger and you're when you look beyond just the synergies and the business opportunities what else are you looking for what culture or management things are you concerned about yeah I think which the culture is quite important because we global health service company we're not an insurance company we exist to improve the health well-being in sense of security the people we serve or a service based company so you start with a notion of purpose what is your purpose we're a publicly traded company and we get that or a performance oriented company we get that but you could also be mission based so looking at a culture that is market oriented commercially oriented consumer oriented respect and understand the clinical community and want to work with others and partner with others second a deep empathy and humanity so I was with the Express Scripts team on Monday of this week all day in st. Louis meeting with colleagues talking about and there's a deep passion a community based orientation when you have those ingredients and an open mind and it's relative to sustained innovation success is possible if you're not commercially oriented if you're not consumer oriented if you don't deeply respect the clinical community if you're not community oriented if you don't have the empathy and humanity and your and your coworkers we have 47,000 colleagues they have 27,000 colleagues it's tough to be a service company so that that fiber is quite important in both companies share that fiber and you have a new book the courage to go forward can you tell me what inspired that yeah it's a only book so it's not a new book the only book I ever append and I was fortunate to co-author it with the founder of Achilles international Achilles international it's a not-for-profit that focuses resources on helping people largely with disabilities both physical and otherwise set goals pursue those goals have support around them and can complete those goals we've partnered with them for about a decade I've personally been highly active with them for eight of those 10 years and there's some really powerful stories that we wanted to tell their founder and myself in the book around these profiles and courage of individuals overcoming phenomenal obstacles to set goals that many people would think are impossible and then introduce a little recipe of how you pursue those goals because you just don't will them to happen and then we introduce this theme of micro communities have very small aggregations of individuals one two or three could wrap around and support an individual and pursuit of that goal so we wanted to tell the stories because there's many stories in there we want to introduce the recipe and with an objective of helping people have the courage to set goals they may think are out of the reach and help individuals realize that you could change people's lives one at a time by activating in these micro communities and lastly the purpose was quite noble because a hundred percent of the proceeds go to benefit achilles International and further that mission and can you tell me what a micro community is so a micro community it's a term we made up right so what it means to me is I'll give a concrete example but WT wounded veteran sets the goal of running their first ever marathon on prosthetics never wearing a marathon before they had prosthetics not a goal that seems achievable one or two people wrap around that individual and do everything humanly possible to enable that goal to be achieved they're gonna pull from other resources but the intimacy of those one or two people and I've had the blessing and fortune of being that one or two persons many times and seeing the power of that and failures not an option and we're gonna achieve that goal and then the leverage effect afterward for that person who realizes that goal was achieved to set other goals in their lives one of the one of the gentlemen the first person I ever guided Matias he set a goal to actually become a police officer there's a double amputee well he had to accomplish all the able-bodied tests which were largely deemed to be impossible failed multiple times long the journey today he's a Long Island police officer so that's those are the powerful messages you want to get through but the micro communities are essentially to instill the ability for one or two individuals to make huge change and then the leverage effect of that
