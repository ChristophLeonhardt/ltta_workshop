no matter what there is always good news and we think good news rules this one's excellent today marks International Day of the girl and we are honoring a remarkable one who is making a difference for young girls across the world after overcoming incredible odds in an almost fatal attack Malala decided to make the most of the second chance she had been given and set up the Malala fund which is devoted to providing free safe quality education for girls around the world there are still 130 million girls out of school and the Malala fund is working to break down the barriers preventing those girls from getting the education they so deserve joining me now is the CEO of Malala fund Farah Mohammed Farah welcome and happy girl's day to you you've got a new report out that offers concrete evidence yes about why the world works better when girls get to go to school what you find that's right for happy international and girls day to you as well I'll tell you that we came up with a report that shows that and we're calling it full force by the way and it shows that 1 billion girls we left behind if we do not make the proper investments and this comes on the heels of a report we did earlier this summer that showed if you do not educate girls for a full 12 years then we will be losing about 30 trillion dollars to the global economy so these are really striking numbers backed up with great research that showed that we need to make more investments clearer investments in girls education so they have safe quality free access and you're right there are a hundred and thirty million girls out of the world and we simply cannot afford to lose that resource full force is out too today and actually came out yesterday and it has very specific asks of governments to increase their donor aid if they are a country like the UK or Canada start putting more of their aid toward education if they're a donor country at least spend six percent of what they're doing toward education so these are very specific asks that we know will move the dial on getting more girls into school and that is malala's dream those of us and it's most of us without your expertise generally assume things are getting better for girls across the world but Malala started this foundation in 2014 tell us in the last four years what has changed for girls well I'll tell you one thing that has changed I think the world is starting to wake up to the reality that if we don't educate girls were in trouble we know that if you educate girls that the chance of war will fall in half we know that climate change goes down things are getting better for girls in that the issue is more prevalent in society have more leaders my own Prime Minister Trudeau did something macro is looking at doing something we have business leaders like Tim Cook of Apple City starting to look at how businesses so for girls more people are paying attention and then that I hope will follow up with action and that's what we need we can't just have people say it's a good thing to do we need to do it we need to understand the math we need to understand what are we gonna lose if we don't do it and I think that's what people are starting to focus focus on and I also think that technology is a big thing for girls assuming of course we know how to use it when to use it and who to use it with private companies organizations and the government working together and everyday citizens to help every girl on this planet and every boy rise up hey there are sales from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
