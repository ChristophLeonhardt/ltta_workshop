hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report coming to you through smart TV I can see what you're doing right now oh my god don't do that Stacy can you see what I'm doing of course I can so I want to talk to you about a concept and a reality a new reality that we have entered since 2008 and we've spoken about it before but this is an update literally the headline is update the financial repression index because remember in 2008 and 2009 when the financial crisis happened the latest of a long line of them what the United States Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world did was they lowered interest rates to zero but part of that is that they were already kind of low by historical standards when you were working on Wall Street interest rates were up at 20% and for the past 30 40 years they've been declining declining declining this is important because at the end of q1 2018 almost eighty four percent of all income earned by banks on leverage went to bank shareholders as a result of the feds policy of quantitative easing while their remainder went to depositors and bond investors 30 years ago that situation was reversed so I'm gonna show you that chart this is 30 years ago 1984 when you were first on Wall Street and interest rates were higher so bond investors and depositors received a lot more of the profit from banks now interest rates are zero or even negative in some places and therefore all the profits are going to bank shareholders in the equity markets it's the real flipping right so Bank shares become a pasture mechanism for financial repression so very few people in America own stock and very few people would have a meaningful portfolio of bank shares that are paying dividends that would match what they used to get on a deposit account at a bank so the central bank by lowering interest rates near zero to call that money out of pensions and people savings accounts and they essentially open the gateway for banks to hoard cash and not lend it out but to pay their shareholders increasing levels of dividends and that's why people like Jamie Dimon and Lloyd Blankfein became billionaires because they've been riding the wave of financial repression that money came out of savers accounts it came out of retirement accounts it was moved thanks to the feds engineering like a crane that comes in and picks up dirt and moves it over here they just took hundreds of billions of dollars if not a trillion or more dollars picked it up and moved it into the bank accounts of their friends yes it's something like 80% of all stocks are owned by 10% of the population of America all the bonds are held by those are considered safer and by law a lot of your pension funds can only invest in pensions or your state you know and local municipalities have to invest in safer investments like bonds so they've been removing it from basically passive investors who have no alternative but to invest in those bonds and they've been taking it from those chumps sitting there like helpless chubs and they've taken the money and transferred it to a very small percentage of the already wealthy population these are people with already own their homes already owned as much you know safe investments as they they need they're wealthy enough to buy senators and congressmen to change the laws to enact policies to make it possible for this financial crane effect of moving hundreds of billions trillions of dollars from workers to plutocrats that's how wealthy they are and now they're even wealthier so I want to read the final quote here about this financial repression and by the way this is from Chris Whalen and he wrote this in June but I just found it and it's a still relevant to today in the world we're living in the secular decline in US interest rates has very clearly been paid for by depositors and debt investors while the share of interest earnings apportioned to bad equity investors has grown in the 1980s almost three-quarters of bank earnings on loans and investments flowed to depositors and bond investors as recently as 2008 the distribution of profits was roughly 50/50 right that's because the fractional reserve banking system has transformed banking in a way where instead of loaning out to borrowers deposits and making a spread on the deposit rate and the interest rate banks just hoard all the cash and they don't lend out anything on loans they print more money when they love when you create a mortgage and you take out a half a million dollar mortgage the bank doesn't lend you the money they have from deposit they simply create that half a million dollars but they touch of a button and it's invented it's created out of thin air that's why the money supply keeps expanding in this way but the money velocity keeps going down to historic lows it's because of this ability thanks to guys like John McCain starting in the early 90s to transform the financial landscape to favor plutocrats well I also want to importantly point out here that in the mainstream media the corporate media when you tune in to Rachel Maddow or Chris Hayes or Fox News or anything those guys are making twenty thirty forty million dollars a year they own a lot of shares their economy is doing very very well New York City and San Francisco and Los Angeles their real estate is also doing very very well their world is doing very well on financial repression they do not see the results of financial repression because they don't need interest on a savings account they don't own as many bonds as your pension fund so the fact is this could also explain why since 2008 when when the likes of Rachel Maddow look around the economy they don't understand why people are so angry they don't understand why people vote for brexit they don't understand why people vote for Trump they don't understand their anger but these people have been financially repressed not only on their savings account but they can't even save because their their incomes are going down because their incomes are to this stuff but you can use the rule of 72 to graphically explain this pretty easily so if you're part of the class that's engaging in financial repression and you're getting seven percent on your money versus one percent it doesn't sound like a lot but it means you're doubling your money every ten years but if you're only getting one percent on your savings that means you're doubling your money every 70 years so that's the difference between the rich and poor in America this compounded rate of interest for a 7% and hire Warren Buffett compounds money at 22% first the average worker is compounding money at less than 1% and you look at what has happened since 2008 and there's been a massive massive explosion in the wealth and income gap Jeff Bezos has made 260 million dollars per day in 2018 how does he make that from a savings account on the zero presenter the zero point four percent interest being paid on deposit accounts no because his wealth is tied up into stocks and stock prices are going up because of financial repression Warren Buffett is now worth more money than he was in 2008 many of the billionaires are wealthier than 2008 because of their stock portfolios because of this financial repression I've always said that social security in America should include a mandatory portion of stock exposure that anyone with Social Security account again they should have that fund get 1% of every new issue that's ever underwritten on Wall Street 1% should go into the Social Security account so that this amount of financial repression and financial engineering and you know like tinkering can be spread out and you don't have ultimately now the possibility of so much social cohesion risk as the Economist magazine likes to call it otherwise would call that rioting that would undermine everything well social cohesion risk is not just rioting it is voting for Donald Trump it is voting for breaks it I know you are totally against breaks it but I think it is a result of this and the fact is that our financial news our corporate media entirely the economy on what the stock market is doing but as this chart shows is that the stock market it actually impacts only those sort of people that are speaking on the corporate media those people are happy with it that's what they focus on and they can't understand why somebody out in Oklahoma might not be as happy that you know with how great the stock market is doing but the financial repression is real Boris Johnson is no Donald Trump it's not that I'm against brexit is that that there's nobody in the UK could pull it off there's no political talent of that caliber that's what all I've been saying for the last two years I want to also talk about Europe while we're over there because they have also had the consequences of the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis where by we have a lot of anger and the mainstream media can't understand it they can't understand why people want to trash everything and want to kick the elites in the teeth and this is a remarkable story from last week's newspaper in the Ireland state pays market price to buy back properties that the the government sold at a discount to vulture funds that's the article right there the state has begun buying back properties from vulture funds which it originally controlled via nama by paying a market price for assets that they themselves had sold at a deep discount to US financial Giants in recent years that that's a common fraud and we saw it we mentioned the savings and loan crisis recently the government ended up buying back assets that they had sold at a discount and they're gaming the government so nama in Ireland which was the result of the crash of Ireland due to over speculation is been implicated in a numerous number of highly questionable transactions that many would call fraud and this is just the result of in governance by the cactus stock recei ruled by the least qualified and kleptocrats okay these US financial giants who benefited from this those guys are friends with the guys on Bloomberg television with the guys from MSNBC and CNBC and Fox they're on the business channels here they're on the corporate run media and they're the great friends they hang out at the Hamptons they're all friends and they're very probably really nice guys in person right yeah with their friends with their mutual millionaire billionaire friendly about RTE with Irish so definitely culpable but that's what I'm saying is as I said at the top of the show that corporate media thinks why are they don't understand why people are angry because they're friends they're private equity and hedge fund guys are really nice people they give to some charities they're really nice people but when the ordinary the taxpayer funded this and the taxpayer is still struggling the incomes there are still down that the homeless situation is far worse than it was and all you get here is that the deal will see the unit's ultimately made available for social housing but also raises questions over the government strategy of selling discounters loads and some private equity funds only to ultimately end up buying them back for more later like it's just such understatement when it applies to you know basically immoral behavior by the elite the world it's not a question of strategy it's a it's that they fulfilled their plan of pilfering and kleptocracy perfectly that's not a that's not a strategic error that's a strategic success and here is that that's a strategic success indeed as you read from the final headline here rich Americans have never been more comfortable relative to the poor and that is according to Bloomberg News higher income arrogance are pulling ahead of those making less over the last few months there's even even worse than it has been well oh my croissant my stocks so we'll be back after this break don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to the soon-to-be brexit 'add isle of the devil's the UK and oust McLeod Alistair welcome back to the Kaiser report that's my pleasure max now to follow up on what we've been chatting about here in the previous episode you talked about weaponizing a currency that's a very interesting phrase you know it reminds me Pablo Escobar's famous drug dealer from Mexico used to Colombia used to talk about Plata o Plomo I believe is the phrase either it's silver or lead like either you give us all your money or we're gonna blow your head off in America this phrase weaponizing a currency it's like here's the fiat money either you take it or lead you get blood you get your head blown off this is what the New York Times says it's backed by men with guns they replica and this has led to countries around the world saying we don't want to get our heads blown off by forcing us to take Fiat worthless coupons that enrich the plutocracy at the expense of a democracy and even Germany is saying you know what we want to get out of this mess and they've indicated that they're open to talks about an alternate to the Swift system and something less political they say what would that look like I'll stir to walk us through that scenario please well we don't know what will replace the dollar you know at this stage I can see that the some attractions for the Euro for anyone who lives not too far away from the euro zone the yen has also got quite a lot of stability but who's interested in the end I mean it is actually a real problem and basically the Americans have used this to their advantage they know there is no alternative to the dollar therefore you go with us or we kill you basically has been the message the problem is that you can do this to an extent against small nations and they've done this recently against particularly Iran and arguably perhaps a little bit against Venezuela they went Venezuela's really created its own problems so you can see that this is giving a message to every other nation which relies on the dollar for its cross-border trade that this is actually something not very safe to do you need to have an alternative now inevitably in the long run I think Chinese would expect Asia to gravitate towards some sort of you are but having said that I think they've got to back that you are with something a little more tangible than the Full Faith and Credit of the Chinese government that I don't think is gonna cut enough ice and I think this is why for a long time China has been accumulating gold now she has declared reserves I think at roughly 1800 tons but she's got a lot more girl than that and so have her citizens remember that the Chinese have been as a government accumulating gold since 1983 which is when the regulations came in appointing the People's Bank with that function so they've gone through the big bear market that we had in the 80s and into the 90s and remember in those days that the Indians weren't allowed to buy the earlier only imported by I in the market after 1992 so the price is way down too so if you look at the capital flows and all the rest of it and say that the Chinese deliberately had this policy of diversifying out of the doric even then which I would certainly believe and I'm certain is true then 10% of the gold that they will have acquired since then comes to something in excess of 20,000 tons no we don't know whether this is true but what we can surmise is that China has a lot more gold than she actually admits in her reserves now that being the case she can begin to back her own currency with gold whether she'll do this or not I don't know part of her problem is that if he went on to that policy she would kill the dollar and if he kills the dollar the effect around the world would actually be very very negative not just for America but for everybody else so she's stepping very cautiously on this but I do see to answer your question max that over a period of time we're likely to evolve more towards Chinese you are which will be made to look synthetically more stable than the current situation and that I can that's at that I feel very strongly is likely to happen and I think if you want some confirmation of this China's main partner Russia is already down that route right but the question really was about Germany and you know you say that China doesn't really publish its gold holdings accurately the belief is that has a lot more gold then it says it does certainly none of the gold a mine is exported and they mine something like 300 tons a year last I checked but let's talk about Germany they do publish their gold holdings there's something like 3,000 tons and Russia has now like 3,000 tons those two together that's 6,000 tons versus the u.s. 8,000 tons so Germany and Russia are powerful sooo now with the u.s. in terms of gold holdings and Germany is saying they want out of the US dollar Germany is Europe Europe is a 17 trillion dollar economy - the UK in a couple of years so we won't talk about that but it's still a very strong economy and so they combined with Russia is a force to be reckoned with and of course the pipelines that are going back and forth the energy that's going back and forth Germany seems like the swing state is is this rejection of the US dollar around the world going to push Germany into the arms of Russia Alister well you've only got to look at the map and you can see that the most natural trading partner for Germany actually is on their eastern border and we can skip through the Ukraine and Belorussia and you've then got Russia and not only that but bear in mind that the Silk Road is already propelling trains from Beijing to places like doesn't off in round about two weeks I mean the communications for pushing Goods and all the rest of it is just the infrastructure is there and it is being improved so the answer is yes Germany is moving out of the American sphere of influence and the other thing of course as I mean I don't know if you remember but in the Obama days the CB the the CIA were found a spying on Angela Merkel they were tapping her her phone now ever since then of course there's been this sort of suspicion that we know this sort of thing goes on all the time but to find it out is actually a little upsetting now we have President Trump and president Trump turns around and tells the EU he crosses his arms like that and he's not going to listen to them and they know it and they think this is no longer the special relationship that we've always had and enjoyed with America and NATO protecting a small restaurant so in a sense I think it is recent developments in particular this almost cast the EU adrift and the EU of course is being very much led by Germany and Germany has the interest in the Nord Stream pipeline and America is trying to deny that and say you're to buy our gas instead but no that's already in place and I think that the ties between Germany and Russia are likely to increase apart from anything else we mosque is a really good market for Mercedes I mean I think this is their one of the most under covered stories of the past ten years is that Germany as you say is no longer under the influence or losing it in terms of the US and it's moving toward the going east but let's go back to China now because China is really more on that trade issue and I promise get back to the trade issues so regarding the trade war with China ouster a recent comment from Chinese officials suggests they believe these maneuvers are really about containing China and preventing its rise talking about the the thing that sanctions with China etc so now they get into this whole trade business because you also dovetail this issue into reaction possibly of China and dumping dollars and the the the effect that this would have etcetera so you just expand on that answer yes well specifically due to trade I mean there is little doubt in my mind and I think in the minds of most serious geopolitical strategists that America's moves are designed to try and contain the influence of China but it's a game which I think America has already lost and but nonetheless she's now trying to pursue a trade related tariff war now our trade related tariff war does actually no good for America at all was apart from anything else her consumers end up paying the tariffs so it's a self-inflicted wound if you like as well as that American businesses own a lot of subsidiaries in places like China and so you're putting tariffs against your own companies and I think that sooner or later that's going to be realized and they're going to have to back off one thing is interesting is that the tariff negotiations in America are being handled by the Treasury rather than the Commerce Department now I think the Treasury Department will be more elide to the financial effects of introducing tariffs or pursuing tariffs or than the Commerce Department ever could be so that I think is a plus the Chinese have just walked away from immediate negotiations now we're not too sure why but I would guess that with the midterm elections coming up they probably feel that it is not a reliable negotiation to be had ahead of a very emotional time if you like the president Trump so they will probably revisit adopters I have no doubt that they will iron it out there will be some tariffs yes there will be a new relationship but there's just too much damage likely to be done by the introduction of 200 billion dollars worth of tariffs and it won't actually do anything to reduce America's trade deficit that is the result of the budget deficit well let's get philosophical for a second you know it seems like Trump wants to go back to mercantilism in other words all the trade that's been going on for the past 20-30 years has been under the rubric of monetarism in the financialization of the global economy and the idea that all can win in world where central banks can print money for infinity and it seems to be that this globalized vision of the world is now being rejected and Trump wants to go back to the 19th century he wants to go back to mercantilism he wants every one country to compete on its own merits and get back to a David Ricardian kind of world of competing on what you do best and he's willing to take that gamble he's willing to throw whatever he needs to throw under the bus to see this return to mercantilism your thoughts I agree with you I mean that's he's a businessman he's trying to run America like a business but what he doesn't understand is that the reason there is a trade deficit isn't because Chinese or whoever's product is ultra competitive and all you need to do is make it less competitive and the trade deficit will disappear that's not the case what happens in an economy is that if the government runs a huge brake deficit it tends to get reflected in in a trade deficit so budget deficit trade deficit the twin deficits were all aware of that and the reason this happens is that if you're going to run a big budget deficit then by definition what you're doing is you're expanding either the quantity of money or bank credit one way or the other to finance it and it does it we gotta cut her off there thanks so much for being on the Kaiser report that's my pleasure max all right that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser it's tastier but one thing I guess tiles from a cloud of gold money if you want to catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
