I interviewed David Menzies about this yesterday but I want to talk about a bit more today how Justin Trudeau's liberals are blocking private donations to military veterans and their families if the donors don't meet the liberal political hygiene test it's just like Trudeau's illegal demand that Canadians swear and attestation that they support Justin Trudeau on moral issues like abortion and transgenderism before they're allowed to get a summer jobs grant it's that absolutely against our constitution of course which guarantees that the government cannot discriminate against you based on your religion or belief but they're doing that so Trudeau banned about 1,400 companies and organisations from accessing the summer jobs program because they had a conservative point of view on moral issues imagine for a moment if Stephen Harper had required citizens to say they agreed with him on some moral issue before letting them have access to some government spending program like welfare that had nothing to do with the moral issue in question anyways there would be mass protests there would be mass lawsuits there would be demands that the governor-general remove him as unfit to be Prime Minister but really in this case 95 percent of the media and legal and political establishment agrees with Trudeau pro-life people are yucky and people are terrified to criticise transgenderism so yeah it's a big shrug well the story today is that the Trudeau Liberals are bringing that same sort of political exclusion to charitable projects for our troops it started at Christmastime when we hear the rebel received a tip from a soldier at CFB Borden he sent me a copy of the official newspaper on the base which talked about Christmas hampers basically a Food Bank it being Trudeau's army now they don't call them Christmas hammers anymore because the word Christmas is banned just like the word mankind is being replaced with people kind but what shocked me was that these Christmas hampers were weren't for people in the neighboring community around the base it was for soldiers on the base who are living in poverty while they work for the Canadian Forces a food bank on the base for soldiers and what earth made doubly was at Trudeau's propaganda magazine the base newsletter was asking that other soldiers fill in that gap that instead of the government helping to top up the poor soldiers other soldiers should do that what we immediately decided to help as you know we like to do crowdfunding especially for military causes I don't know if you remember at Sun News we raised a hundred thousand dollars for the son of Nathan Cirillo the Canadian soldier who was killed by a Muslim terrorists at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and we raised money for the college fund for the two children of Christopher spear the US Army medic murdered by Omar Khadr so we loved helping our troops or in the case of the spear kids are allies troops and we set ourselves a modest goal for CFB Borden ten thousand dollars for the Christmas hampers well of course our viewers are so generous we actually raised more than fifteen thousand dollars that would be enough to cover the whole tab for the Christmas hampers I think but when our own David Menzies went to the base to drop off the check they refused it they literally refused it by they I don't mean the ordinary soldier certainly not the soldier who wrote to us confidentially to ask for help no I mean the PR soldiers the political brass the ones who follow the interests of Justin Trudeau as opposed to the interests of the rank and file they literally told David to go away they literally refused to let us give the donations to the needy soldiers they blocked us their excuses were so lame and they kept changing first they said they didn't need the money soldiers on the base had already come up with enough I'm not sure if I believe that and if a soldier's family is short of money for groceries in December their propaganda should have money for groceries in January also but we said hey no problem take the money and keep it for next year do whatever you want for it with it it's for the soldiers they said no no and they came up with another excuse oh this wasn't really about the money they said it was about soldiers on the base participating together it was a team spirit kind of thing no need for outside help but that's obviously a lie too obvious whoever uses the hampers and whoever donates to the hampers it's anonymous for privacy reasons I mean I'm sure soldiers who did donate did feel satisfied by the act of doing charity but the newsletter was clear this wasn't about team spirit it was about helping the needy on the base the military brass who answered to Harjit Sajjan the liberal defense minister and he answers to Justin Trudeau they simply would not accept money from us no matter what we offered to do in a compromise their excuses kept changing because the money was from us we're conservative worse than that we criticized Trudeau I mean Trudeau's right-hand man Gerald Butz literally calls us Nazis because we made fun of his whole people kind comments see my point here they hate us more than they love the troops and of course you knew that Trudeau personally apologized to Omar Khadr this soldier murdering terrorists and gave him 10.5 million tax dollars that ten point five million dollars could have paid for Christmas hampers and Easter hampers and groceries for under stress military families across the whole family whole country for a year Petrino has no money for them in fact he's cutting benefits cutting danger Paik cutting health benefits while paying out terrorists tens of millions of dollars that's bad enough but now he is literally stopping us from filling the gap I don't know if is that he's embarrassed that we're doing what he won't do or if he just hates us or what but they blocked us so we felt well it's not our money it's some my money it's our donors money and it was for the military in specific the campaign was literally called feed our troops not feed some you know random person so we weren't just gonna give it any old food bank which are basically these days how long rosary stores for Justin Trudeau's Syrian migrants again he treats them better than he treats our own soldiers doesn't he so we did our research and the military charity called Canada company looked promising it had a solid rating on something called charity intelligence that's a website that ranks the accountability and transparency of different charities and how much they spent on over it so it looked like they do good work whether it's scholarships for children whose parents fell in combat or summer camp for kids whose parents are serving overseas or even just helping veterans get jobs and they're not too big a charity their annual budget is about two million bucks so our $15,000 it's going to be meaningful to them but it would have been meaningful on CFB Borden - until the Liberals rejected it so we made sure Canada company was okay with our donation before offering it to the no point in going through that whole rigmarole again so we reached out to them and we told them about the whole CFB Borden fiasco and we told them that the CFP rejected our money for political reasons and Canada come-to said no problem they'd be happy to take the cheque in fact their interim executive director offered to take us out for a nice lunch we said no that's not necessary save all the money for the veterans we'll just pop by just to give you the cheque and then we'll video that quick meeting to send it to our donors so they will know that we actually managed to keep our promise and and give the money to veterans so so the executive director said sure and we were speaking with this guy here he's a great guy from Ottawa named Paul Hindu and look at that he used to be a realtor and last year he won can you believe it he won a twenty-two million dollar lottery I mean it's unbelievable and listen to what he said when he wanted this guy's a great guy he said I want to be wise and thoughtful with this money and continue to give back to Canada which has been phenomenally generous to me and my family he said winning the lottery is freedom to make amazing choices for the betterment of my community my family and my friends by the way his family was a Christian Iraqi who came here I think his refugees to Montreal decades ago so he loves Canada's so much what an amazing guy I mean you and I might say oh yeah we would do the same thing if we won twenty two million dollars we'd give to charity yeah we'd say that but Paul Hendo actually has done that he's gone full out charitable full out philanthropist so he's the interim executive director of Canada company amongst other things he loves the military what a good egg I tell you we got along with him so well so David Menzies went to their office in Toronto with a check for more than 15 grand and you can see on the left there is the founder of Canada company named Blake Goldring I'm sure good guy too I just don't know him and and there's Paul Hendo there on the right anyways they had a seven-minute conversation I know that because we videotaped it and I watched the videotape because we were going to send an excerpt of that to our donors to show what we had done with the money sort of as proof yeah we actually came to the jetty I watched the whole seven minutes David asked them about Canada company handed them the cheque reminded our viewers what he was doing there the reason we were giving it to them rather than CFP board and Christmas hampers that was pretty much it it was seven minutes smiles all around handshakes the cheque mission accomplished David and our cameraman came back to the studio to record his final comments and we were got a clip I don't know maybe 90 seconds from that seven-minute ceremony to show our viewers I mean really just to prove we gave the money just so it was done thank goodness imagine having trouble giving $15,000 wait but literally as David was in the studio recording his wrap-up comments we got this email from Paul Hinda copy to a senior lawyer at a big law firm they can only be described as bizarre it was signed by Paul Hendo but it obviously wasn't written by him Paul Henne was a good egg a friendly guy a former realtor they're all friendly but he's more than friendly he's a genuinely good man who was dedicating his life and his newfound fortune to charity he was a guy who was so excited about our donation he invited us out for lunch he was so friendly so to go from mr. super friendly charity guy to Mister legal demand in the course of two hours it didn't make sense Paul said he would be returning the check on cash let me read the letter he said we are unable to accept the check presented today as we do not endorse or support political views of any organization pardon say what huh we're a media company we're not political candidates the money was from two hundred and twenty three individual donors I have no idea what each of their political stripes are I mean I'm guessing they're conservative but I really don't care it wasn't a political donation it is for a veteran's charity David did not ask Paul Hindu or the other guy for an endorsement and they did not give him one David only asked him to talk about themselves and they did the closest thing to a political moment was a few seconds when David explained you know why we were there in the first place why we were giving the money to Canada company into instead of CFP board which is true and it's true we're conservative in our outlook but what does that have to do with returning our cheque denying $15,000 - for example their camp for military kids or or scholarships so - orphan kids because they don't like our politics they're going to deny military orphans a scholarship because they don't like that were conservative I'm sorry I just don't believe that was Paul Hendo I look at this line in the letter we are returning your check and ask that you refrain from posting the video on your website and return the tape to us pardon me they're demanding that we destroy the video showing that we even met with them and send it back to them I can guarantee that insane authoritarian bullying move was not from Paul Hinda perhaps the nicest man in Canada that it wasn't it's not who he is David's conversation with him was pretty much identical to what we said to him right before the meeting when we were there in the minute setting up our camera and what we said to him on the phone before that a normal human being does not even think of demanding the videotape be destroyed that's a Liberal Party move and also weirdly the demand letter signed but obviously not written by Paul him though was copied to a lawyer at a major law firm statements what was it was just some weird attempt to intimidate us or something crazy well first of all we were only going to show about 90 seconds of that videotape meeting just to show the check being handed over but because they demand we don't show it we're gonna put the whole seven minute exchange on the Internet's gonna be on this page somewhere else just so you could see it it's not that interesting actually and then you can see both Paul Hindu and Blake Golding do not object in any way to anything David says and by the way David really doesn't say anything of note other than here's the money but that's all detail the essence of the story is this this is the second time that a hidden hand has come in to swat away money destined for our troops in need or our veterans in need I am not sure if this is designed to hurt us here at the rebel I don't know how it does I mean it's not our money it's our donors money even if it were our money I'm not sure how not taking our money would hurt us that that just doesn't make a lot of sense to me doesn't make sense in terms of the mandate of this charity called Canada company they're supposed to be a charity not a political values test checking to make sure you attest to have the right views on Justin Trudeau before the hell that money go through to the kids that is weird it's like that summer jobs attestation to get the summer jobs grant but in this case it's liberals punishing the children of soldiers I know Paul Hinda didn't do this who knows maybe it was Blake golden he gives about $1,000 a year to the federal Liberal Party just in the past few years he's given them about ten thousand dollars so he is a major liberal donor maybe he did this like I say that letter was definitely not written by Paul Hinda even though it was signed by him I called Paul Henne on the phone I got his voicemail I left him a detailed message and he wrote a few times to him by email and he wrote back to me a couple times I said I'm happy to make sure we emphasize that Canada company is nonpartisan and non-political happy to emphasize that whatever David Menzies own views are they're just his views I think that's pretty obvious to all our viewers but I offered to guarantee that to Paul Hinda that I would take extra special care to make sure Canada company was not embarrassed at all that we did not imply or claim that they supported our politics we weren't gonna do that of course but I guaranteed it to him personally in a voice mail and then we had an email exchange before times in other words I met his one alleged objection but he still wouldn't budge so I if I took care of his one official objection he was worried that we would somehow paint it like he was endorsing our political views which it was crazy to begin with but I promised him he wouldn't I took care of his wonderful objection if I did that and he still wouldn't take the money then that obviously wasn't his real concern was it again this isn't on Paul Hendo it's on someone else may be liberal super donor Blake Golding I don't know maybe it's Canadian Forces brass again I bet they were pretty excited over there Canada company $15,000 check just walking in off the street they probably mentioned it to someone political in the Canadian Forces since Canada company works quite closely with the PR brass and the Canadian Forces I bet that's when it hit the fan the rebel you took money from the rebel Paul don't you know we refuse to take their money at CFB Borden don't you know they're conservative don't you know that the Prime Minister's office really really hates them Paul Pope give the money back well on what basis that Menzies seems like a nice guy well well well tell them they're too political tell them we can't have their politics Paul well isn't isn't that making us the political ones by refusing money from conservatives no Paul see it's not discrimination when we liberals do it trust me it worked for the summer jobs grant Liberals can give donations to the veterans limos can do it not that they would they're more than giving money to Omar Carter but but if a liberal ever wants to donate money to a veteran or for a liberal media company ever erases money from their viewers for a veteran we'll take that money Paul sure but not these really gross conservatives okay but make sure you get the videotape back Paul if they post that video Jerell bots will see it and scream at me again okay harjeet will do it look we're going to give this from the soldiers of veterans we are just going to 223 of our donors expect it if we have to literally go and have the money to the soldiers we will do it you know David Menzies will do that right I mean you know he will it's just a shame that a charity like Canada company run by such a good egg like Paul Hendo has been politically corrupted by liberals who hate us more than they love the troops David set up a petition called call off your dogs calm it's a petition to sell siddell Harjit Sajjan the defense minister to stop blocking money for veterans and their families bad enough the Trudeau is starving them of cash it's outrageous that he's blocking private charity that's coming in to fill the void if you haven't yet sign up please do that's call off your dogs calm David will deliver that to our cheats to John's office next month that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I
