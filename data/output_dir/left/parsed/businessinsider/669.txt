I'm Danielle home I'm the chef and
co-owner of Eleven Madison Park the
Nomad and make nice I really try to get
some exercise in in the morning maybe go
for a run in the park or if I cry don't
go through yoga class or something but
just to kind of be in tune with myself
because it's very physical what we do
we're on our feet all day long and I
think the help is very important to me
and then maybe have a little breakfast
but then the day is pretty full on my
favorite breakfast is probably a
scrambled eggs with ham and cheese and
and some bagels and maybe some smashed
avocado and maybe some butters and jam
and some cheese yeah that's probably
what I love quite a feat
