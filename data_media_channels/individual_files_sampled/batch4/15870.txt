hi everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel hypocrisy kinda seems like the universal theme within Hollywood these days now obviously there are good people within most any industry maybe not the drug industry but it's not really the good people who make headlines so now we've got Quentin Tarantino being called out by Kill Bill actress uma Thurman in an article written for the New York Times and in the piece she details an experience on the set of their movie in which Quentin Tarantino forced her to perform an extreme driving stunt herself that she didn't feel comfortable doing rather than using you know a stunt double who would have been much more competent and experienced in executing this type of stunt so she goes on to detail that because of a seat issue in the car the car drifted off the road and smashed into a palm tree nearby now she alleges that since then she has suffered neck and knee injuries that still bother her to this day but she noted that while she doesn't really feel like there was any malicious intent behind it she found the situation to be quote negligent to the point of criminality and there are other problems obviously specifically the fact that Quentin Tarantino knew about Harvey Weinstein's behavior within Hollywood as recently as two days ago Judd Apatow who has his own set of issues within Hollywood blasted Tarantino on Twitter saying that Tarantino ignored Daryl Hannah's complaints when she was harassed by Harvey Weinstein and he claims that they kicked her off of the press tour and that no one helped Daryl Hannah and her pursuit of justice when she made complaints and Darren Liana's accusations date all the way back to the days of pre Kill Bill at Cannes Film Festival where Weinstein allegedly banging on her hotel room door leaving her no option but to escape via a back entrance and yet another encounter ensued after that when Weinstein rushed into her hotel room raging like a bull during the Kill Bill Vol to premiere in Rome now why why would Tarantino stay silent is there any acceptable reason to not report this type of abuse anything at all no of course there isn't but his excuse is even more gag-worthy than you can imagine that he wanted to keep making movies with Weinstein that's it so because he wanted to keep making movies he allowed possibly dozens of women to be harassed and assaulted by this man the irony is as thick as you would want your door to be between you and this man if you're a woman if you're a man or specifically my dad you'd probably prefer that nothing obstruct your path in destroying someone like this and tearing him to pieces and and yet beyond all of this I wonder if Tarantino will be ostracized from Hollywood the way that Harvey Weinstein seems to have been and I say scene because Hollywood tends to be very forgiving of each other Roman Polanski jay-z etc so who knows if that will actually stick you know will he ever be able to work in Hollywood again or will he be like another I didn't do it myself but I knew about it celebrity like Tonya Harding and have a movie made about him hmm so if Hollywood really wants to be the arbiter of morality and the administers of justice they might want to check their own compasses it seems like their moral compasses are a little faulty until it's financially and professionally expedient to get them back in working condition thanks for watching I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from me and my pals here at the rebel make sure you subscribe to our premium content at www.fortuigence.com you
