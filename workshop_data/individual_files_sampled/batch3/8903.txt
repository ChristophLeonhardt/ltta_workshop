WE ARE BACK WITH A FOX NEWS ALERT. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN BOTH IN SINGAPORE PREPPING FOR THE HIGH STAKES MOMENT. THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR NORTH KOREA TO GIVE UP THEIR NUKES. HERE WITH US IS JOE LIEBERMAN. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. GREAT, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU. WE HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT WALK DOWN THE STEPS IN SINGAPORE. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS? I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT. YOU CAN'T JUMP TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT REACHING A MEANINGFUL AGREEMENT. WE HAVE THE TWO HEADS OF STATE. WE ARE THE MUCH MORE POWERFUL COUNTRY. NEVER HAS THE PRESIDENT AND THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA MET. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BRING PEACE TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA. THE REST IS UP TO THESE TWO MEN. SENATOR, YOU MENTIONED IT MAY BE DIFFERENT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE FROM THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE ALSO AT A POINT WHEN NORTH KOREA HAS 30 TO 60 NUKES. THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT'S ABOUT TO BEGIN THAT COULD LEAD TO DENUCLEARIZE EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. IT COULD LEAD TO THAT. THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION NEGOTIATIONED AN AGREEMENT WITH KIM'S FATHER. WE SET UP A BIG ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THE SUNSHINE THE SOUSHINE THE SOUTHINE THE SOUTH KE THE SOUTH KOREAS WERE INVOLVED. BASICALLY THEY TOOK THE MONEY AND WALKED AWAY FROM THE AGREEMENT. THIS MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR A LOT OF REASONS. THIS IS A NEW GENERATION. KIM JONG-UN IS IN CHARGE. HE HAS RAPIDLY DEVELOPED THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAMS. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS AN UNCONVENTIONAL AMERICAN LEADER. HE ALSO SET KIM JONG-UN OFF A BIT AND MADE HIM WONDER IF A DEAL IS POSSIBLE. OUR DEMANDS, OUR PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THIS. PERMANENT, IRREVERSIBLE. ANY TIME ANYWHERE INSPECTION PROGRAM. THAT'S ASKING A LOT OF A LEADER OF A CLOSED SOCIETY. WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GIVE HIM A LOT. SENATOR, YOU HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS, YOU PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN THE IRAN DEAL. IF YOU WERE WITH THE PRESIDENT STANDING OUTSIDE THE DOOR WITH KIM JONG-UN. WHAT ADVISE WOULD YOU GIVE HIM. WHAT PITFALLS WOULD YOU SAY AVOID? RIGHT. IRONICALLY, GOING BACK TO THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REMEMBER ALL OF THE CRITICISMS YOU MADE OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE RELEVANT HERE. YOU DON'T WANT THE AGREEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA MORE THAN THE NORTH KOREANS DID. IT LOOKED LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID. DON'T SETTLE FOR A HALFWAY MEASURE, OKAY, WE'LL STOP IT BUT THEN TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL START IT AGAIN. DON'T COMPROMISE ON AN INSPECTION LIKE IRAN. ALSO FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS. THIS IS BIG AND IMPORTANT TO THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND TO THE UNITED STATES. WE THINK THE NORTH KOREANS CAN REACH ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH ONE OF THEIR MISSILES. IN THE END, IT COMES DOWN TO THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THESE TWO MEN ESTABLISH WITH ONE ANOTHER. I DON'T EXPECT A BIG BREAK THROUGH TODAY, BUT IF THEY GET SOME PERSONAL TRUST BETWEEN THEM 6789 TALK ABOUT THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND KIM TELLS PRESIDENT TRUMP I'M OPEN TO THE PERMANENT DENUCLEARIZE THAT MAY MEAN WE MIGHT SAY WE WON'T PUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN SOUTH KOREA. THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GO. WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.
