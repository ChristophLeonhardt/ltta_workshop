THAT DEATH COUNT RISE.
IT'S BEEN A BIG DAY HERE WITH
THE OPENING OF THE EMBASSY.
NEIL?
>> Neil: THANKS VERY MUCH,
BENJAMIN.
OIL PRICES MOVING UP ON
CONCERNSES THAT THERE'S ANGST
OVER THIS AND ON THE IRAN DEAL.
THE READ NOW FROM FLORIDA'S
ATTORNEY GENERAL, PAM BONDI.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?
OUTSIDE OF GUATEMALA AND
PARAGUAY, THERE WASN'T A CONGO
LINE OF COUNTRIES FOLLOWING SUIT
HERE?
>> IT SHOWS THAT WE'RE THE
STRONGEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,
NEIL.
OUR PRESIDENT DOES WHAT HE SAYS
HE'S GOING TO DO.
I THINK IT'S A STRONG NOT ONLY
SHOW OF STRENGTH BUT ALSO UNITY.
ISRAEL WAS OUR GREATEST ALLY IN
THE WORLD.
I'M SO PROUD OF WHAT HAPPENED
TODAY.
I'VE BEEN TO ISRAEL TWICE AS
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITOL OF
ISRAEL.
>> Neil: AS YOU KNOW WITH THESE
PALESTINIAN PROTESTS, THE FEARS
ARE THAT IT'S AGITATE AGO LOT OF
THE VIOLENCE.
ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT THE
PALESTINIANS LOOK FORWARD TO A
HOMELAND OF THEIR OWN.
THE KEY TO THAT WOULD BE MAKING
JERUSALEM ITS CAPITOL.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY NOW.
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE?
>> THE U.S. WAS IN THE FINAL
STAGES OF FINALIZING OUR PEACE
PLAN WITH ISRAEL AND PALESTINE
AND JARED KUSHNER.
HE'S AN AMAZING PERSON.
HE'S A GREAT NEGOTIATOR AS WELL
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
I FEEL THAT -- I THINK THIS
SHOWS STRENGTH.
IT SAYS THAT WE MEAN WHAT WE
SAY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALWAYS SAID,
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITOL AND IT
IS NOW FIRMLY THE CAPITOL.
AND WE DIDN'T WAIT YEARS, WE
DIDN'T SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS
TO DO IT.
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN AND IT HAPPENED.
SO HE'S NOT CONCEDING OTHER
THINGS.
WE'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS GOING
TO BE A NEGOTIATION.
NOTHING ELSE HAS BEEN FINALIZED
REGARDING BORDERS AND OTHER
ISSUES.
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP
FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL.
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN
IMPORTANT STEP, I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE NOTION THAT THERE'S
ANGST IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
IRAN GOING IT ALONE.
SO FAR PULLING AWAY FROM THE
AGREEMENT, DO YOU WORRY THAT
WHATEVER OUR CAUSE AND WHETHER
IT'S JUST OR NOT, THE FACT THAT
WE'RE LARGELY ALONE COULD BE A
PROBLEM?
>> NO, AGAIN, WE'RE ALONE BUT
WE'RE BRAVE.
THAT SHOWS STRENGTH.
PULLING OUT OF THE JCPOA WAS
PROBABLY ONE OF THE SMARTEST
THINGS WE COULD DO.
IRAN HAS LIED TO US FOR YEARS
ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THERE WERE NO INSPECTIONS GOING
ON.
THAT HAS TO STOP.
THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT
TRUMP, KNOWS HOW TO HIT THEM.
WE SAW THAT WITH CHINA.
HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO, HOW TO HIT
THEM WITH TRADE, THE FINANCIAL
MARKET.
THE ECONOMY.
EVERYTHING HE CAN DO TO IMPACT
THEM TO STOP MAKING THESE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND PROVIDING
TOOLS TO HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH.
