about to go on a cable car to the top of
the mountain but apparently this is the
view at the top right now
so this is part of the Tatra mountain
range and apparently there's some pretty
awesome animals here as bears wolves
Lynx's which the big cats and then
there's marmots and mountain goats so

think the Bears in wolves are pretty um
hard to spot and the Lynx is I love a
wildlife
we have stops by a mountain stream

snow run up we are heading to one of the
mountain huts to hopefully get a coffee

like 20 minutes yeah there's some big
rocks in the path say we need to be
careful this is so beautiful here
