tell me Ontario's green energy plan sure looks like a whiz-bang winning strategy assuming you're a a purchaser of energy in such jurisdictions as oh I don't know New York and Michigan Lauren how did Ontario ever end up in such an embarrassing mess in the first place because they believed the hype from environmentalists that you could replace coal you could replace natural gas with wind solar bug Bart burps you know animal flatulence whatever it was that that they considered green energy and you would not cost yourself any extra money and you would create all of these tens of thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands of green jobs that you would all of a sudden all of us stopped working at coal-fired power plants and and other carbon intensive industries and we become rich with our man buns and our poor over coffee okay it was it was the belief that this could be done painlessly quickly and probably with even more economic growth than would have been impossible under the old fossil fuel method and just because I give you one very good example you've been been chatting a little bit about about the extra amount that was added for some green energy costing a billion or more a year to subsidize power to the to the northern tier States in the United States there's another very very good example you had a coal-fired power plant in Thunder Bay that was converted to burning wood chips makes some sense is a lot of lumbering up there and in Thunder Bay there's some wood processing there's probably a fair number of chips around and make some sense to if you're gonna close down a coal-fired power plant you would you'd burn chips but the chips that need that are needed for the plant that was put in can only be obtained from Norway but all of the chips that are up there in Northern Ontario already can't be burned in this incinerator they have to be shipped in from Norway and so instead of costing somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 or $60 a kilowatt hour which is what the the the coal was costing Ontario consumers and taxpayers are now paying close to fifteen hundred dollars a kilowatt hour for Norwegian bark that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra lavance show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
