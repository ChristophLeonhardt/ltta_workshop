1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:02,724
US.

2
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:04,793
>> Tucker: THANK YOU FOR THAT,

3
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:06,728
I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON

4
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:07,029
THIS.

5
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:10,566
>> I ENJOY IT, IT'S ALWAYS FUN.

6
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,100
>> Tucker: MIKE PENN WAS FOR

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,770
MANY YEARS ONE OF THE HIGHEST

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,340
ADVISORS TO HILLARY CLINTON.

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,175
MARK, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

10
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:21,710
>> Mark: THANK YOU.

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,744
>> Tucker: YOU WROTE AN

12
00:00:22,744 --> 00:00:24,513
AMAZING PIECE THE OTHER DAY AND

13
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:27,616
THE HILL, TITLED SOMETHING LIKE,

14
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,651
QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR ROBERT

15
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:33,822
MUELLER.

16
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:34,523
TELL US SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

17
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:34,957
THAT YOU HAVE.

18
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:36,758
>> Mark: REMEMBER I SPENT A

19
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:37,226
YEAR WORKING FOR

20
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:37,926
PRESIDENT CLINTON AGAINST KEN

21
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:43,131
STARR AND THAT.

22
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,433
I FOUND THAT WAS CHILD'S PLAY

23
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:46,535
COMPARED TO WHAT'S GOING ON

24
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:46,835
HERE.

25
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,136
I FOUND MUELLER HAS SOME

26
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:49,338
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

27
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:50,272
PRESIDENT WAS THINKING WHEN HE

28
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,140
FIRED CALL ME, BUT I CERTAINLY

29
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,409
HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE WAS

30
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,745
THINKING WHEN HE FIRST WENT TO

31
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,614
APPLY FOR THE FBI JOB IN THE

32
00:00:58,614 --> 00:00:59,948
FIRST PLACE WITH ROSENSTEIN, AND

33
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:02,751
THEN TURNS AROUND THE NEXT DAY.

34
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,686
WHEN HE PUT THAT TEAM TOGETHER,

35
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:05,354
AND THERE WASN'T A SINGLE

36
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:07,456
TRUMPED OWNER, WHAT WAS HE

37
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:09,358
THINKING THEN?

38
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,293
WHEN HE LOOKED AT THESE DOSSIERS

39
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:13,362
AND DISCOVERED THERE WAS NO

40
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:14,763
FOUNDATION THERE, HOW DID HE

41
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:16,231
DEAL WITH THAT, AND HOW DOES HE

42
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:20,836
JUSTIFY THESE KINDS OF REALLY

43
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:23,538
STORMTROOPER TACTICS, WHICH IS

44
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:24,306
PERHAPS NOT AN EXAGGERATION WHEN

45
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:30,946
YOU GO GUNS DRAWN AND POLITICAL

46
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:31,947
ENACTMENTS.

47
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:33,382
WHILE HE WANTS TO QUESTION THE

48
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:34,149
PRESIDENT, IT SEEMS THAT NO ONE

49
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:39,521
COULD REALLY QUESTION EITHER

50
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:40,622
MUELLER OR CALL ME OR

51
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:44,893
ROSENSTEIN, WHICH IS PRECISELY

52
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:45,294
THE PROBLEM.

53
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:46,995
>> I HATE TO ADMIT IT SINCE I

54
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,764
SUPPORTED THE KEN STARR

55
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:49,364
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL

56
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:50,932
INVESTIGATION, AND I LOOK BACK

57
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:52,067
AND SHAME BECAUSE OF THAT.

58
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,569
BUT THAT WAS THE CASE THE

59
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:56,138
CLINTON PEOPLE MADE AT THE TIME,

60
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:58,373
THERE IS NO OVERSIGHT THERE.

61
00:01:58,373 --> 00:01:59,474
IN YOUR PIECE YOU MADE REFERENCE

62
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:01,243
TO HIS BEHAVIOR IN BOSTON WHEN

63
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:03,879
HE WORKED THERE.

64
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,746
BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THAT IF YOU

65
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:08,750
WOULD, I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY

66
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,351
INTERESTING.

67
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,752
>> Mark: REALLY THE QUESTION,

68
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:12,688
AND I THINK PROFESSOR DERSHOWITZ

69
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:14,890
HAS BEEN OUT ON THIS THING, BUT

70
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,892
IN THAT CASE THERE WERE FOUR

71
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:18,994
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN JAIL DUE TO

72
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:19,928
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.

73
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:24,800
AND HE WAS HEAD OF THE OFFICE.

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,436
AND, YOU DON'T REALLY FIND HIM

75
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:28,937
IN THE LEGAL CASES BUT HE WAITED

76
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:30,572
UNTIL THE COURTS OVERTURNED

77
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:31,740
THINGS TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE.

78
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,742
SO WHAT WAS HE THINKING WHEN

79
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:34,976
THAT WAS HAPPENING?

80
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:36,945
HOW DID HE PERMIT THAT, HOW DID

81
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:39,214
HE PERMIT THOSE KIND OF GROSS

82
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:41,149
ABUSES, AND HOW DOES HE THEN

83
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,317
SUPERVISE AN INVESTIGATION NOW

84
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,486
THAT SEEMS TO BE FILLED WITH

85
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:50,692
THEM.

86
00:02:50,692 --> 00:00:00,000
>>  >> Tucker: WILL THANKS FOR
