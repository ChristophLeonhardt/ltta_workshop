a new report has found that more than 30,000 young children in the UK between the ages 10 and 15 now claim to be a member of a gang gang violence is sweeping across the UK it's not just London although the capital city does seem to be taking the brunt of it but this new research which shows that 30,000 kids between the ages of 10 and 15 claimed to be a member of a gang is really concerning and what's even more interesting is that senior police have told the Times that the the violence amongst children is completely out of control so this is what the Times reported in the first part of a series investigating Britain's lost children ms Longfield who is an Longfield the children's commissioner said that the pursuit of young people by drug dealers was a systemic and well-rehearsed business model now this is basically what happened in Rotherham is what happens which how grooming gangs all over the country are grooming children and it's not just for rape they're using them as drug mules that they're taking them out on the streets using them as ways to bypass the police and that's that and there was a tragic story over the weekend actually a 15 year old boy from Romford became the 77th person murdered in London this year and the 50th victim of a fatal stabbing in London The Telegraph reported on this story and they said a 15 year old school boy has been stabbed to death after a large-scale fight broke out at a birthday party in East London police were called to a community centre in Romford just after 9:00 p.m. on Saturday evening after trouble flared when around 200 gate crashes were turned away from the event and began causing trouble officers arriving at the scene were greeted by group of youths battling one another and causing damage to surrounding property as police intervened they discovered a teenager collapsed on the ground suffering from knife wounds and amidst all this insanity being ignored by Sadiq Khan a Tory MP has stepped in and backed a scheme that's being trialed in North London and The Guardian reports Victoria Atkins her Home Office minister back to scheme being trialed in North London that threatens whole families in council homes with eviction and offers leniency to gang members in some low-level cases such as possession of cannabis in a newspaper interview published on Friday she backed the schemes the government had changed the law to enable it to happen and claiming it would force people involved in violent crimes to understand the consequences of their actions and you know what I am glad to see some action being taken by somebody the government's changed the law to allow this kind of trial to happen and yeah I mean there's a point there making people understand the consequences of their actions but I want to see real action being taken and this is a star and I'm fine with it in principle but I wonder if maybe it just would embolden gangs actually you know move the gangs out onto the street move gangs and you know create homeless gang members and homeless families of gang members and that just breeds even more anger amongst the gangs I mean they're gonna have to go somewhere I mean as I say I'm fine with it in principle there needs to be some kind of reaction there needs to be a consequence to the actions of these people but I'm not entirely convinced that throwing them out on the streets is actually going to really help all that much the proposal backed by Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins which would see criminal gang members evicted from their council homes and thrown into the street is a good start but it's simply not good enough I mean with 30,000 young people now claiming to be members of a gang between the ages of 10 and 15 we need to create a society worth living in if we want to change this we need to change society from the ground up and it needs to be a society where children have opportunities where children are saved and where children aren't dragged into petty disagreements and conflicts on the street the fact remains if we didn't have ghettos we wouldn't have gangs and that's a fact instead of simply evicting criminal gangsters I want to see the police tracking them down and throwing them in jail I think children should see that there are consequences to criminal actions I want more police on the streets and I also want to see foreign criminal gang members kicked out of the country entirely if we tackle the source of the problem here if we D ghettoize our inner cities and if we create a space a country where people want to raise happy healthy families then then and only then can we go back to a time when our streets were safe you
