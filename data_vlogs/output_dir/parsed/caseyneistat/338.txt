becomes the wave Roy's have this plan
for us to race paddleboards across the
East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan
and then we'll go paddleboarding you
know you already went for like a
two-hour run this morning that runs one
hour it's hot humid I'm gonna turn
around and run back now
here's the deal we're gonna do all
Candice's things first then Roy and I
are gonna go on our paddleboard in the
East River mission
check out this shirt I'm getting
perfectly you know this guy's this
paddleboarding across the East River is
Roy's idea we haven't really fleshed out
any of the details we also are a little
vague on the legalities of
paddleboarding in the East River but I
think it's totally legit based on top
one so yeah this is the river gonna
cross
let's shop in windy there's a lot of
boats down there
so if that's one board and this is the
other one it's inflatable yeah I
borrowed some shorts from Roy's cousin
check these out
USA baby let me to pose it seems like a
really long board to put on the roof of
this car he puts it on that smart car is
that your electric smoke box
what if we don't have life jackets wait
if they'll probably you know if they see
you they're gonna come up to you they
approached me before without in the bay
in Long Beach and they're like yo you
can get a ticket to get out of the water
surf shop surf shop surf shop
it's a much easier place in Malibu I
don't care in the world the best surfers
are they are Kelly Slater it was
Chanukah weeks later they've all said it
was really dangerous so if that was you
guys I would say out of the East River
to the Hudson I shouldn't do that you
know the hug thing all right change of
plans we're gonna thank you thank you
change of plans we're gonna go to the
Hudson so we're gonna go check out the
water and then I think that's it I think
we're gonna we don't have life jacket
and I can see the current from here it
just looks like absolute madness insane
current seems a little a little rough
what do you think look it I know how to
judge the water man I'm looking at this
right over here and it's like intense
currents they're going in and out
there's a lot of wind on it too like if
you look right over here like I would
say just hang out in this little pond
right here you go into here this is the
death song it's gonna be a fight it's
gonna be a big fight
all right this is it we're paddling out
really final thoughts by daven leaving
the camera with you believe in t-shirts
I look so confident we're not going in
have fun guys
we got trouble coming
those are the bad boys right there we've
been out here for like three minutes
NYPD is already visiting Edit right
forum this looks like a short paddle
looks like a showdown right
are you good we got clearance
traffic
here comes the wave yeah I'm not
thinking across over think so
I'm scared
I know
how do we get the board's over this
fence well they're going out of the
water
yeah I could see them taking the boys
out of the water
no they're getting out onto the land the
trouble NYPD Harbor Patrol is great
but we don't have life jackets which is
not okay
really kept asking them to give us a
ride back which is bold right bull
the cops are super super cool and it
turns out work break any laws we were
just supposed to have on life jackets
but both the NYPD in the end why ft the
fire department because they thought we
were doing something wrong someone
called them a drowning yeah so we
apologized
yeah to to everyone for causing such a
stir that's good right there someone's
anybody get the wrong idea and anybody
else tries it make sure you wear a life
jacket
okay let's go home now go thank you
dude good to see you bye guys how you
doing so I'm just going over to
Manhattan
look that's we have to contend with
there's a construction site floating by
