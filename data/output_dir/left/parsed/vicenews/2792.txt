For sixty years, Crimea, a strategically important
peninsula in the Black Sea, has been a part of Ukraine.
After the Pro-European Revolution
toppled President Yanukovich in February,
the majority ethnic Russian population, with the
help of Russian soldiers, took control of the region.
An illegal referendum on whether to
join Russia or not was held shortly after,
and the next day, Russia annexed the peninsula
in a move widely condemned by the international
community.
On May the 9th, Russia and Ukraine celebrate Victory Day, which commemorates
the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War 2.
This year with Russia President, Valdimir Putin making an appearance
and Russia power and pageantry on shown,
the parade in Sevastopol acted as transparent in symbolic show of force.
That new reality for some means that having to hide their identity when talking about their
opposition to Russia's annexation of Crimea.
With a number of Pro-Ukrainians having been beaten, kidnapped and even been killed,
the fear of speaking openly is very real.
With Crimea now coming under Russian control,
people who wishes to remain have to apply for Russian passport
but the infamous Russian bureaucracy is not making it easy.
With a bleak economic future, the outlook for Crimea's youth,
is far from certain.
While there was protest and support for the revolution in Crimea, Pro-Ukranian activists who oppose
Russia's annexation have been violently targeted by the new Crimea authority.
