00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,075
Hey guys! I'm Teagan I'm Sam and we are the Rybka twins. Welcome back to our channel.

5
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:33,205
Hold on, hold on I'm Sam and I'm Teagan and we are the Rybka twins.

6
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,775
Wait I'm really confused. What's going on here?

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,280
TEAGAN! SAM!

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,735
Today guys we are doing a yoga challenge with the Johnson twins.

9
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:44,575
I'm Tiarna. And I'm Lindsey.

10
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,705
Welcome guys! Welcome!

11
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:49,805
So we thought we'd change it up a little bit; I think it's the second time that Sam and

12
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:52,925
I are going against each other in the yoga challenge

13
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:55,580
So I with Tiarna today and Sam's with Lindsey.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,340
But before we get on the video guys make sure to subscribe, if you haven't already

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,820
And give it a big thumbs up, if you like it!

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,660
And don't forget to click that gray bell next to the subscribe button so you guys are notified every time we post a video.

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,300
And we'll also be announcing fan of the week and Instagram shoutout at the end of the video

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,820
Probably by now you know how the yoga challenge works, but just in case

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,320
We have a series of poses that we haven't seen yet

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,940
The first pair to get into the pose and hold it for 3 seconds wins each round.

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,480
And the pair with the most points at the end obviously wins the yoga challenge

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
Alright, first pose

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,500

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,900

30
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,620

40
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,980
So that one was much harder than expected

41
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,340
I think we all thought we'd like, get up there great.

42
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,560
So you guys are still one up. Alright next pose.

43

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,040
