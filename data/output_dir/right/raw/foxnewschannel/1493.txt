1
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:08,109
>> Laura: PRESIDENT TRUMP

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,678
AND JAMES COMEY ACCUSING EACH

3
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:11,213
OTHER OF LYING OVER "SPYGATE."

4
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:12,448
THAT IS WHAT TRUMP CALLED

5
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:13,849
REPORTS THAT THE F.B.I. HAD AN

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,117
INFORMANT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL

7
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:15,751
CAMPAIGN.

8
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:17,319
COMEY TWEETED TODAY ATTACKS ON

9
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,821
THE F.B.I. AND LYING ABOUT

10
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,589
WORK WILL DO LASTING DAMAGE TO

11
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:21,056
OUR COUNTRY.

12
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,391
TRUMP RESPONDED BY SUGGESTING

13
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:24,560
THAT COMEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,130
THE UPCOMING I.G. REPORT.

15
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,465
>> IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE DID,

16
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:31,333
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE

17
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,470
LAWS, THE TREMENDOUS LIES --

18
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,871
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIES, THE

19
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,005
TREMENDOUS LIES, ALL THAT IS

20
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,373
GOING ON, JAMES COMEY HAS A

21
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:39,441
LOT OF PROBLEMS NOW.

22
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,442
>> Laura: AMONG THE PROBLEMS

23
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:41,410
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT FROM

24
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,078
THE DAILY CALLER THE RANK AND

25
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,279
FILE F.B.I. AGENTS WANT TO

26
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,547
TESTIFY TO CONGRESS THAT

27
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,850
POLITICS AND INCOMPETENCE AT

28
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,418
THE TOP ARE DESTROYING THE

29
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:50,018
BUREAU.

30
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:51,019
LET'S DISCUSS THAT WITH

31
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,187
SENATOR RON JOHNSON, CHAIRMAN

32
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:53,288
OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY

33
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:54,923
COMMITTEE WHO RECENTLY SENT A

34
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,492
LETTER TO F.B.I. DIRECTOR

35
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:57,259
CHRISTOPHER WRAY REQUESTING

36
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,427
INFORMATION ON COMEY'S

37
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,229
BRIEFING OF TRUMP ON THAT

38
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:01,530
INFAMOUS RUSSIA DOSSIER.

39
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,831
GREAT TO HAVE YOU IN THE

40
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:03,499
STUDIO.

41
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:04,132
>> HELLO, LAURA.

42
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,767
>> Laura: TELL US.

43
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:06,869
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

44
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,737
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT

45
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:10,572
THREADS IT'S HARD TO UNPACK.

46
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:11,940
TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.

47
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,343
>> THERE IS A LOT OF SMOKE.

48
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:15,477
WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE

49
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:16,178
BOTTOM OF THIS.

50
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,180
THIS IS LIKE 1,000-PIECE

51
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,114
JIGSAW PUZZLE.

52
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:20,482
MILLER PROBABLY HAS A FEW

53
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:23,752
HUNDRED PIECES.

54
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:24,753
I.IG HOROWITZ HAS A FEW LESS.

55
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:26,255
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER AND

56
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:27,589
HE CAN'T BRING IN WITNESSES

57
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:28,190
OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT.

58
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,859
THE PRESS HAS MORE PIECES THAN

59
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,895
THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

60
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:33,795
>> Laura: THEY'RE GETTING A

61
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:35,264
LOT OF LEAKS.

62
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:35,831
SELECTIVE LEAKS.

63
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,332
>> PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

64
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:39,234
WHAT ARE THOSE LEAKERS TRYING

65
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:39,902
TO ACCOMPLISH?

66
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:41,537
TRYING TO GET AHEAD BEFORE THE

67
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:43,772
PUBLIC HAS THE TRUTH.

68
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:46,241
THIS ENTIRE INVESTIGATION IS

69
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:46,608
BACKWARDS.

70
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:47,609
THIS IS A POLITICAL

71
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,043
INVESTIGATION.

72
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:49,378
I THINK CONGRESS OUGHT TO GET

73
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:51,280
THE INFORMATION FIRST.

74
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,948
WRITE THE REPORTS AND THEN IF

75
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:54,383
WE SEE THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

76
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:55,851
REFER IT TO THE JUSTICE

77
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,620
DEPARTMENT OR A SPECIAL

78
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,555
COUNSEL.

79
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:00,422
THE PROBLEM IS CRIMINAL

80
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,424
INVESTIGATIONS MAKES IT

81
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:03,592
DIFFICULT FOR CONGRESS TO GET

82
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:04,860
ANY INFORMATION WHATSOEVER.

83
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,727
WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION.

84
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,529
I'M TRYING TO LAY IT OUT IN

85
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:07,896
TIMELINES.

86
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:08,931
CHUCK GRASSLEY TALKING ABOUT

87
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:13,235
THE RECENT TWEET THAT IS

88
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:13,769
GETTING PROMINENCE.

89
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,137
ON AUGUST 5, THE WHITE HOUSE

90
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:16,638
IS RUNNING THIS.

91
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:17,906
COMBINE THIS WITH THE TWEET WE

92
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:19,541
GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR

93
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,475
PUBLISHING IN ONE OF OUR

94
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,009
REPORTS

95
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:21,376
>> Laura.

96
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,011
PUT IT UP SO PEOPLE CAN SEE

97
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:23,445
IT.

98
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:25,080
A QUOTE FROM GRASSLEY TO

99
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,883
ROSENSTEIN TODAY IN A LETTER

100
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:30,285
AND SAID AS ONE EXAMPLE OF THE

101
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:32,754
TEXT FROM LISA PAIGE AND PETER

102
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:33,922
STROZK THEY WANT ALL THE

103
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:34,223
TEXTS.

104
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:35,657
ONE EXAMPLE AN OFFICIAL'S NAME

105
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,759
WAS REDACTED IN REFERENCE TO A

106
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,829
TEXT ABOUT THE OBAMA WHITE

107
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,730
HOUSE RUNNING AN

108
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,231
INVESTIGATION.

109
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:45,634
ALTHOUGH IT'S UNCLEAR WHO THIS

110
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,935
INVESTIGATION THEY WERE

111
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:47,302
REFERRING.

112
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:48,670
GOING BACK TO MY QUESTION IN

113
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,038
THE ANGLE, WHO KNEW ABOUT

114
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:50,472
THIS?

115
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:52,641
>> WE HAVE SO MANY REDACTIONS

116
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:53,742
WE CAN'T PUT PIECES TOGETHER.

117
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:55,010
THERE IS A LOT OF SMOKE.

118
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,378
IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THE

119
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,080
TWEET WE PUBLISHED ID JUST GOT

120
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,315
BASHED FOR IN THE PRESS A

121
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:00,983
MONTH LATER.

122
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,084
SEPTEMBER 2.

123
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:03,385
POTUS WANTS -- THIS IS FROM

124
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:08,290
PAIGE TO STRONG -- PAGE TO

125
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:08,657
STROZK.

126
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:09,491
POTUS WANTS TO KNOW EVERYTHING

127
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:09,958
WE ARE DOING.

128
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,160
THIS IS AFTER THEY CLOSED UP,

129
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,828
EXONERATED HILLARY CLINTON.

130
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,863
THAT IS WHAT WE WILL GET AN

131
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:15,831
I.G. REPORT ON.

132
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:17,332
HOROWITZ DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.

133
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:18,834
McCABE GOT HIM, CAUGHT HIM

134
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:21,870
LYING AND LAID OUT 32 PAGES

135
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,338
EXACTLY WHY THE DEPUTY AND THE

136
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:24,606
ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I.

137
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,741
LIED TO THE F.B.I.

138
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:26,074
OKAY?

139
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,476
I MEAN, IF ANYBODY OUGHT TO

140
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:29,077
KNOW THAT IS A CRIME, THAT IS

141
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,445
THE MAN WHO SHOULD HAVE DONE

142
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:31,179
SO.

143
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:35,350
IT'S NO LONGER MARTYR

144
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,751
McCABE.

145
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,753
THESE TYPE OF THE TEXTS HERE

146
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:39,054
ARE UNBELIEVABLY REVEALING.

147
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:39,988
>> Laura: THE QUESTION I

148
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:45,060
ASKED IN MY OPENING ANGLE, WHO

149
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,495
BASICALLY KNEW HOW THIS WAS

150
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:47,663
GOING DOWN?

151
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:49,298
CARTER PAIGE IS THE REASON YOU

152
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:51,433
ARE OPENING UP A BIG

153
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,768
INVESTIGATION WHERE YOU END UP

154
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:54,336
PUTTING AN INFORMANT OUT

155
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:54,636
THERE?

156
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:56,838
AND THEN YOU ENUP SURVEILLING

157
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:57,939
THE TRUMP TOWER AND CUSHION

158
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,141
CUSHION AND THE GUYS TO GET

159
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,276
THE PHONE CALLS LISTENED TO?

160
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,844
THEN YOU HAVE A RUSSIAN

161
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:05,347
BILLIONAIRE VISITED BY THE

162
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:06,548
F.B.I.

163
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:08,050
IN SEPTEMBER OF 2016.

164
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,751
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET HIM TO

165
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,053
AGREE TO -- THIS IS A

166
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:11,887
COLLUSION THING GOING ON.

167
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,288
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

168
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:14,556
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR --

169
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:15,757
C'MON, HELP US WITH THE

170
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:16,757
COLLUSION STUFF.

171
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,892
EVEN THE RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE

172
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:20,128
WHO HATES PAUL MANAFORT, THE

173
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:23,498
OLLIE -- OLIGARCH SAYS I CAN'T

174
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:24,633
STAND HIM BUT THIS IS

175
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,233
RIDICULOUS.

176
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,336
>> IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH

177
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,403
IMAGINATION TO LOOK AT THIS

178
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:29,571
AND SAY THIS IS A SETUP.

179
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:30,872
THE WHITE HOUSE RUNNING THIS

180
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:31,740
AND POTUS WANTS TO KNOW

181
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,241
EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING.

182
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:35,243
THE HATS START PUTTING TWO AND

183
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:35,677
TWO TOGETHER.

184
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,512
WE MAYBE GOT 25 TO 50 PIECES

185
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:39,014
OUT OF THAT 1,000 PAGE --

186
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,682
>> Laura: ARE YOU GOOD AT

187
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:41,283
JIGSAW PUZZLES?

188
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,151
ARE YOU GOOD AT IT?

189
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,286
>> I GET FRUSTRATED.

190
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:45,687
RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR

191
