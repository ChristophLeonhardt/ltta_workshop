obviously a lot of Democrats not happy with the Senate bill a lot of the Senate Democrats have been on the warpath on this and they continue to be now that we have the actual details now that they can actually see what's in it as well first here we have Elizabeth Warren with incredibly uncompromising rhetoric Medicaid is the program in this country that provides health insurance to one in five Americans to 30 million kids to nearly two out of every three people in a nursing home these cuts are blood money people will die let's be very clear Senate Republicans are paying for tax cuts for the wealthy with American lives that's that's I want to hear that more so now that was good strong rhetoric that was strong uh very specific and like I said uncompromising we also have Bernie Sanders the essence of what this bill does is make massive cuts in health care programs for working families while giving outrageous tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and that is not what this nation is supposed to be about and it's not what the American people want people don't think that we should throw millions of people off of Medicaid substantially raise premiums for older workers defund Planned Parenthood while making the very richest people in this country even richer it's it's a pleasure to have at least two senators who speak frankly about things in the past uh we had Bernie Sanders and Akande and TV wouldn't even cover yeah and so now we've at least got some yeah progressives on our side in powers yes refresh we could show you more uh we'd be you know have time limits obviously becomea Harris has been tweeting non-stop about this and she's but she's been great uh Chuck Schumer he's technically saying the right thing talking about this is a wolf in sheep's clothing and all that but it just it's so easy what I like don't say no it's not a wolf in sheep's clothing it's a wolf okay it's going to kill people there's no sheep the Sheep laws health insurance and died of cancer okay it's a fucking wolf yeah I don't I miss the sheep's clothing what's there I think the wolf ate the sheep's clothes there is no part of the bill where you're like well on the other hand yeah exactly oh this is not bad yeah everything two parts on the other hand are only young and incredibly healthy pay a little bit less uh but the PM rarely yet terror until they get older and then they'll pay far more right or if they get sick right with the board of insurance yeah so every else pays more gets less coverage and of course all the other uh it part of it is that the the rich get these a massive tax cuts yeah look another thing we're gonna find out now is what is the state of the Republican Party because there was some comical uh in my opinion punditry on television as usual uh say well the House bill is incredibly draconian but the Senate is filled with moderate Republicans well look hey sheep's clothing where are you it is so well that we're gonna find out we're gonna find out so it might turn out that this isn't causal world block this thing they go nowhere they today yet because there's you need there's fifty two Republican senators so you need or you can only lose two of them yeah well Lisa Murkowski we're gonna find out if there are in fact three moderate Republicans left in the country I'm glad that you mentioned that the Senate is full D'Amato say I mention this on the show a couple days ago at one point I think you might have been on the panel we were covering the House bill and someone on the panel said why are we even wasting our time with this it's never gonna pass the House of course within 48 hours of pass house and then oh that was the other thing that we heard it was like you're wasting all your time on this House bill it's never gonna pass when I get to the Senate like life comes at you fast okay that's why we warned you about things like this because so many people are so effing complacent and there are a lot of people that even before the election before Donald Trump won certainly before his inauguration made a conscious decision that they are going to lie down on this and they don't care what Donald Trump does they don't care what the Republicans do their eyes are off two years four years a hundred years in the future and they are not going to be watching for this they mock the resistance they will provide no resistance okay this is happening it's happening every day and we're dealing with this now in a couple of months we got the tax bill and I guarantee there going to be people who are labeled as liberals in progress is saying it's never gonna pass like that it's not going to be that bad and then a couple of days are gonna pass and suddenly we're gonna be looking at a 66% cut to corporate taxes there are people were trying to pull the wool over your eyes some of them agree with you on a number of issues but they obviously do not have your best interests at heart this bill that could be passed with a couple of days is proof of that yeah let me lay down a marker now for you guys uh the House and the Senate will pass a gigantic humongous tax cut bill they'll call it tax reform it'll be in fact billions upon billions of maybe trillions of dollars in tax cuts and it'll pass like a knife through butter it'll be the easiest thing in the world and they're probably get some Democratic votes so well you know we have to be bipartisan where you know the people voted for Donald Trump but you know uh plus my daughters like it so that's what's gonna happen anyone who tells you otherwise though it doesn't know one thing about politics the one absolute rock-solid guaranteeing a trump presidency is giant unheard of record-breaking tax cuts and by the way the whole point Obama aid getting repeal Obama care is trying tax cuts they just cut six hundred billion dollars of taxes on for the rich and and they did at your expense and that's the appetizer yet we haven't gotten to the entree yet yeah I love I love how that works someday they're gonna pass a bill to rename an airport Airport and provide a trillion dollars in tax cuts I do either gonna do it but they could do it this is the hole in wolf's clothing what do you get for Young Turks membership it's a mystery only one way to find out tea white tea network.com /join
