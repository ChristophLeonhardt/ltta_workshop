the week after this election senior editor of Think Progress Ned reznikov and a screed online about his unfortunate experiences with his neighborhood plumber here is the harrowing story as quoted by roving journalist Michael Tracy he said quote I wanted to share an experience from earlier today this afternoon I had a plumber over to my apartment to fix a clogged drain he was a perfectly nice guy and a consummate professional but he was also a middle-aged white man with a southern accent who seemed unperturbed by this week's news and while I had him in the apartment I couldn't stop thinking about whether he had voted Trump whether he knew my last name is Jewish and how that knowledge might change the interaction we were having inside my own home I have no real reason to believe he was a trump supporter an anti-semite but in my uncertainty I couldn't shake the sense a potential danger this is real folks I was rattled for some time after he left I'm very privileged insofar as the sense of danger is unfamiliar to me and I know I feel it much less acutely than a lot of other people right now I'm still a straight white guy who can phenotype phenotype ugly you know typically pass for Gentile plus my first name is pretty waspey this is Ned Resnick off writing the day after the election or two days but today was a reminder that unambiguous social interactions now feel unsafe and unpredictable in a way they never did before and even if Trump is gone in four years I don't expect to ever reclaim that feeling of security that's just one more thing you voted for if you voted for him whoo okay then certain radical leftists constantly attribute motives to random people without knowing those people Plummers it turns out don't want to murder you just because they are plumbers it turns out many plumbers are even Democrats people with southern accents are not out to murder Jews unmask if you feel like you're living in near Nazi Germany because a random plumber came to your house at your request to fix your shower and then was polite but had a different accent and different profession than you you might be a political hypochondriac well stop hyperventilating and get out a bit more but the bubble only grows because people only associate with people with whom they agree particularly on the Left conservatives were confronted with leftists ideas and leftist personally on a pretty regular basis there's only one conservative cable news source Fox News there's only one major conservative national news publication The Wall Street Journal and even there the port Oriole side of the wall street journal' leans left hollywood the university's ESPN dominated by the left conservatives can't escape leftism leftist can escape conservatives so when their bubble is punctured they freak out it's why leftists are far more likely to defend someone on facebook for their politics then people are on the right this sort of paranoia it means it's going to be kind of difficult to live together and if you can't hire somebody to unclog your toilet because you're afraid they're secretly a brown shirt it's going to make it kind of tough to share a political system maybe leftist ought to take a step back and recognize the people with whom they disagree or people they don't even know aren't the awful evil villains they picture in their heads i'm ben shapiro this is the ben

after that election we're 60 some-odd million americans said that they really didn't care what how would thought Hollywood when all kanye west's imma let you finish we they basically they said we're gonna lecture you and we said no no and they sound let you finish but here's our lecture then they proceeded to lecture us so we had just celebrity after celebrity at the DNC and celebrity ad after celebrity ad during the election cycle and now we've had celebrity ads directed at electors and we've had celebrity ads directed at the press and we've had celebrity as directed at everything but the child molesters in Hollywood but you know they but they are still not tired of lecturing us because obviously if they have a forum then they must lecture well last night was the Golden Globes first thing to point out without the Golden Globes everyone always says the day after the Golden Globes or the Oscars God now that show was awful I've been alive for 32 years 33 next week and or I've been at least out of the womb for that amount of time and in that amount of time that I have been sentient I will say that I have never gone to the office the day after one of these big Hollywood events and people go WOW the Oscars was great last night wasn't it no one has ever said that so last night's Golden Globes was indeed atrocious but they're all atrocious because it's a bunch of Hollywood celebrities celebrating each other and telling each other how wonderful they are and then we're all annoyed because we think that they're not that wonderful but we go and pay money to see them anyway and then we watch them on TV congratulating each other and then were like god those are latest and then we turn on our TV to watch the elitists congratulate each okay so it's a little hypocritical the whole exercise but I do think that conservatives have a reason to be annoyed when these events are infused with politics and there are two reasons for that one is Hollywood is supposed to be our face to the rest of the world and was during the 30s 40s 50s it was sort of the American face to the rest of the world what we presented to the rest of the world as America came out of Hollywood and still globally what people think what America is they think of product from Hollywood because most foreigners have not been to the United States and so if they think of country America they tend to think of some movie that was made about country America or a TV show about country America if they see something about Texas they're more likely to know Texas from a movie like hell or high water than they are from having visited Texas so we all have sort of a stake in the image that Hollywood projects of what America is and when Hollywood skews solely to one side I think we have a right to be a little angry and Hollywood is very insular Hollywood is not just insular how what does discriminate against conservatives to prevent that alternative viewpoint from coming out I wrote a book about this called primetime propaganda and I went basically undercover and talked to a bunch of top Hollywood producers and they admitted openly to me on tape that yes they discriminate against conservatives and yes they bias their programming to the left they thought I was a member of the left because my last name is Shapiro and I was wearing a Harvard Law baseball cap so they figured Harvard law grad with Jewish last name got to be a Lib and obviously I wasn't but yes there's discrimination in Hollywood and that is a reason for conservatives to be upset that's reason number one reason number two is that there used to be in the United States this idea that yeah there was politics and yeah there's entertainment but entertainment was for lack of a better term to use the leftist term entertainment was sort of a safe space and when you went to the office the day after the world's here as you could talk about the World Series without talking politics when you watch the football game you could have over your friends on the other side of the political aisle and you could have fun talking about sports without having to worry about politics when you went you saw a movie when you watch the season of Game of Thrones you could watch a season of Game of Thrones and not have to be bothered with whether a head that was on a pike in season one was actually left over ahead of george w bush because the producers didn't like george w bush by the way that actually happened in game in season one of game of thrones a show that i really enjoy so it's when americans feel like they're common spaces are being ripped away from them when i feel like i can't have a conversation with someone on the left about Game of Thrones because they're gonna start lecturing me about Trump I watch Entertainment to get away from that I do it for a living right there's a reason I don't even watch house of cards I don't like watching political TV shows because I think that I do politics as a day job when I watch a TV show I want to be lost in the escapism of it if there's a message I want it to be subtle let me tease it out myself I don't need to be hit over the head with the unsubtle political musings of a bunch of 105 hi-q actors it's not something I'm into so people have a reason to be upset when they turn on the Golden Globes and you're watching because your wife wants to see all the pretty dresses or because you want to see whether that TV show you liked is going to get any Awards it's very annoying to be slapped in the face with by the way you're a bad person we're going to sit here and tell you're a bit as we consume your product you're going to tell me I'm a bad person we're the ones who watch your shows we're the ones who put the twenty million dollars in your pocket okay so virtually every virtually presenter last night felt the need to mouth off about Donald Trump this happened over and over and just to give you an idea Jimmy Fallon led off by targeting Donald Trump this is clip six this is the Golden Globes one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote but Game of Thrones is nominated tonight I'll graduate the show has so many plot twists and shocking moments a lot of people have wondered what it would've been like if King Joffrey had lived well in 12 days we're going to find out and you might remember Manchester by the seat for being the only thing from 2016 that was more depressing than 2016 the film Florence Foster Jenkins is nominated the character the character has been dubbed the world's worst opera singer and even she turned down performing at Donald Trump's inauguration it's a tough to book acceptable of course as always the ballots for tonight's Golden Globes were carefully tabulated by the accounting firm of Ernst and Young and Putin oh here we go okay so again joke after joke all of them lame and people who are watching at home they might think okay well where were you guys didn't make a single joke about Obama for eight years and in fact Obama sends a letter to all the celebrities that I think won in their swag bag at the Golden Globes and it wasn't really I mean that's not a joke I'm pretty sure that he wrote a letter that went to all of the various celebrities I know he had a big celebrity event on Friday night he sent a letter to all of them they party till four o'clock in the morning that was the first time that anybody at the White House had been awake to take a 3 a.m. phone call is when they were partying with the celebrities not with Benghazi but with the celebrities but that wasn't all right is he of Hugh Laurie for some reason dr. house was there and using the night manager he's a good actor doctor dr. house but he was there targeting Donald Trump as well I suppose made more amazing by the fact that I'll be able to say I won this at the last ever Golden Globes um I don't I don't mean to be gloomy it's just that it has the words Hollywood foreign and press in the title I just don't know one I also think that to some Republicans even the word Association is slightly sketchy okay first of all folks on the Left should not rip on freedom of association since its folks on the Left who want to use government to cram down their rules on religious communities but all of this was just prelude to Meryl Streep so Meryl Streep is the great goddess of Hollywood everyone worships at the altar of Meryl Streep I've never been a particularly big Meryl Streep fan I think early in her career she was really good and then later in her career she's gotten very mannered and you can see the gears turning all the time and you're always kind of watching going wow she's really good at crying you know you never gets the point we were like wow I really feel emotionally affected by her tears it's always like wow she was great when she cry wasn't she that was really awesome in any case not a critique of Meryl Streep's acting skills as much as a critique of what she said so last night she she does this speech and her entire speech it's a Lifetime Achievement Award and it took a lifetime for her to give the speech which he goes up there with cue cards and she rips on Donald Trump for basically about three and a half minutes four minutes and we will go through it because I think it is important to note why Americans are angry at this no let me say she has every right to do this she has every right to do this to free country I don't think that anybody should be SuperDuper crazy upset about the fact that an actress in lefty Hollywood gave a lefty Hollywood address to a bunch of other Hollywood lefties I think it's absurd that the left went what wouldn't act of heroism what Hera was it's always amazing for the left heroism amounts to saying stuff they agree with normally heroism is bravery in the face of adversity that's a pretty good general definition in order for that to happen there needs to be some adversity there's not a lot of adversity in a Hollywood crowd of people precisely two of whom in that entire crowd voted for Trump is like Vince Vaughn and Mel Gibson right that's it the entire crowd but but she obviously is the bravest woman who ever lived because she said something in front of a bunch of other Hollywood celebrities while wearing a $12,000 gown and having her hair done and making lots of money to be in movies like Florence Foster Jenkins which no one have ever seen but we will go through all that in just a moment first we have to say hello to our advertisers at D STL D so if you need jeans and jeans are your thing I wear jeans pretty much every day and jeans are extraordinarily expensive you need to go to DST LD calm right now the SD LD they have luxury gray denim starting at 75 bucks the jeans are really good they're really comfortable and they are really quality they last you can wash them a lot I've worn my jeans many a time and they are they're very comfortable they look good my wife tells me I just look phenomenal in them of course that could be just trying her to try and get access to the checkbook but I have no way of telling so I'll take credit her work but the genes themselves are really comfortable they look really good and so and they are they're much cheaper than they would be if you went to a top-line store 75 bucks at DST LD comm they ship to you directly they guarantee the fit and if they don't fit they'll send you a new pair until they are perfect and they will be a staple in your closet for years DST LD calm distilled calm / bed and go to / bed you get ten bucks off so that means you get it for 65 bucks pair of jeans instead of 75 bucks okay so play a little bit of Meryl Streep speech and then we'll go and then we'll break for a second so here is Meryl Streep last night at the Golden Globes going off um thank you Hollywood Foreign Press just to pick up on you what Hugh Laurie said you and all of us in this room really belonged to the most vilified segments in American society right now think about it Hollywood foreigners and the press his personal - Laurie has to be sitting there right now and I love I love whenever they have the cutaway shots of other adoring actors who they all hate each other they hate each other and they all go to the shots I love Meryl god I wish you were dead I mean this that's what all the faces are always in the audience these at these events but Hugh Laurie has to be steaming it was my joke first or it was my joke first and but in any case she goes on like this first of all quick note and then we'll go to break that is that that she says there that Hollywood foreigners and the press are the most vilified people in America they spent the entire night ripping on the people who live in flyover country I spent the entire night ripping on the rubes who voted for Donald Trump or didn't vote for Hillary Clinton the entire night yes you're right I'm sure that you are so vilified people hate you so much Meryl Streep what a victim you are all poor baby and the idea the press is vilified yeah the press is vilified I'm part of the press it turns out that a lot of the time we deserve the vilification sometimes we get it wrong sometimes we fib sometimes we lie and we deserve that but the idea that being vilified is the end of the world look you guys vilify trumpet every opportunity so if we're going to talk just if you're gonna dish it out you got to take it a little bit and this whole war victims because people are mean to us routine gets a little old when everybody in this room could buy the entire rest of America three times over it's a little bit galling to hear these these these limousine socialists talking about how vilified they are how rough it is for them okay well we
