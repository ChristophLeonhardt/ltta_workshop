big talker today rapper Meek Mill was released from prison Tuesday evening Dateline NBC got this exclusive photo moments after he got out the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered an immediate release of the hip-hop star after spending five months in jail for probation violations from a 2008 conviction on drug and Firearms charges when he was 19 years old the probation violations popping a wheelie and a scuffle at a Missouri Airport both charges were dismissed but he was still found in violation of probation and for those violations Meek Mill was sentenced to four years behind bars last week the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office said charges from that 2008 conviction should be vacated over questions of credibility surrounding the arresting officer meek has received a wave of high-profile endorsements including hip-hop moguls jay-z and Ti New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft an owner of the Philadelphia 76ers Michael Rubin and comedian Kevin Hart Hart was one of the first people to see the hip-hop star after his release and the home of the 76ers was one of Meeks first stops last night where he rang the bell to kick off Game five of the playoffs Jason Johnson david jolly back with me and Scott O'Neal the CEO of the 76ers of Scott first of all the 76ers don't normally have big winning runs like this and what a win for Meek Mill how did this even happen sure well first off we're the third winningest NBA franchise of all times but we have been on a bit of a tough slide but my your good friend is Josh and David Blitzer we're managing general partners have done an incredible job of getting this franchise aligned and kicking we are on full simple cylinders for one victory over the heat in the first round of playoffs and we are swimming towards more so we're very excited it's been a magical magical run but I think the start of incredible things to come their favorite son of the Philadelphia 76ers and Philadelphia to ring the bell which is kind of a ceremonial big thing we do before games Kevin Hart rang it in game to Doug Peterson the Super Bowl winning to fill up the Eagles right in game one so very fitting that meek would would come and ring the bell in the crowd went absolutely ballistic so a lot of fun for us tonight you mentioned Michael Reuben one of our partners was kind of a driving force along with jay-z in helping with his exoneration so it was a great night and a great celebration but what made you guys decide to do this you know Michael's a good friend of Meeks and he's a part of the family he's part of the Sixers family's been a fan for a long time been to several games and you know we thought that it was a really tough situation he found it I don't think there are many situations in the country where you're on probation for ten straight years so fortunately he's rightfully out and free and we thought he's such an incredible force for this city and his fans he thought of the great moment for us and for him well Philadelphia I mean the Eagles won there he is in front he's right next to Josh Harris there you are in that picture Kevin Hart what a night and you can see me Jason Nick plans to fight to overturn his conviction how do you think this is all going to go down I think this is a good precedent I mean one of the largest is we've been writing about this talking about this on the route is the idea that this happens to less famous people all the time you know you know poor people of all colors get thrown in jail on on ridiculous convictions on probations five 10 12 years ago and they don't have Robert Kraft and they don't have meek Millz money and they don't have Kevin Hart fighting on their behalf so the fact that he said look I have this experience but I'm gonna fight for other people I think that is a great move it'll be more memorable than most of his music well the question of me how will he fight further people he's gonna he's gonna push to overturn his sentence what's he gonna do beyond that because to that exact point he tweeted I understand that many people of color across the country don't have the that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues criminal justice reform is long overdue we know the racial disparity and if one party or the other refuses to recognize it then they're putting their head in the sand I think the opportunity and my worry the scourge is really across the 50 states where you see particularly people incarcerated base on mandatory minimum sentences for small crime small possession crimes and those can't be revisited because of the way the law works that is where we need leadership in the States to say this is wrong we need to remedy it we need to address cases like we saw with me remember Jared Kushner had said on the campaign trail to a number of people who are involved in criminal justice reform in New York he was going to make this a court focus when and if the president won he had experience because his father of course was incarcerated but we have not yet seen much happened I want to share NBC's Lester Holt spoke to me on the phone just a couple of weeks ago listen and jay-z says quote what's happening - Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day what's got to happen in the justices well first off you have to have real laws in place that are enforced equally that are forced consistently and then when we discover that those laws have not been enforced consistently there has to be a way to remedy and make those people whole just last week we're all talking about Starbucks and one of the things that I've mentioned right those two gentlemen got arrested they still have arrest records even if Starbucks gives them tons of money they have arrest records that have to be expunged and until they get that expunged think about you're a real estate agent every job you apply for every loan is going to say you have an arrest conviction even if it was thrown out so we need to not only make sure that the laws are applied equally but that the people who are unfairly convicted the people who are thrown into jail maliciously or malicious prosecution like me Mel they can be made whole afterwards and him making this a fight is going to make more people in that city and the state okay I don't want to pour rain on this this is inspiring it is good news last night was a beautiful ceremony but Meek Mill said when it's time to vote for governor's judges or DA's vote were being affected by it his statement is right yeah but remember what's happening President Trump is putting a record number of federal judges into those positions most coming directly from the Federalist Society under 40 white male judges so we can celebrate this all we want those judges are going to be in place forever you can't overlook the politics on this and the fact is Republicans have stood in the way of legitimate criminal justice reform they've looked the other way as we have seen numbers on racial disparity and frankly it is one of the reasons that they have only one one of the last seven popular votes in presidential elections because they are leaving constituencies behind it's shameful but you can't overlook the politics of it the first step is your local prosecutors they got a new local prosecutor in Philadelphia who has really really pushed forward for some advances in criminal justice reform we see the same thing in Florida we see in Cleveland it can happen it's got to start locally before you can do anything federally hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click
