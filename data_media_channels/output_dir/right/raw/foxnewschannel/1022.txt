00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:08,664
>>> WELCOME BACK TO THE NEXT

3
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:09,064
REVOLUTION.

4
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:11,099
MY NEXT GUEST IS AN INCREDIBLE

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,634
CHARACTER AGAINST OTHER THINGS

6
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:16,104
HE FOUNDED AND EXPOSED THE

7
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:16,839
CORRUPTION INSIDE OUR HEALTH

8
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:17,406
CARE SYSTEM.

9
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:20,209
HIS LATEST BOOK MAPS OUT HOW

10
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:23,512
THIS COUNTRY GOT TO WHERE IT IS

11
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:24,079
AND HOW WE CAN FIX IT.

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,015
IT'S CALLED TAIL SPIN.

13
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:29,585
BY THE WAY, BIG NEWS, IT HIT THE

14
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:31,420
BEST SELLER LIST TODAY, WE'RE

15
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:31,720
TOLD.

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,422
WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT THE AUTHOR

17
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:33,789
IS HERE.

18
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:35,457
IT'S FANTASTIC TO SEE YOU.

19
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:36,191
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

20
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:38,360
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

21
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,228
>> STEVE:  I ACTUALLY BOUGHT

22
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:40,229
THIS BOOK MYSELF.

23
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:41,063
I'M NOT JUST SAYING IT.

24
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:42,498
>> YOU PUT IT ON THE LIST.

25
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:43,031
>> STEVE:  EXACTLY.

26
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,500
IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

27
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,905
AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY

28
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:50,606
ANY OF YOUR COMMENTS.

29
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:51,240
WE'LL DIVE IN.

30
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,741
>> THE ARGUMENT IS BEGINNING IN

31
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,810
THE LATE 1960s, EARLY 1970s, ALL

32
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,646
THESE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE

33
00:00:57,646 --> 00:00:59,081
HAPPENING IN AMERICA GRADUALLY

34
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:00,616
STARTED TO TURN AGAINST US.

35
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:01,817
>> STEVE:  UH-HUH.

36
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:08,223
>> TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE,

37
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:10,392
AMERITORACY, OBVIOUSLY A GREAT

38
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:10,692
DEAL.

39
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:11,460
GOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO YALE

40
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:11,994
BECAUSE OF THAT.

41
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:15,397
THROUGH A SERIES OF TWISTS AND

42
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:21,770
TURNS, THE MERITOCRACY ENDED UP

43
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,938
ARMING ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS

44
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:24,239
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,275
EARLIER SEGMENT WITH PEOPLE WHO

46
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:29,545
WERE SMARTER AND TOUGHER AND,

47
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,446
FRANKLY, MORE INCLINED TO

48
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:32,781
ACHIEVE WHATEVER THEY COULD ON

49
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:36,418
THEIR OWN AND NOT WORRY ABOUT

50
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:37,085
THE COMMON GOOD.

51
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:41,323
>> STEVE:  SO YOU RUN THINGS

52
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:42,057
LIKE THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, FOR

53
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:42,391
EXAMPLE.

54
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,125
>> THE FINANCIAL SECTOR IS A

55
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:43,825
GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE FIRST

56
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:44,192
AMENDMENT.

57
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,327
WE ALL LOVE THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

58
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,729
BUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT HAS BEEN

59
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,832
USED IN ESSENCE TO MONETIZE THE

60
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:55,871
POLITICAL SYSTEM IN THIS

61
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,439
COUNTRY.

62
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,073
>> STEVE:  EXPLAIN THAT.

63
00:01:58,073 --> 00:01:59,241
>> IN A SERIES OF COURT

64
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:01,543
DECISIONS -- AND I THINK

65
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:02,277
ACTUALLY RIGHTLY THE KEY THING

66
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:04,212
ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS THE

67
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:06,148
BENEFIT TO THOSE WHO LISTEN TO

68
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:06,481
SPEECH.

69
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,983
NOT NECESSARILY THE SPEAKER.

70
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:08,584
>> STEVE:  UH-HUH.

71
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,853
>> SO IF THE BENEFIT IS TO THOSE

72
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:12,854
WHO LISTEN, THEN WHY WOULD YOU

73
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:13,689
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THOSE WHO

74
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:15,557
ARE SPEAKING AND SAY, WELL, A

75
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,925
PERSON CAN SPEAK BUT A

76
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:17,893
CORPORATION CAN'T.

77
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:19,261
AND THAT'S A TERRIFIC ARGUMENT

78
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,363
UNTIL YOU LOOK AT IT AND SAY,

79
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,198
WELL, WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

80
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:25,100
ANY CORPORATION IN AMERICA CAN

81
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,404
GIVE AS MUCH MONEY AS IT WANTS

82
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:30,872
TO ANY CANDIDATE THAT IT WANTS.

83
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:34,076
SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED THERE IS

84
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:36,111
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

85
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:40,415
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS MY LIBERAL

86
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:41,049
FRIENDS DON'T LIKE THIS,

87
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:42,484
CITIZENS UNITED IF YOU READ THE

88
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:43,919
CONSTITUTION I THINK WAS

89
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,671
ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE THEED

90
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:45,988
ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE THEE

91
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:46,021
ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEEE

92
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:46,555
ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEED

93
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:46,588
ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEED T

94
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:47,656
ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEED TO

95
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:48,624
FIX IT.

96
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:51,193
>> STEVE:  THE WAY THAT

97
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:52,928
FINANCIAL ENGINEERING TOOK OVER

98
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:56,098
THE ECONOMY AND PUSHED OUT

99
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:59,034
MANUFACTURING, JUST EXPLAIN HOW

100
00:02:59,034 --> 00:02:59,534
YOUR ARGUMENT --

101
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,036
>> CREATE A KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY

102
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:07,809
WHICH IS WHAT AMERITOCRACY DOES.

103
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,578
THAT'S LEGAL KNOWLEDGE OR

104
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,680
BANKING KNOWLEDGE OR THE

105
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,281
FINANCIAL ENGINEERING THAT

106
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:20,389
BASICALLY TURNS THE COUNTRY INTO

107
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,240
AN ECONOMY WHEREAS

108
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,357
AN ECONOMY WHEREA

109
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:22,391
AN ECONOMY WHERE

110
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:22,424
AN ECONOMY WHERE AS

111
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:22,457
AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSE

112
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:22,491
AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSETS

113
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:22,524
AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSETS A

114
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:23,959
AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSETS ARE

115
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,728
TRADED.

116
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:27,462
THEY'RE TURNED INTO MORTGAGES

117
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:27,996
BACK TO SECURITIES.

118
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:31,900
THERE IS OFTEN STOCK BUYBACKS.

119
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,601
ALL THIS STUFF THAT MAKES THE

120
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,603
BANKERS AND LAWYERS A TREMENDOUS

121
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:35,937
AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT DOESN'T

122
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:36,938
CREATE A SINGLE JOB.

123
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:38,340
IN FACT, IT KILLS JOBS.

124
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,508
>> STEVE:  THIS IS INTERESTING.

125
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,076
ALL OF THESE THREADS COME

126
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:42,411
TOGETHER, I THINK.

127
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,345
AND YOU'RE SAYING 50 YEARS TO

128
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:47,349
THE MOMENT WHERE YOU FIND PEOPLE

129
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,083
HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND THEY ELECT

130
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,517
DONALD TRUMP.

131
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:48,984
>> Lisa:  YES.

132
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:52,454
SO HOW MUCH -- BASED OFF OF YOUR

133
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:53,188
BOOK, HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK ALL

134
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,056
THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS, AS

135
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:55,924
STEVE JUST LAID OUT, HOW MUCH

136
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:59,127
DOES THAT LEAD TO WHERE WE

137
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:00,028
CURRENTLY ARE IN A POLITICAL

138
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:00,362
SOCIETY.

139
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,064
>> THAT, IN FACT, IS THE WAY THE

140
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:03,398
BOOK ENDS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO

141
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:04,633
AREN'T IN THE MIDDLE.

142
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:08,136
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T IN THE

143
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:08,837
KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY WHO FEEL SO

144
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:09,638
SHUT OUT AND SO FRUSTRATED THAT

145
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:11,606
THEY TURN TO A GUY WHO PROMISES

146
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:15,177
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT

147
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:17,079
IS DIFFERENT.

148
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,379
NOW,

149
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:18,245
>> Lisa:  WHICH HE HAS.

150
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:18,680
[ LAUGHING ]

151
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,716
>>  WELL, HE HAS.

152
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:21,382
BUT HE'S ALSO DONE A LOT OF

153
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:22,551
THINGS THAT HAVE HURT THE PEOPLE

154
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,653
WHO VOTED FOR HIM.

155
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:27,322
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET RID OF

156
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,524
THE PAY DAY LENDING NEGOTIATION

157
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:32,994
SO THE PAY DAY LENDERS CAN GO

158
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:33,729
BACK AND CHARGE THESE WORKERS

159
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:35,197
WHO ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE

160
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,665
JOBS 100% INTEREST, THAT'S NOT A

161
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:38,266
GREAT THING.

162
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,067
>> Lisa:  YOU TALK ABOUT TOO

163
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,235
OBVIOUSLY THE THINGS THAT YOU

164
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:41,303
FOCUS IN THESE INSTITUTION

165
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:44,072
THAT'S ARE NOW CORRUPT AND HAVE

166
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,974
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SOCIETY.

167
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:48,944
WHAT OTHER --

168
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,246
>> STEVE:  FINISH YOUR POINT.

169
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:52,047
>> Lisa:  WHAT OTHER

170
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,014
INSTITUTIONS DO YOU LABEL AT OR

171
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,149
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT DO YOU

172
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,016
DISCUSS IN THE BOOK?

173
00:04:55,016 --> 00:05:00,489
>> WELL, PRETTY MUCH THE LEGAL

174
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:00,822
ECONOMY.

175
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,257
AND I ACTUALLY AM AWARE WITH

176
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:04,726
THAT.

177
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:05,293
THE FINANCIAL ECONOMY.

178
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:06,728
JUST THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE

179
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:08,964
KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY.

180
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:09,698
>> STEVE:  I WAS INTERESTED.

181
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:12,067
IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING.

182
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:12,901
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

183
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,503
THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING

184
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:16,671
POINT THE WAY DUE PROCESS AND

185
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,839
LEGAL PROCESS HAS ACTUALLY HAD

186
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,274
SUCH A NEGATIVE IMPACT.

187
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,176
AND THE LAWYERS ARE SORT OF --

188
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,245
HAVE SORT OF GOTTEN TO

189
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:23,645
EVERYTHING.

190
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:24,479
>> THE LAWYERS IN WASHINGTON

191
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,884
BETWEEN 1973 AND 1983 TRIPLED.

192
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:30,185
AND WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

193
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,153
THEY WERE LOBBYING.

194
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:32,387
AND THEY WERE LOBBYING IN

195
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:37,259
CONGRESS AND LOBBYING THE

196
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,660
REGULATORY AGENCIES.

197
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,762
THE FIRST REGULATORY AGENCY IN

198
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:41,863
1974 WAS TEN PAGES LONG AND TOOK

199
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,465
LESS THAN A YEAR TO WRITE, WHICH

200
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:44,599
I THINK IS STILL TOO LONG.

201
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,003
THE LAST ONE WRITTEN IN 2017 WAS

202
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:50,038
604 PAGES LONG AND TOOK 19 YEARS

203
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:50,672
TO WRITE.

204
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:51,640
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS GOING

205
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,308
ON IN THOSE 19 YEARS?

206
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:55,043
THE LOBBYISTS WERE FIGHTING OVER

207
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:57,946
-- AND ONCE THEY PRODUCE THE 604

208
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,014
PAGE REGULATION, THEN THEY CAN

209
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:00,415
FIGHT OVER ALL OF THE PARAGRAPHS

210
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:02,384
ON ALL 604 OF THOSE PAGES WHEN

211
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:04,352
SOMEONE TRIES TO ENFORCE THE

212
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:04,820
REGULATION.

213
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,354
THAT IS THE ECONOMY WE CREATED.

214
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:07,322
>> STEVE:  AND THE OTHER POINT

215
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,825
YOU MAKE IS THAT THIS EMPOWERS

216
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:11,359
THE BIG CORPORATION, THE BIG

217
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:11,726
BUSINESS.

218
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:12,794
THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD THE LAWYERS

219
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:13,428
AND EVERYTHING.

220
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:16,464
AND, AGAIN, THAT'S PART OF THIS

221
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,566
POPULIST MOVEMENT WHICH IS

222
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:18,800
PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THOSE -- THE

223
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,502
BIG CENTRALIZED ORGANIZATIONS

224
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:21,837
HAVING ALL OF THE POWER.

225
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,305
>> Lisa:  THAT WAS SORT OF THE

226
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,072
MESSAGE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP RAN

227
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,640
WITH DURING THE ELECTION, RIGHT.

228
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,075
IT WAS STANDING UP FOR THE

229
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:28,243
FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN.

230
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:29,644
MANY PEOPLE THAT FELT LIKE

231
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:30,946
POLITICIANS DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH

232
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:31,913
TO COME AND EVEN SPEAK WITH

233
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:32,280
THEM.

234
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,849
LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON.

235
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,283
SHE DIDN'T EVEN STEP FOOT IN THE

236
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:36,084
STATE OF WISCONSIN.

237
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:36,384
RIGHT.

238
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,385
SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE

239
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,054
STATE WHO FELT LIKE THEIR VOICES

240
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:40,689
WERE FORGOTTEN, OBVIOUSLY IT

241
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:41,356
WAS.

242
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:49,097
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE

243
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:49,798
HILLARY CLINTON WHO MANY DEEM

244
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:50,198
WAS AN ELITE

245
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:50,232
WAS AN ELIIS

246
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:50,265
WAS AN ELIIST

247
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:50,298
WAS AN ELIIST WH

248
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:50,332
WAS AN ELIIST WHO

249
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:50,365
WAS AN ELIIST WHO DI

250
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:50,398
WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN

251
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:50,432
WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T

252
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:50,465
WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T E

253
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:50,498
WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T EVE

254
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:50,732
WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T EVEN

255
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:51,533
BOTHER TO STEP FOOT AND TALK TO

256
00:06:51,533 --> 00:00:00,000
THE GENERAL ELECTION.
