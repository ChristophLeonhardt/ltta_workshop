birthday and president Trump is 72 years old today which is pretty amazing I mean the guy is the oldest president ever elected and he is fit as a fiddle and ready for lovin president Trump is obviously an energetic dude and he's celebrating a good birthday I mean let's let's be real about this the President of the United States is is having himself in upswing in the polls and there are a lot of elements where the president looks really good so the this is a great story for him today the Federal Reserve's just raised its outlook on u.s. economic growth on Wednesday the median real GDP forecast Rose rose to 2.8 percent up from 2.7 percent for this year there are no changes for 2019 and 2020 economic activity has been rising at a solid right according to the Fed statement marking an upgrade from moderate in the previous statement also there is a report out today put out by Jim Pathak Lucas all about how the there are banks that were now revising the growth estimates for the last quarter up dramatically all the way up to four percent from two point eight percent and what we are seeing here is a booming economy this is the quote from JP Morgan actually on the heels of this data we now estimate real GDP is expanding at a 4.0 annual rate in q2 up from our prior estimate of 2.75 almost twice the 2.2 percent growth rate experienced in q1 I'm old enough to remember when it was considered crazy when President Trump suggested that he was going to get the annual growth rate up to four or five percent of GDP and now what's happening right now it appears to be happening so that is great news for the President of the United States obviously the North Korean summit is also very good news for the presidents of the United States at least in terms of public relations the public is very happy that President Trump did this they think that maybe just maybe this will open us up to a new world we'll talk a little bit about that in a bit what it is that that is being opened up here whether in fact President Trump has open negotiations that will lead to denuclearization of the North Korean Peninsula or whether what we are really talking about is another sort of plan that president from has in my know and talked about that in a little while plus in sort of hilarious news you recall that President Obama spent an inordinate amount of time attempting to bring the World Cup to the United States so he cut a video in 2009 he talked with Sepp Blatter who's the head at that point of five of the World Cup about bringing the World Cup to the United States in I believe he's 2022 well now it turns out that the administration that got it done is actually the Trump administration now the Trump administration was involved in sort of covert ways right in quiet ways but they put together what's called the United bit the United bid was a bid for the World Cup between Canada China Canada Mexico and the United States and that group is going to host some 80 World Cup games the vote past so they are going to host the World Cup 60 of those games will be held in the United States 60 of those matches now I am NOT a soccer fan so I really don't care all that much but it is a thumb in the eye to the Obama administration that spent years trying to woo the World Cup to the United States and then President Trump gets it done in the first year and a half so that's that's pretty hilarious and you have to enjoy that so President Trump is having himself a good birthday adding to that good birthday is the fact that the Department of Justice Inspector General report just released a report blasting James Comey for violating FBI protocol during the Hillary Clinton investigation now this is a report that's going to be interpreted a couple of different ways it's going to be interpreted in the worst possible light for the FBI by Republicans and the best possible light for but for the FBI by Democrats here's what the report actually says so on Thursday Bloomberg News got the early scoop on the DOJ inspector general's report on the actions of the FBI during the 2016 election cycle with regard to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's misuse of her email server so according to Bloomberg the reports conclusion from Inspector General Michael Horowitz you remember this guy is the same one who recommended the prosecution of former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe for leaking information in an authorized fashion to the Pres so he has a pretty good track record of calling things out when he sees them he says that James Comey and the FBI violated protocol but did not do so for reasons of political bias and this is where the Republicans are going to be spitting man what they are going to say is that of course James Comey operated by breaking protocol in terms of political bias and the left is going to say the same thing by the way they're gonna say that the FBI violated protocol in order to make Hillary lose the election every boy every buddy's going to attribute to James coming in the FBI political bias I think there is political bias but not quite in the way that people think the political bias works so people think political bias means that combing elect Hillary or combing like Trump I don't think that's the political bias at work here I think the political bias at work is that James Comey wanted to exonerate Hillary Clinton knowing that that's what the DOJ wanted him to do and at the same time he didn't want the FBI slandered with the idea that the FBI had been ordered by the DOJ to clear the the the clear-all of this or they also didn't want the DOJ to look corrupt so instead he took it on his own shoulders I think the commis are an explanation of his event of these events is damning enough I don't think you have to make up another explanation for why it is that Jim's coming violated protocol here's what the the the DOJ report concludes the IG report concludes quote well we did not find that these decisions were the result of political bias on commis part we nevertheless concluded that by departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and department norms the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice so here is what Michael Horowitz claims he says the James Comey had troublingly failed to inform the Department of Justice in advance about his July 5th statement condemning Clinton for carelessness but absolving her of criminal activity so in other words James Comey had been told by Loretta Lynch that she would basically accept his recommendation instead of him going to Loretta Lynch with his recommendation quietly and then learn a Lynch announcing everything he went out there and he did his famous July 5th press conference where he basically announced that Hillary was guilty but he wasn't going to recommend prosecution for her anyway because she didn't have requisite intent even though the law itself does not need intent the law is written along lines of negligence it is not written along lines of Hillary Clinton must have wanted to expose classified information to foreign sources but James Comey added that elements of law and then he said later that we wouldn't prosecute anybody under these same circumstances which is sort of a dicey proposition Michael Horowitz says that the big problem here is not the actual statement that Comey made it's that James Comey did not coordinate with Loretta Lynch on all of this yeah it's a little bit weak men Horowitz said that commis failure to coordinate with the DOJ involved a quote troubling lack of any direct substantive communication with Lynch Horowitz added that Comey also should have coordinated with Loretta Lynch before sending his October 28th 2016 letter to Congress announcing the reopening of the Hillary email investigation based on the discoveries on Anthony Weiner's computer here's what Horowitz writes quote we found it extraordinary that in advance of to such consequential decisions the FBI director decided that the best course of conduct most do not speak directly and substantively with the Attorney General about how best to navigate those decisions now Comey will say the reason I didn't talk to Loretta Lynch is cuz I thought Loretta Lynch might be corrupt she'd met on the tarmac with Bill Clinton the right will say the reason that Comey didn't coordinate with Loretta Lynch on all this is because he didn't want to look her up but he actually was corrupt he knew what Loretta Lynch wanted and he gave it to her so both sides are gonna read this report the way they want to read this report Horowitz also investigated anti-trump text messages between the FBI agents Peter struck and Lisa Paige remember there were all these anti-trump text messages during the campaign about how much they disliked Trump and Horowitz found there was quote no documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations including political bias directly affected these specific investigative actions we reviewed now it's worth noting that is pretty weak legal language there right that's a little bit of lawyer fudging right there when he says that there's no evidence that improper considerations including political bias quote directly affected the specific investigative actions how about indirectly affected these specific investigative actions what if it's not that they decided they were gonna get Trump overtly but they decide they were gonna be a little harder on President Trump or a little bit easier on Hillary Clinton cuz they didn't like President Trump right that's a little bit of wiggle room in the language Horowitz said the contact by these employees did cast a doubt over the entire FBI investigation so as I say it's easy to look at this report and see how Republicans come to the conclusion that Comey acted politically how Democrats come to the conclusion that Comey acted politically because after all Comey did more damage to Hillary Clinton than he did to Donald Trump during the during the campaign itself i coming to tremendous damage to donald trump after the campaign once trump was president but commis real damaging impact during the campaign itself was actually anti-hillary every was the reopening the investigation in late october the damaged hillary clinton you know right about the time that she needed a surge in the polls and instead she faded in the polls so dramatically the chins up losing the election so democrats are gonna claim that the report is biased Republicans are already claiming that the report is biased there are a bunch of Republican Congress people who have put out a letter to the director of the Inspector General of the DOJ asking for drafts of the report they want to make sure that it was not watered down so here is what Andy Biggs Ron DeSantis and Matt gets right they say we are concerned that during this time people may have changed the report in a way that obfuscates your findings per Congress's oversight authority we request you supply our original drafts along with the final published form unfortunately over the past year the DOJ has repeatedly fought requests by Congress to produce documents related to this investigation and when the DOJ actually provided documents the materials have been heavily redacted past and present DOJ officials have asserted security concerns even though the documents we have seen do not legitimately contain these issues with every confidence your investigation and report has been thorough and accurate we request the various draft so they want the draft of the report they think the Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein over at the DOJ had some sort of impact on Michael Horowitz his final report in this Inspector General report I don't blame them for being suspicious after all sessions and Rosenstein have not been forthcoming with documents that have been subpoenaed by Congress at the same time I don't really blame the DOJ for being suspicious of Republican Congress people who've been leaking as much as they can to the press at the first available opportunity and sometimes taking things out of context this is why I've been saying for a long time President Trump should just declassify everything he can possibly declassify the President of the United States does have the executive authority does he classify as many materials as he wishes there in the executive branch I want to see all of them I want to get to the bottom of this I think everyone else does too and I think that these secondhand reports are not nearly as useful as our ability to peruse the documentation ourselves okay so in just a second I wanna talk about another of breaking news that is not as good for president Trump's this IG report is pretty decent for president trumpets as Comey miss acted badly that's gonna be enough for president from to go after him there's a piece of bad news for president Trump I want to talk about in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at dynatrap so summertime is officially upon us and the only thing more annoying than Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the

wildly anti Trump wildly anti-republican right the New York Attorney General is so anti Trump and anti Republican that after dinesh d'souza was given a pardon you recall the New York Attorney General's Office stumped for an end to quote-unquote double jeopardy rules that allowed dinesh d'souza to escape ok the whole point of a double jeopardy rule is that once you've been pardoned you've been pardoned or if you're acquitted you're acquitted we don't get to try you twice for the same crime the New York Attorney General's Office said we should create state laws that allow us to try you twice for the same crime which is idiotic so it's a very very biased New York Attorney General's Office however they did unveil a lawsuit against the Trump foundation they are now calling for the Trump foundation to be forcibly shut down the lawsuit was also launched against President Trump Donald Trump jr. Ivanka Trump erich fromm their accusation is that the Trump campaign used the Trump foundation itself as a goody bag for various political purposes so according to the New York Attorney General their investigation found that the Trump foundation raised in excess of 2.8 million dollars in a manner designed to influence the 2016 presidential election at the direction and under the control of senior leadership of the Trump presidential campaign they say that in violation of state and federal law senior Trump campaign staff including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski dictated the timing amounts and recipients of grants by the foundation to nonprofits and then they include for example an email from Corey Lewandowski to the head of the Trump Foundation saying Allan is there any way that we can make some disbursements this week while we are in Iowa specifically on Saturday meaning it's in the middle of the campaign can we make some foundation charitable contributions in Iowa because we're in the middle of the campaign right that's pretty damning stuff and that is not useful to to the Trump Foundation's claims of objectivity and in separation now so I think these charges are being wildly over publicized yes do I think that these charges are also somewhat selective in the in the way that charities run yes and I'll explain that in in just a couple of moments but the New York Attorney General's Office continues the Trump Foundation also entered into at least five self-dealing transactions that were unlawful because they benefited mr. Trump or businesses that he controls they say these include $100,000 payment to settle legal claims against mr. Trump's mar-a-lago resort one hundred and fifty eight thousand dollars to settle legal claims against trump National Golf Club and ten thousand dollars to purchase a painting of mr. Trump displayed at the Trump national Doral all these are taking a little out of context and might explain them in a second in light of this misconduct and total lack of oversight we are also suing to dissolve the Trump foundation under court supervision and barred Donald Trump and other members of the trem Foundation board of directors from serving on the board of any other New York charity now does this seem overly harsh it does I'm gonna explain why right now so the investigation into the Trump foundation was launched in the middle of the campaign in June 2016 what caused this investigation to be launched well in January President Trump decided that he was going to skip a Fox News Channel presidential debate you remember this megyn kelly did a debate and he didn't like the answer the questions that he was being asked during that debate and so President Trump decided to skip that debate instead he counts a program that I made with a charity event for fun a charity fundraiser for veterans right and the AG's office claims that this event was not designed to raise money for charity but to benefit Trump politically they say it was quote a trump campaign event in which the foundation participated the event was planned by the campaign allegedly with administrative assistance from the foundation the real problem began when the foundation ceded control over the charitable funds it raised to senior Trump campaign staff who dictated the manner in which the foundation would disperse those proceeds directed the timing amounts and recipients of the grants Trump used checks from photo ops with his presidential campaign slogan on the checks for example I can act you can actually see their you know pictures of President Trump holding these giant blow up checks $100,000 to a veteran's group and on the bottom it says Trump make America great again so it's a foundation being used for political purposes by the Trump campaign now a lot of people on the right are immediately going to flashback to the Clinton Foundation and the idea the Clinton Foundation was basically a pass-through for the Clintons that if you gave Hillary Clinton's Foundation a bunch of money suddenly you got a meeting with the State Department or if you were warm with the Clinton Foundation suddenly the State Department Hillary Clinton they they were pretty warm toward allowing the State Department to make deals with with your particular company in a foreign country or they start pushing particular policy and you would be right to be concerned about this and you would be right to wonder did the New York Attorney General's Office ever do a similar investigation of the Clinton Foundation and the answer is probably not now this is not what about ISM because if the Trump Foundation violated the law which it appears they have in some ways then they will be punished and they will be fined but it is also important to note that political bias in the New York AG's office has been rife for years but whether it's eliot spitzer or there was eric schneiderman or whether it is the current New York Attorney General this is an office that has been used for vindictive political purposes by a bunch of Democrats for a very very long time and I find it highly suspicious that they say the term Foundation was acting badly for 25 years for 30 years and yet only during the campaign did they see fit to launch an investigation to the front foundation you want to talk about a ginned up investigation that looks like it now again does that mean that the Trump Foundation didn't act illegally no it looks like the term Foundation didactic legally so for example Donald Trump personally directed foundation funds to be used to settle a lawsuit related to mar-a-lago so Mara Lago was sued in 2006 for some sort of zoning violation and they were ordered to give a hundred thousand dollars to charity and Trump instead of signing out of his pocket a hundred thousand dollars to charity told his foundation to give a hundred thousand dollars to a different charity now you know is that really all that corrupts considering that Trump supposedly gives a fair bit of money to his own foundation well I mean again if you money to his foundation and then the and then he tells his foundation to give money to another foundation in the end charities receiving the money right the same thing is true in Iowa right in Iowa there's a lot of complaints about he was doing this for political purposes which is probably correct did the veterans receive the money or do they not receive the money I mean they apparently received the money there were complaints for a long time they were not going to receive the money now again it is also worth noting here that prosecutions of charities tend to be very selective so I've worked with a number of 500 series violation of the law and 501 C 3 s is rife okay it is rife 501 C 3 s are loosely handled they are they are generally handled with with not the proper amounts of care major board organizations you know organizations that have a hundred million dollars in bank two hundred million dollars in the bank these are run really in accordance with the law because they can't afford an audit but a lot of smaller organizations like the Trump Foundation run sort of haphazardly and conveniently and it's easy for people to get caught up in the haphazard and convenience of it and they just use it how they want to use it and then there's violation of the law does this mean that Trump is deeply corrupt something horrible happened here all of the payments that were made from the Trump foundation were made to other charities on behalf of Donald Trump and the Trump foundation so do I think this is the end of the world for President Trump I don't is it a prosecution that has some legs yeah it probably does I mean it'll probably stands up in court it is just worthwhile noting that the New York AG's office seems rather they seem rather pumped up about this investigation as opposed to other investigations of charities that they have done before again if these same allegations were made about the Clinton Foundation I assume people on the right would be fully up in arms but I also think that you know it is worth looking at the extent of the violations here in the extensive the violations here does not appear to me to be supremely great we're talking about ten hundred thousand dollars here and there and again money given from one charity to another charity yes for Trump's personal benefit but unfortunately I know too much about charities to be particularly perturbed about this this set of charges okay meanwhile President Trump continues to to push forward on the North Korean summit and the and the after-effects of that we'll talk about that in just a second but first I want to talk about your target practice okay so the fact is you probably don't go to the range often enough okay forty-two percent of American households have a firearm with three and five receiving formal firearms training but an even smaller percentage of regularly practice with the weapon they would use an self-defense situation my wife and I we don't go to the range all that much right we own a 9-millimeter and we want a shotgun and we don't go to the range all that much because we have two kids who has time to go to the range well that means that if you're not practicing and probably getting to be a war shot right you're not keeping up with the times and that is why I target exists also a most expensive and we go to arrange it gets really expensive well so there's something called the AI target Pro the AI target Pro is the coolest most fun thing so here is what it is they use your actual gun so you can become proficient with the firearm you are actually going to use in real life you use your smartphone and the proprietary app uses a laser in place of the bullet and will detect exactly where your shots are land in the way that it works is you have something that looks like a bullet actually has a laser inside you load it into the chamber of the gun so that it is firing directly down the line of where you are firing and then you're essentially firing at a screen your phone can pick it up and evaluate exactly how you were doing in terms of your shooting so you can practice home defense you can test different angles you can Mack to maximize your tactical advantage in your own home and you can do it with your personal firearm so you get more and more familiar with a firearm that God forbidden it in an emergency situation you might have to use right now you can save 10% with the offer code Shapiro when you purchase the I target pro system I'm using it I'm gonna get my wife to use it as well and it is supremely easy to setup I mean very easy to setup and very easy to use you can save money time take your skill to the next level safely and effectively there are folks in our office who are legitimate like target shooting champions and they use AI target Pro at home that is the letter I to AI target procom use promo code Shapiro and save 10% what the offer code Shapiro when you purchase the AI target pro system it's a lot of fun it's really cool it'll make your shooting better and it is safe I mean it's you're not firing anything so it's absolutely safe alrighty so meanwhile President Trump continues to forge ahead with this North Korean summit fallout and I want to talk a little bit about what president Trump's goals are with regard to North Korea so there's been a lot of talk about denuclearization is that really Trump's goal is that really something that is going to happen here I do not think that this is Trump's goal I do not think the denuclearization is something that's actually going to happen because I think if you're kim jeong-hoon you'd have to be a moron to give up your nukes now your nukes are what brought you to the table your nukes are what made everybody pay attention to you your nuclear program over the past 30 years has allowed you to be bribed by the west over and over and over what this really is if we were really gonna be honest about this what this really is is Trump attempting to do what Nixon did when Nixon went to China opening up China liberal in China turning China from a one-party dictatorship that was repressive in extraordinary amounts against his people and militaristic as well into a still militaristic still repressive regime but less than it was I think that's the idea here turning North Korea into Vietnam right turning a threatening communist country into a slightly less threatening communist country if that were the actual goal here the stated goal here and then you'd sort of understand what Trump is doing a little bit better than the claims that North Korea has become a non threat or that they are going to denuclearize I don't think any of that is going to happen it is also worth stating that president tack the president comes tactics here something new now we're not gonna know whether the tactics are good or bad until we have the effect of the tactic we're not going to know whether or not this is effective until we find out what exactly Kim jong-un is willing to give up but the president is taking a very high risk tactic here and his high-risk tactic is that he's going to flatter Kim jong-un into liking him he's gonna flatter Kim jong-un into believing he can be part of the family of Nations I'm not a big believer in this tactic I wasn't a big believer in this tactic when President Trump did it with Iran well I mean when President Obama did it with him Iran when he said these are the moderates the mullahs that we're gonna put them aside the moderates in Iran will be elevated by involvement in the world economy global is a the the the hilarity of this sort of position actually is that President Trump's position he's very anti-globalist but he's essentially saying globalization integration into the world economy is gonna make North Korea more moderate and hey sure I guess worth a shot we've been trying this for for several decades and it's not actually working so maybe something different is called for and new with that said there is another question and that is how far does Trump have to go in order to try to integrate Kim Jong Un's of the world economy does he actually does he actually have to praise him to the skies the way that he has been doing because some of the stuff the president Trump has been saying is is just I mean there's no other way to put it tomorrow okay so what was so president Trump was asked by Bret Baier about the North Korean dictator and here's what President Trump had to say about Kim jong-un you were asked in the press conference a number of different times in different ways about human rights and you know that you called this relationship really good and that he very talented person you know you call people sometimes killers he know he is a killer he's clearly is executing people hey when you take over a country tough country tough people and you take it over from your father I don't care who you are what you are how much of an advantage you have if you could do that at 27 years old you I mean that's one in 10,000 that could do that so he's a very smart guy he's a great negotiator but I think we understand each other but him he still some done some really bad things yeah but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things I mean I could go through a lot of nation's where a lot of bad things were done now look with all of that being said yes okay so he says yes he's done some really bad things but a lot of other nations are doing really bad things and then he says that you know only one in 10,000 people could have taken over a country twenty-seven not true there are plenty of dictators who have hands it over to their sons but in any case the question is why would President Trump do this because let's look at the reality of North Korea North Korea isn't just any other place in North Korea is the worst place to live maybe on planet Earth okay here is some testimony of a North Korean survivor who escaped ok here's what it's like to be in North Korea the country every night someone tries to escape or someone doesn't obey their orders somebody who's in the gulags for that they strip you naked and start the beat up they beat you all night long every night when the lights go out it's time to sleep but from every room there are sounds sounds of beatings I mean North Korea is an awful awful awful place and the president doesn't have to make light of that in order to in order to get Kim jong-un to the table it's not necessary now does that mean that president Trump doesn't actually recognized the evils of Kim jong-un I don't think so I mean I think that President Trump just has a sneaking I think President Trump operates in one of two modes either he hates you or he loves you I don't think there's a lot of in-between with President Trump as a human being I think the president Trump either hates you and then he gives you a nickname on Twitter or he loves you in which case you are the greatest person who ever was so he has the best relationships right when he was at the g7 like three days ago when he evaluated his relationships with the other people at the g7 on a scale of one to ten it was a ten but there is no five and president Trump scale right it is either a 1 or a 10 so it went from a 10 to a 1 in the space of about 25 seconds as soon as Justin Trudeau said something that Trump didn't like then I went to a 1 right then Justin Trudeau was a cheat and a liar right now kim jeong-hoon is a wonderful dude but the minute Kim jong-un screws president Trump then presumably he becomes a cheat and wire a little Rocket Man again you know there's something to the idea that President Trump does have the capacity to swivel on a dime and so Kim jong-un does not fulfill his oaths here than president Trump swivels on him but still there there's something deep wrong about saying that a man who has 25 million people in abject slavery in a slave state and 200,000 people in gulags there are lots of people who said now again the reason that I'm not taking it a little bit more seriously in terms of you know President Trump specifically praising Kim is because he says this crap about everybody so in the same exact interview he was asked about josh Jinping Chou Jinping is the leader of China he's the dictator of China and here's President Trump speaking warmly about the fact that jumping is now president for life incredible guy they just essentially president for life pretty good well it's not pretty good he's the head of the Communist Party there's no democracy in China it's not pretty good music saying moammar qaddafi he's been president there for like 30 years pretty good Saddam Hussein been there for a long time pretty good no of course it's not pretty good but the the predicate to his answer about President Xi is that he thinks that President Xi is a good guy so President Xi's a good guy than everything that he does is good and president from did did exactly the same sort of thing with regard to Vladimir Putin you'll remember during the election cycle who's asked by Bill O'Reilly that Vladimir Putin's a killer and Trump said well we kill lots of people too now this is president Trump's version of realpolitik his version of real politics that will not allow to call anybody out morally because everybody on the world stage is dirty and there's basically just a set of competing interests morality doesn't really take a leading role here it's instead us in a hard-hearted and gimlet-eyed fashion determining what America's interests are right now our interests are in trying to woo North Korea and that means that we have to be really really nice to North Korea I have problems with this particular approach which I will explain in just second first we're gonna have to go for Daily wire calm to subscribe so for $9.99 a month you get the rest of my show live you get the rest of clayvin

Michael Shermer the editor of skeptic magazine we talk about God in atheism he's a militant agnostic / atheist and I of course am a very religious human and so we will have a conversation all about religion and God and freewill and politics it's really fascinating I think you'll really enjoy it so go check that out we're the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so the going perspective seems to be that when President Trump says stuff it's just him saying stuff so if president from says nice stuff about Putin yesterday whatever he says stuff because as I've said before he's a dude who says a lot of stuff you know president Trump says many a thing and I mean that could frankly go on his epitaph I mean well you know after 120 years when the president when the president finally has a gravestone then you know it will it could say on in Donald Trump the man said a lot of things okay because that's president from shake and I think everybody in the United States has learned to discount these things but on the international stage people don't automatically discount what it is that you are saying they take what you were saying a lot more seriously and so when President Trump starts praising dictators it gives dictators a feeling they can get away with things and the way that you know this is that Barack Obama did exactly the same thing with Iran and Iran proceeded to get away with things Barack Obama did the same thing with Vladimir Putin Putin proceeded to get away with things George HW Bush by the way did the same thing with Putin when he said that he looked into pooty pooty eyes and he saw his soul and then Vladimir Putin promptly decided that he was going to invade Georgia right the neighboring country of Georgia hey that that the dictators bad people aggressive people they tend to react to warmth as though that warmth is a sign of weakness I like too much better when President Trump was being aggressive now here's something that I'll point out if you were very family font of when President Trump was being aggressive I'm not sure how you are very fond of when he is not being aggressive anymore I mean to the extent that he's not being aggressive so for example President Trump when when he was meeting with Kim trouble in this video just came out it was revealed actually by the by the North Korean media which is just wonderful and it is a picture of President Trump saluting a North Korean general right now you recall when when President Obama bowed before the Saudi kings and everybody went nuts right I was one of the people who said like what the hell is this when President Obama bowed to I think as the Japanese president Japanese premier and everybody went nuts like why is he running around the world kowtow into people well here's the President of the United States who instead of shaking the hand of this North Korean general is going up for the salute like you shouldn't be saluting generals of Tim Pok dictatorships who keep their people in abject poverty and slavery that's it's not a good idea now again the under the the argument is that this is all pragmatism then in the end moral signaling doesn't matter I don't think that's true the reason I don't think that's true is because one of the things that helped bring down the Soviet Union it was the fact that we had something called Voice of America in Europe for folks not all that familiar with the history but something called Voice of America in Europe in the Soviet Union you were forbidden from listening to Western media you could not get Western media you couldn't see Western papers you can listen to Western radio so we had basically bootlegged radios into the Eastern Bloc into the Soviet bloc and then we would broadcast Voice of America and we would talk about how Great America was and how terrible Soviet Russia was and how Soviet Russia was repressing you and if it weren't for Soviet Russia your life would be so much better part of that was designed to let people on the other side know that we were on their side right to let people who were living under this dictatorship know that we are on their side if you're in North Korea there are a lot of bootleg radios in there and a lot of like pieces of technology in North Korea wouldn't be good to know that the President of the United States is not fomenting your dictatorship that the President of the United States is trying to weaken that dictatorship now the president can't openly say that but at the very least the president shouldn't be praising the dictator it does have an impact on the people who are living inside the country it also has an impact on the other countries in the region which are now being told essentially that they should not isolate North Korea any longer they should preemptively D isolate North Korea and this is somehow going to fix things now I guess the question is what do you think is the most realistic possible outcome here if you think the most realistic possible outcome is the liberalization of North Korea into a quasi China state then maybe all of this works out even so I'm not sure why you need the the fawning language from President Trump even though I don't think president Trump means it I think President Trump as I said this is how he negotiates he flatters you in flatters he flatters you until you say no which point clubs you but but if your goal here is sort of the liberalisation of North Korea I gotta I gotta admit I'm not a huge fan of this grand strategy typically I understand the strategy maybe maybe it's the best strategy that's available but I'm not a huge fan the reason I'm not a huge fan is because I'm not sure that Nixon made the right decision in actually liberalizing China because I'm not sure China was liberalized right China is me more powerful threat on the world stage today than they were in 1970 in 1970 they were a poor rogue state run by Mao Zedong who had murdered 40 million of his own people and we proceeded to engage in tremendous amount of commerce with them that may have liberalized their economy and may have gotten some people out of poverty which all of which is good but the Communist Party is still running the place as a repressive dictatorship maybe the better strategy would have been to do to China exact what we did to the Soviet Union which is you cut them off at the knees you you are belligerent you build up your arms you suggest that you're not going to allow them to expand their sphere of influence and then you wait for them to collapse from with it maybe it turns out that by giving money to dictatorships you're actually strengthening the dictatorships I see the arguments both ways I'm not gonna say that my argument is dispositive or that my argument is is the only one that's being made and maybe president Trump is totally right and I'm totally wrong on all this time will tell I will say however I do not think that it is appropriate or decent for the President of the United States to speak to the way that President Trump does about dictators even though I get it he's president Trump and he says this kind of stuff about virtually everybody okay so meanwhile and the media has been responding to President Trump's criticism president Truong has been going after the media he tweeted out the other day that the worst enemy of the United States were the mainstream media a statement which I I agree with that the media are a problem I think that we have worse enemies than Wolf Blitzer I just I think the kim jeong-hoon is a worse enemy to the United States than like Jake Tapper but Wolf Blitzer the fact that the media feel the need to defend really demonstrates why the media are blowing it so here's Wolf Blitzer trying to explain that he is not your worst enemy a lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that is a really really an awful situation we are not the enemy of the American people we love the American people if you have to assure people that you love them that means that you haven't done a good job right if I have to constantly be reassuring my wife then I'm not her enemy that I love her our marriage will end very soon okay so it's good to say I love you to your wife unsolicited all right it's good to demonstrate your love to your wife unsolicited but if your wife says you're a jerk and you hate me and you're garbage and you say no honey I'm not I don't hate you I love you is that really an effective tactic it turns out that probably you've blown a lot of your credibility already the reality is that the media have have blown their credibility in a pretty significant way over and over and over and president Trump when he picks on the media all he's really doing is signifying to them once again that that they do not have the trust of the American people the only way they're gonna win back the trust of the American people is to cover things in an objective fashion which apparently they refuse to do okay meanwhile party infighting is breaking out on both sides of the aisle the Republican Party is having an going gun battle between the the so-called establishment the so-called anti-establishment I find this battles sort of confusing in the sense that Trump is the establishment he's the President of the United States he's the most powerful man on planet earth and the idea that if you don't like some of his policies that somehow you're now pro-establishment is bizarre to me you know I always defined establishment there's this fungibility about some of the political language that I find deeply stupid so here for example when people say establishment I always took establishment to mean too willing to work with the other side to conciliatory to willing to promote leftist policies not in alignment with conservative values that was establishments made that's how I always took establishment I didn't take establishment to mean you know anti X politician because that's just weird that's not what establishment means but it seems like establishment has been turned into an an all-purpose club to wield against virtually anybody so for example Corey Stewart he says that his victory in the in the Republican primaries in Virginia shows that the establishment is going the way of the dodo bird Corey Stewart probably will lose to Tim Kaine in Virginia he has a long history of hobnobbing with with sort of all trite figures a lot a lot of Republican Party politicians are not in love with Corey Stewart for I think a lot of very good reasons here's Corey Stewart saying the establishment is going the way of the dodo bird it's a Republican establishment once they you know continue to oppose to oppose the president myself and others who support them on those things are going to go the way of the dodo they're going to disappear and rising a part of the Republican Party is the trunk established and sorry the the Trump support the Trump base that's what's taking over and that's me the new Republican Party they the old yard the establishment can either get on board or they're going to have to get out okay the establishment is Trump okay Trump runs the party he runs it with a pretty iron hand okay Ron oh the the head of the GOP right the head of the RNC is a Romney McDaniel right Rhonda Rhonda McGraw Romney McDaniel and she came out the statement yesterday right she actually tweeted out in pretty incredible terms I don't know I want to find her exact weight so that I can read it to you because it's pretty astonishing so Rhonda McDaniel who you'll recall actually used to call herself around a Romney McDaniel men Trump asked her not to use her maiden name Romney because he found it insulting and so she and so she just changed it on behalf of the President to the United States which if that doesn't show you the power of President Trump I'm not sure what does she tweeted this out yesterday she tweeted out here it is sorry let me grab it she tweeted out that if you do not follow President Trump complacency is our enemy anyone that does not embrace the donald trump agenda of making America great again will be making a mistake anyone who doesn't embrace the the trumpet listen I love a lot of the Trump agenda I think a lot of the Trump agenda is just great I've been very very positive about president in Trump's political agenda for the last year and a half I've said that I think that it's the most conservative year-and-a-half of governance I've ever seen but I'm not a fan of this whole you know Donald Trump is is the king and we must all bow before him because I'm not the fan of doing that with any politician I think we ought to praise him when he does something good we ought to criticize him when he does something bad but if the idea is that he is not the establishment I'm not sure where you are getting that so we have all of these terms that have now been twisted to mean whatever people want them to mean so that's the fight inside the Republican Party meanwhile the Democrats continue to be as stupid as they possibly can a Democratic candidate has now run one of the most painful and yet hilarious campaign ads in history the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives in Colorado's name is Levi Tillman he's run against Jason crow he says that he says that the best way to stop school shootings is to armed schools and teachers with pepper spray and in his campaign ad he sprays himself with pepper spray to show how effective this strategy would be I'm calling on Congress to stop talking past each other and try something new empower schools and teachers with non-lethal self-defense tools like this can of pepper spray this will stop anyone in their tracks and then he sprays himself in the eyes with pepper spray and then he has to dunk his head in vats of chemicals to stop it and then he described how terrible is is there's more than 300 million guns in the United States as this guy's now soaked in soap I'll go to the for kids in community not Washington insiders operations and I was running a hose over his eyes non-lethal school defense is part of the solution I hope the Democrats continue to run on these platforms forever and never stop doing it all Democrats please spray pepper spray in your eyes to own the own the cons my goodness gracious so never problems we're having inside the Republican Party at least we're not spraying ourselves in the face with pepper spray in or demonstrate that our agenda is apparently superior well done Rando Colorado Democrat my goodness I mean it's almost literally cutting off your nose to spite your face it's literally blinding yourself in order to demonstrate that President Trump is wrong about guns well just pretty amazing stuff okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so the thing I like today I was on a plane yesterday because I'm doing my show from Dallas today where I'm speaking of CPUSA events and and I was able to watch a movie called the death of Stalin now I will admit when I saw the preview for death of Stalin I was not necessarily enthralled because I thought this is gonna make light of the Soviet Union I thought that what it was going to do was it was going to make light of one of the most monstrous regimes in the history of the world and instead instead the movie is spectacular I think it is the best movie that's been made in maybe the last five years it really is that good here's a little bit of the preview our general secretary is lying in a puddle of indignity he's feeling a well clearly I want to make a speech my father's funeral but no problem technically yes but practically when I said no problem what I meant was no problem ignore me Stalin would have wanted the committee as well all those in favor Thierry okay so the preview makes it look like just an outright comedy the the opening scene of the the opening scene of the film like the first three minutes of the film is taking place at a concert where Stalin calls the the head that the person who is the head of the the radio broadcasting facility and they're playing a Mozart piano concerto and he calls up the guy and then he says I want a recording of this and it turns out the guy has not been recording it and so he forces everybody back into the theatre essentially at gunpoint and then makes them replay the entire concerto and applaud because he doesn't want to be shot by Stalin I mean the opening scene of this is Stalin with all of his cronies handing out death lists and people being dragged out of their apartments and shot so the the comedy is that mean is a darker than dark comedy and the whole point of this is that everybody who is there was just an evil evil him being these were evil human beings and that the cult of personality is really dangerous if you want to understand what North Korea really looks like then this is actually a pretty good indicator right better than sort of the overt silly comedy of Team America you wanna know what North Korea really looks like watch the death of style and that's probably what more of Korea is is most like the movie is tremendous I can't recommend it highly enough all the performances are just terrific and I mean well they did not pull their punches I mean this movie does not pull its punches what what it what a terrific film so go check that out the death of Stalin I believe it's available on Amazon right now ok time for a couple of things that I hate okay so nature magazine right which is one of the most prominent and prestigious journals in science has now run an editorial calling for diversity in science why you might ask do the skin colors and sexual orientations of scientists matter aren't we mostly interested in the objective verifiable and replicable results of experiments no shut up you bigot what we're mostly interested in is whether you're doctors black or not that's what we're really interested in so the editorial says lab groups departments universities and national funders should encourage participation in science from as many sectors of the population as possible it's the right thing to do both morally and to help build a sustainable future for research that truly represents society listen I'm fine with more scientists of all ilk we need more scientists we need more people who know what they are doing and researching and making the world a better place but then they say this okay that remember this is in a science journal quote a more representative work force is more likely to pursue questions and problems that go beyond the narrow slice of humanity that much of science is currently set up to serve so in other words if you have a black set of researchers that are going to research different questions than white researchers did they present any evidence for this whatsoever of course not here's their example widening the focus is essential if publicly funded research is to protect and preserve its mandate to work to improve society for example a high proportion of the research that comes out of the Western world uses tissue and blood from white individuals to screen drugs and therapies for a diverse population yet it is well known that people from different ethnic groups have different susceptibility to some diseases okay that's idiotic what you're now suggesting really is that we should take into account more minority groups when we do the research into tissues and blood samples but that doesn't say you need a black doctor to do it and that's like saying that we need more dog and dog is used in experiments than rats used in experiments and we need more dog doctors i what what what again this is a scientific journal and has nothing to do with with anything but science has gone by the wayside and the truth is that a lot of science is just not real okay so the best example of this that I can talk about today is there's this fascinating fascinating story when something called the Zimbardo the Zimbardo experiment it's called the Stanford Prison Experiment you probably heard of it if you took psychology 101 in college you know about this in Bardo experiment what it was is tilt the sky philip zimbardo is in the early 60s I believe he took a group of volunteers and he separated them into prisoners and guards and then supposedly what happened is that the guards just by being labeled guards and the prisoners by virtue of being prisoners the guard started basically torturing the prisoners and after six days they'd shut down the experiment because the guards had become vicious brutal horrible guards and the prisoners had been tortured you know beyond the pale well it turns out the entire experiment was a fraud according to an article at medium from that in Ben bloom this was all nonsense basically the people who are acting as the prisoners say they faked their breakdowns for the cameras that they were that they were shouting and screaming and protesting because it was all not real and the guards themselves were being told by the scientists in charge that they needed to act as brutal as humanly possible so for example one of the guards a guy named Ava Schulman explained quote I took it as kind of an improv exercise I believed that I was doing what the researchers wanted me to do and I thought I'd do it better than anybody else by creating this despicable guard persona I'd never been to the south but I used a southern accent which I got from Cool Hand Luke so Zimbardo lied about all of this he did before Congress actually he testified before Congress at the request of the House Committee on the judiciary and he said the guards were quote simply told that they were going to go into a situation that could be serious and have some danger they made up their own rules for maintaining law order in respect this is untrue he told them exactly how to act his grad students told them exactly how to act now the reason this experiment was supposedly important is because what it supposedly taught you is that just as a normal human being you wore a sadist right you were put in the right situation you would have become a Nazi camp guard and force people into the chambers that is not true okay what this experiment actually suggests and what similar experiments like the famous Milgram experiment suggest is that human beings in order to be brutal have to buy into an idea of a higher good which they are serving if you that we tend to treat each other as ends in normal individual life right when we meet each other on the street but when we have a higher purpose depending on what that higher purpose is we start treating each other as means or obstacles to that end which is really really dangerous stuff and the Milgram experiment which is sort of similar as an experiment where again scientists brought in a group of volunteers and then they separated them into two groups one was going to be the subjects of an experiment and one was one with the experimenter now what the people in the volunteer group didn't know is that everybody who was selected to be the volunteer group for the for the experiment the subjects of the experiment all of those were actors who had been hired by the experimenters and the people who are supposed to be testing those actors those were the volunteers so the way that it works is they would put the actors in a room and then they would have the volunteers who are now the experimenters turn a dial that was supposedly sending a an electrical shock to the actors if they got questions wrong and the scientists would stand over the shoulders of the various people who are administering the shocks and they would say to them you know for the sake of science we have to find out whether you know if you if you torture people they are going to give answers like if you torture people they'll give better answers they'll learn faster and even when people are screaming and pleading for help supposedly according to the Milgram experiment people continue to shock those people now the problem the Milgram experiment was not replicable there are a bunch of different groups some of them like 70% of them would shock people some of them 20% would shock people or 10% or 5% it widely varied how did it vary it depended how many people in the group believed in the usefulness of the experiments itself believed in the value of the scientific discovery being made in other words it's going to be kind of difficult to get people to be Nazi prison guards unless they are Nazis it's kind of difficult to get people to be Josef Mengele unless they believe that they are forwarding the cause of Nazi racial science so what this means is be very careful about the causes that you pick be very careful about the tribe that you choose because if you're not careful then you end up treating people not as individuals but as widgets that you can manipulate and harm for whatever purpose is necessary your own practical interests you not outweigh the rights of others and do not outweigh your the necessity to be decent to individual human beings it's a warning to everybody on all sides of the aisle ok we will be back here tomorrow with much much more I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben
