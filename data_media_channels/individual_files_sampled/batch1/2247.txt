forever21 is notorious at stealing other designers outfits there are rumors that forever21 designers have gotten kicked out of fashion week because they're so blatant about taking a photo off the runway and then you see it two weeks later in the store forever21 is willing to rip off so many designers because it's easy and it's been working you will get something from Diane von Furstenberg and then all of a sudden you'll see it at forever 21 in the exact same print the exact same cut in the exact same style the only difference is quality so basically what forever21 is going around doing is saying I like how that looks let's rip it off and sell it to the masses it's very difficult in fashion to successfully win a lawsuit when somebody's copied your design because the u.s. is really bad about trademarking fashion just because copying other people's designs is so common in the business it's really really tough to win a lawsuit against forever21 right now forever 21 sometimes just under the table just settles things they're like you know what we can afford to do it here's a bunch of money and just don't tell anybody about it the profits are outweighing any litigation costs they face they've been running this business for a while and they're very successful so it's very likely that they're very prepared to continue doing this forever 21s customers don't care about the ethics of it they just want designs they want cheap designs they just want to look good many millennial women don't have a lot of money many millennial women have a ton of student debt and they still want to look hot so they're still gonna go to forever 21 I feel like I've outgrown it I used to shop there in college I stopped shopping at forever 21 when I realized that I was not forever 21 I'm wearing forever 21 right now so I think it's safe to say I'd still shop there
