00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,000
Ma Baoli, better known as Geng Le,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,320
is one of the four Grand Marshals leading New York’s Pride Parade this year.

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,079
But in the country he comes from, being gay is still a social taboo.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,120
The CEO of a Beijing-based internet company

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,140
is on a mission to improve the lives of millions of gay men in China.

6
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,440
Ma’s company Blue City runs an app and a website specifically for gay men.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Blued is one of the biggest gay social networking apps in the world,

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,460
with an estimated 30 million registered users.

9
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,260
Unlike most other apps, Blued is more than just dating or hookups.

10
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,340
Back in 2000, when Ma studied at a police school in northern China,

11
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,560
he realized he didn’t feel like everyone else.

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,520
After visiting some foreign websites with different attitudes to homosexuality,

13
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,040
Ma created his own site for a Chinese audience, encouraging people that...

14
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,760
Even though attitudes towards homosexuals are slowly changing in China,

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,740
it’s still a social stigma.

16
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,560
The virtual world of Blued, where members can be open about their sexuality,

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,480
is for most a striking contrast to their real lives.

18
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,800
This is livestreaming, a function added to Blued in late 2015,

19
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,860
right as the Internet craze was starting to take off in China.

20
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,840
Many self-made stars like Jin make decent amount of money

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,760
by receiving audience’s virtual currencies and gifts.

22
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,720
For Kyle and Klaus, a couple who have come out,

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,580
livestreaming on Blued means something different.

24
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,020
The government's rules for "acceptable" content online may shift quickly in China,

25
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,620
with LGBT materials in a grey area.

26
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,660
Many companies feel the chill of the recent Internet crackdown,

27
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,080
but Blue City still runs as usual.

28
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,960
Ma has won the Chinese government’s trust by helping with HIV prevention among gay men.

29
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,300
A third of the company’s staff are dedicated to screening pornographic and politically sensitive content.

30
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,440
In the past five years, Blue City has grown from a team of seven people

31
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,400
to a promising business with about 250 staff.

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,820
Ma said the company earned over $15 million last year

33
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,840
mainly through advertising and selling virtual currencies to livestreaming audience.

34
00:04:13,840 --> 00:00:00,000
Now the company is expanding overseas.
