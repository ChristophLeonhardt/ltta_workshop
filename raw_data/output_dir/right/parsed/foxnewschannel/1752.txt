SAID THE MOVE SUPPORTS AND
ENCOURAGES MORE PARTICIPATION
WHICH ULTIMATELY WAS ALWAYS THE
GOAL.
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
YOU'RE WITH MORE
AINSLEY EARHARDT AND MIKE.
AND CAT TIM, FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR.
I SAID CHEERLEADING REJECTS ALL,
IS THAT TRUE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YEARS AFTER YEAR AND FOR SOME
REASON IT DIDN'T WORK.
I DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A PSYCHO
MOTHER FREAKING OUT.
>> Martha: DON'T YOU FEEL BAD
FOR THIS KID WHOSE MOTHER RAISED
HOLY HELL AND EVERYBODY'S GOT TO
BE ON THE TEAM.
>> CONGRATULATIONS TO THIS MOM
BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER HAS NO
FRIENDS WHATSOEVER.
YOU TALK ABOUT MEAN GIRLS.
SHE WILL SEE ME AND GIRLS IN
ACTION BECAUSE THIS MOTHER
TAKING THINGS TO A WHOLE
DIFFERENT LEVEL AND ABSOLUTELY
BEING CRAZY ABOUT IT.
THE ENTITLEMENT SOCIETY SIDE OF
IT, WE ALL EXPECT THINGS TO BE
HANDED TO US.
>> Martha: THIS IS NOT HELPFUL
MOM.
>> I WAS A CHEERLEADER IN
SEVENTH GRADE.
EIGHTH GRADE I TRIED OUT AND I
WAS CUT FROM THE TEAM.
BROKEN HEARTED, CRIED, SO UPSET.
MY DAD COMES UPSTAIRS, HE SITS
ON MY BED AND HE SAYS SOMEONE
ELSE NEEDED THAT SPOT.
YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH, GOD
CREATED YOU TO BE STRONG ENOUGH.
WE WERE GIVING UP YOUR SPOT TO
ANOTHER GIRL WHO MIGHT NOT BE
STRONG ENOUGH CAN TAKE IT.
THAT WAS SUCH A VALUABLE LESSON.
>> Martha: AND YOU SAID NO,
DAD, I WANT THE SPOT AND YOUR
MOM WENT AND GOT IT FOR YOU.
>> I THOUGHT WOW AND MY DAD
TOTALLY TURNED IT AROUND AND
SPUN IT WHERE I GOT INTO THAT.
THAT'S GOOD.
>> AND YOU ARE SOMEHOW OKAY NOW.
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO RECOVER.
>> Martha: ALL BECAUSE YOU GOT
CUT FROM THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD.
>> I WAS CUT FROM THE
CHEERLEADING SQUAD AND I WAS SO
BAD THAT I REALLY HAD SOME NERVE
TO EVEN WASTE ANYONE'S TIME BY
TRYING OUT WHATSOEVER.
BUT I JUST, INSTEAD, JOINED THE
MOCK TRIAL TEAM AND HAD SOME FUN
THERE AND WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO
PURSUE SOMETHING AS GOOD AT
RATHER THAN ALLOWING MYSELF TO
EMBARRASS MYSELF BY
SOMERSAULTING UP ON THE FOOTBALL
FIELD BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T EVEN
DO A CARTWHEEL.
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR
ANYONE.
>> WHERE THOSE KIDS ARE SO BAD
ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
>> Martha: I WAS A CHEERLEADER
FOR LIKE A LONG TIME.
MIDDLE SCHOOL, ALL THROUGH
HIGH SCHOOL.
WHEN I HAD MY DAUGHTER I HID MY
CHEERLEADING PICTURES BECAUSE I
KNEW THAT IF SHE SOUGHT SHE
WOULD BE LIKE, I WANT TO BE A
CHEERLEADER AND I DIDN'T WANT
HER TO BE A CHEERLEADER.
I WANTED HER TO BE ON MOCK
TRIAL, WHICH SHE DID END UP
DOING AND SHE BECAME AN ATHLETE
AND A SOCCER PLAYER AND ALL THIS
COOL STUFF BECAUSE, HONESTLY, I
THINK THEY SHOULD DO AWAY WITH
CHEERLEADING.
I WAS THE HEAD OF THE FORCE.
YOU STAND ON THE SIDELINES AND
YOU CHEER FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
IT'S LIKE GET OUT THERE AND DO
IT YOURSELF.
WHO NEEDS TO LEARN TO DANCE?
I WANTED TO LEARN --
>> I'M STILL TRYING TO LEARN.
>> Martha: I WAS TOLD THAT FOR
THE CHEERLEADERS BECAUSE WHEN I
WAS A CHEERLEADER I ACTUALLY
THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE WATCHING OUR
ROUTINES.
THEY ARE NOT WATCHING YOUR
ROUTINE.
THEY ARE WATCHING FOOTBALL.
THEY ARE WATCHING BASKETBALL AND
IT'S LIKE THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD
ONE.
WE DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.
PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK.
>> THESE ARE FROM A STORY FROM
FAILURE, OBVIOUSLY WE WILL ALL
FAIL IN LIFE BUT MICHAEL JORDAN
GOT CUT FROM HIS FRESHMAN
HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM.
MICHAEL JORDAN, THE GREATEST
PLAYER OF ALL TIME.
HE GOT THROUGH IT.
AND IT JUST MAKES YOU STRONGER
AND BETTER.
>> INCLUSIVENESS IS GREAT, BUT
IT DOESN'T CHANGE REALITY.
JUST BECAUSE THEY ALLOW EVERYONE
TO MAKE THAT YOUR LIMITING, THAT
SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE
STILL A BAD CHEERLEADER.
YOU ARE JUST LETTING EVERYBODY
ENOUGH.
>> DO YOU THINK WHEN THEY WILL
LOOK BACK AT THESE VIDEOS AND
SAY I WAS CRYING AND TWEETING.
>> Martha: OF COURSE THEY ARE,
WHICH IS WHY THEY SHOULD BE
PLAYING SOCCER OR BASKETBALL,
BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL FEEL GOOD
ABOUT -- THEY WILL FEEL SO MUCH
BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES.
AINSLEY IS GOING TO COVER THE
ROYAL WEDDING AND YOU ARE
LEAVING TONIGHT.
>> I'M LEAVING TOMORROW NIGHT.
>> Martha: I DID THE LAST ONE.
POOR MEGHAN MARKLE.
HER FATHER APPARENTLY PAID THE
PAPARAZZI TO TAKE PICTURES OF
HIM GETTING MEASURED FOR HIS
TUXEDO AND LOOKING AT A COMPUTER
SCREEN AT STARBUCKS.
THERE HE IS.
HE WAS LOOKING AT PICTURES OF
HER AND HARRY ONLINE AND
EVERYTHING AND IT TURNED OUT
THAT IT WAS A PAPARAZZI DEAL
THAT HE MIGHT'VE EVEN MADE SOME
MONEY OFF OF AND NOW HE'S NOT
GOING TO THE WEDDING.
>> YOU DON'T NEED THAT KIND OF
DRAMA ON YOUR WEDDING DAY.
PROBABLY GOT ENOUGH DRAMA HAVING
SUCH A FAMOUS WEDDING BUT TO
HAVE YOUR DAD TO SOMETHING LIKE
THAT, I WOULD BE SO MAD AT MY
DAD.
>> IT'S A LACK OF TRUST ALREADY.
FROM THE BEGINNING, FROM THE
ONSET WITH THE MOST FAMOUS
COUPLE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
I'M JUST VERY DEPRESSED THAT I
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE WITH
MEGHAN MARKLE ANYMORE.
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT HARRY?
ALL THOSE GIRLS.
WHEN WE DID WILLIAMS WEDDING,
THEY GAVE UP HIS LITTLE PENS
THAT SAID DON'T WORRY, YOU CAN
STILL MARRY HARRY BECAUSE
WILLIAM WAS GONE.
YOU'VE GOT A STORY NOW.
THIS WILL BE VERY INTERESTING.
>> I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.
I'M HAPPY FOR HER BECAUSE SHE
HAS THE ULTIMATE CINDERELLA
STORY.
IT'S AMAZING WHAT SHE'S BEEN
THROUGH AND HOW FAR SHE'S COME
AND EVERYONE, EVERY BOOK I'VE
READ IN EVERY ARTICLE I'VE READ,
SHE WAS A HARD WORKER AND SHE
REALLY DESERVED THIS AND SHE
SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PERSON.
BUT HER DAD TO DO THIS, HER
BROTHER WOULD SEND MESSAGES TO
HARRY, DON'T DO IT.
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE
CINDERELLA STORY BECAUSE SHE HAS
THE FAMILY.
THE DAD IS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY
OR HIS FRIEND IS THE
PHOTOGRAPHER MAKING MONEY.
THEY COULDN'T FIND THE TAILOR.
THEY WENT UP TO SOME KID AND
SAID WILL YOU ACT LIKE YOU ARE
THE TAYLOR?
>> THEY GAVE HIM A MEASURING
TAPE.
>> Martha: HER MOTHER SHOULD
WALK HER DOWN THE AISLE.
THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE
FOR HER AND HER MOTHER IS
LOVELY, SHE'S GOING TO BE THERE
AND SHE SHOULD WALK HER DOWN THE
AISLE.
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU GUYS HERE.
