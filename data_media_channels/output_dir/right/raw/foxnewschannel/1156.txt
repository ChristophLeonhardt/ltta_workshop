28
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:00,386
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE HAD

29
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:01,454
SOME CALIFORNIA DELEGATES COME

00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,590

35
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:14,767
YOU NEED TO CHANGE HER NAME.

36
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:20,373
THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE, THAT WAS

37
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,442
UNACCEPTABLE TO ME.

38
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:24,477
AND, DID YOU CALL THESE PEOPLE

39
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:27,380

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,850

42
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:38,391
I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY NAME,

43
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,692
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE

44
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:40,994
WITH THIS NAME WILL NOT HAVE A

45
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:41,794
CHANCE.

00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,596

47
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:46,366
EXCELLENT CLEAN CAMPAIGN AND WE

48
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,400
DID VERY WELL.

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,302

00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:54,007
COUNTRY AND YOU LIKE TO BE

54
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:54,874
SOMEONE THAT HEALS THOSE

55
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:55,241
DIVISIONS.

56
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,176
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS PART OF

57
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:11,557
YOUR MESSAGE PROBLEM AS FAR AS

58
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:14,627
YOUR MESSAGE PROBLEM AS FAR AS

00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:15,728
DISTRICT?

61
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:16,195
>> I LOVE THAT.

62
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:16,929
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SUPPOSED

63
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:17,497
TO BE THE PARTY OF THE

64
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,197
UNDERREPRESENTED AND THE PARTY

65
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:18,731
OF THE MARGINALIZED.

66
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,365
DURING THE COURSE FOR OUR

67
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:20,099
CAMPAIGN WE KNOCKED ON THOUSANDS

68
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:20,800

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,534
THING WAS A RECURRING THEME, THE

70
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:22,201
UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES

71
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:22,935
WERE NOT GETTING ANY ATTENTION,

72
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:23,369
POINT BLANK.

73
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:23,936
SO PARTY DOWN LIKE TO HAVE PARTY

74
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,673
UNITY YOU NEED TO REACH OUT TO

75
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:27,774
THE HONOR MARGINALIZED.

76
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:28,975
YOU NEED -- WE NEEDED TO MAKE

77
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,910
SURE THAT WE HAD ALL RACES AND

78
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,080
ALL CULTURES, THEY ARE A

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,747
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

80
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:36,783
CONSTITUENCY HERE IN

81
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:37,383
ORANGE COUNTY.

82
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,384
>> Martha: YOU BASICALLY HAVE

83
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:40,920
A CIVIL WAR OF SORTS GOING ON IN

84
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,320
CALIFORNIA.

85
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,789
YOU HAVE THEM ARE DUMB LIKE MORE

86
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,390
RURAL AREAS THAT WOULD LIKE TO

87
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,191
SEE MORE CONSERVATIVE

88
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,592
GOVERNANCE, THEN YOU HAVE THE

89
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:49,462
VERY DUG IN, BLUE AREAS THAT

90
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,431
HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH HIGH

91
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,766
TAXES AND PEOPLE FLEEING THE

92
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:54,200
STATE.

93
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,036
HOW WOULD YOU WORK TO PULL IT

94
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:57,470
BACK TOGETHER?

95
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,372
>> I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

96
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:01,674
MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT

97
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:06,879
REPRESENTATION BACK INTO YOUR

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,980
REPRESENTATIVE.

99
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,948
I THINK CONGRESSMAN ROHRABACHER

100
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,183
HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM THE

101
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:10,583
DISTRICT.

102
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,218
THE ONLY TIME HE SHOWS UP IS TO

103
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:13,986
COME TO CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS TO

104
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:14,854
A SPREAD HATE AND DIVIDE THE

105
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:17,156
COUNTY AND THAT'S THE WRONG

106
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:17,490
MESSAGE.

107
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,593
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT

108
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:23,463
ISSUES THAT AFFECT EVERYONE AND

109
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:24,197
EVERYWHERE.

110
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:24,864
HOMELESSNESS, ENVIRONMENTAL

111
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:25,198
ISSUES.

112
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,200
WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT FROM

113
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,969
HIM BUT WE WILL SEE THAT FROM

114
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:30,636
OUR CAMPAIGN FOR SURE.

115
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:31,671
>> Martha: I THINK IT'S

116
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,872
SHOCKING THAT SOME OF THE PARTY

117
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:34,807
OFFICIALS TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE

118
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:35,842

120
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:38,377

00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:40,580
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
