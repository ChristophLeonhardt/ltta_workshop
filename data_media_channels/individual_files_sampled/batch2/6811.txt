so natalie portman you know she was born in Israel mm-hmm and she's very proud of it and she's very proud of Israel and she's a supporter except they were gonna give her this prize the genesis prize and she said I'm not gonna go because of you notice that they were picking off peaceful protesters with sniper fire and immediately they went after her so here's Natalie Portman has fallen into the hands of BDS supporters as the Israel cultural Minister so it can't be that she actually looked at the situation and made a decision it has to be that there's some nefarious people who are controlling her through am a Jedi mind-meld there's something I don't know so here is what Natalie Portman said she said my decision not to attend the Genesis Prize ceremony has been mischaracterized by others let me speak for myself I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony by the same token I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it so that's kind of ironic because what she's doing is she's boycotting the Israel prize right now she's not actually participating she's gonna boycott that abandoned so but she's not boycotting the other stuff she's just this just the thing that has to do her so that's a little bit irony would you say that's irony yes yes I'm not I'm not supporting the boycott but I am gonna boycott they're the big super-duper event you guys had planned for me right so she said it was because of she has liked Netanyahu like many Israelis and Jews around the world I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation I treasure my Israeli friends and family Israel food Israeli food books art cinema and dance Israel was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for refugees from the Holocaust but the mistreatment of those suffering from today's atrocities is simply not in line with my Jewish values because I care about Israel I'm uh stand up against violence corruption inequality and abuse of power please do not take my words that take any words that do not come directly from me as my own this experience has inspired me to support a number of charities in Israel I will be announcing them soon and I hope others will join me in supporting the great work that they are doing so I just find that super ironic all the way through there she's telling you why she's boycotting this event which by the way this event is considered the Israel the Israel's version of the Nobel award yes that's right it's a million dollar prize yes and I think she got she won she got the prize she's not going to a ceremony yes she got the prize and I don't find it to be that inconsistent so she's not in favor the general BDS movement or a boycott everything Israel but she's boycotting this particularly event yeah and you know it's a statement it's in this instance she's making a very public statement that she does I support the current right-wing Israeli government policies but what really frustrates me is that who whenever someone doesn't support the existing right-wing Israeli government that gets conflated to not supporting Israel altogether which is deeply frustrating because there are many Israelis themselves who don't support the right wing government of Israel just the way we don't support the right in government here at home doesn't mean that I don't support America or our America just to to be destroyed I just don't support that kind of right-wing pro-war mentality and you know I'm glad that Natalie Portman is standing up and and someone else did it to the Lord the singer from Australia she refused to perform in Israel because of it and she was accused instantly of being an anti-semitic anti-semite so again you know my frustration with with politics around the issue of Israel and the BDS movement is the conflation of two totally separate things yes not supporting a particular right-wing government versus not supporting that the country the state and a haven for for the Jewish people so this was in the article which I found this was interesting and this is one of my pet peeves the Genesis Prize foundation canceled the Prize ceremony saying in a statement that it it's organisers fear that MS Portman's decision will cause our philanthropic initiative to be politicized something we have worked hard for the past five years to avoid okay just so you guys know there is no such thing as being non-political there is no such thing because if Natalie Portman were to go to that event and receive that prize she would be exactly what she said seen as endorsing the current situation and Netanyahu in Israel that's what she so and if you try to say well I'm not either way that means you are supporting the status quo if you have a platform to speak out and you don't that's a political decision so then trying to say that this prize is non-political there's no such thing as something being non-political if you want your if if you want your kid to go to a good decent school that's politics if you want to be able to see a doctor when you're sick without going bankrupt that's politics if you want to be able to see a doctor when you get sick that's politics if you want the pothole fixed in front of your house that's politics so there's no such thing as being not political if you say I've seen other comedians say well I'm not political I just ID'd jokes about submarine sandwiches and ice cream yeah that's a political decision you're making a decision not to talk about what's happening right now so you don't offend anybody which means you are propping up the stat it's cool if I was a comedian in 1936 Germany and I was doing my stand-up back and it consisted of hey datings crazy huh that would be political decision and I would say I'm being not political are you sick and tired of corporate Democrats as much as we are and you think we can have what the rest of the world has and come watch the aggressive progresses with us on The Young Turks Network
