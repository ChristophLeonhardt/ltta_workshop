1
00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:02,103
>> Sean: GOD BLESS YOU, WE

2
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,504
WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.

3
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,305
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

4
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:06,140
I THINK THERE ARE MORE OF THESE

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,942
CASES WE CAN FIND.

6
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:10,478
GIVE PEOPLE SECOND CHANCES.

7
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:13,181
JOINING US NOW, THE AUTHOR OF

8
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:17,351
THE RUSSIA HOAX, FOX NEWS LEGAL

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,153
ANALYST GREG      GREGG JARRETT.

10
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,355
HE IS WRITING A BOOK, AND THIS

11
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,623
WILL BE A BEST SELLER ALSO COME

12
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,991
UP THEY WILL BE FIGHTING AGAINST

13
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:24,392
EACH OTHER.

14
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:27,695
THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING

15
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,931
TRUMP, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR

16
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,465
ALAN DERSHOWITZ.

17
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,100
I THINK THE BOOKS ARE

18
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,302
COMPLEMENTARY, AND I THINK WE

19
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:36,137
COULD DO IN OUR DEBATE, YOU GUYS

20
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,973
SIGNED BOOKS AND I COULD HAVE A

21
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:39,273
BEER.

22
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,975
>> HAPPY TO DO THAT.

23
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,210
>> LET'S DO IT.

24
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,477
>> Sean: FIRST I HAVE TO ASK

25
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,913
YOU ABOUT THIS WHOLE ISSUE WITH

26
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:46,180
ME.

27
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,449
PROFESSOR DERSHOWITZ, YOU DID

28
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,517
KNOW THAT I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.

29
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,586
>> FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE THE

30
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:52,720
PERFECT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

31
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,322
MAKE THE COMPARISON.

32
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:57,558
I AGREE WITH IT, THAT'S A

33
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,192
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

34
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:58,759
ARGUMENT.

35
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,561
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DID IT WITH A

36
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,797
SENSE OF SARCASM SAYING, LOOK AT

37
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,397
WHAT SHE DID, BUT YOU WON'T GET

38
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,302
AWAY WITH IT IF YOU DON'T DO IT.

39
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,103
DO IT.

40
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:09,503
IT'S ABSURD.

41
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,338
>> Sean: I HAVE LAWYERS THAT

42
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,106
WILL TAKE ME ON AS A CLIENT

43
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,375
RIGHT HERE.

44
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,643
>> YOU WOULDN'T NEED US.

45
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,678
I COULD FIND YOU A FIRST-YEAR

46
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:18,646
STUDENT THAT WOULD WIN THAT

47
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:19,080
CASE.

48
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,949
>> Sean: HOW DO THESE PEOPLE

49
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:22,717
GET ON AIR?

50
00:01:22,717 --> 00:01:23,184
THAT'S CRAZY.

51
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,986
>> I SUSPECT THE PEOPLE THAT

52
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,087
WERE CRITICIZING YOU NEVER

53
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,723
ACTUALLY LISTENED TO WHAT WAS

54
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:29,890
BEING SENT TO.

55
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,692
I PLAYED THE FIRST CLIP, SOMEONE

56
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,893
SAYING A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER

57
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,695
SHOULD BE ORDERED AGAINST YOU.

58
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,697
IF THAT GUY HAD A LAWYER, HE'S

59
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,900
AS DUMB AS A BUCKET OF HAIR.

60
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,503
OBVIOUSLY SATIRE AND PARODY AS A

61
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,704
PROTECTED SPEECH.

62
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,273
SARCASM DOES NOT CONSTITUTE

63
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,274
INCITING A CRIME.

64
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,943
MOST PEOPLE ARE YOU FOR THAT

65
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,479
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE

66
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,079
TALKING ABOUT LEGALLY.

67
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,481
WE WANT EVERYONE AT HOME, YOU

68
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,484
JUST SAW WHY THESE BOOKS WILL BE

69
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,318
BEST SELLERS.

70
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,988
ALL RIGHT, THE DOJ, THERE WAS A

71
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,491
SPY, PROBABLY TWO OR MORE.

72
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,526
YOU ARE A CONSTITUTIONAL

73
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,494
ATTORNEY, CONGRESS HAS A

74
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,695
CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN

75
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:08,696
OVERSIGHT.

76
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:09,497
CHECKS AND BALANCES AND

77
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:10,298
SEPARATION OF POWERS.

78
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:13,067
WHY WON'T THEY TURN THE

79
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:13,701
DOCUMENTS OVER?

80
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,902
>> THEY SHOULD.

81
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,238
I'M A CIVIL LIBERTARIAN THAT

82
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:17,838
GOES BACK TO THE ANTIWAR

83
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,707
MOVEMENT WHEN INFORMANTS WERE

84
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,309
PUT IN THE ANTIWAR MOVEMENT.

85
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,177
THEY WERE PUT IN THE

86
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,313
ANTI-MARTIN LUTHER KING MOVEMENT

87
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,113
ANTI-MARTIN LUTHER KING MOVEMEN

88
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:26,714
MOVEMENT.

89
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:27,381
>> Sean: MARTIN LUTHER KING

90
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,483
WAS SPIED ON IN A HORRIFIC WAY.

91
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,885
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

92
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:31,986
SO AS A CIVIL LIBERTARIAN WHEN

93
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,890
YOU PUT SOMEONE IN A CAMPAIGN,

94
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,958
YOU'LL WANT TO SEE THE

95
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,492
JUSTIFICATION.

96
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,226
MAYBE THERE WAS JUSTIFICATION,

97
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:43,097
MAYBE IT WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL,

98
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,899
BUT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS THE

99
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,133
RIGHT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT

100
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:46,901
THAT.

101
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,870
>> Sean: THIS IS A SCARY TIME.

102
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,306
LISTEN, I AM AS

103
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,708
PRO-LAW ENFORCEMENT AS ANYBODY.

104
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,110
I LOVE -- MY MOTHER WAS A PRISON

105
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,477
GUARD.

106
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,845
MY DAD WORKED IN PROBATION.

107
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,980
IT WAS A BIG DEAL, ALL OF MY

108
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,016
FAMILY, MANY OF THEM MORE POLICE

109
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,719
AND TWO MAY BE FBI AND THAT WAS

110
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,154
THE TOP OF THE HILL.

111
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,522
>> I NEVER PASS A POLICEMAN IN

112
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,424
THE STREET WITHOUT THANKING HIM.

113
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,360
I ALWAYS DO IT.

114
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,761
FIREMEN, POLICE, SCHOOL

115
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,128
TEACHERS.

116
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,964
PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD TO GIVE US

117
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:17,732
PROTECTION OR EDUCATION, I WANT

118
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,601
THEM TO KNOW I APPRECIATED EVERY

119
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:24,271
>> Sean: I DO THE SAME.

120
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,306
SO, THEY WON'T HAND IT OVER AND

121
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,274
THEN YOU HAVE ROSENSTEIN'S

122
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:27,608
COMPLEX.

123
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,510
I'M THINKING, THEY PROMISED TO

124
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,945
HAND IT OVER, WHY?

125
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,248
>> CONGRESS HAS EVERY LEGAL AND

126
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:34,915
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SEE

127
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:35,883
THESE DOCUMENTS.

128
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,952
THOSE SEEKING IT ACTUALLY HAS

129
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,587
SECURITY CLEARANCE, THE GANG OF

130
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:39,920
EIGHT.

131
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,789
SO THERE IS NO LEGAL

132
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,924
JUSTIFICATION FOR HOLDING IT AND

133
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,359
YET THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

134
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,727
THE FBI HAVE A LONG AND

135
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,162
DISTINGUISHED RECORD OVER THE

136
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,831
LAST YEAR OF CONCEALING EVIDENCE

137
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,300
OF REDACTING RECORDS UNDER

138
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,101
NATIONAL SECURITY TERMS.

139
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,670
THEN WE FIND OUT WHEN THEY ARE

140
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,938
UNSEALED, THERE WAS NO SUCH

141
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:58,539
THING.

142
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,708
WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND HOWEVER

143
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,876
IS FOR CONGRESS TO IMMEDIATELY

144
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:02,610
WRITE TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

145
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,879
AND SAY, DO NOT DESTROY A SINGLE

146
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,179
DRAFT.

147
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,114
WE WANT TO SEE WHAT THE ORIGINAL

148
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,516
LOOKED LIKE, WE WANT TO SEE

149
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,184
EVERY CHANGE, WE WANT TO KNOW

150
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,986
WHO CHANGED IT, WHY IT WAS

151
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,488
CHANGED AND WHEN IT WAS CHANGED.

152
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,322
>> AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

153
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,291
WOULD HAVE IT.

154
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,627
>> YOU CANNOT TRUST A BRIEFING

155
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:20,293
AS TREY GOWDY SAID.

156
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,562
THEY ARE JUST TELLING YOU WHAT

157
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,497
THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH AT THE

158
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,031
BARE MINIMUM.

159
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,934
YOU HAVE TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS

160
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:27,334
THEMSELVES.

161
00:04:27,334 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: I HAVE TO GO, BUT
