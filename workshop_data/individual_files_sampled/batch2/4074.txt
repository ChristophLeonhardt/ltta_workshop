based on the excerpts does what you've heard from the author and what you've read does it as a job with your experience in the White House absolutely what we're seeing are these themes emerging you see these themes about his mental stability about his ability to comprehend complex policies his ability to lead also how he treats his staff and how he responds to threats Donald Trump is dangerous and that is the consistent theme whether it's commies book Wolf's book Wars book or my book unhinged you you've also said that you don't think you're the only person who's on staff that has tapes I know that for a fact yeah you have you seen or heard some of the other tape sir well I don't want to expose the person but I had an exchange with a reporter last year and we had a tape of that exchange it was in the press secretary's office and someone another staffer had recorded it for me I didn't know that they did just to push back on that reporter who lied and said certain things happen and didn't but there was another staffer who actually recorded that exchange not me so they're not really to look out for one another particularly when you were talking to different meeting members of the press who work a bit competitive there was a tape that was released a short time ago over on the view and I do want to play it for our viewers and listeners who may not have caught that can you set this particular tape up for us what are we going you've heard about Donald Trump what kind of wandering around the West Wing with not much to do he would drop in on very key meetings and just start rambling and talking gibberish and here you'll hear him blaming Hillary Clinton for Russia and this would this was when this was October of 2017 ker let's take a listen somebody told me hope you told me it was nine million dollars they spent on that yes nine million dollars did you see nobody knows who spent it go ahead it was done I was 5.7 but nowadays it was never spent to a law firm that way they can't trace it but if they traced it one thing in this business a trace the reason the buffer misgives this way you don't have to give any measurements but they can it's definitely illegal that it's illegal from the campaign's that point for many campaign finance so the homework that I think seems to have turned around the look on your face it is bizarre at a number of levels to hear President Trump talk about a possible violation of campaign finance law and that's one of the things that he is precisely being looked at violating and it would also seem that perhaps there is some sort of conversation that that some might consider is an obstruction of justice yeah how often would something like that happen the president would just roll in and start talking about Hillary or Russia or something like that quite often and then at the end of this 15-minute rant he made everyone in the meeting get up and come and stand around the Oval Office for another 25 30 minutes and it would be essentially an extension of what we just heard that's right and we had to be his audience until he released us to go back doing the important work that the American people expected us to do oh I want to go back to this op-ed because you've said that you think that the op-ed writer is Mike Pence's chief of staff Nicky Ayers correct yes why well I went back and looked at all of the emails that came out of the vice president's office specifically that came from Nick Ayers and just a consistent pattern particularly with all the communications from his senior staff and so I suspect it came from that direction where choice you know yes and even tone you think we'll know at some point or do you think this is I don't think we'll know you don't think we'll ever know I don't I think that the New York Times will protect their source hopefully because if they don't Donald Trump will stop at nothing to destroy this person they'll never ever work in Washington DC again that hasn't happened to you he's tried he just he can't defeat me I know too much and I know too much of his tactics hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
