WAS BOB AND MIKE AND ORRIN. THAT'S A STRONG NUCLEUS, BUT WE HAD A GREAT TEAM. WE ARE DOING VERY WELL IN TERMS OF THE SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA. LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING ALONG VERY WELL. AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MEETINGS GOING ON AS WE SPEAK IN A CERTAIN LOCATION WHICH I WON'T NAME. I LIKE THE LOCATION. IT'S NOT SO FAR AWAY FROM HERE. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF GOODWILL. I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THE MEETING AND GET SOMETHING DONE. IF WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE CORE REYAB PENINSULA, IT WOULD BE A GREAT THING FOR NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA. IT WILL BE GREAT TORE JAPAN AND THE WORLD AND UNITED STATES. GREAT FOR CHINA. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORK ON IT. IT'S MOVING ALONG NICELY. WE ARE LOOK AT JUNE 12 IN SINGAPORE. THAT HASN'T CHANGED.
