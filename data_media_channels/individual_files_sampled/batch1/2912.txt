there's no magic sleep position but there are a few things you should know about different sleep positions first of all sleeping on your stomach is probably the worst out of the three because sleeping on your stomach puts undue stress and strain on your neck and lower back if you can rig yourself up with pillows to adjust that that may help your alignment but ultimately it's probably going to be hard to stay comfortable on your stomach all night long sleeping on your back is best for spinal alignment when you end up sleeping in odd positions you can end up with a lot of pain and stiffness that will affect you throughout the day and also could affect your sleep as well however sleeping on your back puts you at risk for snoring and snoring really really impacts your sleep quality both your own and everyone around you so if you do snore then sleeping on your back is probably not the best for you side sleeping is best in terms of keeping your airway open if you have sleep apnea or if you snore side sleeping can be an issue for spinal alignment you can remedy that by sleeping with a pillow between your knees to align your hips properly and often that's that's all it takes to correct that issue
