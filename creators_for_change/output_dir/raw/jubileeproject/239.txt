21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,640
individual communities could be

00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,050
generation they're going to be in

32
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">control of the world so definitely if</font>

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,910
would really be to travel to orphanages

38
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,979
around the world and help

39
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,490
underprivileged kids can one person make

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,979
a difference i think if one person tries

41
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,380
to change him or herself I think that

42
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">can make a difference inside you've got</font>

43
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,550
enough work to do be a big or little and

44
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,980
by focusing on that rather than focusing

45
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,510
on other people judging other things

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,930
criticize another thing

47
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,700
being the change that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,490
you create positive ripples even if it

49
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,410
is one parcel eats it let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread one</font>

50
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,260
by one around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world all you have to</font>

51
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,460
do is give somebody like a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

52
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,320
your day or time like anybody if you see

53
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,669
somebody on the street you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like go</font>

54
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,410
say hi to that it just really could

55
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,820
change the other day and it's just as

56
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,190
amazing it's really cool I think it's

57
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,930
simple just if sometimes it just takes

58
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,030
maybe 20 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your life to just do</font>

59
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">something sit with a kid read a book</font>

small you never<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everybody has our</font>

64
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,950
own talents and I think that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,959
together we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely make a</font>

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,070
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> one person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on their own</font>

67
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,810
