first remember this from 11 days ago because NATO nation media have arguably already forgotten about it for RAF Tornado bombers taking off from a criterion Cyprus on a mission to punish the Syrian regime for its use of chemical weapons this evening I have authorized British Armed Forces to conduct coordinated and targeted strikes but what of the suspected chemical attack in eastern guter joining me now from Aleppo in Syria is its Member of Parliament Forrest J hobby who is also chairman of the Syrian Federation of industry fires thanks for joining us before we get to other matters presumably you're predictably going to say that the Assad government was not responsible for any chemical attack in duma definitely definitely because it's a clear hoax many Western journalists went there and they broadcast from there and with their Rhodes articles from there plus the 13 hospital clinic of duma where they were the videos the original videos were shown all denied there was ever an attack including doctors and and medical clerks in the indeed the same hospital so all evidence point that there was nothing and the most important thing is our troops were nearby were metres away and we declared victory in the same area that means there's there was no need to use any extra force and including chemical weapons that we already don't have as the OPCW itself said two months ago well obviously we're in no position to verify what you say we've got to wait until the OPCW makes its decision although of course Britain says it definitely was a chemical attack which is why they took their action you presumably believe it's a violation of the UN Charter does that give the Syrian government the right to attack Britain because of in the name of the UN Charter in terms of self-defense yes I mean presumably yes because how can Britain and France and McCrone now we call it the French poodle of the White House how could he attack us in violation of international law and on the eve of the of the chemical inspection team arrival to Damascus I mean before they start working before they started inspecting inspection they just attacked us this is we don't live in a jungle it's you know the earth and the the the whole world is not only United States and everything else it's just the backyard certainly in the past 24-48 hours the Israeli government the British backed Israeli government is now saying it will attack Syria again if the Syrian government uses Russian defensive technology against missile strikes what did you think about your leader position just this is just pure Israeli arrogance let's let's wait and see let's wait and see if we if we get these you know defense systems and they attack us and then we will escalate I mean we these these missile systems are to defend ourselves then then we don't we don't want to get them to attack other people there are there are surface to air defense systems so basically and we've had it with the Israeli assaults on us many of many of these assaults took place to help these be various jihadi groups on the ground every time we go to an area to liberate an area against al-qaeda or Isis once we are waiting then then the second day or the third day or even the same time we've seen an Israeli strike somewhere so basically the Israelis they have to be taught a big lesson not to attack us anymore I mean we found a couple of planes a month ago and we are willing to escalate we have nothing to lose we have nothing to lose in anyone but Israel and everything to gain we are willing to escalate and we are ready to escalate with this Israeli Israeli cowards that just attack us from a distance if you want to really go to war we are ready to go to war and guess what when we go to a war we've been in a war for six six years now seven years now what are you going to do are you going to live in shelters are you going to live in bunkers for a long time let's let's wait let's see let's wait and see you see that that's all very well and I would say that even in London that's growing recognition that your government has been victorious against the NATO proxies in your country why did it take so long them well it took so long because we had we have like 250,000 jihadi mercenaries from a hundred men from a hundred nations they pouring in in waves wave after wave after wave I mean it's a miracle that we're still you know together with Finland or with standing as a country ninety percent of the population lives in government control areas it's a miracle how we could withstand this terror gets better I solve this federal war supported by NATO on our sport now eight year consequently as I say given that there's recognition that you're winning time now to look at the strategic mistakes your government made because let's not forget that your president was arguably sucking up to the British government shortly before this war began huge strategic blunders by your government as it tried to pivot towards the West we don't want to we really don't want to rush or lean towards the West anymore we have to be more balanced in our international relationship we have to really appreciate you know the help that we demand us help and cooperation we've received from our real friends in in Russia in Iran in China in many other countries more than half of the world actually and we have to really focus on strengthening our relationships with these countries instead of really trying to please the West you know the traditional colonial powers in the West what was wrong with the elite classes in Syria that they somehow thought that NATO nations allied to Israel would forget Syria's role in protecting Palestinian rights against those perceived to be Israeli interests well they actually did not think that they just tried to modernize the country economically by by having some cooperation with Western countries it was all about economics it wasn't it wasn't like we're trying to really so liberate the Golan Heights or solve the Palestinian cause by you know being friends with the with NATO countries and I guess even this equated austerity didn't it because you implemented neoliberal reforms that are yes led to the breakout of this absolutely absolute revolution against your government absolutely and actually actually the list also as chambers of industry we were against this rapid liberal reforms and we have to do it more in a balanced way more slowly we have to focus on the distribution of wealth we have to focus on economic and social development in the rural areas and we have to focus on local production whether industrial production or agricultural production instead we we previous governments rushed to liberalize the the economy according to you know World Bank formulas that's really they just do harm with and not one single good came out of them before you even get back to that kind of reconstruction of course they'll have to be surely some sort of Truth and Reconciliation committee or are they just going to be massive death penalties against those that the Assad government believe people trying to destroy Syria actually you know it's it's not as simple as this we don't want to we you know we want to heal the wounds now we want to do a reconciliation we learned from our mistakes the hard way the hard way and I hope we learn from our mistakes and we have to really move forward in a peaceful beneficial way that every everybody in Syria has to be a winner the most important thing is by winning the really reconciliation and reconstruction rebuilding war and most importantly rebuilding the human being rebuilding the people the you know our inner peace our love for each other this is the real war this is the real battle and it's it's it's coming up do you think you'll take it live back in yes yes every inch of it yes every inch of it we will take it back it live now is worse than then Afghanistan was ever it's a small area clustered with jihadi mercenaries from all over the world not only Taliban or al-qaeda will you have mercenaries from all over the world with different ideological backgrounds not only like one colored or one-dimensional ones like we saw in then Afghanistan no this is multinational the numbers are so big clear and you know liberating a blip and cleansing a blip is should be should be a world task I mean and if you want to do it then we should be appreciated work internationally because we are doing the world a huge favor by doing this see when you say cleansing how are you going to liberate it and I've got to ask this question did the Syrian government ever use chemical weapons during these past seven years against even if we won't accept that they were foreign-backed proxies did the Syrian government ever use chemical weapons never never even when we had chemical weapons even before dismantling our chemical weapons when we had them in our also we never use them against these proxies actually they were used against us in 2013 a colossal 20 kilometers from Aleppo and we are the ones who went to the Security Council and and demanded an inspection to go to Aleppo to inspect the use of chemical weapons under the of course the the approval and support of the Turkish government as you know British the British prime minister doesn't accept it and believes that Russia was in some way involved with this and actually you triangulated over your chemical weapons program there was no Russia at the time in 2013 the Russians came in September 2015 I'm talking about the incident of 2013 we lost more than 20 soldiers due to chemical weapons that were used against our soldiers and civilians of Haarlem in Aleppo and we are the ones who submitted the first claim and requested please come inspect that these jihadi groups that you call moderate rebels are using chemical weapons bear in mind we don't have Holi powers to control the wind directions and we live in an intense popular highly intensely populated areas and our troops are everywhere so it's not really smart to use chemical weapons to to hurt our soldiers and our civilians and just finally your reaction to the Kremlin saying that they have to look again at supplying the Syrian government now with the most advanced defensive missile defensive technology in the world and whether it will protect you in case Saudi Arabia and Israel and perhaps Britain United against and airstrikes your way we really hope we really hope that the Kremlin supply us with not only with s-300 but we need the s400 as well because we were victims of a terror war for now ages now we are entering the eighth year of this war and Israeli Air Force and the so-called coalition air force and all of all of this is a threat to our security is a threat to our people and we need to defend ourselves this our our god-given right and our international right to defend ourselves well she happy thank you you walk
