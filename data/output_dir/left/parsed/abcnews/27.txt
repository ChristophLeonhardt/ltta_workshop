>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> BREAKING NEWS WHAT APPEARS TO
BE A DEADLY INCIDENT IN TORONTO,
CANADA, AROUND 1:30 EASTERN 
TIME, DRIVER IN A WHITE VAN, 
MAJOR THOROUGH FARE, PULLED OFF 
THE THOROUGH FARE, MOWING DOWN 
PEDESTRIANS.
YOU SEE THE WHITE VAN THERE, THE
SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY, NOT 
BEFORE PLOWING DOWN EIGHT TO TEN
PEDESTRIANS ACCORDING TO TORONTO
POLICE.
EYEWITNESSES ON THE SCENE SAID 
THAT IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE 
SEVERAL CASUALTIES, SEVERAL 
FATALITIES FROM THIS INCIDENT.
NO MOTIVE YET, BUT AS WE SAID, 
THE TORONTO POLICE SAY A SUSPECT
IS IN CUSTODY, HAS BEEN TAKEN 
FROM THE VAN.
TO OUR CHIEF JUSTICE 
CORRESPONDENT PIERRE THOMAS.
PIERRE, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
MOTIVE WAS, WE DON'T KNOW WHY 
THIS DRIVER DECIDED TO PULL OFF 
THE ROAD AND GO DOWN THE 
SIDEWALK, BUT WE DO KNOW THIS 
FITS A PATTERN. 
>> IT DOES, GEORGE.
U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 
OBVIOUSLY ARE TRYING TO GET 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT 
THIS SITUATION IN WHICH ALL 
THOSE PEDESTRIANS APPEAR TO HAVE
BEEN INJURED, GEORGE.
WE HAVE HAD INCIDENTS INVOLVING 
VEHICLES USED AS WEAPONS IN NEW 
YORK CITY, IN LONDON, IN PARIS.
OTHER ATTACKS LIKE THIS, GEORGE.
 OBVIOUSLY THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW 
THE MOTIVATION YET, TERRORISM IS
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE LOOKED 
AT.
>> PRESUMABLY JUSTICE OFFICIALS 
IN THE UNITED STATES ON ALERT 
NOW. 
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO GET 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
WE'RE UNDERSTANDING IN NEW YORK 
CITY, POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS PUT 
OUT A TWEET INDICATING THEY'RE 
MONITORING THE SITUATION VERY 
CAREFULLY.
GEORGE, WHEN YOU HAVE THIS MANY 
CASUALTIES IN THIS KIND OF 
SCENARIO, IT SENDS UP ALARM FOR 
PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE. 
>> YOU SEE THE SCENE IN TORONTO 
RIGHT NOW.
EMERGENCY OFFICIALS ON THE 
SCENE.
THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAJOR 
THOROUGH FARE IN DOWNTOWN 
TORONTO.
YOU SEE THE SHOES, PERHAPS OF 
SOME OF THE VICTIMS.
STORES, CONDOMINIUMS, AND IN 
FACT A FEW MILES AWAY, FOREIGN 
MINISTERS FROM THE MAJOR G-7 
COUNTRIES HAD BEEN MEETING.
THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE 
FOR THE UNITED STATES JOHN 
SULLIVAN IS THERE FOR THE UNITED
STATES.
WANT TO BRING IN JOHN COHEN, 
FORMER COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIAL
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY, HE IS ON -- JOINING US
BY PHONE NOW AND AS PIERRE SAID,
WE HAVE SEEN A PATTERN HERE.
WE KNOW THAT ISIS HAS CALLED ON 
SUPPORTERS TO USE VEHICLES LIKE 
THIS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.
ISIS AND AL QAEDA HAVE URGED 
PEOPLE IN WESTERN COUNTRIES TO 
USE CARS, KNIVES, ANYTHING THEY 
CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON, AND TO 
CONDUCT ATTACKS AT SO-CALLED 
SOFT TARGETS, PLACES WHERE THE 
PUBLIC CONGREGATES, PLACES THAT 
ARE DIFFICULT TO SECURE.
SO WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
MOTIVE WAS BEHIND THIS ATTACK OR
THIS INCIDENT, BUT YOU CAN BET 
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE 
RAPIDLY TRYING TO, ONE, FIGURE 
OUT IF THIS IS TERRORISM 
RELATED.
AND IF IT IS, FIGURE OUT IF 
THERE ARE ANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT 
ARE WORKING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL.
>> AND PRESUMABLY THIS DID NOT 
SEEM TO BE A SUICIDE ATTACK.
THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN INTO 
CUSTODY A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM 
THE AREA WHERE HE HIT THOSE 
CIVILIANS, JOHN.
>> NO, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT IS 
SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL WHERE YOU'LL 
HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL CONDUCT 
THIS TYPE OF AN ATTACK, 
INITIALLY, AND THEN EITHER KILL 
THEMSELVES OR TRY TO CONFRONT 
POLICE OFFICERS.
SO THIS INDIVIDUAL IS FLEEING 
FROM THE SCENE, BUT THAT SAID, 
IT WAS A RENTAL VAN, IT SOUNDS 
LIKE HE TRAVELED -- THE DRIVER 
TRAVELED QUITE A DISTANCE DOWN A
SIDEWALK STRIKING PEOPLE, BOTH 
IN THE STREET AND ON THE 
SIDEWALK.
AND THE FACT THAT THE DRIVER IS 
ALIVE AND CAN BE QUESTIONED BY 
POLICE AND THEY CAN EXAMINE HIS 
ELECTRONICS, HIS PHONE, HIS 
LAPTOP, ANY OTHER TYPE OF DEVICE
HE MIGHT HAVE BODES WELL THAT 
LAW ENFORCEMENT
>> A DEADLY INCIDENT IN KHAN 
DAWN FOLDED AROUND 1:30 THIS 
AFTERNOON.
EIGHT TO TEN PEDESTRIANS HIT 
ACCORDING TO POLICE BY A DRIVER 
IN A WHITE VAN, WHO MOVED ON TO
