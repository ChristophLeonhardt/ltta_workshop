00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,580
In January 2016, an American college student
was detained in North Korea on charges of

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,019
“hostile acts” against the state.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,169
The student was just leaving the country after
a five day guided tour approved and monitored

4
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:18,880
by the North Korean government.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,730
But although the US has long discouraged travel
to North Korea, roughly six thousand Westerners

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,740
reportedly visit the country every year.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,750
So we wanted to know, how can you get into
North Korea?

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,110
Well for Americans and many other nationalities,
traveling to North Korea is no easy task.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,540
Before 2010, American tourists were altogether
banned from obtaining North Korean visas,

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,350
unless they visited during the country’s
famous “Mass Games”.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,120
Today, most Americans can successfully enter
the country, but only after they obtain a

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,270
visa and book a pre-approved guided tour.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,140
Nearly all flights into North Korea’s capital,
Pyongyang pass through China, which means

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,070
many travelers must get both a Chinese and
North Korean visa for the trip.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,420
Additionally, US citizens are required to
enter by plane, rather than by train or boat.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,630
This process is even trickier for journalists,
who need a special visa to enter North Korea.

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,970
In the rare case that a reporter is let into
the country, they are stripped of their equipment

18
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,140
and assigned a round-the-clock government
chaperone, called a minder.

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,890
Journalists must also surrender all electronic
privacy to the North Korean government, who

20
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,540
are known to monitor emails, phone calls and
internet searches.

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,320
So, it’s no surprise that journalists are
routinely denied entry to North Korea.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,310
In fact, there seems to be no public record
of how many western journalists are currently

23
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,989
working in the country.

24
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,810
But the number is likely low.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,069
Most of the content we see of North Korea
is actually from North Korean journalists

26
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:48,310
working for Western media outlets.

27
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,990
North Korean leaders recently allowed Western
news organizations to operate bureaus in the

28
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,220
country, albeit under very tight regulations.

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,530
On the other hand, traveling to North Korea
is much easier for citizens of communist or

30
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,350
former soviet states.

31
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,739
Moreover, roughly 80 to 90 thousand of the
total 100 thousand annual visitors come from

32
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,149
neighboring China.

33
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,520
The Chinese and residents of 22 other countries
including Cuba, Switzerland and Russia don’t

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,770
need a visa to enter North Korea, however
the length of their stay is usually limited.

35
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,080
Despite the tight restrictions and invasive
policies aimed at foreigners, North Korea

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,700
sees more Western tourists every year.

37
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,320
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un publicly endorsed
tourism in 2013, saying that he’d like to

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,820
see at least one million visitors a year by
2020.

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,180
Since then, the country has unveiled a five-star
ski resort and has been slowly turning an

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,200
industrial port into a tourist beach resort.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,550
Still, the average North Korean vacation takes
months of planning and for US citizens, costs

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,580
roughly $2,000 dollars.

43
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,110
So the Hermit Kingdom is making strides in
terms of opening up their historically secure

44
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,110
borders.

45
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,930
However the US State Department has cautioned
against traveling to North Korea, due to a

46
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,190
higher risk of long-term detainment, for something
even as little as taking a photo.

47
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,240
With all the costs and bureaucratic hurdles
in place, not to mention the danger of being

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,850
imprisoned, traveling to North Korea could
be more trouble than it’s worth.

49
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,280
While it isn’t clear just how much money
tourism brings into North Korea, it certainly

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,790
isn’t their biggest moneymaker.

51
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,910
In fact, with so many sanctions and unfriendly
relations around the world, just how does

52
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,130
North Korea make its GDP?
