1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,100
“I started gymnastics in 1976.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,930
I loved it.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,670
And I had a certain
aptitude for it.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,700
I was a national team
member for eight years.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,520
And I was a national
champion in 1986.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,090
I think it’s dangerous
to assume that we

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,200
have a one guy problem with
Nassar and that with him gone,

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,770
the sport is now safe,

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,320
and these girls are now safe.”

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,170
More than 250 women
have come forward

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,710
to say they were sexually abused
by former U.S.A. Gymnastics doctor

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,600
Larry Nassar.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,650
The scandal has highlighted
what many gymnasts

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,640
say is a culture of
abuse within U.S.A.G.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,550
“The standard and the
expectation if you want to win

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,310
is an environment that
is rife with physical

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,950
and emotional abuse.

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,450
And I think this creates
the conditions where

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,250
sexual abuse can occur.”

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,000
U.S.A. Gymnastics has complaint
files on 54 coaches

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,930
from 1996 to 2006, according
to documents obtained

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,580
by The Indianapolis
Star.

23
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,560
For decades, U.S.A.G.
empowered itself

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,000
to investigate complaints
before deciding whether

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,750
to contact law enforcement.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,950
Former U.S.A.G. president 
Steve Penny once said in a deposition:

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,580
“To the best of my
knowledge, there

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,500
is no duty to report if you are a
third party to some allegation.”

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,830
These gymnastics coaches
were accused of sexual abuse.

30
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,313
Here’s how U.S.A. Gymnastics
handled their cases.

31
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,480
Don Peters led the
U.S. women’s team

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,160
to a record breaking eight
medals at the 1984 Olympics.

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,980
“The head coach of the
American women’s team

34
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,770
is Don Peters, one of the most
respected men in gymnastics.”

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,400
In 2011, three gymnasts told The
Orange County Register

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,960
that Peters had
sex with them when

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,760
they were teenagers in the '80s.

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,430
Peters was banned for
life by U.S.A. Gymnastics

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,470
two months after the
report was published.

40
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,985
He was also removed from
the Sports Hall of Fame.

41
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,810
Marvin Sharpe was the
U.S.A. Gymnastics 2010

42
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,460
coach of the year.

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,600
U.S.A.G. got a detailed account of
abuse involving Sharp in 2011,

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,490
but it wasn’t
until a 14-year-old

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,480
came forward in 2015 that the
federation contacted police.

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,699
Sharpe was arrested
in August 2015

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,360
and committed suicide in his
jail cell one month later.

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,730
Stephen Infante was a popular
coach in New England gymnastics.

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,630
In 1997, gymnasts accused Infante
of having sex with them when

50
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,630
they were teenagers.

51
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,780
After an internal investigation

52
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,610
U.S.A. Gymnastics barred
Infante for life,

53
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,780
but the organization
didn't go to the police,

54
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,480
and Infante continued coaching
girls at gymnastics summer camps.

55
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,230
Infante was charged with raping
one of his former athletes

56
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,830
a decade later and
was convicted in 2010.

57
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,430
Last year, a nonprofit called
the U.S. Center for SafeSport

58
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,800
was put in charge of
preventing and handling abuse

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
in Olympic sports,

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,340
and in the wake
of the Nassar scandal

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,660
the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board
has been forced to resign.

62
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,610
Many athletes and
victims of abuse

63
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,010
say these actions are
too little, too late.

64
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,900
And some wonder if
it’s truly enough

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,520
to transform a
culture that failed

66
00:03:02,520 --> 00:00:00,000
to protect its young women.
