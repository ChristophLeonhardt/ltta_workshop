A 64-YEAR-OLD ALBANIAN MAN
WHO BECAME A U.S. CITIZEN BACK
IN
2010 WAS TRAVELING BACK TO
ALBANIA WITH CASH.
THERE IS A
LOT OF CORRUPTION AND FRAUD
WITHIN THE ALBANIAN BAKING
SYSTEM AND THE CURRENCY RATES,
EXCHANGE RATES ARE HIGH SO HE
DECIDED TO TRAVEL BACK WITH CASH
AND HE WAS PLANNING ON HELPING
FAMILY THERE.
WHILE HE WAS
TRAVELING WITH THE MONEY IN HIS
CARRY-ON LUGGAGE, TSA FLAGGED
HIS LUGGAGE AND FOUND THE MONEY.
HE HAD A PRETTY LARGE AMOUNTS
OF CASH, $58,000 IN CASH IN ALL
$100 BILLS.
HE ALSO HAD THE
BANKING WITHDRAWAL RECEIPTS TO
PROVE THAT THAT CASH DID NOT
COME FROM ANYTHING ILLEGAL OR
DRUG TRAFFICKING BUT IT DID NOT
MATTER.
THEY HAVE 
YET TO CHARGE HIM
WITH ANY CRIME AND THIS IS
EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING PEOPLE
IN AMERICA GO THROUGH WHEN
AUTHORITIES PRACTICE SOMETHING
KNOWN AS CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE.
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE PROVEN
GUILTY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
CHARGED WITH A CRIME.
IF YOU
ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PROPERTY
OR CASH THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN ANYTHING ILLEGAL,
THEY CAN TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU
AS PART OF THEIR INVESTIGATION
AND IT IS VERY UNLIKELY YOU WILL
GET THE MONEY BACK.
IN FACT, IF
YOU DO, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS VERY
DIFFICULT SYSTEM TO PROVE
THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT.
YOU ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN
INNOCENT AND THAT IS WHAT
HAPPENED TO THIS MANTRA.
HE HAS TO PROVE THAT HE IS
INNOCENT OF NOTHING BECAUSE
THERE WAS NOT EVEN A CRIME.
HE WASN'T CHARGED WITH
ANYTHING.
HE DIDN'T EVEN DO THE ONE
THING THAT THEY USUALLY USE AS A
TECHNICALITY WHICH IS YOU HAVE
TO DECLARE THE GUILT AND
THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH YOU.
HE
HAD A LAYOVER IN NEWARK BEFORE
HE LEFT THE COUNTRY, THAT IS
WHEN HE WOULD'VE HAD TO DECLARE
SO THEY DIDN'T EVEN LET HIM FILL
OUT THE FORM AND THEY SAID, HE
WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO CONCEAL
THE MONEY.
NO, HE LITERALLY
LAID OUT IN HIS BACK VERY
CLEARLY IN FACT WITHIN THERE AND
LABELED THEM.
HE DIDN'T CONCEAL
IT AT ALL.
THEN AFTER THEY GET
THIS NOTICING HEY, CAN YOU GIVE
US THE MONEY BACK THEY SAY NO,
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS
INVOLVED IN SMUGGLING OR
DRUG TRAFFICKING OR MONEY
LAUNDERING.
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.
AND THEN THE FAMILY WAS LIKE,
WHICH ONE?
LITERALLY.
YOU JUST LISTED A BUNCH OF
OPTIONS, DO YOU HAVE
EVIDENCE OF ANY OF THOSE THINGS?
NO, AND THEN BY THE WAY, THIS
FAMILY FOLLOWED EVERY SINGLE
PROCEDURE AND LAW THAT YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO GET THE MONEY
BACK SO BY LAW, THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO RETURN THE
MONEY AFTER A 90 DAY PERIOD AND
THEY WERE LIKE NO, WE'RE
JUST NOT GOING TO.
THE GUY
WAS WORRIED ABOUT THEIVES IN
ALBANIA, PARTLY WHEN HE WAS
WITHDRAWING THE BANK, THEY
WAIT FOR YOU AND THERE'S A
LOT OF CRIME THERE.
WHEN HE DIDN'T KNOW IS IN
AMERICA THE GOVERNMENT IS THE
CRIMINALS AND SO WHEN YOU GO TO
THE AIRPORT, BEFORE YOU GET
TO DEPOSIT IN ANY BANK IN
ALBANIA, WE ARE GOING TO
ROB YOU OF YOUR MONEY.
SPEAKING OF THIEVES, THE
NUMBER THAT THEY DECLARED IS
ABOUT $700 SHORT THAN WHAT HE
TOOK WITH HIM.
EVEN IF HE GOES
THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND SPEND
ALL THIS MONEY TO GET HIS MONEY
BACK, IT IS GOING TO BE $700
SHORT.
CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE IS
SUCH A BIG ISSUE.
IN 2017
ALONE, THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES
SEIZED $2 BILLION.
THAT IS
SIMILAR TO THE AMOUNT THAT
BURGLARIZED RESIDENCIES HAVE
AMOUNTED TO, BUT THE OTHER THING
WHICH MAKES ME REALLY SUSPECT OF
THE AUTHORITIES IS THAT THEY
GAVE HIM OPTIONS AND ONE OF THE
OPTIONS WAS THERE IS A
COMPROMISE OFFER.
IF YOU SAY
THAT YOU WILL GET LESS MONEY
THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU SOME OF
THE MONEY BACK SO THAT ACTUALLY
MEANS THAT HE DID NOT DO
ANYTHING.
IT IS A SOURCE OF REVENUE NOW
FOR THE FEDS AND FOR STATE
POLICE AND CITY POLICE OFFICERS.
THIS IS BIG GOVERNMENT 
AND IT
IS ROBBERY.
