IF THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEOLOGY AND

56
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:31,621
NOT PUBLIC POLICY, IT'S BECAUSE

IT IS THEOLOGY.

OTHER SIDE IS TRYING TO CONVERT.

75
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,518
YOU CAN BE THE LIBERAL IN AN

76
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:03,720
ARGUMENT, BUT YOU CAN EVER

77
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,723
CONVINCE THEM THEN YOU WON.

78
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:08,624
HE CARES MUCH MORE DEEPLY THAN

79
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:09,359
YOU AND THEREFORE KNOWS HE'S

80
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:09,925
RIGHT.

81
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:11,928
NOTHING CAN CONVINCE THEM

NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL

00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:47,730
DE BLASIO KNEW THIS?

>> TO ME IT WAS JUST KIND OF --

107
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:57,473
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN OPEN

108
00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:57,840
SECRET.

109
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,042
I HAD HEARD STORIES AND RUMORS

110
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:03,312
ABOUT SCHNEIDERMAN FOR YEARS.

111
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:04,614
I'D BEEN TOLD BY AT LEAST THREE

112
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:08,885
OR FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE SINCE

113
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:13,890
MAYBE 2009 THAT HE IS INTO ROUGH

114
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,492
SEX WITH WOMEN, THAT HE LIKES TO

115
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:17,226
DATE STAFFERS AND IS A LITTLE

116
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:20,730
PUSHY WITH THEM, THAT HE TRIED

117
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,266
TO KIDNAP A REPORTER AND

118
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:27,270
WOULDN'T LET HER OUT OF HIS CAR

119
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:30,306
TAKING HER TO HIS APARTMENT.

120
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:32,575
SO I SORT OF ASSUMED THAT THIS

121
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:33,810

122

IF YOU RAISE A REALLY GOOD, I

145
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:15,351
IT?

146
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:18,120
>> IT SEEMS IMPLAUSIBLE TO ME.

147
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,322
IMPLAUSIBLE TO ME THAT ANY

149
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,659
NEW YORK STATE HADN'T HEARD IT.

150
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:28,130
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN SAY.

151
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,400
ANDREW CUOMO HAS BEEN STEEPED IN

152
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,970
NEW YORK STATE POLITICS FOR 40

153
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,270
YEARS.

154
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,306
HE BASICALLY HAS A PRIVATE ARMY.

155
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:40,443
HE KEEPS TABS ON EVERYTHING AND

156
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:41,310
EVERYONE.

157
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,112
HE'S EXTRAORDINARILY PARANOID.

158
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:44,313
>> Tucker: I KNOW.

159
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:45,948

161
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:49,385
EVERYONE IS UP TO AT ALL TIMES.

162
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,586
>> Tucker: HE'S A THOROUGHLY

163
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:51,053
BIZARRE PERSON.

164
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:52,188
I'VE DEALT WITH HIM.

165
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,322
THAT'S EXACTLY THE WORD THAT

166
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:55,224
COMES TO MIND AND I DON'T USE IT

167
00:04:55,224 --> 00:05:05,101
LIGHTLY, HE'S PARANOID.

168
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:05,701
THIS IS STRANGE BECAUSE

169
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:06,235
SCHNEIDERMAN WAS THE

170
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:06,736
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

171
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:07,470
IT WASN'T JUST SOME FUNCTIONARY.

172
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,170
HE JUST WASN'T THE NIGHT CITY

173
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,804
EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS.

174
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:09,438

THE SUGGESTION THAT HE KIDNAPPED

177
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:11,507
SOMEBODY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT

178
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:12,608
ONE OF HIS PEERS WOULD FOLLOW UP

179
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:12,909
ON IT.

180
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:16,913
>> YOU MIGHT THINK SO.

181
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:19,916
AT THE SAME TIME, NEW YORK STATE

182
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:20,583
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS UNIQUE

183
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,818
POWERS AND IS AN IMMENSELY

184
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:23,286
POWERFUL FIGURE.

185
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:25,788
I DON'T THINK ANY

ATTORNEY GENERAL -- ANY STATE

187
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:28,190
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACROSS THE
