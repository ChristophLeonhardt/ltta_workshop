00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:23,514
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE.

188
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:24,381
IN HIGH SCHOOL OR OTHERWISE.

189
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:27,985
I AM NOT QUESTIONING AND HAVE

190
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,087
NOT QUESTIONED THAT PERHAPS

191
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,189
DR. FORD AT SOME POINT IN HER

192
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,891
LIFE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY

193
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:35,593
SOMEONE IN SOMEPLACE BUT WHAT I

194
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:36,827
KNOW IS THAT I HAVE NEVER

195
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:39,296
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE.

196
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,264
I WANT A FAIR PROCESS WHERE I

197
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:43,534
CAN DEFEND MY INTEGRITY, AND I

198
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:44,869
KNOW I AM TELLING THE TRUTH.

199
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:49,273
I KNOW MY LIFELONG RECORD.

200
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:51,542
I’M NOT GOING TO LET FALSE

201
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,611
ACCUSATIONS DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS

202
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:53,611
ACCUSATIONS DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS

203
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:54,478
PROCESS.

204
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,913
I HAVE FAITH IN GOD AND I HAVE

205
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:56,814
FAITH IN THE FAIRNESS OF THE

206
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,684
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

207
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:00,384
>> Laura: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

208
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:05,923
MAY BE FAIR BUT THE DEMOCRATS ON

209
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:05,923
MAY BE FAIR BUT THE DEMOCRATS ON

210
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:07,258
THE COMMITTEE ARE CIRCLING.

211
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,993
>> DOESN’T KAVANAUGH HAVE THE

212
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,862
SAME PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AS

213
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:10,862
SAME PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AS

214
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:12,130
ANYONE ELSE IN AMERICA?

215
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,499
>> I PUT HIS DENIAL IN THE

216
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,533
CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING THAT I

217
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,335
KNOW ABOUT HIM IN TERMS OF HOW

218
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,704
HE APPROACHES HIS CASES.

219
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,406
HIS CREDIBILITY IS ALREADY VERY

220
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:22,173
QUESTIONABLE IN MY MIND AND IN

221
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,243
THE MINDS OF A LOT OF MY FELLOW

222
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:28,546
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THE

223
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:28,546
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THE

224
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:28,913
DEMOCRATS.

225
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,248
>> Laura: SHE GAVE IT ALL THE

226
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:30,715
WAY THERE.

227
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,117
IT’S NOT ABOUT WHETHER THESE

228
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,151
WOMEN HAVE BEEN WRONG.

229
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:37,322
MANY OF THEM PROBABLY HAVE.

230
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:38,857
IT’S NOT ABOUT RESPECTING THE

231
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,891
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE,

232
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:40,325
EITHER.

233
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,927
THIS IS ABOUT DENYING

234
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,095
DONALD TRUMP A FIFTH VOTE ON THE

235
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:44,095
DONALD TRUMP A FIFTH VOTE ON THE

236
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:44,529
SUPREME COURT.

237
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,864
BUT THE DEMOCRATS, I’M TELLING

238
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:46,731
YOU, THEY SHOULD TAKE A BREATH,

239
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,900
AND THEY SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE

240
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,602
NEW STANDARD THEY ARE SITTING

241
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:52,637
HERE FOR ALL NOMINEES GOING

242
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:53,739
FORWARD.

243
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,841
ARE WE REALLY SUGGESTING THAT

244
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:58,577
ALL ASPECTS OF FUTURE DEMOCRATIC

245
00:06:58,577 --> 00:06:58,577
ALL ASPECTS OF FUTURE DEMOCRATIC

246
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,646
NOMINEES, THEIR HIGH SCHOOL AND

247
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:03,081
COLLEGE BEHAVIOR, THAT SHOULD BE

248
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:03,081
COLLEGE BEHAVIOR, THAT SHOULD BE

249
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,250
SUBJECTED TO SCRUTINY AND

250
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,084
INVESTIGATION?

251
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,920
WELL, THAT SHOULD BE LOADS OF

252
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,489
FUN.

253
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:08,320
THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE HELD

254
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,724
THE VOTE LAST WEEK AS PLANNED.

255
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:15,194
KEN STARR SAID THAT A WEEK AGO

256
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:16,061
ON THIS PROGRAM.

257
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,763
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE INDULGED

258
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:18,731
THE CIRCUS.

259
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,233
HAD THEY DONE SO, THE RIGHT WAY,

260
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:21,233
HAD THEY DONE SO, THE RIGHT WAY,

261
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,534
JUSTICE AND KAVANAUGH WOULD

262
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:25,104
ALREADY BE SETTLING INTO HIS NEW

263
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:25,104
ALREADY BE SETTLING INTO HIS NEW

00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:25,838
CHAMBERS AT THE SUPREME COURT.

265
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:29,675
AND A WARNING: IF HE IS NOT
