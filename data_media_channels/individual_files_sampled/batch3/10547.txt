ition has sent to state duma legislation adjustments bail it was approved in the first reading next day it's core ID and purposes to ensure sustainability and financial stability of the pension system for the many years to come that means that we will not only be preserving but also ensuring the growth of retirement benefits of today's retirees and the future retirees as well so these are the purposes standing behind this legislation bill which stipulates incremental rise of the retirement age we understand that these issues of our utmost importance for millions of people for every one of us that is why I'm addressing you like this directly because I want to explain and to say what kind of changes are being proposed by the government and outline my own position share my own suggestions and thoughts which are I believe also necessary the discussions over the possible increase of the timeand age started not yesterday started a long time ago back in the times of the USSR then it was discussed in the 90s but no decisions were made it was postponed again and again in the beginning of the 2000s many members of the government and experts of Russia started to discuss this thorny issue because they realized that there will be need to increase the retirement age and there were objective who requisites and demands for that we all know that in 2020 around this year we'll seen a lot of demographic challenges every 20 27 years when people of this age start a family have children we will be having less people of that age than we used to have that happens because of the most challenging demographic losses for instance Second World War this is not only millions of people who died but also millions of people who were never born when one more generation came to life there were the 90s which was also a very challenging time mid 90s back then the country faced a most disastrous social and economic crisis which had catastrophic consequences that led to the second demographic blow to our country we had even fewer children we expected that is a demographic gap of the 90s which is compared to the situation we had during the war times between 1943 and 1944 so this very generation who were born in the 90s is becoming the real workforce they're entering the workforce this is why the burden of the pension system is increasing because it is based on the principle of solidarity which means that the people who work support the retirees our parents our grandparents and they in return when they were working they were paying to help our grand grandparents so you see what the conclusion is we are having not so much working people and we have less opportunities to support the pension system that means we need changes back in the beginning of 2000's I was all against it I said it at close meetings and during public addresses in 2005 during one of the direct lines were the president I said that while I'm a president these is no going to happen that's right what I said exactly the quote then in 2008 when I left my position everything was as it used to be and I believe that back then that kind of position economically speaking was well founded and reasonable in terms of the social securities and guarantees I believe that if we increased the retirement age back in the beginning of the 2000s would have been wrong I would like to remind you of the kind of country we had back then we had low GDP rate low salaries high unemployment and high inflation almost one-fourth of the population lived below the poverty line and the life expectancy was barely above 65 back then in that situation if we increase the retirement age to have better salary some better retirement benefits what would have become of it many people villages and in rural areas of Russia would have lost the only source of income with such high unemployment there would have been no work for people and no pensions and all the possible addition to the retirement benefits would be would have been eliminated by high inflation in other words we would have had a lot more poor people we needed to overcome the Sharks of the 90s ensure economic growth and saddle most phony social issues so what have changed we use this time cautiously and consciously we the people in the country we have been working hard as soon as we ensure the necessary resources basis we started to invest in our social system and our people to implement long-term demographic programs such as the maternity capital program these programs have yielded very tangible results helping us to fight the challenges of the last decades including the demographic one we have overcome the economic problems and starting from 2016 we've been seen only steady growth today the unemployment level is at its lowest since 1991 certainly we need to do a lot more things are to be done in healthcare in many other areas which manifest the quality of life of people and which ensure the longevity of life but also thanks to the measures we've been implementing and thanks to the more reasonable way people are doing we see that today the increase in life expectancy is one of the best in Russia it has increased by eight years in the last 19 years yes many people still tend to doubt statistics statistical data we like what we see and we trust what we see yes some people leave a very long life but some of our relatives or friends unfortunately passed away at an early age this is true but these are things which are objective unbiased this is statistics and it has been supported by the UN the United Nations and by the end of the next decade we are looking to achieve the life expectancy of 80 years so that our people would be a healthy and happy all that I have said it's objective and its analysis its statistics but we need to remember that these changes mean the lives of people they impact the lives and plans of millions of people hundreds of millions some people are planning to retire now spend more time with their families with their grandchildren some would like to continue working having their retirement benefits as an additional income well this is understandable but now these people afraid that these hopes and plans are not going to come true I understand that this is difficult and I share your feelings but let's see what kind of options we have we can put up with the low income waiting for the times when the pension system would collapse or postpone these unpopular decisions so that next generation will have to take them make their choice we should remember that we are caring for the country of today in country of as it will be in 20 years and it changes to the pension system no DVD retirement age and everything else is a troublesome issue for many people and all the political forces first and foremost and the position ones for sure we'll be using the situation to advertise themselves and reinforce their positions well this is a political process and it's the same in any democratic society however I have obstructed the government to most cautiously assess every constructive suggestion and proposal including those which have come from the opposition as for the current government current authorities the easiest way would be to do nothing to sit idly today we all know the challenges we face but the Russian economy is stable we have another resources to support the pension fund the pension system in the upcoming Sen 1 to 10 years will be able to end expansions in due time and view form but we all know that gradually we will spiral down to the times when the government will have no money to support the pension system regular payments of pensions would be a problem it used to be like that in the 90s we remember that look back in 2005 the ratio between the working population okay into the banshan fund and the people who were receiving retirement benefits was one point seven to one while in 2019 it will be one point two to one so almost one to one and if we do nothing we see it oddly we will not be able to preserve our pension system and maintain the pensions as the yarv today's retirees and tomorrow retirees and the pensions will be going down as well as the ratio to the salaries and we all know that diamond benefits are quite moderate today and they are not comparable to how much these people contributed to their country we owe our retired citizens these changes will allow us not only to preserve the current living standard but also ensure that the pensions will be rising at an advanced space in 2019 the indexation will be seven percent for all pensions which is two percent higher than the expected inflation which we expect to see by the end of 2019 in the upcoming six years we will be increasing pensions for retirees who do not work by one thousand roubles annually as a result by the year 2024 will have the average level of pensions for non-working population of 20,000 rubles per month today this is fourteen thousand one hundred and forty-four roubles well later on when we pass 2020 for these changes well that was to create a basis for a stable annual growth of insurance pensions above the inflation level I'd like to turn your attention to the fact that the annual increase of pensions should be the foundation of the new retirement legislation that will be discussed and approved in the second reading of the state duma my dear friends certainly question arises at the government considered other options other reserves to ensure reliability and resilience of the pension system without any increases in the retirement age or certainly we have conceded at all but my instruction the government had been working on that most cautiously we have assessed every alternative scenario will calculate it at all but nothing critical can be achieved thanks to these alternative variants these are only some temporal changes or even changes which would be worse for the economy and for the country look this might look efficient and very wise to have a progressive income scale according to the Ministry of Finance inning such a tax addition to for instance those who achieve higher level of income would give us 75 to to 120 billion rubles per year these money will suffice for six days not more because every day and I'd like to highlight that fact every day Russia needs 20 billion rubles on pensions there was one more option to sell state property and sell all the property belonging to the pension fund well yes maybe some of their premises are too big to pumpers people do not like this I agree but the overall price for that is 120 billion rubles if we sell all of them I'll send that money to the pension fund it will suffice for the same six days this is not a good opportunity to solve this oh maybe we can put more taxes on our energy oil and gas companies well I can say for sure that this will help us to pay a pension and retirement benefits for a couple of months not more than that but this way the pension system will be very vulnerable it will be dependent on the oil prices and gas prices we can be more active using the reserve funds some say as they are being supported by the money we get from gas and oil well that can be done for some time but tomorrow when these prices drop what will happen to us and we've seen these happen many times we will have no reserves in no time to go to the bottom reserves and all these reserves they should not be dependent on any oil prices which changes on a daily basis for some say we can continue enhancing the financing of the pension fund through the budget money well yes we have resources at this point but let me show you what kind of picture we have this year we've been allocating three point three trillion roubles from the budget 1.8 trillion rubles are going directly to pay the retirement benefits if we say that we would like to have never expansion of 20,000 rubles changing nothing then the deficit of the pension fund would be increased by 1.5 times up to 5 trillion roubles for comparison this is more than any national defense and security expenditures if we do this sooner or later we will demolish our financial system we will be in debt or we'll have to issue more and more money there'll be hyperinflation a spike in the amount of the number of poor people will will not be solving the most acute problems we will not be developing our healthcare and education helping families rebuilding our infrastructure modernizing it we will be trailing behind other countries in terms of the economy the technological growth so it is not the time for any cosmetic changes it would be unreasonable for our country and for our children we need to do more I'd like to remind you again that for many years I've been very cautious and I was very cautious when assessing the retirement legislation and madness but the tendencies we see today in the field of the workforce productivity and demographic situation show that we have no time to waste our decisions should be just well balanced we should take into account the interests of people and in that context I think there is a number of measures to be taken to soften up and to water down the situation first we say that we are going to increase the retirement age for women by 8 years and 4 million by 5 years this is Ron I believe this is not fair in our country we cherish women we understand that the women not only work they all sir ok about the house about the children and grandchildren so the diamond age for women should not be rising on a number which is hive of that for man so what I suggest that we decrease that number from 8 to 5 years then we should foresee an opportunity to go on retirement for from others who have three or more children so if a mother has three children she can retire before time I live for children for years prior and if women who have five or more children they would be able to retire when they are 15 then secondly we are going to implement this gradually so that people will be able to adapt to have new plans I understand it very well that it will be most difficult for those who will face this challenge first and it will happen soon we need to understand that we do that is why those who are supposed to be leaving according to the current diamond legislation we would like to establish a special benefit for them so they would be able to retire six months prior to the news amended timeline so for instance if you were to retire in January 2020 you'll be able to do that in july 2019 six months prior as I said thirdly so what are the concerns and worries of the people who are about to retire now they are afraid that they will have no job they're afraid that they will have no pensions no salaries to support them because after return 50 they find it difficult to get a job so we need to foresee some certain guarantees that would help people of the Third Age and ensure that they have work so for a transitional period I think that we will have five years as the pre retirement age I think that the certain amendments should be done when it comes to the punishment for the companies and enterprises who do not want to hire people who are about to retire and that punishment can be not only administrative but also criminal one that would be implemented just in parallel to the retirement legislation amendments it would be wrong to be guided only by some certain administrative measures that is why I struck the government to suggest real drivers full business so that employers will be interested truly interested in maintaining the current scheme of the people who work for them people who are about to go on retirement because these people who have experience they're well disciplined they're professionals they can contribute to their companies and enterprises it is important so that they just as like The Young Ones would be able to have advanced courses acquire new skills enhance their professional skills and competence that is why I instruct the government to establish for the people who are close to the retirement age a special program on the advanced training it should be established as soon as possible it will be financed thanks to the federal budget if a person decides to retire on its own then we should help that person as much as we can and to do that we will be increasing the unemployment benefits for the people who are close to retirement age from four thousand nine hundred roubles to eleven thousand two hundred and eighty two rubles that will be done on the first of January 2019 and this kind of benefit will be paid throughout one year after leaving a company or enterprise also people close to the time attached would be able to get two days for going to hospitals and checking their house and that would be done absolutely freely we should not work on the template we should take into account the have every aspect of life of our people we will be preserving the benefits for - for those who work on chemical plans those who suffered during the Chernobyl catastrophe some other categories as well I believe that we need to ensure the preservation of the pensions for the peoples of the north of Russia we need to help the people who live in villages and rural areas for instance we discussed many times that at 25% race might be implemented for those people who work in villages and in rural areas they have experience in agriculture but they may be finding no work at the moment so this as I suggested will be done on the starting from the first of January 2019 then I believe that those who started working early should enjoy the benefit of retiring sooner taking account their work record current legislation says that people should work for 40 years and for 45 years for man only after that they can retire I say that this can be changed and for women it will be 37 years and for man it will be 42 also I think is of principal importance to preserve for the transitional period until we implement the amendments in in full every federal benefit which are in force as of December 2013 1 2008 and I mean the benefits and cuts on taxes on property and land yes these benefits have been granted only to the people who are retiring but in the situation when we expect to have the amendments implement and people are looking forward to having these benefits we need to make an exclusion and help them achieve just that they will be having these benefits not they retire but when they hit a certain age so it will be for women 55 years and for men 60 years that will be the threshold so before they retire they will be able to have their taxes cut it will be painless for their apartments and lands I know that the dinner receive United Russian many local administrations have put forward initiatives to preserve regional benefits this is very important I understand such as transportation tickets free of charge benefits on the utilities capital reconstruction benefits I do think that this is a very wise decision and every necessary decision will be made even before the amendments will be coming into force my friends as we all know many experts today think that it's high time we did something we should have implemented these things earlier they say I don't think so we were not ready but today we cannot postpone it any longer that would be irresponsible that can lead to dire consequences for the economy and for the Society of Russia that can have a very negative impact on the lives of millions of people today we understand that the state will sooner or later increase in the retirement age but we need it today because otherwise it would be even worse if we do it later on we will not be able to water down the impact will not be having any more benefits in the long term perspective if we do not act now that can put the stability of our society at risk as well as its security we need to grow to develop to overcome situation when we have poor people we have the responsibility to ensure good life for people a third age so these suggestions will be amendments to the legislation and the state humor is to consider them so my friends I have made every effort to report to you the situation we have now with all due respect and caution and I did that conscientiously explaining you what kind of situation we have in the field of the retirement and pension system these are difficult decisions but we need them please understand that we really need to do that
