1
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,470
I think I saw it first
shortly after it was put in,

2
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,190
and it took me a little
bit to connect it,

3
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,460
to think, “Well, what is that
and what holiday is this?”

4
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,650
I really had no
idea what it meant.

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,740
I didn’t feel it
was very attractive.

6
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,630
Later, I got a phone
call from someone

7
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,040
who said, “Did you notice
there’s a blue line in Warwick?

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,680
And is that a statement
about Black Lives Matter?”

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,130
So it made me wonder.

10
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,040
There were lines that were
painted in other communities.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,620
And we started getting
phone calls, of course.

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,500
The village board felt that
it was an important thing,

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,280
because our police
force does a great job.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
And it was very simple.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,980
It’s going to eventually fade.

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,390
It was just a tip of the hat.

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,630
I first saw the blue
line showing of support

18
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,010
on the internet, and I
was touched when I saw it.

19
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,540
I didn’t expect it.

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,330
That blue line has been
interpreted in different ways

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,640
by different people.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,550
There are many people,
good thinking people,

23
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,699
that were outraged.

24
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:35,490
And there are a lot of
good thinking people

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,700
who felt, well, this is a
way that we can say thanks

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,980
to our active police force.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,740
Warwick is this town that
wants to be adorable,

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,830
wants to be this beautiful place
that people want to come to.

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,710
And all of a sudden,
we’ve got this ugly line

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,250
down the middle of the road.

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,760
The reason that I say that
it’s clearly Blue Lives Matter

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,680
is because of the
political context

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,100
in this country, the fact that
the Black Lives Matter movement

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,720
has been gaining some traction.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,970
Why do we need to
suddenly stand up and say,

36
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,410
“We support our police”?

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,860
What was the intent
of the blue line?

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,830
To show appreciation for
law enforcement, local law

39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,030
enforcement, without any of the
other things being dragged in.

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,410
I don’t think they were
looking beyond Warwick

41
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,240
when they did that.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,450
And why?

43
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,725
Why did they have to?

44
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,695
[woman playing guitar]

45
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:27,588
(SINGING) Things I never
told you haunt and choke me

46
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:28,781
every day.

47
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,689
Want to give it
up and let it go.

48
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,600
Warwick is mostly white.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,580
There’s not many times when
I see any minorities really around.

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,790
I personally have had
good and bad experiences

51
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,930
with the police.

52
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,580
More so when I was
a little younger,

53
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,760
I experienced a lot more run-ins
with the police.

54
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,490
Getting taken out
of the car for no reason.

55
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,730
It only has to go badly once.

56
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,730
That’s what comes to mind when
I saw the line, is that

57
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,950
I just felt like it was dismissive.

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,480
This is a problem.

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,511
Even my friends don’t generally
talk about issues of race,

60
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:13,010
what they’ve noticed, what’s
going on in the country, what’s

61
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,270
going on around them.

62
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,060
I think people are still 
very uncomfortable

63
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,840
about addressing race.

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,730
This is only a
manifestation of something

65
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,060
deeper in our
psyche around race.

66
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,980
And it’s there whether the
blue line surfaced or not.

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,670
“There is a national discussion
currently being had about this.

68
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,503
And from where we’re
standing, the blue line

69
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:42,850
takes a side in that argument.”

70
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,040
I decided to write a petition.

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,350
Not all of them, but
there are police officers

72
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,910
doing terrible things.

73
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,140
And we can’t just stand behind
any act committed by any police

74
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,120
officer simply because
they wear the uniform.

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,420
And that’s what I was
trying to draw attention to.

76
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,400
One of the comments
on my petition

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,830
actually sprung
another petition.

78
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,010
It was racially charged.

79
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,310
That was hard to see.

80
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,370
I don’t know what
will come of that.

81
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,030
I think most police officers,
the vast majority of them,

82
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,550
are trying to do a good job.

83
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,427
And we should stand by
them and honor them.

84
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,160
No.

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,250
Who put this out?

86
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,720
It says, “Black people
are killing each other,

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,790
so the police have
to do it, too."

88
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,150
That makes no sense to me.

89
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,860
See, the thing is, I could
not support the letter that

90
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,320
is for the blue line.

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,070
There are almost 600 supporters.
That horrifies me.

92
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,519
I didn’t think there were that
number of people in Warwick

93
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,060
who would support
a letter like this.

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,460
Oh, boy.

95
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,456

Get the blue line back.

[interposing voices]

102
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,330
This afternoon, we
made a determination

103
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,820
to take away the blue
line and to repaint

104
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,190
it the colors of our nation.

105
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,460
To change it was to
be more inclusive.

106
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,020
Excuse me.

107
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,380
If you can’t hold your
mouth, you can leave.

108
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,463
Mr. Mayor, I am ashamed
of what you did today.

109
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:05,429
Yeah!

[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

111
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,625
You disrespected the Warwick

officers living here.

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,679
That wasn’t the intent.

114
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,220
That wasn’t —

115
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,210
Excuse me.

116
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,180
Don’t put words in my mouth.

117
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,444
If you don’t like it, you
can walk out those doors.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,450
It can be corrected!

119
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,060
I wrote a letter in
opposition to the blue line.

are New York City policemen.

in opposition to Black Lives Matter.

Let’s have a quick
dose of truth here.

Let’s talk truth.

137
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,160
Police are being
assassinated in this country

138
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,380
at unprecedented rates.

139
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,360
This is due to a
lie that would have

140
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,910
us think that police
are hunting down

141
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,730
young minority males for sport.

142
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,260
Black Lives Matter
is built on this lie.

143
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,930
And the radicals’
objection to the blue line

144
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,590
was because it challenges
the Black Lives Matter lie.

145
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,050
Since January 1, there
have been almost 750

146
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,540
black-on-black
assassinations in Chicago.

147
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,340
But these deceitful
radicals want

148
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,280
to focus on the less
than 1% of instances

149
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,940
where a police officer engages
and kills one such often

150
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,470
armed and dangerous thug.

151
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,940
Mike Brown in
Ferguson, Missouri,

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,790
was a vicious thug engaged
in a violent assault.

153
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,340
This shows how these radicals
sit nice and comfortably

154
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,850
in Warwick and make lazy,
ill-informed condemnations

155

of our police.

You don’t get off
scot-free here.

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,210
It’s time to confront
you and shut you down.

You said you felt that
that line was offensive

167
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,568
and that you felt
threatened by that line.

The controversy continues.

When you’re talking about an
issue like Black Lives Matter,

176
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,800
it’s unfortunate that people
can look at the name of it

177

and somehow think
that it’s offensive

178

saying that black lives … matter.

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,440
It seems like such a basic
thing that, unless you’re awful,

180
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,265
there’s no reason for you
to feel like it isn’t true.

181
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,640
People were saying
at the meeting

182
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,330
that, you know, 
“Black-on-black crime!”

183
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,670
It’s crime.

184
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,310
And when the particular
people they’re talking about

185
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,800
do kill other black
people, or whatever,

186
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,540
they go to jail for it.

187
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,030
I’m not a supporter
of Black Lives Matter.

188
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,310
I’m a supporter of
All Lives Matter.

189
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,980
My son is a New York
City police officer.

190
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,070
I never know, when he leaves, am
I ever going to see him again.

191
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,270
We were taught that if you
were told to stop by a police officer

192
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,940
you stopped.

193
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,920
In some of the instances,
where unfortunately people

194
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,460
were killed, they were
given a chance to comply.

195
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,870
They didn’t comply.

196
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,960
What did you think the
police were going to do?

197
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,980
A snippet of a cell phone
video of which you probably

198
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,370
don’t see the whole thing
from start to finish,

199
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,530
just the snippet,
should not be the end

200
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,360
of a police officer’s career.

201
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,290
You weren’t there.

202
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,930
You’ve had no training.

203
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,110
You don’t know what the police
officers are up against.

204
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,622
Don’t be an armchair cop.

205
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,080
Sometimes it just
feels like people

206
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,650
are being willfully obtuse.

207
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,540
There’s still this group
that doesn’t necessarily

208
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,720
get a fair shake,
because people were

209
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,310
willing to forego the
entire picture in order

210
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,850
to support this idea
of what the police are.

211
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,010
It’s just been a generally
pretty difficult time

212
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:48,600
for a lot of people, so I
think perceptions have changed.

213
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,650
And not just me, but
I feel like people

214
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,348
see each other differently.

215
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,550
My mom is very tied
to the police station.

216
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,052
They’ve known me since before
I could probably speak.

217
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,860
We have blue painter’s tape
across our car supporting police.

218
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,280
After leaving the
meeting and seeing —

219
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,130
just reflecting on
how the meeting went

220
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,020
and how it kept running in circles
and running in circles,

221
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,960
I was like, “That’s not … We can’t
approach it that way.”

222
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,460
The next day, that’s
when we decided

223
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,590
to go about it the
complete opposite way.

224
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,996
We wanted to present a
proper, more mature way

225
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,370
of going about
things, as opposed

226
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,461
to what some of the
other people were doing.

227
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:41,685
More civilized.
— Right.

228
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,280
The mayor, he’s
trying really hard

229
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,690
to sit down with people on
both sides of this issue

230
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,205
and figure out a way
to resolve things.

231
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:57,830
Unfortunately, there’s a
really loud and small group,

232
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,680
but very hostile.

233
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,620
There are people who support
the same things they support

234
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,630
in a very different way,
and I think that they

235
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,884
will get what they want.

236
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,270
We have been through
quite a week.

237
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,240
Definitely not the
Warwick community

238
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,520
that we’re so famous for.

239
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,680
There were a series
of meetings where

240
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,580
people disagreed, but then
also saw the common ground.

241
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,340
There was an
understanding that it’s

242
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,980
O.K. to reinstate the blue line.

243
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,460
But the question is, if there
is people in our community

244
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,364
that do have fears, that should
be part of that discussion.

245
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,350
I grew up in the
city of Newburgh,

246
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,590
which isn’t far from Warwick.

247
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,590
Growing up, seeing that
with the black community

248
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,312
treated themselves definitely
made me have a huge bias.

249
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:04,520
When all the Black Lives
Matter stuff was coming out,

250
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,394
I’m like, “Oh, wow, I
got no sympathy for you,

251
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:10,100
you guys are treating yourself
like animals. Look at you.”

252
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,240
Until this came about.

253
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,110
She was actually responsible for
really opening my eyes to it.

254
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,120
She’s like, “I have
a black family,

255
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,050
I was raised by a black family.”

256
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,380
And the Black Lives
Matter was started

257
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,460
by three people who are saying
that they weren’t being heard.

258
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,440
And they felt there
was injustices

259
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,050
in the criminal justice system.

260
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,110
Am I in the same camp
as Don and Nicole?

261
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,750
No.

262
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,300
But I don’t have
to feel as strongly

263
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,150
about the thing they’re
passionate about in order

264
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,350
to work with them on it.

265
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,770
As we move forward, we’re
going to continue to disagree.

266
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,450
But we have to realize
that we are all different,

267
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,480
and that conversation
has to continue.

268
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,889
[applause]

269
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,470
There are going to
be people who say

270
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,053
that the line is
coming back, and that

271
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,470
still sends a terrible message.

272
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,370
And I hope that they see
that the problems that they

273
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,890
have with the police
that make them

274
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,490
have a problem with the line —

275
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,740
we’re trying to address those.

276
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,870
What we get out of it is
so much more than stripping

277
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,041
paint off the road.

278
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,590
We kind of wanted to
make community outreach

279
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,796
not the people
like me and him who

280
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,420
love the police, but
the people who are

281
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,282
a little bit afraid or unsure.

282
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,240
Apprehensive.

283
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,310
This is a program
that was developed

284
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,300
to help police and residents
build relationships.

285
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,780
It’s meant to take
place in small groups

286
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,740
of 10 to 12 people.

287
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,460
We have the dialogue started.

288
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,710
We have the ear
of the people who

289
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,740
are in charge of making those
sorts of changes possible.

290
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,310
And we have the attention of
people who didn’t even really

291
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,840
believe it was necessary.

292
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,340
We didn’t have that before.

293
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,680
We just had a line.

294
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,390
As a point of information,
just to be updated,

295
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,060
so … the line will be
allowed to fade away.

296
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,800
Then we transition
to the statue?

297
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,430
It’s basically going to be
a three-tier thing, where

298
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,650
etched on one side is
going to be the oath.

299
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,480
Then in the middle
is an etching,

300
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,410
the blue line [inaudible].

301
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,800
So you’re going to bring the
blue line to the statute?

302
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,300
Yeah.

303
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,500
That’s our plan, yeah.

304
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,370
To me, the blue line is
a controversial issue,

305
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,660
and it will always remain
so, especially in Warwick.

306
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,210
The blue line literally
honors every fallen officer,

307
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,720
and it’s out of respect that
I want that blue line there.

308
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,520
If you choose not
to visit, you don’t

309
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,900
have to see the blue line.

310
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,800
Then the people who choose
to visit and actually support

311
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,410
our police —

312
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,690
Don, keep in mind that when
that whole crisis happened,

313
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,230
we could’ve dug in and said,
“No return to the blue line.”

314
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,894
We got controversy around
that from people I know.

315
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:43,560
We got some negative
stuff from that.

316
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,310
But we didn’t, and it
was an act of trust.

317
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,790
And I'm asking you
to remember that.

318
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,510
I think it’s still far
from being resolved.

319
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,290
The deeper conversations haven’t
really continued in a way

320
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,880
that they need to continue.

321
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,340
That concerns me.

322
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,920
There has to be more people
in our community a part

323
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,660
of that conversation,
because none of us

324
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,010
speak for the whole community.

325
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,030
I used to think that
Warwick as a whole

326
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,170
was generally more
forward thinking,

327
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,370
but I had my suspicions.

328
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,300
At least it feels like,
somewhat, concerns

329
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,760
are being heard.

330
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,310
I think we’re at a
crossroads right now.

331
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,830
We’re at a point where
we can accelerate

332
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,410
our forward
movement, but we also

333
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,680
could very likely slide back.

334
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,670
To be able to grow, you
have to be realistic.

335
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,000
You have to look at what’s still
lacking in the community, what

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,790
work still needs to be done.

337
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,770
I think that the line
will fade, and I don’t

338
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,552
think they’ll paint another.

339
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,390
And that’s fine.

340
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,235
But hopefully with that and
after this whole election

341
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:58,474
that’s been very divisive
to our country, hopefully

342
00:16:58,474 --> 00:16:59,390
there will be healing.

343
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,740
And then lines won’t matter.

344
00:17:03,740 --> 00:00:00,000
[music]
