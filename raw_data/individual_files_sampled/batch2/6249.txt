the Democrats are losing the Millennial vote and need to change message no kidding according to a youth political Post poll found that only a minority 33% of young Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president while the majority believe that the president is mentally unfit generally dishonest or racist so that should look good for the Democrats right but similarly a Pew Research Center a study of the generational gap in American politics they found among other things that Millennials have by far the most negative view of Trump having tumbled from 64% job approval rating for President Obama to a dismal 27 percent approval for Trump in twenties so they're saying in the first year of their administration's Barack Obama was super popular Trump super unpopular with Millennials okay it also found that Millennials self-identify much less as conservative and much more as liberal than previous generations supporting progressive stances on economic and equality global warming immigration and racial equality so it may take liberals by surprise to hear that a recent Reuters Ipsos mega poll of sixteen thousand respondents found that the Democrats are losing ground with Millennials while Millennials still prefer the Democratic Party or the Republicans that support is tanking so listen to what they're saying so this article is saying that Millennials are more liberal than conservative and it's growing that way and they just detest Donald Trump yet the Democratic Party is losing them too what does that tell you that people are looking for a party that actually represents them and there isn't one that's what this is telling me that while the Democratic Millennials are wild Millennials are hating on Trump and embracing liberal ideas and policies they're also them exiting it's time Bernie it's time in just two years support for the Democrats job dropped from 55% to 46% meanwhile their support for Republicans has remained stable so what this says effectively so what this is saying is that millennial support for Democrats is dropping off the table millennial support for Republicans steady so what's happening is that progressives Millennials all also see that the Democrats is a graveyard for progressives so while they're becoming more progressive they're not becoming more Democrats the drop in Democratic support among white Millennials is roughly the same 8% but most of the defectors in that group seem to have moved to the Republicans so if you're white millennial and you leave the Democrats you go to the Republicans but if you're a minority millennial and you leave the Democrats you just don't go anywhere today as white Millennials support the Democrats as Republicans 39 percent of Millennials support each party just two years ago the Democrats had a 14% lead over Republicans with white Millennials today this group favors Republicans over Democrats bias tagging and let staggering 11% in 2016 Democrats Len white Millennials by 12 percent that's a big switch and that's happening during Trump when Millennials see the Democrats offered noting that they are the assistants that's what's happening so this whole show is showing you that even in the era of Trump the Democrats are worthless why because they're owned by the same people that Trump is owned and serves that's what we're left with go ahead I'll throw it over to my panel any comment on that that that's an awesome stat that the the Millennials were favoring the Democrats and now they're not by 11% that's a different that's unbelievable go ahead well it's just it's just what we've seen especially in the past couple years for a long time it's been pretty obvious that we have two parties a fringe right-wing party and at best a center-right wing party I think that's being a little too generous even saying center-right and for a long time I thought well maybe if that represents the populist of the country but it doesn't and you know to his credit Bernie Sanders really shone a light on all that yes he made us see simply by jumping on a platform and then doing what nobody expected he showed all of us hey we're not alone we're actually there's more of us there's more of the media tried to tell us we were alone we're not alone we're the majority there's more of us than anyone else and that's why you know like we say you need a third party CNN refers to this show as a far left show why because we advocate for things that are popular with the majority of people mm-hmm single-payer but majority of Americans are for it free college same thing ending the wars investing that money same thing what a minimum wage same thing most people are for all these things and we about Wall Street regulation breaking up the bank most people are for these things green jobs a great green job this is considered fringe by the establishment media and the establishment politicians and this is why the Millennials are fleeing the Democratic Party meanwhile Bernie tries to prop them up because he wants to run and if Bernie loses in 2020 then he has wasted four years building absolutely nothing is our revolution they're all we're gonna push progressives all over the country the blue is the blue states ascending Dianne Feinstein Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi back to back to Washington almost worgen swear at this you know and I'm I would just like just I know Millennials you know aren't have this voice in this position and you know I feel like there's they're they don't have the access that previous generations had but we're all in it together and we all feel the pressure of what's happening and I'm looking at one article and they say that Americans in general there's like a thirty seven percent approval rate of the Democrats who approves of the Democrats right now what have they done just in our state in California I don't see progress being made I Drive down the streets in Los Angeles and I see more and more homeless I don't see that there's access to higher education said I don't see that there's jobs programs coming here so I think Democrats you've lost us are you sick and tired of corporate Democrats as much as we are and you think we can have what the rest of the world has and come watch the aggressive progresses with us on The Young Turks Network
