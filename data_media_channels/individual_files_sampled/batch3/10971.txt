Vladimir Putin is the number one threat to democracy in Europe and the US that's according to a new report published by US Senate Democrats it took more than a year for its authors to compile the 200 page documents the report collects the most frequently voiced allegations against Russia everything from political assassinations to state-sponsored doping and cyber attacks it also contains a wide range of proposals aimed at protecting American democracy from alleged Russian meddling for example it proposes the creation of an international coalition to deal with any interference from Moscow and suggests spending millions of dollars to help Europe and Eurasia protect themselves we discussed the report with political analyst Charles hotel it's really shameful it's you know a fake accounting of history it's not objective it doesn't really have the proper context and I think serious objective people when they look at this and they try to weigh up the various ways in which we could spend money this won't be one I don't think that that committee reflects you know the will of the American people or even indeed the will of Congress I think the Democrats tend to vote as a bloc and this this report which must have been in preparation for many months is yet another tool really used to continue to sell the you know the anti-russian narrative in the end to sell the Russian collusion delusion when a new Senate is seated perhaps with a stronger Republican Trump led majority you're gonna see very different reports coming out of that committee
