in the streets of Mexico tonight panic
and pandemonium the major earthquake a
seven point one shook central Mexico
shortly after 2:00 10:00 p.m. Eastern
Time
hitting in a heavily populated area just
75 miles southeast of Mexico City as
building swayed thousands of people fled
office buildings and homes only to see
glass shatter and roads split open this
scene from Mexican television shows
firefighters digging through rubble of
what appears to be a collapsed building
tonight Mexico City schools are closed
and the government is assessing damage
today's quake ironically comes on the
anniversary of a devastating 1985
earthquake that killed thousands and
destroyed much of the capital people in
the city had spent part of today holding
drills
