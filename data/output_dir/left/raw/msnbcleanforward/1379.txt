00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:29,365
ACTING AG AND SAID FLYNN HAS COMMITTED A CRIME.

162
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:30,366
COMMITTED A CRIME. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

163
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:32,001
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. DID HE PASS THAT ON TO TRUMP.

164
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,771
DID HE PASS THAT ON TO TRUMP. WE HAD MEETINGS THAT VIOLATED

165
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:37,140
WE HAD MEETINGS THAT VIOLATED THE INVESTIGATIVE PROTOCOL,

166
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,575
THE INVESTIGATIVE PROTOCOL, JARED KUSHNER WOULD SIT WITH

167
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:42,378
JARED KUSHNER WOULD SIT WITH TRUMP AND McGAHN OBJECTED TO

168
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:42,712
TRUMP AND McGAHN OBJECTED TO THAT.

169
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:46,683
THAT. HE WAS PUT IN A DIFFICULT

170
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,318
HE WAS PUT IN A DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE TRUMP, WHEN HE

171
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,588
POSITION BECAUSE TRUMP, WHEN HE WENT TO FIRE COMEY, CONSULTED

172
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:56,359
WENT TO FIRE COMEY, CONSULTED WITH McGAHN AND McGAHN WAS ASKED

173
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:57,193
WITH McGAHN AND McGAHN WAS ASKED TO FIRE MUELLER.

174
00:05:57,193 --> 00:05:59,062
TO FIRE MUELLER. I THINK THAT COULD TAKE 30

175
00:05:59,062 --> 00:05:59,362
I THINK THAT COULD TAKE 30 HOURS.

176
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:00,763
HOURS. THAT THESE GUYS CAN’T FIGURE OUT

177
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:02,899
THAT THESE GUYS CAN’T FIGURE OUT WHAT HE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

178
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,934
WHAT HE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IS BEYOND BELIEF.

179
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,269
IS BEYOND BELIEF. EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS USED TO

180
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,405
EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS USED TO SAY IF YOU’RE A LITIGATOR, YOU

181
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:10,674
SAY IF YOU’RE A LITIGATOR, YOU CAN’T BE A GOOD LITIGATOR UNLESS

182
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:13,610
CAN’T BE A GOOD LITIGATOR UNLESS YOU’VE GOT A STRONG -- IT LOOKS

183
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:14,611
YOU’VE GOT A STRONG -- IT LOOKS LIKE I DON’T KNOW IF GUILIANI

184
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,913
LIKE I DON’T KNOW IF GUILIANI HAS APHASIA OR HE JUST DOESN’T

185
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:18,715
HAS APHASIA OR HE JUST DOESN’T HAVE THE ENERGY TO WORK AND

186
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:19,482
HAVE THE ENERGY TO WORK AND STUDY THE FACTS.

187
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:20,517
STUDY THE FACTS. >> RIGHT.

188
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:23,320
>> RIGHT. >> HE’S LIKE AN ASSIST TO THE

189
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,187
>> HE’S LIKE AN ASSIST TO THE PROSECUTION AND THE WORLD

190
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:26,189
PROSECUTION AND THE WORLD UNDERSTANDING THERE’S A

191
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,123
UNDERSTANDING THERE’S A TRANSPARENCY RIGHT TO TRUMP

192
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:29,225
TRANSPARENCY RIGHT TO TRUMP TELLING US LIES ON A DAILY

193
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:29,526
TELLING US LIES ON A DAILY BASIS.

194
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,261
BASIS. IT’S NO SURPRISE HE DOESN’T KNOW

195
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,229
IT’S NO SURPRISE HE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT TRUTH IS.

196
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,830
WHAT TRUTH IS. SOMEWHERE ALONG IN HIS LIFE

197
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,165
SOMEWHERE ALONG IN HIS LIFE TRUTH WENT THIS WAY AND HE WENT

198
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,434
TRUTH WENT THIS WAY AND HE WENT THAT WAY.

199
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,702
THAT WAY. IT’S EVIDENT IN EVERY

200
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,604
IT’S EVIDENT IN EVERY PERFORMANCE HE MAKES ON BEHALF

201
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:41,104
PERFORMANCE HE MAKES ON BEHALF OF TRUMP.

202
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,940
OF TRUMP. >> HE HAS A NEW ONE, MAIA, AND

203
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,309
>> HE HAS A NEW ONE, MAIA, AND MAYBE HE WAS LISTENING TO YOU.

204
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:47,744
MAYBE HE WAS LISTENING TO YOU. DONALD TRUMP HAS JUST SPOKE

205
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,746
DONALD TRUMP HAS JUST SPOKE WITHIN REUTERS AND WAS ASKED IF

206
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,781
WITHIN REUTERS AND WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD TAKE AWAY MUELLER’S

207
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:52,549
HE WOULD TAKE AWAY MUELLER’S SECURITY CLEARANCE.

208
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:54,418
SECURITY CLEARANCE. SAID HE HASN’T GIVEN IT A LOT OF

209
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:54,851
SAID HE HASN’T GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT.

210
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:55,752
THOUGHT. THAT WASN’T A NO.

211
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:58,121
THAT WASN’T A NO. I HAVEN’T GIVEN IT A LOT OF

212
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:00,157
I HAVEN’T GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT AND REPORTED HE DECLINED

213
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,792
THOUGHT AND REPORTED HE DECLINED WHETHER HE WOULD DO AN INTERVIEW

214
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,627
WHETHER HE WOULD DO AN INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER’S TEAM.

215
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,863
WITH MUELLER’S TEAM. SPEAKING TO MUELLER’S VERSIONS

216
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,464
SPEAKING TO MUELLER’S VERSIONS IN THE RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE, AS

217
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,299
IN THE RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE, AS YOU SAID, A PERJURY TRAP.

218
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,835
YOU SAID, A PERJURY TRAP. HERE’S THE ICING ON THE CAKE,

219
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:14,271
HERE’S THE ICING ON THE CAKE, HOPE YOU’RE LISTENING TO THIS

220
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:14,538
HOPE YOU’RE LISTENING TO THIS ONE.

221
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,339
ONE. DONALD TRUMP SAID HE STAYED OUT

222
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,674
DONALD TRUMP SAID HE STAYED OUT OF THE MUELLER PROBE AND DOESN’T

223
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,343
OF THE MUELLER PROBE AND DOESN’T HAVE TO AND COULD RUN IT IF HE

224
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:20,878
HAVE TO AND COULD RUN IT IF HE WANTED TO.

225
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:23,314
WANTED TO. >> THAT IS INTERESTING.

226
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:24,782
>> THAT IS INTERESTING. >> THAT’S DEFINITELY

227
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:25,983
>> THAT’S DEFINITELY INTERESTING.

228
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,152
INTERESTING. >> THE PERSON BEING INVESTIGATED

229
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:32,389
>> THE PERSON BEING INVESTIGATED FOR WHETHER HE VIOLATED THE LAW

230
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:34,491
FOR WHETHER HE VIOLATED THE LAW IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER HE

231
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:36,493
IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER HE VIOLATED THE LAW IS A PRECEDENT.

232
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:41,031
VIOLATED THE LAW IS A PRECEDENT. >> I WANT TO BRING IN A

233
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:43,100
>> I WANT TO BRING IN A CONGRESSMAN CASTRO, ON THE HOUSE

234
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:43,801
CONGRESSMAN CASTRO, ON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

235
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,970
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. THIS IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC,

236
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,204
THIS IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC, PEOPLE WENT FROM THINKING THE

237
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,439
PEOPLE WENT FROM THINKING THE PRESIDENT’S BEHAVIOR WITH

238
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,808
PRESIDENT’S BEHAVIOR WITH RESPECT TO JOHN BRENNAN WAS

239
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:59,350
RESPECT TO JOHN BRENNAN WAS PUNITIVE, PETTY, VEN --

240
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:00,618
PUNITIVE, PETTY, VEN -- VINDICTIVE, IT’S MORE IMPORTANT

241
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:01,185
VINDICTIVE, IT’S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT.

242
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,521
THAN THAT. IF THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING

243
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,323
IF THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT KING-LIKE POWERS, HE

244
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:06,791
ABOUT KING-LIKE POWERS, HE CROSSED A LINE SAYING I COULD

245
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,192
CROSSED A LINE SAYING I COULD RUN THE INVESTIGATION INTO

246
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:09,527
RUN THE INVESTIGATION INTO MYSELF IF I WANTED TO.

247
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,095
MYSELF IF I WANTED TO. THAT SENDS A CHILL DOWN OUR

248
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:14,532
THAT SENDS A CHILL DOWN OUR REPUBLICAN SPINES.

249
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:16,133
REPUBLICAN SPINES. >> THE RHETORIC ITSELF FOR A

250
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,368
>> THE RHETORIC ITSELF FOR A DEMOCRACY IS SCARY.

251
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:20,538
DEMOCRACY IS SCARY. THOSE WORDS BETTER JUST STAY AS

252
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,739
THOSE WORDS BETTER JUST STAY AS RECORDS AND RHETORIC AND THE

253
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,574
RECORDS AND RHETORIC AND THE PRESIDENT BETTER NOT MAKE A

254
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,943
PRESIDENT BETTER NOT MAKE A SINGLE MOVE TO FIRE BOB MUELLER.

255
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:27,645
SINGLE MOVE TO FIRE BOB MUELLER. IF HE DOES THE CONGRESS SHOULD

256
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:28,813
IF HE DOES THE CONGRESS SHOULD MOVE IMMEDIATELY TO IMPREACH THE

257
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:32,416
MOVE IMMEDIATELY TO IMPREACH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

258
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,951
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> IMPEACH.

00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:35,553
>> IMPEACH. >> CONGRESSMAN, WHEN YOU’RE

260
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,822
>> CONGRESSMAN, WHEN YOU’RE HEARING THIS STUFF, FOR PEOPLE

261
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,457
HEARING THIS STUFF, FOR PEOPLE THAT DON’T FOLLOW IT THAT

262
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,325
THAT DON’T FOLLOW IT THAT CLOSELY, NOT UNDERSTANDING WHERE

263
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:42,159
CLOSELY, NOT UNDERSTANDING WHERE THIS IS GOING, THE FACT THIS IS

264
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,727
THIS IS GOING, THE FACT THIS IS GETTING MORE AND MORE SERIOUS

265
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:44,061
GETTING MORE AND MORE SERIOUS EVERYDAY.

266
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:45,330
EVERYDAY. LAST WEEK, THE PRESIDENT NEEDED

267
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:48,433
LAST WEEK, THE PRESIDENT NEEDED TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE OFF

268
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,968
TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE OFF OMAROSA, SO HE GOES WITH THE

269
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,669
OMAROSA, SO HE GOES WITH THE JOHN BRENNAN THING DATED JULY

270
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,637
JOHN BRENNAN THING DATED JULY 26th.

271
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:54,138
26th. HE WAITED THREE WEEKS TO DO

272
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:54,472
HE WAITED THREE WEEKS TO DO THAT.

273
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,041
THAT. HE HAS A BAG OF TRICKS MEANT TO

274
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,843
HE HAS A BAG OF TRICKS MEANT TO BE DISTRACTING AMERICANS.

275
00:08:58,843 --> 00:08:59,978
BE DISTRACTING AMERICANS. INCREASINGLY WE’RE TALKING ABOUT

276
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:02,314
INCREASINGLY WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS HE’S WORKING AROUND

277
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:03,381
THINGS HE’S WORKING AROUND ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES AND

278
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:04,182
ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES AND ESTABLISHED NORMS.

279
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:06,184
ESTABLISHED NORMS. AT SOME POINT, WHERE DO AMERICAN

280
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:08,019
AT SOME POINT, WHERE DO AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOK FOR RELIEF.

281
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:13,057
PEOPLE LOOK FOR RELIEF. >> I MEAN THE ULTIMATE ANSWER IS

282
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,860
>> I MEAN THE ULTIMATE ANSWER IS THE NOVEMBER 2018 ELECTION, THE

283
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:16,394
THE NOVEMBER 2018 ELECTION, THE MIDTERM ELECTION.

284
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,830
MIDTERM ELECTION. THAT IS THE ULTIMATE ANTIDOTE TO

285
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:20,798
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE ANTIDOTE TO WHAT WE’RE SEEING FROM DONALD

286
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,199
WHAT WE’RE SEEING FROM DONALD TRUMP.

287
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,368
TRUMP. YOU HAVE TO ELECT A DEMOCRATIC

288
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,803
YOU HAVE TO ELECT A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND

289
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,271
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND CONGRESS THAT CAN BE A CHECK ON

CONGRESS THAT CAN BE A CHECK ON THIS PRESIDENT.

THIS PRESIDENT. >> JOHN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE ON

00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,309
>> JOHN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE ON THESE COMMENTS THE PRESIDENT

293
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:31,676
THESE COMMENTS THE PRESIDENT JUST MADE?

294
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,812
JUST MADE? >> WHAT I MAKE OF THEM IS HE IS

295
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:35,847
>> WHAT I MAKE OF THEM IS HE IS ACTUALLY NOT LIVING UP TO HIS

296
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,582
ACTUALLY NOT LIVING UP TO HIS OATH.

297
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,119
OATH. HE SPEAKS AS IF ANY INDIVIDUAL

298
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,021
HE SPEAKS AS IF ANY INDIVIDUAL POWER HE HAS IS LIMITLESS, WHEN

299
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,124
POWER HE HAS IS LIMITLESS, WHEN IN FACT HE IS CIRCUMSCRIBED BY

300
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:46,958
IN FACT HE IS CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE LAW AND CONSTITUTION.

301
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,094
THE LAW AND CONSTITUTION. IF HE’S MAKING SELF-SERVING

302
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:50,495
IF HE’S MAKING SELF-SERVING JUDGMENTS AND FIRING PEOPLE

303
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:52,731
JUDGMENTS AND FIRING PEOPLE INVESTIGATING HIM, HE IS

304
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:53,899
INVESTIGATING HIM, HE IS VIOLATING A FUNDAMENTAL NOTION

305
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,500
VIOLATING A FUNDAMENTAL NOTION OF DUE PROCESS.

306
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,435
OF DUE PROCESS. A PERSON CAN’T BE A JUDGE IN HIS

307
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:58,937
A PERSON CAN’T BE A JUDGE IN HIS OWN MATTER AND CAN’T BE IN

308
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:02,040
OWN MATTER AND CAN’T BE IN CHARGE OF HIS OWN INVESTIGATION.

309
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,074
CHARGE OF HIS OWN INVESTIGATION. IT’S A BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT GOES

310
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:08,413
IT’S A BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT GOES BACK TO MERRY OLD ENGLAND AND

311
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:09,347
BACK TO MERRY OLD ENGLAND AND IMPEACHABLE AMONG THE OTHER

312
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,415
IMPEACHABLE AMONG THE OTHER THINGS HE’S DONE.

313
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,451
THINGS HE’S DONE. WHAT HE’S DONE IN THE JUSTICE

314
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:13,786
WHAT HE’S DONE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ALREADY TO TRY TO

315
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,020
DEPARTMENT ALREADY TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,123
UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HIS ACCUSERS OR

317
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:19,424
PEOPLE WHO ARE HIS ACCUSERS OR INVESTIGATORS JUST PUTS HIM IN

318
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:21,159
INVESTIGATORS JUST PUTS HIM IN THE JACKPOT SEAT FOR

319
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,560
THE JACKPOT SEAT FOR IMPEACHMENT.

320
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,063
IMPEACHMENT. I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD INDICT HIM

321
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:24,363
I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD INDICT HIM INSTEAD.

322
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:26,265
INSTEAD. THE OBSTRUCTION IS TRANSPARENT.

323
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,866
THE OBSTRUCTION IS TRANSPARENT. THERE MAY BE MORE THAT MUELLER

324
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:31,203
THERE MAY BE MORE THAT MUELLER HAS THAT PROVES EVEN MANY MORE

325
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:31,570
HAS THAT PROVES EVEN MANY MORE THINGS.

326
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,974
THINGS. I THINK IT’S IRONIC, UNLIKE JOHN

327
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,810
I THINK IT’S IRONIC, UNLIKE JOHN DEAN, McGAHN IS NO RAT, AN

328
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,244
DEAN, McGAHN IS NO RAT, AN HONEST MAN.

329
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,579
HONEST MAN. JOHN DEAN WOULD BE THE FIRST TO

330
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,282
JOHN DEAN WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY HE HAD IMPLICATED HIMSELF.

331
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:46,085
SAY HE HAD IMPLICATED HIMSELF. McGAHN HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE

332
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,853
McGAHN HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE COULD AND MADE HIMSELF A GOOD

333
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,455
COULD AND MADE HIMSELF A GOOD WITNESS BY NOT INVOLVING HIMSELF

334
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:52,291
WITNESS BY NOT INVOLVING HIMSELF IN THE COVER-UP OF THE CRIME, HE

335
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,492
IN THE COVER-UP OF THE CRIME, HE RESISTED IT.

336
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:57,296
RESISTED IT. >> McGAHN MADE IT CLEAR HE DOES

337
00:10:57,296 --> 00:11:00,599
>> McGAHN MADE IT CLEAR HE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE PRESIDENT.

338
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,735
NOT REPRESENT THE PRESIDENT. BUT CALLING CALLING THE MUELLER

339
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:06,505
BUT CALLING CALLING THE MUELLER TEAM THUGS, TRIED TO DISCREDIT

340
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:08,407
TEAM THUGS, TRIED TO DISCREDIT MUELLER AND KEEPS TALKING ABOUT

341
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:10,509
MUELLER AND KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THIS ANGRY GROUP OF DEMOCRATIC

342
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:10,809
THIS ANGRY GROUP OF DEMOCRATIC THUGS.

343
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,012
THUGS. AT SOME POINT, THE PRESIDENT’S

344
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,580
AT SOME POINT, THE PRESIDENT’S POLL NUMBERS AREN’T MOVING DOWN

345
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:16,415
POLL NUMBERS AREN’T MOVING DOWN DESPITE THE INCREASINGLY

346
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,083
DESPITE THE INCREASINGLY DESPERATE MOVES, THE SENSE HE’S

347
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,785
DESPERATE MOVES, THE SENSE HE’S GETTING CORNERED INTO THIS WHITE

348
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:20,085
GETTING CORNERED INTO THIS WHITE HOUSE.

349
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,621
HOUSE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

350
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,823
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? >> I MAKE A COUPLE THINGS OF IT.

351
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,525
>> I MAKE A COUPLE THINGS OF IT. ONE IS THERE ARE SOME AMERICANS

352
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:26,893
ONE IS THERE ARE SOME AMERICANS WATCHING REGULARLY AND

353
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,794
WATCHING REGULARLY AND CONSTANTLY ALL THE NEWS THAT IS

354
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,630
CONSTANTLY ALL THE NEWS THAT IS COMING FORWARD WITHOUT REGARD TO

355
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:31,931
COMING FORWARD WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT POSITION THEY HAVE AND

356
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,366
WHAT POSITION THEY HAVE AND WATCHING VERY CLOSELY EVERY STEP

357
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,334
WATCHING VERY CLOSELY EVERY STEP OF THIS PROCESS.

358
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:37,136
OF THIS PROCESS. THERE ARE MANY AMERICANS WHO ARE

359
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,971
THERE ARE MANY AMERICANS WHO ARE JUST GOING ALONG WITH THEIR

360
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,640
JUST GOING ALONG WITH THEIR LIVES, TRYING TO GET THROUGH

361
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,208
LIVES, TRYING TO GET THROUGH THEIR DAY-TO-DAY, TRYING TO SAVE

362
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:43,609
THEIR DAY-TO-DAY, TRYING TO SAVE THEIR HOUSES OR EARN ENOUGH

363
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,511
THEIR HOUSES OR EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO PUT THEIR KIDS THROUGH

364
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,346
MONEY TO PUT THEIR KIDS THROUGH SCHOOL WHO SIMPLY ARE NOT

365
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:50,116
SCHOOL WHO SIMPLY ARE NOT WATCHING ALL THE FACTS UNFOLD,

366
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,618
WATCHING ALL THE FACTS UNFOLD, ARE HEARING A LOT OF RHETORIC ON

367
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:54,153
ARE HEARING A LOT OF RHETORIC ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIDES AND ARE

368
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:56,856
A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIDES AND ARE SIMPLY SAYING, I’M OVERLOADED, I

369
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:59,525
SIMPLY SAYING, I’M OVERLOADED, I THINK THIS IS SENSATIONALISTIC,

370
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,227
THINK THIS IS SENSATIONALISTIC, I WANT TO WAIT AND SEE.

371
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:02,628
I WANT TO WAIT AND SEE. THAT DOESN’T MEAN THAT’S WHERE

372
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,464
THAT DOESN’T MEAN THAT’S WHERE THEY WILL STAY, THAT IS NOT

373
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:05,565
THEY WILL STAY, THAT IS NOT WHERE THEY WILL SAY.

374
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:06,833
WHERE THEY WILL SAY. I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

375
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,568
I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND NOT ALL OF US GET ALL THE

376
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,469
NOT ALL OF US GET ALL THE INFORMATION FROM THE SAME

377
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:12,038
INFORMATION FROM THE SAME SOURCES AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION

378
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:14,674
SOURCES AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO IT IN ALL THE SAME WAYS.

379
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,676
TO IT IN ALL THE SAME WAYS. I EXPECT THAT WILL CHANGE AS WE

380
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,378
I EXPECT THAT WILL CHANGE AS WE GET DEFINITIVE ANSWERS OUT OF

381
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:19,546
GET DEFINITIVE ANSWERS OUT OF THIS INVESTIGATION RATHER THAN

382
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:20,947
THIS INVESTIGATION RATHER THAN SITTING AND SPECULATING LIKE

383
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,949
SITTING AND SPECULATING LIKE MANY OF US MUST BECAUSE WE DON’T

384
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,150
MANY OF US MUST BECAUSE WE DON’T HAVE ALL THE FACTS ROBERT

385
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,385
HAVE ALL THE FACTS ROBERT MUELLER AND HIS TEAM HAS.

386
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:27,988
MUELLER AND HIS TEAM HAS. >> WE HAVE THE TOP OF THAT

387
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:28,355

00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:29,589
ICEBERG. >> WE HAVE THE TOP OF THAT

ICEBERG. EVERYTHING SAID ON THIS PROGRAM

THAT’S A VERY ABSTRACT CONCEPT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE TRYING TO
