having a hard time believing that I'm at
a prison I know there's a lot of
different education and vocational
programming's that are available for
inmates to prepare them for work on the
outside but I must say I've never seen
anything like this this is a living room
for the inmates sharing this room it's
population of ten inmates and down the
corridor with each cell and this is the
joint living room so this is where they
watch TV eat dinner breakfasts and they
were washing room also because they wash
their own clothes I wonder if there's an
inventory of these to account of you how
many are here
a library I assume like I can take a
book out and take it back to my cell and
read it can I take all it up yeah DVD
yes you get back to my cell and watch it
yes I'm looking for Escape from Alcatraz
