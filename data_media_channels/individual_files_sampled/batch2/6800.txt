THE FBI IS CURRENTLY LOOKING TO BUILD A NEW HEADQUARTERS AND CAMPUS IN DC. THE FBI IS GIGANTIC, IT HAS THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES, SO THIS IS A BIG DEVELOPMENT. IT'S EXPECTED THAT IT WILL BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST BUILDING RELATED GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IN U.S. HISTORY, ESTIMATED TO START OFF WITH A PRICE TAG OF $2 BILLION. WE KNOW HOW THESE THINGS WORK OUT, NOT TO MENTION OF COURSE RUNNING THE THING. AND THE CONTRACTOR WHO IS GOING TO BUILD THE NEW ONE GETS TO CONTROL THE PREVIOUS ONE, WHICH IS AN AMAZINGLY VALUABLE PIECE OF REAL ESTATE. SO WHO GETS THIS CONTRACT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT, VERY LUCRATIVE. SO LET'S CHECK IN ON WHO MIGHT GET THIS. HERE IS A SURPRISE FOR YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM IN THE NEWS RECENTLY A COUNCIL FROM WHICH WE HAVE SO MANY DETAILS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE, BUT HE MIGHT SOON BE ONE OF THE RICHEST BUILDERS IN AMERICA IF DONALD TRUMP, WHOSE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE MAKING THIS CHOICE, DECIDES TO GO WITH HIM. IS THERE ANY PRESIDENT MORE DESERVING OF OVERSEEING THE GROUNDBREAKING OF A NEW FBI HEADQUARTERS THAN DONALD TRUMP? I CAN'T THINK OF WHO THAT WOULD BE. STEVEN ROTH, ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST BUILDERS IN AMERICA. THE ETHICS WATCHDOGS HAVE SEEN THERE IS NO CHANCE THIS WOULD PASS ANY KIND OF MUSTER, HAVING ROTH WIN THIS BID. OF COURSE HE WILL WIN IT, BUT YOU'D THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT WANT TO RUN UP AGAINST CONGRESS AGAIN ON SOMETHING AS BALD-FACED AS THIS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE A RUN-UP. I DON'T KNOW THAT HE WOULD GET PUSHBACK. YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU CAN'T KNOW THAT HE WOULD GET PUSHBACK, BUT THESE THINGS HAVE A CUMULATIVE EFFECT. THEY HAD THEM ON NIXON IN A MALIGNANT WAY, AND ON CARTER IN A BENIGN WAY. IF YOU KEEP PRESENTING CONGRESS WITH THINGS THAT THEY ARE AGAINST AND YOU GET PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PARTY AGAINST THEM, YOU GET IN TROUBLE. THAT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN WITH STEVE ROTH AND VORNADO, BUT EVENTUALLY IT BECOMES LIKE A JENGA PILE. IT'S PROBLEMATIC. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T CARE, THEY ARE THERE TO GET THEIR CRONIES WEALTHY. WEALTHIER. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE $800 BILLION THAT WILL BE JUST GIVEN OUT TO THESE CONTRACTORS, THAT'S A MUCH LARGER SUM OF MONEY, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING PERSONAL ABOUT THIS. HE CAN SIMPLY SAY, MY BUDDY GETS THIS. AND I THINK FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS THAT WILL BE MORE CLEARLY CORRUPT. EVERYONE GETS WHEN YOUR FRIEND GETS $2 BILLION NOT THAT WE HAVE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, BUT WE KNOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE RUSSIA OR TURKEY OR SOME THIRD WORLD COUNTRY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE. AND I HOPE A LOT OF AMERICANS HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS. I WANT TO PLAY OFF OF WHAT YOU SAID. WHAT YOU SAID IS SO TRUE, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON. AND THAT'S WHAT IS AT THE CENTER OF THIS RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, PEOPLE THINKING, PERHAPS RIGHTFULLY WE DON'T KNOW YET, BOB MUELLER WILL HOPEFULLY FIGURE THIS OUT THAT THE REASON ALL THIS IS HAPPENING WAS TO GET HIS CRONIES RICHARD. HE WAS GOING TO LIFT THE SANCTIONS, IN EXCHANGE FOR LIFTING THE SANCTIONS WEALTHY RUSSIANS WOULD COME IN AND INVEST, RELAX THE DEBT THEY HAD, ALL THAT WOULD HAPPEN. THIS IS SIMILAR TO THAT, LET'S GET STEVE ROTH RICH DISLIKE WE WILL GET X, Y, AND THE RUSSIAN RICH. IT'S TRULY PUTIN-ESQUE, WHAT JOHN SAID. IT'S RUSSIA 2.0. JUST IN CASE YOU THINK SO THIS GUY WAS ON THE STAGE WITH HIM, HE CALLED HIM A GREAT BUILDER, OKAY, HE IS HIS FRIEND I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THE BUSINESS TIES BETWEEN THESE TWO AS WE CLOSE OUT THIS STORY IF YOU ARE A CONSPIRACY THEORIST ONLINE, THE FACT THAT IT IS 666 HAS TO MAKE YOU SO TINGLY IN NEW YORK THERE WAS A CAFâ€¦ ON TOP OF THEIR CALLED TOP OF THE SIXES, IT WAS A CHEAP WAY TO GET TO THE TOP OF A BUILDING AND HAVE A PIECE OF CAKE WITH HER GRANDMA. WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT BUILDING BEFORE, HOW JARED KUSHNER INVESTED A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THAT BUILDING IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE GREAT RECESSION, BY THE WAY, WHICH WAS A GREAT CALL BUT LOOK HOW CLEAR THE CONNECTION IS POTENTIALLY SAVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE KUSHNERS THERE. AND KUSHNER OF COURSE ONE OF THE CHIEF ADVISERS TO DONALD TRUMP, SO WHETHER IT IS TRUMP'S DECISION THAT THIS GUY GETS IT OR ITS TO PAY OFF THE HELP THEY'VE GIVEN THE KUSHNERS, THAT'S SICK IN EITHER CASE.
