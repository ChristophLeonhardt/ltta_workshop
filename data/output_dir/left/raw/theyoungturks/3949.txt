1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,220
>>RECENTLY WE GAVE YOU THE
STORY OF A NURSE WHO WOULD NOT

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,939
LET A POLICE OFFICER TAKE THE
BLOOD OF SOMEONE WHO WAS

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,780
UNCONSCIOUS AND IN HER CARE.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,910
THIS WAS A SALT LAKE CITY-BASED

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,670
NURSE, ALEX WUBBELS, AND A
POLICE OFFICER HAD COME IN AND

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,530
DEMANDED TO GET A BLOOD SAMPLE
FROM THE PERSON WHO WAS

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,530
KNOCKOUT.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,100
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME
CONTEXT THAT IS IMPORTANT --

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,430
SHE'S RIGHT BY LAW, AS WE WILL
GET INTO IN A SECOND.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,430
HE DID NOT

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,079
HAVE THE GUY'S CONSENT BECAUSE
HE'S PASSED OUT, AND HE WAS NOT

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,199
WANTED IN ANY KIND OF CRIME,
THERE WAS NO WARRANT, NO NEED

13
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:40,920
FOR A WARRANT, BECAUSE HE WAS A
VICTIM.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,989
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS

15
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:45,739
THERE WAS A HIGH-SPEED CHASE,
THE PERSON IN THE HOSPITAL WAS

16
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,780
NOT INVOLVED IN THE HIGH-SPEED
CHASE.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,899
THE GUY THE COPS WERE

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,079
CHASING CRASHED INTO THE TRUCK
DRIVER WHO IS IN THE HOSPITAL,

19
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,270
THE GUY DOING THE HIGH-SPEED
CHASE, DEAD.

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,270
IT TURNS OUT THE

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,739
COPS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
HIGH-SPEED CHASE, SO THEY MIGHT

22
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,879
HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY.

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,939
SO CONVENIENTLY, THEY SEND AN

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,450
OFFICER DOWN TO GET THE BLOOD OF
THE INNOCENT TRUCK DRIVER.

25
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,450
GOD

26
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,980
FORBID HE SMOKED MARIJUANA OR
ANYTHING ELSE 40 DAYS AGO, THAT

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,060
MIGHT SHOW UP IN HIS BLOOD, AND
THEY GO, I MEAN, ARE THE COPS

28
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,060
RESPONSIBLE?

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,930
I DON'T KNOW, LOOK
AT THE TRUCK DRIVER WHO APPEARED

30
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,770
TO BE INNOCENT, BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING IN HIS BLOOD.

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,770
HE

32
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,390
DIDN'T GIVE CONSENT TO THAT, YOU
DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ROB THE

33
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,580
GUY OF HIS BLOOD OR HIS CONSENT
OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES,

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,560
SO THE NURSE STOOD UP FOR HER
PATIENT EXACTLY LIKE SHE WAS

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,119
SUPPOSED TO, AND NOW THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY

36
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,880
APOLOGIZED AND SAID THEIR
ACTIONS WERE ABSOLUTELY

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880
UNACCOUNTABLE.

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,500
I WANT TO SHOW
YOU A SMALL SNIPPET FROM THAT

39
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,970
VIDEO BEFORE I TELL YOU
CONSERVATIVE REACTION TO THIS,

40
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,039
WHICH IS IN SOME WAYS OF COURSE
PRINTABLE, BUT GRUESOME AND

41
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,460
RIDICULOUS ANYWAY.

42
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,810
HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED AT THE
TAIL END OF THAT CONFRONTATION.

43
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,869
>>NO, WE'RE DONE.

44
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,630
WE'RE DONE,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

45
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,690
>>SOMEBODY HELP ME!

46
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,040
STOP!

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,450
>>YOU'RE ASSAULTING ME, STOP!

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:25,220
STOP, I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG!

49
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,630
I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG!

50
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,980
>>[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

51
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,820
>>THIS IS CRAZY!

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,330
>>IT IS INDEED CRAZY, WE SHOULD
HAVE DONE THIS, BUT WE DIDN'T, I

53
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,900
SHOULD KNOW BETTER, BUT A VERY
FINE POPEHAT WAS PRESCIENT

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,330
ENOUGH TO WRITE THIS TWEET AT
THE TIME --

55
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:56,890
>>MAN, HE NAILED IT. AND HERE
COMES DAILY CALLER STEPPING UP

56
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,180
TO THE PLATE, THEY HAVE A HOT
TAKE ON IT --

57
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:15,800
>>WHAT KIND OF MONSTER WATCHES
THAT VIDEO AND SAYS FINALLY, THE

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,580
NURSE GOT WHAT IS COMING TO HER.

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,580
TRYING TO STAND UP FOR HER

60
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,730
PATIENT AND PROTECT THE LAW --
BY THE WAY, THE POLICE

61
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,440
DEPARTMENT AGREED TO THE
PROVISIONS SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT

62
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,110
A YEAR AGO, THAT SAME POLICE
DEPARTMENT AGREED TO THOSE

63
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,440
TERMS.

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,120
SO NO, SOMEHOW THE COPS
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE RIGHT, NO

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,610
MATTER WHAT GOES WRONG.

66
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,160
GREGG
RE, AT THE DAILY CALLER, WHO

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
WROTE THIS PIECE, SAYS --

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,720
>>THAT ALREADY SHOWS THAT THEY
ARE DEAD WRONG.

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
THERE IS NO

70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,140
CONSERVATIVE IN AMERICA WHO IS
RIGHT WHEN IT SAYS IT'S A CLOSE

71
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
CASE.

72
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,640
IF THEY ARE ANYWHERE NEAR
RIGHT THEY SAY WE ARE TOTALLY

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
RIGHT.

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,070
THIS ONE IS CLOSE, CLOSER
THAN IT APPEARS -- COME ON.

75
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,340
LET'S GO TO THE SUBSTANCE HERE.

76
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,339
HE SAYS --

77
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,009
>>PAYNE IS THE OFFICER THERE --

78
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:38,190
>>OKAY, IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT
TO ROLL.

79
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,350
AND I'M SURE THAT THE

80
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,640
VICIOUS PEOPLE WHO READ THE
DAILY CALLER ARE LIKE, YEAH, WE

81
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,210
MADE HER HOWL.

82
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,210
GOOD JOB, COP,
WAY TO DO THAT TO THAT POOR

83
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,310
NURSE.

84
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,810
SHE HAD IT COMING.

85
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,280
I
WONDER IF IT WAS A PREREQUISITE

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,090
FOR GREGG RE WRITING THIS PIECE
TO FOAM AT THE MOUTH WHILE

87
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,560
TYPING.

88
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
HE GOES ON TO SAY --

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:18,500
>>LOOK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
THERE IS THIS EXCEPTION FOR

90
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,720
EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THEN HE
GOES ON TO PATRONIZE EVERYONE,

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,720
WRITING ABOUT HOW IF SOMEONE
RUNS INTO YOUR HOUSE WITH DRUGS,

92
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:39,760
THE COPS CAN TEST HIM.

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,510
IN THIS
CASE, WE HAVE AN INNOCENT VICTIM

94
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:54,350
WHO WAS RUN INTO AND HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE CRASH.

95
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,350
IT IS NOT

96
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,220
AN EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE, THEY
AREN'T CHASING ANYONE DOWN, SO

97
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,750
THE ANALOGY DOESN'T HOLD IT ALL.

98
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,070
LET ME GO TO MEDIAITE, WHICH

99
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,070
EXPLAINS --

100
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:41,110
>>SO ABSOLUTELY WRONG ON THE
LAW, WRONG ON THE CONSTITUTION,

101
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,990
WRONG IN EVERY WAY, BUT THAT'S
NOT WHY THEY WROTE THE PIECE.

102
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,180
THEY WROTE THE PIECE SO THEY CAN
SAY COPS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT, AND

103
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,130
IF YOU STAND IN THEIR WAY THEY
WILL CRUSH YOU.

104
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,130
YES!

105
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,130
YOU ARE AN

106
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,910
INNOCENT NURSE PROTECTING YOUR
PATIENTS?

107
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,620
YOU HAD IT COMING!

108
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,520
THEY DON'T LIKE THAT BECAUSE
THEIR AUDIENCE DOESN'T LIKE IT.

109
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,810
YOU AND I LOOK AT THAT WITH
DISGUST AND DISDAIN, MOST

110
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,480
AMERICANS DO, BUT THE DAILY
CALLER AUDIENCE THINKS YES,

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,889
FINALLY SOMEONE STOOD UP TO
THOSE NURSES AND MADE THEM PAY.

112
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,650
THIS IS THE KIND OF VICIOUS, AND
YES, DEPLORABLE, CONSERVATIVE

113
00:07:18,650 --> 00:00:00,000
BASE ONLINE THAT READS THIS
CRAP.
