The sound of the
crinkling of paper,
the movement of a
finger traveling
across smooth plastic —
“Cool.”
— like capitalist A.S.M.R.
Capitalist A.S.M.R.
“Awesome stickers.”
What is it about
unboxing videos?
“I’m here to unbox it.”
“I love unboxing this thing.”
“This is gonna be a pretty
big unboxing video.”
“Welcome to the unboxing.”
I mean, maybe we’re looking
to buy those actual things
and want to see them
almost in person first.
But there are now
74 million results
for “unboxing”
on YouTube, and I
don’t think the insane
popularity of these videos
is purely practical.
“I love these types
of duffel bags,
because what I do is I
fill them with make-up,
and then I just drop them
off at my dentist’s office.”
You know how it can be
oddly relaxing to walk
through a Target or a Costco
where all the products are
lined up and in your reach?
In meatspace, we call
that retail therapy.
On YouTube, it’s
unbox therapy.
We watch videos of
products that we will never
buy, never touch or taste —
“That looks delicious.”
— or even see in
our lifetimes.
In the same way that
videos of people consuming
mass amounts of food 
can be read as a
strange commentary
on underlying eating
issues, unboxing videos
reflect a culture that
has issues with stuff —
like America, where 
capitalism creates
desires for things we 
didn’t even know we wanted.
“I promise this is my last
fidget spinner YouTube
video.”
And the internet has
exploded that feeling.
Everything we could
ever want feels
hypothetically accessible,
almost touchable,
but just out of our grasp.
We’re hyper aware of
everything we could have
but don’t.
“I’m so mad right now.
You guys literally
have no idea.
I just got back from
Bath and Body Works.”
Now, the idea of not being
able to buy the very specific
item that we desire —
“My peach bellinis.”
— is an outrage.
“Give me my candles now.”
Conspicuous
consumption is what
happens when capitalism
produces more stuff
than people need to survive.
We start buying things that
don’t have any use other than
to project status.
The point is that
it’s unnecessary.
But there’s a different flavor
to online product fetishism.
This is a private
vicarious thrill.
The internet feeds an
impulse to consume not just
luxury goods, but
mass quantities
of all kinds of stuff
to help us somehow
visually process all
of the products that
are put in front of our faces
every second we’re online.
Binging unboxing videos
is like mainlining shopping —
virtually consuming
more things than you could
ever actually consume, 
without any of the
friction of trying
on clothes, tracking
a lost package
or actually interacting
with another human being.
And they crystallize
the product
at its most valuable stage —
right after it comes
out of the box.
That’s one reason
why unboxing videos
are so popular among kids.
“Open more Kinder Joy.”
Children are surrounded
by materialism
but lack the
agency and the cash
to actually buy
anything themselves.
And now, they’re
starting to want stuff
just because it comes
out of a package,
like these L.O.L. Surprise!
dolls, specifically inspired
by unboxing videos.
“Wow.”
But usually, when the
product is unboxed,
the spell is broken.
It looks dinky,
plastic, useless.
“Hey, she’s a crier.”
“Mine spits.”
Often, unboxers
look visibly bored.
“I'm super excited.”
“Mhm.”
Maybe these videos help us
scratch a materialist itch
without forcing us to
actually spend a ton of money
on QVC or whatever.
But they also allow
our desire for things
to digitally replicate,
basically endlessly.
It’s just that now, instead of
hoarding stuff in our living
rooms, we’re filling
our brains with it.
“Oh, my god.
No way!”
Are we eliminating a
desire or creating one?

Hm, with food.
Tell us in the comments.
We are very thirsty.
