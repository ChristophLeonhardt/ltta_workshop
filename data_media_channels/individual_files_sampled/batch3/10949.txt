ahead of his visit to Vienna President Putin spoke to an Austrian TV channel that interview so fiery could say at some points that Putin even had to switch to German to get a word in just over in the various opinion the flu 50-minute two rules nightmarish position you're fretting over Chester congratulations cuz it's the brunette a little worried but pointed extreme it's a video without prosthetics look you sleep on the road somewhere treated to think things do active a processor well despite the tonal interview Putin did manage to touch on some important topics like the North Korea crisis he also gave a detailed reply to accusations of Russian meddling in the u.s. presidential elections in 2016 to wishes Casella toaster you just said that mister Prigogine is referred to as Putin's chef indeed that is his job he is a restaurant owner in st. Petersburg but do you really think that a person who is in the restaurant business even if this person has some hacking opportunities and owns a private firm in this field could use it to sway elections in the United States or European country could it be that the media and political standards in Western countries have reached such a low level that a Russian restaurant owner can sway voters in the European country or the United States isn't that ridiculous sooner he stuck with she wouldn't there is such a person in the United States mr. Soros who interferes in affairs all over the world I often hear from my American friends that America as a state has nothing to do with his activities there are rumors circulating now that mr. Soros is planning to make the Euro highly volatile experts are already discussing this ask the State Department why he is doing this the State Department will say that it has nothing to do with these activities red it is mr. Soros private affair with us it is mr. precautions private affair this is my answer are you satisfied with it I do not even want to think about it it is a dreadful thought I think this road the road towards the denuclearization of North Korea should be a two-way road if the North Korean leader is backing up his intentions with practical actions for example giving up new tests of ballistic missiles new nuclear tests then the other side should reciprocate in a tangible manner in this connection I consider it counterproductive to continue military activities military exercises and everything that is related to this I very much hope that the situation will move forward in a positive way listen you think you silly it is not our aim to divide anything or anybody in Europe on the contrary we want to see United and prosperous European Union because the European Union is our biggest trade and economic partner the more problems there are within the European Union the greater the risks and uncertainties for us the mere fact that our trade with the European Union countries has dropped by half from over 400 billion to 250 billion speaks for itself why do we need to see a further drop why Brock the European Union in order to suffer further losses and incur costs or missed possible benefits from cooperation with the European Union on the contrary we need to increase cooperation with the European Union if we work at all or work more intensively with some than with others we proceed from purely pragmatic considerations wisheth Scalia stuff you just said that there is proof accepted by everyone that Assad used chemical weapons well not by everyone our experts think differently for example let's look at the alleged chemical attack in the city of Douma the reason given for missile strikes against Syria look the Syrian troops liberated that area we immediately suggested to our partners that the OPCW Commission go there it is a UN unit the organization for prohibition of chemical weapons but instead of waiting 1 or 2 days and allowing the Commission to work on the site a missile attack was launched on Syria tell me please is this the best way to ensure the objectivity of what happened there I do not think so I think it was an attempt to create conditions that would make it impossible to investigate thoroughly that is what it was what delicious cuz you just said that there is proof militants used chemical substances who punished them have they received any punishment did the coalition and attack them immediately I did not see anything like that
