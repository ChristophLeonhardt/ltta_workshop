Papa Hanazawa was diagnosed with breast cancer five months ago she's come to this Gaza hospital for the seventh of eight potentially life-saving chemotherapy sessions but the drugs she needs have run out and they aren't available in any other hospitals in Gaza either the treatment for this kind of disease cannot be delayed I blame anyone who is in any way responsible for this I've pain in my neck my shoulders I have trouble breathing my son's have to help me move around I need that seventh dose but the doctors say they don't know when it will come if a cancer patient wants to be treated in Israel or the occupied West Bank the process is complicated and time-consuming ultimately Israel has to agree the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says around half the applications are denied this isn't the first time there has been a delay in the supply of vital chemotherapy drugs to Gaza but it is the first time that this hospital has had to turn cancer patients away because it cannot treat them now the crisis is not only to do with Israel's blockade on Gaza it's also related to funding problems and the political crisis between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank the UN says only around 40% of the 50 million dollars needed from international donors for the Palestinian health sector in Gaza and the occupied West Bank came through for 2018 the whole situation and difficulty and the health care sector has been impacted in the last year in the last 12 years because of the siege and blockade imposed on that as a strength the lack of conciliation and political situation and in the lack of donor support derived from the donor fatigue with a Vida City were changes that this would impact seriously the life of hundreds of people who are receiving healthcare services and as the beds are empty because there's no point in cancer patients coming to this hospital for treatment a SMAW and many like her have no choice but to anxiously wait for the medication they so desperately need chance trafford al Jazeera Gaza
