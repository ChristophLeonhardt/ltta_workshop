1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,320
ON
TUESDAY NORTH KOREA CLAIMED TO

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,350
HAVE CARRIED OUT ONE OF ITS MOST
SUCCESSFUL MISSILE TESTS BACK IN

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,930
THE 1990S.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,160
IN THIS CASE IT WAS
THE FIRST TEST OF A MISSILE

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,660
CAPABLE OF STRIKING IN THEIR
WORDS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:36,340
THAT PART IS STILL UP FOR
DEBATE.WHAT THEY 

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
MEAN THERE IS

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,480
IT WAS PURPOSEFULLY FIRED AT AN
ELEVATED ALTITUDE SO THERE

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,460
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A CHANCE THAT
MANY COUNTRIES WOULD'VE THOUGHT

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,220
THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED.

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,519
BUT
THEORETICALLY IT COULD HAVE.

12
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:50,519
IF

13
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:55,160
THAT RANGE COULD BE REACHED, IT
IS AN INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,180
MISSILE.

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,760
IF IT HAD THAT RANGE IT
COULD NOT ACTUALLY HIT THE VAST

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,510
MAJORITY OF AMERICAN STATES.

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,920
THIS IDEA THAT IT COULD STRIKE

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,290
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IS
RIDICULOUS.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,290
IT COULD STRIKE A

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,100
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE
REGION, OBVIOUSLY SOUTH KOREA,

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,680
JAPAN, WHICH IT CAN ALREADY
REACH.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,190
SOME US BASES COULD BE

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,909
STRUCK BY THIS NEW TYPE OF
MISSILE.

24
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:24,909
WHAT COULD IT ACTUALLY

25
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,130
PUT ON ONE OF THESE MISSILES?

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,901
NORTH KOREA HAS CLAIMED IT CAN

27
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:34,549
PUT A HEAVY WARHEAD ON THE
MISSILE THAT COULD SURVIVE THE

28
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:42,190
EXTREME TEMPERATURE OF REENTRY
WHICH IS OVER 16,000°.

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,190
SO THEY

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,130
SAY THEY CAN, BUT IT IS BELIEVED
THAT THEY ARE LYING.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,130
IT WOULD BE

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,539
TOO HEAVY AND THEY DON'T HAVE
THE MINIATURIZATION TECHNOLOGY

33
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:55,640
CAPABLE OF PUTTING A SMALLER
NUKE ONTO THIS MISSILE.

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
MANY

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,700
ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT WITHIN
FIVE YEARS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,150
DO THAT.

37
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,869
FOR ALL OF THE
LIMITATIONS AND GRANDSTANDING,

38
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,470
THIS IS SCARY AND IS A NEW
THRESHOLD THEY HAVE NOT

39
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,680
PASSED BEFORE.

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,550
>> BEFORE WE GET ONTO TRUMP'S
REACTION – FIRST WHEN THEY SAID

41
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,740
IT COULD HIT ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,610
CHANCE NORTH KOREANS BELIEVED
THE WORLD WAS ABOUT 5000 MILES.

43
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,130
SO THAT IS WHY IT IS HARD TO
TRUST NORTH KOREANS BECAUSE THEY

44
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,130
PUT ON INSANE PROPAGANDA.

45
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,130
SO IT
IS HARD TO TAKE THEM AT FACE

46
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,130
VALUE.

47
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,130
I THINK THEY CAN PUT A
NUKE ON IT NOW.

48
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,130
BUT IT IS DEEPLY

49
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,130
CONCERNING THAT THEY ARE NOW
HAVING ICBMS.

50
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,130
>> THIS IS A SCARY TOPIC, BUT
ALSO INCREDIBLY INTERESTING.

51
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,130
ONE

52
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,870
OF MY FAVORITE STATS ABOUT ICBMS
IS THAT DURING REENTRY AS IT IS

53
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,950
THE SORT THAT THE US USES, IT
CAN BE TRAVELING UPWARDS OF MACH

54
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,540
21 WHICH IS 4 1/2 MILES A
SECOND.

55
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,540
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

56
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,610
IMAGINE IF WE WERE NOT PUTTING
ALL OF OUR BEST MINDS INTO

57
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,610
DESTROYING EACH OTHER?

58
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,610
WHAT
COULD BE ACCOMPLISH.

59
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,610
IT IS NOT

60
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,610
BELIEVE THAT NORTH KOREA HAS THE
CAPABILITY TO DO THIS SORT OF

61
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,610
MISSILE WITH SOLID FUEL.

62
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,610
IT CAN
BE A COMPONENT OF THE MISSILE,

63
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,790
JUST LEAVE IT AND THAT MEANS
THAT IF SOME SORT OF CONFLICT

64
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,590
DEVELOPS A NUCLEAR WAR ERUPTS
YOU CAN LAUNCH MISSILES.

65
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,590
WE

66
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,590
HAVE THAT CAPABILITY.

67
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,590
A LIQUID
FUEL MISSILE HAS TO BE FUELED

68
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,950
RIGHT BEFORE FIRE, WHICH MEANS
IT TAKES TIME.

69
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,200
YOU CAN'T RESPOND

70
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,170
AS QUICKLY TO MILITARY CONFLICT
THAT IT ALSO MEANS DURING THE

71
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,270
PROCESS USED TO PROTECT THE
MISSILE BY SEEING BY BEING SEEN

72
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,270
BY SATELLITES.

73
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,640
A FEW MORE
REASONS TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,880
SCARED, BUT THOSE HURDLES CAN
EVENTUALLY BE OVERCOME.

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,400
>>I'M REALLY NOT CONVINCED THEY
COULD HIT ALASKA.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
THIS GUY

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,830
FAMOUSLY SAYS HE SOMETIMES HAS
TROUBLE MAKING THE TOILETS

78
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,830
FLUSHING.

79
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,280
THE MISSILE THEY FIRED
TO BLOWUP ALASKA WILL PROBABLY

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,370
BLOWUP IN THE MIDDLE AND HIT
HELSINKI.

81
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,129
SEE MY POINT?

82
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,129
YOU CAN

83
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,129
DO UNTOLD DAMAGE.

84
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,129
LET'S
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT APPARENTLY

85
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,569
NORTH KOREANS ALSO WATCH TYT.

86
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,750
>> WE HAD SOME MISSILE TESTS
EARLIER ON THIS YEAR AND DONALD

87
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,879
TRUMP SAID THAT IF NORTH KOREA
TESTS AND ICBM, THERE WILL BE

88
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,879
HELL TO PAY.

89
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,879
SO THEY HAVE DONE
IT, OUR MILITARY ACKNOWLEDGES

90
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,879
IT.

91
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,879
HERE IS HIS RESPONSE – ON
TWITTER OF COURSE.

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,879
>>COME ON, FIRST OF ALL EVEN
THOUGH I DON'T LIKE TO GIVE

93
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,480
CREDIT BUT I DID NOTICE
YOUR RETWEET OF HIM.

94
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,530
YOU ARE ON TWITTER AND WATCH
CABLE NEWS 24 SEVEN.

95
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,530
GLASSHOUSE HERE.

96
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,549
>>DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT
AND MODERN PRESIDENTIAL IS YOU

97
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,319
APPARENTLY ACT AS THOUGH YOU ARE
A STEREOTYPICAL TV SOPHOMORE IN

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,319
HIGH SCHOOL.

99
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,159
>> I THINK IT IS A REALLY BAD
IDEA BUT IF YOU ARE A DICTATOR

100
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,580
THAT RUNS GULAGS, PROBABLY A
GREAT IDEA.

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,159
>> I JUST HAVE TO REMIND YOU,
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT THAT

102
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,649
PEOPLE SUPPORT BECAUSE HE IS
STRONG.

103
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,669
IF THEY DO MOVE ON NORTH

104
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,550
KOREA, DON'T MOVE ON HER LIKE A
BITCH.

105
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,990
THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY.

106
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,860
>>MAYBE CHINA WILL BUY NORTH
KOREA SOME FURNITURE.

107
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,190
>>YOU CAN GET A LOT DONE WITH
SOME FURNITURE.

108
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,290
>>AND THE TAPES HE SAID HE MOVED
ON HER LIKE A BITCH BY BUYING

109
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,500
HER FURNITURE – THIS WAS THE
ANCHOR.

110
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,510
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK, SHE

111
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,120
WAS MARRIED AND WASN'T
INTERESTED IN THE FURNITURE.

112
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
BUT

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,200
I DO AGREE WITH THEM THAT CHINA
IS PLAYING US.

114
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,710
I SAID THAT FROM

115
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,590
THE DAY TRUMP MET CHINA.

116
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,730
>>WHAT HE IS REFERENCING THERE
IS THAT APPARENTLY HE HAS SOME

117
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,480
SORT OF INFORMATION ABOUT TRADE
GOING UP BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND

118
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,210
CHINA AND SAYS THAT IS HIM
PLAYING US.

119
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,210
THEORETICALLY

120
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,930
DIPLOMATICALLY HAVING INCREASED
DIPLOMATIC TIES BETWEEN TWO

121
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,220
COUNTRIES CAN BE A GOOD THING
BECAUSE IT LOWERS THE CHANCE OF

122
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,220
WAR.

123
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,980
I DOUBT WE WILL BE ABLE TO
ESTABLISH THAT WITH NORTH KOREA.

124
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,080
BUT IT IS NOT A BAD THING IN
TERMS OF DIPLOMACY.

125
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,640
SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS IS THE ONLY
INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM DONALD

126
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,880
TRUMP – FROM HIS TWITTER.

127
00:05:17,880 --> 00:08:20,650
WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE 

128
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,650
POSSIBILITY OF

129
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,650
NUCLEAR WAR.

130
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,600
AT SOME POINT WE
HAVE TO USE THE INFORMATION WE

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,750
HAVE.

132
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,500
HE'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,890
RESPONDED TO THE MISSILE TEST.

134
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,470
THE GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THAT

135
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:44,130
REGION, US FORCES OF THAT
REGION, SAID THIS.

136
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,130
SAYING THAT

137
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,860
SELF-RESTRAINT IS THE ONLY THING
STOPPING US FROM ATTACKING NORTH

138
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,430
KOREA AT THIS POINT.

139
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,000
THAT IS
STRONG AND ALSO SCARY.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
IT CAME

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,120
AFTER MILITARY EXERCISE BETWEEN
THE US AND SOUTH KOREA WITHIN 10

142
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,920
MILES OF THE DMZ.

143
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,870
WHERE WE ALSO
FIRED MISSILES INTO THE OCEAN.

144
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,960
APPARENTLY IT IS A RACE TO SEE
WHO CAN FILL UP THE OCEAN WITH

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,950
MORE MISSILES.

146
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,240
THERE IS REASON
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT NORTH

147
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,940
KOREA IS DOING AND WHETHER THEY
CAN FIRE A NUKE AT US TODAY, OR

148
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,020
IN FIVE YEARS.

149
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,650
I WOULD SAY FIVE
YEARS IS STILL WITHIN A POSSIBLE

150
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,260
SECOND TERM OF DONALD TRUMP.

151
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,970
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER DURING THE
NEXT ELECTION.

152
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,970
>> IF HE IS AROUND FOR THAT.

153
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,880
I AGREE WITH HIM THAT THE
CORRECT PATH IS TO PRESSURE

154
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
CHINA.

155
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,970
I'M NOT SURE IT SHOULD BE IN THE
FORM OF TWEETS.

156
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:40,720
>>OR IN THE FORM OF DONALD
TRUMP.

157
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,430
>> I WOULD MUCH RATHER THEY DO
THAT THEN GO TO THE MILITARY

158
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,430
OPTION.

159
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,580
YES, FIND A BETTER WAY
TO PRESSURE CHINA BECAUSE

160
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,880
APPARENTLY THE FIRST TIME WHEN
YOU JUST TOOK THEIR WORD FOR IT

161
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,120
WAS NOT MUCH OF A " DEAL."

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,310
YOU ARE JUST AN IDIOT THAT
BELIEVED THE CHINESE LEADER.

163
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,670
>> HE SAID THEY WOULD GIVE US A
GOOD DEAL.

164
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,210
>> THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE
HE THOUGHT TWEETING TO CHINA WAS

165
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,210
DOING SOMETHING.

166
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,200
>>THE LAST PART THAT IS SCARY IS
THAT SELF-RESTRAINT IS THE ONLY

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,190
THING STOPPING US FROM THIS WAR.

168
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,400
THE GUY IN CHARGE OF OUR

169
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,160
COUNTRY, NOT WELL KNOWN FOR
SELF-RESTRAINT.

170
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
THAT IS WHAT

171
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,840
SCARES ME ABOUT TRUMP AND I HAVE
SET IT FROM DAY ONE.

172
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
THE ISSUE I

173
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,610
AM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT TRUMP
BEING IN CHARGE IS NORTH KOREA.

174
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,200
MIKE PENCE WOULD DO TAX CUTS FOR
THE RICH AND WOULD REPEAL OBAMA

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,690
CARE AND WHAT DO ALL THOSE
THINGS JUST AS MUCH AS TRUMP

176
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,980
WORD BUT HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T
GET US INTO AN ASININE WAR WITH

177
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,980
NORTH KOREA.

178
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,780
HE WOULD GET US
INTO A WAR WHERE HIS FRIENDS

179
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,780
WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY.

180
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,620
NOBODY IS
MAKING MONEY FROM NORTH KOREA,

181
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,860
EVERYBODY IS DYING.

182
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,320
BUT THE GUY
IN CHARGE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF

183
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
SELF-RESTRAINT AND DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT.

184
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,870
HE HAD TO HAVE THE CHINESE
LEADER EXPLAIN IT TO HIM IN

185
00:10:55,870 --> 00:00:00,000
OFFICE.
