00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,193
>> Laura: GETTING THE RUN AWAY

2
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:13,428
AT DOMINICK RUNAROUND FROM THE

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,665
FBI AND DOJ, DEVIN NUNES WENT

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,265
STRAIGHT TO THE DIRECTOR

5
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:17,732
DAN COATS TODAY.

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,601
HE GAVE THE AGENCY AT 5:00 A.M.

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,369
DEADLINE TO TURN OVER KEY

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,638
DOCUMENTS IN THE RUSSIA AND

9
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,372
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION.

10
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:25,473
>> I WOULD SAY WE CLEANED UP

11
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:27,108
MOST OF WHAT WAS ON THE TABLE

12
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,543
EXCEPT FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT

13
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:28,844
PIECE.

14
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:30,245
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT RUN

15
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:32,714
INFORMANTS INTO THE TRUMP

16
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:35,517
CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE

17
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:36,151
INVESTIGATION EVEN BEGAN.

18
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,453
VERY SIMPLE QUESTION, IT

19
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,488
DESERVES A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER.

20
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,190
>> Laura: THE FBI RESPONDED

21
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,627
LATE TONIGHT SAYING, THEY HAVE

22
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,799
CONGRESSMAN MARK MEADOWS JOINS

23
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,604
SO YOU HAVE THE DOCUMENTS YOU

24
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:56,204
ARE ENTITLED TO?

25
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:58,473
>> THE ONE GOOD THING THAT THE

26
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,408
FBI AND DOJ IS GOOD AT IS

27
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,409
CREATIVE WRITING.

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,611
ANY TIME YOU WOULD SUGGEST THAT

29
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,449
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

30
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,250
DELIVERED, AS WE SPEAK RIGHT

31
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:10,218
NOW, WE HAVE A VALID SUBPOENA

32
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:13,421
THAT HAS NOT BEEN REALLY

33
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:16,224
RESPONDED TO APPROPRIATELY, AND

34
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:17,225
IT'S 97 DAYS AND TICKING.

35
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:19,694
SO FOR THEM TO SUGGEST THAT WE

36
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:23,765
>> Laura:         >> Laura: KEVN

37
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:23,798
>> Laura:         >> Laura: KEVK

38
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:23,832
>> Laura:         >> Laura: KEVE

39
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:23,865
>> Laura:         >> Laura: KEVN

40
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:23,899
>> Laura:         >> Laura: KEVM

41
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:23,932
>> Laura:         >> Laura: KEVT

42
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:25,200
>> Laura:         >> Laura: KEV.

43
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,235
TELL US ABOUT KEVIN KLEINSMITH.

44
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:29,437
WE NEED OUR OWN DECK OF CARDS.

45
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:31,606
JUST TO IDENTIFY, NOT FOR

46
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:33,275
ANYTHING DIFFERENT, JUST TO

47
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:34,409
IDENTIFY THEM.

48
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,777
IT'S LIKE THE LOVE BOAT HERE.

49
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:38,413
>> YOU HAVE SALLY MOYER, YOU

50
00:01:38,414 --> 00:01:39,281
HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT

51
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:40,882
INDIVIDUALS.

52
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,450
THERE IS ONE COMMON THEME AND

53
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:42,951
IT'S CALLED BIAS.

54
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:48,623
BIAS AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT.

55
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,926
FBI ATTORNEY, ATTORNEY NUMBER

56
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,627
TWO IS WHAT WE BELIEVE.

57
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,429
>> Laura: IN THE IG REPORT.

58
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,965
>> AND CHUCK ROSS, AND THE IG

59
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,400
HAS NOT CONFIRMED THAT BUT

60
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,301
THAT'S WHAT WE SUSPECT.

61
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,469
CHUCK ROSS DID SOME GREAT

62
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,605
REPORTING TODAY AND SAID THAT HE

63
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:04,272
WAS THE ONE INTERVIEWING

64
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:04,839
PAPADOPOULOS.

65
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,841
SO HERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS

66
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:20,555
IT'S EXTREMELY TROUBLING.

67
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,924
>> NOW KLEINSMITH, LIKE MOYER,

68
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:25,393
AS EVIDENCING BIAS THROUGH

69
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,829
VARIOUS TEXT MESSAGES THAT WERE

70
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,597
RELEASED.

71
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:30,999
>> A LOT OF TEXT MESSAGES.

72
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:38,640
THAT PETER STRZOK WAS INVOLVED

73
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:38,940
WITH.

74
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,809
SO IT'S ALL OF THEM COMING

75
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,211
TOGETHER WITH NOT ONE, NOT TO,

76
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:48,316
BUT FIVE PEOPLE THAT WERE BIASED

77
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:50,618
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND THEY

78
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:51,386
INITIATED THE INVESTIGATION.

79
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,521
SO HERE'S THE INTERESTING THING.

80
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,624
WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO AS A

81
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,692
COUNTRY'S BECOME TRANSPARENT.

82
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,995
GIVE US THE DOCUMENT, LET US PUT

83
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:16,311
THE COVER-UP.

84
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:19,647
>> Laura: JEFF SESSIONS WAS ON

85
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:23,451
OUR SHOW LAST WEEK AND --

86
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:25,420
>> HE RECUSED HIMSELF BUT HE HAS

87
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,589
REALLY RECUSED HIMSELF OF ANY

88
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,657
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S GOING ON.

89
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:30,825
SO ROD ROSENSTEIN KNOWS BETTER.

90
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,460
HE REALLY DOES KNOW BETTER AND

91
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:33,828
THE BUCK STOPS WITH HIM.

92
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:39,634
LAURA.

93
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,703
THIS WEEK ON THE HOUSE FLOOR,

94
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,406
WHERE WE COMPEL THEM TO TURN

95
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:44,973
OVER THOSE DOCUMENTS.

96
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,208
>> Laura: JUST SO PEOPLE KNOW,

97
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:53,848
KLEINSMITH IS THE ONE WHO WROTE

98
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:03,591
"VIVA LA RESISTANCE" ."

99
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:07,162
>> IF HE IS INDEED.

100
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,431
>> THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE

101
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,131
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIVISION.

102
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:10,999
>> Laura: WHICH THEY ARE AT

103
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:21,642
UNDERCOVER OPERATION AND

104
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:22,510
CERTAINLY WASN'T HERE.

105
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,712
>> Laura: NEWS TONIGHT THAT

106
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,247
ERIC PRINCE'S COMPUTERS HAVE

107
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,450
BEEN SEIZED AND SO FORTH.

108
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,518
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT?

109
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,453
FORMER BLACKWATER CEO.

110
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,655
>> SO WHAT YOU SEE IS BOB

111
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:41,262
DOCUMENTS FROM DONALD TRUMP IN

112
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:43,431
90 DAYS AND YET THEY CAN'T TURN

113
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:44,232
OVER 50,000 DOCUMENTS TO

114
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,301
CONGRESS IN NINE MONTHS, THAT'S

115
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,736
A PROBLEM.

116
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,438
>> Laura: WHAT'S NEXT FOR

117
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,406
NUNEZ AFTER THE 5:00 P.M.

118
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:51,773
DEADLINE?

119
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:55,477
>> I THINK THE NEXT THING IS

120
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:57,445
FLOOR ACTION FOR ALL OF US.

121
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,214
>> Laura: RYAN WILL DO THAT?

122
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,850
>> WHILE HE MADE A PROMISE TO US

123
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,454
WOULD SEEP FLOOR ACTION THIS

124
00:05:11,460 --> 00:00:00,000
FEES AMOUNT OF HIS WORD, HE WILL
