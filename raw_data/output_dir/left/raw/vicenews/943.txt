1
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,940
Warner Glenn’s hunting dogs are his
eyes and ears on the Arizona borderlands.

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,520
And mules are how he gets around

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,500
when he goes off-road to track mountain lions

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,580
that feed on ranchers’ cattle.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,360
In these canyons,

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,540
Glenn is used to finding bear, puma, and deer.

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,980
But one day, while hunting for mountain lion,

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,700
he found something else.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
— So this is March 7th, 1996.

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,520
— So, Warner, this is the area where
you first spotted that jaguar, huh?

11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,000
— Jaguars once roamed all over North America.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
But after a century of shooting, poisoning, and trapping,

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,580
they were presumed extinct in this country.

14
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,320
That is, until that day in 1996

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,060
when Glenn snapped a few photos.

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,000
— You think we’re gonna see ourselves
any jaguars today?

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,440
— But there’s a new threat to the jaguar
in southern Arizona:

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,160
President Trump’s call for a border wall.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,720
And though Glenn is everything Trump
could want in a voter—

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,560
a hunter, an NRA member,
and opponent of illegal immigration—

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,000
he hates the wall.

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,860
— Right now, much of the Arizona border has
a type of wall that jaguars can get through.

23
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,420
It’s meant to stop vehicles,

24
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,240
but people and animals can all pass freely.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,920
Trump’s wall, though, wouldn’t let people through—

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,220
jaguars either.

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,740
That’s a problem, because all jaguars in the U.S.

28
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,600
get there by crossing the Arizona border.

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,680
The Jaguars are born some 200 miles south,
in the northern Mexican jungle.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,080
At 18 months, male cats start
searching for new territory.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,100
Sometimes, that takes them north.

32
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,800
— And here’s one of my murals right here.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,600
This is one of the ones I did on my own.

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,280
— The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora
is trying to protect the endangered animal

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,900
by changing attitudes toward it.

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,400
— I very purposely picked this jaguar because

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,660
he’s looking down and into the wash,

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,880
like, he’s continuing this way towards the river,

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,780
and by doing that, it really

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,760
takes away any feeling of aggression or anything,

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,500
because he’s not looking at you.

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,120
— Randy Young is a man of big gestures.

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,340
When he fell for the jaguar,

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,560
he moved down to Mexico to get closer to them.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,970
He’s painted four large murals of his obsessions.

46
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,780
Young is the Northern Jaguar Project’s
wildlife reserve manager.

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,960
— Ever since I got to town, I decided that
I’m basically an ambassador for the jaguar.

48
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,940
— The Project purchased cattle ranches
to create the reserve.

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,100
To discourage visitors, they let the grass grow long.

50
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,800
Potholes swallow the roads.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
Rockslides are constant.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
They like it that way:

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,720
As the land returns to the wild,

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,180
the Jaguars have, too.

55
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,200
— Woah, we have got some serious flow going on here.

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,720
Wow.

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,640
I never see this much water here.

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,380
But I’m gonna say we can
go ahead and push through it.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,540
— Neglect is a strategy,
and sometimes it works too well.

60
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,620
— Oh shit!

61
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,660
We died, we’re screwed.

62
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,520
— Okay, what you wanna do now?

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,900
— I’m gonna go get the tractor.

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,080
I’m gonna be a little while.

65
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,040
— The land is difficult for vehicles,

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,940
but for carnivores, cattle, and cattle ranchers,

67
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,000
it’s ideal.

68
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,060
— Part of Young’s job is to check-in
on neighboring ranchers like Marty Monje,

69
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,060
whose family has worked this area for generations.

70
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,400
Young tries to convince them that jaguars
belong on their land.

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,640
— The Project has installed wildlife
trap cameras on ranches and on the reserve

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,300
to try and capture photos of the jaguar.

73
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,700
They pay 5,000 pesos per photo.

74
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,360
Young says that’s what the cats fetch
on the thriving black market

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,100
for their teeth and their bones.

76
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,280
Young now spends his time hunting for Jaguar photos.

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,940
It’s fitting, because it was Warner Glenn’s
picture in 1996 that really led him here.

78
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,260
— What did it feel like the first time you heard
that the jaguar had been confirmed in the U.S.?

79
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,880
— Well, it was in mountain ranges that
I had just been playing in recently.

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,280
So it was very inspirational and very much raised
the level of wild of that place I had just been in,

81
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,760
in my own mind.

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,240
It changed my own landscape that I lived in.

83
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,980
— How do you feel about the jaguar as a species?

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,100
— I get emotional when I talk about the jaguar

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,860
because I’ve basically dedicated my life to this.

86
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,780
Because I do feel like we are in
that apocalyptic moment, you know?

87
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,880
We are on that cutting edge of…

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,800
we’re losing all these species right now.

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,740
And we have the ability to change that.

90
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,260
Each and every one of us.

91
00:05:18,260 --> 00:00:00,000
But if we don’t step up, it’s not going to change.
