SORT OF A STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH TO TELL THE PRESIDENT. WE WANT SOMETHING DONE. NO PROMISES, NO THINGS RULED IN OR OUT. HISTORIAN, EVAN THOMAS ON THE SIGNIFICANCE THE LETTERS, PERIOD. EVAN, WE KNOW FROM THE PAST THAT EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE, THE WRITTEN WORD AND ACKNOWLEDGING SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, PEN-TO-PAPER MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE CAN GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO J.F.K. AND HIS MEETINGS WITH KHRUSHCHEV. ENLIGHTEN ME. IT'S PERSONAL. DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, THE WORST CRISIS EVER, THE HEAD OF RUSSIAN, KHRUSHCHEV WROTE A PARTIAL LETTER TO KENNEDY SAYING, HEY, WE CANNOT HAVE WORLD WAR III HERE. THE BUREAUCRATS WROTE ANOTHER TOUGH LETTER AND KENNEDY CHOSE TO ANSWER THE FIRST LETTER, THE PERSONAL LETTER FROM KHRUSHCHEV. THAT HELPED SAVE THE WORLD. PERSONAL DIPLOMACY THROUGH A LETTER HELPED SAVE OUR LIVES. Neil: YEAH. CHOOSING THE LETTER THAT THEY DID PAVED THE WAY FOR DEESCALATION.AND I REMEMBER RONALD REAGAN AND GORBACHEV. RONALD REAGAN WAS A FAN OF WRITING A LETTER, CONVEYING HIS THOUGHTS ON PAPER. THAT APPROACH IS SOMETHING THAT HE VALUED AND IT WAS RECIPROCATED. HE WAS. REAGAN AND GORBACHEV MET IN ICELAND. GOT TO THE POINT IN THE PERSONAL CONVERSATION WHERE THEY TALKED ABOUT ELIMINATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS ALTOGETHER. DIDN'T HAPPEN. YOU CAN SHEA THEY WENT TOO FAR. THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS ENDING THE COLD WAR. PERSONAL DIPLOMACY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. IT RATTLED DIPLOMATS. IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING WILL GET OUT OF CONTROL. IT'S SCARY TO HAVE THE PRINCIPLES MEET. SCARY TO SUBORDINATES. WE KNOW IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Neil: IT'S A RITUAL WHERE ONE PRESIDENT HANDING OFF THE BATON TO THE OTHER, WRITES A LETTER AND LEAVE IT'S IT IN THE OVAL OFFICE DESK FOR HIS SUCCESSOR TO READ. IT'S VERY POWERFUL. DOESN'T GUARANTEE PEACE, HARMONY AND LOVE BETWEEN THE TWO. BUT IT IS A PROCESS THAT WE HONOR HONO HONOR. WHY IS THAT? I THINK ESPECIALLY IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET, THE PERSONAL LETTER IS MORE PERSONAL. Neil: ABSOLUTELY. THE LETTER I'M THINKING ABOUT, L.B.J. LEFT BEHIND THE BODY COUNTS IN VIETNAM. HIS PERSONAL REACTION TO THE MEN DYING. RICHARD NIXON SAW THOSE. IT HAD AN IMPACT ON NIXON. THE PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS. OTHER AUTHORS HAVE SAID THERE'S A PRESIDENT'S CLUB WHERE THEY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, BY LETTER, SOMETIMES IN PERSON AND IT'S A BOND THAT IS IMPORTANT. IT'S LONELY BEING THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD OR BEING A LEADER. YOU NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND YOU, BEEN IN YOUR SHOES, BEEN THERE BEFORE. THAT IS WHY THESE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN PRESIDENTS ARE IMPORTANT, EVEN DIFFERENT PARTIES. IT'S JUST CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE CONNECTIONS CAN BE MADE BY LETTER, FACE-TO-FACE. THEY'RE IMPORTANT. Neil: THE LETTER THING IS IMPORTANT. WE LIVE TO YOUR VERY ASTUTE OBSERVATION. RUSHED TEXTS AND TWEETS AND QUICK EXCHANGES ON THE PHONE. A LETTER IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SIT DOWN, YOU THINK ABOUT IT, TYPE IT OR WRITE IT. IN ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S DAYS, HE WROTE THEM. HE QUESTION QUITE A FEW PEOPLE. NOT ON GENERALS WITH WHOM HE WAS DISPLEASED, BUT WAR WIDOWS AND MANY, MANY MORE. AND THEY CARRIED LASTING IMPACT, DIDN'T THEY? SURE. I MEAN, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE INTERNET IS THAT WE RAP OUT THESE QUICK MESSAGES. WRITING A LETTER LONG, MAKES YOU THINK. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. THOUGHT IS TOO OFTEN MISSING IN COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ANY OF US IN THIS MODERN AGE. WE WHIP STUFF OFF. WRITING A LETTER HAS A HEALTHY DELIBERATENESS OF IT. WE HAVE TO STOP AND THINK,
