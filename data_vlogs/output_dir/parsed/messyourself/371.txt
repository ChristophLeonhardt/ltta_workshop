hello everyone how is everyone doing it
is Misha Sophia and today lazy man we
are back yet again with heavy rain and
now this could be the last episode
because ladies gentlemen what I went and
did is I went and played all of the
heavy rain endings and it literally took
me so goddamn long so please for the
love of God leave a like okay because it
literally took me so long now what I
have done is I've created this graph now
I've broken down all of the heavy rain
endings now for Ethan there is one two
three four five six seven potential
endings for Ethan for Madison there's
three for Norman there's four and for
Scott Shelby there is also three so I
had to replay the game like seven times
in order to get get all these endings
but I finally did it so I'll leave a
goddamn like now before we get into the
endings this could be the last episode
of heavy rain but ladies and gentlemen
that is some heavy rain DLC now it's not
out on the ps4 it's out on the ps3 so if
this video reaches 20,000 likes I will
do one special of episode of a head of
the heavy rain DLC now that heavy one
DLC is like this really cool mission
that you do but it's on the ps3 so I'll
leave a guys up to you so let us start
breaking down these endings now first
things first I'm not gonna be showing an
epilogue I am actually going back to the
last mission now in this scenario
Madison and Norman Jayden don't make it
to the warehouse only if Ethan makes it
to the warehouse this happens so let us
start this shit
your match you're completely fucking mad
good a gun it's different with it you
can
it doesn't matter
you've accomplished what I wanted to see
oh I think she killed him guys you
manipulated me but now it's so funny
have my son
you have no power over me anymore
maybe I should see kind of my face in
your nightmares on your own town
oh shit
maybe I should have shot him now I think
about it
I haven't shown what looks like we saw
in power okay okay so now we bring Shawn
out here now Madison's not with us this
time okay so put him down okay why are
we putting him down
Shawn you okay I got to push open the
door if we're gonna get out of here and
then we'll show you leave me alone again
dad
I promise I never will I promise
okay so yeah it's a little bit different
so now Madison's not with me and
Norman's not here Jaden's not here so
it's just me I'll shit the cookie oh
shit Madison's not here to warn the
poopoo Oh No
of ship
II thought you careful ah
shit
don't you know
put your hands up - hands off
open fire
it
wake up don't leave me alone
wake up
they shot me oh shit horrible Oh God
okay this is the first ending Ethan's
great Oh No
sure
oh shit my decision Oh No
you've got to go there
oh shit at least be safe Sean wait what
oh yeah it's you Scott if you don't
shoot Scott he appears son okay now
Ethan's next ending is a new start now
we did a new start in my playthrough now
in this a new start we find a new house
and me and Shore and live happily ever
after and we play at the end okay so
that was what we did now what we also
could have done is if we kissed Madison
in that mission which I didn't kiss
medicine in Madison will then be in that
cutscene so let us watch that now
so this is if Madison let's just say a
friend of a friend let me jump in line
if we like it it's ours
shitty
okay this is if they all live and Sean
lives listen Shawn it's one I don't pick
my buddy rule well what do you think
it's perfect Ethan oh I should have got
this ending I'm sorry we'll be able to
forget what happened will lead a normal
life and one day it'll all just seem
like a bad dream huh it's funny
we've earned the right to be happy now
Ethan oh all three of us are away for me
stupid Sean needs to relocate share
neighbors have now saved John alright so
you get that ending if all three of them
live and you kiss Madison and she lives
listen Sean why are you laughing like a
little girl grow up
okay now we're doing the innocent ending
now and the innocent ending Ethan gets
arrested by the police but Sean is saved
and they have proved that Scott was the
origami killer
so let us watch that now oh shit they
threw me in jail open up the seat you're
free to go
Oh Shawn has been waiting to see you for
weeks I thought you might like him to be
here as soon as we got out weeks he put
me in jail for weeks what
oh they're not omitting me again dad I
promise I promise I never will again
so that happens in Madison saves Shawn
or Norman safe strong but Ethan gets
arrested okay so that's that innocent
ending okay now we are moving on to the
worst endings of Ethan Mars this is
origami blues now if this happens if
Shawn dies but I evade police that means
if I let Shawn die okay so let us watch
that now
oh shit oh my goodness look all this
origami
I think Ethan goes mad
look at him he's gone mad because he
couldn't save Shaun
shit oh my God he's got a gun Ethan
don't do it don't even please don't
a third
no no no okay don't fail the origami
trolls because you will get that ending
holy shit
okay now we are doing the helpless
ending now in this ending Ethan gets
arrested and Shaun dies so the police
still think Ethan Mars is the killer
so let us watch this ending oh my God
he's in jail
oh shit he still gone mad with origami
Jesus Christ I feel so bad if I would
have got these endings I would have
thought don't do this
No
No in third holy shit okay I think that
I think that's the worst ending oh my
god what the hell is that bloody hand
himself in jail who gave my rope in jail
oh my god that's terrible thank God we
didn't get that ending okay now this is
Ethan's last ending which is called
tears in the rain now in this ending
Madison and Ethan do kiss but Sean still
dies so let us watch this ending
we'll go away from Paradis
somewhere where it never rains
start a new life
you'll get a job as an architect
rebuild
how can I forget that my two sons died
because of me
I love the market
but I couldn't protect them
I want you to give me a child a little
boy with your eyes
and watch him grow up together
this life has to go on I'll be there
happy we'll get through this nightmare
together Oh
just give me a few more minutes Madison
Oh ketchup
so it's sort of like a happy ending wait
for you in the car
it's sort of like happy ending
this shorted still dies which is kind of
sad
but you know you can start up a new life
I guess
he's gotta move on again
it's all that side oh shit
Ethan
oh my oh my gosh these and it's horrible
why oh my god these endings are
absolutely horrible holy shit oh my gosh
oh my goodness this is mad okay well
that was a horrible ending oh hi
okay so that's all of ethers endings as
you can see they get pretty bad okay I
could have messed up the game quite a
lot and get these horrible endings I
think you guys would have been
absolutely angry as hell if she recalled
these endings oh shit that's sad
Tom Madison really likes Ethan and Ethan
just committed suicide Jesus Christ
depressing as hell okay let us move on
into Madison's
endings baby oh yeah
damn son all right now Madison has three
endings now in my let's play we did
heroin now to get heroin you basically
need to not kiss Madison or ether needs
to die and she saved Sean and she writes
a book and becomes a celebrity and yeah
that's pretty much how you get that
anything we did that in our let's play
now also something that I didn't know
when I was when I was hunting down for
endings but if Ethan doesn't make to the
warehouse and so does Norman Jayden
doesn't make it to the warehouse Madison
actually has a fight scene with Scott
Shelby so I'm gonna show you what
happens if Norman Jayden doesn't make it
to the warehouse and only Madison and
Ethan make at the warehouse so let's
watch that now before we get into the
two other endings okay so at this point
Ethan just has saved Sean and now
yeah that'd be cool but remember normal
go around I know who the killer is Ethan
I can prove your innocence
shit is different congratulations Ethan
you succeeded shitty you're the father
that I have been looking
man capable of giving his own life into
sadism Duke got what you wanted

ethan save medicine
Walt
I kind of like that ending when we're
gonna like I kind of preferred that
ending to the fight scene of Norman
Jayden okay now I'm going back to the
warehouse level yet again because I show
you one more alternative ending where
Madison is the only one to make it to
the warehouse Ethan doesn't make it and
Norman Jayden doesn't make it so let us
show you that okay now you can skip i'll
leave like a time frame somewhere on the
screen where you can just skip if you
guys wanted to see the epilogue
but this is like the last level which is
sort of like the ending you know it's
cool to see the differences you know
we've seen if norman makes it I mean if
Jaden makes it yeah Norman JT we've seen
a P that makes it and now we're seeing
if Madison makes it he's right there
Sean hang on you're supposed to be dead
I don't know reason can't let the kik
die Scott he's not responsible for what
happened to you
only this product for years I hope to
father would sacrifice himself to save
his son every time they failed was if my
brother dies again oh my god
understanding maybe I don't know call a
shit over I know what you went through
Scott lost your twin brother he's the
only one who understood you the only one
you could talk to
John and I were like one person when he
died
it was like a part of me
yeah
calm you've killed all these people
Scott and for what nothing
just to ease your pain
it has to stop now it won't make your
pain go away don't understand out there
oh there is a father who loves his son
and the holy sacrifices I'll find it rub
it
whatever rub it saves you have a chip

Ethan's not gonna be here to shoot a
Shelby now so yeah okay pick up this
thing next at this time okay let's pick
it up this weapons do I kill him here

shit Thanks
I'm gonna piss his body like that
what sort of shit okay well that was
that okay so Madison killed him with a
bloody pipe well bloody ell alright
let's go over the epilogue now the first
upload we're gonna go over is the dead
heroine and this is what happens if
Madison dies journalist Madison page was
laid to rest in charity cross cemeteries
her heroic death while investigating the
disappearance of Shawn Mars has made a
lasting impression
colleagues with oppressed are united in
paying tribute to this courageous
journalists who sacrificed her life in
the search for truth
I see it I see it okay Brittany it's a
wrap maybe hungry
you disrespectful oh shit that's sad
okay now the second ending which we
haven't seen is square one now in this
ending either Ethan gets arrested or
doesn't kiss Madison and Sean dies okay
so let us watch that
this is a sad ending I think
shit oh my god what
up
mad
yeah
I'm worried about you girl you haven't
mastered your phone in days that's nuts
I can't pretend to know what you've been
through but I'm here for you if you want
to talk to someone about it you know I'm
here right I'll try again later on oh my
god
shit
it's her insomnia oh my god shit she
sort of needs Ethan oh my god has
insomnia comes back and even worse holy
shit on my face all right now let's move
on to Norman Jaden's endings now in my
let's play we did the case closed ending
now in the case closed ending Norman
safe Shawn and he becomes a celebrity
goes in a talk show and yeah he becomes
back to the FBI but he has some like
hallucinations because of the drugs
he no longer takes the drugs but he
still has hallucinations from the re
okay so I that was a pretty weird ending
so no that's so nuts so now let's move
on to the other three endings so first
let's do upload it now uploaded is when
Norman Jayden dies okay so let us show
us that ending
he's being buried in two days in some
godforsaken hole in the back end of
Beyond near Washington I have to attend
as a matter of protocol I'll pass Jane
and I didn't see eye to eye out much you
piece of shit problem I understand it's
a new bloody guy hey sir
I still have his glasses what should I
do with well you won't be needing them
again do whatever you want with them oh
my god don't those classes are bloody
evil oh shit
Dawood oh my god he's gonna go mad if he
tries my glasses go try my glasses my
glasses don't do it don't do I do it do
I put it on no do i shit good idea put
it on the table okay don't don't push it
off
Bakugan okay I guess she doesn't put it
on you gonna burn off
it's tempting him it's like an oculus
rift
oh I Drive it on oh shit there's no
trial oh oh here we go
Mountain shit
whoa
it's literally like an oculus rift like
this is actually reality now you can
actually do this with technology is
literally an oculus rift damn son
look at them you're so happy
hello oh my goodness
what Norman Jaden's in the bloody re
okay the next thing we're gonna show is
resignation now for this ending Norman
Jayden doesn't solve the case of the
origami killer and doesn't make it to
the warehouse and yes Shawn I think does
still live but it still doesn't solve
the case so that they'd let us show this
ending are you sure you've thought this
through Norman you've got a promising
career ahead of you it's a pity that
with all due respect sir I'm done
thinking oh I need to lead something
like a normal life something like an O
blood I've just got a bit too close to
everything recently oh I need to step
back
will you be coming back to the FBI I
don't know and making no promises
Oh
oh shit he's gone he's turning his gun
and badge and his Gauss's you can keep
your re if you like but also it's going
offline
don't don't do it I'll do it
it's just a little too well I won't help
me around on
the real world shit whatever you want I
hope you find what you're looking for
and Norman I think this is the best I
hope so too
I think this that's the best ending
because let's be honest Norman Jayden
okay he had a drug problem because of
the area okay the Harry made him
hallucinate and take drugs okay so I
think it's right for him to just resign
because he wasn't perfect he wasn't a
perfect character okay so I think that
was the perfect ending for him in my
opinion okay now let's move on to normal
Jaden's last ending which is arguably
the worst ending for Norman now in this
ending
he doesn't solve the case and Shawn dies
okay
so let us watch this what are you gonna
do
design
try to forget I don't know
is trip to a part of your plant okay oh
shit don't take drugs most effective way
I found except it's now a solution
for the moment and I'm looking for
solutions oh I just want to forget I'm
afraid things may have affected you more
than you think is he talking to himself
say that I'm okay
I'm getting through this
let's just take it easy
see what happens it's all over
it's him
who's the real Golemon you may never be
on what oh my godness it's me what what
is that ending what the hell oh my god
oh shit is the drugs mister drugs
he dieded it it
shit
overdosed because he couldn't handle the
guilt for not solving the case I guess
man some of these earnings are bloody
bloody harsh Matt all right now lastly
let's show off Scott Shelby for other
endings now one of the endings which we
did in my let's play which is the
origamis grave ending which it just
shows Lauren spitting on Scott's grave
when because he died because he's
origami killer
and if Lauren dies because actually if
you guys didn't know Lauren can die in
that underwater car mission
yeah if Lauren dies then it just shows
Scott Shelby's grave okay and that's
pretty much it now let's move on to the
other three endings did I say there was
four endings no there's there's actually
three okay let's show the other two
endings okay let's do the first ending
which is unpunished now and four
unpunished Scott Shelby gets away with
it he doesn't die at the warehouse but
Lauren dies okay so let us show this
unpunished ending
damn
I guess he gets away with it
shit pretty anticlimactic if you ask me
okay and that was that ending okay now
let's move on to the very last ending
which is called a mother's revenge now
for this ending scotch they'll be does
get away okay it doesn't die but Lauren
lives okay so they're gonna confront
each other now let us see what happens
oh my god
none of the families of the victims ever
hired you did they Scott I called every
last one of them
all you did was collect the evidence
you've left behind
wipe out your past and community of the
parents whose children Egypt
I swore on a son's grave that I would
kill the man who murdered him Oliver I'm
going to keep my word
Oh oh my god he bloody maja whoa she
bloody shot him in the face
damn sundown Lauren diam okay lace him
and now those are all the heavy right
endings I thought there was loads but
there's actually 17 okay so seven is
quite a lot I had to play through the
game seven times so leave I got them
like because I did spend a lot of time
with and I didn't really need to because
you could have just googled all the
endings but I kind of wanted to show off
because there's no like ps4 footage of
the ending so I thought I would show it
so yeah leave a goddamn like now
remember if we reach 20,000 likes I'm
gonna do one last bonus episode of heavy
rain where we do the DLC that happened
on the ps3 but it's not releasing the
ps4 so we're gonna be going back to the
ps3 so yeah if we reach 20,000 likes I
will do in the last episode of that and
then we are done with heavy rain and we
might move on to the next let's play
anyway guys I want that guy starts
watching and I will see you in the
goddamn next video man silletti guys I
love you with all my heart good
