all right joining us now from Washington DC with a look at axises am the co-founder of access Mike Allen Mike good to have you with us this morning so what's the one big thing heading into this morning well good morning and on the first day of spring one big thing why the president is shaking up his legal team the the probe by the special counsel is turning out to be Messier and longer than the White House thought so the president is adding Joe to Geneva a former US attorney who's been prominent in DC for decades going back to when he was an independent counsel in 1992 going back to the Bush Clinton era he's putting him around the table and what is this show this shows that the president is continuing to respond to cues from TV Joe David Geneva is best known from cable TV and has been out arguing for the president very aggressively and so the result of this is another pugilistic another tough guy around the table that makes you think that some of that rattling of the special counsel that we saw over the weekend some of the shots from the White House to the special counsel won't be the end and we've heard a little bit earlier about the president possibly losing confidence in his legal team what are we hearing about a possible shake-up on that front yeah so this is a big addition this shows that the White House knows that this is going to go for a while that they're talking point about how there's nothing here this will be done quickly nothing to see here that that won't last and we're hearing that the president is less confident as he talks to people inside he's talking to people who tell him that some of his team may not be at the top of their game and the important thing to know here is that the president who's been in litigation most of his adult life is very acutely sensitive to his legal team just like he obsesses about its press coverage so this is a client who is not going to give the reins to his team and we have the Washington Post reporting this morning that the president is making decisions about what he's going to say the pendant of his team certainly a lawyer's nightmare let's pivot a little bit and talk about Facebook and this whole Cambridge analytic a scandal why is that turning out to be one of the most damaging scandals in Facebook's history it's lost almost 40 billion dollars in a single day yeah ever since the election Facebook has been in the spin cycle getting hit left and right but Axios is reporting this morning that this is the most damaging episode for them and it's not just because it's the first time that it's really hit their share prices and there's not even a new shocking revelation about Facebook here we knew that Facebook was vulnerable and we knew that Facebook data could be used from outsiders but this is really called into a question about trust in Facebook Facebook needs us to spend time there and if we're not trusting it if we're not willing to give it as much data Facebook suddenly becomes less valuable and that's what you're seeing the market saying so the problem with the Russia investigation is that it's just too opened a Pandora's box of questions about Facebook how it works how it operated so given all of those concerns has been has Facebook's response been somewhat appropriate are you getting a sense from Washington DC that legislators want to try to do something about this issue given Facebook's you know involvement in Cambridge analytic enough yeah as your viewers know there already was appetite left and right to do to regulate the big tech companies or rein in the big tech companies that really has added to this and both in London and in Washington we're hearing legislators saying that they don't want just spokespeople just lawyers for these platforms they specifically want the Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg both in London and here we're having calls for him personally to appear Facebook hasn't wanted that image of the top executive is raising their right hand as if they were to my company executives or oil company executives but it looks like to satisfy legislators there gonna have to be a top face out there and up here Mike let me before I let you go get your take on one big question Robert Muller there's been some questions that the president may put pressure on rod Rosen Stein to have him fired Republicans have been saying there's no need to protect the special counsel how do you what do you make of the Republican reaction so far to that to that charge that the president may be trying to put pressure on Rudd Rosen Stein to have Muller fired well that clip that you played earlier here on first look of orrin hatch saying that can be it would be the stupidest thing the president could do that's a widely held view I can tell you both inside and outside the White House if firing the FBI director James Comey which led to the appointment of the special counsel if that was as deep Bannon has said one of the dumbest mistakes in political history the president doesn't want to top it all right Mike Allen live for us in Washington DC thank you very much we're gonna be reading access am in just a little bit
