when Bernie Sanders was running he had a much more aggressive tax plan that Hillary Clinton did and when you add together the income and payroll taxes he was proposing and state and local taxes he would have gotten up to a combined tax rate on unregular and come around seventy-three percent which happens to be just about where Thomas bacchetti and Emmanuel Saez was said was the revenue maximizing tax rate do we want to be at the revenue maximizing tax rate remember this is only for the very wealthiest individuals and the logic of that says look these people already have so much money that an extra dollar doesn't really contribute much to health human welfare so you really want to get as much as you can without too much impact on incentives and that's where the revenue maximization comes in so the logic and this not just picketing in size it's Peter diamond lots of people says that that's where you want to set that that top tax rate I mean I would say yes it's what you want to do in theory it's unlikely we'll do it but it's a what what the heck it's it's worth doing go back to Teddy Roosevelt and an taxation of giant fortunes he viewed as a positive good to reduce those dark this used to be a standard piece of American political rhetoric because to preserve a Democratic Society we have to ensure that great fortunes don't dominate the economy so it's an interesting question why that is considered a radical unacceptable view now used to be standard political so it's so you would say it's a good thing when very wealthy people earn less money even aside from you know being able to redistribute it spend a ton useful fan I'm I don't actually think it's a central concern but it's certainly something that doesn't bother me and I think we do let's put this where I would like to see it I'd like to see a political discourse in which that kind of argument was once again legitimate as it used to be in this country
