on Monday two very different videos went viral the first featured in eleven-year-old boy Tyler from Conyers Georgia Tyler is Allah 18 months old when his stepfather Don Gauss entered his life the video shows Tyler approaching his stepfather reading a letter when I was 1 and a half years old something happened to me God sent me a real dad dad I've been your childhood love since I can remember but I want to be your son legally will you please adopt me Don says yes at which point he embraces the crying boy in a bear hug it's nearly impossible not to have the odd speck of dust in your eye while you watch it meanwhile another heart-rending video made the rounds this was video of Chris Gard and Connie Yates parents Vincent Charlie guard announcement would no longer attempt to remove Charlie from the UK for treatment Charlie suffers from a rare degenerative disease that ends in death the Great Ormond Street Hospital refused to release him to his parents so they could fly him to the United States on his own dime to seek experimental treatment instead deciding the little Charlie should die with dignity Chris stated we knew our son which is why we continued fighting Charlie has been left with his illness to deteriorate devastatingly to the point of no return juxtaposing these two videos is very awkward for the political left it's awkward because while what likes to claim that it stands with parents it actually promulgates policies antithetical to parental control of their children the less will pay lip service to motherhood and apple pie but the mother gives her child too much apple pie it'll call the state to do something about it that's what happened with Charlie guard the question is not whether you agree with guards parents are not perhaps the doctors were right and as parents for grasping at straws in a desperate attempt to ignore the agonizing reality of the situation the question is whether parents have the right to make such decisions to begin with we're not talking about abusive parents who physically harm their kids we're not talking about a child endangerment scenario we're talking about parents choosing a culture of life with which the prevailing leftist sentiment disagrees there is no objective standard suggesting that so-called Death with Dignity should overcome the value of preservation of life that is a subjective decision at best yet the hospital the UK government and the EU decided they knew better than Charlie guy's parents they don't the judges who decided to charlie dark state have never met Charlie guard they never spent hours crying by his bedside or rubbing the fuzz on his head had Charlie been healthy they wouldn't have been aware of him at all if they know better they'd know better than Charlie's parents what ought to happen the devaluation of parenting on the Left isn't restricted to life and death decisions it reaches down to the basics of parenting what value system should be taught to kids last month the British threaten to shut down an Orthodox Jewish girls school for the crime of not teaching children the prevailing LGBT agenda inspectors said it's a fit the failures teach children about leftist views of sexual orientation quote restricts pupils spiritual moral social and cultural development and does not promote equality of opportunity in ways to take account to different lifestyles unquote this despite the fact that the inspectors openly acknowledged that the school's culture is clearly focused on teaching pupils to respect everybody regardless of beliefs and lifestyle in Ontario Canada legislators recently passed a regulation that would allow the government to remove children from the home if parents refuse to accept the child self-perception as transgender their excuse failure to do so might result in damage to the child instead the government could take hold of the child placing them in the system and then promote text transition once again this has nothing to do with science and everything to do with politics the roots of this sustain for parenting Lyon Rousseau in the romantics who sought parents is a burden on childhood childhood freedom and exploration but the truth is far less stunning for kids who lack parental guidance they have higher rates of depression and suicide higher rates of drug use higher rates of promiscuity higher rates of involvement in crime we need more Criss guards and more Don Gauss's not more bureaucrats certain that they know what's best for a child they'd never met and don't care about the left however seems determined to write parents out of the story of their own children's upbringing the state knows best how to care for your child on everything from nutrition to sex ed to life itself if that means death for a baby so be it at least the state's view of the value of life has been promulgated I'm Ben Shapiro this is a venture Pierrot show okay a lot to get see today I did testify on the hill which means that we have a slightly abbreviated show today because I have to run for a plane pretty soon but before we get to everything that happened on the hill which is really fascinating action thoughts on it and everything that is happening over at the White House which is also fascinating and I have some thoughts and before I even get to the scandal that nobody is talking about inside the Democratic Party first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at links so we are thrilled to partner with link they are the world's first and only personalized wine club the way that this works

you the best wine then they will give you the best wine okay so there's a lot of stuff happening right now all of it bizarro world over on the Democratic side of the aisle everybody's covering what's happening the White House so before I even get to what is happening in the White House I first want to discuss what is happening with the Democrats because as I reported yesterday in Ron Owen was a democratic IT consultant and he was apparently stealing laptops from Democratic members of Congress and then he was selling them and they found a bunch of smashed equipment in his house he had access to some of their passwords he had debbie Wasserman Schultz's computer and her password that gave him access to a lot of DNC material and he was caught trying to flee the country in wire $300,000 for himself in Pakistan w Wasserman Schultz only fired him on the day that he was captured by the police he was paid he alone his family members feel like 4 million of the last several years to do IT for the Democrats and what's weird the Debbie wasserman-schultz has been trying to pressure the police to hand over her laptop and that's evidence in an ongoing local case right I mean this is this is a this is an actual crime and debbie Wasserman Schultz apparently called up the Chief of Police in DC and yelled at him that you wanted her laptop back and threatened him that she want her laptop back so Rhonda McDaniel who is the chair of the RNC she says that it's pretty clear that debbie Wasserman Schultz has something to hide here else I see worker facing charges for bank fraud this morning accused of double billing the government for computer equipment but they caught him as he was trying to flee the country at Dulles Airport the authorities arrested in Ron Alana Dulles where he had a flight booked to Pakistan through Qatar several relatives of the 37 year old were fired months ago as well and Iran was kept on staff by Wasserman Schultz for reasons we are just we have no idea why she waited so long to fire him but Ron I'm wondering if there's a lot more to this I know that he's facing charges of bank fraud but does he have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is this more about terrorism than just bank fraud we have to get to the bottom of this and debbie Wasserman Schultz has obstructed at every level on something that affects potentially our national security so to have this gentleman try and leave the country yesterday and now we know there's bank fraud and we know he destroyed these hard drives and when you talk when you read the story about the marine that found them and the apartment he was trying to run I mean it is it's a long story but it's something we have to get to the bottom of we're not hearing the Democrats talk about it at all right well we can talk back there she's totally right they're not they're not talking about imagine if Speaker of the House Paul Ryan somebody had tried to flee the country after having stolen Ryan's hard drive and smashed a bunch of hard drives of other members of Congress apparently and Paul Ryan had hired him up til identity flood minutes immediately fired him and also he wouldn't let the police do their full investigation imagine if that's what had happened it'd be insane right I mean the left would never like oh it would be the end of the world it'd be the end of the world but the left is ignoring this as far as they can't and the question is why the question is why all of this was happening you know and and the only rational answer I can come with obviously is that not only just wasserman-schultz have something to hide but it has something to do with the information on her laptop now does that tie to another story that the left is largely ignoring so the seven Democrats yesterday attempted to prevent a witness from fusion GPS from testifying fusion GPS you'll recall with the research firm that was commissioned by interests aligned with Democratic Party to produce the dossier of Trump intelligence including all the crap about the P tape so that was fusion GPS well the Senate is currently investigating this Gordon weekly standard the Senate is investigating allegations that elements of the Trump campaign may have been colluding with Russia but now an interesting angle has emerged fusion GPS is now accused of simultaneously being hired to work for putin's moneyed interests in the west using gps is apparently representing the same Putin connected interests when they were involved in arranging the controversial meeting Donald's from jr. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort had with Rinat Akhmetov a former Russian intelligence offer an officer and Russian lawyer Natalia best elements kya our vessel nigga I think to pronounce furthermore the firm also being accused of engaging in unethical and illegal behavior while representing Russian connected interest so what it looks like is that the Russians were not intent on having Trump elected or just attacking Hillary Clinton the Russians were also attempting to go after president Trump then candidate Trump by essentially working with and hiring fusion GPS to build this Oppo file on Trump according to the Weekly Standard Bill Browder's of Finance here with an extensive history of dealings in Russia his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday is worth reading in full because the machination czar complicated but briefly the story is this after Browder exposed the corrupt financial practices of putin's cronies Putin came after Browder personally deport him in 2005 and 18 months later seizing all the documents related to his investment in the country Browder with the help of a guy named Sergei Magnitsky who is a who is a Russian dissident filed criminal complaints about Russian officials stealing from the country's tax coppers rather than came to Washington DC and effusion GPS eventually ended up arranging a meeting between Don Trump jr. and aqua aqua chin and vessel mitts kaya se says fusion GPS according the Browder was behind that meeting which means that the Russians were hiring a Democrat connected firm to set up the meeting with Donald Trump jr. that's basically the allegation so it's getting a little complicated here but what it looks like is that it could be a setup right it looks like not that down Trump pewter sure to take the meaning that doesn't let him off dog but like the Democratic operatives we're working with the Russians in order to try and trap Donald from jr. I mean that seems to be the the explanation that is being given by this guy Bill Browder who knows a lot of the players and this is getting into deep stuff according to Thor Halvorssen president CEO of the human rights foundation he has alleged effusion GPS is operating in violation of the foreign agent Registration Act a fusion GPS has previously been in the news for the harassment of Republican campaign donors in the 2012 presidential election as of yesterday investigative reporter former investigative reporter Glenn Simpson who is the founder of fusion GPS he refused to testify before the Senate and said that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right so again this is a story that is being under covered when it's being dramatically under covered because of course it has to do it's wrong and it has to do with the Russians involvement with a democratic oriented firm that was attempting to gather information on Donald Trump and it's undercuts the entire narrative Democrats of course the media are ignoring this as far as they possibly can it ought not be ignored this is important stuff if you are going to say that all of the if you're going to make the case that everything ought to be investigated and that Trump oughtta be investigated for his Russian connections you have to make the same case about using GPS you have to make the same case about Ukrainian interference with Hillary Clinton all of these things are a must so this is it's not quite as Queen kind of cases the left wants to make it the Trump colluded with Russia so when when the election it looks like Russia was doing what the intelligence he said it was doing remember there's a disagreement among the intelligence he she felt that Russia was involved in the election cycle even among the intelligence he's there was a basic disagreement on one question and the question was did Russia want Trump to win and most the intelligence agencies were saying no it wasn't about Russia wanting Trump to win it was just about them screwing with the election which means they were screwing with the election from both sides then we're going fusion GPS allegedly on the left and then they were working with Donald Trump jr. on the right they were just trying to get their hands muddy and banking on everybody being dishonest in order to do that turns out that may have been a very good bet well before we get to before we get to the latest with Anthony Skinner Moochie and the end battle that's now going on Queen Anthony scare emoji and Reince Priebus I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at frame

they are great sponsors and let them know that we sent you as well okay so the latest on scare emoji is that there's there's a lot of how about breaking out inside the Trump White House now it seems like half because a man at the top doesn't seem like he is laying down the law for all the talk about trumping great CEO the truth is for a very long time Trump has functioned in a world where he sort of acts like the Joker in that scene with the two leftover thugs from the other guys gang ready sort of breaks a pool cue throws it down and says oh he wouldn't use any did you hopper it this is Trump's routine right now the two people who stopped a piece of Paquito are Reince Priebus and Anthony Skinner movie now he obviously loves skin emoji because scaramouche went on TV and was highly complementary to him for several months and ripped down CNN and got contender attractive story which is like the Holy Grail in Trump world so he loved Anthony Skinner Meucci he is less enamored of Reince Priebus he has been I mean has been every two weeks talk about Reince Priebus being fired and that is alive once again people are talking about that again and scaramouche E this time it actually looks like to make that happen so scary Moochie yesterday tweeted out that he thought basically the Reince Priebus was the leaker and so essentially he tweeted out yesterday that that there was a felony that had taken place and that Reince Priebus this was the implication the Ryan's previous had leaked his public disclosures no there's a couple problems with this number one you can't leak public disclosures in public so all his financial disclosures those became public like several days ago and it wasn't a leak but he accused somebody of a felony and then he directed the tweet outlines right well he directed it directly at Reince Priebus the reason he's angry is because it appears from Politico like scary movies profits from the sale of his hedge fund group are apparently he's still receiving those profits and he has not divested himself from his old firm and then scare Moochie went on CNN he said that putting rights rights his name at the end of tweet didn't mean that he wanted Ryan's investigate he said who's going to send the FBI and the DOJ information about the leaks and then he tagged grinds at the end and people are like whoa so you're reporting Ryan's previous to the DOJ and the FBI and apparently according to multiple media reports Ryan Lizza was one of them at the Washington Post apparently that's exactly what happened scare Moochie suspected that Reince Priebus was leaking on him and so he went outside to the DOJ and the FBI so scary Moochie went on national TV Ryan Lizza was on CNN and Skinner Moochie calls in and it gets really really weird it's really really weird so he says that he and prove its are like brothers who fight a lot some brothers are like Cain and Abel others fight but get along the implication of course is that they were the latter and maybe more like the former he says now if you want to talk about the chief of staff we've had we have had oz we've had differences when I said we were brothers from the podium that's because we're up on one another some brothers like amedeo Cain and Abel other brothers brothers can fight each other and get along I don't know if this is reparable or not that will be up to the president and then he and then he said that he was going to take down leakers he said the leakers are traitors in a century ago if you leaked it would have gotten you hung which is not really true and then he he says that he and Trump have a very very good idea of who the senior leakers are in the White House she said it's absolutely completely totally reprehensible and as you know from the Italian expression the fish things from the head down but I can tell you two fish that don't stink and that's in the president to Skinner Mookie doing exactly what Trump would want them to do which is kiss Trump's ass shamelessly in public and also hit people Trump liked the sport of this and so if you like that Skinner move she is really militant so it appears that wine is in serious trouble may in fact be on his way out Rhine says that he's sticking around of course everybody says they're sticking around and now there's a report that descendant is beginning to buck so this was always the question could there be a point where people say to where people say to Trump in the Senate and in Congress we're not going any further than this and it appears that the sessions thing and maybe the right thing these are these are a little bit of a breaking point from the session thing because if he gets rid of sessions the Senate has to approve a new Attorney General and senators are all friends obsessions remember sessions was part of their caucus until five minutes ago and so Lindsey Graham came out and he said listen if we if you fire Attorney General Sessions and Grassley said the two chuck Grassley from Iowa exit you're not getting a hearing there will be no new hearings I'm an attorney general you'll just have to serve with broad Rosenstein at the acting Attorney General and there's nothing you can do about it because we're not going to allow you to oust session so there's beginning to be a bit of a spine from Congress with regard to Trump and other edge stuff sessions is the right places to do all of this but there is a lot of chaos right now there is a bet that they're betting pools which one is going to be first to go is going to be Rimes is going to be session is going to be a Tom Price it's going to be Tillerson who is now on vaycay is it going to be Madison Madison talked about leaving and Trump isn't talking about asking him but the Pentagon released a statement today saying they weren't changing their transgender policy pending more information from the president which means they really haven't been coordinating on any of that you know all of this is just a big wake-up call to the Trump administration if Trump is capable of being awoken this is just the entire Republican base well not the entire Republican base the entire base in Congress the people who are capable of checking Trump saying listen to get your crap together please get your crap together and it gets worse than that okay so in a second I'm going to talk about what's happening with regard to Alaska because it's getting pretty rough where Trump is actually putting pressure on the last couple of different source the interior secretary Ryan's inky got the middle of it we'll explain what's happening there and we'll get to transgender policy and why everybody is wrong about everything we'll get to all of those things but for that has to go over to daily wired.com and

review we always appreciate it we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation okay so meanwhile while all this is going on inside the White House and Anthony Skinner Moochie continues to defend he says that people don't understand Trump right I mean it's the Trump lives in the White House in the elite stones and so sit down and shut up you're scaramouche you're doing that routine last night you'll see that the Bates and the majority of the American people and certainly all of the American people that voted form either don't care about the tweaks they find them funny they find them refreshing they don't generally know if it's right they don't overreact and Michael analyzing the way you guys actually not with the survey show shows most people don't think that they're appropriate and aren't big fans of him but he is playing well okay but you know what they're still voting for me still the president they voted for let's see that's a trial is that worth living as an answer every time I checked he's living in the residence up here and really torn okay so this constant refrain that Trump can do whatever he wants because you want that doesn't mean that he's governing well and this is a problem Skinner movie though this is really more about scaramouche auditioning for Trump a lot of the campaign has been a lot of the administration has now been about showing from the oil and showing in the air a tough guy and all the scaramouche he uses this kind of language and I think from loved it Skinner Moochie says I don't stab people in the back I stab people in the front what I don't like about Washington is people do not let you know how they feel they're very nice to your face and then they take a shiv or a machete and they stab it in your back I don't like it you know Anthony I like Romo I'm a Wall Street guy and I'm more of a front stabbing person and I'd rather tell people directly how I feel about this okay so this is a kind of talk that Trump likes the question is is it going to be effective so another example of something being ineffective so Trump is trying to put pressure on Lisa Murkowski to vote for the Senate bill that's fine I mean he should put pressure on Lisa Murkowski to vote for some form of repeal I mean they just keep shrinking down what exactly it is they're going to vote for and I was on the hill this morning that several Congress people they're deeply frustrated with the Republicans in the Senate who won't vote for any form of repeal at all so Trump is exactly right to go after Murkowski but apparently last night Trump and apparently previs and Skinner Moochie they they all sort of made threats toward the toward the Alaskan senator they said that we're going to start reregulate or at least not deregulating the Alaskan energy industry unless you give us your vote and then Murkowski immediately responded by refusing to see any of the nominees for the undersecretary positions over the Interior Department where Ryan's Enki is working so it's just battle royale between Trump and everybody right now it's a war of all against all the reason that this matters the reason that this is bad is because what we're watching right now it is not just important to do the right thing in politics and in terms of doing some of the right things you have to do the right thing in the right way the reason the right way matters is because what happens after you do the same right so Obama thought he did the right thing with Obamacare but the way he did it was the wrong way and that's what led to 70 percent disapproval ratings on Obama care even though now people you know by and large are largely positive about Obama care the same thing is happening with regard to the internet salutes with the poll show the same thing is happening with regard to single-payer health care and like if Trump goes too far on health care and he does it in a way that people don't appreciate they're going to hate no matter what he proposes how it got done and there's going to be blowback and that actually ends up helping Democrats because remember if you do this wrong and people react badly they're going to vote for Democrats in 2018 and 2020 and then the Democrats will have their shot at reimplemented the Democrats are becoming very open about their agenda here so if you do it wrong and you hand at the time to the other guy then they're not going to be shy about cramming that baton down your throat here is Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois says listen whatever happens here we're going to move closer to single-payer on the other side and Senator Durbin this is Eddie Glaude let's pin out a little bit there you the Democratic Party just released its better deal to kind of offer a vision of their policy initiatives over over the next few years there's clam Derek's clamoring among the base for single single-payer how in the course of this debate will you respond to those of us on the left who really think that thing or pet single-payer might be the answer to the health care issue this is a last gasp but we're going through now is the last gasp for private health insurance in America as far as I'm concerned if we can't make this work with the private health insurance industry we start moving closer to a Medicare model from my point of view Medicare has a lot of positive of things to offer the American people how many folks say darn it now I qualify for Medicare most of them say hooray I don't have to worry about pre-existing conditions I've paid into it I can get the best hospitals and doctors and I have peace of mind that's what people are looking for in health insurance and if it is a point the Democrats are the Democrats are already moving for less this is the point Democrats are already moving to less if you do something that makes a good policy unpopular that is almost worse than doing nothing at all and this is my problem with had from dragged out the transgender policy change that he did yesterday the fact that Trump did it via tweet poisoned the well a little bit because it made it difficult to defend imagine that instead of doing that Trump had gone to General Madison said you had understand it was six months study I want you to accelerate the study and then I want you to come out with results and I want you to tell the world why do you think the transgender people serving in the military is bad for the military and then Maddox came forward and said listen as someone you served my entire life in the military as somebody who cares deeply about unit cohesion it's important that we not do this very difficult for the left to take the opposing viewpoint instead from tweets out something and everybody runs for the hills and it looks most of all disrespectful to people who are transgender and currently serving in the military now listen I am NOT I mean if you listen to the show at all or watch the show at all you know that I believe the transgenderism is a gender dysphoria is mental illness and they are some ring from a severe mental disorder and as a general rule bringing in groups of people who have severe mental disorders in the military is not a strong move is it point to David French former military guy and that he makes over a national review that when you look at military policy it's sort of like when you look at insurance policy we in regular life when we deal with each other on a one-to-one basis we expect to be treated as individuals not as members of groups but when you are doing actuarial selections right when you are doing an insurance table they don't have to get to know every aspect of you they look at your age they look at your prior health and they say okay based on the information we have there's a good likelihood you'll be dead in 30 years so here's here's we're going to charge you that's how they do this and that's not about devaluing you as a human being it's using probability theory to gauge what's going to happen the same thing happens when you decide which groups to recruit for the military and who should be allowed in if you had a group among which there was a significant I'm talking forty percent rate of schizophrenia you can bet that group would have a hard time being recruited into the military again it could manifest at any time and you don't want to be in a position where this entire group of people are getting skits are seeing the symptoms of schizophrenia on the battlefield when they're under pressure the same thing is true for gender dysphoria so all of the virtue signaling from left is really ridiculous but it was made possible in part because Trump did the right thing the wrong way it's important for term to start doing the right thing the right way you can see the reporters virtual signaling yesterday at the White House every reporter felt the necessity to get up and speak openly and passionately about transgender soldiers in the military apparently they're about 4,000 active duty transgender soldiers in the military that seems high to me I'm not sure how many of those people are open about their transgenderism but in any case here the reporter is just virtru signalling one after another is the president considering looking at any kind of policy about transgender people serving the White House identities tried to make a decision on transgender people service military no once again this is a decision based on what was best for the military and a military cohesion and on the counsel of his national security team thank you so the impression they were a little bit flat little bit flat footed by the president's tweet so I understand that this was and has been to last couple weeks of conversation here specifically about TRICARE coverage for transgender procedures and it suddenly evolved after the president to then go on Twitter to announce this man and as you already told us the White House and the Pentagon are gonna have to lawfully implement that typically when you have announcement of this magnitude all that work has been done at the procedural level between the bureaucracy of the Pentagon in the White House why wasn't any of that work done and why was the Pentagon caught so surprised this morning by the president's tweet some yeah as I said before that the president's national security team was part of this consultation you mentioned yourself that there have been ongoing conversations when this one smaller president makes it back right when the president made the decision yesterday the Secretary of Defense was immediately informed as were the rest of the national security team we couldn't stop there I mean bottom line is that again if Trump had gone to Madison like mattis be the tip of the spear or if we laid out a long essay or if he had laid out if you had given cerrado be Sanders talking points all of this could have been avoided instead all you're seeing all over the TV is Caitlyn Jenner angry at Trump now imagine if you want to paint room general versus trunk or Caitlyn Jenner versus Mad Dog Madison when's that public relations battle but here's Caitlyn Jenner doing his routine and and Trump does not look the better for we're on this Caitlyn Jenner tweeted there are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in US military fighting for all of us what happened to your promise to fight for them now remember again it would be very difficult for Caitlyn Jenner to make that case if it were general mattis who had actually laid out this policy she's doing the right thing the wrong way is sometimes even worse than doing nothing and that's not again a rip on policy choices that Trump made with regarded transgender soldiers I'm fully in agreement because I think that most military minds who put aside to political correctness understand that putting a group of people in harm's way who are 40 percent lifetime suicide rate 90 percent of military veterans who are transgender have been diagnosed with a mental illness after leading the service you know none of this bodes well for building the best fighting force in the world and again you have small units of soldiers on the front line day after day after day that's not exactly a pressure free environment if they have a 44 transgender people have 40 percent lifetime suicide rate in the United States which is a pretty welcoming environment try it when you're a soldier in Afghanistan I mean that's just not going to go well so again I think Trump can be right but he has to get over doing it the wrong way and it's actually a deeply important thing so before I get some things I like and some things I hate I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at blankets so you have a lot of stuff going on today I have a lot of stuff going on today I justify it on the hill and I'm doing the show and I did a bunch of interviews I still had time to read a book I don't have time to read a book because I was using my blinka staff while I walked the blinkin staff allows you to essentially sample you get a summary of or 2,000 was the best-selling non-fiction books transformed into this powerful packets you can listen to in 50 minutes it's not a full summary of the book because it doesn't go through every point of the book but it picks the most important points from any of these books and then gives it to you so in 15 minutes you get the main point of a book which is great because the fact is even if you were to read a 500 page book you're probably not going to obtain more than three or four minutes worth of material on it anyway so having having it boiled down into 15-minute forms that you can get the main gist of it we do it every day in our lives we should be doing it with books - that's a blink it is for we're talking great books like why nation sale again 600 page book boiled down into 15 minutes you can get into 2 to 3 books a day writing it through two or three books a day just by going to blankest right now go to blink it's calm bli n ki st blink is calm / been to start your free trial or get three months off your yearly plan again it's blankets calm / bend and go over and check it out and and you will not be disappointed it is fantastic you get that free trial three months off your yearly plan when you join today everybody that I know who's used it loves it I was talking to Dana Perino the other day and she said she's been using blankets because because you heard it on the show it's just great so make sure that you check out blankets actually congressman said his wife uses blankets now because because of listening to the show so make sure that you go there use the promo code that lets them know that we sent you plus it means that you're going to get that discount so pretty pretty awesome okay so time for some things I like and some things that I hate so things that I like so I did testify on the hill today I'll have clips of it tomorrow we'll play them on the show it was a lot of fun something I've never done before the panel was an eighteen Strawson from the ADL is on my right and then Adam Carolla was on my left and there were two administrators a fellow whose name I can't recall from Evergreen State College another very end a fellow named uh last name Lawrence who was the Dean at Brandeis University and networks for the anti-defamation league and I had some basic thoughts first of all it's great the representative Jim Jordan from the fourth District of Ohio he put the thing together and it was just fabulous because it's taking on a much needed issue that has been ignored for too long which is a threat to free speech that's happening on campus so good for representative Jordan good for the other members the committee including ranking Democrats for getting together on this thing putting it together it's it was interesting because I think that some of the main issues were sort of skirted over with regard to free speech so the main issue which is that people should be allowed to say what they want on campus speakers should be allowed to speak everyone basically agreed with that but there are several people on the left side of the aisle that kept saying we'll just leave it to administrators just leave it to administrators and I could say there has to be some sort of ramification for administrators if they do not do their job if they use the restrictions they have available to them to politically buy it the discussion by banning certain speakers and I didn't really have a chance to say but I wanted to that if you have a administration where if I come to speak they released a letter to the entire student body saying this guy doesn't represent us but then you have kind of PC codes come to speak and there's no letter that goes out that's a chilling effect on the expression of a different point of view there should be a blanket rule on public university campuses that if you're going to have any speaker that the university will say this person does not represent us under story end of story but there's this attempt to to promote sensitivity that is in conflict with the the notion of free speech because free speech is not about sensitivity it's about suck it up buttercup and there and the left wants to sort of have it both ways so the well it's was Beth in was to watch how the Democratic attempted to turn the hearing from what about administrative malfeasance on campus into a hearing about hate crimes on campus and about people who are who are they kept bringing up this case of this this young black woman who is the student body president over at American University Taylor Dunford and I think I'm pronouncing the last name correctly and and she was finishes left the student president and then apparently around campus people were stringing up nooses with bananas in them and they had they'd put on the bananas a reference sorority that she attended I don't I'd never seen the story before so I really didn't know much about it so I'll take it if they value obviously that's horrible and the administration looked into it and the administration is going to do something about it and that's the point and I did say this too - I think it's represent of Eleanor Norton Holmes Holmes Norton I believe I said to her there is a massive difference between individuals on campus doing terrible things which we all agree you know if you give it a crime which is in an actress saying something offensive but you're actively what you're doing can be interpreted or should be interpreted by a reasonable person as as an actual threat of violence then that's crime but if the idea here is that that's the same thing as an administration that's attempting to crack down on free speech it is not so there's that thing to watch as Democrats try to redirect this into the alt-right is the real threat on campus okay it's not okay it's not the fact is that the threats of violence are in the main not coming from the right on campus because the right doesn't really exist on campus or at least if it does it exists in very small measure there's a very small group of all right people who may be terrible on campus but that is certainly not a vast bevy of problems on campus and I'm speaking as someone who's Jewish and there have been a lot of hate crimes you know so-called hate crimes against Jews and on campus a lot of those by the way are coming from what so it was fun to watch as the Democrats tried to twist away from just saying you should be allowed to say what you want on campus enough of the stupid diversity training enough of the administrative malfeasance let's focus on letting everybody speak freely they were very upset actually about this Wisconsin bill that is passing is passed through the assembly over there in Wisconsin largely on the heels of my lecture University of Wisconsin Madison where a bunch of people invaded the lecture stood in front of the stage and then insisted on not allowing me to speak and the administration allowed that to go forward the Democrats kept tripping on this and the problem is the bill itself doesn't say that the bill is is meant to prevent people from preventing other people's speech instead the way they interpret is was they're trying to shut down protests no one's trying to shut down protests now maybe have promised the wording of the bill but the idea that you that protest allowable protest involves shutting down other people's free speech is just asinine I have some ideas about the workings of the committee itself and what Republicans should do better because I think some Republicans were great and some Republicans were not as strong Democrats universally were on message with regard to what they're attempting to push and also how they were pursuing their question they're also some great moments but we'll go through that much more in detail tomorrow and we can actually cut the audio for you because we literally just finished and then came over here to arenít foundation our friends at Heritage allowed us to broadcast from there today so that's great okay time for a quick thing that I hate and then we'll do the big idea and leave so things I hate for people who say that all Muslims in the United States are moderate that there's no such thing as well happy funded math that's scary and that we should never worry about radical Islamic extremism inside the United States this tape is now murdered a california imam is quite prominent who has who's appearing to call for the annihilation of you'd and apparently they're not two of them who were doing this here is tape of this california imam talking about the jews Lohani who I knew fundamental mister hot today Rob Muhammad immunity I'll have judgments a little Muslim Jerry or she'll hide behind authoritarian or so job yeah most intelligent reasonable Muslim a certain haha yeah Abdullah Linea podium sweetly want a or do not need more now no Laurel curator Apple challenge any that the time will come the loss our would not take place to the Muslims fight the Jews Romanian solution for invested in up so say your ability Muslim mrs. Cornell Arsenal in Macedon of swimming a dinner filio a la la la Li la campaña what I wanted an upside asteroid emoji Allahu Liman Marinetti human s where the arena see him are je veux pas de logic logic embedded Roxie mother is what a cancer again cell for Nia Lauren how do you must do the love soil but I mean okay madam he says Allah count them one by one annihilate them down to the very last ones do not spare any of them this is a lot like a lot of the sermons that are out of the Middle East it was posted to the Islamic Center of Davis's YouTube channel on Friday the sermon last about two and a half minutes and that remember the al-aqsa mosque is only open because the the Jews allow it to be open and it was Palestinians who I got the story wrong the other day slightly miss Hollis Indians who decided that would be worthwhile to step step to Druze Israeli police officers and then we're shot for their trouble and one of them one of the attackers is still alive apparently sadly because evil people should stab people should die but this is you know the idea that Islamic extremism is a tiny tiny percentage of the population worldwide is not true in the United States thank God it's so fringe element but across the world it is certainly not French certainly not in the Palestinian Authority and when you're seeing this kind of stuff set in the United States it should be slightly disturbing okay I want to say something in the big idea so on Thursdays we have the big idea the big idea is where we take a concept you may have heard about but you don't know that much about in politics let me break it down for you so that you can use it yourself so one of the things that you hear a lot whenever there's a constitutional case that comes up is you will hear that justices will say things like this law had to be we had to apply strict scrutiny to this law or intermediate scrutiny to this law or rational basis review these are legal tests to determine what rationale the government has to come up with in order to regulate something so for example strict scrutiny that's invoked when there's a fundamental right at stake so there's a First Amendment violation but through the law there the law violates the First Amendment the question is is that allowed or not because the First Amendment is not unlimited right I can't like walk into your house and just start shouting there's a compelling state interest in preventing me from walking into your house and shouting at you strict scrutiny is invoked here strict scrutiny is invoked on a fundamental right it's take the government can only regulate these fundamental rights when there is a quote/unquote compelling state interest and the regulation is narrowly tailored as possible and one of the big questions in the upcoming masterpiece cake shop case is going to be whether the discrimination law is tailored closely enough to prevent the violation of the fundamental right to practice your religion intermediate scrutiny is the next level this is any this is this is usually related to discrimination on the basis of gender or sex so if there's a law that says that you have to have separate bathrooms for men and women for example that would fall under intermediate scrutiny you have to show the government is allowed to show that it can discriminate on the basis of sex for an important government objective and that the Act is substantially related to achieving that objective and finally there's rational basis review where the person challenging the law has to show that the government has no real interest in law or policy there's no link between the interest in the challenged law now here is the problem here these kinds of terms thrown around especially on the left they like to throw these terms around what they mean something they don't mean anything the first rule of constitutional law is that it has nothing to do with the Constitution these are made up terms they are made up by by judges and they are twisted to fit the facts we will see cases that ought to fall under intermediate scrutiny all under strict scrutiny you'll see cases that are intermediate scrutiny cases that are treated as though there's strict scrutiny cases these malleable terms of art don't mean anything and it's dangerous and excuse me when you see justices attempting to apply vague standards to the law instead of just the words of the Constitution themselves this is why I think the Clarence Thomas is very load to use these sorts of terms he's exactly right as soon as you start talking about what sort of scrutiny is appropriate you're now living in Judge land you're not looking in Constitution land anymore so anytime you hear someone say well that deserves strict scrutiny just think to yourself I have no idea what that means and why don't you actually tell me what the Constitution has to say about this particular issue don't be fooled by the legal jargon it's this is pretty much meaningless legal jargon that allows people to stretch to their their perceived wanted conclusion at any point okay we'll be back tomorrow now look back in our beautiful la Studios and I will be doing the mailbag as well so make sure that you check that out Plus will be playing excerpts from my testimony on Capitol Hill which is a lot of fun but we'll do all of that i'm ben shapiro this is the bench bureau show
