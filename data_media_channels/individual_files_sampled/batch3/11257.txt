hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle two Americas too intensely charged in opposing news narratives new cable news networks reflect these divisions or rather function as triggers intensifying cultural divide also what has happened to journalism is it now a profession inhabited by hacks and the politically possessed crosstalking America divided I'm joined by Magus Rob table in New York he's a political pundit and journalist contributing to the Huffington Post also in New York we have Julio Rivera he is the editorial director of reactionary times and a Newsmax columnist and in Los Angeles we have ron pollack own he is a comedian a frequent guest on the jimmy dore show and the young turks as well as host of his own streaming show get your news on with Ron all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it Ron you got up early as for this program so you are elected to answer the first question here you know a great deal of my time i watch cable news I try to watch as much of all of them to get a variety of them and you know I it's obvious to say that we live in two very very different Americas the two Americas that don't know each other at all anymore so when I look at the cable news networks I mean do they reflect this cultural divide are they really intensifying it I mean are do they magnify it because you certainly we get that feeling look again MSNBC and Fox go ahead I think that they they definitely intensify a divide yes do they reflect what's really going on in the States or amidst the people that live here I would say absolutely not and to the point where I try very hard to no longer even use the phrase mainstream media okay I try to refer to it to what it is I call it the corporate media because that's what it is it's owned by a small elite group of corporations they have an agenda they have a narrative they have certain things that they're not allowed to talk about but as far as the division goes I mean yeah and you you brought up the memo as a for instance and I think that's a very good example you know I'm one side yet at MSNBC trying to make it out like oh this is absolutely nothing then on the other side you know and on Fox News for instance you had oh this is absolutely everything and the truth is is that that you know there are things to learn in every given rhetorical event so yeah there's certainly an agenda but really it's just most of the time political theater yeah between the most elite among us isn't really reflecting what's going on in the United States and more and more people are disenfranchised well that's what media that's why people come to us another alternative media Jimmy Dore Iran very often and I really much we enjoy and he said progressive I consider myself a conservative but I find him a reasonable person I find you a reasonable person to talk to it Rob more or less the same question to you because it seems to me if you look at MSNBC and then you look at Fox basically what both are doing is they're they're reacting to a status quo that is changing and I think that rattles both of them okay because we're still reeling from the election of Donald Trump and the media is trying to or not trying to adjust to that political reality so it seems to me that you know the before the media horizon there was there the terrain was there people understood it but it's changing changed very radically since then and I think that sees the extremes and I deduced the network's that I've just mentioned go ahead Rob well when Ron was talking about corporations I mean what are we doing we're going for ratings because they're gonna make more money and I used to be three times a week guest on Fox representing I would say what I called myself as a sane liberal and as opposed to a knee-jerk liberal or a complete jerk liberal those are my different types of liberals but I'm gonna harken back to a book written in 1973 that's always been one of my favorites and it's it's really proved to pre chien news from no nowhere by Edward J Epstein and he was talking about how television news was terrible because they don't actually provide you real news yet they're getting fed information from big corporations and from PR departments and so what I find offensive is I actually got into little shoving not a shoving match but a little verbal jousting years ago with Matt Lauer because he gave me this I'm a journalist kind of thing at a function and he's a journalist like I'm Tom Brady and we we've forgotten what real Journal and we don't have shoe leather on the sidewalk journalism anymore but we may not be able to have to have that because who's going to pay for it so where do we in effect get real news from accept sources and leaks that's a good point Holyoke you know and it seems to me that it has got down to just hacks because as I said in the introduction of the program is that you know I could I'll be very open with I'm very sympathetic to like God Tucker Carlson for example I think he's a pretty reasonable person and he has opposing people on all the time on his program but if you look at like Hannity and you look at Rachel Maddow I mean they never let anything that disturbs their world in you know interet and I find that really disturbing because that's just basically giving red meat to your viewers you're not teaching them anything you're just reaffirming it's an affirmation process in watching the two that I just mentioned here and I don't think that they use a whole lot of news it so enormous amount of spin go ahead Julio well no not necessarily I mean this is the one thing I would say and to speak to you know our Rachel Maddow and her colleague over at MSNBC Mika Brzezinski saying and she was quoted as saying we have to control what people think I mean I think it needs to be fact-based I think there is an extreme lack of integrity in reporting at this point I could the truth of the matter is that outlets like Fox and News max are actually reporting facts things that have gone on and if you look at Donald Trump when he was on his asian tour he struck an energy deal they closed our trade deficit with with China by about eighty billion dollars if you looked at the news that day the news was the speculation that this Russia probe supposedly was going to shift to Trump directly and now we're looking at this in February still hasn't yielded anything substantial that they can pin to Trump so it's always been about trying to make the Trump administration look bad from the left and there is a little bit of a defense mechanism going on in right-leaning media but it's usually a lot more fact-based coming from the right yeah well I would agree I mean we on the for example I mean when you look at CNN and MSNBC they're just in denial okay I mean you know one hour they say it's a danger to national security and then when it's released they say it's nothing here move along nothing to see I mean they're in denial here let me go to Ron in Los Angeles I mean in that sense I did agree with Julio I mean they don't even want to address the content of the memo for example I read it it's very interesting it's something I think it's very very important but you have the liberal corporatist media I will take your term they just dismiss it out of hand because again it endangers and what they believe is the status quo and they have the right they and the privilege to tell the world how to think I want tell the American public out of thing go ahead run well yeah I mean I'm I'm a very progressive guy and I used to really love Rachel Maddow I used to consider her a diamond in the rough but recently you know I mean I say if you watch Rachel Maddow Show and you take a shot of vodka every time she says the word Russia you're gonna be I think the average person would probably be dead within 20 minutes the media has a very the media has a very corporate agenda I'm going to try that tool I know you did and crosstalk will not be held right on trend anyone doing that okay disclaimer on at the end of the program finish a bran go ahead thank you but yeah I mean that they have their corporate you know I'll give another for instance you know MSNBC is owned by Comcast you've not seen an honest report on net neutrality from MSNBC you haven't really seen it in any of the corporate media but especially not from them because they're owned by Comcast a very anti net neutrality company you know when dapple was going on all of the corporate media Fox News CNN MSNBC they're all funded in large part by oil and oil and gas companies so of course they're not going to tell you what's going on in in terms of a water protest where do you hear about that you hear about that from the journalists that are on the ground you know Rahn on that Goodman's I'm not like that on that point I do remember watching across the board and almost one of those rare moments of unity everybody said it's important period we didn't get anything more than that okay I learned more about net net neutrality listening to the Jimmy Dore show it was an excellent program on net neutrality learned an enormous amount they thank you okay Rob let me let me go back to you one of the things that I find really disturbing in our political discourse is that everyone if you host someone they're a traitor they act in a treasonous way I mean and I criticize Donald Trump for that and I certainly I certainly criticize MSNBC and CNN for peddling the same thing go ahead Rob well one of the things that really used to infuriate me when I was a regular contributor to Fox I've always been a Democrat is I had people that would suddenly contact me on Facebook or via Twitter are they or an email and say I can't believe you're a traitor and you're on Fox and then I will would respond and say well did you see me when I was on this week no I won't watch it well then how do you know what I'm saying or what I'm contributing and really as a result of Fox I've met a lot of interesting conservative people that I never would have met who follow me on Twitter or I've I've spoken to on Sirius radio and I really enjoy the interaction between us one of the things I think that we have to make the distinction about also is that there are news shows and there are opinion shows the problem is is that the opinion shows have taken over and the news shows many of them are letting too many opinions creep in and it can be with a raised eyebrow or an inflection and that's wrong if you're supposed to be a reporter and you're giving the news and you're supposed to let the viewer or the reader Rob so let me jump in here because you know me before we go to the brink but I tend to think particularly with this Russia gate thing and it was liberal corporate stations they facts get in the way with a spin for them and I think that's why you get so few facts I mean the memo the contents of the memo wasn't really discussed but it was the timing of it well we know we have the memo we can read it we can talk about it no okay but we'll have to wait for the Democratic one I mean this is what I irritate Smee gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on the media and their divide in America State with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Welch remind you were discussing the media and the divide in America Noli let me go to you in New York here I asked Rob about using the word trader and being considered treacherous or treasonous here it's very difficult to have a conversation with someone after you've called them that okay and and this is what I find very dangerous I mean I can give you a real-life example I'm you know from the great saga called Russia Russia Russia okay I know all of the name calling of leaders around the world and then how do you sit down and talk okay and I think that this is what's really foolish about journalism and you get that's hyperventilation that you know you get the the adrenaline rush and you feel really great but then when you you know think about what you just said and you're supposed to be some kind of playing some kind of public roles you know adding value to the public sphere and then you call he's a traitor you're a traitor you know it doesn't get down to it's not disagreeing with someone now it is you're morally unacceptable that's not what we should do in journalism go ahead Julio well I think that the problem is the word moderate has become a dirty word I think that the left has gone far to the left I think the right has gone far to the right even to the point where you have Republican a ton of Republican infighting I mean we've got phrases like rhino sellout Republicans any time you know they want to make a deal with the Democrats so that's kind of the world that we're operating in right now but unfortunately it's being fueled I think more or less because the larger and the larger percentage of mainstream media sources although that's kind of a dirty word that we don't always like to use are so skewed against the president you know they've been trying to undermine President Trump this entire time so that's why they're reporting right now it isn't really necessarily reporting it's a hundred percent spin it's almost like their news programs have become opinion programs and there isn't really a lot of you know let's say moderate or middle-of-the-road news that exists anymore in America you know Ron I saw trey gowdy on Face the Nation the country needs more people like that you may disagree with his politics but at least he listened to hard questions and he acknowledged some give-and-take which I was so so refreshing to see it was a really remarkable moment but you know what what I get if we compare let's say Hannity and and Rachel Maddow you know both of them have one thing in common one phrase our democracy is at stake our democracy is being threatened but for very very different ways again maybe I'm off on this here but it's the status quo that the new status quo that's coming into being that they don't seem to understand here and we you know you we have a FB I that has gone broke it's been gotten wrong for a long time it's nothing new it's just they they the curtain has revealed this this has been going on a long time dick I doesn't anybody remember J Edgar Hoover I mean I do okay that's a child at least okay so I mean you know using this you know our democracy is is under threat III find that really hard to believe in and I find it very disingenuous go ahead wrong I'm a hundred percent with you and in fact whenever somebody says to me hey Trump hijacked our democracy you know I don't like Trump but my response is well we were kind of overdue to look into a new one anyway so maybe that's a blessing in disguise and you hit the nail on the head with the status quo comment Peter what nobody really wants to talk about in the corporate media is that the status quo is broken in Italy oh I would say to you you know I think on a lot of issues we probably don't see eye to eye but I think that the reason that moderate has become a quote-unquote dirty word isn't necessarily because being moderate is right or wrong but because the status quo is so completely broken and people are disenfranchised as a response to that you know Donald Trump ran on this idea of some kind of outsider some kind of you know guy that was really going to disrupt the status quo you know and whether folks bought that or not you know I personally didn't I don't think that's what he is at all but that's what he ran on and that's what he sold and people bought into that because they're so tired of the status quo and neoliberalism okay well a robbery has done it on some levels though continue go ahead Julio I'm say he has done it we've seen as four keep going Julio go ahead go ahead go ahead to New York go ahead own okay I'm so I'm sorry I apologize it's the delay I'm sorry nobody has done that on some levels and I think that that's the reason that why there's been so much opposition to him you know it because we're gonna finally I think and they're gonna do this to themselves I think the elements that we're anti-trump are gonna lead to you know uncovering a lot of the things that went on during the Obama administration you know things that were conducted by Hillary Clinton things that were conducted by Barack Obama the Justice Department you know on Loretta Lynch Eric Holder all this information is going to come out as a result of their cry babying and being anti-trump because he was ultimately seen as a threat because he's not really necessarily in bed with a lot of these people that were the status quo for me you bring up you bring up a really interesting point and let me go to rob right now because it's something that I've been mulling over quite a bit or and again it's this memo issue here is it you know it seems to me and I read the memo very carefully and I find it very believable okay I've been unfortunately I'm have to follow this story 24/7 is forced on you it's and it's a fictitious story but what is in fictitious is malfeasance at the highest level of the DOJ and the FBI I mean I am convinced of that and I thought the the the memo was very well laid out a very interesting narrative but Rob the problem is is the mainstream media just denies it and and I find that and this is what the part of this cultural civil war that is brewing in the United States is that you're going to you do have a part of the population of the public that is aware of these what I think are reasonable facts to believe and then you have the corporate us here in the media denying it and and I think that you can't it can't that can't be elevated in the air for very long because people gonna say well I mean Flynn is gonna go to jail metaphor it's gonna go to jail but you know Comey lied Clinton lied to the FBI and they're not going to go to jail and at that point there's gonna be a train wreck go ahead rob well first of all I think we're getting into way too much supposition which is a big problem right now in the media media shouldn't be acting on either side be it right or left or whomever absolutely jury and executioner absolutely and and and in comparative okay and I just as an aside I'm sorry but I've been chuckling about this when I J Edgar Hoover got mentioned I thought what kind of nickname would Trump come up with him cross-dressing J Edgar but anyway I'm gonna get a little tangential here Peter okay to Ron and Julio but one of the things that really bugs me and I feel that people who do what we do at least at the highest echelon and I'm talking about the highest paid people like a Maddow or or Sean Hannity if I were king I would force them to get on the 3rd Avenue bus with me where it originates way down in the Bowery and ride it all the way up to one hundred and twenty-fifth Street a couple of times a week because I like to do that I get stories there I meet people there and I interact with the actual actual public that I then speak to on radio television or via a column and I think that if you're gonna call yourself a journalist and you don't do that and instead you ride around in a limousine and make your thirty million a year or whatever it's going to be I don't understand how you feel that you can aptly communicate with the pike so I think we have a big problem they're angry it's kind of like being a professional athlete now I mean are you really in touch with your fan base yeah I mean Ron being being a journalist and television is just another word for being a high paid celebrity okay I suppose you know they're gonna have their own you know celebrity Awards where everybody shows up okay but you know that this is one of the things that I am I I find worrisome is that you have a corporate media that has no interest in the public whatsoever they have a bottom line they have their donors they have the their sponsors and all that I mean they for them that system is perfected here but they get further and further away because I I'm convinced that it was the the corporatist media that elected Donald Trump by calling the rest of us deplorable in running with that and sneak smearing at us and laughing at us and talking down to us okay and I think that I'm from the Midwest people don't like to be talked that way from both coasts okay it's gonna happen again in 2020 if they don't change their tune go ahead run yeah you know I I don't disagree with that I mean I I do think that the corporatist media did elect Donald Trump and this is uh you know just the whole model you know I say that if you want a democratic experiment to be successful and you have the media structure that we have in the United States that will be a lot like wanting to open a gourmet restaurant and cooking exclusively with spam and no other ingredient I mean it's just not it's just not the right kind of structure to have the society we want the one silver lining and all that though is that I mean people are leaving cable television news in droves I mean the confidence in cable news gets lower and lower every year there's academic studies that come out constantly there was a Harvard study recently that revealed that what the media talks about and what people actually care about is so disproportional it's about about 75 percent to 6 percent yeah and that's why people like me have a job that's why well you know that's why there's shows on YouTube that that are sustainable now yes we're so thirsty of upper actual news and they're finding it I'll give you a mark dice I mean his daily video I mean he can he's competing with the major networks this one guy okay I mean the Jimmy Dore does very well at anytime a Jordan Peterson is on anyone's program they're the hits goes through the ceiling here I I'm agreeing with Ron let me go to rah let me go to wrong because I think you know people are so desperate to hear different voices and stop having spin pounded down your throat all the time go ahead Rob well the last time I was on the show what we discuss is one of my favorite lines from the classic film broadcast news is Albert Brooks says you know we're in trouble when we become more important than the story and yes there is way too much spin and we're also it's it's it becomes so much about ratings and I started in scripted television on comedy shows and you know it I learned early you know well it doesn't matter if you're funny or if it's good what what are the ratings and what are the nielsen say and so you're striving for that rather than ultimately delivering the news or the real story and again from both sides I have have certain sources I've used and loved why have they been wrong but in the first week of December I sat down and had had an interview with with an attorney who's really plugged in and he was telling me to in two weeks Kushner is going to be indicted well you know guys we've run out of time I certainly miss Walter Cronkite many thanks to my guests in New York and in Los Angeles and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
