Donald Trump the man who started the Obama birther conspiracy thanks to a tip from an extremely credible source apparently doesn't like anonymous sources anymore this morning he tweeted the fact is that many anonymous sources don't even exist they are fiction made up by the fake news reporters he added later when you see anonymous source stop breeding the story it is fiction speaking of fiction Trump used to go by the fake names John Barron and John Miller to spin negative stories and shop positive stories about himself with New York news newspapers the panel is still here mike lupica as well guys this is the and we've seen so many instances of this this is the I'm rubber and you're glue theory of Donald Trump politics it's projection whatever he sees whatever he does himself he assumes other people are doing he lies he used a lot of reporters so he presumes all reporters are lying Rick what do you think well having grown up here and read the tabloids my whole life I mean you can actually go online and listen to Trump pretending to be his own publicist that's John Baron or John Miller and you know what he would call up about he'd call up and say every girl in New York wants to date Donald Trump he's the most handsome guy he's the most popular guy and you hear him in his own voice seeing this it is really extraordinary what you also saw by the by the 90s nobody would do any story involving Donald Trump because they he was an anonymous source about himself telling everybody how great he was do you guys want to hear him actually doing this okay because we do have that soundbite here is John Miller talking to People magazine in 1991 mike lupica I mean I guess he's sort of trying to change his voice in that but it certainly still sounds like Donald Trump no Katie Maggie Haberman tweeted about this today the great Pete Hamill was my editor at The Daily News back in the 1990's and apparently Donald didn't think of himself as an anonymous source when he would call up his John Millar he a guest saw himself as a non anonymous anonymous source where he tried to convince everybody that women just walking down the street would begin throwing articles of clothing at him but another thing that Pete always said was never use irony in an underdeveloped country and in this case its Washington DC because when he said that about anonymous sources today I want to say oh that's a good one you were serious wait it's not just a non-adhesive he's a fake source than that fake he it's fake news in that this is going on at a time that the White House is briefing on background and won't let what would any other White House be a rather normal briefing that you would attribute to actual people they insist that it be anonymous because they don't want to be seen as talking to reporters and even when it's semi official like in the briefing room with several people and they each have positions it's anonymous it can't be attributed to any one person so perhaps the White House press corps should stop picking people on background make them go on the record wouldn't be a bad idea at all I mean there are reasons to be on background and the reasons are that you have a responsibility to get accurate information to the American public and if you trust the source and these things are built on relationships then that's something that we feel we're compelled to report and obviously the first choice is always to get people on the record there are certain cases in which that's not well that's also just be clear about something it's not just anonymous people calling up and saying hey I've got a hot tip on the president let me tell you what I think is going on these are people who name themselves you know who they are and you've built as a reporter a reporter with that person and you can decide whether or not their information is legitimate or is trustworthy and you can back it up with other sources that you go to they're not anonymous people they're named people they're just unnamed in that article and those people are doing so in many cases because they simply can't take the injustice they're seeing anymore they simply don't trust anyone in leadership to do the right thing and they feel compelled to tell a story those are the people doing it for perhaps the right motives or in this case of this White House they're just trying to undercut everybody else because it's a Viper's nest point Katie one of the things that journalistic organism organizations should do that they don't do now is be more transparent about anonymous sources and on background instead of saying this an anonymous source from the White House said in a briefing set up by the NSC and a phone call at 3:00 p.m. that lasted 45 minutes to White House officials on background said X or Y that's a good point part of the problem is people don't regular people like unlike us don't have media literacy about these things they don't know that's how it operates so Trump can say that's an anonymous source and people just think of a shady person calling from the inside because Trump doesn't have media literacy so when he goes out and he attacks the media for the various things that he thinks are unfair he taps into that with the American public so it's it can seem somewhat legitimate are familiar and what's interesting is I think we all in at least in the print media have changed it we will now begin a story this is based on conversations with 22 White House officials and former officials because we do want to give the public a sense that we're just not sitting making stuff up there are real people that's where our reporters do all day long they get off the phone they come visit people they talk to people so I think it is probably a healthy thing I love your idea but at least to give them a frame and start describing the numbers and the sorts of people that you're talking about and Washington posta start doing that other publication journalism should start being a mandatory class and it's it meant early civics in elementary school all the way through high school that's my opinion my class to you and I want to redo this tweet this is Donald Trump in 2012 an extremely credible source has called my office and told me that Barack Obama's birth certificate is a fraud we still don't know who that extremely credible says I think it might be John Miller hey Katie Katie what's the history of this country over the last 40 years if people had stopped reading when Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein started using deep throat as a source hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or
