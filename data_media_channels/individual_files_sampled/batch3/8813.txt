Ask your rheumatologist about XELJANZ XR. THE FIRST LADY TOO ACCIDENT STEP TO THE FORFRONT FOR AN INITIATIVE. I WOULD LIKE TOTH KATE OUR CHILDREN ABOUT HARASSMENT AND BALANCED LIFE. THERE WAS SOME STRAIGHTFORWARD COVERAGE. SOME JOURNALIST PICKED UP ON A WASHINGTON POST REPORT SAYING THE FIRST LASTEDDY AND HUSBAND LEAD SEPARATE LIVES. THE WASHINGTON POST AMONGST MANY THINGS REPORTED THERE ARE RUMORS. MRS. TRUMP DOESN'T LIVE-IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND LIVES WITH HER PARENTS SOMEWHERE IN THE SUBURBS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE RUE RUMORS? I MAKE OF THE FACT THAT THE WASHINGTON POST CAN'T GET THINGS ANYMORE WRONG THEY DO. THAT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS CLAIM. I SPOKE EARLIER WITH A REPORTER FROM FOX NEWS 24/7 HEADLINES. THE RUMOR IS REPORTED IN THE 57th PARAGRAPH FOLLOWED BY OFFICIALS SAYING IT'S FALSE. WOULD YOU HAVE PUBLISHED THE RUMOR. NO, I WOULDN'T HAVE. TO THEIR CREDIT EVERY TIME THEY DID HAVE A CLAIM FROM AN UNNAMED SOURCE THEY DID BACK IT UP BY TALKING TO THE FIRST LADY'S SPOKE PERSON. STILL, THAT WAS PUBLISHED AND IT STICKS WITH PEOPLE. THE FACT THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS READING STAR MAGAZINE INSTEAD OF THE WASHINGTON POST IS A PROBLEM. I THINK THIS ARTICLE REALLY CROSSED THE LINE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THE MOST GLARING WAS WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT NEVER PHOTOGRAPHED WITH HIS SON BARON. IT FELT FORCED AT TIMES. I BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE WILL READ THIS ARTICLE AND TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND SAY PART OF IT IS TRUE AND PART OF IT ISN'T. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS IS NOT A TABLOID THIS IS THE WASHINGTON POST. IT'S FAIR TO CRITICIZE AN INITIATIVE. EVEN TO SAY HER CYBERBULLYING CAMPAIGN IS UNDERCUT BY HER HUSBAND'S ATTACKS ON TWITTER. DO YOU FIND SOME OF THIS IS DISMISSING OR MOCKING. I REALLY DO, IT ALL DOES USUALLY FOCUS AROUND THEIR MARRIAGE. THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY ARE INDEPENDENT PEOPLE. SHE'S NOT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WILL GO UP AND HUG SOMEONE IN PUBLIC. UH-HUH. WHEN SHE UNVEILED HER INITIATIVE SHE WAS AFFECTIONATE WITH THE PRESIDENT. MANY SAY THAT MOMENT WAS FORCED AND STAGED. THEY CAN'T WIN NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO. A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE STORMY DANIELS SITUATION AND THAT'S REAL. YOU SHOULD LEAVE THAT KIND OF STUFF TO CERTAIN PUBLICATIONS AND TWITTER NOT SERIOUS NEWS SOURCES. WE HAVE A HALF MINUTE. SOME SAY SHE WAS RIPPING OFF A BOOKLET FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. HER SPOKESWOMAN HIT THE OPPOSITION MEDIA PSIING IT'S ONE DOCUMENT. WE DIDN'T MAKE A SEC RIT THAT THIS HAD BEEN OUT THERE BEFORE. DOES THIS SUGGEST SHE CAN'T CATCH A BREAK. ALSO THE FACT THEY WERE CRITICIZING THE NAME OF THE INITIATIVE. SAYING SHE MAY HAVE COPIED MICHELLE OBAMA BECAUSE IN 2016 SHE SAID BE BETTER. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY COULD STAKE CLAIM ON BE BETTER.
