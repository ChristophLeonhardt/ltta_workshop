EVEN AFTER THE DEAL, IRAN CONTINUED TO PRESERVE AND EXPAND ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR FUTURE USE. WHY WOULD A TERRORIST REGIME HIDE AND PARTICULAR COLUMBUSLY CATALOG ITS SECRET NUCLEAR FILES IF NOT TO USE THEM AT A LATER DATE? BRIAN: IF YOU SAW THIS PRESENTATION THIS AFTERNOON, HAD YOU TO BE IMPRESSED, NOT ONLY THE WAY IT WAS DONE BUT WHAT HE SAID. JOINING US RIGHT NOW IS THE MAN BEHIND THAT PRESENTATION, WHO IS WORKING WITHOUT NOTES, THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU LIVE IN JERUSALEM. WELCOME MR. PRIME MINISTER, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AINSLEY: WELCOME, GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. GOOD TO TALK TO YOU. BRIAN: YESTERDAY, I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE ABLE TO GET THAT TREASURE TROVE, THANKS TO THE THAT THANKS TO THE MHAT THANKS TO THE MAST THANKS TO THE MASAD AND THEIR GREAT WORK IN JANUARY. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO PRESENT IT IN MAY? I WON'T SAY HOW WE GOT IT AND WHO GOT IT BUT ISRAEL OBTAINED THIS INFORMATION ACTUALLY IN FEBRUARY. IT'S 100,000-PLUS DOCUMENTS, HUGE TROVE, AS YOU SAY. IT'S IN FARCY. WE HAD TO PUT TRANSLATER ON IT PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THESE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL. SO IT TOOK US A WHILE TO DO IT. I MET THE PRESIDENT IN EARLY MARCH, PRESIDENT TRUMP. I DESCRIBED TO HIM WHAT WE HAVE. I SAID THAT WE'LL MOVE IMMEDIATELY ALL THIS INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES WHICH WE DID. SO WE HAVE BEEN EXAMINING IT SIMULTANEOUSLY. HERE IN ISRAEL AND HERE IN AMERICA. AND IT'S TAKEN US A WHILE, BUT I THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW. I PRESENTED WHAT WE KNOW AND IT'S PAD ENOUGH. IT REGIME, THE PREEMINENT TERRORIST REGIME OF OUR TIME IN WHICH IT'S GOONS CHANT DEATH TO AMERICA. DEATH TO ISRAEL. THIS ARE A JAIL TIME HAD A SECRET NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM AND THEY ARE TRYING UNDER A VERY BAD DEAL TO GET A NUCLEAR ARSENAL. THEY SHOULDN'T GET IT. AINSLEY: TELL THE FOLKS AT HOME, JUST TO BIGGIE BACK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, MULLAHS ARE SAYING DEATH TO AMERICA, DEATH TO ISRAEL. THEY HAVE KILLED AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN IRAQ. DESCRIBE A WORLD WHERE THESE RADICAL MULL ALSO RADICAL MULLAALSO RADICAL MULLAHSSO RADICAL MULLAHS.O AND HOW SERIOUS THIS WOULD BE FOR ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. WELL, AINSLEY, WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS WHAT IRAN IS DOING TODAY WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I MEAN, IT'S GOBBLE BLING UP ONE COUNTRY AFTER THE OTHER. IT'S THREATENING TO ANNIHILATE ISRAEL. THREATENING TO PUT ITS ARMY IN SYRIA IN THE SERVICE OF THE TYRANNICAL REGIME. IT'S PUTTING PRECISION GUIDED MOON ADMISSIONS IN LEBANON. THAT MEANS THEY CAN FIRE ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL THAT CAN HIT THE OFFICE I'M SPEAKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT TERRORISM IN GAZA. THEY ARE FIRING REACTS NOAHRY ADFROM YEMEN WHICH THEY ARE ALSO SEEKING TO CONQUER. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW. THEY HATE AMERICA'S GUTS. IF THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY GET AN ARSENAL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IF THIS DEAL GOES THROUGH AS IS. I'M VERY GLAD I HAVE TO TELL THAT YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS STOOD SO FIRMLY AND CLEARLY ON THIS ISSUE. HE SAID THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I PHILLY BACK AND I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY IN THE INTEREST OF ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES, THAT'S OBVIOUS. IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THE WORLD. THIS TYRANNICAL ANTI-AMERICAN REGIME SHOULD NOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. STEVE: THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS YOU MADE THAT GREAT DISPLAY AND PRESENTATION YESTERDAY ON TELEVISION, MR. PRIME MINISTER. YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO PULL OUT AND DATE CERTAIN IS MAY THE 12TH. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE FACT THAT MIKE POMPEO AND OUR INTEL PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THE COUNTRY OF IRAN IS IN COMPLIANCE RIGHT NOW WITH THE DEAL? IF YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE DEAL AND YOU COMPLY WITH A TERRIBLE DEAL. THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU AT ALL. THIS DEAL RIGHT NOW. ASSUMING IRAN JUST COMPLIES COML ASSUMING IRAN JUST COMPLIES COME ASSUMING IRAN JUST COMPLIES COMS WITH IT. THEY GOAL THE DISTANCE AND HAVE WITHIN A FEW YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY, THEY WILL HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO PRODUCE A HUNDRED NUCLEAR BOMBS. THAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY CONTINUING WITH THE DEAL AND I THINK CERTAINLY NOT CONTINUING WITH IT AS STRUCTURED. I THINK, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SAID. FULLY FIX OR FULLY KNICKS. FULLY FIX, YOU NEED A MAJOR OVERHAUL AND REALLY NEED A NEW DEAL. THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THE UNITED STATES IS ONE PERSON. THAT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND I TRUST HIS JUDGMENT. I KNOW THAT HE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND I SAID YESTERDAY HE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING FOR AMERICA. THE RIGHT THING FOR ISRAEL. AND THE RIGHT THING FOR THE SECURITY AND PEACE OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. BINE BRIAN MR. PRIME MINISTER, TELL ME IF THIS IS TRUE. THE PROGRAM SHOWS THAT THEY WANTED TO BUILD A BOMB BECAUSE THEN THAT SHOWS VAUGHN LYING. THEY ALWAYS HAVE SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BUILD A BOMB. IT WAS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN ANYONE THOUGHT. FUNDAMENTALLY WE GO INTO THIS DEAL THREE YEARS AGO PREMISE.
