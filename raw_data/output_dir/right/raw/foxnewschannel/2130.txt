00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,022
>> Laura: TIME NOW FOR OUR

2
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:16,259
"DEFENDING THE FIRST" WHERE WE

3
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:20,497
DEFEND THE AMENDMENT, AND FREE

4
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:21,164
THOUGHT.

5
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:22,799
YOU ALL KNOW BEN SHAPIRO, AND IF

6
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:24,801
YOU DON'T, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

7
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,035
HE'S BECOME ONE OF THE NATION'S

8
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:27,537
LEADING FIGURES IN THE EFFORTS

9
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:29,539
TO PRESERVE FREE SPEECH,

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:30,774
ESPECIALLY ON CAMPUS.

11
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:33,810
HE'S ALSO BEEN A FREQUENT TARGET

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,478
OF LEFTISTS FOR TRYING TO SHUT

13
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:36,913
DOWN HIS FREE SPEECH.

14
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:38,515
WHAT'S THE LATEST ATTEMPT?

15
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,717
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS.

16
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:43,720
THIS IS A CAMPAIGN TO BLAME BEN

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,321
SHAPIRO FOR INCITING A DEADLY

18
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:47,524
TERROR ATTACK ON A CANADIAN

19
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:48,024
MOSQUE LAST YEAR.

20
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:49,926
WE WELCOME BACK TO THE ANGLE,

21
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,362
BEN SHAPIRO.

22
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:54,931
THE EDITOR AND CHIEF OF THE

23
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:55,498
DAILY WIRE.

24
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:56,699
HE LOOKS SO UNASSUMING, AND WHAT

25
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,537
DO YOU WEIGH, LIKE 150 POUNDS?

26
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:04,441
>> 165, COME ON.

27
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:08,478
LAUGH     [LAUGHS]

28
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,513
>> Laura: WHAT YOU DON'T LOOK

29
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:11,481
LIKE ANYTHING.

30
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,316
EXPLAIN HOW YOU ARE ALLEGEDLY

31
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:14,117
INVOLVED IN INSPIRING THIS

32
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,186
HORRIBLE ATTACK ON A MOSQUE,

33
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:16,920
BECAUSE YOU MADE COMMENTS ABOUT

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,622
ISLAMIC TERROR IN THE PAST AND

35
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:22,292
IT WAS ALL STITCHED TOGETHER?

36
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,327
>> Ben: THERE WAS THIS EVIL

37
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,529
PIECE OF HUMAN THAT SHOT UP A

38
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,198
MOSQUE LAST YEAR AND HE HAPPENED

39
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:29,499
TO BE SOMEBODY THAT SAW SOME OF

40
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,501
MY TWEETS ON TWITTER.

41
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:34,103
HE HAD ALSO SEEN TWEETS FROM

42
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:35,839
PEOPLE, FROM YOU AND A BUNCH OF

43
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,073
DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT I GUESS MY

44
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:38,541
ACCOUNT WAS THE ONE HE HAD

45
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,509
VIEWED THE MOST.

46
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,111
NOW I HAVE 1.4 MILLION TWITTER

47
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:43,746
FOLLOWERS SO IF SOMEONE VIEWS

48
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,181
ENOUGH OF MY TWEETS, THEY ARE

49
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,583
INEVITABLY GOING TO BECOME A

50
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:47,116
TERRORIST.

51
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:49,385
WE ARE THAT I DON'T HAVE A SPACE

52
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:50,520

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,222
COUNTRY THANKS TO MY TWITTER

FOLLOWING, BUT NONE OF THIS IS

55
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,926
REAL.

56
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,896
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT DID NOT SAY

57
00:01:59,896 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS WAS BERNIE SANDERS' FAULT.
