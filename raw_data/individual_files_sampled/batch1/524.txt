we all are feeling threatened young we wanted a peaceful protest we don't want any trouble occurring around here yet rubber bullets were shot on our brothers at mirco neighborhood they were dispersed we don't want all this next individual killings the disappearances that need to get protection money at all levels bribery at all levels corruption and education it's a never ending list it's it's been huge so it really is that pent-up inner energy emotion anger that has been left loose the police specifically asked for help from these armed goons to combat unarmed students demanding safe roads I mean how ridiculous is that today I was in the street there are people with machetes in in their hands chasing unarmed students and the police are standing by watching it happen
