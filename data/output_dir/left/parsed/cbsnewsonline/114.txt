MEET WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN? 
BUT I THINK THAT YOU ASKED TWO 
QUESTIONS AND IT IS YES TO EACH 
OF THEM THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH 
THAT AND MEET WITH LESS-THAN-
PERFECT CITIZENS OF THE WORLD 
AND MOVE THE BALL IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION BUT I THINK IT WAS 
MORE THAN APPROPRIATE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT MEET WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
>> MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION IS 
THAT WE NEED TO DE-ESCALATE 
SOME OF THE PARTISAN TENSIONS 
IN OUR COUNTRY I LOOK TOWARDS 
WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE 
DISCUSSIONS WITH FOREIGN 
LEADERS AND NOT BE SO 
SIMPLISTIC THAT SOMEHOW THEY 
HAVE TO HAVE A PERFECT RECORD 
OR THAT WE HAVE TO SHOUT AND 
SCREAM. I THINK THAT BACK TO 
REAGAN TALKING TO GORBACHEV, HE 
SAID TEAR DOWN THE WALL AND 
CALL THEM AN EVIL EMPIRE. 
I DO NOT IMAGINE HIM SITTING 
DOWN AND YELLING AND SHAKING 
HIS FIST AND SAYING MURDERER 
AND A THUG AND RESTATE RECITING 
THE STALL IN'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSES BUT I THINK THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS 
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BETWEEN 
SITTING DOWN AND HOW DIPLOMACY 
WOULD OCCUR BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 
AND RECITING A LITANY OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS ABUSES.  
IN THAT VEIN, I THINK THAT 
THERE IS A -- THERE SEEMS TO BE 
A LIMITLESS APPETITE FOR MORE 
SANCTIONS. 
MAYBE INSUFFICIENT INTEREST IN 
DESCRIBING WHAT ACTIONS ARE 
NEEDED TO REMOVE SANCTIONS. 
SO SENATOR RUBIO MENTIONED THIS 
DETER ACT. 
I GUESS MY CONCERN WAS SOME OF 
THIS -- WITH SOME OF THIS IS 
THAT THE DEFINITION OF WHO 
MIGHT BE MEDDLING IN AN 
ELECTION IN OUR COUNTRY IS NOT 
LIMITED TO JUST RUSSIA. 
IT COULD INCLUDE ALLIES THAT 
SPEND MONEY ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN 
OUR COUNTRY BUT IT DOES NOT 
SEEM TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND ACTUALLY 
HACKING INTO OUR ELECTORAL 
SYSTEM AND CHANGING THOUSANDS 
OF VOTES. 
IT TAKES THE POWER AWAY FROM 
THE PRESIDENT AND GIVES IT TO 
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE. 
THIS IS THE DETER ACT WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
I KNOW THAT YOU INDICATED THAT 
SANCTIONS ARE A GOOD IDEA TO 
DETER THEM. 
TO THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO 
TAKE THE SANCTION POWER, GIVE 
IT TO THE DAY AND I AND THEN 
THE SANCTIONS HAVE TO REMAIN IN 
PLACE FOR 8 HOURS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT NOT HAVING ANY 
ABILITY TO DECIDE IF THERE HAS 
BEEN SOME KIND OF CHANGE IN 
BEHAVIOR BY THE MALEFACTORS? 
>> WITHOUT HAVING SEEN THE 
LEGISLATION, I DO NOT THINK 
THAT IS A GOOD IDEA. 
>> I LIKE YOUR STATEMENT WHERE 
YOU SAID, THE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
BELIEVES THAT NOW IS THE TIME 
FOR DIRECT COMMUNICATION IN OUR 
RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO MAKE 
CLEAR TO PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT 
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY TO 
REVERSE THE NEGATIVE COURSE OF 
OUR RELATIONSHIP I THINK BACK 
AT THE HEART OF WHY WE HAVE 
THESE DISCUSSIONS. 
IF YOU KEEP SANCTIONS ON A 
CONGRESS PUTS THEM ON AND THEY 
HAVE TO STAY ON FOR EIGHT YEARS 
AND NEVER COME UP, IF THERE IS 
NO OFF-RAMP, IF THERE IS NO 
DISCUSSION, THAT IS WHAT 
DIPLOMACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
ABOUT THE I COMMEND YOU FOR 
TALKING TO KIM JONG-UN. 
ARE WE HERE TO EXTOL HIS RECORD 
ON HUMAN RIGHTS? 
OBVIOUSLY NOT. 
AT THE SAME TIME FOR SANCTIONS 
TO HAVE AN EFFECT, YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE NEGOTIATION. 
I WOULD SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES 
THAT HAVE BEEN ALL OVER 
TELEVISION, SAYING THAT THERE 
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MEETING. 
THINK AGAIN JUST KEEPING THE 
SANCTIONS ON AND YOU DO NOT 
WANT TO THE AUTHORITY TO TALK 
TO THE ADVERSARY ABOUT HOW WE 
WOULD ACTUALLY REMOVE THE 
SANCTIONS BEHAVIOR CHANGES. 
YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE 
COMMUNICATIONS. 
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT WE 
HAVE AIRPLANES FLYING WITHIN A 
MILE OR WITHIN 100 YARDS OF 
EACH OTHER IN SYRIA. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE OPEN LINES OF 
COMMUNICATION. 
WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT WE TRY 
TO DE-ESCALATE THE PARTISANSHIP 
IN OUR COUNTRY SO THAT WE CAN, 
ONCE AGAIN, BE OPEN TO SOME 
KIND OF DIPLOMACY. 
I HAVE ONE QUESTION WITH REGARD 
TO IRAN AND YOU AND I DIFFER ON 
THE IRANIAN POSSIBILITY OF 
FURTHER IRANIAN AGREEMENT. 
I THINK THAT IS ACTUALLY MUCH 
MORE DIFFICULT I HAD MY OWN 
CRITICISMS OF THE NUCLEAR 
AGREEMENT. 
I DID NOT THINK IT WAS PERFECT 
AND YET I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO 
HAVE BUILT UPON IT RATHER THAN 
DESTROY IT. 
WE HAD A LOT OF MONEY AT THE 
TIME AND THAT WAS A CARROT TO 
BRING IRAN TO THE TABLE. 
NOW WE HAVE INSTEAD OF ONE 
ISSUE, INSTEAD OF A SMALLER 
GROUP OF ISSUES, WE HAVE A 
BIGGER GROUP OF ISSUES. 
THE NUCLEAR ISSUES ARE BACK ON 
THE TABLE IF WE HAVE TO 
RENEGOTIATE AND THE BALLISTIC 
MISSILE ISSUE. 
THE POINT THAT I THINK THAT WE 
NEED TO THINK THROUGH IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH IRAN IS THAT I 
THINK THAT IRAN, FROM THEIR 
PERSPECTIVE WOULD SEE GETTING 
RID OF THEIR BALLISTIC MISSILE 
PROGRAM IS BASICALLY UNILATERAL 
OR SURRENDER. 
IT IS NOT MY VIEWPOINT. 
IT IS WHAT I BELIEVE IS THERE 
VIEWPOINT. 
THEY SEE SAUDI ARABIA AS AN 
ADVERSARY AND ISRAEL AS A 
POTENTIAL ADVERSARY SO I DO NOT 
THINK UNLESS -- IT WOULD BE 
GREAT IF YOU GOT ALL THREE TO 
COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON NOT 
DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
I DO NOT TO THE OTHER TWO 
COMING TO THE TABLE, FRANKLY, 
TO DO THAT. 
I THINK THAT IN MOVING FORWARD, 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT 
GOING TO BE EASY. 
THE FIRT IRAN AGREEMENT ALSO 
WAS A MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT. 
YOU HAD MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS. 
YOU NOW HAVE MORE UNILATERAL 
SANCTIONS. 
YOU WILL HAVE A UNILATERAL 
AGREEMENT THAT IS YOUR OWN 
AGREEMENT. 
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE 
SO OPTIMISTIC BUT I WOULD LIKE 
TO HEAR FROM YOU. 
HOW DO YOU -- WHAT MAKES YOU 
BELIEVE THAT IRAN WILL COME TO 
THE TABLE TO DISCUSS BALLISTIC 
MISSILES? 
>> CENTER, I AM UNDER NO 
ILLUSIONS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT I 
RAN IT VIEWS ITS BALLISTIC 
MISSILE PROGRAM. 
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE. 
THE QUESTION FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS WAS AT THIS GOOD 
ENOUGH? 
HE CONCLUDED IT WAS NOT 
REMOTELY GOOD ENOUGH. 
HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST 
DEALS IN HISTORY. 
I DO NOT WANT TO GET THE 
LANGUAGE WRONG. 
HE CONCLUDED WE WOULD FIND 
OURSELVES IN A BETTER PLACE 
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT 
ALL OF THESE ISSUES, THE BROAD 
SPECTRUM OF ISSUES AND NOT JUST 
THE NUCLEAR PORTFOLIO BUT THE 
MISSILE PROGRAM AND MALIGN 
ACTIVITY AROUND THE WORLD. 
ALL OF THEM IN A PACKAGE. 
IT DID ACCEPT THE UNDERSTANDING 
THAT THERE WOULD BE THOSE THAT 
WOULD NOT COME ALONGSIDE OF US, 
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT 
THERE'S A COALITION. 
IT IS NOT AMERICA AND AMERICA 
ALONE. 
WE HAVE OTHERS THAT BELIEVE 
THAT THIS WAS THE RIGHT 
DECISION. 
THE ISRAELIS, SAUDIS, AND 
VARIETIES, BAHRAINIS AND OTHER 
SMALLER EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS. 
NOT -- THEY ARE COALESCING 
AROUND UNDERSTANDING HOW WE CAN 
APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO IRAN 
TO TAKE DOWN THE NUCLEAR ARREST 
TO THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS 
THE RISK FROM OTHER MALIGN 
ACTIVITIES. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
THANK YOU, SECRETARY MIKE 
POMPEO, FOR YOUR SERVICE. 
WE HAVE QUITE THE RECORD OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUSINESS 
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 
EXTENSIVE REPORTING AND PUBLIC 
RECORDS SHOW A LARGE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY FROM FORMER SOVIET STATES 
AND RUSSIA IN THE DONALD TRUMP 
PROJECTS. 
TRUMP INTERNATIONAL TOWER AND 
HOTEL IN TORONTO, THE TRUMP 
HOTEL IN PANAMA. 
THE TRUMP PROJECT IN SOHO AND 
NEW YORK CITY ARE A FEW OF THE 
BIG EXAMPLES. 
HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. 
A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH BOUGHT A 
PROPERTY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 
FOR -- CANDIDATE TRUMP AT THE 
TIME OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT 
BEFORE, FOR $95 MILLION IN 
2008. 
THAT WAS LESS THAN FOUR YEARS 
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP PAID $41 
MILLION, SO MORE THAN DOUBLING 
HIS MONEY. 
DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR IN 2008 
STATED THAT A REAL ESTATE 
CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK AND I 
QUOTE HERE, RUSSIANS MAKE UP A 
PRETTY DISPROPORTIONATE CROSS-
SECTION OF A LOT OF OUR ASSETS 
END QUOTE. 
DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO BUILD A 
TRUMP TOWER IN MOSCOW FOR 30 
YEARS. 
HE EVEN TWEETED IN 2013, TRUMP 
TOWER MOSCOW IS NEXT. 
THAT IS IN QUOTES. 
IN 2015, ANSWERING A QUESTION 
FROM THE INDICTED RUSSIAN 
OPERATIVE AND ALLEGED SPY, 
MARIA BUTINA, CANDIDATE TRUMP 
MADE CLEAR HIS DESIRES WITH 
RUSSIA, STATING I WOULD GET 
ALONG WELL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN 
AND I DO NOT THINK THAT WE NEED 
THE SANCTIONS. 
NOW THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO 
THE UNITED STATES AND SAID THAT 
THE PRESIDENT MAY, AND THIS IS 
HIS QUOTE, IMPORTANT VERBAL 
AGREEMENTS WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN. 
HE SEEMS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT 
HELSINKI AND WHAT HAPPENED 
THERE THAN THE SENATE FOREIGN 
RELATIONS COMMITTEE. 
AS WE SAW IN HELSINKI AND 
THROUGHOUT HIS PRESIDENCY IN 
THE CAMPAIGN, THIS PRESIDENT IS 
XTREMELY SYMPATHETIC TO THE 
VERY RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT THAT 
ATTACKED AND CONTINUES TO 
ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY AND THOSE 
OF OUR ALLIES. 
IT IS A FACT OF POLITICAL LIFE 
TODAY THAT MANY AMERICANS ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
UNTHINKABLE, THAT A U.S. 
PRESIDENT COULD HAVE A 
COMPROMISED -- A COMPROMISING 
RELATIONSHIP WITH A FOREIGN 
POWER. 
PRESIDENT CAN CLEAR THIS ALL UP 
IN THREE SIMPLE WAYS. 
RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS AND 
THOSE OF THE DONALD TRUMP 
ORGANIZATION AND THE TAXES FROM 
THE VARIOUS FAMILY BUSINESSES, 
SOME OF WHICH WE DO NOT EVEN 
KNOW ABOUT. 
AFTER HELSINKI, DO YOU THINK 
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT IS IN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS 
AND BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT ARE 
INTERTWINED WITH RUSSIA? 
>> SENATOR, I'M GOING TO TRY TO 
STAY OUT OF THE SAME POLITICAL 
CIRCUS THAT YOU AND I ENDED UP 
IN LAST TIME THAT I WAS SITTING 
HERE. 
SIMPLY RESPONDING BY SAYING, 
THIS IS SAME PRESIDENT WITH 
WHICH YOU SEEM TO EXPRESS SUCH 
A DEEP CONCERN IS ENGAGED IN A 
MASSIVE DEFENSE BUILDUP WHICH 
THREATENED VLADIMIR PUTIN'S 
REGIME.  
HE INSTRUCTED US TO PUT 
TOGETHER A NUCLEAR POSTURE 
REVIEW THAT HAS SET VLADIMIR 
PUTIN ON HIS EAR BECAUSE OF THE 
ROBUSTNESS AND THE 
RECAPITALIZATION OF THE NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM. 
HE HAS KICKED OUT 60 SPIES AND 
PUT $11 MILLION INTO THE -- 
>> YOU HAVE ALREADY -- SPLIT I 
HAVE NOT EVEN BEGUN TO 
DESCRIBE. 
>> YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY 
QUESTION. 
LET ME TRY IT A LITTLE 
DIFFERENT WAY. 
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW, AS 
SECRETARY OF STATE --  I MEAN, 
I AM TAKING YOU IN YOUR 
SINCERITY HERE. 
AS SECRETARY OF STATE, WHETHER 
ALL OF THESE RUSSIAN FINANCIAL 
INTERESTS OLIGARCHS AND OTHERS  
ARE PART OF THE DECISION-MAKING 
OF THE PRESIDENT. 
I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU WANT THAT 
OUT IN THE OPEN AND TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT ON? 
IT IS HELSINKI. 
IT IS AN EASY YES OR NO 
QUESTION. 
>> I DO NOT NEED SECONDHAND 
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS INSTRUCTING HIS 
ADMINISTRATION TO DO TO PUSH 
BACK AGAINST RUSSIA BUT I HAVE 
FIRST-HAND UNDERSTANDING AND 
DIRECTIVE. 
>> LET ME ASK THE QUESTION 
DIFFERENTLY. 
>> WE HAVE OPPOSED AND WE HAVE 
A 40 OUT OF 30 OUT OF NATO THAT 
IS A BIG SETBACK FOR RUSSIA. 
I AM HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE 
LIST. 
I AM HAPPY TO -- I WILL SUBMIT 
IT THE ENTIRETY OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION'S ACTIONS 
AGAINST RUSSIA FOR THE RECORD 
IF I MIGHT. 
>> PLEASE DO. 
>>> PULL A TRUCK UP AND GET IT 
IN HERE. 
>> CANDIDATE TRUMP HAS FAILED 
TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO DISCLOSE 
HIS TAX RETURNS FOR EVERY 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SINCE 
RICHARD NIXON HAS DISCLOSED. 
JIMMY CARTER EVEN SOLD HIS 
PEANUT FARM TO AVOID A CONFLICT 
OF INTEREST. 
THE SITUATION WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S POTENTIAL FOREIGN-
POLICY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS 
UNPRECEDENTED AND UNACCEPTABLE. 
AND UNDER THE EMOLUMENTS 
CLAUSE, I THINK IT IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS WELL. 
BUT LET ME JUST ASK A COUPLE OF 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HELSINKI. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE 
TASKED WITH. 
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE STATED THAT AT THE 
ASPEN SECURITY FORM THAT HE DID 
NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED DURING 
THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING IN 
HELSINKI. 
DID THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY 
DEBRIEF YOU ON THIS 
CONVERSATION. 
ARE YOU 100% CONFIDENT THAT YOU 
KNOW EVERYTHING THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DISCUSSED WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN? 
THAT IS A VERY EASY YES OR NO 
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ANSWER, I 
WILL MOVE ON. 
YES OR NO. 
>>> I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT I 
RECEIVED A -- A DEBRIEFING FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> GOOD. 
YOU KNOW FOR FACT IF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP OR PRESIDENT PUTIN AND 
DISCUSSED ANY INVESTMENTS IN 
TRUMP PROPERTIES OR PROJECTS 
SUCH AS THE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO 
BUILD A DONALD TRUMP REAL 
ESTATE PROJECT IN MOSCOW? 
>> SENATOR, AGAIN, I'M GOING TO 
STAY OUT OF THE POLITICAL 
CIRCUS. 
>> WERE YOU TEST WITH THAT? 
YOU GAVE US A LIST. 
>> WE CAME HERE TO TALK ABOUT 
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY. 
I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ARTICULATE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> ALL OF THE INTERESTS ARE 
IMPLYING, SIR, WITH HER FOREIGN-
POLICY. 
>> FOREIGN POLICY HAS LED TO A 
MASSIVE DEFENSE BUILDUP. 
A NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW THAT 
HAS FRIGHTENED VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
60 SPIES. 
219 -- 213 SANCTIONS. 
>> LET ME ALSO ASK YOU ABOUT AN 
ADDITIONAL QUESTION ON 
HELSINKI. 
>> WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS, I TRIED DESPERATELY 
TO GET PRESIDENT OBAMA TO DO 
ONE OF THOSE THINGS. 
>>> WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP HOSTED 
TOP RUSSIAN OFFICIALS AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE LAST YEAR HE 
BRAGGED ABOUT HOW HE FIRE JAMES 
COMEY AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE 
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
HE CALLED A SPECIAL COUNSELOR 
ROBERT MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION 
A DISASTER FOR THE COUNTRY. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DISCUSSED ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATION DURING HIS 
PRIVATE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
THAT. 
>>> WERE YOU TEST WITH ANYTHING 
IN THAT RESPECT? 
MECH SENATOR, WHEN I AM TEST 
ABOUT SOMETHING FOR FOR -- 
>> YOU WERE NOT TEST WITH 
ANYTHING THERE? 
>> WHEN I'M TEST WITH SOMETHING 
BY THE PRESIDENT THAT RELATES 
TO FOREIGN-POLICY, I ASSURE YOU 
THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL BE MADE 
AWARE OF IT. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
SENATOR GARDNER. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
SECRETARY FOR YOUR SERVICE TO 
THE COUNTRY AND YOUR TIME WITH 
US TODAY. 
WHEN YOU WERE HERE LAST I ASKED 
YOU A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR 
NOT YOU AGREE WITH SECRETARY 
MATTIS THAT NORTH KOREA IS THE 
MOST URGENT SECURITY THREAT 
THAT THE UNITED STATES FACES 
AND IN LIGHT OF RECENT 
AGREEMENTS DO YOU AGREE WITH 
THAT?  
AT THE TIME YOU SAID YOU DID. 
>> IT IS A PRIORITY. 
>> WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT -- YOU 
BELIEVE IS THE MOST URGENT 
NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT? 
>> I DO. 
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, I DO NOT 
RECALL THE PRECISE TIMING WHEN 
I WAS HERE. 
I THINK IT WAS IN APRIL. 
SO IT IS -- THE FACT THAT WE 
ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND WE 
HAVE NOT HAD ADDITIONAL MISSILE 
TESTS AND NUCLEAR TESTING -- 
MAYBE IT IS STILL A PRIORITY 
BUT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO THINK 
ABOUT IT, BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC 
THAT WE ARE GOING IN A PATH 
THAT IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND 
WE HAVE GOT TO GET THE RATE OF 
CHANGE. 
>>> THE TESTIMONY, USED THE 
TERM FINAL AND FULLY VERIFIED 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND IN 
PREVIOUS TESTIMONY USED 
PERMANENT AND U.S. LAWS IS 
COMPLETE AND VERIFIABLE 
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION 
AND RESOLUTIONS CALLED FOR THE 
COMPLETE AND VERIFIABLE 
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION. 
DO THEY MEAN THE SAME THING? 
>> PRECISELY THE SAME THING. 
>> ACCORDING TO U.S. LAW AND 
U.S. SECURITY RESOLUTIONS. 
WHY THE DIFFERENT WORDS? 
>> SOMETIMES ONE NEEDS TO JUST 
BREAK AWAY. 
>>>  BUT I'M HAPPY 
TO USE THE TERM VERIFIABLE 
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THEY MEAN THE SAME THING. 
>> OKAY. 
THE DECLARATION OR 
DETERMINATION, WAS THAT 
DIRECTLY ADDRESSED AT THE 
SINGAPORE SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND THE CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-
UN? 
>> IT WAS. 
>> IT WAS BROUGHT UP THAT THOSE 
ARE THE -- WHY WAS IT NOT IN 
THE COMMUNICATION? 
FOLLOWING THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT? 
MECH I WOULD RATHER NOT TALK 
ABOUT THE COURSE OF THE 
NEGOTIATIONS AND HOW WE ARRIVED 
AT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE DID. 
>>> IS NORTH KOREA STILL MAKING 
ADVANCEMENTS UNDERTAKING 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM? 
>> MAY I ANSWER THAT QUESTION 
IN A DIFFERENT SETTING? 
>> YOU CANNOT ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION HERE? 
MECH YEAH. 
I WOULD PREFER NOT TO. 
>> WE WOULD LOVE TO PROVIDE 
THAT SETTING FOR YOU SOON HAPPY 
TO DO IT IF WE NEED TO. 
I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. 
SENATOR, I AM NOT TRYING TO BE 
CUTE. 
WE ARE ENGAGED IN A COMPLEX 
NEGOTIATION WITH A DIFFICULT 
ADVERSARY, AND EACH OF THE 
ACTIVITIES THAT WE UNDERTAKE IS 
NOT GOING TO BE FULLY APPARENT 
TO THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT THAT 
IS UNDERTAKEN. 
THERE WILL BE PROCESSES AND 
DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL BE HAD 
THAT IMPORTANT THAT THEY NOT BE 
REAL-TIME DISCLOSED. 
AS I ANSWER ONE QUESTION AND 
THEN CHOOSE NOT TO ANSWER 
ANOTHER, IT BECOMES PATENTLY 
OBVIOUS WHY I CHOSE NOT TO 
ANSWER ONE OR THE OTHER. 
THEREFORE, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT 
A BLANKET BAN ON GOING DOWN 
THAT PATH  IS THE ONLY WAY TO 
ENSURE THAT I HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE THIS 
THING IN A WAY THAT IS NOT 
BEING DONE IN THE WASHINGTON 
POST AND NEW YORK TIMES. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT. 
I THINK IT IS A VERY PORT -- 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT WE 
GET TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT, 
NORTH KOREA IS OVERTLY, 
COVERTLY, HOWEVER THEY ARE 
DOING IT, MAKING ADVANCEMENTS 
IN THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM OR STILL 
CONTINUING  THE MEASURE OF 
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 
I FORGET IT'S IMPORTANT. 
>> I ANSWERED A QUESTION THAT 
TOUCHES ON THAT. 
I ANSWER THE QUESTION FROM 
SENATOR MARQUIS ABOUT WHETHER 
THEY ARE CONTINUING  TO CREATE 
MATERIAL AND I ANSWERED THAT, 
INDEED, THEY ARE. 
>> THE GOAL ORIGINALLY, I THINK 
WAS COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION 
BY THE END OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
FIRST TERM. 
DOES THAT REMAIN THE GOAL? 
>> YES. 
>> MORE QUICKLY POSSIBLE. 
>> WHEN WILL WE KNOW IF NORTH 
KOREA IS MOVING TOWARDS 
DENUCLEARIZATION? 
CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE STEPS? 
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO 
THAT. 
I COULD NOT TELL YOU WHAT DAY 
AND I'M GUESSING THAT THIS 
GROUP WOULD DISAGREE ABOUT WHEN 
THAT MOMENT TOOK PLACE. 
THAT IS A PROCESS FOR SURE. 
SOME WILL FIND THAT THE FIRST 
STEP ALONG THE WAY 
DEMONSTRATION OF I THINK YOU 
SAID SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS BUT 
OTHERS MAY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL 
WE ARE ALMOST DONE TO DECLARE 
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS BUT I 
CANNOT ANSWER THAT. 
IT IS DEFINITELY A PROCESS. 
WE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE TIME. 
>>> WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON 
STRATEGIC PATIENTS. 
THE STATEMENT THAT YOU USED 
USES PATIENT DIPLOMACY. 
AS THE U.S. DOCTRINE TOWARDS 
NORTH KOREA STILL ONE OF 
MAXIMUM PRESSURE? 
>> IT IS. 
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE 
DIFFERENCE IS A LITTLE BIT 
SUBTLE AND PERHAPS I DO NOT 
WANT TO OVERSTATE THE 
DIFFERENCE IN THE LANGUAGE BUT 
HERE IS WHAT IS DEFENSE. 
STRATEGIC OPERATIONS IN OUR 
JUDGMENT WAS HOPING THAT 
SOMETHING WORKED RIGHT. 
HERE WE HAVE A STRATEGIC 
OBJECTIVE. 
BACKED UP WITH A DIPLOMATIC AND 
ECONOMIC PRESSURE WHICH WE 
BELIEVE GIVES US A PATHWAY TO 
ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE AND ALSO 
AN OFF-RAMP IN THE EVENT THAT 
WE CONCLUDE THAT IT DOES NOT 
WORK TO GO ANOTHER DIRECTION, 
TO ACHIEVE THE DEMILITARIZATION 
OF NORTH KOREA. 
>>> MAXIMUM PRESSURE USES THE 
SANCTIONS POLICY ENHANCEMENT 
ACT WHICH REQUIRES THE 
PRESIDENT TO INITIATE 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO POSSIBLE 
DESIGNATIONS, INVESTIGATIONS 
INTO THE PERSONS UPON EVIDENCE 
THAT THEY ARE VIOLATING 
PROLIFERATING ACTIVITIES SO 
THAT WE CAN APPLY ADDITIONAL 
SANCTIONS. 
COMMON INVESTIGATIONS INTO NEW 
DESIGNATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 
RIGHT NOW? 
>> I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUT 
LET ME TRY TO ANSWER YOUR 
QUESTION IN ANOTHER WAY AND SEE 
IF THIS MEETS IT. 
THIS IS THE CASE THAT THE 
MINISTRATION IS CONTINUING TO 
WORK ON ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR 
EXISTING SANCTIONS FOR THE 
EXISTING SANCTIONS REGIME. 
THAT IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET 
IT WANDER OFF AND GET WEAKER. 
YOU CANNOT RENAME A SHIP AND 
GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE 
SANCTIONS REGIME. 
THERE ARE ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT 
WORK BEING DONE AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT 
OF TREASURY RELATED TO NORTH 
KOREA. 
>> IT IS YOUR VIEW THAT THERE 
ARE ADDITIONAL NORTH KOREAN AND 
CHINESE ENTITIES THAT COULD BE 
IDENTIFIED FOR ADDITIONAL 
SANCTIONS. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> THEY ARE NOT BEING UPHELD OR 
LAID OFF? 
THEY WILL CONTINUE? 
>> WE'RE GOING TO USE THEM IN A 
WAY THAT WE THINK INCREASES THE 
LIKELIHOOD THAT KIM JONG-UN 
FULFILLS THE COMMITMENT. 
>>> WHY HAVE WE NOT SEEN 
DESIGNATIONS RECENTLY? 
>> I CANNOT ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO GET AN 
ANSWER FOR THAT IF WE COULD. 
HAS SOUTH KOREA MADE ADDITIONAL 
REQUESTS TO THE UNITED STATES 
FOR SANCTIONS RELIEF? 
>> AS IT RELATES TO ADDITIONAL 
ACTIVITIES WITH NORTH KOREA. 
>>> SO I THINK THAT THE REQUEST 
THAT SOUTH KOREA HAS MADE OUR 
PUBLIC, AND THEY HAVE OCCURRED 
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE UP AT THE 
UNITED NATIONS. 
SO I THINK THAT THE LIST OF 
THINGS THAT THE SOUTH KOREANS 
ARE REQUESTING IN TERMS OF 
EITHER MAKING SURE THAT THE 
ACTIVITY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 
SANCTIONS REGIME. THERE ARE 
HUMANITARIAN EXCEPTIONS. 
>> IS THE U.S. CONSIDERING OR 
GRANTING THOSE? 
>> WE ARE REVIEWING THE 
REQUEST. 
WE APPROVED ONE. 
>> SOUTH KOREA. 
>>> I'M SORRY. 
SOUTH KOREA. 
YES. 
WE HAD ONE THAT HAD TO DEAL 
WITH A MILITARY TO MILITARY 
COMMUNICATION CHANNEL AND THE 
OTHERS ARE UNDER REVIEW. 
>> IF WE COULD GET AN 
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SOME OF 
THOSE MEASURES ARE, THAT WOULD 
BE GREAT. 
YOU GAVE A VERY GOOD SPEECH ON 
JULY 22, ON THE IRAN POLICY, 
THE REAGAN LIBRARY, AS YOU 
MENTIONED. 
IF YOU WERE TO SUBSTITUTE THE 
WORD OUT, I RAN OUT AND 
SUBSTITUTE NORTH KOREA, WITH 
THE SPEECH ACCURATELY DESCRIBE 
THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN NORTH 
KOREA? 
>> THAT WAS A LONG SPEECH, 
SENATOR. 
>> BASICALLY THEY -- 
>> I THINK THAT IN LARGE PART, 
IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT.  
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. 
IN TERMS OF THEIR OPERATIONAL 
CAPACITY FOR THE NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM. 
BUT THE NATURE OF THE TWO 
REGIMES IS SIMILAR. 
>>> I AM OUT OF TIME, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> BEFORE TURNING IT OVER, I 
WILL USE A LITTLE BIT OF MY 
TIME. 
YOU OBVIOUSLY ACQUIT YOURSELF 
VERY WELL. 
THOSE OF US THAT KNOW YOU AND 
WORK WITH YOU HAVE MOSTLY -- 
MANY OF US, INCLUDING ME, AND I 
WILL SAY MOST OF US, ACTUALLY --
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS FAITH IN 
YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE THINGS 
HAPPEN, AND WE THANK YOU FOR 
ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARE 
TAKING ON, BUILDING A GREAT 
CULTURE IN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT, BRING ON PEOPLE 
THAT ARE TRULY EXEMPLARY. 
WE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT 
SECRETARY MATTIS. 
THE WAY THAT HE CONDUCTS 
HIMSELF AND WHAT HE DOES BUT I 
THINK THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS 
FAITH ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 
AISLE AND HIS ABILITIES AND 
WHAT HE DOES. 
MUCH OF WHAT YOU ARE HEARING 
TODAY HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO 
DO WITH YOU. 
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE 
POLICIES THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN 
PLACE AND IN MANY CASES, ARE 
STRONGER THAN THEY HAVE EVER 
BEEN PUT IN PLACE. 
I AGREE WITH YOU. 
IT IS THE PRESIDENT THAT CAUSES 
PEOPLE TO HAVE CONCERNS. 
AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME 
INSIGHTS INTO YOU AS TO -- FOR 
INSTANCE, AT THE HELSINKI 
CONFERENCE, THE EQUIVALENCE 
BETWEEN OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
AND WHAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS 
SAYING, THAT SHOCKS PEOPLE. 
YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU SAW DAN 
COATS RESPONDED AFTERWARDS AND 
TODAY, THIS WAS RELATED TO WHAT 
HE SAID AT HELSINKI. 
THE NOTION OF EVEN THINKING 
ABOUT EXCHANGING DIPLOMATS? 
SENDING DIPLOMATS OVER TO THE 
INTENT -- TO BE INTERROGATED BY 
VLADIMIR PUTIN? 
TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND TO LET 
THAT BE SET OUT OF THE WHITE 
HOUSE AS AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT? 
THIS IS MY OPINION AND I 
BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT, TO 
PURPOSELY CAUSE THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO MISUNDERSTAND ABOUT 
THE NATO CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO 
CAUSE THEM TO DOUBT NATO AND TO 
REALLY DRIVE PUBLIC OPINION 
AGAINST THE NATO -- THAT, TO 
ME, WAS PURPOSEFUL, NOT UNLIKE 
WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER 
CHARLOTTESVILLE. 
AND THEN ARTICLE 5. TO GO ON 
TELEVISION AND SAY, WELL, WHY 
WOULD WE HONOR THEY -- I AM 
PARAPHRASING, BUT WHY WOULD WE 
HONOR ARTICLE 5 AND MONTENEGRO? 
WE PASSED A LAW TO SEND THEM 
INTO NATO.  
HE SIGNED IT. 
IT WOULD BE A DERELICTION IF HE 
CAUSED IT TO BE THE CASE. 
WHY DOES HE DO THE CASE. 
IS THERE SOME STRATEGY ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE AISLE? 
DOUBT IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS 
TO WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS ARE, 
WHEN, IN FACT, WE HAVE 
TREMENDOUS FAITH IN YOU. 
TREMENDOUS FAITH IN MATTIS. 
BUT IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
ACTIONS THAT CREATE CEMENT -- 
TREMENDOUS DISTRUST IN OUR 
NATION, AMONG OUR ALLIES. 
IT IS PALPABLE. 
WE MEET AND TALK WITH THEM. 
IS THERE A STRATEGY TO THIS? 
WHAT IS IT THAT CAUSES THE 
PRESIDENT TO PURPOSELY CREATE 
DISTRUST IN THESE INSTITUTIONS? 
WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
>> SENATOR, I DISAGREE WITH 
MOST OF WHAT YOU SAID. 
YOU SOMEHOW DISCONNECT THE 
ADMINISTRATIONS ACTIVITIES FROM 
THE ACTIONS. 
THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME. 
EVERY SANCTION THAT WAS PUT IN 
PLACE WAS SIGNED OFF BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES, EVERY SPY 
REMOVED.
>> HE'S HAPPY TO MAKE CHANGES 
AND CHANGED THE COURSE. 
YOU WILL BE THERE AND HE WILL 
BE THEIR TOUGHEST ENEMY. I 
THINK I CAN PROVE THAT IS THE 
CASE. 
I THINK I HAVE. 
SOMEHOW THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT 
THE ADMINISTRATION IS FREELY 
FLOATING. 
IT'S PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
ADMINISTRATION AND MAKE NO 
MISTAKE WHO IS FULLY IN CHARGE 
OF THIS AND DIRECTING EACH 
ACIVITY THAT CAUSED RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADAMIR PUTIN TO BE 
IN A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE, 
TODAY. 
>> YOU'VE HANDLED OURSELVES THE 
WAY YOU SHOULD, IN MY OPINION, 
AS IT RELATES TO COMMENTS. 
I NOTICED THAT YOU ARE NOT 
RESPONDING TO WHAT I'M SAYING. 
>> I THINK I RESPONDED TO 
EVERYTHING, SENATOR. 
>> YOU DIDN'T. 
YOU JUST DIDN'T, OKAY? 
>> WE DISAGREE. 
>> IT'S IN THE TRANSCRIPT IF 
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. 
>> WE WILL LET THE WORLD 
DECIDE. 
>> IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS THAT CREATE CONCERN 
AMONG SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES OF 
THE AISLE. 
I WAS ASKING YOU IF, IN FACT, 
THERE WAS SOME RHYME OR REASON 
THAT THIS TYPE OF DISCORD WOULD 
BE CREATED. I KNOW YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. 
>> I KNOW YOU ARE. 
>> WHY THE OPEN COMMENTS ON THE 
QUESTIONS AND THE ENERGY BEHIND 
HIS HEARING, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU 
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT GENERAL 
MATTERS AND WHAT WE ARE DOING 
ON THE GROUND. 
>> SENATOR, YOU WENT THROUGH A 
LITANY OF STATEMENTS BUT, FIRST 
OF ALL, I WILL TELL YOU THAT 
I'VE TALKED TO THE SAME ALLIES 
YOU DO AND I'VE SPOKEN TO THE 
FOREIGN MINISTERS. 
IT IS THE CASE THEY ARE 
BEHAVING DIFFERENTLY. 
THEY ARE NOW SCRAMBLING TO 
FIGURE OUT HOW THEY ARE FULLY 
PART OF NATO AND SOME OF THAT 
IS A RESULT OF THE STATEMENTS 
YOU'VE REFERRED TO, SENATOR. 
SOME OF THAT IS IDENTIFYING THE 
NORTH --
>> I'VE SAID THAT. 
>> THERE YOU GO. 
I WILL LET THE RECORD REFLECT 
IT. 
>> SOME OF THESE STATEMENTS 
ACTUALLY ACHIEVED IMPORTANT 
POLICY OUTCOMES FOR THE U.S. 
>> SOME OF THEM WERE VERY 
DAMAGING. 
>> THANK YOU MR. SECRETARY. 
IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR 
BARRASSO'S QUESTION ON NEW 
START, I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP. 
THE U.S. AND RUSSIA CAME INTO 
COMPLIANCE IN FEBRUARY 2018 AND 
MET THE DEADLINE ON DEPLOYED 
NUCLEAR WARHEADS. 
MY IMPRESSION, FROM YOUR 
DIALOGUE, WAS THE U.S. DOES NOT 
YET HAVE A POSITION ON WEATHER 
TO WORK TO EXTEND THE NEW START 
AGREEMENT PAST 2021. 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN 
ACHIEVE THIS. 
WE VIEW THESE AS INDIVIDUAL 
AGREEMENTS, AS A LEGAL MATTER 
AND THEY CAN BE WORKED ON 
INDEPENDENTLY BUT THE DETERRENT 
MODEL, THE UNDERPINNING IN THE 
FRAMEWORK OF THESE AGREEMENTS 
THAT ARE CONNECTED, WHETHER IT 
BE COVERED BY NEW START OR THE 
INF TREATY OR OTHER PRECISION 
-- PROVISIONS, IT IS THE CASE 
THAT AS WE EVALUATE THIS 
APPROACH, WE TRY TO DO IT IN A 
HOLISTIC WAY. 
>> I CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THIS 
IS SOMETHING YOU AND YOUR TEAM 
WILL BE WORKING ON IN THE YEAR 
AHEAD, SETTING THE GROUNDWORK 
FOR THE OPTIONS. 
THANK YOU. 
RUSSIAN OIL TANKERS REPORTEDLY 
SUPPLIED FUEL TO NORTH KOREA 
SEVERAL TIMES IN 2017. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP MADE A 
REFERENCE IN WHICH HE TALKED 
ABOUT SAYING THAT WHAT CHINA IS 
HELPING US WITH, RUSSIA IS 
DENTING AND HE SAID, 
SPECIFICALLY, RUSSIA IS NOT 
HELPING US AT ALL WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
DID THIS ISSUE OF RUSSIA 
BYPASSING THE U.N. SANCTIONS 
COME UP IN THE CONVERSATION 
BETWEEN RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
VLADAMIR PUTIN AND PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP? 
>> I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT. 
I BELIEVE PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS. 
IN FACT, RUSSIA'S COMMITMENT TO 
HELP US ACHIEVE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 
DID COME UP IN THEY DISCUSSED 
THIS. 
CONTINUING TO ENFORCE THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, 
RESOLUTIONS THE RUSSIANS VOTED 
FOR, WERE RAISED BETWEEN THE 
TWO OF THEM. 
I HEARD IN A SUBSEQUENT MEETING 
WHERE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
VLADAMIR PUTIN REITERATED 
COMMITMENT TO DOING EACH OF 
THOSE TWO THINGS. 
>> TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR 
CONVERSATION WITH TIM CAIN 
ABOUT THE COMMUNIQUCFROM THE 
SINGAPORE SUMMIT AND THE 
DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED 
OUT IN REGARD TO HAVING A 
SURVEY, TO THE STARTING POINT 
OF THE DETAILED NUCLEAR 
AGREEMENT, WHEN YOU HAVE AN 
AGREEMENT REGARDING THE DETAILS 
OF HOW SUCH A SURVEY OF NORTH 
KOREAN MISSILES AND MATERIALS 
AND SO FORTH, WHEN YOU HAVE 
THAT AGREEMENT, WILL YOU BRIEF 
THIS COMMITTEE ON THAT? 
>> SIR, I'M SURE WE WILL BE 
ABLE TO SHARE SOME ELEMENTS OF 
THAT WITH YOU. 
I'M HARKENING BACK TO THE 
AGREEMENT IN WHICH THEY 
PROVIDED A DECLARATION THAT WAS 
KNOWINGLY FALSE AND THAT IS, THE
ADMINISTRATION KNEW IT DID NOT 
REFLECT ACCURATELY, THE HISTORY 
OF THE IRANIAN WEAPONS PROGRAM. 
I PROMISE YOU I WON'T DO THAT. 
I PROMISE I WON'T LIE ABOUT THE 
CONTENTS OF THE DECLARATION IT. 
IF WE DISAGREE OR THINK THEY ARE
WRONG, WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
BUT I WILL HAVE TO THINK 
THROUGH PRECISELY HOW, AND IN 
THE APPROPRIATE WAY, WE WOULD 
SHARE THAT INFORMATION. 
YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT NOT TO 
ALLOW A FALSE DECLARATION TO 
FORM A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF A 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT AND THE WAY 
IT DID. 
>> WE ALL HAD PRIVY NOT JUST TO 
THE BRIEFING, BUT THE ACTUAL 
DOCUMENT AND DETAILS AND WE 
HAVE THAT STANDARD. 
IN FACT, THOSE WERE MADE 
PUBLIC, AS WELL. 
WOULD YOU EXPECT TO MEET THOSE 
TWO STANDARDS, EVENTUALLY? 
>> WHEN THE AGREEMENT IS 
COMPLETE, YES. 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING 
ABOUT DRAWING UP THE PROCESS. 
I BELIEVE THE DOCUMENTS WERE 
MADE PUBLIC WHEN THE AGREEMENT 
WAS FINAL. 
WE HOPE TO BRING THE AGREEMENT 
TO CONGRESS AND OF COURSE, IT 
IS THE CASE THAT YOU WOULD NEED 
TO SEE THE UNDERPINNINGS OF 
THAT AGREEMENT AND PART OF IT 
WOULD BE THE SERIES OF 
DECLARATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH 
IT. 
>> I TELL YOU, IT DID BOTHER ME 
BECAUSE THOSE DETAILS HADN'T 
BEEN WORKED OUT YET AND THE 
PRESIDENT HAD CONCEDED TO 
SETTING ASIDE THE JOINT 
EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA. 
ONE OF THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADERS 
BRIEFED IN ADVANCE OF THAT 
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS -- >> I WILL 
LEAVE THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE. 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN MILITARY 
CHANNELS. 
>> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
BLAMED POOR RELATIONS WITH 
RUSSIA ON U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND 
I'M SURPRISED HE BLAMED U.S. 
FOOLISHNESS RATHER THAN RUSSIA 
ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND THE 
OCCUPATION OF EASTERN UKRAINE 
AND THEIR ATTACKS ON 
INDIVIDUALS IN BRITAIN AND THE 
SUPPORT OF THE SYRIAN 
GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY WERE USING 
BARREL BOMBS AND GAS ON THEIR 
OWN PEOPLE. 
AND, GIVEN THAT RUSSIA'S 
SIGNIFICANT CYBER ATTACK ON OUR 
ELECTIONS, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 
THE POOR RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA 
IS A RESULT OF U.S. 
FOOLISHNESS? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THERE ARE 
COUNTLESS REASONS. 
YOU IDENTIFIED SEVERAL. 
I COULD GO ON ABOUT THE REASON 
WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS PLACE 
WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADAMIR 
PUTIN AND HIS REGIME, TODAY, 
NOT A GOOD PLACE, TO BE SURE. 
A PLACE THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING
TO TRY TO RECONFIGURE, AT LEAST 
OF THE LEVEL OF MAKING SURE THE 
LEADERS UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, 
AND KNOW HOW EACH OTHER ARE 
THINKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM SET. 
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND 
APPROPRIATE AND -- HOPEFULLY, 
HE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. 
>> IT IS A NICE ESSAY. 
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION, 
BUT I WILL GO ON. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE IS NO 
LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT FROM 
NORTH KOREA AND WE CAN ALL 
SLEEP WELL. 
GIVEN THAT WE DON'T YET HAVE AN 
AGREEMENT ON EVEN SURVEYING 
STOCKPILE OF WHAT NORTH KOREA 
HAS OR AN AGREEMENT ON NEW 
WEAPONS OR MISSILES, OR AN 
AGREEMENT ON VERIFICATION 
STRATEGIES, SHOULDN'T WE MORE 
ACCURATELY HAVE THE VIEWPOINT 
THAT THERE STILL IS A NUCLEAR 
THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA? 
THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING TO 
ELIMINATE IT, BUT IT IS STILL A 
NUCLEAR THREAT AS OF TODAY? 
>> YES. I 
THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD AGREE 
THAT THE PRIMARY SYSTEMS THAT 
HAVE THREATENED AMERICA 
CONTINUE TO EXIST. 
WHAT HIS COMMENT WAS, I THINK, 
WAS THAT TENSION HAD BEEN 
GREATLY REDUCED. 
>> I WILL TAKE THAT 
DESCRIPTION. 
I'VE GOT 20 SECONDS AND I WANT 
TO ASK YOU ONE LESS QUESTION ON 
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPIC. 
45 HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS TRIEBOLD 
-- TRAVELED TO BURMA AND HAD 
DEVASTATING ATROCITIES. 
WE HAVE THE REPORT THAT OUR 
AMBASSADOR IS MAKING A 
STATEMENT. 
IS A TIME FOR THE SENATE TO ACT 
ON THESE SANCTIONS AGAINST THE 
BURMESE MILITARY THAT WE PASSED 
OUT OF THE SENATE FOREIGN 
RELATIONS COMMITTEE? 
>> I WILL LEAVE THE SENATORS TO 
DECIDE IF IT IS TIME FOR THE 
SENATE TO ACT. I 
CAN SEE THE UNDERPINNINGS YOU 
DESCRIBED, THE ATROCITIES, THEY 
ARE VERY REAL. 
>> I WOULD SAY THIS IS THE TYPE 
OF THING WHERE EXECUTIVE 
LEADERSHIP MAKES A DIFFERENCE 
AND GIVING DIRECTION TO THIS 
BODY. 
I WAS SEEKING YOURS AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S OPINION ON WHETHER 
IT IS TIME TO SEND A STRONG 
MISSION AGAINST ETHNIC 
CLEANSING AND GENOCIDE. 
CAN WE EXPECT SUCH LEADERSHIP 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OR YOURSELF? 
>> I REMEMBER WHAT SECRETARY 
TILLERSON DID BEFORE ME ON THIS 
ISSUE. 
YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE WILL BE 
SERIOUS AND LEAD ON THIS 
IMPORTANT ISSUE. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 
>> MR. SECRETARY, THANK YOU. 
I APPRECIATE YOUR STAMINA. 
YOU BEEN HERE QUITE A WELL AND 
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH 
I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP, 
AS YOU'VE FILLED THIS ROLE 
DURING THIS TUMULTUOUS PERIOD 
IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT SINCE YOU'VE 
TAKEN THIS POSITION, THE 
INTERACTION OUR OFFICE HAS HAD 
WITH MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT 
OF STATE AND WITH YOU, 
INDIVIDUALLY, HAS REALLY 
MARKEDLY IMPROVED. 
I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. 
ONE OF THE AXIOMS OF DIPLOMATIC 
OR MILITARY STRATEGY, IS THAT 
YOU WANT TO UNITE YOUR ALLIES 
AND DIVIDE YOUR ENEMIES. 
AS I SEE IT, THIS IS ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS 
BEEN SUCCEEDING IN DOING. 
HE SEEKS TO DIVIDE AND WEAKEN 
NATO, FOR EXAMPLE AND HE WANTS 
TO DIVIDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THE WAR -- THE MORE WE MAKE THE 
RUSSIAN MEDDLING A PARTISAN 
ISSUE, THE MORE WE PLAY INTO 
PUT IN'S HANDS. 
THE INTELLIENCE COMMUNITY HAS 
BEEN FAIR AND CONSISTENT THAT 
RUSSIA DID INDEED MEDDLE IN THE 
ELECTIONS. 
WE NEED TO STAND TOGETHER AS 
AMERICANS, NOT REPUBLICANS OR 
DEMOCRATS, WITH RESPECT TO THIS 
ISSUE. 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS 
MATTER, MR. SECRETARY? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK IT IS THE 
CASE THAT THE SOVIET UNION AND 
RUSSIA WITH THE EFFORTS TO 
UNDERMINE WESTERN DEMOCRACY ARE 
LONG AND CONTINUOUS AND 
OCCURRED IN 2016 AND I'M 
CONFIDENT THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE 
ENDEAVORING TO DIVIDE AND 
SEPARATE US FROM OUR ALLIES, TO 
CREATE SPACE AND TO FIND 
PARTNERS FOR THEMSELVES AROUND 
THE WORLD, IN THE SAME WAY WE 
WOULD GO OUT AND WORK 
DILIGENTLY WITH OUR ALLIES. 
I ALWAYS THINK THAT HAVING A 
UNITED DATES PROCESS, WHERE WE 
HAVE A SHARED GOAL THAT WILL 
INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
AMERICA PREVAILING AGAINST 
THESE CHALLENGES. 
>> I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU. 
I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I 
WILL ADOPT A TONE AND APPROACH 
TO THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE THAT 
IMPACTS ALL AMERICANS, AND 
RECOGNITION OF EVERYTHING YOU 
JUST SAID. 
MR. SECRETARY, ABOUT ONE HOUR 
AGO, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
CONVENED A JOINT PRESS 
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER. 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THE 
PRESIDENT AND BOTH PRESIDENTS 
ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD LAUNCH A 
BILATERAL U.S.-EU SET OF 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOAL OF 
REDUCING TERRORISTS, INCREASING 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN 
THE EU AND THE UNITED STATES AND
WORKING TOGETHER TO COUNTER THE 
PREDATORY ECONOMIC PRACTICES 
THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM COUNTRIES 
LIKE CHINA. 
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW ENCOURAGED 
I AM BY THIS. 
I THINK WITH OUR COLLECTIVE 
LEVERAGE BROUGHT TO BEAR, 
PERHAPS ULTIMATELY PULLING IN 
OTHER G-7 COUNTRIES LIKE THE 
JAPANESE, WE HAVE A REAL 
POSSIBILITY OF REDUCING THE 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT AND 
REDUCING THE INCIDENCES OF 
FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER WITH 
STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES DUMPING 
THINGS IN OUR OWN ECONOMY, 
PRECISELY WHAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS FOUR 
OBJECTIVES. 
DO YOU AGREE THAT THE U.S., 
MOVING FORWARD, HAS TO 
PRIORITIZE A TRADE DIALOGUE 
WITH THE EU TO ELIMINATE 
CURRENT RETALIATORY TARIFFS ON 
FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN 
PLACES LIKE INDIANA, AS WELL IS 
TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT CHINA'S 
NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES? 
>> DON'T FORGET KANSAS FARMERS, 
TOO. 
I DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF 
HAVING SEEN THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE BECAUSE I WAS 
SITTING HERE AND DID NOT SEE THE
ANNOUNCEMENT. I 
KNOW THIS WAS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS 
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN HIS 
CONVERSATIONS WITH JEAN-CLAUDE 
JUNCKER AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY 
MADE SOME PROGRESS AND THAT 
REGARD. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR 
WITH RESPECT TO TRADE POLICY. 
EUROPEANS WON'T ACCEPT OUR 
POLICIES AND IF OTHER MARKETS 
AREN'T OPEN, HE WILL DRIVE 
TOWARD ZERO TARIFFS, ZERO 
NONTARIFF BARRIERS AND ZERO 
SUBSIDIES. 
THAT IS THE PLACE HE IS TRYING 
TO GET TO FOR THE WHOLE WORLD 
AND HE IS CONFIDENT THAT WHEN WE
GOT THERE, AMERICANS WILL 
OUTCOMPETE THE REST OF THE 
WORLD. 
WEATHER MANUFACTURERS OR 
INNOVATORS OR FARMERS OR ALL OF 
THE ABOVE, THEY WILL ULTIMATELY 
BE SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WILL BE 
ENORMOUS COOPERATION. 
>> I FIND THIS EFFORT OF 
WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH THE 
EU AND OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES AS 
COHERENT AND WORKABLE, IF WE 
ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE 
GREATEST CHALLENGES, THOSE SEEN 
BY THE STATE CAPITALIST 
COUNTRIES. 
CHINA IS THE WORST OFFENDER. 
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CLARITY 
WITH RESPECT TO TRADE STRATEGY 
AS I WOULD LIKE TO AND THAT'S 
ONE OF THE REASONS I KEEP 
EMPHASIZING THAT WE NEED TO 
HAVE A WRITTEN ONE, JUST AS WE 
HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY 
STRATEGY. 
I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT, TODAY. 
LASTLY, MR. SECRETARY, MY HOME 
STATE OF INDIANA IS HOME TO 
23,000 BURMESE AMERICANS. AS I 
TRAVEL THE STATE AND LISTEN TO 
SO MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS THAT 
ARE BURMESE AMERICANS, THEY 
REALLY RATE -- THEY REITERATE 
THAT THEY HAVE GRAVE CONCERN 
REGARDING THE BURMESE MILITARY'S
ATROCITIES AGAINST THE ROHAN GOT
AND THEY WANT THOSE 
PERPETRATORS BROUGHT TO 
JUSTICE. 
NUMBER TWO, THEY REITERATE A 
DESIRE TO EXPAND TIES BETWEEN 
BURMA AND THE UNITED STATES. 
THEY EXPRESS CONCERN REGARDING 
THE TREATMENT OF CHIN 
CHRISTIANS IN BURMA. 
I KNOW YOU ARE HOSTING THE 
MINISTERIAL TO ADVANCE 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOCUSED ON 
COMBATING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION 
AND DISCRIMINATION AND AS WE 
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS WITHIN 
THAT FORUM, THE CRISIS IN 
ROHINGYA, WE WANT ALL RELIGIOUS 
MINORITIES INCLUDING CHRISTIANS 
TO BE RESPECTED. 
MR. SECRETARY, WILL THE 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE WORK WITH 
MY OFFICE TO NOT ONLY CONTINUE 
THE JOINT EFFORTS RELATED TO THE
ROHINGYA, WHICH I SUPPORT BUT 
ALSO TO ENCOURAGE THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT TO END ANY POLICIES 
THAT TREAT CHRISTIANS AS SECOND-
CLASS CITIZENS. 
>> YES, SENATOR, I WILL. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> SENATOR MURPHY? 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
MR. SECRETARY, FOR BEING HERE. 
I ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH MANY OF 
THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE 
CHAIRMAN AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING UP 
FOREIGN-POLICY ON A DAY BY DAY 
BASIS. I 
THINK YOU'VE GOT A TIGER BY THE 
TAIL WITH A DIFFICULT AND 
ENVIABLE JOB AND I APPRECIATE 
YOU SPENDING TIME WITH US THIS 
MORNING. 
WE FOCUS ON WORDS FROM THE 
PRESIDENT BECAUSE OUR ALLIES 
AND ADVERSARIES LISTEN TO THOSE 
WORDS AND CALIBRATE ACTIONS 
BASED UPON THOSE WORDS. 
WHILE YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT -- 20-30 HOURS LATER 
-- HE CORRECTED HIMSELF AFTER 
THE HELSINKI SUMMIT TO SAY THAT 
HE DID, INDEED, AGREE WITH U.S. 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND NOT 
WITH FOOD AND. 
FIVE DAYS LATER, HE WENT BACK 
ON TWITTER. 
HE SAID THIS -- SO, PRESIDENT 
OBAMA KNEW ABOUT RUSSIA BEFORE 
THE ELECTION. 
WHY DIDN'T HE DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT? 
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL OUR 
CAMPAIGN? 
BECAUSE, IT IS ALL A BIG HOAX, 
THAT'S WHY. 
THAT IS THE MOST RECENT 
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT, 
ú 
INTERFERENCE OF THE ELECTION IS 
ALL A BIG HOAX. 
MY QUESTION IS, WHY SHOULDN'T 
WE ACCEPT THIS MOST RECENT 
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT AS 
U.S. POLICY, RATHER THAN THE 
STATEMENT THAT YOU REFERENCED 
ON JULY 17? 
>> SENATOR, I CAN'T GO THROUGH 
THE LITANY OF ALL THE 
STATEMENTS YOU JUST GAVE. 
I HAVE A LIST FROM JANUARY 17, 
JUNE 17, AGAIN IN JULY AND I'M 
HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THEM. 
IN EACH OF THEM, THE PRESIDENT 
CONFIRMED HE UNDERSTOOD THAT 
RUSSIANS HAD MEDDLED IN THE 
ELECTION AND ALTHOUGH I 
COULDN'T RECOUNT THEM, I COULD 
TELL YOU NUMBERS OF TIMES WHEN 
I WAS PERSONALLY WITH HIM WHERE 
HE TOLD ME DIRECTLY THAT HE 
UNDERSTOOD THAT. 
AND, INDEED COSMA , PROVIDED 
GUIDANCE FOR PUSHING BACK ON 
THIS INTERFERENCE. 
I HAVE A CATALOG OF ITEMS TO DO 
JUST THAT. 
>> WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE MOST 
RECENT STATEMENT? 
>> YOU CAN SPECULATE AND DRAW 
YOUR INFERENCES FOR WHATEVER 
PURPOSES YOU CHOOSE BUT WHAT I 
CAN TELL YOU -- 
>> THERE IS NO INFERENCE. 
IT'S A STATEMENT FROM THE 
PRESIDENT IN WHICH HE SAYS THE 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 
U.S. ELECTION IS A HOAX FROM 
JULY 22ND. 
THERE IS NO INFERENCE I NEED TO 
DRAW FROM THAT. 
IT IS A SENATOR'S STATEMENT. 
>> SENATOR, YOU'RE CERTAINLY 
TRYING TO DRAW INFERENCES ABOUT 
THE AMERICAN POLICY AND I'M 
LAYING OUT FOR YOU AMERICAN 
POLICY. 
LET ME TALK TO ABOUT WHAT WE'VE 
DONE ON ELECTION INTERFERENCE, 
IF I MIGHT. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DRAW A 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS AND U.S. 
POLICY. 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SUGGEST IS 
THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS IS 
U.S. POLICY -- BECAUSE 
ADERSARIES AND ALLIES MAKE 
DECISIONS BASED ON THOSE 
COMMENTS -- LET ME DRILL DOWN 
ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT 
SENATOR CORKER RAISED. 
THOSE ARE THE COMMENTS MADE 
REGARDING THE POTENTIAL DEFENSE 
OR NONDEFENSE OF MONTENEGRO. 
TUCKER CARLSON ASKED THAT 
MONTENEGRO MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO 
A SMALL TO BE DEFENDED AND THE 
PRESIDENT UNDERSTAND DID -- 
SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THAT 
MONTENEGRO WAS A TINY COUNTRY 
WAS STRONG PEOPLE. 
I KNOW YOU WILL TELL ME THAT 
THE OFFICIAL POLICY OF THE U.S. 
IS TO DEFEND MONTENEGRO AND 
DEFEND OUR NATO ALLIES. 
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD 
BE CONCERNED THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WOULD DRAW A QUESTION AS TO 
WHETHER WE WOULD DEFEND 
MONTENEGRO? 
IN THE END, THAT IS A 
COMMUNICATION OF RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADAMIR PUTIN ABOUT 
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT IS GOING 
TO COME TO NATO'S DEFENSE. 
AS YOU KNOW, AN ATTACK ON NATO 
WON'T BE A RUSSIAN ARMY MOVING 
ACROSS THE BORDER, IT WILL BE A 
CYBER ATTACK OR THERE SHOULD BE 
QUESTIONED WEATHER THE U.S. 
SHOULD RESPOND, OR NOT. 
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE MIGHT 
BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESENT 
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
UTILITY OF THE UNITED STATES 
DEFENDING MONTENEGRO? 
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN UNAMBIGUOUSLY CLEAR AND I 
CAN READ YOU HIS POLICIES. 
>> HIS POLICIES OR THE SEPARATE 
STATEMENTS? 
I'M ASKING ABOUT THIS 
STATEMENT. 
EXPLAIN IT TO US. 
WHAT DID HE MEAN? 
>> SENATOR, THE POLICIES ARE, 
THEMSELVES, STATEMENTS, AS 
WELL. 
INDEED, THE MOST IMPORTANT 
STATEMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION 
MAKES. 
>> POLICIES ARE STATEMENTS AND 
STATEMENTS ARE POLICIES? 
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. I
MAKE LOTS OF STATEMENTS THAT 
AREN'T U.S. POLICY. 
THE PRESIDENT MAKES COMMENTS IN 
CERTAIN PLACES AND WE MEET AND 
LAYOUT STRATEGIES AND DEVELOP 
POLICIES, RIGHT? 
>> HOW I KNOW -- HOW WOULD I 
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? 
>> SENATOR, HERE'S WHAT YOU 
SHOULD LOOK AT. 
COMPARE THE FOLLOWING -- BARACK 
OBAMA SPEAKING TOUGH ON RUSSIA 
AND DOING NOTHING. 
>> THAT ISN'T TRUE. 
>> IT IS TRUE. 
>> A UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO 
REWRITE THE OBAMA RUSSIAN 
POLICY. 
>> THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE SET 
OF SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. 
>> THE MAN SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
MORE FLEXIBILITY AFTER. 
>> MY QUESTION ISN'T A BOAT 
THAT. 
>> I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THE 
FACTS. 
I'M TRYING TO GET TO U.S. 
POLICY. 
IT'S WHAT I DO. 
I'M AMERICA'S CHIEF DIPLOMAT 
IMPLEMENTING U.S. POLICY. 
>> I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN DEALT 
A TOUGH HAND AND YOU'VE DONE AN 
INCREDIBLE JOB WITH IT. 
LET ME ASK A LESS ADVERSARIAL 
QUESTION TO END WITH. 
YOU SAID TWO VERY IMPORTANT 
THINGS ON NORTH KOREA. 
YOU SAID THEY HAVE AGREED TO 
DENUCLEARIZE AND THAT THEY 
UNDERSTAND OUR DEFINITION OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 
>> WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS 
THAT THOSE STATEMENTS A LINK, 
AND THEY HAVE AGREED TO 
DENUCLEARIZE ACCORDING TO OUR 
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION. 
IS THAT YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY? 
>> THE DEFINITION WAS SET 
FORWARD AND DENUCLEARIZATION 
WAS AGREED TO. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE -- I 
DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT. 
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE YOU A 
HARD TIME. 
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 
IT. 
>> I'M TRYING TO ARTICULATE 
WHAT WAS AGREED TO. 
WE MADE CLEAR WHAT WE VIEWED AS 
THE SCOPE OF DENUCLEARIZATION 
AND IT IS NOT DISSIMILAR AS TO 
HOW THE U.N. HAS CHARACTERIZED 
IT AND THE SOUTH KOREANS 
CHARACTERIZED IT. 
WHEN WE DID THAT, THE NORTH 
KOREANS SAID YES, WE AGREE TO 
DENUCLEARIZE. 
THEIR AGREEMENT IS UPON OUR 
DEFINITION. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> SENATOR ISAKSON, THE 
COMMUNIQUCTHAT WE SAW COMING 
OUT OF THE SINGAPORE MEETING, 
THAT IS THE TOTAL OF THE 
AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH THEM? 
>> YES. 
WE'VE ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS 
AFTER THAT. 
IT IS ALSO THE CASE THAT THE 
AGREEMENT INCORPORATED THE 
DECLARATION THAT, IN TURN, INC. 
A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT, AS WELL. 
THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT IS STACKED 
ON WITH A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS, 
EACH OF WHICH IS ENCOMPASSED 
WITHIN THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN 
KIM. 
YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH THOSE 
AGREEMENTS ABOUT THINGS THE 
NORTH KOREANS HAVE COMMITTED 
TO. 
>> LOOK, I DON'T THINK ANY OF 
US WOULD EXPECT THERE WOULD BE 
MEETING IN SINGAPORE AND ALL 
THE ISSUES WOULD BE WORKED OUT. 
WE UNDERSTAND IT WILL TAKE A 
LONG TIME. 
>> I'VE SPENT ALL WEEK TRYING 
TO COME UP WITH INTUITIVE, 
BRILLIANT AND INCISIVE 
QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU, 
RECOGNIZING HOW INTELLIGENT AND 
ARTICULATE YOU ARE. 
>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
SECRETARY STATE, MIKE POMPEO 
ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM 
LAWMAKERS. 
THEY BEEN GRILLING HIM OF THE 
DETAILS ABOUT THE TWO OUR 
PRIVATE MEETING PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAD WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
VLADAMIR PUTIN, AS WELL AS 
OTHER FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, 
INCLUDING NORTH KOREA. 
>>> I'M TANYA RIVERO IN FOR 
ELAINE QUIJANO. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS 
TOP DIPLOMAT DEALT WITH 
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S FOREIGN POLICY 
ON WEDNESDAY. 
SECRETARY STATE, MIKE POMPEO 
FACED QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND 
ONE DAY AFTER PROPOSING A 
BAILOUT FOR FARMERS HURT BY HIS 
ADMINISTRATIONS TARIFFS, 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID 
THINGS ARE GOING WELL ON THE 
FREE-TRADE FRONT. 
>> ALREADY TODAY, THE UNITED 
STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION 
HAVE A $1 TRILLION BILATERAL 
TRADE RELATIONSHIP, THE LARGEST 
ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP ANYWHERE 
IN THE WORLD. WE WANT TO 
FURTHER STRENGTHEN THIS TRADE 
RELATIONSHIP TO THE BENEFIT OF 
ALL AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN 
CITIZENS. 
THIS IS WHY WE AGREED, TODAY, 
FIRST OF ALL, TO WORK TOGETHER 
TOWARD ZERO TARIFFS, ZERO 
NONTARIFF BARRIERS AND ZERO 
SUBSIDIES ON NON-AUTO 
INDUSTRIAL GOODS. 
 THANK YOU. 
>> THINGS LOOKED A LITTLE 
DIFFERENT ON CAPITOL HILL ON 
CAPITOL HILL WITH SENATORS 
PRESSING SECRETARY STATE, MIKE 
POMPEO ON WHAT HAPPENED DURING 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S ONE-ON-
ONE MEETING WITH RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADAMIR PUTIN LAST 
WEEK. 
THEY ALSO HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE STATUS OF TALKS WITH NORTH
