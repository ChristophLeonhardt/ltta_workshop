>> OKAY.
DO SOME MORE DIGGING OUT THERE
AND WE WILL BE GETTING TO YOU
THROUGH THE EVENING OF THE EARLY
MORNING HOURS.
JOINING US NOW FROM HERE IN OUR
WASHINGTON BUREAU IS RETIRED
LIEUTENANT COLONEL DANIEL DAVIS.
HE IS RETIRED AFTER 21 YEARS OF
ACTIVE SERVICE INCLUDING FOUR
TOURS IN COMBAT ZONES.
HE'S NOW A SENIOR FELLOW AND
MILITARY EXPERT AT DEFENSE
PRIORITIES.
GOOD MORNING HERE IN THE EARLY
HOURS.
I AM STRUCK BY THE IMAGE OF THE
AMERICAN FLAG WITH TWO FIRE
ENGINES, IT'S A REMARKABLE
MOMENT FOR AMERICA RIGHT NOW.
>> IT IS.
I ACTUALLY LANDED AT DULLES ONE
TIME AND THERE WERE TWO FIRE
TRUCKS OUT THERE THAT WERE
SHOOTING WATER AS THE PLANE WENT
UNDER IT.
>> THEY LIKE TO DO THAT AS A
SPECIAL GREETING.
>> THEY DO, AND IT MEANS A LOT
TO THEM.
>> BEFORE WE GET TO THE
SUBSTANCE OF ALL OF THIS, AN
IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DON'T
WANT TO FORGET, I SAW YOU
NODDING YOUR HEAD WHEN LELAND
WAS REPORTING ON THE FAMILY OF
AND WE CAN'T FORGET THAT THIS IS
A MURDEROUS REGIME THAT WE ARE
DEALING WITH.
WE ESSENTIALLY KILLED THIS YOUNG
MAN.
HE CAME BACK ALL TORTURED AND
BEATEN DOWN, AND YOU JUST HAVE
TO FEEL FOR HIS FAMILY TONIGHT.
>> YOU DO.
IT'S A TOUCHING MOMENT BECAUSE
SOME PEOPLE SAID LIKE IN THE
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, HE
WAS USING IT AS A PROP TO MAKE
HIS POINTS.
BUT THIS SHOWS THAT HE GENERALLY
FEELS FOR HIM.
>> SO WE ARE LEARNING TONIGHT
THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE MADE
THIS PROVISION.
THAT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THE
UNITED STATES IS PLAYING
OFFENSE.
>> YES.
THEY ARE PLAYING FIRM, AND THEY
ARE NOT GOING TO TALK FOR THE
SAKE OF TALKING.
IT'S A VERY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY YES,
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.
THEY DIDN'T PLAY AROUND OR PUSH
BACK AND SO IT'S A POSITIVE
DEVELOPMENT AND I HOPE IT
CONTINUES.
LIKE NORTH KOREA MAKE
SUGGESTIONS LIKE THIS, THEY
RELEASED PRISONERS AND THEN THEY
GO TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.
I TRIED IT, WE DID ALL THESE
THINGS, BUT WE ARE NOT GETTING
WHAT WE WANT.
I FOUND A FIST AND WALK AWAY.
HOW SKEPTICAL SHOULD WE BE
TONIGHT THAT THIS IS A LITTLE
BIT OF GOODWILL.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE
POWERFUL DOMINANT DECISION.
TIME IS NOT RUNNING OUT FOR US
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS.
OUR MILITARY, OUR POWERFUL
MILITARY DETERRENT CAN KEEP US
SAFE HERE BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.
HE CAN SAY, IF THIS ISN'T WORTH
THE WAIT, I CAN WALK AWAY FROM
HERE.
AND WE ARE OKAY.
ARE WE SEEING THE OUTLINES OF
THE TRUNK DOCTRINE?
>> I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO.
HIS INSTINCTS ARE VERY GOOD ON
FOREIGN POLICY AND IT HAS BEEN,
AND I HOPE TO SEE HIM CONTINUE
ON WITH THAT.
I THINK HE HAS A CHANCE BECAUSE
OF HIS DISRUPTIVE NATURE, ONE OF
THE REASONS HE GOT ELECTED IN
THE FIRST PLACE, LET'S PLAY A
BIG ROLE IN DIPLOMACY BECAUSE HE
HAS A BIG CHANCE HERE TO
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THAT NONE
OF THE 12 PRESIDENTS THAT CAME
BEFORE HIM HAS.
AND THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO HIS
