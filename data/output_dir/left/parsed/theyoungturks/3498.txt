I WAS THINKING THOUGH, YOU
HAVE THE NORMALIZATION COMING
FROM SOME ON THE RIGHT, AN
ORGANIZATION LIKE MEDIA MATTERS,
YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF, YOU
HAD A LONG SPAN WHERE OBAMA WAS
PRESIDENT, NOW YOU HAVE THIS
YEAR WITH TRUMP, WHAT IS YOUR
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
NOW?
>> THE CORE CRITIQUE IS THE
SAME, MISINFORMATION IS BAD, AND
SPECIFICALLY THAT IT ISN'T JUST
THAT MISINFORMATION IS AN
ACCIDENT, FOR A WHILE ORIGINALLY
AND FOR MUCH OF OUR MISSION IT
WAS ABOUT THAT THERE WAS AN
INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO MISINFORM,
TO POISON THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA,
AND IT USED TO BE A JUST A BUNCH
OF RIGHT-WING ACTORS, THEY WOULD
BULLY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA INTO
PICKING UP THEIR SLANT.
THAT'S
THE PART THAT'S RADICALLY
DIFFERENT IS THAT IT'S MORE
COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING, YOU
HAVE RUSSIAN ACTIVE MEASURES
PARTICIPATING TO SOME EXTENT,
AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT STORY
GETS OVERBLOWN IN TERMS OF WHEN
IT GETS REPORTED ON THEY AREN'T
GETTING TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF
IT, BUT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND
IT PLAIN HOW IT FITS TOGETHER IS
WE DID A LOT EARLY ON TO LOOK AT
WHAT IS THE FAKE NEWS PROBLEM,
WHAT DO THEY MEAN WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT THAT?
I THERE IS A
FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS UNDERSTAND,
A LOT OF IT IS COMING TO THESE
ONLINE COMMUNITIES LIKE 4CHAN,
THEY ARE CREATING AND DRIVING A
LOT OF WHAT BECOME NARRATIVES,
THEN A SECOND LAYER OF
STORYTELLERS WHICH ARE LARGELY
WEBSITES NOT DESIGNED FOR
IDEOLOGICAL PURPOSES BUT JUST TO
GET VIRAL TRAFFIC, AND WE FOUND
AN ASYMMETRY COME ON FACEBOOK
ALONE CONSERVATIVE LEANING SITES
ARE 2.5 TIMES THE SIZE OF LEFT
LEANING ONES.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT
HOW SOME OF THAT FITS INTO THE
FAKE NEWS PROBLEM, THAT'S HOW
YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF THESE
STORIES GO VIRAL AND HAVE THE
SATURATION THEY DO, IS BECAUSE
THERE'S THIS CONSTELLATION OF
IDEOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES, AND IF
YOU LOOK AT THAT FRAMEWORK IT
DOESN'T JUST EXPLAIN HOW THE
FAKE NEWS PROBLEM CAME IN, THEN
YOU CAN SEE WHERE BOTS AND OTHER
FORMS OF MANIPULATION ARE A
FACTOR.
SO FOR ME THE MISSION IS
HOW DO WE MONITOR THIS IN A WAY
THAT'S JUST CHASING EVERY FACT,
IT'S 10% NOT 12%, BUT WHAT CORE
NARRATIVES ARE COMING OUT AND
HOW DO THEY INFLUENCE THE
BROADER CONVERSATION?
AND LASTLY
WHAT KINDS OF DATA AND
INFORMATION DO WE NEED TO GIVE
TO PLATFORMS TO GET THEM TO ONE
RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM AND START
TO PUT IN PLACE SOLUTIONS THAT
AREN'T CENSORSHIP DRIVEN BUT
RATHER LOOKING AT, SAY, THE
CHEATING AND THE MANIPULATIONS,
THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST SHIFT
IS SPENDING MORE TIME ON MESSAGE
BOARDS THAN SAY FOX NEWS IN A
WAY, BUT IT MATTERS MORE.
IF YOU
GO BACK, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
MANY TIMES YOU CAN TRACE
SPECIFIC FOX NEWS SEGMENTS OR
EVEN DONALD TRUMP TWEETS TO A
4CHAN THREAD FROM TWO DAYS AGO.
>>IT DISSEMINATES FOR A COUPLE
DAYS, AND THEN IT HITS.
>>EXACTLY, TUCKER CARLSON AND
PEOPLE LIKE THAT SOLICIT
SEGMENTS FROM THEM.
IT USED TO
BE THE CASE THAT THESE
RIGHT-WING PLACES ARE THE
VANGUARD BUT NOW THEY ARE JUST
REPACKAGING THESE STORIES FOR AN
AUDIENCE THAT ISN'T USING 4CHAN.
>> ARE THESE THE PLACES WHERE
THERE IS A REVERBERATION OF
THESE MESSAGES -- IS IT MORE
POWERFUL THAN FOX NEWS, CNN,
MSNBC PUT TOGETHER?
>>WITHOUT A DOUBT, AND IT'S
REFLECTED IN EVERYTHING A
METRIC.
IN THE LAST CYCLE
STARTING IN THE SUMMERTIME FOR
THE FIRST TIME EVER THE
AGGREGATE CONSUMPTION OF THIS
HYPER IDEOLOGICAL AND FABRICATED
STORIES EXCEEDED THE TOTAL
CONSUMPTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM
ALL OF THE MAINSTREAM SITES
COMBINED.
AND WE HAD TO BE
GENEROUS IN THAT ANALYSIS AND
INCLUDE PLACES LIKE PEOPLE JUST
SO IT WASN'T SO DEPRESSING THAT
WE ALL WANT TO QUIT.
THAT THE
LANDSCAPE, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY
POWERFUL FORCES, AND THAT'S NOT
TO SAY THEY ARE ALL BAD, THIS
TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR NEW
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AS WELL,
THERE ARE HUGE ADVANTAGES, BUT
THAT ASYMMETRY IS A PROBLEM.
AND
ONE LAST PIECE I THINK IS MOST
STARTLING OF ALL, IN THE LAST
CYCLE THOSE THAT IDENTIFIED IS
LEFT OF CENTER, ALMOST 1 OUT OF
EVERY TWO PEOPLE THAT IDENTIFIED
LEFT OF CENTER DID NOT POST A
SINGLE THING RELATED TO POLITICS
OR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT ON THEIR
SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, THAT NUMBER
IS ONLY 8% ON THE CONSERVATIVE
SIDE.
WHICH IS A TESTAMENT TO
WIN SOMETHING ON THE LEFT GOES
VIRAL OR THEY DO HAVE AN
AUDIENCE, IT SHOWS THEY ARE
OVERCOMING NOT JUST THE
DISTRIBUTION ASYMMETRY BUT A PER
DISSIPATION GAP. AND FOR ME OUR
MISSION NOW IS AS MUCH ABOUT
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS HAPPENING
WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES AND
LANDSCAPES AND THE STRUCTURAL
PIECES AROUND IT AS IT IS ABOUT
SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THAT
ONE STAT, BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE
ASSUMPTION ABOUT GETTING BACK TO
POWER, ABOUT POLITICAL
ORGANIZING, IS BASED ON THE IDEA
THAT IF THEY JUST HAD THE RIGHT
MESSAGE OR THE BEST DIGITAL
STRATEGY THEY WILL FIND THE
PEOPLE.
AND IF MORE AND MORE OF
THOSE PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS
LEFT OF CENTER ARE TUNING OUT,
HOW DO YOU GET THEM BACK INCOME
HOW DO YOU MARKET TO THEM OR
PULL THEM IN IF THEY ARE
DISENGAGING, BECAUSE THEY JUST
DON'T WANT TO BE ABUSED BECAUSE
OF THE LANDSCAPE --
>>I WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED IT WAS
THAT HIGH.
>>IT'S A SCARY STATISTIC, AND I
SEE THAT IS A BIG PIECE OF OUR
CORE MISSION IS AS MUCH ABOUT
UNDERSTANDING IT AND WHAT IS
GOING INTO THESE COMMUNITIES AND
HOW THEY ARE SORT OF CREATING
NOT JUST THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN
THE DISSED ABUSE AND PLATFORMS
BUT EVEN BETWEEN PARTICIPATION,
AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO
START TO DEAL WITH IT?
>>THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.
WE HAVE
A LOT OF STUFF TO DO --
>> THE STEREOTYPE IS THAT
EVERYBODY JUST WANTS TO GET OUT,
THEY ARE TALKING AND ALL THAT,
BUT THAT'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN
PROGRESSIVES 
AND
NON-PROGRESSIVES.
