1
00:00:00,682 --> 00:00:02,284
ACHIEVEMENTS.

2
00:00:02,284 --> 00:00:03,018
>> Martha: VERY SPECIAL, VERY

3
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:05,287
SPECIAL MAN.

4
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:07,489
BRIT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

5
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:11,226
>> Martha: LET'S BRING IN

6
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:11,760
GENERAL JACK KEANE.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,229
HE WAS ABLE TO TALK ABOUT OTHER

8
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:14,997
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE

9
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:17,366
WORLD, BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

10
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:18,400
CHARLES THIS EVENING.

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,637
THE AMAZING GIFT OF HIS WRITING

12
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:23,305
AND HIS SWEETNESS.

13
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:25,207
>> IT IS SO TYPICAL OF HIM THAT

14
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:28,677
HE PREPARED US FOR TONIGHT.

15
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:30,646
AND THAT ELOQUENCE, TOUCHING

16
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:31,380
LETTER WHEN HE SAID GOODBYE TO

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,882
AMERICA AND TO THE WORLD.

18
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:35,317
AND TO EVERYBODY THAN OF HIM.

19
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:36,685
IT WAS REALLY, QUITE REMARKABLE.

20
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:40,522
IT IS SO TYPICAL OF CHARLES LIFE

21
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:40,989
IT IS SO TYPICAL OF CHARLES LIF

22
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:41,290
LIFE.

23
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,758
ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT

24
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:45,928
HIM IS DEALING WITH THIS TRAGIC

25
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:48,931
ILLNESS THAT HE HAD.

26
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,766
I HAD SOLDIERS REACH OUT TO ME,

27
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,936
THREE OF THEM, OVER THE LAST SIX

28
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:54,670
YEARS WHO HAD SERIOUS INJURIES

29
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,938
LIKE HIS.

30
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:58,140
AND THE FIRST TIME I APPROACHED

31
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,907
CHARLES ABOUT IT, THEY WANTED TO

32
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:01,843
TALK TO HIM.

33
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:03,445
HE SAID, OF COURSE.

34
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:04,780
I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY.

35
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,185
HERE IS A WAY -- I SAID, I KNOW

36
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:11,553
YOU PROBABLY DO A LOT OF THIS,

37
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:13,288
THIS GOES ON IN MY LIFE.

38
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:15,524
AND HE JUST DEALT WITH THAT

39
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:18,760
ISSUE.

40
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,461
HE SAID, I'M GOING TO TELL HIM

41
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,228
SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY NOT WANT

42
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:21,330
TO HEAR.

43
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,366
AND HE SAID, -- HE DOESN'T TALK

44
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:25,867
ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY, OF COURSE.

45
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,569
AND HE SAYS, I AM GOING TO TELL

46
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,472
THEM, THE THING THAT ENABLED ME

47
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:34,076
TO GO ON WITH MY LIFE AND HAVE A

48
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,111
MEANINGFUL LIFE, DESPITE THIS

49
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:39,615
TRAGIC ILLNESS WAS A HUNDRED

50
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:40,248
PERCENT ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT

51
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:40,616
HAPPENED.

52
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:41,283
WITHOUT THAT ACCEPTANCE AND

53
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:42,084
KNOWING THAT I WILL NEVER WALK

54
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,087
AGAIN, I WILL NEVER BE, I WILL

55
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:47,322
NEVER BE THE PREVIOUS

56
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:47,856
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

57
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,725
I WILL NEVER HAVE ANY OF THAT

58
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:50,125
PREVIOUSLY.

59
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,426
I'M NOT GOING TO THROW THE REST

60
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:53,895
OF MY LIFE AWAY, MENTALLY,

61
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:54,563
EMOTIONALLY, AND SPIRITUALLY

62
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:55,764
BECAUSE OF IT.

63
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:57,699
THAT'S IS WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL

64
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:58,100
THEM.

65
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,834
HOPEFULLY, IT WILL BE OF SOME

66
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,702
ASSISTANCE TO THEM.

67
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:03,038
WE HAD A RELATIONSHIP IN AND

68
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:05,907
AROUND THE GREENROOM AND FOX.

69
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:09,044
WE NEVER, MARTHA --

70
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,179
>> Martha: THAT IS WHERE THE

71
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:11,880
BEST CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN, BY

72
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,715
THE WAY.

73
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,917
>> WE TALK ABOUT BASEBALL, WE

74
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:16,618
CHARACTERIZED IT AS A THINKING

75
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:17,753
MAN'S SPORT.

76
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:20,522
WE WERE A LITTLE BIT ARROGANT

77
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:21,957
ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S

78
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:22,557
FASCINATIONS WITH OTHER

79
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:23,659
ENDEAVORS IN AMERICA.

80
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,861
BUT WE LOVED THAT.

81
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:29,498
THEN, ALWAYS, IT GOT AROUND TO

82
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:30,899
CHARLES KNEW THAT I HAD A

83
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:31,867
BACKGROUND DIFFERENT FROM HIS.

84
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:32,934
IT WAS ALWAYS AFTER SOME KERNEL

85
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,870
OF INFORMATION.

86
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,904
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

87
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,506
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS?

88
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,474
WHAT IS THIS ISSUE, HERE,

89
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:42,511
DEALING WITH IRAQ, OR

90
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,745
AFGHANISTAN?

91
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:44,446
HAS MIND WAS ALWAYS WORKING.

92
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:45,547
WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME FUN WITH

93
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,215
IT, A COUPLE OF TIMES.

94
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:48,684
I AM SITTING IN THE GREENROOM, I

95
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:52,654
TALKED TO AT ABOUT THE MOCK HIM

96
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:53,321
ABOUT IT

97
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,459
>> Martha: DID HE GIVE YOU ANY

98
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:57,559
CRITIC

99
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:58,427
>>

100
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:00,662
HE BREAKS HIS BACK IN THAT

101
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:01,063
WHEELCHAIR.

102
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:04,066
MAKE SURE THAT HE HASN'T GONE.

103
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,668
HE SAID, OKAY GENERAL.

104
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:07,903
I WAS A AGAIN TONIGHT.

105
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:08,937
I TOOK THE INFORMATION, I GIVE

106
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:12,908
ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT WHATSOEVER.

107
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:16,812
I WAS SO HONORED AND HUMBLED BY

108
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:17,446
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER USING

109
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:18,447
ANYTHING THAT HE EVER HAD TO

110
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:18,714
SAY.

111
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:22,184
WHAT A CRITICAL THINKER, HIS

112
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:23,852
ABILITY TO ANALYZE, A WISE MAN

113
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:24,720
TO BE SURE.

114
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,022
AND THEN, MARTHA, AS YOU KNOW,

115
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:30,459
SO GRACIOUS AND HUMBLE ABOUT IT.

116
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,627
GOD GAVE HIM A GIANT OF A MIND

117
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:34,429
AND HE USED IT.

118
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,732
HE USED IT TO ITS FULLEST.

119
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,300
HE MADE LIFE BETTER AND LET

120
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,269
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND COMPLICATED,

121
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:41,336
AND

122
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:42,204
TRICYCLE ISSUES

123
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,474
I CAN IMAGINE ALL OF THE ISSUES

124
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,442
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN

125
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:49,311
MADE BETTER BECAUSE OF

126
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:50,245
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

127
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,680
THEY BEEN ABSOLUTELY EXTRA

128
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,047
ORDINARY.

129
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,548
AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, HE IS A

130
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,118
REGULAR GUY.

131
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:56,718
HE IS SO APPROACHABLE.

132
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:58,420
HE IS A REAL GUY.

133
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,288
AND YOU CAN HAVE FUN WITH HIM,

134
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:01,890
AND ENJOYED HIS COMPANY.

135
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,825
I DID NOT HAVE THE LONG,

136
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:04,526
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP THAT SO

137
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,361
MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD.

138
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,797
BUT I WILL TELL YOU UP, MY

139
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:09,431
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM WAS

140
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,332
MEANINGFUL.

141
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:12,234
AUNT,

142
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:13,668
I LOVE TO BEING AROUND THE GUY

143
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:16,904
AND I MISS HIM TERRIBLY.

144
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:17,906
>> Martha: YOU DIDN'T MESS

145
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:18,406
AROUND WITH THAT.

146
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,476
>> HE DROVE THE CONVERSATION.

147
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:22,043
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.

148
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:22,577
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

149
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,713
I THINK WE HAVE THE MOMENT OF

150
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,381
SILENCE AT NATIONALS PARK THIS

151
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,617
EVENING IN MEMORY OF CHARLES.

152
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:31,686
THIS IS AN IMAGE FROM THAT,

153
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:32,888
EARLIER THIS EVENING.

154
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:33,989
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A PLACE THAT

155
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:37,459
HE LOVED SO MUCH, AND THEY LOVED

156
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,226
THE FACT THAT HE LOVED THEM.

157
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:41,630
THEY WERE HIS TEAM.

158
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,998
AND THAT CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER

159
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:43,765
LOVED NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE IN

160
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,067
THE STADIUM.

161
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:47,068
I REALLY ENJOY THE PICTURES IN

162
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:48,570
THE VIDEOS OF BRET BAIER AND HIM

163
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:48,870
THERE.

164
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,806
HE WENT WITH SO MANY OF HIS

165
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:54,509
FRIENDS FROM "SPECIAL REPORT."

166
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,880
IT IS DEFINITELY A HEARTBREAKING

167
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,815
AND POTENT MOMENT FOR ALL THE

168
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,484
PEOPLE AND NATIONAL STADIUM.

169
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:04,119
>> THEY WILL CELEBRATE CHARLES

170
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,287
FOR YEARS TO COME.

171
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,488
BASEBALL WAS AN EXTENSION OF HIS

172
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:06,788
LIFE.

173
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:08,523
IT HAD REAL MEANING TO HIM.

174
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:10,392
HE UNDERSTOOD THE GAME, THE

175
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:10,826
COMPLICATION.

176
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:11,693
MOST PEOPLE GET BORED BY

177
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:13,295
BASEBALL BECAUSE IT IS TOO SLOW.

178
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:14,763
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,

179
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:16,498
IF YOU ARE REALLY INTO THE GAME,

180
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:18,433
YOU ARE WATCHING EVERY PITCH,

181
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:19,301
AND YOU'RE THINKING WHAT THE

182
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:20,569
PICTURE IS GOING TO DO, WHAT THE

183
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,538
BATTER IS GOING TO DO, AND HE

184
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:24,472
UNDERSTOOD THE GAME FULLY AND

185
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:25,106
COMPLETELY.

186
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,374
IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

187
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:26,875
OUT THERE.

188
00:05:26,875 --> 00:00:00,000
HE LOVED THE GAME, HE LOVED THE
