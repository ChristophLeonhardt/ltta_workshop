"SPECIAL REPORT." Bret: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DIGGING IN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. HE WANTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TURNED BACK AT THE BORDER WITHOUT SEEING A JUDGE AND HE INSISTS IT'S UP TO CONGRESS TO ACT QUICKLY TO FIX A BROKEN SYSTEM. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS STARTS US OFF ON THE NORTH ONE TONIGHT. THE TALKS TOXIC ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THIS SUMMER'S ILLEGAL CRISIS ON THE BORDER CONTINUES TO BUILD WITH TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS BEING THROWN OUT OF RESTAURANTS AND OF THE PRESIDENT WANTING TO THROW ILLEGAL MIGRANTS OUT OF THE COUNTRY. MEETING WITH JORDAN'S KING TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS FOCUSED ON THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS. BUT IT WAS AGAIN IMMIGRATION THAT PIQUED HIS INTEREST IN A Q&A WITH REPORTERS. President Trump: WE WANT STRONG BORDERS AND WE WANT NO CRIME. STRONG BORDERS, WE WANT NO CRIME. THE DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN BORDERS, AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CRIME.

THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO FIX OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM COMPLETELY, NOT JUST TINKER WITH IT.
