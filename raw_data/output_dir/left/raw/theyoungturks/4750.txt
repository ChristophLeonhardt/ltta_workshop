1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,620
IN THE PAST DAY, LONDON WAS
ONCE AGAIN THE TARGET OF A

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,620
TERROR ATTACK --

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:24,109
>>FROM WHAT I HAVE READ, THESE
PEOPLE HAD LEFT THE MIDNIGHT

4
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,960
PRAYER AT THIS MOSQUE, HAD
WALKED VERY CLOSE TO THE MOSQUE,

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,240
AND HAD FOUND AN ELDERLY MAN WHO
HAD COLLAPSED FOR SOME

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,910
HEALTH-RELATED REASON AND WERE
AIDING HIM WHEN THEY WERE HIT BY

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,390
THIS MONSTER WITH HIS VAN.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,690
SO
EVEN WORSE, AND ONE DID AND UP

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,690
DYING --

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:54,000
>>AND I HAVE READ THAT THE IMAM
AT THAT MOSQUE --

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,061
>>I'M SURE THEY DIDN'T
APPRECIATE THAT AT THE TIME BUT

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,800
THAT'S OF COURSE THE RIGHT THING
TO DO IN THAT CASE --

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:14,990
>>THERE WAS INITIALLY -- AND
THIS IS ONE SMALL ASPECT, OF THE

14
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,740
SEA THE TRAGEDY IS THE DEATH AND
THE INJURIES -- BUT IN THE

15
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,040
INITIAL REPORTS THAT ANOTHER VAN
HAD RAMMED INTO SOMEONE, AND IN

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,659
FACT IN THE PAST DAY SOMEONE
ALSO RAN THEIR CAR INTO A POLICE

17
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,990
OFFICER'S VEHICLE IN PARIS,
AGAIN THANK FULLY ONLY THE

18
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,280
DRIVER WAS KILLED -- THERE WAS
SOME INITIAL INTEREST IN THIS

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,579
ATTACK AND VERY QUICKLY PEOPLE
MOVED ON AND DIDN'T REALLY CARE

20
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,579
TOO MUCH.

21
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,060
I NOTICED THAT ON FOX
NEWS AND BREITBART, THE

22
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,630
TERRORIST CENTRAL WEBSITES, THEY
DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,630
I DIDN'T SEE

24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,750
ANYTHING FROM DONALD FROM ABOUT
THIS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,229
WERE INTERESTED WHEN THERE WAS
LAST A TERROR ATTACK,

26
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,610
GRANTED THAT WAS DAYS AGO, ONCE
IT TURNED OUT THAT THIS

27
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,700
GAVE TARGETED MUSLIMS RATHER
THAN BEING A MUSLIM,

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,619
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LITTLE LESS
INTEREST.

29
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,490
>>THAT'S SURPRISING TO JUST
ABOUT NOBODY.

30
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,549
I THINK THIS IMAM

31
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,470
SHOULD SET THE EXAMPLE FOR
EVERYBODY.

32
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,500
THERE WERE PEOPLE

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,531
TRYING TO KICK AND PUNCH THIS
DRIVER, WHO IT TURNS OUT IS A

34
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,580
WELSH FATHER OF FOUR.

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,620
>>WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE SHOUTED
HE WANTS TO KILL ALL MUSLIMS

36
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,020
AT THE SCENE, WE NEVER KNOW FOR
SURE WITH THESE REPORTS.

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,700
>>AND IN THE VAN AFTERWARDS HE
WAS BLOWING KISSES TO PEOPLE.

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,580
SOME OF THE EARLY REPORTS I SAW
-- USUALLY AFTER THESE YOU SAY I

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,110
CAN'T BELIEVE JOHN DID THIS, HE
WAS ALWAYS A QUIET --

40
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,040
>>YOU COULD'VE USED SOME OTHER
NAME, BUT --

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,450
>>I COULD HAVE.

42
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,450
MARK.

43
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,480
BUT THE
PEOPLE I SAW TALKING ABOUT HIM

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,440
SAY, IT'S LIKE HIM.

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,650
IT'S NOT
SURPRISING.

46
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,650
THAT'S JUST

47
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,700
ANECDOTAL, BUT REALLY
UNDERSCORING ALL OF THIS IS THE

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,150
STORY OF THIS IMAM, WHO IS JUST
LIKE MOST PEOPLE WITHIN HIS

49
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,230
RELIGION, SAYING GET AWAY, STOP
BEING BRUTAL TO THIS GUY.

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,230
WE

51
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,250
WILL ARREST HIM -- PROTECTED
THIS GUY, AND THAT WILL BE HIS

52
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,230
LAST MEMORY OF A NIGHT THAT WILL
CHANGE HIS LIFE, TALKING ABOUT

53
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,320
THE KILLER, IS THAT THIS IMAM
PROTECTED AND SAVED HIS LIFE.

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,290
>>IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING RIGHT
IN THAT STORY WAS ASSOCIATED

55
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,290
WITH THAT IMAM.

56
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,540
AND HONESTLY
WITH THE COOLHEADED NEIGHBOR OF

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,840
LONDON, IT'S A REAL EXAMPLE AS
WE LOOK AT OUR LEADERSHIP AND

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,480
SEE EVERYTHING POLITICIZED AND
DIVIDED, HE'S HAVING TO RIDE

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,120
HERD OVER A CITY THAT IS
BRINGING TOGETHER A LOT OF

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,450
DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES BUT IS
ALSO THE FOCUS OF TERRORISM, AND

61
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,900
IT'S A LOT OF ONE-OFF TERRORISM.

62
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,290
A LOT OF COPYCAT TERRORISM, ALL

63
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,580
THE SORT OF THING.

64
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,569
SO HIS JOB IS
A TOUGH ONE, AND IT'S NO SMALL

65
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:57,540
FOOTNOTE THAT HE HIMSELF IS
MUSLIM, TO PERHAPS BE THE

66
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,490
RIGHT GUY AT THIS TIME FOR THAT
CITY.

67
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,290
>>HE'S UNDER A LOT OF, I WOULD
SAY, SCRUTINY TOO BECAUSE OF THE

68
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,830
FIRE THAT JUST HAPPEN THERE
SEPARATE FROM THE SHOOTINGS,

69
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,850
IT'S A TERRIBLE TIME TO BE MAYOR
OF LONDON, BUT AS YOU SAID MAYBE

70
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,760
A GOOD TIME TO HAVE A MUSLIM
MAYOR.

71
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,040
BUT THE FIRE IS AN

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,310
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THING HE'S
TAKING HEAT FOR.

73
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,860
>>THANKFULLY SO FAR IN THE WAKE
OF THIS TERROR ATTACK DONALD

74
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,510
TRUMP HAS NOT ATTACKED HIM ON
TWITTER, BUT WE WILL SEE.

75
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:42,660
THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER OF
THE U.K., SAID --

76
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,991
>>THAT SENTIMENT WAS ECHOED BY
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE

77
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,910
INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR THE
STUDY OF RADICALIZATION, WHO

78
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,910
SAID --

79
00:04:52,910 --> 00:05:05,310
>>THAT'S THE THING, THEY ARE
JUST LOOKING TO GET PEOPLE WHO

80
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,890
ARE FANS OF THEM TO ATTACK
PEOPLE, THEY WANT THEIR OWN

81
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,639
PEOPLE, THEY WANT MUSLIMS IN THE
WEST, TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO

82
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,780
PLACE IN SOCIETY.

83
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,990
THEY WANT THEM
TO FEEL LIKE THE ONLY PLACE THEY

84
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,440
CAN TURN IS TO SOME SORT OF
RADICALIZATION.

85
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
AND IT DOESN'T

86
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,220
HURT THEIR MISSION WHEN PEOPLE
ON THE OTHER SIDE FEEL LIKE,

87
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,820
WELL, THEY KILLED SOME OF OURS,
WE WILL KILL SOME OF THEM.

88
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,820
WHICH

89
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,440
IS APPARENTLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING
IN THIS CASE.

90
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
JOHN OLIVER HAD A

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,280
GREAT RESPONSE TO I BELIEVE THE
MANCHESTER BOMBING -- IT MIGHT

92
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,270
HAVE BEEN THE STABBING, ACTUALLY
-- TALKING ABOUT THE RESILIENCY

93
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,300
OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE IN THE
FACE OF THIS, BUT THIS HAS BEEN

94
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,690
A ROUGH SET OF WEEKS FOR
THOSE IN THE U.K.,

95
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,650
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE AREA OF
LONDON, WHERE IT FEELS THAT

96
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,300
YOU CAN'T GO A COUPLE OF DAYS
WITHOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

97
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,620
>>THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT QUEEN
ELIZABETH, WHO, WITH HER

98
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,950
GRANDSON AND ONE OF HER SONS,
WAS VISITING SOME OF THE VICTIMS

99
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:13,720
FROM MANCHESTER, TO THE TOWER
FIRE, TO THE STABBING, AND HOW

100
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,470
PEOPLE HAVEN'T FELT THIS WAY, OR
OLDER BRITONS HAVEN'T FELT THIS

101
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,400
WAY, SINCE THE WAR.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,570
WHEN THE
MONARCH WOULD GO FROM PLACE TO

103
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:29,720
PLACE DURING THE WAR, IT WAS
EDWARD THEN, BUT IT'S AMAZING

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,880
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.

105
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,770
WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

106
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,770
THERE IS SOMEBODY --

107
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,420
THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING ALMOST
ON A WEEKLY BASIS.

108
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,650
>>THERE IS A SENSE OF OUR MOST A
SIEGE MENTALITY THERE.

109
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,650
AND

110
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:48,070
TERRORISM IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT KEEPS THE PUBLIC ON EDGE,

111
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,370
AND I THINK JOHN CORRECTLY
IDENTIFIES THAT THEY WANT THAT

112
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,320
ANXIETY, THEY WANT THE MUSLIM
COMMUNITY TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY

113
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,210
HAVE TO HANG TOGETHER,
ASSIMILATING WITH THIS

114
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,660
HETEROGENEOUS COMMUNITY OF
LONDON ISN'T WHAT WE WANT.

115
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,350
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS SO
SPECIAL ABOUT LONDON, I THINK

116
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,639
THEY DO HAVE SORT OF AN
INTEGRATED COMMUNITY, PEOPLE

117
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,730
FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
HISTORICALLY WITH DIFFERENT

118
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,000
FAITHS, AND SORT OF THE CROSS
POLLINATION OF THESE RELIGIONS.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,940
IN A SENSE LONDON WILL BE A
TOUGH NOT TO CRACK IF THEY ARE

120
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,440
TRYING TO DIVIDE THESE
COMMITTEES.

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,100
>>IT'S EASY TO SEE IN THE SHORT
SPAN OF TIME THESE INCIDENTS,

122
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,620
WHICH ARE TRAGIC, AND THINK THAT
THEY MUST BE MAKING HEADWAY, BUT

123
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,190
IT'S INCREDIBLY LIKELY THAT THEY
ARE NOT.

124
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,190
AS YOU SAID, THIS IS

125
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,960
NOT SOME NEW THING WHERE YOU
HAVE DIVERSITY IN LONDON.

126
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
THAT'S

127
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,350
THE HISTORIC STATE OF LONDON.

128
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,040
AND I AGREE, I THINK THEY WILL

129
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,810
HAVE VERY HARD TIMES ADVANCING
THEIR MISSION IN THE

130
00:07:45,810 --> 00:00:00,000
PARTICULAR WAY THEY WANT.
