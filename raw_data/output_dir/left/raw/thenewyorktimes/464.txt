1
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,652
We're giving you know the
community an opportunity to

2
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,821
know that they can relax,

3
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,425
knowing that their children are
here and are here safely.

4
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,160
They're getting their homework
done.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,929
They're being fed
enrichment programs.

6
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,631
They're being fed
STEM programs.

7
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:35,068
They are writing. 
They're reading.

8
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,704
I mean we're trying, We
try to do everything that

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,574
we can think of to help
them become well-rounded.

10
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,386
Our funding comes completely
from 21st Century.

11
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,222
We are a federally funded
program.

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,693
And if they did not
provide the funding, you know,

13
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,130
for our afterschool program, we
wouldn't have a program.

14
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,147
They're hardworking students.

15
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:26,519
And the program 
allows them an opportunity

16
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,290
to be enriched with
other activities.

17
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,160
But they're not paying for it
because

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,162
their parents can't afford to
pay for it.

19
00:01:36,162 --> 00:00:00,000
And that's the glory of the
program.
