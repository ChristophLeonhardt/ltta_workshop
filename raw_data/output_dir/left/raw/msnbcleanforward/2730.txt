00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,029
COURT IN TWO SEPARATE DECISIONS, ONE INVOLVING A STATEWIDE

44
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,530
ONE INVOLVING A STATEWIDE CHALLENGE TO REDISTRICTING IN

45
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,098
CHALLENGE TO REDISTRICTING IN WISCONSIN, ONE INVOLVING A

46
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,401
WISCONSIN, ONE INVOLVING A CHALLENGE TO A SPECIFIC

47
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,002
CHALLENGE TO A SPECIFIC CONGRESSIONAL DIRECT IN

48
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,336
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECT IN MARYLAND, THE COURT HAS DECLINED

49
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,038
MARYLAND, THE COURT HAS DECLINED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

50
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,740
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. NOW, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.

51
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,341
NOW, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. IN THE WISCONSIN CASE THEY SAY

52
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:26,877
IN THE WISCONSIN CASE THEY SAY THAT THE CHALLENGERS HERE DON’T

53
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,312
THAT THE CHALLENGERS HERE DON’T MEET THE LEGAL TEST FOR BEING

54
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:34,919
MEET THE LEGAL TEST FOR BEING ABLE TO BRING A CASE IN FEDERAL

55
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:35,653
ABLE TO BRING A CASE IN FEDERAL COURT BECAUSE THEY’RE VOTE FRRS

56
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,521
COURT BECAUSE THEY’RE VOTE FRRS ALL OVER THE STATE AND THEY

57
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,721
ALL OVER THE STATE AND THEY DON’T NECESSARILY LIVE IN THE

58
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:38,922
DON’T NECESSARILY LIVE IN THE DISTRICTS THAT THEY’RE

59
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:39,323
DISTRICTS THAT THEY’RE CHALLENGING.

60
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,958
CHALLENGING. SO FOR THAT REASON THEY SAY THEY

61
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,027
SO FOR THAT REASON THEY SAY THEY JUST DON’T HAVE THE STANDING.

62
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,729
JUST DON’T HAVE THE STANDING. IN THE MARYLAND CASE THEY

63
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,865
IN THE MARYLAND CASE THEY BASICALLY DECLINED TO ENGAGE ON

64
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:48,899
BASICALLY DECLINED TO ENGAGE ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE.

65
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,837
THE MERITS OF THE CASE. THEY SIMPLY SAY THAT AN

66
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,871
THEY SIMPLY SAY THAT AN INJUNCTION ISSUED BY THE LOWER

67
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:55,106
INJUNCTION ISSUED BY THE LOWER COURT WILL STAND.

68
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,141
COURT WILL STAND. SO IT’S A BIG DEFEAT FOR PEOPLE

69
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,876
SO IT’S A BIG DEFEAT FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE HOPING THAT THIS TIME,

70
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,378
WHO WERE HOPING THAT THIS TIME, THIS TERM WOULD BE THE ONE WHERE

71
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,779
THIS TERM WOULD BE THE ONE WHERE THE SUPREME COURT WOULD ACTUALLY

72
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,881
THE SUPREME COURT WOULD ACTUALLY ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE OF PARTISAN

73
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,616
ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE OF PARTISAN GARY MANNEDERING.

74
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,684
GARY MANNEDERING. NOW, WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

75
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,786
NOW, WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? BECAUSE THE CHALLENGERS SAYING

76
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,690
BECAUSE THE CHALLENGERS SAYING WITH THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND

77
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,424
WITH THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENTIFIC

78
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,493
SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY WE’VE GOT TONT POINT

79
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,295
TECHNOLOGY WE’VE GOT TONT POINT NOW WHERE PEOPLE ELECTED TO

80
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,197
NOW WHERE PEOPLE ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND LEGISLATURES ARE

81
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:22,100
CONGRESS AND LEGISLATURES ARE CHOOSING THEIR VOTERS INSTEAD OF

82
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,203
CHOOSING THEIR VOTERS INSTEAD OF VOTERS CHOOSING THEIR LEC TRIV

83
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:25,670
VOTERS CHOOSING THEIR LEC TRIV REPRESENTATIVES.

84
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,671
REPRESENTATIVES. A THAT THEY ENGINEERED THE

85
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,172
A THAT THEY ENGINEERED THE DIRECTS SO THEY REMAIN

86
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:29,273
DIRECTS SO THEY REMAIN PERMANENTLY SAFE FOR THE

87
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,007
PERMANENTLY SAFE FOR THE MAJORITY PARTY.

88
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,276
MAJORITY PARTY. THEY JAM ALL THE MINORITY PARTY

89
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:36,213
THEY JAM ALL THE MINORITY PARTY OPPONENTS INTO A SMALL NUMBER OF

90
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,782
OPPONENTS INTO A SMALL NUMBER OF DISTRICTS AS THEY CAN AND SPREAD

91
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,817
DISTRICTS AS THEY CAN AND SPREAD THE REST OUT SO THEY CAN NEVER

92
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,152
THE REST OUT SO THEY CAN NEVER GET A CRITICAL MASS.

93
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,220
GET A CRITICAL MASS. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NUMBER

94
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,455
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NUMBER ONE WE DON’T KNOW WHETHER

95
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,722
ONE WE DON’T KNOW WHETHER JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY WHO HAS

96
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,624
JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY WHO HAS BEEN AMONG THE CONSERVATIVES,

97
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,992
BEEN AMONG THE CONSERVATIVES, THE MOST POTENTIALLY RECEPTIVE

98
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,027
THE MOST POTENTIALLY RECEPTIVE TO THIS CLAIM, WHETHER HE’S

99
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,462
TO THIS CLAIM, WHETHER HE’S GOING TO STAY ON THE COURT FOR

100
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,996
GOING TO STAY ON THE COURT FOR ANOTHER TERM WHEN THE

101
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,097
ANOTHER TERM WHEN THE CHALLENGERS COULD PERHAPS TRY

102
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,699
CHALLENGERS COULD PERHAPS TRY THIS AGAIN.

103
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,535
THIS AGAIN. BUT, CLEARLY IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM

104
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,137
BUT, CLEARLY IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM WHEN BOTH THESE CASES WERE

105
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:00,238
WHEN BOTH THESE CASES WERE ARGUED THAT THE JUSTICES ARE

106
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:04,342
ARGUED THAT THE JUSTICES ARE JUST NOT COMFORTABLE THAT -- YOU

107
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,744
JUST NOT COMFORTABLE THAT -- YOU KNOW, GERRYMANDERING IS AN

108
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,046
KNOW, GERRYMANDERING IS AN ESSENTIALLY PARTISAN TASK AND

109
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,015
ESSENTIALLY PARTISAN TASK AND THE COURTS DON’T LIKE TO SECOND

110
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,349
THE COURTS DON’T LIKE TO SECOND GUESS POLITICAL PARTISAN ISSUES.

111
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,550
GUESS POLITICAL PARTISAN ISSUES. SO THE CHALLENGE FOR THE

112
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:15,219
SO THE CHALLENGE FOR THE CHALLENGERS WAS TO COME UP WITH

113
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,755
CHALLENGERS WAS TO COME UP WITH A TEST THAT THE JUSTICES COULD

114
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:17,255
A TEST THAT THE JUSTICES COULD APPLY.

115
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,924
APPLY. WELL, IT’S OBVIOUS THAT THEY

116
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:21,726
WELL, IT’S OBVIOUS THAT THEY DIDN’T FIND A TEST THAT A

117
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:22,861
DIDN’T FIND A TEST THAT A MAJORITY OF THE JUSTICES ARE

118
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:23,895
MAJORITY OF THE JUSTICES ARE COMFORTABLE WITH.

119
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,567
COMFORTABLE WITH. NOW, IN THE WISCONSIN CASE, THE

120
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,868
NOW, IN THE WISCONSIN CASE, THE DISSENTERS SAY -- SUGGEST SOME

121
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,771
DISSENTERS SAY -- SUGGEST SOME IDEAS THAT COULD BE USED IN THE

122
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:33,105
IDEAS THAT COULD BE USED IN THE FUTURE.

123
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:35,173
FUTURE. BUT FOR NOW, THE SUPREME COURT

124
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,542
BUT FOR NOW, THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT GOING TO ENGAGE ON THIS

125
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:45,484
IS NOT GOING TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE OF HEART SANPARTISAN GERRY

126
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:49,154
ISSUE OF HEART SANPARTISAN GERRY AND FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS

127
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:50,856
AND FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS STATE LEGISLATURES WILL BE FREE

128
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,090
STATE LEGISLATURES WILL BE FREE IN HOW THEY DRAW THE LINES.

129
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:53,392
IN HOW THEY DRAW THE LINES. >> PETE, QUICKLY BEFORE I LET
