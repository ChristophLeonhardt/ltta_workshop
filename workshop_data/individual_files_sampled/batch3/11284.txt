hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle the Russians are coming the Russians are coming for well over the last year and a half this is the message Western audiences have been served up 24/7 what is behind this hysteria what does this message aim to achieve how is Russia supposed to react importantly are we facing a possible conflict crosstalking anti-russia hysteria I'm joined by maggots Lord Richard Balfe in London he is a member of the UK House of Lords in Paris we have John Lachlan he is a historian specialist in international affairs and in Washington we cross the leaf Stranahan he is an investigative journalist as well as co-host of fault lines on radio Sputnik alright gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in any time you want then I always appreciate let me go to John Lachlan in Paris first John what do you make of this because when a hysterical environment like we see in the United States and the UK and now spreading through Europe there's no words of reason that can be spoken no dialogue is allowed whatsoever and if you question and if we look at the case in point of this poisoning alleged poisoning incident in the UK in Salisbury you know I see no evidence whatsoever being provided I've been asked by Western media outlets to talk about it and I say talk about what there's nothing to talk about and until there's some evidence can I see some pictures of the guy and his daughter in a hospital give me something no just take our word for it and that's essentially what the Americans said kicking out so many diplomats at historical level we just take the word of our UK colleagues that is not rational go ahead John yeah well I mean there are two things that are very frightening about this whole business one is obviously the geopolitical aspect but yes as you say in your question Peter the other is the what is what it says about the internal political climate both within Britain and in the Allied states I mean you say there's been no evidence that's true but what I think is even worse is the the explanations that are given by the British government are completely incoherent you know the Foreign Office is making fun of Russia saying it's offered 30 different explanations but Boris Johnson says mutually in catapult incompatible things in the same sentence for example when he appeared in front of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee he said that the script holes had been attacked with a chemical weapon so that Russia would leave a fingerprint or a footprint on this attack so everyone would know who it was to intimidate other future traitors and then in the next sentence he said that the Novacek tact had revealed a secret weapons program which Russia had hidden from the international community and from the relevant statutory bodies well these two statements cannot both be true either Russia wanted to advertise this as a murder knowing it would be traced back to Russia or Russia was trying to keep it secret but one of the two of them cannot be true at the same time and indeed on on Thursday we heard that the police say that the poison was somehow administered through the front door of their house in Wow in Wiltshire well well yeah but I mean you've been attacked by a chemical weapon you decide to go to a cemetery then you go for a beer then you go for a lunch an Italian restaurant it takes four hours for the chemical weapon to act I don't call that military-grade I don't think that would work very well on the battlefield do you it's amazing let me go to Laura Laura Lord Richard in London I mean it seems to me that this this hysteria is that being conjured up in jinda because of domestic issues in the US and in the UK we have we see massive political changes going on in Europe NATO countries are by the way this is a very interesting way to kind of keep the alliance cohesive because it is fraying okay go ahead in London well it's fraying that the whole of the this story just doesn't hang together I mean we are asked to believe that a member of the Russian Secret Service went to will cheer on a Sunday in the middle of the day and sprayed some poison on a doorknob I mean come off it originally we were told she brought it in with her luggage you know and yet it's so dangerous it spreads all over the place I mean what did she bring her luggage in a lead-lined wheelie bin or something I mean no pictures of the people in hospital hey I mean it has certain overtones of a Russian internal dispute between the Russian community in London it's difficult to stretch it any further but also when the litvenko case was on there are all sorts of big from the hospital we've seen nothing why what's going on here you know Lila McCoy because the police who are involved in it will cheer police the most incompetent police force in Britain that tried to frame X Prime Minister Edward Heath I wouldn't trust them to look for my cat if it was missing let alone anything bigger you know one of the questions I asked in my introduction is that what does Washington and London expect Russia to do if there is no evidence provided proving guilt the Russians are cutting this left kind of the wilderness he won't share the evidence but you're going down this path of expulsion 'he's with other things being threatened in the future I mean what you know from the Russian point of view you know how are they supposed to react to this kind of hysteria it's like dealing with an ANA lesson go ahead Lee well I'll tell you I let me take a slightly contrary position I actually don't think this is exactly about domestic policy I think this is about covering up in particular u.s. foreign policy disasters specifically in Syria and Ukraine let me let me say this Ukraine for instance we see that NATO has already come out and said well we're expelling diplomats it's the poisonings part of it but also annex in Crimea etc etc right they don't want people to know that what happened in Crimea came right after the u.s. fomented a coup in Ukraine which and this is the other thing it's not being reporting the media but anybody can look it up it's not working out well poroshenko who the u.s. back in Ukraine is not very popular in fact his favorable rating is not only below trumps it's below Hillary Clinton's he's about a 6% utin favorable rating in Syria right now were 70 days or so into this Afrin disaster where we have one US ally turkey working with another u.s. al al the free Syria Army to attack a different US ally the Kurds it's a complete ruin and so I have been worried about this ever since I well you know what I was just gonna say I went to Lebanon you know it is 2013 I saw this for myself I think I think that you're onto something here but I think that it's really you know the so-called Russia threat and this hysteria that is created it's really one size fits all I mean it does serve the purpose of I'm going to John here now in Paris it does serve the purpose of masking failures because everything is a failure now when it comes to foreign policy one right after another okay in this particular case Russia was invited into Syria so that's why they can pin something on on Russia but I still think I strongly believe that is a lot of it is domestically driven and Russia is a good punching bag it's the good old favored bogeyman you even hear people in the US National Security Council and the Pentagon saying those things in public thank goodness things are getting back to normal go ahead John yeah I do think there's a geopolitical angle firstly there's no doubt that since the Ukraine revolution since the annexation of Crimea or the the reintegration of Crimea and of course since the intervention in Syria Russia has started to fight back let's not forget that the Americans under volfovich in 1992 said that they wanted full spectrum dominance and Russia has started to read read to Ritter address very slightly the geopolitical balance and I do believe that that is one of the aggravating factors but I also think that the aggravating factors in this Russian hysteria but I also think there's a very specific reason to this specific script bail case which goes beyond the Syrian and Crimean cases and that is that Britain has a particular need within the context of the brexit negotiations yes Teresa may when she became prime minister said she wanted a full free trade agreement with the European Union I believe that was a major strategic error on her part because it put her in the position of someone who wanted something from Brussels yep because she wants something from Brussels she has to give something in return and what Britain can offer in return is military power and the secret services in other words the British have a clear motive for trying to show the Europeans that the Europeans need them they need their protection they need their security services and they need their armies and we can see this in all kinds of areas not just in this crippled case we see it for example also in the fact that the British Commissioner now in Brussels is the Commissioner for the security union he's a former ambassador who's worked on security issues all his life and the British in other words have been given the role if you like of creating for themselves and for the European Union in the future a security role in which Britain once brexit has happened will continue to play and and will continue to way so that's my view about the geopolitical imperative behind this particular case against a background of much bigger geopolitical rivalry with Russia over many years Richard Melvyn I think it's really interesting how the British prime minister is used this issue because she's been very vocal on it you know she was right out of the gate when this happened here and I agree with John Lachlan that this is has a lot to do with the difficulties that brexit what kind of relationship the UK is going to happen have with the with the European Union it plays very well go ahead in London well the first reality of course is that if you leave a club you'll never as well off as if you're in a club and there's no way that Britain is going to be better off outside the European Union than it is inside it so that's point one yes of course Britain has a security role that so has France France has is an independent nuclear power Britain is not Britain is a u.s. dependent nuclear power I think there's something in this but scruple does not make sense he'd been here for 12 years if he hadn't been debriefed I can't believe he was any use as an security asset so why they've chosen him I still go back to my favorite theory which is that it was an internal Russian emigre spat and we still haven't got to the bottom of where his connections were things have leaked out about he was friends this person used to go to a Russian shop in Waterloo and God knows well I think he was more closely involved in the Russian community than we've been told okay and I wouldn't be surprised jump in here we're gonna go to a break and I definitely agree with you you know Britain is the god's playground for oligarchs and you know a lot of others unsavory characters that Britain let in we're gonna go to a break now after our break we'll continue our discussion on the anti Russia has stereo stay with RT welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter belt remind you were discussing anti-russia hysteria okay Lee as I said in my the introduction air we've been going we've been watching this thing unfold this rat hysteria this a fictional can real conspiracy theory conjured up by the political elites in the media where does it stop because it seems like it's taken on a life of its own it has a momentum of its own because when you look to connect dots in a conspiracy theory you can find a lot of dots because you you've left your senses okay you only see what you want to see and a lot of people are scoring political points on this journalist number one this is a this is a gravy train you can say whatever you want and you'll never be held accountable because there's no conspiracy behind it you don't understand how deep it all is this is what drives people insane and we have it on a societal level right now go ahead Lee in Washington well here's what I think is interesting about it you brought up the media and and that is a great point because that's the other thing that's going on here globally because of technology because everybody's got a cell phone everybody is internet access the media's grip on a monopoly on information about news and politics has changed and they are desperately worried about that I think and and again this is my view and you're never going to hear this from the media people aren't buying it what I've said is in a sense we're watching like the gulf of tonkin play out in real time remember the gulf of tonkin was what got the us into the vietnam war and years later we figured out that was a fake story people right now iced my sense is if you talked to people in America and you said are you buying this Russian narrative at least 30% or so are gonna be like no not at all not at all Prof possibly higher now they're never going to pull on that but what I'm saying is despite the fact that the media is beating the same drum every single day I don't think it's working with the American people because the fact is people are doing their own research into the middle it's what's important here Lee I can do agree with you okay but what is important is that the population there they're not polled and they're not asked to vote on what should be done about it that's left to the powers that be and they're very pliant media stenographers okay John let me go to you because like I said this has a momentum of its own and how do you back down how do you deescalate when you start making these horrific historical comparisons see I've been saying this for a half a year you can ratchet up but you don't know how to go down and then you get to a tipping point where it gets to a point of pride in hubris and that's when the worst decisions are made think of August 1914 go ahead John well history is littered with examples like this but I don't think they want to Ratchet it down they want to Ratchet it up even if it had been an attack committed by the Russian state which I don't for a minute except there would have there might have been other ways of dealing with it we know that the ultimatum was given and then the expulsion z' were announced by London before any evidence could possibly have been acquired because on the day before the expulsion z' were announced in the House of Commons by Mrs May the Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in charge of counterterrorism said the investigation was very complicated and would be going on for weeks or months so again you know we know that the police do not know how the poison got there so if the police don't know then how can the government know so we know that the goal is to Ratchet it up and the reason why it's to ratchet up is for the reason is the reason I gave earlier they need to secure the cohesion of the of the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union just as they did on mh17 you remember the Malaysian airliner shot down overall which crashed over Ukraine I went before coming on the program I went on to the website of the Dutch Authority which is supposed to be launching a criminal investigation into that in other words say who they think did it do you know when their last press conference was it was in September 2016 so in other words the inquiry has run into the sands yeah or for that matter Yushchenko you remember the ushanka poisoning that was another russian-backed poisoning in Ukraine in 2004 where do you think that inquiry went for five years when you Schenker was president of Ukraine and had the entire Ukrainian state apparatus at his disposal nowhere the fact is that these allegations are made they are milked for all they're worth politically and then they're forgotten about and I expect if you invite us on in a year or two about scribble will find the same thing has happened with him Lord Richard both weigh in on that because do you see more ratcheting I mean I I agree because we have a history of this but I mean how far can it go before there is a crisis point here okay I mean you had the lunatic nikki Haley you know I mean unbelievable you know I've always say that she has a PhD in hillbilly Studies and now she represents the United States at the UN okay I mean she said it could happen in New York City I mean talk about crisis mongering and in what I've seen unnoticed over the last year and a half it is preparing Western audiences for some kind of conflict go ahead in London well this is what worries me because I think we need to deescalate I mean we've gone on and on about the Crimea my solution is quite simple have a UN sponsored poll where as to whether they want to be in Russia I'm pretty sure I know the answer but we had a president we had one in Holland in 1950s so you know if we want to deescalate we could but de-escalation cannot be done with the president foreign secretary and defense secretary grandstanding around possibly Philip Hammond who was the last foreign secretary would be a much better choice because he's a bit calmer but we have to deescalate because if this carries on what are we going to do the British people I do not think will accept war and that's where it's leading to that's where all of this rhetoric is leading to and we've got to deescalate it for the sake of the continent let me go back to Lee and washing in the the Lord Richard mouth is absolutely right but it's not going to happen because of hubris okay this is this is the problem they've these the the authors of these narratives of these fake stories are painting them so have painted themselves into a corner because if you choose the path of de-escalation then that's called appeasement and that will not be allowed this is why this is a dangerous dead-end because even having a rational discussion about it means you're a Putin troll that's where we that's where we are unfortunately go ahead Lee well I'll tell you i-i've thought a lot about this obviously because look I work for Sputnik I work for Sputnik because I saw through this Russia thing I wouldn't work for Sputnik if I thought this all every demonization that I hear were true but I looked into it myself and I see what's going on I'm gonna tell you it's a radical suggestion I think it's gonna have to come from Russia and from Vladimir Putin in particular if Vladimir imagined this just imagine this what if Vladimir Putin started doing addresses to the West directly to the West five minutes on YouTube once a week here's my person right - here's what I think now they would go nuts the media would go nuts because the fact is they would try to do what they've done - Assange but you just shut him down but the fact is that would only make people want to listen more and I think I have no hope that this is going to happen from the web for the West it's kind of an interesting idea the Jon it'd be you know that's akin to a Trump on Twitter here knowing the style of Vladimir Putin I don't think that's something he would do but them Maria's a karva is playing that role right now and I think quite effectively John where is this all going where what is what the goal is what in the West is just have Russia's surrender its sovereignty and break itself up and allow neoliberalism - you know scour the the Russian economy I mean I I don't know what the goal is when did they say we've achieved what we wanted wait you know there's no goal set goal stop bad behavior I don't know what that means because I see the West involved in bad behavior all the time and no one is stopping them go ahead John well the fact is there is a big geopolitical battle I said earlier that Crimea and Ukraine represent geopolitical victories for Russia against a background of 20 years 25 years in which the West and the Americans in particular have wanted to have full spectrum dominance they in other words they've wanted to dominate all areas of military activity and to do so in a way that even a coalition of allies could not possibly threaten them and they've achieved that because the Americans have because as we know American military spending is equivalent to the spending of the seven next countries added up together I think to understand the current environment we have to look at a document that was produced the national security strategy document produced on January the 19th of this year by the by the American administration which changes the view of Russia and China from the previous Obama administration and says that Russia and China are now strategic rivals Obama had left open the possibility that there could be cooperation and Trump himself in spite of his occasional friendly words towards Russia has said that he wants to maintain this total full spectrum dominance and he doesn't want any country or coalition of countries to be able to threaten it and therefore that's the goal so that is the answer and you know if you ask me what I think the worst-case scenario is I'm afraid I have to say that you know Boris Johnson mentioned at the dinner the Guildhall dinner on Wednesday he said it was like crime and punishment I'm afraid it's war and peace trump has just appointed one of the craziest men in the world john bolton to be National Security Advisor whose answer to everything is war and preventive war if necessary these people are crazy I I would be tempted to say Trump is the only sane man in the white house but I'm afraid I don't even think that's true you know in other words I I think that they are spoiling for a fight okay well John let me ask you also I mean do you think that this is a concerted agenda could we expect another horrific story and other poisoning or something like that as we come up to the World Cup well who knows I mean these things come along every five minutes don't know these new accusations whether it's mh17 or ushanka or fake news or inve you know they just never stop so I think yes the World Cup is obviously going to be a moment which will be very uncomfortable for the West because it would show you know a pleasant a side of Russia Russia and that is something they want to avoid because if you compare Moscow to a lot of Western cities now Moscow looks better many thanks to my guests in London Paris and in Washington DC and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
