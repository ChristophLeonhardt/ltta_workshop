is the American Dream dead I remember the times when the American Dream was pretty universal a big house a white picket fence a dog a family vacation time and freedom the opportunity to do what you like build what you like and not be interfered with by the government well it all might have come to an end at least in the eyes of Americans anyway Trump's tax cuts have put more money in our pockets and unemployment rates are thankfully lower than they have been for a long time but it seems that what people want from their lives as an American and what they want from the American Dreams is vastly different to what it used to be new data from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance shows that American people want something simpler than we used to the data shows that 82% of respondents now say their American dream is to just have financial security for themselves and their family the data comes from a survey of more than 3,200 people taken between January and February 2018 the data did find that most people still want a house a classic part of the American Dream but a significant amount also said that their primary focus would be to achieve financial independence that typically means having enough money to not have to work interestingly the 33% of those surveyed said they believe that their dream is disappearing it's not because of the economy it's not because of Trump despite what the left might want you to think it's actually because they have too much debt Mike Fanning the chief of MassMutual us explained Americans believe financial security is at the core of the American dream but it is alarming that so many think is beyond their reach how sad is that 56% of respondents have credit card debt and many said that they simply didn't feel financially secure Americans have more than a trillion dollars of credit card debt so it seems like we really do have something to worry about but while Americans work there hardest to achieve their dreams illegal immigrants don't have to worry about a thing it may seem like a tired old talking point to some but let's be honest about this while Americans believe the American Dream is dying and their debt is too crippling how is it that American politicians mostly Democrats have decided we have the resources to cater for literally millions of illegal immigrants it wasn't that long ago that families could be supported with only one paycheck and purchasing a home was a possibility for a vast majority of families it wasn't so much an American dream as it was an American reality now adults are living with their parents for longer than ever were crippled by tons of student loan debt going to school doesn't mean you'll get a career anyway and the cost of it is higher than ever so what can we do how can we reestablish this American Dream and inspire people to want more than just financial security how can we inspire American people to dream big who want a bigger house a bigger family and more freedom we have to start by solving one of the biggest issues in American politics today immigration I hope that's next on Trump's agenda because once that can be fixed we can get to working on building an economy that works for the American people again America first is more than just a slogan it's a campaign to reestablish the definition of what being an American is all about if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
