the other top story tonight critics blasting Republican policies that they say suppress votes in top races this story drawing intense scrutiny all over the place because it's not in one or two states but more of a trend crackdowns that disparately impact minorities who tend to vote Democratic in Georgia early voting underway with Republican Brian Kemp leading Stacey Abrams by about two points but he's not just the candidate for governor he's using his post as Secretary of State to hold up tens of thousands of voter registrations 70% of them African American voters are in Texas where Ted Cruz debates better or tonight the state attorney general prosecuting about three dozen people on charges of voter fraud now that is more than the previous five years combined critics say it may intimidate many lawful voters and then there's a big story that my colleague Rachel Maddow has been reporting on Heidi Heitkamp fighting in a red state where Republicans should have a big edge anyway but where they are taking extreme measures that critics say would suppress the votes of Native Americans what they specifically were working to get rid of in that state was your ability to vote if your ID doesn't have a street address on Native Americans in North Dakota at double the rate of everybody else don't have street addresses on their IDs if the Republicans can turn off the Native American vote if they can end that they can run the table they don't have to worry about there being any US senators from the Democratic Party I am joined by Donna Brazile back at the table and Ari Berman a senior reporter for Mother Jones the author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and a journalist who's been tracking this for a long time before it was really in the national spotlight Donna when you look at this is this targeting black voters and minorities and Native Americans as you see there yes sadly this is the greatest animal democracy not only in Georgia the Persian of people in the state of Indiana the failure to process voter registration cards in miami-dade the failure to understand that some of the voter registration forms as you know today's the day Atlanta to register to vote in several states including Maryland where there's a important gubernatorial race yes this is systemic it has been going on for decades but it's getting worse everybody should vote but we should not have to not only protect people right to vote at the same time we're asking people to vote because it really sends a message that why bother hmm.well and in Georgia re you've seen this laid out in a way where if you were a Martian and you landed in America and you said wait the person in charge of the election and it's fairness is also running in it it makes no sense that's before you get to what Brian camp is accused of I want to play both candidates in that race both sides if you will of that story and then get your analysis let's take a look so the challenge is twofold one is that we know this is a flawed system that has a disproportionate effect on people of color but it also has the ability to erode trust in our system that's a smokescreen trying to hide her radical views those folks that are on the pending list all they have to do is go to the polls show their photo ID and they can vote again this is just a distraction well Georgia is really the epicenter of voter suppression right now re at every level I mean they were the first state to pass a voter ID law in 2005 so they're really kicked off this movement to make it harder to vote they have closed 214 polling places you have the second largest county in Georgia which just sued today for rejecting one in ten absentee ballots the disproportionate impact is enormous you have 14% of Asian Americans 8 percent of African Americans 4 percent of Hispanics are having ballots rejected compared to only 2.5 percent of whites then you have the Secretary of State who's also running for governors you mentioned blocking 53,000 people from registering to vote and it's a very confusing process now for them but this is bigger than Georgia 24 states have passed new restrictions on voting since the 2010 election we just got out of an election that was the first presidential election 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act because the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act where black turnout fell dramatically and instead of fixing that problem instead of trying to get black turnout up and Latino turnout up an Asian American turnout up and young turnout up we've done the opposite which is states from Georgia to Texas to North Dakota and Wisconsin are now making it harder to vote in an election that's gonna be razor-thin in places like Georgia you're saying what you're reporting is suppression efforts could actually make the margin absolutely you look at North Dakota which Rachel Maddow has been covering Heidi Heitkamp won her first election to the Senate by three thousand votes she got eighty percent support from Native Americans there now you have a voter ID law could that could disenfranchise 5,000 Native American voters 20% of whom don't have the right IDs because they wrote the law such a way for no reason to exclude tribal IDs from being accepted so that's one race alone but in Georgia and North Dakota in Florida and other key states suppression could make the difference in this election and states like Texas remember rachel has also been reporting on what's going on a prairie view and what worries me also is that hurricane Florence hurricane Michael dip impacted areas in both South Carolina North Carolina also in Florida and Georgia where the presense are in minority communities and will they be open will the voters in those areas be told where to go to vote well people often talk about where does Donald Trump get his slogans and his talking points and the answer is he plagiarizes them from other people from other Republicans so make America great again he's literally ronald reagan's reelection slogan it wasn't obscure it was literally the slogan right and so I don't recall Donald Trump in the 90s or the 2000s talking a lot about voter fraud he picked this up like so many other things because he learned what what the modern Republican Party is doing that take a look at Trump playing of this issue but they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths and voter fraud is all too common and then they criticize us for saying that oh that voter fraud you know these politicians are brutal they're brutal there is the issue of voter fraud is it amazing the way they say there's no voter fraud voter fraud is the new dog whistle it's the new welfare queen battle-ax and it's used as an excuse to then push policies that suppress the vote and you know who Donald Trump got it from he got it from Republican secretaries of state like Chris Kovac in Kansas like Brian Kemp in Georgia who are now running for govenor to be the chief officials in their state so this is really really serious these guys who gave Trump this massive lie are on the ballot in 2018 right and so a lot of this is what affects the turnout even though it's one step behind what people know I want you both to stay with me we want to broaden this out a little bit we're talking about disenfranchisement there's these other practices that are totally legal and have an impact consider this simple fact the u.s. is one of the only countries where Election Day is on a workday which means if you're a normal world full time working person maybe you have some kids it's very hard to get to the polls and companies now are stepping up where the US government hasn't we want to spotlight one the Blue Point Brewing Company actually has this effort to make Election Day a national holiday they've put the petition right on their cans of beer and they give their own workers a day off to broaden this conversation to class I want to bring in a co-founder of the Brewing Company behind this effort mark Burford thanks for being here thank you for having me you want to make sure it's easy for your employees to vote regardless who they vote for absolutely at Blue Point we believe you should be able to get to the polls we created a company-wide holiday we created the beer with the petition on it and we want people to be able to vote every day or every time and it is your view from from being a business owner or some would call it a job creator to old Romney quote as a job creator and a business owner that this is something that working people that your employees were having a harder time doing well yeah I mean I know personally my parents must work full time they commuted four hours a day to work and they made to the polls every time but it wasn't easy it should never be that hard to vote you should be able to vote election day should be a national holiday it will help the country what do you think about this donut because you know so often we're in we're in the nitty-gritty of it you take a step back and remember when you do foam baking you call people and some of them say yeah I would want to vote I got the kind of job and the kind of childcare in the kind of situation where I can't get an hour out first of all I'm getting a six-pack I'm not if my name is Donna I'm getting a sixth round but election season as you well know begins now people are voting airily they're voting in there they're able to vote on weekends but in many states they're now restricting that because of the great turnout efforts we've had I remember a couple years ago we were celebrating the fact that you can vote on Sunday you can go to church and then we call it all souls to the polls they're trying to get rid of that this is a great idea but we also need a constitutional amendment to vote we have 50 states with 50 different rules and regulations and that's why voting has become so difficult in this I want to get into something that you know sometimes when you want to make plans with someone and they don't want to hang out with you they just claim they're too busy so it doesn't always mean everything happen with but when you look at this the the polling not about who you vote for but whether you vote at all shows this this is Pew Research Center from last year one of the seven Americans 14 percent we could put this up say they were basically too busy to vote yeah in 2016 14 percent that also is a margin I think that's true and you know the whole concept of election day is totally antiquated the reason why we vote in a Tuesday in November is because that's when farmers used to bring their crops to the market in the 1800s so I think every state not only should have voting be a national holiday but we should have two weeks of early voting minimum I think in every state in the country we should be able to have it get you could get an absentee ballot anywhere you live we should have election day voter registration so that people miss a registration deadlines in all of these states they can still show up at the polls and register to vote if we did all of that if we had early voting election day registration a national holiday so everyone could vote we would have much higher voter turnout than we have it it's fasting it's a story you've been reporting in a lot you know it from the inside and you're a different kind of voice here coming out of a company trying to make time for your own employees which we wanted to spotlight for a second because it's pretty interesting my thanks to Donna Ari and mark hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
