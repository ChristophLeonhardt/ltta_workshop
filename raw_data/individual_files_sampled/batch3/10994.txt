it's nearly a month on from the attack on former double agent Sergei scruple and his daughter in the town of Salisbury in southern England and Moscow says this position is being ignored as inquiries into the case remain unanswered by the UK Russia's foreign ministry has now published another set of questions this time directed to the International chemical non-proliferation proliferation body the OPCW author david swanson says that despite information being scarce the media has already delivered its verdict well it's not a judicial procedure this is not something brought to arbitration this is not the World Court this is an accusation through the media and so Russia is not being told very much and the public is not being told very much and of course that makes many of us skeptical but we just can't know whether the accusations are are true or not until were shown some evidence some Western leaders are also claiming that the whole world is on their side against Russia well it's patience is rather wearing thin with President Putin and his actions we stand with our British allies and the rest of the civilized world it has become clear that Russia's behind this effort to kill innocent civilians with a banned nerve agent so let's take a look at some of the countries that have voiced solidarity with the UK over the poisoning it does seem that the support only stretches as far as the NATO bloc and not even all of them we discussed this with david swanson as well well i think they think of themselves as the world the the international community which is always just a handful of nations that calls itself bats but you know in the United States here we've become very used to baseless accusations against Russia and so some of us are very skeptical regardless of the position taken by our government we can't know whether an accusation is true or not until they show us some evidence and rather than showing us some evidence they're working on expelling diplomats and pressuring other countries to expel diplomats which seems like a way to cut off communications I mean diplomats jobs are to interact when there are disagreements and if you get rid of them you're talking about you know not having communications other than by means of of military force
