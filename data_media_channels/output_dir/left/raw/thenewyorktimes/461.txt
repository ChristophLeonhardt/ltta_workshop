1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,901
“I don’t think there’s ever been
a president

2
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,470
who in this short period of time

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,505
has done what we’ve done.

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,709
January 20, 2017

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:14,447
This American carnage stops
right now.”

6
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,516
“This was the largest audience
to ever witness

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,585
an inauguration period.”

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,720
“Sean Spicer gave alternative
facts.”

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,423
“Withdrawal from the Trans-
Pacific Partnership.

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,925
Federal government employee
hiring freeze.”

11
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,460
“Except for the military.”

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,663
“Immigration is a privilege,
not a right.

13
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:31,898
And it’s not a Muslim ban.”

14
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,866
“This is not a Muslim ban.”

15
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,167
“It’s by nature not a ban.”

16
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,102
“And I am following through
on my promise

17
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,204
to appoint only the very best

18
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,240
and the very brightest.”

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,242
We’re also a team.

20
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,344
It’s a great team. It’s a team
that gets along.”

21
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,645
“Does he have the full
confidence

22
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:46,713
of the president?
Yes, he does.”

23
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,349
“General Flynn had misled the
vice president.”

24
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,484
“And I think the president made
the right decision

25
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,819
to ask for his resignation.”

26
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,854
“And the leaks are absolutely
real.

27
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,122
The news is fake.”

28
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,957
“The F.B.I. is investigating

29
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,427
the Russian government’s efforts
to interfere

30
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,029
in the 2016 presidential
election.”

31
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,299
“And my staff recommended
recusal.”

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,967
“With respect to the chairman’s
decision 

33
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,637
to step aside from the Russia
investigation ...”

34
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,373
“... and microwaves that turn
into cameras, etc.”

35
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,574
“You know when I say
‘wiretap,’

36
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,742
those words were in quotes.

37
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,843
That’s a very important thing.

38
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,078
But we said nothing.”

39
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,279
“I will administer justice

40
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,014
without respect to persons ...”

41
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,015
“Congratulations.”

42
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,884
“Strong hands.”

43
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,321
“You want the handshake?”

44
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,926
“The NATO alliance, I said it
was obsolete.

45
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,661
It’s no longer obsolete.”

46
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,463
“A life is lost, I don’t believe

47
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,064
that you can call it a success.”

48
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,199
”According to General Mattis,

49
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,567
it was a very successful
mission.

50
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,668
It’s already happened

51
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,504
that my attitude toward Syria
and Assad

52
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,239
has changed very much.

53
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,475
Everybody knows exactly what
happened, so

54
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,910
really another successful job.

55
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,613
The veterans have poured out
their sweat and

56
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,515
blood and tears, and it’s time

57
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,117
that we take care of them
properly.”

58
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,618
“Obamacare is the law of the
land.”

59
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,187
“Nobody knew that health care
could be so complicated.”

60
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,823
“But you’re gonna get a health
care vote next week?”

61
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,458
“Don’t know. Doesn’t matter
if it’s next week.

62
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,626
Next week doesn’t matter.

63
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,261
There is sort of this artificial
number

64
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:08,995
that gets thrown out.

65
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,463
It’s been a hugely successful

66
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,464
first hundred days.

67
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,832
The wall’s gonna get built,
folks.

68
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,367
Just in case anybody has any
questions.

69
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,603
Sometimes I look at some of the
things I'm signing

70
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,004
and I say ‘Maybe people won’t
like it,

71
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,473
but I’m doing the right thing.’

72
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,642
And no regular politician’s
gonna do —

73
00:02:22,642 --> 00:00:00,000
I don’t know if you folks
would do ...”
