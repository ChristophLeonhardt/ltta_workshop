can't wait to get home and try these

really happy to be wearing them or
they're just going insane working in the
small more store I don't know hey how
many tank tops are they we like limited
on these or what okay all right so we're
just doing this as a trial run so
they're on the site now I think what is
a hundred of each size roughly yeah but
there'll be a weight you can't order if
it says sold out you won't be out order
so there's probably a hundred of each
size I think so yeah that's it
