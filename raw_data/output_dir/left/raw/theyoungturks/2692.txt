1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,770
THE FOX NEWS WAR ON THE WORKING
CLASS CONTINUES, AGAIN

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,100
TARGETING WAITERS.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,830
THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING AGAINST
WAITERS THERE BUT THEY HAVE

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,059
A CEO ON FOX AND FRIENDS HE WAS
GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,890
ENTITLED HIS SERVANTS HAVE
BECOME.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,240
LET'S WATCH.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,990
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FORCES
YOU TO DO IT, WHAT HAPPENS?

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,980
THEY THINK YOU ARE GOING TO
PASS IT RIGHT ON TO THE

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,859
CONSUMER, BUT IF I TRY TO RAISE
PRICES, I AM DOING LESS GAS

10
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,109
AND THEY ARE GETTING INSULTED
AND THEY'RE NOT COMING.

11
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,909
THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED AND THEY
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

12
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:29,909
HAPPENING.

13
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:31,439
IF THEY ARE COMING, NOBODY IS
GETTING PAID.

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,400
I DO LESS BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO
REACT SO I HAD BUS WAS BEFORE.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,260
I CUT THEM TWO YEARS AGO WHEN
THE MINIMUM WAGE WENT FROM

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,960
5 TO 750 SO I USED TO HAVE A
CAPTAIN AND A BUS BOY, NOW

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,820
I ONLY HAVE A CAPTAIN AND
WAITER.

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,010
THEY TO DO MORE WORK, BUT
IT'S HARD TO FIND THE GOOD

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,750
PEOPLE, RIGHT?

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,750
AND INDUSTRY, YES.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,900
TODAY IT IS ALWAYS HARDER.

22
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,920
THE WAY OF WEIGHT STOP IS
DIFFERENT DOUBT THEY USED

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,260
TO BE SERVANTS WHEN I FIRST
OPENED YEARS AGO, HE WAS A

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,440
GREAT PRIDE IN BEING A SERVANT.

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,589
TODAY THEY HAVE A MORE SENSE OF
ENTITLEMENT BUT I AM BUILDING

26
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,079
PEOPLE, YOUNGER PEOPLE JUST NEED
Ã± THEY'RE NOT USED TO WORKING.

27
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,999
THEY ARE STARTING LATER.

28
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,079
THEY ARE GOING TO SCHOOL AND
THEN THEY DON'T WANT A WORK.

29
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,969
THAT'S LESS THAN WE WANT OUR

30
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,789
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE YOU
MEET SOMEONE WHO IS 23

31
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,960
YEARS OLD AND THEY NEVER REALLY
HAD A JOB.

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,759
MAN, BY THE TIME I WAS 23
I CAN'T SAY HOW MANY JOBS I

33
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,819
HAD INCLUDING AN FOOD-SERVICE SO
THAT WAS WONDERFUL, I WOULD

34
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,829
LIKE TO APPLAUD HIM FOR HIS
CHOICE OF WORDS.

35
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,649
THEY USED TO BE PROUD TO BE MY
SERVANTS BUT NOW THEY WANT

36
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,520
TO GO TO SCHOOL IN ASPIRE TO
SOMETHING ELSE.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,479
I THOUGHT IT WAS HYPERBOLE
WHEN I FIRST SAW THE HEADLINE.

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,450
NO, HE LITERALLY SAID THEY USED
TO BE SERVANTS.

39
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,840
THAT IS A QUOTE.

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,170
NOW THEY ARE GOING TO SCHOOL AND
THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK.

41
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,639
NO, GOING TO SCHOOL SO THEY CAN
HAVE A BETTER JOB LATER SO

42
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,600
THEY DON'T SPEND THE REST OF
THEIR LIFE BEING YOUR

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,719
SERVANT AND HE IS LIKE WHAT KIND
OF WORK ETHIC IS THIS WHEN

44
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,340
YOU GO TO SCHOOL INSTEAD OF
WORKING FOR ME AND LOOK,

45
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,929
I'M FROM NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK
AND NEW JERSEY ORIGINALLY

46
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:03,991
SO MAYBE A GLASS HOUSE AS THE
VIEWER SAID YESTERDAY MY

47
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,591
PRONUNCIATION OF BRICK IN BUT
THERE IS SOMETHING A NEWS

48
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:11,560
AMUSING WHEN THIS GUY SAYS THEY
ARE NOT EDUCATED ANYMORE.

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,110
OKAY, I ASSUME HE HAD SOME
EDUCATION AND HAS DONE WELL

50
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,840
IN HIS RESTAURANTS, BUT IF YOU
ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,810
EDUCATED OR HAD THOUGHT IT
THROUGH A LITTLE BIT MORE,

52
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,712
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO GO ON
NATIONAL TV CLAIMING ABOUT

53
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:25,410
COMPLAINING ABOUT YOUR SERVANT'S
DIET DOESN'T PLAY WELL.

54
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,390
IF YOU JUST TALK TO HEY, WHEN
YOU INCREASE THEM IN A

55
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,720
WAGE, IF ANYONE COULD MUSTER AN
INTELLIGENT ARGUMENT ON FOX

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,140
AND FRIENDS, THAT WOULD BE
AMAZING AND UNPRECEDENTED

57
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,900
BUT HE COULD'VE SAID LOOK, WHEN
YOU RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE,

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,990
THERE SOME CONSEQUENCES.

59
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,860
YES, ONE OF THEM, PEOPLE GET
PAID BETTER AND I'M HAPPY

60
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,980
ABOUT THAT.

61
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,450
AT LEAST HAD THE DECENCY TO LIE
ABOUT IT.

62
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,450
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'M
UNHAPPY ABOUT IS THAT I

63
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,120
LOSE SOME OF MY BUSBOYS AND I
HAVE TO DO THAT CALCULATION

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
AND THAT IS TOUGH.

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,860
YOU COULD'VE MADE THAT
ARGUMENTATIVE COMING OUT THERE

66
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,420
AND GOING THE PROBLEM IS MY
CUSTOMERS, THEY ARE UNEDUCATED

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,670
AND MY SERVANTS, THEY HAVE A JOB
WITH ME AND THEY ARE GOING

68
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,510
TO WORK, THEN WORKING VERY HARD.

69
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,510
YOU SHOWED THE STAFF.

70
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,200
WE ARE NOT BEING PAID FOR HOW
HARD WE ARE WORKING AND

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,150
THAT IS ACROSS BASICALLY ALL
FIELDS IN THIS COUNTRY.

72
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,260
HE IS THE ENTITLED ONE.

73
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,260
HE THINKS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT
HAVE AN EDUCATION AND NOT

74
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,400
LIVE ON THE STREETS THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM.

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM.

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,540
I KNOW I WORKED AS A WAITER.

77
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,490
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO THEY ARE 50 OR
60 YEARS OLD AND STILL WORK

78
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,310
AS WAITERS THAT SOME PEOPLE
CHOOSE TO DO THAT BUT THE

79
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,210
IDEA THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO DO
THAT TAKE PERSONAL PRIDE IN

80
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,410
THAT NEVER ASPIRED ANYTHING ELSE
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS AND I

81
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,940
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
OF THE WHOLE ENTITLED THING,

82
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,560
THE SERVANT TALK BUT THEN JR DID
A LITTLE BIT OF DIGGING, SO I

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,980
DID SOME DIGGING ON THE SKY AND
FOUND THAT HE IS JUST INTERESTED

84
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,600
NOW BECAUSE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE
ALTHOUGH HE WAS IN 2015 TALKING

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,830
ABOUT HOW LABOR REGULATIONS ARE
SHUTTING DOWN RESTAURANTS

86
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,210
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THIS IS A
GUY WHO WAS AN ACTIVIST ON THAT.

87
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,120
HE IS AN ANTI-LABOR ACTIVISM
IT IS WHAT HE DOES BUT JR

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,450
FOUND SOMETHING AND FROM
EARLIER IN HIS LIFE THAT MAY BE

89
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,700
INTERESTING AND MAY SPEAK TO HIS
WORK ETHIC.

90
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:30,540
HIS NAME IS WILLIAM JACK DEGEL.

91
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,200
HE DOES HAVE WORK AS A SNITCH.

92
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,510
I PERSONALLY THINK COOPERATING
WITH ONE FIRST MINUTES FIND

93
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,970
BETTER KNOW ABOUT HIS WORK ETHIC
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO STILL

94
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,060
MONEY BY COMMITTING FRAUD.

95
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
WEIRD.

96
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,410
AND THEN YOU SEE THAT GUY AND
YOU SEE HIS ATTITUDE

97
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,530
TOWARDS HIS WORKERS, YOU SEE THE
FACT THAT HE IS COMMITTED

98
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,161
FRAUD IN THE PAST AND ANY THINK
ABOUT A RECENT CHANGE TO

99
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,280
THE LAW AND THE TAX BILL WHERE
DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING IT

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,530
SO THAT TIPS ARE THE LEGAL
PROPERTY OF MANAGERS AND

101
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,310
OWNERS OF RESTAURANTS AND WE
HAVE TO JUST HOPE THAT IN

102
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,410
THEIR BENEFITS SINCE THEY WILL
ACTUALLY PASS ON THE TIPS

103
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,840
TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED AND
EARNED THEN, REGULAR AMERICANS.

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,960
ARE YOU GOING TO TRUST THAT
GUIDING HAND OUT THE TIPS?

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,770
I WOULD NOT.

106
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,400
LET'S KNOW FOR THE RECORD, HE
SAID THE PROBLEM WITH THE YOUNG

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,390
IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK
HARD GOT TO BE FAIR TO HIM, HE

108
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,120
WAS RELATIVELY YOUNG AT THE AGE
OF 27 WHEN HE DID NOT WANT TO

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,030
WORK HARD AND WANTED TO DO
CREDIT CARD FRAUD INSTEAD.

110
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,061
THE ANNOYING PART OF THIS WHOLE
STORY IS WEIRD NOT GOING

111
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:27,950
HAVE TO CHANGE THE SAYING FROM
SNITCHES GET

112
00:05:27,950 --> 00:00:00,000
STITCHES TO SNITCHES GET
RESTAURANTS.
