1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
so a lot of you have asked me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what on</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,440
earth is space cap and the truth is I

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,330
don't really know I'm so kind of

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,490
defining it and making me as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go along</font>

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,170
I knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i vanish progress that I</font>

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,910
would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a daily vlogging or</font>

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,830
mostly daily vlogging project again the

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">near future it's made of creation</font>

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,680
production that really works for me

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,210
especially while I'm doing a lot of

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,920
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things at my day job because it</font>

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,779
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I stopped worrying and</font>

13
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,850
agonizing about making something it

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,650
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped holding onto</font>

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,699
footage and not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen stuff I don't</font>

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,070
know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it still quite know what the</font>

17
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,079
block is there it makes me put something

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,930
up I suppose it provides a certain

19
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,719
structure and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain level of as you</font>

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,790
know expectation that makes me make

21
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,559
something that's really helpful to me

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really exciting to me somehow but</font>

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,079
yeah I think that it kind of gave the

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect time because I spent all this</font>

25
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,890
time in london in january i filmed a lot

26
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,420
of things some stuff i still have an

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">english annual talked about and I was</font>

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,870
also really a lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

29
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,879
could take the tube again so I was just

30
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,039
constantly taking on board a lot of

31
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,799
ideas but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was so easy</font>

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,890
just become sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of passive and receptor</font>

33
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to create</font>

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,310
things in response because otherwise for

35
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,260
me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like half of the respiratory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

36
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,689
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say that word respiratory</font>

37
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:18,090
respiratory respiratory cycle probably

38
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,590
breathing it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard for the</font>

39
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,240
breathing cycle it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like you</font>

40
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
take your deep breath in but you can't

41
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,299
take the breath out you can't make that

42
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,040
conversion I have to make something

43
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,650
response to what I'm taking you on

44
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,689
because that's how I process it that's

45
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,310
how I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember it in a way by making</font>

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,960
something different with it and that's

47
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,390
not unique by any means I think we all

48
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to some extent but for me the</font>

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,439
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do that is through here and</font>

50
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,040
I also think it's a helpful way for me

51
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,630
while I'm living in a new place and

52
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,490
coming to town to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new place and</font>

53
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,960
finally the things I absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,939
about a new place but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> having in</font>

55
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,329
some ways a sort of retreat by living

56
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,960
here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like my life isn't as</font>

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,210
intensely social because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

58
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge network of people who I've</font>

59
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,469
known for many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are meeting</font>

60
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,390
all the time all these sorts of like

61
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,570
book events and so on

62
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,699
and it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have like a slightly</font>

63
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,500
different focus while I'm here and it's

64
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,300
helpful for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep the wheels</font>

65
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,430
running and keep making something but

66
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,690
the reason why i call that space camp

67
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,360
was because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have this</font>

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,300
really big situation where the names

69
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,610
would give periods of time and put aside

70
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,280
I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially associated with</font>

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,890
diet and lifestyle changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 30 days</font>

72
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">shreds and things like that for me that</font>

73
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,310
are associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of dread</font>

74
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,980
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are certain expectation I</font>

75
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,430
put on myself and it's very pass fail

76
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,280
it's very limited to self judgment and

77
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,410
some sort of identity connection there

78
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,690
so I've started giving projects that

79
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,730
aren't rigidly time-based but there are

80
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,890
you a new thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try out</font>

81
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,110
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> star just give them kind of fun</font>

82
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,630
names I started this new exercise

83
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,640
regimen that isn't you know planned in

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
any way<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form other than it's</font>

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,330
like try and do yoga and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

86
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,580
more you don't see how it goes it was

87
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,590
the extent of the regiment I call this

88
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">face count because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it'd be fun</font>

89
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love space and I think that that</font>

90
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,410
adds an element of structure to it

91
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,360
without necessarily being overwhelming

92
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,220
but then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to incorporate other</font>

93
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,100
things into it I started to incorporate

94
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,150
different approaches to what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

95
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,060
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> I starting to incorporate my</font>

96
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,500
resolutions and general goals this year

97
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,810
I said to incorporate the kinds of

98
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,340
things that I was making<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my free time</font>

99
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,299
videos included and so these this came

100
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:35,769
became part of spacecraft they're

101
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,269
speaking part of this thing the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

102
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,739
started to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it the more it</font>

103
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,329
started to resonate for me because I

104
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,560
think that space<font color="#E5E5E5"> count and all that I've</font>

105
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever been to space camp but my</font>

106
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,900
understanding of it is that it's

107
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,670
preparing your whole being your whole

108
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,070
body and<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain included and your whole</font>

109
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,410
body for being in a different

110
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment in which your body is going</font>

111
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to react in a different particular way</font>

112
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,180
it's a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't entirely</font>

113
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,519
understand and all we can do is prepare

114
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,130
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and that's something about</font>

115
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,470
preparation but in the meantime<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

116
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,380
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of nourish you and</font>

117
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,549
strengthen you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

118
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,150
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea that it's this big vast</font>

119
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,440
sometimes terrifying if you think about

120
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,048
it too much but but generally vast and

121
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,108
awesome

122
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:20,000
traditional sense of all it's this whole

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,228
experience that you're preparing

124
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,060
yourself for and while you're preparing

125
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,060
for it you're also participating in it

126
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,370
that makes sense I don't know if it's

127
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,419
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those things that I loved</font>

128
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,409
and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been thinking a lot about</font>

129
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,710
space and I have this great<font color="#E5E5E5"> cap from the</font>

130
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,389
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you may like the way to Mars I</font>

131
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,830
got stuck on Mars and then how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat</font>

132
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,960
potatoes whole time like they gave me a

133
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,909
cat afterwards so that's a lot of voice

134
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,620
base camp<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's happened and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

135
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I do i do put a start date your men</font>

136
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,030
date when it have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a creative way</font>

137
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,580
for me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make videos maybe i will make</font>

138
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,439
videos under the guise of space camp for

139
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest of my life maybe i'll make</font>

140
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,710
videos on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys with Space Camp two</font>

141
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,990
days more and be done I think I do think

142
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,400
like me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just start calling you all</font>

143
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
astronauts maybe that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be my bed</font>

144
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,219
lovers to any weight in there to call it

145
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,509
a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I need to edit this and</font>

146
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,189
it's already late and it's a school day
