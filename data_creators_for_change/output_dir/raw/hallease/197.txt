2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,260

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,539
they looking kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rugged starting to</font>

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,180
show their age not<font color="#E5E5E5"> cute so what I do is</font>

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">I usually redo the front and that makes</font>

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,599
them just look better overall and lets

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">me keep them in for another two weeks so</font>

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going to show you how I do that and</font>

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,520
if you're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about getting havana</font>

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,809
twist this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a great way for you</font>

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,460
to just see the process of installing

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,649
them and how it's totally easy to do it

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see i'm</font>

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,170
sectioning off the front of all the

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,379
twists that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to redo and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,910
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the rest of them behind</font>

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,430
me so that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do them and then</font>

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,320
also just so i can like a voyage stray

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,690
hairs and here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start on</font>

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,379
my side and take this one havana twists

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,000
apart remember if you're taking them

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,949
apart for those of you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

23
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,140
have them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think of my Ganga be careful</font>

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,309
once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your hair as you can</font>

25
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,680
seem about to hit my hair and just be

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,479
gentle with how you take them out I mean

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,560
I'm moving through it pretty quickly

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,409
because when i install them I detangle

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,330
heavily so anyway it is my hair I'm kind

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,040
of finger detangling a little bit just

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there aren't any major</font>

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,640
knots and then i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use aloe</font>

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,479
vera gel to smooth my edges down and

34
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,119
this is me not knowing how to focus on

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,070
my own camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> I swear I went to film</font>

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,740
school I<font color="#E5E5E5"> swear so yeah we're going to</font>

37
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,840
take some and just kind of rub it on the

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,970
edges<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my hair using their focusing</font>

39
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,850
again because I don't know I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

40
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,560
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go just rubbing it along shaft</font>

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,869
of my hair as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting on the edges</font>

42
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,640
and the ends and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then also work and get</font>

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,470
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my scalp because i don't know i</font>

44
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,610
just put on my scalp and it feels good

45
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,189
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do it I'm sure there's probably so</font>

46
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,869
there's some like some cosmetic issues

47
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:58,620
that help

48
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,160
that whatever I like aloe vera gel I'm

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,600
sure it's good for you probably can't

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,680
hurt take the hair that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just took out</font>

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,190
half it like so and then I part the

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,000
section into you lay the hair in between

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,580
the two sections<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're going to</font>

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">twist one section this on this instance</font>

55
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm going counterclockwise you can do

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,600
clockwise and then make sure you twist

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,910
the other section the same direction

58
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you twitch to first you need to</font>

59
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,680
make sure both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are twisted in</font>

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same direction and then twist those</font>

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,470
together in the opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> directions that</font>

62
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,940
you've posted that if that makes sense

63
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,730
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I do at the ends I like since</font>

64
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,040
my hair is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> shorter I try to</font>

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">really infuse my hair into the havana</font>

66
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,000
twist hair so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i kind of wrap the</font>

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,320
synthetic hair around my real hair so

68
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,740
that the ends blend in better you can

69
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,300
see it's sometimes in technique couple

70
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,860
times like this time saving three times

71
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,480
just one more way it just wouldn't go in

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,650
and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make sure that it looks</font>

73
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,570
relatively seamless I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

74
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that looks perfect but relatively</font>

75
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,450
seamless I still get people i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

76
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,550
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all my hair and i think it's</font>

77
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,520
funny because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not i mean it's my</font>

78
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,830
hair because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i paid for it so i'm here</font>

79
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,410
to the paper and here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to me do</font>

80
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,640
one more time I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make sure</font>

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,260
y'all are getting it ignore the dandruff

82
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,750
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already put the aloe vera juice in</font>

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,840
twist one half this time doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,640
counterclockwise again four or five

85
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,620
times don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go crazy with it twist the</font>

86
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,820
other side same four or five times you

87
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,170
don't want to put too much tension on

88
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,420
your scalp then twist in the opposite

89
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,190
direction

90
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i'm twisting clockwise when i</font>

91
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,890
put them together and then again as i

92
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,050
get towards the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

93
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,910
my hair into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the synthetic hair and by</font>
