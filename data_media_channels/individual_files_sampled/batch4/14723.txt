vais says no one wants to date a conservative well I'm sure they're narrow-minded crackpot investigations squad did some solid journalism to figure this out so who is the more open-minded an attractive group well let's find out I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood the Weisse article goes in Harr with the bombastic clique provoking and virtue signaling title because let's be honest I think their audience skews a bit more left of Bernie the title reads quote conservatives are whining because no one wants to date them unquote whoa there drew Schwartz he's the writer of the article whoa that's a that's a headline I'm sure the male feminist clicking this well yeah conservatives are so dumb they're all in shape and confident and responsible people that you know never hook up with girls and all the feminists are like crybaby sexist not getting the action they think they're entitled to huh click well let's read on the very first sentence apparently it's not as easy to get laid in the Capitol if you're a Republican hmm that's a very small very specific data pull to pull from I'm sure that wouldn't skew the data let's just see the breakdown here from the Washington DC area Wow 90% vote for Hillary Clinton interesting I wonder what the study would have found out they looked at a maybe neutral area or any place conservative hmm because obviously they looked up actual stats right right let's keep reading according to one unnamed Trump administration official it's especially hard to land a date if you're affiliated with the White House well I hope the initial click was enough to get the self-confidence you needed to get out of bed cuz it seems like just the opinion of one unnamed unverified person who may or may not be affiliated with the White House just basically said he's been going through a cold streak and unfortunately what the oracles trying to say couldn't be farther from the truth let's look at some real stats shall we according to a published article in the politics and life science journal quote controlling for socioeconomic status we find that more attractive individuals are more likely to report higher levels of political efficacy identify as conservative and identify as Republican unquote well maybe these two professors just pulling people in tuscaloosa in Nashville Tennessee nah turns out the study on right leading politicians from the United States Europe and Australia were found to be more attractive according to the study but hey let's go with one unnamed dude in DC in a town that is 90% liberal but maybe these conservatives just sexy hard-working principled jerks who are super close-minded jerks well cosmopolitan sure did try to make it seem that way in one of the most condescending articles I have ever read please go read this is absolutely horrible even they said quote after surveying 500 Millennials 200 Gen Xers and 200 Baby Boomers MTV made some pretty interesting discoveries when it came to those hell-bent on making America great again they found that they are actually pretty open to dating those quote with her unquote but don't worry liberals cosmopolitan doesn't leave you hanging they go on to explain this away saying that liberals are just more picky whoo-hoo-hoo dodged a bullet there and that Trump supporters more discriminating in other ways well let's just see when it comes to literally blocking friends because you find out they merely voted for someone different than you in a two-party race the prr eye survey that was taken December 7th through the 11th among over 1,000 people says quote Democratic voters are almost three times as likely to have blocked unfriended or stopped following someone on social media after Donald Trump's victory so I guess that means conservatives are better looking nicer and more open-minded so maybe all the virtue signaling moral posturing and loud shrieking is more of a compensation for a much bigger problem drew Schwartz I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood did you enjoy that video of course you enjoyed that video so now you need to become a Premium Member to the rebel that way you have first access to pure Hollywood and the entire rebel lineup you
