Bill: WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE IN LOS ANGELES ON THAT. Julie: FOR MORE ON THIS CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGGS JOINS US, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US. THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS WILLING TO SEND IN THE MILITARY TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IF NECESSARY AND THREATENED TO SEAL THE U.S./MEXICO BORDER. CAN HE DO IT? I THINK HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO IT. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T WANT TO SEE HAPPEN NECESSARILY. SO I THINK THAT TOUGH RHETORIC HAS SPAWNED THIS COOPERATING ATTITUDE FROM MEXICO. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT THING, ACTUALLY. Julie: HERE IS THE PRESIDENT IN MONTANA AT A RALLY LAST NIGHT AND GOT A HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE MULTIPLE TIMES LAST NIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN HE BLAMED THE DEMOCRATS FOR OH THE CARAVAN. I'M WILLING TO SEND THE MILITARY TO DEFEND OUR BORDER CAUSED BY THE IMMIGRATION ONSLAUGHT BROUGHT BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR CHANGE THE LAWS. THEY LIKE IT. THEY ALSO FIGURE EVERYBODY COMING IN IS GOING TO VOTE DEMOCRAT, YOU KNOW? THEY'RE NOT SO STUPID WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT? BUT THEY ARE CRAZY. Julie: WHERE DO DEMOCRATS STAND ON STOPPING THIS CARAVAN IF NANCY PELOSI HAD HER WAY AND TOOK CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THE CASE SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO MAKE IMMIGRATION REFORM THE HOUSE WOULD MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY. WHERE DO THE DEMOCRATS STAND ON STOPPING THE CARAVAN IF THEY WERE IN CONTROL? WOULD THEY TRY TO STOP THE CARAVAN? NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. THEY'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR. NANCY PELOSI MADE IT CLEAR YESTERDAY NO WALL, NO BORDER SECURITY. OPEN BORDERS. TALKED ABOUT ELIMINATING ICE. SO THEY AREN'T GOING TO HAVE A REAL HEARTBURN I WOULDN'T GUESS WITH 4,000 PEOPLE IN A CARAVAN COMING OVER AT ONE TIME AND I THINK THEY WOULD BE PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THAT WOULD CHANGE THIS COUNTRY AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO GET CONTROL OF THE IMMIGRATION LAWS. WE NEED TO GET THEM BACK. Julie: I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR TWITTER HANDLE BLOWING UP. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT YOU EARLIER, DID YOU KNOW? I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT. Julie: CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGGS IS DOING A GREAT JOB FOR ARIZONA AND OUR COUNTRY. NOT A BAD ENDORSEMENT. THE PRESIDENT HOLDING A RALLY IN ARIZONA TONIGHT. WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA LOOKING FOR? WHAT DO THEY WANT TO SEE ON IMMIGRATION ESPECIALLY? THEY WANT TO SEE THE BORDER WALL GO UP. THEY WANT TO SEE THE BORDER SEALED OFF. I WAS JUST AT THE BORDER LAST WEEK AND I JUST TELL YOU, WE HAVE GOT A REAL PROBLEM. THE BORDER IS POROUS. THEY WANT TO SATISFY MORE AGENTS. WE HAVE STATIONS WITH HALF THE COMPLIMENT OF AGENTS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. THEY WANT TO SEE THEY VIEW THIS AS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE AND WANT THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS, TOO, TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT WHAT HE NEEDS TO ENACT THESE LAWS. Julie: I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS. ROD ROSENSTEIN. THE GOP HAS BEEN DYING TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT POTENTIALLY TALKING AND PLANNING ON WIRETAPPING AND INVOKING THE 25th AMENDMENT THE SECOND WEEK ON THE JOB. HE WILL FINALLY TALK TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK. JOHN RATCLIFFE, WHAT HE SAID ABOUT WHETHER ROSENSTEIN SHOULD BE FIRED. WHATEVER EXPLANATION ROD ROSENSTEIN GAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP ON AIR FORCE ONE LAST WEEK SATISFIED THE PRESIDENT AT LEAST FOR NOW. I THINK ROD ROSENSTEIN SHOULD HAVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND HE WILL GET THAT NEXT WEEK. Julie: DID IT SATISFY THE PRESIDENT OR IS THE PRESIDENT PLAYING HIS CARDS RIGHT? I THINK HE IS PLAYING HIS CARDS RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT. I JUST AM REALLY CONCERNED WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN EVEN IF HE WAS SAYING THIS IN JEST IT SHOWS A DISTINCT LACK OF JUDGMENT. I WONDER IF WE CAN REALLY TRUST HIM. I'M ACTUALLY HOPING THAT WE MAKE THIS A MORE OPEN DEPOSITION WHERE ROSENSTEIN IS SWORN IN. WE HAVE A TRANSCRIPT AND WE GET TO ASK QUESTIONS RATHER THAN HIDING IT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AS HIS BEHALF. Julie: THERE WERE CALLS HE WOULD BE FIRED. WILL HE WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT WAITING FOR EXACTLY? WELL, I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING FOR HE HAS TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT READY. HE HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS THING. HE ALSO IS TRYING TO GIVE ROSENSTEIN SOME ROOM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING FOR BECAUSE I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT I BELIEVE A YEAR AGO ROSENSTEIN SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE BECAUSE HE HAS TREMENDOUS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. Julie: OKAY. SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION? LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IF ROSENSTEIN GOES? THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. AND YOU WOULD HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD STILL HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE THEY HAVEN'T EXERCISED IT TOO MUCH: IT WOULD STILL CONTINUE. Julie: IS THERE ANY TIME THAT INVESTIGATION WILL NOT CONTINUE? WILL IT EVER END? JUST CURIOUS.
