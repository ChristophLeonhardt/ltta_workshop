161
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,581
WHAT IT MIGHT DO. 

162
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,784
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT MARK HAD TO

164
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,720

165
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,822
HOLD FOR SEVERAL MORE MONTHS. 

166
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,690

176
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,141
PESSIMISTIC THAT THE ECONOMY IS 

177
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,010

178
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,245

179
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,114

180
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,150

00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,259
AND HE NAILS IT.

186
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,061
THEY'RE THE IDEA OF WHERE THE 

187
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,262
MARKET IS, WHERE THE EXPERTS  

188
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,066
ARE, WHERE THE FED IS IS ONE BIG

189
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,135
JUMBLE. 

190
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,503
DAVID: IF YOU GO OVER THE LAST  

191
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,338
FEW MONTHS WHEN THE FED HAS 

192
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,472
DISAGREED WITH THE MARKETS, THE 

193
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:44,376
FED HAS COME TO THE MARKET. 

194
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:45,344
HE'S NOW SAYING NONETHELESS,  

195
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,313
THAT THE MARKET MAY BE WRONG. 

196
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,481
TOM: BUT THE KEY THING IS A TIME

197
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:53,419
FUNCTION OUT TO 2017 AND 2018.

198
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,454
MOST PROS AND THIS HAS HAPPEN 

199
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,689
OFEREDE THE LAST 10 YEARS,  

200
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,459
DAVID, PEOPLE USED TO MAKE GRAND

201
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,828
18-MONTHS PROJECTIONS.

202
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,963
THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY IN THE 

203
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,330
GAME. 

204
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,631
THE GAME IS WHAT'S GOING TO 

205
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,665
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT MEETING OR 

206
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,667
MAYBE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE

207
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,735
SEPTEMBER MEETING AND THEN YOU  

208
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,669
GO ON YEAR END. 

209
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,639
MOST PROS ARE NOT LOOKING OUT NO

210
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,774
AN ANALYSIS OF 2018.

211
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,776
DAVID: IT'S TOO FAR TO LOOK.

212
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,111
BUT YOU HAD SOMEONE ON  

213
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,746
"SURVEILLANCE." 

214
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,048
YOU HAD THE MARK GILBERT PIECE  

215
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,783
WHICH WAS FASCINATING SAYING  

216
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:28,754
MAYBE A RISE IN THE RATES WOULD 

217
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,688
HELP GROWTH.

218
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:33,959
TOM: SETH MASTERS SAID IT TO  

219
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,860
THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION 

220
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,861
WHICH IS BRILLIANT. 

221
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,830
I REALLY EMPHASIZE TO PEOPLE TO 

222
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,999
READ MARK GILBERT'S PIECE OUT 

223
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:40,399
TODAY.

224
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,034
I'LL PUT IT OUT ON SOCIAL.

225
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,003
AND THE IDEA IS IF EVERYBODY  

226
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,837
RAISES RATES TOGETHER, WHAT 

227
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,038
WOULD BE THE OUTCOME? 

228
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:51,310
THIS IS THE RING FISHER WHO IS  

229
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,845
CONSIDERED THE GIANTS.

230
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,981
AND THE BELIEVE IN IT IS A  

231
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,050
BELIEF BASED ON VERY LITTLE 

232
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,052
EXPERIMENT AND VERY LITTLE DATA.

233
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,154
AND AS PROFESSOR BOWEDER SAID,  

234
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,057
THERE'S A REAL QUESTION OF  

235
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,992
WHETHER IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IF

236
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,995
WE ALL RAISED RATES BECAUSE OF  

237
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,165
CAPITAL INVESTMENT WAS STOPPED. 

238
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,200
DAVID: ALTHOUGH IT HAD TO DO  

239
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,103
WITH DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE 

240
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,271
EXTENT-TO-WHICH THE GRADES -- 

241
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,107
TOM: YOU PUT ME IN THERE. 

242
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,609
DAVID: THEY WOULD HAVE MORE 

243
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,378
MONEY TO SPEND IF YOU RAISED  

244
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:26,745
RATES.

245
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,314
TOM: YES. 

246
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:33,185
THE FAVORS DO BETTER AND IT 

247
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:37,456
WORKS BOTH WAYS BUT THERE'S THIS

248
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:37,990
WORD, AMBIGUOUS.

249
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,359
THERE'S A LOT OF AMBIGUOUS  

250
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,360
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 

251
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,429
MICROECONOMICS OF THESE KINDS OF

252
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:43,862
THEORIES. 

253
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,464
HERE'S THE THEORY.

254
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,434
THE NUMBERS COME AT 8:30 AND THE

255
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,468
MARKETS WILL REACT. 

256
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,438
IT'S A LIVE JOBS REPORT.

257
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,539
DAVID: WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.

258
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,474
THANKS VERY MUCH, TOM KEENE FOR 

259
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,942
JOINING US FROM "SURVEILLANCE"  

260
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,309
RADIO.

261
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,645
YOU'LL WANT TO TUNE IN EVERY  

262
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,846
MORNING FOR "BLOOMBERG  

263
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,714
SURVEILLANCE" RADIO WITH TOM  

264
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,649
KEENE AND MIKE MCKEE. 

265
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,617
ALIX: WE ARE AN HOUR AWAY FROM  

266
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,753
THAT ALL IMPORTANT JOBS NUMBER. 

267
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,688
HOW ABOUT 175,000 JOBS TO BE  

268
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,689
CREATED IN JUNE?

269
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,791
THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT STANDISH 

270
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,795
IS EXPECTING. 

271
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,763
VINCENT REINHART JOINS US.

272
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:23,102
THERE'S 175K PUT THE RATE HIKE  

273
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:23,936
BACK IN PLAY? 

274
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,037
VINCENT: PROBABLY.

275
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,139
SO REMEMBER TWO THINGS ABOUT THE

276
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,073
JOB NUMBER. 

277
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,008
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT

278
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,977
OF A STICKER SHOCK BECAUSE  

279
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,978
35,000 WORKERS ARE GOING TO BE  

280
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,847
COMING BACK FROM THE VERIZON  

281
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,914
STRIKE. 

282
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,282
WE KNEW IT WAS SUBTRACTING FROM 

283
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,184
THE MAY TOTAL BUT PEOPLE STILL  

284
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,186
GOT IMPRESSED AT HOW LOW THAT 

285
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:41,653
NUMBER WAS. 

286
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,322
THE SECOND THING IS THE REACTION

287
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,257
PROBABLY GOING TO BE ASYMMETRIC.

288
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,159
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A STRONG 

289
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,028
ENOUGH NUMBER THAT PUTS THE FED 

290
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,997
BACK IMMEDIATELY INTO PLAY. 

291
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,066
175,000 IN THAT VICINITY WILL 

292
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,102
GET PEOPLE TO PRICE OUT POLICY  

293
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,171
EASING THIS YEAR AND START  

294
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,139
TALKING ABOUT THE SEPTEMBER 

295
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:00,539
MEETING.

296
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,107
BUT ONLY BE TALK. 

297
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,043
ALIX: BUT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO  

298
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,011
BE THAT WOULD PUT THE FED HIKE  

299
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,181
NOT ON THE TABLE WAS A BAD MAY  

300
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:09,648
JOBS NUMBER.

301
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:14,353
SO WE GET A GOOD JUNE JOB 

302
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,054
NUMBER. 

303
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,356
HOW DOES THE FED NOT BEING  

304
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,390
BEHIND THE CURVE? 

305
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,259
VINCENT: THREE THINGS.

306
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,361
THE FIRST, THEY WERE WORRIED  

307
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,129
ABOUT THE U.K. REFERENDUM.

308
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,330
THAT'S PASSED.

309
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,466
SO IT WASN'T JUST JOBS THAT KEPT

310
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,333
THEM OFF THE TABLE. 

311
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,303
AND THE WORST CASE EVENTUATED.

312
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,372
SO THEY MIGHT SAY THERE IS A LOT

313
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,374
OF UNCERTAINITY.

314
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,575
SECOND, REMEMBER WHAT JANET 

315
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,645
YELLEN SAID AND THAT IS DON'T 

316
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,279
OVERCOUNT ONE NUMBER. 

317
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,647
PEOPLE WILL SAY THIS IS A 

318
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,415
BACKWARD LOOKING READING ON 

319
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,516
WHERE WE WERE IN JUNE.

320
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,585
LOTS OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED  

321
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,453
SINCE.

322
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,554
NOW, THEY'RE GOING TO NEED A  

323
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,489
COUPLE MORE READINGS TO 

324
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,558
ESTABLISH THAT THERE'S A  

325
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,425
MOMENTUM IN THE ECONOMY.

326
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,627
THIRD, GO BACK TO WHAT JANET  

327
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:58,497
YELLEN WAS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE

328
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,900
WAY BACK INTO HER PHILADELPHIA  

329
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,935
SPEECH AND HER PRESS CONFERENCE.

330
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,903
SHE LIKES TO SEE JOB CREATION ON

331
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,038
THE ORDER OF WHAT WE SAW EARLIER

332
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,774
THIS YEAR AND IN 2015.

333
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,743
THAT WAS 200,000 NET JOBS 

334
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:12,811
CREATED PER MONTH.

335
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,713
THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH HURDLE.

336
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,882
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A BIT TO BE  

337
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,084
CONVINCED THAT THE ECONOMY HAS  

338
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:19,518
MOMENTUM. 

339
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,352
JONATHAN: I WANT TO GO ALL THE  

340
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,887
WAY BACK TO THE PREVIOUS  

341
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:22,888
TIGHTENING CYCLE WHERE WE SAW 

342
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,891
THE 50,000 AND YET THE FEDS WENT

343
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:26,859
AHEAD AND HIKED RATES.

344
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,895
WHY THE OVERWHELMING BIAS TO  

345
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,096
VIEW THESE SMALL JOB NUMBERS AS 

346
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,165
BAD AT A TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE 

347
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,901
REACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT AND  

348
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,369
JOBS GROWTH SHOULD BE SHIFTING? 

349
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,105
WHY IS THIS THE BEST THING? 

350
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,106
VINCENT: SO I DON'T GET IT  

351
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,474
EITHER, BUT YOU DON'T REALLY  

352
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,275
CARE ABOUT MY OPINION AND WHAT  

353
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,143
THEY SHOULD DO. 

354
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,078
IT'S WHAT I THINK THEY'LL DO. 

355
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,249
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING IT'S THE 

356
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,284
CON JUNK CHER BEING THIS CLOSE  

357
00:15:52,284 --> 00:16:01,460
TO THE LOWER BOUND. 

358
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,262
AND KEEP THE EXPANSION GOING  

359
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,364
THAN OVERTIGHTEN TOO SOON 

360
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,366
BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE 

361
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,534
POLICY INSTRUMENTS YOU'RE 

362
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,469
CONFIDENT IN IF YOU TIGHTEN TOO 

363
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,336
QUICKLY.

364
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:14,339
JONATHAN: I CAUGHT UP WITH THE  

365
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,408
PRESIDENT IN LONDON AND HE'S  

366
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,577
WORRIED ABOUT FRESH CREDIBILITY.

367
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,711
A MARKET THAT'S PRICED OUT ANY  

368
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,613
FED ACTION FOR THE NEXT TWO 

369
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,347
YEARS.

370
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,584
THEY TELL US THAT WE STILL  

371
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,619
DEBATE WHICH DATA IT IS AND WE  

372
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,721
DO THAT MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER 

373
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,088
MONTH.

374
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,590
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A BIG 

375
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,791
CREDIBILITY PROBLEM DOWN IN D.C.

376
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,292
AT THE FED? 

377
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,760
VINCENT: THERE IS A PROBLEM.

378
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,596
IT GOES BACK TO THE DEEP WATERS 

379
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,797
THAT TOM KEENE AND COMPANY WERE 

380
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,665
TALKING ABOUT.

381
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,733
I'M NOT SURE IT'S CHAOS YET BUT 

382
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,901
IT'S CONCERNING.

383
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,603
AND THAT IS WE'RE SEEING THE END

384
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,806
OF POLICY GUIDANCE AS AN  

385
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,943
EFFECTIVE TOOL, I.E.,, CONVEYING

386
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,111
THE WHOLE PATH OF FUTURE POLICY 

387
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,846
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS 

388
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,114
AND USING THAT AS AN INSTRUMENT.

389
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:56,815
WHY?

390
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,016
BECAUSE THE WORLD'S TOO 

391
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,885
UNCERTAIN TO MAKE CREDIBLE  

392
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,887
COMMITMENTS.

393
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,122
SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE, LET ALONE

394
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,457
A YEAR AND A HALF IN ADVANCE. 

395
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,126
SO THEY ARE GOING MEETING BY  

396
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,262
MEETING IN THEIR POLICY 

397
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:10,729
DECISIONS.

398
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,430
PROBLEM IS THEY'RE STILL  

399
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,098
PUBLICING A SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC 

400
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,201
PROJECTIONS THAT TELLS YOU THE  

401
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,336
WHOLE FUTURE PATH FOR INTEREST  

402
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,637
RATE, CONDITIONAL AS IT IS. 

403
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,339
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T 

404
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,242
REALLY KNOW WHAT THE TERMINAL 

405
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,377
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IS, HOWEVER  

406
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:27,546
THIS TIGHTENING CYCLE WILL END. 

407
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:32,751
AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ARE 

408
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,553
DAMAGING TO THE CREDIBILITY, THE

409
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:34,920
FED.

410
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,489
THAT'S WHY THEY KEEP ON 

411
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,559
EMPHASIZING DATA. 

412
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,661
PROBLEM IS THE DOT CHART, THE 

413
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,929
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC PROJECTION  

414
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:44,763
IS HAUNTING THEM. 

415
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,932
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME. 

416
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,867
IT'S LESS GOOD NOW. 

417
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,736
DAVID: MR. BULLARD PUT OUT THERE

418
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,871
THAT WE SHOULD STOP MAKING  

419
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:53,905
PROJECTIONS TOO FAR UP BECAUSE  

420
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,807
THEY COULDN'T KNOW IT.

421
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,010
HAS ANYONE PICKED UP ON THAT? 

422
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,177
I WAS SURPRISED THERE'S NOT MORE

423
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:00,045
OF A REACTION.

424
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,147
VINCENT: IF YOU GO BACK TO THE  

425
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,248
TRANSCRIPTS, ONE THING YOU'LL 

426
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,185
SEE EVERY TIME THE F1C TALKED 

427
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,453
ABOUT A COMMUNICATIONS POLICY 

428
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,122
AND IT WAS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER 

429
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,057
OF THOSE SUBCOMMITTEES AND  

430
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,227
SECRETARY ECONOMISTS, AND THEY  

431
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,397
ALWAYS SAY IF WE DO SOMETHING TO

432
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,165
ENHANCE COMMUNICATION, WE CAN 

433
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,300
NEVER GO BACK.

434
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,501
AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL  

435
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,469
THAT THEY'VE RAISE THIRD BAR ON 

436
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:27,272
WHAT THEY RELEASED AND TAKING 

437
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,474
SOMETHING BACK SEEMS  

438
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:29,975
UNDEMOCRATIC. 

439
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,412
IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, TO CHANGE 

440
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,415
THE DIRECTION OF PROGRESS AND 

441
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,449
TRANSPARENCY. 

442
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,484
SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE 

443
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:40,519
TO TAKE THAT AWAY UNLESS THEY 

444
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,454
FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER WAY TO DO.

445
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,556
ALIX: SEEMS TO BE LIKE YOU WANT 

446
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,425
TO KILL THE DOT.

493
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,164
SOMEWHAT OUT OF THE EUROPEAN

495
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,172

00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,315

499
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,382
ARE THEY TRYING TO GET SOME 

500
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,350
PICKUP? 

501
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,618
KEN: THEY'RE GOING MORE TO THE  

502
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,453
YIELD TO GET SOME CREDIT SPREAD 

503
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:08,920
IN THERE. 

504
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,422
SO THEY'RE GOING INTO THE 

505
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,524
CORPORATE FUNDS, INVESTMENT 

506
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,024
GRADE FUNDS.

507
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,693
IT'S MORE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING  

508
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,760
THAN THE GOVERNMENT FUNDS.

509
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,697
JONATHAN: YOU LOOK AT EUROPEAN  

510
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,230
PERIPHERAL DATA.

JOB WHERE WE GET THE LATEST 

513
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,469

514
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,706
HASHED TO RECONCILE YIELDS WITH 

515
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,709
PAY GROWTH LESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT

516
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,511
SOUTH OF FIVE?

517
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,679
KEN: A LOT OF WHAT'S CAUSING  

518
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,414
YIELDS IS THE YIELDS IN THE REST

519
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,417
OF THE WORLD ARE SO LOW.

520
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,519
THERE'S CONSTANT MOVE TOWARDS 

521
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,755
YIELDS AND THE U.S. IS LOOKING  

522
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,824
FAIRLY ATTRACTIVE TO A LOT OF 

523
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,626
GLOBAL INVESTORS. 

524
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,827
JONATHAN: FOR GLOBAL INVESTORS  

525
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,862
LOOK INTO YOUR FUNDS, THE 

526
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,832
PASSIVE STORY, A LOT OF PEOPLE  

527
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,699
HAVE PAINTED A PICTURE THAT IT'S

528
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,867
ALL ABOUT COST. 

529
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,902
IS IT ALL ABOUT COST? 

530
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:00,872
KEN: IT'S A BIG PART OF THE MOVE

531
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,108
TOWARDS PASSIVE IS ABOUT COST 

532
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,977
BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING, THE FLOW 

533
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,179
HAS BEEN STRONG AND AT VANGUARD,

534
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:09,881
WE'RE SEEING A PICKUP IN ACTIVE 

535
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,283
FLOWS, ESPECIALLY IN FIXED  

536
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:12,684
INCOME. 

537
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,085
AND EVEN ON THE ACTIVE SIDE T 

538
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:14,986
ABOUT COST. 

539
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,055
IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY IS MOVING  

540
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,089
INTO THE LOWER COST ACTIVE  

541
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,058
FUNDS, NO THE HIGHER COST OR  

542
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,226
MODERATELY COST ACTIVE FUNDS. 

543
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,961
JONATHAN: THE STORY OVER THE  

544
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,130
LAST FIVE, SIX YEARS HAS BEEN 

545
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,364
PASSIVE OVERACTIVE. 

546
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,332
DO YOU SEE THAT CHANGING  

547
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,299
FUNDAMENTALLY IN ANY WAY AS THE 

548
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,402
YEARS PROGRESSED? 

549
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,269
KEN: I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING. 

550
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,138
I THINK THE FLOW HAS CONTINUE TO

551
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,208
MOVE TOWARDS THE PASSIVE BUT THE

552
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,344
ACTIVE FLOW TEND TO MOVE TOWARDS

553
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,378
THE LOWER COST ACTIVE.

554
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,579
AND THAT'S THE INTERESTING STORY

555
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,314
GOING FORWARD IS REALLY 

556
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,283
INVESTORS LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE

557
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,252
AVERAGE EXPENSE RATIOS ON THE 

558
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,353
ACTIVE FUNDS THAT THOSE 

559
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,256
INVESTORS WHO BELIEVE IN ACTIVE 

560
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,224
AND HAVING A LOWER HURDLE RATE  

561
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,427
TO OVERCOME BY ACTUALLY LOOKING 

562
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,530
AT THE LOWER COST ACTIVE FUNDS. 

563
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,532
JONATHAN: HAVE THEY CHANGED 

564
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,367
THEIR CONVICTIONS TO WHERE THEY 

565
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,536
SEE THE WORLD SINCE THE 

566
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,437
REFERENDUM IN THE U.K.? 

567
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,539
KEN: THERE'S STILL A LOT OF 

568
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,540
UNCERTAINTY GOING FORWARD, HOW  

569
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,608
THE E.U. IS GOING TO WORK WITH  

570
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:13,678
THE U.K. IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING

571
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,447
THE EXIT. 

572
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,848
SO THERE'S STILL SO MUCH  

573
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,450
UNCERTAINTY GOING FORWARD AND 

574
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,519
WHAT THAT DOES IS IT CAUSES 

575
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,654
BUSINESSES TO REDUCE THEIR  

576
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,888
INVESTMENT SPENDING, CAUSES 

577
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:26,658
CONSUMERS TO PULL BACK AND BE 

578
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,727
CAUTIOUS, REAL ESTATE PRICES  

579
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,795
HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE BIT OF A  

580
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:31,162
HIT.

581
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,698
AND THAT CREATES THAT KIND OF 

582
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,966
UNCERTAINTY THAT IS GOING TO BE 

583
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,768
HURTFUL TO THE U.K. ECONOMY AND 

584
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,937
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY. 

585
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,905
JONATHAN: SOMEONE IN LONDON TOLD

586
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:44,709
ME DON'T BOTHER WATCHING BECAUSE

587
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,778
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW THAT WE'VE

588
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,880
HAD THIS POST-BREXIT MOVE.

589
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,749
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

590
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:54,886
KEN: I THINK THE FED IS PROBABLY

591
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,955
PRICED OUT UNTIL THE END OF THE 

592
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,990
YEAR, DECEMBER, OR MAYBE THE  

593
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,925
FIRST QUARTER OF 2017.

594
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:04,129
INVESTORS DO NEED TO NEWS THESE 

595
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,463
KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES  

596
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,297
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE AND IN THE 

597
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:09,067
U.K. TO REBALANCE THEIR 

598
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,302
PORTFOLIO TO THE LONGER TERM  

599
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:11,703
MIX.

600
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,238
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT

601
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,406
TO DO AFTER THE MARKET HAS  

602
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:16,374
DROPPED CONSIDERABLY IS TO LEAVE

603
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,475
THE MARKET BECAUSE THE MARKET 

604
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,410
HAS PRICED IN A LOT OF THAT 

605
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:19,811
NEWS. 

606
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,246
IT'S A GREAT TIME LIKE IN THE 

607
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,614
U.K. AND IN EUROPE, EQUITIES  

608
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,449
HAVE UNDERPERFORMED BONDS.

609
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,483
IT'S A GREAT TIME TO REBALANCE  

610
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,586
YOUR MIX BACK INTO EQUITIES AND 

611
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,388
BONDS TO KEEP YOUR LONGER TERM  

612
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,423
MIX WITH THE KIND OF RISK THAT  

613
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,559
YOU WANT TO TAKE AS AN INVESTOR.

614
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,828
JONATHAN: THANK YOU, KEN, GREAT 

615
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,663
TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. 

616
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,697
DAVID: THANKS VERY MUCH.

617
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:40,732
THAT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION.

618
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,834
COMING UP ON "BLOOMBERG GO,"  

619
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,469
U.K. HOUSING FUNDS ARE UNDER  

620
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,505
DURESS AND THERE MAY SEEM TO BE 

621
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,706
NOWHERE TO GO BUT DOWN. 

622
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:49,741
BUT IS THAT RIGHT?

623
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,676
WE HAVE SOME CHARTS TO TELL US. 

624
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:52,310
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

625
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,410

626
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,243
JONATHAN: FROM LONDON AND NEW

38 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE PAY

ROLLS REPORT. 

630
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,516
THIS IS THE SCENE IN GLOBAL 

631
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:11,950
MARKETS.

632
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,318
FUTURES FIRM FOR THE U.S. 

633
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,652
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HEADING FOR A 

634
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,421
WEEK OF LOSSES IN THE UNITED  

635
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,322
STATES AND IN EUROPE. 

636
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,223
THE FTSE UP.

637
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:20,525
D'BACKS AND FRANKFURT UP. 

638
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,226
SWITCH OF THE BOARD VERY  

639
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:23,294
QUICKLY.

640
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,595
HERE'S THE OTHER ASSET CLASSES  

641
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:25,363
FOR YOU.

642
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,433
DOLLAR YEN, CLOSE TO 100 MARK.

643
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,469
IT'S THE STRONGER JAPANESE YEN  

644
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,403
STORY.

645
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,606
THE CABLE RATE STABLE AROUND  

646
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:36,007

647
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,676

00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,577
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

649
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,612
WE TRADE AT 1.39%.

650
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,448
UNCHANGED TODAY AHEAD OF THAT 

651
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,615
PAYROLLS REPORT.

652
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:45,516
ALIX? 

653
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:46,784
ALIX: ONE OF THE BIG STORIES OUT

654
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,653
OF THE U.K. THIS WEEK HAD TO BE 

655
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,721
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE U.K. 

656
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,590
PROPERTY FUNDS SEIZING UP AND 

657
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,760
HALTING SOME REDEMPTION.

658
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,761
CREDIT SUISSE SAYS THERE IS MORE

659
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,898
DOWNSIDE FOR THE OPEN-ENDED 

660
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:01,265
FUNDS.

661
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:05,036
CLOSE-END FUNDS LIMIT AMOUNT OF 

662
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:05,470
SHARES. 

663
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,270
THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  

664
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,771
THE TWO.

665
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,805
PREREDEMPTION.

666
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,241
THIS BLUE LINE ARE CLOSE-ENDED  

667
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:10,608
FUNDS.

668
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,077
THEY HAD ABOUT 20% DECLINE. 

669
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,246
THIS ORANGE LINE ARE OPEN-ENDED 

670
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:15,613
FUNDS.

671
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,215
THOSE ARE THE GUYS THAT HATTED  

672
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,049
THE REDEMPTIONS AND THEY HAD  

673
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,020
ABOUT A 5% DECLINE BEFORE THE 

674
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,520
SUSPENSIONS.

675
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,389
POINT BIGS IN ORDER FOR THE OPEN

676
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,024
ENDED TO CATCH UP WITH THEIR  

677
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,091
PEERS, THERE HAS TO BE A LOT  

678
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,059
MORE DOWNSIZE.

679
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,029
AND THE 15% MORE DOWNSIDE TO GET

680
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,996
TO THAT LEVEL.

681
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,099
IN ADDITION, COME OF THE  

682
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,200
CLOSED-END FUNDS THAT WE HAVE 

683
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,169
BEEN SEEING ARE TRADING AT  

684
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,170
SEVERE DISCOUNTS TO THEIR NET 

685
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,171
ASSET VALUE.

686
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,305
WE CAN PULL THIS OTHER CHART. 

687
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:44,308
SO THIS WHITE LINE HERE IS U.K. 

688
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:45,209
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST FUND. 

689
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:49,180
IT IS A CLOSED END FUND AND THIS

690
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,648
BLUE LINE IS COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

691
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,251
TRUST, ALSO A CLOSED-END FUND.

692
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,318
THIS IS ZERO. 

693
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:55,620
WHEN THEY WIND UP CLOSING ABOVE 

694
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,489
THAT LEVEL, IT MEANS THEY'RE  

695
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,424
TRADING A PREMIUM, MEANING A  

696
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,725
PREMIUM TO THE ASSETS THAT THEY 

697
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,460
HAVE IN THAT FUND.

698
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,562
NOW BELOW ZERO, THEY'RE LOOKING 

699
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,664
AT A DISCOUNT WHERE ARE THEY  

700
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:07,498
SHOWING NOW?

701
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,567
A PRETTY SEVERE DISCOUNT TO THE 

702
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,668
UNDERLYING ASSET. 

703
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,104
SO JOHN, CREDIT SUISSE'S POINT  

704
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,773
IS OPEN-ENDED FUNDS HAVE A LOT  

705
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:16,707
MORE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE IF  

706
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:18,910
THEY'RE GOING TO MATCH THE  

707
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,745
DOWNSIDE WE'VE SEEN IN THE  

708
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,979
CLOSE-ENDED FUNDS.

709
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:22,780
A TOPIC WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

710
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,982
ALL WEEK. 

711
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:25,983
JONATHAN: ONE OF THE BIG  

712
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,286
APPEARINGLE IS THE DIFFERING  

713
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,087
APPROACHES FROM INDIVIDUAL FUNDS

714
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,955
ABOUT HOW THE HANDLING THE  

715
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,090
REDEMPTION STORY. 

716
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,992
ABERDEEN FOR INSTANCE, TELLING  

717
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,061
INVESTORS THERE COULD BE 24 

718
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,429
HOURS I'M GOING LET YOU DECIDE  

719
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,132
WHETHER YOU WANT TO TAKE THE  

720
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,467
WRITE-OFF OR REALIZE THE LOSS 

721
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,501
AND PULL YOUR MONEY OUT AND 

722
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,235
THAT'S FINE.

723
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,270
OTHER FUNDS SAYING 28 DAYS AND  

724
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,372
THEN RECONSIDER.

725
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,441
SO ALL THESE DIFFERENT FUNDS  

726
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,209
WITH DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IN  

727
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:55,480
TERMS OF HOW THEY HANDLE THE  

728
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,947
REDEMPTIONS.

729
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,415
ALIX: IMACCUMULATIONS FOR 

730
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,383
INVESTERS AND FOR BANKS WHO 

731
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,352
MIGHT HOLD THESE UNDERLYING 

732
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,587
LOANS AS WELL.

733
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,456
DAVID, WE SAW A LOT OF THIS IN  

734
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,425
2008 AND 2009 WHEN THE MORTGAGE 

735
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,593
CRISIS HIT. 

736
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,661
THE TRICKLE DOWN WAS SELLING  

737
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,729
GETS SELLING. 

738
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,964
YOU SELL CELSKI WHAT YOU CAN, 

739
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,632
NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO. 

740
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,667
DAVID: WE HAVE NOT SEEN IS  

741
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,735
ACTUAL PRICES FOR REAL ESTATE 

742
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,669
GOING DOWN. 

743
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,705
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS  

744
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,672
TRICKLES THROUGH THE ACTUAL 

745
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,740
AMOUNT OF MONEY PEOPLE ARE  

746
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,709
PAYING IN A REAL ESTATE IN THE  

747
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,611
U.K. WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN YET.

748
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,646
ALIX: WE HAVE ESTIMATES FROM 20%

749
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,648
DECLINE IN THOSE UNDERLYING REAL

750
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,750
ESTATE ASSETS.

751
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,919
DAVID: FOR OFFICE RENTS.

752
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,386
20% DOWN. 

753
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,154
ALIX: YEAH. 

754
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,054
DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE'RE GOING

755
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,891
TO BE KEEPING OUR EYE ON AS THE 

756
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,159
BREXIT FALLOUT CONTINUES. 

757
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,059
DAVID: THANKS.

758
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,128
THAT'S REALLY GOOD. 

759
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,063
THE LATEST ON THE BREAKING NEWS

FROM AN UGLY MAY.

774
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,512
ANYTHING SET OUT THE REST OF

775
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,713
2015? 

776
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:28,252
>> TROUBLED ASSETS GROW OVER

777
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,488

GOVERNMENT.

779
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:31,756
STATE INTERVENTION CANNOT BE

780
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:32,156

HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG <GO>." 

788
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:58,916
WE WILL LOOK AT THE TELESTRATING

789
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,084
SHORTLY.

790
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,687
I HAVE ALIX STEEL AND JONATHAN

FERRO HERE WITH ME.

792
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:05,956
WE ARE 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM U.S.

793
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,224
JOBS DATA, AND THAT IS THE BIG

794
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:07,625
FOCUS.

795
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,927
JONATHAN: RIGHT AFTER THOSE

796
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:10,895
NUMBERS ARE OUT, WE WILL HAVE

797
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,998
NUMBERS ON ON THE PROGRAM TO

798
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:14,932
BREAK DOWN WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE

799
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:15,266
FED.

800
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,635
BETTY: -- 

801
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:23,441
ALIX: THE CEO OF A COMPANY WILL

802
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,776
BE HERE WITH US.

803
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,677
TRADERS DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP

804
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,211
POSITIONS HERE.

805
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:31,515
JONATHAN: FUTURES ARE FIRMER, UP

806
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,483

807
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:37,854
THE, LONDON DOING GOOD.

808
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:41,959
ALMOST 1.5% ON THE DAX.

809
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,793
WE HAD FOR A WEEK OF LOSSES FOR

810
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,363
EUROPE AND THE U.S. 

811
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,864
SWITCHING UP VERY QUICKLY, HERE

812
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,098
ARE THE OTHER ASSET CLASSES.

813
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:50,100
THE FX MARKET, DOLLAR-YEN, WE

814
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,335
BROKE THE 100 MARK.

815
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:54,271
WILLIE DO THAT AGAIN IN ABOUT 30

816
00:37:54,271 --> 00:38:01,078
MINUTES TIME, I WILL GET THAT,

817
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:01,479
1.45.

818
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,246
IT IS A STRONGER JAPANESE YEN

819
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,549
FOR A STRONGER DAY.

820
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:10,387
1.39% FOR METALS, AND CRUDE

821
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:11,188
POTENTIALLY THE BIGGEST DROP IN

822
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,391
THE YEAR.

823
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,594
ALIX: UNBELIEVABLE.

824
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:21,432
WE ARE 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE

825
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,767
JUNE JOBS REPORT, AND WE HAVE

826
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:23,934
TEAM COVERAGE.

827
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:24,802
WE HAVE THE CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST

828
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,370
FROM BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE,

829
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,172
RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICHAEL

830
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,908
MCKEE.

831
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:31,876
FIRST OF ALL, THE NUMBERS,

832
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:32,409
PREDICTION? 

833
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:36,680
>> THE FORECAST IS 180,000.

834
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,517
WALL STREET IS LEADING A LITTLE

835
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:39,984
STRONGER.

836
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,586
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS --

837
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,354
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SKEW OF THE

838
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:43,821
FORECAST.

839
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:49,894
IT DOES POINT TOWARDS A BELIEF

840
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,095
AMONG ECONOMISTS WE MIGHT BE

841
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:51,529
STRONGER.

842
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,833
ALIX: PART OF THAT NOT JUST

843
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,201
POTENTIAL PAYBACKS BUT VERIZON

844
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,002
WORKERS COMING BACK FROM STRIKE.

845
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,338
YOU HAVE TO COUNT JUST

846
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,105
DISCOUNTED 35,000 FROM THAT

847
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:01,539
NUMBER.

848
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,742
>> WE SHOULD HAVE ADDED 35

849
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,677
NUMBERS TO GET A CLEANER READER,

850
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,511
BUT IT IS STILL A LOUSY NUMBER

851
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,980
FOR MAY.

852
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,182
HE SAID SUBTRACT 35,000 FROM THE

853
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:15,853
JUNE RESULT.

854
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,654
I AM CONCERNED WE COULD BE ON

855
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,421
THE SOFTER SIDE OF THINGS.

856
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,991
THE BLS COULD BE VERY SEASONAL,

857
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:25,563
AND THE MORE TYPICAL SEASONAL IN

858
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,397
MAY, WE WOULD'VE HAD WEAKER

859
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,065
NUMBERS.

860
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,434
THERE IS A PENCHANT FOR WEAKER

861
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,201
NUMBERS TO PERVADE THE LABOR

862
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:34,138
DATA, NOT ONLY INJURED WITH

863
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:34,872
DAVID: THE NEXT COUPLE OF

864
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,239
MONTHS.

865
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,206
DAVID:DO NUMBERS TEND TO BE

866
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:36,574
WEAK.

867
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,344
>> THERE IS A MILD MOP BIAS.

868
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,248
IT IS OUR TO ADJUST FOR THE

869
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:44,982
BACK-TO-SCHOOL SEASON WHEN

870
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:45,683
PEOPLE MOVE IN AND OUT.

871
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,786
ALIX: THE OTHER PART IS WAGES,

872
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:55,693
EXPECTATIONS OF 2.7%.

873
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,460
THIS LOOKS TAX WITHHOLDING

874
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,696
RECEIPTS.

875
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,430
YOU PAY MORE MONEY TO THE

876
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,735
GOVERNMENT, THINKING -- THANK

877
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,436
YOU FOR MAKING THIS CHART.

878
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,370
IF I CAN ZOOM IN OVER THE LAST

879
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,372
FEW MONTHS, YOU SEE IT INCREASE.

880
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,475
IS THAT SUSTAINABLE? 

881
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:15,779
>> IT IS IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE

882
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:16,781
PEOPLE GET JOBS.

883
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,582
ON THE BASIS, THE NUMBERS ARE

884
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,753
WORRIED -- RUNNING WEAKER.

885
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,823
THE NUMBERS ARE MET MATCHING UP.

886
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,725
JUST NOT MATCHING UP.

887
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:32,062
ARE WE REALLY SEEN PEOPLE GET

888
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,163
HIRED OR NOT? 

889
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:35,733
IT IS NOT A PERFECT CORRELATION,

890
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,533
BUT IT DOES TELL YOU SOMETHING.

891
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,769
ALIX: IF THE WAGE INCREASES AND

892
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,740
THE TAX WITHHOLDING ARE THE

893
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,708
MINIMUM WAGES, AT SOME POINT,

894
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,509
THAT JUICE IS GOING TO WEAR OUT.

895
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,947
>> I THINK IT IS HAPPENING

896
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,714
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM, AS WE ARE

897
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,617
SEEING LABOR SCARCITY IN AN

898
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,385
ARRAY OF FIELDS, ESPECIALLY

899
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,520
HIGHER SKILLED OPENINGS.

900
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,426
SO I THINK THAT WILL BEGET MORE

901
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:02,993
WAGE PRESSURES.

902
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,761
WAGE PRESSURES ARE CRITICAL TO

903
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,097
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE JOBS

904
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:07,498
REPORT.

905
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:08,132
WE ALWAYS JOKE, THIS IS

906
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,167
IMPORTANT, BUT THIS ONE REALLY

907
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:10,534
IS.

908
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,335
I WOULD THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

909
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,937
DATA POINT IN THE LAST SIX

910
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,072
MONTHS, BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE

911
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:15,806
PACE OF HIRING DWINDLING NOT

912
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:20,144
JUST IN MAY BUT OVER A SUSTAINED

913
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,511
TIME.

914
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:26,617
THERE IS REAL QUESTIONS, IS THIS

915
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:27,518
DUE TO ECONOMIC WEAKNESS OR A

916
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,186
MORE MATURE ECONOMY? 

917
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:29,953
IF IT IS THE ECONOMY, YOU NEED

918
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,088
TO SEE WAGE PRESSURE

919
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,056
ACCOMPANYING IT.

920
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,059
DAVID: FUNNY UP THE AVERAGE

921
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,828
NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED OR WEEK,

922
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,663
WE TALK ABOUT THIS EVERY TIME

923
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:46,537
AND YOU NOTE A .1% VARIANCE IN

924
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,304
THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS

925
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,072
WORKED WOULD BE THE SAME AS HOW

926
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:48,505
MANY JOBS? 

927
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:52,376
>> OVER 300,000.

928
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:56,046
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE PAYROLL GAIN

929
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:56,847
INTO BROADER CONTEXT OF WHAT IT

930
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,917
MEANS FOR HOURS WORKED AND

931
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:00,517
AGGREGATE INCOME.

932
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,720
IT TELLS US ABOUT GDP GROWTH FOR

933
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,454
THE QUARTER AND HOUSEHOLD

934
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:03,821
INCOME.

935
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:04,555
DAVID: MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU

936
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,222
LOOKING AT? 

937
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:09,059
>> THE HEADLINE NUMBER FOR ALL

938
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,527
THE REASONS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING

939
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:11,295
ABOUT.

940
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,498
JANET YELLEN MADE IT A BIG DEAL

941
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,299
ABOUT MINORITY UNEMPLOYMENT AND

942
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,601
MINORITY EARNINGS.

943
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,502
SHE LET OFF HER TESTIMONY LAST

944
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:22,339
MONTH WITH THAT.

945
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,075
AFRICAN EMPLOYMENT DOUBLED THE

946
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:25,876
WHITE RATE, AND IT HAS NOT COME

947
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,543
DOWN AS FAST AS IT HAS FOR

948
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,279
WHITES.

949
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,348
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER

950
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,716
OR NOT THAT MOVES A

951
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,550
SIGNIFICANTLY, BECAUSE IT MAY

952
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,519
SUGGEST HER BIAS SUPPORTS ITSELF

953
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:35,919
LONGER.

954
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:38,589
DAVID: SHE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION

955
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,590
ABOUT THE INABILITY TO GET THE

956
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,994
NUMBER DOWN.

957
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:44,795
>> IT IS A TOOL, BUT SHE CAN

958
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:45,362
KEEP RATES LOWER.

959
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:49,767
DAVID: THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO

960
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,434
THE CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR

961
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:51,201
BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE AND MIKE

962
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:51,936
MCKEE.

963
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,971
ALONGSIDE TOM KEENE,

964
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,140
INTERVIEWING THE CAPITAL FUND

965
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,974
MANAGER AFTER THE NUMBERS COME

966
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:57,307
OUT.

967
00:42:57,307 --> 00:43:00,410
ALIX: WHAT IT MEANS FOR STOCKS,

968
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,746
WE HAVE THE CITIGROUP CHIEF U.S.

969
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,783
EQUITY STRATEGIST.

970
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,985
GOOD TO SEE YOU ON THIS SHOW ON

971
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:08,385
FRIDAY.

972
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,855
THE S&P, A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

973
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:12,222
TODAY.

974
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,891
WE ARE NEAR RECORD HIGHS.

975
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,193
WHAT DO THEY HAPPEN SO THE

976
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:16,960
MARKET IF WE GET A GOOD JOB

977
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,327
NUMBER? 

978
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:21,565
>> IT IS SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC

979
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,300
EARNINGS PHENOMENON.

980
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,134
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WAGES AND

981
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:28,472
WORKERS EARNINGS, BUT CORPORATE

982
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,273
EARNINGS HAVE BEEN STUBBORNLY

983
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:29,640
HIGH.

984
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,042
THEY HAVE NOT GONE HIGHER, OR

985
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,710
LOWER IN THE LAST 18, 21 MONTHS.

986
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,347
YOU WONDER WHY THE STOCK MARKET

987
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:40,551
IS NEAR ALL-TIME HIGHS, BECAUSE

988
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,285
EARNINGS ARE NEAR ALL-TIME

989
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:41,652
HIGHS.

990
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,452
IT THERE IS A STRONG CORRELATION

991
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:45,456
BETWEEN THE TWO FACTORS.

992
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,323
IF YOU START TO BELIEVE THERE IS

993
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,058
A BETTER ECONOMY, YOU OUGHT

994
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:48,826
UNDERSTAND BETTER EARNINGS AND

995
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,526
THERE IS A POSITIVE TREND.

996
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:54,097
ALIX: IT SEEMS THE MARKET IS

997
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:55,899
PRICING AN OK JOB NUMBER, AND

998
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:56,533
THEN A DIMINISHED FED.

999
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,136
IF WE WANT A KILLER NUMBER, DOES

1000
00:43:59,136 --> 00:43:59,937
THAT FOR THE RATE HIKE BACK ON

1001
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:00,370
THE TABLE? 

1002
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:06,043
>> I HATE INTERRUPTING, BUT A

1003
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:06,743
SINGLE DATA POINT WILL NOT

1004
00:44:06,743 --> 00:44:08,278
CHANGE THE FED'S MIND, AND I

1005
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,279
DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD

1006
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:13,617
PROCEED AS THE ULTIMATE -- I GET

1007
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,418
VERY NERVOUS JUST FOCUSING ON A

1008
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,085
SINGLE NUMBER.

1009
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,388
IT BECOMES VERY TOPICAL, ON THE

1010
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:19,156
GIVEN DAY, WE HAD A VERY POOR

1011
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,390
NUMBER REPORTED FOR THE MAY

1012
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,627
JOBS.

1013
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:27,130
AND YET, THE STANDARD DEVIATION

1014
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:27,898
OF REVISIONS ULTIMATELY ARE

1015
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,467
ABOUT 100,000 IN A GIVEN MONTH.

1016
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:34,705
IF YOU HAD 60 SOMETHING THOUSAND

1017
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:35,539
, AND IN 160,000 WILL WE LOOK AT

1018
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,541
THEM TO YEARS LATER, THE STREET

1019
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,544
REACTS TO THE NEWS.

1020
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,880
STRATEGISTS SAID BACK AND SAY,

1021
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,680
ONE DATA POINT IS NOT GOING TO

1022
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,581
CHANGE MY VIEW ONE DAY OR

1023
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,017
ANOTHER.

1024
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:47,684
ALIX: [INDISCERNIBLE]

1025
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:48,151
[LAUGHTER]

1026
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:52,289
>> IT DOES NOT EXTEND TO VIEWERS

1027
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,090
OF ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THOUGHTFUL

1028
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:53,523
ABOUT IT.

1029
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:56,627
DAVID: MY COLLEAGUE POINTS UP

1030
00:44:56,627 --> 00:45:00,497
THE FED REPEATEDLY SAID THE DATA

1031
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:04,668
IS DEPENDENT.

1032
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:05,469
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

1033
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:05,969
DEPENDING ON.

1034
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:06,570
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS

1035
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,004
CONFUSION.

1036
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,239
IS THAT PART OF THE FED'S FAULT

1037
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,741
IN THE CLARITY OF THEIR

1038
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,441
EXPRESSION, OR ARE THEY

1039
00:45:11,441 --> 00:45:14,745
CONFUSING DATA, PLAYING THE HAND

1040
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,312
THAT DEALT THEM? 

1041
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,849
>> THERE IS GREAT UMBRAGE WHEN

1042
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,819
THE FED IS CRITIQUED BY MANY

1043
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:23,720
PEOPLE WHO DON'T ACTUALLY LOOK

1044
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,490
AT AS MUCH DATA AS THE 20 --

1045
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,028
2000 PHD'S WHO WORK IN THE FED.

1046
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,130
I CAN'T SIT THERE AND SAY THEY

1047
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,164
ARE MAKING COSTLY MISTAKES.

1048
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:37,434
THE FED STRUCTURE, OR YOU HAVE

1049
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,469
THESE DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS IN

1050
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:40,237
DIFFERENT CITIES WHO HAVE THE

1051
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,940
ABILITY TO SPEAK THEIR MIND, AND

1052
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,707
THEY ARE NOT SPEAKING FOR THE

1053
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:47,478
FED, BUT THEMSELVES, THEY CREATE

1054
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,211
CAUTION AND COMMUNICATION.

1055
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:49,213
DIFFERENT VOICES ARE HEARD IN

1056
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,816
THE FOC MEETINGS AS WELL, THE

1057
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,019
CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIR GET A

1058
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,254
CONSENSUS MESSAGE OUT.

1059
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,990
ONE THING IS REALLY CONFUSING

1060
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,926
WHEN THE FED TALKS ABOUT DATA IS

1061
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,062
THIS IDEA OF MARKET DEPENDENCY,

1062
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,297
ALSO.

1063
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,533
IT IS PART OF THE DATA THEY

1064
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,367
WATCH BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO WORRY

1065
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:10,968
ABOUT FEEDBACK LOOPS.

1066
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,269
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE.

1067
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,439
IN JANUARY, ONE OF THE WORST

1068
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,275

THE S&P 500 NAMES, 200 OUT OF

1070
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:28,852
500, MORE DOWN -- WERE DOWN 45%.

1071
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,822
IMAGINE YOUR STOCK IS DOWN 35%

1072
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,825
TO 45%, YOU THINK THE WORLD IS

1073
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:35,692
ENDING, YOU CUT BACK INVESTMENT,

1074
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,427
DON'T HIRE AS MANY PEOPLE.

1075
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,128
YOU WORRY ABOUT THE STOCK

1076
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,696
MARKET.

1077
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,464
THE FED SAYS WE UNDERSTAND

1078
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,666
FEEDBACK LOOPS.

1079
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,935
WE HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF

1080
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:45,802
MARKETS, NOT JUST THE LABOR DATA

1081
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:46,169

FIVE WERE KILLED.

1097
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,101

1106
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,357
REPORTER: POLICE HAVE ARRESTED

1107
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:40,891

1110
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,228

KINDS OF ATTACKS OR ANY VIOLENCE

1117
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,543

1118
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,411
THE FBI IS ALREADY IN TOUCH WITH

1119
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,246

1120
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:04,448

1126
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:14,791
A CRIME SCENE.

1127

POLICE ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO

00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,829
AVOID IT.

1129
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,663
IN TAIWAN, A TYPHOON HAS KILLED

1130
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:23,533
AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE AND FORCED

1131

IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

1186
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,195
I QUESTION TO YOU IS, I WAS

1187
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,029
TRYING TO GAUGE HOW THIS MARKET

1188
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:46,463
WAS PRIMED.

1189
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,333
HOW IS IT PRIMED? 

1190
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,401
HOW DOES IT REACT TO A DOWNSIDE

1191
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,269
SURPRISE IN THE LABOR MARKET

1192
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,004
REPORT? 

1193
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:58,942
>> I THINK STRONGER JOB NUMBERS

1194
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:04,181
WILL GENERATE MORE OF A RELIEF.

1195
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,950
MAY HAD FEARS ABOUT SLOWING, ANY

1196
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,284
KIND OF RECOVERY FROM THAT TREND

1197
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:10,153
WOULD BE POSITIVE, I BELIEVE.

1198
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:13,957
IF YOU HAVE CONTINUED WEAKNESS,

1199
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:14,791
PEOPLE WILL START TO DOUBT THE

1200
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:15,592
STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY AND THE

1201
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:19,462
ABILITY TO GENERATE EARNINGS.

1202
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:24,467
VERY STRONG WOULD PROBABLY ALSO

1203
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,171
GENERATE SOME, IF YOU LIKE, FED

1204
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,774
CONCERNS, BUT PEOPLE WILL TRY TO

1205
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:31,641
PRICE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF IT

1206
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:35,512
LATE -- RATE HIKE LATER THIS

1207
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:39,249
YEAR.

1208
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,049
ONE PRODUCT WILL NOT GET YOU

1209
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:40,417
THERE.

1210
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,151
THE FEDERAL WANT TO SEE OTHER

1211
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,852
THINGS.

1212
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:43,653
WE LOOK AT THE BREXIT VOTE OR

1213
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,756
THE ITALIAN BANKS, THE FED WILL

1214
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,125
TAKE A HARSHER POSTURE.

1215
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:49,926
ONE DATA POINT DOES NOT CHANGE

1216
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:50,594
THAT.

1217
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,630
JONATHAN: THE LABOR PRESIDENT

1218
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,565
HERE LAST WEEK SAID THE BREXIT

1219
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,601
DECISION SHOULD HAVE PRETTY MUCH

1220
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,736
NOTHING TO ZERO IMPACT ON THE

1221
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,037
U.S. ECONOMY.

1222
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,672
WHY IS THERE A CONCERN FOR U.S.

1223
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,775
EQUITIES.

1224
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,510
I UNDERSTAND FOREIGN EARNINGS

1225
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,412
ARE A BIG MAKEUP OF THE S&P 500,

1226
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,615
BUT WHEN WE WOKE UP UNDER 24 AND

1227
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:13,416
SAW THE S&P 500 AND CONSTITUENTS

1228
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,718
DOWN, WAS THAT OVERDONE? 

1229
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:18,755
TOBIAS: I AM NOT SURE IT HAS NO

1230
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,790
IMPACT WITH RESPECT TO THE

1231
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,227
EARLIER COMMENT.

1232
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,129
I THINK IT HAS MODEST IMPACT.

1233
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:26,996
EUROPE IS PROBABLY A PERCENT OF

1234
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:29,732
THE S&H -- ESSEN IT P5 HUNDRED

1235
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:33,203
SALES.

1236
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:37,107
-- S&P 500 SALES.

1237
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,310
FOOD, BEVERAGE, TOBACCO AM A

1238
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,110
THEY ARE STILL TAKING THE DRUGS

1239
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,879
THEY HAVE TO TAKE WITH RESPECT

1240
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,382
TO THE BREXIT VOTE.

1241
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:46,249
SO THE LAST ONE PRESENT MIGHT BE

1242
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,150
CYCLICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS LET'S

1243
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:52,856
SAY IT DROPS 20%, SO POINT 02%.

1244
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:53,923
IT IS NOT ZERO.

1245
00:54:53,923 --> 00:55:01,397
THERE IS A DOMINO EFFECT.

1246
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:02,131
AND THEN, IS THERE A VOTE IN

1247
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:05,302
FRANCE, ITALY, SPAIN? 

1248
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,169
EVERYBODY FREEZES.

1249
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,671
IT WOULD NOT SAY NO IMPACT, BUT

1250
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,074
IT IS A SECONDARY EFFECT.

1251
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:11,808
THAT WAS WHAT MY POINT WAS.

1252
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,077
DAVID: YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

1253
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:17,113
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CEO AND

1254
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:17,914
WHETHER IT IS BREXIT OR WHAT THE

1255
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,649
FED MIGHT DO OR WHAT THE

1256
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,152
ECONOMY, OR THEIR STOCK PRICES.

1257
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,220
THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

1258
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,321
FACING THE CEOS WE NEED TO GET

1259
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,224
PAST.

1260
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:30,994
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST DETERMINANT

1261
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,828
ON DETERMINING WHETHER THEY WILL

1262
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,462
HIRE PEOPLE OR INVEST? 

1263
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:38,001
TOBIAS: ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE,

1264
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:38,801
WE DID A STUDY LOOKING AT 700

1265
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:41,338
COMPANIES IN THE U.S., AND

1266
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,473
ENERGY, WE ALL KNOW ENERGY IS

1267
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,407
DOWN.

1268
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:47,210
BUT ASK ENERGY, THE AGGREGATE

1269
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,212
CAPITAL SPENDING PLAN FOR 2015

1270
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:53,182
IS UP 25%.

1271
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:54,450
THAT IS HIGHER THAN WE THOUGHT

1272
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,485
THE STUDY BACK IN FEBRUARY, UP

1273
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:56,619
4%.

1274
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,523
THE BIGGEST DRIVERS, TECHNOLOGY,

1275
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,593
MEDIA, COMPANIES THAT HAVE TO

1276
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,360
INVEST IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY,

1277
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,362
RESPONDING TO OR CUTTING AND

1278
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,864
THINGS LIKE THAT, OR IN

1279
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,665
TECHNOLOGY, YOU ARE TALKING

1280
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,632
ABOUT CYBER SECURITY, THINGS

1281
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,099
LIKE THAT.

1282
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:12,802
DAVID: IT IS OFTEN THE PRETTY

1283
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,704
LOW BASE.

1284
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,339
IN THE LAST 20, 30 YEARS -- 

1285
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:20,643
TOBIAS: NO.

1286
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:21,344
CAPITAL SPENDING HAS BEEN

1287
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,679
GROWING.

1288
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,982
IT HAS BEEN GROWING EVER SINGLE

1289
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,650
YEAR WE HIT RECORDS IN 2011,

1290
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,820
2012, 2013, 2014.

1291
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,288
2015, WAS A PULLBACK BECAUSE OF

1292
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:32,689
ENERGY.

1293
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:37,761
ASK ENERGY WAS UP.

1294
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:38,561
AND IT IS JUST INACCURATE.

1295
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:44,133
CAPITAL SPENDING AT THE HEAD OF

1296
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:44,968
BUYBACKS EVERYTHING A YEAR SINCE

1297
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,436
2009, AND THE RECORD YEAR WAS

1298
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:46,903
2007.

1299
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,640
WE ARE THIS DRUMBEAT -- HERE

1300
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,642
THIS DRUMBEAT OF INACCURATE DATA

1301
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:53,142
BEING SPOUTED.

1302
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:57,180
DAVID: SO I WAS WRONG, AND I'M

1303
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:57,814
GLAD TO BE CORRECTED.

1304
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,048
TOBIAS: EVERYBODY IS WRONG ON

1305
00:56:59,048 --> 00:56:59,482
THIS ONE.

1306
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,883
DAVID: WHY IS A PRODUCTIVITY

1307
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:01,951
COMING OUT? 

1308
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:06,055
TOBIAS: I TALKED TO THE

1309
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:09,192
PROTESTERS -- PROFESSORS IN THE

1310
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,461
U.S., AND THEY THINK IT IS BEING

1311
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:12,261
MEASURED CORRECTLY FOR THE MOST

1312
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:12,595
PART.

1313
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,432
YOU TAKE AN UBER CAR RIDE FOR

1314
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:15,932
INSTANCE.

1315
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,835
YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR.

1316
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:19,569
BEHIND THE SCENES, YOU ARE

1317
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,871
GETTING BILLED, RIGHT? 

1318
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,773
THERE IS A BILLING PROCESS

1319
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,375
HAPPENING IN THE CLOUD, BUT YOU

1320
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,075
WALK OFF THE TO YOUR NEXT

1321
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,511
MEETING OR WHATEVER.

1322
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,178
THAT IS PRODUCTIVITY.

1323
00:57:29,178 --> 00:57:31,214
THERE WAS A PROCESS OF A BILL

1324
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:34,717
PAYMENT BEING GENERATED.

1325
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,085
IT GOES TO YOUR E-MAILS, THIS IS

1326
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,621
WHAT YOU SPEND, ETC. 

1327
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,422
SOMETHING IS GOING ON, BUT WE

1328
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:40,823
DON'T MEASURE IT THAT WAY IN

1329
00:57:40,823 --> 00:57:42,225
TERMS OF HOURS.

1330
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:47,430
MOST OF THE KIND OF ACADEMIC

1331
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,665
GROUPS THAT LOOK AT THIS BELIEVE

1332
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:49,432
THERE IS A MEASUREMENT ISSUE.

1333
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:52,402
ALIX: SO YOU HAVE 3% EARNINGS

1334
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,972
GROWTH FOR 2016 FOR THE S&P.

1335
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:56,839
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF

1336
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:57,574
ORGANIC GROWTH.

1337
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:01,778
AND IN CITIGROUP SAYS THE

1338
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:05,181
BREXIT--- HEIGHTENED THE RISK.

1339
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,616
HOW DO YOU EVEN THIS? 

1340
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:11,754
TOBIAS: GREAT RESPECT FOR PHIL,

1341
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:14,524
SO IF I SAY ANYTHING BAD, IT

1342
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:15,692
WILL COME BACK TO ME.

1343
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,528
THE CONTEXT IS THE SAME, IT USES

1344
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:20,830
THE TERM A GROWTH RECESSION.

1345
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,500
IT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

1346
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,301
MODEST GROWTH, THE U.S. BEING

1347
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,770
ONE OF THE BETTER ELEMENTS OF

1348
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:28,271
THAT GROWTH.

1349
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,105
THERE WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT

1350
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,307
OVER THE LAST DOUBLE YEARS.

1351
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:32,075
IT IS NOT EVEN EUROPE OR THE

1352
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:32,976
U.S., IT IS EMERGING MARKETS.

1353
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,811
THAT HAD BEEN THE ENGINE OF

1354
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,613
GROWTH GLOBALLY AND THE SLOWDOWN

1355
00:58:37,613 --> 00:58:41,718
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

1356
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:42,518
MONTI'S AND COUNTRIES, FOR

1357
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:42,919
EXAMPLE.

1358
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:43,720
LET'S GO TO THE U.S..

1359
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,090
70% OF THE SALES ARE NORTH

1360
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,325
AMERICAN.

1361
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,193
WE ARE MORE DOMINATED BY WHAT IS

1362
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:54,296
GOING ON HERE.

1363
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:55,798
THE GROWTH IS SLOWER THAN WE

1364
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:56,399
ANTICIPATED BEFORE.

1365
00:58:56,399 --> 00:59:00,203
YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER, YOU NEED

1366
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,003
SOMETHING MORE DEVASTATING TO

1367
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:01,738
HER THE EARNINGS OF THE U.S..

1368
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,573
WE HAD A COUPLE OF THINGS

1369
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,409
HURTING US, ENERGY.

1370
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,945
THAT WAS 80%, BUT HE PERCENT WAS

1371
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:13,116
THE TRAWLER -- DOLLAR -- 20% WAS

1372
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,018
THE DOLLAR.

1373
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:19,222
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ISN

1374
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,022
MANUFACTURING NEW ORDERS, THEY

1375
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:21,090
HAVE BEEN OUT FIVE MONTHS IN A

1376
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,893

1377
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:28,731
FOR INDUSTRIAL TRENDS.

1378
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,232
IT IS DOWN.

1379
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:29,999
IF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GOES

1380
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:33,536
UP, WHICH INDICATORS SAY IT

1381
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,303
WILL, EARNINGS WILL FOLLOW.

1382
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:37,140
YOU SPREAD OVERHEAD COSTS A COST

1383
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,874

1384
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:38,241

OTHER CYBER SECURITY STOCKS

1428
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:34,944
COULD BE SOUGHT SOARING.

1429
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,647
JONATHAN: LET'S LOOK AT WHAT KEY

1430
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:41,117
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.

1431
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,552
JEFFREY'S MANAGING DIRECTOR OF

1432
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:44,320
FOREIGN EXCHANGE IS LOOKING AT

1433
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,821
THE IMPACT OF TODAY'S JOB REPORT

1434
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:46,355
ON THE DOLLAR.

1435
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,190
GREAT TO HAVE YOU.

1436
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:52,161
BECAUSE OF THIS TUG-OF-WAR

1437
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:52,962
BETWEEN SAFE HAVEN BID FOR THE

1438
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,063
DOLLAR ON ONE SIDE AND RAPIDLY

1439
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,398
DECLINING EXPECTATIONS OF

1440
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,868
ACTIVITY ON THE FED ON THE OTHER

1441
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,202
, WHICH SIDE WINS? 

1442
01:04:00,202 --> 01:04:01,370
WHEN WE GET THE BREAKOUT? 

1443
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:06,809
>> IF WE GET A BIG NUMBER IN

1444
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:07,576
ENOUGH COMBINED WITH AVERAGE

1445
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:13,149
EARNINGS OF 0.3% OR 0.4% MONTH

1446
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:15,051
OVER MONTH, THAT WOULD BE BIG

1447
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:15,785
AND THE DOLLAR WOULD RALLY

1448
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:16,252
SIGNIFICANTLY.

1449
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,187
HE WOULD HAVE TO REPRICE THE

1450
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,956
FED.

1451
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:20,756
THE SUMMER 2016 COMES BACK ON

1452
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:26,194
THE CARDS.

1453
01:04:26,194 --> 01:04:27,029
-- DECEMBER 2016 COMES BACK ON

1454
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:27,897
THE CARDS.

1455
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:28,664
IT WOULD NOT DO MUCH ON THE

1456
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,634
DOLLAR STORY.

1457
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,936
WE REMAIN IN THE SAME TUG-OF-WAR

1458
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:34,470
WE ARE IN NOW.

1459
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,473
IF WE GET A BIG MISS, THERE IS A

1460
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:38,074
ASYMMETRIC SET UP.

1461
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:38,908
IF WE GET A BIG MISS LOWER, THAT

1462
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,443
WILL BE BAD FOR MARKETS.

1463
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:45,581
WE MIGHT HAVE TO PASS GLOBAL

1464
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,048
RECESSION.

1465
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,651
IF THE DOLLAR GETS HIT INITIALLY

1466
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,452
, AND THEN PROBABLY COMES BACK

1467
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,352
ON A SAFE HAVEN BID.

1468
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:52,888
DOLLAR-YEN IT WILL BE THE ONE

1469
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:53,622
THAT SUFFERS THE MOST IN THAT

1470
01:04:53,622 --> 01:04:54,724
REGARD.

1471
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,059
THE TUG-OF-WAR IS IN PLACE.

1472
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:57,827
LOOKING FOR NUMBER OUTSIDE OF

1473
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:58,794
THE CONSENSUS AND THE

1474
01:04:58,794 --> 01:04:59,361
COMFORTABLE RANGE.

1475
01:04:59,361 --> 01:05:02,698
JONATHAN: TALKING ABOUT

1476
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,467
ASYMMETRIC RISK, LOOK ABOUT THE

1477
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,904
DOLLAR.

1478
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,072
IF WE COULD CAPTURE THIS, THE

1479
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:10,840
DOLLAR IS UNDERPERFORMED

1480
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,876
EVERYTHING BAR THE CABLE RATE

1481
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:17,079
AGAINST STERLING.

1482
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,281
GIVEN THE MOVE EITHER WAY,

1483
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:20,049
SURELY THE POTENTIAL FOR THE

1484
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,984
UPSIDE IS BIGGER, GIVEN WE HAVE

1485
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,653
A LOT OF STOCK MOVEMENT AND

1486
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:25,321
TALKING FROM THE FED.

1487
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:28,023
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

1488
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:28,958
WE HAVE SEEN THE DOLLAR

1489
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,827
WEAKENING AGAINST COMMODITY

1490
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:32,761
CURRENCIES AND THE YEN.

1491
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:35,298
IT DID RALLY AGAINST EMERGING

1492
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,132
MARKETS AND THE POUND, BUT NOT

1493
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,867
AGAINST THE EURO.

1494
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:38,567
THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR THE

1495
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:39,568
DOLLAR TO RALLY.

1496
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,971
ANY MEANINGFUL SHIFT IN U.S.

1497
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:46,642
RATES WILL GIVE THAT INTO THE

1498
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,945
DOLLAR.

1499
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,046
IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

1500
01:05:51,046 --> 01:05:56,385
THE FED TO HAVE AN EXCITED --

1501
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,186
EXTENDED DOLLAR RALLY, AND THAT

1502
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:57,653
WILL BE KEY.

1503
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:01,991
JONATHAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1504
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,492
40 SECONDS AWAY FROM THE PAYROLL

1505
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:03,893
REPORT.

1506
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,061
LET'S CHECK IN ON THE MARKETS.

1507
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,129
THE SCORECARD AHEAD OF THAT,

1508
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,099
THIS IS HOW WE TRADE. FUTURES

1509
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:10,933
ARE FIRM IN THE UNITED STATES.

1510
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:13,736
EQUITIES ARE UP IN EUROPE, THE

1511
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:18,674
DAX UP 1.35%, THE FTSE 0.3%.

1512
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:19,475
THIS IS ALL THE FX MARKET IS

1513
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,244
POSITIONED.

1514
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:28,917
DOLLAR-YEN, 149.49.

1515
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:29,652
A STRONGER POUND STORY IN

1516
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,188
TODAY'S SESSION. YIELDS HAVE NOT

1517
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,389
CHANGED ON THE 10 YEAR.

1518
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,191
1.39% IS HOW WE TRADE ON THE

1519
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,727
U.S. 10 YEAR.

1520
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:38,594
THE JUNE PAYROLL REPORT IS RIGHT

1521
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:42,331
HERE WITH JULIE HYMAN.

1522
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:47,570
JULIE: 287,000 JOBS ADDED IN

1523
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,338
JUNE, THAT IS THE BEST GAIN

1524
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,375
SINCE OCTOBER 2015.

1525
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:55,044
BETTER THAN 180,000 ESTIMATED BY

1526
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,412
ECONOMISTS.

1527
01:06:56,412 --> 01:07:01,283
AND THE ECONOMY -- 4.9% VERSUS

1528
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,419
4.7% AS UNEMPLOYED ROSE.

1529
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:09,458
EARNINGS GAINING 0.1%, HALF OF

1530
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,092
WHAT WAS ESTIMATED.

1531
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:12,194
THE OTHER IMPORTANT NUMBER, MAY

1532
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:18,534
REVISE IS DOWN FROM A GAIN OF

1533
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:18,934
38,000.

1534
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,570
APRIL REVISED HIGHER TO 144,000

1535
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,339
123,000.

1536
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,073
THAT MEANS THE THREE-MONTH

1537
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,508
AVERAGE GAIN IS 147,000 VERSUS

1538
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:30,179
THE 12 MONTH AVERAGE GAIN OF

1539
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,614
129,000.

1540
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,582
SO THEY CAME FROM GAINS IN

1541
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:37,052
LEISURE, HOSPITALITY, SOCIAL

1542
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:37,753
ASSISTANCE, AND FINANCIAL

1543
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:38,187
ACTIVITIES.

1544
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,957
PRIVATE SECTOR GROWS 25,000.

1545
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,859
IN MAY, THE GAINS THAT IT

1546
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,462
HAPPENED, HAPPENED BECAUSE OF

1547
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,898
GOVERNMENT HIRING.

1548
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,000
THIS FELL BY 6000 IN MAY.

1549
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,601
IT WAS THE FIRST DECLINE SINCE

1550
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,970
FEBRUARY 2010.

1551
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:58,574
THERE WAS THE VERIZON EFFECT ON

1552
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,009
THE INFORMATION CATEGORY.

1553
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:00,743
THE BIGGEST DROP IN PRIVATE

1554
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,543
SECTOR AND HURRYING IN THE MONTH

1555
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:04,780
OF MAY -- HIRING WAS IN

1556
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:09,351
TEMPORARY AGENCIES.

1557
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,586
62.7%.

1558
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,722
THE AVERAGE WORK WEEK AT 74 .4%.

1559
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,292
THE HEADLINE, 287,000 JOBS ADDED

1560
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,795
IN JUNE, AND MAY REVISE DOWN TO

1561
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,197
11,000.

1562
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,466
JONATHAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1563
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:25,267
MARKETS TRADING ON THE UPSIDE.

1564
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,870
A BIG BEAT FOR THE MONTH OF

1565
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,371
JUNE.

1566
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:30,805
THE TWO-YEAR YIELDS GOING UP

1567
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:36,578
FIVE BASIS POINTS, TO 63.

1568
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:37,345
10 YEAR YIELDS UP FOR BASIS

1569
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:42,917
POINTS, ZERO POINT -- 1.43.

1570
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:43,652
A STRONGER DOLLAR STORY.

1571
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:44,453
THE CABLE RATE IS PUTTING BACK

1572
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,087
DOWN TO 129.

1573
01:08:46,087 --> 01:08:49,524
THE DOLLAR INDEX UP 0.1%.

1574
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:53,962
THE INITIAL REACT IN THE MARKET

1575
01:08:53,962 --> 01:08:55,397
IS UP.

1576
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,566
WITH EVERY DEEP THAT REMAINS TO

1577
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,399
BE SEEN, BUT WE ARE TRADING ON

1578
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,403
THE UPSIDE SURPRISE.

1579
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:09,111
ALIX: TWO HUNDRED 87,000 JOBS

1580
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:09,678
ADDED IN JUNE.

1581
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:11,313
MUCH MORE EVEN IF YOU BACK OUT

1582
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,082
37,000 FOR THE VERIZON WORKERS.

1583
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:14,883
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A GAIN OF

1584
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:15,451
250,000 WORKERS.

1585
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,620
DAVID: IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS

1586
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,723
GOING TO BE HALF OF THAT.

1587
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,059
I WAS SURPRISED BY HOW ALL OVER

1588
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:24,792
THE PLACE THE NUMBERS WERE.

1589
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:28,796
ALIX: 11,000 JOBS DOWN FROM

1590
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:31,466
38,000.

1591
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:32,267
AND YOU ARE SEEING THE MARKET

1592
01:09:32,267 --> 01:09:33,068
SORT OF MOVE HIGHER ON THAT.

1593
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,803
LET'S GO TO TOM KEENE AND

1594
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,006
MICHAEL ON BLOOMBERG RADIO.

1595
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:42,176
THEY ARE SPEAKING WITH JANET ON

1596
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:42,944
THE MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED

1597
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:44,180
JOBS REPORT.

1598
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,314
TOM: WE WELCOME BLOOMBERG

1599
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:47,049

AUDIENCE.

1601
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:49,919
WE HAVE JP MORGAN HERE.

1602
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:54,256
BILL GROSS OF JANET'S CAPITAL.

1603
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,124
THIS IS A POINT WHERE YOU SMOOTH

1604
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,926
THINGS OUT.

1605
01:09:57,926 --> 01:09:58,727
I'M LOOKING AT A THREE MONTH

1606
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:02,231
MOVING AVERAGE OF 147,000.

1607
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,967
THAT IS STABILIZING THE SHOT

1608
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,069
THAT WE SAW LAST MONTH.

1609
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:11,306
BILL: YEAH, I THINK SO.

1610
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:13,175
THE FED'S STATEMENT LAST MONTH

1611
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,077
SUGGESTED UNEMPLOYMENT,

1612
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:15,577
UNCERTAINTY.

1613
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:20,149
AS USED -- AS YOU STRAIGHT

1614
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:21,150
THINGS OUT, THAT DOES IT.

1615
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:24,253
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WENT UP TO

1616
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:31,260
49, WAGES INCREASED 0.2.

1617
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,929
THINGS ARE NOT AS HUNKY-DORY AS

1618
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,165
287,000 MIGHT SUGGEST.

1619
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,967
BUT IT IS MAYBE A NORMAL

1620
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:40,669
150,000.

1621
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:41,437
IT IS NOTHING TO GET EXCITED

1622
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:42,137
ABOUT.

1623
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:47,509
>> BUT DOESN'T GET ANYBODY

1624
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,310
INTERESTED IN WHAT JANET YELLEN

1625
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,279
AND COMPANY ARE GOING TO DO? 

1626
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,681
DOES THAT CHANGE THE CALCULATION

1627
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:53,515
OF WHEN THEY MIGHT MOVE AT ALL

1628
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:53,916
FOR YOU? 

1629
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:58,487
BILL: I DON'T THINK SO.

1630
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:01,190
THERE IS THE BREXIT TO LOOK INTO

1631
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,659
THE EYES OF BREXIT, I GUESS.

1632
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,327
THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ITALIAN

1633
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:09,231
BANKS.

1634
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,466
DOES WITH THE ECB AND THE EU DO,

1635
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,367
PROBLEMS WITH U.K. THE PROPERTY,

1636
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:16,538
MUTUAL FUNDS.

1637
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:19,508
THERE IS A SENSE OF LIQUIDITY IN

1638
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:22,578
MARKETS, AND THE FED IS UPSET

1639
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:23,312
AND CONCERNED WITH MARKETS.

1640
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,447
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS

1641
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,649
DISCORD AROUND THE WORLD.

1642
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,518
I THINK THE FED STAYS WHERE IT

1643
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,087
IS.

1644
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:32,855
THEY WANT TO RAISE INTEREST

1645
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:33,255
RATES.

1646
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:36,492
THEY DID IT ONCE.

1647
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,326
IF THEY WANT TO HAVE US BELIEVE

1648
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,093
THEY WILL RAISE SEVERAL TIMES

1649
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:39,761
AND THEREFORE HAVE A PRETTY

1650
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:42,664
POSITIVE YIELD CURVE, WHICH WILL

1651
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:43,799
HELP BANKS AND INSURANCE

1652
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,701
COMPANIES, FOR THE MOST PART, I

1653
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:46,802
DON'T THINK THIS CHANGE IS MUCH.

1654
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,838
MICHAEL: YOUR CALLS FOR HOW MANY

1655
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,306
RATE MOVES THIS YEAR? 

1656
01:11:51,306 --> 01:11:56,979
BILL: THE MARKET CALLS FOR A

1657
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:57,713
HALF IN THE 12 MONTHS BEYOND

1658
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,647
THAT, ANOTHER HALF.

1659
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,083
12 BASIS POINTS EACH.

1660
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,919
THAT IS THE MARKET.

1661
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,121
THAT IS, I THINK THEY RAISE ONCE

1662
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:06,822
AND TRY TO GET EMPLOYMENT

1663
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,924
NUMBERS LIKE THIS, AND IF THEY

1664
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:12,861
GET THOSE WAGES UP, THEN PERHAPS

1665
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:13,762
THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CHANCE

1666
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:17,499
LATER IN THE YEAR.

1667
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,267
THEY REALLY DO WANT TO RAISE

1668
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:22,804
RATES, SOME OF THEM LIKE BULLARD

1669
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:23,605
AND EVANS HAVE A SENSE THEY NEED

1670
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,674
HIGHER INTEREST RATES IN A TO

1671
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,875
BALANCE OUT THEIR SAVINGS VERSUS

1672
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,944
THE INVESTMENT ELEMENT IN THE

1673
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:29,378
ECONOMY.

1674
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:34,016
TOM: IN THE MARKET COME BACK, IT

1675
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,384
IS STRONGER YEN AND THEN WEAKER

1676
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:38,620
YEN ON THE REPORT.

1677
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,454
AND THEN WE HAVE THE YEN COMING

1678
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:43,125
BACK AGAIN.

1679
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:46,061
WITHOUT QUESTION IN OUR

1680
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,196
LIFETIMES, THIS IS THE MOST

1681
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:48,997
PRIZED TO PERFECTION BOND MARKET

1682
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:49,665
WE'VE EVER SEEN.

1683
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:50,832
IS YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE CHANGED

1684
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:53,702
WHEN YOU SEE YIELDS? 

1685
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,171
THE YIELD GOES FROM 139 TO 131.

1686
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:59,141
THESE ARE SHOCKING YIELDS,

1687
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:02,177
SHOCKING BOND EVALUATIONS.

1688
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,046
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DAY-TO-DAY

1689
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:04,546
WITHIN THIS? 

1690
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:10,052
BILL: I GOT A HIT IS PRICED TO

1691
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:10,852
PERFECTION, I WILL CHANGE THAT

1692
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:13,455
IF YOU PERMIT MAY.

1693
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,123
-- I DON'T THINK IT IS PRICED TO

1694
01:13:15,123 --> 01:13:18,527
PERFECTION.

1695
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,129
SPONSORED NEGATIVE YIELD SPACE.

1696
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:24,466
IN GERMANY, THE ECB CANNOT

1697
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:28,537
PROVIDE 40% OF GERMAN BONDS

1698
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:29,371
BECAUSE THEY ARE YIELDING LESS

1699
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,539
THAN 40 BASIS POINTS, ALMOST

1700
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,542
EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE 40 YEAR

1701
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,444
JGB.

1702
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,413
SO IT IS ON THIRD THAT IT IS

1703
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:39,548
ABSURD.

1704
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:45,554
SO YOU DON'T BUY THOSE BONDS.

1705
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:47,956
THAT IS UP IN THE GERMAN BANKS

1706
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:48,757
AND INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO

1707
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,126
BUY BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT TO PUT

1708
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,128
THEIR MONEY SOMEWHERE.

1709
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:53,962
SO YOU SUBSTITUTE SOME KIND OF

1710
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:54,396
CERTAINTY.

1711
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:57,466
THE TRICK IN THIS BUSINESS IS TO

1712
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:58,266
BUY THE HIGHEST RETURN RELATIVE

1713
01:13:58,266 --> 01:14:00,836
TO RISK.

1714
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:01,703
I WOULD SAY EVERY ASSET CLASS IS

1715
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:02,270
AT RISK.

1716
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:05,574
THE QUESTION IS, WHICH IS AT

1717
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,776
LESS RISK.

1718
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,879
MY DOMINANT PREMISE IS, CENTRAL

1719
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:14,683
BANKS WILL DO WHAT THEY DO

1720
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,484
DESPITE THE FACT I DISAGREE WITH

1721
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:15,851
IT.

1722
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,586
IF THAT IS THE CASE, VOLATILITY

1723
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:24,126
OF CENTRAL BANKS' POSITIONS, THE

1724
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:24,926
VOLATILITY OF THE POLICY RATES

1725
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:25,927
AROUND THE WORLD WILL STAY

1726
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:27,196
RELATIVELY CONSTANT.

1727
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,063
SO YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

1728
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,866
THAT BY SELLING PERSONALITY

1729
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,601
AROUND IT.

1730
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:36,772
THAT WOULD INCLUDE BUYING MORE,

1731
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:37,506
SELLING OUTRIGHT OPTIONS.

1732
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,542
THAT WOULD INCLUDE BASICALLY

1733
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,743
STAYING IN YOUR IN ZONE SUMMING

1734
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,779
LIKE 1.4% ON A 10 YEAR LIKE 5%

1735
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,047
OR 6%.

1736
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:49,785
TOM: AND WHEN MR. GROSS SHELLS

1737
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,953
OPTIONS, THOSE DERIVATIVES,

1738
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:54,723
THOSE BRING IN THE INCOME

1739
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,559
STREAM.

1740
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,261
BILL GROSS, IF I LOOK INTO THE

1741
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:05,467
WEEKEND AND INTO JULY, INTO THE

1742
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:06,168
SECOND HALF, IS BILL GROSS

1743
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:06,935
LOOKING AT JANET YELLEN'S

1744
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:07,636
AMERICAN WORLD AND FOR THAT

1745
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:10,339
MATTER, A TROUBLED EUROPE AS AN

1746
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,542
EQUILIBRIUM OR DISEQUILIBRIUM SO

1747
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,310
GREAT THAT YOU NEED TO BE

1748
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,347
VIGILANT FOR THE SHOCKS? 

1749
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:24,386
BILL: ONE MUST BE PREPARED.

1750
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:28,023
IT IS HARD TO SAY.

1751
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,224
IT DOES NOT APPROACH A BLACK

1752
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,293
SWAN, BABY A GRACE WANT.

1753
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:41,436
-- -- MAYBE A GRAY SWAN. 

1754
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:43,472
WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IS

1755
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:46,441
GOING ON WITH CHINA, BUT I

1756
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,343
OBSERVED THE CHINESE STOCK

1757
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,112
MARKETS BASICALLY STAY LEVEL

1758
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:53,348
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NIGHT,

1759
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:53,982
EACH AND EVERY NIGHT.

1760
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,419
ONE HALF IS SUSPECTED, SOMETHING

1761
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,521
IS GOING ON THERE.

1762
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:03,492
THERE IS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM

1763
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:07,295
ALMOST EVERYWHERE, AND I, THAT

1764
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:07,763
IS THE KEY.

1765
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:11,767
A HIGHLY LIVERED WORLD, ANYTHING

1766
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:12,267
CAN SET IT OFF.

1767
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,970
TOM: LET ME ASK ONE MORE

1768
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:15,704
QUESTION BEFORE WE GO TO MY

1769
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:20,308
COLLEAGUE.

1770
01:16:20,308 --> 01:16:21,143
THERE WAS A BRILLIANT ARTICLE

1771
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:21,810
WRITTEN OVERNIGHT IN THE

1772
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,311
TELEGRAPH ABOUT CHINA EXPORTING

1773
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:25,647
THEIR DEFLATION OVER TO US.

1774
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:27,716
IS JANET YELLEN RUNNING A

1775
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:30,652
NON-ORTHODOX POLICY THAT SHE HAS

1776
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,387
GOT TO ACCEPT THE DISINFLATION

1777
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:35,457
FROM CHINA AND THE REST OF A

1778
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:42,730
TROUBLED ECONOMIC WORLD? 

1779
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:43,532
BILL: I THINK SHE DOES, AND IF

1780
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,299
SHE CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT

1781
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:45,000
RAISING INTEREST RATES, THAT

1782
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,203
WOULD MAKE IT EVEN WORSE.

1783
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:49,004
CHINA HAS BEEN DEVALUED THE 6%

1784
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,540
OR 7% OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR

1785
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,810
EIGHT MONTHS, 10% ANNUAL

1786
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,545
EXPORTING DEFLATION.

1787
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:57,846
EXPERTS DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

1788
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:58,513
THAT COULD BE THE CASE.

1789
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:03,118
IT MEANS WE CAN BUY CHINESE

1790
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:08,256
GOODS MUCH CHEAPER.

1791
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:09,057
THAT ERODES THE MANUFACTURING

1792
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:09,825
BASES, IT BECOMES IS

1793
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:10,292
COMPETITIVE.

1794
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,228
CHINA EXPORTS DEFLATION TO THE

1795
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,062
REST OF THE WORLD.

1796
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:20,402
YELLEN FIGHTS THAT, NOT WITH A

1797
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,203
STRONGER DOLLAR OR AN INTEREST

1798
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,138
RATE HIKE.

1799
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:26,241
HER TEMPERS, HER BEHAVIOR DOES

1800
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:26,808
TO SOME EXTENT.

1801
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:30,112
TOM: WE ARE SO EUROPE, EUROPE,

1802
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,713
EUROPE.

1803
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:32,614
GUESS WHAT? 

1804
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,415
CHINA AND A LITTLE BIT TO DO

1805
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,116
WITH IT.

1806
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,384
TOM: CHINA WILL COME BACK INTO

1807
01:17:36,384 --> 01:17:36,818
THE NEWS.

1808
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:41,656
MICHAEL: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT

1809
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:42,324
THE PRICE ACTION TODAY.

1810
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,425
IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE

1811
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,594
BEEN SEEING IN RECENT WEEKS.

1812
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,394
DOES THE NEW CURVE TELL US ANY

1813
01:17:46,394 --> 01:17:52,300
MUCH ABOUT THIS POINT? 

1814
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,637
IN THEORY, WE SHOULD SEE MORE

1815
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:56,404
SIGNS OF INFLATION AND NOT GO

1816
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:57,406
DOWN AS MUCH AS GOING UP.

1817
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:02,277
BILL: I THINK WE, THE OLD

1818
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,746
STANDARD, THAT IS THE POSSIBLE

1819
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,448
PROBLEM WITH THE OLD-TIME

1820
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:11,286
INVESTORS, NOT THAT I AM 72 --

1821
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:14,089
BUT I THINK THE OLD STANDARD IS

1822
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:19,594
WHEN THE 10-TO CURVE IS ON ZERO.

1823
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:23,298
IT HAS COME DOWN FROM 250 TWO

1824
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,633
NOW I THINK IT IS A READ ON 78

1825
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,635
OR 80.

1826
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:30,639
-- I THINK IT IS AROUND 78 OR

1827
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:31,006
80.

1828
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,374
THE PROCESS OF FLATTENING, THE

1829
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,475
MOMENTUM OF FLATTENING WILL MAKE

1830
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:37,979
THE DIFFERENCE, AND ONE HAS TO

1831
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:38,780
ADJUST TO THE HIGHLY LEVERED

1832
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,147
WORLD.

1833
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:42,317
IT IS A DIFFERENT WORLD WITH THE

1834
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,653
YELLED FLAT -- YIELD CURVE IS

1835
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:45,687
FLAT AT ZERO.

1836
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:47,455
I THINK THE FED BASICALLY HAS

1837
01:18:47,455 --> 01:18:50,692
BEEN TIGHTENING FOR THE LAST TWO

1838
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:51,059
YEARS.

1839
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,762
THEY HAVE TAKEN OFF THINGS.

1840
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:56,665
THEY HAVE WATCHED THE CURVE

1841
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:57,565
BETWEEN TWO AND 10, 30

1842
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:58,734
FLATTENING.

1843
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:03,772
THAT RESTRICTS FINANCIAL WITH

1844
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,874
PROFITABILITY, REGULATION, ALL

1845
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,142
OF THAT IN COMBINATION.

1846
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:07,976
THE FLATTENING YIELD CURVE IS

1847
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,412
NOT GOOD.

1848
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,647
EVEN WHERE IT IS, IT SUGGESTS A

1849
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:13,648
POTENTIAL FOR SLOWER GROWTH IN

1850
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,550
THE SESSION DOWN THE ROAD,

1851
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,053
ESPECIALLY ALONGSIDE A VERY

1852
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,855
STRONG DOLLAR.

1853
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:24,092
YOU CAN SEE AN INCREASE BY 20%

1854
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:24,960
TO 25% IN THE REST OF THE WORLD.

1855
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,464
MICHAEL: A VERY PROVOCATIVE

1856
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:30,298
PIECE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, GOT

1857
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,100
A LOT OF COMMENT.

1858
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,504
IT SUGGESTS THE BANKS ARE

1859
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:37,138
KEEPING RATES TOO LOW.

1860
01:19:37,138 --> 01:19:39,107
IF THEY WERE TO RISE, THANKS FOR

1861
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:43,812
MOBILITY -- BANKS PROFITABILITY

1862
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:44,612
WILL HAVE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS.

1863
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:47,082
UGLY PEOPLE, NOT YOU -- 

1864
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:51,486
TOM: WATCH YOURSELF OR YOU WILL

1865
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:52,187
NEVER COME ON AGAIN.

1866
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:55,223
MICHAEL: THEY ARE NOT MAKING ANY

1867
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:58,460
MONEY RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THEY

1868
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,160
CAN EARN ANYTHING ON THEIR

1869
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,328
SAVINGS.

1870
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,997
YOU GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK

1871
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:03,732
THAT WAY THAN TRYING TO

1872
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:04,532
INFLUENCE THE SPENDING BEHAVIOR

1873
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:05,033
OF MILLENNIALS.

1874
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:11,206
BILL: I THINK SO TOO, BUT THAT

1875
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:12,107
IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

1876
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:12,974
THE CENTRAL BANKS WORK OFF OF

1877
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,477
20, 30 YEAR MODELS.

1878
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,279
I THINK IT IS COMMONSENSICAL.

1879
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:22,684
THAT IS WHERE COMMON SENSE

1880
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:23,284
ENTERS THE EQUATION.

1881
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:24,219
IT WOULD BE NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF

1882
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:24,753
MORTGAGE RATES.

1883
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,521
CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF STOCK

1884
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:31,860
PRICES AT DISCOUNT RELATIVE TO

1885
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,594
THE GORDON DIVIDEND DISCOUNT

1886
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,862
MODEL.

1887
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:34,696
TO BASICALLY LOWER ITS PRICES,

1888
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:36,598
EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL.

1889
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:40,435
THE REAL PROBLEM GOING FORWARD

1890
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:41,236
IS SAVINGS AND THE ABILITY TO

1891
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,538
EARN SAVINGS.

1892
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:46,374
EXECUTIVE COMPANIES,

1893
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,643
PROFITABILITY AND MARGINS,

1894
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:51,746
CITIZEN INCOMES, EDUCATION AND

1895
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:52,213
RETIREMENT.

1896
01:20:52,213 --> 01:20:54,616
IT WAS TIME TO RAISE INTEREST

1897
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:58,954
RATES, 12 TO 18 MONTHS AGO.

1898
01:20:58,954 --> 01:20:59,955
I STILL THINK IT IS, BUT I DON'T

1899
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:00,688
THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1900
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:06,394
MICHAEL: YOU MENTIONED PENSION

1901
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:06,795
FUNDS.

1902
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:07,529
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS GOING

1903
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,496
TO BE A DISASTER.

1904
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:09,330
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU ARE GOING

1905
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,832
TO BE A PENSION FUND MANAGER? 

1906
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:15,670
BILL: IT IS A DISASTER.

1907
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:16,905
YOU TRY TO CHANGE THE RULES A

1908
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:17,238
BIT.

1909
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:18,740
THEY DO THAT, THEY CHANGE THE

1910
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:24,245
RULES AND MAKE THE RELEVANT RATE

1911
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:25,747
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN ORDER

1912
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:32,153
TO STRETCH OUT THE INEVITABLE.

1913
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:32,954
BUT YOU TRY TO CUT BENEFITS.

1914
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,789
THAT DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL.

1915
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,659
WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN INTO

1916
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,461
TROY AND CHICAGO.

1917
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,898
THE BEGICH'S -- BUDGETS GET HUNG

1918
01:21:43,898 --> 01:21:44,566
UP AS YOU TRY TO REDUCE

1919
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:44,999
BENEFITS.

1920
01:21:44,999 --> 01:21:51,206
SO IT BECOMES A LONG, DRY DOUBT

1921
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:52,040
BATTLE IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE

1922
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,876
MARGINAL PROFITABILITY OVER THE

1923
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,979
MARGINAL SURVIVABILITY OF A

1924
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:58,513
PENSION FUND.

1925
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:01,549
MOST OF THEM ARE LIKE 80% FUNDED

1926
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:04,486
BECAUSE OF LOWER INTEREST RATES

1927
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:06,187
AND THEIR DURATIONS HAVE NOT

1928
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,255
MATCHED THE DURATIONS OF

1929
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,523
LIABILITY.

1930
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:09,290
IT IS A LONG PROBLEM GOING

1931
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:10,058
FORWARD.

1932
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:12,393
ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO IT IS TO

1933
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:13,361
RAISE INTEREST RATES.

1934
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,130
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS.

1935
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:18,233
MICHAEL: WILL THIS UNLEASHED A

1936
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:21,369
WAVE OF BUYING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS

1937
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:22,937
CAPITULATE? 

1938
01:22:22,937 --> 01:22:23,972
IS THIS A FIGHT OVER 30? 

1939
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:28,276
BILL: THAT IS THE BUZZ IN THE

1940
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:28,676
PAPER.

1941
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:29,477
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT IS

1942
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:30,412
TRUE OR NOT.

1943
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:32,514
IT IS HARD TO IMMUNIZE YOUR

1944
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,582
PORTFOLIO.

1945
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:39,754
A 10 YEAR AT 1.4%.

1946
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,389
YOU WILL QUESTION YOUR SANITY

1947
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,490
BECAUSE A FEW YEARS AGO, IT WAS

1948
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:42,857
3%.

1949
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:45,660
BEFORE THAT, 5%.

1950
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,530
ANNUAL IMMUNIZE AT 1.4%.

1951
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:51,633
-- NOW YOU WILL IMMUNIZE AT

1952
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,535
1.4%.

1953
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,303
SO ALL HE IS IN GERMANY, THEIR

1954
01:22:55,303 --> 01:23:00,508
PORTFOLIO WAS NEGATIVE SPACE.

1955
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:05,580
-- ALLIANCE AND GERMANY, THERE

1956
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,716
PORTFOLIO IS NEGATIVE SPACE.

1957
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:11,152
THE REAL PROBLEM WOULD BE A RUSH

1958
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,754
TO ALL YOU RISK YOUR ASSETS TO

1959
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,289
PROVIDE A SEMBLANCE OF RETURN,

1960
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:17,726
RELATIVE TO LIABILITIES.

1961
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:22,130
TOM: YOU MENTIONED PROFIT

1962
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,698
COMPANIES IN THE EDITING THEM.

1963
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,934
THEY HAVE GOT TO STOP REDUCTIONS

1964
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,403
FROM THE VARIOUS FUNDS BECAUSE

1965
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:32,340
OF THE GAIN.

1966
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,174
I THINK WHAT ALL OF OUR VIEWERS

1967
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,842
AND LISTENERS WANT TO LEARN FROM

1968
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:35,543
BILL GROSS, INCLUDING THE

1969
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:38,079
INSTITUTIONAL LEAD LIKE MADAME

1970
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:38,947
LAGARDE WARNING YESTERDAY WITH

1971
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,882
THE IMF IS WHEN THIS ALICE IN

1972
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:44,619
WONDERLAND WORLD UNDERLINES.

1973
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:48,723
WILL IT UNWIND ALONG SMOOTH,

1974
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:49,991
PREDICTABLE, DAMPENED REACTION

1975
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:52,527
FUNDS, OR WILL IT UNWIND WITH

1976
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,863
UGLY JUMP CONDITIONS WHERE THERE

1977
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:56,397
IS REAL DAMAGE? 

1978
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:56,998
WHICH WAY DO YOU GO? 

1979
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:01,169
BILL: POLICY MAKERS ARE TRYING

1980
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:01,970
TO MAKE IT THROUGH THERE.

1981
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,572
IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS,

1982
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:07,842
MONETARY STIMULATION, CHANGING

1983
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:10,045
AND RULES AT THE LAST MINUTE.

1984
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,915
WE HAVE GOT GERMANY BASICALLY

1985
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:19,754
SUGGESTING A BAIL IN COULD BE A

1986
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,956
BAIL OUT FOR ITALIAN BANKS UNDER

1987
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:26,994
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

1988
01:24:26,994 --> 01:24:27,829
WE'LL GET THE U.K. PROPERTY

1989
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:28,663
MUTUAL FUNDS BASICALLY CHANGING

1990
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:29,697
THEIR UNIT VALUE.

1991
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:32,133
THE WORTH OF THE FUND BY 15

1992
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:36,170
OVERNIGHT TO PREVENT MONEY

1993
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,239
COMING OUT, WHICH IS INCREDIBLE.

1994
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,342
IT MAKES AN INVESTOR SAY, WHAT

1995
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:41,943
IS MY MONEY WORTH? 

1996
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:45,313
TOM: THERE IS A SMALLTIME BOND

1997
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:48,383
MANAGER ON THE WEST COAST.

1998
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:48,916
REMEMBER HIM? 

1999
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:52,854
HIS NAME IS GUN LOCK, AND HE

2000
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:56,224
FOCUSES ON DEUTSCHE BANK AS A

2001
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,859
PROXY FOR THE EUROPEAN BANKS.

2002
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,061
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE POSITION

2003
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:01,095
DEUTSCHE BANK IS IN OR IF THEY

2004
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:04,132
HAVE TO STRUCTURE COCOA HYBRIDS

2005
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:06,134
FOR THE ITALIAN BANKS TO BE THE

2006
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,303
KIND OF JUMP CONDITION THAT

2007
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:12,140
LEADS TO REAL INSTABILITY? 

2008
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,243
BILL: IT COULD BE.

2009
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,879
WE HAVE KNOWN DEUTSCHE BANK IS A

2010
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:21,616
WEAK LINK IN THE BANKING SYSTEM

2011
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,719
FOR A LONG TIME.

2012
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,387
WITH THE STOCK PRICES, IT SINKS

2013
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,222
TO 11, 10.

2014
01:25:28,222 --> 01:25:33,327
THERE MUST BE A HOLE SOMEWHERE.

2015
01:25:33,327 --> 01:25:34,162
DEUTSCHE BANK IS OVER HUNDREDS

2016
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:34,896
OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

2017
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:36,097
DERIVATIVES, SOME OF WHICH THEN

2018
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:37,465
CLOSED OUT, BUT WE DON'T KNOW

2019
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:40,435
WHAT IS LEFT.

2020
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:44,272
SO THE DEUTSCHE BANK WAS THE

2021
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:46,274
BASTION OF GERMAN BANKING VERSUS

2022
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,009
A LONG TIME, BUT IT GOT CAUGHT

2023
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:51,679
IN THE RUSH TO DERIVATIVE MESS.

2024
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:56,684
NOW IS THE PROBLEM.

2025
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:58,419
CERTAIN ITALIAN BANKS, DEUTSCHE

2026
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:01,589
BANK, THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE FOR

2027
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:02,557
THE POLICYMAKERS AS THEY CHANGE

2028
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,592
THE RULES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT

2029
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:07,662
THEM, ALL OF THESE THINGS,

2030
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:10,865
REDUCED CONFIDENCE IN MARKETS IS

2031
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,634
INVESTORS KNOW THE ARTIFICIAL

2032
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,669
PRICES ARE THE THEME OF THE DAY.

2033
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,573
TOM: ONE THING YOU HAVE BEEN

2034
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:19,640
COMFORTABLE WITH IN RECENT

2035
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,043
QUARTERS HAS BEEN MEXICO.

2036
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,711
IF I SEE A BREXIT KNOCK ON

2037
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,481
EFFECT WITH THE CONTAGION IN

2038
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:27,882
EUROPE GOING OVER TO A MEXICAN

2039
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:30,852
PESO FROM 18 TO A WEAKER 19, WHO

2040
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,688
KNOWS WHERE IT IS GOING, DOES

2041
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,057
EVEN BILL GROSS HAVE TO STOP

2042
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:36,858
DOING NORMAL PROCEDURES BECAUSE

2043
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,894
OF THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT OF

2044
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:40,628
BREXIT IN EUROPE OVER TO AN

2045
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:41,662
EMERGING MARKET PROXY LIKE

2046
01:26:41,662 --> 01:26:42,730
MEXICO? 

2047
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,900
BILL: I THINK THAT IS A FAIR

2048
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,069
IMPRESSION.

2049
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:48,936
MEXICO IS A PROXY FOR EMERGING

2050
01:26:48,936 --> 01:26:52,740
MARKETS.

2051
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,309
IT IS ABREAST OF THE ART

2052
01:26:55,309 --> 01:26:55,910
EMERGING MARKETS.

2053
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:56,611
IT HAS HALF THE DDP OF THE

2054
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:57,845
UNITED STATES, BUT MEXICO AND

2055
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:00,782
THE PESO ARE TAKEN ON THE CHIN

2056
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:04,152
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.

2057
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,019
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF

2058
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:05,954
POLICY? 

2059
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:08,923
WE SAW LAST WEEK THE CENTRAL

2060
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:12,927
BANK RAISED INTEREST RATES TO

2061
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,062
SUPPORT THE PESO TO SOME EXTENT.

2062
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,964
SO YOU CAN EXPECT VOLATILITY.

2063
01:27:16,964 --> 01:27:19,767
I WILL POINT OUT THE MEXICAN

2064
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:23,204
TEN-YEAR TIP, THE LINKER, THE

2065
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:26,874
INFLATION IN THE BOND, IT YIELDS

2066
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:30,411
3% REAL AS OPPOSED TO 35 BASIS

2067
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:34,682
POINTS IN THE UNITED STATES.

2068
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:35,316
IT IS HUGE SPREAD.

2069
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:36,184
YOU CAN ADJUST FOR CREDIT

2070
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:39,254
QUALITY, BUT IT IS A VALUE

2071
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:42,257
ABSENT, A RUSH TO SAFETY.

2072
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:45,593
MICHAEL: WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF

2073
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:46,360
PEOPLE RUSHING INTO CORPORATE

2074
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,362
BONDS AS ANYBODY TRIES TO GET

2075
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:52,400
SOME SORT OF YIELD HERE.

2076
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,168
HIS THAT A SMART MOVE? 

2077
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,670
ARE PEOPLE TAKING TOO MUCH OF A

2078
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:56,604
RISK AND USING IT AS A PROXY FOR

2079
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,406
SOVEREIGNS? 

2080
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:03,611
BILL: IT IS A QUICK FORMULA.

2081
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,780
YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SPREAD

2082
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,614
IS, YOU PAY HIGH YIELD AT 450

2083
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,417
BASIS POINTS TO FIGURE OF THE

2084
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:11,419
ANNUALIZED DEFAULTS ON THE

2085
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:11,853
RECOVERY.

2086
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:16,591
4% OF THE RECOVERY OF 50%.

2087
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:18,826
THAT TAKES TWO POINTS OFF THE

2088
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:21,796
4.5, SO THAT LEAVES YOU 2.5%.

2089
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:25,867
YOU HAVE TREASURIES.

2090
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:26,968
THAT IS NOT A BAD DEAL, BUT IT

2091
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:27,802
IS NOT THE DEAL INVESTORS THINK

2092
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:28,503
WE ARE GOING TO GET.

2093
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,671
AND WE HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE WE ARE

2094
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:32,840
TALKING ABOUT, THOSE SPREADS ARE

2095
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:33,841
GOING TO WIDEN OUT.

2096
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:34,676
IT IS OBVIOUS WHEN INTEREST

2097
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:38,546
RATES ARE ZERO AND NEGATIVE BUT

2098
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:41,015
EVERYTHING IS TIED TOGETHER.

2099
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:41,883
THE KNEE BONE AND THE HIP BONE

2100
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:45,820
AND JUNK BONDS AND NEGATIVE

2101
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:49,991
INTEREST BONDS ARE TIED

2102
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:50,424
TOGETHER.

2103
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:51,158
YOU MUST THINK THE HIGH-YIELD

2104
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:53,661
BOND AREA IS ARTIFICIALLY

2105
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,731
PRICED AND UNDERWRITTEN HIS AND

2106
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:59,133
CIRCUMSTANCES.

2107
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:01,869
-- IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

2108
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:07,441
MICHAEL: ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES

2109
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:09,544
OF CORPORATE, OR JUST

2110
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:12,013
HIGH-YIELD? 

2111
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:16,984
BILL: THERE ARE CD X, AN INDEX

2112
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:18,920
OF HIGH-YIELD BONDS.

2113
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:25,259
IG CDX, INVESTMENT-GRADE BONDS.

2114
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,028
THEY ARE EASILY TRADED.

2115
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:33,067
THE IG CDX ARE ABOUT 125.

2116
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:36,837
SO WHEN YOU BUY PROTECTION

2117
01:29:36,837 --> 01:29:39,874
VERSUS SELLING, THAT YOU ARE

2118
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:45,179
GIVING UP THAT CARRY.

2119
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:45,880
BUT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A

2120
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,582
WIDENING OF SPREADS.

2121
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:48,449
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN BOTH OF

2122
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:48,983
THOSE MARKETS.

2123
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:52,987
MICHAEL: THE COST OF MARKET

2124
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,155
MONEY, EFFECTIVELY 37 BASIS

2125
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,924
POINTS, OR CORPORATE BONDS THE

2126
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:57,858
CHANNEL FOR MONETARY POLICY NOW?

2127
01:30:02,429 --> 01:30:05,166
BILL: THEY CERTAINLY ARE

2128
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:11,805
BEGINNING TO BE WITH THE ECB.

2129
01:30:11,805 --> 01:30:13,241
STOCKS OF THE ASSET CLASS OF THE

2130
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,976
DAY WITH THE SWISS NATIONAL

2131
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:15,743
BANK, WE FOUND UP.

2132
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:19,180
THEY HAVE $500 BILLION WORTH OF

2133
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,314
STOCKS AROUND THE WORLD,

2134
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:23,117
INCLUDING JOHNSON & JOHNSON.

2135
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:23,684
IT IS STAGGERING.

2136
01:30:23,684 --> 01:30:28,155
WE HAVE KNOWN THE JAPANESE BUY

2137
01:30:28,155 --> 01:30:28,923
STOCKS, BUT I NEVER KNEW THE

2138
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:32,426
SWISS NATIONAL BANK BOUGHT

2139
01:30:32,426 --> 01:30:32,827
STOCKS.

2140
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:33,594
IT IS LIKE A SOVEREIGN WEALTH

2141
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:33,928
FUND.

2142
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:38,332
AND SO THIS ENTIRE MARKET IS

2143
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:41,135
DISTORTED BY CASH FLOWS THAT

2144
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:41,702
NEVER HAVE BEEN.

2145
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:45,273
TOM: I LOOK AT THE SWISS FRANC

2146
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:50,478
AND STERLING HAS A SAFE HAVEN

2147
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:54,782
PROXY FOR THIS UNITED KINGDOM

2148
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:55,182
STUFF.

2149
01:30:55,182 --> 01:30:55,916
ALL OF THE WORLD WOULD LIKE TO

2150
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:57,452
KNOW THE BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

2151
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,320
WORLD WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT

2152
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,256
YOU ARE THINKING IN THE DRAMA OF

2153
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:02,857
THE BREXIT VOTE.

2154
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:04,425
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING AS YOU

2155
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:08,129
SAW THE UNITED KINGDOM SHIFT TO

2156
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,163
LEAVE VERSUS THE PRESUMED

2157
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:14,468
REMAIN? 

2158
01:31:14,468 --> 01:31:15,302
BILL:BILL: I WAS WATCHING THAT

2159
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:15,770
OVERNIGHT.

2160
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,638
WHAT I WAS WATCHING, I HAD SOME

2161
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,307
OPTIONS IN U.S. TREASURIES,

2162
01:31:20,307 --> 01:31:24,946
CALLS AND PUTS.

2163
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:25,780
INITIALLY, THE U.S. TREASURIES

2164
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,248
WERE DECLINING IN PRICE,

2165
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,250
DECLINING TO MUCH.

2166
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,486
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, AS THE

2167
01:31:32,486 --> 01:31:36,057
BREXIT WAS WINNING, TREASURIES

2168
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:36,791
WENT AND WE ARE GOING UP TOO

2169
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:37,725
MUCH.

2170
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,327
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL AS

2171
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:41,996
MUCH VOLATILITY AS HAPPENED ON

2172
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:42,463
THAT NIGHT.

2173
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:43,164
IT WAS A LONG NIGHT FOR ME.

2174
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,366
IT TURNED OUT VERY WELL, BUT

2175
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:48,536
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH A

2176
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:51,239
SUDDEN CHANGE.

2177
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:52,073
THERE ARE SO MANY POSITIONS, SO

2178
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,008
MUCH LEVERAGE, CURRENCY WISE AS

2179
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:57,812
YOU POINT OUT EVERY FIVE MINUTES

2180
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:01,449
ON YOUR PROGRAM.

2181
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:02,149
I THINK THAT IS GOOD.

2182
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,885
THERE ARE HUGE CURRENCY

2183
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:05,987
POSITIONS THAT HAVE TO BE

2184
01:32:05,987 --> 01:32:08,122
ALLOWED AND REBALANCED.

2185
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:08,856
THERE ARE HUGE POSITIONS IN

2186
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:12,026
TERMS OF CREDIT AND TREASURIES.

2187
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:15,963
HUGE POSITIONS ACROSS THE U.S.

2188

THE EARNINGS RELEASES.

2329
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:52,646
THE DOLLAR WILL BE A PART OF

2330
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:53,080
THAT.

2331
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,715

THOSE WORDS ARE CRINGE WORTHY,

2335

2339
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:10,731
THEY WOULD RATHER OVERPROMISE

2348
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:35,389
THE DRAWDOWN EXPECTATION IS

2349
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:36,256
DRIVEN BY THE FACT LOOK AT

01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:38,058

RIGHT TIME TO BE SELLING BONDS,

2359
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:58,612
MIKE ANSWER WOULD BE, NO.

2360
01:41:58,612 --> 01:42:00,247
THE DRIVER OF A BOND IS NOT

2361
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:02,316

01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:21,768
I WOULD SAY THE MARKETS WOULD

2370
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:22,569
REACT SOMEWHAT TO THIS, BUT IT

2371
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:27,407
LOOKS RELATIVELY MODEST AND WILL

2372
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:28,208
FADE RELATIVELY QUICKLY AS WELL.

2373
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:32,713
JON: WE ARE GOING BACK UP AND

2374
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:33,113
YIELDS.

2375
01:42:33,113 --> 01:42:33,680
WE SAW A LITTLE BIT.

2376
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,517
A COUPLE OF BASIS POINTS.

2377
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:37,684
THOSE IN THREE POSITIONS, ARE

2378
01:42:37,684 --> 01:42:38,552
YOU TACTICAL ABOUT THAT? 

2379
01:42:38,552 --> 01:42:43,457
>> THE BATTLE YOU IN THE BOND

2380
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:44,858
MARKET IS REALLY GOVERNMENT --

2381
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:46,593
VALUE IN THE BOND MARKET IS

2382
01:42:46,593 --> 01:42:48,729
REALLY IN GOVERNMENT BONDS.

2383
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:50,764
WE WERE BETTER DOING HIGH-GRADE

2384
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:51,131
BONDS.

2385
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:51,899
AT LEAST YOU OWN SOME INCOME.

2386
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,767
IT IS BETTER THAN WHAT YOU CAN

2387
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:56,336
GET IN GOVERNMENT BONDS, WHERE

2388
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:57,437
HALF THE WORLD IS NEGATIVE.

2389
01:42:57,437 --> 01:43:00,607
DAVID: I WANT TO GO TO STANFORD

2390
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:02,042
UNIVERSITY.

2391
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:02,809
ONE THING WE HAVE NOT TALKED

2392
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:06,480
ABOUT IS, WE HAD THE IRONY OF

2393
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,247
BOTH THE JOBS NUMBER GOING UP,

2394
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:11,451
NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED, BUT

2395
01:43:11,451 --> 01:43:13,020
ALSO UNEMPLOYMENT GOING UP.

2396
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,323
WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THAT? 

2397
01:43:16,323 --> 01:43:17,124
>> THOSE NUMBERS ARE VOLATILE

2398
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:19,259
FOR ONE THING.

2399
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:19,960
YOU GET MONTH-TO-MONTH

2400
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:20,427
VARIATIONS.

2401
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:23,630
THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON WE

2402
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:24,464
TAKE FROM THIS PARTICULAR REPORT

2403
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:28,001
IS THESE THINGS BOUNCE AROUND A

2404
01:43:28,001 --> 01:43:28,335
LOT.

2405
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:29,102
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE JOBS

2406
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:34,040
GOING FROM 11,000 ONE MONTH TO

2407
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:34,541
287 THOUSAND 

2408
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,943
AND HAVING APPEALED REAL

2409
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:39,146
REFLECTION -- AND HAVING THAT BE

2410
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:40,013
A REAL REFLECTION OF A NUMBER.

2411
01:43:40,013 --> 01:43:46,353
YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT 147, THE

2412
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:47,087
THREE MONTH MOVING AVERAGE.

2413
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:48,121
THAT IS A GOOD NUMBER.

2414
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:49,556
IT IS JUST ABOUT CONSISTENT WITH

2415
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:50,824
WHERE WE WANT TO BE TO KEEP UP

2416
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:53,827
WITH POLITICS IT -- POPULATION

2417
01:43:53,827 --> 01:43:55,929
GROWTH.

2418
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:58,031
SO JUST TO STAY EVEN, IT IS

2419
01:43:58,031 --> 01:44:02,068
ABOUT 129,000 A MONTH.

2420
01:44:02,068 --> 01:44:02,836
THAT WOULD KEEP US CONSTANT IN

2421
01:44:02,836 --> 01:44:05,038
TERMS OF ADDING ENOUGH JOBS TO

2422
01:44:05,038 --> 01:44:06,707
KEEP UP WITH THE POPULATION

2423
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:07,140
GROWTH.

2424
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:07,774
THAT IS WHERE WE ARE.

2425
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:12,078
THE SLIGHT UPTAKE IN EMPLOYMENT

2426
01:44:12,078 --> 01:44:12,712
IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

2427
01:44:12,712 --> 01:44:15,215
TO ME, THOSE NUMBERS STILL

2428
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:17,384
SUGGEST THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT

2429
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:19,019
AN ECONOMY THAT IS NEAR PEAK

2430
01:44:19,019 --> 01:44:21,321
EMPLOYMENT.

2431
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:23,757
AND SO, IF THAT WERE THE CASE,

2432
01:44:23,757 --> 01:44:24,591
IF WE TURN TO THESE NUMBERS AND

2433
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:25,992
WE BELIEVE THESE NUMBERS, WE

2434
01:44:25,992 --> 01:44:29,196
SAY, WE ARE NEAR THE PEAK.

2435
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:29,963
WE HAVE BASICALLY RECOVERED.

2436
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:32,633
WAGE GROWTH PICKED UP A LITTLE

2437
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:36,536
BIT, OUR ESTIMATE IS 34.4%.

2438
01:44:36,536 --> 01:44:39,139
THAT IS KIND OF HIGH WHEN YOUR

2439
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:40,774
NEW THE TOP OF THE BUSINESS

2440
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:41,208
CYCLE.

2441
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:42,342
EVERYTHING LOOKS RIGHT.

2442
01:44:42,342 --> 01:44:44,578
ONE PROBLEM, UNEMPLOYMENT IS

2443
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:45,011
VERY LOW.

2444
01:44:45,011 --> 01:44:45,745
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.

2445
01:44:45,745 --> 01:44:48,582
ALIX: SO HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE

2446
01:44:48,582 --> 01:44:49,549
FROM FULL EMPLOYMENT? 

2447
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:52,752
>> USING THE EMPLOYMENT RATE, WE

2448
01:44:52,752 --> 01:44:55,655
ARE DOWN 4 MILLION OR 5 MILLION

2449
01:44:55,655 --> 01:44:59,026
JOBS.

2450
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:00,127
A LOT, OBVIOUSLY.

2451
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:01,027
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DEMOGRAPHIC,

2452
01:45:01,027 --> 01:45:02,696
HOW MUCH IS REFLECTING THINGS

2453
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:06,099
THAT ARE REAL IN THE ECONOMY? 

2454
01:45:06,099 --> 01:45:06,900
MY CALCULATIONS SUGGEST THAT

2455
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,169
EVEN IF WE CORRECT FOR

2456
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:10,036
DEMOGRAPHICS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

2457
01:45:10,036 --> 01:45:13,306
CURRENT HIRING RATE, THE ON

2458
01:45:13,306 --> 01:45:14,674
EMPLOYMENT RATE, RATHER THAN

2459
01:45:14,674 --> 01:45:17,878
BEING 4.8%, 4.9%, WHICH IS

2460
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:22,782
PROBABLY HIDE -- FIVE.

2461
01:45:22,782 --> 01:45:24,951
MORE LIKE 5.8%.

2462
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:27,087
THAT FEELS MORE CONSISTENT WITH

2463
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:28,588
THE KIND OF ECONOMY WE HAVE

2464
01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:30,090
RIGHT NOW WITH GROWTH RATES WE

2465
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:34,694
HAVE SEEN, WAGE GROWTH, AND

2466
01:45:34,694 --> 01:45:35,195
EMPLOYMENT.

2467
01:45:35,195 --> 01:45:35,996
THAT IS PROBABLY THE CORRECT ON

2468
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,697
IMPLEMENT RATE, BUT --

2469
01:45:37,697 --> 01:45:40,033
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, BUT WE HAVE

2470
01:45:40,033 --> 01:45:44,971
COME A LONG WAY FROM 10%

2471
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:45,505
UNEMPLOYMENT.

2472
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:48,275
NO DOUBT WE RECOVERED ON THE

2473
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:48,909
GROUND WE HAD LOST.

2474
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:53,046
DAVID: PICKING UP ON WHAT ED IS

2475
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:53,680
TALKING ABOUT, THAT

2476
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:56,016
UNDEREMPLOYMENT NUMBER, ACCOUNT

2477
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:58,185
FOR THE FACT WE ARE NOT SEEING

2478
01:45:58,185 --> 01:46:02,255
ROBUST WAGE GROWTH? 

2479
01:46:02,255 --> 01:46:04,291
EVEN 0.2% IS NOT VERY ROBUST.

2480
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:08,228
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND THAT IS WHY

2481
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:10,297
THE FED IS FOCUSED ON WAGE

2482
01:46:10,297 --> 01:46:10,964
GROWTH FAR MORE THAN ON

2483
01:46:10,964 --> 01:46:12,733
IMPLEMENT NUMBER ITSELF.

2484
01:46:12,733 --> 01:46:14,434
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER IS VERY

2485
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:16,403
CONTINGENT ON PARTICIPATION

2486
01:46:16,403 --> 01:46:17,103
RATES AND A LOT OF OTHER

2487
01:46:17,103 --> 01:46:18,505
FACTORS.

2488
01:46:18,505 --> 01:46:21,474
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS

2489
01:46:21,474 --> 01:46:22,576
GOING TO BE IN WAGE GROWTH.

2490
01:46:22,576 --> 01:46:27,514
IF IT IS NOT THERE, WE ARE NOT

2491
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:28,281
AS STRESSED THE FROM AND ON

2492
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:29,015
APPOINTMENT STANDPOINT AS WE

2493
01:46:29,015 --> 01:46:32,886
MAKE BE BASED ON NUMBERS YOU SEE

2494
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:33,553
IN A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.

WITH US AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY.

2497
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:42,495
I SHOULD POINT OUT THE 10 YEAR

2498
01:46:42,495 --> 01:46:43,497
YIELD GOING NEGATIVE NOW.

2499
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:45,365
1.37%.

2500
01:46:45,365 --> 01:46:46,166
THAT BOND SELLOFF NOT CONTINUING

2501
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:49,002
FOR THE 10 YEAR.

MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AS

01:47:30,844 --> 01:47:31,311
THEY COULD.

THIS.

2531

THERE IS A TEMPORARY HALT IN THE

PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

2546
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:13,586
HILLARY CLINTON HAS CANCELED AN

WE WILL GET YOU VERY QUICKLY.

2625
01:53:24,564 --> 01:53:25,365
MY FIRST QUESTION IS TO MICHAEL

2626
01:53:25,365 --> 01:53:27,867
MCKAY.

2627
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:28,668
HE SAID TO BILL GROSS, WHAT

2628
01:53:28,668 --> 01:53:31,270
WOULD IT TAKE TO WATCH THE NEXT

2629
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:32,038
BAD NEWS CONFERENCE, GIVEN THE

2630
01:53:32,038 --> 01:53:35,108
MARKET IS SET TO DO ANYTHING FOR

2631
01:53:35,108 --> 01:53:37,544
TWO YEARS? 

2632
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:39,478
IS ENOUGH TO PAY MORE ATTENTION?

2633
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:46,152
>> NOT REALLY, THE ECONOMIC,

2634
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:47,420
BACKWARD ECONOMIC DATA HAS BEEN

2635
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:47,854
STEADY.

2636
01:53:47,854 --> 01:53:49,589
BUT THAT IS NOT THE DRIVER.

2637
01:53:49,589 --> 01:53:50,356
THE DRIVER A BOND MARKETS AND

2638
01:53:50,356 --> 01:53:52,525
WHAT THE FED IS GOING TO DO IS

2639
01:53:52,525 --> 01:53:53,726
WHAT HAPPENS ON A GLOBAL BASIS.

2640
01:53:53,726 --> 01:53:59,232
AND THE NEWS IS CLEAR, WE ARE

2641
01:53:59,232 --> 01:54:00,033
STILL FULL OF BREXIT RELATED

2642
01:54:00,033 --> 01:54:00,800
UNCERTAINTY, AND THAT WILL BE

2643
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,835
THE DRIVER OF CONDITIONS IN THE

2644
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:02,702
U.S..

2645
01:54:02,702 --> 01:54:06,672
DAVID: SO PROFESSOR FROM

2646
01:54:06,672 --> 01:54:10,877
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, AS WE LOOK

2647
01:54:10,877 --> 01:54:11,677
AT HIS JOBS IN A LARGER CONTEXT

2648
01:54:11,677 --> 01:54:12,812
OF WHERE THE ECONOMY IS NOW

2649
01:54:12,812 --> 01:54:14,013
WHERE IT IS HEADING, DO YOU SEE

2650
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:14,814
GROWTH? 

2651
01:54:14,814 --> 01:54:20,887
>> I ALWAYS USE THE MARKET AS MY

2652
01:54:20,887 --> 01:54:21,621
BEST INDICATOR OF GROWTH.

2653
01:54:21,621 --> 01:54:22,688
THE MARKET IS TELLING US THAT WE

2654
01:54:22,688 --> 01:54:24,824
ARE LOOKING AT THE NEXT FOUR

2655
01:54:24,824 --> 01:54:30,096
QUARTERS OF ABOUT 2% TO 2.5

2656
01:54:30,096 --> 01:54:30,496
PERCENT.

2657
01:54:30,496 --> 01:54:32,265
IF YOU BELIEVE MARKET NUMBERS,

2658
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:33,066
WHAT IS GOING ON, THAT IS KIND

2659
01:54:33,066 --> 01:54:35,235
OF WHERE WE ARE.

2660
01:54:35,235 --> 01:54:38,004
THAT WILL BE CONSISTENT WHERE WE

2661
01:54:38,004 --> 01:54:38,738
STAND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE

2662
01:54:38,738 --> 01:54:39,138
RECOVERY.

2663
01:54:39,138 --> 01:54:40,139
PICKING UP ON CHRISTIANS POINT

2664
01:54:40,139 --> 01:54:44,644
ABOUT THE FED AND THEIR

2665
01:54:44,644 --> 01:54:45,478
SITUATION, THEY ARE IN A BIND

2666
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:45,912
RIGHT NOW.

2667
01:54:45,912 --> 01:54:48,281
THE REASON IS IF YOU BELIEVE

2668
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:49,082
THESE NUMBERS, THE JOB NUMBERS,

2669
01:54:49,082 --> 01:54:51,584
GROWTH NUMBERS, EVERYTHING GOING

2670
01:54:51,584 --> 01:54:52,452
ON IN THE ECONOMY, IT LOOKS LIKE

2671
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:55,354
THE RECOVERY HAS KIND OF PLAYED

2672
01:54:55,354 --> 01:54:57,190
ITSELF OUT.

2673
01:54:57,190 --> 01:55:00,426
WE ARE AT A PEAK.

2674
01:55:00,426 --> 01:55:01,227
HOPEFULLY IT IS THE PLATEAU AND

2675
01:55:01,227 --> 01:55:03,363
WE ARE NOT GOING BACK DOWN.

2676
01:55:03,363 --> 01:55:06,699
WHEN DOES THE FED RAISE RATES? 

2677
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:09,602
THEY DO NOT RAISE THE MAP A PEAK

2678
01:55:09,602 --> 01:55:09,936
.

2679
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:10,636
THEY RAISE RATES DURING THE

2680
01:55:10,636 --> 01:55:11,437
RECOVERY.

2681
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:14,540
IF THAT IS ESSENTIALLY OVER, AND

2682
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,241
THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE THE

2683
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:18,111
RECOVERY IS OVER AND WE ARE IN

2684
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:19,846
AN UNSURE PHASE, THE FED IS IN A

2685
01:55:19,846 --> 01:55:20,213
BIND.

2686
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:21,614
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO BE

2687
01:55:21,614 --> 01:55:22,115
RAISING RATES.

2688
01:55:22,115 --> 01:55:22,915
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT TWO TO

2689
01:55:22,915 --> 01:55:26,319
THREE YEARS AGO, AND NOW THEY

2690
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:27,220
ARE STUCK AND HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

2691
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:27,987
HOW TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION.

2692
01:55:27,987 --> 01:55:31,357
THAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT JANET

2693
01:55:31,357 --> 01:55:32,758
AND OTHER FED GOVERNORS FACE

2694
01:55:32,758 --> 01:55:35,094
RIGHT NOW.

2695
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:36,829
WE WILL SEE HOW THEY HANDLE IT.

2696
01:55:36,829 --> 01:55:39,799
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE KIND OF

2697
01:55:39,799 --> 01:55:40,767
BEHIND THE CURVE ON THIS ONE.

2698
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:44,137
DAVID: SO THIS WAS THE FISCAL

2699
01:55:44,137 --> 01:55:45,838
STIMULUS, AND WE ALWAYS WANT

2700
01:55:45,838 --> 01:55:48,308
THAT.

2701
01:55:48,308 --> 01:55:48,908
IT NEVER HAPPENS.

2702
01:55:48,908 --> 01:55:49,842
IS IT POSSIBLE WITH TAX REFORM? 

2703
01:55:49,842 --> 01:55:55,081
>> IT IS POSSIBLE.

2704
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:56,048
THE REAL QUESTION IS, IS IT

2705
01:55:56,048 --> 01:55:58,351
LIKELY? 

2706
01:55:58,351 --> 01:55:59,218
IT IS PROBABLY LESS LIKELY THAT

2707
01:55:59,218 --> 01:56:02,355
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE.

2708
01:56:02,355 --> 01:56:03,189
THE FISCAL POLICY IS SOMETHING

2709
01:56:03,189 --> 01:56:07,927
WE TALK ABOUT A LOT, BUT GIVEN

2710
01:56:07,927 --> 01:56:08,761
THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, IT IS

2711
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:09,562
UNLIKELY WE HAVE SEEN MUCH OF

2712
01:56:09,562 --> 01:56:09,862
IT.

2713
01:56:09,862 --> 01:56:12,165
ALIX: WHAT TURNS MORE, CREDIT OR

2714
01:56:12,165 --> 01:56:12,999
EQUITIES? 

2715
01:56:12,999 --> 01:56:17,103
>> CREDIT.

2716
01:56:17,103 --> 01:56:19,405
GROWTH SLOWS DOWN AND VALUATIONS

2717
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:19,839
ARE RICH.

2718
01:56:19,839 --> 01:56:22,241
CREDIT CAN BE CARRIED.

2719
01:56:22,241 --> 01:56:25,344
WHEN RATES ARE LOW, SPREAD

2720
01:56:25,344 --> 01:56:26,112
WIDENING POTENTIAL GOES DOWN

2721
01:56:26,112 --> 01:56:29,282
BECAUSE OF THIS SLOWER THING.

2722
01:56:29,282 --> 01:56:30,183
CREDIT IS THE BEST CHOICE.

2723
01:56:30,183 --> 01:56:33,219

THEY ARE TAKING A MOMENT OF

01:56:36,155 --> 01:56:43,495

ED LOZIER IS STILL WITH US FROM

2736
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:06,112
STANFORD.

2737
01:58:06,112 --> 01:58:07,013
WHEN WE DO CONTINUE TO GET THESE

2738
01:58:07,013 --> 01:58:09,749
STRONGER JOB NUMBERS, DOES THERE

2739
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:10,983
COME A POINT WHEN THE FED IS

2740
01:58:10,983 --> 01:58:13,886
BEHIND IN THE CURVE, IF THEY

2741
01:58:13,886 --> 01:58:15,054
SAID IT WAS MAY, THEY WOULD TAKE

2742
01:58:15,054 --> 01:58:18,891
THAT RATE HIKE OFF THE TABLE? 

2743
01:58:18,891 --> 01:58:23,629
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

2744
01:58:23,629 --> 01:58:24,363
THE FED, THAT IS THE BEST

2745
01:58:24,363 --> 01:58:26,032
INDICATOR.

2746
01:58:26,032 --> 01:58:28,968
WHAT SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN

2747
01:58:28,968 --> 01:58:29,702
DOING, WHEN SHOULD THEY HAVE

2748
01:58:29,702 --> 01:58:31,471
BEEN DOING IT? 

2749
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:32,271
IN RETROSPECT, IN HINDSIGHT,

2750
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:35,007
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN RAISING

2751
01:58:35,007 --> 01:58:35,408
BEFORE.

2752
01:58:35,408 --> 01:58:36,275
THE QUESTION IS, WHY DIDN'T THEY

2753
01:58:36,275 --> 01:58:38,044
DO THAT? 

2754
01:58:38,044 --> 01:58:39,745
IT COMES BACK TO WHAT WE WERE

2755
01:58:39,745 --> 01:58:40,946
TALKING ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING

2756
01:58:40,946 --> 01:58:41,847
OF THE HOUR.

2757
01:58:41,847 --> 01:58:42,882
WHILE A NUMBER OF THE INDICATORS

2758
01:58:42,882 --> 01:58:45,084
LOOK PRETTY GOOD AND SEEMED TO

2759
01:58:45,084 --> 01:58:50,523
INDICATE THE PEAK, THE PEAK IS

2760
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:51,190
NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE.

2761
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:54,393
THE IMPLEMENT THE -- THE

2762
01:58:54,393 --> 01:58:55,194
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS BELOW WHERE

2763
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:59,631
IT SHOULD BE.

2764
01:58:59,631 --> 01:59:02,335
THE LABOR MARKET IS 59.6%.

2765
01:59:02,335 --> 01:59:06,238
THAT MEANS THE LABOR PEOPLE ROSE

2766
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:09,475
TO THE WORKING AGE POPULATION IS

2767
01:59:09,475 --> 01:59:10,076
59.6 PERCENT.

2768
01:59:10,076 --> 01:59:13,145
IT SHOULD BE 61.5%, AND THAT IS

2769
01:59:13,145 --> 01:59:15,247
CORRECTING FOR DEMOGRAPHICS.

2770
01:59:15,247 --> 01:59:16,682
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS

2771
01:59:16,682 --> 01:59:17,383
SESSION NUMBER, OF COUPLE

2772
01:59:17,383 --> 01:59:18,351
PERCENTAGE POINTS EVEN ABOVE

2773
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:19,819
THAT.

2774
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:20,653
CORRECTING FOR DEMOGRAPHICS, WE

2775
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:23,422
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER TWO

2776
01:59:23,422 --> 01:59:24,023
PERCENTAGE POINTS.

2777
01:59:24,023 --> 01:59:25,458
THE FED KNOWS THAT.

2778
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:27,626
THEY HAVE KNOWN THAT ALL ALONG.

2779
01:59:27,626 --> 01:59:28,394
IT HAS BEEN THAT NUMBER MORE

2780
01:59:28,394 --> 01:59:29,095
THAN ANY OTHER THAT HAS KEPT

2781
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:31,531
THEM FROM RAISING RATES.

2782
01:59:31,531 --> 01:59:33,566
THEY LOOK FOR THIS THING TO MOVE

2783
01:59:33,566 --> 01:59:34,333
BACK TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE,

2784
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:38,604
AND IT HAS NOT GOTTEN THEIR.

2785
01:59:38,604 --> 01:59:40,940
WE MAY BE RECOVERING, BUT WE ARE

2786
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:41,741
STILL NOT BACK TO WHERE WE NEED

2787
01:59:41,741 --> 01:59:42,575
TO BE.

2788
01:59:42,575 --> 01:59:46,212
IT IS FOR THAT REASON THEY HAVE

2789
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:47,012
BEEN RELUCTANT TO RAISE RATES.

2790
01:59:47,012 --> 01:59:47,780
AS A RESULT, NOW THEY ARE IN A

2791
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:48,648
FIX.

2792
01:59:48,648 --> 01:59:51,417
JON: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

2793
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:53,619
JOINING THIS PROGRAM AND GIVING

2794
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:55,921
US YOUR INSIGHT ON THE JOB

2795
01:59:55,921 --> 01:59:57,990
REPORT AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

2796
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,991
AND CHRISTIAN OF OPPENHEIMER

2797
01:59:58,991 --> 02:00:02,028
FUNDS STILL WITH US.

2798
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:02,862
LOOKING AT THE CONVERSATION OF

2799
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:05,831
THE LAST HOUR, THIS IS HOW IT IS

2800
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:06,532
EXPRESSING ITSELF OVER THE

2801
02:00:06,532 --> 02:00:07,566
TREASURY CURVE.

2802
02:00:07,566 --> 02:00:10,903
IT IS FLAT.

2803
02:00:10,903 --> 02:00:14,073
WE JUST DROP BELOW 250 BASIS

2804
02:00:14,073 --> 02:00:14,507
POINTS.

2805
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:16,142
THE BUYERS, THEY STILL BY THE

2806
02:00:16,142 --> 02:00:17,143
LONG END, AND THE BIAS IS A MUCH

2807
02:00:17,143 --> 02:00:18,844
FODDER YIELD CURVE.

2808
02:00:18,844 --> 02:00:22,181
-- FLATTER YIELD CURVE.

2809
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:22,948
HOW MUCH LONGER DOES THIS PLAY

2810
02:00:22,948 --> 02:00:24,050
OUT? 

2811
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:26,419
CHRISTIAN:

2812
02:00:26,419 --> 02:00:27,286
I THINK THIS WILL BE WITH US FOR

2813
02:00:27,286 --> 02:00:28,087
A LONG TIME.

2814
02:00:28,087 --> 02:00:33,025
THE DRIVER OF THE STORY IS

2815
02:00:33,025 --> 02:00:36,328
EFFECTIVELY THE FIFTH ASSET

2816
02:00:36,328 --> 02:00:37,062
SHORTAGE WE HAD ON A GLOBAL

2817
02:00:37,062 --> 02:00:39,031
BASIS.

2818
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:41,667
IT IS NOT JUST COMING FROM U.S. 

2819
02:00:41,667 --> 02:00:42,868
IT IS COMING FROM JAPAN, MOST OF

2820
02:00:42,868 --> 02:00:45,504
ALL, U.K. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

2821
02:00:45,504 --> 02:00:45,905
WORLD.

2822
02:00:45,905 --> 02:00:46,939
THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME

2823
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:48,274
SOON.

2824
02:00:48,274 --> 02:00:50,810
THAT DOES NOT SAY NOTHING ABOUT

2825
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:53,078
THE JOBS NUMBER IN THE EU ON ANY

2826
02:00:53,078 --> 02:00:53,579
PARTICULAR DAY.

2827
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:56,249
JON: HOW FLAT CAN IT GET? 

2828
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:58,150
CHRISTIAN: IT CAN GET STILL A

2829
02:00:58,150 --> 02:01:03,689
LOT FLATTER.

2830
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:04,457
HISTORICALLY, THE CURVE IS

2831
02:01:04,457 --> 02:01:05,891
REASONABLY STEEP.

2832
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:10,296
IT IS A FLAT, OR IT SEEMS FLAT

2833
02:01:10,296 --> 02:01:13,799
BECAUSE [INDISCERNIBLE]

2834
02:01:13,799 --> 02:01:14,600
BUT I THINK IT CAN GET A LOT

2835
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:15,334
FLATTER.

2836
02:01:15,334 --> 02:01:18,504
JON: CHRISTIAN, GREAT TO HAVE

2837
02:01:18,504 --> 02:01:21,841
YOU WITH US.

2838
02:01:21,841 --> 02:01:22,708
DAVID, WITH SOME BREAKING NEWS.

2839
02:01:22,708 --> 02:01:26,445
DAVID: TO KEEP YOU UPDATED ON

2840
02:01:26,445 --> 02:01:27,713
THE STORY OUT OF THE CAPITAL

2841
02:01:27,713 --> 02:01:28,614
BUILDING, WE HAVE REPORT FROM A

2842
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:31,183
REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS,

2843
02:01:31,183 --> 02:01:33,686
DENNIS ROSS, WHO IS SAYING WHAT

2844
02:01:33,686 --> 02:01:35,221
HAPPENED WAS A STAFF MEMBER FROM

2845
02:01:35,221 --> 02:01:36,555
THE HILL TRY TO ENTER THE

2846
02:01:36,555 --> 02:01:38,557
PREMISES WITH A GUN AND WAS

2847
02:01:38,557 --> 02:01:42,361
APPREHENDED PRESUMABLY.

2848
02:01:42,361 --> 02:01:43,095
THEY HAVE IT ON LOCKDOWN.

2849
02:01:43,095 --> 02:01:45,297
THEY WERE SCHEDULED FOR A HOUSE

2850
02:01:45,297 --> 02:01:46,899
VOTE AT 9:15 EASTERN, 10 MINUTES

2851
02:01:46,899 --> 02:01:49,935
AGO, WHICH HAS BEEN POSTPONED.

2852
02:01:49,935 --> 02:01:50,769
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU

2853
02:01:50,769 --> 02:01:54,240
UP-TO-DATE FROM NEW DEVELOPMENTS

2854
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:55,341
FROM THE CAPITAL AS THEY COOKER.

2855
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:58,644
JOINING US NOW IS JONAS PRIZING

2856
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:04,183
OF MANUS.

2857
02:02:04,183 --> 02:02:04,984
HE PROVIDES CONSULTING AROUND

2858
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:05,451
THE GLOBE.

2859
02:02:05,451 --> 02:02:09,255
WE HAVE NUMBERS COMING OUT.

2860
02:02:09,255 --> 02:02:10,122
YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL SURVEY FROM

2861
02:02:10,122 --> 02:02:10,756
EMPLOYERS.

2862
02:02:10,756 --> 02:02:14,727
IF YOU MAKE OF THESE NUMBERS? 

2863
02:02:14,727 --> 02:02:16,929
JONAS: WE THINK THE ARE

2864
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:17,830
CONSISTENT WITH A SLOW GROWTH

2865
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:19,765
ECONOMY, A GOOD LABOR MARKET

2866
02:02:19,765 --> 02:02:23,769
THAT STILL HAS SOME SLACK.

2867
02:02:23,769 --> 02:02:26,805
YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNCING AROUND

2868
02:02:26,805 --> 02:02:27,573
BETWEEN MAY AND JUNE.

2869
02:02:27,573 --> 02:02:29,108
WE LOOK AT THE THREE-MONTH

2870
02:02:29,108 --> 02:02:31,110
AVERAGE, A SOLID NUMBER, ALMOST

2871
02:02:31,110 --> 02:02:34,780
150,000.

2872
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:35,548
THERE IS WAGE INFLATION, WE

2873
02:02:35,548 --> 02:02:36,382
EXPECT MORE WAGE INFLATION GOING

2874
02:02:36,382 --> 02:02:36,949
FORWARD.

2875
02:02:36,949 --> 02:02:39,451
ALL OF THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A

2876
02:02:39,451 --> 02:02:40,052
GOOD LABOR MARKET.

2877
02:02:40,052 --> 02:02:42,621
THERE IS STILL IS ROOM TO GO

2878
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:43,455
BECAUSE OF THE WORK FORCE RATE

2879
02:02:43,455 --> 02:02:44,089
AT A HISTORICAL LOW.

2880
02:02:44,089 --> 02:02:47,159
DAVID: TICKY BEHIND THE SCENES

2881
02:02:47,159 --> 02:02:51,030
OF THIS SURVEY YOU DID.

2882
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:53,198
11,000 EMPLOYERS, TELL US WHAT

2883
02:02:53,198 --> 02:02:54,166
YOU FOUND WHEN YOU TALKED TO

2884
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:55,134
EMPLOYERS.

2885
02:02:55,134 --> 02:03:00,472
JONAS: WHEN WE SURVEYED 11,000

2886
02:03:00,472 --> 02:03:01,240
EMPLOYERS, WE ASKED A SIMPLE

2887
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,274
QUESTION.

2888
02:03:02,274 --> 02:03:06,111
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE NEXT

2889
02:03:06,111 --> 02:03:08,347
QUARTER, WHAT ARE YOUR HIRING

2890
02:03:08,347 --> 02:03:10,349
FUNCTIONS? A LIGHT YOU GOING TO

2891
02:03:10,349 --> 02:03:11,317
INCREASE OR DECREASE OR HOLD IT

2892
02:03:11,317 --> 02:03:11,784
STABLE? 

2893
02:03:11,784 --> 02:03:13,285
SO WITH RESPONSE THE THIRD

2894
02:03:13,285 --> 02:03:16,255
QUARTER, EMPLOYERS ARE STILL

2895
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:17,756
OPTIMISTIC.

2896
02:03:17,756 --> 02:03:22,061
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR AFTER YEAR

2897
02:03:22,061 --> 02:03:23,596
OUTLOOK, IT IS SLIGHTLY SOFTER,

2898
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:26,966
BUT OVERALL AT A GOOD LEVEL.

2899
02:03:26,966 --> 02:03:27,733
EMPLOYERS LOOK AHEAD TO THE

2900
02:03:27,733 --> 02:03:28,601
FOURTH QUARTER, THEY ARE LOOKING

2901
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:32,304
AT A STABLE SITUATION AS FAR AS

2902
02:03:32,304 --> 02:03:34,406
THEIR BUSINESS OUTLOOK IS

2903
02:03:34,406 --> 02:03:35,140
CONCERNED AND THEY WILL BUY

2904
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:41,947
LARGE AND HIGHER.

2905
02:03:41,947 --> 02:03:42,681
DAVID: TAKE US BELOW THE

2906
02:03:42,681 --> 02:03:43,649
NUMBERS.

2907
02:03:43,649 --> 02:03:47,753
BREAK THEM OUT.

2908
02:03:47,753 --> 02:03:48,687
DO YOU SEE VARIATIONS REGION TO

2909
02:03:48,687 --> 02:03:49,455
REGION? 

2910
02:03:49,455 --> 02:03:52,858
JONAS: WE SEE THIS IS NOTABLE.

2911
02:03:52,858 --> 02:03:55,094
WE SEE STRENGTH ON THE EAST

2912
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:55,494
COAST.

2913
02:03:55,494 --> 02:03:56,629
THEN IT MOVES OVER TO THE WEST

2914
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:59,698
COAST.

2915
02:03:59,698 --> 02:04:00,532
IT HEADED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE

2916
02:04:00,532 --> 02:04:00,966
COUNTRY.

2917
02:04:00,966 --> 02:04:02,968
THIS TIME IT IS WELL JUST SHOULD

2918
02:04:02,968 --> 02:04:05,304
BE DID.

2919
02:04:05,304 --> 02:04:06,171
YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

2920
02:04:06,171 --> 02:04:06,739
VARIOUS SECTORS.

2921
02:04:06,739 --> 02:04:10,209
THE ENERGY OUTLOOK IS DIFFERENT,

2922
02:04:10,209 --> 02:04:11,043
MINING, ANYTHING RELATED TO THE

2923
02:04:11,043 --> 02:04:13,879
CONSUMER IS MUCH STRONGER.

2924
02:04:13,879 --> 02:04:16,482
AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE AND

2925
02:04:16,482 --> 02:04:19,618
RETAIL, THOSE ARE SECTORS WHERE

2926
02:04:19,618 --> 02:04:20,319
THE EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK IS

2927
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:20,886
STRONGER.

2928
02:04:20,886 --> 02:04:25,291
DAVID: YOU DO THIS REGULARLY.

2929
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,058
YOU HAVE NOT REALLY SEEN AN

2930
02:04:26,058 --> 02:04:27,826
UPWARD TREND IN THIS.

2931
02:04:27,826 --> 02:04:32,531
IS THAT CORRECT? 

2932
02:04:32,531 --> 02:04:33,365
THIS IS REASONABLY STABLE OVER

2933
02:04:33,365 --> 02:04:33,732
TIME? 

2934
02:04:33,732 --> 02:04:34,967
THIS WILL IMPROVE GOING OUT? 

2935
02:04:34,967 --> 02:04:38,003
JONAS: IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE

2936
02:04:38,003 --> 02:04:39,905
DONE FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS,

2937
02:04:39,905 --> 02:04:41,540
SURVEYED EMPLOYERS IN THIS WAY

2938
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,275
IN THE U.S. 

2939
02:04:43,275 --> 02:04:44,076
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, OUTLOOK FOR

2940
02:04:44,076 --> 02:04:47,012
THE THIRD QUARTER IS STABLE, SO

2941
02:04:47,012 --> 02:04:49,581
THERE IS NOT AN ANTICIPATED

2942
02:04:49,581 --> 02:04:54,487
INCREASE, BUT ALSO NOT DECREASE.

2943
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:55,320
IT IS CONSISTENT WHAT YOU WOULD

2944
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,022
EXPECT IN A SLOW GROWTH ECONOMY

2945
02:04:57,022 --> 02:04:58,224
WHERE A NUMBER OF PARTS OF THE

2946
02:04:58,224 --> 02:05:00,793
ECONOMY ARE STILL DOING WELL,

2947
02:05:00,793 --> 02:05:04,697
AND THE CONSUMER IS DRIVING GOOD

2948
02:05:04,697 --> 02:05:05,564
ECONOMIC GROWTH AS WELL AS LABOR

2949
02:05:05,564 --> 02:05:07,032
MARKET STABILITY AND

2950
02:05:07,032 --> 02:05:07,499
IMPROVEMENT.

2951
02:05:07,499 --> 02:05:10,102
DAVID: YOU ALSO DO A SURVEY

2952
02:05:10,102 --> 02:05:13,672
SIMILAR TO THIS WORLDWIDE.

2953
02:05:13,672 --> 02:05:14,506
COMPARED THE UNITED STATES WITH

2954
02:05:14,506 --> 02:05:15,307
WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND OVERSEAS.

2955
02:05:15,307 --> 02:05:18,277
JONAS: WE SURVEYED 60,000

2956
02:05:18,277 --> 02:05:20,479
EMPLOYERS WORLDWIDE IN OVER 50

2957
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:22,648
COUNTRIES.

2958
02:05:22,648 --> 02:05:24,617
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A CHALKY

2959
02:05:24,617 --> 02:05:25,150
ENVIRONMENT.

2960
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:29,722
IF YOU LOOK AT EUROPE, THE

2961
02:05:29,722 --> 02:05:30,522
OUTCOME ON THE WHOLE IS SLIGHTLY

2962
02:05:30,522 --> 02:05:31,457
SOFTER.

2963
02:05:31,457 --> 02:05:33,659
AND THEN YOU HAVE REGIONAL

2964
02:05:33,659 --> 02:05:34,159
DIFFERENCES.

2965
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:36,896
GERMANY IS STRONG, IRELAND IS

2966
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:37,696
STRONG, SPAIN AND GREECE ARE

2967
02:05:37,696 --> 02:05:39,999
WEEK.

2968
02:05:39,999 --> 02:05:40,766
U.K. STABLE, BUT AT A LOWER

2969
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:41,734
RATE.

2970
02:05:41,734 --> 02:05:43,602
IT IS A MIXED PICTURE.

2971
02:05:43,602 --> 02:05:48,474
INDIA IS VERY STRONG, JAPAN IS

2972
02:05:48,474 --> 02:05:49,174
HOLDING STEADY WITH CHINA

2973
02:05:49,174 --> 02:05:50,509
SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

2974
02:05:50,509 --> 02:05:52,878
IT IS A MIXED PICTURE.

2975
02:05:52,878 --> 02:05:53,545
OVERALL, I WOULD SAY THE

2976
02:05:53,545 --> 02:05:55,414
EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK IN THE THIRD

2977
02:05:55,414 --> 02:05:56,782
QUARTER IS STABLE TO FINALLY

2978
02:05:56,782 --> 02:05:57,182
SOFTER.

2979
02:05:57,182 --> 02:06:02,554
DAVID: THAT IS JONAS BREEZING,

2980
02:06:02,554 --> 02:06:03,756
CEO OF MANUS GROUP.

2981
02:06:03,756 --> 02:06:07,860
JON: THANK YOU.

2982
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:12,865
287 K IS THE JOB NUMBER.

2983
02:06:12,865 --> 02:06:15,901
THIS IS THE SCENE AS WE APPROACH

2984
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:17,870
THE CASH OPEN IN NEW YORK CITY.

2985
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:18,737
LET'S GO TO THE BOARD.

2986
02:06:18,737 --> 02:06:20,506
FUTURES REMAIN FIRM, S&P 500

2987
02:06:20,506 --> 02:06:23,175
TEACHERS UP.

2988
02:06:23,175 --> 02:06:27,179
20 SECONDS AWAY FROM THE OPEN.

2989
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:31,483
THE FTSE UP 0.5%.

2990
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:32,351
THE EUROPEAN EQUITIES HAD A WEEK

2991
02:06:32,351 --> 02:06:33,319
OF LOSSES.

2992
02:06:33,319 --> 02:06:34,186
YOU HEAR THE BELL, SO SWITCH UP

2993
02:06:34,186 --> 02:06:35,721
THE BOARD.

2994
02:06:35,721 --> 02:06:39,124
QUICKLY.

2995
02:06:39,124 --> 02:06:45,097
DOLLAR-YEN 1 -- 100 POINT 49.

2996
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:46,131
WE CAME BACK AGAIN, THE CABLE

2997
02:06:46,131 --> 02:06:48,434
RATE PUSHING UP TO 129.74,

2998
02:06:48,434 --> 02:06:50,202
APPROACHING 130.

2999
02:06:50,202 --> 02:06:55,174
DOLLAR-YEN 100.46.

3000
02:06:55,174 --> 02:06:58,644
THERE WAS FOUR OR FIVE BASIS

3001
02:06:58,644 --> 02:06:59,444
POINTS AROUND THE CURVE, NOW WE

3002
02:06:59,444 --> 02:07:01,347
ARE UNCHANGED AT 4.9%.

3003
02:07:01,347 --> 02:07:04,516
WTI, THE BIGGEST WEEK OF LOSSES

3004
02:07:04,516 --> 02:07:07,653
SINCE FEBRUARY.

3005
02:07:07,653 --> 02:07:11,557
ALMOST SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS.

3006
02:07:11,557 --> 02:07:13,425
SECTION ACROSS IT SINCE BECOME A

3007
02:07:13,425 --> 02:07:14,760
LESLEY AT THE MARKET AND GET THE

3008
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:15,227
MOVERS HE.

3009
02:07:15,227 --> 02:07:15,928
HERE IS RAMY INOCENCIO.

3010
02:07:15,928 --> 02:07:19,498
RAMY: INITIAL REACTION AFTER

3011
02:07:19,498 --> 02:07:21,600
STELLAR JOB NUMBERS CAME OUT AT

3012
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,067
8:30 A.M. 

3013
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:28,040
THE DOW IS UP 0.8%, S&P UP 0.7%.

3014
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:32,645
THE NASDAQ, UP AS WELL.

3015
02:07:32,645 --> 02:07:36,181
BLOWING UP THE HIGHEST ESTIMATES

3016
02:07:36,181 --> 02:07:40,819
, 287,000.

3017
02:07:40,819 --> 02:07:41,453
INTERESTING STUFF.

3018
02:07:41,453 --> 02:07:43,622
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WAS

3019
02:07:43,622 --> 02:07:44,389
HAPPENING WITH S&P 500 FUTURES

3020
02:07:44,389 --> 02:07:44,790
AS WELL.

3021
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:47,593
YOU CAN SEE 8:30 A.M., WHEN WE

3022
02:07:47,593 --> 02:07:49,127
GET THIS LEG UP, NUMBERS CAME

3023
02:07:49,127 --> 02:07:51,363
UP. WE SAW NUMBERS WITH THE ESA

3024
02:07:51,363 --> 02:07:53,065
AS WELL.

3025
02:07:53,065 --> 02:07:53,966
LET'S SEE WHERE WE ARE IN TERM

3026
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:57,703
OF THE S&P 500 BASED ON THE POST

3027
02:07:57,703 --> 02:08:02,274
BREXIT VOTE BACK ON JUNE 24.

3028
02:08:02,274 --> 02:08:06,578
COMING BACK FROM JUNE 23, ALL

3029
02:08:06,578 --> 02:08:07,746
THE WAY UNTIL TODAY, LESS THAN

3030
02:08:07,746 --> 02:08:10,916
0.1%, THE 2113 NUMBERS WHILE

3031
02:08:10,916 --> 02:08:12,651
RECOUPING ALL OF THE LOSSES EVER

3032
02:08:12,651 --> 02:08:15,154
SINCE THEN.

3033
02:08:15,154 --> 02:08:15,988
LET'S LOOK AT SAFE HAVENS,

3034
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:18,624
PARTICULARLY GOLD.

3035
02:08:18,624 --> 02:08:19,458
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, WE DO SEE A

3036
02:08:19,458 --> 02:08:25,030
LEG DOWN JUST AT 8:30, BUT THAT

3037
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:27,299
WAS A SHORT-LIVED LITTLE EVENT.

3038
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:28,934
GOLD IS NO CLIMBING JUST A HAIR

3039
02:08:28,934 --> 02:08:32,671
ABOVE ON THE POSITIVE LINE,

3040
02:08:32,671 --> 02:08:34,973
$1371 IS WHERE WE POP UP.

3041
02:08:34,973 --> 02:08:40,245
NOW $3063.

3042
02:08:40,245 --> 02:08:41,080
-- $1363.

3043
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:46,585
ALIX: WE HAVE THE BLACKROCK CIO

3044
02:08:46,585 --> 02:08:48,187
OF FIXED INCOME JOINS US.

3045
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:50,322
HE MANAGES TO $.3 TRILLION IN

3046
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:52,658
FIXED INCOME ASSETS.

3047
02:08:52,658 --> 02:08:53,425
USE SELLING SHORT END OF THE

3048
02:08:53,425 --> 02:08:54,826
BUYING THE LONG END OF THE

3049
02:08:54,826 --> 02:08:55,260
CURVE? 

3050
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:58,563
>> I THINK THAT IS LONGER THAN

3051
02:08:58,563 --> 02:08:59,197
THE TRADE OF THE DAY.

3052
02:08:59,197 --> 02:09:01,199
I THINK THAT CURVE WILL KEEP

3053
02:09:01,199 --> 02:09:01,667
FLATTENING.

3054
02:09:01,667 --> 02:09:04,836
THAT DYNAMIC WHEN THE DEMAND FOR

3055
02:09:04,836 --> 02:09:07,806
THE LONG INTEREST RATES AND

3056
02:09:07,806 --> 02:09:10,309
GROWTH WHERE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH

3057
02:09:10,309 --> 02:09:10,976
YIELD IS A STURDY VERY.

3058
02:09:10,976 --> 02:09:11,877
THAT KEEPS PRESSURE IN THE BACK

3059
02:09:11,877 --> 02:09:15,047
AND THE FRONT IS TOO HIGH.

3060
02:09:15,047 --> 02:09:16,114
WE WERE PRICING IN A CUT.

3061
02:09:16,114 --> 02:09:18,383
MARKETS ARE PRICING IN A CUT IF

3062
02:09:18,383 --> 02:09:20,152
YOU GO BACK A FEW DAYS, THAT IS

3063
02:09:20,152 --> 02:09:21,787
CRAZY.

3064
02:09:21,787 --> 02:09:22,587
THE FED IS NOT IN ANY MOOD TO

3065
02:09:22,587 --> 02:09:24,623
CUT RATES.

3066
02:09:24,623 --> 02:09:25,390
THEY HAVE MORE ROOM TO GO.

3067
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:28,327
WE SEE FLATTENING.

3068
02:09:28,327 --> 02:09:32,431
JON: LET'S GET A RED HEADLINE,

3069
02:09:32,431 --> 02:09:37,903
DOUBT REACHED 4.8%.

3070
02:09:37,903 --> 02:09:38,670
LOOKING AT THE CURVE, FLAT,

3071
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:39,705
FLAT.

3072
02:09:39,705 --> 02:09:40,339
I WONDER HOW FLAT.

3073
02:09:40,339 --> 02:09:44,443
WE ARE AROUND 200 BASIS POINTS,

3074
02:09:44,443 --> 02:09:46,678
HOW FLAT REALLY GO? 

3075
02:09:46,678 --> 02:09:48,480
-- WILL IT GO? 

3076
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:53,385
RICK: IF YOU GO BACK IN HISTORY,

3077
02:09:53,385 --> 02:09:55,387
WE ARE AT A REASONABLY STEEP

3078
02:09:55,387 --> 02:09:56,588
YIELD CURVE FOR AN ECONOMY

3079
02:09:56,588 --> 02:09:58,857
OPERATING AT A DECENT LEVEL.

3080
02:09:58,857 --> 02:09:59,691
CAN WE GET ANOTHER 20, 25 BASIS

3081
02:09:59,691 --> 02:10:03,695
POINTS TO FLATTEN? 

3082
02:10:03,695 --> 02:10:06,598
IT IS INCREDIBLE.

3083
02:10:06,598 --> 02:10:09,501
ONE END OF THE CURVE IS NOT

3084
02:10:09,501 --> 02:10:11,470
CHEAP, BUT ORGANICALLY CHEAP FOR

3085
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:12,771
THE INFLATION RATES.

3086
02:10:12,771 --> 02:10:13,638
THE FRONT END IS TOO HIGH, THERE

3087
02:10:13,638 --> 02:10:15,774
COULD BE BACK UP IN THE OTHER

3088
02:10:15,774 --> 02:10:16,541
END, GET 20, 25 OUT OF IT.

3089
02:10:16,541 --> 02:10:20,846
JON: TALK TO ME ABOUT DURATION

3090
02:10:20,846 --> 02:10:21,680
RISK AND HOW THINGS ARE GETTING

3091
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:24,516
A LITTLE BIT OVERDONE IN SOME

3092
02:10:24,516 --> 02:10:25,551
WAYS? 

3093
02:10:25,551 --> 02:10:30,055
RICK: IF YOU TAKE AWAY WHAT IS

3094
02:10:30,055 --> 02:10:30,889
FAIR VALUE OF THE 10 YEAR, IT IS

3095
02:10:30,889 --> 02:10:33,658
WELL BACK, 50 TO 75 BACK OF

3096
02:10:33,658 --> 02:10:35,594
WHERE THESE LEVELS ARE.

3097
02:10:35,594 --> 02:10:37,362
BUT WE ARE NOT GETTING BACK TO

3098
02:10:37,362 --> 02:10:38,764
FAIR VALUE ANYTIME SOON.

3099
02:10:38,764 --> 02:10:39,531
THE PRESSURE IN TERMS OF THE

3100
02:10:39,531 --> 02:10:40,032
NEED FOR YIELD.

3101
02:10:40,032 --> 02:10:43,869
THINK ABOUT POST BREXIT.

3102
02:10:43,869 --> 02:10:44,703
YOU TOOK ONE COUNTRY, THE OTHER

3103
02:10:44,703 --> 02:10:47,472
MAJOR ECONOMY THAT WAS IN THE

3104
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:50,742
EU, A TIGHTENING MODE, HAS

3105
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:54,079
SUGGESTED EASING.

3106
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:55,681
SO NOW IT IS EASY TO GET YIELDS,

3107
02:10:55,681 --> 02:10:58,950
SO THE 10 YEAR STAYS IN THIS

3108
02:10:58,950 --> 02:10:59,351
RANGE.

3109
02:10:59,351 --> 02:11:01,420
ANY NEGATIVE NEWS ON THE ECONOMY

3110
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:04,790
OR POLITICAL WILL PUSH DOWN A

3111
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:06,591
BIT.

3112
02:11:06,591 --> 02:11:07,759
THE KEY OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT A

3113
02:11:07,759 --> 02:11:10,662
LOT IS, HOW DO YOU GET INCOME

3114
02:11:10,662 --> 02:11:11,864
OUT OF FIXED INCOME? 

3115
02:11:11,864 --> 02:11:14,132
THE NUMBER WAS GOOD FOR KERRY

3116
02:11:14,132 --> 02:11:15,133
ASSETS, CREDIT MARKETS, EMERGING

3117
02:11:15,133 --> 02:11:15,567
MARKETS.

3118
02:11:15,567 --> 02:11:17,502
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD ARGUE,

3119
02:11:17,502 --> 02:11:19,905
CLOSE TO A GOOD NUMBER FOR

3120
02:11:19,905 --> 02:11:21,907
EMERGING MARKETS.

3121
02:11:21,907 --> 02:11:23,875
EMERGING MARKETS TO NOT REACT

3122
02:11:23,875 --> 02:11:25,844
TERRIBLY TO BREXIT.

3123
02:11:25,844 --> 02:11:28,013
THEY HELD UP ALL RIGHT.

3124
02:11:28,013 --> 02:11:29,781
GIVEN THE FACT THERE WAS NO

3125
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:30,916
YIELD TO BE FOUND IN THE REST OF

3126
02:11:30,916 --> 02:11:31,950
THE WORLD, IT SEEMS LIKE, IS

3127
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:32,751
THAT A POINT TO MAKE NOW FOR THE

3128
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:33,919
EMERGING MARKETS? 

3129
02:11:33,919 --> 02:11:37,256
>> THE HARD THING ABOUT EMERGING

3130
02:11:37,256 --> 02:11:39,057
MARKETS IS A MONIKER.

3131
02:11:39,057 --> 02:11:44,162
USUALLY AVERAGE YIELD, YOU FEEL

3132
02:11:44,162 --> 02:11:44,830
GOOD ABOUT INVESTING.

3133
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:45,530
YOU GET INTO THE INDIVIDUAL

3134
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:47,332
NAMES.

3135
02:11:47,332 --> 02:11:49,067
THERE ARE SOME TOUGH STORIES.

3136
02:11:49,067 --> 02:11:51,002
YOU HAVE AN ECONOMY OPERATING AT

3137
02:11:51,002 --> 02:11:53,372
A DECENT LEVEL, WHICH THE U.S.

3138
02:11:53,372 --> 02:11:54,206
IS, AND WE ARE SEEING GROWTH IN

3139
02:11:54,206 --> 02:11:58,176
THE EMERGING WORLD STABILIZING

3140
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,279
AT LEVELS, THAT IS GOOD.

3141
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:01,513
NOT OVERHEATING GROWTH.

3142
02:12:01,513 --> 02:12:02,347
YOU GO IN AND THINK ABOUT WHICH

3143
02:12:02,347 --> 02:12:06,051
PARTS OF THE EMERGING MARKETS,

3144
02:12:06,051 --> 02:12:06,852
ASIA, INDIA WE HAVE LIKED QUITE

3145
02:12:06,852 --> 02:12:09,521
A BIT.

3146
02:12:09,521 --> 02:12:10,422
WE'VE BEEN ADDING TO BRAZIL A

3147
02:12:10,422 --> 02:12:11,089
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND

3148
02:12:11,089 --> 02:12:14,293
ARGENTINA.

3149
02:12:14,293 --> 02:12:17,863
BUT GENERICALLY, HAS YOU SAID,

3150
02:12:17,863 --> 02:12:19,731
YOU CAN GET YIELD AND REAL

3151
02:12:19,731 --> 02:12:21,433
RATES.

3152
02:12:21,433 --> 02:12:22,234
SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES WILL

3153
02:12:22,234 --> 02:12:23,135
HAVE TO EASE AND WHERE THEY ARE.

3154
02:12:23,135 --> 02:12:26,171
DAVID: MEXICO, WHAT IS GOING ON

3155
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:27,172
WITH MEXICO? 

3156
02:12:27,172 --> 02:12:31,343
RICK: A TRICKY DYNAMIC.

3157
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:32,277
WE TALKED ABOUT A MONTH AGO OR

3158
02:12:32,277 --> 02:12:35,480
SO, IT IS A NAME WE HAVE LIKED.

3159
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,281
THAT BEING SAID, WE REDUCED

3160
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:41,086
EXPOSURE OVER TIME, FOR NO OTHER

3161
02:12:41,086 --> 02:12:41,887
REASON THAN GETTING TO A STABLE

3162
02:12:41,887 --> 02:12:45,190
ECONOMY, GROWTH AND INFLATION

3163
02:12:45,190 --> 02:12:45,690
READY GOOD.

3164
02:12:45,690 --> 02:12:46,491
CERTAINLY SOME CHALLENGES AROUND

3165
02:12:46,491 --> 02:12:48,460
THE CURRENCY, BUT TECHNICALS IN

3166
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:49,394
THE MARKET ARE NOT TERRIFIC.

3167
02:12:49,394 --> 02:12:51,697
IT HAS BEEN A TRICKY ONE.

3168
02:12:51,697 --> 02:12:52,564
THE OUTSET'S ARE REASONABLE.

3169
02:12:52,564 --> 02:12:54,566
THAT IS ONE OF THE CHEAPER

3170
02:12:54,566 --> 02:12:58,870
PLACES TO GO.

3171
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:00,505
THERE MAY BE A LOT OF TIME

3172
02:13:00,505 --> 02:13:01,239
BEFORE RETURN IS POSITIVE IN

3173
02:13:01,239 --> 02:13:02,541
TERMS OF MEXICO GOING FORWARD.

3174
02:13:02,541 --> 02:13:05,043
DAVID: WE WANT TO GO NOW TO

3175
02:13:05,043 --> 02:13:07,579
JASON FROEMMING, THE COUNCIL

3176
02:13:07,579 --> 02:13:10,816
ECONOMIC CHAIRMAN.

3177
02:13:10,816 --> 02:13:12,551
WELCOME DR. FUHRMAN.

3178
02:13:12,551 --> 02:13:15,620
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

3179
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:20,158
DAVID: WE WERE SURPRISED BY

3180
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:20,725
THESE JOBS NUMBER.

3181
02:13:20,725 --> 02:13:21,326
WERE YOU SURPRISED? 

3182
02:13:21,326 --> 02:13:24,663
>> I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE

3183
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:25,130
SURPRISED.

3184
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:25,931
THESE NUMBER IS BOUNCE AROUND A

3185
02:13:25,931 --> 02:13:26,298
LOT.

3186
02:13:26,298 --> 02:13:30,502
WE ARE NOT GOOD AT MEASURING THE

3187
02:13:30,502 --> 02:13:31,636
ECONOMY AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE,

3188
02:13:31,636 --> 02:13:32,671
SO WE SHOULD DO PRETEND WE CAN

3189
02:13:32,671 --> 02:13:37,608
DO THAT REALLY WELL.

3190
02:13:37,608 --> 02:13:38,443
WE ARE ADDING JOBS AT THE PACE

3191
02:13:38,443 --> 02:13:39,110
OF 150,000 JOBS A MONTH.

3192
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:40,745
THAT IS MILD DECLINE IN THE

3193
02:13:40,745 --> 02:13:42,714
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

3194
02:13:42,714 --> 02:13:44,983
IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE GIVEN

3195
02:13:44,983 --> 02:13:46,585
WHERE WE ARE IN THE ECONOMY

3196
02:13:46,585 --> 02:13:47,786
RIGHT NOW.

3197
02:13:47,786 --> 02:13:51,890
DAVID: SOUTH IS THE

3198
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:52,724
PARTICIPATION RATE AND CONCERNS

3199
02:13:52,724 --> 02:13:56,861
ABOUT THAT, PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

3200
02:13:56,861 --> 02:13:58,129
IT IS TWO OR THREE POINTS BELOW

3201
02:13:58,129 --> 02:13:58,763
WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE.

3202
02:13:58,763 --> 02:13:59,331
ARE YOU CONCERNED? 

3203
02:13:59,331 --> 02:14:02,000
JASON: THE LARGEST THING THAT IS

3204
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,036
GOING ON IS THE AGING OF THE

3205
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:05,604
POPULATION.

3206
02:14:05,604 --> 02:14:07,839
ABOVE AND BEYOND THE AGING, I

3207
02:14:07,839 --> 02:14:09,908
THINK WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED

3208
02:14:09,908 --> 02:14:11,810
THAT THE PARTICIPATION RATE HAS

3209
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:13,745
BEEN FALLING FOR 60 YEARS,

3210
02:14:13,745 --> 02:14:16,148
ADJUSTED FOR AGE FOR MEN, AND 15

3211
02:14:16,148 --> 02:14:17,849
YEARS ADJUSTED FOR AGE FOR

3212
02:14:17,849 --> 02:14:20,052
WOMEN.

3213
02:14:20,052 --> 02:14:22,554
THERE IS A LONG-TERM ISSUE IN

3214
02:14:22,554 --> 02:14:23,288
TERMS OF FUNCTIONING OF THE

3215
02:14:23,288 --> 02:14:23,755
LABOR MARKET.

3216
02:14:23,755 --> 02:14:24,422
YOU ARE THAT WE HAVE SEEN

3217
02:14:24,422 --> 02:14:25,290
RECENTLY.

3218
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:29,861
WE PARTICIPATION RATE STABILIZE,

3219
02:14:29,861 --> 02:14:31,329
AND THAT IS BECAUSE DEMOGRAPHY

3220
02:14:31,329 --> 02:14:32,097
IS DRAGGING IN ONE DIRECTION.

3221
02:14:32,097 --> 02:14:36,401
THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY IS

3222
02:14:36,401 --> 02:14:37,202
PULLING PEOPLE BACK, AND THEY

3223
02:14:37,202 --> 02:14:37,736
ARE CANCELING OUT.

3224
02:14:37,736 --> 02:14:40,338
IN THE SHORT RUN, I FEEL GOOD

3225
02:14:40,338 --> 02:14:41,139
ABOUT IT, BUT WE NEED A BIGGER

3226
02:14:41,139 --> 02:14:42,340
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LONG-RUN

3227
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:45,210
TRENDS.

3228
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:50,215
RICK: NASTY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT

3229
02:14:50,215 --> 02:14:53,418
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY -- I

3230
02:14:53,418 --> 02:14:54,219
WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING

3231
02:14:54,219 --> 02:14:55,687
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

3232
02:14:55,687 --> 02:14:56,554
THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN LOW, WHICH

3233
02:14:56,554 --> 02:15:00,692
IS INDICATIVE OF A VERY GOOD

3234
02:15:00,692 --> 02:15:01,226
LABOR MARKET.

3235
02:15:01,226 --> 02:15:04,996
THE DISPERSION BETWEEN MAY AND

3236
02:15:04,996 --> 02:15:06,631
JUNE WAS BIGGER THAN ANYTHING.

3237
02:15:06,631 --> 02:15:07,265
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT? 

3238
02:15:07,265 --> 02:15:10,535
JASON: IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THE

3239
02:15:10,535 --> 02:15:12,471
ECONOMY WAS REALLY TERRIBLE IN

3240
02:15:12,471 --> 02:15:14,439
MAY AND REALLY GREAT IN JIM.

3241
02:15:14,439 --> 02:15:20,078
I THINK EVERY GEOS -- EVERYTHING

3242
02:15:20,078 --> 02:15:20,845
THERE WAS INSISTENT WITH INTO

3243
02:15:20,845 --> 02:15:21,813
GATORS.

3244
02:15:21,813 --> 02:15:26,084
THE -- OTHER INDICATORS.

3245
02:15:26,084 --> 02:15:26,885
THERE IS A RANGE OF ECONOMIC

3246
02:15:26,885 --> 02:15:28,653
DATA.

3247
02:15:28,653 --> 02:15:32,891
THEY ARE HOUSING AROUND AS LESS

3248
02:15:32,891 --> 02:15:35,794
THEY DID IN THE PAST.

3249
02:15:35,794 --> 02:15:38,163
-- BOUNCING AROUND LESS THAN

3250
02:15:38,163 --> 02:15:38,797
THEY DID IN THE PAST.

3251
02:15:38,797 --> 02:15:43,001
ALIX: I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CHART

3252
02:15:43,001 --> 02:15:44,836
ON THE BLOOMBERG.

3253
02:15:44,836 --> 02:15:49,374
IF YOU LOOK AT BLOOMBERG, IT IS

3254
02:15:49,374 --> 02:15:52,144
NON-FIRM PAYROLL NUMBERS,

3255
02:15:52,144 --> 02:15:52,744
287,000 FOR JUNE.

3256
02:15:52,744 --> 02:15:58,083
THERE IS THE UNDERLYING, THE RED

3257
02:15:58,083 --> 02:16:00,085
LINE, 147,000.

3258
02:16:00,085 --> 02:16:04,022
THE FIRST QUARTER WAS 200,000.

3259
02:16:04,022 --> 02:16:05,857
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE PACE,

3260
02:16:05,857 --> 02:16:07,993
THE OVERALL PACE? 

3261
02:16:07,993 --> 02:16:11,963
JASON: WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS THE

3262
02:16:11,963 --> 02:16:15,500
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STAYING LOW

3263
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:17,202
AND PEOPLE GETTING WAGE GAINS.

3264
02:16:17,202 --> 02:16:19,003
4.9% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER THE

3265
02:16:19,003 --> 02:16:22,807
LAST 10 YEAR, WAGES UP 2.6% HIM

3266
02:16:22,807 --> 02:16:24,042
A THAT IS TIED FOR THE FASTEST

3267
02:16:24,042 --> 02:16:24,809
PACE OF NOMINAL WAGE GROWTH IN

3268
02:16:24,809 --> 02:16:27,946
THE RECOVERY.

3269
02:16:27,946 --> 02:16:28,813
WE SIMPLY DON'T NEED TO ADD AS

3270
02:16:28,813 --> 02:16:32,049
MANY JOBS TO GET THE

3271
02:16:32,049 --> 02:16:34,919
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WHERE IT IS OR

3272
02:16:34,919 --> 02:16:37,689
FROM TRENDING DOWN.

3273
02:16:37,689 --> 02:16:38,456
THE REASON WE ARE ADDING IS

3274
02:16:38,456 --> 02:16:39,991
BECAUSE THE IN EMPLOYMENT RATE

3275
02:16:39,991 --> 02:16:42,826
WAS SO HIGH.

3276
02:16:42,826 --> 02:16:43,695
IT WAS A SYSTEM OF HOW MUCH WORK

3277
02:16:43,695 --> 02:16:45,362
WE NEEDED TO DO.

3278
02:16:45,362 --> 02:16:48,433
WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO, BUT

3279
02:16:48,433 --> 02:16:48,933
NOT AS MUCH.

3280
02:16:48,933 --> 02:16:51,269
IT IS QUITE NATURAL, EXPECTED,

3281
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:52,370
AND I FEEL GOOD.

3282
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:55,773
DAVID: THIS IS A DIFFERENT

3283
02:16:55,773 --> 02:16:56,474
SUBJECT, BUT ON ALL OF OUR

3284
02:16:56,474 --> 02:16:57,808
MINDS.

3285
02:16:57,808 --> 02:16:58,643
THAT IS THE TRAGIC SHOOTING OF

3286
02:16:58,643 --> 02:17:00,577
THE POLICE OFFICERS IN DALLAS

3287
02:17:00,577 --> 02:17:01,012

3291
02:17:06,584 --> 02:17:09,921
JASON: THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS

3292
02:17:09,921 --> 02:17:11,623
A VICIOUS CALCULATED AND

3293
02:17:11,623 --> 02:17:14,359
DESPICABLE ATTACK.

HE IS OVERSEAS, AND THAT

3296
02:17:20,898 --> 02:17:21,665

MARKETS.

3318
02:20:25,416 --> 02:20:28,119
WE HAVE SEEN THE DOUBT GOING

3319
02:20:28,119 --> 02:20:29,153
DOWN, BUT THERE WAS SOME THINGS

3320
02:20:29,153 --> 02:20:30,388
IN THE REPORT THAT MIGHT MAKE US

3321
02:20:30,388 --> 02:20:33,191
MORE NERVOUS.

3322
02:20:33,191 --> 02:20:37,028
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TICKED UP.

3323
02:20:37,028 --> 02:20:37,895
THERE WAS NOT MUCH WAGE GROWTH.

3324
02:20:37,895 --> 02:20:43,133
HE WILL ADDRESS THESE.

3325
02:20:43,133 --> 02:20:44,469

STORY OF THE CAPITAL LOCKED

3330
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:56,681
DOWN.

3331
02:20:56,681 --> 02:21:01,285
THE LOCKDOWN ORDER HAS BEEN

3332
02:21:01,285 --> 02:21:04,022
LIFTED.

3333
02:21:04,022 --> 02:21:04,889
A CAPITOL HILL STAFFER TRIED TO

3334
02:21:04,889 --> 02:21:08,426
GET TO WORK, AND THEN THERE WAS

3335
02:21:08,426 --> 02:21:11,062
A LOT DOWN BECAUSE HE BROUGHT A

3336
02:21:11,062 --> 02:21:11,830
GUN.

3337
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:16,334
LET'S GET A LOOK AT THE MOVERS

3338
02:21:16,334 --> 02:21:22,840
WITH RAMY INOCENCIO.

3339
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:23,675
RAMY: I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT

02:21:23,675 --> 02:21:24,308

02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:26,711
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF

MARKETS TODAY.

3345
02:21:29,347 --> 02:21:30,148
I WANT TO GET TO SOME MOVERS

3346
02:21:30,148 --> 02:21:33,084
RIGHT NOW, AND FIRST ANALYST

3347
02:21:33,084 --> 02:21:35,253
ACTION IN TERMS OF

02:21:35,253 --> 02:21:35,987
MICROPROCESSING AS WELL AS

3349
02:21:35,987 --> 02:21:37,155
COMPUTERS.

3350
02:21:37,155 --> 02:21:41,025
ADVANCED DEVICES DOWN ONE POINT

3351
02:21:41,025 --> 02:21:42,126
FOR PERCENT BECAUSE BERNSTEIN

3352
02:21:42,126 --> 02:21:42,927
HAS DECIDED TO CUT ITS READING

3353
02:21:42,927 --> 02:21:46,831
ON THE COMPANY TO UNDERPERFORM

3354
02:21:46,831 --> 02:21:48,566
FROM MARKET PERFORM, SAYING THE

3355
02:21:48,566 --> 02:21:49,233
GROWTH MAY NOT MEET

3356
02:21:49,233 --> 02:21:49,767
EXPECTATIONS.

3357
02:21:49,767 --> 02:21:51,235
AS FOR BERNSTEIN, AS FOR INTEL,

3358
02:21:51,235 --> 02:21:54,038
IT IS GOING UP 1.8%.

3359
02:21:54,038 --> 02:21:55,173
THAT IS BECAUSE BERNSTEIN IS

3360
02:21:55,173 --> 02:22:00,478
RAISING ITS INTEL FROM

3361
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:01,279
UNDERPERFORM TO OVER PERFORM.

3362
02:22:01,279 --> 02:22:05,283
IT WILL NOT COMMIT SECOND ORDER

3363
02:22:05,283 --> 02:22:06,084
EARNINGS BECAUSE OF RECOVERY IN

3364
02:22:06,084 --> 02:22:08,186
THE PC EARNINGS MARKET.

3365
02:22:08,186 --> 02:22:11,689
LET'S GO TO THE CLOSING SPACE --

3366
02:22:11,689 --> 02:22:12,256
CLOTHING SPACE.

3367
02:22:12,256 --> 02:22:12,690
GAP IS UP.

3368
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:14,926
THIS IS THE HIGHEST IN THE PAST

3369
02:22:14,926 --> 02:22:15,426
TWO MONTHS.

3370
02:22:15,426 --> 02:22:17,061
THIS IS UP SURPRISE JUMP IN

3371
02:22:17,061 --> 02:22:19,197
COMPS SALES, VERSUS THE ESTIMATE

3372
02:22:19,197 --> 02:22:24,802

LOCALS, OLD NAVY, THEY ALL BE

3374
02:22:26,270 --> 02:22:26,738
THEIR BEST.

3375
02:22:26,738 --> 02:22:30,441
OLD NAVY UP 5%, YEAR ON YEAR

3376
02:22:30,441 --> 02:22:32,477

3377
02:22:32,477 --> 02:22:35,413
THANK YOU.

02:22:42,954 --> 02:22:43,788
SESSION, LOOKING AT THE NASDAQ,

3381
02:22:43,788 --> 02:22:44,422
ABIGAIL DOOLITTLE.

3382
02:22:44,422 --> 02:22:49,894
REPORTER: FITTING TO THAT, LET'S

3383
02:22:49,894 --> 02:22:50,728
START UP WITH THE BIG WINNERS AT

3384
02:22:50,728 --> 02:22:51,162
THE NASDAQ.

3385
02:22:51,162 --> 02:22:53,731
POLY CO. SHARES ARE UP 13%.

3386
02:22:53,731 --> 02:22:54,499
THE COMPANY IS GOING TO BE

3387
02:22:54,499 --> 02:22:59,470
ACQUIRED BY SEROUS CAPITAL.

3388
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:06,110
A 12 OR 15% PREMIUM TO

3389
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:07,011
YESTERDAY'S CLOSE, AND POLYCOM

3390
02:23:07,011 --> 02:23:08,580
IS ABOUT THAT.

3391
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:15,687
THIS DID IMPACT WITH MIKE STILL.

3392
02:23:15,687 --> 02:23:18,589
THERE IS SHAREHOLDER RELIEF THAT

3393
02:23:18,589 --> 02:23:19,190
DID NOT GET THROUGH.

3394
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:22,326
AND TRADING SHARPLY HIGHER,

3395
02:23:22,326 --> 02:23:24,662
BARRACUDA NETWORKS.

3396
02:23:24,662 --> 02:23:27,565
THEY BEAT FIRST ORDER ESTIMATES

3397
02:23:27,565 --> 02:23:30,168
EARNINGS BY 15%, 82%.

3398
02:23:30,168 --> 02:23:31,002
THEY ALSO RAISE THE FULL-YEAR

3399
02:23:31,002 --> 02:23:31,736
OUTLOOK.

3400
02:23:31,736 --> 02:23:33,871
SECURITY STOCKS DID NOT RISE AS

3401
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:38,176
WELL.

3402
02:23:38,176 --> 02:23:38,976
AND ANOTHER THING, WD-40, THE

3403
02:23:38,976 --> 02:23:42,980
SPRAY COMPANY IS DOWN AFTER THEY

3404
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:43,714
MISSED FISCAL THIRD-QUARTER

3405
02:23:43,714 --> 02:23:45,883
ESTIMATES.

3406
02:23:45,883 --> 02:23:47,552
SHARES ARE SHARPLY HIGHER, SO

3407
02:23:47,552 --> 02:23:50,788
THIS COULD IMPACT THE STOCK

3408
02:23:50,788 --> 02:23:51,889
PICKERS DID LIGHT.

3409
02:23:51,889 --> 02:23:55,026
ALIX: RICK READER STILL WITH US

3410
02:23:55,026 --> 02:23:57,962
FROM BLACKROCK, CIO OF GLOBAL

3411
02:23:57,962 --> 02:23:59,063
FIXED INCOME.

3412
02:23:59,063 --> 02:24:02,967
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

3413
02:24:02,967 --> 02:24:05,169
FLATTENING OF THE YIELD CURVE,

3414
02:24:05,169 --> 02:24:05,937
LEADING INVESTORS INTO PLACES

3415
02:24:05,937 --> 02:24:08,072
LIKE HIGH-YIELD.

3416
02:24:08,072 --> 02:24:11,209
BANK OF AMERICA, BULLISH ON

3417
02:24:11,209 --> 02:24:11,876
TECHNICALS, BEARISH ON

3418
02:24:11,876 --> 02:24:12,410
FUNDAMENTALS.

3419
02:24:12,410 --> 02:24:13,177
THEY SAY THEY WILL HAVE TO CLOSE

3420
02:24:13,177 --> 02:24:13,444
.

3421
02:24:13,444 --> 02:24:15,079
WHAT DO YOU MAKE? 

3422
02:24:15,079 --> 02:24:20,484
RICK: I AGREE WITH THE BULLISH

3423
02:24:20,484 --> 02:24:21,018
ON TECHNICALS.

3424
02:24:21,018 --> 02:24:22,420
THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE MIXED.

3425
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,221
BULLISH ON TECHNICALS, THE

3426
02:24:23,221 --> 02:24:27,225
VALUATIONS HAVE GOTTEN FULL IN

3427
02:24:27,225 --> 02:24:27,992
SOME PARTS OF THE HIGH-YIELD

3428
02:24:27,992 --> 02:24:28,392
MARKET.

3429
02:24:28,392 --> 02:24:30,027
RICH IN SOME PARTS OF IT.

3430
02:24:30,027 --> 02:24:31,062
IT WOULD STILL DO ITS JOB.

3431
02:24:31,062 --> 02:24:34,465
IT WILL CREATE THE CARRY IN YOUR

3432
02:24:34,465 --> 02:24:35,166
PORTFOLIO THAT YOU WANT TO

3433
02:24:35,166 --> 02:24:36,601
CREATE.

3434
02:24:36,601 --> 02:24:37,401
I DISAGREE ON THE FUNDAMENTALS

3435
02:24:37,401 --> 02:24:40,137
SIDE, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LEVERAGE

3436
02:24:40,137 --> 02:24:40,671
THAT GOES ON.

3437
02:24:40,671 --> 02:24:44,108
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS TERMS COME

3438
02:24:44,108 --> 02:24:44,475
OUT.

3439
02:24:44,475 --> 02:24:47,278
THE THING THAT DEALS COMPANIES

3440
02:24:47,278 --> 02:24:50,014
IN HIGH-YIELD IS IF LIQUIDITY IS

3441
02:24:50,014 --> 02:24:50,982
A PROBLEM.

3442
02:24:50,982 --> 02:24:51,849
IF YOU TERM YOUR DEBT OUT, YOU

3443
02:24:51,849 --> 02:24:52,717
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN FRONT OF

3444
02:24:52,717 --> 02:24:56,454
YOU THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS.

3445
02:24:56,454 --> 02:24:57,255
OR YOUR DEBT SERVICE, YOUR COST

3446
02:24:57,255 --> 02:24:58,656
OF INTEREST.

3447
02:24:58,656 --> 02:25:00,358
IN THAT COMES DOWN, PEOPLE TALK

3448
02:25:00,358 --> 02:25:04,395
ABOUT THAT EQUITY, DEBT TO

3449
02:25:04,395 --> 02:25:05,229
REVENUE, THAT IS GROWTH.

3450
02:25:05,229 --> 02:25:06,530
IF YOUR DEBT SERVICE IS NOT HIGH

3451
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:09,967
BECAUSE OF WHERE YOUR RATE IS, I

3452
02:25:09,967 --> 02:25:14,105
WOULD ARGUE HIGH-YIELD IS NOT A

3453
02:25:14,105 --> 02:25:15,306
LOT OF INDUSTRY TIME.

3454
02:25:15,306 --> 02:25:16,874
WE TALKED ABOUT THE INDUSTRY

3455
02:25:16,874 --> 02:25:17,642
SECTOR HOW COMMODITIES MOVED

3456
02:25:17,642 --> 02:25:18,009
AROUND.

3457
02:25:18,009 --> 02:25:20,511
IT IS SOMETHING TO ARGUE.

3458
02:25:20,511 --> 02:25:24,081
JON: LET'S LOOK AT DEBT

3459
02:25:24,081 --> 02:25:26,818
SERVICING COSTS.

3460
02:25:26,818 --> 02:25:27,852
BGP IS LOOKING AT WHAT IS

3461
02:25:27,852 --> 02:25:31,989
HAPPENING WITH ITALIAN DEBT.

3462
02:25:31,989 --> 02:25:32,823
1.2% IS THE YIELD ON THE ITALIAN

3463
02:25:32,823 --> 02:25:35,526
10 YEAR, BUT THE STORY HAS BEEN

3464
02:25:35,526 --> 02:25:36,894
ALL-TIME RECORD LOW YIELDS AND

3465
02:25:36,894 --> 02:25:37,862
CONCERN ABOUT ITALIAN THANKS.

3466
02:25:37,862 --> 02:25:38,730
YOU SIT AT BLACKROCK.

3467
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:40,531
DOES BLACKROCK THINK YOU HAVE TO

3468
02:25:40,531 --> 02:25:43,801
BUILD IN A RISK PREMIUM TO

3469
02:25:43,801 --> 02:25:46,637
SPREAD, IF THE ITALIAN STATE

3470
02:25:46,637 --> 02:25:47,405
STEPS IN TO DO SOMETHING WITH

3471
02:25:47,405 --> 02:25:53,744
THE BANKS? 

3472
02:25:53,744 --> 02:25:54,545
RICK: THAT IS EQUIPPED TOUGH

3473
02:25:54,545 --> 02:25:55,012
QUESTION.

3474
02:25:55,012 --> 02:25:55,713
WE COULD TALK ABOUT ALL THE

3475
02:25:55,713 --> 02:25:56,447
RAMIFICATIONS, BUT THE TALENT

3476
02:25:56,447 --> 02:25:59,450
YOU BANKING SYSTEM, YOU HAVE --

3477
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:01,619
THE ITALIAN BANKING SYSTEM,

3478
02:26:01,619 --> 02:26:04,122
THERE ARE BANKS THAT ARE WELL

3479
02:26:04,122 --> 02:26:07,925
CAPITALIZED IN ITALY.

3480
02:26:07,925 --> 02:26:12,930
YOU HAVE WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC

3481
02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:14,865
SITUATION, IDIOSYNCRATIC

3482
02:26:14,865 --> 02:26:15,333
SITUATION.

3483
02:26:15,333 --> 02:26:16,000
HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.

3484
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,069
YOU HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP

3485
02:26:18,069 --> 02:26:19,103
IN OCTOBER.

3486
02:26:19,103 --> 02:26:19,971
ITALY WILL BE VOLATILE.

3487
02:26:19,971 --> 02:26:22,540
YOU HAVE AN INSURED AIRILY

3488
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:25,843
SUPPORTIVE ECB -- EXTRAORDINARY

3489
02:26:25,843 --> 02:26:30,247
SUPPORTIVE ECB.

3490
02:26:30,247 --> 02:26:32,216
WE THINK IT IS 120 GOING LOWER

3491
02:26:32,216 --> 02:26:33,684
BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT

3492
02:26:33,684 --> 02:26:36,954
THAT MR. DRAGHI HAS COMBINED.

3493
02:26:36,954 --> 02:26:38,823
WE THINK WE WILL HAVE SUPPORT OF

3494
02:26:38,823 --> 02:26:42,126
DYNAMICS AROUND ITALY.

3495
02:26:42,126 --> 02:26:44,162
WE THINK THERE IS A POSITIVE

3496
02:26:44,162 --> 02:26:45,696
COMING AROUND THE BANKING

3497
02:26:45,696 --> 02:26:47,165
SYSTEM, CAPITALIZATION WITH THE

3498
02:26:47,165 --> 02:26:49,066
BANKING SYSTEM, ABOUT THAT WILL

3499
02:26:49,066 --> 02:26:49,700
CONTINUE TO PLAY OUT.

3500
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:51,969
THERE IS VALUE IN SOME OF THOSE

3501
02:26:51,969 --> 02:26:54,071
BANKS, IN EUROPE BROADLY.

3502
02:26:54,071 --> 02:26:56,207
OR YOU TAKE IT WITH SENIOR RISK

3503
02:26:56,207 --> 02:26:57,808
OR EQUITY, BUT THERE IS VALUE

3504
02:26:57,808 --> 02:27:00,144
BECAUSE OF THE SYNCRETIC NATURE.

3505
02:27:00,144 --> 02:27:05,349
ALIX: SO WHERE? 

3506
02:27:05,349 --> 02:27:07,318
THAT GAP IS HUGE.

3507
02:27:07,318 --> 02:27:11,288
SENIOR DEBT IS PRETTY DO SEE --

3508
02:27:11,288 --> 02:27:11,689
JUICY.

3509
02:27:11,689 --> 02:27:12,757
WHERE DO YOU SEE IT? 

3510
02:27:12,757 --> 02:27:15,760
RICK: WE SPENT TIME LOOKING AT

3511
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:20,431
THE PLACES WE LIKE IS, I THINK

3512
02:27:20,431 --> 02:27:21,198
THERE IS AN EARNINGS DYNAMIC

3513
02:27:21,198 --> 02:27:25,135
THAT IS DIFFICULT.

3514
02:27:25,135 --> 02:27:25,903
THE U.K. DYNAMIC HAS TO PLAY

3515
02:27:25,903 --> 02:27:26,604
OUT, THERE IS NEAR-TERM

3516
02:27:26,604 --> 02:27:28,406
SOFTENING.

3517
02:27:28,406 --> 02:27:32,209
EUROPEAN DYNAMIC IS A BIT SOFTER

3518
02:27:32,209 --> 02:27:33,044
, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO WATCH OTHER

3519
02:27:33,044 --> 02:27:33,511
THINGS.

3520
02:27:33,511 --> 02:27:35,313
[SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY]

3521
02:27:35,313 --> 02:27:39,717
RICK: SO THAT BEING SAID, SOME

3522
02:27:39,717 --> 02:27:40,518
OF THE SUB DEBTS, SUBORDINATED

3523
02:27:40,518 --> 02:27:44,689
DEBT HAS BECOME ATTRACTIVE.

3524
02:27:44,689 --> 02:27:45,489
WE LOOK AT SOME OF THAT, I

3525
02:27:45,489 --> 02:27:49,660
LOOKED AT INDIVIDUAL NAMES.

3526
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:51,662
THEY HAVE GOTTEN OVERDONE, IN

3527
02:27:51,662 --> 02:27:52,496
PARTICULAR SUBORDINATED DEBT.

3528
02:27:52,496 --> 02:27:56,601
EQUITIES IS BETTER, THERE IS

3529
02:27:56,601 --> 02:27:57,034
VALUE.

3530
02:27:57,034 --> 02:27:58,536
THE BANKS ARE BETTER REGULATED,

3531
02:27:58,536 --> 02:28:01,305
BETTER CAPITALIZED, NO DOUBT,

3532
02:28:01,305 --> 02:28:02,173
EARNINGS ARE TOUGHER, BUT I

3533
02:28:02,173 --> 02:28:04,708
THINK THERE IS VALUE ON THE DEBT

3534
02:28:04,708 --> 02:28:05,476
SIDE OF SOME OF THESE BANKS.

3535
02:28:05,476 --> 02:28:10,181
DAVID: WE HAVE A REPORT ABOUT

3536
02:28:10,181 --> 02:28:10,648

EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS AND WHERE

3538
02:28:11,682 --> 02:28:12,450
THERE IS OPPORTUNITY AND THE

3539
02:28:12,450 --> 02:28:13,684
RISK TO IT.

3540
02:28:13,684 --> 02:28:18,155
RICK: PEOPLE IN THE U.S. LIKE TO

3541
02:28:18,155 --> 02:28:18,856
INVEST IN FIXED INCOME.

3542
02:28:18,856 --> 02:28:20,624
THAT IS WHAT ARE THEY HAVE KNOWN

3543

FOR 25 OR 30 YEARS.

3544
02:28:24,428 --> 02:28:25,262
IT IS A CONSISTENT LOWER RATE

3545
02:28:25,262 --> 02:28:28,266
DYNAMIC.

3546
02:28:28,266 --> 02:28:29,033
YOU CAN DISCUSS THE FEDERAL

3547
02:28:29,033 --> 02:28:29,900
NUMBER, THE U.S. IS BETTER THAN

3548
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:33,137
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

3549
02:28:33,137 --> 02:28:34,005
U.S. FIXED INCOME, THE FIRST

3550
02:28:34,005 --> 02:28:35,906
PART OF THE ROLLED THAT WILL

3551
02:28:35,906 --> 02:28:36,707
RAISE RATES VERY SLOWLY WILL BE

3552
02:28:36,707 --> 02:28:39,343
THE U.S. 

3553
02:28:39,343 --> 02:28:40,144
SOME OF THE GLOBAL FUNDS ARE

3554
02:28:40,144 --> 02:28:43,314
DOING EXTREMELY WELL BECAUSE OF

3555
02:28:43,314 --> 02:28:44,148
EXPOSURE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE

3556
02:28:44,148 --> 02:28:45,116
WORLD THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP

3557
02:28:45,116 --> 02:28:45,649
REDUCING RATES.

3558
02:28:45,649 --> 02:28:50,054
JAPAN WILL BE EASING, ECB WILL

3559
02:28:50,054 --> 02:28:50,488
BE EASING.

3560
02:28:50,488 --> 02:28:51,455
EMERGING MARKETS ARE GOING TO BE

3561
02:28:51,455 --> 02:28:52,289
EASIER TO GET THEIR ECONOMIES

3562
02:28:52,289 --> 02:28:55,393
REQUIRE IT.

3563
02:28:55,393 --> 02:28:56,193
SO PEOPLE SHOULD THINK ABOUT

3564
02:28:56,193 --> 02:28:57,795
INTEREST RATES IN THE U.S. ARE

3565
02:28:57,795 --> 02:28:59,997
LOW.

3566
02:28:59,997 --> 02:29:02,466
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

3567
02:29:02,466 --> 02:29:03,267
TRAJECTORY OF WHERE THE RATES

3568
02:29:03,267 --> 02:29:06,137
ARE GOING TO GO, WHERE THEY GO

3569
02:29:06,137 --> 02:29:09,473
HIGHER FIRST, IT IS THE U.S..

3570
02:29:09,473 --> 02:29:10,307
LOOK AT WHAT IS WORKED FOR ME,

RAMY: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE

3659
02:37:41,218 --> 02:37:44,922
OUR MARKETS ARE.

3660
02:37:44,922 --> 02:37:46,790
THE NASDAQ IS PUSHING HIGHER.

3661
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:51,161
WHEN THAT NUMBER CAME OUT

3662

3663
02:37:54,865 --> 02:37:57,167

3664
02:37:57,167 --> 02:37:57,901
IT BLEW OUT ALL BLOOMBERG

3665
02:37:57,901 --> 02:38:01,305

3666
02:38:01,305 --> 02:38:02,172
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS

3667
02:38:02,172 --> 02:38:02,906
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE

3668
02:38:02,906 --> 02:38:04,975

BLOOMBERG FOR THIS.

3670
02:38:08,345 --> 02:38:09,212
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN

3671
02:38:09,212 --> 02:38:09,913
HAPPENING POST BREXIT VOTE.

3672
02:38:09,913 --> 02:38:15,752
THE REASON FOR THIS CHART, I

3673
02:38:15,752 --> 02:38:16,520
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ALL OF

3674
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:18,722
OUR AVERAGES ARE UP ABOVE THE

3675
02:38:18,722 --> 02:38:24,628

WE HAVE RECOUPED ALL OF OUR

3680
02:38:36,006 --> 02:38:38,642
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE IMAP

3681
02:38:38,642 --> 02:38:42,613
AND THE S&P 500.

3682
02:38:42,613 --> 02:38:43,380
FINANCIALS ARE THE BIGGEST

3683
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:44,081
GAINER TODAY, UP BY 1.6%.

3684
02:38:44,081 --> 02:38:46,683
YESTERDAY THEY ONLY GAINED A

3685
02:38:46,683 --> 02:38:51,221
10TH OF A PERCENT OR SO, BUT

3686
02:38:51,221 --> 02:38:52,022
BECAUSE OF THE JOBS NUMBERS, WE

3687
02:38:52,022 --> 02:38:52,723

3688
02:38:52,723 --> 02:38:53,356
RALLY ACROSS THE BOARD.

3689

UTILITIES ON THE DOWNSIDE,

3692
02:39:01,298 --> 02:39:02,299
INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT

3693
02:39:02,299 --> 02:39:03,100
IS HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

3694
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:04,134
TALK ABOUT RATES.

3695
02:39:04,134 --> 02:39:06,436
LET'S GO DEEPER INTO FINANCIALS

3696
02:39:06,436 --> 02:39:07,170

3697
02:39:07,170 --> 02:39:08,205

3698
02:39:08,205 --> 02:39:10,807
JPMORGAN, YOU CAN SEE HERE, UP

3699
02:39:10,807 --> 02:39:13,410

3702
02:39:17,247 --> 02:39:20,784
OFF OF JOBS.

3703
02:39:20,784 --> 02:39:21,651
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS

3704
02:39:21,651 --> 02:39:23,520

I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DEAL

3711
02:39:35,999 --> 02:39:39,970
BETWEEN HUMANA AND AETNA.

3712
02:39:39,970 --> 02:39:44,007
BOTH OF THESE STOCKS NOW LOWER

3713
02:39:44,007 --> 02:39:44,741
BECAUSE JPMORGAN HAS CUT ITS

3714
02:39:44,741 --> 02:39:45,442
RATING TO NEUTRAL VERSUS

3715
02:39:45,442 --> 02:39:48,612
OVERWEIGHT.

3716
02:39:48,612 --> 02:39:49,446
JPMORGAN SAYING IT SEES A MUCH

3717
02:39:49,446 --> 02:39:50,347
LOWER PROBABILITY THAN A 50-50

3718
02:39:50,347 --> 02:39:53,416
CHANCE THAT THE DEAL IS GOING TO

3719
02:39:53,416 --> 02:39:54,484
BE APPROVED.

BREXIT VOTE AND THE STOXX 600

3727
02:40:07,531 --> 02:40:08,599

IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF AN UPBEAT

3860
02:44:57,087 --> 02:44:59,723
CONFUSION TO THE MARKET.

3861
02:44:59,723 --> 02:45:00,523
THIS WAS UPBEAT IN SOME WAYS,

3862
02:45:00,523 --> 02:45:01,324

THEY WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WAGE

3875

3876
02:45:24,381 --> 02:45:31,287
WHAT YOU  SHOULD SEE IS

3877
02:45:31,287 --> 02:45:32,122
SHORT MOVEMENT AT THE END OF THE

SHORT-TERM RELIEF BECAUSE  OF

3885
02:45:47,270 --> 02:45:48,071

3889
02:45:53,710 --> 02:45:55,478
THE PARTICIPATION RATE DID

3890
02:45:55,478 --> 02:45:57,847
INCREASE, WHICH IS GOOD, BUT

3891
02:45:57,847 --> 02:45:58,581
WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THE

3892
02:45:58,581 --> 02:45:59,082
FEDERAL RESERVE?

3893
02:45:59,082 --> 02:46:02,285
CAN THEY PUT A  RATE HIKE

3895
02:46:03,019 --> 02:46:09,859
MOHAMED: IT'S CERTAINLY IS

3896
02:46:09,859 --> 02:46:10,693
SAYING, LOOK, DO NOT ASSUME WE

3897
02:46:10,693 --> 02:46:13,463
ARE TOTALLY SIDELINE, BUT IT

3898
02:46:13,463 --> 02:46:15,498
DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE GOING TO

3899
02:46:15,498 --> 02:46:17,567
MOVE QUICKLY.

3900
02:46:17,567 --> 02:46:19,836
WITH THIS TYPES OF JOBS REPORT,

3901
02:46:19,836 --> 02:46:20,637
WE MAY END UP WITH ONE HIKE THIS

YEAR.

3903
02:46:22,939 --> 02:46:23,773
THIS IS AGAINST EXPECTATIONS

3904
02:46:23,773 --> 02:46:25,475
THAT HAD BASICALLY SIDELINED THE

3905
02:46:25,475 --> 02:46:26,576

3906
02:46:26,576 --> 02:46:35,018
MARK: EXPLAIN TO ME MAY.

3907
02:46:35,018 --> 02:46:35,885
IT HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO 11,000

3908
02:46:35,885 --> 02:46:37,620
FROM THE INITIAL FIGURE.

3909
02:46:37,620 --> 02:46:41,424
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN MAY AND DID

3910
02:46:41,424 --> 02:46:42,225
IT PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE

3911
02:46:42,225 --> 02:46:42,692
MAIN NUMBER?

3912
02:46:42,692 --> 02:46:44,728
MOHAMED: YES ON PUTTING TOO MUCH

3913
02:46:44,728 --> 02:46:46,997
WEIGHT.

3914
02:46:46,997 --> 02:46:47,830
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS

3915
02:46:47,830 --> 02:46:49,833
IS A VERY NOISY SERIES.

3916
02:46:49,833 --> 02:46:50,633
GETS REVISED A LOT.

3917
02:46:50,633 --> 02:46:53,703
WHAT I LIKE IS LOOKING AT

3918
02:46:53,703 --> 02:46:55,905
MONTHLY AVERAGES.

3919
02:46:55,905 --> 02:46:56,739
THE THREE-MONTH MOVING AVERAGES

3920
02:46:56,739 --> 02:46:59,709
ABOUT 147,000.

3921
02:46:59,709 --> 02:47:02,612
THE EQUILIBRIUM JOB CREATION IS

3922
02:47:02,612 --> 02:47:06,783
ABOUT 125-150,000.

3923
02:47:06,783 --> 02:47:08,651
THE ECONOMY IS PERFORMING AS YOU

3924
02:47:08,651 --> 02:47:09,452
WOULD EXPECT ON THE JOB CREATION

3925
02:47:09,452 --> 02:47:10,954
SIDE.

3926
02:47:10,954 --> 02:47:11,754
THE TWO AREAS TO LOOK VERY

3927
02:47:11,754 --> 02:47:12,655
CLOSELY AT HIS LABOR

3928
02:47:12,655 --> 02:47:13,790
PARTICIPATION.

3929
02:47:13,790 --> 02:47:16,292
WE NEED THAT TO  COME

3930
02:47:16,292 --> 02:47:21,131
BACK UP AND WAGE GROWTH.

3931
02:47:21,131 --> 02:47:21,931
FOR ME, THE MONTH-TO-MONTH IS

3932
02:47:21,931 --> 02:47:22,699
VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN WELL, BUT

3933
02:47:22,699 --> 02:47:24,867
THE TRENDS ARE THAT THIS ECONOMY

3934
02:47:24,867 --> 02:47:27,804
CONTINUES TO GROW AND IT IS NOT

3935
02:47:27,804 --> 02:47:29,272
GREAT, BUT IT'S OK.

3936
02:47:29,272 --> 02:47:32,842
MARK: I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT

3937
02:47:32,842 --> 02:47:33,877
THE REFERENDUM, THE BREXIT

3938
02:47:33,877 --> 02:47:34,711
REFERENDUM.

3939
02:47:34,711 --> 02:47:37,513
TO WHAT EXTENT IS BREXIT FROM

3940
02:47:37,513 --> 02:47:41,951
HERE ON IN AN OBSTACLE TO U.S.

3941
02:47:41,951 --> 02:47:42,585
POLICY NORMALIZATION?

3942
02:47:42,585 --> 02:47:45,822
MOHAMED: IT IS AN OBSTACLE

3943
02:47:45,822 --> 02:47:47,790
BECAUSE IT WILL REINFORCE THE

3944
02:47:47,790 --> 02:47:49,993
NOTION THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT

3945
02:47:49,993 --> 02:47:53,363
CONTROL ITS YIELD CURVE.

3946
02:47:53,363 --> 02:47:54,163
IT DOES CONTROL ITS ECONOMIC

3947
02:47:54,163 --> 02:47:54,864
DESTINY.

3948
02:47:54,864 --> 02:47:57,300
I DO NOT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT

3949
02:47:57,300 --> 02:47:58,001
THE ECONOMIC SPILLOVERS OF

3950
02:47:58,001 --> 02:48:00,236
BREXIT ON TO THE U.S. GROWTH.

3951
02:48:00,236 --> 02:48:01,004
I THINK IT IS A MEANINGFUL A

3952
02:48:01,004 --> 02:48:04,007
LIMIT FOR EUROPE -- ELEMENT FOR

3953
02:48:04,007 --> 02:48:05,008
EUROPE AND THE U.K..

3954
02:48:05,008 --> 02:48:09,112
THE NUMBER THAT YOU CITED ON

3955
02:48:09,112 --> 02:48:09,846
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS ONE

3956
02:48:09,846 --> 02:48:11,448
INSIGHT.

3957
02:48:11,448 --> 02:48:12,282
BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS GOING TO

3958
02:48:12,282 --> 02:48:14,217
COME DOWN A LOT IN THE U.K. TO

3959
02:48:14,217 --> 02:48:16,186
SEE WHAT EMERGES.

3960
02:48:16,186 --> 02:48:18,554
THIS IS A MAJOR ECONOMIC PROBLEM

3961
02:48:18,554 --> 02:48:19,589
FOR THE U.K. AND EUROPE.

3962
02:48:19,589 --> 02:48:20,356
IT IS LESS OF AN ECONOMIC

3963
02:48:20,356 --> 02:48:22,058
PROBLEM FOR THE U.S., BUT IT

3964
02:48:22,058 --> 02:48:27,297
WILL FURTHER DECOUPLE FINANCIAL

3965
02:48:27,297 --> 02:48:27,964
VARIABLES FROM ECONOMIC

3966
02:48:27,964 --> 02:48:28,364
VARIABLES.

3967
02:48:28,364 --> 02:48:32,602
VONNIE: WHAT HAPPENS TO RATES?

3968
02:48:32,602 --> 02:48:33,369
WE SEE THE SPREAD NOW AT 76

3969
02:48:33,369 --> 02:48:35,572
BASIS POINTS.

3970
02:48:35,572 --> 02:48:37,707
THAT IS MORE FLATTENING TODAY.

3971
02:48:37,707 --> 02:48:38,441
IT IS THE TWO-YEAR THAT IS

3972
02:48:38,441 --> 02:48:40,643
REALLY HELPING THAT.

3973
02:48:40,643 --> 02:48:41,678
DO WE GET EVEN MORE OF A

3974
02:48:41,678 --> 02:48:42,479
FLATTENING AND PERHAPS AN

3975
02:48:42,479 --> 02:48:45,982
INVERSION AT SOME POINT?

3976
02:48:45,982 --> 02:48:46,849
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE YIELD MORE

3977
02:48:46,849 --> 02:48:47,550
BROADLY AROUND THE WORLD?

3978
02:48:47,550 --> 02:48:49,452
MOHAMED: THAT IS A QUESTION

3979
02:48:49,452 --> 02:48:51,855
REALLY ABOUT EUROPE.

3980
02:48:51,855 --> 02:48:52,755
DOES EUROPE GET ITS ACT TOGETHER

3981
02:48:52,755 --> 02:48:54,557
POLITICALLY?

3982
02:48:54,557 --> 02:49:00,129
DOES THE U.K. AGREE WITH ITS

3983
02:49:00,129 --> 02:49:02,498
EUROPEAN PARTNERS ON SOMETHING

3984
02:49:02,498 --> 02:49:04,667
TO REPLACE FULL EU MEMBERSHIP?

3985
02:49:04,667 --> 02:49:07,637
IF IT DOES, THEN YOU WILL NOT

3986
02:49:07,637 --> 02:49:10,807
SEE MORE DRAMATIC FLATTENING OF

3987
02:49:10,807 --> 02:49:11,774
THE CURVE.

3988
02:49:11,774 --> 02:49:14,243
IF HOWEVER THERE IS NO PLAN B,

3989
02:49:14,243 --> 02:49:17,380
AS IS THE CASE RIGHT NOW, AND

3990
02:49:17,380 --> 02:49:20,583
THEY CANNOT GET THEIR ACT

3991
02:49:20,583 --> 02:49:21,384
TOGETHER POLITICALLY, YOU THEN

3992
02:49:21,384 --> 02:49:24,787
YOU WILL SEE ADVANCED ECONOMY

3993
02:49:24,787 --> 02:49:25,555
KURDS CONTINUE TO FLATTEN.

PURCHASES.

3997
02:49:36,299 --> 02:49:37,066
WE ARE GOING TO SEE ACTION

3998
02:49:37,066 --> 02:49:37,834
AROUND THE WORLD THE NEXT FEW

3999
02:49:37,834 --> 02:49:38,735
MONTHS, BUT THE NEXT SHOCKERS?

4000
02:49:38,735 --> 02:49:42,872
MOHAMED: THE BIGGEST SHOCKER

4001
02:49:42,872 --> 02:49:43,573
WOULD BE FOREIGN-EXCHANGE

INTERVENTION BY THE BANK OF

JAPAN.

4004
02:49:45,175 --> 02:49:45,908
THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST

4005
02:49:45,908 --> 02:49:48,144
SHOCKER.

4006
02:49:48,144 --> 02:49:49,078
I'VE BEEN LOOKING VERY CLOSELY

4007
02:49:49,078 --> 02:49:50,680
AS YOU HAVE AT WHAT HAS BEEN

4008
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:52,815
HAPPENING TO THE DOLLAR YEN.

02:49:57,954 --> 02:50:00,690
THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THIS 100

4012
02:50:00,690 --> 02:50:04,660
PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL, THE GREATER

4013
02:50:04,660 --> 02:50:05,428
THE PRESSURE ON THE BANK OF

4014
02:50:05,428 --> 02:50:12,535
JAPAN TO INTERVENE IN THE

4015
02:50:12,535 --> 02:50:13,469
FOREIGN EXTENT MARKET AND THAT'S

4016
02:50:13,469 --> 02:50:14,270
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME

4017
02:50:14,270 --> 02:50:17,207
AN EFFECTIVE.

4018
02:50:17,207 --> 02:50:18,007
LOOK FOR THE ECB TO DO MORE

4019
02:50:18,007 --> 02:50:21,778
QE AND LOOK FOR THE FED TO

4020
02:50:21,778 --> 02:50:23,846
WAIT AND SEE AT LEAST UNTIL

4021
02:50:23,846 --> 02:50:24,313
SEPTEMBER.

4022
02:50:24,313 --> 02:50:28,151
MARK: HOW LOW DOES STERLING

4023
02:50:28,151 --> 02:50:32,188
GO?

4024
02:50:32,188 --> 02:50:34,223
IS IT UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT IT

4025
02:50:34,223 --> 02:50:36,426
TO FALL TO THE LOWS IT SAW IN

4026
02:50:36,426 --> 02:50:37,260
1985, WHICH ARE THE LOWS GOING

4027
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:39,329
BACK TO 1971?

4028
02:50:39,329 --> 02:50:42,532
YOU WILL KNOW THAT.

4029
02:50:42,532 --> 02:50:43,399
IS INCONCEIVABLE TO THINK THAT

4030
02:50:43,399 --> 02:50:45,902
WE COULD GO TO THOSE  LOWS

4031
02:50:45,902 --> 02:50:46,436
OR EVEN PARITY?

4032
02:50:46,436 --> 02:50:50,907
MOHAMED: IT IS NOT

4033
02:50:50,907 --> 02:50:51,507
INCONCEIVABLE.

4034
02:50:51,507 --> 02:50:52,241
I WILL GIVE YOU THE SCENARIO

4035
02:50:52,241 --> 02:50:53,610
WHERE THAT HAPPENS.

4036
02:50:53,610 --> 02:50:54,377
IT IS BASICALLY MONTHS AND

4037
02:50:54,377 --> 02:50:56,579
MONTHS OF NO PROGRESS IN

4038
02:50:56,579 --> 02:50:57,380
REPLACING EU MEMBERSHIP WITH

4039
02:50:57,380 --> 02:51:00,650
SOME SORT OF FREE TRADE ZONE.

4040
02:51:00,650 --> 02:51:01,451
REMEMBER THAT BRITAIN IS GOING

4041
02:51:01,451 --> 02:51:05,321
THROUGH SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

4042
02:51:05,321 --> 02:51:06,122
UNUSUAL FOR AN ADVANCED ECONOMY,

4043
02:51:06,122 --> 02:51:06,856
WHICH IS WHEN YOU PUT UP THE

4044
02:51:06,856 --> 02:51:08,825
CURRENT ACCOUNT, BASICALLY

4045
02:51:08,825 --> 02:51:11,861
TRADE, AND THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT,

4046
02:51:11,861 --> 02:51:14,797
CAPITAL INFLOWS, AND PLAY.

4047
02:51:14,797 --> 02:51:15,598
IT HAS DONE THAT THROUGH THE

4048
02:51:15,598 --> 02:51:16,599
BREXIT VOTE.

4049
02:51:16,599 --> 02:51:17,366
IT HAS PUT ITS CURRENT AND

4050
02:51:17,366 --> 02:51:21,804
CAPITAL ACCOUNT IN PLAY.

4051
02:51:21,804 --> 02:51:22,605
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS IN NO

4052
02:51:22,605 --> 02:51:23,439
POSITION TO RAISE INTEREST RATES

4053
02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:24,106

4054
02:51:24,106 --> 02:51:24,474
MARKET.

4055
02:51:24,474 --> 02:51:29,779
IT IS CONCEIVABLE IF PLAN B DOES

4056
02:51:29,779 --> 02:51:31,481
NOT EMERGE QUICKLY.

4057
02:51:31,481 --> 02:51:35,485

SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF FREE TRADE

4059

LITTLE BIT AND THEN COMMERCIAL

4066
02:51:46,462 --> 02:51:50,566
WE ARE SEEING A FOR STEALING OF

THAT SECTOR.

4068
02:51:51,601 --> 02:51:55,805
IT IS A SECTOR THAT OVERPROMISED

4069
02:51:55,805 --> 02:51:56,606
LIQUIDITY.

4070
02:51:56,606 --> 02:52:04,614

03:00:40,796 --> 03:00:44,667
HOPE THAT WHAT THEY TRACK, THE

4196
03:00:44,667 --> 03:00:45,467

03:00:46,201 --> 03:00:46,635
OTHER WAYS.

4199
03:00:46,635 --> 03:00:48,971
THAT IS WHY ETF GROWTH HAS NOT

4200
03:00:48,971 --> 03:00:51,173
BEEN FASTER.

4201
03:00:51,173 --> 03:00:53,742
SOME PEOPLE SAY ETF'S ARE 

4202
03:00:53,742 --> 03:00:54,243
BUT NOT SOLD.

4203
03:00:54,243 --> 03:01:00,049
VONNIE: THE TREND WENT FROM

03:01:00,049 --> 03:01:01,517
PASSIVE TO ACTIVE AND IT LOOKS

4205
03:01:01,517 --> 03:01:02,351
LIKE WE ARE RETURNING TO SORT OF

4206
03:01:02,351 --> 03:01:03,018
THE PASSIVE TREND AGAIN.

4207
03:01:03,018 --> 03:01:03,552
IS THAT THE CASE?

4208
03:01:03,552 --> 03:01:07,456
ERIC: YES.

4209
03:01:07,456 --> 03:01:08,290
IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR, YOU

03:01:08,290 --> 03:01:12,228
CAN SEE $76 BILLION OUT.

4211

OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, WE

PASSIVE.

4215
03:01:18,567 --> 03:01:19,401
THE REASON YOU HAVE NOT HEARD

4216
03:01:19,401 --> 03:01:21,437
MORE ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE THE

4217
03:01:21,437 --> 03:01:22,237
STOCK MARKET HAS GONE UP IN THE

4218
03:01:22,237 --> 03:01:24,874
TREASURY MARKET HAS GONE UP.

THE ACTUAL COMPANIES THAT ISSUE

4220
03:01:25,707 --> 03:01:27,843
THIS STUFF ARE LOSING REVENUE.

4221
03:01:27,843 --> 03:01:28,710
IT HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY THE FACT

4222
03:01:28,710 --> 03:01:30,613
THAT THE MARKET IS GOING UP.

4223
03:01:30,613 --> 03:01:31,380
YOU WILL SEE ASSET MANAGERS

4224
03:01:31,380 --> 03:01:35,951
FEELING PAIN IN TERMS OF PEOPLE

4225
03:01:35,951 --> 03:01:36,685
MOVING TO PASSIVE, WHICH

4226
03:01:36,685 --> 03:01:38,487
REPRESENTS A 70% CUT IN REVENUE.

4227
03:01:38,487 --> 03:01:40,089
THEY CHARGED 20 BASIS POINTS AND

4228
03:01:40,089 --> 03:01:41,423
ACTIVE PRODUCTS CHARGE 80 BASIS

4229
03:01:41,423 --> 03:01:42,024
POINTS ON AVERAGE.

4230
03:01:42,024 --> 03:01:45,661
VONNIE: ETF'S ARE BACKED BY HARD

WHAT ARE THE HARD ASSETS WE

INTERESTING PRODUCTS.

THERE IS A SPAGHETTI THING GOING

03:09:27,989 --> 03:09:30,726
INTO THE EYES.

4378
03:09:30,726 --> 03:09:31,459
THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

4379
03:09:31,459 --> 03:09:34,795
PROBLEMS WITH THE ITALIAN BANKS

4380
03:09:34,795 --> 03:09:37,733
.

4381
03:09:37,733 --> 03:09:38,667
THE FED DOESN'T, BUT THE ECB AND

4382
03:09:38,667 --> 03:09:41,737
THE EU DO.

4383
03:09:41,737 --> 03:09:42,604
THERE IS A SENSE OF ILLIQUIDITY

4384
03:09:42,604 --> 03:09:47,642
AND MARKETS AND THE FED IS VERY

4385
03:09:47,642 --> 03:09:48,477
OBSESSED AND CONCERNED WITH

4386
03:09:48,477 --> 03:09:50,412
MARKETS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

4387
03:09:50,412 --> 03:09:53,715
IS DISCORD AROUND THE WORLD.

4388
03:09:53,715 --> 03:09:54,549
I THINK THE FED STAYS WHERE IT

4389
03:09:54,549 --> 03:09:56,952
IS.

4390
03:09:56,952 --> 03:09:57,686
THE HAVE WANTED TO RAISE

4391
03:09:57,686 --> 03:09:58,219
INTEREST RATES.

4392
03:09:58,219 --> 03:10:03,024
THEY DID IT ONCE AND I THINK

4393
03:10:03,024 --> 03:10:03,792
THEY WANT TO HAVE US BELIEVE

4394
03:10:03,792 --> 03:10:04,526
THAT THEY WILL RAISE SEVERAL

4395
03:10:04,526 --> 03:10:05,560
TIMES AND THEREFORE HAVE A

4396
03:10:05,560 --> 03:10:06,328
PRETTY POSITIVE YIELD CURVE,

4397
03:10:06,328 --> 03:10:09,564
WHICH WILL  HELP BANKS AND

4398
03:10:09,564 --> 03:10:12,067
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

4399
03:10:12,067 --> 03:10:12,867
FOR THE MOST PART, I DO NOT

4400
03:10:12,867 --> 03:10:13,535
THINK THIS CHANGES MUCH.

4401
03:10:13,535 --> 03:10:16,972
>> JUST TO CLARIFY -- YOUR CALL

4402
03:10:16,972 --> 03:10:17,739
IS FOR HOW MANY RATE MOVES THIS

4403
03:10:17,739 --> 03:10:18,073
YEAR?

4404
03:10:18,073 --> 03:10:20,709
BILL: THE MARKET ONLY CALLS FOR

4405
03:10:20,709 --> 03:10:23,178
A HALF IN THE NEXT MONTH AND

4406
03:10:23,178 --> 03:10:25,413
BEYOND THAT, ANOTHER HALF, SO 12

4407
03:10:25,413 --> 03:10:26,748
BASIS POINTS EACH.

4408
03:10:26,748 --> 03:10:29,718
THAT IS THE MARKET.

4409
03:10:29,718 --> 03:10:33,054
I THINK THEY TRY TO RAISE ONCE

4410
03:10:33,054 --> 03:10:33,788
AND IF THEY CONTINUE TO GET

4411
03:10:33,788 --> 03:10:35,624
EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS LIKE THIS AND

4412
03:10:35,624 --> 03:10:36,758
IF THEY CAN GET THOSE WAGES UP,

4413
03:10:36,758 --> 03:10:38,893
THEN PERHAPS THEY WILL HAVE

4414
03:10:38,893 --> 03:10:41,096
THEIR CHANCE LATER IN THE YEAR.

4415
03:10:41,096 --> 03:10:41,930
I THINK THEY REALLY DO WANT TO

4416
03:10:41,930 --> 03:10:42,798
RAISE RATES.

4417
03:10:42,798 --> 03:10:46,768
SOME OF THEM LIKE BULLARD AND

4418
03:10:46,768 --> 03:10:48,870
EVANS HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY

4419
03:10:48,870 --> 03:10:50,605
NEED HIGHER INTEREST RATES IN

4420
03:10:50,605 --> 03:10:52,574
ORDER TO BALANCE OUT THE SAVINGS

4421
03:10:52,574 --> 03:10:54,009
VERSUS INVESTMENT ELEMENT IN THE

4422
03:10:54,009 --> 03:10:54,476
ECONOMY.

4423
03:10:54,476 --> 03:10:58,847
>> BILL GROSS, WITHOUT QUESTION

4424
03:10:58,847 --> 03:10:59,614
IN OUR LIFETIMES, THIS IS THE

4425
03:10:59,614 --> 03:11:02,050
MOST PRICED TO PERFECTION BOND

4426
03:11:02,050 --> 03:11:03,885
MARKET WE HAVE EVER SEEN.

4427
03:11:03,885 --> 03:11:06,054
HAS YOUR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE

4428
03:11:06,054 --> 03:11:09,057
CHANGED?

4429
03:11:09,057 --> 03:11:12,027
THE YIELD GOES FROM 139 TO 141.

4430
03:11:12,027 --> 03:11:14,629
THAT THESE ARE SHOCKING YIELDS

4431
03:11:14,629 --> 03:11:17,232
AND SHOCKING BOND VALUATIONS.

4432
03:11:17,232 --> 03:11:18,033
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DAY-TO-DAY

4433
03:11:18,033 --> 03:11:19,901
WITH THINNESS MALIA -- WITHIN

4434
03:11:19,901 --> 03:11:22,404
THIS MILIEU?

4435
03:11:22,404 --> 03:11:24,906
BILL: I DO NOT THINK IT IS

4436
03:11:24,906 --> 03:11:27,008
PRICED TO PERFECTION.

4437
03:11:27,008 --> 03:11:32,314
IT IS PRICED TO ABSURDITY.

4438
03:11:32,314 --> 03:11:33,148
ONE NOTE THAT $12 TRILLION WORTH

4439
03:11:33,148 --> 03:11:34,849
OF SOVEREIGN BONDS IN NEGATIVE

4440
03:11:34,849 --> 03:11:38,920
YIELD SPACE, THERE IS ONE NOTE

4441
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:39,688
IN GERMANY THAT THE ECB CANNOT

4442
03:11:39,688 --> 03:11:42,023
REALLY BUY 40% OF GERMAN BONDS

4443
03:11:42,023 --> 03:11:42,857
BECAUSE THEY ARE YIELDING LESS

4444
03:11:42,857 --> 03:11:48,396
THAN 40 BASIS POINTS.

4445
03:11:48,396 --> 03:11:49,230
IN JAPAN, THERE IS EVEN THE 40

4446
03:11:49,230 --> 03:11:51,333
YEAR JGB.

4447
03:11:51,333 --> 03:11:53,168
SO IT'S AN ABSURD MARKET.

4448
03:11:53,168 --> 03:11:56,371
WHAT DO YOU DO IS THE QUESTION.

4449
03:11:56,371 --> 03:11:57,205
YOU OBVIOUSLY DO NOT BUY THOSE

4450
03:11:57,205 --> 03:11:58,139
BONDS.

4451
03:11:58,139 --> 03:12:03,945
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CHAIRMAN

4452
03:12:03,945 --> 03:12:05,714
OF BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES

4453
03:12:05,714 --> 03:12:06,548
HAVE TO BUY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

4454
03:12:06,548 --> 03:12:09,918
PUT THEIR MONEY 

4455
03:12:09,918 --> 03:12:10,685
SOMEWHERE, SO YOU LOOK FOR

4456
03:12:10,685 --> 03:12:11,419
SUBSTITUTES IN SOME KIND OF

4457
03:12:11,419 --> 03:12:11,853
CERTAINTY.

4458
03:12:11,853 --> 03:12:13,121
VONNIE: THAT MEANS BUYING

4459
03:12:13,121 --> 03:12:14,155
MORTGAGES AND SELLING OPTIONS.

4460
03:12:14,155 --> 03:12:21,162
MARK: WHILE THE U.S. JOB MARKET

4461
03:12:21,162 --> 03:12:21,930
REBOUNDS, FEARS ARE GROWING

4462
03:12:21,930 --> 03:12:23,131
ABOUT THE U.K. ECONOMY.

4463
03:12:23,131 --> 03:12:27,135
MANY COLUMNIST THINK THE

4464
03:12:27,135 --> 03:12:27,902
THREAT OF RECESSION IS VERY

4465
03:12:27,902 --> 03:12:28,503
STRONG.

4466
03:12:28,503 --> 03:12:29,404
WE ARE JOINED BY PETER FROM

4467
03:12:29,404 --> 03:12:30,338
VANGUARD.

4468
03:12:30,338 --> 03:12:35,043
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

4469
03:12:35,043 --> 03:12:35,777
WE HAD DATA ON CONSUMER

4470
03:12:35,777 --> 03:12:36,544
CONFIDENCE PLUNGING THE MOST IN

4471
03:12:36,544 --> 03:12:36,945
21 YEARS.

4472
03:12:36,945 --> 03:12:39,114
WE HAD BUSINESS CONFIDENCE DATA

4473
03:12:39,114 --> 03:12:42,751
YESTERDAY PLUNGING POST BREXIT.

4474
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:43,585
HOW IS THIS SOFT DATA GOING TO

4475
03:12:43,585 --> 03:12:46,321
TRANSLATE TO THE HARD DATA?

4476
03:12:46,321 --> 03:12:48,790
WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE MUCH OF

4477
03:12:48,790 --> 03:12:49,591
IT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST.

4478
03:12:49,591 --> 03:12:52,660
PETER: I THINK IT IS GOING TO

4479
03:12:52,660 --> 03:12:53,428
TRANSLATE PRETTY MUCH DIRECTLY.

4480
03:12:53,428 --> 03:12:56,698
I THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

4481
03:12:56,698 --> 03:12:57,499
SEE WHY ANY FIRMS ARE GOING TO

4482
03:12:57,499 --> 03:12:59,434
BE INVESTING AT THE MOMENT WHILE

4483
03:12:59,434 --> 03:13:00,168
THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY

4484
03:13:00,168 --> 03:13:00,735
AROUND THIS.

4485
03:13:00,735 --> 03:13:01,603
THERE'S AN OPTION VALUE FOR

4486
03:13:01,603 --> 03:13:07,442
WAITING IF YOU LOOK, SO ANY FIRM

4487
03:13:07,442 --> 03:13:08,309
THAT IS THINKING ABOUT A PROJECT

4488
03:13:08,309 --> 03:13:09,010
OR THE CONSUMER MAKING A BIG

4489
03:13:09,010 --> 03:13:11,513
PURCHASE LIKE EVEN HOUSING, WHY

4490
03:13:11,513 --> 03:13:13,582
WOULD YOU DO THAT AT THE MOMENT?

4491
03:13:13,582 --> 03:13:15,884
I THINK IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT

4492
03:13:15,884 --> 03:13:16,651
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE U.K.

4493
03:13:16,651 --> 03:13:17,252
GOING INTO RECESSION.

4494
03:13:17,252 --> 03:13:18,720
MARK: THERE IS RECESSION AND

4495
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:24,225
THEM THERE IS A RECESSION.

4496
03:13:24,225 --> 03:13:24,926
GIVE US A THOUGHT OF THE

4497
03:13:24,926 --> 03:13:25,727
RECESSION THAT THE U.K. MIGHT

4498
03:13:25,727 --> 03:13:26,895
EXPERIENCE THIS YEAR OR NEXT

4499
03:13:26,895 --> 03:13:27,295
YEAR.

4500
03:13:27,295 --> 03:13:31,766
PETER: THIS IS ALL FINGER IN THE

4501
03:13:31,766 --> 03:13:32,600
AIR STUFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT

4502
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:33,401
ANYTHING TO COMPARE IT AGAINST.

4503
03:13:33,401 --> 03:13:36,638
WE COULD SEE U.K. GDP FALLING BY

4504
03:13:36,638 --> 03:13:38,873
A QUARTER PERCENT.

4505
03:13:38,873 --> 03:13:43,745
PROBABLY YEAR ON YEAR, 2016,

4506
03:13:43,745 --> 03:13:46,147
2017 ARE GOING TO SEE FLAT GDP.

4507
03:13:46,147 --> 03:13:46,915
WE WILL TECHNICALLY HAVE A

4508
03:13:46,915 --> 03:13:47,849
RECESSION, BUT IT COULD BE A LOT

4509
03:13:47,849 --> 03:13:51,853
WORSE THAN THAT.

4510
03:13:51,853 --> 03:13:54,255
CERTAINLY SOME OF THE FORECASTS

4511
03:13:54,255 --> 03:13:55,023
WERE MADE BEFORE THE REVEREND

4512
03:13:55,023 --> 03:13:58,893
WERE BEING DISMISSED AS FEAR AND

4513
03:13:58,893 --> 03:13:59,861
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT NOW.

4514
03:13:59,861 --> 03:14:04,199
VONNIE: WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF

4515
03:14:04,199 --> 03:14:07,469
THE CENTRAL BANKS OF THE WORLD?

4516
03:14:07,469 --> 03:14:08,236
WHERE ARE YOU ANTICIPATING

4517
03:14:08,236 --> 03:14:09,003
ACTION THAT MIGHT GET THE BALL

4518
03:14:09,003 --> 03:14:09,404
ROLLING?

4519
03:14:09,404 --> 03:14:14,242
PETER: OBVIOUSLY CLOSEST TO

4520
03:14:14,242 --> 03:14:15,143
HOME, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE

4521
03:14:15,143 --> 03:14:15,844
THE U.K. CUT INTEREST RATES

4522
03:14:15,844 --> 03:14:18,380
LATER THIS YEAR.

4523
03:14:18,380 --> 03:14:19,180
MARK CARNEY HAS ALREADY GIVEN

4524
03:14:19,180 --> 03:14:21,583
THAT THEY CAN'T ABOUT THAT. -- A

4525
03:14:21,583 --> 03:14:24,085
BIG HINT ABOUT THAT.

4526
03:14:24,085 --> 03:14:27,622
I THINK THE ECB IS VERY LIKELY

4527
03:14:27,622 --> 03:14:29,224
TO NEED TO EXTEND QE PURCHASES

4528
03:14:29,224 --> 03:14:30,125
BEYOND MARCH NEXT YEAR.

4529
03:14:30,125 --> 03:14:32,827
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE SEEING THE FED

4530
03:14:32,827 --> 03:14:33,661
HOLDING FIRE ON RAISING INTEREST

4531
03:14:33,661 --> 03:14:36,898
RATES, BUT I THINK THAT STRONG

4532
03:14:36,898 --> 03:14:40,134
JOBS NUMBER MEANS THERE'S GOING

4533
03:14:40,134 --> 03:14:40,902
TO BE A BIT OF A FIGHT ON THE

4534
03:14:40,902 --> 03:14:43,738
ONE HAND BETWEEN THE GLOOMY

4535
03:14:43,738 --> 03:14:46,107
GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE ARE

4536
03:14:46,107 --> 03:14:49,210
IN, BUT THE STRENGTHENING U.S.

4537
03:14:49,210 --> 03:14:53,715
DATA, NOT JUST THE JOBS TODAY,

4538
03:14:53,715 --> 03:14:54,349
BUT WE ARE SEEING CORE

4539
03:14:54,349 --> 03:14:55,116
INFLATION, WHICH I THINK IS THE

4540
03:14:55,116 --> 03:14:57,051
THING YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

4541
03:14:57,051 --> 03:15:00,488
GOING ABOUT THE 2% TARGET.

4542
03:15:00,488 --> 03:15:03,258
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT PROBABLY NOT

4543
03:15:03,258 --> 03:15:04,726
SEPTEMBER BUT BY DECEMBER THAT

4544
03:15:04,726 --> 03:15:05,426
THERE'S GOING TO BE A

4545
03:15:05,426 --> 03:15:06,194
STRENGTHENING CASE FOR THE U.S.

4546
03:15:06,194 --> 03:15:06,828
TO DO SOMETHING AS WELL.

4547
03:15:06,828 --> 03:15:08,329
VONNIE: CAN BRITAIN STAVE OFF

4548
03:15:08,329 --> 03:15:11,766
RECESSION EITHER THROUGH THE

4549
03:15:11,766 --> 03:15:12,467
BANK OF ENGLAND ACTIONS OR

4550
03:15:12,467 --> 03:15:13,134
THROUGH SOME OTHER WAY?

4551
03:15:13,134 --> 03:15:17,272
PETER: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

4552
03:15:17,272 --> 03:15:21,242
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

4553
03:15:21,242 --> 03:15:22,043
OBVIOUSLY THE 10% DEPRECIATION

4554
03:15:22,043 --> 03:15:22,844
AND STERLING IS GOING TO BE A

4555
03:15:22,844 --> 03:15:24,846
BIT OF A BUFFER.

4556
03:15:24,846 --> 03:15:25,647
THE BANK OF ENGLAND MEASURES

4557
03:15:25,647 --> 03:15:26,414
THAT I TALKED ABOUT WILL HELP

4558
03:15:26,414 --> 03:15:30,285
AND WE HAVE NOW HEARD THAT THE

4559
03:15:30,285 --> 03:15:31,085
U.K. GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO EASE

4560
03:15:31,085 --> 03:15:33,788
UP ON AUSTERITY MEASURES.

4561
03:15:33,788 --> 03:15:34,622
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE SAW A

4562
03:15:34,622 --> 03:15:38,493
BIG FISCAL STIMULUS FROM THE

4563
03:15:38,493 --> 03:15:39,294
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT, BUT I

4564
03:15:39,294 --> 03:15:40,028
THINK ALL THOSE THINGS WILL

4565
03:15:40,028 --> 03:15:41,396
HELP, BUT I DO NOT THINK THEY

4566
03:15:41,396 --> 03:15:42,430
WILL BE ENOUGH COLLECTIVELY TO

4567
03:15:42,430 --> 03:15:46,334
STEM THE SCALE OF THE DOWNTURN

4568
03:15:46,334 --> 03:15:47,101
IN SENTIMENT WE ARE LIKELY TO

4569
03:15:47,101 --> 03:15:47,402
SEE.

4570
03:15:47,402 --> 03:15:49,471
MARK: HOW MUCH FURTHER WILL BE

4571
03:15:49,471 --> 03:15:53,942
SEE STERLING DECLINE, PETER?

4572
03:15:53,942 --> 03:15:54,742
I KNOW IT IS THE $50 BILLION

4573
03:15:54,742 --> 03:15:55,510
QUESTION THAT NOW.

4574
03:15:55,510 --> 03:15:57,011
COULD WE GO BELOW 120?

4575
03:15:57,011 --> 03:16:00,415
PETER: IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS.

4576
03:16:00,415 --> 03:16:03,718
THE MOMENTUM ALONE IS BEING

4577
03:16:03,718 --> 03:16:05,487
DRIVEN BY PURE SENTIMENT.

4578
03:16:05,487 --> 03:16:07,455
IF YOU STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT

4579
03:16:07,455 --> 03:16:08,523
THE FUNDAMENTALS, YOU REALLY

4580
03:16:08,523 --> 03:16:09,357
NEED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

4581
03:16:09,357 --> 03:16:10,191
GOING TO BE A SEVERE

4582
03:16:10,191 --> 03:16:11,092
DETERIORATION IN THE U.K. TRADE

4583
03:16:11,092 --> 03:16:13,194
TO WARRANT A SHIFT IN THE

4584
03:16:13,194 --> 03:16:16,431
EXCHANGE RATE.

4585
03:16:16,431 --> 03:16:19,334
AT THE MOMENT, WE DO NOT KNOW

4586
03:16:19,334 --> 03:16:20,201
WHAT THOSE TRADING RELATIONSHIPS

4587
03:16:20,201 --> 03:16:21,002
ARE GOING TO BE BETWEEN THE U.K.

4588
03:16:21,002 --> 03:16:23,638
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.

4589
03:16:23,638 --> 03:16:25,340
THAT IS THE MOST PERNICIOUS

4590
03:16:25,340 --> 03:16:27,842
ASPECT OF THIS AT THE MOMENT

4591
03:16:27,842 --> 03:16:31,179
.

4592
03:16:31,179 --> 03:16:32,113
THEY'RE STILL VERY FEW SPECIFICS

4593
03:16:32,113 --> 03:16:32,981
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO DO WHAT.

4594
03:16:32,981 --> 03:16:36,284
MARK: IS IT GOOD FOR THE CURRENT

4595
03:16:36,284 --> 03:16:37,051
ACCOUNT OR BAD FOR THE CURRENT

4596
03:16:37,051 --> 03:16:38,052
ACCOUNT?

4597
03:16:38,052 --> 03:16:38,820
WE DO KNOW THAT THE CURRENT

4598
03:16:38,820 --> 03:16:40,455
ACCOUNT DEFICIT IS ALMOST AT A

4599
03:16:40,455 --> 03:16:43,792
RECORD LOW.

4600
03:16:43,792 --> 03:16:45,293
IS A GOOD OR IS IT BAD?

4601
03:16:45,293 --> 03:16:48,863
PETER: WEEK STERLING WOULD BE

4602
03:16:48,863 --> 03:16:49,664
GOOD, BUT THE UNDERLYING SHOCK,

4603
03:16:49,664 --> 03:16:53,901
WHICH IS  AN ALMOST CERTAIN

4604
03:16:53,901 --> 03:16:54,869
DETERIORATION IN OUR ABILITY TO

4605
03:16:54,869 --> 03:16:58,973
TRADE WITH THE EURO AREA AND

4606
03:16:58,973 --> 03:16:59,774
PROBABLY WITH THE REST OF THE

4607
03:16:59,774 --> 03:17:01,976
WORLD AS WELL, THAT'S GOING TO

4608
03:17:01,976 --> 03:17:03,077
TAKE A LONG TIME TO SORT OUT.

4609
03:17:03,077 --> 03:17:03,878
I THINK ALL THOSE THINGS ARE

4610
03:17:03,878 --> 03:17:08,649
GOING TO MAKE THE CURRENT

4611
03:17:08,649 --> 03:17:09,384
ACCOUNT WORSE THAN IT IS

4612
03:17:09,384 --> 03:17:09,817
ALREADY.

-- COLD WAR BACK?

4619
03:17:24,966 --> 03:17:34,209
U.S.-RUSSIA RELATIONS ARE

4620
03:17:34,209 --> 03:17:36,344
TENSE.

4621
03:17:36,344 --> 03:17:37,212

REPORT.

4629
03:19:58,886 --> 03:20:00,021
ITALY'S BANKS ARE GETTING

4630
03:20:00,021 --> 03:20:00,788
DESPERATE AND THE BANK OF A

4631
03:20:00,788 --> 03:20:02,723
LEASE GOVERNORS SAY INTERVENTION

4632
03:20:02,723 --> 03:20:08,262
MAY BE NECESSARY.

4635
03:20:10,331 --> 03:20:10,798
NECESSARY.

VONNIE: ARE THE U.S. AND RUSSIA

4639
03:20:19,006 --> 03:20:21,843
ENTERING A NEW COLD WAR?

4640
03:20:21,843 --> 03:20:26,280
WE BEGIN IN ITALY WHERE THE BANK

4641
03:20:26,280 --> 03:20:28,182
SAYS IT IS WORKING INTENSELY

4642
03:20:28,182 --> 03:20:28,983
WITH AUTHORITIES ON A SOLUTION

4643
03:20:28,983 --> 03:20:30,218
FOR ITS BAD LOANS.

4644
03:20:30,218 --> 03:20:31,052
IT IS SAID TO BE THE SUBJECT OF

4645
03:20:31,052 --> 03:20:36,423
BAILOUT TALKS THAT HAVE LED TO A

4646
03:20:36,423 --> 03:20:38,960
 DEADLOCK.

4647
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:42,463
THE BANK WANTS TO OFFLOAD 40% OF

4648
03:20:42,463 --> 03:20:43,264
ITS NONPERFORMING LOANS BY 2018.

4649
03:20:43,264 --> 03:20:47,402
THE BANK OF ITALY GOVERNOR SAYS

4650
03:20:47,402 --> 03:20:48,236
STATE INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT

4651
03:20:48,236 --> 03:20:49,036
BATTALION BANKS MAY BE NEEDED.

EARLIER ON BLOOMBERG, CITIGROUP

4653
03:20:54,041 --> 03:20:57,211
SAID THAT THE BANKING PROBLEM

4654
03:20:57,211 --> 03:20:58,012
GOES BEYOND THE BALANCE SHEET.

4655
03:20:58,012 --> 03:21:01,015
>> POLICY IN ITALY IS

4656
03:21:01,015 --> 03:21:05,153
THREATENING TODAY AS THE U.K.

4657
03:21:05,153 --> 03:21:07,121
POLITICS WERE THREATENING SIX

4658
03:21:07,121 --> 03:21:10,591
MONTHS OR YEAR AGO.

4659
03:21:10,591 --> 03:21:11,492
I'M AM MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE

4660
03:21:11,492 --> 03:21:12,260
POLITICS THAN THE BANKS PER SE.

4661
03:21:12,260 --> 03:21:15,896
MARK: THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

4662
03:21:15,896 --> 03:21:18,199
HAS IMPOSED TOUGH NEW RULES FOR

4663
03:21:18,199 --> 03:21:21,235
OIL COMPANIES, ONES WHO WANT TO

4664
03:21:21,235 --> 03:21:23,504
DRILL IN ARCTIC WATERS.

4665
03:21:23,504 --> 03:21:24,305
DRILLERS WOULD HAVE TO STASH

4666
03:21:24,305 --> 03:21:28,309
EQUIPMENT NEARBY AND HAVE TO

4667
03:21:28,309 --> 03:21:29,076
TAKE COSTLY POTENTIAL STEPS

4668
03:21:29,076 --> 03:21:29,877
DESIGNED TO PREVENT OIL SPILLS.

4669
03:21:29,877 --> 03:21:31,512
THE ENERGY INDUSTRY SAYS THE

4670
03:21:31,512 --> 03:21:34,449
RULES WILL DISCOURAGE THE

4671
03:21:34,449 --> 03:21:36,684
 DEVELOPMENT.

4672
03:21:36,684 --> 03:21:37,518
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE PUTTING

4673
03:21:37,518 --> 03:21:41,522
PRESSURE ON BOEING ON ITS

4674
03:21:41,522 --> 03:21:42,223
HISTORIC AGREEMENT TO SELL

4675
03:21:42,223 --> 03:21:43,024

03:21:43,024 --> 03:21:43,391

THE HOUSE IS PUTTING OUT

4678
03:21:46,027 --> 03:21:49,330
LEGISLATION TO BLOCK THE SALE.

4679
03:21:49,330 --> 03:21:51,932
THE BOEING DEAL WOULD BE THE

4680
03:21:51,932 --> 03:21:53,601
BIGGEST BUSINESS TRANSACTION

4681
03:21:53,601 --> 03:21:54,402
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN SINCE

4682
03:21:54,402 --> 03:21:55,336
THE 1979 REVOLUTION.

4683
03:21:55,336 --> 03:21:57,305
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAID IT

4684
03:21:57,305 --> 03:22:03,811
WILL  VETO ANY LEGISLATION

4685
03:22:03,811 --> 03:22:04,612
THAT WILL UNDERMINE THE NUCLEAR

4686
03:22:04,612 --> 03:22:05,179
AGREEMENT WITH IRAN.

4687
03:22:05,179 --> 03:22:08,349
AT ONE POINT TO -- A $1.2

4688
03:22:08,349 --> 03:22:10,351
BILLION DEAL FOR A LONG.

4689
03:22:10,351 --> 03:22:14,288
THE RIGHT HIT -- THE RIGHT

4690
03:22:14,288 --> 03:22:18,159
HAILING APP HAS RAISED DEAL ON

4691
03:22:18,159 --> 03:22:18,592

4692
03:22:18,592 --> 03:22:23,998
VONNIE: TIME NOW FOR OUR

4693

DIVIDE CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND ON

4695
03:22:26,834 --> 03:22:28,936
ISSUES OF INTEREST.

4696
03:22:28,936 --> 03:22:29,837
IS A COLD WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND

4697
03:22:29,837 --> 03:22:30,605
THE UNITED STATES BACK?

4698
03:22:30,605 --> 03:22:32,473
HENRY KISSINGER SAYS IT'S

4699
03:22:32,473 --> 03:22:35,109
POSSIBLE.

4700
03:22:35,109 --> 03:22:35,943
THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER SAYS

4701
03:22:35,943 --> 03:22:38,045
IT IS HAPPENING.

4702
03:22:38,045 --> 03:22:38,846
IN THE UKRAINE, RUSSIAN TROOPS

4703
03:22:38,846 --> 03:22:41,349
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITH AN ARMY

4704
03:22:41,349 --> 03:22:43,751
OF PRO-RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS SINCE

4705
03:22:43,751 --> 03:22:45,987
2014.

4706
03:22:45,987 --> 03:22:46,821
U.S. CONGRESS VOTED TO SUPPLY

4707
03:22:46,821 --> 03:22:49,523
MORE WEAPONS TO THE UKRAINE

4708
03:22:49,523 --> 03:22:50,291
ARMY, BUT A CEASE-FIRE IS IN

4709
03:22:50,291 --> 03:22:52,793
PLACE.

4710
03:22:52,793 --> 03:22:53,694
IN SYRIA, RUSSIA'S AIR CAMPAIGN

4711
03:22:53,694 --> 03:22:54,628
HAS BEEN CONDUCTED IN CLOSE

4712
03:22:54,628 --> 03:22:59,800
PROXIMITY TO WHERE U.S. AIRCRAFT

4713
03:22:59,800 --> 03:23:01,535
IS DOING ITS OWN BOMBING AGAINST

4714
03:23:01,535 --> 03:23:08,742
THE ISLAMIC STATE.

4715
03:23:08,742 --> 03:23:09,477
THEY ARE HOPING TO DEFEND

4716
03:23:09,477 --> 03:23:10,211
THEMSELVES AGAINST RUSSIAN

4717
03:23:10,211 --> 03:23:10,644
AIRSTRIKES.

4718
03:23:10,644 --> 03:23:12,847
THAT WOULD'VE PUT U.S. AND

4719
03:23:12,847 --> 03:23:13,848
POSITION TO KILL RUSSIAN

4720
03:23:13,848 --> 03:23:15,916
SOLDIERS JUST AS AMERICAN ARMS

4721
03:23:15,916 --> 03:23:18,886
DID IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE 1980'S

4722
03:23:18,886 --> 03:23:19,620
AND SOVIET ARMS KILLED U.S.

4723
03:23:19,620 --> 03:23:22,823
TROOPS IN VIETNAM.

4724
03:23:22,823 --> 03:23:25,993
THE COLD WAR BEGAN IN 1947 WHEN

4725
03:23:25,993 --> 03:23:26,761
U.S. PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN

4726
03:23:26,761 --> 03:23:27,795
ASKED CONGRESS TO HELP STOP THE

4727
03:23:27,795 --> 03:23:28,596
SOVIET UNION FROM PROJECTING ITS

4728
03:23:28,596 --> 03:23:30,831
POWER.

4729
03:23:30,831 --> 03:23:33,234
SOVIET DIPLOMATS SAW THIS POLICY

4730
03:23:33,234 --> 03:23:34,001
AS IMPERIAL AGGRESSION FROM AN

4731
03:23:34,001 --> 03:23:34,902
AMERICAN ELITE, CLAIMING THE

4732
03:23:34,902 --> 03:23:37,939
 RIGHT TO LEAD THE WORLD.

4733
03:23:37,939 --> 03:23:39,373
IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1969 THAT THE

4734
03:23:39,373 --> 03:23:43,344
TWO SIDES SAW A KIND OF TRUCE

4735
03:23:43,344 --> 03:23:48,015
TO REDUCE THE WAR.

4736
03:23:48,015 --> 03:23:49,483
SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE COLD WAR

4737
03:23:49,483 --> 03:23:51,285
CANNOT REPEAT BECAUSE RUSSIA HAS

4738
03:23:51,285 --> 03:23:52,019
NO IDEOLOGY AS ALLURING AS

4739
03:23:52,019 --> 03:23:52,420
COMMUNISM.

4740
03:23:52,420 --> 03:23:56,591
THE COUNTERARGUMENT IS THAT

4741
03:23:56,591 --> 03:23:57,458
WHILE TODAY MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT

4742
03:23:57,458 --> 03:23:58,225
COLD WAR, IT SHOULD BE TREATED

4743
03:23:58,225 --> 03:24:00,328
SIMILARLY.

4744
03:24:00,328 --> 03:24:01,195
THAT IS BECAUSE RUSSIA CONTAINS

4745
03:24:01,195 --> 03:24:02,897
A VAST NUCLEAR ARSENAL AS WELL

4746
03:24:02,897 --> 03:24:04,799
AS THE WELL AND NUCLEAR MEANS TO

4747
03:24:04,799 --> 03:24:06,000
BE A SUPERPOWER.

FLAT AMERICANS RUPTUR --

4749
03:24:09,870 --> 03:24:13,774
VLADIMIR'S  RUSSIA MAY

4750
03:24:13,774 --> 03:24:18,179
NOT HAVE THE POWER, BUT A COLD

4751
03:24:18,179 --> 03:24:23,184
WAR ORACLE ONE COULD BE -- OR A

4752
03:24:23,184 --> 03:24:23,984
COOL ONE COULD BE COSTLY TO BOTH

TO MY MIND, THE SCENIC BYWAYS

4807
03:28:23,357 --> 03:28:24,258
ALONG CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAY ONE

4808
03:28:24,258 --> 03:28:26,460
IS AN UNPARALLELED WORLD-CLASS

4809
03:28:26,460 --> 03:28:31,732
DRIVING DESTINATION FOR EASE OF

03:28:31,732 --> 03:28:35,902

 COMFORTABLE VIEWS, THE ROAD

4812
03:28:36,704 --> 03:28:38,572
FROM BIG SUR TO SANTA BARBARA,

4813
03:28:38,572 --> 03:28:41,575
CALIFORNIA JUST CAN'T BE BEAT.

4814
03:28:41,575 --> 03:28:44,445
NATURALLY THE CAR YOU PICK TO

4815
03:28:44,445 --> 03:28:45,613
BIG SUR SHOULD BE AS EPIC AS THE

4816
03:28:45,613 --> 03:28:47,781
ROUTE.

4817
03:28:47,781 --> 03:28:49,483
I SUGGEST THE 2017 ROLLS-ROYCE

DAWN, THE CONVERTIBLE THAT

4819
03:28:54,121 --> 03:28:54,955
WILL START HITTING THE STREETS

4820
03:28:54,955 --> 03:28:55,389
IN THE FALL.

4821
03:28:55,389 --> 03:28:56,590
DAWN REFERS TO THE ORIGINAL

4822
03:28:56,590 --> 03:29:00,661
SILVER SAWN THAT ROLLS-ROYCE

4823
03:29:00,661 --> 03:29:01,395
MADE IN THE 1950'S.

4824
03:29:01,395 --> 03:29:02,596
ONLY 28 WERE MADE.

4825
03:29:02,596 --> 03:29:06,700
THIS NEW DAWN IS A $350,000

4826
03:29:06,700 --> 03:29:09,369
CRUISER JAMPACKED WITH LUXURIES

4827
03:29:09,369 --> 03:29:14,941

YOU ARE BASICALLY ON A CLOUD.

4832

THE STEERING IS REALLY NICE.

4833
03:29:24,919 --> 03:29:28,088
IT IS SO EASY TO STEER.

4834
03:29:28,088 --> 03:29:28,889
THE STEERING WHEEL IS REALLY

4835
03:29:28,889 --> 03:29:29,623
THIN, KIND OF LIKE A YACHT.

4836
03:29:29,623 --> 03:29:35,229
>> ROLLS-ROYCE HAS USED YACHT

4837
03:29:35,229 --> 03:29:36,063
MAKING TECHNIQUES BY THIRD AND

4838

THE BRUSHWOOD INTERIOR.

4842
03:29:39,033 --> 03:29:39,733

AROUND THE CORNERS AND IT LOOKS

4877
03:30:58,145 --> 03:31:00,748
A LITTLE FLATTENED OVERALL.

4878
03:31:00,748 --> 03:31:01,548
THE LED HEADLIGHTS AND NEWLY

THE EIGHT SPEED AUTOMATIC
