a rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've made for myself over the</font>

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,649
past few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found myself coming up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">religion kind of changes moves to</font>

43
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
agnosticism and moves to atheism and

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,299
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not this one concrete thing</font>

49
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,960
of a confusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stressful experience</font>

50
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,030
so how does someone who can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

51
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,950
up her mind about<font color="#E5E5E5"> religion celebrate</font>

excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it without being swallowed</font>

54
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,470
up by<font color="#E5E5E5"> this huge commercial enterprise</font>

55
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,420
for me I put the month in a little box

56
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,369
the month december is a month that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

57
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,720
allowed to get excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

58
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,430
holiday but i will see so many members

59
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my family when I will see so many of</font>

60
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">my friends this year there are two songs</font>

61
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,170
that goes beyond my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas playlist</font>

62
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,000
one is Ellie Goulding's cover of your

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,490
song by elton john<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw you in UK might</font>

64
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,960
recognize this song has the one on the

65
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,909
current John Doe is Christmas advert for

66
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,439
me the song first came to attention as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

67
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,090
big fan of Ellie Goulding she's probably

68
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,649
one of my favorite singers she has a

69
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,509
really unique voice is very stripped

70
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,329
back is piano<font color="#E5E5E5"> the music video everything</font>

71
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I love about the British winter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

72
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">am NOT a British winter person I've much</font>

73
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,330
provoked sunshine the second song is Tim

74
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,099
mentions white wine in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sun now this</font>

75
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,629
was released last year it's by the

76
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">atheist</font>

77
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,360
australian comedian to mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

78
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,370
probably my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> comedian this</font>

79
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,010
gorgeous<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven-minute completely</font>

80
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,340
sentimental lovely family heartbreaking

81
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,980
funny brilliant song about Christmas

82
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,720
time but me the song is basically

83
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,490
everything I think of when I think of

84
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,200
Christmas so that's kind of remarkable

85
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,790
considering that Tim Minchin is an

86
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,710
atheist an atheist who doesn't shy away

87
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,630
from being critical about religion he

88
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,040
doesn't shy away from being funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

89
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,350
religion either I have a lot of respect

90
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,430
for him for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's not just being</font>

91
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,750
provocative for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sake of it he's</font>

92
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,100
actually making very good points and

93
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,780
he's being funny and his work is

94
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,340
generally a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high quality recently</font>

95
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,140
wrote the music for the RSC version of

96
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matilda the musical which I really want</font>

97
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go and see but it doesn't look like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

98
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,250
great to be able to see so if you're

99
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be around stratford-upon-avon</font>

102
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,520
a lot last you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I loved it a lot last</font>

103
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,350
year has even more of an impact for me

104
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,820
now being thousands of miles away from

105
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,770
home the song is kind of ultimately

106
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,990
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas tires a time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and family</font>

111
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,600
my bedroom the lighting is strange

112
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,430
Princess Leia and I both wish you a very

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,500
happy first of December a pinch and a

114
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,730
punch for the first of the month no

115
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,530
turns of any kind there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a very</font>

116
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,630
peculiar surge recently of kind of nasty

117
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,790
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> inclined comments and messages and</font>

118
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,290
one of them told me I looked a lot

119
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,090
better with my hair down and without

120
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,700
lipstick on so am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will the lipstick</font>

121
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,260
and the hair just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you I don't know</font>

122
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,640
why anyone feels that they have the

123
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,930
right to comment on anyone elses

124
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,760
appearance especially a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> blogger</font>

125
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
this might sound hypocritical coming

126
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,820
from someone who has pictures of all

127
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,530
these gorgeous women on my wall but

128
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly at least insult me with</font>
