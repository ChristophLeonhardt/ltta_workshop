two actresses have accused former President George HW Bush of groping them and following that type of sexual assault with an incredibly corny joke that they did not find funny but rather offensive now this story first broke yesterday when an actress by the name of Heather Lind shared her story on an Instagram post which has since been deleted she had written in the post that he meaning George HW Bush touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side he told me a dirty joke and then all the while being photographed touched me again she also continued so this story made headlines yesterday and part of the reason why I didn't cover it was because there was a lot that was unclear to me at the time right so for instance he has been wheelchair-bound for the last five years and sometimes you accidentally you know touch someone in a way that you didn't mean to touch them I didn't know if that's what happened I didn't know if it was intentional as soon as a story broke you know a spokesperson for Bush released a statement apologizing for the joke and then I'm like oh that seems like a bit of an admission but still things are a little unclear but now recent reporting indicates that things are pretty clear a second actress has come out and provided some evidence of him doing something incredibly similar so first let's take a photo a look at Heather Lin's photo this is what she posted on Instagram and this doesn't show any evidence but it shows the picture in question he allegedly grabbed her behind while this photo was being taken okay and debts been reported on this and said more than a year ago a tipster passed word about the Heather Lind incident to Deadspin we were told that Bush had during a photo op groped her and told her that his favorite magician was David coppaFeel while fondling her really this is that written do you think that's acceptable like that is Wow no no of course it's not acceptable look you can't do it and that's why these stories are important now the only reason why I this is it's all a matter of degree right and first of all none of the degrees are acceptable it's never acceptable to grab a woman's ass without asking earth that's obvious right most obvious thing in the world but to some in the older generation unfortunately it's not obvious so you know that because he's making a joke about it he in front of everybody he's like ha ha David Copperfield cuz I am grabbing your ass even though I'm a former president okay so he's from a different time doesn't matter he makes the joke and it's out in the open and allegedly Barbara Bush just kind of rolled her eyes at it and you know just kind of made light of it and so following Heather Lynn's account of what occurred there's another actress by the name of Jordana grown girl Nick who says that she experienced something very similar in fact she wrote I got sent the heather Lynn story by many people this morning and I'm afraid that mine is entirely similar in August of 2016 Grohl Nick was working at a main production of Hunchback of Notre Dom the former president caught apricot a performance he came backstage during an intermission she says and she had the rest of the cast gathered for a photo so here's the setup here's how it all starts then she says we all circled around him and Barbara for a photo and I was right next to him he reached his right hand around my behind and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group do you want to know who my favorite magician is as I felt his hand dig into my flesh he said David Copperfield and then she also provided a photo you know where you can see his hand touching her behind okay so the reason why this is not Weinstein level or O'Reilly or ales level is one he doesn't hold power over them although he's a former president I grant you that he it's also about intent like those guys almost same exact pattern they would isolate the women in a room they'd be in the room with them they would ask for sex and then they would touch them in all sorts of different ways there's all these different things that they did this is a guy who clearly does not know that what he's doing is wrong that's why he's making a joke in front of everyone including his wife about David Copperfield now it doesn't mitigate that he's doing it and the reason I like these stories coming out is so that even ninety three-year-olds understand you can't just grab people's ass anymore and apparently they maybe back in the day they thought that that was perfectly acceptable it is not acceptable okay but in his own mind and you could disagree with me and say I don't care what his mind is but he did not have malicious intent otherwise he wouldn't have broadcast it to everybody right and so and look someone to older folks and look you could argue Ailes and Weinstein and O'Reilly were all so old but 93 is a different level of old he served in World War two etcetera it's not yet not an excuse I'm just saying so the older folks sometimes will use words that are outdated like colored people they don't mean I don't like black people they just they don't know that people don't use that word anymore so you see what I'm saying so I love that the stories coming out because at least the more education so people stop doing it but it just doesn't feel as evil as the other guys so look I get what you're saying you know he grew up in a different time where it was totally okay to grow people women namely and you know feel this entitlement in regard to putting your hands on someone else without consent but we like we're all he's living like he knows he knows I don't care what his intent was his intent was to grab a woman's ass without asking permission ahead of time right he it has been around he knows how much society has changed so I'll give you an example when I was in Middle School in high school the F word and I'm not referring to fuck was thrown around left and right and no one no one even cared it wasn't offensive it wasn't considered derogatory in any way and guess what society has changed its progressed and that word is unacceptable and I never used that word I know that using that word is wrong I would never use that word and then use the excuse of when I was growing up that word was totally acceptable no Society changes and he's a president former president okay he knows better he is not entitled to grabbing anyone's ass I don't care if he was born ninety three years ago or if he was born a hundred years ago where five hundred years ago doesn't matter if he's alive today he knows that society's changed that's my point which is that he might not know that so you know when people say colored people they don't know they're not trying to rub your face in it Isis I think I heard no they're not the other day but a while back someone even actually still used Chinamen and now some folks that use that they know what they're doing in there total jerks right and some folks are just like I stuck in 1950 and and remember this is the George HW Bush who got in a lot of political trouble because he didn't know to what what a scanner at a grocery store was he's like whoa what is that how does it tell you the price he didn't know the price of milk I mean he was known for being clueless and he's a smart guy way smarter than his son but yeah yeah he's very low bar right okay so I but I'm for the 18th time in the story I'm not excusing his behavior what I like that the story is coming out not as a ha ha to the George HW Bush but as a way of educating folks if you lived in the old school and you thought that was acceptable it is not acceptable that is sexual assault and and people are justifiably very mad about that now whether you think it matters what his intent is or not that's a find it I think I hope that's a fine disagreement I mean it's just one other point that I want to make okay you're taking this photo with these actresses while your wife is there like even if we lived in this crazy society which you know pretty recently we did live in this society where it was okay to just grope women like that right yeah what happened to family values your with your wife and you are grabbing another woman's ass right in front of her unacceptable unacceptable on every level so no I I just I can't I can't get over it I can't get over like the excuses I can't get over the the apology / non-apology they released let's just quickly read that for you this is from a spokesperson for bush at age 93 president bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes picture okay let's pause there it's for me to agree with Ana the Texan terrible excuse yeah but it gets worse to try to try to put people at ease the president routinely tells the same joke and on occasion he has padded women's rears in what he intended to be a good natured manner what no that is not a good-natured thing okay you don't touch a person's ass thinking that it's completely okay and you're entitled to it some some have seen it as innocent others clearly view it as inappropriate to anyone he has offended President Bush apologizes most sincerely Wow you're right that's a terrible now that ivory that's a terrible apology I good-naturedly sexually assaulted you and if you are offended well I mean Jesus I can't guess we apologize you understand that it was good-natured you know those are the good people but if you were offended we sincerely apologize all right but in a super last thing let me ask you did you feel any differently if George HW Bush does it in this manner or Trump does it and the reason I asked that well by the way you could be Trump or Clinton right to me it feels like Trump and Clinton know exactly what they're doing and it feels way worse and I'm but I could be wrong that's why I'm asking you as opposed to HW Bush here's the thing regardless of who it is if someone puts their hands on me in any way that I don't want or like or didn't consent to I'm gonna have the same reaction emotion and feeling toward it right and so I get what you're coming from right Trump has a certain level of sleaziness to him that might make me feel a little worse about it but no I think at the end of the day when you're violated in that way you're violated remember I shared the story of the guy who grabbed my ass at a YouTube event and I liked that guy I was a fan of his and and it was it was such a degrading feeling and I just kind of brushed it off and put it in the back of my mind cuz I didn't want to think about it again and so it doesn't matter you know if you agree with the person's ideology or if you like the person or hate the person it just feels you feel violated I hear you and so you're the better authority on this I have also had my ass grabbed but not in the same way obviously and mine was in the middle of an assault but I will tell that story in the post I'll tell the story in the postgame TYT Network comm /join okay interesting but I will defer to your judgment as and and I hear you that that Bush certainly and by the way I agreed with this from the beginning but he doesn't get a pass Yeah right it just feels a little different for me than someone who's maliciously doing in but yeah you're the better judge help us build independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
