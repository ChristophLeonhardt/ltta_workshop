once a month around the time we start feeling a little bloated and cramped we like to visit our favorite website everyday feminism to remind ourselves that for some people it's that time of the month every single day but don't get me wrong the writers at everyday feminism are not shrill and insufferable Virat's goes who try to make women miserable the toxic philosophy ever all goes to try to make everyone miserable with toxic philosophy for instance this month on the site there's a post that points out all the ways that well-meaning white teachers bring racism into our schools so if you're a white teacher who risks her life going into a crime-ridden minority neighborhood and the desperate hope you might give some child a chance at a better life you'll definitely want to read this article to find out how everyday feminism thinks you're doing it wrong or else you might just want to grab your crotch with one hand and stick out your middle finger with the other and make grunting noises while thrusting out your hips you choose but just in case you are interested here's how everyday feminism thinks you white teachers might be injecting racism into our schools one you lower or raise achievement expectations based on race or ethnicity if you assume that say Asian students are going to be good at math while black students are going to be good at shaking down asian students at gun point you may be missing out on an opportunity to allow your Asian students to excel in other areas like doing laundry and cooking dumplings instead you should try accepting each individual student as he comes at you though if it's a black student coming at you you might go to protect itself by holding an asian student in front of you too you use racially coded language try not try not to say things to your students like a t-bone you so ghetto or healing ma You certainly have a tiger mom instead say race-neutral things like hey t-bone good look down put down that gun and listen wing mobs your mother calls me at home again i'm going to send t-bone 200 out 3 you mispronounced your students names according to the article this is a subtle and powerful way that white teachers inject racism into our schools let's say you have a student named leticia haram baba camogie alum bay if you refer to that student as teesh or hey you or please stop stealing the money out of the petty cash box in my desk you may give the impression that you're so busy trying to save the child from spinning into generational poverty that you haven't got time to kowtow to her parents fashionable and self-destructive child naming whims instead you might try sitting at home all morning sorry knocking back a whiskeys and muttering screw them let the little buggers beach themselves so I think we can all agree that once again everyday feminism is making the world a better place for angry disaffected neurotic social justice warriors who are in turn making the world a worse place for the rest of us trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show so we know the thing is if it easy I begged them to let me prove record ahead of opening but they wouldn't do it meanwhile things

to wwh goal.com / Andrew that is ww Burt goal.com / Andrew boy oh boy did things explode yesterday I have to say this you know this show is a little different than other shoulder because everybody else most shows you come on in here somebody you know giving you a definite opinion I'm an artist I've lived most of my life as a novelist and where I'm always doing is just observing things and trying to figure out what it is I'm looking at and when you do that you understand that some of your personal prejudices get in the way so this week began remember with Meryl Streep making that stupid speech and Trump snapped back at her and said oh she's an overrated actress on Twitter you know he said she's an overrated actress and and I was thinking like why why is he even giving through the time of day you know all Hollywood actresses one is for people to pay attention to them why does Trump snap back at them and now he has done it with the press with the news media obviously yesterday CNN published this story saying there was an addendum when the intelligence agencies were briefing Obama and Trump there was an addendum saying that the Russians might have some stuff on Trump including stuff about what he was doing with Russian prostitutes all of it unconfirmed all of it the press already had it and weren't running it because they couldn't get any confirmation on it and finally and then BuzzFeed put the documents the two documents out there so yesterday Trump went off at his press columnist Trump went off on these guys and Jim Acosta from CNN tried to get dance ask them a question and here is the exchange that now has the news media going up in smoke information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public as far as BuzzFeed which is a failing pile of garbage writing it I think they're going to suffer the consequences they already are and as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up and by the way we just felt that I was coming down Michael Cohn I was being come Michael Cohn as a very talented lawyer is a good lawyer in my firm it was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohn they were talking about so all night long it's michael cohn I said I want to see your passport he brings his passport to my office I say hey wait a minute he didn't leave the country he wasn't out of the country that Michael Kohn of the Trump Organization wasn't fraud it turned out to be a different michael cohn it's a disgrace what took place it's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael John sir since you're attacking can you give us a question sure no Lex go ahead present you our attend our nightly news nation not yet you give us a junior organization you are tracking our news organization can you give us a chance at the question sir go ahead sir quietly quiet mr. president let go ahead you say can I get a question no perfect like can you give us a CO to be writing us can you give us a question be really honest I'm you not going to give you a hard to our faces okay smushes Acosta and CNN just crushes of them right and of course now the press is fluttering around because because even as I said yesterday even the New York Times which is only a former newspaper wouldn't run with this story because they knew it was nothing you know it was they didn't have any confirmation now there you can be suspicious about trump he's been awfully nice to Putin he says awfully nice things to Putin it's perfectly fine to say he's being too soft on Russia it's perfectly fine to say he's being sucked in by Putin or whatever you want to say but until you got the goods you don't go after the president-elect by sending this stuff out now of course there was a difference between what CNN did which was report a true story that this was in the briefing and what BuzzFeed did which was put out this garbage so now the press itself has started to fight with each other because Sean Spicer but before that exchange Sean Spicer got up and linked the two of them together just condemned them both as frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog there was openly hostile to the president elects campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office according to BuzzFeed own editor there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report the executive editor of the New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was quote totally unsubstantiated echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet the fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks okay so now CNN is invested in separating and stuff from BuzzFeed because what buzz we did was not journalism you don't put up this document that has a salacious attacks on somebody that you have no backing for no confirmation of now just remember this before we go into this deeper remember that during the primaries each and every Republican candidate destroyed himself in his reaction to trump trump didn't destroy them Trump never did anything on stage maybe with Bush maybe Jeb Bush by just making him look like a weakling you know making him look but it was really Bush who played into that who kept looking like what what Trump said he was Marco Rubio destroyed himself by trying to play Trump by fighting back the same way that Trump was fighting with his bullying techniques or the insults remember his small hands and we all know what that means in all this and Cruz an incredibly smart man a very probably the smartest guy on the stage he destroyed himself by being too smart by strategizing I'm going to I'm going to ride Trump for a wise going to be my good friend Donald and then at the last minute I'm going to break apart and all this stuff Snickers office they all destroyed themselves in the way they reacted to something they hadn't seen before and that is what is happening today to the news media here is first let's look at Anderson Cooper with Kellyanne trying to separate himself separate his network CNN from BuzzFeed do you acknowledge here and now that CNN did not release the 35-page unsubstantiated claims against Donald Trump and it was misleading and untrue for Sean Spicer to suggest otherwise no our incoming press secretary Sean Spicer was exactly right as was the president-elect Anderson CNN went first yesterday and BuzzFeed one second we didn't reveal any bugs be reported I didn't say that you did but you linked from Spartanburg ritory let me should tell you Anderson let's back up I know CNN must be feeling the heat today of having a headline yesterday at around 630pm that said quote Intel Chiefs presented Trump with information that rough could compromise Russia had information to compromise him that is just false and as you saw through NBC News reports today tweets from people at Politico no friend of Donald Trump and a lot of frankly a lot of outlets print and electronic outlets so reluctant and hesitant to go forward with anything close to a CNN or BuzzFeed did well there could be wedding but he went first yes yeah you went first and they linked to the BuzzFeed thing you know they linked to the BuzzFeed thing they've got no excuse i mean look Jim Acosta what Jim Acosta was doing is typical you know press conference up if anybody did it to Obama however we know what happened then we remember when make major Garrett asked after the Iran deal asked Obama if if he was satisfied that there were four ha siren was still holding four hostages while he was celebrating the Iran deal and Obama slapped him down you know I'm not satisfied and you know it that's a that's nonsense and you know it and the press went not to help was that disrespectful was that disrespectful to Obama then you know the the famous one was Dana Bash who said it went over the line into disrespect but there was a show on the PBS channel in Boston called beat depressed listen to this discussion after major Garrett asked that question question was just performance art it was about major Garrett it wasn't about President Obama it wasn't about the issue and and just to say that why are you you know your content to attend with them it all and these questions are prepared I mean oh no he studied down yeah it was it was just awful completely inappropriate it was exactly the case you know it ties back to the last subject we were discussing there is particularly in the Obama administration a very an undercurrent in the American political discussion that believes that that Obama is out to sell the country is a secret muslim whatever it may be and the discussion of this around deal has has had that tinge to it so I think in that context coming out and saying like you're here celebrating la mayor well you know proud proud patriotic Americans are you know suffering and Iranian prisons that I think added an extra edge of awfulness to the question so you know I don't but by the way I don't believe that Acosta and oh i should add by the way their cost of defended major Garrett at the time across that came out and said the question was completely appropriate a lot of people are talking about it so it cost of stood up for his fellow reporter and didn't but why were they even discussing it who cares if you're disrespectful of the president I don't think will cost the O's trumpet apology the question is is Trump doing anything wrong because now is going to be like Paul this is terrible you know that President of the United States it's chilling it's chilling to free speech we're going to hear all that stuff we're already hearing it in the new york times as i said a former newspaper I got to stop here to say goodbye to our friends on Facebook and YouTube but Facebook is been giving us a little trouble over there so what you want to do is come over to the daily wire calm subscribe you can watch the whole thing from beginning to end and you don't have to worry about liberal sensors
