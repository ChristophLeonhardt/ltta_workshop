my favorite search leave role is called the master role or the Italian role usually both through the way they roll their short search leads up they'll roll the cuff and just keep rolling you're rolling the problem with that is that the cup roll gets really thick so it gets really tight I just don't think it looks that great the master roll is nice gives you a nice clean cuff and it doesn't really punch up what you do instead of rolling the cuff up you actually unbutton with your cuff and you bring the cup up just below your elbow and then after that you take that fold and then you roll it up above the cuff and it what's nice about that it's nice and clean it's not thick it's not going to cost circulation to your arms and it just looks really great you
