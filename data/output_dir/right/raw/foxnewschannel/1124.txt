IMMUNITY FOR HIMSELF.

13
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,244
ANDREW MCCABE WANTS A PROTECTION

ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH.

35
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,646

00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:04,421
INFORMATION WAS A GAME-CHANGER.

41
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:05,822
IN ADDITION TO OTHER

42
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,390
INTELLIGENCE, AND APPLIED LYNCH

43
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,625
WOULD NOT LET THE EMAIL

44
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,626
INVESTIGATION GO TOO FAR.

45
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:11,194
THAT INTELLIGENCE IS NOT PUBLIC

46
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,496
AND ITS LIABILITY AND CLEAR.

47
00:01:13,496 --> 00:01:15,532
ON, FORMER DIRECTOR CHOSE HIS

48
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:18,401
WORDS CAREFULLY ABOUT LYNCH.

49
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:20,403
>> I THINK WE ARE BOTH TELLING

50
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:20,770
THE TRUTH.

51
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,805
I NEVER WENT TO HER AND SEND

52
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,406
LORETTA COME I THINK YOU SHOULD

53
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:24,608
RECUSE YOURSELF.

54
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:26,409
THE PROBLEM WAS SHE ALREADY

55
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:27,077
ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY THAT SHE

56
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,412
WOULDN'T AND THEN SHE WOULD

57
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:30,046
ACCEPT MY RECOMMENDATION.

58
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,215
AT THAT POINT, WHAT DO I DO?

59
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:35,819
I DECIDED I HAVE TO STEP AWAY.

60
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,787
>> FOX NEWS CONFIRMS FORMER FBI

61
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:39,222
DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE

62
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:41,191
WHO WORKED DIRECTLY UNDER COMEY

63
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,826
WANTS A SPECIAL STATUS IF HE

64
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:44,227
TESTIFIES ON CAPITOL HILL.

65
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:46,196
IT'S CALLED USE IMMUNITY AND IT

66
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,330
MEANS THE CASE TESTIMONY CANNOT

67
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,865
BE USED AGAINST HIM IN A

68
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:50,200
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

69
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,501
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT

70
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,669
McCABE LIED UNDER OATH AND

71
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:55,505
MADE A CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO THE

72
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:57,707
U.S. ATTORNEY HERE IN D.C. FOR

73
00:01:57,707 --> 00:02:00,043
LYING TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS.

00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:03,847
AGAINST A DEAL TO SECURE

77
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,849
McCABE'S TESTIMONY.

78
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,684
>> WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM

79
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:13,623
OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FBI

80
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:15,659
DURING THE COMEY YEARS WHERE

81
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,193
APPARENTLY THERE WAS MISCONDUCT

82
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:19,162
GOING ON WHICH I THINK IS REALLY

83
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:20,930
IMPUGNED THE REPUTATION OF THE

84
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,098
FINEST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN

85
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,800
THE WORLD.

86
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,673
AND WE NEED TO CLEAR THE AIR.

87
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,441
IMMUNITY WOULD BE A MISTAKE.

88
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:33,410
>> MCCABE'S LAWYER SAID

89
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,210
"McCABE IS WILLING TO TESTIFY

90
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,911
BUT BECAUSE OF THE CRIMINAL

91
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:38,448
REFERRAL HE MUST BE AFFORDED

92
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:39,082
SUITABLE LEGAL PROTECTION,

93
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:40,417
ADDING IF YOU WERE UNABLE TO GET

94
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:43,019
SUCH DEAL, MUGABE COULD HAVE NO

95
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,021
CHOICE BUT TO INVOKE HIS FIFTH
