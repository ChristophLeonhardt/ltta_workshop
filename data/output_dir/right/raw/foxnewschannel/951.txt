1
00:00:00,655 --> 00:00:02,023
SOME OF THOSE HE HAS RESPONDED

2
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:03,457
TO DIRECTLY, OTHERS HE HAS NOT.

3
00:00:03,457 --> 00:00:06,294

00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:08,229
REPORTING.

6
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:09,931
AS WE TOLD WITH THE TOP OF THE

7
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:10,631
PROGRAM PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

8
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:11,632
THERE IS NO LONGER A NUCLEAR

9
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:13,868
THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA.

10
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:16,271
HE'S ALSO DEFENDING HIS DECISION

11
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:18,439
TO HALT U.S. MILITARY EXERCISES

12
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,074
WITH SOUTH KOREA DURING

13
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:20,809
NEGOTIATIONS WITH KIM JONG UN'S

14
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,110
GOVERNMENT.

15
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,311
ALL OF IT IS CREATING AS YOU CAN

16
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,447
IMAGINE QUITE A STIR ON

17
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:26,314
CAPITOL HILL.

18
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,682
CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CORKE HAS

19
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:28,750
TONIGHT'S REPORT FROM THE

20
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,484
WHITE HOUSE.

21
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:31,519
>> AFTER MORE THAN 45 HOURS ON

22
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,189
THE GROUND AND ANOTHER 22 IN THE

23
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,325
AIR, PRESIDENT TRUMP RETURNED

24
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:36,992
FROM HIS HISTORIC SINGAPORE

25
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:39,762
SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN AMID

26
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:40,863
STRONG HEADWINDS OF SKEPTICISM

27
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:41,864
THAT THE SUMMIT PRODUCED PLENTY

28
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:43,065
OF DECLARATIONS BY THE

29
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:45,935
WHITE HOUSE BUT FAR FEW DETAILS.

30
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:46,702
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP THE

31
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,305
PRESIDENT FROM UNLEASHING A

32
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:49,905
TWEET STORM OF OPTIMISM

33
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,607
DECLARING THE WORLD HAS TAKEN A

34
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:53,242
BIG STEP BACK FROM POTENTIAL

35
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:53,909
NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE.

36
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,112
IF THERE IS NO LONGER A NUCLEAR

37
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:57,913
THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA BEFORE

38
00:00:57,913 --> 00:00:59,482
ADDING NORTH KOREA WAS OUR

39
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:00,716
BIGGEST AND MOST DANGEROUS

40
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:01,684
PROBLEM.

41
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:02,718
NO LONGER.

42
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:03,252
SLEEP WELL TONIGHT.

43
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,654
THE PRESIDENT HAS COME UNDER

44
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:06,288
CRITICISM IN SOME CORNERS

45
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:08,791
BECAUSE OF THE ONE AND A HALF

46
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,694
PAGE STATEMENT THAT HE SIGNED IN

47
00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:12,528
SINGAPORE, SPELLED OUT NO

48
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:13,896
SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS FROM THE

49
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:16,031
NORTH ASIDE FROM WORKING TOWARD

50
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,633
THE COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF

51
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,135
THE KOREAN PENINSULA, A PROMISE

52
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:19,869
THAT THE REGIME HAS REPEATEDLY

53
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:23,305
MADE AND BROKEN SINCE THE

54
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:24,073
1990s.

55
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:25,274
ON CAPITOL HILL, A FURIOUS

56
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:26,676
DEBATE OVER WHETHER OR NOT THE

57
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:27,543
PRESIDENT GAVE AWAY FAR MORE

58
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:29,679
THAN HE EXTRACTED FROM THE

59
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:30,980
MEETING RAGED ON TODAY WITH

60
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,249
MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

61
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:34,484
POLITICAL SPECTRUM EXPRESSING

62
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:35,652
SKEPTICISM.

63
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:38,221
>> THE SUMMIT WAS MUCH MORE SHOW

64
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:38,688
THAN SUBSTANCE.

65
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:40,156
WHAT THE TEXANS CALL ALL CATTLE,

66
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:42,659
NO HAT.

67
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:43,727
AFTER ALL THE POMP AND

68
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:45,695
CIRCUMSTANCE HAVE FADED, IT

69
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:47,564
SEEMS CLEAR THAT KAREN AND JIM

70
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:49,099
WALKED AWAY THE VICTOR

71
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,100
UNFORTUNATELY.

72
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,301
>> THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT MADE

73
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:52,569
PROMISES BEFORE AND IT'S BROKEN.

74
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,004
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT

75
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,238
PROMISES REGARDING MINOR ITEMS,

76
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,439
THESE ARE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND

77
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,541
BALLISTIC MISSILES THAT HAVE THE

78
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,309
CAPABILITY OF REACHING THE

79
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:00,310
UNITED STATES.

80
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,311
>> THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE

81
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:02,279
APPLAUDED FOR DISRUPTING THE

82
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:02,679
STATUS QUO.

83
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,081
NOW LET'S GO GET AN AGREEMENT.

84
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,549
WE SHOULD BE UNDER NO DELUSION

85
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,885
THIS IS GOING TO BE FAST.

86
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,887
>> MIKE POMPEO SAYS HE EXPECTS

87
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:12,089
NORTH KOREA TO TAKE MAJOR STEPS

88
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,991
TOWARDS NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT

89
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,092
DURING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST

90
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:15,859
TERM, TELLING REPORTERS IN SEOUL

91
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:18,395
WE ARE HOPEFUL WE CAN ACHIEVE

92
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,664
THAT IN THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF

93
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:21,732
YEARS BEFORE ADDING THERE'S A

94
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:24,068
LOT OF WORK LEFT TO DO.

95
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:25,402
ASKED WHY THE WORDS VERIFIABLE

96
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,437
AND IRREVERSIBLE WERE NOT IN A

97
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,204
DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE TWO

98
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:30,074
LEADERS IN SINGAPORE, MIKE

99
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:32,042
POMPEO SAID TODAY BECAUSE THE

100
00:02:32,042 --> 00:00:00,000
WORDS COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION
