1
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:01,442
BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

2
00:00:01,442 --> 00:00:03,043
>> Shannon: STICK AROUND.

3
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:04,611
MORE RESULTS ARE COMING AND WE

4
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:05,579
APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS.

5
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:07,080
>> THE MACHINE WILL BE HERE.

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,915
>> Shannon: WITH ALL THAT IN

7
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:10,617
MIND, LET'S BRING A MATT GORMAN,

8
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:11,819
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE

9
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,220
NATIONAL CONGRESSIONAL

10
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,587
COMMITTEE.

11
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:17,858
>> GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

12
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:18,659
I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT

13
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:19,726
IS AND WHAT DEMOCRATS THOUGHT IT

14
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:22,429
WOULD BE.

15
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,797
DEMOCRATS DIDN'T JUST BREAK THE

16
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:25,199
GLASS, THEY THREW BACK A FLAMING

17
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,600
CATCHER OUT THE WINDOW.

18
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,069
THEY SPENT $7 MILLION JUST TO

19
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:29,903
GET A SINGLE DEMOCRAT THROUGH TO

20
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,405
THE GENERAL ELECTION, AND

21
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:32,806
TONIGHT, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE

22
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:33,540
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

23
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,575
>> Shannon: OKAY.

24
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:35,642
LET'S TALK FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

25
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:37,411
RACE IN CALIFORNIA, WE SPENT A

26
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,512
LOT OF TIME ON THAT, AND HOW

27
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:40,914
CRITICAL IT IS IN THE FALL TO

28
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:42,149
GETTING G.O.P. VOTERS TO SHOW UP

29
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:42,883
IN THE POLLS FOR SOME OF THESE

30
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:45,819
OF THE RACES, I READ THE

31
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:47,654
ANALYSIS FROM THE "L.A. TIMES,,"

32
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:51,191
ANY PAPER YOU PICK, SAYS IS A FL

33
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:51,658
BARON FOR COX.

34
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:53,961
IF HE WINDS UP IN THE PRIMARY,

35
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:55,195
THE GENERAL ELECTION, WITH THE

36
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:56,096
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, HE HAS NO

37
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,432
CHANCE OF WINNING.

38
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:00,400
>> JOHN COX CAN BE COMPETITIVE.

39
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,035
NOT AN EXPERT ON GOVERNORS

40
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:02,336
RACES.

41
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,871
WE ARE MONITORING THE GAS TAX

42
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:04,837
REPEAL, WHICH WILL BE ON THE

43
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:05,372
BALLOT.

44
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:07,875
THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE

45
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,176
MOTIVATOR DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY.

46
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:11,378
I WAS JUST OUT THERE.

47
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:13,780
GAS IS APPROACHING $5 A GALLON.

48
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,515
I DON'T SEE DEMOCRATS MARCHING

49
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:16,984
IN THE STREETS TO DEFEND THAT.

50
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:18,852
SO ACTUALLY, THERE IS A RECALL

51
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:20,654
ELECTION IN A STATE SENATE

52
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,422
DISTRICT BUT OVERLAPS WITH

53
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,358
CALIFORNIA'S 39TH DISTRICT, THE

54
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:25,092
DISTRICT OF RETIRING CONGRESSMAN

55
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:27,194
ED ROYCE.

56
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:28,795
VOTERS IN MY DISTRICT ARE TRYING

57
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:30,364
TO RECALL A DEMOCRAT WHO'S BEEN

58
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:32,799
AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF THE GAS

59
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,234
TAX, AND WE'LL GET VERY CLOSE IN

60
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:35,602
THE DISTRICT, MIGHT WIN

61
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:36,436
AND RECALL THAT STATE SENATOR.

62
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:39,406
I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE A

63
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:40,240
HARBINGER OF A REPUBLICANS

64
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,208
ENTHUSIASM IN THE FALL.

65
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,310
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT

66
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,644
ALABAMA.

67
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:44,545
CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA ROBY PICKED

68
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:46,213
UP THAT SEAT YEARS AGO, NOT THAT

69
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:47,714
LONG AGO, AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE

70
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:48,715
TONIGHT AND SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT

71
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,384
OUT OF THE PRIMARY, SHE'S GOING

72
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:59,927
TO HAVE TO RUN AGAINST A RUNOFF

73
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:00,594
CANDIDATE, SOMEONE WHO SHE'S

74
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:01,028
FACED BEFORE.

75
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:01,762
THINK OF THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE.

76
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:02,496
CONGRESSWOMAN ROBIE HAD A STRONG

77
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:03,230
SHOWING TONIGHT, AND OF COURSE,

78
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,764
WE STAND BEHIND HER.

79
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:04,398
AN INCUMBENT, PART OF THE

80
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:06,767
PRIMARY PATRIOT PROGRAM, AND WE

81
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:07,968
WILL SUPPORT HER IN JULY.

82
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:09,303
>> Shannon: WHAT OTHER RACES

83
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,338
ARE OF KEY INTEREST TO YOU?

84
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,773
A LOT OF FOCUS ON

85
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:13,307
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

86
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,007
DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THERE

87
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,676
WILL BE RACES WHERE YOU ARE ABLE

88
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,344
TO BOX OUT A DEMOCRAT FROM

89
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:19,313
GETTING INTO EITHER ONE OF THE

90
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:19,846
TWO TOP POSITIONS?

91
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,214
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD HAPPEN.

92
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,116
OUR GOAL HAS BEEN THE SAME ALL

93
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:23,684
ALONG.

94
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:24,851
WE JUST WANT TO GET A SINGLE

95
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:25,586
REPUBLICAN THROUGH TO THE

96
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:26,453
GENERAL, WE ARE PRETTY KEY THAT

97
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:29,590
IS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT.

98
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,991
WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON GET OUT

99
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,125
THE VOTE IN ORANGE COUNTY,

100
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,894
WEST COAST OFFICE THERE THAT HAS

101
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:36,063
MADE OVER A MILLION PHONE CALLS,

102
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:37,331
100 THOUSANDS OF DOORS DOWN

103
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:40,367
THERE, WE'VE ALSO DONE TARGETED

104
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,336
GET OUT THE VOTE ADS ON DIGITAL

105
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:42,703
PLATFORMS.

106
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,005
THE NAME OF THE GAME FOR US IS

107
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:46,239
TO ENSURE THAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS

108
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,274
TURNED OUT, ALSO, UP IN THE

109
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:51,211
CENTRAL VALLEY, THAT SEAT

110
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:51,945
UNEXPECTEDLY DEMOCRATS BUT THERE

111
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,681
IS A CHANCE, A POSSIBILITY, THE

112
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,415
TRIGGER REPUBLICANS GET IN

113
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:55,782
THERE.

114
00:02:55,782 --> 00:02:57,184
OF COURSE, WE STAND BEHIND

115
00:02:57,184 --> 00:03:01,221
CONGRESSMAN DENHAM.

116
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:02,089
ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRATS

117
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,290
ARE COMING UP SHORT.

118
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,325
IT SPEAKS TO THE INTRAPARTY

119
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,260
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS H

120
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,294
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS

121
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:07,327
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS E

122
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:07,361
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS O

00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:07,394
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS R

124
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:07,427
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS T

125
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:07,661
CIVIL WAR ACROSS        ACROSS C

126
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:07,961
PARTY.

127
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:08,762
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW THE

128
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:09,496
PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED TO WEIGH

129
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,965
IN ON SOME KEY RACES WITH

130
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:12,766
ENDORSEMENTS AND TWEETS AND

131
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:13,567
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

132
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,969
HOW DOES THAT PLAY IN PLACES

133
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,571
LIKE CALIFORNIA, A PLUS OR

134
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:17,871
MINUS?

135
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:18,605
>> IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO BE

136
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,773
ENDORSED BY THE LEADER OF YOUR

137
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:20,073
PARTY.

138
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,442
I CAN SPEAK FOR THE NRC SEE, WE

139
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:26,113
DON'T GET INVOLVED IN OPEN SEAT

140
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:27,914
PRIMARIES, WHOEVER EMERGES,

141
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:30,384
WE ALSO IMPORT THEM IN THE FALL.

142
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,786
WE ALSO STAND BEHIND THE MEMBERS

143
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:33,453
WE ALSO STAND BEHIND THE MEMBER

144
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:34,421
MEMBERS, CONGRESSMAN DANA

145
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,989
ROHRABACHER, CONGRESSMAN JEFF

146
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,357
DUNHAM, AND OTHER REPUBLICANS

147
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:39,393
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

148
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,027
AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

149
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:41,228
>> Shannon: GIVEN THE AMOUNT

150
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:42,596
OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND THE

151
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,330
CLOSENESS OF SOME OF THESE

152
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,731
RACES, IT MAY BE A LITTLE WHILE

153
00:03:44,731 --> 00:00:00,000
BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
