a generous way to look at it is that it was an experiment if as the Palestinians and those who say they support them argue the problem is the Israeli occupation Israelis our occupying one might say were two territories what is Gaza the other is the West Bank that so we named by the Jordanians needs to be Samaria and Judea so if the Israelis ended their occupation of one such territory would that not lead to a piece of our to negotiations for peace well maybe Gaza would turn into a kind of Singapore on the Mediterranean maybe it would be a good neighbor but that experiments didn't run and now we know and so that's why many Israelis perhaps most say if we were to leave the West Bank if we turn into a Gaza is a platform for continued and accelerated warfare against us the occupation therefore logically cannot be the problem something else must be the problem I think we know what it is I think we know that it's the Hamas cannot and as we say it is quite candid there can be no peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state but Fatah its rival the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas the present but this also is unable to say there is a Jewish state and recognize it and we're going to live peacefully as its neighbor he's not been able to say that that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
