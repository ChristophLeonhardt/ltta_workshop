but there's a difference between that
normal functioning of politics and
certain issues or certain moments where
I think our core values may be at stake
I would put in that category efforts to
round up kids who have grown up here in
and for all practical purposes are
American kids and send them someplace
else when they love this country they
are our kids friends and our and their
classmates and are now entering into
community colleges or in some cases
serving in our military that the notion
that we were just arbitrarily or because
of politics punish those kids when they
didn't do anything wrong themselves I
think would be something that would
merit me speaking out
