THAT IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE 
CONCERN FOR THE PRESIDENT THAT 
THIS WILL BE SEEN AS 
DELEGITIMIZING HIS VICTORY, 
WHICH IT DOESN'T. 
>>DO YOU THINK THAT SENSITIVITY 
IS PREVENTING HIM FROM BEING 
ENTIRELY CLEAR WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE RUSSIAN THREAT? 
>> THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE AROUND 
HIM PRIVATELY SUGGEST. 
>>OF COURSE THE THREAT AS WE 
HEAR FROM TECH REPORTERS AND 
PEOPLE WHO KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT 
THE SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD THAN YOU 
OR ME SAY THAT THREAT IS VERY 
MUCH A THERE. 
>> YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TECH 
EXPERTS. 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SAYS 
IT, LAWMAKERS ARE LED TO 
BELIEVE THAT IT COULD BE A 
PROBLEM AGAIN, STATE OFFICIALS 
WHO ARE RECEIVING -- ARE 
RAISING CONCERNS. 
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT 
INFLUENCES THE RESULT BUT THEY 
ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO 
UP AND VOTING OR POTENTIALLY 
THE RESULTS AND WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN IT. 
>> WHAT IS CONCERNING IS THERE 
HAVE BEEN INTELLIGENCE 
ASSESSMENTS THAT THE RUSSIA 
INTERFERENCE IS ONGOING AND 
THAT IT CONTINUES AS WE SPEAK. 
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IN HIS COMMENTS
WITH REPORTERS, WE ARE AWAITING 
ON THE TAPE, IS THAT HE SUGGESTS
THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL DO 
WHATEVER IT CAN TO STOP THIS 
FROM HAPPENING. 
I HAVE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THE 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE DOING 
THAT ALREADY. FOR HIM TO DOUBLE 
DOWN AND SUGGEST THAT HE IS 
GOING TO DO MORE CERTAINLY WILL 
BE REASSURING TO SOME WHO ARE 
CONCERNED THAT HE IS PERHAPS 
NOT DOING ENOUGH. 
>>I WANT TO GO BACK TO 
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR SCHUMER 
WAS SAYING EARLIER, THIS CALL 
FROM THE DEMOCRATS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT TO RELEASE HIS TAX 
RETURNS. 
WHY HAS THAT BEEN DIFFICULT FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO DO? 
EVERY PAST PRESIDENT HAS DONE 
THAT WHEN THEY WERE RUNNING, 
WHY NOT DO THAT NOW AND CLEAR 
THIS UP? 
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIM. 
HE HAS STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO DO 
IT. 
HE DID NOT FEEL THE NEED DURING 
THE ELECTION, HE WON SO WHAT IS 
THE HARM OF HOLDING IT BACK? 
THERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES 
IT, IT WAS JUST TRADITION. 
UNLESS IT IS LAW HE WILL HOLD 
ONTO THEM FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN.
ONE OTHER WAY IT COULD COME OUT 
IS THE ONGOING LEGAL CHALLENGES 
THAT HE FACES BOTH A DEFAMATION 
LAWSUIT FROM WOMEN WHO HAVE 
ALLEGED RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIM 
AND FROM THE OTHER ONGOING 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT 
ALL OR MORE ARE RELEASE. 
FOR HIM TO DO IT ON HIS OWN, 
THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT ANY 
TIME SOON. 
>>WHAT ABOUT THE 12 INDICTMENTS 
OF THE RUSSIANS? 
IT PUTS TO REST ANY IDEA OF 
WHAT IS GOING ON IS A WITCHHUNT.
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
SUPPORTERS WILL SEE IT AS SUCH. 
WHAT I THINK THIS CONTINUES TO 
DO IS THAT THERE WERE ATTEMPTS 
MADE BY RUSSIANS TO INTERFERE 
WITH AND POTENTIALLY METAL WITH 
THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION AND 
THEY FAIL. 
IT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR -- 
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT WE HAVE 
THE TAPE. 
>> -- WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD 
WITH OUR ALLIES. WE ARE GOING 
TO HAVE PEACE, THAT'S WHAT WE 
WANT AND THAT'S WHAT WE WILL 
HAVE. 
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. 
I HAVE HELPED THE NATO ALLIES 
BY INCREASING DEFENSE 
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR NATIVE 
ALLIES -- NATO ALLIES AND 
SECRETARY -- WAS FANTASTIC AS 
YOU KNOW HE REPORTED THAT THEY 
HAVE NEVER HAD AN INCREASE LIKE 
THIS IN THEIR HISTORY AND NATO 
WAS GOING DOWN AS OPPOSED TO 
GOING UP. 
I INCREASED IT BY THE MEETING 
LAST YEAR $44 MILLION. 
THIS YEAR IT WILL BE HUNDREDS 
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE 
COMING YEARS. 
I THINK THAT THERE IS GREAT 
UNITY WITH NATO. 
THERE IS A LOT OF POSITIVE 
THINGS HAPPENING. 
THERE IS A GREAT SPIRIT THAT WE 
DID NOT HAVE BEFORE AND A LOT 
OF MONEY THAT THEY WERE NOT 
PUTTING UP. 
THEY WERE NOT PAYING THEIR 
BILLS ON TIME AND NOW THEY ARE 
DOING THAT. 
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH TO SECRETARY STOLTENBERG, 
HE HAS BEEN TERRIFIC. 
WE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. 
I ALSO HAD MEETINGS WITH PRIME 
MINISTER MAY ON THE RANGE OF 
ISSUES CONCERNING OUR SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP. THAT IS BETWEEN 
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 
OURSELVES. 
WE MET WITH THE QUEEN WHO IS 
ABSOLUTELY A TERRIFIC PERSON 
WHERE SHE REVIEWED HER HONOR 
GUARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 70 
YEARS, THEY TELL ME. 
WE WALKED IN FRONT OF THE -- AND
THAT WAS VERY INSPIRING TO SEE 
AND TO BE WITH HER. I THINK THE 
RELATIONSHIP I CAN TRULY SAY IS 
A GOOD ONE. 
SHE WAS VERY INSPIRING. 
MOST RECENTLY I RETURNED FROM 
HELSINKI FINLAND AND I WAS 
GOING TO GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS 
ABOUT THE SUCCESS. 
AS SUCCESSFUL AS NATIVE WAS -- 
NATO WAS THIS WAS OUR MOST 
SUCCESSFUL VISIT. 
THAT HAD TO DO WITH RUSSIA. I 
MET WITH RUSSIA PRESIDENT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
TACKLE SOME OF THE MOST 
PRESSING ISSUES FACING HUMANITY.
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A WORSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA THEN 
WE WERE AS OF A FEW DAYS AGO 
AND I THINK THAT HAS GOTTEN 
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER AND IT HAS 
THE POSSIBILITY TO GET MUCH 
BETTER. 
I USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN 
THE CAMPAIGN THAT GETTING ALONG 
WITH RUSSIA WOULD BE A GOOD 
THING AND GETTING ALONG WITH 
CHINA WOULD BE A GOOD THING, 
NOT A BAD THING BUT A GOOD 
THING. 
WE ARE GREAT NUCLEAR POWERS. 
RUSSIA AND US HAVE 90 PERCENT 
OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
GETTING ALONG IS A POSITIVE 
THING AND NOT JUST FOR THAT 
REASON. 
I ENTERED THE MEETING WITH THE 
FIRM CONVICTION THAT DIPLOMACY 
AND ENGAGEMENT IS BETTER THAN 
HOSTILITY AND CONFLICT. 
I FEEL THAT WITH EVERYBODY. 
WE HAVE 29 MEMBERS IN NATO THAT 
I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OR 
AT LEAST GOOD RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH EVERYBODY. 
THE PRESS COVERED IT IN 
ACCURATELY THEY SAID I INSULTED 
PEOPLE. I WAS ASKING FOR PEOPLE 
TO PAY UP MONEY THAT THEY WERE 
SUPPOSED TO PAY, THEY SAY 
THAT'S INSULTING. 
WHEN I LEFT EVERYBODY WAS 
THRILLED. 
MY MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 
WAS REALLY INTERESTING IN SO 
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. 
WE HAVE NOT HAD RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH RUSSIA FOR A LONG TIME. 
WE STARTED. 
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT 
ONCE AGAIN, THE TOTAL FAITH AND 
SUPPORT FOR AMERICA'S 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, I HAVE 
FULL FAITH AND OUR INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES. 
THEY JUST TURNED OFF THE 
LIGHTS. 
THAT MUST BE DUE DILIGENCE. 
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY? THAT WAS 
STRANGE. 
THAT IS OKAY. 
I WILL BEGIN BY STATING THAT I 
HAVE FULL FAITH AND SUPPORT FOR 
AMERICA'S GREAT INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES, ALWAYS HAVE. 
I HAVE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT 
WHILE RUSSIA'S ACTIONS HAD NO 
IMPACT AT ALL ON THE OUTCOME OF 
THE ELECTION, LET ME BE TOTALLY 
CLEAR IN SAYING, I HAVE SAID 
THIS MANY TIMES, I ACCEPT OUR 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA'S 
MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION 
TOOK PLACE. THERE ARE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE OUT THERE, THERE WAS NO 
COLLUSION AT ALL. PEOPLE HAVE 
SEEN THAT AND THEY HAVE SEEN I 
STRONGLY. 
THE HOUSE HAS COME OUT STRONGLY
, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT 
STRONGLY. 
I FELT I MADE MYSELF VERY CLEAR 
BY HAVING JUST REVIEWED THE 
TRANSCRIPT, I HAVE TO SAY THAT 
I CAME BACK AND I SAID WHAT IS 
THE BIG DEAL. 
I HAVE A TRANSCRIPT AND I 
REVIEWED IT AND I WENT OUT AND 
I REVIEWED A CLIP OF AN ANSWER 
THAT I GAVE AND I REALIZED THAT 
THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME 
CLARIFICATION. 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS, I 
THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
OBVIOUS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO 
CLARIFY JUST IN CASE IT WAS 
NOT. 
IN A KEY SENTENCE IN MY REMARKS 
I SAID THE WORD WOULD INSTEAD 
OF WOULDN'T. 
INSTEAD OF SHOULD HAVE BEEN I 
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY I 
WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA. 
JUST TO REPEAT IT I SAID THE 
WORD WOULD INSTEAD OF WOULDN'T 
AND THE SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN I THOUGHT I WOULD BE MAYBE 
A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR ON THE 
TRANSCRIPT OR UNCLEAR ON THE 
ACTUAL VIDEO, THE SENTENCE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN I DON'T SEE 
ANY REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T BE 
RUSSIA, SORT OF A DOUBLE 
NEGATIVE. 
YOU CAN PUT THAT IN. 
I THINK THAT PROBABLY CLARIFIS 
THINGS PRETTY GOOD. 
I HAVE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS 
NOTED ON INTELLIGENCE FINDINGS 
THAT RUSSIA'S ATTEMPT TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS 
UNLIKE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS,
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY 
AND REPEAL ANY EFFORTS AND 
REPEL, WE WILL STOP IT AND WE 
WILL REPEL IT ANY EFFORTS TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS. WE 
ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR 
POWER TO PREVENT RUSSIA 
INTERFERENCE IN 2018. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER AND AS 
YOU KNOW PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS 
GIVEN INFORMATION JUST PRIOR TO 
THE ELECTION, THE LAST ELECTION 
2016 AND THEY DECIDED NOT TO DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 
THE REASON THEY DECIDED THAT 
WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ALL, THEY 
THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS 
GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION AND 
THEY DID NOT THINK IT WAS A BIG 
DEAL. 
WHEN I WON THE ELECTION THEY 
THOUGHT IT WAS A BIG DEAL AND 
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WENT INTO 
ACTION BUT IT WAS LATE. 
HE WAS GIVEN THAT IN SHARP 
CONTRAST TO THE WAY IT SHOULD 
BE. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA ALONG WITH 
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER AND THE 
WHOLE GROUP THAT YOU SEE ON 
TELEVISION GETTING PAID A LOT 
OF MONEY FROM THE NETWORKS, 
THEY KNEW ABOUT RUSSIA'S 
ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE IN THE 
ELECTION IN SEPTEMBER AND THEY 
TOTALLY BURIED AT. 
AS I SAID THEY BURIED IT 
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HILLARY 
CLINTON WAS GOING TO WIN. 
IT TURNED OUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN 
THAT WAY. 
BY CONTRAST MY ADMINISTRATION 
HAS TAKEN A VERY FIRM STANCE ON 
A STRONG ACTION. WE ARE GOING 
TO TAKE STRONG ACTION TO SECURE 
OUR ELECTION SYSTEM AND THE 
PROCESS. 
FURTHERMORE, AS HAS BEEN STATED 
AND WE HAVE STATED IT 
PREVIOUSLY ON MANY OCCASIONS, 
NO COLLUSION. 
YESTERDAY WE MADE SIGNIFICANT 
PROGRESS TOWARD ADDRESSING SOME 
OF THE WORST CONFLICTS. 
WHEN I MET WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 
FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS, WE 
TALKED ABOUT NUMEROUS THINGS 
AND AMONG THOSE THINGS ARE THE 
PROBLEMS THAT YOU SEE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST, WE ARE VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED, THEY ARE VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED, I ENTERED THE 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN FROM A POSITION OF 
TREMENDOUS STRENGTH. 
OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING AND THE 
MILITARY IS BEING FUNDED $716 
BILLION. IT WILL BE MORE 
POWERFUL AS A MILITARY THAN 
WHAT WE HAVE HAD BEFORE. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I ADDRESS 
THE RANGE OF ISSUES STARTING 
WITH THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA AND 
THE NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN AID 
AND HELP FOR PEOPLE IN SYRIA. 
WE ALSO SPOKE OF IRAN AND THE 
NEED TO HOLD NUCLEAR AMBITIONS 
AND DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES 
TAKING PLACE IN IRAN. AS MOST 
OF YOU KNOW WE ENDED THE IRAN 
DEAL WHICH WAS ONE OF THE WORST 
DEALS THAT ANYONE COULD 
IMAGINE. 
THAT HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON 
IRAN AND IT HAS SUBSTANTIALLY 
WEAKENED IRAN AND WE HOPE AT 
SOME POINT THEY CALL US AND WE 
MAKE A NEW DEAL. 
IRAN IS NOT THE SAME COUNTRY 
THAT IT WAS FIVE MONTHS AGO. 
THAT I CAN TELL YOU. 
THEY HAVE SOME BIG PROBLEMS 
THAT THEY CAN SOLVE MUCH EASIER 
IF THEY DEAL WITH US. 
WE DID DISCUSS IRAN, WE 
DISCUSSED ISRAEL AND THE 
SECURITY OF ISRAEL AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED NOW WITH US IN THE 
DISCUSSION WITH BENJAMIN 
NETANYAHU IN WORKING SOMETHING 
OUT WITH SURROUNDING SYRIA. 
SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO 
THE SECURITY AND LONG-TERM 
SECURITY OF ISRAEL. 
THE MAJOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION 
WAS NORTH KOREA AND THE NEED 
FOR IT TO REMOVE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS. 
RUSSIA HAS ASSURED US OF ITS 
SUPPORT. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS HE AGREES 
WITH ME 100 PERCENT THAT THEY 
WILL DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO 
TRY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. 
DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING AND 
THEY ARE GOING VERY WELL. 
WE HAVE NO RUSH FOR SPEED. 
THE SANCTIONS ARE REMAINING, 
THE HOSTAGES ARE BACK, THERE 
HAVE BEEN NO TESTS, NO ROCKETS 
GOING UP FOR A PERIOD OF NINE 
MONTHS. 
I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP IS 
VERY GOOD. 
WE WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES. 
WE HAVE NO TIME LIMIT, NO SPEED 
LIMIT. 
WE ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE 
PROCESS. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS GOING TO BE 
INVOLVED IN THE SENSE THAT HE 
IS WITH US AND HE WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE THAT HAPPEN. 
PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE 
MEETING WAS THE REDUCTION OF 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS THROUGHOUT THE 
WORLD. 
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA, 
90 PERCENT AS I SAID. WE CAN 
HAVE A BIG IMPACT BUT NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS IS THE GREATEST THREAT 
OF OUR WORLD TODAY. 
THEY ARE A GREAT NUCLEAR POWER 
AND WE ARE A GREAT NUCLEAR 
POWER. 
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
IT. 
THAT WAS A MATTER THAT WE 
DISCUSSED IN GREAT DETAIL AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AGREES WITH ME. 
THE MATTERS THAT WE DISCUSSED 
ARE PROFOUND AND IMPORTANT AND 
THEY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE 
MILLIONS OF LIVES. 
I UNDERSTAND MANY DISAGREEMENTS 
BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES AND I 
ALSO UNDERSTAND THE DIALOGUE 
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE 
DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA OR WITH 
OTHER COUNTRIES, DIALOGUE WITH 
RUSSIA IN THIS CASE WHERE WE 
HAVE HAD SUCH SQUARE 
RELATIONSHIPS, DIALOGUE IS VERY 
IMPORTANT AND IT IS A GOOD 
THING. 
IF WE GET ALONG WITH THEM 
GREAT, IF WE DON'T GET ALONG 
THEN WE DON'T GET ALONG. 
I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE 
OF HAVING SOME POSITIVE THINGS. 
I THOUGHT THAT THE MEETING THAT 
I HAD WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS 
REALLY STRONG. THEY WERE 
WILLING TO DO THINGS THAT 
FRANKLY I WAS NOT SURE THEY 
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO. WE WILL 
BE HAVING FUTURE MEETINGS AND 
WE WILL SEE IF THAT COMES TO 
FRUITION. 
I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR UP, I 
HAVE THE STRONGEST RESPECT FOR 
OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 
HEADED BY MY PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE, WHETHER 
IT IS GINA, DAN COATS, WE HAVE 
TREMENDOUS PEOPLE, TREMENDOUS 
TALENT WITHIN THE AGENCY. 
I THINK THEY ARE BEING GUIDED 
PROPERLY. 
AND WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING 
WE WANT SUCCESS FOR OUR COUNTRY.
WITH THAT WE WILL START A 
MEETING ON TAX REDUCTIONS. 
WE ARE GOING TO PUT IN A BILL, 
KEVIN BRADY IS WITH US. 
I MIGHT ASK KEVIN TO SAY A 
COUPLE OF WORDS AND THEN WE 
WILL GET BACK TO OUR PRIVATE 
MEETING. 
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE 
WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE HERE 
TODAY. 
PIECE THROUGH STRENGTH FOR FORM 
POLICY AND IT WORKS BEST WHEN 
AMERICA HAS A STRONG ECONOMY 
AND A STRONG MILITARY. 
UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP HOUSE AND 
SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE 
DELIVERING ON BOTH. TODAY IS 
ABOUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN 
AMERICANS -- AMERICA'S ECONOMY 
AND WE THINK THE BEST WAY TO 
START IS WITH MIDDLE-CLASS 
FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. 
TODAY WE ARE HERE TO TALK TO 
ABOUT MAKING PERMANENT TAX 
RELIEF, ONE, SO THEY CAN 
CONTINUE TO GROW. 
TWO, SO WE CAN ADD 1,000,000 
1/2 JOBS. 
AND THREE, SO WE CAN PROTECT 
THEM FROM A FUTURE WASHINGTON 
TRYING TO STEAL BACK THOSE HARD 
EARNED DOLLARS. 
>> THE TIME OF SUBMITTAL? 
>>WE ANTICIPATE THE HOUSE 
VOTING ON THIS IN SEPTEMBER AND 
THE SENATE SETTING A TIMETABLE 
AS WELL. 
>>THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>AND WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ADDRESSING THE CRITICISM 
OVER HIS SUMMIT WITH RUSSIA 
PRESIDENT LATIMER PUTIN. 
HE CAME OUT AND HE SAID I HAVE 
FULL SUPPORT FOR THE U. S. 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND HE 
ALSO SAID THAT HE ACCEPTS THAT 
THERE WAS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE 
IN THE 2016 ELECTION. 
THERE WAS HOWEVER NO COLLUSION. 
I AM GOING TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ED 
O'KEEFE. 
ED, WE DID HEAR THE PRESIDENT 
DISCUSS HIS MEETING WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND ALSO WITH 
NATO LEADERS. 
AT ONE POINT HE SAID PEOPLE MAY 
HAVE CRITICIZED ME FOR BEING A 
LITTLE HARSH WITH NATO LEADERS 
BUT THEY WERE NOT PAYING THEIR 
BILLS AND KNOW EVERYTHING IS 
FINE. 
AT NO POINT DID HE SAY HE EVER 
TOOK VLADIMIR PUTIN TO TASK FOR 
ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THE U. 
S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS 
BROUGHT UP. 
>>THAT IS RIGHT. 
THIS WAS A CLASSIC CLEANUP JOB. 
YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR THE MOP 
HITTING THE FLOOR TRYING TO 
CLEAN UP THE MESS THAT HE HAS 
CREATED. JUST TRYING TO 
REITERATE THAT WHILE HE 
APPRECIATES AND HE AGREES WITH 
THE ASSESSMENT OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND HIS 
FAITH IN THE LEADERSHIP OF 
THOSE AGENCIES. 
HE WAS SEEKING TO HAVE A BETTER 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA. 
HE IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS HE 
CAMPAIGNED ON THIS, HE WANTS TO 
SEE THE UNITED STATES WORKING 
IN BETTER SPIRITS WITH RUSSIA 
AND CHINA. 
THAT COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF 
UPSETTING ALLIES ALL OVER THE 
WORLD AND THE NATO ALLIANCE 
THAT CAUSES GREAT PAUSE FOR SO 
MANY CRITICS AND MEMBERS OF HIS 
OWN PARTY. 
TELLING IN HIS FIRST STATEMENT 
IS THAT HE SAYS I ACCEPT THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY -- 
COMMUNITY CONCLUSION AND HE 
ADDED IT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER 
PEOPLE ALSO. 
IT IS THOSE QUALIFIERS THAT HE 
PUTS ON THESE STATEMENTS THAT 
AGGRAVATES CRITICS AND BRINGS 
CONCERN AND PAUSE TO REPUBLICAN 
ALLIES. AGAIN, IT DEMONSTRATES 
HE CANNOT FOR WHATEVER REASON 
EXCEPT THAT AS FACT AND 
CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT 
OTHERS WERE ALSO INVOLVED. 
WHEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY SAYING 
OTHERWISE IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW 
THAT SQUARES? 
>> WHO WHEN HE REFERRED TO? 
HE SAID A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE. 
WHO IS HE REFERRING TO? 
>> HE DOES NOT SAY. 
HE HAS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK IT 
UP. 
LOOK, ONCE AGAIN THEY ARE 
REITERATING THAT THEY DISCUSSED 
THE SITUATION WITH IRAN, RUSSIA 
AND ISRAEL ARE WORKING TOGETHER 
WHEN IT COMES TO SYRIA. 
THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS 
DISCUSSED AMONG SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM AND OTHER MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS ABOUT THE COOPERATION. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE END OF 
THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM
AND REDUCING WEAPONS AND THEY 
SAID THEY WILL HAVE FUTURE 
MEETINGS. 
WHEN YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT 
SPANS 11 TIME ZONES TOUCHES ON 
THE MIDDLE EAST ALL THE WAY TO 
THE PACIFIC OCEAN IT IS 
INEVITABLE THAT THEY WILL 
DISCUSS A LOT OF ISSUES AND IT 
SEEMS LIKE THEY RAN THROUGH 
SEVERAL YESTERDAY. 
>>DOES IT SEEM TO YOU THAT THEY 
LOST OVER SYRIA? OBVIOUSLY THAT 
IS A POINT OF CONTENTION. 
>> HE DID NOT OFFER MUCH DETAIL 
AND THAT IS CONCERNING TO A LOT 
OF AMERICAN OFFICIALS AND OTHER 
OBSERVERS, WHAT DID HE DO OR SAY
, WHAT WAS DISCUSSED REGARDING 
RUSSIA'S WORK WITH ISRAEL AND 
ITS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN SYRIA 
AND UNITED STATES PRESENCE IN 
SYRIA. 
WE DO NOT KNOW AND HE DID NOT 
OFFER IT UP. 
FRANKLY, WE MAY NEVER KNOW. 
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE ALONG 
WITH THE TRANSLATOR. 
>>ALSO CONSIDERING THAT THIS 
MEETING CAME ON THE HEELS OF 
THE NATO SUMMIT THERE WAS NO 
MENTION OF A DISCUSSION OVER 
CRIMEA OR THE BALTIC STATES. 
>> REMEMBER PRESIDENT PUTIN 
SAYING IN HIS INTERVIEW THAT 
TRUMP RAISE THE ISSUE OF CRIMEA 
DURING THE MEETING AND THEY 
ESSENTIALLY AGREED TO DISAGREE. 
THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT 
IT CAME UP IF YOU BELIEVE 
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS CORRECT. 
IT DID COME UP IT IS JUST THAT 
HE DID NOT REITERATED AT HIS 
MEETING. 
INTERESTING IN HIS CONVERSATION 
WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS THAT 
THEY SUGGESTED THEY WILL HAVE A 
NEW PACKAGE OF POTENTIAL TAX 
REFORM PROPOSALS READY TO VOTE 
IN THE HOUSE IN SEPTEMBER. 
THAT WAS THE OFFICIAL REASON 
FOR THAT MEETING. PERHAPS BY 
HAVING REPORTERS COME IN FOR 
THAT PERHAPS IT WILL MOVE OFF 
OF THIS CONCERN THAT WENT ON 
DURING THE OVERSEAS TRIP. 
WE HAVE SEEN PRESIDENTS AND 
OTHER POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE TO 
DO THIS BEFORE, THIS WAS A BIT 
OF A CLEANUP ACT. 
WE WILL SEE IF IT HELPS REPAIR 
THE DAMAGE. 
>>HE SEEMED TO BE VERY FOCUSED 
ON ONE PARTICULAR STATEMENT 
THAT HE FEELS WAS MISUNDERSTOOD 
OR MISREAD. 
THAT STATEMENT ABOUT I SEE NO 
REASON TO NOT BELIEVE THAT 
RUSSIA WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE. 
WHY WAS HE SO CONCERNED WITH 
THAT ONE STATEMENT? 
>>HE SAID HE WENT BACK AND HE 
READ THE TRANSCRIPT AND HE SAW 
THE CLIPS AND REALIZED IT COULD 
BE MISCONSTRUED. 
WHAT HE SAYS HE SHOULD HAVE 
SAID WAS QUOTE, I DON'T SEE ANY 
REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T BE 
RUSSIA UNQUOTE WHO MEDDLED IN 
THE 2016 ELECTIONS. WHEN YOU 
DON'T SAY WOULDN'T AND YOU SAY 
WOULD THAT IS A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT STATEMENT. 
WHAT HE IS TRYING TO SUGGEST IS 
YES RUSSIA DID THIS I DON'T SEE 
WHY NOT. 
HE IS JUST TRYING TO CLEAN UP 
THAT PIECE. WHETHER HE COPOUT 
HIMSELF OR IF THAT WAS AT THE 
URGING OF OTHERS REMAINS 
UNCLEAR. 
ALSO WE WILL STOP IT AND REPEL 
ANY ATTEMPT TO MEDDLE IN THE U. 
S. ELECTIONS. 
THAT IS A BOLD STATEMENT WE 
WILL SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. 
ALL OF THAT FOR POTENTIAL 
HEARINGS, CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE 
AT THE CAPITAL IN THE COMING 
EEKS. 
DEMOCRATS INSIST THAT SECRETARY 
OF STATE POMPEO AND OTHER 
OFFICIALS COME BEFORE TO 
EXPLAIN WHAT THEY DID TO 
PREPARE THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY 
DID DURING THE MEETINGS AND 
AFTER THE MEETINGS. 
BOB CORKER SAID TODAY THAT HE 
IS ARRANGING TO HAVE THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE COME NEXT 
WEEK. 
YOU WILL SEE WHAT ELSE WE WILL 
LEARN THERE IS LEGISLATION ON 
THE TABLE AND WILL PUNISH 
RUSSIA FOR MEDDLING AGAIN IN 
THE MIDTERM ELECTION. 
úTHAT IS  
WE WILL SEE IF THAT GETS 
MOVEMENT. 
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 
McCONNELL SAID IT IS AMONG THE 
PROPOSALS THAT COULD BE WORTH 
VOTING ON. 
I THINK YOU WILL SEE A PUSH OF 
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES AND 
CHAMBERS TO TRY TO GET SOME 
KIND OF DEBATE GOING TO 
REITERATE AT LEAST CONGRESSES 
BELIEF THAT RUSSIA IS A BAD 
ACTOR WHEN IT COMES TO THIS AND 
THAT THEY SHOULD BE AND WOULD 
BE PUNISHED IF IT HAPPENS 
AGAIN. 
>>IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
IF THE SANCTIONS GAIN TRACTION. 
WAS THERE ANY EXPLANATION AS TO 
WHY THE LEADERS HAD TO MEET 
PRIVATELY? 
>> REPORTING FROM OUR 
COLLEAGUES AND OTHER OUTLETS 
SUGGEST THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WANTED TO DO IT IN PART BECAUSE 
HE WAS CONCERNED OF LEAKS FROM 
PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITH OTHER 
WORLD LEADERS. 
THAT AT LEAST IS ONE 
EXPLANATION THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN.
WHY OFFICIALS WOULD CONSENT TO 
IT OR WHETHER THEY REALLY 
PUSHED HARD TO HAVE IT BE 
OTHERWISE REMAINS UNCLEAR. 
REMEMBER THEY DID HAVE A LUNCH 
AFTERWARD WHERE THEY DID MEET 
WITH THEIR OTHER TOP AIDES. 
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO MET 
WITH THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND -- WAS MEETING 
WITH OTHER OFFICIALS AS WELL. 
FOR TWO HOURS THEY WERE ALONE 
WITH TRANSLATORS. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
DEMOCRATS SUGGESTED TODAY IS 
THAT THE NOTES OF THE U. S. 
INTERPRETER THAT WAS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE 
PUBLIC TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF 
WHAT WENT ON. 
WHETHER THE INTERPRETER HAS THE 
TIME AND TAKES A NOTE DURING OR 
RIGHT AFTER IS UNCLEAR TO ME. 
AT LEAST AN ATTEMPT TO FIGURE 
OUT WHAT WAS SAID AND DONE. 
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CBS 
NEWS LEARNED THAT SPECIAL 
COUNSELOR -- COUNSEL BOB 
MUELLER IS SEEKING IMMUNITY FOR 
FIVE WITNESSES WHO ARE SAID TO 
TESTIFY AGAINST PAUL MANAFORT. 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS ASKING 
THE JUDGE TO SEAL THE MOTION SO 
THAT THE WITNESSES IDENTITIES 
REMAIN SECRET. 
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS? 
>> THIS SUGGEST THAT THE BALL 
IS ROLLING. 
I AM TRYING TO FIND THAT 
GUIDANCE. I KNOW IT CAME IN A 
FEW MOMENTS AGO. BASICALLY HE 
IS ASKING THE JUDGE IN VIRGINIA 
TO SEAL MOTIONS THAT ASK FOR 
IMMUNITY IN RETURN FOR TRIAL 
TESTIMONY FOR FIVE INDIVIDUALS. 
THEY ARE NOT -- IF THEY DO NOT 
SEAL THE MOTIONS IT WOULD 
REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF THE 
WITNESSES, WE DO NOT KNOW WHO 
THEY ARE. 
THEY ARE THIRD PARTIES AND THEY 
ARE NOT CHARGED, ACCORDING TO 
THE MEMO TODAY THE FIVE PEOPLE 
WILL NOT TESTIFY OR PROVIDE 
INFORMATION UNDER THE BASIS OF 
SELF-INCRIMINATION. 
THEY WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO 
HAVE IMMUNITY. 
THIS IS IN THE MANAFORT CASE 
THAT CONTINUES IN FEDERAL COURT 
IN VIRGINIA. 
THAT IS A TRIAL SET TO BEGIN A 
WEEK TOMORROW IN THE EASTERN 
DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA. 
HE ALSO FACES FEDERAL CHARGES 
IN DC. 
>>WE WILL BE WATCHING THAT 
CLOSELY. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG IS 
WITH US NOW. 
DO YOU THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DID ENOUGH DAMAGE CONTROL? 
DO YOU THINK HE DID ENOUGH TO 
SATISFY HIS CRITICS BOTH AMONG 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS? 
>> I THINK IT IS TOO SOON TO 
TELL. 
RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE IS A 
WALKED BACK AND IT IS DUE 
DILIGENCE FOR WHAT HE HAD TO 
CORRECT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED 
YESTERDAY. 
WE KNEW THAT SENIOR 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE 
REALLY PRESSING HIM TO CLEAN 
THIS UP. 
IT WAS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THEM 
THAT HE DECLARE THAT HE 
BELIEVED THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY OVER VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
EVEN THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY THAT 
EXPLICITLY, HE DID MAKE REALLY 
IMPORTANT POINTS THAT CORRECT 
WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY DURING 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 
HE SAID HE HAS THE FULL FAITH 
AND SUPPORT IN THE U. S. 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHICH HE 
HAS BEEN SAYING, HERE'S THE 
DIFFERENCE, FOR THE FIRST TIME 
WHICH WE DID NOT HEAR YESTERDAY 
IS THAT HE SAID HE ACCEPTED THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S 
CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS IN 
FACT MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION. 
HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE 
PRESIDENT TO MAKE THAT 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
INTERFERENCE AND COLLUSION. 
>> I AGREE. 
HE NEVER POINTED OUT THAT HE 
PRESSED PRESIDENT PUTIN DURING 
ANY OF THIS. 
>> YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE SAID. 
HE ALSO SAID THAT HE MISSPOKE 
DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND 
HE MEANT TO SAY I DON'T SEE ANY 
REASON TO SAY WHY IT WOULDN'T 
BE RUSSIA. 
I HAVE THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IN FRONT 
OF ME. 
THE POINT IS, AFTER THAT HE 
SAID HE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY BUT 
ALSO PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS 
EXTREMELY STRONG AND POWERFUL 
IN HIS DENIAL TODAY. 
IF HE HAD MADE THAT CLAIM AS HE 
THOUGHT HE DID, WHICH I DON'T 
SEE WHY IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
-- WOULD HAVE BEEN RUSSIA WHY 
DID YOU NOT DENOUNCE VLADIMIR 
PUTIN RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT 
WHEN HE WAS NEXT YEAR. 
HE DID NOT DO THAT TODAY EITHER.
HE DID NOT DELIVER A MESSAGE TO 
PUTIN THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT 
YOU MAY HAVE THINK I CONVEYED 
YESTERDAY THE BOTTOM LINE IS 
THAT THE U. S. WILL NOT ACCEPT 
THIS AND WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID. 
I ACCEPT WHAT MY INVESTIGATORS 
HAVE FOUND AND THERE WILL BE 
CONSEQUENCES IN THE FUTURE. 
ALL OF THAT TOUGH LANGUAGE WE 
DID IN HERE. 
>>WE HEARD THE TOUGH LANGUAGE 
WHEN IT CAME TO NATO AND 
LEADERS NOT PAYING THEIR BILLS 
BUT WE DID NOT HEAR THAT 
LANGUAGE WHEN IT COMES TO 
CALLING OUT PRESIDENT PUTIN. 
>>PRECISELY. 
THIS WAS ANOTHER VICTORY LAP 
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IN TERMS OF 
NATO SAYING IT IS BECAUSE OF 
HIS RHETORIC AND HIS DEMANDS 
THAT THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOW 
COMMITTED TO PAYING THEIR FAIR 
SHARE AND SO HE SAID THAT WAS 
IMPORTANT TO GET THE RESULT 
THAT HE WANTED. 
BUT HE COULD HAVE USED THAT 
SAME TOUGH LANGUAGE FOR 
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO SEND A 
MESSAGE THAT THE RESULT HAS TO 
BE YOU DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN 
ESPECIALLY WITH OUR MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS RIGHT AROUND THE 
CORNER. 
HE WAS NOT FORCEFUL. 
AND DESPITE EVERYTHING HE SAID 
TODAY, REMEMBER THAT MOUNTAIN 
OF PRESSURE FOR HIM TO DO SO, 
WE ALL WATCHED WHAT HAPPENED 
WHEN HE WAS STANDING NEXT TO 
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
HE STILL HAS TO ANSWER MANY 
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY HE DID NOT 
EXPRESS THAT TO PUTIN IF HE DID
, IN FACT, BELIEVE THERE WAS 
MEDDLING. 
DOES THAT MEAN HE WAS 
COMPLACENT IN RUSSIA'S 
INTERFERENCE? 
IF NOT WHY DID HE NOT PRESS HIM 
IF HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY ON THE 
WORLD STAGE TO DO THAT? 
THAT IS SOMETHING HE HAS NOT 
ANSWERED. 
>> WEIJIA JIANG AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
WE WILL LET YOU GET OUT OF THE 
POURING RAIN. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> CBS NEWS CHIEF 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT 
NANCY QUARTERS JOINS US NOW. 
ARE LAWMAKERS BREATHING A SIGH 
OF RELIEF NOW THAT LONG -- HE 
HAS WALKED BACK SOME OF HIS 
REMARKS? 
>> I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME 
RELIEF THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS A 
HEALTHY ENOUGH APPRECIATION FOR 
THE FIRESTORM THAT HIS COMMENTS 
HAVE CREATED THAT HE WAS 
WILLING TO COME OUT TODAY AND 
WALK SOME OF THE BACK, BUT IT 
IS A LOW BAR. 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HERE 
ON CAPITOL HILL KNOW WHERE HIS 
HEART IS AND HIS COMMENTS 
BEFORE THE CAMERAS TODAY ARE 
NOT GOING TO QUELL THE 
QUESTIONS FROM BOTH SIDES ABOUT 
WHAT WAS SAID IN THAT TO OUR 
PRIVATE MEETING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD WITH PUTIN. 
THEY WANT THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE TO COME UP TO CAPITOL 
HILL NEXT WEEK AND TESTIFY 
ABOUT WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AND 
WHY THE PRESIDENT IGNORED THE 
ADVICE AND THE INFORMATION THAT 
WAS GIVEN TO HIM BY HIS OWN 
TEAM. 
YOU ALSO HAD TODAY THE TRULY 
REMARKABLE SITE OF THE SENATE 
MAJORITY LEADER, MITCH 
McCONNELL, COMING OUT AT HIS 
WEEKLY PRESS CONFERENCE AND 
FEELING COMPELLED TO SEND A 
MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO EUROPE 
REASSURING OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES 
THAT WE ARE THEIR FRIENDS AND 
THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE NOT OUR 
FRIENDS. 
I ASKED HIM WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT 
THE STATE OF OUR GOVERNMENT 
THAT HE HAD TO ISSUE THAT 
REASSURANCE, SURELY THE 
EUROPEAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE 
FOR GRANTED THAT WE ARE THEIR 
FRIENDS. 
HE SAID IT IS ALWAYS NICE TO 
REMIND YOUR LONGTIME FRIENDS OF 
THAT SOLIDARITY EVERY ONCE IN A 
WHILE. 
CLEARLY THOSE ARE NOT WORDS 
THAT THE MAJORITY LEADER EVER 
THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE TO UTTER. 
IT IS A SIGN AT HOW PERTURBED 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE 
OVER WHAT THEY SAW IN HELSINKI 
YESTERDAY. ONE CORRECTION FROM 
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO 
CHANGE THAT. 
>>I ALSO THINK AT THIS POINT IT 
IS EASY TO INFER, THIS WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THE MOMENT TO SAY IT 
THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT PUSH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN ON ANY OF THESE 
POINTS. 
ONE CAN INFER HAD HE PUSHED HIM 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOMENT 
TO SAY I TOLD HIM HE CANNOT DO 
THIS. 
HE HAS NOT SAID THAT. 
IT IS EASY TO INFER THAT HE DID 
NOT BRING IT UP. 
>> I SHOULD BRING UP EVEN IN 
THE SO-CALLED CORRECTION, THE 
VERY NEXT BREATH AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT SAID I TRUST OUR 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HE WENT 
ON TO SAY THAT RUSSIA 
INTERFERENCE DID NOT CHANGE THE 
OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, IT DID 
NOT INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME IN 
ANY WAY. 
THAT IS NOT WITH THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FOUND. 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
FOUND THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO 
KNOW HOW RUSSIA INTERFERENCE 
AFFECTED AN ELECTION THAT WAS 
THIS CLOSE. 
IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES YOU CANNOT SAY I 
TRUST THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY BUT I AM ONLY GOING 
TO CHERRY PICK THE INFORMATION 
THAT THEY GATHERED THAT I LIKE 
AND THE REST OF IT I WILL 
DISCARD AND CREATE MY OWN 
TRUTH. 
THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. 
>>WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT 
INTERFERENCE THAT THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS 
FOUND. 
THERE ARE INTANGIBLES TO THAT. 
HE ALSO SAID COULD HAVE BEEN 
OTHER PEOPLE TOO, LOTS OF OTHER 
PEOPLE OUT THERE, IT WAS SORT 
OF A QUALIFIER TO HIS 
ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITIES ASSESSMENT. 
WHAT DID THAT MEAN? 
>>THAT MEANS THAT HE IS STILL 
UNWILLING, DESPITE THE 
INFORMATION THAT HE HAS BEEN 
GIVEN REPEATEDLY OVER THE PAST 
TWO YEARS TO CONFIRM THAT IT 
WAS RUSSIA AND RUSSIA ALONE 
THAT PLAYED THIS MAJOR ROLE IN 
THE 2016 ELECTION. 
IT IS UNCLEAR WHY HE FEELS THE 
NEED TO DILUTE THAT WHEN HE 
DOES AGREE THAT IT WAS RUSSIA. 
HE HASN'T DONE IT IN THE PAST 
FROM TIME TO TIME HE ALWAYS 
PUTS IN THE QUALIFIER THAT 
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN OTHERS AS 
WELL OR THAT THE U. S. -- WHICH 
IS TYPICALLY NOT WITH THE U. S. 
PRESIDENT WOULD ADMIT 
ESPECIALLY A PRESIDENT WHO WENT 
SO FAR ON HIS PREDECESSOR 
SAYING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD 
GONE AN APOLOGY TOUR OF THE 
WORLD. 
THAT IS PART OF THE REASON THAT 
YOU ARE SEEING THIS GROUNDSWELL 
TODAY AMONG REPUBLICANS IN 
SUPPORT OF A PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION THAT WAS NOT GOING 
ANYWHERE UNTIL THIS WEEK. 
IT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD BY 
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO OF FLORIDA, 
REPUBLICAN. 
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN A DEMOCRAT 
FROM MARYLAND AND IT WOULD GIVE 
CONGRESS THE POWER TO IMPOSE 
NEW SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA 
UNILATERALLY IF RUSSIA MEDALS 
IN THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS 
OR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS. 
THAT IS A CLEAR SIGN. 
YOU EVEN HEARD MITCH McCONNELL 
SAY TODAY THAT HE IS INTERESTED 
IN THAT LEGISLATION. 
THAT IS MEANT TO SEND A SIGNAL 
TO THE PRESIDENT AND TO THE 
RUSSIANS, WE DO NOT TRUST THAT 
THE RUSSIANS WILL NOT TRY THIS 
AGAIN AND WE DO NOT TRUST THAT 
OUR OWN PRESIDENT, THE LEADER 
OF OUR OWN PARTY WOULD BE 
WILLING TO ISSUE WARNINGS TO 
RUSSIA OR TO PUNISH THEM IF 
THEY WERE TO TRY THIS AGAIN. 
YOU HAVE GOT REPUBLICANS IN 
CONGRESS SAYING THAT THEY NEED 
TO TAKE THINGS INTO THEIR OWN 
HANDS. 
>> DO YOU THINK THE LEGISLATION 
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL? 
>> IT IS POSSIBLE. 
IT WAS NOT ON THE RADAR SCREEN 
24 HOURS AGO SO IT WILL TAKE 
TIME TO MARINATE. 
WE NEED TO SEE IF THIS ISSUE 
REMAINS IN THE FOREFRONT FOR 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 
THE FACT THAT THE SENATE 
MAJORITY LEADER IS TALKING 
ABOUT IT, IT IS USUALLY A 
PRETTY GOOD SIGN THAT THIS IS 
LEGISLATION THAT HE WAS 
SERIOUSLY -- HE IS SERIOUSLY 
BRINGING TO THE FOREFRONT. 
-- THAT HE IS NOT PREPARED TO 
SEE MOVED TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND 
BEYOND THAT THERE IS ALSO TALK 
OF PERHAPS SOME KIND OF 
RESOLUTION THAT CONGRESS COULD 
PASS REITERATING SUPPORT FOR 
THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
AND ITS FINDINGS SINCE THE 
PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE SUCH A 
TENUOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR 
THOSE FINDINGS DEPENDING ON THE 
DAY. 
>>THIS IS ONE PIECE OF 
BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION THAT 
COULD HAVE A FUTURE. 
NANCY CORTEZ THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT 
ELIZABETH PALMER JOINS US NOW 
FROM MOSCOW. 
HOW HAS MOSCOW BEEN REACTING TO 
THE SUMMIT? 
>> Reporter: YESTERDAY THEY 
WERE DELIGHTED. 
IN FACT THE RUSSIA FOREIGN 
MINISTER RIGHT AFTER THE TALKS 
FINISHED SAID TO ONE OF THE 
RUSSIAN MAGAZINES, VERY KREMLIN 
FRIENDLY MAGAZINE, THESE TALKS 
WERE BETTER THAN SUPER HE USED 
THE RUSSIAN WORD THAT MEANS 
FABULOUS. 
THEY WERE OVER THE MOON AND 
VARIOUS SENIOR POLITICIANS SAID 
THIS IS A TURNAROUND MOMENT. 
WE ARE GOING TO RESET THE 
RELATIONSHIP AND SO ON. 
BY THIS MORNING THE SOBER 
VOICES LOOKING AT THE BACKLASH 
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
PERFORMANCE IN THE UNITED 
STATES SAID THIS MAY NOT BE SO 
GOOD AFTER ALL BECAUSE IT MAY 
MAKE TALKS WITH RUSSIA SO TOXIC 
THAT WE CANNOT GET ANOTHER 
ROUND. 
THE RUSSIANS REALLY WANT WHAT 
HAPPEN IN HELSINKI TO BE THE 
FIRST STEP IN A WHOLE SERIES OF 
TALKS AND SUMMITS AND 
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WOULD 
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE LIFTING 
OF SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. 
>>WHAT MORE HAVE YOU HEARD IN 
TERMS OF DETAIL OUT OF THAT TO 
OUR MEETING? 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE 
SOME THINGS ING REPORTED IN THE 
RUSSIA PRESS THAT WE HAVE NOT 
HAD REPORTED HERE ABOUT WHAT 
THEY TALKED ABOUT. 
>> Reporter: THE RUSSIANS ARE 
PUTTING A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON 
ARMS CONTROL TALKS AND ALSO 
SOME SORT OF AN ARRANGEMENT IN 
SYRIA. 
THEY ARE SPECULATING THAT IT 
MAY MEAN ASKING THE U. S. TO 
PULL RIGHT OUT OF SYRIA AND IN 
RETURN FOR RUSSIA TAKING OVER 
AND TRYING TO CORRAL IRAN INTO 
THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY, AWAY 
FROM THE ISRAELI BORDER. 
>>SO THERE WAS DISCUSSION OVER 
MIDDLE EASTERN POLICY. 
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
DISCUSSION WITH NORTH KOREA? 
>> YES. 
>> WHAT DID YOU HEAR? 
>> NO MORE THAN, PRETTY MUCH AS 
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT RUSSIA 
SAID A LOT OF PLATITUDES WHICH 
ARE ALSO TRUE ON HOW NORTH KOREA
NEEDS TO SCALE BACK THEIR 
WEAPONS -- BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD 
ANY DETAILS THAT RUSSIA WOULD 
TAKE THE LEAD. 
FOR THE MOMENT NO DETAIL. 
>>REMIND US WHAT IS THE 
KREMLIN'S OFFICIAL STANCE ON 
THE ALEXA -- ELECTION MEDDLING? 
>> Reporter: DIDN'T DO IT. 
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT. 
WE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT. 
THEY ACTUALLY LINE UP WITH 
DONALD TRUMP OR AT LEAST THE 
POSITION THAT HE APPEARE TO 
TAKE WHICH IS THE MUELLER 
INQUIRY IS A WITCHHUNT IT IS 
MISINFORMATION, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S FOES ARE TRYING TO 
WEAKEN HIM BY ATTACKING HIM 
WITH THE FACTS OF THE INQUIRY. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
MORE NEWS WHEN WE RETURN.
