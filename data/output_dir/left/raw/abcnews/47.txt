STEPHANOPOULOS.

3
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:03,169
>>> GOOD DAY.

4
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,337
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 

5
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,771
THE SENATE HAS JUST TAKEN A VOTE

6
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:06,672
THAT WILL CLEAR THE WAY TO 

7
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:07,874
REOPENING THE GOVERNMENT THE 

8
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,210
THIRD DAY INTO A GOVERNMENT 

9
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:10,477
SHUTDOWN.

10
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,179
THAT'S A LIVE LOOK ON THE SENATE

11
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,380
FLOOR AFTER THE VOTE HAS BEEN 

12
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,514
TAKEN ON A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE

13
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:16,749
WHERE THE SENATORS HAVE AGREED 

14
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:18,351
TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO 

15
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,086
REOPEN UNTIL FEBRUARY 8th, THREE

16
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,054
MORE WEEKS, IN RETURN FOR A 

17
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:23,589
COMMITMENT TO GET A VOTE ON THAT

18
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,459
BILL TO PROTECT THE DREAMERS.

19
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,660
800,000 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE 

20
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,229
BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY AS 

21
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,697
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.

22
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,998
THAT DEMAND BY DEMOCRATS, THAT 

23
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,766
THERE BE SOME KIND OF A VOTE ON 

24
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:36,569
DACA, TIED TO THE GOVERNMENT 

25
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,736
FUNDING, HAS BEEN WHAT HELD UP 

26
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:38,971
THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING OVER 

27
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,740
THESE LAST THREE DAYS BUT NOW A 

28
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,941
BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN 

29
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,109
REACHED TO SECURE A VOTE 

30
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:43,676
SOMETIME IN FEBRUARY.

31
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,778
I WANT TO GO TO OUR SENIOR 

32
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:46,613
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT MARY

33
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,214
BRUCE FOR MORE ON THIS.

34
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,117
MARY, WHAT YOU SAW HERE IS 

35
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:52,785
REALLY THE OLD-FASHIONED SENATE.

36
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:53,853
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN THE

37
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,354
MIDDLE COMING TOGETHER TO FORCE 

38
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:58,491
THE HANDS OF THEIR LEADERS.

39
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,292
>> Reporter: YEAH, GEORGE, IT 

40
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,627
DOES APPEAR THAT COMPROMISE IS 

41
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,627
ALIVE AND WELL HERE IN 

42
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:02,362
WASHINGTON AFTER ALL.

43
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,563
THERE HAS BEEN A FRANTIC SERIES 

44
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:05,565
OF NEGOTIATIONS HERE OVER THE 

45
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,400
WEEKEND UP TO THIS MORNING.

46
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,568
THIS WENT REALLY DOWN TO THE 

47
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,202
WIRE HERE.

48
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,538
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, THEY WERE 

49
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,039
ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AROUND 

50
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,541
THIS DEAL, THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR 

51
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,310
AGREEING TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT 

52
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,678
TEMPORARILY FOR THESE NEXT THREE

53
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:19,712
WEEKS LEADER McCONNELL, THE 

54
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:20,780
REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE SENATE,

55
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,382
MADE A COMMITMENT THAT HE WOULD 

56
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,418
TAKE UP AND ACT ON IMMIGRATION 

57
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,421
LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THESE 

58
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:28,688
DREAMERS.

59
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,355
AND I'M TOLD WHAT REALLY PUSHED 

60
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,122
IT OVER THE LINE FOR DEMOCRATS 

61
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:31,757
IS THAT HE AGREED THAT IF THEY 

62
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,059
CAN'T REACH AN AGREEMENT BY 

63
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,360
FEBRUARY 8th HE THEN MADE A 

64
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,194
COMMITMENT THAT HE WOULD 

65
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,063
IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP SOME KIND OF

66
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,099
LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS DACA AND 

67
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,533
THE DREAMERS.

68
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,734
BUT GEORGE, THIS ALL COMES DOWN 

69
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,069
TO A COMMITMENT BY MITCH 

70
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,870
McCONNELL.

71
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,537
SO DEMOCRATS HERE ARE 

72
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,906
ESSENTIALLY TAKING HIM AT HIS 

73
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,175
WORD, WHICH COULD BE A BIT OF A 

74
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,410
RISK.

75
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:50,977
BUT DEMOCRATS THAT WE HAVE 

76
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:51,910
TALKED TO IN THE LAST HOUR AS 

77
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,278
THIS HAS BEEN COMING TOGETHER 

78
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:53,979
ESSENTIALLY TOLD US THEY THOUGHT

79
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,381
THIS WAS GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS 

80
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,482
IT WAS GOING TO GET.

81
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,017
IN FACT, ONE SENATOR USING THE 

82
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,352
WORDS OF THE ROLLING STONES TO 

83
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,319
EXPLAIN YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET 

84
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,121
WHAT YOU WANT BUT IF YOU TRY 

85
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,289
SOMETIMES YOU JUST MIGHT FIND, 

86
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,390
GEORGE, YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED.

87
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,093
>> AND ONE THING THEY DIDN'T 

88
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:07,727
GET, GEORGE, IS ANY COMMITMENT 

89
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,526
TO SEE THE SAME KIND OF 

90
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,294
CONSIDERATION IN THE HOUSE.

91
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,729
>> YEAH, THAT'S STILL THE BIG 

92
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,497
QUESTION HERE.

93
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:12,665
WHAT COMES NEXT IN THE HOUSE?

94
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,766
NOW, PAUL RYAN HAS SAID THAT HE 

95
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,302
WOULD TAKE UP A VOTE ON THIS 

96
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,537
TEMPORARY FUNDING DEAL.

97
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,038
BUT WILL THEY MAKE THE SAME 

98
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,506
COMMITMENT TO ACT ON DREAMERS 

99
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,107
GOING FORWARD?

100
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,708
THAT REMAINS A BIG QUESTION.

101
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,110
AND OF COURSE WHAT WILL THE 

102
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,178
PRESIDENT DO NEXT AS WELL.

103
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,612
>> I WANT TO GO TO SENIOR WHITE 

104
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:28,181
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA

105
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,115
FOR MORE ON THAT.

106
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,317
THE PRESIDENT TAKING SOME HEAT 

107
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,685
FROM SENATOR SCHUMER AS HE 

108
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,485
ANNOUNCED THIS AGREEMENT SAYING 

109
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,854
THE PRESIDENT WAS LARGELY ABSENT

110
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,055
FROM THESE NEGOTIATIONS, THE 

111
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,157
DEMOCRATS NEVER KNEW WHERE HE 

112
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,458
STOOD ON THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER 

113
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,193
THE IMMIGRATION BILL, AND THIS 

114
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:42,495
WAS WORKED OUT IN THE SENATE IN 

115
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,095
THESE FINAL HOURS.

116
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:44,196
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE CAN CLAIM 

117
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:46,165
CREDIT FOR NOT BACKING DOWN TO 

118
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,101
THAT DEMOCRATIC DEMAND THAT ANY 

119
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:49,802
CONSIDERATION OF DACA, THAT ANY 

120
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,203
PASSAGE OF DACA BE TIED TO 

121
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:51,703
GOVERNMENT FUNDING.

122
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,205
>> YEAH, THAT WAS CERTAINLY OUR 

123
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,374
REPORTING HERE, GEORGE, THAT THE

124
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,207
WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO STAND 

125
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,043
FIRM ON THAT AND NOT BUDGE.

126
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:57,877
THEY REALLY FELT LIKE THE 

127
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,112
DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO CAVE AND

128
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,146
COME UNDER FIRE.

129
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,347
AND REALLY THAT'S WHAT MANY OF 

130
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,181
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FACING RIGHT 

131
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:02,582
NOW.

132
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,716
A LOT OF THE INITIAL REACTION 

133
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,351
COMING IN IS THAT PEOPLE ARE 

134
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,886
SAYING DEMOCRATS CAVED AND THEY 

135
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,186
SURRENDERED.

136
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,654
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT WILL 

137
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,256
PROBABLY TAKE A VICTORY LAP.

138
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,524
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE 

139
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,792
HEAR FROM HIM SOON HERE AT THE 

140
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,159
WHITE HOUSE.

141
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,827
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, MUCH 

142
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,995
OF THE NARRATIVE COMING OUT OF 

143
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,929
THESE NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE LAST

144
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:19,598
THREE AND FOUR DAYS IS EXACTLY 

145
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,633
WHAT CHUCK SCHUMER JUST SAID 

146
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,801
RIGHT THERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR,

147
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,835
THAT THE PRESIDENT -- HE CALLED 

148
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,139
HIM THE GREAT DEAL MAKER, GREAT 

149
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,006
DEAL-MAKING PRESIDENT BUT HE 

150
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,408
HADN'T ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO HIM 

151
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,208
SINCE LAST FRIDAY, AND WE DO 

152
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,676
KNOW FROM SOURCES HERE AT THE 

153
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:31,644
WHITE HOUSE THAT WHILE THE 

154
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,745
PRESIDENT SPENT MANY OF THE LAST

155
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,181
FEW DAYS OF THIS WEEKEND IN THE 

156
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,615
OVAL OFFICE ON THE PHONE HE 

157
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:37,684
DIDN'T ACTUALLY CALL ANY 

158
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:37,951
DEMOCRATS.

159
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,185
SO YOU KNOW, THIS WILL CERTAINLY

160
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,887
BE THE NARRATIVE GOING FORWARD.

161
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,321
DID HE SIT ON THE SIDELINES TOO 

162
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:42,689
MUCH?

163
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,624
CAN HE REALLY TAKE THE CREDIT 

164
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:46,926
FOR THE RESULTS THAT WE ARE 

165
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:47,660
SEEING TODAY?

166
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,194
WE WILL SEE.

167
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,428
>> AND CAN THEY ACTUALLY GET TO 

168
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,996
AN AGREEMENT ON THE OVERALL 

169
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:51,697

OR WILL WE BE RIGHT BACK IN THE
