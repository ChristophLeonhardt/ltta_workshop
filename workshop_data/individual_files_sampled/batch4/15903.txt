well you know the Liberals have really screwed up royally when they receive condemnation from all sides of the political spectrum and indeed such as the case right now regarding that inexplicable announcement that Canada will be sending peacekeeper troops to Mali this summer but in the department of making lemonade when one is left holding a basket full of lemons I think I have a terrific idea on how we can make the MAL a mission glorious rather than gruesome now by all accounts sending Canadian troops to Mali is a bloodbath in waiting ostensibly this is a peacekeeping mission but it's really mission impossible given that there's no peace to keep in Malley indeed since 2013 more than 160 UN peacekeepers have been killed a number that creeps upward almost on a weekly basis make no mistake malli is a war zone thus if there's no peace to maintain it would seem to me there's really only two viable options either we stay the hell out of Mali or we declare all-out war on the various gangsters thugs and terrorists who now make malli their home what you don't do is take part in a virtue signaling exercise by sending Canadian peacekeepers into a battle zone in which only the Grim Reaper will be victorious alas the Trudeau Liberals are resisting criticism from those on both the left and the right which again tells you how foolhardy this mission is so it is that Canadian soldiers will be Mally bound come summertime and as the saying goes unfortunately there will be blood however it doesn't have to be this way for there is indeed a Plan B and it is this if we really must send Canadians to Africa then perhaps what we really need to do is send certain Canadians there which is to say not those proud folk wearing Canadian Forces uniforms but rather those Canadians who we already know have a lust for violence and should these Canadians die in the line of duty well truthfully told precious few will mourn their passing naturally I speak of those returning Isis fighters to Canada oh sure the Liberals want to reprogram these subpar Sharia scholars it's all about hug-a-bug these days so forget about jail and say hello to poetry class 101 yet I say being confined in a class room in reciting Walt Whitman poems all day makes for cruel and unusual punishment instead let's give these soldiers of Allah some camouflage fatigues and a shiny baby blue UN helmet and then simply unleash them so that they may enjoy themselves in their own unique Isis fashion in fact I hereby nominate Omar Carter as leader of this particular Suicide Squad and talk about a cosmic coincidence folks according to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale the government has identified about 250 people with links to Canada who are suspected of traveling overseas to engage in terrorist activity yes 250 that happens to be the exact same number of Canadian troops the Liberals want to dispatch to Mally so as far as I can tell my plan is foolproof and failsafe our Patriots get to sit out this bloodbath while our parasites try to kill some equally odious folk who really need to be killed and if our homegrown version of Team Isis should fail in battle hey that's even more good news Canada loses some jihadis while those defunct Isis enthusiasts get to realize a lifelong dream namely finally getting to meet those 72 voluptuous black eyed virgins as they ascend the stairway to heaven for a rendezvous with mr. Allah Himself now that's what I call win-win for the rebel dawn media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks have you heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
