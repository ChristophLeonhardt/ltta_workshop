TENSIONS FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAVE BEEN ESCALATING AS PALESTINIANS VIOLENTLY PROTESTED AGAINST THE ISRAELI BLOCKADE AGAINST GAZA.

SOME WERE VIOLENT MILITANTS, ATTACKING THE SECURITY FENCE, OTHERS WERE UNARMED PROTESTERS, JOURNALISTS AND A 21-YEAR-OLD FEMALE MEDIC THAT WAS TREATING WOUNDED PALESTINIANS. THE CEASE FIRE WILL BE TESTED AGAIN WE THINK ON TUESDAY WHEN WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE MORE PROTESTS ALONG THE ISRAELI SECURITY FENCE. THIS IS THE DAY ON TUESDAY THAT PALESTINIANS ARE MARKING THE 51 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARAB DEFEAT DURING THE SIX-DAY WAR WHEN ISRAEL TOOK CONTROL OF JERUSALEM.
