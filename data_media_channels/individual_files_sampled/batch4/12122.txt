all I can say is this the easiest way to avoid running with the cops is not to have a run-in with the cops meaning that meaning that as a general rule you know the the the virtually every immigrant community the United States will take as an example virtually every immigrant community to the United States originally had lots of problems with the cops the Jewish community early in the 20th century had a lot of problems with the cops in New York the Italian community had lots of problems with the cops the Irish community the German community the Hispanic community virtually all of them when they came to the United States had significant community had significant problems with the cops as crime rates declined in those communities it turns out that the problems with the cops tend to disappear and so the easiest way to get rid of a lot of these problems is not to put all the onus on the cops but to say okay the cops are human they're gonna make some bad mistakes and we need to prosecute them if they do something really terrible obviously but if you really want to tackle this thing on a systemic level crime rates have to go down
