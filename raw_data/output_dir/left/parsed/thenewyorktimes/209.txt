The story of the $130,000
hush payment to porn star
Stormy Daniels has
gotten chaotic.
It all started when Trump’s
lawyer, Michael Cohen,
said he paid Daniels
with his own money.
Here’s what we know.
Does Trump know
about the payment?
Yes.
Trump initially
pleaded ignorance.
“Mr. President,
did you know about
the $130,000 payment
to Stormy Daniels?”
“No.”
Giuliani then
changed the story:
“But he did know about
the general arrangement
that Michael would take
care of things like this.”
Trump now acknowledges
the payment too.
When did he learn about
the payment? Unclear.
Giuliani has gone back
and forth on his timeline.
“A couple weeks ago —
maybe not even a couple,
maybe 10 days ago.”
“It could have been recently, 
it could have been a while back.”
But Trump may have
known months ago,
sources told
The New York Times.
When was Daniels paid off?
October 2016.
Giuliani says the payment was
made right before the election.
“Imagine if that came out
on Oct. 15, 2016,
in the middle of
the last debate?”
“Cohen made it go away.
He did his job.”
Why does the timing matter?
If it was election-related,
it may have violated
campaign finance law.
Giuliani says the details
don’t matter because,
according to him,
no laws were broken.
“It was not a
campaign contribution
because it would have
been done anyway.”
“It’s not campaign money.
No campaign finance violation.”
But we still don’t
know the full story.
Are Giuliani and Trump
on the same page?
Unclear.
Giuliani says yes. 
Trump says no.
“Rudy is a great guy,
but he just started a day ago.”
“He’ll get his facts straight.
He’s a great guy.
But what he does is
he feels it’s a very bad thing
for our country
and he happens to be right.”
