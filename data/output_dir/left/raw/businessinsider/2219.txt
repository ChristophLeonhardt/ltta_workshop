better in<font color="#CCCCCC"> every conceivable way this</font>

time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Nexus 7 is a bit slimmer and</font>

lighter has a narrow side bezel and a

Apple's iPad Mini and that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,369
makes the nexus 7 stand out from a

10

hardware perspective it's much better

resolution of any display on a 7-inch

15
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,999
tablet and that makes all the difference

16
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,460
when gaming reading text or watching

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,069
video design-wise the nexus 7 feels slim

18
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,019
and has a nice rubbery feel on the back

19
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:48,179
but I'm not too crazy about the wide

bezels at the top and bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

feel bit out of proportion still it's

23
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:56,789
easy enough to hold in one hand because

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,739
it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> android tablet the Nexus 7 has</font>

one major drawback most<font color="#E5E5E5"> android apps</font>
