find that question to Democrats that number Falls to less than a third less than a third under one and three Democrats are extremely proud to be Americans now I know there were similar polls taken during the Obama era Republicans still said they were proud to be American they just didn't like President Obama Democrats tend to believe that the leadership of the country is reflective of the country itself so when there's the president that they like like Barack Obama then they're very proud of their country and when there's president they don't like like George aid should like george w bush or like donald trump then they are not so fond of our country they're not extremely proud of their country I'm proud of my country having nothing nothing to do with who the president is because my country is not the president my country is not the people who currently constitute the government my country is the country based on the Declaration of Independence in the Constitution and the philosophy that underlies that my country is the country with a shared common history and a shared common value right that's that's the country that I care about and if you don't see America as a set of eternal principles and values that outlive any single president or any single legislature or any single Speaker of the House or any single Supreme Court justice I would suggest that you don't have a valuable view of America in and of itself you just think of America as what it is today as opposed to America as a manifestation of the of certain ideals and maybe those ideals are being imperfectly implemented but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be proud of the ideals themselves or the history of America which has freed more people from tyranny than any country in the history of the globe Republicans have consistently said they are extremely proud to be American had a significantly higher rate than Democrats according to media I the this new number that less than half of all Americans are extremely proud to be American this is a new low since the question was first poll by Gallup in 2003 overall 47% of US adults are extremely proud among Democrats at numbers 32% Republicans have said they are extremely proud much more consistently than Democrats because Republicans are much more tied to foundational documents and to the system created by the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence also Republicans are more likely to engage in displays of patriotism there are a lot of good studies that suggest that if you take your kid to a 4th of July parade that in and of itself is a good predictor as to whether your kid will vote Republican or Democrat because if you feel there is inherent importance to the idea of America and to the symbolism of America you're more likely to be Republican or as if you think of yourself as a global citizen as a person who's above and beyond these American ideals you're a person who can stand outside America and cast a keen eye at the problems in America faces you're more likely to be a Democrat the number dipped slightly to 68% of Republicans saying they were extremely proud to be American in 2016 but it's now 74 percent Democrats conversely said they were extremely proud irate of 46 percent in 2016 but in two years that number has dropped by fourteen points and that's obvious why that's because Republicans now dominate public politics so as Republicans have continued to dominate electoral Democrats have become unless proud of their country because again Democrats think of America as the government they don't think of it as the American people or the values embodied by the American people or the founding values which they don't like anyway Democrats believe that the founding values merely enshrined racism sexism bigotry and homophobia that all of the Constitution all of the Declaration of Independence was written as a way to enshrine property ownership by rich white men this is the Howard Zinn view of history and unfortunately it's permeated a large segments of the Democratic Party it's a real problem for Democrats it really is because most Americans generally despite this poll most Americans still kind of like the country and when you have this Howard Zinn view of history that George Washington was just a rich white slave-owner who had no principles and then he wasn't risking anything in the Revolutionary where all these guys just wanted to keep their own property when you believe that you throw out American history when you treat American history is just a series of power relations what you're really doing is undermining what America is and what makes America good the reality is that America is the only country in human history founded on an ideal a stated ideal and a good ideal the idea that all men are created equal granted inalienable rights by their creator a that is a unique proposition in human history and the founding fathers may not have perfectly realized the manifestation of that idea right slavery still existed obviously many of the same people who signed the Declaration of Independence the guy who wrote the Declaration of Independence was a slave holder but it doesn't mean that the ideal that they were promoting wasn't a good ideal it was a great ideal it is a great ideal and that's why I've always objected to the folks who kneel during the national anthem I've always objected to this idea that you have to burn the flag in order to protest it seems to me the way you really should be doing is saying I love the flag and that's why I think that we're not standing up in proper ways for it I love the national anthem I love the country and that's why I think that we have to fulfill that dream this is what Frederick Douglass did so well he did a very famous speech during the the late days of slavery before the Civil War he did a speech very famous fourth of July speech in which he said the Declaration of Independence is magnificent document but it doesn't protect people like me it should protect people like me it should be universal let's look at the universal implications of the ideas pushed by Thomas Jefferson and then let's go out and act upon them right that's the way that people ought to question whether we're living up to our own ideals the ideal themselves are good and this this Marxist idea that all politics all principle is really just a manifestation of what you want it's all just power relationships that the only reason that the Constitution exists is because they're a bunch of people who want to preserve their own interests it's just not correct it's just not correct it was a lot riskier for the founders to fight against the greatest empire on earth than it was for them it was much riskier for them to fight that that Empire and put all their property at risk I mean the Declaration of Independence pledges their lives they're there their wealth and their sacred honor their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to the fight there are their founders who won't legitimately broke in the course of the Revolutionary War robert Livingston among them from New York he watched his house burned to the ground that George Washington there's there's a story of my business partner german-born was telling me last night hey George Washington the the British were threatening Mount Vernon and apparently one of his one of his staffers basically went out and begged the British not to burn down Mount Vernon when Washington found out about who's angry he said listen I pledged my life my fortune my sacred honor to fight this battle to pretend that the heroes of America's past are not actually heroes is deeply embedded in a lot of democratic ideology right now and it's really bad it means that there's no commonality you want to know why the country is breaking apart because we don't have a common mythology we don't have a common set of values we don't have a common concept of Liberty even the things that you see unites us divide us go back to 1950 and listen to how Democrats talked about the Declaration of Independence look at the speeches and the writings of Arthur Schlessinger and who is considered your the great intellectual of the Democratic Party look at the speeches of JFK there's a lot of patriotism to Democrats in the nineteen twenties thirties forties fifties sixties then in the sixties it broke and the sixties it was decided that America was actually a bad place and that all of the evils that were obvious in American life were simply parts of a greater horrible hierarchy that they were effects of this terrible American hierarchy that the reason that there was racism the reason there was Jim Crow the reason there was this war in Vietnam it was all because America had been built on the wrong basis if it had been built on the basis of redistributionist Marxism with social ownership of the means of production then everything would have been so much better and the left has never gotten over this so according to this report from Gallup politics appears to be a factor in and why so many people are not proud to be American with sharp declines evidence among Democrats and political liberals and no decrease among Republicans and conservatives but that's the point right the the point here is not that Democrats dropped their support for the United States because it from what's in what's actually kind of interesting is that Republicans support for the United States or enthusiasm about the United States only rose like a little bit in single digits in other words Republicans are very much tied to these these generalized ideals and Democrats see these generalized ideals are as bad unless they have a president in office who's fighting against those generalized ideals the report says left-leaning group's antipathy toward Trump and their belief that other countries look unfavorably on the president are likely factors in their decline in patriotism particularly the sharp drops in the last year but again I point out the fact that I'm only a minority of Democrats said they were extremely proud to be American even when Barack Obama was president what's it that's a shocking statistic it's a shocking statistic I think there's there something else happening too and that is that there are a number of people who are just not appreciative of living in America because they have it so good see it's everyone who's trying to get into America realizes that America is a great place everybody was trying to get in illegally or legally who's trying to cross that border is trying to get here because it's better here people around the world are trying to imitate the implementation of American markets and American constitutional ideas because they see that America is a powerhouse and they look at their own lives and they say our own life isn't that great maybe our life could be better if we started implementing some of those ideals and in fact when you implement those ideals your country becomes better when you implement free market ideas on a rock like Hong Kong you turn Hong Kong into a thriving place when you implement terrible ideas in an apparent area then you end up in poverty so one of the things that's important to note here is that we are all living better in the United States and generally around the world than we ever have Bill Gates is right he's the obviously Microsoft co-founder and he's praised the republican-led Congress for rejecting the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the State Department budget according to PJ Media Gates pointed out that the foreign aid budget nearly doubled during President George HW Bush's tenure but here's the point that he makes and this is this is the one that I think actually matters he says that the world is better now than it ever has been it's not really about how much we spent on foreign aid this is where he's wrong but he says that the world is a far better place than it ever has been in history and that is essentially true I mean materially that is certainly true he says by almost any metric the world is a far better place today less violent deaths less disease more education than ever in its history it doesn't mean that we can feel complacent about that remaining burden he noted that in that in 1990 12 million kids under five years old died that figures now less than 5 million per year the world he said is a hundred times less violent than it was a thousand years ago that is the percentage of deaths that are violent is down dramatically so attitudes have shifted obviously the world is a better place and I would suggest the reason the world's a better place is because of murica the reason the world is a better place is because of the United States in a second I'm going to talk about that a little bit more first I want to say thanks to the u.s. ECA so one of the things that the United States is always enshrined is the Second Amendment and as we approach 4th of July it's important to remember that one of the reasons that we have our freedoms is because American citizens owned guns and you should own a gun too if you're a law-abiding citizen you should protect your family and your community in your country with those weapons so like me the u.s. EC it believes the right to defend your loved ones with a gun is a god-given freedom and in honor of the 4th of July the US ECA is celebrating our forefathers and our Second Amendment freedom with the great American giveaway five lucky winners will each receive 1776 bucks to purchase the gun and ammo of their choice it's really easy just go to defend your family now calm for your free entry and

calm ok so Bill Gates says the worlds apart better place today and then he doesn't really talk about why he says that it must be because of the US State Department that's not why the world is a better place the world is a better place because the rest of the world has embraced America's visions of markets because the rest of the world has engaged with the United States in an exchange of free labor because the rest of the world has decided that America had it right in the first place America has been the Atlas holding up the world since World War two it's virtually all global growth has occurred on the back of the United States there are a lot of people on the Left who believe that if the United States were to disappear or foot were to go european-style redistributionist or if they were to go socialist then nothing in the world would really change well they neglect to mention is the fact that the world the engine for growth is the United States that is the engine of growth in virtually every part of the globe we are the chief trading partners with a huge number of countries for a reason we're not just the big of market the biggest market or the biggest producers the United States is a global engine of growth not just because of free markets but because of the values embedded in free markets the idea that you own your own labor the idea that you have a duty and a responsibility to go out and work hey these are American ideas embedded in the Declaration of Independence embedded in the Constitution of the United States this is all stuff we should be proud of when we look at the world you know there's there's a tendency by even some on the right to look at the world we say well you know America hasn't seen the gains that it should have seen over the past thirty years which I think is utter nonsense if you look at the standard of living in the United States the stuff that you can have now versus what you could have thirty years ago you would significantly rather live now than then live in 1980 but if you've got to be born when I was born or be born now you'd rather be born now it's just a reality and I'm only 34 the world has gotten to be a better place since then but even if you believe that even if you believe that the United States has it has not grown the way that it should and then you look at global growth and you say well look at all these other countries that are growing so fast that's due to American power that's due to the fact that America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world so if you're a leftist and you don't actually believe that a stronger America is necessary look at the rest of the world where we have half to the extreme poverty rate in less than 40 years and think to yourself maybe that's because the ideas that created the United States were the best ideas that anybody ever had for founding a country and if you don't believe that I think that you're going to get America wrong you're not gonna be patriotic and you're not going understand why it is that America is is great in the first place it's not just that we have to make America great again it's that we have to understand why America was great in the first place so that we can make America great again okay meanwhile speaking of making America great again the presidents of the United States is moving steadily toward picking his Supreme Court nominee right now they are saying that the the person in the lead is Judge Cavanaugh from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals I've said that I am rather skeptical of judge Cavanaugh I don't think that he's going to be justice Kennedy I don't think he's going to be somebody who veers wildly left but I certainly think that there's a possibility he could be judge Justice Roberts Chief Justice Roberts the reason I say this is there a couple of cases in which he ruled in shall we say too clever by half fashion so he's a brilliant guy Cavanaugh there's no question I mean look at his writing he's a great writer very very smart legal theorist but one of the problems I see is that there are two types of votes on the Supreme Court there's the Clarence Thomas kind of vote on the Supreme Court which is I will vote the way that I think is correct in every possible case and I'm not going to try to pretend that I'm currying favor or cultivating votes among other members of the court I'm not interested in the cohesiveness Oh Court of gore coherence or the or these sort of collegiality of the court I'm more interested in just voting the right way and saying what's true which is Clarence Thomas's approach and then there's Roberts's approach which is I'm going to try to cobble together majorities now sometimes you need to cobble together majorities on crucial cases but Roberts has a tendency to do that by sacrificing principles so I think most recently there's a case in this term with regard to masterpiece cake shop in which there were certainly five votes certainly five votes to say that laws that tell religious people that they have to cater same-sex weddings are discriminatory against religious people and instead Roberts decided I'm going to cobble together a seven two opinion that is decided on very narrow grounds where maybe those laws aren't unconstitutional it's just that they have to be implemented in the most neutral possible way and that to me is a mistake I think Kavanagh is more along the lines of Roberts it seems to me that he's somebody who's trying to heat rise to do some consensus-building there's a there's one particular there are a couple particular cases for for a Kavanagh that are sort of troubling again if he's if he's nominated he will be confirmed it's it but he but the case the one that that is that is most troubling is seven skies there's a case called seven sky this is known about the Obamacare case and in that case he didn't go along with with the opinion that Obamacare itself was unconstitutional instead what he said is I'm not going to rule on whether Obamacare is unconstitutional because under the anti-injunction Act I'm not allowed to rule on whether Obamacare is unconstitutional because basically the penalty under Obamacare is applied as attach and and be because the anti-injunction Act is sort of specifically worded I therefore I can't reach the jurisdictional question yeah that logic that this was a tax and not a penalty ended up being used by Chief Justice Roberts and by the Obama administration in their arguments before the Supreme Court that ended with Chief Justice Roberts essentially green-lighting Obamacare also there there have been some complaints that that Cavanaugh has been providing some of his clerks to liberal justices at the Supreme Court and there's more crossover appeal to Cavanaugh for sure with other leftist members of the court then there are a couple of other cases that people are talking about one is called priests for life another is called Garza the both both cases are I would say at least slightly troubling none of this is to say the Kavanagh is is going to be again a wild liberal but it is to say that he has a tendency to be too clever in his rulings at least on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals so it's some you know I'm I'm not in love with this I'm just I'm not in love with the Cavanaugh Peck I'm not gonna pretend I'm supremely enthusiastic about the Cavanaugh Peck I don't think that it is it is going to again do I do I think it's gonna be the worst thing in the world no but I also think that it's gonna fall well in line with the with the generalized mainstream Republican opinion now that we shouldn't overturn roe v wade I don't think the Cavanaugh will be a vote overturn Roe hey just my speculation I don't think he will I think a me koni Barrett well the other possibility that Trump is considering that will be and here's why I think this case of Leonard Leo who's the head of the Federalist Society which is a great group I was a member in law school Leonard Leo he came forward he said listen we're probably not going to overturn Roe okay this is the guy who is the strongest advocate for Cavanaugh right now he's the guy really pushing for Cavanaugh and he's saying we're not gonna overturn roe v wade which by the way ought to be overturned okay I'm saying it's straight out of course it ought to be overturn to take garbage to say it is a bad legal decision it is a bad moral decision it has nothing to it the Constitution but Leonard Leo the guy who's actually helping Trump select the Supreme Court pick is saying openly he doesn't think that roe v wade is gonna be able to turn you know he's never asked this question of a nominee we've never discussed it and right now there's only one justice on the court Clarence Thomas who is said explicitly he wants to overturn Roe so there's a lot of speculation going on here and I'm just very skeptical about you know what people are suggesting might happen so you know if you're getting that from Leonard Leo then I would think that that's probably the way that it's gonna go it's it's worth noting by the way that he was instrumental Cavanaugh was when he was working with the Bush administration and helping to push Chief Justice Roberts on to the Supreme Court in the first place now I understand there's a tendency to try and you know make people feel a little bit more sanguine about whatever Supreme Court pick happens here but this is not a time to make people feel sanguine just go for broke just go for the guy you want go for the woman you want go for the person you want who's going to rule the right way on these cases why I've been suggesting Mike Lee all the way I know that Mike Lee is going to vote the right way on these cases because I have discussed constitutional jurisprudence with Mike Lee because I know where Mike Lee stands on key issues I don't know why you would possibly risk it with a mystery justice who may or may not vote the way that you want on these issues and this is one of those areas where I think that it's it's too bad that President Trump doesn't take a higher level of interest I think that he's farming it out too when a Leonard Leo and Don McGann his White House Counsel I just don't see that as a particularly strong move okay in just a second I want to talk about Alan Dershowitz and and incivility first I want to say

attacking folks on the right there's a couple of stories that are really bad out today apparently there's a man who's now been arrested after threatening to kill Rand Paul and his family with an axe so things are going really well around Paul of course last year was badly injured when his neighbor tackled him over a matter of politics supposedly so Senator Paul said the man had threatened to kill me and chop up my family with an axe it's just horrendous that we're having to deal with things like this now do I think by the way that you know this is regular Democrat my guess is probably not so I think that the guy who shot the Congressional baseball game was a regular Democrat I don't think so I don't think there's any indicator that that was the case but there is no question that the Democrats are deliberately raising the temperature in the country and they're treating people as heroes for confronting other people in public right not by protesting now by making an appointment for discussion not by speaking out but by harassing people in public so this is the most polite harassment that I've seen and still it's not I think a very good precedent Scott Pruett was at a restaurant the EPA Chief Scott produce at a restaurant and a woman comes up with her child and decides to lecture him on why he should resign every night my son okay you know I'm not sure why this is a good thing so people are treating this is like this is a great thing she's confronting Scott Pruett in public I'm not sure why not sure why like do I think it's the end of the world I don't you know I've had discussions with people on politics in public before but do I think that it's good for the country that this sort of thing is happening on a more regular basis not particularly cuz I don't think that this woman is interested in engaged engaging in discussion I think that the reason there's a camera on her right now is because she wants a viral video of her telling off Scott Pruett and that's what we've become or a country of people who want videos of ourselves telling people off and and none of this is particularly good now there's a lot of people today who are making fun of alan dershowitz Oh Alan Dershowitz I had him when he had Dersch when I was at Harvard Law School and dersh is a Democrat right he's been a lifelong Democrat he voted for Barack Obama I believe twice and now he has been somewhat friendly to president Trump's to president from sort of legal strategy and he's written a piece about why it is that so many people on the Left are now sort of excising him from their lives here's what he writes and he's getting made fun up for this he writes congresswoman Maxine Waters recently told her supporters to hound president Trump's cabinet members wherever they find them they're not gonna be able to go to a restaurant they're not gonna be able to stop at a gas station they're not gonna be able to shop at a department store the people are gonna turn on them they're gonna protest they're gonna absolutely harass them waters does not speak for all Democrats or liberals nor do those who through Sarah Huckabee Sanders out of a red hen restaurant neither do those who have harassed other members of the Trump administration but these rude extremists are a symptom of the times the divisions have gotten so bad that many on both sides refused to speak or listen to people on the other side either you're for Trump or against him and that is all some people need to know to make judgments about you now obviously I think that logic has permeated every side right you're either for Trump or you're against him when I was on Bill Maher he said that right to start the interview he said you know these days you're either a Republican or a Democrat I'm a Democrat when he said that I was on Team treason which is just demonstrative of the fact that he knows number one nothing about me and number two of the of the polarization in our politics desertion which is right about that and then he gets into his personal experience and this is where he's getting mocked he says I know this because I've experienced this firsthand on Martha's Vineyard I'm not a trump supporter nor am i member of the Trump administration I strongly and publicly opposed his immigration policies ranging from the travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court to the zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of parents and children at the border I opposed other Republican policies as well I voted for and contributed handsomely to Hillary Clinton but I've defended Trump's civil liberties along with those of all Americans just as I would have defended Hillary Clinton's civil liberties had she been elected and subjected to efforts of impeachment or prosecution and then he says I'm a liberal Democrat in politics but a neutral Civic libertarian when it comes to the Constitution but that is not good enough for some of my old friends and Martha's Vineyard says says Alan Dershowitz is for them it is enough that what I have said about the Constitution might help Trump so they are shunning me and trying to ban me from their social life on Martha's Vineyard one of them an academic and a distinguished university has told people he would not attend any dinner or party to which I was invited he and others have demanded trigger warnings so they can be assured of having safe spaces in which they will not encounter me or my ideas others have said they will discontinue contributions to organizations that sponsor my talks this is all familiar to me since I lived through McCarthyism in the 1950s when lawyers who represented alleged communists on civil libertarian grounds were shown some of those lawyers and victims of McCarthyism lived on Martha's Vineyard I never thought I'd see McCarthyism come to Martha's Vineyard but I have I wonder if the professor who refuses to listen to anything I have to say also treats a student similarly what he listened to a student who actively supported Trump what about one who simply supported a civil liberties okay so people are making fun of him because Martha's Vineyard is very wealthy and if true if Dershowitz is getting shunned on Martha's Vineyard Oh play the world's smallest violin and sort of how the logic goes but I'd like to point out the counter logic of left so the left itself has said that it is a refusal of human dignity it is a refusal of human dignity for me and my synagogue not to perform your same-sex wedding right it is a violation of your personal dignity for me personally not to approve of your behavior in any way not just with regard to sex with regard to anything for me to withhold my approval of you is a denial of your self-esteem and it's a it's an imposition on your life and then the same people will mock Alan Dershowitz for saying listen I used to be able to invited all these dinner parties I said that Trump has civil rights and now I'm not invited dinner parties the point that Dershowitz is making is not that he's seeing some sort of brutal government crackdown the point that he's making and I think it's well taken is that intolerance in our nation has reached a supreme extreme where nobody is even listening to one another anymore he'd prefer for these utopian schemes to play out one way or the other so there's particularly trauma left where they believe that Donald Trump is going to be removed from office through a deus ex machina there's going to be something that happens the ghosts outside there will be a god outside the Machine who will intervene stick his hand in and trumple no longer be President and if you don't believe that well you don't belong in our religious clique and he's not wrong about that Dershowitz when he says this wenzer true it says that he's being excised the only thing that he's wrong about is that this is something new this isn't new at all this was happening during the Bush administration every Republican that I know when they go to a Thanksgiving dinner he's shunned by their Democratic relatives I know very few Republicans who have actually shunned their Democratic relatives when they come over for dinner there's a reason that conservatives avoid bringing up politics when they're in the context of their of their family events whereas Democrats have no problem doing it whatsoever people on the Left are constantly bringing up politics and family dinners because they understand that conservatives tend to be more tolerant polls show this by the way the conservatives tend to interact more with people on the Left than people on the Left tend to act interact with conservatives but then the mockery of Alan Dershowitz that oh he's rich and oh he's Jewish you know he teaches at Harvard Law therefore why is he complaining about how people treat him this is coming from the same people who whine non-stop about how they are treated by people to whom they have no right to affection and it's it's mind-boggling Lee mind-bogglingly hypocritical but perfectly within line with how the left thinks which is that they have all these rights from you but you have no rights from them the answer is we none of us have a right to love from from anybody right none of us have that but we all do have I think an obligation to civility an obligation of civility and that is going by the wayside in pretty obvious fashion so in just a second I want to talk about that political divide a little bit more first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at Birch

conservative podcast in the nation so the extremism of the left is on full display the reason they feel fully justified in treating people badly is because they feel that you are an inferior human being and again I don't think there's anything new I think that that Alan Dershowitz has just been mugged by reality when he complains about this stuff I don't think that anything has changed I really don't think anything has changed so I'll take for an example joss whedon so joss whedon has been a nut for a long time and now joss whedon tweets out this today hey far-right gonna beat you not gonna start a war not gonna shoot you run you over threatened your kids gonna beat you with passionate compassion with journalism activism the law with votes your rage is fear our rage is love our state is united happy fourth it's that last it's that second to last line that really is telling like I'm glad that he's not gonna start a war by the way if people on the Left tried to start a war with people on the right they should think about who has all the guns in the country right now but that second last line they're our rage is love your rage is fear our rage is love no your age is not love your rage is rage your rage is rage and I think that we live in an era of politics where anger is seen as authenticity that if you are not rageful if you are not screaming at the moon if you're not baying like a hound to people then that means that you're not passionate enough we can automatically throw out your opinion it means you're not authentic the most authentic politicians are the ones who yell and scream at people those are the ones that we really should follow all the way down the primrose path those are the people we also engage with the left believes this right the left believes that they did not fight hard to get hard enough against President Trump that Hillary Clinton was too civil to President Trump and that's why they need to go yell at people in restaurants that's why they need to attack people at gas stations that's letting the mob people because if they do that then maybe these Republicans will be taught their lesson that's not how any of this works you want to convince people must vote for President Trump who voted for him last time you need to stop calling them racist you're gonna need to stop threatening their families you're gonna need to stop with the are rages fear routine our rage is love routine your rage is not love your rage is clearly fear your rage is obviously fear this is not righteous indignation this is this is just anger it's just pure I'll anger directed at the president and directed at the president supporters and the reason you can tell this is because of the disproportionate response to everything Trump does if they were just angry when Trump does something wrong then maybe I'd get it right if they just got angry over Charlottesville and I'd say okay but that's not the day that's not the deal every time Trump does anything they lose their minds any time he performs any constitutional function they suggest that it's legitimately the end of the world that we're watching right now is a breakdown in real-time who we are watching the the apocalyptic politics that are going to end the country and I just don't understand it I just don't understand why anybody would look at America right now and think that we're living in an apocalypse we're legitimately living in heaven if you were born and not if you if you were transported from 1920 you ripped down Winkley go to sleep in let's say 19 1920 let's pick 1917 is the middle of World War one okay and two years aways the influenza epidemic the your ways an influenza epidemic that's gonna kill legitimately hundreds of thousands of people across the world and you're living in 1919 17 1918 and you go to sleep and you wake up and it's 2018 we fast forward a hundred years and it's 2018 you would think you had died and gone to heaven you would you would think you were dead and you'd gone to heaven that you died in the influenza epidemic and now you were in heaven that's how good things are right now okay the fact it not for everybody obviously they're suffering obvious there are people having a tough time but the average citizen of the United States has a car a microwave central air-conditioning a piece of hardware that they carry around in their hand that has more computing power than NASA had when they sent somebody to the moon okay the in walking around with instant access to information and entertainment have to go to a movie theater anymore and drop money at a movie theater instead you've got this information that's available to you at every moment of the day you you can court you can FaceTime with your kids when you're 3,000 miles away and and not just that the levels of violence in American society are at record lows they're not at record highs okay then we had a murder epidemic that took place basically from 1960 to 1994 and started dropping then and it's continued to drop okay but you can live in your neighborhood depending on your neighborhood the most most neighborhoods in the United States you go to sleep at night and you're not deeply worried that somebody's gonna break in your house and murder you or they your house is gonna get burned down or there's gonna be a riot outside hey that's think about the progression in New York City alone New York City was one of the most violent places in America New York City is now one of the safest places in America America has has made heaven a reality at least in so far as anyone in the past would have thought and we are looking at it we are seeing a hell and maybe that's because we've got the wrong frame of mind that's because we're not comparing ourselves to the past we're not even comparing ourselves to what we could be we are comparing ourselves to utopia that doesn't exist but only exists in your mind and we're comparing ourselves to a political system that has never been in tried that has never been that has never been really attempted without leaving a lot of people dead and we're comparing ourselves to this phantom that doesn't exist in reality and then we're declaring that we have come up short I mean that that's that the only way I can explain this anger because anger it seems to me is coming out of frustration and the only reason the Democrats would be frustrated in a world where same-sex marriage is legal abortion on demand is legal and they've got everything they want in terms of state intervention in a social safety net basically they're looking around they're saying this is hell this is hell maybe it's just that they were so used to being on top for so long that when when the American people said hold up a sec let's throw the brakes on and let's appreciate what's happened in the United States and maybe let's maybe let's think about whether we've gone too far in some areas that they were so panicked about that they saw utopia is something lost another frustrated and angry whatever it is it's delusional and that delusion is leading to a psychic break among a lot of hardcore Democrats that is going to lead the country in in worse and worse directions okay meanwhile I want to talk to you about this really funny study so one of the things that I think is really funny is that the left is insistent that science is not a thing really there are a lot of folks on the Left who believe that real science is a manifestation of the patriarchy and that biological differences are really not biological differences particularly between men and women they are oh they are all socially constructed so the left wants to hold that gender identity is fully biological that if you're a man who believes you are a woman that is fully biological and there is no active choice involved whatsoever but it's also socially constructed gender it's how gender is socially constructed but your gender identity is biological if you can square that circle then congratulations to you because you are a you are either incredibly stupid or incredibly smart because that makes no sense at all but it turns out that biology has some things to say about differences between the sexes and those don't always cut in favor of feminist notions about the differences between the sexes so there's a study that the Daily Mail reports on today say women are more attracted to men who are sexist because they think they are more willing to protect them provide for them and commit to a relationship scientists say so poor poor feminists men who think that they were going to think that they were going to get some because they were because they were wearing the I am a feminist t-shirt it turns out that you are less that you are less prone to to be the the obvious victors in natural selection than the guy who just says men are men women are women and men's job is to defend women you know why women kind of like that because women think that men's job is to defend women even women who believe that men's job is not to defend women believe that men's job is to defend women all the same feminists in the meets you movement who think the men are predators then yell at men who didn't do enough to protect women not men who are rapists men who didn't protect women enough why because they understand there's a social obligation that is real a moral obligation for men to defend women in a stronger way than men defend men men don't defend men as strongly as men defend women just a reality and women like that oops so it says men who are considered to be sexist in a well-meaning way for example if they're chivalrous or think women need a man to protect them maybe more attractive even though women find these men patronizing and can feel undermined by them they're more likely to want to couple up with them than with men who don't give them special treatment right feminists still want men to pick up the bill when they go to coffee researchers say women may be hardwired to think the benefits of being with a kind but sexist man outweigh the downsides the scientists maintain that despite romantic and flattering elements of the relationship even well-meaning sexism reinforces the idea that women are inferior okay this is the part of the study that's done it really if women really believe that man opening a door for them means that they are inferior that's because women have a complex that cannot be cured by a change in men's social status a I don't know a secure woman on earth and feels terrible that a man opened a door for them it says even women who consider themselves strong feminists show the same preferences in the study by British and US researchers so it's not internalized misogyny ladies okay it you can be as feminist as you want to be and it turns out you still want to do it he's going to protect and defend a family you know why because women are built to have kids with men and men are built to have kids with and women are built to need protection by men from other men hey this is this is not just among human beings okay this is true among the chimpanzees the reality is that dominant males are not just physically dominant they are also protective of their brood scientists from the University of Kent and Iowa State University carried out five tests to explore the theory that women are more attracted to what they call benevolent sexist benevolent means well-meaning are kind experts to find the sexism as men who for example think women are more delicate or should be cherished or looked after by a man okay I don't know why that sexist women are more physically delicate as a general as a general sort that is a biological truth women are more physically delicate on average that doesn't mean that I am that I am less physically delicate than Serena Williams okay Serena Williams could beat the crap out of me but the reality is that on average men are stronger than women women are more physically delicate than men duh sorry to break it okay and also that women why is it sexist to say women should be cherished what I'm just confused would you rather I said women shouldn't be cherished and I guess we just treat women like the garbage I treated all my male friends like men treat each other like crap are you kidding like you've ever been in a group of men all they do is sock each other in the nuts and talk crash trash to each other like that's really what guys do it seems to me that women should be pretty happy that men and cherish them but and that's not sexist that's because women should be cherished because women are more special than men and they do require a certain level of protection they say that sexist attitudes were the norm for decades this is shifted in recent years but heterosexual women's preferences for partners may not be moving on as quickly why because it's embedded in biology the researchers test found women are more attracted to men who have benevolent sexist attitudes and actions and they are the men who treat them as equals or don't give them special treatment so this is really really funny so even even feminists are by the way it says that women are also attracted to get ready for it popularity money muscles and intelligence oh you mean like the basics of natural selections still hold for human women I can't believe it but I guess we're all supposed to pretend that all this is a social construct that really what what men want is a soy soy drinking pajama boy who sits in his mother's basement all day and reads feminist literature that's that that's what that's what women are really looking for yeah well good luck with that dudes really solid luck with that okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things I like today so let's do let's do a movie so a quiet place this is a movie with John Krasinski who's in and directed by John Krasinski as well with Emily Blunt John Krasinski is very good in the movie Emily Blunt is terrific because she's really a she's a first-rate actress you know when I think of actresses who are the best working today I think Emily Blunt is probably the best actress working today I think she's better than Natalie Portman I think that she is it's like significantly better than Natalie Portman who I think is wildly overrated I think she's better than Kate Winslet who I really do like as an actress Emily Blunt is just terrific this is a very kind of small horror film it was it's only about an hour and a half long which is how long movies should be and yet I see you're saying Amy Adams but no I think I would prefer Emily Blunt I do like Amy Adams as an actress she's very versatile but Emily Blunt is a better actress I think but this is a movie the basic premise of it it's what they call a high concept horror film so the basic premise of it is that these aliens invade earth we don't know how they got here or what they've done to the rest of humanity but they are blindness they can't see anything but they can hear pretty much everything so if you make noise then they will hunt you down so it's about this family that sort of lives on a farm and the one of the kids has hearing difficulty so all the people can speak sign language this obviously helps protect them against the aliens it's it's really atmospheric and really creepy but it's also quite meaningful pro-life and ProGuard so I mean I doubt that they meant this when they wrote the film but it is a pro-life pro-gun film and one of the basic issues is that as this is happening you know and you're not allowed to make noise the Emily Blunt who's the wife in the film is pregnant and there's never a thought about like should she have the baby or not she's going to have the baby well babies make a lot of noise and so obviously this is a serious issue for the film so here's a little bit of the preview like they pray before meals like it it's a really conservative film yeah there's not a lot of talking because the movie doesn't have a lot of dialogue like what what it's the yeah it's never never make a sound as sort of a sort of the slogan it the movie begins with just this horrifying scene I mean it's in the preview um it's the first three minutes of the film this is horrifying scene where one of the kids make some noise and an alien basically kills the kid it's it's really really upsetting but unlike other horror films that sort of treat you know the death of children is almost a fun aspect of the horror film like it's treated with actual sensitivity it's treated as a real you know a real thing that tears the family apart it's a very good movie it's a very good movie like I'm very impressed it made a ton of money at the box office um and I think one of the reasons that it made a ton money of the box office is twofold one horror films right now are doing hot hot stuff the box office because to experience a horror film in in a communal setting is very different from watching it individually so when you watch it on your phone you watch it at home it's not quite as scary you watch it in a theater with a bunch of people who are reacting the same way that you're reacting comedies and horror films are gonna do better at the box office big action flicks that have you know obviously you require a big screen for them is a different thing but I think horror films are doing huge business because it still requires sort of a communal feeling them but beyond that the movie did really well because the movie is tightly constructed okay the movie is not a wasted it's not wasted space and also it doesn't it doesn't make some it doesn't make some political actor the bad guy it's really more about the solidity of the family itself and the family unit the importance of the family in a really good movie go check it out a quiet place John Krasinski who directed it and did he write it as well he I'm not sure but he's the star of it with his what his actual real-life wife Emily one okay time for a thing that I hate so Starbucks will never be left alone ever Starbucks will never be left alone so now that they supposedly borrowed a black guy from a bathroom in Philadelphia a story which I still have significant doubts about because again there are many cameras in that Starbucks the person behind the counter the barista who is supposedly the evil racist turns out to be an sjw you know woman in any case they've now shut down their restaurant for three hours to retrain everybody in implicit bias which is a bunch of crap anyway now Starbucks advisers say that the company's anti racial bias training in response to the arrest of two black men in a store in Philadelphia is not enough according to Z C McAlister over at the Daily wire they're proposing a civil rights audit of the company to make equity its number-one concern so former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz contacted Heather McGee of the Equality advocacy group group demos and Sheeran fo eyeful of the n-double a-c-p legal defense and education fund after the arrest in May for advice always a mistake because they returned with advice and what is the advice the advice is spend a lot of money on us right they want a top-to-bottom civil rights audit because Starbucks when I think Jim Crow I think Starbucks when I think Bull Connor I think that barista behind the counter with seven earrings three tattoos and a gender binary and a gender non-binary identity I think that that person is the is the new that is the new avid that that's George Wallace back there I know and I see that person I think man that's it that's personally sick dogs on black people if that person could get a chance if that if that non gender binary bisexual pansexual tattooed hasn't held a job except for being a barista among diverse peoples that that person that's the guy I'm really afraid of that guys John C Calhoun back there so here they say they say that this this should include a top to bottom civil rights audit more resources for employees encountering customers with mental health and addiction problems and the creation of a customer Bill of Rights to be posted at each store a customer Bill of Rights you have the right to be the right to be served as the customer as the as the restaurant wishes to serve you you do not have a customer Bill of Rights that's always you have a customer Bill of Rights is so stupid you have a market choice when you have a market choice you don't have a customer Bill of Rights a Bill of Rights is necessary against the government because the government can actually impede on your rights you don't have a right - anything from the restaurant if you walk in and you say I have a right to your food the restaurant rightly would say no you don't you didn't pay for that food but the idea that you have rights against other American citizens when it comes to their private business transactions is just inane they say that they they found some improvements these people than in the Starbucks understanding of the nature of unconscious bias but they decided that they need a more rigorous evaluation so I guess that we're going to actually put all the Starbucks baristas in rooms like clockwork orange' gonna pry their eyes open with the with the with the metal thingies and then we're going to make them watch over and over 12 years of slave until they understand that slavery has to do with coffee or something and then and says that the policy manuals need to be overhauled to prioritize equality throughout the company culture and clearly direct employees on managing customer relations including how to respond to incidences of discrimination bias and harassment and then this is the problem you know what Starbucks deserves this okay they had this coming so I don't hate it that much because Starbucks decided they were going to dip a toe into the pool of the sjw's and now they're going to they're going to just move into this that they're now going to just move into this sort of biased retraining a full-time fine you dip your toe in the water there's that video that came out of this woman who was putting her hands in the water near a shark and a shark bit her finger and pulled her into the water and everybody's like oh it was shocking okay that that video is a metaphor for Starbucks Starbucks decided to put their finger into the water with the sjw's and the SJW just drag them under now they're ripping off their digits one by one so enjoy Starbucks I hope that that coffee is some solace to you all right we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Senya
