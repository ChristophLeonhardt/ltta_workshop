directed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Russian government and</font>

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,950
possibly some effect on the election

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,839
outcome well we don't know that we're

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,580
all we know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things we</font>

don't know what what a thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know what if that could had but</font>

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,700
the is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that something that should be</font>

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,010
high on the list of worries even even if

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,320
you allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I would worry high about</font>

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,580
what Russia could do in your free

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,500
shallower Russia did in Ukraine<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non</font>

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,779
NATO country what is keeping Vladimir

14
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,689
Putin tomorrow from doing in Estonia or

15
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,179
Latvia Lithuania what he did in Ukraine

16
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,340
answer is nothing one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,079
Putin is done at home is he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,940
essentially hollowed-out Russian

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,710
institutions you can't speak of a

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,110
Politburo anymore Khrushchev at the

21
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,059
height of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> missile crisis operated</font>

22
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,219
with more constraint and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vladimir Putin</font>

23
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,809
operates with today so that worries me

24
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,430
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we ought to do</font>

25
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,469
quickly is get over<font color="#CCCCCC"> this idea of</font>

26
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,910
assuming that Russia is going to be

27
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,100
benign and what I'm hoping is that mr.

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,960
Trump while he opens dialogue with

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,870
Russia I'm all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor that but I think</font>

30
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've got a strengthened NATO I would do</font>

31
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,039
more to help Ukraine in terms of

32
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,300
defensive weapons but more than anything

33
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,459
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would strengthen NATO so we</font>

34
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,320
narrow the gap between our commitments

35
00:01:07,320 --> 00:00:00,000
and our capabilities
