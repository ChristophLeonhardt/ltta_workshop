the in mainstream media in typical fashion they focused on the real threat Islamophobia salon.com ran this headline quote after the New York City terror attack Fox News leans into nationalism and Islamophobia North Country Public Radio says this headline art as a way to resist negative images and Islamophobia splinter News did this NBC News did this from NBC Muslim Americans brace for backlash after New York attack they're bracing that's the story not the attack that just happened but the bracing that's going to happen for the inevitable backlash that inevitably never happens anchors and writers from MSNBC Teen Vogue The Guardian on and on and on used the same as lame' phobia line New York Times early reporting on the attack refused to report the language properly they wouldn't do it they would not use the phrase Allahu Akbar which is the war cry that the terrorists shouted when he had finished his attack instead The Times used the phrase God is great which is an okay sort of miss translation of that phrase into English their News Alert headline read the motorist yelled god is great in Arabic officials said CNN did exactly the same thing their lower third reporting on the attack said suspect was yelling god is great in Arabic The Associated Press did this in April when they reported the Muslim terrorist yelled god is great best of all here is former journalist Jake Tapper's take on the jihadi battlecry he heard this driver saying yelling Allahu Akbar Allah Akbar during this incident which is now leading authorities to believe that this is as a result that this is now a terrorism case and I'm just getting an update now the FBI is taking over this case because it appears now that this is terrorism the Arabic chanda Allah Akbar god is great sometimes I said under the most beautiful of circumstances and too often we hear of it between being said in moments like this it's beautiful the most beautiful of circumstances that's the story right that's the first thing you should say when reacting to the bad news the terrorists screamed a beautiful phrase that has also denoted Muslim holy war for 14th centuries what'd he look he's said that it was used in bad circumstances too but the first thing that we should note the important point here is that the phrase is also used in nice circumstances sometimes and sure that might be true contrary to popular belief the term Allahu Akbar does not appear in the Quran in the Muslim holy book rather it appears in the hadith which reports the actions and sayings of Muhammad it also doesn't mean God is great it means God is greater or God is greatest probably more precisely translated and sure it's a phrase used in times of joy it's used in times of distress joy birth death holy festivals on and on sort of misses the point doesn't because allahu akbar is the ubiquitous battle cry of muslim terrorists that we've seen for decades and decades in the notes of the terrorists who flew the planes on September 11th we're talking about a Muslim terrorist attack here here is a relevant appearance of the phrase Allahu Akbar in the hadith quote the Prophet set out for Khaybar and reached it at night he used not to attack if he reached the people at night till the day broke so when the day dawned the Jews came out with their bags and spades when they saw the Prophet they said Muhammad and his army the Prophet said Allahu Akbar and Khaybar is ruined for whenever we approach a nation it has tan enemy to fight then it will be a miserable morning for those who have been warned end quote now Andrew Clavin who never gets into Twitter spats despite my telling him how fun they are he pointed this out to Jake Tapper on Twitter he pointed out to Tapper that he was basically saying there are good people on both sides aren't there folks the thing that the mainstream media excoriated Trump for saying in the wake of charlottesville Tapper defended his statement that he went further any accused drew of lying so so drew responded he said all sorts of things can be said at weddings and births it's an inane point that purposely begs the question the nature of our enemy Tapper unhinge idli and bizarrely continued to call Andrew Klavan a liar but of course he provided no evidence for that accusation because Jake Tapper is a Democrat hack who plays a journalist on a fictional television program this does however make clear a key factor in the mainstream media's recent self-immolation which is their abusive language we're living in an age marked defined by language that is not clear and direct but of euphemisms words that make harsh things see mild bad truths appear good and they make clear events seem obscure Democrats just last week ran an ad against Virginia gubernatorial candidate at Gillespie depicting a Republican truck mowing down children of ethnic minority here it is is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American dream Latino Victory Fund paid for and is responsible for the content of this advertisement that's the threat huh that's what we're worried about we're worried about Tea Partiers we're worrying about the Gadsden flag flying on a truck that's not today's Michael we're gonna see an increase on the cooldown period of trucks that's that's right it you know that's what we're that's what we're seeing right that's before our eyes not quite the American people aren't stupid we know that the terrorists didn't scream god is great we know what war looks like we know what peace looks like we know which ideas and vessels for those ideas threaten our lives and our civilization the more the mainstream media insists that our eyes are lying the less credibility they'll have
