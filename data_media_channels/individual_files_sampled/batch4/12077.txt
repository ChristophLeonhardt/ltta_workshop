in New York yesterday during the morning commute a man tried to set off a bombshell and instead blew himself up the man was later identified as a CNN reporter authorities say the explosive device was what they call a pipedream bomb made out of hastily assembled bits of nonsense about Russia unprovable charges of sexual harassment and absurd stories from anonymous sources about how much Diet Coke the president drinks fortunately the president was unharmed by the blast but the CNN anchor had his credibility blown clean off along with his testicles investigators say the CNN journalist was not a lone wolf but was in fact part of a larger organization called CNN the operatives there have apparently been inspired by watching anti-american videos made by Isis the Democrat Party and Hollywood including this propaganda from one sinister source I had a boyfriend many years ago he was my first boyfriend who had his own house and one day I went outside to see what he was doing and he was a hoist ting an American flag up the flagpole in his front yard and I instantly felt very weird it didn't make sense but I felt this feeling of like I felt scared yeah I felt scared it's chilling I know the authorities have advised New Yorkers and all other Americans to be on the lookout for anyone who looks like a Middle Eastern male a movie actor or a mainstream journalist however police don't want to spread panic and say it's unlikely you will actually see anyone from CNN unless you're watching them on television which almost never happens trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the

dot-com / Andrew and you get a free month of skill share test them out you'll see what I'm talking about so yesterday I was speaking about the way that moral panic is being used to distract us from actual morality from the actual things that government does that have to do with our morality because what government doesn't do is govern our sex lives or govern their sex lives or government anything has nothing to do their sex lives have nothing to do with us but it has to do with us is our freedom and you know the thing is we enjoy this too it's like pornography it really is it is like pornography we are more interested in the stories about Roy more diddling a fourteen-year-old if he ever did then we would be interested in stories about regulation you know over the weekend there was a piece in The Wall Street Journal and whether they know a thing or two about business saying the reason the economy is doing so incredibly well is because of Trump pulling back all the regulations and if you see a chart between how many regulations Trump is issued versus the last presidents it's amazing I mean these reduced regulations to a trickle as well as getting rid of old regulations but that's not interesting now I talked about that I've talked about this on the show I've talked about how important it was way before Trump took off his way before he was even running I've talked about regulation but I know that it's not what grabs you sex grabs you and it's it all of us enjoy talking about this stuff and it works exactly the news is now working exactly the way pornography works if you are a guy you have probably looked at pornography if you hadn't haven't just send me a self-addressed stamped envelope I'm joking you don't do that just a couple of bucks and I'll send you some probably but but when you look at pornography if you're paying attention you see that men are wired so that when they look at naked women basically or something that excites them a little click goes off in your head and the whole art of life is making sure that's all we are as bodies were just a series of clicks and chemical reactions as bodies that's what we are but if you want to be the full human being that God made you to be that you're supposed to be that you know you're not you start to try and align those clicks with what your soul is doing and this is just true of the simplest things I mean if I if I could go into your brain and somebody probably could and make you think it was raining right you would see rain you would have that click and there would be the rain but it wouldn't be raining people talk I had Jordan Peterson on and in Peterson said well you know it's no question in his intellectual way this is what intellectuals say they say you know there's no question that it's a value to people to have religious experiences and I said yes but the question is does the religious experience relate to something real does it relate to God and what you want to do is align the religious experience in your mind with the actual God on the other side of the veil right and the same thing is true about sex and love and affection and and to care for somebody else you want to make sure that when those clicks go off it's actually related to something human and deep and rich and soulful and that is part of the whole trick of life the news is constantly encouraging you to do the opposite it's just like pornography it's constantly encouraging you to have that click go off so that you have important conversation you know who was a master of this Obama Obama brought up transgenderism and who should work you know who should use what bathrooms to distract from the fact that he had bobbled the Middle East he had set the Middle East on fire he had sat on the economy so there was 1% growth for years and years and years and years he had bobbled everything but oh look over there there's a transgender person using your daughter's bathroom there's a boy using your daughter's bathroom and we all did it we all went all we were talking about this and when I would say to people this has zero meaning it has zero meaning they would get offended they would get offended what are you talking about this you know would be molesting and people this you know I'd say zero meaning it has zero meaning the only point here is that Barack Obama should not be should not be talking about who uses a bathroom in Tennessee or anywhere else the way I always got around all this the way I always got around the kind of pornographic effects of life was to imagine what would happen after the the feeling passed after the emotion passed so there was you know I I've been in a highly paid worker in very glamorous businesses there were pretty girls around sometimes these pretty girls would be available to me I have a family I have a wife that I adore I don't want to be stepping out of my wife in the way that I would get around the the sensation the temptation the the sudden urge that told me this was it was urgently important that I go off with this girl because she was beautiful and young and available the way I would get around that is I would imagine what was going to happen after the experience was over and I would imagine for instance the look in my children's faces when I had to move out it'll kill your sexual desire in a big big hurry so the people who are panicking over Roy Moore in Alabama just imagine afterwards afterwards when you don't have the votes to pass the Trump agenda when you don't have the votes for tax reform when you don't have the votes for dialing back government for rearranging entitlements and Obamacare it's not gonna be so much fun you can always get rid of rid of Roy Moore but it's gonna be much harder to get rid of I think you get rid of a Democrat if you elect him so just to show you that only one side ask yourself this question is the other side fighting Roy Moore because they want to keep a sex pest out of the Senate no they're fighting Roy Moore for power they see an opportunity I think Steve Bannon blew this he said he was gonna start a revolution Mitch McConnell said don't do it he should have listened to Metra Mitch was right you know and now they see an opportunity and they're going in to get the power and the people on the other side we have to fight to keep our power because our power is cutting back the power of government here's today's New York Times remember yesterday I told you that Al Franken didn't really resign he announced his tention intention to resign and that once Roy Moore lost if Roy Moore lost suddenly Al Franken would not be resigning here is today's New York Times let's take a trip to the op-ed page of The New York Times or as we like to call it knucklehead roe so here is Zephyr Teachout an associate professor of law at Fordham I'm not making her name up and she writes I'm not convinced Franken should quit this is the lead editorial on the op-ed page of the New York Times I care passionately about me two women are routinely demeaned dismiss discouraged and assaulted too many women's careers are stymied or ended because of harassment and abuse and politics where I have worked much of my adult life this behavior is rampant I also believe in zero tolerance and yet a lot of women I know myself included were left with a sense that something went wrong last week with the effective Oster of Al Franken from the United States Senate he resigned he did not resign but he resigned she says after a groundswell of his own Democratic colleagues called for him to step down zero tolerance should go hand in hand with two other things due process and proportionality now the New York Times when Betsy DeVos rescinded Obama's letter which essentially squelched due process for men in universities they didn't care very much about due process at all they ridiculed her commitment to due process on this very same page but suddenly due process matters and proportionality yeah he just grabbed the woman's but we still want al franken's voting in other words it's a scam it's all one-sided it is all pornography been bent on making you lose power lose the power to cut back the government so then they have now they have the women we obviously know who the real target here is always it's always the same target PDD p PT d president the donald is always the the target here so now the women are coming out and these are women who were part of a documentary by the way attacking Trump and they're basically promoting their documentary they came out yesterday saying that all the terrible things that Trump had done to them about 12 years ago as a young receptionist in Trump Tower I was forcibly kissed by mr. Trump during our first introduction mr. Trump repeatedly kissed my cheeks and ultimately my lips in an encounter that has since impacted my life well beyond the initial occurrence and feelings of self-doubt and insignificance I had unfortunately given mr. Trump's notoriety and the fact that he was a partner of my employers not to mention the owner of the building I felt there was nothing I could do given this hostile work environment my only solution at the time was to simply avoid additional encounters with him I do realize that in the grand scheme of things there are far worse cases of sexual harassment misconduct and assault but make no mistake there is no acceptable level of such behavior that some men think they can use their power position or notoriety to demean and attack women speaks to their character not ours I just want to show you how brilliant Trump is on dealing with this however because he really is Kirsten Gillibrand the senator who was leading this charge although she defended Clinton suddenly she thinks she's on to something so now she's calling for an investigation this is this is the plan this is just a it's just a power play that is using is utilizing your pornographic thrill it is utilizing your pornographic thrill as a power play that's all you're watching here you're watching news pornography you you know making you excited so they can get more power so he or she is talking and just watch our Trump's response to this as brilliant as an in Trump should resign these allegations are credible they are numerous I've heard these women's testimony and many of them are heartbreaking and President Trump should resign his position whether he will ever hold himself accountable is something you know you really can't hold your breath for and so Congress should have hearings they should do their investigation they should have appropriate investigations of his behavior and hold him accountable so you are standing by your prominent senator colleagues a Senator Cory Booker and others who have called today for the president to resign I hear you very clearly agreeing with them do you think though that there should be as these women have called for a bipartisan investigation or you calling for an immediate resignation I think she should immediately resign and if he doesn't we should have the investigation so so now hope Trump just I got a you've got a look at it people say that Trump is just doing this stuff by accident it's not so he knows exactly exactly what he's doing so now Trump tweets lightweight lightweight senator Kirsten Gillibrand total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them is now in the ring fighting against Trump very disloyal to Bill and crooked Hillary I so so that's that now he says she's begging for campaign contributions and would do anything for them right now he it's a it just obviously to those of us a pure heart and sound mind it's just he's just referring to political favors but immediately elizabeth warren tweets back she says are you really trying to bully intimidate and slut-shame senator gillibrand so she is accepting she went in there and at was willing to do sexual favors they immediately went for the sexual thing let's let's play the Tomica attack on morning joe she just plays it as if it's obvious that he's talking about sexual favor lightweight senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them is now fighting against Trump very disloyal to Bill and crooked used exclamation point okay so I just want to I just want to say something beyond the fact that that is reprehensible that the president ID states would say something so derogatory and disgusting about a woman we're not surprised mr. president you do it all the time you treat women terribly and you treat the women around you even worse and you treat women like punching bags because it's fun for you because you are intimidated by women that's your problem okay but for the people who work for you you need to act Sarah Huckabee Sanders good luck today in the briefing don't lie and do not defend the president United States for what he did if you do evil to him who evil thinks just basically there they went to the sex place but Trump never did he never went there and they're basically saying they're basically condemning this woman kirsten gillibrand for having gone in and offered from sex I mean Trump is like he's a genius at this he really is and he's got the press so crazy they've made an utter fool of themselves and we'll get to that in just a minute but first first I am leaving I am walking out of here and going to the airport and I have to say you know the people who have arranged my travel have done a wonderful job and they're picking me up and they're doing all this but when you travel for work and you have a

leftist ears tumblr come on over so Trump keeps pulling the same trick on these guys where he leads them into do you know he calls them fake news they get so upset they try to destroy him they actually commit acts of fake news they've just made so many mistakes their mistake about this email thing where they say that Donald Trump jr. got an email from WikiLeaks on September 4th giving him a secret code to their leaked letters but in fact it was September 14th when the letters were available to everybody so now Jim Acosta one of the silliest reporters at CNN there are stupid reporters and silly reporters he goes after Sarah Huckabee Sanders about his dishonesty he's like they're just emphasizing his dishonesty here is Jim Acosta oops I'm sorry that was just his sole speaking well let's hear it his body sis speaking can you cite a specific story that you say is intentionally false that was intentionally put out there to mislead the American people sure the ABC report by Brian Ross I think that was pretty misleading to the American people and I think that it's very telling that that individual had to be suspended because of that reporting I think that shows that the network took it seriously and recognized that it was a problem once and for all that I'm moving on to Jim Stenson and I'm not taking another question from you at this point I'm running at a time but I want to just talk about this one thing that's really going on is how so much of this news this pornography is taking us away from the real news and I have to play this cut this amazing cut Adam Schiff who I really do feel is is a a Joe McCarthy like figure has been slandering Donald Trump and he went on the tapper show over the weekend and said this amazing string of half-truths that he put together to make it sound sinister and this is what is really happening I want to play this and then read the real news wait I'll end with the real news and then we'll get to jonah goldberg here's angelina signs announces he's received stolen emails which we know now came from the Russians and the Russians themselves start publishing the emails through these cutouts you then have Trump jr. in private secret communication with WikiLeaks so we have all of these facts in chronology you'd have to believe that these were all isolated incidents not connected to each other just doesn't make rational sense now can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt will be Muller's question to answer that the Russians communicated the campaign that the way they were going to deliver the help they offered and that the campaign accepted was not by handing the emails directly over to the campaign but by publishing them that will be up to Muller and we continue to try to fill in all of the missing pieces but we do know this the russians offered help the campaign accept that help the Russians gave help and the president made full use of that help and that is pretty damning whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not I may have tacked that last bit on that was Joseph Welsh going after Senator McCarthy but is Senator McCarthy he is the reincarnation of Senator McCarthy everything he said there was unprovable the they still don't know if it was Russia that hacked it he's accusing Trump for a for WikiLeaks haven't published letters which is what they do that's all they do and that somehow that implicates Trump and whenever whenever Tapper would say do you know of any instance where the Russians said we're going to do it this way we're going to do it through WikiLeaks wait did he have any proof I can't comment I can't comment you know that's an issue that we've been investigating here is what we really know okay and I'm reading this from Bill McGurn but a lot of this reporting comes from Fox and Fox Fox News has been doing the only real news about this stuff yeah I'm reading Bill mcgurns column but this comes from Fox start with the lead if this is what we know about the Muller investigation and what has been going on in the in the deep State against Trump start with the lead FBI agent Peter struck who exchanged anti Trump Pro Hillary text messages with his mistress an FBI lawyer named Lisa Paige who was then also working for mr. Muller Andrew Weissman the lead prosecutor not only attended mrs. Clinton's election night soiree but turns out to have cheered an Obama hold over at the Justice Department Sally Yates for her refusal to carry out a presidential order meanwhile and this is what comes from Fox we learned that a senior Justice official Bruce or met with both Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and fusion GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson during the 2016 campaign and that his wife worked for fusion GPS and now Christopher Rae I don't have time to play this but Christopher Rae was stonewalling Congress last week as Jim Jordan was asking him you know did you use this fusion GPS thing this nonsense tab News dossier did you use it to get a FISA warrant you know Trump can release all these documents if he wants he is the head law officer in the country he can release all these off documents and I really believe he should because that's the real news the real news is the deep State the swamp is fighting back for its power and it will use its swampy techniques including engaging you in pornographic news to get you not to pay attention to the fact that they are trying to take over your life Jonah Goldberg really one of my favorite writers and one of the best he is just a terrific writer he is the senior editor at National Review he writes columns from the Los Angeles Times he's the author of two New York Times bestsellers liberal fascism which I say this in the interview he ate an epoch-making book you should read it it changes everything it's the secret history of the American left from Mussolini to the politics of meaning he also wrote the tyranny of cliches how liberals cheat in the war of ideas he's a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute just a great writer and a good guy here is my interview with Jonah Goldberg okay this is like talking to a Bond villain now anything wrong I'll disappear like a shower of sparks in my chair we'll go into the floor and I expect you to die so as I will have already said that kind of anxious Lee but when I introduce you I I have always found you one of the very best political writers in the country I think you are first of all you're a terrific writer and your book liberal fascism I think was epoch-making as I told you at the time but but we're now in a you are now in a position a really interesting position visa vie are the President of the United States and let's start with the the National Review against Trump issue which came out with his big against Trump and some of the biggest names in can the conservative movement are used are you sorry that happened do you think that was a mistake or you're fine with I rich Lowry would be a better person to ask about that and I do think that it gets misunderstood you know it was it was partly my idea but I don't call the shots @nr rich does or at least he thinks he does but I think that uh I think historically it will redound to our benefit I think it gets misunderstood by a lot of people who call it the never Trump issue there are lots of people who contributed to it who were in fact became sort of Trump supporters at least I believe there are it came out on the eve of the the Iowa caucuses so it was before a single vote had been cast and the reaction to it I have to say was not the best moment for a lot of people I was amazed by how many people colleagues and friends of mine on Fox News would say things like how dare the National Review try to tell voters who to vote for and like what do you think political magazines and and so it was it was very interesting as sort of a dye marker about the populist moment when it came out where we got lumped in with these outrageous elites and the establishment trying to tell people what to think when that's actually sort of been part of national reviews mission for better part of 60 years right not to tell people what to think but to make arguments for a certain position so I don't know I think you can make the case corporately that it was a mixed bag and alienated a lot of people I'm perfectly willing to defend it so I'm blue in the face on the grounds that what we were in effect doing was endorsing the field against Donald Trump and I don't see anything as a major intellectual or philosophical or journalistic criteria that says that was a bad idea it might have been bad marketing it might have pissed off a lot of people but I'm I'm fine with all that so so where do you stand now I mean now we're a year in you're looking at the Trump administration what do you think yeah I'm fairly sympathetic to sort of the Ben Shapiro formulation even though I don't use it much myself of you know good Trump bad Trump I think that I don't see the consternation of a lot of people I don't use the term never Trump anymore because I think it's meaningless once the guy gets elected and as I wrote the day after the election I was actually a shockingly good mood because first of all Hillary Clinton wasn't president which is just awesome and at the same time I I tend to call myself a trump skeptic which I remain and and I think that Trump has done a lot of good things core pics are great I think some of the regulatory stuff is really good some of it is overhyped if you look at the specifics I think some foreign policy stuff has been pretty good but I'm also someone who believes in the importance of rhetoric in the classical sense of shaping how people think about important issues and I think on those sorts of things not just a Twitter account but obviously that's the best example of it but but that sort of front I think he's been very damaging to the conservative brand to the Republican cause I don't care that much about the Republican Party it was never a bunch of a team party guy but was I'm very proud of being calling myself a conservative and I think a long term I think he's done significant damage to both brands okay Lou so let's let's talk about that because I I have to say that I was first of all like everybody to completely taken aback by his victory I had the exact same reaction you had that I was stunned at how happy I was in the moment I mean I thought it was a it was a victory there was no question and I wonder if maybe victory doesn't look like what we thought it looked like it so for instance let's let's talk about the Twitter and whether he's damaging the brand we keeps people like us keep saying well he's doing it I like a lot of what he's doing but that Twitter account but maybe what he's doing and the Twitter account are all one thing maybe we're missing something that he sees that we don't is that possible it's possible I'm very skeptical of that I think any attempt to fit Trump's actions into some grand vision of governing or philosophy of politics any of that kind of stuff is a classic example of intellectuals wanting to impose generally chaotic events and I I don't think Trump is motivated by some overarching philosophy about almost not entirely nothing but almost nothing I think he's you know he had the same view he's had the same views wrong views by my lights about trade for the last 30 years and he's consistent on that I think the way he talks about you know national interest in America first is bad but I I think that both hardcore Trump supporters and hardcore sort of Trump resistance people who I think have been behaved stupidly want him to have some grand want there to be some more meat to trumpism than his own sort of glandular lizard brain in the moment actions and we've seen that there's very little to trumpism without the persona of Trump himself Bannen tries to make it into something and whatever he's trying to make it into I think his garbage and nasty and bad for the country and bad for conservatism but you know there's a reason why Bannon was fired it was because he was actually trying to hold a consistent line on something the guys like Julius crimes are every pronounce his name they very much wanted to have an intellectual forum to defend trumpism not necessarily Trump and turns out you can't because eventually your loyalties are torn between a coherent ideological agenda and his actual actions and since Trump as a matter of philosophy and psychology cannot stick to a coherent ideological line beyond his own sort of cult of self personality you either have to choose between an ideological agenda or loyalty to the man himself and I think we've seen that over and over again now let me go back to something you said because you know one one useless meaningless argument that I've been making for years is that the Conservatives don't pay enough attention to the culture and when you say I agree that the America you know first thing is bad it's damaging when I watch Trump with the NFL for instance I think he's doing something actually important it goes up my spine as a as a you know coastal elite it goes right up my the back my neck but why should we accept I mean every every country has its games they always are a place for patriotism and for national unity why should we accept people disrespecting the flag obviously they have the right to do it nobody's challenging that but why shouldn't the president come out and dismiss that an attack that isn't that it isn't that a good thing for the country oh I agree with him largely on the merits of the issue and if he were a FoxNews pundit saying those things I would agree with him almost entirely I think but he's not that he's the president United States and one of the things that I think is valuable at sports and I am perfectly willing to concede that caper Kaepernick and those guys went first right I mean there are the ones who were initially made the problem is that it's supposed to be a safe harbor from politics and one of the things I do not like one of the things I've argued from liberal fascism and before and on where it never sins is that I think politics should be a very small part of our lives and what by joining that battle when it was basically dying right I mean the the kneeling stuff was on its way out you may agree with him on the merits I think what he did was actually damage the NFL and and he did it for reasons that had more to do with wanting to be in the news wanted to be in the headlines again capture everybody's attention and distract from other storylines which I don't think is the most laudable process and I don't think our reasoning or motive and I don't think it and it what it did just would it serve to do was actually politicize these institutions even more and sports more you know I can't help feeling though that he has this feel I mean he's a he was a TV star for ten years I can't help feeling that he has this feel for certain things that may be more thoughtful people don't you know he reminds me a little bit of Randall Patrick McMurphy the hero of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest really who really is not a good person a brawler he's a kind of a thug if you met him in real life you probably wouldn't like him very much but he comes into a system of soft oppression that I think I think would have been locked in place by a Hillary Clinton victory and maybe maybe we needed a ruffian a little bit to break that up is that possible sure that's possible and again I don't think that everything he's done even on the football stuff has been an unalloyed evil or a bad thing I just have a very hard time ascribing to him motives of some grander ideological agenda other than himself and when you say you know what you're offering it sounds like a version of you know I find this all the time along meet Republicans who will say well you know maybe the tweeting is really working for him and I was like okay we'll give me some metric of that right he's got the lowest approval ratings in the history of polling he has galvanized opposition to him he is he's he's making it harder for Republicans to actually carry out his agenda I mean for it for instance when this gets the point about the lizard brain thing if you vote with Donald both for Donald Trump's agenda in the House and the Senate but criticize him verbally the Bannon Easter's will destroy you Trump will go after you but if you screw with his agenda actually do something real to thwart his agenda but suck up to him they lavish you with praise Ben Sasse and corker and even flake vote consistently with the Trump agenda and they're being essentially pelted from the party to one extent or another and from conservatism meanwhile Rand Paul is probably single handedly done more to undermine the Trump agenda in Congress than anybody else but because he sucks up to him in public he gets no grief from anybody this his name is Eldon just voted against the the tax bill which is hugely important for Republicans for Trump's legacy it's the only shot he has of a single major legislative accomplishment in this first year and so when Zeldin voted against it trunk Paul Ryan canceled a fundraiser with them and on the grounds of sort of trying to impose discipline and whip the caucus into supporting the Trump agenda and what does Bannon and his team do they rush in to throw a fundraiser for him because for them anything that hurts the establishment is bad even when the establishment is the one carrying the water for Donner Mitch McConnell has done more for Donald Trump's legacy now then Steve Bannon has yeah right he's the one who got Gorsuch on there he's the one who's green-lighting all of these judges but because Bannon has this idea the establishment is bad and Trump basically just wants sycophants you get this cockeyed absolutely moronic approach to the legislative agenda and so I have a hard time squaring that with competing claims that always this 4d chess player he's trying to work in he has some grand strategy to all this I think he lives in the moment and he listens to the people who have his ear and he doesn't want to get crosswise with Bannon for for cynical political reasons he's supporting Rory Moore who I think even if he wasn't an accused child molester yeah I think would be catastrophic for the Republican brand I think you know I wrote that we should that conservatives should be denouncing him before any of these accusations came out because I think he's a theocratic bigot and a crank and a grifter but this has more on banin than it is on Trump right I mean Bannon went in Jordan and promoted him when Trump was against him and now he's stuck wanting that vote he's got to get that vote in the Senate you know that's all fun I think you guys I mean I I'm I'm far more sympathetic to trumpism right because I think it's more harmless I mean a lot of ways Ben Bannon ISM yeah but at the same time this is he's the president United States he's the head of the party he's the guy who hired this guy and gave him a profile and so at some point it's on him I mean FDR had lots of people that he used to build his coalition and Pitt factions against factions but that was because he was actually a chess player I don't think Transat Trump is a chess player you know I was law lotmore to ask you but I'm almost out of time let me ask you this one last question if you could connect into dots into the unknowable future where you get the best Trump outcome so that four years from now we have you know it's it's just exactly what you would have wanted from this moment what would that look like I don't know that that can be salvaged at this point if you look at the number of Republicans who no longer call themselves Republicans just simply since 2016 if you look at the unbelievably hard feelings among Millennials who are going to be are now a bigger demographic than then the baby boomers you know baby boomers are dying out literally like and politics is supposed to be about addition not subtraction and so I think a lot of the damage to the brand has been done that said look if the tax bill which I think is possible leads to a big economic boom I'm in favor of cutting the corporate tax rate I think that makes a lot of sense you could see the economy going well and Trump plausibly taking some credit for it a lot of this has to do with how he responds to North Korea and all of these kinds of things his legacy on the on the judiciary I think is as good as any other Republicans would have been if and in some ways maybe even better I do think that that's in part because he doesn't care about it and just basically outsources it to the Federalist Society but I think it's possible I mean I think it's entirely possible that we'll look back four years later and say there's been a lot of progress but I don't think it's possible to say that there hasn't been a lot of damage interesting Jonah thanks so much for coming on I hope you come back I have a lot more things I want to interrogate I'm happy to do it I'll have you on my podcast will you do the same thing for an hour excellent I'll be there I just Jonah Goldberg really one of my favorite
