1
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,303
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,004
STUPID COUNTRY ANYMORE.

3
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:14,839
WE'VE STOPPED IT.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:15,940
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,378
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:22,413
AND YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU

7
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,482
WANT, BUT I THINK BORDER

8
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,550
SECURITY AND SECURITY

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,718
GENERAL IS A GREAT ISSUE FOR

10
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:29,487
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

11
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,254
BRIAN: YOU KNOW WHAT?

12
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,189
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S BEYOND

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:32,590
REPUBLICANS.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,891
I THINK THE AVERAGE AMERICAN

15
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:34,692
WANTS BORDER SECURITY.

16
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:36,093
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST

17
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:37,328
CONFUSING ISSUE ON

18
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:37,695
DEMOCRATS.

19
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:41,499
I THINK EVERYBODY REALLY

20
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,833
WANTS SOME SECURITY ON THE

21
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:43,734
SOUTHERN BORDER.

22
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:44,802
THEY ARE CRAZY TO FIGHT THE

23
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:46,470
PRESIDENT ON THE BORDER.

24
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,905
AINSLEY: YOU KEPT SAYING THE

25
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,006
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS

26
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,174
DON'T WANT SANCTUARY CITIES

27
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:51,709
AND THEN ALL THESE CITIES

28
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:52,943
STARTED TO VOTE AGAINST IT

29
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:54,311
LET'S BRING IN TOMI LAHREN

30
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:55,446
WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA.

31
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:56,247
SHE IS A FOX NEWS

32
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:57,181
CONTRIBUTOR AND CAN WEIGH IN

33
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:57,982
ON THIS.

34
00:00:57,982 --> 00:00:59,683
WHY IS BORDER SECURITY SO

35
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:00,518
IMPORTANT TO THE FOLKS WHO

36
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,685
DO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

37
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:02,620
THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE

38
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:02,987
PRESIDENT?

39
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:05,823
>> WELL, CALIFORNIANS AND

40
00:01:05,823 --> 00:01:06,857
OTHER BORDER STATES WE

41
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:07,758
UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE THE

42
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:08,492
MOST VULNERABLE WHEN IT

43
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:09,627
COMES TO THESE ISSUES.

44
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:10,928
BUT IT'S NOT JUST US.

45
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:11,762
WE JUST DEAL WITH THE

46
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:12,997
PROBLEM MORE CLOSE TO HOME.

47
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:14,198
THIS IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE.

48
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:15,666
AS BRIAN SAID, WHEN I HEAR

49
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,834
OUR PRESIDENT DOUBLE DOWN ON

50
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,135
BORDER SECURITY, OF COURSE

51
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:20,538
THAT'S GOING TO BE A WINNING

52
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,840
AGENDA ITEM FOR THIS

53
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,974
PRESIDENT AND THOSE WHO

54
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:24,975
CHOOSE TO SUPPORT BORDER

55
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:25,342
SECURITY.

56
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:26,911
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO ASK

57
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:29,980
IS WHY ARE THE DEMOCRATS SO

58
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,282
AGAINST IT WHY DO THE

59
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:33,350
DEMOCRATS NOT BELIEVE IN THE

60
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,351
INTEGRITY OF OUR BORDERS,

61
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,719
OUR LAWS AND PROTECTING THE

62
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,320
AMERICAN PEOPLE?

63
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,154
THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT

64
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:37,955
NEEDS TO BE ASKED.

65
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,925
NOT WHY IS TRUMP DOUBLING

66
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:41,225
DOWN.

67
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:42,426
OF COURSE THIS PRESIDENT IS

68
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:43,327
DOUBLING DOWN THIS PRESIDENT

69
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,930
BELIEVES IN A SECURE BORDER.

70
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,831
BRIAN: THERE IS A PUSH WITH

71
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,633
NATURE CORY GARDNER AND

72
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,435
MODERATES IN THE HOUSE TO

73
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:53,704
GET SOMETHING DONE ON DACA

74
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,739
BEFORE MID TERMS COME.

75
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:56,807
GO WITH THE MID TERMS WHAT

76
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:58,175
THEY HAVE DONE OR HAVEN'T

77
00:01:58,175 --> 00:01:58,475
DONE.

78
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,076
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

79
00:01:59,076 --> 00:01:59,376
THAT?

80
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:00,210
THE PRESIDENT MAY BE GOING

81
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,079
THERE AND SAYING GIVING ME

82
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,880
THE 25 BILLION FOR THE WALL

83
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,315
I WILL GIVE YOU DACA AND GO

84
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:05,683
BACK FOR CHAIN MIGRATION?

85
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:06,717
GO BACK FOR THE LOTTERY?

86
00:02:06,717 --> 00:02:07,651
DO YOU THINK THAT BENEFITS

87
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,721
HIM OR US?

88
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:13,123
>> I THINK THIS PRESIDENT

89
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,725
HAS SAID MULTIPLE TIMES HE

90
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,093
IS WILLING TO COMPROMISE.

91
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:16,927
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT NOT

92
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,195
ONLY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT

93
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:19,296
FOR THE AMERICANS THAT VOTED

94
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:19,964
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE

95
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,432
OF HIS PROMISE TO BUILD THE

96
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,466
WALL IS THAT BEFORE WE START

97
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,634
DEALING WITH THOSE THAT ARE

98
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:26,303
ALREADY HERE ILLEGALLY THAT

99
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,705
THAT HAS TO BE NUMBER ONE.

100
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:29,573
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO

101
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:31,208
TRUST THAT FIRST AND THEN WE

102
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,142
CAN HAVE A BIGGER

103
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:32,977
CONVERSATION ABOUT

104
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:33,577
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

105
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:35,512
I THINK TO DO IT PETE MEAL,

106
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:38,582
I

107
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:40,217
PIECEMEALIS A MISTAKE.

108
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:40,985
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL STAND

109
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:42,319
BEHIND HIM.

110
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,153
BRIAN: WHICH MEANS NOTHING

111
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:43,887
GETS DONE THOUGH.

112
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,356
>> IT MIGHT MEAN THAT

113
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:46,890
NOTHING GETS DONE

114
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,291
IMMEDIATELY.

115
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,359
BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS

116
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,793
GOING TO BE PRESSURE ON THE

117
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,095
REPUBLICANS AND EACH ON THE

118
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,429
DEMOCRATS TO DO SOMETHING.

119
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,098
AND NOT JUST PIECE BY PIECE

120
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:55,699
BUT HAVE REAL, TRUE

121
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:56,400
IMMIGRATION REFORM FOR THE

122
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,801
FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME.

123
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:58,502
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN

124
00:02:58,502 --> 00:02:59,603
PEOPLE WANT.

125
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:00,804
US AS VOTERS, WE HAVE TO

126
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,106
MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE THAT

127
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:02,406
CLEAR.

128
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:04,975
AND WE VOTE ON ISSUE THAT.

129
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:05,776
PETE: DEMOCRATS IN RESISTING

130
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:06,710
THIS PRESIDENT ON THE WALL

131
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,946
HAVE TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE

132
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:11,315
HIS POLICIES AS INHUMANE

133
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,651
WHEN A PHOTO SURFACED OF

134
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,885
CAGED MY GRANTS A COUPLE

135
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:15,653
DAYS AGO.

136
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,222
THEY WENT OVER THE EDGE.

137
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,523
JOHN FAVREAU FORMER SPEECH

138
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:20,224
WRITER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA

139
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:21,058
TWEETED THIS IS HAPPENING

140
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,292
RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY

141
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:23,661
DEBATE THAT MATTERS IS HOW

142
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,596
WE FORCE OUR GOVERNMENT TO

143
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,665
GET THESE KIDS BACK TO THEIR

144
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,266
FAMILIES AS FAST AS HUMANLY

145
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:29,633
POSSIBLE.

146
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,335
TURNS OUT OOPS THESE PHOTOS

147
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:33,003
ARE FROM 2014 WHEN BARACK

148
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:36,240
OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT.

149
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,608
>> TURNS OUT MANY ON THE

150
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:38,709
OTHER SIDE ARE NOT CONCERNED

151
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:39,810
WITH THE TRUTH SO LONG AS

152
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,345
THEY CAN ATTACK PRESIDENT

153
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:41,645
TRUMP.

154
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:42,980
THIS WAS A GREAT MISSTEP ON

155
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,814
THEIR PART.

156
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:44,982
AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW

157
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:46,550
THAT THE LEVEL OF PARTISAN

158
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,218
POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY HAS

159
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:49,553
REACHED SUCH ANTICS STREAM

160
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:50,821
LEVEL THAT THE TRUTH REALLY

161
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:51,588
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

162
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:53,791
HAVE YOU AN IMAGE, YOU

163
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,259
CIRCULATE IT AND WHAT THE

164
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:56,193
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS FAKE

165
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,961
NEWS IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD FOR

166
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:58,262
THEM.

167
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,430
MOVING FORWARD I HOPE THAT

168
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,330
AS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

169
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,865
WE CAN DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND

170
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,233
STAND FOR OUR BELIEFS AND

171
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,435
NOT JUST PICK THE SIDE OF

172
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:06,970
WHO WE VOTED FOR OR OUR

173
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,571
PARTISAN LINE.

174
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,872
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY

175
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:12,910
IS BASED ON.

176
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,544
AINSLEY: MAINSTREAM MEDIA

177
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,180
HEARD THIS STORY OF HUSBAND

178
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,346
DEPORTED BACK TO MEXICO.

179
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:18,248
MAINSTREAM MEDIA RUNS WITH

180
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,550
IT AND SAYS FAMILY BROKEN

181
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,817
UP.

182
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,819
HUSBAND SENT BACK TO MEXICO.

183
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,320
THIS IS INHUMANE.

184
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,954
THIS IS WRONG.

185
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:25,422
LISTEN TO THE WIFE BEING

186
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:26,023
INTERVIEWED AND I DON'T

187
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:27,257
THINK MAINSTREAM MEDIA WAS

188
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:28,425
EXPECTING HOW CALM SHE WAS

189
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:31,161
AND HER LACK OF ANIMOSITY.

190
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:31,929
LISTEN.

191
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:34,765
>> I AM NOT UPSET AT OUR

192
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:35,699
GOVERNMENT DUE TO THE FACT

193
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,835
THAT I AM A U.S. CITIZEN AND

194
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:39,536
THAT OUR LAWS COME FIRST.

195
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,038
OUR LAWS ARE JUST BROKEN AND

196
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:43,340
NEED TO BE FIXED.

197
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,808
BUT, I CAN'T BE MAD AT TRUMP

198
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:45,843
FOR DOING HIS JOB BECAUSE

199
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,444
THAT IS HIS JOB TO PROTECT

200
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:49,246
US AS U.S. CITIZENS FROM

201
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,281
CRIMINALS.

202
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:51,715
BRIAN: OOPS.

203
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:52,483
I NEVER EXPECTED THAT

204
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,951
ANSWER.

205
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,753
IF YOU ARE ON CNN YOU DON'T

206
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,989
EXPECT THAT ANSWER, DO YOU?

207
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:00,324
>> OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

208
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,625
THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT

209
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,262
LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND EVEN

210
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:06,930
FAMILY MEMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS

211
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,998
EXPECT BORDER SECURITY THERE

212
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:09,399
IS A REASON PEOPLE COME TO

213
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,168
THIS COUNTRY AND WIN THE

214
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:11,869
AMERICAN DREAM.

215
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,137
IT'S FOR THE SAFETY WE

216
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,004
PROMISE OUR CITIZENS.

217
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,272
SO LEGAL IMMIGRANTS LOOK AT

218
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:16,673
OUR BORDER AND THEY WANT IT

219
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:17,908
TO BE SECURE AS WELL.

220
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,610
THAT'S WHY THEY LIVE IN THIS

221
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,213
COUNTRY IN PART SO THEY CAN

222
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,281
BE SAFE AND SECURE.

223
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,117
THERE IS NOT DOESN'T BELIEVE

224
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:28,418
WE NEED IMMIGRATION REFORM.

225
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:29,586
IT'S HARD TO SEE FAMILIES

226
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:30,354
BROKEN UP LIKE THIS.

227
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:31,221
THE FACT THAT SHE

228
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,289
APPRECIATES OUR COUNTRY AND

229
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,724
RULE OF LAW SPEAKS A LOT TO

230
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:34,892
THE CHARACTER OF THIS

231
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:35,425
PERSON.

232
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:37,060
BRIAN: IT'S AMAZING, THEY

233
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,961
SAY 70 PERCENT OF

234
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:38,796
IMMIGRATION REFORM WE ALL

235
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,130
AGREE ON.

236
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,365
30% WITH THE BORDER WALL AND

237
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:43,867
DACA AND THE ILLEGALS HERE

238
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,969
ALREADY WHICH STOPS THE

239
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:46,470
WHOLE PROCESS.

240
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,738
KEEP THE COUPLES TOGETHER

241
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:48,705
THOSE PEOPLE WHO MARRY

242
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:49,506
SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER

243
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:49,840
COUNTRY.

244
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,041
ALL THAT STUFF JUST TAKES

245
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,676
TOO LONG AND IS TOO COSTLY.

246
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,378
THE LINE IS TOO LONG FOR

247
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:55,879
PEOPLE TO DO IT LEGALLY.

248
00:05:55,879 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT WE ALL GET HUNG UP ON
