1
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:09,120
we're renovating large sections of walls
it will be brand new by the time we

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,889
finish we're building samples of four
different walls in order to make the

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,210
joist and after the choice is made we'll
leave the have it in budget or some

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,529
place as if the Democrats are going to
approve it then we're not going to do

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,130
what they want you know I think it'll
work out we're working on a deal for

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,239
Dhaka but a lot has to do with the
amount of security we want very heavy

7
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,110
security of the border who want
surveillance we want a lot of things at

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,329
the corner and ultimately we don't want
them to obstruct with the wall but you

9
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,070
say you understand we're renovating
massive sections of wall right now and

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,149
essentially it'll be brand new hoping to
be able to use them doctor now and the

11
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,329
wall very soon but the wall will happen
