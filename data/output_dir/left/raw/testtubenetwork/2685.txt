1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,840
The development of culture, countries and even entire empires has been forged

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,440
in the name of organised religion.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,460
Historically, it would often indicate and dictate a person's world view, their level of education;

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,320
even their role within a community.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,560
But today, the significance of religion is not what it used to be.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,140
According to PEW Research, those with no religious affiliation, who they call "nones",

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,240
are growing faster than ever before.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,480
In North America, they are the second largest religious group,

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,280
and in the US, they've surpassed catholics and all non-christian faiths.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,280
With such an influx of people who aren't commited to a spiritual deity,

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,160
we wanted to know: what are the most atheist countries in the world?

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,120
Well, first of all, analyzing non-religiosity is difficult,

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,060
because the term can cover a lot of different belief systems.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,480
There's Positive Atheism, which is a belief that there are no gods;

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,820
Agnosticism, the belief that the existence of gods is unknowable;

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,080
and those who don't ascribe to any major religion, but are nonetheless spiritual.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,840
Estimates by sociologists and analysts peg the total number anywhere from half a billion, to over one billion,

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,040
based on this range of definitions.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,040
According to PEW, roughly seventy-six percent of the world's non-religious population lives in Asia

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,000
and the Pacific.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,380
Where deity-based religion is historically less influential than it is in western-european countries.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,980
By comparison, about twelve percent of the remainder live in Europe,

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,540
and another nine percent combined live in North and South America.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,620
So while Europe remains overwhelmingly religious, it may come as a surprise to find that the Czech Republic

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,300
is one of the most atheistic countries in the world.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,020
In a 2015 poll, nearly three quarters of respondents declared themselves religiously unaffiliated,

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,440
the highest percentage in all of Europe.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,300
One of the biggest reasons is that throughout the twentieth century,

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,980
while Catholicism was dominating the rest of the continent,

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,240
religion was seen as an outdated relic of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,080
Then, in the mid-twentieth century, the country became part of the Soviet Bloc

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,760
which, under communism, deliberately avoided a religious slam.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,200
By 1993 when Czechoslovakia dissolved into the Czech Republic and Slovakia,

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,660
there was no historical religion to cling to,

35
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,800
and today an overwhelming majority of Czechs claim their religion as "nothing in particular".

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,700
Another country that when surveyed claimed its population as atheist is Japan.

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,520
But in a very unique way.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,460
Nearly eighty percent of the country actually practices a form of ethnic religion called "Shinto",

39
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,300
and is therefore, technically, highly religious.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,120
But Shinto, by its very nature, doesn't rely on a central deity

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,560
and its reference as an actual religion is a relatively recent classification.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,980
For much of its history it was considered a philosphical mythology

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,000
that focused on nature as a source of spirituality.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,320
It's believed that all natural things have spirits which are sometimes referred to as Gods.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,080
So the distinction of Shinto being an atheist religion is surprising, but accurate.

46
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,740
With no scripture or dogmatic beliefs, practitioners of Shinto are considered atheists,

47
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,500
making Japan one of the most uniquely atheist countries in the world.

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,180
However, in both practice and demographics, the largest collection of atheists is in China.

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,100
Countrywide only seven to nine percent of the population claims belief in a higher deity.

50
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,500
This lack of religion has deep historical and political roots,

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,020
starting with the widespread adherence to Confucianism.

52
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,780
Not unlike Shinto, Confucianism is considered a humanist religion or philosophy,

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
and it doesn't have central deities.

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,880
Alongside Buddhism and Taoism,

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,320
these three spiritual religions have shaped a communal but atheist culture.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,360
Additionally, China has been a communist country since 1949. And just like the formerly soviet Czechoslovakia,

57
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,860
China deliberately avoids a religious ideology. Religion is seen as a tool used to oppress common citizens

58
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,960
and it was explicitly outlawed by the country's central leader, Mao Zedong.

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,560
Today, a number of laws and regulations so prohibit religious observation.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,720
For example, holders of public office are not allowed to practice any religion,

61
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,400
and in 2016, new education rules banned parents from promoting religious beliefs in their children or in schools.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,780
Overall, China is by far the most atheist country in the world.

63
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,580
As an addendum, we have to mention North Korea. The rogue state is impossible to accurately survey,

64
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,000
but likely has one of the lowest rates of organized religion.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,700
Why? Because organized religion is firmly discouraged in favor of worshiping the country's leaders.

66
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,580
Instead, many North Koreans practice the atheist traditions of Korean Shamanism and Cheondoism.

67
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,540
In spite of the growing popularity of atheism in formerly religious regions, like North America and Europe,

68
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,720
the movement is unlikely to take over the rest of the world.

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,560
In areas such as the Middle East and Africa, rates of atheism are incredibly low: between one and five percent

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,640
while their populations are growing exponentially.

71
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,800
In fact, statistically, those who are religiously unaffiliated tend to be older, and have fewer children

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
than those who are religious.

73
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,540
According to PEW, by 2060 the world will have more religious adherence than ever before,

74
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,720
and its likely that religion will continue to shape global society as we know it.

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,180
So which countries are overwhelmingly dictated by religion, and what effect has it had on them?

76
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,380
Well, one country would be The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

77
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,940
Find out a little about its war-torn history and just how powerful it really is today by watching this video.
