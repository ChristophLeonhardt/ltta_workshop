1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,500
Nestled between rolling hills, Rwanda’s
capital is friendly and welcoming

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,240
confounding preconceptions.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,210
Because 24 years after the genocide which
shocked the world

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,090
Kigali has worked hard to reinvent itself,
with its eyes on the future.

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,169
With a host of startups, a burgeoning art
scene, great dining and some of the world’s

6
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:27,309
best coffee

7
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,660
this African capital is building a reputation
with tourists.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,880
Welcome to Kigali.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,079
With a population just over 1.1 million people,
Kigali is both geographically and culturally

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,589
the centre of Rwanda.

11
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:55,129
It’s streets are spotlessly clean streets,
crime is low and the economy is growing.

12
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,859
Kigali is capturing tourists who used to only
pass through on their way to safari or gorilla

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,740
tours.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,260
After the shocking events of 1994 the city
and country wants to show the world another

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,420
side and create a new legacy.

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,540
Kigali is trying to model it’s economic
growth off the likes of Singapore and Seoul,

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,940
complete with a citywide obsession with keeping
the streets clean.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,580
Citizens are required once a month to partake
in a giant neighbourhood cleaning effort.

19
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,910
On top of that it’s illegal to import, use
or sell plastic bags and it’s taken very

20
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,170
seriously.

21
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,110
Plastic bag traffickers, yeah that’s a thing,
have been fined and even jailed.

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,870
As a tourists you’ll warned not to bring
any into the country when you arrive.

23
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,980
Staying in the city is easy, with over 100
hotels including the big names like the Marriott,

24
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,870
Radisson Blu and the Hilton.

25
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,380
But, arguably the best known is the Hotel
de Milles Collines.

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,180
It was here in 1994 that 1,200 people took
refuge during the genocide.

27
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,440
That story inspired the film Hotel Rwanda.

28
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:14,670
At the time is was the city’s premium spot
but these days newer hotels offer more luxury.

29
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,020
Despite that - sitting in the lobby you can feel the charm is still here.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,520
Internationally Rwandan coffee is regarded
as the best in East Africa

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,080
but it’s no popular with the locals.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,140
Rwanda’s are more into tea but despite this
Kigali has a handful of excellent coffee shops.

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,710
This is Question Coffee where the beans are
sourced from female farmers and roasted in

34
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,620
house.

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,960
And this is the Shokola Cafe - a trendy spot above Kigali’s public library.

36
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,780
Here’s a quick tip when heading out in Kigali,
dress up!

37
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,340
The locals all look sharp and wandering around
in some old t-shirt and shorts is not going to cut it

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,340
When travelling around the city you’ll
notice bright murals dotted around.

39
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,120
This is the work of a public arts social enterprise.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,020
In a city with almost no graffiti this is
public art supported by the government.

41
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:21,569
So it's more positive messages than free thinking
street art anarchy but the scene here is maturing.

42
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:26,540
There are a number of boutique shops where
you can pick up some of the local arts and crafts.

43
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,720
This the Go Kigali Boutique, which also offer
city tours that'll show you around the

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,380
the town's most exciting spots.

45
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,340
Finally, finish off your day with a drink
looking over the city at the Hilton’s new

46
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,430
hotel in the centre of town.

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,160
With 180 degree views and an excellent cocktail
menu, you can watch the sunset in style.

48
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,599
Because, with so much excellent food, drink
and ease,

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,980
Kigali could well become a tourist must see
in the next few years. So get in quick before

50
00:03:59,140 --> 00:00:00,000
the crowds arrive.
