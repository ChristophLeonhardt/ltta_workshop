recently it was discovered that the Nestle corporation had been abusing their water permits in California essentially stealing millions of gallons of water to bottle and sell to consumers and one of the most drought ravaged states in the country the Nestle's disgusting story goes far beyond water stealing so let's talk about their dirty history Peter you know you follow this story you know an awful lot about it you have dealt you have dealt with real Wall Street crooks in your in your career that's kind of your specialty is dealing with the Silk Stocking white-shoe Wall Street criminals what is your take on this story is it as bad as it sounds it's worse I mean you know it's funny you think of you think of Nestle what do you think you think chocolate chip cookies wholesome you know it doesn't it doesn't exude a problematic company but when you look at their history and what they've done over decades this example is perfect the one in California it's a great example of kind of what their corporate culture is they had a right to extract water from San Bernardino which is one of the the forests out there at night 1947 8 million gallons per year instead they've taken out 60 million gallons a year and exceeded the term that at least by decades and it's kind of an oops so they bottle it up and sell it while people don't have water which makes it even worse this is the goodies a seem almost like experts in capitalizing on tragedy I mean if you look at their whole history first of all they're doing this in one of the as I just said one of the most drought ravaged states in the country they're also you know expect them in Flint Michigan yeah another great example there they're extracting water out of Flint and bottling it when they the folks and residents of Flint is everybody knows in their national story they don't have access to clean water and what's Nestle doing capitalizing on that problem and selling them back clean water clean water should be a basic right in this country I mean we're not we're not in sub-sahara Africa where we're trying to dig wells people should have access to clean water and Nestle is capitalizing on on places like Flint Michigan or or California where people don't have water to live every day well isn't it based on Nestle's a position that there's no natural right to water oh absolutely I think about that yo actually said that yeah he came right out and said no these people don't have any right if we can buy it we can we can extract it and we can sell it back to them that's capitalism at its very best that's that's there isn't its wax wax regulatory control again is just another example of hey I tell you what if we can make you know tens and hundreds of millions of dollars capitalizing on someone's unfortunate situation we'll do that we'll violate our lease will extract four or five hundred percent more than we were supposed to and guess what if I get caught nobody really notices there's no fine and the state of California has actually said we're just gonna renegotiate the cap so here we know we've caught them there's no question they're caught red-handed committing fraud right lying to the government right stealing a not stealing a natural resource now if anybody watching this program were to do that if they were to say hey look I'm gonna dam up my backyard I'm gonna I'm gonna keep all the water and then I'm gonna sell it back to the neighborhood so they can water their lawn they end up in jail without you laugh at it sounds ridiculous yeah but exactly but any question they would land it in jail I think is my point right and I think the problem here is what what California is doing by not not treating them like criminals is they're perpetuating a culture aren't they no absolutely I don't care if it's if it's the EPA I don't care if it's Wall Street I don't care if it's the DEA it's at the end of the day we we give everyone that wears a suit a get out of jail free card and they get a slap on the wrist the taxpayers end up paying the fine of the taxpayers of shareholders and to paying the fine there's no ramifications for it if for once somebody would just get sent down the river ISM and we would we would not have these problems over and over right then an NBA school when these cats are trying to come out and be a CEO they can tell the story of the Nestle's dude that you know stole all the ball or stole all the water lied to the government just committed just pure theft that somebody went to jail
