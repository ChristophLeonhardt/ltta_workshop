it's bad enough that the likes of YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are booting people off their platforms for essentially being politically incorrect but in Quebec a couple of stories are making the rounds pertaining to how the authorities are going after old-school media and it should be cause for concern for all those who cherish freedom of the press and freedom of expression now normally I wouldn't go to bat for the CBC but because I'm like the umpire behind home plate I calls them like I seize them meaning I support the CBC's French service Radio Canada regarding the two disturbing cases hinging on press freedom now the first case is equal parts bizarre and outrageous namely Radio Canada reporter Antoine Trapani was chasing down a story and soon found himself being arrested for criminal harassment gracious what did mr. Trapani a do did he break into a home did he illicit Lee wiretap a phone line oh no chance folks nothing even is remotely dramatic or unlawful as that rather he was simply trying to get an interview via email from a person who was key to a news story he was working on see three years ago an Ottawa judge ordered Yvonne Dube to stop providing unauthorized legal services and practicing law without authorization that's a big no-no in the lawyer world in any event Trapani a was doing a story on the Dube situation and reached out to her Dube initially agreed to be interviewed but later changed her mind so it was that Trapani a followed up with an email offering Dube another chance to be interviewed a single solitary email written in a civil professional manner and guess what Dube promptly contacted the gatineau police who instead of laughing in du Bay's face actually dispatched some cops to arrest the reporter beignet charging him with criminal harassment now look folks if sending a single email to try and score an interview with an unwilling recipient is now the law enforcement benchmark for criminal harassment I would suggest to you that 99.9% of journalists the world over including yours truly need to be thrown behind bars thankfully crown prosecutors ultimately decided that no charges would be laid after they reviewed the case well it was a shite case from the get-go but the question arises did the police officer who arrested Trapani momentarily forget he was carrying out law enforcement in the province of Quebec as opposed to the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea now the second attack on press freedom in Quebec is more serious and it emanates not from the boys in blue but from the judiciary namely Quebec investigative journalist Marie Maude Denis has been ordered by Quebec Superior Court to reveal the names of confidential sources now for those not in the media business promising a source anonymity and then revealing the name of that source to anyone ranks right up there with plagiarism in terms of committing a cardinal sin indeed revealing a source who was promised confidentiality would be akin to a Catholic priest listening to confession all day and then telling the congregation the following Sunday about all the juicy stories he heard and who he heard them from in the denne case she was working with Radio Canada's investigative program in quote a and reported on corruption within the construction industry according to a CBC a story this expose led to the establishment of the Charbonneau Commission and later to the resignations of Laval mayor GL vallencourt as well as Montreal mayor's Gerald Tremblay and Michael Applebaum but lawyers for the defense allege that media reports including those by Denis meant that it was impossible for their clients to get a fair trial so it was that Denis was asked to testify and divulge her sources something she rightfully claims would violate her journalistic integrity actually folks doing so would destroy her journalistic credibility if she sold out her sources on this who would ever trust Danny again this could potentially mean the end of her career at the very least she wouldn't be very effective as an investigative reporter anymore now Radio Canada however is appealing the decision which is good because the way I see this issue there doesn't seem to be any proof that Dube was being factually incorrect with her reporting and that being the case it would seem that the defense is on a fishing expedition at best and a witch-hunt at worst bottom line regarding both Quebec cases I'm not all that keen on those in law enforcement or those in the judiciary regulating the craft of journalism according to their whims especially since in either case no actual crime be it libel slander or defamation was ever committed better the police and judges concentrate on actually putting the bad guys behind bars and allow journalists to be journalists otherwise we shall all be residing in a country in which a free press is free in name only for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
