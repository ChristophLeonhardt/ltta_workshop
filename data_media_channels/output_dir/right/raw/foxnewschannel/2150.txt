1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:03,314
AND HE TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT.

2
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:04,049
NBC ISSUED A CORRECTION SAYING

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,551
THAT HE WAS SURVEILLED GOOD THE

4
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:08,319
MEANING AND THE DIFFERENCE OF

5
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:09,320
THAT AND A MOMENT.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,523
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, MICHAEL

7
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:13,024
CAVUTO, AND JONATHAN TURLEY,

8
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:17,328
FIRST WE GO TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN

9
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:18,530
MANAGER CORY LEWANDOWSKI, NICE

10
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,064
TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

11
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:20,231
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

12
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:20,965
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE

13
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:24,869
SEEN A REAL SORT OF TACT, REAL

14
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:25,570
CHANGE IN HOW THEY ARE GOING

15
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,739
ABOUT THIS.

16
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,307
>> YES, I THINK THAT THAT IS

17
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:29,908
RIGHT.

18
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,744
WHAT YOU SEE IS MAYOR GIULIANI,

19
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:34,212
VERY WELL-KNOWN, WELL-RESPECTED,

20
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,281
FORMER PROSECUTOR UNDERSTANDS

21
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,549
WHAT THE MUELLER TEAM IS TRYING

22
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:39,184
TO DO AND WHAT HE IS OUT LYING

23
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:42,320
IS VERY CLEAR, THERE'S BEEN NO

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,121
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION

25
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:43,888
WHATSOEVER.

26
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:45,356
SO FOR THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE

27
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:46,124
INVESTIGATION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED

28
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:48,059
TO BE LOOKING INTO WHETHER

29
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,727
RUSSIA COLLUDED WITH THE TRUMP

30
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:51,062
CAMPAIGN TO IMPACT THE ELECTION,

31
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:52,030
THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED.

32
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,531
AND NOW IT HAS SPUN OFF IN A

33
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:54,933
SERIES OF DIFFERENT OTHER THINGS

34
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,067
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING INTO AND

35
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,169
WHAT THE MAYOR IS SAYING IS

36
00:00:58,169 --> 00:00:59,170
LET'S END THIS WHERE WE ARE

37
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,538
GOING TO FIGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU

38
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:01,739
REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO.

39
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,141
>> Martha: WHAT YOU THINK RUDY

40
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,843
GIULIANI REALLY PICKED UP ON IN

41
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:05,844
THE MEETING WITH ROBERT MUELLER

42
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:06,578
WHEN HE TOOK OVER THE JOB AND

43
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:08,146
SAID, LET'S SIT DOWN AND TALK

44
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,147
ABOUT WHERE WE ARE?

45
00:01:09,147 --> 00:01:10,415
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE PICKED UP

46
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,918
ON THAT TRIGGERED?

47
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,287
>> WELL, I DO NOT KNOW, BUT MY

48
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,289
GUESS WOULD BE THAT THE MAYOR

49
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:20,925
SAT DOWN WITH THE MUELLER PROBE

50
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:22,527
PEOPLE AND TO REALIZE THAT THEY

51
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:24,129
HAD NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF

52
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,330
COLLUSION, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT

53
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,397
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING

54
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:27,565
AND EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN

55
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,534
SAYING FROM DAY ONE, THERE IS NO

56
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:30,101
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.

57
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:30,835
IF THAT IS WHERE THE GOAL WAS

58
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,504
SUPPOSED TO BE WAS TO FIND ANY

59
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:35,507
POTENTIAL EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION

60
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:37,075
BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

61
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:37,809
RUSSIANS OR FOREIGN OFFICIALS,

62
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:38,943
NONE OF THAT EXISTS.

63
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:39,844
AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT

64
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:41,212
THE MAYOR FOUND OUT DURING THAT

65
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:43,148
TIME WAS THAT IT DID NOT EXIST.

66
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:44,149
>> Martha: WE ARE ABOUT TO

67
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:45,683
TALK TO MICHAEL CAVUTO THAT SAYS

68
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:48,620
THAT HE WAS SHOCKED AT

69
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,921
EVERYTHING THAT THE MUELLER

70
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:51,356
TEAM, KNEW ABOUT EVERY INTRICACY

71
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:53,324
OF THIS CAMPAIGN.

72
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,360
SO ONE OF THE THINGS I AM STILL

73
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,295
GOING BACK TO IS THE ISSUE OF

74
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:57,795
THE 49 QUESTIONS.

75
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,831
I WANT TO TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY

76
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:00,798
AT THIS PASSAGE FROM

77
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:01,466
"THE WASHINGTON POST" STORY.

78
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,935
IT SAYS IN THE WAKE OF THE TEST

79
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:06,871
MARCH 5TH MEETING, MUELLER'S

80
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,673
TEAM AGREED TO PROVIDE THE

81
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:09,574
PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS WITH MORE

82
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:12,076
SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE

83
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:12,911
SUBJECT THAT THE PROSECUTORS

84
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,112
WANTED TO DISCUSS.

85
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:15,847
WITH THOSE DETAILS IN HAND,

86
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:18,583
TRUMP LAWYER JAY SEKULOW

87
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,819
COMPILED A LIST OF 49 QUESTIONS

88
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:22,720
THAT THE TEAM BELIEVE THE

89
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,922
PRESIDENT WOULD BE ASKED.

90
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:25,123
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE 49

91
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:26,691
QUESTIONS DID NOT COME FROM

92
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:28,526
MUELLER SIDE, THEY CAME FROM JAY

93
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:28,860
SEKULOW.

94
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,162
DO YOU KNOW IF THAT IS TRUE?

95
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,931
>> I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS TRUE,

96
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,766
BUT WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS HOW

97
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:35,733
ALL OF THIS INFORMATION GETS

98
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,202
PLAYED OUT IN THE MEDIA EVERY

99
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:37,502
DAY.

100
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:38,937
LOOK, IT IS REALLY ASTONISHING,

101
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:41,039
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SERIES

102
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,639
OF PROFESSIONALS HAVING

103
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,308
COMMUNICATIONS BACK AND FORTH

104
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:44,275
ABOUT IF THE PRESIDENT IS GOING

105
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:46,311
TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE AN

106
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,745
INTERVIEW, WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE

107
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:49,914
CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE,

108
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,349
INTERROGATORY, QUESTIONS AND

109
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:52,016
ANSWERED, OR SOMETHING ELSE?

110
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,718
WE SEE ALL OF THIS IN THE NEWS

111
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:54,152
EVERY DAY.

112
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:55,453
MAYBE THAT IS A CREDIT TO SOME

113
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:56,487
OF THE MEDIA AGENCY IS PAID BY

114
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:58,122
IT TO ME IT IS MORE DISTURBING

115
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:59,123
OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS

116
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:00,124
GETTING OUT OF BEING LEAKED ALL

117
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:01,092
OVER THE PLACE.

118
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,894
>> Martha: THERE IS A LOT OF

119
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:05,330
IT, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU

120
00:03:05,330 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK OF $130,000, HE SAID THAT
