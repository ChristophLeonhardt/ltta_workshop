so my name is Luke Harding I'm a journalist and a writer and my new book is called collusion and it's about Donald Trump and Russia I know about Russian espionage I suffer from it myself to some degree I spent four years in Moscow so Guardians bureau chief and I had goons from the the FSB basically the KGB breaking into my apartment following me around the head of icy streets of Moscow sometimes in quite a kind of comic sort of a way you don't really grow accustomed to FSB surveillance but what we discovered baby you didn't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out there's some strange people have been inside the flat because unlike in the movies they left a series of blindingly obvious clues and I took advice in the British Embassy in Moscow from from from different mats from London and they said look you know terribly sorry old chap but your your your apartment is bugged and I said well can you do something about it and they said no we can't and I discovered the head video as well including in the bedroom I think I understand kind of how how these sort of into Russian intelligence people think that they are convinced that any American journalist anybody shown us that we're all spies actually secretly working for the CIA or mi6 and that our goal is to kind of undermine Russia by writing kind of propaganda obviously that's kind of crazy and and and and wrong but but paradoxically that kind of gives us a degree of protection because there's one code for foreign spies they can be harassed they can be seduced they can be exploited or surveilled but ultimately you don't kill them the people you kill are Russians who have betrayed the state and deserve the ultimate punishment the reason it's relevant is when you think about what happened in 2013 when Donald Trump famously visited the ritz-carlton hotel for the Miss Universe beauty pageant did the Russian spy on him of course they did it's what they do for any kind of important guests they would spy on them so it's not really a question about whether they would have sought to kind of entrap him it's a question of how he may or may not have behaved and really any Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin they're the answers there
