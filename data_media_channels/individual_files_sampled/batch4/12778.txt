so what we've seen is almost a platonic inversion of the natural consequences of actions if this had happened to a Democrat Republicans would be crying impeachment if Republicans had if this happens to a Republican Democrats will cry for impeachment the truth is we have to come up with some sort of objective standard as to what impeachment is appropriate I am Not sure that we've reached that standard yet given the fact that Michael Cohen is not the most reliable witness given the fact that we are not sure whether or not this is a crime in totality and most of all given the fact that even if this was a crime we're not sure whether it rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors at this point that's not stopping the Democrats from celebrating and ordinate Lee Kathy Griffin was out there celebrating in the most bizarre possible fashion she released a video of herself dancing topless in front of a window honestly when I first saw this Kathy Griffin blocked me long ago on Twitter to my great fortune I'm very happy about that I was wondering why there was a video of carrot top dancing in front of a window and then it turns out it's just a clown it's actually Kathy Griffin dancing topless as they announce all of the charges in the michael cohen situation
