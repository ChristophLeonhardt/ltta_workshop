now you're so strong when it comes to the freedom and dignity of the Iranian people yep but you have different meaning of freedom and dignity when it comes to the Palestinian people who've been being brutalized for over 50 years of occupation the Palestinians now have to show their world that they want to come to the table as of now they're not coming to the table but they ask for aid we're not giving the aid we're gonna make sure that they come to the table and we want to move forward with the peace process so as you just heard there the US ambassador to the UN has revealed Trump's plans to stop funding a UN agency that's giving a to Palestinians refugees shortly after that the u.s. leader himself then suggested cutting donations to the Palestinian administration fair in a tweet he claims that despite giving them hundreds of millions of dollars a year as they show no appreciation or respect to the u.s. because of it Trump also went on to suggest cutting aid because according to him the Palestinians aren't willing to talk peace with Israel over that's something that the Palestinian administration doesn't at all agree with the president's office there says that Jerusalem in fact is not for sale and that they're not backing away from negotiations but when I'll distress that these negotiations should be based on international law last year the Palestinian Authority received around 300 million dollars in aid from the US it's big son but that pales in comparison to the three billion dollars that Israel received from Washington let's get the view now from a staff of our Guti the general secretary of the Palestinian national initiative joining us live sir thanks for your time I suppose end of the day like it or not it is after all Washington and the president's decision about where American money should be spent or not no let me say first of all that the most the the worst thing in his statement and his Twitter was his declaration that he's taking off the issue of Jerusalem from the table of negotiations he is deciding unilaterally what Israel once and he still wants us to come to the table which is empty he wants us to come to the table that is empty because he already notified the possibility of discussion about settlements about borders and now he's taking off Jerusalem off the table that is of course not but it shows how biased this American administration is to Israel although of money really that that decisions been pretty universally disagreed with so suppose you're going to take some heart from that nevertheless you still want money from from America or no no we don't let me explain why the main beneficiary from the money that is coming to Palestinian Authority is Israel you might be surprised about that but most of that money goes to funding security cooperation with Israel and Israel is in need for that security cooperation not Palestinians and more than that let me tell you that the other money that they spend on NGOs is you lose about fifty percent of it which goes back to the United States in the form of administration administrative expenses just make this little a we are not dependent does the money come directly to the Palestinian Authority or no it does but big part of it is devoted to security cooperation to security needs of Israel and more than that let me explain we are not dependent on foreign aid as a matter of fact the total amount of money that is coming from Europe from the states and from Arab countries is no more than sixteen percent of the budget of the Palestinian Authority while the public Palestinians are paying with their taxes eighty four percent of the cost of the Palestinian Authority in my opinion taking away that money is not is not going to affect us seriously so he can take it away but what would affect the Palestinians badly is his plan to cut off support to UNRWA which is a United Nations agency that is providing humanitarian aid in the form of education and health care to Palestinian refugees were ethnically cleansed by Israel from their homeland Palestine and in my opinion now the international community has to step in and replace the American funding because you cannot allow a collapse of humanitarian needs in refugee camps all over the world is that likely to happen anytime soon the rest the community read the world steps in to replace these missing funds they should because this is a UN mission and it's an un obligation that is determined by you and resolutions it's about refugees and the world cannot turn its back to the needs of these refugees till they have the right to come back home and they will not come back home soon because mr. Trump is emptying the table and still demands that Palestinians come to that empty table yeah as we say as we head into a new year now where do we stand on negotiations on one hand we got trouble saying you're not going to have any more money the Palestinians because you don't want to negotiate you say yeah we want to negotiate but because Trump saying Jerusalem's off the table they ain't gonna happen where is it going to go over the next 12 months and will it be more protests there is no way that the United States can play a role of a mediator under mr. Trump mr. Trump and his administration and his invoice on the issue of palestinian-israeli issues have shown that they are totally and completely biased to Israel you cannot be biased to one side and play the role of a mediator actually he's playing the role of a bias partner to Israel and Israel is using them to pressure the Palestinians if we want a real peace process it has to be within an international forum with parties that are impartial parties that respect international law which mr. Trump is now violating by imposing facts unilaterally about Jerusalem and participating in violating that international law mr. Fogarty general secretary the Palestinian national initiative Thank You Fatah will be live or not international
