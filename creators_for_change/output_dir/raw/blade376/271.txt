in fragile x are mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> declines and right</font>

2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:12,880
now my heart Quivers frail demise with

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,309
so much going for me it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not truly</font>

4
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,099
what I want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be no one understands</font>

5
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,930
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would take for me to be free</font>

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,029
patience is a virtue by question if this

7
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,430
be true because it must take place from

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,480
both perspectives for all 253 of giving

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you time all time that was mine and</font>

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,980
there is still so much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than can be</font>

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,600
spent on making things by

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,170
before I surround us continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grow</font>

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,110
and flower the yet to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you are yet</font>

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,240
to understand that until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take my</font>

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,850
hand I will keep you forever by my side

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,120
and together we shall feed the tide<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,220
all these things the world froze ass we

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,400
must keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the trust if finally we are</font>

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look to the ground our potential</font>

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,810
failure would be found humans are

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,490
special because they exploit intentional

22
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,320
action so let's not give destiny in

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,590
undesirable reaction let our spirits<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the path free and allow ourselves to</font>

25
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,630
become one melody and finally we begin

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,119
to leave this same progress the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

27
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:29,380
happiness will reconvene the forest

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,720
around us has stopped to grow as your

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,330
faintness<font color="#CCCCCC"> destroyed the moments that you</font>

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,920
said you would take my hand because

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too fucked up to understand</font>

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have been pushed down to the lowest of</font>

33
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,820
low my heart annihilated by your<font color="#CCCCCC"> tide so</font>

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,950
with all this that was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,840
what the world throws at us it was you

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,080
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> along who would be as this trust now</font>

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,909
without even taking a look to the ground

38
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,460
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential failure has been found</font>

39
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,409
humans are special because they exploit

40
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,340
intentional action

41
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,229
and you've proved this right<font color="#E5E5E5"> such sick</font>

42
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,570
satisfaction so now I leave this<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

43
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">free after all you've done to me with</font>

44
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,609
blackened melody and I finally leave

45
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,410
this scene but still wishing it could

46
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,230
have been you and I with happiness that

47
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,860
reconvenes such bitter bones have been

48
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,650
left alone because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow between us</font>

49
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,430
there echoes a different time I nice

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,040
situations can heal when the concerns

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,209
existing are so real just please dig

52
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,950
deep and tell me what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel</font>

53
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,180
I forgive my<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget whilst I green live</font>

54
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,569
and regret all because in all situations

55
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,590
my heart has one big effect I reach out

56
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,319
so unsure of how much more I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can endure</font>

57
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,139
I'm overwhelmed with these emotions I'm

58
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:57,340
so desperate for a cure just look into

59
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,650
my eyes and see no despise I now realize

60
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,099
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing left to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is crying</font>

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:00:00,000
you
