1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430
screw do my stretches before vlogging oh

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,930
my job has a hole in it you just hear

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,210
that that was so now hi guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in my</font>

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,440
last video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked a little bit about</font>

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,420
community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I feel like this is</font>

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,340
our time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we should just go for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,500
and rule the world and that was pretty

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,449
much what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spoke about in the comments</font>

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,560
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was loads of really great comments</font>

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,369
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

11
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,050
everyone had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say and whether or not</font>

12
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,730
they felt like they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> included in the</font>

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,430
this is our time sentiment of everything

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,810
but there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one comment in particular</font>

15
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,670
stood out for me from<font color="#CCCCCC"> some good Emily</font>

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,170
Emily's comment was also given quite a

17
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,969
few thumbs up so I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a few</font>

18
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,649
people really shared and agreed with

19
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,090
what she had to say which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she</font>

20
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,590
understood that communities are good and

21
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,239
useful and important but that you're not

22
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever taught how to build a community no</font>

23
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,420
one ever talks about that no one ever

24
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,340
talks about the creation of community

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,570
and that's what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

26
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,219
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think a lot of it is about</font>

27
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,770
reframing your perspective on the people

28
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,960
around you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also on communities as a</font>

29
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,550
whole when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say building a community</font>

30
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,770
from scratch in a way something in my

31
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,329
head goes to pulling people from all

32
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,980
sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> places putting them</font>

33
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,260
together and somehow making them all gel

34
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get along and be fabulously</font>

35
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,840
productive I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,489
necessarily that although that works in

37
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,689
some senses I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

38
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,060
residential communities are built up by

39
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,860
having that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that attracts people</font>

40
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,270
to that community whether that's

41
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,909
necessity or luxury<font color="#E5E5E5"> or proximity but in</font>

42
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,189
creative communities I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the central</font>

43
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,920
Central thing to it is collaboration and

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,110
openness to collaboration i would say

45
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all of you already exists within</font>

46
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,850
creative communities communities that

47
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,409
have the potential to support you and

48
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do and communities that</font>

49
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,400
have the potential to grow further into

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,170
what you need them to be even more and

51
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,970
until something that you can give back

52
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,700
to collaboration and giving back you

53
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,960
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with me because you</font>

54
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,729
might say rosianna basically you've read

55
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,590
this book about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boy wizard then you</font>

56
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,700
made videos about him on the internet

57
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,860
and then other people made videos as

58
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,450
well and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to Harry Potter</font>

59
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,460
conventions and now you're all friends

60
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you help each other out like that's</font>

61
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,030
very specific situation and yes there is

62
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,979
quite a specific situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think</font>

63
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of what's made our communities so</font>

64
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,229
successful is the openness about being

65
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,000
creative people and wanting to

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">collaborate our enthusiasm to</font>

67
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,360
collaborate with one another another

68
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,008
thing that's made<font color="#CCCCCC"> its so successful is</font>

69
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,959
respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each other and respect for</font>

70
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other's creations and a genuine</font>

71
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,250
desire to support

72
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,320
which is of course built on this

73
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,030
foundation of friendship but I would

74
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,770
also say that outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the YouTube</font>

75
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,960
community and the harry potter community

76
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,940
and the writing community<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

77
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,590
communities with my friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

78
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">university and secondary school we take</font>

79
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,270
everything from medicine to economics to

80
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,760
draw graffiti<font color="#E5E5E5"> maths but again you have</font>

81
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,650
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to teach me and i have</font>

82
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,180
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach them and the problem</font>

83
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,290
is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people start to talk about</font>

84
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,780
networks and building your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network as</font>

85
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,760
has been the case especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

86
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,430
past five years even more so now that we

87
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,260
have things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> linkedin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now that</font>

88
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,820
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like business cards and websites</font>

89
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,640
are really accessible network or contact

90
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't necessarily mean collaborator a</font>

91
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,590
member of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> or contact isn't</font>

92
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,330
necessarily a friend it isn't

93
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,560
necessarily someone you're looking to

94
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,690
help out more than they're not it's

95
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,730
framed as someone you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of use to</font>

96
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">achieve something you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve</font>

97
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,390
rather than necessarily thinking of how

98
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,980
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help them there's something</font>

99
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about networks and networking that is</font>

100
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,150
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of selfish and it's better to the</font>

101
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,280
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to get somewhere and</font>

102
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,290
if you if you want to push your career

103
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,209
forward you have to be ambitious you

104
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,799
have to be competitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be</font>

105
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,870
ruthless you have to use people and

106
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">although I do think it's important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

107
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,660
we're teaching people to be bold and

108
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,670
make brave choices and that risks

109
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,980
sometimes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right option and</font>

110
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,390
telling women especially that there's

111
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,519
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with really really wanting</font>

112
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,350
something telling them that the root of

113
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,769
that is an independent competitive

114
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,780
mindset that just shuts out everyone

115
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,530
else is completely the wrong approach

116
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,090
collaboration and awareness of how

117
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,670
collaboration is everywhere is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

118
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,350
to our success so how does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

119
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,880
when you're looking to build a community

120
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,920
well first I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's any</font>

121
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,959
such thing as from scratch I think

122
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already part of communities</font>

123
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,320
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find these communities and you</font>

124
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,940
can start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people that you</font>

125
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,130
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> would influence you positively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

126
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,600
that you think you could work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with on</font>

127
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube you can find them in forums you</font>

128
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,850
can find them at free lectures at

129
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,680
universities or page lectures at

130
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,799
universities you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them at craft</font>

131
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,560
fairs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Industry fairs you can find my</font>

132
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,418
coffee shops you can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them when</font>

133
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:18,290
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the hand dryer</font>

134
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,970
work in the bathroom but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

135
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,490
become part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same community</font>

136
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,200
talking talking can be scary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

137
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,550
saying it necessarily has to be with

138
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,400
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice although</font>

139
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,810
do you think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is great merit and</font>

140
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,790
being able to talk over your ideas with

141
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,639
someone by voice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology news you</font>

142
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,889
can now also reach out and build very

143
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,720
solid communities through text I mean

144
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,430
that's a big part of what youtubers as

145
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,009
well but it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to this</font>

146
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,850
participating in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community is</font>

147
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,100
building a community it's participating

148
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,870
and building on that existing community

149
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,000
and it's participating and building a

150
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,889
new community as well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

151
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,199
breakdown or a step-by-step that doesn't

152
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,020
involve boy wizards and chants and

153
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube competitions and being lucky and</font>

154
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,050
also sometimes working<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard and</font>

155
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,750
working with so many people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

156
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,610
do have is a history of participation

157
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,050
but we do have so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different tools</font>

158
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,030
