1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,150
“You don’t have the
answer to the questions,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,150
where did you come from?

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,470
What is life all about?

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,970
Where are you
going when you die?

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,720
You don’t have
those answers yet.

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,300
You can find it tonight.”

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,750
Billy Graham is probably the
most important evangelist

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,090
of the 20th century, even
though American history

9
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,270
is populated with prominent
Christian preachers who were

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,400
pivotal figures in their times.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,060
But Billy Graham combined
his personal magnetism

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,850
and his clear message
with the foresight

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,240
to make use of modern
communications technologies.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,180
Everything from
television to satellite

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,440
uplinks to the internet.

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,450
“— of God’s mighty love.

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,360
When I go abroad, I don’t go
as an ambassador of the United

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,750
States, I go as an ambassador
of the king of kings and Lord

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,590
of Lords.”

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,050
Billy Graham pioneered
global crusades,

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,750
and his sermons were
transmitted simultaneously

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,055
into dozens of languages —

23
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,975
“Be repentant of
your sins before.”

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,970
— and transmitted by satellite
to hundreds of countries.

25
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,250
So he had a global reach.

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,900
“Christianity is not a
white man’s religion,

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,330
and don’t let anybody ever tell
you that it’s white or black.

28
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,620
Christ belongs to all people.”

29
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,210
Billy Graham was not only
charismatic and telegenic,

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,720
but he understood that no
matter how large the crowd,

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,840
he had to move each man
and woman there personally.

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,790
“Is your heart right?”

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,430
And he would speak in a
way that was accessible.

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,890
“— be Lord of your eyes,
Lord of your ears —”

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,840
People who attended
Billy Graham crusades

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,970
would often say
afterward, I felt like he

37
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,681
was speaking to me personally.

38
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,930
“I’m going to ask you to get
up from your seat if you —”

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,840
Thousands of people,
many first-time converts,

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,590
would stream forward and
be met by representatives

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,290
of local churches, so that
after the crusade was over,

42
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,890
they would have a local
church to be part of.

43
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,650
And in this way, Billy
Graham had a huge impact

44
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,450
on building evangelical
Christianity.

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,940
“The spirit at large comes
to live within you —”

46
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,500
He wasn’t building just his
own movement or his own church.

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,220
He was building Christianity.

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,220
“I’m looking forward
to that day when

49
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,780
I’ll see Christ face to face.

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you?”
