>> WE CAME ACROSS THIS ARTICLE
IN A SAN FRANCISCO PERIODICLE
WHERE THE TERM INDIAN SUMMER MAY
NOT BE USED.
YOU SHOULDN'T USE INDIAN SUMMER.
THE PROBLEM IS THIS.
>> TAKE THOSE DOWN.
>> INDIAN SUMMER MAY HAVE ITS
ORIGIN IN CARGO SHIPS TRAVELING
THE INDIAN OCEAN.
IT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
NATIVE AMERICANS.
>> THERE ARE OTHER WORDS WE CAN
NO LONGER USE.
INDIAN SUMMER, SITTING INDIAN
STYLE, OFF THE RESERVATION.
DON'T SAY OFF THE RESERVATION,
INGRAHAM.
BLACK BALL.
>> BLACK BALL.
I USED THAT TODAY.
>> WHITEWASH.
DON'T USE WHITEWASH, YOU WILL
OFFEND ME.
INMATES RUNNING THE ASYLUM.

EARLIER.
FRESHMAN.

DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN.
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE, DON'T BE
FRESH, MAN.

THE OTHER DAY.

THIS.
>> I DID MY FIRST MOVIE EVER
WITH WHOOPI GOLDBERG, A MOVIE
CALLED "CLARA'S HEART."
SHE TOLD ME -- SHE TOLD ME I WAS
WHAT, 15, 16 YEARS OLD.
SHE TOLD ME ON MY LAST DAY OF
SHOOTING THAT TEN YEARS, IN TEN
YEARS TIME, SHE WAS GOING TO
HAVE SEX WITH ME.
>> I MIGHT HAVE.
IN THOSE DAYS, YOU COULD
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME FUN LIKE
THAT.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT NOW.
>> I WAS NOT OFFENDED.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
>> HAVE SOME FUN LIKE THAT.
>> IMAGINE, IMAGINE IF A YOUNG
FEMALE ACTRESS GOT UP AND SAID
SOME ACADEMY AWARD WINNING
DIRECTOR HAD TOLD HER WHEN SHE
WAS 15 THAT HE WOULD HAVE SEX
WITH HER IN A FEW YEARS, THE
VIEW WOULD BE ASKING FOR THAT
GUY'S HEAD AND PROMISING HE
WOULD NEVER WORK AGAIN.
