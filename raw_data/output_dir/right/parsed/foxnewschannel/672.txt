BY THE END OF THIS YEAR BY
THE WAY WE HAVE MORE THAN
20,000 PEOPLE WORKING ON
SECURITY AND CONTENT REVIEW
WORKING ACROSS ALL THESE
THINGS.
SO, WHEN CONTENT GETS
FLAGGED TO US, WE HAVE THOSE
PEOPLE LOOK AT IT AND IF IT
VIOLATES OUR POLICIES THEN
WE TAKE IT DOWN.
SOLUTIONS THAN OTHERS.
SO, HATE SPEECH IS ONE OF
THE HARDEST.
DETERMINING IF SOMETHING IS
HATE SPEECH IS
LINGUISTICALLY NUANCED.
>> Dana: MARK ZUREG
>> Dana: MARK ZUCEG
>> Dana: MARK ZUCKERBERG
FLAGS HOW SOMETHING IS HATE
SPEECH.
FLAGGED IT AS HATE SPEECH
BEFORE EVENTUALLY RESTORING
IT.
IN A SIMILAR CASE THE GOSPEL
GROUP ZION'S JOY POSTED THIS
INDIVIDUALSIO TO FACEBOOK
PAGE FOR A NEW SONG TITLED
WHAT WOULD HEAVEN LOOK LIKE.
LISTEN.
♪ WHAT WOULD HEAVEN LOOK
LIKE
♪ WHAT WOULD IT BEING LIKE
♪ TELL ME
♪ WHAT WOULD HEAVEN BE.
>> Dana: VIDEO WAS FLAGGED
ON FACEBOOK FOR, QUOTE,
POLITICAL CONTENT AND TAKEN
DOWN.
THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT HAS
SINCE APOLOGIZED TO THE
GROUP SAYING, QUOTE WE MADE
AN ERROR BY DELETING THE
ORIGINAL POST.
AS SOON AS WE IDENTIFIED
WHAT HAPPENED, WE RESTORED
THE POST SINCE IT DOES NOT
VIOLATE OUR COMMUNITY
STANDARDS AND HAVE
APOLOGIZED TO ZION'S JOY.
HERE NOW IS A MEMBER OF THE
CHOIR, ZION'S JOY KAY
ENDSLEY.
>> Dana: TELL US ABOUT THE
SONG AND THE MESSAGE YOU
WERE TRYING TO CONVEY AND
HOW THIS WAS TAKEN DOWN BY
AND IT'S ABOUT UNITY AND
IT'S ABOUT HOPE.
WE WERE INCREDIBLY SHOCKED
WHEN FACEBOOK CAME AND TOOK
THIS SONG, THIS MESSAGE THAT
SO NEEDS TO BE HEARD RIGHT
>> Dana: DID THEY GIVE YOU
ANY INDICATION, I KNOW THEY
HAVE SINCE APOLOGIZED.
I SHOULD ASK YOU IF YOU
ACCEPT THEIR APOLOGY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED
POLITICAL SPEECH WHETHER IT
WAS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
OR A HUMAN THAT MADE THAT
DECISION?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE ACTUALLY AREN'T FOR SURE.
THE ISSUE HAPPENED WHEN WE
TRIED TO BOOST IT
NATIONALLY.
AND IT WAS POLITICAL
CONTENT.
WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION FOR
THIS.
I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE
FACEBOOK VIDEO.
WE WERE SO EXCITED.
WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SOME
POSITIVE REVIEWS AND
FEEDBACK FROM THIS FROM SO
MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE
NATION.
AND SO I WANTED TO SEE WHAT
IT, I NOTICED THAT IT WAS
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND,
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN
OFF.
>> Dana: SO THEN YOU
CONTACTED FACEBOOK AND
THAT'S WHEN THEY LOOKED INTO
IT?
>> WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A
SOLUTION FOR THIS SCENARIO.
SO WE HAD BEEN TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT THE POLITICAL
CONTENT ISSUE AND THEY NEVER
GAVE US A REASONING FOR WHY
THEY TOOK IT OFF.
SO WE STARTED TO KIND OF DO
SOME RESEARCH ON THAT AND
TRY TO FIGURE OUT, BUT WE
NEVER GOT AN ANSWER.
>> Dana: SO DO YOU HAVE
ADVICE FOR ANYBODY ELSE THAT
MAY FIND THEMSELF CAUGHT UP
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND
HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET FACEBOOK TO RESTORE
IT AND OFFER AN APOLOGY?
BET IS JUST TO TRY YOUR BEST
TO REACH OUT TO ALL OF YOUR
SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE
TO YOU, WHETHER THAT IS NUT
WE WANT THE POSITIVITY AS
MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO BE OUT
IN THE FOREFRONT.
>> Dana: I WANTED TO ASK YOU
IS FACEBOOK STILL THE BEST
WAY FOR YOU TO DO THAT?
>> I THINK IT IS AT THIS
MOMENT IN TIME.
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT IT
CONTINUES TO BE.
>> Dana: AND THEN WHAT DO
YOU HAVE NEXT FOR YOU?
IT'S BACK UP.
WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE?
HAVE YOU SOME RECOGNITION
NOW.
IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
LISTEN TO YOU, WHAT MORE
WILL THEY FIND OUT?
>> RIGHT.
WELL, THEY ARE JUST GOING TO
FIND A POSITIVE MESSAGE.
WE HAVE SOME AMAZING PEOPLE
IN THIS GROUP AND WE DO SO
MANY OUTREACHES.
NOT ONLY LOCALLY IN
INDIANAPOLIS BUT AROUND THE
NATION.
WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO
MINISTER AT A DRUG REHAB
FACILITY THE BEGINNING OF
AUGUST IN THE BALTIMORE
PLACE.
WE INVITE PEOPLE TO COME BE
A PART OF WHAT WE ARE DOING.
AND THE POSITIVITY THAT WE
ARE SPREADING NOT ONLY
LOCALLY BUT REALLY TRYING TO
PURSUE AROUND THE WORLD.
WE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY
THANKFUL FOR THIS
OPPORTUNITY.
SOMETHING THAT WAS NEGATIVE
HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A
POSITIVE AND NOW WE ARE
HAVING THE ABILITY TO GET
OUR MESSAGE OUT EVEN MORE
I LOVE YOUR MUSIC.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
ON THE SHOW WE ARE GLAD YOUR
