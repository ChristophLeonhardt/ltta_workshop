well folks were on the israel-lebanon border and I'm with array Ben Yaakov and what a story array you were born in Cleveland in 1940 then in 1961 you decide leaving America coming to Israel why did you do that and what was what was it like that the culture change well first of all it wasn't a big culture change because I'm Jewish and I came to the home of the Jewish people so there's not a big culture change for me basically I looked around at my life in America and I said oh this is boring there's got to be something else and I realized that here's a chance by coming to Israel of being an an integral part of history creating our home again for the first time in two thousand years was a real bonus to my making meaning to my life otherwise I there was nothing to do just you know another person living and yet by the this-this-this gave me soul food and yet by the same token as you said earlier off-camera this isn't Disneyland to the South here that that is a Lebanese village a very nice house is funded by Iran and this is Hezbollah territory I noticed you carry a sidearm so as you live on the the caboose here you have to always be aware of this clear and present danger do you not absolutely absolutely but that's good keeps us on our toes we don't get soft we don't get lazy yeah you know I'm into that I guess is your philosophy then peace through strength because absolutely we are not intimidated we're not afraid we're not here by your leave sir we're not victims we're not cheap you mess with us we're gonna kick your ass and you have been messed with and you have had to do some ass-kicking haven't you lutely and if we need it again I'll do it again people ask me don't you want peace yeah but not at any price you know the truth is that our neighbors don't want peace so why I don't see any reason to deal with them and tell me sir what do you make of the United name United Nations patrols I think you referred to the museum nothing's here's an example you see that helicopter yes sir that's a UN helicopter they fly by here four times a day on the Lebanese side who we don't want him they photograph and they fly back now why do you call them the United nothing so as they're totally useless they don't do anything when was the last time the UN saved anybody not in the Balkans not anywhere where UN doesn't they're very ineffectual as as an army as a military force they're totally useless and what do you make of the world media the way they frame that the conflict around Israel it seems to us to be so one-sided especially when you come to Israel and you see what the reality is what is your impression especially as someone who used to live in America my impression is this I don't know if I'm right but it sounds good to me so I'll tell you what I think the world is not used to the Jewish people kicking ass and being sovereign they're used to us being in ghettos and being oppressed than being this and being that make they can't get their head around the fact that we are serious and we're here and there's no stopping us and so anti-semitism is alive and well and part of the reason is they don't see us as sovereign people and nations and that's the same because we are and we're here and we're not going anywhere the dichotomy is that when you look at Israel it's this island of tolerance and democracy and freedom in a sea of oppression and you would think the predominately left-wing countries and left-wing media would espouse those values that are you know celebrated in Israel but and this is the nut I can't quite crack I know I can't either the only thing I put it up to is there's a God and he runs things and this is what he wants and he wants us here and he wants the rest of the world to be mad at us and I figure as long as everybody's mad at us we must be doing something right so I don't care what other people you know and one last question despite the pressure despite the propaganda campaigns despite the indoctrination of others to vilify Israel I take it your message is that you aren't going anywhere are you no and as the future goes on we'll just get bigger and stronger nothing to do guys lump it well folks many of your favorite rebel personalities are right here in Israel and if you want to keep up to date with our reports please go to rebel Israel calm to get all the latest from the Holy Land
