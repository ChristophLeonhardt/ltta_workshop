Virginia state troopers were in a car chase that they're gonna be talking about probably or ever if you haven't seen this video it's absolutely fascinating it's happened right outside Richmond Virginia where a soldier now known to be a lieutenant in the Army National Guard Virginia Army National Guard his name hasn't been released but he's been arrested he surrendered to police around 9:40 p.m. hook Virginia state police on a high-speed car chase it really wasn't a car that he was driving he was driving an m5 77 armored vehicle and it's a command post it's built on the m113 and it's a like a mobile command post it's impervious it's slightly armored impervious to small arms fire high speed it was about 40 miles per hour and you can see the Virginia State Police giving this thing a wide berth in the video which is probably a really good idea but they say the soldier was from Fort plick Pickett in Blackstone Virginia he'd been drove this thing at 40 miles an hour being pursued by the Virginia State Police and eventually Richmond city of Richmond PD and he drove it into the city of Richmond and like I said her at 9:40 p.m. he just pulled over and gave himself up now he's an officer assigned to an engineering battalion he holds the rank of lieutenant we don't know anything else about the guy but geez so now this is an older piece of equipment equipment like this is being phased out for the Regular Army it's been in use and it's about to be it Nam war which is typically the kind of equipment that excuse me National Guard troops yet from wvt are the CBS affiliate in the area he's surrendered the vehicles stopped at East Broad Street in 11th Street in the city of Richmond he surrendered to the Virginia Virginia State Police when he pulled this armored personnel carrier over now it's important note this was not an armed vehicle the vehicle didn't have any guns on it has no hands guns anything like that so short of him driving this vehicle which was 11.6 tons of 40 miles an hour's pretty fast there was never any other risk to the public of him firing any kind of weapon heavier weapon light weapon anything like that again they say he lives in the area he's a commander with an engineering battalion and the Army has confirmed it was an m5 7-7 the National Guard people who saw this I mean the research is pretty funny but the witness who saw it said quotes guy named Brian winger - lives in the area it just seemed like something out of a movie I heard a large vehicle it sounded like a tank but it was moving pretty fast a charges are pending against the driver while the investigation continues he's gonna probably lose his commission be booted out of Army and I'm sure it charged criminally for this why he would do this is anybody's guess he's absolutely bizarre it's interesting I wish I had chased an armored personnel carrier and I was a cop I didn't the most unusual call I ever had nonviolent call was a horse got loose in the Bronx on the Grand Concourse was very busy a lot of cops I worked with a grow up in the city and I had actually I was familiar with horses I always rode I have a horse now and was able to mentally calm the horse down get him out of traffic with some food get his bridle get him back in the horse carrier me and the driver the horse carrier but yeah that was about the most unusual nonviolent crime call I had and police work I believe or state troopers it's often hours and hours of Boreham a troopers patrolling these rural roads and pulling people over it's hours and hours of boredom some nights and then you get that moment of excitement not the moment of Terror sometimes a moment of sadness this was of excitement and probably a what hmm moment and believe me these cops are gonna be out drinking these troopers laughing about this for a long time to come now we can laugh about it because nobody got hurt but this was nearly a 12-ton a twenty four thousand pound vehicle traveling at 40 miles an hour that's a lot of kinetic energy right there thank god this thing didn't hit a home hit a vehicle it would have killed anybody it came in contact with and it hit a vehicle it would have crushed the occupants airbags wouldn't mattered with a vehicle like this had it crashed in a home or an open business we'd have seen many many casualties most likely serious injuries fatalities so we could joke about it now that everybody was okay great job by the Virginia State Police local police in Richmond for giving this thing a wide berth and getting the guy to slow down pull over and surrender but you know I wish I had been able to chase Norman vehicle I think it would have been providing an ended like this with no injuries would have been a lot of fun and a good war story to tell for a lot of years go to the App Store download the rebel app as always thank you so much for watching I'll see you tomorrow you
