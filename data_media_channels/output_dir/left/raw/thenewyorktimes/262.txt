00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,900
Sacramento police released
video of the shooting death

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,730
of Stephon Clark, who was shot
by police in his backyard.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,930
He was unarmed.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,040
Here’s what police body camera
and helicopter footage shows.

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,120
Eight minutes later, officers arrive
at a house in the area.

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,580
At this point, it's unclear
where the suspect is.

7
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,210
Moments later, the helicopter
alerts the officers

8
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,140
that they’ve spotted
an individual.

9
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,960
This is 22-year-old
Stephon Clark.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,224
They run to Clark’s home.

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,450
The officers spot Clark.

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,690
At this moment, Clark moves
toward the officers.

13
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,255
“Show me your hands!
Gun, gun, gun!”

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,830
Then Clark drops to his
hands and knees.

15
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,660
They continue to fire.

16
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,060
Two minutes and
50 seconds later,

17
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,060
the officers try to
communicate with Clark.

18
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,297
Five minutes after the last
bullet, they go check on him.

19
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,140
There was a cellphone
next to Clark’s body.

20
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,120
No guns were found.

21
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,570
Officers involved have been
put on paid leave as district

22
00:02:12,570 --> 00:00:00,000
and city attorneys investigate.
