>> I THINK IT WOULD BE
PROPER TO DELAY THE FLOOR
VOTE FOR UP TO BUT NOT MORE
THAN ONE WEEK IN ORDER TO
LET THE FBI CONTINUE -- TO
DO AN INVESTIGATION, LIMITED
IN TIME AND SCOPE TO THE
CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE
THERE.
>> I THINK HE SHOWED COURAGE
AND DETERMINATION TODAY IN
NOT MOVE
MAKING IT PUBLIC THAT I WILL
NOT MOVING AHEAD WITH A
FINAL VOTE ON THE FLOOR
UNLESS THERE IS A BRIEF FBI
INVESTIGATION.
>> I'M GOING TO LET THE
SENATE HANDLE THAT, THEY
WILL MAKE THEIR DECISIONS
AND THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A
GOOD JOB.
SO SIGHTS AND SOUNDS FROM
THIS DELAY AN FBI
INVESTIGATION INTO JUDGE
KAVANAUGH PART OF THE
STIPULATIONS THAT ARIZONA
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE MADE JUST
MOMENTS AGO, THE SENATE
MAJORITY LEADER TAKING TO
THE FLOOR.
>> THIS IS A NOMINATION THAT
DESERVES TO MOVE FORWARD AND
THAT IS PRECISELY,
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT IS
HAPPENING.
I COMMEND OUR COLLEAGUES ON
THE COMMITTEE FOR SENDING
THIS IMPRESSIVE NOMINEE HERE
TO THE FLOOR WITH FAVORABLE
RECOMMENDATION.
NOW WE WILL KEEP THE PROCESS
MOVING, THE FULL SENATE WILL
BEGIN CONSIDERING JUDGE
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION
TODAY.
>> Bret: SO JUST
INTERPRETING THERE, THEY ARE
STARTING THE CLOCK.
AND THE THE SENATE PROCESS,
WHICH IS SOMETIMES ARCANE
STARTS AND THEN WHEN THE FBI
INVESTIGATION IS FINISHED,
THEY WILL BE READY TO VOTE
ON THE FLOOR.
LET'S BRING IN THE PANEL
BILL BENNETT FORMER
EDUCATION SECRETARY, MOLLIE
HELPINGWAY SENIOR EDITOR AT
"THE FEDERALIST."
AMY SENIOR FELLOW AT THE
MANHATTAN INSTITUTE.
OKAY, BILL, THOUGHTS ON THIS
DAY AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
OVER THE PAST DAY AND A
HALF.
>> STEADY, CALM, STATESMAN
LIKE PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE
COME TO KNOW.
RIGHT?
VERY COOL, EVERYBODY WAS
WAITING FOR HIM TO ABRUPT
LIKE, HE DIDN'T.
HE MAY YET.
DEPENDING ON HOW THIS THING
TURNS OUT.
LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS BECOME
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
DEPARTMENT EXPLAINING
POLITICAL SCIENCE TO
AND HE SPLANTD TO
AND HE EPLANTD TO
AND HE EXPANTD TO
AND HE EXPLATD TO
AND HE EXPLAIN TO
AND HE EXPLAINEDO
DEMOCRATS AND TO THE PUBLIC.
AND HE EXPLAINED TO THE
DEMOCRATS TODAY IF YOU WIN
ELECTIONS YOU GET TO PICK
THE NOMINEES TO THE SUPREME
COURT.
I'M SORRY, GUYS WE WON THIS
ELECTION.
ANOTHER LESSON TODAY, WHICH
IS THAT IF YOU WIN THE
SENATE BY ONLY ONE OR TWO
VOTES, HAVE YOU TO BE ABLE
TO COUNT AND HAVE TO BE
WILLING TO DO THINGS LIKE
THIS WEEK.
I DON'T THINK MUCH DAMAGE
WILL BE DONE PROVIDED ITS
LIMITED.
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE WILL ASK
FOR AN EXTENSION, YEAH,
RIGHT.
I THINK IT'S OKAY.
I ONLY FEEL BADLY FOR THE
JUDGE.
ANOTHER TERRIBLE WEEK FOR
HIM AND THERE WILL BE SOME
CRAZINESS.
>> Bret: A.B., IT REALLY IS
JUST NUMBERS HERE.
IF THEY HAD TWO MORE
SENATORS WHO WERE READY TO
SIGN ON, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
TO HAVE THIS OVER A BARREL
SITUATION.
>> THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS IS
JUST THE POLITICAL REALITY
HAS FORCED THEM INTO THIS
CORNER TO PROVIDE THE FBI
INVESTIGATION AND AN
ADDITIONAL WEEK.
THAT SAID, IT IS GOING TO
HELP THE SENATE, IT'S GOING
TO HELP THE COURT, IT'S
GOING TO HELP JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AND IT'S GOING TO
HELP THE COUNTRY IF THIS
CONCLUDES IN A CLEANER, MORE
COMPREHENSIVE WAY, A LESS
DIVISIVE PROCESS.
AND I JUST THINK AN FBI
INVESTIGATION COULD HAVE
BEEN CONCLUDED BY NOW IF IT
WERE ALLOWED 10 DAYS AGO.
I THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY TO
SWEAR HIM ONTO THE BENCH OF
THE SUPREME COURT IF THAT'S
WHAT THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO
BE.
HE NEEDS THIS REMOVED FROM
HIM BEFORE HIS TENURE THERE.
>> Bret: MOLLIE?
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT THE
REAL REASON WHY PEOPLE WERE
ASKING FOR AN FBI
INVESTIGATION WAS THAT THEY
WERE JUST TRYING TO DELAY
THE PROCESS.
THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH
HAVING AN FBI INVESTIGATION
AT THIS POINT.
AND THERE WERE MANY THINGS
THAT HAPPENED THAT ARE GOOD
FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO
SEE BRETT KAVANAUGH SEATED
ON THE SUPREME COURT.
IT GOT OUT OF COMMITTEE
TODAY.
THAT WAS HUGE.
IT GOT OUT OF COMMITTEE WITH
JEFF FLAKE SAYING IS HE
GOING TO VOTE YES PENDING
THIS RETURN OF THIS
INVESTIGATION.
AND THE FBI INVESTIGATION
ITSELF ACTUALLY HAS FEWER
INVESTIGATORY TOOLS THAN THE
SENATE HAS.
THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPEL
TESTIMONY.
WE ALREADY KNOW WHO ALL THE
PLAYERS ARE THEY HAVE
ALREADY GIVEN STATEMENTS.
IT SHOULD NOT TAKE LONG IT
ONLY TOOK A COUPLE DAYS TO
INVESTIGATE THE ANITA HILL
SITUATION.
ONLY TOOK A COUPLE DAYS TO
INVESTIGATE ANTHONY WEINER'S
LAPTOP.
CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO TAKE
MORE THAN A COUPLE DAYS TO
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.
THIS PUBLIC APPETITE FOR
DELAY, DELAY, DELAY.
I CAN'T FLY.
OH, WE CAN'T FLY WITH THIS
IS GONE.
SO, IT JUST HAS TO HAPPEN
NOW.
AND WHEN IT COMES BACK, I
THINK WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.
>> Bret: IS THERE A
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT ANY
ONE OF THOSE DEMOCRATS ON
THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE AFTER AN FBI IF IT
COMES BACK CLEARING HIS NAME
IS GOING TO SOMEHOW VOTE FOR
JUDGE KAVANAUGH?
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE.
THESE ARE REDUNDANT
INVESTIGATIONS.
INTENDED TO DELAY THE VOTE.
NOT TO SEEK THE TRUTH AS TO
WHAT DID OR DID NOT HAPPEN.
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF
THE BAD FAITH THAT THE
DEMOCRATS ARE ARGUING HERE,
SHORTLY AFTER -- ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
REPUBLICANS AGREED TO AN FBI
INVESTIGATION, SENATOR CHRIS
MURPHY OF CONNECTICUT, A
DEMOCRAT SENATOR, TWEETED.
THIS.
HE SAID OF COURSE THERE
SHOULD BE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION BUT WHATEVER
THEY FIND DOESN'T CHANGE THE
FACT THAT KAVANAUGH,
ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS
PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY IS THE
MOST DANGEROUS SUPREME COURT
PICK OF OUR LIFETIME.
DEMOCRATS HAVE ALREADY COME
OUT AND SAID A WEEK?
HOW CAN WE GET THIS DONE IN
A WEEK?
THIS IS NOT ABOUT SEEKING
THE TRUTH, BRET.
IT IS SIMPLY TO RIDE OUT THE
CLOCK HERE TO RUN OUT THE
CLOCK.
>> Bret: ALL RIGHT.
SO LET'S SAY IN THE ELECTION
COMING UP HOW DOES THIS
PLAY?
YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO
SAID THEY SUPPORT THIS FBI
INVESTIGATION.
HEIDI HEITKAMP AND JOE
MANCHIN.
TRUMP WON NORTH DAKOTA BY
35.7%.
WEST VIRGINIA BY 42.2%.
THEY ARE LOOKING, OBVIOUSLY,
AT RACES MAYBE MORE HEITCAMP
THAN MANCHIN, HOW DOES THIS
PLAY NOT ONLY WITH THIS
DELAY BUT ALSO FOR WOMEN WHO
DO LOOK AT DR. BLASEY FORD
WHO SAY I SEE SOMEONE WHO
CAME UP AND TOLD HER STORY?
>> ARE YOU ASKING ME ABOUT
WOMEN?
>> Bret: YEAH.
>> I DON'T THINK WE ARE
ALLOWED TO COMMENT ANYMORE.
>> Bret: I'M GOING TO ASK
YOU TO, HOLD ON.
>> I THINK IN THE CASE OF A
WOMAN, HEIDI HEITKAMP, I
THINK IF SHE LOOKS AT THE
NUMBERS AND IS FAIR SHE WILL
END UP SUPPORTING, IF
NOTHING ELSE COMES OUT ONLY
THING THAT WILL COME OUT IS
MORE CRAZINESS OUT OF THE
WOODWORK, THEN SHE MAY WELL
SUPPORT HIM AS WILL MANCHIN.
I THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE IT
COULD HEAL TO SOME EXTENT
WHAT A.B. SAID.
ALSO ON THE SAME TIME A PART
OF THE THE DEMOCRATS A
REUSE.
WHAT DOES ONE WEEK GET THEM?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE WEEK
GETS THEM.
THEY WOULD HAVE TO EXTEND IT
FURTHER, WEREN'T THEY.
>> YOU ARE ASSUMING THAT'S
THEIR PLAN TO PUSH IT PAST
THE MID TERMS.
YOU CAN'T TAKE SENATOR COONS
AT HIS WORD?
HE ASKED FOR A WEEK.
>> I GUESS I CAN'T.
>> WOMEN BELIEVE IN DUE
PROCESS THEY HAVE HUSBANDS
AND SONS AND BROTHERS.  BRET
LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
TODAY ON THIS TESTIMONY AND
ON DR. FORD.
>> I FEEL THAT HER TESTIMONY
WAS VERY COMPELLING.
AND SHE LOOKS LIKE A VERY
FINE WOMAN TO ME.
VERY FINE WOMAN.
TESTIMONY,
THSTIMONY,
THATIMONY,
THAT BONY,
THAT BREY,
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WS
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WL
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WK
AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT'S
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WE
SOMETHING I HADN'T SEEN
BEFORE.
IT WAS INCREDIBLE MOMENT, I
THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR
COUNTRY.
BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY
CREDIBLE WITNESS.
SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY
RESPECTS.
I JUST WANT IT TO WORK OUT
WELL FOR THE COUNTRY.
IF THAT HAPPENS, I'M HAPPY.
>> Bret: MOLLIE?
>> SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND
DR. FORD CREDIBLE.
OTHER PEOPLE WILL NOT.
THAT'S WHY IN THIS COUNTRY
WE GO WITH WHAT EVIDENCE IS,
NOT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT
SOMEONE BUT WHETHER YOU HAVE
PROVIDED THE EVIDENCE TO
DESTROY A MAN'S LIFE AND TO
DESTROY HIS CAREER AND I
JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT
JASON SAID, WHICH IS WOMEN
ARE NOT SOME MONOLITHIC
BLOCK.
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS
ABOUT THINGS.
JUST BECAUSE WE ARE WOMEN
DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION OR
DUE PROCESS OR RULE OF LAW.
WE ALSO JUST CARE VERY
DEEPLY AS PEOPLE WHO LOVE
MEN, WHO LOVE OUR HUSBANDS
AND OUR FATHERS AND OUR
BROTHERS AND OUR SONS.
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A
COUNTRY WHERE YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR LIFE DESTROYED WITHOUT
HAVING EVIDENCE TO DESTROY
SOMEONE'S LIFE.
>> TWO SEPARATE CREDIBILITY
QUESTIONS I THINK ARE BEING
COLLAPSED INTO ONE.
EMOTIONAL CREDIBILITY AND
FACTUAL CREDIBILITY.
EMOTIONALLY, THEY WERE BOTH
CREDIBLE, SEEMS TO ME THEY
WERE BOTH PERSUASIVE.
I GENERALLY BELIEVE SHE
BELIEVES WHAT SHE IS SAYING.
I KNOW BRETT KAVANAUGH
BELIEVES WHAT HE IS SAYING.
IN TERMS OF FACTUAL
CREDIBILITY, THE CASE IS
OVERWHELMINGLY STRONG FOR
KAVANAUGH, AND SHE HAS NO
EVIDENCE, FACTUAL
CREDIBILITY.
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS
PASSED A HALF DOZEN FBI
BACKGROUND CHECKS IN THE
PAST QUARTER CENTURY.
>> Bret: WITHOUT THE
ALLEGATIONS THOUGH.
I GET IT, THE ALLEGATIONS
UNDERSTANDING THE TIMING AND
PROCESS THEY WEREN'T A PART
OF THOSE SIX INVESTIGATIONS.
>> YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY
WORK, YOU WERE ASKED I HAVE
BEEN THROUGH DOZENS OF THEM
AND YOU ARE ASKED IS THERE
ANYTHING IN THIS PERSON'S
BACKGROUND THAT OUGHT TO BE
BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION,
WHICH SUGGESTS INVITATION
WITH PROBLEM OF CHARACTER,
RELIABILITY, DEPENDABILITY,
VIOLATIONS OF LAW.
>> Bret: THERE ARE TWO
SEPARATE THINGS HERE, ONE IS
THE PROCESS THE DEMOCRATS
HAD AND HOW THEY HELD THE
BALL AND FEINSTEIN HAD THE
LETTER THEY COULD HAVE
STARTED THIS PROCESS A LONG
TIME AGO.
THE OTHER IS THE ACTUAL
CREDIBILITY OF THE INCIDENT
IN THE EARLY 1980S, THOSE
ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.
>> IF I I HAVE CRITICISM OF
THE PROCESS THE WAY BOTH
PARTIES HAVE HANDLED IT AND
I THINK YOU CAN CRITICIZE
THE DEMOCRATS IF IN A WEEK
ASK FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION.
BUT THEY HAVE, IN GOOD FAITH
JOINED WITH JEFF FLAKE WHO
HAS GIVEN THEM COVER.
>> YES, HE WAS.
>> GIVEN COLLINS COVER,
MURKOWSKI COVER, DEMOCRATS
IN RED STATES COVER TO BE
ABLE TO VOTE FOR JUDGE
KAVANAUGH BY SAYING THIS WAS
A CLEAN PROCESS.
WOMEN AND MEN OUT THERE
WATCHING THIS TESTIMONY
YESTERDAY AND MILLIONS OF
THEM DID WHO ARE NOT
PARTISANS AND NOT MEMBERS OF
THE POLITICAL DO NOT KNOW
ABOUT JULY 30TH AND SOME
LETTER FROM FEINSTEIN'S
OFFICE.
WHAT THEY LEARNED ABOUT
YESTERDAY IS THERE HASN'T
BEEN AN FBI INVESTIGATION
AND SUBPOENA FOR MARK JUDGE.
THEY HEARD IT ALL DAY LONG.
AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THE
ANSWER TO THAT.
WHICH IS WHY JEFF FLAKE CAME
OUT WITH THIS DEMAND.
IT IS -- IN THE INTEREST OF
HEALING --
>> Bret: DO YOU THINK ANY
DEMOCRATS AT THE END OF A
WEEK WHEN THE FBI COMES BACK
AND SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT
CORROBORATES HER STORY.
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THOSE
DEMOCRATS --
>> -- I THINK HEITKAMP --
SENATOR HEITKAMP AND
MANCHIN.
>> COONS?
ANYBODY ON THE SENATE
JUDICIARY.
>> COONS ALREADY SAID IS HE
VOTING NO AFTER THE HEARING
EXECUTIVE POWER.
>> Bret: KLOBUCHAR.
>> HEALING THE DIVISIONS OF
THE COMMITTEE AND NOT
TRASHING THE SENATE.
THEY ALREADY HAVE COMPLAINTS
ON HIM ON POLICY QUESTION.
>> Bret: THAT'S MY POINT.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT HEALING
THE DIVIDES THAT HAVE
EXPLODED IN THE LAST FEW
DAYS ABOUT THE PROCESS AND
HELPING THE COURT RETAIN ITS
RESPECT AND TRUST IN THIS
COUNTRY AS THE ONLY
INSTITUTION LEFT THAT HAS IT
MY POINT IS LINDSEY GRAHAM
POINTED FOR ALL OF THESE
SENATORS.
>> UNFORTUNATELY THOSE DAYS
ARE DONE I AGREE WITH YOU.
I WISH THIS WAS A BIPARTISAN
PROCESS.
>> BUT THE PRECEDENT IS
IMPORTANT HERE.
THINK OF THE PRESS DENTING
WE ARE SETTING.
ALLEGATIONS DECADES OLD AND
ALLEGATIONS ALONE NONE OF
DR. FORD'S SUPPOSED
WITNESSES CORROBORATE WHAT
SHE IS SAYING AND SEVERAL OF
THEM REFUTE WHAT SHE IS
SAYING.
THINK OF THE PRECEDENCE.
>> I HAVE COMPLAINTS WITH
BOTH PARTIES ABOUT HOW THEY
HAVE HANDLED THE NOMINATION
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
I THINK IT'S IN HIS BEST
INTEREST TO GO THROUGH WITH
THIS AND SEE IT THROUGH
ANOTHER WEEK AND NOT GO
PAST.
>> I THINK THIS WEEK WILL DO
A LOT TO PROVIDE HEALING FOR
THE LEFT.
THE RIGHT WILL NEED HEALING
FROM WHAT THEY SAW THIS MAN
BEING PUT THROUGH.
THAT'S WHAT SOME PEOPLE NEED
THOUGH THINK ABOUT AND ANGER
