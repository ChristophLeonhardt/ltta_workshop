00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:02,270
VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR RULE

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,772

3
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:07,209
OF AMERICA IS IN JEOPARDY.

YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY

7
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,113
GIULIANI.

8
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:12,147
MR. MAYOR, BEFORE YOU TOOK

9
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:16,184
ON THIS POSITION YOU HAD ON

10
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,919
THIS PROGRAM IDENTIFIED

11
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:18,253
CRIMES.

12
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,922
I THINK IT IS

13
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:22,224
EXTRAORDINARILY RELEVANT HOW

14
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:25,994
THE YOU WERE ECHELON IN THE

15
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:26,795
FBI TREATED HILLARY CLINTON

16
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,430
SO SHE COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT

17
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,132
BEING INDICTED AS A

18
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:30,499
CANDIDATE.

19
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:33,101
AND HOW THEY HAVE TREATED

20
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,803
DONALD TRUMP AND I DO

21
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:35,504
BELIEVE THIS IMPACTS WHETHER

22
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:37,839
OR NOT THE MUELLER

23
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:38,774
INVESTIGATION AT ITS

24
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:39,474
FOUNDATION, CONSIDERING IT'S

25
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:42,511
THE SAME PEOPLE INVOLVED NOW

26
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,112
SHOULD ALL GO AWAY AS A

27
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:48,583
RESULT.

28
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,686
I WAS ON YOUR SHOW ABOUT A

29
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:52,254
YEAR AND A HALF WE

30
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:54,689
IDENTIFIED I THINK IT WAS 18

31
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,626
VIOLATION OF THE LAW BY

32
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:02,564
HEATHER PICK ABLE TO PROVE

33
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:03,432
AND IT'S DISGRACEFUL.

34
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:05,567
WE ARE WAY BEYOND HILLARY

35
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:05,901
CLINTON.

36
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:06,802
WE HAVE INVESTIGATION IN THE

37
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:08,170
WORDS OF PRESIDENT DONALD

38
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,037
TRUMP FROM THE VERY

39
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,373
BEGINNING HAS BEEN A FIX, A

40
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,942
FRAME-UP AND A WITCH-HUNT.

41
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:17,079
IT WAS LED BY PETER STRZOK,

42
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,980
WHO IT IS DISGRACEFUL AND

43
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,016
EVEN FOR THE PRESENT

44
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:22,150
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI TO HAVE

45
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,121
HIM THERE TOMORROW WOULD BE

46
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:26,521
DISGRACEFUL.

47
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,956
EVERY FBI AGENT SHOULD

48
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,191
DEMAND THAT THAT MAN BE

49
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,659
FIRED AND TOMORROW MUELLER

50
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,996

TIME TO SAVE HIS DEPARTMENT

56
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,874
SHOULD SUSPEND THAT

57
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:46,308
INVESTIGATION.

58
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:47,776
THROW OUT ALL THE PEOPLE IS

59
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,777
THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

60
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:51,446
THE PHONY TRUMP

61
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,148

00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,454
TRUST IMPLICITLY AND THEY

65
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,555
SHOULD TURN THEIR ATTENTION

66
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:05,494
TO COMEY, STRZOK, PAGE, ALL

67
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:08,096

69
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,899
THAT IS CALLED BRIBERY WHERE

70
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,401

71
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:17,272
THEY TOOK TICKETS THEY PUT

72
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:18,340
GOVERNOR MCDONALD TO JAIL.

73
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,142
THE ANGRY DEMOCRATS WHO WERE

74
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:21,576
WORKING FOR MUELLER.

75
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:22,577
THEY PUT GOVERNOR

76
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,478
MCDAMAGED ON JAIL FOR

77
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:27,115
TAKING A COUPLE LITTLE

78
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,751
TRINKETS, FBI AGENTS SELLING

79
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:33,321

INVESTIGATION.

83
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:42,931
THE GUY AHEAD OF THIS RICCO

84
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,966
CASE IS JIM COMEY HE CREATED

85
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:45,634
THIS ATMOSPHERE IN THE

86
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,468
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

87
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,236
HE WAS THE REASON STRZOK AND

88
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:49,504
PAGE WAS ABLE TO OPERATE.

89
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:50,872
THOSE GUYS ARE TAKING

90
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,607
TICKETS?

91
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,142
FBI AGENTS SHOULD BE

92
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,111
INFURIATED BY THAT I'M

93
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:56,945
INFURIATED BECAUSE I LOVE

94
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,046
THE FBI.

95
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:01,349
THESE PEOPLE DON'T LOVE THE

96
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,152
FBI.

97
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:04,519
I DO.

98
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,220
>> Sean: I WAS JUST GOING TO

99
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,520
SAY.

100
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,555
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE

101
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:08,290
PERSON PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

102
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,291
THIS IS NOT THE RANK AND

103
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:09,591
FILE.

104
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,359
THIS WAS LITERALLY RIPPED

105
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,961
OUT OF THE HANDS OF RANK AND

106
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:13,495
FILE.

107
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:14,229
BROUGHT INTO THE SEVENTH

108
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,930
FLOOR.

109
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,131
THE YOU WERE ECHELON OF THE

110
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:16,398
FBI.

111
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:17,632
I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT

112
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,369
THING HERE IS ESPECIALLY

113
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:22,304
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND

114
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:23,738
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSPECTIVE.

115
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:26,074
IF YOU TREAT ONE CANDIDATE

116
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:29,477
ONE WAY AND YOU LITERALLY

117
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:32,547
HAVE CRIMES AND THE EVIDENCE

118
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,615
IS INCONVO VERT TILLABLE.

119
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:34,883
I NEVER SAW A BETTER CASE

120
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:36,718
FOR OBSTRUCTION THAN HILLARY

121
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,187
DID FOR DELETING EMAILS,

122
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:40,722
ACID WASHING AND BREAKING UP

123
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:41,056
DEVICES.

124
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:41,790
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TREAT

125
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,624
HER THAT WAY.

126
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:45,594
AND YOU LOOK AT THE BULLY

127
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:47,596
TACTICS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

128
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:49,064
TOGETHER BY WEISSMANN AND

129
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,433
BEGINNING STRZOK AND TEAM

130
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,801
MUELLER PUT TOGETHER, HOW

131
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:57,038
COULD ANY AMERICAN AT THIS

132
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:01,576
POINT ENTIRE CONSTITUTIONAL

133
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:01,943
REPUBLIC.

134
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,546
>> I THINK, SEAN, I FEEL

135
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:06,114
THAT THIS WHOLE THING HAS

136
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:07,415
MADE FOOLS OF ALL OF US.

137
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,918
I MEAN, THEY THINK WE ARE

138
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,920
IDIOTS.

139
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,955
WE SUPPLIED 1.4 MILLION

140
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:14,322
DOCUMENTS.

141
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,890
WE SUPPLIED 32 WITNESSES.

142
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,158
NO PRIVILEGE ARGUMENTS.

143
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,293
AND WHO ARE WE SUPPLYING

144
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:18,927
THEM TO?

145
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,394
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY

146
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,164
CONCLUDED TO FRAME DONALD

147
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:24,633
TRUMP AGENTS WHO STARTED A

148
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,002
PHONY RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

149
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:27,435
THIS.

150
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,270
THAT'S WHY THE INVESTIGATION

151
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,305
SHOULD BE SUSPENDED.

152
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,606
AND I AM TALKING FOR MYSELF

153
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:32,941
NOW, NOT THE PRESIDENT.

154
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,843
BUT I BELIEVE HE WOULD AGREE

155
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:36,378
WITH THIS.

156
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:37,178
VERY SERIOUS INVESTIGATION

157
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:41,049
HAS TO BE DONE OF THE FBI

158
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:42,817
AGENTS AT THE VERY TOP BY

159
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,286
FBI AGENTS WHO ARE HONEST.

160
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:47,122
IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE THEM.

161
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:50,091
>> HATRED THEY HAVE FOR

162
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,493
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

163
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:52,994
IT'S ALL THERE IN BLACK AND

164
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:53,295
WHITE.

165
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:54,129
THAT'S POLITICAL.

166
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,397
WHY DID HOROWITZ SAY THERE

167
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:56,631
IS NO EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL

168
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,233
BIAS WHEN IT'S ALL OVER HIS

170
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

171
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,635
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOROWITZ

172
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,103

DIRECTOR CONCLUDED.

174
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,839
I'M BEYOND THAT I THINK ALL

175
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,341
THE ATTENTION NOW SHOULD BE

176
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,476
FOCUSED ON LET'S GET A FAIR

177
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,277

INVESTIGATION FROM THE

182
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,717
BEGINNING.

183
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:16,384
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID

184
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,687
OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO ME.

185
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,288
DID I NOTHING WRONG.

186
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:21,523
HOW COULD THIS BE?

187
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,358
NOW WE KNOW HOW IT IS.

188
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:24,926
BECAUSE, THESE PEOPLE FIXED

189
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:27,195

00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:36,871
SPEND THE ONE OF THE

197
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,673
PRESIDENT AND ALL THE PEOPLE

198
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:39,808
TORTURED BY IT, THEN I DON'T

199
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:40,942
THINK WE HAVE JUSTICE

200
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,345
ANYMORE IN THIS COUNTRY.

201
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,079
>> Shepard: LAST POINT.

202
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,880
ROD ROSENSTEIN, WE NOW KNOW

203
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,917
IN MEETINGS, HAS THREATENED

204
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,452
TO SUBPOENA EMAILS,

205
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:52,954
INTIMIDATE, HARASSING

206
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:54,022
CONGRESSMAN AND THEIR STAFFS

207
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,924
WHO HAVE BEEN TASKED

208
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:56,558
CONSTITUTIONALLY WITH THE

209
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:58,126
DUTY OF OVERSIGHT.

210
00:05:58,126 --> 00:06:01,096
YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE THREATS

211
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:02,597
HE IS THE GUY THAT SIGNED

212
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:03,998
THE LAST FISA WARRANT

213
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,567
KNOWING THAT THE BULK OF

214
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,435
INFORMATION PHONY CLINTON

215
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,503
PAID FOR DOSSIER AND HE IS

216
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,205
THE GUY WHO RECOMMENDED

217
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:10,638
FIRING COMEY.

218
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,073
IS HE CONFLICTED.

219
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:12,741
INTIMIDATING AND THREATENING

220
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,109
TO USE THE POWER OF THE

221
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:14,809
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AGAINST

222
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,044
CONGRESSMAN AND THEIR

223
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,011
STAFFS, WHAT DO YOU CALL

224
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:17,312
THAT?

225
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,613
TO ME IT SOUNDS LIKE

226
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,614
OBSTRUCTION.

227
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:20,382
>> YEAH.

228
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:22,584
IT'S A LOT CLEARER

229
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:23,284
OBSTRUCTION THAN FIRING

230
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:24,919
COMEY ON HIS RECOMMENDATION,

231
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,721
WHICH IS NOT OBSTRUCTION.

232
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,590
IT'S WITHIN THE PRESIDENT'S

233
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,190
ARTICLE 2 POWERS.

234
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,594
SO I BELIEVE THAT ROD

235
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:33,695
ROSENSTEIN AND JEFF SESSIONS

236
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,196
HAVE A CHANCE TO REDEEM

237
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:35,597
THEMSELVES.

238
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:36,531
THAT CHANCE COMES ABOUT

239
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:36,898
TOMORROW.

240
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,167
IT DOESN'T GO BEYOND

241
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:39,534
TOMORROW.

242
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,069
TOMORROW MUELLER SHOULD BE

243
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,137
SUSPENDED AND HONEST PEOPLE

244
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,506
SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN,

245
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,206
IMPARTIAL PEOPLE TO

246
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,274
INVESTIGATE THESE PEOPLE

247
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:46,975
LIKE STRZOK.

248
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:48,042
STRZOK SHOULD BE IN JAIL BY

249
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,912
THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

250
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:51,679
