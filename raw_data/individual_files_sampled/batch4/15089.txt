no he was not mentally ill at all that's just an excuse so I don't think people seem to realize that his family didn't write that statement it was in the New York Times and they were able to get some stuff out also I got something to say something I really want to say Tori's listening to this on the statement I completely agree with you sir it was incredibly polished it doesn't look like the statement from an elderly couple who's second language is English what do you make of that who do you think wrote that was a third party agency who they hired and I have something I want to say I want to say for a long time if Tory's listening to this I just want to say stop it with the BS of the city safe this proves it's not safe every time he says it's safe something worse happens someone got stabbed on that square said it was safe this happens so stop saying it's safe and actually do something about it what would you like the authorities to do sir start carding again start carding I mean you got nothing to hide you got nothing to fear I think I was carted way back and I'm like here you want to see it take it I got nothing hide you know you raise a very good point again I mean the police complain that the tools of law enforcement are being taken out of their hands the carding they took the police in Schools program that was cancelled on the behest of black lives matter Toronto would you like to see the return of these programs and for the elected officials to stand up to the usual suspects at protesters yeah cuz honestly before all that was removed there was like yeah we still had some stuff going on but like it wasn't as bad as it is now I mean like people nowadays are shooting people up like there was this guy if you look at the video he didn't hesitate he knew exactly what he was doing and he killed like a ten-year-old girl who like you know I mean how much how long until like somebody to do something also I'm sick and tired of like this political correctness stuff like um I have friends who are from different you know races and all that cultures like we all you know what I'm saying is just look at the bigger picture stop comparing it to all these other places and just look at the bigger picture like go back to carding think I nothing to hide they got nothing to fear and so you raise another good point I mean the way the narrative has been drafted is that this individual was motivated solely by mental illness no he was not mentally ill at all that's just an excuse I mean if I could just rewind to like the van attack that happened about what in April they said the guy had Asperger's or whatever I have Asperger's syndrome I've had since I was six years old no matter how angry I've gone I've never wanted to like take a van and run people over and this dude he was not mentally ill he knew exactly what he was doing certainly the news of the day is that Isis is take claiming responsibility for this it has been reported that he visited Isis website said he simple pledged support to Isis do you think that this was perhaps an act of terrorism oh yeah I think terrorism is happening is happening here and people don't seem to understand they want to sweep it under the rug my mother's from New York City and in the States like yes like terrorists terrorism happens there but at least they get the info and they release to the public cuz we the public have a right to know I'm tired of this like hiding behind stuff we have a right to know who these people are why they're here you know and I mean I'm not trying to get political here if I may say but again do not label me racist but they're just letting people in here people who have we don't know who they are they have they could have ties for all we know meanwhile you get people who actually been working hard to get here their entire lives I have a friend who just immigrated here with her family and they worked for years to get here they're hardworking people they were given the most hurdles people come here and clean refugee sites they just let them in look what is that hey folks the Breville has a brand new app please download the rebel app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
