these kites handmade with flaming rags have become a tool for Palestinian protesters rallying along Gaza Spence they've not caused a single death but they have burned more than 7,000 acres of land on the Israeli side the Israeli prime minister issued a warning about the kites at Sunday's cabinet meeting hours after his military targeted Hamas in Gaza I heard it being said that Israel has agreed to a ceasefire that would allow the continuation of terrorism by incendiary kites and balloons this is incorrect we are not prepared to accept any attacks against us and we will respond appropriately for now the Egyptian brokered ceasefire between Hamas and Israel appears to be largely holding but it is fragile will not tolerate the scenario by which its citizens will be constantly held hostages by the Hamas so hopefully there will be a hood but the problem is that sometimes a an incident by which a kindergarten is is a heat of something can spark a huge explosion on the streets of occupied East Jerusalem we ask Palestinians how they feel about the kites and Israel's attacks they don't have any other tools it's true that these kites can be harmful it's our land that they're burning but the land is occupied and they don't have any other way to resist dozens are real men but we here are very weak if we had the right mindset we would all close our shops in solidarity with Gaza the march of return rallies are now into their fourth month with protesters demanding the right for Palestinian refugees to return to their homes they were evicted from in 1948 scores have been killed by Israeli snipers it's a political problem for Israel that refuses to go away we're told Israel doesn't want an escalation its army is already busy on its northern border in the occupied Golan Heights but Israel has made it clear that if the flaming kites continue it is ready to increase its military action the army and the intelligence services have been warning the political leadership that the current blockade on Gaza is not sustainable and if it continues it could lead to an all-out conflict the flaming kites have already led to the biggest escalation since the 2014 war the question now is will they stop and will the Palestinians of Gaza be getting anything in return Stephanie Decker al-jazeera Jerusalem
