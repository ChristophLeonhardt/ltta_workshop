>> HE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE, VERY
SLOPPY.
MEAN DRUNK.
HE WOULD PUSH HIS BODY AGAINST
THEIRS, GROPE THEM.
>> THERE'S THINGS SHE TOLD US ON
CAMERA THAT DIFFER FROM HER
WRITTEN STATEMENT.
ALL AFTERNOON, THE LITTLE LIES,
LYING OVER AND OVER AGAINST HIS
YEAR BOOK PAGE.
>> I KNOW THAT IF HE GETS TO THE
SUPREME COURT, A GOOD CHUNK OF
THIS COUNTRY WILL THINK THAT
SOMEBODY THAT GOT AWAY WITH
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS SITTING ON THE
SUPREME COURT.
>> Ed: NEW CALLS FROM LEGAL
EXPERTS URGING JUDGE KAVANAUGH
TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST SOME OF
THOSE UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS
PUSHED IN THE MEDIA NIGHT AFTER
NIGHT.
ALLEGATIONS THAT KAVANAUGH SAYS
HAVE RUINED HIS GOOD NAME.
>> THIS HAS DESTROYED MY FAMILY
AND MY GOOD NAME.
A GOOD NAME BUILT UP THROUGH
DECADES OF VERY HARD WORK AND
PUBLIC SERVICE AT THE HIGHEST
LEVELS OF THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT.
>> Ed: MY NEXT GUEST WRITING,
UNSOLICITED ADVICE TO JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, SUE THEM ALL.
ATTORNEY ELLEN WOOD IS A
REPUTATION PROTECTION EXPERT.
GOOD EVENING.
>> GOOD EVENING.
>> Ed: YOU'VE HEARD THE
ALLEGATIONS.
YOU HEARD THEM ALL.
WHAT IS MOST ACTIONABLE?
CALLING SOMEONE A LIAR IS PAR
FOR THE COURSE IN WASHINGTON.
SLOP MY MEAN DRUNK, SOMEONE
GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WITHOUT
EVIDENCE.
WHAT DO YOU SEE IS ACTIONABLE?
>> WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU AN
EXAMPLE.
WHEN NBC MADE THE DECISION TO
PUT MRS. SWETNICK ON THEIR AIR,
THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY COULD
NOT CORROBORATE HER STORY.
THAT'S RECKLESSNESS.
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, WHEN YOU
PUT SOMEONE ON THE AIR TO MAKE
ACCUSATIONS OF A HEINOUS CRIME,
YOU OUGHT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR IT.
>> Ed: YOU AND I BOTH KNOW "THE
NEW YORK TIMES" VERSUS SULLIVAN,
NBC WILL SAY WE WERE
TRANSPARENT, WE COULDN'T CONFIRM
IT BUT WE WERE AIRING IT AND
TRYING TO GIVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH
HIS SIDE.
WHAT SAY YOU?
>> I SAY THE SHOUT OF GUILTY IS
NEVER OVERCOME BY THE GUILTY OF
INNOCENCE.
NBC CAN DISCLAIM THEIR ACTIONS
OR EXPLAIN THEM AWAY BUT IT'S
IRRESPONSIBLE.
"NEW YORK TIMES" VERSUS
SULLIVAN.
I'M AWARE OF THAT DECISION.
IT'S NOT EASY TO SUE IF YOU'RE A
PUBLIC FIGURE TO PROVE ACTUAL
MALICE.
ACTUAL MALICE CAN GO WITH A
RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR TRUTHITY.
NBC ACTED RECKLESSLY AND DIDN'T
HAVE ANY REGARD FOR TRUTH OR
FALSITY.
>> Ed: AND SHE ALLEGED AMONG
OTHER THINGS, GANG RAPE.
SHE COULDN'T PLACE JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AS SOMEONE THERE.
BUT HE MAY HAVE SPIKED THE
PUNCH.
HE VEHEMENTLY DENIES IT AND
MICHAEL AVENATTI SAYS THAT IF
THEY'RE ALL CONVINCED THAT MY
CLIENT IS LYING, HE'S INNOCENT,
HIS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED FOR NO
REASON, HE SHOULD SUE US TODAY.
I HOPE HE DOES SO SO WE CAN
PROVE THE TRUTH.
HE THINKS IF YOU OPEN THIS UP TO
DISCOVERY, A JUSTICE ON THE
SUPREME COURT DOESN'T WANT TO GO
THROUGH DISCOVERY AND THAT
PAINFUL PROCESS.
>> MICHAEL AVENATTI WANTS TO BE
SUED BECAUSE HE WANTS AN EXCUSE
TO REMAIN RELEVANT IN THE PUBLIC
EYE AS HE APPARENTLY CAMPAIGNS
TO THE UNITED STATES.
LOOK, THE BURDEN OF PROOF IT
DOES FLIP THE SYSTEM ON ITS
HEAD.
NOT UNLIKE WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND THE
HEARING.
WHEN YOU FILE A LIBEL LAWSUIT,
YOU HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROOF.
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ACCUSATION SO
HEINOUS TO ACCUSE THIS MAN,
BEING INVOLVED IN GANG RAPE,
SEXUAL ASSAULT, SOMETIMES THE
DECISION HAS TO BE THAT DOING
NOTHING IS UNACCEPTABLE.
I DON'T EXPECT JUDGE KAVANAUGH
WILL FILE A LAWSUIT.
HE WILL SPEND THE NEXT FEW YEARS
HOPEFULLY WRITING SOME
INCREDIBLE DECISIONS ON THE
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AS
OPPOSED TO BEING A LITIGANT IN A
CIVIL LAWSUIT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE MY
ADVICE.
THE MESSAGE SHOULD BE SENT.
PEOPLE NEEDS TO KNOW THERE NEEDS
TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.
>> Ed: HOW DO YOU WEIGH THAT?
THERE'S A COST BENEFIT.
I HEAR YOU AND I SAY THIS MAN
SAYS HIS REPUTATION WAS UNFAIRLY
DESTROYED.
HE SHOULD STAND UP.
ON THE OTHER HAND AS YOU SAID,
IF HE IS IN FACT CONFIRMED
TOMORROW AS WE EXPECT AND WE'LL
SEE IF THERE'S A SNAG, HE'S GOT
MORE IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO DO.
SHOULD HE BE WASTING TIME
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE A WASTE
BUT YOU AND OTHERS BUT SHOULD HE
SPEND TIME ON THE HIGH COURT
DEALING WITH MICHAEL AVENATTI
AND THE REST OR SHOULD HE JUST
MOVE ON?
>> I THINK HE HAS ACTIONABLE
CASES.
I WOULD RECOMMEND TO HIM THAT
THEY HAVE MERIT.
THE CLIENT HAS TO DECIDE THAT
COST BENEFIT PRO AND CON
ANALYSIS.
IT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR
HIM TO PUT ASIDE HIS RIGHT TO
CLEAR HIS NAME IN A COURT OF LAW
SO THAT HE CAN WORK FOR THE NEXT
SEVERAL YEARS ON MAKING SURE
THAT THE RIGHTS OF THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC ARE ENFORCED UNDER THE
CONSTITUTION.
I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CHOICE.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT
THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW THAT
EVEN WITH THE SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE WE CANNOT TOLERATE THIS
IDEA OF ACCUSATIONS THAT ARE
UNSUPPORTED BEING TURNED INTO
FINDINGS OF GUILT.
UNSUPPORTED ACCUSATIONS CANNOT
BE THE BASIS FOR SAYING THAT
SOMEONE IS GUILTY OF A CRIME.
THERE'S GOT TO BE DUE PROCESS IN
THIS COUNTRY, AND PEOPLE DON'T
SEEM TO GIVE A LOT OF CREDENCE
TO DUE PROCESS.
I BELIEVE PEOPLE WOULD IF THE
TIME COMES WHERE THEY WANT TO
RELY ON IT TO PROTECT THEIR
REPUTATIONS AND THE REPUTATIONS
OF THEIR FAMILY.
>> Ed: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN WHAT
MANY HAVE BELIEVED TO BE A
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION LIKE
THIS?
LIKE I SAID ON SOCIAL MEDIA,
PEOPLE ARE ATTACKING EACH OTHER
ALL THE TIME.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS?
>> IT'S GOTTEN A LOT WORSE, ED,
BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEY DID TO
RICHARD JEWEL, GARY CONDITT.
I'VE HAD A LOT OF CLIENTS WHERE
THE ACCUSATIONS HAVE BEEN
EGREGIOUS AND HEINOUS.
THIS PROBABLY TAKES THE CAKE.
THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST CASE
OF SUSTAINED ACCUSATIONS AGAINST
A MAN WITH AN IMPECCABLE LIFE
HISTORY AS AN ADULT.
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE MEDIA STOOP
TO THIS LEVEL OF RECKLESSNESS.
THEY NEED TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.
IF NOT IN THIS CASE, IN ANOTHER
CASE IF THEY DO IT AGAIN.
