it seems fitting that on the 4th of July the Statue of Liberty might get a bit more attention than usual after all there's really no more enduring an instantly recognizable symbol of America this 4th of July was a bit different this fourth of July Lady Liberty garnered attention for what a single gutsy protestor did scaling the Statue live on TV that is Patricia o Kumu personal trainer Staten Island resident and apparently not very afraid of heights MS o Kumu told police that she was protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant kids from their parents a policy that has left nearly 3,000 children scared and alone in detention centers across the u.s. Mizzou Kumu is herself an immigrant she moved to the u.s. from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1994 and is now a naturalized American citizen though this is trump administration policy she's protesting MS Okuma says that it was another former White House occupant who actually inspired her to take action Michelle Obama our beloved first lady that I care so much about say when they go low we go high and I went as high as I could after more than three hours standoff with police missile kuhmo finally came down she's since been charged with three misdemeanors including trespassing and she has pleaded not guilty and joining us now is Patricia o Kumu in her first TV interview since her big climb and JW Walker an organizer with the activist group rise and resist thank you both for being here I'm gonna start with you you were at the Statue I assented lead to protest the administration policy but what made you scale the statue well wise and resist had be planning this action as far as displaying a banner the way we did some people were wearing t-shirt that says abolished eyes and I figured okay I've never been to the Statue of Liberty I don't know I would love to climb up there with the sign the banner but it wasn't something I was willing to discuss with the group because I didn't want to be discouraged to stop you yes and what did you think JW when Patricia started heading up the statue well the truth is that no one in the group realized that it was Patricia when people first noticed that there was a person up there and originally since it wasn't a part of our plan to action we were like oh that's somebody else that's some daredevil we had no idea and it wasn't until some of the photographers that were with us used their telephoto zoom lenses and really got a good look at the person that we're like oh my gosh that's Patricia so we'd already even issued a statement saying oh that has nothing to do with us that's oh that's just some some other person and then once we realized it was Patricia well obviously the first thing was a concerned about her safety and concern that knowing that she was going to be engaging with law enforcement she's a woman of color good that was going to be engaging law enforcement so we were concerned about about the you know the possibility that she might be injured when she was brought down yeah and so we just immediately started trying to find legal assistance for her yeah well on that point and of course you know as a woman of color engaging with long force I think I'm glad you made that point because some of the criticisms obviously of you is that you endangered yourself you know that it's put police in danger but also as a woman of color you then creating an engagement with law enforcement that could have compounded a tragedy upon tragedy well how do you respond to those criticisms Ms Reid I manifest I should call you Joe yes of course I do yeah I wasn't worried about that that's wasn't the first thing in my mind my concern was for the kids being a kid it was this is just cruel and inhumane I couldn't live with that I had to do something and what was the message that you wanted people to take away from what you were doing that children don't belong in cages and they needed to be immediately reunited with their families then mom and dad and JW you know as far as the group is concerned does this fit with sort of the overall rise and resists message is this what you want direct action oh well that's what we are we're a direct actually group that's that's how we were formed that's what we do you know obviously we were planning a very specific action with the banner drop and with the folks with the t-shirts we generally don't plan things where people are going to be in a sort of peril or danger but we absolutely support Patricia and what she did the fact is that we were there to call attention to ice to call attention to how much ice is subverting and perverting all the ideals that America holds holds dear and and Patricia just took it to the next level once we realized that she was safe when she was down and she was safe and there was there was there was nothing you know endangering her all we could do was celebrate celebrate the success in the attention to to ice and to these issues that she brought well let's talk a little bit about you know how the Trump administration's policies have hit you as an immigrant and we share something in common I have Congolese roots you are from the Republic of Congo when you first started hearing the way that Donald Trump talks about immigrants as whole countries in fact referring to some African countries the changes in in migration policy and now the detention of children just tell me how that hit you as an immigrant well first of all Donald J Trump is a distracter in chief and no way I'm going to focus my attention talking about his insult to immigrant I think he's a dog Whistler he's trying to divide the country we are a democracy we stand for peace and the Constitution protect everybody including including immigrants there is a process it's got something called a due process and he's ignorant unfortunately so I would not normalize his behavior it's unprecedented and what is rise and resist sort of plan I mean there has been a fair amount of people feeling disconcerted not sure what to do there are people who feel angry frustrated scared you know what is the plan that rises and resists hats the plan is just to constantly call attention to the just to the sort of crimes against our very nature as Americans that Donald Trump and his administration are committing regularly on a daily basis you know our it's not just it's obviously not just ice it's the Customs and Border Patrol but ice is taking people who have been living and working and paying taxes and raising their families here for decades and storming into their homes and removing them over over poorly filled out paperwork there early immigration process it's disgusting and and just briefly before we go what you're the leak the status of your legal case now when you're expected to be in court August dirt August 3rd all right well hopefully you'll update us on what's happening with your legal situation glad that you've made it safely to the ground thank you thank you very much Patricia okuma and J Walker JW Walker
