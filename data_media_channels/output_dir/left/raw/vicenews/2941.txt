checks then the story that some of these

science fiction

82
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,380
we honed in on one man he was a young

ethnic Albanian<font color="#E5E5E5"> who had joined the</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another in Albania they somehow had</font>

gotten wind of what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of people being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> killed for their</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">shoot them so they wouldn't be cut up</font>

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">for body parts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he was disgusted by that</font>

94
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,150
and this man never asked anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

95
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,630
us no<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> women but still even if</font>

96
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,750
we believed in him you need details<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

97
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,670
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to isolate one location this</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a house in central Albania</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font>

believed<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these captives were</font>

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">House we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the location</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and one day I</font>

102
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,660
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trip there I went with an</font>

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">Albanian driver and a translator</font>

104
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,420
and luck would have it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our car</font>

105
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">broke down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a mile from the village</font>

106
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk into the village</font>

107
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">and keeping in mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a place</font>

108
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,230
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposedly some really really bad</font>

109
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">things went down very remote they don't</font>

110
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,810
see foreigners very often so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> walked</font>

111
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,880
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a muddy road through these homes</font>

112
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty poor area and we saw the house</font>

113
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,280
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sitting on its own across this</font>

114
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,030
field<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there was a tiny little shop</font>

115
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">nearby that sold soft drinks and so we</font>

116
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,170
stopped<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

117
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">surrounded by villagers and people were</font>

118
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking questions and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,490
didn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable telling these</font>

120
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a journalist of what I</font>

121
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,140
was there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I didn't feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safe</font>

122
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,330
the road ends at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> house and it</font>

123
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't go further into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mountains</font>

124
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I concocted a ridiculous story</font>

125
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I was a highway engineer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

126
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,870
the possibility of whether the road that

127
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,550
ended there could be continued through a

128
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,410
narrow mountain<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass to connect with</font>

129
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">another town that was my cover story and</font>

130
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it must have seemed absurd to the</font>

131
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,910
villagers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

132
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,500
them that I was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for an</font>

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,720
organ harvesting operation and asking

134

them were there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Serb civilians</font>

135
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,460
buried nearby<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the villagers</font>

136
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,620
believed I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was enough</font>

137
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,640

very strange scene the team looked right

to work and within a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some IV drip bags that had been out in</font>

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> determined that some of those drugs</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">could be used as muscle relaxants during</font>

174
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,290
surgical<font color="#E5E5E5"> operations and then perhaps the</font>

175
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,419
strangest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing was at night we went</font>

176
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the house and the team decided</font>

177
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the surfaces</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the floors</font>

178
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,440
in the house and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a substance</font>

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">called luminol which illuminates areas</font>

180
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,590
where there may have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> blood so this</font>

181
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,780
team started<font color="#CCCCCC"> spraying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in what was the</font>

182
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">living room and to our amazement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,880
of the floor lit up there were

184
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,380
indications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there had been</font>

185
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,410
considerable blood<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that floor but</font>

186
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,270
there was one place and it was the

187
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,250
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the floor and there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

188
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,100
of a rectangular<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot where there</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't any indications of blood was it</font>

190
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,110
an operating table<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't know</font>

191
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,810
just as strange when the team leader

192
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">started asking the family members why</font>

193
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,740
there may have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> blood on this floor</font>

194

<font color="#CCCCCC">they came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with different answers at</font>

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,670
one point one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the men lived at the</font>

196

house<font color="#CCCCCC"> that his wife had given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> birth in</font>

197
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,110
the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that I guess in his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

198
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,170
explained why there would be evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

199
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,410
huge amounts of blood on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> floor</font>

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately his wife contradicted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

201
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,550
the next day and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the man said well</font>

202
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,919
we slaughter animals<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that room as</font>

203
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,500
part of a Muslim holiday which seemed

204
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weird that you would slaughter</font>

animals<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your living room</font>

206
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,370
there was no conclusive proof of

anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was enticing evidence but</font>

208
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,090
