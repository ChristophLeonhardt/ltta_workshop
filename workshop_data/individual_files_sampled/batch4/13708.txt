so here we are with Charlie Kirk in Canada so ins Charlie of course the head of turning-point USA and Candice is the communications director as your official title over a turning-point USA and it's really exciting to have you here glad you could squeeze in the time because you guys have been busy setting the world on fire I mean you're in the headlines and you're all over Twitter obviously and on social media why don't you give me sort of the status update Charlie and then I want to ask Anne to some questions about sort of what's going on in in her great crusade to break up yeah the group identities have been going great and we've had a unbelievable semester we spoke I think over 38 times since January first and laughs is's and you know that takes a grind because you do a lot of speaking - we did UCLA Stanford and UC Berkeley in the last six weeks been amazing we have our Young Women's Leadership Summit coming up next week and your speak in there and yeah we just been you know kicking butt taking names we're expanding to more and more campuses but we see a not so silent majority growing on college campuses and the revolution is brewing how are you handling the additional sort of media attention because I saw there's big New York Times piece on you and yeah they're not in love with laughs they're addictive and but look that's how you know you're making a difference right no one hunts small deer is I always like to say and having Candace as a added component of what we're doing if not the leading the charge has just been awesome it's just been amazing to have her voice be able to message out to this generation and to our members and our students on campus it's been really powerful well speaking on fire obviously Candace you've just exploded onto the scene I think probably a year and a half ago nobody knew who you were and now everybody knows who you are so how's that has that been that sort of precipitous rise it's it's been challenging in some in some ways I guess because you have to understand that every time that you gain I guess you could say 200,000 followers you have to sort of change your approach because people start looking at you from different angles and you have to become more of an example for many people and it's an interesting place to be and when you can tweet something and it becomes national news it's it's bizarre and people don't understand that they don't understand and it's not only national news it's how they interpret it could not be what you intended but that becomes national news their own interpretation of it so it's been challenging but it's also been tremendously exciting because we're seeing the difference in the comments we're seeing that black people are starting to debate one another and they weren't doing they weren't they all had decided that they were Democrats and that was it they had to accept that because Republicans were racist because you're a racist because charlie is a racist Raymond but that's it yes so it's interesting to see them start to have a different discussion and to start to view me as someone who's a lot more thoughtful than they initially thought they thought it was all for a paycheck right and the tides are turning so how did you get here ideologically because that that's how do you get from point A to point B because again it's not like you know I came up in the conservative movement Charlie came up in the conservative movement but you're relatively new to the conservative it's what sort of your conversion story what was the moment on the road to Damascus you know it was a lot I always say this I was never a liberal in terms of politics I just assumed I was a liberal I didn't care about politics at all and that's really the truth about the majority of the black community we're not paying attention to politics our communities have been so burdened by issues by finances by the fact that the fathers removed from the home one of my favorite videos by the way is of you when you shut down black lives matter if I start asking some really good questions one of the first videos that Charlie sent me when I started sort of having this Awakening and wanting to get involved and I looked to people like you to sort of say wait a second something's not adding up so I would say in I guess July of last year I was working in finance had was not paying attention to politics at all obviously I think with the rise of Donald Trump everyone started paying attention to politics everyone had to develop an opinion and when it came down to was that my beliefs and everything that I had fought for in my life aligned with conservatism I've always had to work hard I was never given any handouts I had a hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt my grandfather was extremely pious I was raised with prayers around the dinner table the Bible stories in the morning and today that's a conservative position so when I started paying attention I realized that I was a conservative well what's what's really interesting is all these new conversations that are happening I mean obviously the most prominent that both of you have been involved in are these conversations with Kanye West which I can say completely came out of left field for most people myself included so how much do you think that those conversations are actually shifting across the country for young people and then also how much do you think that the celebrity conversations shift conversations more broadly and I will say this it came out of left field for me and for you but not for her when I first so I hired Candace Owens four and a half minutes after I met her I saw passion and vision unlike anything that I've encountered and from the first couple minutes afterward she's like Charlie don't understand Kanye West isn't it come out as a conservative Trump supporter I was like I was like I was like come on and and I kind of I was not very pop culture illiterate she's moving better they're not now you'd be surprised I said I was like wait to see the one married to Beyonce and she's like I did I just agree to work for this guy it was so bad we're doing a lot better now um but you know she she started to get me listening to his music I saw her stuff it's like just pounding me and she's like this is gonna happen and so that's the first thing but and I'm when this happened and he said I love the way Candace Owens thinks that was one of his first public statements right long time and you know she sense kind of has forward friendship and relationship there but I think he saw a chance the rapper come out and he had been and denounced what he said you know black people out to be Democrats but I love this in Candace pointed out so accurately on Twitter Connie didn't apologize for his vocalization of support and now his music is doing better than ever who better than Eminem who and have Firma tried to make all career out of it so I understood obviously coming from within a black hole which you can understand the stats and it's important that you do I think what you do is so important when you hit the stage you ask these questions when you talk about the single motherhood rate but in order to understand how we got brainwashed how did I I'm always been a very smart girl I've always placed well in school and on tests how did I start to believe that all Republicans were racist so I had to sort of say when did this seep into my mind and the truth is that it's it's systemic there are three verticals that they're able to attack if you if you say it's attack I think it's an attack the way that black people think the first is family it's the breakdown of the family which you've spoken about right the single motherhood rate and when you remove the father from the home the black youth then begins to idolize culture this vertical is so important when you understand that instead of listening to mom and dad because dad's not in the home they're listening to jay-z and Kanye West and Beyonce to tell them what's right and what's wrong this is why Hillary Clinton throws a jay-z and Beyonce concert and doesn't actually go into the black communities and speaks in about their issues because she knows now if she can get Beyonce to wear an iron with her shirt then the black community will support it do I agree with that no but that's what's happening so that vertical has to be attacked the third of course is education we learn our history wrong we actually are learning in school that there public Democratic Party switched the Southern Strategy is taught in school I didn't really know how to attack that vertical but Charlie was already doing it so I understood the first two and Charlie understood the third and it was sort of like a perfect partnership and and that was what we really wanted to go after what you guys are obviously are doing is is making a big difference I mean we see all the videos online of you talking to people who never would have considered conservatism before and suddenly they're looking at it for a second time and certain all these conversations and really good luck to have with you I mean I know that you guys are running from place to place you have an incredibly busy schedule over the next few weeks particularly and I hope that you can continue to do so much of the good work that you've been doing obviously been a big advocate for turning point for a long time and and you guys are doing great work out there so really good so thanks for stopping by I really appreciate this is awesome
