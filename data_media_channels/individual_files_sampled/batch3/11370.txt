our dynamic and friendly bilateral relations including the political cooperation trade and commercial links and humanitarian ties in the context of reaching the agreements between the presidents of Russia and Iran and of course they will exchange opinions on the current international regional topics including the situation around the comprehensive action plan on the Iran nuclear program I will get back to this topic later today on the third of May the foreign minister of Jordan will visit Russia during the talks which will take place in Sochi the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia and foreign minister of Jordan will exchange their views on a large number of matters of international and regional agenda I will discuss the prospects of creating new bilateral ways of cooperation they will discuss the situation in Syria with an emphasis on the events in the south of the country in particular the de-escalation zones and special attention will be paid to the prospects of promoting me of promoting Middle East settlement keeping in mind a dangerous escalation of the Palestinian territory situation first of all in the Gaza sector the dialogue between the has the Foreign Ministries of Russia in Jordan is rather rich it's characterized by a high degree of trust since our position on many regional and international problems are the same and in case there are any changes we will inform you additionally just like it happened today Sergey Lavrov had a brief meeting with his Armenian counterpart the head of the Armenian foreign ministry you're still no Bachan they discussed the situation on the contact line between nagorno-karabakh and Azerbaijan now we move on to the main part the International Relations and foreign policy of Russia and I will start with Syria in the last week the situation in Syria was still affected by the negative consequences of the strikes carried out on the 14th of April by US Britain and France unfortunately a radical extremists have intensified their activities following the actions of the Western trio they managed to restore their ranks now they have direct moral support Fatah Nostra continue shelling towns in Homs province there are more clashes in the Deir Ezzor province around al mayadeen and abu kamal towns and since some of the people of Isis refused to cooperate and the surrender especially in the Yarmouk Palestinian camp on the 19th of April the armed forces of Syria began a massive anti-terrorist operation but positive trends still remain the fighters are being evacuated from East kalamoon and around 10,000 fighters have fled to the north of Syria with their families and after that five or six thousand more of the unappeased fighters will leave the territory and it will become absolutely clear of illegal armed groups they have handed over heavy armaments including tanks and artillery systems more than 60,000 rifles and a large number of ammo the Syrian authorities continue being active in helping the population of the liberated territories and restoring the infrastructure according to the department of healthcare of damascus region since the beginning of march more than 86,000 refugees from east gouta have received medical aid within the nationwide campaign - of vaccination the syrian health ministry will help almost three million syrian children and according to the energy ministry by the mid of May the Deir Rizal province will have energy supply the expert group of the old CCW has restored work they arrived in Dhoom on the 21st of April Russia is providing support to this group first of all in providing its safety and security Russia expects that the experts will carried out an impartial investigation and will provide a report as soon as possible I would also like to say that we have taken note the statement by the French Foreign Minister mr. Yun he said that Russia constantly undertakes manipulation due to the supposed chemical incident in the Syrian town of Duma according to France Russia supposedly spreads video recordings with children while 45 people lost their lives what mr. Lord Ram the situation is different the materials presented by Russia unlike those that you used in Paris when taking the decision to join the American attack the Russian materials show real eye witnesses those who saw the events in Duma as you know as we all know the OPCW already contacted the eyewitnesses they have arrived in The Hague and now they will personally talk with the Member States give them the first-hand information the video recordings and the social media materials and internet log Publishing's who do not even have an author those that you spread mr. lorry on as proof of the necessity of striking against the capital of a sovereign state they have arrived they will talk in hey they hate life they will say what's being done and how these fake videos are made how they have signed and appoint the rolls they will talk about it today the victims mentioned by mr. Adrian oh those who are injured or even traces of chemical weapons none of it was found should agree that the proof base is different perhaps the reason for such an emotional reaction such an emotional interview of the French Foreign Minister was the weaker position of those who supported the illegal aggression against Syria the credibility of the photos and videos which were used to make accusations against Syria is questioned by the representatives of the French political parties themselves during the debate in the parliament on the 16th of April they said was no serious proof that the asset regime actually used chemical weapons in Duma and some of the French political forces the parties and the movements directly say that these videos were fake what can I also tell my French colleagues 15 years ago France managed not to be trapped not to get into the trap made by Washington saying that Iraq had chemical weapons what happened with France in the last 15 years I would like you to take note of the report of the scientific service of the Bundestag published on the 14th of April this is a research facility of the German parliament and this report shows the international legal evaluation of the actions of the US France and Britain the attack as a response to the supposed chemical attack in Duma they made an evaluation using the basis of international law the retaliation strikes against any state are unacceptable they go against the principles of non use of force and the threat of use of force in the spirit of the article 4 of the charter of the UN according to the experts moreover so they say that the Chemical Weapons Convention already mentions the legal mechanisms of putting their responsibility and acting outside of the document looks doubtful from the point of view of international law they also analyze the doctrinal of the operation by its authors for instance London openly explained joining the operation by the doctrine of so-called humanitarian intervention the question is why was the most massive chemical attack in Douma acting as a trigger for such an operation while nothing was done in the previous seven years and let me remind you that the war in Syria has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives of civilians with the absolute stoic condole with the accusing and justifying the actions of those who fought against the Syrian regime over the humanitarian intervention implies protecting the population not punishing the states for violating international law the experts of the Bundestag qualified the attack of the US and its allies as an unhidden return to the military countermeasures disguised as humanitarian actions and the reaction from Berlin shows this during the press conference of the on the 23rd of April of the vice prime minister of the Vice Chancellor they said that they took this report into consideration but the official position remains the same the reaction to the chemical attack was necessary as they said this is a paradox we should not call this analysis a document but still this is a material made by the analysts by the experts of the government and the Parliament the government has no arguments against it they simply confirmed their solidarity with the United States had carried out a strike along with Britain and France and before the recent press conference the German state channel CDF said that the chemical attack in Duma was simply a fake at least this was said life by early guard the reporter who made his own journalists investigation she went to the suppose it attack site he talked with the locals and the people there are sure that the whole story was a staged and there were several provocative actions like that during the so-called exercise people were affected by a chlorine this all was recorded and then these materials were published as proof I'm just quoting the German TV channel previously we asked ourselves who will be responsible by for thee all these provocations where the use by the humanitarian organisations and the civil society or the civilians now the question is different when will they take the responsibility as for the authorship of these actions there's no question here we've all seen how all these fakes were made how they were momentarily caught on by the Western establishment and what actions were taken right after these videos were published and what they resulted in they resulted in one thing the increased activity of illegal armed groups this is the whole process of fake production I also wanted to remind you including mr. Adrienne but I mostly address our American colleagues let me remind you that yesterday our defense ministry held a briefing and I think many of you were there yesterday it was held for Russian and foreign media it concerned the analysis of the results of the illegal u.s. attacks of the sovereign state of Syria they had slides and presentations showing the geographical distribution of the strikes moreover let me remind you all the remains and parts of the ammunition provided all have their serial numbers intact what could be easier these are not just scraps of metal these warheads have their serial numbers so even the journalists could send requests possibly to the Pentagon or to the White House since the president of the US said that he called someone and got confirmation that all the rockets hit their targets can just send your requests on the exact serial numbers or over the serial numbers can be used to find out everything to find out the date of production the date of delivery whole weight the whole path of the exact piece of ammunition let me remind you that they showed fragments of videos of cruise missiles with hits in their hull we will report we were told that all the missiles hit their targets Russia is constantly groundlessly accused of everything moreover they always accuse us of falsifying something and every time we provide our proof we have the facts and the arguments we have the figures and the dates and so on but now I would like to hear our us colleagues about the essence of the materials that were just presented this is not just words these are this is hard evidence I'm talking about armed aggression against a sovereign state someone should be responsible for that I will remind you a phrase that had the Defense Secretary of Great Britain said shut up and go away do you remember that now we have an answer for you come here and please explain yourself I want to remind you that today in Hague the Technical Secretariat will see the briefing of the Russian delegation it will be about the alleged chemical incident in Duma the Syrian witnesses will take part in that those people who the Western mainstream wanted to show as victims of the chemical attack they will tell what actually happened they're going to shed light on what actually happened there and the best way to do this is just to give the floor to those who our Western colleagues tried to protect I think you're going to hear a lot of interesting things because apart from the OPCW briefing there will be a brief thing for the mass media I also wanted to say that one 24th and 25th of April the Brussels Seoul the International Conference future of Syria where mr. Jadhav the Russian representative to the II took part they took stock of the financial obligations that were taken during the conference Brussels conference a year ago another objective was to take you obligations from potential sponsors we think that it's erroneous not to invite the official authorities of Syria we think that it's necessary to cooperate with the representatives of the Syrian authorities you know all the Syrian people so therefore we we've seen the participation of non-government organizations who are operative outside the territory of Syria and that's quite illogical so because of we see today that this states want to provide every assistance to people who own the territory of Syria on the territories that are not controlled by Syrian government forces such support will hurt the entire Syria and does not contribute to the settlement of the Syrian crisis and will not help to achieve the Syrian occurred and the restoration of territorial integrity of Syria but we know that a range of states are pursue the policy of unity but they want to to achieve the deeper division of Syria which we mentioned already we call on all the potential donors to establish active cooperation with legitimate government of Syria and international agencies only this approach from our point of view will help to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria and will help to achieve the normalization of situation in Syria and now let's talk another state of the region I'll talk about situation in Syria I received a lot of questions about the station in Yemen so we're talking about Yemen the state which for the first year yeah for the for the fourth year in a row is engulfed by hostilities and the situation is going in a negative way according to all the available data which was confirmed by the Houthi enteral on the 19th of April the missile and bomb attack killed the head of the self-proclaimed supreme political Council this attack killed his the head of this council mr. awesome and his successor is al Mashhad the Houthi authorities in sana promised to revenge for the death of their leaders which is full with the anticipation of military clashes all the inter are all along the entire front including the border area with the Saudi Arabia at the same time we received reports about the fact that indiscriminate attacks of the so-called coalition target civilians several days ago 56 people died and dozens of civilians were injured the recent example with the tragedy in the Yemeni Provencal Hodja as a result of the shelling of the wedding in the night on the 23rd of April 20 people died including women and children we believe that it's necessary to confirm our position that military solution to the Yemeni crisis is counterproductive reliance on force will exist about the will exacerbate the situation and will only cause more suffering to the Yemenis and it only first ferns the prospect for political settlement of this crisis and as we said there is no alternative to it we go on three sides to the conflict to strictly comply with the international unity law and to leave aside the escalation of hostilities and to listen eventually to the opinion of the Yemenis who are tired of the war and numerous hardships we proceed from the idea that the Yemenis protagonists should break the vicious cycle of violence and start negotiations so that they could arrange the future political structure of their country on the basis of mutual consideration of their interests and concerns only in this way Yemen could be put back on a peaceful track and could achieve a national Eckerd now let's talk comprehensive plan of action and the situation around it we're deeply concerned about it particularly I'm talking about these statements made by US and French presidents with respect for the Iranian deal we have said repeatedly that any possibilities to make changes into that document is impossible so the nuclear deal is a balanced mechanism which takes into consideration interests of all parties to the deal so making imbalances in this document will lead to serious consequences of international security and non-proliferation well sue believe that it's important to remind everyone of the fact that this document has become result of arrangement on which delegations of the states worked in an official level together for a long period of time and this document has become a result of a compromise and political arrangements so we don't think that we should stick to separate arrangements that might be reached between the European troika and the United States because we are going to analyze them whether with relation to their constituency and the UN Security Council documents if the US and the European troika will achieve a compromise on certain aspects of the document we will do in the following way we will continue to stick to the obligations until other practice on doing the same now I'd like to comment the report of the State Department on adherence to in compliance with arms control non-proliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments we paid attention to another report published by the US State Department when adherence to in compliance with arms control non-proliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments every year the United States guided by their own ideas of their uniqueness and impeccability particularly when it comes to the observance of commitments of the international law take up the role of the global policeman and they see who who is complying with the international agreements and who is not and at the same time they ignore all the mechanisms of monitoring verification truth establishment and dispute settlements which shows how the how the United States respect globally accepted rules of conduct and cooperation between states this situation is absurd because all the materials published by the State Department are about the compliance with the international agreements and all the mechanism enshrined in the international agreements are ignored by the United States it's absurd but this is the reality in which we are living today so bearing in mind this documents they they have the same form they have the same style Russia is accused of many violations but the US doesn't feel obliged to provide in evidence in support of their arguments it seems that Washington believes that they could balance out the lack of evidence with their patronizing tone and their self-righteousness but the distribution of such reports is cynical bearing in mind numerous violations of international obligations by the United States itself bearing in particularly when it comes to non-proliferation regime and drug and arms control let alone the use of force against sovereign states without the UN Security Council sanction and without exercising the right for self-defense which is the blatant violation of the UN Charter I'll repeat it's absurd but that's life we're living in today I'm not going to list all the violations committed by the United States you can find this materials on the official website of our ministry we published them on the 24th of April the material is called about the Russia's estimations about the you know US State Department's report this is a huge material so I offer you to read it thoroughly I also would like to call the United States to abandon this indecent practice of putting forward for faced accusations against other states particularly bearing in mind their own behavior in this area these are just clumsy attempts to mislead the international community we hope that Washington will prefer a more civilized way to settle all the pending issues particularly through professional mutually respectful dialogue we hope that they wouldn't use public rhetoric and power projection by their own discretion yesterday you all witnessed thanks to our social media accounts what's going on with the Consulate General since here so we're calling it a former consulate generals because the US authorities withdrew their constant to the operation of this Consulate General but we weren't deprived of the property right at the same time I need to say I've mentioned already that this illegal take over all our property was planned by the I'm talking about the residents of the Consul General in Seattle and yesterday we saw it online you can find it on the Internet and I would like to talk about this matter in greater detail you remember the decision issued by youth authorities to expel to win to expel sixty Russian diplomats they announced it on the 26th of March they continued their reckless policy aimed to undermine our lateral relations which started during the Obama administration so diplomat had to leave the territory of the Consulate General on the 1st of April the last diplomats left on the 24th of April after that the agent self US security services invaded I don't have any other words for that invaded the residence of the Consul General we actually are where US colleagues tried to explain that wasn't invasion but this is a real invasion because this is a property of the Russian Federation for which we page at the time and we paid for it we maintained that place this is a real invasion the fact that the US authorities withdrew their consent does not deprive the Russian Federation of their property and if it happens to other states other states should understand that it does not deprive them of their property rights so the u.s. security agents entered there without any authorization they literally break broke in they literally broke into the building after that they searched everything so they used all the necessary infrastructure for that the building was conserved by the Russian Federation but the US representatives lured it in that building so they acted like they did it in the end of the twenty sixteen on the territory of the Russian property which was owned by the Russian embassy in Washington they did the same and they can't sue a generals in San Francisco talking about two buildings to be exact they acted in the same way in the trade mission in Washington's last autumn as of today the US authorities invaded six diplomatic facilities I repeat I'm talking about diplomatic property of the Russian Federation this is shameful outrageous and unprecedented situation we have never witnessed that in history in the history of our the lateral relations we see a gross violation committed by the United States of fundamental international norms particularly under conventional diplomatic relations Vienna Convention on consular relations and the lateral consular convent convention maroa we usually don't comment that issue but bearing in mind the legislation of the United States the US authorities cannot find any document that could make their action legal they don't have such documents this is a decision taken by security services or maybe authorities that's a question that we have for the United States what's the mechanism mechanism do you take in the decision-making process particularly when it comes to legal takeover of property of other states who do you please show us a document we don't need anything we don't need your words we don't need your emotions just please sure what the document quote the document give a reference to us on which document do you take over illegally the property that's owned by another state as you know in response to the actions taken by Washington Russia had to take retaliatory measures and on the 29th of March Russia declared the same number of US diplomats as persona non grata well so with true constant for the opening of the Consulate General of the United States in saint-petersburg US diplomats should leave st. Petersburg up to the 30th of April I need to say that the residence of consul general and Consulate General are not owned by the United States and not owned by the United States I need to say that they are owned by the municipal authorities of st. Petersburg so we're saying that no one is taking anything away from the US side I'm not not even saying that we organized any searches in another in their buildings we insist on the return of Russian property invaded by the United States we cannot even have an access in order to make sure that all the systems are working I need to say that all this maintenance systems are exploited by the US authorities US officials recommended Russia to sell this property they made it in an elegant way please sell it and moreover we have received an offer to help us they offered us the help to sell this property an interesting way to do that we hope that the international community will pay attention to the mugging which was conducted by the US authorities and also I would like to pay attention to the facts I'll ask my colleagues to show you the photos you see you see the Seattle the 25th of April it does that surreal photograph this is a real footage take a look at blue this is a blanket or a blue sheet and behind it there is an officer u.s. officer our special services who broke into the door you must be interested why he did that why did he need such it is guys such blue shit we also have this question maybe this is a special agent or maybe he is contracted for these special purpose but is the first time that we see that behind some turned behind some sheet someone were trying to break into the property and it was a metal work undertaken in order to break this fence and these are the images and this is footage video when another lock has being installed why are we so accustomed to this large scale of provocations this is a local scale you see here and you lock has been fixed it's been placed by Americans so you see here the activities on the territory of the consulate you can see this they are approaching the central door of the building I just like to say that these people on the territory owned by the Russian Federation they became history maybe the person was trying to caught a fence defenses bars he maybe after some time he will remember the things that they did illegally when they violated their own laws I did not know the way they were persuaded to do this but after some time maybe they will tell their children that they were made they illegally intruded into the property of other states but it was also the backdoor that was used for this intrusion so this is a work done about the infrastructure that I have mentioned the building was sealed and now the water supply was also blocked because when our employees were living at the building they did everything to conserve the building when it is when people are not present in this building so they tried it to open the tubes to open this system we do not know why this is not an American building this is our property and this is a voter that I would call the embodiment of legality thank you very much and concluding I would like to develop on the comment that was led by our us colleagues of from the US Department they wrote that today it was about yesterday the US State Department officials went through the Consul General of Russia in settled to confirm that it hadn't liberated but it had not been seized they also write that they would ensure the security and comply with the obligations what obligations they were referring to yes has obligations before Russia and they abused their obligations we also have talks about that the seizure had not taken any place and also just affirm lawful response to Russia's continued and outrageous behavior and of the code have two questions if we speak about legality just show us the law on the basis of which these seizure has taken place if you are speaking about the trager's behavior of Russia would also like to see the facts and the evidence now we just have a fabric recent fabrication by the US regarding the illegal strikes against a sovereign state and if our colleagues in the State Department published such materials and say that it is normal practice that it is legal maybe we should come to their place and we will see their reaction if it is lawful and okay next question next topic there are many questions asked to command the prospect of Russian Cuban relations with regard to the changes in the other government changes and the leadership the policy aligning our ties and was confirmed during the telephone call between the President of Russia and the president of the new National Council of for the National Council of Cuba these are relations being maintained in a consistent way and we have we have a friendly relations and we maintain open and transparent dialogue and we are allies in there are many changes are being undertaken in Cuba and they relate to the new pattern undertaken by the government of Cuba and there are long-term projects implemented in the energy metrology and infrastructure areas and there are including others of the construction of energy of logs and the rehabilitation of all the material on our infrastructure and we also build in our cooperation in medicine pharmaceutical sphere and other areas this testifies to the solid basis of our corporation that we have and this is good at human for the future that gives us at optimism in assessing the future of our relations and also noted their comments are for the president of France regarding the Balkans it was announced during the Strasbourg meeting he said that the European Union should attract the Balkan states in order from prevent them form from floating so it's Russia and two other countries this is a chair political was presented as a geopolitical risk for the European Union excuse me for these emotions but we have a question that adrift thirteenth I was Russia as it was said by mr. Mottram is it all concerning the fact that France is concerned about but doesn't France concerned about the British adrift and about the geological risk for the European Union because Balkans the Balkans geographically and physically is a part of the common conquer the continent and Great Britain is an island these statements demonstrate that not all of the states here European states can perceive of the Western Balkans as an equal partner with it's legitimate interests and its international ties and we believe erroneous the logic of T of setting out for this durability culture is that between Russian antique the European Union we should maybe recall of the Western mineral partnerships this rhetoric games can come out to reopen the unhealed wounds of the context of the 90s I'd like to say that Russia doesn't see the Balkans as a geopolitical training area and who would not be engaged in a tug-of-war with the European Union and the European Union should find a way to maintain its contacts with Russia and its traditional partners and balance in these context next topic I'd like to return to the situation in the sports sports area and the principal of sports without politics is being eroded more and more and the anti-russian campaign that has been undertaken by Western countries also affected this area and the doping scandal provoked against Russian athletes and an admission of our many green efforts to the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang they are among them and we also heard call set of organs to boycott the World Cup that will be conducted in Russia these political arguments and has nothing to do with the actual sport and it was a situation that our freestyle wrestling team suffered came across with because the United States rejected the issuance of leases to the whole team and just denied access to these competition and the same thing happened with the Iranian team and basing on its political interest the yes say studied her to choose the team so that would take part in the competition this is a flagrant our violation for the hosting country that will conduct such competition in order to prevent to this in the future we need to their regulations correspond to regulations and we should also speak about this in the resolution of the competent authorities and we believe that we would need to unite peoples and nations and politics should destroy the obstacles that people have created including in the area of sport I cannot but comment the statement by remarks are by the famous Dutch writer is this a writer of the book and the successor it is we are speaking about mr. moon and call this heir and successor book was devoted to the life of the family during the Second World War it was also working now for some media outlets in this country Sunday program built in health in its local TV channel he discussed the groundless critics of Western countries against Russia this negative trend was initiated by all the countries of the north antic Alliance and this was also followed by the notch meant of an inator blocker to the east he also raised the question about the fact that the West comparison to his official statements conducts a different kind of policy towards the form of Soviet republics and it tried to bring a divide between now these territories and it is not my words his situation of lisa dodged all for these the result of this stretch that became the complex in Georgia Moldova and Ukraine we can speak about the annexation of Crimea but we cannot but recognize that the Crimea became a part of Ukraine by due to the decision of our leadership but nevertheless it remained Russian in essence he also called awkward to the accusation in cyberattacks of cyberattacks and interference in the internal affairs against Russia and he also said that Russia is undergoing a systematic such attacks it is a painting of a man who are working a long time in our country and he knows has the in first-hand information I'd like also to command the situation around Russian citizen mr. mell we are doing this regularly again we are quite concerned by the unacceptable situation around our Russian citizens who's in the Italian prison for the involvement in the events of 13th of June 1991 his health condition is also a cause for concern he is suffering from a chronic disease and for four years he is in prison under fetch charges and we call our Lithuanian partners to ease a pre-trial restriction for men and replace them by non-custodial measure this record by that started by an illness in 1991 this is a vicious was for transit or historical revenge and historical revisionism and taken into account this photo sized decision and two manipulations the sake of the Lithuanian interests this is a great blow against the justice in Lithuania as a member of the US and the European Convention on Human Rights and we will seek for district compliance with the relevant documents and compliance with that other's interests and we hope that abandon politicized decision and would respect the supremacy of law and its international obligations now the topic I would like to speak about the detention of the activists in the checkpoint of Schengen and the crimean traffic the special urania services are detained the head for the charge organization madam in eval she was charged with treason and with subversive activities against Ukraine that so to be punishable by 12 or 15 years in prison the she's also blamed for being a person representing that represented the president during the Arab champagne and all everyone know so what those claims are based on the information been qualified and the list of pre-investigation preliminary esthetician this information is not the year and since then the give doesn't need any justice party needs its needs another scandal regarding our citizens and they may be afraid of Crimean citizens for the choice they made and they may be are ready to punish anyone pertaining to the Crimean population it is not an accident that mr. poroshenko suggested depriving the Crimea population about the Ukrainian citizenship this is activists about the volunteers of freedom and this accident how which happened not a coincidence and the supporters of shukhevich and Bandera they despise everyone who can find the victory of our people they're writing about the history and work they are working against the veterans Russia condenser the adverse reaction against madame novel and to the embassy our Embassy in Ukraine closely monitoring the situation and controlling these situation yeah brushing a present we should also take note of the recent address of the president of Ukraine to the patriarch of Constantinople suggesting the creation of a certain United local Orthodox Church in Ukraine with an autonomous status the current Ukrainian authorities side making an attempt to create a fully controlled pocket Church which will be composed of unrecognized heretic structures any attempts to implement this scenario with very different reaction among the clergy goes against the interests of the people of Ukraine this might significantly aggravate the political situation and provoke additional difficulties in the society the Ukrainian authorities who are performing a total Ukrainian of the country while using the slogans of the fight for independence now using the religious issues for their own interests they are directly violating the Constitution supposedly they also trying to rewrite the Orthodox can on the scales have the appetizer growing a report is about to be published on the website called neo Nazism a challenge to human rights democracy and the rule of law this report is meant to draw the attention to the current problems of xenophobia and intolerance in the number of countries of the world we're talking about the more than very dangerous manifestations of race in which should be contracted on the Nash on international levels number of states have examples of glorifying Nazis men the former members of the waffen-ss they are opening monuments and memorials they conduct public manifestations in order to glorify the Nazi past the Nazi movement in neo-nazis such actions are not the implementation of the freedom of association this is an abuse of this freedom as well as the right to the freedom of expression these actions are subject to article 4 of the International Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination according to which the participant states should have should criminalize such actions we cannot accept the arguments of this country saying that the manifestations of waffen-ss and glorifying of different kinds of Nazism of collaboration ISM and the facts of interacting monuments the Nazis and other actions are supposedly simply an implementation of the above-mentioned freedoms and of course we should mention the blasphemous war against monuments in a number of countries the war against the monuments that those who liberated the world from fascism I think that the democratically mature countries should fight against such sentiments they should not abuse the unlimited right to freedom of speech you all are welcome to read the text of report and the countries mentioned in the report should draw their own conclusions and perhaps change their policy and as I promised I wanted to mention the events which are planned by the Russian foreign missions to celebrate the anniversary of the victory this year celebrating the anniversary of the victory we're playing in a number of events abroad outside of Russia in more than 80 countries said the initiatives of the Russian compatriot organizations supported by the russian foreign missions the immortal regiment marches will take place as well as the georgian st. George ribbon in more than 90 states moreover in China Republic of Korea in mongolia during the immortal regiment there will also be an event thank you for victory which symbolizes the unity of generations countries and people wrath will be laid to the tombs of those who fell in the fight against nazis and concerts and manifestations and festivals of wartime songs and other events will take

kitchens available and we're expecting that the events in the another come in the other countries will also be attended by the local citizens the veterans the members of the anti-fascist organizations

on the red square with the heads of foreign diplomatic missions and representatives of international organizations accredited in Moscow it's worth noting that in a number of countries including post-soviet ones and friendly Syria it's become a good tradition to broadcast the parade they march on the red square live on Central TV channels our citizens and our compatriots now have an opportunity to join the atmosphere of the great holiday we are sure that the celebrations will be very interesting they will attract a number of citizens who are interested in preserving our historical memory we hope that the authorities of the countries hosting these celebrations will provide their support and aid and will honor the memory of those who defeated Nazis and we would like to read through a thrushes position that it is unacceptable to rewrite the results of World War two her version of the results of this most destructive war and the previous events and the attempts to rehabilitate Nazism and to fragment the responsibility and changing the role of the Soviet Union in defeating Nazis in the fight against the monuments to the heroes all of this would seriously affect the situation in the world and all of this is very dangerous due to the negative consequences that this might result in we go against any new divisions in Europe we support the construction of a common European house without the division on our on the friends and foes and this year when we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Munich Agreement which became a for the World War two we should think about the unacceptability of new tragic events in Europe similar to those that happened in 1939 1945 and now I am ready to answer your questions yes please naturally we begin with our colleagues from Armenia thank you very much you said during the meeting of Sergey Lavrov whether mean in foreign minister they discuss the situation on the contact line I would like to ask you whether they discussed it in the light of the Armenian events whether they discussed the prospects of further cooperation between the diplomatic missions and foreign ministers of the two countries you know this question is rather bizarre and strange we have contacts with Yerevan the contact was not severed I cannot understand what to cause your question calls the embassies are active in both Moscow and Yerevan and I cannot even understand what motivated your questions I'm talking about the possible changes changes in what where changes in the Romanian authorities you know we proceed from the understanding that we have the people of the Russian Federation and the people of Armenia and it is for these people for their own good and prosperity we have diplomats it's not the people who should adapt we the diplomats of all categories and types should think how to make sure that our countries and our people can live better and build a better future for us keeping in mind the historically good and friendly links that we have everything that are dependent on the Russian Federation to make sure that these links and ties are oriented into the future is being done and I think you cannot accuse us of anything here these are the matters of bilateral relations these are the matters of regional problems which are unfortunately a serious wound for the relevant countries for Armenia and for Azerbaijan as well we act in accordance with our obligations yes please I forgot how to use the mic maria vladimirovna I was asking about the proposal of France England and Germany on certain additions to the Iran nuclear deal in essence the Iran missile program and certain regional problems of the Middle East these are different topics not only this does not only concern the nuclear deal we would like to hear the details about your opinion as well as your opinion on the declaration of mr. de Mistura that he thought that the astronaut process has depleted its resource that it does not go anywhere nothing will come out of it we would like to hear your valuable comments as for the first point I have talked about it in great detail I can repeat that unfortunately not only during the previous years but we could say for decades we have seen constant instability of the positions of our western part towards Iran globally not only about the Iran nuclear program as you know better than me this is a matter of the relations with this state we have heard different evaluations from Washington from other European countries and the amplitude was so large they went from the necessity of carrying out strikes simply strikes as we've seen that by their smart rockets perhaps they were not so smart back then and they justified their plans they went from this possible strikes to the concept of talks and negotiations and thank God common sense prevailed and perhaps back then they had fresh memories of the events in Iraq and Libya and other regions they have shown what these actions result in but still common sense prevailed and they resorted to talks which resulted in the relevant deal the way it is qualified by our Western colleagues when they deal was made and let me remind you that they motivated a construction of the European and ballistic missile defense by the Iran Threat and Moscow was asking the question whether this issue could be closed since a nuclear program was under control and everything was fine but they said that no even though the ballistic missile defense in Europe was motivated by the Iran Threat it was not covered by the deal this is an absolutely different issue you know there's a good expression when an artist is carrying out its illusions and tricks and they say watch my hands the situation is the same we should always watch their hands listen to what our Western partners say because in particular we talk about a deal and the position they're constantly cheating they're changing their positions they're constantly changing the motivation and the reasons which are declared to motivate their actions I call on everyone just imagine that if the concept of strikes against Iran was implemented and these are the same people who are now coming back on the political arena or coming back to the white house establishment these are the people who were saying that strikes should be carried out against Iran can you imagine if they actually went on with the strikes they insisted that Iran was a threat to international stability international stability and unfortunately it was threatened by absolutely different countries and we see the results of this policy now from Syria to Libya this is all evident these are the examples of the strikes carried out by the US by Britain and France so here we should all understand that unfortunately this is the reality the changing position of the US and a number of states which have been seen by for a long time and the second point let me remind you that less than a year ago in autumn during the session of the UN General Assembly there was a meeting of the countries who were behind the negotiation process for the deal and back then all the suggestions to review and change the document made by the US war rejected and refuted they were harshly criticized in particular by France and Germany and the European Union what happened in six months as we know nothing changed with Iran as far as the implementation is concerned we know well that the experts observing the implementation of the program constantly confirmed that Iran is carrying out all the conditions and obligations and everything is being clarified they have common work on the issue so what happened if the deal hasn't changed the Iran hasn't changed so what happened to the countries in particular the European wise why did they change their position what are the arguments of Washington to justify and convince them these are not the arguments connected with the analysis and expert evaluations these are different arguments if they had any analytical input they would show that they they would say that Iran did not comply with the deal that Iran did not answer questions but that's not the case so they found different arguments what are the arguments perhaps you could ask these questions a good question concerning the statement made by mr. de Mistura that there's no process is ineffective I want to say that less than a week ago several days ago mr. de Mistura visited Moscow and he made other statements about the Istana process so we are quite perplexed by what was said because we have a question concerning the reoccurrence of the change of approaches on the Geneva platform when we see mr. de Mistura says one thing and then he goes to Europe and says another thing can it be can it happen to the Geneva platform when they say one thing to government authorities and they say another thing to the Syrian opposition maybe that's why the Geneva process is stalling for so many years we were really confused bearing in mind different evaluations about the process that we discussed with mr. de Mistura in greater detail and he personally made other statements about that yes please TV and radio of nur nur vidya in the photo prison there is an origin citizen would appear again he said to his attorney that he visited Russia several times by the request of the Norwegian security service do you think that the situation will change for you doper gas and how Russia is dealing with this situation several days ago our foreign minister foreign affairs visited so Sergey Lavrov and Sergey Lavrov said that he will examine this case did he have time to examine this case you know we cannot examine it because investigation is still in process we can refer our request to norwegia we can refer your requests to law enforcement agencies but I need to remind you that investigation is still in process I can say that I really paid attention to statements made by his lawyers and I specified that according to our information the Norwegian subject has account has received consular diplomats we haven't heard any complaints about the detention conditions I can say that he's being visited by consular officers so we haven't heard any complaints from him and we haven't heard any complaints about the fact that certain pending issues weren't addressed so that we're not talking about politics here we're talking about investigation if you have any detailed the questions about the detention conditions then we can give you contacts of the law enforcement agencies press service so that you can ask your questions to them I repeat that the investigation is still in process yes please I know some of our information agency Moscow Baku could you please if it's not difficult for you to provide your vehicle each evaluations about the nagorno-karabakh settlement we publish we published our commentary on that matter and I would like to say that the settlement process is still relevant and as many other states and regions and other countries we're closely following the situation in Armenia with which we share historic traditions of friendship and cooperation the large-scale comprehensive cooperation with Armenia we share our Allied cooperation we hope that situation will develop in legal and constitutional field and all political forces will show their responsibility and willingness to hold a constructive dialogue we strongly believe that they returning to normality and the restoration of social cohesion is within the interests of the brotherly Armenia I would like also to add that we bear in mind that there are all the possibilities in in the media to know how the world lives what actually happened in different states in different times I think that our information awareness shouldn't exist just this way we should understand the consequences of various events so I need to repeat that we proceed from the basic principles that I just mentioned that I just mentioned so could really specify you think that the situation will stabilized and both parties will return to negotiations we truly hope for that and we proceed from that yes please this negative casa hello mr. harbour may will mark the hundredth anniversary of their dependence of Azerbaijan Republic which in trying to the principles of the Azerbaijan statehood we allow Maidan marcbot chef is the founder of azerbaijan bearing this in mind what could you please about Azerbaijan and Azerbaijani diplomacy it seems to me that you didn't visit our briefings quite often your colleague

Harbach hello the Korean TV radio tomorrow we'll see the inter-korean summit we'll ask you to comment the initiative of the South Korea green President to sign a peaceful agreement with North Korea if the agreement to be signed then it would mean the stability in the region what's your relations about the future in the of that and the future in the region we have given our evaluations on that we proceed from the idea that the intra Korean summit is sought after event in the relations between North and South Korea we support all this in diplomatic efforts on that track taking interested taking into consideration the international history of that issue we hope that all the international actors involved in that situation truly want to achieve a solution that they don't want to aggravate the situation we wish all the success to that event and we will give our evaluations following this event after the two Koreas will share their evaluations and of the outcomes of that event yes please information age agency Eurasia daily could you please a comment the statement made by the new president of Montenegro about their intentions to change relations with the Russian Federation can can it be helped by concerning the volve meant the alleged involvement of the Russian Federation into the attempted military coup he shouldn't just have aggravated this relations that's all I can say yes please yeah me yes you Kuipers k zebra state TV channel is asking could you please tell you about the level of relations between Cyprus and Russia we are going to publish this materials on the website and representatives of the public opinion often expressed a concern over the relations close relations between Turkey and Russia particularly concerning the sale of s400 and the construction of power plant in Turkey I'm not saying I shouldn't say that we improve our relations with other states in order to aggravate our relations with in other states I know that this question can sense the public opinion of Cyprus I want to say that I want to express the clear position of Russia that we're interested in comprehensive cooperation where Cyprus would develop our relations in many fields but we also develop our relations with other countries with which we are in a geographical proximity with the country with the countries with which we share a complicated historic past we also develop called the the cooperation that we developed with Turkey it's not going to have a negative impact on our relations with Cyprus and I have another question you mentioned in the course of your briefing about the outer cephalus Church in Ukraine according to the Greece media US diplomacy is very interested in the Orthodox Church the US ambassador in Athens he was the four member and Roger of the United States and Kia he expresses greater interest in the Orthodox Church as for the constitutional Pullip Petrarca do we see an involvement of the US diplomacy I think that it's up to the church to decide and the comment that we made today that's not an attempt to interfere into their faith of the church we just we are just making an attempt to wound Ukraine mccrane that is trying to influence all these affairs we made a comment to warn the international community about the fact that the church has its own rules and Ukraine is trying to interfere into the face of the church and Ukraine is doing it without concealing its political intentions it brings me to my second point I need to say that US diplomacy is very interested in the Orthodox Church today and I think that we see the interference of the United States into domestic affairs of some countries which include those countries that preach Orthodox Church as full Orthodox religion and as for the Ukrainian action we have said repeatedly that all these actions are supported by political forces and political figures particularly from the u.s. they try to influence the financial political economic decisions they're also trying to exert their influence that will aggravate the public life in Ukraine they pursue one goal I have said it all violent Akron ization they want to they want to tear choice of the Ukrainian population with the outer world this goes against and it contravenes their own constitution that's I was just talking about today yes please hello mr. Harbor Breeze Anza media mas Bulgaria yes I recognized you I have two questions during your briefing you mentioned the Vulcan State and Crimea Crimea was visited one of the leading parties of Bulgaria with its leader and also Crimea was visited by one of the representatives of the Bulgarian leadership they all advocated against sanctions Thanks sanctions against Crimea they also put forward an idea to launch a lorry ferry between Crimea and the continent what's your perspective on that we have repeatedly visited Crimea we have first seen new infrastructure new airports but in Crimea we haven't found any government facilities I'm talking about the Russian posts virbank it seems that Russia supports sanctions imposed against it and it really has a negative influence on people living there because and we're concerned about it because many vulgaris living there and concerned so what was your questioned about so first what's your idea about the what's your view and the idea put forward by the Bulgarian side to launch a ferry that's the question that should be posed to local authorities you're talking about infrastructure we support we support the intensification of cooperation of this region of the Russian Federation and we support in this occasion of its international choice so we support any activity of Crimea that is aimed to improve its infrastructure but as for details we need to work you need to work with relevant bodies and second and while you're asking me you should have posed this question to Crimea since you visited that region you should ask us you should have asked them about the feasibility of that project this the decisions that should be taken by local authorities and together with federal authorities and if the decision is taking then the ministry will implement them so it seems to me that creamy and is Russian but I don't see there the Russian post I don't see if there is Burbank office there are many a lot of state organizations you cannot even imagine the number of them represented there there are many issues that's why we invite you there but we readily are working on them thank you yes please the Japanese TV company Asahi TV mr. Harvey tomorrow North Korean South Korea going to meet each other so what are Russian relations about that and and expectations about that but your colleague has already asked that question but maybe you have any expectations I already mentioned them so the second question is is it possible to resume the six-party talks on North Korea I think we need to wait for the political arrangements if if this is a result of the future intricate inter-korean summit we should look at the outcomes of the summit Russia is ready and not only ready Russia is very active on that track we organized meetings on that matter and we are doing our best to make our contribution to the peaceful settlement of this old issue but these plans should the commented only after the organization of this meetings do you have any more questions yes please me or him just arrange it son of Sarek TV channel the leader of the Armenian revolution question yon match with the Russian ambassador Ivanova Lincoln and mr. Banyon said that this protests in their media were not organized against Russia then the US ambassador Richard Nell's met with the current uncle pity on the Prime Minister over Mena and the US ambassador repeated the words of mr. Carpathian that the Prime Minister over Minear shouldn't be chosen on the streets there should be some constitutional mechanisms set up so I have a question can we have any can super powers set out their preferences particularly judging by mr. nails we can say that they do not support a position they support the present authorities and the second question there was a meeting between mr. Naryshkin who's the head of the external intelligence services and their representatives of Azerbaijan mr. relief and concurrently mr. Ali you've met with Turkey could you say that this the situation is told I'm talking about the nagorno-karabakh conflict talking about the first question bearing in mind the wedding of the question itself whom the superpower support you know it's just not appropriate to ask this question particularly for the foramina for their Armenian people these people have their own mentioned history they have their own statehood which exists for many years and we have an immediately said about it that the people of Armenia which should address this political crisis themselves these situations occur in many states and the question is how people and those so to whom people delegate their power it depends on how they show their wisdom in order to address the situation in a peaceful way without violence or maybe to turn it into a protracted process with the horrendous results we proceed from the idea that since it's a domestic affair over media and based on the international law based on the law of life Armenia should develop consensus and should come towards the social Eggert they should choose themselves who should go in their country we mentioned already that the law the legislation of this state should be at the heart of these sections the contacts I maintained this is a normal practice we don't see any we don't see anything strange in that as I've just said already when I was answering the question already that's absolutely okay to maintain contacts between the ministries and the ambassadors it's an internal affair over meaning of the Armenian people they created their own country so they should find forces to find a political solution on the basis of their legislation and in the framework of their constitution the second question was about the possibility to aggravate the situation Nagorny Karabakh crisis we don't think that should take place our position we have voiced our position many times that's a question of political arrangements and so all the complexities that you mentioned they shouldn't occur it's not going it's if it can only lead to there's a servation of the situation but we hope that this will be organized in a peaceful way Afghan news agency a Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia at the CE SS CEO summit declared that ihe was concerned with the number of terrorists in Afghanistan and the here was upon all of the sources doing the best to prevent the war in Afghanistan Sherri's war war in Afghanistan so well yeah well of the closure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization a lead to the settlement in Afghanistan and to not see the logic how this closure can lead to the improvement of the situation because this organization is uniting the neighbors of this country it was a partially created to solve for such issues and very influential feel the work is anti-terrorism work and it is not about theoretical discussion on the way to find some analytical responses to these questions this is a programmatic cooperation held on a daily basis with the countries that participate in this association maybe I'm not quite aware what you mean but the security will not be multiplied by this much closure but of course the trends that we see now not regarding them joining but the move from and assess from North Africa to this region this processor can be neutralized and the work is carried out and it is a substantive work maybe you were asking about something else because I have got the answer to my question do you have any question questions yes good afternoon does a Russia has any hope that the Syrian crisis can be settled another question do you have any information to the Kurds that there are about the Syrian Liberation Army it's moving the people a tool even of the houses of Kurds removed from the places in Efrain does Russia has any data on that Syrian Liberation Army wants to change Adam Appalachian of offering and the Kurds that ax left their houses the Libyan the Liberation Army the move Arabs are to live in their homes I can only specify because I do not have any information on the this issue is there any hope to the Syrian crisis to go into its settlement I would say that we've already mentioned that that these chaotic and not logical first site activities our Western partners the attacks and the shelling of was in Syria under the exploitation of the problem in topic of the provocation of the use of chemical weapons this is an indication that Syria taken it's a way to the settlement for the crisis such strange actions at the same time well understand that there are no evidence and that the materials used as a basis protects for the attacks they can not be reliable they are falsified this everything is used for this crisis to be prolonged so this is I think the answer to your question if you do not have any other questions oh yes I see BBC good afternoon maybe we have missed that that point but do you have an assessment regarding the events that developing in Armenia that have led to the living of mr. Saxon and your commenting like that you hope that the situation in Armenia would be a solved based on the international law but as for this event the living of mr. Saxon as a result of the pros at the protests you really miss that is internal affair of Armenia it was it illegal it is a question relating to the social affairs within state it's not an issue that should be discussed and commented that officially level is a question to political scientists to historians who should make their comments on the trends that have led to these events but the question is that it is an issue internal issue of Armenia and but we urge all the bodies to show wisdom and to show responsible approach to the settlement of the situation in their constitutional frame but the elections in Armenia I think this question should be asked to the government of Armenia and we proceeded from the fact that we witnessed such a situation there's living of his post of mr. Sarkis on the declared by garrymon and this is a clear-cut position we think this is not a situation that implies any double doublespeak Interfax informed that the first as president I said premier and also the Prime Minister of Amenia they came to Moscow and Lavrov held that meeting I do not have details regarding this meeting I only have the information that I presented to you it's surprising that this meeting was taken as some kind of conspiracy so now when happens it and in details but as for more information I will specify it it is it was declared that the situation in Armenia was also to be discussed during the meeting that's why we asked such questions I've commented in the first part of the briefing and I can double check on the details yes please international news agency nice one Bulgarian from Bulgaria is it a short technical issue are any there any standards in international diplomacy regarding a number of diplomatic workers in this or that country today you talked about their reader seizure in operational diplomatic property but as for Armenia the diplomatic mission the as diplomatic mission the year is the biggest one about 900 workers are there and who can decide it in the number of diplomatic workers each side agrees upon the number of diplomatic employees that should be sent to this or that country should stay in the territory of a specific country if there are any complications in the relations there is a parity principle when status is unfriendly actions and done in order to somehow respond to these unfriendly actions it proposes a parity principle and this was our case and this was a example with the United States and they had more diplomats in our country and the diplomatic workers the number is larger than the workers of any other countries then started the expulsion and this seizure of a Russian property and diplomatic missions so we proposed the parity this equal number we have a representation permanent mission Russia to the end and we have different kind of thing with it different kind of symbolism traditionally I would say that this this is a great upon a bilateral basis under the opening out for the consulate general consul generals and the embassies it's also the subject of bilateral agreements based on the conventions of the 60s this is the legal base framework and all the details are being consulted with each of the side thank you next to next briefing
