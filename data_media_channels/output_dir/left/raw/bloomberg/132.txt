1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,890
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likes to brag
about nuclear weapons...

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,250
His country is thought to possess as many
as 20 nuclear warheads.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,199
Kim’s military has successfully tested a
wide variety of missiles, and, according to

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,270
defense analysts, has moved closer to its
aim of producing both a missile capable of

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,820
reaching north america and a nuclear warhead
compact enough to ride on it.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,210
That’s why neighboring countries and the
U.S are all watching North Korea and its unpredictable

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,600
leader very closely.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,020
Trump: It will be solved you can bet on that

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,800
Here’s the situation.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:38,629
On september 9th, 2016, North Korea conducted
its strongest nuclear weapons test in a decade.

11
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:44,710
The 10 kiloton underground blast was almost
as powerful as the U.S. Bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,390
And in 2017 Kim Jong-Un warned of more nuclear
weapons tests, stepped up ballistic missile

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,010
testing, with some landing in the sea of japan,
and promised to test long-range missiles that

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,260
could reach north america.

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,360
In response, U.S. President donald trump said
he would consider all options.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,420
we're probably not safe over here if he gets the long range missiles we're not safe either

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,180
After meeting with china’s president Xi
Jinping in april, trump agreed to work with

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,480
Beijing to find diplomatic solutions.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,010
He later warned of a major, major conflict
with north korea should diplomacy fail.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,350
In April the U.S. Installed a missile defense
system in South Korea.

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,200
And the chinese are not happy about having
the system’s surveillance capabilities in

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,650
their backyard.

23
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,320
China, North Korea’s only significant trade
partner, has been pressuring the country and

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,300
has suspended its coal purchases from there.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,520
But the chinese are reluctant to push so hard
as to risk the collapse of north korea’s

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
government.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,840
Meanwhile both south and north korea have
hundreds of thousands of troops deployed on

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,630
either side of the border.

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,530
Here’s the argument.

30
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,520
North Korea has a long history of escalating,
and then de-escalating tensions in order to

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,260
broker economic and diplomatic concessions.

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,250
Which leaves the U.S., and the world, in a
tricky position.

33
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,670
Most diplomatic situations call for a carrot
or stick approach.

34
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,010
Unfortunately, with North Korea, neither the
carrot, in the form of aid, nor the stick,

35
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,980
in the form of sanctions, has worked.

36
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,560
What’s left on the table is ever-stronger
sanctions, awaiting the downfall of the kim

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,800
dynasty, or military confrontation that risks
enormous casualties.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,510
But doing nothing is dangerous, especially
considering kim’s erratic behavior.

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,020
He has executed top advisers including his
own uncle.

40
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,010
A senior defector went so far as to say that
as long as kim is in power, the country would

41
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,200
never give up its nuclear weapons, “even
if it’s offered $1 trillion or $10 trillion

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:00:00,000
in rewards.”
