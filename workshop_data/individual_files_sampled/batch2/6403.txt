Rudy Guiliani just joined Trump's legal defense team in the past couple of days basically and he's already making breakthroughs in the case for the other side he was on Sean Hannity show last night and when he was asked about the payments that Michael Cohen Trump's lawyer had made to stormy Daniels one of the porn stars that Trump had an affair with he revealed something new sigilyph having having something to do with paying some stormy Daniels woman 130,000 I mean which is gonna turn out to be perfectly legal that money was not campaign money sorry I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know it's not campaign money no campaign finance violation so they funneled it through the law firm funnel throw offer him and the president repaid it oh I didn't know that he did yeah there's no campaign finance law zero that is great my I mean everything everybody John I said it is but I left Sean Hayes oh no you just revealed way too much please just read the cards exactly you're not ripped new info so the reason that is significant is because of course up until this point everyone involved in this story has denied that Trump knew anything about this or that he had repaid Michael Cohen which I found very plausible because he doesn't pay people Michael Cohen had said he'd never been reimbursed Trump said he had no knowledge of this whatsoever Sarah how give me Sanders and said there's no knowledge and then suddenly casually Rudy Giuliani the new guy the new B comes out and says no he was repaid he was repaid and also so this was part of a string of a whole bunch of interviews doing started with Sean Hannity it was there were actually the majority of this and it was by 30 minutes straight of them talking was about Kobe well mostly Muller and the investigation how he's gonna make sure he counsels the president not to speak or whether or not they will speak with Muller under certain conditions what about what the Clintons going through yeah what about what we don't make sure this isn't a purge trap again we're getting the why that doesn't make any sense how concerned about your president lying about what he did but that's the concern not that he might lie but that they might set him up to lie yeah it's real easy if he's not gonna lie then answer the questions truthfully I thought that's what we do in a mannequin yeah Giuliani had it seemed a couple of agendas right one was to dirty up the investigation which he did and as you say he was kind of on a media tour to do just that right to run down the Special Counsel and to essentially buttress the idea that the investigation is a witch-hunt and it's so far off course that has become a tainted by a lot of government involvement and a government overreach is the way he might put it in in perhaps not those words but suggestion if the that this entire thing is now taking on a political tone well of course what he's doing is a purely political exercise yeah and then he's trying to clear Trump from the idea that there is collusion and that's why he was try and and campaign problems and that's why he was getting into that soundbite that we just heard right but it leaves open the door for obstruction of justice yeah he thought that he simply had to lay out that it wasn't campaign funding and that we wrapped the whole thing up he paid him back not realizing that each part of that also opened up Trump to a more legal jeopardy now I realize that many of you watching this are not shocked to find out that Donald Trump is lying about something even lying about potential law breaking but for those who are maybe new to this haven't been paying attention for the past year I want to make it very clear let's play this next video where you're going to see Donald Trump totally denying any knowledge of this sort of thing so he didn't know anything about it even though apparently by the time he was asked that question he had already paid for it paid for it and paid more paid for the taxes on it and all of that you mentioned that he was on Rudy Giuliani was on a media tour part of that was an interview at The Washington Post where he was asked by Robert Costa when was the president told about these payments and Giuliani said he wasn't since it was somewhere between ten and five days before the election and he wasn't told but even if he was told he wouldn't have remembered it so that's an airtight case they got there like I wouldn't have remembered it also I don't remember it all so where am I paid out personal funds which covered that and possibly a few other things that you know would be considered incidental I would love to find out what those other things are but and then they tried to craft this thing where they had a retainer that he was being paid out of but that's not what retainers for lawyers are I feel like these guys have only like heard about retainers on TV shows or something it's not for repayment of totally non legal non-campaign personal expenses of it doesn't make any sense so these so these kinds of things the lie of course has to evolve but in this case devolve because of once you say the first line and people go hey well that doesn't really make much sense there Rudolph that's not how this may work because that's a problem you may have cleared there one aspect and we'll get to what some ethics former ethics heads have said about what this did lead to now you have to change your story to the next step so no oh man my bad that's right he knew he knew about paying something back just not about exactly what it is so I can keep my veil over he didn't know what was going on then there was some non-disclosure agreement which we still haven't talked about yet how it for why he did or did not sign it now that is also up in the air it's as you mentioned John mentioned the right for me came on there's now this dust cloud of a dusty lie and now you have to try to decipher as you look through all the cloud what part of it is true what part of it is not what part of our half lies one part of half-truths but after you come for whatever you come up with they then go well not that part just the 25% of that part and another 35% of this part is what's true so now we just confused two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're at uoit subscriber and second is ring the bell
