now a campaign to reverse the brexit vote has received a hefty boost from American business magnate George Soros best for Britain has confirmed he donated almost half a million pounds through his foundation George Soros foundations have along with a number of other major donors also made significant contributions to our work indeed through his foundations he has contributed four hundred thousand pounds his funding is one among many sources let's get more details now from anastacio chiquinha and now CEO what do we know what this money will go towards exactly well Niki indeed quite a hefty sum seems to have been contributed by the American billionaire George Soros to the anti brexit cause really now this group that he contributed the money to is called best for Britain there pro-eu lobbying group and their main idea is not even support for a soft brexit but they want to see a second referendum one of their key ideas is lead not leave the EU and they work to try to target public opinion as well as MPs who have potential influence in the process the group was co-founded by Gina Miller who at one point took the UK government to court over the issue of triggering article 50 and one and despite the group saying that these contributions from George Soros are not as significant as the amount the total amount they've seen from smaller donations made to them privately it seems to be really clear that four hundred thousand pounds is a bit of a bigger amount than say for example the 73 P that Facebook said Russia had spent around the time of the referendum on brexit and just staying with the issue of influence we do know that the UK is about to see a launch of a new anti brexit renew party which is reported to be supported from across the channel with French MPs from Emmanuel Marcos on March movement not only being an inspiration and supporting this idea but also reportedly giving advice to this movement we don't have much time the only way of winning is by the same miracle as mackerel so it seems possible that sometimes sources of influence are a little bit different from the ones that so many people seem to be hell-bent on believing as the source of interference from abroad
