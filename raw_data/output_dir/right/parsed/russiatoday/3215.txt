an antique purchase in a Moscow market
gave one French woman more than she
bargained for it was only when she got
her Soviet camera home that she made an
interesting discovery
sixteen beautiful pictures
black-and-white pictures which were all
about a boy which were apparently an
important moment of his life so I've got
to found him to give his photos back to
him
yeah I was at the airport when my friend
send me a photo of a little boy who
looked very much like me with a caption
saying looking for a Russian boy there
were so many questions where do these
photos come from and why is someone
looking for me who is this Elizabeth and
how did she get those photos
well he found me really
I got a whatsapp message from Dimitri
saying I'm the Russian boy you are
looking for in the end I decided to call
her via Skype and we talked for two
hours about everything she turned out to
be a very nice woman
it turned out that my uncle had given it
to his friend to sell at the market but
he had forgotten to remove the film
pretty bloody Elizabeth is planning to
come here in February to visit all those
places in the photos she has written an
amazing film script for this story
that's going to be turned into a
documentary I will do my best to help
her the idea would be to use a camera
the literal camera which is a key object
in all that story and use it as a
character and really follow you know the
path of the camera and go back to the
places where the picture were taken
I'm not looking for fame I just want to
share this amazing story with other
people so that others might realize that
our life is not just about politics and
death but includes room for small
everyday pleasures
