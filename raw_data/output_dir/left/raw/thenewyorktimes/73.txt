[phone ringing]

2
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,596
Rapid response hotline.

3
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:40,860
Yes, do you help
all immigrants,

4
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,150
or just Spanish,
Arabic, and Chinese?

5
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:49,310
Uh, is this an ICE raid?

6
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,562
Pardon?

7
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:53,810
Are you calling 
about an ICE raid?

8
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,770
Potential.

9
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,050
I’m just concerned.

10
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,880
I’m from a European country.

11
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,290
I’m here illegally
and I wondered

12
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,020
if you help Europeans
or just Spanish, Arabic,

13
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,100
and Chinese.

14
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,830
We help anyone who is
involved with an ICE raid.

15
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,905
But is there an ICE raid
happening right now?

16
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:18,367
I imagine.

17
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:19,700
This is an
emergency line, sir.

18
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,366
Can you please call
if there’s an ICE —

19
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,750
Well, I, like, I’m
having an emergency.

20
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,910
I am having an emergency.

21
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,389
There’s a bunch of illegal
people in our country

22
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,180
that shouldn’t be here
and assholes like —

23
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,124
[dial tone]

24
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:36,614
[phone ringing]

25
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:37,655
Rapid response hotline.

26
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:41,930
You guys are going to have
some big surprises when

27
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,750
you go for certain raids.

28
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,850
You are going to get
some nice surprises,

29
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,010
you traitor [expletive].

30
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:09,797
[phone ringing]

31
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,310
Hi, San Francisco
Rapid Response Hotline.

32
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:47,910
Hi.

33
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,790
I own a restaurant and had a
few customers in here eating,

34
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,280
and they left, and they were
saying because of immigration

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,640
or ICE was on
24th and Mission.

36
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,540
This was about — I want
to say 20 minutes ago.

37
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,655
24th and Mission?

38
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,030
Well, the lady
got a phone call.

39
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,217
And she got a phone call, and
her whole facial expression

40
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:08,050
changed, and I was like,
is everything O.K.?

41
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,767
She was like, I have
to go, I have to go.

42
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,100
And there were
six other tables,

43
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,605
and I guess she told
them, so everyone left.

44
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,635
And how many customers
left the establishment?

45
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:18,740
That left, were 10.

46
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,240
Damn.

47
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,828
O.K. Your whole
restaurant left?

48
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,500
[phone ringing]

49
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,180
Hi, San Francisco
Rapid Response Hotline.

50
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,870
Hi there.

51
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,530
I’m at Mission — or
sorry, 2nd and Jessie

52
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,900
and there is a
Homeland Security

53
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,540
federal protective
police car sitting here.

54
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,406
I don’t see anybody.

55
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:46,780
I don’t see any ICE guys, but
this is a Homeland Security

56
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,070
car.

57
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,690
Oh wait, here they are, police D.H.S.

58
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,190
Oh.

59
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,268
It looks like they’re
on their lunch break.

60
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,426
[laughter]

61
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:58,501
(SINGING) Don’t
give up hope.

62
00:05:58,501 --> 00:05:59,995
Don’t give up hope.

63
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:01,489
You’re not alone.

64
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:02,983
You’re not alone.

65
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:04,484
Don’t you give up.

66
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:09,120
Hi, I wanted to confirm
that there was ICE activity

67
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,630
in the Mission today.

68
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,690
So we’ve been receiving a
large volume of calls today,

69
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,470
reports about 24th and
Mission, 14th and Mission,

70
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,310
Marshall Elementary, and
the Foods Co in the Bayview

71
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,280
and the Foods Co
here in the Mission.

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,550
We’ve sent dispatchers to
all sites, no ICE activity.

73
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,177
They’ve all been
false alarms.

74
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:31,706
(SINGING) Look up ahead.

75
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:33,155
Look past despair.

76
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,087
Look past despair.

77
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:39,890
You gotta put one foot in
front of the other, and —

78
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,869
Hi, San Francisco
Rapid Response Hotline.

79
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,160
Yeah, I have a couple of
friends who are undocumented,

80
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,451
and they’re trying not to
draw attention to themselves,

81
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,760
but they’re wondering
if ICE does show up

82
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,900
in their neighborhood, and we
got the numbers from the news

83
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,580
to call, but
they’re unclear as

84
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,830
to exactly what your
organization will do.

85
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,800
Will they stop the
raids from happening?

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,900
Well, the fact is, that
when enforcement is happening

87
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,935
we can’t actually stop
it from happening.

88
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,270
But I thought you guys
stopped it from happening.

89
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,280
That’s what we
were looking for.

90
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,290
No I don’t think that
there’s any entity that

91
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,840
would be able to do
that, to actually stop

92
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,624
the enforcement —

93
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:17,540
Yeah, and you know
what’s really unfortunate,

94
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,200
I was talking to my friend,
is that because California

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,760
had made these sanctuaries,
they’ve called attention

96
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
to themselves, and
that is unfortunate.

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,864
This may have not
even been happening

98
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,780
if they never announced
that and bolstered it.

99
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,655
At least that’s what my
friends are thinking.

100
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,440
It’s like they
just caused it —

101
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,370
they just, they just made ICE
focus in on these places,

102
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,740
which is unfortunate.

103
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,150
It seems like it’s backfiring.

104
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,563
It’s crazy.

105
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,635
Yeah.

106
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:43,270
I hate it.

107
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,519
I thought the sanctuary
city stopped ICE.

108
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,750
No, no, no.

109
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,700
That’s not exactly
what sanctuary does.

110
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,697
[phone ringing]

111
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:01,030
Hello, Rapid
Response Hotline.

112
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,320
I’m calling because
my uncle was detained

113
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,775
by ICE on 24th and Mission.

114
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:14,105
He has already been taken?

115
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,480
Yeah, he has been taken.

116
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,910
Migration, I think, it was
there, on 24th and Mission.

117
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,926
24th and Mission.

118
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:25,270
O.K. just a second.

119
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,475
Do you know how old he is?

120
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:34,298
He was born on
November 2, 1952 — 1958.

121
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:38,429
Do you know what his status
was when he was taken?

122
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,053
[phone ringing]

123
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:40,832
Oh, his status?

124
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,183
— Hang up or press one.

125
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,470
Hello.

126
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,090
Hello?

127
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,400
You have a call from an
inmate in the Yuba County

128
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,905
Jail.

129
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,790
This call is from a
corrections facility

130
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,562
and is subject to
monitoring and recording.

131
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:56,210
Hello?

132
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,046
(SINGING) Lord prepare
me to be a sanctuary

133
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:14,468
Pure and holy,
tried and true-

134
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:15,456
[phone ringing]

135
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:18,690
With thanksgiving —

136
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,662
Good morning, Rapid
Response, how can I help you?

137
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,620
Didn’t you know it was
against the federal law

138
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,261
to harbor illegal immigrants?

139
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,760
Is this an emergency?

140
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,340
No.

141
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,212
Just keeping your lines busy.

142
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:44,230
(SINGING) Pure and
holy, tried and true.

143
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:51,350
With thanksgiving
I’ll be a living

144
00:10:51,350 --> 00:00:00,000
sanctuary for you.
