talk radio used to be the no-holds-barred free speech place because people could call in anonymously and have the confidence to say things that were politically incorrect because it's not like a letter to the editor we have to sign your name like anyone can call in that's why talk radio was such a free place but tell me a little bit about the changes in toronto media over the last few months oh my god you know in the last year i I've seen it particularly in the last six months so last week I had a gig with Talk 640 course really popular radio stations Ron the John Oakley show I followed him from the morning gig to the afternoon I've been doing it for over 15 years even when I clashed with people like Adam Vaughan and Joe Fiorito of the star I was a regular for over 15 years then all of a sudden without warning last week I was ditched along with three other conservative Jesus mark Stein who and then cam the he does sort of humorous stuff so what were any liberal sack two or just used Stein skis as in camp no no absolutely so that's how you see not about cost that's about ideology I believe absolutely it's about ideology it's about muting conservative voices what I found particularly disheartening is that it was done three and a half weeks before the election the municipal election in which we do not have you know good conservative voices out there talking about well that's the thing I mean we're on the eve of a city election you cover the city beat and this kind of stuff and your your reports on the drug injection sites and the the a lot of the goofy attempts left-wing attempts to handle crime issues for you to be sacked three weeks before the election when you're coming the election beat along with only conservatives it looks to me like this is I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist but no it's a clear message as it was a clear message to me and it was a clear message to John Oakley who had nothing to do with it I have to say that outright he fought for me but it's a clear message that you know conservative voices are not welcome and becoming increasingly unwelcome in the media now I mean we've talked before about the other media that have been including cp24 CBC and it's been sort of a steady evolution I never thought it would happen on talk 6:40 but since they were taken over by global this is what's occurred well I tell you it's I think we're in the era when these gatekeepers of the legacy media don't have enough gates because I mean we're on the internet but there's podcast there's there's YouTube there's so many alternative media there's Twitter it's a shame not being on terrestrial radio but I think that your message and the message of other concerns will get out and it takes a little more effort by listeners but once they find alternatives to why would they listen to boring radio that's been Vanilla fide why would you even bother well you know I think that they are deluding themselves if they think that the message is not getting out and they're deluding themselves if they think that they can actually manipulate public sentiment by doing things like this and I will go so far as to say that because I think there is a real attempt to present only one side of the story a very blend a pobla mised side of the story and I think they're really really deluding themselves if they think people aren't more in tune and astute to this kind of thing that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra lavance show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
