1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,670
when asked by looking back in time to
Hurricane sandy after that hit in the

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,460
Northeast in 2012 the federal government
spent 56 billion dollars on relief

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,320
efforts and on Friday the Trump
administration asked Congress for 7.85

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,650
billion in initial hurricane funding
relief given the devastation caused by

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,849
the storm well seven billion dollars B
even close to enough money from the

6
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:33,420
federal government well den a will not
be however is is very clear that the

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,739
president has made it clear Congress is
making it clear this is just a down

8
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,790
payment but let's not compare it to
Sandy let's compare it to Katrina listen

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,010
the population size and the geographic
size is far larger than Katrina and I

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,920
think sandy combined we have over five
million people who are affected by this

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,160
it's not just the flag in Houston
it's the hurricane swath all the way

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,010
from Corpus Christi over to Beaumont and
so it's gonna require even more than

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,790
what was funded for Katrina which was
about a hundred and twenty billion

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,740
dollars but in addition to that listen
we are trying to work to rebuild the

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,840
state of Texas ourselves and that is why
we have created this new fund the state

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,030
of Texas runs called rebuild Texas orgas
is rebuild TX dot o-r-g and people want

17
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,930
to help join this effort let me make
sure I understand you I know it's very

18
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,020
early and it's hard to know dollar
figures down the road but you're saying

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,369
that you believe the federal government
will need to give north of a hundred

20
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,579
billion dollars yeah in the overall
equation that the cost of this if I

21
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,110
understand it correctly to rebuild
Katrina was over a hundred and twenty

22
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,979
billion dollars and when you consider
the magnitude of the size of this storm

23
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,409
is far larger than Katrina and and both
geographically and population wise and

24
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,979
when you look at the number of homes
that have been mowed down and destroyed

25
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,630
and damaged this is going to be a huge
catastrophe that people need to come to

26
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,580
grips with it's gonna take years for us
to be able to overcome this challenge

27
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,760
let's talk about what's going on in the
ground right now the the waters are

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,890
receding in Texas people returning to
their

29
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,160
homes that have been devastated only 15%
of houses in Harris County which include

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,830
Houston have flood insurance what's
gonna happen to those people governor

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,910
well let me first say one thing I'll
answer that but remember this the water

32
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,230
is over sitting and drying up in Houston
in Harris County but remember there are

33
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,140
so many other parts of the state of
Texas that are impacted by this such as

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,709
the Beaumont region and some other
reasons than the lower Brazos River we

35
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,540
are still doing search-and-rescue
missions as waters have not yet received

36
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,500
and I've even come close to resetting so
we are still in phase one of responding

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,300
to the emergencies but as it comes to
the homeowners in Harris County in

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,290
Houston Texas were the most dramatic and
widespread flooding took place we're

39
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,739
working on multiple levels to make sure
that these homeowners are going to be

40
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,510
taken care of one thing one way in which
the Trump administration has been very

41
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,950
very responsive is by having older
cabinet members as well as the FEMA

42
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,180
administrator in Texas constantly
including yesterday and so we are

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,709
working on strategies to help these
homeowners are be able to have an

44
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,850
effective response for them The
Associated Press reported this weekend

45
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,239
that 13 of the 41 contaminated Superfund
sites in Texas were flooded and are now

46
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,010
experiencing possible damage as a result
of the hurricane when will the EPA

47
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,190
inspect all 13 of these sites well the
EPA has been very aggressive about being

48
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,120
involved in this and they are working on
some of them already as you probably

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,430
have noted they have restraints on their
ability to check out some of them just

50
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,750
simply because of the water but they're
prepared to go in as quickly as possible

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,220
and and what threat do you think this
poses in all honesty to public health of

52
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,850
your constituents well this is just one
of a multitude of dangerous to public

53
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,239
health because of the flooding waters
listen people as they begin the cleanup

54
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,290
process they need to realize those as
these waters have flowed through their

55
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,579
homes and other parts of the county it's
not just what you're talking about there

56
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,320
but these waters are filled both with
chemicals with wastes and things like

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,430
that they can pose real health hazards
and so we caution everybody

58
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,229
as you begin the the rebuild and
clean-out process understand that your

59
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,729
homes your buildings and areas any area
where the flooding waters have come

60
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:40,979
across your property there is a
potential very dangerous dirt and grime

61
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,960
left behind so should people wait to
know the answers to what really is left

62
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,500
behind before they go back Hey No
as we toured around Houston yesterday

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,389
and went through neighborhoods we saw in
typical Texas fashion people are already

64
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,150
getting back to work and they are
cleaning out their houses what people

65
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,860
need to do is they just need to be very
cautious in the way that respond do

66
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,360
things like wear gloves wear masks wear
clothing so that your skin is not going

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,620
to be brushing up against what you're
cleaning but people can go back to the

68
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,009
homes and begin the rebuilding process
like what we've seen across the state of

69
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:22,020
Texas already and we're so impressed
with the work ethic of our fellow Texans

70
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,590
about getting back and going to the
rebuilding process governor Abbott thank

71
00:05:25,590 --> 00:00:00,000
you so much thank you
