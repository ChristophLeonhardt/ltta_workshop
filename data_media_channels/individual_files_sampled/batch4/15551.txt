tonight in the last of our long-form special interviews over this Christmas season we spend time with Daniel Pipes who's been studying the Middle East for nearly 50 years that's ahead on the Revel why should others go to jail one you're a biggest carbon consumer I know there's 8,500 customers here and you won't give them an answer you come here once a year with the sign and you feel morally superior the only thing I have to say government welcome back well one of our Sherpas as we climb the Mount Everest of our understanding sorry for that awful analogy one of our guides as we try and figure out the complicated part of the world that is the Middle East is our friend dr. Daniel Pipes with the Middle East forum he's a scholar a man who has spent a lot of time in Arabia in fact studying in Arabic in Cairo and has been a bridge of understanding to the West he worked in the Reagan administration and we have a Reagan like president in some ways in terms of his commitment to principles in the White House again so we thought that we would take today's long form interview that we've been doing all week and spend it with dr. Daniel Pipes and he joins us now via Skype Isaac called you a Sherpa on our Himalayas of understanding forgive me for that but it's true it's so huge the the issue of the Middle East you're helping us figure it out one compliment thank you you have been studying this issue since the 70s tell me and remind our viewers a little bit about your background you actually went to Cairo I believe you're Jewish but you went to Cairo to study as a student where times different back then was it was Cairo a little bit more liberal a little bit more secular or is cairo eternal the same as it's always been a technically i began in the 62 september 60 not so doing this for almost 50 years the Cairo is definitely more secular when I was there in the early in mid seventies I the Islamist movement was just getting going the kind of jams and burkas in the country see today were virtually absent indeed symbolically I lived on a street called hava a shot are we and hold a shot Ali was a woman in the 1920s was came back from Europe and threw off her coverings and she was a feminist heroine and I lived on her Street it's still named that way but it's a it's an era gone by it's very changed it's not good now I've never been to Cairo of course but it seems to be such an enormous city that it's a world unto itself sort of how places like New York or London are described give me one more minute about what the culture was likely is it a is it a polyglot City are there people from all different backgrounds and languages there or is it pretty much just the boss City of Arabia and Egypt is it is it a place where new ideas and art and science are bubbling up is it is it a creative place what was it like then and what's it like now it was pre 1950 to 1952 was the military revolution of the Nasser Sadat barring Sisi it has become as one might expect under military rule for over 60 years 65 years now a very desolate place there there are a few arts there are few sciences there's little going on but it was it was in the old day it's a place for movies for songs for scholarship and the like so it is it is a dreary place and intellectually emotionally and often Egyptians who have a spark will go off to pop Dhabi or to Europe or to North America it is not not a cent not a place where where things are happening well I want to move off of Egypt in a moment I mean it's interesting to me because you spend time there and of course the place has obviously changed there's all places to overtime Egypt was in many ways it's the most important arab country from perhaps with the exception of Saudi Arabia Hosni Mubarak who was so permanent he's like those mighty stone faces on Easter Island always there until he wasn't until he was toppled in the street protests in the Arab Spring and then a Muslim Brotherhood radical Mohammad Morsi took power and started really careening the country to an Islamist regime until the people and the army took back now they have a president al-sisi did did Egypt come back from a near-death experience there where is Egypt on a stable path now does it have any economic Hope is al Sisi more reformist they seem more tolerant of Christians and even more open to Israel my view is the 1952 as I just suggested is the decisive date that's when the military took over is very much still in charge the generals might take off their uniforms but they're still generals and they in fact over the decades in increase increasingly control of the economy and other aspects of Egyptian life it's rather dreary it's military planta for 65 years there was a one-year break when Mohamed Morsi was in charge in 2012-13 but even then the military was ultimately the ruler it just let him do it and when they had enough of them they got rid of him so it's military rule ad nauseam it's still there it's hardly changed I really see CC as a younger version of generation younger version of Mubarak I don't think he's doing a very good job I think he's repressive I think he is not fair towards the Christians he has taken a few steps which are possible to be sure especially with the currency but overall Egypt continues on its down slide perhaps the single most interesting important fact about YouTube is that it is the world's largest consumer cereals of grains more voters Egypt than to any other country they can't feed themselves what was one that once the breadbasket hooked not this now you know unable to treat itself and it isn't changing it isn't good enough I see hunger and indeed starvation in Egypt's future oh that's incredible and it of course is a in terms of population it is an enormous country there was a moment in time let's let's just hop around the region a little bit I mean there was a moment in time where they called Beirut Lebanon the Paris of the Middle East and there was a moment very very briefly where there seemed to be some harmony between the Muslims and the Christians and there was it was almost like they would rotate the prime ministership or the presidency if I recall and it was a touch of Europe a touch of the Mediterranean is there any place in Arabia where there where a liberal tolerant peaceful civilian society has taken root is there any place that's a flicker of hope or is that region just doomed just one small correction and eleven on the positions of president prime minister and so forth are fixed by community they don't they don't hit by yes there is a more important level someplace we're hoping that's Abu Dhabi and Dubai in particular to a lesser extent other shapes of the Persian Gulf but I'm W Devine are they're not exactly democracies they have their problems what is so far is that as there is cultural innovation insofar as they're in this section now make progress indeed military they're growing stronger of papadum Dubai United Arab Emirates is the place to and that's not a spots I mean they have they're doing also so interesting and in some cases extravagant things well but really I mean there was two places you mentioned they're still quite small I mean they're impressive world's tallest tower the Burj Khalifa you mentioned the lot Lebanon has 4 million people UAE ten-nine be okay right most of those people ate nice list people are farms but still it's 10 million people there you have it I mean you have a perhaps a princely class I mean it's the same thing with a lot of these tiny oil-rich regimes even even cut her itself even Saudi Arabia in so many of these are you don't know but hmm but it's the place for Egyptians and others to go to you know make money into physics it is it answers your question yes there is a place yeah Isis false but it is the place I visited Singapore our once very briefly and that's a very multiracial multi-religious city-state and it seems harmonious they have a very very stern approach to Islamic radicalism they crack down on it at the first whiff of it they shut down any hate preachers in mosques and it's it's it reminds me of in some ways Communist China in terms of the we want to make money but we don't want any political shenanigans it's it's freer than China but they managed to keep a lid on it is that the best we can hope for for Arabia to have sort of a benign dictator who immediately snuffs out Islamic extremism is that the best case you're gonna get a Dubai at this point is and it's noteworthy that the UAE a few months a few years ago declared the Council on american-islamic relations to be a terrorist school this is nobody else no other government has done that at this point I think a benign dictator is about as good as we can expect but I have hopes that over time that will evolve one person made a very interesting analogy but just as you go to the doctor and you're given a prescription you don't really know what it's all about you just take it because the doctor knows better so in places like the new way he they see the leaders as knowing about politics they know you don't you follow what they do it's not quite perfect but I think it does explain the attitude one finds a rather a political minute we've we've talked a bit over the course of the year of how Donald Trump has tried to change the traditional ruts and routines of the International diplomatic and political approach to the region one of the things that Trump I think is changing is he's removing the Palestinian dispute as the central challenge and I think that's wise I mean when I was in Israel in March I learned that all of the arab-israeli Wars and terrorism combined the total number of casualties on both sides over the last hundred years is a hundred thousand people now obviously that's a disaster that's a tragedy that's that's horrific but compared to just you know the civil war in Syria that's like six months of the Syrian death toll that's I'm sure they're they've exceeded that in Yemen the iran-iraq war so I mean just from a statistical and geographical and demographic point of view to invest so much in the palestinian-israeli dispute really was a distraction a placebo I don't know like a like a sleight of hand a misdirection from the larger problems there I actually did a study with a German scholar Gunnar Heinsohn a little over a decade ago that we looked at all international conflicts since 1945 and the arab-israeli conflict came in number 49 if I remember correctly the number of deaths was about 80,000 so yes it's way down and below many conflicts you never heard of it is not a major conflict from the point of view of fatalities it is a major conflict from the point of view of the international system what the what the Eastern question was in the 19th century the arab-israeli conflict is today it involves so many act so many states and non States it's fascinating it has implications that say for the oil market so I wouldn't miss it entirely it is not meaningless but in especially for these days when there are such major Wars going to Libya and Yemen and Syria this pales in significance or impales in in size - well I think you're wise to point out the oil question I mean Israel was the excuse or the fig leaf for the OPEC cartels to double and then double again the price so you know and it's been remarked endlessly that the Palestinian refugees well you know they're third generations living in the same town I've seen these refugee camps with my own eyes what we call refugee camps looks to the eye like a town with apartments and schools and you know it's been 75 years or 70 years and the point is I think that the issue is kept alive purposefully so that it can excuse OPEC so that it can be a way for let's say Russia to a triangulate against the West like there's so many other things that in a way use the Palestinians as pawns or or cannon fodder or whatever some people say that Jerusalem is the heart of the arab-israeli conflict I say no it's these so-called palestine refugees who as you point out are refugees onto the generations who have children grandchildren and children who are still supposedly refugees but it's even worse than that how's the Palestine refugees who take the nationality safe of dirt on Jordan are still refugees they the Palestine refugees so-called who live in the Gaza and the West Bank are still although by our country's policy our own are still refugees it's preposterous is evil it's the dank heart of the Arabs only conflict that I might say that my organization Middle East farm has been working for some years now and trying to change our government's policies and to say ok we'll give me money we like to kind of stop the money but we will not consider your beneficence you are you are no longer refugees any good by the way - unworthy United Nations organization that it deals with these refugees are there some six million and there are because children gradually but according to above our estimate some twenty or thirty thousand and getting small very very well I've seen studies by the Pew Research Center which is a reputable and liberal Research Center does a lot of international polling that I think it has a good reputation for accuracy I don't know what your view is the Pew Research Center tests different subjects and the cultural attitudes of the countries surrounding Israel Jordan Turkey Lebanon I don't think pew has done surveys in Syria makes me believe that peace between Israel and its neighbors will be unlikely to be achieved if they're if it was the will of the street the arab street now i don't know if that will is never actually expressed because they're not democracies around there but if you have generations of anti-semitic hate pumped into society through government speeches through the media through kids textbooks if you've had 70 years of demonizing Israel and Jews as as not even humanists subhuman or Devils if you have rampant conspiracy theories that aids is a plot from the Israeli military for example I mean they do crazy crazy conspiracy theories can there ever be peace if you have one two three generations and frankly going all the way back to the Koran which has strict punishments for in for those can there ever be a lasting peace let alone of friendship between the Jewish state of Israel and the hundreds of millions of Muslim Arabs had surrounded well peace actually divides it to two is what one might call the warm peace in the cold peace warm peace is say Canada United States there are no soldiers along the border if there is plenty of trade as the emotion of conflict the armed conflict is out of the question they call peace is where two states artists tandem and they are at peace because the implications of using force are not attracted at the moment but they couldn't be at another moment I think what one can hopeful between Israel and the neighboring states is colle peace and that's what they've had with Jordan and Egypt for some decades now making the long run will improve but you know what Cole peace is good yeah so long as never uses force that is it so last week there was a vote in the United Nations the General Assembly every country in the world was given a vote to condemn the United States move to announce that it will relocate its embassy to Jerusalem as opposed to Tel Aviv where it is now I was a symbolic vote but almost every single country in the region voted to condemn America including America's allies like Saudi Arabia we have that image on the screen we showed it last week the United Arab Emirates one of the moderate States we're talking about countries that receive enormous funds from the United States obviously Jordan obviously Egypt these are countries that have peace treaties with Israel they all voted to condemn maybe this was just a symbolic vote and why should any of those countries have been different but but is there a possibility that for example the new Saudi prince who seems to be taking on sacred cows arrested a bunch of billionaires has said he's going to take on Islamic extremism oh wait and see is there any hope that a true moral political religious Geographic military leader in the region like the Prince of Saudi ray we're not going to build our whole worldview around hating and defeating Israel anymore we're just not going to I mean this UN vote seems it's the same as it ever was but is there any chance of a breakthrough with this new sati prince and Donald Trump's encouragement I think there is it's very new is doing a lot of things as you pointed out foreign affinities Social Affairs religious affairs economic you name it it's it's a revolution in the making in Saudi Arabia and he has indicated clearly that he's not interested in the palestinian-israeli calm we have this publicly we have it privately it's not his concern however if he's faced with the UN vote he has to go on with it or else he'll be in big trouble he's got so much on his plate would it be wise for him to abstain from this Nora thinks we can't create more hostility towards so yeah one sharks one citizen he had to do that but there are more important things going on and maybe someday his government from he's only 32 he could be around for very long time his government would abstain but for now one indulges it and says we understand you had to do this but it is exciting did I compare it to the Meiji Restoration in Japan the audit Earth's revolution in Turkey this is a profound change that he's undertaking everybody think all of us is astonished can he pull it off I don't know but if he does it will have profound implications for Saudi Arabia but also region and deep Muslim you know when Trump made his announcement on the embassy I surveyed as many media outlets around the world as I could see as many government statements around the world the Turkish president was probably the most virulent and outraged in his reply Egypt's Saudi Arabia Jordan their comments almost seemed lawyerly well we object to this and that liked it liked it there was no fire or blood there there weren't mass protests around the region that just weren't I wouldn't go further and say that none of the Arabic speaking countries were fired up over this it was a Ron and Turkey and I explained it like and but here's here's the other side of that coin the outrage from the Western left the the most Christian led the Swedes the European Union the the Brits the The Guardian newspaper the the outrage from non-muslim Western leftist was you know five alarm fire I mean it was shocking to me and even frankly from some Jewish leftists I as a Jew I was deeply embarrassed to see the front page Heth headline in Haaretz which is a leftist paper in Israel that said president Trump don't do us any favors and I thought really if if America stopped doing Israel favors Israel might not even exist anymore I mean I don't know if that's a fortune 22 but you're pointing to is a shift that's taking place that's quite monumental which is that among Muslims the opinion about anti-zionism this has fractured there are those who are as a designer sever but there others who are not and generally the trend is away from it and monitor Salman the study conference is one major actor in there on the left in Contra missed the hostility and focus on this'll just increases an ASUS it wasn't that way just a few decades ago it wasn't so strong just a decade ago and it's getting stronger and stronger but one word symbol of this is quote Jeremy Corbyn the leader of the Opposition in Britain is obsessed buddhism and deeply deeply hostile to the point of supporting the murderers of israel's this is a transformation and how far it's gonna go how long it's going to last to come no idea what antidote that might be to it i don't know so the good news is the muscle opinion is frank turing the bad news is that they'd left us to be in this court yeah I again referring to pea research just because they do so much of this work and I do find it reputable they measure the Muslim population of Sweden had just over 8% and they project that if Sweden's current immigration policy holds that number will be as high as 30% next generation 30% is in fact I would call that a working majority even though it's not obviously majority and I have talked about this before you said well that's still 70 percent on the other side well if it's a 30 percent that's young and vigorous and vocal any no Muslim politician knows they have to court that to win with whatever fraction of an of the non-muslim vote they have so I think if you've got a 30 percent block you're basically an operating de facto majority and Sui I can see your disagreement see but I this is okay but let me put that I think you I point to you what just happened in Austria October 15th with the elections mid-december the two leading parties formed a coalition it is premise on what is delicately called any immigration policies but which are really handy as long as Asia that they have 58 percent of the vote between it that's roughly the seventy percent you're talking to if the 70 percent gets together on this it's not good okay I accept that and I hope that that happens but if it doesn't and of course 30 percent then becomes 35 becomes 40 then becomes 50 over time if I'm sir I'm not just stopped I mean unless it's staffed as you point out I'm worried that the locus the center of anti-semitism will sweep over the West Europe I feel it coming to Canada I think Donald Trump is a bit of a bulwark in the United States and I think demographically the United States is is in a better position but I am worried that we are headed into a darker age where Western liberal enlightenment values are being replaced by Sharia style or Sharia sympathizing values a blend a Frankenstein blend of leftism and Sharia light that is dangerous for anyone who loves Liberty and dangerous for historical enemies of Islam Jews and Christians yes well broadly speaking anti-semitism has moved from the right to the left and from the Christian world to the Muslim this is a fundamental set of changes in the last 17 years and the fact that substantial numbers of Muslims are coming to the rest means that that change is being felt on a daily basis in in the West for example Canada's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian immigrants any idea where they are is one manifestation of that it has major implications in part for Jews but also for Christians for atheists for gays and for many millions well doctor pipes I tell you that that's a pessimistic and the despairing note and I feel like I and so many of my shows that way let me throw the last word to you but I don't think that is the last word I think there is also a resistance that's developing to this that is growing and I note Austria which is now in the vanguard of trying to change things let's see how they do I think Austria is worth a lot of attention because if they fail have many implications as they succeed these little has been all right well that's something to look forward to we have talked about Austria on the show before and we did talk about this coalition and the young president over there we will come back to that subject in 2018 they have a very high Islam Islam offical rate already I think they're at 7% ahead of the UK just behind France and Sweden so they have a big challenge dr pipes it's great to spend some time with you today thank you as you have done with us so many times in 2017 and hopefully 2018 will be a year of resistance to the transformation look look forward to that thank you very much that's dr. Daniel Pipes of the Middle East forum that's our show for today that's our last long-form interview of this week I hope you've had a Merry Christmas and I wish you a Happy New Year and we'll see you in 2018 I'll be half of all of us here at rebel world headquarters thank you for joining us this year thank you for being a Premium Member your subscription is what keeps us going we get no money from the government or any large corporate source like that so it's you thank you for keeping us around and Happy New Year goodnight and keep fighting for freedom
