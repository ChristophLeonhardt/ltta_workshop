1
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,410
“White House experience
really helps refine

2
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,130
what one might call
one’s ‘b.s. detector’

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,130
for determining when
the executive branch might

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,570
be exaggerating or misstating
how things actually work,

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,490
or the problems that
would supposedly

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,709
ensue from a particular
legal interpretation.

7
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:35,010
It gives you great respect
for the presidency.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,343
But that doesn’t translate
into undue deference.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,400
When Justice Kennedy
says something,

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,740
I listen —

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,580
me and 320 million 
other Americans.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,160
If confirmed
to the D.C. Circuit,

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,840
I would follow 
Roe v. Wade

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,940
faithfully and fully,
that would be binding precedent

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,020
of the court.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,680
It’s been decided
by the Supreme Court —”

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,220
“I asked you 
your own opinion —”

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,340
“And I’m saying,
if I were confirmed

19
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:04,569
to the D.C. Circuit,
Senator,

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,610
I would follow it.

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,090
It’s been reaffirmed
many times,

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,440
including in
Planned Parenthood versus —”

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,200
“I understand.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,410
But what is your opinion?

25
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,030
You’re not 
on the bench yet.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,160
You’ve talked about
these issues in the past

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,980
to other people,

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,050
I’m sure —”

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,240
“The Supreme Court has
held repeatedly, Senator,

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,117
and I don’t think it
would be —”

31
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:19,994
“O.K. —”

32
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,160
“appropriate for me to give a
personal view on that case —”

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,490
“Not going to answer
the question.”

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,530
“He’s been one of the most 
consequential jurists

35
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,340
in American history.

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,290
No doubt about it.

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,550
And his basic idea was:
Pay attention

38
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,070
to the words of
the Constitution

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,290
and pay attention to the
words of the statutes

40
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,090
that Congress passes.

41
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,710
A very simple and 
easily conveyed idea.

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,290
But it shows how far
the Supreme Court

43
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,330
had strayed from those ideas
before Justice Scalia

44
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,055
came on the scene.

45
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,770
The Constitution is
largely a document

46
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,210
of majestic specificity
and those specific words

47
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,780
have meaning, which absent
constitutional amendment,

48
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,949
continue to bind us as
judges, legislators

49
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,950
and executive officials.

50
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,840
The federal judiciary
is really, as I said, many times —

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,010
it’s one of the crown jewels,
if not the crown jewel

52
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,690
of our
constitutional democracy

53
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,650
and it ultimately depends 
on getting

54
00:02:26,650 --> 00:00:00,000
good people willing to
become judges in our system.”
