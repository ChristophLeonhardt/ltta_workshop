the design is completely different in
the front you see a lot of more air
intakes you see a larger front spoiler
which is all done for cooling and for
downforce you see this an invented front
bonnet here where the air goes through
in order to optimize the aerodynamic
efficiency on the sides you see
something we call air curtains to guide
the air on the side and the rear you see
a big wing which is now a fixed wing in
height it can still moves and has the
air brake function but all this is done
in order to give the car a better
performance in terms of curves and
aerodynamics
