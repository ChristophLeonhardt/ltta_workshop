The following audio is
part of a conversation
with Donald Trump that his
then lawyer, Michael Cohen,
secretly recorded two months
before the 2016 election.
As you can hear, the audio 
abruptly cuts off at the end.
The two appear to be
discussing payments
to a former Playboy model
who said she had 
an affair with Trump.
There was a real 
relationship there.
There were real feelings
between the two of us.
Several things in the
exchange are in dispute
by legal teams on each side.
So, we’re not subtitling the video.
Let’s play it one
more time.
Cohen’s lawyer seems to suggest
that Trump wanted
the payment to be secret
because he wanted it in cash.
“Everybody heard just
now Donald Trump
say the word ‘cash, cash’
after Michael Cohen 
mentioned financing.
The only people who use cash
are drug dealers and mobsters.”
Trump’s lawyer says
the tape clears
the president of wrongdoing.
“The transcript makes it
quite clear at the end,
that President Trump says,
quote, ‘Don’t pay with cash.’
There's no indication of 
any crime being committed
on this date.”
So, what could the
leaked tapes show?
Trump had knowledge
about the hush payment,
although his campaign
has denied it.
The use of cash may
have been an effort
to keep the payments secret.
Or, Trump may have violated
campaign finance laws.
