ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED NOW

10
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,507
UNDER PRESSURE FROM DEMOCRATS

11
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:16,207
WOULD

00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:23,214
HE'S FIRED UP.

19
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,349
HE BELIEVES THE JUSTICE

20
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:25,850
DEPARTMENT'S PLAYING AROUND WITH

21
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,285
THESE DIFFERENT MEANINGS TO TRY

22
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:31,189

MAYBE DIFFERENT INFORMATION

26
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:35,059
WOULD BE DISCUSSED.

27
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:37,529
HE TOLD ME THE LAST MINUTE

28
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:38,296
CHANGE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

29
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:39,731
WAS "WEAK AND PATHETIC."

30
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,732
HE SAID YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON

31
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:41,032

32
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:42,700
HE ADDED "I WILL BE THERE AT

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,544
CAMPAIGN."

39
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:53,945
HE WANTS TO FIND THAT ONCE AND

40
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:54,946
FOR ALL.

41
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:57,549
HE ADDED "THIS IS WHY AMERICANS

42
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:58,249

43
00:00:58,249 --> 00:00:59,918

REPUBLICANS WILL GO BEHIND

57
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,308
CLOSED DOORS FOR A SIMILAR

58
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:23,741
BRIEFING.

59
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,110
AMID SIGNS OF THE PRESSURE FROM

60
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,045
THE PRESIDENT IN RECENT DAYS

61
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,347
SUCCEEDING IN TURNING THE TABLES

62
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:31,216
ON OBAMA OFFICIALS BECAUSE ALSO

63
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,485
KNEW TONIGHT, JAMES CLAPPER,

64
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:35,119
FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

65
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,621
INTELLIGENCE TELLING PBS THAT

66
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:38,189
THE INTENT WAS NOT TO SPY ON THE

67
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:38,723
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

68
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,291
BUT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

69
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:40,992
RUSSIANS WERE DOING.

70
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:45,830
A MILE APART FROM MARCH OF 2017

71
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,932
WHEN THE PRESIDENT CHARGED THAT

72
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:49,334
OBAMA OFFICIALS HAD CONDUCTED

73
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:49,767
SURVEILLANCE.

74
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:50,502
CLAPPER FALSELY CLAIMED IT WAS

75
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:51,736
NOT TRUE AT ALL.

76
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,137
THERE IS NO SURVEILLANCE.

77
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:54,839
NOW HE IS SAYING THE INTENT WAS

78
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,040
NOT TO SPY, LEAVING THE DOOR

79
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,043
OPENED ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

80
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:00,612
ALL OF THIS LEADING THE

81
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:01,312
PRESIDENT TO CALL CLAPPER A

82
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:02,413
LYING MACHINE AND HE ADDED TODAY

83
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,148
WAS A GOOD THING FOR THE COUNTRY

84
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:05,483
THAT IF OUR JAMES COMEY BECAUSE

85
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:08,887
OF WHAT HE CALLED THE FORMER FBI

86
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,323
CHIEF'S "LIES."

87
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:14,125
COMEY PUSHED BACK.

88
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,127
HE, LIKE CLAPPER, SEEMED TO

89
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:16,928
SHIFT HIS STORY.

90
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,130
COMEY ACKNOWLEDGING SOME KIND OF

91
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,466
SURVEILLANCE OCCURRED BUT

92
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,066
TREATING "FACTS MATTER.

93
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,168
THE FBI'S USE OF CONFIDENTIAL

94
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:25,169
HUMAN SOURCES IS TIGHTLY

95
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:25,803
REGULATED AND ESSENTIAL TO

96
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:27,739
PROTECTING THE COUNTRY.

97
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:28,540
ATTACKS ON THE FBI AND LYING

98
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,542
ABOUT ITS WORK WILL DO LASTING

99
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:31,342
DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY.

100
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:32,477
HOW WILL REPUBLICANS EXPLAIN

101
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:35,213
THIS TO THEIR GRANDCHILDREN?"

102
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:37,415
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PRESSURE

103
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:37,749
HERE.

104
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:39,951
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WANTS THE

105
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,718
TRUTH.

106
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:41,052
LISTEN.

107
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:41,719
>> President Trump: WE NOW

108
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,921
CALL IT SPYGATE.

109
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,289
YOU ARE CALLING IT SPYGATE.

110
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,757
A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAVE

111
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:46,124
HAPPENED.

112
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,892
I WANT THEM ALL TO GET TOGETHER.

113
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,327
THEY WILL SIT IN THE ROOM.

114
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:50,061
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

115
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,330
WORK IT OUT.

116
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,765
WE ARE NOT UNDERCUTTING.

117
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:54,465
WE'RE CLEANING EVERYTHING UP.

118
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:59,170
WHAT I WANT IS I WANT TOTAL

119
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,604
TRANSPARENCY.

120
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:00,672
>> NO ONE SHOULD TRUST ANYTHING

121
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,140
THEY SAY COMING OUT OF THAT

122
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,473
MEETING.

123
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,942
>> I DON'T CARE WHO COMES.

124
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:05,143
I'M NOT IN CONTROL OF THE INVITE

125
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:05,543
LIST.

126
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,011
THE ONLY THING I WOULD ASK IS

127
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:08,546
THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW UP,

128
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,548
SHOW UP WITH AN OPEN MIND AND

129
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:11,382
CLOSED LIPS.

130
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:15,119
>> CLOSED LIPS, SEEMS LIKE IT'S

131
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,522
A STRETCH THAT THERE WILL BE

132
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:18,656
CLOSED LIPS AND NO LEAKS.

133
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,726
OPEN MINDS, MAY BE AN EVEN

134
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:22,160
STEEPER CLIMB.

135
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,995
>> Shannon: JUST TO RECAP, BUT

136
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,965
BECAUSE NOT LONG AGO WE GOT THIS

137
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,132
INFORMATION.

138
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:29,601
THE INTEL BRIEFING THAT THEY ARE

139
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,502
PUSHING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT

140
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,071
THE SOURCE WHO WAS REPORTING

141
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:34,038
BACK TO THE FBI.

142
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:35,740
>> IN RESPONSE TO A SUBPOENA

143
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,240
FROM DEVIN NUNES.

144
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,709
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY HE

145
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:38,509
IS FIRED UP.

146
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,478
THIS IS A MEETING HE IS SUPPOSED

147
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:41,946
TO HAVE WITH SPEED 24 AND

148
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,114
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND FBI

149
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:44,949
OFFICIALS.

150
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,351
IT'S A SUBPOENA THAT NUNES

151
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:46,684
PUSHED.

152
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,752
>> Shannon: THAT MEETING IS

153
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:49,354
HAPPENING AT 12:00.

154
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,523
THEN WE HAVE A LIST HAPPENING AT

155
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:52,924
2:00.

156
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:55,727
THE SAME PLAYERS, INCLUDING THE

157
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:56,527
GANG OF EIGHT.

158
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,328
>> INCLUDING NUNES.

159
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:58,963
>> Shannon: HE IS NOT ON THE

160
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:00,264
LIST AT THE SECOND MEETING.

161
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:01,432
>> THAT IS KEY.

162
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:02,533
IT'S INTERESTING TO THE BECAUSE

163
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,534
LITERALLY I DIDN'T SEE THAT LIST

164
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,637
BECAUSE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH

165
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:06,437
NUNES AS IT WAS BEING PUT OUT.

166
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:07,639
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY

167
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,039
HE'S ANGRY.

168
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,908
YOU ARE RIGHT.

169
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,043
SOMEHOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

170
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,512
AND FBI SEEMS TO THINK THAT IF

171
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:15,513
THE SECOND MEETING, NUNES WILL

172
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:16,147
NOT ATTEND.

173
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:17,714
>> Shannon: HE IS PLANNING ON

174
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:18,016
GOING.

175
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:18,950
>> HE'S PLANNING ON GOING.

176
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,317
HE SAID I WILL SEE YOU AT

177
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:21,351
2:00 P.M. BECAUSE HE'S A MEMBER

178
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:22,153
OF THE GANG OF EIGHT.

179
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,555
HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE

180
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,958
INTEL, GANG OF EIGHT, INSIDER

181
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:27,425
WASHINGTON TERM.

THE HOUSE INTEL AND SENATE

184
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:32,930
INTEL.

185
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,933
BOTTOM LINE IS SEEMS LIKE THEY

186
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,135
WERE TRYING TO SAY NUNES IS

187
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:37,935
GOING TO GET ONE MEETING AND

188
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:38,636
THEN WE WILL TELL THE OTHER

189
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:42,340
LEADERS IN CONGRESS MAYBE

190
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,940
