the biggest mistake we made was not understanding right away early on that a ruler who was prepared to torture children and prepared to shoot unarmed people was going to stop at nothing and that if we did not draw a line and stick to it he would do he would destroy his country to stay in power that's exactly what he's done and we did not stop and we could have early on we could have once you use chemical weapons we could have taken a strike he concluded we would do nothing and he has destroyed his country and he's destabilized the region and we're going to deal with the ramifications of this for decades is there anything we can do now to better the situation we stopping the fighting at any point will help I mean at this point regardless what I think we should have done whatever right now i'll cut whatever deal i have to cut to get the fighting to end and that will help but but it will be to say fragile peace so it will be essentially kind of freezing everybody in place and it's going to take generations because you have you know ten millions of Syrians who are displaced who they're going to look at us and think oh yeah that's the countries that said Assad must go and did nothing
