1
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:14,705
>> Laura: I THOUGHT LEGALIZING

2
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:15,439
MARIJUANA WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,607
ORGANIZED CRIME OUT OF THE POT

4
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:17,074
BUSINESS.

5
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:19,677
NEWS FLASH, IT IS NOT.

6
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:22,646
A STARTLING REPORT FROM NBC NEWS

7
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:23,280
THIS MORNING REVEALS THAT

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,817
FOREIGN CARTELS EMBRACE

9
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:28,452
HOMEGROWN MARIJUANA AND

10
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:28,953
POT-LEGAL STATES.

11
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,654
THE REASON IS SIMPLE.

12
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:31,422
ACCORDING TO COLORADO

13
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:32,222
SHERIFF BILL ELDER THEY HAVE

14
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:33,857
FOUND THAT IT IS EASIER TO GROW

15
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:36,827
AND PROCESS MARIJUANA IN

16
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,662
COLORADO AND THEN SHIP IT

17
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:39,330
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,665
THAN IT IS TO BRING IT IN FROM

19
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:42,466
MEXICO OR CUBA.

20
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:46,804
FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY THE

21
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,839
CHINESE, CUBAN AND MEXICAN DRUG

22
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:49,974
RATES HAVE PURCHASED OR RENTED

23
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:54,178
HUNDREDS OF HOMES IN CALIFORNIA,

24
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,446
COLORADO AND WASHINGTON WHERE

25
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,014
LACKS POT LAWS PROVIDE COVER FOR

26
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:57,348
CARTEL.

27
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,049
IS IT TIME TO ADMIT THAT

28
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,051
LEGALIZED POT HAS FAILED?

29
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:03,487
HERE TO DEBATE THE QUESTION IS

30
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,254
MASON, A SPOKESMAN AT THE

31
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:06,457
MARIJUANA POLICY PROJECT.

32
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:07,458
JOINING US FROM DENVER.

33
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,293
MASON, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

34
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:10,461
THIS IS PRETTY WILD.

35
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:16,367
WE HAVE CHINESE, CUBAN, AND

36
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:20,971
MEXICAN MAFIA/CARTEL FOLKS

37
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,705
RENTING PROPERTIES IN COLORADO

38
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:24,041
AND CALIFORNIA.

39
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,042
TO GET THEIR PRODUCTS OUT.

40
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:26,977
HOW IS THIS GOOD FOR THE STATES

41
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:30,080
WERE POT WAS LEGALIZED?

42
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,814
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING

43
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:32,583
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN EVERY

44
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,652
STATE AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR

45
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,388
DECADES AND NOW IN STATES LIKE

46
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,857
COLORADO AND WASHINGTON AND

47
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:42,026
CALIFORNIA, WHAT WE ARE SEEING

48
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:42,860
IS THAT THE DEMAND AMONGST THE

49
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,795
POPULATION IN THOSE STATES IS

50
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:47,631
BEING MET BY A NEW LEGAL MARKET

51
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:49,466
WHERE THE PRODUCT IS BEING

52
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,601
CONTROLLED, IT'S BEING GROWN AND

53
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:52,736
SOLD BY LICENSED BUSINESSES AND

54
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:54,038
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL THAT

55
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:55,205
DEMAND IN THESE OTHER STATES

56
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:58,442
THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLING

57
00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:59,510
MARIJUANA, PEOPLE ARE STILL

58
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,943
PRODUCING IT.

59
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:01,678
>> Laura: COME ON.

60
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:03,881
MASON, THEY ARE ABLE TO UNDERCUT

61
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:05,282
THE EXPENSE -- I'VE BROWSED IN

62
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:08,852
SOME OF THOSE STORES IN

63
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:09,252
COLORADO.

64
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,888
INFUSED -- LAVENDER-INFUSED

65
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:11,221
EDIBLES.

66
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,856
THIS STUFF IS EXPENSIVE.

67
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:15,659
THE CARTELS CAN COME IN, RENT

68
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,161
THESE PLACES, UNDERCUT THE LEGAL

69
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,062
POT AND SOMETIMES A LOT MORE

70
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:19,163
POTENT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND A

71
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:20,898
LOT MORE DANGEROUS.

72
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:23,434
THEY FLOOD THE MARKET WITH THAT,

73
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,635
UNDERCUTTING LEGAL POT, NOT

74
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:26,170
CAUSING IT TO BE A PROBLEM.

75
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:26,870
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE

76
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,074
SHOPPING FOR MARIJUANA.

77
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,708
>> Laura: I'M NOT, THANK YOU

78
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,242
VERY MUCH.

79
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:33,844
I WAS SEEING WITH ALL THE

80
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:34,445
STONERS WERE BUYING.

81
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,512
>> THE FACT IS YOU CAN BUY

82
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:38,549
MARIJUANA FOR THE SAME OR LOWER

83
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,484
OF A RATE THEN YOU COULD ON THE

84
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:41,051
STREET.

85
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,020
NO ONE IS GOING OUT AND CALLING

86
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,655
AROUND TO ILLEGAL DRUG DEALERS

87
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:45,856
ARE TRYING TO GET IT ON THE

88
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:46,757
STREET CORNER.

89
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:47,458
IMAGINE IF ALCOHOL WAS BEING

90
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,293
SOLD ILLEGALLY.

91
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,161
>> Laura: I GET YOUR POINT.

92
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:51,795
LET'S HEAR WHAT COLORADO

93
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,697
LAW ENFORCEMENT -- ACTUALLY ON

94
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:55,466
THE FRONT LINES HERE, WHAT THEY

95
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,467
ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL

96
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,635
LEGALIZATION EXPERIMENT.

97
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:59,369
>> THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE

98
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,071
THAT WE COME ACROSS IN THESE

99
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:04,541
ROADS ARE CUBAN NATIONALS.

100
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,242
THEY ARE ORGANIZED DRUG

101
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:06,710
TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS WHO

102
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,479
COME TO COLORADO TO GROW THEIR

103
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,513
MARIJUANA.

104
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:11,081
>> COLOMBIA'S TO COCAINE AS

105
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,483
COLORADO IS TO MARIJUANA.

106
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,484
>> DO YOU THINK THE STATE IS

107
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,052
TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THAT?

108
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:16,253
>> I THINK THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY

109
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,388
TURNING A BLIND EYE.

110
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:19,957
>> THIS EXPERIMENT HAS FAILED

111
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:21,792
AND I URGE ANY STATE THAT IS

112
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,361
THINKING ABOUT LEGALIZING

113
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:25,395
MARIJUANA TO LEARN BY OUR

114
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:26,296
MISTAKES.

115
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:28,098
DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN IN OTHER

116
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:28,432
STATES.

117
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:29,133
>> Laura: FINAL THOUGHT FROM

118
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:33,570
YOU VERY QUICKLY?

119
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:35,606
CARTELS AND TRAINEES DRUG RINGS

120
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:40,043
ARE NOT RENTING OUT SUBURBS

121
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:42,112
HOUSES TO BOOTLEG IT AROUND THE

122
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:45,282
COUNTRY.

123
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,450
THAT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTS

124
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,251
LETTING STATES ESTABLISH THEIR

125
00:03:47,251 --> 00:00:00,000
OWN POLICIES AND IS WORKING WITH
