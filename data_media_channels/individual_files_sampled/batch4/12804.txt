the day obviously is that President Trump the Trump administration they have now moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem they they unveiled in this giant seals beautiful seal Ivanka Trump Jared Kushner they were both there they both spoke Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at this President Trump did not attend but he sent a message from abroad here's what it look like when President Trump paid homage to the new embassy in Jerusalem today we officially opened the United States Embassy in Jerusalem congratulations it's been a long time coming Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital yet for many years we fail to acknowledge the obvious the plain reality that Israel's capital is Jerusalem and we extend a hand in friendship to Israel the Palestinians and to all of their neighbors may there be peace may God bless this embassy may God bless all who served there and may God bless the United States of America okay Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister of Israel he also spoke and so it was very grateful obviously the president Trump for making this move again this had been approved by Congress as early as 1995 so for 23 years okay it has been the law of the land in the United States that they come that the embassy was supposed to move to Jerusalem Clinton chickened out George V bush chickened out Barack Obama chickened out Donald Trump did not and finally the embassy was in fact moved to Jerusalem which is just a recognition of simple facts the only reason anyone cares about Jerusalem or has ever cared about Jerusalem is because the Jews cared about Jerusalem first Hera's Benjamin Netanyahu Prime Minister of Israel talking about it we have no better friends in the world you stand for Israel and you stand for Jerusalem thank you what a glorious day remember this moment this is history President Trump by recognizing history you have made this street and that obviously is true look it's an emotional moment for anyone who is Jewish honestly like anyone who cares about Judaism anyone is Christian and cares about the New Testament anybody who cares about the history of Jerusalem this should be an emotional historic moment because the reality is that the fellow the fulfillment of Jewish control over Jerusalem was achieved in 1967 the fulfillment of the creation or recreation of a Jewish state in Israel is fulfilled in 1948 but the recognition by the United States that this is the reality puts to bed this idiotic myth that somehow Jerusalem was not Jewish okay there's an old tome utak story about a bunch of rabbis who in the aftermath of the destruction of the sent the second temple or two temples in the history of Judaism the first temple was destroyed in 587 BCE and then it was rebuilt just a few decades later and then the second temple was destroyed in 70 and has never been rebuilt that was destroyed in 70 CE II 70 AD there's a story from the Talmud about these rabbis who visited the site of the destruction of the temple all these are very very famous rabbis in Jewish law Rabban Gamliel rabbi Eleazar Ben Azaria rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiva and they there's a story about them going up to Jerusalem right after the destruction of the Second Temple and they reached Mount Scopus and they tore their garments when they reached the Temple Mount they saw a fox emerging from the place of the Holy of Holies the kodesh Kadosh him the the the place where they used to have the Ark of the Covenant and the other rabbis started lettuce started weeping and Rabbi Akiva started laughing this is from the Talmud and they said to him why are you laughing he said why are you weeping and they said they're more a place so holy that it is said to have the stranger that approaches it shall die and now foxes traverse it why shouldn't we weep and he said to them here's why I laugh for it is written I shall have bare witness for me faithful witnesses Uriah the priest and Zakaria the son of jariabek ayah now what is the connection between Uriah and Zachariah Jiraiya and Zakaria Uriah was at the time of the first temple Zechariah was at the time the second temple but the Torah makes Zacharias prophesy dependence on your ayahs prophecy with Uriah it's written therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed as a field with Zachariah tis written old men and women shall yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem as long as your ayahs prophecy has not been fulfilled I feared that Zechariah's prophecy may not be fulfilled either but now the Uriah's prophecy has been fulfilled it is certain that Zacharias you'll be fulfilled in other words there's a prophecy the temple would be destroyed he can't have the prophecy of the temple being rebuilt until the temple has been destroyed with these words they replied to makeva you have consoled the sake of consoled this one most famous stories in all of Tom utak lore because the center of Judaism has always been Jerusalem the center of judeo-christian tradition from where it's spring has always been Jerusalem according to the Bible the first mention of Jerusalem actually comes in Genesis 14 18 when Abraham meets the king of Shalem and then in Genesis 21 22 14 Abraham names the site of his near sacrifice of Isaac ara and that was at the same place you put those together Yahweh and shall aim is yerushalayim which means Jerusalem this is the site of David's Tower it's the site of Solomon's Temple it's the city of Hezekiah water tunnels have you never been to Israel never been in Jerusalem it's just an amazing experience you're walking the streets that existed for a thousand years before Jesus was walking the earth I mean it's amazing these are the streets that Jesus walked if you're a Christian and for a Jew these are the streets that were walked by they were tried by Solomon it's an unbelievable experience think of the oldest thing that you know of in the United States the oldest thing that you know of in the United States is probably from about 1620 okay now go back 2,600 years okay and you are talking about the stuff that you're finding in Israel Jerusalem was the eternal Jewish dream it is the eternal Jewish dream the dream of a free nation living in a land promised by God the same dream as we have in the United States is the dream of Israel is the dream of Bar Kochba who revolted against the Romans in 132 seee 60 years after the destruction of the Second Temple and actually used Roman coinage commenced his own he took Roman coins can buy these online it's really cool okay he actually took Roman coins and he beat the Roman coins to get rid of the logo on the Roman coins and then over it he put the logo of the Jewish temple with the words for the freedom of Jerusalem this is the dream of millions of Jews over thousands of years Jews pray thrice daily in 3 times a day we pray for the restoration of Jerusalem it was the dream of Mordechai Anielewicz who's the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising who wrote at the end of his life right before his murdered by the Nazis the dream of my life has risen to become fact Jewish armed resistance and revenge are facts I've been a witness to the Magnificent heroic fighting of Jewish men in battle hey I helped write the autobiography the memoirs of a Holocaust survivor this Holocaust survivor went through a fence he's actually lmv Saul's cousin he went through outfits and he went through raising Scott and after the war he went to Israel he actually had a visa to the United States he turned down the visa to the United States to go to Israel he walked off the boat they handed him a gun they sent him to the front lines of Latrun which was on the bloodiest battles in Israeli history and he helped establish the State of Israel doing behind the lines who work okay the fact that Israel even exists is a miracle the fact that Jerusalem is in Israeli hands is a miracle the fact that Jerusalem is an open city where you can worship as you choose is a miracle okay that's only because the Jews are in charge of Jerusalem president Trump's decision is not just a spiritually resonant one it's a wise one politically because there was never going to be a deal between Israel and its enemies until we recognized some basic facts on the ground Israel is not leaving Jerusalem the Jews are not leaving Jerusalem they never have they never will there's been continued continuous Jewish presence in Jerusalem literally since the inception of Jerusalem is a Jewish City in the book of Joshua the notion that there was ever a time when shoes did not live in Jerusalem or when it was important for reasons that were non-jewish to begin is idiotic hey Islam only built the Dome of the rock on the Temple Mount specifically for the same reason that they build mosques on top of other holy sites they knew it was a Jewish holy site they built a dome on top of it doesn't mean the dome should be destroyed obviously but it does mean that to pretend that Islam somehow predated Judaism in this area is historically ignorant and ridiculous Judaism obviously is the foundation stone for Christianity as well anyone who loves history anyone who loves the judeo-christian heritage of the West has to understand the importance of recognizing that heritage and that begins with the word on the stones of Jerusalem okay history exists and truth exists okay when when Jews sat and mourned and they said if I forget Jerusalem may I forget my right hand my right hand forget its cunning hey there you didn't they meant it they meant it you've never been to Jerusalem honestly everybody should take a trip to Jerusalem it's an amazing thing hey Jerusalem has not been forgotten and it will not be forgotten the Jews that were nearly wiped off the planet are now in control of the holiest site in Judaism the tears have indeed turned to laughter in the Talmud it says eternity refers to Jerusalem Jerusalem is eternal the God who made it is eternal as well and good for President Trump from recognizing a basic human truth good for President Trump from recognizing the fact that the Jews belong in Jerusalem and Jerusalem belongs to the Jews to pretend that anything else is historically ignorant now the press are historically not only are they historically ignorant it's hard not to call the press anti-semitic in the way that they cover these these stories so at the same time they're initiating the movement of the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Hamas has initiated all of these riots all this violence on the border of Gaza now Gaza is in complete control chaos hey Gaza is run by Palestinians it is not run by the Israelis Israel has nothing to say except for border control about what happens in the Gaza Strip it is a hellhole it is a hellhole because Hamas is a terrorist group that cares a lot more about murdering Jews than it does about making the lives of its own citizens better if there if anyone wanted peace in the Palestinian Authority or Hamas it would happen immediately if they just said listen we are now done with all the violence we're finished now we're going to build up our society let's open it up everything would be open tomorrow that's not what's happening if you've seen the headlines today a lot of the headlines from the press are all about you know 41 Palestinians killed in clashes with Israel okay Israel is not clashing with the Palestinians what is happening is the camasta is delegating they are sending a bunch of terrorists to the border in an attempt to breach the border it's pretty amazing I'll probably show the proof of the two in just one second and and I'll talk about some of the media coverage which is just egregious of this of the embassy move it's it's astonishing how bad the media coverage is and demonstrates where their heads are at but first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over a texture so if you're listening to this podcast you are addicted to

onto the media coverage about the situation in Jerusalem so quickly before I talk about the media coverage in Jerusalem there's a headline from the New York Times The New York Times is egregiously anti-israel they've been egregiously anti-israel as long as I have been alive and probably longer and there's an amazing headline it says from David helm held finger pain he writes Israel feels pride but senses peril as u.s. moves embassy and the and they're talking about how it's it's really it's really dangerous time for Israel and people are really nervous about Israel ok here's what it actually looks like in Israel okay I need to show you this tape of what it looks like in Israel right now I'm Malkin al-huda this is clip 9 yeah clearly people there are very torn about the situation in Israel on the 70th anniversary of its independence again literally literally thousands of people cheering in the streets of maconnais who - Makani Judah is the biggest market place in Jerusalem it's the street that is completely filled and look that is so typical of Israel right you see Orthodox Jews and then if you see in the background there you see an Israeli flag mixed with a gay flag ok Israel is a pretty diverse place pretty amazing diverse place if you haven't visited you really should I keep saying that but it really is true I was married there my wife this Israeli her family is Israel last time we were there actually is about 10 years ago what we're gonna have to go trip I think I think we're gonna have to take a trip to Israel bring some my listeners along so I think that would be just a blast but the coverage of the situation in the Gaza Strip is totally incredible and totally biased against Israel so here is the headline from The Washington Post headline from The Washington Post Israelis killed dozens of Palestinians in Gaza protesting u.s. embassy moved to Jerusalem well if you just read that headline you might assume that Israelis are killing protesters about the u.s. embassy that people are just protesting in the streets they're a little upset and Israel's going out there and slaughtering them out on us that is not what is happening what is happening is Hamas sent 40,000 people to the border with Israel they're attempting to walk across the border they're sending kites that are on fire across the border an attempt to start brush fires in Israel they're throwing Molotov cocktails and soldiers that are throwing rocks at soldiers they're hiding behind women and children's who do so this is what camasta is because they are a terrorist group so that Washington Post story is headline Israelis kill dozens of Palestinians in Gaza protesting u.s. embassy moved to Jerusalem this is in the article itself well some said they would abide by official calls to keep the demonstrations peaceful others talked about their enthusiasm to break into Israel and wreak havoc we are excited to stormy get inside said 23 year old Mohammed mansoura when asked what he would do inside Israel he said whatever is possible to kill throw stones does that sound a lot like a bunch of peaceful protesters at the border no it doesn't because they aren't a bunch of peaceful protesters at the border it's a bunch of people trying to invade Israel and Israel is repelling that and by the way I have the evidence that Israel isn't wholesale slaughtering people the evidence is that Israel has complete ground and air superiority if they wanted a wholesale slaughter forty thousand people they would they've got like 40 people who are attacking the border hey more headlines from the Gaza Strip in just one second so here they are ok so this is from The Jerusalem Post some 35,000 Palestinians were reported by the IDF as taking part in violent protests at 12 different locations along the fence throwing stones explosive devices and Molotov cocktails at the fence and IDF troops burning tires and other burning objects with the intention of setting fires in Israeli territory by the way the burning of the tires is creating enormous environmental havoc in the Gaza Strip itself a bunch of Palestinians are sick because of all of this The Jerusalem Post witnessed at least six incendiary kites with two setting fires two fields near a kibbutz and a hollows so really in really using the power of inventiveness are the Palestinians under the control of Hamas sending kites laden with fire over the border you know could invent stuff or you could set a kite on fire and try to kill some Jews the idea afforded an attempted terror attack on Monday when three armed Palestinians laid an explosive device near Rafah on the Gaza Israel border the IDF spokesman brigadier general Ronan matalas he said in an interview to army radio quote Hamas is paying family to go to the fence protest with Iranian money we have intelligence the Kumasi operatives plans use the protests to harm and even abduct soldiers they're trying to kidnap Israeli soldiers the whole point of this obviously is to draw attention away from the situation with the embassy and to provide exactly the sort of media coverage you saw all day today with the split screens of Israelis celebrating and Palestinians suffering oh it's so rough for the Palestinians it is rough for the Palestinians because they keep in terrorist groups when you keep electing the Palestinian Authority and Islamic Jihad and Hamas to positions of power it turns out you're gonna live in a hellhole when you keep allowing your government to delegate terrorists to the border it turns out that the people on the other side of that border may not be too happy with you but again the way the media cover this as though it is it is totally Israel's fault another element of this okay so there was a lot of talk yesterday about clashes on the Temple Mount on Jerusalem day so Jerusalem day is the day when Israel liberated Jerusalem from the rule of the turanians it was in fact a liberation it was a liberation because suddenly all these sites were open to Jews and Christians and Muslims alike gave the Temple Mount however it was handed over to the controlled these lana quacks so that evil horrible israeli government you know the Islamophobic israeli government handed over controlled the holiest site in the history of judaism to the muslims hey does not jews who are control of the day-to-day on top of the islamic on top of the Temple Mount instead they handed it over to the control of the Islamic walk which prevents Jews like me from going up on the Temple Mount and praying yeah I'm literally barred if I were to go to Israel tomorrow and if I were to walk up on the Temple Mount I am barred from praying if I took out a sitter I can do it anywhere else in the world literally anywhere else on the planet except for Islamic countries which would punish me for being Jewish anywhere in America I could pull out a psalm book okay it's what it's handle and book is and I would just pull it out and start praying if I did that on the Temple Mount I will be arrested and it's exactly what happened yesterday okay according to eyewitnesses this is why net Jews entered the holy site and they were singing the Arabs were calling out Allahu Akbar police forces that arrived at the scene had to separate the warring sides and move the Jews from the Temple Mount I'm sorry it's not a warring side for Jews to go up in the holiest site in Judaism and say thank you to God but this is illegal in Israel here the Jerusalem police said several Jewish visitors broke the rules of conduct and created provocation hey this is how sensitive Israel is the concerns of the Islamic population living in Israel they're so sensitive to those concerns that Jews are not allowed to pray on the Temple Mount for fear of provoking Muslims okay this is actual antia and like honestly if this were proposed this were done in Saudi Arabia you'd call it anti-semitic policy the idea that Jews are not allowed to pray on a historically Jewish surface because it might tick off Muslims but this has been the record of Muslims in the region radical Muslims in the region for this is why when everyone tries to drop moral equivalence between what Israel is doing in in Jerusalem and what Israel is doing in Israel and what Hamas is doing in the Gaza Strip or what the Palestinian Authority are doing well even the Islamic walk is doing it's just insane it's just insane and ridiculous but again none of this is is designed to be objective media coverage all of it is designed to pretend that Israel is the aggressor in a conflict in which Israel is clearly not the aggressor Israel is clearly clearly not the aggressor in this conflict it never was the aggressor Israel accepted the deal in 1947 from the UN it was attacked by Arab states Israel in 1956 was blockaded from the Suez Canal and they and they won that war - in 1967 there was a pre-emptive attack that was launched by Israel as all of its borders were were were about to be attacked by Islamic countries in 1973 there was an attack on Yom Kippur the the most holy day in Judaism and it very came very near to wiping out the State of Israel in 1982 Lebanon was using Hezbollah in order to in order to strike at Israel Israel has constantly been a defensive war since its inception and the media keep covering as though Israel is the aggressor in the same way they cover America as though America is the aggressor which shows that the leftism of the American media and the international media expands to a hatred for the State of Israel they hate the State of Israel because Israel is an outpost of the West they don't hate the West because of the West backs Israel okay meanwhile yesterday was was Mother's Day to switch topics and I couldn't help

yesterday it was Mother's Day and Mother's Day is always a weird time if you're on the left I have to imagine it's kind of a weird time if you're on the left because the left likes to proclaim that they love Mother's Day oh I'm gonna go out for mimosas with mom for brunch for Mother's Day here's one of the things that's weird about leftist patterns of thought so a lot of folks on the left they'd like to proclaim that certain things in America are sacrosanct Parenthood children apple-pie mothers but then when it comes to their actual ideology they're kind of anti a lot of those things when it comes to mothers for example mothers are seen as Stooges of the patriarchy by a lot of radical feminists if you are a woman and you choose to stay home and mother your children this makes you a bad person you are a lesser person you've been sucked into the maw of the patriarchy that is chewed you up and spit you out and suggested that you must indeed be a woman barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen rather than running companies rather than having a job okay if you're a stay-at-home mom you're a bad person according to a lot of folks on the left but then when it comes Mother's Day Mother's Day I love Mother's Day you can't have it both ways if you think mothers are rubes and you can't you can't celebrate Mother's Day plus you got a bunch of folks on the left and I would say the majority of the left now that suggests that a child doesn't need a mother now I believe a child doesn't your mother a child needs a mother and a father and this is why I always tweet out on Mother's Day happy parent Apple a happy legal guardian unspecified gender day because if you are on the left this is what you believe you believe that you can have a legal guardian of any gender whatsoever you can have a mother who's a father a father who's a mother a mother who used to be a father a father who used to be a mother who used to be a chicken any of these things are possible so why not just call it legal guardian specified gender day but no but then the left gets mad when you say this because it shows that they're really not super Pro mom is a general rule you know the whole were in favor of abortion and we think that women are stupid if they stay home with their kids and also a child doesn't need a mother a child brought up by wolves or any other family arrangement is totally fine Mowgli had it best you know all of this and then they say we love Mother's Day hey you can't again you can't have it both ways you can't say that you hold certain things sacrosanct when you clearly do not hold them sacrosanct the same thing is true of the innocence of children the same people who will say you have to protect innocent children from video games you have to protect innocent children from the predations of their church-going parents these are the same people who say then a four-year-old should be seeing a psychiatrist to get hormone treatment to prevent puberty and these are the same folks okay so anyway I tweeted some of this stuff out yesterday and a lot of people on the Left have very very mad okay a lot of people say yeah how could I just room Mother's Day by pointing out that a lot of folks on the Left don't really have a reason to celebrate Mother's Day hey and then I did something even worse yesterday I did something even worse on Mother's Day so I asked my this is actually a funny story so yesterday morning I woke up and my daughter woke me up I went in there to her room gave her a big hug and she said what day is it today I said well Sunday and it's Mother's Day we're gonna do some special stuff for mommy isn't that fun and she said yeah and then I said sweetheart you're gonna when you grow up you can't you're gonna have a job and you're also gonna be a mommy which one of those things do you think is probably gonna be more fun and she said being a mommy so I can cuddle my babies which is really cute right clearly she's a victim of the patriarchy because if she knew best she would know that working a long 2,200 billable hours a year job as an associate of Law Firm is significantly more fun than cuddling baby's clearly she would know this by the way I would assume that if I asked my son this when he's old enough not to be pooping in his diapers if I asked him this I assume he'll give me the same answer cuz being a dad is super fun we need more parents male and female who are interested in raising their children rather than making their career first priority that would be great you know my career is very very important to me I think that every day I get up and I'm eager to go to work but I'm even more eager to spend time with my kids I probably spend more time with my kids at this point that my wife does because she's in medical residency as as I may have mentioned once or twice she's a doctor so anyway I tweeted this out I tweeted out I asked my four-year-old this morning whether she thought it'd be more fun to have a job or be a mommy she said to be a mommy so I can cuddle my babies clearly she has already been victimized by the patriarchy and I said I would begin teaching her in order to counter man the demands of the patriarchy I'd begin teaching her the babies are made out of thorns and hatred and that she can work as an executive at Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and that will somehow make it all better a bunch of people have got really mad number one they misinterpreted the tweet to assume that what I was saying is that she could either have a job or be a mommy witch yes that's me all over right I'm the guy who says women can't have jobs except for how my mom worked in my dad stayed at home and my wife works and I stay at home except for all of that you got me spot on spot on I'm the guy who forces my wife to be a doctor yes clearly you've pegged me correctly leftists and people on the Left got very angry though because if you point out a very simple truth hey that little girls want to be mommies they get so mad they get so angry if you say little girls naturally want to be mommies and have babies of their own no no that is a gender construct that is something that you had to teach them never mind hundreds of thousands of years of human biology never mind all an animal kingdom biology don't mind any of that stuff it was clearly that five guys got in a room several thousand years ago and they said we have to convince women it's good to have babies we have to convince them of this now we should also never mind all the fact that all these all these feminist women hit the age of 40 and they start freezing their eggs because they're afraid they're not gonna be able to have kids we should not be a we should we should ignore the fact that a lot of women turn around at age 35 after having being told that they could have everything the career and the and the children and think man I wish that I had spent a little more time at home we should ignore all of those things instead we should we should pretend that all of this is is a construct that is unnatural for women to want babies girls want babies little girls want to have babies and when my daughter plays games my daughter's games she was doing it last night there's a giant Barney that we have in our house a giant Barney doll that we have in our house my daughter made a bed for her giant Barney and then she said my giant Barney is sick and I want to take care of my giant Barbie Barney because he is my baby my son takes a bat and hits the giant Barney okay there are different children because boys are not the same as girls so stupid but if you acknowledge this then it's somehow bad but here's the problem if you don't acknowledge this and why you're celebrating Mother's Day if you're not pretending that it's innate to women to want to be mothers if you're not per se if you're not suggesting that women have something special to offer in the realm of parenthood then why are we celebrating Mother's Day in the first place I love it so Elizabeth spires who's a feminist idiot she tweeted out the fact that you framed it to her as an either/or is the problem Ben and and I tweeted back well I didn't frame it as an either/or I say I said which one is more fun okay if I said when you grow up which do you think will be more fun going to a baseball game or going to work I'm not suggesting that you can only go to baseball games and never go to work I'm suggesting that there's a hierarchy of fun and it actually is an important question so here's the here's the punchline so it's really funny I told my wife about this yesterday we were in the car and we're driving to Disneyland with the kids and I turned to my wife and I told her this story and she says oh that's really funny because you know what I asked my daughter I asked I asked my our daughter the same question last night it's I asked her I don't you know there's my wife again the doctor who turned to my daughter last night and she said okay this is it this is a closed paraphrase and she said you know mommy loves being a doctor but mommy loves being your mommy even more than that a lot more than that if mommy mommy wants to spend more time with you okay is she part of the patriarchy now my wife this is so stupid okay all of this is so dumb but the same lepton wants to obliterate gender differences and then celebrate gender differences you can't do both obliterate them or celebrate them you can't obliterate them and then celebrate them you can't pretend men and women are exactly the same with exactly the same aspirations hopes and dreams and then say that women are unique creatures who deserve special days like Mother's Day all of this is just yeah and I love this so dictionary.com actually tweeted out at me fallacy any of the various types of erroneous reason that render arguments logically unsound Thank You dictionary.com I'm so glad that you define fallacy for me in turn at dictionary.com whose life's work is to tweet out definitions written by others hundreds of years ago you dolt hey I did not say that my daughter should not get a job I've told her by the way that she could be President of the United States and you know what she you know what she responded she said that sounds really boring can't argue can't argue with that okay so I want to talk a little bit about this this whole McCain apology

we're the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation okay so meanwhile there's a big hubbub that has arisen over John McCain so John McCain is unfortunately extremely sick and he is likely to pass away sometime in the next few months he has brain cancer and it's it's really sad whatever you think of John McCain John McCain is is I think I mean there's no question he's an American patriot I'm the man suffered horrific torture and then served for decades in the Senate trying to do what he thought was was right I disagree with him a lot of politics everything from campaign finance reform Medicaid Part D I agree I disagree with him on many many policies I thought that his 2008 run for the presidency was lackluster none of that has to do with who he is as a patriot and his contributions to the country okay so there is a big story that broke late last week bad for the Trump administration there's a woman named named Sadler who apparently in some meeting her name is Kelly Sadler and she apparently in a meeting at the White House was asked about the fact that McCain was going to vote against Gina Haspel Gina Haspel is of course Donald Trump's nominee for CIA to head the CIA and apparently during the meeting she joked that somebody was gonna that that who cares he's gonna die anyway right and then this leaked so there are two issues here okay issue here number one is what she said and issue number two is leaked so what she said is obviously horrible right it's a horrible joke clearly and that raised some questions about the people in the room because we've all been in meetings where somebody's making horrible jokes but we all know where the lines are right so we have meetings here at this office where people are making dumb horrible jokes but the certain jokes that you won't make even among your friends because they're just too egregious and just too yucky this is a joke that you wouldn't make among your friends okay well you know John McCain is gonna die soon it's just yeah you you don't make a joke about a dying man particularly not a patriot and and so obviously that's that's pretty terrible and it says something about the people in the room that this sort of went unnoticed or unremarked upon and apparently no one tried at her or that she felt comfortable enough to say it in the first place suggests that maybe people at the White House say some stuff that they shouldn't be saying on a pretty regular basis but that's not a shock I mean Donald Trump said in the middle of the campaign and then John McCain was not a war hero because he'd been captured so it says something about the the moral fish rotting from the head when it comes to bad the same bad stuff about others and then there's the question liek so people on the right who have been pointing out that it is not good that the administration leaks this much they've been they've been shellacked over the weekend how why are you so worried about who'll eats the Sadler conversation why aren't you more worried about what she said well I can be worried about both I can talk about the moral lack in saying that John McCain's gonna die soon but I can also worry about the fact that there's a White House so leaky but the way that you take down your political opponents who supposedly are working for the same goals that you are is to leak the nasty stuff that they said in a conversation there's a certain level of trust that has to exist in any office environment you know this you work in an office I work in an office there's a certain level of trust and the truth is that people make what would widely be construed as inappropriate jokes all the time now this may be beyond the pale inappropriate but how many inappropriate jokes do we make a day here at the daily office a thousand I mean a lot of inappropriate jokes I'm not talking racist jokes or anything but I'm talking about jokes that if you printed them in the pages within the New York Times people go oh that's weird why would they make that joke okay that sort of stuff happens all the time at offices all around the country and it would be kind of bad for your business if it turned out that every time somebody made a joke that would read a lot worse than it would speak then that would sort of make the front pages of New York something bad for your business and that John Mulaney has a comedy special where he talks specifically about this where apparently one of his friends and was it one of his friends was in trouble with with the law because somebody had was testifying against them in a civil case and John Mulaney wrote a funny email back that said something like that something want me to kill them for you that's a joke and then he's jokes about the fact that if that had been read in court that would be a real problem for him right because suddenly we'd be read in court at the John Mulaney wanted to kill somebody that sort of stuff happens at your business every day I think this falls under that category meaning it's something bad that was said but now it's being turned into a national issue now obviously the proper solution to this is for Kelly salvo to come out and say I shouldn't have said it obviously it was it was a poor joke I never should have said anything like this instead it's instead because the White House has a habit of never backing down never apologizing she continues not to apologize publicly for this even though she called up Megan McCain that apologized privately Bernie Sanders was asking why the White House won't apologize to McCain I do have a theory and shake it is beyond my comprehension it is one thing in the white house for somebody to say something crude and stupid and disrespectful an American Hero it is another thing for them not to apologize so it is beyond my comprehension I just don't know what goes on in that White House mentality for there not being an apology for that terrible remark okay so Bernie Sanders he says that the people in the White House should obviously apologize the reason that the people in the white house aren't apologizing is because they have a basic rule never compromise never apologize never apologize because they're just going to bang you over the head about it now I don't think that rule is actually true I don't think it's true that if you just came forward you said yep never should have said it you take flak for about a day and then it would be done but I understand the tendency on the part of some people in the White House that tendency to say listen I'm not going to bend over backwards in order to apologize to people who are just going to shellac me for it anyway we're just gonna crush me for it anyway I know that's Donald Trump's tendency and he's been very successful with it in this particular case it seems to me the sadler should just come forward and apologize that said I think anybody who is found to have leaked this stuff to the press should be fired if I were a head of the Trump administration I'd be firing nearly everybody in that room because you can't have a working business environment which people are leaking like this I mean while there's something weird that's beginning to happen in comedy land so a lot of the comedian's are beginning to realize that maybe the making fun of Trump thing is actually kind of counterproductive which it is it's so funny the left dominance of the cultural Heights their dominance in the world of comedy their dominance in the world of entertainment media it's made them think they're a lot more powerful than they actually are it's why at the DNC some people like Lena Dunham up there on stage the Lena Dunham was going to swing votes of anybody who wasn't already living in big cities and and watching girls they really think that their dominance of the cultural Heights means dominance of the political heights but what you've actually seen is that Republicans in many ways are dominant to an extraordinary degree in politics and Democrats are extraordinarily dominant at the degree of culture and this is not a coincidence I think the dominance of Democrats in culture is driving the Republican dominance in politics the fact that so many people around the country feel constantly derided and insulted by the media it makes them feel like fine I'll just vote Republican fine you're gonna label me a jerk I'm just gonna go vote how you don't want me to vote anyway because I don't like you either there's a lot of that going around and it seems to like a lot of the comedians are starting to figure this out so Jimmy Kimmel Pope Jimmy he has decided that America might be tired in fact of the bashing of Donald Trump that maybe this has been a maybe this has been a mistake so he did an interview he did an interview with with the upfront and he said sometimes there's such low-hanging fruit you have to choose between 12 jokes on one subject and picking the right ones is something I obsess over then I found two that almost inevitably my best jokes come to me around 3:00 in the morning when I'm sitting there alone but then he admitted that perhaps they have gone a little bit too far and he says he says I hadn't really thought about it that way but I guess you're right hopefully it'll be the last up front of the Trump era - so I don't know how much focus will be on there I think people have had an ass full of Donald Trump and I feel like the up front is the time to look within and make fun of ourselves he says that he can't imagine the up fronts are gonna be completely Trump free but he's planning on not making it his focus he's saying that he might actually be moving beyond beyond a lot of the of the Trump stuff because people are just tired of the Donald Trump stuff well the reason people are tired of the Trump stuff is because you weren't even handed about it during the Obama era it is amazing that so many of these comedians seem to ignore the fact that Obama was an inherently funny human being as well because he was so pretentious Donald Trump is an inherently funny being because Donald Trump is Donald Trump but a lot of people are beginning to recognize this is a mistake Saturday Night Live they're recognizing now that political stuff is beginning to get a little bit old do you like the show right look I do remember I was in that production of The Crucible in high school right yeah you know the principal is a lot like witch-hunt against President Chuck okay don't look that let's go enough with the Trump jokes mom I don't write those and why doesn't us now ever talk about crooked Hillary mom I'm so new here please do not do this to me okay and this is exactly right okay SNL may begin maybe maybe the comedians are beginning to get it would you actually be bad news for Republicans as the Republican yes it's irritating to watch Michelle what's-her-face go off at the at the White House Correspondents Dinner on Sarah Huckabee Sanders yes watching her make abortion jokes is going but as a conservative yes you need more of this right you need is more of these comedians being idiots well you need is more of the comedians who are wildly biased because it's driving people into the Republican camp well good news there still Trump Renault so Trevor Noah can't be central he says the president Trump is like an African dictator he is just like an African dictator is just like Mugabe right because he's seizing a lot of people's money and because he's redistributing land and probably because he's killing all of his enemies wait how's he like an African dictator again Trevor not explained I said from the very beginning that Donald Trump reminds me of an African dictator and if you know anything about African dictators the first thing you have to do is follow the money and you follow the money with the people closest to them family members business associates all you do is watch for the money and I would have been disappointed had we not found out or had Michael Cohen not done this I'm like yeah this is following the script this is what you were meant to be doing as the person who roles with Donald Trump you were always going to be finding a way to swindle cash one of the things that's extraordinarily going about this of course is that this is Trevor Noah on CNN with brian Stelter one of the things a lot of these comic figures like to do is play the clown nose on clown nose off routine so the minute they say something controversial to go hey I'm just a comedian I can say whatever I want why are you taking me seriously hey I'm a comic and then Jimmy Kimmel will go out there with his sick child and talk about his sick child and use the sick child as an excuse for revamping health care or Trevor Noah will go on CNN and give his political tank listen you want to be both that's fine you're gonna get treated like a pundit and that means that we're going to critique you like a pundit this is idiotic every politician in American history of any prominence or amend most of them I would say have had family connections with serious corruption involved just ask bills siblings just ask Hillary Clinton ask Hugh Rodham ask the Kennedys and all of the the the idea that Donald Trump is like an African dictator is such a wild exaggeration wild stupidity no wonder people are not taking some folks on the Left seriously when they look at it folks like Trevor Noah or Jimmy Kimmel as political lights to follow okay time for some things I like things I hate then we'll do a Federalist paper real fast so things I like since it is in fact a celebrity day for Jerusalem I'm gonna play you the most beautiful song ever written about Jerusalem this is a song called yerushalaim shel zahav so it's in Hebrew it's called Jerusalem Jerusalem is made of gold Jerusalem of Gold is the literal translation and the singer on this I'm trying member her name it's Oprah huzzah huzzah yeah Oprah huzzah she was in I'm her voice and Prince of Egypt she sings the she sings one of the parts in Prince of Egypt there's an old tape a really tragic story I think she died of like hepatitis when she's like 42 through a blood transfusion it's really terrible but she but but this rendition a beautiful I'm shel zahav is quite beautiful I use it very often when I'm cause on at my shul so at my at my synagogue I sometimes pray for the congregation when I do that is a song that I like to use the tune of for from the various prayers so here is here's the song just a beautiful song Yamaha Oh mission so it's a beautiful song that the lyrics mean the mountain air is clear as water the sense of pines around is carried on the breeze of Twilight and tinkling bells resound the trees and stones their softly slumbers a dream unfolds them all so solitary lies the city and at its heart a wall o Jerusalem of gold and of light and of bronze I am the loot for all your songs it's a beautiful beautiful song and she's actually a terrific singer Oh for a huzzah so you should check out her work on mine as well okay time for some quick things that I hate so Hillary Clinton is a mad at everybody again I'm just gonna go around the rest of her life being angry which I think might not actually be that much of a change for it seems like she spent most of her life being angry at something or other now she's still angry at the American public and saying that they are sexist she says there's still a very large portion of the population that is uneasy with women in positions of leadership and so the easiest way to kind of avoid having to look at someone on her merits is dismiss her on her looks yes I'm sure that's why you lost it's not because you're deeply off-putting on every conceivable level it's because people don't like the way that you look if you're a beautiful woman I'm sure you would have won Hillary Clinton except for the fact that no and there's this amazing study who's really funny where they took the debate between the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton and they reversed the sexist they had a guy read all of Hillary Clinton's lines and a woman read all Donald Trump's lines and then they had people evaluate the debate they people who are they're sitting there with with the dials trying to determine who won and turns out that Trump as a woman won by more of a margin than Trump is a man because Hillary's personality is so off-putting that it doesn't matter whether she's a man or a woman she's just that amount of off-putting which is pretty amazing okay other things that I hate so Benedict Cumberbatch has now said that he's gonna turn down a role unless his unless his co-star is paid the same amount of money that he is that's because internet feminists were very angry that Bryce Dallas Howard was paid two million dollars less then Chris Pratt was for the new Jurassic Park movie of course she was paid less because no one cares of price tell us how it is in those movies it sure just if you were to disappear tomorrow and suddenly be replaced by by Jessica Chastain like just another redhead then no one would care right would even like if that happened when people even notice really not the Bryce Dallas Howard isn't a good actress but she doesn't do anything in those movies she's not the start of the film was Chris Pratt is the star of the films I'm happy to pay Bryce Dallas Howard like a great acting job but she is not the draw of those movies benedict cumberbatch however he's now trying to say that equal pay and a place at the table out of the central tenets of feminism look at your quotas ask what women are being paid and say if she's not paid the same as men I'm not doing it and he says that he has a new production company that is female focused now I don't hate this because he is because he's doing this good for him that's fine you know but what I do hate is the implication that any man who's not doing this is somehow shortchanging women that's ridiculous hey Benedict Cumberbatch is gonna have to take less pay to do this end of story if he actually and because no one is gonna pay he look he's the star of Doctor Strange I mean no one is going to pay whatever random female co-star of the next Doctor Strange movie is the same amount they're gonna pay Benedict Cumberbatch not unless Benedict Cumberbatch takes less pay because the reality is that if he asks for five million dollars and I can't pay some some female lead who's gonna be in them one movie the same amount I think there is a market to this stuff Jennifer Lawrence makes a lot of money women in film make a lot of money I do love the people the upper end of the income bracket complaining about income inequality it's pretty amazing so if you wants to take a pay cut good for him that's it that's well within his rights they did that on friends by the way that all the people who are the stars and friends they want to pay some more and others less and they got together and I believe they pooled their income and said okay we're all gonna be paid the same amount of money that's cool good for Benedict Cumberbatch on that level but again if the implication is the Chris Pratt is doing something deeply horribly wrong by taking more money than the Bryce Dallas Howard may be sure how to get a better agent or maybe sure to pick better script okay time for the time from Federalist paper real fast so Federalist number 28 every week we go through a federalist paper where all the way up to Federalist number 28 Alexander Hamilton writes this one he wrote the vast majority of them he continues with his arguments about the strength of the national government with an army under the control of the legislature so there's a lot of debate over who should actually control the the national army should there be a standing army a lot of people very afraid of this because they thought that it would suck power away from the state and he makes one very interesting argument he says if the representatives of the people betrayed their constituents the argument here is that we can't have the legislature control the National standing army because if we do then this will allow the legislature to run roughshod over the state so how Alexander Hamilton writes if the representatives of the people betray their constituents there's then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state he's talking about the right to resist okay so for all the people out there on the Left who say that there was no inherent right to resist there's no right to bear arms keeping bear arms for use against the government Alexander Hamilton is explicitly talking about that he's talking about if the legislature were to usurp the powers of the people the people would stand up and the reason you want a national standing army as opposed to state standing armies is because it is actually harder to fight against a state standing army than it is to have the state to act as the go-between for a battle against the national government in reality that's exactly what happened during the Civil War it's a lot bloodier because whose national national government versus the States but the argument here is even deeper than that and that is that you do have a natural right to resist a government that usurped your fundamental rights and if the government does usurp your fundamental rights that's the reason that you need to keep in bear arms as a root as a root cause okay so
