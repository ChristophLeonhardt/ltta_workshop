My sisters and I were all on
the front porch watching this
green tank coming down
the street with the barrel up,
hitting the leaves and we were,
like, in awe with disbelief.
We heard gunshots,
we heard sirens, police,
cars running down the street.
We would see people running up and
down the street with TVs on their backs.
The riots started all the exodus
of white people, families, elderly blacks,
because everybody started moving out.
And this neighborhood was
the most beautiful neighborhood
I have ever seen in my life.
Everybody took care of their property.
It was so nice. We had 
the Drome bowling alley.
We had a furniture store, record stores.
We had a cleaners.
It will never be like I remembered it.
It will never be that again.
They say that it's coming back,
but I don't see it.
