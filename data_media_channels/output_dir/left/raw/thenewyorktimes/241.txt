1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,150
“I could do this all day.
Like, give me a Sharpie

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,070
and, like, it’s on.
Oh, nice.”

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,429
“I like signing my name.

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:12,280
I don’t know, I feel 
like the J is sexy

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,740
because you could do 
so many things with it,

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,910
and so many curves to it,
which I think fits me.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,852
It’s funny because I feel like
we don’t sign at all anymore.”

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,990
“I used to love to sign my name.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,570
Be all over a notebook at the 
end of like a school year.”

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,610
“That was in middle
school, when I was

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,570
very excited about trying to
figure out how to do a signature.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,920
Then in high school,

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,890
I created another signature.

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,280
You know, 16 years old,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,930
got my driver’s license.”

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,130
“So when I was, I guess
in grade school,

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,540
I remember trying to make a
signature that I thought looked

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,550
kind of like graffiti or a tag.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,590
Even though I had never, 
you know, spray-painted

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,940
or done anything like that.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,450
I write my S's backwards.

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,400
I’ve made like an @ sign, 
which is like a D and an A,

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,110
and I make an M,

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,210
and then I’ve got 
an arrow at the end

25
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,210
that just kind of symbolizes

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,909
that my life is on the upwards.”

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,450
“And when I started
actually signing

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,330
like it was really me
mimicking my mom’s signature.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,610
And I still kind of
kept this little curve

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,880
in the signature — that’s
definitely from my mother.”

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,610
“In Russian it’s called ‘roscherk,’
which is like kind of

32
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,740
ending the signature with
some sort of, like, ornament.

33
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,640
Or maybe it’s just 
a character of me

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,600
taking a little more space 
than I require, I don’t know.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,990
But my wife always rolls her eyes.”

36
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,270
“I was always told that
it was too involved.

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,780
But I maintain that it’s a
necessary part of my style.”

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,120
“So this one is called

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,720
‘I’m in a rush to get out 
of this restaurant.’

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,720
The few times a year that
I'm actually writing checks,

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,870
then I actually do 
a connected signature.”

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,160
”You know really you only 
need to have a signature

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,734
for legally binding 
contracts at this point.

44
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:06,260
And then I’m sure at 
one point that won’t even be it.

45
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,190
Because you know we can sign
things electronically now. So ...”

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,060
“I would miss it.

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,940
There’s nothing more fabulous
than having a conversation:

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,180
‘Oh, yes, thank you.’

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,360
That is just so fun.

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,660
Like who doesn’t —

51
00:02:20,660 --> 00:00:00,000
Who doesn’t like it? Especially
if it’s a really good place.”
