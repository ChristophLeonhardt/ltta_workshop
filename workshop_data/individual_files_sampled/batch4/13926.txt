well I hate to be the bearer of bad news but a few days ago while you were spending the Clavin last weekend hunkered in your underground bunkers wondering if in the aftermath you'd be able to trade gold bars and water bottles for the last extant DVD of Southside with you it turns out we missed women's equality day I know right very very sad if we have been together for women's equality day we could have begun to set aside the gender differences imposed on us by society during the Great Society gender difference imposing conspiracy and we could have begun to treat one another as absolute equals if you're a woman for instance you could have stopped regarding me as if I were a quote man unquote and begun to treat me just as you would treat a quote woman unquote if you were a quote man unquote for instances I walked by in the hall you could have said something like good morning glory what's your story and then given me a light slap on the backside and instead of reacting to you is if you were somehow a quote woman unquote I could have reacted just as I would have reacted if a man had done that by punching you so hard that your ears flew off the sides of your head and embedded themselves in my alright sorry about that but unfortunately we missed women's equality day so all we can do is address one another politely as we passed like gendered ships in the night heading for a life imprisoned within the sexual identities society imposed on us right after two or three million years of human evolution created them but if only everyday we're women's equality day then every woman would know that instead of getting married and coming under the sway of some man who loved her instead of raising a bunch of children who would keep annoying her by rising up and calling her blessed all the time because she was the one person in all the world who knew what they were really like and loved them any way she could go to work in a business that manufactured gizmos or even widgets and come under the sway of a man who didn't give a damn about her or even a woman who didn't give a damn about her but was happy to use her as a gear and a great machine turning out ultimately useless stuff that would not rise up and call her blessed because it was already obsolete and had to be thrown away to make room for more useless stuff but alas women's equality day is over and so instead we have to get used to the fact that the gender differences society imposed on us after God created them are one of the chief sources of joy and consolation for just about everyone on earth but a small number of crabbed dissatisfied neurotic feminists harridans to whom we at the Andrew Clavin show would just like to say happy women's equality day now it's over get me a beer trigger warning I'm from Clavin and this is the Andrew Cleveland show I knew I wasn't gonna get through that but I just have to rehearse these like a hundred and fifty times before I come alright we're gonna

Huma Abedin has had it with now you know why a Jewish guy married to a radical Muslim lesbian would have a problem sexual problem I don't know you know maybe at night she tries to take his side of the bed away from him I die who knows what it is but Huma finally this is the third time this has become a scandal and this time was this time was really even worse he was sexting with somebody and he loves to sex pictures of himself in a state of arousal mr. Weiner likes the second you know send pictures of himself when he gets excited and he did it while his son is four or five year old son had crawled up on the bed next to him so the picture that he sends is of him his shorts basically with this little kid lying next to him so Huma finally said she put out a statement saying after long and painful consideration and work on my marriage I have made the decision to separate from my husband Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son who is the light of our life during this difficult time I asked for respect for our privacy sources said Abbadon was furious and sickened by the picture of Weiner and their son according to two people close to the family the sources said she did not know about it or details of the latest sexting sex teen exchange until this weekend it was in the New York Post and there's some talk the Child Protective Services is gonna get involved in this I would think so I mean if you or I did something like this that you know you CPS would definitely get a call so Trump reacted to this in an interesting way he said Trump Trump has never liked Anthony Weiner he has like hammered Weiner and he just thinks yeah and we'll get back to that in a minute but he put out a statement saying Huma is making a very wise decision I know Anthony Weiner well and she will be far better off without him but he went on I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information who knows what he learned and who he told it's just another example of Hillary Clinton's bad judgment it is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this so you went political on it and well let's first look at the react we have Clinton spokeswoman Andrea Mitchell of CNN interviewing Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Granholm I think yeah that's how it works on the left you know we we've been make we sit around we make fun of Trump interviewing Trump of a Hannity interviewing Trump all the time which has become a bit absurd it's Hannity putting words in Trump's mouth Hannity just celebrating Trump there's nothing journalistic about it it's just an arm of his campaign but that's the entire mainstream media that is what the mainstream media does all day long so here is Clinton's Andrea Mitchell interviewing Clintons Jennifer Granholm Donald Trump telling the New York Times now that this is probably you know a good thing the separation but then suggesting that Anthony Weiner may have had access to classified information through his wife that is ridiculous that is ridiculous I mean I think that Donald Trump and everyone else should respect the privacy of Huma Abedin who is as you know an utterly graceful wonderful human being who's going through a terrible situation and who's tried to keep our marriage together so I say let us respect their privacy and his nonsense about classified information okay wait so just so I'm sure this is the Huma Abedin who helps set up meetings with anybody who'd given much money to the Clinton Foundation and used to edit a radical Islamic anti-female magazine with her mom and who has been through this now three times oh we have to respect her privacy I'm not seeing that at all I'm sorry and why is it you know I have to say you know Trump is going political and that's part of his job at this moment but I don't see why it's nonsense at all I've you know at what point at what point whereas Hillary Clinton's confidential information are confidential information that she was sending out on her private server at what point was it so secure that it's nonsense that this woman that her top aides husband who is clearly a limit I don't think it's a nonsense at all so let's I just want to go back a little bit just just so we understand how this is going to play out take a look let's take a walk down Weiner memory okay we're going through we remember Elaine starts out I think it's 2011 and our friend andrew breitbart is sitting around obsessively going through his Twitter feed which is what Andrew used to do and he sees this tweet obscene tweet coming out from Weiner's Twitter feed and it's instantly erased and he goes out he sends it to the press and who do they attack they attack Andrew Breitbart okay and I mean they piled on it so here's Weiner and watch that watch this video this is weiners first excuse look at this guy and listen to his voice listen to the absolute conviction with which he lies and the absolute abandon with which he lies about the whole thing well let's keep in mind what happened here I was pranked I was hacked I was punked whatever it is someone sent out a picture I'm an easy name to make fun of and I think that that's what happened again I it's a terrible thing that this poor woman got dragged into it she says she knows nothing about it and I obviously don't know anything about it I didn't send that picture out but that's not a picture of you you know I can't say with certitude my system was hacked pictures can be manipulated pictures can be dropped in and inserted one of the reasons that I've asked a firm that includes an Internet security arm is to take a look at what the heck happened here was to make sure it doesn't happen again but let's kind of keep in mind why this is so silly you know someone committed a prank on me somehow got access to my Twitter account by the way at you know put up a picture that made fun of name Weiner and that's what happened yeah that's what happened and that's a you know that's a well-thought-out lie by the way because he doesn't deny that it's his body which could probably be checked and somebody might say no I I know that guy from buy his pants you know and like he can you know they that could be checked but it's a pretty well thought out lie so the press almost universally reacted by saying well it's Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Breitbart lies and they did everybody did it so here's here's just the one that I found easily it's saying can you pronounce his last name on hunger sink and he's the young turk who is now kind of risen in the ranks so that he gets quoted as if he were rely on source here he is reacting to the opening of the scandal after Weiner makes his excuse to me it's exceedingly clear he didn't send a picture he doesn't know who the girl is he doesn't know who he is in person she knows him as a congressman but she's never met him so all this is nonsense but yesterday Andrew Breitbart who of course is a notorious liar and who's been the man main guy pushing this story complained that the mainstream media aren't covering the story enough quote if this were a Republican it becomes a single most important story in the history of media for three weeks four weeks now come on are you claiming that Democratic sex scandals aren't covered enough in this country have you ever heard of a guy called Bill Clinton yeah Bill Clinton they buried that story until Drudge broke it they dredge forced that story then the mainstream media's throat they had it they were gonna print it they spiked it and Drudge broke it okay and every other scandal works the same way they get whitewashed I mean it's not that they don't cover the scandals if they have to but Eliot Spitzer right governor of New York really hard-driving prosecutor against businesses he gets caught going to prostitutes he had to resign as governor but then wanted to reconstitute his career they made a movie a documentary client nine because that's what the prostitutes called him client nine I watched this documentary from beginning to end it's a whitewash it starts out you know with kind of telling the truth but very very slowly starts to pin everything on evil Republicans it's the new york times playbook you know when the new york times whenever there's a democrat scandal the headline is republicans try to take hold of democrat scandal and that's what they did with Eliot Spitzer they tried to do it with Weiner they made a documentary about Weiner because because he was running for mayor and they were gonna reconstitute him and you know save him from himself but he did it again he did it again okay so and and after this happened after the first time the New York Times a former newspaper ran this huge story about what a wonderful guy was very sympathetic and Jonathan van Meter wrote it and he wrote that he listening to his excuse now this is after the excuses Albany listening to the excuse he says it was not entirely there was not it was the not it was it wasn't such an implausible theory after all his excuse because it was the not entirely reputable right wing blogger Andrew Breitbart who broke the story so Breitbart was a liar okay and then of course Weiner confesses at the outset I'd like to make you clear that I had made terrible mistakes that have hurt the people I care about the most and I'm deeply sorry I have not been honest with myself my family my constituents my friends and supporters and the media last Friday night I tweeted a photograph of myself that I intended to send us a direct message as part of a joke to a woman in Seattle once I realized I had posted it to Twitter I panicked I took it down and said that I had been hacked I then continued with that story to stick to that story which was a hugely regrettable mistake this woman was unwittingly dragged into this and bears absolutely no responsibility I am so sorry to have disrupted her life in this way to be clear the picture was of me and I sent it I'm deeply sorry for the pain this has caused my wife Huma and our family and my constituents my friends supporters and staff just to point out he's still lying he's still lying it was a joke it was all you know it was like you know he's still he's all teared up but it's it's still baloney now stick with me I'm doing this for a reason I know I'm going back in time but there there is a reason for this after this of course that came that wonderful moment this was probably the pinnacle of bright Bart's life right Bart called me about five minutes after this happened because this these kinds of things happen it really there really was an angel watching over Andrew I mean I think they knew he only had a little bit of time and they were gonna give him some good stuff before he left us Breitbart was going to his hotel after this after this confession happens he's going to his hotel and he looks in and there's a press conference going on and he says what's this and they said the press is waiting for for Anthony Weiner and Breitbart says oh well I'll go talk though oh no I guess not I go what happened called on him they they demanded that he come in he wandered in and they said oh there's andrew breitbart get on stage get on stage so Breitbart got on stage and he explained this to people who had been calling him wire for the last like two weeks he explained 72 hours I guess it was they were calling him a liar liar liar and he explained what happened and then he had this wonderful redeeming moment everything that I've said so far has come to be true I'd like to hear one the media says Breitbart Lies Breitbart lies Breitbart lies Breitbart lies give me one example of a provable lie one one journalist one put your reputation on the line here one provable lie all right we're gonna get great mobile we're gonna get to the point of this in a minute but if you're at on Facebook or YouTube you got to come over to the Daily wire and hear the rest
