STEVE BANNON IS NOW LOOSE AND
OUT IN THE WILD IF YOU WILL.
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARISES
OUT OF THAT SITUATION IS, IS
THERE GOING TO BE MORE STABILITY
AT THE WHITE HOUSE NOW?
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
LET'S BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT IN A
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS.
FIRST, WASHINGTON POST HAS THE
STORY.
THEY EXPLAIN:
STEVE BANNON SAID THAT IN AN
INTERVIEW WITH THEM, SO HE
IS SAYING NO ADMINISTRATION HAS
EVER BEEN THIS DIVIDED.
STEVE BANNON IS CORRECT ABOUT
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN A WHITE HOUSE
THIS DIVIDED.
I MEAN, OBAMA TALKED ABOUT
HAVING A TEAM OF RIVALS.
THIS IS A TEAM OF RIVALS.
NO, OBAMA'S WAS INCREDIBLY CALM,
COOL, AND COLLECTED AND AS
MUCH AS THERE WERE FLAREUPS FROM
TIME TO TIME WITH BUSH AND
CLINTON, REAGAN, NOTHING LIKE
THIS.
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MADHOUSE
OVER THERE AND IT IS PARTLY
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT AGREE.
IT IS ALSO PARTLY BECAUSE OF EGO
AND IN MY OPINION, THEY ARE
ALL BAD GUYS AND SO WHAT DO BAD
GUYS DO?
THEY STAB EACH OTHER IN THE
BACK.
ALL OF THAT HAS ADDED UP TO
COMPLETE CHAOS AND PLUS,
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART WHICH
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
MORE IN A SECOND IS NO ONE IS
HOME.
THERE IS NO BOSS.
THERE IS NO COMPETENT LEADER
THAT IS ALLOWING THEM TO DO
THIS.
BANNON IS RIGHT ABOUT
THE SECOND PART TOO WHICH
IS THAT IN THAT DIVIDED
LEADERSHIP OR DIVIDED HOUSE WITH
NO LEADERSHIP, THE ESTABLISHMENT
GUYS HAVE LARGELY WON.
THERE IS TALK OF BUILDING A WALL
BUT NOT MUCH AS BEEN DONE
ABOUT IT.
THE TRADE WARS THAT WERE
PROMISED TO CHINA AND OTHER
FOLKS HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED AT
ALL.
INSTEAD, MORE OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT HEY, LET'S
KEEP EVERYTHING CALM AND COOL
AND MAKE SURE WE JUST GET
TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH AND WHO
CARES ABOUT THE OTHER PART OF
YOUR AGENDA WHICH MIGHT ACTUALLY
HURT OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS.
THAT IS OUT, THAT IS GONE.
JUST ABOUT EVERY POLICY ISSUE
YOU LOOK AT.
THE POPULIST WING OF TRUMP IS
NOT WINNING.
YOU CAN SAY HEY, THEY ARE
WINNING ON THE WHOLE WHITE
NATIONALIST STUFF.
IF YOU CAN CALL THAT A WIN.
BUT OBVIOUSLY STEVE BANNON WAS
KICKED OUT PARTLY BECAUSE
OF THOSE REASONS, SO THEY ARE
NOT WINNING ON THAT ANYMORE.
THEY ARE A MESS.
SECOND OF ALL, THAT MISUNDERSTANDS
THEIR MANDATE, WHATEVER
LITTLE MANDATE THAT THEY
HAD, WHICH WAS TO BE ñ
AND BANOON WROTE ABOUT THIS
TOO, DO ECONOMIC POPULISM.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, HIS POLICY
IDEAS ARE HORRIBLY WRONG AND IF
THE COUNTRY WENT IN THAT
DIRECTION, IT WOULD GREATLY
HURT THE COUNTRY BUT IN TERMS OF
POLITICS THAT IS WHAT HIS
BASE ELECTED HIM FOR.
THEY DON'T LIKE THE
ESTABLISHMENT.
THEY PUT TRUMP IN OFFICE
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE WAS
WORKING AGAINST THE
ESTABLISHMENT.
IF HE WAS RUNNING
AGAINST ANOTHER POPULIST
HE MOST CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE
WON, BUT HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST
AN INCREDIBLY ESTABLISHMENT
FIGURE AND HILLARY CLINTON.
THIS DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR TRUMP
ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
WAYS BECAUSE OF THAT.
THEY CLAIM FURTHER:
LOOK, TAXES ARE EASY.
THEY ALL AGREE ON GIANTS
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAX
CUTS FOR THE RICH.
THEY WILL DO THAT WHETHER IT IS
WITH TRUMP OR NOT.
THAT IS REPUBLICAN 101,
SO THAT IS THE ONE AREA THEY ARE
ALL ALIGNED ON AND THAT IS WHY I
HAVE SAID FROM DAY ONE, IF
THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN BANK
ON IT IS GIANT TAX CUTS FOR
THE RICH AND MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATIONS.
ON TRADE, THEY DO NOT AGREE SO
BANNON IS NOT LIKELY TO
WIN IN WHICH CASE THEY START
GETTING ANGRY AND ATTACKING
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
GOOD NEWS TO THE REST OF US.
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT TO
WIN ON IS, EVEN PAUL RYAN
HAS SAID, LOOK THESE TAX CUTS
ARE SO ENORMOUS AND IT IS
GOING TO CREATE GIANT DEFICITS.
IF YOU THOUGHT DEFICITS WERE BAD
UNDER DEMOCRATS, FIRST OF
ALL, THAT IS BECAUSE GEORGE W
BUSH, OBAMA GOT THE DEFICITS
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HE
ACTUALLY DECREASED IT BY 50%
BUT IF YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS BAD,
WAIT UNTIL YOU GET A LOAD
OF THE DEFICITS AFTER THIS TAX
CUT.
PAUL RYAN KNOWS THAT HE IS
LIKE AND WE ALWAYS DO AND
IMPORTATION TAX?
CORPORATE AMERICA WAS LIKE, NO,
YOU CAN'T.
THE KOCH BROTHERS LIKE NO, WE
GET A LOT OF STUFF FROM MEXICO.
YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO
THAT.
AND PAUL RYAN SAID SORRY SIR,
ABSOLUTELY.
TAX CUTS,
NOTHING ELSE.
THEY WILL GET ANY OF THAT STUFF
AND HENCE, THERE WILL BE
MORE INVITING IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
NOW WE GO TO MATT SCHLAPP, THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN
CONSERVATIVE UNION.
THEY'RE BACKING STEVE BANNON'S
CREW HERE.
AS A CHILD, I DON'T SEE WHY
ANYONE WOULD BE STEVE BANNON.
HE COULD STRIP SOMEONE FROM
HIS BASE AND THAT IS A
LEGITIMATE CONCERN FOR THE
PRESIDENT.
IF YOU ARE A
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSPERSON THE
IDEA OF BEING AFRAID OF
STEVE BANNON SHOULD BE
LAUGHABLE.
HE IS SUCH A POLARIZING FIGURE.
HE IS NOTHING BUT AN ALLY FOR
YOU POLITICALLY IN THAT
SENSE AND YOU SHOULD ATTACK HIM
WITH 100% FEROCITY.
NOT SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATIC
ESTABLISHMENT IS FAMILIAR
WITH BUT MAN IS THIS A
SOFT TARGET.
IF YOU CANíT
HIT THIS TARGET YOU BETTER GET
OUT OF THE GAME.
BUT THERE WAS ONE OTHER
INTERESTING THING IN THAT QUOTE.
WHICH IS HE IS WELL-FUNDED.
IT DOESNíT MAKE ANY MONEY.
BREITBART HAS LOST 90%
OF ITS ADVERTISERS SINCE THIS
ADMINISTRATION BEGAN AND
THEIR VIEWER NUMBERS, THE READER
NUMBERS ARE IN THE TANK.
HOW ARE THEY WELL-FUNDED?
BECAUSE ON THE RIGHT, THEY DON'T
RUN REAL BUSINESSES.
IT IS JUST PROPAGANDA OUTLETS.
THE MERCERS, WHO ARE THE WHITE
NATIONALIST WALL STREET GUYS.
THEY ARE A FUN COMBO OF RACIST
AND WALL STREET ABUSE, ARE
FUNDING BREITBART.
THEY ARE LIKE, WE WANT PROPAGANDA
FOR WHITE NATIONALISM AND
GIANT TAX CUTS AND OUR EXTREME
RIGHT WING POSITION AND
OBVIOUSLY, YOU LOSERS.
BREITBART CAN'T MAKE ANY MONEY.
COME ON, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
A CONSERVATIVE PUBLICATION
EVERY MADE MONEY.
NEW YORK POST, WEEKLY STANDARD
HAS A COMICALLY LOW
CIRCULATION RATE.
ALL THESE PUBLICATIONS ARE
DISASTERS, THEY ARE NOT
WINNING WITH THEM.
THEY ARE A MESS.
GUYS LIKE MERCER HAVE TO COME IN
AND PROP THEM UP.
IT IS INTERESTING THAT THERE IS
STILL THAT MONEY OUT THERE
FOR BREITBART TO GO NOT ONLY
CAUSE TROUBLE FOR DEMOCRATS,
BUT ALSO ESTABLISHMENT
REPUBLICANS AND WITH THAT WE
GET, AND I CAN RESPECT THAT, BUT
ALSO, FOR THEIR OWN PRESIDENT.
IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY, WE
ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR BALL AND
GO HOME AND DAMN THE TORPEDOES.
IT IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD
STRATEGY FOR THEM OVERALL,
BUT MUSIC TO MY EARS.
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS GOING TO
BE, THIS CONFLICT?
HERE'S ANOTHER EXCERPT FROM THE
POST.
TALK OF CRUSHING OPPOSITION IS
FAIRLY STANDARD, ESPECIALLY
ONLINE.
HAVING HIS WEAPONS BACK IN
BREITBART, OKAY, IT IS
RIGHT WING TALK.
NOT A BIG DEAL.
FOR THE REST OF US I DON'T
THINK, BUT AGAIN, IF YOU
ARE THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AND
YOU JUST TAKE THIS GUY ALAN
HE IS TALKING ABOUT GRABBING HIS
WEAPONS AND HE ALSO CALLED
BREITBART A KILLING MACHINE.
QUESTIONABLE RIGHT WING
TERMINOLOGY THERE, BUT THAT
IS PROBLEMATIC OF COURSE.
NOW WE GO TO A REPUBLICAN
STRATEGIST WHO SAYS:
THAT MEANS YEAH, YOU MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN RID OF BANNON AND
PRIEBUS AND SEAN SPICER AND
SCARAMUCCI, BUT THEY ARE
NOT THE ONES WHO ARE CAUSING THE
PROBLEM.
THEY ARE A SYMPTOM OF THE
PROBLEM.
THE PROBLEM IS DONALD TRUMP.
THE GUY IS A TOTAL CLOWN.
END OF THE WASHINGTON POST OR A
HERE SAYS:
THERE IS NO EVIDENT STRATEGY
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS IN
CHARGE.
YOU CAN HAVE STEVE BANNON GO
AND IT MIGHT BE IMMEDIATELY
HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU RESTORE
SOME DEGREE OF ORDER IN THE
WHITE HOUSE, LONG-TERM, IT MAY
BE DAMAGING BECAUSE HE IS GOING
TO FIRE ALL OF HIS CANNONS ON
YOU APPARENTLY AT SOME POINT BUT
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT ISN'T
GOING TO HELP ANYTHING BECAUSE
THE SOURCE OF THE INSTABILITY
WAS NOT STEVE BANNON.
THE SOURCE OF SOME OF THE HATRED
AND THE WHITE NATIONALISM
MIGHT'VE BEEN BANNON, BUT THE
SOURCE OF THE INSTABILITY IS THE
PRESIDENT HIMSELF SO THE END OF
THE DAY, YOU HAVE SOLVED NOTHING
AND PROBABLY CREATED MORE
HEADACHES FOR YOURSELF NOW
THAT YOU ARE IN SOME WAYS GOING
TO WAR WITH YOUR BASE.
THAT SHOULD BE FUN.
