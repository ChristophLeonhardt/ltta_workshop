1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,701
THEM THAT ARE OLD OR DYING OR 

2
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:02,234
SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE THE 

3
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,670
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS, THOSE 

4
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,805
BRANCHES AND TREES ARE EXPECTED 

5
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:11,243
TO COME DOWN ONTO HOMES AND 

6
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:12,679
BUILDINGS, WHICH COULD CAUSE 

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,079
INJURY OR DEATH. 

8
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,247
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE WANTING TO 

9
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,283
GET PEOPLE INTO SHELTERS AWAY 

10
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,818
FROM TREES BUT ALSO THAT WILL 

11
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:19,719
CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE 

12
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,420
POWER OUTAGES EXPECTED 

13
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,887
THROUGHOUT THE AREA. 

14
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,289
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH 

15
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,391
LATE AFTERNOON INTO EVENING FOR 

16
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,525
THE TALLAHASSEE AREA AND THEN 

17
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,859
IT MOVES ON OUT OF HERE. 

18
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,261
THEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT 

19
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:33,532
DAMAGE IT LEFT BEHIND. 

20
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:34,968
WE SHOULD SHOW THAT AS FAR AS 

21
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,069
POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE WINDS 

22
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,270
GET CONSISTENT AT ABOUT 35 

23
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,705
MILES PER HOUR, AND WE MAY BE 

24
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,772
THERE VERY SOON, THAT IS WHEN 

25
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:45,111
THE POWER COMPANY SAYS IT'S NO 

26
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,047
LONGER SAFE FOR CREWS TO BE OUT 

27
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,481
AND ABOUT TRYING TO RESTORE 

28
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,149
WHATEVER POWERLINES MAY HAVE 

29
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,984
BEEN KNOCKED DOWN EARLY ON IN 

30
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,350
THE STORM. 

31
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,152
THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT 

32
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:52,418
ANYMORE. 

33
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,719
SO IT MAY NOT BE TILL TOMORROW 

34
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,088
WHEN THEY GET DAYLIGHT AND THE 

35
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,489
WINDS HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS 

36
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,891
AREA THAT THEY ARE FINALLY ABLE 

37
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,825
TO START CLEARING TREES AND 

38
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,095
TRYING TO RESTORE POWER. 

39
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,397
THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES WHEN IT 

40
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,298
COMES TO RESTORING POWER. 

41
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,499
HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES, 

42
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:07,167
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, 

43
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,035
THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY WILL 

44
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,271
TRY TO GET BACK ONLINE FIRST. 

45
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,339
CLEARLY, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. 

46
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,174
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 

47
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:18,044
THE POWER THE MOST AND THE MOST 

48
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,746
QUICKLY, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A 

49
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,047
ROUGH GO HERE IN TALLAHASSEE AS 

50
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,114
WE START TO SEE THOSE REPORTS 

51
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:24,050
FROM THE COAST AND A SLIGHTLY 

52
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,583
WEAKER VERSION OF MICHAEL 

53
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:33,259
BEGINS TO MAKE ITS WAY HERE TO 

54
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,027
THE STATE CAPITAL. 

55
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,728
>> MANNY, YOU LIVE IN MIAMI FOR 

56
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,763
YOU KNOW ABOUT HURRICANE 

57
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,330
COVERAGE AND PREPARATION. 

58
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,297
I'M JUST CURIOUS, THE FOLKS YOU 

59
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:39,832
HAVE SPOKEN TO, WHAT ARE THE 

60
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,367
STORES LIKE THEIR AND WHAT HAVE 

61
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,069
YOU DONE TO PREPARE AND WHAT DO 

62
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,070
PEOPLE ADVISE YOU TO DO WHEN 

63
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,540
YOU KNOW THIS IS COMING? 

64
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,408
>> WELL, WE GOT HERE AND, AS 

65
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:50,543
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LAND IN ONE 

66
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,845
OF THESE AREAS RIGHT BEFORE A 

67
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:52,712
DISASTER, YOU LOOK FOR WATER 

68
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:53,680
FOR YOUR CREW AND YOURSELF. 

69
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,115
THE FIRST WALMART I WENT TO WAS 

70
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:55,881
OUT OF BREAD AND WATER. 

71
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:58,184
SO PEOPLE DID PREPARE. 

72
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,052
THERE WERE GAS LINES. 

73
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:01,454
WE ARE NOT SEEING MANY OF THOSE 

74
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,822
NOW AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE GAS 

75
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:03,857
STATIONS HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP 

76
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,191
UP THEIR PUMPS HOPING TO SAVE 

77
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,725
THEM FROM WATER DAMAGE. 

78
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,794
WE HAVE HEARD THE OFFICIALS SAY 

79
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:14,267
IT OVER AND OVER, IF YOU ARE NO 

80
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,868
LONGER PREPARED OR IF YOU ARE 

81
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:16,703
STILL TRYING TO PREPARE, I 

82
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,838
SHOULD SAY, THE TIME IS UP. 

83
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,573
RIGHT NOW IT IS BRACED FOR IT, 

84
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,474
HUNKER DOWN, GET INDOORS TO THE 

85
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:28,081
INNERMOST PART OF ANY BUILDING. 

86
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:28,715
YOU MENTIONED THE LESSONS 

87
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,183
LEARNED FROM LIVING IN SOUTH 

88
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:35,421
FLORIDA ESPECIALLY AT, LAST 

89
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:35,621
YEAR. 

90
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:36,356
YOU'LL RECALL THE HORRIBLE 

91
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,390
INCIDENT AT A NURSING HOME 

92
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,992
WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER THE 

93
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,626
POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOUR DAYS 

94
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,860
AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET 

95
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,894
THE POWER BACK TO THE BUILDING. 

96
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,796
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 

97
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,096
GENERATOR. 

98
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,099
THERE IS A NEW LINE FLORIDA 

99
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,367
AIMING TO PREVENT THAT KIND OF 

100
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,103
TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING AGAIN 

101
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:50,870
AND REQUIRING ALL NURSING HOMES 

102
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,841
AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES 

103
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,608
TO HAVE GENERATORS. 

104
00:02:55,608 --> 00:03:00,880
BUT AFTER THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 

105
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,782
1st PAST, NUMBERS SHOW A LOT OF 

106
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:03,750
THOSE FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN 

107
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,218
THIS AREA, DO NOT HAVE THOSE 

108
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,920
INSTALLED JUST YET FOR MANY 

109
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,187
REASONS. 

110
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:08,620
ZONING REGULATIONS. 

111
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,989
WE ARE TOLD THERE IS A LABOR 

112
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,426
SHORTAGE AND A SHORTAGE OF 

113
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,193
THOSE SUPPLIES, BUT THEY STILL 

114
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,528
HAVE TO PROVE THEY CAN KEEP 

115
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,496
RESIDENTS SAFE AND THAT 

116
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,163
SOMETHING THE STATE IS LOOKING 

117
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,933
VERY CLOSELY INTO AND THAT'S 

118
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,767
WHY THE POWER COMPANIES ARE 

119
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,567
LOOKING TO PRIORITIZE THOSE 

120
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,435
AREAS TO PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE 

121
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,235
THAT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. 

122
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:30,076
AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE TREES, 

123
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:30,777
THEY REALLY GET GOING. 

124
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,045
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S 

125
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,346
STARTING TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT 

126
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:33,746
MORE CONSISTENT. 

127
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:34,747
IT'S NO LONGER ONCE EVERY 10 

128
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:35,381
MINUTES, IT'S STARTING TO 

129
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,816
BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A 

130
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,552
REGULAR FLOW THROUGH HERE. 

131
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,219
CLEARLY, MICHAEL IS GETTING 

132
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:40,453
CLOSER. 

133
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,120
>> INTERESTING YOU CAN PREDICT 

134
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,789
THAT BY LOOKING AT THE TREES 

135
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,024
FOR YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

136
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,424
PLEASE STAY SAFE. 

137
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:51,564
WE WILL CHECK IN THROUGHOUT THE 

138
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:51,897
AFTERNOON. 

139
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,199
>> AND WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE 

140
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,833
COVERAGE WHEN WE RETURN. 

141
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,701
FOR NOW, A QUICK BREAK. 

142
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,636
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 

143
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,294
>>> WELL, WE ARE GOING TO BE 

144
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,095

147
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,134
ON THE OTHER NEWS AS WELL.

SEVERAL NAMES HAVE SURFACED AS

TO SAY ABOUT THE SEARCH TODAY. 

164
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:41,901
>> DENA DID GREAT HERE. 

165
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,136
SHE THEN WENT BACK INTO THE 

166
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,404
PRIVATE SECTOR FOR A WHILE, BUT 

167
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,838
SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO COME BACK. 

168
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:46,472
SHE LOVES THIS ADMINISTRATION. 

169
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,807
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT DENA AND 

170
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,176
OTHERS. 

171
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,844
SOME TREMENDOUSLY TALENTED 

172
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:57,150
PEOPLE. 

173
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,751

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, WHAT ARE 

177
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,655
YOU HEARING ABOUT HOW THE 

178
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,090

181
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:07,325
THE LIST. 

182
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:08,561

00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:14,700
ADMINISTRATION, SHE DOES HAVE 

187
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,170
STATE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER 

188
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,838
WHITE HOUSE EXPERIENCE, SO SHE 

189
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,641
IS SEEN AS THE RARE CANDIDATE 

190
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:29,248
WHO IS SATISFACTORY TO THE 

191
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,116
ESTABLISHMENT. GOLDMAN SACHS IS 

192
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,384
KIND OF THE DEFINITION OF THE 

193
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,018
ESTABLISHMENT, BUT SHE'S CLOSE 

194
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,218
WITH TOM COTTEN, DONALD TRUMP, 

195
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,421
TRUMPS KIDS, AND SO WE SHOULD 

196
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,124
KEEP AN EYE ON HER. 

197
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,427
OTHER CANDIDATES INCLUDE RICK 

198
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,495
GRENELL, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR OF 

199
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,462
GERMANY, ALTHOUGH TRUMP THREW 

200
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:49,235
COLD WATER ON THAT SAYING THAT 

201
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,369
WE LIKE RICK THERE, INDICATING 

202
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,437
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BRING HIM 

203
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:51,904
BACK JUST YET. 

204
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,339
>> WHAT SORT OF CAUGHT OUR EYE 

205
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,473
WAS IN AN INTERVIEW TODAY, THE 

206
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,608
FORMER WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST 

207
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,342
STEVE BANNON CALLED THE TIMING 

208
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,845
OF THE RESIGNATION HORRIFIC AND 

209
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,912
SAYS IT'S A GOOD DISTRACTION 

210
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,948
FROM TRUMPS GOOD TALKING POINTS 

211
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,448
HEADING INTO MIDTERMS. 

212
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,549
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? 

213
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,686
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE REACTION 

214
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,019
FROM BANNON? 

215
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:07,887
WE HAVE SEEN BREITBART PUSHING 

216
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,656
BACK HARD AS TO WHY DINA POWELL 

217
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:20,433
SHOULD NOT MAKE IT ON AS U.S. 

218
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:20,933
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.? 

219
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,134
>> THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD IT IN FOR 

220
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:22,367
POWELL. 

221
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,769
THEY SEE HER AS A GLOBALIST WHO 

222
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,670
WORKS FOR A TOP INVESTMENT 

223
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,073
BANK, AND THEY DON'T THINK THAT 

224
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,441
POWELL REPRESENTS WHAT THE, YOU 

225
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,810
KNOW, AMERICAN VOTERS STOOD FOR 

226
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,078
WHEN ELECTING TRUMP A YEAR AND 

227
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,913
A HALF AGO, AND SO IT'S VERY 

228
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:41,220
CONCERNING TO THEM THAT DINA 

229
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,388
WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS 

230
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:42,621
JOB. 

231
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:43,155
YOU KNOW, THEY SAVAGELY 

232
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,423
ATTACKED HER WHEN SHE WAS IN 

233
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,293
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SO NOT A 

234
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,293
HUGE SURPRISE BANNON IS MAKING 

235
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:48,660
THOSE COMMENTS. 

236
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,033
BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S 

237
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,067
INTERESTING THAT HE IS, 

238
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:55,667
BASICALLY, ATTACKING NIKKI 

239
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,204
HALEY CALLED TRUMP REALLY LIKES 

240
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,505
AND SHE IS LIVING ON HER OWN 

241
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,539
TERMS, NOT GETTING PUSHED OUT 

242
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,540
TO YOU SHE HAD A PRETTY 

243
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,742
POSITIVE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH 

244
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:07,547
TRUMP YESTERDAY, AND SO NOT 

245
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:13,119
TOTALLY CLEAR WHY BANNON IS 

246
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,319
GOING AFTER ONE OF TRUMPS 

247
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:14,920
FAVORITE PEOPLE. 

248
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,354
>> ALL RIGHT. 

249
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,589
GRATEFUL TO GET YOU ON AND 

250
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,122
TALKS IN POLITICS. 

251
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,492
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING 

252
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:19,658
US. 

253
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,293
>> THANKS, REENA. 

254
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:25,831
>>> WE TURNED BACK TO HURRICANE 

255
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,166
MATTHEW. 

256
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:27,700
JEFF JOINS US NOW. 

257
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,701
THE EYE WALL, YOU WERE TELLING 

258
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,202
ME, IS MAKING LANDFALL AT THIS 

259
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,105
VERY MOMENT. 

260
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:33,739
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

261
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,507
>> WELL, IT MEANS A VERY LARGE 

262
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:36,842
TORNADO IS RIGHT ON TOP OF THE 

263
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,275
COAST RIGHT NOW. 

264
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,110
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD COMPARE 

265
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,878
THIS HURRICANE TOO. 

266
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,247
SO OFTEN THE STORMS WE CAN AS 

267
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:41,746
THEY MAKE LANDFALL. 

268
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,915
THIS ONE IS STRENGTHENING AS IT 

269
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:47,153
MAKES LANDFALL AND I THINK IT 

270
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:47,686
IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION. 

271
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:48,954
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG 

272
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:49,154
TIME. 

273
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,089
I LIVED IN FLORIDA DOING 

274
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,325
HURRICANES FOR YEARS. 

275
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:57,630
MIAMI, TAMPA, PALM BEACH. I CAN 

276
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,031
TELL YOUFOR SURE THAT STORMS 

277
00:09:59,031 --> 00:09:59,765
STRENGTHEN AS THEY MAKE 

278
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,032
LANDFALL. 

279
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,167
THEY MAKE A LOT MORE LANDFALL 

280
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,101
THAN IF THEY ARE WEAKENING. 

281
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,102
THEY HAVE THAT UPWARD MOMENTUM, 

282
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,570
SO THE STORM IS GOING TO BE I 

283
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,971
THINK A PIVOTAL AND KIND OF 

284
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:06,839
LIFE-CHANGING MOMENT FOR A LOT 

285
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:18,084
OF FOLKS THAT LIVES NEAR PANAMA 

286
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:18,284
CITY. 

287
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,819
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 

288
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:20,419
DESTRUCTION TO HOMES THERE. 

289
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,387
HOPEFULLY, AT THIS TIME PEOPLE 

290
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,555
ARE ALREADY IN THEIR SAFE 

291
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,489
SPACE, BECAUSE THEY CAN HEAR 

292
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,490
THE WIND PICKING UP 

293
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:24,823
TREMENDOUSLY. 

294
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:25,257
ALMOST CATEGORY 5. 

295
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:30,229
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, 

296
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:30,596
EXACTLY? 

297
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,831
WE THROUGH THAT AROUND, BUT 

298
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,331
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

299
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,866
>> ABOUT AS STRONG AS IT CAN 

300
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,133
GET. 

301
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,201
MARIA HAD WINS AROUND 155 MILES 

302
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:35,468
PER HOUR. 

303
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,569
THIS TERM HAS WINDS OF 150. 

304
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,203
STRUCTURES, THEORETICALLY, ARE 

305
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,504
BUILT A LITTLE BETTER HERE THAN 

306
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,173
THEY ARE IN PUERTO RICO. 

307
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,043
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, A LOT OF 

308
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:44,510
THESE STRUCTURES ARE 

309
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:44,843
UNCONTESTED. 

310
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:45,610
ALL OF THEM ARE UNTESTED IN 

311
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,479
CATEGORY 4. THIS IS THE STRONG 

312
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,713
STORM TO HIT THE FLORIDA 

313
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,514
PANHANDLE, STRONGEST STORM TO 

314
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,982
HIT THE U.S. IN THE MONTH OF 

315
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,249
OCTOBER. 

316
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,051
HOMES IN FLORIDA AFTER 

317
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:52,718
HURRICANE ANDREW WERE BUILT 

318
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:52,952
BETTER. 

319
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,553
ANY HOME BUILT AFTER 1995 OR SO 

320
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,654
SHOULD BE WILL -- SHOULD BE 

321
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,490
BUILT TO WITHSTAND CATEGORY 3. 

322
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,457
TO BE HONEST, NOT NECESSARILY 

323
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:11,237
BUILT TO WITHSTAND CATEGORY 4. 

324
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,537
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE IS A 

325
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:13,171
LOT OF DESTRUCTION. 

326
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,673
>> JEFF, AT THIS TIME WE KNOW 

327
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,574
IT'S MAKING LANDFALL ACROSS THE 

328
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:15,874
PANHANDLE. 

329
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,109
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING WHEN IT 

330
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:17,676
COMES TO HURRICANE MICHAEL 

331
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,344
QUESTION WORK. 

332
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,545
>> THE STORM SURGE IS COMING 

333
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,214
IN. 

334
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:26,185
I TRIED TO REACH THE WEBSITE TO 

335
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,553
SEE HOW HIGH THE WATER LEVELS 

336
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:27,786
ARE. 

337
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:28,654
PROBABLY EVERYONE IS TRYING TO 

338
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,989
SEE HOW HIGH THE WATER IS 

339
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:30,256
GETTING. 

340
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,158
IT WAS ALREADY IN RECORD 

341
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:32,458
TERRITORY. 

342
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,793
I CAN IMAGINE IT IS COMING ON 

343
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,926
SHORT AND IS LIKELY TO BE AS 

344
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:44,937
HIGH AS 15 FEET. PLACES LIKE 

345
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,838
PORT SAINT JOE, APALACHICOLA, 

346
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:46,771
PANAMA CITY, THAT AREA COULD BE 

347
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:47,540
10 TO 15 FEET. 

348
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,106
THAT IS DEVASTATING. 

349
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,141
WORSE THAN IT WAS WITH 

350
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,276
FLORENCE, AND WINS MUCH WORSE 

351
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,343
THAN IT WAS WITH FLORENCE. 

352
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:51,944
FLORENCE WAS CATEGORY 1 ON 

353
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:52,344
SHORT. 

354
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,213
THIS IS CATEGORY 4. I WOULD 

355
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:54,980
COMPARE THIS TO HURRICANE 

356
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,247
CHARLEY. 

357
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,350
I SEE YOU NODDING YOUR HEAD. 

358
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,852
THAT STORM, IF YOU DROVE PAST 

359
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:04,290
THE DAMAGE, IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG 

360
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,124
TORNADO BULLDOZED A PATH 

361
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:05,524
THROUGH THE AREA. 

362
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:13,799
THIS IS BIGGER THAN THAT. 

363
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,067
THIS IS A STORM PEOPLE REMEMBER 

364
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:15,834
FOR A VERY LONG TIME. 

365
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:16,802
>> HOW DO YOU PREPARE? 

366
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,903
I WAS TALKING WITH MANNY ABOUT 

367
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,072
THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. 

368
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,240
WE HEARD THE DHS SECRETARY SAY 

369
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,741
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT BAG AND 

370
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:29,215
GET PREPARED BEFORE IT ACTUALLY 

371
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,749
STRIKES. 

372
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,016
>> TRUE. 

373
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:31,650
IT'S TOO LATE NOW. 

374
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,052
PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO BE HUNKERED 

375
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:33,519
DOWN IN THEIR HOMES. 

376
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,720
WHEN WE PREDICT CATEGORY 3, WE 

377
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,488
TELL YOU TO PREPARE FOR 

378
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:41,227
CATEGORY 4. WE KNEW THE 

379
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:45,364
POSSIBILITY THIS COULD BE 

380
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,232
CATEGORY 4, AND IT IS. 

381
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,299
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE STORM IS 

382
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:47,666
MOVING FAST. 

383
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,034
THE WORST OF IT IS FROM NOW 

384
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,336
THROUGH THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR 

385
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:50,569
HOURS. 

386
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,704
SOME PEOPLE END UP INSIDE THE 

387
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,339
EYE, WHICH MEANS IT MAY CLEAR 

388
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,139
AND THINGS MAY COME DOWN FOR 10 

389
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:54,807
OR 15 MINUTES. 

390
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,407
DON'T BE FULL. 

391
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,976
IT'S GOING TO PICK UP BIG TIME 

392
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,244
ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE STORM AS 

393
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,246
WELL, BUT I THINK THE WORST OF 

394
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:00,946
IT IN PLACES GETTING HIT 

395
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,414
HARDEST WILL BE THE NEXT FOUR 

396
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:02,647
HOURS. 

397
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,281
THAT MEANS EARLY THIS EVENING 

398
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:04,450
THERE WILL BE HURRICANE FORCE 

399
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,718
WINDS, BUT IT WILL BE GETTING 

400
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,085
BETTER. 

401
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,053
BY LATE THIS EVENING YOU MAY BE 

402
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,622
ABLE TO STEP OUTSIDE AND SEE 

403
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,222
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE YOUR 

404
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,223
DOOR, AND BY TOMORROW, IF THE 

405
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,558
ROADS ARE CLEARED AND THERE IS 

406
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,759
NOT POWER LINES AND TREES DOWN, 

407
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,494
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CHECK ON 

408
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:15,794
YOUR HOUSE. 

409
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,829
MOST PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO 

410
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,496
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THERE WILL 

411
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,898
BE POWER LINES AND TREES DOWN. 

412
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,101
ONE OTHER THING I SHOULD 

413
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:27,773
MENTION, A LOT OF TIMES WHEN 

414
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,640
THESE HURRICANES HIT IN AUGUST, 

415
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,675
YOU DON'T HAVE AIR-CONDITIONING 

416
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,676
FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS. 

417
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,644
THE GOOD NEWS WITH OCTOBER'S 

418
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,111
IT'S COOLER. 

419
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,178
A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFER INJURY 

420
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,914
AFTER JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NO 

421
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:36,781
AIR-CONDITIONING FOR WEEKS. 

422
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,050
IN THIS CASE, COOLER AIR WILL 

423
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,283
GET IN. 

424
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,919
ONE MORE THING, IT WILL MOVE 

425
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,419
THROUGH GEORGIA AND THE 

426
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:40,719
CAROLINAS. 

427
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,287
THE CAROLINA RIVERS ARE 

428
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:41,554
SWOLLEN. 

429
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,454
ANOTHER SIX TO 8 INCHES OF RAIN 

430
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,758
COULD BE POTENTIALLY 

431
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,325
DEVASTATING AGAIN IN THOSE 

432
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:46,759
FLOOD PRONE AREAS. 

433
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,560
>> THAT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR 

434
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:47,893
YOU SAY. 

435
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,195
WE NEVER TALK ABOUT AIR TRAVEL. 

436
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:54,466
HOW DOES THIS IMPACT PEOPLE WHO 

437
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:54,766
ARE FLYING? 

438
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,268
>> YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. 

439
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:56,868
I MEAN, YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE. 

440
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:57,469
I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT ANYWAY. 

441
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:02,708
>> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 

442
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:08,847
TAMPA. 

443
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,682
IF YOU'RE FLYING INTO THESE 

444
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,382
AREAS, EXPECT DELAYS AND FLIGHT 

445
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:10,749
CANCELLATIONS. 

446
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,684
>> TO BE HONEST, I HAVEN'T 

447
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,518
CHECKED WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 

448
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:12,751
TAMPA. 

449
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,686
TAMPA WAS UNDER A TROPICAL 

450
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,020
STORM WARNING, SO I HAVE TO 

451
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,988
THINK THEY ARE NOT FLYING OUT 

452
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,089
OF THEIR AT THE MOMENT. 

453
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,023
MIAMI IS PRETTY FAR AWAY. 

454
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,291
AIRLINES WILL DO THEIR BEST TO 

455
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,326
AVOID THE TURBULENCE AND AVOID 

456
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,760
THE STORM, BUT AT THIS TIME, 

457
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,795
EXPECT DELAYS IF YOU ARE 

458
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,662
TRAVELING ANYWHERE IN THE U.S. 

459
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,496
>> GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US, 

460
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:24,696
JEFF. 

461
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:26,098
>>> WE TAKE YOU NOW TO A 

462
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:36,875
SPECIAL REPORT IN PROGRESS. 

463
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,743
>>> WE ARE SLIGHTLY INLAND, 

464
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,044
THOUGH STILL IN PANAMA CITY 

465
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:39,277
BEACH. 

466
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:40,312
WE ARE GETTING ANOTHER BIG GUST 

467
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,080
COMING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. 

468
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,648
I DID TALK TO THE MANAGER HERE 

469
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,049
FOR PANAMA CITY BEACH A SHORT 

470
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,316
TIME AGO. 

471
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,417
HE ESTIMATED 50% OF RESIDENCE 

472
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:45,917
ACTUALLY LEFT THE AREA. 

473
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:50,089
HE SAID THAT FLORIDIANS, IN HIS 

474
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,190
WORDS, CAN GET COMPLACENT WITH 

475
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,524
STORMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN 

476
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,325
SO MANY BEFORE BUT THEY HAVE 

477
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,527
NOT SEEN MANY LIKE THIS ONE. 

478
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,528
AT THIS TIME, OFFICIALS HAVE 

479
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:01,833
STOPPED RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY 

480
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:02,201
CALLS. 

481
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,102
I THINK EMERGENCY WORKERS 

482
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,937
ALWAYS WANT TO GET OUT AND HELP 

483
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:05,404
SOMEONE IF THEY CAN. 

484
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,672
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO PUT 

485
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,740
THEMSELVES IN DANGER, SO YOU 

486
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,675
ARE NOT SEEING THEM RESPOND AT 

487
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:09,975
THIS HOUR. 

488
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:10,843
IN TERMS OF OUR LOCATION, IT 

489
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,079
DID GET VERY BAD FOR THE WIND 

490
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,614
STARTED TO PICK UP ABOUT AN 

491
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,183
HOUR, HOUR AND A HALF AGO. 

492
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,351
AS I MENTIONED, THE LIGHTS HAVE 

493
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,185
BEEN FLICKERING ON AND OFF, 

494
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,821
WHICH IS TYPICAL IN A HURRICANE 

495
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,121
LIKE THIS. 

496
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:28,927
WE LOST POWER FOR GOOD A LITTLE 

497
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,796
MORE THAN A HALF HOUR AGO OR IT 

498
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,697
HAS NOT COME BACK ON. 

499
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,433
SO WE ARE ON GENERATOR POWER AT 

500
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:34,733
THIS TIME. 

501
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,768
OBVIOUSLY, THING TO WATCH OUT 

502
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,869
FOR IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, 

503
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,105
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SLIGHTLY 

504
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:40,873
SHIELDED HERE, FOR ANYBODY OUT 

505
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,974
AND ABOUT, WATCH FOR 

506
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,942
PROJECTIS, WHICH CAN DO SOME 

507
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,242
OF THE WORST DAMAGE. 

508
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:44,976
OF COURSE, WHAT OFFICIALS 

509
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:48,480
REALLY CAUTION OF, THE WIND IS 

510
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,780
HORRENDOUS. 

511
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,982
FAR WORSE THAN A LOT OF FOLKS 

512
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:50,249
EXPECTED. 

513
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,686
KEEP IN MIND, THIS WENT FROM A 

514
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,654
TROPICAL STORM TO WHAT I 

515
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,091
BELIEVE IS ALMOST A CATEGORY 5 

516
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:04,896
STORM IN ABOUT 72 HOURS OR SO. 

517
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,166
SO AS -- LONNIE CAN TALK MORE 

518
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:07,466
ABOUT THAT. 

519
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,201
AS BAD AS THE WINDS ARE, AS HE 

520
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,569
KNOWS AS WELL, ONE OF THE BIG 

521
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,439
CONCERNS AS IT WAS DURING 

522
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,540
HURRICANE FLORENCE AND EVERY 

523
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,174
OTHER HURRICANE IS PEOPLE 

524
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,074
DRIVING IN THESE CONDITIONS. 

525
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:18,444
WHEN THE FLASH FLOODS HAPPEN, 

526
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,644
15 OR 10 INCHES OF RAIN FALLS 

527
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,213
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND 

528
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,247
THE ROAD FILLED UP AND SOMEBODY 

529
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,085
TRIES TO DRIVE THROUGH IT, NOT 

530
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,986
A GOOD IDEA. 

531
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,321
>> NOBODY SHOULD BE ON THE 

532
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:29,521
ROAD. 

533
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,121
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. 

534
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:30,989
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT 

535
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:36,328
EVERY HURRICANE IS DIFFERENT. 

536
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,830
WE REMEMBER YOU WITH HURRICANE 

537
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,096
FLORENCE. 

538
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:38,864
BACK THEN IT WAS REALLY ALL 

539
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:39,331
ABOUT THE RAIN. 

540
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,132
NOW JEFF IS MENTIONING ALL 

541
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:40,966
ABOUT THE WIND. 

542
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,167
WE ARE GOING TO PORT SAINT JOE, 

543
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:42,434
FLORIDA. 

544
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,769
ALSO EXPERIENCING HEAVY WIND 

545
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,002
GUSTS. 

546
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:46,838
HOW ARE THE CONDITIONS THERE? 

547
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:52,978
>> Reporter: THEY ARE NOT GOOD 

548
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,048
AT ALL. IN THE LAST HALF HOUR, 

549
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,216
WE HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY STOUT 

550
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:57,849
GUSTS AROUND HERE. 

551
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,218
ANOTHER THING WE ARE SEEING IS 

552
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,052
PIECES OF BUILDINGS ARE 

553
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,386
STARTING TO FLY OFF. 

554
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:02,754
WE ARE KIND OF GARDEN RIGHT 

555
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,021
HERE FROM A HOTEL, BUT WE ARE 

556
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:06,090
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 

557
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,358
NOT GOING TO BE IN THE PATH OF 

558
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:07,692
PROJECTILES. 

559
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,060
WE HAVE SEEN A FEW TREES SNAP 

560
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,861
IN HALF AND FALL DOWN. 

561
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:12,231
THIS WHOLE AREA HERE IS WITHOUT 

562
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:12,464
POWER. 

563
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,265
STORM SURGE, OBVIOUSLY, IS A 

564
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:13,531
BIG DEAL. 

565
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:20,339
THAT'S THE BIG KILLER AND 

566
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:20,638
HURRICANES. 

567
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:21,839
JUST IN A MATTER OF MINUTES, WE 

568
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,275
SAW A FEW INCHES TURN TO MORE 

569
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,576
THAN A FOOT AND A HALF. 

570
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,577
SO THAT STORM SURGE IS COMING. 

571
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,146
SOME OF THE BEACHES HERE IN 

572
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,880
PORT SAINT JOE HAD A VERY 

573
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,215
SHALLOW BEACH, NOT A BUNCH OF 

574
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:30,549
BUFFER AREA. 

575
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,650
AS SOON AS MICHAEL IS COMING 

576
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,387
CLOSER AND CLOSES, THE -- 

577
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,421
CLOSER, THE BEACHES WERE 

578
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:36,754
SWALLOWED UP. 

579
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:37,856
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WIND. 

580
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,792
THE TREES AND SHRUBBERY, IT 

581
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,194
SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE WAVING 

582
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:42,494
BEHIND ME. 

583
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,328
IT'S NOT JUST COMING ONE WAY. 

584
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,597
THESE WIND GUSTS ARE SWIRLING 

585
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,431
ALL OVER CAUSING A LOT OF 

586
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:46,664
HAVOC. 

587
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,067
THE GOOD THING IS WE HAVE NOT 

588
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,469
SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE 

589
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:50,702
ROADS. 

590
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,603
THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES MAKING 

591
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,070
SURE PEOPLE ARE OKAY. 

592
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,474
PEOPLE HERE ARE HEEDING THE 

593
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,842
WARNINGS OR THE DEPUTIES ARE 

594
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,143
DOING MINOR CRUISES WHERE THEY 

595
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:58,743
CAN DRIVE, BECAUSE THEY ARE 

596
00:17:58,743 --> 00:17:59,311
ALSO HUNKERING DOWN. 

597
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,379
THE HOSPITAL IS CLOSED, THE 

598
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:06,952
AMBULANCE ARE FURTHER INLAND, 

599
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,720
AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF THE 

600
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,320
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS TOLD ME 

601
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,789

602
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,024

ABLE TO GET TO YOU TILL AFTER 

604
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:13,792

605
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,426
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR 

606
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,426
WHAT'S GOING ON AND LET YOU 

607
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,729

00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,198
>> PLEASE BE SAFE WHILE YOU DO 

609
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:19,398
THAT. 

610
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,499
THOSE TREES SWAYING BEHIND YOU 

611
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,599
MAKE A LOT OF US HERE WATCHING 

612
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,300

HE MAY BE VISITING THE AREA 

626
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:50,829

627
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,464
HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET

HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

654
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,677
HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY 

655
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:44,883
ABOUT THE EVACUATIONS. 

656
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:49,288
>> THEY ARE ALL EITHER 

657
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,255
CONTACTED OR ARE IN THE 

658
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:50,522
PROCESS. 

659
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,325
I HAD A LONG TALK WITH GOVERNOR 

660
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,128
SCOTT OF FLORIDA. 

661
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,162
VERY WELL COORDINATED WITH ALL 

662
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:57,529
OF THE STATES. 

663
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,930
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS 

664
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,232
THAT MUST BE SAID IS IT'S NOT 

665
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,200
SO EASY FOR SOME OF THESE 

666
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,235
PEOPLE TO LEAVE. 

667
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,436
SOME OF THE AREAS ARE VERY 

668
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:04,636
POOR. 

669
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,171
NOT EASY FOR A PERSON WITHOUT 

670
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,005
THE NECESSARY MONEY TO LEAVE. 

671
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,474
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS SENT 

672
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:09,707
BUSES. 

673
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:14,680
WE SPENT A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- 

674
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,048
WE ARE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT 

675
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,316
THINGS TO TRY TO REMOVE PEOPLE 

676
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,251
FROM THE AREA, BUT A LOT OF 

677
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,185
PEOPLE ARE VERY POOR IN CERTAIN 

678
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,386
OF THOSE AREAS, AND IT'S TOUGH 

679
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,120
FOR THEM TO LEAVE. 

680
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,555
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU 

681
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,356
ARE FINDING I GUESS. 

682
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,057
>> IN SOME CASES, YOU KNOW, 

683
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,860
WHAT WE ASKED TO DO ON BLUE SKY 

684
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,429
DAYS IS AS PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT 

685
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,630
HAVE THE MEANS OR MECHANISMS TO 

686
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,099
GET OUT OF TOWN TO REGISTER 

687
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:38,537
WITH THE LOCAL EMERGENCY 

688
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,004
MANAGEMENT AGENCIES. 

689
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:39,838
FLORIDA HAS BEEN PRETTY ROBUST. 

690
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,206
WE HAVE SOME IDEA HOW TO PLAN 

691
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:41,506
FOR THAT. 

692
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,674
WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT 

693
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,577
THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. 

694
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:47,979
WHEN IT COMES TO GEORGIA, YOU 

695
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,014
KNOW, WE ARE NOT EVACUATING 

696
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:49,814
FOUR STORM SURGE IN GEORGIA. 

697
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:51,382
THIS IS HIGH WINDS. 

698
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,984
SO WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET 

699
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,186
WITHIN A FACILITY THAT CAN 

700
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,789
WITHSTAND THE WINDS AND TRY TO 

701
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,957
SHELTER IN PLACE OR SEEK OUT 

702
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,158
PUBLIC SHELTERS THAT MAY BE 

703
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,059
OPEN IN SOUTHWEST GEORGIA. 

704
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,595
>> LOOK AT THE SIZE, HOW LONG 

705
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:03,828
IT IS. 

706
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,164
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND THE RED 

707
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,099
AREA, BASICALLY, IS THE AREA 

708
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,534
IT'S GOING TO HIT PRETTY 

709
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:09,801
HEAVILY. 

710
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,402
THAT'S A LOT OF SURE. 

711
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:15,640
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND. 

712
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,109
>> STORM SURGE ALL THE WAY DOWN 

713
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,243
TO TAMPA BAY, WHICH IS VERY LOW-

714
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,948
LYING AND FLOODS VERY EASILY. 

715
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,349
TO GIVE YOU THAT IDEA OF THE 

716
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,283
BREADTH OF ITS PAST, IT IS 

717
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:25,650
QUITE LARGE. 

718
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,751
>> IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE 

719
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:27,419
OF THE GULF. 

720
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,054
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TOPICALLY, 

721
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,021
IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE, 

722
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:33,558
AND THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THAT -- 

723
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,493
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT AT 

724
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,327
ALL. 

725
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:43,201
NOBODY SEEN THAT BEFORE. 

726
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,503
>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 

727
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,370
MONITORING HURRICANE MICHAEL AS 

728
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:45,803
IT MAKES LANDFALL. 

729
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:46,437
THOSE DAMAGING WINDS AT 150 

730
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:47,072
MILES PER HOUR. 

731
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,106
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE. 

732
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:48,473
STAY WITH US.

STRUGGLING TO RECOVER, AND MANY 

740

ARE WONDERING IF IT EVER WILL. 

741
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:04,943
PUERTO RICO IS IN THE THROES OF 

742
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,944
AN EXODUS THAT DRAINED THE

NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT HAVE 

747

EARLIER PRESIDENT TRUMP 

803

HIS WIFE WROTE US A LETTER AND 

809
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,581
ADDRESSED IT TO MY WIFE AND 

810
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,348

812
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,423
BRING HER TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 

813
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,390
IT'S A VERY SAD SITUATION. 

814
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,758
IT'S A VERY BAD SITUATION, AND 

815
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:38,797
WE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF 

816
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:38,963
IT. 

817
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:39,664
>> [ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ] 

818
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,299
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT. 

819
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,371
I HOPE HE IS NOT. 

820
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,340
>> [ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ] 

821
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,975
>> I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO DID 

822
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:51,141
IT. 

823
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:53,011
PEOPLE SAW HIM GO IN BUT THEY 

824
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,212
DID NOT SEE THEM COME OUT, AS I 

825
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:54,579
UNDERSTAND IT. 

826
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,714
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY 

827
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,347
SERIOUS LOOK AT IT. 

828
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:57,048
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. 

829
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,049
>> WE ARE ALSO FOUND EXPLOSIVE 

830
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,382
NEW DETAILS. 

831
00:26:58,382 --> 00:26:59,317
THE TRICK IS NEWS CHANNEL HAS 

832
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,385
RELEASED THE PICTURES OF WHAT 

833
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,219
THEY ARE CALLING THE HIT SQUAD 

834
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:06,223
ARRIVING IN TURKEY TO KILL. 

835
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:07,192
THE SQUAD REPORTEDLY ENTERED 

836
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,025
AND LEFT THE CONSULATE WHERE HE 

837
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:08,593
WAS LAST SEEN. 

838
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,330
JOINING THE ONSET MUSTAFA, A 

839
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:17,201
FELLOW AT THE INSTITUTE. 

840
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,269
IF IT IS DEFINITIVE THAT SAUDI 

841
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,172
ARABIA WAS BEHIND THIS 

842
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:21,940
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, WHAT 

843
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,307
ROLE SHOULD THE U.S. BE PLAYING 

844
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:26,511
NOW AND IF THAT IS CONFIRMED? 

845
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,345
>> WELL, I'M GLAD THAT 

846
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,246
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE ABOUT 

847
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:28,446
THIS. 

848
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,614
THE U.S. SHOULD WAIT ON THIS. 

849
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:37,355
THEY SHOULD NOT JUST BUY INTO IT

850
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,390
, FIRST OF ALL. 

851
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,290
THEY ARE SAYING WE DON'T KNOW 

852
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,291
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. 

853
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,426
HE CAME IN AND HE CAME OUT. 

854
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,794
THAT'S NOT CREDIBLE. 

855
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:44,428
HIS FIANCC WAS WAITING. 

856
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:45,096
HE NEVER CAME OUT. 

857
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,097
I THINK THE TURKISH POLICE 

858
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,065
RIGHT NOW HAVE A LOT OF 

859
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,767
CRIMINAL EVIDENCE SHOWING THE 

860
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,467
SPECIAL TEAM FROM SAUDI ARABIA 

861
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,334
CAME BECAUSE THEY KNEW HE WAS 

862
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,837
COMING THAT DAY. 

863
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,172
HE CAME THERE FOUR DAYS AGO TO 

864
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:59,210
GET THE PAPERS. 

865
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,945
SO I HIT SQUAD, AS YOU SAID. 

866
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:01,746
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE 

867
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,179
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. 

868
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:03,481
WE KNOW THAT FROM THE EVIDENCE. 

869
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,250
SO THEY CAME TO KILL OR CAPTURE 

870
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,784
HIM SOMEHOW, BUT HIS FACE IS 

871
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:14,092
WITH THE GOVERNMENT. 

872
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,193
THEY WERE CAUGHT RED-HANDED, I 

873
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:15,727
THINK IN THIS CASE. 

874
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,961
>> THE FRONT PAGE OF A 

875
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,932
PROMINENT TURKISH NEWSPAPER HAD 

876
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:21,265
THEIR IMAGES. 

877
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:22,267
THAT FULL SCREEN SHOWING ALL 15 

878
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,401
OF THE PEOPLE THEY BELIEVED 

879
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,134
WERE, IN FACT, INVOLVED. 

880
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:26,437
DO WE HAVE THAT IMAGE? 

881
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:26,771
RIGHT THERE. 

882
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,039
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THE 

883
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,673
TURKISH AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING 

884
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,241
WERE INVOLVED AS PART OF THE 

885
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:30,575
HIT SQUAD. 

886
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,676
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE 

887
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:31,909
PEOPLE? 

888
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:34,979
>> THEY ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE 

889
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,081
TURKISH POLICE, AND A FEW OF 

890
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,181
THEM ARE ALSO KNOWN AS PEOPLE 

891
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,250
WHO ARE IN THE MILITARY, SO 

892
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:46,257
THEY ARE NOT ANYBODY. EVEN MORE 

893
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,225
IMPORTANT THAN THESE PHOTOS IS 

894
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,193
THE VIDEO FOOTAGE THAT THE 

895
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,427
TURKISH POLICE RELEASE. 

896
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,528
IT SHOWS HIM ENTERING BUT NEVER 

897
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:50,861
GETTING OUT. 

898
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:55,400
IT SHOWS A LITTLE BEFORE HIS 

899
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,401
ENTRANCE THESE GUYS CAME AND 

900
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,869
THERE WAS A BLACK MAN AND A 

901
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,103
BLACK MAN WAS THERE FOR SEVERAL 

902
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:00,004
HOURS AND THEN CAME OUT AND 

903
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:00,772
WENT TO THE RESIDENCE. 

904
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,140
I THINK EVERYTHING IS SEEN IN 

905
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:08,580
THAT FOOTAGE THAT HE WAS 

906
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:08,846
CAPTURED. 

907
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:09,914
ALSO, THE PEOPLE AT THE 

908
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:15,820
EMBASSY, THE TURKISH PEOPLE, 

909
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,821
THE LOCALS SAY, TAKE THIS 

910
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:17,188
AFTERNOON OFF. 

911
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:17,822
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT MEETING 

912
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:18,055
TODAY. 

913
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:18,556
THAT'S ALL SUSPICIOUS. 

914
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,193
I THINK THE ONLY THING WE DON'T 

915
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,863
KNOW IS WHETHER THEY KILLED 

916
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:25,530
THEM ALREADY OR SOMEHOW THEY 

917
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:25,963
TOOK HIM ALIVE. 

918
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,265
THAT'S STILL UNCLEAR BUT IT'S 

919
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,234
POSSIBLE THEY MAY HAVE KILLED 

920
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:29,434
HIM. 

921
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:35,373
THE TURKISH POLICE THINK HIS 

922
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,341
BODY WAS THE NUMBERS INTO 

923
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,475
PIECES TO BE TAKEN AWAY IN 

924
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,042
BOXES OR BURIED. 

925
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,043
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 

926
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:39,644
TRUMP WEIGHING IN. 

927
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,212
HE WANTS FIANCC TO COME TO THE 

928
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:41,545
WHITE HOUSE. 

929
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:43,982
WHY HAVE WE HEARD FROM THE 

930
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:44,315
WORLD? 

931
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,416
HOW DID EMIRATES CUSTOMER SITE 

932
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,250
NO ONE ELSE WEIGH IN ON THIS? 

933
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,088
>> MOST COUNTRIES ARE NOT GREAT 

934
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,923
ON YOU SHOULD SAY THAT. 

935
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:53,925
ALSO A PLACE YOU HAVE 

936
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,661
MENTIONED, THEY ARE ALLIES. 

937
00:29:57,661 --> 00:30:03,701
EACH OF GOING AFTER CRITICS. 

938
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,636
HONESTLY, THEY ARE NOT AS 

939
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:04,903
FREEDOM. 

940
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,205
THIS IS TOO WILD FOR TURKISH 

941
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:08,506
STANDARDS. 

942
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:17,248
I THINK ON THE TURKEY IS ON THE 

943
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:23,254
RIGHT-SIDE. 

944
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,355
WHILE YOU CAN EXPECT DICTATORS 

945
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,523
OF ADDICTION TO COME OUT AND 

946
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,591
SPEAK FOR FREE SPEECH, WE 

947
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,659
EXPECT THAT FROM FREE COUNTRY 

948
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,827
IN IT SINCE I THINK U.S. 

949
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:34,632
LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD WHICH 

950
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,700
HAS THE I THINK IS STILL 

951
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,000
IMPORTANT. 

952
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,834
I THINK THE U.S. SHOULD COMES 

953
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,302
IN BLACK AND KATE SAY, WE TALK 

954
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:42,240
TO THEM, THEY SAID THEY DON'T 

955
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,507
KNOW. 

956
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,641
>> GAVE WOMEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

957
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:43,874
DRIVE. 

958
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:46,744
EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT WAS 

959
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,011
AMAZING. 

960
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:53,251
HE HAS TAKEN LEBANESE PRIME 

961
00:30:53,251 --> 00:31:06,998
MINISTER, BUT IT WILL. SAUDI 

962
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:07,765
ARABIA, KEPT HIM THERE. 

963
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,200
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR HIM WHO 

964
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,334
WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIS IMAGE 

965
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:10,501
OF? 

966
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,869
>> FRUSTRATING FOR MUSLIMS LIKE 

967
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:12,102
MYSELF. 

968
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:12,302
YOU? 

969
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:12,736
UNFORTUNATELY, YES. 

970
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:16,507
SOME GOOD REFORMS TOOK PLACE IN 

971
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:16,840
SUDI ARABIA. 

972
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,742
BUT I THINK PEOPLE LIKE 

973
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:22,080
MOHAMMED ARE DOING THESE THINGS 

974
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,682
TO GET BROWNIE POINTS IN THE 

975
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:25,316
WEST AND THEN USE THAT 

976
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,016
AUTHORITY AND THAT POPULARITY 

977
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:32,523
TO CRACK DOWN ON THIS AND 

978
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:32,890
BECOME RULERS. 

979
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,025
IT'S A VERY BRUTAL REGIME, MORE 

980
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,226
BRUTAL THAN WHAT WAS THERE. 

981
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,562
THEY SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH 

982
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,997
THIS, AND I THINK THE FREE ONE 

983
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,332
-- FREE WORLD SHOULD CELEBRATE 

984
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,266
THE FACT THAT WOMEN DRIVE, BUT 

985
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:47,205
THE FACT THAT CRITICS ARE BEING 

986
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,639
KILLED IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 

987
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:49,039
CAN BE TOLERATED. 

988
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,375
>> GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US 

989
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:50,808
TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 

990
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,910
APPRECIATE IT. 

991
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,277
>> MY PLEASURE. 

992
00:31:52,277 --> 00:32:00,585
>>> WE TURN TO MORE ON 

993
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,988
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

994
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,089
>> THAT TELLS ME THE STORM IS 

995
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:05,756
RIGHT IN HERE. 

996
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:06,557
THAT'S WHERE THE CENTER IS. 

997
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,093
NOTICE PANAMA CITY, 46 MILE-PER-

998
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:09,460
HOUR WINDS. 

999
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,860
APALACHICOLA, 58. 

1000
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,661
THE WIND ON THE EASTERN SIDE, 

1001
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:17,301
THEY ARE STRONGER. 

1002
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:18,202
SO AREAS LIKE MARIANNA AND 

1003
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,170
DALTON, WHERE THE STORM GOES 

1004
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,171
RIGHT NEARBY, PROBABLY FINDS 

1005
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,271
WEAKER WINDS THEN WE WILL SEE 

1006
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:22,172
IN SOME AREAS NEAR BAINBRIDGE. 

1007
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:25,209
WE WILL SEE WINS OVER 60 MILES 

1008
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:25,576
PER HOUR. 

1009
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,844
BUT THAT IS LIKELY ALL, EVEN IF 

1010
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,247
THE CORE HAS STRONGER WINDS. 

1011
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,214
THEY HAVE THE TRANSLATE DOWN 

1012
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:30,681
FROM THE SURFACE. 

1013
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:34,419
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO 

1014
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:34,852
BE THE CASE. 

1015
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,954
FURTHER REMOVED FROM THE GULF 

1016
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,954
WATERS, IT WILL LOSE INTENSITY 

1017
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:42,259
AND LIKELY IN A HURRY. 

1018
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,262
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK. 

1019
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,496
BACK TO THE NEWS DESK IN JUST A 

1020
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:45,729
SECOND. 

1021
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:46,998
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE EXTENDED 

1022
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:47,265
FORECAST. 

1023
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,399
ALL WE TALK ABOUT IS MICHAEL, 

1024
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:49,800
MICHAEL, MICHAEL. 

1025
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,968
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE 

1026
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,170
LOOKING AT INTO THE UPCOMING 

1027
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,436
WEEKEND. 

1028
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:53,170
SOME ACTUAL FALL LIKE WEATHER, 

1029
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:53,371
GUYS. 

1030
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,439
THAT WILL MAKE THIS ALL SEEM A 

1031
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,173
WHOLE LOT BETTER. 

1032
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:59,043
>> PRETTY INCREDIBLE THERE, AS 

1033
00:32:59,043 --> 00:32:59,310
HE SAID. 

1034
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,249
THE STORM HAS OFFICIALLY MADE 

1035
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,919
LANDFALL AND THERE'S A LOT OF 

1036
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,953
FOLKS IN OUR AREA RIGHT NOW 

1037
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,154
THAT THEY ARE SO GLAD THEY HAD 

1038
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,122
GOTTEN OUT OF THOSE EVACUATION 

1039
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:11,855
AREAS AND INTO THOSE SHELTERS. 

1040
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:17,361
>> IN LEON COUNTY, HIGH SCHOOL 

1041
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:23,201
SERVING AS SHELTERS. 

1042
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:23,767
ABBY WALDEN IS THERE. 

1043
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:24,969
>> Reporter: A LITTLE HARD TO 

1044
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:25,770
HEAR, AS YOU CAN TELL. 

1045
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,939
I AM IN THE PET SIDE. 

1046
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,040
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS PEOPLE WILL 

1047
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,842
COME IN WITH THEIR PETS AND 

1048
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,710
THEY WILL BE USHERED TO A 

1049
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,143
SEPARATE BUILDING. 

1050
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:36,747
THEY WILL REGISTERED WITH THE 

1051
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:37,715
HUMANE SOCIETY, LEAVE THEIR 

1052
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,383
PETS HERE, AND IF THEY NEED TO 

1053
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,785
BE WALKED AND THAT SORT OF 

1054
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,186
THING, THEY CAN COME AND DO 

1055
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,821
THAT AS WELL. 

1056
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,689
ANIMALS DEFINITELY FEELING THE 

1057
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,090
EFFECTS OF HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

1058
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,158
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT NOT ONLY 

1059
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:51,796
ARE THERE DOGS AND CATS HERE, 

1060
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:52,897
BUT THERE ARE ALSO PARROTS, 

1061
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:53,731
AFFAIR, AND EVEN APPEARED. 

1062
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,632
LOTS OF PEOPLE TAKING THE 

1063
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,366
WARNING, BRINGING THEIR PETS 

1064
00:33:55,366 --> 00:34:01,072
HERE SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN STAY 

1065
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,173
SAFE. 

1066
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,475
>> THAT WAS PRETTY HARD TO 

1067
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,543
HEAR, BUT PEOPLE BRING THEIR 

1068
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:05,743
PETS. 

1069
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,611
PETS ARE MEMBERS OF THEIR 

1070
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,544
FAMILY, SO THEY WANT EVERYONE 

1071
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:08,011
TO BE SAFE. 

1072
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:14,085
>> THAT SOUNDED LIKE 1001 

1073
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:20,958
DONATIONS -- DALMATIANS. 

1074
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:21,891
>> Reporter: THE LIGHT INSIDE 

1075
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:26,197
OF THE GYMNASIUM WENT OUT A 

1076
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:26,929
LITTLE AFTER 12:30. 

1077
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,065
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE STARTLED, 

1078
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:32,837
BUT NOT FRANTIC. 

1079
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,905
EVERYONE IS ROLLING WITH THE 

1080
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,005
FLOW, AND THE LIGHTS ARE STILL 

1081
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:39,743
ON IN THIS PART OF THE GYM. 

1082
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:40,678
THIS IS THE LOBBY AREA. 

1083
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,779
OF COURSE, OUTSIDE THERE'S A 

1084
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,282
LOT OF PEOPLE HANGING OUT 

1085
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,149
OUTSIDE, BUT THERE ARE ABOUT 

1086
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:50,188
278 PEOPLE SIGNED UP AT THE

00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:50,521
SHELTER HERE. 

1088
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,289
THAT WAS AS OF NOON. 

1089
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,357
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKING 

1090
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,058
ADVANTAGE OF IT. 

1091
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,525
THEY ARE WORKING ON THE LIGHTS 

1092
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,528
SITUATION INSIDE THE GYM. 

1093
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,996
IT SHOULD BE UP PRETTY SOON, 

1094
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:03,935
BUT EVERYONE IS DOING WELL. 

1095
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,236
THEY ARE DOING OKAY, NOT UPSET 

1096
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:05,603
ABOUT ANYTHING. 

1097
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,704
THEY ARE JUST GOING WITH IT. 

1098
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,074
THEY ARE JUST GLAD TO BE HERE. 

1099
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,842

IT MADE LANDFALL. 

1170
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,632
PRESSURED 919 MILLIBARS. WINDS 

1171
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,069

1172
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,138
WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. 

1173
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,606
YOU CAN SEE THAT I WON'T MAKE 

1174
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,640
AND ON LANDFALL. 

1175
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,176
THE WIND WARNING IS ISSUED. 

1176
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,311
THAT MEANS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS 

1177
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:43,981
SITUATIONS WITH THAT WIND. 

1178
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,450
WE ALSO GOT A LOOK AT THE 

1179
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,384
DIFFERENT AREAS AS WELL. 

1180
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:49,420

1182
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,791
GUSTS WITH THAT AS WELL. 

1183
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,293
IS NOT JUST THE CENTER. IT IS 

1184
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,461
WELL UP FROM THE CENTER. 

1185
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,529
SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO 

1186
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,600
MENTION, IF YOU DIDN'T LEAVE 

1187
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,801
AND THIS EYE COMES THROUGH, IT 

1188
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,703
COULD MOMENTARILY GET CALM. 

1189
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,570
REMEMBER, YOU HAVE THE OTHER 

1190
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,605
SIDE COMING THROUGH. 

1191
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:07,938
STAY SAFE. 

1192
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:08,539

1193
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,306

00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:13,477
WHERE IS IT GOING? 

1196
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,613
LOOK AT THE SIZE AND THE SYSTEM.

1197
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,314
LOOK AT THESE WINDS EXTENDING 

1198
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:21,352
175 MILES AWAY FROM THE CENTER 

1199
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,953
AND EVEN AROUND THE CENTER. 

1200
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,756
WE REALLY NEED TO NOT FOCUS ON 

1201
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,223
THAT CENTER. 

1202
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,993
YOU NEED TO THINK OF THIS IS 

1203
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,896
ALARM -- LARGE STORM. 

1204
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,298
POWER OUTAGES BECAUSE OF THESE 

1205
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,934
WINDS THAT COULD LAST SEVERAL 

1206
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,167
WEEKS. 

1207
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:42,172
IT IS A SERIOUS SITUATION. NOT 

1208
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:43,541
JUST THE COAST. 

1209
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,511
WE STILL EXPECT TRY NINE ON THAT

LINE. 

1212
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,252
IF YOU TAKE THE RAIN AND YOU 

1213
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,954
TAKE THOSE WINDS, YOU CAN HAVE 

1214
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,823
POWER OUTAGES AND TREES DOWN 

1215
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:02,760
THROUGH GEORGIA AND PORTIONS OF 

1216
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,228
SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND ALSO INTO 

1217
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:04,595
THE CAROLINAS. 

1218
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,096
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT RAIN, YOU 

1219
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:10,000
CAN SEE ELANA FLASH FLOODING. 

1220
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,935
IT'S A SERIOUS SITUATION. 

1221
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:12,870
ANYTIME YOU OF THESE TROPICAL 

1222
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,038
SYSTEMS COME IN, SIX TO 10 

1223
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,374
INCHES OF RAIN UP INTO PORTIONS 

1224
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,510
OF SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND EVEN 

1225
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,511
INTO GEORGIA. 

1226
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,413
LOOK AT THIS LARGE AREA FOUR TO 

1227
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:29,320
SIX INCHES. 

1228
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,654
THAT'S WHERE YOU WILL HAVE SOME 

1229
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,789
OF THE WINDS IN SATURATED SOIL. 

1230
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,623
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS EVEN 

1231
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:32,857
INLAND. 

1232
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:33,858
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE 

1233
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,825
STORM -- STORM SURGE. 

1234
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,826
IT LOOKS LIKE WE ALREADY HAVE 

1235
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:40,898
7.4 FEET INUNDATION IN 

1236
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:41,231

EVEN THOUGH THE SYSTEM  IS 

1238
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,137

1239
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,639
ONSHORE FLOW PUSHING THAT WATER 

1240
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:48,805
IN. 

1241
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:49,707
JUST BECAUSE THE STORM IS 

1242
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,674

1245

WE CONTINUE TO FORECAST NINE TO 

1246
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,948
14 FEET. 

1247
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:58,549
THINK ABOUT THAT. 

1248
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:02,086
THAT IS NINE FEET TO 14 FEET 

1249
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:02,786
ABOVE GROUND. 

1250
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:07,324

1251
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,792
YOU CAN SEE THIS WATER COME IN. 

1252
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,960
ON TOP, YOU STILL HAVE THE 

1253
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,861
DAMAGING WAVES THAT CAN CAUSE 

1254
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,129

WELL AWAY FROM THE CENTER, YOU 

1258
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,268
ARE STILL NOT SAFE. 

1259
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:20,937
YOU CAN SEE ELEVATED VALUES ALL 

1260
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:25,876
THE WAY TO CEDAR KEY AND EVEN 

1261
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,211
AS FAR AS TAMPA, TWO TO FOUR 

1262

FEET. 

1263
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,445
THAT IS NOT JUST THE COAST. 

1264
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,947
YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THIS GOES

THE WIND AND THE RAIN PICK UP 

1281
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,643
IN INTENSITY. 

1282
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,677
ONE THING WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING 

1283
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:03,313
IS THIS AUTOBODY SHOP HERE RAIN 

1284
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:03,881
ACROSS THE WAY. 

1285
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,117
ALREADY WE HAVE SEEN PARTS OF 

1286
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:14,191
THE ROOF, OFF. YOU CAN SEE IT 

1287
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:19,730
LOOKS LIKE -- I JUST GOT HIT 

1288
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,566
WITH A BIG GUST OF WIND THERE. 

1289
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,767
OF COURSE, WE ARE KEEPING AN 

1290
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,835
EYE ON THE POWER LINES. 

1291
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,770
YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE SOME THESE 

1292
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,971
STORIES SWING BEHIND ME AND 

1293
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:30,107
SOME OF THE BRANCHES ARE PRETTY 

1294
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:30,708
LOOSE. 

1295
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,508
FORECASTERS ARE WARNING THAT 

1296
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:32,843
THE DAMAGE WE COULD SEE FROM 

1297
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:33,844
THE STORM BEING A CATEGORY FOUR 

1298
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,147
COULD BE CATASTROPHIC. 

1299
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,684
>> I KNOW YOU ARE BRAVING THE 

1300
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,952
ELEMENTS NOW BUT HOW ARE YOU 

1301
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,353
AND THE CREW STAYING SAFE IN 

1302
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:44,421
SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 

1303
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,391
>> Reporter: WELL, WE WERE ON 

1304
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,094
THE BEACH JUST YESTERDAY. 

1305
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,061
OF COURSE, THINGS HAVE CHANGED 

1306
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,397
OUT THERE AS WELL. 

1307
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,665
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE HUNKERED 

1308
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,632
DOWN OUTSIDE OF A HOTEL. 

1309
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:56,867
AND WE ARE TRYING TO SHIELD 

1310
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,070
OURSELVES AS BEST AS WE CAN. 

1311
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,472
EVEN WITH THE HOTEL, WE HAVE 

1312
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,073
SEEN PIECES OF THE ROOF, OFF -- 

1313
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,543
ROOF COME OFF OF THE HOTEL. 

1314
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:10,614
WE ARE TRYING TO BE AS SAFE AS 

1315
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,282
WE CAN. 

1316
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,851
>> I SEE YOUR PRODUCER TRYING 

1317
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:14,918
TO HELP YOU. 

1318
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:15,853
I KNOW IT LOOKS PRETTY 

1319
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,054
DANGEROUS OUT THERE. 

1320
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,123
I HOPE YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF 

1321
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:22,459
YOURSELF AND GET IN THERE. 

1322
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,597
THAT IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. 

1323
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:27,965
BEFORE YOU GO THOUGH, CAN YOU 

1324
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:28,632
TELL US WHAT OFFICIALS ARE 

1325
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,833
SAYING ABOUT THIS? 

1326
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,803
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU KNOW, 

1327
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,005
OBVIOUSLY WE DID TALK TO SOME 

1328
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,673
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, ACTUALLY THE 

1329
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:39,176
POLICE CHIEF FOR PANAMA CITY 

1330
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,447
BEACH . I WAS ASKING HIM ABOUT 

1331
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:44,047
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD EVACUATED 

1332
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:45,215
BECAUSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE 

1333
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,284
REALLY CONCERNED -- I HAVE TO 

1334
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,919
GET ON THE WAY FOR THE SECOND. 

1335
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,921
>> THIS IS CRAZY. 

1336
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,456
>> Reporter: I WILL KIND OF 

1337
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,490
TALK THROUGH THIS. 

1338
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,892
THE LOCAL CHIEF TOLD ME ABOUT 

1339
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,895
50% OF PEOPLE EVACUATED ONCE 

1340
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:58,929
THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE STRENGTH 

1341
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,030
OF THE STORM. 

1342
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,198
THAT WAS WHEN THEY FOUND OUT 

1343
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,800
THERE WAS A CATEGORY TWO PARK 

1344
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,005
-- TWO. 

1345
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,440
THAT REALLY IS THE CONCERN NOT 

1346
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,577
ONLY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT 

1347
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,244
THE GOVERNOR. 

1348
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,212
WE HEARD HIM SAY EARLIER TO 

1349
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,214
DATE THAT HE IS SCARED TO DEATH 

1350
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:17,847
FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO 

1351
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:19,750
WERE ON BARRIER ISLAND REFUSED 

1352
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,084
TO EVACUATE. 

1353
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:24,488
>> YES. 

1354
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,290
BEFORE YOU GO, DO YOU KNOW 

1355
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:26,790
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO 

1356
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,090
EVACUATED? 

1357
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:27,758
DO OFFICIALS FEEL ENOUGH 

1358
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,359
EVACUATED AND DID THEY GET THE 

1359
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,128
HELP THEY NEEDED? 

1360
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,330
>> Reporter: WHAT WE DO KNOW, 

1361
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,698
AT LEAST YOUR LOCALLY IN PANAMA 

1362
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,934
CITY BEACH,  THE CHIEF SAID 

1363
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,336
THERE ARE NO TOURISTS HERE AND 

1364
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:44,041
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WENT HOME. 

1365
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,642
IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE 

1366
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:46,977
IN THE AREA, HE DIDN'T GIVE ME 

1367
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,511
A SENSE AS TO WHERE THEY WENT 

1368
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:49,646
BUT THEY DO HAVE SHELTERS THAT 

1369
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,747
ARE SET UP IN THE AREA. 

1370
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:51,682
THEY WERE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE 

1371
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,184
WERE STILL TRYING TO RIDE THIS 

1372
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:58,188
OUT AT HOME TO AT LEAST GET TO 

1373
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,122
SHELTER. ULTIMATELY, THEY MADE 

1374
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:02,526
THE CALL IN BAY COUNTY THAT 

1375
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,395
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO SHELTER IN 

1376
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,097
PLACE. 

1377
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,165
SO AT THIS POINT, I WOULD 

1378
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,566
EXPECT MOST PEOPLE ARE WRITING 

1379
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:10,801
OUT THE STORM LIKE WE ARE. 

1380
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,904
-- RIDING OUT THE STORM LIKE WE 

1381
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:14,438
ARE. 

1382
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:14,905
AND CONGRATULATIONS. 

1383
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,540
WHAT A WAY TO START OFF A NEW 

1384
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:16,773
CAREER. 

1385
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,443
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS 

1386
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,477
REPORT. 

1387
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,145
I HOPE YOU CAN GET INSIDE AND 

1388
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:22,445
STAY SAFE. 

1389
00:46:22,445 --> 00:46:26,984
>>> ON THE PHONE WITH US NOW IS 

1390
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:27,217
DAVID. 

1391
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,585
HE IS A REPORTER FROM THE MIAMI 

1392
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:28,952
HERALD. 

1393
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,420
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, 

1394
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:30,653
DAVID? 

1395
00:46:30,653 --> 00:46:33,223
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 

1396
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:37,928
WE ARE IN A PARKING GARAGE. 

1397
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,396
WE HAVE A BUNCH OF 

1398
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,732
PHOTOGRAPHERS HERE AND A FEW 

1399
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:42,199
OTHER PEOPLE. 

1400
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,034
WE ARE JUST WATCHING THE 

1401
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,168
AWESOME POWER OF NATURE 

1402
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:46,503
BASICALLY JUST RUNNING THROUGH 

1403
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:52,042
TREES, THE GUSTS, IT LOOKS LIKE 

1404
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:56,613
AN A PUBLIC -- APOCALYPTIC 

1405
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,983
SCENE OUT HERE. 

1406
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,885
IT IS SORT OF WHAT YOU WOULD 

1407
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:02,485
EXPECT WITH THE CATASTROPHIC 

1408
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:03,453
WIND SPEED OF HURRICANE 

1409
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:03,720
MICHAEL.  

1410
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,191
THE DO YOU GET A SENSE, DAVID, 

1411
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,225
THE PEOPLE EVACUATED OR DID 

1412
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,560
THEY CHOOSE TO HUNKER DOWN? 

1413
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,431
>> I THINK IT WAS BOTH. 

1414
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,532
SURPRISINGLY, I DIDN'T GET A 

1415
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,500
HUGE SENSE OF URGENCY FROM 

1416
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,301
PEOPLE WHEN WE CAME. 

1417
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,670
THIS IS A TOURIST TOWN SO A LOT 

1418
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,572
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE TOURISTS LEFT

1419
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:26,243
BUT WE INTERVIEWED QUITE A FEW 

1420
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,577
PEOPLE WHO DECIDED TO STAY AND 

1421
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:28,946
STAY ON THE BARRIER ISLAND SIDE 

1422
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,279
AND WERE JUST GOING TO HUNKER 

1423
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:35,385
DOWN AND TRY TO WITHSTAND IT. 

1424
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:40,257
SO, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 

1425
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,526
DECIDING TO HANG ON SO THEY CAN 

1426
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:48,332
BE CLOSE TO THEIR PROPERTIES. 

1427
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,399
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

1428
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,434
SITUATION, DAVID, I KNOW COVER 

1429
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,503
THE NEWS FOR THE MIAMI HERALD, 

1430
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:54,237
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 

1431
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,206
PREPARING FOR STORM LIKE THIS, 

1432
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,307
DO YOU FEEL THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

1433
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,074
BOARDED UP AND PROTECTED 

1434
00:47:58,074 --> 00:48:00,143
PROPERTY OR DID IT COME AS A 

1435
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:01,311
SURPRISE TO MANY PEOPLE THAT IT 

1436
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,311
HAPPENED SO QUICKLY? 

1437
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:05,148
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS 

1438
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,417
THAT WE WERE A LITTLE MARVELED 

1439
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,052
AT WHEN WE WERE DRIVING DOWN 

1440
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,354
YESTERDAY AND DRIVING THROUGH 

1441
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,690
PANAMA CITY  AND PANAMA CITY 

1442
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,159
BEACH  WAS HOW FEW PLACES HAD 

1443
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,196
SHUTTERS UP. IT DIDN'T SEEM -- 

1444
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,199
IF YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN SOME OF 

1445
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,333
THE MAIN STRIPS HERE, IT DIDN'T 

1446
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,402
LOOK LIKE IT WAS ANY DIFFERENT 

1447
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,373
THAN ANY OTHER NORMAL NIGHT. 

1448
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:33,343
SO, IT WAS A LITTLE SURREAL. I 

1449
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,513
THINK THAT IT CAUGHT A LOT OF 

1450
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,148
PEOPLE OFF GUARD. 

1451
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,385
THERE WAS A BIG RUN ON GASOLINE 

1452
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,352
BUT THERE WERE STILL SOME 

1453
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,022
PLACES WITH GASOLINE AND SOME 

1454
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,056
PLACES WERE STILL OPEN SELLING 

1455
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,157
A FEW THINGS. 

1456
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:47,824
IT IS WEIRD. 

1457
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:48,692
IT DEFINITELY CREPT UP ON 

1458
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,895

ALTHOUGH THE MAJOR IMPACTS OF

00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:55,993
THE STORM RIGHT NOW ARE 

1495
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,561
HAPPENING ALONG THE COAST, THE 

1496
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:02,199
INLAND AIR AREAS -- AREAS ARE 

1497
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:02,999
ALSO GOING TO GET THOSE 

1498
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,335
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS. 

1499
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,636
WE WON'T BE STANDING BY THOSE 

1500
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,405
TREES IN A FEW HOURS WHEN THAT 

1501
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,005
HURRICANE COMES THROUGH HERE, 

1502
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,341
EXPECTED TO BE IN THE LATE 

1503
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,642
AFTERNOON OR EVENING. 

1504
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,277
SHELTERS ARE OPEN. 

1505
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,846
WE ARE SEEING NOT MANY PEOPLE 

1506
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,182
OUT AND ABOUT. THAT'S A VERY 

1507
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:19,515
GOOD THING. 

1508
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:20,550
AGAIN, THAT WIND IS STARTING TO 

1509
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:20,817
PICK UP. 

1510
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,552
PRETTY SOON IT WILL START TO BE 

1511
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,187
CONSISTENT LIKE WE ARE SEEING 

1512
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,189
FROM COLLEAGUES OUT ALONG THE 

1513
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,325
COAST. 

1514
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,559
>> THE REPORTS WE ARE SEEING 

1515
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,729
AND THE IMAGES WE ARE SEEING 

1516
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:33,229
ARE PRETTY TREMENDOUS. 

1517
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:36,133
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING FOR THE 

1518
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,534
POINT OF IMPACT? 

1519
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,336
WHEN WILL IT REALLY TOUCHDOWN 

1520
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,271
IN TALLAHASSEE? 

1521
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,940

1522
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,308
>> Reporter: WHAT WE ARE

00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,243
HEARING SO FAR, CONDITIONS ARE 

1524
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,678
REALLY GOING TO START TO 

1525
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:49,546
DETERIORATE LATER THIS 

1526
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:49,879
AFTERNOON. 

1527
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,115
WILL GO BACK TO THIS POINT THAT 

1528
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,183
THE BIG CONCERN IS CLEARLY NOT 

1529
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:58,188
GOING TO BE COASTAL FLOODING OR 

1530
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:58,521
STORM SURGE. 

1531
00:50:58,521 --> 00:50:59,489
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS. 

1532
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,991
SO MANY TREES HERE AND ANY OF 

1533
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,160
THEM THAT ARE OLD OR DYING OR 

1534
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,128
SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE THE 

1535
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:10,267
HURRICANE FORCE WIND  S, THOSE 

1536
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,468
ARE EXPECTED TO COME DOWN ON 

1537
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:15,272
HOMES AND BUILDINGS. 

1538
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,239
THERE WANTING TO GET PEOPLE 

1539
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,240
INTO SHELTERS, AWAY FROM THE 

1540
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,506
STORIES. 

1541
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:19,109
ALSO THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO 

1542
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,210
THE POWER OUTAGES THAT ARE 

1543
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,279
EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THIS AREA. 

1544
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,713
IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH LATE 

1545
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,283
AFTERNOON TO EVENING FOR THE 

1546
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,218
TALLAHASSEE AREA AND THAT IT 

1547
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,386
MOVES ON OUT OF HERE. 

1548
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:33,290
THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT 

1549
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,057
DAMAGE IT LEFT BEHIND. 

1550
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,392
WE SHOULD POINT OUT AS FAR AS 

1551
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,560
POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE WINDS 

1552
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,561
START TO GET CONSISTENT AT 

1553
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,930
ABOUT 35 MILES PER HOUR AND WE 

1554
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,233
MAY BE THERE SOON, THAT'S WHEN 

1555
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,202
THE POWER COMPANY SAYS IT IS NO 

1556
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,170
LONGER SAFE TO BE OUT AND ABOUT 

1557
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,038
TRYING TO RESTORE THE POWER 

1558
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:51,174
LINES THAT WERE KNOCKED DOWN 

1559
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:51,608
EARLY ON. 

1560
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,310
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE DOING 

1561
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:53,777
THAT ANYMORE. 

1562
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,978
IT MAY NOT BE UNTIL TOMORROW 

1563
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,280
WHEN THEY GET DAYLIGHT THAT 

1564
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,783
THEY ARE FINALLY ABLE TO START 

1565
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,683
CLEARING TREES AND TRYING TO 

1566
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:01,818
RESTORE POWER. 

1567
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,454
THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES WHEN IT 

1568
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,789
COMES TO RESTORING POWER. 

1569
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,757
THE HOSPITALS, NURSING HOMES, 

1570
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,293
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, 

1571
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,361
THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY WILL 

1572
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,197
TRY TO GET ONLINE FIRST FOR 

1573
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,599
OBVIOUS REASONS. 

1574
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,000
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 

1575
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,668
THE POWER THE MOST AND THE MOST 

1576
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:18,935
QUICKLY. 

1577
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,270
IT'S GOING TO BE ROUGH GOING 

1578
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,273
HERE IN TALLAHASSEE AS WERE 

1579
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,874
STARTING TO SEE REPORTS FROM 

1580
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:25,876
THE COAST AND A SLIGHTLY WEAKER 

1581
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,711
OF HURRICANE MICHAEL  BEGINS TO 

1582
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,445
MAKE ITS WAY HERE INTO THE 

1583
00:52:29,445 --> 00:52:32,716
CAPITAL. 

1584
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,784
>> YOU LIVE IN MIAMI AND YOU 

1585
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,519
KNOW ABOUT HURRICANE COVERAGE. 

1586
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:37,487
I'M JUST CURIOUS. 

1587
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:41,291
WHAT OF THE STORES LIKE? 

1588
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,592
WHAT OF PEOPLE DONE TO PREPARE 

1589
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:43,192
AT THIS POINT? 

1590
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:45,829
WHAT PEOPLE ADVISE YOU TO DO 

1591
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,064
WHEN YOU KNOW THIS IS COMING? 

1592
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,332
>> Reporter: WE GOT HERE AND 

1593
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,434
WHEN YOU LAND IN ONE OF THESE 

1594
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,270
AREAS BEFORE DISASTER, YOU LOOK 

1595
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,039
FOR WATER. IMMEDIATELY THE 

1596
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,541
FIRST WALMART I WENT TO WAS OUT 

1597
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:02,946
OF BREAD AND WATER. 

1598
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:03,980
PEOPLE DID PREPARE. 

1599
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,748
THERE WERE GAS LINES. 

1600
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:05,782
WE ARE NOT SEEING MANY OF THOSE 

1601
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:05,982
NOW. 

1602
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,284
THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF THE 

1603
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,051
STATIONS HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP 

1604
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,352
UP THE PUMPS. 

1605
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:13,223
AT THIS POINT, -- AND WE HAVE 

1606
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,491
HEARD THE OFFICIALS SAY IT OVER 

1607
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,725
AND OVER, IF YOU'RE NO LONGER 

1608
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,660
PREPARED OR IF YOU'RE STILL 

1609
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,295
TRYING TO PREPARE, I SHOULD SAY,

1610
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,030
THE TIME IS REALLY UP. 

1611
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,501
RIGHT NOW, IT IS JUST BRACE FOR 

1612
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:24,734
IT. 

1613
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,704
HUNKER DOWN AND GET ENDORSED TO 

1614
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,972
THE INTER-MOST PART OF ANY 

1615
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:29,272
BUILDING. 

1616
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,474
YOU MENTIONED THE LESSONS 

1617
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,243
LEARNED ESPECIALLY AFTER IRMA 

1618
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,110
LAST YEAR. 

1619
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,313
YOU'LL RECALL THERE WAS A 

1620
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,580
HORRIBLE INCIDENT AT A NURSING 

1621
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,249
HOME WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER 

1622
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,750
THE POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOR 

1623
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,420
DAYS. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 

1624
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,256
THE POWER BACK TO THE BUILDING. 

1625
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,190
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 

1626
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,490
GENERATOR. 

1627
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,758
THERE IS A NEW LAW IN FLORIDA 

1628
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,193
THAT IS AIMING TO PREVENT THAT 

1629
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:51,661
KIND OF A TRAGEDY FROM 

1630
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,596
HAPPENING AGAIN AND REQUIRING 

1631
00:53:53,596 --> 00:53:55,665
ALL NURSING HOMES AND ASSISTED 

1632
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,266
LIVING FACILITIES TO HAVE A 

1633
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:58,668
GENERATOR. 

1634
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,069
BUT AFTER THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 

1635
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:03,239
1, NUMBERS SHOW THAT A LOT OF 

1636
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,274
THOSE FACILITIES -- ESPECIALLY 

1637
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,976
IN THIS AREA, DO NOT HAVE THOSE 

1638
00:54:06,976 --> 00:54:09,846
INSTALLED YET FOR MANY REASONS. 

1639
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,047
THERE IS A LABOR SHORTAGE AND 

1640
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,516
ALSO A SHORTAGE OF SUPPLIES. 

1641
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,784
BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO PROVE 

1642
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:15,785
THEY CAN KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. 

1643
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:19,522
THAT'S SOMETHING THE STATE IS 

1644
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:20,190
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY INTO. 

1645
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,291
THAT'S WHY THE POWER COMPANIES 

1646
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:25,061
LOOKING TO WRITE OUR TIES -- TO 

1647
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:29,666
PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS. 

1648
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,734
YOU CAN SEE THE TREES REALLY 

1649
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:31,501
ARE GETTING GOING. 

1650
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,569
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW IT IS 

1651
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,170
STARTING TO BECOME MORE 

1652
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:34,804
CONSISTENT. 

1653
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,139
IS NO LONGER ONCE EVERY 10 

1654
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:36,406
MINUTES. 

1655
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,808
IT IS STARTING TO BE A REGULAR 

1656
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,110
FLOW THROUGH HERE. 

1657
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,378
CLEARLY, MICHAEL IS GETTING 

1658
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,378
CLOSER. 

1659
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:46,149
INTERESTING YOU CAN PREDICT THAT

1660
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,149
BY LOOKING AT THE TREES. 

1661
00:54:47,149 --> 00:54:48,618
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

1662
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,086
STAY SAFE. 

1663
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:52,689
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SPOKE 

1664
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:53,890
WITH FEMA ADMINISTRATOR BROCK 

1665
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:58,094
LONG AND KIRSTJEN NIELSEN ABOUT 

1666
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:58,762
 

1667
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,596
HURRICANE MICHAEL.  

1668
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,198
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT 

1669
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,700
THE EVACUATIONS. 

1670
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,569
>> DEPENDING WHAT HAPPENS HERE 

1671
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,404
-- THEY ARE ALL EITHER CONTACTED

1672
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:11,374
OR IN THE PROCESS. I HAD A LONG 

1673
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,511
TALK WITH RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA.

1674
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,179
VERY WELL COORDINATED WITH ALL 

1675
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:16,613
OF THE STATES. 

1676
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:20,450
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MUST BE 

1677
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,419
SAID IS IT IS NOT SO EASY FOR 

1678
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,653
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO LEAVE. 

1679
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,321
SOME OF THE AREAS ARE VERY 

1680
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:25,521
POOR. 

1681
00:55:25,521 --> 00:55:26,856
IT IS NOT EASY FOR A PERSON 

1682
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,058
WITHOUT THE NECESSARY MONEY TO 

1683
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:29,426
LEAVE. 

1684
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:32,495
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE SENT BUSES 

1685
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,464
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- WE 

1686
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:38,468
ARE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT 

1687
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,636
THINGS TO TRY TO REMOVE PEOPLE 

1688
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:40,370
FROM THE AREA. 

1689
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,805
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY POOR 

1690
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:42,372
IN THOSE AREAS. 

1691
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,873
IT IS VERY TOUGH FOR THEM TO 

1692
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:44,106
LEAVE. 

1693
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:45,208
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU 

1694
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,176
ARE FINDING. 

1695
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,076
>> YES. 

1696
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:53,116
IN SOME CASES, WHAT WE ASK TO 

1697
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,584
DO ON BLUE SKY DAYS IS AS 

1698
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,719
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE 

1699
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,986
MEANS OR MECHANISMS TO GET OUT 

1700
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,088
TO REGISTER WITH LOCAL AGENCIES

1701
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:00,123
. FLORIDA HAS BEEN PRETTY 

1702
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:04,427
ROBUST IN DOING THAT. 

1703
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,761
AND WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE 

1704
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:07,197
ABLE TO SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT OF 

1705
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:07,430
PEOPLE. 

1706
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,066
WHEN IT COMES TO GEORGIA, WE 

1707
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:10,834
ARE NOT EVACUATING FOR STORM 

1708
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,001
SURGE IN GEORGIA. 

1709
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,603
THIS IS GOING TO BE HIGH WINDS. 

1710
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:17,073
WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET IN 

1711
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,741
FACILITY THAT CAN WITHSTAND 

1712
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:24,247
THOSE WINDS. 

1713
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,782
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE SIZE AND 

1714
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,484
HOW LONG IT IS, TAKE A LOOK AT 

1715
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,052
THAT AND THE RED AREA. 

1716
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,320
THAT'S THE AREA WHERE IT WILL 

1717
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,987
HIT PRETTY HEAVILY. 

1718
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,857
THAT'S A LOT OF SURE. 

1719
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:41,331
IT'S A LOT OF LAND -- LOT OF 

1720
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,133
SHORE. 

1721
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:47,270
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND. 

1722
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,073
>> IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE 

1723
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,508
OF THE GOLF. 

1724
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:59,048
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT -- THE 

1725
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:03,586
GULF. THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT 

1726
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:03,819
BEFORE. 

1727
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:05,321
>>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

1728
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:05,721
MONITOR MICHAEL. 

1729
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:06,756
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE. 

1730
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,256
STAY WITH US. 

1731
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:08,324
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.  

1732
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:15,899
ALWAYS ON.

1733
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,081
STRICT HURRICANE MICHAEL HAS 

1734
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:15,118
MADE  LANDFALL IN FLORIDA. 

1735
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,420
THE STORM IS DAMNING -- 

1736
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,356
SLAMMING PANAMA CITY. 

1737
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,925
STORM SURGE IS THE GREATEST 

1738
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:22,558
THREAT. 

1739
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:26,996
WATER COULD RISE 14 FEET. 

1740
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,131
PRESIDEN TRUMP STRESSED IT IS 

1741
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,666
TOO LATE TO EVACUATE. 

1742
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,334
THE HEAD OF FEMA SAYS 

1743
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,903
OPERATIONS WILL BEGIN AFTER THE 

1744
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,371
WORST OF THE STORM CLEARS. 

1745
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,874
>> WE HAVE TEAMS NOT ONLY WITH 

1746
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:40,643
AND EMBEDDED WITH THE STAFF AND 

1747
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:44,580
SOME OF THE LOCAL COUNTY 

1748
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,448
EMERGENCY MANAGERS BUT WE HAVE 

1749
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,350

ORLANDO. 

1752
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,329
>> DAVID PARKINSON JOINS US NOW.

1753
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,897
DAVID, WHAT'S THE LATEST? 

1754
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:06,169
>> THE STORM IS MED LANDFALL. 

1755
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,236
-- MADE LANDFALL. 

1756
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,138
IT CONTINUES TO LOOK FAIRLY 

1757
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:09,405
HEALTHY. 

1758
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:10,440
STORMS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO GREAT 

1759
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,409
BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE KEEPING 

1760
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,510
ITS ACT TOGETHER. 

1761
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,946
WE ARE ONTO PART TWO OF THE 

1762
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:20,416
STORM WHAT SHALL BE THE INLAND 

1763
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:20,682
IMPACTS. 

1764
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:22,985
THE STORM SURGE IS STILL RISING 

1765
01:00:22,985 --> 01:00:26,089
IN PLACES. 

1766
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,523
WHAT IF YOU ARE IN PANAMA CITY 

1767
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,192
OR PANAMA CITY BEACH,  YOU HAVE 

1768
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,660
ANOTHER HOUR OR SO OF THE EYE 

1769
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,096
WALL TO GOOD DEAL WITH. 

1770
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:37,834
-- TO DEAL WITH. 

1771
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,669
THIS IS JUST WHAT WAS RECORDED

BROKEN. 

1774
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,207
THIS SHOULD GIVE YOU AN 

1775
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,541
INDICATION OF HOW SERIOUS THIS 

1776
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:45,741
IS. 

1777
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,677
THERE IS NO EVACUATING. 

1778
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,846
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS 

1779
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,147
AND WILL BE FOR THE NEXT 

1780
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:51,680
SEVERAL HOURS. 

1781
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,816
>> WALK ME THROUGH THE NEXT 

1782
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,183
SEVERAL HOURS. 

1783
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,484
WHO WAS AT RISK? 

1784
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:58,588
>> WE ARE LOOKING ALONG THE I-

1785
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:02,858
10 AREA FROM PANAMA CITY TO I-

1786
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:03,493
10.  

1787
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,328
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE 

1788
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,396
WINDS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 

1789
01:01:07,396 --> 01:01:09,098
HOURS. 

1790
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,299
BEYOND THAT, WE ARE LOOK AT

01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,305
AND THEN INTO SOUTHWESTERN 

1795
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,273
GEORGIA AS WELL.

CATEGORY TWO INTO GEORGIA UP 

1798
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:29,552
ALMOST TOWARDS BACON -- MACON. 

1799
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,154
THEN IT WILL BE INLAND FROM 

1800
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:33,556
CHARLESTON AND SAVANNAH. 

1801
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,091
THEY'LL BE GETTING STORM SURGE 

1802
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,994
AND WINS IN THE 50s AND 60s. 

1803
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:44,801

1804
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,135
FOR TOMORROW, WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:46,969
THE STORM CONTINUING TO MAKE 

1806
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:47,470
ITS WAY NORTH. 

1807
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,172
THAT WOULD BE INTO THE 

1808
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,874
CAROLINAS AND PLACES WHERE THEY 

1809
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,276
SCARCELY NEED MORE RAIN AFTER 

1810
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:53,709
HURRICANE FLORENCE. 

1811
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:54,744
THEY COULD BE SEEING ANOTHER

THREE, FOUR, SIX, EIGHT INCHES 

1813
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:00,683
DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE. 

1814
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,051
SOME OF THE RIVER STILL HAVEN'T 

1815
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:02,351
COME DOWN. 

1816
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,320
BY FRIDAY MORNING, THIS IS OFF

01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,822
THE COAST ALREADY AND IT 

1818
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,557
BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL. 

1819
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,725
WE COULD BE SEEING SOME GUSTS 

1820
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,793
IN NEW YORK BUT ONCE THE STORM 

1821
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:14,564
MAKES IT PAST NORFORK, THE 

1822
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,198
DANGER IS FOR THE MOST PART 

1823
01:02:16,198 --> 01:02:16,899
DONE. 

1824
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,801
BY NO MEANS IS THAT THREAT DONE 

1825
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:23,372
IN THE INLAND AREAS. 

1826
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:26,175
>> THEY ARE SAYING MICHAEL 

1827
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,410
COULD BE ONE OF THE HEARSE TO 

1828
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,345
HIT THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE EVER. 

1829
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,213
YES. 

1830
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,514
IT ALREADY HAS. 

1831
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:32,815
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN 

1832
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:34,183
CHRONOLOGICALLY. 

1833
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,353
SINCE 1960, WE'VE ONLY HAD TWO 

1834
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:39,255
STORMS MAKE LANDFALL WITH 

1835
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,289
HIGHER WIND SPEEDS. 

1836
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,490
THAT WOULD BE CAMILLE AND 

1837
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:41,723
ANDREW. 

1838
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:43,726
WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE WITH THE 

1839
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:45,361
STRONGER CENTRAL PRESSURE. 

1840
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,496
THAT'S CAMILLE. 

1841
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:49,198
IN TERMS OF THE DEEPNESS OF THE 

1842
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,700
CENTRAL PRESSURE, IT IS 

1843
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,568
STRONGER THAN AND YOUR. 

1844
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:58,241
THAT SHOULD SHOW YOU -- ANDREW. 

1845
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,442
THAT SHOULD SHOW YOU HOW STRONG 

1846
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,943
THIS IS. 

1847
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,178
THE DEVASTATION IN TERMS OF 

1848
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:06,082
ROOFS AND CARS TOPPLED OVER, WE 

1849
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,751
CAN SEE THAT QUICKLY. 

1850
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,186
WE MIGHT EVEN SEE SOME OF THE 

1851
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,687
FIRST PICTURES BEFORE THE NIGHT 

1852
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,524
TONIGHT BUT BY NO MEANS SHOULD 

1853
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,192
YOU BE GOING OUT TO SURVEY HER 

1854
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:19,061
LOOK UNTIL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 

1855
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:22,665
-- OR LOOK UNTIL EMERGENCY 

1856
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,166
MANAGEMENT SAYS IT IS OKAY. 

1857
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,334
I'M WATCHING WHEN IS THIS GOING 

1858
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,403
TO FINALLY GET WEAKER? 

1859
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,906
HURRICANE MICHAEL  WAS 

1860
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,440
INTENSIFYING ALL THE WAY UP TO 

1861
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,742
LANDFALL. 

1862
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:35,311
HONESTLY, IT WOULD'VE MADE IT 

1863
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,180
TO CATEGORY 5 IF IT HAD ANOTHER 

1864
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:38,380
HOUR. 

1865
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,650
HOW FAR INLAND DO WE SEE THOSE 

1866
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:46,789
WINDS INTO THE 60s, 70s, 80s, 

1867
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,625
90s, 100S. 

1868
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,428
WE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY SEEING

1869
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,662
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF POWER 

1870
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,231
OUTAGES. 

1871
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,666
YOU WILL BE SEEING PEOPLE 

1872
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,235
WITHOUT POWER FOR DAYS AND IN 

1873
01:03:59,235 --> 01:03:59,802
TWO WEEKS. 

1874
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,270
THERE IS GOING TO BE SO MANY 

1875
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,771
TREES DOWN. 

1876
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,639
THEY ARE VERY TALL AND THEY 

1877
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,441
HAVE LARGE CANOPIES AND THEY 

1878
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,076
ARE EASILY WEIGHTED DOWN. 

1879
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,811
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG 

1880
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,112
CLEANUP. 

1881
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:14,417
INLAND NOT TO MENTION AT THE 

1882
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,618
COAST IN MEXICO BEACH AND 

1883
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:16,652
PANAMA CITY AND  PANAMA CITY 

1884
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,087
BEACH  WHERE SOME OF THE 

1885
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:22,925
HEAVIEST DAMAGE IS OCCURRING. 

1886
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,226
WE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 

1887
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:24,759
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 

1888
01:04:24,759 --> 01:04:26,095
>>> WE WANT TO RETURN YOU KNOW 

1889
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:31,767
FROM -- NOW TO COVERAGE FROM 

1890
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:31,967
WCTV. 

1891
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:35,304
>>> YOU CAN WATCH THIS PATH.  

1892
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,305
NOTICE HOW IT KEPT MOVING 

1893
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,006
TOWARDS THE NURSE. 

1894
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,107
IT STARTED TO GET THE IMPACTS 

1895
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,376
OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 

1896
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,844
THAT IS A HUGE PLAYER NOT ONLY 

1897
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,713
IN THE DIRECTION OF MICHAEL BUT 

1898
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,882
ALSO THE SPEED OF MICHAEL. 

1899
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:51,821
IT WAS PLAYING A HUGE PART INTO 

1900
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,689
THE FORECAST -- IF THERE IS ANY 

1901
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:57,927
GOOD NEWS IN THIS, IT'S THAT 

1902
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,161
WE'LL START TO SEE MUCH DRIER 

1903
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,529
AIR COMING IN BY TOMORROW AND 

1904
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,696
ESPECIALLY INTO FRIDAY AND 

1905
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:04,934
SATURDAY A LOT OF YOU THAT WILL 

1906
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:08,304
BE WITHOUT POWER THE 

1907
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,505
TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE WARM 

1908
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,706
AND IT WILL STILL BE HUMID. 

1909
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:14,076
THAT'S WHEN WE'LL BE 

1910
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,011
TRANSITIONING. 

1911
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,311
BY THE TIME WE GET TO TOMORROW 

1912
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:17,580
NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING WE'LL 

1913
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,849
BE TALKING ABOUT LOWS IN THE 

1914
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:24,053
LOW TO MID 60s. 

1915
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,654
AT LEAST IT WILL BE A LITTLE 

1916
01:05:25,654 --> 01:05:26,522
MORE COMFORTABLE AND EVEN SOME 

1917
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,223
50 SATURDAY MORNING. 

1918
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,425
A LOT MORE SUNSHINE AROUND AND 

1919
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,994
DRIER AIR. 

1920
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,963
THIS WILL LIKELY COME AS A MOVE 

1921
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,198
TOWARDS LATE TONIGHT AND REALLY 

1922
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,200
OVERNIGHT WHEN THE RAIN STARTS 

1923
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,769
TO DEPART. 

1924
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,671
LET'S LOOK AT THE RADAR. 

1925
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,507
THIS IS A LIVE IMAGE LOOKING 

1926
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,041
TOWARDS THE COAST. 

1927
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,508
YOU CAN SEE THE CENTER OF 

1928
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:50,746
MICHAEL -- YOU CAN SEE THE 

1929
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:51,480
HEAVY RAINFALL STRETCHED OUT. 

1930
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,615
IT SEEMS TO BE CONFINED. 

1931
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,816
IT STOPS PRETTY MUCH OVER THE 

1932
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:55,884
EASTERN PARTS OF ECHOLS AND 

1933
01:05:55,884 --> 01:05:58,320
SUWANEE COUNTIES. 

1934
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:04,359
THE MOST INTENSE AREAS WITHIN 

1935
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:05,328
ROUGHLY 50 MILES OF THE CENTER. 

1936
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,629
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE MUCH 

1937
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,396
HIGHER RAINFALL RATES. 

1938
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,432
IT IS SO HEAVY IT IS LIKE 

1939
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:12,568
POURING A BUCKET OF WATER INTO 

1940
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:13,502
THE RAIN GAUGE. 

1941
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:14,270
THEY CAN'T KEEP UP. 

1942
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,305
WE COULD EASILY SEE FOUR TO 

1943
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:20,109
EIGHT OR EVEN EIGHT TO 12 

1944
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:20,509
INCHES. 

1945
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,111
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE 

1946
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,346
THOSE KINDS OF TOTALS EVEN 

1947
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,714
THOUGH IT IS A FAST-MOVING 

1948
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:25,948
SYSTEM. 

1949
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,149
HERE'S A CLOSER VIEW. 

1950
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:30,186
CLEARLY IF YOU ARE WATCHING US 

1951
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,689
IN CALHOUN COUNTY OR SSI I 

1952
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:34,523
CONTINUES TO MOVE TO THE 

1953
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:37,793
NORTHEAST -- AS THIS EYE 

1954
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,663
CONTINUS TO MOVE TO THE 

1955
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,430
NORTHEAST, IT WILL CONTINUE TO 

1956
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,832
BE AN EYE. 

1957
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:48,604
KEEP IN MIND WHILE IT WILL BE 

1958
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,472
GETTING WEAKER, YOU'RE GOING TO 

1959
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,373
GO FROM INTENSE WINDS AND THEN 

1960
01:06:51,373 --> 01:06:52,007
GO NEARLY CALM. 

1961
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:55,878
DO NO GO OUT WHEN THE EYE 

1962
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:56,612
PASSES OVER. 

1963
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,682
I KNOW IT IS TEMPTING. 

1964
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,786
IT WILL START TO FILL IN SEE 

1965
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,354
PROBABLY WON'T SEE THE SUNSHINE 

1966
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,188
BREAKING THROUGH. 

1967
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,124
THERE IS A STILL A CHANCE YOU 

1968
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,359
COULD ACTUALLY SEE BLUE SKY AND 

1969
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,594
SUNSHINE ABOVE. 

1970
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:12,762
IT WON'T BE AS SPECTACULAR TO 

1971
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:17,333
SEE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE MOST 

1972
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,734
INTENSE WINDS MAY START TO GO 

1973
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,803
AWAY AND MAKE IT NEARLY CALM. 

1974
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:21,403
BUT THEN THE BACKSIDE HAS THE 

1975
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:23,472
SAME LEVEL OF INTENSE WIND. 

1976
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,274
IT WILL COME QUICKLY. 

1977
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:28,811
I KNOW IT IS TEMPTING TO 

1978
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,146
VENTURE OUT BUT JUST DON'T DO 

1979
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:30,413
IT. 

1980
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,847
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE 

1981
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:32,548
WINDOW, THAT'S FINE. 

1982
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,049
AND THEN WE START TO SEE THE 

1983
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:35,584
BREEZE PICKING BACK UP, GET 

1984
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:38,120
AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS AGAIN. 

1985
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,555
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO SEE THOSE 

1986
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:43,125
WINDS THAT COULD EXCEED 100 

1987
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:43,926
MILES PER HOUR IN GUS. 

1988
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,961
IT WILL GET WEAKER QUICKLY AS 

1989
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:50,266
IT MOVES INTO JACKSON AND 

1990
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:55,571
DECATUR COUNTIES. 

1991
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,139
WIND GUST IN EXCESS OF 75 MILES 

1992
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:58,908
PER HOUR ARE LIKELY. 

1993
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:02,044
PUT THIS INTO MOTION, THERE IS 

1994
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:09,285
THE CLASSIC COUNTERCLOCKWISE 

1995
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:09,551
MOVEMENT. 

1996
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:10,286
STILL SEEING SOME LIGHTNING 

1997
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:11,453
AROUND THE CORE AND THE EYE 

1998
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:11,653
WALL. 

1999
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:12,621
IT SHOWS INCREDIBLY INTENSE 

2000
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:13,556
RAINFALL RATES COMING OUT OF 

2001
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:13,822
THAT. 

2002
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:14,857
THE FLASH FLOODING IS GOING 

2003
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,424
ALONG WITH THAT. 

2004
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,327
IT IS BLINDING RAIN ALONG WITH 

2005
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:19,929
WINDS THAT ARE 100 MILES PER 

2006
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:20,629
HOUR. 

2007
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:24,332
THIS IS WHAT A MAJOR HURRICANE 

2008
01:08:24,332 --> 01:08:27,036
LOOKS LIKE. 

2009
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,370
ONCE YOU GET BEYOND 50 MILES OR 

2010
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,470
SO FROM THAT CENTER WHEN WE 

2011
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:34,676
START TO SEE MORE REASONABLE 

2012
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:34,910
WINDS. 

2013
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,478
I HATE TO USE THAT TERM BECAUSE 

2014
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:37,912
IT SOUNDS TOO NICE BUT AT LEAST 

2015
01:08:37,912 --> 01:08:40,049
THEY AREN'T IN THAT 70 TO 80 

2016
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:40,616
MILE PER HOUR RANGE. 

2017
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,184
THE RAINFALL FOR ALL OF THE 

2018
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,551
VIEWING AREA, IT IS CERTAINLY 

2019
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,087
LIGHTER TOWARDS THE EAST. 

2020
01:08:46,087 --> 01:08:49,758
WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE 

2021
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:50,792
POSSIBILITY FOR TORNADOES. 

2022
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:52,461
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY STRONG 

2023
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:56,232
ROTATIONS BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO 

2024
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:56,631
WATCH THESE. 

2025
01:08:56,631 --> 01:09:01,937
THESE ARE OFFSHORE FROM FRANKLIN

2026
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:02,904
COUNTY TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST 

2027
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:03,939
AND BACK TOWARDS THE NORTH. 

2028
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:04,907
ALSO THESE BINS THROUGH TAYLOR 

2029
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:05,841
COUNTY AND EVEN THE ONES 

2030
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,010
WITHOUT HERE TOWARDS THE EAST 

2031
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,179
FROM NEAR CEDAR KEY AND THE 

2032
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:10,979
SUWANEE RIVER VALLEY. 

2033
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,413
THESE NEED TO BE WATCHED 

2034
01:09:12,413 --> 01:09:15,350
CLOSELY. 

2035
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,484
IT'S ANOTHER GOOD REASON YOU 

2036
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:17,486
SHOULD BE IN A SAFE PLACE. 

2037
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,654
MANY TIMES THESE TYPES OF 

2038
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,290
TORNADOES AREN'T YOUR CLASSIC, 

2039
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,158
-- THERE IS ONE YOU CONTRACT. 

2040
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:26,694
IT'S EMBEDDED WITH THIS. 

2041
01:09:26,694 --> 01:09:28,029
WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO MONITOR 

2042
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:28,930
IT AND THE NATIONAL WEATHER 

2043
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,198
SERVICE IS DOING A GREAT JOB 

2044
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:33,702
AND ALERTING US -- WE DON'T 

2045
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:34,135
ISSUE THE WARNINGS. 

2046
01:09:34,135 --> 01:09:35,303
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE 

2047
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:41,810
DOES. 

2048
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,810
THEN WE PASS THEM ALONG. 

2049
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:44,145
SOME OF THESE HAPPEN VERY, VERY 

2050
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:44,412
QUICKLY. 

2051
01:09:44,412 --> 01:09:45,781
IT CAN DEVELOP IN A MINUTE OR 

2052
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:47,283
TWO AND THEN GO AWAY IN A 

2053
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:47,983
MINUTE OR TWO. 

2054
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:48,884
WE'LL WATCH THAT. 

2055
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,085
TYPICALLY, YOU SEE THEM OUT 

2056
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,319
OVER THE WATER ROTATING GIVES 

2057
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:58,260
YOU A LITTLE LEAD TIME. 

2058
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,828
BUT JUST BE READY TO MOVE TO A 

2059
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,063
SAFE PLACE OVER EASTERN AREAS. 

2060
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:03,732
YOU SHOULD ALREADY BE IN A SAFE 

2061
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,301
PLACE IF YOU ARE IN THE WESTERN 

2062
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:06,168
HALF OF THE AREA. 

2063
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,970
I PLOTTED THIS JUST BEFORE HE 

2064
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,339
STARTED SO SOME NUMBERS HAVE 

2065
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:10,906
PROBABLY CHANGED. 

2066
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,474
I KNOW IT IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT 

2067
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:12,708
COLORS. 

2068
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,742
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WIND 

2069
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:14,042
VELOCITIES. 

2070
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:19,014
I JUST PLOTTED SAMPLING TO SHOW 

2071
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,182
YOU -- GRANTED FROM THE RADAR, 

2072
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:21,383
THIS IS SHOOTING UP. 

2073
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:25,087
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ELEVATED. 

2074
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,021
WERE NOT LIKELY SEEING THESE 

2075
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,356
WINDS AT THE SURFACE BUT 

2076
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:31,560
PERHAPS NOT TOO FAR FROM THAT. 

2077
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,295
WHERE I SAMPLED THIS, IT SHOWED 

2078
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,096
WINDS OF 72 MILES PER HOUR. 

2079
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,331
WHERE I LOOKED AT THIS OVER 

2080
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,965
CALHOUN COUNTY, IT SHOWED 94 

2081
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:38,834
MILES PER HOUR. 

2082
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,403
GOVE COUNTY, 83 MILES PER HOUR. 

2083
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,773
ON THE EYE WALL SIDE, OVER INTO 

2084
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:48,911
BAY COUNTY, 114 MILES PER HOUR. 

2085
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,179
SO CLEARLY, THE RADAR IS 

2086
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:54,283
SHOWING WE HAVE THESE WINDS. 

2087
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,184
REMEMBER, THOSE INTENSE STORMS 

2088
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,719
THAT I SHOWED YOU IN THE EYE 

2089
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,790
WALL, THOSE ARE DOWN DRAFTS. 

2090
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,459
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME OF 

2091
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:04,426
THAT WIND AND FORCE IT DOWN 

2092
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:04,893
TOWARDS THE SURFACE. 

2093
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,762
THOSE ARE LIKELY THE TYPES OF 

2094
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,932
CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE THE 129 

2095
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,368
GUST THAT WE SAW. 

2096
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,203
THE INTENSE STORMS WITH THE EYE 

2097
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,105
WALL AND THE WINDS AT THE 

2098
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,875
SURFACE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 

2099
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:20,776
INITIALLY THAT STRONG BUT ONCE 

2100
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:21,810
CAME ALONG, IT FORCED THE 

2101
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,445
STRONGER WINDS DOWN TOWARDS THE 

2102
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,613
SURFACE. 

2103
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,115
THIS IS VERIFICATION USING 

2104
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,182
RADAR. 

2105
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:30,185
WE ARE SEEING WINDS THAT ARE 

2106
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,788
EXCEEDING HURRICANE FORCE. 

2107
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,324
LET'S WIDEN OUT ENJOY THE 

2108
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:36,125
SATELLITE VIEW. 

2109
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,893
THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT WAY TO SEE 

2110
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:38,427
THE EYE WALL. 

2111
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:41,363
THIS IS JUST TO THE NORTHWEST 

2112
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,298
OF MEXICO BEACH JUST BEFORE 

2113
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:43,498
2:00. 

2114
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:46,568
155 MILE PER HOUR WINDS. 

2115
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:49,538
TO KEEP SUCH A SHY OF BEING A 

2116
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:50,506
CATEGORY 5. HOPEFULLY, THERE IS 

2117
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:53,409
NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO AT THIS 

2118
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:57,012
POINT. IF YOU'RE AT THE COAST 

2119
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,480
AND HE DECIDED TO STAY, WE ARE 

2120
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,448
EXPECTING THE SEARCH TO REACH 

2121
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,516
EIGHT TO 12 FEET. 

2122
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,151
IF THERE IS ANY KIND OF 

2123
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,820
POSITIVE NEWS, IT MADE LANDFALL 

2124
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,222
ROUGHLY OVER HERE AND THAT 

2125
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,757
COULD BE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE 

2126
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:14,196
COMPARED TO KEEP SAN BLAS OR 

2127
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:18,000
APALACHICOLA , THE STRONGEST 

2128
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,669
WATER WATER BEEN DRIVEN INTO 

2129
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:21,770
FRANKLIN AND JEFFERSON AND 

2130
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,238
TAYLOR COUNTIES. 

2131
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,075
WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO HIGH 

2132
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:26,875
TIDE OUT. 

2133
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:30,679
THE SURGE HEIGHT STILL -- THIS 

2134
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,880
ISN'T GOING TO GET BETTER HERE 

2135
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,215
UNTIL WE GET TO TONIGHT WHEN 

2136
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,184
THE CIRCULATION MOVES INLAND 

2137
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,987
AND THE WINDS CHANGE DIRECTION. 

2138
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:40,122
THESE ARE THE SUSTAINED WINDS 

2139
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,423
AS MEASURED ACROSS THE VIEWING 

2140
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:42,257
AREA. 

2141
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:43,792
FROM 26 MILES PER HOUR IN 

2142
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,061
MARIANNA TO 33 IN TALLAHASSEE. 

2143
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,330
IS NOT A BIG DEAL. THE 

2144
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,432
SUSTAINED WINDS RIGHT NOW -- 

2145
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:55,737
ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN HALF ARE 

2146
01:12:55,737 --> 01:12:57,072
NOT A BIG DEAL. 

2147
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,040
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME GAS AND 

2148
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,141
THERE'S THE THREAT FOR SEVERE 

2149
01:12:59,141 --> 01:12:59,408
WEATHER. 

2150
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,144
DON'T PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN. 

2151
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,379
-- GUSTS AND THERE'S THE THREAT 

2152
01:13:04,379 --> 01:13:07,082
FOR SEVERE WEATHER. 

2153
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,484
DON'T PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN. 

2154
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:11,086
AT TIMES THEY'VE EXCEEDED 60. 

2155
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:13,322
IF YOU LOOK AT PANAMA CITY, 

2156
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:14,556
SUSTAINED WIND AT 46.  

2157
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,824
THESE ARE A ONE MINUTE AVERAGE. 

2158
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:20,062
NOW WE LOOK AT THE GUSTS. 

2159
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,564
I DID SEE ONE EARLIER 56. 

2160
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,966
NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE 

2161
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:28,804
WINDS CONTINUING TO GUST IN 

2162
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:29,471
APALACHICOLA UP TO 84. 

2163
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,472
66 IN PANAMA CITY.  

2164
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,808
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF STATIONS 

2165
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:33,475
IN THIS AREA. 

2166
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,410
THERE ARE JUST A COUPLE 

2167
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,213
UNOFFICIAL STATIONS THAT WE'RE 

2168
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:39,781
TRYING TO MONITOR. 

2169
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:46,722
YOU'RE GETTING A GOOD IDEA OF 

2170
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:48,690
THE WIND FIELD AND HOW IT IS 

2171
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,257
CONCENTRATED HERE WITH THE 

2172
01:13:49,257 --> 01:13:50,025
STRONGEST WINDS AND THEN IT 

2173
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,360
DROPS OFF TO A MODERATE LEVEL, 

2174
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,361
MODERATELY SEVERE IF IT WILL. 

2175
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,096
AND THEN IT DROPS OFF TO PLAIN 

2176
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,231
OLD WINDY CONDITIONS THE 

2177
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,967
FURTHER EAST YOU GO. 

2178
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,535
SINCE IT IS MOVING TOWARDS THE 

2179
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:02,237
NORTHEAST, THESE STRONG WINDS 

2180
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,973
-- THEY'LL BE GETTING WEAKER, 

2181
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,174
BUT THEY ARE MOVING INTO PARTS 

2182
01:14:06,174 --> 01:14:07,376
OF SOUTHWEST GEORGIA. 

2183
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,512
FROM BAKER TO MITCHELL DOWN TO 

2184
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,681
GRADY AND DECATUR, YOU NEED TO 

2185
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,884
PREPARE FOR THAT POSSIBILITY OF 

2186
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,186
EXCEEDING 75 MILES PER HOUR AT 

2187
01:14:18,186 --> 01:14:22,224
LEAST. IN FACT, HERE IS FUTURE 

2188
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:22,891
CAST. 

2189
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:29,398
IT STARTS IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR 

2190
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,666
SO AND KEEPS THAT CORE OF WINDS 

2191
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:30,999
HERE. 

2192
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:32,301
AS WE MOVE AHEAD, WE GET TO 

2193
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,569
DINNERTIME OR SO AND WE ARE 

2194
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,470
STARTING TO SEE THAT CORE OF 50 

2195
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,372
TO 60 MILE-PER-HOUR. 

2196
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:42,878
THESE ARE THE SUSTAINED WINDS. 

2197
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:43,779
THIS IS JUST ONE FORECAST BUT 

2198
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:44,746
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. 

2199
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,114
NOTICE THE SHIFT IN DIRECTION 

2200
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,416
TOO. 

2201
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,650
IT IS STILL COMING FROM THE 

2202
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:48,883
SOUTH. 

2203
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:50,853
NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE 

2204
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:51,887
APALACHICOLA WITH WINDS  

2205
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:58,694
STRTING TO DIE DOWN A BIT. 

2206
01:14:58,694 --> 01:14:59,895
MOVE AHEAD A LITTLE MORE IN 

2207
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,330
TIME AND WE'RE LOOKING AT 

2208
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,097
OVERNIGHT. 

2209
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:04,333
STILL WINDY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 

2210
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,000
PARTS OF THE AREA. 

2211
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,268
SUSTAINED WINDS IN 30 TO 40 

2212
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,202
MILE-PER-HOUR RANGE. 

2213
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:09,504
THAT IS STILL TROPICAL STORM 

2214
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:13,041
FORCE WINDS. 

2215
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:13,909
IT IS STILL BREEZY. 

2216
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:14,843
IS NOT SUDDENLY CALM. 

2217
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:15,877
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNTIL 

2218
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:17,613
TOMORROW OR TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 

2219
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:23,485
THIS IS A BIG, HUGE, POWERFUL 

2220
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:23,885
SYSTEM. 

2221
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:24,953
AS WE CONTINUE TO GO INTO 

2222
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,488
TOMORROW MORNING, NOW WE START 

2223
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:30,959
TO SEE THAT RELAXATION IN THE 

2224
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,294
WINDS AND COMING MORE FROM THE 

2225
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:32,494
WEST. 

2226
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:33,729
YOU NOTICE TOO WHILE THEY HAVE 

2227
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,231
STARTED TO SLACK OFF, ONSHORE 

2228
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,165
FLOW IS STILL THERE. 

2229
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,099
IT'S A LIGHT SOUTHWEST WIND 

2230
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:38,867
RELATIVELY SPEAKING BUT THE 

2231
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:44,272
WATER WILL TAKE A WHILE TO 

2232
01:15:44,272 --> 01:15:45,307
RESEED OVER TAYLOR COUNTY. 

2233
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,441
IT BECOMES MORE OF AN OFFSHORE 

2234
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:47,409
WIND FOR FRANKLIN COUNTY IN 

2235
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:48,577
PARALLEL TO THE COAST, THEY 

2236
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,446
WILL GET LATER BUT IT WILL KEEP 

2237
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,015
THE WATER IN PLACE LONGER IN 

2238
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,984
TAYLOR COUNTY THEN PERHAPS 

2239
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:56,317
OTHER AREAS. 

2240
01:15:56,317 --> 01:15:57,953
IT IS NOT JUST GOING TO -- 

2241
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:01,790
>> YOU BEEN LISTENING TO 

2242
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:02,357
COVERAGE FROM TALLAHASSEE. 

2243
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,892
WANT TO CHECK IN WITH TEAMS ON 

2244
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:04,225
THE GROUND. 

2245
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:07,429
NICOLE JOINS US NOW. 

2246
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:08,463
EARLIER YOUR CREW WAS WORKING 

2247
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:11,800
HARD TO KEEP UP THE GEAR. 

2248
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,968
WE SEE FROM YOU LIVE SHOT, 

2249
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:14,669
THOSE TREES ARE BLOWING IN THE 

2250
01:16:14,669 --> 01:16:15,137
WIND. 

2251
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:16,071
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 

2252
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:16,471
EXPERIENCING NOW. 

2253
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,173
>> Reporter: AT THIS POINT, WE 

2254
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:25,681
HAVE TAKEN SHELTER. WE HAD TO 

2255
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,882
COME IN BECAUSE AT THAT POINT, 

2256
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:27,983
THE STORM WAS MAKING LANDFALL. 

2257
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,451
THE RAIN AND THE WIND REALLY 

2258
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:36,324
GOT VERY INTENSE. 

2259
01:16:36,324 --> 01:16:39,394
THAT TRADITIONAL CLASSIC SOUND 

2260
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:40,796
OF A TRAIN THAT YOU HEAR WITH 

2261
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,831
THE STRONG WINDS GUSTING 

2262
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:44,266
THROUGH. 

2263
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,034
SO WE HAVE KIND OF BEEN HANGING 

2264
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:49,671
OUT, IF YOU WILL. 

2265
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,807
WE HAVE LOST POWER, EVEN SOME 

2266
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:54,543
PARTS OF THE HOTEL ARE STARTING 

2267
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:58,313
TO COME APART AS WELL. 

2268
01:16:58,313 --> 01:16:59,448
CEILING TILES HAVE COME DOWN. 

2269
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,749
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME LEAKS 

2270
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,753
COMING FROM THE CEILING. 

2271
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:05,821
THERE ARE OTHER MEDIA HERE AS 

2272
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:06,021
WELL. 

2273
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,089
EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO NAVIGATE 

2274
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,091
THE SITUATION AS BEST WE CAN. 

2275
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,093
IT DOES APPEAR THAT SOME OF THE 

2276
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:19,434
WINDS HAVE STARTED TO DIE DOWN. 

2277
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:20,669
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU'LL 

2278
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,370
HAVE TO TAKE SHELTER AT THIS 

2279
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:22,603
POINT? 

2280
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:30,946
>> I WOULD THINK FOR THE NEXT 

2281
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:31,279
HOUR OR TWO. 

2282
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,080
THERE IS STILL DEBRIS BLOWING 

2283
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:32,814
AROUND OUT THERE. 

2284
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,350
IN FACT, WHERE WE WORK WE JUST 

2285
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,486
SAW -- AS I MENTIONED, A WALL 

2286
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:45,093
OF WATER COMING THROUGH. 

2287
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,194
SOME OF THAT HAS RECEDED BUT 

2288
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:47,496
AGAIN, I'M LOOKING RIGHT NOW AT 

2289
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,865
ALL TYPES OF DEBRIS THAT IS ON 

2290
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,500
THE GROUND. 

2291
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,370
PIECES OF TREES, PIECES OF -- 

2292
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:59,374
SMALL, LARGE, ALL SIZES. 

2293
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:01,276
AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY WE'LL HAVE TO 

2294
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:05,447
MAKE A DETERMINED TATIAN -- 

2295
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:09,451
DETERMINATION AS THINGS 

2296
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:09,785
PROGRESS. 

2297
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:10,819
>> YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE PIECES 

2298
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,054
OF THE HOTEL. 

2299
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:15,056
WHAT IS BEEN THE CONCERN WHEN 

2300
01:18:15,056 --> 01:18:16,291
YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS IN THAT 

2301
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:16,491
AREA? 

2302
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:17,058
WHAT'S THE BIG CONCERN? 

2303
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:18,460
>> THE MAIN CONCERN THAT THE 

2304
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,795
LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES HAD 

2305
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,997
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CHOSE TO STAY

2306
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:25,867
AND DIDN'T EVACUATE AND THERE 

2307
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:26,668
HAVE BEEN SHELTERS THAT HAVE 

2308
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,404
AND SET UP FOR THOSE PEOPLE, 

2309
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:30,238
THEY ARE CLEARLY PEOPLE WHO 

2310
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,743
DIDN'T HEED THE WARNINGS. RIGHT 

2311
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:35,544
BEFORE THINGS REALLY PICKED UP, 

2312
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,778
WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK 

2313
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:42,551
WITH THE POLICE CHIEF OF PANAMA 

2314
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:42,884
CITY BEACH. 

2315
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,553
HE SAID I CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO 

2316
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:44,986
LEAVE THEIR HOMES. 

2317
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,755
AT A CERTAIN POINT , HE HAS TO 

2318
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:47,422
PROTECT HIS OWN FORCE. 

2319
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,192
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

2320
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:51,726
>> WE DID SEE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 

2321
01:18:51,726 --> 01:18:55,230
SAY AT A CERTAIN POINT, WE MAY 

2322
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,464
NOT BE ABLE TO COME AND SAVE 

2323
01:18:56,464 --> 01:18:57,132
YOU. 

2324
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,100
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR 

2325
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,503
CONVEYED AS WELL. 

2326
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:02,137
>> UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR 

2327
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:03,438
HAS A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE 

2328
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,372
DEALING WITH HURRICANES AND 

2329
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:11,079
GETTING THE WORD OUT. 

2330
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,214
WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING OVER 

2331
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:13,115
THE LAST FEW HOURS? 

2332
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:14,182
>> Reporter: WELL, HE HAS BEEN 

2333
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:15,350
TRYING TO EMPHASIZE HOW SERIOUS 

2334
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:16,451
THIS IS AND HOW SERIOUS PEOPLE 

2335
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,119
SHOULD TAKE THIS. 

2336
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,654
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A STORM -- 

2337
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:22,958
THE MAGNITUDE IS ONE THAT THIS 

2338
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,126
PART OF FLORIDA HASN'T SEEN OR 

2339
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:26,528
EXPERIENCED IN AT LEAST A 

2340
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:26,795
CENTURY. 

2341
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:30,632
HE MADE THAT CLEAR. 

2342
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,033
AND I THINK WHAT SURPRISED US 

2343
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,168
ALL IS THE INTENSITY OF THE 

2344
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:33,434
STORM. 

2345
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:35,337
THIS CAME ASHORE AT 155 MILES 

2346
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:37,072
PER HOUR. 

2347
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:40,141
THAT'S JUST SHY OF A CATEGORY 5.

2348
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:41,809
TO WATCH HOW RAPIDLY IT PICKED 

2349
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:45,046
UP IN STRENGTH, I THINK IT IS 

2350
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:45,346
REMARKABLE. 

2351
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:47,282
>> WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE? 

2352
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:51,119
AS WE'RE WATCHING WE SAW THE 

2353
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:58,260
CAMERA GEAR MOVING AROUND. 

2354
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,527
HOW DID IT DETERIORATE TO FORCE 

2355
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:01,229
YOU TO SEEK SHELTER INSIDE OF 

2356
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,097
THE HOTEL? 

2357
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:06,268
>> Reporter: AGAIN, THIS WAS AT 

2358
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:07,435
THE CLIMAX OF THE STORM, RIGHT 

2359
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:10,171
AS IT WAS COMING ASHORE AND 

2360
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:11,306
MAKING LANDFALL. 

2361
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,173
THAT'S WHERE THE STRONGEST 

2362
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:12,607
WINDS ARE. 

2363
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:13,975
IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO 

2364
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:14,208
STAND. 

2365
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:17,078
WE CONTINUED TO SEE -- DURING 

2366
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,147
THE SHOT, WE POINTED OUT A ROOF 

2367
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:26,354
THAT WAS COMING APART AT A SHOP.

2368
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:27,589
BEING OUT IN THOSE CONDITIONS, 

2369
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:28,757
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BE 

2370
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,493
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. 

2371
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,661
THAT'S WHY WE MADE THE CALL 

2372
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,462
THAT EVEN AS SOON AS WE CAME IN 

2373
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,463
AND BROUGHT THE GEAR IN, THE 

2374
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:38,266
DOOR LEADING OUTSIDE KEPT 

2375
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:38,867
BLOWING OPEN. 

2376
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,670
IT LITERALLY TOOK OUR CREW AND 

2377
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,506
THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE MANNING 

2378
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,142
THE HOTEL TO TIE THE DOOR DOWN 

2379
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:53,348
AND KEEP IT SHUT. 

2380
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,449
WE WERE THINKING WE WERE 

2381
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:55,650
SEEKING SHELTER ONE REALLY WE 

2382
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,185
WERE ONCE AGAIN EXPOSED TO MORE 

2383
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,186
RISK. 

2384
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,454
INCREDIBLE. 

2385
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:01,356
NICOLE KILLIAN, I'M GLAD YOU 

2386
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,360
ARE SAFE. 

2387
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,394
THANK YOU. 

2388
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:07,095
>> YOU ARE WELCOME. 

2389
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:10,198
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN OMAR 

2390
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,433
VILLAFRANCA. 

2391
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,401
HE JOINS US FROM PORT ST. JOE 

2392
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:14,035
IN FLORIDA. 

2393
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,637
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 

2394
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:16,104
EXPERIENCING. 

2395
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:17,339
>> Reporter: RIGHT NOW WE ARE 

2396
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,741
STARTING TO GET ON THE BACKSIDE 

2397
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,443
OF THE BANDS OF HURRICANE 

2398
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:22,177
MICHAEL.  

2399
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,779
WE SAW PLENTY OF WIND AS THE 

2400
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:27,515
SYSTEM WAS MOVING ON TO SHORE. 

2401
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:33,488
WE SAW TOLD -- TALL PINE TREES 

2402
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:33,988
THAT WERE BENDING OVER 

2403
01:21:33,988 --> 01:21:34,255
SIDEWAYS. 

2404
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:36,791
WE SAW TREES SNAP AND PIECES OF 

2405
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:39,627
BUILDINGS COMING OFF. 

2406
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:41,329
THE POWER IS OUT IN THIS AREA. 

2407
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:46,067
THAT'S GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY 

2408
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,469
SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 

2409
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:48,136
HAVE TO DEAL WITH. 

2410
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,871
AND MAYBE EVEN LONGER. 

2411
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:50,971
STORM SURGE IS ALWAYS THE BIG 

2412
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:51,639
CONCERN. 

2413
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:52,707
PEOPLE ARE STAYING OFF THE 

2414
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:52,940
ROADS. 

2415
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,042
THAT'S A GOOD NEWS. 

2416
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,811
THE BAD NEWS IS THE STORM SURGE 

2417
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:59,547
CAME WITH FURY. 

2418
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:01,249
WE SOUGHT WATER ON THE ROAD 

2419
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,550
THAT WAS A FEW INCHES RISE UP 

2420
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,220
TO ALMOST 2 FEET. IT WAS MOVING 

2421
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:09,024
VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 

2422
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,191
WE LITERALLY PARKED TO GET SOME 

2423
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:11,292
SHOTS OF VIDEO AND IT WAS 

2424
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:13,428
RISING UP VERY FAST. 

2425
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,563
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 

2426
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:15,930
HUNKERED DOWN. 

2427
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,966
THERE WAS AN EVACUATION ORDER 

2428
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:21,202
IN THE AREA. 

2429
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,371
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAY 

2430
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:26,007
ABOUT 60% -- MORE THAN HALF OF 

2431
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:29,010
THE PEOPLE HERE BASICALLY ARE 

2432
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,478
GATHERING SUPPLIES AND WERE 

2433
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,847
HUNKERING DOWN. 

2434
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,049
THERE IS A SMALL LITTLE HOTEL 

2435
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:34,382
AROUND HERE. 

2436
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:36,284
THE PARKING LOT IS PACKED. IT 

2437
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:39,154
IS A LOT OF LOCALS WHO WERE AT 

2438
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:40,522
VACATION HOMES OR HOMES NEAR 

2439
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:41,289
THE WATER. 

2440
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,290
THEY DECIDED TO COME FURTHER 

2441
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,758
INLAND JUST IN CASE. 

2442
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:47,929
THEY ARE FOR MILLER -- VERY 

2443
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:51,866
FAMILIAR WITH STORM SURGE. 

2444
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:52,500
WAIT THAT'S INTERESTING THAT 

2445
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,534
60% OF PEOPLE DECIDED TO STAY. 

2446
01:22:53,534 --> 01:23:00,008
>> Reporter: YES. 

2447
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:00,909
THAT WAS SOMETHING THE 

2448
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:01,743
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WAS NOT 

2449
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,211
GOING TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND 

2450
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:04,446
TELL THEM TO LEAVE EVEN THOUGH 

2451
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:05,113
IT WAS MANDATORY. 

2452
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:06,214
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MANPOWER. 

2453
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:07,315
IT IS ALMOST -- THOSE PEOPLE 

2454
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,417
AREN'T THEIR OWN RISK. 

2455
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,920
THE AMBULANCES ARE INLAND. 

2456
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,288
ONE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS 

2457
01:23:14,288 --> 01:23:16,057
WAS OUT THERE SERVING SOME OF 

2458
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:23,598
THE DAMAGE BEFORE THE EYE HIT. 

2459
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:24,733
HE BASICALLY SAID IF ANYBODY 

2460
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:25,967
HAS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AT THIS 

2461
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:27,135
POINT, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 

2462
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:29,337
TO WAIT UNTIL THE HURRICANE 

2463
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:30,038
PASSES. 

2464
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:31,606
THAT IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THEY 

2465
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:32,106
TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE. 

2466
01:23:32,106 --> 01:23:35,376
IF YOU NEED HELP, IT'S NOT 

2467
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:36,177
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. 

2468
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,344
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR 

2469
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,645
HAT. 

2470
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:38,513
OMAR VILLAFRANCA, THANK YOU 

2471
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,280
VERY MUCH. 

2472
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,617
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

2473
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:42,850
BREAK. 

2474
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:46,221
WE HAVE MUCH MORE NEWS TO GET 

2475
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:46,588
TO. 

2476
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:47,655
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

2477
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:57,132
MONITOR HURRICANE MICHAEL.  

2478
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:44,305
>>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU NOT TO 

2479
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:47,408
COVERAGE FROM WCTV  FOR MORE ON 

2480
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:48,376
THE STORM. 

2481
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,879
>> HERE YOU SEE SOME OF THE 

2482
01:25:51,879 --> 01:25:56,217
WINDS JUST HITTING THE TREES IN 

2483
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:57,552
TALLAHASSEE NEAR THE CAPITAL 

2484
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:58,553
DOWNTOWN. 

2485
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:02,023
THIS IS WHAT CAUSES THE PROBLEMS

2486
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:03,691
. SOME OF THESE TREES COME DOWN 

2487
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,460
ON POWER LINES AND KNOCK OUT 

2488
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,596
THE POWER AS THE NUMBERS 

2489
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:09,997
CONTINUE TO RISE AND THAT WIND 

2490
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:12,367
DRIVEN RAIN IS BEING HEARD ON 

2491
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:14,202
THE ROOF OF THE STATION AGAIN 

2492
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:14,935
RIGHT NOW. 

2493
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:16,638
IT SEEMS LIKE IT GETS LOUDER 

2494
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:18,840
AND STRONGER AND THE WINDS GET 

2495
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,076
STRONGER AS WELL. 

2496
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:25,380
>> TREES ARE REMARKABLY 

2497
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,047
FLEXIBLE BUT WHEN YOU'RE 

2498
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:27,448
TALKING ABOUT WINDS IN EXCESS S 

2499
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:28,750
OF 50, 70 MILES PER HOUR, THERE 

2500
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:32,887
IS A LIMIT TO THAT. 

2501
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,923
TALLAHASSEE IS KNOWN FOR ITS 

2502
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:35,523
BEAUTIFUL TREES. 

2503
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,425
THIS IS THE TOUGH PART OF THAT. 

2504
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:39,027
>> WE ALWAYS LOVE THE TREES IN 

2505
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,762
TALLAHASSEE THAT THEY DO TEND 

2506
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:44,866
TO CAUSE A PROBLEM WHEN 

2507
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:45,933
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS KICK UP. 

2508
01:26:45,933 --> 01:26:48,403
>> I THINK  THE GOOD NEWS IS 

2509
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:50,438
AFTER HURRICAE HERMINE WE 

2510
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:57,278
LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS ON HOW 

2511
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:57,679
TO RESPOND. 

2512
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,813
THERE CREWS THAT ARE WAITING TO 

2513
01:26:58,813 --> 01:26:59,447
GET TO WORK. 

2514
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:01,749
THE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION IS 

2515
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:02,750
MINUTE TO MINUTE. 

2516
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,619
I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT FROM 

2517
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:06,087
THAT STORM AND HOPEFULLY THE 

2518
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:08,056
RESPONSE THIS TIME AROUND TO 

2519
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,257
WHAT IS SURE TO BE LOTS OF 

2520
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:13,061
DOWNED TREES AND POWER LINES IS 

2521
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:13,461
QUICK. 

2522
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,029
>> LET'S TAKE A LIVE LOOK 

2523
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:23,304
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.  THIS IS OUR 

2524
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:24,205
TOWER CAMERA AT WCTV. 

2525
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:25,440
YOU CAN SEE THE I-10 FLYOVER. 

2526
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,074
IT'S VERY QUIET.  

2527
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,908
THERE IS MAYBE ONE CAR IN THE 

2528
01:27:27,908 --> 01:27:28,543
DISTANCE. 

2529
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:29,310
PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY STAYING 

2530
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:32,647
INSIDE AND STAYING HUNKERED 

2531
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:33,147
INSIDE. 

2532
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,349
YOU CAN SEE THE CAMERA SHAKING 

2533
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:36,084

SO, WE HAVE TAKEN SOME 

2537
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:48,663
INCREDIBLE POWER HEADS AT THE 

2538

STATION. 

2539
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:49,564
THE LIGHTS ARE FLICKERING. 

2540
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:50,898
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON.

PENSACOLA. 

2549
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,245
THIS IS CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR 

2550
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:04,478
PEOPLE. 

2551
01:28:04,478 --> 01:28:06,080
IT'S HUGE. 

2552
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,683

HURRICANE TO MAKE LANDFALL 

2555
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:17,825
ALONG THE GULF COAST IN FLORIDA.

2556
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:20,395

2571
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:51,492

I CAN'T SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE

01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:03,724
COMING IN, AND IT LOOKS LIKE 

2893
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,526
WE'VE GOT SEVEN .4 FEET 

2894
01:41:05,526 --> 01:41:08,495
INUNDATION IN APPALACHIA, SO 

2895
01:41:08,495 --> 01:41:09,796
THE STORM SURGE COMING IN WITH 

2896
01:41:09,796 --> 01:41:10,764
A VENGEANCE, AND EVEN THOUGH 

2897
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:18,172
THE SYSTEM IS INLAND, YOU CAN 

2898
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:19,239
STILL HAVE THAT ONSHORE FLOW 

2899
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:20,440
PUSHING THE WATER IN, SO JUST 

2900
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,375
BECAUSE THE STORM IS INLAND, 

2901
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:22,810
YOU ARE STILL NOT OUT OF DANGER 

2902
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:23,977
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT STORM 

2903
01:41:23,977 --> 01:41:24,244
SURGE. 

2904
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,679
WE WERE FORFEIT -- WE WILL 

2905
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:26,647
CONTINUE TO FORECAST 14 FEET IN 

2906
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:28,248
AREAS FROM TYNDALL AIR FORCE 

2907
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:28,915
BASE, THAT'S INUNDATION, NINE 

2908
01:41:28,915 --> 01:41:33,987
FOOT TO 14 FOOT ABOVE GROUND 

2909
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:36,056
WAVES ON TOP OF IT, AND SOME OF 

2910
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:37,057
THE IMAGES WE ARE SEEING, YOU 

2911
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:38,559
CAN SEE THE WATER COME IN, AND 

2912
01:41:38,559 --> 01:41:39,793
ON TOP THERE IS THE DAMAGING 

2913
01:41:39,793 --> 01:41:40,661
WAVES THAT CAN CAUSE STRUCTURL 

2914
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:42,963
DAMAGE AS WELL. 

2915
01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:43,964
GETTING TRAPPED IN THESE 

2916
01:41:43,964 --> 01:41:45,431
POCKETS, THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF 

2917
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:45,833
 

2918
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:49,670
WELL AWAY FROM THE CENTER, YOU 

2919
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,437
ARE STILL NOT SAFE. 

2920
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:51,638
THERE'S ELEVATED VALUES, 6 TO 9 

2921
01:41:51,638 --> 01:41:53,006
FOOT ABOVE GROUND ALL THE WAY 

2922
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:54,308
TO CEDAR KEY, AND AS FAR AS 

2923
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:55,809
TAMPA 2 TO 4 FEET ABOVE GROUND. 

2924
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:57,277
THAT IS NOT ON THE COAST, YOU 

2925
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:58,512
CAN SEE SOME OF THE STORM SURGE 

2926
01:41:58,512 --> 01:41:59,546
GOES INLAND AS THE WINDS 

2927
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:02,182
CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT WATER 

2928
01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:03,784
FURTHER INLAND. 

2929
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:04,985
THIS HAS BEEN KEN GRAHAM WITH 

2930
01:42:04,985 --> 01:42:06,353
THE UPDATES ON A DANGEROUS AND 

2931
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:07,187
POWERFUL HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

2932
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:14,461
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

2933
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:15,462
>>> NICOLE KILLIAN IN PANAMA 

2934
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:16,597
CITY BEACH ON THE PHONE, NICOLE 

2935
01:42:16,597 --> 01:42:17,030
JOINS US. 

2936
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,998
EARLIER, YOUR CREW WAS WORKING 

2937
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:19,499
TO KEEP UP THE GEAR, WE SEE 

2938
01:42:19,499 --> 01:42:20,667
FROM YOUR LIVE SHOT THOSE TREES 

2939
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:21,868
BLOWING IN THE WIND, TELL US 

2940
01:42:21,868 --> 01:42:23,637
WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT 

2941
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:24,238
NOW. 

2942
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:25,272
>> Reporter: AT THIS POINT, 

2943
01:42:25,272 --> 01:42:27,507
WE'VE TAKEN SHELTER IN A HOTEL 

2944
01:42:27,507 --> 01:42:28,675
WHERE WE ARE STAYING, NOT TOO 

2945
01:42:28,675 --> 01:42:30,243
LONG AFTER WE DID THAT LIVE 

2946
01:42:30,243 --> 01:42:32,112
SHOT. 

2947
01:42:32,112 --> 01:42:33,714
WE HAD COME IN BECAUSE, AT THAT 

2948
01:42:33,714 --> 01:42:34,581
POINT, THE STORM WAS MAKING 

2949
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:35,682
LANDFALL, AS THE RAIN AND WIND 

2950
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:37,317
REALLY GOT INTENSE, AT TIMES 

2951
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:41,321
YOU COULD SEE LITERALLY A WALL 

2952
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:45,626
OF WATER PASS THROUGH, AND THAT 

2953
01:42:45,626 --> 01:42:47,060
TRADITIONAL CLASSIC SOUND OF A 

2954
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:49,061
TRAIN THAT YOU HEAR WITH STRONG 

2955
01:42:49,061 --> 01:42:51,631
WINDS GUSTING THROUGH, SO WE 

2956
01:42:51,631 --> 01:42:54,034
HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT, MAYBE 

2957
01:42:54,034 --> 01:42:58,905
THAT'S TOO CASUAL A TERM, HERE 

2958
01:42:58,905 --> 01:43:00,040
IN THE HOTEL, WE HAVE LOST 

2959
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,175
POWER, EVEN SOME PARTS OF THE 

2960
01:43:02,175 --> 01:43:04,044
HOTEL ARE STARTING TO COME 

2961
01:43:04,044 --> 01:43:05,111
APART AS WELL, SOME OF THE 

2962
01:43:05,111 --> 01:43:06,213
CEILING TILES HAVE COME DOWN, 

2963
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:08,382
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME LEAKS 

2964
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:09,483
COMING FROM THE CEILING, THERE 

2965
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:14,855
ARE OTHER MEDIA HERE AS WELL, 

2966
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:15,922
BUT HE IS TRYING TO NAVIGATE 

2967
01:43:15,922 --> 01:43:17,491
THE SITUATION AS BEST WE CAN. 

2968
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:18,325
IT APPEARS AT THIS POINT THAT 

2969
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:21,161
SOME OF THE WIND HAS STARTED TO 

2970
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:22,596
DIE DOWN, BUT WE KNOW WE ARE 

2971
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:25,465
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET. 

2972
01:43:25,465 --> 01:43:26,933
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU 

2973
01:43:26,933 --> 01:43:28,235
AND THE CREW WILL HAVE TO TAKE 

2974
01:43:28,235 --> 01:43:29,136
SHELTER AT THIS POINT? 

2975
01:43:29,136 --> 01:43:31,471
>> Reporter: I WOULD THINK FOR 

2976
01:43:31,471 --> 01:43:35,475
AT LEAST THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO, 

2977
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:36,676
UNTIL THESE CONDITIONS IMPROVE, 

2978
01:43:36,676 --> 01:43:38,478
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL DEBRIS 

2979
01:43:38,478 --> 01:43:42,782
BLOWING AROUND OUT THERE, AT 

2980
01:43:42,782 --> 01:43:43,984
THE LIVE POSITION WHERE WE 

2981
01:43:43,984 --> 01:43:45,185
WERE, WE JUST SAW, AS I 

2982
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:45,919
MENTIONED, A WALL OF WATER 

2983
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:48,488
COMING THROUGH, AND THE GRASSY 

2984
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:50,023
SPACE BEHIND US FILLED UP WITH 

2985
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:50,523
WATER. 

2986
01:43:50,523 --> 01:43:52,125
SOME OF THAT HAS RECEDED, BUT 

2987
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:54,494
AGAIN, I'M LOOKING RIGHT NOW AT 

2988
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:57,497
ALL TYPES OF DEBRIS THAT IS ON 

2989
01:43:57,497 --> 01:44:04,304
THE GROUND, PIECES OF TREES, 

2990
01:44:04,304 --> 01:44:07,240
SMALL, LARGE, ALL SIZES. 

2991
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,875
OBVIOUSLY WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE 

2992
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:13,747
A DETERMINATION AS THINGS 

2993
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:14,014
PROGRESS. 

2994
01:44:14,014 --> 01:44:14,948
>> REMARKABLE TO HEAR THAT. 

2995
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:16,783
YOU CAN SEE PIECES OF THAT 

2996
01:44:16,783 --> 01:44:20,053
HOTEL COMING APART, WHAT HAS 

2997
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:20,687
BEEN THE CONCERN WHEN YOU TALK 

2998
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:21,788
TO OFFICIALS IN THAT AREA? 

2999
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:22,923
WHAT'S THE BIG CONCERN AT THIS 

3000
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:23,156
POINT? 

3001
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:24,258
>> Reporter: A COUPLE OF 

3002
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,325
THINGS, THE MAIN CONCERN THAT 

3003
01:44:25,325 --> 01:44:27,594
THE LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES 

3004
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,029
HAD FOR PEOPLE THAT CHOSE TO 

3005
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:32,332
RIDE OUT THE STORM AND DIDN'T 

3006
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:33,400
EVACUATE, AND THERE HAVE BEEN 

3007
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,268
SHELTERS THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP 

3008
01:44:35,268 --> 01:44:37,137
FOR THOSE FOLKS, BUT THERE ARE 

3009
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:38,705
CLEARLY FOLKS WHO DIDN'T HEED 

3010
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:41,074
THOSE WARNINGS, RIGHT BEFORE 

3011
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:42,409
THINGS PICKED UP, WE HAD AN 

3012
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:46,213
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE 

3013
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:47,948
POLICE CHIEF OF PANAMA CITY 

3014
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,016
BEACH, AND HE SAID, I CAN'T 

3015
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,117
FORCE PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR 

3016
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:51,251
HOMES, AT A CERTAIN POINT IN 

3017
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:54,087
TIME, HE HAS TO PROTECT HIS OWN 

3018
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:55,889
FORCE. 

3019
01:44:55,889 --> 01:45:01,128
WE DID SEE THE LOCAL 

3020
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:02,129
AUTHORITIES SAY AT A CERTAIN 

3021
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:03,764
POINT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO 

3022
01:45:03,764 --> 01:45:04,998
COME OUT AND SAVE YOU, THAT'S 

3023
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:05,966
THE MESSAGE THAT THE GOVERNOR 

3024
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,267
CONVEYED AS WELL, UNTIL 

3025
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:09,703
CONDITIONS IMPROVE. 

3026
01:45:09,703 --> 01:45:11,438
>> GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT HAS A 

3027
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:12,139
GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE 

3028
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,507
DEALING WITH HURRICANES AND 

3029
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:14,174
GETTING HURRICANES THAT SMACKED 

3030
01:45:14,174 --> 01:45:15,608
THE WORD OUT, WHAT HAS HE BEEN 

3031
01:45:15,608 --> 01:45:16,710
SAYING OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS? 

3032
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:18,879
>> Reporter: HE HAS BEEN TRYING 

3033
01:45:18,879 --> 01:45:20,080
TO EMPHASIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS 

3034
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,214
IS, AND HOW SERIOUS PEOPLE 

3035
01:45:22,214 --> 01:45:27,821
SHOULD TAKE THIS, OBVIOUSLY THIS

3036
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:29,289
IS A STORM, THE MAGNITUDE OF 

3037
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:31,124
THIS STORM IS ONE OF THIS PART 

3038
01:45:31,124 --> 01:45:33,193
OF FLORIDA HASN'T SEEN OR 

3039
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,461
EXPERIENCED IN AT LEAST A 

3040
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:35,695
CENTURY, HE MADE THAT CLEAR, I 

3041
01:45:35,695 --> 01:45:38,665
THINK WHAT SURPRISED US ALL IS 

3042
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:40,934
THE INTENSITY OF THE STORM, 

3043
01:45:40,934 --> 01:45:42,102
THIS CAME ASHORE AT 155 MILES 

3044
01:45:42,102 --> 01:45:46,173
PER HOUR , JUST SHY OF CATEGORY 

3045
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,474
FIVE. 

3046
01:45:47,474 --> 01:45:48,642
TO WATCH HOW RAPIDLY IT PICKED 

3047
01:45:48,642 --> 01:45:51,311
UP IN STRENGTH, I THINK IT WAS 

3048
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:55,382
JUST REMARKABLE. 

3049
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:56,450
>> WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE? 

3050
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,751
AS WE WERE WATCHING YOU, WE 

3051
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:59,152
SAW, AS I MENTIONED, WHAT 

3052
01:45:59,152 --> 01:45:59,886
APPEARED TO BE YOUR CAMERA GEAR 

3053
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:01,221
MOVING AROUND, YOUR PRODUCER 

3054
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:02,189
STEPPING IN TO MAKE SURE IT 

3055
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,324
WASN'T HITTING YOU, HOW DID IT 

3056
01:46:04,324 --> 01:46:07,227
DETERIORATE TO FORCE YOU TO 

3057
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:08,929
SEEK SHELTER INSIDE THE HOTEL? 

3058
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:17,204
>> Reporter: THIS WAS AT THE 

3059
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:18,438
CLIMAX OF THE STORM, RIGHT AS 

3060
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:19,706
IT WAS COMING ASHORE AND MAKING 

3061
01:46:19,706 --> 01:46:20,774
LANDFALL, AND AS YOU KNOW, 

3062
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:21,708
THAT'S WERE THE STRONGEST WINDS 

3063
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:23,009
ARE, IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE 

3064
01:46:23,009 --> 01:46:24,144
IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO 

3065
01:46:24,144 --> 01:46:25,078
STAND, WE CONTINUED TO SEE 

3066
01:46:25,078 --> 01:46:26,479
DURING THE SHOT, WE POINTED OUT 

3067
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:27,747
A ROOF THAT WAS COMING APART, 

3068
01:46:27,747 --> 01:46:33,387
AD AN AUTO BODY SHOP, AND 

3069
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:34,320
BEING OUT IN THOSE CONDITIONS, 

3070
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,722
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE 

3071
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:39,059
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, THAT'S 

3072
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:40,327
WHY WE MADE THE CALL, EVEN AS 

3073
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:41,762
SOON AS WE CAME IN AND BROUGHT 

3074
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:42,963
ALL OUR GEAR IN, THE DOOR 

3075
01:46:42,963 --> 01:46:44,898
LEADING OUTSIDE KEPT BLOWING 

3076
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:49,703
OPEN, SO IT TOOK OUR CREW, AND 

3077
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:50,804
THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE MANNING 

3078
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:56,910
THIS HOTEL FOR US TO TRY TO TIE 

3079
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,044
THE DOOR DOWN AND KEEP IT SHUT 

3080
01:46:58,044 --> 01:46:59,513
SO THAT WE DIDN'T GET THOSE 

3081
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:00,414
GUEST COMING INTO THE HALLWAY. 

3082
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:01,715
THINKING THAT WE WERE SEEKING 

3083
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:02,582
SHELTER, WHEN REALLY WE WERE, 

3084
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:06,553
ONCE AGAIN, EXPOSED. 

3085
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:08,021
>> I'M GLAD YOU AND THE CREW 

3086
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:09,456
ARE SAFE AND SEEKING SHELTER 

3087
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:10,924
RIGHT NOW, WE WILL CHECK BACK 

3088
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:11,958
WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON, THANK 

3089
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:12,626
YOU. 

3090
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:16,663
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 

3091
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:18,265
>> I'M TONYA RIVERO, JOINED BY

01:47:18,732 --> 01:47:19,799
METEOROLOGIST JEFF BARRETT 

3094
01:47:19,799 --> 01:47:20,433
ELLIE. 

3095
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:23,970
JEFF, GET US UP TO SPEED. 

3096
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:24,971
WE KNOW THAT HURRICANE MICHAEL 

3097
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:26,907
IS A CATEGORY FOUR, AND JUST 

3098
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:35,181
MADE LANDFALL. 

3099
01:47:35,181 --> 01:47:35,781
>> Reporter: IT BLIP MADE 

3100
01:47:35,781 --> 01:47:36,917
LANDFALL WITH WINDS OF 155 

3101
01:47:36,917 --> 01:47:37,951
MILES PER HOUR, TO BE CATEGORY 

3102
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,152
FIVE, THE WINDS WOULD'VE HAD TO 

3103
01:47:39,152 --> 01:47:40,654
BE 156 MILES PER HOUR, SO THAT 

3104
01:47:40,654 --> 01:47:41,988
A COUPLE MORE MINUTES OVER THE 

3105
01:47:41,988 --> 01:47:42,988
WATER, IT WOULD BE A CATEGORY 

3106
01:47:42,988 --> 01:47:43,590
FIVE.  

3107
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:44,524
BUT FOR ALL INTENTS AND 

3108
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:45,425
PURPOSES, THIS WAS A 

3109
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:45,992
LANDFALLING CATEGORY FIVE 

3110
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:46,292
HURRICANE. 

3111
01:47:46,292 --> 01:47:47,294
>> ARE WE ENTERING UNCHARTED 

3112
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:47,661
TERRITORY HERE? 

3113
01:47:47,661 --> 01:47:48,595
PUT THIS STORM INTO PERSPECTIVE 

3114
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:49,796
FOR US, IN A HISTORICAL WAY. 

3115
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,331
>> IT'S EITHER THE 3rd OR 4th 

3116
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:52,032
STRONGEST HURRICANE ON RECORD 

3117
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:54,568
IN THE U.S.  3rd IF YOU LOOK AT 

3118
01:47:54,568 --> 01:47:57,003
PRESSURE, 4th IF YOU LOOK AT 

3119
01:47:57,003 --> 01:47:58,538
WIND,  SO THIS IS A STRONG 

3120
01:47:58,538 --> 01:47:59,472
HURRICANE, IT'S THE KIND OF 

3121
01:47:59,472 --> 01:48:00,473
HURRICANE THAT HAPPENS ONCE 

3122
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:05,311
EVERY 25 YEARS OR SO ON AVERAGE,

3123
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:06,813
AND A LOT OF THE BUILDINGS IN 

3124
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:08,014
FLORIDA UNTESTED FOR WINS THIS 

3125
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:08,247
STRONG. 

3126
01:48:08,247 --> 01:48:09,215
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

3127
01:48:09,215 --> 01:48:10,250
BUILDING CODE, BECAUSE 

3128
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:12,419
HURRICANE ANDREW SET THE 

3129
01:48:12,419 --> 01:48:13,353
BUILDING CODE FOR A CATEGORY 

3130
01:48:13,353 --> 01:48:24,197
THREE, IS THAT RIGHT? 

3131
01:48:24,197 --> 01:48:25,331
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 

3132
01:48:25,331 --> 01:48:26,099
>> AFTER HURRICANE ANDREW, 

3133
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:26,800
THERE WAS DEVASTATION. 

3134
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,101
I WAS TELLING YOU BEFORE THE 

3135
01:48:28,101 --> 01:48:28,969
PEOPLE WOULD RETURN TO THEIR 

3136
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:30,203
HOME AND NOT KNOW WHERE THEIR 

3137
01:48:30,203 --> 01:48:31,071
HOME WAS, EVERYTHING WAS 

3138
01:48:31,071 --> 01:48:31,838
OBLITERATED, THERE WERE NO 

3139
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:32,138
LANDMARKS. 

3140
01:48:32,138 --> 01:48:32,839
AFTER THAT, MIAMI-DADE DECIDED 

3141
01:48:32,839 --> 01:48:34,074
TO PUT TOGETHER A BUILDING CODE 

3142
01:48:34,074 --> 01:48:35,208
THAT ENSURED THAT PEOPLE BUILD 

3143
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:36,176
THEIR HOUSES UP THE CATEGORY 

3144
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:36,610
THREE STANDARD. 

3145
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:37,577
ANY HOMES AFTER THE MID-90s 

3146
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:38,311
WERE BUILT TO WITHSTAND 

3147
01:48:38,311 --> 01:48:38,744
CATEGORY THREE. 

3148
01:48:38,744 --> 01:48:39,846
THIS WAS A BORDERLINE CATEGORY 

3149
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:40,914
FIVE, SO A LOT OF THE 

3150
01:48:40,914 --> 01:48:45,952
STRUCTURES AND FLORIDA UNTESTED.

3151
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,153
THERE WERE PLENTY OF HOMES 

3152
01:48:47,153 --> 01:48:48,321
AROUND THE PANAMA CITY AREA 

3153
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:49,089
THAT ARE NOT BILLED FOR 

3154
01:48:49,089 --> 01:48:50,023
CATEGORY THREE, BECAUSE THEY 

3155
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:51,224
WERE BUILT BEFORE THAT, OR THEY 

3156
01:48:51,224 --> 01:48:51,825
ARE MOBILE HOMES. 

3157
01:48:51,825 --> 01:48:53,326
WE ARE IN A SITUATION HERE 

3158
01:48:53,326 --> 01:48:54,327
WHERE WE WON'T GET AWAY WITHOUT 

3159
01:48:54,327 --> 01:48:56,496
DEVASTATING LOSSES IN TERMS OF 

3160
01:48:56,496 --> 01:48:57,030
THE HOUSES. 

3161
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:58,565
>> AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY 1ST-

3162
01:48:58,565 --> 01:48:59,633
HAND REPORTS, IT'S TOO EARLY TO 

3163
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:00,900
KNOW  EXACTLY WHAT IT LOOKS 

3164
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:01,133
LIKE. 

3165
01:49:01,133 --> 01:49:03,637
>> I'VE SEEN SOME VIDEO, FROM 

3166
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:05,238
WHAT I SAW IT WAS LOCATED ON 

3167
01:49:05,238 --> 01:49:08,308
THE BEACH AROUND PORT SAINT JOE.

3168
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:10,910
DEVASTATION. 

3169
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:12,211
I COULDN'T TELL IF THAT WAS 

3170
01:49:12,211 --> 01:49:20,120
FROM WIND OR WATER. 

3171
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,187
I KNOW THAT AT LAST CHECK, 

3172
01:49:21,187 --> 01:49:22,489
WATER LEVELS WERE A GOOD SIX, 

3173
01:49:22,489 --> 01:49:23,423
SEVEN, MAYBE EIGHT FEET ABOVE 

3174
01:49:23,423 --> 01:49:24,257
NORMAL IN APALACHICOLA, WHICH 

3175
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:25,759
IS FAR EAST OF WHERE THE CENTER 

3176
01:49:25,759 --> 01:49:26,192
MADE LANDFALL. 

3177
01:49:26,192 --> 01:49:27,494
IT'S A COMBINATION OF WIND AND 

3178
01:49:27,494 --> 01:49:28,728
WATER ON THE BEACH, I SAW A 

3179
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:29,095
RUBBLE. 

3180
01:49:29,095 --> 01:49:30,997
>> TELL US, HOW DO YOU BUILD A 

3181
01:49:30,997 --> 01:49:34,600
CATEGORY THREE BUILDING THAT 

3182
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,168
CAN WITHSTAND THAT? 

3183
01:49:35,168 --> 01:49:36,336
TO THE NEED TO HAVE STEEL 

3184
01:49:36,336 --> 01:49:36,703
BEAMS? 

3185
01:49:36,703 --> 01:49:40,573
HOW COMPLICATED IS IT? 

3186
01:49:40,573 --> 01:49:41,641
>> YOU NEED CONCRETE BLOCK, THE 

3187
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:42,642
OUTSET OF THE HOUSE, THE 

3188
01:49:42,642 --> 01:49:43,743
FOUNDATION, NEEDS TO BE BUILT 

3189
01:49:43,743 --> 01:49:44,644
ON THE EDGES WITH CONCRETE 

3190
01:49:44,644 --> 01:49:46,079
BLOCK AND YOU NEED TO BE ABLE 

3191
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:47,480
TO STRAP THE ROOF ONTO THE 

3192
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:47,713
HOUSE. 

3193
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:48,782
THE 1st THING THAT GOES IN 

3194
01:49:48,782 --> 01:49:50,150
HURRICANE IS THE ROOF.  

3195
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:51,651
ONCE HER ROOF IS COMPROMISED, 

3196
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:52,485
EVERYTHING IS COMPROMISED. 

3197
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:53,620
IF ONE OF YOUR WINDOWS BLOWS 

3198
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:58,658
IN, AND IT, THE WIND CAN COME 

3199
01:49:58,658 --> 01:49:59,826
IN AND PULL YOUR ROOF OFF, 

3200
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:00,527
UPWARD VERTICALLY, THE WHOLE 

3201
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:02,195
HOUSE CAN BE DESTROYED. 

3202
01:50:02,195 --> 01:50:03,296
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE 

3203
01:50:03,296 --> 01:50:03,896
HURRICANE SHUTTERS, HURRICANE 

3204
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:05,832
PANELS ON YOUR WINDOWS, OR 

3205
01:50:05,832 --> 01:50:06,499
STORM WINDOWS, WHICH PREVENTS 

3206
01:50:06,499 --> 01:50:10,537
THE WIND FROM GETTING IN. 

3207
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:11,905
ONCE THE WIND GETS IN, BLOWS 

3208
01:50:11,905 --> 01:50:13,006
THE ROOF OFF, THEN IT JUST 

3209
01:50:13,006 --> 01:50:13,607
COMPROMISES THE WHOLE 

3210
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:13,907
STRUCTURE. 

3211
01:50:13,907 --> 01:50:15,008
>> WITH A CATEGORY FOUR, WE 

3212
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:16,209
DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN. 

3213
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:25,752
>> WE'VE SEEN EVIDENCE OF IT, 

3214
01:50:25,752 --> 01:50:26,853
WITH THE BUILDINGS, THE WAY WE 

3215
01:50:26,853 --> 01:50:28,722
ARE BUILT TODAY, WE WILL SEE IF 

3216
01:50:28,722 --> 01:50:29,355
THE CATEGORY THREE CODE CAN 

3217
01:50:29,355 --> 01:50:29,989
WITHSTAND CATEGORY FOUR COME 

3218
01:50:29,989 --> 01:50:31,124
ALMOST CATEGORY FIVE. 

3219
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:31,624
IT'S UNLIKELY IN SOME 

3220
01:50:31,624 --> 01:50:32,359
SCENARIOS, ESPECIALLY IF THE 

3221
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:32,759
ROOF GIVES. 

3222
01:50:32,759 --> 01:50:33,994
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE RAIN, 

3223
01:50:33,994 --> 01:50:35,462
WHAT KIND OF RAIN IS THIS AREA 

3224
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:35,695
SEEING. 

3225
01:50:35,695 --> 01:50:36,796
>> THE STORM IS MOVING FAST, 

3226
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,198
BUT THERE WILL BE THE LEAST OF 

3227
01:50:38,198 --> 01:50:39,032
THEIR CONCERNS AND FLORIDA. 

3228
01:50:39,032 --> 01:50:40,834
THE STRONGEST WINDS ARE GETTING 

3229
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:44,637
TO THE GEORGIA BORDER LINE 

3230
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:45,672
RIGHT NOW, ONE THING I 

3231
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:46,806
MENTIONED BEFORE I WANT TO 

3232
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:47,673
MENTION AGAIN, THIS STORM WAS 

3233
01:50:47,673 --> 01:50:48,441
STRENGTHENING IT LANDFALL, 

3234
01:50:48,441 --> 01:50:53,179
WHICH MEANS IT HAS TO STABILIZE 

3235
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:54,247
AND THEN WE CAN. 

3236
01:50:54,247 --> 01:50:54,981
BECAUSE IT HAS A FORWARD 

3237
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:56,182
MOMENTUM IN TERMS OF ITS 

3238
01:50:56,182 --> 01:50:57,083
INTENSITY, IT WILL TAKE LONGER 

3239
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:58,384
FOR IT TO WE CAN, WHICH MEANS 

3240
01:50:58,384 --> 01:50:59,552
IT WILL STAY STRONGER OVER 

3241
01:50:59,552 --> 01:51:02,088
GEORGIA, AND IT'S ABOUT TO MOVE 

3242
01:51:02,088 --> 01:51:03,957
INTO GEORGIA. 

3243
01:51:03,957 --> 01:51:05,525
THE WORST OF IT IN GEORGIA IS 

3244
01:51:05,525 --> 01:51:06,626
GOING TO BE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. 

3245
01:51:06,626 --> 01:51:07,727
>> THAT'S THE RAIN AND THE 

3246
01:51:07,727 --> 01:51:07,927
WIND? 

3247
01:51:07,927 --> 01:51:14,534
>> THAT'S THE RAIN, THE WIND. 

3248
01:51:14,534 --> 01:51:15,769
THEN, AFTER THAT, IT MOVES INTO 

3249
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:16,569
SOUTH CAROLINA AND NORTH 

3250
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:17,537
CAROLINA, THE WORST WILL BE 

3251
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:18,338
OVERNIGHT IN GEORGIA, SOUTH 

3252
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:19,139
CAROLINA AND NORTH CAROLINA 

3253
01:51:19,139 --> 01:51:20,373
TOMORROW, AND THEN OFF THE 

3254
01:51:20,373 --> 01:51:21,007
EASTERN SEABOARD BY FRIDAY 

3255
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:21,274
MORNING. 

3256
01:51:21,274 --> 01:51:22,442
DURING THAT TIME, IT WILL DROP 

3257
01:51:22,442 --> 01:51:24,010
6 TO 9 INCHES OF RAIN IN SOUTH 

3258
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:24,844
CAROLINA AND NORTH CAROLINA 

3259
01:51:24,844 --> 01:51:25,845
INTO THOSE SAME RIVERS THAT 

3260
01:51:25,845 --> 01:51:32,185
WERE SWOLLEN FROM FLORENCE. 

3261
01:51:32,185 --> 01:51:33,086
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T NEED TO 

3262
01:51:33,086 --> 01:51:34,154
DROP MORE RAIN THERE, BUT IT 

3263
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:35,422
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE 

3264
01:51:35,422 --> 01:51:37,023
A WHOLE LOT IN A SHORT PERIOD 

3265
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:37,390
OF TIME. 

3266
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:38,358
>> THEY CAN DEFINITELY EXPECT 

3267
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:39,058
STORM SURGE AS WELL. 

3268
01:51:39,058 --> 01:51:40,326
>> IT'S RIVER FLOODING, THAT 

3269
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:40,894
THEY WILL SEE. 

3270
01:51:40,894 --> 01:51:42,128
THE POOR FOLKS THERE HAVE BEEN 

3271
01:51:42,128 --> 01:51:45,565
THROUGH SO MUCH, THERE'S NO 

3272
01:51:45,565 --> 01:51:46,566
TELLING HOW HIGH THE RIVERS 

3273
01:51:46,566 --> 01:51:47,834
WILL GO, BUT THERE WILL BE 

3274
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:48,868
FLASH FLOODING IN THE 

3275
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:49,168
CAROLINAS. 

3276
01:51:49,168 --> 01:51:50,236
>> THIS STORM CAME ABOUT 

3277
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:51,471
QUICKLY, ARE YOU HEARING THAT 

3278
01:51:51,471 --> 01:51:52,505
EVERYONE WHO NEEDED TO EVACUATE 

3279
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:54,074
WAS ABLE TO DO SO? 

3280
01:51:54,074 --> 01:51:58,812
>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM. 

3281
01:51:58,812 --> 01:51:59,545
COMING FROM FLORIDA, KNOWING 

3282
01:51:59,545 --> 01:52:00,680
PEOPLE THERE, THEY HAVE BEEN 

3283
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:01,314
THROUGH STORMS BEFORE. 

3284
01:52:01,314 --> 01:52:02,182
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY PREDICTED 

3285
01:52:02,182 --> 01:52:03,216
TO BE A CATEGORY ONE, THEN 

3286
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:04,317
CATEGORY TWO, ANYONE WHO WAITED 

3287
01:52:04,317 --> 01:52:08,688
TOO LONG TO MAKE A DECISION, 

3288
01:52:08,688 --> 01:52:09,589
EVEN THOUGH WE THOUGHT THIS 

3289
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:11,491
MIGHT BE A THREE OR FOUR MAJOR 

3290
01:52:11,491 --> 01:52:11,991
HURRICANE WOULD'VE MADE 

3291
01:52:11,991 --> 01:52:12,926
LANDFALL A FEW DAYS AGO, ANYONE 

3292
01:52:12,926 --> 01:52:16,830
WHO WAITED TOO LONG TO EVACUATE

3293
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:18,031
, OR WAS STUBBORN AND SAID I 

3294
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:19,499
DON'T WANT TO EVACUATE, THERE'S 

3295
01:52:19,499 --> 01:52:20,834
A LOT OF PEOPLE I CAN TELL YOU 

3296
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:21,768
FROM EXPERIENCE, A LOT OF 

3297
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:22,735
PEOPLE WHO DID NOT LEAVE. 

3298
01:52:22,735 --> 01:52:23,770
IT HAPPENS IN EVERY STORM, 

3299
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:24,504
PEOPLE THINK THEY'VE BEEN 

3300
01:52:24,504 --> 01:52:26,005
THROUGH A STORM LIKE THIS 

3301
01:52:26,005 --> 01:52:28,041
BEFORE. 

3302
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:29,375
THIS IS THE 3rd STRONGEST STORM 

3303
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:30,477
IN U.S. HISTORY, THEY HAVE NOT 

3304
01:52:30,477 --> 01:52:31,811
EVER BEEN THROUGH A STORM OF 

3305
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:32,979
THIS MAGNITUDE, AND IT WAS A 

3306
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:33,746
STRENGTHENING STORM IT 

3307
01:52:33,746 --> 01:52:34,079
LANDFALL.  

3308
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:34,613
STRENGTHENING STORMS IT 

3309
01:52:34,613 --> 01:52:35,982
LANDFALL PRODUCE A LOT MORE 

3310
01:52:35,982 --> 01:52:38,518
DAMAGE THAN WEAKENING STORMS OF 

3311
01:52:38,518 --> 01:52:39,018
THE SAME MAGNITUDE. 

3312
01:52:39,018 --> 01:52:40,220
YOU HAVE TWO STORMS THAT ARE 

3313
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:41,521
BOTH 155, THE ONE THAT IS 

3314
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:42,856
STRENGTHENING WILL PRODUCE A 

3315
01:52:42,856 --> 01:52:44,057
LOT MORE DAMAGE THAN A 

3316
01:52:44,057 --> 01:52:44,424
WEAKENING ONE. 

3317
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:45,558
>> THERE WASN'T A LOT OF 

3318
01:52:45,558 --> 01:52:46,726
WARNING FOR THIS STORM, AND 

3319
01:52:46,726 --> 01:52:47,460
NOBODY EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN 

3320
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:47,861
SO QUICKLY. 

3321
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:49,495
>> I CAN SAY I WAS SURPRISED, 

3322
01:52:49,495 --> 01:52:53,666
TO BE HONEST. 

3323
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:54,667
I SAW THE WATER TEMPERATURES 4 

3324
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:55,935
TO 6 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL IN 

3325
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:56,903
THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO, 

3326
01:52:56,903 --> 01:52:58,171
THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR THIS TO 

3327
01:52:58,171 --> 01:53:00,139
BE A CATEGORY FOUR, I THINK IT 

3328
01:53:00,139 --> 01:53:00,940
WOULD GET TO 155? 

3329
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:01,875
THAT SEEMED UNLIKELY, BUT 140, 

3330
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:04,377
1:45, EITHER WAY,  YOU WOULD 

3331
01:53:04,377 --> 01:53:05,645
EVACUATE WITH WINDS LIKE THAT. 

3332
01:53:05,645 --> 01:53:07,113
I WAS SURPRISED BY THAT, BUT IT 

3333
01:53:07,113 --> 01:53:07,480
HAPPENED FAST. 

3334
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:08,314
WE SAW RAPID INTENSIFICATION, 

3335
01:53:08,314 --> 01:53:12,452
IT HAPPENED WITHIN 48 HOURS, 

3336
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:13,586
AND PEOPLE NEED MORE TIME TO 

3337
01:53:13,586 --> 01:53:14,921
PROCESS, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE 

3338
01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:15,922
ENOUGH TIME, EVEN THOUGH THE 

3339
01:53:15,922 --> 01:53:19,459
FORECAST TOLD PEOPLE TO GET OUT,

3340
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:21,060
PEOPLE MAY HAVE STAYED, AND I 

3341
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,629
KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DID, AND I 

3342
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:23,429
HAVE TO HOPE THE BEST. 

3343
01:53:23,429 --> 01:53:24,931
>> WE ARE ALL PRAYING FOR THEM. 

3344
01:53:24,931 --> 01:53:26,132
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT 

3345
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:26,365
UPDATE. 

3346
01:53:26,365 --> 01:53:27,700
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, 

3347
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,902
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE 

3348
01:53:28,902 --> 01:53:31,905
CBSN, STAY WITH US. 

3349
01:55:27,953 --> 01:55:32,959
>> I WANT TO BRING IN OUR NEWS 

3350
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:34,127
CORRESPONDENT, HE JOINS US FROM 

3351
01:55:34,127 --> 01:55:34,960
PORT SAINT JOE, IN FLORIDA, 

3352
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:35,762
HE'S ON THE PHONE. 

3353
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:37,062
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 

3354
01:55:37,062 --> 01:55:40,466
EXPERIENCING. 

3355
01:55:40,466 --> 01:55:41,434
>> RIGHT NOW, WE ARE STARTING 

3356
01:55:41,434 --> 01:55:43,036
TO GET SOME OF THE BACKSIDE OF 

3357
01:55:43,036 --> 01:55:43,636
THE BANDS FROM HURRICANE 

3358
01:55:43,636 --> 01:55:43,903
MICHAEL. 

3359
01:55:43,903 --> 01:55:45,538
WE SAW PLENTY OF LAND AS THE 

3360
01:55:45,538 --> 01:55:47,907
STORM SYSTEM IS MOVING ONTO 

3361
01:55:47,907 --> 01:55:49,342
SHORE, SOME OF THE TALL PINE 

3362
01:55:49,342 --> 01:55:51,711
TREES THAT ARE DOTTING ALL THE 

3363
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:53,546
LANDSCAPES HERE, OR JUST 

3364
01:55:53,546 --> 01:55:57,417
BENDING OVER SIDEWAYS. 

3365
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:58,718
WE SAW TREE SNAP, WE SAW PIECES 

3366
01:55:58,718 --> 01:55:59,819
OF BUILDING THAT WERE COMING 

3367
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:01,587
OFF, POWER IS OUT IN THIS AREA 

3368
01:56:01,587 --> 01:56:05,558
OF GULF COUNTY, AND THAT WILL 

3369
01:56:05,558 --> 01:56:06,693
BE SOMETHING THAT THE FOLKS 

3370
01:56:06,693 --> 01:56:07,827
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH FOR 

3371
01:56:07,827 --> 01:56:08,361
SEVERAL DAYS. 

3372
01:56:08,361 --> 01:56:10,463
AND MAYBE EVEN LONGER. 

3373
01:56:10,463 --> 01:56:12,498
STORM SURGE IS A BIG CONCERN, 

3374
01:56:12,498 --> 01:56:17,470
PEOPLE ARE STAYING OFF THE ROAD,

3375
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:18,471
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 

3376
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:19,605
THE BAD NEWS IS, THAT STORM 

3377
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:20,807
SURGE CAME WITH SOME PEER HE. 

3378
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:22,241
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES, WE SAW 

3379
01:56:22,241 --> 01:56:23,976
WATER ON THE ROAD THAT WAS JUST 

3380
01:56:23,976 --> 01:56:24,877
A FEW INCHES, RIDES UP TO 

3381
01:56:24,877 --> 01:56:27,347
ALMOST 2 FEET, IT WAS MOVING 

3382
01:56:27,347 --> 01:56:29,415
VERY QUICKLY. 

3383
01:56:29,415 --> 01:56:33,018
WE LITERALLY PARKED TO GET SOME 

3384
01:56:33,018 --> 01:56:34,253
SHOTS OF VIDEO, AND IT WAS 

3385
01:56:34,253 --> 01:56:34,987
RISING UP VERY FAST. 

3386
01:56:34,987 --> 01:56:37,590
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HUNKERED 

3387
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:38,992
DOWN, THERE WAS AN EVACUATION 

3388
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,660
ORDER IN THE AREA, ROUGHLY 35 

3389
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:41,527
HUNDRED PEOPLE -- 3500 PEOPLE 

3390
01:56:41,527 --> 01:56:47,266
LIVE IN SOUTH -- PORT SAINT 

3391
01:56:47,266 --> 01:56:47,867
JOE, THEY BELIEVE ABOUT 60%, 

3392
01:56:47,867 --> 01:56:49,335
MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE HERE 

3393
01:56:49,335 --> 01:56:50,036
IN PORT SAINT JOE WERE 

3394
01:56:50,036 --> 01:56:53,506
GATHERING SUPPLIES AND WERE 

3395
01:56:53,506 --> 01:56:59,411
HUNKERING DOWN. 

3396
01:56:59,411 --> 01:57:00,679
THERE'S A SMALL MOTEL THAT'S 

3397
01:57:00,679 --> 01:57:01,681
AROUND HERE, AND THE PARKING 

3398
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:02,815
LOT IS PACKED, AND IT'S A LOT 

3399
01:57:02,815 --> 01:57:04,050
OF LOCALS WHO WERE AT THEIR 

3400
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:05,184
VACATION HOMES OR THEIR HOMES 

3401
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:06,185
NEAR THE WATER, AND THEY 

3402
01:57:06,185 --> 01:57:07,820
DECIDED TO COME FARTHER INLAND 

3403
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:08,488
JUST IN CASE. 

3404
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:09,422
THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH 

3405
01:57:09,422 --> 01:57:09,822
STORM SURGE. 

3406
01:57:09,822 --> 01:57:11,124
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR YOU 

3407
01:57:11,124 --> 01:57:12,125
SAY THAT OFFICIALS ARE SAYING 

3408
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:13,392
THAT 60% OF PEOPLE CHOSE TO 

3409
01:57:13,392 --> 01:57:14,326
STAY, AND HUNKER DOWN. 

3410
01:57:14,326 --> 01:57:18,931
>> THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE 

3411
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:19,866
SHERIFF DEPARTMENT WAS NOT 

3412
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:21,234
GOING TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND 

3413
01:57:21,234 --> 01:57:22,535
PULL PEOPLE OUT AND TELL THEM 

3414
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:23,503
TO LEAVE, AND IT WAS A 

3415
01:57:23,503 --> 01:57:24,403
MANDATORY EVACUATION, THEY JUST 

3416
01:57:24,403 --> 01:57:25,405
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF 

3417
01:57:25,405 --> 01:57:25,671
MANPOWER. 

3418
01:57:25,671 --> 01:57:27,273
IT'S ALMOST THAT THOSE PEOPLE 

3419
01:57:27,273 --> 01:57:30,810
ARE AT THEIR OWN RISK. 

3420
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:31,944
THE HOSPITAL HERE IS CLOSED, 

3421
01:57:31,944 --> 01:57:35,214
THE AMBULANCES ARE INLAND. 

3422
01:57:35,214 --> 01:57:36,049
ONE OF THE COUNTY 

3423
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:37,116
COMMISSIONERS, WE SAW THEM OUT 

3424
01:57:37,116 --> 01:57:37,716
THERE SURVEYING THE DAMAGE 

3425
01:57:37,716 --> 01:57:41,621
BEFORE THE I HIT, AND HE 

3426
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:42,788
BASICALLY SAID, IF ANYBODY HAS 

3427
01:57:42,788 --> 01:57:44,090
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AT THIS 

3428
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:45,758
POINT, THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT 

3429
01:57:45,758 --> 01:57:46,659
UNTIL THE HURRICANE PASSES AND 

3430
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:49,828
IT'S SAFE FOR RESPONDERS. 

3431
01:57:49,828 --> 01:57:50,763
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY THEY 

3432
01:57:50,763 --> 01:57:54,767
TOLD PEOPLE TO LEAVE, BECAUSE 

3433
01:57:54,767 --> 01:57:55,968
IF YOU NEED HELP, IT'S NOT 

3434
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:56,736
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. 

3435
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:57,904
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR YOU 

3436
01:57:57,904 --> 01:57:58,237
SAY THAT. 

3437
01:57:58,237 --> 01:57:59,405
IN PORT SAINT JOE FLORIDA, 

3438
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:00,306

PARKINSON JOINS US NOW. 

3441
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:06,646
WHAT'S THE LATEST? 

3442
01:58:06,646 --> 01:58:09,415
>> THE LATEST IS THE STORM HAS 

3443
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:10,583
MADE LANDFALL,  IT MADE 

3444
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:11,450
LANDFALL AT 155 MILES PER HOUR, 

3445
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:12,785
AND IT CONTINUES TO LOOK FAIRLY 

3446
01:58:12,785 --> 01:58:16,022
HEALTHY,  STORMS ARE SUPPOSED 

3447
01:58:16,022 --> 01:58:17,290
TO GRADE AFTER THE MAKE 

3448
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:18,524
LANDFALL, AND THIS ONE SEEMS TO 

3449
01:58:18,524 --> 01:58:19,492
BE KEEPING ITS ACT TOGETHER. 

3450
01:58:19,492 --> 01:58:21,260
WE ARE ON TO PART TWO OF THE 

3451
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:25,097
STORM, WHICH WILL BE THE INLAND 

3452
01:58:25,097 --> 01:58:25,364
IMPACTS. 

3453
01:58:25,364 --> 01:58:26,699
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE 

3454
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:27,800
STORM SURGE THREAT IS DONE, THE 

3455
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,068
STORM SURGE IS STILL RISING IN 

3456
01:58:29,068 --> 01:58:32,071
PLACES, BUT IF YOU ARE IN 

3457
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:33,372
PANAMA CITY, PANAMA CITY BEACH 

3458
01:58:33,372 --> 01:58:34,507
AND YOU ARE HUNKER DOWN, YOU 

3459
01:58:34,507 --> 01:58:35,942
HAVE ANOTHER HOUR OR SO OF THE 

3460
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:37,043
EYEWALL TO DEAL WITH, THEN THE 

3461
01:58:37,043 --> 01:58:41,547
WINDS START BACKING DOWN ON THE 

3462
01:58:41,547 --> 01:58:41,981
OTHER SIDE. 

3463
01:58:41,981 --> 01:58:43,082
WE'VE HAD SUSTAINED WINDS IN 

3464
01:58:43,082 --> 01:58:44,016
THE TRIPLE DIGITS, GUSTS INTO 

3465
01:58:44,016 --> 01:58:46,118
THE 120, AND THAT'S WHAT WAS 

3466
01:58:46,118 --> 01:58:47,486
RECORDED BY OUR MEASUREMENTS 

3467
01:58:47,486 --> 01:58:48,488
THAT HAVEN'T BROKEN. 

3468
01:58:48,488 --> 01:58:49,322
THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU AN 

3469
01:58:49,322 --> 01:58:50,189
INDICATION OF HOW SERIOUS THE 

3470
01:58:50,189 --> 01:58:50,456
STORM IS. 

3471
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:55,194
THERE'S NO EVACUATING, WHAT WE 

3472
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:56,662
ARE IN THE MEAT OF THIS THING, 

3473
01:58:56,662 --> 01:58:58,231
AND WE WILL BE IN IT FOR THE 

3474
01:58:58,231 --> 01:58:58,897
NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. 

3475
01:58:58,897 --> 01:59:00,199
>> WALK ME THROUGH THE NEXT 

3476
01:59:00,199 --> 01:59:00,566
SEVERAL HOURS. 

3477
01:59:00,566 --> 01:59:01,333
THIS AFTERNOON, INTO THE 

3478
01:59:01,333 --> 01:59:02,535
EVENING, WHO IS AT RISK, WHAT 

3479
01:59:02,535 --> 01:59:03,869
WE NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR? 

3480
01:59:03,869 --> 01:59:05,638
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT, ALONG THE 

3481
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:10,576
I, THIS AREA FROM PANAMA CITY 

3482
01:59:10,576 --> 01:59:12,111
UP TO I 10, THAT'S WHERE YOU 

3483
01:59:12,111 --> 01:59:13,179
ARE SEEING THOSE WINDS THAT 

3484
01:59:13,179 --> 01:59:14,280
WILL BE IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS 

3485
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,449
OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. úBEYON 

3486
01:59:16,449 --> 01:59:17,350
SOME SERIOUS WIND GUSTS, 

3487
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:17,917
POTENTIALLY APPROACHING 100 

3488
01:59:17,917 --> 01:59:19,218
MILES PER HOUR IN TALLAHASSEE,  

3489
01:59:19,218 --> 01:59:20,686
OFF TO THE WEST OF THAT, AND 

3490
01:59:20,686 --> 01:59:21,554
THEN INTO SOUTHWESTERN GEORGIA. 

3491
01:59:21,554 --> 01:59:24,490
IT'S POSSIBLE THIS STAYS AT IT 

3492
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:30,529
-- AS A CATEGORY TWO PAST, 

3493
01:59:30,529 --> 01:59:31,564
ALMOST TOWARDS MACON, AND THE 

3494
01:59:31,564 --> 01:59:32,865
STORM CONTINUES TO MOVE OVER 

3495
01:59:32,865 --> 01:59:33,799
THE NIGHT, INTO THE MORNING, 

3496
01:59:33,799 --> 01:59:36,369
WHERE IT WILL BE INLAND FROM 

3497
01:59:36,369 --> 01:59:39,472
CHARLESTON AND SAVANNAH, THERE 

3498
01:59:39,472 --> 01:59:40,573
WILL BE GETTING SOME STORM 

3499
01:59:40,573 --> 01:59:44,944
SURGE AND WINS IN THE 50s AND 

3500
01:59:44,944 --> 01:59:46,178
60s, THE HEAVIEST RAIN WILL 

3501
01:59:46,178 --> 01:59:47,613
STAY OVER THE I 95 COURT OR. 

3502
01:59:47,613 --> 01:59:49,115
>> WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT FOR 

3503
01:59:49,115 --> 01:59:49,381
TOMORROW? 

3504
01:59:49,381 --> 01:59:50,583
>> FOR TOMORROW, THE STORM WILL 

3505
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:51,651
CONTINUE TO MAKE ITS WAY NORTH, 

3506
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:54,053
THAT WOULD BE INTO THE 

3507
01:59:54,053 --> 01:59:55,488
CAROLINAS, PLACES WHERE THEY 

3508
01:59:55,488 --> 01:59:58,557
SCARCELY NEED MORE RAIN AFTER 

3509
01:59:58,557 --> 01:59:59,358
HURRICANE FLORENCE, THEY COULD 

3510
01:59:59,358 --> 02:00:00,359
BE SEEING ANOTHER THREE, FOUR, 

3511
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:02,528
SIX, EIGHT INCH DEPENDING ON 

3512
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:03,296
WHERE THEY ARE IN LOCALIZED 

3513
02:00:03,296 --> 02:00:03,529
AREAS. 

3514
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:06,198
SOME OF THE RIVERS STILL 

3515
02:00:06,198 --> 02:00:06,899
HAVEN'T COME DOWN. 

3516
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:07,900
BY FRIDAY MORNING, THIS STORM 

3517
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:13,306
IS ALREADY OFF THE COAST, AND 

3518
02:00:13,306 --> 02:00:14,040
BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL, WE COULD 

3519
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:15,441
BE SEEING WIND GUSTS IN THE NEW 

3520
02:00:15,441 --> 02:00:16,642
YORK AREA, BUT FOR ALL INTENTS 

3521
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:17,576
AND PURPOSES, ONCE THE STORE 

3522
02:00:17,576 --> 02:00:19,011
MAKES IT PAST NORFOLK, THE 

3523
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:25,017
DANGER IS DONE, BUT BY NO MEANS 

3524
02:00:25,017 --> 02:00:25,985
IS THE THREAT DONE IN THE 

3525
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:26,819
INLAND AREAS, WHERE TORNADOES 

3526
02:00:26,819 --> 02:00:27,987
CONTINUE TO BE A THREAT THROUGH 

3527
02:00:27,987 --> 02:00:29,522
THE NIGHT INTO TOMORROW. 

3528
02:00:29,522 --> 02:00:31,457
>> THEY ARE SAYING MICHAEL 

3529
02:00:31,457 --> 02:00:32,925
COULD BE ONE OF THE WORST IN 

3530
02:00:32,925 --> 02:00:33,759
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. 

3531
02:00:33,759 --> 02:00:35,127
>> MICHAEL ALREADY IS, IN TERMS 

3532
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:38,564
OF, LET'S BREAK IT DOWN 

3533
02:00:38,564 --> 02:00:38,964
CHRONOLOGICALLY. 

3534
02:00:38,964 --> 02:00:40,700
SINCE 1960, WHICH IS THE 

3535
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:41,534
SATELLITE ERA, WE'VE ONLY HAD 

3536
02:00:41,534 --> 02:00:43,903
TWO MAKE LANDFALL WITH HIGHER 

3537
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:44,570
WIND SPEEDS. 

3538
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:45,738
THAT WOULD BE CAMILLE AND 

3539
02:00:45,738 --> 02:00:45,971
ANDREW. 

3540
02:00:45,971 --> 02:00:46,605
WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE STORM, 

3541
02:00:46,605 --> 02:00:49,375
CAMILLE, WITH A STRONGER 

3542
02:00:49,375 --> 02:00:49,942
STRENGTH CENTRAL PRESSURE. 

3543
02:00:49,942 --> 02:00:51,477
THIS STORM, IN TERMS OF THE 

3544
02:00:51,477 --> 02:00:53,446
DEEPNESS OF THE CENTRAL 

3545
02:00:53,446 --> 02:00:55,348
PRESSURE, IS STRONGER, THINK 

3546
02:00:55,348 --> 02:00:57,984
KATRINA, STRONGER THAN ANDREW. 

3547
02:00:57,984 --> 02:00:59,518
THAT SHOULD SHOW YOU HOW 

3548
02:00:59,518 --> 02:01:02,488
RAREFIED THE AIR IT IS, IT WAS 

3549
02:01:02,488 --> 02:01:03,723
TWO MILES PER HOUR AWAY FROM 

3550
02:01:03,723 --> 02:01:07,093
THE CAT FIVE, THE DEVASTATION 

3551
02:01:07,093 --> 02:01:08,494
IN TERMS OF ROOMS RIPPED OFF IN 

3552
02:01:08,494 --> 02:01:12,798
TERMS OF CARS TOPPLED OVER, WE 

3553
02:01:12,798 --> 02:01:14,066
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE 

3554
02:01:14,066 --> 02:01:15,301
THAT QUICKLY, WE MIGHT EVEN SEE 

3555
02:01:15,301 --> 02:01:16,402
SOME OF THE REAL 1st PICTURES 

3556
02:01:16,402 --> 02:01:17,536
OF  DAMAGE SURVEYS BEFORE THE 

3557
02:01:17,536 --> 02:01:25,578
NIGHT TO NIGHT. 

3558
02:01:25,578 --> 02:01:26,512
BY NO MEANS SHOULD YOU BE GOING 

3559
02:01:26,512 --> 02:01:27,913
OUT THE SURVEY, OR TO LOOK 

3560
02:01:27,913 --> 02:01:28,814
UNTIL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IN 

3561
02:01:28,814 --> 02:01:29,615
YOUR AREA SAYS IT'S SAFE. 

3562
02:01:29,615 --> 02:01:30,850
>> WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING AT 

3563
02:01:30,850 --> 02:01:31,250
THIS POINT? 

3564
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:32,451
>> A COUPLE THINGS THAT I'M 

3565
02:01:32,451 --> 02:01:32,717
WATCHING. 

3566
02:01:32,717 --> 02:01:34,186
THE 1st THING IS  WHEN IS THIS 

3567
02:01:34,186 --> 02:01:39,759
THING GOING TO WEAKEN. 

3568
02:01:39,759 --> 02:01:40,359
HURRICANE MICHAEL WAS 

3569
02:01:40,359 --> 02:01:41,593
INTENSIFYING ALL THE WAY UP TO 

3570
02:01:41,593 --> 02:01:43,295
LANDFALL, IT GOT 155 AT ITS 

3571
02:01:43,295 --> 02:01:43,929
LANDFALL POINT, AND HONESTLY, 

3572
02:01:43,929 --> 02:01:44,864
IT WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO 

3573
02:01:44,864 --> 02:01:46,032
CATEGORY FIVE IF IT HAD ANOTHER 

3574
02:01:46,032 --> 02:01:46,232
HOUR. 

3575
02:01:46,232 --> 02:01:47,433
THE QUESTION IS, HOW FAR INLAND 

3576
02:01:47,433 --> 02:01:53,706
DO WE SEE THOSE WINS INTO THE 

3577
02:01:53,706 --> 02:01:54,707
60s, 70s, 80s, 100S, BECAUSE 

3578
02:01:54,707 --> 02:01:55,875
ONCE YOU ARE ABOVE 60, THAT'S 

3579
02:01:55,875 --> 02:01:56,942
ALL YOU NEED TO START TAKING 

3580
02:01:56,942 --> 02:01:58,544
DOWN TREES, AND WE WILL BE 

3581
02:01:58,544 --> 02:02:00,279
SEEING INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF 

3582
02:02:00,279 --> 02:02:01,380
POWER OUTAGES, AND YOU WILL BE 

3583
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:02,648
SEEING PEOPLE WHO WILL BE 

3584
02:02:02,648 --> 02:02:03,449
WITHOUT POWER FOR DAYS INTO 

3585
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:04,450
WEEKS, JUST BECAUSE THERE'S 

3586
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:06,585
GOING TO BE SO MANY TREES DOWN. 

3587
02:02:06,585 --> 02:02:07,987
THE TREES ARE VERY TALL, THEY 

3588
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:09,588
HAVE LARGE CANOPIES, THEY ARE 

3589
02:02:09,588 --> 02:02:11,590
EASILY WEIGHTED DOWN, SO IT 

3590
02:02:11,590 --> 02:02:14,093
WILL BE A LONG AND EXHAUSTIVE 

3591
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:16,228
CLEANUP IN THE INLAND AREAS, 

3592
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:17,496

BEACH, WHERE THE HEAVIEST 

3596
02:02:22,535 --> 02:02:23,536
DAMAGE WILL HAVE OCCURRED.

MY HOUSE, WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE 

3606
02:02:38,784 --> 02:02:40,019
A STRONG WIND THAT IS COMING IN 

3607
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:41,387
FROM THE NORTH, THE PALM TREES

REALLY RUSTLING IN THE WIND AND 

3611
02:02:49,028 --> 02:02:51,697
THE RAIN IS BLOWING SIDEWAYS AT 

3612
02:02:51,697 --> 02:02:52,297

WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT, IT 

3676

3686
02:04:53,219 --> 02:04:57,122
CLOSE TO THE OCEAN, YOU WILL 

3687
02:04:57,122 --> 02:04:58,724
SEE A LOT OF FLOODING, AND WE 

3688
02:04:58,724 --> 02:04:59,625
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THOSE

02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:13,906
AS WE CONTINUE WITH THESE 

3697
02:05:13,906 --> 02:05:14,473
INCREDIBLE HURRICANES YEAR 

3698
02:05:14,473 --> 02:05:15,074
AFTER YEAR? 

3699
02:05:15,074 --> 02:05:15,808
>> DESTIN, FLORIDA, IRONICALLY, 

3700
02:05:15,808 --> 02:05:17,309
WE HAVE NOT SEEN A DIRECT HIT 

3701
02:05:17,309 --> 02:05:19,411
OF THE HURRICANE HERE, IN WELL 

3702
02:05:19,411 --> 02:05:23,415
OVER A DECADE. 

3703
02:05:23,415 --> 02:05:24,884
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD, 

3704
02:05:24,884 --> 02:05:26,518
I'M A NEWER RESIDENT, I JUST 

3705

MOVED HERE WITHIN THE LAST 

3706
02:05:28,787 --> 02:05:30,189
YEAR, SO I CAN'T SPEAK FROM 

3707
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:30,789
EXPERIENCE ON THAT. 

3708
02:05:30,789 --> 02:05:32,257
I CAN SAY WHAT OTHERS HAVE TOLD 

3709
02:05:32,257 --> 02:05:33,259
ME IS THAT, TYPICALLY, DESTIN 

3710
02:05:33,259 --> 02:05:37,329
HAS A WEATHER DOME WHERE THE 

3711
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:38,230
WEATHER JUST GOES BY IT. 

3712
02:05:38,230 --> 02:05:39,798
FOR US TO EVEN BE GETTING A 

3713
02:05:39,798 --> 02:05:40,599
TROPICAL STORM RIGHT NOW IS 

3714
02:05:40,599 --> 02:05:41,433
SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL, ALTHOUGH NOT 

3715
02:05:41,433 --> 02:05:43,134
COMPLETELY OUT OF THE REALM OF 

3716
02:05:43,134 --> 02:05:44,236
POSSIBILITY. 

3717
02:05:44,236 --> 02:05:48,507
AS FAR AS THE OFFICIALS, I AM 

3718
02:05:48,507 --> 02:05:50,209
JUST A LOCAL, I CAN'T SPEAK FOR 

3719
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:53,078
THEM, BUT I CAN SAY WHAT THEY 

3720
02:05:53,078 --> 02:05:54,380
HAVE BEEN TELLING US, THEY'VE 

3721
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:56,148
DONE A GREAT JOB OF 

3722
02:05:56,148 --> 02:05:57,549
COMMUNICATING WITH EVERYONE TO 

3723
02:05:57,549 --> 02:05:58,917
TELL US, THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED 

3724
02:05:58,917 --> 02:06:00,052
TO DO TO BE PREPARED, THIS IS 

3725
02:06:00,052 --> 02:06:01,153
HOW YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO 

3726
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:02,087
COMMUNICATE WITH FAMILIES AND 

3727
02:06:02,087 --> 02:06:05,991
RELATIVES AND LOVED ONES. 

3728
02:06:05,991 --> 02:06:07,325
SOME ZONES IN MY COUNTY WERE 

3729
02:06:07,325 --> 02:06:08,126
GIVEN A MANDATORY EVACUATION 

3730
02:06:08,126 --> 02:06:09,627
ORDER, BECAUSE THEY WERE IN LOW-

3731
02:06:09,627 --> 02:06:10,629
LYING LEVELS THAT WERE 

3732
02:06:10,629 --> 02:06:11,730
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE STORM SURGE, 

3733
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,132
AND FLOODWATERS, OR THE RAIN 

3734
02:06:13,132 --> 02:06:17,469
INCREASING THE FLOOD AROUND 

3735
02:06:17,469 --> 02:06:18,871
THEM. 

3736
02:06:18,871 --> 02:06:20,205
THEY DID SAY MAKE SURE YOU GUYS 

3737
02:06:20,205 --> 02:06:21,774
GET OUT AND GO FIND A SAFE 

3738
02:06:21,774 --> 02:06:22,975
PLACE TO BE, HOWEVER, I THINK 

3739
02:06:22,975 --> 02:06:24,209
THAT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, 

3740
02:06:24,209 --> 02:06:28,914

3741
02:06:28,914 --> 02:06:29,915

WORST THAT WILL HAPPEN TO US 

3744
02:06:36,789 --> 02:06:38,057
WILL BE THE POWER GOING OUT. 

3745
02:06:38,057 --> 02:06:38,691
ABSOLUTELY, AND CERTAINLY, OUR

AFFECT WHERE YOU ARE THERE IN

THE BIG CONCERN HERE IS CLEARLY 

3926
02:13:21,093 --> 02:13:22,160
NOT GOING TO BE COASTAL 

3927
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,028
FLOODING, OR STORM SURGE. 

3928
02:13:23,028 --> 02:13:24,229
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS. 

3929
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:27,032
SO MANY TREES HERE, AND ANY OF 

3930
02:13:27,032 --> 02:13:29,667
THEM THAT ARE OLD OR DYING, OR 

3931
02:13:29,667 --> 02:13:30,669
SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE THE 

3932
02:13:30,669 --> 02:13:31,370
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS, WILL 

3933
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:34,873
LOSE BRANCHES AND TREES THEY 

3934
02:13:34,873 --> 02:13:36,108
ARE EXPECTED TO COME DOWN ON 

3935
02:13:36,108 --> 02:13:37,175
THE HOMES, ONTO BUILDINGS, 

3936
02:13:37,175 --> 02:13:40,579
WHICH COULD CAUSE INJURY OR 

3937
02:13:40,579 --> 02:13:41,947
DEATH, THAT IS WHY THEY ARE 

3938
02:13:41,947 --> 02:13:42,981
WANTING TO GET PEOPLE INTO 

3939
02:13:42,981 --> 02:13:46,551
SHELTERS AWAY FROM TREES, BUT 

3940
02:13:46,551 --> 02:13:47,386
ALSO THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE 

3941
02:13:47,386 --> 02:13:48,186
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE POWER 

3942
02:13:48,186 --> 02:13:48,987
OUTAGES THAT ARE EXPECTED 

3943
02:13:48,987 --> 02:13:49,588
THROUGHOUT THIS AREA. 

3944
02:13:49,588 --> 02:13:51,289
IT WILL BE A ROUGH LATE 

3945
02:13:51,289 --> 02:13:52,591
AFTERNOON TO EVENING FOR THE 

3946
02:13:52,591 --> 02:13:54,092
TALLAHASSEE AREA, THEN IT MOVES 

3947
02:13:54,092 --> 02:13:57,362
OUT OF HERE, AND WE TAKE A LOOK 

3948
02:13:57,362 --> 02:13:58,730
AT WHAT DAMAGE LEFT BEHIND. 

3949
02:13:58,730 --> 02:14:00,065
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT AS FAR 

3950
02:14:00,065 --> 02:14:01,533
AS POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE 

3951
02:14:01,533 --> 02:14:03,835
WINDS START TO GET CONSISTENT, 

3952
02:14:03,835 --> 02:14:05,804
AT 35 MILES PER HOUR,  AND WE 

3953
02:14:05,804 --> 02:14:09,307
MAY BE THERE VERY SOON, THAT IS 

3954
02:14:09,307 --> 02:14:10,175
WHEN THE POWER COMPANY SAYS 

3955
02:14:10,175 --> 02:14:14,979
IT'S NO LONGER SAFE FOR OTHER 

3956
02:14:14,979 --> 02:14:16,181
CREWS TO BE OUT AND ABOUT, 

3957
02:14:16,181 --> 02:14:16,947
TRYING TO RESTORE WHATEVER 

3958
02:14:16,947 --> 02:14:17,849
POWERLINES MAY HAVE BEEN 

3959
02:14:17,849 --> 02:14:18,850
KNOCKED DOWN EARLY IN THE 

3960
02:14:18,850 --> 02:14:19,083
STORM. 

3961
02:14:19,083 --> 02:14:20,185
THEY WON'T BE DOING THAT 

3962
02:14:20,185 --> 02:14:21,953
ANYMORE, SO IT MAY NOT BE UNTIL 

3963
02:14:21,953 --> 02:14:22,620
TOMORROW WHEN THEY GET DAYLIGHT 

3964
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,488
AND THE WINDS HAVE PASSED 

3965
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,823
THROUGH THIS AREA THAT THEY ARE 

3966
02:14:24,823 --> 02:14:25,757
FINALLY ABLE TO START CLEARING 

3967
02:14:25,757 --> 02:14:29,461
TREES AND TRYING TO RESTORE 

3968
02:14:29,461 --> 02:14:33,431
POWER. THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES 

3969
02:14:33,431 --> 02:14:34,432
WHEN IT COMES TO RESTORING 

3970
02:14:34,432 --> 02:14:35,300
POWER, THE HOSPITALS, THE 

3971
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:36,201
NURSING HOMES, THE ASSISTED 

3972
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:36,868
LIVING FACILITIES, THOSE ARE 

3973
02:14:36,868 --> 02:14:38,904
THE ONES THEY WILL TRY TO GET 

3974
02:14:38,904 --> 02:14:41,573
BACK ONLINE 1st, CLEARLY, FOR 

3975
02:14:41,573 --> 02:14:41,973
OBVIOUS REASONS. 

3976
02:14:41,973 --> 02:14:43,074
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 

3977
02:14:43,074 --> 02:14:44,910
THE POWER THE MOST , AND THE 

3978
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:47,679
MOST QUICKLY. 

3979
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:49,281
IT WILL BE A ROUGH GOING HERE 

3980
02:14:49,281 --> 02:14:50,115
IN TALLAHASSEE AS WE ARE 

3981
02:14:50,115 --> 02:14:51,016
STARTING TO SEE THOSE REPORTS 

3982
02:14:51,016 --> 02:14:52,384
FROM THE COAST, AND A SLIGHTLY 

3983
02:14:52,384 --> 02:14:54,820
WEAKER VERSION OF MICHAEL 

3984
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:56,488
BEGINS TO MAKE ITS WAY HERE 

3985
02:14:56,488 --> 02:15:00,959
INTO THE STATES CAPITAL. 

3986
02:15:00,959 --> 02:15:01,860
>> YOU LIVE IN MIAMI, YOU KNOW 

3987
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:02,761
ABOUT HURRICANE COVERAGE AND 

3988
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:03,061
PREPARATIN. 

3989
02:15:03,061 --> 02:15:04,596
I'M CURIOUS, THE FOLKS YOU HAVE 

3990
02:15:04,596 --> 02:15:10,735
SPOKEN TO, WHAT ARE THE STORES 

3991
02:15:10,735 --> 02:15:11,903
LIKE THERE, THE GAS LINES, WHAT 

3992
02:15:11,903 --> 02:15:13,271
HAVE PEOPLE DONE TO PREPARE AT 

3993
02:15:13,271 --> 02:15:13,604
THIS POINT? 

3994
02:15:13,604 --> 02:15:14,806
WHAT DO PEOPLE ADVISE YOU TO DO 

3995
02:15:14,806 --> 02:15:16,108
WHEN YOU KNOW THIS IS COMING? 

3996
02:15:16,108 --> 02:15:17,275
>> Reporter: WE GOT HERE, AND 

3997
02:15:17,275 --> 02:15:26,785
AS YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LAND IN 

3998
02:15:26,785 --> 02:15:27,619
THIS AREA BEFORE A DISASTER, 

3999
02:15:27,619 --> 02:15:29,054
YOU GO LOOK FOR WATER FOR YOUR 

4000
02:15:29,054 --> 02:15:30,088
CREW, THEN FOR YOURSELF, AND 

4001
02:15:30,088 --> 02:15:31,089
IMMEDIATELY THE 1st WALMART I 

4002
02:15:31,089 --> 02:15:32,524
WENT TO WAS OUT OF BREAD, OUT 

4003
02:15:32,524 --> 02:15:33,024
OF WATER. 

4004
02:15:33,024 --> 02:15:34,059
PEOPLE DID PREPARE, THERE WERE 

4005
02:15:34,059 --> 02:15:35,227
GAS LINES, WE ARE NOT SEEING 

4006
02:15:35,227 --> 02:15:36,728
MANY OF THOSE NOW  COME UP 

4007
02:15:36,728 --> 02:15:37,963
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE GAS 

4008
02:15:37,963 --> 02:15:38,897
STATIONS HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP 

4009
02:15:38,897 --> 02:15:39,998
UP THEIR PUMPS, HOPING TO SAVE 

4010
02:15:39,998 --> 02:15:41,166
THEM FROM ANY WATER DAMAGE. 

4011
02:15:41,166 --> 02:15:42,267
AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE HEARD 

4012
02:15:42,267 --> 02:15:43,568
THE OFFICIAL SAY IT OVER AND 

4013
02:15:43,568 --> 02:15:44,703
OVER, IF YOU ARE NO LONGER 

4014
02:15:44,703 --> 02:15:45,904
PREPARED, OR IF YOU ARE STILL 

4015
02:15:45,904 --> 02:15:47,105
TRYING TO PREPARE, THE TIME IS 

4016
02:15:47,105 --> 02:15:48,406
UP HERE RIGHT NOW, BRACE FOR 

4017
02:15:48,406 --> 02:15:50,809
IT, HUNKER DOWN, GET INDOORS, 

4018
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:53,144
TO THE INNERMOST PART OF ANY 

4019
02:15:53,144 --> 02:15:55,213
BUILDING, YOU MENTIONED THE 

4020
02:15:55,213 --> 02:16:00,685
LESSONS LEARNED FROM LIVING IN 

4021
02:16:00,685 --> 02:16:01,686
SOUTH FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY AFTER 

4022
02:16:01,686 --> 02:16:02,821
IRMA LAST YEAR, YOU RECALL 

4023
02:16:02,821 --> 02:16:03,722
THERE WAS THAT HORRIBLE 

4024
02:16:03,722 --> 02:16:04,656
INCIDENT AT A NURSING HOME 

4025
02:16:04,656 --> 02:16:05,624
WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER THE 

4026
02:16:05,624 --> 02:16:09,661
POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOR DAYS, 

4027
02:16:09,661 --> 02:16:10,829
AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 

4028
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:11,896
THE POWER BACK INTO THE 

4029
02:16:11,896 --> 02:16:12,163
BUILDING. 

4030
02:16:12,163 --> 02:16:12,797
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 

4031
02:16:12,797 --> 02:16:14,099
GENERATOR, THERE'S A NEW LAW 

4032
02:16:14,099 --> 02:16:16,668
HERE IN FLORIDA THAT IS AIMING 

4033
02:16:16,668 --> 02:16:17,936
TO PREVENT THAT KIND OF A 

4034
02:16:17,936 --> 02:16:20,105
TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. 

4035
02:16:20,105 --> 02:16:20,772
AND REQUIRING ALL NURSING HOMES 

4036
02:16:20,772 --> 02:16:23,441
AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES 

4037
02:16:23,441 --> 02:16:29,547
TO HAVE GENERATORS, BUT AFTER 

4038
02:16:29,547 --> 02:16:30,815
THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 1 PAST, 

4039
02:16:30,815 --> 02:16:31,883
NUMBERS SHOW THAT A LOT OF 

4040
02:16:31,883 --> 02:16:32,751
THOSE FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN 

4041
02:16:32,751 --> 02:16:33,852
THE AREA, DON'T HAVE THOSE 

4042
02:16:33,852 --> 02:16:34,218
INSTALLED YET. 

4043
02:16:34,218 --> 02:16:35,553
FOR MANY REASONS. 

4044
02:16:35,553 --> 02:16:37,055
ZONING REGULATIONS, THERE'S A 

4045
02:16:37,055 --> 02:16:38,121
LABOR SHORTAGE, AND A SHORTAGE 

4046
02:16:38,121 --> 02:16:46,263
OF THOSE SUPPLIES, BUT THEY 

4047
02:16:46,263 --> 02:16:47,465
STILL HAVE TO PROVE THEY CAN 

4048
02:16:47,465 --> 02:16:48,700
KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE, AND THAT 

4049
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:49,467
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS 

4050
02:16:49,467 --> 02:16:50,669
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY INTO, AND 

4051
02:16:50,669 --> 02:16:51,602
THAT'S WHERE THE POWER 

4052
02:16:51,602 --> 02:16:52,370
COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO 

4053
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:53,171
PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS, TO 

4054
02:16:53,171 --> 02:16:54,039
PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE THAT FROM 

4055
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:54,873
HAPPENING AGAIN. 

4056
02:16:54,873 --> 02:16:55,707
AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE TREES 

4057
02:16:55,707 --> 02:16:56,841
COME UP THEY REALLY GET GOING, 

4058
02:16:56,841 --> 02:17:00,445
AND THAT IS WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S 

4059
02:17:00,445 --> 02:17:01,046
STARTING TO BECOME MORE 

4060
02:17:01,046 --> 02:17:02,112
CONSISTENT, IT'S NO LONGER ONCE 

4061
02:17:02,112 --> 02:17:03,682
EVERY 10 MINUTES, IT'S STARTING 

4062
02:17:03,682 --> 02:17:06,618
TO BECOME MORE OF A REGULAR 

4063
02:17:06,618 --> 02:17:07,485
FLOW THROUGH, SO CLEARLY, 

4064
02:17:07,485 --> 02:17:10,188
MICHAEL IS GETTING CLOSER. 

4065
02:17:10,188 --> 02:17:15,459
>> YOU CAN PREDICT THAT JUST BY 

4066
02:17:15,459 --> 02:17:16,761
LOOKING AT THE TREES, THANK YOU 

4067
02:17:16,761 --> 02:17:17,796
SO MUCH, PLEASE STAY SAFE, WE 

4068
02:17:17,796 --> 02:17:19,263

THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

4071
02:17:20,932 --> 02:17:22,367
WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO COVERAGE 

4072
02:17:22,367 --> 02:17:23,334
FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE, 

4073
02:17:23,334 --> 02:17:29,139
WC TV, FOR MORE ON THE STORM. 

4074
02:17:29,139 --> 02:17:30,642
>> THE SAME THING DOWN AT

02:17:30,642 --> 02:17:31,743
TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE, ALL 

4076
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:32,544
THESE WEATHER STATIONS AFFECTED 

4077
02:17:32,544 --> 02:17:34,879
BY THE WEATHER, AND/OR THE 

4078
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:35,413
POWER OUTAGES. 

4079
02:17:35,413 --> 02:17:38,116
REGARDLESS, WE KNOW THAT THE 

4080
02:17:38,116 --> 02:17:43,521
MOST INTENSE WINDS ARE RIGHT 

4081
02:17:43,521 --> 02:17:44,388
HERE, MOVING INTO JACKSON 

4082
02:17:44,388 --> 02:17:45,223
COUNTY, AND OVER THE 

4083
02:17:45,223 --> 02:17:46,057
NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF CALHOUN 

4084
02:17:46,057 --> 02:17:46,958
COUNTY, AND EVEN ACROSS THE 

4085
02:17:46,958 --> 02:17:48,393
RIVER INTO NORTHWESTERN PARTS 

4086
02:17:48,393 --> 02:17:50,662
OF LIBERTY COUNTY. 

4087
02:17:50,662 --> 02:17:51,596
BRISTOL, GETTING SOME OF THE 

4088
02:17:51,596 --> 02:17:52,496
STRONGEST WINDS YOU WILL SEE 

4089
02:17:52,496 --> 02:17:53,431
WITH THIS SYSTEM, MOVING UP 

4090
02:17:53,431 --> 02:17:58,670
INTO THE EASTERN PARTS OF 

4091
02:17:58,670 --> 02:17:59,804
JACKSON COUNTY, AND THAT ALSO 

4092
02:17:59,804 --> 02:18:00,538
MEANS THAT, FROM QUINCY OVER 

4093
02:18:00,538 --> 02:18:01,439
TOWARDS SNEADS AND 

4094
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:02,072
CHATTAHOOCHEE, LAKE SEMINOLE, 

4095
02:18:02,072 --> 02:18:03,308
THESE ARE ALL AREAS THAT YOU 

4096
02:18:03,308 --> 02:18:05,744
COULD SEE THOSE WINS, AND 

4097
02:18:05,744 --> 02:18:07,077
EASILY GUSTS EXCEEDING 75 MILES 

4098
02:18:07,077 --> 02:18:08,612
PER HOUR,  EVEN SUSTAINED, WE 

4099
02:18:08,612 --> 02:18:12,950
COULD SEE 50 TO 60, 75 MILES 

4100
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:14,285
PER HOUR WINDS SUSTAINED FOR A 

4101
02:18:14,285 --> 02:18:16,754
SHORT TIME  AS THE CORE MOVES 

4102
02:18:16,754 --> 02:18:17,422
BY. 

4103
02:18:17,422 --> 02:18:18,289
I'VE BEEN SAMPLING THE WINDS, 

4104
02:18:18,289 --> 02:18:19,957
IT'S A FEW MINUTES OWN, THIS 

4105
02:18:19,957 --> 02:18:21,825
SHOWS THAT SOME OF THE WINDS 

4106
02:18:21,825 --> 02:18:24,129
THAT I SAMPLED INTO JACKSON 

4107
02:18:24,129 --> 02:18:25,430
COUNTY WERE 83 MILES PER HOUR, 

4108
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:27,098
THAT IS LIKELY  ELEVATED A 

4109
02:18:27,098 --> 02:18:28,799
LITTLE BIT, BUT I WOULDN'T BE 

4110
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:35,039
SURPRISED IF WE SEE SOME GUSTS 

4111
02:18:35,039 --> 02:18:35,840
AT LEAST AS STRONG TOWARD THE 

4112
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,508
SURFACE, GETTING CLOSE TO 

4113
02:18:36,508 --> 02:18:38,175
MARIANNA, AS YOU GET DOWN TO 

4114
02:18:38,175 --> 02:18:39,411
CENTRAL CALHOUN COUNTY, 

4115
02:18:39,411 --> 02:18:40,445
MEASURING THE VELOCITY AT 87 

4116
02:18:40,445 --> 02:18:41,612
MILES PER HOUR, AND BACK INTO 

4117
02:18:41,612 --> 02:18:42,746
BAY COUNTY,  IT'S GETTING 

4118
02:18:42,746 --> 02:18:44,415
LIGHTER, BUT STILL 85 MILES PER 

4119
02:18:44,415 --> 02:18:46,518
HOUR.  

4120
02:18:46,518 --> 02:18:47,886
NEAR THAT CORE, YOU'RE GOING TO 

4121
02:18:47,886 --> 02:18:49,187
SEE 85 TO 100 MILES PER HOUR 

4122
02:18:49,187 --> 02:18:50,955
WINDS  THE WITH THE POSSIBILITY 

4123
02:18:50,955 --> 02:18:55,293
FOR HIGHER GUSTS. 

4124
02:18:55,293 --> 02:18:56,661
IT WILL GET WEAKER, BUT IT'S 

4125
02:18:56,661 --> 02:18:56,960
NOT WEAK. 

4126
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,263
IT WILL STILL BE A MAJOR IMPACT 

4127
02:18:58,263 --> 02:18:59,063
MAKER THROUGHOUT JACKSON 

4128
02:18:59,063 --> 02:18:59,697
COUNTY, MOVING INTO SEMINOLE 

4129
02:18:59,697 --> 02:19:00,898
COUNTY, VERY CLOSE THERE, AND 

4130
02:19:00,898 --> 02:19:08,173
UP THROUGH PARTS OF MILLER, AND 

4131
02:19:08,173 --> 02:19:09,341
THE LOWER WESTERN PARTS OF 

4132
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:10,241
DECATUR COUNTY, WE COULD SEE 

4133
02:19:10,241 --> 02:19:11,743
WIND GUSTS WELL IN EXCESS OF 75 

4134
02:19:11,743 --> 02:19:13,111
MILES PER HOUR . THEN, THEY 

4135
02:19:13,111 --> 02:19:14,378
START TO DROP OFF QUICKLY, ONCE 

4136
02:19:14,378 --> 02:19:17,549
YOU GET FARTHER AWAY FROM THAT 

4137
02:19:17,549 --> 02:19:17,949
CORE. 

4138
02:19:17,949 --> 02:19:19,150
PUTTING THIS INTO MOTION, YOU 

4139
02:19:19,150 --> 02:19:20,218
HAVE A BETTER IDEA THAT IT'S 

4140
02:19:20,218 --> 02:19:21,486
MOVING ALONG NOW, YOU CAN SEE 

4141
02:19:21,486 --> 02:19:23,655
THAT THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE I 

4142
02:19:23,655 --> 02:19:26,191
IS NOW MOVING INTO JACKSON 

4143
02:19:26,191 --> 02:19:28,626
COUNTY, YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE 

4144
02:19:28,626 --> 02:19:29,960
INTENSE BANDS THAT ARE ALL THE 

4145
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,663
WAY OUT TOWARDS THE EAST, THEY 

4146
02:19:31,663 --> 02:19:42,941
DO GET LIGHTER IN INTENSITY, AS 

4147
02:19:42,941 --> 02:19:44,041
YOU GET TOWARD THE SUWANEE 

4148
02:19:44,041 --> 02:19:45,043
RIVER VALLEY, BUT STILL SOME 

4149
02:19:45,043 --> 02:19:46,443
AREAS HAVE PICKED UP 1 TO 3 

4150
02:19:46,443 --> 02:19:47,812
INCHES OF RAIN, AND WE STILL 

4151
02:19:47,812 --> 02:19:48,580
HAVE A TORNADO THREAT 

4152
02:19:48,580 --> 02:19:48,880
REGIONWIDE. 

4153
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:49,848
WE'VE SEEN A FEW WARNINGS FOR 

4154
02:19:49,848 --> 02:19:51,182
THESE CELLS THAT MOVED UP 

4155
02:19:51,182 --> 02:19:52,016
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE 

4156
02:19:52,016 --> 02:19:53,218
PENINSULA, MOVING TOWARD WEST 

4157
02:19:53,218 --> 02:19:53,852
OF JACKSONVILLE, WEST OF DUVAL 

4158
02:19:53,852 --> 02:19:55,119
COUNTY, BUT SO FAR, WE HAVE NOT 

4159
02:19:55,119 --> 02:19:56,154
SEEN THOSE ROTATING STORMS HERE 

4160
02:19:56,154 --> 02:19:57,121
REGARDLESS OF THE TORNADO 

4161
02:19:57,121 --> 02:19:57,755
WATCH, BECAUSE OF THE 

4162
02:19:57,755 --> 02:19:59,591
POTENTIAL, THAT GOES TO 5:00, 

4163
02:19:59,591 --> 02:20:00,225
PROBABLY ABOUT 10:00 TONIGHT, 

4164
02:20:00,225 --> 02:20:01,292
AND THEN EXTREME WIND WARNINGS 

4165
02:20:01,292 --> 02:20:02,761
FOR THAT AREA OF INTENSE WINDS 

4166
02:20:02,761 --> 02:20:05,797
RIGHT NEAR THAT CENTER OF THE 

4167
02:20:05,797 --> 02:20:07,832
EYE OF MICHAEL AS IT MOVES OFF 

4168
02:20:07,832 --> 02:20:08,800
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST. 

4169
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:09,434
FROM JACKSON COUNTY, SEMINAL 

4170
02:20:09,434 --> 02:20:10,568
WESTERN DECATUR, NORTHWESTERN 

4171
02:20:10,568 --> 02:20:12,837
PARTS OF GETZEN COUNTY, WESTERN 

4172
02:20:12,837 --> 02:20:19,143
PARTS OF LIBERTY COUNTY. 

4173
02:20:19,143 --> 02:20:20,044
HERE'S A SATELLITE VIEW, YOU 

4174
02:20:20,044 --> 02:20:21,413
CAN WATCH THAT CORE OF THE 

4175
02:20:21,413 --> 02:20:22,647
STORM AS IT MOVES ASHORE, I'VE 

4176
02:20:22,647 --> 02:20:23,815
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE DRY AIR, 

4177
02:20:23,815 --> 02:20:24,582
THERE IT IS. 

4178
02:20:24,582 --> 02:20:30,054
IT'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER, 

4179
02:20:30,054 --> 02:20:31,256
I BELIEVE SOME OF THIS IS 

4180
02:20:31,256 --> 02:20:32,190
LIKELY STARTING TO GET SUCKED 

4181
02:20:32,190 --> 02:20:33,324
AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE OF THAT. 

4182
02:20:33,324 --> 02:20:34,559
THAT'S WHY THE RAIN HAS STARTED 

4183
02:20:34,559 --> 02:20:35,827
TO FALL APART, ONCE WE GET 

4184
02:20:35,827 --> 02:20:36,094
OFFSHORE. 

4185
02:20:36,094 --> 02:20:37,829
ALL OF THIS STUFF IS ASSOCIATED 

4186
02:20:37,829 --> 02:20:39,397
WITH THAT STRONG TROUGH OF LOW 

4187
02:20:39,397 --> 02:20:40,298
PRESSURE IN THE UPPER LEVELS, 

4188
02:20:40,298 --> 02:20:41,299
AND THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT, 

4189
02:20:41,299 --> 02:20:42,500
WHICH WILL MAKE OUR WEATHER A 

4190
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:43,835
LOT NICER, AND EXACTLY WHAT WE 

4191
02:20:43,835 --> 02:20:54,679
NEED, WHICH IS COOLER AND DRIER.

4192
02:20:54,679 --> 02:20:56,247
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 

4193
02:20:56,247 --> 02:20:56,881
IMMEDIATELY TOMORROW, TOMORROW 

4194
02:20:56,881 --> 02:20:57,949
WE ARE GOING TO BE WARM AND 

4195
02:20:57,949 --> 02:20:59,350
HUMID, AND BY THE TIME WE GET 

4196
02:20:59,350 --> 02:21:00,485
TO TOMORROW NIGHT AND INTO 

4197
02:21:00,485 --> 02:21:01,319
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, THAT IS 

4198
02:21:01,319 --> 02:21:02,620
WHAT WE GET TO THE COOLER AND 

4199
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:03,388
DRIER, RAINFALL AMOUNTS, THE 

4200
02:21:03,388 --> 02:21:04,856
AREAS IN BLUE IS YOUR SOLID 1 

4201
02:21:04,856 --> 02:21:06,224
TO 3 INCH AMOUNTS, THIS IS A 

4202
02:21:06,224 --> 02:21:07,058
RADAR ESTIMATE, IT ALMOST 

4203
02:21:07,058 --> 02:21:08,193
ALWAYS DOES THESE NUMBERS IN 

4204
02:21:08,193 --> 02:21:09,093
TIMES OF TROPICAL RAINS, THEY 

4205
02:21:09,093 --> 02:21:10,194
SWITCHED THE MODES TO ACCOUNT 

4206
02:21:10,194 --> 02:21:11,529
FOR THAT, BUT SOME OF THE 

4207
02:21:11,529 --> 02:21:12,764
RAINFALL RATES ARE SO INTENSE 

4208
02:21:12,764 --> 02:21:13,498
THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP. 

4209
02:21:13,498 --> 02:21:14,432
DOWN TOWARD PANAMA CITY, AS 

4210
02:21:14,432 --> 02:21:15,433
MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL, THAT IS 

4211
02:21:15,433 --> 02:21:17,669
WHERE WE SEE THAT 6 TO 8 INCHES 

4212
02:21:17,669 --> 02:21:20,905
OF RAINFALL SO FAR, AND THIS IS 

4213
02:21:20,905 --> 02:21:22,273
WHAT HAS FALLEN SO FAR. 

4214
02:21:22,273 --> 02:21:23,474
FLASH FLOODING IS STILL AN 

4215
02:21:23,474 --> 02:21:26,477
ISSUE OFFICIALLY, TALLAHASSEE 

4216
02:21:26,477 --> 02:21:28,112
HAS PICKED UP 2.9 INCHES OF 

4217
02:21:28,112 --> 02:21:29,146
RAINFALL, ONE POINT -- KEEP IN 

4218
02:21:29,146 --> 02:21:32,717
MIND, NOT GETTING THE WEATHER 

4219
02:21:32,717 --> 02:21:36,821
DATA ANYMORE FROM APALACHICOLA, 

4220
02:21:36,821 --> 02:21:38,089
OR ANY DATA FROM MARIANNA, THE 

4221
02:21:38,089 --> 02:21:38,990
LAST REPORT, 1.62 INCHES OF 

4222
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:40,558
RAINFALL, THAT WILL DOUBLE OR 

4223
02:21:40,558 --> 02:21:41,759
TRIPLE EASILY AS THE EYEWALL 

4224
02:21:41,759 --> 02:21:43,394
GETS CLOSER TO YOU. 

4225
02:21:43,394 --> 02:21:50,401
HEADED DOWN, NOT LITERALLY, BUT 

4226
02:21:50,401 --> 02:21:51,069
FIGURATIVELY HEADING DOWN 

4227
02:21:51,069 --> 02:21:51,970
TOWARD THE COAST, KEEPING AN 

4228
02:21:51,970 --> 02:21:53,171
EYE ON THE APPROACHING HIGH 

4229
02:21:53,171 --> 02:21:56,474
TIDES FOR APALACHICOLA, RIGHT 

4230
02:21:56,474 --> 02:21:58,009
AT HIGH TIDE RIGHT NOW IN ST. 

4231
02:21:58,009 --> 02:21:59,043
MARK'S, THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS 

4232
02:21:59,043 --> 02:22:00,244
IN PARTICULAR WE ARE CONCERNED 

4233
02:22:00,244 --> 02:22:01,446
ABOUT FOR SURGE, IT HAS SOME OF 

4234
02:22:01,446 --> 02:22:02,780
THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL STORM 

4235
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:05,550
SURGE OF ANYWHERE ALONG THE 

4236
02:22:05,550 --> 02:22:06,517
U.S. COAST, BECAUSE OF THE 

4237
02:22:06,517 --> 02:22:13,491
SHAPE OF THE BAY, BECAUSE OF THE

4238
02:22:13,491 --> 02:22:14,258
SHALLOW CONTINENTAL SHELF, AND 

4239
02:22:14,258 --> 02:22:15,426
BECAUSE OF THE TERRAIN THERE, 

4240
02:22:15,426 --> 02:22:16,861
THE WATER JUST KEEPS GETTING 

4241
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:17,528
PUSHED UP FARTHER AND FARTHER. 

4242
02:22:17,528 --> 02:22:18,730
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AREA. 

4243
02:22:18,730 --> 02:22:20,365
AT THE TOP OF THIS CONCAVE 

4244
02:22:20,365 --> 02:22:22,667
SHAPE OF APPALACHIA BAY, BUT 

4245
02:22:22,667 --> 02:22:23,701
REGARDLESS, ALL THE WATER THAT 

4246
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:24,902
HAS BEEN PUSHED UP FROM THE 

4247
02:22:24,902 --> 02:22:26,471
GULF OF MEXICO HAS GOTTEN UP IN 

4248
02:22:26,471 --> 02:22:27,839
THAT BAY AND NOW HAS NOWHERE TO 

4249
02:22:27,839 --> 02:22:29,040
GO, AND THE WIND KEEPS PUSHING 

4250
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:29,240
IT. 

4251
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:31,009
THE WATER WILL CONTINUE TO RISE 

4252
02:22:31,009 --> 02:22:35,013
THROUGHOUT FRANKLIN COUNTY, WE 

4253
02:22:35,013 --> 02:22:36,547
HAD A REPORT OF SURGE REPORTS 

4254
02:22:36,547 --> 02:22:37,348
NEAR ALLIGATOR POINT OF 10 

4255
02:22:37,348 --> 02:22:38,650
FEET, THAT IS NOT SURPRISING AT 

4256
02:22:38,650 --> 02:22:38,850
ALL. 

4257
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:42,320
TO BE HONEST, THIS 12 FEET MAY 

4258
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:43,488
BE TOO LOW FOR AREAS AROUND ST. 

4259
02:22:43,488 --> 02:22:44,288
MARK'S AND SOUTHEASTERN PARTS 

4260
02:22:44,288 --> 02:22:46,190
OF THE COUNTY, WE COULD SEE 13 

4261
02:22:46,190 --> 02:22:47,892
TO 14 FEET, AND THE SURGE IS 

4262
02:22:47,892 --> 02:22:49,327
ALSO A SERIOUS LIFE-THREATENING 

4263
02:22:49,327 --> 02:22:51,529
SITUATION THROUGHOUT PARTS OF 

4264
02:22:51,529 --> 02:22:57,135
COASTAL TAYLOR COUNTY. 

4265
02:22:57,135 --> 02:22:58,202
HERE ARE THE CURRENT WINDS, NOW 

4266
02:22:58,202 --> 02:22:59,203
WE SEE SUSTAINED WINDS IN 

4267
02:22:59,203 --> 02:22:59,804
TALLAHASSEE ABOVE TROPICAL 

4268
02:22:59,804 --> 02:23:04,309
STORM FORCE AT 41. 

4269
02:23:04,309 --> 02:23:05,510
THE REST OF THE AREA, GENERALLY 

4270
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:06,477
SPEAKING, THE WINDS AREN'T SO 

4271
02:23:06,477 --> 02:23:08,279
BAD, KEEP IN MIND, WE ARE 

4272
02:23:08,279 --> 02:23:09,447
MISSING STATIONS NOW DUE TO THE 

4273
02:23:09,447 --> 02:23:10,381
PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH A 

4274
02:23:10,381 --> 02:23:10,814
TROPICAL SYSTEM. 

4275
02:23:10,814 --> 02:23:11,916
UNFORTUNATELY, LOOK AT THE WIND 

4276
02:23:11,916 --> 02:23:12,850
GUSTS, THERE IS THAT MOST 

4277
02:23:12,850 --> 02:23:15,219
RECENT WIND GUSTS, 71 MILES PER 

4278
02:23:15,219 --> 02:23:16,721
HOUR,  I'VE HEARD THE WIND HERE 

4279
02:23:16,721 --> 02:23:17,889
AT OUR STATION, WHICH WAS NEAR 

4280
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:21,192
THE FLYOVER, IN TALLAHASSEE, I 

4281
02:23:21,192 --> 02:23:23,594
COULD FEEL THE BUILDING SHAKING 

4282
02:23:23,594 --> 02:23:24,962
WITH SOME OF THE GUSTS WITHIN 

4283
02:23:24,962 --> 02:23:26,764
THE LAST 20 MINUTES. 

4284
02:23:26,764 --> 02:23:27,898
LIKELY SOME OF THOSE GUSTS HAVE 

4285
02:23:27,898 --> 02:23:29,901
EXCEEDED 70 MILES PER HOUR.  

4286
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:32,103
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS 

4287
02:23:32,103 --> 02:23:33,538
TALLAHASSEE, WHICH IS A FAIR 

4288
02:23:33,538 --> 02:23:36,974
DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE CORE OF 

4289
02:23:36,974 --> 02:23:38,042
THE STRONGEST WINDS, WHICH ARE 

4290
02:23:38,042 --> 02:23:39,210
STILL BACK OVER CALHOUN AND 

4291
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:39,577
JACKSON COUNTY. 

4292
02:23:39,577 --> 02:23:44,215
THAT SHOWS YOU THAT 30 TO 40 

4293
02:23:44,215 --> 02:23:45,316
MILES AWAY FROM THE CORE, YOU 

4294
02:23:45,316 --> 02:23:47,285
ARE GOING TO SEE THOSE WIND 

4295
02:23:47,285 --> 02:23:49,220
GUSTS, THAT WILL BE NEAR OR 

4296
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:49,921
EXCEED HURRICANE FORCE, 

4297
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:52,757
EXCEEDING 75 MILES PER HOUR.  

4298
02:23:52,757 --> 02:23:54,192
THOSE TYPES OF WINDS ARE VERY 

4299
02:23:54,192 --> 02:23:55,026
LIKELY ACROSS PARTS OF 

4300
02:23:55,026 --> 02:23:55,693
SOUTHWEST GEORGIA, THIS 

4301
02:23:55,693 --> 02:23:57,228
EVENING, WHAT THE FUTURE CAST, 

4302
02:23:57,228 --> 02:23:59,831
THIS GOES OUT ROUGHLY AN HOUR 

4303
02:23:59,831 --> 02:24:04,102
OR SO TO START, AND IT SHOWS 50 

4304
02:24:04,102 --> 02:24:05,570
OR 60 MILES PER HOUR WINDS FROM 

4305
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:10,074
TALLAHASSEE, UP INTO SOUTHWEST 

4306
02:24:10,074 --> 02:24:14,545
GEORGIA,  WHILE NOT AS STRONG, 

4307
02:24:14,545 --> 02:24:15,179

4357
02:27:31,242 --> 02:27:32,443
LOOK, THIS IS DAMAGE AT THE 

4358
02:27:32,443 --> 02:27:33,778
HOME ON TALLAHASSEE THAT IS ON 

4359
02:27:33,778 --> 02:27:37,014
THE WEST SIDE OF THE CITY, I 

4360
02:27:37,014 --> 02:27:38,282
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS UNDER A 

4361
02:27:38,282 --> 02:27:39,817
CARPORT, OR IF THAT IS WHAT IS 

4362
02:27:39,817 --> 02:27:42,386
LEFT OF THEIR GARAGE, WHILE.

, GOING TO DIG MAJOR CLEANUP 

4365
02:27:46,223 --> 02:27:49,694
AND A MAJOR INSURANCE CLAIM, I 

4366
02:27:49,694 --> 02:27:51,128
WOULD HOPE, AND I WOULD THINK. 

4367
02:27:51,128 --> 02:27:54,966
THIS JUST REMINDS ME OF THAT 

4368
02:27:54,966 --> 02:27:56,067
SITUATION, HOW MANY TREES AND 

4369
02:27:56,067 --> 02:27:58,269
POWER LINES WE HAD DOWN, AND 

4370
02:27:58,269 --> 02:27:59,203
THE SORT OF THING WHERE THE 

4371
02:27:59,203 --> 02:28:00,604
TREES WERE COMING DOWN LEFT AND 

4372
02:28:00,604 --> 02:28:01,037
RIGHT ON HOMES. 

4373
02:28:01,037 --> 02:28:06,177
>> AND ON CARS. 

4374
02:28:06,177 --> 02:28:07,979
>> WE HOPE YOU ARE ALL SAFE, I 

4375
02:28:07,979 --> 02:28:09,480
WANTED TO MENTION, THE CITY OF

4377
02:28:10,113 --> 02:28:11,582
TO-ONE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN TO

4379
02:28:13,017 --> 02:28:13,250
STORM. 

4380
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:14,218
THAT GIVES YOU SOME IDEA HOW 

4381
02:28:14,218 --> 02:28:15,820
WIDESPREAD THE DAMAGE IS, AND 

4382
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:17,655
COULD BE. 

4383
02:28:17,655 --> 02:28:19,123
>> THERE OBVIOUSLY PREPARING 

4384
02:28:19,123 --> 02:28:23,294
FOR THE WORST, ALICIA TURNER IS 

4385
02:28:23,294 --> 02:28:24,228
MONITORING THINGS IN 

4386
02:28:24,228 --> 02:28:25,529
TALLAHASSEE FOR US. 

4387
02:28:25,529 --> 02:28:27,565
SHE IS LIVE DOWNTOWN RIGHT NOW, 

4388
02:28:27,565 --> 02:28:29,600
HOW ARE YOU DOING, IT LOOKS 

4389
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:33,037
WINDY. 

4390
02:28:33,037 --> 02:28:34,705
>> JULIAN, IT IS WINDY, THESE 

4391
02:28:34,705 --> 02:28:35,573
GUSTS ARE PICKING UP EVERY 

4392
02:28:35,573 --> 02:28:42,113
COUPLE OF MINUTES, AND I WAS 

4393
02:28:42,113 --> 02:28:43,847
HIT BY THE DOOR AS I WAS TRYING 

4394
02:28:43,847 --> 02:28:45,182
TO GET OUT ONTO THE BALCONY, 

4395
02:28:45,182 --> 02:28:46,183
BECAUSE THE WIND GUSTS WERE 

4396
02:28:46,183 --> 02:28:46,717
COMING. 

4397
02:28:46,717 --> 02:28:48,185
I'M OKAY, BUT IT GOES TO SHOW 

4398
02:28:48,185 --> 02:28:49,186
YOU HOW QUICKLY THOSE WIND 

4399
02:28:49,186 --> 02:28:50,521
GUSTS CAN HAPPEN, AND IT CAN 

4400
02:28:50,521 --> 02:28:52,156
ALMOST KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET. 

4401
02:28:52,156 --> 02:28:53,490
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK BEHIND ME, 

4402
02:28:53,490 --> 02:28:55,026
YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW THAT RAIN 

4403
02:28:55,026 --> 02:28:56,027
IS COMING IN SIDEWAYS RIGHT 

4404
02:28:56,027 --> 02:28:59,497
NOW, AND YOU CAN GET A GOOD IDEA

4405
02:28:59,497 --> 02:29:00,497
, ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT RAINING 

4406
02:29:00,497 --> 02:29:01,532
HARD, THAT WIND IS DEFINITELY 

4407
02:29:01,532 --> 02:29:06,604
COMING THROUGH IN THE AREA NOW, 

4408
02:29:06,604 --> 02:29:07,805
SINCE I'VE BEEN OUT HERE, WE 

4409
02:29:07,805 --> 02:29:08,439
HAVE HEARD LOTS OF 

4410
02:29:08,439 --> 02:29:09,507
TRANSFORMERS, THERE ARE QUITE A 

4411
02:29:09,507 --> 02:29:10,641
FEW PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER, AND 

4412
02:29:10,641 --> 02:29:11,776
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 

4413
02:29:11,776 --> 02:29:12,810
THERE'S A LOT OF DEBRIS 

4414
02:29:12,810 --> 02:29:13,844
EVERYWHERE, SO MAKE SURE YOU 

4415
02:29:13,844 --> 02:29:19,951
WANT TO AVOID THOSE AREAS, AS 

4416
02:29:19,951 --> 02:29:20,717
FAR AS THE WIND GUSTS GO, YOU 

4417
02:29:20,717 --> 02:29:22,019
CAN'T EVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING 

4418
02:29:22,019 --> 02:29:23,654
TO HAPPEN, AND THAT'S ONE OF 

4419
02:29:23,654 --> 02:29:24,355
THE MAIN REASONS YOU WANT TO 

4420
02:29:24,355 --> 02:29:24,789
REMAIN INDOORS. 

4421
02:29:24,789 --> 02:29:26,157
THAT WIND CAN COME, AND IT CAN 

4422
02:29:26,157 --> 02:29:27,558
KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET JUST 

4423
02:29:27,558 --> 02:29:29,193
LIKE IT'S DOING FOR ME, AND 

4424
02:29:29,193 --> 02:29:30,061
MICHAEL RIGHT NOW. 

4425
02:29:30,061 --> 02:29:31,562
IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE 

4426
02:29:31,562 --> 02:29:32,229
THINGS WHERE IT COMES AND GOES, 

4427
02:29:32,229 --> 02:29:34,398
AND IT CAN GET REALLY INTENSE. 

4428
02:29:34,398 --> 02:29:36,500
FOR RIGHT NOW, THE RAIN IS 

4429
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:37,268
LIGHTER THAN WHAT IT WAS 

4430
02:29:37,268 --> 02:29:42,139
EARLIER, THIS AFTERNOON, AND IT 

4431
02:29:42,139 --> 02:29:43,240
HASN'T REALLY PICKED UP TOO 

4432
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:44,408
MUCH, BUT THE WIND CERTAINLY 

4433
02:29:44,408 --> 02:29:44,608
HAS. 

4434
02:29:44,608 --> 02:29:48,112
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT CAN COME AND 

4435
02:29:48,112 --> 02:29:49,447
GO, AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN 

4436
02:29:49,447 --> 02:29:50,514
DEALING WITH OUT HERE. 

4437
02:29:50,514 --> 02:29:51,816
FOR NOW, I'LL SEND IT BACK TO 

4438
02:29:51,816 --> 02:29:52,482
YOU IN THE STUDIO. 

4439
02:29:52,482 --> 02:29:56,253
>> STAY SAFE, AND PUT THIS IN 

4440
02:29:56,253 --> 02:29:57,521
PERSPECTIVE, WE ARE GETTING 

4441
02:29:57,521 --> 02:29:58,255
WINDS AND GUSTS 50, 70 MILES 

4442
02:29:58,255 --> 02:30:01,525
PER HOUR  HERE, THIS STORM HAS 

4443
02:30:01,525 --> 02:30:02,460
WINDS TOPPING 100 MILES PER 

4444
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:05,296
HOUR,  HOW POWERFUL THAT THESE 

4445
02:30:05,296 --> 02:30:08,332
WINDS ARE AS THEY ARE COMING TO 

4446
02:30:08,332 --> 02:30:09,200
TALLAHASSEE, EVEN THIS MANY 

4447
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,300
MILES FROM THE COAST. 

4448
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:13,170
>> WE ARE A GOOD DISTANCE FROM 

4449
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:14,738
THE CENTER OF THE STORM, SO 

4450
02:30:14,738 --> 02:30:16,340
THAT'S WHY WE REALLY WORRY 

4451
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:21,145
ABOUT THE FOLKS OVER IN MEXICO 

4452
02:30:21,145 --> 02:30:22,279
BEACH, AND PANAMA CITY, AND 

4453
02:30:22,279 --> 02:30:23,514
THAT AREA, AND AS THE STORM 

4454
02:30:23,514 --> 02:30:24,047
TRACKS THROUGH SOUTHWEST 

4455
02:30:24,047 --> 02:30:26,050
GEORGIA AND BEYOND, AND 

4456
02:30:26,050 --> 02:30:27,685
EXTENSIVE REIGN OF DAMAGE THAT 

4457
02:30:27,685 --> 02:30:29,587
IS GOING TO CAUSE IN THOSE 

4458
02:30:29,587 --> 02:30:32,590
AREAS. 

4459
02:30:32,590 --> 02:30:33,224
WHERE WE GOING NEXT? 

4460
02:30:33,224 --> 02:30:34,959
LET'S GO TO EMMA WHEELER IN 

4461
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:38,195
CAIRO, SHE'S AT THE SHELTER 

4462
02:30:38,195 --> 02:30:39,430
SEEKING THE PATH OF THE STORM 

4463
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:42,166
AS IT MAKES THE BAND TOWARD THE 

4464
02:30:42,166 --> 02:30:43,334
RIGHT AS IT MOVES INLAND, IT 

4465
02:30:43,334 --> 02:30:44,634
WILL GO RIGHT OVER SOUTHWEST 

4466
02:30:44,634 --> 02:30:47,905
GEORGIA SO THEY ARE PREPARING, 

4467
02:30:47,905 --> 02:30:48,505
AND HUNKERED DOWN THERE, AND 

4468
02:30:48,505 --> 02:30:49,607
EMMA IS STANDING BY IN A 

4469
02:30:49,607 --> 02:30:50,074
SHELTER THERE. 

4470
02:30:50,074 --> 02:30:57,748
>> THIS FAMILY WORSHIP CENTER 

4471
02:30:57,748 --> 02:30:59,049
IS OPENING ITS DOORS FOR THE 

4472
02:30:59,049 --> 02:30:59,282
STORM. 

4473
02:30:59,282 --> 02:31:00,251
NEARLY 100 PEOPLE CALLING THIS 

4474
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:01,519
PLACE HOME FOR WHO KNOWS HOW 

4475
02:31:01,519 --> 02:31:01,752
LONG. 

4476
02:31:01,752 --> 02:31:02,820
ONE THING THAT PEOPLE DO KNOW 

4477
02:31:02,820 --> 02:31:04,455
IS THAT THEY ARE GLAD THEY MADE 

4478
02:31:04,455 --> 02:31:05,489
THEIR DECISION TO LEAVE HOME, 

4479
02:31:05,489 --> 02:31:06,657
AND THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE 

4480
02:31:06,657 --> 02:31:07,124
SPACE. 

4481
02:31:07,124 --> 02:31:09,593
A FULL ROOM, SAFE FROM THE 

4482
02:31:09,593 --> 02:31:09,826
STORM. 

4483
02:31:09,826 --> 02:31:11,595
>> WE COME HERE JUST TO BE ON 

4484
02:31:11,595 --> 02:31:13,164

DAMAGED SO MANY BUSINESSES, AND 

4552

STRONG THE WINDS ARE RIGHT NOW, 

4581
02:34:00,764 --> 02:34:04,802
AND I REALIZED THE CHILL A FEW 

4582
02:34:04,802 --> 02:34:06,236
MOMENTS AGO, BECAUSE I'M INSIDE 

4583
02:34:06,236 --> 02:34:09,039
THE SHELTER WITH 300 PEOPLE WHO 

4584
02:34:09,039 --> 02:34:11,475
ARE SEEKING SHELTER HERE, BUT I 

4585
02:34:11,475 --> 02:34:15,179
JUST CAME OUTSIDE, I HAD TO GET 

4586
02:34:15,179 --> 02:34:16,347
SOMETHING OUT OF THE CAR, AND 

4587
02:34:16,347 --> 02:34:17,581
I'M SITTING IN THE CAR, WE GOT 

4588
02:34:17,581 --> 02:34:22,820
TO A POINT WHERE I ALMOST FELT 

4589
02:34:22,820 --> 02:34:24,288
LIKE THE CAR WAS ABOUT TO LIFT 

4590
02:34:24,288 --> 02:34:25,722
UP OFF THE GROUND AND TAKE ME 

4591
02:34:25,722 --> 02:34:27,758
AWAY, I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW 

4592
02:34:27,758 --> 02:34:31,795
SERIOUS IT WAS, BECAUSE HERE AT 

4593
02:34:31,795 --> 02:34:32,830

4594
02:34:32,830 --> 02:34:34,097

4598
02:34:40,170 --> 02:34:44,841
TO THE SHELTER, BUT REALIZING, 

4599
02:34:44,841 --> 02:34:46,009
1st OF ALL, IT'S NOT AS BAD AS 

4600
02:34:46,009 --> 02:34:46,810
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS, AND 

4601
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:48,645
SECONDLY,  THAT IT IS NEEDED. 

4602
02:34:48,645 --> 02:34:52,449

AT LAST CHECK, THE OFFICIAL 

4604

02:38:41,378 --> 02:38:41,778
EVER BEEN. 

4662
02:38:41,778 --> 02:38:42,579
>> THIS IS SCARY. 

4663
02:38:42,579 --> 02:38:46,216
>> THIS IS SOME OF THE WORST OF 

4664
02:38:46,216 --> 02:38:49,386
FLORENCE. 

4665
02:38:49,386 --> 02:38:50,187
>>> HELLO, EVERYONE, I'M TANYA 

4666
02:38:50,187 --> 02:38:50,420
RIVERO. 

4667
02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:51,888
WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AS THE 

4668
02:38:51,888 --> 02:38:55,892
MARKETS START TO CLOSE, THE DOW 

4669
02:38:55,892 --> 02:38:57,194
IS DOWN MORE THAN 800 POINTS. 

4670
02:38:57,194 --> 02:38:58,195
IT'S BOUNCING AROUND A LITTLE 

4671
02:38:58,195 --> 02:38:59,596
BIT BUT THIS IS THE LOWEST IT 

4672
02:38:59,596 --> 02:39:05,936
HAS BEEN SINCE APRIL.  

4673
02:39:05,936 --> 02:39:07,137
>>> AND, HURRICANE MICHAEL IS 

4674
02:39:07,137 --> 02:39:07,838
NOW MOVING THROUGH THE FLORIDA 

4675
02:39:07,838 --> 02:39:08,271
PANHANDLE. 

4676
02:39:08,271 --> 02:39:08,938
THE CATASTROPHIC CATEGORY FOUR 

4677
02:39:08,938 --> 02:39:09,940
STORM IS POUNDING PANAMA CITY 

4678
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:10,941
WITH HEAVY RAIN AND DESTRUCTIVE 

4679
02:39:10,941 --> 02:39:11,274
WINDS. 

4680
02:39:11,274 --> 02:39:12,142
HURRICANE MICHAEL HAS ALREADY 

4681
02:39:12,142 --> 02:39:13,043
KNOCKED OUT POWER FOR MORE THAN 

4682
02:39:13,043 --> 02:39:17,514
173,000 CUSTOMERS,  OFFICIALS 

4683
02:39:17,514 --> 02:39:18,681
FEEL -- FEAR BUILDINGS 

4684
02:39:18,681 --> 02:39:19,616
CONSTRUCTED BEFORE 2001 WILL 

4685
02:39:19,616 --> 02:39:21,218
NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE 

4686
02:39:21,218 --> 02:39:22,719
POWERFUL WINDS. 

4687
02:39:22,719 --> 02:39:23,754
MICHAEL IS BEING DESCRIBED AS 

4688
02:39:23,754 --> 02:39:24,988
THE STRONGEST STORMS TO HIT THE 

4689
02:39:24,988 --> 02:39:37,100
FLORIDA PANHANDLE IN DECADES. 

4690
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:38,201
WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE IN 

4691
02:39:38,201 --> 02:39:39,169
EFFECT FOR 30 MILLION PEOPLE 

4692
02:39:39,169 --> 02:39:40,237
FROM FLORIDA'S GULF COAST, ALL 

4693
02:39:40,237 --> 02:39:41,037
THE WAY TO NORTH CAROLINA. 

4694
02:39:41,037 --> 02:39:42,072
TODAY, FEMA WARNED IT'S TOO 

4695
02:39:42,072 --> 02:39:43,473
LATE FOR PEOPLE IN THE PATH OF 

4696
02:39:43,473 --> 02:39:44,341
THE STORM TO EVACUATE. 

4697
02:39:44,341 --> 02:39:45,542
>> THE WINDOW TO EVACUATE HAS 

4698
02:39:45,542 --> 02:39:47,477
COME TO A CLOSE. 

4699
02:39:47,477 --> 02:39:49,580
I MEAN, ONCE, YOU KNOW -- IN 

4700
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:50,581
SOME CASES ON THESE BARRIER 

4701
02:39:50,581 --> 02:39:51,715
ISLANDS, THEY HAVE TO SHUT DOWN 

4702
02:39:51,715 --> 02:39:52,482
DRAWBRIDGE IS AT CERTAIN 

4703
02:39:52,482 --> 02:39:52,882
SUSTAINED WINDS. 

4704
02:39:52,882 --> 02:39:59,522
AND QUITE HONESTLY, THE OCEAN 

4705
02:39:59,522 --> 02:40:00,557
HAS ALREADY STARTED RISING, AND 

4706
02:40:00,557 --> 02:40:01,458
SOME OF THOSE AREAS 

4707
02:40:01,458 --> 02:40:02,092
ANTICIPATING THE STORM SURGE. 

4708
02:40:02,092 --> 02:40:03,927
AS I SAID, THE MOST IMPORTANT 

4709
02:40:03,927 --> 02:40:10,467
THING IS THAT YOU ARE IN AN 

4710
02:40:10,467 --> 02:40:11,969
AREA AND CAN'T GET OUT OF THAT 

4711
02:40:11,969 --> 02:40:13,303
AREA, TRY TO GET ELEVATED AND 

4712
02:40:13,303 --> 02:40:14,338
TO A FACILITY YOU THINK CAN 

4713
02:40:14,338 --> 02:40:14,972
WITHSTAND THE WIND. 

4714
02:40:14,972 --> 02:40:17,474
>> CBS NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER 

4715
02:40:17,474 --> 02:40:22,112
DAVID PARKINSON JOINS US NOW. 

4716
02:40:22,112 --> 02:40:23,513
WHAT IS THE LATEST YOU CAN TELL 

4717
02:40:23,513 --> 02:40:23,680
US? 

4718
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:24,881
WE KNOW MICHAEL HAS MADE 

4719
02:40:24,881 --> 02:40:25,148
LANDFALL. 

4720
02:40:25,148 --> 02:40:26,116
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US? 

4721
02:40:26,116 --> 02:40:27,083
>> THE STORM HAS REMAINED 

4722
02:40:27,083 --> 02:40:28,185
RELATIVELY INTACT AS IT CROSSES 

4723
02:40:28,185 --> 02:40:29,252
INTERSTATE 10 WHICH IS NOT 

4724
02:40:29,252 --> 02:40:29,953
RIGHT AT THE COAST. 

4725
02:40:29,953 --> 02:40:31,188
SO, THE STORM IS REALLY GOING 

4726
02:40:31,188 --> 02:40:32,189
TO START BEING AN IMPACTFUL 

4727
02:40:32,189 --> 02:40:32,856
INLAND WINDSTORM AS WELL. 

4728
02:40:32,856 --> 02:40:33,857
PERHAPS LONGER THAN WE WERE 

4729
02:40:33,857 --> 02:40:34,190
ANTICIPATING. 

4730
02:40:34,190 --> 02:40:35,926
SO, AS WE GO INTO THE LATE-

4731
02:40:35,926 --> 02:40:40,864
NIGHT HOURS, YOU WILL PROBABLY 

4732
02:40:40,864 --> 02:40:41,698
BE SEEING SOME DAMAGING WINDS 

4733
02:40:41,698 --> 02:40:42,265
INTO CENTRAL GEORGIA. 

4734
02:40:42,265 --> 02:40:43,467
>> HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT? 

4735
02:40:43,467 --> 02:40:54,878
>> IT'S PRETTY RARE. 

4736
02:40:54,878 --> 02:40:56,213
NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THE STORM 

4737
02:40:56,213 --> 02:40:56,880
WAS INTENSIFYING UP UNTIL 

4738
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:57,981
LANDFALL, OVER A SWAMPY AREA. 

4739
02:40:57,981 --> 02:40:58,815
SO, IT'S NOT TOTALLY UNHEARD-

4740
02:40:58,815 --> 02:40:58,982
OF. 

4741
02:40:58,982 --> 02:41:00,050
BUT ONCE YOU HIT LANDFALL, THE 

4742
02:41:00,050 --> 02:41:01,485
STORM IS SUPPOSED TO START, YOU 

4743
02:41:01,485 --> 02:41:02,085
KNOW, FALLING APART. 

4744
02:41:02,085 --> 02:41:03,286
YOU CAN SEE ON THAT RADAR RIGHT 

4745
02:41:03,286 --> 02:41:04,488
THERE, YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE 

4746
02:41:04,488 --> 02:41:05,489
WELL-DEFINED EYE ON THE STORM 

4747
02:41:05,489 --> 02:41:06,523
AND IT'S NOT WEAKENING THAT 

4748
02:41:06,523 --> 02:41:06,856
CONSIDERABLY. 

4749
02:41:06,856 --> 02:41:08,492
SO, THAT'S SOMETHING TO NOTE.  

4750
02:41:08,492 --> 02:41:10,093
AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S 

4751
02:41:10,093 --> 02:41:11,294
GOING TO TAKE DOWN TREES FOR 

4752
02:41:11,294 --> 02:41:12,529
POWER OUTAGES, IT ONLY TAKES 60 

4753
02:41:12,529 --> 02:41:16,266
OR 70 MILES AN HOUR. 

4754
02:41:16,266 --> 02:41:17,167
ANYWHERE WHERE YOU ARE SEEING 

4755
02:41:17,167 --> 02:41:18,101
THE BRIGHT ORANGE, EVEN PARTS 

4756
02:41:18,101 --> 02:41:19,469
OF THE YELLOW BANDS, YOU COULD 

4757
02:41:19,469 --> 02:41:20,871
BE EASILY SEEN WINDS OF THAT 

4758
02:41:20,871 --> 02:41:27,244
SPEED. 

4759
02:41:27,244 --> 02:41:28,678
>> SO IS IT CONTINUING TO MOVE 

4760
02:41:28,678 --> 02:41:29,679
INLAND AS A CATEGORY FOUR 

4761
02:41:29,679 --> 02:41:29,912
STORM? 

4762
02:41:29,912 --> 02:41:30,714
>> YEAH, IT IS. 

4763
02:41:30,714 --> 02:41:32,482
IT HAS NOT YET COME DOWN FROM A 

4764
02:41:32,482 --> 02:41:33,383
CATEGORY FOUR SO WINDS WOULD 

4765
02:41:33,383 --> 02:41:34,751
NEED TO DROP BELOW 130 MILES AN 

4766
02:41:34,751 --> 02:41:35,685
HOUR TO DO THAT.  

4767
02:41:35,685 --> 02:41:37,087
WE HAVE BEEN AT 155, DOWN TO 

4768
02:41:37,087 --> 02:41:37,287
150. 

4769
02:41:37,287 --> 02:41:38,288
WE WILL PROBABLY GET ANOTHER 

4770
02:41:38,288 --> 02:41:40,023
UPDATE THAT WILL TAKE IT INTO 

4771
02:41:40,023 --> 02:41:47,964
THE 140S. 

4772
02:41:47,964 --> 02:41:49,099
>> SO THEN, ARE OFFICIALS 

4773
02:41:49,099 --> 02:41:50,066
WORRYING THAT IT'S MOVING INTO 

4774
02:41:50,066 --> 02:41:51,201
AREAS WHERE THE BUILDINGS HAVE 

4775
02:41:51,201 --> 02:41:51,968
NOT BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS? 

4776
02:41:51,968 --> 02:41:52,369
>> YEAH. 

4777
02:41:52,369 --> 02:41:53,503
THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER HERE 

4778
02:41:53,503 --> 02:41:55,038
IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE 

4779
02:41:55,038 --> 02:41:56,239
WIND SPEED OF 140 OR 130 OR 

4780
02:41:56,239 --> 02:42:04,481
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT'S A 

4781
02:42:04,481 --> 02:42:05,081
VERY, VERY NARROW AREA. 

4782
02:42:05,081 --> 02:42:06,349
ONLY 10 MILES FROM THE CENTER 

4783
02:42:06,349 --> 02:42:06,950
OF THE STORM. 

4784
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:07,884
SO, IT'S A WIDESPREAD DEAL. 

4785
02:42:07,884 --> 02:42:08,952
HURRICANE FORCE WIND AREA, AND 

4786
02:42:08,952 --> 02:42:10,187
A MUCH SMALLER AREA OF THOSE 

4787
02:42:10,187 --> 02:42:10,787
REALLY SERIOUS WINDS. 

4788
02:42:10,787 --> 02:42:11,154
BUT, YEAH. 

4789
02:42:11,154 --> 02:42:12,489
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 

4790
02:42:12,489 --> 02:42:13,390
EXPECTING A STORM OF THIS 

4791
02:42:13,390 --> 02:42:13,690
INTENSITY. 

4792
02:42:13,690 --> 02:42:14,958
AND I MIGHT ADD IT'S A LITTLE 

4793
02:42:14,958 --> 02:42:15,492
BIT FASTER, TOO. 

4794
02:42:15,492 --> 02:42:16,760
WE WERE THINKING THAT PERHAPS 

4795
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:17,527
TALLAHASSEE MIGHT BE GETTING 

4796
02:42:17,527 --> 02:42:25,568
HIT SOMETIMES WHEN THE EVENING 

4797
02:42:25,568 --> 02:42:26,269
NEWS IS USUALLY ON. 

4798
02:42:26,269 --> 02:42:27,437
IT'S STARTING TO GET IMPACTED 

4799
02:42:27,437 --> 02:42:27,838
RIGHT NOW. 

4800
02:42:27,838 --> 02:42:28,939
IT'S A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF 

4801
02:42:28,939 --> 02:42:29,840
SCHEDULE, IT'S A LITTLE BIT 

4802
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:30,073
FASTER. 

4803
02:42:30,073 --> 02:42:31,441
THAT MEANS AS IT CONTINUES ITS 

4804
02:42:31,441 --> 02:42:32,342
MARCH INTO THE CAROLINAS, IT 

4805
02:42:32,342 --> 02:42:33,543
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AS FAR AS 

4806
02:42:33,543 --> 02:42:34,344
COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA BY 

4807
02:42:34,344 --> 02:42:35,278
TOMORROW MORNING AT SUNRISE, 

4808
02:42:35,278 --> 02:42:36,379
WHICH IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN 

4809
02:42:36,379 --> 02:42:37,280
WE WERE EXPECTING AS WELL. 

4810
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:38,314
>> ARE WE EXPECTING WIDESPREAD 

4811
02:42:38,314 --> 02:42:38,615
DAMAGE? 

4812
02:42:38,615 --> 02:42:39,583
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT 

4813
02:42:39,583 --> 02:42:40,917
HOW HURRICANE ANDREW SET THE 

4814
02:42:40,917 --> 02:42:45,288
STANDARD THAT ALL BUILDINGS HAD 

4815
02:42:45,288 --> 02:42:46,289
TO MEET A CATEGORY THREE 

4816
02:42:46,289 --> 02:42:47,490
STANDARD THAT THEY COULD 

4817
02:42:47,490 --> 02:42:48,090
WITHSTAND CATEGORY THREE, BUT 

4818
02:42:48,090 --> 02:42:49,192
NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT CATEGORY 

4819
02:42:49,192 --> 02:42:50,393
FOUR, AND OF COURSE THERE WERE 

4820
02:42:50,393 --> 02:42:51,294
PLENTY OF BUILDINGS THAT WERE 

4821
02:42:51,294 --> 02:42:52,495
NOT UPGRADED TO THE STANDARD. 

4822
02:42:52,495 --> 02:42:53,529
WHAT KIND OF DESTRUCTION ARE WE 

4823
02:42:53,529 --> 02:42:53,863
EXPECTING? 

4824
02:42:53,863 --> 02:42:54,664
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN 

4825
02:42:54,664 --> 02:42:56,098
MIAMI, THEY HAVE PREPARED FOR 

4826
02:42:56,098 --> 02:43:02,739
THAT, AFTER ANDREW, KEEPING IN 

4827
02:43:02,739 --> 02:43:03,840
MIND THAT THIS PART OF FLORIDA 

4828
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:05,075
HAS NEVER HAD A STORM THIS 

4829
02:43:05,075 --> 02:43:06,243
STRONG WERE EVEN CLOSE TO THIS 

4830
02:43:06,243 --> 02:43:06,676
STRONG. 

4831
02:43:06,676 --> 02:43:07,444
WE'VE BEAT THE PREVIOUS RECORD 

4832
02:43:07,444 --> 02:43:09,346
IN THAT AREA BY 30 MILES AN 

4833
02:43:09,346 --> 02:43:10,781
HOUR. 

4834
02:43:10,781 --> 02:43:11,681
SO, THEY'VE NEVER HAD A 

4835
02:43:11,681 --> 02:43:12,182
CATEGORY FOUR. 

4836
02:43:12,182 --> 02:43:13,483
THEY'VE NEVER HAD MUCH OF A 

4837
02:43:13,483 --> 02:43:14,050
STRONG CATEGORY THREE. 

4838
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:15,051
SO, THERE IS NO INSTITUTIONAL 

4839
02:43:15,051 --> 02:43:16,019
MEMORY IN THAT REGARD.  

4840
02:43:16,019 --> 02:43:17,387
THE KEY THING TO NOTE HERE IS 

4841
02:43:17,387 --> 02:43:20,957
AS WE GO INLAND, A LOT OF THE 

4842
02:43:20,957 --> 02:43:22,092
TREES CAN COME DOWN BECAUSE 

4843
02:43:22,092 --> 02:43:23,260
THEY ARE VERY LARGE, THEY ARE 

4844
02:43:23,260 --> 02:43:23,660
VERY TOP-HEAVY. 

4845
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:25,161
THERE IS A LOT OF POWER LINES 

4846
02:43:25,161 --> 02:43:30,099
THAT ARE GOING TO COME DOWN. 

4847
02:43:30,099 --> 02:43:31,367
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT ANDREW 

4848
02:43:31,367 --> 02:43:32,102
LIKE DEVASTATION, THE CARS 

4849
02:43:32,102 --> 02:43:33,103
TIPPED OVER, THE ROOFS RIPPED 

4850
02:43:33,103 --> 02:43:34,671
OFF, THE ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE 

4851
02:43:34,671 --> 02:43:50,186
DEVASTATION OF PROPERTY, THAT 

4852
02:43:50,186 --> 02:43:51,554
IS GOING TO BE LIMITED TO 

4853
02:43:51,554 --> 02:43:52,489
MEXICO BEACH AND PANAMA CITY 

4854
02:43:52,489 --> 02:43:53,056
BEACH, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY. 

4855
02:43:53,056 --> 02:43:53,790
>> WHY IS THAT? 

4856
02:43:53,790 --> 02:43:54,691
>> BECAUSE THAT'S RIGHT WHERE 

4857
02:43:54,691 --> 02:43:56,092
YOU HAVE THOSE 155 MILE AN HOUR 

4858
02:43:56,092 --> 02:43:57,260
WINDS, AND THE EYE WALL RIGHT 

4859
02:43:57,260 --> 02:43:58,094
WHERE IT CAME ON. 

4860
02:43:58,094 --> 02:43:59,062
IT'S WEAKENING AS IT GOES 

4861
02:43:59,062 --> 02:43:59,629
FURTHER INLAND. 

4862
02:43:59,629 --> 02:44:00,897
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT 

4863
02:44:00,897 --> 02:44:02,766
GOING TO CAUSE LOTS OF DAMAGE.  

4864
02:44:02,766 --> 02:44:03,900
IT'S NOT GOING TO RIP OFF 

4865
02:44:03,900 --> 02:44:04,133
ROOFS. 

4866
02:44:04,133 --> 02:44:05,168
BUT, THE UTTER DEVASTATION OF 

4867
02:44:05,168 --> 02:44:06,469
BLOCKS, LIKE YOU SAW IN ANDREW, 

4868
02:44:06,469 --> 02:44:07,337
THAT'S GOING TO BE LIMITED. 

4869
02:44:07,337 --> 02:44:08,738
>> WE HAVE SEEN SOME IMAGES OF 

4870
02:44:08,738 --> 02:44:09,739
MEXICO BEACH WITH ROOFS THAT 

4871
02:44:09,739 --> 02:44:10,574
HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED, AND 

4872
02:44:10,574 --> 02:44:11,441
FLOODING THAT IS ALREADY OVER 

4873
02:44:11,441 --> 02:44:12,142
SEVERAL STORIES HIGH. 

4874
02:44:12,142 --> 02:44:12,542
>> RIGHT. 

4875
02:44:12,542 --> 02:44:13,944
AND SO THE KEY THING WITH STORM 

4876
02:44:13,944 --> 02:44:15,178
SURGE IS THE NEXT HIGH TIDE 

4877
02:44:15,178 --> 02:44:16,479
CYCLE IS NOT UNTIL 6 P.M. 

4878
02:44:16,479 --> 02:44:16,812
CENTRAL TIME. 

4879
02:44:16,812 --> 02:44:17,881
SO, EVEN IF THE SEARCH STARTS 

4880
02:44:17,881 --> 02:44:19,683
TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AS THE 

4881
02:44:19,683 --> 02:44:20,950
STORE MAKES ITS WAY FURTHER 

4882
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:22,786
INLAND, UNFORTUNATELY, THE 

4883
02:44:22,786 --> 02:44:23,787
FLODDING THREAT IS NOT REALLY 

4884
02:44:23,787 --> 02:44:24,888
GOING TO RELAX ITSELF UNTIL YOU 

4885
02:44:24,888 --> 02:44:26,990
GET TO THE NIGHT. 

4886
02:44:26,990 --> 02:44:28,491
IN A LOT OF PLACES, YOU ARE 

4887
02:44:28,491 --> 02:44:29,993
GOING TO START TO BE ABLE TO 

4888
02:44:29,993 --> 02:44:30,894
SURVEY SOME DAMAGE, IF LOCAL 

4889
02:44:30,894 --> 02:44:34,631
OFFICIALS SAY IT'S OKAY. 

4890
02:44:34,631 --> 02:44:35,365
TONIGHT, AND CERTAINLY BY 

4891
02:44:35,365 --> 02:44:37,000
TOMORROW, THE WINDS WILL BE 

4892
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:41,938
BELOW THE THRESHOLD TO CLOSE 

4893
02:44:41,938 --> 02:44:42,271
THE BRIDGES. 

4894
02:44:42,271 --> 02:44:43,673
BUT, SO MANY ROADS ARE GOING TO 

4895
02:44:43,673 --> 02:44:44,541
BE COVERED IN DEBRIS. 

4896
02:44:44,541 --> 02:44:46,176
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SAFE TO BE 

4897
02:44:46,176 --> 02:45:01,691
WALKING OR DRIVING AROUND, EVEN 

4898
02:45:01,691 --> 02:45:03,059
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 

4899
02:45:03,059 --> 02:45:03,860
ABOUT THE WIND THREATS. 

4900
02:45:03,860 --> 02:45:04,561
PLEASE LISTEN TO LOCAL 

4901
02:45:04,561 --> 02:45:05,095
OFFICIALS ON THAT. 

4902
02:45:05,095 --> 02:45:05,795
>> SO SCARY. 

4903
02:45:05,795 --> 02:45:06,896
I REALLY AM WORRIED ABOUT FOLKS 

4904
02:45:06,896 --> 02:45:08,164
THERE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE 

4905
02:45:08,164 --> 02:45:09,499
A LOT OF TIME TO PREPARE ON 

4906
02:45:09,499 --> 02:45:10,066
THIS ONE. 

4907
02:45:10,066 --> 02:45:10,299
>> NO. 

4908
02:45:10,299 --> 02:45:11,501
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT PEOPLE 

4909
02:45:11,501 --> 02:45:12,602
HEEDED WARNINGS WHEN THEY WERE 

4910
02:45:12,602 --> 02:45:12,868
THERE. 

4911
02:45:12,868 --> 02:45:13,469
LOOKS, THIS STORM EXCEEDED 

4912
02:45:13,469 --> 02:45:14,070
EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS BUT 

4913
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:15,238
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO TAKE 

4914
02:45:15,238 --> 02:45:16,039
EVERY HURRICANE SERIOUSLY.  

4915
02:45:16,039 --> 02:45:17,440
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT'S 

4916
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,808
GOING TO HAVE A KICK IN THAT 

4917
02:45:18,808 --> 02:45:19,142
LAST BIT. 

4918
02:45:19,142 --> 02:45:19,943
YOU WOULD ALWAYS RATHER 

4919
02:45:19,943 --> 02:45:21,244
EVACUATE AND BE SAFE THAN HAVE 

4920
02:45:21,244 --> 02:45:22,111
NOT EVACUATED AND NEED HELP. 

4921
02:45:22,111 --> 02:45:23,113
CLEARLY, IF YOU SAW THOSE 

4922
02:45:23,113 --> 02:45:24,280
PICTURES, NOBODY WAS GOING TO 

4923
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:25,682
HELP YOU WHEN THE STORM WAS AT 

4924
02:45:25,682 --> 02:45:25,982
ITS WORST. 

4925
02:45:25,982 --> 02:45:26,316
>> INDEED. 

4926
02:45:26,316 --> 02:45:27,283
DAVID PARKINSON, THANK YOU SO 

4927
02:45:27,283 --> 02:45:28,184

4928
02:45:28,184 --> 02:45:29,519
I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE 

4929
02:45:29,519 --> 02:45:30,587

4932
02:45:32,389 --> 02:45:33,056
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

4933
02:45:33,056 --> 02:45:33,957
>> SUPPORTED BY AREA, FUEL, 

4934
02:45:33,957 --> 02:45:34,758
CAPABILITY, AND SWIFT WATER 

4935
02:45:34,758 --> 02:45:35,291
RESCUE BOATS, THROUGHOUT 

4936
02:45:35,291 --> 02:45:35,892
IMMEDIATE LIFESAVING SUPPORT 

4937

FOR HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

4938
02:45:42,966 --> 02:45:44,434
THIS IS INDEED A COLLABORATIVE 

4939
02:45:44,434 --> 02:45:45,034
EFFORT AND WE ARE INTEGRATING 

4940
02:45:45,034 --> 02:45:46,102
WITH THE U.S. COAST GUARD AS 

4941
02:45:46,102 --> 02:45:47,070
THE LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY. 

4942
02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:48,038
THE COAST GUARD IS DIRECTED BY

AND WHILE WE ARE DIFFERENT 

4946
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:51,741
DEPARTMENTS, LET THERE BE NO 

4947
02:45:51,741 --> 02:45:52,842
DOUBT THAT WE ARE FULLY 

4948
02:45:52,842 --> 02:45:53,376

NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE ANY 

4983
02:46:47,897 --> 02:46:49,065

>> GENERAL BOB BURNS WITH AP. 

4986
02:46:50,800 --> 02:46:52,502
YOU MENTIONED TYNDALE. 

4987
02:46:52,502 --> 02:46:54,169
AND HE SAID THAT THE HOMELAND

>> OKAY, AIR OPERATIONS CENTER, 

4991
02:47:03,313 --> 02:47:05,682
HAS BEEN MOVED. 

4992
02:47:05,682 --> 02:47:06,783
AT BOTH TYNDALE, ENGLAND, AND 

4993
02:47:06,783 --> 02:47:07,049
HURLBERT. 

4994
02:47:07,049 --> 02:47:07,784
HAVE YOU ESSENTIALLY EVACUATED 

4995
02:47:07,784 --> 02:47:08,151
THOSE AREAS? 

4996
02:47:08,151 --> 02:47:21,498
OR DO THEY STILL HAVE PRIORITY? 

4997
02:47:21,498 --> 02:47:22,932
>> LET ME START WITH THE AIR 

4998
02:47:22,932 --> 02:47:23,566
OPERATIONS CENTER' CAPABILITY. 

4999
02:47:23,566 --> 02:47:23,899
-- CAPACITY. 

5000
02:47:23,899 --> 02:47:24,768
WE LOOK ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL 

5001
02:47:24,768 --> 02:47:25,869
U.S., AND WE HAVE OTHER NOTES 

5002
02:47:25,869 --> 02:47:27,170
AND OTHER PLACES WHERE WE CAN 

5003
02:47:27,170 --> 02:47:28,138
ACTUALLY DO THE SAME COMMAND 

5004
02:47:28,138 --> 02:47:29,572
AND CONTROL MISSION SET, AND 

5005
02:47:29,572 --> 02:47:33,276
SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION IN. 

5006
02:47:33,276 --> 02:47:34,244
BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION, I 

5007
02:47:34,244 --> 02:47:35,278
CAN'T TELL YOU THE SPECIFIC 

5008
02:47:35,278 --> 02:47:36,679
BASE THAT IS TRANSFERRED TO BUT 

5009
02:47:36,679 --> 02:47:37,847
WE DID DO THAT LAST NIGHT. 

5010
02:47:37,847 --> 02:47:38,715
BEFORE THE STORM ARRIVED WE 

5011
02:47:38,715 --> 02:47:39,315
TRANSFER THAT COMMUNICATION 

5012
02:47:39,315 --> 02:47:41,518
CONTROL CAPABILITY TO ANOTHER 

5013
02:47:41,518 --> 02:47:45,755
FACILITY. 

5014
02:47:45,755 --> 02:47:46,756
WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL 

5015
02:47:46,756 --> 02:47:47,256
BASIS, EACH INDIVIDUAL 

5016
02:47:47,256 --> 02:47:47,991
INSTALLATION COMMANDER HAS 

5017
02:47:47,991 --> 02:47:48,758
GIVEN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO 

5018
02:47:48,758 --> 02:47:49,859
THEIR BASES, AND DEPENDING ON 

5019
02:47:49,859 --> 02:47:50,693
EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE FOR 

5020
02:47:50,693 --> 02:47:51,795
EXAMPLE, TYNDALL, RIGHT IN THE 

5021
02:47:51,795 --> 02:47:55,765
PATH OF THE STORM, HAD  BOTH 

5022
02:47:55,765 --> 02:47:56,366
PERSONNEL AND FAMILIES 

5023
02:47:56,366 --> 02:47:57,066
ASSOCIATE, -- EVACUATE, WHERE 

5024
02:47:57,066 --> 02:47:57,967
OTHERS HAVE LESS EVACUATE. 

5025
02:47:57,967 --> 02:47:59,068
THAT IS UP TO THE LOCAL 

5026
02:47:59,068 --> 02:47:59,769
INSTALLATION COMMANDERS IN 

5027
02:47:59,769 --> 02:48:02,072
COORDINATION WITH LOCAL 

5028
02:48:02,072 --> 02:48:05,942
OFFICIALS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 

5029
02:48:05,942 --> 02:48:06,208
GOVERNOR. 

5030
02:48:06,208 --> 02:48:07,544
>> WHAT DO THEY DO IN ENGLAND 

5031
02:48:07,544 --> 02:48:07,944
VERSUS HURLBURT? 

5032
02:48:07,944 --> 02:48:09,279
>>> HILLARY LANE JOINS US NOW 

5033
02:48:09,279 --> 02:48:09,946
FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH, 

5034
02:48:09,946 --> 02:48:10,212
FLORIDA. 

5035
02:48:10,212 --> 02:48:20,056
HI, HILLARY.  

5036
02:48:20,056 --> 02:48:21,491
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 

5037
02:48:21,491 --> 02:48:22,158
SEEING AND EXPERIENCING THERE? 

5038
02:48:22,158 --> 02:48:23,259
>> Reporter: TANYA, A VERY 

5039
02:48:23,259 --> 02:48:23,960
DIFFERENT SITE COMPARED TO 

5040
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:24,894
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. 

5041
02:48:24,894 --> 02:48:26,162
THE WORST OF THE STORM HAS 

5042
02:48:26,162 --> 02:48:26,462
PASSED US. 

5043
02:48:26,462 --> 02:48:27,497
REALLY JUST SOME LIGHT RAIN 

5044
02:48:27,497 --> 02:48:27,697
NOW. 

5045
02:48:27,697 --> 02:48:28,965
AND THE PALM TREES I CAN SEE 

5046
02:48:28,965 --> 02:48:42,011
OVER MY SHOULDER ARE BLOWING. 

5047
02:48:42,011 --> 02:48:43,413
BUT BEFORE THAT AROUND NOON 

5048
02:48:43,413 --> 02:48:44,080
TODAY, THERE WAS WIND WHIPPING 

5049
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:44,380
ACROSS. 

5050
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:45,848
WE COULDN'T EVEN COME OUTSIDE 

5051
02:48:45,848 --> 02:48:46,583
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE JUST TOO 

5052
02:48:46,583 --> 02:48:46,883
DANGEROUS. 

5053
02:48:46,883 --> 02:48:48,184
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THIS 

5054
02:48:48,184 --> 02:48:49,485
ROOF WAS BLOWING IN THE WIND A 

5055
02:48:49,485 --> 02:48:50,286
LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY. 

5056
02:48:50,286 --> 02:48:51,654
IT POPPED OFF QUITE A BIT. 

5057
02:48:51,654 --> 02:48:52,722
YOU SEE STREET SIGNS IN THIS 

5058
02:48:52,722 --> 02:48:53,523
AREA, ON THE GROUND. 

5059
02:48:53,523 --> 02:48:54,757
SO MANY SIGNS HANGING ON A 

5060
02:48:54,757 --> 02:48:55,024
DIAGONAL. 

5061
02:48:55,024 --> 02:48:56,092
EARLIER TODAY, IT WAS A VERY, 

5062
02:48:56,092 --> 02:48:56,759
VERY SCARY SCENE. 

5063
02:48:56,759 --> 02:48:57,894
BUT AS IT PASSED THROUGH US, 

5064
02:48:57,894 --> 02:48:58,962
RIGHT NOW, MUCH, MUCH CALMER. 

5065
02:48:58,962 --> 02:49:00,296
>> AND THE AREA WHERE YOU ARE, 

5066
02:49:00,296 --> 02:49:01,397
IS IT PRETTY MUCH FULLY 

5067
02:49:01,397 --> 02:49:01,697
EVACUATED? 

5068
02:49:01,697 --> 02:49:01,998
>> YES. 

5069
02:49:01,998 --> 02:49:03,466
SO, MUCH OF THE AREA, WE WERE 

5070
02:49:03,466 --> 02:49:05,068
AT A HOTEL LAST NIGHT, AN 

5071
02:49:05,068 --> 02:49:05,468
EVACUATION ZONE. 

5072
02:49:05,468 --> 02:49:06,569
MANY PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH THERE 

5073
02:49:06,569 --> 02:49:07,203
WAS A MANDATORY EVACUATION 

5074
02:49:07,203 --> 02:49:08,438
AREA, DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. 

5075
02:49:08,438 --> 02:49:09,038
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS. 

5076
02:49:09,038 --> 02:49:10,039
SOE HAD ELDERLY FAMILY 

5077
02:49:10,039 --> 02:49:11,508
MEMBERS, SOME JUST WANTED TO 

5078
02:49:11,508 --> 02:49:12,842
RIDE THE STORM OUT. 

5079
02:49:12,842 --> 02:49:13,943
A LOT OF PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH 

5080
02:49:13,943 --> 02:49:14,843
THEY WERE IN THE MANDATORY 

5081
02:49:14,843 --> 02:49:15,578
EVACUATION AREAS, DECIDED 

5082
02:49:15,578 --> 02:49:15,844
TUESDAY. 

5083
02:49:15,844 --> 02:49:23,286
RIGHT HERE, WE ARE IN -- NOT IN 

5084
02:49:23,286 --> 02:49:24,220
A MANDATORY EVACUATION AREA, SO 

5085
02:49:24,220 --> 02:49:25,455
MORE PEOPLE ARE IN THIS AREA. 

5086
02:49:25,455 --> 02:49:26,856
>> WHAT IS THE WORST THAT YOU 

5087
02:49:26,856 --> 02:49:27,957
HAVE SEEN AND NOW THAT THE 

5088
02:49:27,957 --> 02:49:28,558
STORM HAS PASSED? 

5089
02:49:28,558 --> 02:49:29,492
IS IT MOSTLY FLOODING THAT 

5090
02:49:29,492 --> 02:49:32,729
PEOPLE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THERE? 

5091
02:49:32,729 --> 02:49:34,063
>> Reporter: I WOULD SAY THAT 

5092
02:49:34,063 --> 02:49:35,165
IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 

5093
02:49:35,165 --> 02:49:36,466
HAVE TO DO, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT 

5094
02:49:36,466 --> 02:49:37,367
COMES TO TOMORROW, WHERE PEOPLE 

5095
02:49:37,367 --> 02:49:38,468
GO OUTSIDE AND BEGIN TO 

5096
02:49:38,468 --> 02:49:38,735
REBUILD. 

5097
02:49:38,735 --> 02:49:39,769
WE'VE SEEN QUITE A BIT OF 

5098
02:49:39,769 --> 02:49:40,403
DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES. 

5099
02:49:40,403 --> 02:49:41,737
WE ARE BEING TOLD, WE HAVE BEEN 

5100
02:49:41,737 --> 02:49:42,939
ABLE TO SEE, SOME HOMES HAVE 

5101
02:49:42,939 --> 02:49:43,472
BEEN COMPLETELY LEVELED. 

5102
02:49:43,472 --> 02:49:44,707
ESPECIALLY SOME NEWER 

5103
02:49:44,707 --> 02:49:45,441
STRUCTURES. 

5104
02:49:45,441 --> 02:49:46,342
SO, WHEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE 

5105
02:49:46,342 --> 02:49:47,343
EVACUATED BEGIN TO COME BACK, 

5106
02:49:47,343 --> 02:49:48,578
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO 

5107
02:49:48,578 --> 02:49:49,946
QUITE A BIT THAT THEY ARE GOING 

5108
02:49:49,946 --> 02:49:50,747
TO NEED TO REBUILD. 

5109
02:49:50,747 --> 02:49:51,848
>> AND YOU KNOW, HILLARY, WE 

5110
02:49:51,848 --> 02:49:53,383
HEAR THAT THIS IS THE STRONGEST 

5111
02:49:53,383 --> 02:49:54,217
HURRICANE THAT HAVE MADE 

5112
02:49:54,217 --> 02:49:55,351
LANDFALL IN THE FLORIDA 

5113
02:49:55,351 --> 02:50:00,690
PANHANDLE. 

5114
02:50:00,690 --> 02:50:01,658
WHAT ARE FOLKS THERE TELLING 

5115
02:50:01,658 --> 02:50:02,191
YOU ABOUT THIS? 

5116
02:50:02,191 --> 02:50:03,459
I MEAN, HAVE THEY JUST BEEN 

5117
02:50:03,459 --> 02:50:04,327
TERRIFIED THROUGH THIS 

5118
02:50:04,327 --> 02:50:10,767
EXPERIENCE? 

5119
02:50:10,767 --> 02:50:11,467
>> Reporter: YEAH. 

5120
02:50:11,467 --> 02:50:12,301
THEY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY 

5121
02:50:12,301 --> 02:50:12,601
TERRIFYING. 

5122
02:50:12,601 --> 02:50:13,570
NOW, THE INTERESTING PART THAT 

5123
02:50:13,570 --> 02:50:14,737
PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY 

5124
02:50:14,737 --> 02:50:15,838
DID NOT HAVE TIME TO PREPARE. 

5125
02:50:15,838 --> 02:50:16,706
YOU KNOW WITH FLORENCE, 

5126
02:50:16,706 --> 02:50:17,674
PREDICTORS WERE SAYING, THIS IS 

5127
02:50:17,674 --> 02:50:19,442
GOING TO BE A STORM FOR A WEEK 

5128
02:50:19,442 --> 02:50:20,543
BUT PEOPLE WERE SAYING THEY DID 

5129
02:50:20,543 --> 02:50:21,344
NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. 

5130
02:50:21,344 --> 02:50:22,278
THEY WERE GETTING THE MANDATORY 

5131
02:50:22,278 --> 02:50:23,446
EVACUATION ORDERS THIS WEEKEND 

5132
02:50:23,446 --> 02:50:29,285
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE FIRST 

5133
02:50:29,285 --> 02:50:29,953
WORKING ABOUT IT. 

5134
02:50:29,953 --> 02:50:31,154
I THINK WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING 

5135
02:50:31,154 --> 02:50:32,054
IS, FOR SUCH A POWERFUL, 

5136
02:50:32,054 --> 02:50:32,956
GIGANTIC STORM, THEY DIDN'T 

5137
02:50:32,956 --> 02:50:33,890
HAVE A LOT TO PREPARE. 

5138
02:50:33,890 --> 02:50:34,457
>> NO, INDY. 

5139
02:50:34,457 --> 02:50:36,059
THAT IS WHAT MADE IT SO SCARY 

5140
02:50:36,059 --> 02:50:37,226
FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. 

5141
02:50:37,226 --> 02:50:39,195
CERTAINLY, IT BUILDS STRENGTH 

5142
02:50:39,195 --> 02:50:39,862
MORE THAN ANYONE COULD. 

5143
02:50:39,862 --> 02:50:41,130
MORE QUICKLY THAN ANYONE COULD 

5144
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:44,467
IMAGINE. 

5145
02:50:44,467 --> 02:50:45,668
HOW MANY HOMES DO YOU THINK 

5146
02:50:45,668 --> 02:50:46,468
THERE ARE WITHOUT POWER? 

5147
02:50:46,468 --> 02:50:47,904
ARE YOU SEEING A LOT OF POWER 

5148
02:50:47,904 --> 02:50:54,043
OUTAGES WHERE YOU ARE? 

5149
02:50:54,043 --> 02:50:54,844
>> Reporter: WE ARE. 

5150
02:50:54,844 --> 02:50:55,912
WE ARE HEARING THAT ULTIMATELY 

5151
02:50:55,912 --> 02:50:57,380
THERE IS GOING TO BE 150,000 TO 

5152
02:50:57,380 --> 02:50:58,281
200,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER IN 

5153
02:50:58,281 --> 02:50:58,848
THIS REGION. 

5154
02:50:58,848 --> 02:51:00,282
AT OUR HOTEL WHERE WE ARE 

5155
02:51:00,282 --> 02:51:02,552
STAYING, EVEN BEFORE THE WORST 

5156
02:51:02,552 --> 02:51:03,486
OF THE STORM CAME THROUGH, 

5157
02:51:03,486 --> 02:51:04,687
CERTAINLY, THIS WAS GOING TO BE 

5158
02:51:04,687 --> 02:51:05,555
A MAJOR ISSUE. 

5159
02:51:05,555 --> 02:51:06,155
WE HEARD FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR 

5160
02:51:06,155 --> 02:51:11,494
EARLIER TODAY SAYING, THE 

5161
02:51:11,494 --> 02:51:12,795
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO GET 

5162
02:51:12,795 --> 02:51:13,563
THE ELECTRICITY BACK ON. 

5163
02:51:13,563 --> 02:51:14,564
THAT'S QUITE CRUCIAL WHEN IT 

5164
02:51:14,564 --> 02:51:15,064
COMES TO REBUILDING. 

5165
02:51:15,064 --> 02:51:16,065
CERTAINLY, A LARGE NUMBER OF 

5166
02:51:16,065 --> 02:51:17,900
PEOPLE, UP TO 2000, WILL BE 

5167
02:51:17,900 --> 02:51:18,300
WITHOUT POWER. 

5168
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:19,268
THAT'S GOING TO HINDER THE 

5169
02:51:19,268 --> 02:51:20,269
REBUILDING EFFORTS LATER THIS 

5170
02:51:20,269 --> 02:51:20,469
WEEK. 

5171
02:51:20,469 --> 02:51:21,537
>> HILLARY LANE, THANK YOU SO 

5172
02:51:21,537 --> 02:51:23,005
MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE THERE. 

5173
02:51:23,005 --> 02:51:27,543
STAY SAFE. 

5174
02:51:27,543 --> 02:51:28,811
>>> LET'S TAKE YOU NOW BACK TO 

5175
02:51:28,811 --> 02:51:29,879
THE PENTAGON WHERE WE ARE 

5176
02:51:29,879 --> 02:51:31,080
GETTING AN UPDATE ON THE 

5177
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:32,081
FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THIS STORM. 

5178
02:51:32,081 --> 02:51:33,349
ONCE AGAIN, LET'S LISTEN AND. 

5179
02:51:33,349 --> 02:51:37,286
>> QUICKLY GAINED IN INTENSITY. 

5180
02:51:37,286 --> 02:51:38,354
AND WE ARE NOT SEEING THE 

5181
02:51:38,354 --> 02:51:39,589
NUMBERS IN THE SHELTERS AND WE 

5182
02:51:39,589 --> 02:51:40,690
ARE NOT SEEING THE NUMBERS 

5183
02:51:40,690 --> 02:51:41,290
NECESSARILY GOING AWAY. 

5184
02:51:41,290 --> 02:51:42,425
SO, MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS, 

5185
02:51:42,425 --> 02:51:43,659
THERE IS MANY PEOPLE IN HOM'S 

5186
02:51:43,659 --> 02:51:43,859
WAY. 

5187
02:51:43,859 --> 02:51:45,294
THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THE 

5188
02:51:45,294 --> 02:51:45,928
SEARCH AND RESCUE CAPABILITY. 

5189
02:51:45,928 --> 02:51:47,196
AND BESIDES THE HIGH WINDS AND 

5190
02:51:47,196 --> 02:51:51,567
OF COURSE WIND SPEED, EVERYONE 

5191
02:51:51,567 --> 02:51:52,902
IS SIMILAR WITH, THERE IS A 

5192
02:51:52,902 --> 02:51:54,069
SEARCH THAT IS GOING TO BE A 

5193
02:51:54,069 --> 02:51:54,537
WIDE FACTOR. 

5194
02:51:54,537 --> 02:51:55,270
AND IT'S A WIDESPREAD. 

5195
02:51:55,270 --> 02:52:05,682
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT IN THE AREA OF 

5196
02:52:05,682 --> 02:52:06,382
TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE. 

5197
02:52:06,382 --> 02:52:07,083
AND, IT'S REALLY FROM 

5198
02:52:07,083 --> 02:52:08,151
PENSACOLA, ALL THE WAY DOWN 

5199
02:52:08,151 --> 02:52:09,285
THROUGH TAMPA, WHERE THERE WILL 

5200
02:52:09,285 --> 02:52:10,286
BE SOME IMPACT FROM THE SEARCH. 

5201
02:52:10,286 --> 02:52:11,421
THAT COMBINATION OF THE WIND, 

5202
02:52:11,421 --> 02:52:12,288
THE SURGE, THE LACK OF 

5203
02:52:12,288 --> 02:52:13,156
EVACUATIONS, HAS US CONCERNED. 

5204
02:52:13,156 --> 02:52:14,757
AND,  THAT'S WHY WE ARE SO WELL 

5205
02:52:14,757 --> 02:52:15,491
PREPARED TO RESPOND. 

5206
02:52:15,491 --> 02:52:16,692
>> THAT GETS TO MY FOLLOW-UP 

5207
02:52:16,692 --> 02:52:17,627
WHICH IS, YOU TALKED ABOUT 

5208
02:52:17,627 --> 02:52:18,094
SEARCH AND RESCUE. 

5209
02:52:18,094 --> 02:52:19,462
AT -- AS YOU HAVE PLANNED 

5210
02:52:19,462 --> 02:52:20,496
AGAINST THE STORM AND YOU DON'T 

5211
02:52:20,496 --> 02:52:21,464
SEE THE MASSIVE CIVILIAN 

5212
02:52:21,464 --> 02:52:22,265
EVACUATION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE 

5213
02:52:22,265 --> 02:52:25,501
WANTED TO SEE. 

5214
02:52:25,501 --> 02:52:26,101
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING? 

5215
02:52:26,101 --> 02:52:27,170
WHAT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING, IN 

5216
02:52:27,170 --> 02:52:32,842
TERMS OF THE OVERALL FULL NEED 

5217
02:52:32,842 --> 02:52:33,543
FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE? 

5218
02:52:33,543 --> 02:52:35,044
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY 

5219
02:52:35,044 --> 02:52:36,279
PEOPLE, WHETHER IT'S YOU, OR 

5220
02:52:36,279 --> 02:52:37,547
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, OR WHOEVER, 

5221
02:52:37,547 --> 02:52:44,954
HOW MANY PEOPLE? 

5222
02:52:44,954 --> 02:52:46,289
>> I WILL SAY THAT FOR EXAMPLE, 

5223
02:52:46,289 --> 02:52:47,490
THE STATE OF FLORIDA IS VERY 

5224
02:52:47,490 --> 02:52:47,857
WELL-PREPARED. 

5225
02:52:47,857 --> 02:52:48,858
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS 

5226
02:52:48,858 --> 02:52:49,158
MANY TIMES. 

5227
02:52:49,158 --> 02:52:50,093
THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE 

5228
02:52:50,093 --> 02:52:53,529
CAPABILITY, CAPACITY. 

5229
02:52:53,529 --> 02:52:56,499
AND, QUITE FRANKLY, WE WOULD BE 

5230
02:52:56,499 --> 02:52:57,467
LESS CONCERNED, BECAUSE THEY 

5231
02:52:57,467 --> 02:52:58,067
HAVE SUCH ROBUST CAPABILITY. 

5232
02:52:58,067 --> 02:52:59,535
AND, WE SEE IT FROM THE FEDERAL 

5233
02:52:59,535 --> 02:53:00,470
SIDE, IN COORDINATION WITH 

5234
02:53:00,470 --> 02:53:00,670
FEMA. 

5235
02:53:00,670 --> 02:53:01,871
WE ARE IN DIRECT SUPPORT OF THE 

5236
02:53:01,871 --> 02:53:02,672
GOVERNORS, AND TRYING TO 

5237
02:53:02,672 --> 02:53:07,477
ANTICIPATE THEIR NEEDS. 

5238
02:53:07,477 --> 02:53:08,644
YOU CAN SEE, FROM THE REPORTS 

5239
02:53:08,644 --> 02:53:09,679
THAT HAVE BEEN OUT, THE 

5240
02:53:09,679 --> 02:53:10,613
GOVERNOR IS VERY CONCERNED 

5241
02:53:10,613 --> 02:53:11,914
ABOUT THE LACK OF EVACUATIONS. 

5242
02:53:11,914 --> 02:53:12,949
THEY HAVE THE ROBUST CAPABILITY 

5243
02:53:12,949 --> 02:53:13,483
AND CAPACITY. 

5244
02:53:13,483 --> 02:53:22,058
THEY VERY WELL ME -- MAY BE 

5245
02:53:22,058 --> 02:53:23,125
ABLE TO HANDLE THE CAPACITY. 

5246
02:53:23,125 --> 02:53:24,093
BUT, BECAUSE OF THAT, THAT'S 

5247
02:53:24,093 --> 02:53:25,361
WHY WE ARE POSTURED SO STRONGLY 

5248
02:53:25,361 --> 02:53:26,596
AND HAVE SUCH A ROBUST TEAM 

5249
02:53:26,596 --> 02:53:27,096
AROUND THE PERIMETER. 

5250
02:53:27,096 --> 02:53:28,398
>> DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE, 

5251
02:53:28,398 --> 02:53:29,265
PERHAPS, FROM, THE FEDERAL 

5252
02:53:29,265 --> 02:53:29,966
MILITARY SIDE, GIVEN THE 

5253
02:53:29,966 --> 02:53:38,241
CAPACITY YOU HAVE PUT AND HAVE 

5254
02:53:38,241 --> 02:53:39,275
ON STANDBY, WHAT COULD YOU 

5255
02:53:39,275 --> 02:53:40,276
ACCOMPLISH IN TERMS OF HOW MANY 

5256
02:53:40,276 --> 02:53:42,011
PEOPLE YOU COULD GET OUT OF 

5257
02:53:42,011 --> 02:53:53,456
HARM'S WAY? 

5258
02:53:53,456 --> 02:53:54,857
>> I DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE PUT 

5259
02:53:54,857 --> 02:53:55,124
THAT WAY. 

5260
02:53:55,124 --> 02:53:56,592
WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT FOR MORE 

5261
02:53:56,592 --> 02:53:57,960
IS OUR ABILITY, AS WE LOOK AT 

5262
02:53:57,960 --> 02:53:58,728
BOTH THE LOCAL RESPONSE 

5263
02:53:58,728 --> 02:53:59,695
CAPABILITY, AND AS THE STORM 

5264
02:53:59,695 --> 02:54:00,963
COMES THROUGH, WE ARE GOING TO 

5265
02:54:00,963 --> 02:54:01,697
SEE THAT, UNLIKE FLORENCE, 

5266
02:54:01,697 --> 02:54:02,965
WHERE WE CAN SEE IT'S ALREADY 

5267
02:54:02,965 --> 02:54:03,833
MOVING THROUGH. 

5268
02:54:03,833 --> 02:54:05,868
AND SO, THE ACTUAL RECOVERY 

5269
02:54:05,868 --> 02:54:06,969
EFFORT I THINK WILL BE 

5270
02:54:06,969 --> 02:54:07,536
SIGNIFIANTLY DIFFERENT, I 

5271
02:54:07,536 --> 02:54:07,769
THINK. 

5272
02:54:07,769 --> 02:54:09,071
THAT'S WHY WE ARE POSTURED NOT 

5273
02:54:09,071 --> 02:54:10,172
ONLY WITH THE SEARCH AND RESCUE 

5274
02:54:10,172 --> 02:54:11,274
FROM THE AIR AND HELICOPTERS, 

5275
02:54:11,274 --> 02:54:12,175
BUT ALSO WITH THE GROUND 

5276
02:54:12,175 --> 02:54:14,110
VEHICLES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO 

5277
02:54:14,110 --> 02:54:14,377
COME IN. 

5278
02:54:14,377 --> 02:54:16,045
SO, I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR 

5279
02:54:16,045 --> 02:54:16,813
YOU, PER SE, BUT FROM A 

5280
02:54:16,813 --> 02:54:17,546
CAPACITY STANDPOINT, WE ARE 

5281
02:54:17,546 --> 02:54:18,481
BRINGING IN SIMILAR CAPABILITY 

5282
02:54:18,481 --> 02:54:22,184
CAPACITY THAT WE DID FOR 

5283
02:54:22,184 --> 02:54:24,387
FLORENCE, BUT, WHERE OUR FOCUS 

5284
02:54:24,387 --> 02:54:25,421
IS, BECAUSE OF THE FAST-MOVING 

5285
02:54:25,421 --> 02:54:26,656
NATURE OF THE STORM, WE THINK 

5286
02:54:26,656 --> 02:54:28,491
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO IT BY 

5287
02:54:28,491 --> 02:54:29,058
LAND AS WELL. 

5288
02:54:29,058 --> 02:54:32,862
>> COURTNEY, THEN JEFF. 

5289
02:54:32,862 --> 02:54:34,096
>> FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED THIS. 

5290
02:54:34,096 --> 02:54:35,164
BUT, WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING 

5291
02:54:35,164 --> 02:54:36,365
THROUGH ALL OF THE ASSETS, YOU 

5292
02:54:36,365 --> 02:54:37,566
TALKED ABOUT PJ TEAMS TO THE 

5293
02:54:37,566 --> 02:54:39,035
WEST, AND SOME SWIFT WATER 

5294
02:54:39,035 --> 02:54:41,537
RESCUE BOATS. 

5295
02:54:41,537 --> 02:54:42,104
WHERE ARE THEY STATIONED? 

5296
02:54:42,104 --> 02:54:42,939
>> GULFPORT, MISSISSIPPI IS 

5297
02:54:42,939 --> 02:54:44,040
WHERE WE ARE PUTTING THEM. 

5298
02:54:44,040 --> 02:54:45,374
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE PATRICK 

5299
02:54:45,374 --> 02:54:47,610
AIR FORCE BASE FROM THE EAST 

5300
02:54:47,610 --> 02:54:47,810
SIDE. 

5301
02:54:47,810 --> 02:54:49,078
>> THERE ARE TWO TEAMS AT 

5302
02:54:49,078 --> 02:54:50,112
PATRICK AND MORE AT GULFPORT? 

5303
02:54:50,112 --> 02:54:50,580
>> RIGHT. 

5304
02:54:50,580 --> 02:54:53,983
AND THERE'S MORE FROM THE COAST 

5305
02:54:53,983 --> 02:54:55,150
GUARD STANDPOINT, I WILL USE AN 

5306
02:54:55,150 --> 02:54:56,352
EXAMPLE OF THE GRAY SYSTEM WE 

5307
02:54:56,352 --> 02:54:58,988
HAVE WITHIN THE NATIONAL GUARD, 

5308
02:54:58,988 --> 02:55:00,089
AS THEY FEEL THAT THEY NEED 

5309
02:55:00,089 --> 02:55:01,090
ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY, THEY ARE 

5310
02:55:01,090 --> 02:55:05,695
ABLE TO PUT OUT OTHER STATES, 

5311
02:55:05,695 --> 02:55:06,362
AND FIND ADDITIONAL 

5312
02:55:06,362 --> 02:55:06,695
CAPABILITIES. 

5313
02:55:06,695 --> 02:55:07,730
SO THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE, 15 

5314
02:55:07,730 --> 02:55:08,364
ADDITIONAL HELICOPTERS COMING 

5315
02:55:08,364 --> 02:55:09,932
IN FROM OTHER STATES TO SUPPORT 

5316
02:55:09,932 --> 02:55:14,470
FLORIDA, THAT WILL ALSO BE DOWN 

5317
02:55:14,470 --> 02:55:15,338
IN THE GULFPORT AREA. 

5318
02:55:15,338 --> 02:55:16,572
>> 15 ADDITIONAL NATIONAL GUARD 

5319
02:55:16,572 --> 02:55:16,905
HELICOPTERS. 

5320
02:55:16,905 --> 02:55:17,306
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

5321
02:55:17,306 --> 02:55:20,142
>> AND THEN, -- ACTUALLY, I 

5322
02:55:20,142 --> 02:55:21,010
THINK THAT WAS IT. 

5323
02:55:21,010 --> 02:55:35,524
OH, ONE OTHER THING. 

5324
02:55:35,524 --> 02:55:36,558
HUNTER AND FORT STEWART, THEY 

5325
02:55:36,558 --> 02:55:37,460
WILL HAVE ROTARY AND HIGH 

5326
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:37,693
WATER. 

5327
02:55:37,693 --> 02:55:38,894
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO 

5328
02:55:38,894 --> 02:55:40,463
FIGURE OUT, AND I KNOW I ASKED 

5329
02:55:40,463 --> 02:55:41,364
YOU THIS WITH THE FLORENCE 

5330
02:55:41,364 --> 02:55:42,465
BRIEFING, BUT ONE THING WE ARE 

5331
02:55:42,465 --> 02:55:43,866
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS, WHERE 

5332
02:55:43,866 --> 02:55:44,867
IS THE FIRST THINGS THINGS ARE 

5333
02:55:44,867 --> 02:55:46,068
GOING TO BE COMING FROM? 

5334
02:55:46,068 --> 02:55:47,470
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHERE 

5335
02:55:47,470 --> 02:55:48,437
THE FIRST SEARCH AND RESCUE 

5336
02:55:48,437 --> 02:55:49,038
ASSETS WILL BE? 

5337
02:55:49,038 --> 02:55:50,072
I KNOW THAT'S HARD TO ANSWER. 

5338
02:55:50,072 --> 02:55:53,609
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BUT 

5339
02:55:53,609 --> 02:55:56,078
FRANKLY, THAT'S PART OF THE 

5340
02:55:56,078 --> 02:55:57,179
REASON WHY WE DO THE 

5341
02:55:57,179 --> 02:55:57,612
SURROUNDING PARTS. 

5342
02:55:57,612 --> 02:55:58,781
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING 

5343
02:55:58,781 --> 02:55:59,482
TO PLAY OUT. 

5344
02:55:59,482 --> 02:56:00,583
IN THIS CASE WE THINK JUST 

5345
02:56:00,583 --> 02:56:01,984
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE STORM IS 

5346
02:56:01,984 --> 02:56:03,452
COMING, WE WILL BE ABLE TO COME 

5347
02:56:03,452 --> 02:56:03,986
IN FROM BEHIND. 

5348
02:56:03,986 --> 02:56:04,920
THAT'S WHY THE PATRICK FLOOR 

5349
02:56:04,920 --> 02:56:05,287
SITS THERE. 

5350
02:56:05,287 --> 02:56:06,656
WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO 

5351
02:56:06,656 --> 02:56:07,590
COME IN FROM THE SOUTH. 

5352
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:08,858
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE FEELING 

5353
02:56:08,858 --> 02:56:09,959
CAPABILITY AS WELL SO WE CAN 

5354
02:56:09,959 --> 02:56:10,859
TRAVERSE IN FROM THE GULF 

5355
02:56:10,859 --> 02:56:11,260
ITSELF. 

5356
02:56:11,260 --> 02:56:12,261
CLEARLY AS WE SEE THE TRACK 

5357
02:56:12,261 --> 02:56:13,896
THAT IS BETTER TO FIND IN THIS 

5358
02:56:13,896 --> 02:56:15,064
CASE AND IT WAS IN FLORENCE, WE 

5359
02:56:15,064 --> 02:56:17,033
WILL SEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE 

5360
02:56:17,033 --> 02:56:17,967
TO COME IN FROM THE SOUTH AND 

5361
02:56:17,967 --> 02:56:19,168
THEN ULTIMATELY FROM THE WEST 

5362
02:56:19,168 --> 02:56:19,668
AND EAST ADDITIONALLY. 

5363
02:56:19,668 --> 02:56:20,670
>> NO ASSETS HAVE BEEN 

5364
02:56:20,670 --> 02:56:21,170
REQUESTED YET, RIGHT? 

5365
02:56:21,170 --> 02:56:22,738
EVERYTHING IS STILL BEING 

5366
02:56:22,738 --> 02:56:23,272
POSITIONED? 

5367
02:56:23,272 --> 02:56:24,273
>> FROM THE FEDERAL STANDPOINT, 

5368
02:56:24,273 --> 02:56:25,341
WITH RESPECT TO FEMA, OUR 

5369
02:56:25,341 --> 02:56:26,075
SEARCH AND RESCUE CAPABILITY 

5370
02:56:26,075 --> 02:56:27,543
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW HAS 

5371
02:56:27,543 --> 02:56:28,811
NOT BEEN ACTIVATED TO BE PUT IN 

5372
02:56:28,811 --> 02:56:30,112
USE, YET. 

5373
02:56:30,112 --> 02:56:33,683
>> AT ME JUST ADD ONE THING TO 

5374
02:56:33,683 --> 02:56:33,883
THAT. 

5375
02:56:33,883 --> 02:56:35,184
THAT SAID, I WANT TO BE VERY 

5376
02:56:35,184 --> 02:56:35,450
CLEAR. 

5377
02:56:35,450 --> 02:56:38,220
ALL OF THE STATES, PARTICULARLY 

5378
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:43,759
FLORIDA, THEY HAVE INCREDIBLY 

5379
02:56:43,759 --> 02:56:44,860
ROBUST CAPABILITIES FROM BOTH A 

5380
02:56:44,860 --> 02:56:45,728
VERTICAL LIFT, OR A HELICOPTER 

5381
02:56:45,728 --> 02:56:46,796
SEARCH AND RESCUE, HIGH WATER 

5382
02:56:46,796 --> 02:56:47,529
VEHICLES, AND THE NATIONAL 

5383
02:56:47,529 --> 02:56:48,764
GUARD, I WILL JUST GIVE AN 

5384
02:56:48,764 --> 02:56:49,064
EXAMPLE. 

5385
02:56:49,064 --> 02:56:50,433
WITHIN FLORIDA, THEY HAVE BEEN 

5386
02:56:50,433 --> 02:56:52,868
AUTHORIZED TO 3500 OF THEIR 

5387
02:56:52,868 --> 02:56:53,869
GUARDSMEN ARE AUTHORIZED TO BE 

5388
02:56:53,869 --> 02:56:54,670
ACTIVATED BY THE GOVERNOR. 

5389
02:56:54,670 --> 02:56:56,405
THEY HAVE ABOUT 2300 OF THEM 

5390
02:56:56,405 --> 02:57:01,110
THAT WERE IN POSITION AS THE 

5391
02:57:01,110 --> 02:57:01,577
STORM MADE LANDFALL. 

5392
02:57:01,577 --> 02:57:02,678
SO, THEY HAVE A VERY ROBUST 

5393
02:57:02,678 --> 02:57:03,279
NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE 

5394
02:57:03,279 --> 02:57:04,480
LITERALLY AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW 

5395
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:05,281
THAT IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED. 

5396
02:57:05,281 --> 02:57:06,748
>> JEFF, AND THEN LOUIS. 

5397
02:57:06,748 --> 02:57:08,184
>> GENERAL JEFF. 

5398
02:57:08,184 --> 02:57:10,019
DO YOU HAVE A TOTAL NUMBER OF 

5399
02:57:10,019 --> 02:57:17,359
HOW MANY TITLE 10 PERSONNEL, 

5400
02:57:17,359 --> 02:57:17,993
AIRCRAFT, AND VEHICLES HAVE 

5401
02:57:17,993 --> 02:57:18,460
BEEN PRE-POSITIONED? 

5402
02:57:18,460 --> 02:57:18,861
>> I DO. 

5403
02:57:18,861 --> 02:57:20,262
AS WE SAID RIGHT NOW THIS WILL 

5404
02:57:20,262 --> 02:57:21,730
CHANGE OVER TIME DEPENDING ON 

5405
02:57:21,730 --> 02:57:25,468
DEMAND SIGNALS. 

5406
02:57:25,468 --> 02:57:26,435
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 2600 ACTIVE-

5407
02:57:26,435 --> 02:57:27,370
DUTY PERSONNEL THAT HAVE BEEN 

5408
02:57:27,370 --> 02:57:27,737
PREPOSITIONED. 

5409
02:57:27,737 --> 02:57:28,471
THERE IS 32 ACTIVE HELICOPTERS. 

5410
02:57:28,471 --> 02:57:31,974
THERE ARE 240 ACTIVE-DUTY HIGH 

5411
02:57:31,974 --> 02:57:32,341
WATER VEHICLES. 

5412
02:57:32,341 --> 02:57:40,716
AND, 32 SWIFT WATER BOATS FROM 

5413
02:57:40,716 --> 02:57:41,717
THAT TITLE 10 OR ACTIVE-DUTY 

5414
02:57:41,717 --> 02:57:41,984
SIDE. 

5415
02:57:41,984 --> 02:57:42,985
BUT THAT NUMBER WILL CHANGE, 

5416
02:57:42,985 --> 02:57:43,753
LITERALLY, HOURLY, AS THE 

5417
02:57:43,753 --> 02:57:44,687
DEMAND SIGNAL COMES IN. 

5418
02:57:44,687 --> 02:57:46,188
AS WE SIT RIGHT NOW, THAT'S 

5419
02:57:46,188 --> 02:57:50,760
WHERE IT IS. 

5420
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:51,861
>> FORGIVE A ROOKIE QUESTION, 

5421
02:57:51,861 --> 02:57:53,062
BUT, WHY DOES THERE NEED TO BE 

5422
02:57:53,062 --> 02:57:54,196
A FEDERAL RESPONSE, IF YOU 

5423
02:57:54,196 --> 02:57:55,097
MENTIONED FLORIDA HAS A ROBUST 

5424
02:57:55,097 --> 02:57:56,599
CAPABILITY, AND A LOT OF 

5425
02:57:56,599 --> 02:58:03,839
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN? 

5426
02:58:03,839 --> 02:58:05,441
WHY IS THERE A ROLE FOR THE 

5427
02:58:05,441 --> 02:58:06,275
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HERE AT ALL? 

5428
02:58:06,275 --> 02:58:07,343
>> THANKS FOR ASKING THAT 

5429
02:58:07,343 --> 02:58:07,609
QUESTION. 

5430
02:58:07,609 --> 02:58:08,744
IT'S A PART OF A NATIONAL 

5431
02:58:08,744 --> 02:58:09,177
RESPONSE FRAMEWORK. 

5432
02:58:09,177 --> 02:58:10,413
BY DESIGN, IT STARTS WITH THE 

5433
02:58:10,413 --> 02:58:11,480
LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN THE LOCAL 

5434
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:12,081
LEVEL RESPONSE. 

5435
02:58:12,081 --> 02:58:13,282
AND THEN BASED ON THE MAGNITUDE 

5436
02:58:13,282 --> 02:58:14,216
OF THOSE STORMS ARE SOMETIMES 

5437
02:58:14,216 --> 02:58:14,850
EXCEEDS THEIR CAPABILITY AND 

5438
02:58:14,850 --> 02:58:15,985
CAPACITY, THEREFORE WE HAVE THE 

5439
02:58:15,985 --> 02:58:17,286
FEDERAL SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT IS 

5440
02:58:17,286 --> 02:58:18,387
ABLE TO AUGMENT AND HELP THE 

5441
02:58:18,387 --> 02:58:19,488
STATES WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH 

5442
02:58:19,488 --> 02:58:20,456
THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY ARE 

5443
02:58:20,456 --> 02:58:20,856
FACED WITH. 

5444
02:58:20,856 --> 02:58:21,757
BUT, CLEARLY, THE INTENT IS 

5445
02:58:21,757 --> 02:58:23,159
THAT THE STATES IN THIS CASE, 

5446
02:58:23,159 --> 02:58:23,859
FLORIDA, GEORGIA FOR EXAMPLE, 

5447
02:58:23,859 --> 02:58:25,360
ARE GOING TO HANDLE THE INITIAL 

5448
02:58:25,360 --> 02:58:26,662
RESPOND. 

5449
02:58:26,662 --> 02:58:27,863
AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO 

5450
02:58:27,863 --> 02:58:28,764
AUGMENT IN COORDINATION WITH 

5451
02:58:28,764 --> 02:58:30,099
FEMA, THEIR CAPABILITIES. 

5452
02:58:30,099 --> 02:58:34,937
>> LOUIS, THEN SYLVIE. 

5453
02:58:34,937 --> 02:58:36,338
>> LOUIS MARTINEZ, ABC, SIR. 

5454
02:58:36,338 --> 02:58:46,882
IT HAS THE TAG IN FLORIDA, 

5455
02:58:46,882 --> 02:58:47,683
ACTIVE-DUTY, COMMANDER -- SO 

5456
02:58:47,683 --> 02:58:47,983
FAR? 

5457
02:58:47,983 --> 02:58:49,251
>> YES, THANKS FOR ASKING THAT. 

5458
02:58:49,251 --> 02:58:50,452
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH 

5459
02:58:50,452 --> 02:58:51,754
TANNER MAYBE 30 MINUTES AGO AND 

5460
02:58:51,754 --> 02:58:53,722
HE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED AS A DUAL 

5461
02:58:53,722 --> 02:58:56,392
SATUS COMMANDER WITHIN 

5462
02:58:56,392 --> 02:58:56,658
FLORIDA. 

5463
02:58:56,658 --> 02:58:57,560
THAT GIVES US A MINUTES 

5464
02:58:57,560 --> 02:58:58,594
OPPORTUNITY AS WE BRING OUR 

5465
02:58:58,594 --> 02:58:59,895
TITLE 10 FORCES IN, AND WE PUT 

5466
02:58:59,895 --> 02:59:01,263
THEM UNDER THE GENERAL, HE CAN 

5467
02:59:01,263 --> 02:59:03,265
ACTUALLY ALSO COMMAND THE GUARD 

5468
02:59:03,265 --> 02:59:03,966
FORCES. 

5469
02:59:03,966 --> 02:59:05,000
AND THAT PROMOTES A SYNERGY OF 

5470
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,268
EFFORT THAT WE CAN BE IN LINE 

5471
02:59:06,268 --> 02:59:07,469
WITH, WITH EXACTLY WHAT THE 

5472
02:59:07,469 --> 02:59:08,237
GOVERNOR NEEDS AND WANTS US 

5473
02:59:08,237 --> 02:59:09,238
FOCUSED ON. 

5474
02:59:09,238 --> 02:59:10,639
AND SO, THAT HAS BEEN 

5475
02:59:10,639 --> 02:59:11,040
ACCOMPLISHED. 

5476
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:12,408
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SIGNED 

5477
02:59:12,408 --> 02:59:12,975
THAT YESTERDAY, ACTIVATED 

5478
02:59:12,975 --> 02:59:18,214
TODAY, AND THAT'S IN PLACE. 

5479
02:59:18,214 --> 02:59:19,181
>> HAVE THERE BEEN LESSONS 

5480
02:59:19,181 --> 02:59:20,282
LEARNED FROM FLORENCE JUST A 

5481
02:59:20,282 --> 02:59:20,582
MONTH AGO? 

5482
02:59:20,582 --> 02:59:21,684
BECAUSE, FROM OUR PEOPLE ON THE 

5483
02:59:21,684 --> 02:59:23,085
GROUND, WHEN THEY WERE THERE IN 

5484
02:59:23,085 --> 02:59:23,719
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH THERE, 

5485
02:59:23,719 --> 02:59:24,887
THERE WAS A MISPERCEPTION FROM 

5486
02:59:24,887 --> 02:59:28,557
THE LOCAL POPULATION THAT THE 

5487
02:59:28,557 --> 02:59:29,491
U.S. MILITARY WOULD FLOOD THE 

5488
02:59:29,491 --> 02:59:30,593
ZONES, SO TO SPEAK, VERY 

5489
02:59:30,593 --> 02:59:30,859
QUICKLY. 

5490
02:59:30,859 --> 02:59:35,364
AND YET, THAT WASN'T THE CASE, 

5491
02:59:35,364 --> 02:59:36,665
BECAUSE THE STATE HAD ITS OWN 

5492
02:59:36,665 --> 02:59:38,000
PLAN FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. 

5493
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:39,268
BUT, HOW DO YOU OVERCOME THE 

5494
02:59:39,268 --> 02:59:39,902
PERCEPTION THAT U.S. MILITARY 

5495
02:59:39,902 --> 02:59:50,713
SHOULD MOVE IN QUICKLY? 

5496
02:59:50,713 --> 02:59:52,281
>> I THINK THAT FLORENCE IS A 

5497
02:59:52,281 --> 02:59:52,681
GOOD EXAMPLE. 

5498
02:59:52,681 --> 02:59:54,083
WE DID IN FACT MOVE IN QUICKLY. 

5499
02:59:54,083 --> 02:59:55,050
WE HAD A FAIRLY ROBUST 

5500
02:59:55,050 --> 02:59:55,317
RESPONSE. 

5501
02:59:55,317 --> 02:59:56,518
BUT IN THIS CASE AGAIN, BOTH 

5502
02:59:56,518 --> 02:59:57,686
NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA DID A 

5503
02:59:57,686 --> 02:59:58,621
TREMENDOUS JOB, BOTH WITH THEIR 

5504
02:59:58,621 --> 02:59:59,488
LOCAL FORCES AND NATIONAL GUARD 

5505
02:59:59,488 --> 03:00:05,461
FORCE, UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF 

5506
03:00:05,461 --> 03:00:05,794
THE GOVERNOR. 

5507
03:00:05,794 --> 03:00:06,862
AND AS DESIGNED, THEY ARE THE 

5508
03:00:06,862 --> 03:00:07,262
FIRST RESPONDERS. 

5509
03:00:07,262 --> 03:00:08,564
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO DO THE 

5510
03:00:08,564 --> 03:00:09,732
INITIAL PART AND THEN WE ARE 

5511
03:00:09,732 --> 03:00:10,532
ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. 

5512
03:00:10,532 --> 03:00:11,667
I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A COUPLE 

5513
03:00:11,667 --> 03:00:11,934
EXAMPLES. 

5514
03:00:11,934 --> 03:00:13,269
THE TITLE 10 FORCES HAVE 367 

5515
03:00:13,269 --> 03:00:13,836
SAVES THROUGHOUT FLORENCE. 

5516
03:00:13,836 --> 03:00:15,437
THAT MIGHT NOT BE IN THE 

5517
03:00:15,437 --> 03:00:15,837
BROADER SENSE. 

5518
03:00:15,837 --> 03:00:16,839
BUT, FROM THE OVERALL RESPONSE, 

5519
03:00:16,839 --> 03:00:17,940
THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE MEMBERS 

5520
03:00:17,940 --> 03:00:18,707
THAT WERE ACTUALLY SAVED. 

5521
03:00:18,707 --> 03:00:24,880
I'LL ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK 

5522
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:25,581
THAT THE LOCAL INSTALLATIONS 

5523
03:00:25,581 --> 03:00:26,982
WERE ABLE TO DO TO WORK WITH 

5524
03:00:26,982 --> 03:00:28,184
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, TO BE ABLE 

5525
03:00:28,184 --> 03:00:29,285
TO DO THAT IMMEDIATE RESPONSE, 

5526
03:00:29,285 --> 03:00:30,085
AND HELP THE FIRST RESPONDERS 

5527
03:00:30,085 --> 03:00:32,755
WHEN THEY MOST NEEDED THAT 

5528
03:00:32,755 --> 03:00:32,955
HELP. 

5529
03:00:32,955 --> 03:00:33,789
AND I WILL SAY, HAVING 

5530
03:00:33,789 --> 03:00:34,790
PERSONALLY GONE DOWN THERE AND 

5531
03:00:34,790 --> 03:00:35,658
SEEN THE DEVASTATION AND 

5532
03:00:35,658 --> 03:00:36,759
RESPONSE OF BOTH THE TITLE 10 

5533
03:00:36,759 --> 03:00:38,060
AS GUARD FORCES, I THINK IT 

5534
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:38,861
ACTUALLY WORKED AS IT'S 

5535
03:00:38,861 --> 03:00:39,461
DESIGNED TO DO. 

5536
03:00:39,461 --> 03:00:40,429
AND, QUITE EFFECTIVELY. 

5537
03:00:40,429 --> 03:00:46,101
>> SYLVIE, THEN LUCAS. 

5538
03:00:46,101 --> 03:00:49,672
>> I KNOW YOU CANNOT GIVE A LOT 

5539
03:00:49,672 --> 03:00:55,444
OF DATES ABOUT THE DURATIONS 

5540
03:00:55,444 --> 03:00:56,645
AND THE BASES, BUT, CAN YOU 

5541
03:00:56,645 --> 03:00:59,548
TELL US HOW MANY PLANES, FOR 

5542
03:00:59,548 --> 03:01:02,084
EXAMPLE, YOU HAD TO DISPLACE? 

5543
03:01:02,084 --> 03:01:07,590
OR, TELL US IF IT WAS SOMETHING

5544
03:01:07,590 --> 03:01:10,192
, NOT HABITUAL, NOT USUAL FOR 

5545
03:01:10,192 --> 03:01:12,294
YOU? 

5546
03:01:12,294 --> 03:01:13,495
>> AGAIN, SPECIFICALLY, TO THE 

5547
03:01:13,495 --> 03:01:19,068
INDIVIDUAL INSTALLATIONS AND 

5548
03:01:19,068 --> 03:01:19,868
THEIR RESPONSE TO IT, THAT'S 

5549
03:01:19,868 --> 03:01:20,469
UNDER THE INDIVIDUAL 

5550
03:01:20,469 --> 03:01:21,503
AUTHORITIES OF THE INSULATION 

5551
03:01:21,503 --> 03:01:36,452
COMMANDER AND SERVICES. 

5552
03:01:36,452 --> 03:01:37,753
WHAT WE ARE TIED TO IS BOTH, 

5553
03:01:37,753 --> 03:01:38,954
WHAT CAPABILITY DO WE NEED TO 

5554
03:01:38,954 --> 03:01:40,322
HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THE STATES 

5555
03:01:40,322 --> 03:01:41,156
AND AS FAR AS A NATIONAL 

5556
03:01:41,156 --> 03:01:42,191
RESPONSE AND, WHAT IS THE 

5557
03:01:42,191 --> 03:01:43,258
CAPABILITY WE NEED TO HAVE FOR 

5558
03:01:43,258 --> 03:01:44,393
ONGOING OPERATIONS AND HOW DO 

5559
03:01:44,393 --> 03:01:45,260
WE TRANSITION THAT TO A 

5560
03:01:45,260 --> 03:01:46,261
DIFFERENT LOCATION IF WE NEED 

5561
03:01:46,261 --> 03:01:47,095
TO FOR THE INSULATION? 

5562
03:01:47,095 --> 03:01:47,963
SPECIFICALLY TO HOW MANY 

5563
03:01:47,963 --> 03:01:48,864
AIRPLANES HAVE LEFT AND 

5564
03:01:48,864 --> 03:01:49,865

5565
03:01:49,865 --> 03:01:50,566

5566

LIKE THAT SINCE THEN? 

5573
03:01:56,538 --> 03:01:57,473

5574
03:01:57,473 --> 03:01:58,841
FACT THAT IT REALLY HIT US AT

ANALYSTS SAY INVESTORS ARE 

5617
03:05:06,695 --> 03:05:07,462
WORRIED ABOUT RISING INTEREST 

5618
03:05:07,462 --> 03:05:07,695
RATES. 

5619
03:05:07,695 --> 03:05:09,064
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE DOW 

5620
03:05:09,064 --> 03:05:10,065

5621

SCOTT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING

03:05:21,910 --> 03:05:22,244
WITH US. 

5628
03:05:22,244 --> 03:05:23,278
WHAT EXACTLY IS DRIVING THIS 

5629
03:05:23,278 --> 03:05:23,745
SELL OFF. 

5630
03:05:23,745 --> 03:05:24,713
TO CHINA TARIFFS HAVE SOMETHING 

5631
03:05:24,713 --> 03:05:26,682
TO DO WITH IT? 

5632
03:05:26,682 --> 03:05:27,049
>> NO. 

5633
03:05:27,049 --> 03:05:28,083
I WOULD SAY THE INTEREST RATE 

5634
03:05:28,083 --> 03:05:29,084
WORRIES YOU MENTIONED ARE THE 

5635
03:05:29,084 --> 03:05:29,484
MAIN CULPRIT. 

5636
03:05:29,484 --> 03:05:30,652
YOU KNOW, INTEREST RATES HAVE 

5637
03:05:30,652 --> 03:05:32,421
BEEN A FEAR FOR MOST OF THE 

5638
03:05:32,421 --> 03:05:36,858
YEAR, AND, INVESTORS HAVE BEEN 

5639
03:05:36,858 --> 03:05:38,093
EXPECTING YIELDS IN THE 10-YEAR 

5640
03:05:38,093 --> 03:05:45,467
TREASURY TO RISE, JUST AS THE 

5641
03:05:45,467 --> 03:05:46,101
FEDERAL RESERVE HIKES INTEREST 

5642
03:05:46,101 --> 03:05:46,334
RATES. 

5643
03:05:46,334 --> 03:05:47,569
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE HIKED RATES 

5644
03:05:47,569 --> 03:05:48,804
THREE TIMES THIS YEAR AND ARE 

5645
03:05:48,804 --> 03:05:50,172
GEARING UP FOR A FOURTH ONE IN 

5646
03:05:50,172 --> 03:05:50,439
DECEMBER. 

5647
03:05:50,439 --> 03:05:51,140
ALTHOUGH, WITH THE MARKET 

5648
03:05:51,140 --> 03:05:52,241
VOLATILITY THAT WE ARE SEEING 

5649
03:05:52,241 --> 03:05:53,442
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE GOING TO 

5650
03:05:53,442 --> 03:05:54,709
HAVE INVESTORS START TO WONDER 

5651
03:05:54,709 --> 03:05:56,878
IF FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL 

5652
03:05:56,878 --> 03:05:58,113
WILL GO AHEAD WITH THAT 

5653
03:05:58,113 --> 03:05:59,615
DECEMBER HIKE. 

5654
03:05:59,615 --> 03:06:11,460
OBVIOUSLY, TIME WILL TELL. 

5655
03:06:11,460 --> 03:06:12,460
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MONTHS 

5656
03:06:12,460 --> 03:06:13,061
UNTIL THAT POINT. 

5657
03:06:13,061 --> 03:06:14,095
>> SCOTT, YOU FOLLOW THE 

5658
03:06:14,095 --> 03:06:14,362
MARKETS. 

5659
03:06:14,362 --> 03:06:15,497
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. 

5660
03:06:15,497 --> 03:06:16,298
HOW MUCH DID THIS SELLOFF 

5661
03:06:16,298 --> 03:06:16,732
SURPRISE YOU? 

5662
03:06:16,732 --> 03:06:17,766
IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. 

5663
03:06:17,766 --> 03:06:19,067
USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE A SELLOFF 

5664
03:06:19,067 --> 03:06:20,369
LIKE THIS THERE TENDS TO BE A 

5665
03:06:20,369 --> 03:06:21,637
LITTLE BIT OF ABOUNDS AT THE 

5666
03:06:21,637 --> 03:06:22,337
END OF THE DAY. 

5667
03:06:22,337 --> 03:06:23,639
BUYERS COMING IN FOR THE DEALS. 

5668
03:06:23,639 --> 03:06:24,840
WE DID NOT SEE THAT TODAY. 

5669
03:06:24,840 --> 03:06:25,807
>> HERE AT YAHOO FINANCE, WE'VE 

5670
03:06:25,807 --> 03:06:26,642
BEEN COVERING THE MARKET 

5671
03:06:26,642 --> 03:06:27,276
SELLOFF ALL DAY. 

5672
03:06:27,276 --> 03:06:28,776
AND, THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT 

5673
03:06:28,776 --> 03:06:29,678
POINT. 

5674
03:06:29,678 --> 03:06:31,046
WE DID NOT SEE ANY BUYERS COME 

5675
03:06:31,046 --> 03:06:32,548
IN AT THE END OF THE DAY, WAS 

5676
03:06:32,548 --> 03:06:33,682
SORT OF THIS PANIC SELLING, SO 

5677
03:06:33,682 --> 03:06:34,082
TO SPEAK. 

5678
03:06:34,082 --> 03:06:35,284
THE DOW WAS DOWN 500 POINTS. 

5679
03:06:35,284 --> 03:06:36,185
IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON. 

5680
03:06:36,185 --> 03:06:37,819
AND, AS THAT, YOU KNOW, 3:30 

5681
03:06:37,819 --> 03:06:40,756
LEVEL APPROACHED, 3:30 P.M., 

5682
03:06:40,756 --> 03:06:41,690
INTO THE 4 P.M. 

5683
03:06:41,690 --> 03:06:42,858
CLOSE, THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW SOME 

5684
03:06:42,858 --> 03:06:44,459
OF THE BIGGEST DECLINES IN THE 

5685
03:06:44,459 --> 03:06:47,863
DOW TODAY. 

5686
03:06:47,863 --> 03:06:48,764
LEADING 831 POINTS DECLINE. 

5687
03:06:48,764 --> 03:06:53,769
WHAT IS INTERESTING, THOUGH, 

5688
03:06:53,769 --> 03:06:54,770
IS, YIELDS ON THE 10 YEAR 

5689
03:06:54,770 --> 03:06:55,537
TREASURY YIELDS WE MENTIONED 

5690
03:06:55,537 --> 03:06:57,839
EARLIER, HOW THEY HAVE BEEN 

5691
03:06:57,839 --> 03:06:59,207
RISING, THE ACTUALLY FELL AT 

5692
03:06:59,207 --> 03:07:00,876
THE VERY END OF THE SESSION, 

5693
03:07:00,876 --> 03:07:04,479
MEANING THAT INVESTORS TOOK 

5694
03:07:04,479 --> 03:07:05,847
MONEY OUT OF STOCKS, AS YOU 

5695
03:07:05,847 --> 03:07:06,047
KNOW. 

5696
03:07:06,047 --> 03:07:07,049
BUT, ACTUALLY PUT THEM INTO 

5697
03:07:07,049 --> 03:07:15,757
BONDS AS A SAFE HAVEN PLACE. 

5698
03:07:15,757 --> 03:07:16,725
ANYTIME WE SEE TREASURY YIELDS 

5699
03:07:16,725 --> 03:07:17,859
FALL, IT MEANS INVESTORS HAVE 

5700
03:07:17,859 --> 03:07:18,760
BEEN BUYING BONDS, PRICES, AND 

5701
03:07:18,760 --> 03:07:19,561
YIELDS MOVE IN OPPOSITE 

5702
03:07:19,561 --> 03:07:19,861
DIRECTIONS. 

5703
03:07:19,861 --> 03:07:20,963
>> SO NOBODY IS SITTING ON 

5704
03:07:20,963 --> 03:07:22,097
THEIR CASH OR PUTTING IT INTO 

5705
03:07:22,097 --> 03:07:27,169
GOLD JUST YET? 

5706
03:07:27,169 --> 03:07:27,669
>> YEAH. 

5707
03:07:27,669 --> 03:07:28,870
I THINK THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF 

5708
03:07:28,870 --> 03:07:29,838
INVESTORS KIND OF SITTING ON 

5709
03:07:29,838 --> 03:07:31,039
THEIR HANDS, GOING INTO CASH. 

5710
03:07:31,039 --> 03:07:31,807
BUT YOU KNOW, LOOK. 

5711
03:07:31,807 --> 03:07:32,741
IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT 

5712
03:07:32,741 --> 03:07:34,242
THAT THE S&P 500 IS STILL UP 4% 

5713
03:07:34,242 --> 03:07:34,876
FOR THE YEAR. 

5714
03:07:34,876 --> 03:07:36,111
YOU KNOW, AND WE COULD VERY 

5715
03:07:36,111 --> 03:07:40,849
WELL END UP WELL BEYOND THAT 

5716
03:07:40,849 --> 03:07:41,850
LEVEL TOWARDS THE END OF THE 

5717
03:07:41,850 --> 03:07:42,083
YEAR. 

5718
03:07:42,083 --> 03:07:43,452
A LOT OF STRATEGISTS STILL HAVE 

5719
03:07:43,452 --> 03:07:45,553
A 3000 TARGET ON THE S&P 500. 

5720
03:07:45,553 --> 03:07:46,554
WE ARE NOW AT 27,085. 

5721
03:07:46,554 --> 03:07:49,958
THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS 

5722
03:07:49,958 --> 03:07:51,359
THAT, OCTOBER IS TYPICALLY A 

5723
03:07:51,359 --> 03:07:52,294
VOLATILE MONTH FOR THE MARKET. 

5724
03:07:52,294 --> 03:07:54,763
AS YOU GO BACK HISTORICALLY. 

5725
03:07:54,763 --> 03:07:55,496
WE'VE HAD MANY CORRECTIONS 

5726
03:07:55,496 --> 03:07:56,365
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, DURING 

5727
03:07:56,365 --> 03:08:03,472
THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. 

5728
03:08:03,472 --> 03:08:04,740
>> SO, SCOTT, HOW CONCERNED DO 

5729
03:08:04,740 --> 03:08:05,674
YOU THINK INVESTORS SHOULD BE? 

5730
03:08:05,674 --> 03:08:07,175
OR SHOULD THEY WAKE UP TOMORROW 

5731
03:08:07,175 --> 03:08:08,509
MORNING AND START BUYING UP THE 

5732
03:08:08,509 --> 03:08:10,211
DEALS? 

5733
03:08:10,211 --> 03:08:11,480
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 

5734
03:08:11,480 --> 03:08:12,781
TO LOOK AT HOW SOME OF THE 

5735
03:08:12,781 --> 03:08:13,748
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS PERFORM 

5736
03:08:13,748 --> 03:08:16,251
OVERNIGHT. 

5737
03:08:16,251 --> 03:08:17,486
AND, WE WILL KIND OF REASSESS 

5738
03:08:17,486 --> 03:08:18,286
IN THE MORNING, SEE WHERE 

5739
03:08:18,286 --> 03:08:19,754
FUTURES ARE, SEE WHERE EUROPE 

5740
03:08:19,754 --> 03:08:21,289
IS, SEE WHERE ASIA IS. 

5741
03:08:21,289 --> 03:08:23,759
BUT, I WOULD EXPECT SOME 

5742
03:08:23,759 --> 03:08:28,063
ADDITIONAL VOLATILITY, INTO 

5743
03:08:28,063 --> 03:08:29,064
TOMORROW, JUST GIVEN HOW WE 

5744
03:08:29,064 --> 03:08:30,465
DIDN'T SEE ANY BUYERS COME IN 

5745
03:08:30,465 --> 03:08:32,067
AT THE END OF THE TRADING 

5746
03:08:32,067 --> 03:08:35,437
SESSION TODAY. 

5747
03:08:35,437 --> 03:08:36,571
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING TO 

5748
03:08:36,571 --> 03:08:37,539
POINT OUT, IS THAT, INVESTORS 

5749
03:08:37,539 --> 03:08:38,907
ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO REMAIN 

5750
03:08:38,907 --> 03:08:41,709
DIVERSIFIED. 

5751
03:08:41,709 --> 03:08:43,011
SO, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON 

5752
03:08:43,011 --> 03:08:43,845
WITH INTEREST RATES. 

5753
03:08:43,845 --> 03:08:44,880
AND, YOU HAVE TO WONDER, WHAT 

5754
03:08:44,880 --> 03:08:46,515
DO INTEREST RATES HAVE TO DO 

5755
03:08:46,515 --> 03:08:49,384
WITH EARNINGS PRICE OF 

5756
03:08:49,384 --> 03:08:50,285
MULTIPLE, OF SAY, PFIZER, OR 

5757
03:08:50,285 --> 03:08:52,954
PROCTOR AND GAMBLE? 

5758
03:08:52,954 --> 03:08:53,889
OR, STOCKS THAT COMPANIES WILL 

5759
03:08:53,889 --> 03:08:56,558
DO WELL, REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS 

5760
03:08:56,558 --> 03:08:59,661
GOING ON IN THE MARKET ECONOMY? 

5761
03:08:59,661 --> 03:09:01,430
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE BUYING 

5762
03:09:01,430 --> 03:09:08,437
TOOTHPASTE, BUYING MEDICINE. 

5763
03:09:08,437 --> 03:09:09,638
I THINK WE WILL START TO SEE 

5764
03:09:09,638 --> 03:09:10,739
SOME OF THOSE DEFENSIVE PLAYS 

5765
03:09:10,739 --> 03:09:11,673
IN THE MARKETS CREEP UP. 

5766
03:09:11,673 --> 03:09:12,941
>> OKAY, SCOTT, THANK YOU SO 

5767
03:09:12,941 --> 03:09:13,775
MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHT. 

5768
03:09:13,775 --> 03:09:14,910
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, TANYA. 

5769
03:09:14,910 --> 03:09:16,044
>> LET'S TURN BACK NOW TO 

5770
03:09:16,044 --> 03:09:16,678
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

5771
03:09:16,678 --> 03:09:17,679
CBS NEWS CAN SHOOTING MARRIOTT 

5772
03:09:17,679 --> 03:09:21,783
-- METEOROLOGIST JEFF BARICELLI 

5773
03:09:21,783 --> 03:09:22,049
IS HERE. 

5774
03:09:22,049 --> 03:09:22,850
WE ARE TALKING EARLY. 

5775
03:09:22,850 --> 03:09:24,552
YOU HAVE FAMILY DOWN IN PANAMA 

5776
03:09:24,552 --> 03:09:29,090
CITY. 

5777
03:09:29,090 --> 03:09:30,125
YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH THEM. 

5778
03:09:30,125 --> 03:09:31,259
WHAT HAVE THEY TOLD YOU ABOUT 

5779
03:09:31,259 --> 03:09:31,692
CONDITIONS THERE? 

5780
03:09:31,692 --> 03:09:33,061
>> I WAS TALKING WITH MY 

5781
03:09:33,061 --> 03:09:33,294
COUSIN. 

5782
03:09:33,294 --> 03:09:38,467
HER IN-LAWS ARE IN PANAMA CITY, 

5783
03:09:38,467 --> 03:09:39,701
BUT ABOUT 20 MILES INLAND AT A 

5784
03:09:39,701 --> 03:09:40,369
SHELTER, A SCHOOL. 

5785
03:09:40,369 --> 03:09:41,670
THE ROOF HAS BLOWN OFF AND THE 

5786
03:09:41,670 --> 03:09:42,637
RAIN IS FLOODING AND TARGET 

5787
03:09:42,637 --> 03:09:44,139
GOES TO SHOW YOU EVEN SOME OF 

5788
03:09:44,139 --> 03:09:45,240
THE BETTER MADE STRUCTURES ARE 

5789
03:09:45,240 --> 03:09:46,074
FAILING AS THIS STORM MOVES 

5790
03:09:46,074 --> 03:09:46,341
OFFSHORE. 

5791
03:09:46,341 --> 03:09:54,449
>> SHOULDN'T WE ASSURE THAT A 

5792
03:09:54,449 --> 03:09:55,450
SCHOOL IS BUILT TO CATEGORY 

5793
03:09:55,450 --> 03:09:55,850
THREE STANDARDS? 

5794
03:09:55,850 --> 03:09:56,885
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS 

5795
03:09:56,885 --> 03:09:57,486
PARTICULAR SCHOOL. 

5796
03:09:57,486 --> 03:09:58,086
WE TALKED ABOUT IT. 

5797
03:09:58,086 --> 03:09:59,087
AFTER 1992, FLORIDA STARTED TO 

5798
03:09:59,087 --> 03:10:02,190
MAKE THE BUILDING CODES MORE 

5799
03:10:02,190 --> 03:10:04,493
STRINGENT. 

5800
03:10:04,493 --> 03:10:05,660
IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER 2001 

5801
03:10:05,660 --> 03:10:06,495
WHERE THEY MADE IT MANDATORY 

5802
03:10:06,495 --> 03:10:07,863
FOR STRUCTURES TO BE ABLE TO 

5803
03:10:07,863 --> 03:10:08,463
WITHSTAND CATEGORY THREE. 

5804
03:10:08,463 --> 03:10:09,197
EVEN STRUCTURES THAT CAN 

5805
03:10:09,197 --> 03:10:09,865
WITHSTAND CATEGORY THREE MAY 

5806
03:10:09,865 --> 03:10:10,966
NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND 

5807
03:10:10,966 --> 03:10:12,467
CATEGORY FOUR OR CATEGORY FIVE. 

5808
03:10:12,467 --> 03:10:13,668
>> HOW FAR INLAND WAS THIS 

5809
03:10:13,668 --> 03:10:13,935
SHELTER? 

5810
03:10:13,935 --> 03:10:14,703
>> ABOUT 25 MILES INLAND. 

5811
03:10:14,703 --> 03:10:15,837
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. 

5812
03:10:15,837 --> 03:10:16,838
IF PEOPLE WERE TAKING SHELTER 

5813
03:10:16,838 --> 03:10:18,072
THERE, IT DID NOT TURN OUT TO 

5814
03:10:18,072 --> 03:10:18,940
BE A GREAT SHELTER. 

5815
03:10:18,940 --> 03:10:20,475
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW DEVASTATING 

5816
03:10:20,475 --> 03:10:23,711
THE SITUATION IS. 

5817
03:10:23,711 --> 03:10:24,946
>> I HOPE THEY ARE OKAY. 

5818
03:10:24,946 --> 03:10:25,847
WHERE DID THEY GO? 

5819
03:10:25,847 --> 03:10:26,681
>> I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE FINE. 

5820
03:10:26,681 --> 03:10:33,054
MY FAMILY HAS TALKED TO THEM. 

5821
03:10:33,054 --> 03:10:34,089
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO I'M SURE 

5822
03:10:34,089 --> 03:10:35,223
STAYED IN MOBILE HOMES, STAYED 

5823
03:10:35,223 --> 03:10:36,525
IN STRUCTURES THAT WERE BUILT 

5824
03:10:36,525 --> 03:10:37,292
BEFORE 19, YOU KNOW, 1992, OR 

5825
03:10:37,292 --> 03:10:39,060
2002, WHEN THE LAW WENT INTO 

5826
03:10:39,060 --> 03:10:41,863
EFFECT. 

5827
03:10:41,863 --> 03:10:48,470
AND, HOPEFULLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE 

5828
03:10:48,470 --> 03:10:48,670
SAFE. 

5829
03:10:48,670 --> 03:10:49,938
>> JEFF, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 

5830
03:10:49,938 --> 03:10:50,438
ABOUT THE STORM? 

5831
03:10:50,438 --> 03:10:52,174
HAS IT REDUCED ITS INTENSITY AT 

5832
03:10:52,174 --> 03:10:52,440
ALL YET? 

5833
03:10:52,440 --> 03:10:53,742
>> WINDS ARE DOWN TO 140 MILES 

5834
03:10:53,742 --> 03:10:54,075
AN HOUR. 

5835
03:10:54,075 --> 03:10:54,909
IT'S CROSSING OVER I-10. 

5836
03:10:54,909 --> 03:10:55,943
NEXT STOP WILL BE THE FLORIDA-

5837
03:10:55,943 --> 03:10:56,444
GEORGIA LINE. 

5838
03:10:56,444 --> 03:10:57,245
BECAUSE IT WAS STRENGTHENING 

5839
03:10:57,245 --> 03:11:01,283
WHEN IT MADE LANDFALL, IT MEANS 

5840
03:11:01,283 --> 03:11:02,651
IT'S GOING TO WE CAN LESS 

5841
03:11:02,651 --> 03:11:02,918
RAPIDLY. 

5842
03:11:02,918 --> 03:11:04,052
THAT MEANS IT'S GOING TO CARRY 

5843
03:11:04,052 --> 03:11:04,753
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS AND 

5844
03:11:04,753 --> 03:11:05,953
DAMAGING WINDS STRAIGHT THROUGH 

5845
03:11:05,953 --> 03:11:07,556
GEORGIA. 

5846
03:11:07,556 --> 03:11:08,890
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SWATH OF 

5847
03:11:08,890 --> 03:11:09,758
DAMAGE, CATEGORY TWO, MAYBE 

5848
03:11:09,758 --> 03:11:10,859
CATEGORY THREE TYPE DAMAGE AND 

5849
03:11:10,859 --> 03:11:14,095
PARTS OF SOUTHERN GEORGIA. 

5850
03:11:14,095 --> 03:11:15,263
>> THAT HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS 

5851
03:11:15,263 --> 03:11:15,664
BEFORE? 

5852
03:11:15,664 --> 03:11:17,065
>> IT'S RARE THAT A STORM WILL 

5853
03:11:17,065 --> 03:11:17,866
BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS 

5854
03:11:17,866 --> 03:11:18,133
ITENSITY. 

5855
03:11:18,133 --> 03:11:19,501
WE SAW IT WITH CHARLIE, WE SAW 

5856
03:11:19,501 --> 03:11:20,936
IT WITH THIS STORM, AND THE 

5857
03:11:20,936 --> 03:11:23,738
COMMON DENOMINATOR IS, THERE 

5858
03:11:23,738 --> 03:11:24,739
WERE STRENGTHE

5859
03:11:24,739 --> 03:11:25,707
FIT THEY HAVE TO PLATEAU, 

5860
03:11:25,707 --> 03:11:29,344
THEN THEY CAN BEGIN TO WEAKEN. 

5861
03:11:29,344 --> 03:11:30,579
THE STORM IS GOING FURTHER IN 

5862
03:11:30,579 --> 03:11:31,279
WITH STRONGER WINDS. 

5863
03:11:31,279 --> 03:11:31,947
>> WHAT ABOUT RAINFALL? 

5864
03:11:31,947 --> 03:11:47,262
DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATES ON THAT? 

5865
03:11:47,262 --> 03:11:48,663
>> WELL, THE RAINFALL AT MAX IS 

5866
03:11:48,663 --> 03:11:49,965
GOING TO BE ABOUT A FOOT, GIVE 

5867
03:11:49,965 --> 03:11:51,066
OR TAKE, MORE THAN THAT. 

5868
03:11:51,066 --> 03:11:51,866
THAT'S OKAY IN NORTH FLORIDA, 

5869
03:11:51,866 --> 03:11:53,168
BUT IT'S GOING TO CAUSE FLASH 

5870
03:11:53,168 --> 03:11:53,768
FLOODING IN GEORGIA. 

5871
03:11:53,768 --> 03:11:55,036
AND THEN, ONCE IT GETS INTO 

5872
03:11:55,036 --> 03:11:55,904
PLACES LIKE SOUTH AND NORTH 

5873
03:11:55,904 --> 03:11:56,838
CAROLINA, WHERE WE STILL HAVE 

5874
03:11:56,838 --> 03:11:57,706
SATURATED GROUND AND SWOLLEN 

5875
03:11:57,706 --> 03:11:58,906
RIVERS, WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE 

5876
03:11:58,906 --> 03:11:59,741
ANOTHER ROUND OF SUBSTANTIAL 

5877
03:11:59,741 --> 03:12:00,275
FLOODING THERE. 

5878
03:12:00,275 --> 03:12:01,042
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN STARTING 

5879
03:12:01,042 --> 03:12:01,510
LATER TONIGHT. 

5880
03:12:01,510 --> 03:12:02,677
THE RAIN HAS STARTED AT TIMES, 

5881
03:12:02,677 --> 03:12:04,045
BUT THE HEAVIEST RAIN, 

5882
03:12:04,045 --> 03:12:04,679
ESPECIALLY TOMORROW, TOMORROW, 

5883
03:12:04,679 --> 03:12:05,547
AS THAT TROPICAL STORM MOVES 

5884
03:12:05,547 --> 03:12:06,114
ACROSS THE CAROLINAS. 

5885
03:12:06,114 --> 03:12:06,848
ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF 

5886
03:12:06,848 --> 03:12:07,849
ISOLATED TORNADOES AS WELL. 

5887
03:12:07,849 --> 03:12:10,085
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

5888
03:12:10,085 --> 03:12:19,060
THAT. 

5889
03:12:19,060 --> 03:12:20,362
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN REGARDS 

5890
03:12:20,362 --> 03:12:21,062
TO THAT RIGHT NOW? 

5891
03:12:21,062 --> 03:12:21,462
ANY INDICATION? 

5892
03:12:21,462 --> 03:12:22,230
>> SURE. 

5893
03:12:22,230 --> 03:12:22,830
EVERY LANDFALLING TROPICAL 

5894
03:12:22,830 --> 03:12:23,431
SYSTEM PRODUCES ONE TORNADO. 

5895
03:12:23,431 --> 03:12:24,299
SOME PRODUCE A LOT, SOME 

5896
03:12:24,299 --> 03:12:25,233
PRODUCE LESS. 

5897
03:12:25,233 --> 03:12:26,201
NO TELLING IF THIS WILL BE A 

5898
03:12:26,201 --> 03:12:29,137
LOT OR A LITTLE BUT, EITHER WAY,

5899
03:12:29,137 --> 03:12:30,338
THERE WILL BE FAST-MOVING RAIN 

5900
03:12:30,338 --> 03:12:30,771
WRAPPED TORNADOES. 

5901
03:12:30,771 --> 03:12:32,040
YOU CAN SEE THEM AND IT'S HARD 

5902
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:32,841
TO PREPARE FOR THEM. 

5903
03:12:32,841 --> 03:12:33,842
WHEN WE SEE THESE AS 

5904
03:12:33,842 --> 03:12:34,476
METEOROLOGIST, THEY'RE MOVING 

5905
03:12:34,476 --> 03:12:45,487
60, 70, 80 MILES AN HOUR. 

5906
03:12:45,487 --> 03:12:46,855
WE SEE THEM AND MIGHT BE ABLE 

5907
03:12:46,855 --> 03:12:48,456
TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF MINUTES 

5908
03:12:48,456 --> 03:12:48,756
LEAD TIME. 

5909
03:12:48,756 --> 03:12:49,858
EITHER WAY, YOU MIGHT NOT BE 

5910
03:12:49,858 --> 03:12:51,259
ABLE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY 

5911
03:12:51,259 --> 03:12:51,960
ARE WRAPPED IN RAIN. 

5912
03:12:51,960 --> 03:12:52,961
IT'S JUST A DIFFICULT SITUATION 

5913
03:12:52,961 --> 03:12:54,095
BUT AGAIN, THE SYSTEM IS GOING 

5914
03:12:54,095 --> 03:12:54,996
TO BE WEAKENING TONIGHT. 

5915
03:12:54,996 --> 03:12:56,164
I THINK BY TOMORROW MORNING, IT 

5916
03:12:56,164 --> 03:12:57,699
SHOULD BE AROUND TROPICAL STORM 

5917
03:12:57,699 --> 03:12:57,932
STATUS. 

5918
03:12:57,932 --> 03:13:00,669
>> WHAT'S THE BIGGEST DANGER 

5919
03:13:00,669 --> 03:13:01,269
FOR FOLKS THERE OVERNIGHT? 

5920
03:13:01,269 --> 03:13:02,637
>> IT'S GOING TO BE WIND 

5921
03:13:02,637 --> 03:13:02,870
DAMAGE. 

5922
03:13:02,870 --> 03:13:03,638
UNDOUBTABLY, IT'S GOING TO BE 

5923
03:13:03,638 --> 03:13:04,839
WIND DAMAGE AND THEN A CONCERN 

5924
03:13:04,839 --> 03:13:05,940
WILL TURN TO FRESHWATER 

5925
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:06,708
FLOODING AND RAIN DAMAGE 

5926
03:13:06,708 --> 03:13:07,308
STARTING TOMORROW AND INTO 

5927
03:13:07,308 --> 03:13:07,809
FRIDAY MORNING. 

5928
03:13:07,809 --> 03:13:08,810
THE STORM WILL BE MOVING 

5929
03:13:08,810 --> 03:13:09,077
OFFSHORE. 

5930
03:13:09,077 --> 03:13:09,711
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 

5931
03:13:09,711 --> 03:13:10,879
NOT MOVING AT THE PACE THAT 

5932
03:13:10,879 --> 03:13:11,246
FLORENCE DID. 

5933
03:13:11,246 --> 03:13:16,217
MOVING MUCH, MUCH SLOWER. 

5934
03:13:16,217 --> 03:13:17,485
ONE OTHER THING TO MENTION IS 

5935
03:13:17,485 --> 03:13:18,653
THAT THIS IS NOT HAPPENING IN 

5936
03:13:18,653 --> 03:13:18,886
AUGUST. 

5937
03:13:18,886 --> 03:13:19,754
PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT POWER 

5938
03:13:19,754 --> 03:13:20,956
FOR THREE WEEKS OR SO IN 

5939
03:13:20,956 --> 03:13:21,356
CERTAIN AREAS. 

5940
03:13:21,356 --> 03:13:22,557
THE GOOD NEWS IS, MAYBE THEY 

5941
03:13:22,557 --> 03:13:23,358
WON'T NEED THEIR AIR 

5942
03:13:23,358 --> 03:13:24,259
CONDITIONING QUITE AS MUCH AS 

5943
03:13:24,259 --> 03:13:32,734
THEY WOULD IN AUGUST. 

5944
03:13:32,734 --> 03:13:33,868
THIS WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE 

5945
03:13:33,868 --> 03:13:34,869
PEOPLE WHO RELY ON AIR 

5946
03:13:34,869 --> 03:13:35,469
CONDITIONING AND ELECTRICITY 

5947
03:13:35,469 --> 03:13:37,338
BUT STILL, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 

5948
03:13:37,338 --> 03:13:37,772
EASY BY ANY MEANS. 

5949
03:13:37,772 --> 03:13:38,740
>> THAT'S HELPFUL FOR THE 

5950
03:13:38,740 --> 03:13:39,240
ELDERLY, CORRECT? 

5951
03:13:39,240 --> 03:13:40,241
SO MANY PARISH WHEN THEY HAVE 

5952
03:13:40,241 --> 03:13:41,242
NO AIR CONDITIONING IN MID-

5953
03:13:41,242 --> 03:13:41,475
AUGUST. 

5954
03:13:41,475 --> 03:13:42,544
>> WE SAW WITH HURRICANE MARIA, 

5955
03:13:42,544 --> 03:13:43,878
IT WASN'T SO MUCH THE DAY OF 

5956
03:13:43,878 --> 03:13:44,980
THE STORM THE PEOPLE DIED. 

5957
03:13:44,980 --> 03:13:46,214
IT WAS THE AFTERMATH AND PEOPLE 

5958
03:13:46,214 --> 03:13:47,248
NOT HAVING THE ELECTRICITY OR 

5959
03:13:47,248 --> 03:13:48,149
ESSENTIALS TO GET THEM THROUGH 

5960
03:13:48,149 --> 03:13:49,751
AND SO WE SAW A LOT OF DEATHS 

5961
03:13:49,751 --> 03:13:50,852
AFTER THE DAY THAT MARIA HIT. 

5962
03:13:50,852 --> 03:13:52,454
>> WE GOT AN UPDATE THAT MORE 

5963
03:13:52,454 --> 03:13:53,555
THAN 257,000 PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT 

5964
03:13:53,555 --> 03:13:53,788
POWER. 

5965
03:13:53,788 --> 03:13:54,355
CERTAINLY, THAT NUMBER IS 

5966
03:13:54,355 --> 03:13:59,294
EXPECTED TO GO UP. 

5967
03:13:59,294 --> 03:13:59,894
YOU MENTIONED THE FRESHWATER 

5968
03:13:59,894 --> 03:14:00,762
SURGE THAT WILL HAPPEN. 

5969
03:14:00,762 --> 03:14:02,063
IS THAT MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE 

5970
03:14:02,063 --> 03:14:02,664
OCEAN SURGE THAT WILL 

5971
03:14:02,664 --> 03:14:03,665
EVENTUALLY GO BACK OUT? 

5972
03:14:03,665 --> 03:14:06,100
>> WELL YOU KNOW, THEY ARE BOTH 

5973
03:14:06,100 --> 03:14:06,701
SOMEWHAT EQUALLY DANGEROUS. 

5974
03:14:06,701 --> 03:14:07,969
YES, THE SURGE WILL GO OUT. 

5975
03:14:07,969 --> 03:14:09,104
THERE IS STILL ONSHORE FLOW SO 

5976
03:14:09,104 --> 03:14:13,475
IT WILL TAKE A WILD FOR IT TO 

5977
03:14:13,475 --> 03:14:13,742
HAPPEN. 

5978
03:14:13,742 --> 03:14:15,243
IF YOU ARE AT THE BEACH, THAT 

5979
03:14:15,243 --> 03:14:15,710
WILL GO. 

5980
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:16,878
AS WE SAW WITH FLORENCE, SOME 

5981
03:14:16,878 --> 03:14:21,282
OF THE FRESHWATER FLOODING CAN 

5982
03:14:21,282 --> 03:14:22,250
LINGER FOR DAYS AND DAYS. 

5983
03:14:22,250 --> 03:14:23,351
THAT'S THE LAST THING THEY 

5984
03:14:23,351 --> 03:14:24,252
NEEDED IN THE CAROLINAS. 

5985
03:14:24,252 --> 03:14:25,053
FRESHWATER RIVER FLOODING FROM 

5986
03:14:25,053 --> 03:14:26,254
HEAVY RAIN BUT THEY ARE GOING 

5987
03:14:26,254 --> 03:14:27,055
TO GET IT AGAIN. 

5988
03:14:27,055 --> 03:14:28,456
>> THEY ARE GOING TO GET IT 

5989
03:14:28,456 --> 03:14:28,689
AGAIN. 

5990
03:14:28,689 --> 03:14:29,591
JEFF BERARDELLI, THANK YOU SO 

5991
03:14:29,591 --> 03:14:30,492
MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE. 

5992
03:14:30,492 --> 03:14:31,993
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK  

5993
03:14:31,993 --> 03:14:33,461
RAKE AND WILL BE BACK WITH MUCH 

5994
03:14:33,461 --> 03:14:33,761
MORE CBSN. 

5995
03:14:33,761 --> 03:14:34,462
STAY WITH US. 

5996
03:16:30,511 --> 03:16:32,013
>>> NICOLE KILLIAM IN PANAMA 

5997
03:16:32,013 --> 03:16:41,790
CITY BEACH  JOINS US ON THE 

5998
03:16:41,790 --> 03:16:42,023
PHONE. 

5999
03:16:42,023 --> 03:16:43,158
YOUR CREW WAS WORKING HARD TO 

6000
03:16:43,158 --> 03:16:43,892
KEEP UP THE GEAR. 

6001
03:16:43,892 --> 03:16:45,160
WE SEE FROM YOUR LIVE SHOT, 

6002
03:16:45,160 --> 03:16:46,194
THOSE TREES BLOWING IN THE 

6003
03:16:46,194 --> 03:16:46,394
WIND. 

6004
03:16:46,394 --> 03:16:47,896
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 

6005
03:16:47,896 --> 03:16:52,867
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. 

6006
03:16:52,867 --> 03:16:53,902
>> AT THIS POINT, WE'VE TAKEN 

6007
03:16:53,902 --> 03:16:55,470
SHELTER IN A HOTEL WHERE WE ARE 

6008
03:16:55,470 --> 03:16:56,538
STAYING, NOT TOO LONG AFTER WE 

6009
03:16:56,538 --> 03:16:57,872
DID THE LIVE SHOT, WE HAD TO 

6010
03:16:57,872 --> 03:16:59,040
COME IN BECAUSE AS THAT STORM 

6011
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:00,041
WAS MAKING LANDFALL, THE WIND 

6012
03:17:00,041 --> 03:17:01,142
AND RAIN REALLY GOT REALLY 

6013
03:17:01,142 --> 03:17:01,408
INTENSE. 

6014
03:17:01,408 --> 03:17:02,510
IN FACT AT TIMES, YOU COULD 

6015
03:17:02,510 --> 03:17:03,778
JUST SEE LITERALLY A WALL OF 

6016
03:17:03,778 --> 03:17:04,278
WATER PASS THROUGH. 

6017
03:17:04,278 --> 03:17:05,280
AND OF COURSE, THAT 

6018
03:17:05,280 --> 03:17:06,180
TRADITIONAL, CLASSIC SOUND OF A 

6019
03:17:06,180 --> 03:17:09,684
TRAIN THAT YOU HERE WITH THE 

6020
03:17:09,684 --> 03:17:10,318
STRONG WINDS GUSTING THROUGH. 

6021
03:17:10,318 --> 03:17:18,059
SO, WE HAVE KIND OF BEEN 

6022
03:17:18,059 --> 03:17:19,327
HANGING OUT, IF YOU WILL. 

6023
03:17:19,327 --> 03:17:20,461
MAYBE THAT IS TOO CASUAL A TERM 

6024
03:17:20,461 --> 03:17:21,162
IN THE HOTEL. 

6025
03:17:21,162 --> 03:17:22,096
WE'VE LOST POWER, EVEN SOME 

6026
03:17:22,096 --> 03:17:23,298
PARTS OF THE HOTEL ARE STARTING 

6027
03:17:23,298 --> 03:17:24,465
TO COME APART AS WELL. 

6028
03:17:24,465 --> 03:17:25,600
SOME OF THE CEILING TILES HAVE 

6029
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:26,034
COME DOWN. 

6030
03:17:26,034 --> 03:17:32,840
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME LEAKS 

6031
03:17:32,840 --> 03:17:33,975
COMING FROM THE CEILING. 

6032
03:17:33,975 --> 03:17:34,943
THERE ARE OTHER MEDIA HERE AS 

6033
03:17:34,943 --> 03:17:35,243
WELL. 

6034
03:17:35,243 --> 03:17:36,044
SO YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS 

6035
03:17:36,044 --> 03:17:36,945
TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE 

6036
03:17:36,945 --> 03:17:45,520
SITUATION AS BEST WE CAN. 

6037
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:46,854
IT DOES APPEAR AT THIS POINT IN 

6038
03:17:46,854 --> 03:17:48,055
TIME THAT SOME OF THE WINDS 

6039
03:17:48,055 --> 03:17:49,257
HAVE STARTED TO DIE DOWN. 

6040
03:17:49,257 --> 03:17:50,458
BUT AGAIN, WE KNOW WE ARE NOT 

6041
03:17:50,458 --> 03:17:51,859
OUT OF THE WOODS JUST YET. 

6042
03:17:51,859 --> 03:17:53,094
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU 

6043
03:17:53,094 --> 03:17:54,596
AND THE CREW WILL HAVE TO TAKE 

6044
03:17:54,596 --> 03:17:55,363
SHELTER AT THIS POINT? 

6045
03:17:55,363 --> 03:17:56,664
>> WELL, I ULD THINK FOR AT 

6046
03:17:56,664 --> 03:17:57,966
LEAST, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT HOUR 

6047
03:17:57,966 --> 03:17:58,933
OR TWO, UNTIL THESE CONDITIONS 

6048
03:17:58,933 --> 03:17:59,199
IMPROVE. 

6049
03:17:59,199 --> 03:18:00,134
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL DEBRIS 

6050
03:18:00,134 --> 03:18:01,436
BLOWING AROUND OUT THERE. 

6051
03:18:01,436 --> 03:18:04,305
IN FACT, THE POSITION WHERE WE 

6052
03:18:04,305 --> 03:18:05,640
WERE, WE JUST SAW AS I 

6053
03:18:05,640 --> 03:18:07,375
MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, A WALL OF 

6054
03:18:07,375 --> 03:18:10,511
WATER COMING THROUGH, AND KIND 

6055
03:18:10,511 --> 03:18:11,779
OF THE GRASSY SPACE BEHIND US 

6056
03:18:11,779 --> 03:18:12,347
FILLED WITH WATER. 

6057
03:18:12,347 --> 03:18:14,115
SOME OF THAT HAS RECEDED. 

6058
03:18:14,115 --> 03:18:16,517
BUT AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I'M 

6059
03:18:16,517 --> 03:18:17,685
LOOKING RIGHT NOW AT ALL TYPES 

6060
03:18:17,685 --> 03:18:18,953
OF DEBRIS, THAT IS ON THE 

6061
03:18:18,953 --> 03:18:19,253
GROUND. 

6062
03:18:19,253 --> 03:18:21,489
YOU KNOW, PIECES OF TREES, YOU 

6063
03:18:21,489 --> 03:18:28,162
KNOW, SMALL, LARGE, YOU KNOW, 

6064
03:18:28,162 --> 03:18:28,563
ALL SIZES. 

6065
03:18:28,563 --> 03:18:29,464
SO AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY WE WILL 

6066
03:18:29,464 --> 03:18:31,699
JUST HAVE TO KIND OF MAKE A 

6067
03:18:31,699 --> 03:18:32,232
DETERMINATION, AS THINGS 

6068
03:18:32,232 --> 03:18:33,067
PROGRESS. 

6069
03:18:33,067 --> 03:18:34,469
>> REMARKABLE TO SEE THAT YOU 

6070
03:18:34,469 --> 03:18:35,903
HAVE PIECES OF THE HOTEL COMING 

6071
03:18:35,903 --> 03:18:38,439
APART. 

6072
03:18:38,439 --> 03:18:39,841
WHAT HAS BEEN THE CONCERN WHEN 

6073
03:18:39,841 --> 03:18:40,808
YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS IN THAT 

6074
03:18:40,808 --> 03:18:41,142
AREA? 

6075
03:18:41,142 --> 03:18:42,677
WHAT'S THEIR BIG CONCERN AT 

6076
03:18:42,677 --> 03:18:44,379
THIS MOMENT? 

6077
03:18:44,379 --> 03:18:45,646
>> WELL, A COUPLE OF THINGS. 

6078
03:18:45,646 --> 03:18:47,315
THE MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE 

6079
03:18:47,315 --> 03:18:51,953
LOCAL AUTHORITY HAD PEOPLE WHO 

6080
03:18:51,953 --> 03:18:53,388
CHOSE TO RIDE OUT THE STORM AND 

6081
03:18:53,388 --> 03:18:54,522
DID NOT EVACUATE, AND, THERE 

6082
03:18:54,522 --> 03:18:55,289
HAVE BEEN SHELTERS THAT HAS 

6083
03:18:55,289 --> 03:18:59,293
BEEN SET UP FOR THOSE FOLKS. 

6084
03:18:59,293 --> 03:19:00,261
BUT, THERE ARE CLEARLY FOLKS 

6085
03:19:00,261 --> 03:19:01,796
WHO DID NOT HEED THE WARNINGS. 

6086
03:19:01,796 --> 03:19:02,497
IN FACT, RIGHT BEFORE THINGS 

6087
03:19:02,497 --> 03:19:10,171
REALLY PICKED UP,  WE HAD AN 

6088
03:19:10,171 --> 03:19:11,172
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE 

6089
03:19:11,172 --> 03:19:12,040
POLICE CHIEF OF PANAMA CITY 

6090
03:19:12,040 --> 03:19:12,307
BEACH. 

6091
03:19:12,307 --> 03:19:13,074
AND HE SAID, LOOK. 

6092
03:19:13,074 --> 03:19:14,442
I CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO LEAVE 

6093
03:19:14,442 --> 03:19:14,775
THEIR HOMES. 

6094
03:19:14,775 --> 03:19:15,910
AND YOU KNOW, AT A CERTAIN 

6095
03:19:15,910 --> 03:19:17,311
POINT IN TIME, YOU KNOW, HE HAS 

6096
03:19:17,311 --> 03:19:19,013
TO PROTECT HIS OWN FORCE. 

6097
03:19:19,013 --> 03:19:20,048
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

6098
03:19:20,048 --> 03:19:21,449
>> YOU KNOW, WE DID SEE LOCAL 

6099
03:19:21,449 --> 03:19:22,249
AUTHORITIES STAY AT A CERTAIN 

6100
03:19:22,249 --> 03:19:23,684
POINT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO 

6101
03:19:23,684 --> 03:19:25,686
COME OUT AND SAVE YOU. 

6102
03:19:25,686 --> 03:19:26,487
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR 

6103
03:19:26,487 --> 03:19:27,055
CONVEYED AS WELL. 

6104
03:19:27,055 --> 03:19:28,656
YOU KNOW, UNTIL THE CONDITIONS 

6105
03:19:28,656 --> 03:19:28,923
IMPROVE. 

6106
03:19:28,923 --> 03:19:34,195
>> FORTUNATELY, GOVERNOR RICK 

6107
03:19:34,195 --> 03:19:35,363
SCOTT HAS A GREAT DEAL OF 

6108
03:19:35,363 --> 03:19:36,164
EXPERIENCE, IN DEALING WITH 

6109
03:19:36,164 --> 03:19:37,265
HURRICANES AND GETTING THE WORD 

6110
03:19:37,265 --> 03:19:37,465
OUT. 

6111
03:19:37,465 --> 03:19:39,100
WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING THE 

6112
03:19:39,100 --> 03:19:40,868
PAST FEW HOURS? 

6113
03:19:40,868 --> 03:19:42,069
>> HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO 

6114
03:19:42,069 --> 03:19:43,171
EMPHASIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS IS, 

6115
03:19:43,171 --> 03:19:44,105
AND HOW SERIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD 

6116
03:19:44,105 --> 03:19:44,906
TAKE THIS. 

6117
03:19:44,906 --> 03:19:46,073
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A 

6118
03:19:46,073 --> 03:19:52,213
STORM, THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS 

6119
03:19:52,213 --> 03:19:53,681
STORM IS ONE THAT THIS PART OF 

6120
03:19:53,681 --> 03:19:54,282
FLORIDA HASN'T SEEN, OR 

6121
03:19:54,282 --> 03:19:55,383
EXPERIENCED IN AT LEAST A 

6122
03:19:55,383 --> 03:19:55,649
CENTURY. 

6123
03:19:55,649 --> 03:20:00,388
HE MADE THAT CLEAR. 

6124
03:20:00,388 --> 03:20:01,756
AND, I THINK WHAT SURPRISED US 

6125
03:20:01,756 --> 03:20:02,690
ALL IS THE INTENSITY OF THIS 

6126
03:20:02,690 --> 03:20:02,957
STORM. 

6127
03:20:02,957 --> 03:20:04,092
THIS CAME ASHORE AT 155 MILES 

6128
03:20:04,092 --> 03:20:04,659
PER HOUR. 

6129
03:20:04,659 --> 03:20:13,835
JUST SHY OF A CATEGORY FIVE. 

6130
03:20:13,835 --> 03:20:14,902
AND YOU KNOW, TO WATCH HOW 

6131
03:20:14,902 --> 03:20:16,104
RAPIDLY IT PICKED UP IN 

6132
03:20:16,104 --> 03:20:17,004
STRENGTH, I PERSONALLY THINK IS 

6133
03:20:17,004 --> 03:20:17,705
JUST REMARKABLE. 

6134
03:20:17,705 --> 03:20:18,272
>> WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE, 

6135
03:20:18,272 --> 03:20:18,539
NICOLE? 

6136
03:20:18,539 --> 03:20:20,908
AS WE WERE WATCHING YOU, WE SAW 

6137
03:20:20,908 --> 03:20:22,176
WHAT APPEARED TO BE YOUR CAMERA 

6138
03:20:22,176 --> 03:20:22,676
GEAR MOVING AROUND. 

6139
03:20:22,676 --> 03:20:23,811
YOUR PRODUCER THERE STEPPING IN 

6140
03:20:23,811 --> 03:20:25,680
TO MAKE SURE IT LOOKED LIKE IT 

6141
03:20:25,680 --> 03:20:35,789
WASN'T HITTING YOU. 

6142
03:20:35,789 --> 03:20:36,657
HOW DID IT JUST DETERIORATE, TO 

6143
03:20:36,657 --> 03:20:37,859
FORCE YOU TO STAY, TO SEEK 

6144
03:20:37,859 --> 03:20:38,860
SHELTER INSIDE OF A HOTEL? 

6145
03:20:38,860 --> 03:20:40,461
>> WELL AGAIN, THIS WAS AT THE 

6146
03:20:40,461 --> 03:20:41,562
CLIMAX OF THE STORM, RIGHT AS 

6147
03:20:41,562 --> 03:20:42,563
IT WAS COMING THROUGH, MAKING 

6148
03:20:42,563 --> 03:20:42,863
LANDFALL. 

6149
03:20:42,863 --> 03:20:43,564
THAT'S WHERE THE STRONGEST 

6150
03:20:43,564 --> 03:20:44,098
WINDS ARE. 

6151
03:20:44,098 --> 03:20:45,666
SO IT JUST GOT TO A POINT WHERE 

6152
03:20:45,666 --> 03:20:47,001
YES, IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO 

6153
03:20:47,001 --> 03:20:47,869
STAND, AND WE CONTINUED TO SEE. 

6154
03:20:47,869 --> 03:20:50,538
I THINK DURING THE SHOT, WE 

6155
03:20:50,538 --> 03:20:51,806
POINTED OUT A ROOF THAT WAS 

6156
03:20:51,806 --> 03:20:52,840
COMING APART, AND AN AUTO BODY 

6157
03:20:52,840 --> 03:20:53,040
SHOP. 

6158
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:54,041
AND, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY BEING 

6159
03:20:54,041 --> 03:20:58,546
OUT IN THOSE CONDITIONS, YOU 

6160
03:20:58,546 --> 03:20:59,747
DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE FLYING 

6161
03:20:59,747 --> 03:21:00,348
THROUGH THE AIR. 

6162
03:21:00,348 --> 03:21:01,749
SO, THAT'S WHY WE MADE THE CALL 

6163
03:21:01,749 --> 03:21:03,484
THAT EVEN AS SOON AS WE CAME IN 

6164
03:21:03,484 --> 03:21:04,786
AND BROUGHT ALL OF OUR GEAR IN, 

6165
03:21:04,786 --> 03:21:06,454
THE DOOR LEADING OUTSIDE, KEPT 

6166
03:21:06,454 --> 03:21:06,854
BLOWING OPEN. 

6167
03:21:06,854 --> 03:21:10,091
SO, LITERALLY, OUR CREW, AND, 

6168
03:21:10,091 --> 03:21:15,763
YOU KNOW, THE TWO PEOPLE WHO 

6169
03:21:15,763 --> 03:21:17,064
ARE MANNING THIS HOTEL FOR US, 

6170
03:21:17,064 --> 03:21:18,466
TO TRY TO TIE THE DOOR DOWN AND 

6171
03:21:18,466 --> 03:21:20,268
KEEP IT SHUT SO THAT WE DID NOT 

6172
03:21:20,268 --> 03:21:21,269
GET THOSE GUSTS COMING INTO THE 

6173
03:21:21,269 --> 03:21:22,370
HALLWAY, THINKING THAT WE WERE 

6174
03:21:22,370 --> 03:21:25,406
SEEKING SHELTER, WHEN REALLY, 

6175
03:21:25,406 --> 03:21:26,507
WE WERE ONCE AGAIN EXPOSED TO 

6176
03:21:26,507 --> 03:21:26,907
MORE RISK. 

6177
03:21:26,907 --> 03:21:27,408
>> INCREDIBLE. 

6178
03:21:27,408 --> 03:21:28,543
NICOLE, GLAD YOU AND THE CREW 

6179
03:21:28,543 --> 03:21:29,443
ARE SAFE AND SEEKING SHELTER. 

6180
03:21:29,443 --> 03:21:35,483
WE WILL CHECK CHECK IN WITH YOU 

6181
03:21:35,483 --> 03:21:36,184
THROUGHOUT THIS AFTERNOON. 

6182
03:21:36,184 --> 03:21:36,784
THANK YOU, NICOLE. 

6183
03:21:36,784 --> 03:21:38,085
I WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 

6184
03:21:38,085 --> 03:21:41,889
CORRESPONDENT OMAR VILLAFRANCA. 

6185
03:21:41,889 --> 03:21:43,524
HE JOINS US FROM PORT SAINT JOE 

6186
03:21:43,524 --> 03:21:43,824
IN FLORIDA. 

6187
03:21:43,824 --> 03:21:44,759
HE IS ON THE PHONE. 

6188
03:21:44,759 --> 03:21:45,693
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 

6189
03:21:45,693 --> 03:21:46,026
EXPERIENCING. 

6190
03:21:46,026 --> 03:21:47,061
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE 

6191
03:21:47,061 --> 03:21:48,362
STARTING TO GET SOME OF THE 

6192
03:21:48,362 --> 03:21:49,964
BACKSIDE OF THE BANDS OF 

6193
03:21:49,964 --> 03:21:50,598
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

6194
03:21:50,598 --> 03:21:51,966
WE SAW PLENTY OF WIND, AS THE 

6195
03:21:51,966 --> 03:21:58,406
STORM SYSTEM IS MOVING ONSHORE. 

6196
03:21:58,406 --> 03:21:59,640
SO, THE TREES THAT ARE DOTTING 

6197
03:21:59,640 --> 03:22:00,708
ALL OF THE LANDSCAPE HERE WERE 

6198
03:22:00,708 --> 03:22:01,942
JUST BENDING OVER SIDEWAYS. 

6199
03:22:01,942 --> 03:22:05,880
AND, WE SAW TREES SNAP. 

6200
03:22:05,880 --> 03:22:07,147
WE SAW PIECES OF BUILDING THAT 

6201
03:22:07,147 --> 03:22:07,748
WERE COMING OFF. 

6202
03:22:07,748 --> 03:22:11,919
POWER IS OUT IN THIS AREA OF 

6203
03:22:11,919 --> 03:22:12,453
GULF COUNTY. 

6204
03:22:12,453 --> 03:22:13,487
AND, THAT'S GOING TO BE 

6205
03:22:13,487 --> 03:22:14,255
SOMETHING THAT FOLKS WILL HAVE 

6206
03:22:14,255 --> 03:22:17,358
TO DEAL WITH FOR SEVERAL DAYS, 

6207
03:22:17,358 --> 03:22:18,059
AND MAYBE EVEN LONGER. 

6208
03:22:18,059 --> 03:22:19,260
STORM SURGE OF COURSE, ALWAYS A 

6209
03:22:19,260 --> 03:22:20,294
BIG CONCERN. 

6210
03:22:20,294 --> 03:22:27,568
PEOPLE ARE STAYING OFF THE 

6211
03:22:27,568 --> 03:22:27,801
ROADS. 

6212
03:22:27,801 --> 03:22:28,569
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 

6213
03:22:28,569 --> 03:22:29,637
THE BAD NEWS IS, THAT STORM 

6214
03:22:29,637 --> 03:22:30,471
SURGE CAME WITH FURY. 

6215
03:22:30,471 --> 03:22:31,639
IN THE MATTER OF MINUTES, WE 

6216
03:22:31,639 --> 03:22:33,207
SAW WATER ON THE ROAD THAT WAS 

6217
03:22:33,207 --> 03:22:33,941
JUST A FEW INCHES. 

6218
03:22:33,941 --> 03:22:35,109
WENT UP TO ALMOST 2 FEET. 

6219
03:22:35,109 --> 03:22:36,110
IT WAS MOVING VERY, VERY 

6220
03:22:36,110 --> 03:22:36,376
QUICKLY. 

6221
03:22:36,376 --> 03:22:43,551
THIS ONE, LITERALLY PARKED TO 

6222
03:22:43,551 --> 03:22:44,952
GET SOME SHOTS OF VIDEO AND IT 

6223
03:22:44,952 --> 03:22:45,886
WAS RISING UP VERY FAST. 

6224
03:22:45,886 --> 03:22:47,088
BUT, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 

6225
03:22:47,088 --> 03:22:47,655
HUNKERED DOWN. 

6226
03:22:47,655 --> 03:22:49,090
THERE WAS AN EVACUATION ORDER 

6227
03:22:49,090 --> 03:22:50,591
IN THE AREA, ROUGHLY 3500 

6228
03:22:50,591 --> 03:22:51,759
PEOPLE LIVE IN PORT SAINT JOE. 

6229
03:22:51,759 --> 03:22:52,459
BUT, THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT WAS 

6230
03:22:52,459 --> 03:22:53,561
TELLING US THAT THEY BELIEVE 

6231
03:22:53,561 --> 03:22:54,762
60%, MORE THAN HALF OF THE 

6232
03:22:54,762 --> 03:22:55,329
PEOPLE, BASICALLY WERE 

6233
03:22:55,329 --> 03:22:58,199
GATHERING SUPPLIES AND WERE 

6234
03:22:58,199 --> 03:23:07,074
HUNKERING DOWN. 

6235
03:23:07,074 --> 03:23:08,409
THERE IS A SMALL LITTLE MOTEL 

6236
03:23:08,409 --> 03:23:09,544
AROUND HERE AND THE PARKING LOT 

6237
03:23:09,544 --> 03:23:10,844
IS PACKED AND FULL OF LOCALS 

6238
03:23:10,844 --> 03:23:12,113
WHO MAY BE AT VACATION HOMES OR 

6239
03:23:12,113 --> 03:23:13,347
HOMES NEAR THE WATER AND THEY 

6240
03:23:13,347 --> 03:23:14,549
DECIDED TO COME A LITTLE BIT 

6241
03:23:14,549 --> 03:23:15,650
FURTHER INLAND, JUST IN CASE. 

6242
03:23:15,650 --> 03:23:17,918
THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH 

6243
03:23:17,918 --> 03:23:18,285
STORM SURGE. 

6244
03:23:18,285 --> 03:23:19,554
>> REALLY QUICKLY, YOU SAID 60% 

6245
03:23:19,554 --> 03:23:22,189
OF PEOPLE CHOSE TO STAY AND 

6246
03:23:22,189 --> 03:23:26,661
HUNKER DOWN. 

6247
03:23:26,661 --> 03:23:26,961
>> YEAH. 

6248
03:23:26,961 --> 03:23:28,162
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE 

6249
03:23:28,162 --> 03:23:28,963
SHERIFF DEPARTMENT WAS NOT 

6250
03:23:28,963 --> 03:23:30,364
GOING TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND 

6251
03:23:30,364 --> 03:23:31,599
PULL PEOPLE OUT, EVEN THOUGH IT 

6252
03:23:31,599 --> 03:23:32,266
WAS A MANDATORY EVACUATION. 

6253
03:23:32,266 --> 03:23:33,467
THEY STILL HAD THAT KIND OF 

6254
03:23:33,467 --> 03:23:33,734
MANPOWER. 

6255
03:23:33,734 --> 03:23:35,903
BUT, PEOPLE ARE AT THEIR OWN 

6256
03:23:35,903 --> 03:23:41,242
RISK. 

6257
03:23:41,242 --> 03:23:42,076
OVER HERE, IT'S CLOSED. 

6258
03:23:42,076 --> 03:23:42,910
THE AMBULANCES ARE INLAND. 

6259
03:23:42,910 --> 03:23:43,711
ONE OF THE COUNTY 

6260
03:23:43,711 --> 03:23:44,579
COMMISSIONERS, WE SAW THEM 

6261
03:23:44,579 --> 03:23:46,113
SURVEYING SOME OF THE DAMAGE, 

6262
03:23:46,113 --> 03:23:51,852
BEFORE THE EYE HIT. 

6263
03:23:51,852 --> 03:23:52,954
HE BASICALLY SAID, IF ANYBODY 

6264
03:23:52,954 --> 03:23:54,088
HAS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AT THIS 

6265
03:23:54,088 --> 03:23:55,289
POINT, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 

6266
03:23:55,289 --> 03:23:58,092
TO WAIT UNTIL THE HURRICANE 

6267
03:23:58,092 --> 03:24:00,061
PATH  IS IN THE FACE OF CERTAIN 

6268
03:24:00,061 --> 03:24:00,962
RESPONDERS TO GET OUT. 

6269
03:24:00,962 --> 03:24:01,963
THAT'S WHY THEY PUT OTHER 

6270
03:24:01,963 --> 03:24:02,563

03:30:43,764 --> 03:30:44,732
CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO REALLY 

6452
03:30:44,732 --> 03:30:45,565
START TO DETERIORATE. 

6453
03:30:45,565 --> 03:30:46,667
THE BIG CONCERN HERE IS CLEARLY 

6454
03:30:46,667 --> 03:30:47,468
NOT GOING TO BE COASTAL 

6455
03:30:47,468 --> 03:30:50,037
FLOODING, OR STORM SURGE. 

6456
03:30:50,037 --> 03:30:51,171
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS. 

6457
03:30:51,171 --> 03:30:51,839
SO MANY TREES HERE. 

6458
03:30:51,839 --> 03:30:53,941
AND, ANY OF THEM THAT ARE OLD 

6459
03:30:53,941 --> 03:30:57,711
OR DYING, OR SIMPLY CANNOT 

6460
03:30:57,711 --> 03:30:58,746
HANDLE THE HURRICANE FORCE 

6461
03:30:58,746 --> 03:30:59,546
WINDS, WELL, THOSE BRANCHES AND 

6462
03:30:59,546 --> 03:31:00,748
TREES ARE EXPECTED TO COME DOWN 

6463
03:31:00,748 --> 03:31:01,448
ONTO HOMES, ONTO BUILDINGS, 

6464
03:31:01,448 --> 03:31:03,217
WHICH OF COURSE COULD CAUSE 

6465
03:31:03,217 --> 03:31:05,753
INJURY OR DEATH. 

6466
03:31:05,753 --> 03:31:06,754
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WANTING TO 

6467
03:31:06,754 --> 03:31:07,855
GET PEOPLE INTO SHELTERS, AWAY 

6468
03:31:07,855 --> 03:31:08,989
FROM TREES. 

6469
03:31:08,989 --> 03:31:15,362
BUT ALSO, THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE 

6470
03:31:15,362 --> 03:31:16,063
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE POWER 

6471
03:31:16,063 --> 03:31:16,730
OUTAGES EXPECTED THROUGHOUT 

6472
03:31:16,730 --> 03:31:17,164
THIS AREA. 

6473
03:31:17,164 --> 03:31:18,465
SO, IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH, 

6474
03:31:18,465 --> 03:31:19,466
LATE AFTERNOON TO EVENING FOR 

6475
03:31:19,466 --> 03:31:22,603
THE TALLAHASSEE AREA. 

6476
03:31:22,603 --> 03:31:23,837
THEN, IT MOVES ON OUT OF HERE. 

6477
03:31:23,837 --> 03:31:25,505
AND THEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE 

6478
03:31:25,505 --> 03:31:26,039
DAMAGE EFT BEHIND. 

6479
03:31:26,039 --> 03:31:28,175
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT AS FAR 

6480
03:31:28,175 --> 03:31:29,610
AS POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE 

6481
03:31:29,610 --> 03:31:30,444
WINDS START TO REALLY GET 

6482
03:31:30,444 --> 03:31:31,511
CONSISTENT, AT ABOUT 35 MILES 

6483
03:31:31,511 --> 03:31:34,181
PER HOUR, AND WE MAY BE THERE 

6484
03:31:34,181 --> 03:31:42,556
VERY SOON, THAT IS WHEN THE 

6485
03:31:42,556 --> 03:31:43,457
POWER COMPANY SAYS IT'S NO 

6486
03:31:43,457 --> 03:31:44,858
LONGER SAFE FOR THEIR CRUISE TO 

6487
03:31:44,858 --> 03:31:45,959
BE OUT AND ABOUT, TRYING TO 

6488
03:31:45,959 --> 03:31:46,659
RESTORE WHATEVER POWERLINES MAY 

6489
03:31:46,659 --> 03:31:47,761
HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN VERY 

6490
03:31:47,761 --> 03:31:48,762
EARLY ON IN THE STORM. 

6491
03:31:48,762 --> 03:31:50,197
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE DOING 

6492
03:31:50,197 --> 03:31:51,465
THAT ANYMORE SO IT MAY NOT BE 

6493
03:31:51,465 --> 03:31:52,466
UNTIL TOMORROW WHEN THEY GET 

6494
03:31:52,466 --> 03:31:53,567
SOME DAYLIGHT AND THE WINDS 

6495
03:31:53,567 --> 03:31:54,668
HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS AREA, 

6496
03:31:54,668 --> 03:31:55,769
THAT THEY ARE FINALLY ABLE TO 

6497
03:31:55,769 --> 03:31:56,704
START ONE, CLEARING TREES, AND 

6498
03:31:56,704 --> 03:31:57,504
TWO, RESTORE POWER. 

6499
03:31:57,504 --> 03:31:58,438
THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES WHEN IT 

6500
03:31:58,438 --> 03:31:59,406
COMES TO RESTORING POWER. 

6501
03:31:59,406 --> 03:32:00,140
THE HOSPITALS, NURSING HOMES, 

6502
03:32:00,140 --> 03:32:03,677
THE ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, 

6503
03:32:03,677 --> 03:32:04,945
THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY WILL 

6504
03:32:04,945 --> 03:32:06,280
TRY TO GET BACK ONLINE FIRST, 

6505
03:32:06,280 --> 03:32:06,913
CLEARLY, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. 

6506
03:32:06,913 --> 03:32:08,148
THOSE OF PEOPLE WHO NEED THE 

6507
03:32:08,148 --> 03:32:09,850
POWER THE MOST, AND THE MOST 

6508
03:32:09,850 --> 03:32:10,184
QUICKLY. 

6509
03:32:10,184 --> 03:32:13,287
BUT, IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH 

6510
03:32:13,287 --> 03:32:14,454
GOING HERE IN TALLAHASSEE AS WE 

6511
03:32:14,454 --> 03:32:15,455
ARE STARTING TO SEE THOSE 

6512
03:32:15,455 --> 03:32:19,393
REPORTS FROM THE COAST. 

6513
03:32:19,393 --> 03:32:20,294
AND, A SLIGHTLY WEAKER VERSION 

6514
03:32:20,294 --> 03:32:21,662
OF MICHAEL BEGINS TO MAKE ITS 

6515
03:32:21,662 --> 03:32:22,462
WAY HERE INTO THE STATE'S 

6516
03:32:22,462 --> 03:32:23,230
CAPITAL. 

6517
03:32:23,230 --> 03:32:24,364
>> MANNY, YOU LIVE IN MIAMI. 

6518
03:32:24,364 --> 03:32:25,065
YOU KNOW ABOUT HURRICANE 

6519
03:32:25,065 --> 03:32:29,837
COVERAGE AND PREPARATION. 

6520
03:32:29,837 --> 03:32:31,071
I'M JUST CURIOUS, OF THE FOLKS 

6521
03:32:31,071 --> 03:32:32,272
THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO, WHAT 

6522
03:32:32,272 --> 03:32:33,774
ARE THE STORES LIKE THERE? 

6523
03:32:33,774 --> 03:32:37,311
THE GAS LINES. 

6524
03:32:37,311 --> 03:32:38,579
AND, WHAT DO PEOPLE ADVISE YOU, 

6525
03:32:38,579 --> 03:32:39,713
WHEN YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN 

6526
03:32:39,713 --> 03:32:39,946
COMING? 

6527
03:32:39,946 --> 03:32:44,852
>> Reporter: WELL, WE GOT HERE, 

6528
03:32:44,852 --> 03:32:46,086
AND AS YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LAND 

6529
03:32:46,086 --> 03:32:47,454
IN ONE OF THESE AREAS RIGHT 

6530
03:32:47,454 --> 03:32:48,455
BEFORE DISASTER, YOU GO AND 

6531
03:32:48,455 --> 03:32:49,456
LOOK FOR WATER FOR YOUR CREWS 

6532
03:32:49,456 --> 03:32:51,058
AND FOR YOURSELF. 

6533
03:32:51,058 --> 03:32:52,059
IMMEDIATELY, THE FIRST WALMART 

6534
03:32:52,059 --> 03:32:53,760
I WENT TO WAS OUT OF BREAD COME 

6535
03:32:53,760 --> 03:32:54,394
OUT OF WATER. 

6536
03:32:54,394 --> 03:32:55,295
PEOPLE DID PREPARE. 

6537
03:32:55,295 --> 03:32:55,795
THERE WERE GAS LINES. 

6538
03:32:55,795 --> 03:32:57,030
WE AREN'T SEEING AS MANY OF 

6539
03:32:57,030 --> 03:32:57,263
THOSE. 

6540
03:32:57,263 --> 03:32:57,864
THAT'S BECAUSE GAS STATIONS 

6541
03:32:57,864 --> 03:32:59,099
HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP UP THEIR 

6542
03:32:59,099 --> 03:33:01,001
PUMPS, HOPING TO SAVE THEM FROM 

6543
03:33:01,001 --> 03:33:02,102
ANY WATER DAMAGE. 

6544
03:33:02,102 --> 03:33:03,503
SO AT THIS POINT, AND WE FOR 

6545
03:33:03,503 --> 03:33:04,838
THE OFFICIALS SAY IT OVER AND 

6546
03:33:04,838 --> 03:33:06,306
OVER, IF YOU ARE NO LONGER 

6547
03:33:06,306 --> 03:33:16,150
PREPARED, OR IF YOU ARE STILL 

6548
03:33:16,150 --> 03:33:17,151
TRYING TO PREPARE, I SHOULD 

6549
03:33:17,151 --> 03:33:18,285
SAY, THE TIME IS REALLY UP. 

6550
03:33:18,285 --> 03:33:19,553
RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST BRACE FOR 

6551
03:33:19,553 --> 03:33:19,853
IT. 

6552
03:33:19,853 --> 03:33:20,720
HUNKER DOWN, GET INDOORS, SOWS, 

6553
03:33:20,720 --> 03:33:22,055
TO THE INNERMOST PART OF ANY 

6554
03:33:22,055 --> 03:33:22,322
BUILDING. 

6555
03:33:22,322 --> 03:33:23,356
YOU MENTIONED  THE LESSONS 

6556
03:33:23,356 --> 03:33:24,057
LEARNED, FROM LIVING IN SOUTH 

6557
03:33:24,057 --> 03:33:31,932
FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY AFTER IRMA 

6558
03:33:31,932 --> 03:33:32,366
LAST YEAR. 

6559
03:33:32,366 --> 03:33:33,734
YOU WILL RECALL THERE WAS THAT 

6560
03:33:33,734 --> 03:33:34,635
HORRIBLE INCIDENT AT A NURSING 

6561
03:33:34,635 --> 03:33:35,736
HOME WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER 

6562
03:33:35,736 --> 03:33:36,904
THE POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOR 

6563
03:33:36,904 --> 03:33:37,137
DAYS. 

6564
03:33:37,137 --> 03:33:38,538
AND, THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 

6565
03:33:38,538 --> 03:33:39,439
THE POWER BACK INTO THE 

6566
03:33:39,439 --> 03:33:39,739
BUILDING.  

6567
03:33:39,739 --> 03:33:40,541
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 

6568
03:33:40,541 --> 03:33:40,841
GENERATOR. 

6569
03:33:40,841 --> 03:33:42,075
THERE IS A NEW LAW HERE IN 

6570
03:33:42,075 --> 03:33:43,143
FLORIDA THAT IS AIMING TO 

6571
03:33:43,143 --> 03:33:44,311
PREVENT THAT KIND OF A TRAGEDY 

6572
03:33:44,311 --> 03:33:44,911
FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. 

6573
03:33:44,911 --> 03:33:45,846
AND, REQUIRING ALL NURSING 

6574
03:33:45,846 --> 03:33:47,114
HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING 

6575
03:33:47,114 --> 03:33:51,485
FACILITIES TO HAVE GENERATORS. 

6576
03:33:51,485 --> 03:33:52,486
BUT, AFTER THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 

6577
03:33:52,486 --> 03:33:53,687
1st PAST, NUMBERS SHOWED THAT A 

6578
03:33:53,687 --> 03:34:00,360
LOT OF THOSE FACILITIES, 

6579
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:01,595
ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA, DO NOT 

6580
03:34:01,595 --> 03:34:02,563
HAVE THOSE INSTALLED JUST YET 

6581
03:34:02,563 --> 03:34:03,197
FOR MANY REASONS. 

6582
03:34:03,197 --> 03:34:03,630
ZONING REGULATIONS. 

6583
03:34:03,630 --> 03:34:04,965
WE ARE TOLD THERE IS A LABOR 

6584
03:34:04,965 --> 03:34:06,532
SHORTAGE AND ALSO A SHORTAGE OF 

6585
03:34:06,532 --> 03:34:11,271
THOSE SUPPLIES. 

6586
03:34:11,271 --> 03:34:12,439
BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO PROVE 

6587
03:34:12,439 --> 03:34:13,507
THEY CAN KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE. 

6588
03:34:13,507 --> 03:34:14,508
AND, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE 

6589
03:34:14,508 --> 03:34:15,442
STATE IS LOOKING VERY CLOSELY 

6590
03:34:15,442 --> 03:34:16,643
INTO, AND THAT'S WHY THE POWER 

6591
03:34:16,643 --> 03:34:17,611
COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO 

6592
03:34:17,611 --> 03:34:18,311
PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS, TO 

6593
03:34:18,311 --> 03:34:19,279
PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE THAT FROM 

6594
03:34:19,279 --> 03:34:19,846
HAPPENING AGAIN. 

6595
03:34:19,846 --> 03:34:20,948
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE 

6596
03:34:20,948 --> 03:34:22,082
TREES, THEY REALLY GET GOING. 

6597
03:34:22,082 --> 03:34:26,553
AND, THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THAT, 

6598
03:34:26,553 --> 03:34:27,654
IT'S STARTING TO BECOME A 

6599
03:34:27,654 --> 03:34:28,255
LITTLE MORE CONSISTENT. 

6600
03:34:28,255 --> 03:34:29,656
IT IS NO LONGER ONCE EVERY 10 

6601
03:34:29,656 --> 03:34:29,923
MINUTES. 

6602
03:34:29,923 --> 03:34:30,791
IT'S STARTING TO BECOME A 

6603
03:34:30,791 --> 03:34:31,858
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A REGULAR 

6604
03:34:31,858 --> 03:34:32,559
FLW THROUGH HERE. 

6605
03:34:32,559 --> 03:34:33,794
SO CURRENTLY, MICHAEL IS 

6606
03:34:33,794 --> 03:34:37,931
GETTING CLOSER. 

6607
03:34:37,931 --> 03:34:39,032
>> INTERESTING, YOU POINT OUT 

6608
03:34:39,032 --> 03:34:39,232
THAT. 

6609
03:34:39,232 --> 03:34:40,367
PLEASE STAY SAFE, WE WILL CHECK 

6610
03:34:40,367 --> 03:34:41,969
BACK IN WITH YOU AND THE CREW 

6611
03:34:41,969 --> 03:34:43,337
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON. 

6612
03:34:43,337 --> 03:34:44,237
THANKS SO MUCH, MANNY. 

6613
03:34:44,237 --> 03:34:45,405
>>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 

6614
03:34:45,405 --> 03:34:46,874
MONITORING HURRICANE MICHAEL AS 

6615
03:34:46,874 --> 03:34:50,110
IT MAKES LANDFALL.  

6616
03:34:50,110 --> 03:34:50,844
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE, DAMAGING 

6617
03:34:50,844 --> 03:34:51,945
WINDS, 150 MILES AN HOUR. 

6618
03:34:51,945 --> 03:34:52,913
WE'LL HAVE SO MUCH MORE. 

6619
03:34:52,913 --> 03:34:53,480
STAY WITH US. 

6620
03:34:53,480 --> 03:34:54,381
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.  

6621
03:34:54,381 --> 03:34:54,848
ALWAYS ON. 

6622
03:34:57,584 --> 03:35:03,090
>>> ON THE "CBS EVENING NEWS," 

6623
03:35:03,090 --> 03:35:04,157
FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE, 

6624
03:35:04,157 --> 03:35:04,657
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY. 

6625
03:35:04,657 --> 03:35:10,097
>> AT 12 NOON, HIGH TIDE ROLLED 

6626
03:35:10,097 --> 03:35:14,934
IN. 

6627
03:35:14,934 --> 03:35:16,169
>> RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T TELL 

6628
03:35:16,169 --> 03:35:17,270
THE RIVERS FROM THE ROADS.

03:42:41,513 --> 03:42:44,050
>> MICHAEL FEELS LIKE A NORMAL 

6809
03:42:44,050 --> 03:42:44,450
HURRICANE SHOULD. 

6810
03:42:44,450 --> 03:42:44,684
RIGHT? 

6811
03:42:44,684 --> 03:42:46,853
WHICH IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE 

6812
03:42:46,853 --> 03:42:48,054
ANY SORT OF ATMOSPHERIC 

6813
03:42:48,054 --> 03:42:49,455
BLOCKING OR SOMETHING GUMMING 

6814
03:42:49,455 --> 03:42:50,957
UP THE WORKS OF FORWARD 

6815
03:42:50,957 --> 03:42:52,959
PROGRESS, THIS IS AROUND THE 

6816
03:42:52,959 --> 03:42:53,492
SPEED THAT YOU WOULD GET. 

6817
03:42:53,492 --> 03:42:56,696
10 TO 20 MILES AN HOUR RANGE. 

6818
03:42:56,696 --> 03:42:58,231
>> SO IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FAST? 

6819
03:42:58,231 --> 03:43:01,334
>> NO, BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT 

6820
03:43:01,334 --> 03:43:03,903
TO HARVEY OR FLORENCE OR IRMA, 

6821
03:43:03,903 --> 03:43:05,805
THIS IS MUCH FASTER THAN ANY OF 

6822
03:43:05,805 --> 03:43:06,138
THOSE STORMS. 

6823
03:43:06,138 --> 03:43:07,740
>> AND WHERE IS IT EVENTUALLY 

6824
03:43:07,740 --> 03:43:08,007
HEADED? 

6825
03:43:08,007 --> 03:43:12,645
WILL IT REACH US ON THE EAST 

6826
03:43:12,645 --> 03:43:12,878
COAST? 

6827
03:43:12,878 --> 03:43:14,280
>> IT WILL GET UP TO THE 

6828
03:43:14,280 --> 03:43:16,950
CHESAPEAKE AND MAKE ITS WAY OFF 

6829
03:43:16,950 --> 03:43:17,250
THE COAST. 

6830
03:43:17,250 --> 03:43:17,750
WE'LL SEE BREEZY WINDY 

6831
03:43:17,750 --> 03:43:18,952
CONDITIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. 

6832
03:43:18,952 --> 03:43:20,753
30 MILES AN HOUR WIND GUSTS. 

6833
03:43:20,753 --> 03:43:26,259
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE TAKE IN THE 

6834
03:43:26,259 --> 03:43:27,560
PATIO FURNITURE FROM BALCONIES. 

6835
03:43:27,560 --> 03:43:28,694
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. 

6836
03:43:28,694 --> 03:43:30,263
BUT THE PLACES I'M MOST 

6837
03:43:30,263 --> 03:43:34,100
CONCERNED ABOUT TOMORROW, 

6838
03:43:34,100 --> 03:43:39,739
CENTRAL NORTH CAROLINA, CENTRAL 

6839
03:43:39,739 --> 03:43:41,541
SOUTH CAROLINA. 

6840
03:43:41,541 --> 03:43:43,410
THEN, A STORM CONCERN IN 

6841
03:43:43,410 --> 03:43:43,676
SAVANNAH. 

6842
03:43:43,676 --> 03:43:46,379
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RIVER IN 

6843
03:43:46,379 --> 03:43:53,953
SOUTH CAROLINA THAT FLOODED 

6844
03:43:53,953 --> 03:43:54,554
FROM HURRICANE FLORENCE. 

6845
03:43:54,554 --> 03:43:56,155
THE WAKAUMA RIVER NEVER GOT 

6846
03:43:56,155 --> 03:43:57,457
DOWN FROM FLOOD STAGE. 

6847
03:43:57,457 --> 03:44:00,960
PLENTY OF RIVERS IN THE 

6848
03:44:00,960 --> 03:44:01,895
COLUMBIA AREA AND FATEVILLE AND 

6849
03:44:01,895 --> 03:44:02,195
LUMBERTON. 

6850
03:44:02,195 --> 03:44:06,866
>> HOW MANY FOLKS ARE GETTING 

6851
03:44:06,866 --> 03:44:08,368
THIS KIND OF DOUBLE WHAMMY? 

6852
03:44:08,368 --> 03:44:11,905
>> IT'S PRETTY MUCH ANYONE IN 

6853
03:44:11,905 --> 03:44:13,039
CENTRAL, NORTHERN, AND NORTH 

6854
03:44:13,039 --> 03:44:15,041
AND SOUTH CAROLINA I SHOULD 

6855
03:44:15,041 --> 03:44:15,241
SAY. 

6856
03:44:15,241 --> 03:44:16,242
CHARLOTTE HAD THAT FLASH FLOOD 

6857
03:44:16,242 --> 03:44:16,442
BOUT. 

6858
03:44:16,442 --> 03:44:17,844
THEY DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH RIVER 

6859
03:44:17,844 --> 03:44:20,179
FLOODING BUT AGAIN, SO YOU'LL 

6860
03:44:20,179 --> 03:44:21,781
BE SEEING BOTH FLASH FLOOD 

6861
03:44:21,781 --> 03:44:23,950
CONCERN DURING THE DAY THURSDAY 

6862
03:44:23,950 --> 03:44:24,884
AND ADDITIONALLY, THAT RIVER 

6863
03:44:24,884 --> 03:44:26,085
FLOODING CONCERN THURSDAY INTO 

6864
03:44:26,085 --> 03:44:26,686
FRIDAY AS WELL. 

6865
03:44:26,686 --> 03:44:30,390
>> BOY, THOSE PEOPLE MUST BE SO 

6866
03:44:30,390 --> 03:44:31,891
TIRED OF IT RIGHT NOW. 

6867
03:44:31,891 --> 03:44:32,592
>> FOR SURE. 

6868
03:44:32,592 --> 03:44:34,093
AND AT THE COAST, CHARLESTON 

6869
03:44:34,093 --> 03:44:35,395
REALLY DODGED THE BULLET FROM 

6870
03:44:35,395 --> 03:44:35,862
FLORENCE. 

6871
03:44:35,862 --> 03:44:37,663
THEY WERE JUST OUTSIDE OF IT. 

6872
03:44:37,663 --> 03:44:39,566
BUT THEY'LL GET SOME STORM 

6873
03:44:39,566 --> 03:44:42,869
SURGE OUT OF THAT. 

6874
03:44:42,869 --> 03:44:43,770
A POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE 

6875
03:44:43,770 --> 03:44:44,037
FLOODING. 

6876
03:44:44,037 --> 03:44:45,838
YOU CAN SEE BETWEEN THE TWO 

6877
03:44:45,838 --> 03:44:47,073
STORMS, THE CAROLINAS I THINK 

6878
03:44:47,073 --> 03:44:48,875
HAVE HAD THEIR FILL OF THE 

6879
03:44:48,875 --> 03:44:50,176
TROPICS. 

6880
03:44:50,176 --> 03:44:52,511
>> AND TELL US DAVID. 

6881
03:44:52,511 --> 03:44:53,179
IS THIS IT? 

6882
03:44:53,179 --> 03:44:54,380
WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 

6883
03:44:54,380 --> 03:44:55,548
FLORENCE, WE THOUGHT THIS HAS 

6884
03:44:55,548 --> 03:44:57,684
TO BE THE END OF THE HURRICANE 

6885
03:44:57,684 --> 03:44:58,084
SEASON. 

6886
03:44:58,084 --> 03:44:58,650
NOW WE HAVE MICHAEL. 

6887
03:44:58,650 --> 03:45:01,821
THIS IS REALLY THE END RIGHT? 

6888
03:45:01,821 --> 03:45:04,490
>> FLORENCE HAPPENED AT THE 

6889
03:45:04,490 --> 03:45:05,491
LITERAL PEAK OF HURRICANE 

6890
03:45:05,491 --> 03:45:05,892
SEASON. 

6891
03:45:05,892 --> 03:45:06,392
THERE'S A SECOND HIGH. 

6892
03:45:06,392 --> 03:45:08,494
WE'RE A LITTLE AFTER THAT 

6893
03:45:08,494 --> 03:45:09,596
POINT. 

6894
03:45:09,596 --> 03:45:10,562
BUT HURRICANE SEASON RUNS INTO 

6895
03:45:10,562 --> 03:45:10,829
NOVEMBER. 

6896
03:45:10,829 --> 03:45:12,798
WE SHIFT INTO GULF OF MEXICO 

6897
03:45:12,798 --> 03:45:13,399
STORMS. 

6898
03:45:13,399 --> 03:45:15,401
YOU GET LESS OF THE RUNNERS OUT 

6899
03:45:15,401 --> 03:45:17,070
FROM THE MAIN DEVELOPMENT 

6900
03:45:17,070 --> 03:45:17,937
REGION IN THE CARIBBEAN. 

6901
03:45:17,937 --> 03:45:20,073
BUT REMEMBER, SANDY HAPPENED AT 

6902
03:45:20,073 --> 03:45:20,840
THE END OF OCTOBER. 

6903
03:45:20,840 --> 03:45:22,375
IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE TO GET 

6904
03:45:22,375 --> 03:45:22,575
THEM. 

6905
03:45:22,575 --> 03:45:25,879
THIS WILL CLEAR IT OUT FOR A 

6906
03:45:25,879 --> 03:45:26,179
LITTLE BIT. 

6907
03:45:26,179 --> 03:45:28,915
BUT, THERE WERE ALREADY SOME 

6908
03:45:28,915 --> 03:45:33,519
SIGNS AND MODELING WE COULD SEE 

6909
03:45:33,519 --> 03:45:34,988
THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. 

6910
03:45:34,988 --> 03:45:37,190
NO REASON TO LET YOUR GUARD 

6911
03:45:37,190 --> 03:45:37,690
DOWN. 

6912
03:45:37,690 --> 03:45:38,891
WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING THIS 

6913
03:45:38,891 --> 03:45:40,593
STRONG, I WOULD HOPE NOT. 

6914
03:45:40,593 --> 03:45:41,861
>> I HOPE THE CAROLINAS GET A 

6915
03:45:41,861 --> 03:45:43,296
BREAK AFTER THIS. 

6916
03:45:43,296 --> 03:45:45,999
>> I HOPE THE ENTIRE UNITED 

6917
03:45:45,999 --> 03:45:46,232
STATES. 

6918
03:45:46,232 --> 03:45:47,100
[ LAUGHTER ] 

6919
03:45:47,100 --> 03:45:47,400
>> INDEED. 

6920
03:45:47,400 --> 03:45:52,071
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

6921
03:45:52,071 --> 03:45:52,972
>> SURE THING. 

6922
03:45:52,972 --> 03:45:54,406
>>> AND, HILLARY LANE JOINS US 

6923
03:45:54,406 --> 03:46:01,781
NOW FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH 

6924
03:46:01,781 --> 03:46:02,048
FLORIDA. 

6925
03:46:02,048 --> 03:46:02,748
WHAT ARE YOU EXPERIENCING 

6926
03:46:02,748 --> 03:46:02,982
THERE? 

6927
03:46:02,982 --> 03:46:04,417
>> Reporter: A VERY DIFFERENT 

6928
03:46:04,417 --> 03:46:05,885
SIGHT COMPARED TO AN HOUR AGO. 

6929
03:46:05,885 --> 03:46:08,287
THE WORST OF THE STORM HAS 

6930
03:46:08,287 --> 03:46:08,688
PASSED US. 

6931
03:46:08,688 --> 03:46:10,990
LIGHT RAIN AND THE PALM TREES 

6932
03:46:10,990 --> 03:46:11,424
ARE BLOWING. 

6933
03:46:11,424 --> 03:46:13,192
BEFORE THAT AROUND NOON TODAY, 

6934
03:46:13,192 --> 03:46:15,395
THERE WAS WIND WHIPPING ACROSS, 

6935
03:46:15,395 --> 03:46:16,396
WE COULDN'T EVEN COME OUTSIDE 

6936
03:46:16,396 --> 03:46:17,730
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO 

6937
03:46:17,730 --> 03:46:18,030
DANGEROUS. 

6938
03:46:18,030 --> 03:46:19,699
IF YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THIS 

6939
03:46:19,699 --> 03:46:22,101
ROOF, YOU CAN SEE IT BLOWING IN 

6940
03:46:22,101 --> 03:46:25,004
THE WIND A LITTLE BIT. 

6941
03:46:25,004 --> 03:46:27,073
EARLIER TODAY, IT POPPED OFF A 

6942
03:46:27,073 --> 03:46:27,373
BIT. 

6943
03:46:27,373 --> 03:46:29,876
SO MANY SIGNS HANGING ON A 

6944
03:46:29,876 --> 03:46:30,143
DIAGONAL. 

6945
03:46:30,143 --> 03:46:32,511
EARLIER TODAY, IT WAS A VERY, 

6946
03:46:32,511 --> 03:46:33,345
VERY SCARY SCENE. 

6947
03:46:33,345 --> 03:46:37,216
AS IT PASSES THROUGH NOW, MUCH 

6948
03:46:37,216 --> 03:46:37,517
CALMER. 

6949
03:46:37,517 --> 03:46:40,385
>> IS THE AREA WHERE YOU ARE 

6950
03:46:40,385 --> 03:46:41,621
PRETTY MUCH FULLY EVACUATED? 

6951
03:46:41,621 --> 03:46:42,054
>> Reporter: YES. 

6952
03:46:42,054 --> 03:46:43,622
MUCH OF THE AREA, WE WERE AT A 

6953
03:46:43,622 --> 03:46:47,727
HOTEL LAST NIGHT IN A MANDATORY 

6954
03:46:47,727 --> 03:46:49,195
EVACUATION ZONE SO WE LEFT. 

6955
03:46:49,195 --> 03:46:52,464
BUT MANY PEOPLE THERE DIDN'T 

6956
03:46:52,464 --> 03:46:53,966
WANT TO LEAVE. 

6957
03:46:53,966 --> 03:46:55,200
THEY HAD DIFFERENT REASONS. 

6958
03:46:55,200 --> 03:46:56,402
SOME HAD ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS 

6959
03:46:56,402 --> 03:46:58,004
OR WANTED TO RIDE THE STORM 

6960
03:46:58,004 --> 03:46:58,204
OUT. 

6961
03:46:58,204 --> 03:47:01,674
SO MANY THOUGH THEY WERE IN THE 

6962
03:47:01,674 --> 03:47:05,078
MANDATORY EVACUATION AREAS 

6963
03:47:05,078 --> 03:47:05,812
DECIDED TO STAY. 

6964
03:47:05,812 --> 03:47:07,313
>> WHAT IS THE WORST OF WHAT 

6965
03:47:07,313 --> 03:47:09,115
YOU'VE SEEN NOW THAT THE STORM 

6966
03:47:09,115 --> 03:47:09,415
HAS PASSED? 

6967
03:47:09,415 --> 03:47:11,951
IS IT FLOODING PEOPLE HAVE TO 

6968
03:47:11,951 --> 03:47:12,819
DEAL WITH THERE? 

6969
03:47:12,819 --> 03:47:13,719
>> Reporter: I WOULD SAY THAT 

6970
03:47:13,719 --> 03:47:15,388
IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 

6971
03:47:15,388 --> 03:47:17,023
HAVE TO DO ESPECIALLY WHEN IT 

6972
03:47:17,023 --> 03:47:19,125
COMES TO TOMORROW WHEN PEOPLE 

6973
03:47:19,125 --> 03:47:20,693
GO OUTSIDE AND BEGIN TO 

6974
03:47:20,693 --> 03:47:20,960
REBUILD. 

6975
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:25,331
WE SEE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO 

6976
03:47:25,331 --> 03:47:25,631
STRUCTURES. 

6977
03:47:25,631 --> 03:47:31,504
WE HAVE SEEN SOME HOMES HAVE 

6978
03:47:31,504 --> 03:47:32,071
BEEN COMPLETELY LEVELED. 

6979
03:47:32,071 --> 03:47:33,606
SOME NEWER STRUCTURES SO WHEN 

6980
03:47:33,606 --> 03:47:34,874
PEOPLE COME BACK, THEY ARE 

6981
03:47:34,874 --> 03:47:37,410
COMING BACK TO QUITE A BIT THEY 

6982
03:47:37,410 --> 03:47:38,010
NEED TO REBUILD. 

6983
03:47:38,010 --> 03:47:41,214
>> HILLARY, WE HEAR THIS IS THE 

6984
03:47:41,214 --> 03:47:43,850
STRONGEST HURRICANE THAT HAS 

6985
03:47:43,850 --> 03:47:45,418
MADE LANDFALL IN THE FLORIDA 

6986
03:47:45,418 --> 03:47:45,751
PANHANDLE. 

6987
03:47:45,751 --> 03:47:47,954
WHAT ARE FOLKS THERE TELLING 

6988
03:47:47,954 --> 03:47:50,623
YOU ABOUT THIS? 

6989
03:47:50,623 --> 03:47:52,125
HAVE THEY JUST BEEN TERRIFIED 

6990
03:47:52,125 --> 03:47:53,759
THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE? 

6991
03:47:53,759 --> 03:47:55,528
>> Reporter: YEAH, THEY SAY 

6992
03:47:55,528 --> 03:47:56,328
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING. 

6993
03:47:56,328 --> 03:47:57,530
NOW THE INTERESTING PART PEOPLE 

6994
03:47:57,530 --> 03:47:59,532
ARE SAYING IS THEY DIDN'T HAVE 

6995
03:47:59,532 --> 03:48:00,299
TIME TO PREPARE. 

6996
03:48:00,299 --> 03:48:01,334
YOU KNOW WITH FLORENCE, 

6997
03:48:01,334 --> 03:48:02,001
PREDICTERS WERE SAYING THIS WAS 

6998
03:48:02,001 --> 03:48:04,570
GOING TO BE A STORM FOR A WEEK, 

6999
03:48:04,570 --> 03:48:05,638
BUT PEOPLE HERE DIDN'T REALLY 

7000
03:48:05,638 --> 03:48:07,707
KNOW ABOUT IT, IT FORMED SO 

7001
03:48:07,707 --> 03:48:07,974
QUICKLY. 

7002
03:48:07,974 --> 03:48:09,909
SO THEY WERE GETING THE 

7003
03:48:09,909 --> 03:48:11,210
MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDER THIS 

7004
03:48:11,210 --> 03:48:11,410
WEEK. 

7005
03:48:11,410 --> 03:48:12,745
SO, I THINK THE BIGGEST THING 

7006
03:48:12,745 --> 03:48:15,048
PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS FOR SUCH A 

7007
03:48:15,048 --> 03:48:15,948
POWERFUL GIGANTIC STORM, THEY 

7008
03:48:15,948 --> 03:48:20,252
DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO 

7009
03:48:20,252 --> 03:48:20,519
PREPARE. 

7010
03:48:20,519 --> 03:48:20,886
>> NO, INDEED. 

7011
03:48:20,886 --> 03:48:23,990
AND THAT IS WHAT MADE IT SO 

7012
03:48:23,990 --> 03:48:26,192
SCARY FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. 

7013
03:48:26,192 --> 03:48:27,860
IT CERTAINLY BUILT STRENGTH 

7014
03:48:27,860 --> 03:48:28,928
MORE QUICKLY THAN ANYONE COULD 

7015
03:48:28,928 --> 03:48:29,194
IMAGINE. 

7016
03:48:29,194 --> 03:48:30,463
HOW MANY HOMES DO YOU THINK 

7017
03:48:30,463 --> 03:48:31,497
THERE ARE WITHOUT POWER? 

7018
03:48:31,497 --> 03:48:35,968
ARE YOU SEEING A LOT OF POWER 

7019
03:48:35,968 --> 03:48:37,336
OUTAGES WHERE YOU ARE? 

7020
03:48:37,336 --> 03:48:38,905
>> WE ARE. 

7021
03:48:38,905 --> 03:48:42,608
WE'RE HEARING THERE WILL BE 

7022
03:48:42,608 --> 03:48:44,510
150,000 TO 200,000 PEOPLE 

7023
03:48:44,510 --> 03:48:45,011
WITHOUT POWER. 

7024
03:48:45,011 --> 03:48:47,980
WE LOST IT EARLIER BEFORE THE 

7025
03:48:47,980 --> 03:48:50,049
WORST OF THE STORM CAME 

7026
03:48:50,049 --> 03:48:50,316
THROUGH. 

7027
03:48:50,316 --> 03:48:51,384
WE HEARD FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR 

7028
03:48:51,384 --> 03:48:53,052
SAYING THAT THE NUMBER ONE 

7029
03:48:53,052 --> 03:48:54,554
PRIORITY IS TO GET THE 

7030
03:48:54,554 --> 03:48:55,154
ELECTRICITY BACK ON. 

7031
03:48:55,154 --> 03:48:57,557
IT'S CRUCIAL WHEN IT COMES TO 

7032
03:48:57,557 --> 03:48:57,824
BUILDING. 

7033
03:48:57,824 --> 03:48:59,458
SO, A LOT OF PEOPLE, UP TO 

7034
03:48:59,458 --> 03:49:01,193
200,000 PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT 

7035
03:49:01,193 --> 03:49:01,961
POWER. 

7036
03:49:01,961 --> 03:49:04,329
THAT WILL REALLY HINDER THE 

7037
03:49:04,329 --> 03:49:04,796
REBUILDING EFFORTS. 

7038
03:49:04,796 --> 03:49:07,867
>> HILLARY LANE, THANK YOU VERY 

7039
03:49:07,867 --> 03:49:08,334
MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE. 

7040
03:49:08,334 --> 03:49:08,634
STAY SAFE. 

7041
03:49:08,634 --> 03:49:09,969
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

7042
03:49:09,969 --> 03:49:11,337
BREAK, BUT BEFORE WE DO, WE 

7043

A.M. 

7063
03:51:41,287 --> 03:51:43,488
>> THE DOW FELL MORE THAN 800 

7064
03:51:43,488 --> 03:51:44,556
POINTS TODAY. 

7065
03:51:44,556 --> 03:51:47,526
ANALYSTS SAY INVESTORS ARE 

7066
03:51:47,526 --> 03:51:48,327
WORRIED ABOUT RISING INTEREST 

7067
03:51:48,327 --> 03:51:48,560
RATES. 

7068
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:50,896
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS 

7069
03:51:50,896 --> 03:51:52,631
DIPPED BELOW 26,000 IN A MONTH 

7070
03:51:52,631 --> 03:51:55,767
AND THE LOWEST SINCE APRIL. 

7071
03:51:55,767 --> 03:51:56,636
FOR MORE, YAHOO FINANCE 

7072
03:51:56,636 --> 03:51:58,003
REPORTER SCOTT JOINS ME ON THE 

7073
03:51:58,003 --> 03:51:58,236
PHONE. 

7074
03:51:58,236 --> 03:52:02,074
SCOTT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 

7075
03:52:02,074 --> 03:52:03,409
BEING WITH US. 

7076
03:52:03,409 --> 03:52:04,910
WHAT EXACTLY IS DRIVING THIS 

7077
03:52:04,910 --> 03:52:05,177
SELL-OFF? 

7078
03:52:05,177 --> 03:52:07,947
DO CHINA TARIFFS HAVE SOMETHING 

7079
03:52:07,947 --> 03:52:09,048
TO DO WITH IT? 

7080
03:52:09,048 --> 03:52:14,053
>> NO, I WOULD SAY THE INTEREST 

7081
03:52:14,053 --> 03:52:15,454
RATE WORRIES ARE THE MAIN 

7082
03:52:15,454 --> 03:52:15,721
CULPRIT. 

7083
03:52:15,721 --> 03:52:17,456
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN A FEAR 

7084
03:52:17,456 --> 03:52:18,858
MOST OF THE YEAR. 

7085
03:52:18,858 --> 03:52:20,760
INVESTORS HAVE BEEN EXPECTING 

7086
03:52:20,760 --> 03:52:22,762
YIELDS IN THE TEN YEAR TREASURY 

7087
03:52:22,762 --> 03:52:25,064
TO RISE AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE 

7088
03:52:25,064 --> 03:52:25,865
HIKES INTEREST RATES. 

7089
03:52:25,865 --> 03:52:27,767
THEY HIKED RATES THREE TIMES 

7090
03:52:27,767 --> 03:52:28,801
THIS YEAR, THEY'RE GEARING UP 

7091
03:52:28,801 --> 03:52:31,637
FOR A FOURTH ONE IN DECEMBER. 

7092
03:52:31,637 --> 03:52:32,271
ALTHOUGH WITH THE MARKET 

7093
03:52:32,271 --> 03:52:34,073
VOLATILITY THAT WE'RE SEEING 

7094
03:52:34,073 --> 03:52:37,410
RIGHT NOW, YOU'LL HAVE 

7095
03:52:37,410 --> 03:52:39,045
INVESTORS START TO WONDER IF 

7096
03:52:39,045 --> 03:52:40,980
THE FED CHAIRMAN WILL GO AHEAD 

7097
03:52:40,980 --> 03:52:41,781
WITH THAT DECEMBER HIKE. 

7098
03:52:41,781 --> 03:52:42,348
OBVIOUSLY TIME WILL TELL. 

7099
03:52:42,348 --> 03:52:44,083
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MONTHS 

7100
03:52:44,083 --> 03:52:44,850
UNTIL THAT POINT. 

7101
03:52:44,850 --> 03:52:46,685
>> AND SCOTT, YOU FOLLOW THE 

7102
03:52:46,685 --> 03:52:46,952
MARKETS. 

7103
03:52:46,952 --> 03:52:47,987
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. 

7104
03:52:47,987 --> 03:52:49,722
HOW MUCH DID THIS SELL-OFF 

7105
03:52:49,722 --> 03:52:50,089
SURPRISE YOU? 

7106
03:52:50,089 --> 03:52:50,989
IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. 

7107
03:52:50,989 --> 03:52:52,625
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE A 

7108
03:52:52,625 --> 03:52:53,726
SELL-OFF LIKE THIS, THERE TEND 

7109
03:52:53,726 --> 03:52:55,294
TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF BALANCE 

7110
03:52:55,294 --> 03:52:57,897
AT THE END OF THE DAY. 

7111
03:52:57,897 --> 03:52:59,364
BUYERS COMING IN FOR THE DEALS. 

7112
03:52:59,364 --> 03:53:00,465
WE DIDN'T SEE THAT TODAY. 

7113
03:53:00,465 --> 03:53:02,201
>> HERE AT YAHOO FINANCE, WE 

7114
03:53:02,201 --> 03:53:03,736
HAVE BEEN COVERING THE MARKET 

7115
03:53:03,736 --> 03:53:08,007
SELL-OFF ALL DAY AND THAT'S AN 

7116
03:53:08,007 --> 03:53:08,474
IMPORTANT POINT. 

7117
03:53:08,474 --> 03:53:10,009
WE DID NOT SEE ANY BUYER COME 

7118
03:53:10,009 --> 03:53:12,812
IN AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH 

7119
03:53:12,812 --> 03:53:14,447
THIS PANIC SELLING SO TO SPEAK. 

7120
03:53:14,447 --> 03:53:17,650
THE DOW WAS DOWN 500 POINTS IN 

7121
03:53:17,650 --> 03:53:20,920
THE EARLY AFTERNOON. 

7122
03:53:20,920 --> 03:53:22,054
AND AS THAT 3:30 LEVEL 

7123
03:53:22,054 --> 03:53:23,689
APPROACHED, 3:30 P.M., INTO THE 

7124
03:53:23,689 --> 03:53:23,955
4:00 P.M. 

7125
03:53:23,955 --> 03:53:26,625
CLOSE, THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW SOME 

7126
03:53:26,625 --> 03:53:32,231
OF THE BIGGEST DECLINES IN THE 

7127
03:53:32,231 --> 03:53:32,531
DOW TODAY. 

7128
03:53:32,531 --> 03:53:35,935
LEADING 831 POINTS. 

7129
03:53:35,935 --> 03:53:39,505
DECLINE, WHAT IS INTERESTING IS 

7130
03:53:39,505 --> 03:53:40,406
YIELDS ON THE TREASURE YIELDS, 

7131
03:53:40,406 --> 03:53:42,908
THEY FELL AT THE VERY END OF 

7132
03:53:42,908 --> 03:53:43,241
THE SESSION. 

7133
03:53:43,241 --> 03:53:44,310
MEANING THAT INVESTORS TOOK 

7134
03:53:44,310 --> 03:53:47,646
MONEY OUT OF STOCKS AS WE KNOW. 

7135
03:53:47,646 --> 03:53:52,918
BUT, ACTUALLY PUT THEM INTO 

7136
03:53:52,918 --> 03:53:53,252
BONDS. 

7137
03:53:53,252 --> 03:53:56,088
THE SAFE HAVEN PLACE. 

7138
03:53:56,088 --> 03:53:56,856
INVESTORS HAD BEEN BUYING 

7139
03:53:56,856 --> 03:53:57,089
BONDS. 

7140
03:53:57,089 --> 03:53:59,358
>> SO NOBODY IS JUST SITTING ON 

7141
03:53:59,358 --> 03:54:01,360
THEIR CASH OR PUTTING IT INTO 

7142
03:54:01,360 --> 03:54:01,860
GOLD JUST YET. 

7143
03:54:01,860 --> 03:54:02,228
>> YEAH. 

7144
03:54:02,228 --> 03:54:04,129
I THINK YOU HAVE PLENTY OF 

7145
03:54:04,129 --> 03:54:10,102
INVESTORS KIND OF SITTING ON 

7146
03:54:10,102 --> 03:54:11,937
THEIR HAPPENS GOING INTO CASH. 

7147
03:54:11,937 --> 03:54:17,109
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT 

7148
03:54:17,109 --> 03:54:20,579
THE S&P 500 IS STILL UP 4% FOR 

7149
03:54:20,579 --> 03:54:26,085
THE YEAR AND WE COULD END UP 

7150
03:54:26,085 --> 03:54:27,920
WELL BEYOND THAT LEVEL. 

7151
03:54:27,920 --> 03:54:28,854
WE ARE AT 2785. 

7152
03:54:28,854 --> 03:54:32,892
AND, THE OTHER THING TO 

7153
03:54:32,892 --> 03:54:33,826
REMEMBER IS OCTOBER IS 

7154
03:54:33,826 --> 03:54:36,262
TYPICALLY A VOLATILE MONTH FOR 

7155
03:54:36,262 --> 03:54:36,895
THE MARKET. 

7156
03:54:36,895 --> 03:54:38,197
YOU GO BACK HISTORICALLY, WE'VE 

7157
03:54:38,197 --> 03:54:39,064
HAD MANY CORRECTIONS THROUGHOUT 

7158
03:54:39,064 --> 03:54:41,534
THE YEARS DURING THE MONTH OF 

7159
03:54:41,534 --> 03:54:41,800
OCTOBER. 

7160
03:54:41,800 --> 03:54:44,036
>> SO, SCOTT, HOW CONCERNED DO 

7161
03:54:44,036 --> 03:54:46,639
YOU THINK INVESTORS SHOULD BE 

7162
03:54:46,639 --> 03:54:48,006
OR SHOULD THEY WAKE UP TOMORROW 

7163
03:54:48,006 --> 03:54:50,409
MORNING AND START BUYING UP THE 

7164
03:54:50,409 --> 03:54:50,642
DEALS? 

7165
03:54:50,642 --> 03:54:51,610
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK IT'S 

7166
03:54:51,610 --> 03:54:54,647
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT HOW SOME 

7167
03:54:54,647 --> 03:54:56,549
OF THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS 

7168
03:54:56,549 --> 03:54:57,149
PERFORMED OVERNIGHT. 

7169
03:54:57,149 --> 03:54:59,251
AND, WE'LL KIND OF REASSESS IN 

7170
03:54:59,251 --> 03:54:59,618
THE MORNING. 

7171
03:54:59,618 --> 03:55:02,454
SEE WHERE FUTURES ARE. 

7172
03:55:02,454 --> 03:55:03,622
SEE WHERE EUROPE IS. 

7173
03:55:03,622 --> 03:55:05,991
SEE WHERE ASIA IS. 

7174
03:55:05,991 --> 03:55:07,860
BUT I WOULD EXPECT ADDITIONAL 

7175
03:55:07,860 --> 03:55:08,661
VOLATILITY INTO TOMORROW JUST 

7176
03:55:08,661 --> 03:55:09,928
GIVEN HOW WE DIDN'T SEE ANY 

7177
03:55:09,928 --> 03:55:14,867
BUYERS COME IN AT THE END OF 

7178
03:55:14,867 --> 03:55:16,268
THE TRADING SESSION TODAY. 

7179
03:55:16,268 --> 03:55:19,538
THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS 

7180
03:55:19,538 --> 03:55:23,842
THAT INVESTORS ARE CONSTANTLY 

7181
03:55:23,842 --> 03:55:24,710
TRYING TO REMAIN DIVERSIFIED. 

7182
03:55:24,710 --> 03:55:26,178
SO, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON 

7183
03:55:26,178 --> 03:55:27,379
WITH INTEREST RATES AND YOU 

7184
03:55:27,379 --> 03:55:28,881
HAVE TO WONDER WHAT DO INTEREST 

7185
03:55:28,881 --> 03:55:32,318
RATES HAVE TO DO WITH THE PRICE 

7186
03:55:32,318 --> 03:55:38,057
TO EARNINGS MULTIPLE OF SAY 

7187
03:55:38,057 --> 03:55:38,757
PROCTOR AND GAMBLE. 

7188
03:55:38,757 --> 03:55:39,558
STOCKS THAT WILL DO WELL 

7189
03:55:39,558 --> 03:55:42,194
REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON 

7190
03:55:42,194 --> 03:55:43,829
IN THE MARKET. 

7191
03:55:43,829 --> 03:55:46,265
WE'LL KEEP BUYING OUR MEDICINE, 

7192
03:55:46,265 --> 03:55:48,200
TOOTH PASTE, STAPLE ITEMS. 

7193
03:55:48,200 --> 03:55:50,469
SO WE'LL START TO SEE SOME OF 

7194
03:55:50,469 --> 03:55:53,339
THOSE DEFENSIVE PLAYS IN THE 

7195
03:55:53,339 --> 03:55:53,905
MARKET CREEP UP. 

7196
03:55:53,905 --> 03:55:55,073
>> ALL RIGHT SCOTT. 

7197
03:55:55,073 --> 03:55:55,774
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT. 

7198
03:55:55,774 --> 03:55:59,612
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH TANYA. 

7199
03:55:59,612 --> 03:56:05,884
>>> LET'S TURN BACK YOU TO 

7200
03:56:05,884 --> 03:56:09,088
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

7201
03:56:09,088 --> 03:56:10,188
CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTING 

7202
03:56:10,188 --> 03:56:13,392
METEOROLOGIST JEFF IS HERE. 

7203
03:56:13,392 --> 03:56:22,201
>> THE STORM HAD WINDS OF 1 155 

7204
03:56:22,201 --> 03:56:24,770
MILES WHEN IT CAME ASHORE. 

7205
03:56:24,770 --> 03:56:26,338
THERE WAS 10 TO 12 FEET OF 

7206
03:56:26,338 --> 03:56:27,339
STORM SURGE. 

7207
03:56:27,339 --> 03:56:28,673
SOME PLACES I BET WILL CONFIRM 

7208
03:56:28,673 --> 03:56:35,281
15 PLUS FEET OF STORM SURGE. 

7209
03:56:35,281 --> 03:56:35,848
ENBELIEVABLE VIDEO THERE. 

7210
03:56:35,848 --> 03:56:37,082
MEXICO BEACH WAS RIGHT IN THE 

7211
03:56:37,082 --> 03:56:38,083
CENTER OF THE STORM. 

7212
03:56:38,083 --> 03:56:39,952
THAT MEANS THEY SAW THE 

7213
03:56:39,952 --> 03:56:40,452
STRONGEST OF WINDS. 

7214
03:56:40,452 --> 03:56:45,691
I SAW A WIND GUST REPORT AT THE 

7215
03:56:45,691 --> 03:56:46,725
AIR FORCE BASE OF 129 MILES AN 

7216
03:56:46,725 --> 03:56:47,293
HOUR. 

7217
03:56:47,293 --> 03:56:48,794
ONCE YOU GET PAST THAT POINT, 

7218
03:56:48,794 --> 03:56:52,631
THE SENSORS FAIL IF THERE ARE 

7219
03:56:52,631 --> 03:56:53,799
SENSORS IN THE PART OF THE 

7220
03:56:53,799 --> 03:56:54,032
STORM. 

7221
03:56:54,032 --> 03:56:58,070
THIS IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST 

7222
03:56:58,070 --> 03:56:59,672
STORMS WE HAVE SEEN STRIKE THE 

7223
03:56:59,672 --> 03:57:00,039
UNITED STATES. 

7224
03:57:00,039 --> 03:57:02,074
>> YOU LOOK AT THESE IMAGES AND 

7225
03:57:02,074 --> 03:57:03,942
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE 

7226
03:57:03,942 --> 03:57:04,209
FLOODING. 

7227
03:57:04,209 --> 03:57:07,780
YOU CAN SEE WHOLE STRUCTURES 

7228
03:57:07,780 --> 03:57:08,480
ARE DEMOLISHED. 

7229
03:57:08,480 --> 03:57:09,682
ROOFS HAVE BEEN BLOWN OFF. 

7230
03:57:09,682 --> 03:57:14,086
>> IT LOOKS LIKE THE DAMAGE 

7231
03:57:14,086 --> 03:57:15,387
AFTER A TSUNAMI. 

7232
03:57:15,387 --> 03:57:15,620
RIGHT? 

7233
03:57:15,620 --> 03:57:16,088
>> YES IT DOES. 

7234
03:57:16,088 --> 03:57:17,189
THIS IS STORM SURGE THAT WILL 

7235
03:57:17,189 --> 03:57:19,258
GO DOWN BY THE END OF THE DAY? 

7236
03:57:19,258 --> 03:57:22,161
>> YES, SOME TIME LATER THIS 

7237
03:57:22,161 --> 03:57:23,862
EVENING. 

7238
03:57:23,862 --> 03:57:26,298
THE NEXT HIGH TIDE CYCLE IS 

7239
03:57:26,298 --> 03:57:26,799
THIS EVENING. 

7240
03:57:26,799 --> 03:57:28,867
ONCE THAT GOES DOWN, THE WATER 

7241
03:57:28,867 --> 03:57:29,501
WILL GO OUT. 

7242
03:57:29,501 --> 03:57:30,235
IT'S PROBABLY GETTING SLIGHTLY 

7243
03:57:30,235 --> 03:57:32,571
BETTER BUT IT WON'T BE 

7244
03:57:32,571 --> 03:57:37,176
COMPLETELY GONE UNTIL TOMORROW 

7245
03:57:37,176 --> 03:57:37,443
MORNING. 

7246
03:57:37,443 --> 03:57:39,210
>> THESE DEADLY PROJECTILES. 

7247
03:57:39,210 --> 03:57:39,911
ANYTHING THAT ISN'T COMPLETELY 

7248
03:57:39,911 --> 03:57:43,782
BATTENED DOWN AS YOU WOULD ON A 

7249
03:57:43,782 --> 03:57:44,083
SHIP. 

7250
03:57:44,083 --> 03:57:44,516
IT'S JUST DEADLY. 

7251
03:57:44,516 --> 03:57:46,085
>> IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT 

7252
03:57:46,085 --> 03:57:49,688
AS THE WINDS GO UP, THE FORCE 

7253
03:57:49,688 --> 03:57:50,288
GOES UP EXPONENTIALLY. 

7254
03:57:50,288 --> 03:57:51,790
IT'S NOT LIKE IF YOU HAVE A 

7255
03:57:51,790 --> 03:57:54,059
STORM OF 75 MILES AN HOUR 

7256
03:57:54,059 --> 03:57:54,693
MAGNITUDE AND A STORM OF 150 

7257
03:57:54,693 --> 03:57:58,097
MILES AN HOUR THAT THE STORM OF 

7258
03:57:58,097 --> 03:58:00,832
150 IS TWICE AS STRONG. 

7259
03:58:00,832 --> 03:58:01,099
IT'S NOT. 

7260
03:58:01,099 --> 03:58:01,700
IT'S EXPONENTIALLY STRONGER. 

7261
03:58:01,700 --> 03:58:03,102
THE AMOUNT OF FORCE AND THE 

7262
03:58:03,102 --> 03:58:06,538
AMOUNT OF DAMAGE IT CAUSES IS 

7263
03:58:06,538 --> 03:58:07,506
EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER. 

7264
03:58:07,506 --> 03:58:09,608
>> THE IMAGES WE ARE SEEING OUT 

7265
03:58:09,608 --> 03:58:13,412
OF MEXICO CITY ARE BECAUSE 

7266
03:58:13,412 --> 03:58:14,212
PEOPLE WERE SAFE ON HIGH 

7267
03:58:14,212 --> 03:58:14,513
FLOORS. 

7268
03:58:14,513 --> 03:58:14,746
>> YES. 

7269
03:58:14,746 --> 03:58:17,683
AND YOU LOOK AT THE DESTRUCTION 

7270
03:58:17,683 --> 03:58:18,550
ON THE GROUND. 

7271
03:58:18,550 --> 03:58:20,185
AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THOSE 

7272
03:58:20,185 --> 03:58:21,119
PEOPLE GOT OUT IN TIME. 

7273
03:58:21,119 --> 03:58:22,420
>> YOU HAVE TO HOPE. 

7274
03:58:22,420 --> 03:58:23,088
YOU HAVE TO PRAY. 

7275
03:58:23,088 --> 03:58:24,890
AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN 

7276
03:58:24,890 --> 03:58:25,991
THE HIGHER BUILDINGS, THEY'RE 

7277
03:58:25,991 --> 03:58:28,427
NOT GOING TO BE STUCK THERE YOU 

7278
03:58:28,427 --> 03:58:29,795
SAY BECAUSE THE WATER WILL 

7279
03:58:29,795 --> 03:58:30,829
EVENTUALLY PULL BACK OUT TO 

7280
03:58:30,829 --> 03:58:31,029
SEA. 

7281
03:58:31,029 --> 03:58:32,698
>> SO, FOR ANYBODY IN THE PATH 

7282
03:58:32,698 --> 03:58:34,400
OF THE WORST OF THE DAMAGE, 

7283
03:58:34,400 --> 03:58:36,301
REALLY ANYWHERE NEAR THE 

7284
03:58:36,301 --> 03:58:37,302
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS, AND 

7285
03:58:37,302 --> 03:58:38,671
BEYOND THAT TO BE HONEST WITH 

7286
03:58:38,671 --> 03:58:41,874
YOU, THERE WILL BE POWER LINES 

7287
03:58:41,874 --> 03:58:42,274
DOWN, TREES DOWN. 

7288
03:58:42,274 --> 03:58:45,477
PLACES YOU CANNOT PASS THROUGH 

7289
03:58:45,477 --> 03:58:46,145
THE ROADWAYS. 

7290
03:58:46,145 --> 03:58:48,313
DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE OR 

7291
03:58:48,313 --> 03:58:49,380
BUILDING AND GO VERY FAR 

7292
03:58:49,380 --> 03:58:51,617
WITHOUT THE AUTHORITIES SAYING 

7293
03:58:51,617 --> 03:58:51,917
IT'S SAFE. 

7294
03:58:51,917 --> 03:58:53,018
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE 

7295
03:58:53,018 --> 03:58:54,052
ELECTROCUTED BY FALLING POWER 

7296
03:58:54,052 --> 03:58:54,285
LINES. 

7297
03:58:54,285 --> 03:58:55,821
>> WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE 

7298
03:58:55,821 --> 03:58:56,054
POWER? 

7299
03:58:56,054 --> 03:58:59,992
WE HEARD OVER A QUARTER OF A 

7300
03:58:59,992 --> 03:59:01,026
PEOPLE ARE NOW WITHOUT POWER. 

7301
03:59:01,026 --> 03:59:02,027
>> TRADITIONAL AFTER THESE 

7302
03:59:02,027 --> 03:59:03,862
STORMS IT TAKES TWO TO THREE 

7303
03:59:03,862 --> 03:59:06,198
WEEKS TO RESTORE POWER TO 

7304
03:59:06,198 --> 03:59:06,498
EVERYBODY. 

7305
03:59:06,498 --> 03:59:08,033
I'VE SEEN IT MYSELF. 

7306
03:59:08,033 --> 03:59:09,134
LIVED IN FLORIDA 15 YEARS. 

7307
03:59:09,134 --> 03:59:12,070
SEEN A LOT OF HURRICANES. 

7308
03:59:12,070 --> 03:59:13,104
SOME PEOPLE GET THEIR POWER 

7309
03:59:13,104 --> 03:59:17,876
BACK IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. 

7310
03:59:17,876 --> 03:59:19,744
OTHERS MIGHT TAKE TWO WEEKS 

7311
03:59:19,744 --> 03:59:19,944
AGO. 

7312
03:59:19,944 --> 03:59:21,914
>> DOESN'T EVERYBODY IN FLORIDA 

7313
03:59:21,914 --> 03:59:23,248
HAVE A BACKUP GENERATOR? 

7314
03:59:23,248 --> 03:59:23,915
>> IT'S NOT TRUE. 

7315
03:59:23,915 --> 03:59:24,650
IT'S HARD. 

7316
03:59:24,650 --> 03:59:27,519
FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE ONLY SO 

7317
03:59:27,519 --> 03:59:28,320
MANY BACKUP GENERATORS TO BE 

7318
03:59:28,320 --> 03:59:29,621
HAD AND THEY COST A LOT OF 

7319
03:59:29,621 --> 03:59:31,623
MONEY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T 

7320
03:59:31,623 --> 03:59:33,125
HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY THEM. 

7321
03:59:33,125 --> 03:59:33,492
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

7322
03:59:33,492 --> 03:59:35,327
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF 

7323
03:59:35,327 --> 03:59:36,328
THESE IMAGES HERE. 

7324
03:59:36,328 --> 03:59:36,928
THIS IS JUST INCREDIBLE. 

7325
03:59:36,928 --> 03:59:41,033
THIS IS LIVE FROM PANAMA CITY 

7326
03:59:41,033 --> 03:59:41,266
BEACH. 

7327
03:59:41,266 --> 03:59:41,733
ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION. 

7328
03:59:41,733 --> 03:59:42,167
TREES KNOCKED DOWN. 

7329
03:59:42,167 --> 03:59:45,103
>>YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY WERE 

7330
03:59:45,103 --> 03:59:46,071
TWISTED AND TURNED. 

7331
03:59:46,071 --> 03:59:47,406
THE TREES WEREN'T KNOCKED OVER, 

7332
03:59:47,406 --> 03:59:49,107
THEY WERE TWISTED AND TURNED 

7333
03:59:49,107 --> 03:59:49,408
AROUND. 

7334
03:59:49,408 --> 03:59:50,074
>> OH MY GOODNESS. 

7335
03:59:50,074 --> 03:59:52,377
THE STRENGTH OF THOSE WINDS IS 

7336
03:59:52,377 --> 03:59:53,979
UNIMAGINABLE. 

7337
03:59:53,979 --> 03:59:57,950
>> AND IF YOU LOOK, THE EERIEST 

7338
03:59:57,950 --> 04:00:00,853
SIGHT IS NO LEAVES ON THE 

7339
04:00:00,853 --> 04:00:01,253
TREES. 

7340
04:00:01,253 --> 04:00:02,821
BECAUSE IT STRIPS THE TREES OF 

7341
04:00:02,821 --> 04:00:04,523
LEAVES SO IT'S VERY EERIE AND 

7342
04:00:04,523 --> 04:00:06,225
SUBLIMINAL WHEN YOU WALK INTO A 

7343
04:00:06,225 --> 04:00:06,725
SCENE LIKE THAT. 

7344
04:00:06,725 --> 04:00:08,227
YOU LOOK AT IT AND SAY 

7345
04:00:08,227 --> 04:00:09,928
SOMETHING DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT 

7346
04:00:09,928 --> 04:00:10,729
BEYOND ALL THE DESTRUCTION. 

7347
04:00:10,729 --> 04:00:12,231
IT'S BECAUSE ALL THE LEAVES ARE 

7348
04:00:12,231 --> 04:00:12,431
GONE. 

7349
04:00:12,431 --> 04:00:14,098
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT. 

7350
04:00:14,098 --> 04:00:17,069
I THOUGHT WOW, THAT DOES LOOK 

7351
04:00:17,069 --> 04:00:17,970
SORT OF APOCALYPTIC. 

7352
04:00:17,970 --> 04:00:19,705
THAT'S THE REASON. 

7353
04:00:19,705 --> 04:00:22,841
>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER 

7354
04:00:22,841 --> 04:00:23,108
TODAY. 

7355
04:00:23,108 --> 04:00:25,510
THIS IS LIKE THE DAMAGE OF THE 

7356
04:00:25,510 --> 04:00:26,945
MOORE OKLAHOMA TORNADO. 

7357
04:00:26,945 --> 04:00:28,713
THIS REALLY MIMICKED A BIG 

7358
04:00:28,713 --> 04:00:28,980
TORNADO. 

7359
04:00:28,980 --> 04:00:29,614
A BUZZ SAW TORNADO. 

7360
04:00:29,614 --> 04:00:32,551
>> THAT'S STILL A DANGER HERE? 

7361
04:00:32,551 --> 04:00:34,119
ARE WE EXPECTING TORNADOES NOW? 

7362
04:00:34,119 --> 04:00:34,486
>> DEFINITELY. 

7363
04:00:34,486 --> 04:00:35,454
WE HAVE PROBABLY SEEN A NUMBER 

7364
04:00:35,454 --> 04:00:36,655
OF TORNADOES AND THERE HAVE 

7365
04:00:36,655 --> 04:00:37,155
BEEN SOME. 

7366
04:00:37,155 --> 04:00:39,458
BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL THE 

7367
04:00:39,458 --> 04:00:40,359
DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY IN GROUND 

7368
04:00:40,359 --> 04:00:42,661
ZERO FOR THE STORM OF WHAT WAS 

7369
04:00:42,661 --> 04:00:44,062
THE TORNADO DAMAGE AND WHAT 

7370
04:00:44,062 --> 04:00:44,295
WASN'T. 

7371
04:00:44,295 --> 04:00:46,365
BUT AS THE STORM CONTINUES TO 

7372
04:00:46,365 --> 04:00:48,166
MOVE NORTH OVER I-10 NOW. 

7373
04:00:48,166 --> 04:00:49,768
ACROSS THE GEORGIA FLORIDA 

7374
04:00:49,768 --> 04:00:51,236
LINE, AS IT MOVES NORTH, IT'S 

7375
04:00:51,236 --> 04:00:53,005
GOING TO PRODUCE PROBABLY MORE 

7376
04:00:53,005 --> 04:00:53,838
TORNADOES THAN IT HAS. 

7377
04:00:53,838 --> 04:00:56,174
AS IT STARTS TO UNRAVEL A 

7378
04:00:56,174 --> 04:00:57,809
LITTLE BIT, YOU SEE THE OUTER 

7379
04:00:57,809 --> 04:00:59,611
BANDS BEGIN TO SPIN JUST A 

7380
04:00:59,611 --> 04:01:00,946
LITTLE BIT MORE IN SOME CASES 

7381
04:01:00,946 --> 04:01:02,781
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE 

7382
04:01:02,781 --> 04:01:03,949
MORE TORNADOES. 

7383
04:01:03,949 --> 04:01:05,851
SO, FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, 

7384
04:01:05,851 --> 04:01:06,685
TORNADOES WILL BE A BIG THREAT. 

7385
04:01:06,685 --> 04:01:09,054
THE BIGGEST THREAT WILL BE THE 

7386
04:01:09,054 --> 04:01:10,589
FLOODING RAIN IN GEORGIA, AND 

7387
04:01:10,589 --> 04:01:11,356
THE CAROLINAS AS WELL. 

7388
04:01:11,356 --> 04:01:12,958
IT WILL BE BETH FLASH FLOODING 

7389
04:01:12,958 --> 04:01:14,560
AND ALSO RIVER FLOODING AS 

7390
04:01:14,560 --> 04:01:14,960
WELL. 

7391
04:01:14,960 --> 04:01:16,395
I WAS CHECKING THE LATEST STATS 

7392
04:01:16,395 --> 04:01:17,763
ON SOME OF THE RIVERS IN SOUTH 

7393
04:01:17,763 --> 04:01:18,230
AND NORTH CAROLINA. 

7394
04:01:18,230 --> 04:01:20,666
A LOT OF THEM WERE CLOSE TO, 

7395
04:01:20,666 --> 04:01:22,734
YOU KNOW, NORMAL OR AT LEAST 

7396
04:01:22,734 --> 04:01:23,401
NOT IN FLOOD STAGE, BUT THERE 

7397
04:01:23,401 --> 04:01:25,737
WERE A FEW OF THEM IN FLOOD 

7398
04:01:25,737 --> 04:01:27,439
STAGE HEADED BACK TO AT LEAST 

7399
04:01:27,439 --> 04:01:29,608
MODERATE AND IN SOME CASES 

7400
04:01:29,608 --> 04:01:30,141
MAJOR FLOOD STAGE. 

7401
04:01:30,141 --> 04:01:32,344
>> THE LAST THING PEOPLE NEED. 

7402
04:01:32,344 --> 04:01:32,844
JEFF, THANK YOU. 

7403
04:01:32,844 --> 04:01:34,379
WE HOPE EVERYONE IN FLORIDA IS 

7404
04:01:34,379 --> 04:01:34,579
SAFE. 

7405
04:01:34,579 --> 04:01:36,081
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

7406
04:01:36,081 --> 04:01:36,348
BREAK. 

7407
04:01:36,348 --> 04:01:41,553
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MUCH MORE 

7408
04:01:41,553 --> 04:01:41,753
CBSN. 

7409
04:01:41,753 --> 04:01:42,020
DON'T GO AWAY. 

7410
04:03:46,911 --> 04:03:51,350
>> WE WANT TO TURN TO OUR 

7411
04:03:51,350 --> 04:03:52,884
TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE WTCE FOR 

7412
04:03:52,884 --> 04:03:53,852
MORE COVERAGE ON THE STORM. 

7413
04:03:53,852 --> 04:03:55,320
>> YOU COULD SEE WIND GUSTS IN 

7414
04:03:55,320 --> 04:03:57,823
EXCESS OF 75 MILES AN HOUR. 

7415
04:03:57,823 --> 04:04:00,926
THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY CAUSE MORE 

7416
04:04:00,926 --> 04:04:06,198
POWER OUTAGES FOR THOSE OF YOU 

7417
04:04:06,198 --> 04:04:07,065
WHO HAVE POWER. 

7418
04:04:07,065 --> 04:04:09,534
THERE WILL BE WINDY CONDITIONS 

7419
04:04:09,534 --> 04:04:10,202
AND RAIN HERE. 

7420
04:04:10,202 --> 04:04:11,336
MORE BREAKS STARTING TO FORM. 

7421
04:04:11,336 --> 04:04:13,405
YOU MAY NO HAVE THE SUSTAINED 

7422
04:04:13,405 --> 04:04:14,473
WINDS LASTING AS LONG, BUT FOR 

7423
04:04:14,473 --> 04:04:21,146
THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO, FAIRLY 

7424
04:04:21,146 --> 04:04:23,715
WIDESPREAD SUSTAINED WINDS 30 

7425
04:04:23,715 --> 04:04:25,317
TO 40 MILES AN HOUR RANGE. 

7426
04:04:25,317 --> 04:04:27,919
THE WINDS ARE GETTING A LITTLE 

7427
04:04:27,919 --> 04:04:28,920
BIT LIGHTER TOO. 

7428
04:04:28,920 --> 04:04:29,887
THE WATER HAS BEEN PILING UP. 

7429
04:04:29,887 --> 04:04:32,224
WE STILL HAVE THE ON SHORE FLOW 

7430
04:04:32,224 --> 04:04:33,157
KEEPING THE STORM SURGE MACHINE 

7431
04:04:33,157 --> 04:04:33,391
GOING. 

7432
04:04:33,391 --> 04:04:35,727
FOR AT LEAST A FEW MORE HOURS. 

7433
04:04:35,727 --> 04:04:36,528
THEN THE RAINFALL WILL 

7434
04:04:36,528 --> 04:04:38,029
GRADUALLY START TO COME APART 

7435
04:04:38,029 --> 04:04:38,229
TOO. 

7436
04:04:38,229 --> 04:04:39,831
NOW, IF WE COULD SWITCH OVER TO 

7437
04:04:39,831 --> 04:04:41,900
MAX 2, I WILL GO AHEAD AND TALK 

7438
04:04:41,900 --> 04:04:47,005
ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS GOING 

7439
04:04:47,005 --> 04:04:47,172
ON. 

7440
04:04:47,172 --> 04:04:48,173
SATELLITE VIEW, THIS IMAGERY, 

7441
04:04:48,173 --> 04:04:50,509
WE'RE STILL GETTING AND YOU CAN 

7442
04:04:50,509 --> 04:04:52,778
SEE. 

7443
04:04:52,778 --> 04:04:55,413
HAS IT MADE LANDFALL NEAR 

7444
04:04:55,413 --> 04:04:56,014
MEXICO BEACH? 

7445
04:04:56,014 --> 04:05:02,154
IT MOVED  THROUGH CALHOUN 

7446
04:05:02,154 --> 04:05:02,387
COUNTY. 

7447
04:05:02,387 --> 04:05:03,822
THIS TAKES THE STRONG WINDS 

7448
04:05:03,822 --> 04:05:05,991
RIGHT THROUGH MILLER COUNTY AND 

7449
04:05:05,991 --> 04:05:08,059
EARLY COUNTY AND BAKER AND 

7450
04:05:08,059 --> 04:05:08,359
DAUGHTERTY. 

7451
04:05:08,359 --> 04:05:09,928
SO, IF YOU ARE ALONG AND WEST 

7452
04:05:09,928 --> 04:05:12,330
OF THE FLINT RIVER, THAT'S 

7453
04:05:12,330 --> 04:05:14,366
PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD BOUNDARY 

7454
04:05:14,366 --> 04:05:15,734
FOR THE STRONGEST WINDS NEAR 

7455
04:05:15,734 --> 04:05:16,234
THAT EYE WALL. 

7456
04:05:16,234 --> 04:05:19,204
AS YOU GO JUST A LITTLE FURTHER 

7457
04:05:19,204 --> 04:05:20,272
EAST, THE WINDS WILL DECREASE. 

7458
04:05:20,272 --> 04:05:23,709
BUT, THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO 

7459
04:05:23,709 --> 04:05:24,142
SUDDENLY DECREASE. 

7460
04:05:24,142 --> 04:05:26,111
THEY WILL BE QUITE STRONG 

7461
04:05:26,111 --> 04:05:27,211
ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHWEST 

7462
04:05:27,211 --> 04:05:27,478
GEORGIA. 

7463
04:05:27,478 --> 04:05:29,748
ONE THING ROB AN I WERE JUST 

7464
04:05:29,748 --> 04:05:31,349
TALKING ABOUT IS THIS LAST 

7465
04:05:31,349 --> 04:05:32,951
LITTLE BIT OF CONVECTION THAT 

7466
04:05:32,951 --> 04:05:34,686
DEVELOPED PRETTY FAR REMOVED 

7467
04:05:34,686 --> 04:05:36,855
FROM THE CENTER DOWN TOWARD THE 

7468
04:05:36,855 --> 04:05:37,155
SOUTHEAST. 

7469
04:05:37,155 --> 04:05:38,857
THAT IS STILL ROLLING UP SOME 

7470
04:05:38,857 --> 04:05:41,459
VERY STRONG WINDS AT LEAST THE 

7471
04:05:41,459 --> 04:05:43,762
MID AND UPPER LEVELS ACROSS 

7472
04:05:43,762 --> 04:05:46,198
LIBERTY AND LEON COUNTIES. 

7473
04:05:46,198 --> 04:05:47,465
AS THAT ROTATES UP AND AROUND, 

7474
04:05:47,465 --> 04:05:48,967
THAT COULD PRODUCE SOME 

7475
04:05:48,967 --> 04:05:49,868
DAMAGING WIND GUSTS. 

7476
04:05:49,868 --> 04:05:53,505
SO, THE WINDS MAY BE GETTINGER 

7477
04:05:53,505 --> 04:05:54,205
IN SPOTS BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY 

7478
04:05:54,205 --> 04:05:56,708
NOT SAFE AND THIS WILL CAUSE A 

7479
04:05:56,708 --> 04:05:57,275
FEW MORE POWER OUTAGES. 

7480
04:05:57,275 --> 04:06:01,446
THE DRIER AIR IS THE STUFF OUT 

7481
04:06:01,446 --> 04:06:01,880
HERE. 

7482
04:06:01,880 --> 04:06:02,280
TOWARD THE WEST. 

7483
04:06:02,280 --> 04:06:04,115
THAT IS GRADUALLY GETTING IN 

7484
04:06:04,115 --> 04:06:04,449
HERE. 

7485
04:06:04,449 --> 04:06:05,751
IT WILL NOT SUDDENLY TAKE OVER 

7486
04:06:05,751 --> 04:06:07,885
IT AND MAKE IT FALL APART. 

7487
04:06:07,885 --> 04:06:08,453
THAT WOULD BE NICE. 

7488
04:06:08,453 --> 04:06:10,055
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING THE 

7489
04:06:10,055 --> 04:06:10,288
HAPPEN. 

7490
04:06:10,288 --> 04:06:11,957
THAT'S PART OF THE COLD FRONT 

7491
04:06:11,957 --> 04:06:13,458
WITH HIGH PRESSURE OUT TO THE 

7492
04:06:13,458 --> 04:06:15,560
EAST, THE COLD FRONT TO THE 

7493
04:06:15,560 --> 04:06:17,362
WEST ACTING LIKE A SQUEEZE PLAY 

7494
04:06:17,362 --> 04:06:18,296
THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE 

7495
04:06:18,296 --> 04:06:20,565
HURRICANE ALL TOWARD THE 

7496
04:06:20,565 --> 04:06:20,865
NORTHEAST. 

7497
04:06:20,865 --> 04:06:22,100
IT WILL STAY A HURRICANE AT 

7498
04:06:22,100 --> 04:06:25,837
LEAST THROUGH THE MID EVENING 

7499
04:06:25,837 --> 04:06:26,070
HOURS. 

7500
04:06:26,070 --> 04:06:27,105
LIKELY UNTIL THE 11:00 

7501
04:06:27,105 --> 04:06:27,372
ADVISORY. 

7502
04:06:27,372 --> 04:06:28,340
THEN IT WILL BE DOWNGRADED. 

7503
04:06:28,340 --> 04:06:29,307
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE WINDS THAT 

7504
04:06:29,307 --> 04:06:31,810
ARE QUITE TO THE LEVEL OF WHAT 

7505
04:06:31,810 --> 04:06:32,444
THE ADVISORY SAYS. 

7506
04:06:32,444 --> 04:06:34,112
BUT, WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN 

7507
04:06:34,112 --> 04:06:38,283
WINDS AT LEAST IN GUSTS OF 100 

7508
04:06:38,283 --> 04:06:40,452
TO 130 FROM MARIANA ALL THE WAY 

7509
04:06:40,452 --> 04:06:40,985
TO THE COAST. 

7510
04:06:40,985 --> 04:06:41,953
THERE'S STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR 

7511
04:06:41,953 --> 04:06:46,124
AT LEAST HURRICANE FORCE WIND 

7512
04:06:46,124 --> 04:06:46,357
GUSTS. 

7513
04:06:46,357 --> 04:06:47,893
75 MILES AN HOUR. 

7514
04:06:47,893 --> 04:06:52,864
THROUGHOUT PARTS OF SOUTHWEST 

7515
04:06:52,864 --> 04:06:53,999
GEORGIA. 

7516
04:06:53,999 --> 04:06:55,667
THE FUTURECAST STILL SHOWS 

7517
04:06:55,667 --> 04:06:59,037
WIDESPREAD AREA OF 45 TO 55 

7518
04:06:59,037 --> 04:07:01,339
MILES AN HOUR WINDS. 

7519
04:07:01,339 --> 04:07:02,340
THESE ARE SUSTAINED WINDS WITH 

7520
04:07:02,340 --> 04:07:04,843
GUSTS 20 TO 30 MILES AN HOUR 

7521
04:07:04,843 --> 04:07:05,543
ABOVE THAT. 

7522
04:07:05,543 --> 04:07:06,711
MOVING TO THE MID EVENING 

7523
04:07:06,711 --> 04:07:08,680
HOURS, YOU SEE THE STRONGER 

7524
04:07:08,680 --> 04:07:12,083
WINDS MOVING PRIMARILY OVER TO 

7525
04:07:12,083 --> 04:07:12,784
THOMAS COUNTY. 

7526
04:07:12,784 --> 04:07:13,018
WORTH. 

7527
04:07:13,018 --> 04:07:14,753
THEN, NOTICE THE LIGHT WINDS 

7528
04:07:14,753 --> 04:07:15,086
NEAR ALBANY. 

7529
04:07:15,086 --> 04:07:20,458
THAT'S CLOSER TO WHERE THE 

7530
04:07:20,458 --> 04:07:21,760
CENTER IS FORECAST TO BE. 

7531
04:07:21,760 --> 04:07:25,163
THEN IT CONTINUES TO GET BETTER 

7532
04:07:25,163 --> 04:07:25,463
AND BETTER. 

7533
04:07:25,463 --> 04:07:27,065
15 TO 25 MILES AN HOUR WIND 

7534
04:07:27,065 --> 04:07:27,298
RANGE. 

7535
04:07:27,298 --> 04:07:32,237
AND THE WESTERLY WIND WILL KICK 

7536
04:07:32,237 --> 04:07:33,238
IN AND HELP THINGS OUT. 

7537
04:07:33,238 --> 04:07:35,440
THE SURGE, WE'VE PEAKED AS FAR 

7538
04:07:35,440 --> 04:07:35,873
AS THE SURGE. 

7539
04:07:35,873 --> 04:07:40,378
WE'RE ALREADY PAST THE HIGH 

7540
04:07:40,378 --> 04:07:40,779
TIDE. 

7541
04:07:40,779 --> 04:07:42,280
AND, STILL GETTING NEAR HIGH 

7542
04:07:42,280 --> 04:07:42,580
TIDE. 

7543
04:07:42,580 --> 04:07:46,084
BUT, THE WORST OF THE ON SHORE 

7544
04:07:46,084 --> 04:07:46,851
WIND HAS DEPARTED. 

7545
04:07:46,851 --> 04:07:48,586
REGARDLESS OF ALL THAT, A WHOLE 

7546
04:07:48,586 --> 04:07:53,058
LOT OF WATER GOT SHOVED UP INTO 

7547
04:07:53,058 --> 04:07:53,491
APALACHICOLA BAY. 

7548
04:07:53,491 --> 04:07:57,462
BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE OF IT, IT 

7549
04:07:57,462 --> 04:07:57,963
HAS NOWHERE TO GO. 

7550
04:07:57,963 --> 04:08:00,565
IT WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE IN A 

7551
04:08:00,565 --> 04:08:01,666
HURRY. 

7552
04:08:01,666 --> 04:08:05,170
THERE IS EXTREME STORM SURGE 

7553
04:08:05,170 --> 04:08:06,103
FLOODING GOING ON. 

7554
04:08:06,103 --> 04:08:07,639
IT WILL TAKE UNTIL TOMORROW OR 

7555
04:08:07,639 --> 04:08:09,140
OVERNIGHT AS THE WINDS SHIFT 

7556
04:08:09,140 --> 04:08:11,042
DIRECTION TO ALLOW THE WATER TO 

7557
04:08:11,042 --> 04:08:11,575
START MOVING BACK OUT. 

7558
04:08:11,575 --> 04:08:13,979
SO IT'S STILL NOT SAFE AT ALL 

7559
04:08:13,979 --> 04:08:14,880
ALONG THE COASTAL AREAS TO 

7560
04:08:14,880 --> 04:08:17,882
VENTURE OUT UNTIL WE START TO 

7561
04:08:17,882 --> 04:08:18,749
SEE THE WATER RECEDING. 

7562
04:08:18,749 --> 04:08:20,685
THE LATEST REPORTS WE HAVE ARE 

7563
04:08:20,685 --> 04:08:22,687
HOURS OLD AND HAD NINE TO TEN 

7564
04:08:22,687 --> 04:08:24,422
FEET OF STORM SURGE. 

7565
04:08:24,422 --> 04:08:27,192
THE RAINFALL AMOUNTS, THESE ARE 

7566
04:08:27,192 --> 04:08:27,592
NOT UPDATED YET. 

7567
04:08:27,592 --> 04:08:29,093
BUT, WE'VE SEEN THREE TO SIX 

7568
04:08:29,093 --> 04:08:31,596
INCHES OF RAIN OVER WESTERN 

7569
04:08:31,596 --> 04:08:31,829
AREAS. 

7570
04:08:31,829 --> 04:08:33,999
I COULD EASILY SEE ANOTHER 

7571
04:08:33,999 --> 04:08:35,500
COUPLE OF INCHES OF RAIN 

7572
04:08:35,500 --> 04:08:36,801
FALLING IN THAT REGION CLOSER 

7573
04:08:36,801 --> 04:08:42,073
TO THE CENTER AND UP INTO SOUTH 

7574
04:08:42,073 --> 04:08:42,340
GEORGIA. 

7575
04:08:42,340 --> 04:08:42,940
LIGHTER AMOUNTS FURTHER EAST. 

7576
04:08:42,940 --> 04:08:44,476
A POTENTIAL FOR THE RAIN BANDS 

7577
04:08:44,476 --> 04:08:46,277
TO CAUSE FLASH FLOODING SO THE 

7578
04:08:46,277 --> 04:08:47,712
COASTAL WINDS ARE GETTING 

7579
04:08:47,712 --> 04:08:47,945
BETTER. 

7580
04:08:47,945 --> 04:08:50,215
THE INLAND WINDS ARE SHIFTING A 

7581
04:08:50,215 --> 04:08:51,783
LITTLE MORE FROM THE WESTERN 

7582
04:08:51,783 --> 04:08:53,985
HALF OF THE BIG BEND. 

7583
04:08:53,985 --> 04:08:54,986
MORE INTO SOUTHWEST GEORGIA OF 

7584
04:08:54,986 --> 04:08:57,355
SEEING THOSE 50 TO 60 MILES AN 

7585
04:08:57,355 --> 04:08:58,690
HOUR GUSTS PERHAPS TOPPING 75. 

7586
04:08:58,690 --> 04:08:59,557
STILL THE HEAVY RAIN. 

7587
04:08:59,557 --> 04:09:00,725
THE THREAT THAT WE HAVEN'T 

7588
04:09:00,725 --> 04:09:03,595
TALKED MUCH ABOUT IS STILL A 

7589
04:09:03,595 --> 04:09:03,962
FEW TORNADOES. 

7590
04:09:03,962 --> 04:09:07,399
FORTUNATELY, THAT HAS NOT BEEN 

7591
04:09:07,399 --> 04:09:07,832
A MAJOR ISSUE. 

7592
04:09:07,832 --> 04:09:10,902
BUT EVERY LANDFALL SYSTEM HAS A 

7593
04:09:10,902 --> 04:09:11,469
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT THREAT. 

7594
04:09:11,469 --> 04:09:13,405
FOR THE BANDS REMOVED FROM THE 

7595
04:09:13,405 --> 04:09:15,173
CENTER OF CREATING TORNADOES SO 

7596
04:09:15,173 --> 04:09:17,575
WE'LL STAY ON GUARD FOR THAT 

7597
04:09:17,575 --> 04:09:17,908
POSSIBILITY. 

7598
04:09:17,908 --> 04:09:18,476
THAT INCLUDES EASTERN AREAS 

7599
04:09:18,476 --> 04:09:21,112
WHERE YOU MAY HAVE ONLY SEEN 

7600
04:09:21,112 --> 04:09:21,913
SHOWERS AND BREEZY CONDITIONS. 

7601
04:09:21,913 --> 04:09:24,416
YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO A PLACE OF 

7602
04:09:24,416 --> 04:09:29,888
SAFETY IF A TORNADO WARNING IS 

7603
04:09:29,888 --> 04:09:30,121
ISSUED. 

7604
04:09:30,121 --> 04:09:33,892
AND THE COASTAL FLOODING 

7605
04:09:33,892 --> 04:09:35,259
CONTINUING A FEW MORE HOURS. 

7606
04:09:35,259 --> 04:09:36,594
ALL RIGHT, SO WE ADAPTED, WE 

7607
04:09:36,594 --> 04:09:38,229
SHOWED YOU THE RADAR AND 

7608
04:09:38,229 --> 04:09:38,963
EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON. 

7609
04:09:38,963 --> 04:09:40,432
I'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND 

7610
04:09:40,432 --> 04:09:41,766
TOSS IT BACK TO YOU GUYS AND 

7611
04:09:41,766 --> 04:09:44,736
I'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE BIT. 

7612
04:09:44,736 --> 04:09:45,103
>> THANKS MIKE. 

7613
04:09:45,103 --> 04:09:47,472
WE HAVE BEEN SCOURING OUR 

7614
04:09:47,472 --> 04:09:47,705
PHONES. 

7615
04:09:47,705 --> 04:09:49,074
LOOKING AT SOME TWEETS FROM 

7616
04:09:49,074 --> 04:09:49,407
DAVID BISHOP. 

7617
04:09:49,407 --> 04:09:51,076
HE USED TO BE A REPORTER HERE 

7618
04:09:51,076 --> 04:09:53,078
YEARS AGO BACK IN THE DAY AS 

7619
04:09:53,078 --> 04:09:53,344
THEY SAY. 

7620
04:09:53,344 --> 04:09:56,281
HE'S REPORTING THAT THE ROOF OF 

7621
04:09:56,281 --> 04:09:57,315
THE MARIANA POLICE DEPARTMENT 

7622
04:09:57,315 --> 04:09:57,916
HAS BLOWN OFF. 

7623
04:09:57,916 --> 04:09:59,217
AND HAS SENT SOME PICTURES OF 

7624
04:09:59,217 --> 04:10:03,822
DAMAGE THERE IN DUN TOWN 

7625
04:10:03,822 --> 04:10:04,089
MARIANA. 

7626
04:10:04,089 --> 04:10:07,492
THAT'S ABOUT AN HOUR WEST OF 

7627
04:10:07,492 --> 04:10:07,926
HERE. 

7628
04:10:07,926 --> 04:10:08,459
GETTING SOME STRONG WINDS 

7629
04:10:08,459 --> 04:10:08,693
THERE. 

7630
04:10:08,693 --> 04:10:10,128
>> AND WE'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT 

7631
04:10:10,128 --> 04:10:11,962
OF PICTURES AND VIDEO FROM YOU 

7632
04:10:11,962 --> 04:10:13,631
AND OTHER VIEWERS ACROSS THE 

7633
04:10:13,631 --> 04:10:15,133
REGION, WE HOPE YOU WILL SHARE 

7634
04:10:15,133 --> 04:10:17,902
MORE OF THOSE IN THE COMING 

7635
04:10:17,902 --> 04:10:21,806
MINUTES AND HOURS INCLUDING 

7636
04:10:21,806 --> 04:10:22,507
FROM SHONDA KNIGHT. 

7637
04:10:22,507 --> 04:10:25,310
SOME DAMAGE TO HER OWN HOME. 

7638
04:10:25,310 --> 04:10:26,377
UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE THAT. 

7639
04:10:26,377 --> 04:10:30,014
AND WE WANT TO CHECK IN WITH 

7640
04:10:30,014 --> 04:10:32,450
ABBY WALTON WHERE THE SHELTER 

7641
04:10:32,450 --> 04:10:37,355
CONTINUES TO BE CROWDED AT THE 

7642
04:10:37,355 --> 04:10:37,689
HIGH SCHOOL. 

7643
04:10:37,689 --> 04:10:38,189
ABBY? 

7644
04:10:38,189 --> 04:10:39,724
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 

7645
04:10:39,724 --> 04:10:40,925
I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT 

7646
04:10:40,925 --> 04:10:41,993
SHONDA. 

7647
04:10:41,993 --> 04:10:44,028
SHE AND HER FAMILY ARE NOW HERE 

7648
04:10:44,028 --> 04:10:45,030
AT THE SCHOOL. 

7649
04:10:45,030 --> 04:10:46,197
THE REASON YOU SEE LIGHTS AND 

7650
04:10:46,197 --> 04:10:48,399
THINGS ON, WE'RE ON A GENERATOR 

7651
04:10:48,399 --> 04:10:48,633
NOW. 

7652
04:10:48,633 --> 04:10:50,535
WE LOST POWER, WE LOST POWER A 

7653
04:10:50,535 --> 04:10:50,835
WHILE AGO. 

7654
04:10:50,835 --> 04:10:53,705
SO WE ARE ON A BACKUP 

7655
04:10:53,705 --> 04:10:54,005
GENERATOR. 

7656
04:10:54,005 --> 04:10:55,206
SO PEOPLE A LITTLE WORRIED AS 

7657
04:10:55,206 --> 04:10:57,108
THEIR PHONE BATTERIES START TO 

7658
04:10:57,108 --> 04:10:58,176
DIE. 

7659
04:10:58,176 --> 04:10:59,443
THAT SORT OF THING. 

7660
04:10:59,443 --> 04:11:04,048
YOU CAN SEE THERE WERE PEOPLE 

7661
04:11:04,048 --> 04:11:05,650
IN THE AREA NOW. 

7662
04:11:05,650 --> 04:11:07,952
THEY CAN GET SNACKS. 

7663
04:11:07,952 --> 04:11:08,953
THE SNACKS ARE PROVIDED. 

7664
04:11:08,953 --> 04:11:10,255
PEOPLE GETTING CRACKERS AND 

7665
04:11:10,255 --> 04:11:10,722
THINGS LIKE THAT. 

7666
04:11:10,722 --> 04:11:14,092
DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, WE DID 

7667
04:11:14,092 --> 04:11:18,163
HAVE ONE FAMILY THAT WAS 

7668
04:11:18,163 --> 04:11:20,131
REMOVED FROM OUR AREA. 

7669
04:11:20,131 --> 04:11:21,232
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE REMOVED 

7670
04:11:21,232 --> 04:11:21,532
THE FAMILY. 

7671
04:11:21,532 --> 04:11:23,935
I'M TOLD THAT'S BECAUSE THE 

7672
04:11:23,935 --> 04:11:25,036
FATHER WAS BEING A LITTLE 

7673
04:11:25,036 --> 04:11:26,104
DISORDERLY AND NOT VERY 

7674
04:11:26,104 --> 04:11:26,804
NEIGHBORLY TO SOME OF THE 

7675
04:11:26,804 --> 04:11:31,009
PEOPLE HERE SO THEY FELT LIKE 

7676
04:11:31,009 --> 04:11:33,411
IT WAS BEST FOR LCSO TO COME 

7677
04:11:33,411 --> 04:11:34,946
AND REMOVE THAT FAMILY. 

7678
04:11:34,946 --> 04:11:37,248
IT WASN'T A BIG SCENE, BUT THEY 

7679
04:11:37,248 --> 04:11:38,550
FELT IT NECESSARY TO REMOVE 

7680
04:11:38,550 --> 04:11:38,883
THAT FAMILY. 

7681
04:11:38,883 --> 04:11:40,351
SO NOW, EVERYBODY KIND OF JUST 

7682
04:11:40,351 --> 04:11:42,854
SITS AND WAITS AND I DO HAVE TO 

7683
04:11:42,854 --> 04:11:44,255
SAY EDEN AND JULIE, AS THIS 

7684
04:11:44,255 --> 04:11:45,189
STORM IS PROGRESSING AND PEOPLE 

7685
04:11:45,189 --> 04:11:46,958
ARE NOW BEING ABLE TO SEE 

7686
04:11:46,958 --> 04:11:48,459
PICTURES ON THEIR PHONES AND 

7687
04:11:48,459 --> 04:11:50,028
GET TEXTS FROM FAMILIES 

7688
04:11:50,028 --> 04:11:51,329
THROUGHOUT THE AREA, YOU ARE 

7689
04:11:51,329 --> 04:11:53,932
STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE GO HOW'S 

7690
04:11:53,932 --> 04:11:54,766
YOUR FAMILY? 

7691
04:11:54,766 --> 04:11:55,667
ARE YOU OKAY? 

7692
04:11:55,667 --> 04:11:56,801
HOW IS YOUR HOUSE? 

7693
04:11:56,801 --> 04:11:58,203
AND SOME OF THE PICTURES THAT 

7694
04:11:58,203 --> 04:11:59,871
WE'RE SEEING FROM PEOPLE'S CELL 

7695
04:11:59,871 --> 04:12:01,306
PHONES AND TEXTS THEY'RE 

7696
04:12:01,306 --> 04:12:03,441
SHOWING US ARE JUST VERY 

7697
04:12:03,441 --> 04:12:03,775
DEVASTATING. 

7698
04:12:03,775 --> 04:12:08,546
AND SO, I THINK THE BIG MESSAGE 

7699
04:12:08,546 --> 04:12:11,049
RIGHT NOW IS LOVE ONE ANOTHER 

7700
04:12:11,049 --> 04:12:17,889
AND THIS COMMUNITY IS SO FULL 

7701
04:12:17,889 --> 04:12:18,189
OF LOVE. 

7702
04:12:18,189 --> 04:12:20,558
WE'LL HAVE TO HOLD ONTO ONE 

7703
04:12:20,558 --> 04:12:23,861
ANOTHER IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT 

7704
04:12:23,861 --> 04:12:24,061
TIME. 

7705
04:12:24,061 --> 04:12:32,937
>> THE STRESS OF THIS STORM IS 

7706
04:12:32,937 --> 04:12:33,237
INCREDIBLE. 

7707
04:12:33,237 --> 04:12:34,839
THE NOT KNOWING WHAT'S 

7708
04:12:34,839 --> 04:12:36,808
HAPPENING AT THEIR HOUSES I'M 

7709
04:12:36,808 --> 04:12:42,947
SURE IS ON TOP OF THEIR LINES. 

7710
04:12:42,947 --> 04:12:43,381
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

7711
04:12:43,381 --> 04:12:43,781
ABSOLUTELY JULIE. 

7712
04:12:43,781 --> 04:12:46,251
AND SO, THEY JUST ARE KIND OF 

7713
04:12:46,251 --> 04:12:47,886
SEEING WHAT NEIGHBORS ARE 

7714
04:12:47,886 --> 04:12:49,120
SHOWING THEM. 

7715
04:12:49,120 --> 04:12:52,357
NEIGHBORS THAT HAVE STAYED AND 

7716
04:12:52,357 --> 04:12:54,959
KIND OF WONDERING WILL THIS BE 

7717
04:12:54,959 --> 04:12:55,225
MY HOUSE. 

7718
04:12:55,225 --> 04:12:56,394
BESIDES THIS BUILDING THERE WAS 

7719
04:12:56,394 --> 04:12:57,762
ANOTHER BUILDING WHERE SEVERAL 

7720
04:12:57,762 --> 04:12:59,264
PEOPLE ARE OVER THERE WITH 

7721
04:12:59,264 --> 04:13:00,565
THEIR PETS AND THERE ARE 

7722
04:13:00,565 --> 04:13:01,366
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETS OVER 

7723
04:13:01,366 --> 04:13:01,599
THERE. 

7724
04:13:01,599 --> 04:13:03,267
AND WHEN I WAS THERE A LITTLE 

7725
04:13:03,267 --> 04:13:04,869
BIT EARLIER BEFORE THE STORM 

7726
04:13:04,869 --> 04:13:06,237
REALLY GOT GOING, THOSE POOR 

7727
04:13:06,237 --> 04:13:09,540
LITTLE ANIMALS WERE AS YOU CAN 

7728
04:13:09,540 --> 04:13:11,743
IMAGINE PRETTY STRESSED OUT. 

7729
04:13:11,743 --> 04:13:13,344
AND THE LEON COUNTY SHELTER 

7730
04:13:13,344 --> 04:13:14,979
DOING A GREAT JOB AT MAKING 

7731
04:13:14,979 --> 04:13:17,348
SURE EVERYBODY, ALL THE ANIMALS 

7732
04:13:17,348 --> 04:13:20,217
STAY SAFE DURING THE STORM. 

7733
04:13:20,217 --> 04:13:21,185
SO AGAIN, EVERYBODY HERE IS 

7734
04:13:21,185 --> 04:13:22,587
JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF 

7735
04:13:22,587 --> 04:13:23,421
IT AT THIS POINT. 

7736
04:13:23,421 --> 04:13:25,189
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 

7737
04:13:25,189 --> 04:13:27,492
BACK HERE, PEOPLE ARE GETTING 

7738
04:13:27,492 --> 04:13:28,092
KIND OF TIRED. 

7739
04:13:28,092 --> 04:13:28,559
TAKING MORE NAPS. 

7740
04:13:28,559 --> 04:13:31,863
THAT SORT OF THING AS THIS DAY 

7741
04:13:31,863 --> 04:13:32,263
PROGRESSES. 

7742
04:13:32,263 --> 04:13:34,198
>> OKAY ABBY, THANK YOU SO 

7743
04:13:34,198 --> 04:13:34,398
MUCH. 

7744
04:13:34,398 --> 04:13:36,801
AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SPIRIT 

7745
04:13:36,801 --> 04:13:38,202
OF LOVE AND THE SPIRIT OF 

7746
04:13:38,202 --> 04:13:39,103
HELPING EACH OTHER. 

7747
04:13:39,103 --> 04:13:41,939
THAT IS SO EVIDENCE IN THIS 

7748
04:13:41,939 --> 04:13:42,940
COMMUNITY ALL YEARLONG. 

7749
04:13:42,940 --> 04:13:44,942
I KNOW IN THE YEARS PAST, WE 

7750
04:13:44,942 --> 04:13:46,844
HAVE WATCHED OUR NEIGHBORS TO 

7751
04:13:46,844 --> 04:13:51,382
THE WEST BE FOLKS EVACUATING 

7752
04:13:51,382 --> 04:13:52,583
FROM KATRINA CAME HERE IN THEIR 

7753
04:13:52,583 --> 04:13:55,787
TIME OF NEED AND IN SOME CASES 

7754
04:13:55,787 --> 04:13:56,020
STAYED. 

7755
04:13:56,020 --> 04:13:58,089
NOW IT'S OUR TURN, WE'RE SO 

7756
04:13:58,089 --> 04:13:59,190
THANKFUL NOT ONLY FOR EACH 

7757
04:13:59,190 --> 04:14:00,992
OTHER AND THE SUPPORT WE CAN 

7758
04:14:00,992 --> 04:14:02,894
PROVIDE BUT ALL THE PEOPLE 

7759
04:14:02,894 --> 04:14:03,894
COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITY FROM 

7760
04:14:03,894 --> 04:14:06,698
OTHER COMMUNITIES TO HELP US AT 

7761
04:14:06,698 --> 04:14:07,398
THIS TIME. 

7762
04:14:07,398 --> 04:14:09,600
>> AND YOU MENTIONED THE 

7763
04:14:09,600 --> 04:14:10,301
PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL. 

7764
04:14:10,301 --> 04:14:12,169
THE STRESS, THE ANXIETY. 

7765
04:14:12,169 --> 04:14:13,738
THAT IS REAL. 

7766
04:14:13,738 --> 04:14:15,239
AND THAT CAN HAVE LASTING 

7767
04:14:15,239 --> 04:14:15,740
EFFECTS. 

7768
04:14:15,740 --> 04:14:21,479
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE CRISIS 

7769
04:14:21,479 --> 04:14:22,079
COUNSELORS BEING BROUGHT IN. 

7770
04:14:22,079 --> 04:14:24,282
PEOPLE SEEKING HELP FROM THEIR 

7771
04:14:24,282 --> 04:14:24,982
RELIGION, THEIR FAITH, OTHER 

7772
04:14:24,982 --> 04:14:25,215
MEANS. 

7773
04:14:25,215 --> 04:14:29,921
IF YOU SEE THIS KIND OF DAMAGE 

7774
04:14:29,921 --> 04:14:31,289
AND YOU DEAL WITH THIS 

7775
04:14:31,289 --> 04:14:33,491
SITUATION, YOU DON'T JUST TOUGH 

7776
04:14:33,491 --> 04:14:33,724
IT OUT. 

7777
04:14:33,724 --> 04:14:34,024
MAYBE NOT. 

7778
04:14:34,024 --> 04:14:35,493
IT'S A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND 

7779
04:14:35,493 --> 04:14:37,295
IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO MOVE 

7780
04:14:37,295 --> 04:14:39,163
ON, TO CLEAN UP, THERE ARE SO 

7781
04:14:39,163 --> 04:14:40,798
MANY STRESSES AND SO MANY 

7782
04:14:40,798 --> 04:14:44,168
FACTORS INVOLVED SO THAT'S 

7783
04:14:44,168 --> 04:14:45,570
IMPORTANT IN THE DAYS TO COME. 

7784
04:14:45,570 --> 04:14:49,273
>> NOT JUST RESTORING POWER AND 

7785
04:14:49,273 --> 04:14:51,141
CLEANING UP, BUT RESTORING 

7786
04:14:51,141 --> 04:14:51,976
YOURSELF. 

7787
04:14:51,976 --> 04:14:52,577
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

7788
04:14:52,577 --> 04:14:52,910
THAT'S RIGHT. 

7789
04:14:52,910 --> 04:14:57,915
>>> WELL, ALICIA TURNER IS IN 

7790
04:14:57,915 --> 04:14:58,382
DOWNTOWN TALLAHASSEE. 

7791
04:14:58,382 --> 04:14:59,016
WHAT DO YOU SEE? 

7792
04:14:59,016 --> 04:14:59,917
>> Reporter: WELL, EARLIER 

7793
04:14:59,917 --> 04:15:00,818
TODAY, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 

7794
04:15:00,818 --> 04:15:02,220
HOW SOME OF THE ROADS HAD 

7795
04:15:02,220 --> 04:15:04,922
ALREADY BEEN BLOCKED OFF BY THE 

7796
04:15:04,922 --> 04:15:05,155
DEBRIS. 

7797
04:15:05,155 --> 04:15:07,291
AND THAT NUMBER CONTINUING TO 

7798
04:15:07,291 --> 04:15:09,394
GROW. 

7799
04:15:09,394 --> 04:15:11,095
NOW, WE'RE ON VIRGINIA NEAR 

7800
04:15:11,095 --> 04:15:15,299
DUVALL NEAR DOWNTOWN 

7801
04:15:15,299 --> 04:15:15,632
TALLAHASSEE. 

7802
04:15:15,632 --> 04:15:17,201
YOU CAN SEE WHERE A LIMB HAS 

7803
04:15:17,201 --> 04:15:20,772
SNAPPED OFF A TREE AND IS 

7804
04:15:20,772 --> 04:15:21,372
BLOCKING THE ROADWAY HERE. 

7805
04:15:21,372 --> 04:15:23,574
WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE TRYING TO 

7806
04:15:23,574 --> 04:15:23,907
GET THROUGH. 

7807
04:15:23,907 --> 04:15:25,910
PEOPLE TRYING TO ASSESS SOME OF 

7808
04:15:25,910 --> 04:15:26,210
THE DAMAGE. 

7809
04:15:26,210 --> 04:15:27,711
AS WE HAVE BEEN OUT, WE'VE SEEN 

7810
04:15:27,711 --> 04:15:30,615
HOW THE DEBRIS IS IN THE 

7811
04:15:30,615 --> 04:15:31,315
STREETS. 

7812
04:15:31,315 --> 04:15:32,317
WIND GUSTS STILL COMING 

7813
04:15:32,317 --> 04:15:32,583
THROUGH. 

7814
04:15:32,583 --> 04:15:34,085
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND SEE HOW 

7815
04:15:34,085 --> 04:15:35,820
THE WIND IS BLOWING REALLY 

7816
04:15:35,820 --> 04:15:37,822
HEAVY AND THE AREA RIGHT NOW. 

7817
04:15:37,822 --> 04:15:39,323
SO, THERE'S STILL POTENTIAL FOR 

7818
04:15:39,323 --> 04:15:40,457
MORE DAMAGE TO HAPPEN. 

7819
04:15:40,457 --> 04:15:42,193
BUT, THIS IS JUST REALTIME HOW 

7820
04:15:42,193 --> 04:15:44,228
THIS DAMAGE IS HAPPENING AS WE 

7821
04:15:44,228 --> 04:15:44,461
SPEAK. 

7822
04:15:44,461 --> 04:15:47,131
AND SOME OF THESE ROADS JUST 

7823
04:15:47,131 --> 04:15:47,664
COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF. 

7824
04:15:47,664 --> 04:15:50,134
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE OUT, 

7825
04:15:50,134 --> 04:15:50,367
DON'T. 

7826
04:15:50,367 --> 04:15:52,236
JUST LOOKING BEHIND ME AND THE 

7827
04:15:52,236 --> 04:15:53,271
PICTURES WE HAVE ON OUR WEBSITE 

7828
04:15:53,271 --> 04:15:55,807
AND THE THINGS PEOPLE HAVE 

7829
04:15:55,807 --> 04:15:56,140
TWEETED OUT. 

7830
04:15:56,140 --> 04:15:57,575
JUST AS YOU MENTIONED, THE ROAD 

7831
04:15:57,575 --> 04:15:59,610
TO RECOVERY, IT'S GOING TO BE A 

7832
04:15:59,610 --> 04:15:59,876
LONG ONE. 

7833
04:15:59,876 --> 04:16:02,113
JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 

7834
04:16:02,113 --> 04:16:04,816
DAMAGE AND SOME OF THE THINGS 

7835
04:16:04,816 --> 04:16:05,817
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. 

7836
04:16:05,817 --> 04:16:07,518
SEEING THE ROOF EARLIER TODAY 

7837
04:16:07,518 --> 04:16:08,152
OFF ADAMS STREET. 

7838
04:16:08,152 --> 04:16:09,720
WE'RE OUT AND ABOUT STAYING 

7839
04:16:09,720 --> 04:16:11,989
SAFE AND SHOWING YOU SOME OF 

7840
04:16:11,989 --> 04:16:14,125
THE DAMAGE THAT IS BEING CAUSED 

7841
04:16:14,125 --> 04:16:14,692
RIGHT HERE IN TALLAHASSEE. 

7842
04:16:14,692 --> 04:16:16,194
MOST OF IT IS JUST FROM THE 

7843
04:16:16,194 --> 04:16:18,329
WIND AND SOME OF THESE TREES 

7844
04:16:18,329 --> 04:16:19,030
SNAPPING CLEAN IN HALF. 

7845
04:16:19,030 --> 04:16:20,531
EARLIER BEFORE I WAS CUT OFF, 

7846
04:16:20,531 --> 04:16:22,533
YOU GUYS ASKED ME ABOUT THE 

7847
04:16:22,533 --> 04:16:23,534
POWER WHERE I WAS. 

7848
04:16:23,534 --> 04:16:24,568
THERE WAS NO POWER. 

7849
04:16:24,568 --> 04:16:26,070
JUST LOOKING DOWN, I DON'T SEE 

7850
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:27,905
ANY STREET LIGHTS FOR ABOUT A 

7851
04:16:27,905 --> 04:16:28,406
BLOCK OR SO. 

7852
04:16:28,406 --> 04:16:31,409
AND I'M SURE IF I TRAVEL EVEN 

7853
04:16:31,409 --> 04:16:32,710
FURTHER, THAT WILL CONTINUE TO 

7854
04:16:32,710 --> 04:16:34,044
BE THE CASE. 

7855
04:16:34,044 --> 04:16:35,746
NO POWER IN THIS AREA. 

7856
04:16:35,746 --> 04:16:37,215
HEARD A LOT OF TRANSFORMERS 

7857
04:16:37,215 --> 04:16:40,251
BLOW THE LAST HOUR, THE HOUR-

7858
04:16:40,251 --> 04:16:40,817
AND-A-HALF OR SO. 

7859
04:16:40,817 --> 04:16:42,453
SO AS PEOPLE ARE WORKING TO SEE 

7860
04:16:42,453 --> 04:16:43,921
WHEN THEY GET THEIR POWER BACK 

7861
04:16:43,921 --> 04:16:45,356
ON, THEY ARE STARTING TO SEE 

7862
04:16:45,356 --> 04:16:47,258
THIS DAMAGE AS IT IS HAPPENING 

7863
04:16:47,258 --> 04:16:48,359
AND WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME, 

7864
04:16:48,359 --> 04:16:53,898
THIS IS JUST A LITTLE PIECE OF 

7865
04:16:53,898 --> 04:16:56,133
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 

7866
04:16:56,133 --> 04:16:56,500
IN TALLAHASSEE. 

7867
04:16:56,500 --> 04:16:57,468
>> ALICIA, YOU STAY SAFE OUT 

7868
04:16:57,468 --> 04:17:02,540
THERE FOR SURE, IT'S A LITTLE 

7869
04:17:02,540 --> 04:17:03,407
PRECARIOUS TO BE OUT THERE. 

7870
04:17:03,407 --> 04:17:05,510
>> PLEASE BE SAFE OUT THERE AS 

7871
04:17:05,510 --> 04:17:07,745
YOU SHARE THESE IMAGES FROM 

7872
04:17:07,745 --> 04:17:08,245
ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY. 

7873
04:17:08,245 --> 04:17:13,651
>> WE WANT TO SHOW YOU DAMAGE 

7874
04:17:13,651 --> 04:17:14,185
VIDEO. 

7875
04:17:14,185 --> 04:17:15,753
OH, THERE GOES A TREE. 

7876
04:17:15,753 --> 04:17:17,255
THAT SHOWS IT RIGHT THERE, THAT 

7877
04:17:17,255 --> 04:17:19,824
TREE LOOKS LIKE IT WAS ALREADY 

7878
04:17:19,824 --> 04:17:20,057
SPLIT. 

7879
04:17:20,057 --> 04:17:21,359
AND THEN IT FELL. 

7880
04:17:21,359 --> 04:17:22,893
AND PULLED UP BY THE ROOTS. 

7881
04:17:22,893 --> 04:17:23,861
THIS IS FROM EAST POINT. 

7882
04:17:23,861 --> 04:17:25,328
>> OH MY GOODNESS. 

7883
04:17:25,328 --> 04:17:27,565
>> WE HAD SOME TALLAHASSEE 

7884
04:17:27,565 --> 04:17:29,066
DAMAGE VIDEO AS WELL. 

7885
04:17:29,066 --> 04:17:31,068
>> THAT WITH SENT TO US FROM 

7886
04:17:31,068 --> 04:17:31,469
GREG GILBERT. 

7887
04:17:31,469 --> 04:17:33,104
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENDING 

7888
04:17:33,104 --> 04:17:35,239
THAT AND I'M SO THANKFUL THE 

7889
04:17:35,239 --> 04:17:36,340
TREE FELL IN THE OPPOSITE 

7890
04:17:36,340 --> 04:17:36,640
DIRECTION. 

7891
04:17:36,640 --> 04:17:37,341
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT 

7892
04:17:37,341 --> 04:17:38,809
HAPPENED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU 

7893
04:17:38,809 --> 04:17:42,346
AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR 

7894
04:17:42,346 --> 04:17:42,680
HOME. 

7895
04:17:42,680 --> 04:17:44,382
>> I SAW THAT COMMENT FROM 

7896
04:17:44,382 --> 04:17:44,749
SOMEONE ELSE. 

7897
04:17:44,749 --> 04:17:46,350
THEY HAD VIDEO OF A PINE TREE 

7898
04:17:46,350 --> 04:17:48,152
THAT HAD FALLEN AND THEY SAID 

7899
04:17:48,152 --> 04:17:50,154
THANKFUL IT FELL AWAY FROM THE 

7900
04:17:50,154 --> 04:17:50,454
HOUSE. 

7901
04:17:50,454 --> 04:17:50,721
>> RIGHT. 

7902
04:17:50,721 --> 04:17:52,957
>> SOME WILL BE LUCKY HERE. 

7903
04:17:52,957 --> 04:17:53,658
THAT'S THE CASE. 

7904
04:17:53,658 --> 04:17:54,659
OTHERS AS WE'VE SEEN, THE 

7905
04:17:54,659 --> 04:17:55,960
TREE'S GOING TO FALL RIGHT ON 

7906
04:17:55,960 --> 04:17:56,661
THE HOUSE. 

7907
04:17:56,661 --> 04:17:58,095
RIGHT ON THE CAR. 

7908
04:17:58,095 --> 04:18:02,867
AS WE SAW SO MANY TIMES DURING 

7909
04:18:02,867 --> 04:18:07,338
HERMINE AS WELL. 

7910
04:18:07,338 --> 04:18:11,542
>> I THINK THIS STORM IS OVER, 

7911
04:18:11,542 --> 04:18:12,643
THE DAMAGE WILL BE EXTENSIVE. 

7912
04:18:12,643 --> 04:18:14,979
>> WE WILL TALK ABOUT MICHAEL 

7913
04:18:14,979 --> 04:18:18,182
FOR A LONG TIME. 

7914
04:18:18,182 --> 04:18:22,786
LET'S CHECK IN WITH MARIEL. 

7915
04:18:22,786 --> 04:18:23,120
WHAT'S NEW? 

7916
04:18:23,120 --> 04:18:24,088
>> Reporter: WELL, THERE IS 

7917
04:18:24,088 --> 04:18:26,257
SOME DISCUSSION GOING ON RIGHT 

7918
04:18:26,257 --> 04:18:27,959
NOW ABOUT POSSIBLY GETTING THE 

7919
04:18:27,959 --> 04:18:30,661
FORCED RESPONDERS BACK ON THE 

7920
04:18:30,661 --> 04:18:30,861
ROAD. 

7921
04:18:30,861 --> 04:18:31,562
IT'S NOT CONFIRMED YET. 

7922
04:18:31,562 --> 04:18:32,196
BUT SOMETHING THEY'RE 

7923
04:18:32,196 --> 04:18:36,000
DISCUSSING AS THE WINDS HAVE 

7924
04:18:36,000 --> 04:18:38,135
BEEN A LITTLE LOWER. 

7925
04:18:38,135 --> 04:18:41,939
THE WINDS NED TO DIE DOWN A 

7926
04:18:41,939 --> 04:18:44,374
LITTLE MORE BEFORE THE UTILITY 

7927
04:18:44,374 --> 04:18:45,142
CREWS HEAD OUT. 

7928
04:18:45,142 --> 04:18:47,178
THE RESPONDERS WOULD BE CALLED 

7929
04:18:47,178 --> 04:18:47,478
BACK IN. 

7930
04:18:47,478 --> 04:18:49,947
>>> AND HILLARY LANE JOINS US 

7931
04:18:49,947 --> 04:18:52,183
NOW FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH, 

7932
04:18:52,183 --> 04:18:52,483
FLORIDA. 

7933
04:18:52,483 --> 04:18:55,486
HILLARY, YOU HAVE BEEN THERE IN 

7934
04:18:55,486 --> 04:18:57,888
PANAMA CITY BEACH REPORTING ON 

7935
04:18:57,888 --> 04:19:01,292
THIS STORM SINCE MONDAY IF 

7936
04:19:01,292 --> 04:19:01,659
THAT'S CORRECT. 

7937
04:19:01,659 --> 04:19:04,795
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU 

7938
04:19:04,795 --> 04:19:05,295
EXPERIENCED SINCE THEN? 

7939
04:19:05,295 --> 04:19:07,198
>> Reporter: IT WAS VERY 

7940
04:19:07,198 --> 04:19:07,999
INTERESTING. 

7941
04:19:07,999 --> 04:19:09,300
WHEN WE FIRST GOT TO PANAMA 

7942
04:19:09,300 --> 04:19:11,502
CITY BEACH MONDAY, IT WAS 

7943
04:19:11,502 --> 04:19:11,969
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. 

7944
04:19:11,969 --> 04:19:12,436
SAME WITH YESTERDAY. 

7945
04:19:12,436 --> 04:19:13,170
LITERALLY THE CALM BEFORE IF 

7946
04:19:13,170 --> 04:19:13,403
STORM. 

7947
04:19:13,403 --> 04:19:16,774
IT COULD NOT BE A MORE PERFECT 

7948
04:19:16,774 --> 04:19:17,541
DAY. 

7949
04:19:17,541 --> 04:19:17,874
SUNNY SKIES. 

7950
04:19:17,874 --> 04:19:18,643
THE WATER WAS BEAUTIFUL. 

7951
04:19:18,643 --> 04:19:21,479
AND, THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY 

7952
04:19:21,479 --> 04:19:21,846
NICE OVERNIGHT. 

7953
04:19:21,846 --> 04:19:22,747
BUT, ABOUT 8:00 A.M., EARLIER 

7954
04:19:22,747 --> 04:19:23,781
THIS MORNING IS WHEN THINGS 

7955
04:19:23,781 --> 04:19:26,017
RIGHT HERE IN THE AREA WHERE WE 

7956
04:19:26,017 --> 04:19:27,652
ARE REALLY STARTED TO CHANGE. 

7957
04:19:27,652 --> 04:19:30,187
AND THEY REALLY STARTED TO 

7958
04:19:30,187 --> 04:19:30,487
INTENSIFY. 

7959
04:19:30,487 --> 04:19:31,154
BETWEEN NOON AND 2:00 P.M. 

7960
04:19:31,154 --> 04:19:33,290
THAT'S WHEN WE GOT THE BRUNT OF 

7961
04:19:33,290 --> 04:19:34,191
THE STORM. 

7962
04:19:34,191 --> 04:19:36,894
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETELY 

7963
04:19:36,894 --> 04:19:37,795
DIFFERENT AREA THAN THE 

7964
04:19:37,795 --> 04:19:39,797
BEAUTIFUL SUNNY BEACH WE SAW 

7965
04:19:39,797 --> 04:19:40,097
YESTERDAY. 

7966
04:19:40,097 --> 04:19:40,798
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE NOW? 

7967
04:19:40,798 --> 04:19:44,502
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING'S A 

7968
04:19:44,502 --> 04:19:45,302
BIT CALMER NOW. 

7969
04:19:45,302 --> 04:19:45,669
IS THAT RIGHT? 

7970
04:19:45,669 --> 04:19:48,572
>> Reporter: IT'S VERY, VERY 

7971
04:19:48,572 --> 04:19:49,073
CALM RIGHT NOW. 

7972
04:19:49,073 --> 04:19:49,874
ESPECIALLY COMPARATIVELY. 

7973
04:19:49,874 --> 04:19:51,976
BUT YOU COULD STILL GET A SENSE 

7974
04:19:51,976 --> 04:19:53,978
OF HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS DONE TO 

7975
04:19:53,978 --> 04:19:54,611
THIS AREA. 

7976
04:19:54,611 --> 04:19:55,479
HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS. 

7977
04:19:55,479 --> 04:19:56,881
YOU CAN SEE THE ROOF ON THIS 

7978
04:19:56,881 --> 04:19:59,383
CONVENIENCE STORE IS LIFTED UP. 

7979
04:19:59,383 --> 04:20:00,884
IT CONTINUES TO FLOW IN THE 

7980
04:20:00,884 --> 04:20:01,085
WIND. 

7981
04:20:01,085 --> 04:20:02,386
WE'RE EXPECTING THAT ROOF IF 

7982
04:20:02,386 --> 04:20:04,588
THE WIND PICKS UP AGAIN TO 

7983
04:20:04,588 --> 04:20:05,222
COMPLETELY FLY OFF. 

7984
04:20:05,222 --> 04:20:06,390
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BY NOW. 

7985
04:20:06,390 --> 04:20:08,092
AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU OVER 

7986
04:20:08,092 --> 04:20:09,794
HERE, OUR PHOTOGRAPHER GARY 

7987
04:20:09,794 --> 04:20:11,295
WILL PAN OVER. 

7988
04:20:11,295 --> 04:20:16,100
THIS STOP SIGN IS COMPLETELY 

7989
04:20:16,100 --> 04:20:16,433
TILTED OVER. 

7990
04:20:16,433 --> 04:20:20,071
AND UP ABOVE IT, THE GASOLINE 

7991
04:20:20,071 --> 04:20:20,271
SIGN. 

7992
04:20:20,271 --> 04:20:21,572
THE STOP SNAPPED BRANCHES, 

7993
04:20:21,572 --> 04:20:23,874
DOWNED TREES ALONG THE AREA AND 

7994
04:20:23,874 --> 04:20:26,077
ESPECIALLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS 

7995
04:20:26,077 --> 04:20:28,011
AS WELL IN THE LOWER LYING 

7996
04:20:28,011 --> 04:20:28,512
AREAS. 

7997
04:20:28,512 --> 04:20:30,314
SOME OF THOSE HOMES WERE 

7998
04:20:30,314 --> 04:20:31,315
COMPLETELY DEVASTATED OR 

7999
04:20:31,315 --> 04:20:32,616
COMPLETELY RUINED AND THE 

8000
04:20:32,616 --> 04:20:34,118
INTERESTING PART HERE IS THIS 

8001
04:20:34,118 --> 04:20:35,052
STORM WAS SO SEVERE. 

8002
04:20:35,052 --> 04:20:36,320
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA SAID 

8003
04:20:36,320 --> 04:20:38,122
LISTEN, OUR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL 

8004
04:20:38,122 --> 04:20:41,225
CANNOT GO OUT AND RESCUE YOU 

8005
04:20:41,225 --> 04:20:43,394
BECAUSE IT WOULD PUT THEIR 

8006
04:20:43,394 --> 04:20:43,794
LIVES IN DANGER. 

8007
04:20:43,794 --> 04:20:44,795
NOW EMERGENCY WORKERS ARE 

8008
04:20:44,795 --> 04:20:46,263
STARTING TO GET OUT AND SURVEY 

8009
04:20:46,263 --> 04:20:49,633
THE AREA AND GETTING A SENSE IF 

8010
04:20:49,633 --> 04:20:51,135
THERE WERE ANY INJURIES OR IF 

8011
04:20:51,135 --> 04:20:52,236
ANYONE PASSED AWAY IN THE 

8012
04:20:52,236 --> 04:20:52,470
STORM. 

8013
04:20:52,470 --> 04:20:54,805
>> SO YOU ARE SEEING THE 

8014
04:20:54,805 --> 04:20:57,107
ACTIVITY ON THE ROADS? 

8015
04:20:57,107 --> 04:20:59,643
THE FIRST RESPONDERS GETTING 

8016
04:20:59,643 --> 04:21:00,578
OUT AND HELPING PEOPLE? 

8017
04:21:00,578 --> 04:21:01,545
>> Reporter: YEAH, THIS IS THE 

8018
04:21:01,545 --> 04:21:03,114
FIRST TIME IT'S CALM ENOUGH FOR 

8019
04:21:03,114 --> 04:21:03,814
THEM TO GET OUT. 

8020
04:21:03,814 --> 04:21:06,217
WE ARE TOLD THEY ARE STARTING 

8021
04:21:06,217 --> 04:21:06,717
TO DO THAT. 

8022
04:21:06,717 --> 04:21:08,919
A BIG PART OF IT IS SURVEYING 

8023
04:21:08,919 --> 04:21:09,754
THE DAMAGE. 

8024
04:21:09,754 --> 04:21:11,122
ELECTRICITY IS A BEING ISSUE. 

8025
04:21:11,122 --> 04:21:12,923
A LOT OF THE ELECTRICITY IS 

8026
04:21:12,923 --> 04:21:13,224
OUT. 

8027
04:21:13,224 --> 04:21:14,625
AND WE'RE FURTHER INLAND SO WE 

8028
04:21:14,625 --> 04:21:17,895
CAN JUST IMAGINE HOW BAD IT 

8029
04:21:17,895 --> 04:21:20,898
MUST BE FOR THE COASTAL AREAS. 

8030
04:21:20,898 --> 04:21:22,266
UPWARDS OF 280,000 PEOPLE 

8031
04:21:22,266 --> 04:21:22,766
WITHOUT POWER. 

8032
04:21:22,766 --> 04:21:23,968
AND THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA 

8033
04:21:23,968 --> 04:21:27,705
SAID THE FIRST ISSUE, THE FIRST 

8034
04:21:27,705 --> 04:21:29,105
THING THEY HAVE TO DO IS GET 

8035
04:21:29,105 --> 04:21:32,676
THE POWER BACK ON. 

8036
04:21:32,676 --> 04:21:35,446
>> HILLARY, WE UNDERSTAND 

8037
04:21:35,446 --> 04:21:39,150
THERE'S ALMOST 260,000 PEOPLE 

8038
04:21:39,150 --> 04:21:39,783
WITHOUT POWER ACROSS FLORIDA. 

8039
04:21:39,783 --> 04:21:41,217
OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION 

8040
04:21:41,217 --> 04:21:41,852
PEOPLE. 

8041
04:21:41,852 --> 04:21:45,055
HOW IS THAT AFFECTING THE FOLKS 

8042
04:21:45,055 --> 04:21:46,190
THERE WHERE YOU ARE? 

8043
04:21:46,190 --> 04:21:47,458
>> Reporter: I THINK THE MOST 

8044
04:21:47,458 --> 04:21:48,959
DIFFICULT PART ABOUT IT IS YOU 

8045
04:21:48,959 --> 04:21:50,661
CAN'T USE YOUR APPLIANCES AND 

8046
04:21:50,661 --> 04:21:51,261
IT'S VERY HOT. 

8047
04:21:51,261 --> 04:21:53,330
IN OUR HOTEL ROOM, THIS IS 

8048
04:21:53,330 --> 04:21:55,065
FLORIDA, IT'S OCTOBER, STILL 

8049
04:21:55,065 --> 04:21:56,467
EXTREMELY HOT. 

8050
04:21:56,467 --> 04:21:59,870
SO, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY, 

8051
04:21:59,870 --> 04:22:01,338
FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED 

8052
04:22:01,338 --> 04:22:03,641
MEDICATIONS REFRIGERATED THIS 

8053
04:22:03,641 --> 04:22:08,179
COULD BE DEADLY FOR THESE 

8054
04:22:08,179 --> 04:22:08,412
PEOPLE. 

8055
04:22:08,412 --> 04:22:09,580
FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, BABIES, THE 

8056
04:22:09,580 --> 04:22:09,847
ELDERLY. 

8057
04:22:09,847 --> 04:22:10,948
>> WHAT ARE THE TEMPERATURES 

8058
04:22:10,948 --> 04:22:11,448
LIKE THERE NOW? 

8059
04:22:11,448 --> 04:22:12,850
IT'S OCTOBER SO I IMAGINE IT'S 

8060
04:22:12,850 --> 04:22:16,987
NOT AS HOT AS IT WAS JUST A 

8061
04:22:16,987 --> 04:22:17,287
MONTH AGO. 

8062
04:22:17,287 --> 04:22:19,422
>> Reporter: YEAH, IT'S NOT IN 

8063
04:22:19,422 --> 04:22:22,092
THE 80s  OR 90s . THANK GOD 

8064
04:22:22,092 --> 04:22:23,661
THIS ISN'T JULY OR AUGUST 

8065
04:22:23,661 --> 04:22:24,394
BECAUSE NOT HAVING ELECTRICITY 

8066
04:22:24,394 --> 04:22:27,064
WOULD BE TOUGHER BUT IT'S IN 

8067
04:22:27,064 --> 04:22:28,365
THE 70s . IT'S PRETTY WARM. 

8068
04:22:28,365 --> 04:22:31,969
ESPECIALLY IN OUR HOTEL ROOM. 

8069
04:22:31,969 --> 04:22:32,303
IT GETS HOT. 

8070
04:22:32,303 --> 04:22:32,703
IT GETS SOGGY. 

8071
04:22:32,703 --> 04:22:34,338
AND THEN ANOTHER ISSUE IS FOR 

8072
04:22:34,338 --> 04:22:35,740
PEOPLE LIVING IN AREAS CLOSER 

8073
04:22:35,740 --> 04:22:39,743
TO THE BEACH, THE WATER HAS 

8074
04:22:39,743 --> 04:22:41,278
FLOODED. 

8075
04:22:41,278 --> 04:22:41,879
WE SAW NIT OUR HOTEL. 

8076
04:22:41,879 --> 04:22:43,781
THE WATER SEEPS INTO THE CARPET 

8077
04:22:43,781 --> 04:22:45,783
AND MOLD CAN FORM. 

8078
04:22:45,783 --> 04:22:47,317
SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. 

8079
04:22:47,317 --> 04:22:47,818
ESPECIALLY WITHOUT AIR-

8080
04:22:47,818 --> 04:22:48,151
CONDITIONING. 

8081
04:22:48,151 --> 04:22:50,087
THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE LIKELY 

8082
04:22:50,087 --> 04:22:50,620
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. 

8083
04:22:50,620 --> 04:22:53,757
>> HILLARY LANE, THANK YOU SO 

8084
04:22:53,757 --> 04:22:55,492
MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING. 

8085
04:22:55,492 --> 04:22:57,194
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

8086
04:22:57,194 --> 04:22:57,494
BREAK. 

8087
04:22:57,494 --> 04:22:59,897
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MUCH MORE 

8088
04:22:59,897 --> 04:23:00,097
CBSN. 

8089
04:23:00,097 --> 04:23:00,364
DON'T GO AWAY. 

8090
04:25:12,730 --> 04:25:16,633
>> I WANT TO TURN TO COVERAGE 

8091
04:25:16,633 --> 04:25:17,902
FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE 

8092
04:25:17,902 --> 04:25:19,503
FOR MORE ON HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

8093
04:25:19,503 --> 04:25:21,505
>> THINGS GOT REALLY, REALLY 

8094
04:25:21,505 --> 04:25:22,038
BAD OUT THERE. 

8095
04:25:22,038 --> 04:25:25,809
IT IS ACTUALLY CALM AT THE 

8096
04:25:25,809 --> 04:25:26,042
MOMENT. 

8097
04:25:26,042 --> 04:25:26,977
EXCEPT FOR THE WIND. 

8098
04:25:26,977 --> 04:25:28,545
THE WIND PICKS UP VERY STRONGLY 

8099
04:25:28,545 --> 04:25:29,746
NOT TOO LONG AGO. 

8100
04:25:29,746 --> 04:25:32,516
AND SO, THEY ASKED EVERYONE TO 

8101
04:25:32,516 --> 04:25:33,750
STAY INSIDE SO PEOPLE ARE NOT 

8102
04:25:33,750 --> 04:25:37,021
ABLE TO GO IN AND OUT AS THEY 

8103
04:25:37,021 --> 04:25:37,421
WERE BEFORE. 

8104
04:25:37,421 --> 04:25:40,056
SO, A BIT OF A CABIN FEVER. 

8105
04:25:40,056 --> 04:25:41,992
BUT, PEOPLE STILL GRATEFUL TO 

8106
04:25:41,992 --> 04:25:44,328
BE ABLE TO COME HERE AND HAVE A 

8107
04:25:44,328 --> 04:25:46,096
SAFE PLACE TO BE. 

8108
04:25:46,096 --> 04:25:49,333
WHILE ALL OF THIS GOES DOWN. 

8109
04:25:49,333 --> 04:25:50,267
MANY CHOOSING TO COME HERE 

8110
04:25:50,267 --> 04:25:51,535
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL SAFE 

8111
04:25:51,535 --> 04:25:51,935
IN THEIR HOME. 

8112
04:25:51,935 --> 04:25:53,971
AND MANY SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF 

8113
04:25:53,971 --> 04:25:54,271
THE TREES. 

8114
04:25:54,271 --> 04:25:56,106
A LOT OF THE FOLKS ARE FROM 

8115
04:25:56,106 --> 04:25:56,807
RIGHT IN THIS AREA. 

8116
04:25:56,807 --> 04:25:58,509
BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF TREES IN 

8117
04:25:58,509 --> 04:25:59,309
THEIR YARDS AND THEY DIDN'T 

8118
04:25:59,309 --> 04:26:02,212
WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES SO 

8119
04:26:02,212 --> 04:26:03,914
THAT'S WHY THEY CAME HERE. 

8120
04:26:03,914 --> 04:26:06,150
BUT AGAIN, JUST MOMENTS AGO, 

8121
04:26:06,150 --> 04:26:08,952
THEY ARE ASKING EVERYONE TO 

8122
04:26:08,952 --> 04:26:10,554
STAY INSIDE BECAUSE OF THE 

8123
04:26:10,554 --> 04:26:11,855
CONDITIONS OF THE WEATHER 

8124
04:26:11,855 --> 04:26:12,122
OUTSIDE. 

8125
04:26:12,122 --> 04:26:13,357
AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO KEEP 

8126
04:26:13,357 --> 04:26:13,757
EVERYONE POSTED. 

8127
04:26:13,757 --> 04:26:20,431
BUT FOR NOW, BACK TO YOU IN THE 

8128
04:26:20,431 --> 04:26:21,765
STUDIO. 

8129
04:26:21,765 --> 04:26:22,766
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

8130
04:26:22,766 --> 04:26:23,801
MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE THERE. 

8131
04:26:23,801 --> 04:26:25,669
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SHELTER TO 

8132
04:26:25,669 --> 04:26:26,369
RIDE OUT THE STORM. 

8133
04:26:26,369 --> 04:26:32,943
WE ARE GETTING MORE PICTURES BY 

8134
04:26:32,943 --> 04:26:33,544
THE MOMENT. 

8135
04:26:33,544 --> 04:26:34,344
THE TALLAHASSEE FIRE DEPARTMENT 

8136
04:26:34,344 --> 04:26:40,651
REMINDS FOLKS THAT IF YOU STEP 

8137
04:26:40,651 --> 04:26:41,852
OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME CONSIDER 

8138
04:26:41,852 --> 04:26:43,887
EVERY DOWNED POWER LINE AS A 

8139
04:26:43,887 --> 04:26:44,254
LIVE WIRE. 

8140
04:26:44,254 --> 04:26:45,556
THEY SENT OUT THAT REMINDER. 

8141
04:26:45,556 --> 04:26:46,957
>> AND TEAMS FROM THE SHERIFF'S 

8142
04:26:46,957 --> 04:26:48,959
OFFICE SAID THAT IS THE BIG 

8143
04:26:48,959 --> 04:26:50,160
DANGER FOR THE SHERIFF'S 

8144
04:26:50,160 --> 04:26:51,662
DEPUTIES WHEN THEY HEAD OUT 

8145
04:26:51,662 --> 04:26:52,663
AFTER THE THREAT PASSES. 

8146
04:26:52,663 --> 04:26:53,964
THEY STILL HAVE THE WIRES DOWN 

8147
04:26:53,964 --> 04:26:54,264
EVERYWHERE. 

8148
04:26:54,264 --> 04:26:59,870
AND  THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES 

8149
04:26:59,870 --> 04:27:04,942
ARE LIVE OR WHICH ONES ARE NOT. 

8150
04:27:04,942 --> 04:27:09,079
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE 

8151
04:27:09,079 --> 04:27:09,980
WIRES ARE SAFE. 

8152
04:27:09,980 --> 04:27:13,383
BEN CAPLIN HAS BEEN HOLDING 

8153
04:27:13,383 --> 04:27:17,154
DOWN THE FORT IN WAUCALA 

8154
04:27:17,154 --> 04:27:17,387
COUNTY. 

8155
04:27:17,387 --> 04:27:23,260
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S LESS RAIN ON 

8156
04:27:23,260 --> 04:27:26,396
YOUR LENS, THAT'S LOOKING 

8157
04:27:26,396 --> 04:27:26,663
IMPROVED. 

8158
04:27:26,663 --> 04:27:29,166
>> Reporter: WE'RE LOOKING AT 

8159
04:27:29,166 --> 04:27:29,666
GLASS HALF FULL. 

8160
04:27:29,666 --> 04:27:31,835
LESS WATER ON THE LENS. 

8161
04:27:31,835 --> 04:27:33,637
A LITTLE WIND. 

8162
04:27:33,637 --> 04:27:37,541
WE'RE AT A PARK RIGHT OFF HERE. 

8163
04:27:37,541 --> 04:27:38,308
IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN. 

8164
04:27:38,308 --> 04:27:40,043
WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH SOME OF 

8165
04:27:40,043 --> 04:27:40,677
WHAT WE'RE SEEING. 

8166
04:27:40,677 --> 04:27:41,311
THERE'S MORE TRAFFIC FLOWING 

8167
04:27:41,311 --> 04:27:43,180
THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN A LITTLE 

8168
04:27:43,180 --> 04:27:44,381
WHILE ON THE MAIN DRAG HERE. 

8169
04:27:44,381 --> 04:27:45,082
BUT LOOK AT THIS. 

8170
04:27:45,082 --> 04:27:50,187
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THE 

8171
04:27:50,187 --> 04:27:52,790
TREE JUST BENT IN HALF HERE. 

8172
04:27:52,790 --> 04:27:53,590
THAT'S THE DAMAGE WE'RE SEEING 

8173
04:27:53,590 --> 04:27:54,191
AT THE PARK. 

8174
04:27:54,191 --> 04:27:55,592
THE REASON WE PICKED THIS 

8175
04:27:55,592 --> 04:27:56,693
LOCATION, ONE, IS BECAUSE YES, 

8176
04:27:56,693 --> 04:27:59,562
THERE ARE TREES BUT I DON'T SEE 

8177
04:27:59,562 --> 04:28:01,899
ANY POWER LINES IN THE AREA. 

8178
04:28:01,899 --> 04:28:03,300
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THAT TOO. 

8179
04:28:03,300 --> 04:28:05,302
IT'S KIND OF A MICROCOSM OF 

8180
04:28:05,302 --> 04:28:06,403
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE WE'VE 

8181
04:28:06,403 --> 04:28:09,072
BEEN HERE THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE 

8182
04:28:09,072 --> 04:28:09,339
HOURS. 

8183
04:28:09,339 --> 04:28:11,007
A LOT OF DEBRIS. 

8184
04:28:11,007 --> 04:28:11,775
TREE BRANCHES DOWN. 

8185
04:28:11,775 --> 04:28:12,943
YOU SEE IT RIGHT HERE. 

8186
04:28:12,943 --> 04:28:15,179
AND WE'RE MAKING OUR WAY TO 

8187
04:28:15,179 --> 04:28:20,284
WHAT LOOKS TO BE A JUNGLE GYM 

8188
04:28:20,284 --> 04:28:20,617
IN THIS PARK. 

8189
04:28:20,617 --> 04:28:21,885
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS 

8190
04:28:21,885 --> 04:28:23,987
STANDING AFTER WHAT CAME 

8191
04:28:23,987 --> 04:28:25,289
THROUGH THIS AREA. 

8192
04:28:25,289 --> 04:28:26,890
AND AGAIN, THE WINDS CONTINUING 

8193
04:28:26,890 --> 04:28:27,691
TO BLOW HERE. 

8194
04:28:27,691 --> 04:28:29,693
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE. 

8195
04:28:29,693 --> 04:28:31,495
MY PHOTOGRAPHER RYAN KELLY 

8196
04:28:31,495 --> 04:28:31,928
POINTED THAT OUT. 

8197
04:28:31,928 --> 04:28:33,530
WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR OUR 

8198
04:28:33,530 --> 04:28:33,997
LIVE SHOT. 

8199
04:28:33,997 --> 04:28:36,066
HE TOOK A WALK THROUGH THE PARK 

8200
04:28:36,066 --> 04:28:39,002
AND SPOTTED THAT. 

8201
04:28:39,002 --> 04:28:40,070
THAT'S THE JUNGLE GYM THERE. 

8202
04:28:40,070 --> 04:28:42,939
AND YOU SEE THE DEBRIS ON THE 

8203
04:28:42,939 --> 04:28:43,173
GROUND. 

8204
04:28:43,173 --> 04:28:44,975
A LOT LIKE SOME OF THE ROADS. 

8205
04:28:44,975 --> 04:28:46,977
I DO WANT TO SAY THIS THOUGH. 

8206
04:28:46,977 --> 04:28:52,115
I CAME LIVE TO YOU GUYS MAYBE 

8207
04:28:52,115 --> 04:28:54,918
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO FROM AZALEA 

8208

DRIVE. 

8209
04:28:55,152 --> 04:28:56,720
AND WE NOTICED THAT TREE HAD 

8210
04:28:56,720 --> 04:28:57,921
BEEN CLEARED OFF THE ROAD. 

8211
04:28:57,921 --> 04:28:59,523
THEY ARE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB 

8212
04:28:59,523 --> 04:29:01,491
HERE JUST MAKING SURE ALL THE 

8213
04:29:01,491 --> 04:29:02,526
BIG DEBRIS AS MUCH AS THEY 

8214
04:29:02,526 --> 04:29:07,297
POSSIBLY CAN IS OUT OF THE WAY. 

8215
04:29:07,297 --> 04:29:08,532
IT'S AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR 

8216
04:29:08,532 --> 04:29:18,141
PEOPLE ONCE THEY ARE ABLE TO GO 

8217
04:29:18,141 --> 04:29:18,741

8218
04:29:18,741 --> 04:29:19,676
DO NOT GO OUTSIDE. 

8219
04:29:19,676 --> 04:29:22,079
THEY ARE DOING THE BEST THEY 

8220
04:29:22,079 --> 04:29:23,213

04:32:01,972 --> 04:32:04,341
IS BUILT CAT 3 STANDARDS? 

8247
04:32:04,341 --> 04:32:05,842
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS 

8248
04:32:05,842 --> 04:32:07,544
PARTICULAR SCHOOL. 

8249
04:32:07,544 --> 04:32:08,578
AGAIN, WE TALKED ABOUT IT. 

8250
04:32:08,578 --> 04:32:10,781
AFTER 1992, FLORIDA STARTED TO 

8251
04:32:10,781 --> 04:32:13,417
MAKE THE BUILDING CODE A LITTLE 

8252
04:32:13,417 --> 04:32:14,084
MORE STRINGENT. 

8253
04:32:14,084 --> 04:32:15,419
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL 2001 OR 

8254
04:32:15,419 --> 04:32:16,987
2002 WHERE THEY MADE IT 

8255
04:32:16,987 --> 04:32:19,523
MANDATORY FOR STRUCTURES TO BE 

8256
04:32:19,523 --> 04:32:22,192
BUILT TO WITHSTAND A CAT 3. BUT 

8257
04:32:22,192 --> 04:32:23,493
EVEN THAT STRUCTURE MAY NOT 

8258
04:32:23,493 --> 04:32:24,560
WITHSTAND A CAT 4 OR 5. 

8259
04:32:24,560 --> 04:32:26,997
>> HOW FAR INLAND WAS THIS? 

8260
04:32:26,997 --> 04:32:28,932
>> 20 MILES INLAND. 

8261
04:32:28,932 --> 04:32:29,900
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. 

8262
04:32:29,900 --> 04:32:32,202
IF A SCHOOL ROOF HAS BLOWN OFF 

8263
04:32:32,202 --> 04:32:33,270
AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING SHELTER 

8264
04:32:33,270 --> 04:32:35,972
THERE, IT DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE 

8265
04:32:35,972 --> 04:32:38,741
A GREAT SHELTER. 

8266
04:32:38,741 --> 04:32:40,777
>> I HOPE THEY'RE OKAY. 

8267
04:32:40,777 --> 04:32:42,178
>> I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE FINE. 

8268
04:32:42,178 --> 04:32:45,449
MY FAMILY HAS TALKED TO THEM. 

8269
04:32:45,449 --> 04:32:47,884
THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE LUCKY 

8270
04:32:47,884 --> 04:32:48,117
PEOPLE. 

8271
04:32:48,117 --> 04:32:51,822
THEY STAYED IN MOBILE HOMES. 

8272
04:32:51,822 --> 04:33:01,098
THEY STAYED IN STRUCTURES BUILT 

8273
04:33:01,098 --> 04:33:01,698
BEFORE 1992 OR 2002. 

8274
04:33:01,698 --> 04:33:05,901
>> SO HAS THE STORM REDUCED ITS 

8275
04:33:05,901 --> 04:33:08,371
INTENSE AT ALL? 

8276
04:33:08,371 --> 04:33:10,172
>> WINDS ARE DOWN TO 140 MILES 

8277
04:33:10,172 --> 04:33:10,473
AN HOUR. 

8278
04:33:10,473 --> 04:33:12,275
IT IS CROSSING THE GEORGIA 

8279
04:33:12,275 --> 04:33:12,608
FLORIDA LINE. 

8280
04:33:12,608 --> 04:33:14,144
BECAUSE IT WAS STRENGTHENING 

8281
04:33:14,144 --> 04:33:16,011
WHEN IT MADE LANDFALL, IT WILL 

8282
04:33:16,011 --> 04:33:17,748
WEAKEN A LITTLE LESS RAPIDLY 

8283
04:33:17,748 --> 04:33:18,615
AND CARRY THE HURRICANE FORCE 

8284
04:33:18,615 --> 04:33:20,450
WINDS AND DAMAGING WINDS 

8285
04:33:20,450 --> 04:33:22,219
STRAIGHT THROUGH GEORGIA. 

8286
04:33:22,219 --> 04:33:25,622
THERE WILL BE A SWATH OF 

8287
04:33:25,622 --> 04:33:29,926
DAMAGE, PROBABLY CAT 2 OR CAT 3 

8288
04:33:29,926 --> 04:33:32,896
DAMAGE IN PARTS OF SOUTHERN 

8289
04:33:32,896 --> 04:33:33,295
GEORGIA. 

8290
04:33:33,295 --> 04:33:34,931
WE SAW IT WITH CHARLIE. 

8291
04:33:34,931 --> 04:33:38,367
WE SAW IT WITH THIS STORM. 

8292
04:33:38,367 --> 04:33:39,503
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR THEY 

8293
04:33:39,503 --> 04:33:41,771
WERE STRENGTHENING STORMS AT 

8294
04:33:41,771 --> 04:33:42,038
LANDFALL. 

8295
04:33:42,038 --> 04:33:45,041
THEY HAVE TO PLATEAU. 

8296
04:33:45,041 --> 04:33:46,076
THEN THEY BEGIN TO WEAKEN. 

8297
04:33:46,076 --> 04:33:46,942
>> WHAT ABOUT RAINFALL? 

8298
04:33:46,942 --> 04:33:48,678
DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATES ON THAT? 

8299
04:33:48,678 --> 04:33:50,146
>> WELL, THE RAIN AT MAX, 

8300
04:33:50,146 --> 04:33:51,615
BECAUSE THE STORM IS MOVING 

8301
04:33:51,615 --> 04:33:53,517
FAST WILL BE ABOUT A FOOT, GIVE 

8302
04:33:53,517 --> 04:33:55,819
OR TAKE A LITTLE MORE THAN 

8303
04:33:55,819 --> 04:33:56,219
THAT. 

8304
04:33:56,219 --> 04:33:57,119
THAT'S OKAY IN NORTH FLORIDA. 

8305
04:33:57,119 --> 04:33:58,622
BUT IT WILL CAUSE FLASH 

8306
04:33:58,622 --> 04:33:59,387
FLOODING IN GEORGIA. 

8307
04:33:59,387 --> 04:34:01,124
AND THEN, ONCE IT GETS INTO 

8308
04:34:01,124 --> 04:34:03,726
PLACES LIKE SOUTH AND NORTH 

8309
04:34:03,726 --> 04:34:05,929
CAROLINA WHERE WE STILL HAVE 

8310
04:34:05,929 --> 04:34:06,630
SATURATED GROUND, SWOLLEN 

8311
04:34:06,630 --> 04:34:08,131
RIVERS, WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE 

8312
04:34:08,131 --> 04:34:09,132
ANOTHER ROUND OF SUBSTANTIAL 

8313
04:34:09,132 --> 04:34:09,532
FLOODING THERE. 

8314
04:34:09,532 --> 04:34:15,071
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN LATER 

8315
04:34:15,071 --> 04:34:15,338
TONIGHT. 

8316
04:34:15,338 --> 04:34:16,171
STARTING  LATER TONIGHT. 

8317
04:34:16,171 --> 04:34:17,973
THE HEAVIER STUFF MOVING IN. 

8318
04:34:17,973 --> 04:34:22,746
TOMORROW IS WHEN THE TROPICAL 

8319
04:34:22,746 --> 04:34:23,346
STORM MOVES ACROSS. 

8320
04:34:23,346 --> 04:34:24,648
THERE IS A CHANCE OF TORNADOES 

8321
04:34:24,648 --> 04:34:24,948
AS WELL. 

8322
04:34:24,948 --> 04:34:26,115
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THE 

8323
04:34:26,115 --> 04:34:26,750
POSSIBILITY OF TORNADOES. 

8324
04:34:26,750 --> 04:34:30,754
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN REGARDS 

8325
04:34:30,754 --> 04:34:31,254
TO THAT? 

8326
04:34:31,254 --> 04:34:31,621
ANY INDICATION? 

8327
04:34:31,621 --> 04:34:33,456
>> SURE, EVERY LANDFALLING 

8328
04:34:33,456 --> 04:34:35,926
TROPICAL SYSTEM PRODUCES 

8329
04:34:35,926 --> 04:34:36,225
TORNADOES. 

8330
04:34:36,225 --> 04:34:38,662
SOME PRODUCE A LOT. 

8331
04:34:38,662 --> 04:34:39,261
SOME PRODUCE LESS. 

8332
04:34:39,261 --> 04:34:41,731
EITHER WAY, THERE WILL BE FAST 

8333
04:34:41,731 --> 04:34:42,365
MOVING RAIN WRAPPED TORNADOES. 

8334
04:34:42,365 --> 04:34:43,833
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM AND IT IS 

8335
04:34:43,833 --> 04:34:45,969
VERY HARD TO PREPARE FOR THEM. 

8336
04:34:45,969 --> 04:34:48,137
WHEN WE SEE THEM AS 

8337
04:34:48,137 --> 04:34:48,772
METEOROLOGISTS THEY'RE MOVING 

8338
04:34:48,772 --> 04:34:50,006
60, 70, 80 MILES AN HOUR. 

8339
04:34:50,006 --> 04:34:51,508
WHEN WE SEE THEM, WE MAY GIVE 

8340
04:34:51,508 --> 04:34:52,809
YOU A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEAD 

8341
04:34:52,809 --> 04:34:53,008
TIME. 

8342
04:34:53,008 --> 04:34:55,078
BUT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE 

8343
04:34:55,078 --> 04:34:56,379
THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE WRAPPED IN 

8344
04:34:56,379 --> 04:34:56,746
RAIN. 

8345
04:34:56,746 --> 04:34:57,446
IT'S JUST A DIFFICULT 

8346
04:34:57,446 --> 04:34:57,747
SITUATION. 

8347
04:34:57,747 --> 04:34:59,549
BUT AGAIN, THE SYSTEM IS GOING 

8348
04:34:59,549 --> 04:35:00,183
TO BE WEAKENING TONIGHT. 

8349
04:35:00,183 --> 04:35:03,553
AND I THINK BY TOMORROW MORNING 

8350
04:35:03,553 --> 04:35:06,022
IT SHOULD BE AROUND TROPICAL 

8351
04:35:06,022 --> 04:35:08,658
STORM STATUS. 

8352
04:35:08,658 --> 04:35:10,293
>> SO WHAT'S 2 BIGGEST DANGER? 

8353
04:35:10,293 --> 04:35:10,961
>> WIND DAMAGE. 

8354
04:35:10,961 --> 04:35:13,463
AND THEN THE FOCUS WILL TURN TO 

8355
04:35:13,463 --> 04:35:16,565
FRESH WATER RAIN FLOODING 

8356
04:35:16,565 --> 04:35:17,267
DAMAGE STARTING TOMORROW AND 

8357
04:35:17,267 --> 04:35:19,269
INTO FRIDAY MORNING, THE STORM 

8358
04:35:19,269 --> 04:35:21,670
WILL BE MOVING OFFSHORE FRIDAY 

8359
04:35:21,670 --> 04:35:22,072
MORNING. 

8360
04:35:22,072 --> 04:35:27,242
IT'S NOT MOVING AT THE PACE 

8361
04:35:27,242 --> 04:35:27,576
FLORENCE DID. 

8362
04:35:27,576 --> 04:35:27,910
MUCH SLOWER. 

8363
04:35:27,910 --> 04:35:29,446
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING IN 

8364
04:35:29,446 --> 04:35:29,679
AUGUST. 

8365
04:35:29,679 --> 04:35:30,480
PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT POWER 

8366
04:35:30,480 --> 04:35:31,847
THREE WEEKS OR SO. 

8367
04:35:31,847 --> 04:35:33,883
THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY WON'T 

8368
04:35:33,883 --> 04:35:34,484
NEED THEIR AIR-CONDITIONING 

8369
04:35:34,484 --> 04:35:35,986
QUITE AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD IN 

8370
04:35:35,986 --> 04:35:37,554
AUGUST, THIS WILL BE BETTER FOR 

8371
04:35:37,554 --> 04:35:40,155
THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW, RELY 

8372
04:35:40,155 --> 04:35:41,424
ON AIR-CONDITIONING AND 

8373
04:35:41,424 --> 04:35:41,925
ELECTRICITY. 

8374
04:35:41,925 --> 04:35:44,060
BUT STILL, IT WON'T BE EASY. 

8375
04:35:44,060 --> 04:35:45,962
>> THAT'S HELPFUL FOR THE 

8376
04:35:45,962 --> 04:35:46,229
ELDERLY. 

8377
04:35:46,229 --> 04:35:47,897
SO MANY WHO PERISH WHEN THERE'S 

8378
04:35:47,897 --> 04:35:49,766
NO AIR-CONDITIONING IN MID 

8379
04:35:49,766 --> 04:35:50,065
AUGUST. 

8380
04:35:50,065 --> 04:35:51,167
>> WE SAW WITH HURRICANE MARIA, 

8381
04:35:51,167 --> 04:35:52,969
IT WASN'T SO MUCH THE DAY OF 

8382
04:35:52,969 --> 04:35:54,871
THE STORM PEOPLE DIED BUT THE 

8383
04:35:54,871 --> 04:35:55,639
AFTERMATH GETTING SUPPLIES TO 

8384
04:35:55,639 --> 04:35:55,872
PEOPLE. 

8385
04:35:55,872 --> 04:35:56,840
PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY OR 

8386
04:35:56,840 --> 04:35:57,973
THE ESSENTIALS TO GET THEM 

8387
04:35:57,973 --> 04:35:58,241
THROUGH. 

8388
04:35:58,241 --> 04:36:07,850
AND SO, WE SAW A LOT OF DEATHS 

8389
04:36:07,850 --> 04:36:12,489
AFTER THE DAY MARIA HIT. 

8390
04:36:12,489 --> 04:36:15,091
>> YOU MENTIONED THE FRESH 

8391
04:36:15,091 --> 04:36:17,225
WATER SURGE. 

8392
04:36:17,225 --> 04:36:18,094
IS THAT MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE 

8393
04:36:18,094 --> 04:36:21,797
OCEAN SURGE THAT WILL GO BACK 

8394
04:36:21,797 --> 04:36:21,998
OUT? 

8395
04:36:21,998 --> 04:36:26,036
>> THEY ARE BOTH SOMEWHAT 

8396
04:36:26,036 --> 04:36:29,873
EQUALLY DANGEROUS. 

8397
04:36:29,873 --> 04:36:33,776
THE SURGE WILL GO BACK OUT. 

8398
04:36:33,776 --> 04:36:35,510
AS WE SAW WITH FLORENCE, THE 

8399
04:36:35,510 --> 04:36:37,012
FRESH WATER FLOODING CAN LINGER 

8400
04:36:37,012 --> 04:36:38,114
FOR DAYS AND DAYS. 

8401
04:36:38,114 --> 04:36:40,283
THE LAST THING THEY NEEDED WAS 

8402
04:36:40,283 --> 04:36:41,685
THE FLOODING FROM HEAVY RAIN 

8403
04:36:41,685 --> 04:36:42,617
BUT THEY'LL GET IT AGAIN. 

8404
04:36:42,617 --> 04:36:44,487
>> JEFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 

8405
04:36:44,487 --> 04:36:44,820
THAT UPDATE. 

8406
04:36:44,820 --> 04:36:45,889
WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND BE 

8407
04:36:45,889 --> 04:36:47,991
RIGHT BACK WITH MUCH MORE CBSN. 

8408
04:36:47,991 --> 04:36:48,224
STAY WITH US. 

8409
04:38:47,976 --> 04:38:50,246
>> FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE. 

8410
04:38:50,246 --> 04:38:50,980
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY. 

8411
04:38:50,980 --> 04:38:57,353
>> AT 12:00 NOON, HIGH TIDE 

8412
04:38:57,353 --> 04:38:57,754
ROLLED IN. 

8413
04:38:57,754 --> 04:38:59,455
>> YOU CAN'T TELL THE RIVERS 

8414
04:38:59,455 --> 04:38:59,989
FROM THE ROADS. 

8415
04:38:59,989 --> 04:39:01,257
>> THIS WAS A MASSIVE OAK TREE. 

8416
04:39:01,257 --> 04:39:04,694
>> FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES 

8417
04:39:04,694 --> 04:39:17,973
THEY ARE HOPING THEY WILL STILL 

8418
04:39:17,973 --> 04:39:19,341
HAVE HOMES TO RETURN INTO. 

8419
04:39:22,212 --> 04:39:23,213
>>> HELLO EVERYONE, I'M TANYA 

8420
04:39:23,213 --> 04:39:24,647
RIVERO. 

8421
04:39:24,647 --> 04:39:25,748
HURRICANE MICHAEL IS NOW ONE OF 

8422
04:39:25,748 --> 04:39:26,616
THE MOST POWERFUL STORMS TO HIT 

8423
04:39:26,616 --> 04:39:29,117
THE U.S. MAINLAND. 

8424
04:39:29,117 --> 04:39:30,687
THE STORM MADE LANDFALL AS A 

8425
04:39:30,687 --> 04:39:32,921
CATEGORY 4 HITTING THE FLORIDA 

8426
04:39:32,921 --> 04:39:34,690
PANHANDLE NEAR MEXICO BEACH, 

8427
04:39:34,690 --> 04:39:36,359
THE HURRICANE IS NOW A CATEGORY 

8428
04:39:36,359 --> 04:39:38,394
3 BUT IS STILL PACKING QUITE A 

8429
04:39:38,394 --> 04:39:39,863
PUNCH. 

8430
04:39:39,863 --> 04:39:42,331
MORE THAN 257,000 PEOPLE ARE 

8431
04:39:42,331 --> 04:39:44,701
WITHOUT POWER. 

8432
04:39:44,701 --> 04:39:45,869
CBS NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER DAVID 

8433
04:39:45,869 --> 04:39:48,838
PARKINSON JOINS US NOW. 

8434
04:39:48,838 --> 04:39:50,540
SO DOWN TO A CATEGORY 3, BUT 

8435
04:39:50,540 --> 04:39:53,343
STILL A VERY, VERY POWERFUL 

8436
04:39:53,343 --> 04:39:53,576
STORM. 

8437
04:39:53,576 --> 04:39:54,177
IS THE WORST OF IT OVER? 

8438
04:39:54,177 --> 04:39:56,479
>> TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. 

8439
04:39:56,479 --> 04:39:58,014
I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE IN ANY 

8440
04:39:58,014 --> 04:39:58,681
OF THE PLACES WHERE THE STORM 

8441
04:39:58,681 --> 04:40:01,818
MADE LANDFALL, THE CONDITIONS 

8442
04:40:01,818 --> 04:40:04,754
WILL BE GETTING GRADUALLY 

8443
04:40:04,754 --> 04:40:06,456
BETTER. 

8444
04:40:06,456 --> 04:40:07,724
THE RAIN WILL STOP IN PANAMA 

8445
04:40:07,724 --> 04:40:08,825
CITY THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 

8446
04:40:08,825 --> 04:40:11,461
THE WIND IS IN THE 30#S# . I 

8447
04:40:11,461 --> 04:40:14,530
WANT TO CAUTION PEOPLE DON'T 

8448
04:40:14,530 --> 04:40:18,635
THINK JUST BECAUSE THE WORST OF 

8449
04:40:18,635 --> 04:40:20,470
THE STORM IS PASSED THAT YOU 

8450
04:40:20,470 --> 04:40:21,971
SHOULD GO OUTSIDE, THERE WILL 

8451
04:40:21,971 --> 04:40:22,639
BE A LOT OF DOWNED POWER LINES, 

8452
04:40:22,639 --> 04:40:24,107
LOTS OF DEBRIS. 

8453
04:40:24,107 --> 04:40:27,510
IT WILL BE QUITE DANGEROUS. 

8454
04:40:27,510 --> 04:40:29,412
THAT'S ASSUMING YOU DIDN'T 

8455
04:40:29,412 --> 04:40:30,179
EVACUATE WHICH AGAIN, YOU 

8456
04:40:30,179 --> 04:40:30,713
SHOULD HAVE EVACUATED. 

8457
04:40:30,713 --> 04:40:34,383
>> IS A CATEGORY 3 STILL STRONG 

8458
04:40:34,383 --> 04:40:35,885
ENOUGH TO LAUNCH TREES AND 

8459
04:40:35,885 --> 04:40:37,020
OTHER ITEMS INTO THE IR AND 

8460
04:40:37,020 --> 04:40:39,055
MAKE THEM DEADLY PROJECTILES? 

8461
04:40:39,055 --> 04:40:41,690
>> OH IT IS. 

8462
04:40:41,690 --> 04:40:43,393
TREES COME DOWN IN 50, 60 MILES 

8463
04:40:43,393 --> 04:40:51,134
AN HOUR WINDS. 

8464
04:40:51,134 --> 04:40:53,870
YOU HAVE DOUBLE THAT AT LEAST 

8465
04:40:53,870 --> 04:40:55,705
RIGHT NOW. 

8466
04:40:55,705 --> 04:40:56,606
IN A VERY SMALL AREA. 

8467
04:40:56,606 --> 04:40:57,273
IN TALLAHASSEE, WE THOUGHT THEY 

8468
04:40:57,273 --> 04:40:58,107
MIGHT GET HIT BY THE EYE WALL. 

8469
04:40:58,107 --> 04:40:58,741
THEY WILL DODGE THAT BULLET BY 

8470
04:40:58,741 --> 04:41:00,443
ABOUT 20 MILES SO IT'S A VERY 

8471
04:41:00,443 --> 04:41:01,177
CONFINED AREA. 

8472
04:41:01,177 --> 04:41:02,344
IF YOU ARE IN THE AREA OF THE 

8473
04:41:02,344 --> 04:41:02,945
CENTER OF THAT STORM, THAT'S 

8474
04:41:02,945 --> 04:41:04,046
WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE MOST WIND. 

8475
04:41:04,046 --> 04:41:05,114
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS 

8476
04:41:05,114 --> 04:41:06,616
THOUGH THE STORM SURGES ARE 

8477
04:41:06,616 --> 04:41:08,017
GOING DOWN, WE'RE APPROACHING A 

8478
04:41:08,017 --> 04:41:08,684
HIGH TIDE CYCLE. 

8479
04:41:08,684 --> 04:41:11,387
YOU HAVE TO CONTEND WITH STORM 

8480
04:41:11,387 --> 04:41:13,289
SURGE AND THINGS REALLY DO 

8481
04:41:13,289 --> 04:41:17,360
START IMPROVING. 

8482
04:41:17,360 --> 04:41:17,960
YOU'LL SEE BLUE SKY TOMORROW 

8483
04:41:17,960 --> 04:41:18,661
FOR SURE. 

8484
04:41:18,661 --> 04:41:19,495
>> HAVE YOU SEEN THE LATEST 

8485
04:41:19,495 --> 04:41:20,596
RADAR IMAGES? 

8486
04:41:20,596 --> 04:41:22,899
IS THE EYE PRETTY INTACT? 

8487
04:41:22,899 --> 04:41:23,933
>> IT'S DEFINITELY GETTING LESS 

8488
04:41:23,933 --> 04:41:26,202
INTACT. 

8489
04:41:26,202 --> 04:41:28,037
BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE THAT 

8490
04:41:28,037 --> 04:41:30,306
THE STORM IS HOLDING TOGETHER 

8491
04:41:30,306 --> 04:41:31,841
ITS FIGURE. 

8492
04:41:31,841 --> 04:41:36,713
YOU CAN SEE. 

8493
04:41:36,713 --> 04:41:37,413
>> THAT'S A PRETTY CLEAR EYE. 

8494
04:41:37,413 --> 04:41:38,481
>> AND ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF 

8495
04:41:38,481 --> 04:41:40,249
THE STORM, THE STORM LOOKS TO 

8496
04:41:40,249 --> 04:41:43,453
BE A LITTLE BIT STRONGER IN 

8497
04:41:43,453 --> 04:41:46,389
TERMS OF ITS RAIN BANDS. 

8498
04:41:46,389 --> 04:41:48,057
WHEN YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT THE 

8499
04:41:48,057 --> 04:41:49,392
STRONGEST WINDS USUALLY ON THE 

8500
04:41:49,392 --> 04:41:50,560
RIGHT SIDE OF THE STORM BECAUSE 

8501
04:41:50,560 --> 04:41:51,694
YOU GET TO ADD THE FORWARD 

8502
04:41:51,694 --> 04:41:53,329
PROGRESS OF THE STORM WHICH IS 

8503
04:41:53,329 --> 04:41:54,463
MOVING AT 15 MILES AN HOUR PLUS 

8504
04:41:54,463 --> 04:41:55,731
THE WIND. 

8505
04:41:55,731 --> 04:41:56,899
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS A CLOSE 

8506
04:41:56,899 --> 04:41:57,866
ZOOMED IN RADAR. 

8507
04:41:57,866 --> 04:42:01,804
AND RIGHT ON THE LINE OF 

8508
04:42:01,804 --> 04:42:02,672
GEORGIA AND ALABAMA IS WHERE 

8509
04:42:02,672 --> 04:42:04,607
THE HEAVIEST BANDS ARE NOW. 

8510
04:42:04,607 --> 04:42:09,345
ANOTHER THING TO NOTE, THERE 

8511
04:42:09,345 --> 04:42:10,146
WILL BE PLENTY OF TORNADO 

8512
04:42:10,146 --> 04:42:10,513
WARNINGS. 

8513
04:42:10,513 --> 04:42:12,815
WE HAVE SEEN THEM NEAR 

8514
04:42:12,815 --> 04:42:16,919
JACKSONVILLE, NEAR MACON 

8515
04:42:16,919 --> 04:42:18,287
GEORGIA. 

8516
04:42:18,287 --> 04:42:22,725
THERE'S A TAIL ON THE STORM. 

8517
04:42:22,725 --> 04:42:24,093
THE CHANCE FOR POWER OUTAGES 

8518
04:42:24,093 --> 04:42:28,498
ALL THE WAY UP TOWARD ATLANTA. 

8519
04:42:28,498 --> 04:42:32,035
THEN ALL THE WAY INTO THE 

8520
04:42:32,035 --> 04:42:32,468
CAROLINAS AS WELL. 

8521
04:42:32,468 --> 04:42:33,903
>> DOES THE TAIL BRING WIND? 

8522
04:42:33,903 --> 04:42:34,871
>> SO, THAT LITTLE TAIL OF 

8523
04:42:34,871 --> 04:42:36,105
SEVERE STORMS ESSENTIALLY WHAT 

8524
04:42:36,105 --> 04:42:37,573
HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE WIND MOVING 

8525
04:42:37,573 --> 04:42:38,107
AT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. 

8526
04:42:38,107 --> 04:42:38,708
YOU HAVE ROTATION IN THE 

8527
04:42:38,708 --> 04:42:39,575
ATMOSPHERE BRINGING ABOUT 

8528
04:42:39,575 --> 04:42:39,875
TORNADOES. 

8529
04:42:39,875 --> 04:42:41,043
ON TOP OF THAT, YOU HAVE STRONG 

8530
04:42:41,043 --> 04:42:44,714
STRAIGHT LINE WINDS SO IT'S A 

8531
04:42:44,714 --> 04:42:45,681
BAD COMBINATION OF THE TWO. 

8532
04:42:45,681 --> 04:42:46,416
THEY DON'T LAST VERY LONG 

8533
04:42:46,416 --> 04:42:50,019
NECESSARILY. 

8534
04:42:50,019 --> 04:42:50,653
BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY CAUSE 

8535
04:42:50,653 --> 04:42:51,654
PLENTY OF DAMAGE OR BE DEADLY. 

8536
04:42:51,654 --> 04:42:52,422
SO WHEN EVER YOU'RE UNDER A 

8537
04:42:52,422 --> 04:42:53,022
TORNADO WATCH WHICH THEY ARE 

8538
04:42:53,022 --> 04:42:53,723
UNTIL 2:00 A.M., YOU NEED TO 

8539
04:42:53,723 --> 04:42:56,125
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. 

8540
04:42:56,125 --> 04:42:58,828
THE RAIN, WE'VE SEEN HALF A 

8541
04:42:58,828 --> 04:42:59,696
FOOT OF RAIN WHERE THE STORM 

8542
04:42:59,696 --> 04:43:01,697
MADE LANDFALL. 

8543
04:43:01,697 --> 04:43:03,166
WE WILL SEE LESS RAIN BUT IT IS 

8544
04:43:03,166 --> 04:43:06,536
HAPPENING SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S 

8545
04:43:06,536 --> 04:43:16,379
A FLASH FLOOD CONCERN. 

8546
04:43:16,379 --> 04:43:17,380
>> FLORENCE MOVED SO SLOWLY. 

8547
04:43:17,380 --> 04:43:18,147
MICHAEL SEEMS TO BE SPEEDING 

8548
04:43:18,147 --> 04:43:18,714
ALONG COMPARED TO FLORENCE. 

8549
04:43:18,714 --> 04:43:19,715
>> MICHAEL FEELS LIKE A NORMAL 

8550
04:43:19,715 --> 04:43:20,116
HURRICANE SHOULD. 

8551
04:43:20,116 --> 04:43:20,883
RIGHT? 

8552
04:43:20,883 --> 04:43:22,151
WHICH IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE 

8553
04:43:22,151 --> 04:43:22,785
ANY SORT OF ATMOSPHERIC 

8554
04:43:22,785 --> 04:43:24,053
BLOCKING OR SOMETHING GUMMING 

8555
04:43:24,053 --> 04:43:24,687
UP THE WORKS OF FORWARD 

8556
04:43:24,687 --> 04:43:25,621
PROGRESS, THIS IS AROUND THE 

8557
04:43:25,621 --> 04:43:26,389
SPEED THAT YOU WOULD GET. 

8558
04:43:26,389 --> 04:43:29,091
10 TO 20 MILES AN HOUR RANGE. 

8559
04:43:29,091 --> 04:43:43,206
>> SO IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FAST?  

8560
04:43:43,206 --> 04:43:44,707
>>> RIGHT NOW, FLORIDA GOVERNOR 

8561
04:43:44,707 --> 04:43:46,309
RICK SCOTT AND OTHER OFFICIALS 

8562
04:43:46,309 --> 04:43:49,511
ARE GIVING AN UPDATE ON 

8563
04:43:49,511 --> 04:43:52,914
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

8564
04:43:52,914 --> 04:43:54,617
>> A EMERGENCY DECLARATION TO 

8565
04:43:54,617 --> 04:43:56,352
ALLOW RESOURCES TO FLOW INTO 

8566
04:43:56,352 --> 04:43:56,919
THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. 

8567
04:43:56,919 --> 04:43:58,087
I SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 

8568
04:43:58,087 --> 04:43:59,455
HE IS COMMITTED TO MAKING EVERY 

8569
04:43:59,455 --> 04:44:02,158
FEDERAL RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO 

8570
04:44:02,158 --> 04:44:02,591
HELP THE RECOVERY. 

8571
04:44:02,591 --> 04:44:04,160
HURRICANE MICHAEL IS THE WORST 

8572
04:44:04,160 --> 04:44:05,261
STORM THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE HAS 

8573
04:44:05,261 --> 04:44:06,762
EVER SEEN AND ONE OF THE WORST 

8574
04:44:06,762 --> 04:44:09,165
POWERED STORMS TO MAKE LANDFALL 

8575
04:44:09,165 --> 04:44:11,700
IN THE UNITED STATES. 

8576
04:44:11,700 --> 04:44:13,869
WE HEARD OF SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS 

8577
04:44:13,869 --> 04:44:15,705
AT TINDEL AIR FORCE BASE AND 

8578
04:44:15,705 --> 04:44:16,973
MANY COMMUNITIES ALONG THE 

8579
04:44:16,973 --> 04:44:17,206
COAST. 

8580
04:44:17,206 --> 04:44:17,974
AS HURRICANE MICHAEL CONTINUES 

8581
04:44:17,974 --> 04:44:19,609
ITS DESTRUCTIVE PATH THROUGH 

8582
04:44:19,609 --> 04:44:21,611
THE PANHANDLE AND LEAVES OUR 

8583
04:44:21,611 --> 04:44:23,279
STATE, WE ARE TURNING 100% OF 

8584
04:44:23,279 --> 04:44:26,282
OUR FOCUS ON SEARCH AND RESCUE 

8585
04:44:26,282 --> 04:44:26,715
AND RECOVERY. 

8586
04:44:26,715 --> 04:44:29,919
BUT, WE NEED EVERY FAMILY TO 

8587
04:44:29,919 --> 04:44:30,753
HELP WITH THIS. 

8588
04:44:30,753 --> 04:44:32,154
LISTEN TO LOCAL OFFICIALS. 

8589
04:44:32,154 --> 04:44:35,558
WE COULD STILL HAVE FLASH 

8590
04:44:35,558 --> 04:44:36,559
FLOODING AND TORNADOES. 

8591
04:44:36,559 --> 04:44:38,961
WE HEARD OF TWO DEVASTATING 

8592
04:44:38,961 --> 04:44:41,196
TORNADOES IN GASTON COUNTY. 

8593
04:44:41,196 --> 04:44:42,732
THE WEATHER IS STILL EXTREMELY 

8594
04:44:42,732 --> 04:44:43,866
DANGEROUS. 

8595
04:44:43,866 --> 04:44:45,368
DO NOT TAKE A RISK. 

8596
04:44:45,368 --> 04:44:45,635
BE SAFE. 

8597
04:44:45,635 --> 04:44:48,437
WE ALSO NEED PEOPLE TO BE VERY 

8598
04:44:48,437 --> 04:44:49,238
SAFE WITH GENERATORS. 

8599
04:44:49,238 --> 04:44:52,241
DO NOT PUT A RUNNING GENERATOR 

8600
04:44:52,241 --> 04:44:53,409
IN YOUR HOME. 

8601
04:44:53,409 --> 04:44:53,843
IT IS NOT SAFE. 

8602
04:44:53,843 --> 04:44:55,878
DO NOT GET OUT ON THE ROADS 

8603
04:44:55,878 --> 04:44:56,879
UNTIL YOU'RE TOLD IT IS SAFE. 

8604
04:44:56,879 --> 04:44:59,749
WE NEED THE ROAD TO BE OPEN FOR 

8605
04:44:59,749 --> 04:45:00,383
FIRST RESPONDERS, AND SEARCH 

8606
04:45:00,383 --> 04:45:04,186
AND RESCUE TO DO THEIR JOBS. 

8607
04:45:04,186 --> 04:45:04,619
AND SAVE LIVES. 

8608
04:45:04,619 --> 04:45:07,557
IF IT IS NOT SAFE TO LEAVE YOUR 

8609
04:45:07,557 --> 04:45:08,057
HOUSE, DON'T LEAVE IT. 

8610
04:45:08,057 --> 04:45:09,559
IF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MADE IT 

8611
04:45:09,559 --> 04:45:10,560
THROUGH THE STORM SAFELY, THE 

8612
04:45:10,560 --> 04:45:13,563
WORST THING YOU CAN DO NOW IS 

8613
04:45:13,563 --> 04:45:14,664
TO ACT FOOLISHLY AND PUT 

8614
04:45:14,664 --> 04:45:17,667
YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY IN 

8615
04:45:17,667 --> 04:45:21,537
DANGER OR KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT 

8616
04:45:21,537 --> 04:45:23,439
AND RESCUE WORKERS FROM SAVING 

8617
04:45:23,439 --> 04:45:23,672
LIVES. 

8618
04:45:23,672 --> 04:45:25,041
OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND LAW 

8619
04:45:25,041 --> 04:45:27,743
ENFORCEMENT ARE HEROS LEAVING 

8620
04:45:27,743 --> 04:45:28,677
THEIR FAMILY TO HELP OTHERS. 

8621
04:45:28,677 --> 04:45:29,712
WE CANNOT THANK THEM ENOUGH. 

8622
04:45:29,712 --> 04:45:32,682
AS I SAID EARLIER TODAY, WE ARE 

8623
04:45:32,682 --> 04:45:34,283
DEPLOYING A MASSIVE WAVE OF 

8624
04:45:34,283 --> 04:45:34,550
RESPONSE. 

8625
04:45:34,550 --> 04:45:37,086
WE'LL BE SENDING AIR FROM AIR, 

8626
04:45:37,086 --> 04:45:38,187
LAND, AND SEA. 

8627
04:45:38,187 --> 04:45:40,890
THIS INCLUDES THOUSANDS OF 

8628
04:45:40,890 --> 04:45:43,392
RESPONDERS FOR POWER 

8629
04:45:43,392 --> 04:45:43,725
RESTORATION. 

8630
04:45:43,725 --> 04:45:46,228
MEDICAL SEARCH AND RESCUE. 

8631
04:45:46,228 --> 04:45:52,702
LAW ENFORCEMENT, FOOD AND WATER 

8632
04:45:52,702 --> 04:45:53,035

AND EVERY OTHER CRITICAL 

8634

8635
04:45:54,603 --> 04:45:57,039
I WAS BRIEFED BY THE COAST 

8636
04:45:57,039 --> 04:45:58,541

8639
04:46:00,576 --> 04:46:03,579
ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF RESCUE 

8640
04:46:03,579 --> 04:46:05,915

8641
04:46:05,915 --> 04:46:08,017
1800 PERSONNEL READY TO DEPLOY 

8642
04:46:08,017 --> 04:46:08,284
LOCALLY. 

8643
04:46:08,284 --> 04:46:09,886
RIGHT NOW, UTILITIES ARE

8645

HOMES AND BUSINESSES WITHOUT

POWER. 

8647
04:46:13,088 --> 04:46:14,890
WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATED NUMBER

SO, LET'S ALL STAY SAFE. 

8651
04:46:19,295 --> 04:46:20,396
STAY ALERT TO WEATHER UPDATES 

8652
04:46:20,396 --> 04:46:22,331

8653
04:46:22,331 --> 04:46:22,899
THROUGH THE NIGHT. 

8654
04:46:22,899 --> 04:46:26,002
THE ENTIRE NATION AND WORLD 

8655
04:46:26,002 --> 04:46:28,337
HAVE WATCHED THIS MONSTER STORM 

8656
04:46:28,337 --> 04:46:30,439
AS IT DEVASTATED OUR GULF COAST 

8657
04:46:30,439 --> 04:46:31,374
AND PANHANDLE. 

8658
04:46:31,374 --> 04:46:32,975
THE LOVE AND SUPPORT WE HAVE 

8659
04:46:32,975 --> 04:46:34,676
RECEIVED FROM SO MANY IS 

8660
04:46:34,676 --> 04:46:36,279
OVERWHELMING AND WE ARE

BEEN OFFERED. 

8664
04:46:40,383 --> 04:46:41,984
ON BEHALF OF THE GULF COAST, I 

8665
04:46:41,984 --> 04:46:46,088
WANT TO THANK THE NATION FOR 

8666

8667
04:46:49,057 --> 04:46:50,259
FOLLOWING THE STORM, WE MUST

WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS 

8676
04:47:07,076 --> 04:47:07,342
TOGETHER. 

8677
04:47:07,342 --> 04:47:10,012

>> WE ARE SENDING THEM OUT. 

8700
04:48:06,435 --> 04:48:07,403
THEY STARTED OUT ALREADY. 

8701
04:48:07,403 --> 04:48:09,205
SO, WE'LL HAVE, YOU KNOW, I 

8702
04:48:09,205 --> 04:48:10,606
THINK WE TALKED ABOUT IT 

8703
04:48:10,606 --> 04:48:10,973
EARLIER. 

8704
04:48:10,973 --> 04:48:11,807
WE HAVE SEARCH AND RESCUE

8706
04:48:13,309 --> 04:48:13,976
TOWARD THE COAST. 

8707
04:48:13,976 --> 04:48:16,245
AND WE HAVE THE COAST GUARD 

8708
04:48:16,245 --> 04:48:17,613
COMING FROM THE TAMPA AREA. 

8709
04:48:17,613 --> 04:48:20,416
I THINK THEY'RE IN CLEAR WATER.

04:48:20,416 --> 04:48:20,849
AND, FROM ALABAMA. 

8711
04:48:20,849 --> 04:48:22,318

WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT REGIONS.

04:48:39,668 --> 04:48:45,908
IT WILL BE COMING DOWN SO THEY 

8722
04:48:45,908 --> 04:48:46,509
WILL MEET UP. 

8723

8725
04:48:49,344 --> 04:48:49,712
PROBLEMS. 

8726
04:48:49,712 --> 04:48:50,346
BIG COUNTIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT 

8727

WE HAVE ALREADY SENT TEAMS 

8731
04:48:57,920 --> 04:48:58,320
ALREADY STARTING. 

8732
04:48:58,320 --> 04:49:00,055
>> THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT 

8733
04:49:00,055 --> 04:49:02,057
LOCAL READINESS BASED ON YOU 

8734
04:49:02,057 --> 04:49:02,257

8735
04:49:02,257 --> 04:49:04,827
DO YOU ANY THEY WERE PREPARED 

8736
04:49:04,827 --> 04:49:05,928
FOR THE STORM? 

8737
04:49:05,928 --> 04:49:09,231

FAST. 

8739
04:49:09,431 --> 04:49:10,599
EVERYBODY DIDN'T EVACUATE. 

8740
04:49:10,599 --> 04:49:13,135
I'M STILL PRAYING WE DIDN'T 

8741
04:49:13,135 --> 04:49:14,136
LOSE EVERYBODY THAT WAS 

8742
04:49:14,136 --> 04:49:17,006
DISAPPOINTING TO ME THAT 

8743
04:49:17,006 --> 04:49:17,573
EVERYBODY DIDN'T EVACUATE. 

8744
04:49:17,573 --> 04:49:22,011
YOU KNOW, I THINK IN EVERY 

8745
04:49:22,011 --> 04:49:24,447
STORM, YOU HAVE TO ASSESS AFTER 

8746
04:49:24,447 --> 04:49:24,847
YOU GET FINISHED. 

8747
04:49:24,847 --> 04:49:29,552
I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DO IT 

8748
04:49:29,552 --> 04:49:30,152
LOCALLY, FEDERAL, AND STATE. 

8749
04:49:30,152 --> 04:49:34,557
WE'LL SEE OVER TIME IF PEOPLE 

8750
04:49:34,557 --> 04:49:35,057
WERE READY. 

8751
04:49:35,057 --> 04:49:37,359
THIS WAS A BIG STORM. 

8752
04:49:37,359 --> 04:49:39,362
YOU HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THE 

8753
04:49:39,362 --> 04:49:42,230
VIDEOS THAT ARE OUT THERE. 

8754
04:49:42,230 --> 04:49:45,334
THIS WAS A BIG STORM. 

8755
04:49:45,334 --> 04:49:46,001
AND, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE 

8756
04:49:46,001 --> 04:49:47,436
IN SOME PLACES. 

8757
04:49:47,436 --> 04:49:48,637
WE'LL FIND OUT OVER TIME. 

8758
04:49:48,637 --> 04:49:51,841
>> WE'LL TAKE ONE MORE 

8759
04:49:51,841 --> 04:49:52,408
QUESTION. 

8760
04:49:52,408 --> 04:49:53,609
GOVERNOR, THERE ARE SEVERAL 

8761
04:49:53,609 --> 04:50:00,449

8768
04:50:11,861 --> 04:50:12,761

INTACT AND THERE'S BEEN NO 

8774
04:50:20,669 --> 04:50:20,902

8778
04:50:26,208 --> 04:50:27,910
WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD SO FAR HAS 

8779
04:50:27,910 --> 04:50:33,149
BEEN SOME ROOF DAMAGE. 

8780
04:50:33,149 --> 04:50:34,183
SO WE'RE SENDING TEAMS TO MAKE 

8781
04:50:34,183 --> 04:50:35,551

8784
04:50:38,287 --> 04:50:38,754
THAT THEY'RE NOT. 

8785
04:50:38,754 --> 04:50:44,860
I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS SOME 

8786
04:50:44,860 --> 04:50:45,894
DAMAGE IN SOME ROOFS. 

8787
04:50:45,894 --> 04:50:47,162
AS YOU CAN EXPECT, THERE'S A 

8788
04:50:47,162 --> 04:50:47,362
LOT. 

8789
04:50:47,362 --> 04:50:48,464
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATH, 

8790
04:50:48,464 --> 04:50:55,871
THERE'S A LOT OF ROOF DAMAGE IN 

8791
04:50:55,871 --> 04:50:56,438
THAT PATH. 

8792
04:50:56,438 --> 04:50:58,541
SO, THE BIG THING NOW IS WE'RE 

8793
04:50:58,541 --> 04:50:59,542
GETTING FEEDBACK. 

8794
04:50:59,542 --> 04:51:02,044
WHERE WE HAVE PROBLEMS, WE'RE 

8795
04:51:02,044 --> 04:51:07,583
SENDING SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS 

8796
04:51:07,583 --> 04:51:08,350
RIGHT AWAY. 

8797
04:51:08,350 --> 04:51:09,151
PEOPLE ARE VERY AGGRESSIVELY 

8798
04:51:09,151 --> 04:51:12,254
GETTING OUT THERE TO ASSESS THE 

8799
04:51:12,254 --> 04:51:13,521
DAMAGE AND PROVIDE ANY 

8800
04:51:13,521 --> 04:51:16,024
RESOURCES ANYBODY NEEDS. 

8801
04:51:16,024 --> 04:51:18,160
>> THANKS GUYS. 

8802
04:51:18,160 --> 04:51:25,868
>> THANKS EVERYBODY. 

8803
04:51:25,868 --> 04:51:27,636
>>> WE JUST HEARD FLORIDA 

8804
04:51:27,636 --> 04:51:28,938
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT GIVING US 

8805
04:51:28,938 --> 04:51:31,740
AN UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF 

8806
04:51:31,740 --> 04:51:32,374
HURRICANE MICHAEL THERE. 

8807
04:51:32,374 --> 04:51:37,379
HE SAID 100% OF THE FOCUS IS 

8808
04:51:37,379 --> 04:51:39,414
NOW ON SEARCH AND RESCUE. 

8809
04:51:39,414 --> 04:51:42,117
HE DID WARN PEOPLE THERE TO 

8810
04:51:42,117 --> 04:51:42,717
REMAIN SHELTERED IN PLACE. 

8811
04:51:42,717 --> 04:51:43,786
HE SAYS FLASH FLOODING AND 

8812
04:51:43,786 --> 04:51:46,288
TORNADOES ARE STILL A DANGER TO 

8813
04:51:46,288 --> 04:51:46,822
THE REGION. 

8814
04:51:46,822 --> 04:51:48,991
THERE ARE NO CONFIRMED REPORTS 

8815
04:51:48,991 --> 04:51:50,759
OF FATALITIES AT THIS POINT 

8816
04:51:50,759 --> 04:51:51,459
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR. 

8817
04:51:51,459 --> 04:51:58,067
WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO COVERAGE 

8818
04:51:58,067 --> 04:51:59,267
FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE, 

8819
04:51:59,267 --> 04:51:59,634
WCTV FOR MORE. 

8820
04:51:59,634 --> 04:52:02,137
>> ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT 

8821
04:52:02,137 --> 04:52:06,542
MY HAIRCUT IS I DON'T 

8822
04:52:06,542 --> 04:52:08,844
NECESSARILY NEED A HOOD. 

8823
04:52:08,844 --> 04:52:10,679
I DID NEED THE RAIN GEAR, WE 

8824
04:52:10,679 --> 04:52:14,883
ARE IN A BREAK FROM THE RAKE. 

8825
04:52:14,883 --> 04:52:16,285
WE'RE IN AZALEA PARK. 

8826
04:52:16,285 --> 04:52:17,820
EARLIER, WE SHOWED YOU THIS 

8827
04:52:17,820 --> 04:52:19,788
JUNGLE GYM STRUCTURE THAT 

8828
04:52:19,788 --> 04:52:20,890
LOOKED BLOWN OVER. 

8829
04:52:20,890 --> 04:52:22,090
WE DID SOME FURTHER INSPECTION. 

8830
04:52:22,090 --> 04:52:23,993
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS JUST 

8831
04:52:23,993 --> 04:52:24,827
CONSTRUCTED THAT WAY. 

8832
04:52:24,827 --> 04:52:29,565
I PULLED SEVERAL MUSCLES JUST 

8833
04:52:29,565 --> 04:52:31,767
LOOKING  AT IT BUT I DON'T WANT 

8834
04:52:31,767 --> 04:52:33,268
TO MISLEAD ANYBODY OUT THERE. 

8835
04:52:33,268 --> 04:52:37,039
YOU CAN SEE THE DAMAGE IN 

8836
04:52:37,039 --> 04:52:38,040
AZALEA PARK. 

8837
04:52:38,040 --> 04:52:43,178
YOU SEE A LAW ENFORCEMENT 

8838
04:52:43,178 --> 04:52:45,514
VEHICLE ACROSS THE STREET. 

8839
04:52:45,514 --> 04:52:47,082
THIS TREE RIGHT HERE, TOPPLED, 

8840
04:52:47,082 --> 04:52:48,617
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. 

8841
04:52:48,617 --> 04:52:50,085
THERE ARE THE ROOTS. 

8842
04:52:50,085 --> 04:52:51,019
THERE'S THE TRUNK. 

8843
04:52:51,019 --> 04:52:54,490
IT'S NOT A BIG TREE. 

8844
04:52:54,490 --> 04:52:55,023
BY ANY MEANS. 

8845
04:52:55,023 --> 04:52:57,259
BUT YOU'RE SEEING SOME OF THE 

8846
04:52:57,259 --> 04:53:00,195
DAMAGE, SOME OF THE DEBRIS THEY 

8847
04:53:00,195 --> 04:53:00,695
ARE EXPERIENCING HERE. 

8848
04:53:00,695 --> 04:53:03,699
WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH A WALK 

8849
04:53:03,699 --> 04:53:08,670
IN THIS PARK. 

8850
04:53:08,670 --> 04:53:09,437
A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. 

8851
04:53:09,437 --> 04:53:11,473
RIGHT OFF THE ROAD, YOU SEE 

8852
04:53:11,473 --> 04:53:12,041
BRANCHES. 

8853
04:53:12,041 --> 04:53:16,478
YOU SEE MORE DEBRIS ON THE 

8854
04:53:16,478 --> 04:53:16,711
GROUND. 

8855
04:53:16,711 --> 04:53:18,514
THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE 

8856
04:53:18,514 --> 04:53:18,847
BEEN SEEING. 

8857
04:53:18,847 --> 04:53:22,184
WE HAVE BEEN GOING IN AND OUT 

8858
04:53:22,184 --> 04:53:22,985
TRYING TO STAY SAFE. 

8859
04:53:22,985 --> 04:53:24,720
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BREAK OUR 

8860
04:53:24,720 --> 04:53:25,821
OWN RULES, JUST TRYING TO GIVE 

8861
04:53:25,821 --> 04:53:30,092
PEOPLE AN IDEA OF WHAT THIS 

8862
04:53:30,092 --> 04:53:31,927
STORM HAS CAUSED HERE. 

8863
04:53:31,927 --> 04:53:37,198
AT ABOUT 1:00 I WANT TO SAY, WE 

8864
04:53:37,198 --> 04:53:40,168
WERE IN PANACEA. 

8865
04:53:40,168 --> 04:53:42,871
WE WERE AT MAD ANTHONY'S AND WE 

8866
04:53:42,871 --> 04:53:43,538
SAW THE WATER COMING UP. 

8867
04:53:43,538 --> 04:53:46,041
THE STORM SURGE WAS TO THE 

8868
04:53:46,041 --> 04:53:46,708
POINT WHERE THE SHERIFF 

8869
04:53:46,708 --> 04:53:50,412
DEPUTIES SAID THAT WE NEEDED TO 

8870
04:53:50,412 --> 04:53:51,914
LEAVE THAT AREA BECAUSE THEY 

8871
04:53:51,914 --> 04:53:53,415
WERE WORRIED THE WATER WAS 

8872
04:53:53,415 --> 04:53:55,317
GOING TO GO ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. 

8873
04:53:55,317 --> 04:53:57,119
THE GOAL IS TO MOVE DOWN THAT 

8874
04:53:57,119 --> 04:53:57,419
WAY. 

8875
04:53:57,419 --> 04:54:01,123
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SAFER TO DO 

8876
04:54:01,123 --> 04:54:01,323
SO. 

8877
04:54:01,323 --> 04:54:03,092
SO RIGHT NOW ON CRAWFORDVILLE, 

8878
04:54:03,092 --> 04:54:04,860
YOU HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE. 

8879
04:54:04,860 --> 04:54:05,994
A LOT OF LIMBS DOWN. 

8880
04:54:05,994 --> 04:54:07,629
WE HAVE SEEN SOME BIGGER TREES 

8881
04:54:07,629 --> 04:54:07,896
DOWN. 

8882
04:54:07,896 --> 04:54:09,665
BUT WE'RE NOW GOING TO TRY TO 

8883
04:54:09,665 --> 04:54:14,870
MAKE OUR WAY TOWARD THE COAST 

8884
04:54:14,870 --> 04:54:16,672
TO BRING YOU A BETTER PICTURE 

8885
04:54:16,672 --> 04:54:17,772
OF WHAT'S GOING ON. 

8886
04:54:17,772 --> 04:54:18,073
STAY SAFE. 

8887
04:54:18,073 --> 04:54:19,641
THERE'S MORE TRAFFIC ON THE 

8888
04:54:19,641 --> 04:54:19,875
ROADS. 

8889
04:54:19,875 --> 04:54:21,910
DO NOT BE OUT ON THE ROADS. 

8890
04:54:21,910 --> 04:54:24,613
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO STAY INSIDE, 

8891
04:54:24,613 --> 04:54:25,714
HUNKER DOWN, DO SO. 

8892
04:54:25,714 --> 04:54:27,116
THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS 

8893
04:54:27,116 --> 04:54:27,716
TELLING EVERYONE TO DO. 

8894
04:54:27,716 --> 04:54:29,618
AS LONG AS THE STORM CONTINUE 

8895
04:54:29,618 --> 04:54:31,020
TO BE A THREAT, YOU WANT TO 

8896
04:54:31,020 --> 04:54:32,721
MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING THE BEST 

8897
04:54:32,721 --> 04:54:34,189
YOU CAN TO STAY SAFE. 

8898
04:54:34,189 --> 04:54:35,557
WE'LL DO THE SAME THING. 

8899
04:54:35,557 --> 04:54:39,528
BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET CLOSER 

8900
04:54:39,528 --> 04:54:44,599
TO THE COASTLINE, WE'LL DO SO. 

8901
04:54:44,599 --> 04:54:45,834

WITH MORE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING 

8909
04:54:53,675 --> 04:54:56,645
DOWN BY THE COAST. 

8910
04:54:56,645 --> 04:54:58,213
>> AND WE'RE ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW 

8911
04:54:58,213 --> 04:55:04,886
OUR NEIGHBORS ARE DOING BY THE 

8912
04:55:04,886 --> 04:55:05,220
COAST. 

8913
04:55:05,220 --> 04:55:07,122
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT, THIS 

8914
04:55:07,122 --> 04:55:09,892
STORM IS FAR FROM OVER. 

8915
04:55:09,892 --> 04:55:10,359
IT'S RAINING, WINDY. 

8916
04:55:10,359 --> 04:55:13,328

63 MILES AN HOUR WIND GUST IN 

8919
04:55:17,533 --> 04:55:17,866
TALLAHASSEE. 

8920
04:55:17,866 --> 04:55:22,704
SO IT IS STILL VERY MUCH HERE 

8921
04:55:22,704 --> 04:55:23,171
AND VERY DANGEROUS. 

8922
04:55:23,171 --> 04:55:27,609
>> MOVING NORTH AND EAST 

8923
04:55:27,609 --> 04:55:29,744
THROUGH SOUTHWEST GEORGIA WHERE 

8924
04:55:29,744 --> 04:55:32,648
KEVIN KEENE HAS BEEN RIDING OUT 

8925
04:55:32,648 --> 04:55:34,183
THE STORM. 

8926
04:55:34,183 --> 04:55:35,117
HE FILES THIS REPORT. 

8927
04:55:35,117 --> 04:55:36,552

HURRICANE MICHAEL FELT, SEEN,

AND HEARD MORE NOW AS THE STORM 

8931
04:55:41,723 --> 04:55:42,825
CREEPS CLOSER AND CLOSER. 

8932
04:55:42,825 --> 04:55:45,661
THE MIDDLE OF THE STORM CREEPS 

8933
04:55:45,661 --> 04:55:46,728
CLOSER TO SOUTH GEORGIA. 

8934
04:55:46,728 --> 04:55:49,097
RIGHT NOW, THE WIND PICKING UP. 

8935
04:55:49,097 --> 04:55:51,733
IT IS RAINING IN SHEETS HEAVIER 

8936
04:55:51,733 --> 04:55:57,906
THAN IT WAS 30 TO 45 MINUTES 

8937
04:55:57,906 --> 04:55:58,173
AGO. 

8938
04:55:58,173 --> 04:55:59,908
YOU CAN HEAR SEVERAL TREES 

8939
04:55:59,908 --> 04:56:01,076
SNAPPING BEHIND ME. 

8940
04:56:01,076 --> 04:56:05,647
NOT EVEN A QUARTER MILE AWAY. 

8941
04:56:05,647 --> 04:56:06,949
JUST SNAPPING, LIMBS FALLING 

8942
04:56:06,949 --> 04:56:08,750
ONTO THE ROAD. 

8943
04:56:08,750 --> 04:56:11,653
FURTHER THAN WE FELT SAFE TO 

8944
04:56:11,653 --> 04:56:14,156
GO, A TREE FELL ON THE POWER 

8945
04:56:14,156 --> 04:56:18,761
LINES THAT CONNECT HERE TO THE 

8946
04:56:18,761 --> 04:56:19,561
WORSHIP CENTER THEY SPOKE TO 

8947
04:56:19,561 --> 04:56:21,163
THE POWER COMPANY NOT TOO LONG 

8948
04:56:21,163 --> 04:56:21,363
AGO. 

8949
04:56:21,363 --> 04:56:24,366
THEY DON'T EXPECT TO GET POWER 

8950
04:56:24,366 --> 04:56:27,836
RESTORED TO THIS FACILITY FOR 

8951
04:56:27,836 --> 04:56:31,139
AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 HOURS. 

8952
04:56:31,139 --> 04:56:32,808
THEY ARE URGING EVERYONE TO 

8953
04:56:32,808 --> 04:56:34,675
STAY SAFE IN SOUTH GEORGIA. 

8954
04:56:34,675 --> 04:56:34,976
EVERYWHERE. 

8955
04:56:34,976 --> 04:56:39,047
BUT THE STORM MAKING ITS WAY 

8956
04:56:39,047 --> 04:56:39,481
THIS WAY. 

8957
04:56:39,481 --> 04:56:41,183
CERTAINLY COST GETTING MORE 

8958
04:56:41,183 --> 04:56:42,484
POWERFUL BY THE MINUTE. 

8959
04:56:42,484 --> 04:56:43,986
WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER UPDATE FOR 

8960
04:56:43,986 --> 04:56:45,554
YOU IN JUST A BIT. 

8961
04:56:45,554 --> 04:56:46,254
>> KEVIN, THANK YOU. 

8962
04:56:46,254 --> 04:56:49,958
AS YOU SAID, IT'S NOT OVER YET. 

8963
04:56:49,958 --> 04:56:50,225

WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE OUT. 

9056
05:00:01,416 --> 05:00:02,117
IT'S NOT OVER YET. 

9057

LOOKS LIKE THE MOST INTENSE 

9060
05:00:06,021 --> 05:00:06,421
PART HAS PASSED. 

9061
05:00:06,421 --> 05:00:08,824
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT TO GO 

9062
05:00:08,824 --> 05:00:09,157
THROUGH THIS. 

9063
05:00:09,157 --> 05:00:10,525
TAKE THAT, PLUS NIGHTFALL WILL 

9064
05:00:10,525 --> 05:00:11,026
BE UPON US SOON. 

9065
05:00:11,026 --> 05:00:14,896
WE DON'T WANT TO LET OUR GUARD 

9066
05:00:14,896 --> 05:00:15,096

9067
05:00:15,096 --> 05:00:19,634
WE DON'T WANT TO GET OUT AFTER 

9068
05:00:19,634 --> 05:00:20,202
THE SUN HAS SET. 

9069
05:00:20,202 --> 05:00:22,571

SUN GOES DOWN. 

9073
05:00:25,807 --> 05:00:26,875
WE'RE GETTING NEAR THAT TIME. 

9074
05:00:26,875 --> 05:00:28,777
AND JUST WITH THE STORM ITSELF, 

9075
05:00:28,777 --> 05:00:32,114
IT MAKES IT ALREADY DARK 

9076
05:00:32,114 --> 05:00:32,381
OUTSIDE. 

9077
05:00:32,381 --> 05:00:33,915
SO, AGAIN, STAY IN YOUR HOME. 

9078
05:00:33,915 --> 05:00:35,517
STAY IN THE SHELTER IF THAT'S

WHERE YOU'RE AT. 

9080
05:00:35,950 --> 05:00:37,919
LET THE CREWS DO THEIR JOBS. 

9081
05:00:37,919 --> 05:00:39,754

AS CREWS ARE OUT THERE. 

9086
05:00:44,459 --> 05:00:46,128
ABLE TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT 

9087
05:00:46,128 --> 05:00:47,629
WHICH POWER LINES ARE DOWN. 

9088
05:00:47,629 --> 05:00:48,430
WHICH TREES ARE DOWN AND START 

9089
05:00:48,430 --> 05:00:50,532
TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE 

9090
05:00:50,532 --> 05:00:52,033
DEBRIS AND START CUTTING 

9091
05:00:52,033 --> 05:00:54,269
THROUGH IT AND MAKE SURE THE 

9092
05:00:54,269 --> 05:00:55,403
ROADWAYS ARE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO 

9093
05:00:55,403 --> 05:00:57,973

YOU CAN'T GET THEM ALL AT ONCE. 

9107
05:01:19,327 --> 05:01:20,629
PEOPLE SHOULD TRY TO STAY IN

9109
05:01:22,197 --> 05:01:26,935

9119
05:01:36,077 --> 05:01:37,712
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE, YOU CAN'T

9144
05:02:26,461 --> 05:02:26,962
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

9145
05:02:26,962 --> 05:02:28,863
THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY ROUGH 

9146
05:02:28,863 --> 05:02:29,264
DAY. 

9147
05:02:29,264 --> 05:02:29,864
WHAT'S AHEAD FOR US NOW? 

9148
05:02:29,864 --> 05:02:32,067
>> WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OVER THE 

9149
05:02:32,067 --> 05:02:33,134
HUMP. 

9150
05:02:33,134 --> 05:02:33,969
CONDITIONS ARE STARTING TO 

9151
05:02:33,969 --> 05:02:34,369
RAPIDLY IMPROVE. 

9152
05:02:34,369 --> 05:02:36,638
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE WITH IT YET. 

9153
05:02:36,638 --> 05:02:38,173
CERTAINLY THE WORST OF IT NOW 

9154
05:02:38,173 --> 05:02:39,908
IS GETTING WEAKER BUT IT'S 

9155
05:02:39,908 --> 05:02:41,710
STILL A STRONG SYSTEM MOVING 

9156
05:02:41,710 --> 05:02:42,811
THROUGH PARTS OF SOUTHWEST 

9157
05:02:42,811 --> 05:02:43,211
GEORGIA. 

9158
05:02:43,211 --> 05:02:46,081
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE CENTER CAME 

9159
05:02:46,081 --> 05:02:47,649
ASHORE BETWEEN PANAMA CITY AND 

9160
05:02:47,649 --> 05:02:51,553
JUST TO THE NORTHWEST OF MEXICO 

9161
05:02:51,553 --> 05:02:51,853
BEACH. 

9162
05:02:51,853 --> 05:02:53,855
MOVED ON THROUGH CALHOUN COUNTY 

9163
05:02:53,855 --> 05:02:54,723
AND JACKSON COUNTY. 

9164
05:02:54,723 --> 05:02:56,057
AND SEMINOLE COUNTY. 

9165
05:02:56,057 --> 05:03:00,629
NOW MOVING THROUGH MILLER 

9166
05:03:00,629 --> 05:03:00,862
COUNTY. 

9167
05:03:00,862 --> 05:03:01,296
THAT'S THE CENTER. 

9168
05:03:01,296 --> 05:03:06,268
AS YOU CAN TELL, IT'S A LARGE 

9169
05:03:06,268 --> 05:03:06,501
SYSTEM. 

9170
05:03:06,501 --> 05:03:09,938
WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT 

9171
05:03:09,938 --> 05:03:12,841
IMPACTS, CREST VIEW, ALL THE 

9172
05:03:12,841 --> 05:03:16,110
WAY TO MONTICELLO. 

9173
05:03:16,110 --> 05:03:17,445
YOU HAVE HAD BREEZY CONDITIONS. 

9174
05:03:17,445 --> 05:03:20,481
BUT ASIDE FROM GUSTS IS REALLY 

9175
05:03:20,481 --> 05:03:20,915
AS EXPECTED THERE. 

9176
05:03:20,915 --> 05:03:23,952
LET'S LOOK A LITTLE MORE 

9177
05:03:23,952 --> 05:03:25,387
CLOSELY ON THE INFRARED 

9178
05:03:25,387 --> 05:03:25,754
SATELLITE VIEW. 

9179
05:03:25,754 --> 05:03:28,056
WATCH HOW THE EYE KIND OF FILLS 

9180
05:03:28,056 --> 05:03:28,356
IN. 

9181
05:03:28,356 --> 05:03:31,092
AND THE COLORIZED VERSION OF 

9182
05:03:31,092 --> 05:03:33,261
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. 

9183
05:03:33,261 --> 05:03:36,865
YOU CAN WATCH HOW THAT CENTER, 

9184
05:03:36,865 --> 05:03:38,933
SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE EYE 

9185
05:03:38,933 --> 05:03:40,969
WALL THAT WAS SURROUNDING THAT 

9186
05:03:40,969 --> 05:03:41,269
EYE. 

9187
05:03:41,269 --> 05:03:45,640
AND NOW, HOW THAT IS GETTING 

9188
05:03:45,640 --> 05:03:46,073
WEAKER AND WEAKER. 

9189
05:03:46,073 --> 05:03:48,143
THE HIGHER CLOUD TOPS, ARE 

9190
05:03:48,143 --> 05:03:49,044
COLDER. 

9191
05:03:49,044 --> 05:03:51,479
THAT'S THE WAY SATELLITE, THIS 

9192
05:03:51,479 --> 05:03:54,082
INFRARED SATELLITE WORKS. 

9193
05:03:54,082 --> 05:03:56,951
WHERE YOU SEE THE DEEP REDS, 

9194
05:03:56,951 --> 05:03:59,554
YOU HAVE THE INTENSE RAIN 

9195
05:03:59,554 --> 05:03:59,787
BANDS. 

9196
05:03:59,787 --> 05:04:04,159
ONE OF THOSE THOUGH IT IS NOW 

9197
05:04:04,159 --> 05:04:06,594
70 MILES FROM THE CENTER, IT 

9198
05:04:06,594 --> 05:04:07,362
STILL PRODUCED WIND GUSTS TO 60 

9199
05:04:07,362 --> 05:04:09,164
MILES AN HOUR THROUGH PARTS OF 

9200
05:04:09,164 --> 05:04:09,697
LEON COUNTY. 

9201
05:04:09,697 --> 05:04:11,066
THERE WILL STILL BE SOME OF 

9202
05:04:11,066 --> 05:04:13,868
THESE GUSTS AND THIS LITTLE 

9203
05:04:13,868 --> 05:04:16,738
BAND SLIDING OUT THROUGH 

9204
05:04:16,738 --> 05:04:17,138
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 

9205
05:04:17,138 --> 05:04:18,640
INTO MADISON COUNTY, THOMAS AND 

9206
05:04:18,640 --> 05:04:19,007
BROOKS COUNTY. 

9207
05:04:19,007 --> 05:04:20,442
IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU MUCH, BUT 

9208
05:04:20,442 --> 05:04:21,743
THAT POTENTIAL IS STILL THERE 

9209
05:04:21,743 --> 05:04:24,045
FOR ONE OF THE SQUALLS TO SHOVE 

9210
05:04:24,045 --> 05:04:25,680
SOME OF THE STRONGER WINDS DOWN 

9211
05:04:25,680 --> 05:04:26,314
TOWARD THE SURFACE THAT COULD 

9212
05:04:26,314 --> 05:04:29,551
EXCEED  60 MILES AN HOUR. 

9213
05:04:29,551 --> 05:04:31,019
THEY WILL STILL BE LIKELY 

9214
05:04:31,019 --> 05:04:32,954
HIGHER THAN THAT AT TIMES 

9215
05:04:32,954 --> 05:04:34,089
ESPECIALLY FROM MILLER COUNTY, 

9216
05:04:34,089 --> 05:04:35,757
UP INTO EARLY AND BAKER 

9217
05:04:35,757 --> 05:04:37,492
COUNTIES WHERE WE STILL HAVE 

9218
05:04:37,492 --> 05:04:37,892
THAT POTENTIAL. 

9219
05:04:37,892 --> 05:04:39,294
THE DRY AIR IS WORKING ITS WAY 

9220
05:04:39,294 --> 05:04:40,195
IN FROM THE WEST. 

9221
05:04:40,195 --> 05:04:42,697
I'LL SHOW YOU A RADAR VIEW IN A 

9222
05:04:42,697 --> 05:04:43,098
MOMENT. 

9223
05:04:43,098 --> 05:04:45,467
GOT THE RADAR IMAGES BACK IN. 

9224
05:04:45,467 --> 05:04:46,868
BUT CLEARLY, YOU CAN SEE THAT 

9225
05:04:46,868 --> 05:04:49,637
IT'S JUST A HUGE CHUNK OF 

9226
05:04:49,637 --> 05:04:50,604
TROPICAL MOISTURE. 

9227
05:04:50,604 --> 05:04:51,639
BUT WATCH THE FUTURECAST. 

9228
05:04:51,639 --> 05:04:54,843
BECAUSE, DOWN HERE IS 

9229
05:04:54,843 --> 05:04:55,176
TALLAHASSEE. 

9230
05:04:55,176 --> 05:04:55,610
UP HERE IS ALBANY. 

9231
05:04:55,610 --> 05:04:57,679
AND WATCH THE TIME WE GET TO 

9232
05:04:57,679 --> 05:04:59,080
JUST AFTER 11:00 TONIGHT, THE 

9233
05:04:59,080 --> 05:05:01,082
CENTER SHOULD BE EXITING THE 

9234
05:05:01,082 --> 05:05:02,083
NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA 

9235
05:05:02,083 --> 05:05:03,184
TAKING ALMOST ALL THE RAINFALL 

9236
05:05:03,184 --> 05:05:03,450
WITH IT. 

9237
05:05:03,450 --> 05:05:05,487
IT WILL STILL BE RAINING AT 

9238
05:05:05,487 --> 05:05:07,288
TIMES ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTH 

9239
05:05:07,288 --> 05:05:09,324
GEORGIA. 

9240
05:05:09,324 --> 05:05:10,091
NORTH OF 84. 

9241
05:05:10,091 --> 05:05:14,095
DOWN SOUTH OF THE STATE LINE 

9242
05:05:14,095 --> 05:05:15,897
THERE WILL BE SCATTERED 

9243
05:05:15,897 --> 05:05:16,330
LEFTOVER SHOWERS. 

9244
05:05:16,330 --> 05:05:18,099
CHECKING OUT THE FORECAST WIND 

9245
05:05:18,099 --> 05:05:18,599
SPEEDS, WE'RE NOT DONE. 

9246
05:05:18,599 --> 05:05:20,101
THOUGH SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE 

9247
05:05:20,101 --> 05:05:21,102
NOTHING MORE THAN A LIGHT 

9248
05:05:21,102 --> 05:05:23,738
BREEZE, WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT 

9249
05:05:23,738 --> 05:05:24,105
THE FUTURECAST. 

9250
05:05:24,105 --> 05:05:25,407
WINDS SHOWING 40 TO 50 MILES AN 

9251
05:05:25,407 --> 05:05:26,875
HOUR ESPECIALLY IN THE GUSTS. 

9252
05:05:26,875 --> 05:05:28,676
MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED THAT WAY. 

9253
05:05:28,676 --> 05:05:29,944
BUT CERTAINLY NEAR THAT CENTER. 

9254
05:05:29,944 --> 05:05:33,080
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WINDS OF 40 

9255
05:05:33,080 --> 05:05:33,415
TO 50. 

9256
05:05:33,415 --> 05:05:34,716
SOMETIMES 70 OR 75 MILES AN 

9257
05:05:34,716 --> 05:05:34,916
HOUR. 

9258
05:05:34,916 --> 05:05:36,017
ESPECIALLY WITHIN A FEW MILES 

9259
05:05:36,017 --> 05:05:38,319
OF THAT CENTER AS IT MOVES OFF 

9260
05:05:38,319 --> 05:05:39,387
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST. 

9261
05:05:39,387 --> 05:05:39,887
THEN, THE WIND CHANGES 

9262
05:05:39,887 --> 05:05:40,187
DIRECTION. 

9263
05:05:40,187 --> 05:05:42,390
THE CENTER IS OUT OF THE 

9264
05:05:42,390 --> 05:05:43,091
PICTURE OVERNIGHT. 

9265
05:05:43,091 --> 05:05:45,994
WE GET BACK TO A WEST WIND. 

9266
05:05:45,994 --> 05:05:46,428
BETTER CONDITIONS. 

9267
05:05:46,428 --> 05:05:47,295
THE SURGE, I THINK WE'RE DONE 

9268
05:05:47,295 --> 05:05:50,031
WITH THE WORST OF THIS NOW. 

9269
05:05:50,031 --> 05:05:51,800
WE CAN START TO HOPEFULLY SEE 

9270
05:05:51,800 --> 05:05:52,567
THE WATERS RECEDE. 

9271
05:05:52,567 --> 05:05:57,939
BUT, THE WIND IS STILL COMING 

9272
05:05:57,939 --> 05:05:58,973
IN ALONG FROM THE COAST. 

9273
05:05:58,973 --> 05:06:01,176
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO RECEDE 

9274
05:06:01,176 --> 05:06:01,443
QUICKLY. 

9275
05:06:01,443 --> 05:06:02,643
THE TIDE IS GOING OUT, SO 

9276
05:06:02,643 --> 05:06:04,079
THAT'S ENCOURAGING BUT THE 

9277
05:06:04,079 --> 05:06:05,880
STORM SURGE WARNING CONTINUES 

9278
05:06:05,880 --> 05:06:11,319
IN EFFECT FOR TAYLOR, 

9279
05:06:11,319 --> 05:06:11,920
JEFFERSON, AND FRANKLIN 

9280
05:06:11,920 --> 05:06:12,187
COUNTIES. 

9281
05:06:12,187 --> 05:06:16,591
THREE HOURS AGO WE HEARD 

9282
05:06:16,591 --> 05:06:16,858
REPORTS. 

9283
05:06:16,858 --> 05:06:18,125
VERY LIKELY THIS FORECAST OF 

9284
05:06:18,125 --> 05:06:23,798
EIGHT TO 12 FEET POSSIBLY IN A  

9285
05:06:23,798 --> 05:06:26,101
FEW SPOTS ESPECIALLY UP TOWARD 

9286
05:06:26,101 --> 05:06:26,701
SAINT MARK. 

9287
05:06:26,701 --> 05:06:28,002
HOPEFULLY EVERYONE MADE IT 

9288
05:06:28,002 --> 05:06:28,335
THROUGH OKAY. 

9289
05:06:28,335 --> 05:06:29,938
ONCE WE GET OFFICIAL WORD, 

9290
05:06:29,938 --> 05:06:30,805
WE'LL PASS IT ALONG. 

9291
05:06:30,805 --> 05:06:32,006
LET'S GET TO THE RADAR. 

9292
05:06:32,006 --> 05:06:33,174
WE HAVE THE RADAR BACK IN 

9293
05:06:33,174 --> 05:06:34,175
BUSINESS. 

9294
05:06:34,175 --> 05:06:36,044
YOU CAN SEE THE CENTER NOW, A 

9295
05:06:36,044 --> 05:06:38,313
LOT OF THINGS WE CAN LOOK AT 

9296
05:06:38,313 --> 05:06:38,513
HERE. 

9297
05:06:38,513 --> 05:06:40,114
FIRST THING YOU MAY NOTICE IS 

9298
05:06:40,114 --> 05:06:47,889
HOW THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING 

9299
05:06:47,889 --> 05:06:48,723
SOUTH OF I-10. 

9300
05:06:48,723 --> 05:06:49,224
ROUGHLY. 

9301
05:06:49,224 --> 05:06:49,791
STILL SOME STORMINESS. 

9302
05:06:49,791 --> 05:06:50,792
DOWN TO LIBERTY COUNTY. 

9303
05:06:50,792 --> 05:06:52,093
THE CORE OF THE STRONGEST 

9304
05:06:52,093 --> 05:06:53,161
WINDS, THAT'S MAINLY TO THE 

9305
05:06:53,161 --> 05:06:58,099
NORTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER. 

9306
05:06:58,099 --> 05:07:02,203
STILL MOVING THROUGH MITCHELL 

9307
05:07:02,203 --> 05:07:02,437
COUNTY. 

9308
05:07:02,437 --> 05:07:07,842
BAKER COUNTY. 

9309
05:07:07,842 --> 05:07:10,544
MOVING THROUGH MILLER COUNTY. 

9310
05:07:10,544 --> 05:07:13,415
SOME BANDS, WE HAVE NOT SEEN 

9311
05:07:13,415 --> 05:07:14,215
THE ROTATING THUNDERSTORMS THAT 

9312
05:07:14,215 --> 05:07:15,617
ARE USUALLY FREQUENT WITH SOME 

9313
05:07:15,617 --> 05:07:17,819
OF THESE STORMSAS THEY COME IN 

9314
05:07:17,819 --> 05:07:19,721
FROM WATER TOWARD LAND. 

9315
05:07:19,721 --> 05:07:22,190
BUT, THERE ARE STILL SOME 

9316
05:07:22,190 --> 05:07:23,357
SQUALLS OUT THERE. 

9317
05:07:23,357 --> 05:07:24,526
AGAIN, SOME OF THESE RIGHT 

9318
05:07:24,526 --> 05:07:25,927
ALONG THE LEON COUNTY LINE. 

9319
05:07:25,927 --> 05:07:28,830
A FEW MORE AS YOU HEAD FURTHER 

9320
05:07:28,830 --> 05:07:29,664
EAST OUT INTO MADISON COUNTY. 

9321
05:07:29,664 --> 05:07:32,834
THOSE CONTINUING ON UP THROUGH 

9322
05:07:32,834 --> 05:07:33,868
BROOKS COUNTY AND COOKE COUNTY. 

9323
05:07:33,868 --> 05:07:35,003
NOT SEVERE, NOT GETTING ANY 

9324
05:07:35,003 --> 05:07:37,071
SIGNS OF ROTATION, BUT IT CAN 

9325
05:07:37,071 --> 05:07:38,773
PUSH THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE 

9326
05:07:38,773 --> 05:07:40,241
WINDS IN EXCESS OF 40 MILES AN 

9327
05:07:40,241 --> 05:07:41,309
HOUR DOWN TOWARD THE COAST. 

9328
05:07:41,309 --> 05:07:42,610
AND THESE BANDS THAT ARE STILL 

9329
05:07:42,610 --> 05:07:44,211
VERY INTENSE FROM THE EASTERN 

9330
05:07:44,211 --> 05:07:50,051
PARTS OF MILLER COUNTY AND INTO 

9331
05:07:50,051 --> 05:07:57,125
EARLY COUNTY, BAKER COUNTY, 

9332
05:07:57,125 --> 05:07:57,926
MITCHELL COUNTY. 

9333
05:07:57,926 --> 05:07:59,327
GETTING CLOSER TO DOUGHERTY 

9334
05:07:59,327 --> 05:07:59,560
COUNTY. 

9335
05:07:59,560 --> 05:08:01,029
MOVING FASTER THAN THAT NOW BUT 

9336
05:08:01,029 --> 05:08:02,831
I EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE 

9337
05:08:02,831 --> 05:08:04,132
OFF IN THAT DIRECTION. 

9338
05:08:04,132 --> 05:08:08,136
JUST TO GIVE YOU PERSPECTIVE 

9339
05:08:08,136 --> 05:08:12,607
WHEN WE SAY STRONGEST WINDS, IT 

9340
05:08:12,607 --> 05:08:13,408
LINES UP PRETTY WELL. 

9341
05:08:13,408 --> 05:08:14,576
IT GOES OUT TO ROUGHLY THE 

9342
05:08:14,576 --> 05:08:16,711
MITCHELL COUNTY LINE TO THE 

9343
05:08:16,711 --> 05:08:17,311
EAST. 

9344
05:08:17,311 --> 05:08:18,846
AND TO THE NORTHERN PARTS OF 

9345
05:08:18,846 --> 05:08:21,649
THE NORTH EASTERN PARTS OF 

9346
05:08:21,649 --> 05:08:21,982
EARLY COUNTY. 

9347
05:08:21,982 --> 05:08:25,453
AND AGAIN, THE CENTER IS MOVING 

9348
05:08:25,453 --> 05:08:26,621
THIS WAY SO BAKER COUNTY STILL 

9349
05:08:26,621 --> 05:08:32,160
COULD HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGER 

9350
05:08:32,160 --> 05:08:32,827
WIND GUSTS. 

9351
05:08:32,827 --> 05:08:35,229
WE HAVE A TORNADO WATCH IN 

9352
05:08:35,229 --> 05:08:35,462
EFFECT. 

9353
05:08:35,462 --> 05:08:36,531
THE HURRICANE WARNINGS WILL BE 

9354
05:08:36,531 --> 05:08:38,766
DISCONTINUED AS THE WINDS GET 

9355
05:08:38,766 --> 05:08:41,502
LIGHTER. 

9356
05:08:41,502 --> 05:08:44,305
THE EXTREME WIND WARNING NEAR 

9357
05:08:44,305 --> 05:08:45,206
THE EYE WALL. 

9358
05:08:45,206 --> 05:08:46,307
THOUGH IT HASN'T OFFICIALLY 

9359
05:08:46,307 --> 05:08:47,408
BEEN EXTENDED UP INTO BAKER 

9360
05:08:47,408 --> 05:08:49,043
COUNTY, YOU MAY NOT GET THE 

9361
05:08:49,043 --> 05:08:51,145
WARNING BUT YOU'LL GET THE 

9362
05:08:51,145 --> 05:08:51,846
POSSIBILITY FOR DAMAGING WIND 

9363
05:08:51,846 --> 05:08:52,347
GUSTS. 

9364
05:08:52,347 --> 05:08:53,948
AND THERE'S STILL THE THREAT 

9365
05:08:53,948 --> 05:08:56,851
FOR A FEW TORNADOES AND FOR 

9366
05:08:56,851 --> 05:08:58,218
SOME VERY HEAVY RAINFALL. 

9367
05:08:58,218 --> 05:08:58,786
ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST 

9368
05:08:58,786 --> 05:08:59,053
GEORGIA. 

9369
05:08:59,053 --> 05:08:59,854
CERTAINLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE 

9370
05:08:59,854 --> 05:09:01,388
ANY LONGER FOR NEW RAINFALL 

9371
05:09:01,388 --> 05:09:05,259
BEING A MAJOR PROBLEM ACROSS 

9372
05:09:05,259 --> 05:09:06,127
THE BIG BEND. 

9373
05:09:06,127 --> 05:09:07,428
ROUGHLY FROM WEST OF U.S. 19. 

9374
05:09:07,428 --> 05:09:08,763
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT 

9375
05:09:08,763 --> 05:09:10,264
THE MOST LIKELY AREAS, SEEING A 

9376
05:09:10,264 --> 05:09:11,432
FEW MORE INCHES OF RAINFALL. 

9377
05:09:11,432 --> 05:09:19,173
WE COULD START TO DROP THESE 

9378
05:09:19,173 --> 05:09:20,708
NUMBERS NOW. 

9379
05:09:20,708 --> 05:09:22,210
PROBABLY CUT THESE IN HALF. 

9380
05:09:22,210 --> 05:09:23,111
REDUCE THE COASTAL WIND 

9381
05:09:23,111 --> 05:09:25,346
ESTIMATES FROM 20 TO 40 MILES 

9382
05:09:25,346 --> 05:09:25,847
AN HOUR. 

9383
05:09:25,847 --> 05:09:26,748
WHILE THE WINDS, STILL THE 

9384
05:09:26,748 --> 05:09:27,915
POTENTIAL IS THERE NEAR THE 

9385
05:09:27,915 --> 05:09:30,151
CENTER OF SEEING 75 MILES AN 

9386
05:09:30,151 --> 05:09:31,052
HOUR GUSTS. 

9387
05:09:31,052 --> 05:09:32,053
OVERALL, WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE 

9388
05:09:32,053 --> 05:09:33,655
WEAKENING BUT EVERYTHING ELSE 

9389
05:09:33,655 --> 05:09:36,791
IS STILL IN PLAY. 

9390
05:09:36,791 --> 05:09:39,360
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR RESIDENTS 

9391
05:09:39,360 --> 05:09:40,461
WATCHING US IN SOUTHWEST 

9392
05:09:40,461 --> 05:09:40,728
GEORGIA. 

9393
05:09:40,728 --> 05:09:47,936
THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE A 

9394
05:09:47,936 --> 05:09:50,638
STRAIGHT GUST OR TWO TOPPING 50 

9395
05:09:50,638 --> 05:09:53,141
OR 60 MILES AN HOUR. 

9396
05:09:53,141 --> 05:09:54,342
YOU NEED TO LET THE FIRST 

9397
05:09:54,342 --> 05:09:55,443
RESPONDER CREWS GET OUT THERE 

9398
05:09:55,443 --> 05:09:56,744
AND STAY OUT OF THEIR WAY AN 

9399
05:09:56,744 --> 05:09:59,614
THINGS WILL GET A LOT QUICKER. 

9400
05:09:59,614 --> 05:10:00,014
THAT'S IT AGAIN. 

9401
05:10:00,014 --> 05:10:07,021
WE WILL TOSS IT BACK TO YOU. 

9402
05:10:07,021 --> 05:10:08,756
>> MIKE, THANK YOU. 

9403
05:10:08,756 --> 05:10:09,757
AND, GOVERNOR SCOTT WAS GIVING 

9404
05:10:09,757 --> 05:10:11,960
A BRIEFING A FEW MINUTES AGO. 

9405
05:10:11,960 --> 05:10:16,364
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE DON'T HAVE 

9406
05:10:16,364 --> 05:10:18,066
ANY CONFIRMED REPORTS OF 

9407
05:10:18,066 --> 05:10:18,966
FATALITIES NOW FROM THIS STORM. 

9408
05:10:18,966 --> 05:10:22,169
HE HAD BEEN GOING AROUND THE 

9409
05:10:22,169 --> 05:10:26,174
STATE AHEAD OF THIS STORM, GET 

9410
05:10:26,174 --> 05:10:27,775
OUT OF HARM'S WAY. 

9411
05:10:27,775 --> 05:10:28,042
EVACUATE. 

9412
05:10:28,042 --> 05:10:29,143
FOLLOW THE ORDERS. 

9413
05:10:29,143 --> 05:10:29,676
WE CAN'T REPLACE A LIFE. 

9414
05:10:29,676 --> 05:10:31,079
BUT WE CAN PREPLACE THE 

9415
05:10:31,079 --> 05:10:31,346
PROPERTY. 

9416
05:10:31,346 --> 05:10:32,380
THAT HAS BEEN HIS MESSAGE 

9417
05:10:32,380 --> 05:10:33,481
THROUGHOUT THIS. 

9418
05:10:33,481 --> 05:10:34,982
AND THAT WOULD BE SOME 

9419
05:10:34,982 --> 05:10:35,984
FANTASTIC NEWS IF THAT 

9420
05:10:35,984 --> 05:10:39,987
CONTINUES TO HOLD TRUE. 

9421
05:10:39,987 --> 05:10:40,588
>> IF THAT HOLDS. 

9422
05:10:40,588 --> 05:10:41,089
THAT'S RIGHT. 

9423
05:10:41,089 --> 05:10:43,123
>> SO FAR, NO CONFIRMED REPORTS 

9424
05:10:43,123 --> 05:10:46,194
OF FATALITIES IN FLORIDA FROM 

9425
05:10:46,194 --> 05:10:46,694
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

9426
05:10:46,694 --> 05:10:48,096
>>> OUR CREWS ARE BEGINNING TO 

9427
05:10:48,096 --> 05:10:52,400
MOVE NOW. 

9428
05:10:52,400 --> 05:10:53,601
IT'S SAFER TO MOVE ABOUT. 

9429
05:10:53,601 --> 05:10:54,902
WE HOPE TO SHARE MORE VIDEOS AS 

9430
05:10:54,902 --> 05:10:57,572
THEY ARE ABOUT TO GET OUT AND 

9431
05:10:57,572 --> 05:10:58,372
ACTUALLY SEE FOR THEMSELVES. 

9432
05:10:58,372 --> 05:11:00,041
ALSO, WE WANT TO THANK ONE OF 

9433
05:11:00,041 --> 05:11:02,744
OUR VIEWERS WHO SENT THIS VIDEO 

9434
05:11:02,744 --> 05:11:02,977
OF US. 

9435
05:11:02,977 --> 05:11:07,882
YOU CAN SEE THIS TREE WOBBLING 

9436
05:11:07,882 --> 05:11:08,716
BEFORE IT FALLS. 

9437
05:11:08,716 --> 05:11:10,585
ONE OF THOUSANDS OF TREES IN 

9438
05:11:10,585 --> 05:11:10,918
TALLAHASSEE. 

9439
05:11:10,918 --> 05:11:12,787
>> THIS IS THE VIDEO WE'RE JUST 

9440
05:11:12,787 --> 05:11:16,390
GETTING A LOT OF THESE PICTURES 

9441
05:11:16,390 --> 05:11:18,793
AND IMAGES IN FROM ALL OVER THE 

9442
05:11:18,793 --> 05:11:23,765
REGION, ESPECIALLY IN 

9443
05:11:23,765 --> 05:11:24,098
TALLAHASSEE. 

9444
05:11:24,098 --> 05:11:25,299
AND THERE IT GOES. 

9445
05:11:25,299 --> 05:11:25,499
LOOK. 

9446
05:11:25,499 --> 05:11:25,866
THERE IT GOES. 

9447
05:11:25,866 --> 05:11:27,602
>> YOU CAN'T HEAR IT BUT I'M 

9448
05:11:27,602 --> 05:11:29,003
SURE THAT WAS QUITE A THUD. 

9449
05:11:29,003 --> 05:11:30,271
>> IT KIND OF FELL IN SLOW 

9450
05:11:30,271 --> 05:11:31,072
MOTION. 

9451
05:11:31,072 --> 05:11:33,274
>> WE HAVE SEEN SOME REMARKABLE 

9452
05:11:33,274 --> 05:11:33,541
PICTURES. 

9453
05:11:33,541 --> 05:11:35,376
ONE GENTLEMAN SENDING US A 

9454
05:11:35,376 --> 05:11:36,978
PHOTO OF A HUGE PINE OR OAK. 

9455
05:11:36,978 --> 05:11:42,116
BUT IT SPLIT AND FELL RIGHT IN 

9456
05:11:42,116 --> 05:11:44,018
FRONT OF HIS HOME. 

9457
05:11:44,018 --> 05:11:45,319
THANKFULLY FALLING IN THE 

9458
05:11:45,319 --> 05:11:45,820
OPPOSITE DIRECTION. 

9459
05:11:45,820 --> 05:11:46,821
>> THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER 

9460
05:11:46,821 --> 05:11:50,992
ONE WHERE IT CAME UP BY THE 

9461
05:11:50,992 --> 05:11:52,493
ROOTS AND FELL OVER. 

9462
05:11:52,493 --> 05:11:57,598
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS, IT'S 

9463
05:11:57,598 --> 05:11:58,900
JUST CUT THROUGH THE WOOD. 

9464
05:11:58,900 --> 05:12:01,402
>> ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN 

9465
05:12:01,402 --> 05:12:03,137
PANAMA CITY SENT OUT A PHOTO 

9466
05:12:03,137 --> 05:12:04,405
AND YOU COULD SEE THE TREES 

9467
05:12:04,405 --> 05:12:09,710
SHEARED AT THE SAME LEVEL BY 

9468
05:12:09,710 --> 05:12:10,278
THE WIND. 

9469
05:12:10,278 --> 05:12:17,418
>> THIS REMINDS ME OF TORNADO 

9470
05:12:17,418 --> 05:12:17,651
DAMAGE. 

9471
05:12:17,651 --> 05:12:18,619
WHERE IT'S JUST MOWING THINGS 

9472
05:12:18,619 --> 05:12:21,222
DOWN AND THE TREES ARE LOPPED 

9473
05:12:21,222 --> 05:12:21,422
OFF. 

9474
05:12:21,422 --> 05:12:22,190
IT'S JUST REALLY DEVASTATING 

9475
05:12:22,190 --> 05:12:26,027
WHEN THAT SORT OF WIND DAMAGE 

9476
05:12:26,027 --> 05:12:26,294
HAPPENS. 

9477
05:12:26,294 --> 05:12:28,229
>>> AND WE WERE EXPECTING 

9478
05:12:28,229 --> 05:12:29,831
TREMENDOUS STORM SURGE ALONG 

9479
05:12:29,831 --> 05:12:30,198
THE COASTLINE. 

9480
05:12:30,198 --> 05:12:33,467
THIS IS VIDEO FROM I BELIEVE 

9481
05:12:33,467 --> 05:12:35,770
THIS IS FROM PORT SAINT JOE. 

9482
05:12:35,770 --> 05:12:40,575
YOU CAN SEE THE WATER FLOWING 

9483
05:12:40,575 --> 05:12:41,109
IN THE STREET. 

9484
05:12:41,109 --> 05:12:43,377
AND YOU CAN SEE THE WIND. 

9485
05:12:43,377 --> 05:12:47,048
MOVING THROUGH THE STREET OF 

9486
05:12:47,048 --> 05:12:47,782
PORT SAINT JOE. 

9487
05:12:47,782 --> 05:12:49,717
INCREDIBLE STORM SURGE YOU'RE 

9488
05:12:49,717 --> 05:12:50,050
SEEING HERE. 

9489
05:12:50,050 --> 05:12:51,352
I THINK MIKE MENTIONED JUST A 

9490
05:12:51,352 --> 05:12:53,588
MOMENT AGO, THE TIDE IS GOING 

9491
05:12:53,588 --> 05:12:53,921
OUT. 

9492
05:12:53,921 --> 05:12:55,923
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE 

9493
05:12:55,923 --> 05:12:57,091
SOME RELIEF TO THIS FLOODING. 

9494
05:12:57,091 --> 05:12:59,026
THE INCREDIBLE WATER ON THE 

9495
05:12:59,026 --> 05:13:00,094
ROADS HERE. 

9496
05:13:00,094 --> 05:13:01,028
>> INSIDE THE BUSINESSES 

9497
05:13:01,028 --> 05:13:01,729
CLEARLY. 

9498
05:13:01,729 --> 05:13:03,030
>> AND INSIDE HOMES AND 

9499
05:13:03,030 --> 05:13:03,330
BUSINESSES. 

9500
05:13:03,330 --> 05:13:08,436
WE SAW ALSO THIS KIND OF 

9501
05:13:08,436 --> 05:13:09,871
RUSHING WATER IN DOWNTOWN 

9502
05:13:09,871 --> 05:13:10,204
APALACHICOLA. 

9503
05:13:10,204 --> 05:13:12,006
WE ARE ANXIOUS TO GET THERE AND

9685
05:18:35,496 --> 05:18:36,096
LATER. 

9686
05:18:36,096 --> 05:18:37,531
REPORTING IN CAIRO, EMMA 

9687
05:18:37,531 --> 05:18:38,198
WHEELER, WCTV, EYEWITNESS NEWS. 

9688
05:18:38,198 --> 05:18:41,568
>> YOU CAN TELL WHAT THE 

9689
05:18:41,568 --> 05:18:42,069
CONDITIONS ARE THERE. 

9690
05:18:42,069 --> 05:18:45,072
>> EMMA'S HAIR TOLD THE STORY. 

9691
05:18:45,072 --> 05:18:45,372
>> IT DOES. 

9692
05:18:45,372 --> 05:18:45,873
IT DOES. 

9693
05:18:45,873 --> 05:18:47,675
>> SWIRLING AROUND. 

9694
05:18:47,675 --> 05:18:50,578
>> AND THINGS LOOK A LITTLE 

9695
05:18:50,578 --> 05:18:51,211
CALMER WITH ALICIA. 

9696
05:18:51,211 --> 05:18:52,813
YOU CAN SEE THE STORM IN SOUTH 

9697
05:18:52,813 --> 05:18:54,781
GEORGIA, THEY ARE GETTING A LOT 

9698
05:18:54,781 --> 05:18:55,648
OF WIND AND RAIN. 

9699
05:18:55,648 --> 05:18:59,420
>> AND A LOT OF POWER OUTAGES. 

9700
05:18:59,420 --> 05:19:01,222
WE WANT TO SHARE PICTURES OF 

9701
05:19:01,222 --> 05:19:04,525
THE DAMAGE COMING IN FROM YOU 

9702
05:19:04,525 --> 05:19:05,258
THE VIEWERS. 

9703
05:19:05,258 --> 05:19:06,794
YOU SEE THE TREE CLEAR ACROSS 

9704
05:19:06,794 --> 05:19:07,194
THIS ROAD. 

9705
05:19:07,194 --> 05:19:09,330
AND A LOT OF TREE AND LEAF 

9706
05:19:09,330 --> 05:19:11,031
DEBRIS WITH IT AND THE FIRE 

9707
05:19:11,031 --> 05:19:11,665
DEPARTMENT THERE HELPING WITH 

9708
05:19:11,665 --> 05:19:12,733
THE CLEANUP OR AT LEAST MOVING 

9709
05:19:12,733 --> 05:19:18,072
THAT TREE OFF THE ROAD SO THE 

9710
05:19:18,072 --> 05:19:19,306
ROAD CAN BE PASSABLE AGAIN. 

9711
05:19:19,306 --> 05:19:22,142
THIS IS THE THING YOU WILL SEE 

9712
05:19:22,142 --> 05:19:23,010
WIDESPREAD ACROSS NOT ONLY 

9713
05:19:23,010 --> 05:19:25,012
TALLAHASSEE BUT THE BIG BEND 

9714
05:19:25,012 --> 05:19:26,647
AND MUCH OF NORTH FLORIDA AND 

9715
05:19:26,647 --> 05:19:27,314
SOUTH GEORGIA. 

9716
05:19:27,314 --> 05:19:30,150
>> THIS IS THE CHALLENGE MOVING 

9717
05:19:30,150 --> 05:19:30,417
FORWARD. 

9718
05:19:30,417 --> 05:19:32,119
YOU CAN SEE OFFICERS DOING WHAT 

9719
05:19:32,119 --> 05:19:34,188
THEY CAN TO CLEAR DEBRIS OUT OF 

9720
05:19:34,188 --> 05:19:34,587
THE ROADWAYS. 

9721
05:19:34,587 --> 05:19:36,123
THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING EFFORT 

9722
05:19:36,123 --> 05:19:41,529
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TO 

9723
05:19:41,529 --> 05:19:44,832
TRY TO CLEAR THE TREES AND 

9724
05:19:44,832 --> 05:19:45,099
ROADWAYS. 

9725
05:19:45,099 --> 05:19:46,800
AGAIN, A REMINDER THAT IF YOU 

9726
05:19:46,800 --> 05:19:49,470
CAN, PLEASE STAY ARE YOU ARE 

9727
05:19:49,470 --> 05:19:49,670
NOW. 

9728
05:19:49,670 --> 05:19:50,104
DON'T VENTURE OUT. 

9729
05:19:50,104 --> 05:19:52,806
A LOT OF THE ROADWAYS ARE 

9730
05:19:52,806 --> 05:19:53,207
CLOSED. 

9731
05:19:53,207 --> 05:19:54,541
IT COULD LEAD TO LENGTHY 

9732
05:19:54,541 --> 05:19:56,210
DETOURS AND IT COULD BE 

9733
05:19:56,210 --> 05:19:58,245
DANGEROUS IN TERMS OF WIRES 

9734
05:19:58,245 --> 05:19:58,445
DOWN. 

9735
05:19:58,445 --> 05:19:58,913
LIMBS DOWN. 

9736
05:19:58,913 --> 05:20:02,182
AS THEY SAID, SOMETIMES, THE 

9737
05:20:02,182 --> 05:20:04,418
TREES WILL TOPPLE LATER. 

9738
05:20:04,418 --> 05:20:04,685
YOU KNOW. 

9739
05:20:04,685 --> 05:20:05,519
THE GROUND IS SATURATED AND 

9740
05:20:05,519 --> 05:20:06,553
SOMETIMES THEY'LL FALL AFTER 

9741
05:20:06,553 --> 05:20:07,554
THE STORM HAS PASSED. 

9742
05:20:07,554 --> 05:20:08,822
>> YOU SEE THAT IN THESE CASES 

9743
05:20:08,822 --> 05:20:17,932
WHERE A DAY OR TWO OR A WEEK 

9744
05:20:17,932 --> 05:20:19,633
LATER THE TREES HAVE BEEN 

9745
05:20:19,633 --> 05:20:19,899
WEAKENED. 

9746
05:20:19,899 --> 05:20:23,170
THEN THE TREE GOES OVER AS 

9747
05:20:23,170 --> 05:20:23,370
WELL. 

9748
05:20:23,370 --> 05:20:27,474
SO IT'S LIKE A LINGERING 

9749
05:20:27,474 --> 05:20:27,708
IMPACT. 

9750
05:20:27,708 --> 05:20:30,077
>> AND MARIEL MENTIONED 160,000 

9751
05:20:30,077 --> 05:20:31,545
PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT POWER RIGHT 

9752
05:20:31,545 --> 05:20:31,745
NOW. 

9753
05:20:31,745 --> 05:20:36,016
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO THE 

9754
05:20:36,016 --> 05:20:37,851
NEXT FEW DAYS TO RESTORE THAT. 

9755
05:20:37,851 --> 05:20:39,320
THERE ARE CREWS FROM ALL OVER 

9756
05:20:39,320 --> 05:20:41,455
THE REGION HERE TO HELP WITH 

9757
05:20:41,455 --> 05:20:41,655
THAT. 

9758
05:20:41,655 --> 05:20:44,858
THEY ARE STAGED HERE AND ABLE 

9759
05:20:44,858 --> 05:20:50,064
TO GO OUT AND START RESTORING 

9760
05:20:50,064 --> 05:20:50,297
POWER. 

9761
05:20:50,297 --> 05:20:50,830
THAT IS A PROCESS. 

9762
05:20:50,830 --> 05:20:54,735
EVERYONE HOPES WE CAN BE 

9763
05:20:54,735 --> 05:20:55,536
PATIENT THROUGH THAT. 

9764
05:20:55,536 --> 05:20:57,504
>>> LET'S TAKE A LIVE LOOK AT 

9765
05:20:57,504 --> 05:20:57,904
PANAMA CITY NOW. 

9766
05:20:57,904 --> 05:20:59,907
THIS IS RIGHT NEAR WHERE THE 

9767
05:20:59,907 --> 05:21:00,908
STORM WENT THROUGH. 

9768
05:21:00,908 --> 05:21:03,010
THIS LOOKS LIKE A DRIVING SHOT 

9769
05:21:03,010 --> 05:21:04,777
ALONG THE WATER. 

9770
05:21:04,777 --> 05:21:06,680
THIS IS COMING TO US LIVE FROM 

9771
05:21:06,680 --> 05:21:11,652
ONE OF OUR AFFILIATES OVER 

9772
05:21:11,652 --> 05:21:12,019
THERE. 

9773
05:21:12,019 --> 05:21:14,387
YOU SEE THE DOWNED POWER LINES. 

9774
05:21:14,387 --> 05:21:19,059
>> HUGE DEBRIS THERE ON THE 

9775
05:21:19,059 --> 05:21:19,326
ROADWAYS. 

9776
05:21:19,326 --> 05:21:21,962
THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS 

9777
05:21:21,962 --> 05:21:28,268
TIME THE BE ON THE ROAD. 

9778
05:21:28,268 --> 05:21:31,138
SOME OF THEM SEEM THE BE LOPPED 

9779
05:21:31,138 --> 05:21:32,039
OFF HALFWAY UP. 

9780
05:21:32,039 --> 05:21:37,578
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE IN THE PANAMA 

9781
05:21:37,578 --> 05:21:38,211
CITY BEACH AREA. 

9782
05:21:38,211 --> 05:21:40,147
>> UNBELIEVABLE IMAGES. 

9783
05:21:40,147 --> 05:21:43,951
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHAT THE 

9784
05:21:43,951 --> 05:21:45,853
TREES LOOKED LIKE BEFORE. 

9785
05:21:45,853 --> 05:21:51,959
BUT I GUESS THEY HAD FULL 

9786
05:21:51,959 --> 05:21:54,127
CANOPIES AND LEAVES. 

9787
05:21:54,127 --> 05:21:57,264
>> YOU CAN SEE WHERE THEY ARE 

9788
05:21:57,264 --> 05:21:58,065
SNAPPED IN HALF. 

9789
05:21:58,065 --> 05:21:59,699
THAT'S THE POWER OF THE WINDS. 

9790
05:21:59,699 --> 05:22:01,201
WHEN THIS STORM CAME ASHORE 

9791
05:22:01,201 --> 05:22:03,637
JUST EAST OF PANAMA CITY TODAY, 

9792
05:22:03,637 --> 05:22:09,343
IT CAME ASHORE AS A CAT 4. 

9793
05:22:09,343 --> 05:22:10,411
UNPRECEDENTED IN THIS AREA. 

9794
05:22:10,411 --> 05:22:11,678
>> THERE'S A POWER LINE LEANING 

9795
05:22:11,678 --> 05:22:12,079
OVER THERE. 

9796
05:22:12,079 --> 05:22:16,583
>> I'M NOT SURE WHO IS DRIVING  

9797
05:22:16,583 --> 05:22:17,450
THIS CAR, BUT BE CAREFUL. 

9798
05:22:17,450 --> 05:22:19,086
>> LOOK AT THE OTHER TRAFFIC ON 

9799
05:22:19,086 --> 05:22:19,686
THE ROAD. 

9800
05:22:19,686 --> 05:22:20,888
PEOPLE ARE GETTING OUT TRYING 

9801
05:22:20,888 --> 05:22:24,691
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON I 

9802
05:22:24,691 --> 05:22:24,924
GUESS. 

9803
05:22:24,924 --> 05:22:25,625
>> THESE IMAGES HONESTLY REMIND 

9804
05:22:25,625 --> 05:22:28,262
ME OF GOING TO SEE THE DAMAGE 

9805
05:22:28,262 --> 05:22:29,296
AFTER HURRICANE IVAN. 

9806
05:22:29,296 --> 05:22:29,629
VERY SIMILAR. 

9807
05:22:29,629 --> 05:22:32,566
A LOT OF THE TREES JUST 

9808
05:22:32,566 --> 05:22:33,867
COMPLETELY BLOWN TO THE SIDE. 

9809
05:22:33,867 --> 05:22:35,402
AND MANY OF THEM SNAPPED IN 

9810
05:22:35,402 --> 05:22:35,602
HALF. 

9811
05:22:35,602 --> 05:22:37,738
>> THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN I 

9812
05:22:37,738 --> 05:22:41,241
WAS THERE, THE AFTERMATH OF 

9813
05:22:41,241 --> 05:22:41,641
KATRINA HONESTLY. 

9814
05:22:41,641 --> 05:22:44,578
WHAT SOME OF THE TREES LOOK 

9815
05:22:44,578 --> 05:22:45,279
LIKE AS WELL. 

9816
05:22:45,279 --> 05:22:47,081
AND, IT LOOKS LIKE A DEBRIS 

9817
05:22:47,081 --> 05:22:51,084
PILE THERE FROM WHAT WAS A SIGN 

9818
05:22:51,084 --> 05:22:51,785
THAT WAS KNOCKED DOWN. 

9819
05:22:51,785 --> 05:22:56,390
AND, LIKE I SAID, LOOKS LIKE A 

9820
05:22:56,390 --> 05:22:56,656
WAR ZONE. 

9821
05:22:56,656 --> 05:22:57,023
UNFORTUNATELY. 

9822
05:22:57,023 --> 05:22:57,791
>> AND MIKE MCCALL IS HERE, 

9823
05:22:57,791 --> 05:22:59,860
YOU'VE BEEN WITH US THROUGHOUT 

9824
05:22:59,860 --> 05:23:00,293
THIS ENTIRE STORM. 

9825
05:23:00,293 --> 05:23:01,795
YOU AND ALL OF THE 

9826
05:23:01,795 --> 05:23:02,796
METEOROLOGISTS AND THE WEATHER 

9827
05:23:02,796 --> 05:23:02,996
TEAM. 

9828
05:23:02,996 --> 05:23:04,198
SO THANKS FOR STICKING WITH US 

9829
05:23:04,198 --> 05:23:06,800
ALL NIGHT LONG TO MAKE SURE 

9830
05:23:06,800 --> 05:23:09,303
EVERYONE HAS THE BEST 

9831
05:23:09,303 --> 05:23:09,636
INFORMATION. 

9832
05:23:09,636 --> 05:23:10,237
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? 

9833
05:23:10,237 --> 05:23:10,971
THIS STORM IS NOT OVER. 

9834
05:23:10,971 --> 05:23:13,574
AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S 

9835
05:23:13,574 --> 05:23:13,774
NEXT. 

9836
05:23:13,774 --> 05:23:15,876
>> NO, IT'S NOT OVER. 

9837
05:23:15,876 --> 05:23:17,177
AND WHILE IT'S GETTING BETTER, 

9838
05:23:17,177 --> 05:23:18,311
IT'S ABSOLUTELY A MUCH WEAKER 

9839
05:23:18,311 --> 05:23:22,216
STORM NOW THAN IT WAS WHEN IT 

9840
05:23:22,216 --> 05:23:22,716
MADE LANDFALL. 

9841
05:23:22,716 --> 05:23:24,284
BUT, WE HAVE NOT SEEN, WE HAVE 

9842
05:23:24,284 --> 05:23:26,186
NOT HAD ANY OFFICIAL REPORTS IN 

9843
05:23:26,186 --> 05:23:28,789
OUR AREA OF SEEING THOSE WINDS 

9844
05:23:28,789 --> 05:23:32,292
UPWARDS OF 100 MILES AN HOUR. 

9845
05:23:32,292 --> 05:23:34,795
DID SEE A GUST IN MARIANA AT 

9846
05:23:34,795 --> 05:23:34,995
102. 

9847
05:23:34,995 --> 05:23:40,801
DOWN TOWARD THE COAST, WE HAD 

9848
05:23:40,801 --> 05:23:44,371
WINDS AT THE TINDEL AIR FORCE 

9849
05:23:44,371 --> 05:23:48,776
BASE GUSTING TO 149 BEFORE 

9850
05:23:48,776 --> 05:23:50,010
THEIR EQUIPMENT FAILED. 

9851
05:23:50,010 --> 05:23:50,511
CERTAINLY A HISTORY OF 

9852
05:23:50,511 --> 05:23:52,613
PRODUCING 100 PLUS MILES AN 

9853
05:23:52,613 --> 05:23:53,714
HOUR WINDS ACROSS THE EMERALD 

9854
05:23:53,714 --> 05:23:56,016
COAST AS IT MOVES OFF TOWARD 

9855
05:23:56,016 --> 05:23:56,383
THE NORTHEAST. 

9856
05:23:56,383 --> 05:23:58,318
AND EVEN UP INTO JACKSON 

9857
05:23:58,318 --> 05:23:58,719
COUNTY. 

9858
05:23:58,719 --> 05:24:00,020
NOW, WE'RE SEEING THE WHOLE 

9859
05:24:00,020 --> 05:24:02,089
SYSTEM START TO TAKE THE 

9860
05:24:02,089 --> 05:24:05,726
EFFECTS OF SOME DRIER AIR 

9861
05:24:05,726 --> 05:24:06,126
COMING IN. 

9862
05:24:06,126 --> 05:24:07,394
STRONGER WIND SHEAR COMING 

9863
05:24:07,394 --> 05:24:07,728
TOGETHER. 

9864
05:24:07,728 --> 05:24:09,429
BUT THE RADAR STILL CLEARLY 

9865
05:24:09,429 --> 05:24:10,230
SHOWING THE CENTER. 

9866
05:24:10,230 --> 05:24:15,068
IT DOESN'T LOOK NEARLY AS 

9867
05:24:15,068 --> 05:24:15,368
FORMIDABLE. 

9868
05:24:15,368 --> 05:24:16,970
DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU TOO 

9869
05:24:16,970 --> 05:24:17,170
MUCH. 

9870
05:24:17,170 --> 05:24:21,175
IF YOU'RE IN SOUTH GEORGIA OR 

9871
05:24:21,175 --> 05:24:23,377
NORTH OF 84, WEST OF 19, THAT'S 

9872
05:24:23,377 --> 05:24:25,111
PRETTY MUCH THE AREA THAT COULD 

9873
05:24:25,111 --> 05:24:27,414
STILL SEE THESE 50 TO 60 TO 70 

9874
05:24:27,414 --> 05:24:30,117
MILES AN HOUR GUSTS. 

9875
05:24:30,117 --> 05:24:31,218
ESPECIALLY NEAR THAT CENTER. 

9876
05:24:31,218 --> 05:24:33,120
EVEN BEYOND THAT, WHILE OVERALL 

9877
05:24:33,120 --> 05:24:33,921
CONDITIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY 

9878
05:24:33,921 --> 05:24:37,524
IMPROVING, YOU GET SOUTH OF 84, 

9879
05:24:37,524 --> 05:24:40,227
YOU GET DOWN INTO GADSTON, 

9880
05:24:40,227 --> 05:24:42,229
LEON, ON OVER TOWARD BROOKS, 

9881
05:24:42,229 --> 05:24:43,997
YEAH, CONDITIONS ARE IMPROVING. 

9882
05:24:43,997 --> 05:24:45,933
BUT, STILL, THESE LITTLE 

9883
05:24:45,933 --> 05:24:46,833
SQUALLS COULD STILL BRING DOWN 

9884
05:24:46,833 --> 05:24:49,736
SOME 50 OR 60 MILES AN HOUR 

9885
05:24:49,736 --> 05:24:49,970
GUSTS. 

9886
05:24:49,970 --> 05:24:50,270
QUICK ONES. 

9887
05:24:50,270 --> 05:24:51,672
BUT NONETHELESS, IT'S STILL A 

9888
05:24:51,672 --> 05:24:53,106
LITTLE TOO DANGEROUS TO VENTURE 

9889
05:24:53,106 --> 05:24:53,574
OUT. 

9890
05:24:53,574 --> 05:24:56,910
ABSOLUTELY THE WINDS ARE 

9891
05:24:56,910 --> 05:24:58,111
GETTING LIGHTER AND WILL 

9892
05:24:58,111 --> 05:24:58,712
CONTINUE TO DO THAT. 

9893
05:24:58,712 --> 05:25:01,515
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY 

9894
05:25:01,515 --> 05:25:01,948
UNNECESSARY RISKS. 

9895
05:25:01,948 --> 05:25:04,618
HERE AT THE CENTER, MILLER 

9896
05:25:04,618 --> 05:25:10,123
COUNTY MOVING INTO EARLY 

9897
05:25:10,123 --> 05:25:10,524
COUNTY. 

9898
05:25:10,524 --> 05:25:10,857
BAKER COUNTY. 

9899
05:25:10,857 --> 05:25:13,227
UP TOWARD MILLFORD, LIKELY 

9900
05:25:13,227 --> 05:25:14,728
DAMAGING WIND GUSTS WITH THAT. 

9901
05:25:14,728 --> 05:25:15,862
THESE OTHER LITTLE BANDS THAT 

9902
05:25:15,862 --> 05:25:21,835
EXTEND TO THE EAST OF CAMILLA 

9903
05:25:21,835 --> 05:25:24,071
AND SPENCE AND GRADY COUNTY. 

9904
05:25:24,071 --> 05:25:25,205
NOT FAR FROM THOMAS COUNTY. 

9905
05:25:25,205 --> 05:25:36,183
STILL COULD SEE NOW, IT MAY BE 

9906
05:25:36,183 --> 05:25:36,416
ALOFT. 

9907
05:25:36,416 --> 05:25:37,417
WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL PICTURES 

9908
05:25:37,417 --> 05:25:39,519
WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE THE TREE 

9909
05:25:39,519 --> 05:25:41,154
TOPS ARE BLOWING BUT THERE IS 

9910
05:25:41,154 --> 05:25:43,322
JUST A LITTLE BREEZE AT GROUND. 

9911
05:25:43,322 --> 05:25:45,058
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THIS TOO 

9912
05:25:45,058 --> 05:25:46,193
LIGHTLY JUST YET. 

9913
05:25:46,193 --> 05:25:48,528
ANY OF THESE LITTLE SQUALLS 

9914
05:25:48,528 --> 05:25:50,030
COULD PUSH SYSTEM OF THE 

9915
05:25:50,030 --> 05:25:53,599
STRONGER WINDS TO THE SURFACE. 

9916
05:25:53,599 --> 05:25:55,836
THIS IS OVER THE LAST HOUR. 

9917
05:25:55,836 --> 05:25:58,671
MOVEMENT OVER CENTRAL MILLER 

9918
05:25:58,671 --> 05:25:58,905
COUNTY. 

9919
05:25:58,905 --> 05:26:00,207
NORTHEAST PARTS OF EARLY COUNTY 

9920
05:26:00,207 --> 05:26:02,108
AND THE SQUALLS ARE ROTATING 

9921
05:26:02,108 --> 05:26:05,512
BACK TOWARD DOTHAN AND JACKSON 

9922
05:26:05,512 --> 05:26:10,551
COUNTY WHERE THEY HIT 

9923
05:26:10,551 --> 05:26:12,753
PARTICULARLY HARD WITH NUMEROUS 

9924
05:26:12,753 --> 05:26:13,286
REPORTS OF DOWNED TREES. 

9925
05:26:13,286 --> 05:26:17,791
EVERYBODY WITHIN 70 MILES OF 

9926
05:26:17,791 --> 05:26:20,560
THE CENTER OF THE SYSTEM. 

9927
05:26:20,560 --> 05:26:22,563
THESE OTHER SQUALLS A LITTLE 

9928
05:26:22,563 --> 05:26:23,130
MORE REMOVED. 

9929
05:26:23,130 --> 05:26:24,865
TWO THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN. 

9930
05:26:24,865 --> 05:26:25,198
WELL THREE. 

9931
05:26:25,198 --> 05:26:26,967
YOU COULD GET SOME VERY HEAVY 

9932
05:26:26,967 --> 05:26:27,234
RAINFALL. 

9933
05:26:27,234 --> 05:26:28,769
AND SINCE THEY ARE TRAINING A 

9934
05:26:28,769 --> 05:26:30,170
LITTLE BIT FOLLOWING ALMOST THE 

9935
05:26:30,170 --> 05:26:35,008
SAME SPOT, YOU COULD SEE SOME 

9936
05:26:35,008 --> 05:26:37,644
FLASH FLOODING IN SPOTS. 

9937
05:26:37,644 --> 05:26:38,044
THAT'S PART ONE. 

9938
05:26:38,044 --> 05:26:40,547
PART TWO, THESE COULD FORM SOME 

9939
05:26:40,547 --> 05:26:41,047
OF THE STRONGER WINDS. 

9940
05:26:41,047 --> 05:26:42,849
YOU COULD SEE TROPICAL STORM 

9941
05:26:42,849 --> 05:26:44,451
WIND GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 40 

9942
05:26:44,451 --> 05:26:44,952
MILES AN HOUR. 

9943
05:26:44,952 --> 05:26:47,888
AND, CAN'T RULE OUT STILL THE 

9944
05:26:47,888 --> 05:26:49,356
POSSIBILITY FOR A FEW 

9945
05:26:49,356 --> 05:26:49,656
TORNADOES. 

9946
05:26:49,656 --> 05:26:52,859
WE'VE NOT SEEN THE ROTATING 

9947
05:26:52,859 --> 05:26:53,160
STORMS. 

9948
05:26:53,160 --> 05:26:54,560
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY. 

9949
05:26:54,560 --> 05:26:56,763
NOTICE HOW THE LINE EXTENDS 

9950
05:26:56,763 --> 05:26:57,631
DOWN THROUGH MADISON COUNTY. 

9951
05:26:57,631 --> 05:26:58,865
THOUGH WE'RE NOT SEEING MUCH 

9952
05:26:58,865 --> 05:27:00,500
COMING IN FROM THE COAST. 

9953
05:27:00,500 --> 05:27:02,436
THAT'S TYPICALLY OUR BIGGEST 

9954
05:27:02,436 --> 05:27:03,003
CONCERN WITH THOSE ROTATING 

9955
05:27:03,003 --> 05:27:05,739
STORMS BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO 

9956
05:27:05,739 --> 05:27:09,209
WATCH THESE THROUGHOUT TAYLOR, 

9957
05:27:09,209 --> 05:27:10,343
LAFAYETTE, SWANEE, HAMILTON. 

9958
05:27:10,343 --> 05:27:12,112
THEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT 

9959
05:27:12,112 --> 05:27:13,246
FURTHER TOWARD THE WEST. 

9960
05:27:13,246 --> 05:27:14,513
HERE'S THE OTHER STUFF ROTATING 

9961
05:27:14,513 --> 05:27:19,219
AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF JACKSON 

9962
05:27:19,219 --> 05:27:19,486
COUNTY. 

9963
05:27:19,486 --> 05:27:20,754
DOWN TO GADSTON AND LEON. 

9964
05:27:20,754 --> 05:27:24,124
THESE SQUALLS DON'T LOOK 

9965
05:27:24,124 --> 05:27:24,758
IMPRESSIVE ON RADAR, BUT COULD 

9966
05:27:24,758 --> 05:27:27,828
PRODUCE 50 MILES AN HOUR PLUS 

9967
05:27:27,828 --> 05:27:28,061
GUSTS. 

9968
05:27:28,061 --> 05:27:30,263
THE OVERALL WIND FIELD, YES, I 

9969
05:27:30,263 --> 05:27:32,766
KNOW IT'S GETTING LIGHTER BUT 

9970
05:27:32,766 --> 05:27:33,700
BE CAREFUL OF THE GUSTS. 

9971
05:27:33,700 --> 05:27:35,435
TREES WHICH MAY HAVE FALLEN 

9972
05:27:35,435 --> 05:27:36,002
THREE-FOURTHS OF THE WAY. 

9973
05:27:36,002 --> 05:27:39,339
ALL IT NEEDS IS ONE MORE GUST 

9974
05:27:39,339 --> 05:27:41,908
TO PUT IT DOWN INTO AN AREA 

9975
05:27:41,908 --> 05:27:42,909
NEAR YOUR HOME OR CAR. 

9976
05:27:42,909 --> 05:27:44,244
YOU DON'T WANT TO VENTURE OUT 

9977
05:27:44,244 --> 05:27:46,079
IF THOSE GUSTS ARE STILL AROUND 

9978
05:27:46,079 --> 05:27:46,279
YOU. 

9979
05:27:46,279 --> 05:27:49,649
INCLUDING THESE THAT ARE COMING 

9980
05:27:49,649 --> 05:27:52,653
UP THROUGH PARTS OF BRADFORD 

9981
05:27:52,653 --> 05:27:54,021
AND THE WEST SIDE OF 

9982
05:27:54,021 --> 05:27:54,354
TALLAHASSEE. 

9983
05:27:54,354 --> 05:27:58,358
A FEW OF THE SQUALLS COMING 

9984
05:27:58,358 --> 05:27:59,059
THROUGH QUINCY UP TOWARD 

9985
05:27:59,059 --> 05:28:00,027
CHATTAHOOCHEE. 

9986
05:28:00,027 --> 05:28:03,964
GO BACK OUT TO THE WIDER VIEW. 

9987
05:28:03,964 --> 05:28:07,567
GET A BETTER IDEA OF THE 

9988
05:28:07,567 --> 05:28:07,900
CIRCULATION. 

9989
05:28:07,900 --> 05:28:08,401
YOU GET SOUTH OF I-10. 

9990
05:28:08,401 --> 05:28:09,636
IT DOES DEFINITELY GET A LOT 

9991
05:28:09,636 --> 05:28:11,605
BETTER BUT WE'RE STILL WATCHING 

9992
05:28:11,605 --> 05:28:13,106
SOME OF THESE LITTLE BANDS, 

9993
05:28:13,106 --> 05:28:13,940
THESE SQUALLS COMING IN FROM 

9994
05:28:13,940 --> 05:28:15,075
THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

9995
05:28:15,075 --> 05:28:17,944
AND WE STILL HAVE A TORNADO 

9996
05:28:17,944 --> 05:28:20,080
WATCH IN EFFECT UNTIL 2:00, IT 

9997
05:28:20,080 --> 05:28:21,448
WILL LIKELY BE DISCONTINUED 

9998
05:28:21,448 --> 05:28:22,349
EARLIER THAN THAT, ESPECIALLY 

9999
05:28:22,349 --> 05:28:23,049
FOR THE BIG BEND. 

10000
05:28:23,049 --> 05:28:25,852
WE DON'T WANT TO PUT OUR GUARD 

10001
05:28:25,852 --> 05:28:28,154
DOWN AFTER ALL OF THIS. 

10002
05:28:28,154 --> 05:28:29,523
HAVEN'T HAD THE WARNINGS. 

10003
05:28:29,523 --> 05:28:33,460
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY. 

10004
05:28:33,460 --> 05:28:34,961
MANY STATIONS OFF THE GRID NOW, 

10005
05:28:34,961 --> 05:28:36,963
THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE WITH 

10006
05:28:36,963 --> 05:28:38,131
A LANDFALLING SYSTEM. 

10007
05:28:38,131 --> 05:28:40,667
YOU GET THE WIND DATA AND JUST 

10008
05:28:40,667 --> 05:28:43,370
AS THE WIND GETS STRONG, YOU 

10009
05:28:43,370 --> 05:28:43,637
LOSE IT. 

10010
05:28:43,637 --> 05:28:48,141
SO WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY NEW 

10011
05:28:48,141 --> 05:28:50,343
DATA COMING FROM THAT AREA. 

10012
05:28:50,343 --> 05:28:52,379
SUSTAINED WINDS OF 39 IN 

10013
05:28:52,379 --> 05:28:52,712
TALLAHASSEE. 

10014
05:28:52,712 --> 05:28:53,780
YOU MAY SAY THE WINDS ARE 

10015
05:28:53,780 --> 05:28:57,817
GETTING LIGHTER BUT THAT'S 

10016
05:28:57,817 --> 05:28:58,451
STILL TROPICAL STORM FORCE, 39 

10017
05:28:58,451 --> 05:29:00,086
MILES AN HOUR IS STILL THE 

10018
05:29:00,086 --> 05:29:02,756
BOTTOM END OF TROPICAL STORM 

10019
05:29:02,756 --> 05:29:03,690
WINDS. 

10020
05:29:03,690 --> 05:29:08,195
IN ALBANY, NOTICE THE DIRECTION 

10021
05:29:08,195 --> 05:29:10,096
COMING IN FROM THE EAST. 

10022
05:29:10,096 --> 05:29:12,132
SO, THERE'S YOUR CIRCULATION AS 

10023
05:29:12,132 --> 05:29:16,102
THE CENTER MOVES, AGAIN, OUT OF 

10024
05:29:16,102 --> 05:29:18,171
EARLY MILLER COUNTY RATHER INTO 

10025
05:29:18,171 --> 05:29:19,739
ROUGHLY EARLY BAKER COUNTY 

10026
05:29:19,739 --> 05:29:19,939
LINE. 

10027
05:29:19,939 --> 05:29:21,041
CHECKING OUT THE GUSTS, THESE 

10028
05:29:21,041 --> 05:29:22,375
ARE THE MOST RECENT GUSTS. 

10029
05:29:22,375 --> 05:29:25,078
61 MILES AN HOUR GUSTS. 

10030
05:29:25,078 --> 05:29:26,980
STILL IN TALLAHASSEE. 

10031
05:29:26,980 --> 05:29:29,816
GUST OF 78 IN ALBANY. 

10032
05:29:29,816 --> 05:29:31,651
THE POWER IS STILL THERE. 

10033
05:29:31,651 --> 05:29:35,956
GUSTING NEARLY 50 MILES AN HOUR 

10034
05:29:35,956 --> 05:29:36,289
IN VALDOSTA. 

10035
05:29:36,289 --> 05:29:37,390
THAT LITTLE SQUALL OF SHOWERS 

10036
05:29:37,390 --> 05:29:41,361
IS PROOF YOU'LL HAVE THE GUSTS 

10037
05:29:41,361 --> 05:29:42,796
THAT COULD EXCEED 40 TO PERHAPS 

10038
05:29:42,796 --> 05:29:43,496
50 MILES AN HOUR. 

10039
05:29:43,496 --> 05:29:45,966
THE BIG SATELLITE VIEW, YOU CAN 

10040
05:29:45,966 --> 05:29:47,500
SEE AN UNCOMFORTABLE LOOK AT 

10041

THAT THE WIRES THAT ARE DOWN. 

10224

THE STORMMENT WE WANT TO MAKE 

10237
05:35:38,184 --> 05:35:39,986

10290
05:39:18,905 --> 05:39:20,373
THE HURRICANE HAS SLOWED A BIT

10291

BUT IS STILL DELIVERING A HEAVY

10292
05:39:22,541 --> 05:39:25,311
EMPLOYEE AS IT MOVES INTO

LATEST?

10299

>> WE STILL HAVE A CATEGORY 3

10300
05:39:36,689 --> 05:39:39,559
STORM OR AT LEAST THAT WAS THE

10301
05:39:39,559 --> 05:39:40,526
CASE AT 6:58.

10302
05:39:40,526 --> 05:39:43,896
WE MAY GET AN UPDATE BHIEL --

10303
05:39:43,896 --> 05:39:44,497
WHILE WE ARE

10304
05:39:44,497 --> 05:39:45,631
ON THE AIR HERE.

10305
05:39:45,631 --> 05:39:46,265
THE STORM IS INTO GEORGIA AND

10306
05:39:46,265 --> 05:39:48,067
CONTINUING TO MOVE OFF TO THE

10307
05:39:48,067 --> 05:39:54,073
NORTH AND EAST AT A FAIRLY BRISK

10308
05:39:54,073 --> 05:39:54,273
CLIP.

10309
05:39:54,273 --> 05:39:56,542
115 MILE AN HOUR WINDS MOVING TO

10310
05:39:56,542 --> 05:39:57,710
THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AT 13 MILES

10311
05:39:57,710 --> 05:39:57,943
AN HOUR.

10312
05:39:57,943 --> 05:39:59,945
THEY HAVE CLEAR SKIES IN PANAMA

10313
05:39:59,945 --> 05:40:00,646
CITY AT THIS POINT.

10314
05:40:00,646 --> 05:40:03,483
THE BACK HALF OF THE STORM HAS

10315
05:40:03,483 --> 05:40:05,551
MOVED OFF THE COAST.

10316
05:40:05,551 --> 05:40:07,720
YOU STILL HAVE GOT -- A SOMEWHAT

10317
05:40:07,720 --> 05:40:08,520
DECENT EYE THERE.

10318
05:40:08,520 --> 05:40:10,456
IT HAS BEEN ERODING OVER THE

10319
05:40:10,456 --> 05:40:11,457
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS.

10320
05:40:11,457 --> 05:40:12,592
YOU SEEING THOSE DEEP ORANGES

10321
05:40:12,592 --> 05:40:13,192
AND REDS.

10322
05:40:13,192 --> 05:40:14,527
THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE HAVING THE

10323
05:40:14,527 --> 05:40:16,229
STRONGEST WIND AND ALSO THE

10324
05:40:16,229 --> 05:40:16,729
HEAVIEST RAIN.

10325
05:40:16,729 --> 05:40:18,898
>> WHAT DO PEOPLE NEED TO BE

10326
05:40:18,898 --> 05:40:20,166
MOST CONCERNED ABOUT AT THIS

10327
05:40:20,166 --> 05:40:20,466
POINT?

10328
05:40:20,466 --> 05:40:22,168
>> THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS GOING

10329
05:40:22,168 --> 05:40:25,471
TO BE ALL KINDS OF WIND CONCERNS

10330
05:40:25,471 --> 05:40:27,806
FROM POWER OUTAGES TO POTENTIAL

10331
05:40:27,806 --> 05:40:28,841
TORNADOS OVERNIGHT TONIGHT TO --

10332
05:40:28,841 --> 05:40:30,343
SOME OF THOSE WIND GUSTS THAT

10333
05:40:30,343 --> 05:40:32,211
COULD BE IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS

10334
05:40:32,211 --> 05:40:32,911
ALTHOUGH THOSE WILL BE BACKING

10335
05:40:32,911 --> 05:40:34,046
OFF FAIRLY QUICKLY AND THEN WE

10336
05:40:34,046 --> 05:40:37,583
TAKE A LOOK AT THE RAIN WITH

10337
05:40:37,583 --> 05:40:38,650
FLASH FLOOD WATCHES UP.

10338
05:40:38,650 --> 05:40:40,920
>> REMIND US HOW DID THIS

10339
05:40:40,920 --> 05:40:43,523
PARTICULAR STORM GET SO STRONG

10340
05:40:43,523 --> 05:40:44,090
SO QUICKLY?

10341
05:40:44,090 --> 05:40:45,558
>> WELL REALLY IT WAS SORT OF

10342
05:40:45,558 --> 05:40:47,293
THE PERFECT STORM IF YOU WILL.

10343
05:40:47,293 --> 05:40:49,161
WE HAD ALL OF THIS DRY AIR JUST

10344
05:40:49,161 --> 05:40:50,363
OFF TO THE WEST.

10345
05:40:50,363 --> 05:40:51,530
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

10346
05:40:51,530 --> 05:40:52,698
SATURDAYAL LITE MAP HERE, SEE

10347
05:40:52,698 --> 05:40:53,866
WHERE THAT GRAY IS OVER THERE?

10348
05:40:53,866 --> 05:40:55,200
THAT IS WHERE THE DRY AIR WAS.

10349
05:40:55,200 --> 05:40:57,203
THAT SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO MIX IN

10350
05:40:57,203 --> 05:40:58,770
BUT IT DIDN'T DO IT.

10351
05:40:58,770 --> 05:41:00,039
IT WAS OVER INCREDIBLY WARM

10352
05:41:00,039 --> 05:41:02,909
WATER AND WATCH -- YOU CAN SORT

10353
05:41:02,909 --> 05:41:07,046
OF SEE THE LIFT AROUND THE

10354
05:41:07,046 --> 05:41:07,279
CENTER.

10355
05:41:07,279 --> 05:41:08,781
THAT IS THE STORM BECOMING MORE

10356
05:41:08,781 --> 05:41:09,315
AND MORE ORGANIZED.

10357
05:41:09,315 --> 05:41:13,753
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MAP

10358
05:41:13,753 --> 05:41:15,688
AT THE START, AT 6:30 YESTERDAY,

10359
05:41:15,688 --> 05:41:17,390
OVER ABOUT THREE HOURS WE SAW

10360
05:41:17,390 --> 05:41:20,960
THIS EYE CLOSE OFF AND THIS JUST

10361
05:41:20,960 --> 05:41:21,460
RAPID INTENSIFICATION.

10362
05:41:21,460 --> 05:41:22,194
THAT IS WHEN WE REALIZED THIS IS

10363
05:41:22,194 --> 05:41:24,430
GOING TO BE A BEAST AND THEN IT

10364
05:41:24,430 --> 05:41:25,431
JUST KEPT GETTING STRONGER AND

10365
05:41:25,431 --> 05:41:26,899
STRONGER DURING THE DAY TO DAY.

10366
05:41:26,899 --> 05:41:28,634
>> WHAT'S THE PATH NOW?

10367
05:41:28,634 --> 05:41:29,402
WHERE IS THE STORM HEADED NEXT?

10368
05:41:29,402 --> 05:41:31,604
>> IN TERMS OF WHERE ITS HEADED

10369
05:41:31,604 --> 05:41:33,039
ITS GOING RIGHT OVER THE

10370
05:41:33,039 --> 05:41:34,206
CAROLINAS AND OUT THE

10371
05:41:34,206 --> 05:41:34,574
CHESAPEAKE.

10372
05:41:34,574 --> 05:41:35,907
IT WILL DO IT REALLY QUICKLY.

10373
05:41:35,907 --> 05:41:37,610
BY THE TIME YOU GET TO 2:00 A.M.

10374
05:41:37,610 --> 05:41:39,912
ON FRIDAY MORNING, ITS OFF THE

10375
05:41:39,912 --> 05:41:40,812
COAST OF NORFOLK.

10376
05:41:40,812 --> 05:41:42,949
SO THAT'S A PRETTY RAPID MOVE.

10377
05:41:42,949 --> 05:41:45,084
THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT OUT

10378
05:41:45,084 --> 05:41:45,484
OF HURRICANES.

10379
05:41:45,484 --> 05:41:46,519
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN ANY OF

10380
05:41:46,519 --> 05:41:48,721
THE LAST ONES THAT HAVE MADE

10381
05:41:48,721 --> 05:41:48,988
LANDFALL.

10382
05:41:48,988 --> 05:41:50,323
THE WINDS REALLY STARTING TO

10383
05:41:50,323 --> 05:41:50,590
BACK DOWN.

10384
05:41:50,590 --> 05:41:51,924
IN THE NEXT COME OF HOURS WE

10385
05:41:51,924 --> 05:41:54,193
WILL GO DOWN TO PROBABLY JUST A

10386
05:41:54,193 --> 05:41:54,827
TROPICAL STORM AT THAT POINT.

10387
05:41:54,827 --> 05:41:57,396
WE SEE A 2 THAT THERE.

10388
05:41:57,396 --> 05:41:59,098
THAT WOULD INDICATE THE WIND

10389
05:41:59,098 --> 05:42:00,700
SPEEDS HAVE KNOCKED DOWN BELOW

10390
05:42:00,700 --> 05:42:02,201
110 MILES AN HOUR.

10391
05:42:02,201 --> 05:42:02,534
THAT IS GOOD.

10392
05:42:02,534 --> 05:42:03,602
ITS STARTING TO WEAKEN.

10393
05:42:03,602 --> 05:42:04,604
THE KEY THING HERE IS THE RAIN

10394
05:42:04,604 --> 05:42:07,139

>> ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT AREAS

10417
05:42:41,874 --> 05:42:45,944
IS PANAMA CITY BEACH JUST WEST

10418
05:42:45,944 --> 05:42:46,812
OF WHERE MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL.

10419
05:42:46,812 --> 05:42:54,086
HERE IS SOME OF THE DAMAGE THE

10420
05:42:54,086 --> 05:42:57,990
WINDS DID THERE.

10421
05:42:57,990 --> 05:43:01,961
JEFF IS THERE WITH MORE.

10422
05:43:01,961 --> 05:43:06,065
>> THE SOUND UNMISTAKABLE, MORE

10423
05:43:06,065 --> 05:43:15,006
LIKE A JET LINER AT TAKEOFF.

10424
05:43:15,006 --> 05:43:15,908
>> OH MY GOD.

10425
05:43:15,908 --> 05:43:16,875
>> HERE IN PANAMA CITY BEACH WE

10426
05:43:16,875 --> 05:43:21,914
WERE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE

10427
05:43:21,914 --> 05:43:23,415
STORM AS IT BLASTED AWAY.

10428
05:43:23,415 --> 05:43:27,186
>> WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE

10429
05:43:27,186 --> 05:43:28,286
WORST OF HURRICANE MICHAEL.

10430
05:43:28,286 --> 05:43:30,556
THE CITY MANAGER TELLS US HE

10431
05:43:30,556 --> 05:43:32,058
THINKS ABOUT 50% OF RESIDENTS

10432
05:43:32,058 --> 05:43:32,491
HAVE LEFT TOWN.

10433
05:43:32,491 --> 05:43:36,262
AT THIS POINT THEY ARE NO LONGER

10434
05:43:36,262 --> 05:43:37,963
RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS.

10435
05:43:37,963 --> 05:43:38,998
IF SOMEONE HAS LIFE-THREATENING

10436
05:43:38,998 --> 05:43:42,468
EMERGENCY, THEY LIKELY WILL NOT

10437
05:43:42,468 --> 05:43:44,703
BE ABLE TO GET THERE.

10438
05:43:44,703 --> 05:43:46,338
>> WHEN MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL

10439
05:43:46,338 --> 05:43:48,140
ITS WINDS TOPPED OUT AT 155

10440

THAT IS JUST TO MILES AN HOUR

10442
05:43:51,410 --> 05:43:52,578

MANY WIND GAUGES BROKE.

10446
05:43:56,348 --> 05:44:06,025

10447
05:44:06,025 --> 05:44:10,630
RIGHT UP AGAINST ALL WINDOWS.

10448
05:44:10,630 --> 05:44:15,467

10449
05:44:15,467 --> 05:44:15,901
OFF BUILDINGS.

10450
05:44:15,901 --> 05:44:19,638

05:48:08,934 --> 05:48:10,836
THE BIG ISSUE IS GOING TO BE OF

10575
05:48:10,836 --> 05:48:11,469
COURSE CLEAN UP.

10576
05:48:11,469 --> 05:48:14,173
THAT IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM

10577
05:48:14,173 --> 05:48:14,473
THING.

10578
05:48:14,473 --> 05:48:15,207
WE HAVE SEEN TREES DOWN.

10579
05:48:15,207 --> 05:48:18,477
WE HAVE SEEN -- MATTER OF FACT,

10580
05:48:18,477 --> 05:48:20,512
PIECES OFFENSE THAT ARE

10581
05:48:20,512 --> 05:48:21,546
BASICALLY JUST STREWN ABOUT THAT

10582
05:48:21,546 --> 05:48:23,482
NEIGHBORHOOD AND ENDED UP IN

10583
05:48:23,482 --> 05:48:24,349
OTHER PEOPLE'S YARDS AS WELL.

10584
05:48:24,349 --> 05:48:25,551
THIS IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE

10585
05:48:25,551 --> 05:48:27,219
LONG TERM PROCESS OF THE CLEAN

10586
05:48:27,219 --> 05:48:27,453
UP.

10587
05:48:27,453 --> 05:48:28,787
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO SHOW

10588
05:48:28,787 --> 05:48:29,855
YOU OVER HERE, LET ME STEP OVER

10589
05:48:29,855 --> 05:48:33,158
HERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN SEE IT.

10590
05:48:33,158 --> 05:48:34,460
THE PANHANDLE HAS LOT OF THESE

10591
05:48:34,460 --> 05:48:35,227
BEAUTIFUL PINE TREES.

10592
05:48:35,227 --> 05:48:37,563
THEY ARE TALL AND THEY ARE

10593
05:48:37,563 --> 05:48:37,830
STRAIGHT.

10594
05:48:37,830 --> 05:48:39,531
GREAT DURING THE SUMMER BUT WHEN

10595
05:48:39,531 --> 05:48:41,600
ITS HURRICANE TIME, THEY WILL

10596
05:48:41,600 --> 05:48:46,705
SNAP IN HALF AND BRIN -- BRING

10597
05:48:46,705 --> 05:48:46,939
DOWN

10598
05:48:46,939 --> 05:48:47,672
ALL THE POWER LINES.

10599
05:48:47,672 --> 05:48:51,910
IT IS SNAPPED RIGHT IN THE

10600
05:48:51,910 --> 05:48:52,411
CENTER.

10601
05:48:52,411 --> 05:48:53,779
A LOT OF THESE ARE BLOCKING THE

10602
05:48:53,779 --> 05:48:53,979
ROADS.

10603
05:48:53,979 --> 05:49:00,352
AT THAT WILL BE A MAYOR JOR --

10604
05:49:00,352 --> 05:49:00,719
MAJOR

10605
05:49:00,719 --> 05:49:01,820
PART OF THE CLEAN UP

10606
05:49:01,820 --> 05:49:04,323
>> HAVE YOU SEEN FIRST

10607
05:49:04,323 --> 05:49:05,157
RESPONDERS OUT AND ABOUT?

10608
05:49:05,157 --> 05:49:07,292
>> WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM

10609
05:49:07,292 --> 05:49:07,625
TRICKLE OUT.

10610
05:49:07,625 --> 05:49:09,395
WE DID SEE SHERIFF DEPUTIES HERE

10611
05:49:09,395 --> 05:49:09,762
IN GULF COUNTY.

10612
05:49:09,762 --> 05:49:11,730
THEY WERE KIND OF CRUISING

10613
05:49:11,730 --> 05:49:13,065
AROUND BUT HAD BASICALLY LIMITED

10614
05:49:13,065 --> 05:49:15,134
CAPABILITIES OF WHAT THEY COULD

10615
05:49:15,134 --> 05:49:15,768
DO.

10616
05:49:15,768 --> 05:49:16,668
ONE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS

10617
05:49:16,668 --> 05:49:18,871
HERE TOLD US THAT -- THE

10618
05:49:18,871 --> 05:49:19,938
HOSPITALS ARE CLOSED.

10619
05:49:19,938 --> 05:49:22,140
ALL THE AMBULANCES ARE FARTHER

10620
05:49:22,140 --> 05:49:22,374
INLAND.

10621
05:49:22,374 --> 05:49:23,342
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL HELP IT

10622
05:49:23,342 --> 05:49:25,844
WON'T HAPPEN TILL AFTER THE

10623
05:49:25,844 --> 05:49:26,211
STORM.

10624
05:49:26,211 --> 05:49:29,415
WE DID SEE SOME PORT SAINT JOE

10625
05:49:29,415 --> 05:49:29,748
POLICE.

10626
05:49:29,748 --> 05:49:30,982
THEY HAD A REAL HIGH VEHICLE.

10627
05:49:30,982 --> 05:49:32,217
THEY WENT INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

10628
05:49:32,217 --> 05:49:32,851
BEHIND ME HERE.

10629
05:49:32,851 --> 05:49:34,753
SOME OF THESE HOMES WERE UNDER 4

10630
05:49:34,753 --> 05:49:35,354
FEET OF WATER.

10631
05:49:35,354 --> 05:49:37,156
WE WERE SEEING THEM DRIVE TO

10632
05:49:37,156 --> 05:49:37,622
THOSE AREAS.

10633
05:49:37,622 --> 05:49:39,091
WE SAW THEM PULL OUT AN ELDERLY

10634
05:49:39,091 --> 05:49:44,396
COUPLE P TAKE -- AND TAKE THEM

10635
05:49:44,396 --> 05:49:44,930
TO HIGHER GROUND.

10636
05:49:44,930 --> 05:49:46,198
THE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE COMING

10637
05:49:46,198 --> 05:49:46,698
OUT.

10638
05:49:46,698 --> 05:49:47,298
THE BIG THING PEOPLE WANT TO

10639
05:49:47,298 --> 05:49:49,101
SEE, THEY WANT TO SEE THE POWER

10640
05:49:49,101 --> 05:49:49,468
CREWS.

10641
05:49:49,468 --> 05:49:51,270
THEY WANT TO SEE THOSE ORANGE

10642
05:49:51,270 --> 05:49:53,939
FLASHING LIGHTS AND THOSE CHERRY

10643
05:49:53,939 --> 05:49:55,574
PICKERS CAUSE THAT MEANS

10644
05:49:55,574 --> 05:49:56,341
PROGRESS.

10645
05:49:56,341 --> 05:49:58,811
THAT MEANS SOON.

10646
05:49:58,811 --> 05:49:59,311
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE

10647
05:49:59,311 --> 05:49:59,645
ELECTRICITY.

10648
05:49:59,645 --> 05:50:00,646
>> HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK

10649
05:50:00,646 --> 05:50:01,647
TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THIS STORM

10650
05:50:01,647 --> 05:50:03,348
COMPARES TO OTHERS THAT MIGHT

10651
05:50:03,348 --> 05:50:03,948
HAVE HIT THE AREA?

10652
05:50:03,948 --> 05:50:09,588
>> THERE IS SOME PEOPLE WHO SAID

10653
05:50:09,588 --> 05:50:10,255
THEY REALLY COULDN'T COMPARE IT.

10654
05:50:10,255 --> 05:50:12,825
THERE WAS WIND THAT WAS A RAIN

10655
05:50:12,825 --> 05:50:20,232
EVENT AND IT KIND OF PERKED

10656
05:50:20,232 --> 05:50:21,332
PEOPLE'S EARS UP.

10657
05:50:21,332 --> 05:50:22,301
IT HAS BEEN DECADES SINCE

10658
05:50:22,301 --> 05:50:26,438
ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAS BEEN

10659
05:50:26,438 --> 05:50:28,307
THOUGHT OF IN THE AREA.

10660
05:50:28,307 --> 05:50:31,076
FOR HERE IN THIS AREA, PEOPLE

10661
05:50:31,076 --> 05:50:31,810
WERE LISTENING.

10662
05:50:31,810 --> 05:50:34,579
A LOT OF PEOPLE EVACUATED.

10663
05:50:34,579 --> 05:50:35,280
THEY WENT FARTHER INLAND.

10664
05:50:35,280 --> 05:50:37,149
INTERESTING NOTE THOUGH, IN PORT

10665
05:50:37,149 --> 05:50:38,584
SAINT JOE, THERE IS ABOUT 3500

10666
05:50:38,584 --> 05:50:43,355
PEOPLE AND -- SHERIFF DEPARTMENT

10667
05:50:43,355 --> 05:50:45,090
WAS TELLING US THAT ABOUT 60%

10668
05:50:45,090 --> 05:50:45,323
STAYED.

10669
05:50:45,323 --> 05:50:46,892
THEY STAYED IN THE AREA AND

10670
05:50:46,892 --> 05:50:48,227
DECIDED TO RIDE IT OUT.

10671
05:50:48,227 --> 05:50:49,795
WE ARE TRYING TO SEE IF THOSE

10672
05:50:49,795 --> 05:50:50,529
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME BACK.

10673
05:50:50,529 --> 05:50:51,563
THEY ARE COMING TO CHECK ON

10674
05:50:51,563 --> 05:50:51,930
THEIR PROPERTY.

10675
05:50:51,930 --> 05:50:54,466
THEY ARE COMING TO CHECK ON

10676
05:50:54,466 --> 05:50:55,200
THEIR BUSINESSES.

10677
05:50:55,200 --> 05:50:58,837
THEY ARE HAVING TO DO THAT FIRST

10678
05:50:58,837 --> 05:50:59,137
ASSESSMENT.

10679
05:50:59,137 --> 05:51:00,906
>> AND YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE ON

10680
05:51:00,906 --> 05:51:02,174
THE LOOK OUT FOR THOSE POWER

10681
05:51:02,174 --> 05:51:02,374
CREWS.

10682
05:51:02,374 --> 05:51:04,076
WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE

10683
05:51:04,076 --> 05:51:05,010
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE FOR

10684
05:51:05,010 --> 05:51:12,184
PEOPLE AS THEY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO

10685
05:51:12,184 --> 05:51:16,121
RECOVER ON?

10686
05:51:16,121 --> 05:51:17,322
>> IT IS.

10687
05:51:17,322 --> 05:51:19,591
THERE IS SOME PEOPLE -- WHO ARE

10688
05:51:19,591 --> 05:51:20,792
GOOD PREPPERS AND THEY HAVE

10689
05:51:20,792 --> 05:51:21,893
GENERATORS READY TO GO.

10690
05:51:21,893 --> 05:51:23,362
THEY WERE PART OF THAT CREW WHO

10691
05:51:23,362 --> 05:51:25,998
IS WAITING IN LINE AT A GAS

10692
05:51:25,998 --> 05:51:27,932
STATION TO FILL UP GAS TANKS.

10693
05:51:27,932 --> 05:51:28,700
THEY WERE MAYBE CHARGING THEIR

10694
05:51:28,700 --> 05:51:30,268
PHONES AND WHAT NOT IN CARS.

10695
05:51:30,268 --> 05:51:32,271
THERE IS NO CELL SIGNAL RIGHT

10696
05:51:32,271 --> 05:51:32,838
NOW HERE.

10697
05:51:32,838 --> 05:51:34,039
PRETTY MUCH DEAD IN THE AREA.

10698
05:51:34,039 --> 05:51:35,374
THE BIG CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE

10699
05:51:35,374 --> 05:51:36,408
FOR THE POWER CREWS, THEY WILL

10700
05:51:36,408 --> 05:51:39,244
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN

10701
05:51:39,244 --> 05:51:39,678
ROADS.

10702
05:51:39,678 --> 05:51:41,046
WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE CHAIN

10703
05:51:41,046 --> 05:51:43,081
SAW CREWS COME OUT FIRST, START

10704
05:51:43,081 --> 05:51:44,015
CLEARING SOME OF THE ROADS.

10705
05:51:44,015 --> 05:51:45,551
VOLUNTEERS HAVE STARTED DOING IT

10706
05:51:45,551 --> 05:51:45,784
AS WELL.

10707
05:51:45,784 --> 05:51:47,019
CLEARING SOME OF THOSE ROADS,

10708
05:51:47,019 --> 05:51:49,154
MOVING THE DEBRIS OFF THE ROADS

10709
05:51:49,154 --> 05:51:50,989
SO THOSE POWER CREWS CAN GO

10710
05:51:50,989 --> 05:51:53,191
DOWN, TAKE DOWN THE OLD LINES OR

10711
05:51:53,191 --> 05:51:55,494
PICK THEM UP, PUT A NEW POLE UP,

10712
05:51:55,494 --> 05:51:56,494
START STRINGING NEW CABLE UP AND

10713
05:51:56,494 --> 05:51:58,230
HOPEFULLY -- THEY KNOW IT WILL

10714
05:51:58,230 --> 05:51:58,663
BE SEVERAL DAYS.

10715
05:51:58,663 --> 05:52:00,065
THEY ARE JUST HOPING IT IS NOT

10716
05:52:00,065 --> 05:52:05,137
SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THEY GET

10717
05:52:05,137 --> 05:52:05,337
POWER.

10718
05:52:05,337 --> 05:52:05,837
>> THANK YOU.

10719
05:52:05,837 --> 05:52:06,771
>> THANK YOU, ELAINE.

10720
05:52:06,771 --> 05:52:08,874
>> WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO

10721
05:52:08,874 --> 05:52:12,344
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE

10722
05:52:12,344 --> 05:52:14,045
AFFILIATE FOR MORE ON THE STORM.

10723
05:52:14,045 --> 05:52:20,485
>> ITS STILL GUSTING TO 51 IN

10724
05:52:20,485 --> 05:52:20,986
TALLAHASSEE.

10725
05:52:20,986 --> 05:52:21,753
NEARLY THAT IN THOMASVILLE.

10726
05:52:21,753 --> 05:52:23,621
GUSTING TO NEARLY 70 MILES AN

10727
05:52:23,621 --> 05:52:24,989
HOUR IN ALBANY.

10728
05:52:24,989 --> 05:52:27,158
THIS IS STILL A POTENT STORM.

10729
05:52:27,158 --> 05:52:32,264
IT MIGHT BE HALF AS STRONG AS IT

10730
05:52:32,264 --> 05:52:39,304
TECHNICALLY WAS DOWN TOWARD THE

10731
05:52:39,304 --> 05:52:42,174
COAST.

10732
05:52:42,174 --> 05:52:43,275
IT IS TAIL DANGER -- DANGEROUS

10733
05:52:43,275 --> 05:52:43,609
ONE.

10734
05:52:43,609 --> 05:52:44,509
THE FUTURE CAST SHOWS HOW

10735
05:52:44,509 --> 05:52:45,410
QUICKLY THIS MOVES OUT.

10736
05:52:45,410 --> 05:52:46,678
BY THE TIME WE GET PAST

10737
05:52:46,678 --> 05:52:49,181
MIDNIGHT, THE CENTER IS LONG OUT

10738
05:52:49,181 --> 05:52:50,048
OF OUR VIEWING AREA.

10739
05:52:50,048 --> 05:53:02,194
STILL SOME BANDS MAY WRAP AROUND

10740
05:53:02,194 --> 05:53:02,995
PART OF THAT.

10741
05:53:02,995 --> 05:53:05,664
IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET BETTER

10742
05:53:05,664 --> 05:53:07,632
AND THEN IT EXIT IS AREA.

10743
05:53:07,632 --> 05:53:09,300
THE RAINFALL -- THE HEAVIEST BY

10744
05:53:09,300 --> 05:53:11,036
FAR WILL BE -- WITHIN ABOUT 50

10745
05:53:11,036 --> 05:53:14,739
MILES OR SO OF THE CENTER.

10746
05:53:14,739 --> 05:53:19,944
THAT IS ALBANY TO MULL TREE TO

10747
05:53:19,944 --> 05:53:21,313
EVEN BANE BRIDGE.

10748
05:53:21,313 --> 05:53:22,814
OVERALL THE 4 TO 8 INCHES IS

10749
05:53:22,814 --> 05:53:24,816
MORE OF TOTALS NOW AND CERTAINLY

10750
05:53:24,816 --> 05:53:25,584
NOT ADDITIONAL RAINFALL.

10751
05:53:25,584 --> 05:53:27,119
AN ADDITIONAL COUPLE OF INCHES

10752
05:53:27,119 --> 05:53:29,354
STILL A GOOD POSSIBILITY CLOSER

10753
05:53:29,354 --> 05:53:30,155
TO THAT CENTER.

10754
05:53:30,155 --> 05:53:32,090
THE WINDS ARE GRADUALLY DYING

10755
05:53:32,090 --> 05:53:32,290
DOWN.

10756
05:53:32,290 --> 05:53:33,325
ESPECIALLY DOWN TOWARD THE

10757
05:53:33,325 --> 05:53:33,659
COAST.

10758
05:53:33,659 --> 05:53:35,460
STILL A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED

10759
05:53:35,460 --> 05:53:35,827
TORNADO.

10760
05:53:35,827 --> 05:53:37,929
WE STILL HAVE SOME SURGE GOING

10761
05:53:37,929 --> 05:53:38,095
ON.

10762
05:53:38,095 --> 05:53:39,664
THAT PART HAS LIKELY PEAKED.

10763
05:53:39,664 --> 05:53:41,333
THE TIDE IS NOW GOING OUT.

10764
05:53:41,333 --> 05:53:42,067
WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS

10765
05:53:42,067 --> 05:53:43,702
THE WIND WILL START TO SHIFT

10766
05:53:43,702 --> 05:53:45,504
ENOUGH TO GRADUALLY START PUSH A

10767
05:53:45,504 --> 05:53:49,541
LITTLE MORE OF THAT WATER OFF

10768
05:53:49,541 --> 05:53:50,241
OUT OF THE FLOODED AREAS.

10769
05:53:50,241 --> 05:53:51,576
IT WILL TAKE THE REST OF TONIGHT

10770
05:53:51,576 --> 05:53:53,178
AND INTO TOMORROW BEFORE YOU CAN

10771
05:53:53,178 --> 05:53:54,946
START TALKING ACT SAFELY MOVING

10772
05:53:54,946 --> 05:53:56,048
AROUND IN THOSE AREAS THAT

10773
05:53:56,048 --> 05:53:57,783
RECEIVED ALL THE STORM SURGE

10774
05:53:57,783 --> 05:53:58,050
FLOODING.

10775
05:53:58,050 --> 05:54:00,051
WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU

BACK TO SOME PROGRAMMING.

10780
05:54:07,292 --> 05:54:10,228
WE WILL STILL HAVE UPDATES HERE

10781

>> I WAS JUST READING AN E-MAIL

10797
05:54:38,090 --> 05:54:40,092
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLANNING

AND SOME DAMAGE TO BE CLEANED UP

10803
05:54:47,732 --> 05:54:49,301

BEN IS NOW ABLE TO MOVE A LITTLE

10819
05:55:25,971 --> 05:55:26,137
BIT.

10820
05:55:26,137 --> 05:55:27,739
ARE YOUR DEPUTIES OUT ON THE

10821
05:55:27,739 --> 05:55:33,412
ROAD AGAIN AND WHAT HAVE THEY

10822
05:55:33,412 --> 05:55:33,645
SEEN?

10823
05:55:33,645 --> 05:55:34,279
>> I WAS LISTENING TO MIKE GIVE

10824
05:55:34,279 --> 05:55:37,582
THE RUN DOWN OF THE CURRENT

10825
05:55:37,582 --> 05:55:38,216
STATION.

10826
05:55:38,216 --> 05:55:39,618
DOWN HERE WE HAVE SEEN A

10827
05:55:39,618 --> 05:55:46,424
DECREASE IN THE SUSTAINED WINDS.

10828
05:55:46,424 --> 05:55:53,732
WE ARE STILL GETTING HEAVY GUSTS

10829
05:55:53,732 --> 05:55:54,132
QUITE FREAK EBTLY.

10830
05:55:54,132 --> 05:56:05,677
OUR -- FREAK EBT -- FREQUENTLY.

10831
05:56:05,677 --> 05:56:07,012
WE ARE CLEARING TREES AND DOWNED

10832
05:56:07,012 --> 05:56:07,212
LINES.

10833
05:56:07,212 --> 05:56:08,380
WE ARE HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH

10834
05:56:08,380 --> 05:56:09,781
NOW THAT EVERYBODY IS STARTING

10835
05:56:09,781 --> 05:56:11,983
TO SEE THE WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN,

10836
05:56:11,983 --> 05:56:16,488
EVERYBODY IS FLOODING N -- IN,

10837
05:56:16,488 --> 05:56:18,223
TRYING TO CHECK ON THEIR

10838
05:56:18,223 --> 05:56:18,690
PROPERTY.

10839
05:56:18,690 --> 05:56:20,559
ITS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME.

10840
05:56:20,559 --> 05:56:21,159
ALL THE WAY INTO TOMORROW

10841
05:56:21,159 --> 05:56:30,202
MORNING AND THE MIDDLE OF THE

10842
05:56:30,202 --> 05:56:30,602
MORNING TOMORROW.

10843
05:56:30,602 --> 05:56:35,373
WE HAVE GOT --

10844
05:56:35,373 --> 05:56:36,274
[ INDISCERNIBLE ]

10845
05:56:40,445 --> 05:56:43,581
CAN'T GET INTO SAINT CREEK.

10846
05:56:43,581 --> 05:56:44,249
IT IS UNDERWATER.

10847
05:56:44,249 --> 05:56:47,486
THERE IS -- THE RIVER IS -- GONE

10848
05:56:47,486 --> 05:56:49,353
OVER THE BANKS AT HIGHWAY 98

10849
05:56:49,353 --> 05:56:51,522
AND -- IT EXTENDS OUT ON TO 98.

10850
05:56:51,522 --> 05:56:54,125
WE HAVE -- THAT PORTION OF 98

10851
05:56:54,125 --> 05:56:54,593
LOCKED DOWN.

10852
05:56:54,593 --> 05:56:57,395
WE ARE REALLY DEALING WITH A LOT

10853
05:56:57,395 --> 05:56:59,831
OF -- LOGISTICS HERE THAT ITS

10854
05:56:59,831 --> 05:57:01,099
MAKING IT VERY TOUGH ESPECIALLY

10855
05:57:01,099 --> 05:57:02,834
WHEN WE HAVE A BUNCH OF

10856
05:57:02,834 --> 05:57:04,870
RESIDENTS TRYING TO RETURN TO

10857
05:57:04,870 --> 05:57:06,505
THEIR HOMES ON THE COASTAL AREA

10858
05:57:06,505 --> 05:57:11,710
AND -- IT'S JUST -- THEY CAN'T

10859
05:57:11,710 --> 05:57:12,277
GET DOWN THERE.

10860
05:57:12,277 --> 05:57:15,614
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING

10861
05:57:15,614 --> 05:57:18,283
THAT WILL LAST AT LEAST UNTIL

10862
05:57:18,283 --> 05:57:19,817
MID-MORNING TOMORROW BEFORE WE

10863
05:57:19,817 --> 05:57:20,685
CAN DETERMINE HOPEFULLY THAT

10864
05:57:20,685 --> 05:57:22,353
WATER WILL RECEDE WHERE MAYBE

10865
05:57:22,353 --> 05:57:23,555
YOU CAN START LETTING PEOPLE GO

10866
05:57:23,555 --> 05:57:24,189
BACK IN THERE

10867
05:57:24,189 --> 05:57:30,195
>> I KNOW, CHRIS, YOU HAD SOME

10868
05:57:30,195 --> 05:57:31,129
OTHER PROBLEMS BECAUSE -- YOU

10869
05:57:31,129 --> 05:57:33,231
OUTAGES AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.

10870
05:57:33,231 --> 05:57:35,499
YOU WERE UNABLE TO SEND OUT

10871
05:57:35,499 --> 05:57:36,301
INFORMATION AND KEEP

10872
05:57:36,301 --> 05:57:42,073
COMMUNICATION DURING THE STORM.

10873
05:57:42,073 --> 05:57:42,573
IS THAT STILL THE CASE?

10874
05:57:42,573 --> 05:57:51,716
>> IT SEEMS TO BE ONE THING

10875
05:57:51,716 --> 05:57:52,484
AFTER ANOTHER.

10876
05:57:52,484 --> 05:57:56,254
>> WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING

10877
05:57:56,254 --> 05:57:57,422
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE

10878
05:57:57,422 --> 05:57:58,122
AFFILIATE WCTV ON HURRICANE

05:57:58,122 --> 05:57:58,356
MICHAEL.

10880
05:57:58,356 --> 05:57:59,458
MUH MORE ON THE STORM

10881
05:57:59,458 --> 05:58:08,767
THROUGHOUT THE -- EVENING.

10882
05:58:08,767 --> 05:58:09,367
RIGHT NOW QUICK BREAK.

10883
05:58:09,367 --> 05:58:09,800
YOU STREAMING CBSN.

10884
06:00:18,196 --> 06:00:21,766
THE DOW JONES

10885
06:00:21,766 --> 06:00:23,334
PLUNGED MORE THAN 800 POINTS

10886
06:00:23,334 --> 06:00:23,601
WEDNESDAY.

10887
06:00:23,601 --> 06:00:27,605
WHILE THE S&P 500 SANK MORE THAN

10888
06:00:27,605 --> 06:00:28,372
90 POINTS.

10889
06:00:28,372 --> 06:00:29,641
TECH COMPANIES SAW THE SHARPEST

10890
06:00:29,641 --> 06:00:32,343
LOSSES AS ANALYSTS SAY INVESTORS

10891
06:00:32,343 --> 06:00:35,246
ARE WORRIED ABOUT RISING

10892
06:00:35,246 --> 06:00:35,713
INTEREST RATES.

10893
06:00:35,713 --> 06:00:36,815
MARTIN IS LONDON BUREAU CHIEF

10894
06:00:36,815 --> 06:00:37,916
AND HE JOINS ME NOW.

10895
06:00:37,916 --> 06:00:39,517
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.

10896
06:00:39,517 --> 06:00:41,086
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE SUCH A

10897
06:00:41,086 --> 06:00:42,186
LARGE DROP TODAY IN.

10898
06:00:42,186 --> 06:00:43,154
>> I REALLY WAS.

10899
06:00:43,154 --> 06:00:45,156
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE START OF

10900
06:00:45,156 --> 06:00:48,026
THE TRADING KIND OF IN AND OUT

10901
06:00:48,026 --> 06:00:48,726
OF POSITIVE TERRITORY.

10902
06:00:48,726 --> 06:00:49,126
AN ORDINARY DAY.

10903
06:00:49,126 --> 06:00:51,162
THE LOSSES BEGAN TO MOUNT AND

10904
06:00:51,162 --> 06:00:53,698
THEN SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ESCALATE

10905
06:00:53,698 --> 06:00:54,532
AND TUMBLE.

10906
06:00:54,532 --> 06:00:56,367
WE SAW THE SHARP DECLINES.

10907
06:00:56,367 --> 06:00:57,001
YOU MENTION TECH STOCKS.

10908
06:00:57,001 --> 06:00:59,270
THE NASDAQ HAD ITS WORST DAY

10909
06:00:59,270 --> 06:01:01,038
THERE SEVEN YEARS TODAY.

10910
06:01:01,038 --> 06:01:02,173
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING.

10911
06:01:02,173 --> 06:01:03,308
>> WHY IS THAT?

10912
06:01:03,308 --> 06:01:06,411
WHY DOES SOME TECH STOCKS SUFFER

10913
06:01:06,411 --> 06:01:06,778
BIG HITS?

10914
06:01:06,778 --> 06:01:10,315
>> THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO

10915
06:01:10,315 --> 06:01:11,149
RISING INTEREST RATES.

10916
06:01:11,149 --> 06:01:12,317
THE HIGHER THE INTEREST RATE AND

10917
06:01:12,317 --> 06:01:14,986
THE BORROWING THE COST THE MORE

10918
06:01:14,986 --> 06:01:16,487
PRESSURE THEIR PROFITS BECOMEúAL

10919
06:01:16,487 --> 06:01:19,991
FAKE SOME MONEY OUT -- TAKE SOME

10920
06:01:19,991 --> 06:01:20,892
MONEY OUT

10921
06:01:20,892 --> 06:01:22,126
OF THE MARKET AS RESULT.

10922
06:01:22,126 --> 06:01:24,129
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT

10923
06:01:24,129 --> 06:01:31,669
TAKING AS WE HEAD TO THE FINAL

10924
06:01:31,669 --> 06:01:31,903
MONTHS.

10925
06:01:31,903 --> 06:01:34,506
>> WELL SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

10926
06:01:34,506 --> 06:01:36,240
OTHER FACTORS THAT HELPED FUEL

10927
06:01:36,240 --> 06:01:36,574
THE SELL OFF?

10928
06:01:36,574 --> 06:01:37,708
>> THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IT TO

10929
06:01:37,708 --> 06:01:40,478
DAY WHEN WE WAS CRITICAL OF THE

10930
06:01:40,478 --> 06:01:41,613
FEDERAL RESERVE AND THEIR

10931
06:01:41,613 --> 06:01:42,447
INTEREST RATE POLICY.

10932
06:01:42,447 --> 06:01:43,848
HE THINKS HE IS MOVING TOO FAST.

10933
06:01:43,848 --> 06:01:48,553
THERE ARE SOME THAT AGREE AND

10934
06:01:48,553 --> 06:01:49,387
THERE ARE OTHERS THAT DON'T.

06:01:49,387 --> 06:01:50,421
IT WILL PROBABLY THAT INTO THE

END OF THE YEAR AND PROBABLY

10937
06:01:52,590 --> 06:01:53,358
INTO NEXT.

WE ARE EARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE

10941
06:01:57,662 --> 06:01:58,630
EVERY WEEK.

10942
06:01:58,630 --> 06:01:59,564
INFLATION IS PRETTY TAME.

10943
06:01:59,564 --> 06:02:00,999
THE FED IS MOVING MAYBE A LITTLE

10944
06:02:00,999 --> 06:02:02,367
MORE QUICKLY FOR SOME AND MAYBE

10945
06:02:02,367 --> 06:02:03,802
NOT AS QUICK FOR OTHERS BECAUSE

10946
06:02:03,802 --> 06:02:05,636
THEY LOOK BACK TO THE FINANCIAL

10947
06:02:05,636 --> 06:02:07,405
CRISIS AND THINK -- FED WAS A

10948
06:02:07,405 --> 06:02:08,973
LITTLE SLOW BACK THEN AND LOOK

10949
06:02:08,973 --> 06:02:09,306
WHAT HAPPENED.

10950
06:02:09,306 --> 06:02:14,345
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, THE DOW

10951
06:02:14,345 --> 06:02:16,781
IS STILL AT A RECORD LEVEL.

10952
06:02:16,781 --> 06:02:19,250
IS THIS JUST A BLIP ON THE RADAR

10953
06:02:19,250 --> 06:02:19,584
SCREEN?

10954
06:02:19,584 --> 06:02:20,818
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL

10955
06:02:20,818 --> 06:02:22,921
HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY, HOW DOES

10956
06:02:22,921 --> 06:02:24,789
THAT PICTURE LOOK?

10957
06:02:24,789 --> 06:02:26,758

10958
06:02:26,758 --> 06:02:27,091
TERRIBLY WELL.

10959
06:02:27,091 --> 06:02:28,426
WE WILL PROBABLY SEE CORPORATE

10960
06:02:28,426 --> 06:02:30,095
PROFITS AROUND THIS QUARTER RISE

10961
06:02:30,095 --> 06:02:31,029
AROUND 20% AND AGAIN FOR THE

10962
06:02:31,029 --> 06:02:37,802
FINAL THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

10963
06:02:37,802 --> 06:02:38,970
THAT IS REALLY HEALTHY EARNINGS.

10964
06:02:38,970 --> 06:02:44,542
WHAT INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED

10965
06:02:44,542 --> 06:02:46,611

06:02:47,311 --> 06:02:51,015
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ON

10968

10970
06:02:53,117 --> 06:02:58,456
AT THE MOMENT THEY SIT AT $250

10971
06:02:58,456 --> 06:02:58,857
BILLION.

10972
06:02:58,857 --> 06:03:03,228
THEY WOULD RISE TO $500 BILLION

10973
06:03:03,228 --> 06:03:05,296
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

10974
06:03:05,296 --> 06:03:07,232
THAT COULD HAVE A REALLY

10975
06:03:07,232 --> 06:03:07,999
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CONSUMER

10976
06:03:07,999 --> 06:03:09,200

10977
06:03:09,200 --> 06:03:10,301
CASCADING EFFECT INTO STOCKS AND

10978
06:03:10,301 --> 06:03:10,668
EVERYTHING ELSE.

10979
06:03:10,668 --> 06:03:12,069
WE MAY NOT KNOW THE TRUE STORY

10980
06:03:12,069 --> 06:03:13,170
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW.

10981
06:03:13,170 --> 06:03:18,609
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE FIRST

10982
06:03:18,609 --> 06:03:19,009
WARNING SIGNS.

10983
06:03:19,009 --> 06:03:20,144

10986
06:03:22,213 --> 06:03:22,747
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

10987
06:03:22,747 --> 06:03:24,783
I THINK WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE

10988
06:03:24,783 --> 06:03:27,118
FASCINATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS

10989
06:03:27,118 --> 06:03:27,885

WAR.

10994
06:03:39,229 --> 06:03:40,932
WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN

10995
06:03:40,932 --> 06:03:42,000
IS WITH THE BANK EARNINGS

NUMBERS.

11001
06:03:50,841 --> 06:03:52,176

11003
06:03:52,376 --> 06:03:54,412

11005
06:03:55,646 --> 06:03:58,950

CORRECTION.

11007
06:03:59,651 --> 06:04:04,722
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HURT TO

11008

11034
06:04:53,471 --> 06:04:55,439

06:15:00,911 --> 06:15:03,080
>> ONE THING NOTE ABOUT THIS

11295
06:15:03,080 --> 06:15:05,716
OP-ED IS IT DOESN'T STAND UP TO

11296
06:15:05,716 --> 06:15:11,322
SCRUTINY FROM A FACTUAL

11297
06:15:11,322 --> 06:15:11,622
STANDPOINT.

11298
06:15:11,622 --> 06:15:13,557
THERE IS ALL SORTS OF FACT

11299
06:15:13,557 --> 06:15:14,725
CHECKS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.

11300
06:15:14,725 --> 06:15:16,560
THE FACTS ON THE -- DEMOCRATS

11301
06:15:16,560 --> 06:15:19,396
PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE ARE NOT UP

11302
06:15:19,396 --> 06:15:19,763
TO SNUFF.

11303
06:15:19,763 --> 06:15:20,531
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS HEALTH

11304
06:15:20,531 --> 06:15:29,940
CARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADS,

11305
06:15:29,940 --> 06:15:32,776
HEALTH CARE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

11306
06:15:32,776 --> 06:15:34,477
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

11307
06:15:34,477 --> 06:15:35,111
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT.

11308
06:15:35,111 --> 06:15:36,180
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLEARLY

11309
06:15:36,180 --> 06:15:37,648
SEEING THAT AND GETTING HIS

11310
06:15:37,648 --> 06:15:40,317
MESSAGE OUT IN WHAT YOU -- IT IS

11311
06:15:40,317 --> 06:15:43,087
A RARE THING FOR HIM TO WRITE AN

11312
06:15:43,087 --> 06:15:43,420
OP-ED.

11313
06:15:43,420 --> 06:15:45,589
>> SO THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING

11314
06:15:45,589 --> 06:15:47,057
MULTIPLE RALLIES THIS WEEK.

11315
06:15:47,057 --> 06:15:48,792
ON TUESDAY HE WAS IN IOWA.

11316
06:15:48,792 --> 06:15:51,261
LET'S LISTEN TO SOME OF WHAT HE

11317
06:15:51,261 --> 06:15:51,629
SAID.

11318
06:15:51,629 --> 06:15:56,266
>> A VOTE FOR US IS A VOTE FOR

11319
06:15:56,266 --> 06:15:58,035
LOWER TAXES, LESS REGULATION,

11320
06:15:58,035 --> 06:16:00,004
AND MORE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE

11321
06:16:00,004 --> 06:16:01,972
RIGHT HERE IN THE USA.

11322
06:16:01,972 --> 06:16:04,875
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.

11323
06:16:04,875 --> 06:16:08,879
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE

11324
06:16:08,879 --> 06:16:11,414
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.

11325
06:16:11,414 --> 06:16:16,253
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG

11326
06:16:16,253 --> 06:16:16,854
AGAIN.

11327
06:16:16,854 --> 06:16:20,724
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.

11328
06:16:20,724 --> 06:16:23,527
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT

11329
06:16:23,527 --> 06:16:23,727
AGAIN.

11330
06:16:23,727 --> 06:16:25,595
>> ALL RIGHT, SO THE PRESIDENT'S

11331
06:16:25,595 --> 06:16:26,997
MESSAGE THERE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY

11332
06:16:26,997 --> 06:16:29,266
CLEAR THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR

11333
06:16:29,266 --> 06:16:31,335
REPUBLICANS, THEY WILL HELP ME

11334
06:16:31,335 --> 06:16:31,668
IN WASHINGTON.

11335
06:16:31,668 --> 06:16:34,304
DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW

11336
06:16:34,304 --> 06:16:35,739
EFFECTIVE THAT PARTICULAR

11337
06:16:35,739 --> 06:16:36,806
STRATEGY MIGHT BE IN.

11338
06:16:36,806 --> 06:16:38,375
>> IT VARIES QUITE BIT.

11339
06:16:38,375 --> 06:16:40,344
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THESE

11340
06:16:40,344 --> 06:16:43,514
REPUBLICANS WHOSE RUNNING IN A

11341
06:16:43,514 --> 06:16:46,050
PRO-TRUMP DISTRICT BUT FACING A

11342
06:16:46,050 --> 06:16:47,384
TOUGH CHALLENGE, TRUMP COMING

11343
06:16:47,384 --> 06:16:49,420
INTO TOWN BOOSTING TURN UP,

11344
06:16:49,420 --> 06:16:50,587
TRYING TO CLOSE THAT ENTHUSIASM

11345
06:16:50,587 --> 06:16:53,023
GAP WITH DEMOCRATS IS A GOOD

11346
06:16:53,023 --> 06:16:53,457
THING.

11347
06:16:53,457 --> 06:16:57,094
THEN AGAIN TRUMP IS NOT THE MOST

11348
06:16:57,094 --> 06:16:57,828
POPULAR PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD.

11349
06:16:57,828 --> 06:16:59,897
IF YOU ARE RUNNING IN A DISTRICT

11350
06:16:59,897 --> 06:17:01,899
THAT'S REALLY A TOSS UP, HALF

11351
06:17:01,899 --> 06:17:02,899
REPUBLICAN, HALF DEMOCRATS, YOU

11352
06:17:02,899 --> 06:17:04,068
MIGHT WANT TO MAKE THIS RACE

11353
06:17:04,068 --> 06:17:05,836
MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU

11354
06:17:05,836 --> 06:17:08,472
THINK ARE GOOD FOR YOU.

11355
06:17:08,472 --> 06:17:11,075
THE ECONOMY, ABOUT TAXES, THE

11356
06:17:11,075 --> 06:17:12,442
TAX CUTS.

11357
06:17:12,442 --> 06:17:13,076
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT PRESIDENT

11358
06:17:13,076 --> 06:17:15,779
TRUMP COMING TO TOWN AND MAKING

11359
06:17:15,779 --> 06:17:18,449
THIS ALL ABOUT HIM AND INJECTING

11360
06:17:18,449 --> 06:17:19,983
EVEN MORE -- CONTROVERSY INTO

11361
06:17:19,983 --> 06:17:20,216
THINGS.

11362
06:17:20,216 --> 06:17:22,886
>> WELL, SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

11363
06:17:22,886 --> 06:17:26,256
ERIC HOLDER WHO SAID THIS ON

11364
06:17:26,256 --> 06:17:26,790
WEDNESDAY.

11365
06:17:26,790 --> 06:17:28,892
QUOTE, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK

11366
06:17:28,892 --> 06:17:29,526
THEM.

11367
06:17:29,526 --> 06:17:31,428
WHEN WAS OF COURSE A PLAY ON

11368
06:17:31,428 --> 06:17:32,463
MICHELLE OBAMA'S NOW FAMOUS

11369
06:17:32,463 --> 06:17:35,899
QUOTE WHEN THEY GO LOW WE GO

11370
06:17:35,899 --> 06:17:36,266
HIGH.

11371
06:17:36,266 --> 06:17:38,902
THIS WAS FASCINATING TO ME

11372
06:17:38,902 --> 06:17:39,870
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORMER

11373
06:17:39,870 --> 06:17:40,738
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY

11374
06:17:40,738 --> 06:17:43,240
GENERAL -- SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE

11375
06:17:43,240 --> 06:17:45,642
TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF

11376
06:17:45,642 --> 06:17:46,710
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

11377
06:17:46,710 --> 06:17:50,113
SAYING THIS, WHAT -- WHAT ARE

11378
06:17:50,113 --> 06:17:52,649
YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT ERIC HOLDER

11379
06:17:52,649 --> 06:17:53,717
SORT OF TAKING THIS APPROACH

11380
06:17:53,717 --> 06:17:57,454
úAHO

11381
06:17:57,454 --> 06:17:59,790
YOU THINK OTHER DEMOCRATS FEEL

11382
06:17:59,790 --> 06:18:00,924
ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR TACTIC?

11383
06:18:00,924 --> 06:18:02,760
>> WHEN I SAW THIS QUOTE POP UP

11384
06:18:02,760 --> 06:18:04,228
IN MY TWITTER FEED I HAD TO GO

11385
06:18:04,228 --> 06:18:07,030
AND FIND THE CLIP BECAUSE I WAS

11386
06:18:07,030 --> 06:18:07,965
SO SHOCKED BY THE QUOTE I WANTED

11387
06:18:07,965 --> 06:18:10,734
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE

11388
06:18:10,734 --> 06:18:11,868
GETTING IT RIGHT.

11389
06:18:11,868 --> 06:18:13,336
THEY WERE GETTING IT RIGHT.

11390
06:18:13,336 --> 06:18:15,239
ERIC HOLDER DID SAY THIS.

11391
06:18:15,239 --> 06:18:17,107
THIS COMES AFTER HILLARY CLINTON

11392
06:18:17,107 --> 06:18:19,176
SAID THE TIME FOR CIVILITY IS

11393
06:18:19,176 --> 06:18:19,409
OVER.

11394
06:18:19,409 --> 06:18:26,850
WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE

11395
06:18:26,850 --> 06:18:30,621
MAJORITIES AND FIGHT, FIGHT.

11396
06:18:30,621 --> 06:18:33,457
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT

11397
06:18:33,457 --> 06:18:34,891
WHO IS SAYING THESE THINGS.

11398
06:18:34,891 --> 06:18:35,592
ITS PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

11399
06:18:35,592 --> 06:18:39,429
I GUESS IT SHOWS PEOPLE THINK

11400
06:18:39,429 --> 06:18:41,565
THE MORAL HIGH GROUND IS ONLY

11401
06:18:41,565 --> 06:18:44,568
WORTH SO MUCH.

11402
06:18:44,568 --> 06:18:45,669
THEY ARE TIRED OF LOSING.

11403
06:18:45,669 --> 06:18:47,070
HE'S BEEN SNIPING FROM THE

11404
06:18:47,070 --> 06:18:49,106
FRINGES AND SAYING WE NEED TO

11405
06:18:49,106 --> 06:18:49,840
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

11406
06:18:49,840 --> 06:18:51,441
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF

11407
06:18:51,441 --> 06:18:54,077
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ON

11408
06:18:54,077 --> 06:18:54,944
THE BALLOT TAKE THAT MESSAGE

11409
06:18:54,944 --> 06:18:57,881
BECAUSE IF SO IT WILL BE AN EVEN

11410
06:18:57,881 --> 06:18:58,816
UGLIER POLITICAL CYCLE THAN WHAT

11411
06:18:58,816 --> 06:18:59,817
WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR.

11412
06:18:59,817 --> 06:19:01,919
>> WHAT ELSE ARE WE SEEING FROM

11413
06:19:01,919 --> 06:19:03,220
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIRE

11414
06:19:03,220 --> 06:19:06,090
UP THEIR BASE AS WE HAVE SEEN

11415
06:19:06,090 --> 06:19:09,326
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO FIRE UP

11416
06:19:09,326 --> 06:19:09,626
THEIR SIDE?

11417
06:19:09,626 --> 06:19:09,993
>> IT VARIES.

11418
06:19:09,993 --> 06:19:11,795
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO

11419
06:19:11,795 --> 06:19:13,797
ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT

11420
06:19:13,797 --> 06:19:13,997
TRUMP.

11421
06:19:13,997 --> 06:19:15,499
WE RAN STRICTLY AGAINST TRUMP

11422
06:19:15,499 --> 06:19:15,766
LAST TIME.

11423
06:19:15,766 --> 06:19:16,733
AND WE LOST.

11424
06:19:16,733 --> 06:19:22,306
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US,

11425
06:19:22,306 --> 06:19:22,839
WHAT WE STAND FOR.

11426
06:19:22,839 --> 06:19:25,008
THERE IS ALSO JUST SO MUCH ANGER

11427
06:19:25,008 --> 06:19:25,475
IN THE BASE.

11428
06:19:25,475 --> 06:19:27,644
PEOPLE ARE FURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS

11429
06:19:27,644 --> 06:19:29,713
HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AND

11430
06:19:29,713 --> 06:19:30,947
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.

11431
06:19:30,947 --> 06:19:33,116
PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT AS

11432
06:19:33,116 --> 06:19:33,316
WELL.

11433
06:19:33,316 --> 06:19:35,385
SO I THINK ITS GOING TO BE A

11434
06:19:35,385 --> 06:19:37,187
TEST FOR PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY

11435
06:19:37,187 --> 06:19:37,988
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020.

11436
06:19:37,988 --> 06:19:39,923
ARE YOU GOING TO ONE OF THESE

11437
06:19:39,923 --> 06:19:41,024
PEOPLE THAT RUNS ANGRY OR ARE

11438
06:19:41,024 --> 06:19:45,996
YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF THESE

11439
06:19:45,996 --> 06:19:46,696
PEOPLE THAT RUNS WITH IDEAS?

11440
06:19:46,696 --> 06:19:49,499
>> LETS TURN TO ANOTHER ISSUE

11441
06:19:49,499 --> 06:19:50,200
HERE.

11442
06:19:50,200 --> 06:19:51,401
NIKKI HALEY RESIGNED TUESDAY AS

11443
06:19:51,401 --> 06:19:54,204
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. OR SHE

11444
06:19:54,204 --> 06:19:56,874
ANNOUNCED HER PLANS TO RESIGN.

11445
06:19:56,874 --> 06:19:58,008
SHE'S NOT LEAVING TILL THE END

11446
06:19:58,008 --> 06:19:58,608
OF THE YEAR.

11447
06:19:58,608 --> 06:20:01,011
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

11448
06:20:01,011 --> 06:20:01,578
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN

11449
06:20:01,578 --> 06:20:01,811
POLICY?

11450
06:20:01,811 --> 06:20:05,449
>> WELL FIRST OF ALL HE HAS A

11451
06:20:05,449 --> 06:20:06,483
FIND A REPLACEMENT.

11452
06:20:06,483 --> 06:20:07,818
MY COLLEAGUES ARE REPORTING THAT

11453
06:20:07,818 --> 06:20:09,720
POWELL, SHE WAS THE DEPUTY

11454
06:20:09,720 --> 06:20:10,954
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, SHE

11455
06:20:10,954 --> 06:20:11,755
LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION.

11456
06:20:11,755 --> 06:20:14,524
SHE APPEARS TO BE THE FRONT

11457
06:20:14,524 --> 06:20:16,025
RUNNER IF SHE WANTS THE JOB.

11458
06:20:16,025 --> 06:20:17,527
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW NIKKI HALEY IS

11459
06:20:17,527 --> 06:20:18,227
AN INTERESTING CASE BECAUSE SHE

11460
06:20:18,227 --> 06:20:21,031
IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO

11461
06:20:21,031 --> 06:20:22,199
SERVED IN THIS ADMINISTRATION

11462
06:20:22,199 --> 06:20:23,967
AND CAME OUT WITH SORT OF HER

11463
06:20:23,967 --> 06:20:25,636
STAR BURNING BRIGHTER THAN WHEN

11464
06:20:25,636 --> 06:20:27,938
SHE CAME INTO THE

11465
06:20:27,938 --> 06:20:28,438
ADMINISTRATION.

11466
06:20:28,438 --> 06:20:29,239
SHE IS SOMEBODY WITH NATIONAL

11467
06:20:29,239 --> 06:20:29,640
AMBITIONS.

11468
06:20:29,640 --> 06:20:30,907
OBVIOUSLY THE PART OF WHAT

11469
06:20:30,907 --> 06:20:32,910
PEOPLE IN TRUMP WORLD WANTED TO

11470
06:20:32,910 --> 06:20:34,711
DO WAS DOWN THE IDEA THAT SHE

11471
06:20:34,711 --> 06:20:36,146
WAS GOING BE CHALLENGING

11472
06:20:36,146 --> 06:20:36,546
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

11473
06:20:36,546 --> 06:20:37,047
SHE DID THAT HERSELF.

11474
06:20:37,047 --> 06:20:38,648
SHE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON

11475
06:20:38,648 --> 06:20:44,021
THE BALLOT AT ANY LEVEL IN 2020.

11476
06:20:44,021 --> 06:20:44,655
I WILL SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.

11477
06:20:44,655 --> 06:20:46,990

>> POWER WILL BE OUT FOR WEEKS.

11501
06:21:30,167 --> 06:21:33,303
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO PUT THIS

11502
06:21:33,303 --> 06:21:33,670
BACK TOGETHER.

11503
06:21:33,670 --> 06:21:34,771
>> SO THEY ARE REPORTING THAT

11504
06:21:34,771 --> 06:21:37,274
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

11505
06:21:37,274 --> 06:21:40,644
HURRICANES EVER TO HIT OUR

11506
06:21:40,644 --> 06:21:40,877
COUNTRY.

11507
06:21:40,877 --> 06:21:41,411
IS THAT A FACT?

11508
06:21:41,411 --> 06:21:43,714
>> WELL -- SO -- IN THIS AREA,

11509
06:21:43,714 --> 06:21:46,016
THIS WOULD BE THE MOST INTENSE

11510
06:21:46,016 --> 06:21:48,185
HURRICANE THAT'S STRUCK THIS

11511
06:21:48,185 --> 06:21:49,386
AREA SINCE 1851.

11512
06:21:49,386 --> 06:21:50,887

11518
06:22:03,000 --> 06:22:07,104
YEARS, FEMA IS UNDER

11519
06:22:07,104 --> 06:22:08,304
CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE.

11520
06:22:08,304 --> 06:22:14,177
>> IS FEMA STRETCHED THIN?

11521
06:22:14,177 --> 06:22:14,410
>> YES.

11522
06:22:14,410 --> 06:22:27,057

06:22:27,057 --> 06:22:27,390
INSIDE AGENCY.

11524
06:22:27,390 --> 06:22:29,059
>> AND THAT IS MAGNIFIED BECAUSE

11525
06:22:29,059 --> 06:22:30,093
FIVE MONTHS INTO THE HURRICANE

11526
06:22:30,093 --> 06:22:33,030

11550
06:23:12,802 --> 06:23:15,205
GEORGIA AND ITS GOING TO

11551
06:23:15,205 --> 06:23:16,573

GOING TO BE FROM WIND ALONG A

11563
06:23:35,325 --> 06:23:36,459
NARROW PATH ALONG THE CENTER.

11564
06:23:36,459 --> 06:23:37,427
THIS AREA OF GEORGIA IS HEAVILY

11565
06:23:37,427 --> 06:23:39,162
WOODED AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT

11566
06:23:39,162 --> 06:23:40,797
OF WIND IN THAT INLAND AREA

11567
06:23:40,797 --> 06:23:44,067

RAINFALL TOTALS ALONG THE PATH.

11573

THERE IS STILL SOME RESIDUAL

11621

WIND.

11622
06:27:23,953 --> 06:27:25,488
IT'S SO DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW.

11623
06:27:25,488 --> 06:27:26,523
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME OUTSIDE

DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE STORM

11625
06:27:27,724 --> 06:27:29,726
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO

11626
06:27:29,726 --> 06:27:30,193
DANGEROUS.

11627
06:27:30,193 --> 06:27:31,961
WE WATCHED FROM OUR HOTEL ROOM

11628
06:27:31,961 --> 06:27:34,064
AS THE WIND SNAPPED ACROSS THE

WHERE YOU RIGHT NOW?

11640

THE RESTORING POWER IS HIS

11650
06:28:15,071 --> 06:28:15,704

06:28:23,212 --> 06:28:24,180
>> RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE STARTING

11655
06:28:24,180 --> 06:28:26,716
TO GET OUT AND SURVEY THE

11656
06:28:26,716 --> 06:28:27,150
DAMAGE.

11657
06:28:27,150 --> 06:28:27,784
THIS ROAD HAS BEEN VERY QUIET.

11658
06:28:27,784 --> 06:28:33,757
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE

11659
06:28:33,757 --> 06:28:34,024
DRIVE BY.

11660
06:28:34,024 --> 06:28:35,292
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THE

11661
06:28:35,292 --> 06:28:37,260
GOVERNOR SAID THEY WOULD NOT BE

11662
06:28:37,260 --> 06:28:37,994
RESCUING PEOPLE.

11663
06:28:37,994 --> 06:28:39,696
NOW WE KNOW THOSE EMERGENCY

11664
06:28:39,696 --> 06:28:40,897
MANAGEMENT SERVICE CREWS ARE OUT

11665
06:28:40,897 --> 06:28:41,564
IN THE COMMUNITY.

11666
06:28:41,564 --> 06:28:42,231
THEY ARE SURVEYING THE DAMAGE TO

11667
06:28:42,231 --> 06:28:43,833
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING

11668
06:28:43,833 --> 06:28:44,067
ON.

11669
06:28:44,067 --> 06:28:45,901
AS THEY ARE DOING THAT WE ARE

11670
06:28:45,901 --> 06:28:46,569
ALSO NOTICING RESIDENTS ARE

11671
06:28:46,569 --> 06:28:48,771
COMING OUT THE GET A SENSE OF

11672
06:28:48,771 --> 06:28:49,539
HOW IMPACTFUL THIS STORM WAS.

11673
06:28:49,539 --> 06:28:51,574
>> AND HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO

11674
06:28:51,574 --> 06:28:53,476
TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT HOW THIS

11675
06:28:53,476 --> 06:28:57,480
MIGHT COMPARE TO OTHER STORMS

11676
06:28:57,480 --> 06:28:59,148
THAT HAVE HIT THE AREA?

11677
06:28:59,148 --> 06:28:59,448
>> WE HAVE.

11678
06:28:59,448 --> 06:29:01,084
I THINK UNIVERSALLY THE ONE

11679
06:29:01,084 --> 06:29:03,620
THING PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS THIS

11680
06:29:03,620 --> 06:29:04,454
HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.

11681
06:29:04,454 --> 06:29:06,055
FOR SOMETHING LIKE MARIA OR IRMA

11682
06:29:06,055 --> 06:29:07,290
OR FLORENCE, IT WAS PREDICTED

11683
06:29:07,290 --> 06:29:10,092
ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE SO PEOPLE

11684
06:29:10,092 --> 06:29:11,727
HAD TIME TO PREPARE.

11685
06:29:11,727 --> 06:29:12,829
THIS HURRICANE FORMED SO QUICKLY

11686
06:29:12,829 --> 06:29:14,464
THAT BY THE TIME PEOPLE WERE

11687
06:29:14,464 --> 06:29:15,565
GETTING THE MANDATORY EVACUATION

11688
06:29:15,565 --> 06:29:16,666
ORDERS THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THERE

11689
06:29:16,666 --> 06:29:17,367
WAS A STORM AT ALL.

11690
06:29:17,367 --> 06:29:18,601
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TIME FOR

11691
06:29:18,601 --> 06:29:20,737
THEM TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN, TO

11692
06:29:20,737 --> 06:29:21,170
BUY FOOD.

11693
06:29:21,170 --> 06:29:22,872
THAT'S THE THING THAT PEOPLE ARE

11694
06:29:22,872 --> 06:29:23,339
SAYING.

11695
06:29:23,339 --> 06:29:24,240
THEY ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW

11696
06:29:24,240 --> 06:29:26,876
INTENSE THIS STORM WAS BUT ALSO

11697
06:29:26,876 --> 06:29:29,145
HOW FAST IT WAS.

11698
06:29:29,145 --> 06:29:30,179
IT REALLY SURPRISED US TOO.

11699
06:29:30,179 --> 06:29:33,917
THIS STORM CAME IN WITH SUCH

11700
06:29:33,917 --> 06:29:35,150
INTENSITY BUT ALSO LEFT QUICKLY

11701
06:29:35,150 --> 06:29:36,653
>> I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STILL

11702
06:29:36,653 --> 06:29:38,488
TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE

11703
06:29:38,488 --> 06:29:40,222
SEVERITY OF THE DAMAGE THERE.

11704
06:29:40,222 --> 06:29:42,258
IS THERE ANY SENSE AT ALL FROM

11705
06:29:42,258 --> 06:29:42,992
FOLKS WHAT THEIR BIGGEST

11706
06:29:42,992 --> 06:29:49,032
CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE AS

11707
06:29:49,032 --> 06:29:50,600
THEY TRY TO RECOVER?

11708
06:29:50,600 --> 06:29:51,434
>> JUST LIKE EVERY STORM

11709
06:29:51,434 --> 06:29:52,836
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE IS SOMETHING

11710
06:29:52,836 --> 06:29:54,037
PEOPLE ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT

11711
06:29:54,037 --> 06:29:56,139
WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH YOUR

11712
06:29:56,139 --> 06:30:02,178
FOUNDATION OR VERY EXPENSIVE

11713
06:30:02,178 --> 06:30:04,881
REPAIRS.

11714
06:30:04,881 --> 06:30:07,217
DOWNED POWER LINES AND TREES ARE

11715
06:30:07,217 --> 06:30:07,784
ALSO A CONCERN FOR PEOPLE.

11716
06:30:07,784 --> 06:30:08,852
TAKES DAYS SOMETIMES TO GET ALL

11717
06:30:08,852 --> 06:30:18,127
OF THAT BACK UP AND RUNNING

11718
06:30:18,127 --> 06:30:18,327
AGAIN.

11719
06:30:18,327 --> 06:30:18,660
>> THANK YOU.

11720
06:30:18,660 --> 06:30:21,264
>>> HISHG MICHAEL MAY --

11721
06:30:21,264 --> 06:30:22,998
HURRICANE MICHAEL MAY BE ON ITS

11722
06:30:22,998 --> 06:30:25,668
WAY OUT BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

11723
06:30:25,668 --> 06:30:27,337
ARE STILL IN ITS PATH.

11724
06:30:27,337 --> 06:30:34,177
CRAIG WITH OUR MIAMI STATION IS

11725
06:30:34,177 --> 06:30:34,610
TRACKING THE STORM.

11726
06:30:34,610 --> 06:30:40,917
>> THE WIND FIELD IS STILL

11727
06:30:40,917 --> 06:30:41,250
RATHER LARGE.

11728
06:30:41,250 --> 06:30:48,024
NEAR THE CORE THE WINDS ARE VERY

11729
06:30:48,024 --> 06:30:48,257
STRONG.

11730
06:30:48,257 --> 06:30:49,459
DURING THE NIGHTTIME HOURS AND

11731
06:30:49,459 --> 06:30:51,794
THEN DURING THE DAY TOMORROW

11732
06:30:51,794 --> 06:30:52,595
MOVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE

11733
06:30:52,595 --> 06:30:52,862
CAROLINAS.

11734
06:30:52,862 --> 06:30:56,966
THEN OFF THE EAST COAST BY

11735
06:30:56,966 --> 06:30:57,733
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY

11736
06:30:57,733 --> 06:30:57,967
MORNING.

11737
06:30:57,967 --> 06:30:59,435
THE MAIN THING IS GOING TO BE

11738
06:30:59,435 --> 06:31:00,970
THOUGH IS GOING TO BE A

11739
06:31:00,970 --> 06:31:01,938
WIDESPREAD WIND FIELD THAT WILL

11740
06:31:01,938 --> 06:31:03,806
CONTINUE TO DO A LOT OF TREE

11741
06:31:03,806 --> 06:31:07,043
DAMAGE AND SO POWER OUTAGES ARE

11742
06:31:07,043 --> 06:31:09,479
TO BE EXPECTED FROM GEORGIA

11743
06:31:09,479 --> 06:31:10,113
THROUGH THE CAROLINAS.

11744
06:31:10,113 --> 06:31:12,181
MAYBE EVEN SOUTHEAST PARTS OF

11745
06:31:12,181 --> 06:31:13,750
VIRGINIA AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF

11746
06:31:13,750 --> 06:31:14,183
DELAWARE.

11747
06:31:14,183 --> 06:31:15,317
THE WINDS ARE GOING TO GRADUALLY

11748
06:31:15,317 --> 06:31:17,020
COME DOWN THE MOST INTENSE WINDS

11749
06:31:17,020 --> 06:31:19,555
BUT AS THE STORM MOVE ALONG THE

11750
06:31:19,555 --> 06:31:21,224
WIND FIELD SPREADS OUT A BIT

11751
06:31:21,224 --> 06:31:23,259
CAUSE THE STORM IS WEAKENING.

11752
06:31:23,259 --> 06:31:24,427
IN TERMS OF RAINFALL, ANOTHER

11753
06:31:24,427 --> 06:31:26,029
GOOD THING I SHOULD SAY THAT

11754
06:31:26,029 --> 06:31:30,166
THIS FAST MOVE -- MOVEMENT IS WE

11755
06:31:30,166 --> 06:31:30,867
ARE

11756
06:31:30,867 --> 06:31:38,174
NOT GOING TO SEE EXCESSIVE

11757
06:31:38,174 --> 06:31:39,275
AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL.

11758
06:31:39,275 --> 06:31:40,677
THERE IS ALSO THAT POSSIBILITY

11759
06:31:40,677 --> 06:31:41,878
OF TORNADOS ALONG AND TO THE

11760
06:31:41,878 --> 06:31:43,680
RIGHT OF THE TRACK.

11761
06:31:43,680 --> 06:31:46,449
IT COULD TO SOME LOCALIZED MORE

11762
06:31:46,449 --> 06:31:47,216
EXTREME AREAS OF DAMAGE.

11763
06:31:47,216 --> 06:31:48,918
THE GOOD NEWS ALSO IS WITH THIS

11764
06:31:48,918 --> 06:31:50,820
FAST MOVEMENT THE WEATHER WILL

11765
06:31:50,820 --> 06:31:52,789
BE IMPROVING FOR RESCUE AND

11766
06:31:52,789 --> 06:31:53,923
RECOVERY CREWS AS THE SYSTEM

11767
06:31:53,923 --> 06:31:56,192
ZIPS ON OUT OFF THE EAST COAST

11768
06:31:56,192 --> 06:31:56,759
BY FRIDAY.

11769
06:31:56,759 --> 06:31:58,995
>> THAT IS SOME GOOD NEWS.

11770
06:31:58,995 --> 06:31:59,295
THANK YOU.

11771
06:31:59,295 --> 06:32:02,065
>>> WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO

11772
06:32:02,065 --> 06:32:07,970
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE

11773
06:32:07,970 --> 06:32:08,237
AFFILIATE.

11774
06:32:08,237 --> 06:32:09,472
>> HE HEARD ALONG THOMASVILLE

11775
06:32:09,472 --> 06:32:10,806
ROAD THE STRETCH BY I-10 WHICH

11776
06:32:10,806 --> 06:32:13,776
IS RIGHT NEAR OUR STATION HAS

11777
06:32:13,776 --> 06:32:15,611
ABOUT A DOZEN POWER LINES JUST

11778
06:32:15,611 --> 06:32:17,947
THROWN, BROKEN THROUGHOUT THE

11779
06:32:17,947 --> 06:32:18,781
ROAD ON THOMASVILLE ROAD.

11780
06:32:18,781 --> 06:32:21,851
THAT IS ONE AREA THEY KNOW IS

11781
06:32:21,851 --> 06:32:22,718
PRETTY BAD OUT THERE.

11782
06:32:22,718 --> 06:32:26,956
AGAIN, ITS REALLY GOING TO BE

11783
06:32:26,956 --> 06:32:27,757
LOOKING OVER THE DAMAGE.

11784
06:32:27,757 --> 06:32:31,861
HERE'S A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD

11785
06:32:31,861 --> 06:32:32,729
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

11786
06:32:32,729 --> 06:32:34,197
>> THIS CREATED WIDESPREAD

11787
06:32:34,197 --> 06:32:34,530
DAMAGE.

11788
06:32:34,530 --> 06:32:35,465
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

11789
06:32:35,465 --> 06:32:36,799
WE HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE AS WE

11790
06:32:36,799 --> 06:32:39,636
SPEAK TO KNOW THAT THERE IS

11791
06:32:39,636 --> 06:32:40,836
WIDESPREAD DAMAGE ON OUR SYSTEM.

11792
06:32:40,836 --> 06:32:44,340
TO COMPARE IT TO HERMINE I THINK

11793
06:32:44,340 --> 06:32:45,775
IS A LITTLE EARLY.

11794
06:32:45,775 --> 06:32:47,110
WE HAVE MANY TREES DOWN.

11795
06:32:47,110 --> 06:32:48,244
WE HAVE BROKEN POLES IN OUR

11796
06:32:48,244 --> 06:32:48,811
SYSTEM.

11797
06:32:48,811 --> 06:32:53,950
WE KNOW WE HAVE DAMAGE TO OUR

11798
06:32:53,950 --> 06:32:54,784
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM.

11799
06:32:54,784 --> 06:32:56,119
>> SO AGAIN THE -- BULK OF THE

11800
06:32:56,119 --> 06:32:57,553
ACTION AS FAR AS ASSESSING THE

11801
06:32:57,553 --> 06:32:59,389
SYSTEM AND REALLY STARTING TO

11802
06:32:59,389 --> 06:33:01,424
BRING EVERYTHING BACK ONLINE

11803
06:33:01,424 --> 06:33:03,326
WILL START TOMORROW MORNING ONCE

11804
06:33:03,326 --> 06:33:03,960
DAYBREAK HITS.

11805
06:33:03,960 --> 06:33:06,629
THE CITY REALLY ASKING EVERY

11806
06:33:06,629 --> 06:33:07,597
BODY REPORT THEIR OUTAGES.

11807
06:33:07,597 --> 06:33:09,032
I KNOW LAST TIME I TALKED TO YOU

11808
06:33:09,032 --> 06:33:11,034
GUYS WE MENTIONED A LOT OF

11809
06:33:11,034 --> 06:33:13,202
PEOPLE TWEETING IN PICTURES OR

11810
06:33:13,202 --> 06:33:15,104
MESSAGING ON FACEBOOK TO THE

11811
06:33:15,104 --> 06:33:15,304
CITY.

11812
06:33:15,304 --> 06:33:16,673
THEY CAN SEE THOSE AND ADD THEM

11813
06:33:16,673 --> 06:33:22,712
BUT IT IS KIND OF AN EXTRA STEP

11814
06:33:22,712 --> 06:33:23,079
THERE.

11815
06:33:23,079 --> 06:33:27,917
IT TAKES A LITTLE LONG YOUR

11816
06:33:27,917 --> 06:33:30,052
REQUEST TO GET PUT IN.

11817
06:33:30,052 --> 06:33:31,120
IT WILL GO RIGHT THROUGH AND

11818
06:33:31,120 --> 06:33:33,156
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE CREWS TO

11819
06:33:33,156 --> 06:33:34,290
FIND WHERE THOSE OUTAGES ARE AND

11820
06:33:34,290 --> 06:33:36,826
AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET TO THOSE

11821
06:33:36,826 --> 06:33:37,293
OUTAGES.

11822
06:33:37,293 --> 06:33:39,896
THAT IS THE LATEST HERE FROM THE

11823
06:33:39,896 --> 06:33:40,563
EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER.

11824
06:33:40,563 --> 06:33:43,900
I WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU GUYS

11825
06:33:43,900 --> 06:33:44,333
IN STUDIO.

11826
06:33:44,333 --> 06:33:44,667
>> THANK YOU.

11827
06:33:44,667 --> 06:33:47,203
AND IT MAKES ME THINK -- THEY

11828
06:33:47,203 --> 06:33:49,439
ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

11829
06:33:49,439 --> 06:33:50,472
ASSESS TILL THE MORNING.

11830
06:33:50,472 --> 06:33:52,775
WHEN THE POWER IS OUT, IT GETS

11831
06:33:52,775 --> 06:33:53,776
REAL DARK OUT THERE.

11832
06:33:53,776 --> 06:33:56,712
>> IT DOES GET REAL DARK.

11833
06:33:56,712 --> 06:34:01,150
WE SAW THOSE TOWER CAM IMAGES OF

11834
06:34:01,150 --> 06:34:06,989
THE CITY OF TALLAHASSEE

11835
06:34:06,989 --> 06:34:07,656
BASICALLY BLANKETED IN DARKNESS.

11836
06:34:07,656 --> 06:34:12,261
>> IT JUST -- WE JUST TAKE ALL

11837
06:34:12,261 --> 06:34:13,963
THAT STUFF FOR GRANTED AND EVEN

11838
06:34:13,963 --> 06:34:17,100
DRIVING DOWN STREET AND THE LIT

11839
06:34:17,100 --> 06:34:19,635
UP BILLBOARDS AND THE -- THE LIT

11840
06:34:19,635 --> 06:34:21,370
UP BUSINESSES AND THE LIT UP

11841
06:34:21,370 --> 06:34:23,172
HOUSES AND -- IT GETS REALLY

11842
06:34:23,172 --> 06:34:24,873
DARK AND HARD TO NAVIGATE.

11843
06:34:24,873 --> 06:34:25,274
>> LOOK AT THIS.

11844
06:34:25,274 --> 06:34:28,644
THE VIEW WE SHOWED BEFORE WAS

11845
06:34:28,644 --> 06:34:34,049
THE VIEW FROM THE WCTV STUDIOS.

11846
06:34:34,049 --> 06:34:34,817
THIS IS THE VIEW LOOKING

11847
06:34:34,817 --> 06:34:35,752
DOWNTOWN.

11848
06:34:35,752 --> 06:34:36,386
YOU SEE WHATEVER THAT BUILDING

11849
06:34:36,386 --> 06:34:38,153
IS IN THE DISTANCE --

11850
06:34:38,153 --> 06:34:39,421
>> IS THAT THE STATE CAPITOL?

11851
06:34:39,421 --> 06:34:43,793
>> I DON'T KNOW.

11852
06:34:43,793 --> 06:34:47,529
THAT IS THE CAPITOL IS?

11853
06:34:47,529 --> 06:34:47,830
OKAY.

11854
06:34:47,830 --> 06:34:48,865
TOTAL DARKNESS ACROSS THIS CITY

06:34:48,865 --> 06:34:49,432

11856
06:34:49,432 --> 06:34:51,834
A FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE.

11857
06:34:51,834 --> 06:34:58,074
YOU SEE HEAD LIGHTS SPORADICALLY

11858
06:34:58,074 --> 06:35:00,910

MORE WEST ALONG I-10.

11866
06:35:18,060 --> 06:35:19,929
NORMALLY THERE ARE LIGHTS ALONG

11867
06:35:19,929 --> 06:35:22,097
THAT WHOLE STRETCH OF I-10 THERE

11868

06:35:44,120 --> 06:35:44,987
>> I THINK SHE ESTIMATED 70,000

11876
06:35:44,987 --> 06:35:47,590

I WILL GET ON MY LITTLE SOAPBOX

06:36:17,286 --> 06:36:18,821
TOO THAT -- THERE IS NOT A LOT

11894
06:36:18,821 --> 06:36:20,189
OF TRAFFIC OUT THERE BUT DON'T

11895
06:36:20,189 --> 06:36:21,324
FORGET EVEN THOUGH TRAFFIC LIGHT

11896
06:36:21,324 --> 06:36:23,392
IS OUT, YOU GOT TO TREAT IT AS

11897
06:36:23,392 --> 06:36:24,427
FOUR WAY STOP.

11898
06:36:24,427 --> 06:36:25,494
THE GUY COMING FROM THE SIDE

11899
06:36:25,494 --> 06:36:26,829
DIRECTION MIGHT THINK THE SAME

11900
06:36:26,829 --> 06:36:28,664
THING THAT HE CAN GO BLOWING

11901
06:36:28,664 --> 06:36:29,097
THROUGH IT.

11902
06:36:29,097 --> 06:36:31,267
IF YOU COME UP TO A TRAFFIC

11903
06:36:31,267 --> 06:36:32,768
LIGHT AND IF YOU SEE --

11904
06:36:32,768 --> 06:36:35,003
>> WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING

11905
06:36:35,003 --> 06:36:36,439
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE

11906
06:36:36,439 --> 06:36:37,106
AFFILIATE ON HURRICANE MICHAEL.

11907
06:36:37,106 --> 06:36:38,374
MUCH MORE ON THE STORM

11908
06:36:38,374 --> 06:36:39,674
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING.

11909
06:36:39,674 --> 06:36:42,111
RIGHT NOW A QUICK BREAK.

11910
06:36:42,111 --> 06:36:42,644
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.

11911
06:39:00,349 --> 06:39:00,649
HI EVERYONE.

11912
06:39:00,649 --> 06:39:01,283
AT LEAST ONE PERSON IS CONFIRMED

11913
06:39:01,283 --> 06:39:03,019
DEAD AFTER HURRICANE MICHAEL

11914
06:39:03,019 --> 06:39:05,254
SLAMMED THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE

11915
06:39:05,254 --> 06:39:05,821
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.

11916
06:39:05,821 --> 06:39:07,356
THE HISTORIC CATEGORY 4 STORM

11917
06:39:07,356 --> 06:39:09,992
MADE LANDFALL WITH TOP SUSTAINED

11918
06:39:09,992 --> 06:39:11,360
WINDS OF 155 MILES PER HOUR.

11919
06:39:11,360 --> 06:39:13,662
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION

11920
06:39:13,662 --> 06:39:16,532
CUSTOMERS IN FLORIDA ARE WITHOUT

11921
06:39:16,532 --> 06:39:16,866
POWER.

11922
06:39:16,866 --> 06:39:18,601
WE ARE SEEING PICTURES OF

11923
06:39:18,601 --> 06:39:20,002
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE AND

11924
06:39:20,002 --> 06:39:20,269
FLOODING.

11925
06:39:20,269 --> 06:39:22,204
SOME AREAS SAW 10 FEET OF STORM

11926
06:39:22,204 --> 06:39:22,571
SURGE.

11927
06:39:22,571 --> 06:39:24,140
THE HURRICANE HAS SLOWED A BIT

11928
06:39:24,140 --> 06:39:25,074
BUT IS STILL DELIVERING A HEAVY

11929
06:39:25,074 --> 06:39:29,979
WHETHER OR NOT E- --

11930
06:39:29,979 --> 06:39:30,179
BLOW.

11931
06:39:30,179 --> 06:39:33,382
JOINING ME NOW FOR THE LATEST IS

11932
06:39:33,382 --> 06:39:35,251
CBS NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER DAVID

11933
06:39:35,251 --> 06:39:35,518
PARKINSON.

11934
06:39:35,518 --> 06:39:36,318
WHAT IS THE VERY LATEST?

11935
06:39:36,318 --> 06:39:42,191
>> THE VERY LATEST IS WE JUST

11936
06:39:42,191 --> 06:39:48,664
GOT AN ADVISORY.

11937
06:39:48,664 --> 06:39:51,934
WE ARE DOWN NOW TO 90.

11938
06:39:51,934 --> 06:39:53,069
THE STORM IS SERIOUSLY WEAKENING

11939
06:39:53,069 --> 06:39:55,504
AND THAT IS A REALLY GOOD THING.

11940
06:39:55,504 --> 06:39:56,806
THAT BEING SAID, YOU STILL NEED

11941
06:39:56,806 --> 06:39:58,707
TO WATCH OUT FOR THE HEAVY RAIN.

11942
06:39:58,707 --> 06:40:00,209
YOU STILL NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR

11943
06:40:00,209 --> 06:40:02,744
THE STRONG WIND AND WIND GUSTS

11944
06:40:02,744 --> 06:40:04,112
THAT CAN BRING DOWN POWER LINES.

11945
06:40:04,112 --> 06:40:05,681
ALSO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU

11946
06:40:05,681 --> 06:40:07,883
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF STORM SURGE

11947
06:40:07,883 --> 06:40:11,654
THREAT RIGHT ALONG THE COAST OF

11948
06:40:11,654 --> 06:40:20,162
THE ATLANTIC BY CHARLESTON AND

11949
06:40:20,162 --> 06:40:20,429
SAVANNAH.

11950
06:40:20,429 --> 06:40:26,268
WHAT WAS SURPRISING WE -- IT

11951
06:40:26,268 --> 06:40:28,070
SHOULD BE STARTING TO FALL

11952
06:40:28,070 --> 06:40:28,303
APART.

11953
06:40:28,303 --> 06:40:29,204
YOU LOSING THAT TYPICAL SORT OF

11954
06:40:29,204 --> 06:40:31,573
DONUT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN THE

11955
06:40:31,573 --> 06:40:32,174
CENTER.

11956
06:40:32,174 --> 06:40:34,343
ITS AMAZING HOW QUICKLY IT SPUN

11957
06:40:34,343 --> 06:40:34,509
UP.

11958
06:40:34,509 --> 06:40:37,480
WE GAINED 55 MILES AN HOUR IN

11959
06:40:37,480 --> 06:40:37,880
ABOUT 30 HOURS.

11960
06:40:37,880 --> 06:40:39,915
THE REASON FOR THAT WAS BECAUSE

11961
06:40:39,915 --> 06:40:41,717
THERE WAS JUST NOTHING STOPPING

11962
06:40:41,717 --> 06:40:42,184
IT.

11963
06:40:42,184 --> 06:40:44,053
HAD WARM WATER, THE DRY AIR

11964
06:40:44,053 --> 06:40:46,288
DIDN'T MAKE IT IN WHERE AS NOW

11965
06:40:46,288 --> 06:40:47,656
ITS INTERACTING WITH LAND.

11966
06:40:47,656 --> 06:40:49,158
YOU HAVE THE FRICTION OF LAND

11967
06:40:49,158 --> 06:40:52,228
AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSES IT TO

11968
06:40:52,228 --> 06:40:52,461
WEAKEN.

11969
06:40:52,461 --> 06:40:53,495
THERE IS NO FUEL SOURCE.

11970
06:40:53,495 --> 06:40:55,931
THERE IS NO WATER AND THAT'S --

11971
06:40:55,931 --> 06:40:58,734
THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU

11972
06:40:58,734 --> 06:41:00,870
DON'T WANT A STORM WITH WINDS

11973
06:41:00,870 --> 06:41:02,972
ANY STRONGER THAN THEY HAVE TO

11974
06:41:02,972 --> 06:41:04,673
GOING THROUGH PLACES IN UP LAND

11975
06:41:04,673 --> 06:41:06,609
SOUTH CAROLINA AND NORTH

11976
06:41:06,609 --> 06:41:08,944
CAROLINA WHERE YOU HAVE

11977
06:41:08,944 --> 06:41:09,211
ELEVATION.

11978
06:41:09,211 --> 06:41:09,811
YOU COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE

11979
06:41:09,811 --> 06:41:10,478
MUDSLIDES, BRINGING THINGS DOWN

11980
06:41:10,478 --> 06:41:12,147
WHEN YOU HAVE WINDS OF THAT

11981
06:41:12,147 --> 06:41:12,781
SPEED AS WELL.

11982
06:41:12,781 --> 06:41:14,884
>> SO I MEAN THERE IS NO CHANCE

11983
06:41:14,884 --> 06:41:16,685
THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN AGAIN AT

11984
06:41:16,685 --> 06:41:16,985
THIS POINT.

11985
06:41:16,985 --> 06:41:18,787
>> IT CAN STRENGTHEN AGAIN ONCE

11986
06:41:18,787 --> 06:41:21,290
IT GETS BACK OVER WATER WHICH IS

11987
06:41:21,290 --> 06:41:22,658
GOING TO DO PROBABLY OVER THE

11988
06:41:22,658 --> 06:41:24,893
CHESAPEAKE AREA AND THAT WOULD

11989
06:41:24,893 --> 06:41:26,095
BE FRIDAY MORNING.

11990
06:41:26,095 --> 06:41:29,097
OVER LAND, NO.

11991
06:41:29,097 --> 06:41:30,266
IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

11992
06:41:30,266 --> 06:41:30,499
WEAKEN.

11993
06:41:30,499 --> 06:41:31,634
THEY EXPECT IT TO BE A TROPICAL

11994
06:41:31,634 --> 06:41:34,703
STORM BY THE TIME WE GET TO 2:00

11995
06:41:34,703 --> 06:41:35,504
A.M.

11996
06:41:35,504 --> 06:41:35,804
ON THURSDAY.

11997
06:41:35,804 --> 06:41:38,674
I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY BE DOWN

11998
06:41:38,674 --> 06:41:40,509
THERE BEFORE THAT POINT BUT ITS

11999
06:41:40,509 --> 06:41:42,911
MOVING SO QUICKLY IT WILL

12000
06:41:42,911 --> 06:41:44,113
MAINTAIN AT LEAST A DECENT

12001
06:41:44,113 --> 06:41:45,480
AMOUNT OF STRENGTH AS IT MOVES

12002
06:41:45,480 --> 06:41:46,048
INLAND FOR A WHILE.

12003
06:41:46,048 --> 06:41:48,184
>> WHAT ABOUT RAIN FOR PEOPLE IN

12004
06:41:48,184 --> 06:41:49,218
THE PATH OF THIS STORM STILL

12005
06:41:49,218 --> 06:41:50,786
WHAT DO THEY NEED TO BE ON THE

12006
06:41:50,786 --> 06:41:52,254
LOOK OUT FOR?

12007
06:41:52,254 --> 06:41:54,990
>> THE RAIN NUMBERS HAVE COME

12008
06:41:54,990 --> 06:41:56,525
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

12009
06:41:56,525 --> 06:41:57,927
THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR 4-8

12010
06:41:57,927 --> 06:41:59,595
INCHES WHERE YOU SEE THAT ORANGE

12011
06:41:59,595 --> 06:42:03,232
AREA THAT IS RIGHT ALONG THE

12012
06:42:03,232 --> 06:42:03,865
SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA BORDER.

12013
06:42:03,865 --> 06:42:04,699
IN ADDITION INTO NORTH CAROLINA,

12014
06:42:04,699 --> 06:42:06,468

MAYBE.

12020
06:42:16,579 --> 06:42:17,346
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

12021
06:42:17,346 --> 06:42:18,613

THAT'S THE NEXT BIG CONCERN

12028
06:42:27,823 --> 06:42:28,958
INCLUDING SOME RIVERS THAT SAW

12029
06:42:28,958 --> 06:42:31,694
SOME FLOODING THAT WAS QUITE --

12030
06:42:31,694 --> 06:42:32,594

06:48:14,202 --> 06:48:16,271
THE RAIN HAS REALLY STOPPED IN

12195
06:48:16,271 --> 06:48:16,605
THIS AREA.

12196
06:48:16,605 --> 06:48:17,906
SOME OF THE FLOODING, SOME OF

12197
06:48:17,906 --> 06:48:20,108
THE STORM SURGE WE SAW EARLIER

12198
06:48:20,108 --> 06:48:21,810
IS STARTING TO RECEDE A LITTLE

12199
06:48:21,810 --> 06:48:22,144
BIT.

12200
06:48:22,144 --> 06:48:24,479
THE BIG ISSUE IS GOING TO BE OF

12201
06:48:24,479 --> 06:48:24,946
COURSE CLEAN UP.

12202
06:48:24,946 --> 06:48:29,651
THAT WILL BE A LONG TERM THING.

12203
06:48:29,651 --> 06:48:30,318
WE HAVE TREES DOWN.

12204
06:48:30,318 --> 06:48:35,957
WE HAVE SEEN PIECES OFFENSE --

12205
06:48:35,957 --> 06:48:37,359
OF

12206
06:48:37,359 --> 06:48:38,593
FENCE THAT ARE STREWN ABOUT THIS

12207
06:48:38,593 --> 06:48:38,927
NEIGHBORHOOD.

12208
06:48:38,927 --> 06:48:40,662
THAT WILL BE PART OF THE LONG

12209
06:48:40,662 --> 06:48:41,830
TERM PROCESS ABOUT THE CLEAN UP.

12210
06:48:41,830 --> 06:48:44,466
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO SHOW

12211
06:48:44,466 --> 06:48:47,002
YOU OVER HERE, THE PANHANDLE HAS

12212
06:48:47,002 --> 06:48:49,338
A LOT OF THESE BEAUTIFUL PINE

12213
06:48:49,338 --> 06:48:49,638
TREES.

12214
06:48:49,638 --> 06:48:51,472
THEY ARE TALL AND STRAIGHT.

12215
06:48:51,472 --> 06:48:52,474
GREAT DURING THE SUMMER.

12216
06:48:52,474 --> 06:48:53,976
WHEN ITS HURRICANE TIME, THEY

12217
06:48:53,976 --> 06:48:56,345
WILL SNAP IN HALF AND BRING DOWN

12218
06:48:56,345 --> 06:48:58,714
ALL THE POWER LINES.

12219
06:48:58,714 --> 06:49:03,251
THAT ONE IS PROBABLY MAYBE 50,

12220
06:49:03,251 --> 06:49:04,820
60 FEET BUT ITS SNAPPED RIGHT IN

12221
06:49:04,820 --> 06:49:05,220
THE CENTER.

12222
06:49:05,220 --> 06:49:06,588
A LOT OF THOSE ARE BLOCKING THE

12223
06:49:06,588 --> 06:49:06,788
ROADS.

12224
06:49:06,788 --> 06:49:09,424
THAT WILL BE A MAJOR PART OF THE

12225
06:49:09,424 --> 06:49:10,092
CLEAN UP HERE.

12226
06:49:10,092 --> 06:49:15,931
>> TELL US, WE SAW IN YOUR PIECE

12227
06:49:15,931 --> 06:49:17,132
PRIVATE CITIZENS, WHAT ABOUT

12228
06:49:17,132 --> 06:49:25,073
FIRST RESTER PONDERS --

12229
06:49:25,073 --> 06:49:26,174
RESPONDERS?

12230
06:49:26,174 --> 06:49:29,444
>> WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM

12231
06:49:29,444 --> 06:49:30,011
TRICKLE OUT.

12232
06:49:30,011 --> 06:49:32,080
THEY TOLD US THAT THE HOSPITALS

12233
06:49:32,080 --> 06:49:32,380
ARE CLOSED.

12234
06:49:32,380 --> 06:49:34,116
ALL THE AMBULANCES ARE FARTHER

12235
06:49:34,116 --> 06:49:34,416
INLAND.

12236
06:49:34,416 --> 06:49:35,016
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL HELP IT

12237
06:49:35,016 --> 06:49:37,919
ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN TILL AFTER

12238
06:49:37,919 --> 06:49:38,252
THE STORM.

12239
06:49:38,252 --> 06:49:40,121
WE DID SEE SOME POLICE.

12240
06:49:40,121 --> 06:49:42,524
THEY HAD ONE OF THESE REAL HIGH

12241
06:49:42,524 --> 06:49:44,626
VEHICLES.

12242
06:49:44,626 --> 06:49:45,693
THEY WENT INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

12243
06:49:45,693 --> 06:49:46,628
THAT IS BEHIND ME HERE.

12244
06:49:46,628 --> 06:49:48,330
SOME OF THESE HOMES WERE UNDER 4

12245
06:49:48,330 --> 06:49:49,197
FEET OF WATER.

12246
06:49:49,197 --> 06:49:51,233
WE WERE SEEING THEM DRIVE TO

12247
06:49:51,233 --> 06:49:51,866
THOSE AREAS.

12248
06:49:51,866 --> 06:49:56,872
WE SAW THEM PULL OUT AN ELDERLY

12249
06:49:56,872 --> 06:49:58,173
COUPLE.

12250
06:49:58,173 --> 06:49:59,875
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM.

12251
06:49:59,875 --> 06:50:01,043
THE BIG THING PEOPLE WANT TO

12252
06:50:01,043 --> 06:50:06,048
SEE, THEY WANT TO SEE THE POWER

12253
06:50:06,048 --> 06:50:08,516
E CREWS AND THOSE CHERRY PICKERS

12254
06:50:08,516 --> 06:50:09,251
BECAUSE THAT MEANS PROGRESS

12255
06:50:09,251 --> 06:50:09,451
SOON.

12256
06:50:09,451 --> 06:50:12,287
>> AND IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO

12257
06:50:12,287 --> 06:50:15,891
TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THIS

12258
06:50:15,891 --> 06:50:17,526
STORM COMPARES TO OTHERS MIGHT

12259
06:50:17,526 --> 06:50:18,260
HAVE HIT THE AREA.

12260
06:50:18,260 --> 06:50:21,363
>> THERE IS SOME PEOPLE THAT

12261
06:50:21,363 --> 06:50:24,066
SAID THEY REALLY CAN'T COMPARE

12262
06:50:24,066 --> 06:50:24,399
IT.

12263
06:50:24,399 --> 06:50:24,932
THERE WAS HERMINE IN 2016.

12264
06:50:24,932 --> 06:50:27,869
THERE WAS WIND THAT WAS A RAIN

12265
06:50:27,869 --> 06:50:28,370
EVENT.

12266
06:50:28,370 --> 06:50:30,072
TO HAVE A CATEGORY 4 JUST

12267
06:50:30,072 --> 06:50:31,273
BARRELLING TOWARDS THE

12268
06:50:31,273 --> 06:50:33,108
PENINSULA, IT HAS BEEN DECADES

12269
06:50:33,108 --> 06:50:33,942
SINCE ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAS

12270
06:50:33,942 --> 06:50:36,411
EVER BEEN THOUGHT OF IN THAT

12271
06:50:36,411 --> 06:50:38,246
AREA.

12272
06:50:38,246 --> 06:50:41,082
FOR SOME REASON IT ALWAYS TURNS

12273
06:50:41,082 --> 06:50:41,483
OFF.

12274
06:50:41,483 --> 06:50:44,286
FOR HERE IN THIS AREA, PEOPLE

12275
06:50:44,286 --> 06:50:45,053
WERE LISTENING.

12276
06:50:45,053 --> 06:50:48,656
A LOT OF PEOPLE EVACUATED.

12277
06:50:48,656 --> 06:50:49,157
THY WENT FARTHER INLAND.

12278
06:50:49,157 --> 06:50:51,960
IN PORT SAINT JO THERE IS ABOUT

12279
06:50:51,960 --> 06:50:54,830
3500 PEOPLE AND THE SHERIFF

12280
06:50:54,830 --> 06:50:56,698
DEPARTMENT WAS TELLING US ABOUT

12281
06:50:56,698 --> 06:50:57,332
60% STAYED.

12282
06:50:57,332 --> 06:51:00,268
THEY STAYED IN THE AREA AND

12283
06:51:00,268 --> 06:51:01,002
DECIDED TO RIDE IT OUT.

12284
06:51:01,002 --> 06:51:02,604
WE ARE TRYING TO SEE IF THOSE

12285
06:51:02,604 --> 06:51:04,105
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME BACK.

12286
06:51:04,105 --> 06:51:05,841
THEY ARE COMING TO CHECK ON

12287
06:51:05,841 --> 06:51:06,775
THEIR PROPERTY, ON THEIR

12288
06:51:06,775 --> 06:51:09,077
BUSINESSES AND THEY ARE HAVING

12289
06:51:09,077 --> 06:51:12,347
TO DO THAT FIRST ASSESSMENT

12290
06:51:12,347 --> 06:51:13,215
WHICH SOMETIMES CAN BE SHOCKING.

12291
06:51:13,215 --> 06:51:14,416
>> YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE ON THE

12292
06:51:14,416 --> 06:51:16,151
LOOK OUT FOR THOSE POWER CREWS.

12293
06:51:16,151 --> 06:51:18,052
WHAT TO YOU THINK SOME OF THE

12294
06:51:18,052 --> 06:51:19,621
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE FOR

12295
06:51:19,621 --> 06:51:23,158
PEOPLE AS THEY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO

12296
06:51:23,158 --> 06:51:23,458
RECOVER?

12297
06:51:23,458 --> 06:51:26,795
YOU DON'T HAVE POWER, YOU DON'T

12298
06:51:26,795 --> 06:51:28,029
HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.

12299
06:51:28,029 --> 06:51:29,464
IMAGINE ITS PRETTY WARM.

12300
06:51:29,464 --> 06:51:30,097
>> IT IS.

12301
06:51:30,097 --> 06:51:33,068
THERE IS SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE

12302
06:51:33,068 --> 06:51:39,474
GOOD PREPPERS AND THEY HAVE

12303
06:51:39,474 --> 06:51:40,541
GENERATORS READY TO GO.

12304
06:51:40,541 --> 06:51:41,576
THEY WERE MAYBE CHARGING THEIR

12305
06:51:41,576 --> 06:51:43,644
PHONES AND WHAT NOT IN CARS.

12306
06:51:43,644 --> 06:51:45,313
THERE IS NO CELL SIGNAL RIGHT

12307
06:51:45,313 --> 06:51:45,680
NOW HERE.

12308
06:51:45,680 --> 06:51:46,948
PRETTY MUCH DEAD IN THE AREA.

12309
06:51:46,948 --> 06:51:48,383
THE BIG CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE

12310
06:51:48,383 --> 06:51:49,918
FOR THE POWER CREWS THEY WILL

12311
06:51:49,918 --> 06:51:52,888
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN

12312
06:51:52,888 --> 06:51:53,121
ROADS.

12313
06:51:53,121 --> 06:51:54,656
WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE CHAIN

12314
06:51:54,656 --> 06:51:56,124
SAW CREWS COME OUT FIRST, START

12315
06:51:56,124 --> 06:52:02,130
CLEARING SOME OF THE ROADS.

12316
06:52:02,130 --> 06:52:08,537
VOLUNTEERS HAVE STARTED DOING IT

12317
06:52:08,537 --> 06:52:08,770
AS WELL.

12318
06:52:08,770 --> 06:52:10,672
HOPEFULLY THEY KNOW -- IT WILL

12319
06:52:10,672 --> 06:52:11,273
BE SEVERAL DAYS.

12320
06:52:11,273 --> 06:52:14,543
THEY ARE HOPING ITS NOT SEVERAL

12321
06:52:14,543 --> 06:52:17,512
WEEKS BEFORE THEY GET POWER.

12322
06:52:17,512 --> 06:52:18,046
>> THANK YOU.

12323
06:52:18,046 --> 06:52:20,148
COMING UP, WE WILL HAVE MORE ON

12324
06:52:20,148 --> 06:52:22,651
THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SEEKING

12325
06:52:22,651 --> 06:52:23,250
SHELTER DUE TO HURRICANE

12326
06:52:23,250 --> 06:52:23,517
MICHAEL.

12327
06:52:23,517 --> 06:52:25,787
THE MOST POWERFUL STORM TO HIT

12328
06:52:25,787 --> 06:52:27,956
THE U.S. MAINLAND IN NEARLY 50

12329
06:52:27,956 --> 06:52:28,290
YEARS.

12330
06:52:28,290 --> 06:52:30,258
>>> PLUS LAWMAKERS ARE CALLING

12331
06:52:30,258 --> 06:52:31,459
FOR ANSWERS ABOUT A SAUDI

12332
06:52:31,459 --> 06:52:33,662
JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN MISSING

06:52:33,662 --> 06:52:34,195
FOR MORE THAN WEEK.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE'S

12335
06:52:37,032 --> 06:52:39,834
LOOKING INTO WHAT HAPPENED.

12336
06:52:39,834 --> 06:52:40,334
THIS IS CBSN.

CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON.

THE DOW JONES

12339

PLUNGED MORE THAN 800 POINTS

12340
06:55:03,411 --> 06:55:04,045
WEDNESDAY.

12341
06:55:04,045 --> 06:55:09,750
ITS WORST DROP IN EIGHT MONTHS.

12342
06:55:09,750 --> 06:55:17,659
WHILE THE S&P 500 SANK.

12343

MARTIN IS LONDON

12344
06:55:18,426 --> 06:55:20,261
BUREAU CHIEF AND HE JOINS ME

12345
06:55:20,261 --> 06:55:21,096
NOW.

12346
06:55:21,096 --> 06:55:21,963
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.

12347
06:55:21,963 --> 06:55:24,332
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE SUCH A

12348
06:55:24,332 --> 06:55:25,099
LARGE DROP TODAY?

12349
06:55:25,099 --> 06:55:25,567
>> I REALLY WAS.

12350
06:55:25,567 --> 06:55:27,801
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE START OF

12351
06:55:27,801 --> 06:55:33,074
THE TRADING KAND OF -- KIND OF

12352
06:55:33,074 --> 06:55:34,075
IN

12353
06:55:34,075 --> 06:55:37,378
AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY.

12354
06:55:37,378 --> 06:55:38,646
WE SAW THE SHARP DECLINES.

12355
06:55:38,646 --> 06:55:40,281
YOU MENTION -- THE NASDAQ HAD

12356
06:55:40,281 --> 06:55:42,984
ITS WORST DAY THIS SEVEN YEARS

12357
06:55:42,984 --> 06:55:44,352
TO DAY.

12358
06:55:44,352 --> 06:55:45,053
>> SO WHY IS THAT?

12359
06:55:45,053 --> 06:55:46,821
WHY DOES SOME TECH STOCKS SUFFER

12360
06:55:46,821 --> 06:55:48,256
SUCH BIG HITS?

12361
06:55:48,323 --> 06:55:57,265
>> THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO

12362
06:55:57,265 --> 06:55:57,732
RISING INTEREST RATES.

12363
06:55:57,732 --> 06:55:58,332
INVESTORS WILL TAKE SOME OF

12364
06:55:58,332 --> 06:56:00,468
THE MONEY OUT OF THE MARKET AS A

12365
06:56:00,468 --> 06:56:00,735
RESULT.

12366
06:56:00,735 --> 06:56:01,836
PUT IT INTO CONTEXT AS WELL AND

12367
06:56:01,836 --> 06:56:03,805
THAT TECH HAS LED THE GAINS FOR

12368
06:56:03,805 --> 06:56:04,271
MOST OF THE YEAR.

12369
06:56:04,271 --> 06:56:06,074
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT

12370
06:56:06,074 --> 06:56:07,842
TAKING AS WE HEAD TO THE FINAL

12371
06:56:07,842 --> 06:56:08,143
MONTHS.

12372
06:56:08,143 --> 06:56:09,643
IF YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING ON A

12373
06:56:09,643 --> 06:56:11,546
25% GAIN, YOU DON'T MIND LOSING

12374

2 OR 3% TODAY AND MAYBE JUST SIT

12375
06:56:15,383 --> 06:56:16,451
IT OUT TILL CHRISTMAS.

12376
06:56:16,451 --> 06:56:18,752
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER

12377
06:56:18,752 --> 06:56:19,087
FACTORS?

12378
06:56:19,087 --> 06:56:20,254
>> THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IT TO

12379
06:56:20,254 --> 06:56:23,157
DAY WHEN WE WAS CRITICAL OF THE

12380
06:56:23,157 --> 06:56:23,558
FEDERAL RESERVE.

12381
06:56:23,558 --> 06:56:25,060
HE THINKS THEY ARE MOVING A

12382
06:56:25,060 --> 06:56:25,493
LITTLE TOO FAST.

12383
06:56:25,493 --> 06:56:27,595
THERE ARE SOME WHO AGREE AND

12384
06:56:27,595 --> 06:56:29,331
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DON'T.

12385
06:56:29,331 --> 06:56:32,566
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS RUNNING AT

12386
06:56:32,566 --> 06:56:38,106
THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN

12387
06:56:38,106 --> 06:56:38,706
FIVE YEARS.

12388
06:56:38,706 --> 06:56:39,074
UB.

12389
06:56:39,074 --> 06:56:41,509
WE ARE LEANING A LITTLE EVERY

12390
06:56:41,509 --> 06:56:42,043
WEEK.

12391
06:56:42,043 --> 06:56:42,576
INFLATION IS PRETTY TAME.

12392
06:56:42,576 --> 06:56:44,578
THE FED IS MOVING MORE QUICKLY

12393
06:56:44,578 --> 06:56:50,652
FOR SOME AND MAYBE NOT AS QUICK

12394
06:56:50,652 --> 06:56:51,185
FOR OTHERS.

12395
06:56:51,185 --> 06:56:52,987
>> WELL LET ME ASK YOU, THIS DOW

12396
06:56:52,987 --> 06:56:55,256
IS STILL AT A RECORD LEVEL.

12397
06:56:55,256 --> 06:56:58,093
OVERALL, IS THIS JUST A BLIP?

12398
06:56:58,093 --> 06:56:59,394
IS THIS A MOMENTARY BLIP ON THE

12399
06:56:59,394 --> 06:56:59,894
RADAR SCREEN?

12400
06:56:59,894 --> 06:57:01,162
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL

12401
06:57:01,162 --> 06:57:02,563
ECONOMIC HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY,

12402
06:57:02,563 --> 06:57:03,998
HOW DOES THAT PICTURE LOOK?

12403
06:57:03,998 --> 06:57:05,533
>> I THINK ITS STILL DOING

12404
06:57:05,533 --> 06:57:06,034
TERRIBLY WELL.

12405
06:57:06,034 --> 06:57:12,340
ONE OF THE BEST PACES IN FIVE

12406
06:57:12,340 --> 06:57:14,843
YEARS.

12407
06:57:14,843 --> 06:57:15,577
THAT'S REALLY HEALTHY

12408
06:57:15,577 --> 06:57:16,311
EARNINGS AND REALLY DOES

12409
06:57:16,311 --> 06:57:18,179
ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE THINGS

12410
06:57:18,179 --> 06:57:19,213
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.

12411
06:57:19,213 --> 06:57:20,614
NOW WHAT INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED

12412
06:57:20,614 --> 06:57:22,450
ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN 2019

12413
06:57:22,450 --> 06:57:28,156
WHEN THE IMPACT OF TAX CUTS

12414
06:57:28,156 --> 06:57:28,656
STARTS TO FADE AWAY.

12415
06:57:28,656 --> 06:57:29,691
PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT

12416
06:57:29,691 --> 06:57:31,826
IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ON

12417
06:57:31,826 --> 06:57:32,860
GOING TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN

12418
06:57:32,860 --> 06:57:34,028
WASHINGTON AND BEIJING AND THE

12419
06:57:34,028 --> 06:57:36,430
TARIFFS THAT ARE PILING UP?

12420
06:57:36,430 --> 06:57:39,834
AT THE MOMENT THEY SIT AT $250

12421
06:57:39,834 --> 06:57:42,103
BILLION.

12422
06:57:42,103 --> 06:57:45,540
THEY COULD RISE TO $500 BILLION

12423
06:57:45,540 --> 06:57:47,876
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

12424
06:57:47,876 --> 06:57:48,909
THAT COULD HAVE A REALLY

12425
06:57:48,909 --> 06:57:49,944
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CONSUMER

12426
06:57:49,944 --> 06:57:51,980
SPENDING AND THEN HAVE A

12427
06:57:51,980 --> 06:57:53,381
CASCADING EFFECT INTO STOCKS AND

12428
06:57:53,381 --> 06:57:53,748
EVERYTHING ELSE.

12429
06:57:53,748 --> 06:57:56,985
WE MAY NOT KNOW THE TRUE STORY

12430
06:57:56,985 --> 06:57:58,519
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW.

12431
06:57:58,519 --> 06:58:00,054
>> HOW QUICKLY CAN CAN MARKET

12432
06:58:00,054 --> 06:58:01,556
REBOUND FROM WHAT WE HAVE JUST

12433
06:58:01,556 --> 06:58:02,190
SEEN?

12434
06:58:02,190 --> 06:58:03,892
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD

12435
06:58:03,892 --> 06:58:04,559
EXPECT RELATIVELY QUICKLY WILL

12436
06:58:04,559 --> 06:58:04,926
CORRECT ITSELF?

12437
06:58:04,926 --> 06:58:05,626
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

12438
06:58:05,626 --> 06:58:10,064
I THINK WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE

12439
06:58:10,064 --> 06:58:14,135
FASCINATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS

12440
06:58:14,135 --> 06:58:15,370
OVERNIGHT IN THE ASIAN MARKETS.

12441
06:58:15,370 --> 06:58:17,205
IF IT FOLLOWS SUIT WE COULD SEE

12442
06:58:17,205 --> 06:58:19,140
MORE SELLING FRIDAY -- THURSDAY

12443
06:58:19,140 --> 06:58:20,175
AND THEN POTENTIALLY INTO

12444
06:58:20,175 --> 06:58:20,408
FRIDAY.

12445
06:58:20,408 --> 06:58:22,644
WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN

12446
06:58:22,644 --> 06:58:23,711
IS WITH THE BANK EARNINGS

12447
06:58:23,711 --> 06:58:25,546
BEGINNING ON FRIDAY AND THEN THE

12448
06:58:25,546 --> 06:58:26,113
LARGER CORPORATE EARNINGS

12449
06:58:26,113 --> 06:58:27,448
STARTING NEXT WEEK WE WILL START

12450
06:58:27,448 --> 06:58:33,354
TO SEE SOME OF THOSE GOOD

12451
06:58:33,354 --> 06:58:34,055
NUMBERS.

12452
06:58:34,055 --> 06:58:34,889
THEN WE COULD POTENTIALLY STEADY

12453
06:58:34,889 --> 06:58:35,156
THE SHIP.

12454
06:58:35,156 --> 06:58:36,591
I STILL THINK THE MARKET IS GOOD

12455
06:58:36,591 --> 06:58:41,396
TILL THE END OF THE YEAR.

12456
06:58:41,396 --> 06:58:46,734
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL HEALTHY

12457
06:58:46,734 --> 06:58:48,670
CORRECTION.

12458
06:58:48,670 --> 06:58:49,304
--

12459
06:58:49,304 --> 06:58:50,771
>> SO IF YOU ARE AN INVESTOR

12460
06:58:50,771 --> 06:58:53,308
RIGHT NOW AND YOU ARE FEELING A

12461
06:58:53,308 --> 06:58:54,542
LITTLE NERVOUS, WHAT ARE YOU

12462
06:58:54,542 --> 06:58:54,809
THINKING?

12463
06:58:54,809 --> 06:58:55,543
>> I'D SAY DON'T WORRY.

12464
06:58:55,543 --> 06:58:57,445
IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN THE

12465
06:58:57,445 --> 06:58:58,212
MARKET, AND THE FUNDMENTALS OF

12466
06:58:58,212 --> 06:58:59,714
THE COMPANIES YOU OWN, YOU HAVE

12467
06:58:59,714 --> 06:59:00,782
A CHANCE TO BUY THEM MORE

12468
06:59:00,782 --> 06:59:01,382
úCHEAP.

12469
06:59:01,382 --> 06:59:03,985
IF YOU ARE WILLING TO BE PATIENT

12470
06:59:03,985 --> 06:59:06,087
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS YOU COULD

12471
06:59:06,087 --> 06:59:07,555
MAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY.

12472
06:59:07,555 --> 06:59:09,557
IF YOU SEEN THE VALUE OF YOUR

12473
06:59:09,557 --> 06:59:14,429
401(K) DECLINE A LITTLE BIT,

12474
06:59:14,429 --> 06:59:15,863
DON'T BE TERRIBLY CONCERNED.

12475
06:59:15,863 --> 06:59:18,032
PAY VERY CLOSE TO ATTENTION TO

12476
06:59:18,032 --> 06:59:18,565
RISING INTEREST RATES.

12477
06:59:18,565 --> 06:59:19,634
THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN EXCELLENT

12478
06:59:19,634 --> 06:59:21,269
INDICATION OF WHAT TO DO NEXT

12479
06:59:21,269 --> 06:59:23,037
AND THEN WATCH CORPORATE

12480
06:59:23,037 --> 06:59:24,238
EARNINGS IN THE WEEKS AHEAD.

12481
06:59:24,238 --> 06:59:24,872
THOSE COLLECTIVELY WILL GIVE YOU

12482
06:59:24,872 --> 06:59:28,643
THE KIND OF PICTURE YOU ARE

12483
06:59:28,643 --> 06:59:30,178
GOING TO NEED.

12484
06:59:30,178 --> 06:59:34,081
DON'T FORGET, THE UNDERLYING

12485
06:59:34,081 --> 06:59:34,983
FUNT FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL VERY

12486
06:59:34,983 --> 06:59:36,384
GOOD.

12487
06:59:36,384 --> 06:59:38,119
THEY ARE BE ABLE TO SPEND.

12488
06:59:38,119 --> 06:59:42,991
SPENDING DRIVES TWO-THIRDS OF

12489
06:59:42,991 --> 06:59:43,557
THIS ECONOMY.

12490
06:59:43,557 --> 06:59:44,425
THOSE SIMPLE EQUATIONS STILL

12491
06:59:44,425 --> 06:59:44,826
VERY GOOD.

12492
06:59:44,826 --> 06:59:49,664
I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE WILL

12493
06:59:49,664 --> 06:59:50,932
PROBABLY BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS.

12494

07:11:45,813 --> 07:11:46,079
AMERICANS.

IN A TWEET WEDNESDAY HE SAID HE

12735
07:11:48,148 --> 07:11:50,684
DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT THE

12736
07:11:50,684 --> 07:11:52,086
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ATTENDING.

12737
07:11:52,086 --> 07:11:54,888
HUH MIGHT FACE SOME SCRUTINY FOR

12738
07:11:54,888 --> 07:11:55,522
HIS DECISIONS.

12739
07:11:55,522 --> 07:11:57,324
MUCH LIKE THE CRITICISM HE GAVE

12740
07:11:57,324 --> 07:12:00,094
PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THE 2012

12741
07:12:00,094 --> 07:12:01,828
ELECTION AFTER HURRICANE SANDY.

12742
07:12:01,828 --> 07:12:04,264

12743
07:12:04,264 --> 07:12:05,599
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNED QUOTE

12744
07:12:05,599 --> 07:12:06,600
WHILE HURRICANE SANDY VICTIMS

12745
07:12:06,600 --> 07:12:08,769

12746
07:12:08,769 --> 07:12:14,374
ARE STILL DECEMBER DESIGNATED BY

12747
07:12:14,374 --> 07:12:16,342

12748
07:12:16,342 --> 07:12:17,310
DAVE -- DESIGNATED BY SANDY.

12749
07:12:17,310 --> 07:12:18,145
DAVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12750
07:12:18,145 --> 07:12:19,947
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE

12751
07:12:19,947 --> 07:12:22,149

>> THIS IS NOT A VISUAL THAT

12755
07:12:26,120 --> 07:12:30,724
MANY POLL -- POLITICIANS WOULD

12758
07:12:34,728 --> 07:12:36,497
ITS OBVIOUSLY A VERY POLITICAL

12759
07:12:36,497 --> 07:12:36,897
EVENT.

12760
07:12:36,897 --> 07:12:37,798
I THINK ITS MORE OF AN OPTICS

12761
07:12:37,798 --> 07:12:40,000
ISSUE THAT -- HE WILL SAY HIS

07:12:40,000 --> 07:12:42,403

07:13:24,778 --> 07:13:26,847
THEN YOU HAVE THE RACE TO

12784
07:13:26,847 --> 07:13:28,115
REPLACE RICK SCOTT AS GOVERNOR

12785
07:13:28,115 --> 07:13:29,516
IN ANDREW WHO IS THE MAYOR OF

12786
07:13:29,516 --> 07:13:31,685

WEEKS AWAY NOW FROM RACES THAT

12796
07:13:53,474 --> 07:13:54,340
LOOK LIKE TOSS UPS.

12797
07:13:54,340 --> 07:13:57,111
>> RIGHT.

12798
07:13:57,111 --> 07:13:58,278
THE PRESIDENT HAS ATTACKED

12799
07:13:58,278 --> 07:13:59,513
DEMOCRATS PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE.

12800
07:13:59,513 --> 07:14:02,082
HE DID THIS WEDNESDAY IN A RARE

12801
07:14:02,082 --> 07:14:03,049
OP-ED FOR U.S. A TODAY.

12802
07:14:03,049 --> 07:14:05,786
HE GOES TON PLEAD WITH VOTERS TO

12803
07:14:05,786 --> 07:14:07,453
CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR

12804
07:14:07,453 --> 07:14:08,054
REPUBLICANS SAYING QUOTE IF

12805
07:14:08,054 --> 07:14:10,290
DEMOCRATS WIN CONTROL OF THE

12806
07:14:10,290 --> 07:14:12,860
CONGRESS THIS NOVEMBER WE WILL

12807
07:14:12,860 --> 07:14:15,362
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSER TO

12808
07:14:15,362 --> 07:14:16,329
SOCIALISM IN AMERICA.

12809
07:14:16,329 --> 07:14:17,163
HOW TYPICAL IS THAT RHETORIC

12810
07:14:17,163 --> 07:14:19,399
FROM A PRESIDENT WEEKS AWAY FROM

12811
07:14:19,399 --> 07:14:19,732
THE MIDTERMS?

12812
07:14:19,732 --> 07:14:21,234
>> ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT THIS

12813
07:14:21,234 --> 07:14:23,604
OP-ED IS IT REALLY DOESN'T STAND

12814
07:14:23,604 --> 07:14:28,442
UP TO SCRUTINY FROM A FACTUAL

12815
07:14:28,442 --> 07:14:28,742
STANDPOINT.

12816
07:14:28,742 --> 07:14:33,213
THERE IS ALL SORTS OF FACT

SNUFF.

12821
07:14:38,718 --> 07:14:39,820
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT

12822
07:14:39,820 --> 07:14:41,488
HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

12823
07:14:41,488 --> 07:14:42,956
ADS ACROSS ALL THE MIDTERM RACES

12824
07:14:42,956 --> 07:14:44,324
IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, HEALTH

12825
07:14:44,324 --> 07:14:45,526
CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

12826
07:14:45,526 --> 07:14:48,561
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN

12827
07:14:48,561 --> 07:14:49,396
THEIR ADS.

12828
07:14:49,396 --> 07:14:49,863
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT.

12829
07:14:49,863 --> 07:14:50,964
REPUBLICANS ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE

12830
07:14:50,964 --> 07:14:51,632
A LITTLE BIT.

12831
07:14:51,632 --> 07:14:53,467
THEY MIGHT THINK THIS IS A

12832
07:14:53,467 --> 07:14:54,301
BETTER ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS.

12833
07:14:54,301 --> 07:14:55,803

07:17:44,071 --> 07:17:45,472
COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE AND

12914
07:17:45,472 --> 07:17:46,239
SAYING THE ESTABLISHMENT IS

12915
07:17:46,239 --> 07:17:49,543
DOING IT WRONG AND WE NEED TO

12916
07:17:49,543 --> 07:17:51,178
FIGHT TOUGH.

12917
07:17:51,178 --> 07:17:53,680
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO IS

12918
07:17:53,680 --> 07:17:54,113
SAYING THESE THINGS.

12919
07:17:54,113 --> 07:17:54,814
IT IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

12920
07:17:54,814 --> 07:17:57,317
IT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE THINK THE

12921
07:17:57,317 --> 07:17:59,386
MORAL HIGH GROUND IS ONLY WORTH

12922
07:17:59,386 --> 07:17:59,953
SO MUCH.

12923
07:17:59,953 --> 07:18:01,254
THEY ARE TIRED OF LOSING.

12924
07:18:01,254 --> 07:18:04,157
THIS IS KIND OF THE MICHAEL

12925
07:18:04,157 --> 07:18:05,958
SCHOOL OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.

12926
07:18:05,958 --> 07:18:08,061
HE HAS BEEN SAYING WE NEED TO

12927
07:18:08,061 --> 07:18:08,628
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

12928
07:18:08,628 --> 07:18:09,829
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF

12929
07:18:09,829 --> 07:18:12,065
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ON

12930
07:18:12,065 --> 07:18:13,700
THE BALLOT TAKE UP THAT MESSAGE

12931
07:18:13,700 --> 07:18:16,002
BECAUSE IF SO, IT'S GOING TO BE

12932
07:18:16,002 --> 07:18:16,770
AN EVEN UGLIER POLITICAL CYCLE

12933
07:18:16,770 --> 07:18:18,438
THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR.

12934
07:18:18,438 --> 07:18:24,344
>> RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT RELS --

12935
07:18:24,344 --> 07:18:28,148
ELSE ARE WE

12936
07:18:28,148 --> 07:18:29,616
SEEING FROM DEMOCRATS?

12937
07:18:29,616 --> 07:18:30,383
>> IT VARIES.

12938
07:18:30,383 --> 07:18:33,954
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO

12939
07:18:33,954 --> 07:18:35,589
ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT

12940
07:18:35,589 --> 07:18:36,256
TRUMP.

12941
07:18:36,256 --> 07:18:39,459
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US,

12942
07:18:39,459 --> 07:18:41,595
WHAT WE STAND FOR.

12943
07:18:41,595 --> 07:18:42,361
THAT IS A DIFFERENT MESSAGE.

12944
07:18:42,361 --> 07:18:44,297
THERE IS ALSO SO MUCH ANGER IN

12945
07:18:44,297 --> 07:18:44,597
THE BASE.

12946
07:18:44,597 --> 07:18:46,366
PEOPLE ARE FURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS

12947
07:18:46,366 --> 07:18:48,502
HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AND

12948
07:18:48,502 --> 07:18:50,069
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.

12949
07:18:50,069 --> 07:18:51,838
PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT AS

12950
07:18:51,838 --> 07:18:52,205
WELL.

12951
07:18:52,205 --> 07:18:55,442
SO I THINK ITS GOING TO BE A

12952
07:18:55,442 --> 07:18:57,310
TEST FOR PEOPLE LOOKING AHEAD TO

12953
07:18:57,310 --> 07:18:57,744
2020.

12954
07:18:57,744 --> 07:18:58,678
WILL YOU BE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE

12955
07:18:58,678 --> 07:19:03,083
THAT RUNS ANGRY OR ONE OF THESE

12956
07:19:03,083 --> 07:19:03,984
PEOPLE THAT RUNS WITH IDEAS?

12957
07:19:03,984 --> 07:19:09,690
IT IS A CHOICE DEMOCRATS WILL

12958
07:19:09,690 --> 07:19:11,758
HAVE TO

12959
07:19:11,758 --> 07:19:11,958
MAKE.

12960
07:19:11,958 --> 07:19:18,198
>> NIKKI HALEY REANNOUNCE HERD

12961
07:19:18,198 --> 07:19:22,235
PLAN -- ANNOUNCE HERD --

12962
07:19:22,235 --> 07:19:23,603
ANNOUNCED HER PLAN TO RESIGN.

12963
07:19:23,603 --> 07:19:28,809
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

12964
07:19:28,809 --> 07:19:29,443
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN

12965
07:19:29,443 --> 07:19:29,676
POLICY?

12966
07:19:29,676 --> 07:19:35,381
>> FIRST HE HAS TO FIND SOMEBODY

12967
07:19:35,381 --> 07:19:35,882
TO REPLACE HER.

12968
07:19:35,882 --> 07:19:37,316
YOU KNOW NIKKI HALEY IS AN

12969
07:19:37,316 --> 07:19:37,717
INTERESTING CASE.

12970
07:19:37,717 --> 07:19:40,086
SHE SOMEONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE

12971
07:19:40,086 --> 07:19:40,921
WHO SERVED IN THIS

12972
07:19:40,921 --> 07:19:42,322
ADMINISTRATION AND CAME OUT WITH

12973
07:19:42,322 --> 07:19:43,356
SORT OF HER STAR BURNING

12974
07:19:43,356 --> 07:19:45,959
BRIGHTER THAN WHEN SHE CAME INTO

12975
07:19:45,959 --> 07:19:46,593
THE ADMINISTRATION.

12976
07:19:46,593 --> 07:19:47,893
SHE IS SOMEBODY WITH NATIONAL

12977
07:19:47,893 --> 07:19:48,795
AMBITIONS AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE

12978
07:19:48,795 --> 07:19:50,263
PART OF WHAT PEOPLE IN TRUMP

12979
07:19:50,263 --> 07:19:51,465
WORLD WANTED TO DO WAS DAMP DOWN

12980
07:19:51,465 --> 07:19:53,867
THE IDEA SHE WAS GOING TO BE

12981
07:19:53,867 --> 07:19:54,634
CHALLENGING PRESIDENT TRUMP.

12982
07:19:54,634 --> 07:19:55,168
SHE DID THAT HERSELF.

12983
07:19:55,168 --> 07:19:57,304
SHE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON

12984
07:19:57,304 --> 07:20:03,410
THE BALLOT IN ANY -- AT ANY

12985
07:20:03,410 --> 07:20:03,777
LEVEL IN 2020.

12986
07:20:03,777 --> 07:20:04,511
I WILL SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT.

12987
07:20:04,511 --> 07:20:07,380

>> THANK YOU.

12990

07:20:58,665 --> 07:20:59,699
IS THAT ACTUALLY A FACT?

13018
07:20:59,699 --> 07:21:01,935
>> UM, WELL -- SO -- IN THIS

13019
07:21:01,935 --> 07:21:04,337

THE SHEER NUMBER OF DISASTERS.

13036
07:21:35,635 --> 07:21:37,170
NOT JUST THE SHEER NUMBER BUT

13037
07:21:37,170 --> 07:21:38,938
HOW INTENSE THESE DISASTERS HAVE

13038
07:21:38,938 --> 07:21:42,542
BEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A

13039
07:21:42,542 --> 07:21:42,742

RAINFALL TOTALS OF 4-6 INCHES

13094
07:23:09,496 --> 07:23:10,029
ALONG THE PATH.

13095
07:23:10,029 --> 07:23:17,070
>> IS IT UNUSUAL?

13096
07:23:17,070 --> 07:23:21,808
>> ACTUALLY THE GENERAL RULE OF

13097
07:23:21,808 --> 07:23:24,077
THUMB IS THAT IT LOSES ITS

13098
07:23:24,077 --> 07:23:24,710
INTENSITY IN TEN HOURS.

13099
07:23:24,710 --> 07:23:27,681
IT CAN STAY A HURRICANE FOR UP

13100
07:23:27,681 --> 07:23:28,347
TO TEN HOURS.

13101
07:23:28,347 --> 07:23:30,416
MOVING PRETTY FAST, THOSE WINDS

13102
07:23:30,416 --> 07:23:31,317
CAN PENETRATE VERY FAR INLAND.

13103
07:23:31,317 --> 07:23:34,521
>> SO IT IS NOT OVER YET IS THE

13104
07:23:34,521 --> 07:23:36,523
BOTTOM LINE.

13105
07:23:36,523 --> 07:23:36,957
>> UH-HUH.

DIRECT PATH OF HURRICANE MICHAEL

13131
07:27:11,604 --> 07:27:13,338
WHEN IT MADE LANDFALL WEDNESDAY

13132
07:27:13,338 --> 07:27:13,605
AFTERNOON.

13133
07:27:13,605 --> 07:27:15,909
YOU CAN SEE HERE SOME OF THE

13134
07:27:15,909 --> 07:27:17,009
DAMAGE WINDS DID THERE.

13135
07:27:17,009 --> 07:27:20,280
ROOFS WERE RIPPED OFF AND TREES

13136
07:27:20,280 --> 07:27:21,314
WERE BLOWN DOWN.

13137
07:27:21,314 --> 07:27:23,283
DEBRIS WAS BLOWING IN ALL

13138
07:27:23,283 --> 07:27:23,583

13141
07:27:27,220 --> 07:27:31,824
HILLARY, WHAT ARE THE CURRENT

13142
07:27:31,824 --> 07:27:33,459
CONDITIONS WHERE YOU ARE?

13143
07:27:33,459 --> 07:27:34,794
>> ELAINE, IT IS LITERALLY THE

13144
07:27:34,794 --> 07:27:35,861
CALM AFTER THE STORM.

13145
07:27:35,861 --> 07:27:37,296
THERE IS STILL SOME RESIDUAL

13146
07:27:37,296 --> 07:27:38,364
WIND BUT ITS SO DIFFERENT RIGHT

13147
07:27:38,364 --> 07:27:41,700
NOW COMPARED TO HOW IT WAS A FEW

13148
07:27:41,700 --> 07:27:42,001
HOURS AGO.

13149
07:27:42,001 --> 07:27:42,768
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME OUTSIDE

13150
07:27:42,768 --> 07:27:44,236
DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE STORM

13151
07:27:44,236 --> 07:27:47,339
BECAUSE IT JUST WOULD HAVE BEEN

13152
07:27:47,339 --> 07:27:47,907
TOO DANGEROUS.

13153
07:27:47,907 --> 07:27:50,075
WE WATCH ADD IT HAS WIND SNAPPED

13154
07:27:50,075 --> 07:27:50,643
ACROSS THE AREA.

13155
07:27:50,643 --> 07:27:54,414
THEY TOOK TONS OF PALM TREES

13156
07:27:54,414 --> 07:27:54,914
DOWN.

13157
07:27:54,914 --> 07:27:57,183
MANY SIGNS AND COMPLETELY ON THE

13158
07:27:57,183 --> 07:27:58,852
GROUND AND WIRES AS WELL.

13159
07:27:58,852 --> 07:28:00,986
TAKING POWER OUT ALL OVER THE

13160
07:28:00,986 --> 07:28:01,187
AREA.

13161
07:28:01,187 --> 07:28:03,256
AND WATER, THE RAIN JUST COMING

13162
07:28:03,256 --> 07:28:03,689
DOWN IN BUCKETS.

13163
07:28:03,689 --> 07:28:07,660
>> AND SO THERE IS NO POWER

13164
07:28:07,660 --> 07:28:10,596
WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?

13165
07:28:10,596 --> 07:28:11,029
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

13166
07:28:11,029 --> 07:28:13,733
CLOSE TO 200,000 PEOPLE IN THIS

13167
07:28:13,733 --> 07:28:14,867
AREA ARE WITHOUT POWER.

13168
07:28:14,867 --> 07:28:15,902
WE LOST POWER ACTUALLY BEFORE

13169
07:28:15,902 --> 07:28:18,604
THE BRUNT, BEFORE THE EYE CAME

13170
07:28:18,604 --> 07:28:19,505
THROUGH THIS AREA.

13171
07:28:19,505 --> 07:28:20,840
THAT'S THE SIMILAR SITUATION FOR

13172
07:28:20,840 --> 07:28:21,273
MANY PEOPLE.

13173
07:28:21,273 --> 07:28:23,309
NO WORD YET ON WHEN THE POWER

13174
07:28:23,309 --> 07:28:23,642
MIGHT COME ON.

13175
07:28:23,642 --> 07:28:25,478
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA HAS SAID

13176
07:28:25,478 --> 07:28:27,513
THE RESTORING POWER IS HIS

13177
07:28:27,513 --> 07:28:28,914
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BECAUSE ITS

13178
07:28:28,914 --> 07:28:30,516
VERY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY AS

13179
07:28:30,516 --> 07:28:31,917
PEOPLE BEGIN TO REBUILD.

13180
07:28:31,917 --> 07:28:33,419
>> SO HILLARY HAVE YOU SEEN

13181
07:28:33,419 --> 07:28:38,658
PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT AT ALL OR

13182
07:28:38,658 --> 07:28:39,058
FIRST RESPONDERS?

13183
07:28:39,058 --> 07:28:40,693
>> RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE STARTING

13184
07:28:40,693 --> 07:28:42,862
TO GET OUT AND SURVEY THE

13185
07:28:42,862 --> 07:28:43,262
DAMAGE.

13186
07:28:43,262 --> 07:28:43,996
THIS ROAD HAS BEEN VERY QUIET.

13187
07:28:43,996 --> 07:28:45,898
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE

13188
07:28:45,898 --> 07:28:46,866
DRIVE BY.

13189
07:28:46,866 --> 07:28:47,500
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING DURING

13190
07:28:47,500 --> 07:28:52,105
THIS STORM THE GOVERNOR SAID

13191
07:28:52,105 --> 07:28:57,977
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WOULD NOT BE

13192
07:28:57,977 --> 07:28:58,444
RESCUING PEOPLE.

13193
07:28:58,444 --> 07:28:59,144
THEY ARE SURVEYING THE DAMAGE TO

13194
07:28:59,144 --> 07:29:00,446
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING

13195
07:29:00,446 --> 07:29:01,014
ON.

13196
07:29:01,014 --> 07:29:05,284
AS THEY ARE DOING THAT, WE ARE

13197
07:29:05,284 --> 07:29:05,884
ALSO NOTICING RESIDENTSES ARE

13198
07:29:05,884 --> 07:29:06,185
COMING OUT.

13199
07:29:06,185 --> 07:29:08,254
>> AND HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO

13200
07:29:08,254 --> 07:29:09,989
TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT HOW THIS

13201
07:29:09,989 --> 07:29:12,758
MIGHT COMPARE TO OTHER STORMS

13202
07:29:12,758 --> 07:29:14,526
THAT HAVE HIT THE AREA?

13203
07:29:14,526 --> 07:29:15,761
>> WE HAVE.

13204
07:29:15,761 --> 07:29:16,896
I THINK UNIVERSAL THINK ONE

13205
07:29:16,896 --> 07:29:20,066
THING THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS

13206
07:29:20,066 --> 07:29:21,734
THIS HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.

13207
07:29:21,734 --> 07:29:23,302
FOR SOMETHING LIKE MARIA OR IRMA

13208
07:29:23,302 --> 07:29:24,603
OR FLORENCE IT WAS PREDICTED

13209
07:29:24,603 --> 07:29:26,738
ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE SO PEOPLE

13210
07:29:26,738 --> 07:29:28,407
HAD TIME TO PREPARE.

13211
07:29:28,407 --> 07:29:29,108
THIS HURRICANE FORMED SO

13212
07:29:29,108 --> 07:29:29,342
QUICKLY.

13213
07:29:29,342 --> 07:29:31,878
BY THE TIME PEOPLE WERE GETTING

13214
07:29:31,878 --> 07:29:32,578
THE MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDERS

13215
07:29:32,578 --> 07:29:39,452
HE DIDN'T -- THEY DIDN'T REALIZE

13216
07:29:39,452 --> 07:29:40,820
THERE WAS A STORM AT ALL.

13217
07:29:40,820 --> 07:29:41,888
THEY ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW

13218
07:29:41,888 --> 07:29:44,157
INTENSE THIS STORM WAS BUT ALSO

13219
07:29:44,157 --> 07:29:45,024
HOW FAST IT WAS.

13220
07:29:45,024 --> 07:29:46,559
IT REALLY SURPRISED US TOO.

13221
07:29:46,559 --> 07:29:49,128
THIS STORM CAME IN WITH SUCH

13222
07:29:49,128 --> 07:29:50,663
INTENSITY BUT ALSO LEFT VERY

13223
07:29:50,663 --> 07:29:50,930
QUICKLY.

13224
07:29:50,930 --> 07:29:52,365
>> I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STILL

13225
07:29:52,365 --> 07:29:54,333
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO GET A HANDLE

13226
07:29:54,333 --> 07:29:55,802
ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DAMAGE

13227
07:29:55,802 --> 07:29:58,538
THERE BUT IS THERE ANY SENSE AT

13228
07:29:58,538 --> 07:29:59,438
ALL FROM FOLKS WHAT THEIR

13229
07:29:59,438 --> 07:30:04,243
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO

13230
07:30:04,243 --> 07:30:06,511
BE AS THEY TRY TO RECOVER?

13231
07:30:06,511 --> 07:30:07,814
>> WELL JUST LIKE EVERY STORM

13232
07:30:07,814 --> 07:30:10,450
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE IS SOMETHING

13233
07:30:10,450 --> 07:30:11,818
THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY WORRIED

13234
07:30:11,818 --> 07:30:12,018
ABOUT.

13235
07:30:12,018 --> 07:30:14,120
WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH YOUR

13236
07:30:14,120 --> 07:30:15,087
FOUNDATION OR VERY EXPENSIVE

13237
07:30:15,087 --> 07:30:15,321
REPAIRS.

13238
07:30:15,321 --> 07:30:19,025
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST

13239
07:30:19,025 --> 07:30:19,625
OF THE STORM.

13240
07:30:19,625 --> 07:30:22,061
DOWNED POWER LINES AND TREES ARE

13241
07:30:22,061 --> 07:30:30,302
ALSO A CONCERN FOR PEOPLE.

13242
07:30:30,302 --> 07:30:33,372
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS VERY MUCH.

13243
07:30:33,372 --> 07:30:33,706
STAY SAFE.

13244
07:30:33,706 --> 07:30:38,978
>>> HURRICANE MICHAEL MAY BE ON

13245
07:30:38,978 --> 07:30:40,513
ITS WAY OUT BUT MILLIONS OF

13246
07:30:40,513 --> 07:30:45,318
PEOPLE ARE STILL IN ITS PATH.

13247
07:30:45,318 --> 07:30:46,285
CRAIG IS TRACKING THE STORM.

13248
07:30:46,285 --> 07:30:48,688
>> THE STORM CONTINUES TO MOVE

13249
07:30:48,688 --> 07:30:49,755
QUICKLY TO THE NORTHEAST.

13250
07:30:49,755 --> 07:30:51,023
THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE ITS

13251
07:30:51,023 --> 07:30:51,690
GOING TO PULL THE BAD WEATHER

13252
07:30:51,690 --> 07:30:54,127
OUT OF THE AREA THAT WAS MOST

13253
07:30:54,127 --> 07:30:54,427
IMPACTED.

13254
07:30:54,427 --> 07:30:56,528
THE WIND FIELD IS STILL RATHER

13255
07:30:56,528 --> 07:30:57,029
LARGE.

13256
07:30:57,029 --> 07:30:57,964
SPECIALLY NEAR THE CORE THE

13257
07:30:57,964 --> 07:30:59,132
WINDS ARE VERY STRONG.

13258
07:30:59,132 --> 07:31:05,037
THE FUTURE TRACK TAKES IT TO THE

13259
07:31:05,037 --> 07:31:05,872
NORTHEAST.

13260
07:31:05,872 --> 07:31:06,472
DURING THE DAY TOMORROW MOVES

13261
07:31:06,472 --> 07:31:07,740
QUICKLY THROUGH THE CAROLINAS

13262
07:31:07,740 --> 07:31:09,942
AND THEN OFF THE EAST COAST BY

13263
07:31:09,942 --> 07:31:11,277
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY

13264
07:31:11,277 --> 07:31:12,444
MORNING.

13265
07:31:12,444 --> 07:31:13,846
ITS OUT TO SEA AFTER THAT.

13266
07:31:13,846 --> 07:31:17,884
THE MAIN THING IS GOING TO BE A

13267
07:31:17,884 --> 07:31:19,118
WIDESPREAD WIND FIELD THAT WILL

13268
07:31:19,118 --> 07:31:21,420
CONTINUE TO DO A LOT TREE

13269
07:31:21,420 --> 07:31:21,721
DAMAGE.

13270
07:31:21,721 --> 07:31:23,823
POWER OUTAGES ARE TO BE EXPECTED

13271
07:31:23,823 --> 07:31:25,358
FROM GEORGIA THROUGH THE

13272
07:31:25,358 --> 07:31:25,625
CAROLINAS.

13273
07:31:25,625 --> 07:31:27,627

VIRGINIA AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF

13275
07:31:29,395 --> 07:31:29,729
DELAWARE.

13276
07:31:29,729 --> 07:31:31,297
THE WINDS ARE GOING TO GRADUALLY

13277
07:31:31,297 --> 07:31:32,632
COME DOWN THE MOST INTENSE

13278
07:31:32,632 --> 07:31:32,832
WINDS.

13279
07:31:32,832 --> 07:31:34,300
AS THE STORM MOVES ALONG THE

13280
07:31:34,300 --> 07:31:36,102
WIND FIELD SPREADS OUT A BIT

13281
07:31:36,102 --> 07:31:37,670
BECAUSE THE STORM IS WEAKENING.

13282
07:31:37,670 --> 07:31:39,338
IN TERMS OF RAINFALL, ANOTHER

13283
07:31:39,338 --> 07:31:40,740
GOOD REASON OR ANOTHER GOOD

13284
07:31:40,740 --> 07:31:41,908
THING THAT THIS FAST MOVEMENT IS

13285
07:31:41,908 --> 07:31:44,177
THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE

13286
07:31:44,177 --> 07:31:45,143
EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL.

13287
07:31:45,143 --> 07:31:47,647
THERE IS THE THREAT FOR SOME

13288
07:31:47,647 --> 07:31:48,848
FLASH FLOODING ALONG THE TRACK

13289
07:31:48,848 --> 07:31:53,419

SYSTEM.

13293
07:31:56,021 --> 07:31:57,190
THERE IS ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF

13294
07:31:57,190 --> 07:31:59,125
TORNADOS ALONG AND TO THE RIGHT

13295
07:31:59,125 --> 07:32:02,494
OF THE TRACK.

13296
07:32:02,494 --> 07:32:08,668
THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH THIS FAST

13310
07:32:49,308 --> 07:32:49,775
THAT WASN'T WORKING.

13311

MY HUSBAND NOTICED THAT HER ARM

13316
07:33:00,219 --> 07:33:00,953
WAS KIND OF JUST HANGING THERE.

13317
07:33:00,953 --> 07:33:06,425
>> SHE HAD LOST ALL FUNCTION IN

13318
07:33:06,425 --> 07:33:11,163
HER RIGHT ARM.

13319
07:33:11,163 --> 07:33:16,903
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AFM.

13320

PARALYZED.

13323
07:33:21,641 --> 07:33:27,280
>> ABOUT HALF THE KIDS WITH AFM

13324
07:33:27,280 --> 07:33:33,452
WILL STRENGTHEN UP ENOUGH ON

13325
07:33:33,452 --> 07:33:34,086
THEIR OWN.

13326
07:33:34,086 --> 07:33:35,554

13330
07:33:40,960 --> 07:33:42,261

TAKING NERVES FROM HER RIBS AND

13332
07:33:43,663 --> 07:33:45,931

YOU HAVE TO GET IN THERE BY 8 TO

10 MONTHS IDEALLY.

13338
07:33:58,577 --> 07:34:00,279
AT THAT POINT YOU RUN THE RISK

13339
07:34:00,279 --> 07:34:03,282
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO REVERSE THE

13340
07:34:03,282 --> 07:34:03,549
PARALYSIS.

13341

EVEN MORE IMPROVEMENT

13360
07:38:21,073 --> 07:38:21,539
OUT OF CONTROL. 

13361
07:38:21,539 --> 07:38:24,042
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 

13362
07:38:24,042 --> 07:38:24,342
PEOPLE DIE. 

13363
07:38:24,342 --> 07:38:32,485

13383
07:39:14,093 --> 07:39:19,932
CATEGORY 1 STORM, BUT STILL HAS 

13384

THE HURRICANE HAS SLOWED A BIT, 

13392
07:39:31,276 --> 07:39:32,944
BUT IS STILL DELIVERING A HEAVY 

13393
07:39:32,944 --> 07:39:34,980

13402
07:39:46,125 --> 07:39:49,395
IS IT IS NOW JUST ABOUT TO 

13403
07:39:49,395 --> 07:39:49,795
ALBANY, GEORGIA. 

13404
07:39:49,795 --> 07:39:51,363

13405
07:39:51,363 --> 07:39:54,299
THEY ARE OUT OF THE RAIN IN 

13406
07:39:54,299 --> 07:39:56,235
ALMOST THE ENTIRETY OF THE

STATE OF FLORIDA. 

13408
07:39:56,635 --> 07:39:58,804
SO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 

13409
07:39:58,804 --> 07:39:59,804
THERE'S THE BACK, THAT'S IT. 

13410
07:39:59,804 --> 07:40:01,473
THAT'S ALL THE RAIN IN THE 

13411
07:40:01,473 --> 07:40:01,973

WE'RE DOWN NOW TO 85 MILES PER

07:40:03,508 --> 07:40:03,708
HOUR. 

13414
07:40:03,708 --> 07:40:05,010
SO WE DROP 5 MILES AN HOUR OFF 

13415
07:40:05,010 --> 07:40:06,545
THE LAST HOUR. 

13416
07:40:06,545 --> 07:40:08,981
BUT LOOK AT HOW FAST IT'S 

13417
07:40:08,981 --> 07:40:09,214
MOVING. 

13418
07:40:09,214 --> 07:40:10,449
IT'S MOVING NORTHEAST AT 17 

13419
07:40:10,449 --> 07:40:11,549
MILES AN HOUR. 

13420
07:40:11,549 --> 07:40:13,318
SO IT IS ON ITS HORSE. 

13421
07:40:13,318 --> 07:40:16,956
IT WILL BE IN THE CAROLINAS BY 

13422
07:40:16,956 --> 07:40:18,424
TOMORROW MORNING, AND IN SOUTH 

13423
07:40:18,424 --> 07:40:18,924
CAROLINA SPECIFICALLY. 

13424
07:40:18,924 --> 07:40:21,927
THEN IT WILL BE OFF THE COAST 

13425
07:40:21,927 --> 07:40:23,094
OF THE DELMARVA BY FRIDAY 

13426
07:40:23,094 --> 07:40:23,361

THERE'S A LOOK AT THE MAP. 

13433
07:40:35,607 --> 07:40:37,009

07:40:42,614 --> 07:40:44,783
YOU WILL BE DOWN TO ALMOST THE 

13441
07:40:44,783 --> 07:40:46,518
EDGE OF BEING A TROPICAL STORM 

13442
07:40:46,518 --> 07:40:47,853
AT 2:00 P.M. 

13443
07:40:47,853 --> 07:40:48,120
THURSDAY. 

13444
07:40:48,120 --> 07:40:49,421
THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT GOING OVER 

13445
07:40:49,421 --> 07:40:52,124
LAND WILL DO TO YOU, IF YOU'RE 

13446
07:40:52,124 --> 07:40:53,959
A TROPICAL STORM. 

13447
07:40:53,959 --> 07:40:55,494
BUT STILL BRINGING RAIN AND 

13448
07:40:55,494 --> 07:40:56,595
SOME OF THE WORST EFFECTS 

13449
07:40:56,595 --> 07:40:59,164
ACTUALLY TO THE WEST OF THE 

13450
07:40:59,164 --> 07:40:59,998
CENTER OF THE TRACK. 

13451
07:40:59,998 --> 07:41:01,266
>> WHAT ARE THE THINGS 

13452
07:41:01,266 --> 07:41:02,801
SPECIFICALLY THAT PEOPLE IN 

13453
07:41:02,801 --> 07:41:03,702
THOSE AREAS NEED TO BE 

13454
07:41:03,702 --> 07:41:04,102
CONCERNED ABOUT? 

13455
07:41:04,102 --> 07:41:05,637
>> SO RAIN IS A BIG CONCERN IN 

13456
07:41:05,637 --> 07:41:07,940
TERMS OF FLASH FLOODING. 

13457
07:41:07,940 --> 07:41:09,975
THERE'S A FLASH FLOOD WATCH 

13458
07:41:09,975 --> 07:41:11,210
THAT GOES ACTUALLY ALL THE WAY 

13459
07:41:11,210 --> 07:41:12,444
ALMOST UP TO BOSTON. 

13460
07:41:12,444 --> 07:41:14,213
4 TO 6 INCHES OF RAIN IS 

13461
07:41:14,213 --> 07:41:15,380
POSSIBLE JUST IN THAT PORTION 

13462
07:41:15,380 --> 07:41:18,150
OF NORTHERN GEORGIA, INTO SOUTH 

13463
07:41:18,150 --> 07:41:18,450
CAROLINA. 

13464
07:41:18,450 --> 07:41:21,186
THERE'S ANOTHER AREA AGAIN FROM 

13465
07:41:21,186 --> 07:41:28,827
NORTH CAROLINA UP INTO 

13466
07:41:28,827 --> 07:41:29,228
VIRGINIA. 

13467
07:41:29,228 --> 07:41:31,664
AND PARTICULARLY, WHERE YOU'VE 

13468
07:41:31,664 --> 07:41:33,599
GOT SOME TOPOGRAPHY THERE, 

13469
07:41:33,599 --> 07:41:34,733
YOU'VE GOT MUDSLIDES WITH WIND 

13470
07:41:34,733 --> 07:41:37,302
LOOSENING UP THE SOIL, ALL OF 

13471
07:41:37,302 --> 07:41:37,502
THAT. 

13472
07:41:37,502 --> 07:41:39,705
THE GROUND IS ALREADY SATURATED 

13473
07:41:39,705 --> 07:41:40,072
FROM FLORENCE. 

13474
07:41:40,072 --> 07:41:41,907
THE WINDS ARE STILL FAIRLY 

13475
07:41:41,907 --> 07:41:42,107
FULL. 

13476
07:41:42,107 --> 07:41:44,242
THAT'S A BIG CONCERN. 

13477
07:41:44,242 --> 07:41:46,412
AND THEN THE WIND, THOUGH 

13478
07:41:46,412 --> 07:41:47,245
DECREASING CONSIDERABLY, A 60 

13479
07:41:47,245 --> 07:41:50,082
MILE-AN-HOUR GUST CAN TAKE DOWN 

13480
07:41:50,082 --> 07:41:50,315
TREES. 

13481
07:41:50,315 --> 07:41:54,853
IT WOULDN'T BE OUT OF THE REALM 

13482
07:41:54,853 --> 07:41:56,488
OF POSSIBLY TO SEE MORE POWER 

13483
07:41:56,488 --> 07:41:56,755
OUTAGES. 

13484
07:41:56,755 --> 07:41:58,724
>> JUST HOW WAS THIS STORM ABLE 

13485
07:41:58,724 --> 07:41:59,390
TO INTENSIFY SO QUICKLY. 

13486
07:41:59,390 --> 07:42:02,094
>> THE INTERESTING THING IS WE 

13487
07:42:02,094 --> 07:42:04,930
WENT FROM 90 MILES PER HOUR AT 

13488
07:42:04,930 --> 07:42:05,564
5:00 A.M. 

13489
07:42:05,564 --> 07:42:08,000
ON TUESDAY, ALL MY DAYS ARE 

13490
07:42:08,000 --> 07:42:11,503
RUNNING TOGETHER NOW, TO 1:55 

13491
07:42:11,503 --> 07:42:11,836
AT 1:00 P.M. 

13492
07:42:11,836 --> 07:42:15,073
THIS IS ALL EAST COAST TIME, ON 

13493
07:42:15,073 --> 07:42:15,774
WEDNESDAY. 

13494
07:42:15,774 --> 07:42:17,609
SO IN ABOUT 32 HOURS WE ALMOST 

13495
07:42:17,609 --> 07:42:19,111
GAINED NEARLY 70 MILES AN HOUR 

13496
07:42:19,111 --> 07:42:20,712
ON THAT STORM. 

13497
07:42:20,712 --> 07:42:23,315
SO THAT SHOWS YOU JUST HOW 

13498
07:42:23,315 --> 07:42:24,349
QUICKLY IT INTENSIFIED. 

13499
07:42:24,349 --> 07:42:26,085
WE HAD WARM WATER. 

13500
07:42:26,085 --> 07:42:28,186
WE HAD WATER THAT WAS SOMEWHERE 

13501
07:42:28,186 --> 07:42:31,690
BETWEEN IN FAHRENHEIT, 3 AND 6 

13502
07:42:31,690 --> 07:42:32,357
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 

13503
07:42:32,357 --> 07:42:35,627
THE GULF IS ALWAYS BATH WATER. 

13504
07:42:35,627 --> 07:42:36,828
IT ALWAYS TURBO CHARGES STORMS, 

13505
07:42:36,828 --> 07:42:38,229
BUT THIS WAS EVEN MORE SO. 

13506
07:42:38,229 --> 07:42:39,798
THERE WAS SOME DRY AIR. 

13507
07:42:39,798 --> 07:42:41,133
IT DIDN'T WORK ITS WAY IN, SO 

13508
07:42:41,133 --> 07:42:46,070
YOU'VE GOT A STORM THAT WAS 

13509
07:42:46,070 --> 07:42:50,075
BOTH RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING, AND 

13510
07:42:50,075 --> 07:42:50,942
RAPIDLY DEEPENING. 

13511
07:42:50,942 --> 07:42:52,277
A RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING STORM IS 

13512
07:42:52,277 --> 07:42:56,548
THE STORM WHERE THE WINDS ARE 

13513
07:42:56,548 --> 07:42:57,482
INCREASING AT A CLIP. 

13514
07:42:57,482 --> 07:42:58,950
IT'S AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP. 

13515
07:42:58,950 --> 07:43:00,118
THE LOWER THE PRESSURE, THE 

13516
07:43:00,118 --> 07:43:01,353
HIGHER THE WINDS, BUT IN TERMS 

13517
07:43:01,353 --> 07:43:03,488
OF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE 

13518
07:43:03,488 --> 07:43:12,364
STRONGEST EVER, RIGHT, THIS IS 

13519
07:43:12,364 --> 07:43:13,498
THE THIRD STRONGEST BY PRESSURE 

13520
07:43:13,498 --> 07:43:15,533
STORM IN U.S. RECORDED HISTORY. 

13521
07:43:15,533 --> 07:43:17,770
IF YOU ONLY COUNT THE SATELLITE 

13522
07:43:17,770 --> 07:43:20,239
AREA, IT'S ACTUALLY NUMBER 2. A 

13523
07:43:20,239 --> 07:43:20,806
TRULY RARE STORM, THAT 

13524
07:43:20,806 --> 07:43:21,507
SEEMINGLY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, 

13525
07:43:21,507 --> 07:43:23,275
IT ALWAYS HAD THE CHANCE TO DO 

13526
07:43:23,275 --> 07:43:26,245
IT, BUT WE FELT THAT, OH, 

13527
07:43:26,245 --> 07:43:29,181
BETWEEN THE SHEER AND THE DRY 

13528
07:43:29,181 --> 07:43:30,581
AIR, IT'S NOT GOING TO GET 

13529
07:43:30,581 --> 07:43:30,815
THERE. 

13530
07:43:30,815 --> 07:43:31,416
AT 8:00 P.M. 

13531
07:43:31,416 --> 07:43:33,685
LAST NIGHT, WE SAW THE CLOUDS 

13532
07:43:33,685 --> 07:43:35,020
WERE STARTING TO BILLOW. 

13533
07:43:35,020 --> 07:43:36,321
THEY WERE GETTING REALLY COLD, 

13534
07:43:36,321 --> 07:43:38,757
AND WE KNEW IT WAS OFF TO THE 

13535
07:43:38,757 --> 07:43:39,157
RACES THEN. 

13536
07:43:39,157 --> 07:43:40,225
AT THAT POINT. 

13537
07:43:40,225 --> 07:43:41,059
THAT'S WHY, WHEN WE REALIZED 

13538
07:43:41,059 --> 07:43:43,328
JUST HOW BAD THIS WAS GOING TO 

13539
07:43:43,328 --> 07:43:43,528
BE. 

13540
07:43:43,528 --> 07:43:47,099
IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE AT THAT 

13541
07:43:47,099 --> 07:43:48,400
POINT, WHICH IS WHY WHEN THOSE 

13542
07:43:48,400 --> 07:43:49,868
MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDERS 

13543
07:43:49,868 --> 07:43:51,436
COME OUT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

13544
07:43:51,436 --> 07:43:53,071
FOLLOW THEM THEN, AND NOT THE 

13545
07:43:53,071 --> 07:43:55,306
11th HOUR OH, NO, BECAUSE THAT 

13546
07:43:55,306 --> 07:43:56,541
PUTS YOU IN DANGER. 

13547
07:43:56,541 --> 07:43:57,542
>> DAVID PARKINSON, THANKS SO 

13548
07:43:57,542 --> 07:43:58,176
MUCH, DAVID. 

13549
07:43:58,176 --> 07:43:58,777
>> SURE THING. 

13550
07:43:58,777 --> 07:44:02,948
>>> ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT 

13551
07:44:02,948 --> 07:44:04,783
AREAS IS PANAMA CITY BEACH, 

13552
07:44:04,783 --> 07:44:07,552
JUST WEST OF WHERE MICHAEL MADE 

13553
07:44:07,552 --> 07:44:10,489
LANDFALL, RIPPING OFF ROOFS, 

13554
07:44:10,489 --> 07:44:11,690
BLOWING DOWN TREES, AND SENDING 

13555
07:44:11,690 --> 07:44:13,357
DEBRIS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. 

13556
07:44:13,357 --> 07:44:18,230

13558
07:44:19,331 --> 07:44:21,733
UNMISTAKABLE. 

13559
07:44:21,733 --> 07:44:24,803

07:44:24,803 --> 07:44:30,475

13565
07:44:42,087 --> 07:44:42,654
BLASTED AWAY. 

13566
07:44:42,654 --> 07:44:45,924
WE'RE NOW APPROACHING THE WORST 

13567
07:44:45,924 --> 07:44:46,591
OF HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

13568

13570
07:44:50,495 --> 07:44:52,130

13571
07:44:52,130 --> 07:44:53,365

LONGER RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY

07:46:42,074 --> 07:46:43,408
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. 

13626
07:46:43,408 --> 07:46:45,644
HEAVY RAINS, AND TREE SNAPPING 

13627
07:46:45,644 --> 07:46:47,512
WINDS PUMMELED THE FLORIDA 

13628
07:46:47,512 --> 07:46:47,812
PANHANDLE. 

13629
07:46:47,812 --> 07:46:49,247
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RODE OUT 

13630
07:46:49,247 --> 07:46:51,883
THE STORM AT HOME, DESPITE 

13631
07:46:51,883 --> 07:46:53,819
BEING TOLD TO GET OUT. 

13632
07:46:53,819 --> 07:46:56,455
PORT ST. JOE RESIDENTS WENT 

13633
07:46:56,455 --> 07:46:57,189
INTO RESCUE MODE AFTER 

13634
07:46:57,189 --> 07:47:00,826
MICHAEL'S 12-FOOT STORM SURGE 

13635
07:47:00,826 --> 07:47:04,262
TRAPPED PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. 

13636
07:47:04,262 --> 07:47:05,697
VOLUNTEERS IN SMALL BOATS AND 

13637
07:47:05,697 --> 07:47:08,000
BIG TRUCKS PUSHED THROUGH 

13638
07:47:08,000 --> 07:47:09,768
STREETS BLOCKED BY TREES, AND 

13639
07:47:09,768 --> 07:47:11,837
SUBMERGED IN SEVERAL FEET OF 

13640
07:47:11,837 --> 07:47:12,070
WATER. 

13641
07:47:12,070 --> 07:47:14,072
DONNA HADDOCK DIDN'T HAVE A WAY 

13642
07:47:14,072 --> 07:47:15,707
TO CHECK ON HER FAMILY, SO SHE 

13643
07:47:15,707 --> 07:47:18,142
USED OUR CELL PHONE TO TELL HER 

13644
07:47:18,142 --> 07:47:19,911
TRAPPED NEPHEW, THAT HELP WAS 

13645
07:47:19,911 --> 07:47:20,545
ON THE WAY. 

13646
07:47:20,545 --> 07:47:21,580
WITHIN MINUTES, A DRIVER IN A 

13647
07:47:21,580 --> 07:47:25,217
BIG PICKUP TRUCK PULLED UP TO 

13648
07:47:25,217 --> 07:47:26,651
THE WATERLOGGED HOUSE, AND 

13649
07:47:26,651 --> 07:47:28,687
CARRIED JEFF PITS AND HIS DOG 

13650
07:47:28,687 --> 07:47:29,621
BUDDY TO HIGHER GROUND. 

13651
07:47:29,621 --> 07:47:30,521
>> HOW WAS THE WATER LEVELS? 

13652
07:47:30,521 --> 07:47:32,424
>> GOT UP TO 4 FEET IN THE 

13653
07:47:32,424 --> 07:47:32,657
HOUSE. 

13654
07:47:32,657 --> 07:47:33,191
>> IN THE HOUSE? 

13655
07:47:33,191 --> 07:47:36,094
>> IN THE HOUSE UP TO ABOUT MY 

13656
07:47:36,094 --> 07:47:36,361
HIP. 

13657
07:47:36,361 --> 07:47:38,230
>> Reporter: THE DRIVER WAS A 

13658
07:47:38,230 --> 07:47:38,863
MAN NAMED CHRIS. 

13659
07:47:38,863 --> 07:47:40,599
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TALK AS 

13660
07:47:40,599 --> 07:47:44,302
HE DROVE BACK TO HELP MORE 

13661
07:47:44,302 --> 07:47:44,535
PEOPLE. 

13662
07:47:44,535 --> 07:47:48,373
BUT HIS ACTIONS SAID PLENTY IN 

13663
07:47:48,373 --> 07:47:49,274
THIS SMALL COMMUNITY. 

13664
07:47:49,274 --> 07:47:51,910
>> WHERE WOULD THESE PEOPLE BE 

13665
07:47:51,910 --> 07:47:53,178
WITHOUT PEOPLE WITH BIG TRUCKS 

13666
07:47:53,178 --> 07:47:53,811
AND BOATS? 

13667
07:47:53,811 --> 07:47:54,712
>> WHERE IS ANYBODY WITHOUT 

13668
07:47:54,712 --> 07:47:55,213
FRIENDS? 

13669
07:47:55,213 --> 07:47:57,315
>> Reporter: EVEN AS THIS STORM 

13670
07:47:57,315 --> 07:47:58,550
WAS PASSING OVERHEAD, 

13671
07:47:58,550 --> 07:47:59,751
VOLUNTEERS CAME OUT WITH 

13672
07:47:59,751 --> 07:48:00,585
CHAINSAWS, WORKING TO CLEAR THE 

13673
07:48:00,585 --> 07:48:02,020
STREETS OF DOWNED TREES. 

13674
07:48:02,020 --> 07:48:04,056
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY, 

13675
07:48:04,056 --> 07:48:06,424
HURRICANE FORCED WINDS DAMAGED 

13676
07:48:06,424 --> 07:48:07,592
BUILDINGS, AND EVEN FLIPPED 

13677
07:48:07,592 --> 07:48:09,293
OVER THIS RV. 

13678
07:48:09,293 --> 07:48:11,095
AS PEOPLE ASSESS THE DAMAGE, 

13679
07:48:11,095 --> 07:48:12,397
DONNA IS JUST THANKFUL SHE 

13680
07:48:12,397 --> 07:48:14,432
SURVIVED ONE OF THE BIGGEST 

13681
07:48:14,432 --> 07:48:15,667
HURRICANES TO HIT THE FLORIDA 

13682
07:48:15,667 --> 07:48:16,068
PANHANDLE. 

13683
07:48:16,068 --> 07:48:17,602
>> HOW WAS IT TO FINALLY SEE 

13684
07:48:17,602 --> 07:48:19,271
HIM ON THE BACK OF THAT TRUCK? 

13685
07:48:19,271 --> 07:48:21,072
>> THAT WAS GOOD. 

13686
07:48:21,072 --> 07:48:22,174
GOOD. 

13687
07:48:22,174 --> 07:48:29,381
WE CAN REST EASY NOW. 

13688
07:48:29,381 --> 07:48:31,583
>> CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT, OMAR 

13689
07:48:31,583 --> 07:48:32,150
VILLAFRANCA JOINS ME. 

13690
07:48:32,150 --> 07:48:33,418
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT CONDITIONS 

13691
07:48:33,418 --> 07:48:33,952
WHERE YOU ARE? 

13692
07:48:33,952 --> 07:48:35,253
>> Reporter: IT IS STILL VERY 

13693
07:48:35,253 --> 07:48:35,486
WINDY. 

13694
07:48:35,486 --> 07:48:37,389
THE WIND IS COMING THROUGH AT A 

13695
07:48:37,389 --> 07:48:37,789
GOOD CLIP HERE. 

13696
07:48:37,789 --> 07:48:39,124
IT WILL COME UP, AND IT WILL 

13697
07:48:39,124 --> 07:48:42,093
DIE DOWN A BIT, BUT WE ARE 

13698
07:48:42,093 --> 07:48:43,194
STILL GETTING STEADY GUSTS. 

13699
07:48:43,194 --> 07:48:43,494
TWO THINGS. 

13700
07:48:43,494 --> 07:48:44,996
THE RAIN HAS REALLY STOPPED IN 

13701
07:48:44,996 --> 07:48:46,098
THIS AREA, AND SOME OF THE 

13702
07:48:46,098 --> 07:48:47,566
FLOODING, SOME OF THE STORM 

13703
07:48:47,566 --> 07:48:49,300
SURGE THAT WE SAW EARLIER IS 

13704
07:48:49,300 --> 07:48:50,902
STARTING TO RECEDE A LITTLE 

13705
07:48:50,902 --> 07:48:51,203
BIT. 

13706
07:48:51,203 --> 07:48:54,172
THE BIG ISSUE IS GOING TO BE OF 

13707
07:48:54,172 --> 07:48:54,572
COURSE, CLEANUP. 

13708
07:48:54,572 --> 07:48:56,875
THAT IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM 

13709
07:48:56,875 --> 07:48:57,275
THING. 

13710
07:48:57,275 --> 07:48:59,110
WE'VE SEEN TREES DOWN. 

13711
07:48:59,110 --> 07:49:00,445
WE'VE SEEN, MATTER OF FACT, 

13712
07:49:00,445 --> 07:49:02,180
PIECES OF FENCE THAT ARE 

13713
07:49:02,180 --> 07:49:04,216
BASICALLY JUST STREWN ABOUT 

13714
07:49:04,216 --> 07:49:05,549
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND ENDED UP 

13715
07:49:05,549 --> 07:49:06,651
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S YARDS AS 

13716
07:49:06,651 --> 07:49:06,985
WELL. 

13717
07:49:06,985 --> 07:49:09,087
THIS IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE 

13718
07:49:09,087 --> 07:49:11,123
LONG TERM PROCESS OF THE 

13719
07:49:11,123 --> 07:49:11,389
CLEANUP. 

13720
07:49:11,389 --> 07:49:12,490
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO SHOW 

13721
07:49:12,490 --> 07:49:13,191
YOU OVER HERE. 

13722
07:49:13,191 --> 07:49:19,898
SEE IF YOU CAN SEE IT. 

13723
07:49:19,898 --> 07:49:22,200
THE PANHANDLE HAS A LOT OF 

13724
07:49:22,200 --> 07:49:23,435
THESE PALM TREES, WHEN IT'S 

13725
07:49:23,435 --> 07:49:24,469
HURRICANE TIME, THEY'LL SNAP IN 

13726
07:49:24,469 --> 07:49:26,771
HALF AND BRING DOWN ALL THE 

13727
07:49:26,771 --> 07:49:27,272
POWER LINES. 

13728
07:49:27,272 --> 07:49:28,807
THAT ONE IS PROBABLY, MAYBE 50, 

13729
07:49:28,807 --> 07:49:30,408
60 FEET, BUT IT'S SNAPPED RIGHT 

13730
07:49:30,408 --> 07:49:32,377
IN THE CENTER. 

13731
07:49:32,377 --> 07:49:34,212
A LOT OF THOSE ARE BLOCKING THE 

13732
07:49:34,212 --> 07:49:34,512
ROADS. 

13733
07:49:34,512 --> 07:49:36,448
A LOT OF THOSE HAVE PULLED DOWN 

13734
07:49:36,448 --> 07:49:37,382
POWER LINES, AND THAT'S GOING 

13735
07:49:37,382 --> 07:49:41,453
TO BE A MAJOR PART OF THE 

13736
07:49:41,453 --> 07:49:42,187
CLEANUP HERE. 

13737
07:49:42,187 --> 07:49:43,722
>> TELL US, OMAR, WHAT ABOUT 

13738
07:49:43,722 --> 07:49:45,223
FIRST RESPONDERS? 

13739
07:49:45,223 --> 07:49:46,091
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM OUT AND 

13740
07:49:46,091 --> 07:49:46,324
ABOUT? 

13741
07:49:46,324 --> 07:49:48,026
>> Reporter: WE ARE STARTING TO 

13742
07:49:48,026 --> 07:49:49,060
SEE THEM TRICKLE OUT. 

13743
07:49:49,060 --> 07:49:50,095
WE DID SEE SHERIFF DEPUTIES 

13744
07:49:50,095 --> 07:49:51,362
HERE IN GULF COUNTY. 

13745
07:49:51,362 --> 07:49:53,597
THEY WERE KIND OF CRUISING 

13746
07:49:53,597 --> 07:49:53,831
AROUND. 

13747
07:49:53,831 --> 07:49:54,699
BUT THEY HAD BASICALLY LIMITED 

13748
07:49:54,699 --> 07:49:56,334
CAPABILITIES OF WHAT THEY COULD 

13749
07:49:56,334 --> 07:49:56,868
DO. 

13750
07:49:56,868 --> 07:49:58,203
MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF THE 

13751
07:49:58,203 --> 07:49:59,504
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS HERE TOLD 

13752
07:49:59,504 --> 07:50:02,340
US THAT THE HOSPITALS ARE 

13753
07:50:02,340 --> 07:50:02,574
CLOSED. 

13754
07:50:02,574 --> 07:50:03,808
ALL THE AMBULANCES ARE FARTHER 

13755
07:50:03,808 --> 07:50:04,042
INLAND. 

13756
07:50:04,042 --> 07:50:05,443
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL HELP, IT'S 

13757
07:50:05,443 --> 07:50:08,079
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER 

13758
07:50:08,079 --> 07:50:08,379
THE STORM. 

13759
07:50:08,379 --> 07:50:12,350
WE DID SEE SOME PORT ST. JOE 

13760
07:50:12,350 --> 07:50:12,583
POLICE. 

13761
07:50:12,583 --> 07:50:14,519
THEY HAD ONE OF THESE M WRAPS. 

13762
07:50:14,519 --> 07:50:16,087
THEY WENT INTO THIS 

13763
07:50:16,087 --> 07:50:16,587
NEIGHBORHOOD BEHIND ME. 

13764
07:50:16,587 --> 07:50:18,323
SOME OF THESE HOMES WERE UNDER 

13765
07:50:18,323 --> 07:50:20,291
4 FEET OF WATER. 

13766
07:50:20,291 --> 07:50:21,926
WE SAW THEM PULL OUT AN ELDERLY 

13767
07:50:21,926 --> 07:50:23,895
COUPLE, AND TAKE THEM TO HIGHER 

13768
07:50:23,895 --> 07:50:24,262
GROUND. 

13769
07:50:24,262 --> 07:50:24,695
FAMILY WAS WAITING. 

13770
07:50:24,695 --> 07:50:26,064
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM. 

13771
07:50:26,064 --> 07:50:27,565
SO THE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE 

13772
07:50:27,565 --> 07:50:27,865
COMING OUT. 

13773
07:50:27,865 --> 07:50:28,733
BUT THE BIG THING THAT PEOPLE 

13774
07:50:28,733 --> 07:50:30,135
WANT TO SEE HE, THEY WANT TO 

13775
07:50:30,135 --> 07:50:32,037
SEE THE POWER CREWS. 

13776
07:50:32,037 --> 07:50:34,072
THEY WANT TO SEE THOSE ORANGE 

13777
07:50:34,072 --> 07:50:35,974
FLASHING LIGHTS, AND THOSE 

13778
07:50:35,974 --> 07:50:37,609
CHERRY PICKERS, BECAUSE THAT 

13779
07:50:37,609 --> 07:50:40,045
MEANS PROGRESS, THAT MEANS SOON 

13780
07:50:40,045 --> 07:50:40,679
HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL HAVE 

13781
07:50:40,679 --> 07:50:41,012
ELECTRICITY. 

13782
07:50:41,012 --> 07:50:42,113
>> OMAR, HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE 

13783
07:50:42,113 --> 07:50:43,348
TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW 

13784
07:50:43,348 --> 07:50:44,548
THIS STORM COMPARES TO OTHERS 

13785
07:50:44,548 --> 07:50:45,884
THAT MIGHT HAVE HIT THE AREA? 

13786
07:50:45,884 --> 07:50:47,218
>> Reporter: THERE ARE SOME 

13787
07:50:47,218 --> 07:50:48,553
PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY REALLY 

13788
07:50:48,553 --> 07:50:49,754
COULDN'T COMPARE IT. 

13789
07:50:49,754 --> 07:50:52,991
THERE WAS HERMINE A FEW YEARS 

13790
07:50:52,991 --> 07:50:53,892
AGO IN 2016. 

13791
07:50:53,892 --> 07:50:56,560
THERE WAS A RAIN EVENT, AND IT 

13792
07:50:56,560 --> 07:50:59,164
KIND OF PERKED PEOPLE'S EARS 

13793
07:50:59,164 --> 07:50:59,497
UP. 

13794
07:50:59,497 --> 07:51:02,100
TO HAVE A CATEGORY 4 JUST 

13795
07:51:02,100 --> 07:51:02,834
BARRELING TOWARDS THE 

13796
07:51:02,834 --> 07:51:03,768
PENINSULA, IT HAS BEEN DECADES 

13797
07:51:03,768 --> 07:51:04,401
SINCE ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAS 

13798
07:51:04,401 --> 07:51:07,105
BEEN THOUGHT OF IN THE AREA. 

13799
07:51:07,105 --> 07:51:09,107
FOR SOME REASON, IT ALSO TURNS 

13800
07:51:09,107 --> 07:51:09,307
OFF. 

13801
07:51:09,307 --> 07:51:11,543
IT MAYBE HEADS TO THE BIG BEND 

13802
07:51:11,543 --> 07:51:12,076
AREA NEAR TALLAHASSEE. 

13803
07:51:12,076 --> 07:51:13,611
BUT FOR PEOPLE IN THIS AREA, 

13804
07:51:13,611 --> 07:51:16,481
PEOPLE WERE LISTENING. 

13805
07:51:16,481 --> 07:51:18,816
A LOT OF PEOPLE EVACUATED. 

13806
07:51:18,816 --> 07:51:20,351
THEY WENT FARTHER INLAND. 

13807
07:51:20,351 --> 07:51:22,187
IN PORT ST. JOE, THERE'S ABOUT 

13808
07:51:22,187 --> 07:51:24,122
3500 PEOPLE, AND THE SHERIFF'S 

13809
07:51:24,122 --> 07:51:25,523
DEPARTMENT WAS TELLING US ABOUT 

13810
07:51:25,523 --> 07:51:26,191
60% STAYED. 

13811
07:51:26,191 --> 07:51:28,460
THEY STAYED IN THE AREA AND 

13812
07:51:28,460 --> 07:51:30,061
DECIDED TO RIDE IT OUT AND 

13813
07:51:30,061 --> 07:51:31,129
WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF THOSE 

13814
07:51:31,129 --> 07:51:32,464
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME BACK. 

13815
07:51:32,464 --> 07:51:34,199
THEY'RE COMING TO CHECK ON 

13816
07:51:34,199 --> 07:51:35,367
THEIR PROPERTY. 

13817
07:51:35,367 --> 07:51:36,768
THEY'RE COMING TO CHECK ON 

13818
07:51:36,768 --> 07:51:38,236
THEIR BUSINESSES, AND THEY'RE 

13819
07:51:38,236 --> 07:51:40,105
HAVING TO DO THAT FIRST 

13820
07:51:40,105 --> 07:51:41,106
ASSESSMENT, WHICH SOMETIMES CAN 

13821
07:51:41,106 --> 07:51:41,439
BE SHOCKING. 

13822
07:51:41,439 --> 07:51:42,807
>> OMAR, YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE 

13823
07:51:42,807 --> 07:51:44,275
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THOSE POWER 

13824
07:51:44,275 --> 07:51:44,776
CREWS. 

13825
07:51:44,776 --> 07:51:46,111
WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE 

13826
07:51:46,111 --> 07:51:47,345
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE FOR 

13827
07:51:47,345 --> 07:51:49,648
PEOPLE AS THEY ATTEMPT TO TRY 

13828
07:51:49,648 --> 07:51:49,948
TO RECOVER? 

13829
07:51:49,948 --> 07:51:51,349
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S IN THE VERY 

13830
07:51:51,349 --> 07:51:51,983
EARLY STAGES. 

13831
07:51:51,983 --> 07:51:52,751
I'M WONDERING, YOU KNOW, YOU 

13832
07:51:52,751 --> 07:51:53,484
DON'T HAVE POWER. 

13833
07:51:53,484 --> 07:51:58,022
YOU DON'T HAVE AIR 

13834
07:51:58,022 --> 07:51:58,355
CONDITIONING. 

13835
07:51:58,355 --> 07:51:58,923
I IMAGINE IT'S PRETTY WARM. 

13836
07:51:58,923 --> 07:52:00,357
>> Reporter: IT IS. 

13837
07:52:00,357 --> 07:52:02,327
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE 

13838
07:52:02,327 --> 07:52:03,161
GOOD PREPPERS, AND THEY HAVE 

13839
07:52:03,161 --> 07:52:04,128
GENERATORS READY TO GO. 

13840
07:52:04,128 --> 07:52:06,197
THEY WERE PART OF THAT CREW WHO 

13841
07:52:06,197 --> 07:52:09,534
WAS WAITING IN LINE AT A GAS 

13842
07:52:09,534 --> 07:52:11,802
STATION TO FILL UP GAS TANKS. 

13843
07:52:11,802 --> 07:52:14,339
THEY WERE CHARGING THEIR PHONES 

13844
07:52:14,339 --> 07:52:16,407
AND CARS, BUT THERE'S NO CELL 

13845
07:52:16,407 --> 07:52:17,041
SIGNAL RIGHT NOW. 

13846
07:52:17,041 --> 07:52:18,410
PRETTY MUCH DEAD IN THE AREA. 

13847
07:52:18,410 --> 07:52:20,078
THE BIG CHALLENGE IS GOING TO 

13848
07:52:20,078 --> 07:52:20,945
BE FOR POWER CREWS. 

13849
07:52:20,945 --> 07:52:22,647
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DRIVE 

13850
07:52:22,647 --> 07:52:23,180
DOWN ROADS. 

13851
07:52:23,180 --> 07:52:24,382
WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE CHAINSAW 

13852
07:52:24,382 --> 07:52:26,184
CREWS TO START CLEARING SOME OF 

13853
07:52:26,184 --> 07:52:27,552
THE ROADS. 

13854
07:52:27,552 --> 07:52:28,152
VOLUNTEERS HAVE STARTED DOING 

13855
07:52:28,152 --> 07:52:28,486
IT AS WELL. 

13856
07:52:28,486 --> 07:52:30,355
CLEARING SOME OF THOSE ROADS. 

13857
07:52:30,355 --> 07:52:31,389
MOVING THE DEBRIS OFF THOSE 

13858
07:52:31,389 --> 07:52:33,024
ROADS, SO THE POWER CREWS CAN 

13859
07:52:33,024 --> 07:52:35,360
GO DOWN, TAKE DOWN THE OLD 

13860
07:52:35,360 --> 07:52:37,495
LINES, OR PICK THEM UP, PUT A 

13861
07:52:37,495 --> 07:52:38,930
NEW POLE UP, AND HOPEFULLY, 

13862
07:52:38,930 --> 07:52:41,666
THEY KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE 

13863
07:52:41,666 --> 07:52:42,367
SEVERAL DAYS, THEY'RE JUST 

13864
07:52:42,367 --> 07:52:45,737
HOPING IT'S NOT SEVERAL WEEKS 

13865
07:52:45,737 --> 07:52:46,237
BEFORE THEY GET POWER. 

13866
07:52:46,237 --> 07:52:47,639
>> OMAR VILLAFRANCA FOR US. 

13867
07:52:47,639 --> 07:52:48,039
THANK YOU.

13868
07:52:48,039 --> 07:52:49,341
>>> COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK, 

13869
07:52:49,341 --> 07:52:52,243
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE 

13870
07:52:52,243 --> 07:52:53,311
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SEEKING 

13871
07:52:53,311 --> 07:52:54,779
SHELTER DUE TO HURRICANE 

13872
07:52:54,779 --> 07:52:55,046
MICHAEL. 

13873
07:52:55,046 --> 07:52:56,414
THE MOST POWERFUL STORM TO HIT 

13874
07:52:56,414 --> 07:52:59,050
THE U.S. MAINLAND IN NEARLY 50 

13875
07:52:59,050 --> 07:52:59,283
YEARS. 

13876
07:52:59,283 --> 07:53:01,586
PLUS, LAWMAKERS ARE CALLING FOR 

13877
07:53:01,586 --> 07:53:02,287
ANSWERS ABOUT A SAUDI 

13878
07:53:02,287 --> 07:53:03,154
JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN MISSING 

13879
07:53:03,154 --> 07:53:04,689
FOR MORE THAN A WEEK. 

13880
07:53:04,689 --> 07:53:06,191
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE'S 

13881
07:53:06,191 --> 07:53:07,691
LOOKING INTO WHAT HAPPENED. 

13882
07:53:07,691 --> 07:53:08,058
THIS IS CBSN. 

13883
07:53:08,058 --> 07:53:09,227
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 

13884
07:55:31,836 --> 07:55:33,705
>>> THE DOW JONES PLUNGED MORE 

13885
07:55:33,705 --> 07:55:35,640
THAN 800 POINTS WEDNESDAY. 

13886
07:55:35,640 --> 07:55:38,776
WHILE THE S & P SANK MORE THAN 

13887
07:55:38,776 --> 07:55:39,076
90 POINTS. 

13888
07:55:39,076 --> 07:55:41,045
TECH COMPANIES SAW THE SHARPEST 

13889
07:55:41,045 --> 07:55:44,949
LOSSES AS ANALYSTS SAY 

13890
07:55:44,949 --> 07:55:46,083
INVESTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT 

13891
07:55:46,083 --> 07:55:47,985
RISING INTEREST RATES. 

13892
07:55:47,985 --> 07:55:50,588
THE LONDONEN BUREAU CHIEF FOR 

13893
07:55:50,588 --> 07:55:53,624
THE STREET.COM JOINS ME NOW. 

13894
07:55:53,624 --> 07:55:54,358
THANKS FOR BEING HERE. 

13895
07:55:54,358 --> 07:55:54,791
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 

13896
07:55:54,791 --> 07:55:58,196
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE 

13897
07:55:58,196 --> 07:56:00,265
SUCH A SHARP DROP TODAY? 

13898
07:56:00,265 --> 07:56:01,566
>> I REALLY WAS. 

13899
07:56:01,566 --> 07:56:02,600
AN ORDINARY DAY, THE LOSSES 

13900
07:56:02,600 --> 07:56:04,902
BEGAN TO MOUNT, AND SUDDENLY 

13901
07:56:04,902 --> 07:56:06,504
BEGAN TO ESCALATE, AND TUMBLE, 

13902
07:56:06,504 --> 07:56:08,940
AND WE SAW THE SHARP DECLINES 

13903
07:56:08,940 --> 07:56:09,741
WE DID TODAY. 

13904
07:56:09,741 --> 07:56:12,810
THE NASDAQ HAD ITS WORST DAY IN 

13905
07:56:12,810 --> 07:56:14,578
SEVEN YEARS TODAY. 

13906
07:56:14,578 --> 07:56:15,112
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING. 

13907
07:56:15,112 --> 07:56:17,615
>> WHY DID SOME TECH STOCKS 

13908
07:56:17,615 --> 07:56:19,050
SUFFER SUCH BIG HITS? 

13909
07:56:19,050 --> 07:56:20,385
>> THEY'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO 

13910
07:56:20,385 --> 07:56:21,019
RISING INTEREST RATES, BECAUSE 

13911
07:56:21,019 --> 07:56:23,521
THEY DO CARRY A LOT OF DEBT AS 

13912
07:56:23,521 --> 07:56:26,190
THEY EXPAND THEIR BUSINESSES. 

13913
07:56:26,190 --> 07:56:26,958
THE MORE PRESSURED THEIR 

13914
07:56:26,958 --> 07:56:28,159
PROFITS BECOME, AND INVESTORS 

13915
07:56:28,159 --> 07:56:30,895
WILL TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY OUT 

13916
07:56:30,895 --> 07:56:32,596
OF THE ACCOUNT. 

13917
07:56:32,596 --> 07:56:33,765
THE TECH HAS LED THE GAINS FOR 

13918
07:56:33,765 --> 07:56:34,799
MOST OF THE YEARS. 

13919
07:56:34,799 --> 07:56:36,467
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT 

13920
07:56:36,467 --> 07:56:42,473
TAKING AS WE HEAD INTO THE 

13921
07:56:42,473 --> 07:56:43,274
FINAL MONTHS. 

13922
07:56:43,274 --> 07:56:45,710
IF YOU'RE AN INVEST, MAYBE JUST 

13923
07:56:45,710 --> 07:56:46,711
SIT IT OUT UNTIL CHRISTMAS AND 

13924
07:56:46,711 --> 07:56:47,245
SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 

13925
07:56:47,245 --> 07:56:49,514
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS 

13926
07:56:49,514 --> 07:56:50,180
THAT HELPED THE SELL-OFF. 

13927
07:56:50,180 --> 07:56:51,249
>> THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IT 

13928
07:56:51,249 --> 07:56:52,450
TODAY WHEN HE WAS CRITICAL OF 

13929
07:56:52,450 --> 07:56:53,885
THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THEIR 

13930
07:56:53,885 --> 07:56:54,919
INTEREST RATE POLICY. 

13931
07:56:54,919 --> 07:56:56,354
HE THINKS THEY'RE MOVING A 

13932
07:56:56,354 --> 07:56:56,754
LITTLE TOO FAST. 

13933
07:56:56,754 --> 07:56:59,757
THERE ARE SOME WHO AGREE. 

13934
07:56:59,757 --> 07:57:00,658
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS RUNNING AT 

13935
07:57:00,658 --> 07:57:03,628
THE FATEST PACE IN MORE THAN 

13936
07:57:03,628 --> 07:57:05,396
FIVE YEARS, IT'S PROBABLY GOING 

13937
07:57:05,396 --> 07:57:08,332
TO CONTINUE THAT INTO THE NEXT. 

13938
07:57:08,332 --> 07:57:09,934
WE'RE EARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE 

13939
07:57:09,934 --> 07:57:10,935
EVERY WEEK. 

13940
07:57:10,935 --> 07:57:11,368
INFLATION IS TAME. 

13941
07:57:11,368 --> 07:57:12,670
THE FED IS MOVING MAYBE A 

13942
07:57:12,670 --> 07:57:14,472
LITTLE MORE QUICKLY FOR SOME, 

13943
07:57:14,472 --> 07:57:15,707
AND MAYBE NOT AS QUICK FOR 

13944
07:57:15,707 --> 07:57:17,208
OTHERS, BECAUSE THEY LOOK BACK 

13945
07:57:17,208 --> 07:57:18,042
AT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND 

13946
07:57:18,042 --> 07:57:19,977
THINK THE FED WAS A LITTLE SLOW 

13947
07:57:19,977 --> 07:57:21,746
BACK THEN, AND LOOK WHAT 

13948
07:57:21,746 --> 07:57:22,013
HAPPENED. 

13949
07:57:22,013 --> 07:57:24,315
>> THE DOW IS STILL AT RECORD 

13950
07:57:24,315 --> 07:57:24,549
LEVELS. 

13951
07:57:24,549 --> 07:57:30,688
OVERALL, IS THIS JUST A BLIP? 

13952
07:57:30,688 --> 07:57:31,723
IS THIS JUST A MOMENTARIY BLIP 

13953
07:57:31,723 --> 07:57:33,957
ON THE RADAR SCREEN IN. 

13954
07:57:33,957 --> 07:57:36,194
>> I THINK IT'S STILL DOING 

13955
07:57:36,194 --> 07:57:36,561
TERRIBLY WELL. 

13956
07:57:36,561 --> 07:57:40,698
AGAIN, ONE OF THE BEST PACES IN 

13957
07:57:40,698 --> 07:57:40,998
FIVE YEARS. 

13958
07:57:40,998 --> 07:57:43,034
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE 

13959
07:57:43,034 --> 07:57:44,969
CORPORATE PROFITS RISE IN THIS 

13960
07:57:44,969 --> 07:57:46,070
QUARTER AROUND 20%. 

13961
07:57:46,070 --> 07:57:46,703
THAT'S REALLY HEALTHY EARNINGS, 

13962
07:57:46,703 --> 07:57:47,471
AND ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE 

13963
07:57:47,471 --> 07:57:49,273
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 

13964
07:57:49,273 --> 07:57:49,540
DOING. 

13965
07:57:49,540 --> 07:57:50,742
WHAT INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED 

13966
07:57:50,742 --> 07:57:52,376
ABOUT, IS WHAT HAPPENS IN 2019, 

13967
07:57:52,376 --> 07:57:54,445
WHEN THE IMPACT OF TAX CUTS 

13968
07:57:54,445 --> 07:57:57,448
STARTS TO FADE AWAY, AND THE 

13969
07:57:57,448 --> 07:57:59,517
FEDERAL RESERVE BEGINS TO HIKE 

13970
07:57:59,517 --> 07:58:00,117
INTEREST RATES, AND PROBABLY 

13971
07:58:00,117 --> 07:58:03,554
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IS GOING 

13972
07:58:03,554 --> 07:58:04,855
TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE ONGOING 

13973
07:58:04,855 --> 07:58:05,590
TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN 

13974
07:58:05,590 --> 07:58:08,726
WASHINGTON AND BEIJING.

IMPACT CONSUMER PRODUCTS. 

13979
07:58:20,504 --> 07:58:21,605

EFFECT INTO STOCKS AND 

13981
07:58:22,907 --> 07:58:23,307
EVERYTHING ELSE. 

13982
07:58:23,307 --> 07:58:24,842
WE MAY NOT KNOW THE TRUE STORY 

13983
07:58:24,842 --> 07:58:26,044
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW, BUT 

13984
07:58:26,044 --> 07:58:29,881
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE FIRST 

13985
07:58:29,881 --> 07:58:30,248
WARNING SIGNS. 

13986
07:58:30,248 --> 07:58:32,116

13987
07:58:32,116 --> 07:58:33,251

13988
07:58:33,251 --> 07:58:33,518
JUST SEEN? 

13989

13990
07:58:34,618 --> 07:58:36,988

13991
07:58:36,988 --> 07:58:38,322
FASCINATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS 

13992
07:58:38,322 --> 07:58:39,690
OVERNIGHT IN THE ASIAN MARKETS. 

13993
07:58:39,690 --> 07:58:40,958
CHINA HAS WOBBLED FOR THE LAST 

13994
07:58:40,958 --> 07:58:43,494
FEW WEEKS AS A RESULT OF THE 

13995
07:58:43,494 --> 07:58:43,794
TRADE WAR. 

13996
07:58:43,794 --> 07:58:45,095
IF IT FOLLOWS SUIT FROM WHAT WE 

13997
07:58:45,095 --> 07:58:47,298
SAW ON WALL STREET TODAY, WE 

13998
07:58:47,298 --> 07:58:48,432
COULD SEE MORE SELLING 

13999
07:58:48,432 --> 07:58:49,700
THURSDAY, AND POTENTIALLY INTO 

14000
07:58:49,700 --> 07:58:49,933
FRIDAY. 

14001
07:58:49,933 --> 07:58:54,238
WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN 

14002
07:58:54,238 --> 07:58:55,439
IS WITH THE BANK EARNINGS 

14003
07:58:55,439 --> 07:58:57,008
BEGINNING ON FRIDAY, WE'LL 

14004
07:58:57,008 --> 07:58:58,609
START TO SEE SOME OF THOSE GOOD 

14005
07:58:58,609 --> 07:58:59,310
NUMBERS. 

14006
07:58:59,310 --> 07:59:02,914
A LOT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THE 

14007
07:59:02,914 --> 07:59:04,515
COMPANIES ARE SEEING IN THE 

14008
07:59:04,515 --> 07:59:04,882
MONTHS AHEAD. 

14009
07:59:04,882 --> 07:59:05,750
I STILL THINK THE MARKET IS 

14010
07:59:05,750 --> 07:59:07,351
GOOD UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, 

14011
07:59:07,351 --> 07:59:10,354
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A HEALTHY 

14012
07:59:10,354 --> 07:59:10,654
CORRECTION. 

14013
07:59:10,654 --> 07:59:11,823
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HURT IT TO 

14014
07:59:11,823 --> 07:59:15,393
TAKE SOME OF THAT STEAM OUT, SO 

14015
07:59:15,393 --> 07:59:18,496
WE CAN MAYBE BE FOCUSED ON 

14016
07:59:18,496 --> 07:59:19,163
UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS, RATHER 

14017
07:59:19,163 --> 07:59:21,999
THAN THE SUGAR HIGH AS SOME 

14018
07:59:21,999 --> 07:59:22,734

14019

CHEAPLY NOW. 

14027
07:59:34,912 --> 07:59:36,147
YOU COULD ACTUALLY MAKE A 

14028
07:59:36,147 --> 07:59:36,580
LITTLE MORE MONEY. 

14029
07:59:36,580 --> 07:59:38,082

14031

WORK AND AS A RESULT, THEY'RE 

14046
08:00:05,109 --> 08:00:07,978
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEND.

08:08:52,902 --> 08:08:54,071
THEY'RE WAITING TO HEAR WHEN 

14326
08:08:54,071 --> 08:08:56,006
IT'S SAFE FOR THEM TO GO HOME, 

14327
08:08:56,006 --> 08:08:58,208
AND MANY ARE HOPING TO HEAR 

14328
08:08:58,208 --> 08:08:59,343
FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO 

14329
08:08:59,343 --> 08:09:03,347
STAYED BEHIND, AND THAT THEY'RE 

14330
08:09:03,347 --> 08:09:03,781
SAFE. 

14331
08:09:03,781 --> 08:09:06,617
>> THAT WAS NICKY BATISTE 

14332
08:09:06,617 --> 08:09:07,383
REPORTING FROM BRISTOL, 

14333
08:09:07,383 --> 08:09:07,650
FLORIDA. 

14334
08:09:07,650 --> 08:09:09,353
>>> COMING UP, THE HEAD OF FEMA 

14335
08:09:09,353 --> 08:09:11,788
ISSUED A STRONG WARNING TO 

14336
08:09:11,788 --> 08:09:13,323
PEOPLE STAYING BEHIND IN 

14337
08:09:13,323 --> 08:09:13,857
EVACUATION ZONES. 

14338
08:09:13,857 --> 08:09:14,925
RIDING OUT HURRICANE MICHAEL 

14339
08:09:14,925 --> 08:09:16,927
WILL PUT OTHERS IN DANGER. 

14340
08:09:16,927 --> 08:09:22,399
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON FEMA'S STORM 

14341
08:09:22,399 --> 08:09:23,267
RESPONSE. 

14342
08:09:23,267 --> 08:09:24,668
PLUS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

14343
08:09:24,668 --> 08:09:25,235
TRASHING DEMOCRATS PUSH OF 

14344
08:09:25,235 --> 08:09:25,636
MEDICARE FOR ALL. 

14345
08:11:55,652 --> 08:11:56,587
>>> WHILE HURRICANE MICHAEL 

14346
08:11:56,587 --> 08:11:57,320
PUMMELED THE SOUTHEASTERN 

14347
08:11:57,320 --> 08:11:58,088
UNITED STATES, THE PRESIDENT 

14348
08:11:58,088 --> 08:12:00,557
KEPT DRY FARTHER NORTH, WHERE 

14349
08:12:00,557 --> 08:12:02,192
HE HELD HIS SECOND OF FOUR 

14350
08:12:02,192 --> 08:12:04,795
RALLIES THIS WEEK. 

14351
08:12:04,795 --> 08:12:05,829
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE IN ERIE, 

14352
08:12:05,829 --> 08:12:07,730
PENNSYLVANIA, AFTER HIS 

14353
08:12:07,730 --> 08:12:08,999
CAMPAIGN STOP FOR MULTIPLE 

14354
08:12:08,999 --> 08:12:10,534
REPUBLICANS AHEAD OF THE 

14355
08:12:10,534 --> 08:12:10,801
MIDTERMS. 

14356
08:12:10,801 --> 08:12:11,935
HE THEN ATTENDED A FUNDRAISER 

14357
08:12:11,935 --> 08:12:13,604
IN THE STATE, IN ANOTHER CORNER 

14358
08:12:13,604 --> 08:12:14,871
OF THE U.S., WE'RE GETTING A 

14359
08:12:14,871 --> 08:12:16,974
LOOK AT THE AFTERMATH OF 

14360
08:12:16,974 --> 08:12:17,975
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

14361
08:12:17,975 --> 08:12:19,610
THIS IS MEXICO BEACH, FLORIDA. 

14362
08:12:19,610 --> 08:12:21,678
THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINED HIS 

14363
08:12:21,678 --> 08:12:23,113
REASONING FOR GOING TO 

14364
08:12:23,113 --> 08:12:24,214
PENNSYLVANIA DESPITE THE 

14365
08:12:24,214 --> 08:12:25,882
DANGEROUS STORM IMPACTING MANY 

14366
08:12:25,882 --> 08:12:26,182
AMERICANS. 

14367
08:12:26,182 --> 08:12:29,519
IN A TWEET WEDNESDAY HE SAID HE 

14368
08:12:29,519 --> 08:12:31,355
DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT THE 

14369
08:12:31,355 --> 08:12:32,355
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ATTENDING. 

14370
08:12:32,355 --> 08:12:34,191
BUT HE MIGHT FACE SOME SCRUTINY 

14371
08:12:34,191 --> 08:12:36,493
FOR HIS DECISIONS. 

14372
08:12:36,493 --> 08:12:39,830
MUCH LIKE THE CRITICISM HE GAVE 

14373
08:12:39,830 --> 08:12:40,897
PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THE 2020 

14374
08:12:40,897 --> 08:12:42,032
ELECTION AFTER HURRICANE SANDY. 

14375
08:12:42,032 --> 08:12:45,369
BACK THEN HE TWEETED ABOUT HOW 

14376
08:12:45,369 --> 08:12:45,936
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNED. 

14377
08:12:45,936 --> 08:12:46,637
QUOTE, WHILE HURRICANE SANDY 

14378
08:12:46,637 --> 08:12:49,406
VICTIMS ACROSS NEW YORK AND NEW 

14379
08:12:49,406 --> 08:12:53,577
JERSEY ARE STILL DECIMATED BY 

14380
08:12:53,577 --> 08:12:54,177
SANDY. 

14381
08:12:54,177 --> 08:12:55,279
DAVE LAWLER JOINS ME NOW FROM 

14382
08:12:55,279 --> 08:12:55,612
WASHINGTON. 

14383
08:12:55,612 --> 08:13:02,619
HE IS THE WORLD NEWS EDITOR OF 

14384
08:13:02,619 --> 08:13:02,852
AXIOS. 

14385
08:13:02,852 --> 08:13:03,954
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE 

14386
08:13:03,954 --> 08:13:05,689
PRESIDENT HOLDING A RALLY IN 

14387
08:13:05,689 --> 08:13:07,224
THE MIDDLE OF A DEVASTATING 

14388
08:13:07,224 --> 08:13:07,724
STORM LIKE THIS? 

14389
08:13:07,724 --> 08:13:10,761
>> THIS IS NOT A VISUAL THAT 

14390
08:13:10,761 --> 08:13:12,529
MANY POLITICIANS WOULD OPT FOR. 

14391
08:13:12,529 --> 08:13:13,430
IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY POLITICAL 

14392
08:13:13,430 --> 08:13:15,264
AT A TIME WHEN HE COULD BE 

14393
08:13:15,264 --> 08:13:17,000
SHOWING HIMSELF TO BE ABOVE 

14394
08:13:17,000 --> 08:13:17,334
POLITICS. 

14395
08:13:17,334 --> 08:13:19,603
I THINK IT'S MORE OF AN OPTICS 

14396
08:13:19,603 --> 08:13:19,836
ISSUE. 

14397
08:13:19,836 --> 08:13:21,938
SAY HIS TEAM IS IN PLACE TO 

14398
08:13:21,938 --> 08:13:23,540
RESPOND TO THIS STORM, AND HE 

14399
08:13:23,540 --> 08:13:25,375
TENDS TO THINK THAT IF YOU GET 

14400
08:13:25,375 --> 08:13:28,478
HIM IN FRONT OF A CROWD GOOD 

14401
08:13:28,478 --> 08:13:29,079
THINGS HAPPEN. 

14402
08:13:29,079 --> 08:13:33,650
SO HE HAS A DIFFERENT POLITICAL 

14403
08:13:33,650 --> 08:13:36,620
CALCULOUS THAN OTHER 

14404
08:13:36,620 --> 08:13:37,320
POLITICIANS DO? 

14405
08:13:37,320 --> 08:13:39,723
>> WHAT ABOUT FLORIDA GOVERNOR 

14406
08:13:39,723 --> 08:13:41,258
RICK SCOTT. 

14407
08:13:41,258 --> 08:13:43,393
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS 

14408
08:13:43,393 --> 08:13:44,728
VARIOUS APPEARANCES AHEAD OF 

14409
08:13:44,728 --> 08:13:46,863
THIS STORM AS IT WAS 

14410
08:13:46,863 --> 08:13:47,898
APPROACHING THE STATE OF 

14411
08:13:47,898 --> 08:13:48,165
FLORIDA? 

14412
08:13:48,165 --> 08:13:49,299
>> SO TWO OF THE MOST CLOSELY 

14413
08:13:49,299 --> 08:13:50,700
WATCHED RACES IN THE COUNTRY 

14414
08:13:50,700 --> 08:13:52,369
RIGHT NOW ARE HAPPENING IN 

14415
08:13:52,369 --> 08:13:52,636
FLORIDA. 

14416
08:13:52,636 --> 08:13:54,171
YOU'VE GOT RICK SCOTT, WHO IS 

14417
08:13:54,171 --> 08:13:55,738
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA. 

14418
08:13:55,738 --> 08:13:57,207
HE'S BEEN ON TV ALMOST 

14419
08:13:57,207 --> 08:13:58,608
CONSTANTLY THE LAST FEW DAYS, 

14420
08:13:58,608 --> 08:13:59,943
GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT THIS 

14421
08:13:59,943 --> 08:14:01,077
HURRICANE AND WHAT PEOPLE NEED 

14422
08:14:01,077 --> 08:14:03,713
TO DO TO PREPARE FOR IT. 

14423
08:14:03,713 --> 08:14:06,283
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE RACE TO 

14424
08:14:06,283 --> 08:14:07,484
REPLACE RICK SCOTT HAS 

14425
08:14:07,484 --> 08:14:10,020
GOVERNOR, AND ANDREW GILLUM WHO 

14426
08:14:10,020 --> 08:14:10,654
IS THE MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE, 

14427
08:14:10,654 --> 08:14:12,956
WHICH IS IN THE PATH OF THIS 

14428
08:14:12,956 --> 08:14:15,325
STORM, HAS ALSO BEEN ON TV 

14429
08:14:15,325 --> 08:14:17,227
QUITE A BIT, TALKING ABOUT HIS 

14430
08:14:17,227 --> 08:14:21,731
PLANS TO RESPOND TO THE  STORM. 

14431
08:14:21,731 --> 08:14:24,034
YOU'VE GOT A REPUBLICAN IN ONE 

14432
08:14:24,034 --> 08:14:25,402
RACE ON TV. 

14433
08:14:25,402 --> 08:14:26,870
AND A DEMOCRAT IN ANOTHER RACE 

14434
08:14:26,870 --> 08:14:27,103
ON TV. 

14435
08:14:27,103 --> 08:14:31,308
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH 

14436
08:14:31,308 --> 08:14:34,945
OF THEM TO SHOW STRENGTH. 

14437
08:14:34,945 --> 08:14:36,780
>> IT'S INEXTRICABLY LINKED. 

14438
08:14:36,780 --> 08:14:37,580
THE PRESIDENT HAS ATTACKED 

14439
08:14:37,580 --> 08:14:38,648
DEMOCRATS' PLANS FOR 

14440
08:14:38,648 --> 08:14:38,981
HEALTHCARE. 

14441
08:14:38,981 --> 08:14:40,817
HE DID THIS WEDNESDAY IN A RARE 

14442
08:14:40,817 --> 08:14:42,119
OP-ED FOR U.S.A. 

14443
08:14:42,119 --> 08:14:42,352
TODAY. 

14444
08:14:42,352 --> 08:14:44,420
HE GOES ON TO PLEAD WITH VOTERS 

14445
08:14:44,420 --> 08:14:46,790
TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR 

14446
08:14:46,790 --> 08:14:47,123
REPUBLICANS. 

14447
08:14:47,123 --> 08:14:48,125
SAYING QUOTE, IF DEMOCRATS WIN 

14448
08:14:48,125 --> 08:14:51,662
CONTROL OF CONGRESS THIS 

14449
08:14:51,662 --> 08:14:53,230
NOVEMBER, WE WILL COME 

14450
08:14:53,230 --> 08:14:55,232
DANGEROUSLY CLOSER TO SOCIALISM 

14451
08:14:55,232 --> 08:14:55,732
IN AMERICA. 

14452
08:14:55,732 --> 08:14:57,067
HOW TYPICAL IS THAT RHETORIC 

14453
08:14:57,067 --> 08:14:59,102
FROM A PRESIDENT JUST WEEKS 

14454
08:14:59,102 --> 08:15:00,070
AWAY FROM THE MIDTERMS? 

14455
08:15:00,070 --> 08:15:02,506
>> ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT THIS 

14456
08:15:02,506 --> 08:15:11,415
OP-ED IS IT REALLY DOESN'T 

14457
08:15:11,415 --> 08:15:13,617
STAND UP TO SCRUTINY FROM A 

14458
08:15:13,617 --> 08:15:13,984
FACTUAL STANCE. 

14459
08:15:13,984 --> 08:15:15,419
THE FACTS ON THE DEMOCRATS' 

14460
08:15:15,419 --> 08:15:17,788
PLANS FOR HEALTHCARE ARE NOT, 

14461
08:15:17,788 --> 08:15:20,056
YOU KNOW UP TO SNUFF. 

14462
08:15:20,056 --> 08:15:20,690
WHAT'S INTERESTING THOUGH, IS 

14463
08:15:20,690 --> 08:15:22,259
HEALTHCARE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 

14464
08:15:22,259 --> 08:15:23,860
THE ADS ACROSS ALL THE MIDTERM 

14465
08:15:23,860 --> 08:15:25,095
RACES IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, 

14466
08:15:25,095 --> 08:15:26,696
HEALTHCARE IS THE NUMBER 1 

14467
08:15:26,696 --> 08:15:28,899
ISSUE THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING 

14468
08:15:28,899 --> 08:15:29,766
ABOUT IN THEIR ADS. 

14469
08:15:29,766 --> 08:15:30,733
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT. 

14470
08:15:30,733 --> 08:15:31,401
REPUBLICANS ARE ON THE 

14471
08:15:31,401 --> 08:15:32,335
DEFENSIVE A LITTLE BIT. 

14472
08:15:32,335 --> 08:15:33,737
THEY MIGHT THINK THIS IS A 

14473
08:15:33,737 --> 08:15:35,739
BETTER ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS. 

14474
08:15:35,739 --> 08:15:37,474
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLEARLY 

14475
08:15:37,474 --> 08:15:38,775
SEEING THAT, AND GETTING HIS 

14476
08:15:38,775 --> 08:15:39,108
MESSAGE OUT. 

14477
08:15:39,108 --> 08:15:42,546
IT IS A RARE THING FOR HIM TO 

14478
08:15:42,546 --> 08:15:43,980
WRITE AN OP-ED. 

14479
08:15:43,980 --> 08:15:45,415
>> SO THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING 

14480
08:15:45,415 --> 08:15:49,586
MULTIPLE RALLIES THIS WEEK. 

14481
08:15:49,586 --> 08:15:52,823
ON TUESDAY, HE WAS INCOUNCIL 

14482
08:15:52,823 --> 08:15:53,156
BLUFFS, IOWA. 

14483
08:15:53,156 --> 08:15:53,790
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID. 

14484
08:15:53,790 --> 08:15:56,493
>> A VOTE FOR US IS A VOTE FOR 

14485
08:15:56,493 --> 08:15:57,093
LESS REGULATION AND MORE 

14486
08:15:57,093 --> 08:15:57,861
PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE RIGHT 

14487
08:15:57,861 --> 08:16:00,997
HERE IN THE U.S.A. 

14488
08:16:00,997 --> 08:16:03,132
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 

14489
08:16:03,132 --> 08:16:08,972
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE 

14490
08:16:08,972 --> 08:16:09,472
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 

14491
08:16:09,472 --> 08:16:14,077
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 

14492
08:16:14,077 --> 08:16:14,311
AGAIN. 

14493
08:16:14,311 --> 08:16:20,150
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 

14494
08:16:20,150 --> 08:16:20,383
AGAIN. 

14495
08:16:20,383 --> 08:16:21,985
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 

14496
08:16:21,985 --> 08:16:22,218
AGAIN. 

14497
08:16:22,218 --> 08:16:23,787
>> ALL RIGHT, SO THE 

14498
08:16:23,787 --> 08:16:24,821
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE THERE SEEMS 

14499
08:16:24,821 --> 08:16:28,959
TO BE PRETTY CLEAR, THAT IF YOU 

14500
08:16:28,959 --> 08:16:29,793
VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS, THEY WILL 

14501
08:16:29,793 --> 08:16:48,178
HELP ME IN WASHINGTON. 

14502
08:16:48,178 --> 08:16:49,212
DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE? 

14503
08:16:49,212 --> 08:16:50,013
>> TRUMP BOOSTING THAT 

14504
08:16:50,013 --> 08:16:51,615
ENTHUSIASM GAP WITH DEMOCRATS 

14505
08:16:51,615 --> 08:16:52,582
IS A GOOD THING. 

14506
08:16:52,582 --> 08:16:53,649
THEN AGAIN, TRUMP IS NOT THE 

14507
08:16:53,649 --> 08:16:56,553
MOST POPULAR PRESIDENT IN THE 

14508
08:16:56,553 --> 08:16:56,786
WORLD. 

14509
08:16:56,786 --> 08:16:57,520
THEY THINK HIS APPROVAL RATING 

14510
08:16:57,520 --> 08:16:58,554
IS AT 43% RIGHT NOW. 

14511
08:16:58,554 --> 08:16:59,956
IF YOU'RE RUNNING IN A DISTRICT 

14512
08:16:59,956 --> 08:17:01,657
THAT'S REALLY A TOSS UP. 

14513
08:17:01,657 --> 08:17:02,592
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE THIS 

14514
08:17:02,592 --> 08:17:04,127
RACE MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT 

14515
08:17:04,127 --> 08:17:07,798
YOU THINK ARE GOOD FOR YOU. 

14516
08:17:07,798 --> 08:17:09,099
THE ECONOMY. 

14517
08:17:09,099 --> 08:17:09,432
ABOUT TAXES. 

14518
08:17:09,432 --> 08:17:09,766
THE TAX CUTS. 

14519
08:17:09,766 --> 08:17:11,534
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT PRESIDENT 

14520
08:17:11,534 --> 08:17:15,372
TRUMP COMING TO TOWN AND MAKING 

14521
08:17:15,372 --> 08:17:17,407
THIS ALL ABOUT HIM, AND 

14522
08:17:17,407 --> 08:17:18,308
INJECTING EVEN MORE CONTROVERSY 

14523
08:17:18,308 --> 08:17:19,342
INTO THINGS. 

14524
08:17:19,342 --> 08:17:22,045
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ERIC 

14525
08:17:22,045 --> 08:17:24,748
HOLDER, WHO SAID THIS ON 

14526
08:17:24,748 --> 08:17:25,382
WEDNESDAY. 

14527
08:17:25,382 --> 08:17:26,883
QUOTE, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE 

14528
08:17:26,883 --> 08:17:27,717
KICK THEM. 

14529
08:17:27,717 --> 08:17:31,054
WHICH WAS OF COURSE, A PLAY ON 

14530
08:17:31,054 --> 08:17:32,789
MICHELLE OBAMA'S NOW FAMOUS 

14531
08:17:32,789 --> 08:17:35,625
WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH. 

14532
08:17:35,625 --> 08:17:36,993
THIS WAS FASCINATING TO ME. 

14533
08:17:36,993 --> 08:17:38,494
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORMER 

14534
08:17:38,494 --> 08:17:40,629
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

14535
08:17:40,629 --> 08:17:42,399
SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE TOP LAW 

14536
08:17:42,399 --> 08:17:44,934
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE 

14537
08:17:44,934 --> 08:17:48,038
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SAYING 

14538
08:17:48,038 --> 08:17:48,371
THIS. 

14539
08:17:48,371 --> 08:17:50,307
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT 

14540
08:17:50,307 --> 08:17:52,442
ERIC HOLDER SORT OF TAKING THIS 

14541
08:17:52,442 --> 08:17:54,544
APPROACH AHEAD OF NOVEMBER, AND 

14542
08:17:54,544 --> 08:17:58,548
WHAT DO YOU THINK OTHER 

14543
08:17:58,548 --> 08:17:59,783
DEMOCRATS FEEL ABOUT THAT 

14544
08:17:59,783 --> 08:18:00,216
PARTICULAR TACTIC? 

14545
08:18:00,216 --> 08:18:02,319
>> SO WHEN I SAW THIS QUOTE POP 

14546
08:18:02,319 --> 08:18:04,086
UP IN MY TWITTER FEED, I HAD TO 

14547
08:18:04,086 --> 08:18:06,256
GO AND FIND THE CLIP, BECAUSE I 

14548
08:18:06,256 --> 08:18:07,390
WAS SO SHOCKED BY THE CLIP, I 

14549
08:18:07,390 --> 08:18:08,692
WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WERE 

14550
08:18:08,692 --> 08:18:09,659
GETTING IT RIGHT. 

14551
08:18:09,659 --> 08:18:10,960
THEY WERE GETTING IT RIGHT. 

14552
08:18:10,960 --> 08:18:12,962
ERIC HOLDER DID SAY THIS. 

14553
08:18:12,962 --> 08:18:14,698
THIS COMES AFTER HILLARY 

14554
08:18:14,698 --> 08:18:16,433
CLINTON SAID THAT THE TIME FOR 

14555
08:18:16,433 --> 08:18:17,233
CIVILITY IS OVER. 

14556
08:18:17,233 --> 08:18:19,301
WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE 

14557
08:18:19,301 --> 08:18:20,971
MAJORITIES, AND FIGHT, FIGHT, 

14558
08:18:20,971 --> 08:18:21,204
FIGHT. 

14559
08:18:21,204 --> 08:18:25,141
AND THEN THERE CAN BE TIME FOR 

14560
08:18:25,141 --> 08:18:25,642
CIVILITY. 

14561
08:18:25,642 --> 08:18:26,977
THESE AREN'T PEOPLE COMING FROM 

14562
08:18:26,977 --> 08:18:29,045
THE OUTSIDE SAYING THE 

14563
08:18:29,045 --> 08:18:30,380
ESTABLISHMENT IS DOING IT 

14564
08:18:30,380 --> 08:18:30,613
WRONG. 

14565
08:18:30,613 --> 08:18:32,515
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO 

14566
08:18:32,515 --> 08:18:40,690
IS SAYING THESE THINGS. 

14567
08:18:40,690 --> 08:18:52,068
IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

14568
08:18:52,068 --> 08:18:56,606
IT GUESS IT SHOWS -- IF SO, 

14569
08:18:56,606 --> 08:18:59,075
IT'S GOING TO BE ANEVEN UGLIER 

14570
08:18:59,075 --> 08:19:01,778
POLITICAL CYCLE THAT WHAT WE'VE 

14571
08:19:01,778 --> 08:19:03,179
SEEN SO FAR. 

14572
08:19:03,179 --> 08:19:05,882
>> WHAT ELSE ARE WE SEEING FROM 

14573
08:19:05,882 --> 08:19:06,182
DEMOCRATS? 

14574
08:19:06,182 --> 08:19:08,018
AS WE'VE SEEN REPUBLICANS 

14575
08:19:08,018 --> 08:19:09,519
TRYING TO FIRE UP THEIR SIDE. 

14576
08:19:09,519 --> 08:19:10,453
>> IT VARIES. 

14577
08:19:10,453 --> 08:19:11,454
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE 

14578
08:19:11,454 --> 08:19:14,156
SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRUMP. 

14579
08:19:14,156 --> 08:19:15,258
WE RAN STRICTLY AGAINST TRUMP 

14580
08:19:15,258 --> 08:19:16,693
THE LAST TIME, AND WE LOST. 

14581
08:19:16,693 --> 08:19:18,695
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US. 

14582
08:19:18,695 --> 08:19:21,097
WHAT WE STAND FOR, AND THAT'S A 

14583
08:19:21,097 --> 08:19:22,132
DIFFERENT MESSAGE THAN WHAT 

14584
08:19:22,132 --> 08:19:24,200
WE'RE SEEING FROM PEOPLE. 

14585
08:19:24,200 --> 08:19:25,602
THERE'S ALSO JUST SO MUCH ANGER 

14586
08:19:25,602 --> 08:19:26,102
IN THE BASE. 

14587
08:19:26,102 --> 08:19:27,103
THERE ARE PEOPLE FURIOUS ABOUT 

14588
08:19:27,103 --> 08:19:28,438
WHAT'S HE HAPPENING IN THE 

14589
08:19:28,438 --> 08:19:29,939
COUNTRY AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

14590
08:19:29,939 --> 08:19:30,206
IS DOING. 

14591
08:19:30,206 --> 08:19:30,974
SO PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO 

14592
08:19:30,974 --> 08:19:31,341
THAT AS WELL. 

14593
08:19:31,341 --> 08:19:34,110
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 

14594
08:19:34,110 --> 08:19:34,744
TEST FOR PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY 

14595
08:19:34,744 --> 08:19:37,380
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020. 

14596
08:19:37,380 --> 08:19:39,148
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF 

14597
08:19:39,148 --> 08:19:39,849
THESE PEOPLE WHO RUNS ANGRY. 

14598
08:19:39,849 --> 08:19:43,452
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF 

14599
08:19:43,452 --> 08:19:46,523
THOSE PEOPLE WHO RUNS WITH 

14600
08:19:46,523 --> 08:19:46,756
IDEAS? 

14601
08:19:46,756 --> 08:19:47,657
NOT THAT THOSE ARE MUTUALLY 

14602
08:19:47,657 --> 08:19:51,094
EXCLUSIVE, BUT I THINK THAT'S A 

14603
08:19:51,094 --> 08:19:52,928
DECISION PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO 

14604
08:19:52,928 --> 08:19:53,430
MAKE. 

14605
08:19:53,430 --> 08:19:54,864
>> LET'S TURN TO NIKKI HALEY. 

14606
08:19:54,864 --> 08:19:58,435
SHE ANNOUNCED HER PLANS TO 

14607
08:19:58,435 --> 08:19:58,668
RESIGN. 

14608
08:19:58,668 --> 08:19:59,936
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT HER 

14609
08:19:59,936 --> 08:20:00,236
DEPARTURE. 

14610
08:20:00,236 --> 08:20:01,972
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR 

14611
08:20:01,972 --> 08:20:02,505
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN 

14612
08:20:02,505 --> 08:20:02,739
POLICY? 

14613
08:20:02,739 --> 08:20:06,076
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE'S GOT TO 

14614
08:20:06,076 --> 08:20:07,977
FIND A REPLACEMENT. 

14615
08:20:07,977 --> 08:20:13,950
MY PARTNERS AT AXIOS ARE 

14616
08:20:13,950 --> 08:20:15,685
REPORTING THAT DINA POWEL 

14617
08:20:15,685 --> 08:20:17,620
APPEARS TO BE THE FRONT-RUNNER 

14618
08:20:17,620 --> 08:20:19,956
IF SHE WANTS THE JOB. 

14619
08:20:19,956 --> 08:20:21,491
NIKKI HALEY IS AN INTERESTING 

14620
08:20:21,491 --> 08:20:21,891
CASE. 

14621
08:20:21,891 --> 08:20:23,092
SHE'S ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO 

14622
08:20:23,092 --> 08:20:24,294
SERVED IN IN ADMINISTRATION, 

14623
08:20:24,294 --> 08:20:25,662
AND CAME OUT WITH HER STAR 

14624
08:20:25,662 --> 08:20:28,298
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN WHEN SHE 

14625
08:20:28,298 --> 08:20:30,567
CAME INTO THE ADMINISTRATION. 

14626
08:20:30,567 --> 08:20:36,439
SHE'S SOMEONE WITH NATIONAL 

14627
08:20:36,439 --> 08:20:36,739
AMBITIONS. 

14628
08:20:36,739 --> 08:20:39,776
SHE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON 

14629
08:20:39,776 --> 08:20:41,644
THE BALLOT AT ANY LEVEL IN 

14630
08:20:41,644 --> 08:20:42,078
2020. 

14631
08:20:42,078 --> 08:20:42,611
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE 

14632
08:20:42,611 --> 08:20:42,912
PRESIDENT. 

14633
08:20:42,912 --> 08:20:44,847
>> REALLY FASCINATING TO SEE 

14634
08:20:44,847 --> 08:20:48,918
WHAT SHE WILL DO NEXT. 

14635

DAVID LAWLER. 

14636
08:20:49,251 --> 08:20:51,054

POWERFUL HURRICANES EVER TO HIT 

14663

08:22:04,527 --> 08:22:05,027
CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE. 

14678
08:22:05,027 --> 08:22:06,196
>> IS FEMA STRETCHED THIN? 

14679
08:22:06,196 --> 08:22:10,166
>> YES, YOU START TO REACH A 

14680
08:22:10,166 --> 08:22:11,901
POINT WHERE THE INTERNAL CAPE 

14681
08:22:11,901 --> 08:22:13,469
COUNTY IS TO MANAGE NOT ONLY 

14682
08:22:13,469 --> 08:22:15,672
THE DAY-TO-DAY OF WHAT WE DO, 

14683
08:22:15,672 --> 08:22:17,740
BUT ALSO THE SHEER NUMBER OF 

14684
08:22:17,740 --> 08:22:18,041
DISASTERS. 

14685
08:22:18,041 --> 08:22:18,674
HOW INTENSE THESE DISASTERS 

14686
08:22:18,674 --> 08:22:21,144
HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR 

14687
08:22:21,144 --> 08:22:22,912
AND A HALF. 

14688
08:22:22,912 --> 08:22:24,113
YEAH, IT STARTS TO PUT STRESS 

14689
08:22:24,113 --> 08:22:25,681
INSIDE THE AGENCY. 

14690
08:22:25,681 --> 08:22:26,549
>> Reporter: AND THAT IS 

14691
08:22:26,549 --> 08:22:28,284
MAGNIFIED BECAUSE 5 MONTHS INTO 

14692
08:22:28,284 --> 08:22:29,786
THE HURRICANE SEASON, SOME OF 

14693
08:22:29,786 --> 08:22:32,155
THE TOP JOBS AT FEMA HAVE YET 

14694
08:22:32,155 --> 08:22:33,689
TO BE FILLED. 

14695
08:22:33,689 --> 08:22:35,291
TODAY IN A BRIEFING, 

14696
08:22:35,291 --> 08:22:36,526
ADMINISTRATOR LONG EXPRESSED 

14697
08:22:36,526 --> 08:22:37,826
HIS FRUSTRATION THAT HIS DEPUTY 

14698
08:22:37,826 --> 08:22:42,098
HAD YET TO BE CONFIRMED, EVEN 

14699
08:22:42,098 --> 08:22:43,833
THOUGH HE WAS NOMINATED THIS 

14700
08:22:43,833 --> 08:22:45,301
PAST SUMMER. 

14701
08:22:45,301 --> 08:22:45,801
>> ELAINE. 

14702
08:22:45,801 --> 08:22:47,103
>> THANK YOU. 

14703
08:22:47,103 --> 08:22:49,038
>>> AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, 

14704
08:22:49,038 --> 08:22:51,073
HURRICANE MICHAEL HIT THE 

14705
08:22:51,073 --> 08:22:51,808
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY. 

14706
08:22:51,808 --> 08:22:53,343
NEARLY 30 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE 

14707
08:22:53,343 --> 08:22:58,114
SOUTHEAST WILL BE IMPACTED BY 

14708
08:22:58,114 --> 08:22:59,848
THIS TOMORROW. 

14709
08:22:59,848 --> 08:23:00,082
WHICH 

14710
08:23:00,082 --> 08:23:01,650
-- STORM. 

14711
08:23:01,650 --> 08:23:02,652
MARK DEMARIA IS CHIEF OF 

14712
08:23:02,652 --> 08:23:04,487
SCIENCE AT THE NATIONAL 

14713
08:23:04,487 --> 08:23:05,188
HURRICANE CENTER. 

14714
08:23:05,188 --> 08:23:06,455
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM MIAMI. 

14715
08:23:06,455 --> 08:23:07,924
LET'S START WITH THE LATEST ON 

14716
08:23:07,924 --> 08:23:08,191
MICHAEL. 

14717
08:23:08,191 --> 08:23:10,059
WHERE IS IT NOW, AND WHERE IS 

14718
08:23:10,059 --> 08:23:10,593
IT HEADED? 

14719
08:23:10,593 --> 08:23:11,895
>> RIGHT NOW, IT'S MOVED INTO 

14720
08:23:11,895 --> 08:23:12,595
SOUTHWEST GEORGIA, AND IT'S 

14721
08:23:12,595 --> 08:23:14,731
GOING TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE 

14722
08:23:14,731 --> 08:23:15,865
STATE OF GEORGIA, INTO SOUTH 

14723
08:23:15,865 --> 08:23:16,666
CAROLINA, AND NORTH CAROLINA, 

14724
08:23:16,666 --> 08:23:19,002
AND OUT TO SEA. 

14725
08:23:19,002 --> 08:23:20,803
WE'RE ALSO STILL SEEING FROM 

14726
08:23:20,803 --> 08:23:21,170
DOPPLER RADAR. 

14727
08:23:21,170 --> 08:23:21,804
WE'RE STILL SEEING WINDS UP TO 

14728
08:23:21,804 --> 08:23:23,439
100 MILES PER HOUR IN THE SMALL 

14729
08:23:23,439 --> 08:23:25,074
AREA NEAR THE CORE. 

14730
08:23:25,074 --> 08:23:26,676
SO MICHAEL IS NOT DONE YET. 

14731
08:23:26,676 --> 08:23:29,678
>> WHAT IS THE BIGGEST THREAT 

14732
08:23:29,678 --> 08:23:30,746
THEN GOING FORWARD? 

14733
08:23:30,746 --> 08:23:31,881
>> RIGHT NOW, THE THREAT IS 

14734
08:23:31,881 --> 08:23:33,216
STILL GOING TO BE FOR WIND 

14735
08:23:33,216 --> 08:23:35,685
ALONG THE NARROW PATH OF THE 

14736
08:23:35,685 --> 08:23:35,952
CENTER. 

14737
08:23:35,952 --> 08:23:39,289
THIS AREA OF GEORGIA IS HEAVILY 

14738
08:23:39,289 --> 08:23:39,522
WOODED. 

14739
08:23:39,522 --> 08:23:42,492
DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF WIND TO 

14740
08:23:42,492 --> 08:23:44,994
KNOCK DOWN TREES AND CREATE 

14741
08:23:44,994 --> 08:23:45,361
POWER OUTAGES. 

14742
08:23:45,361 --> 08:23:48,097
WE STILL ANTICIPATE SOME WIND 

14743
08:23:48,097 --> 08:23:49,566
DAMAGE ALONG THE WAY. 

14744
08:23:49,566 --> 08:23:51,501
THAT ALONG WITH RAIN OF 4 TO 6 

14745
08:23:51,501 --> 08:23:52,735
INCHES ALONG THE PATH. 

14746
08:23:52,735 --> 08:23:55,538
>> IS IT UNUSUAL FOR A STORM TO 

14747
08:23:55,538 --> 08:23:57,140
STAY THIS POWERFUL THIS FAR 

14748
08:23:57,140 --> 08:23:57,373
INLAND? 

14749
08:23:57,373 --> 08:23:58,808
>> NO, A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB 

14750
08:23:58,808 --> 08:24:00,777
IS THAT A HURRICANE LOSES ABOUT 

14751
08:24:00,777 --> 08:24:02,545
HALF OF ITS INTENSITY IN TEN 

14752
08:24:02,545 --> 08:24:02,778
HOURS. 

14753
08:24:02,778 --> 08:24:03,379
BECAUSE THIS WENT IN AT 150 

14754
08:24:03,379 --> 08:24:05,314
MILES PER HOUR, IT CAN STAY A 

14755
08:24:05,314 --> 08:24:08,384
HURRICANE FOR UP TO TEN HOURS. 

14756
08:24:08,384 --> 08:24:10,086
AND MOVING PRETTY FAST, THOSE 

14757
08:24:10,086 --> 08:24:11,054
WINDS CAN PENETRATE VERY FAR 

14758
08:24:11,054 --> 08:24:11,287
INLAND. 

14759
08:24:11,287 --> 08:24:14,190
>> SO IT'S NOT OVER YET IS THE 

14760
08:24:14,190 --> 08:24:15,591
BOTTOM LINE. 

14761
08:24:15,591 --> 08:24:17,327
ALL RIGHT, MARK, THANK YOU VERY 

14762
08:24:17,327 --> 08:24:17,527
MUCH. 

14763
08:24:17,527 --> 08:24:17,827
>> WELCOME. 

14764
08:24:17,827 --> 08:24:19,228
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

14765
08:24:19,228 --> 08:24:19,461
BREAK. 

14766
08:24:19,461 --> 08:24:21,698
BEFORE WE DO, WE WANT TO LET 

14767
08:24:21,698 --> 08:24:22,932
YOU KNOW ABOUT AN EXCITING 

14768
08:24:22,932 --> 08:24:24,634
CHANGE COMING TO CBSN. 

14769
08:24:24,634 --> 08:24:25,435
BEGINNING ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 

14770
08:24:25,435 --> 08:24:28,705
15, WE ARE ADDING A NEW HOUR OF 

14771
08:24:28,705 --> 08:24:31,407
LIVE COVERAGE TO OUR LINEUP, 

14772
08:24:31,407 --> 08:24:36,646
BEGINNING AT 7:00 A.M. 

14773
08:24:36,646 --> 08:24:37,346
EASTERN, ANNE-MARIE GREEN, AND 

14774
08:24:37,346 --> 08:24:38,281
VLADIMIR DUTIER WILL BRING YOU 

14775
08:24:38,281 --> 08:24:40,450
THE NEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD 

14776
08:24:40,450 --> 08:24:43,353
WITH OUR GLOBAL TEAM OF 

14777
08:24:43,353 --> 08:24:43,720
CORRESPONDENTS. 

14778
08:24:43,720 --> 08:24:44,987
WE'LL ALSO DIG DEEP INTO THE 

14779
08:24:44,987 --> 08:24:48,123
STORIES THAT MATTER MOST TO 

14780
08:24:48,123 --> 08:24:52,461
YOU, WITH UNBIASED INSIGHTS, 

14781
08:24:52,461 --> 08:24:53,196
AND PERSPECTIVE. 

14782
08:24:53,196 --> 08:24:54,263
DON'T MISS ANNE-MARIE, AND VLAD 

14783
08:24:54,263 --> 08:24:55,231
FOR THE ALL NEW CBSN A.M. 

14784
08:28:30,679 --> 08:28:31,581
>>> AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, 

14785
08:28:31,581 --> 08:28:34,016
PANAMA CITY WAS IN THE DIRECT 

14786
08:28:34,016 --> 08:28:35,150
PATH OF HURRICANE MICHAEL. 

14787
08:28:35,150 --> 08:28:41,023
YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE DAMAGE 

14788
08:28:41,023 --> 08:28:41,456
WINDS DID THERE. 

14789
08:28:41,456 --> 08:28:48,431
ROOFS WERE RIPPED UP, AND TREES 

14790
08:28:48,431 --> 08:28:49,665
WERE BLOWN DOWN. 

14791
08:28:49,665 --> 08:28:51,200
WINDS WERE BLOWING IN ALL 

14792
08:28:51,200 --> 08:28:52,168
DIRECTIONS. 

14793
08:28:52,168 --> 08:28:53,436
HILLARY WHAT WERE THE 

14794
08:28:53,436 --> 08:28:56,238
CONDITIONS WHERE YOU ARE? 

14795
08:28:56,238 --> 08:28:57,339
>> Reporter: ELAINE IT IS 

14796
08:28:57,339 --> 08:28:58,874
LITERALLY THE CALL AFTER THE 

14797
08:28:58,874 --> 08:28:59,108
STORM. 

14798
08:28:59,108 --> 08:29:00,776
IT IS SO DIFFERENT COMPARED TO 

14799
08:29:00,776 --> 08:29:03,079
HOW IT WAS A FEW HOURS AGO. 

14800
08:29:03,079 --> 08:29:03,879
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME 

14801
08:29:03,879 --> 08:29:05,014
OUTSIDE DURING THE HEIGHT OF 

14802
08:29:05,014 --> 08:29:06,115
THE STORM, BECAUSE IT JUST 

14803
08:29:06,115 --> 08:29:07,750
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DANGEROUS. 

14804
08:29:07,750 --> 08:29:09,318
SO WE WATCHED FROM OUR HOTEL 

14805
08:29:09,318 --> 08:29:10,720
ROOM AS THE WINDS SNAPPED 

14806
08:29:10,720 --> 08:29:13,789
ACROSS THE AREA. 

14807
08:29:13,789 --> 08:29:15,291
THEY TOOK TONS OF PALM TREES 

14808
08:29:15,291 --> 08:29:15,591
DOWN. 

14809
08:29:15,591 --> 08:29:16,792
MANY SIGNS, AND COMPLETELY ON 

14810
08:29:16,792 --> 08:29:18,661
THE GROUND, AND WIRES AS WELL. 

14811
08:29:18,661 --> 08:29:22,264
TAKING POWER OUT ALL OVER THE 

14812
08:29:22,264 --> 08:29:24,433
AREA, AND WATER, THE RAIN JUST 

14813
08:29:24,433 --> 08:29:25,834
COMING DOWN IN BUCKETS. 

14814
08:29:25,834 --> 08:29:28,404
>> SO THERE'S NO POWER WHERE 

14815
08:29:28,404 --> 08:29:29,472
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? 

14816
08:29:29,472 --> 08:29:31,072
>> Reporter: THAT'S CORRECT. 

14817
08:29:31,072 --> 08:29:32,742
CLOSE TO 200,000 PEOPLE IN THIS 

14818
08:29:32,742 --> 08:29:35,110
AREA ARE WITHOUT POWER. 

14819
08:29:35,110 --> 08:29:36,212
WE LOST POWER ACTUALLY BEFORE 

14820
08:29:36,212 --> 08:29:42,084
THE BRUNT, BEFORE THE EYE CAME 

14821
08:29:42,084 --> 08:29:42,952
THROUGH THIS AREA. 

14822
08:29:42,952 --> 08:29:43,853
THAT'S THE SIMILAR SITUATION 

14823
08:29:43,853 --> 08:29:44,686
FOR MANY PEOPLE. 

14824
08:29:44,686 --> 08:29:47,390
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA HAS 

14825
08:29:47,390 --> 08:29:48,557
SAID THAT RESTORING POWER IS 

14826
08:29:48,557 --> 08:29:49,591
HIS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY. 

14827
08:29:49,591 --> 08:29:51,293
BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, 

14828
08:29:51,293 --> 08:29:52,294
ESPECIALLY AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO 

14829
08:29:52,294 --> 08:29:52,561
REBUILD. 

14830
08:29:52,561 --> 08:29:55,831
>> HILLARY, HAVE YOU SEEN 

14831
08:29:55,831 --> 08:29:58,334
PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT AT ALL,OR 

14832
08:29:58,334 --> 08:29:59,101
FIRST RESPONDERS? 

14833
08:29:59,101 --> 08:30:00,369
>> RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE 

14834
08:30:00,369 --> 08:30:01,771
STARTING TO GET OUT AND SURVEY 

14835
08:30:01,771 --> 08:30:02,071
THE DAMAGE. 

14836
08:30:02,071 --> 08:30:03,939
THIS ROAD HAS BEEN VERY QUIET. 

14837
08:30:03,939 --> 08:30:05,408
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE 

14838
08:30:05,408 --> 08:30:05,974
DRIVE BY. 

14839
08:30:05,974 --> 08:30:07,843
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING DURING 

14840
08:30:07,843 --> 08:30:09,478
THIS STORM, THE GOVERNOR SAID 

14841
08:30:09,478 --> 08:30:10,112
THAT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WILL 

14842
08:30:10,112 --> 08:30:11,647
NOT BE RESCUING PEOPLE, BECAUSE 

14843
08:30:11,647 --> 08:30:13,449
IT WOULD BE PUTTING THEIR LIVES 

14844
08:30:13,449 --> 08:30:15,785
AT RISK. 

14845
08:30:15,785 --> 08:30:17,420
SO NOW WE KNOW THOSE EMERGENCY 

14846
08:30:17,420 --> 08:30:19,355
MANAGEMENT SERVICE GROUPS ARE 

14847
08:30:19,355 --> 08:30:20,256
OUT IN THE COMMUNITY, SURVEYING 

14848
08:30:20,256 --> 08:30:22,024
DAMAGE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT 

14849
08:30:22,024 --> 08:30:23,125
WHAT'S GOING ON. 

14850
08:30:23,125 --> 08:30:24,460
AS WE'RE DOING THAT, WE'RE ALSO 

14851
08:30:24,460 --> 08:30:25,861
NOTICING RESIDENTS ARE COMING 

14852
08:30:25,861 --> 08:30:27,897

TAKEOFF.

15053
08:41:36,598 --> 08:41:36,931

THE CITY MANAGER TELLS US HE

15060
08:41:51,780 --> 08:41:53,514
THINKS ABOUT 50% OF RESIDENTS

15210
08:46:34,095 --> 08:46:38,933
THAT IS HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO

15211
08:46:38,933 --> 08:46:39,534
GET AHOLD OF JEFF.

15212
08:46:39,534 --> 08:46:40,968
YOU CAN SEE OVER HERE THERE IS

15213
08:46:40,968 --> 08:46:42,570
ONE OF THESE BIG TALL, BEAUTIFUL

15214
08:46:42,570 --> 08:46:45,473
PINE TREES THAT ARE OVER HERE IN

15215
08:46:45,473 --> 08:46:46,908
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE.

15216
08:46:46,908 --> 08:46:48,309
PROBLEM IS WHEN A HURRICANE

15217
08:46:48,309 --> 08:46:49,944
COMES IN, THEY SNAP AND THEY ARE

15218
08:46:49,944 --> 08:46:51,780
SO TALL ANY POWER LINE THAT IS

15219
08:46:51,780 --> 08:46:53,647
AROUND IT, THEY ARE BRINGING

15220
08:46:53,647 --> 08:46:54,281
DOWN WITH IT.

15221
08:46:54,281 --> 08:46:56,450
THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES

15222
08:46:56,450 --> 08:46:57,018
AROUND HERE.

15223
08:46:57,018 --> 08:47:03,858
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CHAIN SAWS

15224
08:47:03,858 --> 08:47:05,727
READY TO GO IN THIS

15225
08:47:05,727 --> 08:47:06,194
NEIGHBORHOOD.

15226
08:47:06,194 --> 08:47:07,629
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL GET SOME

15227
08:47:07,629 --> 08:47:08,195
POWER UP.

15228
08:47:08,195 --> 08:47:11,899
THEY UNDERSTAND STAND IT -- IT

15229
08:47:11,899 --> 08:47:12,400
IS

15230
08:47:12,400 --> 08:47:14,069
GOING TO BE A LONG PROCESS FOR

15231
08:47:14,069 --> 08:47:18,473
ELEK

15232
08:47:18,473 --> 08:47:20,575
E -- ELECTRICITY FOR THIS

15233
08:47:20,575 --> 08:47:21,642
PROCESS AND CLEAN UP.

15234
08:47:21,642 --> 08:47:27,282
>> I WANT TO TALK TO LONI, CHIEF

15235
08:47:27,282 --> 08:47:27,882
WEATHER CASTER.

15236
08:47:27,882 --> 08:47:30,318
I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL BEEN AMAZED

15237
08:47:30,318 --> 08:47:31,453
AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

15238
08:47:31,453 --> 08:47:33,321
HURRICANE MICHAEL AND WHAT HAS

15239
08:47:33,321 --> 08:47:33,654
HAPPENED HERE.

15240
08:47:33,654 --> 08:47:35,623
HOW DOES SOMETHING GO FROM A

15241
08:47:35,623 --> 08:47:37,358
TROPICAL STORM TO A NEARLY

15242
08:47:37,358 --> 08:47:43,364
CATEGORY 5 IN THE SPAN OF 72

15243
08:47:43,364 --> 08:47:43,865
HOURS.

15244
08:47:43,865 --> 08:47:45,966
>> IT JUST BUMPED UP SO QUICKLY.

15245
08:47:45,966 --> 08:47:47,501
THERE WERE ELEMENTS OUT THERE

15246
08:47:47,501 --> 08:47:49,971
THAT COULD HAVE BEATEN IT UP A

15247
08:47:49,971 --> 08:47:50,572
LITTLE BIT.

15248
08:47:50,572 --> 08:47:51,139
DID NOT HAPPEN.

15249
08:47:51,139 --> 08:47:52,707
HERE IS YOUR CURRENT SITUATION

15250
08:47:52,707 --> 08:47:53,307
OUT THERE.

15251
08:47:53,307 --> 08:47:54,275
SORRY THIS IS YOUR LANDFALL

15252
08:47:54,275 --> 08:47:54,576
PICTURE.

15253
08:47:54,576 --> 08:47:58,146
YOU SEE HOW MEXICO BEACH TOOK

15254
08:47:58,146 --> 08:47:59,714
THE WORST OF THE EYE WALL.

15255
08:47:59,714 --> 08:48:00,982
PANAMA BEACH OVER TO LAGUNA

15256
08:48:00,982 --> 08:48:01,483
BEACH.

15257
08:48:01,483 --> 08:48:03,151
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EYE WALL

15258
08:48:03,151 --> 08:48:04,886
VERY STRONG BUT PUSHING THE

15259
08:48:04,886 --> 08:48:05,386
WATER OUT AWAY FROM THE

15260
08:48:05,386 --> 08:48:05,653
SHORELINE.

15261
08:48:05,653 --> 08:48:07,488
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE

15262
08:48:07,488 --> 08:48:09,557
ARE DEALING WITH AS OF RIGHT

15263
08:48:09,557 --> 08:48:12,427
NOW, YOU HAVE A STORM THAT IS

15264
08:48:12,427 --> 08:48:12,960
INTO GEORGIA.

15265
08:48:12,960 --> 08:48:14,062
EVERYBODY ASKED THE SAME

15266
08:48:14,062 --> 08:48:16,865
QUESTION THAT JEFF IS ASKING,

15267
08:48:16,865 --> 08:48:17,465
HOW?

15268
08:48:17,465 --> 08:48:18,099
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

15269
08:48:18,099 --> 08:48:19,067
WHAT ELEMENTS CAME TOGETHER?

15270
08:48:19,067 --> 08:48:19,867
WELL HERE IS THE DEAL.

15271
08:48:19,867 --> 08:48:20,935
YOU HAD WARM WATER, NOTHING BUT

15272
08:48:20,935 --> 08:48:22,771
FUEL IN FRONT OF THIS SYSTEM FOR

15273
08:48:22,771 --> 08:48:23,370
IT TO FEED ON.

15274
08:48:23,370 --> 08:48:25,306
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD MAYBE PULL A

15275
08:48:25,306 --> 08:48:26,241
LITTLE BIT OF DRY AIR.

15276
08:48:26,241 --> 08:48:28,476
IT NEVER MIXED IN THAT WAY.

15277
08:48:28,476 --> 08:48:30,711
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

15278
08:48:30,711 --> 08:48:36,551
YOU HAD RAPID INTENSIFICATION.

15279
08:48:36,551 --> 08:48:36,984
IT NEVER INTERACTED.

15280
08:48:36,984 --> 08:48:38,485
IT JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN.

15281
08:48:38,485 --> 08:48:41,589
YOU ENDED UP WITH A NEARLY CAT 5

15282
08:48:41,589 --> 08:48:42,290
LAND FALL.

15283
08:48:42,290 --> 08:48:44,125
THE STRONGEST STORM IN THAT

15284
08:48:44,125 --> 08:48:45,326
AREA, ABOUT THE THIRD STRONGEST

15285
08:48:45,326 --> 08:48:48,963
STORM THE U.S. HAS EVER HAD AS

15286
08:48:48,963 --> 08:48:49,663
FAR AS MAINLAND LANDFALL.

15287
08:48:49,663 --> 08:48:52,801
THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE SEEN SO

15288
08:48:52,801 --> 08:48:53,835
FAR.

15289
08:48:53,835 --> 08:49:00,575
THOSE ARE TOPS OF HOUSES OUT

15290
08:49:00,575 --> 08:49:00,775
THERE.

15291
08:49:00,775 --> 08:49:07,148
LOOK AT ALL THAT DESTRUCTION.

15292
08:49:07,148 --> 08:49:14,089
IT SHOULD BE EXITING SOMEWHERE

15293
08:49:14,089 --> 08:49:17,491
ALONG THE CHESAPEAKE.

15294
08:49:17,491 --> 08:49:19,327
>> THAT'S A CONCERN AS WELL,

15295
08:49:19,327 --> 08:49:19,794
RIGHT?

15296
08:49:19,794 --> 08:49:21,229
>> EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE

15297
08:49:21,229 --> 08:49:22,029
EXACT SAME THING.

15298
08:49:22,029 --> 08:49:23,965
LOOK AT THE FORECASTED RAINFALL

15299
08:49:23,965 --> 08:49:24,566
TOTALS.

15300
08:49:24,566 --> 08:49:26,167
THESE ARE NOT ENORMOUS LIKE WHAT

15301
08:49:26,167 --> 08:49:27,468
THEY PICKED UP EARLIER.

15302
08:49:27,468 --> 08:49:38,113
TO YOU -- SOLE FALL SOME FOLKS

15303
08:49:38,113 --> 08:49:39,714
HAVEN'T EVEN

15304
08:49:39,714 --> 08:49:40,782
DRIED UP YET.

15305
08:49:40,782 --> 08:49:42,150
NEW YORK CITY COULD BE SEEING A

15306
08:49:42,150 --> 08:49:43,650
1 TO 3 INCH RANGE TOMORROW.

15307
08:49:43,650 --> 08:49:44,418
WE HAVE FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS IN

15308
08:49:44,418 --> 08:49:46,087
PLACE FOR THE CITY BECAUSE OF

15309
08:49:46,087 --> 08:49:46,387
THIS STORM.

15310
08:49:46,387 --> 08:49:48,056
IT IS NOT COMING TO NEW YORK

15311
08:49:48,056 --> 08:49:52,127
CITY, STAYS OFFSHORE BUT A LOT

15312
08:49:52,127 --> 08:49:53,127
OF RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

15313
08:49:53,127 --> 08:49:53,494
JEFF.

15314
08:49:53,494 --> 08:49:54,562
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15315
08:49:54,562 --> 08:49:57,265
AGAIN WE WILL CHECK IN NOW WITH

15316
08:49:57,265 --> 08:49:57,632
NICKY.

15317
08:49:57,632 --> 08:49:58,799
SHE IS IN BRISTOL, FLORIDA.

15318
08:49:58,799 --> 08:49:59,900
IT IS ABOUT 60 MILES INLAND

15319
08:49:59,900 --> 08:50:01,903
WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE, HUNDREDS

15320
08:50:01,903 --> 08:50:06,107
OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKE ON FOR

15321
08:50:06,107 --> 08:50:06,608
SHELTER.

15322
08:50:06,608 --> 08:50:09,610
>> THE SURGE IS WHAT SCARED ME.

15323
08:50:09,610 --> 08:50:12,380
>> THESE LIFE-THREATENING STORM

15324
08:50:12,380 --> 08:50:13,580
SURGES IN FRANKLIN COUNTY LED

15325
08:50:13,580 --> 08:50:15,817
DOWN SEEK SHELTER HERE 60 MILES

15326
08:50:15,817 --> 08:50:16,084
AWAY.

15327
08:50:16,084 --> 08:50:18,486
>> IF THE SURGE HITS AS HIGH AS

15328
08:50:18,486 --> 08:50:21,688
THEY THINK, 13 FEET POSSIBLY,

15329
08:50:21,688 --> 08:50:23,724
WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO YOUR

15330
08:50:23,724 --> 08:50:24,392
HOUSE?

15331
08:50:24,392 --> 08:50:31,232
>> IT WOULD PROBABLY BE HALF WAY

15332
08:50:31,232 --> 08:50:32,400
UP THE FIRST FLOOR.

15333
08:50:32,400 --> 08:50:33,902
>> THE MESSAGE HERE IS CLEAR,

15334
08:50:33,902 --> 08:50:36,871
GET OUT NOW OR RISK YOUR LIFE.

15335
08:50:36,871 --> 08:50:39,307
>> WE SOON EVACUATED THE AREA

15336
08:50:39,307 --> 08:50:39,540
TOO.

15337
08:50:39,540 --> 08:50:40,775
WE JUST HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE THE

15338
08:50:40,775 --> 08:50:42,410
STORM IS COMING IN FAST AND

15339
08:50:42,410 --> 08:50:42,643
FURIOUS.

15340
08:50:42,643 --> 08:50:44,145
WE ARE DRIVING ABOUT AN HOUR

15341
08:50:44,145 --> 08:50:45,813
AWAY FROM HERE TO FIND SOME

15342
08:50:45,813 --> 08:50:48,482
SHELTER SO WE CAN STAY SAFE AS

15343
08:50:48,482 --> 08:50:49,517
THIS HURRICANE HITS LAND.

15344
08:50:49,517 --> 08:50:51,685
>> WE WATCHED THE HURRICANE HIT

15345
08:50:51,685 --> 08:50:53,020
FROM THESE WINDOWS.

15346
08:50:53,020 --> 08:50:55,556
IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO STEP

15347
08:50:55,556 --> 08:50:55,957
OUTSIDE.

15348
08:50:55,957 --> 08:50:57,792
OUR TEAM SOUGHT SAFETY WITH MORE

15349
08:50:57,792 --> 08:51:00,728
THAN 200 FLORIDIANS AT THIS

15350
08:51:00,728 --> 08:51:01,562
SCHOOL INLAND.

15351
08:51:01,562 --> 08:51:02,764
>> WHEN THEY SAID IT WAS A

15352
08:51:02,764 --> 08:51:04,932
CATEGORY 3 BECOMING A 4, I SAID

15353
08:51:04,932 --> 08:51:05,399
LETS GO.

15354
08:51:05,399 --> 08:51:07,335
>> SHE SAID A TREE FELL ON HER

15355
08:51:07,335 --> 08:51:10,772
MOBILE HOME AND THE POWER WENT

15356
08:51:10,772 --> 08:51:11,372
OUT.

15357
08:51:11,372 --> 08:51:14,242
THE THOUGHT STILL SCARES HER

15358
08:51:14,242 --> 08:51:15,609
4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DANNY.

15359
08:51:15,609 --> 08:51:16,778
>> I WAS JUST CRYING.

15360
08:51:16,778 --> 08:51:18,880
>> YOU ARE HERE, YOUR FAMILY IS

15361
08:51:18,880 --> 08:51:19,180
SAFE.

15362
08:51:19,180 --> 08:51:24,018
WHAT TO -- DO YOU STAND TO LOSE

15363
08:51:24,018 --> 08:51:24,419
BACK HOME?

15364
08:51:24,419 --> 08:51:30,124
>> NOTHING JUST MATERIAL THINGS

15365
08:51:30,124 --> 08:51:31,024
THAT CAN BE REPLACED.

15366
08:51:31,024 --> 08:51:33,361
>> DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR

15367
08:51:33,361 --> 08:51:34,562
SHELTER ARE THESE DOWNED TREES

15368
08:51:34,562 --> 08:51:35,029
AND POWER LINES.

15369
08:51:35,029 --> 08:51:36,564
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH

15370
08:51:36,564 --> 08:51:38,099
MORE DIFFICULT TO PEOPLE TO GET

15371
08:51:38,099 --> 08:51:43,204
HOME AND TO SEE IF THEIR HOUSES

15372
08:51:43,204 --> 08:51:44,438
ARE STILL STANDING.

15373
08:51:44,438 --> 08:51:44,639
JEFF.

15374
08:51:44,639 --> 08:51:45,306
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.

15375
08:51:45,306 --> 08:51:46,341
A TENSE FRIGHTENING AFTERNOON

15376
08:51:46,341 --> 08:51:49,477
FOR SO MANY PEOPLE HERE IN

15377
08:51:49,477 --> 08:51:50,011
FLORIDA.

15378
08:51:50,011 --> 08:51:51,145
EVEN MORE SO TONIGHT BECAUSE

15379
08:51:51,145 --> 08:51:53,814
CELL SERVICE IS NOT COMING IN.

15380
08:51:53,814 --> 08:51:54,983
WE HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT

15381
08:51:54,983 --> 08:51:57,919
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WILL BE

15382
08:51:57,919 --> 08:52:00,587
VISITING THIS AREA ON EITHER

15383
08:52:00,587 --> 08:52:01,822
SUNDAY OR MONDAY.

15384
08:52:01,822 --> 08:52:04,158
JEFF HAS BEEN WATCHING THE

15385
08:52:04,158 --> 08:52:10,231
FEDERAL RESPONSE ALL DAY AT FEMA

15386
08:52:10,231 --> 08:52:11,833
HEADQUARTERS.

15387
08:52:11,833 --> 08:52:14,768
>> AT FEMA HEADQUARTERS A FEW

15388
08:52:14,768 --> 08:52:15,803
HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE ALREADY

15389
08:52:15,803 --> 08:52:16,837

THE FACTS ON THE -- DEMOCRATS

PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE ARE NOT UP

15753
09:21:34,260 --> 09:21:34,593
TO SNUFF.

15754
09:21:34,593 --> 09:21:35,561
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT

15755
09:21:35,561 --> 09:21:37,429
HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

15756
09:21:37,429 --> 09:21:38,965
ADS ACROSS ALL THE MIDTERM RACES

15757
09:21:38,965 --> 09:21:40,299
IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, HEALTH

15758
09:21:40,299 --> 09:21:41,667
CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

15759
09:21:41,667 --> 09:21:43,536
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

15760
09:21:43,536 --> 09:21:45,204
AND N THEIR ADS.

15761
09:21:45,204 --> 09:21:45,671
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT.

15762
09:21:45,671 --> 09:21:46,772
REPUBLICANS ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE

15763
09:21:46,772 --> 09:21:47,206
A LITTLE BIT.

15764
09:21:47,206 --> 09:21:48,841
THEY MIGHT THINK THIS IS A

15765
09:21:48,841 --> 09:21:54,179
BETTER ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS AND

15766
09:21:54,179 --> 09:21:56,949
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLEARLY

15767
09:21:56,949 --> 09:21:58,017

15768
09:21:58,017 --> 09:21:58,985

09:21:58,985 --> 09:22:06,092
>> THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING

15770
09:22:06,092 --> 09:22:06,659
MULTIPLE RALLIES THIS WEEK.

>> A VOTE FOR US IS A VOTE FOR

15772
09:22:11,697 --> 09:22:13,199
LOWER TAXES, LESS REGULATION AND

15773
09:22:13,199 --> 09:22:15,201
MORE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE

15774
09:22:15,201 --> 09:22:16,969
RIGHT HERE IN THE USA.

15775
09:22:16,969 --> 09:22:19,872
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.

15776
09:22:19,872 --> 09:22:24,243
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE

15777
09:22:24,243 --> 09:22:26,946

15785
09:22:42,094 --> 09:22:44,497
CLEAR THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR

15786
09:22:44,497 --> 09:22:46,465
REPUBLICANS, THEY WILL HELP ME

15787
09:22:46,465 --> 09:22:46,832
IN WASHINGTON.

15788
09:22:46,832 --> 09:22:49,735
TO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW

15789
09:22:49,735 --> 09:22:50,603
AFFECTIVE THAT PARTICULAR

15790
09:22:50,603 --> 09:22:51,103
STRATEGY MIGHT BE?

15791
09:22:51,103 --> 09:22:53,439
>> IT VARIES QUITE A BIT RACE TO

15792
09:22:53,439 --> 09:22:53,639
RACE.

15793
09:22:53,639 --> 09:22:54,740
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THESE

15794
09:22:54,740 --> 09:22:56,909
REPUBLICANS WHO IS RUNNING IN A

TRUMP COMING INTO TOWN BOOSTING

15799
09:23:03,516 --> 09:23:05,184
TURN UP, TRYING TO CLOSE THAT

15800
09:23:05,184 --> 09:23:07,220
ENTHUSIASM GAP WITH DEMOCRATS IS

15801
09:23:07,220 --> 09:23:08,020
A GOOD THING.

15802
09:23:08,020 --> 09:23:10,489
THEN AGAIN TRUMP IS NOT THE MOST

15803
09:23:10,489 --> 09:23:14,326
POPULAR PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD.

15804
09:23:14,326 --> 09:23:16,729
IF YOU ARE RUNNING IN A DISTRICT

15805
09:23:16,729 --> 09:23:17,964

09:23:19,098 --> 09:23:20,900
MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU

15808
09:23:20,900 --> 09:23:23,469
THINK ARE GOOD FOR YOU.

15809
09:23:23,469 --> 09:23:26,239
THE ECONOMY, ABOUT TAXES, THE

15810
09:23:26,239 --> 09:23:27,406
TAX CUTS.

15811
09:23:27,406 --> 09:23:28,006
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT PRESIDENT

15812
09:23:28,006 --> 09:23:30,576
TRUMP COMING TO TOWN AND MAKING

15813
09:23:30,576 --> 09:23:34,012
THIS ALL ABOUT HIM AND INJECTING

15814
09:23:34,012 --> 09:23:35,147
EVEN MORE CONTROVERSY INTO

15815
09:23:35,147 --> 09:23:35,615
THINGS.

15816
09:23:35,615 --> 09:23:38,851
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ERIC

15817
09:23:38,851 --> 09:23:41,053
HOLDER WHO SAID THIS ON

15818
09:23:41,053 --> 09:23:41,854
WEDNESDAY.

15819
09:23:41,854 --> 09:23:43,856
QUOTE, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK

15820
09:23:43,856 --> 09:23:44,557
THEM.

15821
09:23:44,557 --> 09:23:46,792
WHICH WAS OF COURSE A PLAY ON

15822
09:23:46,792 --> 09:23:48,094
MICHELLE OBAMA'S FAMOUS QUOTE

15823
09:23:48,094 --> 09:23:50,997
WHEN THEY GO LOW WE GO HIGH.

15824
09:23:50,997 --> 09:23:54,133
THIS WAS FASCINATING TO ME

15825
09:23:54,133 --> 09:23:55,100
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORMER

15826
09:23:55,100 --> 09:23:56,502
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL,

15827
09:23:56,502 --> 09:23:59,004
SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE TOP LAW

15828
09:23:59,004 --> 09:24:01,507
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE

15829
09:24:01,507 --> 09:24:04,176
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SAYING

15830
09:24:04,176 --> 09:24:04,744
THIS.

15831
09:24:04,744 --> 09:24:06,244
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT --

15832
09:24:06,244 --> 09:24:14,320
ERIC HOLDER TAKERING THIS A TAKE

15833
09:24:14,320 --> 09:24:15,121
-- TAKING THIS

15834
09:24:15,121 --> 09:24:15,988
APPROACH AHEAD OF NOVEMBER?

15835
09:24:15,988 --> 09:24:17,690
>> WHEN I SAW THIS QUOTE POP UP

15836
09:24:17,690 --> 09:24:19,292
IN MY TWITTER FEED I HAD TO GO

15837
09:24:19,292 --> 09:24:21,560
AND FIND THE CLIP BECAUSE I WAS

15838
09:24:21,560 --> 09:24:22,929
SO SHOCKED BY THE QUOTE I WANTED

15839
09:24:22,929 --> 09:24:24,597
TO MAKE SURE THIS PEOPLE WERE

15840
09:24:24,597 --> 09:24:25,798
GETTING IT RIGHT.

15841
09:24:25,798 --> 09:24:27,900
THEY WERE GETTING IT RIGHT.

15842
09:24:27,900 --> 09:24:29,168
ERIC HOLDER DID SAY THIS.

15843
09:24:29,168 --> 09:24:30,469
THIS IS COMES AFTER HILLARY

15844
09:24:30,469 --> 09:24:31,971
CLINTON SAID AT THAT THE TIME

15845
09:24:31,971 --> 09:24:33,940
FOR CIVILITY IS OVER, WE HAVE TO

15846
09:24:33,940 --> 09:24:40,346
WIN BACK THE MAJORITIES AND

15847
09:24:40,346 --> 09:24:43,149
FIGHT, FIGHT,FIGHT AND THEN

15848
09:24:43,149 --> 09:24:46,885
THERE CAN BE TIME FOR CIVILITY.

15849
09:24:46,885 --> 09:24:49,021
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT WHOSE

15850
09:24:49,021 --> 09:24:49,888
SAYING THESE THINGS.

15851
09:24:49,888 --> 09:24:50,556
ITS PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

15852
09:24:50,556 --> 09:24:51,691
I GUESS IT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE

15853
09:24:51,691 --> 09:24:53,759
THINK THE MORAL HIGH GROUND IS

15854
09:24:53,759 --> 09:24:54,994
ONLY WORTH SO MUCH.

15855
09:24:54,994 --> 09:24:56,996
YOU KNOW THEY ARE TIRED OF

15856
09:24:56,996 --> 09:24:57,229
LOSING.

15857
09:24:57,229 --> 09:25:00,032
THIS IS KIND OF THE MICHAEL

15858
09:25:00,032 --> 09:25:00,699
SCHOOL OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.

15859
09:25:00,699 --> 09:25:02,301
HE'S BEEN SNIPING FROM THE

15860
09:25:02,301 --> 09:25:04,070
FRINGES AND SAYING WE NEED TO

15861
09:25:04,070 --> 09:25:04,770
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

15862
09:25:04,770 --> 09:25:08,640
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO' IF --

15863
09:25:08,640 --> 09:25:10,242
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE PEOPLE

15864
09:25:10,242 --> 09:25:13,612
WHO ARE ON THE BALLOT WILL TAKE

15865
09:25:13,612 --> 09:25:14,279
UP THE MESSAGE.

15866
09:25:14,279 --> 09:25:16,048
>> BECAUSE WHAT ELSE ARE WE

15867
09:25:16,048 --> 09:25:17,550
SEEING FROM DEMOCRATS WHO ARE

15868
09:25:17,550 --> 09:25:18,851
TRYING TO OBVIOUSLY FIRE UP

15869
09:25:18,851 --> 09:25:20,720
THEIR BASE AS WE HAVE SEEN

15870
09:25:20,720 --> 09:25:24,256
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO FIRE UP

15871
09:25:24,256 --> 09:25:24,556
THEIR SIDE?

15872
09:25:24,556 --> 09:25:24,890
>> IT VARIES.

15873
09:25:24,890 --> 09:25:26,459
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO

15874
09:25:26,459 --> 09:25:28,861
ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT

15875
09:25:28,861 --> 09:25:29,061
TRUMP.

15876
09:25:29,061 --> 09:25:30,229
WE RAN STRICTLY AGAINST TRUMP

15877
09:25:30,229 --> 09:25:31,564
LAST TIME AND WE LOST.

15878
09:25:31,564 --> 09:25:37,870
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US,

15879
09:25:37,870 --> 09:25:38,637
WHAT WE STAND FOR.

15880
09:25:38,637 --> 09:25:40,406
THERE ALSO SO MUCH ANGER IN THE

15881
09:25:40,406 --> 09:25:40,706
BASE.

15882
09:25:40,706 --> 09:25:42,341
PEOPLE ARE FURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS

15883
09:25:42,341 --> 09:25:44,477
HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AND

15884
09:25:44,477 --> 09:25:46,144
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.

15885
09:25:46,144 --> 09:25:47,780
PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT AS

15886
09:25:47,780 --> 09:25:48,080
WELL.

15887
09:25:48,080 --> 09:25:50,049
SO I THINK ITS GOING TO BE A

15888
09:25:50,049 --> 09:25:51,450
TEST FOR PEOPLE PARTICULARLY

15889
09:25:51,450 --> 09:25:51,984
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020.

15890
09:25:51,984 --> 09:25:55,388
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF THESE

15891
09:25:55,388 --> 09:25:58,224
PEOPLE WHO RUNS ANGRY OR WHO

15892
09:25:58,224 --> 09:25:58,991
RUNS WITH IDEAS?

15893
09:25:58,991 --> 09:26:00,626
I THINK IT IS A CHOICE THAT

15894
09:26:00,626 --> 09:26:01,694
DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO MAKE.

15895
09:26:01,694 --> 09:26:04,563
>> LETS TURN TO ANOTHER ISSUE

15896
09:26:04,563 --> 09:26:05,464
HERE.

15897
09:26:05,464 --> 09:26:06,298
NIKKI HALEY RESIGNED TUESDAY AS

15898
09:26:06,298 --> 09:26:09,101
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. OR SHE

15899
09:26:09,101 --> 09:26:10,369
ANNOUNCED HER PLANS TO RESIGN.

15900
09:26:10,369 --> 09:26:11,504
SHE'S NOT LEAVING TILL TEND OF

15901
09:26:11,504 --> 09:26:12,638
THE YEAR.

15902
09:26:12,638 --> 09:26:13,606
YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT HER

15903
09:26:13,606 --> 09:26:14,173
DEPARTURE.

15904
09:26:14,173 --> 09:26:16,308
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

15905
09:26:16,308 --> 09:26:16,841
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN

15906
09:26:16,841 --> 09:26:17,075
POLICY?

15907
09:26:17,075 --> 09:26:21,414
>> FIRST OF ALL HE HAS TO FIND A

15908
09:26:21,414 --> 09:26:21,714
REPLACEMENT.

15909
09:26:21,714 --> 09:26:22,815
MY COLLEAGUES ARE REPORTING THAT

15910
09:26:22,815 --> 09:26:25,084
POWELL, SHE WAS THE DEPUTY

15911
09:26:25,084 --> 09:26:26,051
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.

15912
09:26:26,051 --> 09:26:26,886
SHE LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION.

15913
09:26:26,886 --> 09:26:29,522
SHE APPEARS TO BE THE FRONT

15914
09:26:29,522 --> 09:26:31,056
RUNNER IF SHE WANTS THE JOB.

15915
09:26:31,056 --> 09:26:32,858
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW NIKKI HALEY IS

15916
09:26:32,858 --> 09:26:33,292
AN INTERESTING CASE.

15917
09:26:33,292 --> 09:26:41,667
SHE IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO

15918
09:26:41,667 --> 09:26:42,167
SERVED IN THIS ADMISSION

15919
09:26:42,167 --> 09:26:44,136
STRAIGHT AND CAME OUT WITH HER

15920
09:26:44,136 --> 09:26:45,571
STAR BURNING BRIGHTER.

15921
09:26:45,571 --> 09:26:46,439
THE PART OF WHAT PEOPLE IN TRUMP

15922
09:26:46,439 --> 09:26:47,940
WORLD WANTED TO DO WAS DAMP DOWN

15923
09:26:47,940 --> 09:26:55,347
THE IDEA SHE WAS GOING TO BE

15924
09:26:55,347 --> 09:26:56,415
CHALLENGING PRESIDENT TRUMP.

15925
09:26:56,415 --> 09:26:57,048
SHE DID THAT HERSELF.

15926
09:26:57,048 --> 09:26:59,251
>> REALLY FASCINATING TO SEE

15927
09:26:59,251 --> 09:26:59,919
WHAT SHE WILL DO NEXT.

15928
09:26:59,919 --> 09:27:02,922
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

15929
09:27:02,922 --> 09:27:03,389

FOR MANY YEARS BY REPUBLICANS

15940
09:27:19,205 --> 09:27:21,840
BUT EVERY REPUBLICAN THINKS THEY

15941
09:27:21,840 --> 09:27:22,474
WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA.

15942
09:27:22,474 --> 09:27:26,979
THEY DIDN'T QUITE GET IT BUT I

15943
09:27:26,979 --> 09:27:27,212

09:27:41,526 --> 09:27:44,463
ITS THE PERSON THAT GOT AWAY.

15953
09:27:44,463 --> 09:27:46,398
IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

15954
09:27:46,398 --> 09:27:48,601
PENNSYLVANIA -- HE SAID DO IT

15955
09:27:48,601 --> 09:27:48,834

DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID?

15961
09:27:57,877 --> 09:28:02,481
SO THERE IS AN EXPRESSION BUT WE

15962
09:28:02,481 --> 09:28:03,115
WILL CHANGE THE EXPRESSION.

15963
09:28:03,115 --> 09:28:04,550
