00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
Hi friends so I'm from Wisconsin where
we put cheese on our heads

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,460
cheese on our money cheese on our cheese

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,910
I even come from dairy farms on my dad's
side so at this point what runs through

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,030
my veins is just liquid gruyÃ¨re

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,810
I don't tell you this to like upset
vegans I still love you

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,460
vegans I just tell you this because I
didn't realize just how much of an

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,580
impact moldy milk has had on my life

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,269
so you know when you had to sell
magazines or candy or wrapping paper and

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,219
grade schools of fundraiser

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,850
well in true wisco fashion my school
sold cheese people went bananas for that

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,570
cheese

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,809
we sold bricks upon bricks upon bricks
of it

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,800
I still have the American Girl doll that
I want as a prize for spelling so much

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,030
as proof

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,570
so one day when we had a school in
service my dad decided to keep my

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,969
brother and I entertain by driving us up
to Belgium Wisconsin to see where they

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,260
made the cheese

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,770
I was maybe eight years old still in the
stage where I insisted on wearing the

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,920
same purple polar fleece every single
day

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,799
not yet too cool to enjoy driving over
the rolling hills of Wisconsin with my

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,150
dad to learn how cheese was made and
like most small towns in Wisconsin

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,710
they're just several independent cheese
shops just dotting the highway and from

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,759
the outside Cedar Valley cheese looks
like just any other one of them but as

24
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,299
soon as my dad tipped them off that
we're from that one school that moves

25
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,740
their cheese like professionals they
treated us like we were celebrities

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,720
we got to go behind the scenes and cv
big metal box of Milk getting all enzyme

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,290
dup and separating into curds and whey

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,360
I may have even gotten to sneak a few
fresh squeakers they give us all the

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,200
cheese samples that my little stomach
could take and at the end of the tour

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,340
I even got a little cow shaped beanie
baby that sat on my shoulder the entire

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,900
ride home

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,590
it remains one of the best afternoons of
my life and it was only one of the first

33
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,530
times that a cheese related incident
gave me comfort

34
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,760
like when I first considered moving to
Seattle and went out to visit a little

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,399
bit rattled in the sea tac airport on
the way home

36
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,530
I spotted a local cheese kiosk with a
sign on the counter that said what our

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,730
cheese curds

38
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,060
it was a massive dose of culture shock
to me like what

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,830
there are people who don't know there
are people in this world that have not

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,660
experienced nature's freshest squeakiest
most perfect form of cheese

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,850
I couldn't stop laughing and yet the
thought but there was a place where I

42
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,320
could get fresh cheese curds made it
start to seem like this was a place I

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,580
could actually live in a couple of weeks
ago when I was having panic attacks over

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,660
cacti

45
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,580
I found an about in franchise of a
Midwestern fast food chain that sells

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,750
greasy deep-fried wisconsin cheese curds

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,030
they're not like squeaky fresh but for
the next five months bill do you know

48
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,800
it's like a Lorelai Gilmore has that
thing with snow that whenever it shows

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,530
up something wonderful happens

50
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,570
that's what it's like for me except
cheese so I want to know in the comments

51
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,760
is there any kind of food that is
somehow inextricably tied to your

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,140
identity and if you liked this video you
