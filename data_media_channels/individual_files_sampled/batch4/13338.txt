witches are joining together across the country to perform black magic rituals that will put a curse on Donald Trump I am NOT making this up the witches are organizing through social media to summon quote demons of the infernal realms to ensure the president will quote fail utterly the rituals include burning a picture of Trump and visualizing the president quote blowing apart into dust or ash unquote at 1:00 midnight gathering on a lonely moonlit Hill three hideous old crones were recently seen dancing around a steaming cauldron throwing ingredients into the brew the chief witch and unbearably ugly hag was heard chanting quote double trouble our party's in rubble we've been living in a bubble I have Newt and nose of Ryan Hart of Putin who's been spying McConnell's waddle van ins rump how the hell did I lose to Donald Trump the International Association of witches refused to release the chief witch's name though she was heard unleashing an ear-splitting cackle before flying through the trees in her magic pantsuit the second of the three Weird Sisters on leave from her day job as House Minority Leader was also heard chanting bizarre gibberish then after her interview with CNN Nancy Pelosi hurried to join the rest of her coven at the cauldron was she added to the mix by throwing in parts of babies she had purchased at the butcher's counter at her local Planned Parenthood at a press conference afterward miss Pelosi told reporters quote these powerful rituals will really put a spell on President Bush unquote when told Bush was no longer president Palouse Pelosi said quote well whoever's president whatever it is we're doing here will stop him from doing whatever it is he's doing where my name isn't Dolly Madison unquote when told that her name was not in fact Dolly Madison miss Pelosi said quote well where am I then unquote the third horrific battle ax was seen dancing around the cauldron chanting quote chump will never win the game for focus is my name the grizzly harpy then donned an Indian headdress in the hope she would be able to parade herself as not just another Medusa like termagant able to conjure demons out of the pits of hell but also as a minority she then led the rest of her party and a bizarre Indian dance in which they kept turning to the left until they ended up in exactly the same place namely losing to Donald Trump President Trump responded to the supernatural threats by saying he was not afraid of the witch's spells because he knew much better spells and it was not just him saying that but many many people had said his spells were the best spells believe me after the witch's ceremony was over the three grotesque of arago x' attempted to fly away on broomsticks but discovered they had no idea how to use a broom because none of them had ever done an honest day's work in her life trigger warning i'm andrew Clavin and this is the andrew Clavin show Shaitan see Topsy lower the Zipit easing it's a wonderful the Android Labor's over the Democrats supply the satire and I just read all right it's mailbag day but before yeah but before we get to the mailbag which comes after the break so if you're on Facebook or YouTube you got to come on over to the daily wire comm and subscribe so next week you too can have a question in the mailbag first look we got to talk about the speech holy moly I know we got together JK and Jeremy boring who is the god king of the daily wire and Michael Knowles who is just a lackey I mean we got together and we sat and watched this thing and it this is obviously Trump's pseudo State of the Union address it's not really the state of the union's just addressing a joint session of Congress and we we started like this isn't bad wait this is good holy moly this is great this is and the Democrats were so taken by surprise that he delivered like this that they were caught out looking like small bitter on American people they don't applaud for education they don't apply they don't flood for I mean this this of course was the major moment in the first the first soldier killed on his watch was a Navy SEAL this guy Ryan Owens and he paid tribute to him that the mission was planned before took office but then it was carried carried forward in Yemen to gather some intelligence and Trump paid tribute to him so here's a little bit of the tribute II fade I just spoke to our great general mattis just now who reconfirmed that and I quote Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity thank you and Ryan is looking down right now you know that and he's very happy because I think he just broke a record firs the Bible teaches us there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends Ryan lay down his life for his friends for his country and for our freedom and we will never forget Ryan okay so this is two minutes of applause this beautiful lines beautiful widow Karen is on her feet looking up to heaven saying I love you baby right the whole place is rocking with applause honoring this man who gave his life for his country and some of the Democrats are seen it's an unbelievable image at Keith Ellison and Nancy Pelosi sat down after a while he's looking bitter you know just oh it was awful it was awful and they've been sitting on their hands for American jobs they're not applauding for American jobs they're not applauding for education they're not appointing for anything because they thought that Trump was gonna come in and give one of his usual kind of you know pugilistic dark speeches and so they were so ready to sneer that they just looked terrible he caught them he wrong-footed them so badly it was an amazing moment I think I'm sorry but I think we have to play the Trump happiness montage we're gonna win so much we're gonna win at every level we're gonna win economically we're gonna win with the economy we're gonna win with military we're gonna win with healthcare and for our veterans we're gonna win with every single facet what a wonderful day we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of winning yeah you'll say please please it's too much winning we can't take it anymore I feel pretty oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty and guess we have to keep winning we have to win this thing you know this was one of the most dramatic political moments I have seen actually in my life it was so dramatic and I want to explain why I think this Trump is a master there are two speeches here that we have to talk about one is the political speech and the other is the substantive speech the political speech is a masterpiece I mean it was one of it is it's probably the best let me think about this one that's the best State of the Union certainly in the last two administrations certainly Obama never gave a good one and George W Bush never gave a good speech ever so you know I think it was this guy certainly the best like in the last ten years at least 'men master at changing the narrative this is what he knows you know that press conference he gave where all the reporters were saying oh it was belligerent it was mean it was he made this mistake he made that mistake that ended this stupid and untrue Russian conspiracy thing that they were building up to members like the day before - eight days before Chuck Todd says welcome to day one of the biggest scandal ever gone gone he just took it away now the whole thing is this tumultuous what the what the mainstream media always do is they report things that may or may not be true and then they just assume them to be true so they say there's chaos in the White House well the Trump administration says no there's no chaos here you know we've made some mistakes there going forward it doesn't seem it doesn't seem like ass to me but I don't know the truth I'm not there but then all the press does is will they lead every story with the chaotic opening month of the Trump administration the chaos this the chaos that unpresidential this Trump just took that and he blew it up and the whole speech was constructed to do that you know this here's a phrase I heard maybe four times from different commentators but I brought in this one because it's Van Jones who is obviously far far far to the left the phrase was Trump now is the president he Tremp Trump became the president and Van Jones was talking about the moment where he honored the Navy SEAL he really became President of the United States in that moment period there are a lot of people who have a lot of reason to be frustrated with him to be fearful of him to be mad at him but that was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics period and he did something extraordinary and for people who have been hoping that he would become unifying hoping that he might find some way to become presidential they should be happy with that moment for people who have been hoping that maybe he would remain a divisive cartoon which he often finds a way to do they should begin to become a little bit worried tonight because that thing you just saw him do if he finds a way to do that over and over again he's gonna be there for eight years now there is a lot that he said in that speech that was counterfactual that was not right that I opposed and will oppose but he did something tonight that you cannot take away from him see that Van Jones was slammed for this you know that people who were tweeting whether he's a traitor he's this he's that he's you know it's all wrong but that was Van Jones actually and I gotta give him props for this he is so far to the left he's fallen off the edge of the world and I disagree with everything he says most of the time but that was Van Jones adapting to a situation and that's what the Democrats failed to do they didn't see that they were being run over by freight train and they just looked down on the tracks so this is this indicates now I'm I'm a slow guy to take someone I don't know and attribute personality traits to I mean this is something I hear people doing all the time you know like he's he's a narcissist he's this he's that if you don't know the guy it just takes a long time to observe things but the one thing I've observed about Trump is that he learned stuff this is what he told us he would do he said you know we said you don't know anything about being president and he said basically I'll learn and I'll appoint the best people he has appointed the best people and he does learn you know he was on Fox and Friends just the other day saying they asked him to grade his administration and he said of course I mean when you asked that of Donald Trump you assume he's going to a plus on everything and he said a plus for everything I've done but only a C or a c plus for the way I've communicated what I've done and he changed that everybody said he's too dark you know his inaugural address was too dark so he opens up the speech like this is not the very opening of the speech each American generation passes the torch of truth liberty and justice and an unbroken chain all the way down to the present that torch is now in our hands and we will use it to light up the world I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart a new chapter of American greatness is now beginning a new national pride is sweeping across our nation and a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp what we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead all the nations of the world friend or foe will find that America is strong America is proud and America is free the Democrats again they're ready for one thing and they're getting another and they're sitting on their hands you know you're not applauding for the fact that America is free but he changed he got it he got he's got to put in got to start with you know the good stuff also and this is another thing about being the master of narrative all we've heard the Democrat talking point that was going around three days was he hasn't accomplished anything so he started the speech with a list of his accomplishments all these executive orders still this is him coming to Congress asking for stuff and he asked the stuff that he wants he starts to talk about the border and this was really interesting because he he kind of has indicated that he will negotiate with the Democrats on this and do something I've said from the I've been saying now for two years basically there's gonna be some kind of amnesty nobody is gonna have mass deportations it just isn't going to happen you know and I think they can either ignore the fact that people are here illegally or give them some kind of path to citizenship and nobody even the people who think they want to see mass deportations really want to see them because once those come on your TV screen and once you see little children being torn out of their mother's arms you're not gonna like it so much nobody's gonna like it and and it's gonna you know either way it is popularity hey I got to stop and say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but the
