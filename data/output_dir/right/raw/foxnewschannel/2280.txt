1
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:09,761
>> Julie: SO NORTH KOREA

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,763
REPORTEDLY MAKING NEW PROMISES

3
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:13,364
CONCERNING THEIR NUCLEAR TEST

4
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:14,599
SITE VOWING TO SHUT IT DOWN

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,602
AFTER ITS SUMMIT WITH THE SOUTH

6
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,604
AND AHEAD OF A PRESIDENTIAL

7
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,205
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

8
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:23,641
KIM JONG-UN IS LOOKING FOR A

9
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,476
SECURITY GUARANTEE FROM THE U.S.

10
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:26,144
IN RETURN.

11
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:29,080
THE QUESTION IS CAN HE BE

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,514
TRUSTED.

13
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:32,583
>> I THINK IF HE HAS MADE A

14
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,252
STRATEGIC DETERMINATION THAT

15
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:40,558
NORTH KOREA WOULD BE BETTER OFF

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,161
WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE HAVE

17
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,829
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

18
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:51,102
IT'S UP TO THE NORTH KOREANS TO

19
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:55,239
SHOW US THEY DO PLAN ON GIVING

20
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,508
UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

21
00:00:57,508 --> 00:01:00,144
>> Julie: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT

22
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,079
KIND OF SECURITY GUARANTEE IS

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,147
KIM JONG-UN TALKING ABOUT?

24
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,083
>> I THINK EVENTUALLY IN THE

25
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,085
SHORT TERM, HE'S GOING TO BE

26
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:08,886
LONGING FOR A SUSPENSION AS THE

27
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:09,654
TALKS GO ALONG.

28
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:10,989
THAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW.

29
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,724
AS THE TALKS PROGRESS, HE WILL

30
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,959
BE LOOKING FOR A SUSPENSION OF

31
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,327
MILITARY EXERCISES.

32
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,862
THE DEAL TO BE HAD IN THE

33
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:19,497
LONG-TERM AND WHAT HE WILL BE

34
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,832
LOOKING FOR IS FOR THE UNITED

35
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,967
STATES TO EITHER GREATLY

36
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,603
MINIMIZE OR COMPLETELY WITHDRAW

37
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:26,904
TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA.

38
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,206
THAT IS SOMETHING OVER THE

39
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:33,244
WEEKEND GENERAL MATTIS SEEMED TO

40
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:36,280
INDICATE COULD BE PART OF A

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,248
LONGER TERM DEAL.

42
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:40,018
>> Julie: THE PROBLEM IS

43
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:40,485
HISTORY.

44
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:40,985
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

45
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:44,589
>> Julie: SIMILAR PROMISES WERE

46
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:45,957
MADE IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

47
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:47,058
HOW IS THIS ANY DIFFERENT?

48
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:48,426
>> WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN,

49
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,428
THERE WAS THIS INCREMENTAL

50
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:50,795
APPROACH.

51
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:52,730
THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD GIVE

52
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:59,570
SOME CONCESSIONS AND WE GIVE

53
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,707
FUEL AID AND OTHER PIECES, THIS

54
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:03,875
ADMINISTRATION, WHAT GIVES ME

55
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,143
OPTIMISM, A FEW THINGS.

56
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:06,844
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS EXTRACTED

57
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:08,746
CONCESSIONS THAT MILITARY

58
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:10,815
EXERCISES WILL CONTINUE.

59
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,250
SANCTIONS WILL STAY IN PLACE AND

60
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,285
THAT I THINK THE BIGGEST PIECE

61
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,454
IS THAT HE HAS INDICATED HE WILL

62
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:17,522
WALK AWAY.

63
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:19,824
I CAN SEE THAT BEING FRAMED OUT

64
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:20,925
IN THREE DIFFERENT

65
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:21,359
CIRCUMSTANCES.

66
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:23,961
ONE, IF KIM JONG-UN IS JUST

67
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:27,298
TRYING TO USE THIS FOR SYMBOLISM

68
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,734
TO BE SEEN AS ON PART WITH THE

69
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:32,703
PRESIDENT FOR HIS OWN DOMESTIC

70
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:33,905
PROPAGANDA REASONS, TWO, IF

71
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,007
HE'S -- HE'S TAKING A PLAY OUT

72
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:38,609
OF THE OLD NORTH KOREAN

73
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:39,710
PLAYBOOK, LET'S DRAG THIS ALONG.

74
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,146
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, IF WE

75
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,948
GET BOGGED DOWN WHEN THE

76
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,284
INSPECTORS CAN COME IN, HOW MUCH

77
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,819
NOTICE AND MEANWHILE THE NORTH

78
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:55,426
KOREAN MISSILE ENNEARS ARE --

79
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,828
ENGINEERS THAT ICBM.

80
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:58,129
>> Julie: AND HOW ABOUT JAPAN?

81
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,932
DO THEY NEED TO BE ON THE SAME

82
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:01,232
SIDE?

83
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:04,068
>> THE SOUTH KOREANS AND THE

84
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,605
JAPANESE STILL HAVE A LOT OF BAD

85
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,707
FEELINGS, SO TO SPEAK, LEFT OVER

86
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,509
FROM WORLD WAR II.

87
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,044
THEY'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE

88
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:14,612
THAT PRESIDENT MOON WANTS A DEAL

89
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:14,946
BADLY.

90
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,048
HE'S A PROGRESSIVE AND REALLY

91
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:19,784
WANT TO OUTREACH TO HIS NORTH

92
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,853
KOREAN COUNTER PARTS.

93
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,888
THE JAPANESE ARE LED BY A

94
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:24,989
CONSERVATIVE ABE WHO DOES NOT

95
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,424
BELIEVE IN HAVING TALKS FOR THE

96
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:27,525
SAKE OF IT.

97
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:30,328
WHAT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT

98
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,930
SHORT AND MEDIUM RANGE MISSILES

99
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,966
WILL BE LEFT OUT OF THIS.

100
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,869
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE

101
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,805
WORRIED ABOUT THE ICBM MISSILES

102
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,107
AND THE JAPANESE CONCERNS WON'T

103
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,742
BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

104
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:46,210
>> Julie: CREDIT GIVEN WHERE

105
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,545
CREDIT DO.

106
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:50,348
THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT STRIDES

107
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:52,817
BETWEEN THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS

108
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:53,284
ADMINISTRATION.

109
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:54,585
THERE'S CONCERN THAT THIS COULD

110
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:56,487
BE A PROPAGANDA WIN FOR KIM

111
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,489
JONG-UN TO HAVE A FACE-TO-FACE

112
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,123
MEETING WITH POTUS.

113
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:00,725
THE GUY NEVER LEFT HIS OWN

114
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:01,058
COUNTRY.

115
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:02,627
THEN HE GOES TO CHINA AND NOW

116
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:05,663
HE'S WILLING TO MEET WITH THE

117
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,030
PRESIDENT.

118
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,899
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

119
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,033
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT.

120
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,936
>> I THINK -- ABSOLUTELY.

121
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:13,738
THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS EYES WIDE

122
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:14,105
OPEN.

123
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,908
JOHN BOLTON IS CERTAINLY ON

124
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,976
RECORD AS A NORTH KOREAN SKEPTIC

125
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:19,944
AND RIGHTLY SO.

126
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:22,012
AND MIKE POMPEO IS GOING TO TAKE

127
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,615
A VERY TOUGH APPROACH AS WELL,

128
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:27,385
AGAIN, AS LONG AS THE SANCTIONS

129
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:29,120
STAY IN PLACE AND OUR FOOT STAYS

130
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,622
ON THE NECK OF THE NORTH KOREAN

131
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:33,157
ECONOMY WITH CHINESE SUPPORT AND

132
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:35,226
WITH THE FULL U.N. SUPPORT, I

133
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:38,262
THINK WE'LL BE IN GOOD SHAPE.

134
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:42,567
WE HAVE TO HAVE VERIFYING FULL

135
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,168
DENUCLEARIZATION BEFORE WE MAKE

136
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,270
ANY CONCESSIONS.

137
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,305
>> Julie: SOUNDS PROMISING.

138
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,039
I CAN'T LIE.

139
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,740
THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

140
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,608
STRIDE WE'VE SEEN MADE.

141
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:51,475
>> ABSOLUTELY.

142
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:53,144
THE KEY HERE -- AND THE

143
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,845
PRESIDENT KNEW THIS -- IS WE HAD

144
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:58,049
TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE IF THEY GET

145
00:04:58,049 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD MAKE THEIR
