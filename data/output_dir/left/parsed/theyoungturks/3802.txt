HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS IN
IOWA ARE UNDER FIRE AFTER
THEY DECIDED TO BURN A CROSS
WHILE WEARING KKK GARB AND
PROCEEDED TO POST ABOUT
IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
THOSE ARE FIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO
ARE PART OF A SMALL TOWN
FOOTBALL TEAM IN CRESTON, IOWA,
AND THEY ARE AT CRESTON
HIGH SCHOOL.
THIS DEBATE HAS EMERGED
REGARDING WHAT RIGHTS
ADMINISTRATORS HAVE TO PUNISH OR
MAKE THE STUDENTS
PAY CONSEQUENCES.
THEY HAVE BEEN BOOTED FROM THE
FOOTBALL TEAM SO THAT HAS ALREADY
HAPPENED BUT SOME ARE
QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT THERE
ARE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS
FOR THE STUDENTS HERE.
ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS, THE FIRST
AMENDMENT HAS EVEN MORE
LIMITATIONS.
IF THE BEHAVIOR OR THE SPEECH OF
A PARTICULAR STUDENT IS A
DISTRACTION AND IS DISTRACTING
OTHER STUDENTS FROM A SOUND
EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT,
ADMINISTRATORS CAN TAKE
MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS SO
THERE ARE EVEN MORE LIMITS
ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS.
HOWEVER, IN THIS CASE, THIS DID
NOT HAPPEN ON THE SCHOOL
CAMPUS AND THEY ALSO DIDN'T
TARGET A SPECIFIC STUDENT,
SO THE ABILITY FOR THE
ADMINISTRATORS TO PASS DOWN ANY
SORT OF PUNISHMENT IS INCREDIBLY
LIMITED, ACCORDING TO SOME.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
HERE ARE THE ARGUMENTS IN TERMS
OF WHAT ADMINISTRATORS CAN DO
IN TERMS OF PUNISHMENT.
THERE 
IS 
PRECEDENT REGARDING
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS.
NOT NECESSARILY RACIAL ISSUES,
BUT THINGS WERE STUDENTS HAVE
DONE SOMETHING QUESTIONABLE,
ADMINISTRATORS WANTED TO
TAKE ACTION AND IN THAT SUPREME
COURT RULED ON IT.
LIMIT GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLES.
SO IF IT IS A DIRECT THREAT.
IF THEY ARE TARGETING A SPECIFIC
INDIVIDUAL, THERE IS A CASE TO
BE MADE THAT ADMINISTRATORS
CAN'T ALLOW SOME SORT OF
PUNISHMENT.
HOWEVER, IF IT IS JUST A
POLITICAL STATEMENT WHICH
IN THIS CASE, THE ARGUMENT IS
THAT THEY ARE MAKING A
POLITICAL STATEMENT EVEN
THOUGH IT IS DISGUSTING, THEN
ADMINISTERS CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.
THOUGHTS?
DEFINITELY OFF THE FOOTBALL
TEAM.
I GET IT.
THEY HAVE BLACK FOOTBALL
TEAMMATES.
AND THIS IS NOT AN AMBIGUOUS
SYMBOL.
THE WEARING OF A DASH THEY TALK
ABOUT THE AMBIGUITY AS TO
WHETHER IT IS DIRECTED TO ANY
INDIVIDUAL, BUT THERE IS NOTHING
LESS AMBIGUOUS AND WEARING A
HOOD LIKE THIS AND BURNING A
CROSS.
I DON'T KNOW, I WOULD STAY
WITHIN THE LEGAL BOUNDS OF
WHATEVER THE SCHOOL BOARD CAN OR
CAN'T DO.
I WOULD GO TO THE FURTHEST
EXTENT AND GETTING THEM OFF
THE FOOTBALL TEAM IS A GOOD
START, BUT THIS IS NOT A
SUN RISING OR A SUNSETTING, YOU
MAKE THE CALL.
THIS HE THESE ARE DASH THIS IS
LIKE THE NAME ADOLF, A
SWASTIKA, THESE ARE VERY CLEAR
INDICATORS THAT YOU ARE
AFFILIATING YOURSELF WITH THE
HAY GROUP AND BY THAT
DEFINITION, I WOULD GO AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE.
I AM STRUCK BY THE, ONE OF THOSE
DECISIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED
WHERE A TEENAGER BURNED ACROSS
ON THE LAWN OF AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILY AND THEY
OVERTURNED THE CONVICTION BUT
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
THERE IS NO LEGAL REMEDY?
THERE'S NO CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT
THAT YOU CAN BRING AGAINST
THAT PERSON?
I THINK YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.
I REALLY WANT TO LOOK INTO
THE DETAILS OF THAT RULING
BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT I KNOW
RIGHT NOW, IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.
NO TRESPASS DATING OR
LANDSCAPE VANDALISM?
IT'S A PRIVATE PROPERTY YOU
CAN AT LEAST MAKE THE CASE
IT WAS TRESPASSING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMEONE BURNING
A CROSS ON YOUR FRONT LAWN
AND THEN THE SUPREME COURT
OVERTURNING A CONVICTION?
THAT'S INSANE BUT I WILL LOOK
INTO THAT.
LOOK, I DO AGREE THAT THE
ADMINISTRATORS POWER IS LIMITED
IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED
WHEN CLASS WAS NOT IN SESSION.
IT DID NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE
SCHOOL CAMPUS AND THIS
DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO DO WITH
RACIAL ISSUES.
THIS ISSUE COMES UP A LOT WHEN
IT COMES UP TO BULLYING.
EITHER ONLINE, OR AFTER SCHOOL
HOURS.
WHAT CAN ADMINISTRATORS DO TO
PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE
BULLYING OTHER STUDENTS?
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING
TO PLAY OUT.
PRESIDENT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
AND IT IS ALSO HOW LIBERAL I
AM GOING TO BE I GUESS FOR
LACK OF A BETTER WORD, ON THE
ONE HAND PART OF ME IS LIKE
YOU ARE OFF THE FOOTBALL TEAM.
YOU ARE EXPELLED FROM THE
SCHOOL.
THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR
THAT WE THINK IS BE BIDDING
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ATTEND HERE SO
WERE GOING TO PUT SEVERE AT
LEAST EXTENDED SUSPICIONS ON YOU
BECAUSE THIS DOES SEEM LIKE
THE KIND OF THING THAT KIDS DO
FOR ATTENTION PROBABLY AND
IT IS STUPID.
IT IS MISGUIDED AND I THINK THEY
NEED TO SUFFER CONSEQUENCES OR
THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE A
SCHOOL IN THE FIRST PLACE
BECAUSE WE ARE TEACHING KIDS
THINGS AND WE CAN'T REINFORCE
THIS AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT WHAT THEY
DID IS BAD.
ANOTHER THING, IT'S LIKE MORE OF
AN EDUCATIONAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL
PSYCHOLOGY THING IS WHEN YOU
READ UP ON KIDS TO GET OUT INTO
WEIRD LITTLE SUBCULTURES LIKE
WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS, I'VE
READ A COUPLE OF BOOKS ON THIS
AND A LOT OF THEM POINT TO
HAVING A COMMUNITY.
IT IS LIKE A GANG.
IT IS GANG BEHAVIOR,
TERRORIST BEHAVIOR IN DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE WORLD, BUT FOR THE
TEENAGENESS ITSELF IS A
CONSTRUCT INVENTED BY AMERICANS
IN THE 1950S BUT TO HAVE A
COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T REINFORCE
THE BEHAVIOR OF WHITE SUPREMACY,
THE TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF THAT IS
A FOOTBALL TEAM WERE PEOPLE OF
ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS HAVE
TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK
TOGETHER BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW
GOOD THE COACH IS AT MAKING
THAT HAPPEN, SITTING THESE KIDS
DOWN TOGETHER AND SAYING
LISTEN, THIS IS NOT GOING TO
FLY.
I THINK THAT IS AFTER SOME VERY
CONCRETE PUNISHMENT THAT IS
COMES INTO PLAY.
UNLESS THERE IS MASSIVE PUSHBACK
FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE
SCHOOL BOARD AND THE FOOTBALL
TEAM AND EVERYONE THAT THEY
COME INTO CONTACT WITH THAT THIS
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND THIS
IS NOT OKAY.
SO THIS DIDN'T TAKE PLACE ON
CAMPUS DURING SCHOOL HOURS
AS YOU GUYS MENTIONED.
SO THEY WONDER HOW MUCH ONE CAN
DO BUT IF YOU THINK THESE
GUYS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN
THIS KIND OF ACTION WHEN
THEY ARE NOT A SCHOOL IF IT
ISN'T BEING DISCUSSED,
TALKED ABOUT, IMPLEMENTED,
HAPPENING IN THE REST OF
THEIR LIFE, YOU'RE CRAZY.
THIS IS WHERE THE PERCEPTION Ã±
THERE WAS THE GUY WHO
MURDERED A COUPLE OF BLACK GUYS
IN BATON ROUGE AND ONE OF
THE HEADLINES SAYS A CLEAN-CUT
AMERICAN DAD DOES THIS.
AND PEOPLE LIKE HOW CAN THIS
HAPPEN?
BECAUSE IT'S WITHIN THE
COMMUNITY, IT'S IN HIS
MINDSET, IT IS WHO HE IS.
THAT PERCEPTION OF THIS IS
JUST A WHITE GUY WHO MADE A
MISTAKE AND HE HAD SOME YOUTHFUL
EXUBERANCE AND ALL THAT, IT
IS ACTUALLY REAL.
LET'S
THINK ABOUT THIS, THERE'S A
LATINO OR BLACK GANG - GUYS IN
GANGS AND GO TO SCHOOL.
WE KNOW THERE ARE METAL
DETECTORS AT SCHOOLS AND
BAD COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY
THINK THEY ARE GOING TO
BRING THE STUFF INTO THE SCHOOL.
HOW DO WE NOT THINK THAT THIS
GANG IS GOING TO BRING
THEIR STUFF INTO THE SCHOOL?
THEY START BANNING THESE GANG
MEMBERS FROM COMING INTO SCHOOLS
ARE MAKING SURE THEY DON'T BRING
THEIR STUFF INTO THAT SCHOOL.
WE HAVE TO SEE THE SAME WAY.
WE ARE AFRAID OF THOSE MINORITY
GANGS BUT WHY ARE WE AFRAID
OF THIS GANG WHO HAS A VERY LONG
HISTORY OF DOING THINGS TO
HARM PEOPLE.
IF ANYTHING, IT IS TO PROTECT
YOUR SCHOOL.
IT IS JUST A PERCEPTION OF THESE
KIND OF GUYS, THEY'RE BAD
GUYS AND THEY CAN HURT PEOPLE,
BUT THEY ARE NOT THAT BAD.
IT IS JUST AN AFTERSCHOOL
ACTIVITY RATHER THAN THEIR LIFE.
SO WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?
IS THERE A REHABILITATING?
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY, HOW
LIBERAL AM I?
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A PLACE IF I'M
JUST GOING TO SAY, LET'S TAKE
THE GANG MEMBER, THE WHITE KID,
LET'S MAKE THEM BETTER THROUGH
SCHOOL.
YOU KNOW?
FIRST SEEING EVERYBODY GETTING A
PUNISHMENT.
IN THE COMMUNITY.
IT'S LIKE WITH OUR SOCIETY IN
GENERAL.
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT?
THERE ARE BAD APPLES IN THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT
REALLY THAT ENDS UP DESTROYING
ALL OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE
THEY STARTED PROTECTING EACH
OTHER.
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE MINDSET OF
A SOCIETY?
BECAUSE POLICE OFFICERS AS I'VE
SAID BEFORE JUST MEMBERS OF
SOCIETY WHO CAN SHE GIVE FOR THE
JOB.
I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT.
BY THE WAY, I WANT TO BE CLEAR
ABOUT SOMETHING BECAUSE
THERE IS WHAT I WOULD WANT TO
DO, AND THEN THERE'S WHAT
THE LAW WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO.
IF I JUST ACTED BASED ON MY OWN
INSTINCT AND DID WHAT I
WANTED TO DO AND IGNORE THE LAW,
THEY ARE OUT.
THERE COMPLETELY OUT.
BUT I'M SIMPLY JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS
THE STUDENTS HAVE WHICH BY THE
WAY, I'M VERY CURIOUS IF
SIMILAR PROTECTIONS WOULD BE
EXTENDED.
WOULD WE HAVE THIS KIND OF
DEBATE AND I THINK THIS GOES TO
YOUR POINT, JAYAR, WHEN WE HAVE
THIS KIND OF DEBATE IF WE HAD A
GROUP OF BLACK KIDS FROM THIS
HIGH SCHOOL GETTING TOGETHER AND
TALKING ABOUT, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW.
DOING SOMETHING THAT'S PERCEIVED
AS RACIST TOWARDS WHITE
STUDENTS?
THAT WOULD BE A NATIONAL STORY
THAT PEOPLE WOULD NOT STOP
TALKING ABOUT.
THIS HAPPENED A MONTH AGO AND
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
OCCURRED I DIDN'T EVEN GET ANY
COVERAGE UNTIL NOW.
SO ANYWAY, THE POINT THAT I
WANTED TO MAKE -
IT LOOK SO RIDICULOUS IS WHAT I
THINK IT IS.
THEY DO LOOK RIDICULOUS AND
WHETHER THEY WANTED THIS
FOR ATTENTION OR WHETHER THEY
ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN WHAT
THEY'RE DOING, THAT DOESN'T
MATTER.
WHAT DOES MATTER IN MY EYES IS
EDUCATION BECAUSE EDUCATION
IS WHAT HOPEFULLY WILL WEED
OUT THIS TYPE OF IGNORANCE
BECAUSE THE STEMS FROM
IGNORANCE.
ITSES INSENSITIVITY TO A REALLY
DARK TIME IN AMERICA THAT
UNFORTUNATELY IS NOW
EXPERIENCING A REEMERGENCE
BUT IF I WERE AN EDUCATOR ON
THAT CAMPUS AND I FOUND OUT THAT
THE STUDENTS ARE DOING THIS, OH,
OKAY, I'M GOING TO EMPHASIZE
CERTAIN THINGS IN MY CURRICULUM
FOR THE REST OF THE SEMESTER.
IF YOU THINK THIS IS CUTE AND
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY,
LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT
LYNCHINGS.
A REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT
AMERICA'S HISTORY BECAUSE
THE FUNNY THING IS,
CONSERVATIVES ARGUE THAT
LIBERAL INDOCTRINATION ON SCHOOL
CAMPUSES.
REALLY, BECAUSE OF THEIR WERE
LIBERAL INDOCTRINATION AND
THESE LIBERAL EDUCATORS WERE AS
EFFECTIVE AS YOU THINK THEY
WERE, DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD
THINK THIS IS A JOKE?
IF ANYTHING, I THINK THAT WE
HAVE MOVED SO FAR BEHIND
EFFECTIVE HISTORY EDUCATION,
SOCIAL STUDIES EDUCATION.
IT IS DEVASTATING.
THESE KIDS DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE DOING.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
DOING.
BUT THEY SHOULD.
THAT'S THE THING.
LET'S HAVE A REFRESHER.
AN ACTUAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED DURING THE CIVIL WAR.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHARING MY
OPINION.
WHO CARES ABOUT MY OPINION?
LET'S TALK ABOUT ACTUAL FACTS.
WHAT THIS COUNTRY WENT THERE
BECAUSE I GUESS A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN.
IT JUST GOES BACK TO THE
UNAMBIGUOUS, THE LACK OF
AMBIGUITY OF HOODS AND BURNING
CROSSES.
I GET IT.
I GET THE FRUSTRATION.
YOU WANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION
BETWEEN GANG MEMBERS AND A CLAN?
IT'S THE SAME WORD.
