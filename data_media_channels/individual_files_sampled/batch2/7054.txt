Mitch McConnell was recently confronted in a restaurant with his wife by some angry protesters so this happened at a popular Cuban restaurant in Louisville Kentucky take a look I'm gonna sell it to tansy they also I don't think you saw it there but that somebody also went on to throw out his food and there were multiple people who came up and basically yelled at him and I'm curious what you guys think about this because I have to say um I have very mixed feelings and I feel like on all these similar stories I have very mixed feelings so recently happened with Ted Cruz where Ted Cruz was in a restaurant with his wife and you know you had the protesters basically shout him down and shout him out of the restaurant now on the one hand I think it's definitely fair to say that the people who are doing the shouting I mean that is literally free speech like you're allowed to go up to somebody and scream at them obviously you shouldn't do any physical assault that's illegal that should be illegal I think we all agree to that but I don't know because I feel like what if in these situations it actually works in the sense that it makes their voting records 5% less terrible and that can make a real difference in people's lives now on the flip side let's not pretend that this doesn't make people look kind of unhinged especially if somebody's watching this and they don't happen to know how terrible of a person and a politician Mitch McConnell is I feel like a casual viewer could look at this and be like well obviously the left is so unhinged and dumb and wrong and this is not how we should be you know fighting back so I don't know I'm curious what you guys think I've always had mixed feelings on this kind of stuff yeah let me just preface this by saying that I will always disagree with anything that gets physical including throwing his leftovers out on the sidewalk that's unacceptable don't touch him don't touch his food don't touch his property that's when you lose me 100% now with that said I've asked myself several times how I would feel if people were shouting at me based on my political opinions and if I would feel comfortable advocating for someone you know yelling at Mitch McConnell or Trump or any of the other goons like what I feel comfortable with them doing that to these elected officials if I'm not comfortable with someone shouting at me based on my political views but we were just a politican had plenty of people show us a little and here's the thing it is free speech and they're allowed to do that and I believe that as Americans we should be allowed to voice our concerns toward these elected officials and so I have no problem with someone raising their voice at a Mitch McConnell or any politician if they believe that this politician has done something divisive has done something that has actually ruined the lives of certain Americans whatever it is you should you have a protection a constitutional protection to be able to do that and if you can't handle it maybe it's time to rethink your political ideology do you think it's effective though cuz that's one of the core things that I'm stuck on is I don't know if it's effective or if maybe it might even make it worse I don't know yeah so I've you gonna be shocked to find out strong opinions about this but it's nuanced and then there's different lines in different places so first of all I agree and I'm amused there that the right-wing who are claimed to be free speech absolutist will then turn around and say a mob it's a mob I can't believe they're speaking freely let's note that irony and move forward so in terms of what the ground rules should be if we're making ground rules one is I'm with Ana on yelling is OK from time to time I'm gonna explain what I think are the important caveat but that happens to me all the time not just at pilota Khan but I'll be walking down the street in New York or I'll be at an airport and some guy will yell at the top of his lungs alright and if you want to like scream obscenities in the middle of an airport that's on you brother okay and it doesn't bother me at all I'm actually slightly amused by it so I think that's okay I think for a politician it's even more okay but so where are the lines first of all I think everyone should agree to Anna's lines nothing physical ever so to me two places where this guy is clearly out of bounds and this is a second guy there was actually an earlier protester as well talking about him in a sec or her this guy went out of bounds by bang his fist on their table and I think that crosses the line and later they had to go food leftover so they were gonna take home and he grabbed it and threw it on the sidewalk no no don't touch their stuff okay and and value leftovers okay I know I okay so and then the third part of it I think or second depending on Howard County is there has to be some time limit to it okay if you're stalking someone and you keep following them it then it gets concerning right so and for me and then some people will disagree with this don't go to their house I think that that's really dangerous I think it's a bad idea there's plenty of unhinge people mainly on the right but there could be some on the left and I don't want anybody at anybody's houses okay that's that's crazy even if you ask me I think that's crazy talk okay so in terms of the the time period look i'm morales jones at an airport stalked Bernie Sanders for about 20 minutes okay you made your point Alex but as usual you're unhinged and then we start to worry about its security because you won't leave him alone somebody who stalked me at politican and it was a bounds of reason waiting for hours and hours what are you gonna do why you know so if you're following Mitch McConnell or Elizabeth Warren I mean you always kind of think show on the other foot right if you said something Elizabeth Warren at an airport I got no problems with that you follow her around for 15 minutes that's an issue okay it that's my take on it and I know that this sometimes it could be a little bit of a vague line but we got to keep things under control and cannot let them be physical on the other hand real quick and I've said this before the reason we're having this situation is because of money in politics and you might think like what are you talking about Mitch McConnell will not talk to Issa in his home state of Kentucky you will not talk to any constituent from Kentucky unless they have a big fat check form and so when you create a situation where you cannot reach your own representatives unless you're willing to bribe them well at some point the dams gonna burst and you're gonna be having some nice Cuban food and a woman and a guy in two separate occasions are going to come up and yell at you because you've left them no recourse and that is particular to politicians yeah here's why I think this is a really tough issue I just want to give people who might not know some more information on Mitch McConnell so they understand because that anger even though it might look at face value irrational almost is actually I think perfectly rational because Mitch McConnell is a guy who for example he was for a constitutional ban on gay marriage he supported every outsourcing deal including NAFTA and GATT he voted no on bringing cheaper drugs into this country he supported repealing Obamacare cutting Social Security Medicare Medicaid he voted YES on warrantless NSA spying with the Patriot Act he supports Guantanamo Bay and torture he voted to eliminate the estate tax so he supported the Iraq war in the Afghanistan war and but here's my ultimate conclusion and why this will always be a tough issue for me is that to look at the two most extreme examples that I could come up with so if I see somebody yelling at Dick Cheney in an airport screaming about the Iraq war the fact he has blood on his hands and he ordered torture and all that stuff yes part of me is gonna go go get him absolutely it's such a terrible guy but then again we have to argue based on principles as well and if I saw somebody who is yelling at Bernie Sanders in an airport I'd be like oh why are you doing that so I just you know I'm just I think I'm always gonna wobble on this issue I think it's a tough issue yeah well I think everybody agrees it's a tough issue well of course some see the world is completely black and white on on both sides but so I want to talk about the earlier woman and so the one person recorded the the second guy that you all just saw there and and they were clearly the most honest person in the room because they said i'ma sell this to TMZ and then you saw the giant TMZ sign on the video so apparently delivered on that promise okay but Todd Berta and Casey leaked they're partners and and they were at the diner as well it's just great to see a married couple in Kentucky it's that a two guys and and like oh that's Mitch McConnell and then but they were a little I got the sense from Adam and put too many words in their mouths a little disconcerted at the at the volume right which was a cos point if you're losing the gay couple next door with your screaming then you to calibrate to see if that's the right way to approach the issue although your anger is incredibly justifiable based on the list that that Kyle read and that list could go on and on oh yeah anyway the first woman was also screaming apparently at the top of her lungs and I liked what she said though she said you're a traitor to this country she said to Mitch McConnell and over and over told him how he was ruining the country and then after she left she went up to the window and gave him a double middle finger now and then the next guy again went a little out of bounds to say the least on the banging of the fists on the table etc and and in that video it looks like the crowd is mainly telling him not to do it according to witnesses it was mixed some were saying hey cut that out and some were saying were applauding when both of them yelled at Mitch McConnell so another interesting note and that is that they're bringing a lose Kentucky that is an interesting point one other thing that I just want to bring up and quickly mention I hate when people start to nitpick political activism and more importantly protest right because the whole point of protest is not meant to be based on the framing or the terms of the person who's being protested protests are not meant to be convenient by definition protests are supposed to make these politicians or elected officials feel uncomfortable and so once you and again look I think that there are some ground rules that do make sense you don't want to get physical you don't want to do anything that could be considered assault I agree with you on the stalking thing although I think 15 minutes isn't really that long but I don't want to start nitpicking people who have been so frustrated at a political system that hasn't worked for them and elected officials who haven't looked out for them I don't want to nitpick them and tell them they're wrong when they finally get an opportunity to voice their concerns yeah look the First Amendment meant to protect offensive speech you don't have to bother protecting perfectly pleasant speech no one's against that and it's actually a point that the right wing makes often when they want to say things that are racist bigoted etc and they say hey that's what the First Amendment protects yeah okay that's fair but the First Amendment really protects us as well I mean he protects it in two parts not just in freedom of speech but also being able to seek a redress of your grievances from the government that's the Senate Majority Leader it doesn't get any more government than Mitch McConnell by the way his dining partner his wife is Elaine Chao the transportation secretary so you could not find a more government table in the whole country than that table if you wanted to get a you know to cite your grievances and that is what they did and in a sense that's the most constitutional thing you could possibly do yeah democracy is messy and that's Monocacy we just saw democracy yeah so unless super lest this look whatever you think of the bounds and the rules that we just stated and whether you agree or disagree with them one thing I think we can agree to is that the right wing talking point that when they say racist stuff it's awesome free speech but when the left wing says something it's a mob is absolutely
