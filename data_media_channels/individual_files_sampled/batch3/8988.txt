DOOCY IS LIVE WITH THAT. THIS RACE IS PRETTY INTERESTING. PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT ENDORSE ONE CANDIDATE. HE ACTUALLY ENDORSED TWO PEOPLE. HE WROTE THIS ON TWITTER, "TO THE GREAT PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA WE HAVE TOGETHER A REALLY GREAT CHANCE TO KEEP MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE. THE PROBLEM IS, DON BLANKENSHIP CURRENTLY RUNNING FOR SENATE, CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN YOUR STATE. NO WAY. REMEMBER ALABAMA. VOTE JENKINS OR A.G. MORRISEY." CONGRESSMAN PATTY JENKINS WHO GOT HALF OF THE CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS GOT HALF THE SHOUT OUT IS GRATEFUL FOR WHAT HE CALLS A "SHOUT-OUT." WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE MOMENTUM AND WE ARE EXCITED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE US A SHOUTOUT THIS MORNING. WE FEEL REALLY GOOD. WE HAD ACTUALLY TODAY A WHOLE GROUP OF THE TRUMP DELEGATES TO THE NATIONAL CONVENTION ANNOUNCE THEIR SUPPORT FOR MY CANDIDACY. WE ARE ON THE MOVE, WE ARE ON THE HOME STRETCH. WE WILL WIN TOMORROW. BUT BLANKENSHIP TELLS US THAT HE REJECTS THE PRESIDENT'S COMPARISON THERE TO ALABAMA'S FAILED SENATE CANDIDATE JUDGE ROY MOORE. HE IS GETTING BAD INFORMATION. MY ACCUSERS IS HILLARY CLINTON, AND BARACK OBAMA. NOT YOUNG WOMEN. I THINK HE IS GETTING THE WRONG STORY. MITCH McCONNELL DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE IN THE SENATE BECAUSE HE KNOWS I BELIEVE WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP THERE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP. BLANKENSHIP DID GO TO JAIL FOR A YEAR ON A CONVICTION FOR CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE MINE SAFETY LAWS. BECAUSE HE IS STILL ON PROBATION, A THIRD CANDIDATE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PATRICK MORRISEY IS POINTING OUT THAT BLANKENSHIP FILED A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND TO SEE WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN, HE CALLED BLANKENSHIP'S PROBATION OFFICER. MY CAMPAIGN WILL BE INFORMING HIS PROBATION OFFICER IN NEVADA ABOUT THIS ISSUE RIGHT AWAY TO DETERMINE IF THIS REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL LAW VIOLATES THE TERMS OF THE SUPERVISED RELEASE. THE PROBATION OFFICER APPARENTLY GOT NOTIFIED TODAY. BUT BLANKENSHIP TELLS ME THAT HE ALREADY GAVE THE P.O. A HEADS UP AND HE LAUGHED AT THE CHARGE THAT A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE NOT YET FILED COULD POSSIBLY DISQUALIFY HIM OR GET HIM ARRESTED. HE SAYS THE P.O. COMPARED IT TO A LATE CREDIT CARD PAYMENT.
