WE NOW CALL IT SPYGATE. YOU ARE CALLING IT SPYGATE. A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. I WANT THEM ALL TO GET TOGETHER. THEY WILL SIT IN THE ROOM. HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT AMONG THEMSELVES. WE ARE NOT UNDERCUTTING. WE'RE CLEANING EVERYTHING UP. WHAT I WANT IS TOTAL TRANSPARENCY. ANY MEETING BETWEEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON CAPITOL HILL ABOUT SUCH INFORMATION SHOULD ONLY BE ATTENDED BY MEMBERS OF THE GANG OF EIGHT. I DON'T CARE WHO COMES. I AM NOT IN CONTROL OF THE INVITE LIST. Bret: WELL, THIS MEETING IS GOING FORWARD. WE MENTIONED IN EARLIER WITH JOHN ROBERTS. THE MEETING TOMORROW WILL INCLUDE THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES. HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN TREY GOWDY. FBI DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR AND ACTING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. ALL OF THOSE WILL BE AT THE MEETING AT THE DOJ ABOUT THE CLASSIFIED ELEMENTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. WE ARE BEING TOLD THERE WILL LIKELY BE ANOTHER MEETING WITH THE GANG OF EIGHT, THE BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS. POSSIBLY AFTER THE MEMORIAL DAY RECESS. WE WILL START THERE WITH ALL OF THIS INVESTIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATION. JOINING ME IN LOS ANGELES, STEVE HILTON, FORMER ADVISOR TO BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON AND HOST OF "THE NEXT REVOLUTION." LESLIE MARSHALL, SYNDICATED TALK RADIO HOST. IN WASHINGTON, MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT OF NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO. MATTHEW CONTINUITY, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF "THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON." STEVE, YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS IS COMING OUT AND SIGNIFICANCE. IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT THE LEFT AND PARTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA, "THE NEW YORK TIMES," WERE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT WE NOW DESCRIBE AS A DEEP STATE. WE HAD JAMES CLAPPER GOING TO CONGRESS AND LYING ABOUT SURVEILLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE IS A SUSPICION OF THE SECURITY SERVICES AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. NOW THAT THEY SEEM TO BE AGAINST ROME, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THEY ARE PURE THAN PURE. THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE ARE SUFFICIENT REASONS TO THINK THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT THOUGHT THAT THE PROSPECT OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WAS UNTHINKABLE, UNACCEPTABLE, AND TOOK STEPS TO TRY TO STOP IT. THERE'S ENOUGH SUSPICION THERE TO THINK THAT WE REALLY DO NEED A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO THE INVESTIGATION AND RUSSIAN MEDDLING, WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT, TO LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL OF DEEP STATE MEDDLING. Bret: MARA, ARE YOU CALLING IT SPYGATE? THE PRESIDENT IS HAPPY THAT HE HAS BRANDED SOMETHING NEW. HE HAS COME UP WITH SPYGATE. HE SAID YOU ARE CALLING IT SPYGATE. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT. HE SAID IT COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE, A SPY, AS HE CALLS IT, EMBEDDED IN HIS CAMPAIGN FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES TO SPY ON THE CAMPAIGN. SO FAR THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN FBI INFORMANT WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN FBI INFORMANT WHO MET WITH CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN, REACHED OUT TO THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT CONTACTS THEY HAD WITH RUSSIANS. BUT IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO, HE CAN DECLASSIFY ANY PIECE OF INFORMATION HE WANTS. HE COULD HAVE ASKED ANY OF HIS INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS OR MONTHS TO SAY TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW. WAS THERE A SPY EMBEDDED IN MY CAMPAIGN? I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW. I THINK HE WANTS TO KEEP THE STORY GOING. IT'S A GOOD NARRATIVE FOR HIM AND IT HELPS HIM UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIM AND HIS CAMPAIGN. Bret: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, LESLIE, THE JARED KUSHNER GETTING SECURITY CLEARANCE TODAY FINALLY AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. NATIONAL SECURITY LAW ATTORNEY TOLD US "THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT. THE BUREAU WOULD'VE HAD VERY SENIOR PEOPLE ON THIS IN THE MATTER WOULD'VE BEEN REVIEWED AND APPROVED OF THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS. THIS DECISION WILL BE HIGHLY VETTED AND CONSIDERED. THEY WOULDN'T BE DEEMING HIM ELIGIBLE FOR ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED MATERIALS NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL OF CLEARANCE IF THERE WERE ANY OUTSTANDING COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONCERNS WHATSOEVER." ONE PERSON'S ASSESSMENT. YOUR THOUGHTS. I DON'T THINK JARED KUSHNER IS THE PROBLEM. I THINK THE PRESIDENT AND HIS RHETORIC ARE THE PROBLEM AND IT'S CAUSED A PROBLEM NOT ONLY FOR HIS SON-IN-LAW BUT THAT TENSION WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE RHETORIC TOWARD THE FBI AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FOR THE CONSTITUTION. WHEN WE GO BACK TO MARA'S POINTS, WHEN YOU CALL THE SPYGATE, AND I'M NOT CALLING IT SPYGATE. I WANT TO GO ON THE RECORD. Bret: I DON'T THINK WE HAVE CALLED IT SPYGATE. LET'S SPEAK ABOUT SPYGATE, IF WE WILL. THE RULE OF THE FBI, ANYBODY, EVEN IF THEY WORKED FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, THIS GENTLEMAN ALL THE WAY BACK TO RONALD REAGAN, IS TO DO EXACTLY THIS BREEDS TO SAY THERE'VE BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. PAUL MANAFORT HAS BEEN INDICTED. PAUL MANAFORT IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SPOKEN TO AND TO MARA'S POINT, THE PRESIDENT HAS THE POWER TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS A SPY EMBEDDED, IF THERE TRULY WAS SPYGATE. THIS IS DEFLECTION. WHY DEFLECT FROM THE MUELLER SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION IF THERE IS NOTHING TO HIDE. Bret: BOTH THINGS ARE GOING FORWARD. WE ALWAYS SAY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE ARE COVERING BOTH SIDES. THE REASON I BRING UP THE JARED KUSHNER THING IS HOW THAT WAS COVERED EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS SUGGESTED THAT BECAUSE OF ALL THE FOREIGN CONTACTS AND ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT JARED KUSHNER THAT THERE WAS NO WAY HE WAS GOING TO GET SECURITY CLEARANCE AND SOMEHOW HE COULD BE CHARGED OR INDICTED. THAT WAS THE COVERAGE AND THE SPECULATION. NOW HE'S CLEARED. AS A FORMER OFFICIAL TOLD CATHERINE HERRIDGE IN HER REPORT, THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT THOSE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONCERNS NO LONGER EXIST. IF HE HAD BEEN GRANTED THE SECURITY CLEARANCE. I LIKE TO QUOTE DONALD RUMSFELD. THERE ARE SO MANY KNOWN UNKNOWNS. THE INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATION. COMING FROM CONGRESS AS MUCH AS DONALD TRUMP IS PUBLICIZING IT AND AIDING IT, THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW DID THIS START. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT UNKNOWNS. ONE OF THE GREAT KNOWN UNKNOWNS, RATHER. WHILE HE WAS THE ORIGINAL ORDER THAT DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROSENSTEIN GAVE TO ROBERT MUELLER? WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL DETAILS. WE ALSO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS OTHER BRITISH PROFESSOR WHO MET WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS. HE HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC IN MONTHS. THE KNOWN UNKNOWNS CONTINUE TO MOUNT. Bret: MARA, WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS GOES? I DON'T KNOW. WE KNOW WHAT RUDY GIULIANI SAYS, THAT IT WILL BE DONE BY SEPTEMBER. MUELLER WILL BE DONE BY SEPTEMBER. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY TWIST AND TURN, WE DON'T KNOW THE BIG PICTURE. BOB MUELLER ISN'T TALKING, TO HIS CREDIT. WE ARE COVERING THIS THROUGH A STRAW AND EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE THE BIGGEST DEAL. I WOULD SAY THE BOTTOM LINE TO ME FOR TODAY FOR JARED KUSHNER, THIS WAS A GOOD DAY FOR JARED KUSHNER AND A GOOD WEEK FOR JARED KUSHNER BECAUSE HE STARTED WORKING ON A SUBSTANTIVE POLICY THAT HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN CONGRESS COMMAND THAT HIS PRISON
