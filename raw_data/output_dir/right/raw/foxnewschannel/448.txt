1
00:00:00,283 --> 00:00:00,850

00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,054
>> Neil: LET'S GET A READ ON

5
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:05,521
ALL OF THIS.

6
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:06,656
YOU MAY NOT THINK THE HOUSE

7
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,957
HAS ANY SAY BUT INFLUENCE

8
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:09,392
AND SENTIMENT AT THE

9
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:10,460
GRASSROOTS LEVEL HOW THIS IS

10
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,862
ALL GOING DOWN.

11
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,231
DAN KILDEE JOINS US NOW.

12
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:17,567
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:18,468
>> Neil: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:21,104
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE WHERE

15
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:23,840
MICHIGAN MIC

16
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:19,836
MITCIGAN MIC

17
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:23,873
THIS WAS GOING.

18
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:24,674
MITCHGAN MIC

19
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,042
MCCONNELL WAS SAYING GET THE

20
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,076
INVESTIGATION GOING AND FBI

21
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:28,378
ON IT.

22
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:29,846
THEY WILL MOVE THE GOAL POST

23
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,247
AND DEADLINE AND START

24
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,081
COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING.

25
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,216
YOU SNANCHTS I THINK THERE

26
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:34,050
ARE A LOT OF SENATORS WHO

27
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,618
HAVE MADE THEIR MINDS UP AND

28
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,821
OUGHT NOT FOCUS ON THEM.

29
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:38,722
HANDFUL OF SENATORS WHO

30
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:39,522
ACTUALLY COULD BENEFIT FROM

31
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,191
THE INFORMATION THAT THIS

32
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,459
INVESTIGATION MIGHT REVEAL.

33
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,127
SO, RATHER THAN FOCUSING

34
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,829
ONLY ON HOW QUICKLY THE

35
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,197
PROCESS MOVES, OR WHETHER

36
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:48,431
THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY MADE

37
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,833
UP THEIR MINDS CAN EITHER

38
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,903
CRITICIZE THE PROCESS OR

39
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:54,437
CONFIRM IT.

40
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:56,039
LEAVE UP THE POSSIBILITY

41
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,806
THAT INFORMATION WILL BE

42
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,475
REVEALED THAT WILL EITHER

43
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,776
CONFIRM OR SOMEHOW NEGATE

44
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,646
THE CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN

45
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,079
MADE.

46
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,513
THERE ARE HANDFUL OF

47
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:05,447
SENATORS OHIO THINK ACTUALLY

48
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:06,616
WANT THAT INFORMATION.

49
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:09,052
THAT MAY SEEM A LITTLE

50
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:09,419
POLYANNA.

51
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:10,553
WHEN YOU TOOK JEFF FLAKE'S

52
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:11,688
COMMENTS AT FACE VALUE.

53
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:12,856
THAT HE WANTED TO KNOW MORE

54
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:14,257
AND HE FELT LIKE HE NEEDED

55
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:15,525
TO KNOW MORE.

56
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:16,760
LET'S LEAVE OPEN THE

57
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,661
POSSIBILITY THAT THE FBI,

58
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,764
WHICH CLEARLY CAN GET AN

59
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:21,831
EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION DONE

60
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:26,303
IN THE 7-DAY TIME PERIOD.

61
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:27,037
>> Neil: YOU WOULD PROBABLY

62
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,371
BE CONCERNED IF IT RAPID UP

63
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:28,738
TOMORROW?

64
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:30,040
>> IF THEY INTERVIEWED 24

65
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,275
PEOPLE AND ABLE TO

66
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:33,677
SYNTHESIZE THAT INFORMATION,

67
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,045
THE DATE ISN'T SO IMPORTANT.

68
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:35,779
THIS IS A LIFETIME

69
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:36,179
APPOINTMENT.

70
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,183
WE OUGHT TO GET IT RIGHT.

71
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:40,884
>> Neil: FRIDAY DATE TO GET

72
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:42,118
IT DONE.

73
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,687
WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL WAS

74
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,422
SAYING MOOD OF THE HOUSE AND

75
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:46,523
THE MOOD IN THE SENATE.

76
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,624
GOING TO BE A BIG ELECTION

77
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:48,225
YEAR ISSUE.

78
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:49,292
GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE IN

79
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:49,893
FIVE WEEKS.

80
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:50,761
DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE?

81
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,928
WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR

82
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,130
CONSTITUENTS, DO THEY SAY

83
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,898
THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO ME HOW

84
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:55,365
THIS THING GOES?

85
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,767
>> I THINK THERE ARE SOME

86
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:58,001
PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT FEEL

87
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,937
THAT IF THIS CONFIRMATION

88
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,672
WERE RAMMED THROUGH AND

89
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:03,940
THERE WERE UNANSWERED

90
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,475
QUESTIONS, THEY MIGHT HOLD

91
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,810
SOME SENATORS RESPONSIBLE

92
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,377
FOR THAT.

93
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,812
BUT I THINK GENERALLY

94
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:09,847
SPEAKING, IN SOMETHING LIKE

95
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:10,479
THIS.

96
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,416
A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AS

97
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,550
HARD AS IT MIGHT SEEM IT IS

98
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,152
TO DO THIS, WE JUST NEED TO

99
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:16,587
SET ASIDE THE ELECTORAL

100
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:19,823
IMPACT AND JUST GET IT DONE.

101
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:20,457
>> Neil: IT'S INTERESTING

102
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,625
TWO DIFFERENT POLLS OUT.

103
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,759
REPUBLICANS BY AND LARGE

104
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,861
THINK REPUBLICANS ARE DOING

105
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:25,329
A GOOD JOB WITH IT DEMOCRATS

106
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,164
BY AND LARGE THINK DEMOCRATS

107
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:28,932
ARE DOING A GOOD JOB TRYING

108
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:30,868
TO FIGHT THIS.

109
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:31,935
IS IT GOVERNMENT THE WAY YOU

110
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,270
LIKE TO SEE IT FUNCTION?

111
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,872
>> NO, NO.

112
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,640
I'M REALLY TIRED OF THIS.

113
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,775
YOU KNOW.

114
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:38,776
>> Neil: SOME OF YOUR

115
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,943
COLLEAGUES, YOU KNOW, TALKED

116
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,278
ABOUT WE ARE NOT EVEN DONE

117
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:42,579
WITH THIS EVEN IF HE MAKES

118
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,380
IT TO THE COURT.

119
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,115
LOOK FOR WAYS TO GETTING HIM

120
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,417
OFF THE COURT IS THAT

121
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:46,817
PRODUCTIVE.

122
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:47,651
>> DEPENDS ON WHAT THE

123
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,385
INFORMATION REVEALS.

124
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,753
I'M NOT SURE HOW PRODUCTIVE

125
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,054
IT IS.

126
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:51,855
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

127
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,290
FAULT FACTS AND I THINK WE

128
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:53,757
OUGHT TO DO IT.

129
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,025
THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS AS

130
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,027
THOUGH ON EVERY QUESTION THE

131
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:59,797
PARTIES RETREAT TO THEIR

132
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:01,899
POLLS, AND HOLD ON TO THOSE

133
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:02,866
POSITIONS RATHER THAN JUST

134
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,268
ALLOW THE PROCESS TO MOVE

135
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,402
FORWARD, TAKE THE

136
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:05,970
INFORMATION, MAKE A

137
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,738
JUDGMENT, THIS IS A LIFETIME

138
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:08,639
APPOINTMENT, WE OUGHT TO DO

139
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,306
IT RIGHT.

140
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,575
WE OUGHT TO GET IT DONE.

141
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,276
>> Neil: SIR, WHILE I HAVE

142
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,711
GOT YOU HERE.

143
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:14,879
BIG INDUSTRIAL STATE.

144
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,180
IMPORTANT STATE, MICHIGAN.

145
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,581
THE PRESIDENT GETTING THE

146
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:22,620
CANADIANS ON THIS COURT.

147
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,855
AT JUST THE 11TH HOUR.

148
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:27,892
AND I'M WONDERING, HE HAS TO

149
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:28,592
GET CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT

150
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:30,094
FOR THIS WHICH PRESUMABLY

151
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:30,928
WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THE MID

152
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:31,896
TERMS SO WE COULD HAVE A

153
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:32,797
DIFFERENT MAKEUP IN THE

154
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:33,964
HOUSE AND HAVE A DIFFERENT

155
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,399
MAKEUP IN THE SENATE.

156
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,867
AND I'M TOLD THAT THIS IS

157
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,070
VERY WORKER FRIENDLY,

158
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,971
ACTUALLY UNION FRIENDLY SO

159
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,672
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE AN

160
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,641
EASIER TIME WITH YOU GUYS,

161
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,709
DEMOCRATS, THAN HE WOULD

162
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,443
REPUBLICANS IS, THAT TRUE?

163
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:46,310
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.

164
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,946
I MEAN, THE CHANGE WITH THE

165
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:49,947
SO-CALLED RULES OF ORIGIN

166
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:52,483
COULD ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL.

167
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,251
>> Neil: IN OTHER WORDS, HOW

168
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:54,685
MUCH IS NORTH AMERICAN.

169
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,455
>> RIGHT, GOES TO 75% WHICH

170
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:58,522
COULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT

171
00:03:58,522 --> 00:03:58,889
DIRECTION.

172
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,992
FOR ME THE DAIRY PROVISIONS

173
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,994

PRODUCER, MILK PRODUCERS

175
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:04,629
ESPECIALLY COULD BE

176
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:04,996
IMPORTANT.

177
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,131
THE PIECE WE NEED TO KNOW

178
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,367
MORE ABOUT IS WHAT THOSE

179
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,836
LABOR PROVISIONS LOOK LIKE

180
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,471
AND LABOR MECHANISM IS ONE

181
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,039
PIECE AND SECONDLY OUR

182
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,474
CONSIDERATION OF THIS NEW

183
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:17,274
AGREEMENT, WHICH I CAN'T

184
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:19,677
COME UP WITH THE NAME OF IT

185
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,680
YET IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

186
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,549
NAFTA.

187
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:25,583
>> Neil: THE US MEXICO

188
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,250
CANADA AGREEMENT.

189
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,418
>> OUR CONSIDERATION WILL BE

190
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,021
IN PART TRIGGERED BY MEXICAN

191
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:30,988
GOVERNMENT ACTION AND I NEED

192
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,257
TO KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO

193
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:33,558
LOOK LIKE.

194
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:34,359
MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE IN

195
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,294
ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS

196
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:37,829

197
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,197
AND WORKER WRITES AND WAGES

199
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,699

00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,074
YET, THEN I THINK WE COULD

206
00:04:50,074 --> 00:00:00,000
SEE THIS THING MOVE FORWARD,
