00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
hey everyone a few years ago back when

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,629
my room was still blue in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> pet dragon</font>

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,370
was still with me I made a video the

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,960
video was ostensibly about the killers

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> why pop culture was important but</font>

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,410
really what I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,630
how much i love the killers I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,089
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain why I loved them so much I</font>

9
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,830
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to explain why I love them</font>

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,720
so much I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failed saying anything</font>

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,670
explaining and reasoning and questioning

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,439
and justifying and trying things out and

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,880
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> for things that's the way I</font>

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">function</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do or the reasoning stuff and</font>

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,019
I also do all the practical stuff and

16
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,789
that's how I work this that's just how I

17
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,619
operate around the world probably not

18
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,480
that rare or unique a thing to do but

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,309
the killer's there is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> explanation no</font>

20
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,290
carefully constructed owed to the

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,570
excellence of them in the face of such

22
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,550
explanation there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this oh good this</font>

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,620
is restricted to music as a medium and

24
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> killers as an artist with books I</font>

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,190
will happily chat to someone with a

26
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,920
massive open mind someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who hates book</font>

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,020
that I love and I'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> their opinion</font>

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">into genuine account and I'll think</font>

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,379
critically about it and I'll consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

30
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,969
and i'll place it into what other things

31
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've read and talked about about that</font>
