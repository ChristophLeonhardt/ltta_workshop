put your hands up in the air honey badger don't care what Stacey honey badger don't care oh that's a good honey badger really nice so there's this notion you might have heard about it called honey badger don't care honey badger approaches and fights anything if you go on YouTube and you'll see a thousand videos of honey badgers and African savannah and they fight anything they fight lions tigers any sort of creature you could think of down there they'll approach it and start fighting it even though it's like it's a little ferret looking sort of creature beaver looking creature and it fights whatever so when no matter how horrifying the creature you know a lion looks pretty scary right this guy looks pretty scary yeah you know I've seen photos of those blobfish they from like way down deep thirty thousand feet below and that Charlie Munger is uglier than a blobfish if that's imaginable you know his wife is the one putting in the paper bag on her head you know what this guy he looks like the tapeworm that got hit with an ugly stick Charlie Munger urges regulators to ease off Wells Fargo blasts Bitcoin bad you don't care Charlie Munger here's the Charlie Munger approach to economics tell quacky quacky there you go but you know it worked in rehearsal for you tonight saying this is Charlie Munger's approached economics blow bubbles blow bubbles for Wells Fargo bailout Wells Fargo bailout the terrorists Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett damar age top photo I showed that was from a tweet from Reuters Berkshires monger urges regulators to ease up on Wells Fargo so you know before Janet Yellen another honey badger left the Federal Reserve Bank she did basically force them to replace three of their directors because they themselves were unwilling to be basically get a better attitude about all the frauds they had committed you know they had set up all this fake accounts for their clients in order to basically meet some targets and get better bonuses but they had also been found and this kind of good overlooks because it happened this summer when a lot of fake Russia Gate stories were happening but also Bitcoin started to take off so that got more press but they had also been found to have basically forced auto loans auto insurance onto those who had auto loans from them and it was fraudulent that basically these people didn't need this product and then they didn't realize that they had this product and so they ended up getting their cars repossessed so basically Janet Yellen forced them to that was on a very last day she forced them to replace their directors and now Charlie Munger is all upset that as the largest shareholder of Wells Fargo he's using his position to try to badger honey badger the you know the the regulators to ease up on his investment Yeah right he's the largest shareholder he and Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway Wells Fargo Wells Fargo was caught and equivocally stealing from millions of customers Wells Fargo you know going back a few years you know they've been involved in numerous scams they got bailed out of course during the 2008 crisis out of that crisis emerged Bitcoin a self-regulating true money a substitute that would put the Charlie Munger's and warren buffett's under the bus because there are parasites that just take from the cut from the economy without adding anything Berkshire Hathaway adds nothing to the economy it extracts from the economy it's a tapeworm on the economy Bitcoin is sound money so naturally it's like throwing tears at the Wicked Witch the West in this case Charlie Munger is the Wicked Witch of the West and Bitcoin are the tears actually called Bitcoin a noxious poison which it is exactly it is you put poison down to you know get rid of rats who are eating infesting your house and here they've the these sort of this banking activity which by the way the activity that Wells Fargo was engaged in opening from industrial-scale fraud that's what it was and they got fined a bit of money like two hundred million dollars for opening these fraudulent accounts he says of course Wells Fargo had incentive systems this is what they call it incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction and of course they were too slow and reacting properly to bad news but practically everyone makes those kinds of mistakes monger said and as Bitcoin wishes the noxious poison and it is the noxious poison to this sort of system this fraudulent system which is opaque you can't see it that these people until years later that these people have been committing industrial scale fraud and then the regulators come in and they tap them on their little wrists and nothing happens well Bitcoin destroys that well they keep 90 cents every fraud dollar they commit they pay 10 cents in fine and charlie munger saying the incentives are out of whack it's miss incentivized a way that the structure of the banking work bank to work is true across the banking sector it's true across the central banking sector it's how Charlie Munger's made money when when he and Warren Buffett called Bitcoin the rat poison that's correct and he is the rat Charlie Munger is a 94 year old rat Warren Buffett is a big fat rat they are eaters they're predators right and this just characterized fraud that's Miss incentive that's like saying that you know the guy who goes into the liquor store and Rob's it blind and kills people he was miss incentivized he just went in there to get a pack of cigarettes but it's somehow his incentive structure was messed up and he ended up killing a few people and stealing a bunch of money but was just gonna find him 10% of the money he stole he stole a thousand bucks he's got to give a hundred dollars to the government as a fine he can keep nine hundred there's no culpability for the murders in this case these guys are actually causing wide-scale social and economic unrest that's leading to all kinds of malaise and destruction in the economy and deaths he is the Pol Pot private-equity well this is the thing about the wells-fargo scandals first of all let me conclude with what Reuters says about it look listen to their wording about this the San francisco-based Bank has been beset by scandals for deceiving customers such as by opening unauthorized accounts and forcing them to take out auto insurance they did not need so the thing that cannot be calculated is how much stress it caused some of these people remember there were something like 20,000 car repossessions that happened because of this that goes on their credit scores how do you fix the credit scores of these people and here's an economy where literally if you don't have credit in the US economy you're you're dead you're you know here's like you're cut off from the grid so there's no way to calculate how much damage that has done so you know these are Charlie Munger is a frustrated Jenna saddle mania and he knows he's not long for this world so he's spending the last few weeks of his life of essentially thumbing his nose that everyone has tried to apply the rule of law to this recidivist criminal banking terrorist that has murdered people indirectly by abusing the system and it's a shame that the media in America waste his time pointing the finger at countries involved in throwing elections where there's absolutely nothing but smoke to it and they ignore somebody inside the country who's actually destroying lives they go oh we don't care about that because he's he plays ukulele with his buddy Warren and they're so sweet how bad can they be there's such a nice old gentleman you know meanwhile you know there's a lot of people in Paraguay and elsewhere that were involved in all kinds of this story you know there's actually a great piece of the nation which will cover soon but it's a it covers the Berkshire Hathaway business model and what they do is they invest in companies that have monopoly power so they themselves invest in monopoly power which is antithetical to the American ideology of free markets so but they themselves Warren Buffett says he utters these words says that he invests in moats if you have a moat that keeps you from your position is protected your monopoly pricing power he invests in that in terms of what Janet Yellen did on her last day in office here she says a Wells Fargo rehab requires a change at the top last Friday and Janet yellen's last day is Federal Reserve chair the regulator slapped the San francisco-based lender with sanctions for poor governance compliance and risk management relating to abuse of sales practices that culminated in the creation of millions of fake accounts and inappropriate charging of auto insurance and mortgage fees the Fed also took the unprecedented step of prohibiting Wells Fargo from growing any larger than its total asset size at the end of 2017 or two trillion dollars without clearance from the central bank ironically this sanction actually provides an element of cover for the lender which has found growth to be a challenge lately so they're not allowed to expand because they've they they apparently can't do it without committing fraud so Janet Yellen on our last day to actually do something worthwhile and she of course she had to do it on her last day because otherwise Warren Buffett would have had her removed anyway from the Fed exactly the quid pro quo she did on the last day you know putting lipstick on a pig purely for cosmetics window-dressing and they'll overturn it quickly because these people have enormous sway in government and they run the legislative process and they'll be unwound any penalties for Wells Fargo and they'll be back committing serial fraud you know by the second quarter of 2018 we're gonna get into part of the reason why she did this is because you know they've committed these frauds against their customers the fake client to cows and the fake insurance products but they still have an offered restitution but for anybody who was owed less than a hundred dollars so they still have like thousands hundreds of thousands of Americans that they owe restitution to but I do want to say something about honey badger that we have a friend Steve Beauregard who we saw down in Cancun at the Satoshi roundtable he's with go coin and he was just on a safari in Africa and he asked the safari guide he wanted to see where the honey badgers are and the safari guide was like honey badgers usually people want to see the elephants the Lions the Tigers the giraffes like whatever why do you want to see honey badgers and the guy hadn't heard about honey badgers being by the fiercest animal on the Savannah it's the honey badger you know and of course the Charlie Munger's are the Warren Buffett's either they get disintermediated out of existence or they just croak well they both have said they're like they're not long for the world guys well okay so Wells Fargo screws customers yet again now failing to make right and abuses Elizabeth Warren demands answers so Wells Fargo is getting yet more deserved bad press gretchen morgenson and emily glazier of the Wall Street Journal reported that the bank was making a hash of the customer restitution at a promise to make in connection with his various scandals again I hate that they always call everything scandals their crimes like these were crimes they committed but even though the press firestorm last week was over the bank's fake accounts the much bigger payments to customers and the ones that is messing up involved the force placing of auto insurance which in over 20,000 cases led to car repossessions and charging unjustified fees in connection with mortgages the journal's story got the attention of elizabeth warren who shot off a letter to wells fargo CEO Tim Sloan demanding answers again Tim Sloan was made CEO after the previous CEO is forced to step down finally after many months of and all sorts of Senate hearings and finally they forced him down Tim Sloan was the former CFO so he was in charge during all these crimes he was still an executive during all these crimes so Janet Yellen had been basically suggesting that they get some outside help because all that it was infested their entire organization with people who obviously couldn't see what they had done was wrong rats yes so you have to basically bring in a honey badger to take it on right and you know combine that with the opioid crisis so all these people that have had their lives ruined by Wells Fargo of course it's very easy to get hooked on opiates thanks to the drug industry they're working together and it's the American genocide but Charlie Munger doesn't care Johnny badger and coin will however put these guys to rest physically intellectually and metaphorically what sound money and you're your own bank you don't need to rely on these crooks well as you head into the second half were you gonna talk to Randy volar about the 2018 elections coming up these sort of issues are still ongoing this this started in 2008 2009 actually the frauds were committed leading up to the financial I think he actually died of 2008 and he's just emitting the noxious gases from his corpse is being interpreted as some kind of insight well we got to go to the second half a little break don't go away stay right there welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm max geyser time now to turn to four-time mayor of Pittsboro and he also led the North Carolina Democratic Party hey it's Randy baller Randy welcome back to the Kaiser report it's great to be here max okay so we're coming up on 2018 usually the president you know he has a big downward move he gets crushed you know after being in office a bit there's a reversal but this president has caught the eye of some interesting folks you know his tax cuts have led to praise even from democratic-leaning California corporations like Apple our celebrities like Bill Murray you know normally in midterm elections the party in power is kicked in the teeth but these tax cuts seems to have you know really grabbed people attention even in the Democratic Party what do you think well money is always gonna grab people's attention you know we all knew that Apple was off showing all their profits and now when they've lowered the rates from 35 to 21 and some of the other things in that tax bill they're able to move billion tens of billions of dollars around to their benefit the question is what's becoming of a lot of this money I mean what I read in Bloomberg and other sources their corporations are buying their stock back yeah why would they buy the stock back right exactly they're more into financial engineering than to cap X they're not building out they're not growing their businesses as such they're just engaged in accounting tricks to increase the executives pay more exactly because of the legislation passed in the Clinton administration which capped which you could write off they get these stock options so I predicted they would do the Hat last fall and they're buying a lot of stock backs so of course you know Apple is happy because they had hundreds of billions of dollars caught up in this or at least tens of billions and very wealthy people are happy and anyone that has an S corp is happy because they change the rules there and if you had an s corporate ax rate went to 21% so 2018 no I mean this is all you know playing well to the crowd yes so Democratic Party you were great kind of laying out the lay of the land for us in 2016 and looking the the what was contributing to that dynamic in that election what can we look forward to in 2018 isn't is you know NAFTA says NAFTA now back in play is this part of the mix well it depends what president Trump's decides to do you mean he certainly pulled out of the deal in Asia immediately that that Obama had been working on and obviously a lot of progressives opposed so it's highly likely that he's going to try to amend or change NAFTA and of course how does that play in you know this whole open borders thing and then this issue with the wall and immigration I think they're all connected I mean his base is worried that the the country's becoming grayer and the country's becoming browner and they all know by 2050 it will be a white white population will be the majority minority so I think a lot of these moves are fear as they're facing a future that people have never lived in I think Nancy Pelosi recently said her greatest aspiration is that one of her grandkids would be brown what does that mean well I think that she's probably realizing at her age and in her position in California of course she comes from Baltimore her you know her relatives were the mayors of Baltimore she's probably thinking of inclusivity that you know things that used to be taboo biracial marriages you know loving versus Virginia in 68 used to be illegal I mean you know almost these people don't forget grew up you know at the end of the Jim Crow era that are still in power I mean I think the 2018 elections are going to be about you know the politics of women and progressivism and democratic socialism versus the politics of dog whistles and white supremacy fair enough so let's talk about women in politics because it seemed there is a groundswell of activity amongst women in politics they're very active all over the country and is this trend of course after the me2 movement and after a lot of the controversy of the 2016 election involving trump is are we going to now see a wave of women in office and what does that portend randy we're gonna see a wave of women running for office and then i my assumption is a number of these women will win and what we're going to see is as a change of values that are implemented in Washington and state capitals and county seats across this country because women tend to look at issues a bit differently than men there are gender differences in this and I think that's a good thing I mean we need to have people at the table they need to be there in the decision-making process and and I think that that those are the kind of changes that this country needs let's talk about focus for a second so the Democratic Party they are still focused on some of these issues from a year ago the so called Russia gate for example are they may be wasting political capital at this point on chasing that where they could be looking at something else at this stage of the game that might give them greater penetration into the hearts and minds of the voter well I mean the Mueller investigation and what you term Russia gate you know that's kind of keeping alive people's thoughts and kind of the the negativity around Trump's win but the truth of the matter is simply that you can't be a party or a political movement that is opposed to everything you have to be a party that is for something and that's what you're getting at right so what's your program and you know and you know leader Schumer has been asked that others have been asked that you've got to come out clearly and what is say what do we stand for it well you know there are those senators and leaders in DC that have said that I mean they stand for universal health care for instance they stand for supporting the dreamers they stand for a number of progressive moves that would be good for this country the problem is that at the very top whether it's the Republican or Democratic Party it's you know you've got your left wing in your right wing but the plane is the corporate plane that's the ultimate problem the money issue well you know the the jobs issue is was really driving a lot of the votes in 2016 great disenfranchisement in America from coast to coast people were feeling as though they were not participating in the economy Trump brought in these tax cuts that have had at the moment a great effect increasing jobs increasing salaries you got Amazon with 20,000 new jobs you got Apple computer gonna create 20,000 new jobs so the voter who goes to the voting box they are looking at their paycheck and they're thinking you know why would I change at this point well I think that that focusing on Amazon and focusing on Apple is just our obsession with focusing on the whales you know whales don't live in an environment with an awful lot of plankton I mean you need to have everything in the economic biosphere so to speak right and that means small businesses that means medium-sized businesses they'd like to do that because it catches people's attention that we're got 20,000 jobs a small business in the economy of millions and millions of jobs it's just a drop in this bomb business is reporting increasing activity they're hiring they're expanding I mean it's trickling down I mean the trickle down that we've heard about since Reagan actually it's trickling down I don't think that that's it's that's not the reason we already had expansion in this economy coming forward there already was growth you can look at the trend line from 2009 because the tax cut we're giving everybody in the company a thousand bucks that's running that's real money well you could have been giving everyone money by actually as supporting other programs that people could spend for instance you know when people have section eight and they get rent vouchers who owns all that real estate that's rent that comes in your pocket that's hot that's thousand dollars every month yeah thousand dollars one time divided over 12 then I take out some for the taxman so fair enough so you're comparing what you would describe as a gimmick versus a more structural reform that could be sustainable over a generation that would be more meaningful I think is what you're selling describe it is like getting on a sugar high what happens after that to follow up on this you were a mayor what do you think of these various cities across America prostrating themselves at the feet of Jeff Bezos begging for Amazon to open their second headquarters there well the way economic development works in our country is we force municipalities counties and states to compete against each other as opposed to having you know a coherent policy or manufacturing policy that's unified that you don't have people throwing you know tax breaks and this and that at these various companies so I would just say that Beezus and others are are you know playing by the rules of the system and forcing the politicians you know to come to them you know what the best offer I mean though the truth of the matter is they want to do a ribbon cutting and say we just opened a new plant that created 10,000 jobs that's a lot more sexy and interesting than saying I just worked with you know 5,000 businesses that created two jobs yeah I'm trying to hit home runs instead of get walks in signals you're throwing the home they're throwing the long ball back to the baseball metaphors that we love so much here North Carolina we do I do yeah you know so what is now the attitude in the Democratic Party I mean they I mean I hear what you're saying it sound you know like you're trying to bring it up bring it all together like rational you know I was underestimated Trump and it looks like that's gonna continue I mean what's gonna derail this guy I mean that no skeleton in the closet seems strong enough to derail him nobody in Washington can stop him he's got his Twitter sphere that he just broadcast directly which it goes through around mainstream media he's out he's unstoppable how are you gonna stop him the electoral college was designed to stop a person like trumpet it didn't because our institutions have been failing for decades that's a very interesting point the Electoral College was designed to stop a charismatic let's say person from garnering the popular vote in a way that would be not representational to the nation as a whole and somehow he defeated that in won the electoral vote how was that possible against the most widely anticipated win in American presidential history for Hillary well on a lot of levels I mean it wasn't just Donald Trump you know Republican policymakers have you know and Americans for Prosperity and other groups have been you know working on ways to suppress the vote since Obama won I mean this is about the politics of race as well this is about the politics of preserving white privilege and white power so I mean these things were already there this table was set and Donald just kind of elbowed his way into the room he benefited from suppression in Wisconsin when I told you how he could win I laid out the states that he could win based on what Reagan Democrats did in the past and based on how Sanders did in the primary and it happened but let's not forget that in Wisconsin tens of thousands of people were not able to vote based on voter ID laws that were ran through by support from the Koch brothers and others why because they know if certain populations vote their ideas will not win which is why they don't want to have a huge turnout they win when they turn onto smaller and speaking about 2018 yes there could be a blue wave but what's holding it back is a red firewall what's that red firewall gerrymandering most of these districts are impossible to win in right being a state that is the most gerrymandered probably in the country is far from flora I'm hearing you would know better but is that the case yes North Carolina is rated on indices you know from you know people around the world where they look at actual countries and let's not forget we got 10 million people in the state so we're as large as many countries as being one of the least democratic places on the planet when they rate you know axis is election interfering focused on maybe domestically instead of looking from outside forces there we going to go you're a numbers man we got to go thanks for being on the guys report thank you for having me on the report all right that's gonna do it for this edition for the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser is tastier but I don't think I guess for an evil or if you want to reach us on Twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye
