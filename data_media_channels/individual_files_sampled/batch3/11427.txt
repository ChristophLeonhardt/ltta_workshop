EU officials delivered a joint statement who once again show their full backing to the Iran nuclear deal in the face of Donald Trump's criticism of the agreement despite his verbal attack the US president is still expected to extend sanctions relief for Tehran this week as agreed under the deal greatly valued the jcpoa the nuclear deal with Iran the deal is working we want to protect the jcpoa worldwide support for this deal make sure that the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions has a positive impact on trade Iran is in compliance with this agreement the only agreement which prevents us for the proliferation of nuclear weapons is crucial for the security of the region the Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2015 with other six countries including the u.s. it was reached after nine long years of negotiations as a result at end it had ended a 12-year confrontation over the country's nuclear activities it was seen as a breakthrough at the time but the u.s. President Donald Trump would go on to brand it the worst deal one of the worst deals I've ever seen the disastrous deal with Iran one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts the people that negotiated that deal namely Kerry and his friends are incompetent one of the worst deals ever negotiated we spoke to politics professor at the University of Tehran Siyad Mohammad morandi who thinks president Trump is trying to damage every legacy of the Obama years if the Europeans were to completely abide by the agreement not just verbally if they stood up to the Americans and defended their businesses and their companies and prevented the United States from shutting down Europeans businesses with Iran then there may be some hope for the deal but if the Europeans want to just simply verbally oppose the United States then I think that will be the the deals I don't think Trump has any problem in particular with a deal because I'm not even sure he's ever read the deal but one thing is clear and that Trump has a problem with anything that Obama has done before him anything that Obama has it that is considered to be a part of Obama's legacy is something that Trump wants to demolish
