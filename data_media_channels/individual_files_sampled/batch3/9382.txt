♪ ♪ Sean: HERE WITH MORE REACTION TO ALL OF TONIGHT'S BREAKING NEWS, AUTHOR OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLE BEST SELLER, THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR NATION'S GREAT COMEBACK, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT GINGRICH. THE LIST IS PRETTY AMAZING. IT REALLY IS AWESOME. HERE'S A QUESTION, ARE WE BETTER OFF AS A COUNTRY THEN WE WERE JUST TWO SHORT YEARS AGO WITH 4 MILLION NEW JOBS, 8 MILLION FEWER AMERICANS IN POVERTY ON FOOD STAMPS. LET'S SEE, A PATH TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS ON A BORDER WALL. NORTH KOREA, IRAN. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK ON SECURITY, ECONOMIC ISSUES, RECORDS IN 14 STATES, RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK WE ARE BETTER OFF BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT. THIS ELECTION IS A LIFE-AND-DEATH STRUGGLE WITH A LEFT-WING MOVEMENT THAT WANTS TO LEAD DEMOCRATIC ALLIES AMERICA. YOU ARE HAPPY THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE AT WORK. THAT TOOK PEOPLE OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. IT MEANT THERE WERE NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SO IF YOU ARE A LEFT-WING DEMOCRAT THAT'S ACTUALLY BAD, NOT GOOD. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BUT I HAVE A PREDICTION FOR YOU. SOMETIMES POLITICIANS AND THEIR CONSULTANTS AND EVERYBODY DOES ALL THIS PLANNING AND THEN HISTORY JUST PICK THINGS UP AND CHANGES EVERYTHING. I THINK TWO WORDS ARE GOING TO DEFINE THE NIGHT OF THE 2018 ELECTION IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS. ONE IS KAVANAUGH AND THE OTHER IS CARAVAN. AND THE COMBINATION OF ANGER OVER HOW THE LEFT SMEARED, ENGAGED IN CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, LIVE, USED BULLYING TACTICS WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO BE ONE PART OF THIS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LEFT IS EAGER TO HAVE 3,000 PEOPLE IN A CARAVAN ACROSS THE AMERICAN BORDER, BREAK AMERICAN LAW, RECOGNIZING THAT IF THAT HAPPENS, THE NEXT CARAVAN WILL BE EVEN BIGGER IN THE CARAVAN AFTER THAT WILL BE EVEN BIGGER AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REJECT BOTH THE WAY THEY TREATED KAVANAUGH IN THE WAY THEY ARE DEALING WITH BORDER AND I THINK THOSE WILL END UP BEING THE REASONS THE REPUBLICANS KEEP THE HOUSE AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SENATORS THEY HAV HAVE. Sean: MR. SPEAKER, ELECTIONS ARE USUALLY ABOUT PEACE AND PROSPERITY. I'M LOOKING AT THE ECONOMY, EVERY MEASURE WE ARE DOING BETTER. THIS IS WHAT I HEAR FROM THE DEMOCRATS, IMPEACHMENT, BUT DON'T SAY IT. OPEN BORDERS, BUT DON'T SAY IT. WANT THEIR CRIMES BACK, THEY WANT OBAMACARE AND THEY WANT ENDLESS INVESTIGATIONS INTO TERM. I DON'T HEAR ONE THING THAT THEY ARE RUNNING ON THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. OBAMACARE? A DISASTER. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PROPOSALS FOR GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE, WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY FOR, WOULD BANKRUPT THE SYSTEM, CRUSH THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND DESTROY MEDICARE, YOU LOOK AT ALL THOSE THINGS, YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE THINKING? AND YET DEMOCRAT AFTER DEMOCRAT HAS SIGNED UP FOR A PROGRAM WHICH I THINK ABSOLUTELY WOULD COLLAPSE MEDICARE AND ABSOLUTELY WOULD ELIMINATE ALL OF THE EMPLOYER-BASED INSURANCE SYSTEMS, WHICH IS WHAT BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HE WANTS TO DO. HE WANTS TO FORCE YOU AND ME AND EVERYONE ELSE INTO A SINGLE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT HE GETS TO DEFINE. Sean: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. I'M VERY HOPEFUL. I THINK THERE'S A REALLY GOOD SHOT RICK SCOTT, A GREAT GOVERNOR. I REALLY FEEL CONFIDENT IN THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT JOSH HAWLEY WILL WIN, WHO WE JUST HAD ON FOR MISSOURI AS CLAIRE McCASKILL HAS BEEN EXPOSED AND THE SAME WITH BLACKBURN AFTER BRETT IS AND HAS BEEN EXPOSED AND I'M HOPING DEAN HELLER, THE LATEST POLLS HAVE HIM UP. HE'S ALWAYS IN A TOUGH RACE IN NEVADA AND I THINK HE'S IN TROUBLE IN MONTANA. HEIDI HEITKAMP IS NOW IN DOUBLE DIGITS, AS SHOULD BE IN NORTH DAKOTA, JOE DONNELLY IN INDIANA. I THINK WE CAN WIN EVERYONE OF THOSE RACES. THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME TONIGHT, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE HOUSE. DON'T HAVE A BIG MARGIN THERE. LET ME ADD TO YOUR HAPPINESS. I THINK WE HAVE A REAL SHOT IN MINNESOTA. I THINK WE HAVE A REAL SHOT IN NEW JERSEY. THE SENATE COULD BECOME YOU REMEMBER IN 1980 WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH THE REAGAN TEAM, WE ENDED UP PICKING UP 12 SENATE SEATS, CONTROL OF THE SENATE, NOBODY EXPECTED. WE PICKED UP 12 SENATE SEATS IN ONE NIGHT. SO THIS COULD BECOME A BIG BLOWOUT. THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE BUT I THINK WHAT KEVIN McCARTHY IS DOING IN INTRODUCING A BILL TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND I WOULD URGE KEVIN TO CHALLENGE NANCY TELL MIKE NANCY PELOSI TO A NATIONAL DEBATE. LET HER DEFEND THE TOTAL FAILURE TO CONTROL THE AMERICAN BORDER, TO PROTECT AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY, TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND AND SAY NO MORE, TO WELCOME CARAVANS AND ALSO A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO UNDERMINE THE AMERICAN SYSTEM AND LET KEVIN EXPLAIN THE BILL HE'S GOT THAT HE WANTS TO BRING UP IN DECEMBER THAT CONTROLS THE SOUTHERN BORDER. I THINK IF THE CHOICE IS THAT CLEAR, IF OVER HERE YOU'VE GOT SANCTUARY CITIES, MS-13, FENTANYL, OPIOID DEATHS, ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THE DEMOCRATS SEEM TO ACCEPT, AND OVERHEAR YOU HAVE A PARTY DEDICATED TO PROTECTING YOU, PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY, PROTECTING YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, I THINK WE WILL DO JUST FINE ELECTION NIGHT. Sean: YOU VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE YOU ARE VOTING FOR PELOSI. VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRATIC SENATOR,
