in this classroom at the Art Center College of Design the numbers of male and female aspiring film directors are about equal and the women feel they have a fair shot at making it professionally the main thing I think as a woman filmmaker that you have to focus on is really just not being intimidated like not being intimidated by the amount of male colleagues you have and the amount of disparities in gender that you would encounter on set outside the classroom the gender disparity in the film industry is stark amy adrian crunched the numbers in her new documentary half the picture over about the past ten years women direct four percent of top feature films so obviously men direct ninety six percent of most movies you see in movie theaters and the numbers for TV are a little bit better think it's averages about women direct fifteen percent around of television shows so men direct eighty five percent every single way you looked at the numbers they were terrible for women that's despite the fact that women make up about 50 percent of film school graduates this year director Greta Gerwin has been nominated for an Academy Award for Lady Bird and the cinematographer Rachel Morrison is the first woman nominated for her work behind the camera in mud bound but those accolades are few and far between director Victoria Hochberg was part of a group that sued major Hollywood studios 30 years ago nothing has changed radically things have changed very very very slowly and in spurts only when the studios or the production companies or even the unions are threatened in some way and they have to worry about lawsuits in some European countries laws mandate equal representation in the industries including entertainment Adrian says a similar approach may be needed in Hollywood I think that it's very likely that the industry will need some kind of outside pressure to actually change despite that long history of gender disparity in the film industry many young aspiring female film directors are not discouraged I know it's gonna be tough and I know that as a woman I need to keep 200% determination to succeed in an industry that has stacked the deck against women Rob Reynolds al Jazeera Los Angeles
