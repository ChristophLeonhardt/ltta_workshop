Meet Dick and Liz Uihlein.
They spell it like this, but
they spell their company name
like this. “Uline” — it
sounds familiar, right?
You’ve probably
used their boxes.
The Wisconsin-based
company has grown
to be much more than boxes.
It’s a packaging supply giant
with over 6,000 employees.
The family comes
across as unassuming
in these corporate videos.
But when it comes to politics,
they’re anything but.
The Mercers, the Koch brothers
and Sheldon Adelson already
have the name recognition,
but the Uihleins may be the
biggest Republican donors
you’ve never heard of.
They’re pouring
their massive wealth
into super PACs backing
insurgent right-wing
candidates, already
spending roughly $26 million
on federal elections
this cycle.
Candidates backed
by Uihlein generally
support the Trump agenda,
sometimes veering even
further to the right.
“A proven conservative
fighting for Mississippi values.”
Earlier this year
Mr. Uihlein gave $2.5 million
to Jeanne Ives for governor
in their home state of Illinois.
She ran this ad against
incumbent Bruce Rauner
in the primary.
“Thank you for
signing legislation
that lets me use
the girls bathroom.”
The ad was criticized
as transphobic.
“That’s exactly what, typically,
a transgender man looks like —”
“No, it’s not.”
Ives lost.
“Roy Moore,
leadership we can trust.”
Mr. Uihlein also gave
over half a million dollars
to super PACs supporting
Roy Moore in Alabama.
Moore’s campaign was
compromised when
several women accused
him of sexually assaulting
them as teens.
“I trusted Mr. Moore, because
he was the district attorney.”
A Democrat ended up
winning that Senate race.
Mr. Uihlein contributed
half a million dollars
to a super PAC behind
Patrick Morrisey.
He turned the “drain the swamp”
rallying cry into something
resembling a terrorist threat
in this campaign ad.
“Let's not just
change Washington,
let’s blow it up
and reinvent it.
That‘s better.”
Morrisey won the Republican
primary in West Virginia,
after President
Trump disparaged
his controversial opponent.
“Mr. President, if you are
watching right now,
let me tell you:
Your tweet was huge.”
Sometimes the Uihleins
support outsider candidates
who wouldn’t stand a
chance without the money.
Wisconsin voters hadn’t
heard of Kevin Nicholson,
a political newcomer trying to
unseat Democrat Tammy Baldwin,
the first openly gay senator.
Then Mr. Uihlein
donated over $7 million
to super PACs
supporting Nicholson.
The Republican Party
has endorsed
a different candidate
in that race.
But polls suggest
that Nicholson is now
a strong contender.
The Uihleins spend the most
in their home states
of Illinois and Wisconsin,
but they fund candidates
across the country.
These megadonations
are helping
to shape the 2018
elections, while pushing
the Republican Party
further to the right.
