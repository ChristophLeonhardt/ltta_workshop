I'm here in Abraham's cave this is the tomb of Abraham and because of the tension here between the Israelis and the Palestinians and because the Christians and the Israeli Jews and the Muslims share Abraham and share their right to this place what they've actually had to do to make this work is divide this cave so I am on the Jewish side and then on the other side is the Palestinian side of the cave so they've had to make like a artificial separation so that the two can worship without killing each other and it's just this crazy conflict of religion and tension hatred versus love it makes no sense at all to me and it's weird that we're separated by a great from the Palestinian side when they're both supposed to be worshipping a guy who brought about one God the worship of one God but here they're more divided than ever here at the tomb of Abraham the Jews and the Muslims have to worship separately in order that they can get along to hear more of the truths that the mainstream won't tell you join us at rebel Israel calm you
