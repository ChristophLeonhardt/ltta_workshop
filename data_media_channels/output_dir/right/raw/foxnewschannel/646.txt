1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:02,347
AS A NATION, NOT LEFT OR RIGHT,

2
00:00:02,348 --> 00:00:03,315
GET OUR PRESIDENT IS TAKING

3
00:00:03,316 --> 00:00:06,251
CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES.

4
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:07,786
WHY?

5
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:08,553
>> Josh: I THINK YOU MADE A

6
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:09,287
MISTAKE YESTERDAY AND LET ME BE

7
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:10,822
VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT I THINK

8
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:13,758
WAS A MISTAKE.

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,160
NOBODY IS CRITICIZING HIS VIEW

10
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:17,262
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AN OPEN

11
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:18,830
DISCUSSION WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN

12
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:19,231
AND RUSSIA.

13
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:20,632
I THINK THAT'S CONSTRUCTIVE.

14
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:23,368
THAT PIECE OF THE MEETING,

15
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:23,768
GREAT.

16
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,773
ISSUE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION WITH

17
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:30,375
RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN OUR

18
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:31,776
ELECTION.

19
00:00:31,777 --> 00:00:33,678
AND ON THE WORLD STAGE, YOU ARE

20
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,312
NOT AFFORDED THE LUXURY AS

21
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:36,481
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

22
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,416
AT DIVIDING WHAT ARE AMERICAN

23
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:40,218
INSTITUTIONS BEING THE

24
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:41,419
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE

25
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,687
FBI FROM YOUR ADMINISTRATION AS

26
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:44,589
A WHOLE IN FRONT OF FOREIGN

27
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:44,990
ADVERSARIES.

28
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,157
YOU JUST AREN'T.

29
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:46,992
THAT'S NOT A LUXURY THE

30
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:47,826
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

31
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,765
CONTINUING TO GIVE HIS CRITICS

32
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:54,833
FODDER TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW

33
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:57,435
HE IS HIDING SOMETHING ON RUSSIA

34
00:00:57,436 --> 00:01:00,972
DOES MORE TO UNDERMINE HIS

35
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,240
PRESIDENCY AND THE END OF THIS

36
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:02,907
MUELLER INVESTIGATION THAN

37
00:01:02,908 --> 00:01:03,675
ANYTHING ELSE HE CAN DO.

38
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:07,579
I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

39
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,913
I THINK RAND PAUL AND OTHERS

40
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:10,115
THAT WERE TALKING THEY ARE

41
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:11,182
MISSING THE POINT.

42
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:13,184
IT IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE

43
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:14,786
INTERACTING WITH RUSSIA.

44
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:15,186
THAT'S FINE.

45
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:16,554
THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO

46
00:01:16,555 --> 00:00:00,000
GO ON A FOREIGN STAGE, YOU
