I listened to lawyers on both sides last night and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it I listened to a panel of judges and I'll comment on that I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge but I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to in my opinion help the court in terms of respect for the court they do what they should be doing I mean it's it's so sad they should be you know when you read something so simple and so beautifully written and so perfectly written other than the one statement of course having to do with Yoshi but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody and then you have lawyers and you watched I watched last night in amazement and i heard things that I couldn't believe things that really had nothing to do with what i just read and I don't ever want to call a court bias so won't call it biased and we haven't had a decision yet but courts seemed to be so political and it would be so great for a justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right
