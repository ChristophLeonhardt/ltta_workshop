AND THIS GOES IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

79
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,646
DIRECTION. >> McGRIER’S ATTORNEY SAID THIS

80
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:03,047
>> McGRIER’S ATTORNEY SAID THIS ABOUT THE FACT THAT HIS CLIENT

81
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,149
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HIS CLIENT AND THE OFFICER ARE BOTH BLACK.

82
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:05,683
AND THE OFFICER ARE BOTH BLACK. LET’S LISTEN.

LET’S LISTEN. >> WELL, THE THING IS THAT A

84
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,921
>> WELL, THE THING IS THAT A GANG THAT CUTS ACROSS RACIAL

85
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,524
GANG THAT CUTS ACROSS RACIAL LINES, YOU’VE GOT SOME BAD WHITE

86
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:14,959
LINES, YOU’VE GOT SOME BAD WHITE OFFICERS AND SOME BAD BLACK

87
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:15,326
OFFICERS AND SOME BAD BLACK OFFICERS.

88
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,463
OFFICERS. THE BLACK OFFICERS, OFTENTIMES,

89
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,665
THE BLACK OFFICERS, OFTENTIMES, ARE MORE ALIGNED WITH THE BLUE

90
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,300
ARE MORE ALIGNED WITH THE BLUE UNIFORM THAN THE BROWN SKINS OF

91
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,269
UNIFORM THAN THE BROWN SKINS OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE

92
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:25,636
THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE POLICING.

93
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,571
POLICING. >> THAT’S A LOT IN ONE SENTENCE.

94
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,741
>> THAT’S A LOT IN ONE SENTENCE. BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE

95
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,242
BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE BALTIMORE HAS A HISTORY OF

96
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:34,078
BALTIMORE HAS A HISTORY OF TROUBLE BETWEEN, AS YOU JUST

97
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,080
TROUBLE BETWEEN, AS YOU JUST SAID, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

98
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,981
SAID, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE.

99
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,749
COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE. HOW DO YOU MIX THIS ALL IN?

100
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:40,985
HOW DO YOU MIX THIS ALL IN? >> JUST BEAR IN MIND YOU HAD AN

101
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,653
>> JUST BEAR IN MIND YOU HAD AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN OFFICER AND AN

102
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:43,655
AFRICAN-AMERICAN OFFICER AND AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN THAT WAS

103
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:44,989
AFRICAN-AMERICAN THAT WAS ARRESTED.

104
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,191
ARRESTED. AFRICAN-AMERICANS DO WANT TO BE

105
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,759
AFRICAN-AMERICANS DO WANT TO BE POLICED ACCORDINGLY, AND THEY

106
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,794
POLICED ACCORDINGLY, AND THEY DIDN’T SIGN UP TO HAVE OTHER

107
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,461
DIDN’T SIGN UP TO HAVE OTHER AFRICAN-AMERICAN OFFICERS

108
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,095
AFRICAN-AMERICAN OFFICERS ASSAULT THEM.

109
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,198
ASSAULT THEM. SO IT GOES BACK TO THAT

110
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,333
SO IT GOES BACK TO THAT RELATIONSHIP WHERE THE TWO

111
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:56,901
RELATIONSHIP WHERE THE TWO ENTITIES NEED TO CO-EXIST AND

112
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,636
ENTITIES NEED TO CO-EXIST AND HOW DO YOU EFFECTIVELY BRING

113
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,105
HOW DO YOU EFFECTIVELY BRING PEOPLE INTO CUSTODY AND NOT

114
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,207
PEOPLE INTO CUSTODY AND NOT EMBARK UPON A BOXING MATCH BUT

115
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:02,974
EMBARK UPON A BOXING MATCH BUT PROFESSIONAL POLICING.

116
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,775
PROFESSIONAL POLICING. AND THAT’S THE ISSUE THAT WE

117
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,510
AND THAT’S THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE.

118
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,978
HAVE HERE. THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL

119
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:08,980
THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL POLICING IN INSTANCES LIKE THIS

120
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:11,015
POLICING IN INSTANCES LIKE THIS WHICH CREATES A BETTER OR MORE

121
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,317
WHICH CREATES A BETTER OR MORE HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT FOR THE

122
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:13,251
HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND

123
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:13,718
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.
