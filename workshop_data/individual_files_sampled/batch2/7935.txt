we've been reporting on the negative effects of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas for years now on TYT going back and today we've got a new one and this one is absolutely horrendous development it has to do with the effect that fracking has on your health which we've known it has negative health effects for quite some time environmental groups such as the NRDC says that for people living near fracking sites fracking can have severe health effects such as respiratory illnesses and cancer now that you know can accrue over time and as you're exposed to both the air the water all of that that's terrible but let's talk about what effects even more vulnerable individuals a new study from the journal Science advances found that fracking reduces the health of infants born to mothers living within three kilometres from a fracking site but for mothers living within one kilometer the effects were acute the probability of low infant birth weight meaning the infant weighs less than 5.5 pounds increased to 25 percent nationwide between the middle of 2012 in the middle of 2013 as many as 65 thousand infants were exposed to pollution from fracking because their mothers lived within one kilometre of a fracking site and that's just a period over one year and obviously far more would live within three kilometers of a fracking site which again would have health effects not accruing over a long period of your life and increasing the incidence of respiratory illnesses and cancer but literally affecting you as you are born yeah so it's possible that I'm not a naturally born Lib and so when I heard about fracking I thought jury's out I mean we started this thing back when it started right and let's so it's not fossil fuels it's a little bit better in that sense yeah but I I want to see what evidence there is and so I know evidence is beginning to come in and it's not good so does it cause earthquakes now indisputably yeah yeah there's no question about that I mean hundreds of earthquakes in the middle of Oklahoma yet we showed you the charts that may be the scariest chart I think that we've ever shown the rise in earthquakes oh yeah yeah so there's there's no question about it and now in this case just look at the evidence right and again I didn't prejudge it and presuppose anything I did okay John did more okay and folks by the way that they're not presupposing him so like Josh Fox who's worked a lot on this he already knows a lot of this information this happens to be new there's a lot of other damaging information so totally in this case so what they did was they looked at things that were two to nine miles away from the fragment site and it's actually not that much of a difference between your normal you know bursts and and nine miles from a fracking site is a rough description of this thing so it turns out it doesn't affect you that much if you're far enough away from the fracking so it's not it's not a Chinese hoax they weren't trying to jury-rig it so it turns out if you're far enough away from it it's at least in the case of the infant you know issue birth weight the birth weight etcetera it's not that much overall whether you get within two miles and you're starting to see increase in problems for kids that are being born and start in significantly you get to within half a mile one out of every four baby that is born it weighs under five and a half pounds which then leads to all the issues that John talked about you know you've got infant mortality asthma lower test scores and I mean it really it affects your development as a human being average income later on in life as an adult yeah and by the way if you're pro-life you should be livid about this it's happening to fetuses right it is causing enormous problems for them for the rest of their lives while they're in utero that died and and so will dive over it that's exactly right at least the infant mortality and it's happening to a gigantic one-quarter 25% of the babies that are that close to the fracking sites yeah that that jury is now in thankfully the other three-fourths they will be born in a normal birth weight and then so long as they don't move away soon enough will eventually have respiratory illnesses and cancer and stuff like that I guess yeah so it doesn't really get better then you gather you got those ailments and then if you've survived all that and now your percentages are getting lower and lower for being able to survive all that then you've got the earthquakes yeah let alone everything else so it is is is it worth it you know we have renewable energy now and and solar energy creates more jobs than fossil fuel does now and and so we can actually get more jobs we could have cleaner energy and and it's just because this is a little bit easier and those particular companies are making that profit off of that yes but it's not worth it for our kids it just isn't worth it yeah I'm planning on I got a I got a IndieGoGo the money but I do want to do a study if being born within a couple of miles of a windmill leads to lower birth rate I'm not sure but I'm really hoping it's okay what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a
