1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:02,422
“Even by his biggest critics,
Glenn Thrush today writes

2
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:06,727
"he’s never been as entrenched
in an issue, in a project, in this case

3
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:08,662
"a recovery and
rescue like this.”

4
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:11,066
“No member of Congress can do
what the President of the United States

5
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:15,004
"can do in reaching out to both parties
to be able to say, ‘This is a national crisis.

6
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:18,041
"'We, as a country, need to pull together
for fellow citizens who are suffering

7
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,443
"'and to lower the rhetoric.’"

8
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:22,914
By the way, Chris Christie has an excuse,
he was saying all of this to justify him

9
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:25,718
hugging president Obama in
the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy-

10
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:29,222
whereas the New York Times wrote
this piece praising Trump's alleged call

11
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:32,259
for unity- even though that's not
what he did- most likely just

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,398
to butter him up so they can maintain 
their unfettered access to the administration.

13
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:38,368
Why else would this piece
feature statements like:

14
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:43,273
In announcing his trips, he used the dulcet,
reassuring anduplifting language of prior presidents.

15
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:47,545
His rhetoric was strikingly different from his
much-criticized pronouncements at a news

16
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:52,151
conference this month when he equated
the actions of leftist protesters in Charlottesville

17
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:57,158
with the violent, torch-wielding alt-right activists
who hurled anti-Semitic and racist epithets.

18
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:01,230
Which I’m assuming is praising Trump
for not saying “black” looters need

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,601
to get shot for trying to save
their lives or something?

20
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:08,539
I mean, Trump optics commentary is 
largely redundant at this point, but

21
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:11,376
since the New York Times thinks
what Trump is doing is presidential,

22
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:15,948
let’s talk about it. One of the first
fucking things presidential Trump said

23
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:17,283
when he landed was:

24
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:20,788
“What a crowd. what a turnout.” 
"I wanna shout out to Hurricane Harvey

25
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:25,728
"for gathering this many people here today.
Also, shoutout to Joel Osteen- big church,

26
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:28,498
"big beautiful church. 
Opens his doors to everybody."

27
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:31,568
I mean, to claim that Trump is being
presidential simply because

28
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:35,841
he’s “toned down his Twitter presence”
and sticking to “media outlets used

29
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:38,877
"by his predecessors.” is next 
level sycophantic horseshit.

30
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:41,281
Especially when Trump’s description
of Harvey ranged from

31
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:45,219
“whoa, look at all this rain” to
“rain so big it’s like Texas”

32
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,153
he literally said that.

33
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:49,357
“Still pouring, still a lot of rain.
Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.

34
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:52,695
"I’ve heard the words ‘epic.’
I’ve heard ‘historic.’”

35
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,265
And what’s doubly messed up about
the NYTimes approach is when

36
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:58,470
you consider that Trump knew very
well the hurricane would take over

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,940
the news cycle, which is why
he used it as an opportunity

38
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,711
to pardon Joe Arpaio, the most racist 
sheriff in America for indiscriminately

39
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:06,913
targeting latinos and putting
them in tent cities.

40
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:09,617
He famously called
concentration camps.

41
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:16,159
And I assume Trump was also extra
presidential when he used the chaos

42
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,364
to push his insane transgender ban that
even his generals aren’t on board with,

43
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:24,069
that will cost taxpayers WAY more to
enact even though we were told

44
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,840
it was necessary for financial reasons.
And look, I don’t really care that

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,011
Trump spared us the photo op that
every president and presidential

46
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,182
hopeful engages in by hugging
actual victims. We all know

47
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:37,853
he’s too much of an elitist to actually
engage with the unwashed masses-

48
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:41,458
let’s be real. I also don’t give a shit
that Melania looked like a distant,

49
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,729
elitist asshole in her stilettos
walking into a disaster zone.

50
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,165
Yes, the Trumps were there.
And now they’re gone-

51
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:50,435
Because Trumpis literally hitting
the campaign trail once again.

52
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:53,406
This was just a pitstop for him
to sell fucking $40 hats.

53
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:57,912
But you know that was also presidential, at least 
it didn’t say "MAGA" it said "USA" on them.

54
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,882
I don’t care about any of this but what 
I do care about is how Republicans

55
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:05,923
are moving in congress to cut $1 billion
in relief funding to fund Trump’s stupid,

56
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:08,025
unrealistic Mexico 
border wall.

57
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:11,663
Trump just waved, thanked the crowd
and pushed onward to Missouri

58
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:14,333
to talk about something he and 
his wealthy benefactors actually

59
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,001
give a shit about- 
Tax Cuts-

60
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:21,142
“...by reducing the crushing tax burden
on our companies and our workers.”

61
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:25,948
So yeah, this guy isn’t even trying to
appease his base- with the notable

62
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:29,252
exceptions of tasteless water carrying
for Nazis- and you’re all trying

63
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:32,356
your goddamn best to call him
“presidential” as if some

64
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:36,194
NYTimes-stamped “return to normalcy”
will undo the lasting damage

65
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:40,099
this tyrannical narcissistic neocon
is doing from the bully pulpit.

66
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,569
At least we should be glad
we’re not celebrating him

67
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,007
for putting more troops in Afghanistan
or bombing the shit out of Syria

68
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:49,545
or Yemen or something. But I guess
this isn’t surprising since the extremely

69
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:53,383
logical elitists that write these think pieces
are the same ones who kept calling

70
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:56,520
Trump a fucking populist- and
conveniently ignored or attacked

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,559
Bernie Sanders, an actual populist-
And to be honest, sometimes I can’t help

72
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:04,430
but feel like the press deserves it.
The New York Times does amazing work

73
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,368
and is more important than ever right
now, and yet in the past 24 hours

74
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:10,672
they’ve published a series of garbage
fires that I would rate from tasteless

75
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:14,910
to uniquely dangerous- starting with the less 
serious “cultural appropriation is dope”

76
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,315
hot take, followed by “Trump is being
presidential after Harvey moment,”

77
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:22,153
and ending with the supremely fucked-
Eric Prince op-ed on why we must

78
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:25,658
wage wars with mercenaries instead 
of troops. Because privatization of

79
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:28,862
death has been really fucking
successful thus far-

80
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,097
let’s just colonize the
Middle East, fuck it.

81
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:34,535
In the end of the day, what’s happening
in Houston is absolutely awful,

82
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,406
and my heart is with the good
people of Texas. But don’t mistake

83
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:41,077
Trump stopping by for a hot second
as giving the proper care and attention

84
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:44,581
Houston deserves. It’’s just another pitstop
on his campaign trail where he’ll be

85
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:49,154
promoting bullshit that doesn’t actually 
help anyone making less than $250K a year.

86
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:53,159
He’s only there to shill 
his stupid fucking hats.

87
