1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,186
>> JUST STAY TUNED.

2
00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:04,154
>> Martha: STAY TUNED, OKAY.

3
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:06,357
WE WILL.

4
00:00:06,357 --> 00:00:07,057
SENATOR GRAHAM, THANK YOU VERY

5
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:08,992
MUCH, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

6
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:11,362
HERE NO JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS

7
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,963
STRATEGIC ANALYST, SENIOR

8
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:14,131
STRATEGIC ANALYST AND CARE,

9
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:14,832
CHAIRMAN OF THE INSTITUTE OF

10
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:16,332
WAR, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:18,168
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE

12
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:18,869
WITNESSED LAST NIGHT BETWEEN

13
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,707
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN?

14
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:27,945
>> I THINK EVERYBODY AROUND THE

15
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,747
PRESIDENT I THINK HAS GOT THE

16
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:30,814
IMPRESSION THAT KIM JONG UN HAS

17
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,149
MADE A STRATEGIC POLICY CHANGE,

18
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,384
THAT HE WANTS TO MOVE AWAY AS

19
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:36,920
YOU DEFINED IT FROM THE

20
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,621
STATUS QUO AS WE KNOW IT TO

21
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,523
SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY

22
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:42,593
DIFFERENT TO OPEN UP MAY BE

23
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:44,528
PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR HIS

24
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:44,862
COUNTRY.

25
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:45,696
WE ARE IN THE BEGINNING OF THAT

26
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:48,432
PROCESS TO BE SURE AND WE'VE GOT

27
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,833
TO GET TO THE FACTS AND THE

28
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,568
DETAILS OF IT.

29
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:52,503
TO ME, THE ESSENCE OF IT WILL

30
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:55,539
COME DOWN TO THIS, WHEN OUR

31
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:59,643
PEOPLE PUT IN FRONT OF THEM, WE

32
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,044
NEED TO KNOW WHERE ALL OF YOUR

33
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:04,214
NUCLEAR FACILITIES ARE LOCATED

34
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:05,949
TO APPROVE YOUR FUEL SITES, YOUR

35
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:07,985
RESEARCH AND TEST CENTERS UNDER

36
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,020
BALLISTIC MISSILES, WE BELIEVE

37
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,723
UNCLASSIFIED TEN TO 20 NUCLEAR

38
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:14,525
WEAPONS, 70 TO 80 BALLISTIC

39
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,125
MISSILES.

40
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,560
WE KNOW WHERE MOST OF THAT IS,

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,730
BUT NOT WHERE ALL OF THAT IS.

42
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,531
WHEN THEY PUT THOSE

43
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:21,265
IDENTIFICATION AND LOCATIONS ON

44
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,700
THE TABLE, THEY ARE LYING TO US

45
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,003
WE WILL KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE

46
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,139
KNOW WHERE MOST OF IT IS AND

47
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:29,907
THAT WILL BE VERY REVEALING TO

48
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:30,174
US.

49
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,544
IF THEY ARE REALLY GOING TO

50
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:34,244
DISCLOSE WHERE EVERYTHING IS

51
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:37,214
THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IN

52
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:37,815
DENUCLEARIZING, THAT IS

53
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:41,585
FUNDAMENTALLY STEP 12 MOVING

54
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:42,386
TOWARDS VERIFICATION OF ALL OF

55
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,621
THOSE SYSTEMS THAT THEY

56
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,022
IDENTIFIED.

57
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,690
SO THAT STAFF HAS YET TO BE

58
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,424
TAKEN AND WHEN IT DOES IT WILL

59
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:50,727
BE VERY REVEALING.

60
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:52,029
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU MAKE

61
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,764
OF THE PRESIDENT SAYING WE DON'T

62
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:55,799
REALLY NEED TO DO THESE

63
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,400
EXERCISES, THE BIANNUAL

64
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,802
EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA, IS

65
00:01:58,802 --> 00:01:59,203
PROVOCATIVE.

66
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,738
THAT WAS THE WHERE THE PRESIDENT

67
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:04,007
USED AND UNNECESSARY, IS HE

68
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:07,911
RIGHT?

69
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,812
>> I THINK THEY SLIGHTLY CAME

70
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:10,347
OUT OF NEGOTIATIONS.

71
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:11,582
MY TAKE ON IT, I DON'T THINK IT

72
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,150
WAS ON THE TABLE GOING IN.

73
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,352
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING MAYBE

74
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,153
KIM JONG UN MENTIONED ABOUT IT

75
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:18,755
BEING PROVOCATIVE THAT WE FLY

76
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:19,523
NUCLEAR BOMBERS UP TO ALMOST THE

77
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:22,793
BORDER OF NORTH KOREA AND HE

78
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,928
SENSES THAT THAT IS AN ACT OF

79
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:25,729
AGGRESSION IN A SENSE, DESPITE

80
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,965
THE FACT OF ALL OF HIS ACTS OF

81
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,766
AGGRESSION THAT HIS REGIME HAS

82
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,335
DONE FOR YEARS.

83
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,169
HERE'S WHAT I THINK.

84
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,070
IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT THE

85
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,274
PRESIDENT SAID, IT'S

86
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,977
CONDITIONS-BASED.

87
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:41,545
THE EXERCISE OF COMING A SPRING

88
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:42,145
OF 2019.

89
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:42,946
WE ARE GOING TO KNOW BY THE END

90
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:46,316
OF THIS YEAR THAT THESE GUYS ARE

91
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,185
REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT

92
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,554
DENUCLEARIZATION AND STARTING UP

93
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:51,321
THAT EXERCISE AGAIN AND STARTING

94
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:55,292
UP SANCTIONS AGAIN AND BEGINNING

95
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,561
CYBER OFFENSE OF OPERATIONS FOR

96
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,595
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME, ALL OF

97
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,396
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ON THE

98
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,465
TABLE IF THEY ARE NOT SERIOUS.

99
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:06,403
I THINK THE MEDIA, NOT FOX, IS

100
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,738
OVERREACTING TO THIS IN MANY

101
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,139
SENSES THAT WE MADE A MAJOR

102
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,140
CONCESSION.

103
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,807
WE REALLY HAVEN'T MADE ANY

104
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,376
CONCESSION WHATSOEVER.

105
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,578
WE HAVE THROWN THEM A BONE SO TO

106
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:15,145
SPEAK.

107
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:15,879
PROVOCATIVE IS PROBABLY A POOR

108
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,580
CHOICE FOR THE PRESIDENCY WAS

109
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,448
BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY

110
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,553
KIM JONG UN'S TERM.

111
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:24,121
THE MONEY INVOLVED IS NOT

112
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:24,521
SIGNIFICANT.

113
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,690
>> Martha: AS YOU SAY, THAT'S

114
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,058
A GREAT POINT, GENERAL, THAT

115
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:31,795
WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE AREN'T

116
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,363
GOING TO NOT CONTINUE WITH THESE

117
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,064
EXERCISES, IT GIVES YOU LIKE

118
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,766
GEORGE WHEN YOU GET AROUND TO

119
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,466
THAT POINT NEXT SPRING WHEN

120
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,334
THINGS ARE GOING THE WAY YOU

121
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:37,634
LIKE.

122
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,368
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING

123
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,069
INTERESTING FOR YOU THAT THE

124
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,337
WHITE HOUSE PUT UP.

125
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:41,738
THIS WAS THE VIDEO THAT WAS PUT

126
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,774
TOGETHER BY THE ADMINISTRATION

127
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:46,310
TO PLAY FOR KIM JONG UN ON, AND

128
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,844
IT'S INTERESTING TO PLAY THIS

129
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:51,148
VIDEO WITH THE FACT IN MIND THAT

130
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,750
KIM JONG UN'S FATHER WAS A BIG

131
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,552
FILM BUFF AND VERY INVOLVED IN

132
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,487
THE FILM INDUSTRY, SUCH AS IT IS

133
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,589
A NORTH KOREA ENDED MAKING THESE

134
00:03:58,589 --> 00:03:59,790
KINDS OF TRAILERS THAT PERHAPS

135
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,557
THAT WAS THE REASON BEHIND

136
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:01,992
TRYING TO REACH IN THIS WAY.

137
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,962
LET'S PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF IT.

138
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,296
>> THERE COMES A TIME WHEN ONLY

139
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:09,900
A FEW ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE A

140
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,869
DIFFERENCE, BUT THE QUESTION IS,

141
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,605
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IF YOU

142
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:14,938
MAKE?

143
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,740
BE PART OF THAT WORLD WHERE THE

144
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,440
DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE READY

145
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,509
TO BE OPENED.

146
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,546
INVESTMENT FROM AROUND THE WORLD

147
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,748
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE MEDICAL

148
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:26,450
BREAKTHROUGHS, AND ABUNDANCE OF

149
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,518
RESOURCES, INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY

150
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,553
RESOURCES, INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOG

151
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:30,320
TECHNOLOGY, AND NEW DISCOVERIES.

152
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,155
WHAT IF?

153
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:32,956
CAN HISTORY BE CHANGED?

154
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:34,958
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK

155
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,194
ABOUT THAT, GENERAL?

156
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,962
>> I THINK THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY

157
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:39,863
BASED ON OUR INTELLIGENCE AND

158
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:40,597
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE

159
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:44,167
KIM JONG UN'S HEAD IS, AS BEST

160
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,969
AS WE CAN DETERMINE.

161
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,371
EDUCATED IN SWITZERLAND,

162
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,572
TRAVELED AROUND EUROPE, AND

163
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:49,940
UNDERSTANDING OF THE WEST.

164
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,376
40-50 YEARS IN FRONT OF HIM IN

165
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:52,676
POWER.

166
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,378
HE WANTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR

167
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,045
HIMSELF, FOR HIS FAMILY, FOR

168
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,980
THAT COUNTRY.

169
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,782
THE STATUS QUO HE CURRENTLY HAS,

170
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,183
WHICH IS TENSION AND CRISIS, IS

171
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:00,884
SOMETHING I THINK HE WANTS TO

172
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,586
MOVE AWAY FROM.

173
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,955
AND THAT IS WHY THAT VIDEO WAS

174
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:05,989
PRODUCED.

175
00:05:05,989 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Martha: AN INTERESTING
