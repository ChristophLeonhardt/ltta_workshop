some of the news here Joe president Trump issued another call for the special counsels investigation to end after the FBI terminated a senior agent Peter struck who was removed from the investigation into Russian interference in the election after an internal watchdog discovered that he traded negative text messages you'll remember about Trump the president tweeted agent Peter struck was just fired from the FBI finally the list of bad players in the FBI and the DOJ gets longer and longer based on the fact that struck was in charge of the witch-hunt will it be dropped it is a total hoax no collusion no obstruction I just fight back rights the president he later tweeted that struck had a lead role in what the president called the crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation adding it was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone so Joe there are questions raised first by Peter Struck's attorney about how this happened why it happened when it happened the firing of Peters truck is not what was originally recommended but but his attorney says was ordered by the Deputy Director of the FBI after pressure from President Trump for all these weeks and months on Peter struck yeah it's non-stop Willie and you know Nick conv story what I can't what I just can't deal with is the fact that these Republicans in Congress don't speak out more aggressively because the president United States yesterday again called the investigation into Vladimir Putin's interference in American democracy a quote witch-hunt despite the fact we've had dozens a couple of dozen of Russians indicted yet we had the press conference last week where the Director of National Intelligence said that that this is a grave threat to American democracy the red lights are blinking you had the Trump's FBI director that he appointed coming out saying the threat is there the threat is real the threat is not going away and you even had Kirsten Nielsen who is not exactly shown herself to stand up to Donald Trump in times where she should where she said the crosshairs of a mare American democracy itself is in the crosshairs because of what Vladimir Putin is doing and here you have Donald Trump calling it a witch-hunt and wanting to end the investigation into Putin's interference with American democracy well Joe in fact here are some important pieces here right there were three men who two years ago were at the start of this investigation into Russian interference James Comey the head of the FBI as number two was Angie McCabe and now Peter struck all three had been fired by the President or pushed out under pressure from the president so three people who led and oversaw and permitted this investigation into Russian interference in our country and our elections are all now gone and by the way they also as you know were overseeing the investigation to Hillary Clinton if you're going to pull back a little bit and think about the facts here it's undoubted that that the investigations of these two people Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump probably helped Donald Trump more in the beginning than they do now and yet here he is you know calling witch-hunt and going after these people and inserting himself into a personnel decision and it is you know something that gives you a bit of foreboding meanwhile at a federal court police in Washington yesterday a fourth federal judge rejected a challenge to Robert Muller's appointment as special counsel the judge Dabney Friedrich was appointed to the bench by President Trump last year the move to dismiss came from a Russian firm charged with conspiracy to defraud the u.s. arguing that an Independent Counsel violated the Constitution's appointments clause by creating an unaccountable branch of government Judge Friedrich rejected that argument and wrote that Muller had not strayed from his jurisdiction so pressure on Robert Muller from all sides with a decision in his favor yesterday in Washington well something I found to be interesting is you look at how the Muller investigation does send some action items up to New York and they're quick to say oh the Southern District can handle this but they are keeping certain items in their jurisdiction and keeping things closer to DC so I do find that interesting what is passed off as this is more this is a local issue and then oh this still has super seating issues of natural national interests what about the larger point though at least that people are not Republicans in particular that's standing up for the premise of the investigation the premise of the special council's work which is not specifically obviously a witch-hunt to go after Donald Trump but a broad investigation into something everyone including every Intelligence Agency under this president knows to be true that Russia interfered in the 2016 election continues to do so today well I think you're seeing most of the theatrics on the house side I mean certainly there are senators Republican senators who could do more to stand up for this investigation but they really are biding their time and looking to just get through midterms and so to push this off as much as possible to see what effect Donald Trump is actually going to have when voters go to the polls in November why and you know Heidi again we have to do this every time Donald Trump calls this investigation into Russian interference a witch hunt again a witch hunt is something where you're wildly going around like Joe McCarthy and you're making accusations and you know well you find next to nothing I mean in in this case you've had the president well first of all we've talked about the dozens of Russians that have already been busted for trying to interfere in American democracy you've got the president's campaign manager that helped put him over to the top and and helped him at the RNC in he was arrested he's being tried right now you've had national security advisor Michael Flynn who was arrested pled guilty and is cooperating you had his his assistant campaign manager Rick Gates who pled guilty was arrested pled guilty and is cooperating with authorities you have his campaign adviser who he told The Washington Post was one of his two top campaign advisers George papadopolis arrested pled guilty is cooperating with authorities this is no witch-hunt and how rich is it that yesterday Russians were argue in federal court the same thing Donald Trump argues and the same thing Donald Trump supporters argue which is Robert molars investigation must come to an end he doesn't have constitutional authority to do what he's doing so regardless of what happens with Peter struck and the sideshow of the attacks by this Congress in the house particularly on these Department of Justice and FBI officials the investigation goes on you named you ticked off all of the numbers and we're now getting close to getting answers about the fate of Paul manna four and let's remind people what the goal of a lot of this is it is to squeeze these individuals for additional information about the president's own role in all of this about his knowledge for instance about what happened at Trump Tower and these are the people who are going to give us those answers so you can just deduce from the president's own behavior of these increasingly frantic tweets waking up first thing in the morning to try and and again push this narrative of it being a witch-hunt about what his level of concern is that we are at this this stage of the process and what it means for himself potentially so this investigation will go on regardless but I do think that in terms of the significance of Peter struck the concern there I think is that there is also an emboldened the hill you have on the one top on the one hand a silent majority who is not speaking out and then on the other hand folks like Devon Nunez who now want to take this as further ammunition to go after additional people I saw a conservative website yesterday Joe say out with struck in with or other in other words Bruce or whose yet another FBI official that they're going to put a target on his back yeah a lot of people yesterday on the hill claiming a scalp and Peter struck yesterday and the president tweeting that as well meanwhile the attorney for FBI special agent Peter struck as I mentioned as suggesting his clients firing amounts to a purge of the bureau Horan destructs lawyer ate on Goldman the FBI's office of Professional Responsibility ultimately decided that struck should face a demotion a 60-day suspension and a last-chance probationary agreement but the lawyer said FBI deputy director David Bowdich overruled that decision and ordered structs termination in a statement struct lawyer said the decision to fire struck is not only a departure from typical bureau practice but also contradicts director raised testimony to Congress and his assurances that the FBI intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters on MTP daily yesterday that attorney mr. Goldman added this I don't think that you can rationally reach any conclusion other than it was political there's no not a scintilla of evidence that any of peace' political opinions affected his job and in fact you can read the IG report who says that Pete was one of the more aggressive people on the Hillary Clinton email investigation and if he had wanted to somehow impact the election he could have easily done it and did not do it so michael steele the FBI has not made a statement about this yet exactly but his attorney heard there mr. Goldman said the Office of Professional Responsibility at the FBI recommended something different which was a suspension and some kind of a punitive measure but not a firing and that the Deputy Director of the FBI stepped in and canned Peter struck yeah and I'm almost certain that that deputy director got some marching orders to do that and to go outside what is the normal procedure and protocol for these matters you know is a is a at least a yellow flag if not a red flag that there was an undercurrent here something else that was driving this decision you know his lawyers Struck's lawyers are going to pursue this of very openly and very publicly and again here's the bottom line it's one more attack assault on the FBI and the institution as a whole and on top of everything else that it has to deal with you know the one thing it can hold on to which is why it was so stressed in those hearings is that we have a process we have proceed Jers that we try to do and that we do execute by the book if it is shown that you've gone beyond that it's another blow to the agency and again at the hand of the of the administration itself so it's it's one of those things that you know the public's confidence in the FBI is already rattled because of the incessant belligerent approaches taken by the administration and if it's shown internally that their works to undermine its processes to get at the truth and to expose the truth than that again is further undermining of the agency as a whole all right we've got a ton more to get to this morning thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
