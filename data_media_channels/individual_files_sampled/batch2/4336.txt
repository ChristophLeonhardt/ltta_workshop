you're talking about murders you're talking about very very very violent criminals do you know how many ms-13 members you caught here that have made it through I can tell you right now we're looking at a 300% increase over last year and how many how many people is that comes up to about a hundred and I think it's 180 and how many total people did you catch last year last year we had a hundred and eighty-seven thousand people welcome back to our three-hour special edition of am joy live from Tornillo Texas now although the white house and its allies routinely use ms-13 to fear monger and to justify their immigration crackdown in fact ms-13 and criminal gang arrests make up just a tiny fraction of the total apprehensions at the border Jacob Soboroff unpacked that and much more in a new Dateline special the dividing line which airs tonight at 7:00 p.m. on NBC and Jacob joins me now so Jacob let's let's the first of all start with some facts on ms-13 Donald Trump loves to use them as a talking point in his speeches his allies and conservative media talk about them constantly what is ms-13 and is it a Central American invasion of the United States all right so let's let's start at the beginning ms-13 is a Los Angeles Street gang that began in the parking lot of a 7-eleven in Koreatown in the city of Los Angeles and during the Clinton administration many members of that gang who were undocumented immigrants were deported to Central America terrorized residents of Central America expanded massively and then caused some of the migrant refugee crisis that we're seeing on our borders today so the American policy of deporting these folks instead of just locking them up in our jails and then deporting them we're figuring out a different strategy is what caused some of what we're dealing with right now I want to be really really clear about what you just heard from Manuel Padilla the border patrol sector chief in our Dateline special you feel more of it tonight he said a hundred and eighty of a hundred and eighty seven thousand people they caught her ms-13 members the whole policy of separating children and locking them up is pretty clear and 100 180 out of a hundred and eighty-seven thousand so I'm not very good at math but I believe that is point one percent joy of all the people apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley sector were ms-13 members and this whole thing was predicated by Donald Trump on the idea that people are fraudulently coming into the United States and that's why I have to separate families and lock up children it's the math is funny math fuzzy math and it doesn't make any sense based on the statistics that we know about and beyond that let's talk about what people actually are fleeing we know that there is something called the northern triangle that is in Central America that a lot of these families are coming from places like Guatemala and El Salvador can you explain and does your special go into some detail on what it is these families are actually fleeing desperation they're fleeing gang violence they're fleeing persecution and they want a better life in the United States which has historically been a welcoming place for migrants from around the world who are looking to seek asylum and have a better tomorrow and so when you hear again the administration say you have fake families coming into the u.s. fraudulent family units that are really terrorists or gang members the percentage on that one is 1% 1% of all of the families caught in the Rio Grande Valley sector the epicenter of this migrant crisis we'll talk about it tonight on Dateline are false 1% of all of the families and again based on that 1% statistic the president and his administration decided in a systematic way in a way it has never been done before to separate families from children resulting in tonight today 2,000 kids 2053 to be exact according to the numbers of the administration potentially never being reunited with their parents again because I was told this morning by Homeland Security that a large percentage of those parents may already have been deported back to their home countries that that is one of the things I think has been the most disturbing Jacob Baker your reporting this morning and the idea that parents of these two thousand plus kids may already be outside of the United States because it's not clear what the process would be for them to get back into an American courtroom to claim their children or to even locate them that's correct I mean again these are not folks that are wealthy individuals they're some of the most desperate poor people you know in the world quite frankly and that's why they're coming here so when you get deported from the United States after coming here to try to seek asylum albeit in between ports of entry then you're kicked out of the country and your child remains effectively incarcerated or at least in the custody of the US Department of Health and Human Services what are you supposed to do you don't have the resources to pick up the phone to hire a high-priced attorney in order to go and track down your children and these phone numbers these 1-800 numbers that HHS is saying you know are provided to be reunited what do you do when you're in what do you do when you're in Central America and trying to dial these numbers and trying to figure out where your child is yeah and the other issue of course is is Mexico which is where many of these families are traversing through Mexico to get to the United States if you get into a little bit of a situation there because it's not as if it's easy to get through Mexico able to get to the United States in the first place so Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries in the world and that is fair Donald Trump makes very clear that he feels like the reason we need a wall and the reason we need to incarcerate children separated from their parents is because Mexico's violent and he thinks that that may be spilling over into the United States we go to the morgue and the special tonight in Tijuana the most violent city in Mexico where six people are murdered a day it's absolutely overflowing over 1,700 murders last year alone this year is expected to be on pace to pass that but guess what joy if the president took the time to pick up his own DEA reports and read maybe one page or two pages of those annual reports he would learn that spillover violence is not something that happens in the United States Tijuana Reynosa Juarez are dangerous cities in Mexico but on the other side of the border San Diego McAllen El Paso those are some of the safest big cities in the United States of America he's ignoring the statistics his own government puts out in order to cherry-pick and put forward fraudulent bags to make border policy and that's how we got here today and it wasn't just Trump you know we've got we have had deterrence as a border policy for 20 years starting in the Clinton administration it's resulted in people dying in the desert going around an existing infrastructure trying to run away from the Border Patrol and a failure to address that as how we ended up with kids in cages in over the course of the last week yeah and not to mention the fact that Mexico has a has elections coming up not having a great relationship with the US administration doesn't exactly make it easy to them to cooperate in trying to solve some of these problems take up silver off thank you so much for all the reporting that you have done on this issue thank you very much we'll be watching
