“We are right on the eve of
the legalization of trees
in Canada.
At 12 o’clock midnight, you
can smoke what you want,
take hits from the bong.
Canadians, make some noise!”
It’s a new era for Canadians —
the full legalization of
marijuana across the country.
It’s been legal to
consume cannabis here
for medical reasons
since 2001.
But now, anyone in Canada over
the legal age can get high.
And that means Canada’s
booming weed business
is about to get a
whole lot bigger.
We went to see some
of the producers who
are set to take advantage
of this opportunity.
“It’s got kind of a
citrusy and pine smell
both at the same time.
This is one of the Kushes.
It’s got more of a
turpentine, maybe
a little more earthy smell.
This is a very
popular strain for us.
We call this
deep purple, very fruity.”
Warren Bravo was a
co-founder of Green Relief,
a medical marijuana
company that
is now well-placed to enter
the recreational space.
He’s aiming to increase
production 20-fold
over the next year and a half.
And that’s nothing
compared to
Canada’s top
marijuana producer:
Tweed Inc., a brand
of big-time operation,
Canopy Growth.
One vault here can
hold about $150 million
worth of cannabis.
“Yeah, so in this
facility, on this side
that we’re
touring here, we have
24 flowering rooms and
then about another 24
on the other side as well.
This is, at the
end of the day,
what all of the fuss and
excitement is about, I guess.
When we reached
out the first time,
I think, you know, 
the New York Stock Exchange
probably, you know,
rightly said, ‘No way.’
You know, we’re not
having a cannabis company.
And then that
education process started.
And if you try to break
down these barriers,
and demonstrate we’re
a normal company
creating a normal product
like anyone else.”
And it’s a product
that’s becoming
a formal field of study, fast.
“We’re running the only
postgraduate certificate
program in cannabis
in Canada.”
Bill MacDonald
teaches a class of 24
highly dedicated students,
that includes
a former police officer.
“It did take
some reconciliation
because I was, obviously,
on the other side.
But it’s in society.
It’s out there, now.
So, if we’re going to have it
and it’s going to be here,
let’s control it properly.”
That’s the thing — 
for people who
were hoping for a free-for-all
and one-love openness,
it’s a disappointment.
“Cannabis is going
to be legalized
in certain contexts,
but it’s also going
to be very heavily regulated.
And my concern is that
people don’t recognize
the extent to which it will
still, in certain contexts,
be illegal.
And that might bring them
in conflict with the law.”
“African-Canadian people,
our community is very afraid
to now come out and actually
be a part of this market,
because we’ve been
criminalized for so long.”
Noni Haynes is part
of a group leading
a discussion on
new cannabis laws
at a local
community center.
“And who is making
money from the weed?
Not the average person.”
“I don’t know if
you don’t know,
we live in a
capitalist society.
And, you know, within
capitalism, anything goes.”
“That’s a very good point.
I mean, now is
the opportunity.
If you capitalize on that,
you have your business,
or you grow your business,
you expand your clientele.
And you treat it like
an actual corporation.”
A few days
before legalization,
we came to a kind of marijuana
farmer’s market in Toronto,
at Planet Paradise.
In the past
few years, this place
has been tolerated by police.
But now, fines have
been ramped up,
and the organizers
here are shutting shop,
worried about a crackdown.
“We’re planning on not really
having anything like this
till we see where the
law is going to go.
Because we don’t want to have
a bunch of issues ourselves,
right?
So we figured we’d
have one last hurrah,
just to get people
together and smoke.”
We travelled to an
indigenous Mohawk territory,
another place where marijuana
is openly sold illegally.
There are over 40 unlicensed
dispensaries here.
Jamie Kunkel owns one
of them, Smoke Signals.
He’s not worried.
“The amount of customers that
we go through, I believe,
is going to increase because of
the system that they’ve set up.
They’re not providing
the Canadian constituency
with a reasonable place
to purchase this plant.
I personally think they’ve set
themselves up for failure.”
Jamie is pointing to
the fact that there
are no legal
brick-and-mortar dispensaries
in the province of Ontario.
Lawful purchases
must be made online,
and those do not include
any of the cannabis-infused
products sold here.
“Milk chocolate
espresso beans,
milk chocolate almonds.
Jeez, you know, I was
really looking forward
and hoping it was
going to be the salsa.”
Canada is only
the second country
in the world to legalize
cannabis after Uruguay.
But it’s the first
major economy
to run this experiment.
And whatever it
leads to,
Canada will be
leading the way.
