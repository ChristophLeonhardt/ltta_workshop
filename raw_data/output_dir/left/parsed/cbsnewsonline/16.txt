MIDDLE EAST.
WE ARE STOPPING IRAN.
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO STOP, WE
ARE STOPPING IRAN.
WE TOOK AWAY THE RIDICULOUS DEAL
MADE BY THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION, THE IRAN DEAL
WHICH WAS $150 BILLION AND $1.8
BILLION IN CASH, WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?
THEY ARE AN ALLY AND WE HAVE
OTHER GOOD ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
SAUDI ARABIA IS AN ALLY AND THEY
ARE A TREMENDOUS PURCHASER OF
NOT ONLY MILITARY EQUIPMENT BUT
OTHER THINGS.
WHEN I WENT THERE, THEY
COMMITTED TO PURCHASE $450
MILLION WORTH OF THINGS AND $110
BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY.
THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST ORDERS IN
THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY.
PROBABLY THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD.
I DON'T THINK THERE HAS EVER
BEEN ANY ORDER FOR $450 BILLION.
YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY IN SAUDI
ARABIA WHERE THAT COMMITMENT WAS
MADE.
SO THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT ALLY
BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENED, WHERE IS THE FAULT,
AND WE WILL PROBABLY KNOW THAT
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.
MIKE POMPEO IS COMING BACK AND
WE WILL HAVE A LONG TALK.
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MAN
WHO LIVED ACROSS THE RIVER IN
VIRGINIA.
WHY NOT SEND THE FBI IN TO
FIGURE THIS OUT?
>> WELL, HE WASN'T A CITIZEN OF
THIS COUNTRY.
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR
NOT WE HAVE, DO YOU?
>> WELL -- HAVE YOU?
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.
WHY WOULD I TELL YOU?
>> YOU ASKED FOR THIS AUDIO AND
VIDEO INTELLIGENCE --
WE HAVE ASKED FOR IT.
IF IT EXISTS.
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THEY
HAVE NOT TURNED IT OVER?
>> NO.
I'M NOT SURE IT EXISTS.
IT POSSIBLY DOES.
I WILL HAVE A REPORT ON THAT
FROM MIKE WHEN HE COMES BACK.
THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST
QUESTIONS I ASKED.
>> THERE WAS TALK ABOUT SPENDING
BEING REINED IN ON CAPITOL HILL?
>> WE WILL ASK EVERY SECRETARY
TO CUT 5% FOR NEXT YEAR.
LAST YEAR, FIRST YEAR, I HAD TO
DO SOMETHING WITH THE MILITARY.
IT WAS FALLING APART, IT WAS IN
VERY BAD SHAPE.
THAT'S WHY WE WENT FOR 2 YEARS,
$716 BILLION.
THAT TOOK PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF
TWO YEARS.
WE HAVE PURCHASED AND
REPURCHASED JETS, MISSILES,
ROCKETS, ALL FORMS OF MILITARY
EQUIPMENT, SHIPS, SUBMARINES.
WE HAVE REBUILT THE MILITARY TO
A LEVEL THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN
BEFORE.
I HAD TO DO THAT.
IN ORDER TO GET THE $700
BILLION, THOSE NUMBERS HAVE NOT
BEEN HEARD OF, I HAD TO GIVE THE
DEMOCRATS, I GIVE IT WASTE
MONEY.
THINGS I WOULD NEVER HAVE
APROUFBED BUT WE HAD TO DO THAT
IN ORDER TO GET THE VOTES
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
REPUBLICAN VOTES TO DO THIS
WITHOUT THEM.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BORDER,
THAT'S BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS
WANT IT TO BE BAD BECAUSE THEY
DON'T GIVE US THE VOTES.
THAT'S WHY I HOPE WE DO WELL IN
THE MIDTERMS.
BUT WE WILL ASK FOR A 5% CUT FOR
EVERY ONE.
OKAY.
WE WILL SEE YOU AT THE CABINET.
I WANT TO TALK TO THE GREAT
FOLKS AND WISH THEM BEST WISHES.
THEY HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB
AND WE APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE WILL SEE YOU IN A COUPLE OF
MINUTES.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE
RESPONDING TO A FEW QUESTIONS AS
HE IS RESPONDING.
HE IS GOING TO ASK SOME CABINET
MEMBERS TO CUT 5% IN THE WAKE OF
A BOOMING DEFICIT, JUMPING 17%.
YOU ALSO HEARD CBS RADIO
CORRESPONDENT ASK A QUESTION TO
THE PRESIDENT ON IF HE HAD SEBT
THE SENT THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE
THE WHERE ABOUTS OF U.S.
RESIDENT JAMAL KHASHOGGI, THE
PRESIDENT NOTED THAT HE WAS NOT
A CITIZEN.
AND HE WOULD NOT ANSWER THAT
QUESTION.
IN FACT, HE SAID YOU DON'T KNOW
IF I SENT THE FBI OR NOT, MAYBE
I HAVE, I'M NOT TELLING YOU, WHY
SHOULD I?
WE DIDN'T GET CLARITY ON THAT.
HE ALLUDED THAT SECRETARY OF
STATE MIKE POMPEO WILL BE
RETURNING FROM TURKEY IN THE
COMING DAYS AND AT THAT POINT,
HE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE
THAT HE MAY HAVE OBTAINED FROM
THE TURKISH AND SAUDI OFFICIALS
AND WHERE THE INVESTIGATION
STANDS AT THIS MOMENT.
NO MAJOR HEADLINES OUT OF THAT Q
AND A SESSION.
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP NOTED HOW
MUCH OF AN ALLY SAUDI ARABIA HAS
BEEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING
PRESSURE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO
FIRMINATE OR LIMIT THE $110
BILLION ARMS DEAL SECURED WITH
SAUDI ARABIA LAST YEAR.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE UPDATES AS
THEY COME OUT OF THE OVAL
OFFICE.
AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING
WITH HIS CABINET, WE WILL BRING
YOU HIGHLIGHTS FROM THAT AS
WELL.
AT THIS POINT, WE WANT TO TURN
TO CRIME EA WHERE AT LEAST 18
PEOPLE ARE DEAD INCLUDING THE
ATTACKER.
50 OTHERS WERE INJURED FROM AN
EXPLOSION AND A POTENTIAL
SHOOTING THAT PRECEDING IT ALL.
IT IS BEING
