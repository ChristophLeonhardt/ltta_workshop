>> DOES THINGS LIKE CALL
IMMIGRANTS ANIMALS.
>> THE DEFENSE IS THAT HE WAS
FOLLOWING UP BY A STATEMENT OF A
SHERIFF SAYING THIS IS MS-13.
HE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT MS-13.
GOOD ENOUGH?
>> NO.
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
IT IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE,
WHEN YOU START DEHUMAN MIZEING
PEOPLE THIS WAY.
THIS IS WHAT NAZIS DID.
WHAT SLAVE OWNERS DID.
NOT WHAT AMERICANS DO.
>> I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT
SHE IS TALKING ABOUT.
THE PRESIDENT, A COUPLE DAYS AGO
IN A CABINET ROOM AT THE
WHITE HOUSE WAS TALKING TO SOME
PEOPLE ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN THE
COUNTRY.
A SHERIFF FROM SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA MADE A COMMENT ABOUT
MS-13.
HE RESPONDED, REFERRED TO THEM
AS ANIMALS.
THEN MANY MAJOR MEDIA OUTLETS
REFERRED TO IT, AND REPORTED IT
AS THE PRESIDENT JUST CALLED
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY AS
IMMIGRANTS, ANIMALS.
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED?
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, I MEAN
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MEDIA IS
TO MAKE EVERYTHING THEY CAN
NEGATIVE ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
LOOK, MS-13 IS THE MOST VIOLENT
GANG IN THE WORLD.
THEY RAPE AND KILL IN ORDER TO
BE INITIATED INTO THE GROUP.
WHEN YOU BEAT SOMEONE TO DEATH,
HACK THEM WITH MACHETE, BEAT
THEM WITH BASEBALL BATS, CUT
THEM UP 100 TIMES I CALL THEM AN
ANIMAL.
WHEN I WAS A JUDGE I CALLED THEM
ANIMALS.
I PROSECUTED THEM.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.
BUT THE MEDIA WANTS SO MUCH TO
DESTROY DONALD TRUMP.
WHAT THEY'RE MISSING IS THE FACT
THAT AMERICA SEES THE GOOD
THINGS THAT HE IS DOING.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY CAN FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE
WHILE DONALD TRUMP, THE
PRESIDENT, JUST KEEPS COMING IN
AND DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR
AMERICA.
ED: NANCY PELOSI SAID YESTERDAY,
NO, THEY'RE ALL GOD AS CHILDREN,
EVEN APPARENTLY GANG MEMBERS.
>> SHE SHOULD BRING THEM TO HER
HOUSE TO LET THEM LIVE WITH HER.
ED: THE MEDIA WAS ALL OVER HIM
IN RECENT WEEKS ABOUT MOVING THE
U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.
GUATEMALA, OTHER COUNTRIES ARE
GOING TO FOLLOW AMERICA'S LEAD
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT IS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> I WAS IN ISRAEL FOR THE
OPENING OF THE EMBASSY.
IT WAS SUCH AN HISTORIC DAY.
AMAZING PART, GUYS, WHEN YOU GO
TO ISRAEL, EVERY SIGN ON EVERY
STREET CORNER WAS TRUMP MAKE
ISRAEL GREAT.
GOT BLESS DONALD TRUMP.
IT WAS ALL TRUMP AND THE SADDEST
PART IS THAT WE DON'T DO THAT
HERE.
JUST LIKE THE OTHER SEGMENT.
LET'S SAY EVERYTHING WE CAN THAT
IS NEGATIVE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.
BUT THEY LOVE HIM THERE, AND I
WAS THERE FOR THE OPENING IN
FACT INTERVIEWED, ONLY
INTERVIEW --
ABBY: WE HAVE A CLIP OF THAT
INTERVIEW JUDGE.
>> OKAY.
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
MADE HISTORY.
THIS WILL BE REMEMBERED THE WAY
WE REMEMBER THE PROCLAMATION OF
HARRY TRUMAN WHO RECOGNIZED
ISRAEL.
THE WAY WE REMEMBER THE CYRUS
DECLARATION FROM 2500 YEARS AGO
WHEN HE TOLD THE EXILES OF
BABYLON YOU CAN GO BACK AND
REBUILD THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM.
THIS IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT AND
WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER IT.
HISTORIC.
WE CARRIED IT LIVE.
WE ALSO CARIED WAS GOING IN GAZA
ALONG THE BORDER.
>> RIGHT.
STEVE: IN THE DAYS AFTER THAT
ISRAEL WAS VILIFIED FOR
ENFORCING THEIR BORDER.
THERE WERE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM
HAMAS WHO HAD BOLT-CUTTERS AND
WIRE CUTTERS.
THEY WERE TRYING TO THROW BOMBS
AT THE ISRAELIS.
50 OF THEM DIED.
>> I WAS THERE AND I SPOKE TO
GENERALS AND PEOPLE IN THE
ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE.
HAMAS WAS PAYING PEOPLE,
ACCORDING TO REPORTS IN ISRAEL,
TO GO TO THE FENCE IN THAT AREA,
PLACING CHILDREN THERE.
THE IDEA OF RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
ARE SEVERE.
WHEN THEY MADE THE DECISION TO
KILL, AND THEY DID, I SPOKE TO
SOME OF THEN, IT WAS BASED ON
THEIR OWN SAFETY AND THEIR OWN
SECURITY.
HOW DO YOU HAVE AN 8-MONTH-OLD,
HOWEVER OLD THE BABY WAS WHO
DIED AT THAT BORDER WHICH IS ALL
FIRE, MOLOTOV COCKTAILS, PEOPLE
YELLING AND SCREAMING.
YOU KNOW, YOU END UP FACING THE
REALITY THAT ISRAEL WILL DEFEND
ITSELF?
ISRAEL DOES WHAT ISRAEL NEEDS TO
DO.
AND YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM.
THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO
WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM AND
KILL THEM.
IT WAS A GREAT WEEK LAST WEEK
TOO.
THE PRESIDENT PULLED OUT OF THE
IRAN DEAL.
BIBI CAME TO CONGRESS, TO WARN
US THEY WOULD CONTINUE ENRICH
AND CREATE WHAT THEY NEED TO.
ED: WE'LL SEE VIDEO.
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
ABOUT JAMES COMEY SATURDAY
NIGHT.
>> I WILL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT YOU TO SEE THE SHOW, THE
LAST QUESTION I ASKED NETANYAHU
SHOWED AN EXTREMELY DIFFERENT
SIDE OF HIM AND IT WAS VERY
TOUCHING.
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING AFTER
JAMES COMEY.
ABBY: THAT IS A TEASE.
ED: I TOLD YOU.
