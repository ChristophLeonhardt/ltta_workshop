a single email sent in 2016 set up arguably the most infamous meeting ever held at Trump Tower featuring three senior members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and a small group of Russians the man behind that one email joins us now British porn publicist and music manager Rob Goldstone his new book is pop stars pageants and presents how an email trumped my life Rob good morning it's good to see you good morning so let's talk about that infamous email what was your objective initially we should stipulate that you represent Ayman who was a big pop star and he was the one who reached out to you and said let's connect Trump jr. with with Rudd these Russian folks in the room so what what tell me how he came to you and what he wanted out of it he wanted a meeting for a Russian attorney actually with the Trump's Trump jr. was my idea I didn't know which Trump to go after there's a lot of trumps and so I kind of decided that almost I don't mean this the way it will come out almost the lowest rung on the totem pole was perhaps to go to John Jr because I was quite skeptical of what I was even talking about em and had been really vague with the information but had given me enough to create an email that I thought would get Don Junior's attention and the most important line for me and that email has always been maybe you should just speak with Emin about this directly and once they spoke in a phone call my email didn't get the meeting my email got the call the call got the meet so did Eman say to you my father or somewhere in Russia has dirt on Hillary Clinton and that's why I want them to meet know what he'd said was that are well connected either former or current prosecutor in Russia had met with his father that morning in Moscow and had some potentially damaging information about illegal Russian funding to the Democrats and their campaign I use you know I'd been a Fleet Street journalist which caddy will know just how impressive and how wonderful that is it was a publicist so I puffed up that email using the information he'd given me to get Don attention and I always said this email wasn't made up it was kind of made better and if the idea was to get his attention what I suppose it got his attention I just never imagined anyone other than John Jr would ever read one of these hundred and thirty-seven words I think Don jr. would I thought that first of all it was perhaps intriguing to know what this was it was I suppose it was so apt at that time that I thought this will probably get his attention that's actually why I added Hilary's name the one thing I regret more than anything in all of this the big one being pushing the send button but more than all of this was I never meant that it was Hillary who should be incriminated if Joe Biden had been running it would have said about Joe if Bernie Sanders about Bernie it was the extension of this funding illegally in some way to the Democrats and their candidate so I merely added that candidates name in there right because you did say specifically in the email information that would incriminate Hillary and her deal with Russia would be very useful yeah your father horrible phrase so you're suggesting Emin did not specifically identify her killer in' but never else would it have been that's what i thought she was gonna be the nominee that's what I did I'm not saying this was a brilliant piece of writing by any means it was written in three minutes to get Don juniors attention it was puffed up I never thought I know people find this hard to believe it would be read by anyone other than John Jr did did you think that the Russians had some kind of concerted effort to help Donald Trump and was any of that going through your mind when you're thinking well why would they want to give them incriminating why do they have this incriminating evidence anyway and why do they want to hand it over the Trump campaign I mean I actually thought it was perhaps perhaps a bit of grandstanding on behalf of the Aguilera's that perhaps this attorney I mean they're quite powerful within Russia but nowhere near at the level that they've been portrayed I mean Donald Trump famously said when he first met Emmons father arise the richest man in Russia has country and I wanted to jump in and go the 54th richest man in Russia has come to see you but no I didn't think that that's all I thought that that somebody they knew had asked them to get a meeting that person had turned out to be a lobbyist for the Magnitsky Act and that they had grandstanding gone of course we can get you a meeting with the trumps and then it went down like a like a game of telephone father - son son - Rob Rob - Don jr. the meeting Rob you were at the meeting I was you remember Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner at the meeting i sat next to Jared Kushner and I said alongside what was he there at the beginning of the meeting I believe he was did he stay for the entire meeting I believe he did tamanna for it there at the beginning yes did he stay for the entire meeting that I know because he was just in front of me on the way out you mentioned three candidates in 1920 16 second because Jared Kushner said he left early because he was so bored with a meeting and it was as a ruse but that's not your recollection my recollection is that we all left basically at the same including Jared including Jared now whether that he got up and dashed out you know and we all like behind a minute or two I don't recall any reason a majority to me the majority of me here in the meeting you recall Joe Biden's name being mentioned no you recall Bernie Sanders name being mentioned you recall Hillary Clinton's name being mentioned I'm not sure uh-huh I'm really not sure because at the beginning the attorney did open with some general remarks I have to also say and I know it's been reported on I was never supposed to be at that meeting I was supposed to do a handoff and Don jr. had said to me oh well why don't you just stay and you can take them out he did this gesture like take them out which to me was like heard these people out at the end right it will be a quick meal and in the meeting last 20 minutes maybe 25 minutes maximum do you recall anything that Don jr. asked the guests at the meeting the principal guests at the meeting asked only to make their presentation to be good the only person who made a comment before dawn kind of wrapped up the meeting was kushnir who after the attorney had presented what appeared to them I supposed to be very generic very general information about this supposed illegal funding to the Democrats Jared Kushner who looked increasingly agitated to me as I was looking at a quorum I said to her I have no idea what you're talking about could you possibly refocus and I remember that specifically because instead of refocusing the attorney maybe it's a translation issue began from the same part that had seemingly bored him to the points of light what we now know texting his assistant to say get me out of this meter so did Italian vets on the Disgaea the Russian Ettore offer as promised any dirt on Hillary Clinton or Democrats I don't know how you define Doug but this but the conversation started out with her talking about these would names I'd never heard of at the time and have heard many times now about how the ZIF brothers and Bill Browder had funded money to the Democrats which she believed was a bad thing because I think I don't remember it exact but I think it was because taxes hadn't been paid on this money and therefore it was dirty money but it was very generic and the only reason I remember that was because I looked over it in the direction of John Jr and thought funnily I suppose didn't your father used to donate to the Democrats also to me it made no sense and I actually wanted to almost interject and say that and I said no did anyone from the Trump side Don jr. Jared or mana Ford at any point express interest in the information that was being given them or asked for more of it or ask for follow-ups were there any kind of questions along the line of you know walk what else do you have what do you give us the only points that were brought out was Jared's comment which I mentioned I have no idea what you're talking about please refocus and then when the attorney pivoted and said what I really want to talk about is the issue of the sanctions of the magnets yet as it relates to adoption and then because my ears pricked up and I was like and you have to understand I I'm a music publicist none of this made sense to me right it was like we're now sitting in on a meeting about adoption what does that mean it wasn't long before Don jr. moved as if to get out of his chair and then the attorney said maybe it's something that you could look at should your father be patent he stopped it and just said my father's a private citizen so I would suggest you address this to the Obama administration at which point I jumped up and said thank you very much thank you goodbye so how did the mass so embarrassed so based on all the information that you had based on all the knowledge you had was it your understanding that Don jr. Manafort Kushner all of them were coming in to hear from a Russian attorney on how to get dirt from Hillary Clinton on Hillary Clinton I mean you have summed up what I believed sitting in on that meeting and why did it why did you believe that because my email had said that initially I'd set up a call between Eman and Don jr. originally remember that meeting was supposed to be between one Russian attorney and one Don jr. after that call took place I got the email that said now we'd like to also add poor man afford and in brackets campaign chairman and Jericho so my brother-in-law so after you sent the email saying talking about dirt on the Democratic candidate then it expanded from a meeting with Don jr. and the Russian lawyer to the campaign chairman the basically Kushner who basically was running large chunks of the campaign not after my email after the phone calls well that I wasn't on that phone call and as an as I've said a few times I'm sure that's one of the things I would imagine that robert muller and his team are very interested no reason to believe that donald trump knew that this meeting was going on i have no reason to believe it one way or another what I would say is if my father was running for president of the United States or of anywhere else and I was having a meeting a floor or two below where he was in his conference room with some Russians to discuss what's been laid out human nature would say that I would tell my father yeah so do I know if he told his note but I'm just telling you what I would there's been some questions around a phone call that took place right after that meaning did you see Don jr. make a phone call as he walked out no have you been interviewed by the special counsels office I have posted by the grand jury and can you characterize that interview what did what was their understanding of the meeting do they have knowledge of the the content and the characters in the room I'm sure they have knowledge of it they asked me for I think I was very much viewed as I described myself once as being a little bit like zelich the Woody Allen character that I kept appearing at these bizarre moments in from Russia so I think that without any reason so I think they saw me as something of an independent voice that had no agenda I wasn't with the Russian side I wasn't with the Trump side and as a result I just told a much longer version of what I told you but the meeting I found that was only a small part of what they wanted to know they had many other questions and the meeting to me is a piece of a much larger puzzle in the grand jury did any of the grand jurors ask you questions they did not there were two questions that were submitted while I was out and they were logistics questions how much did you get the impression the special counsel knew that had not come from you how much corroborating information did he have in his questioning to you they had interviewed I cavil Adso who was also a representative of the Aguilera's who was there he had been interviewed before me so they had his evidence outside of that I'm not sure I mean it was very much a very methodical very logical experience especially because it has come hot on the tail of me having done some Capitol Hill interviews which were maybe a little less logical and regular so I actually found a special counsels process to be to make perfect sense and to be much more comfortable if that's the right word in understanding yep all right all right the Boston Stars pageant some presidents how an email trumped my life it's out today Rob Goldstone thank you very much pleasure I'd like to cover all the selfies with your next book yes I sure would take over yeah okay first thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up to date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
