hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to revision</font>

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,840
videos I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> three exams so far</font>

3

Spanish was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay not wonderful geography</font>

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,460
was appalling the most painful thing in

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,110
my entire life because the glacis paper

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,929
was like torture and the third one was

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">English which I had today which was you</font>

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,680
know the paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I was no</font>

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,100
fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard was he not easier but</font>

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,140
was went better than I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,760
people that I thought was gonna find

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,880
easier I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the essay was</font>

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,260
fantastic so hit the BET Hip it balances

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">so my next and last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exam is philosophy</font>

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,320
and that's when friday and there was a

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot to learn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about philosophy check him</font>

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,670
out I had to learn photography you take

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,930
the amount that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had tonight English</font>

20
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,530
then times it by about 500 and then you

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,940
still haven't got as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hike a</font>

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,940
leopard and philosophy so I'm gonna get

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,890
some more videos so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't like</font>

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,110

25
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,449
stop stop watching these are watching

26
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,379
stop stop now thank you my friend is

27
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,809
annoying me all the time down there self

28
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,940
with ethics which basically attempts to

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,860
answer the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> what auto dude there</font>

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">are three types of ethics there's</font>

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,369
normative ethics applied ethics which is

32
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,170
day-to-day kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Drive Emma's that we</font>

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,760
make in our conscious mind and met

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,979
ethics which discusses the nature of

35
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,110
concepts such as what's good or bad and

36
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,060
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we mean when we say good or</font>

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,049
bad we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these in our</font>

38
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">subconscious minds first you must start</font>

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,680
with normative ethics and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start</font>

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,090
with something called consequentialism

41
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,380
the only thing that we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

42
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,689
consequentialism was utilitarianism so

43
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that</font>

44
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,600
utilitarians basically believe that

45
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,189
people's ultimate point is happiness

46
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,470
this connection to<font color="#E5E5E5"> human nature is why</font>

47
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">their theory must be white the theory is</font>

48
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Terry illogical which means that there</font>

49
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,229
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an end or purpose as in we should do</font>

50
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">X because there is an end or purpose to</font>

51
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,250
it believes strongly an impartial<font color="#E5E5E5"> ality</font>

52
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,560
and egalitarianism so the happiness of

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,540
any one person cannot be more or less

54
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,009
important than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the happiness of another</font>

55
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,240
person and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course it's a</font>

56
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,740
consequentialist theory which means that

57
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">one must act to secure the best</font>

58
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,340
consequences there are few criticisms of

59
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,380
this immediately first there is the main

60
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,450
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with justice an innocent person</font>

61
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,250
being punished me make a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

62
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy but there's something about it</font>

63
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,880
that just doesn't seem right then

64
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,649
there's a problem with obligations and

65
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,389
promises can you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a promise</font>

66
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,220
just to please more people is that

67
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,280
justified

68
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,050
and then the whole consequentialist idea

69
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,640
is also difficult but it's hard to

70
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,130
recognize what the consequences of the

71
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,050
situation will be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean there are loads</font>

72
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,240
of examples of these websites splitting

73
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,880
the atom for example did not have the

74
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,230
best consequences when you make a

75
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,940
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font>

76
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's the right decision but</font>

77
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,120
you never understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full extent of</font>

78
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,640
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision and surely intention is a</font>

79
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,670
big part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that decision making process</font>

80
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,770
and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not your decision is</font>

81
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,650
valid but utilitarians don't really take

82
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account then there's a</font>

83
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,230
situation called Jim and the Indians

84
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,580
which is referred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot through</font>

85
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,110
philosophy as a guy called Bernard

86
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,650
Williams who posed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

87
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">traveler</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who generally comes across this</font>

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,280
South American town in that town there

89
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,320
is a captain and soldier pointing a gun

90
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,690
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have lined up against a</font>

91
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">wall 20 Native Americans Jim some</font>

92
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,530
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene asked what happening</font>

93
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,380
and the captain says that these people

94
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,530
of protesters and that the captain<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

95
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,910
going to kill them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all because this will</font>

96
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,680
stop other people from protesting the

97
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
captain says as your travel gym i'll

98
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,329
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you this great opportunity you can</font>

99
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">kill one of them because you've got that</font>

100
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,390
honor and then I'll free all the other

101
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,829
ones or if Jim doesn't agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he'll</font>

102
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,650
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill them all anyway so um what</font>

103
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,220
what Jim to do should he kill one person

104
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,329
saving all these other lives or kill

105
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,910
know people and lead to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consequence</font>

106
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,400
of everyone dying cuz the questions

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,380
would probably say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should kill one</font>

108
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,720
person but it matters to gym whether or

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,150
not he kills one person thus with each

110
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,859
return<font color="#E5E5E5"> ism there is a very big problem</font>

111
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,440
with integrity the main interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arian</font>

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,530
theory is classic utilitarianism which

113
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,840
is called hedonic utilitarianism or

114
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,420
direct or act this is the theory that

115
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,950
one should always act to maximize

116
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,930
happiness or minimize unhappiness of

117
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,820
those affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by one's actions the</font>

118
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,260
hedonic side a bit is that classical

119
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,180
utilitarians complete happiness can be

120
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,160
attained by pleasure and they believe

121
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we cope in a moral dilemma by</font>

122
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,579
assessing every act in terms of its

123
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,290
consequences without concerning

124
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,790
ourselves with any other apps that we

125
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,920
have done in the past all with intention

126
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,779
this relies strongly on the idea of

127
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,488
commencer ability which is when two

128
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:21,190
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can become compared in terms of</font>

129
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,289
the same units and concepts and so on

130
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:24,560
and hedonism

131
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,220
and it means devotion to pleasure you to

132
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,070
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terrans believe that humans always</font>

133
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,020
motivated to champagne and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pursuit</font>

134
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">pleasure this guy called Bentham thought</font>

135
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,850
that will subconsciously to come to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">greatest happiness principle the</font>

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,520

147
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,430
producing pleasure the certainty that it

will result<font color="#E5E5E5"> in pleasure and their</font>

property how long you have to wait for

150
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,470
that pleasure there are some criticisms

151
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,490
about this because there's a lot

152
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,919
difficulty in assigning clear value<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,479
things such as duration I mean how do

154
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how long it's gonna last you</font>

155
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,720
rate them all out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 but what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

156
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,430
do when things<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out equally also</font>

157
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,050
Bentham says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be used</font>

158
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,700
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> moral decisions but as a</font>

159
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,350
consequentialist surely everything is

160

you're aware that it was as the greatest

could something be a moral<font color="#E5E5E5"> dilemma until</font>

168
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,380
you will use the greatest happiness

169
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,840
principle specific calculus because that

170
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense there are some good</font>

secular so it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to all people it</font>

has that direct connection with human

176
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,700
nature and it seems common sensical but

177
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,380
just because it is common sensical does

178

gosh reef is gone but I'm still voting

191
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,850
team Alex some criticisms of classical

192
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,830
utilitarianism a big criticism because

193
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,229
it attacks the foundation of classical

194
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:32,990
utilitarianism essentially is the train

195
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,700
that humans are in pursuit of pleasure

196
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,030
not pain

197
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,860
humours pursue things that aren't

198
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,380
necessarily pleasurable like they forced

199
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,640
their children to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to school sometimes</font>

200
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,130
when you know kid isn't necessarily

201
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,890
enjoying it to read character because

202
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,270
they feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you give them an</font>

203
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,340
education when if the taught even if the

204
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,720
child is it necessarily enjoying it so

205
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,850
they claimed that humans are in pursuit

206
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pleasure not pain isn't always</font>

207
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,750
accurate the impartiality aspect of it

208
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,340
doesn't seem realistic it doesn't seem

209
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,440
in keeping with human nature is putting

210
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,450
your friends and family or loved ones

211
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,960
alongside others and treating equally

212
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,520
really plausible I mean if a<font color="#CCCCCC"> god man was</font>

213
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,650
holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gun to a stranger's head into</font>

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,560
would you pick to<font color="#E5E5E5"> save I mean it doesn't</font>

216
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,960
seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be have a connection to human</font>

217
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,760
nature at all it also takes into account

218
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,920
no other emotions such as guilt it only

219
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes into account pleasure and</font>

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,220
happiness and then in terms of happiness

221
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,750
itself to be happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't necessarily</font>

222
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,300
have to be enjoying yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> some would</font>

223
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,330
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that monks for example and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to</font>

224
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that kind of zone and focus because</font>

225
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,680
they didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> distractions and</font>

226
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,290
that's where true contentment lies

227
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,490
finally what makes you happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font>

228
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">always what there for you if you enjoy</font>

229
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,040
drinking coke all the time like I do

230
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,930
then that's great but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

231
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">wat your teeth and then that's not very</font>

232
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">good for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but there are some other</font>

233
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,180
branches on you to meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arianism such as</font>

234
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,070
welfare utilitarianism which makes

235
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,350
decisions based on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> best interest or</font>

236
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,570
preference between terrorism which asks

237
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,400
you what we'll what you prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I rather</font>

238
