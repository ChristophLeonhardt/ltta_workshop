day 505 of the Trump administration and special counsel Robert Muller has filed new charges against the former Trump campaign chairman it is even more clear tonight that Paul Manafort is in a world of trouble earlier today mana fort was indicted on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice for allegedly trying to tamper with witnesses in his case as we've reported Muller's team is seeking to have mana for its bail revised or taken away entirely over these allegations late tonight men afford responded to Muller's bail filing saying the accusations of attempted witness tampering are based quote on the thinnest of evidence Manta Ford is due in court on June 15 to find out if he will immediately head to jail the same obstruction charges were also brought today against Manta Ford's longtime Russian associate konstantin Kaleem mnek today's indictment said that around February and April of this year quote the defendants Paul mana Ford and Constantine columbic knowingly and intentionally conspired to corrupt Lee persuade another person with intent to influence delay and prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding josh Gerstein of Politico who joins us in just a moment reports today quote a source familiar with the case called the indictment brutal for mana fort paul's problem is he doesn't actually have anything to trade the source added cooperating isn't an option because he really didn't collude with the Russians at the Trump campaigns request Paul mana forts team had no immediate comment on today's indictment but earlier this week the spokesperson said mana Ford is innocent and nothing about the allegations changes his defense Ken Vogel over at The New York Times reports that mana forts associate this Constantine calumny quote has studied as a linguist at the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow he initially worked as a translator in Ukraine for mister mana fort who speaks neither Russian or Ukrainian and became a progressively more integral member of mr. mana forts team eventually run the Kiev office for mr. men affords firm well earlier today former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul spoke to re Melbourne about this columnist possible ties to Russian intelligence agencies he was well known working with Manta Ford and he was working in Ukraine but he's a Russian national working in Ukraine and the world of intelligence services just generally is murky and and to say that he worked for the GRU or the SVR I don't know that for sure but from my general experience in the region would he have relationships with those kinds of organizations my answer that would be probably yes and we should note that of course column NIC has denied links to Russian spy agencies meanwhile on his way to the g7 summit in Canada earlier today President Trump spoke about a whole host of issues from porn stars to his upcoming summit with Kim jong-un he also discussed his pardons and the Russia investigation did you believe that you are above the law no no no I'm not above the law I never want anybody to be above the law but the partners they're a very positive thing for a president I think you see the way I'm using them and yes I do have an absolute right to pardon myself but I'll never have to do it because I didn't do anything wrong and everybody knows it there's been no collusion there's been no obstruction it's all a made-up fantasy it's a witch hunt I haven't even I haven't even thought about it I haven't even took I haven't thought about any of it it's certainly as far too early to be thinking about that they haven't been convicted of anything there's nothing Department it's far too early to be it is far too early to be thinking about it and it's the President and Rudy Giuliani continue to paint the Russia investigation as a witch-hunt and a hoax Philip bump of The Washington Post points out that today's news quote brings the investigation by Muller to a total of 20 individuals and three businesses that have either been indicted or admitted guilt and a total of 75 charges filed by the year-old probe one third of the counts included in Muller's indictments 25 of them target men afford let's bring in our leadoff panel for a Friday night the aforementioned Josh Gerstein senior White House reporter for Politico Jeremy bash former chief of staff at both CIA and the Pentagon and Jill wine banks here in New York with us veteran attorney and former Assistant Watergate Special Counsel welcome to you all and Josh I want to begin with you because you were present for part of this today even at a point before which you knew what you were witnessing tell us what you saw well I was down at the federal courthouse and there was considerably more activity than usual involving the mauler team we saw Andrew Weissman the lead prosecutor on the mana fork case and one of Muller's top deputies coming into the courthouse there was comings and goings by another Muller prosecutor by the name of Kyle Ferrini as well as several FBI agents and there were signals with them going back and forth into the clerk's office that perhaps the grand jury was preparing to return in an indictment and indeed by the early afternoon there was a notice posted outside one of the courtrooms that just that had happened that there had been a session where an indictment had been handed up although it was not immediately clear who was being indicted or why it certainly seemed like manna fort was alive possibility for what would be the second superseding indictment the third indictment total in Washington DC given the very serious tampering alligator that Muller leveled earlier in the week and for some civics 101 an indictment means 23 members of a grand jury have found reasonable cause that a crime might have been committed and Jeremy bash the presence of this Russian in today's document the presence of this Russian perhaps in our society how was today different what just happened in this case well it's the first time Brian that the Muller special counsel team has really drawn a direct link between the Trump campaigns Chairman Paul Manafort and an official with ties to the Russian government there have been other Russians who have been indicted by the special counsel but heretofore we do not have one that has specific ties to the Russian government and this individual Constance Inc olymic is a Russian army trained linguist he was doing pro-russian government propaganda in Ukraine for the for the Yanukovych regime you'd have to believe it's an entire coincidence that he would be a private actor a Russian national living in Ukraine living in Kiev but actually having no ties to the Russian government yet doing their bidding so obviously nobody believes that and people do believe that he has a Russian government Nexus so what is it alleged Jeremy that he was doing in our country especially in and around our presidential election well if there is a if there is an effort by manna Ford and a Russian government official to advance pro-russian propaganda to advance the Russian government's view of policy and to inject themselves into politics that's precisely what they were doing during the 2016 campaign and it shows an element of sophistication an element of capability an element of expertise by Paul Manafort with this Russian government official in doing exactly that and there's a possibility that's exactly what they were doing during the 2016 election so Jill wine banks put another way there's a chance that this Paul man afford American citizen was working against the home team during a presidential campaign a couple questions for you how was the screw further turned on mana for today and what are your remaining about this case I have very few remaining questions it's just a question of how soon he's going to end up in jail because these are serious charges and are very valid grounds for revoking his bail and putting him in jail and remember this is not the first time that he has violated his conditions of being free he wrote an op-ed that he wasn't supposed to have written and he stayed free after that but this is the second time and the indictment has some very specific pieces of information texts that were written and exchanged in a phone call that showed that they were really trying to change the testimony of witnesses to hide the fact that they were colluding in America to influence policy of toward Russia and the Ukraine and these are these charges we're talking about our heavy federal time some of these are twenty years each if he gets nicked by a portion of these he dies in prison well he does just on the indictment even before today he would have had a life sentence basically if you add up all of the charges currently pending against him so if he's convicted just on the substantive charges without his having tampered with witnesses which is one of the most serious things that judges and federal prosecutors are concerned about is when people actually tamper with the justice system by trying to change the testimony of witnesses hey there I'm
