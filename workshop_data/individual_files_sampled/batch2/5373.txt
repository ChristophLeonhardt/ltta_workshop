welcome back the man who once declared he'd take a bullet for president Trump is now figured early the speaking firing one at him Michael Cohen's lawyer gave CNN a recording of a conversation with his then client Donald Trump about buying the rights to former Playboy model story Karen McDougal claiming a months-long affair now the tape shows that contrary to White House statements President Trump did in fact know about the proposed payoff two months before the election even if he ultimately never made the payment as his legal team says Cohn appears to tell mr. Trump about his plans to set up a shell company to buy the story rights from the national Enquirer's publishing now the publisher paid turned mcdu $150,000 for a story and for the right to kill it we should note that NBC News hasn't confirmed that the original recording was an edited or altered here is a key part where Cohan seems to refer to publisher head David pecker I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David you know so that I couldn't do that right away I've actually come upon to be and I just spoken to Alan weiselberger about how to set the whole thing up President Trump blasted Cohen in a tweet this morning asking quote what kind of lawyer what kind of a lawyer would tape a client so sad some might ask why would somebody hire a lawyer like this that's another question joined now by Mimi Roca MSNBC legal analyst and a former assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York why me I think that a lot of focus has been on what's on the tape when more the more important aspect in all this may be the fact that Michael Cohen chose to publicly disclose the tape why is it more important in your mind and frankly the minds of most legal analysts that just the action of Cohen doing this is so meaningful forget what the substance of the tape is well Chuck I think it's signals in a sharp way what he's been signaling for the past couple of weeks which is his break and loyalty from Trump as you said at the beginning everyone knows that he famously or infamously said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump and it is that loyalty that needed to sort of be broken in order for him to psychologically really be able to come around and decide to cooperate and I don't know that if he's taken any actual steps to do that with prosecutors but you know I think that doing something like this trying to really expose Trump in the way that he has really you know again signals and blinking lights that he wants to cooperate okay yeah but but I'm curious you as a prosecutor and former prosecutor wouldn't you feel more comfortable if Michael Cohen just called you up and said hey I want to talk absolutely something I show you like what I don't get is why by a billboard because essentially what he did is he bought a billboard and he went ahead and bought a billboard in Times Square to say hey give me a deal right why why I do this publicly I agree I don't think it's a good strategy quite honestly he wants to cooperate he should keep his mouth shut and go talk to the co-operators and not talk to the press and not be on this PR campaign but for whatever reason I do think I sort of you from from when he erased Trump from his Twitter you know when he erased him the Trump Organization I view this as his public breakup and he literally needs to have a break with him this is someone he looked up to him was very close to this reminds me of almost every mafia case I did for about six years in the US Attorney's Office and I'm telling you that the best consigliere has to suddenly feel feel scorned well the I mean yes I think Trump did a lot here to sort of push Cohen if he ends up in the arms of the government because he really didn't do himself any favors by sort of sidelining him you know in the past couple of months but you know the best co-operators in the organized crime world and elsewhere are the people who were them the most loyal to their sure supervisors or bosses because they they know the secrets and the whole point as you pointed out I mean the fact that Trump is complaining now about Cohen's sort of underhandedly taping him which it is underhanded and no legitimate lawyer would do that but that's exactly why Trump picked Cohen as his lawyer he didn't go out and get a real lawyer he picked Cohen because he would do the dirty that kind of dirty work he was a specific resume and a specific willingness exective on that resume exactly not your normal and I guess what do they say about spurned lovers right they can be that the most vicious and however you want to whatever this relationship is yeah that's how a bit should let me ask you this why isn't it what why shouldn't we interpret it him is begging for a pardon why could it be a flashing billboard for that or is this his response of finding out he can't get one so I mean you know this is getting in the really deep in the mind of Michael Cohen but you know mr. avenatti has been out there saying that he does think this is Cohen appealing for a pardon still i I don't think so because I think that there are so many things that he has said there are sort of irreversible at this point about Trump he's not just sending signals anymore he's shouting from the mountaintops bad things about Trump things that are damaging or could be damaging to Trump and so if he's looking for a pardon for a man like Trump I don't think he's gonna get very quickly Alan why Solberg he is the lone guy from the Fred Trump era that is sort of stayed with Donald Trump the whole time should he be getting his own lawyer I would if I were him I mean it the way his name comes up on this recording I think this recording is a not standing alone but is a good piece of evidence that prosecutors could use particularly with mr. Cohen if he cooperates against weiselberger and others in a conspiracy charge all right Mimi Roca thank you for providing your expertise Southern District in New York expertise they're useful these days so thanks for coming on sure newbies a red flag for Republican signs that the big blue Midwestern Democratic wall that collapsed in 2016 it may be on the way to being rebuilt that's next hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on youtube subscribe now
