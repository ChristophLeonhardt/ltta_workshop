00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:17,903
THE CROWD LOFERRED HIM.

00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:21,073
HIM WILL JUST HATE HIM MORE.

13
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:22,674
THE MEDIA PATS ITSELF ON THE

14
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:23,842
HEAD FOR NOT COVERING IT

15
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:26,178

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,559
SOLDIERS BACK FROM NORTH

25
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,427
KOREA WEEK AFTER ISSUE WAS

26
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:42,761
RAISE.

33
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,106
MEANING NOT A MONSTER AT

35
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:56,909
THAT'S WHY OPTIMISM IS HIGH.

36
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,544
95% OF MANUFACTURERS HAVE A

37
00:00:58,544 --> 00:00:59,678
POSITIVE COMPANY OUTLOOK.

38
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:00,813
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

39
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:02,948

40
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:05,717
AND ABOUT THOSE ELITES.

44
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,325
WHY ARE THEY ELITE?

I'M RICHER THAN THEY ARE.

51
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,273
I BECAME PRESIDENT AND THEY

52
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:30,008
DIDN'T.

53
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:39,418

LOYAL, BEST PEOPLE ON EARTH,

57
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:44,289
THE DEPLORABLES.

58
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:47,125
REMEMBER THAT?

59
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:47,926
>> Greg: THAT'S KEY.

60
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,061
BRAG SOMETHING NEVER

00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,028
APPEALING BUT IS HE NOT

62
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:50,429
WRONG.

63
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,898
THAT BY WEALTH HE IS AN

64
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:54,533
ELITIST, YET, HE IS STILL

65
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,301
EMBRACED BY WORKING CLASSES.

66
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:59,137
NO WONDER THE DENIROS, UPON

00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:01,006
DOES ALL UNRALPH, TRUMP IS

68
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,274
RICHER THAN THEM ALL BUT

CLOSER TO THE STREET THAN

70
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:03,575
THEY ARE.

71
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:04,943
HOW CAN THAT BE?

72
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:06,678
THE ANSWER IS HE MAKES

73
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:09,481
PROMISES AND FIGHTS TO KEEP

74
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:09,914

75
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,650
BESIDES FOR YOU DEPLORABLES

DEEM YOU TO BE THE UNCOOL

KIDS.

80
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,156
TRUMP DEFENDS YOU AGAINST

81
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:18,757
THE JERKS.

82
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:20,058
IT'S NOT ABOUT WEALTH OR

83
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:20,459
APARTMENTS.

84
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,460
IT'S ABOUT SPEAKING UP FOR

85
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,095

88
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,198

00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,067

105
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:51,490
MY AUNT DONNA IS THE ONE WHO

106
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,858
DOES THE HAIRCUTS IN THE

107
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,493
KITCHEN EVERY COUPLE WEEKS

YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING

110
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:56,762
ABOUT TODAY.

111
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:58,797
I WAS TRYING TO THINK ONE

112
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:00,899
OTHER PERSON WHO HAD THIS

113
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:01,800

00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:04,069
CELEBRITY.

116
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,470
STILL CONSIDERED BLUE

118
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:06,805

CLINTON EASTWOOD.

121
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:09,041
I THINK IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE

122
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,776
OF THE ART THAT HE CHOSE.

123
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:13,045
THE WAY HE CHOSE TO -- THE

HE IS ALSO A MAN'S MAN.

141
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,667
YOU SPEAK ABOUT THESE MAN

ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S

148
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:46,211
APPEARANCE BECAUSE THEY MAY

00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:49,081
BE ACCUSED OF BEING

150
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:49,481
INSENSITIVE.

151
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,216
DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN

CAN I SMELL A CONTRACTOR.

159
00:03:58,857 --> 00:03:59,891
IT'S TRUE.

00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,959
AS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER

161
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,361

HE ALSO EATS FAST FOOD.

166
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:10,235
NOT FOR A PHOTO OP. BECAUSE

167
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,871
HE ACTUALLY LIKES IT.

168
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:14,706

THEY LIKED THE PLANES.

180

THEY LIKED THE STYLE.

181
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,055
THEY LIKED THE JETS.

182

00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,452
LIKE THE ELITE ESTABLISHMENT

202
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:04,122

APARTMENT.

212
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:17,469
HIS APARTMENT IS BETTER THAN

213
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:23,542
THEIR APARTMENT.

214
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,177

>> Greg: IS HE BEING FUNNY.

220
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:32,350
>> Juan: I DON'T THINK HE IS

221
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,885
BEING FUNNY, THAT'S HIM.

222
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:35,754
I GOT A BETTER APARTMENT SO

223
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:39,424

00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:45,030
SAY THAT HE -- HE COULD BE

228
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,198
IN THAT GROUP BUT YOU LOVE

00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:50,669
>> Juan: NO, NO, NO.

232
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,305
I WILL TELL WHAT YOU IT WAS.

233
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,072
>> Greg: IT WASN'T INSULTING

234
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,475
TO ANYBODY.

235
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,944
>> Juan: WORTHY OF MOCKERY.

236
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,312
MY APARTMENT IS BIGGER THAN

00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,713
YOURS, MY BUTTON IS BIGGER

238
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:02,347
THAN YOURS.

239
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:03,081
THIS IS HOW HE TALKS.

240
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,850
HOW HE RELATES TO PEOPLE

241
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,517
THESE OTHER CELEBRITIES

242
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:06,218
DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF

243
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:06,985
THE WORKING MAN.

244
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:07,953
LET ME JUST TELL YOU

245
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:08,787
SOMETHING, I'M NOT SURE HE

246
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:09,921
HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE

247
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,490
WORKING MAN ON SEPARATING

248
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,257
CHILDREN FROM PARENTS.

249
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:12,958
I DON'T THINK HE HAS THE

250
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,092
SUPPORT OF THE WORKING MAN.

251
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,128
WHAT HE DOES IS.

252
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:17,162
>> Greg: HE BROUGHT THEM

253
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:19,297
TOGETHER NOW.

254
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,499
>> Juan: HOT BUTTON ISSUES

255
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:21,066
AND FEAR.

256
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:21,700
YOU CAN HATE HILLARY

257
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,067
CLINTON.

258
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,536
HE HAD THE CROWD LAST NIGHT

259
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:25,737
CHANTING LOCK HER UP.

260
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:26,905
HE CAN SAY THINGS LIKE GO

261
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:28,306
HOME TO YOUR MOM TO THIS

262
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:28,573
GUY.

263
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:29,908
WHY DON'T YOU GET A HAIR

264
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:30,175
CUT.

265
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:31,209
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A MAN

266
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,844
OR A WOMAN.

267
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,146
>> Greg: THAT'S A TERRIBLE

268
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:35,847
IMPRESSION, JUAN.

269
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:36,615
>> Juan: HE HATES ON

270
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:36,948
CLINTON.

271
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:40,085
HE HATES ON EVERYBODY THEN

272
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:42,320
HE SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

273
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,755
MAYBE WHOSE HISPANICS, THEY

274
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:47,759
ARE TERRIBLE, TOO.

275
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,593
>> Greg: WHAT'S THAT BEEN

276
00:06:48,593 --> 00:06:48,960
HISPANICS?

277
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,996
I MISSED THAT I THINK HE

278
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:52,430
MEANT MS-13.

279
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,732
>> Greg: HIS APPEAL IS BASED

280
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:56,101
ON HATEFUL LANGUAGE AND HE

281
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,302
APPEALS TO THE WORSE.

282
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,104
>> Greg: SO WE'RE ALL BAD

283
00:06:59,104 --> 00:06:59,838
PEOPLE.

284
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:00,272
KIMBERLY?

285
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:00,939
>> Kimberly: I THINK AMERICA

286
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:01,306
IS GREAT.

287
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,140
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS

288
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,608

00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:07,412
SOMETHING.

292
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:08,346
HE HAS ACTUALLY FOLLOWED

294
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:11,550

WHY WOULDN'T SOMEBODY BE

00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,834
HAPPY ABOUT THAT?

309
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:30,869
LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT FOR
