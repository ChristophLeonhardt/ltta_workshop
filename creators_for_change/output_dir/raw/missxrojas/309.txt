happened while<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was buying women's ammo</font>

44
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,390
and it just was bad part for a book I

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hilary Jordan that's this book here</font>

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,659
cover for it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the cover</font>

during<font color="#E5E5E5"> Book Expo America when I got this</font>

50
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,680
year before last I really liked reading

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,750
it as a response text to the scarlet

52
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,250
letter I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of felt like that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,990
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> angle to read it from the stories</font>

54
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,579
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a young woman called Hannah who</font>

55
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,500
after being arrested<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having had an</font>

64
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,790
every four or five months or so because

65
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,229
otherwise certain things deteriorate

66
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,759
inside of you and you'll eventually

67
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,799
wither away and die<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because they</font>

this way it's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of an adventure</font>

93

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,680
been slowing it down a bit recently just

105
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,270
