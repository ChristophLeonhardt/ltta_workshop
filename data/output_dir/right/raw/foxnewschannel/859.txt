00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,207
[♪♪♪]

2
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:06,042
JESSE: WELCOME TO "WATTERS

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:11,648
WORLD."

4
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:15,084
I'M JESSE WATTERS.

5
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:16,686
POLITICAL PARTIES USUALLY ROOT

6
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,788
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

7
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:22,058
WHEN ONE PARTY FAILS, THE OTHER

8
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,693
RETURNS TO POWER.

9
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:26,529
BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE INVESTED

10
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,831
SO MUCH IN TRUMP'S FAILURE THEY

11
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,568
ARE ROOTING FOR AMERICA TO FAIL.

12
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:32,969
HERE IS BILL MAHER.

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,674
>> I FEEL LIKE THE BOTTOM HAS TO

14
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:40,243
FALL OUT AND I AM HOPING FOR IT.

15
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:42,679
ONE WAY YOU GET RID OF TRUMP IS

16
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,414
A RECESSION.

17
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:48,117
EITHER ROOT FOR A RECESSION OR

18
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:49,953
LOSE YOUR DEMOCRACY.

19
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:52,255
JESSE: HE WANTS AMERICANS TO

20
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:54,457
LOSE THEIR JOBS AND THEIR MONEY

21
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,826
SO TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING GOES

22
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:57,927
DOWN.

23
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:04,700
IT'S EASY FOR MAHER TO ROOT FOR

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,171
A FAILING ECONOMY BECAUSE HE'S

25
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,172
RICH AND FAMOUS.

26
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:12,041
>> HIP HIP MORE RAY,

27
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,042
UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN.

28
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:15,478
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO ME IN MY

29
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:15,778
LIFE.

30
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:20,416
JESSE: KEEP TALKING, NANCY, YOU

31
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,986
ARE HURTING THE DEMOCRATS.

32
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:25,488
THE MEDIA ATTACKED PROGRESS ON

33
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:26,656
THE PENINSULA.

34
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:28,791
>> A SUMMIT IS NOT AN

35
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,394
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THIS AMERICAN

36
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:32,595
PRESIDENT IT'S A MAJOR

37
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:35,632
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR KIM JONG-UN.

38
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:38,034
BOTH MEN ARE LIARS.

39
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:40,003
KIM JONG-UN LIES AND HE SAID

40
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,638
DONALD TRUMP LIES.

41
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,640
>> THIS IS NOT A DATE.

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,308
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

43
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:47,644
THIS IS NOT JUST LUNCH.

44
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:50,113
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

45
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:52,715
JESSE: I THOUGHT THE DEMOCRATS

46
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,251
WERE ALL ABOUT DIALOGUE AND

47
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,486
GIVING PEACE A CHANCE.

48
00:01:56,486 --> 00:02:00,289
THE WORST WAS CHELSEA HANDLER.

49
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:01,958
PUTIN IS GIVING TRUMP TALKING

50
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,726
POINTS AND ACTIONS TO TAKE TO

51
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:06,029
UNDERMINE THE VERY COUNTRY HE'S

52
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,096
FROM.

53
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:10,199
WE HAVE A DOMESTIC ENEMY RUNNING

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,370
OUR COUNTRY, PISSING ON ALL

55
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,007
ALLIES, AND SHOWS FEALTY ONLY TO

56
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:18,441
PUTIN.

57
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,543
THIS IS NOT AMERICA.

58
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,378
THIS IS RUSSIA.

59
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,380
I HOPE KIM JONG-UN EATS DONALD

60
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,914
TRUMP.

61
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,517
WE HAVE THE LEFT CALLING THE

62
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:30,753
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A

63
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:35,324
DOMESTIC ENEMY COMPARING HIM TO

64
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:38,161
A DICTATOR AND ROOTS AGAINST

65
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:38,828
PEACE.

66
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:41,330
JOY BEHAR AT THE VIEW PUTTING

67
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,966
THE CHERRY ON TOP SPEAKING ABOUT

68
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:47,103
OUR STRICTER SOUTHERN BORDER

69
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:47,437
POLICY.

70
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:49,138
>> PEOPLE SHOULD NOT TOLERATE

71
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:49,906
THIS.

72
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,541
THIS IS LIKE GERMANY.

73
00:02:51,541 --> 00:00:00,000
I MEAN, COME ON, PEOPLE.
