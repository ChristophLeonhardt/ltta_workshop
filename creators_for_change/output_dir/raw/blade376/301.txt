13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,809
out here especially when I joined

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,239
YouTube over a year ago and asked the

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,640
same question where<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all the UK</font>

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,829
youtubers when I was at University which

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,570
I finished about a month or two ago

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,219
losing track of time here I met<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,559
a friend there called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob and we were</font>

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,000
discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this you know UK</font>

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
youtuber thing and i invited him to the

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,629
London<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering which I organized with</font>

23
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,869
quite she and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> vision for that event</font>

24
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,119
was it was a chance of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,670
UK who don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exposure usually to</font>

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,860
step forward and show themselves and as

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,530
a result I began to learn lots about

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,220
loads<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new youtubers from the UK and I</font>

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,280
was saying how it is mainly us dominated

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,850
well it's changed now and they've given

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,280
us our own UK platform now the

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,229
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about this was Robert</font>

33
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,420
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a YouTube Britain like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a which</font>

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> center picture to this and I</font>

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,439
fought yeah why don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tube do that</font>

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,320
and have a UK section for all the

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,649
countries in the world like other sites

38
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,210
like live video that'd be great exposure

39
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,460
for people from different languages

40
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,799
different cultures etc and then you have

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall one wearing all links</font>

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,580
together

43
00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:02,400
which that plane would shut up so and i

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,830
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see geriatric 1927 and i was</font>

45
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,970
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask him a question about it</font>

46
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,930
don't you think there should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,300
exposure for people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK to which</font>

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,070
he said he<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that question</font>

49
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,230

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,690
reason why and it is now present that

51
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,590
