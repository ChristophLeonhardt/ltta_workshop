13
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:29,995
SO WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:31,963

ARI, IS IT RUSSIA, RUSSIA,

00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:37,469
RUSSIA?

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,803
>> RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA IS

21
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:40,038
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM,

22
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:41,306
PROBLEM, PROBLEM FOR THE

23
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:42,707
DEMOCRATS UNLESS MUELLER HAS

24
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:43,575
GOT THE GOODS.

25
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:44,542
IF MUELLER DOESN'T, THE

26
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:45,977
DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONE TRICK

27
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:47,912
PONY AND THAT PONY AIN'T

28
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,448
RIDING ANYMORE.

29
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:52,550
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

30
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,986
INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING INTO

31
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:55,720
SCANDAL.

32
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,488
STEVE: ULTIMATELY, THE

33
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:57,255
DECISION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:58,456
HAVE IN NOVEMBER WHO DID

35
00:00:58,456 --> 00:00:59,824
SOMETHING FOR ME?

36
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:00,558
WAS IT THE REPUBLICANS WHO

37
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:02,160
DID THE TAX CUT WHICH THE

38
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,395
DEMOCRATS REGARD AS CRUMBS

39
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:04,495
ON THE WAY TO TALKING MORE

40
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:05,462
ABOUT RUSSIA, RUSSIA,

41
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:05,997
RUSSIA.

42
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,866
>> AND IT'S NOT ONLY THAT.

43
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:09,167
IT'S HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS

44
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,302
THE FACT WE HAVE 3.9%

45
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:11,736
UNEMPLOYMENT.

46
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:13,038
THE PRESIDENT IS WISE TO

47
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:14,873
KEEP BANGING ON THE FACT

48
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:15,807
THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN

49
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:16,441
HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT

50
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:17,142
ALL-TIME LOW.

51
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,377
CAN HE ACTUALLY MAKE UP GOOD

52
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:20,678
NUMBERS WITH THOSE

53
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:21,479
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS.

54
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,580
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT

55
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,215
NUCLEAR OUT THERE, THE

56
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,517
PRESIDENT'S GROOFL WAS AT

57
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:27,452
58% IN DECEMBER AND NOW DOWN

58
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:28,486
TO 58% THIS MORNING.

59
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:30,288
IF THAT NUMBER GETS BELOW

60
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:30,555
50.

61
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:31,856
THAT IS HUGE FOR REPUBLICANS

62
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:32,991
RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION

63
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:34,426
BECAUSE THAT TAKES A LOT OF

64
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:35,527
THE ENERGY AWAY FROM THE

65
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:36,861
DEMOCRATS WHO CAN'T STAND

66
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:38,229
DONALD TRUMP AND THAT'S WHAT

67
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,297
DROVE A LOT OF THE TURNOUT

68
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:40,498
FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN THE

69
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:43,401
SPECIAL ELECTIONS.

70
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:44,469
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT SORT

71
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,937
OF MESSAGE THE DEMOCRATS DO

72
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,272
COALESCE AROUND AS YOU GET A

73
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:48,440
LITTLE CLOSER BECAUSE RIGHT

74
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,941
NOW IT'S A LITTLE UNEVEN.

75
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,176
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT

76
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,877
THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.

77
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,512
THE SMART MAN AND WOMEN DOWN

78
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,480
IN WASHINGTON WERE GOING

79
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,948
WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKED

80
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:58,349
ABOUT THE TARIFFS AND THINGS

81
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,417
LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T DO

82
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,452
THAT.

83
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:01,653
BUT, IT'S THE LITTLE GUY.

84
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,721
IT'S THE FORGOTTEN AMERICAN

85
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,589
WHO IS GOING THEY ARE

86
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,391
SITTING ON THEIR COUCH RIGHT

87
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,759
NOW GOING DAMN RIGHT!

88
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,561
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW ELSE YOU

89
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,461
KNOW THAT'S TRUE?

90
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,996
WHILE MUCH OF THE PRESS ONLY

91
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:14,132
QUOTED REPUBLICANS WHO

92
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:14,966
OPPOSED TARIFFS.

93
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,668
THEY NEVER QUOTED THE MANY

94
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:18,203
DEMOCRATS THAT SUPPORTED

95
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:19,504
NOW I HAVE NEVER BEEN RAISED

96
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:20,839
TO BELIEVE IN TARIFFS?

97
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,340
BUT IS HE TAKING ON CHINA.

98
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,842
THAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE

99
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:24,542
THAT DONALD TRUMP DESERVES

100
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:25,210
CREDIT FOR.

101
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,177
HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT

102
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:27,178
DEMOCRATS HAVE WITH THEIR

103
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:27,512
MESSAGE.

104
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:30,615
RIGHT NOW, OUTSIDE OF THE

105
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:31,216
MUELLER INVESTIGATION,

106
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:32,984
DEMOCRATS' ONLY MESSAGE IS

107
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:33,818
GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTHCARE.

108
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,920
HIGHER TAXES AND DONALD

109
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,855
TRUMP COMMITTED TREASON.

110
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:37,755
THAT'S THEIR POLICY

111
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:38,123
PLATFORM.

112
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:39,791
IT'S NOT A VERY STRONG ONE.

113
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,492
STEVE: BUT, THERE ARE SOME

114
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,327
PEOPLE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO THAT

115
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:42,694
PERFECTLY.

116
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:43,828
>> SOME PEOPLE DO.

117
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:44,863
AND THAT WILL BE THE LIBERAL

118
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,131
WING THAT PUSHES THE PARTY

119
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,633
LEFT IN THE 2019-2020

120
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:50,368
PRIMARIES.

121
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,202
ENERGY AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

122
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:53,671
IT'S THE INTENSITY OF

123
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,139
OPPOSITION.

124
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:54,772
STEVE: PLUS MOST OF THE

125
00:02:54,772 --> 00:00:00,000
MAINSTREAM MEDIA BEATING THE
