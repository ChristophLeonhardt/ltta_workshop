00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,970
second time i recorded this oh my gosh

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,370
life is YouTube is so hot this is a

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">dream stag video the tag was originally</font>

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,059
sought by Kristina Horner Kelly hide he

6
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,650
was now left me to go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the USA</font>

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,960
tagged me in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video tag so I guess</font>

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,160
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tag is to talk about</font>

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,020
your best dreams no worries but I ever

10
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,050
have any good dreams and I have had like

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,390
four or five good dreams maybe over the

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">past three years or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,849
ridiculous I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do man anything</font>

14
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,369
except nightmares which is really really

15
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,170
fun those good dreams<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I did have</font>

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,000
all involved sleeping with celebrities

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,280
so when I dream good i dream good guys

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,719
my nightmares which<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like every</font>

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,760
dream have a theme of people chasing me

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,079
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's like the general thing</font>

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,969
normally people chasing me with a weapon

22
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,640
normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's knife or a gun and the</font>

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,260
thing is they ways turn out to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

24
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,940
I know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like while sometimes it is</font>

25
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,340
easy to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> why that person came to my</font>

26
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,230
dream other times it's really weird and

27
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">random and I had a really really</font>

28
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,399
horrible version of this a few years ago

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,980
like around the time of 64 mine when I

30
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,859
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sixth form and I was like weirdly</font>

31
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,500
pregnant and I had these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three people</font>

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,140
running after me like just racing racing

33
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,549
off to me with knives like massive

34
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,260
knives and they stopped me almost like

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,430
weird more like something that was

36
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,070
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfamiliar to me and they got the</font>

37
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,290
knives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they cut out the baby from my</font>

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">stomach and then like ran off with it</font>

39
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,790
and they turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to be three of the</font>

40
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,869
teachers from my school I wasn't

41
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly anxious that exam wise at</font>

42
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,619
the time I hadn't really you know i only

43
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">spent the normal amount of time with</font>

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,619
those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was it was weird that</font>

45
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,619
turned into that crazy dream but yeah it

46
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,970
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> always turn out to be people now</font>

47
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,979
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do often die in my dreams which I</font>

48
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,630
know isn't supposed to happen but yeah I

49
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,210
often die like bleed to death where I'm

50
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,070
shot or whatever it's great the next

51
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,530
kind of earliest<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing I can remember</font>

52
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is of being chased by these really crazy</font>

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,689
like a female<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clone things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

54
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,000
humanly to like seven and a half feet

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,619
maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something ridiculous</font>

56
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:56,759
there's an episode of sabrina the

57
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,110
teenage witch which wasn't actually out

58
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,869
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a gonna start having</font>

59
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,430
this dream so it wasn't from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

60
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,200
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Raquel Welch in it Raquel</font>

61
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,060
Welch was is like really huge hats like

62
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,098
big round hats it shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> us obviously she</font>

63
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,389
has this amazing figure so it's kind of

64
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an exaggeration of that but the</font>

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">waist of these women</font>

66
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,620
because they were like women even though

67
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,990
they were frozen in in crazy smiles and

68
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,820
stuff their<font color="#E5E5E5"> waist kind of went into it</font>

69
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost nothing like when you twist a</font>

70
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,580
balloon like when you're making balloon

71
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,320
animals it was really really creepy and

72
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,680
they had like this bright<font color="#CCCCCC"> catsuits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

73
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,380
bright blue cat suit on and that was

74
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">very similar to like whatever they make</font>

75
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,780
disco pants on out of and yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

76
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,070
hat was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same shade of blue and</font>

77
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,630
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had these really maniacal</font>

78
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,100
smiles anyway they would chase me like

79
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,540
up the hill that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was near my house and I</font>

80
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,610
would every time go into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

81
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,130
house<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a nearby I don't think</font>

82
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,260
actually really exists by we go into it

83
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,480
I would always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hide somewhere in</font>

84
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,340
the front room just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like anywhere so I</font>

85
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,600
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of had an idea of what was</font>

86
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,460
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'd always look up into</font>

87
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,840
these big bay windows and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there would be</font>

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,580
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these crazy women like looking</font>

89
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,620
down at me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll just come in and</font>

90
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,160
like take me away it was so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so scary I</font>

91
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,080
hated her so much I did a cover not the

92
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">trips</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and my dreams and a lot of this</font>

93
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,590
must be like about ambition a lot of it

94
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,120
is about stress in the grand scheme of

95
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,560
things like those are actually the good

96
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,780
dreams of had some dreams are a lot sad

97
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,670
and I think it's when they relate more

98
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,230
directly to my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've had any</font>

99
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,640
variations on it before but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had this</font>

100
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,600
one dream that a really really good

101
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,370
friend of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> was dead I was allowed to</font>

102
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,810
go to the funeral and all my friends

103
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,330
were now to go everyone who who knew him

104
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,160
was allowed to go but I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to</font>

105
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,230
go I was like stuck outside the church

106
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,030
crying they're like the people coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

107
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,440
telling me all the reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wasn't</font>

108
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowed to go to the funeral which was</font>

109
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,550
horrible it's a horrible dream I woke up

110
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,709
crying and texted all my friends I was

111
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,070
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> help and then after my dad</font>

112
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,020
died that has some really messed up

113
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,060
dreams I've only had like three dreams

114
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,020
and in which my dad is like starred

115
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,640
directly and one of them was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font>

116
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,650
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wiggly infantile I was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting</font>

117
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,480
in front of our fireplace in the house I

118
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,160
grew up in and was just like stroking

119
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,020
this cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk it was</font>

120
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,480
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the like</font>

121
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,580
tamer ones and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I had immediately</font>

122
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,920
after you died was I was waiting outside

123
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,959
my house<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for my dad's driving to</font>

124
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">theatre and he like never turned up</font>

125
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,750
really really late with day he was

126
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,040
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come quite early in the day</font>

127
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,260
and he like came down the road to call

128
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,029
my house was like walking towards

129
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,620
theatre which I knew was really far away

130
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,779
I started shouting at him like you

131
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,910
didn't come your spouse he was supposed

132
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come like take me to the theater and</font>

133
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you promised you'd come you do</font>

134
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,790
tom was a huge like screaming screaming

135
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,740
augment<font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say much he was</font>

136
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,030
kind of like cross that I was shouting

137
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">at him whatever and I like got into his</font>

138
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,190
car somehow and somehow had his keys and

139
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,050
I can't drive in real life or in dream

140
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,120
life I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving this car to this</font>

141
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,650
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater but I was so out of</font>

142
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,480
control everything was like swerving

143
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,620
massively and I think that's a big part

144
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,030
of it like feeling like I was out of

145
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,670
control but I was just swerving hugely I

146
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,100
could hear like sirens behind me and

147
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,950
then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> crashed so that was really fun</font>

148
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm pretty sure I died in that dream as</font>

149
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,610
well or at least was knocked out so that

150
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,770
was great and then the fire team going

151
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,600
to talk about is even creepier and

152
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,490
weirder and like slightly more

153
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,590
depressing my dad was alive for 15 more

154
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,330
minutes and we knew he'd have a stroke

155
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,300
again I was just me in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

156
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,650
like a number of things I'd been told

157
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,540
would like a jatate his strokin would
