1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,390
- You know, we've seen it
certainly in this World Cup

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,390
where players have exaggerated,
perhaps, some fouls.

3
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:12,274
(somber violin music)

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,650
This goes back to the speed of play.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,370
The naked eye could only see this so fast,

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,270
and these players are
moving at tremendous speed,

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,870
and pace, and have a lot
of physical strength.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,460
And so, what may seem
like an exaggeration,

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,150
in some cases, is simply
speed and physicality.

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,350
It doesn't take much to throw
a player off of their balance,

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,060
or get them slightly off on
their touch, or what have you.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,160
It doesn't take very much.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,770
So, part of it is judging,
"Okay, was there contact?"

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,430
And if there was, how much
force of contact was there,

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,570
and did the outcome warrant a foul?

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,950
Flopping is a convenient way to identify

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,220
what people think players are doing,

18
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,950
and in some cases, certainly
players are exaggerating.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,720
And so, referees, it's
very difficult for us

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,847
to be the judge to say, "How
much contact does it take

21
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,657
"to throw a world class player

22
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,620
"off of their particular game?"

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,120
And, the reality is, sometimes
it doesn't take very much.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,920
If you look at the number
of touches per game,

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,310
the Ronaldos, the Messis,
the Neymars, you name it,

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,140
and those top players get
more touches on the ball,

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,810
and so they see more fouls,

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,260
just by the nature of the game, right?

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,520
They're participating in the game.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,960
There are some teams that
have a strategy that is

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,630
let's go out and be more
physical than the other team,

32
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,770
and so, obviously, if
one of those players,

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,800
Neymar included, happens
to be near the ball,

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,610
they're gonna be the
recipient of a higher number

35
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,460
of foul counts.

36
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,840
I think there has been
a lot of focus on him

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,500
and his abilities with the ball,

38
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,820
and so I do think teams
are looking at ways

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,530
to neutralize that, and part
of that may be simple fouls,

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,910
or even legitimate body
contact that's allowed

41
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,620
by the laws of the game.

42
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,450
And that takes its toll over time.

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,520
Certainly, when you slow things down,

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,100
tends to look a lot worse than
it may really be in reality,

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,210
but I do think that there
are players that are trying

46
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,470
to develop that as part of their craft,

47
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,900
like it's competitive as it
is just player to player,

48
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,020
and now they're looking
for a competitive edge.

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,860
And, in some case, I
think that they understand

50
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,770
that their teams may be better
with free kick situations

51
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,940
than normal run of the play,

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,850
and so they are looking for opportunities

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,040
to take free kicks. How
do ya get a free kick?

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,210
You get a foul called against you.

55
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,340
I think from a referee
community standpoint,

56
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,440
there will be some focus
after the World Cup,

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,210
more than likely on how
do we help ourselves,

58
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,580
as referees, either identify
situations that are needing

59
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,110
to be punished by a foul,

60
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,210
or identifying the
situations in which players

61
00:02:51,210 --> 00:00:00,000
are taking advantage of
the laws of the game.
