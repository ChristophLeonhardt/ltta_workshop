00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,610

through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roof suddenly everybody is</font>

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,609
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Green Power sustainability</font>

any of that anymore disappears what is

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,680
it about the United States that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it</font>

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we cannot or at least have not</font>

put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of policies in place that</font>

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,550
Europe has why is it so hard to put

<font color="#E5E5E5">these policies in place Henry we have</font>

gratification<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that put me in</font>

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,510
the energy business 35 years ago was

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,540
after the second arab oil embargo and I

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,980
saw the dislocations you know economic

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,739
dislocations lining up in block line gas

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,170
lines to fill your car on an odd or even

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,630
day what's happened and at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,480
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> importing twenty-eight percent of</font>

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,520
our energy from foreign countries and

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,040
they remember Jimmy Carter had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,200
sweater on and we were going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve</font>

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,180
energy independence it was a moral

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,750
equivalent of war unfortunately when the

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,380
price collapsed people went back to

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,700
their profligate ways and but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
country like Denmark which was there

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,560
were two countries cut off during that

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,770
embargo<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was America and Denmark and</font>

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,010
Denmark basically said never again we're

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're going to free ourselves</font>

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,540
from importing foreign energy today they

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,610
get 20 pitch over twenty percent of

38
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,000
their power from<font color="#CCCCCC"> wind by 2020 they're</font>

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,370
going to have fifty percent they've

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,229
created an industry which they're

41
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,500
exporting now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the world so I</font>

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,848
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point when we're importing</font>

43
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,129
over sixty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our energy from</font>

44
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,189
foreign countries and transferring

45
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:16,019
trillions of dollars of<font color="#CCCCCC"> America's wealth</font>

46
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,819
to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries</font>

47
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,159
that are taking these funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and turning</font>

48
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,980
it against us through terrorism through

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,760
you know the geopolitics we have got to

50
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,650
finally it's been the biggest national

51
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,969
policy failure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my lifetime not really</font>

52
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,760
standing up firmly and and attacking

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,590
this problem and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think it</font>

54
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,269
will take I I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

55
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,519
we got a price carbon we have to put a

56
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,499
price on carbon whether it be through a

57
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:52,139
cap-and-trade or whether it<font color="#CCCCCC"> be through a</font>

58
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,370
revenue-neutral carbon tax because we

59
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,439
are not calculating in the external

60
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,699
costs of carbon pollution and and I'm

61
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,949
not only talking about climate change

62
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare impacts I'm talking about</font>

63
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,209
the billions of dollars monthly that we

64
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,769
spend in in trying to keep the supply

65
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,919
lines open and sending you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> American</font>

66
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,840
men and women over to these foreign

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,120
countries that sometimes leave their

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,139
lives over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so i think what it's</font>

69
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,009
going to take it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

70
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,280
to break free from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from the</font>

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">coal and oil lobbies they have</font>

72
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,790
tremendous influence but i think that

73
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the American public is becoming ed you</font>

74
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,530
know is getting educated about these

75
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,000
issues and when I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on college campuses</font>

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,419
and I talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to young people I mean</font>

77
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,159
they're going to be the ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

78
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to inherit this environment and I</font>

79
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,229
think that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had it up to here</font>

80
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,019
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see us moving away from</font>

81
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,139
fossil fuels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

82

<font color="#E5E5E5">economic security and our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> national</font>

security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to see us move</font>

85
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,139
towards renewable energy and it's going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen</font>
