a crypto currencies have been hitting all time highs recently Bitcoin spiked at $19,000 making it the fifth most valuable currency in circulation but critics are warning that the crypto rush may be a bubble about to burst so here's what you need to know about Bitcoin bitcoin is a financial milestone are each normos for centuries is taken over the title of biggest bubble in history from what was known as tulip mania in the Netherlands bitcoins value has surged by around 60 times in the last three years that's faster than tulip bulbs in the 17th century which is one point worth 10 years were skilled craftsmen earnings back then prices were driven by greed or a fear of missing out but as more people bought into the bowels of quick profits a flurry of cells collapsed the price and left many with crippling debts bitcoin is being called the digital tulip of the 21st century as the same pattern emerges a fear of missing out and new investors piling in critics say the perceived value of the currency like the tulip is being conjured out of thin air but the ever growing army of Bitcoin believers says here to stay with an operational market in full flow round the clock and new places all over the world ready to accept the cryptocurrency as payment even a church in London is happy to accept donations of the virtual kind with the size of the Bitcoin market already surpassed in some countries economies including New Zealand's influential banks are being left behind but as history shows us boom is usually followed by bust and soon it could be bitcoins turn to welt or blossom so how concerned should people be well Union and he'll discuss the possible repercussions of a crash with a Bitcoin advocate I do not believe this is a bubble and it's just the beginning of an adoption rate of a technology how damaging could the losses be though if prices suddenly drop we have heard people people putting savings into it it affects it's so large not and affects so many different thing if the prices did suddenly drop would it be a catastrophe of course that it could be said for anything really if people are storing value in it that they can't live without a lot of the crypto enthusiasts do say only invest money you can live without and don't use any money that you're emotionally attached to so that way if it is in a volatile market and that's what cryptocurrency is right now it's extremely risky it's highly volatile and if you're emotionally attached to any value you put into it you might be up late at night biting your nails on the overall scale of things if the cryptocurrency bubble does burst and I understand there's a lot of different there things would have to go wrong for that to happen of course without of repercussions on the rest of the financial world and markets is it that big I would actually be more worried about if the bubble doesn't burst what kind of effects it could have on the world economy in general if it doesn't burst it may actually have more repercussions than if it weren't at birth today even if you wanted to sell a million dollars early he said billionaires somebody wanted to sell a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin today it's not easy so it would take a long time for that to happen and if you're an investor in crypto currencies if you do sell your crypto there's ideal ideologies behind it where you want to sell your crypto to somebody who's looking to invest in it who's going to hold it long-term that way the crypto currency you're holding and waiting to sell because you have to do it little by little it doesn't lose value drastically over time because you just dumped it on the market
