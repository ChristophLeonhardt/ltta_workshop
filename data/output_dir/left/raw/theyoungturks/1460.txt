1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,870
A 64-YEAR-OLD ALBANIAN MAN
WHO BECAME A U.S. CITIZEN BACK

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,870
IN

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,600
2010 WAS TRAVELING BACK TO
ALBANIA WITH CASH.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,060
THERE IS A

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,930
LOT OF CORRUPTION AND FRAUD
WITHIN THE ALBANIAN BAKING

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,340
SYSTEM AND THE CURRENCY RATES,
EXCHANGE RATES ARE HIGH SO HE

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,810
DECIDED TO TRAVEL BACK WITH CASH
AND HE WAS PLANNING ON HELPING

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,140
FAMILY THERE.

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,810
WHILE HE WAS
TRAVELING WITH THE MONEY IN HIS

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,779
CARRY-ON LUGGAGE, TSA FLAGGED
HIS LUGGAGE AND FOUND THE MONEY.

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:34,120
HE HAD A PRETTY LARGE AMOUNTS
OF CASH, $58,000 IN CASH IN ALL

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,210
$100 BILLS.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,120
HE ALSO HAD THE
BANKING WITHDRAWAL RECEIPTS TO

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,239
PROVE THAT THAT CASH DID NOT
COME FROM ANYTHING ILLEGAL OR

15
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,540
DRUG TRAFFICKING BUT IT DID NOT
MATTER.

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:01:00,040
THEY HAVE 
YET TO CHARGE HIM

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,890
WITH ANY CRIME AND THIS IS

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,920
EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING PEOPLE
IN AMERICA GO THROUGH WHEN

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,710
AUTHORITIES PRACTICE SOMETHING
KNOWN AS CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE.

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,180
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE PROVEN
GUILTY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,380
CHARGED WITH A CRIME.

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,390
IF YOU
ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PROPERTY

23
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,979
OR CASH THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN ANYTHING ILLEGAL,

24
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,869
THEY CAN TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU
AS PART OF THEIR INVESTIGATION

25
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,270
AND IT IS VERY UNLIKELY YOU WILL
GET THE MONEY BACK.

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,270
IN FACT, IF

27
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,370
YOU DO, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS VERY

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,930
DIFFICULT SYSTEM TO PROVE
THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,890
YOU ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN
INNOCENT AND THAT IS WHAT

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,890
HAPPENED TO THIS MANTRA.

31
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,870
HE HAS TO PROVE THAT HE IS
INNOCENT OF NOTHING BECAUSE

32
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,420
THERE WAS NOT EVEN A CRIME.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,549
HE WASN'T CHARGED WITH
ANYTHING.

34
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,610
HE DIDN'T EVEN DO THE ONE
THING THAT THEY USUALLY USE AS A

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,450
TECHNICALITY WHICH IS YOU HAVE
TO DECLARE THE GUILT AND

36
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,719
THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH YOU.

37
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,990
HE
HAD A LAYOVER IN NEWARK BEFORE

38
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,479
HE LEFT THE COUNTRY, THAT IS
WHEN HE WOULD'VE HAD TO DECLARE

39
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,219
SO THEY DIDN'T EVEN LET HIM FILL
OUT THE FORM AND THEY SAID, HE

40
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,670
WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO CONCEAL
THE MONEY.

41
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,670
NO, HE LITERALLY

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,699
LAID OUT IN HIS BACK VERY
CLEARLY IN FACT WITHIN THERE AND

43
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,240
LABELED THEM.

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,060
HE DIDN'T CONCEAL
IT AT ALL.

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,250
THEN AFTER THEY GET

46
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,590
THIS NOTICING HEY, CAN YOU GIVE
US THE MONEY BACK THEY SAY NO,

47
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,390
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS
INVOLVED IN SMUGGLING OR

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,730
DRUG TRAFFICKING OR MONEY
LAUNDERING.

49
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,510
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.

50
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,550
AND THEN THE FAMILY WAS LIKE,
WHICH ONE?

51
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,730
LITERALLY.

52
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,980
YOU JUST LISTED A BUNCH OF
OPTIONS, DO YOU HAVE

53
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
EVIDENCE OF ANY OF THOSE THINGS?

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,879
NO, AND THEN BY THE WAY, THIS
FAMILY FOLLOWED EVERY SINGLE

55
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,080
PROCEDURE AND LAW THAT YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO GET THE MONEY

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,629
BACK SO BY LAW, THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO RETURN THE

57
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,030
MONEY AFTER A 90 DAY PERIOD AND
THEY WERE LIKE NO, WE'RE

58
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,790
JUST NOT GOING TO.

59
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,239
THE GUY
WAS WORRIED ABOUT THEIVES IN

60
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,650
ALBANIA, PARTLY WHEN HE WAS
WITHDRAWING THE BANK, THEY

61
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,760
WAIT FOR YOU AND THERE'S A
LOT OF CRIME THERE.

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,420
WHEN HE DIDN'T KNOW IS IN
AMERICA THE GOVERNMENT IS THE

63
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,740
CRIMINALS AND SO WHEN YOU GO TO
THE AIRPORT, BEFORE YOU GET

64
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,030
TO DEPOSIT IN ANY BANK IN
ALBANIA, WE ARE GOING TO

65
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,629
ROB YOU OF YOUR MONEY.

66
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,739
SPEAKING OF THIEVES, THE
NUMBER THAT THEY DECLARED IS

67
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,850
ABOUT $700 SHORT THAN WHAT HE
TOOK WITH HIM.

68
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,850
EVEN IF HE GOES

69
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,739
THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND SPEND
ALL THIS MONEY TO GET HIS MONEY

70
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,590
BACK, IT IS GOING TO BE $700
SHORT.

71
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,010
CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE IS
SUCH A BIG ISSUE.

72
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,010
IN 2017

73
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,280
ALONE, THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES
SEIZED $2 BILLION.

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
THAT IS

75
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,230
SIMILAR TO THE AMOUNT THAT
BURGLARIZED RESIDENCIES HAVE

76
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,209
AMOUNTED TO, BUT THE OTHER THING
WHICH MAKES ME REALLY SUSPECT OF

77
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,569
THE AUTHORITIES IS THAT THEY
GAVE HIM OPTIONS AND ONE OF THE

78
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,989
OPTIONS WAS THERE IS A
COMPROMISE OFFER.

79
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:55,040
IF YOU SAY

80
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,480
THAT YOU WILL GET LESS MONEY
THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU SOME OF

81
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,060
THE MONEY BACK SO THAT ACTUALLY
MEANS THAT HE DID NOT DO

82
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
ANYTHING.

83
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,170
IT IS A SOURCE OF REVENUE NOW
FOR THE FEDS AND FOR STATE

84
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,879
POLICE AND CITY POLICE OFFICERS.

85
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:20,779
THIS IS BIG GOVERNMENT 
AND IT

86
00:04:20,779 --> 00:00:00,000
IS ROBBERY.
