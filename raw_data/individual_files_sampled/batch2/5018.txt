today the White House said that it was considering a request made by the Russian government to hand over to Russia for questioning America's former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul White House and this president have done a lot to shock people over the last 72 hours this is kind of add another level the great national security reporter spencer ackerman rounded up response tonight from even some serving US officials quote current and former American diplomats are expressing disgust and horror over the White House's willingness to entertain permitting Russian officials to question a prominent former US ambassador one serving diplomat serving so currently in the in the government when serving diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was quote at an effing loss and he didn't say effing quote it's beyond disgraceful it's fundamentally ignorant with regard to how we conduct diplomacy or what that means quote by failing to reject the idea out of hand immediately and forcefully Trump signal but absolutely nothing is off limits when it comes to Putin again this is a currently-serving US official saying about this this this threat basically that the White House is now making that they might hand over Mike McFaul to Russia saying quote the president has first and foremost his interests his interests at the top of his mind as opposed to the government's that is very clear over the plan over the past week and a half between bleeping word that starts with sh bleeping on our NATO allies and kissing Putin's butt but he didn't say but this is a serving US diplomat quote he cares more about himself than the nation and any of us who serve it the diplomat continued quote either he's compromised by Putin or he's a word that starts with P in which case he should grab himself this is a serving US official a current US official who just said that tonight and there's more from America's former ambassador to Afghanistan who's now president of the American Academy of diplomacy quote if the US would make a former diplomat available for questioning by a foreign government without evidence of wrongdoing that would be quite horrifying Susan Rice former national security adviser former US ambassador to the UN calls it quote beyond outrageous if the White House cannot defend and protect our diplomats like our servicemembers they are serving a hostile foreign power and not the American people former chief of staff at the State Department says that the White House refusing to disavow Putin on McFaul refusing to stand up to Putin on McCraw crosses a line for American diplomats quote from demoralizing to dangerous I mean literally what the White House said today in response to a question about this Russian demand that the u.s. government hand Michael McFaul over to Putin what the White House said in response to that was quote the president is gonna meet with his team and we'll let you know when we have an announcement on that oh yeah see their talk they're talking it over presidents meet with this team because they need to do some thinking some cogitating they need to do a little chat chat over whether or not we're gonna hand over an American ambassador to Putin so Putin can do whatever he wants to might do it got to talk about it Putin asked so it's not like we'll just say no right this is unbelievable to the extent that this seems like a sort of marginal new development in a worrying week this is not that this is a qualitatively different thing right we have these abstract ideas and ideals about patriotism and not betraying your country right we have a sort of ominous but maybe vague worry about what it might mean for us as individual American citizens if there's somebody in power in our government who's subordinate to a hostile foreign government all right it's it all sounds very ominous it sounds very bad but what's the real concrete nuts-and-bolts threat to anyone of us what could that really mean in our daily lives well it could mean that people you know Americans you know are handed over to foreign dictators when those dictators ask not because that American has done anything wrong not because there's any real allegations against him or her but because that foreign dictator doesn't like that American wants him or her eliminated and that dictator holds sway over somebody in power in this country who he can order to do what he wants and so an American gets handed over and that's what it could mean I mean yes this this president could be trying to dissolve NATO he could be trying to tear apart the European Union and all of America's most important international alliances yes he can continue to do his best to attack and weaken American law enforcement and American intelligence so among other things Russia can keep running whatever operations they want to keep running over here we've been watching all these things that Russia wants that this president has been working diligently to get done but another one of the things he could start doing is handing over to Putin Americans who Putin wants dead president the White House says as of today the president is meeting with his team about that talking it over thinking about it we will have the man in question ambassador Michael McFaul here to respond in just a moment tonight hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you
