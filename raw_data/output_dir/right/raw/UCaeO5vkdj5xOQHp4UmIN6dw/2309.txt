say them Democrats believe that ideas

<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so Trump in Mexico this is</font>

127
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,319
actually a big store I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

128
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,180
mean there there is a poll today from

129
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fox that has Trump and Hillary two</font>

130
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:42,910
points ahead as Hillary only two points

131
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,069
ahead of Trump with that means that the

132
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:47,050
gap has really narrowed a lot of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

133
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,330
points earlier in the month and i think

134
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,190
the stuff that happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday is</font>

135

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really going to be but you know i</font>

137
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,340
think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is a game-saver I think</font>

00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,979
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a game saver game changer and</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in the most presidential moment</font>

159
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,500
but at least he stood<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for our Second</font>

160
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,479
Amendment rights right now and then

161
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,729
later he came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in a press conference</font>

162
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,250
with Nieto and he made conciliatory

163

remarks about mexican-americans Mexican

183
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:26,810
things he said about the rapists and all

184
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,979
as far as I'm concerned we can end the

185
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,050
show right here but precious books<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

186

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,430
really happened and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really do believe</font>

188
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,020
I really do believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going</font>

189
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a big effect on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> polls if if</font>

190
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,449
the valium doesn't wear off and Trump

191
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,039
like blows his foot off with like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

192
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,110
cannon or something like this but just

193
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,629
yesterday he<font color="#E5E5E5"> really looked great he goes</font>

194
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">down there and he meets with the</font>

195
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,279
president at the present the Mexican

196
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">president's request and then he comes</font>

197
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,569
out he gives one of these joint press

198
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,339
conferences and for those of you who are

199
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,960
supporters of Hillary Clinton<font color="#CCCCCC"> at press</font>

200
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
conferences<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a can that it stands</font>

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,259
in front of the press and answers

202
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,300
questions so this was it's a little

203
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,699
different on our side than on yours but

204
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">he gets at me gives a press conference</font>

205
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he was actually really first of all</font>

206
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,599
he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very restrained he really did</font>

207
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,000
look like valium it looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it was</font>

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">dead but he stood up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his thing about</font>

209
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,319
the wall he stuck to his guns about the

210
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,909
walls what we have that having a secure

211
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:26,169
border is a sovereign right

212
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,919
and mutually beneficial we recognize and

213
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,339
respect the right of either country to

214
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,299
build a physical barrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> or wall on any</font>

215
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,179
of its borders to stop the illegal

216
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,519
movement of people drugs and weapons

217
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,970
cooperation toward achieving this shared

218
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,490
objective and it will be shared of

219
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,920
safety for all citizens is paramount to

220
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,199
both the United States and to Mexico so

221
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,209
and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little bit conciliatory</font>

222
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,920
about NAFTA<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trade agreement he's</font>

223
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,990
said again<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is a disaster in</font>

224
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,850
Mexico stealing all our jobs which is

225
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,410
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous on the face of it</font>

226
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,639
because it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that we want to be</font>

227
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,440
more like Mexico and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

228
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sneak into their country which</font>

229
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,589
doesn't it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make any sense</font>

230
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:17,139
but he said openly and in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

231
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,529
president yet oh he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he felt</font>

232
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,149
that NAFTA had been better from Mexico

233
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:24,430
than for the US and yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh said look</font>

234
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">this room to modernize ID I think was</font>

235
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,269
the word he used so you know if he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

236
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> very you know I hate to use the</font>

237
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,110
word but he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was very presidential he was</font>

238
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,149
the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> who called on the questions from</font>

239
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the press which is actually not the way</font>

240
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,660
it usually works usually the guy from

241
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,730
his home country it's his home court he

242
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,040
calls on the reporters but Trump was

243
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,570
just he was just in charge he looked

244
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,070
like he looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything his</font>

245
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,920
supporters say he is and you know I've

246
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,810
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very honest about my you know</font>

247
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,640
feelings about Trump I have a real

248
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,170
problems with<font color="#CCCCCC"> him but I'm just telling</font>

249
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,019
it the way I saw it like it looked to me

250
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,130
looking at that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean look at this</font>

251
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,230
picture of him shaking hands we have a

252
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,269
picture from shaking hands with the

253
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,980
president right there's two guys who

254
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,149
looked like they're just on equal

255
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:05,949
footing right this is that that's the

256
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:07,269
way an American president should look

257
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:08,459
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not looking down on him he's not</font>

258
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,480
bullying him he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just shaking hands</font>

259
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">llam compare that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hillary Clinton</font>

260
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,660
when she<font color="#E5E5E5"> should bow the famous Obama bow</font>

261
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,199
because Obama is even worse does

262
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,240
everything but like but press his

263
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,010
forehead to the ground like he's in a

264
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,649
mosque so I mean it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know it</font>

265
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,779
is refreshing I'm sorry but it is

266
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,269
refreshing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see somebody acting like a</font>

267
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,240
leader<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a country and not like a that</font>

268
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,010
we have to go and apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people</font>

269
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,890
for supporting most of the free nations

270
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,520
of the

271
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,260
and of course we know that he did well

272
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,570
because the left-wing press went nuts

273
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,920
I'll get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the New York Times a</font>

274
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,840
New York hunter went insane they went

275
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of their minds but all of them they</font>

276
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,280
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead with the fact Trump came</font>

277
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,260
out and said we didn't discuss who would

278
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,880
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the wall that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a big Trump</font>

279
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,140
thing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexico is going to pay for</font>

280
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wall and then yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tow came out and</font>

281
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,500
said well the first thing out of my

282
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,570
mouth when we sat down to talk was that

283
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,310
there's no way we're paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

284
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,680
wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they said oh there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

285
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,390
conflict one person said it was one way

286
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,460
when but all Trump's head was the hidden

287
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,680
discuss it and he didn't respond I mean

288
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">even the Mexican spokesman said no we</font>

289
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,310
didn't discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> it he didn't respond so</font>

290
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,140
that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comment that yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tomei</font>

291
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,880
so it really the whole thing went off

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,030
well Hillary attacked him before he even

293
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,400
left I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> before I even got back from</font>

294
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the meeting she was at the the American</font>

295
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,750
Legion where she gave a speech<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

296
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,530
so irritating in its pro-american you

297
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,500
know tone when all she has ever done<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

298
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,450
whole careers like dis the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font>

299
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,010
anyway then she said this about Trump

300
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,160
you don't build a coalition by insulting

301
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,190
our friends or acting like a loose

302
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,170
cannon you do it by putting in the slow

303
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,610
hard work of<font color="#E5E5E5"> building relationships</font>

304
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,920
getting countries working together was

305
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,530
my job every day as your Secretary of

306
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,730
State it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a photo op it takes</font>

307
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,630
consistency and reliability actually

308
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,370
it's just like building personal

309
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,240
relationships people have to get to know

310
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,790
that they can count<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

311
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,800
won't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing one day and</font>

312
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,120
something totally different the next and

313
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,670
it certainly takes more than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,010
make up for a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> of insults and</font>

315
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,920
insinuations by<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping in on our</font>

316
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,890
neighbors for a few hours and then

317
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,380
flying home again that is not how it

318
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,230
works so we have the spectacle of

319
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,810
Hillary Clinton talking about trust that

320
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,760
you know she's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to she's not</font>

321
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,950
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say one thing you know one day</font>

322
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next she's</font>

323
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,580
going to stick to her lies right down

324
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the road</font>

325
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,290
and secondly she looks like death I mean

326
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,640
she looks like she didn't even wash her

327
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,290
hair<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the feeling like I</font>

328
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,270

331
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,650

332
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,330
comment on her appearance people say

333
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,700
it's sexist as if I've never made jokes

334
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,860
about the fact that Donald Trump looks

335
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,360
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a walking cheese puffs you know I</font>

336
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,550
mean I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly fair the</font>

337
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,040
woman looks terrible you know somebody

342
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,870
Trump goes to Phoenix and then he makes

343
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,050
his speech that he has been putting off

344
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,910
where he's going to outline his

345
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,070
immigration proposals is he<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soften</font>

351
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,580
had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change it later it started out</font>

352
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,710
Donald J Trump made an audacious attempt

353
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,480
on Wednesday to remake his image on the

354
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,940
divisive issue of immigration shelving

355
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,620
his plan to deport 11 million

356
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,840
undocumented people and suggesting that

357
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,790
the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Mexico would solve</font>

358
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the immigration crisis together well</font>

359
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,900
Twitter went nuts<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know that's</font>

360
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what people saw it reminded me when</font>

361
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,010
I was a reporter there was a I think was

362
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,500
a July fourth picnic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reporter</font>

363
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,090
decided what's going to happen in July

364
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,950
fourth picnic that county supervisor is

365
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,360
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up and give us patriotic</font>

366
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,060
speech so he didn't go any file the

367
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,520
story anyway and the supervisor<font color="#E5E5E5"> got up</font>

368
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,550
and had a heart attack the paper ran his

369
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,690
story saying you know here was the

370
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,360
speech by the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> soup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> County Supervisor</font>

371
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,160
the July fourth speech but the true

372
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,480
story was the speech by the county

373
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,590
supervisor was boom that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sweet in</font>

374
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,420
it and this was what this was like it

375
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,920
was like they filed it so it doesn't

376
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point is it doesn't matter</font>

377
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,090
they rewrote the story then to say that

378
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,430
well Donald Trump did try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sound hard</font>

379
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,960
line but he wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything</font>

380
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,570
more hardline than a Barack Obama has

381
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,460
done Barack Obama's according to the new

382
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,080

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,930
line and effective on immigration none
