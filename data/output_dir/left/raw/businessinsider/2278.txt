00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,770
quite recently you had an incredibly

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,320
famous and powerful cover saying the web

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,090
is dead what brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to powers we</font>

did<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all I have to I have to say</font>

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,269
I'm a magazine editor and magazine

<font color="#E5E5E5">the web is not dead I think the word</font>

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,350
dead is hyperbolic by any definition

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,449
what I believe is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rise of the</font>

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,359
the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so the full title by</font>

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way is to be clear the web is dead</font>

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,570
long live the internet so we're making a

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,700
quite subtle distinction Clinton clearly

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,770
not subtle on the cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know</font>

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,230
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you learned in your 18 months of</font>

of said put in cover<font color="#CCCCCC"> site let's make it</font>

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,879
relatively nuanced argument about what

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,469
changes as the way as the internet goes

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,000
mobile what you see of course is the

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,219
rise of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the app economy as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

looked at the sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

mobile devices the living room devices

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,010
the apps what we saw is there always an

29
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,539
internet for transport but not

30
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,280
