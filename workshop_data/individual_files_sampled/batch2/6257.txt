it costs a lot of money to detain migrant children we are just discovering that in this new policy that the Trump administration created and inso created a pretty costly problem for themselves it costs 266 million dollars more than was allocated so they needed to find it somewhere and they're taking it from some pretty terrible places to be taking money from so they're taking 80 million dollars from the other refugee areas that they had it allotted to because they're not taking in as many refugees so that's 80 million dollars they say by turning people who are fleeing domestic violence and gang activity they're turning them away at the border that's saving them money but here are the other places that they're taking money from in order to pay for building tents to house these kids that they are have they have collected it includes sixteen point seven million dollars from headstart five point seven million dollars from the Ryan White hiv/aids program and thirteen point three million dollars from the National Cancer Institute money is also being diverted from programs dedicated to mental and maternal health women's shelters and substance abuse well done hmm the people who don't matter to those people yeah the people of color cuz headstart is for those programs are for people who have are from lower-income families people who are ill and you know it's just a group of people that they don't care about and I'm really upset because I just got a rejection letter from one of the those migrant detention centers because I wanted to volunteer with the children and they told me that I didn't qualify did they give any more explanation as I'll show you the letter they sent me this long letter telling me that I did it and I know people who did not even get screened that went and volunteered with the children mm-hmm and they they actually just walked in oh so three things stand out to me here one is we're gonna take from educating your kids and we're gonna put it into imprisoning kits okay so that's pretty stark secondly you know they talk about so some of this stuff that his voters would be happy with I get that you know Brett talked about refugees running from violence but you know they're also running from Isis some of the refugees but but if you ask the guys who voted for Trump they probably don't mind that too much like I didn't want refugees take money from there I don't care who they're running from I just don't want them here right so they they they're probably on board for that but some of the other issues like taking away from mental health funding I thought whatever there was a shooting you guys would say it's not the guns it's mental health that's the problem but now you're defunding mental health and then substance abuse I thought you said you were gonna solve the opioid problem I mean of course Trump and his usual crazy over-the-top statement said he was just gonna solve it it was going to be gone we weren't gonna have an opioid problem anymore but now here he is taking money away from fixing problems like that to imprison more kids and they're being held it's like it's this horrible ultimatum because they're saying if Congress doesn't approve this and I would just love to see Congress being like where do you plan to pay for these kids that you're imprisoning and holding in detention centers you know 12,000 more than you had last year at this time like where do you plan to put them and how do you plan to pay for it and then the administration saying just have the kid and then it don't okay don't you even think about it cancer can we just have we just take money from cancer and pay for it and they were just like okay fine and like the fact that that's like okay fine and I was just going to say you know the fact that they're holding Congress sort of with this hostage with this ultimatum saying if you don't give us these funds then we are going to feed them plastic boxes and let them sleep on nails that's basically what they're saying that we're going to deprive them even more and less well like the cancer is particularly from like a thematic approach it is a particularly ironic thing to take money from because cancer is a problem that it takes money and resources to solve the solution to this problem just takes not having this policy like that's it what they have done in addition to the original policy that everyone knows about is they've also changed the means by which people can come and say I'm a sponsor of this child I know you separated the family and I know that you're just holding them indefinitely but they change the policy so they're fingerprinting everyone that comes to claim that they have a relationship with the kid and that's scaring people away from taking this child off of the premises and even if they're a family member or whatnot and even those who are family members and are documenting correctly are afraid because also the administration has been imprisoning people or taking away visas from people who already have visas and those visas are genuine it's it's not fair and they could solve the problem so quickly and they choose not to and said they'd rather take money from the Ryan White AIDS Foundation which Ryan way is a kid who died from AIDS and they set up this foundation and they're just taking money from it so let me build on what Brent was saying and then give you guys some numbers in May of 2017 so Trump is now in office and is beginning these programs there was 2,400 kids in federal custody that were immigrant kids 2,400 now there are thirteen thousand three hundred and twelve so this is unprecedented these are not normal times so that we don't normally have oh we normally you have 11 or 12,000 and Trump's got 13s no we're at 2,400 now we have 13,000 and why is that it's four because of two reasons one they separated some of the kids from their parents as we all know and and they lost some of the parents the kids we have but they deported some of the parents and they don't know where they are so I don't know what we're ever gonna do with those kids but they remain in detention centers it's like if you pitched that movie it'd be like The Hunger Games Meets The Handmaid's Tale like yeah this is what makes me always call into question all of the women who voted for Donald Trump the programs that are being cut are directly targeting women and children so I though all of those women who felt justified in voting for Donald Trump and putting him into office and this administration has correctly attacked women in so many levels that's why they're trying to get this guy approved for the Supreme Court because they're coming for us they're gunning for us I just want to know where these women are now that really really felt justified in putting this this man in office like this this is this is disgusting and let's not talk about these centers all this money that's going into them and you still got babies dying from getting sick from being in these centers like these are human beings that we're talking about that there's you know there's like border patrol officers and people in the Senate you know centers who are abusing who there's a guy who's like a serial killers just you know a border patrol where's the outrage there but that's okay you know some of these women to your point I does you know not all the women are you know have a sense of duty to others who knows there some of them like some some of the women are the aunt Lydia's you know and and all too happy to continue this policy which is violent and horrific to women and children ya know let's also be mindful that Donald Trump's approval rating is 36% so some of those women have left the building and and partly because they didn't know and you could say look how could you not know you saw the Access Hollywood tapes you know what the Republicans have been in favor of for decades and things but there are really low information voters most people will never find out about this news story I mean we're covering it here but cable news it's nonstop to tweet this and the tweet that and there goes irrelevant and we cover those two but you should also cover these stories what percentage of Trump female voters are gonna know they took money away from cancer patients and aids and and women's shelters etc to give it to detain more kids my guess is very few percentage of them are going to know that and and they should because this is what they're doing in your name when this is comic book evil character I mean if you put it in a movie it's a that's over the top absolutely really you're gonna have the bad guy take money away from cancer and Ryan White aids and mental health and women and all of this to imprison kids come on that's way too over the top these have always been his hit list you know he has never shown respect to people with disabilities people you know who have you know drug dependency people who have like our veterans people who have immigrants people of color to women I mean people who are sick and not the hardiest I mean it kind of he knocked all of them out the box I just wanted the people who support him and the women who still support him can you tweet me what your deal-breaker is what's the cutoff for you at what point do you say oh no I can't support this any much that every reasonable person be like we can't take it from me it's can take you from cancer can't take it from women like women's maternal health they're taking in Tornillo alone in one facility they had 400 beds this money is going to create 3,400 more events in a tent yeah in a prison tent which by the way is super expensive and costs all of us taxpayers a lot of money too if you're conservative you should care about that but I like the project Ida just started okay a hashtag bottom barrel okay or barrel bottom let's go with barrel bottom because we're trying to find the bottom of the barrel what
