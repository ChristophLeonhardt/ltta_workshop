1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,200
Our experience with the automobile is

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,000
as mass-produced object.

3
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:07,925
Identical machines, endlessly replicated.

4
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,900
But some cars are different.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,035
Some cars are built

6
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:16,920
in small numbers.

7
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:19,705
Not thousands, but dozens.

8
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,065
Or even just one.

9
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,025
 

10
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:36,200
These objects are more than cars, they are  artifacts.

11
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:37,295
And the people who make them,

12
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,295
artisans.

13
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:50,755
 

14
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:51,995
 

15
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:54,495
 

16
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:57,345
 

17
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:03,745
Horacio Pagani builds what are called Hypercars:

18
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:07,135
200-mile-per-hour sports machines

19
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:09,460
that cost millions and look like they belong in an art gallery.

20
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,945
 

21
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:17,185
 

22
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:20,015
 

23
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,065
 

24
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:24,065
 

25
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:27,485
 

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,480
 

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,740
Yet, in a technical milieu,

28
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,445
requiring aerospace precision, Sig. Pagani

29
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,465
prefers pencils over CAD drawings,

30
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,855
people over robots. I wanted to know why.

31
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:54,495
I want you to imagine two objects.

32
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:56,205
Why is the handmade object

33
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,975
more valuable than the machine-made?

34
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:00,615
 

35
00:02:01,645 --> 00:00:00,000
