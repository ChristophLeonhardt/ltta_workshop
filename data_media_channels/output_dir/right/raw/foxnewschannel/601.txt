1
00:00:00,611 --> 00:00:00,910
THAT.

2
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:04,314
WE SHOULD GET THAT ON THE SHOW.

3
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:07,150
KEEP SENDING US YOUR THOUGHTS,

4
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:07,684
FRIENDS@FOXNEWS.COM.

5
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:09,118
THE FIRST REAL FAIR I EVER WENT

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,421
TO WAS WITH GOVERNOR MIKE

7
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:11,788
HUCKABEE.

8
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,357
WE WANT TO BRING HIM IN NOW --

9
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:16,125
PETE: I THINK HE REMEMBERS THIS.

10
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:17,393
ABBY: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

11
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:18,962
REMEMBER THIS, BUT YOU WERE IN

12
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:19,929
CHARGE OF THE GOVERNORS'

13
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,697
ASSOCIATION, AND IT WAS THE

14
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:22,398
FIRST TIME I MET YOU AND YOUR

15
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:22,732
FAMILY.

16
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:23,800
I BELIEVE IT WAS IN ARKANSAS,

17
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,905
>> YES, I DO, ABBY.

18
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:29,272
[LAUGHTER]

19
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:30,874
AND I REMEMBER THAT YOUR DAD AND

20
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,310
I IN IOWA PLAYED WITH R EXO

21
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:35,445
SPEEDWAGON, BECAUSE YOUR DAD IS

22
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,447
AN AMAZING KEYBOARD MARE, AND

23
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:39,983
I'M A MEDIOCRE BASS PLAYER.

24
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:41,851
I REMEMBER, THE BEST STATE FOOD

25
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:44,320
FAIR IS PORK CHOP ON A STICK AT

26
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:45,622
THE IOWA STATE FAIR.

27
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:46,823
NORMALLY YOU GO TO THESE THINGS

28
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:48,825
AND YOU JUST TAKE A BITE FOR THE

29
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,226
CAMERAS AND YOU KIND OF PASS IT

30
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:52,228
ON, AND THAT'S IT, ONE BITE.

31
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,963
I TOOK ONE BITE OF THAT, IT WAS

32
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:55,365
SO GOOD, AND THEY STARTED TO

33
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,799
TAKE IT AWAY THERE ME.

34
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,635
I SAY TOUCH ME AND I KILL YOU.

35
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:02,639
GRIFF: IT IS REALLY GOOD.

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,374
I CAN ATTEST TO THAT.

37
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,475
THE GOVERNOR IS TELLING THE

38
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:05,775
TRUTH.

39
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,443
AND PEOPLE LINE UP JUST TO GET

40
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:09,112
THAT IOWA STATE FAIR PORK CHOP.

41
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:10,780
IT IS A SERIOUS THING.

42
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,282
ABBY: AND PEOPLE ALSO LINE UP,

43
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:13,683
GOVERNOR, FOR THESE BIG RALLIES

44
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:15,418
THAT WE ARE SEEING THE PRESIDENT

45
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:15,685
DO.

46
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,387
HE IS REALLY GETTING THE GEAR,

47
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:19,255
GETTING US ALL IN GEAR FOR THE

48
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:19,622
MIDTERMS.

49
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:22,225
HE WAS IN TAMPA EARLIER, IN

50
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,259
PENNSYLVANIA, LAST NIGHT IN

51
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,694
OHIO, AND HE REALLY A TAKES THE

52
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:26,663
TIME, GOVERNOR, TO REMIND HIS

53
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,564
BASE WHY THEY VOTED FOR HIM, WHY

54
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:30,633
HE IS THE PERSON THAT IS

55
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:31,634
FIGHTING FOR THE THINGS THAT

56
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,169
THEY CARE MOST ABOUT, AND THAT

57
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,903
IS THIS COUNTRY.

58
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:35,605
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT PREDICTING

59
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:36,606
A RED WAVE.

60
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,308
HE SAID WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT A

61
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:39,342
BLUE WAVE COMING, AND THIS IS

62
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:41,144
WHY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A

63
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,312
RED WAVE.

64
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:43,746
HERE'S A BIT OF WHAT HE SAID

65
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:44,414
LAST NIGHT.

66
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:46,349
OH, I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

67
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,784
BUT YOU WERE WATCHING, WE WERE

68
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:49,118
ALL WATCHING IT, GOVERNOR.

69
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,386
WHAT WERE THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR

70
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:50,653
YOU?

71
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:51,955
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT DONALD

72
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:53,489
TRUMP IS DOING -- AND HE'S DOING

73
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,364
INCREASES, IF YOU WANT TO GO

74
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,932
BACK TO AN ECONOMY THAT NO

75
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,201
LONGER IS CHUGGING ALONG WITH

76
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:07,637
4.1% GDP GROWTH AND GO BACK TO

77
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:09,739
AN ANEMIC, JUST STRUGGLING

78
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,907
ECONOMY, VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

79
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,408
IF YOU WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT

80
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,210
MOVES US MORE TOWARDS SOCIALISM,

81
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,712
MORE TOWARD THE IDEA OF YOU

82
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:17,380
WORKING HARD AND GIVING IT TO

83
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:18,581
SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T WORK AS HARD

84
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:20,249
AS YOU DO, VOTE FOR THE

85
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,717
DEMOCRATS.

86
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:21,684
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

87
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:22,151
LOOKING AT.

88
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:24,320
IF YOU WANT A NATION AND A WORLD

89
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,922
THAT'S NOT AS SAFE, THAT HATES

90
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,357
COPS, THAT WANTS TO SURRENDER

91
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,292
AND BOW DOWN TO FOREIGN LEADERS,

92
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,927
VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

93
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:31,627
AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANYTHING

94
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,496
THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD DO MORE

95
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:34,464
EFFECTIVELY THAN WHAT HE'S

96
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:35,898
DOIING AND THAT'S GOING OUT

97
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:36,199
THERE.

98
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,901
AND IT DRIVES THE MEDIA PEOPLE

99
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:41,804
NUTS, IT DRIVES THE ELITISTS

100
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:46,309
BUT IT'S RALLYING THE PEOPLE AND

101
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,277
REMINDING THEM WHY HE WON

102
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:49,846
OVERWHELMINGLY IN NOVEMBER OF

103
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:50,380
2016.

104
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:51,547
GRIFF: AND, GOVERNOR, THE

105
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,682
PRESIDENT'S OUT THERE RALLY

106
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:56,386
ARING FOR, ALSO, TROY BALDERSON,

107
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:57,720
DO YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S GOING TO

108
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,755
HAVE AN IMPACT THERE?

109
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:06,629
ENDORSEMENT BECAUSE IT CALLS

110
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,996
ATTENTION.

111
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,334
SOMEBODY, BUT MAYBE A PERSON

112
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:12,935
THAT JUST WASN'T ON THE RADAR OF

113
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,940
PERSON, MAYBE I SHOULD BE TOO.

114
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:19,442
AND WE'VE SEEN THE INFLUENCE IN

115
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:20,710
KEY RACES.

116
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,546
MARTHA ROBY IN ALABAMA COMES TO

117
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,547
MIND, THERE ARE SOME OTHER RACES

118
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,549
WHERE I THINK HE'S PLAYED A

119
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,950
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN BOOSTING THE

120
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,218
CANDIDATE AND GIVING THEM THE

121
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,354
PUSH OVER THE FINISH LINE.

122
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:32,922
PETE: ABSOLUTELY.

123
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:34,357
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THE

124
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:35,358
PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT LAST NIGHT

125
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,493
WAS THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, AND

126
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:38,761
PART OF THE REASON HE TALKS

127
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,596
ABOUT IT IS THEY FAIL TO TELL

128
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,331
THE WHOLE STORY, OR THEY TELL

129
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:43,733
ONE SIDE OF THE STORY AND

130
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:45,168
PRETEND IT'S UNBIASED.

131
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,869
ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS "THE NEW

132
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,870
YORK TIMES," WHICH THE PRESIDENT

133
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:49,439
CALLS THE FAILING NEW YORK

134
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,739
TIMES.

135
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,374
THERE WAS AN OP-ED THAT CAUGHT

136
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,842
OUR EYE, IT TALKED ABOUT THE

137
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:54,577
CHILDREN AT TRUMP RALLIES.

138
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,479
IT SAID WHAT IS IT LIKE TO SEE

139
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,381
YOUNG PEOPLE EXPOSED TO SO MUCH

140
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:01,384
PHOTOGRAPHER.

141
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:02,952
SO THESE POSITING THAT THESE

142
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:04,654
KIDS AT THE RALLY THAT GO WITH

143
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:06,355
THEIR PARENTS, THEY'RE BEING --

144
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,757
THEY'RE IN A BAD SPOT.

145
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:09,892
YOU'VE HAD KIDS GO TO PLENTY OF

146
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:10,226
RALLIES.

147
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:12,128
WHAT DOES IT DO -- HOW DOES IT

148
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,196
AFFECT KIDS?

149
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:15,898
>> DONALD TRUMP RALLIES ARE

150
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,133
INCREDIBLY PATRIOTIC, THEY'RE

151
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:17,834
UPLIFT ARING.

152
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:22,137
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO AN

153
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:22,839
ARKANSAS/LSU GAME?

154
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,273
YOU WANT TO SEE SOME TENSION,

155
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:25,675
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP

156
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:26,943
YOUR KIDS AWAY FROM, THAT OUGHT

157
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:27,810
TO DO IT.

158
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:30,813
WHY DON'T WE TAKE OUR KIDS TO

159
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,217
THAT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT

160
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:35,718
PUTS YOU IN A SOOTHING MOOD.

161
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,588
I MEAN, GOOD HENS.

162
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:40,356
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" -- GOOD

163
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,324
HEAVENS, THE NEW YORK TIME THE

164
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:42,358
IS EMBARRASSING ITSELF.

165
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,960
THEY JUST HIRED A COP-HATING

166
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,728
PERSON TO BE ON THEIR EDITORIAL

167
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,330
BOARD, AND THEY EVEN HAVE THE

168
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:48,498
AUDACITY TO DEFEND IT.

169
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:50,299
FOR THEM TO COME OUT AND TRY TO

170
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,434
SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THE

171
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:54,370
TONE OF DONALD TRUMP IS

172
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:54,937
ABSOLUTELY LAUGHABLE.

173
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:56,405
THEY ARE MAKING A JOKE OF

174
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:57,206
THEMSELVES, AND I DIDN'T THINK

175
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,408
THEY COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF

176
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,643
DOING THAT THAN THEY ALREADY

177
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:01,244
HAVE DONE.

178
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:02,245
ABBY: GOVERNOR, THE BATTLE

179
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:03,513
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND MEDIA,

180
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:06,282
IT SEEMS TO ONLY GET HOTTER AND

181
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:06,616
HOTTER.

182
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:07,950
HE SLAMS THEM EVERY TIME.

183
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:09,619
HE POINTS BACK BECAUSE HE KNOWS

184
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,620
THEY'RE STANDING RIGHT THERE,

185
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:11,921
AND THEY CAN'T RESPOND,

186
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:16,325
PEOPLE, DISGUSTING, CALLS THEM

187
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:17,126
OUT BY NAME.

188
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:18,294
DO YOU THINK THIS IS HELPFUL IN

189
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,896
THE LONG RUN, OR IS HE MAKING

190
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:22,165
THEM THE STORY?

191
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,599
>> WELL, THEY SHOULD NEVER BE

192
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,300
THE STORY.

193
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:25,601
I MEAN, PERSONALLY, I WOULD

194
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,537
PREFER THAT HE SPENDS MORE TIME

195
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:28,504
IGNORING THEM BECAUSE I DON'T

196
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:29,705
THINK THEY MATTER THAT MUCH TO

197
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,107
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN VOTER.

198
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:32,842
AND I THINK HE'S GOT TO

199
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:33,876
DISTINGUISH THE FACT THAT NOT

200
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,444
ALL THE PRESS ARE THE ENEMY OF

201
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:38,915
BEST THING WE HAVE IN A

202
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,282
DEMOCRACY.

203
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:40,917
OF IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR

204
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:41,284
SURVIVAL.

205
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,619
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN,

206
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,121
THE PRESS NEEDS TO ACT WITH SOME

207
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,726
LIKE THE GUY ON CNN WHO ENJOYS

208
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,228
BECOMING THE STORY, LET ME TELL

209
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,863
YOU SOMETHING, WHENEVER A

210
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,131
JOURNALIST BECOMES PART OF THE

211
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:56,732
STORY, IT'S NO LONGER A NEWS

212
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,169
BECAUSE THE BEST JOURNALISTS ARE

213
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,705
THE ONES WHO SIMPLY DUI YOU

214
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:04,140
THE -- GIVE YOU THE FACTS, AND

215
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,808
THEY REALLY ARE NOT PART OF THE

216
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:07,944
STORY AT ALL, THEIR VIEWS, THEIR

217
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:10,379
OPINIONS, THEIR BIASES ARE

218
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,247
SUBJUGATED TO THE FACTS

219
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:12,648
THEMSELVES AND LET THE READER OR

220
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:14,350
THE VIEWER MAKE THE DECISION.

221
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:15,384
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING VERY MUCH

222
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:17,186
ANYWHERE IN JOURNALISM TODAY.

223
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:24,594
PETE: YEAH.

224
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,162
AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S POINTING

225
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:26,429
OUT.

226
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,430
IT'S BEEN A DOUBLE STANDARD FOR

227
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,400
ANOTHER HALLMARK OF THE LEFT HAS

228
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,835
BEEN THE USE OF IDENTITY

229
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:34,237
POLITICS AND THE USE OF RACE AND

230
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:35,972
GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS

231
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:39,742
THE WAY OF CLASSIFYING SOMEONE.

232
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:41,344
WELL, KAMALA HARRIS, WE ALL KNOW

233
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:43,946
IS ON THE 2020 LIST, SENATOR

234
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:44,714
FROM CALIFORNIA.

235
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:45,915
SHE TOOK THAT HEAD ON, AND WE

236
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,217
WANT YOU TO REACT.

237
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:48,784
LISTEN.

238
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,753
>> THAT PHRASE, IDENTITY

239
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,292
AND IT IS USED TO DISTRACT.

240
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,862
IT IS USED TO TRY AND SHUT US

241
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:00,296
UP.

242
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:03,699
THESE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE TRYING

243
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,270
TO DIMINISH AND DEMEAN ARE THE

244
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:11,707
VERY ISSUES THAT WILL DEFINE OUR

245
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,981
DEFINE OUR IDENTITY AS

246
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:19,348
AMERICANS.

247
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:21,384
>> IN KAMALA HARRIS' WORLD, IN

248
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:23,319
THE WORLD OF MOST OF THE LEFTIST

249
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,754
DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE THE CLEAREST

250
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:25,921
EXAMPLE OF THE DIFFERENCE

251
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,189
BETWEEN A CONSERVATIVE AND A

252
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,158
LIBERAL, AND HERE IT IS:

253
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,160
CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THAT OUR

254
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,429
BASIC FORM AS A NATION IS BUILT

255
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,697
AROUND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, THAT

256
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,599
I'M PERSONALLY FREE AND I'M

257
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,867
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MY

258
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:38,701
FREEDOM.

259
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:43,372
IN, WHETHER IT'S MY GENDER,

260
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:44,974
WHETHER IT'S MY RACE, WHETHER

261
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:47,977
IT'S MY SOCIOECONOMIC STANDARD,

262
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,146
AND THAT I'VE GOT TO STAY IN MY

263
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:50,446
GROUP.

264
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,481
IF MY WHOLE GROUP DOESN'T

265
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,316
ADVANCE, I CAN'T ADVANCE BECAUSE

266
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,617
IT'S ABOUT THE GROUP, NOT THE

267
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,988
THE RIGHT, THERE IT IS.

268
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:00,289
DO YOU BELIEVE IN INDIVIDUAL

269
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,392
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE PART OF GROUP

270
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:03,693
THINK.

271
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:04,727
AND IF YOU THINK THAT IT'S ALL

272
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:06,696
ABOUT THE GROUPS AND YOU STAY IN

273
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,130
YOUR CORRAL AND DON'T LEAVE

274
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,266
UNTIL THE WHOLE HERD OF SHEEP GO

275
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:11,667
OUT, WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE

276
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:13,102
A LIBERAL.

277
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,404
SECONDLY, I HOPE YOU LIKE WHERE

278
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,806
YOUR HERD IS, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

279
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:17,373
GETTING OUT.

280
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:18,808
I'M GRATEFUL TO LIVE IN A

281
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,509
COUNTRY THAT LET ME GET OUT OF

282
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,345
SOME OF THE CORRALS THAT I WAS

283
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:23,779
PUT IN AS A CHILD, YOU KNOW, IN

284
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,316
TERM THE OF POVERTY, IN TERMS OF

285
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,618
NEVER THINKING I'D GO 50 MILES

286
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:30,453
FROM MY HOME.

287
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:32,288
I GREW UP BELIEVING THAT IN

288
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,723
AMERICA YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, BE

289
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:34,724
ANYTHING IF YOU ARE WILLING TO

290
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:36,158
WORK HARD, GET AN EDUCATION AND

291
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,127
NOT GO AROUND CALLING YOURSELF A

292
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:38,694
VICTIM.

293
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,262
THANK GOD I LIVE IN AMERICA, AND

294
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:42,231
I'LL BE GRATEFUL EVERY DAY FOR

295
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,467
THE EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGE OF

296
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:46,669
BEING INDIVIDUALLY FREE.

297
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,104
ABBY: THAT IS VERY WELL SAID,

298
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:48,471
GOVERNOR.

299
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:49,672
GRIFF: THANK YOU, GOVERNOR,

300
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:51,207
BECAUSE NOW I'M HUNGRY FOR THAT

301
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:55,811
FLASHBACKS TO THE FAIR WE WENT

302
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:58,247
TO WITH REO SPEEDWAGON.

303
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:01,450
I WAS A BACK-UP SINGER SINGING

304
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:02,685
GO, JOHNNY GO.

305
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,453
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

306
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:08,157
I WISH WE HAD VIDEO TO PROVE IT.

307
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:10,993
>> TOM VILSACK PLAYING THE

308
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:12,962
SPOONS, GOVERNOR OF IOWA AND A

309
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:13,796
GREAT FRIEND OF OURS.

310
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:15,264
HE WAS THE HOST GOVERNOR, SO

311
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,832
THEY GOT HIM UP ON THE STAGE,

312
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,667
AND HE DIDN'T PLAY AN

313
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:19,935
INSTRUMENT, BUT HE PLAYED THE

314
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:20,269
SPOONS.

315
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,704
I FELT BAD FOR HIM BECAUSE THE

316
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:23,939
DES MOINES PAPER EXCORIATED HIM

317
00:09:23,940 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR SAYING HE HAD HUCKABEE ON
