1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:01,796
VOLUNTARILY TESTIFY BEFORE THE

2
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:02,931
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND

3
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:03,898
ANY OTHER CONGRESSIONAL

4
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:05,400
INQUIRIES.

5
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,868
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.

6
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:08,269
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, THANK YOU.

7
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,972
LET'S GET SOME ANALYSIS FROM

8
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:12,073
LEGAL SCHOLAR JONATHAN TURLEY OF

9
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:12,807
GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY.

10
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,476
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

11
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:16,010
WHAT STRUCK YOU FROM TODAY'S

12
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,611
HEARING?

13
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:18,113
>> WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING

14
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:19,481
WAS THE DIFFERENT NARRATIVES,

15
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:22,117
THE FACT IS THE IG WAS NOT

16
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:23,118
LIKELY TO FIND THAT DECISIONS

17
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:25,487
WERE BASED ON BIAS.

18
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:26,921
BUT ALSO IT'S NOT TRUE THAT HE

19
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:27,956
DIDN'T FIND BIAS.

20
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:30,658
HE ACTUALLY FOUND A LOT OF BIAS.

21
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:32,026
IT'S JUST THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO

22
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:34,696
ASSUME THAT THE BIAS HE FOUND

23
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:37,665
WAS THE CAUSE OF DECISIONS TAKEN

24
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:38,666
BY THE FBI.

25
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,734
>> Bret: NOT HIS MANDATE.

26
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,069
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

27
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,270
UNLESS SOMEONE WAS GOING TO

28
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,272
CONFESS OR HELP OUT WITH AN

29
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:45,840
EMAIL DETAILING SOME CONSPIRACY,

30
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,176
THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE A

31
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:49,844
FINDING THAT BIAS DROVE THE

32
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:50,211
DECISIONS.

33
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,679
BUT THE REPUBLICANS WERE

34
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,480
CORRECT.

35
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,281
THE REPORT IS HEAVILY LADEN WITH

36
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:57,051
VERY DISTURBING BIAS, INCLUDING

37
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:57,719
FROM THE CHIEF INVESTIGATOR.

38
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,588
THE QUESTION IS THAT WASN'T HIS

39
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:00,922
MANDATE.

40
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:02,090
HE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THOSE

41
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,725
ASSUMPTIONS, SO WHERE DO YOU GO

42
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:04,659
FROM HERE?

43
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,894
THE ANSWER IN THE CONSTITUTION

44
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,195
AS YOU GO TO CONGRESS.

45
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:09,664
CONGRESS HAS AN OVERSIGHT DUTY

46
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:10,698
TO LOOK INTO THIS.

47
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:11,866
SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE

48
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:14,068
SIMPLY NOT ANSWERED.

49
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,069
FOR EXAMPLE, LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS

50
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:16,271
CORRECT TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF

51
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:20,108
CLINTON'S I.T. EXPERT WHO WAS

52
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,677
ACCUSED OF LYING REPEATEDLY TO

53
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:24,846
THE FBI, SCRUBBING HER SERVER

54
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:26,014
AFTER BEING TOLD IT WAS PART OF

55
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:27,482
AN INVESTIGATION AND SOMETHING

56
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:28,483
CONGRESS WAS LOOKING FOR AND

57
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:30,652
TOOK ALL THESE ACTIONS THAT

58
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,187
WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED, AND MOST

59
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:34,622
OF OUR VIEW, AN ACTUAL CRIMINAL

60
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:34,956
CHARGE.

61
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:37,058
INSTEAD THEY GIVE HIM IMMUNITY

62
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,226
WHICH AT THE TIME LEFT ALL OF US

63
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:39,727
AS DUMBFOUNDED AS TO WHY YOU

64
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:42,263
WOULD POSSIBLY DO THIS.

65
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:43,665
THOSE QUESTIONS AREN'T ANSWERED

66
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,266
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE MANDATE.

67
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,801
>> Bret: AFTER READING THE IG

68
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,603
REPORT AND SEEN THE TESTIMONY,

69
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:49,404
THE CASE FOR THE OBSTRUCTION OF

70
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,472
JUSTICE.

71
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:53,808
>> THIS IG REPORT MAKES IT

72
00:01:53,808 --> 00:01:56,244
DIFFICULT OBSTRUCTION CLAIM

73
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:56,878
BASED ON THE COMEY FIRING

74
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:59,681
VIRTUALLY INCONCEIVABLE.

75
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,883
YOU HAVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

76
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:02,684
SAYING THAT COMEY WAS

77
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:03,718
INSUBORDINATE.

78
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,653
50 DEVIATED FROM POLICIES, THAT

79
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:07,088
THESE WERE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS.

80
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,090
FBI DIRECTOR ECHOED THAT.

81
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,291
GOOD REASONS TO FIRE HIM.

82
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,394
UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE

83
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:14,229
ASSUMPTIONS THAT TRUMP ACTED FOR

84
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:15,663
EVERY WRONG REASON INSTEAD OF

85
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:16,764
THE OBVIOUS RIGHT ONES, IT'S

86
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:18,499
GOING TO BE REAL HARD TO MAKE

87
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,200
OUT A CRIMINAL CASE.

88
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,668
>> Bret: THERE WERE OTHER

89
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:22,203
TEASES OF THINGS TO COME,

90
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:24,405
ANOTHER IG REPORT.

91
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:27,675
SOUNDED LIKE SEVERAL LEAK

92
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:28,476
INVESTIGATION INTO COMEY'S

93
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:30,278
PERSONAL USE OF EMAIL AND

94
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:31,012
WHETHER THERE WAS CLASSIFIED

95
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:31,479
MATERIAL THERE.

96
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,082
>> IF I WAS COMEY, I WOULD HEAR

97
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:35,250
A WHISTLE ON THE TRACK.

98
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,884
WE ARE LOOKING AT HIS REMOVING

99
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:37,885
THESE MEMOS FROM THE FBI WHICH

100
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:39,887
I'VE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING IS

101
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,022
CLEARLY FBI MATERIAL.

102
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:43,091
THE FBI HAS INDICATED THAT.

103
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:43,891
ONE MIGHT OF HAD CLASSIFIED

104
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,093
INFORMATION IN IT.

105
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,262
I CAN IMAGINE THE

106
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:47,996
INSPECTOR GENERAL SAYING OKAY,

107
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:51,599
THAT'S FINE.

108
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,767
FEEL YOU CAN REMOVE ANY FILES

109
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:54,402
YOU WANT AND LICK THEM TO THE

110
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:54,702
MEDIA.

111
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:55,670
THAT TRAIN IS GOING TO COME AND

112
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,839
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR

113
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,139
COMEY.

114
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,507
>> Bret: THE FIRST STORY AND

115
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:00,942
THE ONE THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF

116
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:01,476
ATTENTION, WITH THE

117
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:03,678
ADMINISTRATION IS DOING, WHAT

118
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:05,280
DEMOCRATS ARE DOING, WHAT

119
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,482
CONGRESS CAN OR SHOULD DO ON

120
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:08,483
THIS CASE WITH SEPARATING

121
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:10,151
PARENTS AND CHILDREN ALONG THE

122
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,485
BORDER.

123
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:12,153
>> IT'S A SAD STORY BECAUSE AS

124
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:13,721
USUAL IN WASHINGTON, THERE IS

125
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,690
TRUTH AND FALSITY ON BOTH SIDES.

126
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,858
EVERYONE SPINNING THIS AND IN

127
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:18,493
THE MIDDLE ARE THESE KIDS.

128
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:19,560
THE FACT IS THE ADMINISTRATION

129
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,628
DOES NOT HAVE TO SEPARATE THE

130
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:23,097
KIDS FROM THEIR MOTHERS.

131
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:24,132
THAT'S A CHOICE.

132
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:24,966
IT'S A POLICY CHOICE.

133
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,968
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THIS ISSUE

134
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,503
HAS BEEN FORCED BY A CHANGE IN

135
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:30,605
POLICY TO TREAT THESE AS

136
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,307
CRIMINAL MATTERS.

137
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,474
SOMETHING MANY CITIZENS SUPPORT.

138
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,310
DONALD TRUMP WAS BROUGHT TO

139
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,078
POWER BECAUSE HE PLEDGED TO GET

140
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,413
TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION.

141
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:39,113
GETTING TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION

142
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:41,716
MEANS TO SWITCH FROM A CIVIL OR

143
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:42,383
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS TO A

144
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:42,817
CRIMINAL ONE.

145
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,419
ONCE YOU DO THAT, YOU HAVE THESE

146
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,721
TYPE OF SEPARATION PROBLEMS.

147
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,256
THERE IS TRUTH ON BOTH SIDES.

148
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,058
THERE ARE SOME AGREEMENTS AND

149
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:51,893
SOME LAWS THAT GOVERN HOW LONG

150
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:52,660
AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU

151
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,864
HOLD CHILDREN.

152
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,232
BUT CAN THE ADMINISTRATION KEEP

153
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,300
THESE FAMILIES TOGETHER?

154
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,902
I THINK THEY COULD.

155
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:01,602
>> Bret: THERE IS A CHOICE

156
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:04,072
THAT'S MADE AT THE BORDER THERE.

157
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:06,407
RICH LOWRY INDICATED IT IN A

158
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:07,675
OP-ED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

159
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:09,877
HE WROTE "U.S. MARSHALS TAKE

160
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:11,212
CUSTODY OF ADULTS AND CHILDREN

161
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:13,715
ARE HELD BY HHS.

162
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:14,649
PROSECUTION OF ADULTS USUALLY

163
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:15,216
HAPPENS QUICKLY.

164
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:17,452
IF THE ADULT WANTS TO RETURN

165
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,553
HOME, SHE OR HE IS REUNITED WITH

166
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,688
THEIR CHILD AND THEY ARE SENT

167
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:21,322
BACK TOGETHER.

168
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:23,324
WHERE IT GETS MORE COMPLICATED

169
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:25,493
IS IF I MIGRANT CLAIMS ASYLUM.

170
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:26,794
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS TO

171
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:27,862
HOLD MIGRANTS PENDING

172
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:28,529
ADJUDICATION OF THOSE CASES.

173
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,264
IF THEY ARE RELEASED, THERE'S

174
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:31,833
GOOD GENES THEY WILL ABSCOND.

175
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,469
EVEN IF CASES ARE HANDLED

176
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,703
QUICKLY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO

177
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:41,476
RELEASE THE SOONER.

178
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,344
IT'S ONE OF THE DISTORTIONS THAT

179
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:44,045
MAKES RATIONAL POLICY OF THE

180
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:46,280
BORDER POLICY.

181
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,882
WHEN A COMPANY CHILDREN FROM

182
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:50,118
MEXICO ACROSS THE BORDER, WE CAN

183
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:50,585
TURN THEM HOME.

184
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:53,321
ANTITRAFFICKING LAW MAKES IT

185
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,655
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT WITH

186
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,456
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN FROM

187
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:56,124
CENTRAL AMERICA."

188
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:56,924
BASICALLY AS LONG AS MIGRANTS

189
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,993
KNOW THEY CAN GET IN, THEY WILL

190
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:01,095
KEEP COMING AND BRINGING THEIR

191
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:01,863
CHILDREN.

192
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:03,664
IF THEY CLAIM ASYLUM, THEY ARE

193
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:04,866
ESSENTIALLY CHOOSING TO SEPARATE

194
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:05,433
FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

195
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:06,501
>> I THINK IT'S DUE TO THE

196
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:10,104
PARADIGM SHIFT.

197
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:11,105
THE ADMINISTRATION WAS TREATING

198
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:11,906
THIS AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

199
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:13,975
PROCESS, NOT A CRIMINAL ONE.

200
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:15,410
THERE WERE FEWER COMPLICATIONS.

201
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,078
ONCE YOU SHIFT TO AN ENFORCEMENT

202
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:19,714
SYSTEM, A CRIMINAL ONE, IT

203
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:20,481
MAGNIFIES THESE PROBLEMS.

204
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:23,351
BY THIS LAW DOES CREATE A

205
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:26,287
GLARING CONFLICT IN THIS 20 DAY

206
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:27,121
CLOCK.

207
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,991
YOU CAN RELEASE BUT THEN YOU

208
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:31,959
HAVE A GAP, MOTHER IS MOVING ON

209
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,693
A DIFFERENT TRACK FROM THE KID.

210
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:36,664
IT'S A LEGITIMATE ISSUE THAT THE

211
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:39,467
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO

212
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:39,801
RESOLVE.

213
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:40,668
>> Bret: SECRETARY NIELSEN

214
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:42,904
SAID THEY COULD GO TO A PORT OF

215
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,806
ENTRY AND CLAIM ASYLUM AND STAY

216
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:46,007
TOGETHER BUT THIS IS DEALING

217
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,309
WITH ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING.

218
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,278
>> BOTH PARTIES ARE PLAYING

219
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:51,279
CHICKEN BUT THERE ARE KIDS IN

220
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,013
THE CAR.

221
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:52,780
I THINK EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE

222
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,783
TO A BREATHER, AND A RARE TIME

223
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:56,684
TO GET TOGETHER AND SAY LET'S

224
00:05:56,684 --> 00:00:00,000
GET IT OFF THE TABLE.
