STEVE: THERE YOU GO. KANYE WEST OVAL OFFICE MEETING ANGERED MANY IN HOLLYWOOD INCLUDING RAPPER T.I. WHO RELEASED A TEASER 1 MINUTE VIDEO FOR HIS NEW ALBUM WITH THE MESSAGE DEAR 45 I AIN'T KANYE. AINSLEY: WHAT'S OUTRAGING MANY PEOPLE FIRST LADY LOOKALIKE STRIPPING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. IN FACT, THE VIDEO IS SO RACEY WE CAN'T EVEN SHOW YOU MOST OF IT. BRIAN: HERE TO REACT FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY. RACHEL, IS IT OKAY TO HAVE THE FIRST LADY DEPICTED AS A STRIPPER EVEN THOUGH IT'S A RAP VIDEO? NO. IT'S NOT OKAY. AND, LISTEN, WE HAVE SEEN ALL KINDS OF THINGS COLONIAL AT THIS FAMILY. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT THE RESISTANCE AND HOLLYWOOD WILL DO TO THIS FAMILY. BUT I REALLY LOOK AT THIS IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. I'M A POLITICAL SPOUSE. SO I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THE KIND OF POWER THAT THE FIRST LADY'S CLUB. THIS IS THE MOST EXCLUSIVE CLUB IN THE WORLD IT INCLUDES MRS. CARTER, MICHELLE OBAMA, LAURA BUSH, I KEEP ASKING WHERE ARE THEY? THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SISTERHOOD, IF YOU WILL, THEY HAVE BEEN SILENT ON THE TREATMENT OF MELANIA TRUMP. AND IT'S ACTUALLY SHOCKING TO ME. IN THE CASE OF MICHELLE OBAMA, SHE ACTUALLY HAS INCREDIBLE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL POWER AT HER FINGER TIPS TO STOP THIS. IT WOULD TAKE ONE VISIT TO ELLEN. ONE VISIT TO JIMMY FALLON OR KIMMEL'S SHOW OR A TWEET TO SAY KNOCK IT OFF. LAY OFF THE PRESIDENT'S FAMILY, ESPECIALLY OUR FIRST LADY. AND IT WOULD END. AT LEAST A LOT OF IT MAYBE YOU CAN'T CONTROL THESE CRAZY RAPPERS, BUT YOU WOULD BE AGE TO GET A LOT OF MAYBE STREAM HOLLYWOOD IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT MAINSTREAM TO. I PERSONALLY FIND HER SILENCE TO BE VERY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE SHE KNOWS SHE HAS THE POWER TO END IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THE MEDIA HAS NEVER ASKED HER WHY SHE WON'T DO THAT ON BEHALF OF MELANIA. AINSLEY: HER SPOKESPERSON AND SHE TWEETED THIS OUT HOW IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO, DISGUSTING, BOYCOTT T.I. DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HELP? DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL BOYCOTT T.I. BECAUSE OF THIS OR MORE PEOPLE GOING TO GO AND WATCH HIS VIDEO? I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THE VIDEO. A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET AT T.I. DOESN'T KNOW WHO T.I. IS AND PROBABLY DON'T CARE ABOUT HIS RAP MUSIC. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS PART OF A GREATER PLAN, WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED, THE RESISTANCE SAID WE WILL NOT NORMALIZE TRUMP THAT INCLUDED HIS FAMILY. AND THAT MEANS ANY VILE ATTACK, ANYTHING THAT DEHUMANIZES THEM, THAT INSULTS THEM, THAT HUE MILL UNITED STATES THEM IS OKAY. AS FAR AS THE RESISTANCE. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE LEADERS OF THE RESISTANCE AND THAT INCLUDES THE OBAMAS, NOT REALLY COMING OUT IN FRONT AND BEING PROTECTIVE OF HER THE WAY FRANKLY ALL OF AMERICA, INCLUDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF REPUBLICANS WERE OF THEIR OWN DAUGHTERS. STEVE: RACHEL IS CALLING ON THE FIRST LADIES TO COME OUT STRONGLY IN OPPOSITION IT THIS VIDEO. YES. STEVE: REAL QUICKLY YOUR TAKE OPT FACT THAT THE RESULTS ARE IN AND ELIZABETH WARREN MAY BE 1,000TH NATIVE AMERICAN. WHAT A DISASTROUS ROLL OUT FOR HER. ACTUALLY EMBARRASSING. AND CHEROKEE NATION, THEY ARE JUST FED UP HER W. HER ANTICS. THEY KNOW SHE HAS USED THEIR TRIBE TO GET ADVANCEMENT IF HER OWN ACADEMIC CAREER. ACTUALLY GENEALOGISTS HAVE GONE BACK THROUGH HER FAMILY TREE AND FOUND HER ANCESTORS WERE ACTUALLY PART OF THE TENNESSEE MILITIA THAT ROUNDED UP CHEROKEES FOR THE TRAIL OF TEARS. THIS IS SHAMEFUL. SHE HAS NO SHAME. THE ONLY PERSONAL THAT BENEFITED FROM HER ROLLOUT, WHICH WAS EMBARRASSING ARE REPUBLICANS AND FRANKLY MAYBE KAMALA HARRIS WHO ACTUALLY LOOKED MORE CREDIBLE AFTER THIS. BRIAN: THEY ARE ALL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020 JUST FORGETTING ABOUT 2018. STEVE: ONE ELECTION AT A TIME. SHE IS SO POLITICALLY SELFISH ON HER PART TO DO
