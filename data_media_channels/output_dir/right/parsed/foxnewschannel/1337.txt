STATE.
GRANTED AN EMERGENCY INJUNCTION
AGAINST THE LAW.
THE CASE CONTINUES IN A LOWER
COURT.
THE PRESIDENT FRESH OFF A RALLY
IN TENNESSEE DRUMMING UP SUPPORT
FOR SENATE HOPEFUL REPUBLICAN
MARSHA BLACKBURN.
SHE IS HOPING TO REPLACE
OUTGOING SENATOR BOB CORKER IN A
RACE THAT IS CONSIDERED FOR NOW
A TOSS-UP.
>> SHE LOVES YOUR STATE.
SHE LOVES HER COUNTRY.
SHE'S GOING TO WIN.
MARSHA BLACKBURN.
>> Shannon: FRESH OFF THE
STAGE WITH THE PRESIDENT
CONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY.
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> Shannon: YOU'RE FACING A
MAN WHO WAS A DEMOCRAT, A VERY
POPULAR FORMER GOVERNOR.
SCOTT AND PRAISES FROM ONE OF
YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ON
THE SENATE SIDE, THE MAN YOU
HOPE TO REPLACE, SENATOR BOB
CORKER.
A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE NICE THINGS
TO SAY.
WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE?
>> WHERE WE GO IS RIGHT TO WORK.
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING
EVERY DAY, SHANNON.
JUST WORKING HARD TO GET OUT OUR
MESSAGE AND TO EARN EVERY SINGLE
VOTE.
AND TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY FOR
US.
WE HAD A FUND-RAISER.
WE HAD A RALLY THAT WAS A PACKED
HOUSE AT NASHVILLE'S MUNICIPAL
AUDITORIUM AND WE ARE LOOKING
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BUILD
THAT ENERGY AND BUILD THAT
NETWORK THAT IS NECESSARY TO WIN
THIS RACE.
>> Shannon: I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
CONFRONTED BY WOMEN ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL WHO DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOUR SUPPORT OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THEY DON'T SUPPORT HIM.
THE GOVERNOR, HE ACTUALLY PULLS
BETTER WITH WOMEN IN THIS RACE
THAN YOU DO.
WHAT A   DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT Y
WHAT A   DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT U
AND HOW WE TRY TO CLOSE THAT
GAP?
>> THE WAY TO CLOSE THAT GAP IS
POINTING TO THE FACT THAT WOMEN
EVERY DAY, DONALD TRUMP'S
NUMBERS EVERY DAY IMPROVED WITH
WOMEN BECAUSE WOMEN KNOW HE IS
WORKING HARD TO MAKE THEIR LIVES
BETTER.
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH
THE ECONOMY, WITH WAGE
INCREASES, WITH JOB
OPPORTUNITIES.
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE
IMPORTANT.
THE ECONOMY, JOBS.
THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY ISSUE IS
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WITH WOMEN.
WOMEN ALSO ARE INCREDIBLY
SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT HE IS DOING
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF
IMMIGRATION, SECURING THE
BORDER, ENDING ILLEGAL ENTRY OF
GANGS, OF DRUGS, OF TRAFFICKING.
THOSE ARE PLACES OF FOCUS.
IT IS A WAY FOR US TO BUILD
BRIDGES WITH MANY WOMEN WHO ARE
INDEPENDENT AND DEMOCRATS, AND I
WILL TELL YOU I HAVE
REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS AND
DEMOCRATS ALL WHO ARE ACTIVE IN
OUR CAMPAIGN AND WHO ARE
SUPPORTING ME.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT
ANOTHER BIG ISSUE.
I JUST TALKED TO THEIR ABOUT THE
SUPREME COURT DECIDING IT WOULD
NOT GET IN THE WAY OF THIS
ARKANSAS LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY
CLINICS WHO ARE USING THIS TO
CODRUG PROTOCOL TO PERFORM
ABORTIONS TO HAVE SOME
CONNECTION WITH THE DOCTOR THAT
WITH AND HAVE HOSPITAL ADMITTING
PRIVILEGES IN THE CASE THAT
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF
COMPLICATION.
TWO PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICS
BASICALLY SAY THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO PERFORM ABORTIONS IN
ARKANSAS.
I KNOW YOU HEADED UP THE HOUSE
SELECT PANEL THAT WAS LOOKING
INTO ALLEGATIONS AGAINST PLANNED
PARENTHOOD.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEIR
ALLEGATION THAT WOMEN ARE GOING
TO BE LEFT WITH BASICALLY ALMOST
NO OPTION THERE IN ARKANSAS
BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED AT THE
SUPREME COURT?
>> I FEEL LIKE PART OF WHAT YOU
WERE HEARING FROM PLANNED
PARENTHOOD IS A LITTLE BIT OF A
REACH.
WHAT ARKANSAS HAS DONE AND WHAT
THE COURT HAS AGREED WITH IS
THAT THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL
PROTECTIONS FOR WOMEN AND FOR
UNBORN CHILDREN AND THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT ARKANSAS DECIDED
THEY WANTED TO PUT IN PLACE IN
THEIR STATE LAWS AND IT WILL GO
INTO EFFECT.
>> Shannon: THIS IS WHAT
PLANNED PARENTHOOD TWEETED
TODAY.
THE FIGHT IS FAR FROM OVER.
THIS LAW CANNOT AND MUST NOT
STAND.
WE WILL NOT STOP FIGHTING FOR
EVERY PERSON'S RIGHT TO HAVE
ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL
ABORTIONS.
IT'S CLEAR THEY PLAN TO CONTINUE
THE LEGAL FIGHT.
A NUMBER OF SIMILAR LAWS AROUND
THE COUNTRY ARE BEING CHALLENGED
THE COUNTRY ARE BEING CHALLENGE
CHALLENGED.
THERE ARE SPLIT DECISIONS WITH
THE COURT.
WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE GOING
AS FAR AS THIS ISSUE ENDING UP
AT THE SUPREME COURT AGAIN ON A
LARGER SCALE?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.
WHERE DOES IT TAKE US FROM HERE?
AND WHAT WE HEAR IS IF THESE
GROUPS ARE FOR SAFE, LEGAL,
RARE, THEN THEY SHOULD WANT SOME
PROTECTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS
THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE TO
HELP INFORM WOMEN, TO HELP
EDUCATE WOMEN, TO PROTECT WOMEN
AND TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY
ARE GOING TO BE SAFE, TO MAKE
CERTAIN THAT THERE IS THAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH A PHYSICIAN,
WITH A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.
TO ME THAT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT
YOU WOULD WANT THAT FOR IT TO BE
THE SAFEST POSSIBLE CONDITION
FOR THESE WOMEN.
>> Shannon: NOT LONG AGO THE
SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN SOME
SIMILAR REGULATIONS IN THE STATE
OF TEXAS.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK THIS
