I am for me okay and join the stream live on al-jazeera and right now on YouTube today we discuss a new proposal to help rescue migrants and refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe Emily could be loud and later will welcome back past guests one if he OPN one era Tran to explore what renewed relations between the countries means for their people but first have a look at this story from Al Jazeera's Osama bin Javed he reports from Lahore with some of the news about Pakistan's general election millions came out to vote even for those convicted of corruption and serving jail time my vote is for now as Sharif come what may forget the criticism our heart is with him right activists said raise concerns about people manipulation in these elections an international monitors say not enough observers were there due to bureaucratic delays as the votes were being counted supporters of Imran Khan came out to celebrate for them the result was predetermined this is the first time we've had the chance to defeat the two parties who've been in control taking turns at power in an early morning news conference the Muslim League noir said the election was rigged they claimed their party was targeted that coating was deliberately slowed down and results were manipulated not just the pml-n but all major political parties apart from Imran Khan's PTI have rejected the preliminary results on Thursday they will decide what to do next in addition to the political sparring between parties this year's election cycle has been marred by violence in I saw and I still claim bomb attack in the provincial capital of Baluchistan on election day killed at least 30 people joining us now to help us unpack the latest results and the circumstances surrounding Wednesday's vote it's Aras Imam she works as a journalist for voice of America's early language service hello Sarah it's good to have you here hashtag Pakistan elections really Kerrville how what do we oh gosh so much and I think that it's partly because there's a bit of confusion so we saw earlier that there are allegations of vote rigging and yet Imran Khan has come out and declared victory this is what our community thinks about that or at least one member awsome and says this is very simple our economy is in a miserable condition because of massive corruption and money laundering and Imran Khan not only created awareness but is the only non financially corrupt leader in our country so there's some excitement there earlier today he actually came out Imran Khan did and talked about a corruption in a sense he talked about how lavish the Prime Minister's residence is and how he will not be taking it if he assumes office right well this whole thing has been you know I'm gonna be anti-corruption and that is how he took down Pakistan's previous Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif the whole idea was these leaders have been corrupt they've been looting Pakistan's wealth and now is the time to actually not only hold them accountable but kick them out of power so what's been really interesting and what this person has said is exactly what a lot of young people are saying that you know regardless of everything else you know there may be allegations about the fact that you know he has what are so-called electable people who have been part of the setup that has brought Pakistan to the point where Pakistan is at today they're part of Pakistan's problems but they're also electable then so a lot of people were upset that you know Imran Khan for all that he talks about change is still surrounding himself with those kind of people but at the end of the day this idea that you know he has not committed any kind of corruption he you know took public money and built hospitals with that those are the things that have attracted people to him so that's I mean this pretty much sums it up and what the speech that he made today a lot of people are calling it a victory speech but we know that we don't have final results just yet and as far as the rigging is concerned it's actually rather interesting this time so this time there's not really so much this concern that ballot boxes were stuffed with fake votes the concern is what they were calling pre-poll rigging creating an environment where one party kind of has an edge has an easier way to get ahead and making it a little difficult for other parties the parties that have been traditionally in power of August 9 People's Party and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz how to making it how did they do that well it's it's an interesting question because there is no concrete evidence of how this was done but this is how the powers that be always function no matter what country you're in you're never if they are leaving traces then they're not doing a good job right so they're all really leave traces but the idea was you we saw a lot of people who were part of the ruling party Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz pml-n defecting from the party either running as candidates or joining PTI Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf which is Imran Khan's party so that was one example that people used the other example that they were using was the pressure on media it had become harder to criticize the establishment it had become harder to get a narrative across that was not necessarily in line with bhaji establishment wanted so there was an environment that was created according to some you know observer some circles but of course not everybody agrees with that 100% so you'll find a variety of opinion I just taught you a little clip I'm for our viewers as well Shahbaz Sharif he's the president of the pml-n which is the ruling party and he's speaking about voting irregularities and while tackling them and calling them out is so important have a listen it's not about government or opposition it's about the future of this country it's about the mandate of the people it's about you know Pakistan well-being our posterity it's a larger issue so much to talk about there's that bomb attack that I mentioned right at the beginning of the introduction how much does violence characterize this campaign and then this election so if we compare it to the previous election 2013 at that time Pakistan was going through a very difficult phase there was just a lot of terrorism all over Pakistan and there was a very concerted effort to fight it this time overall if you look at Pakistan's security situation it has improved this time the attacks were actually targeting specific people specific parties so in fact I was talking to one of our correspondents on the ground and he said that because of the terror attacks both the ones that happened before the election that one of them killed what approximately 100 50 people and then yesterday's attack killed about 30 people both happening in Balochistan so it affected the number of people who came out to vote it affected voter turnout but overall interestingly the parties that were actually attacked in these two incidents ended up winning seats in the provincial assembly so that was a very interesting thing that came out of it I want to share on that note this tweet from Potts Mountain sorry who says the series of attacks that took place didn't it surprised me most Pakistanis expected a surge in violence prior to the elections as there are forces with conflicting political interests working internally and externally it's sad to read that as an outsider that some are saying well this is business as usual we under we expected this to happen we understand that it it was going to anyway that's part of the Pakistan's larger problem the larger picture in Pakistan because since 9/11 we have seen a wave of terrorism strike Pakistan so no matter what the occasion whether it's you know a religious festival whether it's if shine or whether its elections any time a large number of people have gathered somehow we have in Pakistan sort of become accustomed to this type of you know news occurring it's sad but it has just become part of reality I do want to go back to a previous point and just want to clarify something that other than this idea that before the elections some room is being created for one party the other thing that happened yesterday two things actually happened one was that a couple of parties including the ruling party and one of the other important parties Bhutto's PPP they have said that their political agents were not allowed to be in the rooms when votes will be encountered so they are complaining that there was not enough transparency in this process the other thing that happened incidentally was that the Election Commission of Pakistan was trying electronic voting and that system crashed thank you so much there was a nine hour difference between DC and Pakistan you have been working over time thank you for joining us here on the stream talk about the Pakistan elections and if you are watching and watching out is here and following online have a look at this page here Pakistan Elections 2018 you can keep refreshing it and in seeing how the elections will turn out votes are still being counted so we move now to Majorca Spain where outers errors Katia Lopez Hoda Yan reports on the efforts of aid organizations to rescue people stranded on the Mediterranean Sea a desperate rush to save lives it's the moment rescue workers see stranded migrants in the Mediterranean a 40 year old woman from Cameroon is still alive but for another woman and a toddlers it's too late eight group proact Eva open arms found the migrants and say the deaths were no accident it's accusing Libya's coastguard of manslaughter they say politics came before humanitarian assistance the rescue group says it was denied proper help which made their four-day journey across the Mediterranean longer than needed the Libyan Coast Guard denies the accusations it says it rescued 165 migrants in that same area last week without leading anyone on board but the rescue team insists this case has broader political implications it's unthinkable for a country of the European Union for my country to finance the Libyan Coast Guard which we can testify leaves people alive in the middle of the sea and is responsible for homicide a desperate journey with a tragic end that's claimed the lives of so many migrants now a call for political action when humanitarian help alone is not enough the migration across the Mediterranean has dropped significantly since 2015 data from the UN refugee agency and the missing migrants project reports that within the last six months 28 out of every 1000 people who attempt to journey the journey across the Mediterranean died at sea Jarrid canals is the mission coordinator for proactive or open arms that's the aid organisation you just saw there in Katie's report so right it's good to have you here it is really hard to get a sense of what is happening out at sea just by talking about it so I went to the proactive er arms dot org page and you can see the kind of missions that you go on can you explain that to our audience who are watching this video and what are they seeing on what you do well and what we do is we stay at sea we have two ships operational we stay at sea and we look for those who are fleeing Olivia in that dream that supposed to reach European coast but that with the assets that they are provided with terrible rubber and wooden boats and there is no way that they do it but by themselves so they are left adrift usually without food and without gasoline and without any way to navigate north so in the end they will die if no one else and can help them so that's what we do usually we we stay outside of the territorial waters around the 30 nautical miles and from that position we respond to the distress situation that we find out so you are now based in Barcelona Spain and the crossings are actually happening along that northern coast of Africa you are a long way away from where people are crossing what problems is a course well usually we used to be based in Malthus or just one day away from the Tsar zone but now because of the political situation we will find ourselves banned from entry either to Maltese waters and to Italian water so now we have to to go to the closest port for us the closest European port for us and a niche at home in Barcelona so from there we have to make a long trip about four days traveling to the surf zone logistically is very hard for us because we are losing a lot of a lot of time on the way we have to invest a lot of money for for the petrol for example and also to find to find crew is harder because now we have to stay longer period see and in the end all that provokes less days on the Sur area and less ships on the Solaria less days on this area it will become more deaths but Gerard you mentioned being blocked from Italian waters our our community is talking about what some of these host countries reluctant host countries are doing at this moment it really being one of them the government recently retracted a European Commission plan to pay 6000 euros to any government that would help take people that were rescued from boats and this is what HT Flores thinks of that he says this isn't a real offer 6,000 euros would only last for a limited amount of time and after that the Italian government would have to cover the cost which far exceed the amount offer a better offer would be if the EC were to match any expenditures spent on refugees and this is a hot topic so we got several comments on this this is another one from someone who says consider any nation that accepts this deal has an incentive to spend far less per immigrant not providing services or aid if the cost of those services in aid would surpass the 6000 euro amount this means either vast deportation or horrible conditions of long-term detention when you think of this policy Gerard what do you think the repercussions will be look I can talk much about how to solve the situation if it has to be solved through paying 6,000 you go to the country who will assist taking these people I don't know our expertise is in the surf zone and that's what we know how to do for me the problem should be solved looking to the origin of the countries what are the problems that they are facing at home and this is not something that they will fix in a short time but for the situation that the people there for the people that we are rescuing at sea we need to be provided for a port close port to disembark and then these people should be redistributed through Europe by other means not by the rescue ships if the countries that get these people should get six twelve or twenty thousand I don't know this is this is not something I can say that obviously 6,000 euros is not enough to sustain a life of a person for very long in Europe sure I was just thinking about the change in the atmosphere between 2015 when so many refugees and migrants were crossing from North Africa across to the Mediterranean and what's happening right now where there are countries are very hostile to those same people trying to get into those countries and their ports are closed I'm wondering if you feel that there is some kind of unofficial unwritten policy where they have decided those countries has decided it's okay for people to drown well it looks like this is the new policy of Europe they just do nothing and they make this see volunteer that we have this border that we have that is Mediterranean Sea take the life for those who are trying to cross it and that's what is happening right now all the assets of Europe are far away from from this surf zone so only the military assets which are there not for search and rescue but intelligent operations and other and asked yes that's not enough that's that's not enough but this is what they want it seems that they want the the North African countries to know to let the people know that if they try to cross by sea they will die they were dying yeah do you think it will prevent the ultimate sanction Jerell thank you so much for updating us on your organization's rescue efforts on the Mediterranean Sea appreciated you're welcome finally take a look back to this conversation we had in June about renewed diplomatic ties between Ethiopia and Eritrea and what political scientists and researchers Rahel Rada had to said about the potential for peace I hope it was serious serious about having peace with Eritrea they would demilitarize the boarder relations and it would it would be think about this in terms of you know should we have pillars or our walls to make the borders if Ethiopia fully agrees with the BBC just final decision and remove their troops normalization will not talk we're not going to discuss what to put the poles we're going to talk about how we can celebrate you know our diversity and commonalities between these borders between we're happy to welcome back to the stream Rahul who joins us from Stockholm Sweden and a wall alo a lecturer in law at Keele University in the UK welcome back to both of you that was a heated discussion we had last time and Rahul you were saying that there will be a normalization effect you were looking forward to normalizing relations and said that's when we can talk about peace and what comes next since then this happened look at my screen here you see Natalie tweets flat are lining the main streets banners and English Tigrinya and Amharic aroma are going up there's an air of excitement what an interesting time to be an Apsara and this was for the welcoming of the Ethiopian Prime Minister as you can see the signs they're welcome dear brother Evy Ahmed a lot of excitement there I know personally for you raha you were at a peace rally a couple weeks ago marching alongside people from Ethiopia when someone took your flag tell us about that story yes there was a woman there who had small Ethiopian flags and she asked to exchange her flag and my flag so I found myself yeah with an Ethiopian flag in my hand and it was surreal really because I I didn't imagine that I would be holding an Ethiopian flag and Ahmet and being able to imagine the opportunities of Piet that peace will provide for us now that things are going really well between the countries I'm looking at this story here it's from MPR in the States and it says here I am calling randomly to say hi our trains Ethiopians phone each other amid before what other stories do you have of this this this warming relationships between Ethiopia and Eritrea it's incredible so when we will this show about a month ago the discussion we were having was in a completely different spirit we were talking about whether Arapaho would ever be possible between the two countries because of the depths of the bitterness and the anger and the pain that is left behind by the war and we were talking about why there it a government has not replied nearly two weeks after the European governments extended that Olive Branch and now what we have suddenly is this sudden explosion of sentiments and expression of solidarity in love and affection and and forgiveness I mean nobody thoughts that will suddenly move from the state of war into the kind of you know images and pictures of seen an expressive ringing of different ways it was for me I think one of the most incredible and remarkable money in the history of peacemaking I would say hmm so from a state of war to this new state of peace for finding peace we got this coming here from nan jela and the shifting the conversation a little bit because she says there are still a number of political prisoners and journalists in jail and Eritrea and there should be they should be released as a symbol of a renewed commitment to turning over a new leaf so raha I bring this up because we have seen in the run-up to these new relations we we saw the release of political prisoners in Ethiopia we saw moves on the part of the Ethiopian government to bring about a thaw people online are saying now what is the Eritrean government going to do could take a look here here's another one this is a hashtag that's trending questions for isaiah's and you just run through that list and there are lots of questions that people have for the Eritrean layer a leader on what he will be doing can you speak to that at all well I cannot speak on behalf of the Eritrean government because of course I'm not part of the Eritrean government not what I was asking you to do but more on the idea that people are calling on their government to put something forward in good faith not absolutely the no war no peace situation no longer exists security between the countries have relaxed the the board has already started to become demilitarized and so I don't I expect it to be a lot of reform in Editora there's been talk about returning the military service to its regular 18 months instead of it being indefinite there's been news that aerotrain troops on their side of the border have also pulled back from the the border line as you know a lot of things are moving very fast it's only been a month and we've seen very drastic epic changes but then we also need to remind ourselves that it still took 18 to 20 years to reach this space and and it will take us time it will take all of us not just the government's but also the for the people to you know to internalize this normalization process to heal from the traumas that they have experienced over the years and I truly believe that the people will do that they've already showed how very forgiving resilient loving they are as they went out to the streets to support each leader visiting the country also the Ethiopian Airlines has commenced flights to Oz Mara if you're Eritrean Airlines will do the same student to Ethiopia and there's an so much love and mutual respect between the people although we it's gonna take time there's not going to be a short term thing that will be solved I believe that with the faith and love of the people it will go quick and I think that things will change also an air tour quite quickly well what did you want to add I saw you writing down a little note yeah I mean I think the the obvious dividends of peace in a quantity such as this where one of the country's huge a security problem with this neighbor are separated is to keep such a tight grip over the population is always either opening up and the relaxing of the political system and the political space and I think it is here will no longer have that justification that there is this huge country on the border that is keeping such a huge army ready to invade it that justification disappears when the education disappears you know if not much else you've done if it doesn't automatically push the return government to open up at least it will give people the opportunity to say now there is no security problem with you there why are we keeping this tight so it'll open up space I think for activism for resistance and struggle for the Eritrean people and I think that is primarily for the Eritrean people and it is important for us in to Europeans we were just emerging out of a highly repressive system and it will be insulted struggling and it is a state of transition but I think what we need to do as Ethiopians is to respect any trade an independent sovereign nation I have the Malaga cause because it doesn't mean that we have one and the same loving each other is a good point to end this on because the last time I was watching you two together it was slightly animated and slightly tense I'm feeling the love emanating from the screen right now thank you for joining us on this episode of the stream and you can keep
