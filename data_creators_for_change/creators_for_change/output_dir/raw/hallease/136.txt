a big chap or something but now in my

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,649
heart of hearts I'm considering starting

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,090
a second set of locks and it's

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,850
interesting because I had almost done

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,059
this like is almost happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,719
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> August if you watch the first video</font>

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,000
I did for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth speaker company</font>

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,260
your bluetooth headphones company

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,080
calling to the video and also the video

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of me and mr. Hawley's going to Cancun</font>

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,700
for our anniversary you'll see what I'm

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,520
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I had started I had</font>

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,640
this grand idea in

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,860
oh my gosh what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cipriana</font>

27
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kwan's method and just like be adjacent</font>

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,250
to that method a little bit like I'm

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,710
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yannick wanna chase it oh I'm</font>

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,930
she's for just<font color="#CCCCCC"> foresee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and she's got</font>

31
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,540
crazy awesome amount of hair on her head

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,210
and the way she maintains her hair is

33
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,520
loose two strand twists that's how she

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,380
maintains her hair she keeps it that way

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,259
it's like 150 of them are so she wears

36
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,490
her hair like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for about a month</font>

37
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,900
straight and then she takes them down

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,700
washes her hair conditions and it puts

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,950
him back he didn't pick it so it's like

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,039
just constant protective styling um I

41
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,229
wanted to be like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason to that</font>

42
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,259
because I can't go a month without

43
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,450
washing my hair because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very active</font>

44
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,910
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to keep my dandruff</font>

45
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,410
and check and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that kind of stuff so</font>

46
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,750
I really couldn't go that long but I was

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,270
like so what if I'm adjacent and I just

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,429
like still wash my hair twist so

49
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,780
obviously it didn't I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it worked but</font>

50
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,250
like my hair started locking um to the

51
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,950
point where when I came back from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cancun</font>

52
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,280
I actually really was kind of like well

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,540
I guess I have blocks now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

54
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,660
but then a week later I changed my mind

55
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">again and combed them out but to that</font>

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,489
regimens credit I did maintain a lot of

57
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,610
hair and

58
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,650
breakage or anything I mean I had to sit

59
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,290
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pick stuff out but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

60
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,310
what else anyway what at the point I'm

61
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,370
trying to say is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally going</font>

62
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,840
through the big chop it's made me

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize how much I miss my locks and how</font>

64
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">much I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just missed that style so right</font>

65
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,180
now my hair is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two inches long</font>

66
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,640
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on par because I cut my hair</font>

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,770
about four months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hair supposed</font>

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,260
to grow a half an<font color="#E5E5E5"> inch a month so that's</font>

69
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,020
on par with where it should be I would

70
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,510
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start my locks if I do this I</font>

71
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,580
reserve the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change my mind</font>

72
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,520
again but if I do start<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new set of</font>

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,650
blocks I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have around five</font>

74
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,290
or six inches<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hair so that way i can</font>

75
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,230
start my locks with two strand twists

76
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,290
rather than coal coils my first set of

77
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,900
blocks for chrome coils and just the

78
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,580
research that I've done knowing my hair

79
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,850
the way I do now I would rather start

80
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,670
doing with twists I would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

81
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,180
have more locks goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like main status</font>

82
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,060
I would love just made you know anyway I

83
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,830
mean locks that's the point of locks

84
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,480
though is that you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into them with an</font>

85
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,670
idea and then of course they do their

86
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,530
own thing and you learn to grow in your

87
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,630
patient and all of that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so</font>

88
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,880
that's ideally what I want but it could

89
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,590
easily not be that and I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be</font>

90
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">just as happy so yeah that's kind of</font>

91
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,170
where I'm at right now with my hair is

92
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,410
I'm basically maintaining it to maybe

93
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,790
