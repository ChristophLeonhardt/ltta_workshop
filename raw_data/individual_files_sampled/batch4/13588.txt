all right well the media think Trump is gone on his way out but is he Trump takes to Twitter to fight back the Republicans finally pass a tax bill plus the President of the United States sounds off on ROI more and we'll go through all of the biblical allusions to taxes yes really I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so much coming up and I'm gonna give you an intellectually honest look at whether President Trump is really in trouble over this whole Mike Flynn indictment thing what the Mike Flynn indictment thing actually means I don't think it means nearly as much as the media are making it out to me I think the media are are way out in front of what the news is actually showing and in fact it seems to me that the Flynn indictment in some ways actually shows that the Muller investigation is not going to end with anything except for a political prosecution of the President of the United States by Democrats I want to get to all of that I also want to get to a huge Supreme Court case that is going to be discussed tomorrow I'm gonna talk about the tax bill we'll talk about all those things but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so you

so we start of course with the big news that broke on Friday that Mike Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI the indictment showed that that was really all that was there and I had speculated two possibilities possibility number one is that he pled to lesser charges in order to the FBI could get him to flip on Trump possibility number two is that this is basically all the FBI had and now the FBI is just gonna charge a bunch of people for lying to the FBI in the absence of any crime remember when Mike Flynn the former national security adviser was charged with was lying to the FBI about him making phone calls to the Russian ambassador surrogate kiss Lake on December 22nd what exactly did he say in those phone calls that was so all-fired terrible apparently he called up and he said President Obama on his way out is attempting to create these new sanctions he wants to demonstrate that that Hillary Clinton lost because we cheated in the election don't worry about it the sanctions are never really going to be taking effect they're not going to damage you just hold your fire and Putin said okay okay so that's really nothing special okay it's a transition team he was about to enter office as the National Security Advisor three weeks later the people who are saying well it's a Logan Act violation the Logan Act prevents you from basically making your own foreign policy but it's not clear that the Logan Act is even constitutional it was passed into law in 1799 it has never convicted anyone in 218 years it is not convicted a person not one so the idea that suddenly it's going to be applied for the Trump administration is absurd you've seen many Democrats who have applied their own foreign policy while Republicans were in office while their Democrats were in office for them for that matter and Jimmy Carter basically ran North Korean foreign policy while Bill Clinton was in office Teddy Kennedy tried to go over to the USSR and then make a deal with the USSR so that they would help affect the 1984 election cycle so that he could get in right but Barack Obama was conducting calls with other members of foreign governments long before he took office in 2009 all this stuff has been happening routinely so the idea that Mike Flynn did anything deeply wrong by contact when the Russian ambassador is absurd also apparently he asked the Russian ambassador to help stymie a UN resolution that Barack Obama was trying to push in his final days to slap Israel over so-called settlements and and so kiss lyac was called by flynn presumably at the behest of Jared Kushner and Kushner said if you could back off that day I'd be nice again I don't see anything wrong with any of this I really don't see anything terrible about this but he did lie to the FBI so now what it looks like is that Robert Muller is putting together a bunch of charges based on lied to the FBI well if this turns out to be a bunch of people who lied to the FBI about non criminal activity as I said last week this sounds a lot like scooter Libby's scooter libby if you recall was an aide to vice president dick cheney during the w administration and there was a story going around that someone in the White House had leaked the personal information of Valerie Plame a CIA agents in order to get revenge on her husband Joe Wilson because Joe Wilson had written a long op-ed in the Washington Post about how the Bush administration had been wrong about WMD in Iraq it turned out that it was Richard Armitage over at the State Department who had leaked Valerie Plame's name but Scooter Libby sort of either got a conversation wrong or lied about a conversation to the FBI he was prosecuted he was put in jail and Bush commuted his sentence this sounds a lot like that right scooter libby didn't actually commit any crime other than lying to the FBI lines of the FBI is a crime but if there's no underlying crime it's not Watergate Watergate was a bunch of lies about an actual crime a break-in at the Watergate Hotel that was designed to put bugs in the Democratic National Headquarters okay nothing like that has happened here there's no evidence of any actual crime by anyone in the Trump administration with regard to collusion with regards to working with the Russian government no charges of serious crime and all the rumors that Mike Flynn was going to be charged with corrupt ties to Turkey or to Russia none of that materialized Andy McCarthy over at National Review here's a really fascinating piece in which he discusses at length the idea that there would be some sort of deal cut where Flynn only gets prosecuted with the smallest possible crimes and he's like on the bigger ones in order to kind of deal with me says that's not the way it works with prosecutors Andy McCarthy former federal prosecutor he says what you do is you actually prosecute the biggest crimes and then you say in the plea agreement that he's going to get off on lesser years for bigger crimes unless he works with us because the problem is once you file charges the charges are filed right so if all they're filing charges on are the lesser charges that's not much of a threat to Mike Flynn so all this talk about how inevitably the it must be the mother has something really terrible on Flynn and Flynn is gonna say something really terrible about Trump not a lot of evidence that in any case so president Trump responds over the weekend it's not really bright you know the president of the United States really should keep his mouth shut on this stuff or he should send out his lawyers to say something but the president always feels the need to sound off himself and in doing so he gets himself in a little bit of hot water here is President Trump defending my plane well I feel badly for general Flynn I feel very badly he's led a very strong life and I feel very badly John I will say this Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI nothing happened to her Flynn lied and they destroyed his life I think it's a shame Hillary Clinton on the 4th of July weekend went to the FBI not under oath it was the most incredible thing anyone's ever seen she lied many times nothing happened to her Flynn lied and it's like they ruined his life the most incredible thing anyone has ever seen in history is what Hillary Clinton did Hillary Clinton will always be the go-to for President Trump but Trump is not wrong when he says that Hillary Clinton apparently lied to the FBI I think that that's probably true and she got away with it Mike Flynn lied to the FBI and now it looks like their pillar iing him is lying to the FBI ok of course not he committed a crime and if you committed a crime then he should pay the price for that crime but the idea that Michael Flynn was actually trying to cover up for something more nefarious is not for now here's where Trump really gets himself in trouble or at least we don't have the evidence that yet here's where Trump really gets himself in trouble so Trump tweets out this over the weekend he tweets quote I had to fire general Flynn because he lied to the vice president and the FBI he has pled guilty to those lies it is a shame because his action during the transition were lawful there was nothing to hide okay so he's basically saying what I'm saying here is that Flynn lied to the FBI but there was no underlying crime the problem here is that what the president is actually saying is that he fired Flynn knowing that Flynn lied to the FBI so this a lot a lot of people to suggest that this was obstruction of justice right the reason that it sounds like obstruction of justice is because James Comey if you recall had testified that President Trump told him to let Flynn go and then he apparently fired Flynn because he had lied to the FBI so the implication of this tweet is that Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI when he fired him not just lied to the vice president so if he knew that Flynn lied to the FBI and then he went to co me and told Comey then the head the FBI to let Flynn go a lot of people I'm left claiming that this is obstruction of justice it isn't I'll explain why legally but here is the here is the flashback of James Comey and the reason I keep saying his words is I took it as a direction right I mean it's the president United States with me alone saying I hope this I took it as this is what he wants me to do no I didn't I didn't obey that but that's the way I took it you may have taken it as a direction but that's not what he said correct that's what I said he said I hope those are exact words correct you don't know of anyone that's ever been charged for hoping something is that a fair statement I don't as I sit here thank you thank you right so a lot of people on the Left hang well you know what that is that right there that's obstruction of justice well Dianne Feinstein is saying this right Dianne Feinstein the senator from California she says this looks like obstruction of justice as you know I'm ranking on judiciary and the Judiciary Committee has an investigation going as well and it involves obstruction of justice and I think what we're beginning to see is the putting together of case of obstruction of justice I think we see this in the indictments the four indictments and pleas that have just taken place and some of the comments that are being made I see it in the hyper phonetic attitude of the White House the comments every day the continual tweets and I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of director Comey and it is my belief that that is directly because he did not agree to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation okay the problem here is that there is no clear-cut obstruction of justice even if he fired call me let's say worst case scenario he fired call me because he wanted call me to stop investigating Flynn there's no clear-cut investigation obstruction of justice because the president does have the power to fire the FBI director for any reason he sees fit yeah I've actually looked at the statutes and I'm gonna go through the statutes right sunette right now with you on obstruction of justice as to whether obstruction of justice actually took place not clear legally that obstruction of justice has taken place by the way the idea that trumps shut down the investigation is obviously untrue and special counsel is going forward from has the power to fire the special prosecutor Robert molar he is not in fact done any of that so before I get to whether this is obstruction of justice even if the Democrats were suspicions are confirmed first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at saucy so you know the news cycle moves so fast life is

that's what Stassi provides to you saucy saucy app and use that promo code Ben that's correct folks I did just use the phrase Netflix and chill okay so as far as obstruction of justice the the Democrats are basically claiming now that Trump fired James Comey in order to obstruct justice this doesn't wash for a couple of reasons one the special counsel has continued his investigation into Russian collusion and has found nothing collusion is not a crime and now let's look at the actual statutes an obstruction of justice so there are three separate federal laws that cover obstruction of justice there's 18 US Code 1503 this is called the Omnibus clause it covers quote roughly or by any threatening letter or communication influencing or impeding or endeavoring to influence obstruct or impede the due administration of justice but this Clause requires a pending judicial proceeding and there is no pending judicial proceeding because Flint had not been indicted yet now if Trump were to go to Muller now and say to him cut it out let Flynn go then that would actually be obstruction of justice but he doesn't have to do that he was pardoned Flint right which is not obstruction of justice because he's the president and that's within his purview there's 18 USC 1512 C this provision of law covers anyone who quote obstructs influences or impedes an official proceeding or attempts to do so it is not clear that an FBI investigation is actually an official proceeding and it's hard to prove intent in any case it's and by the way it's not enough to show intent to violate the subsection you have to take a substantial step toward the accomplishment of that goal so again there's no substantial step taken toward obstruction and finally there's 18 us code 1519 and this provision covers destroying evidence there are no accusations that President Trump destroyed evidence in any of this so is there obstruction of justice no she's wrong does Trump have the capacity to fire Comey for any reason the answer is yes Comey works for him so there's no obstruction he could fire call me does that mean that it's smart for the President of the United States to go out there and start saying that he knew that Flynn lied to the FBI and then he fired the FBI director no that is not smart of the President of the United States it gets him in all sorts of hot water and that's why the president's lawyer came forward and said I wrote that tweet it wasn't Trump the idea being that it doesn't establish Trump's knowledge that Flynn lied to the FBI if the lawyer wrote the tweet now what's interesting is when you watch the conflation of two separate narratives from the Democrats Dianne Feinstein I believe is a lawyer so she knows enough to know that you can't make charges of collusion without evidence or you shouldn't or than that the the Mike Flynn charges don't show that there is actual cheating in the election between Russia and the Trump campaign Joy Behar however is a moron and she doesn't know that so Joe by Joy Behar over at the view she completely misconstrues the report from Mike Flynn and you'll hear the crowd cheer as they think they finally got Trump oh breaking news ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Muller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians and the crowd goes wild for news that never happened because it never happened so we reported on Friday the Brian Ross had said this on ABC only one problem Brian Ross was wrong so let's let's get to Trump fighting back against all of this so Trump is not a guy who sits down when when he feels that there's a need to stand now the president is a counter puncher as the vice president says and the idea that the President of the United States is going to take a back seat to anyone on this stuff is not true so the president immediately goes out front and starts fighting this so he starts by slamming the FBI itself so he he goes on Twitter and he says report anti-trump FBI agent lead Clinton email probe now it all starts to make sense he's saying this is witch-hunt that the FBI was that that the Clinton probe was led by a bunch of biased people and that the people who are now going after him from the FBI are biased as well now it is certainly certainly the case that James Comey was biased in favor of Hillary Clinton there is no doubt whatsoever that she actually violated the law and he let her off the hook preemptively and it's not a surprise that an anti-trump FBI agent was was helping Hillary Clinton out the idea that the FBI is a non-political body is not true the FBI has always been somewhat of a political body that does not mean that local FBI agents aren't doing their jobs but Trump isn't wrong about this by the way it is it is important to question and ask this question on Fox it still has not been answered this FBI agent the story here is that there was an FBI agent who had texted some nasty things about Trump and Robert Muller fired him the question is how Robert Miller fella found out about it so if Robert Muller found out about it and fired him then Robert Muller is is not biased right that would be evidence that Robert Muller is trying to do the right thing if he found out about because the media reported on it and then he fired him then it might be that the Muller investigation is inherently biased I don't think Muller is necessarily biased against Trump I think that this is what special prosecutors do they dig and they dig and they dig in they dig until they find a crime and if they can't find a crime then they get a bunch of people in there to talk to the FBI and then they use that to create crimes and I'm not saying that Mike Flynn was entrapped Mike Flynn is a an intelligent guy should have been there with a lawyer you don't lie to the FBI but it is also true that the FBI likes to charge lying to the FBI even when there's no underlying crime so Trump slams the FBI and then continues along these lines he also tweets this Tainted know very dishonest FBI agents role in Clinton probe under review led Clinton email probe Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge so here's Trump going after the FBI now you know there is something dangerous about going after the entire institution of the FBI but to suggest that there is bias in the Hillary in the Hillary investigation I think is is understating the case as I said at the time the idea that Muller did not indict Hillary Clinton or at least recommend her indictment is is pretty astonishing okay so there is that then he went directly after James Comey so Comey why call me is still in the news is really beyond me I guess just because Comey the suggestion is the obstructed justice by firing Comey but Trump says I never asked coming to stop investigating Flynn just more fake news covering another Comey why so Comey is the one who testified to that Trump is now saying that he never told Comey to stop investigating Flynn the evidence on Trump's side on this is that Comey didn't actually stop investigating Flynn and even after Comey was fired the investigation into Flynn obviously didn't stop so it's possible that Trump said I wish that you would see your way clear to letting Flynn go he's not he's not a bad guy by the same token that doesn't really count is telling Flynn to stop investigated telling Comey to stop investigating Flynn I mean Trump had the capacity to make that stop and he didn't and then he continued along smacking Comey he said after years of call me with the phony is dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI its reputation is in tatters worst in history but fear not we will bring and bring it back to greatness so he's attacking the FBI so another institution under attack now Comey is not helping his case so Comey goes out himself and decides that it is worthwhile to tweet so now come B's on Twitter this is just what we need everyone on Twitter and James Comey tweets a bunch of pictures of people in FBI coats saying I want the people to know this truth the FBI is honest the FBI is strong and the FBI is and always will be independent me June 8th 2017 there is an account called ben shapiro quote I do retweet it but I don't actually quote myself okay I don't I'm not sure that I've ever actually quoted myself like on Twitter like that James Comey is you know Trump called him a grandstander and basically an attention whore James Comey is those things so Trump goes after Comey as well then Trump goes after the media he's not wrong to go after bias in the FBI he's not wrong after call me by the way and he's not wrong to go after the media so he starts slamming the media too particularly because of this retracted report from Brian Ross so let's start with the actual Brian Ross report so Brian Ross originally reported this about Mike Flynn and and president Trump he's prepared to testify we are told by a confident against President Trump against members of Trump family and others in the White House he's prepared to testify that President Trump as a candidate Donald Trump ordered him directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point as well we're told that Flynn made the decision to cooperate only in the last 24 hours that he is distraught about the decision but feels he's doing the right thing for his country that he was facing huge legal bills of more than a million dollars and that he said that finally he had to go ahead and do this for that reason he sucks to put his house on the market he is facing serious financial problems he so Ross has been in trouble a few other times for getting the story completely wrong here he got the story completely wrong it turns out that Flynn had not was not going to testify that candidate Trump told him to contact the Russians but that president-elect Trump had told him to contact the Russians that makes a huge difference president elect Trump telling him to contact the Russians is not a big deal it doesn't go to the question of whether the Trump campaign was working with the Russians in the first place so Brian Ross is forced to retract this here he is retracting this just over the weekend he was then suspended for a month forgetting this report wrong and David the clarification tonight on something one of Flynn's confidants told us and we reported earlier today he said the president asked Flynn to contact Russia during the campaign he's now clarifying that saying according to Flynn candidate Trump asked him during the campaign to find ways to repair relations with Russia and other hotspots and then after the election the president-elect asked him to told him to contact Russia on issues including working together to fight Isis David before and after in the meantime Brian we do have a statement from Michael Flint tonight he said I accept full responsibility for my actions that's right and the Flint's confidence has extremely angry at the White House tonight that he was going broke with crippling legal fees finally Trump's lets his Trump goes after Brian Ross and the media and we'll get to that in just one second so Trump is lashing out at everyone in part I think justifiably in part he's making things worse for himself when he lashes out this way it makes him look like he has something to hide even though he doesn't I've said from the very beginning from the literally the outside of this that when he fired Comey it seems to me that the best possible explanation for what Trump does is incompetence not malice that usually it's about President Trump being angry at something that's going on firing somebody not about him just deciding that he wants to cover up some sort of nefarious crime I'll get to all that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at USC CA

Trump Slams Brian Rossi goes after him here - he's not wrong to slam Brian Ross okay he's right Brian Ross was wrong here again I'm not sure it's worth the president getting his hands dirty because when the president does this it gives off an air of desperation that I don't think is actually warranted here he says people who lost money when stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of ABC News he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this reporting has caused many millions of dollars I don't really think he wants to go here the fact is the President of the United States has momentarily tanked various stocks over his presidency by naming companies and bashing them if they can sue over Trump doing that then you know they can also sue over Brian Ross I suppose Trump continues along these lines and he says Trump goes after the media he goes after Brian Ross not a shock there and then finally he hits the Justice Department he's still angry at his own Justice Department for not going after Hillary Clinton and really he's mad at Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department for not protecting him from what he feels is a witch hunt and here's what he tweeted many people in our country are asking what the Justice Department justice in scare quotes is going to do about the fact that totally crooked Hillary after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted an acid-washed 33,000 emails no justice and then he tweeted along these lines again he went after his own goj so general Flynn lies to the FBI his life is destroyed crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many times and nothing happens to her rigged system or just a double standard again I don't think he's wrong on all this I just think that the louder Trump gets the more it looks as though he has something to hide and that's a problem for him the best thing he could do right now is hey listen the investigation should go forward I didn't lie Mike Flynn mighta lied to the FBI but it's about an underlying crime that doesn't exist and then maybe down the road when all this when all that comes out is that it's a bunch of lied to the FBI charges with no underlying crime he can always do the Scooter Libby just commute everybody sentence to me that seems like the best possible solution but what's happening here is I think Trump is getting so upset about this that now he's thinking about firing Robert Muller the special counsel once you fire the special counsel then all hell breaks loose because people are going to assume rightly or wrongly that you really do have something to hide so whoever is around president Trump should be encouraging him today not to fire Muller but to be encouraging Mike Flynn that he's probably never gonna serve a day in jail for lying to the FBI about something for which there's no underlying crime Chris ruddy who's a friend to President Trump says that Muller is an existential threat to the Trump presidency at this point that's true in the sense that the more of this builds up the more Democrats might try to impeach him but let me put it this way if the Democrats tried to impeach Trump over Mike Flynn lying to the FBI over no underlying crime I would oppose the impeachment I think so would most Americans here's Chris ruddy those saying that Trump is feeling really threatened you know at the end of the day my view is that Robert Muller poses an existential threat to the Trump presidency he's gotten four major two convictions two plea agreements lightning speed okay I don't think that he posed an existential threat to the Trump presidency unless you think that Trump actually has something to hide if Trump does have something to hide then it was Trump that posed in existential threat to the Trump presidency not Muller that said this does not look like this is a in a political investigation by any stretch of the imagination it looks like an investigation designed to elicit charges of lie to the FBI that it's not designed to elicit actual underlying crimes we were told this investigation was all about collusion with the Russians has there been any evidence of that hasn't my wonders I did anyone for any of that not that I can really see anywhere here I mean George papadopolis would be the closest thing to it and even that is is unclear as far as the actual collusion okay so I have a lot more to talk about I don't talk about tax reform I want to talk about and I want to talk about a big Supreme Court case that is coming up tomorrow we still have to do our Federalist paper because it is a Monday so we have not done our assignment yeah so lots to

leave us a review as well we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so a lot else to get to president Trump has endorsed Wright more I'm gonna save that for things that I hate but first I want to get to tax reform passing so all of this flin news has swamped what is the biggest accomplishment so far of the Trump presidency outside of the Gorsuch pick for the Supreme Court and that is the passage of tax reform in the Senate I've discussed sort of the merits of the tax bill before I think it is a meritorious bill I think there's a lot that is good to it the Democrats are suggesting that it is just the worst thing ever Patton Oswalt the insufferable comedian who was also the voice of the rat Remy in in ratatouille he tweeted out is there any going back after this tax bill scam to America does it matter now if Trump is impeached there's no America now not the one we knew sorry feeling real despair this morning wait like we cut I get to keep more of my own money and that ends America that's like the end of it like we're done dunzo turn out the lights finished finito benito mussolini like what why didn't the what in the world it's okay so after the obamacare decision came down from the Supreme Court I said that America had been fundamentally changed the reason I said that is because a basic principle of Americanism had been ripped away that principle was the government cannot force you to buy things right they until then the idea the government could force you to buy an entirely optional products with no externalities on anyone else this is a brand new concept and that fundamentally changed things it violated my liberty it installed a new tent pole for tyranny in the United States I can force you to not buy anything I want and I can force you to buy anything I want that's full-on control of my life Patton Oswalt however thinks that if I get to keep more of my own money that this is the end of America there's no America now now listen you cannot like the process by how this bill was passed I'm not real fond of it it was crammed through it was it was done with handwritten notes in the in the margins by the way that's not as rare as it seems they've been a bunch of Congress people who've done that before that odd frank bill had handwritten notes in the margins all of that said it was rushed through without proper evaluation or debate that was done because senators didn't want blowback but is it it's a pretty typical Republican bill I mean it's not like there's anything groundbreaking here the biggest problem with the bill is that is that it doesn't it doesn't cut expend which is really what I wish Republicans would focus on right now Republicans inflate the deficit by cutting taxes even though the tax revenues in the long run grow it may not make up for the tax revenues that are lost in the short run meaning the government takes in the less money Democrats blow out the budget by increasing spending even if they raise taxes I don't think Republicans shouldn't lower taxes I just think they need to pair that with some actual cuts which I highly doubt they will do and so we continue to kick the can down the road on our debt but the idea that is this is the end of America it demonstrates that for the left they've truly believed I mean they really do believe that it is the government's job to control your life and anything the government doesn't do to control your life is bad for America the more the government does to control your life the better it is for America I'll show you the proof so Larry Summers former president of Harvard former Clinton Treasury secretary and he predicted 10,000 people would die per year because of tax reform today on CNBC there's pretty clear evidence looking across different states and looking when health insurance has been phased in and out when people lose health insurance they're less likely to get preventive care they're more likely to defer health care they need and ultimately they're more likely to die and it's very hard to quantify precisely my piece explains why an estimate that thousands will die as a consequence of this bill is actually a very conservative estimate because the reason he says that is because the bill also gets rid of the individual mandate it doesn't force you to buy health insurance but the idea here is that if the government doesn't force you to buy health insurance and you opted not to that is the same as the government killing you that's in the same okay that means that the government didn't force me this morning to get up and wrap myself in bubble wrap the government didn't get wake me this morning and say you have to eat healthy today that means the government is killing me I'm not telling me what to do the government is killing me this is precisely the reverse of the notions of American liberty enshrined in the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence but it goes further than this there are a bunch of commentators who are out there saying that it is irreligious all these religious Christians who back the tax reform bill the hell is wrong with these people so there's guy named Jonathan Martin and James Martin rather who is a who is a Jesuit priest and he tweeted this out the US will soon face the consequences of a tax bill that takes money from the poor to give to the rich this is false the money that the bill does not take from the poor to give to the rich it allows rich people to keep their own money it allows poor people to keep their own money says those who voted for it will face consequences later when they are judged in hell done tom tom says do you think Jesus is worried about being judged on Holi care for the poor don't apply think again and then he brings the hammer boom okay and he's not the only person who's speaking religious sophistry there's a female rabbi named Daniel Bruton burg and she tweeted something out like if the Bible is so against systemic solutions to poverty why is a Jubilee year declare that releases people from debt to alleviate intergenerational poverty what is Luckett shittaka pea and moss era if not tax is meant to create a safety net for those in need so in a second I'm gonna go through actually what the Bible says about taxes but I first want to point something out the Bible never says that it's the government's job to provide for the poor it says that it is your job to provide for the poor this is why religious people give significantly more charity than religious people it's why conservatives give a lot more personal charity than non conservative people so all the people who are generous with everybody else's money by using the government as a cram down mechanism for welfare all those people are happy to use my money in the ways they see fit but they are not willing to actually dip into their own pocket and make it happen the reason that whether you talk about Jesus we're talking about the Old Testament all of the religious sources in judeo-christian history have been talking not about what the state should do but about what you should do how you have a religious obligation to help out the poor and the needy and the widow and the orphan and now I'm going to actually go through the Bible so they're a bunch of people who have complained before about well you know you're a religious person Ben you wear a yarmulke and yet there are a bunch of things in the Bible to talk about taking care of the poor okay now I'm gonna go through that I'm going to show you what sort of taxes the Bible is talking about to take care of the poor okay number one the Bible talks about tax is explicitly twice I'm talking here about the the Tanakh the the Old Testament it talks that you use the hebrew word which is mas que mas means tax in in hebrew he it only uses it twice in the entirety of the of the Torah in the prophets and in the writings okay uses it with regard to the King Rehoboam right who is Solomon's son Solomon raised taxes and then his son raised taxes and the actual effect of that is that the Kingdom Israel split in two because taxes were too high talks about that a little bit later in the in the profits and then ah hush vero shahe swear us in in the poram story raise taxes at the end of the story demonstrating his mastery over the far-flung domains neither in in neither context are the taxes seen as something good the talmud especially rips into the tax of OshKosh B'gosh okay now let's talk about other biblical forms of tax first there's tithing again we talked about tithing she's talked specifically it's talking about something in Hebrew that's called master Shanee now I know I don't wanna get too abstruse here with the biblical teaching but since I actually do read the Bible in the original Hebrew I'm gonna use some Hebrew terms here mas'r Shanee is tithing that's the tithing that we always talk about for the poor but here's what the Bible actually says about that in Deuteronomy okay the four the original there's actually two sets of tithing in the Torah there's moss air and there's master SHANY master literally means one-tenth so mass air and mass are SHANY mass air is for the Levites master Shanee is for the poor and the orphans in the widow's okay it only applies in the third and sixth years of the sabbatical cycle and is ten percent of produce okay so that's a 10% tax every third and sixth year for the widow and the orphan okay then there's something called chica ha that's when you forget a sheaf in the field is also in Deuteronomy you're supposed to leave it for the widow and orphan so you're walking around and you leave one or two sheets for the widow and orphan okay that's pretty de minimis okay then there is a lekha and pea these are referenced in Leviticus 19 lek it is referring to ears of corn that you forget on the ground same sort of thing you're gleaning your crop and you forget an ear of corn on the ground leave it there for the poor and then there is pea which refers to leaving a corner of your field for the poor and the widow right the minimum amount for pea is one sixtieth of your field so at best we are talking about a biblically mandated 11.7% of your produce every third and sixth year okay that's what the Bible says it's hard to talk about how the Bible is saying well you have to give a hundred percent of your everything to charity it's nonsense in fact in Judaism once you hit a certain once you got I believe it's 20% of your of your money to charity you're supposed to think seriously about whether to get more than that because you're actually undercutting your own ability to take care of your family Democrats are talking about maintaining tax rates of above 50% okay so don't talk to me about what the Bible says about taxes okay then they talk about to further biblical provisions there's shemitah which is the sabbatical year every seventh year you leave the land fallow the idea there was that the land is going to recover and then there's yobbo yo've oh is every fiftieth year all of the land sales that have been made in the prior 50 years revert back to their original owner both of these were supposed to get rid of loans one of the problems that happen is that it turns out people stopped giving loans at all so what did the rabbi's do the Talmud says that they designed something called a prose boule which was a basic legal war legal workaround so you could continue to lend his lending ground to a halt also the purpose of having all the land revert back to its original owners in the fiftieth year was not to create some sort of socialist system where he can't sell land or aggregate wealth the purpose was they didn't want tribal land moving from one tribe to another Yeovil does not apply the Jubilee year does not apply when all the tribes don't live in Israel and aren't separated by tribe okay so there is your basic biblical breakdown I know that's more specific than most people would want but the idea that the Bible mandates that you are supposed to give enormous amounts of charity via government compulsion is just not true it's not true in the slightest okay other big story today final big story then we'll get to some things I like things I hate and the and the and the Federalist Papers the other big stories that tomorrow there's a big case at the Supreme Court it's called a masterpiece cake shop case so we've talked about this before the masterpiece cake shop case is a seminal one for both religious liberty and freedom of association basically there's a guy named Jack Phillips jack is a baker in Colorado he makes he decorates cakes he will make a cake for any one gay couple straight couple green couple doesn't matter he'll make a cake even for your gay wedding what he won't do is decorate it in particular styles he's not gonna use his artistic skill in order to in order to make a wedding cake for a gay wedding so he's not going to decorate a cake that says happy gay wedding John and Bob right he's not gonna actually take one of those cake toppers with two dudes and stick it on top of the cake that's something that Jack is not gonna do so the leftist at the Colorado Civil Rights Commission said the jack has to be forced to violate his own religious beliefs as a result of their own ruling he lost 40 percent of his business more than half of his employees all by about all for abiding by his biblical beliefs the left says the government should be able to force Jack to decorate the cake for the gay couple for their wedding okay this is vert this is viscerally anti religion it's also anti freedom of association and Sarah Jones is a leftist columnist in The New Republic here's what she here's what she says and I think this is right she says what Phillips wants is for the law to wait his personal beliefs about a person's intrinsic ident above that person's right to access a business I guess that's fair what Phillips wants is for his personal beliefs to be able to be invoked in his business dealings as we all would like right I don't think that if you're a leftist radio host you should be forced to have me on your show I don't think that if you're a leftist speech writer you should be forced to work for President Trump and use your artistry to that effect I don't think that if you're a gay business owner you should be forced to bake me a cake that says on it Leviticus 18:22 I don't think you need to do any of those things because I'm for freedom freedom only exists in the spaces where we acknowledge that we have no right to someone else's labor or approval tyranny grows when we refuse to approve those spaces this is about tyranny it's not even about religion it's about do you have the freedom to act in ways you see fit even if others don't like it and even if it means that others can't take advantage of your services the answer is was and always will be constitutionally yes that is why I believe fully that you are able to turn away whomever you want from your business and yes that includes for bad people right racist can turn away people what anti-semites can turn away Jews you know it'll happen I'll walk across the street races can turn away black people you know it'll happen they'll walk across the street and those races will go bankrupt as I've said in a thousand speeches at this point the fact is the capitalism doesn't care about color it doesn't care about Creed all the cares about is cash and if you're turning away a vast bevy of clientele you're undermining your own business okay time for things I like things I hate and then we'll go through a federalist paper really quickly so things I like so over the weekend I had a chance to read some Elmore Leonard never actually read his stuff I had watched a little bit of the series justified if you watch that series it's based on a short story called fire in the hole and Elmore Leonard is a crime writer he's really quite good I really enjoy his writing he's very straightforward he's not deliberately obscure so I've read a couple of really good crime writers in the past a couple of weeks Don Winslow's who's early stuff I read one of his books that I didn't like very much though the legend the life and death of bobbies he wasn't very good but his book on the cartel was great and fire in the hole there's another very very good book of short crime stories there's a reason that Elmore Leonard's best-selling author check it out Elmore Leonard fire in the hole it's kind of its kind of westerns it's basically westerns and they're pretty great okay time for some things that I hate all right so the thing that I hate today is that the president has endorsed the Roy Moore the president came out and tweeted that he supported Moore and that you should support Roy Moore - he then called up Roy Moore personally and lent his support has anything changed from when these allegations were originally made about Roy Moore for child molestation the answer is no nothing has changed it is certainly possible the President of the United States could go around saying don't vote Doug Jones right don't vote Doug Jones you want to vote right in whatever you want to vote for Roy Moore all right but don't vote Doug Jones you could have said that right and just made it into a lesser of two evils choice by overtly endorsing Roy Moore it is very difficult to escape the public perception that your pooh-poohing the actual child molestation allegations now Democrats have no leg to stand on here since they're gonna let Al Franken sit in the Senate after we have pictures of him trying to grow up a woman's breasts while she's sleeping Democrats don't have much of a leg to stand on so long as John Conyers is in Congress so long as Bill Clinton is still an honored member of their society that said is this good for the country no it's not good for the country when you're gonna have an alleged child molester sitting in the Senate he's probably gonna win and I think that he'll be seated I think that the idea that the Senate is going to not seat him is is foolish I think now a novel seat him now that Al Franken is staying he'll be seated and you see that Mitch McConnell is making those moves to here's Mitch McConnell in Alabama saying we'll let the people of Alabama decide whether he ought to be seated well I think we're gonna let the people of Alabama decide a week from Tuesday who they want to send to the Senate and it will address the matter appropriately I've already said in the past that I thought this was a matter that would have to be considered by the committee ultimately would be up to them to make that decision and they'll make it depending upon whether a judge Maury ends up coming to the Senate do you believe the judge more should be in the Senate I don't let the people of Alabama make the call to move on to move by McConnell in the wrong direction so we've seen all these politicians basically fussing over these allegations first you had Nancy Pelosi defending John Conyers now you have Mitch McConnell basically defending Roy Moore everything is getting worse and worse on this score because no one is willing to take a moral stand and take a temporary loss you do wonder you know back in 1993 I think it was David Duke ran for Senate in Louisiana and the Republicans said we would rather you vote for the Democrat than David Duke you do wonder today if the Republican Party would do that or if it Emma party would do that if the case were reversed we may be so partisan that we're beyond saving here okay so quick correction so last week even during my Corrections I screwed up a correction so now I'm going to correct another thing as I try to make clear folks I'm frying that when I make a mistake at least I try to fix it okay so Theresa May I said was selected on the basis of her of her being Pro brexit that is not true she didn't actually I have a position on the referendum she had been I guess my you know sort of anti brexit but then when she came in and she pledged that she was going to enforce brexit I had a guy named Richard who wrote to me and he says as Home Secretary Theresa May took the position of the UK government and endorsed remain but what made her position sufficiently ambiguous to get herself selected by both sides of the Conservative Party was that the pot was the fact she didn't take an active part in campaigning for remain okay I hope I have corrected this to everyone's satisfaction now okay now I'm gonna go briefly from Federalist Papers from Federalist number six so we're gradually making our way through the Federalist Papers the Federalist Papers are very long there are 85 of them we are now from number six we are gradually making our way Federalist the first five Federalist Papers or at least three of those five we're basically devoted to why America should be one country now we're going to talk about the possible conflicts between the states and why you need a stronger centralized government than the Articles of Confederation could provide in order prevent conflict between the states so what's really fascinating in this one is Alexander Hamilton writes if Hamilton is of the three guys writing the best writer Hamilton's a very lucid and powerful writer and Hamilton makes the case against the idea that the states will be at peace without a strong central government there are much people who said why do we need a strong central government all the states will get along well in doing so he actually debunked a couple of very popular twentieth and twenty-first century notions the idea of democratic peace theory the democratic countries don't fight each other and the idea that countries that do commerce don't fight each other so he debunked both of these which is really interesting because I agree with Hamilton he says the genius of Republic's say they say his opponents is Pacific meaning that they are peaceful the spirit of Commerce has a tendency to soften the manners of men and to extinguish those inflammable humors which have so often kindled into Wars commercial republics like ours will never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other meaning this is this is what they've often called the McDonald's arches theory of diplomacy that countries that have been donald's and free Commerce are less likely to go to war with one he says they will be governed by mutual interest will cultivate a spirit of mutual Amity and Concord but then he says have Republic's in practice been less addicted to war than monarchies are not the former administered by men as well as the latter the founders are constantly focusing in on human frailty human weakness and human flaw and that's why the constitution is such a grand document Isis are there not aversions predilections rival ships desires of unjust acquisitions that affect nations as well as kings in other words democracy is not a cure-all for war which is obviously true we've seen democracies go to war with one another Hitler was an elected official and the Soviet Union originally was a popular movement it was a minority popular movement but it was popular most as I've said before virtually all fascist nations in the West started off under democratic auspices before power was either seized or democratic means were used to elevate a bad guy to power Sparta Athens Rome Carthage were all Republic's as Hamilton two of them Athens in Carthage of the commercial kind yet were they as often engaged in Wars offensive and defensive as the neighboring monarchies at the same times meaning they being a commercial republic is not going to save you and then he says from this summary of what has taken place in other countries whose situations have born the nearest resemblance to our own what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present Confederacy in a state of separation in other words if we don't have a strong centralized government the states are gonna be fighting each other in five seconds have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape he says there's always gonna be conflict that's why we need to band together against all outsiders instead of banding together against each other he says it's time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age I love the realism and to adopt as a practical maximum for the direction of our political conduct that we as well as the inhabitants of the globe are yet remote from the happy Empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue and this is so different from how the left thinks that human beings are capable of something that's why we have to have a world government this is why if every man were left to imagine in John Lennon's style everything would be all better the founders were ultimate realists and that's why their words are still important because well we may have different notions of how government ought to work they were more correct than we because our notions of human nature are worse than theirs okay so now we we have reach the end of today's show there will be a lot more to discuss tomorrow as always I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is
