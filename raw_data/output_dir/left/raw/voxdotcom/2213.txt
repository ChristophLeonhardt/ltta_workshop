00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,409
You may have heard that Mercury is retrograde
again.

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:08,010
But if you try to find out what that means,
search results are dominated by astrologers

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,870
who believe Mercury can make you spill coffee
on your favorite shirt or cause your car to break down.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,349
But if you set aside all those creative interpretations,
there’s actually a real astronomical phenomenon

5
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:20,229
underneath.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,199
So let’s start with the basic layout of
our solar system.

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,189
The planets closest to the sun move faster
and the outer planets move slower, but they

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,980
all go in the same direction.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,850
“Apparent retrograde motion” is when planets
appear to temporarily change the direction

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,940
of their orbit.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,870
They don’t change direction, it just looks
that way from Earth.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,710
It’s an illusion that unfolds over a matter
of weeks or months.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,219
In this image, Mars was photographed every
5-7 days between October 2011 and July 2012.

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,239
Once all the photos were combined by aligning
the stars in the background, it appears as

15
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,950
though Mars looped back on itself before continuing
on its orbit.

16
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,950
A retrograde illusion happens when we lap
an outer planet, like we do with Mars every

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,560
2 years, or when an inner planet laps Earth,
like Mercury does every 4 months or so.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,100
But for both Mercury and Venus, the illusion
is hard to actually capture since they’re

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,500
located on Earth’s day side, not our night
side.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,330
When those planets are visible, it’s only right
around sunset and sunrise.

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,910
But assuming you could see it, here’s a
diagram of how the Mercury retrograde illusion

22
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,090
would work.

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,229
This line shows our view of Mercury against
the background stars.

24
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:38,909
As Mercury passes us by, our line of sight
shifts so that for about 3 weeks Mercury will

25
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,820
appear to loop back on itself when viewed
from Earth.

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,140
It’s simply a function of two objects orbiting
in the same direction at different speeds.

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,759
If you stood on Mercury, you would see Earth
make an apparent loop too.

28
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,620
I wanted to recreate this illusion on a tabletop
so I stuck a post-it note to the wall in the

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,159
background to represent the fixed stars.

30
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,130
I grabbed a ball of play-doh to be Mercury and my phone
camera is Earth. I took 10 photos of them

31
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,080
orbiting in the same direction with Mercury
passing by Earth.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,390
If you simply view the images in sequence,
you don’t really see the loop, but remember,

33
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,220
the illusion is relative to the background
of fixed stars.

34
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,770
So once you line up the images so that that
post-it note star is fixed, the retrograde

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,200
loop appears.

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,360
Here’s another visualization of the retrograde
loop of Mars as Earth passes it.

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,420
The bottom part shows the positions of the
planets and the top is the corresponding view

38
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,030
of Mars from Earth.

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,270
The key is to always remember that Earth is
moving too.

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,670
So retrograde motion was baffling to early
astronomers who thought that Earth was stationary

41
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,860
and at the center of the solar system.

42
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,840
In the 2nd century, Ptolemy devised a complicated
system of loops and orbits within orbits to

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,350
account for the apparent retrograde motion
of planets.

44
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,770
That model was accepted for 1500 years because
it seemed to fit the observations, even though

45
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,150
it was completely wrong.

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,540
Once Copernicus showed that all the planets,
including Earth, move around the sun, then

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,450
then retrograde motion was easily explained as
an illusion.

48
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,250
So if there’s any life lessons to learn
from Mercury retrograde,

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:24,010
it’s that we may be vulnerable to illusions
when we think everything revolves around us.

50
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,740
It's really frustrating how misleading the scale is on every illustration of the solar system

51
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,600
So I feel compelled to point out that the real distance between Earth and Mercury,

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:00:00,000
when those planets are closest together, is more than 6,000 times the diameter of Earth.
