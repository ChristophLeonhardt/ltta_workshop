who in blue hell would conflate climate change with female genital mutilation well Justin Trudeau that's who buckle up folks you're not gonna believe this whopper well Justin Trudeau continues to embarrass Canada on the world stage most recently it was at Yankee Stadium when he addressed 10,000 graduates of New York University there were gaffes galore in this Winston ducing speech but surely the biggest jaw-dropper had to be Justin conflating climate change with female genital mutilation here's what he said quote now let me be very clear this is not an endorsement of moral relevant ISM or a declaration that all points of view are valid female genital mutilation is wrong no matter how many generations have practiced it anthropogenic climate change is real no matter how much some folks want to deny it end quote part of me folks give me a few seconds here to process this pithy prose because my brain is currently spinning on its axis you know if I were a pinball machine I think the tilt side would be illuminated right now okay I think I'm all right now for starters FGM is a crime in Canada as it is in so many other countries but a contrarian opinion to manmade climate change is not a crime here or anywhere else at least not yet in fact in a recent abacus data poll more than 20% of Canadians surveyed said they didn't believe in manmade climate change as opposed to climate changing due to natural circumstances so with man-made climate change denial equated with FGM are we to assume that Trudeau if given his druthers would like to see more than one-fifth of the population incarcerated for expressing a politically incorrect opinion on climate change gee there's your new federal make-work project a building concentration camps for the millions of Canadian deniers according to the Gospel of Al Gore oh speaking of gospel when exactly did Justin Trudeau have has come to Jesus moment regarding FGM is this not the same man who when in opposition some five years ago voiced his disgust over the language contained in the Conservatives citizenship guide you remember that how Justin had a conniption when the Conservatives used the word barbarism in Canada citizenship guide to describe quote cultural practices that tolerate spousal abuse honor killings female genital mutilation forced marriage or other gender-based violence end quote yeah Justin was actually offended with the Conservatives calling barbarism barbarism Justin's comments are a disgrace equally disgraceful is his inability to distinguish the difference between condemning and illegal mutilation practice driven by misogyny versus espousing an opinion about the climate that is politically incorrect in certain circles also how's this to cap off a triple play of disgrace the fact that there's been almost no mainstream media coverage about this particular element of Justin's Yankee Stadium speech I guess they just didn't want to rain on his parade as our vacuous p.m. received yet another honorary degree for doing nothing but playing the role of a buffoon for the rebel media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks do we have a super event plan for Saturday June the 2nd in Toronto it's our second annual rebel live we have Katie Hopkins Sheila Gunn read the big bossman Israel event John card ello so many others go to the rebel live.com get your tickets today don't you dare miss it you
