of the is 31 latest tweets three of them mentioned tax cuts and by the way only to acknowledge that it passed the committee or to start tying the tax cuts to the good economic news 7 tweets talked about how great the economy is doing once we mentioned the NFL 3 mentioned Melania Christmas or Melania and Christmas two of them mentioned Matt Lauer almost as many tweets mentioned Matt Lauer as his legislative agenda 3 showed videos of Muslims doing terrible things that's the same number as talking about tax cuts 3 talked about fake news one suggested the Joe Scarborough murdered a staffer one of them told his followers to look into NBC chairman Andy Lacs past why is Trump tweeting about these things it's because he's a prestidigitator if you don't know that word that's not like Amanda's name breasted Giacomo's prestidigitator it's a word for people of quick fingers like a magician magic where it's a slate of hand that is prestidigitation look over here look at look over there what's that and then when we're looking at that thing something else is happening over here so of all these tweets why is he talking about each of these the economy is obvious he's trying to try this try the strong economy to his tax plan he talks about how great the economy is doing how great the economy is doing he's building up his credibility on the economy then he's saying we need this new economic agenda this new economic legislation why Matt Lauer Matt Lauer's the biggest news of the day he has been fired for apparent sexual assault in Rio de Janeiro but I've apparently rampant womanizing sexual harassment at NBC but he doesn't just leave it in Matt Lauer he doesn't just look it would be great to revel in Matt Lauer going down that guy is a jerk he's a left-wing hack he was a jerk to President Bush when he would interview him but he's not doing that Trump isn't just leaving it in schadenfreude he's tying it to Joe Scarborough why because he's trying to discredit the left wing attack daughter media he's trying to paint with a much broader brush that's why he's going after NBC chairman Andy lack now why is he tweeting about the NFL the NFL is a culture culture point with that is extremely popular for Donald Trump he has broad agreement across the country on this his approval rating is doing a lot better than the NFL's approval rating people are cutting cable because of the shenanigans and doing activism they see every night at the NFL and why the Christmas tweets well they they preview the war on Christmas theme which we're already beginning to see but I promise you were gonna see more of it this month why the Muslim videos the Muslim videos I think tell a lot of the story he was retweeting videos of Muslims doing awful things attacking people and beheading a statue of the Virgin Mary and they were all posted by Jada Frandsen she's the deputy leader of Britain first which is a right-wing group and this woman who is he doesn't follow her on Twitter right he only follows 45 people on Twitter why tweet her this is a woman who was found guilty of a hate crime so the left is freaking out about this they say he's retweeting far-right criminals hate criminals bigots whatever what was her hate crime a simple Google search will tell you her hate crime was saying that Islam oppresses women that was the crime because they don't have the First Amendment over there and in the UK they don't have freedom of speech you can be convicted of a hate crime for just saying something which is obviously true obviously Sharia law isn't good for women a rule that says that women need to wear burlap sacks over them in Middle Eastern heat that can't possibly be good for women any concept we have on the west of women's rights does not apply now free speech though and PC these aren't just random issues they're central issues to Donald Trump's popularity and and this is where the claim breaks down why the the never Trump right and his opponents on the left they say he's just crazy he's just tweeting whatever there's no rhyme or reason to it he's a madman with his finger on the nuclear codes and the other finger on Twitter there's no evidence that Donald Trump hates Muslim people there's no evidence in the four decades that we've known about Donald Trump we we've never seen these allegations of bigotry before it clearly it has to serve a strategic purpose or we're suggesting that he just became a bigot overnight that he just became in his Lama folk overnight or something and he just so happened to pick a woman that ties in directly with his auntie PC Pro free speech agenda it doesn't work at a certain point either the guy just gets lucky and lucky and lucky and he's absurd lucky at multiple things at one time for 40 years or he doesn't just have air blowing between his ears he doesn't just have nothing going on in his head he has some strategic thought and a good gut that tells him had a had a enacted tactically so what is he not tweeting about this is the actual story I'm perfectly willing to talk about it because it's a great wing for the Republicans and for conservatives and because the left-wing media doesn't watch my show so I don't think I'm telling any tales out of school or pulling the veil up on this he isn't talking about tax reform but what was he doing yesterday Trump spent most of yesterday on Capitol Hill bullying Republican senators into voting for the GOP tax reform in the Budget Committee according to a Senate source for the hill Trump went after Ron Johnson by name quote this is in the hill he told him to stop blocking it and to work out his concerns with the rest of the conference he told him he would have a chance to offer amendments and he should stop being an impediment Trump also leaned on bob corker and James Lankford both of whom are Republicans that threatened to vote against the bill in committee Senate GOP Whip John Corr and said it was Trump strong-arming that gave the bill quote a shot of adrenaline it gave this bill that everyone has been predicting on both sides of the aisle it's going nowhere it's gonna die in committee not so gave it some momentum last month Trump also met with the entire Senate GOP caucus to get them on the same page on tax reform
