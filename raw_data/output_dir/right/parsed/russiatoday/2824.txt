now the Jewish community in France says
its facing increased levels of violence
and some fear the situation could get
worse
- after Trump's recognition of Jerusalem
as the capital of Israel
Charlotte Dubinsky has the story
seine-saint-denis used to be a heart of
the Jewish community in France but it's
a heart that's no longer beating French
Jews are fleeing the Paris suburbs to
escape a rise in anti-semitism Gigi
I was viciously attacked with a machete
by an individual because I'm Jewish
every day we are attacked they enjoy it
these radical Islamist stuck a knife in
my chest I'm very scared for my family
and myself I'm scared of going outside
and showing my face I'm forced to wear a
camp everyday to hide my keeper not all
of these attacks made the headlines and
according to one Jewish organization
they're just the tip of the iceberg
every day so you have people that hurt
every day the people that insulted we
can't be helped by words and we don't
mind but when we are hurt by a knife by
a gun you can't be I don't mind
many families have decided to quit
France altogether Jews started leaving
the country in record numbers back in
2015 following a terror attack on a
kosher supermarket in Paris
in 2015 almost 8,000 Jews left France in
2016 another 5,000 fled and over the
last decade more than 40,000 have packed
their bags that's almost 10 percent of
the Jewish population in France in few
decades there would be no Jew in France
and there is also a problem in Europe
there are almost no Jew know they're all
living so it's terrible what I will say
but I say that Europe is continuing by
peace what Italy has done by war
last month Frances Prime Minister
acknowledged the scale of the problem in
our country anti-semitism is alive it is
not new it is ancient it is not
superficial it is well rooted and it is
alive and it hides always behind new
masks attempts to justify itself through
diverse reasons that statement just came
a few days after Donald Trump made the
explosive decision to recognize
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel a
decision triggering anti-israel protests
across Europe and laying the ground for
more anti-semitic attacks
