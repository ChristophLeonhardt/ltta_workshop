00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:41,779
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

739
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,983
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 

740
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,185
AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY IN 

741
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,953
2 1/2 YEARS FOR THE NEXT 

742
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,387
CAMPAIGN? 

743
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:54,492
IT'S CALLED KEEP AMERICA GREAT, 

744
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,194
EXCLAMATION POINT! 

745
00:29:56,194 --> 00:30:04,802
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 

746
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,870
WE'VE GAINED $7 TRILLION IN 

747
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,475
VALUE, TRILLION WITH A "T." 

748
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,244
I HAVE WEALTHY FRIENDS LIKE 

749
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,779
HAROLD HAMM, THEY DON'T EVEN 

750
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,447
KNOW WHAT A TRILLION 

751
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,081
REPRESENTS. 

752
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:21,819
I SAY, HAROLD, HOW MANY BILLION 

753
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:22,753
ARE IN A TRILLION? 

754
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,021
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT HAROLD 

755
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:27,592
COULD ANSWER THAT. 

756
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,327
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'VE 

757
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:34,532
GAINED TREMENDOUS WORTH, 

758
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,767
ECONOMIC WORTH. 

759
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,568
AND OTHER WORTH. 

760
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,408
MORE IMPORTANT WORTH. 

761
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,475
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN, WE ARE 

762
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,309
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 

763
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,577
WE ARE MAKING GREAT TRADE 

764
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:52,216
DEALS. 

765
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:56,888
$7TRILLION, THINK OF THAT -- 

766
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,389
THINK OF WHAT THAT IS AND 

767
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,624
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS AND 

768
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,661
WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG WITH 

769
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,696
CHINA. 

770
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,464
AND WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG 

771
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,732
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH 

772
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,000
HAS BARRIERS FROM OUR FARMERS 

773
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,001
AND PEOPLE, SELLING PRODUCT 

774
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,935
INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

775
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:11,803
LAST YEAR, WITH THE EUROPEAN 

776
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,171
UNION, AND WE LOVE THE EUROPEAN 

777
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,605
UNION AND WE LOVE THE COUNTRIES 

778
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:23,614
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION -- BUT 

779
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:24,816
THE EUROPEAN UNION OF COURSE 

780
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,283
WAS SET UP TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 

781
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:27,218
THE UNITED STATES. 

782
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,586
TO ATTACK OUR PIGGY BANK, 

783
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:28,819
RIGHT? 

784
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,021
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE CAN'T LET 

785
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:30,388
THAT HAPPEN. 

786
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,388
LAST YEAR WITH THE EUROPEAN 

787
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:32,423
UNION WE LOST $151 BILLION ON 

788
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,191
TRADE. 

789
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,995
WE HAD A TRADE DEFICIT OF $151 

790
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,162
BILLION BECAUSE THEY SEND THE 

791
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,597
MERCEDES IN, THEY SEND THE BMW 

792
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,531
IN, THEY SEND THEIR PRODUCTS 

793
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,166
IN, WE SEND THINGS TO THEM AND 

794
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,735
THEY SAY NO, THANK YOU, WE 

795
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,136
DON'T TAKE YOUR PRODUCT, THAT'S 

796
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,103
NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. 

797
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:47,571
FOR ALL THOSE FREE TRADERS OUT 

798
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:49,773
THERE, THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE, 

799
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:50,841
THAT'S STUPID TRADE. 

800
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:54,178
STUPID TRADE. 

801
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:59,684
SO I SAID TO THEM, AS THE GREAT 

802
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,952
HAROLD HAMM WOULD SAY, BECAUSE 

803
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,854
TO HIM IT'S A NATURAL THING, TO 

804
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,222
SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN HERE -- I 

805
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:08,092
KNOW SOME OF THE BOOK -- THEY 

806
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,360
ARE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE -- I 

807
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,862
SAID VERY SIMPLY, LOOK, IF YOU 

808
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,397
TREAT US THAT WAY AND YOU DON'T 

809
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,664
TAKE DOWN YOUR BARRIERS, THEY 

810
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:14,899
CALL THEM TRAIT -- YOU KNOW 

811
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:15,432
WHAT THEY CALL THEM, 

812
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:16,166
NONMONETARY BARRIERS. 

813
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,835
THEY'RE BARRIERS. 

814
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:19,870
JUST LIKE CHARGING A BIG TERRY. 

815
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,106
THEY CHARGE US MANY TIMES TARIFF

816
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:29,680
-- IF WE SEND THEM A CAR, WHICH 

817
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,715
THEY DON'T WANT, THEY 

818
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:31,716
PRACTICALLY DON'T TAKE -- BUT 

819
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,984
ON THE ASSUMPTION IT GOT 

820
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:33,951
THROUGH, THEY CHARGE US MANY, 

821
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,353
MANY TIMES WHAT WE CHARGE THEM. 

822
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:39,223
AND I SAID, LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT 

823
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,758
GOING TO TREAT US FAIRLY, IF 

824
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,293
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TREAT OUR 

825
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:42,893
WORKERS, COMPANIES, FARMERS 

826
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:44,629
FAIRLY, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 

827
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,297
TAKE OUR FARM PRODUCT LIKE WE 

828
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,799
TAKE YOUR FARM PRODUCT, WE'RE 

829
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,566
GOING TO TAX THOSE BEAUTIFUL 

830
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,068
MERCEDES BENZ COMING IN AND WE 

831
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,869
ARE GOING TO TAX BMWS THAT ARE 

832
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,606
COMING IN. 

833
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,674
>> [ APPLAUSE ] 

834
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:02,513
>> AND WE ARE ALREADY TAXING 

835
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,447
THROUGH TARIFFS, THEIR STEEL 

836
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,749
AND THEIR ALUMINUM. 

837
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,584
AND BY THE WAY, DO YOU SEE 

838
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,852
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR STEEL 

839
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:08,986
INDUSTRY IN THE LAST FOUR 

840
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,189
MONTHS? 

841
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:15,726
IT'S BOOMING AGAIN, FOLKS. 

842
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:16,059
IT'S BOOMING. 

843
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:20,364
UNITED STATES STEEL IS OPENING 

844
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:25,036
UP SIX PLANTS THROUGH EXPANSION 

845
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,771
AND NEW -- I WAS IN SOUTH 

846
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,805
CAROLINA THE OTHER NIGHT. 

847
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,140
WHERE, BY THE WAY, A GREAT 

848
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,446
CANDIDATE WON VERY EASILY, YOU 

849
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,981
KNOW OUR TRACK RECORD IS 

850
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:37,581
EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD, RIGHT? 

851
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:38,816
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, FOR KEVIN, 

852
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,183
THAT'S WHY. 

853
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,017
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. 

854
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:44,021
BUT THEY JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY 

855
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,590
-- THEY HAVE A STEEL COMPANY 

856
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,595
CALLED GEORGETOWN, IT'S BEEN 

857
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,595
CLOSED FOR FOUR YEARS. 

858
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:52,897
THEY ANNOUNCED THE DAY BEFORE I 

859
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:53,530
GOT TO SOUTH CAROLINA THAT 

860
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,499
GEORGETOWN STEEL IS REOPENING 

861
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:59,904
AND HIRING 600 PEOPLE. 

862
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:05,776
NOT SO COMPLICATED. 

863
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,478
WE PUT TARIFFS ON SOLAR PANELS 

864
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,214
BECAUSE CHINA WAS FLOODING THE 

865
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,516
MARKET AND IT WASN'T GOOD 

866
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,049
STUFF. 

867
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,585
WE HAD 32 PLANTS, TWO WERE OPEN 

868
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,121
AND THEY WERE BARELY BREATHING. 

869
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,056
THEY WERE ON MOUTH-TO-MOUTH 

870
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:21,192
RESUSCITATION. 

871
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:25,196
WE PUT A 30% TAX ON SOLAR 

872
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,597
PANELS COMING INTO THE UNITED 

873
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,197
STATES. 

874
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:28,866
NOW THOSE TWO PLANTS ARE DOING 

875
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:29,400
GREAT. 

876
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,268
AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 

877
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:36,440
OPENING AT LEAST TEN, 11 OR 12 

878
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,009
AND PROBABLY HAVE THEM ALL OPEN 

879
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:38,342
VERY SOON. 

880
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,643
AND THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE HIGH-

881
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,143
QUALITY PANELS AND A LOT OF 

882
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:43,781
JOBS. 

883
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,947
SAME THING WITH WASHING 

884
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:47,818
MACHINES. 

885
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:48,985
SOUNDS SORT OF TACKY, WASHING 

886
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,088
MACHINES, BIG BUSINESS. 

887
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,123
THEY WERE DUMPING -- DIFFERENT 

888
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:54,492
COUNTRIES -- I DON'T WANT TO 

889
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,525
TELL YOU THIS COUNTRY -- I 

890
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:58,496
ACTUALLY LIKE THIS COUNTRY BUT 

891
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,764
-- SOMETIMES OUR WORST ENEMIES 

892
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,098
ARE OUR SO-CALLED FRIENDS OR 

893
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:01,498
ALLIES, RIGHT? 

894
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:02,800
BUT THEY WERE DUMPING WASHING 

895
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,869
MACHINES. 

896
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,404
PUT A BIG TARIFF ON -- 30% -- 

897
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:12,210
WE ARE NOW MAKING WALKING -- 

898
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,511
WASHING MACHINES BACK IN OUR 

899
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:13,778
COUNTRY. 

900
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,079
WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING? 

901
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,280
THINK OF IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER 

902
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,515
HEAR THIS FROM THE FAKE NEWS. 

903
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,682
WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING? 

904
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:18,982
WHAT ELSE? 

905
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:19,916
WE ARE CREATING JOBS, NUMBER 1, 

906
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:20,951
AND TAKING IN BILLIONS AND 

907
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,586
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR 

908
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:23,788
COFFERS. 

909
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:29,060
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME -- 

910
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,695
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE HAD 

911
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,195
TARIFFS. 

912
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:35,099
BECAUSE YOU HAD PRESIDENTS LIKE 

913
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,133
PRESIDENT McKINLEY AND ROOSEVELT

914
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:40,871
AND OTHERS -- ROOSEVELT WON -- 

915
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:45,209
WHO LIKED THE IDEA OF FOREIGN 

916
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,711
COUNTRIES WHEN THEY COME IN AND 

917
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,012
WANT TO TAKE OUR WEALTH, THEY 

918
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,082
HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. 

919
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:51,948
THEY DON'T TAKE IT.

00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:29,039
OY, WHEN DO THEY GET OVER IT? 

1280
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,273
IT IS PRETTY AMAZING, POINT 

1281
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:34,645
AFTER POINT, GUILTY, GUILTY, 

1282
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:35,712
GUILTY, OH, SHE'S OKAY AND THEN 

1283
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,949
THEY GO AFTER US FOR A RUSSIAN 

1284
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:39,649
WITCH HUNT HOAX. 

1285
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:41,585
IT'S A HOAX. 

1286
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,120
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU 

1287
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,087
TALK ABOUT A DOUBLE STANDARD, 

1288
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,489
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A DOUBLE 

1289
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,190
STANDARD, AND NOT EVEN

1290
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:47,758
ET CETERA? 

1291
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,692
NOBODY EVEN LOOKS. 

1292
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:49,159
I DON'T THINK. 

1293
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,594
UNLESS WE ARE GOING TO BE 

1294
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,061
SURPRISED SOMEDAY. 

1295
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,796
WE'LL SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT. 

1296
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,864
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHAT'S 

1297
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:58,101
HAPPENING IS SOMEWHAT OF A 

1298
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:05,508
MIRACLE BECAUSE WE WEREN'T 

1299
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:06,243
EXPECTED TO WIN. 

1300
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,878
EVERY TIME I GO OUT, WE HAVE 

1301
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,379
CROWDS LIKE THIS, WE WENT TO 

1302
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,715
MICHIGAN, WE WENT TO WISCONSIN, 

1303
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,682
BEEN DONE -- I THINK WISCONSIN 

1304
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:13,283
WAS 1952. 

1305
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,150
DWIGHT EISENHOWER. 

1306
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:32,502
AND WE WON WISCONSIN. 

1307
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:33,169
>>> I SAID WHY.

1308
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:34,137
LOOK AT THE THE CROWDS, LOOK AT

1309
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:34,437
THE PEOPLE.

1310
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:36,072
LOOK AT THE SIGNS OUTSIDE OF THE

1311
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:36,406
HOUSE.

1312
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:37,307
LOOK AT THE SIGNS.

1313
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,241
>> I HEARD.

1314
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,377
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT SO THAT BILL

1315
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,111
CLINTON, PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON

1316
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,145
WENT BACK AND HE WENT THROUGH

1317
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,381
MICHIGAN AND HE SAID YOU BETTER

1318
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,649
GET PEOPLE OUT TO MICHIGAN

1319
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,684
BECAUSE THERE'S A TRUMP-PENCE

1320
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,052
SIGN ON EVERY HOUSE.

1321
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,887
YOU BETTER GET PEOPLE OUT.

1322
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:54,358
AND THEY SAID OH NO, OUR

1323
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,592
STATISTICS SHOW THAT MICHIGAN

1324
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:57,027
CANNOT BE WON BY THE

1325
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:57,327
REPUBLICANS.

1326
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,362
WELL LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S

1327
00:49:59,362 --> 00:49:59,763
HAPPENED.

1328
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,631
CAR PLANTS ARE MOVING INTO

1329
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:01,898
MICHIGAN.

1330
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,199
JOBS ARE MOVING INTO MICHIGAN.

1331
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,804
MICHIGAN EASE VERY HAPPY WITH

1332
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,973

1333
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,675
WITH YOUR -- MICHIGAN'S VERY

1334
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,710
HAPPY WITH YOUR PRESIDENT.

1335
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,812
THEY SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO

1336
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:16,379
BILL CLINTON.

1337
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:19,116
AND WE JUST HAD OUR HIGHEST POLL

1338
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:19,349
NUMBERS.

1339
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,784
WATCH THE FAKERS BACK THERE.

1340
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:30,227
THEY'LL BE TALKING.

1341
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,295
WELL, YOU SAW THE POLLS.

1342
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,030
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE.

1343
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,832
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THEY SAID

1344
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,500
I WAS AN INTERLOPER.

1345
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,536
HOW BAD IS THAT?

1346
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,337
AN INTERLOPER.

1347
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,673
AND NOW THEY SAY, A COUPLE OF

1348
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,277
POLLS THAT HE'S THE MOST

1349
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,211
POWERFUL, MOST POPULAR

1350
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,646
REPUBLICAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE

1351
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,080
PARTY.

1352
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:57,153
AND A LITTLE WHILE AGO I WAS AN

1353
00:50:57,153 --> 00:51:04,194
INTERLOPER.

1354
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,329
THEY CAME OUT MORE POPULAR THAN

1355
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,464
A MAN I LIKE, RONALD REAGAN.

1356
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:11,301
THINK OF IT, YOU GO FROM

1357
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:11,634
INTERLOPER.

1358
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:13,136
THAT'S A HORRIBLE TERM, RIGHT?

1359
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,804
I WAS JUST DOING MY THING.

1360
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:16,906
I'M NOT AN INTERLOPER.

1361
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:19,376
BUT WE HAVE TREMENDOUS -- LOOK

1362
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,178
AT THE PEOPLE WE ENDORSED.

1363
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:22,678
DAN DONOVAN.

1364
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:24,480
HE WAS BEHIND.

1365
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,749
WE ENDORSED HIM.

1366
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,819
HE WON BY LIKE 24 POINTS OR

1367
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,753
SOMETHING LAST NIGHT IN STATEN

1368
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:33,390
ISLAND, NEW YORK, AND NEW YORK

1369
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:33,757
GENERALLY.

1370
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,626
DAN DON VAN, CONGRESSMAN --

1371
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:37,226
DONOVAN, CONGRESSMAN.

1372
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:38,628
LAST NIGHT WE HAD A GREAT

1373
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,029
EVENING BECAUSE WE WATCHED THAT

1374
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:41,498
TELEVISION AND WE WERE WINNING

1375
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,432
LEFT AND RIGHT.

1376
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,034
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL

1377
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:44,301
HAPPENED.

1378
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:49,005
AND ONE OF MY BIGGEST CRITICS, A

1379
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:49,806
SLOVENLY MAN NAMED JOE CROWLEY

1380
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:59,683
GOT HIS ASS KICKED.

1381
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,652
BY A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD A LOT

1382
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:02,918
OF ENERGY.

1383
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:05,288
SHE HAD A LOT OF ENERGY.

1384
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,058
I GUESS HE DIDN'T SEE IT.

1385
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:08,958
THEY COULDN'T FIND HIM.

1386
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,593
HE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY.

1387
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:13,930
HE ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF MONEY

1388
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:14,196
LEFT OVER.

1389
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:16,866
HE WAS GOING TO TAKE NANCY

1390
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:17,434
PELOSI'S PLACE.

1391
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,436
AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED

1392
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,137
BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP NANCY

1393
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,940
PELOSI RIGHT WHERE SHE IS WITH

1394
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,374
MAXINE WATERS.

1395
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,744
I WANT TO KEEP NANCY PELOSI,

1396
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,914
PLEASE, I WANT TO MAKE A PLEA TO

1397
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,149
MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS.

1398
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:36,052
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T

1399
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:36,719
REMOVE NANCY PELOSI.

1400
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,456
SHE SHOULD BE WHERE SHE IS.

1401
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:43,927
AND PLEASE KEEP MAXINE WATERS ON

1402
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,964
THE AIR AS YOUR FACE AND YOUR

1403
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:54,671
MOUTHPIECE FOR THE DEMOCRAT

1404
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,039
PARTY.

1405
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,342
PLEASE.

1406
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,344
MAXINE AND NANCY.

1407
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,647
SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN A WAY

1408
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,048
WHEN HE GOT BEATEN BECAUSE HE

1409
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,750
WAS GOING TO TAKE HER PLACE I

1410
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,183
THINK.

1411
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,919
NOW HE'S JUST LOOKING AT US AND

1412
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,887
SAYING DARLING, WHAT HAPPENED?

1413
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,723
POLITICS IS A MEAN GAME, ISN'T

1414
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:13,889
IT?

1415
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:16,993
IT'S A MEAN -- IT'S A FLEETING

1416
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:17,560
GAME.

1417
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,863
SIX MONTHS AGO REPUBLICANS

1418
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,032
PASSED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND

1419
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:29,171
REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

1420
00:53:29,171 --> 00:53:31,641
OUR PLAN DOUBLED THE CHILD TAX

1421
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:36,913
CREDIT THANK YOU TO IVANKA

1422
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:37,180
TRUMP.

1423
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,149
SHE WANTED THAT SO BADLY.

1424
00:53:40,149 --> 00:53:42,118
SHE REALLY GOT TO BE A PEST.

1425
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:46,423
DAD, YOU'VE GOT TO GET CHILD TAX

1426
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:46,856
CREDIT.

1427
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:47,990
I SAID, DARLING, NOBODY KNOWS

1428
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,093
WHAT IT IS.

1429
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,363
SHE SAID THE WOMEN KNOW, DAD.

1430
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,231
THE WOMEN KNOW.

1431
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:58,435
MY DAUGHTER AND MY WIFE,

1432
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,770
MELANIA, THEY LOVE THE WOMEN.

1433
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,674
AND THE WOMEN LOVE THEM.

1434
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,442
THE WOMEN LOVE THEM.

1435
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:08,845
AND THE MEN LOVE THEM.

1436
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,046
CHILD TAX CREDIT.

1437
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,015
PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT THAT

1438
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:12,449
MUCH.

1439
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,416
IT'S VERY SUBSTANTIAL.

1440
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,553
AND YOU KNOW WE GOT IT FOR YOU.

1441
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:19,623
WE SLASHED TAXES FOR WO

1442
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,991
FAMILIES, MOST OF THEM IN HALF,

1443
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:25,228
AND SAVED OUR FAMILY FARMS AND

1444
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,864
OUR SMALL BUSINESSES BY

1445
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,166
ELIMINATING THE ESTATE TAX IN

1446
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,100
ALMOST ALL CASES.

1447
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,636
IT'S KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX.

1448
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:35,872
AND NOW WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR

1449
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,675
SMALL BUSINESS OR YOUR FARM YOU

1450
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:39,909
LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR

1451
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,211
CHILDREN DON'T GO HAVE TO --

1452
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,013
THEY DON'T GO TO THE BANK,

1453
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:45,882
BORROW MONEY, AND END UP LOSING

1454
00:54:45,882 --> 00:55:01,598
THE FARM OR LOSING THE BUSINESS.

1455
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,134
AND KEVIN AND JOHN, THE WHOLE

1456
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,768
GROUP THEY HELPED US A LOT.

1457
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:07,470
AND GUESS WHAT?

1458
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,006
HEIDI VOTED AGAINST IT.

1459
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:10,473
OKAY?

1460
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,808
SHE VOTED AGAINST IT.

1461
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:14,810
HEIDI VOTED AGAINST IT.

1462
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,612
AND SHE'S ALWAYS GOING TO VOTE

1463
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:16,879
AGAINST.

1464
00:55:16,879 --> 00:55:19,182
SHE MAY GIVE US A COUPLE OF

1465
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,017
QUICKIE VOTES, YOU KNOW, BEFORE

1466
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:21,884
THE ELECTION.

1467
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:22,418
SHE MIGHT.

1468
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:23,286
BECAUSE SHE HAS NO CHOICE.

1469
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,722
BUT THE DAY AFTER THAT ELECTION

1470
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:28,358
SHE'S VOTING PARTY LINE 100%.

1471
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,261
MORE THAN 100 UTILITY COMPANIES

1472
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,130
NATIONWIDE HAVE SLASHED PRICES

1473
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:34,897
FOR CUSTOMERS.

1474
00:55:34,897 --> 00:55:36,933
SAVING THEM AND THIS COUNTRY

1475
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,169
MUCH MORE THAN $3 BILLION WHICH

1476
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:42,572
GOES AND REDUCES YOUR ELECTRIC

1477
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:47,443
AND UTILITY BILLS.

1478
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:50,647
HEIDI AND EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT

1479
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:54,250
VOTED AGAINST OUR TAX CUTS.

1480
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,686
WE'RE ALSO FIXING THE DISASTROUS

1481
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,222
TRADE DEALS THAT HAVE PLUNDERED

1482
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:01,524
OUR WEALTH, GUTTED OUR

1483
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,393
COMMUNITIES, UNDERMINED OUR

1484
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:04,627
GREAT FARMERS, TAKEN OUR JOBS.

1485
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:09,399
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE TRADE FAIR

1486
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,867
AND RECIPROCAL.

1487
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,167
RECIPROCAL.

1488
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,035
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

1489
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,736
THEY DO IT TO US.

1490
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:21,644
WE DO IT TO THEM.

1491
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,047
AND WE ARE PLACING VERY BIG

1492
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,182
TARIFFS ON SOME OF THESE

1493
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,584
COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE

1494
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,218
TARIFFS ON US.

1495
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:30,019
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

1496
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,589
I WONDER WHERE THESE PEOPLE COME

1497
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:33,656
FROM.

1498
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:34,056
EVEN POLITICIANS.

1499
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:35,824
SO WE'LL HAVE A COUNTRY.

1500
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:36,826
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1501
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,795
I CAN ALMOST NAME ANY OF THEM.

1502
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:41,397
THEY HAVE MASSIVE TARIFFS ON OUR

1503
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,232
PEOPLE.

1504
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,834
ON OUR WORKERS, ON OUR FARMERS,

1505
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,669
ON OUR COUNTRY, ON OUR

1506
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:46,936
COMPANIES.

1507
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,404
SO WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO PUT

1508
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,273
TARIFFS ON THEM.

1509
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,474
AND I'LL HAVE POLITICIANS AND

1510
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,911
OTHER PEOPLE COME TO ME, OH

1511
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,712
PLEASE, WE WANT FREE TRADE.

1512
00:56:56,712 --> 00:56:58,180
HOW IS IT FREE TRADE?

1513
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,581
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

1514
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:02,151
CHINA, IF WE MAKE A CAR AND SELL

1515
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:04,554
IT INTO CHINA THEY CHARGE US A

1516
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:04,921
25% TAX.

1517
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,190
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, 25%.

1518
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,226
WHEN THEY MAKE A CAR AND SELL IT

1519
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:11,160
INTO THE UNITED STATES, AND

1520
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,963
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM, WE

1521
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,366
CHARGE THE GRAND TOTAL OF 2.5%

1522
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:22,171
AND THEY DON'T PAY THAT.

1523
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:23,039
AND THEN WHEN I WANT TO RAISE

1524
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,874
THE GAME AND PLAY THE GAME OF

1525
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,744
POKER, A GAME THAT WE CAN'T

1526
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,847
LOSE, I'LL GET EVEN POLITICIANS,

1527
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,849
MOSTLY DEMOCRATINGS, BUT EVEN A

1528
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,151
COUPLE -- DEMOCRATS, BUT EVEN A

1529
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,485
COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS.

1530
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:38,254
THEY'LLSAY WE WANT FREE TRADE.

1531
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:41,357
THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE.

1532
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,425
IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.

1533
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,793
JUST PLAY THE GAME FOR A LITTLE

1534
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,026
WHILE.

1535
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:45,361
IT'S A GAME WE CAN'T LOSE.

1536
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,831
I'VE SAID A COUPLE OF TIMES,

1537
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,232
WHEN WE'RE $500 BILLION DOWN

1538
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,134
THEY SAY TRUMP IS STARTING A

1539
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:51,400
TRADE WAR.

1540
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,636
I SAY, NO, THE TRADE WAR ENDED A

1541
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,338
LONG TIME AGO.

1542
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,740
AND THE UNITED STATES LOST

1543
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,309
BECAUSE OUR LEADERS DIDN'T TAKE

1544
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:06,616
CARE OF OUR PEOPLE AND OUR

1545
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:07,450
COMPANIES.

1546
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,719
SO WE'RE NOT STARTING A TRADE

1547
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:10,753
WAR, BUT WE'LL FINISH IT.

1548
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:11,754
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

1549
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:13,957
IN THE END, YOU KNOW WHAT'S

1550
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,224
GOING TO HAPPEN?

1551
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:17,360
AND IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING,

1552
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:17,994
ALREADY HAPPENING.

1553
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,294
THEY'RE GOING TO COME TO US.

1554
00:58:19,294 --> 00:58:21,097
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HEY,

1555
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,031
LET'S WORK IT OUT.

1556
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,233
AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK IT OUT.

1557
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:25,635
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

1558
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:26,636
BUT REMEMBER, IT IS, IT'S THE

1559
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:27,704
ART OF THE DEAL.

1560
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:28,738
ANYBODY CAN DO THE DEAL.

1561
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,706
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

1562
00:58:30,706 --> 00:58:33,209
THIS ONE DOESN'T GET MUCH

1563
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:33,743
SIMPLER.

1564
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:36,312
REMEMBER, IT'S TRUE, WHEN YOU'RE

1565
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,414
$500 BILLION DOWN YOU CAN'T

1566
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:38,982
LOSE.

1567
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:39,382
YOU ALREADY LOST.

1568
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,384
BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO START

1569
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:41,684
WINNING.

1570
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,420
OR AT LEAST WE'RE GOING TO MAKE

1571
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,954
IT FAIR.

1572
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,956
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO -- WE

1573
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,624
GOT TO MAKE IT FAIR.

1574
00:58:48,624 --> 00:58:50,960
AND THE FACT IS WE'VE HAD

1575
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,662
PRESIDENTS AND WE'VE HAD LEADERS

1576
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:56,132
THAT WORKED FOR THOSE PRESIDENTS

1577
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:59,536
NEGOTIATORS, TRADE REPS, WHO

1578
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,202
WERE MISSING IN ACTION.

1579
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:01,137
THEY WEREN'T DOING THEIR JOB.

1580
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,706
I WAS DEALT A LOT OF BAD HANDS.

1581
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,008
I WAS GIVEN NORTH KOREA WHERE,

1582
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:07,210
FRANKLY, WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO

1583
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:07,877
GOING TO WAR.

1584
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,847
YOU COULD HAVE LOST 30 MILLION

1585
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:11,280
PEOPLE.

1586
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:11,981
50 MILLION PEOPLE.

1587
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,117
SEOUL IS 30 MILES OFF THE

1588
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:14,350
BORDER.

1589
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,653
THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL

1590
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:17,353
CANNONS.

1591
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,389
THEY HAVE CANNONS, THOUSANDS OF

1592
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:19,756
THEM, POINTED.

1593
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:20,823
I HAD THE MEETING.

1594
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,424
WE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

1595
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:24,127
WE HAD A GREAT CHEMISTRY

1596
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:24,394
TOGETHER.

1597
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,129
THE FAKE NEWS WAS SO UPSET WHEN

1598
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,231
I SAID WE HAD A GOOD

1599
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:28,564
RELATIONSHIP.

1600
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:29,832
WE HAD A GOOD CHEMISTRY.

1601
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:32,001
THEY SAID THAT'S A HORRIBLE

1602
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:32,201
THING.

1603
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:32,434
NO, NO.

1604
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:33,902
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

1605
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:35,771
GETTING ALONG WITH COUNTRIES.

1606
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:37,273
GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA.

1607
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,408
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA.

1608
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:40,276
GETTING ALONG WITH THESE

1609
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,544
COUNTRIES IS A GOOD THING.

1610
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:42,812
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

1611
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:53,690
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

1612
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,793
AND SO WE HAVE THINGS COOKING

1613
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,060
NOW.

1614
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,928
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY.

1615
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,496
BUT WHEN PEOPLE RUSH IT, YOU

1616
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:01,798
KNOW, IT'S LIKE RUSHING THE

1617
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,065
TURKEY OUT OF THE STOVE.

1618
01:00:03,065 --> 01:00:04,600
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD.

1619
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,503
THE WOMEN CAN TELL ME, AND SOME

1620
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,872
OF THE MEN, SEE I HAVE TO BE

1621
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:10,472
POLITICALLY CORRECT.

1622
01:00:10,472 --> 01:00:13,643
SEE IN THE OLD DAYS I WOULD HAVE

1623
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:16,813
NEVER SAID -- I WOULD HAVE SAID

1624
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,413
IT'S TOO HOKE KI.

1625
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:19,949
BUT IT'S -- HOKEY.

1626
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,185
BUT IT'S TRUE.

1627
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,587
SOME OF THE MEN CAN TELL ME TOO.

1628
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,022
SOME OF THE MEN.

1629
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,290
BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

1630
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,024
THE MORE WE RUSH THE WORSE IT'S

1631
01:00:29,024 --> 01:00:30,125
GOING TO BE.

1632
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,795
THE LONGER WE TAKE THE BETTER

1633
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:33,429
YOUR FARMERS, YOUR PEOPLE ARE

1634
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,930
GOING TO BE GREAT.

1635
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,967
YOU KNOW, JONG AND KEVIN GAVE --

1636
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:43,005
JOHN AND KEVIN GAVE ME

1637
01:00:43,005 --> 01:00:44,040
SOMETHING.

1638
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,673
CANADIAN WHEAT.

1639
01:00:44,673 --> 01:00:46,175
MARKETS CONSISTENTLY

1640
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:46,808
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE UNITED

1641
01:00:46,808 --> 01:00:49,245
STATES WHEAT BY GRADING IT AS

1642
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:49,512
FEED.

1643
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,947
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

1644
01:00:51,947 --> 01:00:54,050
THEY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

1645
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,220
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THAT

1646
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:57,420
MEANS.

1647
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,489
I JUST KNOW THAT IT'S A BAD

1648
01:00:59,489 --> 01:00:59,922
DEAL.

1649
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:03,359
WHAT IN THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

1650
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,793
YEAH.

1651
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,628
BUT IT'S TRUE.

1652
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,930
CANADA CHARGES US ON DAIRY

1653
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,968
PRODUCTS A TARIFF OF 275% FOR

1654
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,937
YOUR FARMERS IN HERE.

1655
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:15,137
200.

1656
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:16,739
THAT'S LIKE SAYING WE DON'T WANT

1657
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:17,439
YOUR DAIRY PRODUCT.

1658
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,875
IT'S NO GOOD.

1659
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:23,045
THAT'S LIKE SAYING WE DON'T WANT

1660
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:25,515
NORTH DAKOTA, WISCONSIN, NEW

1661
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,683
YORK STATE WE DON'T WANT YOU TO

1662
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:29,852
-- 275%, AND I ACTUALLY HEAR

1663
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:30,753
THAT'S AN OLD NUMBER.

1664
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,655
THEY RAISED IT A NUMBER OF

1665
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:33,990
MONTHS AGO TO 300%.

1666
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,558
HOW HORRIBLE IS THAT?

1667
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,526
AND THEN JUSTIN GETS UP.

1668
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:40,596
HE SAID WE FOUGHT WORLD WAR I,

1669
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,497
WORLD WAR II TOGETHER.

1670
01:01:42,497 --> 01:01:42,999
ALL TRUE.

1671
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,867
WE LOVE CANADA.

1672
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,169
BUT THEY'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

1673
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:46,736
US.

1674
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,238
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

1675
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,539
WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

1676
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:53,209
THE ERA OF GLOBAL FREE LOADING

1677
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,711
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

1678
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,479
UNITED STATES IS OVER.

1679
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:02,051
IT'S JUST OVER.

1680
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:06,355
IT'S OVER.

1681
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:09,659
WE'RE ALSO RESTORING AMERICAN

1682
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,895
SECURITY BY REBUILDING OUR

1683
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,096
MILITARY.

1684
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:17,166
WE'VE SECURED A HISTORIC $700

1685
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,737
BILLION JUST GOT IT APPROVED.

1686
01:02:21,737 --> 01:02:22,972
$700 BILLION WE'RE REBUILDING

1687
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:23,538
OUR MILITARY.

1688
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:29,312
AND NEXT YEAR, ALREADY APPROVED,

1689
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,080
$716 BILLION, WE'RE REBUILDING

1690
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,413
OUR MILITARY.

1691
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:33,115
IT WILL BE BIGGER AND STRONGER

1692
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:34,316
THAN EVER BEFORE.

1693
01:02:34,316 --> 01:02:35,918
AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL NEVER HAVE

1694
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,620
TO USE IT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S

1695
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,188
BIGGER AND STRONGER, YOU TEND

1696
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:48,931
NOT TO HAVE TO USE IT, OKAY?

1697
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,735
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE GOT

1698
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:56,706
$6 BILLION FOR DRUGS AND

1699
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:59,641
FIGHTING OPIOID ABUSE.

1700
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:00,409
$6 BILLION.

1701
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,911
WE BELIEVE IN PEACE.

1702
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:07,517
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE PEACE THROUGH

1703
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,917
STRENGTH NOT WEAKNESS.

1704
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:10,352
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

1705
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:11,621
AND I'VE DIRECTED THE PENTAGON

1706
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,725
TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CREATING

1707
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,727
A SIXTH BRANCH OF THE UNITED

1708
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:21,697
STATES ARMED FORCES CALLED THE

1709
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:22,498
SPACE FORCE.

1710
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:27,970
THE SPACE FORCE.

1711
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,571
SPACE FORCE.

1712
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,539
BECAUSE SPACE IS THE NEW

1713
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:30,806
FRONTIER.

1714
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:31,974
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT

1715
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,676
GOING UP TO THE MOON AND GOING

1716
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:34,043
TO MARS.

1717
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,312
AND I WANT THE RICH GUYS.

1718
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,781
WE HAVE RICH GUYS, THEY LOVE

1719
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:39,347
THESE ROCKETS.

1720
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:41,183
LEASE THEM TO LAND, CHARGE THEM

1721
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:42,018
A LOT.

1722
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,785
THEY WANT TO SEND ROCKETS.

1723
01:03:43,785 --> 01:03:46,923
I LOOK AT IT WITH BEZOS, ELON

1724
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:47,156
MUSK.

1725
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,358
THEY ALL LOVE ROCKETS.

1726
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:49,959
I SAID THAT'S OKAY.

1727
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,527
LET THEM SEND A ROCKET TO MARS.

1728
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,562
I HOPE THEY GO FAST.

1729
01:03:53,562 --> 01:03:54,430
LET'S HELP THEM.

1730
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,998
LET'S MAKE IT REALLY GOOD FOR

1731
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:56,198
THEM.

1732
01:03:56,198 --> 01:03:57,533
AND IF THEY DO IT, WE'RE GOING

1733
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,769
TO CLAIM IT ON THE BEHALF OF THE

1734
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:00,102
UNITED STATES.

1735
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,236
WE'LL GIVE THEM NO CREDIT.

1736
01:04:01,236 --> 01:04:02,939
LET THEM SPEND THE MONEY, I

1737
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:03,339
THINK IT'S GREAT.

1738
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,708
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF MILITARY

1739
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,077
GUYS AND SPACE FROM A MILITARY

1740
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,779
STANDPOINT IS REALLY THE NEW

1741
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:10,046
FRONTIER.

1742
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,781
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPACE

1743
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:12,048
FORCE.

1744
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,317
EVERY DAY WE ARE KEEPING OUR

1745
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:14,584
PROMISES.

1746
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:17,220
BUT TO KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING

1747
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:22,491
WE NEED KEVIN KRAMER IN THE

1748
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,159
SENATE.

1749
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,463
ALL OF US TONIGHT ARE UNITED BY

1750
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,298
THE SAME TIRELESS VALUES.

1751
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:32,468
WE HAVE PRIDE IN OUR HISTORY,

01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:37,239

AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR NORTH

1764
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,551
DAKOTA, THANK YOU.

1765
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,453
THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF

1766
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:27,857
OUR COUNTRY ARE FORGOTTEN NO

1767
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:28,057
MORE.

1768
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:28,757
NO MORE.

1769
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,693
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ALL

1770
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:30,960
CAME FROM.

1771
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,197
AND BY THE WAY, OUR PEOPLE, THEY

1772
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,532
CALL IT THE BASE.

1773
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,168
THEY USED TO SAY IT'S 35%, THEN

1774
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,303
THEY SAID IT'S 40%.

1775
01:05:41,303 --> 01:05:44,740
THEN THEY SAID IT'S 42%.

1776
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,108
AND WE'RE DRIVING THEM CRAZY.

1777
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,010
NOW THEY SAY IT'S OVER 50%.

1778
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,913
AND THEN THEY SAID SOME GREAT

1779
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:51,146
PEOPLE.

1780
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:53,315
THEY SAID ANY TIME TRUMP GETS A

1781
01:05:53,315 --> 01:06:02,325

1782
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:05,594

THESE PEOPLE.

1786
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,232
I LOOK AT THEM.

1787
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,834
I SAY, THAT'S ELITE?

1788
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:14,236
WE GOT MORE MONEY.

1789
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,672
WE GOT MORE BRAINS.

1790
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,375
WE GOT BETTER HOUSES,

01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,610
WE GOT BETTER BOATS.

1793
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,845
WE'RE SMARTER THAN THEY ARE.

1794
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,746
AND THEY SAY THE ELITE.

1795
01:06:24,746 --> 01:06:26,415

01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,949
YOU'RE THE ELITE.

01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:28,850
WE'RE THE ELITE.

LOOK, LET'S FACE IT.

THE ELITE.

1803
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,394
