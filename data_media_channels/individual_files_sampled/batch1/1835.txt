an Emirati passenger plane takes off from Dubai on Monday the Civil Aviation Authority of the United Arab Emirates said to Qatar e-jets had intercepted a plane like this bound for Bahrain but in international airspace later UAE state media reported a second Bahrain bound plane had been intercepted by Qatar e-jets Qatar totally denies the claims we are used to such false claims since you know since the hacking of our national agency Qatar National Agency and this might go through for the normal people but for countries who deals and in high-tech and they have radar image and it's will be obvious for them that this is a lie Bahrain's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms that this hostile behavior by Qatar against civil aircraft has become frequent in recent times and jeopardizes the safety of civil aviation and poses a threat to the lives of civilians US Air Force central commands based in Qatar declined to comment but the timing here is interesting over the weekend Qatar father new complaint with the United Nations over what it called the second violation of Qatar II airspace by Emirati jets in recent weeks what's clear is the air blockade imposed on Qatar since last June has highlighted issues around how much airspace each country has Qatar for example with very little airspace and therefore they are reliant on the overflight of Bahrain's airspace to be able to fly in and out of their state so it's definitely puts spotlight on a potential problem that I'm sure could be addressed pending the outcome of this cob crisis this latest round of claim and counterclaim comes as cutters defense minister is in London to meet his UK counterparts recently Qatar placed an order worth nearly 7 billion dollars with britain's bae systems 424 fighter jets it's a reminder that despite the blockade qatar still has allies and spending power in a phone call with the Emir of Qatar on Monday president Trump praised the nation's efforts to fight terrorism something welcomed by the defense minister this is another improve to the you know the quartet the embargo quartets that all their claim the thirteen so-called claim are false and this is approved by friends and Ally every day something new comes up and prove that they were lying to their people it's hard to predict how long the crisis will last but cutters hoping it's legal and humanitarian arguments will persuade its allies to intervene nadine barber al jazeera London
