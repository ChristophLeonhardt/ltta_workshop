1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:14,400
My mother, Nina, I don’t
know a lot about her.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,420
I remember that she
was profoundly sad.

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,540
It was sad being around sadness.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,745
One day I came home from
school, and I said,

5
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:25,995
“Where’s Mom?”

6
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,690
He said that she’s
not coming home.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,060
He told me that she
had a heart attack.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,360
It was a real gift of a lie.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,360
I can’t imagine what
it would be like

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,090
if I was told that my
mother killed herself,

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,210
that she chose to die.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,180
As a child, I believed that when
she couldn’t take care of us,

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,330
she went up to heaven,
and she made sure

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,830
that we would be provided for by
finding the best stepmother she

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,440
could find and making
sure she came to us.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,150
I was 30-something when I
was like, O.K., let’s try this.

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,730
Maybe I’m ready now.

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,460
The first few months, 
I was actually really happy.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,560
He was just like a
little baby bird.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,760
I’d felt like we did bond.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,890
But he wasn’t growing,
and he wasn’t sleeping.

22
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,480
So I was feeling so
sad and so wretched.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,190
And in this like combination
of emotional anguish,

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,470
physical pain —

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,730
it was kind of like
ice and acid.

26
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,610
I found myself having
thoughts that were almost

27
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,560
like a mathematical equation.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,790
I’m a bad mom, which means that
I should get out of the way.

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,510
At some point, I just took a
whole lot of sleep medication,

30
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:59,330
and I woke up at St.
Vincent’s Hospital.

31
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,700
I believe that
she sent me back.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,670
My birth mom met me at
the gates and said,

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,310
“Nope, we’re not ready for you.

34
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,560
Go back down, and be
the mamma to your child

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,510
and be the wife to your husband.

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,870
Go live."

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,960
I was like just looking
to be strong enough

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,610
to have another child.

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,510
It was like the same tapes were
kind of like back in the brain.

40
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,360
Everything just felt
impossibly heavy.

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,210
At some point, I found
myself with my green belt.

42
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,480
I just wanted to wrap it
around my neck, and so I did.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,049
And I wanted to pull it hard.

44
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,276
And I did.

45
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:02,000
That was really
the call for help.

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,620
The gap between expectation and
reality is where the pain is.

47
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,140
And there I was experiencing
a [expletive] of pain.

48
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,732
And I kind of understood
how heavy it was,

49
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,940
but I think it was
heavier for her.

50
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,570
I was going to stay
alive for my children.

51
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,870
So I would be their mom for
the rest of their lives,

52
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,980
or for the rest of my life,
but a really long life.

53
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,680
My responsibility was
to take care of myself.

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,350
Dissolve the guilt
and the shame.

55
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,980
So we can just
deal with what is.

56
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,260
Get through it when it’s hard.

57
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,020
Celebrate it when it’s
wonderful, and live.

58
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:58,861
This panel in white coats
start asking me questions.

59
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,961
The one question I really
couldn't answer for

60
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:03,546
a long time was a very
basic question.

61
00:04:03,546 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I want?
