THE CALIFORNIA JUDGE WHO OFFERED
OR HANDED DOWN A LENIENT
SENTENCE TO BROCK TURNER
AFTER HE WAS CONVICTED OF
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A WOMAN HAS
BEEN RECALLED.
THIS IS GREAT NEWS.
IT IS JUDGE AARON PERSKY.
THIS CASE HAD EVERYTHING TO
DO WITH A YOUNG COLLEGE
STUDENT WHO WAS CUT SEXUALLY
ASSAULTING AN UNCONSCIOUS
WOMAN BEHIND A DUMPSTER.
HE WAS INCREDIBLY DRUNK, BUT
KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS THE
FIRST CALIFORNIA JUDGE RECALLED
IN NEARLY 90 YEARS.
PEOPLE WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT
THIS CASE, AND THE SENTENCE.
TO
MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE LOAD OF
WHAT THE JUDGE CITED IN THIS
RULING.
I FEEL LIKE SOME PEOPLE STILL
DON'T GET THIS CASE.
IS A DISPARITY AND TREATMENT.
HOW OFTEN ARE JUDGES GOING
AROUND GOING THIS YOUNG BLACK
KID, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW IT
COULD IMPACT HIS LIFE.
THAT IS A VERY POOR CHOICE OF
WORDS, BUT PUT ASIDE THE
BAD CHOICE OF WORDS AND THINK
ABOUT THE CONCEPT.
ANYTHING COULD BE CONSIDERED 20
MINUTES OF ACTION.
IT WASN'T 20 MINUTES OF
ACTION, IT WAS 20 MINUTES OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT.
JUNTA DUMPSTER.
YOU LOOK AT A YOUNG
AFRICAN-AMERICAN KID WHO MIGHT
BE DRUNK OR HIGH AND YOU SAY PUT
HIM AWAY, THAT IS HOW THEY ARE.
YOU LOOK AT A YOUNG RICH, WHITE
KID AND THEY SAY HE WAS DRUNK.
YOU SEE THE DISPARITY?
THAT WAS
THE CONCERN HERE.
I KNOW SOME FOLKS ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THIS RECALL BECAUSE THEY
ARE WORRIED THAT IT WILL LEAD
JUDGES TO BE TOUGHER ON
EVERYBODY.
AT THAT IS A LESSON THEY GET THE
NEW SHOULD RECALL ALL OF THEM.
IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU ARE
INSUFFICIENTLY TOUGH ON ALL
CRIMINALS, IT IS YOUR JOB TO
JUDGE AND MAKE JUDGMENT CALLS.
WAS IT A SERIOUS CRIME LIKE
SEXUAL ASSAULT OR WAS IT SMOKING
A JOINT WHICH IS NOT SERIOUS.
PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT IT BASED
ON INCOME DISPARITIES.
SO A JUDGE RELATES TO A RICH KID
WHO WAS GOING TO A GOOD SCHOOL.
THESE ARE MOST OF THE TIME Ã± I
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS JUDGE IS
EVIL AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HE
THOUGHT I WILL GET THE
WHITE KID OFF.
IT IS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS.
HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY
CONSCIOUSLY THINK OF IT.
I THINK IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE
ABLE TO TELL.
WE DON'T KNOW HIM PERSONALLY.
BUT I DO FEEL THAT THERE IS A
MIX OF THOSE WHO HAVE
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AND THOSE WHO
KNOW THEY HAVE THESE BIASES.
NOW IN THE TRUMP ERA FEEL
EMBOLDENED TO SHARE WITH THOSE
BIASES ARE.
NOW THEY ARE WORRIED THAT
JUDGES ARE GOING TO BE TOUGHER
BECAUSE OF THIS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I HAVE
SEEN A LOT OF ARTICLES ABOUT IT.
THIS IS BASED OFF OF A GUY
THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN
SENTENCED MORE THAN HE WAS.
YOU THINK PEOPLE LIKE THIS
SHOULD NOT BE SENTENCED BECAUSE
OF WHO THEY ARE?
THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH THE
JUDICIAL SYSTEM, SUPPORTING
A CORRUPT AND UNEVEN FOUNDATION
TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
YOU ONLY THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.
SO THIS WILL BE TOO TOUGH ON
PEOPLE.
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT MATTER TO
YOU APPARENTLY ARE PEOPLE
LIKE THIS GUY.
I THINK SOME GOOD PEOPLE
MIGHT BE THINKING THAT THEY WILL
BE EVEN TOUGHER ON CRIMINALS AND
THEN GET TOUGHER ON
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
AGAIN POOR PEOPLE THAT THEY
DON'T HAVE EMPATHY FOR.
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IF
THEY DO THAT, THEN THEY ARE
TERRIBLE JUDGES AND REALLY
SHOULD BE RECALLED.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS AND THE
LESSON YOU GET FROM THIS IS I
NEED TO BE TOUGHER ON BLACKS
OR ON POOR PEOPLE THEN YOU ARE
UNFIT TO BE A JUDGE BECAUSE
YOU ARE VERY DENSE.
I THINK PEOPLE THAT BRING
UP THAT POINT HAVE THEIR
HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE STORY, IT
WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE SENTENCE
HE HANDED DOWN TO BROCK TURNER,
AT THE TIME THERE WAS EXTENSIVE
ANALYSIS IN PREVIOUS SENTENCES
THAT HE GAVE TO PEOPLE OF COLOR.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT HE IS BEING
TOO LENIENT.
THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HIM
BEING INCREDIBLY LENIENT TO A
MAN THAT HAD BEEN CAUGHT
SEXUALLY HARASSING AN
UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN.
HE ONLY SERVED THREE MONTHS
BEHIND BARS.
COUNTLESS PEOPLE HAVE SPENT WAY
MORE TIME BEHIND BARS FOR
NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES.
THIS HAD EVERYTHING TO DO ABOUT
THAT, NOT ABOUT BEING TOO
LENIENT OVERALL.
WHETHER HIS BIAS WAS CONSCIOUS
OR UNCONSCIOUS, IT WAS PREVALENT
AND CLEAR.
AND SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO SERVE
JUSTICE, YOU HAVE TO DO IT EVEN
HANDEDLY AND IF PEOPLE TAKE
AWAY, JUDGES BETTER BE CAREFUL,
1.3 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED A
DISPOSITION AND PEOPLE ARE
WATCHING TO SEE IF THEY ARE
GOING TO BE UNJUST, GOOD, THAT
IS A PRETTY GOOD LESSON TO
LEARN.
IT YOU ONLY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS
THAT YOU SHOULD BE REALLY
HARSH AT ALL CRIMINALS NO MATTER
WHAT, THAT IS THE LESSON
YOU WANTED TO HEAR ANYWAY
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE
LESSON THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO
GIVE, THEY WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT JUSTICE AND THAT IS WHAT
THAT IS ABOUT.
