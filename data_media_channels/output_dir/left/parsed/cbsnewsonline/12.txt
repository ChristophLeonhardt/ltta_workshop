>> COURT DOCUMENTS A 44-YEAR-
OLD ALAYNA CASINO THE WAS 
LEADING THE OPERATION, WHOSE 
GOAL ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN 
OPERATIVES WAS TO SOW DISCORD 
IN THE US POLITICAL SYSTEM. 
FUNDED BY THE WEALTHY RUSSIAN 
OLIGARCH AN ALLY OF VLADIMIR 
PUTIN, THE TARGET WAS NEXT 
MONTHS MIDTERM ELECTIONS WITH 
EARLY VOTING IN MANY STATES 
ALREADY UNDERWAY. 
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT'S  NATIONAL SECURITY 
DIVISION, JOHN CARLIN, SAID 
RUSSIA IS SPENDING MILLIONS TO 
UNDERMINE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. 
>> WE ARE UNDER ATTACK NOW. 
AND, OUR ELECTIONS ARE AT RISK. 
THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS TAKING 
PLACE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF 
PUTIN HIMSELF. 
>> THROUGH THE USE OF FAKE 
AMERICAN ONLINE PERSONAS THEY 
FOCUSED ON DIVISIVE TOPICS LIKE 
IMMIGRATION, GUN CONTROL, RACE 
RELATIONS AND THE NFL NATIONAL 
ANTHEM DEBATE. 
ONE PRO TRUMP FACEBOOK ACCOUNT 
AND THE FAKE PERSONA OF BERTHA 
MALONE POSTED THIS IMAGE OF 
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SAYING THAT HE 
CREATED $3 BILLION WORTH OF NEW 
REGULATIONS WELL PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WIPED AWAY $22 BILLION 
WORTH OF REGULATIONS. 
THAT SAME ACCOUNT POSTED THIS 
ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
MESSAGE, ARGUING THAT DEPORTING 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SAVES 
AMERICANS MONEY. 
DEPORT THEM ALL IT SAID. 
>> THIS OPERATION WAS VERY 
SIMILAR TO THE RUSSIANS 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, 
SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE. 
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, 
JOHN BOLTON, WILL TRAVEL TO 
MOSCOW TOMORROW. 
INTERFERENCE IS LIKELY TO COME 
UP.
CBS NEWS, WASHINGTON. 
>>>  FOR MORE ON THIS, FORMER 
US ATTORNEY IN YOU ESSES 
EASTERN DISTRICT, CURATIVE WILL 
TRANSFER NOW. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 
SO, HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS? 
CAN YOU BREAK DOWN EXACTLY WHAT 
IT WAS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO 
DO? 
>> YEAH. 
THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. 
AND, IT IS -- SHE IS CHARGED IN 
A CONSPIRACY THAT IS SELF-
DESCRIBED AS AN INFORMATION WAR 
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 
IT IS A REAL THREAT TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY, AND WHAT IS NEW 
ABOUT THIS AS MENTIONED IN THE 
OPENING, IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO 
INTERFERE WITH OUR UPCOMING 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, WHICH IS 
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE 
SEEN PREVIOUSLY. 
>> HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT THAT 
ONE INDIVIDUAL IS BEING CHARGED 
RATHER THAN A WHOLE TROLL 
FACTORY? 
>> RIGHT, SO -- THE PROCEDURE 
THAT WE SEE HERE LOOKS VERY 
MUCH LIKE THIS WAS A SPECIFIC 
EXPERT TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY, 
TO ARREST THIS PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUAL. 
SO -- THE CHARGES THEMSELVES 
AND THE PRIOR INTERNET RESEARCH 
AGENCY INDICTMENT SUGGESTS A 
MUCH BROADER GROUP OF PEOPLE 
THAN THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL. 
BUT, THIS PARTICULAR PROCEDURE 
THAT WE SEE HERE LOOKS VERY 
MUCH LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED TO 
TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARREST 
THIS ONE PERSON WHILE SHE WAS 
IN A PLACE WHERE SHE COULD BE 
ARRESTED. 
>> AND PRESUMABLY SHE HAD SOME 
SORT OF LEADERSHIP ROLE? 
>> SHE IS NAMED AS THE CHIEF 
ACCOUNTANT OF THIS GROUP, OF 
THIS CONSPIRACY, WITH 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL ASPECTS 
OF THE FINANCING. 
SO, THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS 
GOING TO HAVE VERY DETAILED 
KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THIS 
CONSPIRACY WORK AND INFORMATION 
ABOUT ITS METHODS AND WHAT IT 
ACTUALLY DID. 
>> HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT SHE 
WILL BE ARRESTED AND STAND 
TRIAL? 
>> SO, THAT IS A GREAT 
QUESTION. 
AND, ORDINARILY INDICTMENTS 
LIKE THIS -- OR, CHARGES LIKE 
THISÃSOMETIMES THEY ARE 
CRITICIZED FOR BEING KIND OF 
PAPER EXERCISES. 
YOU KNOW, THE CRITICISM IS THAT 
THE DEFENDANTS WILL NEVER SEE A 
COURTROOM. 
THIS PROCEDURE LOOKS DIFFERENT. 
THIS WAS A COMPLAINT. 
IT WAS FILED AT THE END OF 
SEPTEMBER AND IT WAS UNSEALED 
JUST NOW, VERY CLOSE TO OUR 
MIDTERM ELECTION.  MY EDUCATED 
GUESS IS THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS 
IN A POSITION WHERE SHE COULD 
BE ARRESTED.  
NOW, DOES THIS INDICTMENT MEAN 
ANYTHING FOR THE ROBERT MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> WELL, INDIRECTLY. 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR HERE 
IS THAT THESE CHARGES WERE 
BROUGHT BY THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY DIVISION OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, NOT BY 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. 
BUT, THEY DOVETAIL VERY CLOSELY 
WITH THE INTERNET RESEARCH 
AGENCY INDICTMENT, WHICH THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL RETURNED AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. 
IN FACT, THEY OVERLAP VERY 
CLOSELY. 
SO, WHAT THIS CHARGE INDICATES 
IS THAT IS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF 
THE CONSENSUS VIEW OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT 
RUSSIANS WERE INTERFERING WITH 
OUR ELECTION IN THE PAST AND 
NOW THIS NEW SET OF CHARGES 
SHOWS IT IS CONTINUING UP UNTIL 
NOW WITH AN EFFORT TO INTERFERE 
WITH THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
>> THAT IS WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT. 
NOW, HAS THERE BEEN ANY RESPONSE
FROM HER OR HER ATTORNEYS OR 
ANYONE RELATED TO HER? 
>> WE DO NOT KNOW THAT YET. 
BUT, I HAVE NOT READ COVERAGE 
OF THAT. 
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE IT WAS 
SEALED IN SUPPORT OF AN 
EXTRADITION PROCEEDING THAT MAY 
BE OCCURRING IN A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY. 
SO, FRANKLY, GIVEN THE 
ALLEGATIONS AND THE INTERNET 
RESEARCH INDICTMENT IN 
FEBRUARY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT 
TH CO-CONSPIRATORS HERE WOULD 
BE PERHAPS MORE CAREFUL ABOUT 
TRAVELING TO AN ALLIED COUNTRY 
THAT WOULD SUPPORT US IN 
EXTRADITING SOMEBODY THAT WAS 
SUBJECT TO CHARGES HERE. 
MY EDUCATED GUESS ABOUT THIS IS 
THAT MISS KHUSYAYNOVA  GOT A 
LITTLE AHEAD OF HER SKIS AND 
WENT SOMEWHERE WHERE SHE COULD 
BE ARRESTED. 
SO, I WILL BE LOOKING FOR NEWS 
OF INTEREST PERHAPS OVERSEAS 
AND ALSO IN INDICTMENT.  
THESE CHARGES WERE BROUGHT BY A 
COMPLAINT. 
>> WE DO NOT KNOW HER LOCATION 
RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU HAVE REASON 
TO SUSPECT SHE MAY BE IN AN 
ALLIED COUNTRY? 
>> THIS PROCEDURE, THE WAY THAT 
THEY BROUGHT THESE CHARGES IS 
THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD -- IF 
YOU KNEW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO 
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARREST 
SOMEBODY, THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD 
PLAY YOUR CARDS IF YOU ARE A 
PROSECUTOR, AS CLOSE TO YOUR 
CHEST AS POSSIBLE.  
WITH THE UTMOST OF SECRECY.  
YOU SEAL THESE CHARGES, THEY 
ARE WAITING. 
WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES YOU 
AND SEAL IT, AND YOU ACT UPON 
AN ARREST WARRANT. 
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE IF MISS KHUSYAYNOVA 
MATERIALIZES  IN THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. 
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SEE US 
TODAY.

NOT CONVINCED. 
>> MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT I WAS 
NOT THE TARGET. 
ITWAS VERY CLOSE CONFINED 
SPACE, BUT I DON'T THINK I WAS 
THE TARGET. 
>> A SPACE SO CAN FIND THAT

>> AUS MILITARY SPOKESMAN WE 
CONTACTED HERE IN KABUL

PAST LOTTERY WINNERS I HAVE TO 
ASK YOU -- DO YOU PLAY THE 
LOTTO? 
>> I DO. 
YOU HAVE UNTIL 10:40 TONIGHT. 
I'M GOING TO DEFINITELY PLAY. 
>> SO, WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST 
MISTAKES THAT YOU HAVE SEEN 
PAST LOTTERY WINNERS MAKE AND 
WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE TO 
TONIGHT'S WINNER? 
>> THEY GET INUNDATED, AS YOU 
CAN IMAGINE BY FINANCIAL 
PLANNERS, THE STATE'S LAWYERS, 
ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE, AND THE 
MISTAKES THEY MAKE IS THEY HAVE 
TO REALLY -- FIRST, THEY HAVE 
TO IGNORE 99% OF THE PEOPLE IN 
GO WITH A TRUSTED ADVISOR THEY 
KNOW ALL AND RELY ON AND 
RESPECT. 
AND, JUST -- IT IS A LIFE 
CHANGER. 
OBVIOUSLY. 
>> WHAT ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO DOES 
NOT HAVE A NETWORK OF FINANCIAL 
ADVISORS AND THEIR SHOPPING FOR 
SOMEBODY NEW, WHAT DO THEY DO? 
>> THEY HAVE TO TALK TO PEOPLE 
THEY CAN TRUST, PARENTS, 
CHILDREN -- GRANDPARENTS, 
SOMEBODY WHO THEY -- CAN 
ESSENTIALLY GUIDE THEM. 
>> NOT THE LONG-LOST NEPHEW. 
>> THERE WILL BE A LOT OF LONG-
LOST PEOPLE AND MANY OF THEM 
WERE NEVER NEPHEWS. 
IT IS UNFORTUNATE, BUT IT IS 
THE NATURE OF THE GAME THAT 
PEOPLE SORT OF PREY ON THESE -- 
SOMEBODY WHO GETS MONEY. 
>> WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE AS FAR 
AS THE LUMP SUM PAYMENT VERSUS 
THE YEARLY PAYOUT? 
>> THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO 
DO IS MAKE SURE AT THAT 
TICKET IS HELD IN A BOX. 
GET THIS LOCKED UP. 
THAT IS A VERY VALUABLE 
COMMODITY. 
IF YOU LOSE THE TICKET YOU LOSE 
YOUR PRIZE. 
IT DEPENDS, IT DEPENDS ON THE 
FINANCIAL SITUATION AS FAR AS A 
LUMP SUM OR OVERTIME. 
IT DEPENDS ON THEIR AGE, 
DEPENDS ON THEIR INCOME 
BRACKET. 
THEY INCOME BRACKET IS GOING TO 
CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. 
BUT, YOU PAY A HEAVY TAX. 
IT IS A TAX. 
IT IS AN INCOME TAX. 
IT IS 40+ PERCENT. 
THE NEW CODE, A LITTLE BIT 
LESS. 
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE. 
SO, YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE IT ALL 
UP FRONT. 
IF YOU ARE YOUNGER, YOU MAY 
WANT IT OVERTIME. 
I QUITE FRANKLY PREFER IT ALL 
UP FRONT. 
IF I WIN THIS ONE. 
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN THEN 
CONTROL THE MONEY AND IT IS 
LESS, BUT IT IS NOT -- 
>> YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO FEELS 
COMFORTABLE CONTROLLING YOUR 
FINANCIAL SITUATION. 
IF IT IS SOMEBODY THAT IS A 
LITTLE WORRIED, WHETHER THEY 
ARE GOING TO USE THE MONEY 
WISELY, WOULD YOU RECOMMEND 
THAN THE YEARLY PAYOUT? 
>> WHEN YOU'RE TALKING THESE 
KIND OF NUMBERS, THEN YES, 
YEARLY PAYOUT IS FINE.  
NORMALLY THERE IN THE TENS OF 
MILLIONS, WHICH IS TAXED AT 5 
MILLION. 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $1 BILLION. 
THE NUMBER IS STAGGERING. 
I'M THINKING -- DR. EVIL. 
BUT, $1 BILLION -- WHATEVER THE 
PAYOUT WOULD BE ANNUALLY IS 
STILL GOING TO BE IN THE TENS 
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
SO, YEAH. 
AN ANNUAL PAYOUT IS NOT BAD 
$.10 MILLION EVERY YEAR. 
>> IT IS ALL GOOD. 
IT IS ALL GOOD. 
WHAT ARE WE ARGUING OVER? 
NOW, WHAT ABOUT THESE CASES 
WHERE PEOPLE GO IN AS AN OFFICE 
POOL. 
ARE THERE EXTRA LEGAL 
DIFFICULTIES TO THAT? 
AND HAVE YOU SEEN FIGHTS ERUPT 
OVER THAT? 
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF LEGAL 
CONSIDERATIONS SO, WHAT YOU 
HAVE TO DO IS ESSENTIALY PUT 
IT IN WRITING. 
YOU KNOW, HAVE A FORMAL 
AGREEMENT BEFORE.  
YOU SAY -- LET'S HAVE THE 
FOLLOWING FIVE PEOPLE GO IN, 
PUT IN FIVE DOLLARS EACH. 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN 
WRITING BECAUSE AT THE END OF 
THE DAY IT IS A CONTRACT AND 
THE QUESTIO IS WHAT IS THE 
INTENT OF THE PARTIES? 
IF YOU ARE FIGHTING OVER TO THE 
SIXTH PERSON SAYS YOU ARE IN 
AND YOU HAVE AN EMAIL SAYING 
YOU REALLY WERE NOT. 
WE ALL PAID, SO WE ARE IN THIS 
GROUP, IT IS BETTER. 
AND, HE ALSO HAVE FAMILY FIGHTS 
PRETTY WILL HAVE FAMILY FIGHTS. 
THE COUSIN SAYS I WAS PART OF 
THAT IF YOU WILL TEAM OF 
WINNERS. 
SO, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE DONE 
IN WRITING AND THERE IS A LOT 
OF LITIGATION BECAUSE $1 
BILLION IS OUTRAGEOUS BUT EVEN 
$100 MILLION, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 
IT.  
HE WILL FIGHT OVER THAT, 
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE FIGURE THEY 
GET THEIR SHOT, THEY GET THEIR 
LAWYER ON A CONTINGENCY AND 
THEY WILL FIGHT IT. 
>> MOST OF THE TIME THEY LOSE. 
>> WITHOUT ANY -- WITHOUT A 
CONCRETE PIECE OF PAPER. 
>> SOMETHING. 
BECAUSE, AT THE END OF THE DAY, 
WHAT DID YOU INTEND WHEN THAT 
PERSON WALKED UP AND PAID FOR 
THE LOTTERY TICKET? 
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS 
GOING TO RULE OUT. 
>> SINCE YOU PRESENTED A LOT OF 
PAST WINNERS, ARE THEY ALL 
HAPPY, DOES IT BUY HAPPINESS? 
>> IT IS FUNNY, THEY ARE HAPPY, 
BUT I SAW A STUDY NOT LONG AGO 
THAT SAID SEVERAL OF THEM ARE 
BACK WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE 
úTH 
SO, EITHER SPENT THE MONEY 
UNWISELY, OR INVOLVED WITH 
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS REPUTABLE 
AS OTHERS. 
SO, I DID SEE -- 
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU 
LIVE NOW TO MESA, ARIZONA, 
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING 
THE STAGE AT A MAKE AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN RALLY. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
GOD BLESS THE USA
>> HELLO, ARIZONA. 
WE LOVE BEING IN ARIZONA. 
WE HAVE BEEN HERE ALL DAY AND 
ALL NIGHT. 
IT IS GREAT TO BE IN THE GREAT 
STATE OF ARIZONA, WHERE 
THOUSANDS OF HARD-WORKING AND 
BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN PATRIOTS -- 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
IN JUST 18 DAYS THE PEOPLE OF 
ARIZONA ARE GOING TO SEND 
MARTHA McSALLY , A GREAT WOMAN, 
I WILL TELL YOU. 
I KNOW HER WELL, SHE IS A GREAT 
WOMAN, TO THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE TO PROTECT YOUR JOBS, 
DEFEND YOUR BORDERS, AND 
CONTINUE MAKING AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
AND REMEMBER, EARLY VOTING IN 
ARIZONA IS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW. 
IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE 
AND GO OUT AND VOTE, I DON'T 
MIND AT ALL. 
I SEE ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL RED 
HATS AND SOME WHITE ONES, RIGHT?
AND, SOME WHITE ONES. 
THE WHITE ONES ARE VERY NICE, 
THEY ARE GETTING SWAMPED BY THE 
RED. 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
BUT, WHAT IS THE NEW NAME? 
RIGHT? 
GO AHEAD -- IN ABOUT -- WHAT 
YOU THINK, ANOTHER 12 MONTHS, 
WE CAN ALMOST DO IT SOONER, 
RIGHT? 
WHAT DOES IT SAY? 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
RIGHT? 
WE HAVE GOT TO GET USED TO 
THAT, BECAUSE THERE IS 
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
IT JUST WORK. 
BUT, THAT IS TRUE. 
BECAUSE, EVERYTHING THAT WE DO, 
THEY CAN DESTROY VERY QUICKLY 
IF THE WRONG PEOPLE GET INTO 
OFFICE. 
AND THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TIME 
FOR OUR NATION. THE 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL TO 
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER 50 
YEARS. 
 
MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY
THAN AT ANY POINT IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THINK OF IT. 
THAT IS A BIG NUMBER. 
THAT IS A BIG STATISTIC. 
THINK OF THAT. 
TODAY, OR AMERICANSÃTHINK OF 
THAT, MORE AMERICANS ARE 
WORKING THE NEVER IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, TODAY, 
RIGHT NOW. 
NICE. 
NICE. 
AND HERE IN ARIZONA, 
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE SURGING 
AT THE FASTEST RATE IN MORE 
THAN TWO DECADES. 
REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 
HAVE ANY MANUFACTURING JOBS 
ANYMORE, RIGHT? 
I SAID YOU MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING 
TO MAKE THINGS ANYMORE? 
600,000 NEW MANUFACTURING -- 
WHERE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
VETERANS. 
AND, OUR MILITARY. 
IT WILL SOON BE MORE POWERFUL 
THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE. 
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP 
AMERICA IS BOOMING. 
AMERICA IS THRIVING, AND 
AMERICA IS WINNING, BECAUSE 
WE'RE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA 
FIRST. 
 
JUST LAST WEEK -- WE ACHIEVED 
ANOTHER HISTORIC VICTORY FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A 
BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, WE PROBABLY SWORE IN THE 
NEWEST MEMBER OF THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT, JUSTICE 
BRETT BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
 
THEY TREATED HIM BADLY. 
THEY TREATED HIM BADLY. 
WHAT THE RETICÃRADICAL 
DEMOCRATS DID. 
TWO JUSTICE KEVIN ON HIS FAMILY 
IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE, AND 
DON'T FORGET IT. 
DON'T FORGET IT. 
DON'T FORGET IT. 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME AN 
ANGRY, UNHINGED MOB, DETERMINED 
TO GET POWER BY ANY MEANS 
NECESSARY, YOUR VOTE IN THIS 
ELECTION WILL DECIDE WHICH 
PARTY CONTROLS CONGRESS. 
AND I WILL TELL YOU -- THEY'RE 
ALL TALKING ABOUT ARIZONA, AND 
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MARTHA 
McSALLY  AND THEY ARE ALL 
TALKING ABOUT ARIZONA. 
THE CHOICE FOR EVERY AMERICAN 
COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR THAN IT 
IS RIGHT NOW DEMOCRATS PRODUCE 
MOBS, REPUBLICANS PRODUCE JOBS. 
 
SO THIS NOVEMBER, WHEN YOU ARE 
VOTING, VOTE FOR THE JOBS, NOT 
FOR THE MOBS. 
JUST TO DO IT JUST TO DO IT. 
YOU KNOW, IT IS ALL VERY 
FRAGILE. 
IT CAN END VERY QUICKLY. 
EVEN SUPREME COURT -- WE PICKED 
TO, WE PICKED TWO. 
MANY PRESIDENTS NEVER PICK ANY. 
THAN EVER GET THAT GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY. 
THEY SAY IT IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT DECISION YOU CAN 
MAKE. 
I WOULD SAY WAR AND PEACE IS 
THE MOST -- BUT I WOULD SAY THE 
SECOND. 
BUT, IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO 
HAVE PICKED TO GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT? 
WE CAN PICK OTHERS BEFORE IT IS 
OVER AND BEFORE EVEN THE FIRST 
TERM, ALTHOUGH WE WILL HAVE 
EIGHT YEARS INSTEAD OF FOUR 
YEARS, BASED ON EVERYTHING -- 
BASED ON THE COMPETITION THAT 
WE SEE, YOU KNOW, WE CAN NO 
LONGER SAY POCAHONTAS, BECAUSE 
SHE HAS NO INDIAN BLOOD. 
WE CAN NO LONGER CALL HER 
POCAHONTAS. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO 
DO. 
WE WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH 
ANOTHER NAME FOR HER. 
ELIZABETH WARREN A VERY BORING 
NAME. 
WE WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH 
ANOTHER NAME. I CANNOT USE THE 
NAME POCAHONTAS ANYMORE. 
THERE IS NO INDIAN BLOOD. 
ALWAYS SAID -- I HAVE MORE 
INDIAN BLOOD THAN SHE HAS AND I 
HAVE NONE. 
I HAVE NONE. 
THAT IS MORE THAN SHE HAS. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
WE WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH 
ANOTHER NAME. 
IF NANCY PELOSI -- OR CRYING 
CHUCK SCHUMER AND THE RADICAL 
DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF 
CONGRESS ON NOVEMBER 6, THEY 
WILL TRY TO PLUNGE OUR COUNTRY 
INTO A NIGHTMARE OF GRIDLOCK, 
POVERTY AND CHAOS, YOU KNOW 
THAT. 
IT WILL BE A MESS. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES, IMPOSE SOCIALISM ON OUR 
COUNTRY, TURN US INTO A 
VENEZUELA. 
TURN US INTO ANOTHER VENEZUELA. 
TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE, 
DESTROY YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, 
AND DEMOCRATS WANT TO THROW 
YOUR BORDERS WIDE OPEN TO 
DEADLY DRUGS AND RUTHLESS 
GANGS, COME ON AND EVERYBODY. 
COME ON IN. 
COME ON IN EVERYBOY.  
WE ARE. 
THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 
WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL, ONE 
.6 MILLION, ANOTHER ONE .6 
MILLION. 
I WANT TO BUILD IT ALL AT ONE 
TIME, WE CAN DO IT IN ONE YEAR. 
AND, YOU SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. 
 
RIGHT NOW, AS YOU KNOW, MEXICO 
IS ON THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER, 
THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER. 
úAND, TH 
THEY ARE FIGHTING SOME BAD 
PEOPLE. 
AND LET YOU SEE THE PEOPLE, 
BUT, YOU LISTEN TO THE FAKE 
NEWS BACK THERE AND YOU THINK 
THEY ARE ALL -- YOU THINK THEY 
ARE ALL WONDERFUL PEOPLE. 
RIGHT? 
NO, NO.  
YOU THINKÃI'M SERIOUS, YOU 
THINK THEY ARE ALL WONDERFUL 
PEOPLE. 
YOU'VE GOT SOME BAD PEOPLE IN 
THOSE GROUPS. 
YOU HAVE SOME TOUGH PEOPLE IN 
THOSE GROUPS. 
AND, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. 
THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT WANT 
THEM. 
OKAY? 
WE DO NOT WANT THEM. 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE PARTY 
OF CRIME. 
IT WILL BE THE ELECTION OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH , THE CARAVAN, 
LAW AND ORDER, TAX CUTS -- WE 
FORGET ABOUT TAX CUTS ALL THE 
TIME. 
AND COMMON SENSE. BUT, WE 
FORGET ABOUT TAX CUTS. 
WE GIVE YOU THE BIGGEST TAX CUT 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
 
AND I TELL FRIENDS OF MINE THAT 
ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, WE HAVE 
TO STOP BRINGING UP TAX CUTS IT 
IS ALMOST LIKE -- WE JUST DID 
IT, AND WE ALSO GOT RID OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR -- WHERE YOU HAVE THE 
PRIVILEGE OF PAYING A FORTUNE 
FOR HAVING A SECOND PRIVILEGE 
OF GETTING BAD HEALTHCARE ALSO 
FOR A FORTUNE. 
NO, THAT IS NO GOOD. 
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE. 
YOU KNOW ANOTHER THING WE DID 
FOR -- LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
ARIZONA -- SMALL BUSINESS, 
FARMERS, YOU DO NOT HAVE ESTATE 
TAX, NO MORE ESTATE TAX. 
SO, IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, 
WHICH IS A QUESTION, YOU MAY 
NOT LIKE THEM, IN THIS CASE, DO 
NOT LISTEN TO ME. 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM, DON'T 
LEAVE THEM THE FARM, BUT IF YOU 
LOVE THEM, YOU WILL LOVE TRUMP, 
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY 
ESTATE TAX. 
THAT IS A BIG THING. 
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE DO 
NOT HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT. 
AND, I GOT A LOT FOR YOU. 
I LOVE YOU TOO, THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
I LOVE YOU TOO. 
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS BECOME 
TOO EXTREME AND TOO DANGEROUS 
TO BE TRUSTED WITH POWER. 
IF YOU WANT TO DRAIN THE SWAMP, 
YOU MUST DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS. 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 
 
SO, VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN IN 
ARIZONA. 
MANY OF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR 
BALANCE, RETURNED THEM TODAY. 
RETURN THEM TOMORROW. 
GO-AHEAD. 
GET THEM IN. 
VOTE EARLY, IT IS ALL RIGHT. 
BUT, YOU HAVE TO VOTE ON 
NOVEMBER 6. AND, BY THE WAY, 
THE EARLY VOTING SHOWS THAT 
MARTHA IS PRETTY MUCH AHEAD. 
WE ARE WAY AHEAD OF WHERE REAL 
ÃWERE EARLIER. 
DON'T GET COMPLACENT. 
REMEMBER THIS -- FOR WHATEVER 
REASON, THE PARTY THAT WINS THE 
PRESIDENCY ALMOST ALWAYS LOSES 
IN THE MIDTERM, I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT. 
NOW, THEY 
WE PROBABLY HAVE THE GREATEST 
ECONOMY IN HISTORY. 
WHAT HAPPENS?  
THEY LOSE THE MIDTERM AND THEN 
THEY GO ON TO CRUSH IN 2020. 
I WANT TO WIN THIS AND THAT. 
TONIGHT, WE ARE THRILLED TO BE 
JOINED BY SEVERAL TERRIFIC 
ARIZONA REPUBLICANS INCLUDING 
REPRESENTATIVES DEBBIE LESKO -- 
WHERE IS SHE?  
GOOD. 
DID A GOOD JOB. 
SHE WAS VERY TOUGH. 
GREAT JOB, DEBBIE. 
A MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN THEIR HAS 
BEEN FIGHTING ME DAY IN AND DAY 
OUT. 
HE IS A WINNER. 
HE LOVES HIS STATE AND HIS 
COUNTRY. 
I WATCHED HIM THIS MORNING. 
I HEARD HE WAS ON SO I WANTED 
TO TURN IT ON AND I WANTED TO 
WATCH CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGGS 
AND HE DID A GREAT JOB. 
>>  
THANK YOU. 
GREAT JOB. 
AND A MAN THAT WE ALL LOVE AND 
HE IS SOLID. 
HE HELPED US WITH HEALTHCARE 
AND WITH EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF 
WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
TAX CUTS, BORDERS. 
HE IS TOUGH. 
HE IS SMART. 
YOU LOVE HIM. 
DAVE SCHWEIKERT. 
THANK YOU, DAVE. 
GREAT JOB. 
>>> WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY DOUG 
DUCEY. 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. 
DOUG IS FANTASTIC.  
AND YOUR NEXT UNITED STATES 
SENATOR MOTHER AND -- MARLON 
MACK SALLY. 
-- MARTHA MAKE SALLY -- 
MARTHA McSALLY.  
>>  
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO ARIZONA.
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW WE ARE 
NOT CRAZY HERE. 
UNLIKE WHAT MY OPPONENT SAYS, 
WE ARE NOT A METH LAB OF 
DEMOCRACY. 
ISN'T THAT RIDICULOUS?  
ARIZONA'S AN AMAZING STATE AND 
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE. 
I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR 
SUPPORT. 
ARIZONA AND AMERICA ARE BACK 
THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
AND DOUG DUCEY. 
AND THE REPUBLICAN SENATE AND 
HOUSE. 
WE SEE SO MUCH OPTIMISM. 
WE HAVE SO MANY JOB 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY 
AND SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS. 
WE HAVE JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
ON THE BENCH. 
BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO 
DO. 
IT IS SO HIGH-STAKES IN THIS 
ELECTION. 
WE ARE DOWN TO THE WIRE TO MAKE 
SURE WE KEEP AND GROW THE 
SENATE MAJORITY. 
THE CONTRAST COULD NOT BE MORE 
CLEAR. 
I SAID I WOULD VOTE FOR 
KAVANAUGH. 
CINNAMON SAYS SHE WOULD VOTE NO.
ON NATIONAL SECURITY, I 
ADVOCATED AND WE FOUGHT AND 
KEPT THE A-10 WARTHOG. 
AND SCINEMA ADVOCATED TO SHUT 
DOWN LUKE AIR FORCE BASE.  
YOU CAN SEE WHAT A TREASURE IT 
IS. 
I WAS SHOOTING AT THE TALIBAN 
AND SCINEMA  SAYS IT'S OKAY FOR 
AN AMERICAN TO JOIN THE 
TALIBAN. 
WHAT THE HILL?  
RIGHT?  
I WAS WEARING A FLIGHT SUIT AND 
SHE WAS WEARING A PINK TUTU. 
OUR ECONOMIC SECURITY YOU KNOW 
I VOTED FOR YOUR TAX CUTS AND 
SHE VOTED NO. 
MOST IMPORTANTLY ON BORDER 
SECURITY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IT'S 
BEEN AN HONOR TO BE LEADING IN 
THE HOUSE TO MAKE SURE WE BUILD 
THE WALL. 
>>  
>>  BUILD THE 
WALL. 
>> EXACTLY. 
WE HAVE TO DO IT. 
WE'VE GOT TO CLOSE THESE CRAZY 
LOOPHOLES. 
MY LEGISLATION CLOSES THESE 
LOOPHOLES. 
WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO. 
MY OPPONENT AND HER ALLIES, 
CHUCK SCHUMER, THEY ARE SO 
DANGEROUS ON THESE ISSUES. 
SINEMA VOTED TO PROTECT 
SANCTUARY CITIES.  
YEAH. 
THIS IS PERSONAL. 
IN THE AUDIENCE IS MARIANNE 
MENDOZA AND HER SON BRIAN. 
A MESA SERGEANT FROM THE MESA 
POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS KILLED BY 
A MAN WHO DIDN'T BELONG HERE 
AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN GONE. 
THIS IS PERSONAL FOR MARIANNE 
AND FOR US IN ARIZONA. 
WE HAVE TO CRACK DOWN ON 
SANCTUARY CITIES AND MS-13 
GANGS, BUILD A WALL AND SECURE 
THE BORDER. 
THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. 
I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT 
AND YOUR VOTE. 
GOD BLESS YOU ALL. 
GOD BLESS ARIZONA. 
GOD BLESS AMERICA. 
THANK YOU. 
>> 
>> THAT'S FANTASTIC. 
A GREAT VETERAN. 
A GREAT WARRIOR. 
THE 1st PILOT TO FIGHT COMBAT 
MISSIONS. I SPOKE TO SOME OF 
THE PILOTS AND FIGHTERS. 
WE JUST LEFT. 
WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE DISPLAY OF 
TALENT. 
BOEING WAS THERE. 
RAYTHEON WAS THERE. 
THEY WERE ALL THERE. 
THEY WERE VERY IMPRESSED. 
YOU DESERVE SOMEONE WHO DESERVES
TO FIGHT FOR THIS STATE, WHO 
WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN AND 
THAT IS MARTHA McSALLY. 
AND MARTHA'S OPPONENT IS A FAR 
LEFT EXTREMIST NAMED KYRSTEN 
SINEMA AND YOU KNOW SHE IS. 
SHE IS BEING PROTECTED BY THE 
FAKE NEWS BACK THERE. 
>>  
>> LOOK AT THAT. 
IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS. 
LOOK AT THIS. 
THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF. 
YOU THINK THIS HAPPENS TO THE 
AVERAGE PRESIDENT?  
NO WAY. 
I HOPE YOU ARE ENJOYING 
YOURSELVES. 
YOU CAN TURN THE CAMERAS BACK 
ON. 
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING BAD. 
WHEN THEY THINK I AM READY TO 
SAY SOMETHING BAD, ALL THOSE 
RED LIGHTS GO OFF. 
I AM GOING TO LEAVE YOU ALONE. 
AFTER 9/11, MARTHA McSALLY 
HEROICALLY LED AIRSTRIKES 
AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIST 
TERRORISTS. 
VERY SUCCESSFUL. 
BUT WHILE MARTHA WAS BRAVELY 
FIGHTING THE TALIBAN, KYRSTEN 
SINEMA SAID SHE HAD NO PROBLEM 
WITH AMERICANS DEFECTING FROM 
OUR COUNTRY TO JOIN THE 
TALIBAN. 
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?  
>>  
>> SERIOUSLY, HOW DOES THAT 
HAPPEN IN ARIZONA?  
SHE MADE THESE COMMENTS EVEN AS 
COURAGEOUS AMERICAN 
SERVICEMEMBERS WERE GIVING 
THEIR LIVES IN THE FIGHT 
AGAINST ENEMY TALIBAN FORCES. 
KYRSTEN SINEMA ALSO EMBRACED A 
LEFT-WING RADICAL WHO WAS 
CONVICTED OF PROVIDING MATERIAL 
SUPPORT TO TERRORISTS. 
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT AS YOUR 
SENATOR?  
I DON'T THINK SO. 
AS YOU KNOW KYRSTEN SINEMA 
VOTED STRONGLY AGAINST TAX CUTS 
NOT BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT 
BUT BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI TOLD 
HER TO DO THAT. 
AND MAXINE WATERS TOLD HER TO 
DO IT TOO. 
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT BUT 
THEY TOLD HER TO DO IT. 
SHE WILL DO WHATEVER THEY TELL 
HER. 
SHE VOTED FOR OBAMAS AMNESTY 
AND VOTED AGAINST THE BORDER 
WALL. 
SHE WANTS TO LET POISONOUS 
DRUGS POUR INTO YOUR 
COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHERE 
THEY ARE COMING RIGHT THROUGH. 
SHE VOTED TO SUPPORT DEADLY 
SANCTUARY CITIES AND SINEMA 
JOINED A SINFUL DEMOCRAT MOB  
ATTACKING THE GREAT JUSTICE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
HE WILL BE A GREAT SUPREME 
COURT JUDGE. 
>>  AND 
A VOTE FOR KYRSTEN SINEMA IS A 
WASTED VOTE BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY A DANGEROUS VOTE 
BECAUSE IT'S FOR CHUCK, POLICY 
AND MAXINE WATERS. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT RADICAL 
DEMOCRATIC MOBS TO CONTINUE TO 
-- TO CONTROL CONGRESS, GET OUT 
AND VOTE. 
VOTE FOR MARTHA McSALLY. 
IT WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST 
VOTES YOU HAVE EVER CARRIED. 
IT WILL BE THE SECOND GREATEST 
BOAT YOU EVER CAST. THE FIRST 
GREATEST BOAT WAS FOR ME. 
WHEN YOU CAST A VOTE FOR ME, 
YOU CAST A VOTE FOR YOU TOO. 
THEY NEVER QUESTIONED ME ON 
THIS BUT I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST MOVEMENT 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. 
WE ARE DOING GREAT. 
THE GREATEST PRESIDENT. 
I LIKE HIM. 
WHO SAID THAT?  
THANK YOU. 
WE ARE WORKING HARD. 
WE ARE WORKING HARD. 
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE 
ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR A 
SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE
THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE 
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE OF 3.4 
MILLION ARIZONA RESIDENTS. 
YOUR TAXES WILL BE TRIPLED. 
THE DEMOCRAT PLAN WOULD DESTROY 
MEDICARE AND TERMINATE MEDICARE 
ADVANTAGE FOR OVER HALF 1 
MILLION ARIZONA SENIORS WHO 
DEPEND ON IT. 
DEMOCRATS PUT TO MEDICARE 
ADVANTAGE -- PLAN TO MEDICARE 
ADVANTAGE IS REALLY UNFAIR TO 
HISPANIC AMERICANS. 
WE HAVE A COUPLE IN THE ROOM 
DON'T WE?  
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL WITH 
HISPANIC AMERICANS. 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?  
THEY WANT SAFETY AT THE BORDER. 
THEY WANT GREAT JOBS.. 
REMEMBER LAST ELECTION, HE 
WON'T DO WELL WITH THE HISPANIC 
VOTE. 
DID WE DO WELL OR WHAT?  
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE 
IT OUT. 
THEY SAID HE WON'T DO WELL WITH 
WOMEN. 
DID WE DO WELL WITH WOMEN?  
THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET 
BUT THEY ARE TRYING. 
DO YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY THIS 
GAME? 
YOU WANT TO CONTINUE PLAYING 
THIS GAME? 
ONE OUT OF EVERY TWO HISPANIC 
SENIORS IS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE 
ADVANTAGE, WHICH THEY ARE GOING 
TO DESTROY. 
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT 
MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS WHO 
HAVE EARNED IT AND PAID FOR IT. 
AND REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS 
PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-
EXISTING CONDITIONS. 
THEY ARE TRYING TO PUT A FALSE 
NARRATIVE OUT THERE. 
IF THERE IS A REPUBLICAN OUT 
THERE THAT DOESN'T, LET ME 
KNOW. 
BELIEVE ME, WE WILL TALK HIM 
INTO IT. 
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT PRE-
EXISTING CONDITIONS. 
PUT IT DOWN. 
REMEMBER DURING THE DEBATES, 
EVERYONE WANTED TO READJUST 
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, AND SOME 
YEARS ON. 
LISTEN, WHO WAS THE ONE PERSON 
WHO SAID I AM NOT TOUCHING 
ENTITLEMENTS?  
THANK YOU. 
AND REMEMBER, I SAID THAT AND I 
HAVEN'T. 
A LOT OF PRESIDENTS HAVE MADE 
BIG PROMISES. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEIR CAREER 
IS OVER. 
YOU HAVE WATCHED IT. 
IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT WHEN IT 
HAPPENS. 
IT'S NOT PRETTY AT ALL. 
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME BUT I 
WAS ON STAGE DURING ALL THOSE 
DEBATES, WHICH WE WON BY THE 
WAY, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, 
BUT I WAS ON STAGE WITH ALL 
THOSE DEBATES, FIRST WITH SOME 
REALLY FINE PEOPLE, THE 
REPUBLICANS. 
AND THEN WITH A VERY DISHONEST 
PERSON, CROOKED HILLARY 
CLINTON. 
>>  
>> AND DURING THAT TIME -- 
>>  [ CROWD CHANTING 
] LOCK HER UP. 
LOCK HER UP. 
LOCK HER UP. 
LOCK HER UP. 
>> IT IS AMAZING HOW YOU CAN 
DELETE 33,000 EMAILS AFTER 
GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM THE 
UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND OUR 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 
IT IS PRETTY AMAZING. 
>>  
>> OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
HEADED BY MANY PEOPLE FROM THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. 
CAN'T WIN THEM ALL BUT IT WILL 
ALL WORK OUT. 
JUST LIKE YOU LOOK AT WHAT 
WE'VE DONE. 
YOU WILL GET EVERY DEPARTMENT. 
YOU LOOK AT SECRETARY OF STATE. 
EPA. 
YOU LOOK AT EVERYONE, WE ARE 
DOING SO WELL. 
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RADICAL 
SOCIALISM AND OPEN BORDERS. 
AS WE SPEAK, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY 
IS OPENLY INVITING MILLIONS OF 
ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BREAK OUR 
LAWS, VIOLATE OUR BORDERS, AND 
OVERWHELM OUR NATION. 
>>  
>> OTHER THAN THAT, THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE DOING A GREAT 
JOB, RIGHT?  
NOT TOO GOOD. 
THEY HAVE LOUSY POLITICIANS, 
HORRIBLE POLICY BUT THEY DO ONE 
THING WELL. 
THEY STICK TOGETHER. 
THEY REALLY DO. 
THEY STICK TOGETHER BETTER THAN 
THE REPUBLICANS. 
THE ONE THING THEY DO, AND THEY 
STICK, THEY DON'T WANT US TO 
HAVE THE VICTORY OF A WALL EVEN 
THOUGH WE THAT MUCH MORE MONEY 
FOR OUR MILITARY. 
MANY TIMES MORE. 
BUT THEY DON'T WANT US TO HAVE 
THE WALL. 
EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW IT'S THE 
RIGHT THING, THEY WILL FIGHT TO 
THE DEATH BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
WANT US TO HAVE A WALL BUT WE 
STARTED THE WELL ANYWAY AND 
WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT DONE. 
WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT DONE. 
>>  
>> AND NOW, IT'S AT THE POINT, 
IT IS REALLY AT A POINT WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS POURING 
OVER IN THESE CARAVANS WHEN 
THEY START SAYING WE DON'T WANT 
TO CHANGE THOSE IMMIGRATION 
LAWS, CATCH AND RELEASE. 
WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE VISA 
LOTTERY. 
THINK OF VISA LOTTERY. 
THEY PICK NAMES OUT OF A HAT. 
THINK ABOUT IT. 
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS COUNTRY, 
WHICHEVER COUNTRY IT IS, ARE 
THEY GOING TO PUT THEIR FINEST 
IN?  
I DON'T THINK SO. 
CHAIN MIGRATION. 
YOU COME OVER. 
WE HAD A GUY ON THE WEST SIDE 
HIGHWAY. 
HE GOES DOWN THE HIGHWAY. 
HE IS GOING 60-70 MILES-PER-
HOUR. 
RADICAL ISLAM. 
TERRIBLE. 
MAKES A RIGHT TURN INTO A PARK, 
KILLS NINE PEOPLE, BADLY 
INJURES -- NOBODY EVER TALKS 
ABOUT IT. 
PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING ALONG 
THE BEAUTIFUL HUDSON RIVER 
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY IN 
SHAPE, THEY ENDED UP GOING HOME 
SIX MONTHS LATER WITH NO LEGS 
OR ARMS. 
BECAUSE OF SICK PEOPLE LIKE 
THIS. 
THESE ARE SICK PEOPLE. 
THIS GUY HAD 22 PEOPLE. 
HE BROUGHT IN HIS MOTHER, HIS 
FATHER, HIS BROTHER, HIS 
SISTERS. 
HIS AUNTS AND UNCLES. 
>>  
>> BECAUSE OF DEMOCRAT POLICY. 
THAT'S CALLED CHAIN MIGRATION. 
IT SOUNDS SO GOOD LIKE RIGHT 
OUT OF SCHOOL. 
IT SOUNDS SO BEAUTIFUL. 
THE CHAIN, EVERYONE COMES 
TOGETHER. 
NOPE. 
WE ARE ENDING IT, FOLKS. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO 
DO IT BUT WE ARE ENDING IT. 
>>  
>> AND CATCH AND RELEASE. 
HOW ABOUT THAT?  
THAT'S MY FAVORITE. 
>>  
>> CATCH. 
YOU CATCH A KILLER, A BAD HOMBRE
. YOU CATCH A BAD ONE, YOU TAKE 
THE NAME, AND WE ARE SUPPOSED 
TO BRING THEM TO COURT, BUT WE 
HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT. 
YOU KNOW WHY?  
BECAUSE WE, I, YOU, ALTOGETHER 
WE HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY SO 
STRONG ECONOMICALLY, SO GOOD. 
JOBS, EVERYTHING, THAT 
EVERYBODY WANTS TO COME IN SO 
IT'S MY FAULT, BUT WE'RE NOT 
LETTING THEM IN. 
WE ARE ONLY GOING TO LET PEOPLE 
IN BASED ON MERIT. 
WE NEED PEOPLE TO COME IN BASED 
ON MERIT. 
>>  
THEY PUT ONE FOOT DOWN. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE, 
I.C.E. 
BORDER PATROL, LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
>> . 
THE LAW DOESN'T ALLOW US TO 
THROW THEM OUT. 
WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM, WRITE 
THEM UP AND THEN SAY COME BACK 
IN THREE YEARS FOR A COURT CASE 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME THEY ARE 
RELEASED INTO OUR SOCIETY. 
THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT 
COME BACK FOR THE CASE?  
3%. 
HE HAD -- HE SAID ZERO. 
SLIGHTLY OFF. 
3% SHOW UP THREE YEARS, FIVE 
YEARS LATER. 
IT'S A DISGRACE. 
THE DEMOCRATS DO IT. 
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES. 
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
REPUBLICANS TO OVERRIDE BECAUSE 
THEY DO STICK TOGETHER. 
THEY ARE ONLY STICKING TOGETHER 
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE 
WE DON'T GET WHAT THEY KNOW OUR 
COUNTRY NEEDS. 
BUT I THINK THEY MAY BE FORCED 
POLITICALLY TO DO IT. 
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU ANYBODY 
THAT WAS FOR A DEMOCRAT NOW IS 
CRAZY. 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CRAZY. 
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ABOUT 
WHAT THEY ARE EXTREMIST 
IMMIGRANT AGENDA WILL DO TO 
YOUR COMMUNITIES, YOUR 
HOSPITALS. 
HOW ABOUT YOUR HOSPITALS?  
THEY ARE BEING OVERRUN. 
YOUR SCHOOLS, CALIFORNIA. 
THEY WANT TO GIVE YOU FREE 
EDUCATION, FREE HEALTHCARE, 
OPEN BORDERS. 
I MEAN, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 10 
MILLION PEOPLE MOVE TO 
CALIFORNIA. 
THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING. 
LET'S GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF 
THERE. 
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. 
THEY ARE CUCKOO. 
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE THAT A 
FLOOD OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS 
GOING TO TOTALLY BANKRUPT OUR 
COUNTRY. 
BECAUSE ALL THE DEMOCRATS WANT 
IS POWER. 
DON'T FORGET, EVERYBODY THAT 
COMES ACROSS THE BORDER FOR THE 
MOST PART WILL VOTE DEMOCRAT, 
NOT REPUBLICAN. 
SO NOBODY SAID THEY ARE STUPID 
BUT IT'S BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE DEMOCRAT 
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. 
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT. 
THAT IS WHY DEMOCRATS SUPPORT 
PROGRAMS LIKE CATCH AND RELEASE.
THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS FREE WELFARE
AND FREE HEALTHCARE, AND FREE 
EDUCATION. 
GIVE THEM A DRIVER'S LICENSE. 
GIVE THEM A DRIVER'S LICENSE. 
NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY WANT 
TO BUY HIM A CAR. 
THEN THEY WILL SAY THE CAR IS 
NOT GOOD ENOUGH. 
HOW ABOUT A ROLLS-ROYCE?  
MADE NOT IN AMERICA SO I HOPE 
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO. 
THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
GIVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE 
RIGHT TO VOTE. 
>>  
>> HOW ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA 
WHERE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TOOK 
OVER THE TOWN COUNCIL AND NOW 
THE TOWN COUNCIL IS RUN BY 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE TOWN. 
IS THIS EVEN BELIEVABLE?  
IT'S SICK. 
THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
ABOLISH I.C.E., THE MOST BRAVE 
PEOPLE. 
THESE PEOPLE, I WOULDN'T WANT 
THEIR JOB. 
NOBODY APPEAR WANTS THEIR JOB. 
THEY GO INTO THE TOUGHEST 
SITUATIONS. 
WE CALL THEM NESTS, WHICH ARE 
VERY BAD PEOPLE. 
THEY DON'T LIKE USING GUNS. 
THEY WOULD RATHER USE KNIVES 
BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL AND SLOWER.
THESE ARE REALLY BAD PEOPLE. 
I.C.E. 
GOES IN AND IT'S LIKE A DAY AT 
THE OFFICE. 
NO PROBLEM. 
THEY FREE TOWNS LIKE IN LONG 
ISLAND. 
THEY LIBERATE TOWNS. 
IT'S LIKE LIBERATION FROM A 
WAR. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS THINK I.C.E. 
ISN'T NICE. 
WE CHERISH I.C.E. 
AND BORDER PATROL. 
WE CHERISH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
>>  
>> THE CASUALTIES INTO THE OPEN 
BORDERS CRUSADE ARE INNOCENT 
AMERICAN FAMILIES AND LIVES. 
WE HAVE SOME OF THESE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WITH US 
TONIGHT. 
DEMOCRAT IMMIGRATION POLICIES 
ALLOW POISONOUS DRUGS, VICIOUS 
BEEN MEMBERS AND MS-13 KILLERS 
TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE REMOVED THOUSANDS OF MS-
13. 
GET THEM THE HILL OUT. 
-- GET THEM THE OUT.  
DEMOCRATS RELEASED PREDATORS 
AND TO YOUR COMMUNITIES. 
YOU DON'T WANT IT. 
A DEMOCRAT VICTORY IN NOVEMBER 
WOULD BE A BRIGHT, FLASHING 
INVITATION TO EVERY TRAFFICKER, 
SMUGGLER, DRUG DEALER, AND 
ILLEGAL ALIEN ON THE PLANET. 
A REPUBLICAN VICTORY WOULD SEND 
THE MESSAGE THAT AMERICA WILL 
ENFORCE OUR BORDERS AND DEFEND 
OUR CITIZENS. 
IN NOVEMBER, THIS IS YOUR REAL 
CHOICE. 
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A CHOICE 
BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT. 
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A 
CHOICE, OKAY?  
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE ILLEGAL 
BORDER CROSSERS SHOULD BE 
IMMEDIATELY SET FREE. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE ILLEGAL 
BORDER CROSSERS SHOULD BE 
IMMEDIATELY SENT HOME OR IF 
THEY ARE CRIMINALS PUT IN JAIL. 
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY 
SHOULD BE A GIANT SANCTUARY 
CITY FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. 
THEY WANT IT TO BE A BIG, FAT, 
BEAUTIFUL SANCTUARY CITY. 
THE WHOLE COUNTRY FOR CRIMINAL 
ALIENS. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY 
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-
ABIDING AMERICANS. 
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE AMERICAN 
TAXPAYERS SHOULD PROVIDE FREE 
WELFARE TO ILLEGALS. 
THAT'S WONDERFUL. 
>>  
>> HOW ABOUT CALIFORNIA?  
THEY OWE ABOUT $2 TRILLION. 
THEY OWE MORE MONEY THAN ANY 
PLACE HAS EVER EVEN DREAMT OF. 
AND NOW THEY HAVE A MAN RUNNING 
FOR GOVERNOR WHO WANTS TO 
ACTUALLY LET THE ENTIRE WORLD 
POUR INTO HIS STATE GIVING THEM 
FREE WELFARE, FREE EDUCATION, 
FREE LICENSES, FREE EVERYTHING 
AND THEY HAVE NO MONEY. 
THEY HAVE NO MONEY AND THEY OWE 
A FORTUNE. 
OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A GREAT 
IDEA. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE WELFARE 
SHOULD BE PROTECTED FOR TRULY 
NEEDY AMERICANS. 
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR 
COUNTRY AND PROTECT YOUR 
FAMILY. 
IF YOU WANT TO EMERICH -- HONOR 
AMERICAN LAWS, THE BORDERS, THE 
SOVEREIGNTY, THE DIGNITY THAT 
YOU MUST VOTE -- THEN YOU MUST 
VOTE FOR MARTHA AND REPUBLICANS 
ON NOVEMBER 6. 
>>  
>> THIS ELECTION IS ALSO ABOUT 
PROSPERITY. 
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS WE HAVE 
CREATED OVER 4.2 MILLION NEW 
JOBS AND LIFTED OVER 4 MILLION 
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 
THINK OF THAT. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD 
INCOME IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. 
WHO IS A HISPANIC AMERICAN IN 
THIS ROOM?  
10%?  
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. 
DO YOU LIKE TRUMP?  
IT'S ALWAYS DANGEROUS. 
ALWAYS DANGEROUS. 
>>  TRUMP 
TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP. 
>> THANK YOU. 
 
>> HISPANIC AMERICAN POVERTY 
HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME 
HISTORIC LOW. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE 
EVER RECORDED IN HISTORY. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND ASIAN 
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE 
REACHED THEIR LOWEST RATES EVER 
RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
>>  
>> AND WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT AT 
3.6% IS THE LOWEST IT HAS BEEN 
IN 65 YEARS. 
EVERYDAY, WE ARE LIVING BY OUR 
MOTTO PROMISES MADE, PROMISES 
KEPT. 
SOME OF THE FAKE NEWS, AND THEY 
KNOW IT, THEY SAY THAT I HAVE 
MADE PROMISES AND I ACTUALLY 
KEPT MORE PROMISES THAT I MADE. 
I THINK WE HAVE DONE MORE THAN 
THE EVEN SAID. 
AND WE ARE NOT FINISHED. 
WE ARE NOT FINISHED YET. 
WE ARE NOT FINISHED. 
TWO WEEKS AGO, I ANNOUNCED WE 
ARE REPLACING THE HORRIBLE, 
DISGUSTING, TERRIBLE, NAFTA 
DEAL. 
WITH AN INCREDIBLE, BRAND-NEW 
NEW YORK -- MEXICO-CANADA-U.S. 
AGREEMENT. 
EVEN THE DEMOCRATS LIKE IT. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?  
CHUCK SCHUMER ACTUALLY SAID 
REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?  
IT WILL BE APPROVED PRETTY 
QUICKLY. 
THAT OPENS UP CANADA AND MEXICO 
TO THE FARMERS AND TWO 
MANUFACTURERS. 
IT'S A GREAT THING HOPEFULLY 
FOR ALL THREE COUNTRIES BUT 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT 
DEAL. 
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER. 
WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST EVER 
ACTION TO CRACK DOWN ON CHINA'S 
HIGHLY ABUSIVE TRADE PRACTICE. 
AND WE ARE WINNING. 
AND REPUBLICANS PAST THE 
BIGGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND 
TAX REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY 
INCLUDING ALASKA. 
THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED THE 
BIGGEST SITE DRILLING JUST 
ABOUT IN THE WORLD. 
PRESIDENT REAGAN REALLY TRIED. 
AND GET IT DONE. 
FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH 
ALL OF THEM, I GOT IT DONE. 
THE PEOPLE IN ALASKA LIKE ME. 
MY GRANDFATHER WAS LOOKING FOR 
GOLD. 
IT WASN'T EASY TO FIND BUT HE 
WAS LOOKING. 
WE ALSO PASSED VETERANS CHOICE 
FOR GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND THE LANDMARK VA 
ACCOUNTABILITY LAW TO ENSURE 
ANYONE WHO MISTREATS OR HURTS 
OUR VETERANS IN ANY WAY IS 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
WE LOOK AT THEM AND WE SAY JIM, 
SORRY TO DO THIS BUT YOU ARE 
FIRED. 
GET OUT OF HERE. 
>>  
>> YOU COULDN'T FIRE HIM. 
WE WERE STUCK. 
WE SECURED $700 BILLION AND 
THEN NEXT YEAR, $716 BILLION TO 
FULLY REBUILD OUR GREAT 
AMERICAN MILITARY. 
AND OUR MILITARY WILL VERY 
SHORTLY BE FAR STRONGER, FAR 
MORE POWERFUL AND MODERN, THE 
BEST IN THE WORLD. 
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
MILITARY, I DON'T CARE ABOUT 
THE JOBS SO MUCH. 
BUT AS A SECONDARY BENEFIT, 
EVERY OUNCE OF IT IS BUILT IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
WE MAKE THE BEST PLANES, THE 
BEST SHIPS, THE BEST ROCKETS 
AND MISSILES. 
WE MAKE THE BEST. 
IT'S A LOT OF JOBS. 
WE WILL SOON HAVE FIND A WAY 
THE STRONGEST MILITARY THAT WE 
HAVE EVER HAD AND HOPEFULLY, 
YOU KNOW WHAT?  
IT WILL BE SO STRONG AND SO 
POWERFUL THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO 
USE IT. 
>>  
>> IF IT WASN'T POWERFUL, WE 
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO USE IT. 
THE PENTAGON IS NOW WORKING TO 
CREATE A SIXTH BRANCH OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES CALLED 
THE SPACE FORCE. 
VERY SERIOUS. 
>>  
>> I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 
AND YOU REMEMBER THE DAY BEFORE 
I CAME INTO OFFICE, IT LOOKED 
LIKE IRAN WAS JUST GOING TO 
TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE EAST. 
THERE WAS NO STOPPING THEM. 
GUESS WHAT?  
THEY ARE REALLY STRUGGLING 
RIGHT NOW. 
THEY ARE HAVING RIOTS EVERY 
WEEKEND. 
THEY ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. 
THEY ARE HAVING A HARD TIME AND 
WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE CAPITAL 
OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE 
EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
>>  
>> TOGETHER, WE HAVE MADE 
EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS. 
THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IS 
I THINK UNPARALLELED CERTAINLY 
FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND 
WE'RE STILL QUITE A BIT SHIRT --
QUITE A BIT SHORT. 
WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. 
JANUARY 20. 
BUT NOBODY HAS DONE MORE THAN 
WE HAVE DONE IN THE 1st TWO 
YEARS NOT EVEN CLOSE. 
WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. 
IF YOU VOTE TO ELECT A 
REPUBLICAN HOUSE IN THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATE, WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO CUT YOUR TAXES, CUT 
YOUR REGULATIONS AND RAISE YOUR 
INCOMES. 
WE WILL PROTECT MEDICARE AND 
SOCIAL SECURITY. 
>>  
>> AND DEMOCRATS WILL DESTROY 
THEM BOTH AND YOU KNOW IT. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONFIRM 
JUDGES WHO INTERPRET OUR 
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. 
WE WILL SECURE THE BORDER. 
WE WILL PASS K'S LAW. 
-- KATES LAW. 
WE WILL END SANCTUARY CITIES. 
STOP CATCH AND RELEASE, VISA 
LOTTERY, CHAIN MIGRATION. 
WE WILL KEEP THE CRIMINALS, 
DRUG DEALERS AND TERRORISTS OUT 
OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS OF OUR 
CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK 
AND POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. 
FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOU 
ARE LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR 
AMERICA, RIGHT?  
REMEMBER?  
REMEMBER ALL THE BOWING?  
PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT IT. 
I REMEMBER. 
I DIDN'T LIKE IT. 
ALL THE BOWING. 
NOW, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO 
IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF ARIZONA. 
WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP FOR 
OUR GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
>>  
>> BUT TO CONTINUE THIS 
INCREDIBLE MOMENTUM TO DEFEND 
YOUR STATE AND YOUR COUNTRY, I 
NEED YOU TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, 
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR NEIGHBORS, 
YOUR COWORKERS, AND GET OUT AND 
VOTE FOR MARTHA McSALLY 
NOVEMBER 6 -- NOVEMBER 6. BUT 
VOTE EARLY. 
MARTHA IS A COURAGEOUS FIGHTER. 
SHE IS THE PERSON YOU NEED IN 
WASHINGTON. 
YOU WILL BE SO PROUD OF HER. 
SHE LOVES THIS STATE SO MUCH. 
SERIOUSLY, YOU WILL BE SO PROUD 
OF HER. 
SHE SAID I'M PROUD OF YOU, TOO. 
THANK YOU. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
PEOPLE SAY THIS WILL BE AN EASY 
JOB. 
NOTHING EASY ABOUT IT BUT WE 
LOVE IT. 
YOU KNOW WHY?  
THEY JUST ASKED ME RECENTLY, DO 
YOU LIKE IT?  
IT'S HARD. 
I SAY IT'S ONLY HARD BECAUSE I 
CHOOSE TO WORK 24 HOURS A DAY. 
I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. 
YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE IT?  
BECAUSE WE ARE ACCOMPLISHING SO 
MUCH MORE THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT. 
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVING US CREDIT 
FOR US. 
A VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS
IS A VOTE FOR MORE JOBS, MORE 
WEALTH, AND MORE PRODUCTS MADE 
RIGHT HERE IN THE USA. 
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. 
REMEMBER?  
IT'S A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR LAWS 
AND RESPECT THE HEROES OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE TO DENY THE DEMOCRAT 
POLITICS OF HATRED AND DIVISION,
AND CELEBRATE THE GREATNESS AND 
THE GLORY OF BEING AN AMERICAN. 
IT IS GREAT AND GLORIOUS. 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER,
WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY, 
RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THAT'S HAPPENING. 
>>  
>> FROM PHOENIX TO FLAGSTAFF, 
FROM MESA TO YUMA, TO THE RED 
ROCKS OF SEDONA, THIS GREAT 
STATE WAS SETTLED BY SOME OF 
THE TOUGHEST MEN AND TOUGHEST 
AND MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN EVER 
TO WALK THE FACE OF THE EARTH. 
THEY ARE GOING TO SAY TOMORROW 
HE CALLED WOMEN BEAUTIFUL. 
ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE?  
IT WILL BE TRUMP CALLS WOMEN 
BEAUTIFUL. 
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. 
YOU ALWAYS WERE AND YOU ALWAYS 
WILL BE. 
IT'S FUNNY. 
I AM THINKING, I'M JUST 
WATCHING THIS, I THINK WE'VE 
GOT HIM. 
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. 
ARIZONA IS WHERE WYATT EARP 
BECAME A LEGEND, WHERE THE 
AMERICAN WEST BECAME THE 
AMERICAN DREAM, AND WHERE 
GENERATIONS OF FARMERS, 
RANCHERS, PIONEERS AND SOLDIERS 
USED DOWN TWO HANDS TO BUILD A 
LIFE AND A HOME. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY. 
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON. 
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES. 
THEY LOVED THEIR COUNTRY AND 
THEY LOVED THEIR GOD. 
>>  
>> THESE COURAGEOUS ARIZONA 
PATRIOTS DID NOT SHED THEIR 
BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS SO THAT 
WE COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE 
OTHERS TRIED TO ERASE THEIR 
LEGACY AND DESTROY OUR PROUD 
AMERICAN HERITAGE. 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM AND 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN, 
WE ARE GOING TO WORK. 
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT. 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN WIN WIN. 
>>  
>> WE WILL NOT BEND. 
WE WILL NOT BREAK. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER EVER BACK DOWN. 
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER AND WE 
WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO 
VICTORY. 
ALWAYS. 
>>  
>> BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICAN AND 
OUR HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE, 
AND BLUE. 
>>  
>> WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE 
FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION 
UNDER GOD. 
AND TOGETHER WITH THE PROUD 
PEOPLE OF ARIZONA, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU, ARIZONA. 
THANK YOU. 
♪
>> WE HAVE JUST LISTENED TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HOLDING A 
CAMPAIGN RALLY. 
ONE OF HIS MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN RALLIES. 
THEY ARE IN MESA, ARIZONA. 
HE WAS STUMPING FOR MARTHA 
McSALLY AND OTHER REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATES. 
NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT CHIP 
REID -- CHIP REID HAS BEEN 
TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND JOINS ME NOW. 
WHAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE ON 
THE GROUND THERE? 
GIVE US SOME COLOR IF YOU WILL. 
>> Reporter: IT WAS LIKE IT 
ALWAYS IS. 
THESE PEOPLE JUST LOVE HIM. 
THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN RALLIES 
ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM. 
I WILL SAY THEY DO START TO 
FILTER OUT ABOUT HALF WAY 
THROUGH AS HE GETS REDUNDANT 
AND FENDT BUT THE ONES WHO 
STAY, AND I WOULD SAY THE VAST 
MAJORITY DO STAY, REALLY ENJOY 
IT AND THEY JUST LOVE IT. 
IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO 
SEE HOW HE STARTED THIS. 
THE HELICOPTER HE CAME IN ON IS 
OVER THERE AND FIRST THEY HAD 
THE OSPREY AIRCRAFT THAT 
CARRIED THE PRESS AND THE STAFF 
COME IN AND THEN ANOTHER 
HELICOPTER CAME IN AND THEN 
FINALLY MARINE 1 CAME IN AND HE 
REALLY KNOWS HOW TO PUT ON A 
SHOW. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
PRESIDENT OBAMA OR GEORGE W. 
BUSH WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE. 
BUT HE REALLY TAKES ADVANTAGE 
OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THEM 
THE BEST SHOW HE POSSIBLY CAN 
GIVE THEM. 
>> AND I THINK HE LOVES IT. 
IT'S CLEAR THIS IS HALF THE FUN 
IF NOT MORE OF BEING PRESIDENT 
FOR DONALD TRUMP. 
CHIP, REMIND US, WHY IS THE 
PRESIDENT IN ARIZONA EXACTLY?  
WE KNOW HE IS STUMPING FOR 
MARTHA McSALLY. 
HOW CLOSE IS THIS RACE?  
>> Reporter: IT'S A VERY CLOSE 
RACE AND IT'S THE SAME REASON 
HE IS GOING TO BE IN NEVADA 
TOMORROW AND THE SAME REASON HE 
WAS IN MONTANA THE DAY BEFORE 
YESTERDAY. 
AND IT'S THE SAME REASON HE IS 
GOING TO TEXAS EARLY NEXT WEEK, 
PROBABLY TENNESSEE, AND ALL THE 
RACES, ALL THE CLOSE SENATE 
RACES ARE WHAT HE REALLY CARES 
ABOUT. 
THERE IS NO WAY HE CAN COVER 
THE COUNTRY FOR ALL THE CLOSE 
HOUSE RACES ARE THE ONES THAT 
ARE UP IN THE AIR BUT IN THE 
SENATE IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL 
NUMBER OF RACES AND HE CAN HIT 
EACH STATE WHERE THERE IS A 
REALLY CLOSE RACE AND IF HE 
LOSES THE SENATE, THAT'S BIG 
TROUBLE. 
IF HE LOSES THE HOUSE THAT'S 
TROUBLE, IF HE LOSES BOTH 
THAT'S BIG TROUBLE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT, SO HE IS DOING 
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO HOLD ONTO 
THE SENATE AND THE RACE HERE IN 
ARIZONA IS VERY CLOSE AND IT'S 
GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT TURNOUT, 
WHO CAN GET THEIR BASE OUT TO 
THE POLLS. 
IF ANYONE CAN GET THE 
REPUBLICAN FACE OUT THERE, IT'S 
DONALD TRUMP. 
>> I NOTICED HE DID SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT IN THIS RALLY. 
HE SORT OF DANCED AROUND THE 
HISPANIC VOTE A BIT. 
ARIZONA IS A STATE WITH A SOLID 
HISPANIC BLOCK. 
SO AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS 
RALLYING AGAINST ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION AND CATCH AND 
RELEASE, HE STILL WANTED TO SEE 
A SHOW OF HANDS OF PEOPLE IN 
THE CROWD WHO ARE HISPANIC. 
BY HIS ESTIMATE ABOUT 10%. 
THAT'S NOT BAD. 
IT WAS A DELICATE BALANCING 
ACT. 
DO WE KNOW HOW POPULAR THE 
PRESIDENT IS AMONG HISPANIC -- 
HISPANICS IN ARIZONA?  
>> Reporter: IT'S HARD TO TELL 
BECAUSE THE VOTE IN 2016 OF 
HISPANICS HERE AND OTHER PLACES 
WAS DIFFERENT THAN PEOPLE 
EXPECTED. 
IT'S HARD TO TELL BUT YOU 
TOUCHED ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN 
THIS RALLY AND THE BIG 
DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER RALLIES 
THAT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HE 
HAS REALLY LATCHED ONTO THE 
IMMIGRATION ISSUE AND IN 
PARTICULAR THE CARAVAN ISSUE. 
HE IS TRYING TO TURN THE 
CARAVAN INTO SOMETHING TO BE 
FEARED BY AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY 
REPUBLICANS WHO HE WANTS TO 
TURN OUT AND VOTE. 
HE IS JUST HAMMERING AWAY ON 
THAT THEME AND COUNTING THE 
DEMOCRATS POSITION ON 
IMMIGRATION IN AN EVEN MORE 
EXAGGERATING THEY EXAGGERATED 
WAY THAN HE HAS IN THE PAST 
SAYING DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY WANT 
CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS TO 
COME HERE BECAUSE THEY WILL 
VOTE DEMOCRATIC. 
ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME HERE 
ILLEGALLY WILL VOTE DEMOCRATIC 
SO HE IS GOING OVERBOARD TO 
CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THE 
SITUATION ON THE BORDER IS JUST 
HORRENDOUSLY THE ENTRANCE RIGHT 
NOW. 
DON'T FORGET, THE CARAVAN IS 
STILL A -- STILL DOWN AT THE 
MEXICO-GUATEMALA BORDER. 
IF YOU WERE TO WALK THAT AND 
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE, IF 
YOU WALKED THERE -- FROM THE TO 
TEXAS THAT WOULD BE LIKE 
WALKING WASHINGTON, D.C. TO 
FLORIDA. 
IF YOU WALK FROM THERE TO HERE 
IN ARIZONA THAT WOULD BE LIKE 
WALKING FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. 
TO TEXAS. 
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE ARRIVING ANY DAY 
AND MEXICO IS DOING A MUCH MORE 
SERIOUS JOB THAN THEY HAVE IN 
THE PAST TO TRY TO KEEP THEM 
FROM COMING HERE. 
THEY HAVE SAID THEY ARE GOING 
TO ALLOW PEOPLE IN IF THEY HAVE 
PAPERS. 
THEY ARE GOING TO CONSIDER 
ASYLUM CASES BUT PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T HAVE PAPERS AND DON'T 
QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM ARE GOING TO 
BE SENT BACK MOSTLY TO HONDURAS 
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME PEOPLE 
FROM GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR. 
MEXICO IS TAKING A MUCH HARDER 
LINE THAN THEY HAVE IN THE 
PAST. 
IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE MUCH 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THESE PEOPLE 
TO MAKE THAT INCREDIBLY LONG 
AND ARDUOUS JOURNEY FROM THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER OF MEXICO TO 
THE U.S. BORDER WITH MEXICO. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
CHIP REID, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
TRY AND GET SOME REST. 
WE KNOW IT HAS BEEN A LONG DAY 
FOR YOU. 
>>> WE GO NOW TO LAS VEGAS FOR 
EARLIER TONIGHT, THE NEVADA 
CANDIDATES FOR U.S. SENATE HAD 
THEIR FIRST DEBATE. 
REPUBLICAN DEAN HELLER IS 
DEFENDING HIS SEAT FROM HIS 
DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER JACKIE 
ROSEN. 
IT WAS HOSTED BY OUR LAS VEGAS 
AFFILIATE. 
>> TONIGHT, TWO CANDIDATES FOR 
U.S. SENATE FACE OFF IN THE LAS 
VEGAS STUDIOS OF 8 NEWS NOW.
