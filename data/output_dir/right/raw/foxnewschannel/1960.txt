31
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:58,777
WHEN EVERYTHING IS A PROBLEM,

32
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:00,012
NOTHING IS A PROBLEM.

36
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:07,886
ELECTED, BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED.

37
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:09,421
IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO TUNE OUT.

38
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:10,956
THERE IS NO DISTINGUISHING

39
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:12,691
BETWEEN THINGS THAT MIGHT BE A

40
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,526
PROBLEM AND THINGS EVERY ONE CAN

41
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:15,394

42
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:16,962
IT IS ALSO TRUE WHAT THE MEDIA

AS THINK OF NEGATIVE CAN COME

44
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:19,931

00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:44,523
PETE: DON'T YOU THINK THEY CAN

57
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:45,824
SEE THROUGH IT.

58
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:48,226
40% OF THE NEGATIVE COVERAGE IS

59
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:50,362

69
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:07,512
SCANDALS.

70
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:09,247

REALLY HAPPENING WITH A LOT OF

72
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:13,852
MEDIA COVERAGE IS AN TREATMENT

73
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,987
TO RELITIGATE THE 2016 ELECTION.

74
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:18,824
THEY HOP FROM SCANDAL TO

75
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:19,224
SCANDAL.

76
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,525
THEY BREAK NEWS THAT

00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:21,793
DONALD TRUMP HAS MORAL FAILINGS,

78
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,362
MOST PEOPLE WITH A PULSE HAVE

79
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:25,230
KNOWN SINCE THE 80'S.

80
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,631
THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER TO

81
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,166
PEOPLE, LIKE IMPROVEMENT IN THE

82
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,868
ECONOMY ARE NOT COVERED AS MUCH

83
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:31,036
AS THEY SHOULD BE.

84
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,304
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN COVERED AS

85
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:33,772

86
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:34,072
YEARS.

87
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,408
THE STRUGGLE OF THE ECONOMY THAT

88
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,743
WASN'T WELL-TOLD DURING THE

89
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:38,276
OBAMA YEARS.

90
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,178
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DEEPLY-FELT

91
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:40,679
BY PEOPLE.

92
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,280
THERE IS DIFFERENCE WHAT PEOPLE

93
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,949
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT, WHAT THEY

94
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,551
GET 24/7 ON MANY NETWORKS AND

95
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:47,052
NEWSPAPERS.

JIMMY KIMMEL MAKING FUN OF HER.

100
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:56,328
SHE SPEAKS FIVE LANGUAGES.

101
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:59,064
SHE HANDLES HERSELF BEAUTIFULLY.

102
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,665
SHE IS CLASSY, ABOVEBOARD.

103
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,167
DO YOU THINK ALL THE NEGATIVE

104
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,335

WHETHER MELANIA OR ANYBODY ELSE,

111
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:16,948
THAT TENDS TO PROVOKE SYMPATHY.

112
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,551
IT IS FASCINATING HOW LITTLE

113
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,920
COVERAGE WE GET OF MELANIA,

114
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,655
COMPARED TO PREVIOUS FIRST LADY,

00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:26,525
EVERY TIME THEY WORE A GOOD

116
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,226
DRESS IT WAS MAJOR NEWS, MELANIA

117
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:30,495
IS PUSHED TO THE SIDE BY A LOT

118
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,897
OF MEDIA COVERAGE.

119
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:32,864
PETE: PRESIDENT TWEETING ABOUT

120
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,166

123
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:39,271
THINK ABOUT THAT?

124
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:41,706
>> OH, THE THING DONALD TRUMP OF

125
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:42,874
ALL PEOPLE SHOULD NOT WANT

126
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,109
ANYTHING TO CHANGE WITH THE

127
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:44,976

THE NEGATIVE MEDIA COVERAGE.

130
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:50,248
IT IS BAD FOR THE MEDIA

131
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:51,817
THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE SO

132
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,218
OPPOSITIONAL, IT MAKES PEOPLE

133
00:03:53,218 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUST THEM LESS.
