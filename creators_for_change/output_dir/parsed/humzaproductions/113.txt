when it comes to emotional blackmail
Asian parents are the best like you're
eating dinner and then your mom would
hit that and I'm never up get that foot
out of my face and then they would turn

in our time but the one thing that I
hate more than anything is when parents
forget your name but they will remember
all your brothers and sisters names haha
