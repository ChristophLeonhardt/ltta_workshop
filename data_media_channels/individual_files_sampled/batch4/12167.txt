well the left is out to kill Captain America first it was the internet campaign we talked about earlier this week to make Captain America gay a ridiculous stupid moronic hijacking of a popular American icon who was originally designed for children and teens in order to serve the left's pathetic agenda now the editors at Marvel themselves have announced that they're going to make clear that Captain America is a bad guy and he always was according to Time magazine Captain America Steve Rogers number one will make clear that Captain America supports the Nazi founded organization Hydra and that he was always a double agent Marvel executive editor Tom Brevoort explained quote it means on the most fundamental level that the most trusted hero in the Marvel Universe is now secretly a deep-cover Hydra operative a fact that's really only known to the readers and to him that makes every interaction he has with anyone take on a second layer a second meaning so what drove all of this according to time having cap talked openly about the threat of Muslim immigration to Europe and illegal immigration to America's borders that makes him ripe for Hydra here's Brevard again he says quote we try to write comics in 2016 that are about the world and the zeitgeist of 2016 particularly in Captain America any parallels you've seen to situations real or imagined living or dead is probably intentional but metaphorically not literally Brevard goes on to say the Captain America the face of patriotism is turning evil because what we want to push that button he says there should be a feeling of horror or unsettledness at the idea that somebody like this can secretly be part of this organization there are perfectly normal people in the world you would interact with on a professional level or a personal level and they seem like the salt of the earth but then it turns out they have some horrible secret whether it's that they don't like a certain group of people or have bodies buried in the basement so folks this is what happens when the original values for which Captain America stood American pride and patriotism defense of constitutional Liberty become unpopular with the left they have to do one of two things either they have to make Captain America a leftist or gay or make clear that he was a villain all along because America must either be converted to leftism or we were the villain all along as Brevard says quote Captain America because he's draped head-to-toe in the flag has more of a larger symbolic meaning than many other characters in an allegorical fashion you want to make his adventures about where America is and or the world is so here's the problem the left can't play this game indefinitely turns out most Americans don't like the idea of a patriotic Captain America as a hyper villain they don't think America is historically evil they don't think patriotism is evil or that pointing out threats of B'nai 'td Islamic cultures make you a Nazi and they're not going to keep patronizing movies or comics where the bad guy is America or where traditional good guys become bad guys just because they stayed the same so watch for Marvel to twist this storyline back into place it'll make cap the hero again but not before he learns of course that he should be more of a leftist than the traditional right winger he always was that's how they play the game and ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the obelisk intends to demonize people don't care about your feelings alrighty so here we are Donald Trump is doing his campaign charm offensive and it's working Donald Trump is really good at a bet several things that have to do with campaigning campaigning since it basically is one year and a half two year long reality show benefits people who know how to work the camera Trump clearly knows how to do that so he's on Jimmy Kimmel last night and he's very good at this he's very good at this so here's Donald Trump with Jimmy Kimmel on ABC and and Jimmy Kimmel asked him about debating Bernie Sanders here's the question from Bernie he asked Hillary Clinton backed out of an Akutan booked out of an agreement to debate me in California before the June 7th primary right are you prepared to debate the major issues facing our largest state and the country before the California primary yes or no he wants to know if you will debate yes I am how much is he going to pay me you would you would do it for a price what we have because if I debated him we would have such high ratings and I think I should give take that money and give it to some worthy charity oh so if it was done for okay if you paid a nice sum what a charity I would love to do that Oh interesting what if the network put up the money and then you guys can't even happen also I've been saying that should happen anyway you know when we did the Republican debates the Fox had 24 million people the largest in the history of cable television CNN three weeks later had twenty three million people the largest in the history of CNN think of it CNN with all the wars and all the things they cover for it's the largest audience they've ever had the largest audience everyone capable was Fox a couple of weeks before and I must say you know I think I had a lot to do with that okay but but I said why are we getting paid for this and give the money to charity and I actually as you know I've been saying this for a long time get paid give the money to charity pick good charities and give the money to chair okay so there he is it's just ridiculous and and he's you know what he's saying here that he'd debate Bernie Sanders if they give the money to charity first of all Donald Trump just had to be shamed into giving money to charity from the event where he skipped the the Fox News debate but but this is good TV it's good TV and he's very good at this now what's funny is that he says he'll debate Sanders Sanders immediately comes back and says yes I will for sure to bait Donald Trump it's a win-win for both of them is the truth it's a win for Donald Trump to debate Bernie Sanders if he can even mildly hold his own because Bernie Sanders isn't going to be the nominee so what exactly is the cost right he elevates Bernie Sanders at Hillary's expense he makes Hillary look like a coward and then he goes out there and he invades against the 73 year old socialist it's wildly entertaining big ratings he doesn't look Terra terrible his own side Bernie Sanders looks good to his own side Trump maybe even wins over some Sanders voters like it's a good move for Donald Trump to do this naturally within 24 hours he's walking this back and now his campaign says oh it was all a joke from the beginning and so now we're hearing kind of conflicting rumors at this hour was it a joke was it not a joke I mean it's pretty clear from that tape it's not a joke but doesn't matter this is Trump's charm offensive and it's working so for example here's and the charm offensive means that he's now pandering to all the people who watch ABC which means he's pandering to the left so Donald Trump is good at this when it comes to TV he's also somebody who conservatives should should know is not going to stand up for their values so here's Donald Trump asked by Jimmy Kimmel about the transgender bathroom it's true a very easy moral issue you men should not be using women's restrooms women should not be using men's restrooms and here's Donald Trump shying away from the controversy altogether we just say though if you were voting personally remember in New York State that you would vote for the that right well the party generally believes that whatever you're born that's the bathroom you use well what about you and what me I say let the state's decide after say lettuce you personally support it I think what I support know what I support is let the state's decide and I think the states will do hopefully the right thing and what's the right thing I don't know yet I mean I don't honestly that's it it's a very it's a very it's the stupidest thing to be focused on don't we have like after all those blowing apart and yes you know lots of bad things are happening and with a lot of but you know what it's something has to be discussed but I say let the state's decide okay all right all right I'll take you no I'll give you an na and then he gets big applause for that right he's very good at this but notice there's a very clear answer here he won't give it because he knows the kimmel won't like it and kimmel there knows how Trump feels about this which is that he doesn't care if men are using ladies bathrooms or vice versa he thinks that that's a he I mean Kim lets him off the hook right there in a way he never would with Ted Cruz or Carly Fiorina or any of the other Republican politicians this is the draw of Trump Trump has this magnetic appeal he's terrific on television it's also true the media are treating him with kid gloves and you can see that from Kimmel there see I think you do beret I mean he's actually feeding him the lines Kimmel's feeding him the lines so Kimmel's feeding him the lines from left sean hannity's feeding Trump the lines from the right makes Trump a very powerful personality here and Trump is really good at this again here's Donald Trump talking about Hillary Clinton in 2008 I want to get this right you said you thought Hillary would make an excellent president and as recently as 2012 you said you thought she was terrific what did she do well I'm happy just explained to you yeah I will I will tell you what I'm a businessman I had a beautiful story recently where they said Trump is a world-class businessman all over the world we're doing jobs I speak well of everybody if people ask me about politicians I speak well so when they ask me about Hillary she's wonderful the house everybody is wonderful and that's how it is and including contributions they ask me for contributions I give country you were full and Trump goes right along with it because he's good at this right and kimmo hits him but it's but it's a soft hit so you're full of this when you said it in troubles yeah basically yeah basically this is the beauty of playing a role like Donald Trump does there's this beautiful symmetry to playing Donald Trump's role Donald Trump does the clown nose on clown nose off routine that Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart did when they were on Comedy Central when they say something that's a lie or something that's untrue or something that's vicious it's because they were joking or they just weren't being serious and when they say something that's serious then you have to take it seriously because the clown nose is off so but they get to decide post facto whether they were being a clown or whether they weren't being a clown here's Donald Trump says now I'm not being a clown this moment I'm being serious but four years ago when I said all this about Hillary then I was being a clown right then I was just then I was just fibbing because that's what you have to do as a businessperson he does it some more right here again all of this is really good TV Trump is great at this he's great at this so when it comes down to is do you trust Trump really because in the end if he's elected on the basis of this of this sort of campaigning you have to trust that deep in his heart he's a guy who's gonna do stuff for you as opposed to being he's always been a guy who does stuff for Donald Trump here is Trump talking about how he uses aliases and again notice how he's able to get away with all of this easily right any other canted it gets smacked over this Trump is able to get away with it but to me it sounded just like you realize yeah there's any if it was you I think it was a very funny thing to do to call a guy and take him through the ringer but over the years I've used alias and when I'm in real estate and especially when I was out in Brooklyn with my father and I'd want to buy something and honestly nobody knew who Trump was at that time nobody knew me so it wasn't so much so important but I would never want to use my name because you had to pay more money for the land if you're trying to buy land you use different names what may have been aliens I would use I actually used a name Baron and I in turn I'm using myself because I made a very good deal using that name I used an alias in terms of setting up a meeting with mr. Donald Trump and it was and many people in the real estate business do that you use alias and and you have to for honey otherwise they find out at you and they charge you more money and nobody wants to pay more money okay this is the Trump charm offensive now notice he basically used to admit it again that he lied when he used the fake voice before right he says it was I didn't use the fake voice he in Kimball goes I think it was you and I think is really funny when you did it and Trump ASA closet yeah I guy do the kind of stuff a lot he just decided because Kimmel likes him but he's able to get away with it and all of this is good for any Republican candidate I mean if Mitt Romney had been able to get away with this he might be president now Trump is quality at this there's just no doubt about it he's really really good at this in a way so many other people aren't he's funny he's amusing he's entertaining all of this is true all of this is true and it's you know all of that said all of that said you know you you really have to trust that he's going to be the guy who he pretends to be during this campaign now what's interesting is that Trump is Trump's benefiting from two things one he's charming and he's funny on TV and he gets away with all of that and on the other hand he's running against the left so out of their minds that everything that he does is basically him just pushing buttons he's pushing buttons on the left by being funny and entertaining and he's pushing buttons on the right just by pushing button so he's doing it on the basis of contrast President Obama is abroad right now he's over in Japan when President Obama started took the time to rip Donald Trump say the Donald Trump was not interested in keeping America safe here is President Obama they are paying very close attention to this election I think it's fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee they are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements but they're rattled mine and for good reason because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorant of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous and what's required to keep the world on even keel ok so what's interesting about what Trent what Obama says a couple things one he's ripping Oh Trump for being a reality star Obama is a reality star right he's a guy who does interviews with people in bathtubs full of Froot Loops like he actually did that he's with the with delayed the glozell lady who bathed in Froot Loops he didn't interview with her he does this kind of stuff all the time he was just in Vietnam where he did an episode of Anthony Bourdain eating $6 noodles with Anthony Bourdain he is a reality TV star so it just doesn't wash but the second thing that's interesting there is the way that Obama talks about foreign affairs he sounds like he's putting the rest of the world before America he talks about everybody else's reaction to the United States and then he says Trump doesn't do what's necessary to keep America safe by the time he gets to that as an afterthought right by the time he arrives yet Trump is gonna keep America safe it's an afterthought he starts with all these other people around the world don't like Trump and they're rattled by Trump and Trump came out today and he says well maybe it's good that they're rattled by me maybe it's good so you have on the one hand President Obama and then on the other hand you have Trump who's trying to create a sense of loyalty and trust in him and Obama and his and his ilk make it easier because Obama is out there saying that all these other countries don't like don't like Donald Trump and Donald Trump is out there saying well I'm the ultimate patriot and that's really why they don't like me so watch how clever this is Donald Trump with his rally last night and at this rally last night he's told that there was no time for the national anthem watch how he responds this is so clever I got here and they all said we have a great crowd we don't have time for the national anthem I said yes we do we have time for the national and we have a young lady that is going to sing and I said what do you do she said well I was supposed to sing but they had time because of the television cameras they couldn't do it I said guess what we're going to do the national anthem okay so Cheri Wilkins come up Jerry come on okay and then they sing the national anthem right this is this great campaigning it's smart campaigning and it's again drawing this natural distinction between people who believe America comes first and the people like Obama who don't believe America comes first now the problem is that the Donald Trump's brand of nationalism is utterly unmoored from the Constitution of the United States and we'll get to that in a second but when he's running against the left that clearly doesn't care about America's future and he poses himself as the America first guy it's very very smart this is all very smart campaigning by Donald Trump and meanwhile Hillary Clinton continues to prove over and over again that she has no capacity to put America first she puts herself first and she does it very clearly I think Trump by the way puts himself first too but he wraps himself in the flag while he does it so Donald Trump at his rally last night he says crazy bernie is right Hillary Clinton is in trouble because of this new Inspector General report which I'll go over in just a second and we have a person running for office who is not equipped to be President she doesn't have the temperament to be President she's got bad judgment she's got horribly bad judgment and that was stated by none other than crazy Bernie I mean Bernie Bernie said Bernie said that Hillary Clinton has bad judgment now if you look at the world of Iraq if you look at what she did with Libya which is a total catastrophe and by the way and by the way with Benghazi and with our ambassador remember that's all Hillary Clinton folks let me tell you something if she wins and I hope she doesn't but if she wins you better get used to it because you'll have nothing but turmoil and you'll have nothing but four more years of Obama and you can't take them our system and our country can't great our system in our country can't take it America first these people are not Pro America now it's true Hillary isn't right Hillary is about Hillary first and foremost so there's this new Inspector General report that's out from the State Department and I went through it yesterday is about 83 pages long and I went through it and basically this report says that Hillary is a giant liar that she created her private email server for her own personal protection not for any other reason so for example the report says in November 2010 Secretary Clinton and her deputy chief of staff for operations discussed the fact that secretary Clinton's emails to Department employees were not being received the deputy chief of staff emailed the secretary quote we should talk about putting you on state email or releasing your email address to the department in response hillary wrote quote let's get separate address or device but I don't want NT any risk of the personal being accessible meaning she doesn't want anybody at the State Department to have access to emails that she doesn't want them to have email access to the two so she wants to control her entire email output by the way the IG also reports that all emails from Hillary Clinton all emails from Hillary Clinton between January 21st 2009 when she became Secretary of State in April 12 2009 have disappeared all of the ones that she sent in that initial three month period they're gone right they're just gone and she also claimed by the way that she's the blackberry for convenience she was told that she couldn't she continued to do it anyway she said she was cleared by the State Department to use this personal email server she was not the the Office of Inspector General says openly the secretary never requested or obtained guidance or approval to do any of this there are legal penalties to all of this so so this is all hurting Hillary Clinton even among people on the left so Wolf Blitzer has on one of Hillary's spokespeople about her emails and here is Hillary's spokesperson who is trying to explain it away it looks as if she's got something to hide when she doesn't even want to answer questions from the Inspector General of the State Department no look wolf if she had anything to hide she wouldn't be volunteering since last August to go face questions from the Justice Department where the stakes will be much higher than this State Department IG investigation and as I said the appropriateness of the State Department IGS Office conducting this review at the same time when the Justice Department was already looking to the same issue is an open question there were questions raised about this office during the course of its investigation there were reports about individuals in this office coming forward and suggesting that there were hints of an anti Clinton bias and that's inside that office all of that adds interesting are you accusing the Inspector General of the State Department of having an anti Clinton bias and once again this Inspector General was named by President Obama actually Wolfe I think the report today backs up much of what we were saying includes an appropriate amount of context about how widespread the use of personal email was this is nonsense the report really really hurts her and it's clear that even her allies are beginning to look at her and realize that she's corrupt charlatans here's the thing about people like me who are not Trump fans at least we can say were principal folks on the left to back Hillary they're not principal and they're not principled at all but when they look at people like me and they say well you know your party selected Trump yeah but I didn't and you people are gonna get behind Hillary even Hillary's allies are beginning to look at Hillary scans now Andrea Mitchell over on MSNBC is a huge Hillary fan she says that this report is devastating it was not allowed to not return those records before she left the State Department she violated the official records act according to her own State Department IG appointed by President Obama the what you have shown just now mica is completely undercuts the argument she's been making for more than a year it's just as she is trying to persuade voters that she's not untrustworthy I think that the most surprising and in some ways shocking thing is their reaction claiming that this is the same as what former secretaries did the comparison they're making to : Powell the facts are that Colin Powell was the first Secretary of State to ever use email he used it specifically to try to launch this the State Department into the new century and try to get people to communicate by email he was using it as an oh he did use some personal emails he didn't always separate them but it was a completely aboveboard everybody in the State Department knew what he was doing it was not in fact violating a rule that was put in place under Clinton not not after she left I mean this was to Andrea Mitchell and Andrea Mitchell is ripping Hillary up and down this is a sight you never thought you would see right Hillary is so corrupt that even Andrea Mitchell is ripping her up announce CNN's Dana Bash doing the exact same thing saying the scandal really really hurts Hillary Clinton this feeds directly into the narrative that her opponents Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side and ultimately Republicans led by Donald Trump in a general election will be hammering her on and in politics it is the existing narrative and the ability by opponents to feed into that that is the most damaging okay and this is totally correct this is totally correct so juxtapose these two things Hillary Clinton bad on TV not personable not interesting not funny and totally self-absorbed with Donald Trump who's going out there at the beginning of his giant rallies and saying that he wants to sing the national anthem even if there's no time and he's going out on national TV and he's saying that we should give money to charity if you wanted to bait me let's give money to the poor people it's it's a bad juxtaposition for Hillary Clinton and the bad juxtaposition keeps getting worse because the protesters in favor of Hillary and Bernie Sanders keep doing things that make Trump look good so in for example here's a piece of tape you're about to see a an anti-trump protesters dump water on a Trump fan only one one well the two issues one dumping water us at number two the this Trump fan happens to be in a wheelchair our cameras caught someone throwing water at a trump supporter passing by in a wheelchair a man shouted back asking officers to help him out no did I these people have no clue what really goes on I guess they're even going to lie to themselves about what they just did to a handicapped person who has a right to rally for the other side and this is totally right this is totally right so this is why Trump is doing well now all of that said it's important to recognize that Trump's brand of nationalism his brand of patriotism is an empty vessel it's an empty vessel into which he can pour any policy he wants so long as he wraps himself in the flag everybody says well at least he's wrapping himself in the flag at least he likes the flag as opposed to Hillary and her elk we've now got politics for third-graders right it's it's two opposites two opposing parties and you have to buy into one of them otherwise you're a traitor to the cause there's only one problem okay Donald Trump is is again he's still unpalatable and I don't listen I don't want to hammer this home but but every day I'm gonna call it like I see it guess we're gonna get here I'm gonna call it like I see it I was asked yesterday by somebody why don't you just tone down the criticism of Trump now that it's a general election don't you want Hillary to lose you hate Hillary I hate Hillary I also think that Trump is a bad guy and I'm gonna call it like I see it that's my obligation here you I actually will give you both sides you get to decide if you think that that Trump is too bad to vote for that's your decision that's been my decision is that I don't want him becoming the leader of my ideological movement which is his goal as we'll talk about right now Donald Trump says by the way that he wants the GOP to look different now so what does he want the GOP to look like he says quote five ten years from now different party you're going to you're going to have a Workers Party a party of people that haven't had a real wage increase in 18 years that are angry okay a workers party I mean not to not to put too fine a point on it but perhaps the workers of the world should I don't know like unite and all they have to lose is their chains right and this is what I've heard whenever people talk about a Workers Party typically what they mean is the government coming in and taking money away from some people and giving it to the workers right the workers the idea being that if you're a speculator on Wall Street if you're a hedge fund manager if you're a businessperson if you're somebody who makes money in finance if you're a lawyer if you're a doctor if you're not a worker right then then you have to be punished because you're not the guy in the Rust Belt that's what Donald Trump wants to build and this is what Donald Trump is going to fill this sort of empty patriotism he's got wet and it's empty because Dom because my patriotism is based on the idea of American exceptionalism and America is not exceptional because we have different borders or because the land is so great America is exceptional because of the ideals upon which it was founded these basic conservative ideas about the nature of man and the nature of government that's why I'm patriotic I'm patriotic because I believe that America's founding ideals are the greatest founding ideals ever created for any country in the history of mankind and that's why I'm an American patriot Trump doesn't understand those ideals Trump is just for America because America is where he is what's funny is that Barack Obama once said that he believed in American patriotism in the same way that a Greek person probably believes in Greek patriotism or a British person believes in British patriotism Trump actually believes the same thing he just actually believes that right Trump actually believes in the flag and motherhood and apple pie but he doesn't understand why he doesn't understand why and so what that means that he's taking the content out of conservatism and replacing it with just the the image of the conservative he's the face of conservatism buddies a facade so here's just some examples of that yesterday's rally he's speaking in Anaheim and after he does the national anthem routine which is fine again I like it I think it's a I think it's a great piece of theater I think it's also a good thing to do you should start your if we should start big rallies with the national anthem that's wonderful and of course draws the natural juxtaposition to that famous picture of President Obama supposedly not putting his hand to his heart during the national anthem in the 2008 race and President Obama's statement he doesn't want to wear a flag pin because he thinks that that's devaluing right he draws that contrast but here's the real Trump the real Trump is the guy who says the Republican Party must be transformed into a Workers Party not that we're going to use our ideas and appeal to working men and women who need jobs and can only be guaranteed those jobs by a free economy no he's gonna be the man who stands up for the working class he's gonna make them promises that make your head swim so first more more audio of Donald Trump we've done this before but Donald Trump is the kind of guy who threatens protesters so he does that yesterday but he does it in the way that he always does the half-joking Donald Trump way a hundred percent I get him out of here get him out get him out get them out out out out out don't hurt him see what I say don't hurt him I say that for the television cameras do not hurt him even though he's a bad person folks bad person okay that's your Donald Trump that's the guy that does that sound like basic founding principles of free speech to you I mean the implication there's pretty clear isn't it he's a bad person if the cameras weren't there I might be saying something different but since the cameras are there I'll sort of say okay well you know you know don't hurt him I'm saying that just cuz you guys are watching but he's a bad person okay the idea don't hurt him even though he's a bad person like once you drop the even though the rest of it doesn't really matter very much that sound old Trump same rally here's Donald Trump making promises that would make you remember what the Obama phone lady remember the Obama phone lady from 2008 right he's gonna give me a car he's gonna give me a house he's gonna give me a microwave he's gonna give me all sorts of he's getting me a phone he's gonna give me everything I'm not gonna have to work again everything's gonna be free Donald Trump is about to make those exact same promises to the people at his Anaheim rally yesterday here we go you're all here legally you have houses you have homes we're gonna keep your houses in your homes you're gonna have them forever and your jobs aren't gonna be taken away that by people that are just coming across the border you don't know where they're coming from and you don't know where okay and then he continues by saying he says they're your homes aren't gonna be taken away your everything is gonna stay the same your job isn't gonna be taken away how can he guarantee that the fact is that these jobs are not being lost to illegal immigrants okay there's not an IT guy who's losing his job to an illegal immigrant these manufacturers in Ohio aren't losing their jobs to illegal immigrants they're losing their jobs to global competition they're losing their jobs to the fact that you can buy the labor cheaper elsewhere and half the time that labor is cheaper in America down south right not in Ohio a lot of the car manufacturing jobs aren't in Detroit anymore they're now in Mississippi and Alabama that's where these factories are now being built but there he is making promises you can't possibly keep you're going to keep your house when was the last time an illegal alien went to somebody's house threw them out of their own house and then just sat there that's not the way that the economy what that's not the way anything works but he's making promises he can't possibly keep because he's founding the new Trump Workers Party and then there's Donald trum ocking Bill Kristol so Bill Kristol is the editor of The Weekly Standard Bill Kristol was famously a proponent of the Iraq war by the way Donald Trump originally backed the Iraq war bill kristol has also said we need to take a harder line with Iran Donald Trump here is saying that anybody who is hawkish on foreign policy all they really want to do is just kill people and the reason the bill kristol doesn't like him is because Donald Trump doesn't want to kill people so here's isolationist Donald Trump he's a real lightweight his name is Bill Kristol from day one this poor guy this poor guy i watch him but here's what I don't understand why do you keep putting a guy on television that's been proven to be wrong for so many years first of all he wants the war in Iraq he wants Iraq all the guy wants to do is kill people and go to war and kill people even though he knows it's not working although he doesn't know because he's not smart enough but it started and I was against the war in Iraq let me tell you and I am a tough cookie and we're going to have the biggest strongest most powerful military and nobody's going to mess with us nobody nobody is going to mess with us but I just happened to see this guy and one of the shows the other day Bill Kristol he's got some magazine I don't even know what that Litton and he's saying huh we're looking for another candidate we're looking we're looking he's sweating he's sweating and he's we're looking for another candidate here's a guy that said Trump is he gonna run if he runs he's not going to do well he's going to be out by September uh you know he forgot one thing he forgot to ask my friends and he forgot to ask the people that know me because those are the people that said we're going all the way okay okay so that it's just this is from an eidetic it is lies on top of lies here in terms of in terms of the Iraq war he didn't oppose the Iraq war certainly not in any loud fashion before the Iraq war the idea that everybody who was in favor of the Iraq war just wants to see people killed which is what he says about Krystle max he says Krystle just wants to see people die that's really all he wants this is what you're signing up for you're signing up for this wrapped in the flag so I guess it's the idea is that wrapping yourself in the flag is a good thing and that the flag is a good thing I agree the flag is a good thing what isn't a good thing as bad ideas wrapping themselves in the flag and Donald Trump is a guy who is a bundle of bad ideas he's a bundle of bad ideas wrapped up in a veneer of patriotism and that to me is actually more troubling than then even the the anti flag nonsense of Obama and Hillary Obama and Hillary don't like any of the any of this stuff right they're not America first people I don't think Trump is an America first person in any real sense either I think that he's an America first person in the sense that he thinks that what happens in the country matters more than what happens abroad but I don't think that he's an American first person in that he believes in American principles I really don't think that that's true so you know that that's that's the choice that's on people's hands and I understand as I've said before I understand I get it if you say every day I say this is now the official mention Piro show disclaimer if you say that you're voting for Donald Trump because he's not Hillary Clinton but you see what a bad guy he is I'm okay with that I can deal with that you and I can be friends we can we can agree to disagree if you start talking about Trump as though he's somebody who's praiseworthy or trustworthy or Donald Trump is going to be the savior of the country or Donald Trump is going to come into office and he's not going to pervert conservatism in any way and thousands of people who show up to his rallies buying into this mumbo-jumbo that those people are not going to see conservatism is something that it's not at least acknowledge the risks at least acknowledge the risks of what is happening here but all of that said Trump is very good at this and if you have to handicap this race right now you have to assume that if the race continues to go like this then Hillary has a lot of problems one of those problems by the way is Hillary herself there was this meme this web ad that was going around that nobody seems to be able to identify the source of this web ad but it's really it it's it's this ad and if you can't see this folks this is why you need to subscribe to daily wires this is actually two separate ads okay the ad on the left is a stock photo of a guy who I'd like to describe as beardy mchip stir and beardy mchip stir over here he's kind of smoldering into the camera he's got a big beard and he looks like a lumbersexual and he's got the sleeve tattoo and it says I'm with her I am man enough to vote for a woman hache are you hashtag man enough for Hillary right this is what Hillary's campaign and some people in Hillary's campaign apparently we're tweeting this out we're still trying to verify where this originally came from right and and a couple of problems with it number one this guy's a stock photo and because he's a stock photo that means he's also appeared on a syphilis ad in Portland which is real awkward so Hillary and syphilis the gift that keeps on giving but second of all Hillary's so bad at this she's alienating the very people that she's attempting to draw right if you really want to draw men the last thing you want to do is get them the last thing you want to do is make them feel emasculated there's not a man alive not a man alive who goes around saying you know what I really want I want a woman to call me not enough of a man if I don't do what she says right now that really makes me feel like a real man down deep is when a woman orders me around and then if I refuse to obey she says well that's probably because you're a big pansy yeah that doesn't work so Hillary's really bad at this Trump could very easily win this race just because Hillary is so bad at this now that said the polls in the swing states don't particularly show this they don't show Trump making inroads in Ohio they don't show Trump making inroads in for example Wisconsin or Michigan or Pennsylvania all areas where he's supposed to be doing well but he's running a much better campaign than she has just done any objective level at this point even if I think that his fundamental principles are deeply flawed okay time for some things I like well one thing I like one thing I hate and then the mailbag so you've been doing children's movies that I like and this one we go all the way back to 1947 is Pinocchio which is probably the greatest animated film ever made and the opening scene alone the animation the opening scene because this is frame by frame animation this is when they were doing it frame by frame it's it's a beautifully animated film obviously it is an intense film I mean this is not for really little kids there's there's a lot there that's scary lamp-wick turning into a donkey's kind of scary the Stromboli is scary the whale is scary that is it's not for kids who are who are younger than 7 but for kids who are older than 7 it's great and it shows you that back in the day this was considered you know good children's entertainment it's a lot scarier than a lot of the stuff that kids would watch today it also has principles and morals so there is a song I've mentioned this people in the office of the Lindsay's already nodding because she knows where I'm going with this there's a song in in Pinocchio or Jiminy Cricket is singing - Pinocchio about you become her the way you become a real boy the whole the whole movie is about how you become a moral human being right you want to be a real boy you have to be responsible for yourself and you have to make moral decisions moral decisions and so Jiminy Cricket comes along and the Blue Fairy says he's going to be Pinocchio's conscience and so here's the song he sings about what you have to do if you want to if you want to become a real boy basically now you see the world is full of temptations temptations yep temptations there are the wrong things that seem right at the time but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes sometimes the the wrong things may be right at the wrong time or vice versa hmm understand ah but I'm gonna do right attaboy pinoke and I'm gonna help you and anytime you need me you know just whistle like this no no try to get the dope like this no son now listen that's it come on now let's see and you get in trouble and don't know right from wrong give a little whistle when you meet temptation and the urge is very strong given the wisdom given in the vessel not just a little squeeze pucker up and blow and if your whistles we take the straight and narrow path and if you started to slide a little muscle give a little pisser and always let your conscience be your guide okay so that's the morality of the United States when this movie comes out right when this movie comes out the morality of the United States is keep on the straight and narrow path avoid temptation if temptation should strike then always let your conscience be your guide don't do what's always feeling good right that's the morality that they're teaching the kids now now here's the most popular kids movie from today the most popular kids movie from today is frozen and I hate frozen I think frozen is a bad first well I think it's just a bad movie I mean the animation is beautiful but that's a given and the technology is good now I think it's a bad movie I think the plot is bad I think it doesn't make any sense but beyond that the morality that is promulgated in frozen the most popular song from this from this movie is let it go right this is the one everybody sings idina menzel is singing this or as john travolta calls her automatically faculty glue and and she she sings the part of Ilsa now of course the the gay left wants to make Ilsa a lesbian because it was funny when this movie came out there are few commentators who said that this whole movie was basically supposed to be a gay metaphor it was supposed to be and and there's I don't think it's totally out of the realm of possibility given the fact that the movie opens basically with this girl having issues right that are affecting her sister and the parents literally lock her in a closet for sixteen years right literally and she stays in the closet for sixteen years and then she comes out and she lets it go right so here is it but here's the morality forget about whether it's that so now the left is said it's always funny the left always says no it's not about that how what are you thinking you people are crazy now they're saying they want to make her a lesbian of course so in any case but this song in particular drives me up a wall and the reason it drives me up a wall is because of this particular lyric and we'll play the lyric and you'll see the differ between Pinocchio and maybe autumn in 1941 Pinocchio between Pinocchio and and frozen you see what I can do to test the limits no rope no rules for me Oh hye-won let's a job okay so the animation is beautiful and all that okay so that there's that one line okay there's a line did you hear it because everybody skips right over it because it's just a lyric in a song right no right no wrong no rules I'm free right now contrast that Pinocchio's nineteen forty contrast that with Pinocchio which is now seventy-six years ago in nineteen forty kids in America were being taught temptation is not what you should be going for you should be thinking about what's right you should be thinking about what your conscience would say now it's I'm free I'm a better person I'm strong if I pay no attention to the rules no right no wrong there's no such thing as right there's no such thing as wrong it's basic moral relativism right then back in nineteen forty make sure that you do what's right right Pinocchio says I want to do what's right and Jiminy Cricket says that's the way pinoke now it's there's no such thing as right right doesn't exist wrong doesn't exist although there's no rules it's just whatever makes me feel good about me this is why America's dying this right here is why America is dying because these are both taught to kids they're both taught to kids but if you taught the messages of Pinocchio to kids today that would be consent a considered intolerant and nasty and closed-minded because who knows maybe Pinocchio's idea of what's right is not your idea of what's right instead we should all just follow our instinct which I'll just follow temptation wherever it leads men will all be happier we should never contain ourselves now there are people who would say about frozen okay Ilse ends up being basically wrong and chested she has to learn to control her powers okay but that's not the point none of these kids are gonna be singing those songs the only song the kids saying is this one let it go is the most popular song for kids in America and it has one of them it has the Lady Gaga message right I was born this way I'm on the right track because I was born this way this is the new morality the new morality is my biology says do it temptation says do it there's no such thing as right or wrong I feel free because I don't have to pay attention to those stodgy old rules then make sure that we can all operate with each other in a decent society though stodgy old rules that make sure that we don't hurt each other or mistreat each other so that's the thing I hate the thing I like Pinocchio the thing I hate frozen okay time for some entries from the mailbag and we do have a chock-full mailbag reminder if you subscribe through daily wire.com to this podcast aside from seeing this beautiful face you also get to email me and you get first priority in the mailbag so Austin writes hey Ben I was reading your article it's textbook discrimination to force employers to violate their religious principles hire the mentally ill I got to the part where you state it's downright fascistic I use the Mac OS X's dictionary to define fascistic it states having or relation to extreme right-wing authoritarian or intolerant views or practices what do companies like Apple have to gain from playing a word game being the most valuable brand in the world well I mean it's not they have anything to gain it's that Apple is staffed entirely by leftists and the way that they input the dictionary definition is a left way right the typical leftist thought has been fascism is of the left Jonah Goldberg has a fabulous book called liberal fascism specifically about this fascism is is not a is not a it's not an element that is restricted to the right a hitler was as it was a socialist who's closer to Bernie Sanders than he was to the knees to Donald Trump Trump is closer to Bernie Sanders by the way the knees to Ted Cruz so the fascism tends to be an element of the left specifically because the right is defined at least conservatives normal concern not reactionary right I mean there are a bunch of different variables here but when I say right what I mean is traditional conservatism traditional conservatism is defined by a small state it's defined by the idea that states should not intervene in things unless there are externalities unless some third party is being impacted the state should basically stay out of it and social institutions should ensure that the social fabric that remains rich and that we're tied together Ben writes I was wondering two things first you do the show in one take and do you do it extemporaneously or do you write some of it out first okay Ben so here's the deal yes it's all one take and I do do it extemporaneous Lee the only stuff that I ever write is the monologue at the very beginning so that's that's written out usually but most of the rest of the show is is totally extemporaneous Luke writes hey Ben what's your stance on minimum wage is a minimum wage even necessary I've watched a majority of your speeches and TV appearances on YouTube I have yet to read any of your books which one would you recommend first well the first book I'd recommend you read of mine is bullies that's the one that that is the most popular anyway and it sort of states my fundamental philosophy of politics which is bullies need to be fought and bullies are the people who call the guns when they don't get their political way those are those are the bullies as far as my stance on minimum wage no you don't need a minimum wage all minimum wage is its way for the government to prevent two consenting people from entering into a contract understand every job is me entering into a con tract with somebody else and that person has to agree to enter into the contract with me I don't think any third party has the moral right to intervene in that deal any more than I think that a third party has a moral right to establish a maximum wage I don't think the government should make a minimum wage or a maximum wage I think the government should stay out of it I get to sign a deal because I'm a free person you're a free person we get to do that together and right I feel a little clueless Ben can you explain what you mean specifically when you use the verb trolling I'm a new subscriber love the podcast with a view okay and when I use the word trolling and I used it a couple of days ago trolling is the is this phenomenon where you say something deliberately provocative just to elicit a response from the other side now you do something a little bit crazy a little bit out there just to drive the other side nuts that's trolling so if you're a real troll then you spend all your time kind of insulting people on Twitter because you're hoping that are going to respond and this makes you feel good about yourself the entire alt-right is a bunch of trolls so these are people who just throw out anti-semitic racist stupidity and then they and then when you say god that's pretty terrible what you're saying oh ha ha ha I've got you now this just proves that you think everybody's a racist or an anti-semite it just proves that you care about these things and the answer is yes and you're an a-hole right so yeah all trolls are that's what bloody troll it ok Eric writes hey Ben I'm also 32 I agree with most everything you say it's nice to see someone our age standing up for conservative principles it doesn't happen much especially up here in Seattle I read your article on why you wouldn't support a conservative third party run but I'm a huge fan of Romney not only would he pull support from Hillary and Trump he could win states like Utah Idaho and maybe a few others do you see any scenario where conservatism is better off coalescing around Romney than waiting for years okay Eric so I wrote a column and I talked about on the show all the various reasons why I don't think a third party run would be useful most of those reasons are tied to the fact that wouldn't be successful so if Romney were to vote would run third party I would vote for him vote for him over both Hillary and over Trump it would be an easy call I would lose no sleep whatsoever over voting for for Mitt Romney if Mitt Romney is the margin of loss for Donald Trump however you can guarantee that all of the people in the Republican Party are going to blame the Conservatives for having thrown the election from Donald Trump to Mitt Romney and therefore you know they're going to insist that they come back around the next time around and I'll beat everybody so again if Romney were to decide to jump in I wouldn't oppose it for sure do I think from scratch it's a great idea to run a third-party candidate I don't because I think the opposition to Trump is is and the opposition to Hillary is stronger than any one candidate and I think it's kind of difficult to coalesce around any one guy and and this is certainly true of Romney I mean I listened I didn't support Romney in the primaries in 2012 right so I would back him against these other two but as I've said before in a different context I'd blame me I would back a flaming bag of dog feces against either one of these two options Nicole writes my sister is facing overwhelming pressure to be liberal since she's a physics professor which is it by the way that's that in and of itself is hilarious why physics professors should be facing pressure to be lefty is beyond me I don't understand why the speed of objects falling and rising you know why friction I don't understand why any of that has to do with politics but the left basically what you really mean is your sister is a professor so she's getting pressure so she is so so despite being a moderate conservative she's now voting for Bernie woo as much as I desperately want her to see reason I'm worried I will beat her over the head with logic and facts instead of gently persuading her is there a nice way to undo liberal brainwashing also it's nice to have your show to remind me I'm not crazy it's everyone else that lost their mind okay so thank you I appreciated that the the way to talk to family members you have to talk to them on their own level some people are open to talk some people aren't if it's a waste of time to talk don't bother you know browbeating people doesn't help on one-to-one level when it comes to talking with her if you can't use backs and reason then there's not really much to talk about this person is so emotionally tied into the system that you're going to have a rough time of it you know the real way to argue with the Bernie Sanders crowd is to say what you are saying is fundamentally immoral you don't get to steal money from other people just because they have more of it than you do it's fundamentally immoral Bernie Sanders's view of life is immoral it's cruel it's evil and it requires vast government centralization and the use of the government gun in order to take things that aren't yours that's what Bernie Sanders is about I mean that's the moral case but that said it's very difficult to talk with family members there you sort of have to determine whether they're open reason or whether they're not if they're not open to reason don't waste your time just go see a movie instead men rights do you watch Game of Thrones no I started watching Game of Thrones and then it turns out that the that the pornography of it sort of alienated me I've read all the books um it's the books are the first three well let's say this one is good one is very good two is week three is is good again and then the rest of the series is just awful awful so I I do follow the recaps of the shows online mainly because I don't feel like waiting for the next 87 years for george RR martin to bring out his next 800 page monstrosity so I read the recaps of the show because it's ahead of the books now but you know I find George RR Martin's universe really nihilistic and I understand people die I understand good people get killed I understand I I totally get all of this I don't need it to the point of fiction is that I trust the creator of the fiction to bring me to a place I want to go right this is the same reason that that religious people are religious we trust a God eventually is going to bring us where we want to go even if we can't see it right now if you're just going to tell me the life is empty and horrible and all the people that I like die yeah I know that already I don't need to I don't need to spend time with the people just so that you can kill them off all the time like I'm fine with you wanna kill like when they killed off and in the first book when they kill off Ned Stark say okay that's that's creative and interesting because you never see a main character just get killed off like that when they killed Rob I was out I was like okay I mean I read it but come on and then they killed Rob and then they and then they killed Jon Snow but they brought Jon Snow back and mmm did whatever whatever I think that it started off with a great premise and then and I understand the premise is anyone can die at any time that's all fun and games unless you kill everyone worth rooting for and I end up rooting for Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton in Game of Thrones it turns out the Lannisters against the against the the sands sisters is not a whole lot a lot of fun I'm not that interested in that particular battle so I'd much rather have a hero at some point in the story Tyler writes at what point of if at all should the right embrace protectionist foreign policy with entities like China aren't trade deficits a bad thing how can the free market remedy this ok trade deficits are not a bad thing I have a trade deficit with my grocery store that doesn't mean it's bad all the trade deficit means when you're talking about private parties trade deficit all that means I'm buying stuff from people and they're selling me stuff that's what a trade deficit is it doesn't mean I'm poor it doesn't mean they're rich right the fact is that you can have a trade surplus and be wildly poor this happens all the time most of Latin America had a trade surplus but as Venezuela has a trade surplus last I checked because they don't produce and because they because they don't have the ability to buy anything some of the richest times in American history we've had a trade deficit some of our poorest times we've had a trade surplus as far as using protectionism his foreign policy this is an actual argument like should we have tried to collapse the Chinese state back in the 1970s by jacking up the tariffs and crippling their economy there's a case to be made on a moral level for that but certainly not on an economic level ok finally leon writes hi Ben what do you think are potential solutions for the housing crisis in LA many of my leftist friends are advocating for removal of the Ellis Act to solve it I think that's an absurd idea but what are your thoughts ok so I will admit I don't know much about the Ellis acts I'll just answer the general question which is potential solutions for the housing crisis number one there's no housing crisis in LA all that's happening is there's a shortage of supply and there's too much demand and there aren't enough jobs that's all that's happening right now the answer is that if you want housing pricing you're saying you want housing prices to go down if you want housing prices to go down you have to get rid of what rid of whatever rent control restrictions there are in the city of Los Angeles you have to loosen some of the zoning restrictions you have to allow people to rent out their garages for example so they can use that as a guesthouse and you also have to just get rid of building restrictions as a general matter you increase supply in other words make it easier for people to to supply housing and the prices will fall Texas is not having a problem with massive real estate bubbles because everybody can just move to the middle of nowhere and build stuff so New York has a problem LA has a problem Chicago has a problem get rid of the restrictions and you'll get rid of the housing crisis you also have to get rid of some of the business regulations so that people can actually work and be hired and make money so all right we've reached the end of another week hope you have a wonderful weekend and we will be back here on Monday for more celebration of the well actually sorry no no no Monday's a holiday run days we'll be back here on Tuesday it's a long weekend I know don't worry we'll be back here on Tuesday to make it up to you because we love you and
