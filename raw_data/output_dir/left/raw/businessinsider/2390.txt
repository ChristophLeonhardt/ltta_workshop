1
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,210
the old model of venture investing is

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,340
produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> some horrible returns over the</font>

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,869
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years which has led a lot of</font>

4
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to say what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it is in venture</font>

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,769
investing over is it done in some

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,359
quarters<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably seems to be but</font>

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,460
some firms such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York's union</font>

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,470
square ventures of doing extremely well

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,260
and Roger you say that in part this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,668
because they really have a new approach

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,829
to investing in venture capital no

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,079
that's right Henry kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I coin</font>

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,550
it is kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecosystem approach to</font>

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,200
investing where you know historically

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,910
venture firms have kind of wanted to own

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,590
a deal and keep all the capacity for

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,180
themselves and say they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to own</font>

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,219
twenty-five percent of a company in

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,690
order for the deal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense for</font>

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,600
them and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really old school what</font>

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,430
firms like Union scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> Square has done</font>

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,930
what I've done as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> angel and what a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">number of smaller firms in the New York</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">area have done is really take this</font>

25
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,680
approach of we want to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,989
syndicate that can really help d risk

27
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,270
the early-stage nature of these

28
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,979
companies syndicate of investors coming

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,900
in exactly so instead of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,030
focused on I own twenty-five percent of

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,080
the company or<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty percent of the</font>

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,240
company it's better if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> own fifteen</font>

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,860
percent of the company but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I surround</font>

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,950
myself with strategic value added

35
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,540
investors who can really help<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentor</font>

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,860
with a company make<font color="#E5E5E5"> key business</font>

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,630
development relationships and help

38
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,610
nurture its growth and if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

39
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,170
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great right you've got</font>

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">all sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different expertise you're</font>

41
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,110
not just relying on a particular

42
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,360
partners brilliance or the founders

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,400
brilliance and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> but don't you</font>

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too many cooks in the kitchen sort</font>

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,329
of thing or you spread out

46
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:40,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility so much that nobody cares</font>

47
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,150
it's just chump change investments for

48
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,740
each person<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that's a great question</font>

49
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,360
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that that's been</font>

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
mitigated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to date is where there is a</font>

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,380
distinct lead they're the ones that have

52
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,850
the board representation and they're the

53
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,920
ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are kind of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the linchpin</font>

54
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,960
if you will they're the the face to the

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,590
board but company CEO wants to reach out

56
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,240
to somebody in a given sector and one of

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,590
their investors has that relationship

58
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,469
not necessarily the VC then they go

59
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,420
straight to them and the investor's

60
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,610
perspective isn't I want control it's

61
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply I want to help and I want to</font>

62
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">maximize the value my investment</font>

63
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,400
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that model does it change the</font>

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,319
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies you invest in and what</font>

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,120
makes them successful or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

66
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,760
need a good idea and a great team at the

67
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,940
company to execute sure done a very good

68
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">question i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it really subjects</font>

69
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,930
itself well in things like digital media

70
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,610
social media advertising technology

71
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,340
where you're selling into specific

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,720
customer bases where legacy

73
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,549
relationships are incredibly valuable if

74
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,500
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing pure science you know if</font>

75
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,629
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean tech or biotechnology</font>

76
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,909
then clearly i would say that approach

77
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,400
is less important now a broader question

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,230
about venture capital which is that part

79
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what happened in the 1990s in the</font>

80
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,220
last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of leading up to now as</font>

81
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,430
you the reason funds got so huge because

82
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,720
the partners can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much more</font>

83
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fees under management and so forth</font>

84
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,620
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that creates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the need to put these</font>

85
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,230
gobs of money to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every deal and</font>

86
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,670
so forth so it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what you're</font>

87
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,650
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much smaller scale it is</font>

88
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,629
smaller companies they need less capital

89
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:08,129
is this going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drive a lot of</font>

90
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,299
traditional venture firms out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

91
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,069
business I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

92
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,260
that the combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of enabling</font>

93
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,430
technology is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> much much cheaper</font>

94
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,980
and the fact that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these these</font>

95
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,720
business models require<font color="#E5E5E5"> just less</font>

96
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,910
capital over their life that yes a lot

97
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those firms that have kind of morphed</font>

98
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,849
into asset managers as opposed to being

99
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,680
true venture investors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to go</font>

100
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
by the wayside the rel peas are going to

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,609
say we're done but then those firms that

102
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,019
still can deploy significant amounts of

103
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">capital but it's going to be</font>

104
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,440
longitudinally it's going to be over the

105
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,209
life of an investment it's not going to

106
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:37,680
be stuffing them with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollars</font>

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,139
day one it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be playing in the</font>

angel round<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing in the early stage</font>

and then leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> their a and building a</font>

110
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,720
bigger syndicate in there be and you

111
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,919
know some of those businesses I mean

113

has required a lot of capital but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

kleiner and Sequoia are they adapting to

117
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,209
this model or do they have the prestige

118
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,650
where they can say no sorry we are
