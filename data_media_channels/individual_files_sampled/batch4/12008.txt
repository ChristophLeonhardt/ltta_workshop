so I'd like to talk about an issue that isn't discussed enough there have been recently a number of stories of false rape accusations and the terrible consequences that accompany them and before we get into the examples I think the first question of course anyone asks is is well how common it is this problem I mean how often does it happen that somebody is falsely accused of rape feminists and other liberals well if you've heard them talk about this you've probably heard the figure 2% and here's the thing about feminists feminists love to make up statistics I think it's their favorite thing to do in the world they enjoy that even more than yelling and screaming at men they they they just love making up statistics it is it's really that's their favorite pastime so they have this 2% figure that they will often cite they'll say well 2 percent of all rape accusations are false now I want to give you an example of how that that that argument is framed and you know I was just looking this up online to try to get to the bottom of it and I found just for instance an article on the website quartz calm which was published in 2017 and it says this it says let's start with the idea that false rape accusations ruin lives and are therefore a universal risk to men generally feminists dismissed this idea by arguing that false accusations are rare only between 2% and 10% of all reports are estimated to be false what's equally important to know however is that false rape accusations almost never have serious consequences now we'll get to that almost never have serious consequences thing in a second but let's look at two percent to ten percent okay so um that's the range that we've been given here and so 2% is you know like I said that's that's what you'll most offered here let's look at that the problem with 2% is that as I said it's a made-up figure okay it's not it's tit is not it's just it's not based in reality a report by a man named Edward Greer which was published in the Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review and I think 2000 or 2001 tried to get to the bottom of this figure to find out where it originates that's why it's a lengthy report where he goes into detail about this idea that only 2% of all fall of all rape accusations are false and Greer discovered that it originates from a book written in 1975 and the book gives this figure and cites as its source a speech which was given by a judge the year before so Greer contacted the judges law clerk and found out that nobody really knows or remembers where that figure came from it's just it's just something that the guy said in speech in other words it's a false statistic from 40 years ago
