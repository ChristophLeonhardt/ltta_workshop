no father should have to visit the site of their son's murder but this is Michael's fate he doesn't know who stabbed to death his boy Michael jr. in a South London Park the attack seems to have been random for months on the police appeal for information people is being tight-lipped we're facing a barrier which is people thinking to herself that if they open their mouth and say something they're going to be labelled has been an informer or a snitch just another London knife crime this robbery earlier this month on camera but no one will tell the police who this is the epidemic hundreds of knife crimes every week these some of the weapons used driven say the police by territorial gangs drugs and in London there's an ethnic dynamic I recognized that there's a disproportionate number of young black males that are getting stabbed and unfortunately being killed the gangs don't necessarily follow racial groups in fact some of them can be very multicultural but as a rule at the moment we're finding the biggest threat to a young black male is indeed a young black male this club tries to give children focus yes children this young are at risk from gangs the man who founded this club was killed aged 20 in a knife crime his mother tries to explain what's gone wrong community centres being closed down no emotional support for our young people it affects their mental health depression anxiety this project helps fill the void left by cuts in social spending by the government the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is not responsible for those cuts but as a high-profile politician in the capital he's feeling the political heat of the knife crime crisis at a time when that demand and policing is going up the supply of police and because of government cuts is going down his opponents say his policies are incoherent he's too slow to spend the money he does have this week he sent a message to young Londoners London needs me alive so I don't carry a knife it's too late for Mahad stabbed to death at a North London party attended by hundreds last summer the police who have very few ethnic Somali officers are again struggling for information this community is disproportionately affected but a mother's despair well that's universal I love my son he is love from each other his mommy boy his good boy I'm never for good Barnaby Phillips al-jazeera London
