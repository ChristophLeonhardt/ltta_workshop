136
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:03,098
YEAH, RIGHT.

137
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,567

COMMITTEE.

163
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:00,355
THIS IS THE KIND OF CORRUPTION

164
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:01,757
THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED TO

165
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,659

166
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:04,826

DOWN ON THE RESOLVING DOOR

170
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,302
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND LOBBYING.

171
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,337
AND MICHAEL COHEN'S PEDDLING

172
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:16,805
DIDN'T WORK.

173
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,407
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TOOK

MERGER.

176
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:25,047
BUT THE SIGHT OF A TRUMP INSIDER

177
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,848
RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO HELP

178
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:29,985
BIG CORPORATIONS IS AN INSULT TO

179
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:30,953
EVERY TRUMP VOTER.

180
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:32,321
