“These cyber actors are
using social media platforms
to spread disinformation —”
“and set Americans
against each other —”
“targeting both sides of a
country’s most divisive issues.”
You’re watching
a recent
Senate Intelligence
Committee hearing
about how
foreign internet trolls
are using social media
to influence American politics.
In the lead-up to the
2016 presidential election,
Russian trolls used
disinformation campaigns
to sow discord.
Experts are now seeing
similar activity heading
into the 2018 midterms.
“The trolls are trying
to improve their tactics.
They’re trying to get better
at hiding their traces.
So it’s going to be a
game of cat and mouse.”
Ben Nimmo is a senior fellow
at the Atlantic Council’s
Digital Forensic Research Lab.
He works to
identify and analyze
online disinformation.
“The way these accounts work
has always been a
combination of infiltration
and radicalization.”
He walked us through
some of the imagery
and strategies used by
notorious online trolls
from Russia and,
perhaps, elsewhere.
First, they pick a
hot-button issue.
“There are certain very
high-profile problems
that American society has,
which are well-known abroad.
And it tended to be those
ones which are targeted.
So the original
troll factory accounts
were very heavily
engaged in the debate
on gun control and
the Second Amendment,
on women’s rights
and abortion rights.
They were heavily engaged
on Black Lives Matter.”
A slew of inauthentic accounts
that Facebook recently deleted
took the same approach,
updated to fit
the latest top news.
They use identity politics
and emotion
to appeal to followers.
Next step, tap
into a community.
“So you start off by
making positive comments
about the target group.
Let’s say you
want to masquerade
as a Black Lives Matter supporter.
You start by making lots
of positive comments
about the
African-American community.
You talk about how
beautiful the girls are.
You talk about their
glorious cultural history
and you try and engage
with real activists
who are busy on this subject.”
Now it’s time to ramp it up.
“Once you’ve established
your credentials,
you start slipping
more and more toxic content
into the mix.
So, rather than
saying positive things
about your community,
you start saying negative things
about other communities.
The war against
colonialism is a theme
that comes up on this page
time and again.
It’s a hint at violence.
And last,
they try to move from the
online world into real life.
“And then maybe you
slip into the mix a suggestion:
‘Let’s have a protest.
Let’s get real people out
on the streets.’
And then,
because you’re operating
probably from
some time zones away,
you need to think, ‘Well, how
do we get this to happen?’
And you start
trying to reach out
to genuine local
organizations.
Maybe you say, ’Well, we can’t
turn up on that day
because we’ve got
something else going on.
Why don’t you
organize this for us?’”
In 2016, Russian trolls
organized political events
for and against both
presidential candidates.
At an Islamic center
in Houston, they organized
a protest and the
corresponding counterprotest.
“Down with the racists!
Down with the Nazis!”
So why go
to such lengths?
These bad actors
are trying to polarize
the American public
by exploiting existing
tensions in our society.
The goal?
Make Americans
see each other as enemies,
especially during high-stakes
events such as elections.
If people feel they can’t
trust their neighbors
or their government,
democracy falters.
“There is a massive,
sophisticated,
persistent campaign
on multiple fronts
to misinform, divide
and ultimately manipulate
the American people.
Is that accurate?”
“Yes.”
