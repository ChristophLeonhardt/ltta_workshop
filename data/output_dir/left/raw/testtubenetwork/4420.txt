00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,670
In recent months, a number of groups have
promoted misconceptions about Muslim beliefs.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,570
In particular, broad generalizations about
the treatment of women in the Muslim world

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,450
have widely been used to paint Islam as brutal
or inhumane.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,470
But for many of the world’s one and a half
billion Muslim men and women, this does not

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,470
ring true.

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,650
So, what does the Western world often get
wrong about women in Islam?

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,009
To start, public debate in the west often
characterizes women in Islam as subordinate

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,780
to men; and in some ways, inferior as a result
of Islamic scripture.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,530
Men having multiple wives, women being forced
to wear facial coverings, and not allowed

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,010
to leave the home are often used as examples
of such oppression.

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,739
Many believe that Islam’s holy book, the
Quran, dictates these rules, and is thus inseparable

12
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,239
from the values of Islam.

13
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,870
But this is not quite true.

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,379
While there are, in fact, Quranic verses which
say that men are “in charge” of women,

15
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:01,280
the Quran also stresses fairness and justice
towards women.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,430
For example, although polygamy is often justified
by a passage in the Quran, that same passage

17
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,880
says, “if you fear that you will not be
able to maintain justice between your wives,

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,050
then marry only one.”

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,660
Values concerning the respect of women in
the Quran are often overlooked in interpretation

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,720
and practice.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,420
Moreover, the overwhelming majority of “rules”
found in Muslim majority countries which are

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,400
oppressive to women do not have a direct basis
in the Quran.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,700
Instead they are the result of rulings by
Muslim jurists since the 10th century - long

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,660
after the death of the prophet Muhammad, and
the writing of the Quran.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,960
A closer look at the inequality women face
in certain countries shows that it is not

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,119
Islam, or Islamic teaching which promote oppression,
but oppressive governments using religion

27
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,720
to maintain control over their people.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,690
One frequent example is Saudi Arabia, where
women suffer from some of the worst inequality

29
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,690
in the world.

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,170
Their prohibition from driving, or leaving
the home without a chaperone, comes up again

31
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,980
and again in the media.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,649
But Saudi Arabian oppression extends to many
other groups, including minorities, and even

33
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,300
other sects of Islam.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,479
And those rules against women driving aren’t
found in any other country.

35
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,900
In other words, oppression in Saudi Arabia
is largely a problem with Saudi Arabia, not

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
with Islam.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,090
Meanwhile, Muslim women in countries like
Indonesia and Malaysia see considerably greater

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,290
freedom, and higher rates of education, while
keeping within Muslim tradition.

39
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,180
In Indonesia, women have a roughly 90% literacy
rate, as compared to Pakistan where the rate

40
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,880
is closer to 40% These more liberal countries
are marked by greater democracy, and a blend

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,330
of cultural influences from other religions.

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,830
For Muslim women living outside of politically
unstable monarchies and theocracies, life

43
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,580
is considerably better.

44
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,920
And while passages within the Quran do place
women in a somewhat deferential role to men,

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,660
that is arguably also the case in all three
Abrahamic religions, including Christianity

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,800
and Judaism.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,050
And in all cases, the real issue is governments
and movements that build control around religion.

48
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,530
It is important to understand that the repression
of women is not simply a factor of extremist

49
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,080
Islam, but of extremism as a whole.

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,670
But women are fighting back, both against
repressive governments and Western misunderstanding.
