1
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,250
Now there’s a familiar
bit of everyday wonder —

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,680
dandelion seeds in flight.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,020
Just blow on a dandelion head
and watch the tufts separate

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,640
and drift off — a block,
a mile, maybe 50 miles.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,670
So how do they do it?

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,680
Scientists knew
that it all depended

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,750
on the intricate structure of
the seed’s fluffy top,

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,390
known as a pappus.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,920
But how did it work?

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,780
Like a balloon, or
a wing

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,460
or something
completely different?

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,070
To find out, researchers
used a small wind tunnel

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,260
to mimic a falling seed.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,390
They recorded in
great detail how

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,300
the air flowed through
and around the pappus.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,520
What they discovered
was a vortex

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,370
never seen before in nature.

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,300
As air moved
around and through

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,450
the parachute-like top
of the dandelion seed,

20
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,820
the complex interaction
of air currents

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,010
eventually formed a vortex.

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,040
And that swirl of air
created a low-pressure area

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,530
that helped hold the seed
up, allowing it to travel

24
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,050
long distances on the wind.

25
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,300
To test the idea
that empty space was

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,370
the key to the
vortex, the scientists

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,940
constructed artificial
dandelion seeds —

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,400
tiny silicon discs with
lots of empty space.

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,180
Sure enough, the exact
same vortex appeared.

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,670
Understanding how the
complexities of air flow

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,100
support the flight
of dandelion seeds

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,190
could offer clues on how to
create minuscule drones —

33
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,500
so-called smart dust.

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,530
But just for now, you can
think of dandelion seeds

35
00:01:29,530 --> 00:00:00,000
as flying at the intersection
of efficiency and beauty.
