MORE NEWS OUT OF NORTH KOREA,
NORTH KOREA FIRED A BALLISTIC
MISSILE TODAY, WEDNESDAY
MORNING, THAT'S WHAT TIME IT IS
THERE -- IT IS ALSO WEDNESDAY OF
NEXT WEEK, THEY DON'T TELL YOU
THAT -- ODDLY ENOUGH THAT DEFIED
DEMANDS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
THAT THEY HOLD THEIR WEAPONS
PROGRAM.
IT RAISES THE STAKES IN
WHAT COULD BECOME A NUCLEAR
FUELED BATTLE ON THE KOREAN
PENINSULA.
THIS IS THE NEWS TODAY, WHICH
MEANS THAT THIS, FROM WHEN
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSED THE
UNITED NATIONS, WAS IT LAST
MONTH?
>>THEY ALL BLUR TOGETHER.
>>EARLIER, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
ADDRESSED THE UNITED NATIONS.
>>ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE
MISSION FOR HIMSELF, AND FOR HIS
REGIME.
THE UNITED STATES IS READY,
WILLING, AND ABLE, BUT
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL NOT BE
NECESSARY.
>>HERE ARE THE DETAILS ON WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY FROM THE NEW YORK
TIMES --
>>AGAIN, INDICATIONS WOULD BE
THAT, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE,
NORTH KOREA PLOWS AHEAD AND DOES
WHAT IT ONCE REGARDLESS OF
WHATEVER ANY U.S. ADMINISTRATION
SAYS.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
WILL TRY TO BLAME THIS ON OBAMA,
THAT THEY LEFT THIS MESS, BUT
THE REALITY IS THAT THINGS HAVE
GONE BEST FOR NORTH KOREA WHEN
WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH THE MOST,
WE ARE ENGAGING NOW WITH THEM
LEAST, BUT THIS PROBLEM HAS
EXISTED FOR AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
SINCE THE END OF THE KOREAN
POLICE ACTION.
>>THE WAY THE TIME WORKS IS IT
WAS 3 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IN
1958 -- EXCEPT THEY HAVE NUKES
NOW.
IT IS WEIRD BECAUSE THEY
TOOK TWO MONTHS OFF BETWEEN WHEN
THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY SHOOTING
OFF A ROCKET EVERY FEW WEEKS, IF
NOT MORE OFTEN, AND FOLKS
ARE WONDERING WHY IS THAT
HAPPENING.
>>LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT GRAPHIC
21 --
>>THIS HAS 
BEEN A PARTICULARLY
BUSY YEAR FOR NORTH KOREA
TESTING WEAPONS.
>>ONE APPROACH COULD SAY THEY
WEREN'T READY WITH THIS MISSILE
YET, IT WAS DELAYED, SO THEY
WANTED -- THEY COULD NOT LAUNCH
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T READY,
MAYBE THEY HAD A TECHNOLOGICAL
PROBLEM OR IN THE MEANTIME
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ARE
PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT TO ASIA TO
TRY TO RALLY SUPPORT, AND ENVOY
WAS SENT TO NORTH KOREA FROM
CHINA, MAYBE THEY WANTED TO SEE
HOW HOT CHINA WANTED TO EXERT
PRESSURE OR NOT, WHAT KINDS OF
THINGS THEY WANT TO SAY IN THEIR
MEETING IN BETWEEN THEM, AND
ALSO THERE WAS THE LEVYING OF
SANCTIONS FROM THE UN SECURITY
COUNCIL AND INCREASE SANCTIONS,
PUTTING NORTH KOREA BACK ON THE
LIST OF STATE SPONSORS OF
TERROR, MAYBE THEY HAD SOME
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES THEY
NEEDED TO HANDLE.
>>
THIS IS BEEN A PARTICULARLY BUSY
YEAR FOR NORTH KOREA TESTING.
>> THEY TOOK SOME TIME OFF.
THEY WEREN'T READY WITH THIS
MISSILE YET, IT WAS DELAYED.
MAYBE THEY HAD A TECHNOLOGICAL
PROBLEM OR IN THE MEANTIME
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OUR
PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT TO
ASIA TO TRY TO RALLY SUPPORT
THERE.
MAYBE THEY WANTED TO SEE JUST
EXACTLY HOW HOT CHINA
WANTED TO EXERT PRESSURE OR NOT
OR KINDS OF THINGS I WANTED
TO SAY IN THEIR MEETING IN
BETWEEN THEN.
THEN ALSO THERE WAS THE LEVYING
OF SANCTIONS IN THE UN SECURITY
COUNCIL AND INCREASED SANCTIONS
AND PUTTING NORTH KOREA BACK ON
THE LIST OF STATE TROOPS AND
MAYBE THEY HAD SOME KIND OF
INITIATIVE ISSUES THEY NEEDED TO
SEE TO KIND OF HANDLE THE
REPERCUSSIONS OF THAT CHANGING
POLICY.
>>ALL THAT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.
SO IS NORTH KOREA WAITING FOR
THE RETURN OF DENNIS RODMAN.
MOST LIKELY IT'S THAT PYONGYANG,
I KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE IT WELL
BECAUSE I WATCH MASH, THEY ARE
OPERATING ON THEIR OWN TIMETABLE
AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS.
IF THERE WAS A COMPELLING REASON
TO SCALE BACK, IF THEY ARE
ENGAGED AND MAYBE THEY WILL.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT A
DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION
WOULD HAVE NORTH KOREA ENGAGED
IN A MORE MEANINGFUL WAY.
BUT THEY ARE HEADING FOR THEIR
70TH ANNIVERSARY AND I
THINK THEY WANT TO SAY OUR
NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS COMPLETE.
AND WE ARE READY TO BOMB.
>>AND THEY WILL DO IN THE KIND
OF COMMERCIAL PROPAGANDA
THAT MIMICS A CIALIS COMMERCIAL.
LIKE YOU'RE GETTING UP THERE IN
AGE, MAKE SURE YOUR HEART
IS HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR NUCLEAR
ACTIVITY.
WE ARE GOING TO SEE A WEIRD
PROPAGANDA VIDEO THAT WILL
KINDLY OFFSET HOW TERRIFYING IT
IS THEY ARE DOING THIS.
>>YOU
THINK KIM JONG UN IS GOING TO
HAVE A WEIRD PROPAGANDA VIDEO?
>> OF COURSE THEY ARE TRYING
TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
THE PERSON THAT
TOOK NORTH KOREA OFF THE LIST OF
STATE SPONSORS OF TERROR WAS
GEORGE W. BUSH.
NO ONE HAS SOLVED IT.
TRUMP HAS UNDERCUT Ã± YOU WANT TO
SEND A MESSAGE THAT IF YOU BACK
OFF YOUR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THINGS
ARE GOING TO GO A LOT BETTER FOR
YOU BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS
HAPPENED ANY RON, IF THEY AGREE
TO A NUCLEAR DEAL AND TRUMP HAS
DONE NOTHING TO TRY TO UNDERCUT
THAT, THAT PROMISE HAS NOT BEEN
DELIVERED ON AND IT IS A LOT OF
PEOPLE'S FAULT, BUT IT SEEMS
LIKE IF YOU ARE NORTH KOREA AND
YOUR PRIORITY IS TO STAY IN
POWER YOU DON'T SEE A CLEAR PATH
TOWARD STAYING IN POWER THAT
INVOLVES GIVING UP YOUR
NUCLEAR ARSENAL.
>> THE COUNTRY HAS MADE STRIDES
IN ITS BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM
SINCE KIM JONG UN TOOK
POWER.
NOW WASHINGTON HAS MAXIMUM
PRESSURE AND SANCTIONS TO
STOP NORTH KOREA FROM REACHING
THE STAGE WHERE THEY WILL
BE ABLE TO DELIVER A NUCLEAR
WARHEAD ON ITS ICBMS.
BUT THEIR LEADER SAYS THIS
COUNTRY WILL CONDUCT MORE
MISSILE TEST TO HONE ITS
CAPABILITIES.
I READ THIS AND IT MAKES SENSE.
THEY WANT TO BE READY BY THE
TIME THEY TURN 70.
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING FOR.
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHICH
ADMINISTRATION YOU GET TO BLAME.
THERE WAS A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY
WHERE THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT
DIVIDE ON BECAUSE THEY WERE AT
THE BARE MINIMUM HUNDREDS
AND THOUSANDS OF CONFIDENT
PROFESSIONALS.
HE IS NOT MIKE FLYNN, DAVID
CLARK, SARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS, OR MIKE HUCKABEE, OR
ANY OF THE TRUMP KIDS.
HE IS NOT STEVE BANNON OR ROGER
STONE.
HE IS NOT A RAVING LUNATIC WHO
SHOULD HAVE NOT HAVE NO
INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER.
HE WILL GO DOWN AS THE WORST
SECRETARY OF STATE IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
HE HAS NO BUSINESS AT THIS JOB.
THE MERE FACT THAT WE WANT TO
LIKE HIM NOW BECAUSE HE HATES
TRUMP AND TRUMP HATES HIM IS A
POINT IN HIS FAVOR, BUT THE
ONLY POINT.
THE NOTION THAT THIS
ADMINISTRATION SELECTED AS THE
GUY TO LEAD THE STATE DEPARTMENT
IN THESE TROUBLING TIMES, THAT
THEY WOULD HIRE AN OIL EXECUTIVE
TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
IS AN OUTRAGE THAT WE HAVE LET
SLIP OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE
WE HAVE HAD 1000 MORE.
BUT HE HAS NO BUSINESS IN THE
JOB.
THE STORY IS THAT HE DOES NOT
WANT THE JOB AND WE ARE
SEEING PROFESSIONALS LEAVE THE
STATE DEPARTMENT IN DROVES.
THERE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPACT
FOR THAT IN THAT EVENTUALLY WE
WILL RUN OUT, OF THE NORTH KOREA
EXPERTS PARTIALLY I DON'T BLAME
THEM FOR LEAVING BECAUSE THEY
ARE LIKE NO ONE IS LISTENING TO
ME.
MY LIFE IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT
NORTH KOREA HAS DONE, WE
KNOW THEY ARE NOT BEING INVITED
TO THE TABLE, AND WE KNOW
THAT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO REX
TILLERSON DEVOTED TONS OF
STATE DEPARTMENT RESOURCES TO
FINDING HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP
TOUTING REX TILLERSON AS AN
ANSWER TO ANYTHING.
HE IS NOT AND IT IS AS BAD A
MOVE AS TRUMP HAS MADE IN THE
FRACTIOUS DANGEROUS WORLD THAT
WE LIVE IN, THAT HE APPOINTED AN
OIL EXECUTIVE FROM EXXON TO RUN
THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
