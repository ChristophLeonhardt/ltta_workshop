well Rudy Guiliani tried his hand at public defender of Michael Cohen when he was trying to defend Michael Cohen's hundred thirty thousand dollar payment to stormy Daniels but Rudy Guiliani is nowhere to be seen or heard trying to defend Michael Cohen's financial arrangements for the money that was paid to Michael Cohen by giant corporate interests trying to buy access to the President of the United States Rudy Giuliani was willing to say anything when it came to defending Michael Cohen for what Michael Cohen said was using his own money to pay off stormy Daniels to buy her silence about her sexual relationship with Donald Trump Rudy Giuliani said it's the kind of thing he did all the time for his clients that was money that was paid by by his lawyer the way I would do out of his law firm funds or whatever funds doesn't matter the president reimbursed that over a period of said Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of things like this for my clients this is the kind of thing that I've settled for celebrities and famous people every lawyer that does that kind of work has that kind of admission to a dis bärbel offense was a little too much to bear for the giant law firm from which Rudy Giuliani took a leave of absence to become Donald Trump's and Michael Cohen's public defender the firm Greenberg Traurig announced today that Rudy Giuliani is no longer on a leave of absence because the firm has completely severed its relationship with Rudy Giuliani and the law firm announced that Rudy Giuliani was not telling the truth about paying off porn stars and other women to buy their silence for celebrity clients with the law firms money Jill Perry the law firms spokesperson told the New York Times we cannot speak for mr. Giuliani with respect to what was intended by his remarks speaking for ourselves we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client Rudy Giuliani issued a written statement about his departure from the firm today I believe it is in everyone's best interest that I make it a permanent resignation a written statement from Rudy Giuliani when did Rudy Giuliani become so careful so reserved issuing a written statement instead of going on Fox News and blabbing about it and while he's at it calling stormy Daniels lawyer Michael avenatti an ambulance chaser his favorite phrase of last week Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump have not dared to say the words Michael avenatti this week after Michael avenatti revealed the millions of dollars in payments that Michael Cohen's LLC has received after he used that LLC to pay stormy Daniels 130,000 dollars including the payment of a five hundred thousand dollar inflow from a company with strong family ties and business ties to the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg that is the payment exposed by Michael avenatti that has finally brought the stormy Daniels story together with the Russian influence in Trump world story it has been Michael a vanadis most important moment so far and most startling revelation about Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani has nothing to say about it not a word this week Rudy Giuliani has been silenced either because the president realizes how much damage Rudy Giuliani Rudy Giuliani does every time he opens his mouth or Rudy Giuliani and the Trump team cannot think of a single thing to say about Michael Cohen pulling in multi-million dollar paychecks by selling access to Donald Trump or both as expected we're learning more about the big payments to Michael Cohen every day but president Trump's audience in Indiana tonight seems to have heard nothing about it and the speech writers for one of the most corrupt if not the most corrupt administration in history actually put these words in the president's teleprompter tonight under my administration we're fighting against the lobbyists the special interests and the corrupt Washington politics one of the special interests that paid over a million dollars to Michael Cohen for the first year of the Trump presidency is now admitting that it was a big mistake the new CEO of the pharmaceutical company Novartis who inherited the Michael Cohen deal from his predecessor sent an email to his employees today saying we made a mistake entering into this engagement and as a consequence are being criticized by a world that expects more from us one senior Novartis employee speaking on the condition of anonymity said that many who work there feel disgusted this person added people are angry and confused because it makes all of us look bad The Daily Beast reports today that the payment to Michael Cohen was by far the largest payment that Novartis made in its lobbying efforts during all of 2017 Novartis formal payments to outside lobbying firms averaged under $12,000 a month less than an eighth of what it paid Cohen for the better part of a year in which the company says he did exactly zero work for that zero work Novartis was paying Michael Cohen 100 thousand dollars a month AT&T was paying Michael Cohen 50 thousand dollars a month and we now know thanks to the Washington Post that AT&T was paying Michael Cohen quote for help on a wide portfolio of issues pending before the federal government including the company's proposed merger with Time Warner according to documents obtained by The Washington Post ATT internal documents show that Michael Cohen was hired to quote focus on specific long-term planning initiatives as well as the immediate issue of corporate tax reform and advised the company on matters before the Federal Communications Commission Michael avenatti was met once again with terrified silence today by Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump when he tweeted a copy of an email that appears to be an email sent by Michael Cohen two days after the FBI raided Michael Cohen's home office in hotel room in his first tweet about this today Michael Evan Adi said on April 9th the FBI raided mr. Collins home office in hotel room within 48 hours mr. Cohen sent the below email to mr. Davidson why they had no ongoing legal matter at the time was it part of an attempt by mr. Cohen to obstruct justice or worse attached to the tweet was an email from Michael Cohen to Keith Davidson who was stormy Daniels lawyer at the time she negotiated the confidentiality agreement with Donald Trump the Cohen email says I lost all my context as I had to get a new phone please send me all your contact info also why did Anthony back out of back out on ABC to do the story let me know how you want to communicate it signed Michael D Cohen Esquire personal attorney to President Donald J Trump Michael avenatti and another tweet pointed out mr. Giuliani claims that mr. Cohen is no longer mr. Trump's lawyer as of when because as of April 11th 2018 this year he was still his lawyer as evidenced by the email I just posted see also mr. Trump's comments on Air Force One that same month Michael havenõt avenatti has not revealed today how he obtained an email from Michael Cohen to attorney Keith Davidson joining our discussion now Harry Lippmann former federal prosecutor and Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Clinton Tim O'Brien executive editor of Bloomberg view author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and an MSNBC contributor and Jennifer Rogers former federal prosecutor she is now executive director of the Center for advancement of public at Columbia Law School and Harry Whitman that that signature block on Michael Cohen's email is fascinating because this is the new phone that he had to get after the FBI seized all of his phones more than a dozen of them apparently and so he had to deliberately type on to there after the FBI raid personal attorney to Donald Trump what's your reading of that well it's also the title that he was very unabashed about using apparently around the world and certainly around the u.s. in order to drum up business everyone's saying you know pay to play in the same old same old but it isn't because one of the things he was doing it's ironic at the same time as he's touting himself he was also selling a certain kind of anonymity that's the reason that he wasn't registered as a lobbyist under the LDA and so the companies were not simply buying access they were buying quiet access and that it seems that that's how a company like Novartis could slip into paying him agreeing to pay him a million dollars before they had even met him there's there was something extra going on besides normal pay to play is there a legal point is there something the Bar Association would be interested in in a lawyer who after the FBI raid in this case Michael Cohen on his new phone types in their a personal attorney to Donald J Trump if that isn't true if that's just something someone's decided to type in there to impress people when it's no longer true are there any legal ethical implications to that well I think the Bar Association will be interested in a lot of what Michael Cohen that's been doing I'm not sure this is at the top of the list I mean yes if Trump had officially ended their relationship then yes you can't represent that you're the lawyer anymore but I mean everything Michael Cohen is doing in this period of time from acting as an unregistered lobbyist to the payments to stormy Daniels without the clients permission or maybe with the clients permission and hiding that I mean there are all sorts of things going on here that the Bar Association I think is going to basically end his legal career over Tim O'Brien you are our our Michael Cohen Donald Trump psychiatrist here in fact I mean you you've dealt with both of them you know them both that you ended up getting sued by them over you over your book about Donald Trump which you won that that case is it is it just as innocent as Michael Cohen has no identity in his of his own without those words personal attorney to Donald Trump well I wouldn't use the word innocent but it could it's way too strong a word but it's an explanation Donald Trump you know during the campaign during the transition and for most of his business career has been higher has been surrounded by people who've tried to hitch their star to his wagon Michael cone is just the latest in a long line of those kind of people the email that he sent to Davidson by the way didn't even have Trump Towers address on it it was his own office at 30 rock I think it was in and right that's also true the address he used was the 30 Rockefeller Plaza address which was the office that was raided and the day it was raided that law firm said he's no longer here right so even the address is false right in the email right and this is somebody who from towards that from after Trump was elected until that point in time when he's sending that email had been shunned by Trump largely he didn't get a job in Washington he was iced out of most of the deliberations during the transition but who would get jobs down there it wound it him Trump actually didn't begin reaching out to Cohn again via Twitter until after he owns office got raided he then he was worried about Cohn flipping on him I think all of this stuff of I'm the personal attorney to Donald Trump is somebody just hanging a shingle out I think to see if they can get money and and those payments that Michael avenatti detailed I think are just the result of a guy lobbying not lobbying approaching big corporations and saying I can get you access but as we know certainly in the case of Novartis they were only a month into the relationship until Novartis realized he couldn't deliver and they ended it but they kept paying him for the rest of the year because they weren't legally allowed to end the contract and paying him but they stopped working with them because he actually I don't think that much access to Trump and that's why I think of all of those payments the more significant one is the one involving Columbus Nova a possibly victor veteran that's the one where there's of the the Russian link lurking right in the background of that one yeah and that goes I think to the heart and soul of part of what Robert Mulder's investigating is whether or not there were quid pro quos around policy to people in the trumpet communicated to people in the Trump administration in exchange for money and whether or not Donald Trump himself knew about that so Harry Lippmann we have learned through Mike 11 a tease revelation of these payments and then a lot of the great reporting done by the Washington Post and others and following up a bunch of information about these payments to Michael Cohen which obviously special prosecutor Robert Mahler has known for quite a while wait this is once again a revelation of how far ahead of us he is what do you see as the special prosecutors main points of interest in what we have publicly learned this week well look when he finds out about this even though there they don't unless there's been some act and quid pro quo by an officeholder the fact that Cohen is going around basically being a grifter doesn't necessarily sound as a federal crime there are things that might have been fraudulent and violation of election law in the stormy Daniels thing and that's what might have been cited his interest but generally if you're a prosecutor and you find out all this mess with essential LLC what the hell is going on that he's doing both the hundred thirty thousand dollar payment but also the repository for the the four million dollars there's some reason to think that based on the contract with stormy Daniels which has some anomalous passages that it was sort of used in other places I think for Muller what he wants to know basically is every dollar that went into essential LLC and every dollar that came out and what what kinds of financial crimes could that could those describe it's a little hard to say as Tim says there's possibly mischief of an international nature but it's certainly enough to get your antenna buzzing as a prosecutor and Jennifer Muller knew all of this and more obviously knows more than we do about all of this including where the money went before he the referral of this information was made to the Southern District of New York before he basically handed over this file and everything he'd found on it and sent it up here to New York that's right now we're hearing that 18 to you Novartis spoke to Muller's team in November and we know it was probably sometime between November and January when the case went to SD NY so they've been on this for a long time they've definitely sorted all of this out you know I'm wondering if one possibility might be actual just flat-out wire fraud here I mean we don't know what representations Michael Cohen made to these companies and I think they'd be reluctant to admit that they were the victims of fraud because it makes them look bad I mean AT&T Novartis or public companies after all but you know this could be just a flat-out fraud case he could have been defrauding them for this month so the elements of fraud could simply be Michael Cohen promises AT&T or or one of these other companies I can do X and it turns out he could not do X that would be it that's right I mean he lies to them it can't just be like puffery it can't just be oh I'm so great and then it turns out he can't deliver like a like a real lobbyist would do but he has to promise them things that are factually untrue and then he doesn't do it and he takes their money and there obviously has to be some jurisdictional elements and so on but that could have been what's going on here now whether that becomes a case or not I don't know that these quote-unquote victims will want to play the victims in this scenario but you know that might be some of what was going on here as he's kind of trying to kind of get this money into his account so Tim for example Michael Cohen to AT&T just as a hypothetical don't worry I can get Trump to go along with the merger I can get your multi billion dollar merger pass and that turns out to be a Justice Department does that sound like something Michael Cohen will Michael or Michael Kohn can help you navigate Obamacare and drug price policy or he can help you get for Korea aerospace Air Force Air Force contracts wheat some reporting tonight that came out in the Washington Post we know in fact that AT&T specifically wanted help with its takeover of Time Warner that that came out and documents that they got and it had to dawn on them pretty quickly that Michael Co knew nothing about telecommunications regulation antitrust policy drug pricing or airforce contracts and the strange thing I think that this sort of event says is that in the moment that Donald Trump got elected K Street erupted because no one had a relationship with him and so all of these firms were scrambling to find someone that they thought did and it sort of boggles the imagination that they thought that Michael cone would be the guy that could deliver on these things to him one could grow up if I could signal artist as Tim is saying there they're saying we couldn't terminate the contract of course they could have him he was really doing nothing that's obviously a cause so he has the perfect victims in a sense because the corporations don't want to have agon their faces they just want to go away well Jennifer what about the legal implications of that because one of the companies is said we were afraid to end the contract because we we were afraid of the president's anger if we ended a contract with his friend right exactly I mean it this is what we're talking about this is where you might look to crimes kind of associated with that they're not what people are thinking of people are thinking of quid pro quo bribery that probably isn't what we have you know we might have this fraud and you could even throw threats in there possibly if that's kind of what they're saying it was based on a specific comment so you know we'll see whenever I hear the word threats Michael Cohen I have his threats memorized that have been revealed publicly in the past Jennifer Rogers Harry Lippmann Tim O'Brien thank you all for joining us in this beginning of our discussion
