1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,282
NOW THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST

2
00:00:01,282 --> 00:00:02,316
AND WE MIGHT HEAR SOMETHING ON

3
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:02,850
FRIDAY.

4
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,250
WE'LL SEE.

5
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,018
BACK TO YOU.

6
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:04,985
>> Dana: WE'LL COME RIGHT

7
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:05,753
BACK TO YOU, GREG.

8
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:06,320
THANK YOU.

9
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,056
TO HELP US BREAK IT DOWN.

10
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:12,259
JAMILE JAFFERS, FORMER ADVISER

11
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,861
TO THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

12
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:14,261
COMMITTEES.

13
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:14,995
GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

14
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:16,931
IT HAS BEEN DISORIENTING TO

15
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:18,532
HAVE KIM JONG UN BE SO

16
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:18,899
CORDIAL.

17
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,635
HE DID RELEASE THE AMERICAN

18
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:23,871
HOSTAGES AND IT LOOKED LIKE WE

19
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:24,872
WERE FULL STEAM AHEAD.

20
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:26,240
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

21
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,441
CHINA ANGLE HERE?

22
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:30,544
ALSO, IS IT SOMEWHAT, A LITTLE

23
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:31,846
MORE COMFORTING WHEN YOU

24
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:33,080
REALIZE OH, THIS IS THE KIM

25
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,549
JONG UN FAMILY WE KNOW?

26
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,051
WE HAVE RESPECT FOR THE

27
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,452
PROCESS, FOR THE SUMMIT BUT WE

28
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:40,754
ARE NOT GOING TO GO THERE AND

29
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:42,323
BE SNOOKERED.

30
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:43,724
>> THAT IS RIGHT, DANA.

31
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:44,258
LOOK.

32
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:45,593
CHINA OBVIOUSLY IS A BIG

33
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:46,794
PLAYER IN THE REGION.

34
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:48,395
THEY ARE ULTIMATELY THE BACKER

35
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:49,463
OF THE NORTH KOREA REGIME.

36
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:51,098
WITHOUT CHINA THERE IS NOTHING

37
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:51,599
FOR NORTH KOREA.

38
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:52,800
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUPPORT.

39
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,735
THEY ARE INCLINED TO GO WHERE

40
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,070
CHINA TELLS THEM TO GO.

41
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,571
IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE

42
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,506
AGGRESSIVE STATEMENT CAME

43
00:00:58,506 --> 00:00:59,740
AFTER MEETING WITH THE CHINA

44
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,441
LEADER.

45
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:01,742
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF HE SAID I

46
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:03,143
WANT TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE OR

47
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:04,745
CHINA SAID YOU NEED TO BE MORE

48
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:05,346
AGGRESSIVE.

49
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:06,714
EITHER WAY, WHAT YOU ARE

50
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:08,182
SEEING HERE IS TWO LEADERS

51
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:09,517
SORT OF GOING TOE TO TOE TO

52
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:10,951
SAY I CAN CANCEL, YOU CAN

53
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,553
CANCEL, I CAN TALK ABOUT

54
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:13,687
NUCLEAR WAR AND SO CAN YOU.

55
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:15,089
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHILE

56
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:16,457
THE TENSIONS HEATED UP A

57
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:19,994
LITTLE BIT, PRESIDENT CANCELED

58
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,896
THE SUMMIT BUT I BET IT'S BACK

59
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:22,830
OPEN IN TWO WEEKS.

60
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,797
>> Dana: THE PRESIDENT DID

61
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:25,099
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR THAT.

62
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,535
EVERY ACTOR HERE INVOLVED,

63
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,770
CHINA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA,

64
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,105
UNITED STATES AND CERTAINLY

65
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,807
NORTH KOREA ARE ACTING IN

66
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,142
THEIR COUNTRY'S BEST INTEREST.

67
00:01:35,142 --> 00:01:35,910
HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

68
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,444
WHY IS IT IN CHINA'S INTEREST

69
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,547
FOR THE SUMMIT NOT TO GO

70
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:40,014
FORWARD?

71
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,415
>> LOOK, AT THE END OF THE DAY

72
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:43,951
WHAT IS IN CHINA'S INTEREST IS

73
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,052
TO HAVE A NORTH KOREA THAT

74
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:46,687
COMES BACK IN LINE AND DOES

75
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:47,688
RIGHT THING HERE.

76
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:49,290
BUT ALSO NORTH KOREA THAT IS

77
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,659
STRONG RELATIVE TO SOUTH

78
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:51,992
KOREA.

79
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,460
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT

80
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,563
THEY SEE, THEY USE THE COLD

81
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:56,997
WAR TERMS.

82
00:01:56,997 --> 00:02:00,034
THE U.S. HAS A FEAR OF

83
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:00,401
INFLUENCE.

84
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:01,168
SOUTH KOREA.

85
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,303
CHINA, NORTH KOREA, SO THEY

86
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:03,037
NEED TO BALANCE IT OFF.

87
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:05,472
IF IT LOOKS LIKE TRUMP HAS THE

88
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:07,408
UPPER HAND CHINA SAYS WE WANT

89
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:07,975
YOU TO BACK OFF.

90
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:09,043
NORTH KOREA FEELS THE SAME

91
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:09,743
WAY.

92
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,779
SO NOT CLEAR IF IT'S CHINA

93
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:12,947
PULLING THE STRINGS OR NORTH

94
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:14,348
KOREA REACTING TO SAY WE WANT

95
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:16,050
TO DO THIS AND CHINA SAYS YEP,

96
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,251
THAT SOUNDS FINE TO US.

97
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:17,818
>> Dana: ANYTHING THE

98
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:19,453
PRESIDENT DOES COMES WITH SOME

99
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,255
CRITICISM FROM SOME PARTS OF

100
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,591
THE COUNTRY.

101
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:26,860
RICHARD HAAS FROM THE FOREIGN

102
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,463
POLICY CIRCLES TWEETED THE

103
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:31,398
SUMMIT WAS BOUND TO FAILED AS

104
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:32,866
TRUMP BADLY OVERESTIMATED WHAT

105
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,335
NORTH KOREA AGREE TO.

106
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,737
THE ISSUE IS AND WAS THE

107
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,472
U.S. WILLING TO ACCEPT OUTCOME

108
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,140
SHORT OF TOTAL

109
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,641
DENUCLEARIZATION.

110
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:41,775
ALL OR NOTHING FOREIGN POLICY

111
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,445
WITH NORTH KOREA, IRAN, CHINA,

112
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:47,081
TRADE RISKS PRODUCING NOTHING

113
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:48,649
BUT OR CONFLICT.

114
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,818
"I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK OF

115
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:51,352
THIS.

116
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,187
YOU WERE INSTRUMENTAL TO GUIDE

117
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:55,222
REPUBLICAN SIDE MEMBERS OF

118
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:56,557
CONGRESS AS PRESIDENT OBAMA

119
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:57,725
MOVED FORWARD ON THE IRAN

120
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:58,058
DEAL.

121
00:02:58,058 --> 00:02:59,426
WHAT PARALLELS DO YOU SEE

122
00:02:59,426 --> 00:02:59,893
HERE?

123
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:00,928
>> LOOK, YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK

124
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:02,329
ABOUT HALF MEASURES.

125
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:03,998
IF YOU WANT FOREIGN POLICY OF

126
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:07,368
HALF MEASURES, FINE.

127
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,436
DONALD TRUMP GOING FOR A BIG

128
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:09,837
PRIZE HERE.

129
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:10,938
THAT COMES WITH SOME COST.

130
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:12,106
EVERYONE WAS AMAZED THAT

131
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:13,841
DONALD TRUMP COULD PULL OFF A

132
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,742
BIG MEETING LIKE THIS.

133
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,343
I THINK IT STILL HAPPENS IN

134
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:18,012
THE LONG RUN BUT ON AMERICA'S

135
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:18,379
TERMS.

136
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,680
THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO

137
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,047
NEGOTIATE.

138
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:21,348
IF IT LOOKS LIKE WE WANT IT

139
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:22,650
TOO MUCH LIKE THE IRAN DEAL

140
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,951
THEY WILL STRING YOU OUT AND

141
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:25,419
GET A VARIETY OF CONCESSIONS.

142
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,920
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH

143
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,921
OBAMA AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

144
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,456
IT WON'T HAPPEN TO ME.

145
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,958
>> Dana: ISN'T THE ISSUE

146
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,960
HERE WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION

147
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,260
MEANS?

148
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,962
KIM JONG UN IS IN A STRONGER

149
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:35,929
POSITION BECAUSE HE NOW HAS

150
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:36,430
THE WEAPONS.

151
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,798
WE SAY NO, YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP

152
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:39,033
THE WEAPONS IF YOU WANT THE

153
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,167
OTHER THINGS THAT THE

154
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,535
PRESIDENT SAID COULD BE GOOD

155
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:44,638
FOR YOUR COUNTRY.

156
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,407
THE DEFINITION OF

157
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:47,675
"DENUCLEARIZATION" IS THE KEY

158
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:48,108
HERE.

159
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:48,742
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.

160
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:49,643
THAT IS THE KEY.

161
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,178
THE CHALLENGE HERE IS DONALD

162
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:52,413
TRUMP MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT

163
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:54,581
VIEW OF WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION

164
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,015
MEANS.

165
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,216
THE U.S. POSITION HAS BEEN NO

166
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:58,252
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE KOREAN

167
00:03:58,252 --> 00:03:58,886
PENINSULA, OUT COMPLETELY.

168
00:03:58,886 --> 00:03:59,987
KIM JONG UN MIGHT AGREE WITH

169
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:00,421
THAT.

170
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:02,589
BUT HE MAY MEAN I'LL

171
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:05,092
DENUCLEARIZE WHEN YOU

172
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:05,526
DENUCLEARIZE.

173
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:06,994
THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE

174
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:07,361
SCENARIO.

175
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,662
WE SEE WHAT IS MET HERE BUT

176
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:10,064
PART OF WHY YOU WANT TO GET TO

177
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:11,165
THE PLACE THEY ARE TALKING TO

178
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,032
ONE ANOTHER AND UNDERSTAND THE

179
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,667
TERMS BEFORE YOU GO IN

180
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,168
NEGOTIATIONS.

181
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:15,035
>> Dana: ONE THING THAT IS

182
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,704
DIFFERENT IS BEFORE THE WHOLE

183
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:17,738
PROCESS, BEFORE MIKE POMPEO

184
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,005
THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE HAD

185
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,374
GONE OVER TO NORTH KOREA,

186
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:21,041
ACTUALLY MET WITH HIM.

187
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,609
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF

188
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:23,043
RELATIONSHIP.

189
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:24,044
SO THAT IS DIFFERENT.

190
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,846
AND I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT.

191
00:04:25,846 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE PLACE AT
