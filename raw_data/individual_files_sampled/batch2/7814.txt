that's what's so odd about him is that he's this cult of personality even though these things seem you know manifestly clear he is oddly able to string together the right words in the right way or something and people respond to it you know yes I'm not sure that it is that weird I think that he's basically only doing a couple things right and of course these are very important and so there's huge lessons to be learned and imagine if someone smart did these things right so which is what was being said before the election because it was presuming that he wasn't going to win the election like the next time a smart guy is gonna con you read it's gonna be a clean car and a con or or it doesn't have to be a con it like you could if you're a good guy you can still do these things so let me explain right one is run towards the spotlight now I know a lot of good guys don't want to do that because it feels awkward and self-aggrandizing right but we're in a message war we're in an ideology war we're in a culture war it's true it's real right so if the left does not shirks away from the spotlight because they're trying to be good guys you're not helping anyone okay we need strong voices that's part of why I really really like Nina Turner who runs our revolution like she's not around
