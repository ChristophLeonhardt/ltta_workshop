thing one tonight Donald Trump is taking a break from his grand European tour of meeting and insulting world leaders and will be spending the pre Putin weekend playing golf at his Turnberry course in Scotland now the last time he was interned during in the summer of 2016 you might remember he gave a speech surrounded by dozens of little swastika golf balls was all thanks to a protester a British comedian named Simon who dumped a bucket on the lawn trying to pick them up is the best part of them of the bit get him out the crazy thing was that after that Trump went on to give his speech with the Nazi balls just sitting there on the ground that was then this is now but before his big return to the UK President Trump seemed to think this time would be different the people in the UK Scotland Ireland as you know I have property in Ireland that's property all over I think that those people they like me a lot let's - in fact he doesn't seem to know which countries are in the UK they like him so much hundreds of thousands of them packed the streets of London to greet him today and that thing - in 60 seconds Donald Trump seemed to think he would receive a pleasant welcome from the Brits when he arrived for his first visit at president this week and well it might not have been what he was expecting but someone did make this pretty awesome 650-foot crop circle for him to see from his helicopters it says F Trump in Russian and then today over a hundred thousand protesters and one giant inflatable duck nerd Trump baby crowded the streets of London the British cheeky sign game was in full effect many of them not exactly safe for family television our there was this one showing trump's face on a slice of toast and another declaring teapots not despots and this adorable little girl who wrote ruby drew thinks you are a poo maybe she just meant poo earns Donald Trump ended up avoiding London altogether he's at the Trump baby blimp made him feel unwelcome it was probably right about that I'm here because I hate you I hate this man I hate everything he does and everything he's sent the way that he treated women and families and the separation of the we believe that women should not be spoken to about all that in the way that he has Donald Trump is just the figurehead of the rise of the far right again it's an important thing to remember the lessons of history and where this kind of behavior leans I don't agree with anything that Trump stands for University I think they're children in cages was just the last straw he's so ludicrously impossibly awful leaves you speechless mr.
