DEMOCRATS NEWEST STARS IS A FOCUS OF TONIGHT ANGLE. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, THE MEDIA HAVE ANOINTED LIBERALS LIKE ANDREW GILLUM, GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE STACY ABRAMS AND TEXAS SENATORIAL CANDIDATE RITA O'ROURKE AS DEMOCRATIC SUPERSTARS TO WATCH. IS A STAR IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. GILLAM BRINGS SOMETHING. SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES, LIKE BETO AND GILLAM, YOU GET THE STAR POWER. Laura: IN THESE FINAL WEEKS OF CAMPAIGNING WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT ALL THREE CANDIDATES THAT SHOULD GIVE ALL THE VOTERS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES REASON TO QUESTION THE NONSTOP HEIGHT. LET'S START WITH ANDREW GILLUM. TEXT MESSAGES REVEAL THAT THE TALLAHASSEE MAYOR EXCEPTED A HOTEL ROOM, TOURS AND TICKETS TO THE BROADWAY SHOW HAMILTON FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS. WITHOUT EVER DISCLOSING THE GIFTS. ONLY THOSE DEVELOPERS WERE UNDERCOVER FBI AGENTS AND THE DEVELOPERS HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ME OR GILLAM ABOUT A REAL ESTATE PROJECT IN TALLAHASSEE. HIS OPPONENT RON DeSANTIS REPUBLICAN, CONFRONTED HIM WITH ALL THIS AT THEIR DEBATE ON SUNDAY. THE QUESTION IS, DID YOU PAY FOR THE HAMILTON TICKET OR DID THE UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT PAY? I'M A HARDWORKING PERSON, AND I KNOW THAT MAY NOT FIT YOUR DESCRIPTION OF WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ME DO BUT I WORK HARD FOR EVERYTHING I'VE GOTTEN IN MY LIFE AND I DON'T NEED ANYONE HANDING ANYTHING TO ME FOR FREE. Laura: IT GILLAM GOT A DIFFERENT ANSWER WITH CHUCK TODD YESTERDAY. WITH FLORIDA VOTERS AFTER 15 YEARS, I SERVED HONORABLY, RESPECTIVELY, AND HAVE SERVED MY COMMUNITY WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A STAIN ON MY RECORD OR ON THE NAME. Laura: HE SPINNING AS BADLY. AND TEXT MESSAGES JUST RELEASED BY GILLAM'S LOBBYIST FRIEND, HE'S TOLD CLEARLY ON AUGUST 10TH OF THE 16TH THAT MIKE MILLER AND CREW HAVE TICKETS TO HAMILTON AT 8:00 P.M. AWESOME NEWS, GILLAM TEXTED IN RESPONSE. NOW WHETHER HIS BROTHER GAVE HIM A TICKET OR NOT, HE KNEW THE SOURCE OF THE TICKET. WE SUPPOSE A DEVELOPER WHO NEEDED HIS HELP. THIS IS WHY THE STATE OF FLORIDA ETHICS COMMISSION INVESTIGATED GALEN. THE PROBE REMAINS OPEN AND THE DEMOCRATS FLORIDA STAR SEEMS TO BE FALLING. TONIGHT AT HIS SECOND AND LAST DEBATE AGAINST DISANTO'S, GILLAM WAS PRESSED ON THE ISSUE AND THINGS GOT HOT. HE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE HE'S NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION. I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT HAVING ASKED MORE QUESTIONS. I'M RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR AND IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA WE GOT A LOT OF ISSUES. NICE TRY, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS. I SUGGEST THAT GILLAM MOVES TO SAN FRANCISCO WHERE HIS VIEWS AND HIS STYLE OF POLITICS WOULD FIT PERFECTLY. NOW LET'S MOVE ONTO THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. IN GEORGIA WHERE THIS VIDEO FOOTAGE OF GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE STACY ABRAMS SURFACE. NOW IT SHOWS HER AND OTHERS ON THE STEPS OF THE GEORGIA CAPITAL EARNING THE STATE FLAG IN PROTEST. THAT WAS 1992. ABRAM SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN HER FLAG TORCHING THIS WAY. 26 YEARS AGO AS A COLLEGE FRESHMAN, I ALONG WITH MANY OTHER GEORGIANS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA WERE DEEPLY DISTURBED BY THE RACIAL D DISTURBED BY THE RACIAL V DISTURBED BY THE RACIAL S DISTURBED BY THE RACIAL V DISTURBED BY THE RACIAL N DISTURBED BY THE RACIAL S THAT WERE IN THAT STATE FLAG WITH THE CONFEDERATE SYMBOL. Laura: LET ME BE TRUE BUT THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA AT THE TIME DID NOT SET THE FLAG ON FIRE ON THE CAPITOL STEPS. HE WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO AMEND THE FLAG, CHANGE IT AND REMOVE THE CONFEDERATE SYMBOL THAT PEOPLE FOUND OFFENSIVE. SO DOES A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR CONSIDER IT RIGHT TO SIMPLY DESTROY PUBLIC IMAGES OR SYMBOLS THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS FIND OFFENSIVE? THAT'S A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA HAVE TO ANSWER. AND THEN, THERE IS SUPER BETO. YES, SOME STREET ARTIST IS TRYING TO DEPICT O'ROURKE, WHOSE REAL NAME IS ROBERT FRANCIS, AS SOME KIND OF SUPER HERO BUT HIS ACTIONS BELIE THE DESIGNATION. BACK IN 1998 WHEN THE TEXAS SENATORIAL CANDIDATE WAS 26, HE WAS DRINKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE DRIVING AND HE STRUCK ANOTHER CAR AND ATTEMPTED TO FLEE THE ACCIDENT. SINCE THEN, HE TRIED TO SOFT PEDDLED THE DRIVING DRUNK, WHICH I DID IT COME AS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE FOR WHICH THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION OR EXCUSE. Laura: YOU SHOULD ALSO NOT TRY TO EXCUSE YOURSELF FROM ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT, WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY YOUR INTENTION. NOW WHEN ARRESTING HIM IN, "THE DRIVER ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE THE ACCIDENT, BUT WAS STOPPED BY THE WITNESS." NICE TRY, SUPERMAN. AND I HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED HIS 1995 BURGLARY CHARGES FOR BREAKING INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT EL PASO, OR THIS HEINOUS COMMERCIAL. MUSICAL PHYSICAL Laura: MORE LIKE LEADER OF THE HACK. AS VOTERS HAD TO THE POLLS, IT WOULD SERVE THEM WELL TO SEE THROUGH THE LIBERAL MEDIA PIXIE DUST ABOUT ALL OF THE SO-CALLED DEMOCRATIC SUPERSTARS. WHO THESE PEOPLE REALLY ARE, CHECK IT OUT. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN. OPEN BORDERS, HIGHER TAXES, GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE, GUN-CONTROL, AND MORE REGULATIONS ON BUSINESS. ALSO REMEMBER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT STARS, WHO ARE ACTUALLY SEEING THE LIGHT REFLECTED FROM A STAR
