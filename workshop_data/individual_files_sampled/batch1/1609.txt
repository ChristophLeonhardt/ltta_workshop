if throughout his trip the israeli-palestinian conflict didn't seem a priority in a man the newly appointed US Secretary of State was reminded it remains the main stumbling block towards achieving regional peace the two-state solution remains the only path to that pieces we believe in Jordan it is the solution that would allow for the emergence of our an independent sovereign Palestine States Jordanian leaders are also worried about the imminent move of the u.s. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem but Pompeo maintained that final boundaries within Jerusalem are up for negotiation with respect to the two-state solution the parties will ultimately make the decision about what the right resolution is we certainly open to a 2-2 party solution that's a likely outcome we certainly believe that the Israelis and Palestinians needs to need to have political engagement there was no condemnation however of the recent demonstrations along the Gaza border fence where Israeli snipers shot unarmed protesters killing dozens and injuring hundreds po'pay are limited himself to saying that Israel had the right to defend itself didn't seem to share the Jordanian view that the israeli-palestinian conflict is the main source of instability in the Middle East instead he pointed to other conflicts in the region but throughout his trip it was clear that Iran and the uncertain future of the nuclear deal were the immediate priority for the US administration in Riyadh and Tel Aviv Mike Pompeo ramped up the rhetoric on Iran threat to Middle East ability to the delight of his hosts Iran destabilizes this entire region it supports proxy militias and terrorist groups in arms it is an arms dealer to the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran conducts cyber hacking campaigns and it supports the murderous Assad regime as well Iranian missiles are also a concern of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu his focus on the risk of them being fired from Iranian bases in Syria and by Hezbollah from Lebanon Netanyahu apparently couldn't be more pleased with pompiers appointment grinning and warmly congratulating him their language at times interchangeable we remain deeply concerned about Iran's dangerous escalation of threats to Israel and the region and Iran's ambition to dominate the Middle East who remains if people thought that Iran's aggression would be moderated as a result of signing the deal the opposite has happened and Iran is trying to gobble up one country after the other Pompeyo has flown back to Washington but if tough talk on Iran please sum the lack of significant commitment to resolving the longest-running Middle Eastern conflict will worry others Haddad l-habib al Jazeera
