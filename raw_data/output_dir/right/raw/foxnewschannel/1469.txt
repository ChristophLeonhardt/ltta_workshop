EXPLOSION.

9
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:21,970
I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,005
SPECTACULAR BUT THERE ARE NO

11
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,941
INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TO CONFIRM

12
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:27,008
THE CLAIMS.

13
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,244

00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:47,562
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID PERPLEXED

20
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:50,665
BY THE NEWS.

21
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,968
HE SAID DENUCLEARIZATION CAN'T

22
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:55,871
BE DELAYED OR ABANDONED.

23
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:58,640
MOON HAS MOVED TO BRING THE

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,842
CRISIS TO A DIMLY MAT I CAN

25
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:02,377
RESOLUTION INCLUDING HIS OWN

26
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:10,385

00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:22,063
>> REGIONAL OBSERVES ARE HOPING

31
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:22,764
OUT HOPE.

32
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:26,234
FOR NOW AT LEAST THEY SAY

33
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,770
>> THIS IS A HUGE BUMP IN THE

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,271
ROAD.

35
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,939
I SUPPOSE WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT

36
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,743
TO SEE WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN

37
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:37,145
REACTION IS AND THE REACTION OF

38
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:38,079
OTHER PLAYERS AS WELL.

WE HAVEN'T HAD A REACTION YET

42
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,225
FROM THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT

43
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:51,626
TO THE WHITE HOUSE MOVES.

44
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:53,862
THE REGIME HAS GOTTEN BETTER

45
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:56,398
WITH THEIR REACTION TIME,

46
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:56,765
RECENTLY.

47
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,934
THEY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT

48
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:01,036
IS NEXT AFTER THIS WHITE HOUSE

49
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:01,403
