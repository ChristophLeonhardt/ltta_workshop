>> TWO MORE WORKING DAYS UNTIL
MONDAY.
>> IN YOUR JOB, YES.
HAVE FUN.
THANK YOU, JOHN ROBERTS.
>> Jon: WELL, BACK IN THE
NATION'S CAPITOL, THINGS ARE
BOILING ONCE AGAIN.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS, DEVIN NUNES
AND TREY GOWDY MEETING WITH
SENIOR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
OFFICIALS LOOKING FOR CLASSIFIED
DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.
KIM STRASSEL WRITING AN OP-ED IN
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."
IT READS --
>> Jon: THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
IS PUSHING BACK ON THE NARRATIVE
TELLING FOX NEWS THAT THEY ONLY
BRIEFED THE LAWMAKERS AND DID
NOT REVEAL ANY SOURCES OR LEFT
THEM READ ACTUAL DOCUMENTS.
KIM STRASSEL, "WALL STREET
JOURNAL" AND FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR JOINS US NOW.
ONE OF THOSE STUNNING
REVELATIONS THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE OUR
VIEWERS TO CHECK OUT YOUR PIECE
IN THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"
ONE OF THOSE REVELATIONS IS YOU
SAY THE FBI OUTRIGHT HID
DOCUMENTS FROM CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATORS.
>> WELL, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
HI, JON, BY THE WAY.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN WHO IN A PRESS
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY POINTED OUT
THAT THIS REQUEST BY DEVIN NUNES
AND TREY GOWDY WAS WHOLLY
APPROPRIATE AND WITHIN THE SCOPE
OF THEIR ONGOING INVESTIGATION.
FRANKLY, SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ANSWERED QUITE A WHILE AGO.
THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING
WHATEVER THIS IS ENTIRELY
RELEVANT TO THE LONG-STANDING
PROBE THAT THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN
CONDUCTING INTO THE FBI'S
HANDLING OF THE RUSSIA COLLUSION
INVESTIGATION.
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT, THEY KNEW FULL WELL
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE HANDED
OVER WHATEVER IT IS THAT THESE
TWO MEN ARE SEEKING, ALL THE WAY
BACK LAST SUMMER WHEN THEY WERE
REQUESTED FOR DOCUMENTS IN
AUGUST.
>> Jon: BUT THE FBI HAS BEEN
STONE-WALLING OR CONCEALING WHAT
THEY HAVE, RIGHT?
>> WELL, FOR MONTHS NOW, LOOK
HOW THEY HANDLED THE INITIAL
SUBPOENA.
THEY IGNORED IT AND DELAYED.
REMEMBER, ALL OF THE EXCUSES.
THIS COULD HARM NATIONAL
SECURITY, THIS COULD UNDERMINE
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
INTELLIGENCE PARTNERS WHAT WE
HAVE SEEN SO FAR SHOW THAT NONE
OF THAT IS THE CASE.
WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY HIDING
WERE REVELATIONS THAT WERE
HUGELY EMBARRASSING TO THE
ANYBODY.
FOR INSTANCE, THE FACT THAT THEY
DIDN'T FULLY INFORM THE FISA
COURT ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS
BASING ITS SURVEILLANCE WARRANT
ON INFORMATION THAT CAME FROM
THE RIVAL PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
>> Jon: AND THE INDICATIONS ARE
THAT THE FBI HAD A SOURCE WITHIN
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT WAS
FEEDING THEM INFORMATION?
>> WELL, AT LEAST INTERACTING
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
WHAT WE KNOW FROM A LEAK THAT
APPEARS TO HAVE COME FROM LAW
ENFORCEMENT IS THAT THEY'RE
REQUESTING INFORMATION ABOUT A
SOURCE.
THAT TERM IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
WHEN THE FBI TALKS ABOUT A
SOURCE, THEY TALK ABOUT SOMEONE
THAT IS YOUR AVERAGE CITIZEN
THAT USES THEIR CREDENTIALS OR
THEIR JOB AS A WAY OF SPYING FOR
THE AGENCY.
SO WE CAN TAKE THAT TO MEAN THAT
THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT WAS
INTERACTING WITH THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN IN SOME WAY AND
REPORTING BACK TO THE FBI.
WHICH MEANS THE FBI WAS USING
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO SPY ON A
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
>> Jon: THAT GOES BACK TO THE
WHOLE UNMASKING CONTROVERSY.
THE FBI ONLY MASKS THOSE NAMES
BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT
THE INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE
FOUND THAT IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO
WHATEVER THEY'RE INVESTIGATING.
WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
THEN UNMASKS THOSE NAMES, IT WAS
ESSENTIALLY REVEALING
INFORMATION THAT THE FBI HAD
ALREADY DEEMED WAS NOT RELEVANT.
>> WELL, THESE ARE PROTECTIONS
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR
AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO ARE
INTERACTING WITH FOREIGNERS.
WE'RE ALLOWED TO KEEP TRACK OF
WHAT THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IS
SAYING ON A PHONE.
WE HAVE THOSE SPYING TOOLS.
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE USING
THOSE TOOLS TO OBSERVE
AMERICANS.
SO WE MASK THOSE NAMES.
WE HAD THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
UNMASKING, WE NOW KNOW THAT
THERE WAS A SURVEILLANCE WARRANT
AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN.
WE NOW BELIEVE BASED ON THIS
THAT THEY POTENTIALLY HAD HUMAN
PEOPLE SPYING.
THIS IS AMAZING AND OUTRAGEOUS
STUFF, ESPECIALLY THIS IS A
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SUPPOSED TO
TREAD CAREFULLY SO THAT THEY
INFLUENCING OR GETTING INVOLVED
IN AN ELECTION.
>> Jon: SO MY FINAL QUESTION, IF
YOU COULD ASK ONE QUESTION OF
THE FBI AND GET AN ANSWER TO IT,
WHAT WOULD IT BE?
>> WELL, IT WOULD BE FOR THIS
NAME AND TO COME CLEAN ABOUT
EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN
TERMS OF ALL OF ITS SURVEILLANCE
AND MONITORING AND INVESTIGATION
OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO SEE
THIS.
>> Jon: HER PIECE IS ENTITLED
