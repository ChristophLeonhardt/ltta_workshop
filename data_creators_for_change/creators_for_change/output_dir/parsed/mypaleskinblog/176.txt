Hey
so I thought today that I would take you
with me to be
so I've never eaten food
so this is a very first one that I'm
going to I thought why not take you guys
with me and show you what I'm going to
experience today
everyone like never get the tube
anywhere but I thought that today it's
easier I'm gonna get the tube and and I
think I'm gonna get off but not in
tailgate and when I got there I'm gonna
get a cap to canvas in Olympia so let's
see how it goes
I'm just throwing myself in at 55 and
okay but I don't know I'm here but I
drank myself ass today
so I need to go get a cab I don't know
why okay not in health gate would be a
good idea I didn't luckily I'm just
gonna go and try and find a cab Bay I
think I found one over there I'm gonna
jump in a cab and then go to BC : we're
excited to see what the day because I
spent like half hour doing this
eyeshadow I'm not gonna cover it up with
one day I have like no idea what to
expect today I'm not gonna lie I've
never been to a youtuber convention
don't really know what to expect I went
to see I went to the Korean audience
like it's so weird how you gave it and
you'll know like everyone there that we
won't know them so that was kind of
where there was so many people there I
saw make up my Monday was there Carli
bybel was there so many people hopefully
excited to meet sometime today I had to
just generally share with you today the
first people to come and find us
we are going to give this tensor time
Instagram saying
comments like tricky sign say
we're just alike
we're very excited to be here
every day
no I can't what's going on
I don't even know what
like we're in Wells we are
I
you
like the icons how much I think she got
the fruit like now yeah
I'm hopefully going
I don't know what to do I'm just going
to say it's like ages and until ow
some fun okay
I'm high
a 13 year old girl from fangirl moment
I
a meeting
like that is insane
very light
wait
no I didn't buy a brand new brush that
coming soon
I love proper
making against the eyeshadow brushes
you
the benefit
like people
we're gonna go to the benefit
so pretty
it's so freaking pretty
the thing we're gonna like check out the
better bits time and then I might go get
my nails done
six lounge as well
I am like the world's worst vlogger I
had the most mental time at beautycon I
had no idea what to expect when I well I
don't know I don't know why it was same
mental to me but like I absolutely loved
it I had so much fun and I met so many
creators I say met I mean like they came
up to me I just kind of have this fear
of talking to new people and it really
does annoy me and it just really does
kind of irritate and anger me because
I'm home now and I have so much regret
for not you know going up to people and
talking to them like Tyler Oakley was
there Claire Marshall was there you know
Carli bybel was there did I go and talk
to them no I didn't and I feel like an
absolute idiot now for not doing that
and it's hard because it's so simple to
go up to someone and say hi I'm M oh hey
you know I really like your channel and
it's such a simple thing to do I just
have I just can't do it I'm trying and
that's you know that's all that's all I
can do and I'm so I feel so thankful
that you know hey people come up and
people approach me and they say hi or
they introduce themselves to me my
eyelash is falling off or this I swear
to god my eyelash is falling off I
obviously don't want to just not be able
to talk to new people and I know that if
I get one-on-one with someone then I'm
totally good and I can talk to them and
I can talk to them for like five to ten
minutes about anything and everything I
think what I find the hardest about it
is that I know that if I'm in a work
environment and it's somebody that I've
never met before but I have to talk to
them about work then I can do it and I
know that sounds ridiculous but
can I can I can talk to them there
because I'm talking about work as soon
as it comes to like introducing myself
and to look into somebody that I don't
know about something that I'm so
passionate about I just can't do and
it's so frustrating and I honestly wish
that wasn't the case and people are like
oh my god it's so easy you just say hi
or you just talk to the bucket but the
full if doing that like actually like
finds life fat on me sometimes
um sometimes it going comes and goes and
it's like frickin ridiculous that I
can't just go up to people and say hi I
really like your channel can I have a
selfie with you I can do it to the
camera but when it comes to like
beautycon and it comes to like people
that I really look up to and people that
I really respect and I just fail
miserably I'm really sorry that I don't
I have footage of me with loads of the
youtubers or any of the big kind of
youtubers from the states because I was
too scared to talk to them apart from
the fact that I was too scared to talk
to any of the youtubers I love i really
enjoyed beautycon and i do I don't know
if I really expected to enjoy it I'm
really rambling now I I'm not very good
so if you're watching this I haven't
anything up the vlog that much and it's
actually gonna see the light of day
so I hope it wasn't too bad I really
hope it wasn't too bad and thanks for
watching and I hope you didn't
absolutely hate this style of video and
I hope I didn't talk too much crap and
I'll see you guys soon bye
