00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:09,742

NEW YORK.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,514
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,049
APPEAR AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,950

00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,252
TRILLION SPENDING BILL THAT 

9
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,187
CONGRESS PASSED OVERNIGHT.

THIS IS AFTER ISSUING A SURPRISE

00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:22,822
VETO THREAT ON TWITTER THIS 

12
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:23,389

00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:30,763
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 

15
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:35,568
EVERYBODY.

16
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,705
WE HAVE A

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,272
LOT OF GOOD NEWS TO REPORT.

18
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:43,676
TREMENDOUS TRADE DEALS ARE BEING

19
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,012
MADE WITH VAERRIOUS COUNTRIES.

20
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,213
WE'RE NEGOTIATING VERY LONG, 

21
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,483
VERY HARD, BUT VERY QUICKLY.

22
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:54,287
AND THE DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA, 

23
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:58,791
ACCORDING TO SECRETARY ROSS AND 

24
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,993
BOB LIGHTHEISER IS VERY CLOSE TO

25
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:02,328
BEING FINISHED AND WE'RE GOING 

26
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,931
TO HAVE A WONDERFUL DEAL WITH A 

27
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:05,832
WONDERFUL ALLY.

28
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,534
WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO IT.

29
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,101
IT WAS A DEAL THAT WAS CAUSING A

30
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,904
LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR OUR COUNTRY 

31
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:13,105
IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND IN 

32
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:16,576
TERMS OF LOTS OF OTHER THINGS.

33
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,577
I MIGHT ASK SECRETARY ROSS TO 

34
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,011
JUST SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THAT 

35
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:22,315
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET ONTO

36
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,749
THIS RIDICULOUS SITUATION THAT 

37
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,185
TOOK PLACE OVER THE LAST WEEK.

38
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:29,989
SO, SECRETARY ROSS.

39
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:34,460
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

40
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,128
WE BELIEVE WE ARE RELATIVELY 

41
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,799
CLOSE TO A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE 

42
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,769
RESOLUTION WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN

43
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,102
GOVERNMENT.

44
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,673
IT WOULD ENCOMPASS, IF IT GOES 

45
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,610
THROUGH, BOTH THE 232s AND 

46
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,379
BROADER TRADE ISSUES.

47
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,881
WE HOPE BY SOME TIME NEXT WEEK 

48
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:55,415
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A REAL 

49
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,319
ANNOUNCEMENT.

50
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,819
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

51
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:07,126
I APPRECIATE IT.

52
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,961
THE LAST TIME WE NEGOTIATED 

53
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,196
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND AS YOU 

54
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,664
KNOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM 

55
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,099
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

56
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,900
THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEY 

57
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,569
CREATE A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS 

58
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,938
THAT NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO READ 

59
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,673
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST DONE.

60
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,909
YOU TELL ME WHO CAN READ THAT 

61
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,243
QUICKLY.

62
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,245
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO READ IT.

63
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,879
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, DEEP 

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,251
DEFENSE CUTS HAVE UNDERMINED OUR

65
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,752
NATIONAL SECURITY.

66
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,054
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S TAKEN OUT,

67
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,122
THEY'VE HALLOWED OUR READINESS 

68
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:40,459
AS A MILITARY UNIT AND PUT 

69
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,862
AMERICA AT REALLY GRAVE RISK.

70
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:47,934
MY HIGHEST DUTY IS TO KEEP 

71
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:48,534
AMERICA SAFE.

72
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,802
NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT.

73
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:54,507
THE OMNIBUS BILL REVERSES THIS 

74
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,475
DANGEROUS DEFENSE.

75
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,942
AS CRAZY AS IT'S BEEN, AS 

76
00:02:56,942 --> 00:03:00,112
DIFFICULT AS IT'S BEEN, AS MUCH 

77
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:02,281
OPPOSITION TO THE MILITARY AS 

78
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:04,817
WE'VE HAD FROM THE DEMOCRATS AND

79
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,285
IT HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS, I TRIED 

80
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,553
TO EXPLAIN TO THEM, YOU KNOW, 

81
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:08,954
THE MILITARY IS FOR REPUBLICANS 

82
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,789
AND DEMOCRATS AND EVERYBODY 

83
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:12,358
ELSE.

84
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,927
IT'S FOR EVERYBODY.

85
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,095
BUT WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 

86
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,698
OPPOSITION TO CREATING REALLY 

87
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,433
WHAT WILL BE THE FAR -- BY FAR 

88
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,000
THE STRONGEST MILITARY THAT 

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,003
WE'VE EVER HAD.

90
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,106
WE'VE HAD THAT FROM THE 

91
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:27,373
DEMOCRATS.

92
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,442
SO IF WE TAKE SOMETHING FOR THE 

93
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,843
MILITARY, THEY WANT SOMETHING 

94
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,445
FOR, INN MANY CASES, THINGS THA 

95
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:36,282
ARE REALLY A WASTED SUM OF 

96
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:36,582
MONEY.

97
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:37,216
IT'S NOT RIGHT AND IT'S VERY BAD

98
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,320
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

99
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,256
WE'RE LOOKING TO DO FUNDING FOR 

100
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,825
OUR FINAL FIGHT IN CERTAIN 

101
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,058
AREAS.

102
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,527
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOTTEN JUST 

103
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,764
ABOUT 100% OF OUR LAND BACK FROM

104
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,965
ISIS.

105
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,500
WE HAVE TROOP INCREASES 

106
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,301
NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE 

107
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,604
HAVE TO DO, AND WE HAVE VERY 

108
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,938
IMPORTANTLY A PAY INCREASE FOR 

109
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:00,506
OUR TROOPS.

110
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,807
AND THIS WILL BE ACTUALLY THE 

111
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:09,115
LARGEST PAY INCREASE FOR OUR 

112
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,217
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN OVERA  A 

113
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,152
DECADE.

114
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,421
IT INCREASES DEFENSE SPENDING BY

115
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,857
OVER $60 BILLION AND FUNDS 

116
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,291
SHIPS, PLANES, HELICOPTERS, 

117
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,760
TANKS AND SUBMARINES.

118
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,461
WE HAVE SUBMARINES BEING BUILT, 

119
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:24,230
THE LIKES OF WHICH THERE'S 

120
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,997
NOTHING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 

121
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,832
LIKE THE SUBMARINES WE BUILD.

122
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,434
OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS THE 

123
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,635
BEST EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD, AND

124
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,570
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAW TWO 

125
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,971
DAYS AGO WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND 

126
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:35,174
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, SAUDI 

127
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,475
ARABIA AS AN EXAMPLE IS BUYING 

128
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:37,343
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

129
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,980
WORTH OF OUR EQUIPMENT.

130
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,947
WE'RE GETTING VERY FAST 

131
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,349
APPROVALS ON THAT.

132
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,717
THEREFORE, AS A MATTER OF 

133
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,152
NATIONAL SECURITY, I'VE SIGNED 

134
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:51,591
THIS OMNIBUS BUDGET BILL.

135
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,391
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT 

136
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,861
I'M UNHAPPY ABOUT IN THIS BILL.

137
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,896
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT 

138
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,532
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD IN THIS 

139
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,500
BILL, BUT WE WERE IN A SENSE 

140
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,202
FORCED IF WE WANTED TO BUILD OUR

141
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,871
MILITARY, WE WERE FORCED TO HAVE

142
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,037
IT.

143
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,439
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE 

144
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,807
SHOULD HAVE IN THE BILL.

145
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,875
BUT I SAY TO CONGRESS I WILL 

146
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,976
NEVER SIGN ANOTHER BILL LIKE 

147
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:11,443
THIS AGAIN.

148
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,847
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

149
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,216
NOBODY READ IT.

150
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,585
IT'S ONLY HOURS OLD.

151
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,022
SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW -- 

152
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,191
$1.3 TRILLION, IT'S THE SECOND 

153
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,159
LARGEST EVER.

154
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,126
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED ONE THAT 

155
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,361
WAS ACTUALLY LARGER, WHICH I'M 

156
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:29,962
SURE HE WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH 

157
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,232
EITHER.

158
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,934
BUT IN THIS CASE, IT BECAME SO 

159
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,168
BIG BECAUSE WE NEED TO TAKE CARE

160
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:41,774
OF OUR MILITARY AND BECAUSE THE 

161
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,277
DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN 

162
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,311
THAT ADDED THINGS THAT THEY 

163
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,647
WANTED IN ORDER TO GET THEIR 

164
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:47,847
VOTES.

165
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,583
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE 

166
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,818
FILIBUSTER RULE.

167
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,287
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE 

168
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:55,855
FILIBUSTER RULE.

169
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,388
AND GO TO 51 VOTES IN THE 

170
00:05:56,388 --> 00:06:00,560
SENATE.

171
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,795
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REALLY 

172
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,963
SUSTAINED, CONTINUED SUCCESS.

173
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,366
DACA RECIPIENTS HAVE BEEN 

174
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,734
TREATED EXTREMELY BADLY BY THE 

175
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:09,168
DEMOCRATS.

176
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,270
WE WANTED TO INCLUDE DACA.

177
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,672
WE WANTED TO HAVE THEM IN THIS 

178
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,875
BILL.

179
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,444
800,000 PEOPLE, AND ACTUALLY IT 

180
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,579
COULD EVEN BE MORE, AND WE 

181
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,482
WANTED TO INCLUDE DACA IN THIS 

182
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,616
BILL.

183
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,883
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD NOT DO IT.

184
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:29,355
THEY WOULD NOT DO IT.

185
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,158
TO PREVENT THE OMNIBUS SITUATION

186
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,527
FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN, I'M 

187
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,997
CALLING ON CONGRESS TO GIVE ME A

188
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,431
LINE ITEM VETO FOR ALL 

189
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,767
GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILLS, AND 

190
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:45,538
THE SENATE MUST END, THEY MUST 

191
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,938
END THE FILIBUSTER RULE AND GET 

192
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:50,176
DOWN TO WORK.

193
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,777
WE HAVE TO GET A LOT OF GREAT 

194
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:52,745
LEGISLATION APPROVED, AND 

195
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,279
WITHOUT THE FILIBUSTER RULE, IT 

196
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,151
WILL HAPPEN JUST LIKE MAGIC.

197
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,387
I WANT TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION 

198
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:06,892
ON BORDER SECURITY WHICH I CALL 

199
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:07,627
NATIONAL DEFENSE.

200
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,528
I CALL IT STOPPING DRUGS FROM 

201
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:13,065
POURING ACROSS OUR BORDER, AND I

202
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,433
CALL IT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

203
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,969
IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

204
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,371
BUT NATIONAL DEFENSE IS A VERY 

205
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,874
IMPORTANT TWO WORDS BECAUSE BY 

206
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,777
HAVING A STRONG BORDER SYSTEM, 

207
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:33,019
INCLUDING A WALL, WE ARE IN A 

208
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,686
POSITION MILITARILY THAT IS VERY

209
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,189
ADVANTAGEOUS.

210
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:38,391
BEFORE I GET OFF OF THAT 

211
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,461
SUBJECT, I'D LIKE TO ASK 

212
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,663
SECRETARY MATTIS TO TALK ABOUT 

213
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,666
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN TERMS

214
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,734
OF THE MILITARY, BECAUSE THERE 

215
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,802
HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE 

216
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,070
WE'VE BEEN ABLE DO.

217
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,073
OUR MILITARY WAS VERY DEPLETED, 

218
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,641
BUT IT'S RAPIDLY GETTING BETTER 

219
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,176
AND IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT

220
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,644
WILL BE STRONGER THAN IT HAS 

221
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,211
EVER BEEN.

222
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,479
SO I'D LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY 

223
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,046
MATTIS TO SAY A FEW WORDS, 

224
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:04,283
PLEASE.

225
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,853
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

226
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,555
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN 1790 IN

TO BE PREPARED FOR WAR IS ONE OF

230
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,394
THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF 

231
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,297
PRESERVING THE PEACE.

232
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,399
AS THE PRESIDENT NOTED, TODAY WE

233
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,602
RECEIVED THE LARGEST MILITARY 

234
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,905
BUDGET IN HISTORY, REVERSING 

235
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,040
MANY YEARS OF DECLINE AND 

236
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,075
UNPREDICTABLE FUNDING.

237
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:29,975
TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 

238
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,979
OUR MILITARY STRONGER THAN EVER.

239
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,246
WE IN THE MILITARY ARE HUMBLED 

240
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,315

241
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:36,782

WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS THUS 

247
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:43,655

00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:47,593
BYRON.

251
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,228
THE CONGRESS PASSED THIS BILL.

252
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,963

260
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,241

BILL.

264
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,516
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF, REALLY BY 

265
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,117
ANY STANDARD A LOT BUT NOT BY 

266
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:13,653
THIS STANDARD BUT WE'RE GOING TO

267
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,354
MAKE IT GO A LONG WAY.

268
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,922
WE HAVE A LOT OF MONEY COMING TO

269
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,524
THE BORDER AND IT WILL BE COMING

270
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,458
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.

271
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,961
WE FUNDED THE INITIAL PAYMENT OF

272
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,628
$1.6 BILLION.

273
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,063
WE'RE GOING TO BE STARTING WORK 

274
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,933
LITERALLY ON MONDAY ON NOT ONLY 

275
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:31,036
SOME NEW WALL, NOT ENOUGH BUT 

276
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,539
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT VERY 

277
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,640
QUICKLY, BUT ALSO FIXING 

278
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,444
EXISTING WALLS AND EXISTING 

279
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,078
ACCEPTABLE FENCES.

280
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,445
THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT YOU 

281
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:41,414
HAVE TO SEE THROUGH.

282
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,717
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE 

283
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,351
THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE IN ORDER 

284
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,284
TO SEE WHAT'S COMING, AND IN 

285
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,720
MANY CASES IT'S NOT A PRETTY 

286
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,522
PICTURE WHEN YOU LOOK.

287
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,057
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE 

288
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:51,323
IT.

289
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:55,428
SO WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION FOR THE 

290
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:55,828
WALL.

291
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,429
THAT WILL START IMMEDIATELY.

292
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,332
THIS IS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING BUT

293
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:01,367
IT'S IMMEDIATE.

294
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,002
IT STARTS IMMEDIATELY, AND I'D 

295
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:07,272
LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY NIELSEN TO

296
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,474
SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT WE'VE

297
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:10,509
DONE IN TERMS OF HOMELAND 

298
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,410
SECURITY AND WHAT THE BILL DOES 

299
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,877
FOR HOMELAND SECURITY.

300
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:16,882
THANK YOU.

301
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,216
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.

302
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,518
WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

303
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,253
SECURITY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH 

304
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,122
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND WE

305
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,389
SUPPORT THIS OMNIBUS IN THE 

306
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,558
DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY.

307
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,392
AS THE PRESIDENT HAS STATED, 

308
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,794
UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP HE HAS 

309
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,628
DELIVERED FOR THE AMERICAN 

310
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:29,861
PEOPLE.

311
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:31,563
THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT ON A 

312
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:32,631
BORDER WALL SYSTEM.

313
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,501
THIS IS A 10% INCREASE FOR 

314
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,102
IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT.

315
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:39,037
THIS WILL HELP US IMPROVE OUR 

316
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,038
AVIATION SECURITY WITH SOME 

317
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:41,840
BADLY NEEDED UPGRADES, AND WE 

318
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,175
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH 

319
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,877
CONGRESS ON ADDITIONAL NEEDS 

320
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,478
THAT WE HAVE.

321
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,280
I WILL SAY, HOWEVER, THAT IT'S 

322
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,047
UNFORTUNATE THAT CONGRESS CHOSE 

323
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,549
NOT TO LISTEN TO THE MEN AND 

324
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,718
WOMEN OF DHS AND THOSE OR THE 

325
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,552
FRONT LINES.

326
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,920
THEY TOLD US HOW TO BUILD THE 

327
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,321
WALL, WHERE TO BUILD THE WALL 

328
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,389
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 

329
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,423
WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 

330
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,092
WALL IS WHERE WE NEED IT, HOW WE

331
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,127
NEED IT AS THE PRESIDENT 

332
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,394
DESCRIBED, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

333
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,963
IT SERVES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

334
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:05,630
AND SERVES THE SECURITY OF THIS 

335
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:05,864
NATION.

336
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:06,798
WE ALSO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 

337
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,934
WITH CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE 

338
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,135
DANGEROUS LOOPHOLES THAT THE 

339
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,136
PRESIDENT HAS MENTIONED MANY 

340
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:11,937
TIMES AND TO CONTINUE TO 

341
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,973
INCREASE OUR OVERALL SECURITY.

342
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,074
AND FINALLY, WE THINK THOSE IN 

343
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:16,809
CONGRESS WHO SUPPORT THE 

344
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,346
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,

345
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,146
I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE MYSELF 

346
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:21,713
AVAILABLE TO THEM.

347
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,081
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH 

348
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,449
THEM BUT WE MUST FUND THE 

349
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,417
DEPARTMENT AND GIVE IT THE TOOLS

350
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,719
AND RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO 

351
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,254
EXECUTE THE MISSION THE AMERICAN

352
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:29,822
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED US TO DO.

353
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:36,462
THANK YOU.

354
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:36,962
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 

355
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:41,066
SECRETARY.

356
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,835
SO WE HAVE MANY ELEMENTS IN THE 

357
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,337
BILL THAT WE WANTED.

358
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,607
JUST TO LOOK AT A FEW OF THEM, 

359
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,546
WE'RE PROVIDING $654.6 BILLION 

360
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,782
IN TOTAL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING 

361
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,182
FOR DEFENSE.

362
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:57,716
IT'S A RECORD.

363
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,153
ALL RECORDS FOR DEFENSE.

364
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,721
THERE WILL BE NOBODY THAT SAYS 

365
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,491
THAT OUR MILITARY IS GOING TO BE

366
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,291
DEPLETED LIKE THEY'VE BEEN 

367
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,862
SAYING OVER THE LAST LONG PERIOD

368
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:15,034
OF TIME, LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

369
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:15,734
FRANKLY, BEYOND PRESIDENT OBAMA.

370
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,504
THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING.

371
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,808
WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON

372
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:27,246
NUCLEAR -- OUR NUCLEAR SYSTEMS 

373
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,314
TO UPGRADE AND IN SOME CASES 

374
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,084
BRAND NEW, WHETHER IT'S 

375
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,585
SUBMARINES, NUCLEAR SUBMARINES 

376
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:33,986
AND OTHERS.

377
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:38,690
SO WE'LL HAVE BY FAR THE MOST 

378
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,226
POWERFUL NUCLEAR FORCE ON EARTH,

379
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,228
AND IT WILL BE ABSOLUTELY IN 

380
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:47,433
PERFECT SHAPE AND CONDITION, AND

381
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,134
HOPEFULLY, PRAISE BE TO GOD WE 

382
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:51,837
DON'T EVER HAVE TO USE IT.

383
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:52,471
BUT THERE WILL BE NOBODY THAT'S 

384
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,475
EVEN CLOSE.

385
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,178
THIS WILL GIVE A SUBSTANTIAL 

386
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:04,249
INCREASE TO PEOPLE EVEN OUTSIDE 

387
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:06,819
OF THE MILITARY BUT MILITARY 

388
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:07,720
RELATED.

389
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,488
SOME OF THE MANY THINGS THAT 

390
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,357
WE'RE BUYING IN THE MILITARY, WE

391
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:17,396
HAVE $23.8 BILLION TO PROCURE 34

392
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,030
NAVY SHIPS.

393
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,632
OUR NAVY IS AT ABOUT THE LOWEST 

394
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:25,270
POINT IN TERMS OF SHIPS THAT 

395
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,873
IT'S BEEN IN OVER 100 YEARS, AND

396
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:31,577
WE'RE ADDING A SIGNIFICANT 

397
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:36,215

00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,193
AIRCRAFT IN THE WORLD, JET 

402
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:49,595
FIGHTERS, TOTAL STEALTH.

403
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,197
THEY'RE HARD TO FIND.

404
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,265
THEY'RE HARD TO SEE.

405
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,433
THEREFORE, THEY'RE HARD TO BEAT.

406
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,867
IT'S VERY TOUGH TO BEAT A PLANE 

407
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,836
WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

408
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,138
IT'S THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE 

409
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,139

TANKER AIRCRAFT IS VERY 

414
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,956
IMPORTANT BASED ON EVERYTHING.

415
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,958
IT ALLOWS OUR PLANES TO TRAVEL 

416
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,293
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT 

417
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,695

ISRAEL AND OTHERS ON VARIOUS 

433
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,138
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

434
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,907
WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON

435
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:09,407
MISSILE DEFENSE.

436
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,610
WE HAVE A LOT OF OFFENSE THAT'S 

437
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,313
BEEN RECENTLY INSTALLED.

438
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,615
WE'RE SPENDING TREMENDOUS MONEY 

439
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,416
ON MISSILE DEFENSE.

440
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,318
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS.

441
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,119
EVERYBODY DOES.

442
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,319
WITH WHAT WE HAVE OUT THERE, 

443
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:21,920
MISSILE DEFENSE IS VERY, VERY 

444
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,726
IMPORTANT.

445
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,496
WE ARE FUNDING OUR BORDER PATROL

446
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,132
AGENTS AND OUR I.C.E. AGENTS.

447
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,634
THEY ARE WORKING LONG HOURS 

448
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,970
UNDER TREMENDOUSLY DANGEROUS 

449
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,571
CONDITIONS.

450
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:43,208
WE'RE ADDING LARGE NUMBERS OF 

451
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,412
IMMIGRATION JUDGES, HIGH QUALITY

452
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:46,645
JUDGES.

453
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,546
NOT ONLY ARE WE ADDING THEM IN 

454
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:52,317
THE DISTRICT COURT LEVEL AND THE

455
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:53,118
FEDERAL LEVEL OF COURT OF 

456
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,954
APPEALS, BUT WE'RE ADDING 

457
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,555
IMMIGRATION JUDGES AT A VERY 

458
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:01,460
HIGH LEVEL.

459
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,696
SO WHILE WE'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED

460
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:07,732
IN THE $1.3 TRILLION, NOBODY 

461
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:08,567
MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN ME 

462
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,204
BECAUSE THE NUMBER IS SO LARGE, 

463
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,240
IT WILL START COMING DOWN.

464
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,009
WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FUND OUR

465
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,045
MILITARY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE

466
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,314
BY FAR THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN

467
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:23,915
THE WORLD.

468
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:25,217
THIS WILL BE BY FAR THE 

469
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,386
STRONGEST MILITARY THAT WE'VE 

470
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:28,854
EVER HAD.

471
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,421
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE 

472
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,559
PAGES, A LOT OF THAT IS DEVOTED,

473
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,394
A LOT, TO THE MILITARY.

474
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:38,797
I JUST WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF 

475
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:43,502
CONGRESS FOR WORKING SO HARD.

476
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,602
WHILE WE CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN 

477
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:47,172
SOME WAYS, WE HAVE TO ALSO KNOW 

478
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,040
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF STRINGS 

479
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,712
PULLING EVERYBODY IN DIFFERENT 

480
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,012
DIRECTIONS.

481
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:57,616
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS, THE 

482
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,451
REPUBLICAN CONGRESS MEN AND 

483
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,652
WOMEN HAVE BEEN STEADFAST ON 

484
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,589
THEIR FIGHT FOR THE BORDER AND 

485
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,358
STEADFAST FOR THEIR FIGHT ON THE

486
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:07,859
MILITARY.

487
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:14,066
WE'RE ALSO SPENDING $6 BILLION 

488
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:18,537
ON, AS YOU KNOW, VARIOUS FORMS 

489
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,273
OF DRUG CONTROL, HELPING PEOPLE 

490
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:24,309
THAT ARE ADDICTED.

491
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,877
IT'S A TERRIBLE PROBLEM, BUT 

492
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,847
THIS WILL BE ALSO A RECORD.

493
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,616
WE'LL BE SUING CERTAIN DRUG 

494
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:32,617
COMPANIES FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE 

495
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:36,555
WITH THE OPIOIDS, AND WE'LL BE 

496
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,492
BRINGING THE SUITS AT A FEDERAL 

497
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:40,926
LEVEL.

498
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:41,960
THE LEVEL OF DRUGS THAT ARE 

499
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,963
BEING PUT OUT THERE AND THE 

500
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,198
POWER OF THIS ADDICTION IS HARD 

501
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:46,665
TO BELIEVE.

502
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,267
PEOPLE GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A 

503
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,335
PERIOD OF A WEEK AND THEY COME 

504
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,304
OUT, THEY'RE DRUG ADDICTS.

505
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,939
THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY.

506
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,707
DOCTORS ARE WAY DOWN NOW IN 

507
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,242
THEIR ORDERS OF THE OPIOIDS, WAY

508
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:57,442
DOWN.

509
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,978
THAT'S A GREAT THING.

510
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,181
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR IN OUR 

511
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,616
RESEARCH FUNDS, WE'RE LOOKING 

512
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,152
FOR A MEDICINE THAT CAN STOP THE

513
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,621
PAIN WITHOUT THE ADDICTION SO 

514
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,090
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO 

515
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,491
BECOME ADDICTED TO THESE 

516
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:14,593
INCREDIBLE DRUGS.

517
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,128
SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE HAVE.

518
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,229
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE $6 BILLION 

519
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:22,901
IN HAVING TO DO WITH OPIOIDS AND

520
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,670
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT THIS COUNTRY

521
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,337
AND IN FACT THE WORLD IS HAVING 

522
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,640
WITH DRUGS.

523
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,642
SO WE'RE EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT

524
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,911
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHEN IT 

525
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,012
COMES TO OUR MILITARY.

526
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:39,451
OUR MILITARY WILL BE FAR 

527
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,685
SUPERIOR THAN TO ANY MILITARY 

528
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:41,420
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

529
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,487
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US.

530
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,923
YOU SEE THE PLAYERS OUT THERE.

531
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,826
YOU SEE WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

532
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,795
WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT'S 

533
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,130
HAPPENED WITH OPIOIDS.

534
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,999
WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT'S 

535
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,501
HAPPENED WITH CERTAIN ELEMENTS 

536
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:57,302
OF THE BORDER.

537
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,640
NOT HAPPY WITH $1.6 BILLION BUT 

538
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,574
IT DOES START THE WALL AND WE 

539
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:06,044
WILL MAKE THAT $1.6 BILLION GO 

540
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,180
VERY, VERY FAR.

541
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,683
IT'S GOING TO GO VERY FAR.

542
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,752
I CAN TELL YOU THIS AND I SAY 

543
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,054
THIS TO DACA RECIPIENTS, THAT 

544
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,322
THE REPUBLICANS ARE WITH YOU.

545
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,091
THEY WANT TO GET YOUR SITUATION 

546
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:21,860
TAKEN CARE OF.

547
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,362
THE DEMOCRATS FOUGHT US.

548
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,696
THEY JUST FOUGHT EVERY SINGLE 

549
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,397
INCH OF THE WAY.

550
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:30,736
THEY DID NOT WANT DACA IN THIS 

551
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:30,936
BILL.

552
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,737
AND AS YOU KNOW, DACA IS ALSO 

553
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:36,041
TIED TO THE WALL FOR THE MAJOR 

554
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,176
FUNDING, THE $25 BILLION FOR THE

555
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,144
WALL AND OTHER THINGS.

556
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,913
SO I THINK THAT WILL BE COMING 

557
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,717
UP VERY SOON, BUT I DO WANT THE 

558
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,785
HISPANIC COMMUNITY TO KNOW AND 

559
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,954
DACA RECIPIENTS TO KNOW THAT 

560
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:52,457
REPUBLICANS ARE MUCH MORE ON 

561
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,592
YOUR SIDE THAN THE DEMOCRATS WHO

562
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:58,697
ARE USING YOU FOR THEIR OWN 

563
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:58,964
PURPOSES.

564
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,398
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I JUST 

565
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:03,101
WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR 

566
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:03,835
BEING HERE.

567
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,136
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF MANY OF THE 

568
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:07,839
ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 

569
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,005
GET.

570
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,441
WE'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IN 

571
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,876
ORDER TO FUND THE MILITARY WE 

572
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:15,013
HAD TO GIVE UP THINGS WHERE WE 

573
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,348
CONSIDER IN MANY CASES THEM TO 

574
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:21,886
BE BAD OR THEM TO BE A WASTE OF 

575
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,422
MONEY, BUT THAT'S THE WAY, 

576
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,022
UNFORTUNATELY, RIGHT NOW THE 

577
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,758
SYSTEM WORKS.

578
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,528
BUT WE HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY.

579
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,562
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE 

580
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:35,033
GREATEST MILITARY WE'VE EVER 

581
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,669
HAD, AND LOTS OF GOOD THINGS ARE

582
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,936
HAPPENING.

583
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,238
THE TRADE SITUATION WE'LL BE 

584
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,873
TALKING ABOUT NEXT WEEK.

585
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,708
WE HAVE MANY TRADE DEALS, NOT 

586
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,477
ONLY THE DEAL BEING MADE ON 

587
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,244
SOUTH KOREA WHICH LOOKS LIKE 

588
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,814
IT'S VERY CLOSE TO BEING 

589
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,014
FINALIZED, BUT MANY OTHER 

590
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,115
COUNTRIES ARE NOW NEGOTIATING 

591
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:53,218
FAIR TRADE DEALS WITH US.

592
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,954
SO WE'LL BE ROLLING THEM OUT AS 

593
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:56,655
YOU SEE THEM.

594
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,989
AND PART OF THE REASON, FRANKLY,

595
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:00,091
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT IS 

596
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:02,127
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE 

597
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,130
TARIFFS ON STEEL AND THE TARIFFS

598
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,132
ON ALUMINUM BECAUSE IT SHOWED 

599
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,000
HOW UNFAIR SOME OF THESE TRADE 

600
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,001
DEALS THAT HAVE BEEN IN 

601
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,437
EXISTENCE FOR MANY YEARS, HOW 

602
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,039
UNFAIR THEY'VE BEEN.

603
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,907
SO IT WILL BE GREAT FOR OUR 

604
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,945
COUNTRY, AND FRANKLY, IT WILL 

605
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,079
ALSO BE FREIGGREAT FOR OTHER 

606
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,346
COUNTRIES.

607
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,014
IT WILL BE FAIR AND IT WILL BE 

608
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:23,314
RECIPROCAL.

609
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:23,915
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

610
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,884
I APPRECIATE IT.

611
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:26,818
THANK YOU. 

612
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,621
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 

613
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:29,921
[INAUDIBLE]

614
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,789
>> WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT IN ABOUT 

615
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,325
20 MINUTES AFTER YOU LOOK AT IT.

616
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,093
WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND

617
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,027
YOU'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

618
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,929
WE LOOKED AT A VETO.

619
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,865
I LOOKED VERY SERIOUSLY AT THE 

620
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,065
VETO.

621
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,300
I WAS THINKING ABOUT DOING IT 

622
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,502
VETO BUT BECAUSE OF THE 

623
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,103
INCREDIBLE GAINS THAT WE HAVE 

624
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,073
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE FOR THE 

625
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,542
MILITARY, THAT OVERRODE ANY OF 

626
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,209
OUR THINKING.

627
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,178
>> HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT 

628
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,913
THE IMPACT OF THE TARIFF ON THE 

629
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,114
STOCK MARKET AND -- 

630
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:56,948
>> I THINK THE STOCK MARKET IS 

631
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,883
GOING TO BE GREAT.

632
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,918
THE STOCK MARKET'S WAY UP.

633
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,287
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE THE 

634
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:02,887
STOCK MARKET WAS FROM A 

635
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:03,621
DIFFERENT PLANET.

636
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:04,756
IT'S WAY UP.

637
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,957
CHINA IS GOING TO END UP 

638
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,959
TREATING US FAIRLY.

639
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,728
FOR MANY YEARS THEY HAD FREE 

640
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:09,928
REIGN.

641
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,229
THEY DON'T HAVE FREE REIGN 

642
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:11,663
ANYMORE.

643
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,231
WE'RE VERY FRIENDLY WITH CHINA.

644
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,268
WE HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH

645
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:16,835
CHINA.

646
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,335
LOOK, IT'S TIME.

647
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:17,969
IT'S TIME.

648
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,538
LAST YEAR WE LOST $500 BILLION 

649
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,907
ON TRADE WITH CHINA.

650
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,476
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

651
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,612
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

652
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,781
>>> JONATHAN KARL JOINS US 

653
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,014
AGAIN.

654
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:31,716
THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR HE WAS 

655
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:32,918
PLEASED ABOUT THE DEFENSE 

656
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,152
SPENDING, NOT HAPPY ABOUT BORDER

657
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,754
SECURITY AND HE PLACED THE BLAME

658
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,421
WITH DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS. 

659
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,757
>> Reporter: I HAVE TO SAY THAT 

660
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,525
IS THE STRANGEST BILL SIGNING IF

661
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,959
IT WAS A BILL SIGNING THAT I 

662
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,294
HAVE EVER SEEN COVERING THE 

663
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:44,729
WHITE HOUSE.

664
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:47,132
THE PRESIDENT RAILED AGAINST THE

665
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,232
BILL, SAID THERE ARE MANY THINGS

666
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,668
IN THIS BILL, THIS MASSIVE 

667
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:51,903
SPENDING BILL THAT HE DOES NOT 

668
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,272
LIKE, THAT HE IS UNHAPPY WITH, 

669
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,007
AND THEN HE ALTERNATED AND 

670
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,442
PRAISED THE BILL AND THEN WENT 

671
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,410
OFF ON TANGENTS ABOUT TRADE 

672
00:22:59,410 --> 00:22:59,644
DEALS.

673
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,446
IT WAS A VERY ODD BILL SIGNING.

674
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,582
THAT'S HOW IT WAS ADVERTISED ON 

675
00:23:04,582 --> 00:23:06,485
THE WHITE HOUSE SCHEDULE, AS A 

676
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,886
BILL SIGNING.

677
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,188
ULTIMATELY HE SAID THAT HE 

678
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:12,090
SIGNED THIS OR I GUESS HE 

679
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,658
ALREADY SIGNED IT BECAUSE OF THE

680
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,193
MONEY THAT IS IN THERE FOR THE 

681
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:15,927
MILITARY, WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

682
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,361
IS CALLING THE LARGEST INCREASE 

683
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:18,796
IN MILITARY SPENDING.

684
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:21,032
SOMETIMES THEY SAY IT'S THE 

685
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,133
LARGEST IN 15 YEARS.

686
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,635
SOMETIMES THEY SAY IT'S THE 

687
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,103
LARGEST SINCE WORLD WAR II.

688
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,205
WE'LL SEE HOW THE NUMBERS SHAKE 

689
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:27,606
OUT.

690
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,941
IT IS A BIG INCREASE IN MILITARY

691
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,208
SPENDING.

692
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,376
THE BOTTOM LINE IS FOR THE 

693
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,610
PRESIDENT AND THE NUMBER ONE 

694
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,345
REASON WHY HE'S SO UPSET ABOUT 

695
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:35,280
BEING PUT IN THE POSITION OF 

696
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,314
HAVING TO SIGN THIS BILL IS THAT

697
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:38,416
THERE IS VIRTUALLY NOTHING IN 

698
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,551
THERE FOR HIS BORDER WALL.

699
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,486
HE MENTIONED $1.6 BILLION.

700
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,223
THAT'S $1.6 BILLION FOR BORDER 

701
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,490
SECURITY, BUT BYRON, THERE'S 

702
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,994
ONLY MONEY IN THIS BILL FOR 33 

703
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:53,765
MILES OF NEW WALL, 33 MILES ON A

704
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,934
BORDER THAT IS MORE THAN 2,000 

705
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,567
MILES LONG.

706
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:57,768
IT IS FAR SHORT OF WHAT HE 

707
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:58,169
WANTED.

708
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,871
THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THE 

709
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,138
PRESIDENT.

710
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,106
THAT'S WHY HE CAME SO CLOSE TO 

711
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:04,543
DECIDING -- SO CLOSE TO, HE 

712
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,344
SAYS, CONSIDERING VETOING THIS 

713
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:06,544
BILL. 

714
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:08,179
>> JONATHAN, DURING THE 

715
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,482
CAMPAIGN, TRUMP PROMISED $25 

716
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,884
BILLION, I THINK, RIGHT, FOR 

717
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:13,552
BORDER SECURITY?

718
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,020
THIS IS FAR SHORT OF THAT. 

719
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,387
>> Reporter: $25 BILLION IS THE 

720
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,156
NUMBER THEY HAVE PUT OUT TO 

721
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:18,790
CONSTRUCT THE WALL.

722
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,625
AT TIMES THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 

723
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,027
THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DELIVER

724
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,862
IT UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF 

725
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,862
SCHEDULE, BUT NO MATTER HOW YOU 

726
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:27,365
SLICE IT, $1.6 BILLION IS FAR 

727
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:27,732
SHORT.

728
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,500
REMEMBER, AGAIN, THE $1.6 

729
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,736
BILLION HE'S GETTING IS NOT ALL 

730
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,172
FOR WALL CONSTRUCTION.

731
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,540
IT'S FOR BORDER SECURITY.

732
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,075
SOME OF THAT IS SECURITY THAT 

733
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,409
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WALL 

734
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:39,778
AT ALL.

735
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,246
SOME OF IT IS IMPROVING EXISTING

736
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,115
FENCING ON THE BORDER, AND ONLY 

737
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,451
33 MILES OF NEW WALL INCLUDED IN

738
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,353
