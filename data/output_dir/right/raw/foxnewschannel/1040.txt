MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

22
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:38,513
PIECES OF IT.

23
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:40,449
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO SPYING,

NOT ONLY IN SINGAPORE BUT IN

46
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:17,018

00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:29,865
>> YOU HAVE TO GO OVER A BRIDGE

52
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,833
OR A SUBWAY TO GET THERE WHICH

53
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,368
IS WHY THEY PICKED THAT

54
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:34,836
LOCATION, THEY CAN CLOSE IT OFF

55
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:35,470

00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,756
BEST, THEY'LL SWEEP THAT ROOM,

67
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:56,191
LOCK IT DOWN, PROTECT IT.

68
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,726
ANYBODY THAT'S LOOKING AT

HAVE CAMERAS LOOKING AT IT.

73
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,371
THE BIGGEST THING THAT THE

74
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:10,872
CHINESE WANT IS THE INFORMATION

>> CHINA IS 90% OF TRADE WITH

82
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:23,652
NORTH KOREA.

83
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,387
THEY'RE BASICALLY THE ONES THAT

84
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,154
KEEP NORTH KOREA AFLOAT.

85
00:02:26,154 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY CARE FOR MAN ANYBODY ABOUT
