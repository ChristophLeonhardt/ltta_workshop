1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:02,520
It was a revealing
juxtaposition:

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,230
a row of
all-male senators,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,500
and one woman sitting
in front of them.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,450
A female sex crimes
prosecutor

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,390
called in on
their behalf to question

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,440
another woman,
Christine Blasey Ford,

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,250
about sexual assault
allegations against

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,920
Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,510
It was compounded by the
fact that a few days earlier

10
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,490
the prosecutor,
Rachel Mitchell,

11
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,820
had been referred to as —

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,360
“A female assistant —”

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,040
The scene shed light
on a simple fact:

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,200
There has never been
a Republican woman

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,910
on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

16
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,190
It also foreshadowed
other awkward interactions

17
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,740
between male G.O.P. leaders
and women who say

18
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,160
they were sexually assaulted.

19
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,480
“You have power, when so
many women are powerless.”

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,470
This was
Senator Jeff Flake.

21
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,610
And this was
Senator Orrin Hatch.

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,960
The president and
Senator Chuck Grassley

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,850
both floated the
conspiracy theory

24
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,150
that the protesters
were backed

25
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,000
by liberal fundraiser
George Soros.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,780
“Do you believe George Soros
is behind all of this?”

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,930
“I tend to
believe it.”

28
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,639
For Republicans,
this all points to

29
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:04,019
a problem that’s
bigger than optics.

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,390
The gender gap in
G.O.P. leadership extends

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,730
beyond the committee.

32
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,400
Of 51 Republican senators,
six are women.

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,120
Democrats have 17.

34
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,920
In the House, there are
23 Republican women —

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,780
and 61 Democratic ones —

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,760
out of
435 members.

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,010
The one overarching factor
is President Trump himself,

38
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,400
who has said
it’s a tough time —

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,810
not for women, but for
men, who he thinks

40
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,790
are often victims
of false allegations.

41
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,680
“Well, I say that it’s
a very scary time

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,150
for young men in America.”

43
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,780
The president even
went so far as

44
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,110
to mock Dr. Blasey’s
testimony at a rally.

45
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,140
“Where is the place?

46
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,015
I don’t remember.

47
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,220
How many years ago was it?

48
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,030
I don’t know. I don’t know.
I don’t know.”

49
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,120
Many women stand
by the president.

50
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,040
But in an election year,
with record numbers

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,770
of women running
for office,

52
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,830
only about one-quarter
are Republicans.

53
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,280
“I’ll actually support
President Trump.”

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,370
Those small numbers
mean the G.O.P. gender gap

55
00:02:00,370 --> 00:00:00,000
is unlikely to shrink
any time soon.
