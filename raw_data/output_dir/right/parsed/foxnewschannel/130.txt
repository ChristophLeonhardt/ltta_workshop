MISTAKE.
STEVE: MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS BLASTING THE SECOND
CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS HEADING
TOWARD OUR BORDER AND SAYS
IT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR
REPUBLICANS HEADING INTO THE
MIDTERMS.
AINSLEY: THE PRESIDENT
TWEETING, QUOTE:  HARD TO
BELIEVE WITH THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE FROM SOUTH OF THE
BORDER WALKING UNIMPEDED
TOWARD OUR COUNTRY IN A FORM
OF LARGE CARAVANS THAT THE
DEMOCRATS WON'T APPROVE
LEGISLATION THAT WILL ALLOW
LAWS FOR PROTECTION OF OUR
COUNTRY.
GREAT MIDTERM ISSUE FOR
REPUBLICANS.
BRIAN: LET'S BRING IN TOM
HOMAN FORMER ICE DIRECTOR
AND FEELS FOR THE BORDER
PATROL AS WE DO BEING
OVERWHELMED AT THE MOMENT.
FIRST OFF, ON THIS CARAVAN,
TOM, WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR
THE CARAVAN.
THERE WAS ALREADY A SURGE AT
THE BORDER.
>> YEAH.
THE NUMBERS ARE UP ON FAMILY
UNITS.
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS
100 PERCENT ACCURATE ON
THIS.
AS ICE DIRECTOR I WENT TO
HILL MANY TIMES TO TALK TO
LAWMAKERS ABOUT CLOSING
THOSE LOOPHOLES.
TWO BIGGEST LOOPHOLES IS
ASYLUM, THRESHOLD SO LOW YOU
JUST GOT TO SAY A COUPLE
MAGIC WORDS THAT THE
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TEACH
TO YOU SAY TO GET INTO THE
UNITED STATES AND GET
RELEASED FROM CUSTODY OF
BECAUSE OF THE SECOND ISSUE
AND LOOPHOLE AGREEMENT WE
CAN'T DETAIN FAMILIES MORE
THAN 20 DAYS NOT QUICK
ENOUGH TO SEE A JUDGE NO.
CONSEQUENCES, NO DETERRENCE.
GET IN AND GET RELEASED
NEVER SHOW UP IN COURT WHY
WOULDN'T THEY STOP COMING?
AINSLEY: BRING MORE JUDGES
DOWN THERE OR HIRE MORE.
>> HIRING A LOT OF JUDGES.
THIS ISSUE, THIS CARAVAN
ISSUE LAYS AT THE FEET OF
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY UP ON
THE HILL.
LIKE I SAID, THEY HAVE BEEN
EDUCATED WHAT THESE
LOOPHOLES ARE.
THEY DON'T WANT TO CLOSE THE
LOOPHOLES.
THEY WANT THE PRESIDENT TO
HAVE A FAIL ON THEIR.
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE PAYING ATTENTION.
THIS ISN'T THE PRESIDENT'S
FAILURE.
THIS ISN'T THE SECRETARY'S
FAILURE.
THIS IS THE DEMOCRATS'
FAILURE.
THEY KNOW THE ISSUE AND THEY
REFUSE TO FIX IT.
THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR
POLITICAL AMBITIONS AHEAD OF
PUBLIC SAFETY, NATIONAL
SECURITY, AND BORDER
CONTROL.
SIMPLE AS THAT.
STEVE: YOU KNOW, TOM, BACK
IN APRIL THERE WAS THE OTHER
CARAVAN THAT GOT SO MUCH
NOTICE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
THREATENED THOSE NATIONS,
THE HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA
AND MEXICO AND SAID IF YOU
DON'T HELP US ENFORCE YOUR
OWN BORDER AND THEY WIND UP
HERE, WE ARE GOING TO CUT
OFF THE AID.
HE NEVER REALLY FOLLOWED
THROUGH ON THAT.
AND NOW THOSE PEOPLE, SOME
OF THE PEOPLE WOUND UP
EVENTUALLY GETTING TO THE
BORDER AND SEEKING ASYLUM.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO THEM.
WE ARE AT THE SAME PLACE
RIGHT NOW.
WE ARE DEPENDING ON MEXICO
TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THEIR
SOUTHERN BORDER AND THEY SAY
OKAY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET
ANYBODY ACROSS WITHOUT A
PASSPORT.
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE
PASSPORTS.
>> RIGHT.
THE LAW IS CLEAR THAT IN
MEXICO PEOPLE IN CENTRAL
AMERICA CANNOT TRANSIT
THROUGH MEXICO WITHOUT WHAT
WE CALL TRANSIT VISA.
THEY CAN STOP THEM AT THE
SOUTHERN BORDER AND TURN
AROUND OR LET THEM APPLY FOR
ASYLUM IN MEXICO.
IF THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY
ESCAPING FEAR AND
PERSECUTION IN HONDURAS
WHERE THEY ALREADY WENT
THROUGH GUATEMALA.
THEY ARE GETTING TO MEXICO.
THEY DON'T NEED TO GET TO
THE UNITED STATES.
THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT
ESCAPING FEAR AND
PERSECUTION.
THIS IS ABOUT GETTING TO THE
UNITED STATES AND TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE LOOPHOLES
IN THE SYSTEM.
LET ME ADD ONE MORE THING.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS
ON THE FAMILIES THAT ARE
CLAIMING FEAR AND
PERSECUTION, 8 OUT OF THE 10
LOSE THEIR CASES WHEN THEY
FINALLY GET TO IMMIGRATION
COURT.
THIS IS FRAUD.
THIS IS JUST FRIVOLOUS
FRAUD.
BRIAN: THE WORD IS OUT THAT
CATCH AND RELEASE IS STILL
THERE DESPITE THE
PRESIDENT'S PUSH.
GETTING ANKLE BRACELETS AND
GETTING LET OUT INTO THE
COUNTRY.
THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES,
WHICH WAS POORLY EXECUTED
AND INTRODUCED WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ABOUT.
A DETERRENT.
WASN'T TO BREAK UP FAMILIES.
LET THEM KNOW THAT'S NOT THE
WAY TO GET HERE.
MEXICO IS RESPONSE WE ARE
SEEING DISPATCHED TWO 727
PLANES FILLED WITH FEDERAL
OFFICERS TO THEIR BORDERS.
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS
ADMINISTRATION, THE NEW ONE,
IS DETERMINED TO KEEP
RELATIONS WITH US STRONG BY
SHOWING STRENGTH AT THEIR
BORDER, WHEN THEY BUSTED
GUATEMALA'S BORDER?
>> LOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
A WARRIOR WHEN IT COMES TO
BORDER SECURITY AND
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.
WE COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER
PRESIDENT THAN WE HAVE RIGHT
NOW.
THIS MAN HAS THE BACKS OF
THE BORDER PATROL AND ICE.
THIS MAN BELIEVES IN BORDER
SECURITY.
THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY,
REGARDLESS OF REPUBLICAN,
DEMOCRAT, THERE IS NO
DOWNSIDE IN SECURING THE
BORDER.
BRIAN: I SHOULD BE CLEAR,
TOM, I WANT TO KNOW IF
MEXICO IS GOING TO REINFORCE
THEIR BORDER SO THEY DON'T
GET TO OUR BORDER?
I THINK MEXICO WILL HELP.
I REALLY DO.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE
CATCH AND RELEASE, BRIAN,
THIS IS ANOTHER FAILURE OF
CONGRESS THAT NO ONE IS
TALKING ABOUT.
ICE JUSTIFIED THE NEED FOR
FUNDING FOR 51,000 BEDS.
CONGRESS WANTS TO GIVE THEM
40,000.
PEOPLE ARE BEING RELEASED
BECAUSE ICE HASN'T BEEN
PROPERLY FUNDED EITHER.
ANOTHER FAILURE.
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE FAMILIES
SEPARATED BUT WHEN THEY
SEPARATED THOSE PEOPLE CROSS
INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY
NUMBERS WENT DOWN 22% IN TWO
WEEKS.
IF THEY WOULD HAVE STUCK
WITH THAT FOR 30, 60 DAYS
THERE WOULDN'T BE A CARAVAN
TODAY.
STEVE: NEWT GINGRICH SAID
