1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,440
If you ever saw a wooden surfboard it was probably hanging in somebody's house or underneath a deck

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,480
But kind of in the last 10 or 15 years wood has made a big comeback

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,160
They surf wonderfully

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,840
It's beautiful and it feels great to be on one of them

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,480
I always had a love for wood and kind of passionate about things that went in the water

6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,240
I've kind of been around wooden boats most of my life

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,300
There's just so much character

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,900
The way their built, the stories that come with them

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,360
A lot of that has translated over to why we build surfboards the way we do

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
When we first started thinking about building surfboards, wood was the natural material we chose

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
They have a very high strength to weight ratio

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,000
Wooden surfboards have the longest history of use in the surf world than any other material

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,280
People have been surfing wooden surfboards since kinda the first

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,960
documented history of people riding waves

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,740
Board starts in CAD, where we take a 3d model

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,440
break down the shape and kind of create frames and templates and

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,560
all the inner parts of the board that we get cut

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,740
on a CNC machine

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
We take those frames and we just pop them out

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,200
assemble the frame into a kind of skeleton

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,800
We go out to our lumber shed, pick a bunch of cedar, bring em into our mill shop

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,020
put glue along the edges, clamp it all together into a panel

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Everything's book matched, you have symmetry in the colors and texture of the wood

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,460
Cut your outline

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
Take our assembled frame

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,140
gently put it down right on top of the plank

27
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,260
Once that foundation is started, you're basically building up the three dimensional shape

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,800
the outside part of the board using lots of strips that kind of interlock and fit together

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,720
Every piece of wood is going to be different and it's all gonna react differently

30
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,240
There are frustrations with it, but I think that's one of the things that keeps it challenging

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,520
you learn to read the, kind of what the grain lines are doing and what the color of the wood is telling you

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,020
Once those rails are cleaned up, we put our top planks on

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,820
It's a little bit like putting a lid on a box.

34
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,500
It's like this is it, whatever's inside that board is staying inside that board

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,880
and by tensioning some rope you can clamp the two together

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,100
It's like a time capsule

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,160
What makes our boards unique are they are built right here in york

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,480
they're built using material that grows right here in the state of maine

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,400
they're built 100% by hand, by local crafts people and surfers

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
There is a lot of time that goes into these boards

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
between forty and sixty hours, start to finish

42
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,540
We wanted to build surfboards that were as hollow as they could be, but still be strong enough to work well

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,180
Too light and they don't surf well but too heavy and they don't surf well

44
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,360
so there's a, there's a balance pint there and that's where we try to be

45
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,680
Taking the board off the rocker table, once the top has gone on.

46
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
that is by far one of my top favorite parts

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,800
It's just you, and a shaping stand

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,300
a board and a hand plane

49
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,560
Everything else is out of your view

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,360
it's simple

51
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,440
it's pleasurable

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,460
it's quiet

53
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,420
you can be with your thoughts and you can kind of just be present

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,760
There's something about taking a nice sharp edge tool to a beautiful piece of wood and feeling the curls coming off

55
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,200
and knowing that every pass that you're making. you're kind of getting it closer and closer to what you have in mind

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,800
Once we've shaped it down and the boards looking like it's supposed to look like, time for it to go into the glassing room

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,080
4 ounce fiberglass, laying it over the board, draping it over the edges, cutting it, applying epoxy on the board

58
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,100
Once both sides are Lamb coated, it's time to put in the hardware

59
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,920
drill and router and install the fin box

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,200
and on the other side we drill and put in the leash plug and a vent

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,480
There's a lot of air just naturally inside the board

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,020
And that air wants to expand and contract with temperature changes

63
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,660
and that vent has a little piece of gortex fabric in it, and it allows air to kinda breathe both ways

64
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,300
but it doesn't allow water in it

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,060
Once all that hardware's put in, goes back into the glassing room,

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,080
we brush a nice beautiful thick coat of epoxy over the whole surface

67
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
and that we call a gloss coat

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,320
that's supposed to look beautiful and glossy and shiney and flawless

69
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,100
you get to see that board come to life

70
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,680
whatever the colors in the wood they really come out

71
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,460
it just makes it look like candy

72
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,500
you jus wanna touch it and run your hands down it and it's just kinda the icing on the cake

73
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,560
once everything's hard, we put it into what we call the oven

74
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,580
Get that epoxy to cure, really kind of bake it, and just get it to harden

75
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,800
put in the fin, screw in the vent, ship it out

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,720
we just love the idea of building something that's sustainable and long lasting and made by hand

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,980
kinda give you a deeper connection to the product over something you might buy on a shelf

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
When a customer gets the board

79
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,740
they feel it. They 100% feel the amount of work and the amount of passion that went into the board

80
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,820
So, I'm not really looking at hours and efficiency

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm looking at like doing it right and enjoying it as we go
