1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:03,703
SO JIM ASKED ME TO DO THIS. 

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,807
HE DID SWITCH FROM DEMOCRAT TO 

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,106
REPUBLICAN. 

4
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:10,076
YOU DON'T SEE THAT OFTEN. 

5
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,947
IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY, NO, 

6
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:14,914
I'M NOT COMING. 

7
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,916
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. 

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,184
I WATCHED THESE TOURNAMENTS. 

9
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,255
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR THESE 

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,691
TALENTED ATHLETES. 

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,693
WE ARE GATHERED HERE ON THE EVE 

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,328

13
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,263
CELEBRATE THE COURAGEOUS MEN 

14
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,964
AND WOMEN WHO MAKE FREEDOM 

15
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:33,933
POSSIBLE. OUR BRAVE 

16
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,936
SERVICEMEMBERS AND OUR 

17
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,470
WONDERFUL VETERANS. 

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,842
AND WE LOVE OUR VETERANS. 

19
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:48,915
FOR 242 YEARS, THAT IS A LONG 

20
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,115
TIME, AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE HAS 

21
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:52,085
ENDURED BECAUSE OF THE SWEAT, 

22
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,753
BLOOD, AND SACRIFICE OF THE 

23
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:57,590
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. 

24
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,892
WE MAY ADD A LITTLE THING 

25
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,295
CALLED SPACE FORCE. 

26
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,263
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE WANTS TO 

27
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,699
HEAR THAT. 

28
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:07,901
BUT WE ARE THINKING SERIOUSLY 

29
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,735
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SPACE IS 

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:14,707
BECOMING IMPORTANT MILITARILY. 

31
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,909
IT IS THE GREATEST FORCE FOR 

32
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,910
PEACE AND JUSTICE IN THE 

33
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,911
HISTORY OF THE WORLD. 

34
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,079
DURING BOTH THE CIVIL WAR AND 

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,449
WORLD WAR II, THE GREENBRIER'S 

36
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:23,582
 

37
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:24,083
SOLDIERS. 

38
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:28,087
IT IS APPROPRIATE. 

39
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:28,921

JOHN?

00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,456
I PLAYED WITH JOHN IN A

00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:42,962
COUNTRY. 

189
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,298
WE RESPECT ICE. 

190
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,335
THESE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE. AND YOU 

191
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,803
HAVE TO BE TOUGH. 

192
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,104
AND WHEN THEY HAVE A PROBLEM 

193
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,607
WITH MS-13 GANGS AND ALL OF 

194
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,477
THESE OTHERS THAT CAME IN 

195
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,078
THROUGH THESE HORRIBLE AND WEAK 

196
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,814
IMMIGRATION LAWS, THAT SHELLEY 

197
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,982
WAS STRENGTHENING UP, WE NEED 

198
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,482
TO GET THEM DONE. 

199
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,652
WE NEED TOUGH LAWS AND WE NEED 

200
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,387
FAIR LAWS. 

201
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,457
BUT WHEN THESE PEOPLE COME INTO 

202
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,925
OUR COUNTRY AND COME IN 

203
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,495
ILLEGALLY AND THEN THEY ARE 

204
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,663
DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE 

205
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,299
COUNTRY AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN 

206
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,135
YOU SEE NESTS OF MS-13, YOU 

207
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,136
KNOW, IT IS LIKE YOUR 

208
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:24,570
LIBERATING TOWNS. 

209
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,108
WE SEND ICE IN, AND FOR ICE IT 

210
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:33,145
IS JUST ANOTHER DAY LIKE BILL, 

211
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:33,712
JOHN, AND BUBBA. 

212
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,081
LIKE THE WAY THEY PLAY GOLF. 

213
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,649
THEY GO AND THEY PLAY. 

214
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,917
THEY DON'T KNOW. 

215
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,852
IT IS HARD. 

216
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:45,891
THESE GUYS, THEY TAKE THEM OUT 

217
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,592
OF THERE SO FAST. 

218
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,793
THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF 

219
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,059
ANYTHING. 

220
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,395
IT IS LIKE YOUR LIBERATING A 

221
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:49,595
TOWN. 

222
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,932
LIKE IN A WAR YOU LIBERATE A 

223
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:53,699
TOWN OR AREA. 

224
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,567
AND ICE GOES IN THERE AND 

225
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,170
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO GO IN 

226
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,573
SWINGING. THEY DON'T MIND. 

227
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,908
THEY ARE TOUGH. 

228
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:04,409
AND THEN I HEAR THE DEMOCRATS 

229
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:08,381
SAY WE WANT TO ABANDON ICE. WE 

230
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,083
ARE NOT ABANDONING ICE AND WE 

231
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,551
ARE NOT ABANDONING OUR LAW 

232
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,085
ENFORCEMENT. 

233
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:22,595
JUST THE OPPOSITE. 

234
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,064
SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A 

235
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,333
LEGENDARY HERO FROM WEST 

236
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,401
VIRGINIA. 

237
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,103
HE FOUGHT IN IWO JIMA. 

238
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,806
IN FEBRUARY 1945 HE VOLUNTEERED 

239
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,077
TO DASH STRAIGHT INTO ANY FIRE 

240
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,745
TO DESTROY THE ENEMY AND CLEAR 

241
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,648
PATH FOR AMERICAN FORCES TO 

242
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,183
CONTINUE FORWARD. 

243
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,484
HE WENT RIGHT INTO THE MACHINE 

244
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:45,985
GUN NESTS. 

245
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,655
JOHN DALY WOULD NOT DO THAT, 

246
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:57,096
AND -- JOHN, WOULD YOU DO THAT? 

247
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,297
IN THE FACE OF BULLETS AND 

248
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,599
BAYONETS HE RISKED HIS LIFE FOR 

249
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,100
HIS BROTHERS IN ARMS AND HE 

250
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,468
EARNED THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL 

251
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:10,276
OF HONOR. 

252
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,644
TODAY WOODY WILLIAMS IS 94 

253
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,779
YEARS OLD AND HE HAS DEDICATED 

254
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,916
HIS LIFE TO SUPPORTING GOLDSTAR 

255
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,250
FAMILIES AND BUILDING MEMORIALS 

256
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,854
TO HONOR FALLEN SERVICEMEMBERS. 

257
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,091
IN 2016 THOUSANDS WERE MOVED BY 

258
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,592
HIS PATRIOTIC WORDS WHEN HE 

259
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,996
SPOKE AT ONE OF OUR RALLIES IN 

260
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,663
WEST VIRGINIA. 

261
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,699
HE WAS INCREDIBLE. 

262
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,600
I STILL REMEMBER IT. 

263
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,468
WE REMEMBER THAT WONDERFUL 

264
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,903
MOMENT WHEN HE FLIPPED THE COIN 

265
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,839
AT THIS YEAR'S SUPER BOWL. 

266
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,375
WOODY, YOU ARE A NATIONAL 

267
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:42,641
TREASURE. 

268
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:45,378
AND WE THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM

269
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,681
OF OUR HEARTS. 

270
00:10:48,681 --> 00:11:00,659
WOODY, THANK YOU. 

271
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,895
THANK YOU, WOODY. 

272
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:11,103
A BRAVE MAN. 

273
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,304
I GIVE A LOT OF CONGRESSIONAL 

274
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:12,972
MEDALS OF HONOR. 

275
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:18,310
WHEN I SAY A LOT, IT IS ONE OF 

276
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,915
MY GREATEST HONORS TO DO THAT. 

277
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:23,849
WOODY, FANTASTIC. 

278
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,086
SO OFTEN I'M GIVING THEM WHERE 

279
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:32,191
THEY ARE JUST NOT AROUND AND WE 

280
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,092
HEAR THE STORIES AND THEIR 

281
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,193
FAMILIES ARE THERE AND EVERYONE 

282
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:34,493
IS PROUD. 

283
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,096
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE 

284
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,297
HAVE ONE THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO 

285
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,832
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING LIKE 

286
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,901
YOU, WOODY. 

287
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,035
WHERE ALSO DEEPLY MOVED AND 

288
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,737
HONORED TO BE JOINED BY A 

289
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,807
GOLDSTAR SPOUSE WHO NOTES THE 

290
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,443
CHOOSE PRICE OF FREEDOM. 

291
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:53,746
CHRISTINE'S HUSBAND WAS A 

292
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,215
SERGEANT IN THE 82nd AIRBORNE 

293
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,685
DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 

294
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,721
CHRIS WAS KILLED IN ACTION IN 

295
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,055
IRAQ IN 2005. 

296
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,792
CHRISTINE, TONIGHT WE SEND THE 

297
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,260
LOVE AND GRATITUDE OF OUR 

298
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,831
ENTIRE NATION. YOUR HUSBAND WAS 

299
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,698
SPECIAL MAN. 

300
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,202
WE WILL HOLD YOU AND YOUR 

301
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,136
PRECIOUS FAMILY IN OUR HEARTS 

302
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:17,403
FOREVER. 

303
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,238
CHRISTINE, WHERE ARE YOU? 

304
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:19,972
CHRISTINE? 

305
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:27,079
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

306
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:37,690
THANK YOU, CHRISTINE. 

307
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,395
AND, CHRISTINE, THROUGH YOUR 

308
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,095
HUSBAND'S HEROIC SACRIFICE, HE 

309
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,130
HAS ACHIEVED IMMORTALITY. 

310
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,701
AND OUR DEBT IS ETERNAL AND 

311
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,034
EVERLASTING. 

312
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,204
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

313
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,505
FROM BUNKER HILL TO THE BEACHES 

314
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:55,106
OF NORMANDY AND THE JUNGLES OF 

315
00:12:55,106 --> 00:13:03,482
VIETNAM, AMERICA AND AMERICANS 

316
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,316
IN EVERY GENERATION HAVE GIVEN 

317
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,284
THEIR LAST BREATH AND FINAL 

318
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,485
MOMENTS ON THIS EARTH IN 

319
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,919
DEFENSE OF THEIR COUNTRY AND 

320
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,288
COUNTRYMEN. 

321
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:09,922
OUR SERVICEMEMBERS HAVE 

322
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:16,996
FULFILLED THEIR DUTY TO AMERICA.

323
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,664
NOW, WE MUST FULFILL OUR SACRED 

324
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,400
DUTY TO THEM AND WE MUST 

325
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,870
PROTECT THOSE WHO PROTECT US. 

326
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,138
WHEN OUR SERVICEMEMBERS ARE IN 

327
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,707
UNIFORM, IT IS OUR OBLIGATION 

328
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,909
TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE 

329
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,176
FINEST EQUIPMENT, THE FINEST 

330
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:37,082
TRAINING, CARE, RESOURCES, AND 

331
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,516
BETTER THAN ANY MILITARY ON 

332
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:39,318
EARTH. 

333
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:44,290
AND WHEN THEY RETURN TO 

334
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,491
CIVILIAN LIFE, WE MUST ENSURE 

335
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,492
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE 

336
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,293
BEST CARE, TREATMENT, AND 

337
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:52,798
SUPPORT IN THE WORLD. 

338
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:53,498
WE ARE RESTORING AMERICAN 

339
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:54,300
SECURITY BY REBUILDING OUR 

340
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,700
GREAT MILITARY. 

341
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,204
WE HAVE SECURED THIS YEAR, WITH 

342
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,707
THE HELP OF SHELLEY AND YOUR 

343
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,910
GREAT CONGRESSMAN, A RECORD 

344
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:11,517
$700 BILLION FOR OUR MILITARY, 

345
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,718
AND NEXT YEAR $716 BILLION, THE 

346
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,485
MOST AMOUNT EVER. 

347
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:17,222
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. 

348
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:20,392
AND WHEN HAVE WE NEEDED IT MORE?

349
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:20,693
WHEN? 

350
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,727
THINK ABOUT IT. 

351
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,663
WE ARE BUILDING IT SO BIG, SO 

352
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:29,101
POWERFUL, SO STRONG, AND 

353
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,135
HOPEFULLY, WE WILL NEVER HAVE 

354
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,304
TO USE IT. 

355
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,505
AND AS THE GOLFERS CAN TELL 

356
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,707
YOU, THE STRONGER WE GET, THE 

357
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,508
LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT WE HAVE 

358
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,611
TO USE IT. 

359
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,813
WE WILL BE AT A POINT THE LIKES 

360
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,848
OF WHICH WE HAVE NEVER BEEN AS 

361
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:48,721
A POWER, AND AGAIN, HOPEFULLY 

362
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,255
NEVER HAVING TO USE THAT 

363
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:54,560
INCREDIBLE EQUIPMENT, THE BEST 

364
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,898
IN THE WORLD IN THE USA. WE 

365
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,201
ALSO GAVE OUR GREAT WARRIORS 

366
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,135
THEIR LARGEST PAY RAISE IN 

367
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:03,736
EIGHT YEARS. 

368
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:16,048
SO THEY GOT A PAY RAISE

369
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:23,422
I SIGNED INTO LAW JUST RECENTLY 

370
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:29,061

MAJOR, THE PRESIDENT'S 

955
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:26,871
FRUSTRATION WITH NATO SPENDING 

956
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,539
IS NOT NEW, BUT WHAT'S 

957
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:28,906
DIFFERENT NOW? 

958
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:33,377
>> Reporter:  THAT IT IS MORE 

959
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:34,879

SCHEDULED MEETING WITH RUSSIAN

PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 

963
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,185
EUROPEANS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY 

964
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,154
ARE NERVOUS ABOUT TWO TREND 

965
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,323
LINES OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. 

966
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:49,494
ONE, THIS MOVEMENT THAT SEEMS 

967
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,596
INEXORABLE TOWARDS A TRADE WAR. 

968
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,197
LINGERING TRADE DISPUTES ARE 

969
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,799
NOW BECOMING MANIFEST IN 

970
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,800
TARIFFS AND COUNTER TARIFFS. 

971
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,802
THAT'S ONE DISPUTE AND THIS 

972
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,071
LONG RUNNING DISPUTE OVER NATO 

973
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,574
MEMBER NATIONS FAILING TO MEET 

974
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,110
THEIR PLEDGED 2% OF GDP 

975
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,110
EXPENDITURE ON DEFENSE. 

976
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,513
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS CORRECT 

977
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,414
WHEN HE SAYS MANY NATIONS ARE 

978
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:11,449
LAGGING AND THEY'VE PROMISED 

979
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,951
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS TO LIVE UP 

980
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:14,217
TO THIS. 

981
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:18,688
NONE OF THAT IS FACTUALLY 

982
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:18,989
INCORRECT. 

983
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:21,192
EUROPEAN LEADERS AND THEIR 

984
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,360
PARLIAMENTS OR POLITICAL 

985
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,061
ENTITIES OFTEN COUNTER YES, 

986
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,829
WE'VE MADE THAT PLEDGE, BUT WE 

987
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,063
HAVE OTHER POLITICAL REALITIES 

988
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,632
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU 

989
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,434
HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, 

990
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:30,833
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

991
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,804
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS LOOK, I'VE 

992
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,139
EXPENDED MY OWN POLITICAL 

993
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,741
CAPITAL TO GET DEFENSE SPENDING 

994
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,308
IN THE UNITED STATES. 

995
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,177
YOU NEED TO DO THE SAME. 

996
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,679
SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT NATO 

997
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,313
GRIEVANCES, LONG EXPRESSED BY 

998
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,782
DONALD TRUMP AS A CANDIDATE AND 

999
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,018
AS PRESIDENT, IS THEY'RE NOW 

1000
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:47,551
RIGHT ALONGSIDE HIS TRADE 

1001
00:34:47,551 --> 00:00:00,000
DISPUTES AND WHAT LOOKS TO BE
