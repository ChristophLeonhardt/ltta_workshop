new figures from the office for national statistics show that the UK population has just hit 66 million and it's mostly a result of immigration yes just a quick report today on the office for national statistics new figures which showed that the UK population hit 66 million last year highest ever and when you consider really how small a place the UK is it's it's there's a huge huge amount of people and the Daily Mail have reported on the story saying UK population hits 66 million last year after immigration helped drive a 390 mm rise in numbers but growth has slowed down since EU referendum UK population rose by 390 2002 hit 66 million last year official figures show some 59 percent of rise was due to immigration and 41% natural factors growth rates slowed down after the EU referendum and was lowest since 2004 so to be fair it's interesting to see that actually the population growth is down since the EU referendum they say that nought point 6 percent increase in population is the lowest in 14 years but it's not necessarily reassuring I mean the figures probably mean that fewer people have come to the UK because of the referendum because of the uncertainty around breaks it and things like that but not 0.6 percent increase is still an increase and what's even more interesting is just 41 percent of the increase was the natural birth rate exceeding death rate thing according to the UN ons but 59 percent of this increase came from immigration that is unsustainable for many reasons one reason being England in particular in the UK is completely over crowded migration watch says over 90 percent of international migrants to the UK go to England which now has a population density of 425 people per square kilometre the population density of England is higher than in India the world's second most populous country and is nearly twice that of Germany and 3.5 times that of France so England bears the brunt of immigration into the UK I mean what can I say it's a great country people want to come here but we're bearing the brunt of it and we're one of the most dense countries in the world you know our population density is more than India India it's insanity and you'll notice that if you go to London seriously they try getting on the tube at rush hour my god it makes you realize how overcrowded that city is but if you read the comments by Neil Park from the ons we know that this slowdown in population increase isn't actually something to start celebrating he says this is the lowest annual population growth since 2004 due to a fall in net migration fewer births and more deaths than previously seen the effect is most pronounced in London and other areas that have seen high levels of immigration in recent years nevertheless the population is still growing faster than at any time since the post-war baby boom and the expansion of the EU in 2004 and there you have it it's still something to worry about the population is still increasing the story here isn't that it's slowed down it's that migration remains in the hundreds of thousands into the UK every year it's England that's taking the brunt of that and the population is still growing faster than at any time since the baby boom frankly we should be worried if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
