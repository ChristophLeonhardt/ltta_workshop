an earlier draft of the GOP tax bill led susan collins senator Republican senator to vote against it and so there was hope from some places not from Janke but from some people that she would continue to oppose the bill until she got assurances that it would not destabilize insurance markets and lead to higher insurance premiums that's what she had said at one point of course she did vote for the bill and it did pass in no small part thanks to her voting for it and so as a result of that the media has criticized her quite a bit turns out she does not like that criticism so we're gonna break it down on today's show she said I cannot believe that the press would have treated another senator with twenty years of experiences they have treated me after they focused on her role in its passage they've ignored everything that I've gotten and written story after story about how I'm duped how am I do when all your amendments get accepted and what's interesting about that is that she apparently agreed to support the bill after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and president Donald Trump promised to back two bills aimed at lowering health insurance premiums well that's good so if they promise to do those bills then she didn't get duped she got what she wanted and she voted for it unfortunately today happened and she acknowledged on Wednesday that McConnell and vice president Pence won't be able to keep their promise to enact the insurance stabilization legislation in exchange for voting for tax reform she still thinks the insurance stabilization bill will pass just not as quickly as she hoped which that would be bad since that was her today after the vote that would be bad but it's worse because hours before the Senate prepared to vote yesterday on a massive overhaul of American tax system a host of House Republicans told reporters that the promises made this secure the vote of senator Susan Collins have no chance of passing a lower chamber and becoming law and that is not the morning after it passed that's the date that's the day before she actually voted on it so she knew because it had been reported that her promises were not going to be kept and she voted for it anyway or another way to put that is that she was duped yeah we're lied yeah senator causing a good news and bad news you good news is I don't believe you were duped so congratulations the bad news is I think you're a liar and I think you're corrupt and I think you take legalized bribes and I think that you know that and and you knew you were gonna vote for those tax cuts and because your donors told you to and that's the whole point that you're in office your voters didn't put you there your donors put you there they give you more money than all your opponent's you've always had more money you always bought TV ads to trick people into believing you're moderate because Maine is fairly moderate state you're not a moderate you will do exactly what you're the rich donors tell you to do so you knew it before the vote that you were never gonna get those other pieces of legislation passed you knew that in fact there's some chance that you and McConnell had a meeting internally where you said okay what should we pretend publicly you got in return cuz you and I both know it ain't gonna pass the house even if it was gonna pass the Senate and you know what ain't even gonna pass the Senate so we're we're gonna what prop up the some parts of the Affordable Care Act Obamacare that they're really gonna do that the Republicans in the Senate that have the majority are gonna do that and the monsters in the house and they laughed at her they lied they said ha we're not gonna do that would never want to support a shot a single letter in Obamacare so when she came out and said oh no I got assurances from Mitch McConnell I don't Trump declared it dead today in a speech she said I wish I wasn't gonna bring this up I don't want the I don't the media focus on it but I just killed Obamacare yeah he's gonna prop it up he's gonna stabilize it for Susan Collins yeah so when you said publicly that you had gotten those assurances either you and Mitch got together and said how shall we actively lie to the American people on my voters well I pretend to be a moderate how can you help me to perpetuate that lie or you told pretty little lies to yourself and thought no maybe we'll do it later but meanwhile donors what would you like oh you'd like trillions of dollars in tax cuts no problem I can do that so Susan Collins you're a corrupt liar so and don't come now and then she says oh my god I just found out they're sexism I'm a Republican I never talk about sexism but if you dare criticize me all of a sudden I'm gonna realize that I'm a woman and then I'm gonna say Oh criticism of me well that's sexist why I would never write no we criticize your Republican colleagues in the same exact way they're all so goddamn liars they're all so corrupt they also voted for this because of their donors there's no distinction at all so don't come in here with your BS concern about sexism your newly-found concern about sexism no and then it's talking about like oh my god they talked about me this way but they wouldn't talk about Republican senators that way are you kidding me look I don't know about the rest of the polls had Cruz a liar and he's something like a man yes and Scioscia and there's some reference to crying or whatever look it's an ironic thing to do to say I can't believe they would accuse me of crying as you're crying about sexism that is made up in your case and and and how dare anyone ever criticize you right so you're not its proverbial crying not literal crying okay but you do it Paul Ryan does it Ted Cruz does it no you don't get special privileges because you happen to be a female Republican I mean I would have to say though since we care a lot about the struggle for actual equal rights between men and women we welcome her to the battle she will now be fighting for women's rights and all things yeah that'll be awesome if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT
