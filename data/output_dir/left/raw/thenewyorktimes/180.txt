1
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,680
“What you see in the
video is the shooter

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,390
talking about how he’s
going to get to the school

3
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,980
in an Uber,

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,260
what time he’s going
leave, then what’s

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,670
going to happen when
he gets to the school,

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,660
what type of weapon

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,560
he’s going to have.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,619
And then he actually mimics
the sound of a shooting

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,810
at the end of the video.”

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,020
“He comes off as very callous
and pleased with himself.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,120
He’s also using violence to
enhance his sense of self

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,550
by becoming famous,
and this is something

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,820
that we’ve seen in other
school shooters as well.”

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,340
“It’s becoming very common
for these individuals

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,750
to publicize their event. We
refer to it as leakage, which

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,970
is communication to a
third party of intent

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,140
to attack, wanting it

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,450
to typically be
discovered within hours

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,670
or days of the event itself.”

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,150
“The way in which school
shooters broadcast the plans

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,011
beforehand differs: For some
it’s video, for some it’s social media posts,

22
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,850
for some it’s one-on-one
conversation with a friend

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,500
or someone they know online,

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,990
for some they indicate
their plans or intentions

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,270
through homework assignments
and through poetry

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,210
that they hand in to
an English teacher, for example.”

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,990
"When I first
did the F.B.I.’s research

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,290
on the first 18 shootings,
which included shootings

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,650
in the 1980s and the 1990s
and included Columbine,

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,370
the only one where I recalled
where there was a manifesto

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,020
video was Columbine.

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,080
My recommendation was that
those videotapes never be

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,980
released to the public ever.

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,590
And they never were, because
they were so chilling

35
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,180
and so matter of fact.

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,240
And so compelling
that it could

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,540
cause someone else to consider
carrying out that act.

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,640
People never got a
hold of those tapes.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,440
But so much other
information was

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,100
released on that shooting
that it has taken on a folk hero

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,600
status, unfortunately.”

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,860
“Not all school
shooters have role models.

43
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,410
But when they do
have a role model

44
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,020
it is most commonly
the perpetrators

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,788
of the attack at Columbine.”

46
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,770
“Many school shooters
have researched how

47
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,080
Columbine was carried out.

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,270
Researched the
motivations. And we

49
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,940
see that intense
media coverage

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,250
of any one of these
school shootings

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,540
adds to that research base
for future school shooters.”

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,480
“There have been over 80
events since Columbine

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
in 1999 in the United States
that have been inspired

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,940
by that particular event.

55
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,370
And these individuals
will typically

56
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,470
study previous attackers.

57
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,750
They want to do two things:

58
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,740
They want to imitate
those attackers,

59
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,685
and then also they want
to do them one better.”

60
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,580
“We have data going back now
20 years that shows in about 60%

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,490
of these cases, these individuals
will leak their intent.”

62
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,550
“The theme of these videos
tends to remain the same:

63
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,590
This is who I am.

64
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,240
This is what I’m going to do.

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,866
This is how I’m
going to do it.

66
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,240
And here are the
reasons that I’m

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,540
going to do it. 
So it’s almost a script

68
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,460
that they all follow.”

69
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,070
“And the manifesto may
serve several purposes.

70
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,610
In some cases, it is
to let themselves be

71
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,220
known to go down in history.

72
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,100
In other cases, it may be
used to justify the attack

73
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,530
by focusing on how
they’ve been victimized

74
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,960
by various injustices.

75
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,970
Some shooters use
it as an opportunity

76
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,970
to engage in some sort
of social critique.”

77
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,900
“This video like
so many others,

78
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,230
whether it’s in video
form or social media

79
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,590
post or direct conversation
or communication,

80
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,180
to me it often signals

81
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,340
what we see in a suicide note.

82
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,160
And the reason why it’s
important to think about it

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
from a suicide
note perspective

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,610
is that we have so many
tools and resources

85
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,080
available to help
someone who is suicidal

86
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,310
and we often don’t
think to use them when

87
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,970
we’re worried about
a school threat.

88
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,820
And so many cases,
it’s exactly

89
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,980
the type of
intervention or resource

90
00:04:04,980 --> 00:00:00,000
that can make a critical
difference and prevent harm.”
