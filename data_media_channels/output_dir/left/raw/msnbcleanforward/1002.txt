IS WORTH THE RISK. AND THE RISK HERE IS BOTH

165
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,559
AND THE RISK HERE IS BOTH LITIGATING IT AND PERHAPS LOSING

166
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,694
LITIGATING IT AND PERHAPS LOSING IT, ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT’S

167
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,863
IT, ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT’S UNLIKELY, AS WELL AS THE

168
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:22,665
UNLIKELY, AS WELL AS THE ATTENDANT DELAY.

169
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,633
ATTENDANT DELAY. AGAIN, BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE TO

170
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,168
AGAIN, BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE TO SPEAK TO EVERYBODY IN AN

171
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:26,902
SPEAK TO EVERYBODY IN AN INVESTIGATION, YOU CAN SPEAK TO

172
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:27,836
INVESTIGATION, YOU CAN SPEAK TO ENOUGH PEOPLE AND LOOK AT ENOUGH

173
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:29,571
ENOUGH PEOPLE AND LOOK AT ENOUGH DOCUMENTS TO HAVE AN IDEA, A

174
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:30,939
DOCUMENTS TO HAVE AN IDEA, A VERY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE

175
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,442
VERY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID AND WHY HE DID IT.

176
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:34,176
PRESIDENT DID AND WHY HE DID IT. DO I THINK THAT BOB MUELLER WILL

177
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:35,244
DO I THINK THAT BOB MUELLER WILL SUBPOENA THE PRESIDENT?

178
00:04:35,245 --> 00:00:00,000
SUBPOENA THE PRESIDENT? I REALLY DON’T KNOW, BRIAN.
