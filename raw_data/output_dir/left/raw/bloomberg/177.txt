66
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,955

HIRING CLOSE TO 900,000 PEOPLE  

188
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,645
AND IT'S EASILY ADJUSTED TO 160 

189
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,646
OR 1 70.

190
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,914
>> SIX TO ONE.

191
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,183
AND THAT'S A NET NUMBER YOU'RE  

192
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:44,850
GIVING US?

193
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,885
>> YES. 

194
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,019
A NET NUMBER OF HIRINGS.

195
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,055
>> AND THE ADJUSTMENT IS THAT 

196
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:50,456
MUCH? 

197
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,924
>> YES. 

198
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,260
SO 36,000 OUT FOR VERIZON IS  

199
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,328
REALLY ,000 BUT PEOPLE ARE  

200
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,063
GOING TO MAKE LOTS OF NOISE 

201
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:59,165
ABOUT THIS. 

202
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,366
FRANKLY I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT 

203
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,369
THE NUMBER AND MORE INTERESTED  

204
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,470
IN THE WAGE NUMBER BECAUSE  

205
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,238
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT  

206
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,241
ON PROFITS AND LIT TELL US  

207
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,377
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON 

208
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,181
WITH THAT.

209
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,583
>> I WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE WAGE  

210
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,652
NUMBER BUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT 

211
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,352
NUMBER. 

212
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,588
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN  

213
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,522
THE WAGE NUMBER.

214
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,725
THE MORE RETIREES WE HAVE, THE  

215
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:28,460
LOWER THAT IS GOING TO GO 

216
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,530
BECAUSE YOU'RE REPLACING  

217
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,566
HIGHER-PAID WORKERS WITH  

218
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,466
LOWER-PAID WORKERS. 

219
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,502
JUST LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT 

220
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,536
NUMBER. 

221
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,605
IF THAT IS DROPPING THAT MEANS  

222
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,540
WAGES ARE GOING TO START  

223
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,641
PICKING UP. 

224
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,710
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT WAGES, AND  

225
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,746
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE LABOR FORCE 

226
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,715
PAY RATE WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN AN 

227
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,884
ISSUE, WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE  

228
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,788
FROM THOSE WAGES? 

229
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,957
THAT REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 

230
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:58,891
THAT POPS UP? 

231
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,093
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE 

232
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,995
NUMBER PEOPLE THAT ARE CHANGING 

233
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,930
JOBS AND UNFILLED JOBS. 

234
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,299
TO FILL THOSE JOBS WE HAVE TO 

235
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:07,766
RAISE WAGES.

236
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:10,836
WE SORT OF DEALT WITH THE ISSUE 

237
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,873
OF GETTING WHAT I CALL THE OIL  

238
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,007
WORKERS OUT OF THE NUMBER 

239
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,909
BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PAID  

240
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,043
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. 

241
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,880
WHAT I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IS 

242
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,148
.2 OR .3% OF AN INCREASE ON 

243
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:27,019
WHAT I CALL THE AVERAGE WEEKLY  

244
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,887
WAGE THAT'S TAKING PLACE. 

245
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:32,157
IF YOU ADD 160 OR 1270,000  

246
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:33,959
PEOPLE TO THE WORKFORCE IT'S  

247
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,028
EASILY ADJUSTED, YOU'RE GOING 

248
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,997
TO HAVE TOTAL AVAILABLE FUNDS 

249
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:43,869
TO SPEND IN THE ECONOMY.

250
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,138
>> DREW MADDOX, PUTTING ALL 

251
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,108
THIS TOGETHER, WE ARE ABOUT TO  

252
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:54,346
SEE SUB200,000 AGAIN AND AGAIN  

253
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,981
SOMETHING AROUND 150, THAT'S  

254
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,183
GOING TO BE CONSIDERED HEALTHY, 

255
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:01,053
BECAUSE AS YOU REACH EMPLOYMENT 

256
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,088
-- BUT LET'S SAY THAT HAPPENS 

257
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,457
AND WE DON'T GET THE WAGE TO GO 

258
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:07,393
ALONG WITH IT, WHAT DOES THE  

259
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:07,826
FED DO? 

260
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,262
>> I THINK THE FED GOES BACK TO 

261
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,399
WHAT IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 

262
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,333
DOING?

263
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,802
IT WILL BE DRIVING UNEMPLOYMENT 

264
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,470
RATE LOWER AND LOWER AND  

265
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,439
EVENTUALLY WHAT THAT IS GOING 

266
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,441
TO SPARK IS PRESSURE FOR PEOPLE 

267
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,342
TO BID AWAY WORKERS.

268
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,378
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO SEE 

269
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,648
WITH WAGES TO GO UP IS IF YOUR  

270
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,684
NEIGHBOR QUITS THEIR JOB AND  

271
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,686
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S NEIGHBOR QUITS  

272
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,721
THEIR JOB, PRETTY SOON YOUR 

273
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,857
FIRM IS GOING TO SAY WE EITHER  

274
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,926
WANT THIS GUY OR HE IS GOING TO 

275
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,896
QUIT AND THAT WILL DRIVE WAGES  

276
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,631
HIGHER. 

277
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,766
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO SEE IS MORE 

278
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,735
PEOPLE QUITTING THEIR JOBS AND  

279
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,770
THAT WILL MAKE WAGES HIGHER.

280
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,606
>> HAVEN'T WE ALREADY SEEN A  

281
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,709
BIG INCREASE IN THE QUIT RATE?

282
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,711
YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO GO  

283
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,678
HIGHER? 

284
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,679
>> YES. 

285
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,952
AND WE PERVERSELY NEED TO SEE 

286
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,787
JOBS DO MORE FIRING.

287
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:13,092
THEY NEED TO SEE LOW PERFORMERS 

288
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,059
BECAUSE FIRMS WOULD RATHER KEEP 

289
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,028
THE PERSON THEY HAVE ON THAT  

290
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,930
MIGHT BE UNDERPERFORMING THAN 

291
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,932
CHURNING THEM OUT AND ACTUALLY  

292
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,233
REPLACING THEM, TRADING THEM  

293
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:21,967
UP. 

294
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,969
IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY.

295
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,337
SOUNDS HARD BUT THE PERSON WHO  

296
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,174
GETS CHURNED OUT, THEY MAY GO 

297
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,111
TO A PLACE THAT IS BETTER FOR 

298
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,579
THEM AND THE FIRM MIGHT BE MORE 

299
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,047
PRODUCTIVE. 

300
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,251
>> JOBS THAT -- AVAILABLE JOB 

301
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,188
OPENINGS HAS BEEN FLYING QUITE  

302
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,323
AGGRESSIVELY SINCE THE  

303
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,525
FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWEEVERPB 

304
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,226
2009. 

305
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,263
I BELIEVE IT'S THE WHITE LINE 

306
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,233
ON THAT SHOT WHAT ELSE DO YOU 

307
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,435
LOOK AT IN 12 MINUTES' TIME TO  

308
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,404
REALLY GAUGE WHAT'S HAPPENING 

309
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,406
IN THIS LABOR MARKET? 

310
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,307
>> WELL CLAIMS ARE MY NUMBER  

311
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:03,308
ONE THING.

312
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:06,445
IF NO ONE'S BEING FIRED THEN  

313
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,280
NOTHING IS -- QUOTE, UNQUOTE, 

314
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,681
BAD IS HAPPENING IN THE 

315
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:10,249
ECONOMY.

316
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,552
IF A FIRM WERE IN REAL TROUBLE, 

317
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,320
THEY WOULD BE FIRING PEOPLE AND 

318
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,425
WE'RE NOT SEEING ANYONE FIRE SO 

319
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,661
WE NEED TO BREAK OUT OF THAT  

320
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,930
AND SEE MORE CHURNING IN THE  

321
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,531
LABOR MARKET. 

322
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,700
>> DREW, WE ALSO HEAR FROM  

323
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,902
ECONOMISTS THAT THE AVERAGE 

324
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:30,936
HOURS WORKED IS A CRITICAL  

325
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,771
NUMBER. 

326
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,806
IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU? 

327
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,076
>> IT IS, AND MY COLLEAGUE SAM  

328
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,878
HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS, 

329
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:45,150
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT ON AN 

330
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,854
INDUSTRY-BY-STRI BASIS, IT  

331
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,824
TELLS US IF YOU WANT TO BOOST 

332
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,959
OUTPUT YOU CAN'T ADD HOURS  

333
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,796

334

IN A SECTOR-BY-SECTOR BASIS.

335
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,938

338

EXTEND YOUR OUTPUT, YOU WOULD 

339

SEND MORE OVERTIME. 

340
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,881
I'M NOT SURE THAT HAPPENS AS  

341
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,850
MUCH IN THE SERVICES. 

342

THE OVERALL DATA QUALITY. 

345

THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

IN A LEAD VOTE IN MARKETS.

385
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,802

IT ABOUT GROWTH OR STABILITY? 

391

393
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:11,883

00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:19,064
AND WAGE GROWTH IN LINE AT 2.5%.

553
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:19,898
ONE MAN WITH A VIEW ON THE BOND

554
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,533
MARKET AND THE LABOR MARKET

555
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:23,301
DATA, BILL GROSS, OF JANUS

556
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:33,010
CAPITAL.

557
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,979
TOM: BILL, THIS IS SUCH A

558
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,115
STUNNING REPORT.

559
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,317
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP DR.

560
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,051
GLASSMAN WITH US FOR A FEW

561
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,852
MINUTES.

562
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,254
BILL, THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE

563
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,022
SPOKEN ABOUT IN YOUR NOSE FOR

564
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,258
YEARS.

565
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,059
WITHIN ALL OF THE CONSENSUS,

566
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,061
THERE CAN ALWAYS BE A SHOCK.

567
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,896
IS THIS REPORT ENOUGH OF A SHOCK

568
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:56,935
TO ALTER FED ACTION?

569
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,438
BILL: I THINK IT IS ENOUGH OF A

570
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,206
SHOCK TO DELAY JUNE AND INTO

571
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:02,740
JULY FOR SURE.

572
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,511
THE FED IS TRYING TO CONVINCE US

573
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,345
THAT ONE OR TWO HIKES THIS YEAR

574
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:07,845
IS IN THE CARDS.

575
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:13,418
I THINK THEY WANT THEM TO BE

576
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,252
NORMALIZED AND THE YIELD CURVE

577
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,655
TO BE NORMALIZED.

578
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,024
BUT THIS CANCELS OUT JUNE IN

579
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,160
COMBINATION WITH BRIGHT'S IT --

580
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:30,801
WITH BREXIT.

581
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:31,602
MIKE: THE FED CARES MUCH LESS

582
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:34,305
ABOUT THE NONFARM NUMBER

583
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,006
MONTH-TO-MONTH THAN THEY DO

584
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,008
ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE --

585
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,310
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

586
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,913
BILL: IT IS, THEY DO.

587
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,581
AT 4.7%, THE PERCENTAGE RATE IS

588
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,016
DOWN A FEW TICKS AND THAT IS

589
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:50,020
PERHAPS PART OF IT.

590
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,755
IT IS A CONFUSING REPORT.

591
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,056
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND JIM

592
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:56,327
GLASSMAN THAT BASICALLY IT IS A

593
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,128
NORMAL REPORT WITHOUT THE NUMBER

594
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,397
IN TERMS OF PAYROLL.

595
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,499
SO WE WILL HAVE TO SEE GOING

596
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,667
FORWARD.

597
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,835
TOM: THIS IS REMARKABLE.

598
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,702
DR. GLASSMAN, I WANT YOU TO GIVE

599
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,539
US A PERSPECTIVE TO HELP.

600
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:13,544
THE TWO-YEAR YIELD, MAY I

601
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:14,278
SUGGEST THE MARKET AND THE

602
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,414
VIGILANTES ARE A BIT AWAY FROM

603
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,517
THE DOTS?

604
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,487
MR. GLASSMAN: IT IS NOT CLEAR.

605
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,354
PEOPLE HAVE A MORE PESSIMISTIC

606
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,189
VIEW OF THE OUTLOOK OR THE

607
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:26,457
EQUITY MARKET DOESN'T SEEM TO

608
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:26,924
SHARE THAT.

609
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:28,793
OR IS IT THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT

610
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,660
THE FED IS JUST WANT TO BE A LOT

611
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,128
MORE CAUTIOUS?

612
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,629
AND IT IS A GLOBAL ECONOMY.

613
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:36,167
WE ARE MUCH MORE INTERCONNECTED.

614
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:36,901
RATE PLUS ZERO ELSEWHERE.

615
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,238
WE ARE FEELING ALL OF THAT.

616
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,105
MIKE: I WANTED TO THROW IN HERE

617
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:41,873
THAT I LOOKED UP THE NUMBERS.

618
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:47,111
37,000 PEOPLE OFF THE

619
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:47,845
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CATEGORY.

620
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:48,546
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE NET

621
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:52,149
[INDISCERNIBLE]

622
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,852
TOM: ONE MORE QUESTION WITH YOU,

623
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:55,319
JIM GLASSMAN.

624
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,120
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A NEGATIVE

625
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,656
STATISTIC AND WE ADD IN 37,000

626
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,257
NOISE FROM VERIZON.

627
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,026
THIS IS WITHIN THE DISPERSION

628
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,163
MONTH-TO-MONTH.

629
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:05,930
HELP BILL GROSS HERE.

630
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,899
THIS IS AN OUTLINE REPORT GOOD

631
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,767
OF JIM: THE BLS WILL TELL YOU

632
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:10,568
THAT THE STANDARD ERROR IS

633
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,269
2000.

634
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,136
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.

635
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,974
THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE.

636
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,043
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY REPORTER

637
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:19,977
LOOK TO FOR GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS

638
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:20,711
GOING ON IN THE JOB MARKET.

639
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,181
JOBLESS CLAIMS ARE AT VERY LOW

640
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:23,648
LEVELS.

641
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,185
THE ADP SURVEY IS IN THE FOR --

642
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:31,422
IN THE BALLPARK, STEADY.

643
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,523
WE HAVE A SEPARATE INDEPENDENT

644
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,759
REPORT ON THE LABOR MARKET.

645
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,526
I WOULD SAY THE HEADLINE IS

646
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,762
PROBABLY THE ABERRATION.

647
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:38,629
TOM: JIM, THANK YOU FOR STAYING

648
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:40,632
LONGER THAN USUAL.

649
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,466
L GROSS, YOU JUST HEARD ONE OF

650
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,201
OUR GREAT MARKET ECONOMISTS GO

651
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:43,835
THROUGH THE MINUTIA.

652
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,304
DO YOU TRUST MINUTIA ANYMORE?

653
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:51,642
BILL: IT IS HARD TO TRUST MANY

654
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:52,076
NUMBERS.

655
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,244
LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.

656
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:58,516
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT -- IT IS

657
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,986
IN THE FAVOR OF THE FED TO BIAS

658
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:12,529
THE DOTS TO THE HIGHEST SIDE.

659
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,999
IT IS AS FLAT AS IT HAS BEEN FOR

660
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,634
THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS.

661
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,903
NET INTEREST MARGINS ON BANKS

662
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,404
AND PRODUCING A FLAT CURVE THAT

663
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:24,375
IS REALLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE

664
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:24,942
CAPITAL GROWTH.

665
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:25,710
SO THERE IS A BIAS ON THE SIDE

666
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,312
OF THE FED TO MAKE THE MARKET

667
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:29,380
BELIEVES SOMEHOW WE WILL SEE 2,

668
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,985
3, 4, GOING FORWARD IN THE NEXT

669
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:34,752
SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT IS THE

670
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,787
REASON WHY WE SEE THAT.

671
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,587
TOM: BILL, WE COULD KEEP YOU

672
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:40,358
OFFER FOR FIVE HOURS ON THIS

673
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:40,892
SHOCKING REPORT.

674
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,726
I WANT YOU, BILL GROSS, TWOFOLD

675
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:47,865
IN THE LARGER MAP REVIEW.

676
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:53,304
THE YEN'S ABENOMICS -107.91.

677
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,138
I KNOW YOU WENT LONG ON GERMAN

678
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,842
10 YEAR ON MONDAY, BILL.

679
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,710
THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON

680
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,511
HERE, BILL, ON AN INTERNATIONAL

681
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,647
BASIS THAT CHAIR YELLEN WILL

682
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,716
HAVE TO DIGEST.

683
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,018
IS IT THE FOLLOW-ON ON GLOBAL

684
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,820
DEFLATION AND DISINFLATION?

685
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,522
BILL: LET'S BE FAIR.

686
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,089
IT'S BOTH.

687
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:14,425
CENTRAL BANKS APPLYING

688
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,529
QUANTITATIVE EASING IN EURO LAND

689
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,767
AND IN JAPAN ARE RESPONDING TO

690
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,501
THE POTENTIAL FOR DEFLATION.

691
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,268
THERE IS RELATIVELY NO INFLATION

692
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,704
IN EURO LAND AND NO INFLATION IN

693
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:27,104
JAPAN.

694
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:27,772
SO THAT IS THE RESPONSE.

695
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,707
BUT TO BE FAIR, THE REASON

696
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,010
INTEREST RATES ARE THIS LOW IS

697
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,779
NOT ONLY THE POLICY RATES BEING

698
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,580
SET BY CENTRAL BANKS, BUT $80

699
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,115
BILLION A MONTH THAT THE ECB IS

700
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:38,883
BUYING AND NOW THEY ARE BUYING

701
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:39,417
CORPORATE BONDS.

702
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,786
THAT IS A LOT OF FIREPOWER.

703
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,922
TO SEE THE 10-YEAR GERMAN BUND

704
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:53,998
AT -- GERMAN BUNDES AT SEVEN.

705
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:59,971
IT IS RELATIVELY DISRUPTIVE IN

706
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,140
THE LONG TERM FOR CAPITAL.

707
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,875
TOM: MICHAEL MCKEE AND TOM KEENE

708
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:05,643
OFF A STUNNING JOBS REPORT.

709
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,080
WE ARE THRILLED TO BRING YOU

710
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,947
BILL GROSS OF JENNA'S CAPITAL

711
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,516
HERE UNTIL THE 9:00 HOUR.

712
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:13,384
MIKE: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

713
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,253
YOU MAKE OF THIS NUMBER.

714
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,022
DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

715
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,424
JANET YELLEN SPEAKS ON MONDAY.

716
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,993
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SAYS GIVEN

717
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,594
THE FED POSTURE TOWARDS INTEREST

718
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:26,397
RATES IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

719
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,197
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FED WHAT --

720
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:32,536
THE FED'S CREDIT ABILITY?

721
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,071
BILL: I THINK SHE CONTINUES TO

722
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,641
SAY IT.

723
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:38,409
AND SHE HAS CHANGED A LITTLE

724
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:38,743
BIT.

725
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,277
SHE WAS HAWKISH, THEN RELATIVELY

726
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,612
HAWKISH, NOW DOVISH AND INCLINED

727
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,446
TO MOVE HIGHER OVER THE NEXT SIX

728
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:45,516
TO 12 MONTHS.

729
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,885
I THINK SHE IS BEING INFLUENCED

730
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:51,522
BY MANY OF THE FED GOVERNORS, TO

731
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,255
TRY TO RE-NORMALIZE INTEREST

732
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,859
RATES.

733
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,661
THERE IS A CONTINGENT THAT

734
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,429
BELIEVES, AND I BELIEVED THIS

735
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,999
FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS, THEN

736
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:02,800
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND LOW

737
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,567
INTEREST RATES ARE DESTRUCTIVE

738
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:04,201
FOR BUSINESS MODELS AND

739
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:08,272
ULTIMATELY FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH

740
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,173
HERE IN MY DON'T THINK THE FED

741
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:09,940
REALLY HAS THAT IN THEIR MODEL

742
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,341
MAKING.

743
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,075
BUT ULTIMATELY, JANET YELLEN

744
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,510
WILL CONTINUE TO SUGGEST ONE OR

745
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,780
TWO HIKES OVER THE BALANCE OF

746
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,884
2016 AND PERHAPS THE SAME FOR

747
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:20,251
2017.

748
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,686
UNLESS WE GET BACK TO ONE OR

749
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,420
1.5% OR 2% NORMAL SHORT-TERM

750
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,790
INTEREST RATES.

751
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,225
THEN THE MANY BUSINESS MODELS

752
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:29,026
AND GERMAN COMPANIES AND BANKS

753
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,561
AND PENSION FUNDS, HOUSEHOLD

754
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,497
SAVERS ARE BASICALLY IN DEEP,

755
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:37,001
DEEP DO DO.

756
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,036
MIKE: THAT'S A TECHNICAL TERM.

757
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,905
[LAUGHTER]

758
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:48,645
WHAT IS YOUR DOT PLOT.

759
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:49,480
WITH THE FED GOING FORWARD, YOU

760
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,215
SUGGEST MAYBE JULY.

761
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,083
HOW QUICKLY DO THEY MOVE GOING

762
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,986
INTO 2017?

763
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,254
BILL: I THINK THEY WAIT UNTIL

764
00:35:57,254 --> 00:36:00,558
DECEMBER AND DO IT GRADUALLY.

765
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,392
I THINK THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE

766
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,095
TYPE OF APPROACH.

767
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:08,132
A HIGH LOVE LITTLE -- A HIGHLY

768
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,134
LEVERAGED DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND

769
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,369
WORLD ECONOMY TO THE EXTENT THAT

770
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,203
THE U.S. IS THE LEADER IN TERMS

771
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,640
OF INTEREST RATES.

772
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,474
THE GLOBAL CENTRAL BANK, TO THE

773
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,209
EXTENT THAT THEY MOVE TOO FAST

774
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,344
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ANOTHER

775
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,114
LEHMAN IN 2017 ARE 2018.

776
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:23,781
I THINK IT IS GRADUAL.

777
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,417
THERE IS ONE MORE HIKE AFTER

778
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:30,755
THAT.

779
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:31,522
TOM: STAN E-MAILED INTO OUR

780
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,825
BLOOMBERG RADIO STUDIOS AND SAID

781
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,260
THE REASON WHY THE JOBS REPORT

782
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,795
IS SO BAD IS BECAUSE EVERYONE IS

783
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,429
LEAVING THE COUNTRY.

784
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:46,604
MIKE: I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO

785
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:46,971
THERE.

786
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:47,704
THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY.

787
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:48,372
TOM: FUTURES ARE FLAT NOW.

788
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,041
THEY ARE NOW -7.

789
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,841
YIELDS, YIELDS, YIELDS, BILL

790
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,443
GROSS, MAKING MONEY TODAY.

791
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,713
BILL GROSS, MINTING MONEY, THE

TWO-YEAR, .79%.

793
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,350
A LITTLE BIT OF CURVE STEEPING,

794
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:06,657
BUT YET A STUNNING 1.07 90.

795
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:11,395
YOU TALKED ABOUT PENTHOUSE

796
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:11,829
MANAGERS.

797
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,900
HOW BIG IS THE BUBBLE RIGHT NOW?

798
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,736
BILL: I THINK IT'S BIG.

799
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,738
AND YOU'LL NOTICE WITH NEGATIVE

800
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,440
INTEREST RATES AND 40% OR 50% OF

801
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,541
THE DEVELOPED MARKET WORLD,

802
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,341
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS

803
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:28,946
A BUBBLE WITH 25 BASIS POINTS ON

804
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:33,818
THE FIVE-YEAR.

805
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,121
THAT THAT IS A MARKET BUBBLE IS

806
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:37,755
ALMOST UNDENIABLE.

807
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,123
TO MY WAY OF THINKING, THE

808
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:39,890
MARKETS HAVE A LONG TIME TO

809
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,394
ADJUST TO THESE INTEREST RATES

810
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,128
AS THEY HAVE MOVED LOWER.

811
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,963
EQUITY PRICES IN TERMS OF EQUITY

812
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,800
RATIOS, IT'S ALL GOT TO BE

813
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,601
CONNECTED TO SOME EXTENT AND IT

814
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,402
IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU

815
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,605
GET TO EQUITY RISKS.

816
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,473
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE

817
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,173
ARE BUBBLES AND FINANCIAL

818
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,143
MARKETS, DISTORTING THE REAL

819
00:37:59,143 --> 00:37:59,577
ECONOMY.

820
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,979
AND AT SOME POINT, A

821
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,047
RENORMALIZATION IS GOING TO

822
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,116
BEGIN TO AFFECT THEM ALL IN

823
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:08,452
TERMS OF TOTAL RETURN.

824
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,220
TOM: WHAT WILL JANET YELLEN

825
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,788
FOCUS ON?

826
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,857
DOES SHE FOCUS ON THE ORTHODOX

827
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,092
OF ECONOMICS?

828
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:15,793
DOES SHE FOCUS ON SOME NEW

829
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,563
ECONOMICS?

830
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,464
DOES SHE FOCUS ON YOUR FINANCIAL

831
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,932
SYSTEM AS SHE DRESSED TO GET NOT

832
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,567
ONLY TO JUNE AND JULY, BUT

833
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,335
FRIENDLY TO GET INTO THE THIRD

834
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,636
AND FOURTH ORDER THIS YEAR?

835
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,539
WHICH SHE FOCUS ON?

836
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,974
BILL -- WHAT SHOULD SHE FOCUS

837
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,411
ON?

838
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,479
BILL: I THINK IN A YELLEN'S

839
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,681
CONVENTIONAL, WHICH IS

840
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:38,482
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WE ARE IN A

841
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,149
NEW FINANCIAL ERROR THAT

842
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:45,523
REQUIRES A DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT.

843
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:53,597
-- FINANCIAL ERA THAT

844
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:57,802
REQUIRES A DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT.

845
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:58,669
I THINK YELLEN COME ALTHOUGH SHE

846
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,538
IS IN CHARGE, AND SHE HAS MADE

847
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:04,842
IT VERY CLEAR THROUGH HER PRESS

848
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,976
CONFERENCES COME I THINK YELLEN

849
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:06,744
IS CONVENTIONAL AND PROBABLY

850
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:07,478
WILL CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

851
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:11,982
LOWER INTEREST RATES STIMULATE

852
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:12,683
ASSET PRICES AND THAT THE

853
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,253
TRICKLE DOWN FROM ASSET PRICES

854
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:16,954
STIMULATES REAL GROWTH.

855
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:17,755
THAT HAS BEEN A FAILURE TO THE

856
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,857
WE DESTINED MY WAY OF THINKING

857
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,058
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

858
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:21,859
BUT SHE WILL STICK TO THAT WE

859
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,029
WILL HAVE TO SEE IN TERMS OF

860
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,696
POLICY GOING FORWARD.

861
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,064
BUT I THINK SOMETHING NEW AND

862
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,733
SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS REQUIRED.

863
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,868
MIKE: IS THIS A DANGEROUS TIME

864
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,237
IN THE MARKETS AND A DANGEROUS

865
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,905
-- A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE FED

866
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:35,673
TO INTERPRET WHAT THE MARKETS

867
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,742
ARE SAYING?

868
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,110
IF THEY ARE DISTORTED BY THE

869
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,045
FED, THEY HAVE TO REACT TO THIS

870
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,478
NUMBER,.

871
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:49,086
YOU'VE GOT THE BREXIT DEBATE

872
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:49,587
COMING UP.

873
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,221
SHOULD THEY TURN OFF A BLOOMBERG

874
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:51,989
MACHINES AND MAKE A DECISION

875
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,291
WITHOUT LOOKING AT EVERYTHING?

876
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,125
BILL: TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

877
00:39:55,125 --> 00:40:00,464
ARE A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL VIEWS

878
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,033
IS INFORMATIVE, BUT NONETHELESS

879
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,603
CONFUSING TO SOME EXTENT.

880
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:06,503
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SHUT IT

881
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,339
DOWN ONCE YOU TURN IT OFF.

882
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,173
BUT TO SOME EXTENT COME I THINK

883
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:14,612
THEY SHOULD -- BUT TO SOME

884
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:15,479
EXTENT, I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE

885
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,249
A STANDARD MESSAGE.

886
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,052

AVERAGE WEEKLY HOURS UNCHANGED.

891
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:40,304
THE NUMBERS ARE NOT BAD.

892
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:45,676
TOM: THE IMMEDIATE DURATION CAME

893
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,443
INTO A CONSTRUCTIVE PLACE AS

894
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:46,777
WELL.

895
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,411
I WOULD SUGGEST WHAT IS

896
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:52,449
DIFFERENT HERE IS LAST TIME, WE

897
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,217

MARKET MOVING AND RETRACING.

899
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,389
WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE BOND

900
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,392
MARKET, WITH PRICES UP AND

901
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,726
YIELDS DOWN LIKE THIS, DOES BILL

902
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:03,527
GROSS GET OFF THE TELEVISION AND

903
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:08,466

904
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,835
BELL: I THINK YOU BEGIN TO

905
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:12,403
REDUCE DURATION.

906
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,105
THAT WAS ONE OF THE WINDS OF MY

907
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,174
INVESTMENT OUTLOOK WHEN I TALKED

908
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:17,908
ABOUT THE PENTHOUSE AND THE

909
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:18,676
OCCUPANTS CHANGING OVER TIME.

910
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,945
WE HAVE HAD A FOUR-YOUR PERIOD

911
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:22,680
OF HIGHER PRICES AND LOWER

912
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,516
YIELDS, HIGHER STOCK RISES, 10%

913
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,784
ON STOCKS AND 7% ON BONDS.

914
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,688
AT THESE LEVELS AND WITH LOWER

915
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,890
LEVELS TODAY COME AT SOME POINT,

916
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,657
AND INVESTOR HAS TO BEGIN TO

917
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,392
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE

918
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,663
BUBBLE-TYPES OF LEVELS AND THE

919
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,431

00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,934
ONLY IMPLICIT IN LONGER

00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,572
SPREADS OR IN TERMS OF

924
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,675
VOLATILITY -- YEAH, AND INVESTOR

925
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,813
HAS TO REDUCE CARRY BY HOLDING

926
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,047
MORE IN CASH AND LOWERING

927
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:57,948
DURATION, SELLING FOR BONDS

928
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,017
TODAY, AS YOUR QUESTIONS

929
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,151
SUGGESTS.

930
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,887
AND ULTIMATELY TRYING TO FIND A

931
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:06,490
REVERSAL.

932
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,357
I DON'T THINK IT IS AT THAT

933
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:10,027
POINT NOW.

934
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,297
BUT AT SOME POINT, IT WILL BE

935
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,064
BETTER SERVED BY SELLING AS

936
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,100
OPPOSED TO BUYING PROGRAM TOM:

937
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,272
-- BUYING.

938
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,475
TOM: I DO WANT TO GET TO MEXICO

939
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:24,875
LATER.

940
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,576
BUT RIGHT NOW, I WANT YOU TO

941
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,279
ADDRESS THE SHOCK OF A NUMBER OF

942
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,414
YEARS AGO WHEN BILL GROSS SAID

943
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,048
WE WOULD HAVE FINANCIAL

944
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,682
REPRESSION FOR DECADES.

945
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,251
I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING AT MY

946
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:38,856
BLOOMBERG'S SCREEN, YOU ARE

947
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:39,656
PREPARED TO REAFFIRM THAT THIS

948
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:41,292
MORNING.

949
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,027
BILL: I THINK THAT'S TRUE.

950
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:44,828
THAT IS HOW CENTRAL BANKS DO IT

951
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:45,596
OR THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS GET

952
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,497
OUT OF A DECK ISIS.

953
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,600
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS.

954
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,300
YOU CAN GROW OUT OF IT.

955
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,402
WE ARE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB

956
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:55,573
OF THAT.

957
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,340
OR YOU CAN HOLD NEGATIVE

958
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,876
INTEREST RATE, NEGATIVE REAL

959
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,676
INTEREST RATES COME IN ORDER TO

960
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:00,377
BASICALLY TAKE MONEY OUT OF

961
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:12,589
SAVERS'S MARKETS -- POCKETS.

962
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:14,758
THEY BASICALLY STRIP SAVERS OF

963
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,926
THE REAL INVESTMENT.

964
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:20,931
SO HOW LONG WILL THIS CONTINUED?

965
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,799
THE BIBLICAL EXTENSION IN TERMS

966
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:22,800
OF SEVEN AND SEVEN.

967
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,170
WE HAD HIGH REALTORS RATES FOR

968
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,906
20 TO 25 YEARS.

969
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,640
PERHAPS WE NEED LONGER THAN

970
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,674
SEVEN IN ORDER TO REBALANCE.

971
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,710
TOM COLE AND WITHIN A BIBLICAL

972
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,812
SPAN, WE HAVE NOT HAD A

973
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,181
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS.

974
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:37,981
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR PRISM OF

975
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:42,453
FINANCE AND ECONOMICS AND YOU

976
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,253
PUT IT OVER PRESIDENT CLINTON

977
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,121
ARE PRESIDENT TROMP, DO YOU HAVE

978
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,722
AN OPTIMISM THAT THEIR POLITICS

979
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:46,523
CAN DEAL WITH AMERICA'S

980
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,993
FINANCIAL REPRESSION?

981
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,995
BILL: I DON'T BECAUSE

982
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,030
GOVERNMENTS, TO MY WAY OF

983
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,797
THINKING, NEED SOME FISCAL

984
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,367
BALANCE ACTUALLY.

985
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,436
MONETARY AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN

986
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,204
TALKING ABOUT THE FISCAL SIDE

987
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,373
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW.

988
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,207
BERNANKE WAS THREE OR FOUR OR

989
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:08,011
FIVE YEARS AGO.

990
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:10,047
I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND MONEY,

991
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,215
BUT WE ARE NOT RELEASING THAT IN

992
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,083
JAPAN.

993
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,486
GERMANY IS A REALLY TIGHT SYSTEM

994
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:17,321
AND HAS A LAW THAT MAINTAINS A

995
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:17,921
FISCAL BALANCE BUDGET.

996
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,090
BOTH CLINTON AND TROMP ARE

997
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,327
INFLUENCED BY PREVAILING LOGIC

998
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,061
THAT SAYS YOU SHOULD TRY TO

999
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,063
BALANCE A BUDGET IN ORDER TO

1000
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,632
SOLVE THE DEBT CRISIS.

1001
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,466
I THINK THAT IS JUST THE WRONG

1002
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,435
WAY TO DO IT.

1003
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:35,739
I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND MONEY.

1004
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,506
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE

1005
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,809
INFRASTRUCTURE, ETC., ETC. 

1006
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,643
BUT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GET

1007
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,344
IN THERE AND START WRITING

1008
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,579
CHECKS AS OPPOSED TO THE PRIVATE

1009
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,850
SECTOR, WHICH IS NOT.

1010
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,618
MICHAEL AND REMEMBER BILL

1011
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,919
CLINTON IN 1993 SAID HE WANTED

1012
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:49,753
TO DIE AND COME BACK AS A BOND

1013
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,420
MARKET BECAUSE THEY RUN

1014
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:50,854
EVERYTHING?

1015
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,624
[LAUGHTER]

1016
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,693
YOU RUN EVERYTHING, THEREFORE,

1017
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,093
BILL.

1018
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:59,430
[LAUGHTER]

1019
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,231
IF THEY WERE TO DO SOME SORT OF

1020
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,366
PHYSICAL EFFORT, WHAT WOULD YOU

1021
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,434
TELL PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WHO ARE

1022
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,535
TERRIFIED THAT BY YIELDS ARE

1023
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:06,270
GOING TO GO UP AND THAT WILL

1024
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,772
COST US SO MUCH MONEY AND

1025
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:09,539
TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE TO PICK UP

1026
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:10,274
THE TAB AND IT IS A TERRIBLE

1027
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,508
THING?

1028
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,979
BILL: BOND YIELDS MIGHT GO UP TO

1029
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:16,847
CERTAINLY ON THE LONGER AND AND

1030
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,515
ON THE 10-YEAR END.

1031
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,985
TO MY WAY OF THINKING,

1032
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:22,719
REBALANCING OF THE FINANCIAL

1033
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,520
SECTOR, YES, DOES THAT COST SOME

1034
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,856
CORPORATIONS MONEY?

1035
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,290
YES.

1036
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,725
DOES THAT NARROW PROFIT MARGINS?

1037
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,028
YES.

1038
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:31,862
BUT TO MY WAY OF THINKING, THE

1039
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,697
FED HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON WALL

1040
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:38,535
STREET, HAS ALWAYS FOCUSED ON

1041
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:39,303
WALL STREET AS OPPOSED TO MAIN

1042
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:39,703
STREET.

1043
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,504
NOT THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT

1044
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:44,474
MAIN STREET, BUT IT'S ABOUT TIME

1045
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:45,242
THAT WAGES BECOME LESS OF A

1046
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:51,114
FOCUS AND THAT OTHER DISTORTIONS

1047
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:52,850
BECOME INTO PLAY.

1048
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,186
THAT A SAVINGS IS JUSTIFIED BY

1049
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,423
HIGHRIDGE OR STRAIGHTS.

1050
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,257
TOM: WE WANT TO SHOW THE MARKET

1051
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:04,327
REACTION.

1052
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:06,730
HERE IS THE TWO-YEAR CHART I

1053
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,197
SHOWED YOU.

1054
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:15,806
THESE ARE ALL SAN FRANCISCO 49ER

1055
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:16,573
LOSSES, ALL THE LAST SEASON.

1056
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:17,074
I'M KIDDING.

1057
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:17,841
THOSE ARE FOMC MEETINGS.

1058
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:18,542
BILL COME I WANT TO SHOW THE

1059
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:19,276
ABRUPT RETRACEMENT OF THE TWO

1060
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,177
YEAR YIELD.

1061
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,612
HERE WE SEE ENTHUSIASM WE HAVE

1062
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:23,347
HAD OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF

1063
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:23,714
MONTHS.

1064
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:27,284
AND IT IS A MASSIVE REVERSAL.

1065
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,454
-- REVERSAL IN THE TWO YEAR

1066
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,255
YIELD.

1067
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:35,793
MIKE: YOU OBVIOUSLY GET A

1068
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,593
KNEE-JERK REACTION TO NUMBERS

1069
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:37,027
LIKE THIS.

1070
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:37,761
MIAMI LOOKING AT THE W.A.R. P,

1071
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,964
FED FUNDS PROBABILITY OF A HIKE.

1072
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,367
WE ARE DOWN TO A 4% CHANCE OF A

1073
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,335
HIKE IN JUNE ACCORDING TO THIS.

1074
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,537
AND ONLY 30% CHANCE IN JULY.

1075
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:48,305
THOSE NUMBERS ARE STILL SEEING

1076
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:52,175
-- R'S -- THOSE TWO NUMBERS ARE

1077
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:54,578
TOO LOW FOR ME.

1078
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,581
IN JULY, YOU SAY THE FED'S DAYS

1079
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:02,319
ON TRACK.

1080
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,120
MAYBE WE ARE HEADING INTO A

1081
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,820
SLOWDOWN THAT WE SHOULD BE

1082
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,254
AFRAID OF.

1083
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,622
HE'LL: YOU COULD.

1084
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,557
I'M WITH YOU IN TERMS OF THE

1085
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:09,993
PROBABILITY FOR JULY.

1086
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:10,761
I THINK IT IS 50% OR MORE.

1087
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,296
BY LET'S GET BACK TO THE RECENT

1088
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:16,299
ECONOMIC STATISTICS.

1089
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:20,871
THE ATLANTA FED NOW SURVEY

1090
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,639
BASICALLY SAYS WE ARE LOOKING A

1091
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,109
2.8%, 2.9% REAL GDP QUARTER.

1092
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,811
IF THE FED CANNOT RAISE INTEREST

1093
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,914
RATES, THEN WHEN CAN THEY RAISE

1094
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,783
INTEREST RATES?

1095
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,786
SO TO MY WAY OF THINKING, THEY

1096
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,154
MUST BACK UP WHAT THEY HAVEN'T

1097
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,488
TALKING ABOUT FOR THE PAST FEW

1098
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:39,356
MONTHS ABOUT THE NORMALIZING AND

1099
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,225
TAKING GRADUAL'S THAT'S.

1100
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,125
IF THEY DON'T COME ULTIMATELY,

1101
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:46,196
THE MARKET BUBBLES EVEN MORE.

1102
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,097
CURRENCIES BECOME EVEN MORE

1103
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:50,100
DISTORTED.

1104
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,136
AND IT'S NOT A HEALTHY STAGE FOR

1105
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,039
CAPITAL.

1106
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,142
MIKE: AS THE FED LOST

1107
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:03,580
CREDIBILITY WITH THE MARKETS?

1108
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,314
BILL: THEY HAVE BEGUN THE

1109
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,183
JOURNEY.

1110
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,853
LIKE I SAID, I THINK IT IS TO

1111
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,354
THE ADVANTAGE OF A FINANCIAL

1112
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:12,155
MARKETS AND CERTAINLY BANKS AND

1113
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,256
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO WORK

1114
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:18,361
WITH A POSITIVE YIELD CORE OF --

1115
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:18,829
YIELD CURVE.

1116
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:24,334
MARGINS DO BETTER WITH A STEEPER

1117
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:24,701
CURVE.

1118
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,170
I THINK THE FED WANTS TO TALK UP

1119
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:32,476
SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.

1120
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,310
ULTIMATELY, THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW

1121
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:33,910
THROUGH OR THEY LOSE

1122
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,513
CREDIBILITY.

1123
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:41,785
TOM: A VERY BALANCED REPORT, NOT

1124
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:42,519
THE HYSTERIA THAT WE SEE IN

1125
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,620
OTHER REPORTS.

1126
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,288
HE SAYS A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY

1127
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:48,358
NEGATIVE REVISIONS IS NOT A SIGN

1128
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,561
OF LABOR MARKET HEALTH.

1129
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:55,966
ONE OF HIS INSIGHTS THIS MONEY.

1130
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:56,633
MICHAEL AND HE IS ALSO

1131
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:57,300
SUGGESTING YOU THROW UP A

1132
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,802
NUMBER.

1133
00:48:58,802 --> 00:48:59,703
PAYROLLS GO HAYWIRE ON OCCASION.

1134
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,739
I'M WONDERING IF THE FED NEEDS

1135
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:06,276
TO SAY SOMETHING HERE TO

1136
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:10,747
REASSURE PEOPLE, TO GIVE FORWARD

1137
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:11,515
GUIDANCE TO PEOPLE, THAT THEY

1138
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:14,618
ARE STILL ON TRACK, SO THAT THEY

1139
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,253
DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE BEING

1140
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:16,920
PUSHED AROUND BY MARKET

1141
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,092
REACTION.

1142
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,095
BILL: YES, I THINK YELLEN CAN

1143
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:25,862
ADDRESS THIS SITUATION NEXT

1144
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:29,199
WEEK.

1145
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:29,966
THE 4.7% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

1146
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:35,973
IT BASICALLY FOLLOWS THE TAIL.

1147
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,976
TO PRODUCE SOME TYPE OF REAL

1148
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:40,710
INTEREST RATE, TO THE EXTENT

1149
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:48,518
THAT IT IS A 4-7 YELLEN.

1150
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,352
TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND

1151
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:50,153
BASICALLY CONTINUE TO SUGGEST A

1152
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,156
HIKE IN JULY.

1153
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,758
AND AN ADDITIONAL ONE IN

1154
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:58,395
DECEMBER.

1155
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,229
TOM: BILL, HOW CAN SHE DO THAT

1156
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:06,603
WITH THE DOLLAR YEN SCREAMING

1157
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,070
EVEN LOUDER.

1158
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:07,804
MY A LOOKING AT GERMAN YIELDS

1159
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:11,308
THAT ARE JAW-DROPPING.

1160
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,876
A TWO-YEAR NEGATIVE YIELD,

1161
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:20,217
NEGATIVE POINTS, 532%, DOESN'T

1162
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:20,951
THAT OVERWHELM ANY RATIONAL

1163
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:21,518
AMERICAN DISCUSSION?

1164
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,621
BILL: NOT EXACTLY.

1165
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,388
BECAUSE IT FITS THE GLOBAL

1166
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:26,122
CENTRAL BANKER AND SETS THE

1167
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:29,359
LEAD.

1168
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,361
THERE IS EVIDENCE AND THERE HAS

1169
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,462
BEEN, AND THERE HAS BEEN, FROM

1170
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,030
EURO LAND, DESPITE THE WONDER WE

1171
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,266
ALL WANT LOWER INTEREST RATES

1172
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:43,240
AND HIGHER BLOSSOMS.

1173
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,074
THESE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES

1174
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:44,841
ARE BEING DESTRUCTIVE IN MANY

1175
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,710
WAYS.

1176
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,577
I THINK IT SOME POINT, THEY HAVE

1177
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:50,413
TO STOP, DESPITE WHAT DRAGHI HAS

1178
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:54,317
SAID ABOUT WHATEVER IT TAKES.

1179
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,453
AND IF HE CONTINUES, I THINK IT

1180
00:50:56,453 --> 00:51:01,992
SOME POINT, THE LOWER AND LOWER

1181
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:02,792
SHORT-TERM RATES ON THE NEGATIVE

1182
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:04,427
SIDE WOULD NOT BE DESTRUCTIVE

1183
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:08,231
FOR A HIMALAYAN TO CRIME --

1184
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:16,439
DECLINE.

1185
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:17,274
TOM: BILL GROSS, THANK YOU VERY

1186
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:17,641
MUCH.

1187
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,808
GENEROUS OF YOU TO TAKE SUCH A

1188
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:22,012
VERY LONG TIME WITH US.

1189
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:26,083
I GO BACK TO THE HEADLINE.

1190
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:26,783
JONATHAN: THANKS TO THE

1191
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:30,420
BLOOMBERG RADIO TEAM.

1192
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,357
A STUNNING JOBS NUMBER, THE

1193
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,992
FEWEST JOBS ADDED IN ALMOST SIX

1194
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:36,359
YEARS.

1195
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,160
HERE'S THE MARKET REACTION.

1196
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:43,633
TWO-YEAR YIELDS PLUMMET, SWITCH

1197
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:49,072
UP THE BOARD, A STRONGER EURO UP

1198
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:49,539
BY 1.3%.

1199
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:53,076
GOLD CATCHES A HUGE BID.

1200
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,045
WE WILL BREAK DOWN THE JOBS

1201
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,847
REPORT 34 MINUTES AWAY.

1202
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:07,237
JONATHAN: A STUNNING U.S. JOBS

1203
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,005
REPORT, THE FEWEST JOBS ADDED TO

1204
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:09,772
THE U.S. ECONOMY AND HIM SIX

1205
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:12,442
YEARS.

1206
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:17,780
HERE'S THE MARKET REACTION.

1207
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,617
TO YEAR YIELD MUCH LOWER.

1208
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,451
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE

1209
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,154
DOLLAR?

1210
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,357
THE EURO-DOLLAR POPS HIGHER,

1211
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,157
MUCH HIGHER, UP BY 1.22% ON THE

1212
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:31,661
SESSION.

1213
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,462
IT IS A MUCH WEAKER DOLLAR

1214
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:37,133
STORY.

1215
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:37,967
THAT IS THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY POP

1216
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:38,468
SINCE MARCH.

1217
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:43,907
BUT GOLD CATCHING A HUGE BID.

1218
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,842
ONE QUESTION FOR THE MARKET --

1219
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,145
IS JUNE REALLY THEY REALIZED

1220
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:53,316
MEETING FOR THE FED?

1221
00:55:53,316 --> 00:56:03,692
♪

1222
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,665
DAVID: 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE

1223
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:12,535
OPENING BELL.

1224
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,138
YOU JUST SAID IT JONATHAN, A

1225
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,573
STUNNING JOBS NUMBER.

1226
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,843
JONATHAN: I WONDER WHO IS

1227
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:20,743
WRITING JANET YELLEN'S SPEECH

1228
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:22,779
FOR MONDAY AND DO THEY JUST DO

1229
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:28,350
THIS?

1230
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,185
DAVID: WE WANT TO GO IMMEDIATELY

1231
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,489
TO ERIK SCHATZKER.

1232
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,222
TAKE US THROUGH IT AGAIN.

1233
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:34,023
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF GOOD NEWS

1234
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,092
IN THERE.

1235
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:36,926
ERIK: AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IT,

1236
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,562
A STUNNING MISS ON JOB CREATION

1237
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,797
FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, JUST

1238
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:45,101
38,000 JOBS CREATED.

1239
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:45,935
THE ECONOMISTS WE SURVEYED WERE

1240
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:46,936
LOOKING FOR 160,000, THE MEDIAN

1241
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,773
ESTIMATE.

1242
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:54,410
AND THE LOWEST ESTIMATE IN OUR

1243
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,078
SURVEY, JUST TO ADD MORE

1244
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,779
GRANULARITY TO IT, WAS 120,000.

1245
00:56:56,779 --> 00:56:58,848
A HUGE MESS.

1246
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,084
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS LITTLE JOB

1247
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,485
CREATION IN AMERICA SINCE

1248
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,989
SEPTEMBER 2010.

1249
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:11,661
THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN TO

1250
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:12,028
4.7%.

1251
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:12,895
BUT THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS

1252
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:13,730
BECAUSE YOU HAD PEOPLE LEAVING

1253
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:20,436
THE LABOR FORCE.

1254
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,471
OVER THE TWO-MONTH PERIOD, YOU

1255
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,305
HAD 800,000 PEOPLE LEAVING THE

1256
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,608
LABOR FORCE.

1257
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,376
AND THAT DOES PUT DOWNWARD

1258
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,077
PRESSURE ON THE UNEMPLOYED RATE.

1259
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,346
AT THE SAME TIME, IT BRINGS THE

1260
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:33,683
PARTICIPATION UP TO 2.6%.

1261
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:34,384
AND THAT IS BACK DOWN TO

1262
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,285
DECEMBER LEVELS.

1263
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,320
WAGE GROWTH IS WHAT THING WE

1264
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,655
HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

1265
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:39,422
THAT SHOULD PORTEND FUTURE

1266
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:39,889
INFLATION.

1267
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:44,294
THAT CAME ON TARGET.

1268
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,429
AVERAGE HOURS WORKED ALSO NOT

1269
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:47,363
REALLY A POSITIVE, TICKING DOWN

1270
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:51,634
TO 34.4 FROM 34.5.

1271
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,336
VERY HARD TO LOOK AT THIS REPORT

1272
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,905
WITH JOB LOSSES IN CONSTRUCTION

1273
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:56,673
AND MINING AND LOGGING, FOR

1274
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:57,474
EXAMPLE.

1275
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,744
AND OF COURSE, THE 34,000 LOSS

1276
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:02,478
IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND

1277
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:04,481
INFORMATION.

1278
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,182
WE BELIEVE THAT IS LARGELY FROM

1279
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,350
THE VERIZON STRIKE.

1280
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,251
IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT THIS

1281
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,486
REPORT AND FIND MUCH THAT IS

1282
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:17,627
POSITIVE, AN AUGER FOR A HIKE IN

1283
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:18,027
JUNE.

1284
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:18,761
DAVID: WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND

1285
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,164
WHO ARE THE LOSERS?

1286
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:21,898
LOOK AT MANUFACTURING AND

1287
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,634
CONSTRUCTION ON THE ONE HAND.

1288
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,903
ERIK: THE ONLY REAL WINNER WAS

1289
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:27,537
HEALTH AND EDUCATION.

1290
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,873
THERE WERE 67,000 JOBS CREATED

1291
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:30,306
THERE.

1292
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,974
I ONLY HAVE FOUR MONTHS OF DATA

1293
00:58:31,974 --> 00:58:32,442
TO GO BY.

1294
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,142
BUT THAT IS 10,000 MORE THAN

1295
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:34,277
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

1296
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,044
SO THAT IS VERY STRONG JOB

1297
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,913
CREATION.

1298
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,448
AGAIN, MANUFACTURING DOWN BY

1299
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,949
10,000.

1300
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,417
MINING AND LOGGING DOWN BY

1301
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:41,885
11,000.

1302
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:46,122
CONSTRUCTION DOWN BY 15,000.

1303
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,023
INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY, DOWN

1304
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,326
BY 34,000.

1305
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,127
I MENTIONED THERE IS A STRONG

1306
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,962
BELIEF OR ANECDOTAL SUGGESTION

1307
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:53,997
EVEN ON THE PART OF THE LABOR

1308
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:56,032
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THE RISE

1309
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:56,499
AND STRIKE.

1310
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:01,871
THE LET'S LOOK AT 34,000 ON TOP

1311
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,241
OF THE 38 THOUSAND.

1312
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,042
WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT ONLY

1313
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,511
72,000 JOBS CREATED.

1314
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:09,212
THAT, TOO, WOULD BE A

1315
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,147
CATASTROPHIC MISS.

1316
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,715
IN MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT, THE

1317
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,383
ECONOMY IS NOT CREATING AS MANY

1318
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:16,052
JOBS AS IT HAS DONE IN THE PAST.

1319
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,722
IT CREATED 29,000 JOBS ON

1320
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,289
AVERAGE IN 2015.

1321
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,758
YES, THAT PACE HAS SLOWED.

1322
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,092
BUT IT HAS ALL FALLEN OFF A

1323
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:24,127
CLIFF IN TERMS OF PACE FOR THIS

1324
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,163
MONTH.

1325
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:29,799
YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE

1326
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:30,600
FODDER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

1327
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,367
THE LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE

1328
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:35,505
AMONG VETERANS IS DOWN THIS

1329
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:35,938
MONTH.

1330
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:38,575
IT IS DOWN TO 50.4% FROM 50.7%.

1331
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,408
THAT IMPORTANTLY, IT IS DOWN BY

1332
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:43,412
MORE FOR GROWTH -- GULF WAR TO

1333
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:46,349
VETERANS.

1334
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,985
YOU CAN SAY THAT IS AN ANGRY

1335
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,586
GROUP OF PEOPLE IF THEY CAN FIND

1336
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:50,953
JOBS.

1337
00:59:50,953 --> 00:59:51,554
AND YOU ALSO SEE THE

1338
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,356
PARTICIPATION RATE JOB PAYING

1339
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:58,127
FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A

1340
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:58,928
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR COLLEGE

1341
00:59:58,928 --> 00:59:59,328
DEGREE.

1342
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:00,697
DAVID COHEN THANK YOU.

1343
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,430
JONATHAN: LOOK AT FEDERAL

1344
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,201
RESERVE EXPECTATION.

1345
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,769
THE POSSIBILITY OF A MOVE.

1346
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,638
CURRENT IMPLIED PROBABILITY.

1347
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,741
THIS IS FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE.

1348
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,275
WE ARE AT 6%.

1349
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,679
WE WERE TRADING IN THE 30'S

1350
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:17,380
APPROACHING THAT NUMBER.

1351
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,650
A REAL CALIBRATION OF

1352
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,150
EXPECTATIONS.

1353
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,586
JULY IS STILL HANGING IN THERE.

1354
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,990
A STUNNING REVERSAL IN

1355
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,591
EXPECTATIONS FOR A SUMMER MOVE

1356
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,594
FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

1357
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:35,731
JEFF RIFKIN STILL WITH US.

1358
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:40,069
JEFF ROSENBERG JOINS US.

1359
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,738
JEFF, EVERY YEAR, YIELDS MUST GO

1360
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:43,973
HIGHER.

1361
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:48,311
GUESS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW.

1362
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,145
JEFF: YEARS OF EXPECTING YIELDS

1363
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:49,946
GOING HIGHER, WE HAVE LEARNED

1364
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:53,115
OUR LESSONS AND WE ARE GOING TO

1365
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:53,816
BE IN A LOW INTEREST RATE

1366
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,450
ENVIRONMENT FOR A WHILE.

1367
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:58,020
BUT ME TALK FOR A SECOND ON THE

1368
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,055
REACTION.

1369
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:03,126
I TAKE THIS AS AN OVERREACTION.

1370
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:03,893
THERE ARE A LOT OF SPECIAL

1371
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:04,727
FACTORS HERE.

1372
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,329
CERTAINLY, IT IS A WEAKER POOR.

1373
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,163
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK

1374
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,833
AND APPRECIATE THAT WE EXPECT

1375
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,467
PAYROLL GROWTH TO SLOW.

1376
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:16,539
WHAT YOU ARE GETTING HERE IS

1377
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,274
OUTSIZED SLOWING IN ONE MONTH

1378
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:19,041
BECAUSE OF THE VERIZON STRIKE,

1379
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:22,679
BECAUSE OF TEMP HELP, BECAUSE OF

1380
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,412
MANUFACTURING, WHICH IS A

1381
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:24,113
WEATHER-RELATED ISSUE.

1382
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,949
LET'S NOT GO TO OVERBOARD ON HOW

1383
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:30,253
WEEK THIS REPORT REALLY IS.

1384
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:33,122
TO YOUR QUESTION, YES, THIS IS

1385
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,423
CERTAINLY BY THE BOND MARKETS

1386
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:35,258
AND PROBABILITIES -- THIS MAKES

1387
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:40,196
IT JUNE -- MAKES JUNE A VERY

1388
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:40,997
HIGH HURDLE FOR THE FED TO GO.

1389
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:41,831
AND THE MARKETS ARE PRICING THAT

1390
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,399
IN.

1391
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,268
WE WILL GET CLAIRE FIXATION ON

1392
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:45,868
THE SPEECH.

1393
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:46,702
BUT IT IS GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

1394
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:51,039
NEXT REPORT.

1395
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:51,874
JONATHAN: MONDAY, JANET YELLEN

1396
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,642
HAS A SPEECH TO MAKE.

1397
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,409
HOW SHOULD SHE COMMUNICATE TO

1398
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:59,481
THE MARKET ON MONDAY?

1399
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:00,249
JEFF: WHAT SHE IS GOING TO

1400
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:01,083
COMMUNICATE IS ABOUT THE LONGER

1401
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:01,751
RUN TRAJECTORY AROUND THE

1402
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:02,418
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LABOR

1403
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:02,818
MARKETS.

1404
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:07,356
NOT ABOUT ONE DATA POINT ON

1405
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,125
FRIDAY, BUT OVER THE LONGER RUN

1406
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:09,959
TRAJECTORY, WHICH INCLUDES THE

1407
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:10,693
FACT THAT THE PACE OF

1408
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:13,863
IMPROVEMENT CAN'T CONTINUE.

1409
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:14,664
NOT BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND SIDE

1410
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:17,767
OF THE ECONOMY.

1411
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:18,534
THE KNEE-JERK REACTION IS THIS

1412
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:19,402
IS A RECESSIONARY SIGNAL BECAUSE

1413
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,636
WE ARE NOT EATING AS MANY JOBS.

1414
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,939
BUT THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE

1415
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,107
JOB MARKET.

1416
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:24,907
ONE IS SUPPLY AND THE OTHERS

1417
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:25,308
DEMAND.

1418
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,910
WE ARE SEEING CONSTRAINTS ON THE

1419
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,012
SUPPLY SIDE.

1420
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:35,551
I THINK SHE CAN EMPHASIZE THAT.

1421
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,385
THE OTHER THING MISSING HERE IS

1422
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:40,022
THAT WE HAVE SEEN WAGE GROWTH.

1423
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,824
AND YOU ARE SEEING THE

1424
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,693
STRENGTHENING IN THE WAGE

1425
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,160
PICTURE.

1426
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,330
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THE

1427
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:52,835
ATLANTA FED WAGE TRACKER, WHICH

1428
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:53,536
IS THE BEST INDICATOR FOR

1429
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,070
TRACKING WE JUST.

1430
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:54,804
BETTER THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING

1431
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,405
IN THAT EA CHIEF.

1432
01:02:56,405 --> 01:03:02,478
SHE WILL HIGHLIGHT THOSE PIECES

1433
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,245
TO MAKE A CASE FOR AN EVENTUAL

1434
01:03:03,245 --> 01:03:04,780
THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN

1435
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,883
NORMALIZATION.

1436
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:11,654
DAVID: THIS ACTUALLY HELPS ARE A

1437
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:12,521
BIT, SAYING WE DID NOT OVERREACT

1438
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:12,989
ON THE UPSIDE.

1439
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,824
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO

1440
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:15,925
OVERREACT ON THE DOWNSIDE.

1441
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,226
JEFF: IT DOES.

1442
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,128
I THINK THEY TRULY WERE GOING TO

1443
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,963
DELAY UNTIL THEY GET THROUGH

1444
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:24,900
BREXIT ANYWAY.

1445
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,069
SHE'S GOT SOMETHING TO TALK

1446
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,705
ABOUT, WAGES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

1447
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,707
COMING DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY -- 

1448
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:32,608
MEGAN: THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE

1449
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:37,279
HAVE LEFT THE LABOR FORCE.

1450
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:39,482
IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF JOB

1451
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,316
INCREASES, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE

1452
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,150
LEAVING.

1453
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,019
JEFF: IF YOU GO BACK 12 YEARS

1454
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:46,956
NOW, MAYBE IT'S 15, WHEN THE

1455
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:47,890
LABOR DEPARTMENT DID A STUDY ON

1456
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,525
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THE

1457
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:50,326
PARTICIPATION RATE, IT HAS DONE

1458
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,294
THAT.

1459
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,696
WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION AND

1460
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,430
THESE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE

1461
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,364
WORKFORCE.

1462
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,633
IT MEANS YOU HAVE A HEIGHT

1463
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:58,401
SITUATION THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE

1464
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,669
OTHERWISE.

1465
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,536
AND IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE

1466
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,271
LEAVING BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL

1467
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,874
DISAPPOINTED.

1468
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:05,708
THEY ARE LEAVING BECAUSE THEY

1469
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:06,208
ARE RETIRING.

1470
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,412
MEGAN: AND WE HAVE DONE A WELL

1471
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:13,849
JOB POINTING OUT THE POSITIVE

1472
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:14,483
POINTS IN THIS REPORT.

1473
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:15,251
BUT 50,000 JOBS LOWER THAN EVEN

1474
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:24,860
THE MOST PESSIMISTIC FORECAST.

1475
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,262
THE HUGE SPLIT WE SEE IN THIS

1476
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,397
ECONOMY BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1477
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:29,298
LOWER EDUCATION LEVELS IN PEOPLE

1478
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,067
WHO HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION

1479
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,968
LEVELS, HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE

1480
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:33,736
THROUGH THAT AND STILL GET A

1481
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:34,370
PICTURE OF A SUSTAINABLE

1482
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,037
RECOVERY AND AN EXPANDING

1483
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,772
RECOVERY?

1484
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,774
THAT IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR HER.

1485
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:39,575
JEFF: IT IS HARD TO DO WITHOUT

1486
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,177
FISCAL HELP.

1487
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,044
WE ARE ASKING THE FED TO DO WITH

1488
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,514
TOO MUCH YEAR.

1489
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:46,282
I LOOK AT THE NONSEASONALLY

1490
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,116
ADJUSTED NUMBERS TO SEE WHAT IS

1491
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:47,884
REALLY GOING ON.

1492
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,986
THIS MONTH, WE ADDED 650,000 NET

1493
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:53,155
JOBS TO THE WORKFORCE.

1494
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:53,923
THAT IS BELOW THE HISTORICAL

1495
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:58,360
NUMBER THAT HAS BEEN AROUND

1496
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:58,794
900,000.

1497
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:01,897
THIS IS GETTING ADJUSTED, SIX

1498
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:02,598
HUNDRED 50,000 IS GETTING

1499
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:03,799
ADJUSTED TO 38,000.

1500
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,902
THAT IS A PRETTY BIG -- I THINK

1501
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,037
WE ARE SEEING A VERY BIG CHANGE

1502
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:08,771
IN THE PATTERN OF HIRING AND

1503
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,207
FIRING.

1504
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,009
AND THESE NUMBERS, FOR PEOPLE TO

1505
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:16,445
BE ADDING THE VERIZON STRIKE TO

1506
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,347
THE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED NUMBER

1507
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,016
MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

1508
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,151
JONATHAN KONG I WANT TO BRING

1509
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:22,952
THE ATTENTION OF OUR VIEWERS ON

1510
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:23,652
WHAT IS HAPPENING THE BOND

1511
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:24,019
MARKET.

1512
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:28,324
TREASURY YIELDS, -11 BASIS

1513
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,026
POINTS.

1514
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,595
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE

1515
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,497
10, WE ARE DOWN NINE BASIS

1516
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,364
POINTS ON THE U.S. 10 YEAR YIELD

1517
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,267
THAT 1.71%.

1518
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:44,740
A RALLY ON BONDS AS WELL.

1519
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,608
JUST SEVEN BASIS POINTS ON YOUR

1520
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,845
YIELD ON THE 10 YEAR.

1521
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:50,613
JEFF ROSENBERG, THIS IS YOUR

1522
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,483
WORLD.

1523
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,285
IT IS A GLOBAL STORY.

1524
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,953
BUT IT IS A U.S. DOMESTIC STORY

1525
01:05:57,953 --> 01:05:59,555
AS WELL.

1526
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,389
EVERY TIME IT TAKES HIGHER, YOU

1527
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,358
GET A DATA POINT LIKE THIS THAT

1528
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,094
PUSHES ALL -- PUSHES US ALL BACK

1529
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,395
AGAIN.

1530
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,897
WILL WE CONTINUE TO BE

1531
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:08,364
WHIPSAWED?

1532
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:12,935
JEFF: YOU BRING UP TWO PARTS TO

1533
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:13,703
THAT.

1534
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:14,470
THIS MORNING AS A DOMESTIC

1535
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,837
STORY.

1536
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:15,638
IT IS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS ON

1537
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,273
THE FED.

1538
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,975
LOOKING ACROSS A GLOBAL YIELDS,

1539
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:21,510
IT IS ABOUT THE GLOBAL STORY IN

1540
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,779
TERMS OF LOW INTEREST RATES.

1541
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:24,613
SO YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT ECB AND

1542
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,315
DRAGHI AND EXPECTATIONS AROUND

1543
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,184
QE.

1544
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,452
AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON THE

1545
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,620
LONG TREND OF GLOBAL INTEREST

1546
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,222
RATE YIELD CURVES IS FOR THE

1547
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,791
PRESSURE DOWNWARD.

1548
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:36,659
WHERE WILL FURTHER EXPANSION AND

1549
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,427
QE COME FROM?

1550
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,597
SO PERSPECTIVE TO THE LONG-TERM

1551
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:42,498
YIELDS IN THE U.S., IT IS A

1552
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,501
GLOBAL STORY.

1553
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,836
THE HIGH-YIELDING INSTRUMENT,

1554
01:06:47,836 --> 01:06:48,604
THESE YIELDS LOOK VERY LOW.

1555
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,406
BUT ON A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,

1556
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,609
THEY ARE ACTUALLY VERY HIGH AND

1557
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:54,443
THAT DRAWS IN GLOBAL INVESTMENTS

1558
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,177
OF THE BACK END OF THE YIELD

1559
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,948
CURVE FOR INVESTORS WHO ARE

1560
01:06:58,948 --> 01:06:59,748
LOOKING FOR PLACES WHERE THEY

1561
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:00,416
CAN GET AWAY FROM NEGATIVE

1562
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:00,916
INTEREST RATES.

1563
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,720
IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, DESPITE THE

1564
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,821
SPEECH THAT JANET YELLEN MAY OR

1565
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:12,528
MAY NOT GIVE, YOU HAD THIS

1566
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,163
BACKDROP THAT COME IN THE REST

1567
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:14,997
OF THE WORLD, WE ARE NOT HAVING

1568
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:16,966
THIS DEBATE OVER NORMALIZATION.

1569
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:19,735
WE ARE HAVING A DIFFERENT

1570
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:20,135
DEBATE.

1571
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:20,869
THE DEBATE ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE

1572
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:26,575
COMMENDATION CAN YOU GET.

1573
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:27,409
DAVID: HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU

1574
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:30,279
CAN NICELY WHAT IS GOING HERE?

1575
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:31,113
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS THE PATH

1576
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,983
WE ARE ON TO SOME EXTENT.

1577
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:34,550
JEFF: ABSOLUTELY.

1578
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,421
YOU CAN'T ISOLATE IT.

1579
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:39,221
WE FOCUS ON ONE THING AT ONE

1580
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:39,588
TIME.

1581
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,156
SO THIS MORNING, IT IS ABOUT THE

1582
01:07:41,156 --> 01:07:41,924
U.S. AND THE FRONT END OF THE

1583
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,125
YIELD CURVE IS RUNNING THE

1584
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:43,492
RALLY.

1585
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:44,260
BUT THE ATTENTIONAL THAT THAT

1586
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:49,164
DELAYS THE'S -- THE GROWTH OF

1587
01:07:49,164 --> 01:07:53,869
THE FED, SO BE IT.

1588
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:54,637
YESTERDAY, IT WAS ABOUT THE

1589
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:55,471
GLOBAL FACTORS PUSHING BACK INTO

1590
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,440
THE U.S..

1591
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:57,940
DAVID: YES.

1592
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,543
THANK YOU.

1593
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,343
THANK YOU FOR STAYING ON WITH

1594
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,412
US.

1595
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,146
BIG NEWS ON JOBS NUMBERS.

1596
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:10,819
WE WILL -- WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO

1597
01:08:10,819 --> 01:08:11,587
TALK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO THE

1598
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,221
JOBS NUMBERS.

1599
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,924
WHAT THEY MEAN, THE IMPACT ON

1600
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:16,692
THE MARKETS AND BE ON MARKETS,

1601
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:17,426
WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN FOR OUR

1602
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:39,515
ECONOMY.

1603
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,870
JONATHAN: A STUNNING JOBS

1605
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,038

1607
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:47,909
NO DRAMA ON THE FUTURES MARKET.

1608
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:51,480
15 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CASH

1609
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:51,814
OPEN.

1610
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,950
HERE IS THE DRAMA.

1611
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,486
TWO-YEAR YIELDS GO LOWER, MUCH

1612
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,623
LOWER, DOWN BY 12 BASIS ONCE TO

1613
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,658
0.77%.

1614
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,993
A REAL CALIBRATION AGAIN OF WHAT

1615
01:11:04,993 --> 01:11:05,761
THE FED MAY OR MAY NOT DO THIS

1616
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,896
SUMMER JUNE IS LIVE IS THE CATCH

1617
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:10,199
PHRASE.

1618
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,033
WE WILL BRING YOU REACTION FROM

01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:11,834

1624
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:29,985
THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY POP SINCE

1625
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:36,358
MARCH.

1626
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,192
SOME BIG MOVES IN THIS MARKET ON

1627
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,061
THE BACK OF THAT VERY

1628
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:39,828
DISAPPOINTING HEADLINE NUMBER,

1629
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:40,362
DAVID.

1630
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:40,996
DAVID: YOU SAID IT.

1631
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,132
IT IS STUNNING.

1632
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,933
WE WILL GET BACK TO THAT JOBS

1633
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,101
NUMBER.

1634
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:51,406
WE ARE JOINED NOW BY STEPHEN

1635

1637
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:57,246
STEPHEN, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM

1638
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:03,485
YOU YET.

1639
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,353
GIVE US YOUR INITIAL REACTION TO

1640
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:04,887
THESE NUMBERS.

1641
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:05,754
STEPHEN: THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY MUCH

1642
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:06,588
WEAKER THAN THE MARKET EXPECTED.

1643
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,790
WITH THE DOWNWARD REVISION,

1644
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,159
MAKING A JUNE HIKE ARE UNLIKELY,

1645
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:11,860
WE KNOW THESE NUMBERS ARE

1646
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,630
ERRATIC.

1647
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:15,364
THE SEASONALITY COULD HAVE

1648
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,065
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, SUMMER

1649
01:12:17,065 --> 01:12:20,302
JOB CREATION.

1650
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:22,871
IN THE PAST, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

1651
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:23,605
HISTORY OF THE DEVIATION OF

1652
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:27,442
ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT FROM 12-MONTH

1653
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:29,611
MOVING AVERAGES, THESE BIG

1654
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,445
SHOCKS, SOMETIMES THEY TELL YOU

1655
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:31,380
THAT THINGS ARE TURNING.

1656
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,583
MOST OF THE TIMES, THEY TELL YOU

1657
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:35,417
IT IS A DATA ERROR.

1658
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,753
BUT IT IS NOT STOPPING THE

1659
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,488
MARKET FROM TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.

1660
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,823
THE MARKET SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT

1661
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:42,791
SURE EUROS.

1662
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:46,061
EQUITIES ARE DOWN.

1663
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:46,862
THE EURO IS THE BIG WINNER ON

1664
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:47,596
THIS.

1665
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:53,902
AND WHEN THE CHIPS FALL ON THE

1666
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,637
EQUITY MARKET, IT IS PROBABLY

1667
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:59,975
NOT THAT POSITIVE FOR E.M..

1668
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:00,909
DAVID: I TAKE YOUR POINT IS ONE

1669
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:01,410
DATA POINT.

1670
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,748
SO HELP US.

1671
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,883
AS POTENTIAL INVESTORS, HELP US

1672
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:08,383
DO THAT.

1673
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:10,919
WHAT DO WE DO NEXT UP WITH THIS

1674
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:11,653
IN PERSPECTIVE AND KNOW THAT

1675
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:12,654
THIS IS REALLY A DOWN TORN -- A

1676
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:17,359
DOWNTURN ARE JUST A BLIP?

1677
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:18,226
STEPHEN: PART OF THE REASON THAT

1678
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:19,027
THE FORECAST WAS SO CONSECRATED

1679
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:25,801
IN THE 140 TO 160 RANGE IS THAT

1680
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:26,568
NONE OF THE USUAL INDICATORS

1681
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:27,369
WERE TELLING YOU THAT THERE WAS

1682
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:33,075
AN IMMINENT COLLAPSE IN

1683
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:33,675
EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITY.

1684
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:34,409
SO YOU WOULD LOOK FOR SOME

1685
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:37,512
CONFIRMATION OR CONTRADICTION

1686
01:13:37,512 --> 01:13:40,315
FROM INITIAL CLAIMS, FROM SOME

1687
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:41,083
OF THESE OTHER INDICATORS THAT

1688
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:41,450
COME IN.

1689
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:47,756
AND OBVIOUSLY, GETTING TWO 38S

1690
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,225
IN A ROW WOULD BE MUCH MORE

1691
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:56,999
MEANINGFUL.

1692
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:57,733
THESE NUMBERS ARE BY NATURE

1693
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:58,533
ERRATIC AND WE TEND TO TAKE THEM

1694
01:13:58,533 --> 01:13:59,334
AS IF THEY ARE GOSPEL, BUT THEY

1695
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,302
ARE NOT.

1696
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,237
JONATHAN: I WAS REMINDED MONTHS

1697
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,539
AGO THAT, IN 2000 FOUR, THE FED

1698
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:05,307
STILL MADE THE MOVE, STILL

1699
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:08,143
HEIGHT INTEREST-RATE.

1700
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,411
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY THIS IS SO

1701
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:10,112
DIFFERENT THIS TIME VERSUS

1702
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:14,349
PREVIOUS FED TIGHTENING CYCLES?

1703
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,251
STEPHEN: I THINK IN 2004, THEY

1704
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:19,488
HAD MORE CONFIDENCE THAT THE

1705
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:20,288
RECOVERY WAS GOING AND INFLATION

1706
01:14:20,288 --> 01:14:20,956
WAS BEGINNING TO PICK UP.

1707
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:26,528
IF YOU LOOK IN -- IF YOU LISTEN

1708
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:27,295
TO THE FED SPEAKERS, THEY WERE

1709
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:28,096
ALREADY CONCERNED ABOUT EUROPEAN

1710
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:28,497
POLITICS.

1711
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:29,297
THERE WERE ENOUGH SPEAKERS TO

1712
01:14:29,297 --> 01:14:31,767
RULE YESTERDAY.

1713
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:32,668
NONE OF THEM ARE IN ANY HURRY TO

1714
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:36,538
HIDE.

1715
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,406
SO WHY HIKE WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A

1716
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:37,873
WEEK NUMBER?

1717
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:38,707
MEGAN: I WANT TO BRING YOU IN ON

1718
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:42,945
THIS.

1719
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:43,712
WHAT IS JANET YELLEN'S

1720
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:44,513
COMMUNICATION STRATEGY GOING TO

1721
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:51,286
BE ON THIS?

1722
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,120
AND HOW IS SHE GOING TO -- AS WE

1723
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:52,888
SAID, SHE IS SPEAKING ON MONDAY

1724
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,655
-- HOW DOES SHE COMMUNICATE HER

1725
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,122
PATH FORWARD?

1726
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:54,856
JEFF: COMMUNICATION HAS ALWAYS

1727
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:55,591
BEEN ABOUT DATA.

1728
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,760
-- DATA DEPENDENCE.

1729
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,528
IF THEY ARE TRAINED TO RAISE

1730
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:01,296
EXPECTATIONS IN THE MARKETS FOR

1731
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,231
THEIR NEXT MOVE, THEY DON'T WANT

1732
01:15:03,231 --> 01:15:07,302
TO SURPRISE THE MARKET.

1733
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,036
THEY WILL HAVE TO CLEARLY

1734
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:08,804
ACKNOWLEDGE THE DISAPPOINTMENT

1735
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:09,337
OF ONE REPORT.

1736
01:15:09,337 --> 01:15:11,606
BUT IT IS EVEN HIGHLIGHTED.

1737
01:15:11,606 --> 01:15:13,842
IT IS ONE REPORT.

1738
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,677
SO I THINK WE WILL PUT THAT

1739
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,813
REPORT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

1740
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:18,647
LONGER-TERM IMPROVEMENT YOU HAVE

1741
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:19,982
SEEN IN THE LABOR MARKETS.

1742
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:20,816
AND PERHAPS THE ADVANTAGE OF

1743
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,451
THAT ILLUSTRATE THE

1744
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,218
DATA-DEPENDENT BUILDING, WHICH

1745
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,488
DOES NOT MEAN ATTENDANCE ON THE

1746
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:29,925
LAST DAY.

1747
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:30,659
MEGAN: WE HAVE TALKED ALL

1748
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,627
MORNING ABOUT JUNE BEING OFF THE

1749
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:33,896
TABLE.

1750
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,965
BUT HOW DO WE GET MORE TO TWO

1751
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:37,432
HIKES?

1752
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:38,433
ARE WE STILL LOOKING AT A LIVE

1753
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,837
JULY?

1754
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,406
JEFF: THE PROBABLY'S HAVE GONE

1755
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:44,773
DOWN.

1756
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:45,540
JONATHAN HIGHLIGHTED IT EARLIER

1757
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:49,211
IN THE PROGRAM.

1758
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,078
YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET TWO HIKES

1759
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:50,946
BECAUSE YOU HAVE JULY.

1760
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:54,983
THE ALSO HAVE SEPTEMBER.

1761
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,752
AND THEN EXPECTATIONS AS YOU

1762
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:57,552
PAUSE AROUND THE ELECTION, YOUR

1763
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:58,954
SECOND HIKE IS IN DECEMBER.

1764
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:06,461
SO I THINK THE TWO SCENARIO HERE

1765
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:06,928
IS LIVE.

1766
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:07,763
WHEN WE GET MORE DATA POINTS FOR

1767
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,364
SEPTEMBER.

1768
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,165
PERHAPS IT PULLS JULY BACK.

1769
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:14,102
BUT WE WILL SEE.

1770
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:18,907
JONATHAN: CITIGROUP WILL NOT

1771
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,008
LIKE ME DOING THIS.

1772
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:20,842
BUT SAY YOU ARE THE FED CHAIR IN

1773
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:23,579
PHILADELPHIA ON MONDAY.

1774
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,379
IT IS EXPECTATIONS FOR A RATE

1775
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:25,614
HIKE.

1776
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:26,381
RARELY HAS IT REVERSED IN A

1777
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,417
MATTER OF MONTHS.

1778
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,419
AND NOW IT IS REVERSING AGAIN.

1779
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,320
WHAT IS YOUR COMMUNICATION

1780
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,691
STRATEGY?

1781
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,424
STEPHEN: I THINK YOU HAVE

1782
01:16:36,424 --> 01:16:39,595
TO LEAVE IT OPEN.

1783
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,395
AS JEFF WAS SAYING, WE HAD SIX

1784
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,298
YEARS WHERE THE EMPLOYMENT

1785
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,267
GROWTH WAS BASICALLY 200,000.

1786
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,404
I THINK YOU WOULD PUT IT INTO

1787
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:53,342
CONTEXT.

1788
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,477
IT COULD SUGGEST THAT THINGS ARE

1789
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:56,745
FALLING APART, BUT IS NOT THE

1790
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:57,546
ONLY THING YOU WILL BE LOOKING

1791
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:57,846
AT.

1792
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:02,784
I THINK JULY IS STILL ALIVE.

1793
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:03,585
RIGHT NOW, FED FUNDS DOES NOT

1794
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:06,622
HAVE A WHOLE HIGH-PRICED IN FOR

1795
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,456
CALENDAR 2016.

1796
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,892
SO THERE IS A LOT OF PESSIMISM

1797
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:11,726
AND THE MARKET AND THAT MIGHT BE

1798
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:12,360
OVERDONE AT THIS STAGE.

1799
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,094
YOU WOULD THINK THAT SHE WOULD

1800
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:20,802
TRY TO HAVE SOME BALANCE.

1801
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,570
JONATHAN: SO JUNE IS DEAD.

1802
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,807
LONG LIVE JULY.

1803
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,643
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

1804
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:32,581
STAY WITH US AS WE COUNT DOWN TO

1805
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:33,582
THE U.S. OPEN 

1806
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,618
♪

1807
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:47,248
MEGAN: WELCOME BACK.

1808
01:19:47,248 --> 01:19:50,185
WE ARE STILL HERE TALKING WITH

1809
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:53,555
JEFF ROSENBAUM, TALKING ABOUT

1810
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:54,289
THIS STUNNING JOBS REPORT WE

1811
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,391
HAVE SEEN.

1812
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,594
WE DO HAVE ONE LITTLE BRIGHT

1813
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:00,395
SPOT, WHICH IS THAT WAGES CAME

1814
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:04,132
IN AT 0.2% UP.

1815
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,500
HOW MUCH ARE WE GOING TO SEE

1816
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:10,071
THOSE WAGES CONTINUE TO RISE?

1817
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:11,606
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE YET TO SEE AN

1818
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:12,240
ACTUAL DATA POINT, BUT

1819
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,008
POTENTIALLY A STALLING OF THAT

1820
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,410
HUGE SURGE IN THE LABOR MARKET?

1821
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,913
JEFF: IT IS A GOOD WAY TO FRAME

1822
01:20:18,913 --> 01:20:19,481
THE CONVERSATION.

1823
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,916
IT IS ONE DATA POINT.

1824
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:21,816
WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH

1825
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:24,285
OUT OF THE ONE DATA POINT WHERE

1826
01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:26,721
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN WAGES FOR

1827
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:27,455
SOME TIME NOW IS A GRADUAL

1828
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:28,623
STRENGTHENING.

1829
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,225
THAT IS TELLING YOU ABOUT THE

1830
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,493
TIMING OF THE LABOR MARKET.

1831
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,894
AND HERE IS AN IMPORTANT POINT.

1832
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,629
YOU CAN HAVE SLOW DOWN IN

1833
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:37,799
HEADLINE PAYROLL GROWTH AND THAT

1834
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:42,370
IS NOT A RECESSIONARY SIGNAL.

1835
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,138
THE POINT IS THAT WE SHOULD

1836
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:48,476
EXPECT A SLOWDOWN GOOD THE LABOR

1837
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:49,144
MARKET IS TIGHTENING.

1838
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:49,911
BUT IT IS TIGHTENING BECAUSE OF

1839
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,213
THE SUPPLY SIDE.

1840
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,013
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY AN

1841
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:56,685
INDICATION OF THE DEMAND SIDE.

1842
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,519
WHAT WAGES OR TELL YOU ABOUT IS

1843
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,253
THE TIGHTNESS OF THE LABOR

1844
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:01,756
MARKET.

1845
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:02,590

01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:05,060

1847
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,761

1862
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:40,362
MINUTES WAY.

1863
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:42,897
I'VE GOT TO SAY THOUGH, NO MORE

1864
01:21:42,897 --> 01:21:43,665

JONATHAN: THIS IS BLOOMBERG GO.

1871

01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:14,676

SWITCH UP THE BOARD.

1880
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,691
IT IS THE EURO, A MUCH STRONGER

1881
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:30,625
EURO.

1882
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:34,896
THERE IT IS, UP 1.4% ON THE

1883
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:35,864

1884
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:36,631

01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:52,347
CRUDE IS DOING ITS THING, A

1890
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:53,114
LITTLE SOFTER.

1891
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:55,083
LET'S GET THESE MARKETS OPEN.

1892
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,252
25 SECONDS INTO THE SESSION.

1893
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:58,052
LET'S GO BACK TO ABIGAIL

1894
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:01,156
DOOLITTLE.

1895
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:01,956
ABIGAIL: WE ARE LOOKING AT A

1896
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:03,858
WEAKER OPEN FOR U.S. STOCKS

1897
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:07,662
AFTER THAT TAKES MAINLY BAD

1898
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:11,399
PAYROLL, THE WORST IN SIX YEARS.

1899
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:12,233
A LITTLE BIT OF A RECOVERY OFF

1900
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:14,035
OF THE PREMARKET LOWS.

1901
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:16,838
THE S&P FUTURES, WE DO SEE A

1902
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:20,842
SHARP DROP-OFF AFTER -- RIGHT

1903
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,043
HERE.

1904
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:25,146
WE SEE THIS AFTER THE NONFARM

1905
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,248
PAYROLLS WAS ANNOUNCED.

1906
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:28,082
THE QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER WE

1907
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:30,818
SEE A RECOVERY AS THE DAY MOVES

1908
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:33,154
ON AS INVESTORS START TO PRICE

1909
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,655
IN THE POSSIBILITY OF A

1910
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:37,125
RIGHT-DELAY.

1911
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,860
THE POSSIBILITY OF A DELAY, THE

1912
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:43,131
FINANCIALS OF ALL THE BIG BANKS,

1913
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:43,898
WELLS FARGO AND JPMORGAN DOWN

1914
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:47,302
SHARPLY.

1915
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:48,102
THEY MAKE MONEY ON LENDING.

1916
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:52,073
WE HAVE THE SHARES OF UNION

1917
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:54,275
PACIFIC TRADING HIGHER HERE ON

1918
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:57,078
MARKET OPEN.

1919
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:01,182
GOLDMAN WAS RAISED TO A BUY.

1920
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,652
A 20% UPSIDE POTENTIAL FOR DEERE

1921
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:05,153
.

1922
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:08,156
UNION PACIFIC WAS UPGRADED TO AN

1923
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:09,357
OVERWEIGHT.

1924
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,125
HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.

1925
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:15,463
MEGAN: WE TURN NOW TO WALMART,

1926
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:17,432
THE COMPANIES -- COUNTRY'S

1927
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,701
BIGGEST RABBIT EMPLOYER.

1928
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:20,435
IT IS HOLDING A SHAREHOLDER

1929
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:23,638
MEETING IN ARKANSAS.

1930
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:24,505
SHANNON, WALMART HAS BEEN ONE OF

1931
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,341
THE COMPANIES THAT HAS FIVE

1932
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,942
PUBLIC BATTLES WITH EMPLOYEES

1933
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:31,145
OVER WAGES, WHAT PRICE THEY

1934
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:33,248
SHOULD PUT THEM AT.

1935
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,516
WITH A $50 MINIMUM TRYING TO BE

1936
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:36,284
PUSHED THROUGH.

1937
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:38,753
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS

1938
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:39,487
BATTLE WILL BE TALKED ABOUT

1939
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:39,821
TODAY?

1940
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:43,724
>> THE COMPANY IS VERY PROUD OF

1941
01:27:43,724 --> 01:27:46,361
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON WAGES.

1942
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,663
THEY SAY THAT IS HELPING IMPROVE

1943
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:49,464
THE QUALITY OF THEIR STORES AND

1944
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:49,997
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

1945
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:50,731
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CEO HAS

1946
01:27:50,731 --> 01:27:53,401
BEEN TOUTING AND SAYING HE HAS

1947
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:54,302
SEEN THE BENEFITS OF INCREASED

1948
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:55,570
WAGERS.

1949
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:59,207
THERE IS A FLIPSIDE OF WHEN

1950
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,241
WAGES GO UP FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES,

1951
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:03,878
THAT MEANS PEOPLE HAVE MORE

1952
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:04,712
MONEY IN THEIR POCKET THAT THEY

1953
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:05,647
CAN SPEND.

1954
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:07,248
WAGES, EVEN IF THEY GO UP, THAT

1955
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,617
CAN BE A POSITIVE THING FOR

1956
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:10,051
WALMART.

1957
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:14,288
MEGAN: WE HAVE SEEN A STUNNING

1958
01:28:14,288 --> 01:28:15,757
JOBS REPORT WITH ONLY 38,000

1959
01:28:15,757 --> 01:28:18,759
PEOPLE ADDED TO THE WORKFORCE,

1960
01:28:18,759 --> 01:28:19,861
THE LOWEST NUMBER IN SIX YEARS.

1961
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:24,732
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WALMART, HOW

1962
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:25,466
DIFFICULT DO THINK IT IS FOR

1963
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,234
THEM TO CONTINUE TO REFRESH

1964
01:28:26,234 --> 01:28:26,801
THEIR OWN WORKFORCE?

1965
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:30,972
>> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING

1966
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,974
BECAUSE AS THE LABOR MARKET

1967
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,042
TIGHTENED, A LOT OF EMPLOYERS AT

1968
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:35,810
THE LOWER END OF THE PAY SCALE

1969
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:39,814
HAD DIFFICULTY RECRUITING.

1970
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:40,915
AS THE MARKET TIGHTENS, A WILL

1971
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:43,051
GET EASIER FOR THEM TO HIRE

1972
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:46,354
PEOPLE AT THE LOWER WAGE AND.

1973
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,221
THERE IS AN INTERESTING FLIPSIDE

1974
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:50,258
TO THIS NEGATIVE JOBS NUMBER FOR

1975
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:51,259
WALMART.

1976
01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:53,061
IT NEVER LOOKS GOOD FOR A

1977
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,363
COMPANY WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT OF

1978
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,097
WORK AND HAVE LESS MONEY IN

1979
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,099
THEIR POCKET, BUT WALMART HAS

1980
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:59,100
HISTORICALLY DONE WELL IN A DOWN

1981
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,035
MARKET.

1982
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:03,337
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THEIR STOCK

1983
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:04,205
DID WELL WHEN THERE WERE ALL OF

1984
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:07,508
THESE JITTERS.

1985
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,309
THEIR STOCK IS NOT DOWN THAT

1986
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:10,044
MUCH TODAY.

1987
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:12,947
COMPANY -- AS PEOPLE SEE WAGES

1988
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,115
GO DOWN, THEY TRADE DOWN.

1989
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:17,151
THEY LOOK FOR RETAILERS LIKE

1990
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,153
WALMART, DOLLAR GENERAL, RATHER

1991
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:23,191
THAN TARGET, NORDSTROM.

1992
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,093
MEGAN: MAYBE GOOD FOR WALMART.

1993
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:30,564
THANK YOU.

1994
01:29:30,564 --> 01:29:34,535
DAVID: WE ARE GOING TO TURN BACK

1995
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:35,136
TO THIS JOBS REPORT.

1996
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:37,405
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

1997
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:40,141
WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS A

1998
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:40,808
LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AGO.

1999
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:45,646
WE WERE VERY SURPRISED.

2000
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:46,614
WE DID NOT EXPECT THIS NUMBER.

2001
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:47,481
WHERE U.S. SURPRISED AS WE WORK?

2002
01:29:47,481 --> 01:29:52,219
>> THIS IS BELOW EXPECTATIONS.

2003
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:55,256
I EXPECTED THERE WOULD BE IMPACT

2004
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:56,424
FROM THE VERIZON STRIKE.

2005
01:29:56,424 --> 01:30:00,394
THAT IS WHY I CALLED THEM TO OR

2006
01:30:00,394 --> 01:30:01,195
THREE WEEKS AGO AND SAID WE NEED

2007
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:01,762
TO RESOLVE THIS.

2008
01:30:01,762 --> 01:30:05,032
YOUR WORKERS AND FAMILIES ARE

2009
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:05,733
SUFFERING, THE COMPANY

2010
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:06,400
SUFFERING, THE ECONOMY IS

2011
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,936
SUFFERING.

2012
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:09,737
A BIG PART OF WHAT WE SAW IN

2013
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:10,504
THIS REPORT WAS THE IMPACT OF

2014
01:30:10,504 --> 01:30:11,439
THAT STRIKE.

2015
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,107
I EXPECT TO SEE THAT RECOVERY IN

2016
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:14,375
THE FOLLOWING MONTHS.

2017
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:18,613
DAVID: FAIR POINT.

2018
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:20,314
BUT THAT IS ABOUT 35,000 JOBS.

2019
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:23,584
THE EXPECTATION WAS FOR AS MANY

2020
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:24,786
AS 160,000.

2021
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,721
IF YOU TAKE THAT OUT, YOU ARE

2022
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:27,321
STILL WAY SHORT.

2023
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:32,026
>> THAT IS THE DIRECT IMPACT.

2024
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:32,793
THAT WAS THE ESTIMATE OF THE

2025
01:30:32,793 --> 01:30:33,327
DIRECT IMPACT.

2026
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:36,464
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

2027
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:37,198
MULTIPLIER EFFECT IS, OTHER

2028
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:38,599
BUSINESSES THAT GET IMPACTED BY

2029
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:38,966
THIS.

2030
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:41,769
AT THE SAME TIME, THE REPORT WAS

2031
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,670
BELOW EXPECTATIONS.

2032
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:45,673
I LOOK AT THE BROADER PICTURE.

2033
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:48,743
WE HAVE HAD ROUGHLY EIGHT

2034
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:50,511
REPORTS SINCE THE RECOVERY WHERE

2035
01:30:50,511 --> 01:30:52,780
WE WERE UNDER 100,000.

2036
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,715
YOU LOOK AT ONE MONTH AND IT

2037
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:56,717
DOES NOT MAKE A TREND.

2038
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:58,853
WHAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO IS

2039
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:00,087
LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE.

2040
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:00,888
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, WE

2041
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:03,457
HAVE SEEN ABOUT 100 60,000 JOBS

2042
01:31:03,457 --> 01:31:05,860
A YEAR.

2043
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,829
THAT IS AN APPLE LEVEL OF JOBS

2044
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:13,968
-- AN AMPLE NUMBER OF JOBS.

2045
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:15,836
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS A

2046
01:31:15,836 --> 01:31:16,637
TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF

2047
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:17,939
JOBS AND WAGE GROWTH.

2048
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:20,708
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AVERAGE WAGE

2049
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,677
GROWTH RIGHT NOW, IT IS 2.3%

2050
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:23,911
ANNUALIZED.

2051
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:26,881
WE ARE SEEING WAGE GROWTH.

2052
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:29,951
THAT IS A GOOD SIGN.

2053
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:32,319
THEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER

2054
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:33,821
BELLWETHERS, AND YOU DON'T JUST

2055
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:36,357
LOOK AT ONE DATA POINT.

2056
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:37,024
FIRST-TIME CLAIMS FOR

2057
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:39,860
UNEMPLOYMENT, THOSE ARE AT

2058
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,528
HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS.

2059
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:43,898
WE HAVE 65 WEEKS BELOW 300,000.

2060
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:46,801
WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT SINCE 1973.

2061
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:50,971
AUTO SALES, LOOK AT CONSUMER

2062
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:54,442
SPENDING, THOSE THINGS ARE UP.

2063
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:55,276
WHEN I LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF

2064
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,812
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WAS THIS

2065
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:00,314
REPORT BELOW EXPECTATIONS?

2066
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:00,815
YES IT WAS.

2067
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:02,683
IS THE VERIZON STRIKE PART OF

2068
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:05,353
IT?

2069
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,287
ABSOLUTELY.

2070
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:08,389
DO WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO?

2071
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,491
ABSOLUTELY.

2072
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:11,225
THAT IS WHY WE ADVOCATE FOR

2073
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:14,161
THINGS LIKE WAGING THE MINIMUM

2074
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:14,528
WAGE.

2075
01:32:14,528 --> 01:32:16,030
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING,

2076
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,098
BECAUSE WE HAD AN INFRASTRUCTURE

2077
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:19,467
BILL LAST FALL, BUT WE NEED TO

2078
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:20,535
DO MORE.

2079
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,570
THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO.

2080
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,873
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIGGER

2081
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:26,707
PICTURE, THERE ARE REALLY SOUND

2082
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:27,274
FUNDAMENTALS HERE.

2083
01:32:27,274 --> 01:32:30,644
JONATHAN: THERE IS A WORD IN THE

2084
01:32:30,644 --> 01:32:31,445
U.K. THAT IS USED A LOT, IT IS

2085
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:31,779
SPIN.

2086
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:34,582
I'M HEARING SPIN HERE.

2087
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:37,451
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS TREND, WE

2088
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:39,587
JUST HAD AN UGLY 38,000.

2089
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:41,188
I TAKE YOUR POINT ON WAGES.

2090
01:32:41,188 --> 01:32:44,825
THIS IS A SOFT REPORT.

2091
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,861
THE LAST ONE WAS SOFT, TOO.

2092
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:47,728
WHAT IS THE TREND, THREE MONTHS,

2093
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:48,529
SIX MONTHS?

2094
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:53,668
>> 65 WEEKS IN A ROW UNDER

2095
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:58,639
300,000 FIRST-TIME CLAIMS FOR

2096
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,140
UNEMPLOYMENT.

2097
01:32:59,140 --> 01:32:59,673
THAT IS A TREND.

2098
01:32:59,673 --> 01:33:02,309
75 MONTHS IN A ROW OF

2099
01:33:02,309 --> 01:33:03,144
PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH, THAT

2100
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:03,644
IS A TREND.

2101
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:06,714
AUTO SALES CONTINUING TO BE AT

2102
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:07,715
RECORD LEVELS.

2103
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:09,416
LAST YEAR WAS THE BEST YEAR

2104
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:09,817
EVER.

2105
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:12,987
THAT IS A TREND.

2106
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:14,755
WE SEE A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING

2107
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,125
HERE THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT WE

2108
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:18,793
ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT

2109
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:19,226
DIRECTION.

2110
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:20,895
WE HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

2111
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:22,563
THERE IS NOBODY HERE SPIKING THE

2112
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,532
FOOTBALL, PUTTING UP MISSION

2113
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:25,900
ACCOMPLISHED SENSE, WE HAVE MORE

2114
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:29,003
WORK TO DO.

2115
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:33,507
THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE TOP OF

2116
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:34,341
THE MONTH, AND THIS IS TRUE IN

2117
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:35,075
EVERY RECOVERY, THE SMALLER

2118
01:33:35,075 --> 01:33:35,743
STEPS YOU WILL TAKE IN JOB

2119
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:37,378
GROWTH.

2120
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:38,212
LOOK AT PRIOR RECOVERIES, WE SAW

2121
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:41,515
THAT.

2122
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:42,349
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU WILL START

2123
01:33:42,349 --> 01:33:43,317
TO SEE WAGE GROWTH.

2124
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:44,185
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE.

2125
01:33:44,185 --> 01:33:46,954
THOSE ARE THE TRADE-OFFS YOU

2126
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:48,689
HAVE WHEN YOU ARE GETTING

2127
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:52,927
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RECOVERY AT

2128
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:53,761
THIS STAGE WE ARE CURRENTLY AT.

2129
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:55,196
JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT

2130
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,131
PREVIOUS RECOVERY.

2131
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,732
2.5% IS A DROP IN THE OCEAN

2132
01:33:58,732 --> 01:34:01,669
CONSIDERING WHERE WE WERE WITH

2133
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:05,906
WAGE GROWTH IN PREVIOUS

2134
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:06,407
RECOVERIES.

2135
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:08,376
IMPLEMENT AT 4.7%.

2136
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:09,210
YOU TALK ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN AND

2137
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:12,780
HOW WE ARE CREEPING TO THE TOP.

2138
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:13,547
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING

2139
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:14,281
ABOUT FALLING DOWN THE OTHER

2140
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:15,583
SIDE.

2141
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:16,350
I WONDER IF THIS ECONOMY HAS

2142
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:17,151
LOST MOMENTUM.

2143
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:18,986
THE TREND SEEMS TO BE POPPING

2144
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,187
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

2145
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:21,856
ARE WE LOOKING AT A ECONOMY THAT

2146
01:34:21,856 --> 01:34:23,124
LOST MOMENTUM?

2147
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:27,061
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

2148
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:29,430
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

2149
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,231
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, WE

2150
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:33,167
HAVE 150,000 JOBS A MONTH.

2151
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:35,236
WE NEED ABOUT 175,000 JOBS A

2152
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:37,037
MONTH TO SUSTAIN THE CURRENT

2153
01:34:37,037 --> 01:34:41,808
LEVEL.

2154
01:34:41,808 --> 01:34:43,310
YOU LOOK AT FIRST-TIME CLAIMS

2155
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:46,447
FOR UNEMPLOYMENT, SO THAT IS ONE

2156
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:49,283
OF THE MOST RELIABLE PREDICTORS.

2157
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:52,152
WE HAVE 5.8 MILLION JOB OPENINGS

2158
01:34:52,152 --> 01:34:54,455
RIGHT NOW.

2159
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:57,692
IN THE RECESSION, THERE WERE

2160
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:58,459
SEVEN JOBSEEKERS FOR EVERY

2161
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,194
OPENING, NOW WE HAVE 1.4 SEEKERS

2162
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:04,999
FOR EVERY OPENING.

2163
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:05,833
WE NEED TO WORK ON LABOR FORCE

2164
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:06,333
PARTICIPATION.

2165
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,435
THE IRONY OF THOSE WHO CRITICIZE

2166
01:35:08,435 --> 01:35:12,273
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE

2167
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:13,040
ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE

2168
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,776
EFFORTS TO PUT IN PLACE 21ST

2169
01:35:15,776 --> 01:35:18,946
CENTURY PAY POLICIES.

2170
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:19,713
WE KNOW HOW WE CAN INCREASE

2171
01:35:19,713 --> 01:35:22,016
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, THAT

2172
01:35:22,016 --> 01:35:22,783
IS DOING WHAT THE REST OF THE

2173
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:23,217
WORLD DOES.

2174
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:26,787
HAVING A SENSIBLE FEDERAL PAY

2175
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:27,988
FREEZE POLICY SO WE WOULD BE

2176
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:29,824
LIKE CANADA AND GERMANY AND

2177
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:32,459
OTHER COUNTRIES WHOSE FEMALE

2178
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:33,394
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE

2179
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,863
ARE HIGHER THAN OURS BECAUSE

2180
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:36,597
THEIR PUBLIC POLICY REFLECTS

2181
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:37,064
THIS.

2182
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:40,201
WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

2183
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:40,901
FOLKS IN THE REPUBLICAN

2184
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:44,571
LEADERSHIP DON'T WANT TO WAGE --

2185
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:45,239
RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE.

2186
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:48,976
MEGAN: YOU SAID NO ONE IS

2187
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:49,643
SPIKING THE FOOTBALL.

2188
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:52,546
THIS WEEK WE SAW THE PRESIDENT

2189
01:35:52,546 --> 01:35:56,083
TOUTS HIS ECONOMIC RECORD OF THE

2190
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:56,583
MINISTRATION.

2191
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:58,919
TWO DAYS LATER, WE SEE A LABOR

2192
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:01,922
MARKET REPORT THAT INDICATES

2193
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:08,462
SEVERE WEAKNESS ACROSS SEVERAL

2194
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:09,129
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY.

2195
01:36:09,129 --> 01:36:09,897
HOW DO YOU ESCAPE THE FACT THAT

2196
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:10,664
IT SEEMS LIKE MOMENTUM AND RISK

2197
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:11,231
IS TO THE DOWNSIDE?

2198
01:36:11,231 --> 01:36:11,999
>> EVERY MONTH, IT IS FUNNY, I

2199
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:12,366
RECALL.

2200
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:13,801
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IS TALK

2201
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:17,037
ABOUT WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE TOOK

2202
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:18,038
OFFICE.

2203
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:21,041
WE WERE LOSING 2.4 MILLION JOBS

2204
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,310
IN THE MONTHS BEFORE HE TOOK

2205
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:23,744

2208
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:31,385
WE HAVE SEEN THE AUTO INDUSTRY.

2209
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:34,688

2214
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:43,397
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

2224
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,611
I WANT TO WRAP THIS UP.

2225
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:58,479
IF THE TREND AND THE MOMENTUM IS

2226
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,014
SO GOOD, WHY HAS THE FED ONLY

2227
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:02,249
BEEN ABLE TO HIKE RATES ONCE?

2228
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:05,085

EVERY TIME I GET ASKED THAT,

2231
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:14,361
I'VE LEAVE THAT TO THE FED.

2232
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:19,800
WE CONTACTED THE VERIZON STRIKE

2233
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,634

2235
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:25,172
WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR

SPENDING, THESE ARE THE THINGS

2241
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:35,115
THAT WILL CREATE MORE JOBS AND

2242

PUT MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS.

2243
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:37,651
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MONEY IN THEIR

2244
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:40,754
POCKETS, THEY SPEND IT.

2245
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:42,022
THAT HELPS THE ECONOMY.

2246
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:42,856
WHAT I HEAR FROM BUSINESSES ALL

2247
01:37:42,856 --> 01:37:48,328
THE TIME, THEY SAY THEY NEED

2248
01:37:48,328 --> 01:37:49,063
MORE CUSTOMERS.

2249
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:49,830
ONE OF THE BEST WAY TO GET

2250
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:51,732
CUSTOMERS IS TO PUT MONEY IN

2251
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:52,833
PEOPLE'S POCKETS.

TOOK A BIG STEP TOWARDS JULY.

2296
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,340
I THOUGHT JUNE WAS TOO SOON.

2297
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:54,207
THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN

01:41:54,207 --> 01:41:56,210
THE ECONOMY.

2299
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:57,044
THE WEAKNESS IN THIS REPORT, WE

ALWAYS SAY ONE MONTH IS NOT A

2301
01:42:00,347 --> 01:42:01,181

01:42:08,255 --> 01:42:10,757
WE SEE A PRONOUNCED DECELERATION

2307
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:13,727
IN THE LABOR MARKET THAT

2308

IF WE WERE A MATURE A COMMIE,

2321
01:42:38,919 --> 01:42:40,954

NONFARM PAYROLL.

2348
01:43:25,065 --> 01:43:25,799

2350
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:30,604
THE WHITE LINE IS AVERAGE HOURLY

EARNINGS GROWTH.

2352
01:43:31,204 --> 01:43:33,407
WHAT WE CAN SEE IN THOSE CIRCLE

2353
01:43:33,407 --> 01:43:34,841

2354
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:37,344

2356
01:43:42,849 --> 01:43:43,951

2360
01:43:51,491 --> 01:43:54,861
MODERATED OR DOWNSHIFTED TO WE

01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:48,782
DEFENDS A MIDYEAR HIKE IN JULY,

2391
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:50,016

2392
01:44:50,016 --> 01:44:50,383

2393

2394
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:58,024

2395
01:44:58,024 --> 01:45:01,528
JONATHAN: THE PAYROLL REPORT

2396
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:02,529
CAME OUT JUST OVER AN HOUR AGO.

2397
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:05,932
THE HEADLINE NUMBER COMES IN AT

2398
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:06,333
38,000.

2399
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:10,437
WE WERE EXPECTING 160,000.

2400
01:45:10,437 --> 01:45:14,341
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS ESTIMATED

2401
01:45:14,341 --> 01:45:18,612
AT 4.9%, WE CAME IN AT 4.7%.

2402
01:45:18,612 --> 01:45:22,983
AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS 2.5%.

2403
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:23,750
WE ARE 20 MINUTES INTO THE

2404
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:28,254
SESSION.

2405
01:45:28,254 --> 01:45:29,089
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, MUCH

2406
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:31,458
LOWER IN MAINLAND EUROPE WITH

2407
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:34,895
THE DAX DOWN BY 1%.

2408
01:45:34,895 --> 01:45:35,696
A MUCH STRONGER EURO.

2409
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:42,669
EURO-DOLLAR AT 11315.

2410
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:46,807
YIELDS LOWER.

2411
01:45:46,807 --> 01:45:49,276
MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD BE,

2412
01:45:49,276 --> 01:45:51,678
ABOUT A MONTH AGO EVERYONE WAS

2413
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:53,847
SAYING THE FED WILL DO NOTHING

2414
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:54,314
THIS SUMMER.

2415
01:45:54,314 --> 01:45:56,816
THEN EVERYONE SAID THE FED WILL

2416
01:45:56,816 --> 01:45:59,252
DO EVERYTHING THIS SUMMER.

2417
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:00,053
ONE DATA POINT, THEY WILL DO

2418
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:00,654
NOTHING THIS SUMMER.

2419
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:02,389
TALK ME THROUGH THIS

2420
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:04,424
OVERREACTION TO THE DOWNSIDE AND

2421
01:46:04,424 --> 01:46:04,891
THE UPSIDE.

2422
01:46:04,891 --> 01:46:07,761
JEFF: THERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT

2423
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:13,233
OF SHORT-TERMISM.

2424
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:14,000
MARKETS ARE AFFECTED BY THE

2425
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,268
MOMENT.

2426
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:16,136
TODAY'S MOVE IS WHAT YOU ARE

2427
01:46:16,136 --> 01:46:17,137
SEEING.

2428
01:46:17,137 --> 01:46:20,374
IN TERMS OF SHIFTING BACK AND

2429
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,241
FORTH, THE FED DID NOT WANT TO

2430
01:46:21,241 --> 01:46:22,042
HAVE ZERO PROBABILITY OF A HIKE.

2431
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:23,877
THAT IS WHAT THE MARKET HAS

2432
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:25,011
PRICED IN.

2433
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:29,049
THE DEBATE WAS ALWAYS JUNE,

2434
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,685
JULY, TODAY AND THIS MORNING IS

2435
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,286
ABOUT PUSHING OFF JUNE.

2436
01:46:33,286 --> 01:46:34,154
THE JUNE PAYROLL REPORT WE GET

2437
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:36,623
NEXT MONTH, IT WILL TAKE ON

2438
01:46:36,623 --> 01:46:37,691
HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE BECAUSE

2439
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:40,160
TWO POINTS DETERMINE A LINE.

2440
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:43,863
RIGHT NOW WE CAN SAY THIS IS A

2441
01:46:43,863 --> 01:46:44,664
ONE-OFF, IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE

2442
01:46:44,664 --> 01:46:47,501
LONGER-TERM TRAJECTORY.

2443
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:48,368
THE NEXT REPORT MIGHT HAVE THAT

2444
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:48,802
EFFECT.

2445
01:46:48,802 --> 01:46:49,936
THAT WILL TAKE ON GREATER

2446
01:46:49,936 --> 01:46:50,403
IMPORTANCE.

2447
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:54,908

2453
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:18,885
DAVID: THIS IS BLOOMBERG GO.

2454
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:19,719
WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A BIG

2455
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:20,520
DAY BECAUSE OF THE PAYROLL.

2456
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,088
WE DID NOT KNOW IT WOULD BE THIS

2457
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:23,390
BIG OF A DAY.

2458
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,125
THE SHOCKING NUMBER, 38,000.

2459
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:28,428

SHOCK TO DELAY JUNE AND JULY FOR

SURE.

2465

2467
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,342
YEAR IS IN THE CARDS I THINK

2468
01:49:42,342 --> 01:49:45,612
THEY WANT TO NORMALIZE THE YIELD

2469
01:49:45,612 --> 01:49:48,515

2470
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:50,183

WE HAVE DROPPED LOW 5% FOR THE

01:50:11,905 --> 01:50:15,175
MONTHS OF JUNE.

2483
01:50:15,175 --> 01:50:17,344
THIS IS REMARKABLE.

01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:24,584
WE WERE AT THE 30S.

HAVE IS WHY IT IS AN OUTLIER.

2507
01:51:05,258 --> 01:51:06,125
WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT IT

2508
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:08,495
WILL BE AN ABERRATION?

2509
