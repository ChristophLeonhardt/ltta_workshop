important car for Ferrari it's the return of turbo charging they haven't really had turbocharged cars since the 80s there was a model called the f40 that was the last turbocharged machine they had they're moving away from the naturally aspirated v8 so the turbo v8 so you know I've driven a number of Ferraris and the first thing you always have to deal with when you get into one of these cars is you've got to get used to its personality a little bit Ferraris are very idiosyncratic there they're extremely sexy fun exhilarating cars to drive but it does take you a second to get used to the feel of the car third you can already hear it's making these all burbling burping Oh it's a little more subdued than the four or five eight I can tell that already it's definitely got more of a it's got a little bit more of a low-key personality I wouldn't go with steering it's kind of in the middle of be it's not super light and it's not super heavy it's kind of its kind of nicely positioned in the middle we're probably all of you know five or six inches off the roadway now down here in our in our tub of exquisitely crafted carbon fiber and you would think oh the car is going to get the cards and I'm going to shake me and beat me and make me feel you know exhausted just after having driving just after driving around in it for you know 20 minutes or so that's not the case at all it's actually pretty comfy
