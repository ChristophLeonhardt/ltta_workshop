ELECTIONS 26 DAYS.

3
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,651
AS WE MOVE CLOSER TO ELECTION

4
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:16,386
DAY, WE LOOK AT PARTICULAR RACES

5
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:17,120
AND THE CANDIDATES RUNNING IN

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:18,221
THEM.

7
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:21,591
TONIGHT WE WANT TO TELL YOU

8
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:24,227
ABOUT KEER CITIZEN CINEMA

9
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:25,195
RUNNING TO TAKE JEFF FLAKE'S

10
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:28,965
SEAT IN ARIZONA.

11
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:29,666
IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN A LONG

12
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,601
ISSUE FOR THEM.

13
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:33,169
CINEMA IS TRYING TO PORTRAY

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,271
HERSELF AS A MODERATE, SOME ONE

15
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:37,941
WHO SUPPORTS AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL

16
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:38,575
ALIENS AND ROBUST BORDER

17
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:41,478
SECURITY.

18
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,580
THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE SHE IS

19
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,081
NOT A MODERATE.

20
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:49,085
IN 2006SINEMA DECLARED THAT

21
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:51,187
ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO DIE SNEAKING

22
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:53,790
INTO THE COUNTRY ARE EQUIVALENT

23
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,325
TO AMERICANS DIEING IN THE IRAQ

24
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:55,592
WAR.

25
00:00:55,593 --> 00:00:57,193
TO SAY IMMIGRATION IS NOT A WAR

26
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:58,928
OR EQUAL IN MAGNITUDE TO WARY

27
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,163
BELIEVE DISHONORS THOSE WHO DIED

28
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:01,464
IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHERS ASKING

29
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:03,266
MY GRANTS.

30
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:04,834
THE DEATHS THAT PEOPLE SUFFER IN

31
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,469
THE MEXICO ARIZONA DESERT ARE

32
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,804
THE SAME AS THE DEATHS THAT

33
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:08,471
PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE IRAQ

34
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:09,506
DESERT.

35
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:10,807
THEY ARE NEEDLESS, SENSELESS

36
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:12,642
DEATHS.

37
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,077
THAT'S NOT A MAINSTREAM POSITION

38
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:15,411
EVEN NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

39
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:16,980
REVOLUTION WE'RE GOING THROUGH.

40
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,384
THREE YEARS AFTER SHE SAID THAT,

41
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:23,253
SIMENEMA DESCRIBED IT THIS WAY,

42
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:25,688
I OPPOSE ALL IMMIGRATION LAWS F

43
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,490
YOU THINK THAT FOREIGNERS

44
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:28,992
BREAKING YOUR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE

45
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,493
EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE

46
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:31,795
CITIZENS DIEING TO DEFEND THEM,

47
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,029
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU MAY HAVE A

48
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,131
PROBLEM WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE,

49
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:36,566
YOUR OWN COUNTRYMEN, THE

50
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:39,502
CITIZENS OF YOUR NATION.

51
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:42,972
SINEMA SEEMS TO HAVE A PROBLEM

52
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:46,109
WITH THEM, HERE SHE IS IN 2011.

53
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,410
>> PEOPLE GO INTO ARIZONA AND

54
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:49,345
SAY THEY'RE SUPER CRAZY.

55
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:50,480
IT IS SOMETHING IN THE WATER?

56
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,614
THE WATER IS FINE, IT'S FROM

57
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:53,016
COLORADO.

58
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:54,450
[LAUGHING]

59
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,185
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE

60
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:56,486
WATER.

61
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,153
THEY JUST, THEY'RE CALLED

62
00:01:57,154 --> 00:02:00,123
REPUBLICANS.

63
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:01,524
>> Tucker: CHARLIE HERD IS THE

64
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:02,992
OPINION EDITOR AT WASHINGTON

65
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:05,595
TIMES, VERY SMART MAN, JOINS US

66
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:05,929
TONIGHT.

67
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,130
CHARLIE, THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO

68
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,531
MUCH THAT THIS IS NOT

69
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:09,632
DISQUALIFYING SAYING THAT THE

70
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,568
DEATHS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN THE

71
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,670
DESERT, TRYING TO BREAK OUR

72
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:14,871
LAWS, ARE MORALLY EQUIVALENT TO

73
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:16,139
THE SOL JESS FIGHTING IN IRAQ.

74
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,840
THREE YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE

75
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:17,540
BEEN OVER.

76
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,908
DOES THIS HURT HER, DO YOU

77
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:19,209
THINK?

78
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,411
>> I CERTAINLY HOPE IT DOES.

79
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:22,712
YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT.

80
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:24,614
WHAT WE'VE SEEN, YOU KNOW,

81
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:25,748
EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THIS, WHAT

82
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,817
THE TEA PARTY HAS DONE TO THE

83
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:29,118
REPUBLIC CAN PARTY.

84
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,920
I THINK THERE WAS HEALTHY STUFF,

85
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,155
FORCING REPUBLICANS TO GET BACK

86
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:33,790
TO SOME OF THEIR PRINCIPLES.

87
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,592
BUT MY GOODNESS, WHAT WE'RE

88
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,493
SEEING HAPPEN TO THE DEMOCRATIC

89
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:39,295
PARTY, ONCE LEGITIMATE PARTY

90
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:41,931
THAT WE RELIED ON TO KEEP THE

91
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:43,933
REPUBLICANS HONEST, OR THE

92
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,602
SUPPOSEDLY CONSERVATIVE PARTY

93
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:45,935
HONEST.

94
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:47,403
AND TO CHALLENGE THEM.

95
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:49,772
THEY'RE GETTING DRAGGED SO FAR

96
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,074
OUT OF THE LEFT OFF THE CLIFF,

97
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:52,976
THAT I DON'T KNOW, THAT

98
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:54,110
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HURT HER IN

99
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:55,545
A DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN ANY WAY

100
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,213
WHATSOEVER.

101
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:58,548
I DO THINK THAT IT MIGHT HURT

102
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,416
HER IN A EMELECTION.

103
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,485
I MEAN, A LOT OF WHAT SHE SAID

104
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:05,455
THERE, IT'S KIND OF HARD NOT TO

105
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,656
CONCLUDE THAT SHE HATES AMERICA

106
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:09,993
F YOU HATE OR BORDERS AND YOU

107
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:11,895
HATE OUR LAWS ENFORCING OUR

108
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,630
BORDERS, THEN YOU KIND OF BY

109
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,499
DEFINITION HATE AMERICA.

110
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,634
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

111
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:20,169
CAMPAIGN SHE'S RUNNING ON.

112
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,038
AND THEN ESPECIALLY, IF YOU

113
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,474
THINK ABOUT, RUNNING AGAINST

114
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,042
SOMEBODY LIKE MARTHA McSALLY, AT

115
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:28,244
THE LEAST SERVED HER COUNTRY.

116
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:28,912
>> Tucker: CAREER MILITARY

117
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:29,746
OFFICER.

118
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:34,117
>> MADE A JOKE OF THE FACT THAT

119
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:35,818
SINEMA BRAG ABOUT HAVING 100

120
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,022
PAIR OF SHOES, AND McCALLY BRAGS

121
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,090
ABOUT 100 COMBAT MISSES.

122
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:41,891
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THE

123
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:43,359
FOREIGN WARS OR NOT, AND I HAVE

124
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,095
A PROBLEM WITH THEM, I THINK

125
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,797
THAT YOU TO COMPARE THE

126
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:51,334
SACRIFICES THAT OUR MEN AND

127
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,236
WOMEN MADE FOLLOWING THE ORDERS

128
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:55,138
OF THE MILITARY, TO ILLEGALS

129
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,739
CROSSING THE BORDER, AND

130
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,875
TIE-DYEING TRYING TO BREAK OUR

131
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,044
LAWS AND GET INTO THE COUNTRY,

132
00:04:01,045 --> 00:00:00,000
IS ASTONISHING.
