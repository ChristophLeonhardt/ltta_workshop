1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
and that's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the Rangers were</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,689
saying is that they patrol these giant

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,700
areas with very few weapons and they

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,870
really can't do anything when you have a

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,099
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffickers coming in they're</font>

sea turtle egg poaching and an unsolved

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,980
murder in Costa Rica was produced by

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff too so why don't we get</font>

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,850
right to it and go to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question</font>

Adam thanks for again for coming on so

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,680

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got there looks just like our office</font>

29
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,180
it does it's designed to look that way

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,350
it's perfect so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was curious how</font>

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,119
severely has recent violence kind of

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,400
impacted conservationists efforts to um

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,110
you know really keep up with their work

34
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,030
and have they seen kind of a downturn in

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,400
volunteer signup since the since the

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,979
violence<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been kind of publicized so</font>

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,780
that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question they</font>

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,549
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did see a downturn in</font>

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,229
volunteers I think upwards of ninety

40
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,509
percent down turn right after this

41
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,329
murder happened it was global news the

42
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,500
interesting thing is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know most</font>

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">beaches most areas in Costa Rica to the</font>

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">overwhelming amount um you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,140
be safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's really not going to be a</font>

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem it was just this one beach that</font>

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,380
um that is super dangerous and that

48
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">beach itself they don't send foreign</font>

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,560
volunteers to that beach right now very

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,170
few people patrol it so you know things

51
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,520
are kind of going up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past few</font>

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">year since that downturn in 2013 I</font>

53
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,009
believe and people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to</font>

54
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,540
return and do these conservation efforts

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,219
and if you want to i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage you</font>

56
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,320
to do so would not be scared because it

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,479
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very safe there but it did seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a tremendous effect everyone we</font>

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,419
spoke to involve in that conservation

60
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,879
community really said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's</font>

61
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,290
a big numbers game the more

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,260
they have the more turtle eggs are able

63
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,269
to save and they had a really really

64
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,549
hard year last year I'm dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all</font>

65
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,370
that well um now that's great to hear

66
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,930
and it definitely seemed like everyone

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,370
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentary kind of echoed</font>

68
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,560
those thoughts um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,420
mostly safe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in conservation in</font>

70
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,129
Costa Rica and that you know it's only

71
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:33,870
specific areas they're kind of affected

72
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,239
and that it's clearly linked to drug

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,459
smuggling what do you think the what do

74
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,480
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the correlation is</font>

75
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,189
specifically between poachers and drug

76
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,540
smugglers do you think a lot of people

77
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,489
are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of drug smugglers are</font>

78
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,560
also engaged in poking or do in poaching

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,579
or do you just think that they're

80
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,019
happening in the same site so there's an

81
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,049
overlap you know I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really say a</font>

82
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,430
hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a lot of us to</font>

83
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,629
do with it happening on the same site

84
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:57,569
you know one of the people we speak to

85
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,090
who is a law enforcement officer says

86
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,250
that you know he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the beach that was</font>

87
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,930
known for drug trafficking maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> jairo</font>

88
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,220
the guy was murdered saw something he

89
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,510
wasn't supposed to see and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

90
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,389
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the most likely case what you</font>

91
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,950
do have though is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system where</font>

92
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,560
when drug trafficking comes into an area

93
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,689
it brings with it guns it brings with it

94
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,940
a matter of solving conflicts do

95
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,010
violence and that starts to pervade

96
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,079
society so that issues that might have

97
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,470
been resolved peacefully or you know in

98
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">in other methods that weren't as violent</font>

99
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,750
become more violent because this sort of

100
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,370
attitude starts pervading society and

101
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have happening right now</font>

102
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:35,400
in certain areas of Costa Rica<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

103
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,659
anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else in the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with drug</font>

104
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,530
trafficking comes into a society um I

105
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,209
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know some of the poachers</font>

106
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,650
they're not drug traffickers but they

107
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,720
are drug addicts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that comes with two</font>

108
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,620
because a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

109
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,400
mid-level or helping with the smuggling

110
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">Costa Rica as a bridge sort of thing are</font>

111
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,569
paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> off in product because that's a lot</font>

112
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,159
cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> for smugglers that are making</font>

113
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">their way north and when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

114
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,250
product you have you know people who

115
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,019
want to move it to other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and then</font>

116
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,519
there comes a demand for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then you</font>

117
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,319
have addicts and that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

118
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,780
another situation that's happening on

119
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,220
the beaches of Costa Rica you have these

120
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,419
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now have to feed their</font>

121
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,120
addiction and that leads to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some</font>

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,440
of them took a poaching because it's an

123
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,029
easy way to make money for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in that</font>

124
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,599
area and on the same topic of kind of

125
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,669
you know just talking about confidence

126
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,099
levels among conservationists<font color="#CCCCCC"> zoom to</font>

127
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,139
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conservationists</font>

128
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,150
looking with and the Costa Ricans in

129
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,069
general even met have<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence in the</font>

130
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,050
government's ability to prosecute drug

131
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,789
smugglers you know it's uh it's a tough

132
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,020
question because we only really dealt

133
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,909
with this specific case and people

134
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,379
weren't too confident but I was told

135
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,499
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case had been somewhere</font>

136
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,659
like the capital of Costa<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rica it would</font>

137
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,370
be it would have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> prosecuted a lot</font>

138
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,229
differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was lee-moan which is a</font>

139
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,210
you know one of the most dangerous areas

140
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,520
in Costa Rica it's known for<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a hub</font>

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">of drug trafficking and they weren't too</font>

142
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,849
confident in the local court system

143
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,939
there um so I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't speak to that</font>

144
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,669
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a more faith in Costa</font>

145
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,229
Rica than you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> find in a lot of</font>

146
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Costa because neighbors of which is why</font>

147
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,650
the way that this case was handled was

148
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,029
so disappointing to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

149
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,310
population<font color="#CCCCCC"> there but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of</font>

150
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,979
that faith has started to waver in light

151
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,229
of this dis killing and a few other

152
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,300
recent big bust and big drug<font color="#CCCCCC"> tracking</font>

153
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,020
scandals very cool what was it like with

154
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,729
experiencing that interview with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

155
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,050
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drug trafficker that you spoke</font>

156
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,580
to I know you can't give away any you

157
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">know too much information about your</font>

158
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,949
sources but what was that whole

159
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,240
experience like for you it was pretty

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,319
relaxed after me we're a little nervous

161
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,589
we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scare the guy away but</font>

162
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,719
the guy who connected us was our fixer

163
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,599
down there who's a pretty special

164
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:47,569
individual who has had ties in both the

165
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,250
drug trafficking world and the law

166
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,599
enforcement world um and he was a he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

167
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,339
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful and pretty confident and</font>

168
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,439
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> setting these things up it's also the</font>

169
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,399
kind of guy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if he's on your side</font>

170
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,169
you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really worried about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

171
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,899
else that's ever gonna happen when he's

172
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:06,439
with you so eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eating the turtle</font>

173
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,699
egg was more stressful for you than that

174
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,550
interview you think yeah yeah definitely

175
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,830
and the moment the thought process that

176
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,259
went with it was definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very</font>

177
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenging were you anticipating like a</font>

178
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jon Snow style trader stabbing when you</font>

179
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,279
got back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the camp you know it was it</font>

180
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,750
like a test for you or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think it</font>

181
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,180
was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh for a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to bar</font>

182
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,800
kind of watching and laughing or was

183
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,379
that uh you know um we were we were

184
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,759
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little inconspicuous in</font>

185
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,270
the bar even though we were

186
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,040
three gringos so we stood out a bit but

187
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">no one really pay attention to us um and</font>

188
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,480
the fact that I was sort of egged on and

189
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,890
encouraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it I wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really my</font>

190
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,590
idea I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done without it but I</font>

191
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,940
was sort of egged on and encouraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

192
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,520
do it by didier who is a big part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

193
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,260
story and is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most you know</font>

194
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,140
premier sea turtle conservationist in

195
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,060
the world someone who's dedicate his

196
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,830
life to this for 25 years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and risked</font>

197
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">his life when he goes out of mowing</font>

198
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,260
beach um he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was enthusiastic about me</font>

199
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,460
trying it he said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an important</font>

200
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,880
part of the culture so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> along with</font>

201
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,700
it absolutely I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it shows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind</font>

202
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,380
of duality that's necessary there that

203
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,150
you know conservation you know there's

204
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,500
there's a part of the tradition that is

205
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,030
going to be maintained and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

206
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,100
to interact with um with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

207
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,140
that's sustainable on I think it's very

208
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgivable to have a certain turtle egg</font>

209
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,500
but thank you so much that's a really

210
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,700
good way of putting it i'm actually to

211
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,960
steal that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer in the future when</font>

217
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,910
for coming on man then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking</font>

218
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,200
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting that turtle egg we actually</font>

219
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,730
got a question via email this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a first</font>

220
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,770
for us okay and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to take a</font>

221
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,680
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this is from Hannah who wants to</font>

222
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,060
know you know what was the thought

223
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,950
process behind eating that turtle egg it

224
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,810
seemed her a bit sensationalist that you

225
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,270
did it so how did you end the editors

226
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,950
and the producers justify including that

227
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,080
scene in the end the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> well yes she</font>

228
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,030
says it all evoke the sense of

229
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,530
sensationalism and was questionable on a

230
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,420
personal ethical level and on a

231
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">professional one how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I justify it um</font>

232
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good question you know</font>

233
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
we did have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of debate in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

234
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,820
office about whether we should include

235
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,460
that and there are still a few people

236
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,800
who think that I shouldn't have I would

237
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,140
disagree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sensationalist it is a</font>

238
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,630
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> coach Costa Rican culture and</font>

239
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,810
tradition and as I mentioned to Aaron

240
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,870
you know we had a dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> with us who</font>

241
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,970
pretty much was like you've gotta try it

242
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,980
now you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that in the in</font>

243
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,830
the piece he's like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an important</font>

244
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of our culture you know wouldn't be</font>

245
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,260
the same if you're reporting on you have

246
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,350
to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it comes from um so</font>

247
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,730
it definitely was a moment where where I

248
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,799
was sort of like is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to do and</font>

249
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,560
I made the decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it at his</font>

250
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,140
urging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm pretty confident that</font>

251
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,400
that you know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have been</font>

252
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">100% right thing to do but I'm okay with</font>

253
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Didier has dedicated his life</font>

254
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,130
to this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is his job this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is his life</font>

255
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,080
and if he was okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me doing it I</font>

256
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,340
don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else could</font>

257
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,680
have a problem with me doing it um and

258
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,500
and as Aaron explained just now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

259
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,730
it is a part of the culture you do have

260
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,290
to understand where<font color="#E5E5E5"> these traditions and</font>

261
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,210
where this culture was coming from so

262
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,340
yeah we went ahead with it we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

263
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,650
of internal debate here and we decide at

264
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,660
the end me and the producer and the

265
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,310
editor decided that it was an important

266
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,070
scene to sort of show home so that's

267
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,470
that's how I justify it it hasn't really

268
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,910
kept me awake at night but it's

269
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,860
definitely something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know I</font>

270
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,960
definitely see where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're Hannah and</font>

271
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,790
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron were coming from and then</font>

272
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,830
asking about it yeah and you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

273
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,260
you're AG<font color="#E5E5E5"> Don to do it a little bit did</font>

274
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,610
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say egged on to do it yeah</font>

275
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">borrowing your phone that's terrible</font>

276
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,860
well you start first so I he didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

277
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,910
it we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of tweets someone</font>

278
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,550
should take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at and this is from</font>

279
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Marat I'm exactly sure how to pronounce</font>

280
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,680
this twitter name so forgive<font color="#CCCCCC"> me but it's</font>

281
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
to party dude the poachers always have

282
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,100
any are do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have any connection to</font>

283
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,170
the turtles or do they just view the

284
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,630
turtles as objects and are the poachers

285
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,030
aware of the harm that they're causing

286
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,140
by doing this poaching what's your

287
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,630
perspective on that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I can all I</font>

288
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,430
can't really speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the poachers</font>

00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,969
poachers do and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think many obviously</font>

311
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,049
are aware of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

312
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,669
awareness campaigns there about what's

313
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,469
happening with the eggs and the endanger

314
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,639
populations and they're aware of the

315
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">conservation of groups out there so</font>

316
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,489
obviously i think you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put</font>

317
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,639
one and one together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that this</font>

318
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,979
is hurting the turtle population<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

319
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,329
for a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's done out of</font>

320
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:26,449
necessity so you know it's either why

321
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,099
are they going to care about turtles or

322
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:29,239
why they going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put that the forefront</font>

323
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,129
if they themselves are starving<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

324
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,079
unemployed and have no way to feed their

325
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,759
children it's really a lot to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

326
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,739
someone when this is their only means of

327
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,199
making any money or you know feeding

328
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,389
themselves to be more concerned with the

329
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,519
plight of turtles than of anything else

330
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,229
um so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I guess I guess I</font>

331
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,699
would say that that according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carlos</font>

332
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,129
he was aware and I think that many many

333
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,779
others are aware it just comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to</font>

334
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,879
necessity well that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

335
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:58,099
answer name I'm very thoughtful but you

336
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,449
know we did get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bonus question for you</font>

337
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,699
here I did and it's from her same

338
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:02,809
tweeter whose name I can't pronounce

339
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,359
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dan are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single and</font>

340
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,519
looking to mingle let's uh let's cut to

341
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">commercial real quick well we have we</font>

342
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,009
have commercials lined up at all not for

343
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:14,839
the internet will talk to our sponsors

344
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,629
about that after this but you know it's

345
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,999
just move on instead I to our next

346
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,889
caller which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lindsey Jones and so</font>

347
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:24,199
let's say at a Lindsay Lindsay you think

348
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,319
hey so I have another question not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

349
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:29,809
get back to the the violence because I

350
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,019
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that too much um</font>

351
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,389
but it seemed like Carlos was describing

352
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,849
that Costa Rica for a long time seemed

353
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:39,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be almost immune to a lot of the drug</font>

354
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,329
trafficking I was happening you know in

355
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:43,189
Mexico Nicaragua where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to be</font>

356
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:45,979
much much worse but it does seem that

357
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,169
and just in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years or is</font>

358
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,670
much more of an increase

359
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,530
the violence why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that after</font>

360
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,200
such a time at now Costa Rica is finding

361
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,810
itself you know more affected by this

362
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,290
drug trafficking now you know I don't

363
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,500
really have a full answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that but I</font>

364
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,480
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know in situations where</font>

365
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,240
drug trafficking routes are paid more

366
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,680
attention to are shut down there's

367
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">always another route that pops up you</font>

368
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that now you know the Caribbean was</font>

369
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,780
popular in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 80s and then there was</font>

370
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,460
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned effort to police it and</font>

371
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,620
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> now recently when going up to</font>

372
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,000
Central America Mexico has gotten a lot

373
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,630
more a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> tougher people have returned</font>

374
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,860
back to that sort of Caribbean side of

375
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,910
trafficking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that way so I assume</font>

376
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,290
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in Costa Rica</font>

377
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,360
that you know el salvador guatemala

378
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,300
honduras<font color="#E5E5E5"> um things have gotten a lot</font>

379
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,330
more violent there in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

380
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,700
decades there's been a heavier presence

381
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,790
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. coming in and encouraging</font>

382
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,010
more strident policing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Costa Rica</font>

383
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,690
sort of this big untapped area that

384
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hasn't been you know exposed to</font>

385
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,690
this before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as the the drug</font>

386
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,810
trafficker drug dealer we spoke to said

387
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know there's now a fight for</font>

388
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,030
dominance<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have these</font>

389
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,860
natural parks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of preserved</font>

390
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,960
coastline where things are just wide

391
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,600
wide open so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a lot of the</font>

392
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,060
reasons why Costa Rica is now now

393
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,280
experiencing this may be also Costa Rica

394
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,890
doesn't have a military<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's seen as</font>

395
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,410
sort of a week in their ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fight</font>

396
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,810
against drug trafficking but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

397
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,040
definitely seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an uptick</font>

398
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,860
there and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know um people</font>

399
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,320
cartels are going to look for any sort

400
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,270
of any chink in the armor any sign of

401
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,590
weakness and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to expose</font>

402
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,090
that and that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they see</font>

403
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,560
in Costa Rica<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort</font>

404
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,990
of wide open<font color="#CCCCCC"> place where they can uh you</font>

405
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,720
know store things there as a bridge as

406
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,400
both people we spoke to who deal with

407
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,920
issues you said where you know cartels

408
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,320
from Colombia or Panama can meet with

409
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,480
cartels from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexico and sort of do this</font>

410
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,320
drop off stage and uh yeah I mean that

411
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,580
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really what the case is</font>

412
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,590
there now it is surprising though that

413
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it was actually left alone for so</font>

414
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,430
long that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of shocked me now</font>

415
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,190
it's also better off economically than

416
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,890
all the countries around it<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

417
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,390
government is seem to be doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

418
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,939
job but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

419
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:04,189
you know traffickers don't care they're

420
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:05,239
going to move in when they have an

421
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,319
opportunity to move in somewhere and

422
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">that seems to be the case to go from</font>

423
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,339
there um the part when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were with the</font>

424
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:11,899
Rangers it kind of seems like they are

425
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:14,359
the only thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that is now stopping</font>

426
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,909
these drug traffickers because yeah I

427
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:19,129
guess they are an easy target if there's

428
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">only a couple Rangers roaming around</font>

429
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:24,169
like what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do how can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we help me</font>

430
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,089
an out them you know I think I think

431
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,869
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty strong anti drug unit</font>

432
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:32,209
in the in the Costa Rican police now I

433
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,069
know the US has put a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

434
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:37,009
into sort of building<font color="#E5E5E5"> up those response</font>

435
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:39,739
teams oh man as the undercover agent we

436
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,879
spoke to said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're they're</font>

437
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,289
out there they're trying to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

438
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:43,809
when it comes down to the national parks

439
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,739
you know there's Coast Guard<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there</font>

440
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:47,959
really isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that heavy police force out</font>

441
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,459
in these parks they're pretty isolated

442
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,079
so it's not like you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a rapid</font>

443
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,609
response team there all the time and

444
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:54,049
that's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the Rangers were</font>

445
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,179
saying is that they patrol these giant

446
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,189
areas with very few weapons and they

447
00:15:58,189 --> 00:15:59,359
really can't do anything when you have a

448
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,559
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffickers coming in they're</font>

449
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,379
heavily armed you know it's it's kind of

450
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,699
certain death if they were to step up

451
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">and try to do something so I think that</font>

452
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:10,579
what the what mr. Molina who we spoke to

453
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:11,689
said was that they need better weapons

454
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,729
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more Rangers and they need to be</font>

455
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">taken more seriously if they want to</font>

456
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,699
stop these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> from happening in</font>

457
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:18,739
their national parks I start over<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

458
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:20,809

465
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,949
if and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> this case was spirit reopen</font>

466
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:38,689
do you think the team is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to head</font>

467
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:41,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">back down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another look you know</font>

469
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,259
think it would be the sort of thing

470
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,689
where I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd have to be at the case</font>

every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

472
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:50,779
lengthy case so I actually don't know

477
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,679
think from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've heard the case</font>
