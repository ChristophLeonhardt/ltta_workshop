can I say one thing I hate to interrupt you can say one thing I want to thank President Obama from the bottom of my heart because I would be dead if it weren't for him just like you I was opposed to the Affordable Care Act when it was passed I told my wife we would close our business before I complied with this law then at 49 I was given six weeks to live with a very curable type of cancer we offered three times the cost of my treatments which was rejected they required an insurance card thanks to the Affordable Care Act I'm standing here today alive being both a small business person and someone with pre-existing conditions I rely on the Affordable Care Act to be able to purchase my home the insurance why would you repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement oh we we wouldn't do that we want to replace it with something better first of all I'm glad you're standing here when the insurance gets so expensive healthy people won't buy it because they it's just a trade off the penalty to not buy it is a lot cheaper than buying the insurance so healthy people won't buy it therefore they won't go and participate in the insurance pool to cover the losses that Citra people who have to have insurance buy it there are good objectives that work that they sought to achieve in this law we agree with that we think young people you should be able to stay on their parents plan until they're 26 we think there needs to be a solution which we have for people with pre-existing conditions but we want more choices lower prices more competition no monopolies
