1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,799
“Outrage outside a detention
center in New Jersey today.”

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:07,259
“The disturbing images of
children being torn from their parents were

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,259
troubling enough.”

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:11,350
“The Trump administration is
reportedly weighing their options of housing

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,620
immigrant children at military bases”

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,410
How did the United States get here?

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,780
In the last 15 years, America has taken in
more refugees than anywhere else in the world.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,860
A fraction of those refugees, asylum seekers,
have grown in recent years to the point of

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:39,260
overwhelming the current system, and now the
country is at a tipping point.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,160
The legal definition of a refugee is someone
who isn’t able to live safely in their home

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,280
country, or has a really strong reason to
fear that they won’t be safe if they stay.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,460
Persecution that is racial, religious, political
or national — or targeting what's called

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,399
"a particular social group.”

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,379
Someone who's been persecuted can apply
for refugee status in their home country or

15
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,210
in the first country that they flee to.

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,049
Where they might apply in a refugee camp
for example.

17
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,060
An asylee is a refugee.

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,680
It’s just that, they’ve already arrived
at another country, like the United States,

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,400
and fear going home.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,340
Here’s how it works:

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,860
Asylum seekers must fill out the i-589 application,
a 12 page form

22
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,079
If that sounds complicated for someone fleeing
an oppressive homeland, don’t worry — there’s

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,170
a 14 page instruction booklet to help.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,140
Both the form and the instructions are only
available in english.

25
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,290
And the i-589 has to be filled out in english,
or it’ll get sent back.

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,399
Not every asylum seeker necessarily
understands the process, or has the resources

27
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,060
to kind of go about it exactly the right ways.

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,000
Customs & Border Protection itself has been accepting

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,900
very few people in recent weeks

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,939
who are presenting themselves for asylum.

31
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:05,380
So people are waiting to be allowed to set foot
in the U.S. and claim asylum for you know

32
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,530
two weeks on bridges in Ciudad Juarez in the
heat of summer.

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,030
At a certain point it starts to seem like
a safer option to go in between ports of entry

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,190
and risk breaking the law.

35
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,300
If someone enters the United States without
papers, they can’t even file an asylum application

36
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,000
until they convince the government — in
person — that they’re in danger at home.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,320
This is called “credible fear.”

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,190
They’re detained and given at least 48 hours
before their credible fear interview, but

39
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,820
asylees often must wait much longer.

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,120
If the fear isn’t deemed “credible,”
an asylum seeker can be deported pretty much

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,740
immediately, unless they file an appeal.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,700
If that fear is deemed credible, or the appeal
is successful, they wait for a judge to review

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,360
their application.

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,260
Yeah, this is where the process gets
very complicated depending on the circumstances

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,260
of the case.

46
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,290
An asylee might have a judge sympathetic to
their case, or one with a stricter view.

47
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,370
They might end up waiting comfortably with
family, or they may be held in a detention

48
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:10,870
center.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,460
And in spring 2018, they could even have been
separated from their children, under Trump

50
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,140
administration policies.

51
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,480
China has historically had the most applicants
for asylum to the United States, and that

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,500
hasn’t changed.

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,880
But applications from El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Honduras have increased 234% in the past

54
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:42,580
3 years, with more applicants in that time
period than the previous 17 years combined.

55
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,300
This area is called the northern triangle.

56
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,530
Civil wars and political unrest from the 1950s
through the 1980s left institutions unstable.

57
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,840
Violence, extreme poverty, and crime stemming
from drug and gang activity is widespread.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,660
Asylees fleeing this area aren’t responsible
for the danger they live in — they’re

59
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,020
trying to escape it.

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,980
In the Northern Triangle, it's a little
more complicated, because instead of talking

61
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,190
about persecution by the government we're
talking about often persecution by gangs.

62
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,959
So, whether they qualify for asylum is up
for interpretation by immigration judges.

63
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,370
And, all of this is being debated while the
current system is straining just to keep up.

64
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,480
The backlog of asylum caseloads has surged
since 2012.

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,730
And immigration attorneys have cited waits
as long as 5 years.

66
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,800
The Trump administration thinks that
the solution here is to make it harder to

67
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,020
even pass the initial screening interview.

68
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,650
If you think of the asylum system as
a multi-stage process — which it is — that

69
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,720
starts with you know asking for and getting
a credible fear interview, and ends with finally

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,450
getting asylum — people are falling off
at every stage of that process.

71
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,420
Very few people who start by asking for credible
fear screenings in the U.S. are ultimately

72
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,570
getting their asylum claims approved at the
end.

73
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,510
They essentially may be deprived of
due process in trying to get asylum and so

74
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:18,070
people who do have legitimate persecution
claims are going to get sent back which theoretically

75
00:05:18,070 --> 00:00:00,000
is exactly the outcome that this entire system
is set up to prevent.
