41
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,560
items he bought one was a cucumber and

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,899
one was a pack of condoms and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

43
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,939
still just in complete silence just

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,350
watched him make the whole transaction

45
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,020
and he was acting<font color="#CCCCCC"> like nothing was wrong</font>

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,810
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all suspicious that's taking</font>

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the piss lately on the news there was a</font>

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,920
story about a really really young kid

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,979
doing air traffic control at JFK Airport

50
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,689
in New York helping plane to take off do

51
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,190
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to say anything other than</font>

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,538
that's definitely taking the piss

53
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,489
there's a pub in my town reading called

54
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,600
the Turks

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,430
I was there one day and there was some

56
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,200
abuse being shouted down from the window

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,940
of an apartment<font color="#CCCCCC"> next door going gate</font>

58
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,910
down the bloody noise and what they'd

59
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,980
moved there like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

60
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know not using their intelligence</font>

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,910
that perhaps moving next to a pub might

62
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,590
mean they would be subjected to noise

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,480
especially if they keep their window

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
open and not only that the pub was built

65
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,280
in the 1500s so I think I know who was

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,690
