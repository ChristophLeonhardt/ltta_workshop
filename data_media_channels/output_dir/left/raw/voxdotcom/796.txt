00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:06,180
The personhood movement began six years ago
in Colorado. It was started by a 21-year-old

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,730
law student there and she had this idea that
she should help pass a law that would add

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,640
unborn fetuses to some of the protections
that everybody else gets. And basically this

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,449
was driven by her belief that life begins
at conception, and therefore any unborn fetuses

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,170
should have the exact same protections that
she has under the law. And she got this onto

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,010
the Colorado ballot. It did not succeed. It
failed. But now here we are six years later

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,940
and there have been five separate personhood
ballots, all of which have subsequently also

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,030
failed. It's shown that this strain of the
pro-life movement is not really having success

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,940
at the ballot box that these generally considered
to be more extreme measures, which could potentially

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,819
ban abortion, they could ban in vitro fertilization,
are not a way for the pro-life movement to

11
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:59,549
win. The pro-life movement has been really
successful with more incremental regulations.

12
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:05,500
They passed 205 separate abortion restrictions
since 2010. That's more than the last decade

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,180
before that. But when you look at these giant,
sweeping personhood amendments, these ones

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,670
that would say life starts at conception or
add what they would call unborn humans to

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,600
the criminal code, those are not succeeding,
and two more defeats in North Dakota and Colorado

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,679
last night suggest that they're not going
to be having much traction in the future either.

17
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:30,130
I think pro-choice groups are generally very
happy with what happened in North Dakota and

18
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,310
Colorado. They were very worried particularly
about the North Dakota amendment passing and

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,310
it failed by a pretty wide margin. So I think
that's reassuring to pro-choice groups. However,

20
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,299
there will probably be dozens more abortion
restrictions that will pass in 2014 with the

21
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,490
state legislators who are just being elected
into office, and that they're certainly by

22
00:01:49,490 --> 00:00:00,000
no means in the clear, that they have a rough battle to fight in the years ahead.
