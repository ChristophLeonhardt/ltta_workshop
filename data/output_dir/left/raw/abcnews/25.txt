TRAGEDIES LIKE PARKLAND, HE HAS 

189
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,587
GONE TO THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL

SHOOTINGS, TALKING PARTICULARLY 

192
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,792
ABOUT ARMING TEACHERS.

193
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,627
THAT HAS BEEN HIS BIG PUSH IN 

194
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,995
RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS, AND 

195
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,129
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, IN FACT, HE 

196
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:42,001
WAS ADDRESSING THE NATIONAL 

197
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:42,668

00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,208
STRENGTHENING -- ARMING, EXCUSE 

202
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,444
ME, IF YOU WILL, TEACHERS.

203
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,046
HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS HE 

204
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,182
WOULD SAY ON HIGH SCHOOLS AND 

205
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:56,649
SCHOOL CAMPUSES.

206
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,353
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAYING 

207
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:00,753
THIS IS A SAD DAY.

208
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,354
WE'RE TOLD BY ADMINISTRATION 

209
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:01,854

WITH THE TEXAS GOVERNOR, GREG 

213
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,961
ABBOTT TO OFFER HIS CONDOLENCES.

214
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,731
THEY ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THAT

215
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,798
SCENE WE ARE WATCHING UNFOLD 

216
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:13,733
BEFORE US.

217
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,368
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE IN CLOSE

218
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,070
CONTACT WITH AUTHORITIES IN 

219
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,272
TEXAS.

220
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,041
WE KNOW THAT THE ATF IS ON THE 

221
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,675
SCENE.

222
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,910
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE SAYS WE ARE

223
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,045
SENDING ALL RESOURCES AS NEEDED 

224
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,379
TO TEXAS.

225
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,914
AGAIN, THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO 

226
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,415
SAYS HE IS DETERMINED TO DO 

227
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,816
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO 

228
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:34,020
PROTECT STUDENTS AND ONCE AGAIN,

229
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,888
HE IS HERE HAVING TO ADDRESS THE

230
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,189
NATION IN THE WAKE OF A SCHOOL 

231
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,456
SHOOTING.

232
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,924
>> ONCE AGAIN, HERE WE ARE 

233
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:42,328
LOOKING AT THESE DISTRESSINGLY 

234
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,629
FAMILIAR IMAGES.

235
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,630
CECILIA VEGA, THANK YOU.

236
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,701
LET ME GET BACK TO BRAD GARRETT,

237
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,403
OUR CONSULTANT IN OUR WASHINGTON

238
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,203
BUREAU.

239
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,538
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE ABOUT WHETHER

240
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,706
ARMING TEACHERS WOULD HELP IN A 

241
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,273
SITUATION LIKE THIS?

242
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,374
>> I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA, IN 

243
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:58,244
FACT, THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES IF

244
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,847
YOU COLLECTIVELY LOOK AT 

245
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:02,514
STUDIES, DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD

246
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:02,781
BE ARMED.

247
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,051
HERE'S THE REASON, DAN.

248
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,052
TRAINED POLICE OFFICERS WHO KNOW

249
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,388
HOW TO TACTICALLY MOVE WITH A 

250
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,756
WEAPON WHILE OTHER WEAPONS ARE 

251
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,391
BEING FIRED AT THEM OR NEAR 

252
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,659
THEM, WE MAKE MISTAKES EVEN WITH

253
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,994
ALL THAT TRAINING.

254
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,295
YOU'RE NOW GOING TO ASK A 

255
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,596
TEACHER WHICH IS NOT THEIR 

256
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,298
PRIMARY JOB, TO PROTECT THE 

257
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,034
SCHOOL, TO NOW TAKE OUT A 

258
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:22,267
WEAPON.

259
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,135
PERHAPS FACING SOMEBODY WITH A 

260
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:30,042
LONG GUN, AND TH AR-15.

261
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:34,046
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA AND THEY 

262
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,982
COULD INADVERTENTLY SHOOT 

263
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,650
SOMEBODY ELSE OR THEMSELVES.

264
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,616
THIS HAS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH, 

265
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,885
AND MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAID, 

266
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,020
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT.

267
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,953
>> THIS IS A COMPLEX AND 

268
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,155
EMOTIONAL ISSUE, AND I SUSPECT 

269
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,557
AFTER THIS LATEST SHOOTING, WE 

270
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,159
WILL SEE THE ISSUE ENGAGE, THE 

271
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,461
DEBATE ENGAGED YET AGAIN.

272
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,528
BRAD GARRETT AND CECILIA VEGA, 

273
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,796
THANK YOU BOTH.

274
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,833
JUST TO QUICKLY RECAP HERE 

275
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,033
AGAIN.

276
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,234
THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER SCHOOL 

277
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:59,639
SHOOTING IN SANTA FE, TEXAS.

278
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,940
FEWER THAN TEN PEOPLE KILLED, 

279
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,510
AND IT COULD BE AROUND EIGHT.

280
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,377
EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN FOUND 

281
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:06,679
ACCORDING TO POLICE ON THE 

282
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,214
CAMPUS AND IN THE SURROUNDING 

283
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:09,414
AREA.

284
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,015
THE SCHOOL AT THIS POINT HAS 

285
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:10,650
BEEN CLEAR.

286
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,417
WE WILL CONTINUE TO COVER THIS 

287
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,852
