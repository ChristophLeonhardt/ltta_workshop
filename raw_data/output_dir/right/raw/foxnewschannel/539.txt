1
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:12,527
>> AMERICA WILL ALWAYS

2
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:15,697
CHOOSE COOPERATION AND

3
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:16,998
INDEPENDENT OVER GLOBAL

4
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:17,732
GOVERNORS CONTROL AND

5
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:18,133
REGULATION.

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,235
WE CANNOT ALLOW A RERAH JET

7
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:22,304
STREAM WHO CHANTS DEATH TO

8
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:23,705
AMERICA TO POSSESS THE MEANS

9
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:26,308
TO DELIVER A NUCLEAR WAR

10
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:26,942
HEAD.

11
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,143
CHINA'S MARKET DISTORTIONS

12
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:30,078
AND THE WAY THEY DEAL CANNOT

13
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:31,680
BE TOLERATE YOU HAD.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,350
ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,185
ALMOST ANY ADMINISTRATION IN

17
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:38,954
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

18
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:41,990
[LAUGHTER]

19
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,060
AMERICA'S -- SO TRUE.

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,427
[LAUGHTER]

21
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:46,328
DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION

22
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:47,062
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

23
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:47,763
[LAUGHTER]

24
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:53,135
[APPLAUSE]

25
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:54,236
BRIAN: PRESIDENT IN THE

26
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:54,670
MOMENT.

27
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,771
AINSLEY: LET'S BRING IN

28
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,605
NIKKI HALEY SHE WAS THE

29
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:59,541
GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE

30
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,243
OF NEW YORK.

31
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:04,980
STEVE: SOUTH CAROLINA.

32
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:02,144
AINSLEY: I LOVED

33
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:07,482
SHE IS IN NEW YORK NOW.

34
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:09,851
AINSLEY: I LIVED IN TWO

35
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,320
STATES I LOVED THEM BOTH.

36
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,487
I KNOW YOU WERE IN THE ROOM

37
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:13,522
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

38
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:14,823
SOMETIMES THE MEDIA CAN

39
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:15,958
PORTRAY IT AS ONE THING AND

40
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,025
IT WASN'T THAT AT ALL.

41
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:17,693
WHAT WAS IT LIKE.

42
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:19,461
>> THE MEDIA HAS GOT THIS SO

43
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:19,761
WRONG.

44
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,296
I DEAL WITH THESE LEADERS

45
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:21,997
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

46
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:23,432
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY

47
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:23,732
THINK.

48
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:25,667
DO THEY LOVE AMERICA?

49
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:25,934
NO.

50
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,536
DO THEY RESPECT AMERICA?

51
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:28,136
NOW THEY DO.

52
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:30,339
WHEN THEY SAID THAT THEY

53
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:31,874
LOVE HOW HONEST HE IS.

54
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,342
AND IT'S NOT DIPLOMATIC.

55
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,810
AND THEY FIND IT FUNNY.

56
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,345
I MEAN, WHEN HE GOES AND HE

57
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:41,083
IS VERY TRUTHFUL THEY KIND

58
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,317
OF WERE TAKEN BACK BY IT.

59
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:43,719
>> THEY ARE NOT USED TO IT.

60
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,953
>> ALL DAY YESTERDAY THEY

61
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,055
WERE FALLING OVER THEMSELVES

62
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,756
TO GET A PICTURE WITH HIM TO

63
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:48,924
TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT HIS

64
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:49,591
SPEECH WAS.

65
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,060
HOW STRONG IT WAS.

66
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,394
WHETHER HE SAID GOOD THINGS

67
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:55,964
ABOUT THEM OR NOT THEY LOVE

68
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:58,200
THAT HE IS HONEST WITH THEM.

69
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,835
AND THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN

70
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:00,169
LIKE IT.

71
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,403
SO THERE IS A RESPECT THERE.

72
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:02,438
I SAW THAT THE MEDIA WAS

73
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:04,273
TRYING TO MAKE IT SOMETHING

74
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:04,707
DISRESPECTFUL.

75
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,475
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS.

76
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:07,576
THEY LOVE TO BE WITH HIM.

77
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:08,509
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU

78
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,512
WILL SEE THAT ENTIRE CHAMBER

79
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,548
STANDING ROOM ONLY.

80
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:13,649
BRIAN: IT WAS THE ECHO

81
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:13,983
LAUGH.

82
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:14,950
FOR EXAMPLE, A PART OF IT

83
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,185
WAS HE PULLED OFF THE

84
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,486
PROMPTER AND REACTED IN

85
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:18,821
REALTIME AND NEVER HAPPENED

86
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:22,458
AT THE U.N.

87
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:22,992
STEVE: AD-LIB.

88
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:23,626
BRIAN: WORLD IS WATCHING

89
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:24,160
AD-LIB IT.

90
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,530
>> THAT MADE THEM LOVE HIM

91
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:27,930
ANYMORE.

92
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,597
BRIAN: YOU DEAL WITH THIS

93
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:29,198
EVERY DAY.

94
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:31,300
AXIOS WHO TENDS TO BE FAIR.

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,874
SPEECH WHAT'S YOUR REACTION

100
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:39,208
TO THAT.

101
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:39,875
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

102
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,543
THE PRESIDENT.

103
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:41,744
HE IS ALWAYS TALKING TO HIS

104
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,111
AUDIENCE.

105
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,179
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

106
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:44,880
KIM, HE WAS TALKING TO KIM.

107
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,348
HE WAS SITTING THERE SAYING

108
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:47,016
THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP TO

109
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,150
BE HAD.

110
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,319
THERE ARE THINGS TO BE DONE.

111
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,187
WHEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT

112
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,154

WHAT HE IS DOING IS SAYING

136
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,852
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE

00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,253

138
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:25,087
TRADE ORGANIZATION.

139
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,923
WE'RE GOING TO DO DIRECT

140
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:27,356
NEGOTIATIONS.

141
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:29,325
HE JUST DID A GREAT ONE WITH

142
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:29,826
SOUTH KOREA.

143
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:30,994
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HE DID

144
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:32,161
ONE WITH MEXICO.

145
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,664
HE IS REDOING ALL OF THESE

146
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:35,064
NEGOTIATION.

147
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,799
SO, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

148
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,700
AMERICANS AROUND THE

149
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,067
SUFFERING.

150
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,469
IT'S FAIR FOR AMERICA.

151
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,404
AND THE COUNTRIES KNOW THAT

152
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,005
IT'S UNFAIR.

153
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,806
THEY KNOW IT HAS TO CHANGE.

154
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,340
THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

155
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,643
BUT THEY KNOW HE IS RIGHT.

156
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,744
AINSLEY: THE PRESIDENT HAD A

157
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:48,578
MESSAGE FOR IRAN.

158
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,213
YOU HAD A MESSAGE FOR IRAN.

159
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:51,614
SO DID MIKE POMPEO AND JOHN

00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:51,948
BOLTON.

161
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,049
JOHN BOLTON SAYING THERE

162
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,584
WILL BE HELL TO PAY IF IRAN

163
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,318
CONTINUES AGGRESSION.

164
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,387
YOU SAID IF EUROPEAN ALLIES

165
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:58,821
DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN THEY

166
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,123
WILL FACE SANCTIONS.

167
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,224
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE NOW FOR

168
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:02,592
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE

169
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:03,993
WORRIED ABOUT IRAN?

170
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,197
>> THAT WE DO NEED TO BE

171
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:08,865
WORRIED ABOUT IRAN HONESTLY

172
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:10,066
IRAN IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE

173
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:10,867
HAVE RIGHT NOW.

174
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:12,736
CAN YOU LOOK, WE ARE HAVING

175
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:15,372
MULTIPLE ATTACKS FROM

176
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:16,873
PROXIES ON EMBASSY IN IRAQ.

177
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:18,507
VERY INVOLVED WHETHER IT'S

178
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,476
LEBANON OR YEMEN.

179
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,543
THEY ARE CONSTANTLY IN THE

180
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,444
MIDDLE OF TROUBLE.

181
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,479
THEY ARE NOT ON OUR SIDE.

182
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,347
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE

183
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,015
SURE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL

184
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,683
COMMUNITY KNOWS TRYING TO DO

185
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,518
BUSINESS WITH IRAN IS ONLY

186
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,452
HELPING TERRORISTS.

187
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:30,620
YOU ARE NOT HELPING THE

188
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,156
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

189
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:33,857
BRIAN: AMBASSADOR IS IT TRUE

190
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,791
THAT THE EUROPEANS ARE

191
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,426
TRYING TO GIVE INCENTIVES

192
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:39,329
FOR THE EU COMPANIES TO GO

193
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,730
IRAN WHICH IS REALLY A THUMB

194
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,032
IN OUR EYE.

195
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,967
AND THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT

196
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:44,634
RESPONDING BECAUSE THEY

197
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,436
DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD

198
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:47,371
INVESTMENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

199
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,306
INVOLVED.

200
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:55,545
IS THAT THE SCENARIO AS YOU

201
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:55,979
SEE IT.

202
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,548
>> THEY HAVE IT SO WRONG.

203
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,483
HAVE YOU THE WOMAN WHO

204
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:00,450
HELPED GET THIS DEAL

205
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:00,851
TOGETHER.

206
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,419
SHE IS TRYING TO HOLD A DEAL

207
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:03,220
TOGETHER BECAUSE SHE DID IT

208
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,955
SHE IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR

209
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,223
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

210
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,023
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHO

211
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,158
NUMBER ONE DON'T WANT TO DO

212
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,092
BUSINESS WITH IRAN.

213
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:09,993
YOU CAN HAVE THAT PROOF BY

214
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:11,128
THE FACT THAT COMPANIES ARE

215
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:12,262
DROPPING DEALS WITH IRAN.

216
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:13,463
THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO GET

217
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:14,297
DEALS WITH IRAN.

218
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,332
BECAUSE THEY GET WHO THEY

219
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,733
ARE DEALING WITH.

220
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,134
STEVE: SURE.

221
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,802
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF FORMER

222
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:19,636
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

223
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,772
KERRY?

224
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,306
BEEN -- SOME HAVE DEPICTED DEPIC

225
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:19,936
BEEN -- SOME HAVE DEPICTED DEPIE

226
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:23,340
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS

227
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:23,707
BEEN -- SOME HAVE DEPICTED DEPID

228
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:25,008
IT AS MEDDLING.

229
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,109
SOME SAY JUST WAIT THIS

230
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:26,943
ADMINISTRATION OUT.

231
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,545
THINGS WILL GET BETTER.

232
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:30,714
>> WHAT SECRETARY KERRY DID

233
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,683
WAS NOT ONLY DISRESPECTFUL.

234
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,317
IT WAS HURTFUL TO AMERICA.

235
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:36,253
WHEN WE ARE SITTING THERE

236
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,455
TRYING TO GET IRAN TO COME

237
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,123
TO THE TABLE IN A WAY THAT

238
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:40,891
THEY UNDERSTAND THE

239
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,525
BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING

240
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:42,125
HAS TO STOP.

241
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,061
THE SUPPORT OF TERRORISM HAS

242
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:44,461
TO STOP.

243
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,495
THEY HAVE TO QUIT SELLING

244
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,930
ARMS TO THE HOUTHIS, WHEN

245
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,265
ALL THOSE THINGS TO HAVE

246
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,533
ANOTHER AMERICAN GO IN AND

247
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,002
SAY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,

248
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,470
THAT ABSOLUTELY IS

249
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,938
ANTI-AMERICAN, AND IT WAS

250
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,240
HURTFUL TO THE AMERICAN

251
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,375
PEOPLE AND IF SECRETARY

252
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:58,976
KERRY WAS SECRETARY OF

253
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,477
STATE, HE WOULD NOT WANT

254
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,578
ANYONE DOING THAT.

255
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:02,780
BRIAN: HE SAYS DR. KISSINGER

256
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,581
DOES THAT AND NO ONE EVER

257
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:04,948
COMPLAINS.

258
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:05,783
>> LET ME TELL YOU A HUGE

259
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,918
FAN OF DR. KISSINGER AND

260
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,954
VERY RESPECTED MAN BECAUSE

261
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,555
HE NEVER GOES OUT OF COUNTRY

262
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:12,990
WITHOUT TELLING OUR

263
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,691
ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE COMES

264
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,426
BACK HE TELLS OUR

265
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:16,193
ADMINISTRATION.

266
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:17,461
HE WORKS WITH US AND TELLS

267
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,497
US WHAT HE IS DOING ALL THE

268
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:20,864
TIME.

269
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:21,532
AINSLEY: KERRY DOESN'T DO

270
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:21,966
THAT.

271
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:22,833
>> SECRETARY KERRY WE DIDN'T

272
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,634
KNOW THAT CONVERSATION

273
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,001
HAPPENED.

274
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,803
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS

275
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:26,503
DOING.

276
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:27,204
DR. KISSINGER YOU NEVER HAVE

277
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:28,706
TO WORRY THAT HE IS NOT ON

278
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:30,474
AMERICA'S SIDE.

279
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,141
AINSLEY: AMBASSADOR YOU ARE

280
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:31,709
SITTING NEXT TO THE

281
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:32,509
PRESIDENT AT THE U.N., YOU

282
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:33,844
WALKED IN WITH HIM, YOU

283
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:34,311
INTRODUCED HIM.

284
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,213
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THE

285
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:37,047
CRITICISM ABOUT HIM AND

286
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,349
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH

287
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:38,816
HIM YOU?

288
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,050
KNOW HIM ON A PERSONAL

289
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,351
LEVEL?

290
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:42,119
>> IT'S GOTTEN SO

291
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:42,720
DISGUSTING, REALLY.

292
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,755
I MEAN, THE IDEA THAT HE IS

293
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:45,923
NOT MENTALLY FIT.

294
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,591
THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD BE

295
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:48,993
TALKING ABOUT THE 25TH

296
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,360
AMENDMENT.

297
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,295
NONE OF THAT IS TRUE.

298
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,630
IT COULDN'T BE FARTHER FROM

299
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,464
THE TRUTH.

300
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,599
YOU'VE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO

301
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,667
IS NONSTOP GOING ALL THE

302
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:57,201
TIME.

303
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:59,036
THE CABINET IS JUST TRYING

304
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,070
TO KEEP UP WITH HIM.

305
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,138
IS HE GETTING THINGS DONE

306
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,173
LEFT AND RIGHT.

307
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,641
HOW CAN YOU HONESTLY THINK A

308
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:04,842
MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE

309
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,810
IS DOING IS GETTING THIS

310
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,812
MUCH DONE ON JOBS, ON TRADE

311
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:10,881
DEALS, ON FOREIGN POLICY,

312
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,383
LOOK AT THE STOCK MARKET, I

313
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,484
MEAN, AMERICANS ARE LIVING

314
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:16,654
BETTER THAN THEY EVER HAVE

315
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:17,455
AND YOU ARE GOING TO

316
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,624
QUESTION HIS LEADERSHIP?

317
00:07:19,624 --> 00:07:20,491
STEVE: WHEN YOU WATCH THE

318
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,093
MAINSTREAM MEDIA THOUGH,

319
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,094
ACCORDING TO THE MEDIA

320
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,695
RESEARCH CENTER, 90% OF THE

321
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,063
COVERAGE OF DONALD TRUMP IS

322
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:26,430
NEGATIVE.

323
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,132
YET, YOU KNOW, HIS

324
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:28,933
POPULARITY, HIS FAVORABILITY

325
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,835
NUMBER HAS REMAINS STEADY OR

326
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,136
HAS GONE UP A LITTLE BIT,

327
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:34,839
WHICH IS A SHOCKING NUMBER,

328
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,073
CONSIDERING ALL THE VAST

329
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:37,408
AVALANCHE OF BAD PUBLICITY

330
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:38,809
HE HAS GOTTEN.

331
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:39,977
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING IS I

332
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:40,645
LOOKED AT THE MEDIA

333
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:41,746
YESTERDAY AND THEY ALL WANTS

334
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:42,947
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD

335
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,482
VIEW OF THE PRESIDENT IS.

336
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:45,616
WHAT THEY NEED TO

337
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:46,817
UNDERSTANDING IS THE WORLD

338
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:47,919
DOESN'T UNDERSTANDING THE

339
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,487
MEDIA IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

340
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,022
LIKE THEY SEE WHAT THE

341
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:52,490
PRESIDENT IS DOING, THAT IS

342
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,325
WHAT MAKES US LOOK BAD IS

343
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:55,927
WHEN THEY ARE CONSTANTLY --

344
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:57,095
I WAS TALKING TO A WORLD

345
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:58,262
LEADER YESTERDAY, I WON'T

346
00:07:58,262 --> 00:07:59,731
NAME WHICH LEADER IT WAS,

347
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:01,399
AND HE SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE

348
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,702
THAT THEY WOULD EVER TALK

349
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:06,671
ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, 25TH

350
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:07,038
AMENDMENT.

351
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:08,506
HE SAID DO THEY

352
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:09,440
UNDERSTANDING THIS IS

353
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,774
AMERICA?

354
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:11,809
YOU DON'T PLAY WITH

355
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:12,410
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

356
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:12,977
AINSLEY: SOUTH KOREA'S

357
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:13,611
PRESIDENT HE WAS PRAISES

358
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:13,878
HIM.

359
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:16,614
>> IT WAS NOT THE SOUTH

360
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:17,315
KOREAN PRESIDENT.

361
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:18,549
LEADERS DON'T KNOW WHY THIS

362
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:19,384
IS A CONVERSATION AND THEY

363
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:20,952
FIND IT DANGEROUS FOR OUR

364
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:21,352
COUNTRY.

365
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:21,953
BRIAN: TALK ABOUT NORTH

366
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:22,887
KOREA IN PARTICULAR, NOT

367
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:24,322
JUST PERT THAN IT WAS A YEAR

368
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:24,589
AGO.

369
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,990
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT WE ARE

370
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,525
ACTUALLY GETTING CLOSER TO

371
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,192
DENUCLEARIZATION, CAN YOU?

372
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,028
>> I THINK THAT -- WELL,

373
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,529
FIRST OF ALL, YES, HUGE

374
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,597
PROGRESS IN THE WAY THAT

375
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,866
HASN'T HAD BALLISTIC MISSILE

376
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:35,198
TESTING.

377
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:36,900
LOOK AT THEIR 70TH PARADE.

378
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,236
I REMEMBER A YEAR AND A HALF

379
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:39,404
AGO LOOKING AT THOSE PARADES

380
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:42,073
AND IT WAS NOTHING BUT

381
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:42,573
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

382
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:43,775
NONE OF THAT THIS TIME.

383
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,043
AND YOU HAVE GOT KIM ASKING

384
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:45,877
FOR ANOTHER MEETING.

385
00:08:45,877 --> 00:08:47,812
AND YOU'VE GOT HIM STARTING

386
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,047
TO SOCIALIZE WITH THE REGION

387
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,214
AND TRYING TO FIND PEACE.

388
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:51,549
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY.

389
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,850
WE HAVE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO

390
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,586
BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO GET

391
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:55,553
HIS CONFIDENCE AND TRUST

392
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:56,621
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

393
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,256
ATTACK HIM.

394
00:08:58,256 --> 00:08:58,690
STEVE: RIGHT.

395
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,825
>> HE HAS GOT TO GIVE US THE

396
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,027
TRUST THAT OF COURSE HE IS

397
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,495
GOING TO DO WHAT WE SAY.

398
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:04,529
BUT EVERY LEADER IS THANKING

399
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:05,397
THE PRESIDENT FOR WHAT HE

400
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:07,165
DID ON NORTH KOREA.

401
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:07,799
STEVE: KIM JONG UN IS A

402
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,300
DIFFERENT KIND OF NEGOTIATOR

403
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,635
THAN HIS FATHER.

404
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:11,169
>> VERY MUCH.

405
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,872
SO AND THE PRESIDENT TAPPED

406
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:14,306
THAT.

407
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,940
HE TAPPED THAT.

408
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,208
THAT'S WHY KIM SENT HIM A

409
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,443
NICE LETTER SAYING I WANT TO

410
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:19,044
MEET AGAIN.

411
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:19,911
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY GOOD

412
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:22,114
WHEN YOU PUT HIM IN FRONT OF

413
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:23,515
A FOREIGN LEADER.

414
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:24,382
BRIAN: ONE THING IS CLEAR I

415
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:24,950
THINK YOU ARE GETTING

416
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,585
RESPECT ON BOTH SIDES, I

417
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,353
WATCH YOU ON EVERY SINGLE

418
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:29,688
SHOW YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS,

419
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:31,189
ESPECIALLY AS GOVERNOR OF

420
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:31,857
SOUTH CAROLINA I DON'T KNOW

421
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:32,791
HOW YOU HAVE THE DEPTH OF

422
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,658
KNOWLEDGE ON ALL THESE

423
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:33,992
THINGS.

424
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:35,961
THEY SAY ONE OF THE KEYS IS,

425
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,129
AMBASSADOR, THE DEAL YOU CUT

426
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,230
HAVE YOU DIRECT ACCESS TO

427
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,897
THE PRESIDENT.

428
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:40,565
ANY TYPE OF GRAY AREA YOU

429
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:42,334
CAN CALL AND YOU CAN RELAY.

430
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:42,934
IS THAT TRUE?

431
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:43,735
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT?

432
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:46,805
>> HE IS UNBELIEVABLY

433
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:47,205
RESPONSIVE.

434
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:49,374
I GO TO D.C. ONCE A WEEKS.

435
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:49,875
I SEE HIM.

436
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,675
I TALK TO HIM.

437
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,676
IF I NEED ANYTHING I CAN

438
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:52,811
PICK UP THE PHONE.

439
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,046
IF I DISAGREE WITH

440
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,180
SOMETHING, HE LISTENS.

441
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,114
HE MAY DO IT.

442
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:57,449
HE MAY NOT DO IT.

443
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:59,852
BUT I HAVE -- I AM VERY

444
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:00,385
APPRECIATIVE OF THE

445
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:01,687
RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH THE

446
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:02,054
PRESIDENT.

447
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:03,422
THE REASON I'M TABLE TO DO

448
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:04,790
THE JOB I DO IS BECAUSE IS

449
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,691
HE SO INVOLVED.

450
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:08,227
LAST NIGHT HE WENT AND

451
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:08,794
HOSTED MEMBERS OF THE

452
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:09,562
SECURITY COUNCIL AND THEIR

453
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:10,830
FOREIGN MINISTERS.

454
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,797
THINK ABOUT THAT.

455
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:12,665
NOT WORLD LEADERS.

456
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:14,033
THE ONES THAT MAKE THE

457
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,768
DECISIONS EVERY DAY ON THOSE

458
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,236
NORTH KOREAN SANCTIONS ON

459
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,839
THE ARMS EMBARGO.

460
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:20,706
STEVE: I BET THEY LOVED

461
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:21,007
THAT.

462
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:22,642
>> THAT BUYS SO MUCH

463
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:23,242
GOODWILL FOR THE UNITED

464
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:23,576
STATES.

465
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:26,879
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT.

466
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,115
AINSLEY: AMBASSADOR YOU WEAR

467
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:31,284
THE SOUTH CAROLINA EMBLEM.

468
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:32,518
GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA,

469
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:33,486
U.N. AMBASSADOR NOW YOU HAVE

470
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,053
A GLOBAL VIEW.

471
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,188
ANY PLANS TO RUN FOR OFFICE?

472
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,456
I MEAN RUN FOR PRESIDENT ONE

473
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:38,291
DAY AS A FEMALE?

474
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,558
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

475
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:41,060
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I

476
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,094
WILL TELL YOU NEVER FORGET

477
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:43,429
WHERE YOU COME FROM.

478
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:46,198
THAT'S WHY I WEAR MY SOUTH

479
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:46,999
CAROLINA NECKLACE.

480
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:48,401
I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE NOT

481
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:49,969
THOUGHT ONCE ABOUT RUNNING

482
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:50,603
FOR PRESIDENT.

483
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:51,637
THESE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE

484
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:52,905
TALK ABOUT 2020.

485
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:54,173
I WOULD NEVER RUN AGAINST

486
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:55,141
THE PRESIDENT.

487
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,409
I WOULD CAMPAIGN FOR THE

488
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:56,776
PRESIDENT.

489
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:58,177
I MEAN, WITHOUT QUESTION HE

490
00:10:58,177 --> 00:10:59,845
HAS DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB.

491
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,648
SO, I'M GOOD ABOUT NOT

492
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,684
THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE.

493
00:11:04,684 --> 00:11:05,351
>> Steve: YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

494
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,252
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOUGH

495
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:07,586
IS TRAFFIC BECAUSE NOW THERE

496
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,221
IS GRIDLOCK BETWEEN HERE AND

497
00:11:09,221 --> 00:00:00,000
THE UNITED NATIONS BECAUSE
