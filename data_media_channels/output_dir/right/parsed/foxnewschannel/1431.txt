CANCELED.
BOTTOM LINE, MARTHA, IT MAY BE
GETTING BACK ON TRACK.
>> Martha: WAIT AND WATCH, SO
FASCINATING.
JOHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HERE ARE NOW IN A STORY
EXCLUSIVE, NEWLY CONFIRMED
AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY, RIC
GRENELL.
AMBASSADOR, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
DO YOU THINK THIS SINGAPORE
SUMMIT WILL HAPPEN?
>> I THINK AS PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAID, WAIT AND SEE.
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS
FRUSTRATED MANY ADMINISTRATIONS
BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,
AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE
ACTION THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS.
THIS ALL STARTED FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOING REALLY
TOUGH DIPLOMACY WITH THE
CHINESE.
WE HAVE SEEN THE CHINESE RAISED
THEIR HAND FOR SANCTIONS AT THE
U.N. MULTIPLE TIMES, AND YET,
NOT REALLY IMPLEMENT THOSE
THINGS.
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DATA EARLY
ON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION WAS
SIGNAL THAT DIPLOMACY WAS GOING
TO BE TOUGH, AND HE PRESSURED
THE CHINESE TO ACTUALLY
IMPLEMENT THE SANCTIONS THAT
THEY HAD VOTED FOR PREVIOUSLY,
IN CONSECUTIVE YEARS.
SO WHAT WE SAW PRETTY QUICKLY
WAS, ONCE THE CHINESE DECIDED TO
IMPLEMENT THE SANCTIONS, WE SAW
ACTION.
WE SAW THE NORTH KOREANS FEEL
THE SQUEEZE, FEEL THE SQUEEZE OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DIPLOMACY, AND
COME TO THE TABLE.
NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE CLEAR EYES
AND WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS
PRESIDENT KNOWS HOW TO
NEGOTIATE.
I HAVE SEEN HIM NEGOTIATE AND HE
ALSO KNOWS HOW TO REALLY USE
BOTH THE CARROT AND THE STICK,
IF YOU WILL, AND HE'S BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL AT THAT.
>> Martha: THAT IS WHAT WE ARE
SEEING WITH THE CTE DEAL, WHICH
YOU WONDER IF IT ISN'T GETTING
BACK ON TRACK.
>> HE HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO
FIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND USE ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT HAS.
NOT JUST MAKE ONE ARGUMENT BUT
HE WILL SAY AS HE SAID TO
PRESIDENT XI EARLY ON, IF YOU
HELP OUT WITH NORTH KOREA WHICH
IS A VERY SERIOUS POLICY FOR US,
A THREAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IF YOU HELP US OUT ON
NORTH KOREA, HE WILL BE ABLE TO
GET A BETTER TRADE DEAL FROM US.
THOSE TYPES OF NEGOTIATION
SKILLS, TO INTERMINGLE MULTIPLE
ISSUES, I THINK IT IS A
FANTASTIC WAY TO NEGOTIATE.
I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME TO SEE A
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY USE ALL OF
THE TOOLS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL, AND THIS
PRESIDENT HAS SHOWN HE IS
WILLING TO DO THAT.
>> Martha: I WANT TO PUT UP A
TWEET THAT YOU SENT MAY 8TH,
RIGHT AFTER YOU BEGAN YOUR
AMBASSADORSHIP IN BERLIN.
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, U.S.
SANCTIONS WILL START TO TARGET
IRAN.
U.S. COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN
IRAN SHOULD WIND DOWN OPERATIONS
IMMEDIATELY.
THERE'S LOTS OF CORPORATE
ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN EUROPE AND
IRAN AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY
WANT TO UNWIND THAT AMBASSADOR.
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
VERY CLEAR ABOUT U.S. SANCTIONS
ON IRAN.
AND HE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT
COMPANIES GET TO CHOOSE.
THEY CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO DO
BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES,
OR THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO
BUSINESS WITH IRAN BUT, THEY
WON'T GET TO DIVORCE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN CLEAR
ABOUT THAT AND SECRETARY POMPEO
HAS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT.
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE
THROUGHOUT EUROPE ARE COMPANIES
TELLING US THAT, OF COURSE THEY
ARE GOING TO CHOOSE THE
UNITED STATES.
WHEN FORCED TO MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT CHOOSING EITHER DOING
BUSINESS WITH THE MOLA, OR THE
UNITED STATES, IT'S THE
DIPLOMAT'S DUTY TO FOLLOW THE
DIRECTIVES AND POLICIES AND BE
OUT FRONT.
ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS
PRESENT THAT CHOICE TO
BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT EUROPE.
IT IS THEIR CHOICE, THEY CAN
DECIDE WHICH GOVERNMENT OR WHICH
MARKET THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO
PLAY IN, AND AT THE END OF THE
DAY, WHATEVER THEY CHOOSE IS
THEIR DECISION.
