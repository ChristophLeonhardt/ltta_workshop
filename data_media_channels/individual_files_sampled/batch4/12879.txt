I saw a cartoon once and I think was in a newspaper it was an old couple walking out of a funeral and the man says to the wife I've got to start living a better life and the joke of course is kind of a subtle joke but the joke is that when people die you only say nice things about them and you go to a funeral and you listen to the eulogy and you think god this guy was great I stink you know so all week long I've been reading about the people who died so tragically in Las Vegas there was construction worker guy named Jack Beaton died threw himself over he threw his body over his wife's body an off-duty cop named Charleston Hartfield he coached a youth football team Hannah dollars a full-time wife and mom to three kids and her brother called her our sunshine and I was thinking to myself you know you could also say about these people that they did bad things they lied they were a hypocritical they woke up sometimes in the middle of the night and thought gee I said this thing that I wish I hadn't said I did this thing that I wish I hadn't done and the way I know that about them is because that's true of every single person on earth you know st. Paul said what I want to do I don't do and what I hate I I do we are all in that battle st. Paul also said we're not in a battle with flesh and blood but we're dealing with rulers and authorities and cosmic powers over this present darkness we're fighting the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places and as you know I don't like the word evil because sometimes we use it to obliterate our opponent we don't have to argue with somebody if he's evil but if you look at it from another way it actually makes you more sympathetic with people when you realize we're all in the same battle with the same power of darkness that is very real and very true and that nobody actually wants to talk about it so we're gonna talk about it today and we're gonna talk about some of the ways that the Heroes of Las Vegas dealt with it and what they what they have to say to us mona Charen the great mona Charen a terrific columnist is going to be on to speak with us and we got a lot of other things to say as well stuff I like trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show it is hard to believe that the clave endless weekend is back again I gotta say it's just one piece of advice run for your life don't go out don't get stay under the bed just keep there just getting worse and worse I see there's another hurricane headed for Florida I know I know this is why Michael Knowles and I will be trying starting our new podcast on Friday the 13th so the end of the next week if the devil that I swear I was just saying to Malthus this is a true story when I wrote this story this is a thick it's called another Kingdom it's a fictional story that we're releasing as a podcast in several parts and we will be producing it as we as we go along when I wrote this story I was struggling with another story that I couldn't make work and suddenly like a light coming over me the entire another Kingdom just appeared to me at all totally different story I wasn't even thinking about it was just there when I sat down to work it out it just came I thought wow this is weird because it's not like my typical story it's got it's a different than the usual stuff I write and I started to say to my wife you know I think this is a story that comes from above I think I've been actually sent this story because it's almost like it's not mine and I thought wow I wonder if that's going to aggravate and aggravate our common enemy the the devil and I finish this I swear this is true every now and again we get these really ugly little caterpillars that come out into our house and we just kill one it'll come up through the bathtub or something like this they always just make me feel like that I hate this thing the day I finished another Kingdom I swear this is true they were all over the house I mean usually I get one like every three months or something like this suddenly they were everywhere and there were every place that I would go like I would be on the floor doing situps and I'd look around there'd be one right next to me it was like a horror movie so Knowles and I have been fighting forces of darkness since this began because everything keeps going wrong but I think we're gonna be ready on Friday the 13th I hope so we will be putting it out on the Ricochet Network

yourself so those of you who listen regularly or watch regularly know I'm a sexist ya know I think that's a fair thing to say but what do I mean by that I believe that not only do I believe that men and women are essentially different I believe that the only two kinds of people there are you know I mean I really don't believe very much in race race doesn't matter to me I'm anti racist philosophically but also just my observations tell me that a man of one color is pretty much like a man of another color and a woman of one colors pretty much like a woman of another color but men and women are really different and because of this it's one of the reasons I always listen to what women are saying to me because I know they're telling me something that comes from another place and a lot of times look men and women are do good things and bad things like all of us and when men do bad things they tend to be bad men things and when women do bad things they tend to be bad women things and vice versa when they do good things they tend to be typical of their sex and obviously each individual is different and all that but I'm just saying speaking generally I always listen to what women say because I feel like they see things that I don't see they see things from a position that I don't see and I think if I add that to what I'm saying maybe I can get a fuller picture this is a specially true of moms and people not allowed to say these things anymore but it is true when I am listening to commentate taters on the news and I know that I'm listening to a mom I sometimes hear them say things and I think like nobody else is talking about this and the reason I'm saying is last night I'm watching special report that bret baier show which is my favorite but the only TV news show i think is any good really it's really the one thing where they give you a pretty fair s fox would say fair and balanced report they have this panel at the end where they have different people come on in commentate and Molly Hemingway is on and Molly Hemingway has been on this show a couple of times and I love her to death and but she is also she just says things where I just think not only there's nobody else say those things but there's so mom and nobody else listens to me no so all week long and we're not going to talk about this much because I'm just sick of it I'm sick of the politicizing of this tragedy you know the Democrats have just been the left in general have just been they just politicize these things they want to get rid of your guns they don't want you to be free people they don't want the government from the bottom down they want from the top up so they immediately go after the guns which with which you would have to defend yourself if you needed and they just keep saying stupid things because they don't know anything about guns most of them they're in this this bubble what did Patricia Arquette say she's an actress good actress actually well you know I agree I think we're on the same page you know that's absolutely right but Tim Kaine that's not a stupid thing exactly true but Tim Kaine who as you remember was running for the vice presidency right this guy wanted to be your vice president here's what he said about remember Hillary Clinton was saying oh now they're pushing silencers because there was a pill to make silencers easier to get because they protect your ears they don't they don't really they're not really silenced their suppressors they bring this on down a little but you could hear I mean I mean a machine guns like a jackhammer you will hear it so here's Tim Kaine talking like an absolute idiot our country they think of our country is the place where these massive tragedies occur and we do nothing absolutely nothing and for the Congress to do nothing when the population overwhelmingly supports reasonable steps well and and we're scheduled to have a vote this week on whether it should be easier to get silencers this guy killed 60 people maybe more by now and he injured more than 500 people and he only was stopped finally because he didn't have a silencer on his weapon and the sound drew people to the place where he was ultimately stopped can you imagine what this would have been if he'd had silencers all these weapons but Congress is poised to vote this week to make it easier to get silencers it's like we've we've lost our minds on this issue how do you know when a Democrat saying something stupid is because his mouth is moving right Dawkins absolute nonsense and they're all talking absolute nonsense we have guns because we want to be free people governed from the bottom up not from the top down so they have this panel and the news is essentially a male enterprise if you think about it here are the facts here's what happened even when they discuss it they discuss it in terms of policy and also and Molly said something and I sat up and I thought that's the one truly wise thing one of the few truly wise things anybody has said this week so just listen to Molly when she was asked about the debate over gun control and they nobody heard what she said except me I think I just and I just really sat listen to this at least in this case we're talking about something that was involved in this actual deadly incident which is not usually the case when we go through this ritual of talking about gun control after any deadly event and that is something we kind of do to make ourselves feel better about the fact that no amount of gun regulation is going to prevent people who are hell-bent on murdering people from doing so and we've learned that through so many terrorist incidents involving planes trucks fertilizer and any number of other things so we're pretending we're having a debate about gun control but we're really having a debate about the nature of evil and whether a big enough government can contain it nobody nobody even responded to it but that's of course what we're doing that is of course what we're doing in it I just like theirs so mom because the thing that the thing that moms here's they hear the the thing that you need not what you say like my kids come to me and they say I need this and I give it to them you know I find a way to get it for them and sometimes my wife will say why'd you give him that that's not what they wanted and I you know that's above my pay grade that's it mom pay great dad is like you want it here it is you know that's and that is of course what we're talking about we are of course talking about not about guns because now immediately on this on this panel and I love the battle but they mmediately on this panel Wentz is talking about bump stocks those things that the guy used to apparently you know make them shoot faster a completely meaningless conversation whether they banned them whether they don't ban them people will be able to modify guns to shoot faster they haven't has absolutely nothing but what molly was talking about was actually important that actually mattered because we are talking about evil and there is a difference between the left and the right here I'm not talking by the way about ordinary people who might vote Democratic for any number of reasons and people who vote Republican I'm talking about the leaders the people who go on TV when I talk about the left I'm mostly talking about the media who tell the Senators what to do and the Senators I'm these leaders who are talking about nonsense they're talking about whether or not a government we if we just keep making government bigger we can do something about evil and of course the left believes the answer is yes because they don't really believe in evil they don't really believe in the in the forces the principalities and powers that st. Paul talked about and we do and so it makes they they think we sound weak when we say life is tragic people who can do evil things but of course that's the answer you know there's still this is a very strange story this entire story about the Las Vegas shooting because they still haven't figured out the guy's motive and the reason that's so strange is because you think if you do something like this you want everybody to know your motive why would you do it you know why are you doing it if not to sort of advertise yourself and go down in history even in evil history and make yourself known and get attention paid but this guy must have been planning this for over a year the police have started to say he must have had help they're just they don't know they're just suggesting it I mean they're all these rumors one of the reasons I'd like them to find the motive pretty soon is because I think all these rumors come out people are saying oh there was another shooter and I you know I just don't buy any of it until I hear this from some official or it's proved to me but it's really human to look for motives and now you know they've been interviewing the guy's girlfriend she put out a statement that her lawyer what was the lawyers name mark Lombard put a red statement and read a little bit of this what she said she said the guy gave her no clue this is cut number two I knew Steven paddock as a kind caring quiet man I loved him and hoped for quiet future together with him he never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen a little more than two weeks ago Stephen told me he found a cheap ticket for me to the Philippines and that he wanted me to take a trip home to see my family like all Filipinos abroad I was excited to go home and see family and friends while there he wired me money which he said was for me to buy a house for me and my family I was grateful but honestly I was worried that first the unexpected trip home and then the money was a way of breaking up with me it never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone so no clue from that you know we don't know how much of that is true we know we've heard people witnesses saying that he mistreated her or at least treated her brusque Lee there's like I said the sheriff says that there might have been another person helping him and there was indications that he was hoping had an escape plan and all this stuff but it's just all rumor at this point the FBI an FBI spokesman said we're talking to people overseas so we don't even know about the political aspect of it yet with all the garbage noise going down Donald Trump of all people not always the most tactful or restrained person he struck just the right note he went to Vegas yesterday made his speech and he really said some some great stuff this is cut number nine we struggle for the words to explain to our children how such evil can exist how there can be such cruelty and such suffering but we cannot be defined by the evil that threatens us or the violence that incites such terror we're defined by our love caring and our courage in the darkest moments what shines most brightly is the goodness that thrives in the hearts of our people that goodness is our lighthouse and our solace is knowledge that the souls of those who passed are now at peace in heaven here on earth we are blessed to be surrounded by heroes as one eyewitness recounted this week while everyone else was crouching police officers were standing up as targets just trying to direct people and tell them where to go the officers were standing up in the line of fire to help those in danger and to find out where those horrible shots were coming from words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night see when when Tim Kaine says he goes over to foreign countries and he's embarrassed because they think this is what America is Tim Kaine ought to be a little less embarrassed would be saying that this is what a merry let me show you what America is Thomas Gunderson was there he's a young guy got shot in the leg the president came to visit him I think this thing has gotten like 12 million it's on on YouTube and he put out on Facebook he said I will never lie down when the president of this great country comes to shake my hand here's the video if you can see if you're watching you can see him he gets out of bed and Melania is saying get back in bed but you play the I loved I loved the Trump line this guy looks tough to me and you know what he said was when the president of this great country I'd like to think he would have done that for Obama - you know it's really this see this is the thing again I started out this week by saying you know the the divisions in this country aren't gonna be healed on the news they are they are making the divisions Fester they mean to do it it serves their political term that politicians mean to divide us Jimmy Kimmel means to divide us they mean to divide us because they think they can win in that division but the answers are gonna come at this level the level of guys like understand that's one of the reasons I love this one guy he was he's a copy machine repairman he said he got his family out of the of the kill zone and then went back in and was credited with rescuing up to 30 people the thing I love best about him as a novelist is that his name is Jonathan Smith okay his name is John Smith it's like the kind of name you know if you were signing into a motel you don't want anybody in it so he could be anybody that's the point we can that's think they think he's you know he says he's just he says himself I'm just an ordinary guy I'm just a human being but but listen to what you know when he was talking he was on CNN and he was talking about why he went back this is cut number three honestly I I don't know what I was thinking the moment that I got brother and my three nieces across the street and aisles I don't know what made me turn back around maybe it was the screams I don't I don't know but there are a lot of people still running out a few of them fell down I still remember it vivid I tried not to honestly but I really can't explain why or what made me turn around I just felt you know what if I can help one person or multiple people at least that's someone life that was to bear so he's gonna live they say maybe for the rest of his life is gonna have a bullet in his neck right and as he's coming out so this guy goes in this copy machine repairman named John Smith I'd like you really you can't make that stuff up you know he goes in and he's back he runs back into the kill zone and pulls out 30 people helps 30 people out now he's shot in the neck and he's bleeding he goes down and an off-duty cop it's unbelievable off-duty cop from San Diego this staunch is the the blood this is cup number four from the moment I got hit he was the first one actually it helped me stop ibly he never left my side at all and I remember getting him helping me get in the back of a pickup truck a red pickup truck with another young lady that had a gunshot wound and out I don't want to die I don't want to die he kept saying you're not gonna die I got you I mean so this is like a chain of heroism going on one more clip I got I got a play we have mona Charen is gonna come on and talk to us one more clip i got a play from hannity he had a young lady on named Cassidy Hough who is suffering from cancer she's beating cancer I hope his prognosis seems to be good but she's been under chemo you know what chemo does to you just like absolutely lazy out she's frail she's weak and she talks about her escape and how she too was finally rescued by a cop Ennis this is Cassidy Huff talking to Hannity with her mom I started running trying to beat the crowd and it was very scary because I didn't want to get trampled because I were so weak and my mom lifted me up through like a some type of pretzel stand or something and and then we ran from there but it's like a bad dream where you can't you want to run so fast but you can't because my legs just wouldn't let me still recovering I mean you've been through a very tough treatment and I know people home will want to know you do have a pretty good prognosis right now and so far scans are clean mom a bunch of people came over to your daughter I'm calling you mom and Kelly I'm sorry off-duty police officers it's tough to carry a kid tell us what they did for your daughter well as soon as we had crossed the street initially she basically collapsed behind a car and just couldn't go and before I could think about what to do an LAPD officer just scooped her up and said keep running and his girlfriend grabbed my hand and we continued to run and take cover between behind another dumpster so the Hannity starts crying too you know this is like my point here by the way is that yeah when things like this happen evil seems big because one guy can cause so much destruction a few guys at nine and 11 that can cause so much suffering and pain and evil is big evil is the Emperor of this world this is the Empire of evil and we're kind of like the American revolutionaries fighting back with taking these little pot shots from behind the wall and from behind a tree every time you tell the truth when you want to tell a lie every time you speak a word of kindness when you want to say something angry and hurtful every time you stay true to your word and then at these great moments these big moments when evil really unleashes you have these moments of heroism when you see that these little acts are actually big acts and I it's it's a long maybe even eternal battle no government can stop evil but I do believe we can hold out and that the cavalry is on the way and mona Charen is here Mona Sharon is a syndicated columnist and a political analyst really one of the smartest observers of politics around she works she lives in the Washington DC area is a senior fellow at the ethics and Public Policy Institute and has a podcast called need to know you have a new book don't you is it coming out yes so yeah I have this book but the frustrating part is that where as we live in an era when things happen instantaneously book publishing is still on the 19th century scheduler doesn't come out until June okay well good we'll get to see you again in June but it is good it is hilarious that you could press a button and publish your book pretty nicely actually I mean we have a guy here Michael Knowles who published a blank book and made a quarter of a million dollars I said to Ben Shapiro now we know what we're doing wrong we're putting words in our books you know but anyway we'll have you back in June to talk about your book so all week long I've been talking about this I have to ask you a little bit about this I've been so struck by the comparison between the meanness of the press and the pettiness of our political debate and the immensity of the heroism and decency of the people out there we don't know what politics they had we don't know the guys that when they went in and rescued people we don't know who is a Democrat who was a Republican it seems like the country is operating at a higher level than our spokespeople that is a very very valid valid observation on your part um let me say something a little bit about masculinity because whenever whenever we have one of these horrific situations whether it's the shooting in the Aurora movie theater or in Newtown or in on that French train again and again what you see well and and here in Las Vegas there but there were men who leapt forward to throw their bodies on their wives their girlfriends even sometimes total strangers women jumped in front of their children people do these things in a split second you have no time to think is this the best move for me you know it's like they're there it comes from the deepest part of who they are that they're gonna be self sacrificing for another and the reason I mentioned about the men is that we're living in an era when masculinity is being called toxic when we're constantly told about how bad men are and men can be bad nobody you know needs to tell you that that's of course in the nature of the human beast but there's also something unbelievably noble himself sacrificing about men in particular they rush to defend women they rush to sacrifice themselves this way it's very moving and it's the best of what it means to be a human and we shouldn't lose sight of that you know I know that if we're going to talk about the college campus situation and the rape and so forth and there's definitely men who are behaving badly and there always will be but but I I worry that this this tendency in our society to pathologize masculinity in general is is a very nigga it's very you know it's unfair and and it's very destructive you know that is such a great point and it really I opened the show by talking about the fact that I really I'm always particularly attentive when I hear commentators on politics who are moms and I know you are a mom and I was talking about Molly Hemingway earlier the way they say things that come out of for me come out of the blue it really is as if though it goes back to my point that normal people everyday people who live with members of the opposite sex learn this great respect and love for the differences between us while at the top level in the level of public talk there's all this battle going on that really is it's different than our ordinary lives it's different than the lies Wheatley right although it does have a corroding effect it filters down and there's a lot of unhappiness out there between men and women and it's it's sad because it's a certain minimum amount I suppose is inevitable but I think we have way more than we really need to and that's partly because so many of our young people are being fed an ideology that says that the men are oppressors and women are oppressed and vice versa I mean there's there's there's a certain amount of misogyny that is now very fashionable in you know in public discourse and I've never been a feminist but I am an anti misogynist yes well so my I'm a FEMINIST and an anti massage exactly well you wrote this really interesting piece I mean with recently the the Secretary of Education whose name I'm always de Vos Betsy Duvall Betty de Vos Betty to us yeah Betsy she she withdrew the Obama era Dear Colleague letter that essentially demanded that colleges give a higher rate of belief you know get more belief based it basically stripped guys were charged with rape on college campuses it stripped them of their rights to a fair trial and basically put all of the credibility on the accuser and none on the guy who's charged but you wrote a piece saying earlier saying both the right and the left do not get this issue the issue of campus rape now what why did you say that this kind of feeds into what you were just talking about right so there's on the left what you have is kind of the hair on fire anti-rape activists you know who say that there is an epidemic of rape that it's either one in four or one in five women are being raped college campuses which if it were true would be arrayed higher than you know in chat or you know like really dangerous parts of the globe it's it's it's it's exaggerated on the other hand there is a tendency and this is what I find so frustrating about the right is that whereas they used to recognize that when you drop all sexual standards and when you say anything goes women are gonna get hurt and men are gonna be encouraged to behave like louts most conservatives used to think that and used to say it and used to say that it's you know that men have to be taught to be gentlemen they have to learn that there are certain things you cannot do and one of them is if a woman is drunk you don't take advantage of her right and there is a lot of that there's a ton of it I've talked to a lot of kids and the research for my book and I've talked to kids who are religious you know serious Christians and Catholics and and they all report that they know somebody who was raped they were raped themselves that you know they are highly aware of this problem and it is it's a mistake I think for the right to say oh it's really it's just a bunch of hysterical feminists complaining because what really happened was the sexual revolution left women so vulnerable the feminists don't want to recognize that but the right doesn't really grapple with it anymore either the rights just saying oh shut up and enjoy yourself no way they do feel it because I mean the thing that always got me about the feminists is they basically said women are the same as men and they should be able to enjoy sexuality the same way men do and I thought like why I mean why if there's anything different between us and I think there's a lot that's different between us spiritually as well as physically but if there's anything different between us it's the way we have sex so why shouldn't women's experience be different than men's right but but go back to this thing about the right what what isn't it what are you now hearing from the right that that makes you feel that this is a lost battle I mean yeah okay so there is this understandable okay there's an understandable focus on the men who've been mistreated and railroaded in these kangaroo courts that's far enough okay but then there's a tone that creeps into the commentary of you know failure to draw some moral lines and say look they're not all cases of just regretted sex I mean there are really horrible cases out there guys who are who have committed real rapes or who have committed at least something that should be called sexual assault and you don't see conservatives writing articles about those cases they let the left handle that and this young one young woman that I was reading who had written to Bret Stevens fellow columnist your time I'm not near - he's at the New York Times she wrote you know why have why have conservatives seeded the issue of rape to the left why why do conservatives never seem concerned about this and that's a fair point yeah yeah it's you know you mentioned this thing about the drinking and whenever you bring this up people accuse you of blaming the victim obviously it is unwise for a woman to let herself get drunk around a bunch of strange men but the other scientists that you mentioned is also true I grew up that was a very very strict rule and if the girl you were with was drunk you didn't take advantage of that miss you took her home and many of us did it with our throats closed because we wanted to take advantage of her so much but that has gone completely by the board's in a world where people are told that we're all the same basically that we're all the same and that it's just a fun thing and it's not any more serious for a woman than it is for a man and it's led to terrible terrible consequences so what my book is about is is trying to clear away the mess and try to get back to the basics I mean you were saying earlier about sexual behavior between men and women experiencing sex differently and why is it that women don't get credit for how for their own experience the feminists would argue with us but but I say it took thousands of years of civilizational progress to get to the point where women said to men you have to subordinate your natural sexuality to our natural sexuality right you have to do it our way which is be faithful to one person stick with me you know to be a good father to your children don't cat around and eventually civilization got to the point where they that became the standard and we threw that away yeah I know it is amazing to me how often progressivism is regressive - into the past into the things we knew know already are wrong we've done them already we've been yeah so so let's talk a little bit I I don't have much more time but I want to talk just a little bit about Donald Trump because you were very opposed to Donald Trump and you've remained as I read your stuff very opposed to him I have kind of made a separate piece I mean I have this problem with his manners I have a problem with the way he talks sometimes and the way he treats people around him but I do i I can't help but notice that he is a voice for people who have had no voice you know he is a voice with all these people all these comedians on late-night every single one of them has the exact same political point of view every actor and actress who stands up and accepts an award same political point of view the news people all same political point of view they're all giving comfort aid and comfort to the Democrats and of course the Democrats all have the same political point of view from in being kind of a bully and a loudmouth has kind of given a voice to all these people who have been cut out am I just am I just being a Pollyanna here maybe that was not the right term but I mean have you have you no sympathy for him at all rotten stereotype about close-minded stupid conservatives at his mouth every day and he's cruel to people including his Attorney General as I think you were kind of alluding to or it doesn't matter how long your employee you've served him he'll kick you in the teeth if he's in a bad mood so no I don't I don't have any any sympathy for him I of course have sympathy for people who voted for him because they were faced with a terrible choice but that is in the general election I don't have sympathy for those who voted for him and he's president I mean I hope that he gets the hang of it and changes or at least inhibits his most destructive tendencies but I don't think this is going well I know I'm in a minority most Republicans are happy with him I'm in the minority I well you know that III have to say that ya know I I have to say that I am happy I'm happy with the rollback in regulations I'm happy with the judge's appointments I'm happy I'm happy with the fact that's the CNN who I just consider a bunch of liars and clowns I'm happy that they're on their back heels even even though I you know I understand that Trump is no real of a great lover of truth and beauty but but it is nice to have somebody slap these guys around because they so deserve it I mean they the news media so deserve deserve but you know I gotta say you're you're taking an ethical stance and I have to approve where can people hear your need-to-know podcast oh it's on the Ricochet web good night yeah so if you just go to ricochet and look up podcasts we're there once a week J Nordlinger and I and we have guests and we'll have to have you as a guest please don't be happy I would be happy to come on mona Charen syndicated columnist a really terrific political observer it's great to see you and come back on when your book comes out likewise it's great to see you too thank you bye she's great I just bought her yeah she's really really really smart all right let's see I think we're coming to the end we're coming for that Cleveland sweet it's like a train isn't it it's like just train barreling toward us sounds like a disaster stuff I like we gotta go into stuff I like oh we oh I can't see the stuff I like thing oh okay sorry that's my favorite part the little figure of me with a lose flag running like doing a cans at can-can or whatever so I want to talk a little bit about it's October so we're coming into Halloween I want to talk about a little bit about this new horror that has been coming up it's really been coming up for a couple of years now small indie horror without big special effects sometimes a little mysterious sometimes a little uh you know raises doubts about what you're seeing but that is being used to address social issues in a way that goes above politics which is what art should do Archer you know you I think a Democrat and a Republican should both be able to sit and watch a good work of art and turn to each other and say you know I saw this not you know that you saw different things but you both acknowledge that you're talking about the same subject so that I think this really started I it's always hard to say where these things begin but the the best the first one that made me really sit up and took take notice was it follows in 2014 and it follows was a really simple story about STDs basically right it's about a monster who if you sleep with somebody it follows you and comes after you and destroys you and so here is a guy and you've got to pass it on to get rid of it but even if you get rid of it it can come back and get you after the other person the person you gave it to is too droid so it starts out with this guy who basically drugs date rapes this girl and then tries to tell her he ties her up so he can explain to her what is going to happen next and here's that scene this thing it's gonna follow you somebody gave it to me and I passed it to you back in the car it could look like someone you know or it could be a stranger in a crowd whatever helps they get close to you it can look like anyone but there's only one of it that's a really creepy movie and it's written and directed by David Robert Mitchell one of the really interesting things about it is you can't tell when it takes place it takes place in Detroit but the dresses are kind of 1950s all the technology it looks like 1950s all the movies that they watch are in black and white and all the stuff they're always watching old movies but at the same time there's a girl in it who has a you know a it's a cell phone or some kind of wireless device there are all kinds of reference the way the sex takes place the casual sex of it really is not from the 1950s it's really from today and so it takes place kind of at all time late and there's Detroit is just a sort of setting of decay that's around at all and so if you're conservative you're sitting there and looking and say yeah you know if we had only not abandon the you know if we not have the sexual revolution but if you were you know in Detroit that's the problem of Democrats and all this but leftist could look at it another way the point is he's kind of isolating this thing this absolute play you've STDs that we're living through I hope you're not living through it because you're living such a chaste and honest life but you know that the country is living through and he isolates it and elevates it to the level of an anxiety and of art that was also true of the film get out which came out last yeah this year that actually came out earlier this year which was by Jordan Peele of key and Peele two of the funniest people around I was really sorry when they broke up but this is about a black guy with a white girlfriend who's invited back to her parents house to meet the the rents basically and it turns into a nightmare because every black person he meets there is weirdly zombie-like and then on occasion sort of breaks through so here is this guy he's acting like the he's acting like the mas pious guy imaginable he's wearing the straw hat he looks like a 60 year old silver haired wasp gangster except he's a black guy and he starts talking about the black experience and then if you can't see it the hero takes a picture of him then the flash kind of wakes him up for a minute I find that the african-american experience for me has been for the most part very good although I find it difficult to go into detail as I haven't had much desire to leave the house we've become such home bodies yes yes yes but even when you go into the city I've just had no interest the chores have become my sanctuary this is another creepy picture with a really exciting ending but again you know here's a story where I looked at it and all the the evil white people in it are Democrats so I thought yeah this is a Democrat but of course I don't think when I actually was at Blum House where they made it and I was talking to some of the story people there and one of the women was talking about how you know what a liberal movie it was it was this kind of left-wing movie I thought I said to her there are no Republicans in the movie they're not not one everybody in it voted for Obama including the bad guys and I thought like that you know so you can see it but the point is it elevates the question of it's a it's a question of assimilation it's a question of whether or not we can all sort of become one people even when we have different cultural experiences different skin colors and all this stuff which brings me to the latest one which is it comes at night which just came out is just came out on DVD it's been out for a while just you can now get it on Netflix and everything like this and this is by a guy named Trey Edward Schultz did you see Krisha I haven't seen it he wrote his first movie is supposed to be terrific and I haven't seen it but I will watch it but this is a really mysterious story I didn't like the title because there's nothing in it that comes at night yeah if you call your movie it comes at night something ought to come at night but that's not actually what it's about it's very hard to say what it's about first of all this movie could have been made except for the fact that scott joel edgerton in it was you know a miner he's an indie star and a really good actor at times and aside from that it could have been made for I don't know $100,000 which is nothing for a movie it's just basically four or five people in a house in the woods we don't know what's happened we know there's been some kind of apocalypse we know that there is a plague going around that they all are defending themselves against and basically it's a it's also has a mixed-race couple which I only mentioned because it's just mentioned in the movie the joel edgerton his wife is black and their son is black and their their living alone in this house and some strangers come some strangers who seem like decent people another a man a woman and a child and they need water and they need food and they need shelter and so they they take them in and the problems that arise are not problems of good versus evil they're problems of self-interest so this is the scene where you know they're just getting to know the guy of this family and he seems like a really good guy and joel edgerton talks to his son about him it just gives him a warning yeah I think this pause ah that's cool yeah good people huh yes I like the man why are you just keeping in perspective okay I don't need to tell you but you can't trust anybody good family as good as they seem just don't forget that agree yeah so you know this is and it's wonderful that the problems that come up are so basic they're not horror movie problems the the boy is 17 and the house-wide the wife who comes is young and beautiful and he's attracted to her you know it's not it's not a big deal it's just an aspect of the story as he would be of course attracted to her there's no other woman for him to have their child is small and the child is irresponsible they have to follow certain rules to keep the bad guys out and keep the diseases going on it's very mysterious if you go on rotten tomatoes it got high marks from critics but low marks from people ordinary people kind of watched it and said you know what's going on here where's the monster what's going on but this is part of this new horror thing and what I think it's talking about is it's talking about this this kind of global world we're in where we feel a certain amount of xenophobia of fear of foreigners but some of that fear is legitimate you know some of the people who just openly welcomed some of the large influx of Muslims into Europe are now saying oh wow this is really bad our women are being attacked we can't train these people out of their cultural habits that are bad for the West you know nobody wants to be like this you know this is one of the things I always object to and when the left charges people with Islamophobia nobody just woke up one morning and said you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna hate Islamic people that's not the way it works you know we see things there are problems we have to address them and what I really liked about this movie is it really addressed in a very very hard realistic way the fact that you have to protect the people you love first you have to protect your town first you have to protect your family your friends and then your country first and that creates all kinds of difficulties it's a very very powerful very quiet film if you're looking for real slash-and-burn horror obviously that's not it but that's not what I like I really like these this new spate of horror films I hope there are a lot more before the movement as all moving stood eyes out but I hope there are more I'm sorry folks I can't help you anymore it's Clavin Lewis weekends is here you know batten down the hatches store up some fresh water you know get your guns together we'll end with Tom Petty Tom Petty died this week that's sad and all this Las Vegas news it was hard to take notice but his song one of his most famous songs certainly speaks into the heart of this country and to the heart of these people who are resisting not just the evil that comes you know on a sudden and looks so big but the everyday evil and also the people who are trying to divide us here is Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and stand my ground and I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show survivors gather here on Monday
