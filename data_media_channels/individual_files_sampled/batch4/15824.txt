new statistics from Dimas show that the British people aren't all that happy with mass immigration a new document has been released by Dimas which is a think-tank in the UK so cross party think-tank that's been around since around 1993 and this document is called at home in one's past nostalgia as a cultural and political force in Britain France and Germany and it looks at lots of different areas of culture immigration identity that kind of thing and there's some really interesting stuff in here I mean it's things that we know and I'm sure anybody watching this knows but again it proves our point so on page 7 it says 43 percent of Britons believe immigration has been positive for Britain so 43 percent think immigration is fine but 44 percent believe that it's has a negative development 44 percent now and there's always something interesting with these kind of studies is the amount of people who say that they think immigration is negative it's almost certainly higher because a lot of the time people are terrified to even speak ours so I imagine it's gonna be a few points higher than 44% like edging towards 50% of the people believe that immigration has been bad and 43% say it's being good but the numbers get even more interesting so let's carry on with this most hostile to immigration are conservative voters at 55% leave voters 63% they've got a whole extra section for northerners northerners are one of the most hostile groups to immigration at 53 percent of northerners and the working class is 51 percent now to some people this may look like but us northerners those know those 8 them immigrants you know but it's not true it what it means is the northerners in the working class of the people that are experiencing it most sorry I mean there are many areas across the South of England which are completely obliterated I know but it's the northern working classes who were so often overlooked by the politicians so 53 percent of us northerners I'm 51 percent of working classes don't like immigration who woulda thunk it 71 percent of Britons believe the immigration has made the communities where migrants have settled more divided 71% of the British public think that the areas where immigrants go it becomes more device divided why do you think they think that is it because maybe it's true could that be the case it reached 78 percent of people in areas that report having experienced large-scale migration in recent years and 81% among conservative voters so 71% of brett's believe that immigrations make communities more divided and in the areas where have seen huge scales of immigration 78 percent think that the area has become more divided now 78 percent of people in an area that's experienced large-scale migration the 78 percent are probably the people that were there before the immigration so the other 22% are probably immigrants am I wrong only 9% of the country think the communities where migrants have settled have become more United only 9 percent of people think that these communities have become more United and you know who those 9 percent of people are they're the Liberal Democrats they're the Labour Party they're the young people they're the insane political ideologues who hate democracy and just want to welcome in half the third world sorry all the third world and then it goes on to talk about community and British culture and it says here 46 percent of Britons believe the government should prioritize economic growth over stronger communities that's an interesting one 46 percent of people think that the economy is more important than stronger communities ie safe communities I would think that includes but 34 percent more than a third of adults were willing to favor community over prosperity I guess I'm one of those people I care about the economy but the community is really important and if kids are going to be getting gang-raped if there's going to be stabbings on the street I want to tackle that first let's sort the economy out afterwards although actually those things go hand in hand as well the economy just go hand in hand with this kind of thing so here that's it an interesting one I'll leave you with 47% of Britain's and 76% of leave loaders feel that protecting British values should be favored over multiculturalism 47% of the public think that British values are more important than multiculturalism and again you can expect it to be a few points higher than that because people are terrified of saying this even even you know you get stopped in the street with a clipboard and you asked do you think British values are more important than multiculturalism and say you're in Luton Town Center and you're looking around like this what are you gonna say to be honest in some areas I know what I do well I probably just ignore them but many people would say oh what a culture ISM of course of course who's gonna want to be outed as a racist so I'd say over fifty percent of Britons let's be honest this is compared to 36 percent of citizens and 55 percent of remain voters who feel welcoming different cultures is important now the interesting bit of this is that 45% of romain voters feel that welcoming different cultures is a bad idea isn't that interesting does that not make the point that many people voted remain not because they want high immigration not because they think multiculturalism is gray maybe they just wrote it because of the fear mongering of the government I mean they did send out that leaflet remember that leaflet how many non-political people who are concerned about certain things do you think actually voted remain just because they think well the government says that's the case so it must be I think the statistic proves that point interestingly 55 percent of Britons do not believe the government's doing enough to promote traditional British values I would agree with that but 55 percent of the public do as well so I mean all hope not lost and sixty-six percent of conservative voters believe their own party is not succeeding in this area in power as do 80 percent of believe voters compared to 33 percent of remain voters so what's the take-home here well we've learned that remain voters aren't necessarily completely Pro multiculturalism which suggests that maybe people voted remain out of fear I mean there was project fear if you remember that and what we found also is that a majority of the British public you're concerned about British values and a majority the British public think that immigrations made us more divided I wonder why they that could it be could it be politicians that maybe immigration hasn't been the the fairy tale that you've told us it's going to be could it be that people are experiencing negative negativity and problems in their hometowns could it be that people aren't happy about children getting raped by paedophile gangs from a certain ideological background because we're going to be careful what we say now could it be that all these things are terrifying people could it be that people actually want to live in a prosperous a free a beautiful a Western and a European and a British Britain could that be the case the most seems to show that that is in fact the case if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team be sure to download the brand-new app from
