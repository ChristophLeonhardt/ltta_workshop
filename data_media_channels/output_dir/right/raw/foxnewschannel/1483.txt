00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:22,283
KOREA.

16
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:22,984
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT WOULD

17
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,185

A LITTLE BIT NECESSARY.

31
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,534
WOULD HAVE TO BE A RAPID

32
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:40,201
PHASE IN.

33
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,336

39
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:47,742
RIGHT.

40
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:48,643
FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE,

54
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:03,324
THE PROBLEM IS KIM JONG UN

55
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:03,758

00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:05,093

76
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:31,052
NUKES.

77
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:32,253
STEVE: ALL AT ONCE.

78
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:33,254
AINSLEY: HE SAYS WE ARE NOT

79
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:34,389
AGREEING TO THAT PRESIDENT

80
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,024
ART OF THE DEAL SIT DOWN

81
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:37,525
WITH THEM AND PHASES THEY

82
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:39,160
MIGHT WORK.

83
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,228
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO DO

84
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,729
THE PHASE IN SO THEY GET THE

85
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,897
MEETING OR IS IT MORE

86
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:44,299
IMPORTANT TO GET RID OF THE

87
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,300
NUKES AND DON'T HAVE THE

88
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,633
MEETING?

89
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:52,240
>> I THINK NORTH KOREANS

90
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,341
INSIST WE GIVE UP THE

91
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:53,675
DEMAND.

92
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,576
IT'S BETTER TO HAVE THE

93
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:56,077
MEETING.

94
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:56,911
AINSLEY: I AGREE.

95
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,346
>> FIRST OF ALL, NORTH KOREA

96
00:01:58,346 --> 00:02:00,648
HAS ENOUGH WEAPONS, AIMED AT

97
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:01,816
SEOUL, BIGGEST CITY IN SOUTH

98
00:02:01,816 --> 00:02:03,184
KOREA THAT THEY CAN KILL

99
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:04,252
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

100
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:05,987
PEOPLE THE FIRST DAY WITHOUT

101
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:06,921
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

102
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,189
SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY

103
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,760
CAREFUL ABOUT A WAR.

104
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,795
LAST THE LAST THING YOU

105
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:14,095
WANT.

106
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:15,463
TRUMP HAS RATCHETED UP THE

107
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:16,397
PRESSURE, HE HAS MADE IT

108
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,565
VERY REAL.

109
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:18,966
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT

110
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:19,801
SECRETARY POMPEO'S SPEECH

111
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,369
ABOUT THE IRANIANS WAS ALSO

112
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:22,370
AIMED AT THE NORTH KOREANS.

113
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,238
IT WAS A VERY TOUGH SPEECH

114
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:25,273
AND SAID BASICALLY WE'RE

115
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:29,744
GOING TO TAKE APART YOUR

116
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:30,945
ECONOMY REMINDER TO THE

117
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:32,113
NORTH KOREANS YOU DON'T WANT

118
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:34,782
TO PLAY NICE, FINE WE ARE

119
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:37,652
GIGGER THAN YOU WE WILL NOT

120
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:39,687
PLACE MARIA NICE EITHER.

121
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:41,389
BRIAN: AFTER THAT MEETING IN

122
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:41,689
CHINA.

123
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,458
HE MENTIONED IT.

124
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,693
AND THEN VICE PRESIDENT

125
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:46,728
PENCE HARDLY A ROGUE COMES

126
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:47,995
OUT AND SAYS THAT LIBYA

127
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:51,232
MODEL IS ALWAYS AN OPTION

128
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:52,266
THEY CAME BACK AND CALLED

129
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,868
HIM A POLITICAL DUMMY

130
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:54,235
YESTERDAY.

131
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:54,902
THAT PERSON MAKING A

132
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:56,003
STATEMENT IS VERY TIGHT WITH

133
00:02:56,003 --> 00:03:00,475
KIM JONG UN WITHIN HIS

134
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,976
ADMINISTRATION HERE IS THE

135
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:03,111
BALANCING PROBLEM THEY HAVE

136
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:03,378
GOT.

137
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:07,648
DICK SHARE THESHIP DEDICATED

138
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,684

NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND

140
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,220
PROTECTING THEMSELVES.

141
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,355
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SPENT

142
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:15,256
ENTIRE LIFE DOING.

143
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:16,257
THIS KIM JONG UN ONE OF THE

144
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:17,258
PEOPLE COMMENTED TO ME MAY

145
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:20,228
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GOING GOIG

146
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:21,262
TO SINGAPORE BECAUSE HE

147
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:26,267
MIGHT NOT BE ALLOWED BACK

148
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,035
IN.

149
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:28,703
BRIAN: THAT WAS THE CONCERN

150
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:29,404
OF THE SOUTH KOREAN

151
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:46,821
NEWSPAPER THERE MIGHT BE A COO

COUNTRY.

160
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:52,593
>> REAGAN USED TO SAY TRUST

161
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:54,562
BUT VERIFY.

162
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:55,863
THE NEWS OF THIS GUY IS

163
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:58,433
DISTRUST AND REALLY VERIFY.

164
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,568
I THINK AS LONG AS HAVE YOU

165
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:02,136
POMPEO AND BOLTON AND TRUMP

166
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:04,372
ALL MOVING IN THE SAME

167
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:06,941
DIRECTION, AND I THINK IT IS

168
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:12,346
A GOODED IN TO -- I THINK I

169
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:13,247

00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,950
GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WAS A

171
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,517
VERY DELIBERATE.

172
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,452
BOLTON'S COMMENT WAS

173
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,288
DELIBERATE AND ALSO A

174
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:20,654
REMINDER.

175
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:21,622
WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK IT OUT

176
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:23,958
SO YOU SURVIVE.

177
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,660
BUT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS

178
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,931
WHERE YOU DON'T SURVIVE.

179
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:30,798
STEVE: WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE.

180
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:31,566
>> I LIKE THAT.

181
00:04:31,566 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S GOOD.
