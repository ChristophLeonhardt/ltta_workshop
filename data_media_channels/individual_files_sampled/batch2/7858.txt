so Donald Trump is now tripled down to be fair the CBS News poll was the undone after he only doubled down on moral equivalency between other protesters of Nazis and the Nazis themselves and they asked people do you approve of Trump's response to the Charlottesville attack the only 34 percent approved 55 percent disapproved that's not nearly low enough that I was really disheartened by that number okay yes better and worse independents are the ones that decide elections whether we like it or not they are more against them than the average American so that's a good thing 30 to 32 percent improved 53 percent disapproved of his reaction but look at the Republicans 67 percent approved only 22 percent disapproved so maybe I gave Republican voters too much credit earlier in the weekend and I had a debate about it and she said it won't move him and I thought that it might move some of the has the the moms in Kansas that are Republican voters but that find him to be a bully and a tyrant according to one focus group but you know what even in that focus group they all held they all said they would still vote for Trump and here's two-thirds of Republicans going you want to blame the people who got killed who were there to protest against Nazis as they were chanting the Jews will not replace us as they were caring in Klan outfits and white supremacist outfits and swastika two-thirds of Republican voters saying yeah that's fine blame both sides no problem make the Nazis and the anti Nazis on the same moral plane that is deeply depressing I am in some regards a fire-breathing progressive and apparently I had too good an opinion of Republican voters I guess they're much worse than I thought okay have Trump policies encourage racial unity overall 12% yes come on 44% say it has encouraged racial division and 39% said not much effect okay that's that's a perfectly fine result you know of course I think he's and clearly increased racial division but that's the plurality so that's okay among independence he does even worse again so that's really good news 11% believe he's brought more racial unity 43% say he's brought more racial division and 40% say not much effect let's go to Republicans again here they're having trouble saying he brought racial unity even the Republicans but still 25% say brought racial unity only 15% say racial division so the racial unity is still a much higher number and 56% saying not much effect basically I don't see it he's lost most of the country he's lost two-thirds of the independence if there was an election today he'd be in a world of trouble he thinks he can pull a rabbit out of his hat again you were running in against a person who was deeply disliked who was a symbol of the establishment and the elites people didn't like I don't know that you're gonna get that lucky again that's up to the Democrats but even so these are disastrous numbers but when you look at the Republicans and how strongly they're still holding on to them even after is equivalency on Nazis it is depressing state of the Republican Party in today's America if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if you become a member TYT Network comm /join
