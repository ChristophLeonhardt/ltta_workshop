If Dr. King came back and
seen the way things are,
he wouldn’t be pleased with it.
No, he wouldn’t
be pleased at all.
All right.
I call us 
sanitation engineers
because we’re supposed
to run the job,
not let the job run us.
I was 24 years old
when I started.
But back then, it was
a different ball game.
Back then, the working
condition, it was unbearable.
After three weeks, when
I got my first check,
I broke down and cried.
We were working full time.
And at the same time,
the wages were so low,
we was qualified
to get food stamps.
We were determined that we was
going to get a union organized,
that we would see justice.
We were striking about the
wages, fair treatment
and dignity.
When we heard that Dr. King was
coming to Memphis to help us
in that sanitation strike,
we were very surprised.
We knew then that
there was somebody
that cared about our struggle.
We was at Mason Temple
this particular night.
Dr. King said, the Lord allowed
me to go to the mountaintop
and to look over into
the promised land.
And he said, I might
not get there with you,
but we will make it
to the promised land.
Everybody was just
jubilated, just
excited, not knowing
the next day
would be a day of silence.
Because of Dr. King’s death,
that was one of the reasons
that Mayor Loeb went on
and signed that union
into a decree.
We got what we wanted,
but at the same time,
we lost the great leader.
“He never thought in terms
of his personal welfare,
but always in terms of the cause
which he dedicated his life to.”
I really had a lot of animosity.
I came from the streets.
I was a street thug.
And Dr. King was the
one that taught me,
through his humility
and his leadership.
I said, that’s the
way I’d like to be.
“— united will never be defeated.
The workers united
will never be defeated.
The workers united
will never be defeated.
The workers united
will never be defeated.”
There are still some unsolved
problems need to be solved.
“What do we want?”
“15.”
“When do we want it?”
“Now!”
“What do we want?”
“15.”
“When do want it?”
“Now!”
It is what it is until somebody
can roll his sleeves up and get
out there and fight.
