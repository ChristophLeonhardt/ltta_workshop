as a sociologist of religion I can tell you that criticism brings correction and as soon as you try to silence criticism then you're gonna get a whole world of evil happening and we don't have to look to Islam to find examples we can see this within Christianity and I I point that out in my article that whenever there's been a silencing of criticism within Christianity it's just lend bad things and we can think of the abuse within the Catholic Church and we can also see within the evangelicalism which is conservative Protestantism but when there wasn't proper critique there they were more hostile toward homosexuals they were less likely to treat women well but when there is critique it actually has a reforming side to it and as a result you begin to see improvements within that religion and in the way it treats other people and you're making comments on changing approaches in Christianity in recent generations but of course one could go back centuries to Protestantism at its beginnings I mean the right to criticize one's own religion is a fundamental part of Western civilization but the concept of it see have the gates are closed that that's sort of that's an Islamic way of thinking not all Muslims share that but would you say that's on the rise in political Islam no criticism fundamentalism like I want to strengthen those within the Islam that want to reform it want to enlighten it want to bring it into modernity I'm worried that they're on the losing side of the battle right now yeah I would agree with you on that Ezra um we've got political groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims who have actually advanced definitions of Islamophobia that say that even dislike against Islamic practices better cultural practices or political practices well that that qualifies as Islamophobia and that that to me is a really dangerous kind of mission now we know that they had that definition because they promoted it to the Toronto School Board and then it was later amended because so many community groups spoke out against those are specific community groups but but we know that there are Muslim groups in Canada that think that no criticism of Islam should be welcomed and and that's a dangerous thing to see because obviously I really believe and I think the majority of Canadians believe that criticism brings correction that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
