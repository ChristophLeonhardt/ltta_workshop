00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:05,193
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING,

3
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:06,427
WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON

4
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:07,028
TONIGHT.

5
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:07,962
WE'RE COMING TO YOU THIS

6
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:10,064
THURSDAY UNFORTUNATELY FROM A

7
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:10,765
VERY SICK CITY, A PLACE WHERE

8
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:12,367
MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE

9
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:13,401
AREN'T JUST WRONG BUT

10
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:14,602
INCREASINGLY ARE IRRATIONAL.

11
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:18,106
WASHINGTON IS IN THE GRIP OF

12
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:19,574
UNPRECEDENTED MASS HYSTERIA OVER

13
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,074
RUSSIA.

14
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,242
YES, RUSSIA.

15
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:21,809
TAKE THREE STEPS BACK.

16
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,411
IT'S A FREEZING, POOR COUNTRY ON

17
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:25,680
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE

18
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,281
WHERE THE AVERAGE LIFE

19
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,183
EXPECTANCY IS LOWER THAN THAT IN

20
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:30,251
BANGLADESH.

21
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:30,952
RUSSIA'S ECONOMY IS SMALL HE

22
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:33,121
WERE THE ECONOMY OF TEXAS.

23
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,522
IT'S A COUNTRY THAT COULD BARELY

24
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:37,425
PRODUCE A WORKING ESCALATOR OR

25
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:40,061
NONPOISONING VODKA.

26
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:41,863
IT'S SAD AND INCREASINGLY

27
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:43,164
IRRELEVANT IS ACCORDING TO

28
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:45,566
DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON IN

29
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,300
VIRTUALLY COMPLETE CONTROL OF

30
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,236
THE WORKINGS OF THE U.S.

31
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:48,770
GOVERNMENT.

32
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,504
THEY TELL US THAT EVERY DAY AND

33
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,072
THEY'RE STARTING TO SEEM LIKE

34
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,273
THEY BELIEVE IT.

35
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:54,342
THAT'S DEMENTED.

36
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,244
MOST STRIKING EXAMPLE COMES FROM

37
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:58,446
FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

38
00:00:58,446 --> 00:00:59,247
INTELLIGENCE JIM CLAPPER.

39
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,682
IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY,

40
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,384
CLAPPER SAID THAT RUSSIA FLIPPED

41
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:04,218
TO THE RESULTS OF THE 2016

42
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:06,454
ELECTION, GOT TRUMP ELECTED OVER

43
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:06,788
HILLARY.

44
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:08,056
AS FOR EVIDENCE OF THAT, CLAPPER

45
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,525
ADMITTED HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

46
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:11,259
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, HE DOESN'T

47
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,061
HAVE ANY!

48
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:14,295
NO ONE ELSE HAS ANY EITHER!

49
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,730
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY

50
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,565
FOREIGN COUNTRY CHANGED A SINGLE

51
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:18,166
AMERICAN VOTE IN 2016.

52
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,834
BY THE WAY, THAT WAS CLAPPER'S

53
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:20,902
POSITION JUST TWO YEARS AGO WHEN

54
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:23,604
IT WAS THE POSITION OF THE OBAMA

55
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:24,372
ADMINISTRATION THAT VOTE

56
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:27,508
TAMPERING BY A FOREIGN POWER WAS

57
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:28,409
COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE AND

58
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,144
IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE.

59
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:31,813
NOW THAT TRUMP IS IN OFFICE, OF

60
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:32,980
COURSE, CLAPPER AND OTHER

61
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,681
DEMOCRATS ARE WARNING THAT

62
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,350
RUSSIA WILL TRY TO SUBVERT THIS

63
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,951
YEAR'S MIDTERM AS WELL.

64
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:38,886
THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THAT

65
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:39,220
EITHER.

66
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,822
NOW, KEEP IN MIND THAT JIM

67
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:43,291
CLAPPER IS NOT SOME FRINGE RADIO

68
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,525
SHOW HOST OR BACK BENCHER IN

69
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:44,892
CONGRESS.

70
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:46,627
FOR YEARS, HE HELD ONE OF THE

71
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:48,396
TOP INTELLIGENCE POSTS IN THE

72
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:50,398
COUNTRY, YET HE'S DELUSIONAL.

73
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:50,898
THAT'S TERRIFYING.

74
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:52,533
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY

75
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,035
DELUSIONSNAL ONE.

76
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:56,838
THE CIA OPERATIVES SPYING ON THE

77
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:57,905
TRUMP CAMPAIGN SOUND LIKE HE'S

78
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:58,406
UNBALANCED.

79
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:00,575
REPORT TODAY FROM THE DAILY

80
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:01,642
CALLER FINDS THAT THAT MAN

81
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:04,178
ONCELY ACCUSED A RUSSIAN

82
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:05,313
ACADEMIC IN CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY

83
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:11,152
OF BEING A RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE.

84
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,688
THIS AFTERNOON, CONGRESSIONAL

85
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:14,422

BRIEFING FROM DOJ AND INTEL

87
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:17,792
OFFICIALS ABOUT ACTUAL SPYING

88
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,561
THAT TOOK PLACE IN 2016, NOT

89
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:22,497
SPYING FROM SPOOKY RUSSIAN

90
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:23,931
AGENTS SENT FROM THE KREMLIN BUT

91
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:26,768
FROM THE OBAMA F.B.I.

92
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,669
THAT MIGHT PUT SOME OF THIS IN

93
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:32,406
PERSPECTIVE.

94
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:34,375
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US NOW.

95
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,676
I NIGHT START WITH AN IMMEDIATE

96
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:37,044
QUESTION BUT IT DETERMINES HOW

97
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:37,912
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS STORY,

98
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,247
WHAT THEY READ AND SEE ON

99
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:40,014
TELEVISION.

100
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:41,716
THERE'S STILL NEWS OUTLETS AS OF

101
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:43,484
TONIGHT THAT ARE PRETENDING LIKE

102
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,787
THERE WAS NO SPYING ON THE TRUMP

103
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:46,154
CAMPAIGN.

104
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:46,888
CAN YOU JUST SAY DEFINITIVELY,

105
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:49,190
DO WE KNOW AS A FACTUAL MATTER

106
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,691
THAT THE OBAMA F.B.I. SPIED ON

107
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:53,094
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, OR DON'T WE?

108
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:53,795
>> EVERYONE KNOWS THERE WAS A

109
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:55,096
SPY AND IN FACT PEOPLE WHO WERE

110
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:56,831
INVOLVED IN THE SPYING ARE

111
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:57,665
ADMITTING THERE WAS A SPY.

112
00:02:57,665 --> 00:03:00,234
THEY'RE SAYING, THOUGH, BECAUSE

113
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,436
THE GOVERNMENT TERM IS "HUMAN

114
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:03,104
INTELLIGENCE INFORMANT" OR

115
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:04,205
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT

116
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,307
THEREFORE IT'S NOT A SPY WHEREAS

117
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:07,041
NORMAL AMERICANS UNDERSTAND WHEN

118
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,410
YOU'RE GATHERING INFORMATION ON

119
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,379
SOMEONE SURREPTITIOUSLY, THAT'S

120
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,146
THE COMMON DEFINITION OF SPYING.

121
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:14,048
MORE THAN THAT, THAT'S JUST A

122
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,082
STUNNING REVELATION THIS IS

123
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:15,783
HAPPENING UNDER THE PREVIOUS

124
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:16,584
ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE WOULD

125
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,219
BE THIS KIND OF SURVEILLANCE,

126
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,055
NOT JUST AT LEAST ONE HUMAN

127
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:22,523
INTELLIGENCE INFORMANT BUT ALSO

128
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:23,991
WIRE TAPS, NATIONAL SECURITY

129
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,393
LETTERS WHICH IS HOW COULD YOU

130
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:27,328
SECRETLY GET A SUBPOENA AND WHO

131
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,463
KNOWS WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?

132
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:30,665
ACTUALLY LIKE WIDESPREAD SPYING

133
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:31,465
INVOLVING MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN THE

134
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:32,600
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND WE STILL

135
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,568
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING

136
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,436
ON BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO

137
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:35,803
FIGHT --

138
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:36,737
>> Tucker: THAT'S THE POINT.

139
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:38,206
I SHOULD POINT OUT IN THE

140
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,808
INTEREST OF HONESTY THESE ARE

141
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:41,542
AGENCIES CONTROLLED BY THE TRUMP

142
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:41,943
WHITE HOUSE.

143
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:43,144
IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME AT ALL WHY

144
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:46,747
WE DON'T KNOW THIS AND WHY THE

145
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,049
COMMITTEES IN CONGRESS WHO HAVE

146
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:48,783
OVERSIGHT OVER ALL THIS DON'T

147
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:49,083
KNOW.

148
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,017
THERE WAS A MEETING TODAY

149
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:51,586
FAMOUSLY ABOUT THIS, TOM.

150
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:53,387
DO YOU THINK MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

151
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:55,990
WILL GET CHARMED OF OVERSIGHT OF

152
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,226
THIS STUFF KNOW THE ANSWER AS OF

153
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:58,926
TONIGHT?

154
00:03:58,926 --> 00:03:59,794
>> THEY'RE BEING STRUNG ALONG.

155
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:01,596
THIS MEETING WAS FOR SHOW.

156
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,064
WE WANT TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS.

157
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:04,866
>> Tucker: WHY WOULD THEY BE

158
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,400
STRUNG ALONG?

159
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,835
>> THESE AGENCIES HAVE CONTEMPT

160
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:09,270
FOR CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT.

161
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,705
YOU HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY

162
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:11,439
SITUATION OF A

163
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,206
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED JUSTICE

164
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,508
DEPARTMENT AND F.B.I. ATTACKING

165
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,711
AND UNDERMINING THE

166
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:17,310
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT

167
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,045
ACTIVITIES OF A

168
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:20,281
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE AND

169
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,382
SENATE, AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO

170
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:23,517
TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS, SO SOON

171
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:24,552
WE'LL HAVE A MEETING.

172
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,320
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE SECRET SPY

173
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,455
GAME WE HAD, BUT IT WON'T BE

174
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:28,422
PUBLIC.

175
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:30,324
WE WON'T TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE

176
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:30,958
IN TERMS OF TURNING OVER

177
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,193
DOCUMENTS, WHICH IS STILL THE

178
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:33,928
BIG FIGHT.

179
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:34,962
NOW, JUDICIAL WATCH SPECIAL EYES

180
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:36,564
AND FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,

181
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,366
BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE

182
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,367
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS REALLY TELL

183
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,968
WHAT YOU WENT ON, AND GOVERNMENT

184
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:41,769
OFFICIAL DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT

185
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:44,505
WENT ON AS WE'RE LEARNING FROM

186
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:47,308
THE OBAMA GANG THAT IS

187
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:48,609
DESCRIBING THIS SPY AS AN

188
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,979
INFORMANT AND IN A DISHONEST

189
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:52,914
WAY, WE NEED TO SEE THE

190
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:53,281
DOCUMENTS.

191
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:55,616
WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY

192
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:56,417
WAS THIS PERSON PAID?

193
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,152
WAS MONEY TRANSFERRED AS A

194
00:04:58,152 --> 00:04:59,253
RESULT OF HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH

195
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:03,925
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?

196
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,726
WHO ELSE WAS HE WORKING WITH?

197
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:06,227
WERE THERE OTHERS?

198
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:08,229
>> Tucker: THERE'S A TIME

199
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:08,629
LIMIT HERE.

200
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,164
SAND IS PASSING THROUGH THE HOUR

201
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:10,698
GLASS HERE.

202
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,300
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE HOUSE AND

203
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,935
TAKE MAJORITY CONTROL OF THESE

204
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,436
COMMITTEES, THEN HOW WILL WE

205
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:16,504
FIND OUT?

206
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:17,738
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN GETTING

207
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:18,506
THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC.

208
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,674
>> THAT'S WHY IT'LL BE NICE IF

209
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:24,378
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WOULD

210
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:25,713
UNDERSTAND THAT SPYING IS NOT

211
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:26,480
GOOD FOR HAVING AMERICANS HAVE

212
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,415
CONFIDENCE IN THE F.B.I.

213
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,150
>> Tucker: HAVE YOU HEARD

214
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,418
LIBERALS SAY THAT?

215
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,954
>> THERE'S BEEN A FEW,

216
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:34,021
EXCEEDINGLY FEW.

217
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,389
MARK PENN IS ONE THAT'S BEEN

218
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,857
MAKING THAT ARGUMENT.

219
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:42,263
IN ADDITION THAT THE -- IS

220
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,831
ACCOUNTABLE TO NO ONE, I THINK

221
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:45,633
IT MUST MEAN THE INFORMATION IS

222
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:47,335
REALLY DAMAGING, REALLY

223
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:48,769
DANGEROUS, BUT THEY'RE WILLING

224
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,471
TO SUBVERT ANY AUTHORITY IN

225
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,306
ORDER TO KEEP THAT A SECRET.

226
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,008
SO THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK

227
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:54,842
THEY THINK THEY CAN KEEP THIS

228
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:55,676
FROM GETTING OUT.

229
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:56,577
I DON'T THINK THEY WILL ACTUALLY

230
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:56,911
DO THAT.

231
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:59,146
>> Tucker: IN THE PRETEXT THEY

232
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,047
USED TO HIDE THIS INFORMATION

233
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,916
FROM PUBLIC VIEW ARE DISHONEST.

234
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,418
TONIGHT, REPORTER IN WASHINGTON

235
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:06,253
HAS A PIECE EXPLAINING THAT ONE

236
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,088
OF THE MANY FACTS REDACTED BY

237
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:11,325
THE F.B.I. IN DOCUMENTSA

238
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,995
OBTAINED THROUGH FOYA REVEALS

239
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,529
ANDY MCCABE SPENT $70,000 ON A

240
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:16,530
PIECE OF OFFICE FURNITURE.

241
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,999
THEY HELD THAT BACK ON GROUNDS

242
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:18,933
OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

243
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,368
DOES THAT IMPERIL US, TOM, AS A

244
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:22,603
COUNTRY NOW THAT OUR ENEMIES

245
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:24,872
KNOW THAT ANDY MCCABE SPENT

246
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:27,141
$70,000 ON A PIECE OF OFFICE

247
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:27,508
FURNITURE?

248
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:28,642
>> OF COURSE IT DOESN'T IT SHOWS

249
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:30,344
YOU THE FBI AND THE DEPARTMENT

250
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:32,947
OF JUSTICE CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO

251
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:33,848
EVALUATE FAIRLY WHETHER

252
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:34,949
DOCUMENTS SHOULD BE RELEASED OR

253
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:35,216
NOT.

254
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,984
AND THE PRESIDENT WHO

255
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:37,752
CONSTITUTIONALLY RUNS THE

256
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:38,686
AGENCIES NEEDS INTERVENE AND

257
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,054
STOP BEING -- AND STOP HIMSELF

258
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:43,391
FROM BEING STRUNG ALONG BY HIS

259
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,493
APPOINTEES AND TELL THEM TO

260
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,294
RELEASE THESE RECORDS.

261
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:47,862
REVIEW THEM QUICKLY.

262
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,363
>> Tucker: NEVER LISTEN TO

263
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:49,797
YOUR LAWYERS.

264
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,198
IF THERE'S ONE PIECE OF ADVICE I

265
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,433
HAVE FOR MY CHILDREN IS DON'T

266
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,234
LISTEN TO YOUR LAWYERS BECAUSE

267
00:06:53,234 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON'T HAVE THE TRUTH AT
