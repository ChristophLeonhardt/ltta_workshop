Puerto Rico continues to struggle without power as much as 80% of Puerto Ricans still have no access to power following Hurricane Maria and something interesting happened the state-owned power authority in Puerto Rico decided to grant a 300 million dollar contract to a tiny tiny utility company that's only been around for two years and when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico this company only had two employees but if you do a little digging you find out who is behind this utility company and the cozy ties it has to the Trump administration now they just say before you give in to those details this two-person company now presumably they've hired more staff but at the time when the hurricane said they have two people they are supposed to bring back power and electricity to more than three million people in Puerto Rico let me get their dog dog like you got to give me a chance okay it's like there's no other explanation other than the fact that they are donors and connected wouldn't I tell you before we started this story I have juicy tidbits shook y'all had tidbits let me get to the tidbits all right so the name of this tiny utility company is known as white fish energy holdings and it has had again reported only two full-time employees right before hurricane Maria hit right now they have hired a bunch of subcontractors ever since they've gotten this deal with the Puerto Rican with Puerto Rican politicians basically it had a staff of only two full-time employees and it also appears in equipped to handle restoring electricity to Puerto Rico's more than three million residents now they have done smaller jobs in the past they had previously received a federal contract to the tune of about three million dollars but so far this is the largest contract that they've received and keep in mind that the power authority in Puerto Rico is dealing with a nine billion dollar debt so it was a really questionable decision for them to go ahead and hire this tiny utility company that a seems ill-equipped and be is incredibly expensive again 300 million dollars now the private equity firm that finances Whitefish known as HBC investments was founded by a man by the name of Joe : Etta who contributed $20,000 to the Trump victory PAC during the general election other contributions that : Etta made include $2,700 to Trump's primary election campaign which by the way was the maximum amount of money that he was legally able to donate $2,700 to Trump's general election campaign and also 30,000 $700 to the Republican National Committee in 2016 alone so he is a huge Republican donor but more importantly he is a huge supporter of Trump and his administration in fact Whitefish Energy Holdings is based in Whitefish Montana which is the hometown of Ryan's inky a member of trumps administration Whitefish chief executive officer and e-tech manske is friends with trump's administration interior secretary ryan's inky as I mentioned you also have to keep in mind that there are other ties to trump's administration including a clone Netta's wife who has also donated a considerable amount of money to the Republican Party now whitefish seems to be nothing more than a glorified middleman to get the real providers of the services with which the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority could have contracted directly this is according to Luis Vega Ramos who is in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives he also says that it is a cozy sweetheart deal in which white fish gets a gratuity for subcontracting the actual providers so what he means by that is this tiny utility company again for the billionth time only has two full-time employees so what they did is they subcontracted hundreds of people that are now going to work on restoring the power grid in Puerto Rico but three hundred million dollars seems like a lot of money especially when it comes to a power Authority that again is in a lot of debt nine billion dollars to be exact to tell you why this is going to cost so much money you have to look at what they're charging Puerto Rico for you know the restoration of their power grid so under the contract this is under the contract which means there's nothing hidden they knew this they signed on to this they are charging 300 $30 an hour for a site supervisor they're also charging 462 dollars an hour for a sub contracted supervisor okay for a subcontractor of a subcontractor of a supervisor of a supervisor that's going to cost thousands of dollars an hour it gets worse it gets worse they are also charging three hundred thirty two dollars a night a night for accommodation fees for every employee contracted by Whitefish and finally $80 a day for food $80 a day for if I don't spend $80 a day on food that is absurd okay so again these are hundreds of individuals that are being subcontracted and each one of them are going to get paid hundreds of dollars an hour to help to restore Puerto Rico's power grid and then finally were there other options yes there were other options yes so Florida and Texas did something known as the the mutual aid arrangement where other utility companies throughout the country you know pitch in and they help and that is the best way to restore the power in a fast or a quick fashion right and for some reason the Power Authority in Puerto Rico did not respond to any of these utility companies that offered to help which is a curious decision to make instead they decided to grant this 300 million dollar contract to a tiny utility company okay so how and why did this go down so first of all normally FEMA and the US Army Corps of Engineers make these decisions about how to rebuild but when they were asked about it and Daily Beast had a great report on this they're like up from our own talk about Whitefish okay Whitefish what name so so obviously they're like don't touch that with a ten-foot pole because we know what happened there and you talk about it you're gonna be in trouble and if you say you did it you're gonna be in bigger trouble right so this colon and a guy donated a total of 74 thousand dollars to Trump's presidential victory and then of course his wife is and explained has given to trump and two other Republicans as well but he's the guy who owns the investment company and seventy four thousand dollars will get you some money and politicians are cheap and so you can give seventy four thousand and get three hundred million dollars back that's why they do the legalized bribery and if you're a business person and you're not doing legalized bribery your competition probably is that's why this system of allowing private financing of elections is insane they're robbing us blind in every direction this is just one that we have any catch but there is a second element to it now you mentioned the relationship with Ryan Ziggy the actual CEO of the company itself not the company that invested in in white fish but the white fish CEO he's really good friends with Ryan Zinke and is literally from the same neck of the woods in Montana as zing Kias yes that's a coincidence no it's not you want to know the taint and name of the town that Ryan's think he grew up in white fish yes and the amazing thing is look Zinke has responded to the criticism in the media right now and he's saying no no we never even took up a meeting nothing to do with this not buying it not buying it and and for those of you who are wondering okay there's a little bit of a disconnect because we're talking about Puerto Rico's power Authority you know essentially agreeing to this 300 million dollar contract what does that have to do with the federal government well these type of contracts are approved by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA and they refuse to really give the media any answers in regard to this story but yeah the federal government is obviously involved in this and it's going to unfortunately dig Puerto Rico in an even deeper hole when it comes to their you know economic situation so first of all wolf dash pack.com I get money out of politics otherwise it's gonna happen day in day out second of all what do we tell you we told you Trump was gonna make the swamp even worse and the guy who's the interior secretary I guess it's fitting besides hey you know what Washington is swampy enough let me do some interior secretary around here and make it a bigger swamp oh my friend who has a company of two people can rebuild all the Puerto Rico's electricity of course here here's 300 million dollars like I grew up in East Brunswick New Jersey if I'm the interior secretary and all of a sudden one of my best friends who grew up with me who started a company called East preser incorporated hundred million dollar contract and it's him and his brother Bob okay yeah that's obviously fishy if you will whitefish II of course its corruption of course this is what crony capitalism looks like and as Puerto Rico was in all this trouble and needed help did they look to figure out how they can help them no they look to see how can we rob them blind exactly and and they got flooded you know what let's add a swamp on top and that's what Ryan's inky and Donald Trump are all about if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch
