well last week he did something next but it was unforgivable he tweeted seven words I love the way Candace Owens thinks that's it that's all he said who's Candace Owens well we have interviewed her before at least once that I can recall here's a quick clip from when I bumped into her at CPAC a conference in Washington a few months ago I just want to apologize the Canadian people for having Justin Trudeau I don't know how you guys doing with that oh we call that a female president over here yeah absolutely awful and embarrassing and and by the way it's mankind bright conservative modern brave young gal free thinker what's not to like and Kanye West said he liked how she thought now he didn't even say that he agreed with her he just said he enjoyed listening to her because she said things well like this and I can I can tell you right now who is going to be better off when you will you look 20 years I mean look at the faces in this room who's gonna be better off are the girls that are sitting right here and across this room because they don't have your mentality victim mentality is not cool I don't know why people like being oppressed so weirdest thing I've ever heard I love oppression but we're oppressed 400 years of slavery Jim Crow which by the way none of you guys lived through your grandparents didn't it's embarrassing that you utilize you utilize their history you utilize their history and you come in here with more emotion than ever had when they were living through it more emotion than they ever had when they were living through it's embarrassing you're not living through anything right now you're overly privileged Americans well my god if you thought Shania Twain committed a thought crime well this was a capital offense because Shania Twain was just a woman just a Canadian Kanye West is black he speaks to the black experience it's not just black he's at the heart of successful black music his wife is the top of the Instagram food chain Kim Kardashian Kanye West is going rogue he's switching signs well I mean he's dabbled with Republicans before he had hard words for Bush but he and Donald Trump seemed to get along just fine there is meeting with him at Trump Tower in New York like so many people in Hollywood used to do until Trump became president the freaked out about Kanye West Was total it was hysterical it was mad it was flecked here's the official Twitter response and by that I mean the company Twitter itself which made this an official Twitter moment that they pumped out to every Twitter user 300 million of them here's how they described it they said Kanye says he likes the way far-right media personality Candace Owens thinks far-right I've met Candace she's not far right she's to my left she center-right she's thoughtful she's creative and you know Twitter is an expert in Kenna so-and-so because they couldn't even spell her name right about oh the backlash the outrage but Kanye you know he's built for that a bit a bit more than Shania Twain instead of groveling Kanye West doubled down and then again he said the thought police want to suppress freedom of thought oh my god he's talking about free speech and look at this one about the mindset and Candice's mindset and about being black he said there was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us but now it's a mentality oh boy that's just like kinda swung herself is let's and then this one self victimization is a disease Wow and by the way he did about 20 of those the media don't know what to do with him he stopped behaving himself he's supposed to be a good Democrat that's what the left thinks if you're a woman if you're gay if you're black if you're young definitely if you're a celebrity you have to be a leftist that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
