Russia's Investigative Committee has rejected claims of a Russian state-sponsored doping program it said that the world anti-doping agency had provided no proof of the allegations made in a report by Canadian lawyer Richard McClaren let's get details now artis Murad caste F joining us here live on the program good to see you Murata the committee what else has the committee had to say well this has been an exhaustive study they questioned more than 700 athletes as well as their coaches various medical personnel on these allegations and they actually addressed specific allegations the first being that samples were switched they rejected that they say that the McLaren report says that athletes positive samples positive drug samples were switched with negative ones by way of adding salt and distilled water to the urine samples and this way any banned substances in them were undetectable basically and the russians said that these samples couldn't have been positive because once you study them once you look at their consistency once you look at their makeup while any any one thing could make them an anomalous result for example if an athlete rained hard then he drank something depending on the volume and what he drank the result could be called anomalous which is what the McLaren report called many of these samples the next allegation that was rejected was that the bottles themselves were opened the Swiss firm that makes these bottles markets them as tamper proof and the Russians after experimenting with them said that while they found that if you tamper with these bottles you can't you can't open them and close them without damaging or destroying their integrity so basically you'll leave a mark any way you look at it the other allegation serious allegation was that there was a huge doping program a state-sponsored mass doping program and again though 700 athletes and coaches and medical personnel that they questioned none of them at mitad to a mass doping program Russians say that while there may have been individual individual violations individual use of banned substance there was no state-sponsored doping program and the McLaren report has no evidence of a mass state-sponsored doping program more than that though they the prosecutors are also in possession of a phone call between McGorry Raj snick of he was the disgrace now disgraced head of rusada the Russian anti-doping agency during which he called the current head of the anti-doping agency and offered money for a database of for a database of athletes results doping results he offered money as well as US citizenship and amnesty Stalinist it was concluded that watching cough who is now in the US and works with Professor McLaren telephoned former rusada had and asked her to sell him the database of Russian athletes test results the former rusada had told Russian investigators about this and now the committee has records of their conversations this all of course after two Russian athletes skiers were banned for life from competing in the Olympics after they were found guilty of using banned substances although questions here arise as well because these the investigation itself is still ongoing yet athletes are already being banned for life all right artis my dad gasps dear there thank you
