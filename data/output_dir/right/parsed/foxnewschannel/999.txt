POINT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS
IT'S ON THE PATH OF BEING
IRREVERSIBLE.
>> Dana: THANKS, JOHN.
HAVE A SAFE TRIP HOME.
JOINING US NOW, SUE MI TERRY, AN
ANALYST ON THE KOREAN ISSUES FOR
THE CIA.
SHE'S HERE FOR NO POLITICS, JUST
SUBSTANCE.
TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORICAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS MOMENT?
>> IT'S HISTORICALLY
SIGNIFICANT, THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT
SAT DOWN WITH A NORTH KOREAN
LEADER FACE TO FACE.
WE NEVER HAD THAT.
OTHER TIMES NORTH KOREAN LEADERS
WANTED THIS, BUT OTHER --
PRESIDENT BUSH AND OBAMA DIDN'T
WANT TO DO THAT.
SO THIS IS HISTORIC.
REGARDLESS OF WHAT OCCURRED.
THIS MOMENT IS -- WHAT WE
WITNESSED YESTERDAY IS A
HISTORIC MOMENT.
>> Dana: YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT KIM JONG-UN AND THE
CULTURE.
YOU MENTIONED IN A PIECE TODAY
THAT HE SHOWED DEFERENCE TO HIS
OTHER COUNTERPART.
HOW SO?
>> HE'S BEING VERY CORDIAL.
IN KOREAN LANGUAGE, THERE'S
FORMAL AND INFORMAL LANGUAGE.
HE USED FORMAL LANGUAGE WHEN
ADDRESSING PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HIS BODY LANGUAGE, HE DIDN'T
HAVE AN ALTITUDE.
HE TRIED TO GIVE RESPECT TO
TRUMP.
>> Dana: WHAT DO YOU THINK STATE
TV WANTS THOSE CITIZENS TO SEE?
>> WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE
ALL THE THINGS THAT KIM JONG-UN
WAS DOING, RUNNING AROUND
SINGAPORE, TAKING A SELFIE.
YOU KNOW THE NORTH KOREAN MEDIA
WAS WITH HIM.
THE WAY THEY'RE GOING TO SPIN
IT, NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR
PROGRAM IS COMPLETED AND NOW THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS
ACCEPTING HIM.
NOW YOU CAN SIT DOWN WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE MOST
POWERFUL PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD.
WHY?
BECAUSE KIM JONG-UN IS A BOLD
LEADER THAT GETS HERE BECAUSE --
>> Dana: THEY KNOW IT'S BECAUSE
KIM JONG-UN HAS SAID THAT HE
WOULD DENUCLEARIZE?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL KNOW
THAT.
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW, WE,
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH
KOREA, ARE GOING TO TRY TO
IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP AND TRY
TO GET TO ANOTHER LEVEL.
BUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
IS THAT NOW BECAUSE NORTH KOREA
COMPLETED THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM,
THEY'RE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH
THE U.S. PRESIDENT AND NEGOTIATE
FROM POSITION OF STRENGTH.
>> THEY'RE EQUALS.
>> THAT'S THEIR NARRATIVE.
>> Dana: TELL ME GOING FORWARD.
WE KNOW JOHN BOLTON WILL BE
GOING OVER IN ABOUT A MONTH AND
WORK ON THE NITTY GRITTY WITH
MIKE POMPEO.
THEY'LL HAVE TO BE TOUGHER, I
ASSUME?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THIS JOINT STATEMENT, IT WAS
LARGELY ASPIRATIONAL.
DIDN'T ADDRESS AT ALL NORTH
KOREA
>> Sandra: TAKE A LISTEN TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY AT THE SUMMIT.
>> I BELIEVE IT'S A ROUGH
SITUATION OVER THERE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
WE DID DISCUSS IT TODAY.
PRETTY STRONGLY.
KNOWING WHAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF
WHAT WE WERE DOING IS, DENUKING.
BUT DISCUSSED IT AT GOOD LENGTH.
WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING ON IT.
>> Sandra: THIS WON'T BE A
SURPRISE TO YOU.
THE HUNGER CRISIS IN NORTH
KOREA.
18 MILLION PEOPLE ARE DEPENDENT
ON GOVERNMENT FOOD RATIONS.
10.5 MILLION ARE BELIEVED TO BE
UNDERNOURISHED.
I MEAN, IN ANY WAY, DO YOU THINK
THAT KIM JONG-UN GETTING A TASTE
OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE TO BE A
NORMALIZED LEADER IN A WORLD
THAT HE MIGHT TREAT HIS PEOPLE
BETTER?
>> I'M SKEPTICAL ON THAT.
I'M HOPEFUL.
I FEEL LIKE THAT IS SOMETHING
THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE
FUTURE.
YEAH, HE WANTS TO IMPROVE THE
ECONOMY FOR NORTH KOREA.
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A
RULER OF A POOR STATE.
JUST FOR HIMSELF,
SELF-INTEREST-WISE.
I'M SKEPTICAL THAT HE WILL OPEN
THE PRISON CAMPS THAT HAS
ALL OF A SUDDEN TAKE CARE OF THE
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.
I'M SKEPTICAL OF THAT.
NORTH KOREA SPENDS BILLIONS
PURSUING THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
WHILE WATCHING THEIR PEOPLE
STARVE.
IN THE 90s, THEY SPENT $800
MILLION BUILDING A MAUSOLEUM FOR
KIM JONG-UN.
PEOPLE LITERALLY DYING AND
STARVING.
SO MAYBE -- KIM JONG-UN DOES
WANT TO I THINK IMPROVE HIS
ECONOMY BUT TO SAY HE'S GOING TO
CHANGE THE HUMAN RIGHTS
SITUATION AROUND --
>> Sandra: CAN I ASK ONE LAST
QUESTION?
AT THE END OF THE SUMMIT, YOU
THINK THE UNITED STATES AND THE
WORLD IS SAFER THAN IT WAS
BEFORE?
>> I DO THINK SO.
JUST BECAUSE IT'S BETTER THAN
TALKING ABOUT PREVENTATIVE
STRIKE AND BLOODY NOSE.
WHILE IT'S NOT IDEAL, IT'S A
FLAWED STATEMENT BECAUSE IT WAS
A VERY ASPIRATIONAL AND NORTH
KOREANS COULD HAVE GIVEN US
MORE.
BUT THIS IS STILL BETTER TODAY
THAN WHERE WE WERE A FEW WEEKS
