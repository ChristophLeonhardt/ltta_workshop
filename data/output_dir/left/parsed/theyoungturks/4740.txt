IF YOU THOUGHT THAT THE
REPUBLICANS WERE NOT DOING
ANYTHING ABOUT THE OPIATE CRISIS
IN AMERICA, THINK AGAIN.
THEY ARE ACTUALLY PLANNING
SOMETHING MASSIVE.
A MASSIVE CUT IN FEDERAL FUNDING
FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE ACROSS
THE COUNTRY WHICH SHOWS THAT
THEY CLEARLY WERE PAYING
ATTENTION TO NATIONAL ISSUES
DURING THE LAST ELECTION.
THIS WILL ACTUALLY COME ABOUT AS
A NICE LITTLE SIDE EFFECT
OF THE AHCA PLAN, TRUMPCARE,
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
THE CUTS WOULD BE MADE TO
MEDICAID EXPANSION THAT
HAVE BEEN ONGOING SINCE THE ACA
WAS PUT INTO EFFECT.
THE GOP HEALTH CARE BILL WITHIN
THE EXTRA FUNDING STATES
GET THEIR EXPANDING MEDICAID IN
2020, AND PLACE A LIMIT ON
OVERALL FEDERAL SPENDING FOR THE
PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE.
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS,
WE'VE CITED THIS BEFORE AND
WE WILL AGAIN, THAT THE CBO
ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY
14 MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE
THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE
BECAUSE THEY GOT IT THROUGH THAT
PROCESS THAT WOULD BE ENDED.
THAT OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS EVERY
AREA OF THOSE PEOPLE'S
HEALTH INSURANCE BUT ONE AREA
THAT DOESN'T GET TALKED
ABOUT NEARLY AS MUCH IS THE
MEDICAID INFLUENCE ON
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT,
INCLUDING SOME OF THE MOST
DEADLY SUBSTANCES, THE OPIOIDS.
THE MEDICARE EXPANSION
ACCOUNTED FOR OVER 60%
ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN
KENTUCKY, NEARLY HALF IN WEST
VIRGINIA, NEARLY 60% IN
MICHIGAN AND MARYLAND AND ALMOST
A THIRD IN RHODE ISLAND.
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE PEOPLE GOT
YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE IN
THOSE STATES AND MANY OTHERS,
THROUGH THE MEDICAID
EXPANSION UNDER THE ACA, YOU
COULD FIND THAT ONCE TRUMPCARE
GETS PASSED, YOU SUDDENLY DON'T
HAVE THAT MONEY AND THAT IS
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THE SUBSTANCE
ABUSE TREATMENT IS NOT CHEAP.
ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT,
OUTPATIENT OPIOID ADDICTION
TREATMENT THAT INCLUDES
MEDICATION LIKE METHADONE
AVERAGES BETWEEN SIX AND $8000
A YEAR AND IF YOU ARE PAYING
OUT OF POCKET AND USING THE MOST
EFFECTIVE MEDICINES WHICH
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE, YOU WILL
PAY FAR MORE AND THAT MEANS
THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT GET THE
TREATMENT OF THEIR GETTING
RIGHT NOW WHICH MEANS THAT WE
WILL HAVE MORE DEATHS.
CLICKS ON THE UPSIDE, ON THE
FLIPSIDE NOT THE UPSIDE,
MANY PEOPLE WITH HAIR WHEN
ADDICTIONS ARE QUITE
WELL-OFF, SO THEY WILL BE FINE
I GUESS DOUG LIKES THIS
WOULD'VE BEEN BAD NEWS FOR RUSH
LIMBAUGH I GUESS.
HE WILL PROBABLY BE OKAY
WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT'S
PART OF HIS CONTRACT
IS GOOD THAT WE FINALLY GET
SOME DETAILS BECAUSE LOOK,
THESE GUYS, AS I HAVE SAID AND
YOU GUYS AGREE, AND I THINK
EVERYBODY PAYING ATTENTION,
THESE GUYS ARE NOT
INTERESTED IN GOVERNING.
I
SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, THEY
ARE INTERESTED IN UNDOING
GOVERNMENT.
INITIALLY, TRUMP PROPOSED THAT
AFTER RUNNING SOME OF HIS
CAMPAIGN ON HOW HE WOULD FIGHT
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WHICH
IS SORT OF ODDLY BECAME, OR
SURPRISINGLY, AND WELCOMELY.
BECAME A CAMPAIGN ISSUE
THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND
BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD TRUMP
EVEN ADDRESSED THE
AND KASICH AS WELL.
IT BECAME AN ISSUE THAT A
NUMBER OF CANDIDATES
ADDRESSED IT, AND TRUMP AND JOHN
KASICH AS WELL.
WHERE THEY SAID IT IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE IT'S A
BIG ISSUE.
ADMINISTRATION WAS INITIALLY
GOING TO DO A 95% CUT.
IT'S NOT, ONE OF THE EARLY CUTS.
TOTALLY DEFUNDING A FEDERAL
DRUG CONTROL OFFICE IN THE
MIDDLE OF A NATIONWIDE OPIOID
EPIDEMIC.
THERE WAS OUTCRY FROM MANY
REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS,
INCLUDING SOME FEDERAL
REPUBLICANS AND EVERY
DEMOCRAT COMPLAINING AND THEN
THEY BACKPEDALED AND THEY
ENDED UP PROPOSING 369 MILLION
FOR THE OFFICE.
IT IS NOT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF
BEING ABLE TO FIGHT OPIOID
EPIDEMIC, BUT IS A CENTRAL
OFFICE WHICH CAN COORDINATE
AND IF DONE RIGHT WOULD BE
USEFUL, SO THEY END UP
BACKPEDALING OFF THEIR 95% CUT
WINCHESTER CONEY AND IN CRUEL
AND AGAIN JUST SHOWS A DESIRE,
LET'S STOP THIS DEPARTMENT.
LET'S NOT GOVERN HERE.
SO THEIR NEW PROPOSAL WAS 369
MILLION WHICH THEY MADE.
IT'S A 5% CUT.
THAT IS NOT TACKLING A PROBLEM.
THAT IS, THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC
BROKE THAT TACKLE AND
SLIPPED AWAY.
IT'S A FOOTBALL REFERENCE, JOHN.
THEY ARE GOING INTO GETTING
CREDIT TO SOME EXTENT FOR A
5% CUT IN WHAT IS CLEARLY A
NATIONAL CRISIS.
AND IT WAS SOMETHING, THESE
NUMBERS WERE OBVIOUSLY UP
TO DURING THE PREVIOUS EIGHT
YEARS TO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY
AND THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN WORSE
AND WHAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH IS
SORT OF THE CONTINUATION THAT IS
TRICKLE-DOWN TO THE CONGRESS TO.
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO SEEMS TO
STILL BE, IN MY ESTIMATION,
PASTED THAT BARACK OBAMA MADE A
BUNCH OF JOKES ABOUT HIM AT
THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS
DINNER AND IS TRYING TO
UNDO EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
IN THE EIGHT YEARS OF THE
OBAMA PRESIDENCY.
I THINK A LOT OF THE WEIGHT OF
THE CONGRESS IS RUNNING IS
THE SAME WAY.
THEY SAID NO TO WHEN IT WAS
PROPOSED ANOTHER WANT TO
UNDO WHATEVER IS THERE IN THE
WRONG PLACES.
A SAD THING IS, THE OPIATE
EPIDEMIC IS SOMETHING THAT
IS AN EPIDEMIC.
IT AFFECTS BASICALLY EVERY
SEGMENT OF THE AMERICAN
POPULATION, BUT THIS ISN'T LIKE
THE CRACK PROBLEM WHERE
REPUBLICANS CAN SORT OF TELL
THEMSELVES THAT THAT IS
JUST A PROBLEM FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
HOW MANY TRUMP VOTERS,
ENTHUSIASTIC TRUMP
SUPPORTERS, WILL BE AFFECTED BY
THIS IF THIS GOES INTO EFFECT?
POOR, WHITE CONSERVATIVES THAT
THEORETICALLY COULD USE
THEIR LOSE THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE, STAY ADDICTED
AND POSSIBLY DIE UNNECESSARILY
BECAUSE OF WHAT REPUBLICANS
ARE WORKING THEIR BUTTS OFF IN
SECRET RIGHT NOW TO ACHIEVE.
YOU SORT OF EXPECT THAT THE
OTHER SIDE IS GOING TO GET
SCREWED IN AMERICAN POLITICS BUT
WHEN THEY ARE SO ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT SCREWING THEIR OWN VOTERS,
THAT IS SORT OF PERVERSE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS TO
BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S NOT
JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE PEOPLE STAY FOCUSED ON
THAT HCA IN THE BAIT THAT IS
COMING ON IN THE CENTAGE
CENTER ARE THE ONE THAT SHOULD
BE GOING ON.
LET'S SHOW THIS CHART.
WE
SHOWED IT ORIGINALLY BUT I
WANT TO SHOW IT AGAIN.
DRUG-INDUCED DEATHS.
OPIOIDS ARE NOT THE ONLY
COMPONENT OF THAT BUT THEY
ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST COMPONENT
OF THAT.
OPIOIDS THEORETICALLY, OKAY,
THEYíRE DANGEROUS AND THEY'RE
ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME DEATHS.
BUT THE RISE, THAT IS BECAUSE OF
THE PROFIT MOTIVE AND IT IS
EASY FOR MANY PEOPLE I THINK YOU
HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THIS,
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN THEIR
IMMEDIATE FAMILY WHO HAS
EITHER COME I THINK IT IS A
SHRINKING PERCENTAGE OF THE
AMERICAN POPULATION BUT THERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT
THAT AND SAY, AT THE END OF THE
DAY, IT IS NOT MARIJUANA OR
CRACK BUT IT IS STILL DRUGS AND
THESE PEOPLE THEORETICALLY
COULD'VE JUST UP DOING IT.
BUT YOU GET ON IT BECAUSE YOU
HEART YOUR BACK OR YOU HURT
YOUR LEG OR SOMETHING, AND
THEN THE HUMAN ABILITY TO
OVERCOME THAT ADDICTION, THESE
ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG,
INCREDIBLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES.
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF
WILLPOWER.
IT IS NOT PUT DOWN
THE MUFFIN.
THIS BREAKS DOWN YOUR BODY'S
ABILITY TO STOP,
WHICH BY THE WAY, I CAN'T DO
THAT.
I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT.
I HAVE NEVER HAD A DRUG LIKE
THIS, I IMAGINE I WOULD BE
ADDICTED AND THAT IS WHY YOU SEE THE
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE DYING
SHOOTING UP.
THAT IS A TREND THAT MIGHT
CONTINUE, MIGHT ACCELERATE
TRUMPCARE GETS PUT INTO LAW.
OF COURSE, WHAT THAT
NUMBER IS 60,000,
52,000 LIVES NATIONALLY.
55.
I AM READING
I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY HIRED
OUR
I'M LOOKING AT 15 NUMBERS.
I THINK IT WAS 59,000 LAST
YEAR.
60,000, AND HERE'S WHAT
HAPPENED.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T DIE BUT
THEIR LIVES WERE RUINED.
MANY MORE THAN 60,000.
NOT TO MENTION ñ
DON'T MENTION IT.
I SAID I WOULDN'T SO I WON'T.
DON AHCA STUFF, YOU
HAVE MORE ON IT BUT THE POLITICS
OF IT THAT SEEM TO GET A LITTLE
BIT MORE FAVORABLE TODAY AS A
NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS
LEAVING THEIR WEEKLY LUNCH WITH
AHAB ON CAPITOL HILL ON
TUESDAY WERE TELLING REPORTERS
THAT THERE AREN'T GUESTS
BOTH ON THIS.
MANY MORE ARE UNDECIDED THAN
THEY THOUGHT, AND ONE REPORTER
COUNTED SEVEN NO VOTES FROM
PUBLICANS ON THIS WHICH
WOULD DO IT IN AS OF RIGHT NOW.
THEY ARE NAMES YOU WOULD EXPECT.
JOHN MCCAIN SAID HE WASN'T SURE.
HE HATES THE PROCESS.
AND JOHN CORNYN, YOU WOULDN'T
EXPECT HIM, AND IN SOME OF
THE OTHER NAMES THAT COME OUT OF
THERE, SUSAN COLLINS YOU WOULD.
DEAN HELLER RUNNING FOR OFFICE
NEXT YEAR AND A BLUE STATE.
SHELLEY MOORE CAPITAL, TED CRUZ
AND MIKE LEE ARE NAMES THAT
ARE BEING SAID IS UNDECIDED THAT
ROB PORTMAN, UNDECIDED.
THESE ARE IMPRESSIVE NAMES.
I THINK THAT THE BACKLASH THAT
THEY HAVE GOTTEN FOR THE PROCESS
AND STORIES LIKE THIS AND WHAT
PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT IT
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME
PRESIDENTIAL BEDS ON
OLD-SCHOOL THIS WEEK WHICH I'M
SURE YOU BOTH WANT TO BE IN ON.
I CAN'T DO OLD-SCHOOL THIS
WEEK THAT
WILL BE CAN STILL INCLUDE
YOU.
WE WANT TO DO A DRAFT.
QUITE SALTY WITH OUR
IT IS GOING TO BE A DRAFT, I
HOPE I'M NOT GIVING TOO MUCH
AWAY, BUT A DRAFT OF THE PEOPLE
WHO MIKE PENCE WILL ASK TO
BE HIS VICE PRESIDENT, NOT ON
THE CAMPAIGN BUT WHEN HE
HAS TO APPOINT A VICE PRESIDENT.
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THAT
GAME.
I BRING UP JOHN KORMAN NOW
BECAUSE HE CAME UP AS A THOUGHT
AND THAT ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT, BUT -
I WILL JUST SIMPLY OFFER
EITHER OF YOU A VERY SIMPLE FIVE
DOLLAR BULL IF JOHN
CORNYN VOTE YES ON THIS DEAL.
ITíS INTERESTING.
I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD
PUT HIM ON THE MOST LIKELY TO
SING ON THE LIST, I WOULD THINK
HE WOULD BE IN THE BOTTOM 50%.
I CAN'T DO IT THAT
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TODAY.
NOTE THAT SO THAT IS LIKE, BUT
HE IS NOT CONFIDENT.
THIS
COULD BE FIVE DOLLARS, IF
IF VOTES NO, NOTHING IF HE VOTES
YES.
THAT IS A GOOD BET.
I WILL SAY, I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THOSE NOíS.
THAT IS GOOD NEWS.
SOME OF THEM ARE UNDECIDEDS,
NOT NOíS.
THAT IS GOOD NEWS AND IT
SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE ODDS
ARE NOT AS HIGH AS WE MIGHT'VE
THOUGHT.
NOT SAYING YOU'RE
DOING THIS, BUT I DO REMEMBER IN
THE SAME WAY I'M DOING A SOLID
TWO WEEKS OF EVERYDAY WE HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT TODAY HCA SAID PEOPLE
WILL REALIZE HOW DEVASTATING IT
WILL BE WHEN IT PASSES, BACK
WHEN THE HOUSE WAS CONSIDERING
IT FOR THE SECOND TIME, BECAUSE YOUíLL
REMEMBER IT CAME UP AND WAS KILLED
AND CAME BACK, I DID A STORY
BECAUSE WE WERE DOING A SOLID
WEEK OF IT AND THERE WAS A TYT
HOST, I AM NOT GOING TO SAY WHO,
WHO WAS ON THE PANEL AND SAID,
WHY EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS.
IT IS NOT GOING TO PASS.
WITHIN TWO DAYS, THEY SHIPPED IT
TO THE HOUSE AND IT PASSED.
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED,
YOU CAN STILL PUT PRESSURE
ON YOUR SENATORS AND TRACK
DOWN THE SEVEN THAT WERE
MENTIONED BY MICHAEL AND
HOPEFULLY STOP THIS THING.
THERE IS ALSO NO FREEDOM
CAUCUS IN THE SENATE
WHICH DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN
THE HOUSE.
THERE WAS ONE OTHER ASPECT
WHEN WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING
ABOUT THE SENATE VERSION OF THE
AHCA.
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
THAT THEY'RE GOING IN A BACK
ROOM AND PLAYING MARIO KART.
BUT WE ACTUALLY KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT
BECAUSE THEY ARE ADULTS.
ADULTS DON'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES.
WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE
INFORMATION THAT AXIAL'S
WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM.
ONE OF THE AREAS OF THE HOUSE
VERSION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD
A PROBLEM WITH AND WAS
PERVERSELY THE THING THAT GOT A
LOT OF THE CONSERVATIVES ON
BOARD WAS THE STATE WAIVERS FOR
SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS UNDER
THE ACA, THAT STATES COULD OPT
OUT OF THE THINGS ABOUT ACA THAT
MAKE IT WORTH A DAMN AND NOW WE
KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT
WILL BE IN THE SENATE VERSION,
WAIVERS ESTATES CAN GET FOR
LITTLE THINGS, LIKE PROVIDING
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS OR
THE LIST OF 10
THE SERVICES INSURERS MUST
COVER.
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WILL
NOT BE INSURED, PROBABLY
NOT THAT ESSENTIAL ANYWAY.
DO WE KNOW WHAT SOME OF THOSE
ESSENTIAL BENEFITS ARE?
YEAH, I THINK SOME OF THESE
ARE.
THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO OR THE
REGULATION OF HOW MUCH
PREMIUM INCOME INSURANCE MUST
CLAIM SIN ON PATIENT
CLAIMS, SO THEM DOING THEIR JOB
AS INSURERS TRYING TO MAKE SURE
THE PEOPLE GET MEDICAL CARE WILL
BE A LOWER PRIORITY AFTER THIS.
DAYTRADING BAND.
THIS GOING TO BE BORING, I
APOLOGIZE BUT IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT THE REQUIREMENT
THAT PREMIUMS FOR OLDER
PEOPLE BE NO MORE THAN THREE
TIMES THE PREMIUMS CHARGED
TO LIGHT YOUNGER PEOPLE WHICH I
ALWAYS LOVE WHEN YOU WENT
ON ELECTION, YOU GAIN CONTROL OF
EVERY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, AND
THEN YOU GIVE A MASSIVE MIDDLE
FINGER TO THE OLDEST VOTERS.
DO OLDER PEOPLE VOTE, I DON'T
KNOW MAYBE THEY DO.
BUT NOW THREE TIMES AS MUCH IS
ENOUGH.
OLDER PEOPLE COULD GET FIVE OR
10 TIMES AS COSTLY INSURANCE.
BILL SELF REGULATE AND KEEP
IT TO 3.
WHY RAISE A?
AND LET'S JUMP TO THIS LAST
GRAPHIC.
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HOW MUCH
YOU THEORETICALLY COULD HAVE TO
PAY FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL
PROCEDURES OR CONDITIONS UNDER
THIS NEW PLAN THAT IS BEING
CONSIDERED.
IT'S A GREAT BANNER.
YOU ARE SEEING THERE,
INTERESTINGLY, WE JUST
ABOUT DRUG DEPENDENCY.
IMAGINE HAVING TO PAY AN
ADDITIONAL $20,000
FOR THAT IF THE STATES TAKE THE
WAIVER.
SOMETHING LIKE, I DO KNOW THAT
IS, MAYBE IT IS A CANCER.
PREGNANCY, IT IS PROBABLY
BETTER, BUT IF YOU GET A
17,000 ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN
SOUP CERTAIN STATES YOU MAY
HAVE TO PAY.
THE PERSON, THAT IS A BIG
PROBLEM IN AMERICA, 10K.
THAT IS EXPENSIVE.
HEMOPHILIA, $344,000 IN CERTAIN
FORMS OF CANCER, LUNG,
BREAST, I'M SURE EVERYONE
WATCHING THIS KNOW SOMEONE
WHO IS SUFFERED FROM A FORM OF
CANCER.
MS ON TOP OF ALL OF THE OTHER
PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH
THAT, ALSO HAVING TO PAY 30 TO
8000 THOUSAND DOLLARS.
I HOPE IN THIS BILL FINALLY
GIVEN THE LIGHT OF DAY, AND
IT MAY WELL BE AFTER IT PASSES,
IT BECOMES LAW, BUT JUST
FROM A POLITICAL POINT, THAT
BREAST CANCER IS INCLUDED
IN THE THINGS THEY WON'T COVER
BUT PROSTATE CANCER IS.
THAT WOULD FIT THE PATTERN.
THAT WOULD WORK.
THEY GO TO THE CBO, THIS GOES TO
THE CBO NEXT WEEK.
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT THEY WILL CERTAINLY
LOOK AT THAT
EXACTLY.
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO TRY TO VOTE BY
THURSDAY, SO HOW MUCH TIME ARE
WE GOING TO HAVE BETWEEN
THE CBO REPORT COMING OUT, AND
THE VOTE.
A DAY MAYBE THAT
DOES A GO TO THE CBO AND THEY
BOTH THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK
WITH THE
THAT IS WHAT I HEARD THE
THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT THAT IT IS IMPORTANT
TO BEGIN THIS INFORMATION OUT
NOW, BECAUSE IF THERE IS
LESS THAN A DAY FOR PEOPLE TO
PUT PRESSURE AND AN THAT IS
WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY AWAKEN, WHEN
THEY WEEK UP TO HOW TERRIBLE
THIS BILL COULD BE, I DON'T KNOW
THE THEORETICALLY THAT'S
ENOUGH TIME TO STOP IT SO PEOPLE
NEED TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM
NOW AND THEY NEED TO NOT RELENT
UNTIL IT IS ACTUALLY KILLED.
