1
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:12,149
RIVERA, THERE HE IS.

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,883
HELLO, EVERYBODY, HELLO, MAYBE

3
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:17,421
NOT.

4
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:21,258
>> GERALDO'S BIG HAPPY BIRTHDAY,

5
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:22,659
DID YOU CELEBRATE?

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,193
>> I CERTAINLY DID.

7
00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:23,861
MY BIG SON, GABRIEL AND HIS

8
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:25,963
WIFE, DEBORAH, AND THEY LIVE IN

9
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:26,663
HOLLAND, THEY WERE FACING AN

10
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:30,467
IMMIGRATION VISA BACKLASH

11
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:34,371
BECAUSE HE WORKS IN EUROPE.

12
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:44,481
>> CRACKING DOWN ON RIVERAS?

13
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:45,215
>> DEFINITELY CRACKING DOWN IN

14
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:46,450
EUROPE, THE BIGGEST POLITICS IS

15
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:50,454
IMMIGRATION AND IMMIGRATION

16
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:53,157
CONTROL, BORDER CONTROL, ETHNIC

17
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:56,860
TENSION BETWEEN MUSLIM AND ARAB

18
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:57,528
POPULATIONS, MANY DISPLACED

19
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:00,931
PEOPLE OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND

20
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:03,634
THE INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS WHO

21
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:06,803
FEAR THEIR CULTURE CHANGING.

22
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,112
OF HIS ANGLE ON IMMIGRATION FROM

23
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:20,417
WATCHING THE BRITISH EFFORT

24
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:26,490
LARGELY DRIVEN BY IMMIGRATION,

25
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:34,464
>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

26
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:35,165
AS EUROPE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT

27
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:35,933
WHAT TO DO WITH THE MIGRANTS THE

28
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,168
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

29
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:41,838
IN GREAT FALLS SAID THIS ABOUT

30
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:44,441
OUR PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRATION.

31
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:50,480
>> THE DEMOCRATS, RADICAL

32
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,215
IMMIGRATION AGENDA, WE BELIEVE,

33
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,750
THEY SAY, IN SANCTUARY CITIES

34
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:54,484
WHERE THEY HOUSE THE CRIMINALS

35
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:57,454
AND OTHERS, DEMOCRATS ONCE OPEN

36
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:01,792
BORDERS, WHICH MEANS LOTS OF

37
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:02,459
CRIME.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,362
WE WENT TOUGH, STRONG, POWERFUL

39
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:11,268
VOTERS AND WE WANT NO CRIME AND

40
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:11,969
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT ICE.

41
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,570
WE PROTECT ICE.

42
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:19,276
THEY PROTECT US AND WE PROTECT

43
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:19,576
THEM.

44
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:24,114
>> IT SOUNDS AS IF IMMIGRATION

45
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:24,815
IS GOING TO BE A BIG CAMPAIGN

46
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:25,549
THEME RIGHT UP TO THE MIDTERMS

47
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,417
AND IF THINGS ARE NOT FIXED,

48
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:27,718
2020.

49
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,855
>> I DEFINITELY AGREE.

50
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,691
THE BLUEPRINT IS AS GRAPHIC AS

51
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:35,158
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

52
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,733
POLITICAL ASPECT AND THE

53
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:47,504
PRESIDENT TO EMPHASIZE FOR

54
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,206
EXAMPLE MS 13 AND OTHER

55
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:53,343
GANGBANGERS AND DRUG CARTELS AND

56
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:58,815
KNOW I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON

57
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:08,358
THE BORDER, THE REALITY IS A LOT

58
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:11,361
WE ARE NOT TALKING NECESSARILY

59
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:11,862
ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

60
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:13,997
IT IS DOWN IN THE LAST MONTH.

61
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:14,698
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS

62
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,636
ALMOST THIS THIS RULE ORGANIC

63
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:20,304
FEAR MANY PEOPLE HAVE THAT

64
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:32,949
IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO

65
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,183
FEAR MANY PEOPLE HAVE THAT
IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO

66
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:33,884
COME WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION OR

67
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:34,618
LEGALITY OR WRECKING AMERICA OR

68
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,352
A DRAIN ON OUR RESOURCES, PUBLIC

69
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:37,521
TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE VIGOROUS

70
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:42,459
WAY AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.

71
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:47,264
WILL LEAD THEM TO SUCCESS IN

72
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:47,631
NOVEMBER.

73
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:50,634
IF THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

74
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:51,335
BREAKUP OF FAMILIES, THAT IS

75
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:51,735
THEIR ISSUE.

76
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,837
IF THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON ABOLISH

77
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:59,109
ICE THAT HELPS THE PRESIDENT.

78
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,509
>> I AGREE.

79
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,177
YOU CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

80
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:05,849
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT MADE A

81
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,550
TERRIBLE MISTAKE IN TERMS OF

82
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,284
FAMILY SEPARATION AND WE TALKED

83
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:07,751
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

84
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:13,490
THE POTUS WHO IS A DEAR FRIEND

85
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,458
OF MINE AND I WISH HIM THE BEST

86
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,828
BUT HE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE

87
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,528
IN TERMS OF FAMILY SEPARATION.

88
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,432
ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAS HIS

89
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,634
ANGELS, VICTIMS OF IMMIGRANT

90
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:29,639
CRIME, ENOUGH TO GIN UP THE

91
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,340
REPUBLICAN BASE PARTICULARLY

92
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:31,108
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS DEEP-SEATED

93
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:35,379
FEAR THAT THE WAVE OF

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,146
UNREGULATED DOCUMENTS IMMIGRANTS

95
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:38,448
FROM SOUTH AMERICA PARTICULARLY

96
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,183
AND AFRICA CHANGING THE NATION.

97
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,494
SEE NO OUT INSIGHT BETWEEN NOW

98
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,228
AND THE MIDTERM ELECTION, THE

99
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:51,962
TWO SIDES HAVE CHOSEN, DEMOCRATS

100
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:54,765
HAVE CHOSEN A MORE LIBERAL

101
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:58,435
APPROACH, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE

102
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:02,639
CHOSEN A LAW AND ORDER APPROACH

103
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,173
AND PEOPLE WILL --

104
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:06,443
>> THE SUPREME COURT IN MANY

105
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:07,144
WAYS, ONE ISSUE CAMPAIGN FOR

106
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:07,577
SOME PEOPLE.

107
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:08,278
>> THE PRESIDENT IS DRAWING A

108
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,481
LINE IN THE SAND BRANDING

109
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:18,955
DEMOCRATS AS THE OPEN BORDER, DO

110
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:19,689
AWAY WITH ICE PARTY SO WE WILL

111
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,290
SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.

112
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:20,957
I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE

113
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:21,658
SUPREME COURT, THE PRESIDENT

114
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,160
SPOKE ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT AT

115
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:23,827
THIS RALLY AND TALKED ABOUT

116
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,396
JUSTICE KENNEDY AND HOW HE GAVE

117
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,899
HIM TRUST, PICK SOMEONE HE WOULD

118
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,299
BE PROUD OF.

119
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,637
HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID.

120
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:34,304
>> I WANT TO THANK JUSTICE

121
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:38,408
KENNEDY FOR HIS LIFETIME OF

122
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,978
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE.

123
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:42,746
HE HAD CONFIDENCE IN ME, YOU'RE

124
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:43,480
GOING TO PICK SOMEBODY, GREAT.

125
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,214
IF YOU TUNE IN MONDAY AT 9:00 I

126
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:52,823
THINK YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY

127
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:53,123
HAPPY.

128
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:55,425
THREE FINAL CANDIDATES, YOU HAVE

129
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:56,159
AMY BARRETT, BRETT CAVANAGH AND

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,264
RAYMONDKETHRIDGE

131
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:10,373
HAVE INCREDIBLE BACKGROUND,

132
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:17,981
THE PRESIDENT HAS A WAY OF

133
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:18,515
BUILDING SUSPENSE.

134
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:19,249
NEIL GORSUCH WAS AN UNEXPECTED

135
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,452
DIG BUT I REMEMBER DEMOCRATS

136
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:23,587
KICKING THE SAME THING, HE IS

137
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:29,459
LET IT GO BECAUSE THAT IS THE

138
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,863
SCALIA SEAT, YOU HAVE A

139
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:33,597
HARD-CORE RIGHT-WINGER NET SEAT,

140
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:35,632
NEIL GORSUCH CAN'T BE WORSE BUT

141
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:40,804
THIS IS DIFFERENT, KENNEDY HAS

142
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:42,105
BEEN A SWING VOTE ON THE COURT,

143
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:45,642
WITH THE LIBERALS ON MANY 5-4

144
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:51,615
CASES, BIG DEFENDER OF ROE V

145
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:54,618
WADE.

146
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,352
IMMIGRATION IS THE BIG POLITICAL

147
00:06:55,353 --> 00:07:00,457
ISSUE, DEEP DOWN IN TERMS OF

148
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,157
POLITICS AND ELECTED POLITICS

149
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:02,592
THIS IS ONE THAT WOMEN'S RALLY

150
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:03,293
WAS THE DAY THE PRESIDENT WAS

151
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:06,563
ABORTION.

152
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:07,330
90% OF THE CANDIDATES CHOSEN BY

153
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:09,966
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE SOMEONE HE

154
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:10,734
EXPECTS WILL REVERSE OR DIMINISH

155
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:14,371
ROE V WADE, 10% OF THE OTHER

156
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:14,704
ISSUES.

157
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:20,443
IN THAT MIX, AMY BARRETT SEEMS

158
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:22,412
TO BE ON APPELLATE COURT JUDGE,

159
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,748
ALL 3 OF THEM WELL-REGARDED BUT

160
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:26,449
SHE SEEMS THE ONE SOCIAL

161
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,552
CONSERVATIVES SEEM MOST

162
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:31,288
COMFORTABLE WITH ON THIS ISSUE.

163
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:42,465
CLERKS.

164
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:43,133
>> THINK HOW THAT WOULD BE

165
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:43,833
COVERED ON TELEVISION IF HE

166
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:44,568
MAKES THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TO SEE

167
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,268
JUSTICE KENNEDY GIVE A HUG OR

168
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:46,403
HANDSHAKE TO ONE OF THE PEOPLE

169
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:48,672
THAT WORKS FOR HIM AT ONE POINT.

170
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:52,475
>> EITHER OF THE TWO GUYS BUT I

171
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:57,714
THINK BECAUSE IT WILL COME DOWN

172
00:07:57,715 --> 00:07:58,381
TO SOCIAL CONSERVATISM THAT

173
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:03,353
JUDGE BARRETT HAS THE INSIDE

174
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:07,691
TRACK.

175
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:08,158
WHAT DO I KNOW?

176
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,659
>> YOU COULD BE RIGHT.

177
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,364
MANY PEOPLE WILL COME OUT

178
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:14,931
AGAINST JUDGE BARRETT.

179
00:08:18,402 --> 00:00:00,000
>> MORE PEOPLE CRITICIZE HIS
