some of his recent comments indicate that Donald Trump may be considering dialing back the hardline immigration proposals that first launched him to campaign success for instance Trump spokesman now say they may not actually be a deportation force that will drag Mexican mothers from their homes kick them to death in front of their weeping children and then hurl their broken bodies back across the border while shouting this is for the Alamo you brown-skinned which also e-verify may go by the boards as well although Trump supporters admit they're disappointed to hear of these changes they remain committed to Trump because they say he's the one and only candidate who is not afraid to demonstrate what it would have looked like if there had been a cheese puffs character and sausage party therefore say Trump supporters they are preparing reaction statements so they will be ready for whatever change in Trump's policy should be announced if Trump should announce that he is no longer committed to deporting the between 11 and 300 million illegal immigrants now living in the United States the Trump supporters plan to say the Trump has never run for office before and it's only reasonable that he might have to modify some of his original positions as he continues to learn and grow if Trump should then announce that he will not in fact build a wall to keep out future illegal immigrants Trump supporters will say that Trump is refusing to be pigeonholed by the elite but is playing a four dimensional chess game in which the announcement of the wall has already caused a mental wall to rise in the imaginations of Mexicans so that if they try to cross the border they will hit the imaginary wall causing their noses to suddenly squash against their faces as they reel backwards into Tijuana if Trump should announce that he plans to unilaterally declare an unconstitutional amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants who are already here Trump supporters will respond that as a political outsider Trump is not prone to the mindless Constitution worship of deep state conspirators who want to sow hostility at the border so they can divide us from our Mexican friends while they establish a one-world government if Trump should announced that instead of a wall he plans to build ramps on the borders so that illegals can enter the country more easily by jumping over the Rio Grande on harley-davidsons while waving la raza flags with the legend make America Mexico again and screaming Arriba Arriba Trump supporters planned to respond the Trump is not a politician so it's only natural that he would lie repeatedly and change his positions with the wind of popular opinion and finally if Trump should say that his supporters of the biggest bunch of suckers he ever met and he never before realized that white men could be so gullible his supporters plan to celebrate how Trump refuses to cut kowtow to political correctness and just tells it like it is then they'll blame the Jews trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right defending the Trump people right because you know my wife always says that my role in life is to alienate

take it take action you won't have any questions left alright let's talk about these Hillary emails so remember when Hillary Clinton said she had released all her emails included that I have now put out all of my emails go and ask others for their emails ask everybody else who's in public office I'm the one who's done it and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do what role well it's again this does she ever tell the truth I mean does she ever say any it looks like that old joke about convicts how do you know their line it's when their mouths are moving it's like there's a Larry Clinton is like this anyway the FBI now discovered they have almost fifteen thousand fourteen thousand nine hundred emails that haven't been released and there the State Department says they want to vet them and see if they have you know are they duplicates are they personal or they work and a federal judge said yeah hurry up get him out there so the State Department says they're gonna get them out by October I'm holding my breath and I should be dead by late just around November I should just collapse out of holding my breath so we'll see we'll see if they get these out in October the New York Times is very worried there you know every every story about Hillary's dishonesty always starts with Republicans try to make a you know these poor Republicans are walking down the street she lied it's not our fault anyway so that's that and then these emails that have already come out here's the thing that drives me nuts the Judicial Watch has these FOIA emails right they oh I a the Freedom of Information Act where you file you know you say you have to show us these emails they're public property and then a judge reviews it and then 50 years later after the government finally decides they're going to comply they turn over these emails why is Judicial Watch is a conservative organization Citizens United it also does this why isn't the press doing this why isn't the New York Times doing this I mean the way this works is Judicial Watch or Citizens United files of FOIA finally the government complies and turns over at what usually at with a judge kicking them in the butt they comply and they turn over the emails and then the Clinton camp says well these are just right-wing groups you know asking for the well that's true but why isn't the New York Times do we know why you know this is a news story this is a news right so let's so now they're looking through these emails that they've already got and they are showing that there was a permeable wall we'll call it as opposed as by which I mean no wall at all between the Clinton Foundation people giving money to the Clinton Foundation and those people who were able to contact the State Department while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and asked for meetings so they found one for instance from June 2009 Doug ban because he's the guy who's running the Clinton Foundation he writes to Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton's top I mean her top advisor did they asked her right would you stop making that joke I'm saying oh it's me I'm sorry evident and he says that the crown prince of Bahrain would like a meeting and he writes you know good friend of ours good good friend of ours and his email I love that good friend of ours which what that means is he gave somewhere around a hundred grand to the Clinton Foundation plus like thirty two million dollars in one of their programs for educating people and he wants to he wants to get a meeting with mrs. Clinton and Huma writes back you know she doesn't want to commit to anything until she knows how she will feel and a lot of the emails I get back to this in a minute but a lot of these emails have lines like that in it anyway she finally says okay well I I've reached out through normal channels so the story basically is well she doesn't you know she doesn't allow these meetings just because this guy had a contribution but you try writing to the State Department and see how fast your request is to meet with the Secretary of State goes through goes through normal channels so that's one and then there was another one mr. ban Douglas bans sought whom Abaddon's helped in obtaining a visa for a member of a UK soccer team at the request of Casey Wasserman the president of the Wasserman Foundation which donated between five and ten million dollars to the Clinton Foundation and Miss Abbott and writes I doubt we can do anything but maybe we can help with an interview I got this now it makes me nervous to get involved but I'll ask and ban says well don't ask if you're nervous but I mean this is just this is an open channel this is what they call pay for play if you gave money to the Clinton Foundation you had an in and of course Donald Trump quite rightly is hitting this hard no issue better illustrates corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State as the evidence has become public over the last several months I become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton's criminality her actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important departments of government indeed before established by the United States Constitution itself the amounts involved the favors done and the significant number of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor some former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of Rico racketeering influence corrupt organization enterprise the Justice Department is required to appoint an independent special prosecutor because it has proven itself to be reeling sadly a political arm of the White House all true I mean everything he's saying right there is true if he can keep from you know stepping on his own tongue he's like this is a huge issue and the thing is you know you read you read the mainstream media they're downplaying stuff they do what they do and they always parse these things well did he do this did she do that you know what did she actually have this meeting and all this stuff but the problem with the Clintons and this was a problem when Bill Clinton was in the White House is they lower the standards for everybody when Bill Clinton was first caught with having an affair in our Oval Office that we pay for with Monica Lewinsky a woman no young enough to be his daughter a something that would have gotten any CEO in the country including Roger Ailes fired from his position okay when that happened I remember one of the news men I think it was Peter Jennings came out and said if this is true he will be gone with it he will resign within 48 hours within 72 hours whatever it was he said and of course we all remember that the mainstream media dumped this story and Drudge broke at drugs broke the story of the stained dress and all the stuff and the thing is that was the state of play at that moment at that moment the state of play was that a president who cheated on his wife openly cheated on his wife in the Oval Office while he was but we all know that John F Kennedy did it we know he did it with like several women at the same time in the Oval Office but he never got caught the press buried the story the state of play was that if you got caught doing this you were gone when we accepted the Bill Clinton standard that if I can stay and fight this out and defend and tell you that is doesn't mean is and you know oral sexes and sex and you know play with words until I'm just and just last about it's the old Clinton routine you know I'm not gonna go online I'm lying I'm lying oh this is an old story you know you're caught lying that's an old story you know because I lied long enough to make it an old story so now it's an old story nowadays of course you can get caught doing almost anything sexual and it's it's fine nobody says a word you know you get you say you know yes I you know I was cheating on my wife with a man but now my gay identity has come out now I have to be honest with myself you know and it's all fine and that is the Clinton way that Clinton brings down the Clintons bring down the country and Hillary is now doing it on the level of honesty you even have news men saying well does it really matter if a politician is honest and the answer is yes damn straight it matters this is what we hire them to do we hire them to run things and tell us what they're doing and you know if they're gonna lie then we have no way of knowing what our government is up to this is what Clinton does everything they touch becomes worse and this every standard becomes less and getting back to this health thing so many of these emails have remarks in them like I'm not feeling great you know I'm not feeling good this is maybe not today I don't feel so good and I don't want a fuel a conspiracy I know the right is just as prone to conspiracies as the left and I know they go out there and and they say you know Barack Obama was born in Kenya or you know Ted Cruz's dad killed JFK and all this stupid stuff that happens on the right but she looks sick to me too I gotta say every time she sits down she flinches you know she she coughs all the time she goes off on these kind of like you see her eyes go up Rudy Guiliani says the whole thing is being covered up by the by the press she has entire media empire that constantly demonizes Donald Trump and fails to point out that she hasn't had a press conference in three 300 days 200 days a hundred days out on Howell fails to point out several signs of illness by her well so go online and put down Hillary Clinton illness take a look at the videos for yourself so I did that and it's there's nothing conclusive you know I mean it's all the stuff you can always find stuff online that looks weird and all this but all I will say about this is this I know the press is acting exactly as if this is true they're having debates it is Hillary's health off limits she's 70 she's running for president the United States why is her health off limits when did you know when did that happen pardon me when did that standard suddenly appear and Hillary goes on jimmy kimmel and with the help of Kimmel's writers no doubt does this cute little routine about her help are you in good health well this has become one of their themes here you take my take my pulse while I'm talking talk back in October the National Enquirer said I would be dead in six months oh oh so with every breath I take I feel like it's a you have a new lease on life a new lease on life I don't know why they are saying this I think on the one hand it's part of the wacky strategy uh-uh-uh just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you on the other hand it just absolutely makes no sense and I I don't go around questioning Donald Trump's health I mean as far as I can tell he's as healthy as a horse well his doctor said he had the best health madam examination he's ever seen any human being can you open this jar of pickles this is okay so that's very cute you know they've got me what is he got a staff of 30 writers to make Hillary Clinton look almost human meanwhile she's got this she's wearing this thing buttoned up to it to her chin she's got enough makeup on her to make another face she looks like a head floating in a jar you know just like a body painted on the glass I mean there's something I don't know I I don't like I don't like I said I don't like the start conspiracy theories at all but there's something this woman and and you know look if you're 70 there's probably something wrong with you but I just wonder how serious it is she has suffered this terrible concussion she fell down you know and all this stuff and she's always seems to be slipping and falling who knows who knows we will find out and Trump would have a lot more power to pull this to our attention if he hadn't gone for the birther garbage with Obama if he hadn't gone for the Ted Cruz dad killed Kennedy stuff I mean that stuff just gives him absolutely no credibility at all speaking of Trump's credibility of course there's now this thing about is he pulling back on the border wall and the reason this is important of course is this is what made him a viable candidate this is what really got people going especially people like Ann Coulter who feel that the world is coming apart oh I have to stop and say goodbye oh gosh you're gonna miss the best part if you don't come to the Daily wire I'll say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come to the Daily wire and hear the rest
