welcome to the car cast everyone so we were talking yesterday about about the the the reasons why young people have left the church and I gave my theory my theory is that young people are leaving the church because the church has tried to be trendy and cool it's tried to appeal to the shallowest most superficial aspects of young people rather than appealing to their deeper characteristics and that would be their hunger for change and identity their you know hunger for a cause to fight for a mission their radicalism their revolutionary nature all that great stuff so it should be a match made in heaven literally between young people and Christianity because Christianity is a radical revolutionary cause right to fight for but instead we've watered everything down and in an attempt to make it more palatable but really what's happened is we've alienated everybody including young people now it received a lot of feedback to that discussion and I want some of it positive some of it negative as usual I wanted to I wanted to address one objection one email because it represents I think a lot of the critiques that I read after we talked about this so I got one I got an email from a guy fellow Christian and he said that he agreed with much of what I said he agreed with the general argument for the most part but he also thinks that the real problem or one of the biggest problems is that young people are really repulsed by the rules the so-called rules in Christianity especially the rules that govern governed their sex lives and he said that if churches would de-emphasize those things de-emphasize the teachings on abstinence chastity especially the idea that sex outside of marriage is wrong if we de-emphasize that that we might have a better shot of bringing people in and this idea I've heard echoed by many other people now I have several objections to that objection and I want to go through them one at a time so first of all let's start with this churches have de-emphasized those things or outright rejected them and I find it fairly mind-boggling that there are still so many people who think that the church's main problem is that it's too conservative and too Orthodox and that it's too focused on rules and that you know the biggest problem is all these Christians running around who are fundamentalist and they're they're so focused on religious discipline means what where is that a problem where are you meeting all these Christians who that's their biggest issue I mean really what are you talking about I have not noticed that the vast vast majority of Christians that you meet could care less about the rules could care less about the commandments they make no attempt to follow them whatsoever in their lives and the vast majority of churches that you go to they'll never talk about these they're not gonna ever talk about sexual morality it's a chastity I mean really you you think look with all due respect I just as I said I find it mind-boggling this idea that there's a problem with Christians being too focused on chastity will you ever hear anyone talking about chastity anymore it's extremely rare and it's extremely rare I'm just telling it's extremely rare to find a church that talks about these things okay so the point is we have to emphasize them we have liberalized and that's been one of the great causes of the problem which means it cannot be the solution second I don't like the term rules to describe the teachings and commandments of God because they're their rules in the same way that gravity is a rule okay these these things are inherent the moral Commandments that you find in the Bible call them rules if you want to but they are not random they're not arbitrary and saying and calling them rules makes it sound arbitrary and I think people use that term on purpose they want it to sound arbitrary they want to make it sound like this is just something Christians came up with or even something that just God came up with randomly just wanting to cramp our style I guess but that's not the case the moral laws of Christianity are inherent they can be found within human nature they are part of the nature of things just like gravity on a physical level this part of the nature of things so Christianity says that it's destructive and disordered to lust after women to sleep around the turn section to a game to be promiscuous all that but Christianity isn't just giving its opinion it isn't just giving suggesting one possible way to live that's equal to all the other ways no it's it's telling you something that's just true and every person who's treated sex like a game who has lived by lust and self-indulgence whether Christian or not has suffered the misery and degradation that comes with that lifestyle just as every person who jumps from a building has had to deal with the fact that gravity is going to assert itself and in the same way those moral laws assert themselves whether we choose to abide by them or not third thing you say that people don't want rules they don't want Commandments they don't want to be told what to do I disagree I think now on the surface that might be true again surface level it's true that people don't want to be told what to do on a deeper level I think people are starving to be told what to do they're starving for direction for instruction they're starving for lines to be drawn they are I think when you go to someone and you say do what you are any whatever you want do anything that you are it's all equal there's no bad there's no good everything's equally as bad he can we as good anything you want to do just go do it now they might be happy at first they might say oh awesome great but in the end they're going to be lost and confused and paralyzed in fact tell somebody that come back the next day you know what they're gonna be doing they'll probably still just be standing right there they haven't gone anywhere when you've told them every direction is equal is equal and nothing is better than a nail it's like well I don't okay what's the point of going anywhere then it's kind of like it's kind of a crude analogy here but it's sort of like um if you go to one of these chain restaurants where it seems like the menus of these restaurants just grow by the minute and so now you open up a menu and there are six thousand things on it every variety is there's a to Mexican food Italian food American food you know everything and what happens that you have no idea it's too many options you don't even know it's you have no idea what to and then what do you do you end up asking the waiter well what do you think I should get you need some direction you need someone to help you like just this is too much it's too many options give me some clarity here give me some direction give me some advice or something don't just give me 6,000 options and say eat whatever you want right so it kind of works that way morally in our lives there are two types of freedom okay there are there's the freedom of a life devoid of all meaning of all purpose of the devoid of Direction devoid of morality there's that freedom where there's no rules and then there's the freedom that you find in truth and in God there's the freedom that you find when you willingly surrendered to the moral Commandments that God has given us when you surrender to God so there's this free there's the freedom and pride where you say I'm gonna do whatever I want and then there's the freedom in surrender to God saying show me the way and I will walk it that's the freedom that we find when God has not only told us but he's shown us Jesus Christ walked the path and he said follow me he didn't say just go do whatever you want everything's equal nothing's worked bad nothing's good there's no sin he said follow me and so when you follow him you find true freedom even if in this life you're also going to find suffering and sacrifice and all that so that's the only true freedom that's where you can really be happy but in order to enjoy that freedom you have to follow the quote rules just as you have to follow the rule of gravity after you have to obey its dictates respect it understand it if you want to enjoy skydiving okay skydiving with a parachute is controlled it's restricted there are rules if you want to do it you've never done before you got to go take a class and they get they give you all the different instructions you fill out forms you do everything right there are a lot of rules I've never been skydiving my understanding though is there are a lot of rules with skydiving and so there's you know you could do it that way or you could do it the freeway and you could really be free and you could skydive without a parachute one is fun and exciting the other is suicide so which way is actually free the one where you splatter on the pavement and die at the end or the one where you learn the rules and you respect them and you follow them and you know you take the more controlled and restricted approach another example I think we could look at marriage in modern times you know we've done away with all the roles all the rules all the idea all ideas of duty and responsibility we've done away with the man's Authority and headship in the home and now we say everything's 50/50 there are no roles there are no rules there are no duties there are no responsibilities that anyone in particular is supposed to be need to be doing everyone just does everything nobody leads nobody follows nobody's in charge nobody nothing right there's no head of the home and and so this is this is supposed to be a free marriage right they free and equal marriage where everyone just can do whatever they want now I ask you has this led to happy and fulfilled marriages across the country I can't even say it without laughing even though it's not funny but it is it's just the absurdity of this idea that it's actually worked out right do you think it's worked out because I look across the country and I see divorce I see you know unhappy and miserable people in their marriages I see I see an entire generation of people my generation who have almost given up on marriage completely they take such a dim view of it so has this equal 50/50 free and open approach to marriage has it worked no instead again it's caused this paralysis people in relationships don't know what they're supposed to do they don't know who's supposed to do what now with gender roles with those bad old ancient gender roles people knew basically what they're supposed to do in a marriage and within those you know within those parameters there's a lot of freedom and still there's a lot of diversity in marriages and marriages can you know are all different because there are different people involved in them but when you have this basic idea of gender roles well now at least you you can get going you can go in one direction because you know where you're supposed to go and you have a general idea of what you're supposed to be doing but we don't have that anymore so people don't know what they're supposed to do how they're supposed to relate and then what happens is competition arises and they end up competing and working against each other because they've rejected the roles the rules that help them make their marriages work and help them work with each other so that they can enjoy a happy and complimentary and free marriage fourth thing and this point is related to all the rest that I've mentioned but you say that young people aren't interested in chastity and abstinence and sexual morality once again that is only on the surgeons on the surface yet they're not interested let's look at a deeper level deeper level we can see that the alternative has not been a great success modern sexuality like modern marriage unsurprisingly the two are linked modern sexuality is a disaster zone it's it's a catastrophe disease abortion unwed pregnancy porn addiction the sexual revolution has been a catastrophic failure people are not happy find me someone my age 31 32 who's been sleeping around and dating frivolously for the last 10 or 15 years or longer and yet is happy and satisfied and content and not lonely at all find me someone like that it can't they're all miserable all the people that have tried it this way they followed the ideas of the sexual revolution they've wanted to be free sexual freedom I mean look at you know we had a baby boomers came along my parents generation and they said I want sexual freedom and what do we end up with disease abortion death divorce I mean all these that's what freedom has gotten us is destruction and despair people are unfulfilled in the romantic lives and worse than that they feel violated what do you think all this affirmative consent stuff is about you have women who they have sex consensually and the next day they claim that they were assaulted because they they was gonna think they volunteered to do it but they volunteered and they had reservations and they didn't stay with unspoken reservation and there's there was something in the back of their mind telling them no that this isn't right don't do this but they did it anyway now what does that stem from they feel violated because they were violated though they offer themselves up to be violent they feel degraded because they were degraded though they were willing participants in their own degradation they wake up feeling used because they were used though they allowed themselves to be used which makes them feel even worse because now there's guilt you and nobody can really be happy with that you see what we've done is you find this over and over and over where somebody comes in and they get rid of the rules they get rid of the more any sense of morality they get rid of all that and then what and then catastrophe and disaster soon follows and so then they try to make new rules the whole idea was to get rid of rules and now they're making new ones and the new ones are even more restricting and weird and bizarre and confusing than the old ones and so what's happened is we've got rid of all that all of them the moral laws and you know all any sense of sexual morality we've tossed out the window the only thing that we've left is consent that was the one last thing now consent was already embedded into Christian sexual morality consent was part of it Christianity has always been against rape very clearly so that was already part of it but there was more to it because Christianity recognizes that yeah you have to consent to a sexual act but that's just that's just the beginning it's that in itself is not enough you could consent to a sexual act and yet still be harmed by it physically and spiritually and so there's got to be more than just consent but what our culture has said is no consent so that mattered but what have they found they found that Christianity was right there's got to be more that's consent is not enough because people are consenting to sex and yet they still feel awful and guilty and empty and ashamed the next day and so what our culture has tried to do is they've tried to take consent and use it as the raw material to build this whole new sexual ethic and they've turned consent into this like calculus this is impossible to understand calculus whereas it should be pretty simple it's consent if you did you did you participate in the act willingly if you did then you consented if you were forced into it you weren't you didn't you didn't consent really simple but now we've tried to take consent and to find a way to use it so as to in some way still protect the dignity of of women so that even if so there could be a situation where they volunteer to do it yet they didn't consent because they're gonna feel violated afterwards and so it just becomes very confusing it's not so confusing if you go back to the Christian sexual morality which says that sex is a sacred thing it's a beautiful wonderful precious thing and it has to be protected it's also very powerful it's powerful because sex can create a whole other person which is pretty incredible it's also powerful on a spiritual emotional level where you no matter what you try to say you know you when you when you offer yourself up to somebody like this and you are with someone in this most intimate way imaginable your whole being gets wrapped up into it as well and so their emotions get involved in all this and there's this kind of this bond that naturally and automatically forms Christianity recognizes that and so says okay this thing it's not because we hate sex no it's because we understand we don't we understand how powerful and wonderful this thing is and so we have to respect it and reserve it for the the protected parameters of a committed and loving and devoted marriage Christianity says that any other arrangement leads to despair misery and destruction and the world has proved this correct the last 60 years of American history have been one long case study proving Christian sexual ethics correct you don't have to take my word for it just look at the culture look at what's happened so no it's not it's not Christian Christianity doesn't hate sex our culture hates sex it has turned it into this meaningless empty thing like just a recreational activity and nothing more like a like a greeting between people like it's just shaking hands with a person it's having sex that's what our culture has done they hate and are afraid of what sex sex actually is whereas Christianity embraces it in its totality and says this is a good thing that comes from God it's so good in fact that you you can't just give it away you can't just let it be used it's got to be protected like anything else that's precious and valuable and personal and intimate you protect it you don't just give it to anybody this is why Christians believe or should believe in saving it for marriage now Christian teachings especially in the area of sex are difficult to follow but as Chesterton's and maybe it will see us Louis Oh Chesterton or Lewis what are those guys said that Christianity has not been tried and found wanting it's been found difficult and left untried so we have here an essential choice between the difficult but better thing or the easy but worst thing and I like I like that matchup personally that's a compelling argument I like that argument that matchup between difficult better easy worse that's good I like our chances of winning that argument but if we're going to win that argument we have to make it first and so you say oh no the church needs to back away from sexual morality all morality don't talk about it I say we should do the exact opposite just talk we should be talking about it a lot more because people need to hear this and they want to also even if they don't know because they're not happy with the other way no matter what they claims are not happy with it they want to find happiness and fulfillment here it is we got to tell them about it we can't be afraid to tell them we can't be in shit ashamed or embarrassed we're not the ones who should be ashamed or embarrassed of this belief system because it's right and it's true alright thanks for watching everybody um have a great day and Godspeed you
