You've never heard that
somebody ask an Italian person
or a French person or an
American person or even
maybe a Chinese person:
"Did you get integrated?"
It's always about the Muslims
when it's about integration.
And the fear — There's
a lot of fear in the society
of Muslims —Muslim
men especially—
that they are bad for
our society and that
they are bad for
the women.
Integration is
so big word.
It's my life, integration,
its always my life.
I think a lot of people, they
think this word, it's meaning
that you become a German
man, and it's impossible.
We like in first place to eat.
Yeah, we cook a lot.
We made a breakfast,
Omar made his hummus.
And I made
scrambled eggs.
It's not just my culture 
it's also Omar's culture.
We have learned a
lot from each other.
Cooking of course, Omar cooks
a lot of Syrian food very often.
And I started also to learn
to eat it, and to cook it.
I love to learn
another language.
I find it so interesting
to learn another language.
I am happy right now that I
am learning Deutsch — German.
Actually with German
right now, I have
more communication
with people.
Two languages, 
it's better than one.
When we are in the flat,
we try to speak German as much
as possible, and sometimes
we switch into English
because it's also the language
we got to know each other.
