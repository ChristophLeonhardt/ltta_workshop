MALICIOUSLY I DON’T BELIEVE. I THINK MICHAEL TAPED DONALD

57
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,241
I THINK MICHAEL TAPED DONALD TRUMP TO MEMORIALIZE HIS

58
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:24,975
TRUMP TO MEMORIALIZE HIS RELATIONSHIP SO THAT HE COULD

59
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,411
RELATIONSHIP SO THAT HE COULD FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, EIGHT YEARS

60
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,146
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, EIGHT YEARS FROM NOW OR EVEN COULD PLAY IT

61
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:29,780
FROM NOW OR EVEN COULD PLAY IT TO SOMEONE --

62
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,515
TO SOMEONE -- >> BUT HE’S ALSO TAPING

00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,319
CONVERSATIONS WITH JOURNALISTS, SO IS IT TO MEMORIALIZE

65
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,554
SO IS IT TO MEMORIALIZE CONVERSATIONS WITH JOURNALISTS

66
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:36,854
CONVERSATIONS WITH JOURNALISTS ALSO?

67
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,322
ALSO? >> MICHAEL NEVER TAPED DONALD

68
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,423
>> MICHAEL NEVER TAPED DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE WAS WORRIED

69
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,659
TRUMP BECAUSE HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT COVERING HIMSELF FOR LEGAL

70
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,827
ABOUT COVERING HIMSELF FOR LEGAL EXPOSURE OR SOMETHING ALONG

71
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,360
EXPOSURE OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.

72
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,361
THOSE LINES. I DON’T BELIEVE THAT.

73
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,865
I DON’T BELIEVE THAT. I THINK OMAROSA IS OMAROSA.

74
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,899
I THINK OMAROSA IS OMAROSA. BE CAREFUL AROUND HER.

75
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,334
BE CAREFUL AROUND HER. >> BUT COULD IT ALSO BE, AND

76
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,236
>> BUT COULD IT ALSO BE, AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE

77
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,137
THIS IS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENT.

78
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,672
DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENT. HE IS LOYAL TO YOU FOR AS LONG

79
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:55,773
HE IS LOYAL TO YOU FOR AS LONG AS HE NEEDS YOU.

80
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,608
AS HE NEEDS YOU. YOU’VE HAD FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE

81
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:58,042
YOU’VE HAD FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WITH THAT.

82
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:58,676
WITH THAT. >> YES, I HAVE.

83
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,278
>> YES, I HAVE. >> AND HE EXPECTS AND DEMANDS

84
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:01,045
>> AND HE EXPECTS AND DEMANDS LOYALTY BACK.

85
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,446
LOYALTY BACK. BUT WHEN HE DECIDES HE DOESN’T

86
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,748
BUT WHEN HE DECIDES HE DOESN’T NEED YOU ANY LONGER, YOU’RE CUT

87
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,750
NEED YOU ANY LONGER, YOU’RE CUT LOOSE, YOU’RE NOTHING TO HIM.

88
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,286
LOOSE, YOU’RE NOTHING TO HIM. SO THIS CULTURE OF LEAKING, OF

89
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,687
SO THIS CULTURE OF LEAKING, OF COVERING YOUR OWN BEHIND OF

90
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,021
COVERING YOUR OWN BEHIND OF TAPING.

91
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:10,388
TAPING. >> RIGHT.

92
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,056
>> RIGHT. >> COULD THAT BE BECAUSE FOLKS

93
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,059
>> COULD THAT BE BECAUSE FOLKS REALIZE THAT AT SOME POINT HE’S

94
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,061
REALIZE THAT AT SOME POINT HE’S GOING TO TAKE THE BUS AND BACK

95
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:18,462
GOING TO TAKE THE BUS AND BACK OVER THEM WITH IT?

96
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:20,665
OVER THEM WITH IT? >> LOOK, I THINK IN OMAROSA’S

97
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,800
>> LOOK, I THINK IN OMAROSA’S CASE, I THINK THAT SHE FEELS --

98
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:27,972
CASE, I THINK THAT SHE FEELS -- I SAID TO GABE SHERMAN IN THAT

99
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:32,176
I SAID TO GABE SHERMAN IN THAT ARTICLE, HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE

100
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:33,310
ARTICLE, HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE OMAROSA SCORNED.

101
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,612
OMAROSA SCORNED. THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT SHE

102
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:37,482
THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT SHE SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN TAPING IN

103
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,585
SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN TAPING IN THE STAT ROOM I HAVE NO PROBLEM

104
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,020
THE STAT ROOM I HAVE NO PROBLEM BECAUSE I THINK KELLY MISHANDLED

105
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:42,754
BECAUSE I THINK KELLY MISHANDLED THAT SITUATION.

106
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,222
THAT SITUATION. THEN AFTER THAT WHEN THEY TOLD

107
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,658
THEN AFTER THAT WHEN THEY TOLD HER SUBSEQUENTLY, WELL, WE

108
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,625
HER SUBSEQUENTLY, WELL, WE DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT.

109
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,227
DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT. PERHAPS THEY DID, PERHAPS THEY

110
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:49,561
PERHAPS THEY DID, PERHAPS THEY DIDN’T.

111
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:50,728
DIDN’T. IT WASN’T THE WAY TO HANDLE IT

112
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,196
IT WASN’T THE WAY TO HANDLE IT WITH SOMEBODY LIKE OMAROSA.

113
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:53,531
WITH SOMEBODY LIKE OMAROSA. I THINK IT WAS A CRITICAL

114
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:53,832
I THINK IT WAS A CRITICAL MISTAKE.

115
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,935
MISTAKE. I THINK THAT KELLY, BY THE WAY,

116
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:57,602
I THINK THAT KELLY, BY THE WAY, IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT’S

117
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,505
IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT’S ACTUALLY PRODDING THE PRESIDENT

118
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:01,039
ACTUALLY PRODDING THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO ARREST HER.

119
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:01,940
TO TRY TO ARREST HER. >> YOU THINK KELLY IS TELLING

THE PRESIDENT TO TELL JEFF SESSIONS TO ARREST THAT?

122
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,744
SESSIONS TO ARREST THAT? >> I’VE HEARD THAT FROM OTHER
