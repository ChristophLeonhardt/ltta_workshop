this week on the business of life we
travel to Charlotte to explain where
your tax money goes here are a few
political cliches you've probably heard
recently the rich control an
increasingly large piece of the economic
pie they are paying their fair share if
we increase taxes our economy will
become uncompetitive like France so are
you paying too much and getting too
little in return or are the one percent
paying too little liking the gap between
rich and poor everything you need to
know about taxes broken down through
facts and figures by the smartest people
in the room if everybody pays our taxes
and you don't then you're a freeloader
if nobody pays our taxes and you do then
you're a sucker this is the business of
life
