I just came from the factory where they
produce the cars and I'm driving a
gazelle next then it's nice absolutely
nice but you know I'm a big boy I like
the big toys I need a little bit more
and I know they've got exactly what I'm
looking for
it's a raising charge it's set up for
different races not for icy conditions
like this so it is for me it's a little
bit all over the place
and it's also set up for professional
drivers and I'm not a professional
driver
but I'm getting that
this truck is a fun ride but it's so
difficult I need a bigger car
a bigger truck a bigger whatever but an
easier drive so let's see what this is
it's got eight gear than I've got no
clue and I think it's much easier to be
a goalkeeper than a rally driver if I
was to have a place in a rally team this
would be my job my place support vehicle
driver that was really good fun
