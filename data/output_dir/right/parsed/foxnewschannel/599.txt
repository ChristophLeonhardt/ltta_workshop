PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN
BUT THIS WEEK HE CAUSED A MEDIA
EXPLOSION BY RATCHETING UP THE
MEDIA ON JEFF SESSIONS.
HE SAID THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
SHOULD STOP THE WITCH HUNT RIGHT
NOW BEFORE IT CONTINUES TO STAIN
OUR COUNTRY ANY FURTHER.
JOINING US.
A "WASHINGTON EXAMINER"
CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR IN OHIO.
HE'S SUGGESTING HIS ATTORNEY
GENERAL BLOW OFF THE FACT THAT
HE RECUSED HIMSELF FOR ETHICAL
REASONS.
IS THE MEDIA STORM AROUND THIS
JUSTIFIED?
MOLLIE: IT'S GOOD TO TALK ABOUT
THIS.
BUT WE NEED MEDIA PEOPLE WHO
UNDERSTAND HOW DONALD TRUMP
SPEAKS.
AFTER TWO YEARS OF SEEING HIM
SPEAK IN PUBLIC AND SEEING HIS
HE'S EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION WITH
A PROBE THAT SIDELINED HIS
ADMINISTRATION FOR A YEAR AND A
HALF.
EVERYONE ELSE NOT JUST BEING
POLITICIANS, BUT PEOPLE IN THE
MEDIA ARE NOT HOLDING MUELLER
ACCOUNTABLE.
THEY THINK THEIR JOB IS TO
CHEERLEAD INSTEAD OF ASK
QUESTIONS.
WHY HASN'T HE FOUND COLLUSION
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH
WAYS WE WERE PROMISED BY THE
MEDIA.
WE ARE NOT SEEING GOOD
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PRESIDENT
TRUMP SPEAKS.
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE WITCH HUNT AND THE
OF COVERAGE OF THE STORY HE
HATES?
GILLIAN: THERE IS AN OLD ADAGE
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES BAD
COVERAGE IS BETTER TO NO
THAT RULE.
HOWIE: HE KEEPS COMING BACK TO
IS DOING A GREAT JOB AT LARGE,
POINTING OUT TO THE PRESIDENT,
WHY DO YOU EVER TWEET ABOUT
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ECONOMY.
WHY DO YOU TWEET ABOUT ANYTHING
OTHER THAN 4.1% GDP.
IT SEEMS YOU ARE DERAILING YOUR
AGENDA, YOU ARE ALREADY THE MOST
OF WIDELY COVERED PRESIDENT IN
WITH RUSSIA TO STEAL AN
ELECTION.
I THINK HE LIKES REMINDING
PEOPLE OF THAT.
GILLIAN: HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO
HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION BE
SIDELINED?
HE'S ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS.
CAPRI: IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY
SHOULDN'T CONTINUE TO DO THE
WORK THEY ARE DOING.
HOWIE: I INTERVIEWED RUDY
I ASKED HIM, I SAID HE -- I SAID
HE NAMED SESSIONS.
AND HE SAID HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
A GENERIC ATTORNEY GENERAL.
CAPRI: I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A
LOT OF SCRUTINY ON THIS.
ON ONE HAND THERE ARE SOME IN
THE MEDIA THAT UNDERSTAND SORT
OF THE NUANCES OF DONALD TRUMP.
HE GETS FRUSTRATED.
HE SEES SOMETHING, HE TAKES TO
TWITTER AND REACTS.
BUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF
THIS.
BECAUSE THERE IS ALL THE
DISCUSSION SOUNDING OBSTRUCTION
OF JUSTICE AND HE IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AS WE SAW IN THAT CLIP FROM CNN.
WHAT HE SAYS AND WHEN HE USES
HIS WORDS, THEY MATTER.
HOWIE: WE CAN ALL AGREE HE'S NOT
AND TAX EVASION AND PRETTY MUCH
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DONALD
TRUMP OR THE CAMPAIGN.
MOLLIE: EVERYONE IS INTERESTED
IN THIS TRIAL AS PART OF THE
COLLUSION THEORY WITH RUSSIA.
BUT THE PROSECUTORS SAY THEY ARE
NOT BRINGING UP COLLUSION.
WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYONE
ACTUALLY ASKING THE DIFFICULT
QUESTIONS WITH THE MUELLER
PROBE.
THEY SEEM TO TRUST IT
IMPLICITLY.
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT TAKES TO
TWITTER AND HE SAYS, WHO WAS
TREATED WORSE, AL CAPONE OR PAUL
MANAFORT AND DRIVING ATTENTION
TO A TRIAL THAT WAS ALREADY
BEING COVERED, BUT MAYBE NOT
BEING COVERED CONSTANTLY.
ILL  * THAT WAS AN INSTANT TRUMP
TWEET.
SLIDING SCALE, EVERYTHING IS
COMPARATIVE -- EVES
COMPARATIVE -- EVERYTHING IS
SUBJECTIVE.
THE FIRST THING HE DID WHEN
MANAFORT WAS INDICTED.
HE SAID WELL, WHAT WALL MAN FOR
NOT NEARLY AS BAD PASS WHAT WAS
DONE BY HILLARY CLINTON.
CAPRI: SHOULD YOU NOT BE ASKING
QUESTIONS OF HILLARY CLINTON WHO
HAD A SPY GET SOURCING FROM THE
KREMLIN TO GET SOURCES INTO THE
ELECTION?
CAPRI: THE MANAFORT TRIAL
ONE OF THE THINGS TRUMP PUT IN
HIS TWEETS.
BASICALLY EVERYTHING IN THIS
TRIAL PREDATES MANAFORT'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO GET THAT
ON TO THIS MANAFORT TRIAL.
BREAKING COUNT AL CAPONE TWEET.
YOU SEE "SAYS INQUIRY" TALKING
ABOUT IT.
HOWIE: THIS RALLY WENT ON IN
OHIO.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: MSNBC IS SO
CORRUPT.
IT'S SO DISGUSTING.
SO DISGUSTING.
THE GUYS THAT WE LOVE, RIGHT?
THEY ARE BLOWING THEM AWAY IN
THE RACE.
HANNITY, LAURA INGRAHAM, TUCKER
CARLSON.
STEVE DOOCY.
I AM NOT SURE IT HELPS FOX WHEN
HE BRINGS IN THE OPINION HOSTS
LIKE THAT.
IT SUGGESTS THE ENTIRE NETWORK
NARRATIVE THAT THERE IS A
PREFERRED NETWORK THAT MAY HAVE
A SPECIFIC BIAS AND EVERYONE
4,000 VIEWERS INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH SHOW FOX NEWS AS NUMBER
TWO AS THE MOST OF TRUSTED NEWS
BY MOST OF AMERICAN VIEWERS THAT
WERE SURVEYED.
NUMBER 1 WAS 
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT USED THE
WORD DISGUSTING AT THE
PENNSYLVANIA RALLY.
THIS MORNING HE TWEETED THEY
PURPOSELY CAUSED DISTRUST ANSWER
THEY ALSO CAUSE WAR.
STRAIGHT.
WHEN YOU BEHAVE IN SUCH A
CLOWNISH FASHION WHERE THEY ARE
OPEN ABOUT HOW THEY VIEW THEIR
JOB AS RESISTING HIM.
PEOPLE.
A RECENT POLL SHOWS 72% OF
AND MISLEADING INFORMATION.
THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE UNTIL
SUCH TIME AS THE MEDIA TAKE
THEIR JOBS MORE SERIOUSLY AND
START COVERING HIM STRAIGHT.
THOUGH I DO NOT LIKE THE
INACCURATE MEDIA ABOUT ME, BUT I
DO NOT VIEW THE MEDIA AS THE KEN
ANY OF THE PEOPLE.
GILLIAN: THERE IS A REASON THE
PRESIDENT GETS PUSHBACK ON
COMMENTS FROM THE LEFT.
AND NOT FROM REPUBLICANS,
LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL.
OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
IT'S BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF
THIS COMES FROM THE IDEA THE
PRESIDENT IS EXPRESSING A
