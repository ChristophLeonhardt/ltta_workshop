we would first of all if we see somebody drinking more than usual or asking different groove for the drinks we tried to communicate between us all first to say maybe stop the passenger or the customer from drinking after that if they continue or if they've managed to find a loophole we would probably assess them and suggest drinking water or go to the seats and having coffee how you sleep but if they become quite aggressive we have different threat levels that we can adhere to and I think if they get to level three which normally involves any physical contact with another passenger or crew as in punching kicking then we would have what we would call a passenger restraint situation where we would go in guns blazing and make sure the passenger is restraint in the seeds we have body buckles and and we do get restraint training as well which does help so we've we've got somewhere some ninja moves that we can pull out enough oxygen
