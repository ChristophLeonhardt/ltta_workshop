if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey there's that</font>

38
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,370
but getting to the main issue I went and

39
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,130
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black fish today with my husband</font>

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,989
him and I had a little midday date we do

41
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,019
that sometimes and went to go see it it

42
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,000
was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a it's a tough documentary to</font>

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
watch but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a documentary that is</font>

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,350
worth watching definitely and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they kind</font>

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,650
of more or less focus on one particular

46
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,459
whale and his struggle he's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

47
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,940
large and because of that

48
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,370
you know highly sought out for and

49
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,740
desired for his sperm basically then

50
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,930
they start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with capturing him when</font>

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,360
he's just a young calf with his mother

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,240
and then bringing him to not even a

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,190
SeaWorld location technically but like a

54
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,820
different type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Park and how he</font>

55
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,160
attacks a woman there and then ends up

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,090
in to SeaWorld hands and death ensues

57
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,400
and he is still<font color="#CCCCCC"> alive the whale that</font>

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
they focus on he's still alive in

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,270
orlando now but he lives a very solitary

60
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,960
life watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentary really</font>

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,280
made me think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know like am I</font>

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,000
gonna take my future kids to SeaWorld

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you know knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean I feel like</font>

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I always kind of knew I feel like most</font>

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,150
people kind of know you know I grew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

66
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,960
in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Antonio and that was the big</font>

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,360
thing to do was to go to SeaWorld um

68
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,870
when you were younger at its core at

69
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,330
least from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my perspective you know being</font>

70
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,640
there when I was in high school and

71
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,800
working there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then also growing up</font>

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,340
there at its<font color="#CCCCCC"> core it's like you see the</font>

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,750
kids excitement when they come to the

74
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,370
park you see the kids excitement when

75
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,110
they see the shows you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids</font>

76
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,640
excitement when they see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Penguins</font>

77
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this and that and the fact that</font>

78
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,700
you're educating them on marine life

79
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,860
it's almost it kind of questions like do

80
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,019
the ends justify the means kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing</font>

81
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,510
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day you know</font>

82
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,160
if you're a kid and you're visiting

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">SeaWorld at the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

84
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,640
a sense of wonderment you have a sense

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,950
of amazement at these beautiful marine

86
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,750
animals that you should respect and love

87
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and so forth but if that whole</font>

88
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,530
ideology is kind of masked under this

89
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:44,110
horrid truth you know um so it's it's a

90
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,780
tough call point of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story is black</font>

91
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,210
fish is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should go check</font>

92
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,970
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I think it'll spark some debate</font>

93
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,190
or discussion if you go with a group of

94
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,950
friends

95
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,280
so definitely see it I think it's worth

96
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,520
it and I'm probably never going to

97
00:05:01,520 --> 00:00:00,000
seaworld ever again in my entire life
