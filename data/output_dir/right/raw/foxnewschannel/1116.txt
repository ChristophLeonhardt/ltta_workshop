1
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:02,857
SPOKE OUT TO SAY HE HOPES THE

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:04,826
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO USE HIS

3
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:08,530
CLEMENCY POWER TO SAVE LIVES.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,265
>> Sandra: HERE NOW,

5
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:11,199
MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,201
OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS,

7
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:17,472
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND HOST OF

8
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,407
"HUCKABEE" ON SATURDAY AND

9
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:20,475
SUNDAY NIGHTS ON TBN.

10
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,477
I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE AND NOW

11
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:24,012
A STORY THAT IS VERY NEAR AND

12
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,047
DEAR TO YOUR HEART.

13
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:30,218
DID YOU AGREE WITH THIS MOVE BY

14
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:30,685
THE PRESIDENT?

15
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,855
>> I REALLY DID, SANDRA.

16
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,056
AND I APPRECIATE KIM KARDASHIAN

17
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,492
WEST FOR USING HER CELEBRITY FOR

18
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:39,260
SOMETHING THAT DOES GOOD.

19
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,095
I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF PEOPLE

20
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:41,663
WANT TO LOCK FOLKS UP AND KEEP

21
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:43,231
THEM THERE FOREVER, BUT 22 YEARS

22
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:47,235
FOR A FIRST TIME, NONVIOLENT

23
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:48,069
OFFENDER?

24
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:50,038
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS

25
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:50,972
AMERICA THAT HAVE MURDERED

26
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:51,840
PEOPLE THAT WILL NEVER SERVE

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,275
EVEN A THIRD OF THAT AMOUNT OF

28
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:55,276
TIME.

29
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:57,879
MY PRESENT DIRECTOR IN ARKANSAS,

30
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,314
LARRY NORIS, USED TO SAY, WE

31
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:00,849
LOCK A LOT OF PEOPLE UP THAT WE

32
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:02,750
ARE MAD AT, RATHER THAN THE ONES

33
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,486
WE ARE AFRAID OF.

34
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:07,856
THE FACT IS, OVER $33,000 PER

35
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:10,258
YEAR PER INMATE, AVERAGE, WHICH

36
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:11,493
COULD BE A SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS

37
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:15,063
75 OR 80,000 PER YEAR IS NOT

38
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:15,663
WORKING.

39
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:17,465
IT'S NOT HELPING US RESOLVE THE

40
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:18,666
CRIME PROBLEM.

41
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,135
THE TRUTH IS, SANDRA, WE DON'T

42
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:22,237
HAVE A CRIME PROBLEM SO MUCH AS

43
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:23,805
A DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROBLEM.

44
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,673
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WE

45
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:27,075
INCARCERATE NEED TO BE IN

46
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:27,642
TREATMENT CENTERS.

47
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:28,776
I APPLAUD THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

48
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,678
IT TOOK A LOT OF GUTS FOR HIM TO

49
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:31,679
DO THIS.

50
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:34,115
THERE IS NEVER, EVER AS A

51
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,085
POLITICAL UPSIDE TO GRANTING ANY

52
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,287
TYPE OF CLEMENCY VIET

53
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:42,090
COMMUTATION WERE A PART IN.

54
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,292
>> Sandra: IT'S FASCINATING

55
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:45,293
AND CAPTURING THE ATTENTION OF

56
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,094
THE NATION.

57
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:47,829
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT

58
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:50,331
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING ON THIS

59
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:54,669
HIGH PROFILE CLEMENCY SPREE.

60
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,738
HE'S TALKING ABOUT MORE PARDONS

61
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,239
AND COMMUTING ALICE JOHNSON.

62
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,475
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE GOAL IS OF

63
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:00,909
THE PRESIDENT?

64
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:04,112
WHAT IS HE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE AS

65
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:04,612
THE BIG PICTURE?

66
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:07,282
>> Mike: I THINK TWO THINGS,

67
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,050
ONE, HE'S LOOKING AT EACH CASE

68
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,119
INDIVIDUALLY WHICH IS EXACTLY

69
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,254
WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD

70
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:13,655
DO.

71
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:22,096
THEY SHOULD NEVER SAY, BLANK IT.

72
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:22,864
I'M ISSUING A COMMUTATIONS.

73
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:27,268
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY CASE

74
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:27,702
INDIVIDUALLY.

75
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:29,337
BUT HE'S ALSO POINTING OUT SOME

76
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:31,839
OF THE TOTAL FAILURES IN OUR

77
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:34,409
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND

78
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,544
SENTENCING GUIDELINES.

79
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:40,281
IT WAS VERY POPULAR A FEW YEARS

80
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,549
AGO, IF YOU SAID THAT AT A

81
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:44,686
ROTARY MEETING, YOU GOT A LOT OF

82
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:45,053
APPLAUSE.

83
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,654
BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE DUMBEST

84
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:48,223
MOVES WE'VE EVER MADE AND IT

85
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:50,191
COSTS NOT ONLY AN ENORMOUS

86
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,626
AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT IT RUINED OF

87
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,661
THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD NO

88
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:54,862
BUSINESS BEING IN PRISON FOR

89
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:58,066
LIFE, FOR LET'S SAY THREE OR

90
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:58,466
$400 THEFTS.

91
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,935
IT'S DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE

92
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:01,436
CRIME COMMITTED.

93
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:02,770
>> Sandra: I WANT TO GET THIS

94
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,106
IN HERE, AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN

95
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:07,508
UP MORE ABOUT WHO ALICE MARIE

96
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:08,343
JOHNSON IS.

97
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:10,578
53 YEARS OLD AND WE ARE BEING

98
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,714
TOLD THAT SHE OFFICIALLY AND HAS

99
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,716
BEEN RELEASED FROM THE FEDERAL

100
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:15,049
PRISON.

101
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,720
SHE WAS SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE.

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,089
IT'S A REMARKABLE STORY.

103
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,825
WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE,

104
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:25,493
AT A CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION IN

105
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,527
THE STATE OF ALABAMA.

106
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:30,064
MOTHER OF FIVE, GREAT

107
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:31,065
GRANDMOTHER OF SIX AND A

108
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:31,766
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER OF ONE

109
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:35,670
AND SHE HAS NOW WALKED OUT OF

110
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,571
THAT FEDERAL PRISON.

111
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:38,273
>> Mike: AND I'M GLAD SHE HAS.

112
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:40,475
THINK ABOUT THIS, LIFE WITHOUT

113
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:40,808
PAROLE.

114
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:41,876
THAT IS THE KIND OF SENTENCE YOU

115
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:43,544
GIVE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

116
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:44,112
COMMITTED MASS MURDER.

117
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,213
THAT'S A KIND OF SENTENCE YOU

118
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:48,383
GIVE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE CREATED

119
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:50,652
A SAVAGE COP KILLING.

120
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:53,821
BUT FOR A NONVIOLENT, FIRST-TIME

121
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:54,555
DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGE?

122
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,858
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT SERIOUS

123
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:57,659
TO TRAFFIC DRUGS BUT I AM SAYING

124
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,894
THAT THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH A

125
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:02,263
DRUG PROBLEM IS NOT JUST TO LOCK

126
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:03,698
PEOPLE UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY

127
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:04,866
COME AND SPEND THE TAXPAYERS

128
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:05,300
MONEY.

129
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,568
IT MIGHT BE TO PUT THOSE PEOPLE

130
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:08,503
IN TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND THEN

131
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:11,272
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO

132
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:11,939
LONG-TERM ADVANTAGE TO JUST

133
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,342
LOCKING PEOPLE UP AND MAKING

134
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:15,476
SURE THEY ARE CAGED FOR THE REST

135
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:17,879
OF THEIR LIVES.

136
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,745
>> Sandra: I'M SORRY TO CUT

137
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,050
YOU OFF, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

138
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,685
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION, TO BE

139
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:24,752
CLEAR, THAT HAS SHOWN TO BE VERY

140
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:28,790
TOUGH ON CRIME.

141
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,592
AND I SAY THAT, AS WE NOW KNOW

142
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:32,894
THAT JARED KUSHNER, THE

143
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,095
PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW, MET

144
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,097
SEVERAL TIMES WITH

145
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:39,667
MISS KARDASHIAN LEADING UP TO

146
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:44,472
THIS, IN THE MONTHS TO LEADING

147
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:46,741
UP TO HER RELEASE FROM PRISON.

148
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:48,109
>> Mike: THERE ARE SOME THINGS

149
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:49,277
FOR WHICH PEOPLE SHOULD BE

150
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:52,947
LOCKED UP FOR LIFE, THERE ARE

151
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:55,983
SOME CRIMES THAT      THAT ARE H

152
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:56,017
SOME CRIMES THAT      THAT ARE I

153
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:56,050
SOME CRIMES THAT      THAT ARE O

154
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,084
SOME CRIMES THAT      THAT ARE S

155
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:56,317
SOME CRIMES THAT      THAT ARE .

156
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,420
I HAD TO CARRY IT OUT AS

157
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,787
GOVERNOR.

158
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:01,422
I DIDN'T ENJOY IT, BUT THERE ARE

159
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:02,790
SOME CRIMES FOR WHICH THAT IS AN

160
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,059
APPROPRIATE ADJUDICATION.

161
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:07,061
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST GO AROUND AND

162
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,629
PUT EVERYONE IN A LOCK UP.

163
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,865
SO WHAT YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO

164
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,066
REALIZE THAT WHEN PEOPLE COME

165
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:14,535
OUT AS A FELON COME UP THEY

166
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:16,070
CAN'T EVEN GET A JOB EMPTYING A

167
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,705
BEDPAN IN A NURSING HOME BECAUSE

168
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:18,439
WE HAVE CREATED BACKGROUND

169
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,876
CHECKS THAT SAY, IF YOU HAVE A

170
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,277
CONVICTION, MOST JOBS HE WILL

171
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:24,078
NEVER BE ABLE TO DO.

172
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:25,913
HOW DOES THAT HELP US IN THE

173
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:27,949
LONG TERM?

174
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,118
THE TRUTH IS, IT DOESN'T.

175
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:31,285
>> Sandra: FASCINATING STUFF,

176
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:33,955
AND I'M SURE WE WILL LEARN MORE

177
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:36,657
ABOUT THESE WOMEN.

178
00:05:36,657 --> 00:00:00,000
THOSE WILL LIVE ON FOREVER.
