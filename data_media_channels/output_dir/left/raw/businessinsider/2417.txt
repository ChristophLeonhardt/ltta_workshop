00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,029
demonstrated just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power of community</font>

corporations now doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what what</font>

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,960
are your other clients yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,669
interesting applications are largely

8
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,500
around fundraising for say public

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,079
broadcasting how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you enable people to</font>

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,440
not just participate in the on-air sort

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,030
of pledge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun but actually have an</font>

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,620
ongoing communication with them by email

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other forms of online communication</font>

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,970
in the in the corporate sector how do

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,680
you mobilize employees around your CSR

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,450
efforts how do you make your you know

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,870
corporate responsibility more deeply

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,490
integrated into your day to day what's

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,590
the answer I think it's some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes</font>

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,180
to just transparent messaging I mean

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,670
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> action-oriented getting them to</font>

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,930
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things when you ask people to do</font>

23
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,430
things they do them and they expect to

24
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">be treated differently so the way the</font>

25
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,180
Obama campaign worked on the grand

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,950
scheme that high level of 14 million

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,740
people is lots of segments<font color="#CCCCCC"> of knowing</font>

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,060
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to do in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your behalf</font>

29
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,740
what they've done for you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,030
managing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is such that the</font>

31
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,350
relationships are about more real-time

32
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,509
and more reliable one of the successes

33
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,700
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Obama campaign was mobilizing all</font>

34
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,020
these different tiers of people who

35
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,399
became advocates<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they got all their</font>

36
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,530
friends in the campaign obviously it

37
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,880
gets a lot trickier when you go to a

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporation and it would the strategy be</font>

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,289
the same are you getting forward owners

40
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,810
to evangelize the cars how do you incent

41
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,549
them to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah and I think you I</font>

42
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:35,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you really can I think the level</font>

43
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:36,939
of passion is obviously going to be

44
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">different there has to be more of a</font>

45
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,630
giveaway<font color="#CCCCCC"> more of an incentive but</font>

46
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,249
through on the ground events at

47
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,109
dealerships for example along with

48
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">loyalty programs and service guarantees</font>

49
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,859
and everything you can bundle things

50
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,389
together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we did you know</font>

51
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,880
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the campaign wasn't just</font>

52
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,130
about Barack Obama it ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you know</font>

53
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,840
of the videos the content the messaging

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,249
it became as much about the individual

55
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,020
supporters on the ground as it was so

56
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,670
how do you invert that model in the

57
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,719
corporate world so it's not just

58
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,700
marketing from the ivory tower of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,469
corporate headquarters but about that

60
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,179
sort of fostering that brand loyalty

61
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:08,679
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a broad base of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is anyone doing</font>

62
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,240
that well in the corporate world I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

63
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,349
there's some interesting campaigns

64
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,590
happening but it's it's not terribly

65
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,550
organic

66
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,860
a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> campaigns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we see even</font>

67
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,690
on air that have loyal customers

68
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,020
interviewed<font color="#E5E5E5"> their casted their casted</font>

69
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,510
things there's casting calls and makeup

70
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,950
rooms<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else what you need to</font>

71
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">do for commercials how does the online</font>

72
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,450
world then have a more authentic more

73
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,330
accessible approach we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot about</font>

74
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,920
sort of lower in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> barrier to entry</font>

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,720
while raising the level of expectations

76
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,700
so how do you allow a consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play a</font>

77
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,620
role in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing campaign and keep</font>

78
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,450
that relationship going I think it's

79
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,950
about authenticity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trust in the</font>

80
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">message but when you get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the more</font>

81
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate for-profit world there's got</font>

82
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,010
to be that that incentive whether that's

83
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,440
in pricing whether that's in you know

84
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,790
some sort of loyalty program that has

85
00:02:54,790 --> 00:00:00,000
benefits in a traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>
