1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,059
>>BERNIE SANDERS SAID ON SUNDAY
THAT HE WANTS TO SEE A

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,910
REVOLUTION IN THIS COUNTRY IN
THE WAY THAT WE TREAT WOMEN.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,910
TAKE A LOOK.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,269
>>AL FRANKEN INDICATED THAT HE
WAS GOING TO RESIGN, AND I THINK

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:19,440
WHAT FRANKEN DID TOUCHES ON AN
ISSUE OF IN NORMA'S CONSEQUENCE

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,960
FOR THIS COUNTRY.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,099
AND WHAT I
WORRY ABOUT, JAY, IS NOT JUST

8
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:26,460
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH REGARD
TO FAMOUS PEOPLE, WE SEE THAT IN

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,939
THE PAPERS EVERY DAY WHETHER
IT'S THE MEDIA, THE CORPORATE

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:33,130
WORLD, OR IN POLITICS -- RIGHT
NOW AS WE SPEAK IN RESTAURANTS

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,800
ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, IN
OFFICES ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY,

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,940
THERE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT
FAMOUS WHO ARE HARASSING WOMEN,

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,180
MAKING DEMANDS ON WOMEN, THAT
ARE OBSCENE, AND WE NEED A

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,920
REVOLUTION IN THE WAY WE TREAT
WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE FROM THE

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
BOTTOM ON UP.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,580
>>THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT
POINT BERNIE SANDERS MADE AND I

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,030
WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CRUCIAL

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,100
THAT WE RECOGNIZE THIS.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,310
THE ME
TOO MOVEMENT HAS BEEN SO

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,530
EMPOWERING AND SO AFFECTED IN SO
MANY WAYS.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,530
THAT SAID, IT'S A

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,000
MOVEMENT FOR THE PRIVILEGED.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,150
MOST OF THE PEOPLE COMING OUT

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,610
OUR FAMOUS WOMEN, THEY ARE RICH
WHITE WOMEN, FRANKLY, AND IT'S

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,090
LEAVING OUT AN ENTIRE
DEMOGRAPHIC OF WOMEN WHO CANNOT

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,510
COME FORWARD AND SAY ME TOO.

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,290
NOW, THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,760
ARE SEXY HARASSED OR SEXUALLY
ABUSED ARE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,310
SERVICE INDUSTRY, AND THOSE ARE
WOMEN WHO MAY BE OUR IN HOTEL

30
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,710
ROOMS ALONE WITH GUESTS WHO THEY
CANNOT COME OUT AGAINST, OR IF

31
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,229
IT IS -- IF THEY ARE IN A
RESTAURANT AND IT'S SOMEONE THEY

32
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,230
ARE WAITING A TABLE ON,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OR IF THEY

33
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,781
ARE A HOUSEKEEPER AND THERE IS
NO UNION TO PROTECT THEM, THEIR

34
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:43,990
BOSS IS THE PERSON WHO IS
SEXUALLY HARASSING OR ABUSING

35
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,229
THEM, THERE IS NO H.R.
DEPARTMENT OR ANYTHING LIKE

36
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,229
THAT.

37
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,680
THESE WOMEN ARE BEING LEFT
OUT OF THIS MOVEMENT, WE ARE

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,310
FORGETTING THE WOMEN IN THIS
MOVEMENT AS WE TRY TO COMBAT

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,230
THIS HORRENDOUS AND UBIQUITOUS
PROBLEM.

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,290
I WANT TO SHARE YOU A

41
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,800
CHART THAT TALKS ABOUT THE TOTAL
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES FILED

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,580
BY INDUSTRY BETWEEN 2005 AND
2015.

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,580
KEEP IN MIND WHILE LOOKING

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,790
AT THIS THAT THESE NUMBERS
AREN'T TOTALLY REPRESENTATIVE

45
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,878
BECAUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ONE
OF THE MOST UNDERREPORTED CRIMES

46
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,529
THAT WE HAVE, SO THESE NUMBERS
MIGHT BE MUCH BIGGER, MUCH

47
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:16,730
GREATER, ESPECIALLY IN THE
SERVICE INDUSTRY WHERE WOMEN MAY

48
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,810
NOT FEEL THAT THEY CAN COME OUT
AND REPORT THESE THINGS.

49
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,810
LET'S

50
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,120
LOOK AT THIS, THE TOP REPORTING
ARE ACCOMMODATION AND FOOD

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,349
SERVICES, THE RETAIL TRADE,
HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL

52
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,019
ASSISTANCE, ADMINISTRATIVE
SUPPORT, WASTE MANAGEMENT,

53
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,010
REMEDIATION, ALL THESE SORTS OF
SERVICE INDUSTRIES.

54
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,010
THEN YOU

55
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,079
LOOK DOWN AT 1.61%, THAT IS
ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND

56
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,079
RECREATION.

57
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,269
IT FEELS LIKE EVERY
SINGLE DAY WE SEE ANOTHER

58
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,939
ACTRESS OR MUSICIAN COMING
FORWARD TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL

59
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:47,069
HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL ABUSE, THAT
ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR 1.61% OF THESE

60
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,560
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES, AND
WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,370
MAJORITY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
THAT HAPPENING IT'S WITHIN THESE

62
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,370
SERVICE INDUSTRIES AND WE ARE
COMPLETELY LEAVING BEHIND THESE

63
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,060
LOW INCOME WOMEN, OFTENTIMES
WOMEN OF COLOR, AND WE NEED TO

64
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,310
CHANGE THAT AND START FROM THE
BOTTOM UP JUST LIKE BERNIE

65
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,719
SANDERS IS TALKING ABOUT.

66
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,579
>>DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE OTHER
DAY, WHEN I WAS HERE LAST WEEK,

67
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,480
THAT WHEN I WENT TO BREAKFAST
WITH YOU I LEFT RELIEVED THAT

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,849
YOU WEREN'T A PERVERT?

69
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,349
ISN'T
THAT THE SENSIBILITY OF ALL

70
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,590
WOMEN, THAT WHEN WE HAVE TO
ENCOUNTER A MAN IN A POSITION OF

71
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,809
POWER, ESPECIALLY SOMEONE WHO IS
FAR MORE EMPOWERED THAN WE ARE,

72
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:27,139
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING IN
A SITUATION THAT IS

73
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,779
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE IT IS SO
EMBEDDED IN OUR CULTURE.

74
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:32,779
AND

75
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,489
THEY ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE
GIRLS AT APPLEBEE'S.

76
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,489
AND WHEN I

77
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,889
WORK AT THE COMEDY CLUB, BECAUSE
I'M THE HEADLINER THAT WEEKEND,

78
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,799
I ENCOUNTER SOMEONE BEING
INAPPROPRIATE WITH ME, SO I

79
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,829
ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE SERVERS
THAT ARE THERE.

80
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,829
BECAUSE IF I SAY

81
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,749
SOMETHING, SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN,
BUT THOSE GIRLS CAN LOSE THEIR

82
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:50,749
JOBS.

83
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,349
EVEN THE OTHER DAY WHEN
YOU ASKED ME ABOUT RUSSELL

84
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,799
SIMMONS, I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
BECAUSE HE'S A PRODUCER OF

85
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,209
COMEDY SHOWS AND IF I SAY THE
WRONG THING ABOUT RUSSELL

86
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,549
SIMMONS I MAY NOT WORK IN A
COMEDY SHOW AGAIN.

87
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,549
WE ALWAYS

88
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,159
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE
THINGS.

89
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,629
THIS IS A CULTURAL

90
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:07,629
ISSUE.

91
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,969
WHERE IN THE WORLD CAN
YOU GO THAT WOMEN DON'T FEEL

92
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:15,469
THAT THEY ARE BEING -- THAT THEY
ARE SECOND-BEST?

93
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:16,469
IT'S

94
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:18,709
EVERYWHERE, IT'S IN EVERYTHING,
AND I DO AGREE WITH BERNIE.

95
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,709
WE

96
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,889
HAVE TO HAVE A PARADIGM SHIFT,
AND IT BEGINS WITH THE EDUCATION

97
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,449
OF OUR BOYS.

98
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,460
THE BIGGEST
FEMINIST IN OUR HOUSE IS MY SON.

99
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,889
MY DAUGHTER KNOWS, I TALKED TO
HER ABOUT IT, BUT I HAD TO

100
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,190
EDUCATE MY SON ON HOW TO TREAT
WOMEN.

101
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,220
>>YOU TOLD ME THAT STORY OFF
THE AIR ABOUT THE BREAKFAST, AND

102
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,289
IT WAS A REALLY INTERESTING
PERSPECTIVE, I NEVER THOUGHT OF

103
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,570
IT THAT WAY.

104
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,139
I GO TO BREAKFAST
MEETINGS ALL THE TIME, I DON'T

105
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,340
THINK TWICE ABOUT IT, BUT FROM
YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU WENT

106
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,280
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT A SHOW, YOU
HAD TO BE CONCERNED, IS HE THIS

107
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,890
TYPE OF GUY OR THAT TYPE OF GUY?

108
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,150
AND WHEN YOU SAID THAT TO ME I

109
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,169
WAS LIKE, WOW, I'VE NEVER HAD TO
GO TO ANY MEETING, BREAKFAST OR

110
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:08,229
OTHERWISE, WHERE I THOUGHT MIGHT
I BE IN DANGER?

111
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,229
AND WHAT MIGHT

112
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:11,629
HAPPEN HERE THAT PUTS ME IN AN
AWKWARD SPOT?

113
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:12,629
SO TRY TO THINK

114
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:15,850
ABOUT THE SHOE BEING ON THE
OTHER FOOT AND BROADEN YOUR

115
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,850
PERSPECTIVE HERE.

116
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,169
AND FOR WHAT
BERNIE SAID, I KNOW WHY THE

117
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,270
MEDIA COVERS OTHER STUFF MORE,
AND IT'S VERY LOGICAL.

118
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,270
EVERYBODY

119
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,370
KNOWS HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND KEVIN
SPACEY, A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THE

120
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,560
ACCUSERS, ASHLEY JUDD, ETC., SO
IT'S HARD TO RESIST THAT STORY,

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,220
AND YOU SHOULDN'T. AND IN FACT
COVERING THAT 1.6% HAS LED TO, I

122
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,919
THINK, AND AWAKENING THAT HAS
AFFECTED THE REST OF THE CULTURE

123
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,919
AND SOCIETY, SO I THINK IT'S
BEEN A GREAT MOVEMENT OVERALL.

124
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,010
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY, I'M NOT
SURE WHAT THE ANSWER IS, TO GET

125
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,500
THE HELP FOR OTHER WOMEN WHO
NEED IT WHEN IT'S NOT AS

126
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,819
INTERESTING TO THE REST OF THE
MEDIA TO COVER IT.

127
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:58,280
>>YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,220
ASHLEY JUDDS OF THE WORLD, ROSE
MCGOWAN, LUPITA NYONG'O, CAME

129
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,110
OUT BECAUSE THE EXPEDITED THIS
CULTURAL SHIFT IN THE WAY PEOPLE

130
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,039
COULD GRASP ONTO BECAUSE THEY
ARE TANGIBLE, WE KNOW WHO THEY

131
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,009
ARE, THEY HAVE NAME RECOGNITION
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY

132
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,259
COME FORWARD, AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT THINGS SHIFT FROM THE TOP

133
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,259
DOWN AS WELL.

134
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,110
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE HAVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

135
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,580
TRAINING IN CONGRESS AND THE
SENATE, WE MAKE MORE LAWS TO TRY

136
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,719
TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF THING
FROM HAPPENING, BUT I THINK WHAT

137
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:34,400
AIDA IS GETTING AT AND WHAT IS
IMPORTANT, OBVIOUSLY THE

138
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,760
PUNISHMENT OF THE MEN WHO DO
THESE THINGS AND COMMIT THESE

139
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,870
SORTS OF ACTS IS CRUCIAL TO THIS
SHIFT WE SEE, BUT IT'S ALSO

140
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,030
REALLY ABOUT EDUCATION.

141
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,960
FOR
WOMEN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,690
CENK, IT'S NOT IF WE ARE GOING
TO GET SEXY HARASSED, OR IF WE

143
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,210
ARE GOING TO GET SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED, IT'S WHEN.

144
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,460
THAT IS

145
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,449
THE REALITY OF WHAT IT MEANS TO
BE A WOMAN.

146
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,449
YOU CAN GO TO ONE

147
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,740
MEETING AND IT COULD BE OKAY,
THEN THE NEXT MEETING IT'S NOT.

148
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,840
SO FOR THESE WOMEN WHO HAVE
THESE ESTABLISHED CAREERS AND

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,030
HAVE THE PLATFORM TO COME
FORWARD, I APPLAUD THEM, BUT IF

150
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,449
YOU ARE YOUNGER, IF YOU DON'T
HAVE AN ESTABLISHED CAREER, IF

151
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,960
YOU ARE IN A LOW INCOME JOB, IF
YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR, IT'S

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,560
NOT SO EASY, SO WE NEED TO
PROVIDE A NET FOR THEM TO COME

153
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,629
FORWARD ABOUT THESE THINGS, WE
NEED TO PROVIDE THEM PROTECTION,

154
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,479
AND WE REALLY NEED TO PROVIDE AN
EDUCATION FOR OUR BOYS THAT IT'S

155
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,360
NOT OKAY TO EXERT YOUR POWER IN
THESE WAYS AND IT'S NOT OKAY TO

156
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,099
HOLD THESE BELIEFS THAT YOU CAN
SPEAK ABOUT, ACT AROUND WOMEN,

157
00:07:42,099 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THESE WAYS.
