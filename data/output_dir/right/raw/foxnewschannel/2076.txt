00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:09,857
GREG: SHOULD WE CREDIT HIM FOR

2
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:11,992
CHANGING KIM.

3
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,661
DENNIS RODMAN SAYS HE DESERVE AS

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:15,963
PAT ON THE BACK IN THE NORTH

5
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:17,398
KOREAN SUMMIT HAPPENS.

6
00:00:17,398 --> 00:00:20,167
HE WAS MAKING NICE WITH KIM

7
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:21,969
JONG-UN LONG BEFORE HE THOUGHT A

8
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,804
SUMMIT WAS POSSIBLE.

9
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:26,907
HE BROUGHT A COPY OF "THE ART OF

10
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:29,777
THE DEAL" ON HIS LAST VISIT.

11
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:30,644
>> IMPRESSIVE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP

12
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,313
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY

13
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,582
HAVE A CHANGE OF HEATER.

14
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:36,817
GREG: BUT BACK THEN EVERYONE

15
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:38,152
THOUGHT RODMAN WAS NUTS TO GO

16
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:38,886
OVER THERE.

17
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:41,989
HE WAS VILIFIED BUSINESS

18
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:42,022
HE WAS VILIFIED BYSINESS

19
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:42,056
HE WAS VILIFIED BY HNESS

20
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:42,189
HE WAS VILIFIED BY HISSS

21
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:42,923
HE WAS VILIFIED BY HIS OWN

22
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,491
NATION.

23
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:45,960
IN 2014 SOME JERK HAD THE NERVE

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,928
TO SAY DENNIS RODMAN IS ANOTHER

25
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:51,365

26
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:51,665
JERK.

27
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:54,134
WHICH WAS THE POLITE WAY OF

28
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:54,535
SAYING THIS.

29
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:56,270
>> HE'S A WIMP.

30
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,105
AFTER ALL HE'S GOING THERE TO

31
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:01,542
CELEBRATE HIS BUD'S BIRTHDAY.

32
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:05,045
RODMAN IS THE MARILYN MONROE TO

33
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,314
KIM JONG-UN'S JFK.

34
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:19,927
HE'S LITTLE KIM'S LITTLE BITCH.

35
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:21,228
GREG: HANDSOME FELLOW BUT VERY

36
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:21,528
NAIVE.

37
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:22,496
DID NOT AGE WELL.

38
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:25,266
I TELL YOU WHAT, TO JUST TO MAKE

39
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:28,736
AMENDS, IF THIS SUMMIT HAPPENS I

50
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:49,456
ONE LOOK AT HIS IMPRESSIVE

51
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:54,361
RESUME AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY

52
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:54,828
WHY.

ELECTRA WHO QUICKLY DIVORCED

58
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:08,508
HIM.

59
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,511
SOON AFTER HE FINISHED HIS

63
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:21,956

00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:24,091
WAS HE ALWAYS A FIGHTER?

65
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,126
WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO WEAR

66
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:28,796
BRIGHTLY DYED HAIR IN PUBLIC,

67
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:29,930

AND HE DIT QUIT.

72
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:38,973
