1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,699
Unification is way down the road,

2
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:04,080
so that's the ultimate goal
that everyone says they want,

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,860
but no one thinks they're
very close to that.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,610
(delicate music)

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,411
South Korea is so much
wealthier, more powerful,

6
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,518
it's just a totally
different type of country

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,891
than North Korea now that
it's hard to imagine them

8
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,451
unifying in any sort of easy way.

9
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:27,080
Society's have grown so far
apart, so I think that the

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,520
South Koreans would see
North Korea as a burden,

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,118
they'd have to invest an
enormous amount of money

12
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:34,000
to rebuild North Korea, reeducate,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,109
or at least deal with
the costs of unification.

14
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:41,640
We have a country essentially
living in a dark period

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,000
where they have very
little internet access.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,491
It's not like any other
country in the world;

17
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,880
North Korea is one of the
most isolated, closed off,

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,837
totalitarian societies in the world.

19
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:52,221
South Korea, on the flip
side, is one of the most open,

20
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,931
free, technologically savvy
societies in the world.

21
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,680
So, to combine those
seems almost unbelievable,

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,400
especially the younger generations

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,771
in both countries have really no memory

24
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,840
of any connection between the two sides.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,800
There's not a huge
amount of popular support

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,771
in South Korea for unification.

27
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,211
People talk about it as
it's something that's great,

28
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:13,760
but they I think recognize how
different the countries are

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,299
and how unbelievably costly and difficult

30
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:20,337
an actual unification would be.

31
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,908
The main obstacles, I think,
are North Korea's difficult

32
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,737
relations with all the other
countries besides South Korea,

33
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:27,926
and that includes the
United States and China.

34
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:29,558
The real sticking point
is that technically

35
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:32,469
the United States and
North Korea are still

36
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,748
in an armed conflict, meaning
that the end of the Korean War

37
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,606
it was just a ceasefire, they never really

38
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:40,878
formally resolved all
the issues from that war.

39
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:44,008
And so that's why US troops
are still in South Korea,

40
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,587
and that's why they're all pretty much

41
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:48,109
on armed alert, they
could fight at any time.

42
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,698
Resolving those sort of
international complications

43
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:54,067
is really the bigger
obstacle, much less getting

44
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,789
to the question of what the
Koreas want from each other.

45
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,389
Unification is way down the road,

46
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,617
so that's the ultimate goal
that everyone says they want,

47
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:03,549
but no one thinks they're
very close to that.

48
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,149
I think what they would
want is de-escalation.

49
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,881
Maybe everyone agrees to
take down their nukes.

50
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:12,340
The US is ready- removed
all nuclear weapons

51
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,470
from South Korea and
the idea North Koreans

52
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,830
would shut down their nuclear program.

53
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,590
And then, some sort of
peace agreement with the

54
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,280
United States, and then
everyone starts pulling back

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,062
their troops from the demilitarized zone,

56
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,972
so that not everyone's ready
to shoot at a moment's notice.

57
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:30,350
Only at that point can they really talk

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,986
about some sort of unification.

59
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,807
I think regular exchanges where they start

60
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:36,469
opening up travel between
North Korea and South Korea.

61
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,188
They've done some cooperative projects

62
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:39,916
where they have these sort of peace zones

63
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,826
where they- South Koreans build stuff

64
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,483
and North Koreans and South Koreans can

65
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:45,608
sort of work together in some small zones.

66
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:48,000
I think that's what we
can imagine happening

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,370
after the nuclear crisis is solved.

68
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,761
Unification is just something-

69
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:57,320
it seems unlikely that could
happen anytime in the near

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,619
future unless North Korea just
collapses for some reason.

71
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,288
We don't have a lot of
precedence for this,

72
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:04,400
the best example for us in recent history

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,259
is the unification of West Germany

74
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,800
and East Germany in the early 90's.

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,760
In that situation
essentially East Germany was,

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,488
basically, swallowed up by West Germany

77
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:17,438
and I think that would be pretty simple.

78
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:19,876
Reason why that doesn't
seem likely to happen though

79
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,739
is because China has a strong
interest in maintaining

80
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,580
a separate country in North Korea

81
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,420
that's not just swallowed
up by South Korea.

82
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,990
And that's one of the biggest differences

83
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,070
between East Germany and West Germany

84
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,929
and North Korea and South Korea.

85
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,649
The Russians, or the Soviet
Union, no longer cared

86
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,430
whether East Germany became
part of West Germany,

87
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,358
but the Chinese still care
and they can make a big

88
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:45,078
difference in preserving North
Korea as a separate country.

89
00:03:45,078 --> 00:00:00,000
