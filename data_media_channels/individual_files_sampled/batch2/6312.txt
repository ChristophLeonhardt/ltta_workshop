Ralph Peters is a so-called security analyst for Fox News and he also writes for the New York Post because Rupert Murdoch is a warmonger and will put any lunatic on air and will print any article as long as it leads you to more war Rupert Murdoch owns both the New York Post and Fox News now Ralph Peters belongs in an insane asylum but as long as he creates more war Murdoch will take him out of that asylum and and make him a respected analyst and pay him a lot of money to do this war mongering so in case you think I'm exaggerating law I give you the exact article that Peters wrote and you can make your own decision first of all the headline in the New York Post for this article is the moral answer to North Korea threats take them out okay usual black and white idiocy of the right wing you either destroy them all or they destroy us all there is no middle ground there is no diplomacy there is no nuance why don't they just write the headline were stupid okay but anyway so this is the beginning of this brilliant piece listen this quote better a million dead North Koreans than a thousand dead Americans now first of all that's a false paradigm there is no scenario or hypothetical where okay either we're gonna lose a thousand Americans or a million North Koreans we've got to make up our mind in reality if we start a war we are likely to lose a million North Koreans and a million South Koreans and a lot of Japanese those are supposed to be our allies he never mentions them he never mentions that all those South Koreans and Japanese people are very likely to die with just conventional weapons let alone atomic weapons if we start a war with North Korea because who cares what are they human they're not Americans I don't care about them well you're gonna hear for yourself an exact quote from him but here he say in a hypothetical could also die what if Kim jong-un is not bluffing and they actually could reach Seattle let alone Hawaii or Alaska or Guam or anywhere else let alone South Korea which were supposed to care about that's our allies there it well drew we had to start the war there's nothing we could do now you sing so far he's saying Wow Jane did he say we're gonna start the war great hold on the fundamental reason our government is a quote are the fundamental reason our government exists is to protect our people and our territory everything else is a grace note look at this monster you just talked about killing a million North Koreans who are basically living in a police state right now a lot of them are in concentration camps they didn't ask for it it's their dictator that's keeping them down it's like well you know a million dead Koreans it's a grace note they're unreal men he said we should do something this is again direct quotes we should do something Pyongyang's sunday test of a hydrogen bomb of devastating power begs for decisive action must we wait until Americans die this is a usual we don't want the evidence to be in the form of a mushroom cloud that's what Condoleezza Rice said before we attacked Iraq how did that turn out for us all right with thousands of dead Americans in a war we started and didn't need to start let alone hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqi civilians but are they really human do they really count but the war mongers always say don't wait you got act first here's some more quotes to make it perfectly clear quote a preemptive strike against Kim Jong Un's nuclear and ballistic missile programs would be a terrible thing demanding a vast military effort if done properly and leaving broad destruction in its wake but that terrible option increasingly appears to be the least bad option the question is whether will delay action until it's too late to save American lives in other words go go right now don't wait for diplomacy or economic sanctions to work or have the do negotiate with the Chinese and the Russians to put pressure on the North Koreans ba-ba-ba-ba and it's the usual thing of like oh goddess is such a shame we'll have to nuke them I wish we didn't have to kill millions of innocent people but I guess it's the least bad option Celeste no no it's not the least bad option I can name you a thousand least bad options they're using nuclear weapons on innocent civilians and he's like Stalin thinking that million people sounds like a statistic doesn't sound like real people understand when we drop a nuclear bomb babies get incinerated grandmother's get burned alive you know when Isis chops off heads or burns people alive we are rightfully outraged we would burn a million innocent civilians alive with this plan and that says he's not saying that's even a bad kisser he's like oh yeah that's a million North Koreans who cares I am theoretically saving American lives with a war I'm starting which will in reality cost American lives he says we do not want war that much could not be more obvious no the whole point of this article is to say let's go to war it's obvious in the opposite direction it's this typical I don't want to name his name but hey I don't want to do this but all they made me do it the North Koreans were so bad that I had to well what could we do golly gee we had to nuke them did I say nuke them I said war was about option he said but we cannot sacrifice American lives to shield the consciousness of intellectual elites who from protected positions of immense privilege insist that all human life is precious not just our quote deplorable American lives break that down first of all who the hell said American lives are deplorable hey idiot I don't know if you know this we all live here our families are here nobody thinks our lives are deplorable do you think we think our children's lives are deplorable no we would do almost anything to protect our kids lives our families lives nobody said Americans were deplorable and that it's okay for them to die you made that up because you're lying I could keep going on and on with adjectives but a war monger who wants the war no matter what and his Windom nuke people kill a million innocent civilians without thinking twice about it and then when he talks about like oh these intellectuals who think all human life is precious okay well at least the lines are clear yes I do believe all human lives are precious if you don't that's fine I think you are an absolute monster you should have no power in this country at all now if we need to go to war this country has gone to war many many times there is an appropriate time for war such as world war 2 by the way when we were actually attacked and we did not go into World War 2 until we were attacked but for these guys no no no can't wait for an attack just in case let's kill a million innocent civilians because these intellectuals think that life is precious looks North Koreans are they really humans South Korea's our allies that we lied to said we'd protect them they're not even Americans the Japanese who cares who cares it's not me if it's not me they don't count he says warfare has been humanity's ultimate means of resolving intractable issues since the first cave dwellers went at the gang from the cave down yonder with rocks wait I thought you said you didn't want to go to war now you conclude by saying it is the ultimate means of resolving intractable issues why don't you just at least be honest about it you want the war you're looking forward to the war and you've done everything to admit that you don't care about any other but anybody else's life and you think that that makes you somehow moral that you're willing to murder babies and children and moms and dads and grandmothers and grandfathers just burn them alive imagine a hundred and eighty families being burned alive oh my god that sounds so horrible right a million people I Got News for you there's a lot more than 180 it is family after family after family burned alive incinerated and Ralph Peter says ok it's a million no dead North Koreans who cares the intellectuals will tell you that their lives matter you're goddamn right we will and we will try to protect all lives and yes of course American lives because we're Americans we don't want to be endangered it is your policies that endanger us and as long as we can prevent it we are going to try to prevent this totally unnecessarily brutal genocide old war that you and your war monger friends want to start including your financier Rupert Murdoch who is just as much of a monster as you maybe worse because he hires monsters like you to say other people's lives don't matter let's just murder them preemptively that's who you are if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
