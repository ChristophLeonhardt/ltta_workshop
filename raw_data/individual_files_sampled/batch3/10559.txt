Russia's Ministry of Defence claims its identified the missile which brought down malaysia airlines flight mh17 four years ago comparisons of registration numbers coupled with audio intercepts point to ukraine's apparent direct involvement for more on this let's speak to our correspondent - igor dona fact the ministry now igor thanks for joining us you've been across the story what conclusions have the Russian investigators arrived at well Daniel essentially what the Russian Defense Ministry have done they took the official serial numbers provided by the official investigation by the joint investigative team that they found on the debris from the site of the downing of the mh17 Boeing and the rocket which is essentially the official investigation blamed for the downing over this passenger jet and they searched for dimensions of that serial number in their own archive documents and what happened the Russian Defense Ministry apparently found the actual passport of the of that very missile the passport has all sorts of information it essentially tracks the whole lifecycle of this rocket from the point when it was manufactured and which army unit was armored was armed with that rocket and here's what they found out have a listen the manufacture date to the missile is the 24th of December 1986 it was transported by train to the military base two zero one five two today this base which still uses missiles of this type is in the Ukrainian district of La Valle and since then after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the missile never returned to the territory of Russia the passport and all other relevant documents were actually brought to the room in fact they used to be top-secret and the Russian Defense Ministry have unclassified them for the sake of the probe for the sake of the investigation they also passed on all the data on the rocket to the official investigation and they are saying they are open to everybody to any inquiries any the questions that the official investigation may have in fact even US journalists had a chance to have a look with our own eyes at these at these papers also the second part of the presentation by the Russian Defense Ministry included some footage analyzed before by the joint investigative team and the Russian Defense Ministry says basically they've shown there they're examples of how they believe that footage was tampered with and the third part was probably was also a very interesting one and they it purported to they purported to play to us a audio recording which the Russian Defense Ministry says is a conversation between a ukrainian colonel with another officer and a lot of f-bombs dropped in that recording unedited by the Russian Defense Ministry for the world for the very purpose of showing that they themselves did not tamper with the recording and well this is the key bit from it but for me what is labuda to talk to me shooting noise is Hebrew and his ability to alter gravity but Roman another already well this colonel has been identified as one of the officers who is taking taking part in what the in what Kiev authorities are calling the anti-terrorist operation in east of Ukraine now all of that is according to the Russian Defense Ministry of course now so right now all of this again has been passed on to the official investigation and the Russian Defense Ministry are saying that they are ready to take any further questions and they are ready to share more information with the investigators certainly a new interesting turn in this investigation your thanks for keeping across the story there are teas Igor's done off well to discuss this further now let's bring in security analyst and former UK Army officer Charles Shoebridge thanks for joining us Charles great to have you with us as always how do you expect the international investigation team to react to this new evidence from the defense ministry well on the face that this is very important new evidence that's been presented by the Russian defence ministry it's only just been released we're going to have to look at it in great detail and of course that's going to be the position that the joint investigation team will I'm sure take they will be keen to look at it and also be keen to be seen to be looking at this evidence very closely it's a very it's a fairly obvious piece of evidence actually the I imagine the Jade IT have been expecting to receive or at least have wanted to receive the fact that they were able to identify the missile concerned through at least partial or full serial numbers of course the next obvious step would be to trace some track worked happened with that missile from the point of its manufacture to the point of its destruction or deployment or scrapping and that's what the Russians seem to have been able to have done by filling in that missing picture also the other evidence is very very important because largely the what the joint investigation team in the Netherlands basically largely it's its conclusions on was that there was a evidence trail of an image evidence trail of a Russian buk launcher going from Russian territory into UK territory and then back again - its missile now that was provided largely by the so called investigative website ballon cat it's of course marketed by itself branded as an independent body but of course it's anybody that follows it closely as myself and many others do we'll see that it always takes a very pro US UK side no matter what field it's looking at but nonetheless that evidence it provided was important and on the face of it very compelling now today the Russian Ministry of Defence has said that it believes that that evidence was digitally manipulated now that's going to take some time to analyse their findings to establish the strengthener evidence but once again that is going to be very important evidence for the joint investigation team in the Netherlands who've taken the lead in investigating this matter for them to look at and we will of course await their findings with some interest I just want ask you about the audio recording Charles very interesting they said it featured ukrainian colonel talking to a fellow service woman saying quote we could bring down another Boeing now if you'll remember the early days and weeks after this this tragedy the Ukrainian side released their audio recordings allegedly of Russian or Russian backs of rebels in the eastern frame talking about the same thing so both sides are releasing various intercepts what did you make of him and I suppose questions are going to be asked as to why it's taken four years for the Russian side to produce this yeah that's absolutely right and they will have to come up with some answer for that but also of course if you're going to manipulate that or digitally create it in others fabricate out recording of course that also wouldn't take four years and so there might be some administrative reason for that or perhaps as the significance of it wasn't appreciated until now again verifying these audio recordings is a lot more difficult than verifying for example radar monitoring recordings and so on that can have some third party collaboration present for example air traffic control records but where it's just been produced through secret information it basically comes down to intelligence services say now of course that can also be corroborated if you like by a voiceprint analysis and so on if the person who is allegedly identified in this can come forward or at least have some voice sample analyzed but I think in this today's disclosures the far more important evidence I suspect for the JIT will be especially the serial number concerned because people are myself in a very outset have been keen to point out Ukraine and Russia have the book and missile as as well in other countries so therefore in that field operations it could have come from either country notwithstanding the other evidence concerned and also of course the key element from the point of view of so-called Russian guilt being found was this photograph trail that they linked at website produced and if that is undermined that is very important not only for this investigation but also of course for everything else that ballon cap produces I just sort of come back briefly to the documents you mentioned as you said it's a very key piece of evidence then serial number and I suppose you wonder why that wasn't again you know looked at and traced earlier to the origins of where that missile was produced where it was based russia says Ukraine will have copies of the documents similar documents as well obviously track the whereabouts of this missile do you think Kiev will produce those I think it's very unlikely that Kiev will excuse me produce evidence that implicates itself of course it could argue that during the turbulent times in around the bringing down of mh17 of course there was a fairly high intensity conflict going on in that region excuse me and it may well be that of course as I argued at the time as a possibility nothing more than that that the rebels in those areas could have actually seized a Ukrainian buk and then therefore even if it was a Ukrainian missile could have still been brought down albeit accidentally it would appear by rebels but Ukraine denied that and has consistently said it wasn't missing any of its what missiles and so therefore of course if it turns out that now this was a Ukrainian missile even if it was then subsequently alleged that the rebels actually seized this themselves that argument is now undermined by the Ukrainian authorities assertion at the time that they have not lost any buk missiles and so I think it's unlikely that they would admit this but they should still get to produce documents for all of the other buk missiles that Ukraine regiments received during their time as part of the Soviet Union I just want to touch briefly on the sort of political aspect of of this tragedy and of course has been wide political economic fallout over the last few years over this but just as Russia's Defense Ministry was giving that press conference presenting their evidence Ukraine announced that its nullifying the treaty on friendship cooperation and partnership between UK and the Russian Federation both former Soviet states do you think that's a coincidence or is it some sort of response to Moscow presenting its version of events it's its new findings again we've talked about why hasn't this emerged before and you wonder why Ukraine hasn't revoked this or even why Russia hasn't revoked it of course the practical reality is that notwithstanding that for the rest of the world it appears that these two countries the Russian Federation and Ukraine are at each other's throats of course they are still very important trading partners economically there are close links and so of course whilst on the face of it they are very antagonistic towards one another behind the scenes some level of operation has to continue and so that would probably explain that everything of course involved from the Russian side from the Ukraine itself in the UK US side is has the input of so-called information management professionals PR people so I'm sure there's been some input see through this announcement from Ukraine to try and distract attention from this but really of course the Ukrainian media if they're free to do so of course should be now asking questions well let's see the Ukrainian authorities now need CPR every button refute these allegations from Russia and let's see if they actually do that they are able to do it of course they can't produce the document trail for missile that they would say they never own but what they can do is show the document trail for all the other missiles that came and which would show that actually this missile wasn't part of that original consignment because the numbers and types of missiles that were deployed in Ukraine or were actually part of ukrainian units subsequently the ukrainian armed forces will still be known no documents will still exist ok security analyst former UK army officer charles Shoebridge thanks for your expert insight today on that latest evidence from the russian mo d you
