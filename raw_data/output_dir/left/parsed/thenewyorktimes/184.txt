“A lot of strange creatures
live in the cold depths
beneath the Antarctic
ice, but none stranger
than the giant sea spiders.
Sea spiders are often
tiny, but Antarctic species
grow to dinner-plate size.
Even stranger are
their internal organs.
Their genitals and
parts of their guts
are found in their legs.
And because their
heart is too weak
to pump hemolymph, the
equivalent of blood,
around the body,
it’s the movement
of the guts that do
most of the work.
There are many questions
about these creatures,
but one big one is how they
get oxygen into their bodies.
Fish have gills, so
do crabs and lobsters.
Water flows over them and
the gills absorb oxygen.
Worms, in the sea and
on land, absorb oxygen
through their skin.
But the sea spider
has no gills or lungs,
and its skin is an
exoskeleton, a bit
thick for absorbing oxygen.
What it does have are
hundreds of pores.
They use this
respiration chamber
to calculate how
much oxygen
the sea spiders 
were taking in.
They found that
the countless pores
in the spiders’ thick
skin acted, in effect,
like breathing holes.
The pores offer an easy
way for oxygen molecules
in the seawater to be
absorbed by the body.
To collect sea
spiders for research,
scientists had to dive
beneath the Antarctic ice.
Since the water
was so cold, diving
requires serious preparation,
but the result is worth it.”
“I was pretty petrified about
the cold and the ice ceiling
before I started
diving there, but it’s
kind of spoiled me
for anywhere else.”
“Why devote all this
effort to sea spiders?
Well, they’re kind
of irresistible.
Everything they do is weird.
And our planet’s
poles, north and south,
are warming faster than
any other places on Earth.
Learning how these
creatures live
in these extreme conditions
may help us understand 
how they will cope
with climate change to come.”
