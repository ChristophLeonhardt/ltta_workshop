1
00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:02,573
WORTH HIS WHILE OR THE NORTH

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:03,407
KOREAN'S WHILE?

3
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:04,742
LET'S GET THE READ FROM BLAKE

4
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:06,777
BURMAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

5
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:07,177
HI, BLAKE.

6
00:00:07,177 --> 00:00:08,479
>> HI, NEIL.

7
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:11,882
WHAT IS CLEAR HERE, THERE'S A

8
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:12,449
DISPARITY TODAY.

9
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,084
WE HAVE THE SOUTH KOREAN

10
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:15,519
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER BEFORE

11
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,554
THE MEETING THAT TOOK PLACE WITH

12
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:18,522
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT

13
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:21,025
MOON SAYING THERE'S A 99.9%

14
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:22,626
CHANCE THAT THIS MEETING WILL

15
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:23,327
HAPPEN JUNE 12.

16
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:26,130
THAT WAS THE READ OF THE SOUTH

17
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,497
KOREANS.

18
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:29,266
PRESIDENT TRUMP SITS DOWN, TAKES

19
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:32,202
QUESTIONS AND HE SEEMS TO

20
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,004
SUGGEST THAT MAYBE THIS MIGHT

21
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,040
NOT HAPPEN AT ALL, MAYBE IT

22
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,574
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN AFTER JUNE 12.

23
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:39,643
HE GAVE A MESSAGE THAT WE HEARD

24
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:41,412
THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, WHICH IS

25
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:42,112
THIS.

26
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:43,314
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

27
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:44,848
IN ANY EVENT, THE SECOND WEEK IN

28
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:50,154
A ROW NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

29
00:00:50,154 --> 00:00:51,922
WOULD OFFER UP SECURITY

30
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:52,323
PROTECTIONS.

31
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:53,424
HE TRIED TO MAKE THIS PITCH TO

32
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:56,393
THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR THAT A

33
00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:58,696
BETTER FUTURE COULD LIE AHEAD.

34
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:00,531
>> WE WILL GUARANTEE HIS SAFETY.

35
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:03,467
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT FROM THE

36
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:03,834
BEGINNING.

37
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,070
HE WILL BE SAFE, HE WILL BE

38
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,106
HAPPY, HIS COUNTRY WILL BE RICH.

39
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:11,408
HIS COUNTRY WILL BE HARD WORKING

40
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:12,876
AND VERY PROSPEROUS.

41
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:14,745
>> HOWEVER, NEIL, THAT RAISES

42
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:17,414
THE QUESTION WHY A DICTATOR THAT

43
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:19,683
HAS REPRESSED HIS PEOPLE FOR

44
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:21,685
YEARS AND HIS FAMILY DID SO

45
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,520
SHOULD BE OFFERED A SECURITY

46
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,854
BLANKET?

47
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:24,755
THE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH

48
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:27,925
SANDERS WAS ASKED EARLIER TODAY

49
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:30,627
IF THAT WOULD BE MORALLY RIGHT.

50
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:32,129
>> THE GOAL AND THE PURPOSE OF

51
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,231
THESE CONVERSATIONS WOULD BE TO

52
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:37,568
HAVE COMPLETE AND TOTAL

53
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:38,702
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

54
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:40,671
PENINSULA, AND THE PRESIDENT HAS

55
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:42,006
BEEN UP FRONT ABOUT THAT PART OF

56
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:43,207
THE CONVERSATION.

57
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:45,776
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE

58
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:46,110
FORWARD.

59
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,544
>> BACK TO THE TIMELINE.

60
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:49,313
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ASKED, SARAH

61
00:01:49,313 --> 00:01:53,884
SANDERS WAS ASKED IF THERE'S A

62
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:55,819
DROP DEAD DATE FOR THIS MEETING

63
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,487
TO OCCUR.

64
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:58,922
SHE WOULDN'T SAY WHEN THAT DATE

65
00:01:58,922 --> 00:01:59,723
MIGHT BE.

66
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:00,190
NEIL?

67
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,625
>> Neil: DID YOU GET A READ,

68
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,793
BLAKE, THEY'RE GETTING CYNICAL

69
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:05,329
NOW, THAT THEY'RE NOT AS

70
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,998
OPTIMISTIC AS THEY WERE, THAT

71
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:08,664
SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THAT

72
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:09,366
SECOND MEETING OF THE NORTH

73
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,667
KOREAN LEADER MEETING WITH THE

74
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:15,339
CHINESE PRESIDENT THAT SOMETHING

75
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:15,873
TRANSPIRED THINGS?

76
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,608
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID AS MUCH.

77
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:20,244
ONE OF THE BIG GRIPES SITTING

78
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:23,080
DOWN WITH PRESIDENT MOON, HE

79
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,783
FEELS THAT THE SECOND MEETING

80
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:30,487
THAT OCCURRED WITH KIM JONG-UN

81
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,089
AND PRESIDENT XI THAT THE U.S.

82
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:34,124
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT, THAT

83
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:34,858
SOMETHING HAPPENED AFTER THE

84
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,227
FACT AND WE NOW KNOW THAT THE

85
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:39,563
NORTH KOREANS PULLED IT BACK,

86
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:41,065
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP FEELS THAT

87
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:41,765
SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THAT

88
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,667
SECOND UNANNOUNCED MEETING THAT

89
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,135
MAYBE LEAVES NORTH KOREA TO SAY,

90
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:47,371
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE WANT TO WALK

91
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,505
AWAY FROM THIS.

92
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:50,307
OF COURSE, THEY ARE POINTING THE

93
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:52,009
FINGER AT JOHN BOLTON AND HIS

94
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,744
COMMENTS THAT HE MADE A COUPLE

95
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:56,447
WEEKS BACK ABOUT THE LIBYA MODEL

96
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,248
BEING THE MODEL THAT SHOULD BE

97
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:00,184
USED FOR DENUCLEARIZATION.

98
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:01,452
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO

99
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:01,785
QADDAFI.

100
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:04,788
THE PRESIDENT SAID TODAY, NEIL,

101
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:05,522
THAT THEY FEEL SOMETHING MIGHT

102
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:09,927
HAVE HAPPENED DURING THE SECOND

103
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:10,260
MEETING.

104
00:03:10,260 --> 00:00:00,000
IT ALL
