yeah hey so speaking of not knowing what's coming next Casey the president and his movements on tariffs have just been absolutely all over the place and one one I mean you just really wonder what our allies what our adversaries are thinking of this because you you literally never know what tariff is going to be implemented what tariffs going to be knocked down and we see that happening again this week right and whether you know normally these policies would be directed at our adversaries but in this case the United States has initiated a trade war with our closest allies both here in North America and in Europe citing national security the Trump administration yesterday announced massive new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico Canada and the European Union 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum the move is expected to raise the prices for American consumers on everything from canned soup to cars and while 150,000 jobs could potentially be saved experts and the US Chamber of Commerce are warning that at least two million jobs are now at risk following the announcement president Trump tweeted in all caps fair trade exclamation point a visibly frustrated Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said yesterday the tariffs are quote totally unacceptable and an affront and that it is quote inconceivable the Canada could be considered a national security threat to the US Canada announced dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs on American goods worth twelve point eight billion dollars Mexico also responded saying it would impose tariffs of equivalent measures to various products including pork bellies fruits cheeses and flat steel and the EU says it's launching legal proceedings against the u.s. at the WTO later today and will also react quote in a swift firm and a proportionate manner imposing tariffs on a list of American products that is ten pages long Joe I think the the one the one piece of this that I find concerning is that apparently the price of beer cans is likely to go up right right in time for the four right in time for the 4th of July and David Ignatius you look at what the president did yesterday what he's been doing over the past several months and his actions really could not cause more unrest among our allies more economic uncertainty Republicans of course yesterday spoke out against it it's one of the few things that really gets them speaking out Paul Ryan Kevin Brady or Nash Ben Sasse starting with the the just a statement this is dumb and I'm sure there are a lot of our allies that are thinking this but again America once again being extraordinarily unpredictable to our allies friends people who have counted on the United States being the bedrock of the international system since World War two Donald Trump loves to shake things up in this case what he's shaking up is the fundamental alliances the United States our alliances with Europe our best friends real bulwark in terms of security our alliances with Canada and Mexico Canada is the country that where we have early warning of missile threats that would strike our country this is being done by the President to try to achieve some transformation in terms of the status of manufacturing in the US our trade levels and I think it for people it's it's it's a head scratcher I think Ben Sasse said it just perfectly and what you what you quoted this is this is dumb they're saying I understand that that China is an adversary but but Europe and Canada so I think there's there's real confusion there's also gonna be significant damage from these actions as the retaliations come in people will feel it in terms of products that they buy in terms of the cost of things that are part of products that they buy and so I think we're just at the beginning of the kind of blowback from this action for the president for the White House and a public that says I don't get it yeah a lot of people don't get it and Mike Barnicle once again you've got the president of United States undermining our alliances with Canada with the EU specifically Britain France Germany looking at it so in Germany already coming to the conclusion that Russia is more predictable and more than what they can deal with more than the United States of America and while the president undermines our alliances with these democratically elected leaders you still having paying great deference to people like Putin and Kerwin and and and Duarte and other tyrants across the globe yeah Joe I mean the president has chosen as his trade policy to invoke pretty much an us against them policy as part of it and the them happened to be our friends but today's lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal Joe I mean they're basically cheerleaders for Donald J Trump on most days leader editorial Trump's steel destruction his is the first paragraph so much for Donald Trump is genius deal maker we are supposed to believe his tariffs threats or a clever negotiation strategy but on Thursday he revealed he's merely an old-fashioned protectionist his decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe Canada and Mexico will hurt the US economy his own foreign policy and perhaps Republicans in November and that concludes with this mr. Trump has been establishing a solid economic record with tax cuts and deregulation but his escalating trade war puts that at risk he aspires to be Ronald Reagan but his tariffs Ally echoes of Herbert Hoover so much for the wall street journal' support Joe well i bellow it been spin SAS talking about make america 19 what he again yeah a great statement ad John Heilemann really quickly before we go to break talk about the politics of this I mean who does he who does he think he's helping is this does he think that's gonna help him win in Pennsylvania in Wisconsin again I think he must you know look I mean the one thing that's true about this is I you know thus who are our free traders have thought that the president's stance on on these matters have been wrongheaded from the very beginning but he has been consistent the one thing that Donald Trump said from the very beginning when he got in the race in 2015 was I'm a protectionist I'm mercantilist I'm gonna slap tariffs on people and we're finally to the point now where he feels like that's what he's gonna do and he looks like he's headed in that direction obviously the after a lot of internal debate and a lot of people in the administration not happy about it you know does he believe apparently and has believed for decades now that this is the way in which you help American workers in the Rust Belt in American manufacturing sectors etc etc there's not a whole lot of economic evidence that suggests that that's correct but it's been a firm conviction of his for a very long time and he's finally gotten the point where it looks like he's gonna go down that path really has again you can we've said this before on the show you can go back to Donald Trump on the Today Show in 1988 1989 he's talking about Japan taking advantage of us and what suckers we are and speak who has been speaking like a protectionist since the 80s so anyway we've got a lot more to get to on the show we're getting an earful of just how Michael Cohen operated as Donald Trump's fixer we're gonna be playing you that audio tape with our producers fingers on the seven second delay button see it's not just for me anymore plus John Boehner sounds off on the GOP so how does he feel about being out of office well he kept repeating the word hallelujah with his Bloody Mary well within reach we're gonna be playing that for you as well thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
