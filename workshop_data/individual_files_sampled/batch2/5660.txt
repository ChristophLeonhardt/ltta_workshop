many experts have emphasized the current vetting of bread cop Cavanaugh is not a criminal trial it's a job interview this isn't a criminal trial this is a job interview for the highest court in the land and this isn't a court of law this is a job interview for one of the most powerful jobs in the country it's not about a condemnation or a criminal trial about Cavanaugh's guilt or innocence this is a job interview even if the FBI is not checking with dozens of people who know Cavanaugh just like other job interviews the references are out there and some of them are pulling their support like law school classmates who knew Cavanaugh back in the day and supported him as recently as August former classmate Mark Osler says it's not his old memories of Cavanaugh moving him the Cavanaugh's total lack of judicial temperament at last week's hearing attorney Mark Osler joins me on the beat and Mark since you cite Kavanagh as angry demeanor in your decision let's start there take a look you're asking about yet black out I don't know have you could you answer the question judge I just so you that's not happened is that your answer yeah and I'm curious if you have this whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit revenge on behalf of the Clintons mark what about that performance made you pull your public support for Kavanagh your law school classmate yeah you just played the exchange with my senator Amy Klobuchar and that is something that really struck me it's the way he treated a co-equal branch of government that in a world where we're lacking civility in a lot of places one that it needs to be maintained is is at that highest level between the branches of government in there we saw an encounter that it's far from from what we hope for did you know that side of him no I didn't frankly and I was surprised they sat and watched on my computer and more than anything I was my first emotion was was to feel sad that it was different than than what I knew before I sign the initial letter in fact I reached out to some of the people that I knew who practiced in front of that court the the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia they reported that he was fair that he was thoughtful that he hired good clerks that's part of the reason I signed the initial letter what we saw in the hearing was something that cut against those recommendations stay with me mark I also wanna bring in Kathy K and anchor for BBC News in Washington who's been covering this story Kathy what mark is describing is the mask falling to some degree with judge Cavanaugh in that dramatic hearing yeah and it's interesting we don't have other reports prior to these confirmation process of people saying that Judge Cavanaugh had a terrible temper or was rude or interrupted in that way that just hasn't come up from other reports but the other thing that we're hearing from people who had supported judge Cavanaugh and have now come out and said that they don't anymore is the combination of Thursday last Thursday's performance the interrupting and and this issue of whether he is misrepresenting his past particularly perhaps in the Fox News interview where he paints himself as having had this background at high school that was totally focused on service and sports and just academics and and then the issue of the drinking and I think that is causing some concern amongst some of his former classmates that he just isn't representing things as they really were and one of those former classmates mark here I want to ask you when I play another thing that happened later in the hearing and and so much happened that it's hard to get your arms around all that even and as days go by there was a whole period where apart from what one believes about the underlying allegations where he became and I I don't use this word lightly but he became by the standards of a nominee being vetted relatively mutinous against the process of at least the center's from one party which is actually worse than if he became just wildly mutinous he's seen both mutinous and partisan Lee so and take a look at here where he basically started refusing to answer questions from certain Democratic senators among other things I've kept such calendars Diaries for the last 38 years personally do you think that's the best thing for us to do you won't answer this is a circus the consequences will extend long past my nomination the consequences will be with us for decades you went to a pretty good law school can you think of other graduates in your class or people you knew who've gone on to big things public things who've acted that way in public no I can't and we have a number of classmates who have done wonderful things and and I can't Yale you know I'm just I'm just an old school Cornell graduate which is as viewers may imagine nothing close to Yale which is the number one law school in the country you've got classmates who've gone on to big firms government jobs summer judges we both know you're you're just to be clear saying what's on tape there you haven't seen any of the Mack like that no not in their public lives not not not close to that and certainly not in that kind of setting where it's most important to model civility caddy I mean I'm listening to mark and hearing a sadness in his voice and it must be very difficult for friends of brick having ours to see this what they see is a transformation and the comparison that I'm hearing both from Democrats and from some Republicans is with Clarence Thomas in 1991 when Clarence Thomas did get angry with the whole way and you know famously called it a high-tech lynching but he wasn't partisan in that anger he was angry at the whole Senate he wasn't directing it at one party or the other and I think that is a distinction now and to put the other side you have Republicans saying look the goal posts are being moved here initially this was about sexual assault and now it's his drinking it's whether there was whether he's representing his childhood accurately his high school years accurately and that that none of that is fair and they're doing a character they're looking at his character issues now rather than just this issue of sexual assault Katty Kay reporting from Washington Mark Osler sharing a story that you you said yourself was somewhat
