1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,926
>> Greg: THAT IS HOW YOU SAY

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:09,426
FECKLESS.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,629
AS YOU KNOW.

4
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:15,933
KIM KARDASHIAN VISITED TO TALK

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,601
PRISON REFORM.

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:21,272
AND HERE IS CNN'S CROWN PRINCE.

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,607
AND LAMENTING OUR PRESIDENCY

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,975
LACK OF SERIOUSNESS.

9
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,944
>> FORGET THE FACT THAT KIM

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,779
KARDASHIAN IS HERE IN THE WHITE

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,082
HOUSE AND WHAT PLANET THAT IS

12
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,151
RESEMBLING NORMAL.

13
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,287
SHE SHOULD NOT BE HERE TALKING

14
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,388
PRISON REFORM.

15
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,790
IT IS NICE, BUT NOT A SERIOUS

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,292
THING TO HAPPEN.

17
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,794
>> Greg: MR. SOPHISTICATED.

18
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:47,198
DOES THIS GUY EVER HAVE ANY FUN?

19
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:49,466
HE WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT FRESHLY

20
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,068
LAUNDERED PAJAMAS.

21
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:52,703
ONLY THING I COULD GET.

22
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,973
I GET IT, KIM IS NOT THE

23
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,908
IMPORTANT CELEBRITY THAT SHOWED

24
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,844
UP WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.

25
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:01,345
SHEEP'S NO JOHN LEGEND.

26
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,147
IS THAT RIGHT, JIMMY.

27
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,349
>> I WILL PUSH THE PRESIDENT TO

28
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,784
GET MORE VICTIM OFFED.

29
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:09,420
>> GIVE CNN THE SCOOP.

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,522
>> JOHN LEDGE ENLD, DON'T HOLD

31
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:12,556
YOUR BREATH.

32
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,792
>> WE MIGHT A LITTLE BIT.

33
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:17,261
AND THE FACT IS, A LOT OF

34
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,030
CELEBRITIES VISITED OBAMA.

35
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,233
JOHN LEDGE SXEND SEIN FELD AND

36
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:26,370
THAT NEVER BOTHERED JIM.

37
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,540
STEP OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN BIAS.

38
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,542
EVEN IF TRUMP DOES SOMETHING

39
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,644
GOOD OR WHAT.SHAVE DONE.

40
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:35,746
THEY ACT LIKE IT IS A HORRIBLE

41
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,948
FIRST AND IT IS AWFUL.

42
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:40,150
AND TRUMP HEARS OUT A CELEBRITY

43
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,687
OVER A CASE OF A WOMAN WHO

44
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,323
SERVED 25 YEARS FOR A LIFE

45
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:46,724
SENTENCE.

46
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,425
DON'T YOU THINK ACOSTA WOULD

47
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:50,160
FIND THAT REFRESHING?

48
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,597
IT IS NOT ABOUT THE PRISONER OR

49
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:56,233
KIM, IT IS ABOUT TRUMP.

50
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,270
IT SEEMS LIKE JIM IS TUCK IN

51
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,906
A PRISON OF HIS OWN MAKING.

52
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,974
I CRAPPED IT UP WITH A NICE

53
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:05,509
LITTLE PACKAGE AND HAND IT OVER

54
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,113
TO YOU, JESSE.

55
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:12,116
CLEARLY A PRODUCT OF BIAS.

56
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:15,686
THE WHOLE STORY CHANGES.

57
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:18,455
>> Jesse: TAKE A LAP ACOSTA, YOU

58
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,991
GOT CRUSHED.

59
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,928
IT IS I POP CHRISSY AND HE TOLD

60
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:28,065
THE LATE NIGHT SHOW I WAS TOUGH

61
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,534
ON OBAMA AS I.

62
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:30,868
TRUMP.

63
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:34,204
HE GAVE OBAMA ALL OF THESE KESZS

64
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,640
AT THE PRESS COVERAGE.

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,341
I DON'T MIND.

66
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:40,678
YOU ARE IN THE TANK FOR THE LEFT

67
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:41,946
AND OWN IT.

68
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,982
DON'T HIDE BEHIND CNN.

69
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,984
YOU ARE BIASSED AND IF YOU ARE

70
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,553
ON THE RIGHT AND HARASSING

71
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:52,623
QUESTIONS AT OBAMA I AM SURE

72
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,825
SURE PEOPLE WOULD BE LAUDING

73
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:55,125
YOU.

74
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,528
I WOULD BE DOING A HELL OF A JOB

75
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,630
AND HE HAS A STOMACH FOR THIS.

76
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,268
THEY ARE CALLING THIS WOMAN WHO

77
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,271
KIM CALL WOULD.

78
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:12,643
FIRST TIME NONVIOLENT DRUG

79
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:14,645
OFFENDER.

80
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:19,616
SHE WAS RUNNING A COCAINE RING

81
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,753
WITH SOUTH COLOMBIA DRUG LORDS.

82
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:25,923
MAYBE IT WAS TOO HARSH.

83
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:28,425
BUT SHE SOLD A DIME BAG ON THE

84
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:28,993
STREET.

85
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:32,529
THAT IS AMOUNTS TO COCAINE FOR

86
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:33,564
MANY, MANY YEARS.

87
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:37,134
THERE WAS A LOT OF DRUG DEALERS

88
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,169
THAT SOLD AND DID FAR LESS TIME

89
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,039
AND THEY GET PAROLE.

90
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,075
WHAT ABOUT ACOSTA.

91
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:48,245
AND I HAVE AN AFFILIATION IN THE

92
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:51,448
SENSE THAT HIS DAD WAS A CUB AN

93
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,050
REFUGEE AND LATIN PRIDE IN ALL

94
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,084
OF THAT.

95
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:56,653
AND HE IS UPTIGHT AND

96
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,288
INCONSISTENT AND HE IS

97
00:03:58,288 --> 00:03:59,790
DISRESPECTFUL OF PRESIDENT

98
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,124
TRUMP.

99
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:01,692
I THINK KIM KARDASHIAN GOING TO

100
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,160
THE WHITE HOUSE IS FABULOUS.

101
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,796
IF THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO TALK

102
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:10,434
ABOUT PRISON REFORM AND

103
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,335
SENTENCING REFORM.

104
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,338
>> Jesse: IT IS A BORING

105
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,606
PRODUCT.

106
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:18,642
>> Geraldo: THERE ARE SO MANY

107
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,511
CATASTROPHES COMPETING FOR

108
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,546
CENTER STAGE ON THE WORLD

109
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:22,946
PLATNORM.

110
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,148
YOU NEED SOMEONE LIKE HER TO

111
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:25,382
PUSH IT OVER.

112
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:31,588
IN AM DELIGHTED THAT PRESIDENT

113
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:35,325
TRUMP PARDONED DENISSIA.

114
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:40,931
HE HINTED THAT ROD, THE FORMER

115
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,633
GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS.

116
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,769
HE GOT 18 YEARS FOR SAYING I

117
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,404
CAN'T WAIT TO GET SOMETHING FOR

118
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:49,573
A SEAT.

119
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:53,077
AND PETER FITS GERALD WHO IS JIM

120
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:54,078
COMEY'S FRIEND.

121
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,281
HE WAS THE PROSECUTOR IN

122
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,316
ILLINOIS AND MARTHA STEWART.

123
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,785
SHE WAS IN THE CLEAR AND LIED TO

124
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:04,054
A FED AND DIDN'T KNOW YOU

125
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,024
COULDN'T TELL A MISTRUTH.

126
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,193
>> Jesse: LOBBY FOR A PARDON

127
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:10,661
JUST IN CASE.

128
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:15,632
>> Greg: AND FOR DANA AND JENNA.

129
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:19,970
>> YOU KNOW THAT PRISON REFORM

130
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,072
ACOSTA AGREED WITH THIS.

131
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,541
AND HE HAS TO TWIST IT.

132
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,411
AND BECAUSE IT IS TRUMP, HE HAS

133
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,713
TO OPPOSE AND HAVE A PROBLEM

134
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,248
WITH IT.

135
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,151
WHEN IT IS AN ISSUE THEY OPPOSE

136
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,152
IT IS ONE THING.

137
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:36,587
AND PROBABLY SUPPORTS AND MANY

138
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,755
PEOPLE DO AND YOU HAVE TO NAIL

139
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,791
JUST BECAUSE IT IS TRUMP, THAT

140
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,560
MAKE ITS SO FUNNY FOR THE

141
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,863
AUDIENCE, I THINK.

142
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,564
>> Dana: I WILL TALK ABOUT THE

143
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,600
CELEBRITY ANGLE AND I DON'T CARE

144
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,835
THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS AND I

145
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:53,971
DON'T TAKE MUCH STOCK IN THEM

146
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,573
AND IT DOESN'T PERSUADE ME AT

147
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,041
ALL.

148
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,010
ANGELINA JOLIE WHEN SHE TALKED

149
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,179
ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF CHILDREN AND

150
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:04,781
REFUGEES, THAT WAS EFFECTIVE.

151
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,916
>> Greg: YES.

152
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,251
>> Dana: AND SO IF YOU HAVE

153
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,753
A PLATFORM AND WANT TO DO GOOD,

154
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,688
THAT IS TO BE ADMIRED AND I

155
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,857
WOULD SAY ON THE PARDON FRONT.

156
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:16,093
IT WAS NOT THE PARDON I WAS

157
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:16,894
EXPECTING TODAY.

158
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:19,429
WE TALKED ABOUT MATTHEW CHARLES

159
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:22,132
WHO IS ACTUALLY BACK IN JAIL, IT

160
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,835
WAS A GOVERNMENT ERROR AND I

161
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,004
HEAR IS KICKED AROUND THAT HIS

162
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:29,473
SENTENCE WOULD BE COMMUTED AND

163
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:34,611
A PARDON POSSIBLY THIS WEEK AND

164
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:39,383
THAT IS MUCH MORE AWARDED.

165
00:06:39,383 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Greg: HE DID DO JACK JOHNSON.
