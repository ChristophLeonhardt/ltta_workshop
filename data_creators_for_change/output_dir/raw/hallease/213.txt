00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,510
hey guys so I just want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,640
quick update it's been about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week</font>

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,859
since I<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced that I was going to</font>

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,099
comb out my locks and I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you</font>

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,679
can still see them but yes I have kept

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,109
my word and am coming them out it is

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,250
just taking far longer than I expected

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,019
so he to give you an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea as you can see</font>

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,500
my hair is still here but I started in

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,949
the center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a section there's</font>

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,020
a section there's a section got a few

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">little sections here going so you know</font>

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,309
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of perspective that's how much</font>

14
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my hair I don't even know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if this is</font>

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,670
like seeable it's probably not I have

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,079
done um still got a long way to go home

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,920
as you can see i definitely recommend

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,910
starting at the center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hair</font>

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,549
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a job and there</font>

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,939
for you to go to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't want to</font>

21
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,100
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work looking a hot mess so what I</font>

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,720
do is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put my hair in a ponytail</font>

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,939
and like a bun and nav no one really

24
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,100
knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all of it I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through a</font>

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,369
major transition audition for all of you

26
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,140
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about considering starting locs</font>

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,460
purely for the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> just having them</font>

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,869
for like a year year and a half to let

29
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,900
retain length<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was strongly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,060
not doing that because combing them out

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,400
has just been a bit of a pain um I will

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,250
say this though it it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot easier</font>

33
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">to comb them out once i get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,450
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my head where I started</font>

35
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,420
interlocking because the levels<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">hairs just folded on top of each other</font>

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,560
and so like picking it out it's like it

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,350
picks out in those layers and it becomes

39
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,619
a lot more easy so if I ever do get

40
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:02,969
another set of locks which I think I

41
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,770
will you know eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you know</font>

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,270
I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that three-month give myself</font>

43
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,889
three months thing um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i do that i</font>

44
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,550
will definitely inter

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,870
from the get-go and not retwist<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the word for it you want to see</font>

47
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,950
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much hair i have already let me go</font>

48
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,170
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's crazy time be right back</font>

49
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,800
and literally just left we came back no

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video that's what I do yeah so I've</font>

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,420
been keeping the bag of my hair let me

52
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,110
tell you what uh oh what's that at least

53
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,000
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing it's just you know three</font>

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,970
years of shedding that I didn't do then

55
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,980
burn it's three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of shedding what's</font>

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,049
been really gross is that I have been

57
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,540
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> like literally comb out the</font>

58
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,690
buildup in my hair from product when I

59
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,920
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> first starting out it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty nasty</font>

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,870
just throwing that out there but um and

61
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,950
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know that section</font>

62
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,530
that's just you know this middle section

63
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,930
I got going<font color="#E5E5E5"> here of air</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

64
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,010
i'm very excited I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

65
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's as soft and thick it's nice it</font>

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,489
feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my hair can breathe a little</font>

67
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,470
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm noticing that now that I've</font>

68
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,049
combed out all the nonsense just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels</font>

69
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it retains moisture a little better</font>

70
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,440
i don't know maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,680
just being like it's different you know

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,260
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have retained a good portion of my</font>

73
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,290
length um sick here's one you know see

74
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,239
how long the walk is and put next to it

75
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'd let lose the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first couple inches but</font>

76
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,359
you know I expected to do something and

77
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,850
I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ends a lot of my ends are</font>

78
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,340
just dry out there so dry and broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

79
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,950
definitely going to cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> them off you</font>

80
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,529
know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to trim my whole head</font>

81
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,919
again and just start fresh so but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

82
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,979
so considering that I've ready to go

83
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:30,300
yeah I kept you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a good a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

84
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,240
portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of link so it's not horrible um</font>

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,440
