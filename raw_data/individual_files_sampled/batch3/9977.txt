HEATHER: WELCOME BACK, NEW PROPOSAL TO FIGHT THE NEW OPIOID CRISIS, 15 STATES YO SUE SEE THEM THERE, UNVEILING PLANS TO TAX DRUG MAKERS FOR PRESCRIPTION PAIN KILLERS, SO IS THIS THE RIGHT MOVE CRACK DOWN ON THE RAMPING USE OF OPIOIDS IN OUR COUNTRY? HERE THE WEIGH IN RADIOLOGIST DR. NICOLE SAPHIER. DESCRIBE OVERALL WHAT IS THE PLAN BEHIND THIS? THIS IS THE PLAN TO HAVE THE DRUG MAKERS PAY FOR THE DRUGS BASICALLY, A LITTLE MORE? THE OPIOID CRISIS HAS COST THE UNITED STATES OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, THAT'S ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. HOWEVER, FAR MAJORITY OF THE MONEY LOST IS DUE TO LOST JOBS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ADDICTED OR OVERDOSED ON ILLEGAL OPIOIDS. MY CONCERN IS LEVYING TAX FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING BUT EXCEPT RAISE PRICES FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEGITIMATE TAKING MEDICATION. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT, WE DO NEED TO BRING REVENUE TO HELP WITH THIS BUT IN THE SAME STAND SHOULD WE SAY WE SHOULD BE SIGNING OR TAXING ANY LEGISLATOR THAT'S OBSTRUCTION TO BORDER SECURITY BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE ALL THE ILLEGAL OPIOIDS ARE COMING FROM, YES, TAXES PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY MAY BRING IN REVENUE BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A DENT IN THE OPIOID CRISIS. HEATHER: IN PENNSYLVANIA, ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IT WOULD TAX 10% OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE FIRST SALE OF A DRUG IN THE STATE, SO WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THAT MEAN? WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS WHEN THE MEDICATION IS BEING SOLD SRRY THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IS GOING TO BE TAXED ON THAT ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A NEW PRESCRIPTION. WHAT IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY GOING TO DO? HEATHER: HOW HAY WILL MAKE UP THE COSTS? INCREASE AND TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE A TRICKLE-DOWN EFFECT. HEATHER: WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE OVERALL LOBBYING EFFORT TO IMPOSE, $100 MILLION IN LOBBYING EFFORT BY DRUG MAKERS, BETWEEN 2006 TO 2015. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BY FAR HAS THE LARGEST LOBBYING EFFORTS AND, YES, THEY'VE ALREADY RELEASED THEIR LOBBYISTS TO TRY AND TACKLE THIS AND I DO THINK A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS WASTED ON LOBBYING ESPECIALLY FOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, I DO THINK THEY ACTUALLY MAY HAVE SOME POINT BEHIND LOBBYING EFFORTS. HEATHER: WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WOULD IT BE OTHER THAN PASSING PRICE TO CONSUMERS? PHYSICIANS REALLY NEED TO BE EDUCATED. YOU HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF PHYSICIAN WHO IS ARE PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO BECOME ADDICTED AND WHAT DON'T WHAT DOES NOT, ESSENTIALLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT OVERPRESCRIBING OPIOIDS FOR PAIN THAT CAN BE MANAGED BY TYLENOL, IF THEY TAKE IT TOO LONG, THE LONGER THEY TAKE OUTSIDE THE INCREASE RISK TO BECOMING ADDICTED. PHYSICIANS NEED TO BE AWARE AND EDUCATING THE FACT THAT BY SHORTENING DURATION THEY ARE DECREEING RISK OF PEOPLE GETTING OPIOID ADDICTION. HEATHER: AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND I DISCUSSED BEFORE ALTERNATIVE TO DRUGS THAT WOULD BE SO ADDICTIVE? IN INTERVENTION RADIOLOGY, WE HAVE AMAZING TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW THAT WE ARE USING WITH PAIN CONTROL, NERVE BLOCKS, INFUSIONS OF DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS AND BY THE WAY, IVTYLENOL HAS SHOWN TO BE BETTER, THE PROBLEM IS EXPENSIVE. HEATHER: PERHAPS MAKE THE OPIOIDS MORE EXPENSE AIF ALTERNATIVES LESS EXPENSIVE SO PEOPLE CAN BE INCLINED TO USE MORE. WE NEED TO TALK TO INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY MANDATE
