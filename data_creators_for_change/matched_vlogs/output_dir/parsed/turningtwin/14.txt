that's what we've got to try and see if
we can do it like like normal lips I'm
gonna try stand up on the electric

before arm and I remember just like
rolling on every second so
let's type the second times every better
all right guys on rage and operate can
see by these wheels that are built for
our off-road guys what do you guys it
out which is very quick and you should
probably wear a helmet today yeah we
should probably be wearing a helmet
my god that's a big hint and that's me
so I'm just doing sly my sanctuary
that's the original skateboard okay now
that we've semi home to standing up I'm
gonna try to a hand pin we've decided
that we're going to do it on the grass
for safety reasons and to determine
who's gonna go festival do
around 2:00
yeah we both let me get past the tree
hey he got past the tree though she's
gone around the tree it would have been
something
by guys like me challenge we're gonna do
chest bounce
I mean taken definitely won that round
but I'm ready to fight back
ok so now we're going to try with our
legs together see if that works
big word
turn
concentrate concise and only when you go
here so I mean look at this
that concentration though it was a lot
it does takes a little concentration my
arms like flinching cuz the board and
how you turn
okay taking just one the elbow bounced
around I'm claiming an Olympian yes I'm
going to stop those people yeah it's
kind of like my life that was our
favorite yeah because that one you could
balance if you were about to go over you
could easily move back I don't know it
just comes like steering yeah like you
can steer is actually really far yes so
taking basically one hands and chest and
uh balance today so that means team
basically won the whole challenge so you
