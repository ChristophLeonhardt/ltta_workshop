Well, if Antioch
College has its way,
campus smooching will involve
so many questions and answers.
You might want to bring
your lawyer along.
These are the rules.
I don’t think the sexual
offense policy was anti-sex.
I loved sex then,
and I love sex now.
I had a problem — 
and I still have a problem —
with people feeling
like they can’t
slow down enough
to figure out what
the other person
is really feeling.
#MeToo.
MeToo.
The person of the year
is the #MeToo movement.
The same conflicts that
we had in our discussions
in the early 1990s at Antioch
College are happening now.
What is misconduct,
and what isn’t?
Is it the job of men
to now decide when
women are capable of consent?
We did this 25 years ago.
It’s just crazy to me
that it’s still an issue.
As it reaches the bedroom, as it
reaches this male-female coming
together, women are saying what?
Women are saying, “Us too.”
I see consent as a human issue.
If, from the point
you meet somebody,
you’re not seeing them as
a person, that’s a problem.
The difference is
not necessarily
that we are where we want to be.
The difference is that people
are talking about it now.
That’s the difference.
Consent.
That’s a tough one, isn’t it?
Nonverbal, it’s very tricky.
I think you have to be verbal.
All of these questions that we
were talking about at Antioch
in our so-called bubble
have now become dinner table
conversation.
We’re going to talk to you all
about sexual health and S.O.P.P.
This is a vagina.
And this is the butt.
This is actually simple.
If someone doesn’t want
to have sex with you,
don’t have sex with them.
So in 1991, a group
of women at Antioch
began a campaign to promote a
culture free of sexual violence
at Antioch.
This was Antioch in the '90s.
Antioch has a history of
being a fairly radical place.
It was really pretty
wild, very small.
When I came that
fall, I look out,
and there are two people dancing
around in the rain naked.
I’m like, where in the world did
my mother leave me that people
dance around in the rain naked?
The campus foments this
energy to make changes
to better our society.
And it always has had a
safe feeling about it.
Antioch has this openness.
And I like that.
And then there was
finding out that two women
had been raped on the campus.
So we decided that we should
talk to other women on campus.
And so we called a meeting.
And I said, I’m going
to that meeting.
I need to get a napkin.
O.K.
There were so many women
in the room that night.
There weren’t enough
chairs for them.
We had hit a nerve.
At Antioch, we were
playing with empowerment.
We were pretending
we were empowered.
I know I was.
So when we discovered that
there was a rape on campus,
we played with saying
exactly what we wanted,
which was  that.
We decided to draft
a list of demands.
We wanted people to understand
that breaking someone’s consent
in even the smallest of ways
was connected to the most
violent of assaults.
But it didn’t take long
for us to figure out
that we had to define consent.
How do you have sex
at Antioch College?
Very carefully.
You have to ask permission
before each and every action,
from smooching to 
you-know-what.
At the time, that was
considered outrageous
because it de-sexes
the whole thing.
Political correctness and
campus feminism run amok.
Sex is supposed to be mysterious
and a little dangerous.
So we’ve got radio
and TV spots —
The Sanford Florida Herald,
The Daily Times Call
in Longmont, Colorado.
This went viral before going
viral was even a thing.
Is how students get from
first base to second base
really any of Antioch
College’s business?
This idea of women as asexual,
things like the Antioch rules.
You now have to regulate
romance in the interest
of protecting women.
A lot of erectile difficulties.
We were the laughing stock.
I was standing in our bookstore
when someone from "S.N.L." called.
And they said, “Can we get
one of your football jerseys?”
And we laughed.
“We don’t have a football team.”
The joke was on us.
Live from Antioch
College in Antioch, Ohio,
it’s time to play
“Is It Date Rape?"
The idea that we were involved
in some anti-sex crusade
was so laughable.
May I kiss you on the mouth?
Yes.
I would like you to
kiss me on the mouth.
Antioch was a very
sex-positive culture.
...sexual intimacy by
feeling your buttocks?
Yes, you have my permission.
We wanted to have as much of a
sexual cornucopia as we wanted,
but we wanted to be
asked if we wanted it.
That’s it.
I was devastated.
Frustration, anger,
disappointment.
I was so embarrassed,
and I felt humiliated.
I ended up leaving school.
I quit.
I think that "S.N.L." talked
about S.O.P.P. in 1995,
which is when I was born.
‘93? Then I wasn’t born.
I wasn’t even a twinkle
in my mother’s eye
yet when they did that.
Going in to Antioch, I
had only heard about S.O.P.P.
through that skit.
All I could think of was
I’m going to the school that
got made fun of.
Can anybody think
of a time where
there was a movie that actually
showed affirmative consent?
Anybody see “Frozen"?
At the end of “Frozen,"
when that dude is like,
“Can I kiss you?”
May I?
We me?
I mean, may we?
Wait, what?
We may.
This is the first
time in a Disney movie
that somebody asked for consent.
“The S.O.P.P. is Antioch’s
formal attempt
at ending sexual
violence while fostering
a campus culture of positive
consensual sexuality.”
...give you all a little
bit more information.
It seems like it’s
such a big part
of the way of thinking now.
“Sex is like cooking."
"I want to cook for you."
"But if I cook for
you now, will you
expect me to cook for you later?"
"And if I do cook for
you later, will you
expect me to cook
for you all the time?”
“I want to cook for you.
But what if you think
my cooking sucks?”
“I want to cook for you,
but can we talk about it
before I start cooking?”
I feel like it’s good that
this was here to give people
permission to talk about this.
In high school, relationships,
it’s like a game.
You have to swoon a
girl and make her —
you have to — it feels like
there’s a lot of gray area
when it comes to
one’s first experience
with sexual intimacy.
But with this,
it’s so much easier
to become intimate
with someone if you
know exactly where
they’re at and where
you’re at yourself
using verbal consent.
It’s just more of
a worldwide thing
that we can talk
about things now.
And with social media,
that has just exploded.
Somebody can say, hey,
that happened to me,
and I didn’t realize
that’s what that was.
I didn’t realize that that
counts as sexual assault.
Does it mean that women
are empowered enough now
to say, not anymore?
Well, this is just the start.
And I’ve been saying
from the beginning
that it’s not just a moment.
It’s a movement.
Me, too.
Me, too.
I have been sexually harassed.
We have to support each
other, and stand together,
and say that’s it.
We’re done.
No more.
Do I feel vindicated, like you
all finally caught up to us?
No.
I’m glad.
At the core of this
whole conversation
is a question of, what
does it mean to be heard?
And how is a person supposed
to get themselves heard?
When you are bare with
somebody else alone,
and this is the most
intimate side of you,
and you ask somebody
if they’re O.K.,
I think that that is incredible.
It shouldn’t feel like
a novel idea, but it is.
