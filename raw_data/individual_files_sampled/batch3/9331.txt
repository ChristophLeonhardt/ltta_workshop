Greg: DURING A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH IN TEXAS SATURDAY, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG SAID AMERICA IS FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF DISHONESTY THAT IS WORSE THAN TERROR. THE GREATEST THAT TO AMERICAN DEMOCRACY ISN'T COMMUNISM OR JIHAD IS HIM OR ANY OTHER POWER. IT'S OUR OWN WILLINGNESS TO TOLERATE DISHONESTY IN SERVICE OF PARTY AND IN PURSUIT OF POWER OF PARTY AND IN PURSUIT OF POWE POWER. Greg: MY MIC FELL OFF. BLOOMBERG THINKS WORDS FROM TRUMP ARE DEADLIER THAN DEEDS FROM A TERRORIST WHICH LEADS ONE TO ASK WHEN BLOOMBERG WAS MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS NUMBER ONE CONCERN WAS? DO YOU THINK HE WOKE UP EVERY MORNING AND THOUGHT I HOPE SOMEONE IS NOT LYING ON THEIR TAX RETURNS? INSTEAD HE WAS FOCUSED ON TERRORISM. NUMBER ONE THREAT TO NEW YORK CITY AND AMERICA WAS AND STILL IS TERRORISM. NOT WHETHER TRUMP EXAGGERATES ABOUT MEXICO PAYING FOR THE WALL. FOR BLOOMBERG TO EXPRESS HIS OWN GRAPES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR SMOKING OR GUN CONTROL, FIRST HE HAD TO KEEP THE CITY SAFE SO HE COULD HAVE THE LUXURY OF GRIPING COULD HAVE THE LUXURY OF GRIPIN GRIPING. NOW IN A SPEECH WHEN HE REORDERS OUR CONCERNS JUST TO JAB DONALD TRUMP COME HE IS COMMITTING THE VERY SIN. HE IS FALSIFYING FACTS. THE ONLY 11 CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT PARTISANSHIP BEING WORSE THAN COMMUNISM IS TO DIMINISH THE PILES OF BODIES CAUSED BY BOTH. ALL OF THIS COULD BE DUE TO ONE TRUTH. RIGHT NOW TRUMP MAY MAKE HISTORY WITH THE KOREAS AND BLOOMIE IS WHINING ABOUT FAKE NEWS AT A COLLEGE. THAT'S GOT TO HURT. JESSE, DO YOU THINK THIS WAS SOME KIND OF HYPERBOLE YOU DO IN A SPEECH? HE CAN'T REALLY MEAN THAT THIS IS WORSE THAN TERROR OR COMMUNISM. Jesse: NOW, A LIE DIDN'T FLY INTO A BUILDING AND KILLED 3,000 PEOPLE. I AM AVAILABLE TO DO COMMENCEMENT IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED. I WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THE CASTLE. Greg: IT WAS A NICE OUTFIT. THEY LOOK AT WAITERS IN MEDIEVAL RESTAURANTS. Jesse: MEDIEVAL TIMES. HAVE YOU BEEN THERE RECENTLY? Greg: I.E. THERE EVERY NIGHT. Jesse: HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN A POLITICIAN IS LYING? HIS LIPS ARE MOVING. EVERY POLITICIAN LIES. I WOULD RATHER HAVE A POLITICIAN LIE ABOUT SEX OR CROWD SIZE AND ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP YOUR HEALTH CARE OR TERRORISM FACTS. THERE IS WHITE LIES AND THEN THERE'S WHOPPERS. THIS WAS CLEARLY A SHOT AT TRUMP THIS WAS CLEARLY A SHOT AT TRUM TRUMP. I THINK THE FAKE NEWS PUTS OUT MAY BE THE SAME AMOUNT OF JOKES AS PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES, IF NOT MORE. I HAVE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WORDS HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO RECITE THEM. THAT'S FINE. AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T THINK TRUMP IS A LIAR. I THINK HE HAS A POSTER. CLEANS REAL ESTATE TYCOON. BIGGEST, BEST, MOST EXPENSIVE. A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDER THOSE OPINIONS LIES. THEY WILL FACT-CHECK HIS OPINIONS. HE WILL SAY I'M THE BEST LOOKING PRESIDENT THERE EVER IS AND THEN THE PINOCCHIO PEOPLE FACT-CHECKING. Greg: IT'S LIKE A CAR SALESMAN SANG A LITTLE OLD LADY JUST DROVE THIS CAR TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS AND EVERYONE IS WINKING. SHOULD BLOOMBERG APOLOGIZED TO AMERICA FOR WHAT HE JUST DID? Juan: I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE TO START WITH THE APOLOGIES. I Greg: EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. Juan: TRUMP. TRUMP SHOULD APOLOGIZE. YOU SAID THIS IS SHOCKING. YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. I THINK BACK TO LEON PANETTA AND JOHN BRENNAN. PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO US AS A NATION, THIS KIND OF DIVIDE BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT. WE CAN'T DECIDE ANYTHING. EVERYTHING IS A HUGE ARGUMENT. LAST WEEK I WROTE A COLUMN AND SAID WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WENT ON IN TERMS OF THE DECISION TO PULL THE UNITED STATES AWAY FROM THE IRAN DEAL, THE PRESIDENT WITH HIS BOASTFULNESS, I THINK IT'S PERSUASIVE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE IRAN DEAL HAS BEEN VIOLATED. IT WAS A WEAK, TERRIBLE DEAL. YET THE FACT IS THE DEAL WAS NEVER VIOLATED BUT THE FACT IS PEOPLE SAY THIS WAS KEEPING IRAN FROM HAVING NUKES. NOW SUDDENLY THEY SAY WELL MAYBE IT WAS A BAD DEAL. MAYBE IT'S A PARTISAN FIGHT. MAYBE HE DOESN'T LIKE JOHN KERRY. WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE TRUTH. WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANYTHING DONE. Greg: NOW THAT JUAN HAS DEFLECTED, KIMBERLY HOW ABOUT A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TOPIC? BLOOMBERG IS MAD HE DIDN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT. Kimberly: HE IS MAD THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HONORED HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND CHECKING OFF WINDS. ANYONE WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE HAPPY WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS THESE. THAT THE ECONOMY IS DOING BETTER. EVERYONE SHOULD BE HAPPY THERE'S MORE JOBS IN AMERICA AND THAT MINORITIES ARE FEELING BETTER ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY. SO MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AS IT RELATES TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY, HE HAS COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY CHANGE THE DYNAMIC. THIS IS A NEW STYLE OF POLITICS AND ENGAGING TO CREATE EFFECTIVE RESULTS. WHY NOT? IF YOU KEEP DOING THE SAME THING AND YOU END UP WITH THE END RESULT, WHY NOT TRY A DIFFERENT WAY OR A DIFFERENT PATH? ALSO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND TWITTER TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE SO THERE IS TRANSPARENCY THERE VERSUS SOMEONE REGURGITATING, GOING THROUGH IT AND PUTTING SOMETHING OUT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DOWNSIDE TO THAT BECAUSE EVERY PERSON CAN DETERMINE WHAT YOU THINK OF IT VERSUS SOMEONE TELLING YOU WHAT TO THINK. Juan: THERE'S A TREMENDOUS DOWNSIDE TO CONSTANT LYING FROM THE MAN WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT, THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE CAN'T TRUST HIM. Greg: WE ARE NEVER GOING TO SOLVE THIS. Dana: I THINK EVERY COMMENCEMENT SPEECH WOULD BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IF IT MADE NO NEWS. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE STUDENTS COME UP FOR THEM TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD, TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GETTING THROUGH COLLEGE. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO GO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THE WORLD, AND WORRYING ABOUT FAKE NEWS IS NOT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. Greg: I WANT TO DO A COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS FOR AN
