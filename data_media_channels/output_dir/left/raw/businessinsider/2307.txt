welcome back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another edition of you</font>

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,830
ask we answer where we take questions

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,779
you asked us on the web and answer them

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,150
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video segment the first one</font>

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,670
today is has google jumped a shark it

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,290
wasn't long ago everyone loved and

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,920
praised every<font color="#E5E5E5"> move no google has not</font>

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">jump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the shark what's happened is that</font>

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google has gotten much bigger and you</font>

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,930
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before was the little guy everyone</font>

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,060
was rooting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google because they had</font>

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,740
a fresh<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on everything they had a</font>

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">very simple user interface whereas</font>

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,269
everyone else had a lot of clutter and

15
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,800
now they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what's called</font>

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,230
feature creep where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have kind of an</font>

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,760
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everything you know it started</font>

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,430
with gmail and google calendar which are

19
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,469
pretty successful and then it got a

20
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,329
little hairy stuff like google checkout

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,280
which still hasn't really turned out

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,289
that well an android which seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

23
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,629
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we'll see in a couple</font>

24
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,090
years what happens there and stuff like

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google Buzz which came out last week or</font>

26
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the week before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's</font>

27
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,420
basically a clone of a failed service

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,879
called friendfeed but it had the

29
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,390
advantage of being plugged<font color="#E5E5E5"> into gmail so</font>

30
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,769
you know we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think google</font>

31
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,420
has jumped<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shark they still do a lot</font>

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things very well they are being</font>

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,680
highly<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptive at least potentially</font>

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,189
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft in many ways an apple in</font>

35
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,979
some ways and you know they still do

36
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,509
good stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still making a</font>

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,799
ton of money and as long as they

38
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,020
continue to do that they can do whatever

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,909
they want some stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying and</font>

40
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,409
selling energy I don't know why they're

41
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,210
necessarily getting into that but and

42
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,159
especially the broadband thing that's a

43
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">little ridiculous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is going to</font>

44
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,329
invest a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money into a trial for</font>

45
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,790
broadband but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this isn't this</font>

46
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,619
isn't necessarily Google trying to get

47
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,479
its feet into every market and become an

48
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,729
Internet service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider here it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

49
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,560
kind of experimenting with all the cash

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,259
it has and trying to pressure real ISPs

51
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,990
like AT&T and Comcast into getting their

52
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,200
act together a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little quicker so</font>

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,399
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think Google has</font>

54
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:54,930
jumped<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shark it seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like they're</font>

55
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,600
actually doing a decent job being

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,670
focused and they have the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

57
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,049
in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different places so they're</font>

58
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that if they start to flail a</font>

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,119
little bit and do more you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

60
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,220
some crazy stuff maybe I'll change my

61
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,889
mind but for

62
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,170
I think they're in good shape next

63
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,000
question with the introduction of the

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,310
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft mobile soft work and palm</font>

65
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,959
survive it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

67
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,610
next two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the smartphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> market</font>

68
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,709
there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> room for two or three</font>

69
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,340
winners among them could be research in

70
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,500
motion which makes the blackberry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple</font>

71
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,930
which makes the iphone google android

72
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,860
maybe Microsoft maybe palm palm came out

73
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,180
at CES 2009 with the fresh new webos and

74
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,209
the pre and tech geeks loved it but so

75
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,120
far consumers have not really adopted it

76
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,470
and that leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to the next question</font>

77
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,330
why does everyone think palm is in

78
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,670
trouble why do they have to beat<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font>

79
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,580
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android and sales to win well if you</font>

80
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,890
look at their macro sales that's a big

81
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of their micro sales and it's</font>

82
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,360
very important for on an individual

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,370
customer basis for pollen to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

84
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,190
win a purchase decision between Apple or

85
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,739
Google if someone is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep</font>

86
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,000
if people are going to keep buying

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
iphones it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter how nice palm</font>

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,530
platform is it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to win</font>

89
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,810
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of factors in</font>

90
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,910
here and how much developers are going

91
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,970
to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invest in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paul maps but</font>

92
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,829
consumers you know that's at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

93
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,390
the day that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what matters is for</font>

94
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,920
pollen to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to take market share</font>

95
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cell phones profitably and so far</font>

96
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,090
they have not been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do either of</font>

97
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,730
those things next question any idea when

98
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yahoo will get its first payment from</font>

99
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,190
Microsoft I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

100
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,170
explicit about this but from Yahoo's

101
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,329
last communication it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

102
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to try to get things set up with</font>

103
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,329
their microsoft search deal by the end

104
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,549
of this year at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in the US so I</font>

105
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,260
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some money could change</font>

106
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,650
hands this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year it you know if not next</font>

107
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,720
year but it doesn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the whole</font>

108
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,250
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be fully integrated</font>

109
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,280
worldwide at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> until 2012 so still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

110
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,709
ways off for that us probably by the end

111
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,850
of this year they said they might

112
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,859
transition some advertisers over next

113
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">year depending on how things line up</font>

114
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,810
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas holidays and what</font>

115
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,880
does the ad network landscape look like

116
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,500
in six to<font color="#CCCCCC"> twelve months is the next</font>

117
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,370
question ad networks we've seen our real

118
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,470
business they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> away there</font>

119
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a ton of</font>

120
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,150
vc investment in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ad</font>

121
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,759
networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last several years</font>

122
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,080
obviously the winners<font color="#CCCCCC"> and losers will</font>

123
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,699
come out there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

124
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,949
consolidation big<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies will</font>

125
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,499
continue to you know snap up smaller

126
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,949
companies or steal business from them so

127
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,870
definitely expect to see both big

128
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,849
overarching ad networks with a lot of

129
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:43,099
reach and also some specialized vertical

130
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,469
ad networks where they specialize in you

131
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,479
know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like travel or business</font>

132
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,849
and or something like federated media

133
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:51,680
which were<font color="#CCCCCC"> partner with which kind of</font>

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,529
specializes in social media or what they

135
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,379
say conversation that kind of stuff will

136
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,629
continue to exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may see some deals</font>

137
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:02,509
like AOL may get rid of adcom but in

138
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">general you know ad networks are not</font>

139
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,569
going away<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real business</font>

140
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,310
mobile ad networks are going to be

141
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,110
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google of course</font>

142
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,169
has snapped one up recently AdMob apple

143
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,689
also bought one it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very small</font>

144
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,639
market but<font color="#CCCCCC"> its projected to grow a lot</font>

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,839
so we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens there</font>

146
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a buyer there maybe</font>

147
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:24,770
yahoo and the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is how did</font>

148
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,229
porn<font color="#CCCCCC"> app slip into the App Store only to</font>

149
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,689
be taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> down by Apple well there</font>

150
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,789
weren't any actual porn apps in the App

151
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,589
Store there were no you know nothing

152
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,839
hardcore but there were a lot of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

153
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,050
wacky silly stuff like jiggly apps and

00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,370
made the decision to get rid of
