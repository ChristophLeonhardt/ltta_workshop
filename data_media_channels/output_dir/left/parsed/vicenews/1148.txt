the opioid crisis has become a national
emergency overdose is now the leading
cause of death for Americans under 50
worse than car crashes or gun violence
but the epidemic is more than just
numbers and to understand it you have to
go to the communities that it's tearing
apart
I come out here because of the children
and the animals don't want them to get
poked 139 I got those the most ever got
and one day and there's another one I
see as you started sometimes you find
them in socks sometimes you find them in
cigarette packs on them in the walls in
the trees they die in here too
but now I'm used to it
I didn't even know this place was called
McPherson library is needle park
if you're not adding skills as a
librarian especially because you're
working with the public you're not
fulfilling your role I was very adamant
about getting the narcan training when
we had an overdose in the building right
by our public restroom there's something
extremely horrifying and upsetting about
watching somebody slowly die and you
can't do anything when arcane can come
in a nasal spray or this which turns
into a nasal mist as well so this little
thing saves lies
freshman year college playing football I
had a awesome year and the game before
the playoffs but tore my knee I just had
a doctor I wanted to give me all
these pills I kept going back to the
dude he was giving me you know what I
was 55 czar working right I need
something stronger so he gives me 7.5
and some go audit about two weeks ago
and one of the kids one of the regulars
who come in after school ran in and said
someone fell outside and I kind of knew
what that meant I ran out he was turning
blue he was seizing up so we gave him a
dose luckily as we were waiting for the
ambulance a group of police officers
were walking through the park
so we waved them down the officers gave
the gentleman two more doses in our can
we were trained in March and is a narc
and six individuals now I'd be dead if
it wasn't for more kids when I relapsed
I owe DS like the third time I got high
and I almost didn't make it they hit me
with no I can't four times and finally
the fourth time I woke up
oh well it like this this is terrible
my little brother girl one of the
reasons I chose this branch is due to
personal history both of my parents have
are in recovery for over 20 years now
they use heroin they have substance use
disorder and they both were able to get
clean it took a lot of support and time
the NMR of darling no one really gets
clean in 30 days if you talk to anybody
who is in recovery
so until we radically change the way we
treat addiction in this country this
community unfortunately will not strive
forward
you
