STOP DROP AND THEN REGAIN POWER. AND THAT'S THE ANGLE. JOINING US NOW REACTION FROM BOSTON, JEFF BEATTY, RETIRED DELTA FORCE OFFICER WHO ALSO WORKED AS A COUNTERTERROR OFFICIAL AT THE CIA. AND I DON'T IDAHO, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE MIKE BAKER AND HERE IN WASHINGTON, RISIBLE, FORMER OBAMA DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL AND CURRENT SENIOR FELLOW AT THE NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION. GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU. MIKE, I BELIEVE YOU TRAINED WITH GINA. YOU CAN GIVE US A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO HER AND HER EXPERIENCE. WE DEMONSTRATED HOW DUPLICITOUS THE DEMOCRATS ARE. THEY SUPPORTED BRENNAN AND NOW SUDDENLY GINA HASPEL IS A PROBLEM. BUT GINA HASPEL, HER WORK ETHIC, HER EXPERIENCE, WHO SHE IS AS A PERSON, YOU KNOW THIS WELL. YEAH, WE WERE IN TRAINING AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO, THE BEGINNING OF OUR RESPECTIVE CAREERS. SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS EXCELLED WHERE YOU COULD ARGUE MINE WAS SOMEWHAT MEDIOCRE. LOOK, EITHER WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING IS TAKING THIS MONOLOGUE, THE ANGLE, AND PUTTING ON A CONTINUOUS LOOP BECAUSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THEY ARE ABLE TO NOW DRAW A SHARP DIVIDE BETWEEN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR JOHN BRENNAN, WHO I DO HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR. WHILE EXPERIENCE OFFICER. UNLESS THEY HAVE SOME DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR A MALE DIRECTOR DESIGNATE AND A FEMALE DIRECTOR DESIGNATE, AND I CAN IMAGINE THEY DO. THEN HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY EXPLAIN THIS OTHER THAN, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THE DIFFERENCE IS TRUMP. AND I FOUND MOST INTERESTING OF THE OPEN QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED YESTERDAY IN THE OPEN SESSION OF THE HEARINGS, THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT, HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT IT? WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT IT? WHAT REALLY COUNTS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING WITH THE INTEL COMMUNITY AND THE MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHAT ARE THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS AT THAT TIME. HOW SOMEBODY FEELS ABOUT IT FRANKLY, I DON'T CARE. AND I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC REALLY CARES WHAT THAT FEELS ARE. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF A COMBAT BRIGADE OR YOUR OPERATIONAL PEOPLE AND YOUR INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE GO OUT AND BASICALLY ARE MAKING THEIR DECISIONS IN A VISUALLY ON HOW THEY MAY FEEL? Laura: THE VALUES QUESTION CAME UP A LOT. ROSA, I WANT TO GO TO YOU. EVEN PEOPLE VERY CRITICAL OF THIS PRESIDENT, PHILMONT, THE CIA ANALYST ON CNN, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS' VALUES QUESTIONS TO GINA HASPEL. HE SAID YOU THINK THIS IS MORAL WHAT WAS BEING DONE. SHE STAYED ON THE MORALITY QUESTION. THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID. DO YOU BELIEVE THE PREVIOUS INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES WERE IMMORAL? SHE SPOKE ABOUT AMERICAN VALUES AND SHE SPOKE ABOUT RULE OF LAW. I APPRECIATE WHAT SHE VOTES ON. SHE CAN VOTE HOWEVER SHE WANTS. I DON'T APPRECIATE THE COLLECTIVE AMNESIA. Laura: COLLECTIVE AMNESIA, OBVIOUSLY REFERRING, AND AGAIN THAT'S A CONSISTENT CRITIC OF THE PRESIDENT, COLLECTIVE AMNESIA ON THE PART OF DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED ENTHUSIASTICALLY FOR JOHN BRENNAN. LAURA, I THINK YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT HYPOCRISY AND SPINELESS THIS ARE BIPARTISAN VICES HERE. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN GINA HASPEL. I THINK SHE DIDN'T ANSWER A STRAIGHT QUESTION AND SHE OWES US AN ANSWER TO THE STRAIGHT QUESTION DO YOU THINK IT'S IMMORAL. SHE DODGED IT COMPLETELY. BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. DO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SOFT PEDAL THIS ISSUE? WE ARE SEEING SCRUTINY OF GINA HASPEL. I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT WHAT DILEMMA DEMOCRATS ARE FACING. THE IRONY HERE IS THE DEMOCRATS LIKE THE FACT THAT GINA HASPEL IS NOT AN IDEOLOGUE. SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL. SHE'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO'S CONVEYANCING I WANT TO ADVANCE THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA. SHE IS SINGLE FROM I JUST WANT TO ADVANCE THE AMERICAN AGENDA. DEMOCRATS LIKE THAT ABOUT HER A LOT MORE THAN THEY LIKE MANY OF TERMS POLITICAL APPOINTEES. BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT IF YOU WANT THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO EMBRACE SOMEBODY WHO SEEMS TO HAVE EMBRACED TORTURE, WHICH DEMOCRATS AREN'T Laura: SHE DIDN'T DESIGN THE PROGRAM. WELL, LAURA. I HAVE TO THROW THE CHALLENGE FLAG. Laura: JEFF IS COMING IN ON US WITH THE CHALLENGE FLAG. I'VE GOT TO THROW THAT CHALLENGE FLAG, ROSA. TORTURE IS A PROPAGANDA WORD. THAT'S A PROPAGANDA AND IT'S CHOSEN TO EVOKE AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE. IT'S CHOSEN TO CONJURE UP IMAGES OF PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE RACK OR CUTTING OFF FINGERS OR LIMBS. LET'S BE ACCURATE. LET'S NOT BE PROPAGANDA. IF YOU TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE AT GEORGETOWN TO USE PROPAGANDA TERMS, YOU'VE GOT TO I DON'T ALLOW MY STUDENTS USE LOADED THING WHICH LIKE THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOT THE RACK. IT'S NOT CUTTING PEOPLE'S FIGURES OFF OR LIMBS OFF. IT'S WATERBOARDING. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WATERBOARDING, LET'S TALK ABOUT A VERY LET'S NOT GO FOR THE SPECIFIC TO THE GENERAL. AND THE GENERAL IS GENERALLY A LOT MORE HEINOUS THAN WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. Laura: BUT JEFF, I THINK HOLD ON. I THINK WHAT ROSA IS SAYING IS THERE IS A CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE. THERE IS A U.N. CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE. HOWEVER WE SHIFTED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT MEANS AND AFTER 9/11, WE WANTED THE INFORMATION. AS YOUR FORMER COMMANDO EXTREMES, WE WANTED THE INFORMATION TO STOP THESE ATTACKS. IF ANYONE OF US WHO HAD A KID WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED AND ONE PERSON KNEW WHERE OUR CHILD WAS, WE WOULD SAY DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THAT INFORMATION. WE WOULD SAY THAT AS PARENTS, WE KNOW THAT. YES, YOU WOULD. IT'S LIKE HAVING A PET DOG AND YOU TRAIN THE DOG TO BRING THE PAPER TO YOU AND THE DOG DOES WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO, FOLLOWED YOUR INSTRUCTIONS, AND NOW YEARS LATER, YOU BEAT THE DOG WITH THE PAPER. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, IS IT LEGAL? IT WAS, AND SHE DID LEGAL PROCEDURE. IT WAS INVESTIGATED TWICE. FOUND TO BE LEGAL. Laura: SHE IS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED. TO BE CIA DIRECTOR BY ANY FAIR INDICATION OR EXAMINATION OF HER BACKGROUND. WHAT SHE FEELS AS A PERSON IS FRANKLY NOT RELEVANT TO HER JOB AS A PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE THAILAND BLACK SITE. HER FEELINGS. WHAT IS THAT MEAN, YOUR FEELINGS. IT SUCH A DEMOCRAT, LIB WAY. WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS? ROSA HAS TO GET BACK IN. MIKE, HOLD ON. ROSA FIRST. THIS IS NOT MY PROPAGANDA WORD. THERE'S REAL IRONY HERE. IT'S FUNNY TO ME HOWEVER IS TALK ABOUT THE WORLD WAR II GENERATION IS THE GREATEST GENERATION, SO AFTER WORLD WAR II WHEN WE FACED AN ABSOLUTELY EXISTENTIAL THREAT, WE PROSECUTED IN THE TOKYO TRIBUNALS TO MOWING PROSECUTOR JAPANESE SOLDIERS FOR WATERBOARDING U.S. SOLDIERS, AND WE CALLED IT TORTURE THEN. THE SAME WAY WE HAVE CALLED IT TORTURE CONSISTENTLY. THAT'S WHAT THE LAW CALLS IT. IT'S NOT WHAT I CALL IT. THERE IS A BRIEF PERIOD IN THE BUSH OF ADMINISTRATION WHEN SOME OF DICK CHENEY'S LAWYERS DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CALL IT TORTURE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. THAT WAS REPUDIATED A FEW YEARS LATER, EVEN BY THE BUSH OF ADMINISTRATION. Laura: CHENEY STILL SAYS WE SHOULD BE DOING WATERBOARDING. CHENEY WAS OUT THERE TONIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE NOT CONCERNED THAT IT WAS APPLICABLE CONCERNED THAT IT WAS APPLICABL APPLICABLE. Laura: LET ME GET TO MIKE FIRST AND THEN WE WILL GO BACK. THANK YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND RELITIGATING IT AGAIN WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS IS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED IN THIS POSITION AS GINA HASPEL'S. LOOK, WHAT THEY DID SO WELL, THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN WHEN THIS WAS FRONT BURNER TOPIC, THE FAR LEFT SEIZED THE MORAL HIGH GROUND AND SAID EVERYTHING EXCEPT TALKING TO A DETAINEE IS TORTURE. EVERYTHING. NOW, I UNDERSTAND, OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN EMOTIVE SUBJECT BUT FRANKLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THERE ARE AREAS, IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S NOT THIS WITHOUT. THERE ARE AREAS, AND THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS ENHANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES, THAT EXISTED. MAY I REMIND YOU OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, WE DID ON THIS REPEATEDLY AND CLEARLY AND ON AND VIGOROUSLY. AND NOW THAT INFORMATION PASSES TO THE GENERAL COUNSEL. THE AGENCY THAT WAS DISSEMINATED TO THE FIELD. CAN I POINT OUT ONE OF THE THING. THERE'S A WELL-WORN PATH BETWEEN LANGLEY WHERE THE CIA HEADQUARTERS IS AND CAPITOL HILL, BACK IN 2002 AND 2003 GOING TO THE TALKING TO THE GANG OF EIGHT. Laura: I MADE THAT POINT. THEY WERE BRIEFED. NANCY PELOSI LEARNED ABOUT AT THE SAME TIME GINA DID. JEFF. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HER NICE ANOTHER ASPECT OF WHAT YOU BROUGHT OUT IN THE ANGLE. TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS IS MORE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THAN IT IS ABOUT GINA HASPEL. AND EVEN INTO THE REPUBLICANS INVOLVED IN THIS, SALUTE TO SENATOR McCAIN. HE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED ME BACK MIDDAY TO RUN FOR SENATE WHICH I DID. MAYBE I SHOULD BE MANAGING FOR THAT BECAUSE I GOT MY CLOCK CLEANED HERE AGAINST JOHN KERRY. I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR HIM AND EVERYTHING THAT HE WENT THROUGH. BUT I THINK HE'S LETTING HIS ANIMUS AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP BLEED OVER INTO THIS. I MEAN, YOU KNOW HE IS A STRONG DISLIKE FOR THE PRESIDENT, AND WHEN HE SAYS DON'T COME TO MY FUNERAL, THAT'S A STRONG DISLIKE. AND I'M AFRAID THAT HE'S SO RESPECTED THAT OUT OF RESPECT TO HIM, THAN OTHER REPUBLICAN SENATORS MAY ACCEDE TO HIS WISH THAT IT DOES KNOW MANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT GET CONFIRMED. AND I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE, AND I HOPE THAT HE WILL CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT IT AND I HOPE HIS COLLEAGUES WILL RECOGNIZE SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL. IT'S LIKE IF YOU'VE GOT A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE, YOU WANT SOME BUT HE KNOWS HOW TO BEST USE THEM. NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN SHE HOW TO GET THE BEST OUT OF THE AGENCY, AND WE ARE TODAY SHE'S GOING TO RESPECT THE LAW. Laura: GUYS, WE COULD HAVE
