00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:02,810
— In Malaysia today,

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:07,430
the two women accused of killing the estranged
half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,300
appeared in court, wearing bulletproof vests.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,000
The two were seen on security cameras
at the Kuala Lumpur airport last February,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,620
attacking Kim Jong-nam with a cloth to the face.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,320
Authorities say it was covered with VX nerve agent—

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,560
a compound that the UN considers
a weapon of mass destruction.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,720
The two women say they thought
the attack was a prank—

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,200
but if convicted of the murder,
they could face the death penalty.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,820
Nothing about the bizarre case
seems to make much sense.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,460
And in rural Indonesia,

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,730
the family of one of the two
accused attackers is still struggling

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,500
to come to grips with
what’s happened to their daughter.

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,360
— Siti’s parents say she moved to
Malaysia to work as a shopkeeper,

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,500
to earn money to send back home.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,520
— Siti claims she was manipulated
into taking part in the murder.

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:00:00,000
She says she was offered $100
to participate in a TV prank video.
