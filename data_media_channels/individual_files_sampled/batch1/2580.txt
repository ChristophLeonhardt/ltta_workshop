this is the conscious investor presented by Nuveen I'm here with Morgan Simon the author of real impact and the founding partner of the Candide group over the course of your own nearly 20 year career and impact investing you've helped influence 150 billion dollars in impact investing can you tell me what got you interested in this area I've been a social activist all my life Sarah and I think like a lot of people who are interested in a number of social issues from housing to food to education it's really all intertwined and at the end of the day it has to do with how the economy is structured so I was excited about social investing as a way of really looking at how we could change the fundamental billion blocks of the economy and I started off as a college student looking at the four hundred billion that's managed across the country filing shareholder resolutions at corporations like Lockheed Martin to see about changing their practices for social good and over time got really interested in impact investing the more proactive art of saying let's make sure that we have positive social and environmental impact in every investment that we make and you actually did impact change while you were in college right absolutely and as part of a broader coalition of work that has swept the country with regards to gay rights that we convinced Lockheed to add sexual orientation to their non-discrimination clause and start giving domestic partnership benefits and I think it's a great example of that alliance between how do you make profit and value for shareholders while benefiting people that they are integral aynd because if you are a CEO and you tell 10% of your potential employees you're not welcome here well that's not good for business right so I think we see time after time that social values help to build stronger corporations and this is something that we've been hearing more about lately the disconnect between should companies just focus on making profits or should they focus more on maximizing other parts for their employees and their customers where do you fall on that I think that we all as human beings are about maximizing value at the end of the day and that value is a number of factors collectively when I think about the money that I investor that I save and I'm thinking about what I'm going to tell my grandchildren in 40 years which is I created this wealth for you so that you could have opportunities in life but I don't want to say that I hurt other people in order to create it right and I think that that is a major value that people care and care about and how we we think about supporting our families and our communities of making sure that we generate wealth in ways that we can really be proud of and well you've been in an impact investing for a long time what sorts of things have you learned or noticed or what do we need to improve on so one of the things I'm very proud of in terms of impact investing over this last decade we've proved that it's market weight rate we've proved that you can do it across asset classes right that it's really easy to implement whether you have a hundred dollars or a hundred million right there's opportunities for you I think the challenge that we have for the next decade is to make sure that the impact is real right that when you think of even the definition of the word impact right merriam-webster would say to impinge upon especially forcefully and that doesn't always sound good but it's it's up to us is imperfect human beings to figure out if that impact is going to be positive or negative and that's where I think we need to put in the work over this next decade and how do you figure that out when you're looking at impact investing where it's supposed to be positive the impact is supposed to be positive how do you look at it or when does it get misaligned so I'm also co-founder of a nonprofit called transform finance which abides by three principles and it's work to bridge finance and social justice and we really look a lot at how do you add more value than you extract right to make sure we're not just making people a little better off but focusing on fairness and that's often where we've gotten it wrong I'm kind of starting starting off with something that is positive but stopping short that's something that would really change the structure of the economy the second is that we're often making decisions from the 30th floor of a high-rise on Wall Street and not taking our orders from affected communities right to really make sure that we're benefitting people in the way that they want and not just in the way that we think the world should be and how important is diversity in that and the people that are making these investment decisions and at the tops of these companies I think diversity is critical from two perspectives one is that in any organization it just leads to better decision making when you look at global assets under management less than one percent are managed by firms owned by women or people of color or right which is really incredible and what investors are losing is diversity of perspective right of knowing that the pattern recognition that I might have is going to be different than a male investor and when you put the two of us together right then we're recovering 100% of opportunity out there and then the second is when we think about going back to how to make sure that things aren't just a little bit better but actually fair is to look at the roots of structural inequality in this country recently the Boston Globe had put out this series of articles on the average net worth between black and white families white families in Boston having over 200,000 of net worth and black families having an average of $8 right so when we look at opportunities to support job creation it's great to create jobs it's great to create higher paying jobs but if we don't start looking at the distribution of assets right and that means looking at who is going to profit when corporations do well it can't just be the same group of investors and founders right how do we make sure we're really diversifying the founder base and then supporting companies that are very thoughtful about distributing benefit across multiple people and what advice do you have for people that do want to get involved in this movement and want to make a difference but are skeptical and don't know where to start so in the book I offer four steps for a Nick free life right the idea of that it being the feeling of not knowing where your money spends the night and the first is is to really look at where you bank write that that's one of the easiest steps to make sure you're getting the exact same services and financial return but can do it in a way where you know that your money is supporting the environment or workers rights or other values that you may hold and then the second is to look at your retirement options right it may mean talking to your employer about is it possible to add a social option you know things you really can really check the box and be able to go on your way so these are easy starting places but then coupled with the fact that we need to continue to be conscious consumers of impact investment to really hold financial institutions accountable to being accountable to affected communities what do you think people get most wrong about impacted I think I think what we often do as impact investors is we focus on the what instead of the how and the what being we say well if it's microfinance or its food or it's farming or its forest related then it must be positive because those are things that are always positive right and then we forget that you have to really pay attention to the how did we do it in a way that was non extractive did we make sure that the people we say are the beneficiaries also got to be the protagonists right that we're engaging communities in design governance and ownership not just as being the consumers right or the workers and the transaction so these are some of the pieces where if we focus not just on what the industry is but how that industry is working we can really gret to greater levels of structural change you
