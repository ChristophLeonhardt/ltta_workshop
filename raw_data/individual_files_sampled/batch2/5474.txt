do these tapes help amaurosis credibility no and we may as well bring out our checkbooks right now and write checks to the Trump 2020 campaign by giving her the time that she's clearly asking for because I think if anyone has less credibility than Donald Trump it's actually probably Omarosa there's so many things to say about this White House right now there are so many credible charges that can be laid at its feet in terms of the way it's dealt with race relations and in terms of the way it's dealt with foreign policy our allies you go down a list but when when people who are probably watching the show maybe not well inclined toward the Trump administration wonder where his base of support comes from it comes from giving as much credibility to a person who has as little credibility as Omarosa no one is giving Omarosa credibility nobody's saying she's a good guy or she's honest but Ana Rosa has known the president since 2004 she worked with him on the apprentice she was inside the White House as a senior official for over a year that is the more terrifying fact about the Trump administration that she was in it for as long as she didn't let that terrifying character whether they're telling the truth or not tell that story that's a person who's actually inside and we're on the outside looking in wondering if this is just madness or strategy next to Jericho Sharon Ivanka she probably knows him better than anybody else in the White House so to that degree she is credible the fact she knows the family she knows the business she has flown on private jets with him long before this man was running for president Omarosa look every time you go to court right sometimes you got to get a drug dealer to give information on another drug dealer everyone's not gonna have a perfect background but if there's somebody who can speak about how this out of White House operates or even worse and I think this is key the fact that she was wandering in and out of the building and recording people and no one seemed to have a problem with one way or another it tells us how this organized and how sloppy this place was I find this it's just so unorganized they didn't know she was doing exactly Sean Spicer was snatching people's cell phones last spring saying we're gonna stop all these leaks apparently he never did that to him prosze so look and I also think and I know this I've had conversations with her both on off the record she's a smart woman she didn't get tapes just of her getting fired I think that's probably what she's releasing now because it helps the books I am quite confident when she's saying I'm protected she probably has people on the record saying things that they could get an illegal drug or maybe we're talking about someone who is seeking a moment of maximum publicity or giving her maximum airtime there's tons of things going on in this country right now that ought to concern is that serious people ought to be talking about but instead we're saying look I'll Moroso says X Y & Z about the president if any of those things are not credible it enhances the president's credibility among his defenders and that's going to be the concept that is actually we're going back and forth whether or not Omarosa believes the president ever used the n-word at one point she said no now she's saying possibly I would argue does it actually matter if you look at the president's history in terms of race relations despite what Republicans may say it's very bad so are we wasting time or having the wrong debate on whether or not the president ever used that word I've never cared about whether or not the president uses the n-word and I have I have said multiple times I've never been concerned if somebody's racist I'm concerned about their policies not against the law to be racist there are lots of racist people in this country I think it's not an issue of giving her too much publicity it's an issue of what does it represent about this administration that we have people like that working there that is a valuable discussion that is a discussion we can never talk too much about because it reveals how dangerous it is to be run by a bunch of incompetent TV shows I could not agree with you more the scandal of the Trump administration is that it brought the the values and in fact the personnel of the Celebrity Apprentice into the White House apparatus the scandal is that Omarosa didn't see anything the matter apparently with putting on her cell phone in in in the Situation Room that's far more damning about what the Trump administration was in its first year and I think continues to be today then whatever salacious allegations Omarosa makes now but I will say this if it turns out she doesn't have a tape with Trump using the N word the administration will use that mercilessly to say all of my critics are making these outrageous allegations against me and there nothing to them and they're all fraudulent and you're just a bunch of you know quote lib tardes who make these these crazy allegations that have no basis in fact and this is how he wins re-election okay three years down those where brett makes an excellent point you could have amorosa up there today saying he's unhinged he's unfit and unless she has actual credible evidence where he has changed somehow in the last 18 months then when she took the job Brett is exactly right she's lumped into this other look look at the liberal universe who now embraced their foe because it fit their narrative well I think the problem with that is you're preaching to the choir right choice people the idea that oh my gosh this is going to strengthen his base they already love him it doesn't matter Omarosa could come out with a proof of life that donald trump shot somebody called them the n-word and dance down the street and put it on youtube and they would say was fake news i mean it's not like this is not about changing his constituency this is about the larger discussion in this country about how organized or disorganized our government is i don't think in six months that this is going to matter that much but if you're talking about your independent voters if you're talking about people like look i don't care about this stuff I just want to organize government that's where this comes into play because people like I don't want to hear about this every day and clearly he doesn't know how to hire people he doesn't know how to fire people he doesn't know how to behave responsibly and that's what this country needs to know we can't talk about that enough look what I'm saying is if you're gonna say that that the sky is falling the sky had better fall or otherwise people are not going to take you credibly if you say the wolf is coming and the coyote only shows up people will say it's once again an exaggeration I'll never forget the code is very dangerous never forget when Hillary Clinton said you know why am I not ahead 50 50 points part of the reason is that they hit hands in honest right I mean exactly but you know part of the problem was Trump's opponents kept saying this guy is gonna be the worst thing that ever happened and if he didn't quite live up to that standard of being the absolute worst if he managed to string a coherent English sentence together some part of the country says once again this is a crazy overreaction by people suffering from transitory not just some part of the country leading business leaders continue to say ignore his tweets look at the policy forgetting the fact that the policy is damning to a huge portion of the country actually a huge portion of his base and that's ultimately what ends up happening like I said I don't think in six months because he wins this narrative if he but it doesn't matter if you're winning a narrative or people can't keep their jobs or they feel unsafe or Harley Davidson has to move or if if steel workers in western Pennsylvania feel like their jobs aren't going to be secured that ultimately it's going to be the measure of this presidency regardless of what omorosa says and the other thing is is whether you're talking about the n-word or the mysterious tape that Michael Steele is talking about or anything else with it also speaks to I've said this before we have an excellent economy right now on some levels right and this guy is still hovering in a low 40 why is that happening because of things like Omarosa because of things like Sean Spicer because people are feeling like Spicer do not change anyone's votes I do think I do I think they change they change people's votes who voted for a guy who they thought was not going to get us into this kind of nonsense they wanted a president who was just going to do business what happens is it merely convinces the president's supporters that think that the opponents of the president's will use any hammer against him including someone like Omarosa who liberals were condemning in the strongest possible terms just a just a few months ago suddenly becomes incredible yeah another credible Tribune about the about the awfulness of the president roza is complicit in that she now says he's unhinged he's unfit she didn't quit okay after Charlottesville this was a one-year anniversary of Charlottesville what did she say after nothing almost no one in the entire administration said anything she never quit she never spoke out she was fired so to Brett's point can she really be used as a credible person can't can't President Trump say look you will do anything to make your story work he could make that argument in any Democrat who uses Omarosa to attack Donald Trump as an idiot I think she's just operating in her own space which is part of the overall small which is damaging to this administration and this is a key thing when you talk about the N word and you're like well if she can't produce it it doesn't matter because like I said everyone believes he uses it so it doesn't matter if she can prove that it doesn't matter if she can demonstrate the heat said something racist snatching babies from kids it's ten times worse than saying the n-word for a lot of different people in this country so that's where I think this plays in she becomes part of the overall dyeing the overall drumbeat that there's a mess in Washington and that's not what people voted for we talked a lot about how much free airtime Donald Trump got which which boosted his credit I'll be moving into 2016 we're giving free airtime to a witness who doesn't deserve it there's so many things that we you and I will ought to be talking about at this table doesn't have clean water but I was doing that this morning clean water cost fifty five million dollars for new pipes there and eight billion dollars I think is what the president is looking for for the space for us I'm gonna make one last point eighty three percent of Republicans approve of president Trump's handling of racial issues compared to ten percent of Democrats that's a CBS poll so we can debate all day long on whether or not the president used the n-word eighty three percent of Republicans think he is a-ok
