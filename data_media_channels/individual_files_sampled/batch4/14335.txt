can I read a paragraph from from your article let's put that up on the screen here it's just incredible so this is from the national security document climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system and here's the key line u.s. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti growth energy agenda that is detrimental to US economic and energy security interests and and it goes on they're basically saying that the US will remain a global leader and it'll use technology and innovation like fracking like the oil sands but it will get fossil fuels so not only as Trump saying we're gonna do coal we're gonna do oil we're gonna new natural gas he's saying not only we're doing that because it makes money but it's what keeps us independent from Russia or open like that that is a hundred and eighty degree term that's incredible to me right so what's really interesting about that passage in the national security strategy document is it doesn't even enter the scientific debate about whether climate change is real or not it's simply accepts that climate change is going to be a part of policy one way or the other but it points out that one of the things climate change regulations do is that it restricts the kinds of energy we can use we can't use coal for electricity generation for example Obama wanted to drive the coal industry out of business Hillary Clinton said that the miners are going to have to lose their jobs so they want to take away coal and other fossil fuel resources and secondly they will themselves admit that they're willing to accept some compromise in economic growth because they believe it's necessary to save the planet so the national security strategy points out that certain kinds of advocacy for climate change regulation are willing to sacrifice our economic growth as well as the range of fuels and energy sources that is available to us that is a national security threat because if we have a weaker economy we cannot be as strong a leader on the national stage and we cannot fund our military and secondly if we don't have as many energy sources as we might need in a crisis we become dependent either on foreign sources or on one or two energy sources that are not plentiful enough such as solar energy for example not plentiful enough to address the needs of our economy so we have to start rationing which means again we are weaker as an economy and weaker probably as a military that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
