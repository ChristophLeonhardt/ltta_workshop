your DNA is an abomination white is over this article wasn't written by some Californian hipster no this article was written in the middle of Texas the heartland of freedom second amendment advocacy pretty much everything good about America oh but it was written by a college student who hasn't expressed any regret and is now being endorsed by campus and Tifa group check it out Rudy Martinez is the Texas State University student who wrote the article entitled your DNA is an abomination referring to the DNA of white people in the piece he says ontologically speaking white death will mean liberation for all but if Martinez was just referring to whiteness ontologically that is abstractly why does he use DNA in the very title of the piece does he want to destroy the postmodernist concept of whiteness as some invisible but almighty system of oppression or does he actually as his title indicates think the very DNA of whites is degenerate when I think of all the white people I've ever encountered whether they've been professors peers lovers friends police officers etc there's perhaps only a dozen I would consider decent rights Martinez Wow while his left-wing professors likely try to cloak anti white hatred with academic lingo their students seem to lack that same discretion after backlash the Texas state paper retracted Martinez's article and fired the writer the university president also called it a ver n't and contrary to the school's core values of inclusion and unity but even though the student explicitly admitted that he doesn't like white people he still had his defenders three Texas state history professors said they were deeply troubled with the president's condemnation of the article writing that rather than engaging in debate the university has essentially shunned the student when it must be emphasized the student attempted however ineffectually to challenge the forces of bigotry and racism that the president denounced at the beginning of the semester the campus anti-fascist network which is endorsed by professors like George white genocide Ciccarelli Omar who blamed the Las Vegas massacre on white entitlement and Johnny E Williams who wrote let them Fe die about white people that network also published a statement saying it stands with Martinez but when it came to the pieces title they said the title of his column your DNA is an abomination directed at people socially designed as white is inconsistent with scientific understanding race is not a biological category it is a social idea but getting science wrong and being racists are also not the same thing they're not but they are both applicable to the campus anti finet work which thinks race is a social idea and supports an anti white movement as for Texas state from a deranged future teacher smashing pro-life signs to hiring math professors who are proficient in social justice it doesn't seem like 2017 has helped the notion that even the Lone Star State can withstand the divisive and violent forces of progressivism here's to a better 2018 for campus unmasked I'm Rob Shimshon if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm you
