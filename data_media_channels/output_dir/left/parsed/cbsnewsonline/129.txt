INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE OF THE 
RUSSIAN GENERAL STAFF KNOWN AS 
THE GRU AND ENGAGED IN CYBER 
OPERATIONS TO INTERFERE IN THE 
2016 PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION. 
THERE WAS ONE UNIT THAT ENGAGED 
IN ACTIVE CYBER OPERATIONS BY 
STEALING INFORMATION. 
AND A DIFFERENT UNIT THAT WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR DISSEMINATING 
THE STOLEN INFORMATION. 
THE DEFENDANTS USED 2 
TECHNIQUES TO STILL 
INFORMATION. 
1st, THEY USED A SCHEME KNOWN 
AS SPEARFISHING WHICH MEANS 
SENDING MISLEADING EMAIL 
MESSAGES AND TRICKING THE EMAIL 
USERS INTO DISCLOSING THEIR 
PASSWORDS AND SECURITY 
INFORMATION. 
2nd, THE DEFENDANTS HACKED INTO 
COMPUTER NETWORKS, AND 
INSTALLED MALICIOUS SOFTWARE 
THAT ALLOWED THEM TO SPY ON 
USERS, AND CAPTURE KEYSTROKES, 
TAKE SCREENSHOTS, AND AXLE 
TRADE OR REMOVE DATA FROM THOSE 
COMPUTERS. 
THE DEFENDANTS' ACCESS TO 
COMPUTERS OF VOLUNTEERS AND 
EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN INCLUDING 
THE CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN STARTING 
IN MARCH 2016. 
THEY ALSO HACKED INTO THE 
COMPUTER NETWORKS OF A 
CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN 
COMMITTEE, AND A NATIONAL 
POLITICAL COMMITTEE. 
THE DEFENDANTS COVERTLY 
MONITORED THE COMPUTERS AND 
PLANTED HUNDREDS OF FILES 
CONTAINING MALICIOUS CODE AND 
STOLE EMAILS AND OTHER 
DOCUMENTS. 
THE CONSPIRATORS CREATED 
FICTITIOUS ONLINE PERSONAS 
INCLUDING D.C. LEAKS, AND 
GOOSIFER2.0, AND THEY USED THOSE
PERSONAS TO RELEASE INFORMATION,
INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF STOLEN
E-MAILS AND OTHER
GUCIFER 2.0 AND THEY USED THAT 
TO DISSEMINATE  THOUSANDS OF 
STOLEN DOCUMENTS. 
THE DEFENDANTS FALSELY CLAIMED 
THE D.C. LEAKS WAS A GROUP OF 
AMERICAN HACKERS, AND THAT 
GUCIFER 2.0  WAS A ROMANIAN 
HACKER. 
IN FACT, BOTH WERE CREATED AND 
CONTROLLED BY THE RUSSIAN
ECTLY E
PUBLIC, THE DEFENDANTS
TRANSFERRED STOLEN DOCUMENTS TO
ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT IS NOT
IDENTIFIED BY NAME IN THE
INDICTMENT, AND THEY USED THAT
ORGANIZATION AS
GRU. 
IN ADDITION TO RELEASING 
DOCUMENTS TO THE PUBLIC, THEY 
TRANSFERRED STOLEN DOCUMENTS TO 
ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT IS 
NOT IDENTIFIED BY NAME IN THE 
INDICTMENT. 
THEY USED THAT ORGANIZATION AS 
A PASS-THROUGH  TO RELEASE THE 
DOCUMENTS AND DISCUSS THE 
TIMING OF THE RELEASE IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO ENHANCE THE IMPACT 
ON THE ELECTION. 
IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL THEIR 
CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA, THE 
DEFENDANTS USED A NETWORK OF 
COMPUTERS AROUND THE WORLD AND 
THEY PAID FOR IT USING 
CRYPTOCURRENCY. 
THE CONSPIRATORS CORRESPONDED 
WITH SEVERAL AMERICANS THE 
COURSE OF THE CONSPIRACY 
THROUGH THE INTERNET. 
THERE IS NO ALLEGATION IN THIS 
INDICTMENT, THAT THE AMERICANS 
KNEW THEY WERE CORRESPONDING 
WIL
WITH RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS. 
IN A 2nd RELATED CONSPIRACY, 
RUSSIAN GRU OFFICERS HACKED A 
STATE ELECTION BOARD AND STORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT 500,000 
VOTERS. 
THEY ALSO HACKED INTO COMPUTERS 
OF A COMPANY THAT SUPPLIED 
SOFTWARE USED TO VERIFY VOTER 
REGISTRATION INFORMATION. 
THEY TARGETED STATE AND LOCAL 
OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ADMINISTERING ELECTIONS AND 
THEY SENT SPEARFISHING EMAILS 
TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN 
ADMINISTERING ELECTIONS, 
INCLUDING ATTACHING MALICIOUS 
SOFTWARE. 
THE INDICTMENT INCLUDES 11 
CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS AND A 
FORFEITURE ALLEGATION. 
COUNT ONE CHARGES 11 DEFENDANTS 
FOR CONSPIRING TO ACCESS 
COMPUTERS WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION 
AND DAMAGE TO THOSE COMPUTERS 
IN CONNECTION WITH EFFORTS TO 
INTERFERE WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. 
COUNTS 2 THROUGH 9 CHARGED 
THOSE DEFENDANTS WITH 
AGGRAVATED IDENTITY THEFT BY 
EMPLOYING THE USERNAMES AND 
PASSWORDS OF VICTIMS IN ORDER 
TO COMMIT COMPUTER FRAUD. 
COUNT 10 CHARGES THOSE 11 
DEFENDANTS WITH MONEY 
LAUNDERING, FOR TRANSFERRING 
CRYPTOCURRENCY THROUGH A WEB OF 
TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO 
PURCHASE COMPUTER SERVICE, -- 
SERVERS, REGISTER DOMAINS AND 
MAKE OTHER PAYMENTS IN 
FURTHERANCE OF THEIR HACKING 
ACTIVITIES WHILE TRYING TO 
CONCEAL THEIR CONNECTIONS TO 
RUSSIA. 
COUNTY 11 CHARGES 2 DEFENDANTS 
FOR SEPARATE CONSPIRACIES. 
TO ACCESS COMPUTERS WITHOUT 
AUTHORIZATION AND TO DAMAGE 
THOSE COMPUTERS IN CONNECTION 
WITH EFFORTS TO INFILTRATE 
COMPUTERS USED TO ADMINISTER 
ELECTIONS. 
FINALLY, THE INDICTMENT SEEKS 
THE FORFEITURE OF PROPERTY 
INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY. 
PROPERTY -- FOE FORFEIT CHU
THERE IS NO ALLEGATION IN THIS 
INDICTMENT -- INDICTMENT THAT 
ANY AMERICAN CITIZEN COMMITTED 
A CRIME. 
THERE IS NO ALLEGATION THAT THE 
CONSPIRACY CHANGED THE VOTE 
COUNT OR AFFECTED ANY ELECTION 
RESULTS. 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S 
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. 
THERE WILL BE NO COMMENTS FROM 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AT THIS 
TIME. 
THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL 
IS HERE WITH ME TODAY BECAUSE 
WE INTEND TO TRANSITION 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS 
INDICTMENT TO THE JUSTICE OF -- 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHILE WE 
WAIT FOR THE APPREHENSION. 
EDWIN CALLIHAN IS ALSO WITH ME 
AND HE HAS BEEN ASSISTING THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. 
I WANT TO CAUTION YOU. 
THE PEOPLE WHO SPECULATE ABOUT 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS USUALLY 
DO NOT KNOW ALL OF THE RELEVANT 
FACTS. 
WE DO NOT TRY CASES ON 
TELEVISION OR IN CONGRESSIONAL 
HEARINGS. 
MOST ANONYMOUS LEAKS ARE NOT 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
WHO ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTING 
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. 
WE FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW. 
WHICH MEANS WE FOLLOW 
PROCEDURES AND WE RESERVE 
JUDGMENT. 
WE COMPLETE OUR INVESTIGATIONS 
AND WE EVALUATE ALL OF THE 
RELEVANT EVIDENCE BEFORE WE 
REACH ANY CONCLUSION. 
USION.
THAT IS HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
EXPECT THEIR DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE TO OPERATE, AND THIS IS
HOW OUR DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO
THAT IS HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
EXPECT THEIR AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE AND THAT 
IS HOW HER DEPARTMENT IS GOING 
TO OPERATE. 
OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, EVERYONE 
WHO IS CHARGED WITH A CRIME IS 
PRESUMED INNOCENT UNLESS AND 
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 
IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING 
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHARGED WITH 
A CRIME ALSO ARE PRESUMED 
INNOCENT. 
INDICTMENT WAS RETURNED TODAY 
BECAUSE PROSECUTORS DETERMINED 
THE EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO 
PRESENT THESE ALLEGATIONS TO A 
FEDERAL GRAND JURY. 
OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED SOLELY ON 
THE FACTS, THE LAW, AND 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICIES. 
I BRIEFED PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS 
EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
THE PRESIDENT IS FULLY AWARE OF 
THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS TODAY. 
ON MY REMARKS, I HAVE NOT 
IDENTIFIED THE VICTIMS. 
WE CONFRONT FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE IN AMERICAN 
ELECTIONS. 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO AVOID 
THINKING POLITICALLY AS 
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. 
INSTEAD, TO THINK PATRIOTICALLY 
AS AMERICANS. 
 AMERICANS.
OUR RESPONSE MUST NOT DEPEND ON
WHICH SIDE IS
OUR RESPONSE MUST NOT DEPEND ON 
WHICH SIDE WAS VICTIMIZED. 
 ALLN
THE INTERNET ALLOWS FOREIGN 
ADVERSARIES TO ATTACK AMERICA 
IN NEW AND UNEXPECTED WAYS. 
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS ARE 
ALWAYS HARD-FOUGHT AND 
CONTENTIOUS. 
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE 
ADVERSARIES WHO SEEK TO 
EXACERBATE OUR DIVISIONS. 
AND TRY TO CONFUSE, DIVIDE AND 
CONQUER US. 
SO LONG AS WE ARE UNITED, IN 
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE VALUES IN 
THE CONSTITUTION, THEY WILL NOT 
SUCCEED. 
PARTISAN WARFARE FUELED BY 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT 
FAIRLY REFLECT THE GRACE, 
DIGNITY AND UNITY OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THE BLAME FOR ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE BELONGS ON THE 
CRIMINALS WHO COMMITTED 
ELECTION INTERFERENCE. 
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO 
HOLD THE PERPETRATORS 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD 
TO PRESERVE OUR VALUES, PROTECT 
AGAINST FUTURE INTERFERENCE, 
AND DEFEND AMERICA. 
I HAVE TIME TO TAKE A FEW 
QUESTIONS. 
>> Reporter: NUMBER 1, THE 
TIMING TODAY ON THE EVE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH PUTIN. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?  
AND JUST TODAY THE PRESIDENT 
DESCRIBED THE INVESTIGATION AS 
A WITCH HUNT. 
YOUR RESPONSE?  
>> THE TIMING AS I MENTIONED IS 
A FUNCTION OF THE COLLECTION OF 
THE FACTS, THE EVIDENCE AND THE 
LAW IN DETERMINATION THAT WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT AN 
INDICTMENT AT THIS TIME. 
AS I MENTIONED, I DID BRIEF THE 
PRESIDENT. 
WITH REGARD TO THE 
INVESTIGATION, I WILL ONLY 
COMMENT ON THE EVIDENCE. 
THE EVIDENCE IS REFLECTED IN 
OUR INDICTMENTS AND OUR 
CHARGES. 
IT REPRESENTS DETERMINATION BY 
PROSECUTORS AND AGENTS WITHOUT 
REGARD TO POLITICS AND WE 
BELIEVE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO 
JUSTIFY THE CHARGES. 
UTY ATTORNI
>> Reporter: DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, I KNOW YOU HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT IN YOUR VIEW, THE 
EVIDENCE DOESN'T SHOW VOTES 
WERE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF 
THIS HACKING, BUT YOU DID SAY A 
COMPANY USED AS A PASS-THROUGH 
COORDINATED WITH THESE 
DEFENDANTS TO COORDINATE THE 
TIMING OF THE RELEASE AND THE 
IMPACT ON THE ELECTION. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THE 
EVIDENCE SHOWS IN THAT RESPECT? 
>> I HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS 
ALLEGED IN THE INDICTMENT. 
ACCORDING TO THE ALLEGATIONS IN 
THE INDICTMENT, THE GOAL OF THE 
CONSPIRATORS WAS TO HAVE AN 
IMPACT ON THE ELECTION. 
WHAT IMPACT THEY MAY HAVE HAD 
OR THEIR MOTIVATION 
INDEPENDENTLY OF WHAT'S 
REQUIRED TO PROVE THIS OFFENSE 
IS A MATTER OF SPECULATION. 
WHAT I SAID IS THERE IS NO 
ALLEGATION IN THE INDICTMENT 
ABOUT IT. 
THAT IS NOT OUR CHARGE. 
>> Reporter: IN TERMS OF THE 
STATE ELECTION INFORMATION YOU 
SAID 500,000 VOTERS' 
INFORMATION IS COLLECTED. 
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE WHAT THE 
RUSSIANS DID WITH THAT 
INFORMATION AND IS THERE 
EVIDENCE OF ANY OTHER STATES 
BEING SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATED 
BY THE RUSSIANS?  
>> WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU ARE THE 
ALLEGATIONS INCLUDED IN THE 
INDICTMENT. 
THE FBI AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY AGENCIES ARE WORKING 
CONSTANTLY TO DEFEND AGAINST 
CYBER ATTACKS IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THIS CASE IS JUST ABOUT ONE 
PARTICULAR EFFORT THAT WAS MADE 
DURING THE 2016 ELECTION. 
THE EFFORTS OF OUR DEPARTMENT 
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY, OTHER FEDERAL 
AGENCIES,
TO
POST-DATE THIS INDICTMENT.
SO WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SHARE
ANY RELEVANT INTELLIGENCE WITH
ALL OF OUR PARTNERS.
WE'LL TAKE A LONGER TIME TO TALK
ABOUT, THIS BUT THERE IS A
CONSORTED AND ORGA
AND ALL OF THE STATE ELECTION 
BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
ARE ONGOING. 
THOSE EFFORTS PRECEDED THIS 
INDICTMENT AND THEY ARE GOING 
TO POSTDATE THIS INDICTMENT, SO 
WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SHARE 
RELEVANT INTELLIGENCE WITH ALL 
OF OUR PARTNERS. 
IT WOULD TAKE A LONGER TIME TO 
TALK ABOUT THIS BUT THERE IS A 
CONCERTED AND ORGANIZED EFFORT 
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO DETER AND 
PREVENT ANY SORT OF CYBER 
ATTACKS ON OUR ELECTIONS AND 
THAT WE HARDEN OUR ELECTION 
SYSTEMS TO PREVENT AGAINST 
INTRUSIONS. 
>> Reporter: DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU 
BRIEFED PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
ID HE INDICATE HIS SUPPORT FOR 
THIS ACTION?  
WHAT WAS HIS REACTION?  
>> I WILL LET THE PRESIDENT 
SPEAK FOR HIMSELF. 
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW WHAT WE 
HAVE UNCOVERED BECAUSE HE NEEDS 
TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS FOR 
THE COUNTRY SO HE NEEDS TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT EVANS WE HAVE 
OF FOREIGN ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> Reporter: WHO ORDERED THE 
ATTACK?  
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD
ROSENSTEIN
>> THERE YOU HEARD THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN 
ANNOUNCE INDICTMENT OF 12 
RUSSIAN NATIONALS WHO ARE 
MEMBERS OF RUSSIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE CHARGED WITH 
HACKING THE DNC AND HILLARY 
CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL 
CAMPAIGN. 
THE INDICTMENT INCLUDES 11 
CRIMINAL COUNTS. 
WE ARE GOING TO PAULA REED NOW. 
THIS COMES 5 MONTHS AFTER THE 
PREVIOUS INDICTMET WAS 
ANNOUNCED CHARGING 13 RUSSIANS 
OF MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION 
LAST FEBRUARY. 
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS BEEN
BUSY.
THEY HAVE INDICTED BEFORE THIS
OVER 20 PEOPLE AND THREE
>> Reporter: THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL HAS BEEN BUSY. 
THEY HAVE INDICTED OVER 20 
PEOPLE BEFORE THIS, AND 3 
BUSINESSES. 
WHILE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRITICAL 
OF THIS, SOME CALLING IT A 
WITCH HUNT, THERE HAS BEEN A 
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT YIELD FROM 
THIS INVESTIGATION.
