1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,500
“My name is Bradley Cooper,
and I co-wrote and directed

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,637
“A Star Is Born.”

3
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,220
So we’re at the
beginning of the movie

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,080
now where the two
characters just met,

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,750
and this scene is
really the anchor

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,220
for the rest of the film.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,080
If as a filmmaker
I don’t securely

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,670
plant the audience
in these two

9
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,310
people and their relationship,
then the rest of the movie

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,990
won’t work.

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,982
When I first went to
Hollywood and met some people

12
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,440
that were really famous, and
I remember going out with them

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:25,981
in the night.

14
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,899
And their access to stuff
is always very interesting.

15
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,190
But the other
thing that always

16
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,160
blew me away is to see
somebody like that in a pizza

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,050
place at 4:00 in the
morning with regular people,

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,070
or at a grocery store.

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,400
You’re like, oh, they
go to these places too.

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,370
I always found that
very thrilling.

21
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,860
And this, I wanted to feel
like you’re in real time,

22
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,040
almost, with these people.

23
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,040
That was the only way I could
get my head around the fact

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,930
that you would actually
believe that they’re

25
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,570
falling in love,
is that you need

26
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,130
to see these moments
sort of broken down

27
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:54,950
into three things.

28
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,710
One is the first visual
look that two people have.

29
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,110
And then there’s
the tactile moment.

30
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,840
And then it’s revealing
their souls to each other.

31
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,710
And in my life, having met
people and fallen in love,

32
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,132
it usually happens
when you feel

33
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,590
as if someone’s
seeing you in a way

34
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,060
that no one else
is seeing you.

35
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,800
And this is the scene where
she’s seeing him in a way.

36
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,459
And the movie’s showing you
him take in that knowledge.”

37
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,198
“(SINGING) Tell
me something, boy.

38
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,792
Aren’t you tired trying
to fill that void?

39
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:35,680
Or do you need more?

40
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:46,440
Ain’t it hard keeping
it so hardcore?”

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,746
“Is that me?”

42
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:50,555
“That’s you.”

43
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,134
“You just write that now?”

44
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,926
“Yeah.”

45
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,532
“It’s pretty good.”

46
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,000
“Her, from the very
beginning of the movie,

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,240
the movie knows she’s a
star before she does it.

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,250
And the movie’s almost
searching for her.

49
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,310
And with this scene, when she
stands up and starts singing,

50
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,681
the camera’s over her
shoulder looking down at him.”

51
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:20,353
“(SINGING) I’m off the deep
end, watch as I dive in.

52
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:26,820
I’ll never meet the ground.”

53
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,530
“So she’s in this
empty lot at 4:00

54
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,425
in the morning in the
outskirts of Los Angeles,

55
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:34,230
and Jackson Maine, this
very well-regarded musician,

56
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,270
is one of her fans,
almost like a boy.

57
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,635
So I really love that shot of
him just looking up at her.”

58
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:43,246
“(SINGING) — shallow now.”

59
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,620
“And what was
great about when we

60
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,551
found that location was it
functioned as almost a stage.

61
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,050
There’s all those
lights behind her,

62
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,756
as if she’s up on a huge stage
at Coachella or something

63
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,880
without even realizing it.”

64
00:02:57,780 --> 00:00:00,000
“I think you might
be a songwriter.”
