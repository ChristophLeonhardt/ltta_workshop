THEY ARE A THREAT TO THE 
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY BECAUSE OF 
CYBER ATTACKS, THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT ISSUES THESE 
INDICTMENTS AGAINST 12 
INDIVIDUALS, WHICH AS WE HAVE 
DELVED INTO IT REALIZED THIS 
WAS A WAY OF THE AMERICAN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT SAYING AND THE 
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SAYING WE 
KNOW. 
WE KNOW WHO YOUR PEOPLE ARE. 
WE KNOW WHO YOUR AGENTS ARE, 
AND HERE BY THE WAY IS THE 
INDICTMENT WHICH SHOWS JUST 
EXACTLY HOW THEY DID THIS. 
ARE THERE PEOPLE NOW INSIDE THE 
RUSSIAN GOVERNMET WHO ARE 
SAYING WE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. 
>> OH, YES, AND THE RUSSIANS 
MAY HAVE A WITCH HUNT OF THEIR 
OWN, LOOKING DEEP INTO THE 
INTELLIGENCE ESTABLISHMENT, WHO 
THE MOLES ARE, WHO MAY HAVE 
BEEN FLIPPED BY THE U.S. 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT 
CYBER EXPERTS FEEL THE RUSSIANS 
PROBABLY HIRED HACKING GROUPS 
TO WORK FOR THEM. 
AND THEY MAY HAVE LIMITED 
CONTROL OVER THEM. 
IT MAY BE THOSE CYBER 
ANARCHISTS, IF YOU LIKE WHO ARE 
FEEDING INFORMATION NOW TO THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S 
GOT TO HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN 
VERY WORRIED. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
LIZ PALMER, THANK YOU, AND 
MARGARET BRENNAN JOINS US. 
SHE IS IN NEW YORK. 
MARGARET, TALK ABOUT WHO WAS AT 
THIS EXPANDED LUNCHTIME 
MEETING, SPECIFICALLY FIONA 
HILL. 
>> YES, YOU HIGHLIGHTED HER, 
SHE IS SO REMARKABLE BECAUSE 
SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY STAFF WHO HAS BEEN NOT 
VERY PROMINENT BUT VERY WELL 
KNOWN AND IT WAS REMARKABLE 
WHEN SHE JOINED THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE SHE 
LITERALLY WROTE THE BOOK ON 
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
SHE IS ONE OF HIS BIOGRAPHERS, 
A FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 
A DUAL U.S., UK NATIONAL, SHE 
IS EXTREMELY CLEAR EYED ON 
THIS, AND HAS WRITTEN LEADING 
UP TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ELECTIONS ABOUT WHY VLADIMIR 
PUTIN WOULD WANT TO AND SEEK 
OUT MEDDLING IN THE U.S. 
ELECTIONS, IT WAS AN 
ESTABLISHED FACT AND PART OF A 
STRATEGY. 
SHE WAS SEATED AT THAT TABLE, 
ALONG WITH JOHN BOLTON, THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO 
THE PRESIDENT, SOMEONE WHO IS 
DEEPLY STEEPED, WHATEVER YOUR 
POLITICAL BELIEFS BUT HE'S 
EXPERIENCED ON ARMS CONTROL 
NEGOTIATIONS, AND EXPERIENCED 
IN NEGOTIATING WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
HE KNOWS AS DOES FIONA HILL WHO 
THEY ARE SITTING ACROSS FROM 
AND EXACTLY THE GAMES THAT ARE 
BEING PLAYED. 
FOR ALL THE CRITICISM OF HOW 
THE PRESIDENT, WHEN IT COMES TO 
DIPLOMACY, HE HAS ESTABLISHED 
NATIONAL SECURITY NAMES. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS NEW, 
BUT ACROSS FROM THEM, YOU'RE 
LOOKING AT THE SHOT NOW ON THE 
RUSSIAN SIDE OF THE ROOM AT THE 
FAR END OF THE TABLE IS A MAN 
CALLED ANATOLI THE RUSSIAN 
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED 
STATES, A VERY DELIBERATE 
CHOICE. 
THE EXPECTATION IS MANY THOUGHT 
HE WAS PUT IN D. C. TO BE A 
HARD LINER AGAINST A HILLARY 
CLINTON PRESIDENCY. 
HE IS SOMEONE WHO HAD 
NEGOTIATED. 
HE'S THERE NEXT TO SERGEY 
LAVROV, A LITTLE BIT OBSCURED 
THERE, AS SOMEONE WHO HAD 
NEGOTIATED THE NEW START DEAL. 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY 
PERHAPS EXTENDING, THAT WAS A 
REDUCTION IN BALLISTIC MISSILES 
AND NUCLEAR WARHEADS, AND THAT 
WAS A BIG WIN UNDER THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THE QUESTION NOW IS WILL THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DO SO? 
LAST I SPOKE WITH AMBASSADOR 
ANTONOV, HE COMPLAINED HE COULD 
NOT GET A MEETING IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C. THESE DAYS 
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A POLITICALLY 
TOXIC TOPIC. 
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ARE 
PUTTING A DOMESTIC FILTER ON 
THIS BECAUSE FOREIGN POLICY IS 
SO MUCH OF HOW WE ARE HEARING 
THIS NARRATIVE. 
>> QUESTION ON THAT POINT, 
FIRST OF ALL, SERGEY LAVROV, 
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER TO 
PRESIDENT PUTIN'S RITE. 
YOU TALKED TO TREY GOWDY ON 
FACE THE NATION. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESSURE 
ON THE PRESIDENT TO EITHER A, 
SAY SOMETHING TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 
ABOUT INTERFERING AND THE 
ONGOING INTERFERENCE BY THE 
RUSSIANS OR TO ACTUALLY DO 
SOMETHING, TREY GOWDY WAS STARK 
AS A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
PARTY AS TO WHAT HE THINKS THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD DO. 
>> THE CONGRESSMAN FROM SOUTH 
CAROLINA WHO HELD THAT FIERY, 
YOU KNOW, HEARING EARLIER IN 
THE WEEK WITH PETER STRZOK, 
THAT FBI AGENT WHO'S BEEN 
ACCUSED OF HAVING POLITICAL 
BIAS, WHICH IS WHY HE WAS TAKEN 
OFF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, 
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR TREY 
GOWDY AS A CONGRESSMAN, AS A 
REPUBLICAN, DRAW THE LINE THAT 
WE OFTEN HEAR THE PRESIDENT 
SORT OF MUDDY HERE, WHICH IS TO 
SAY YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THE 
MEDDLING. 
YOU CAN CALL THIS AN ASSAULT ON 
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, AND 
RECOGNIZE IT FOR WHAT IT IS, 
AND AT THE SAME TIME 
ACKNOWLEDGE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
THE VALIDITY OF HIS ELECTION. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONFLATE THE 
TWO. 
THE PRESIDENT CONFLATES THESE 
THINGS IN PART BECAUSE HE TAKES 
IT SO PERSONALLY. 
THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY A A FACT 
PATTERNESTABLISHED BY U.S. 
INTELLIGENCE, BY THE FBI, OUR 
ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. 
IT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER HE 
IS LEGITIMATE IN THIS JOB, AND 
HE CAN'T SEPARATE THE TWO 
IDEAS. 
WHEN WE BRING UP THE IDEA, WILL 
HE CONFRONT HIM ON MEDDLING, 
CAN HE TAKE HIMSELF OUT OF THAT 
EQUATION, AND IT MATTERS WHAT 
HAPPENED BEFORE I TOOK THE 
OFFICE, AND IT MATTERS WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN YOU ATTACK THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
>> CAN YOU ESTABLISH THE 
DISTINCTION THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING, 
SAYING STOP CALLING THIS A 
SUMMIT, THIS IS JUST A MEETING. 
WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
THE TWO. 
IT MAKES ME THINK OF DATING, IF 
I'M MEETING YOU FOR COFFEE, NO 
BIG DEAL, IF I'M MEETING YOU 
FOR DINNER, THIS IS POTENTIAL. 
THIS IS A BIG DEAL, RIGHT. 
>> DEPENDING ON HOW IT GOES, WE 
CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CALL IT 
LATER. 
SOME OF THAT IS A REFLECTION 
THAT MANY OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
TEAM HAVE BEEN CAUTIONING 
AGAINST TAKING THE SUMMIT 
MEETING ENCOUNTER IN THE WAY HE 
HAS. 
WHILE THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE 
HAS LOW EXPECTATIONS, HE HAS 
DRAWN EVERY CAMERA INTO THE 
WORLD AT THIS MOMENT, AND WE 
ARE FOLLOWING IT AS IF IT'S A 
SPORTING EVENT, PLAY BY PLAYS, 
THAT'S NOT HOW DIPLOMACY 
HAPPENS. 
THE AMBASSADOR WAS TRYING TO 
HELP THE PRESIDENT THERE. 
>> AND THE REASON THEY CALL 
THEM SUMMITS IS BECAUSE THEY 
HAPPEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS, 
YOU CAN'T GET HIGHER THAN THE 
PRESIDENTS OF TWO COUNTRIES. 
LEADERS TEND TO RESPOND TO 
THOSE AND NOT WHAT ACTUALLY 
HAPPENS AND THAT CREATES 
SOMETHING THEY THEN HAVE TO 
RESPOND TO, WHICH IS OF 
SOMEBODY ELSE'S MAKING. 
THEY WANT TO CONTROL IT AS MUCH 
AS POSSIBLE. 
EXPECTATIONS ARE TARGETS THEY 
HAVE TO MEET THAT OTHER PEOPLE 
ARE CREATING. 
>> THEIR OWN CONSTRAINTS AND IN 
SO MANY WAYS, WE ARE PARSING 
EVERY WORD SAID AT THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 
PERSPECTIVE AND BECAUSE OF THE 
DOMESTIC POLITICAL FILTER HERE, 
PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED WHAT THE 
OUTCOME OF THIS IS. 
PEOPLE ARE WALKING IN, IF YOU 
ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU HAVE 
DECIDED THAT HE IS DOING 
SOMETHING GREAT. 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG GETTING 
ALONG WITH RUSSIA. 
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT OF 
DIPLOMACY, RIGHT, IT'S SUPPOSED 
TO BE FURTHERING THE INTERESTS 
OF YOUR COUNTRY, AND CAN HE 
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ANYTHING IN 
THE MEETING. 
IF YOU'RE A DETRACTOR OF THE 
PRESIDENT, YOU THINK HE SOLD US 
DOWN THE RIVER, THAT THERE WAS 
SOME SCHOOL BOARD OF  -- SOME 
KIND OF QUID PRO QUO HERE. 
>> CAN I MAKE A POINT ON THAT 
ND SOMETHING LIZ TOUCHED ON AS 
WELL, HOW VULNERABLE IF AT ALL 
STREET MUST FEEL KNOWING THE 
DETAIL THAT PROSECUTORS HERE 
WERE ABLE TO NAIL DOWN AS FAR 
AS THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE GRU 
BECAUSE IF YOU GO BACK TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S LAST MEETING WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN WHERE HE SAID HE 
TOLD ME HE DIDN'T DO IT, AND I 
BELIEVE THAT HE BELIEVED IT, HE 
WENT ON TO SAY THAT PUTIN TOLD 
HIM I DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE NO 
ONE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO FIND 
OUT OR TRACE IT BACK TO ME. 
HOW VULNERABLE IS VLADIMIR 
PUTIN FEELING RIGHT NOW? 
DID HE THINK THIS DAY WAS 
INEVITABLE? 
BECAUSE THIS SEEMED TO COME 
FROM NOT ONLY U.S. INTELLIGENCE 
BUT BRITISH AS WELL. 
>> A NUMBER OF ALLIES HAVE BEEN 
HELPING WITH THIS. 
IT'S A FAIR POINT. 
DID THIS THIS RELEASE AND BOX 
IN THE PRESIDENT WITH THE 
MUELLER INDICTMENT BY FORCING 
THE ISSUE, DID IT ACTUALLY HELP 
HIM BECAUSE AS YOU'RE 
SUGGESTING THERE, SORT OF LAYS 
OUT 
>>>  TRUMP COULD USE THAT TO 
HIS BENEFIT. 
>> EXACTLY. 
>> IF YOU CALL IT A WITCH HUNT 
YOU ARE DISMISSING THE FACT 
THERE IS A DETERRENT TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES WHO MIGHT TRY TO DO 
SOMETHING SIMILAR AND MAYBE ARE 
DOING IT NOW AS THE DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SAYS IT'S 
HAPPENING. 
>> IT'S PUZZLING TO ME KNOWING 
THESE INDICTMENTS WERE COMING 
DOWN HE THOUGHT IT WAS A WITCH 
HUNT. 
>> THAT'S THE PERSONAL. 
HE FEELS HUNTED THERE. 
>> YES. 
LET'S GO BACK TO NORAH BECAUSE 
BEFORE THE SUMMIT STARTED THE 
PRESIDENT SAID LISTEN I HAVE 
LOW EXPECTATIONS HERE. 
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO 
OFFICIALS. 
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU WAS 
THEIR HOPE THAT WOULD COME OUT 
OF THIS? 
WHAT WAS THEIR AGENDA? 
DID THEY HAVE ONE? 
>> THAT'S WHAT WAS INCREDIBLY 
REMARKABLE, GAYLE. 
SPEAKING WHEN ASKED WHAT THE 
AGENDA WAS THEY HAD TO SHRUG 
THEIR SHOULDERS BECAUSE THEY 
WEREN'T SURE SAYING IT WAS UP 
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND THAT IS 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
THERE'S A LAUNDRY LIST OF ITEMS 
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO THROUGH 
TO DISCUSS AT A MEETING OF THIS 
TIME. 
MARGARET JUST MADE A POINT TOO. 
ONE OF THE PHRASES THE DIRECTOR 
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN 
COATS USED EARLIER THIS WEEK IS 
HE SAID HE HAD A MESSAGE FOR 
PUTIN IF HE WERE MEETING WITH 
HIM WE KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING 
AND WE KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 
ARE DOING AND WHAT WE ARE 
DOING. 
YOU MAKE THE CHOICE BUT IF YOU 
WANT TO STAY IN THIS FOR TAT WE 
ARE GOING TO BEAT YOU. 
THERE'S A MESSAGE BEING SENT 
FROM THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY. 
THERE'S A MESSAGE BEING SENT 
FROM THE U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT 
COMMUNITY AND IT WAS THE TIMING 
IS INCREDIBLY RELEVANT IT WAS 
DONE JUST DAYS BEFORE THIS 
PARTICULAR SUMMIT WHEN THE 
AGENCY PROCESS DID NOT TAKE 
PLACE THAT NORMALLY HAPPENS 
BEFORE ONE OF THESE MEETINGS 
WHERE MOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE 
DISCUSSED. 
MAJOR GARRETT IS ALSO WITH US 
HERE AND HAS HAD SIMILAR 
CONVERSATIONS WITH OFFICIALS 
AND MAJOR JUST OUT OF JUST WHAT 
HAPPENED ARE YOU GETTING ANY 
READ ABOUT WHETHER THEY AGREED 
TO ANYTHING? 
>> NO, NO READ AT ALL. 
AND THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS 
ARE SORT OF TIMEY NOT ONLY 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BUT WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN. 
WE ARE IN AN EXTENDED TWO 
MINUTE WARNING AND THIS MIGHT 
BE THE LONGEST TWO MINUTE 
WARNING I HAVE EVER BEEN APART 
OF IN PRESIDENTIAL COVERAGE. 
TO YOUR POINT YOU JUST MADE 
BECAUSE IT'S VITAL. 
I CAN TELL YOU SO MANY OF THE 
DIPLOMATS AND NATO MINISTERS 
WERE VITALLY INTERACTING AS 
ENERGETICALLY AS THEY COULD 
WITH U.S. OFFICIALS TO TRY TO 
FIND OUT IF THERE WAS A FIXED, 
SEMI FIXED, EMERGING AGENDA FOR 
THIS MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN AND THE ANSWER IS THE 
SAME YOU JUST REPORTED. 
NO THERE ISN'T AND THAT LEFT 
THEM IN A SENSE OF MILD PANIC 
BECAUSE THEIR FEAR WAS IF 
AMERICA'S AGENDA ISN'T SET AND 
EUROPE'S AGENDA ISN'T SET, THEY 
KNEW GOING IN, THE RUSSIAN 
AGENDA WOULD BE SET AND THEY 
WERE SOME WHAT FEARFUL THAT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
TAKE ADVANTAGE, DRIVE HIS 
AGENDA HARDER WHEN THERE WAS NO 
FIXED AMERICAN AGENDA GOING IN. 
AND TO THE POINT THAT YOU AND 
MARGARET HAVE JUST DESCRIBED 
ABOUT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL 
INDICTMENTS. 
THEY ARE VERY FORENSICALLY 
DETAILED AND THAT IS A SIGNAL 
TO RUSSIA AND TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 
THAT THE INSTITUTIONS IN 
AMERICA, WHATEVER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAYS ABOUT THE MEDDLING 
OR THE INVESTIGATION, THE 
INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA, THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PURSUING 
A FORENSIC EXPANSION OF WHAT 
HAPPENED AND REVEALING 
IMPORTANT DETAILS. 
AS YOU MENTION DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE 
INSTITUTIONALLY IS SPEAKING ON 
BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZING AND 
CALLING OUT IN PUBLIC WHAT 
RUSSIA HAS DONE AND WHAT HE 
BELIEVES RUSSIA IS DOING. 
SO YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF 
INTERESTING BACK DROP FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
WHATEVER HE'S SAYING ON 
TWITTER, HOWEVER HE COMPORTS 
HIMSELF FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, THE 
INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA ARE 
SENDING DISTINCT SIGNALS RIGHT 
NOW ON THEIR OWN ABOUT WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED AND WHAT MAY BE GOING 
ON AND THE THREATS THAT STILL 
EXIST. 
AND THAT WHATEVER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DOES OR DOESN'T DO IS ITS 
OWN WAY A SIGNAL TO PUTIN AND 
HIS GOVERNMENT THAT 
INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA KNOW 
WHAT'S HAPPENING AND ARE 
PREPARED TO CALL THEM OUT. 
>> AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD 
POINT, MAJOR. 
I ACTUALLY SPOKE WITH A SENIOR 
DIPLOMATIC OFFICIAL AND I ASKED 
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT IS 
GOING TO BRING UP THE RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE 
SENIOR DIP MAT SAID TO ME I'M 
NOT LOOKING BACK. 
I'M LOOKING AT NOVEMBER AND 
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND 
IF THEY DON'T CHANGE WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING IN NOVEMBER ALL BETS 
ARE OFF. 
AND I SAID DOES THE PRESIDENT 
AGREE WITH THAT? 
IS THAT THE MESSAGE THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DELIVER 
TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THIS 
DIPLOMAT SAID HE DID NOT HAVE 
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION SO 
I THINK YOU SEE ALREADY WHAT IS 
HAPPENING NOW THAT RUSSIA'S 
DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO TART 
AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC IDEALS AND 
OUR SYSTEM ARE ON GOING AND 
THERE'S A HOPE THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITIES THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WILL CONFRONT OR DID CONFRONT 
PRESIDENT PUTIN. 
LET'S GO BACK TO WEIJIA JANG 
WHO IS INSIDE THE ROOM AND 
SOMETHING APPEARS TO BE 
HAPPENING THERE. 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? 
>> NORAH YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW 
THERE IS A JOURNALIST WITH THE 
MEDIA ORGANIZATION THE NATIONS 
THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IT'S 
BECOMING QUITE VIOLENT AS HE IS 
RESISTING. 
IT STARTED WHEN HE STARTED 
HECKLING THOSE OF US WHO WERE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF REPORTING AND 
TWO MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY 
DETAIL CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT. 
HE CAME OUT AND SHOWED A SIGN 
THAT HE HAD APPARENTLY MADE 
THAT LOOKED LIKE A HAND MADE 
SIGN THAT SAID NUCLEAR WEAPON 
TREATY AND THAT'S WHEN THIS ALL 
UNFOLDED AND INTENSIFIED. 
AS YOU CAN SEE HE'S BEEN 
ESCORTED BY AN ENTIRE TEAM OF 
ABOUT TEN SECURITY OFFICIALS SO 
IT REALLY ESCALATED IN THE PAST 
TWO MINUTES I WOULD SAY HE WAS 
TAKEN INSIDE AFTER THE INITIAL 
HECKLING, BROUGHT BACK OUT HERE 
BECAUSE HE SAYS HIMSELF THAT HE 
WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING A 
MALICIOUS ITEM AND HE RETRIEVED 
THIS HAND MADE SIGN, AGAIN 
SOMETHING ABOUT A NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS TREATY AND THEN 
OFFICIALS ASKED HIM TO LEAVE. 
HE RESISTED AND THEN AS YOU 
SAW, THEY PHYSICALLY GRABBED 
HIM AND HE CONTINUED TO RESIST. 
BUT HE HAS NOW BEEN ESCORTED 
OUT OF THE ROOM. 
WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS 
COULD IMPACT THE JOINT PRESS 
CONFERENCE HERE AS YOU 
MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN WAITING 
FOR NOW FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO 
IT IS VERY TESTY IN HERE. 
YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND, NOW THE 
VOLUME HAS TURNED UP BECAUSE 
EVERYBODY IS NOW TALKING ABOUT 
IT AND I THINK THEY ARE TRYING 
TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHO HE IS 
BUT WE BELIEVE HE'S A 
JOURNALIST WITH THE NATIONS. 
NOW HIS PERSONAL ITEMS ARE 
BEING COLLECTED, HIS LAPTOP AND 
HIS BACKPACK. 
SO YOU SAW IT ALL UNFOLD. 
IT WAS A PRETTY DRAMATIC SCENE 
HERE BECAUSE THE GENTLEMAN 
REFUSED TO LEAVE EVEN AFTER 
MORE AND MORE SECURITY DETAIL 
MEMBERS TRIED TO REMOVE HIM 
FROM THE ROOM. 
SO WE WILL HAVE TO GET MORE 
CLARIFICATION ABOUT WHAT LED UP 
TO IT AND WHAT THAT SIGN SAID 
BUT FOR NOW HE'S BEEN REMOVED 
FROM THIS ROOM. 
>> OKAY. 
WEIJIA THANK YOU. 
CLEARLY SOME TYPE OF 
DISTURBANCE INSIDE THAT PRESS 
ROOM BUT WE SHOULDN'T LET IT 
DISTRACT US FROM REALLY WHAT 
ARE REAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED BETWEEN TRUMP AND 
PUTIN. 
JOHN, GAYLE, MARGARET I'LL SEND 
IT BACK TO YOU GUYS. 
>> ONE OF THE INTERESTING 
QUESTIONS IS ABOUT AN AGENDA. 
ONE IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT 
MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE THE 
PIECES ON THE BOARD AS HE 
WISHES AND ALSO TO HAVE A BIG 
REVEAL AFTER IT'S OVER. 
SUDDENLY HE'S ABLE TO GET SOME 
PIECES OF VARIOUS THINGS THAT 
HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT MAYBE A 
NEW ARMS CONTROL TREATY AND 
HAVE A BIG MESSAGE COMING OUT 
OF IT. 
THE SECOND OPTION IS WHEN 
LISTENING TO A NUMBER OF U.S. 
OFFICIALS DESCRIBE WHAT THEY 
THOUGHT U.S. POLICY SHOULD BE 
AND THEY ASKED WILL THE 
PRESIDENT SAY THAT THEY SAID WE 
HOPE SO. 
THEY ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW HE 
WILL BEHAVE AND WHETHER HE WILL 
STAY WITH U.S. POLICY AS IT'S 
BEEN ARTICULATED IN THIS 
TESTIMONY. 
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE 
MAN AT THE TOP OF THE 
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART. 
>> LET'S NOT FORGET THAT FORMER 
OFFICIAL SEAS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED 
THOSE AIDS HAVE GIVEN UP TRYING 
TO CONTROL WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
SAYS TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND WHAT 
HE SAYS ABOUT HIM. 
SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE 
LIKE FIONA HILL WHO ARE HAWKISH 
TRADITIONALLY AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE COMMUNICATION TEAMS ARE 
COMING IN SO WE SHOULD BE 
EXPECTING THE PRESIDENTS 
MOMENTARILY. 
SO ON THE FLIP SIDE OF HAVING 
HIS ADVISORS THERE AND SOME WHO 
HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN VERY 
HAWKISH ON RUSSIA AT THE END OF 
THE DAY ESPECIALLY WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO 
WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY AND WHAT 
HE DECIDES TO DO. 
>> THAT'S WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLY 
FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE 
TRYING TO BEST PREPARE HIM WITH 
FACTS YOU HEAR QUITE OFTEN WE 
ARE GOING TO INGUN DATE HIM 
WITH DATA IN THE HOPES OF 
TRYING TO PURSUE SUICIDE-
-PERSUADE HIM. 
>> THE CHALLENGE IS THE 
PRESIDENT LIKES GOING WITH HIS 
GUT ON THESE THINGS. 
THERE IS SUCH HIGH-RISK IN 
THESE DECISIONS. 
>> GIVE US A TASTE OF WHAT IT 
NORMALLY IS LIKE IN THESE KINDS 
OF SITUATIONS THE POURING OVER 
INDIVIDUAL WORDS TO KEEP FROM 
MISS IMPRESSION. 
>> THEY ARE BOTH ENTERING NOW.
>> Translator: DISTINGUISHED 
MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN, WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES DONALD 
TRUMP TO PLACE IN A FRANK AND 
LIKE ATMOSPHERE I THINK WE CAN 
CALL IT A SUCCESS AND VERY 
FRUITFUL ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS. 
WE CAREFULLY ANALYZED THE 
CURRENT PRESIDENT AND THE 
FUTURE OF THE RUSSIA UNITED 
STATES RELATIONSHIP KEY ISSUES 
OF THE GLOBAL AGENDA. 
IT'S QUITE NEW TO EVERYONE THAT 
THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
GOING THROUGH A COMPLICATED 
STANGE STANGE--STAGE AND YET 
THE CURRENT TENSION AND 
ATMOSPHERE ESSENTIALLY HAVE NO 
SOLID REASON BEHIND IT. 
THE COLD WAR IS A THING OF THE 
PAST. 
THE ERA OF ACUTE IDEOLOGY 
COMMUNICATION IS THE BEST OF 
THE BEST. 
THE SITUATION OF THE WORLD 
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. 
TO DATE BOTH RUSSIA AND THE 
UNITED STATES FACED A WHOLE NEW 
SET OF CHALLENGES. 
THOSE INCLUDE DANGEROUS 
ADJUSTMENT OF MECHANISMS FOR 
MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL 
SECURITY AND STABILITY, 
ORIGINAL CRISIS. 
THE CREEPING THREATS OF 
TERRORISM AND TRANCE NATIONAL 
CRIME. 
IF THE SNOW BALLING PROBLEMS IN 
THE ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
RISKS AND OTHER SETS OF 
CHALLENGES WE CAN ONLY COPE 
WITH THESE CHALLENGES IF WE 
JOIN THE RANKS AND WORK 
TOGETHER. 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL REACH THIS 
UNDERSTANDING WITH OUR AMERICAN 
PARTNERS. 
THESE NEGOTIATIONS REFLECTED 
OUR JOINT WISH WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TO REDRESS THIS NEGATIVE 
SITUATION AND BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP. 
OUT LINE THE FIRST STEPS FOR 
IMPROVING THE RELATIONSHIP TO 
RESTORE THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF 
TRUST AND GOING BACK TO THE 
PREVIOUS LEVEL OF INTERACTION 
ON ALL MUTUAL INTEREST ISSUES. 
AS MAJOR NUCLEAR POWERS, WE 
BEAR SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
IT IS VITAL AND WE MENTIONED 
THIS DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS 
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE FINE TUNE 
THE STRATEGIC STABILITY AND 
GLOBAL SECURITY AND NON--OF 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
WE SUBMITTED OUR AMERICAN 
COLLEAGUES WITH A NOTE WITH A 
NUMBER OF SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS. 
WE BELIEVE IT NECESSARY TO WORK 
TOGETHER FURTHER ON TO INTERACT 
ON THE DISCERNMENT AGENDA, 
METEOROLOGY COMPETITION. 
THIS INCLUDES THE EXTENSION OF 
THE STRATEGIC ARMS TREATY. 
IT'S A DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH 
THE GLOBAL AMERICAN DEFENSE 
SYSTEM AS THE IMPLEMENTATION 
ISSUES WITH THE IMF TREATY AND 
OF COURSE THE AGENDA ON NON 
PLACEMENT WEAPONS IN SPACE. 
WE FAVORED THE CONTINUED 
OPERATION IN COUNTER TERRORISM 
AND MAINTAIN SIGNER SECURITY. 
AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT 
SPECIFICALLY THAT OUR SPECIAL 
SERVICES ARE OPERATING QUITE 
SUCCESSFULLY. 
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS 
THEIR OPERATION WITH THEM THE 
RECENTLY CONCLUDED WORLD FUTBOL 
CUP. 
IN GENERAL, THE CONTACTS AMONG 
THE SPECIAL SERVICES SHOULD BE 
PUT TO A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS, 
SHOULD BE A SYSTEMATIC 
FRAMEWORK. 
I RECALL I REMINDED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ABOUT THE SUGGESTION TO 
REESTABLISH THE WORKING GROUP 
ON ANTI TERRORIST. 
WE ALSO MENTIONED THE CRISIS IS 
NOT ALWAYS THAT OUR POSTURE IS 
DUFF DALE EXACTLY AND MUTUAL 
INTEREST ABOUND WE HAVE TO LOOK 
FOR POINTS OF CONTACT AND 
INTERACT CLOSER IN A VARIETY OF 
INTERNATIONAL. 
CLEARLY WE MENTIONED THE 
REGIONAL CRISIS FOR INSTANCE, 
SYRIA. 
AS FAR AS SYRIA IS CONCERNED 
THE TASK OF SUSTAINING PEACE 
AND RECONCILIATION IN THIS 
COUNTRY COULD BE THE FIRST SHOW 
CASE OF THE SUCCESSFUL JOINT 
WORK. 
RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES 
APPARENTLY CAN TAKE LEADERSHIP 
IN THIS ISSUE AND ORGANIZE 
INTERACTION TO OVER COME 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND HELPS 
SOUTHEASTERN REFUGEES TO GO 
BACK TO THEIR HOMES. 
IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS 
LEVEL OF SUCCESSFUL COMPETITION 
IN SYRIA BOTH RUSSIAN AND 
AMERICAN MILITARY ARE ACQUIRED 
TO USEFUL EXPERIENCE OF THEIR 
ACTION ESTABLISHED THE 
OPERATIONAL CHANNELS OF 
COMMUNICATION WHICH PERMITTED 
TO AVOID DANGEROUS INCIDENTS 
AND UNINTENTIONAL COLLISIONS IN 
THE AIR AND ON THE GROUND. 
ALSO, CRUSHING TERRORISTS IN 
THE SOUTH WEST OF SYRI. 
THE SOUTH OF SYRIA SHOULD BE 
BROUGHT TO THE FULL COMPLIANCE 
WITH THE TREATY OF 1974 ABOUT 
THE SEPARATION OF FORCES OF 
ISRAEL AND SYRIA. 
THIS WILL BRING PEACE TO GOLDEN 
HEIGHTS AND BRING A MORE 
PEACEFUL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
SYRIA AND ISRAEL AND ALSO TO 
PROVIDE THE SECURITY OF ISRAEL. 
MR. PRESIDENT PAID SPECIAL 
ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE IN 
TODAY'S NEGOTIATIONS AND I'D 
LIKE TO CONFIRM THAT RUSSIA IS 
INTERESTED IN THIS DEVELOPMENT 
AND THIS WILL ACT ACCORDINGLY. 
THUS FAR, WE WILL MAKE A STEP 
TOWARDS CREATING A LASTING 
PEACE. 
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
RESPECTIVE RESOLUTIONS OF 
SECURITY COUNCIL FOR INSTANCE 
THE RESOLUTION 338, WE ARE GLAD 
THAT THE KOREAN PENINSULA ISSUE 
IS STARTING TO RESOLVE TO GREAT 
EXTENT IT WAS POSSIBLE THANKS 
TO THE PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO OPTED FOR 
DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF 
CONFRONTATION. 
WE ALSO MENTIONED OUR CONCERN 
ABOUT THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE 
UNITED STATES FROM THE JCPOA. 
THE U.S. COUNTER PARTS ARE 
AWARE OF OUR POSTURE. 
BUT WE REMIND YOU THANKS TO THE 
I RAIN YAN NUCLEAR DEAL IT 
EFFECTIVELY ENSURES THE 
EXCLUSIVELY PEACEFUL NATURE OF 
THE IRANIAN. 
WE PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. 
AT THE SAME TIME THE UNITED 
STATES COULD BE MORE DECISIVE 
IN NUDGING THE URANIAN 
LEADERSHIP AND ENCOURAGE IT TO 
PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ECONOMIC 
TIES AND ECONOMIC OPERATIONS. 
IT'S CLEAR THE BUSINESS OF BOTH 
COUNTRIES ARE INTERESTED IN 
THIS. 
AMERICAN DELEGATION WAS ONE OF 
THE LARGEST IN THE ST. 
PETERSBURG ECONOMIC FORUM. 
IT FEATURED OVER 500 
REPRESENTATIVES OF AMERICAN 
BUSINESSES. 
WE AGREED, ME AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, WE AGREED TO CREATE A 
HIGH LEVEL WORKING GROUP THAT 
CAN BRING TOGETHER CAPTAINS OF 
RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN BUSINESS. 
AFTER ALL, ENTREPRENEURS AND 
BUSINESS MEN KNOW BETTER HOW TO 
ARTICULATE THIS SUCCESSFUL 
BUSINESS CORPORATION ALL WHILE 
MAKING THEIR PROPOSALS AND 
SUGGESTIONS IN THIS REGARD. 
ONCE AGAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF THE SO-
CALLED INTERFERENCE OF RUSSIA 
WHEN THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS AND 
I HAD TO REITERATE THINGS I 
SAID SEVERAL TIMES INCLUDING IN 
PERSON THAT THE RUSSIAN STATE 
HAS NEVER INTERFERED AND IS NOT 
GOING TO INTERFERE INTO 
INTERNAL AMERICAN AFFAIRS 
INCLUDING THE ELECTION PROCESS. 
ANY SPECIFIC MATERIAL IF SUCH 
THINGS ARISE WE ARE READY TO 
ANALYZE TOGETHER. 
FOR INSTANCE WE CAN ANALYZE 
THEM THROUGH THE JOINT WORKING 
GROUP ON CYBER SECURITY THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF WHICH WE 
DISCUSSED DURING OUR PREVIOUS 
CONTACTS. 
AND CLEARLY, IT'S PASTIME WE 
RESTORE OUR OPERATION IN THE 
CULTURAL AREA, IN THE HUE 
PLANTAIN AREA. 
AS FAR AS I THINK YOU KNOW THAT 
RECENTLY WE HOSTED THE AMERICAN 
CONGRESS MAN DELEGATION AND NOW 
IT'S PERCEIVED OR PORTRAYED 
ALMOST AS A HISTORIC EVENT 
ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
CURRENT AFFAIRS, BUSINESS AS 
USUAL. 
IN A BUSINESS REGARD WE 
MENTIONED THE PROPOSAL TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE 
PRACTICALITIES ABOUT OUR 
COMPRESSION BUT ALSO THE LOGIC 
OF IT AND WE HAVE TO ENGAGE 
EXPERTS ON BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP WHO KNOW HISTORY 
IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR 
RELATIONSHIP. 
THE IDEA 17 TO CREATE AN EXPERT 
COUNCIL THAT WOULD INCLUDE 
POLITICAL SCIENTISTS PROMINENT 
MILITARY EXPERTS ON BOTH 
COUNTRIES WHO HAVE LOOKED FOR 
POINTS OF CONTACT BETWEEN THOSE 
TWO COUNTRIES AND TO LOOK FOR 
WAYS ON PUTTING THE 
RELATIONSHIP ON THE TRAJECTORY 
OF GROWTH. 
IN GENERAL WE ARE GLAD FOR THE 
OUTCOME OF OUR FIRST FULL SCALE 
MEETING BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY WE 
ONLY HAD A CHANCE TO TALK 
BRIEFLY ON INTERNATIONAL FORUM. 
WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I HOPE THAT 
WE START TO UNDERSTAND EACH 
OTHER BETTER AND I'M GRATEFUL 
TO DONALD FOR IT. 
CLEARLY THERE ARE SOME 
CHALLENGES LEFT WHEN WE WERE 
NOT ABLE TO CLEAR ALL OF THE 
BACK LOG BUT I THINK WE MADE 
THE FIRST IMPORTANT STEP IN 
THIS DIRECTION AND IN 
CONCLUSION I WANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT THIS ATMOSPHERE OF 
CORPORATION IS SOMETHING THAT 
WE ARE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR 
TO OUR FINISH HOSTS. 
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR FINISH 
PEOPLE AND FINISH LEADERSHIP 
FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. 
I KNOW THAT THE CONVENIENCE TO 
FINLAND AND WE APOLOGIZE FOR 
IT. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
I HAVE JUST CONCLUDED A MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN ON A WIDE 
RANGE OF CRITICAL ISSUES FOR 
BOTH OF OUR COUNTRIES. 
WE ARE DIRECT OPEN DEEPLY 
PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE. 
IT WENT VERY WELL. 
BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK 
PRESIDENT NINISTO OF FINLAND 
FOR GRACIOUSLY HOSTING TODAY'S 
SUMMIT. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I WERE 
SAYING HOW LOVELY IT WAS AND 
WHAT A GREAT JOB THEY DID. 
I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE 
RUSSIA AND PRESIDENT PUTIN FOR 
HAVING DONE SUCH AN EXCELLENT 
JOB IN HOSTING THE WORLD CUP. 
IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE BEST 
EVER AND YOUR TEAM ALSO DID 
VERY WELL. 
IT WAS A GREAT JOB. 
I'M HERE TODAY TO CONTINUE THE 
PROUD TRADITION OF BOLD 
AMERICAN DIPLOMACY. 
FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR 
REPUBLICAN LEADERS UNDERSTOOD 
THAT DIPLOMACY AND ENGAGEMENT 
IS PREFERRABLE TO CONFLICT AND 
HOSTILITY. 
A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE IS NOT 
ONLY GOOD FOR THE UNITED STATES 
AND GOOD FOR RUSSIA BUT IT IS 
GOOD FOR THE WORLD. 
THE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN OUR 
TWO COUNTRIES ARE WELL KNOWN 
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I 
DISCUSSED THEM AT LENGTH TODAY. 
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE 
MANY OF THE PROBLEMS FACING OUR 
WORLD THEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO FIND WAYS TO COOPERATE IN 
PURSUIT OF SHARED INTERESTS. 
TOO OFTEN IN BOTH RECENT PAST 
AND LONG AGO, WE HAVE SEEN THE 
CONSEQUENCES WHEN DIPLOMACY IS 
LEFT ON THE TABLE. 
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE BENEFITS 
OF COOPERATION. 
IN THE LAST CENTURY OUR NATIONS 
FOUGHT LONG SIDE ONE ANOTHER IN 
THE SECOND WORLD WAR. 
EVEN DURING THE TENSIONS OF THE 
COLD WAR WHEN THE WORLD LOOKED 
MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IT DOES 
TODAY, THE UNITED STATES AND 
RUSSIA WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A 
STRONG DIALOGUE. 
BUT OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS NEVER 
BEEN WORSE THAN IT IS NOW. 
HOWEVER, THAT CHANGED AS OF 
ABOUT FOUR HOURS AGO. 
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. 
NOTHING WOULD BE EASIER 
POLITICALLY THAN TO REFUSE TO 
MEET, TO REFUSE TO ENGAGE BUT 
THAT WOULD NOT ACCOMPLISH 
ANYTHING. 
AS PRESIDENT I CANNOT MAKE 
DECISIONS ON FOREIGN POLICY. 
IN A FOOT CRITICAL EFFORT TO 
APPEASE PARTISAN CRITICS OR THE 
MEDIA OR DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO 
DO NOTHING BUT RESIST AND 
OBSTRUCT. 
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN NEW 
PATHWAYS TOWARDS PEACE AND 
STABILITY IN OUR WORLD. 
I WOULD RATHER TAKE A POLITICAL 
RISK IN PURSUIT OF PEACE THAN 
TO RISK PEACE IN PURSUIT OF 
POLITICS. 
AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS PUT 
WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA AND 
WHAT IS BEST FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
DURING TODAY'S MEETING I 
ADDRESS DIRECTLY WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN THE ISSUE OF RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 
I FELT THIS WAS A MESSAGE BEST 
DELIVERED IN PERSON. 
SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME 
TALKING ABOUT IT AND PRESIDENT 
PUTIN MAY VERY WELL WANT TO 
ADDRESS IT AND VERY STRONGLY 
BECAUSE HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY 
ABOUT IT AND HAS AN INTERESTING 
IDEA. 
WE ALSO DISCUSSED ONE OF THE 
MOST CRITICAL CHALLENGES FACING 
HUMANITY. 
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. 
I PROVIDED AN UPDATE AT MY 
MEETING LAST MONTH WITH 
CHAIRMAN KIM ON THE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 
AND AFTER TODAY I AM VERY SURE 
THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN AND RUSSIA 
PROBLEM AND ARE GOING TO WORK 
WITH US. 
AND I APPRECIATE THAT 
COMMITMENT. 
THE PRESIDENT AND I ALSO 
DISCUSSED THE RADICAL ISLAMIC 
TERRORISM. 
BOTH RUSSIA AND THE UNITED 
STATES HAVE SUFFERED. 
HORRIFIC TERRORIST ATTACKS AND 
WE HAVE AGREED TO MAINTAIN OPEN 
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR 
SECURITY AGENCIES TO PROTECT 
OUR CITIZENS FROM THIS GLOBAL 
MENACE. 
LAST YEAR WE TOLD RUSSIA ABOUT 
A PLANNED ATTACK IN ST. 
PETERSBURG AND THEY WERE ABLE 
TO STOP IT COLD. 
THEY FOUND THEM, THEY STOPPED 
THEM. 
THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 
I APPRECIATED PRESIDENT PUTIN'S 
PHONE CALL AFTERWARDS TO THANK 
ME. 
I ALSO EMPHASIZED THE 
IMPORTANCE IN PLACING PRESSURE 
ON IRAN TO HALT ITS NUCLEAR 
AMBITIONS AND TO STOP ITS 
CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT 
THE AREA AND THROUGHOUT THE 
MIDDLE EAST. 
AS WE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH, THE 
CRISIS IN SYRIA IS A COMPLEX 
ONE. 
COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO 
COUNTRIES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 
SAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
LIVES. 
I ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THE 
UNITED STATES WILL NOT ALLOW 
IRAN TO BENEFIT FROM OUR 
SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
ISIS. 
WE HAVE JUST ABOUT ERAT 
INDICATED ISIS IN THE AREA. 
WE ALSO AGREED THAT 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCILS WILL 
MEET TO FOLLOW UP ON ALL OF THE 
ISSUES WE ADDRESSED TODAY AND 
TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS WE 
HAVE STARTED RIGHT HERE. 
TODAY'S MEETING IS ONLY THE 
BEGINNING OF A LONGER PROCESS. 
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST 
STEPS TOWARDS A BRIGHTER FUTURE 
AND ONE WITH A STRONG DIALOGUE 
AND A LOT OF THOUGHT. 
OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE GROUNDED 
IN REALISM BUT OUR HOPES ARE 
DESIRE FOR FRIENDSHIP, 
COOPERATION AND PEACE AND I 
THINK I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF 
RUSSIA WHEN I SAY THAT ALSO. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR JOINING ME 
FOR THESE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS 
AND FOR ADVANCING OPEN DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE UNITED 
STATES. 
OUR MEETING CARRIES ON A LONG 
TRADITION OF DIPLOMACY BETWEEN 
RUSSIA, THE UNITED STATES FOR 
THE GREATER GOOD OF ALL AND 
THIS WAS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE 
DAY. 
THIS WAS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE 
FEW HOURS THAT WE SPENT 
TOGETHER. 
IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH OF 
OUR COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE OUR 
CONVERSATION AND WE HAVE AGREED 
TO DO SO. 
I'M SURE WE'LL BE MEETING AGAIN 
IN THE FUTURE OFTEN. 
AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SOLVE 
EVERY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT 
WE DISCUSSED TODAY SO AGAIN 
PRESIDENT PUTIN, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
>> THE PRESIDENTS, NOW THE 
JOURNALISTS WILL HAVE A CHANCE 
TO ASK TWO SETS OF QUESTIONS. 
EACH FIRST THE RUSSIAN 
JOURNALIST WILL ASK A QUESTION. 
PLEASE GIVE YOUR AFFILIATION. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS 
INTERFAX AGENCY. 
I HAVE A QUESTION TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
DURING YOUR RECENT EUROPEAN 
TOUR YOU MENTIONED THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NORTH 
STREAM TO GAS PIPELINE MAKES 
EUROPE A HOSTAGE OF RUSSIA AND 
YOU SUGGESTED THAT YOU COULD 
FREE EUROPE FROM THIS BY 
SUPPLYING AMERICAN ENERGY. 
BUT THIS COLD WINTER ACTUALLY 
SHOWED THAT THE CURRENT MODEL, 
CURRENT MECHANISM OF SUPPLIED 
FUEL TO EUROPE IS QUITE VIABLE. 
AT THE SAME TIME, AS FAR AS I 
KNOW, U.S. HAD TO BUY EVEN 
RUSSIAN GAS FOR BOSTON. 
I HAVE A QUESTION, THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF YOUR IDEA HAS 
A POLITICAL CHANGE TO IT OR IS 
IT A PRACTICAL ONE BECAUSE 
THERE WILL BE A GAP FORMED IN 
THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND MECHANISM 
AND THE FIRST OF THE CONSUMING 
COUNTRIES WHO WILL FALL INTO 
THIS GAP AND THE SECOND 
QUESTION BEFORE THE MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN YOU CALLED 
HIM AN ADVERSERY ARRIVAL AND 
YET ABLE TO BRING THIS 
RELATIONSHIP TO A NEW LEVEL. 
DID YOU MENTION THIS? 
>> ACTUALLY I CALLED HIM A 
COMPETITOR AND A GOOD 
COMPETITOR HE IS AND I THINK 
THE WORD COMPETITOR IS A 
COMPLIMENT. 
I THINK THAT WE WILL BE 
COMPETING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 
THE PIPELINE. 
I'M NOT SURE NECESSARILY THAT 
IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF 
GERMANY OR NOT BUT THAT WAS A 
DECISION THAT THEY MADE. 
WE'LL BE COMPETING AS YOU KNOW 
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW OR 
SOON WILL BE BUT I THINK IT 
ACTUALLY IS RIGHT NOW THE 
LARGEST IN THE OIL AND GAS 
WORLD SO WE'LL HAVE TO BE 
COMPETING WITH THE PIPELINE AND 
I THINK WE'LL COMPETE 
SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THERE IS 
AN ADVANTAGE LOCATION WISE. 
I JUST WISHED THEM LUCK. 
I DID. 
I DISCUSSED WITH ANGELA MERKEL 
IN PRETTY STRONG TONES BUT I 
ALSO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE ALL 
COMING FROM AND THEY HAVE A 
VERY CLOSE SOURCE SO WE'LL SEE 
HOW THAT ALL WORKS OUT BUT WE 
HAVE LOTS OF SOURCES NOW AND 
THE UNITED STATES IS MUCH 
DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS A NUMBER 
OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE WEREN'T 
ABLE TO EXTRACT WHAT WE CAN 
EXTRACT TODAY. 
TODAY WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN THE 
WORLD AT THAT AND I THINK WE'LL 
BE OUT THERE COMPETING VERY 
STRONGLY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> IF I MAY THROW IN MY TWO 
CENTS WE TALKED TO THE 
PRESIDENT INCLUDING THE SUBJECT 
AS WELL. 
WE ARE AWAR OF THE EXTENTS OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I THINK 
THAT WE AS A MAJOR OIL AND GAS 
SUPPLIER AND THE UNITED STATES 
IS A MAJOR OIL AND GAS POWER AS 
WELL WE CAN WORK WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE 
NEITHER OF US IS INTERESTED IN 
THE PLUM YETING OF THE PRICES 
AND THE CONSUMERS WILL SUFFER 
AS WELL AND THE CONSUMERS IN 
THE UNITED STATES WILL SUFFER 
AS WELL AND THE GAS PRODUCTION 
WILL SUFFER BECAUSE BEYOND A 
SUDDEN PRICE BREAKUP IT'S NO 
LONGER PROFITABLE TO PRODUCE 
GAS BUT NOR WE ARE INTERESTED 
IN DRIVING PRICES UP BECAUSE IT 
WILL DRAIN JUICES FROM ALL 
OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. 
SO WE DO HAVE SPACE FOR 
CORPORATION HERE IS THE FIRST 
THING. 
THEN ABOUT THE NORTH STREAM 
TOO. 
MR. PRESIDENT VOICED HIS 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF 
TRACTIONIT THROUGH I CRAIN AND 
I REASSURED RUSSIA STANDS READY 
TO MAINTAIN THIS TRANSIT. 
MORE OVER TO EXTEND THIS 
TRANSIT TO EXTEND NEXT YEAR. 
THE DISPUTE WILL BE SETTLED IN 
THE ARBITRATION COURT. 
>> THE FIRST QUESTION TO JEFF 
BASIN FROM REUTERS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU TWEETED THIS 
MORNING THAT IT'S U.S. 
FOOLISHNESS, STUPIDITY AND THE 
MUELLER PROBE THAT IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DINE IN 
U.S. RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 
DO YOU HOLD RUSSIA AT ALL 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANYTHING IN 
PARTICULAR AND IF SO WHAT WOULD 
YOU CONSIDER THEM THAT THEY ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR? 
>> YES I DO HOLD BOTH COUNTRIES 
RESPONSIBLE. 
I THINK THE UNITED STATES HAS 
BLOOD PRESSURE FOOLISH. 
I THINK WE HAVE ALL BEEN 
FOOLISH. 
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS 
DIALOGUE A LONG TIME AGO, A 
LONG TIME FRANKLY BEFORE I GOT 
TO OFFICE AND I THINK WE ARE 
ALL TO BLAME. 
I THINK THAT THE UNITED STATES 
NOW HAS STEPPED FORWARD ALONG 
WITH RUSSIA AND WE ARE GETTING 
TOGETHER AND WE HAVE A CHANCE 
TO DO GREAT THINGS WHETHER IT'S 
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IN TERMS 
OF STOPPING. 
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
TO WORK ON. 
I DO FEEL THAT WE HAVE BOTH 
MADE SOME MISTAKES. 
I THINK THAT THE PROBE IS A 
DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
I THINK IT'S KEPT US APART. 
IT'S KEPT US SEPARATED. 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AT ALL. 
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT AND PEOPLE 
ARE BEING BROUGHT OUT TO THE 4. 
SO FAR THAT I KNOW VIRTUALLY 
NONE OF IT RELATED TO THE 
CAMPAIGN AND THEY ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO TRY REALLY HARD TO FIND 
SOMEBODY THAT DID RELATE TO THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
THAT WAS A CLEAN CAMPAIGN. 
I BEAT HILARY CLINTON EASILY 
AND FRANKLY WE BEAT HER AND I'M 
NOT EVEN SAYING FROM THE 
STANDPOINT. 
WE WON THAT RACE AND IT'S A 
SHAME THERE COULD BE A LITTLE 
BIT OF A CLOUD OVER IT. 
PEOPLE KNOW THAT, PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND IT BUT THE MAIN 
THING WE DISCUSSED IS ALSO ZERO 
COLLUSION AND IT HAS HAD A 
NEGATIVE IMPACT UPON THE 
RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO LARGEST 
NUCLEAR POWERS IN THE WORLD. 
WE HAVE 90% OF NUCLEAR POWER 
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. 
IT'S RIDICULOUS. 
IT'S RIDICULOUS WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH THE PROBE. 
>> PRESIDENT, IF I COULD FOLLOW 
UP AS WELL. 
WHY SHOULD AMERICANS AND WHY 
SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVE 
YOUR STATEMENT THAT RUSSIA DID 
NOT INTERVENE IN THE 2016 
ELECTION GIVEN THE EVIDENCE 
THAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 
HAVE PROVIDED AND WILL YOU 
CONSIDER EXTRADITING THE 12 
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS THAT WERE 
INDICTED. 
>> I'M GOING TO LET THE 
PRESIDENT ANSWER THE SECOND 
PART OF THAT QUESTION BUT AS 
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE CONCEPT CAME 
UP PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT BEFORE 
BUT IT CAME OUT AS A REASON WHY 
THE DEMOCRATS LOST AN ELECTION 
WHICH FRANKLY THEY SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO WIN BECAUSE IT'S 
MUCH MORE AS YOU KNOW TO 
DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS. 
WE WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BY 
A LOT. 
306 TO 223 I BELIEVE. 
AND THAT WAS A WELL FOUGHT 
BATTLE. 
WE DID A GREAT JOB. 
AND FRANKLY I'M GOING TO LET 
THE PRESIDENT SPEAK TO THE 
SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION 
BUT TO SAY IT ONE TIME AGAIN 
AND TO SAY IT ALL THE TIME. 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 
I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT. 
THERE WAS NOBODY TO CONCLUDE 
WITH. 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION WITH THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
EVERY TIME YOU HEAR ALL OF 
THESE 12 AND 14. 
IT'S STUFF THAT HAS NOTHING TO 
DO AND FRANKLY THEY ADMIT THESE 
ARE NOT PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE 
CAMPAIGN BUT TO THE AVERAGE 
READER OUT THERE THEY ARE 
SAYING WELL MAYBE THAT DOES. 
IT DOESN'T ADD EVEN THE PEOPLE 
INVOLVED SOME PERHAPS TOLD MISS 
STORIES OR IN ONE CASE THE 
F.B.I. 
SAID THERE WAS NO LIE. 
THERE WAS NO LIE. 
SOMEBODY ELSE SAID THERE WAS. 
WE RAN A BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN AND 
THAT'S WHY I'M PRESIDENT. 
THANK YOU. 
>> AS TO WHO IS TO BE BELIEVED 
AND WHO IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED, 
YOU CAN TRUST NO ONE IF YOU 
TAKE THIS. 
WHERE DID YOU GET THE IDEA THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TRUSTS ME OR I 
TRUST HIM? 
HE DEFENDS THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA AND I DO DEFEND THE 
RUSSIAN FEDERATIO. 
WE DO HAVE INTERESTS IN COMMON. 
WE ARE LOOKING FOR POINTS OF 
CONTACT. 
THERE ARE ISSUES WHERE OUR 
POSTURES DIVERGE AND WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO RECONCILE 
OUR DIFFERENCES, HOW TO MAKE 
OUR EFFORT MORE MEANINGFUL. 
WE SHOULD NOT PROCEED FROM THE 
IMMEDIATE POLITICAL INTERESTS 
THAT GUIDE CERTAIN POLITICAL 
POWERS IN OUR COUNTRIES. 
WE SHOULD BE GUIDED BY EFFECTS. 
COULD YOU NAME A SINGLE FACT 
THAT WHAT DEFINITIVELY PROVE 
THE COLLUSION. 
THIS IS NONSENSE. 
JUST LIKE THE PRESIDENT 
RECENTLY MENTIONED THE AT LARGE 
UNITED STATES HAD A PERCEIVED 
CANDIDATE DURING THE CAMPAIGN 
BUT THERE IS NOTHING 
PARTICULARLY EXTRAORDINARY 
ABOUT IT. 
THAT'S THE USUAL THING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS A 
CANDIDATE HE MENTIONED THE NEED 
TO RESTORE THE RUSSIA U.S. 
RELATIONSHIP AND IT'S CLEAR 
THAT CERTAIN PART OF AMERICAN 
SOCIETY FELT SYMPATHETIC ABOUT 
IT AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE COULD 
EXPRESS THEIR SYMPATHY IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ISN'T THAT 
NATURAL? 
ISN'T IT NATURAL TO BE 
SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS THE PERSON 
WILLING TO RESTORE THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COUNTRY 
WHO WANTS TO WORK WITH US? 
WE HEARD THE ACCUSATIONS ABOUT 
IT. 
AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS COMPANY 
HIRED AMERICAN LAWYERS AND THE 
ACCUSATIONS DOESN'T HAVE A 
FIGHTING CHANCE IN THE AMERICAN 
COURTS. 
SO THERE'S NO EVIDENCE WHEN IT 
COMES TO THE ACTUAL FACTS SO WE 
HAVE TO BE GUIDED BY FACTS NOT 
BY RUMORS. 
NOW LET'S GET BACK TO THIS 12 
ALLEGED INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS 
OF RUSSIA. 
I DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF 
THE SITUATION BUT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP MENTIONED THIS ISSUE AND 
I WILL LOOK INTO IT. 
SO FAR I CAN SAY THE FOLLOWING. 
THE THINGS THAT OFF THE TOP OF 
MY HEAD, WE HAVE ENACTED AN 
EXISTING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND 
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION DISTANT 
TREATY THAT DATES BACK TO 1999 
THAT MUTUAL ASSISTANCE ON 
CRIMINAL CASES THIS TREATY IS 
IN FULL EFFECT. 
IT WORKS QUITE EFFICIENTLY. 
ON AVERAGE WE INITIATE ABOUT 
150 CRIMINAL CASES UPON REQUEST 
FROM THE UNITED STATES. 
FOR INSTANCE LAST YEAR THERE 
WAS ONE EXTRADITION CASE UPON 
REQUEST SENT BY THE UNITED 
STATES. 
SO THIS TREATY HAS SPECIFIC 
LEGAL PROCEDURES WE CAN OFFER 
THAT THE APPROPRIATE COMMISSION 
HEADED BY SPECIAL MUELLER HE 
CAN USE THIS FORMAL OFFICIAL 
REQUEST TO US SO THAT WE WOULD 
INFOBLOX BETTER GAIT, WE WOULD 
HOLD THE QUESTIONING OF THESE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO HE BELIEVES ARE 
A PREVIEW TO SOME CRIMES AND 
OUR ENFORCEMENT ARE PERFECTLY 
ABLE TO DO THIS QUESTIONING AND 
SEND THE MATERIAL TEASE THE 
UNITED STATES. 
MORE OVER WE CAN MEET YOU 
HALFWAY AND MAKE ANOTHER STEP. 
CAN ACTUALLY PERMIT OFFICIAL 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED 
STATES INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF 
THIS VERY COMMISSION HEADED BY 
MR. MUELLER WE CAN LEAD INTO 
THE COUNTRY AND PRESENT WITH 
QUESTIONING BUT IN THIS CASE 
THERE IS ANOTHER CONDITION. 
THIS KIND OF EFFORT SHOULD BE A 
MUTUAL ONE. 
THEN WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE 
AMERICANS WOULD RECIPROCATE AND 
THEY WOULD QUESTION OFFICIALS 
INCLUDING THE OFFICERS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICES OF THE UNITED STATES 
WHOM WE BELIEVE ARE WHO HAVE 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH ILLEGAL 
ACTIONS ON THE TERRITORY OF 
RUSSIA AND WE HAVE TO REQUEST 
THE PRESENCE OF OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
FOR INSTANCE WE CAN BRING UP 
THE MR. BROWNER IN THIS 
PARTICULAR CASE. 
ASSOCIATES OF MR. BROWNER HAVE 
EARNED OVER $1.5 MILLION IN 
RUSSIA. 
THEY NEVER PAID ANY TAXES 
NEITHER IN RUSSIA OR THE UNITED 
STATES AND YET THE MONEY 
ESCAPED THE COUNTRY. 
THEY WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
THEY SENT A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY, $400 MILLION AS A 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE CAMPAIGN OF 
HILARY CLINTON. 
WELL THAT'S THEIR PERSONAL 
CASE, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEGAL. 
THE CONTRIBUTION ITSELF, BUT 
THE WAY THE MONEY WAS EARNED 
WAS ILLEGAL. 
SO WE HAVE A SOLID REASON TO 
BELIEVE THAT SOME INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS THE COMPANY GUIDED 
THESE TRANSACTIONS SO WE HAVE 
AN INTEREST OF QUESTIONING 
THAT. 
THAT COULD BE THE FIRST STEP 
AND WE CAN ALSO EXTEND IT. 
OPTIONS ARE BOUND AND THEY ALL 
CAN BE FOUND IN AN APPROPRIATE 
LEGAL FRAMEWORK. 
>> DID YOU DIRECT ANY OF YOUR 
OFFICIALS TO HELP HIM DO THAT? 
>> YES, I DID. 
BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT 
BRINGING THE RIGHT U.S. RUSSIA 
RELATIONSHIP BACK TO NORMAL I 
THINK THERE CAN BE THREE 
QUESTIONS FROM THE RUSSIAN PULL 
TODAY YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
GOOD EVENING TO EVERYONE. 
MY NAME IS. 
RT, T.V. 
CHANNEL. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU 
PLEASE GO INTO THE DETAILS OF 
POSSIBLY ANY SPECIFIC 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE U.S. TO 
WORK TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA IN 
SYRIA IF ANY OF THESE KIND OF 
ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TODAY OR 
DISCUSSED.
>> IS IT TRUE AND HOW WOULD YOU 
USE THIS FACT? 
>> WELL I GUESS I'LL ANSWER THE 
FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION. 
WE'VE WORKED WITH ISRAEL LONG 
AND HARD FOR MANY YEARS, MANY 
DECADES. 
I THINK NEVER HAS ANYONE ANY 
COUNTRY BEEN CLOSER THAN WE 
ARE. 
PRESIDENT PUTIN ALSO IS HELPING 
ISRAEL AND WE BOTH SPOKE WITH 
AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO 
CERTAIN THINGS WITH RESPECT TO 
SYRIA HAVING TO DO WITH THE 
SAFETY OF ISRAEL. 
SO IN THAT RESPECT WE 
ABSOLUTELY WOULD LIKE TO WORK 
IN ORDER TO HELP ISRAEL AND 
ISRAEL WOULD BE WORKING WITH US 
SO BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD BE 
WORKING JOINTLY. 
AND I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
ALL OF THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN 
MADE IN CERTAIN SECTIONS WITH 
THE ERAD OCCASION OF ISIS ABOUT 
99% INTEREST AND OTHER THINGS 
HAVE TAKEN PLACE THAT WE'VE 
DONE AND FRANKLY RUSSIA HAS 
HELPED US WITH CERTAIN RESPECTS 
BUT I THINK WORKING WITH ISRAEL 
IS A GREAT THING AND CREATING 
SAFETY FOR ISRAEL IS SOMETHING 
THAT BOTH PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE VERY MUCH. 
ONE LITTLE THING I MIGHT ADD TO 
THAT IS THE HELPING OF PEOPLE. 
HELPING OF PEOPLE. 
YOU HAVE SUCH HORRIBLE--I'VE 
SEEN REPORTS AND I'VE SEEN 
PICTURES, I'VE SEEN JUST ABOUT 
EVERYTHING. 
AND IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO 
HELP THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA GET 
BACK INTO SOME FORM OF SHELTER 
AND ON A HUMANITARIAN BASIS 
THAT'S WHAT THE WORD WAS 
REALLY, A HUE PLANTAIN BASIS 
BOTH OF US WOULD BE VERY 
INTERESTED IN DOING THAT AND WE 
WILL DO THAT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> EXCUSE ME, BUT FOR NOW NO 
SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS FOR 
INSTANCE BETWEEN THE 
MILITARIES? 
>> OUR MILITARIES DO GET ALONG. 
OUR MILITARIES HAVE GOTTEN 
ALONG BETTER THAN OUR POLITICAL 
LEADERS FOR YEARS BUT THEY DO 
COORDINATE IN SYRIA AND OTHER 
PLACES. 
OKAY? 
THANK YOU. 
>> YES, WE DID MENTION THIS. 
WE MENTIONED THE HUMANITARIAN 
TRACK OF THIS ISSUE. 
YESTERDAY I DISCUSSED THIS WITH 
FRENCH PRESIDENT MR. MACRON AND 
WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT THAT 
TOGETHER WITH EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES INCLUDING FRANCE WE 
WILL STEP UP THIS EFFORT AND ON 
OUR BEHALF WE PROVIDE MILITARY 
CARGO AIRCRAFT TO DELIVER THE 
HUMANITARIAN CARGO. 
TODAY I BROUGHT UP THIS WITH 
ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF 
THINGS TO LOOK INTO. 
THE CRUCIAL THING IS THAT A 
HUGE AMOUNT OF REFUGEES ARE IN 
TURKEY, IN LEBANON, IN JORDAN 
IN THE STATES THAT BORDER, ARE 
ADJACENT TO SYRIA. 
IF WE HELP THEM, THE PRESSURE 
UPON THE EUROPEAN STATES WILL 
DROP, WILL BE DECREASED MANY 
FOLD AND I BELIEVE IT'S CRUCIAL 
FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW FROM A 
HUMANITARIAN POINT OF VIEW, 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF 
HELPING PEOPLE, HELPING 
REFUGEES AND IN GENERAL, I 
AGREE, ICON CONFER WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP OUR MILITARY IS 
QUITE SUCCESSFUL TOGETHER. 
THEY DO GET ALONG AND I HOPE 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN 
THE FUTURE. 
WE WILL KEEP WORKING IN THE 
FORMAT OF RUSSIA, TURKEY AND 
IRAN WHICH I INFORMED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ABOUT. 
BUT WE DO SEND READY TO LINK 
THE EFFORTS TO THE SO-CALLED 
SMALL GROUP OF STATES SO THAT 
THE PROCESS WOULD BE A BROADER 
ONE, A MULTI DIMENSIONAL ONE. 
AND SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
MAXIMIZE OUR FIGHTING CHANCE TO 
GET THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS IN THE 
ISSUE OF SYRIA. 
AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE HAVING 
THE CORD IN SYRIA, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS JUST MENTIONED THAT 
WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED 
THE WORLD FOOTBALL CUP OF THE 
SPEAKING OF FOOTBALL MR. 
PRESIDENT I GIVE THIS BALL TO 
YOU AND NOTCH THE BALL IS IN 
YOUR COURT. 
ALL THE MORE THAT THE UNITED 
STATES WILL HOST THE WORLD CUP 
IN 2026. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
WE DO HOST IT AND WE HOPE WE DO 
AS GOOD A JOB. 
THAT'S VERY NICE. 
THAT WILL GO TO MY SON BEARON. 
WE HAVE NO QUESTION. 
IN FACT MELANIA, HERE YOU GO. 
 
>> FINAL QUESTION FOR THE 
UNITED STATES WILL GO TO 
JONATHAN FROM THE AP.
>> THANK YOU. 
QUESTION FOR EACH PRESIDENT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
YOU FIRST. 
JUST NOTCH PRESIDENT PUTIN 
DENIED HAVING ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH THE ELECTION INTERFERENCE 
IN 2016. 
EVERY U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
HAS CONCLUDED THAT RUSSIA DID. 
MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU SIR 
IS WHO DO YOU BELIEVE? 
MY SECOND QUESTION IS WOULD YOU 
NOW WITH THE WHOLE WORLD 
WATCHING TELL PRESIDENT PUTIN 
YOU DENOUNCE WHAT HAPPENED IN 
2016 OR WARN HIM TO NEVER DO IT 
AGAIN. 
>> LET ME JUST SAY WE HAVE TWO 
THOUGHTS TWO GROUPS WONDERING 
WHY THE F.B.I. 
HAVEN'T TAKEN THE SERVER. 
WHY WAS THE F.B.I. 
TOLD TO LEAVE THE OFFICE OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. 
I'VE BEEN WONDERING THAT AND 
ASKING THAT FOR MONTHS AND 
MONTHS AND I'VE BEEN TWEETING 
IT OUT AND CALLING IT OUT ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA. 
WHERE IS THE SERVER I WANT TO 
KNOW AND WHAT IS THE SERVER 
SAYING? 
WITH THAT BEING SAID ALL I CAN 
DO IS ASK THE QUESTION. 
MY PEOPLE CAME TO ME. 
DAN COATS SAME TO ME AND OTHERS 
SAID THEY THINK IT'S RUSSIA. 
I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN WHO JUST 
SAID IT'S NOT RUSSIA. 
I WILL SAY THIS, I DON'T SEE 
ANY REASON WHY IT WOULD BE BUT 
I REALLY DO WANT TO SEEP THE 
SERVE SERVER. 
BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN BOTH 
PARTIES. 
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL 
PROBABLY GO ON FOR A WHILE BUT 
I DON'T THINK IT CAN GO ON 
WITHOUT FINDING OUT WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THE SERVER? 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SERVERS OF 
THE PAKISTANI GENTLEMAN WHO 
WORKED ON THE DNC. 
WHERE ARE THEY? 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HILARY 
CLINTON'S E-MAILS? 
33,000 E-MAILS GONE, JUST GONE. 
I THINK IN RUSSIA THEY WOULDN'T 
BE GONE SO EASILY. 
I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE THAT WE 
CAN'T GET HILARY CLINTON'S 
33,000 E-MAILS. 
I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN MY 
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE BUT I WILL 
TELL YOU THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN 
WAS EXTREMELY STRONG AND 
POWERFUL IN HIS DENIAL TODAY 
AND WHAT HE DID IS AN 
INCREDIBLE OFFER. 
HE OFFERED TO HAVE THE PEOPLE 
WORKING ON THE CASE COME AND 
WORK WITH THEIR INVESTIGATORS 
WITH RESPECT TO THE 12 PEOPLE. 
I THINK THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE 
OFFER. 
OKAY? 
THANK YOU. 
>> I'D LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING TO 
THIS. 
AFTER ALL I WAS AN INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICER MYSELF. 
AND I DO KNOW HOW IT'S MADE UP. 
JUST A SECOND. 
JUST THE FIRST THING NOT THE 
SECOND THING I BELIEVE THAT 
RUSSIA IS A DEMOCRATIC STATE 
AND I HOPE YOU ARE NOT DENYING 
THIS RIGHT TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY. 
YOU ARE NOT DENYING THAT THE 
UNITED STATES IS A DEMOCRACY. 
DO YOU BELIEVE THE UNITED 
STATES IS A DEMOCRACY? 
AND IF SO, IF IT IS A 
DEMOCRATIC STATE THEN IT THE 
FINAL CONCLUSION AND THIS KIND 
OF A DISPUTE CAN ONLY BE 
DELIVERED BY A TRIAL BY THE 
COURT. 
NOT BY THE EXECUTIVE BY THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
FOR INSTANCE, THE CONCORD 
COMPANY THAT WAS BROUGHT IS 
BEING ACCUSED, IT'S BEING 
ACCUSED OF INTERFERENCE BUT 
THIS COMPANY DOES NOT REPRESENT 
THE RUSSIAN STATE AND I BROUGHT 
SEVERAL EXAMPLES BEFORE. 
WELL YOU HAVE A LOT OF 
INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED 
STATES TAKE GEORGE SUAREZ FOR 
INSTANCE WITH MULTI BILLION 
CAPITALS BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE 
HIM--HIS POSTURE, THE POSTURE 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
NO, IT DOES NOT. 
IT'S THE SAME CASE. 
MR. IS BISHOP TRYING THE CASE 
IN THE COURT AND THE FINAL SAY 
IS FOR THE COURT TO DELIVER. 
WE ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT THE 
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND NOT 
ABOUT PARTICULAR STATES AND AS 
FAR AS THE MOST RECENT 
ALLEGATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS WE DO HAVE A 
GOVERNMENTAL TREATY. 
PLEASE DO SEND US THE REQUEST. 
WE WILL ANALYZE IT PROPERLY AND 
WE'LL SEND A FORMAL RESPONSE 
AND AS I SAID WE CAN EXTEND 
THIS CORPORATION BUT WE SHOULD 
DO IT ON A RECIPROCAL BASIS 
BECAUSE PROVIDING US ACCESS TO 
THE PERSONS OF INTEREST FOR US 
WHO WE BELIEVE CAN HAVE 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 
INTELLIGENCE. 
LET'S DISCUSS THE SPECIFIC 
ISSUES AND NOT USE THE RUSSIA 
AND U.S. RELATIONSHIP AS LOOSE 
CHANGE FOR THE INTERNAL 
POLITICAL STRUGGLE. 
>> A QUESTION FOR PRESIDENT 
PUTIN. 
THANK YOU. 
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU, SIR. 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP MAY HAVE INDICATED TO YOU 
ABOUT OFFICIALY PROSING CRIMA 
AS PART OF RUSSIA AND SECONDLY, 
SIR, DOES THE RUSSIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAVE COMPROMISING 
MATERIAL ON PRESIDENT TRUMP OR 
HIS FAMILY? 
 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CRIMEA 
IS WELL KNOWN AND EXTENSIVE, 
FIRMLY WHY LEA CONTINUED TO 
MAINTAIN THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL TO-
-OUR VIEW POINT IS DIFFERENT. 
WE HELD A REFERENDUM IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UN CHARTER 
AND NATIONAL LEGISLATION. 
FOR US WE PUT PACE TO THIS 
ISSUE. 
AND NOW TO THE COMPROMISING 
MATERIAL. 
YEAH I DID HEAR THE RUMORS THAT 
WE ALLEGEDLY COLLECTED 
COMPROMISING MATERIAL AND MR. 
TRUMP WHEN HE WAS VISITING MOSS 
CORPS. 
A DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE LET 
ME TELL YOU THIS. 
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN 
MOSCOW I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. 
I TREATED PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH 
UTMOST RESPECT BUT BACK THEN 
WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE 
INDIVIDUAL, A BUSINESSMAN 
NOBODY INFORMED ME HE WAS IN 
MOSCOW. 
LET'S TAKE A PRESIDENTIAL 
CONFIRM THERE WERE 500 AMERICAN 
BUSINESS MEN THE HIGH LEVEL 
ONES I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE 
LAST NAMES OF EACH AND EVERY 
ONE OF THEM. 
DO YOU THINK WE TRIED TO 
COLLECT COMPROMISING MATERIAL 
FROM EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM? 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE NOT 
IN NONSENSE OF A BIGGER SCALE 
THAT BE THIS. 
WELL PLEASE JUST DISREGARD 
THESE EASTBOUNDS AND DON'T 
THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE AGAIN. 
>> AND I HAVE TO SAY IF THEY 
HAD IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT 
LONG AGO AND IF ANYBODY WATCHED 
PETER STRUCK TESTIFY OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE DAYS AND I WAS IN 
BRUSSELS WATCHING IT IT WAS A 
DISGRACE TO THE F.B.I., IT WAS 
A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY AND 
YOU WOULD SAY THAT'S A TOTAL 
WITCH HUNT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
>>>  WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT A 
HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
PUTIN IN WHICH THE UNITED 
STATES PRESIDENT WAS ASKED 
REPEATEDLY TO DENOUNCE RUSSIA'S 
ACTIONS IN THE 2016 ELECTION 
AND THE ACTIONS RUSSIA IS 
CURRENTLY CARRYING OUT 
ACCORDING TO OUR OWN U.S. 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. 
HE CHOSE TO ATTACK HIS OWN 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
AND CONTINUE TO RAISE CLAIMS 
HE'S MADE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 
MAJOR GARRETT IS OUR CHIEF 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT ALSO 
HERE. 
MAJOR WHERE SHOULD WE START? 
>> WELL WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
HE HAS CONFIDENCE IN 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND SAYS 
RUSSIA DENIES MEDDLING IN THE 
2016 ELECTION AND I WONDER WHY 
IT WON MEDDLING IN THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
THOSE ANSWERS IN NO WAY LINE UP 
WITH ONE ANOTHER. 
YOU CANNOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 
WHO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION 
UNIFORMLY AND SAY RUSSIA DENIES 
IT. 
THEY ARE UTTERLY INCOMPATIBLE 
AND THIS WAS AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP KNEW IT GOING IN HIS BEST 
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY TO RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 
THE WORLD I DENOUNCE YOU AND 
DON'T DO IT AGAIN. 
GIVEN THAT GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY 
YOU LET IT PASS. 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
I MEAN ONE OF THE WAYS I LOOKED 
AT THIS SUMMIT COMING INTO IT 
IS WONDERING WHETHER THERE 
WOULD BE A CONFRONTATION AND 
AFTER WATCHING ALL OF THIS IT 
SEEMS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A CON 
FILLATION BETWEEN THESE TWO 
LEADERS. 
THEY WERE CHUMMY AS IF THEY 
WERE ALLIES THE WAY THEY TALKED 
ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AND THE WAY 
THEY WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD IN 
THE FUTURE. 
>> AND ONE THING THAT IS WORTH 
POINTING OUT THIS WAS A PRESS 
CONFERENCE OUTSIDE OF THE ISSUE 
OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE 2016 
ELECTION AND WHAT HAS ALREADY 
BEEN ALLEGED ABOUT 2018 THIS 
WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE OF 
MATTEDS ABOUT FUTURE 
COOPERATION AND NOTHING 
MEANINGFUL ABOUT ANY HOT BUTTON 
FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE FOR EITHER 
COUNTRY. 
NO CONCESSINS FROM THE 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT OBAMA THE 
BALTIC STATES OR CRIMEA. 
NO CONCESSIONS ON SYRIA AND 
VAGUE OFFERING TO ASSIST IN 
CONFLICT. 
BUT THOSE EUROPEAN ALLIES WHO 
WERE AFRAID MIGHT DRIVE A HARD 
BARGAIN AND EXTRACT CONCESSIONS 
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE WAS NO 
EVIDENCE OF THAT WHAT SO EVER. 
THIS REACHED NO DISCERNIBLE 
RESOLUTION AND THE TWO NATIONS 
LEAVE ESSENTIALLY WHERE THEY 
ENTER, MORE DIALOGUE BUT NO NEW 
MOVEMENT IN EITHER DIRECTION. 
>> ALL RIGHT MAJOR GARRETT 
HERE. 
I WANT TO SEND IT BACK NOW TO 
GAYLE AND JOHN IN NEW YORK. 
JOHN? 
>> ALL RIGHT NORAH, THANK YOU. 
THAT WAS APP PRODUCT NATURE 
PRESS CONFERENCE. 
FIRST IT STRUCK ME YESTERDAY 
THE U.S. EMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA 
SAID THE POINT OF THIS MEETING 
WOULD BE TO HOLD THE RUSSIANS 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY WERE 
DOING AND WHAT THEY DOING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED AND HE 
SAID WE'VE ALL DONE SOMETHING 
WRONG. 
>> HE'S PUT THIS MORAL IVE 
LENSES HERE BETWEEN THE U.S. 
AND RUSSIA IN TERMS OF PAST BAD 
BEHAVIOR BY THE UNITED STATES 
AND SAYING THAT'S EQUIVALENT 
SOMEHOW TO THIS ON GOING 
INTERFERENCE WE ARE SEEING WITH 
OUR ELECTIONS. 
THAT IS STUNNING AS MAJOR 
GARRETT JUST POINTED OUT THERE 
THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE ISSUE OF 
SUBSTANCE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES LAID OUT HERE. 
HE JUST SPOKE ABOUT HIMSELF A 
DEFENSE OF HIS OWN ELECTION AND 
SEEMED TO BE CHARACTERIZING ALL 
OF THIS THURSDAY THE MUELLER 
PROBE, ALL OF THAT AS AN 
INVESTIGATION AS TO WHETHER OR 
NOT HE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT WHEN 
WE KNOW AS MATTER OF FACT THAT 
THE INVESTIGATION BEGAN BEFORE 
HE ACTUALLY WAS ELECTED AND IS 
BASED IN INTELLIGENCE. 
HE USED HIS PLATFORM TO ATTACK 
HIS OWN F.B.I. 
TO DISMISS OR DWI CUT THE 
CONSENSUS VIEW OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THAT THIS 
WAS ELECTION MEDDLING AND A 
THREAT HERE. 
I MEAN THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE 
ON SYRIA. 
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ON I 
CRAIN. 
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ON ANY 
OF THE THINGS THAT THE U.S. AND 
RUSSIA SHOULD BE WORKING ON. 
THIS WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SPEAKING ABOUT HIMSELF. 
>> WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND 
TO YOUR OWN INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY WHEN YOU ARE ON THE 
WORLD STAGE AND THAT IS YOUR 
ASSESSMENT OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> I WAS MESSAGING AND I GOT 
I'M TURNING OFF THE TELEVISION 
AS A RESPONSE. 
PEOPLE ARE--IT'S A PUNCH IN THE 
GUT. 
BUT THERE ARE FROM SPEAKING 
WITH OTHER OFFICIALS WHO 
CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION WE WERE TALKING 
EARLIER BEDROOM PEOPLE WHO ARE 
HARD MIND OR HARD BRIEFED WITH 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AROUND THE 
WORLD AND THERE'S THE FEAR OF 
WHAT IF I LEAVE? 
WHAT HAPPENS THEN? 
WHAT WILL FILL MY PLACE TO 
SPEAK THE TRUTH HERE BUT YOU 
HEARD THE PRESIDENT REJECTING 
FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED 
TO HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN. 
AND RESITING CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES. 
THERE WAS REFERENCE TO PAKISTAN 
AND OTHER THINGS. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS ASKED ABOUT 
IF DONALD TRUMP WANTED HIM TO 
WIN. 
HE SAID YES I DID BECAUSE HE 
WANTED TO WORK TOGETHER AND TO 
COOPERATE AND GOING BACK TO 
THOSE OF HIS ADVISORS EVEN 
THOUSANDS HARD LINERS IT DOES 
PUT THEM IN A TOUGH POSITION 
BECAUSE HOW DOPPLER THEY GIVE 
INTERVIEWS DEFENDING WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID TODAY. 
WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE DOES THIS 
PUT ON CONGRESS NOW BECAUSE 
GIVEN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO NEED FOR 
SANCTIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO 
BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS DID 
INTERFERE WITH THE U.S. 
ELECTIONS. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN COULDN'T HAVE 
DREAMED OF A BETTER OUTCOME 
FROM THIS SUMMIT. 
HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TREATED HIM 
PUTTING HIM ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE SIDE BY 
SIDE WITH THE UNITED STATES 
NEVER MIND YOU CAN'T COMPARE 
THE TWO ECONOMICALLY. 
YOU COULD COMPARE THE TWO FROM 
A NUCLEAR STANDPOINT BUT THE 
ONLY ISSUE THERE WAS ANY SORT 
OF DISAGREEMENTS ON WAS OVER 
IRAN. 
THE JC POA. 
THAT WAS ONE LINE HE OFFERED ON 
THAT FRONT BUT WHEN IT CAME TO 
INTERFERING IN U.S. ELECTIONS 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT BY JONATHAN 
AT SMART FASHION WAS ASKED WHO 
DO YOU BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY OR VLADIMIR PUTIN DAN 
COATS SAID IT MAY BE THE 
RUSSIANS AND VLADIMIR PUTIN 
SAYS IT'S NOT SO I DON'T SEE 
ANY REASON WHY THEY WOULD HAVE 
DONE IT. 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO GIVE 
HIS ANSWER AND IT'S NOT WHAT 
ANYBODY EXPECTED. 
>> THERE'S BLAME FOR BOTH 
SIDES. 
>> EXACTLY. 
EMBASSADOR BILL BURNS WAS HERE 
EARLIER SAYING OUR PRESIDENT IS 
NOT TETHERED TO HISTORY. 
HE ALWAYS BLAMES HIS 
PREDECESSORS. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN CANCERTAINLY 
SHARE THE BLAME TOO. 
HE HASN'T ALWAYS EXTENDED 
HIMSELF TO THE U.S. BUT HE 
SOUNDED LIKE THIS WAS A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
>> AND TO HAVE THE ADD JACEETY 
TO SAY WE WILL WORK WITH THE 
AMERICANS. 
I'M GOING TO SEND MY TEAM. 
IT'S JUST MIND BLOWING. 
>> THE NORMAL ALSO HAS BEEN FOR 
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN AN 
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION TO 
STAND UP FOR THE COUNTRY TO SAY 
WE ARE ALL TO BLAME IS OUTSIDE 
OF THE NORMAL OF USUALLY WHEN 
PRESIDENTS DO IN THIS INSTANCE. 
LET'S GO BACK TO NORAH 
O'DONNELL WHO HAS SOME OF THE 
RUSSIAN REACTION. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE 
BEST AND WORST CASE SCENARIOS 
THAT COULD COME OUT OF THE 
SUMMIT AND PUTIN IS LEAVING 
WITH ONE OF THE BEST CASE 
SCENARIOS BECAUSE FOLLOWING 
EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IN 
QUARTER AND THEY ARE DECLARING 
IT A SUCCESS. 
>> VICTORY. 
WE HAVE IT VERY CLEARLY FROM 
THE MOUTH OF RUSSIA'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER ASKED BY THE ONLINE 
MAGAZINE LIFE IN RUSSIA HOW THE 
TALKS HAD GONE AND HE SAID THEY 
WERE BETTER THAN SUPER. 
IN FACT THEY WERE FABULOUS. 
SO ALREADY DECLARING A VICTORY 
THERE. 
>> THE RUSSIANS ARE LEAVING 
VERY HAPPY. 
>> THERE YOU GUYS HEAR IT AND I 
DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAY THE 
COMMENTS THE FORMER CIA 
DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN WHO HAS 
BEEN A FIERCE CRITIC HAS 
TWEETED CALLING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S PRESS CONFERENCE 
PERFORMANCE TREASONOUS STAYING 
IT EXCEEDS THE HIGH CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS AND HE IS WHOLLY 
IN THE POCKET OF PUTIN FROM THE 
FORMER CIA DIRECTOR OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
JOHN, GAYLE, MARGARET? 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH NORAH. 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR 
WHAT HIS REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES 
WILL HAVE TO SAY. 
>> THE STANDARD IS LET'S LEAVE 
THE QUESTION OF COLLUSION 
ASIDE. 
THE ANALYSIS IS WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT OBAMA THE WORLD STAGE 
IS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS MET THE 
NORMAL STANDARD OF WHAT A 
PRESIDENT DOES AND SPEAKING ON 
BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
AND THE COUNTRY AND HE WAS--THE 
PRESIDENT IS VERY FOCUSED ON 
HIS ELECTION AND THE CRITICISM 
WILL BE ABOUT WHETHER HE MET 
THE STANDARD OF WHAT A 
PRESIDENT SPEAKING FOR THE 
WHOLE NATION WHEN IT HAS 
ACCORDING TO HIS DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN 
ATTACKED AND IS CURRENTLY 
CNFER AATTACK AGAINST VLADIMIR 
PUTIN ON THAT INVESTIGATION. 
>> WE HEARD A LOT OF CRITICISM 
OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WHERE HE 
WENT ABROAD AND APOLOGIZED FOR 
AMERICAN HISTORY PARTS THAT 
WERE PAINFUL. 
WITH THIS PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW 
EVEN JUST IN STATEMENTS THAT 
YOU ARE SEEING FROM STEVE 
SCALISE, VERY IMPORTANT 
REPUBLICAN IN TERMS OF BEING 
VOTES IN WASHINGTON PUTTING OUT 
TWEETS SAYING LOOK NO ONE 
CRITICIZED OBAMA FOR A MEETING 
WITH THE PRESIDENT BEFORE THIS 
IN THE SAME WAY AND SAYING I 
CAN BE MORE FLEXIBLE. 
HILARY CLINTON TRIED TO RESET. 
THE CRITICISM HERE THAT IS 
BEING OFFERED BY INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICIALS IS NOT REACHING OUT 
TO RUSSIA. 
TAKE THE BEATING AND BE TOUGH. 
THE PRESIDENT APPEARED MERE TO 
BE ALMOST APOLOGETIC ON BEHALF 
OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
úSTEPP 
HIM AT ONE POINT WHICH IS 
REALLY UNUSUAL. 
>> SEEMED TO GRASP VLADIMIR 
PUTIN'S IDEA TO WORK WITH THE 
UNITED STATES AND COOPERATE ON 
FINDING OUT WHO THESE 12 
ALLEGED MEN WERE WHICH WAS 
STUNNING GIVEN THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP RESPONDED BY SAYING I 
THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. 
REALLY INTERESTING. 
>> THIS IS THE SLIGHT OF HAND 
THAT WE'VE OFFERED BEFORE 
SAYING OKAY FINE. 
>> BUT IF YOU COMPARE THE 
DEMEANOR WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND THIS 
MEETING COMPARED TO HOW HE WAS 
WITH THERESA MAY IT'S LIKE TWO 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE. 
>> THAT'S TRUE AND ONE THING 
THAT'S I AM POLICEIT IN THE 
PRESIDENT BUYING PRESIDENT 
PUTIN'S IDEA OF THE IDEA HE HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. 
HE ISN'T JUST TAKING HIM AT HIS 
WORD HE'S AND WHAT PUTIN HAS 
SAID. 
>> FORMER AGENT SELF IDENTIFIED 
WITH THAT TOO. 
>> RUSSIA CAN STAY WAS A 
SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT, A FABULOUS, 
WHATEVER THE WORD THAT WAS USED 
IN THE UNITED STATES. 
YOU HAVE FORMER INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICIALS SAYING THIS IS 
BORDERING ON TREASON. 
VERY DIFFERENT REACTION ON BOTH 
SIDES. 
>> A LOT STILL TO SORT OUT AND 
WE THANK NORAH OVER THERE AND 
SHE'LL KEEP WORKING. 
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A FULL WRAP 
UP OF THE SUMMIT TONIGHT ON THE 
CBS EVENING NEWS WITH JEFF 
GLOR. 
>> AND OUR SUMMIT COX WILL 
CONTINUE ON YOUR LOCAL NEWS ON

HOUR STREAMING NETWORK CBSN.
