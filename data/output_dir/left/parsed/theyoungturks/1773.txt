THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER CELEBRATES
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF
THE PRESS, AND IT IS GETTING
SOME BAD PRESS FOR A FREE SPEECH
PERFORMED BY MICHELLE WOLF.
NOW,
A LOT OF JOURNALISTS THAT WERE
PRESENT AT THE DINNER THINK THAT
SHE WENT TOO FAR, AND SOME OF
HER BOLDEST JOKES HAD TO DO WITH
ABORTION, SHE SAID --
>>
>>OKAY.
ALSO SHE TOOK AIM AT
KELLYANNE CONWAY, SAYING --
>>
>>
>>
>> THIS TIME DON'T BE SUCH A
LITTLE BITCH, JIM ACOSTA.
>>I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SARAH.
I THINK SHE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL.
LIKE, SHE BURNS FACTS AND THEN
SHE USES THAT ASH TO 
CREATE A
PERFECT SMOKY EYE.
LIKE, MAYBE
SHE'S BORED WITH IT, MAYBE IT'S
LIES.
IT'S PROBABLY LIES.
AND
I'M NEVER REALLY SURE WHAT TO
CALL SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, YOU
KNOW WHAT LOVE ISN'T SARAH
SANDERS, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS,
COUSIN HUCKABEE, AUNTIE HUCKABEE
SANDERS.
LIKE, WHAT'S UNCLE TOM
BUT FOR WHITE WOMEN WHO
DISAPPOINT OTHER WHITE WOMEN?
OH, I KNOW.
AUNT COULTER.
>> SO THAT WAS A LITTLE SCATHING
TO SAY THE LEAST, MANY ARE UPSET
THAT SHE WENT AFTER SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS' LOOKS, SHE
WENT AFTER THE COMMENTS ABOUT
HER BEING A SOFTBALL COACH, AUNT
LYDIA FROM THE HANDMAIDS TALE,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET
ABOUT SMOKY EYE COMMENT, EVEN
TOMI LAHREN SAID IT WAS AWFUL
SHE TOOK AIM AT A WOMAN THAT
WAY, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
ACTUALLY A FEMINIST, APPARENTLY
IS, BUT SARAH'S DAD WAS THE MOST
UPSET AT THIS COMMENTARY.
HE
SAID --
>>
>> ESSENTIALLY HE'S 
EQUATING
WHAT MICHELLE WOLF HAD TO SAY
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER WITH HATE
SPEECH, WHICH IS A FALSE
EQUIVALENT THERE.
HE ALSO SAID
--
>>
>>IT'S ABSURD AND SEXIST WHY HE
SAYS YOUNG FEMALE BUT THAT'S
BESIDE THE POINT --
>>
>> GO FOR IT.
>>IS THAT A P.C.
WAY OF SAYING
KILL YOURSELF?
BECAUSE PRIDE
PODS ARE DANGEROUS.
>> I THINK WHAT HE'S SAYING IS
WASH OUT YOUR MOUTH BECAUSE IT'S
VULGAR.
BUT THE INTERESTING PART
ABOUT THIS IS THAT HE'S SO
AGAINST THIS VERBAL BULLYING,
ESPECIALLY AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER
WHO WAS A WOMAN.
AND IT'S LIKE,
OKAY, BUT YOU ARE DEFENDING
DONALD TRUMP WHO VERBALLY
BELIEVES WOMEN ON A DAILY BASIS.
HE CALLS THEM PIGS, DOGS, SAYS
THEY HAVE BLOOD COMING OUT OF
WHATEVER -- I'M NOT SAYING
EITHER ARE RIGHT BUT IT'S ONE OF
THE OTHER, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
AND THIS COMES RIGHT AFTER HE
REALLY STOOD UP AGAINST P.C.
CULTURE.
HE SAID PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T WATCH HIS SHOW IF YOU
ARE EASILY OFFENDED, AND WARNED
THEM NOT TO TUNE IN BECAUSE THEY
WILL GET TRIGGERED AND NEED A
PONY, POPSICLE, AND PLAY-DOH TO
COPE.
SO WHAT HE SAYS IS OKAY,
BUT WHATEVER A COMEDIAN SAYS
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ABOUT HIS
ADMINISTRATION, IS NOT OKAY.
>>A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT A
PROBLEM UNLESS IT AFFECTS YOU,
SO I GUESS THAT'S THE
PUNISHMENT, IF THAT'S HOW YOU
HANDLE SOMETHING THAT TRIGGERS
YOU THEN DON'T WATCH IT, IT
SEEMS PRETTY EASY TO NOT WATCH
IT. IS IT FREE-SPEECH OR IS IT
FREE SPEECH, IS WHAT IT COMES
DOWN TO.
>> OF COURSE YOU ARE RIGHT.
YOU
CAN'T BE SURPRISED THAT MIKE
HUCKABEE COMES TO THE RESCUE OF
SARAH HUCKABEE, I MEAN, IF YOU
DIDN'T DO THAT I'M SURE HE
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH
HIMSELF.
ON THE OTHER HAND HE'S
A TOTAL HYPOCRITE, HE'S A
HYPOCRITE AND SO MANY OTHER WAYS
BEYOND THIS ONE, BUT YES HE'S
CONSTANTLY MAKING FUN OF LIBERAL
SNOWFLAKES AND HOW WE GET
TRIGGERED BY THINGS, AND THEN OF
COURSE HE'S SUPER TRIGGERED BY
WHAT WENT DOWN AT THE WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER.
AGAIN HIS DEFENSE OF HIS
DAUGHTER I CAN COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND.
>>I HOPE MY DAD WOULD DEFEND ME
IF SOMEONE WENT AFTER ME.
>>I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR DOING
THAT.
>>I FEEL LIKE IF I SHOWED UP TO
PARTICIPATE IN A ROASTED
SOMEONE ROASTED BE I DON'T THINK
MY MOM WOULD FLIP OUT ABOUT IT.
>>MY MOM ROASTS ME, BUT IF
SOMEBODY ROASTED ME SHE WOULD BE
LIKE, THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.
THERE'S THAT DISTINCTION WHEN IT
COMES TO PARENTAL PROTECTION.
>> DO YOU SIGN UP FOR THOUGH BY
SHOWING UP?
>> I THINK IT'S GREAT SHE SHOWED
UP, I THINK IT'S A GOOD SPORT
THAT SHE SHOWED UP.
HERE IS
WHERE I STAND ON THIS, I THINK A
LOT OF MICHELLE WOLF'S JOKES
WERE EDGY.
THEY WERE DEFINITELY
EDGY, SHE PUSHED THE ENVELOPE.
>> WERE ANY OUT OF BOUNDS?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T
PERSONALLY CONDONE ANY SORT OF
JOKES OR SHAMING ABOUT
SOMEBODY'S WEIGHT OR THEIR LOOKS
OR THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK
EVEN WHEN PEOPLE GO AFTER DONALD
TRUMP'S APPEARANCE THAT KIND OF
RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY, BUT YOU
ARE FREE TO DO SO.
>> BUT DID SHE GO AFTER THAT?
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION.
>>I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING
IS THAT SHE DID THAT WITH THE
SOFTBALL AND AUNT LYDIA.
>> IS THAT OUT OF BOUNDS?
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS, I JUST
DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY.
>>IS SHE SAYING SOFTBALL COACHES
ARE UNATTRACTIVE?
I THINK IT'S
MORE A JOKE ON HOW SHE
AGGRESSIVELY YELLS OUT
REPORTERS' NAMES AND DOLES OUT
WHO GETS TO TALK.
>>THAT'S HOW I TOOK IT TOO.
>> BUT THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT
AS SAYING YOU ARE A WOMAN WHO
WAS PUSHING THESE MISOGYNISTIC
POLICIES TO THE PEOPLE, WHICH IS
WHAT AUNT LYDIA DOES ON THE
HANDMAIDS TALE.
>> AND I 
GUESS THE CLAP BACKS
SHE'S GETTING IN RESPONSE TO
THIS HAS TO DO WITH HER SMOKY
EYE COMMENT, RIGHT?
AND SHE
LITERALLY IS COMPLEMENT IN HER
SMOKY EYE.
SARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS HAS GREAT MAKEUP, AND
SHE'S LITERALLY COMPLEMENTING
THAT BUT ALSO SAYING IT'S FROM
ASHES FROM THE BURN FACTS
THAT YOU PRESENT.
>>TO BE FAIR IT'S TOUGH TO PULL
A COMPLEMENT OUT OF THAT LITTLE
RUN.
>> SHE'S CLAIMING IT'S A
COMPLEMENT.
>> I LOVE CLUB COMEDY, EDGY
COMEDY, BUT THIS IDEA THAT IT'S
BECOME A ROAST WHERE YOU CAN
JUST BLOW TORCH EVERYBODY IN THE
ROOM, MAYBE IT'S GONNA LITTLE
TOO FAR.
>> YOU THINK SHE WENT TOO FAR?
>>I DO.
LOOK, FIRST OF ALL I
LOVE HER MATERIAL, I THOUGHT IT
WAS REALLY FUNNY, LAUGH OUT LOUD
FUNNY, BUT IF IT WERE UP TO ME I
WOULD'VE PULLED A LITTLE OF THAT
ABORTION STUFF OUT, I THOUGHT IT
WAS ROUGH.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR
ROOM A LITTLE BIT. AND IF YOU
SAY NO, MARK, THE ROOM IS THE
USA.
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
PLAYING THAT ROOM THERE.
AND
HAVING GENERAL RESPECT FOR
SENSIBILITIES.
BUT DON'T
MISUNDERSTAND ME, I LOVED HER
STUFF, I THOUGHT IT WAS EDGY AND
THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL GET WHEN
YOU HIRE THAT KIND OF COMIC.
BUT
MORE FUNDAMENTALLY THIS WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER IS
CRAP.
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD
IT, I'VE ALWAYS SAID IT, IT'S
WAY TOO COZY, IT'S A CELEBRATION
OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT, IF IT'S
JOURNALISM THEY SHOULD TAKE A
MINUTE AND TALK ABOUT WHERE
JOURNALISM HAS GONE.
THERE ARE A
HANDFUL OF OUTFITS THAT ARE
STILL DOING JOURNALISM, BUT MOST
OF IT IS DOING INTENSE
DISCUSSION SPEECH, LIKE CNN AND
FOX NEWS AND MS AND ALL THE
REST, AND THE REAL INVESTIGATIVE
STUFF IS BEING DONE HERE AT TYT
BUT ALSO IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT
PRINT AREAS ACROSS THE INTERNET.
SO I DON'T SEE THEM AS
JOURNALISTS ANYMORE, I SEE THEM
AS CELEBRITIES WHO ARE ALL GOING
DOWN ON EACH OTHER ON THIS NIGHT
OF THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER.
SO THE
WHOLE THING IS GARBAGE, AND
THEY'VE GOTTEN SO INTO THESE
STUNT BOOKINGS OF COMICS WHO ARE
THEN SO EDGY, AND THEN
AFTERWARDS EVERYBODY IS
CLUTCHING THEIR PEARLS GOING,
WITH JIMMY KIMMEL TOO DIFFICULT
TO TAKE?
WAS STEPHEN COLBERT TOO
IN THE FACE OF GEORGE BUSH?
IT'S
WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU HIRE THAT
KIND OF COMIC.
>> THE ENTIRE NIGHT IS SUPPOSED
TO SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS,
RIGHT?
AND THEN THEY ARE TRYING
TO -- THEY WERE UPSET
ESSENTIALLY BY THIS BECAUSE THEY
ARE STILL TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND
THIS CLOAK OF IMPARTIALITY, AND
THEY AREN'T. AREN'T IMPARTIAL,
THEY AREN'T UNBIASED, THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT THEY ARE STILL
TRYING TO SAY WE ARE A NEUTRAL
JOURNALIST, BUT THEY START TO
GET UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE
THROUGH THEIR REPORTING AND
SENSATIONALISM THEY HAVE
COMPLETELY NORMALIZED SOME OF
THE BEHAVIOR AND THE THINGS
GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND
SHE EVEN CALLED THEM OUT ON
THAT.
SHE SAYS YOU HAVE ENABLED
AND CREATED THIS MONSTER, YOU
ARE PERPETUATING THIS, IT'S YOUR
FAULT.
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO
HEAR THAT, THEY AREN'T SELF
REFLECTIVE, BUT I THINK THAT IS
WHAT THEY ARE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH AND I THINK WHAT THEY DID
IS USE MICHELLE WOLF AS A
SCAPEGOAT.
>> IT WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT CHUMMING UP AND SHOWING
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
SUBJECTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO
COVER THE SUBJECTS, IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A DINNER TO
CELEBRATE THESE JOURNALISTS WHO
DO THE HARD WORK.
AND I THINK
THE REASON THE TIMES, THE NEW
YORK TIMES, THEY DON'T
PARTICIPATE IN THIS ANYMORE
BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME KIND OF
THIS CELEBRATION THAT SHOWS YOU
PARTYING AND CHUMMING UP TO THE
PEOPLE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE.
IS IT
FREE SPEECH OR IS IT FREE
SPEECH?
SO IS THIS GOING TO FAR?
THESE HARD NEWS OPERATIONS HAVE
ALL THESE PAYOLA RULES AND YOU
CAN'T EVEN ACCEPT GIFTS FROM
PEOPLE YOU COVER BUT THEN YOU
HAVE A MASSIVE NBC PARTY THAT
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS AT
AFTER THIS WHEN SHE WAS SO
UPSET.
IS THAT OKAY?
>> BUT THAT'S THE THING, THEY
ARE TRYING TO -- I'VE BEEN TO
THE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER AND
WHAT HAPPENS IS IN THIS ROOM
BEFORE THE DINNER THEY ALL ARE
IN THE SAME ROOM, ALL OF THE
JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS,
THEY ARE ALL SCHMOOZING, BECAUSE
WHAT THESE JOURNALISTS WANT IS
ACCESS.
>> AND IS THAT APPROPRIATE?
>>LOOK, JOURNALISM IN WASHINGTON
DOES INVOLVE CHUMMING AROUND,
AND JOURNALISM IN WASHINGTON
DOES INVOLVE GOING FOR A DRINK
OR DINNER WITH A SOURCE OR MAYBE
EVEN A HIGH-PROFILE POLITICAL
FIGURE.
SO THERE IS CHUMMING
GOING ON ALREADY, WE KNOW THAT,
THAT'S HOW TO GET A SOURCE TO
OPEN UP, THAT'S THE WAY TO GET
AN INSIDE TRACK ON CERTAIN
STORIES.
HAVING SAID THAT, IT'S
GROSSLY PERVERTED IN THIS
PROCESS OF THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER.
IT HAS
BECOME SOME SORT OF OSCARS TYPE
THING WHERE YOU SIT THERE AND
THE NEXT DAY YOU DO THIS
POSTMORTEM ON THE HOST.
FORGET
IT, SCRAP THE HOST, GET BACK TO
JOURNALISM, AND YOU GUYS SHOULD
CELEBRATE REAL JOURNALISTS AND
THE WORK THEY STILL DO, THOSE
WHO ARE STILL DOING IT, AND THEN
IT SHOULD ALL GO TO THE
SCHOLARSHIP FUND OR THOSE THINGS
ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORTING
JOURNALISM AND FREE SPEECH AND
THE MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY.
BUT
WE'VE GOTTEN WAY OFF TRACK WITH
THIS, AS I SAY COME OF THIS
CELEBRATION OF EACH OTHER, IT'S
A SELF-CONGRATULATORY LOAD OF
CRAP.
