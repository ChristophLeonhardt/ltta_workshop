June 2015
Vatican City

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,980
Pope Francis releases a landmark encyclical
on the threat of human-caused climate change.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,980
It’s the first time the Catholic Church
has endorsed the science behind global warming.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,980
He warns that a lack of environmental action
will have “serious consequences for all

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,980
of us.”

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,980
The encyclical criticizes world leaders for
failing to take action.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,980
It’s hoped the Pope’s message will inspire
a “bold cultural revolution” on how we

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,980
treat the Earth.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,980
“Human beings, while capable of the worst,
are also capable of rising above themselves,

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:00,000
choosing again what is good, and making a
new start...”
