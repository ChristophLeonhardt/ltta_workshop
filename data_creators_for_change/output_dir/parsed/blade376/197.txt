tree of insight tears distilled by the
sunshine of a new day light and warmth
from my face eliminates unjust pain I
prayed for deliverance and you took away
the rain now I reach for your hand
please allow me to stay sane here comes
the fire torching fields I leave behind
I breathe in floating ashes with great
hope and desire to find a lesson I can
take with me so I no longer have to hide
on wood I marched the horizon more
experienced and refined suddenly I feel
a cool breeze that causes me to turn
reveal to me our fresh fields in place
of all that was burned a tree stands
there alone my own loneliness it
confirms now sitting with i watch
Destiny's natural course take away my
remaining concerns 60 seconds September
