EMERGED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO
BOARD MARINE ONE.
>> President Trump: WE ARE
GOING TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT
SPEECH AND MEETING AND HE WILL
BE FLYING.
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING WITH
HIM.
THAT WILL BE VERY NICE.
WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING.
WE'LL BE TALKING ON THE PLANE.
I ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP OTHER THAN THERE
HAS BEEN NO COLLUSION, FOLKS,
NO COLLUSION.
AND -- BUT I HAVE A VERY GOOD
RELATIONSHIP.
WE'LL SEE.
I DON'T HEAR YOU.
>> President Trump: NO, I DON'T.
>> President Trump: I THOUGHT
THE WAY THEY BEHAVED WAS AWFUL.
TO THE STATEMENTS THEY MADE, TO
WATCHING BLUMENTHAL, A
FRAUDSTER WHEN IT CAME TO
VIETNAM AND WHAT HE DID WAS
HORRIBLE.
I THOUGHT THAT THE WAY THEY
CONDUCTED THEMSELVES, THE WAY
THEY DEALT WITH A HIGH-LEVEL,
BRILLIANT GOING TO BE A GREAT
JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT.
THE WAY THEY TORTURED HIM AND
HIS FAMILY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DISGRACE.
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
DISGRACEFUL PERFORMANCES I'VE
EVER SEEN.
>> President Trump: SO I'VE
BEEN HEARING THAT, NOW THEY'RE
THINKING ABOUT IMPEACHING A
BRILLIANT JURIST, A MAN THAT
DID NOTHING WRONG, A MAN THAT
WAS CAUGHT UP IN A HOAX THAT
WAS SET UP BY THE DEMOCRATS
USING THE DEMOCRATS' LAWYERS.
AND NOW THEY WANT TO IMPEACH
HIM.
I'VE HEARD THIS FROM MANY
PEOPLE.
I THINK IT'S AN INSULT TO THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF
THINGS HAPPEN ON NOVEMBER 6th
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED
BEFORE.
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS SEEN
THIS CHARADE AND DISHONESTY BY
THE DEMOCRATS.
WHEN YOU MENTION IMPEACH A
JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT WHO WAS A TOP
SCHOLAR, TOP STUDENT, TOP
INTELLECT AND WHO DID NOTHING
WRONG AND THERE WAS NO
CORROBORATION OF ANY KIND AND
WENT THROUGH SEVEN F.B.I.
INVESTIGATIONS, HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF.
I MEAN, YOU HAD -- THE LAST ONE.
LOOK AT THE LAST ONE.
THE THINGS THEY SAID ABOUT HIM.
I DON'T EVEN THINK HE EVER
HEARD OF THE WORD.
IT WAS ALL MADE UP.
IT WAS FABRICATED AND IT IS A
DISGRACE.
I THINK IT WILL REALLY SHOW YOU
SOMETHING COME NOVEMBER 6th.
>> President Trump: I DON'T
HEAR YOU, WHAT?
>> President Trump: I THINK A
LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO
VOTE REPUBLICAN BECAUSE I HAVE
MANY FRIENDS THAT ARE DEMOCRATS.
THE MAIN BASE OF THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE SHIFTED SO FAR LEFT THAT
WE'LL END UP BEING VENEZUELA.
THIS COUNTRY WOULD END UP BEING
VENEZUELA.
I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE
GOING TO BE VOTING REPUBLICAN
ON NOVEMBER 6.
>> President Trump: VERY WELL
DOCUMENTED.
IT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED FOR MANY
YEARS VERY WELL.
ALL PUBLIC DOCUMENTS.
SAY IT?
>> President Trump: I DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE --
I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU
SAID.
NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL.
