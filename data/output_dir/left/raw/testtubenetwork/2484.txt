1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,680
Ukraine is being accused by human rights groups
of using cluster bombs during their ongoing

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,000
conflict with pro-Russian separatists. They
deny using these weapons, but the accusation alone

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,490
bring up an interesting question. What weapons
aren’t you allowed to use in war? There are

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,210
numerous conventions that prohibit certain
weapons in war. Mainly, weapons that are seen as

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,510
having uncontrollable effects or causing unjustifiable
suffering.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,630
The main treaty governing this is called the
Certain Conventional Weapons Convention

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,280
or CCW. It prohibits the use of Laser weapons
designed to blind people and non-detectable

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,900
fragment weapons. Both of these are prohibited
because they cause unjustifiable suffering.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,640
Non-detectable fragment weapons produce shrapnel
that can not be detected using an X-ray

10
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,749
machine, making it very difficult for Doctors
to treat the injured.

11
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,699
The Protocols of the CCW

12
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,959
also prohibit some weapons because they have
an uncontrollable effect. Namely, Incendiary

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,520
weapons, Land mines, booby traps, and other
weapons that can be detonated by remote or

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:06,120
timer. All of these weapons are deemed uncontrollable.
And some of them, like landmines for

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,360
example, last long past the conflict, and
have been known to maim or kill innocent civilians

16
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,149
during peacetime.

17
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:17,939
In fact, landmines are a large enough problem
that in addition to the CCW there is also

18
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,189
The Ottawa Treaty, which not only bans mines,
but also calls for the destruction of current

19
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,700
mine stockpiles and the prohibition of their
production and transfer. Since the treaty became

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,679
international law in 1999, it’s estimated
that landmine casualties have gone down by

21
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,630
over 60%.

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,520
Then we get to cluster munitions, the same
weapons Ukraine is accused of using. In 2008,

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,210
the Convention on Cluster Munitions was adopted,
prohibiting use, production, transfer and

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,969
stockpiling of cluster bombs. This was enacted
because cluster bombs affect such a wide area

25
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,130
and can’t distinguish “between civilians
and combatants.” Also, like mines, many

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,409
cluster bombs

27
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,840
never detonate; leaving possibly lethal time
bombs long after wars have ended.

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,630
These treaties are far from perfect, and not
all nations have agreed to follow them;

29
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,590
for example, major world powers like the US,
Russia and China are not party to all of these

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,400
agreements. But despite that, countries, including
those we just listed, are allowing

31
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,600
these rules to inform how they conduct war.
And human rights groups and the UN are

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
using these treaties as grounds for condemning
misconduct.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Some of you are probably now wondering about
chemical weapons. We didn’t cover

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,680
those here, because we did an entire video
on just that subject. We’ll play a little bit

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:00:00,000
of that now. Click on the screen at anytime
