DEAL AND HIS TRIP TO NORTH KOREA. CHECK YOUR LOCAL LISTINGS FOR TIME AND CHANNEL. THAT WILL BE AN INTERESTING SHOW. LELAND: CHRIS WALLACE COMING UP IN ABOUT - - MINUTES TO PREVIEW THE INTERVIEW. - - FOCUSES OUR ATTENTION ON OTHER AMERICANS HELD AROUND THE WORLD. ROBERT LEVINSON WORLD. ROBERT LEVINSON SERVED HIS COUNTRY IN THE FBI AND WHILE ON A PRIVATE INVESTIGATION DISAPPEARED IN IRAN MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO. HIS DAUGHTER STEPHANIE CURRY JOINS US FROM DALLAS. APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH I KNOW UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION YOU FELT LIKE YOUR FATHER WAS FORGOTTEN. AND PERHAPS FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM, FIGHTING FOR HIM WAS SACRIFICED FOR THE YEAR WAS SACRIFICED FOR THE DEAR WAS SACRIFICED FOR THE DEAL THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO GO. HAVE THINGS CHANGED UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY. MY FATHER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY LEFT BEHIND BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. AND IT HAS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT WE FEEL PRESIDENT TRUMP AS THE NEGOTIATION SKILLS TO BRING OUR FATHER HOME. AND SECRETARY POMPEO HAS JUST SHOWN THAT BRINGING AMERICANS HAVE BEEN HELD CAPTIVE ABROAD IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO HIM SO WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL. LELAND: YOUR FATHER'S CASE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE HE WAS ABROAD ON AN INVESTIGATOR BUT NOT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE IRANIANS WON'T EVEN SAY THEY HAVE THEM. A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE HE WAS AND HOW AND WHY HE WAS TAKEN ON THAT ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF IRAN. GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MUCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE TWO PIN THIS ON THE IRANIANS. MY FAMILY RECENTLY MET WITH - - OUR IRANIAN LAWYER. HE INFORMED US THAT HE DID FILE MY FATHER'S CASE AS A MISSING PERSON'S CASE IN IRAN PERSON'S CASE IN IRAN, THE CLASSIFICATION WAS CHANGED TO A SECURITY CASE. THE CASE HAS JUST INSTALLED AT THAT POINT THAT WAS MANY YEARS AGO.WE DON'T SEE ANY URGENCY BY IRAN TO RESOLVE MY FATHER'S CASE. MY FATHER'S PASSPORT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. IRAN HAS A MORAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE US INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FATHER AND TO BRING HIM HOME TO US. LELAND: WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU HAVE ABOUT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING NOW? HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANYTHING FROM THEM TO SAY THERE'S BEEN MOVEMENT ON THIS BY THE IRANIANS? WE SPEAK WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ON REGULAR BASIS. BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING ON MOVEMENT, UNFORTUNATELY.WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A THIRD-PARTY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RELATIONS WITH IRAN. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IF THE SUPREME LEADER SAYS SEND BOB LEVINSON HOME, HE CAN BE HOME WAS TOMORROW. IT'S BEEN 11 YEARS TO LEARN. HE'S BEEN HELD FOR 4083 DAYS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND MY FAMILY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS ALLOWED IN MODERN TIMES THAT A MAN CAN BE HELD WITH NO HUMAN RIGHTS. LELAND: WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH FROM THE PRESIDENT ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S CASE OR THE OTHER AMERICANS HELD IN IRAN. THE ADMINISTRATION FOCUSED ON THOSE HELD IN WITH KOREA. HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT THOSE HELD IN IRAN. WHY DO THINK THAT IS? I CAN'T SPECULATE. ALL I AM IS A DAUGHTER WHO WANTS HER FATHER HOME. HE HAS MANY GRANDCHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN BORN SINCE HE'S BEEN IN CAPTIVITY. MY PARENTS 44TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY WAS YESTERDAY AND 11 OF THOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN SPENT IN CAPTIVITY. IT'S JUST UNCONSCIONABLE TO THINK THAT THIS IS ALLOWED. WE'RE JUST A FEELING THAT ONCE OUR FATHER HOME. LELAND: THE EMOTION IS UNDERSTANDABLE. YOUR WORK ON BEHALF OF YOUR FATHER AND YOUR TIRELESS WILLINGNESS TO COME AND TALK ABOUT HIM I THINK SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE FAMILY YOU ALL HAVE. LAST QUESTION FOR YOU. AS THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THEY WERE GOING TO PULL OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WAS THERE A PIT IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR STOMACH THAT SAID THIS WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO BRING THAT HOME OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS COULD BRING MOVEMENT TO THE CASE? TO BE HONEST, THERE'S A PIT IN MY STOMACH EVERY DAY ALONG WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. EVERY DAY HE'S NOT HOME WITH US, IT'S DEVASTATING. WE'D LIKE TO THINK WE ARE HOPEFUL. SECRETARY POMPEO JUST SHOWED HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN THAT POSITION. AND HE HAS MADE AMERICANS ABROAD WHO'VE BEEN HELD IN CAPTIVITY, A PRIORITY. WE ARE HOPEFUL. I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT. WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. OUR FATHER HAS AND WE ARE FIGHTING EVERYTHING TODAY FOR HIM. AND WE HOPE ON THE OTHER END THAT HE IS FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GET HOME TO US. LELAND: SUFFICE TO SAY LELAND: SUFFICE TO SAY, A FATHER'S LOVE KNOWS NO ENDS AND I'M SURE HE KNOWS THE FEELING
