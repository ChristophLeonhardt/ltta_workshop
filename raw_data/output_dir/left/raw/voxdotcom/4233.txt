1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:06,060
One of the bad habits we have in the media
is trying to give each election a narrative,

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,369
as if there is one story going right through
it. Doesn't work. So instead of giving you

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:16,180
one story about it, I'm going to give you
five takeaways that I think -- I think -- are

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,300
true. Number one is that this was just a goddamn
disaster for Democrats. They got destroyed.

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,259
They got destroyed in the states. They got
destroyed in the governors' races. They lost

6
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:33,829
in Maryland, in Massachusetts, in Maine. This
was a wholesale rejection of the Democratic

7
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,949
party. This was a Republican wave. But takaway
number two is that liberalism actually did

8
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:43,370
a whole lot better than Democrats did. Across
the country, you had ballot initiatives that

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,620
were pretty damn liberal. A couple of them
were liberal enough that you couldn't even

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,850
have imagined them being serious contenders
a decade ago. In Washington, DC and Oregon

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,440
they legalized marijuana. They increased the
minimum wage in Illinois and Nebraska and

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,829
Arkansas. They expanded background checks
on guns in Washington state. A lot of these

13
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,420
ballot initiatives were in states where Republicans
won the election, which suggests voters are

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,229
very angry at the Democratic party, but they
don't necessarily agree with the Republican

15
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:16,600
party on very much. Takeaway number three
is that Democrats, as every party does every

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,100
time they win an election, had told themselves
a bunch of stories that just turned out to

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,170
be bullshit. They thought that there was a
whole new electorate that had emerged, and

18
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,890
that pollsters simply weren't counting the
rush of Latino voters and young women who

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,079
would be coming to the polls. And they're
right about one thing, the polls were wrong.

20
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,450
But they weren't wrong because they underestimated
Democratic strength. They were wrong because

21
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,810
the underestimated Republican strength. Takeaway
number 4: There are actually a couple 2016

22
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,539
winners in this bunch. And the two big ones
are, for the Republicans, Chris Christie, who

23
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:52,219
ran the Republican Governors Association and
so gets a lot of the credit for the fact that

24
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:58,430
Republicans won a bunch of governor elections
in blue states. So now Christie can go in

25
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,960
2016 and argue to Republicans that not only
has he shown that he can win in a blue state

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,810
like New Jersey, but he was actually able
to lead other Republican governors to win

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,140
in blue states like Maine and Massachusetts
and Maryland. That's going to be a really

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,620
powerful appeal to a party that has not won
a presidential election in a long time. On

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,930
the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton comes
out of this looking pretty good actually.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,440
Democrats are going to know they can lose
an election so they're going to want a trusted commodity

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,610
who's pretty damn good at running campaigns.
And a lot of possible competitors to Hillary

32
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,840
Clinton who could have rose up during a successful
Democratic election either don't exist or

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,569
they got cut down. The fifth: It is just going
to be a lot harder for the Obama administration

34
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,099
to really do anything going forward. That's
true obviously because there are going to

35
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:46,480
be more Republicans and Republicans have not
shown much inclination to compromise with

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,980
President Obama. But also Democrats have just
lost an election, in part because the president

37
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,360
was an anchor around their campaigns because
his approval ratings are bad; they feel like

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,129
he did not do a good job helping their campaigns
by sticking to a good message in the run-up.

39
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,360
So he's going to have even less leverage among
members of Congress. Meanwhile he's been promising

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,129
a big executive action on immigration reform.
Is he really going to legalize millions of

41
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,330
immigrants? The administration thinks they
will. They reiterated it on election day,

42
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,700
but it's hard to believe. In the end, most
of this comes down to one thing: This was

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,879
a bad election for Democrats. It was a bad
election for Democrats because the electorate

44
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,170
is unhappy and they're angry. They haven't
necessarily changed their opinions on very

45
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,920
much. They don't necessarily think Paul Ryan
is right about everything and they certainly

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,470
don't think President Obama is right about
everything. But they are tired of watching

47
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,580
Washington fail them. And they are very, very
angry at the party that is supposed to be

48
00:03:42,580 --> 00:00:00,000
in control for letting that happen.
