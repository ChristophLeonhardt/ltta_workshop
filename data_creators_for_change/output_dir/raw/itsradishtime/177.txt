week of the 52 weeks project it is and I

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's because this is less of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 52</font>

home and I mean you guys know this the

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,210
internet is kind of like a drug it's so

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,239
awesome but it completely disables my

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,789
ability to like reason and function

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,100
