there's a little-known service from Amazon it's suddenly in a great big spotlight Amazon recognition what is it a facial recognition tool that Amazon says can scan in real time comedy says the tool can determine a person's age gender mood even if their identity if they're in their database and it's using the ability to track as a selling point pushing the ability to increase security in public places to home surveillance and video tagging it is already in use by Florida and Oregon law enforcement but privacy advocates say the tech giant's newest offering goes too far giving police expansive new search powers NBC's Kerry Sanders is live in Orlando where local police are using the technology Kerry as I read this story I was having flashbacks of the book 1984 which haunted me in high school and then for the next 20 years his Big Brother watching or is that in our future well Stephanie the Orlando Police Department of course doesn't believe this is 1984 and neither that is Amazon that is deploying this look we're probably all familiar with facial recognition because in our little electronic digital photos we can now sort our loved ones because of facial recognition the real game-changer here is artificial intelligence and that's where for instance in Oregon or here the officers are out and they've got maybe a body camera or as we know wherever we go in public there's a camera I don't know but there's probably three cameras that are picking me up right now beyond the television camera that is a database of information and the artificial intelligence that the police agencies can use is to load all of that imagery into an Amazon computer and at the same time they've already loaded a database mugshots people that are on the ten most wanted list all sorts of stuff and here's where the computer does what man can't it just sorts through it so quickly and it says to officer friendly walking down the street that guy that you took a picture of and that you sent into the computer that's somebody we're looking for and they turn around the problem is you're out in public you're walking around and something happened in your life but you now on this narrow the computer is telling the officer who you are what you've done in other words your privacy out on the public is not necessarily privacy anymore and that has some people concerned I can understand the things that in the wrong hands it could be very dangerous and I also think some people are gonna feel like it's gonna be another way the government is kind of peering into our lives and big brother's watching as I think you know if you're using it for law enforcement I would think that there would be enough parameters that would be in place to protect people from it being abused and so the police say this is all about public safety and we will likely see more of this Amazon weighed in saying Amazon requires that customers comply with the law and be responsible when they use Amazon Web Services which is a function of when we find that am a job Amazon Web Services are being abused by a customer in this case possibly the police department we suspend that customers right to use our services but Amazon clearly believes Stephanie that this is going to be a growing area of law enforcement and again it's all because of the ability of artificial intelligence all right well we know that the criticisms are people are just uncomfortable they feel like it's it's Big Brother watching but from a law enforcement perspective or there you said you believe that it's going to be used more broadly in law enforcement is there any side of the law that says nope we don't want it or is it just a budget issue so far it's so new and it's just being deployed you know here in Orlando it's in a testing phase but there's a general excitement among law enforcement to be able to use the power of a computer to help ferret out individuals in a public area let's say you were going to a soccer game across town and you and 10,000 other people are walking through the gates that camera is taking the picture that picture frame can then be put in the computer let's say there's a hundred people in the picture the computer can scan through the hundred people in that freeze frame and then compare it to everybody that is in the database of maybe people they're looking for criminals and say you know what John Smith who we've been looking for for three years just walk to the soccer game here's what he looks like he's wearing a blue shirt his hair is combed to the side and they can then look at the picture kind of scan around and then they could possibly go find them or as a mom with three kids who walk into amusement parks and run in two different directions the idea of being able to track them down makes me feel pretty good hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest
