well now let's return to our top story britain's Foreign Secretary has held a joint news conference with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov following bilateral talks when it comes as relations between the two nations are at an historic low well to discuss their talks let's cross live now to Ken Livingstone the former mayor of London I know they can't thank you for joining us man what do you make of these talks I mean Boris has said a lot of negative things about Russia recently I mean do you think the tone is improved today well while he's there he'll try and be a bit Pleasant and nice but it's not just the things Boris said oh hey Theresa mayor's made a whole series of unremitting and unrelenting attacks on Russia and I need to understand what's happened here I it was kept very suppressed but back in Obama's administration he tried to put together a coalition against China he tried to I mean Japan South Korea he wanted rush or he wanted India in because America is frightened about China's growing economy and President Putin wouldn't do that I mean it's important that Russia trades with China I as this vast border and ever since Putin refused to get behind this sort of energy China muscle eyes they've been these unremitting attacks about now this week interfering over the Internet in our elections and in a vote all of which are being challenged by academics studying the data well job Boris he also called himself a russophile Oh me what do you think of that I mean basically having known Boris for a very long time and fought through elections against him I never believe a word he said but he says whatever he thinks I will go down well at the time and his other big weaknesses is usually not read all the briefing documents his civil servants have provided him which is why makes sometimes catastrophic mistakes that he did about the woman detained in and Tehran saying she'd been threatening journalists when she hadn't I'm so basically Boris isn't even really a politician he wants to be a celebrity he doesn't have a great strategy or anything so it will just be responding to events as they come when he gets back in London almost ready to a wide-ranging done see a tion of president Putin's government well it's all so let's go back to this press conference and entertaining though it was as well and also revealing some of the language that he used I mean he said there's abundant evidence of Russian interference in elections worldwide well Sergey Lavrov said the allegation was a Western campaign I mean this is a this is old rhetoric isn't it what do you think this is still going well I I was in Russia in 1996 when you had Yeltsin up for re-election as president and that election was totally rigged and I suspect it was a considerable degree of American interference in that because sooo gone off who was the Communist Party candidate and most properly really won by about 54 to 46 and all of that was suppressed and Yeltsin who by that stage was completely a dysfunctional carried on I think that's why when Putin came to power and really started to really dig the government and set a real agenda people felt such a sense of relief well okay I mean find a question is that we've reached this point where it's an all-time low between the relations between the UK and Russia I mean do you think any breakthrough has been made already or will be made doing this this initial conversation that we're having between Sergey Lavrov and Boris Johnson I I think that unless Russia starts taking in anti-china stance and you'll continue to see attacks from America and its allies like rims on on Russia and that I mean America's establishment cannot accept the fact that China's economy is about to overtake America I mean and within the bureaucracy the State Department they're still debating how can America remain the global superpower well that world's coming to an end there's going to be several great powers not one great superpower anymore and America just doesn't seem to come to terms with us
