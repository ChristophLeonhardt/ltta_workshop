Tucker: A PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A BIZARRE EXCHANGE OF WITH JIM ACOSTA OF CNN TODAY. ACOSTA SUGGESTED THE PRESIDENT HAD A DUTY OF SOME KIND OF TO TAKE ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM A FEMALE REPORTER, JUST AS SOON AS JIM ACOSTA GOT TO ASK THE QUESTION. IF YOU DON'T MIND AFTER I'M FINISHED, IF ONE OF OUR FEMALE COLLEAGUES COULD GO AFTER ME, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. MR. PRESIDENT, TO FOLLOW UP ON THESE ALLEGATIONS President Trump: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT? I WOULD BE HAPPY IF A FEMALE REPORTER WOULD ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THAT ISSUE. IF YOU DON'T MIND President Trump: I WOULDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL, IT WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME. Tucker: JIM ACOSTA, A BIG FOR WOMEN. AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST OF MARK STEYN JOINS US TONIGHT. SO LET'S JUST BE LITERAL FOR A MINUTE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY? I'M NOT SURE. IN PRESS CONFERENCES THOUGH IF JIM ACOSTA IS IN THE ROOM, I'M IN FAVOR OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND IT IS ACTUALLY FAR MORE CONDESCENDING AND SEXIST THAN ALL THE OLD, DEAD, WHITE REPUBLICAN MEN ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. ORRIN HATCH IN THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES COULDN'T BE MORE SEXIST AND CONS A CONDESCENDING THAN THAT. WOMEN REPORTER REPORTERS GENERALLY ARE TOUGH, THEY DON'T NEED GENTLEMAN JIM ACOSTA TO HOLD THE DOOR FOR THEM TO LET THEM THROUGH SO THEY CAN GET A QUESTION IN. ROSLYN RUSSELL, IN HIS GIRL FRIDAY, ROSE RUSSELL PLAYED A TOUGH NO-NONSENSE REPORTER AND SHE WOULD HAVE PUNCHED HIS LIGHTS OUT. Tucker: I'M NOT MAKING ANY SPECIFIC CLAIMS AGAINST ANYBODY BUT, HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE LOUDEST NOISE IS WHAT FEMINISTS THEY ARE TEND TO HAVE A MORE SPOTTY RECORD WITH WOMEN IN THEIR OWN LIVES? I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE HE PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE HO PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE HR I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE HT MEDIA SAVAGERY. THEY HAVE HAD A HARD YEAR AND LOST THE SENATOR, AND WHETHER IT'S CHARLIE ROSE OR MATT LAUER OR HEIDI WEINSTEIN, AND MAYBE ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT JELL-O BRAND HAS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED WIT WITH. Tucker: SHEET THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS KAVANAUGH STORY HAS SIMPLY NOT JUST IGNORED PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BUT SHE'S BRAGGED ABOUT IT. TO THOSE WHO I HEAR YOU SAY OVER AND OVER, THIS ISN'T FAIR TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE'S ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS, WHAT ABOUT PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE UNTIL HE'S PROVEN GUILTY? HE'S NOT ENTITLED TO THOSE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY THINKING TO CONVICT HIM. Tucker: SHE BASICALLY SAYS IF YOU SUPPORT DUE PROCESS AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, YOU'RE PART OF THE PROCESS, PROBLEM SO SHUT UP. AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. LORD CHANCELLOR IN ENGLAND DID THE THING THAT EVENTUALLY BECAME THE U.N. DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE ISN'T JUST A CRIMINAL COURT VALUE, IT'S ACTUALLY A CIVIL RIGHT. IT'S WHAT VISCOUNT SANKEY CALLED THE GOLDEN LAW. AND, IT'S NOT A CRIMINAL COURT. IT'S BEYOND THAT, IT'S A U.S. EQUIVALENT OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR. AND WHEN THE STATE ACTUALLY SAYS IT'S A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, ONE OF AMERICANS OUT OF 300 MILLION GET TO BE U.S. SENATORS, AND NOT SOMETHING THAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE MOST POWERFUL FIGURES IN THE LAND LIKE CARSON MILLER KNOW MIKE GILLIBRAND, ARE WILLING TO TRASH YOU MENTIONED MARK JUDGE, FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS WHEN PEOPLE GOOGLE HIS NAME WAS
