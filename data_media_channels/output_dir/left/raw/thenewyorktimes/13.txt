00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,850
Naked mole rats are every bit
as strange as they sound.

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,250
They’re cold-blooded
mammals that

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,580
live underground in
big colonies run by a queen.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,380
They almost never
get cancer

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,260
and they can survive for
18 minutes with zero oxygen.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,630
They lose consciousness,
and their heart rate

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,910
and breathing slow
way down.

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,650
But as soon as oxygen
is available again,

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,009
they perk right up.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,890
A mouse, on the other hand,
lasts about a minute.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,620
Researchers at the
University of Illinois-Chicago,

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,900
along with colleagues
in Europe and Africa,

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,270
used a variety of
metabolic tests

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,120
to figure out
what was going on.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,460
In low-oxygen environments —

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,270
pretty common underground —

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,500
mole rats can change
their energy metabolism,

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,430
in all their crucial organs,

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,700
so they don’t need oxygen.
They switch fuels,

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,900
like a hybrid car.

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,380
Instead of glucose
metabolized with oxygen,

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,310
they use fructose and
metabolize it without oxygen.

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,860
Knowing more about
this metabolic trick

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,720
might one day help in treating
heart attacks and strokes,

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:00:00,000
where a lack of
oxygen is a killer.
