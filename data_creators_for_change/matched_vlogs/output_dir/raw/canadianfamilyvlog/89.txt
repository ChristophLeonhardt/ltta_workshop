night I know you guys probably laughing

159
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,559
at me right now I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save time in</font>

160
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,910
the morning because I have to do a

161
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">bony's hair curly so I'm doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that hot</font>

162
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,809
rollers and I didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to get</font>

163
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,540
myself and her ready so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I just</font>

164
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,980
can focus on the kids and just get

165
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,949
myself ready so I got these hot waves

166
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,480
they're called and apparently you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

167
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,819
put them in wet and then you can like

168
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:50,040
sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them or you can blow dry them</font>

169
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,169
or whatever but you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when your hair</font>

170
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:53,819
is wet so it was supposed to save time

171
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:55,019
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it right off the</font>

172
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,309
shower and your hair don't have to dry

173
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,859
or you know anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that so I'm</font>

174
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:02,970
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it works so I really really</font>

175
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,100
hope it works because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took a while</font>

176
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,299
actually took good 35 40 minutes maybe

177
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:12,839
to do it and I almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> ran out of the hot</font>

178
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,179
ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like no and i had to like</font>

179
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,040

180
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,769
