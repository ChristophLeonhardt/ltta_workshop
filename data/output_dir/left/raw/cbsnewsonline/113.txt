1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,336
ABOUT LATELY, HOW HE IS 

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,005
CORRECTING THE TRADE IMBALANCES.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,539
MAKE YOU CAN SEE THE BIG BOARD 

4
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,775
IS OPEN AND WALL STREET IS SORT 

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,043
OF TAKING IT ALL IN 

6
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,010
ESSENTIALLY. 

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,080
YOU ARE NOT SEEING A HUGE 

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,450
INCREASE, ALTHOUGH THAT MAY 

9
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,452
CHANGE, OBVIOUSLY, IN THE 

10
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,553
MIDDLE OF THE TRADING DAY. 

11
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,788
I THINK IT WAS WHAT WE WERE 

12
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,156
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WITH 

13
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,658
KATIA DMITRIEVA  THIS IS GREAT 

14
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,693
NEWS IN THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT 

15
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,827
TO ADDRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

16
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,131
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS HAS 

17
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,465
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

18
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:32,832
SECOND QUARTER. 

19
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:33,800
THE QUESTION IS, IS IT 

20
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,133
SUSTAINABLE. 

21
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,435
THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN GROWING 

22
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,103
SINCE, OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

23
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,639
LAST FEW YEARS. 

24
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,708
>> NINE YEARS OR SO. 

25
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,477
>> A LOT OF MEASURES HAD BEEN 

26
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:49,849
TAKEN -- PUT INTO PLACE SUCH AS 

27
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,485
THE INTEREST RATE WHICH IS SORT 

28
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,355
OF GOOSING THE ECONOMY. 

29
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,423
WILL THE TAX PLAN AND THE 

30
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:01,828
TARIFFS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

31
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,062
IMPOSED ON SOME OF OUR TRADING 

32
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,063
PARTNERS, WILL THAT HAVE AN 

33
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,564
UPLIFTING EFFECT OR AN ADVERSE 

34
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:05,798
EFFECT? 

35
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:08,468
MANY BELIEVE IT WILL BE AN 

36
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,369
ADVERSE EFFECT IN THE MONTHS 

37
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,337
AND PERHAPS EVEN YEARS AHEAD. 

38
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,705
GENERALLY, THAT'S HOW TARIFFS 

39
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:12,972
WORK. 

40
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:18,511
THEY USE -- THEY USUALLY DAMPEN 

41
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:18,911
THE ECONOMY. 

42
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:19,746
THAT'S WHY SO MANY 

43
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,147
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT FOR THESE 

44
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,583
TARIFFS, INCLUDING THE SPEAKER 

45
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,918
OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN AND 

46
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,352
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN 

47
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,655
PARTY. 

48
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,290
THEY IN FACT, BELIEVE THEY ARE, 

49
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,691
IN SOME WAYS, ATTACKS ON THE 

50
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,091
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

51
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:36,463
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A 

52
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:48,408
BACKGROUND IN FINANCE, VLADIMIR.

53
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,609
SOME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THE 

54
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,777
FEAR OF THE TARIFFS, THAT SOME 

55
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,877
PEOPLE MAY HAVE MADE HEAVY-DUTY 

56
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:52,812
PURCHASES THEY MAY NOT HAVE 

57
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,514
MADE, IN ANTICIPATION THAT IT 

58
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,317
WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO 

59
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,518
PURCHASE THE THINGS THEY NEED. 

60
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,752
THAT MAY BE WHAT WE ARE SEEING 

61
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:00,053
HERE. 

62
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,354
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, AS MAJOR 

63
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,188
GARRETT POINTS OUT, THE 

64
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,022
PRESIDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN 

65
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,023
TRAIL, AND EVEN AFTER HIS 

66
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:04,924
INAUGURATION, TALKED ABOUT HOW 

67
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:05,658
HE EXPECTED THE ECONOMIC 

68
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,859
POLICIES THAT HE WOULD PUT INTO 

69
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:13,600
PLACE WOULD LEAD TO A STRONGER 

70
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,167
AND HIGHER GDP. 

71
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,401
I'M SURE HE'S GOING TO ADDRESS 

72
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,703
THAT AT SOME POINT IN HIS 

73
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,804
SPEECH HE'S GOING TO MAKE TO 

74
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,805
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH IS 

75
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,039
THAT HE'S GOING TO SAY THAT 

76
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,241
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MOVES THAT 

77
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,508
HE HAS MADE THAT WE ARE 

78
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,677
STARTING TO SEE THIS GDP GROWTH.

79
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,580
IT'S EVERY PRESIDENT'S 

80
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,615
PREROGATIVE TO TELL THE ECONOMY 

81
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:33,886
WHEN THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL. 

82
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:34,921
EVERY PRESIDENT HAS DONE IT 

83
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,122
GOING BACK TO THE VERY FIRST 

84
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:36,422
PRESIDENT. 

85
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,156
THE QUESTION, OF COURSE, 

86
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,490
BECOMES IF THIS IS NOT 

87
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,792
SUSTAINABLE, THEN WHAT DO 

88
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,661
YOU.TO AS THE REASONS FOR THE 

89
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,862
LACK OF CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE 

90
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,231
QUARTERS AHEAD. 

91
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:50,136
THE MARKET IS ONLY UP ABOUT 38 

92
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:50,837
POINTS RIGHT NOW. 

93
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,738
THAT'S BECAUSE, I THINK, WALL 

94
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,172
STREET HAS MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT 

95
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:53,372
THIS. 

96
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:57,343
AS THEY LOOK AHEAD, THEY ARE 

97
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,878
PERHAPS WORRIED THAT THIS WILL 

98
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,079
HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE 

99
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,313
ECONOMY AND ON PEOPLE'S 

100
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:05,451
POCKETBOOKS IN THE QUARTERS 

101
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,786
AHEAD. 

102
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,021
TO THE BIG HEADLINE YESTERDAY, 

103
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,222
MAYBE NOT THE BIG ONE BUT ONE 

104
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,456
OF THE HEADLINES, WAS ABOUT THE 

105
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,091
DEFICIT AND THE FACT THAT THE 

106
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,493
GOP TAX LAW, THE TAX CUTS MAY 

107
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,762
RESULT IN A HUGE BOOST IN THE 

108
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:24,304
DEFICIT, UP TO $1 TRILLION. I'M 

109
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,038
SURE THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE 

110
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,272
TO PIVOT BACK TO SOMETHING MORE 

111
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:26,539
POSITIVE. 

112
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,073
YOU ARE RIGHT. 

113
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,107
THIS IS GOOD NEWS. 

114
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:28,908
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE THE 

115
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,410
OPPORTUNITY TO LET PEOPLE KNOW 

116
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,612
WHAT'S HAPPENING. 

117
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,813
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 

118
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,148
SEE, ALSO, IF THE PRESIDENT IS 

119
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:39,919
JOINED BY WILBUR ROSS OR LARRY 

120
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,154
KUDLOW, SOME OF THE ADVISORS HE 

121
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,922
HAS BROUGHT ONTO HIS TEAM TO, 

122
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,591
IN HIS MIND, HE WAS PART OF THE 

123
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,826
FACT THAT HE WAS BRINGING SOME 

124
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,127
OF THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST IN 

125
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,062
FINANCE IN THE WORLD OF 

126
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,663
FINANCE, FROM WALL STREET, TO 

127
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,298
GIVE HIM IDEAS AND INPUT INTO 

128
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:57,537
WAYS TO MAKE THE ECONOMY GROW. 

129
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,771
I'M SURE, THAT'S ONE OF THE 

130
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,239
THINGS HE'S GOING TO TALK 

131
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,911
ABOUT, THE PEOPLE HE HAS 

132
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,145
BROUGHT ONTO HIS TEAM INCLUDING 

133
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,013
CABINET SECRETARIES WHO HAVE 

134
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,014
CONTRIBUTED, BASED ON THEIR 

135
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:08,581
IDEAS, TO THIS TREMENDOUS 

136
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,982
GROWTH THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE 

137
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:10,983
SECOND QUARTER. 

138
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:15,788
WE ARE STILL -- WE WERE TOLD 

139
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:16,689
THERE WAS A TWO-MINUTE WARNING. 

140
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,322
YOU CAN SEE THE PRESS HAS 

141
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:22,461
GATHERED THERE. 

142
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,596
THE PRESIDENT, AS I SAID, IT'S 

143
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,430
THE PREROGATIVE OF THE 

144
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,431
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

145
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,432
TO TALK ABOUT POSITIVE GROWTH, 

146
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,467
STRONG GROWTH, BECAUSE IT DOES 

147
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,634
AFFECT ALL AMERICANS. 

148
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:33,706
I'M SURE HE WILL GET, IF HE 

149
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,741
TAKES ANY QUESTIONS, HE WILL 

150
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,742
GET SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. 

151
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,210
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE 

152
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,244
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT 

153
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,045
ARE BREWING, INCLUDING MICHAEL 

154
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,380
COHEN, WHO WIN JUST THE COURSE 

155
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,317
OF ONE WEEK, RELEASED AUDIO 

156
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,551
TAPE OF HER RECORDING HE MADE 

157
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,853
OF A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH 

158
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,787
PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH REGARDS TO 

159
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,523
PAYMENTS MADE TO A FORMER 

160
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:55,495
PLAYBOY PLAYMATE, KAREN McDOUGAL

161
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:55,695
. 

162
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,965
>> I DON'T THINK YOU ARE 

163
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,966
ELEVATING HER, GIVING HER A 

164
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,802
PROMOTION SHE DOESN'T DESERVE. 

165
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,203
TO AS YOU CAN SEE, WILBUR ROSS 

166
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,273
IS THERE AND I'M SURE HE'S VERY 

167
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:13,146
HAPPY TO HAVE HIM ON HIS TEAM. 

168
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,380
ALSO STEVE MNUCHIN IS THERE AS 

169
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,580
WELL. 

170
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,615
MY EYES ARE GETTING OLD. 

171
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,816
>> IT'S A TINY SCREEN. 

172
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,087
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT VLADIMIR. 

173
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,355
THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD SOME 

174
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:27,593
RECENT WINS AND THIS IS ONE. 

175
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,828
WE HAVE NEWS OF THE POSSIBLE 

176
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,394
REMAINS OF AMERICAN 

177
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:30,830
SERVICEMEMBERS IN THE KOREAN 

178
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:39,972
WAR BEING RETURNED. THAT'S A 

179
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:40,172
WIN. 

180
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:41,373
AND A MEETING WITH THE EU, I 

181
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,475
THINK, WAS ALSO A WIN. 

182
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,943
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN THAT 

183
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:44,844
THE TARIFFS WOULD HAVE AN 

184
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,678
INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON 

185
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,278
FARMERS, IN PARTICULAR. 

186
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:47,680
HE HAS PROMISED TO DEAL, IN 

187
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,514
PARTICULAR, WHEN IT COMES TO 

188
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,015
SOYBEAN FARMERS. 

189
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,349
THERE'S A LOT OF THE THINGS FOR 

190
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,384
THE PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT. 

191
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,919
YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S ALSO THE 

192
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,553
SCANDALS BREWING. 

193
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:59,058
>> AND HERE IS THE PRESIDENT OF 

194
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,092
THE UNITED STATES ALONG WITH 

195
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,594
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 

196
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:01,927
LET'S LISTEN. 

197
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:02,361
>> GOOD MORNING. 

198
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,329
MOMENTS AGO, THE NUMBERS FOR 

199
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,465
THE AMERICAS ECONOMIC GROWTH OR 

200
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:10,803
GDP -- AMERICA'S ECONOMIC 

201
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,371
GROWTH, OR GDP, WILL RELEASE. 

202
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:16,642
I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT IN 

203
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,543
THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS 

204
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,578
YEAR, THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY 

205
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,012
GREW AT THE AMAZING RATE OF 4. 

206
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:20,379
1 PERCENT. 

207
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,949
WE ARE ON TRACK TO HIT THE 

208
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:24,550
HIGHEST ANNUAL AVERAGE GROWTH 

209
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,121
RATE IN OVER 13 YEARS. I WILL 

210
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,123
SAY THIS RIGHT NOW AND I WILL 

211
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,492
SAY IT STRONGLY, AS THE TRADE 

212
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,027
DEALS COME IN ONE BY ONE, WE 

213
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,996
ARE GOING TO GO A LOT HIGHER 

214
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,433
THAN THESE NUMBERS, AND THESE 

215
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:40,900
ARE GREAT NUMBERS. 

216
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,200
DURING EACH OF THE TWO PREVIOUS 

217
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,335
ADMINISTRATIONS WE AVERAGE JUST 

218
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:51,110
OVER 1.8% GDP GROWTH. 

219
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,212
WE ARE NOW ON TRACK TO REACH 

220
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,548
GDP ANNUAL GROWTH OF OVER 3% 

221
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,583
AND HE COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY 

222
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,383
OVER 3%. 

223
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:02,822
EACH POINT, BY THE WAY, MEANS 

224
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,259
APPROXIMATELY $3 TRILLION AND 

225
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,126
10 MILLION JOBS. 

226
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,363
IF YOU GO UP ONE POINT, THAT 

227
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,998
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT 

228
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,598
IT'S A LOT. 

229
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:19,906
IT'S $3 TRILLION AND ITS 10 

230
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:20,373
MILLION JOBS. 

231
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,507
IF ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES AT 

232
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,375
THIS PACE, THE UNITED STATES 

233
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,376
ECONOMY WILL DOUBLE IN SIZE, 

234
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,478
MORE THAN 10 YEARS FASTER THAN 

235
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,445
IT WOULD HAVE UNDER EITHER 

236
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,746
PRESIDENT BUSH OR PRESIDENT 

237
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:28,848
OBAMA. 

238
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,516
PERHAPS, ONE OF THE BIGGEST 

239
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,018
WINS IN THE REPORT, AND IT IS 

240
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,553
INDEED A BIG ONE, IS THAT THE 

241
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:38,190
TRADE DEFICIT, VERY DEAR TO MY 

242
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,191
HEART BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN 

243
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,626
RIPPED OFF BY THE WORLD, HAS 

244
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:47,733
DROPPED BY MORE THAN $50 BILLION

245
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,735
, $52 BILLION TO BE EXACT. 

246
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,772
THINK OF THAT. THE TRADE 

247
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,373
DEFICIT HAS DROPPED BY MORE 

248
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,175
THAN $50 BILLION. 

249
00:07:56,175 --> 00:08:08,254
THAT IS ADDING 1.2 GDP. 

250
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,055
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS DROP. 

251
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,659
WE HAVE NOT HAD A DROP LIKE THAT

252
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,594
IN A LONG TIME. 

253
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,962
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK A 

254
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,396
LONG TIME BEFORE YOU FIND THAT. 

255
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,230
BY INCREASING GROWTH 3% OVER 

256
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,632
THE NEXT 10 YEARS, THAT WOULD 

257
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,166
MEAN 12 MILLION NEW AMERICAN 

258
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:25,538
JOBS AND $10 TRILLION OF NEW 

259
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,107
AMERICAN WEALTH, AT LEAST. 

260
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,442
THAT'S NOT INCLUDING THE FACT 

261
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,378
THAT SINCE I WAS ELECTED, WE 

262
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,845
HAVE CREATED APPROXIMATELY $7 

263
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:39,452
TRILLION OF NEW WEALTH. THE 

264
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,552
YEAR BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE, 

265
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,186
PRIVATE BUSINESS INVESTMENT 

266
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:49,362
GREW AT ONLY ONE .8% -- 1.8%. 

267
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:54,767
LAST YEAR GREW BY 6.3%. THAT 

268
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,002
WAS MY FIRST YEAR AND THERE 

269
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,570
WERE A LOT OF THINGS WE HAVE TO 

270
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,638
DO TO MAKE IT GROW. 

271
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,205
THIS YEAR IT'S GROWING AT 9.4 

272
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:06,145
PERCENT -- 9.4%. THERE HASN'T 

273
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,913
BEEN AN INCREASE LIKE THAT IN 

274
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:10,149
MANY YEARS, DECADES. 

275
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,352
LARRY KUDLOW JUST CONFIRMED TO 

276
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:17,456
ME THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE VERY 

277
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,225
SUSTAINABLE. THIS ISN'T A ONE 

278
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:19,558
TIME SHOT. 

279
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,993
I HAPPEN TO THINK WE ARE GOING 

280
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:21,994
TO DO EXTRAORDINARILY WELL IN 

281
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,029
OUR NEXT REPORT NEXT QUARTER. 

282
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,431
I THINK IT'S GOOD TO BE 

283
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:29,502
OUTSTANDING. I WON'T GO TOO 

284
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,703
STRONG BECAUSE THEN IF IT'S NOT 

285
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,505
QUITE AS GOOD, YOU WILL NOT LET 

286
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:32,938
ME FORGET IT. 

287
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,707
I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE GOING 

288
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,209
TO BE OUTSTANDING. WE HAVE 

289
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:37,843
ACCOMPLISHED AN ECONOMIC 

290
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,212
TURNAROUND OF HISTORIC 

291
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,613
PROPORTIONS. WHEN I CAME INTO 

292
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:48,387
OFFICE, 1.5 MILLION PRIMATE 

293
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,492
AMERICANS WERE WORKING VAN 

294
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,093
EIGHT YEARS BEFORE. 

295
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:54,894
WE LOST ALMOST 200,000 

296
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:55,828
MANUFACTURING JOBS UNDER THE 

297
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,928
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND YOU 

298
00:09:56,928 --> 00:10:02,401
ALL KNOW. THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO 

299
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,135
LOSE MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

300
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,770
IT WILL GET WORSE AND WORSE. 

301
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,673
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE 

302
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:07,940
OBSOLETE. 

303
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,674
THEY ARE NOT OBSOLETE. 

304
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,942
THEY ARE THE GREATEST JOBS WE 

305
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,342
HAVE. 

306
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,243
MORE THAN 10 MILLION ADDITIONAL 

307
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,178
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO 

308
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,780
FOOD STAMPS IN PAST YEARS. WE 

309
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,315
HAVE TURNED IT ALL AROUND. 

310
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,318
ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE THE ECONOMIC 

311
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,156
ENVY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. WHEN 

312
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,157
I MEET THE LEADERS OF 

313
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,625
COUNTRIES, THE FIRST THING THEY 

314
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:31,864
SAY INVARIABLY IS, MR. 

315
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,099
PRESIDENT, SO NICE TO MEET YOU. 

316
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:33,799
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR 

317
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,065
ECONOMY. 

318
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:34,934
YOU ARE LEADING THE ENTIRE 

319
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:35,167
WORLD. 

320
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,735
THEY SAY IT ALMOST EACH AND 

321
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:41,173
EVERY TIME. AMERICA IS BEING 

322
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,208
RESPECTED AGAIN AND AMERICA IS 

323
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,308
WINNING AGAIN BECAUSE WE ARE 

324
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,610
FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 

325
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,878
EVERYWHERE WE LOOK, WE ARE 

326
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,512
SEEING THE EFFECTS OF THE 

327
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:50,582
AMERICAN ECONOMIC MIRACLE. WE 

328
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:54,820
HAVE ADDED 3.7 MILLION NEW JOBS 

329
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,954
SINCE THE ELECTION. 

330
00:10:55,954 --> 00:11:00,359
A NUMBER THAT IS UNTHINKABLE, 

331
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,727
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN, 

332
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:07,433
NOBODY WOULD'VE SAID IT. NOBODY 

333
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,867
WOULD'VE EVEN, IN AN OPTIMISTIC 

334
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:09,301
WAY, PROJECTED IT. 

335
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,569
WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE 

336
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,771
LONGEST POSITIVE JOB GROWTH 

337
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,773
STREAK IN HISTORY. 

338
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,507
NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS HAVE 

339
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,476
RECENTLY ACHIEVED THEIR LOWEST 

340
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,577
LEVEL. 

341
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,480
THAT'S THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 

342
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,483
ALMOST A HALF CENTURY. 

343
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:24,983
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 

344
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:25,785
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS ACHIEVE 

345
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,987
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN RECORDED 

346
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,188
HISTORY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN 

347
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,391
UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE BEST IT HAS 

348
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,593
EVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

349
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,061
COUNTRY. 

350
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:37,263
THE HISPANIC AN EMPLOYMENT RATE 

351
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,865
HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL, 

352
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,934
LIKEWISE, IN HISTORY. 

353
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,469
THE ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS 

354
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,438
RECENTLY REACHED THE LOWEST 

355
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,875
LEVEL, AGAIN, LIKEWISE, IN 

356
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,810
HISTORY. 

357
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:57,583
WOMEN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE 

358
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,519
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 65 

359
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,454
YEARS AND SOON THAT WILL BE IN 

360
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:02,855
HISTORY. 

361
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,290
GIVE IT ANOTHER TWO OR THREE 

362
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,690
WEEKS. 

363
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,924
VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS 

364
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,761
LOWEST LEVEL IN 18 YEARS AND 

365
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:13,833
THAT NUMBER IS RAPIDLY GOING UP

366
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,470
, ON TOP OF WHICH WE JUST 

367
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,305
RECEIVED FROM CONGRESS, CHOICE 

368
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,506
WHERE VETERANS CAN GO OUT AND 

369
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,941
SEE A DOCTOR IF THEY CAN'T GET 

370
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,241
SERVICE, THE SERVICE THEY 

371
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,610
DESERVE. 

372
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,278
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR DISABLED 

373
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,049
AMERICANS HAS HIT A RECORD LOW, 

374
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,518
LOWEST IN HISTORY, MORE THAN 

375
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,654
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS LIFTED 

376
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,588
OFF OF FOOD STAMPS, SOMETHING 

377
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,692
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN DECADES. 

378
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,193
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 

379
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:45,731
LIFTED OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 

380
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,732
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE 

381
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:52,772
TO GO OUT AND GET A JOB AND 

382
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,906
THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE THEIR 

383
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,106
JOBS. 

384
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:54,873
95% OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS 

385
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,075
ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR 

386
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:07,052
COMPANY'S OUTLOOK. THAT'S THE 

387
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:07,853
HIGHEST LEVEL, ALSO, IN 

388
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:08,120
HISTORY. 

389
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,988
THAT'S AN OLD SURVEY. 

390
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,188
THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG 

391
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:10,388
TIME. 

392
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:10,922
MANUFACTURING WAGES ARE 

393
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,124
EXPECTED TO RISE AT THE FASTEST 

394
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,158
RATE IN OVER 17 YEARS. 

395
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,059
BUSINESS AND CONSUMER 

396
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,096
CONFIDENCE HAS REACHED HISTORIC 

397
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,231
HIGHS. SO FAR THIS YEAR, 

398
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,434
AMERICAN EXPORTS ARE UP NEARLY 

399
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:28,274
20%. I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A 

400
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,575
LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AND A 

401
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:29,775
HALF. 

402
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,443
OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN THE 

403
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,680
YEAR BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE, WE 

404
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,151
HAD TO BECOME A NET EXPORTER OF 

405
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,853
NATURAL GAS FOR THE FIRST TIME 

406
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:45,691
SINCE 1957. WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF 

407
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,292
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF 

408
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,326
REGULATIONS WHICH ALLOWS US TO 

409
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:47,893
DO THINGS. 

410
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,261
WE STILL HAVE TREMENDOUS 

411
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,631
REGULATIONS ON CLEAN-AIR, CLEAN 

412
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:56,468
WATER, THE ENVIRONMENT. 

413
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,269
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO 

414
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,569
EVERYBODY. 

415
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,271
BUT WE HAVE NECESSARY 

416
00:13:59,271 --> 00:13:59,905
REGULATIONS THAT WERE HURTING 

417
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,340
OUR ECONOMY AND HURTING OUR 

418
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
COUNTRY. 

419
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343
WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD 

420
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,511
NUMBER OF JOB KILLING 

421
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,780
REGULATIONS, AND WITH THE HELP 

422
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,214
OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE 

423
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,350
PASSED, WITHOUT ONE DEMOCRAT 

424
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:18,490
VOTE, THE BIGGEST TAX REFORM IN 

425
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:18,756
HISTORY. 

426
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:20,359
AND AS YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS WANT 

427
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:26,966
TO REFORMAT AND RAISE 

428
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:27,399
EVERYONE'S TAXES. 

429
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,634
THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR 

430
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:28,967
OUR ECONOMY. 

431
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,169
AS A RESULT, MORE THAN 6 

432
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:30,970
MILLION AMERICANS ARE NOW 

433
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,837
ENJOYING NEW BONUSES, BETTER 

434
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,172
JOBS, AND FAR BIGGER PAYCHECKS. 

435
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:38,310
YET EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT VOTED 

436
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,311
AGAINST THE TAX CUTS, EVERY 

437
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:39,712
SINGLE ONE. 

438
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,984
WE DIDN'T GET ONE SINGLE VOTE. 

439
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,818
THEY VOTED AGAINST WORKING 

440
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,085
FAMILIES. 

441
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:46,819
THEY VOTED AGAINST SMALL 

442
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,119
BUSINESSES. 

443
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:47,419
NOT GOOD! 

444
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,688
IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS AFTER 

445
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,889
TAX CUTS, OVER $300 BILLION 

446
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,459
POURED BACK INTO THE UNITED 

447
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,661
STATES FROM OVERSEAS. 

448
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,962
WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN 

449
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,030
THE END, WHEN COMPLETED, OVER 

450
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,798
$4 TRILLION THAT WILL BE BACK 

451
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,033
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 

452
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,437
APPLE ALONE IS BRINGING IN $213 

453
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,339
MILLION -- $230 BILLION AND 

454
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,443
BUILDING A MAGNIFICENT CAMPUS. 

455
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,444
THEY ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING 

456
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,245
THEIR MONEY VERY WISELY. 

457
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,380
THEY ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY 

458
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,014
IN OUR COUNTRY, NOT IN SOMEBODY 

459
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,583
ELSE'S COUNTRY. 

460
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,884
THAT WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE 

461
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,321
NEW TAX CUT AND REFORM PLAN. 

462
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,422
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE 

463
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,490
FINALLY CRACKING DOWN ON 

464
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,557
DECADES OF ABUSIVE FOREIGN 

465
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:30,062
TRADE PRACTICE. WE WERE ABUSED 

466
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:30,429
BY COMPANIES. 

467
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,930
WE WERE ABUSED BY THE COMPANIES 

468
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,833
WITHIN COUNTRIES, BUT IN 

469
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,535
PARTICULAR, WE WERE ABUSED BY 

470
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,369
COUNTRIES THEMSELVES, INCLUDING 

471
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:42,841
ALLIES. WE WERE ABUSED LIKE NO 

472
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,009
NATION HAS EVER BEEN ABUSED ON 

473
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,444
TRADE BEFORE BECAUSE WE HAD 

474
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:51,150
NOBODY WATCHING. THEY STOLE OUR 

475
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,918
JOBS AND PLUNDERED OUR WEALTH 

476
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,387
BUT THAT ENDED. 

477
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,289
YESTERDAY I WAS AT GRANITE CITY 

478
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,389
STEEL IN ILLINOIS, AN 

479
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,360
INCREDIBLE SIGHT. 

480
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,500
WE HAD SOME OF THE ROUGHEST AND 

481
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,037
TOUGHEST PEOPLE YOU HAD EVER 

482
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:16,808
SEEN AND THEY HAD TEARS ROLLING 

483
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:17,476
DOWN THEIR FACES. 

484
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,044
HALF OF THEM HAD TEARS GOING ON 

485
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,348
BECAUSE WE OPENED A TREMENDOUS 

486
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,316
UNITED STATES STEEL PLANT. THEY 

487
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:29,455
ARE OPENING UP SEVEN OTHER 

488
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,157
PLANTS AND THE STEEL INDUSTRY 

489
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:32,457
IS BACK. 

490
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:33,492
THEY ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 

491
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
WE NEED THE STEEL INDUSTRY. 

492
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,497
THE TARIFFS DID IT. NOBODY 

493
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,631
MENTIONS THE FACT THAT THESE 

494
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,501
PLANTS ARE CREATING TREMENDOUS 

495
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:51,243
NUMBERS OF JOBS, TREMENDOUS. 

496
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,177
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE POURING 

497
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,378
INTO THE UNITED STATES COFFERS, 

498
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:53,845
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 

499
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,815
WE ARE GETTING JOBS. WE ARE 

500
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,484
GETTING MONEY COMING IN. 

501
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:05,624
WE ARE RESPECTED. EVENTUALLY 

502
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,625
THE STEEL PRICES WILL REALLY 

503
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,992
START TO GO DOWN BECAUSE ALL OF 

504
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,027
THESE NEW PLANTS WILL BE 

505
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,496
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER. 

506
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:15,834
WE DON'T HAVE CORN -- WE DON'T 

507
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,635
HAVE FOREIGN COUNTRIES DUMPING, 

508
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,969
THAT'S WHERE THEY USE, DUMPING, 

509
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,304
DESTROYING OUR PLANS AND 

510
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,405
COMPANIES AND DESTROYING OUR 

511
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:29,448
JOBS. SINCE I WAS ELECTED WE 

512
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,918
HAVE ADDED 400,000 NEW 

513
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,385
MANUFACTURING DEALS. 

514
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,219
REMEMBER, THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO 

515
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:34,786
BE OBSOLETE. 

516
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,054
I USED TO SAY, WHY IS IT 

517
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:36,321
OBSOLETE. 

518
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:41,460
WE HAVE TO MAKE THINGS. 

519
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:49,668
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE THE ROOT 

520
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,270
OF OUR COUNTRY. 

521
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,906
THE INDIVIDUAL MULTI-IS GONE 

522
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,539
FROM OUR HEALTHCARE. 

523
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,543
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO PUT 

524
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,280
MORE MONEY FORWARD FOR THE 

525
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,117
PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING THAT 

526
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:05,417
INSURANCE. 

527
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,318
THAT WAS THE MOST UNPOPULAR 

528
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,153
PROVISION BY FAR, PROBABLY ON 

529
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,555
ANYTHING, BUT CERTAINLY IN 

530
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,389
OBAMACARE. 

531
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,026
OBAMACARE IS ON ITS LAST LEG, 

532
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,359
FORTUNATELY. 

533
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,460
THROUGH ASSOCIATED HEALTH 

534
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,794
PLANS, WE ARE GIVING AMERICANS 

535
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:49,194
THE ABILITY THINK OF THAT. 

536
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:53,799
IT WILL COST US NOTHING. 

537
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,469
SECRETARY ACOSTA, SECRETARY A 

538
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:13,151
CZAR, AND -- AZAR, BETTER 

539
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,952
HEALTHCARE WILL COST OUR 

540
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:14,385
COUNTRY NOTHING. 

541
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:15,587
WE ARE FINALLY TAKING CARE OF 

542
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,121
OUR PEOPLE. 

543
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:16,888
FINALLY THERE'S ANOTHER MATTER 

544
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:20,859
THAT IS OF PROFOUND IMPORTANCE 

545
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,464
TO ME, AND I WISH TO DISCUSS IT 

546
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:30,102
BEFORE WE LEAVE. THERE'S NOTHING

547
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,702
MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE LIVES OF 

548
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,005
AMERICANS, AND LIVES ALL OVER 

549
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,972
THE WORLD. 

550
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:38,377
AT THIS MOMENT, AND AIRPLANE IS

00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,672

ABOUT IT. 

579
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:05,464
I WOULD LOOK AT THEM AND SAY, 

580
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,498

589
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:21,647
THEY WILL DO THAT.

615
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,496
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR TWO 

616
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,597
YEAR APPROVALS, AND MORE.

00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,331

622
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,476

624
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,779

MY FATHER AND MY UNCLE BOTH 

636
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,539

00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,475
MUCH IT MEANS TO THOSE VETERANS 

638
00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:59,644
THAT YOU DIDN'T FORGET THEIR 

639
00:22:59,644 --> 00:22:59,977

00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:02,347
YOU KNOW AS AN ECONOMIST SIR 

642
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,682
IT'S MY DUTY SIR TO REMIND THAT 

643
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,816
WE SHOULD NOT MAKE TOO MUCH OF 

644
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:06,618
ONE NUMBER RIGHT? 

645
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,853
HOW OFTEN DO ECONOMISTS SAY 

646
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,988
THAT IS THIS BUT WHEN I HAY -- 

647
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:10,255
SAY THAT? 

648
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,790
BUT WHEN I THEY BACK TO THE 

649
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,061
FIRST TIME I MET YOU IN THE 

650
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,062
OVAL AND MAKING AMERICA GREAT 

651
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:17,295
AGAIN. 

652
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,497
IN THE END I AGREED YEAH THAT 

653
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,263
STUFF REALLY OUGHT TO WORK. 

654
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,566
THE FACT IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT 

655
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,201
THE DATA TODAY THAT WE CAN SEE 

656
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,471
THE PROOF IN THE PUDDING THAT 

657
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,138
THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES ARE 

658
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:28,707
WORKING AND NOT JUST IN THE TOP 

659
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,709
LINE BUT IN THE DETAILS. 

660
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,944
THE PRESIDENT SAID IF WE 

661
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,213
DEREGULATE THE ECONOMY AND HAVE 

662
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:41,052
A -- THE FACTORIES WILL COME 

663
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:41,453
BACK TO AMERICA. 

664
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:47,325
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, THEN 

665
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,061
-- FACTORIES ARE -- WE COULD 

666
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,096
BECOME A DOMINANT ENERGY 

667
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:51,696
ECONOMY EVEN AN ENERGY 

668
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,097
EXPORTER. 

669
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,131
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA TODAY 

670
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,634
ONE OF THE REASON WHY IT'S SO 

671
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,771
STRONG IS THAT DRILLING AND 

672
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,672
MINING ACTIVITIED SKYROCKETED 

673
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,540
AND AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED 

674
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:02,741
WAY. 

675
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:07,012
FINALLY THIS IS THE THING AT 

676
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,213
TIMES SIR, YOU SAID YOU WOULD 

677
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,314

DEFICIT DOWN AND YOU HAVE. 

680
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:13,985
THE $50 BILLION REDUCTION 

681
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,587
PROVES THAT IF YOU STAND UP FOR 

682
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,222
AMERICA'S WORKERS AND LET THE 

683
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,556
ALLIES KNOW THAT DEALS THAT ARE 

684
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:21,660
UNACCEPTABLE, THAT YOU CAN MAKE 

685
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,159
A LOT OF PROGRESS.

IT'S A LITTLE WARM OUT HERE SO 

693
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,237
I'LL BE AS QUICK AS I CAN. 

694
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,105
I WANT TO REITERATE WHAT 

695
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,141

LOOK, WE'VE HAD A PRO GROWTH 

698
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:39,577
AGENDA. 

699
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,012
AND IT HAS BEEN IF PLACE FOR A 

700
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,480
-- IN PLACE FOR A SHORT WHILE. 

701
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,949
IT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO 

702
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:44,149
WORK. 

703
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,421
LOW TAX RATES ROLL BACK OF 

704
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,055
REGULATIONS, UNLEASHING ENERGY 

705
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,691
AND TRADE REFORM TO FIX A 

706
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,291
BROKEN WORLD TRADING SYSTEM. 

707
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,126

9% TO 10% GROWTH IN THE FIRST 

712
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,436
HALF OF THIS YEAR, I BELIEVE 

713
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,636
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE. 

714
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,173
WHY DO I TALK ABOUT BUSINESS 

715
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:08,840
INVESTMENT? 

716
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,208
WELL, THAT'S THE KEY TO 

717
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,543
PRODUCTIVITY WHICH IS THE KEY 

718
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,577
TO GROWTH. 

719
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,278
WHICH IS THE KEY TO RISING REAL 

720
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:17,482
WAGES. 

721
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,316

00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,753
THE CAMPAIGN A MILLION TIMES 

724
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,455
AND WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IT. 

725
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,925
THESE TAX CUTS PARTICULARLY ON 

726
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,626
THE BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT 

727
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:32,531

728
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,635

735
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,444
SUSTAINABLE. 

736
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,580
FRANKLY AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN 

737
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,515

738
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,016

TREMENDOUS -- IN POINTING OUT

THE TREMENDOUS GROWTH THE

UNITED STATES' ECONOMY 

754
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:19,244
EXPERIENCED OVER THE COURSE OF 

755
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,744
THE SECOND QUARTER. 

756
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:20,945
4.1%. 

757
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,081
IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 

758
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,751
GROWTH GDP GROWTH RATE IN QUITE 

759
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,051
SOME TIME. 

760
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:27,351
SINCE 2013. 

761
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:27,652
>> YEP. 

762
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,987
>> AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING 

763
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,023
THAT HE AND THE MEMBERS OF HIS 

764
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,325
ECONOMIC TEAM ARE VERY PROUD 

765
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:34,492
OF. 

766
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,126
THERE'S PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

767
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:38,063
THAT ARE ADDING ME AND SAYING 

768
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,531
YOU KNOW, WE AS REPORTERS 

769
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,099
SHOULD BE -- MORE LAUDATORY 

770
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,101
TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT FOR THIS 

771
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:43,735
ACCOMPLISHMENT. 

772
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,270
>> IT'S A TREMENDOUS 

773
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,770
ACCOMPLISHMENT AND THE 

774
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,871
PRESIDENT SHOULD -- SHOULD LET 

775
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:47,738
US KNOW ABOUT IT. 

776
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:48,973
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, WE ALSO 

777
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,408
WANT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT TOO 

778
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,910
AND THAT'S WHY WE ASKED YOU 

779
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,179
KNOW ABOUT HOW LONG IS THIS 

780
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:54,779
SUSTAINABLE AND WHAT ARE WE 

781
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,413
GOING TO SEE FOR THE REST OF 

782
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,547
THE YEAR BUT THIS IS GREAT 

783
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:57,048
NEWS. 

784
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:57,214
S. 

785
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:58,215
>> GREAT NEWS FOR THE 

786
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:58,516
PRESIDENT. 

787
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,585
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE IS 

788
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,019
TALKED ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME 

789
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:02,587
TIME. 

790
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,655
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE 

791
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,023
CAMPAIGNED ON WHICH IS HE HAD 

792
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,926
TALKED OFTEN TIMES ON THE 

793
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,994
CAMPAIGN TRAIL ABOUT INCREASING 

794
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:10,561
THE GDP NUMBERS. 

795
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,130
LOOK I SPENT 20 YEARS ON WALL 

796
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,363
STREET. 

797
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:14,566
ANYTIME YOU CAN POINT TO A WIN, 

798
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,166
IT'S GREAT. 

799
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,201
BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES FOR 

800
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,002
EXAMPLE IN MY SITUATION, FOR 

801
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,236
OUR CLIENTS, IS IT SUSTAINABLE? 

802
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:20,405
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 

803
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,907
THINGS OVER THE COURSE OF AN 

804
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,009
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. 

805
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,311
AND THREE MONTH BLIP ON THE 

806
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:32,784
ECONOMICALLEN CAR, DOES NOT -- 

807
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,219
ECONOMIC CALENDAR DOES NOT MAKE 

808
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:34,685
AN ECONOMY. 

809
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:35,853
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES IT'S 

810
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,055
SUSTAINABLE AND THE NEBRASKAS 

811
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,357
OF THE -- MEMBERS OF THE 

812
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,626
ECONOMIC COUNCIL ALSO BELIEVE 

813
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,393
NUMBERS ARE SUSTAINABLE. 

814
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:42,893
PERHAPS THEY'RE RIGHT. 

815
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,629
THE THING IS YOU ARE LOOKING AT 

816
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,499
THE STOCK MARKET RIGHT NOW. 

817
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,235
THE MARKET REACTING SORT OF 

818
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,503
SIDEWAYS ABOUT THIS. 

819
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,003
THE DOW JONES IS UP SLIGHT BUT 

820
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,472
BUT WE NOTICED -- SLIGHTLY BUT 

821
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,842
WE'VE NOTICED THE AND P IS DOWN 

822
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,044
AND' -- S&P IS DOWN AND 

823
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,546
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF VOLATILITY 

824
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,214
IN THE TECH CENTER. 

825
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,315
TWITTER IS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY 

826
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,851
AND ENERGY IS ALSO TAKING HIT 

827
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,318
AS HAS FACEBOOK. 

828
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,087
FACEBOOK IS -- YOU KNOW BEEN 

829
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,421
CRUSHED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 

830
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:12,323
DAYS AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE 

831
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,759
REASON WHY WE'VE SEEN SOME OF 

832
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,195
THE VOLATILITY IN THE S&P AND 

833
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:17,828
THE NASDAQ. 

834
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:19,731
THE QUESTION OF COURSE BECOMES 

835
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,368
AS WE LOOK FORWARD AND WE SPOKE 

836
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,070
TO KATIA WHO -- WHO WORKS AT 

837
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,004
BLOOMBERG AND WE TALKED TO HER 

838
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,005
ABOUT AND WE ASKED HER 

839
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,606
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS CAN BE 

840
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,542
SUSTAINABLE OVER THE COURSE OF 

841
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,076
THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS. 

842
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:34,746
AND THE QUESTION, IT'S NOT A 

843
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:35,446
DEFINITE. 

844
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:36,814
BUT THE QUESTION THAT EVERYONE 

845
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:40,318
HAS IS BECAUSE THAT -- SOME 

846
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,419
PEOPLE, SOME FOLKS HAVE 

847
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,687
STOCKPILED SOME OF THE GOODS 

848
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:47,058
THAT ARE -- THE PRESIDENT HAS 

849
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:47,692
IMPOSED TARIFFS ON. 

850
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,193
>> PARTICULARLY SOYBEANS. 

851
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:51,429
>> IS THAT WHY WE'VE SEEN AT 

852
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:56,200
LEAST A 1 POINT INCREASE IN THE 

853
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,400
GDP? 

854
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,569
WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE CAN LOOK 

855
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,204
AT THE NEXT QUARTER AND THINGS 

856
00:28:59,204 --> 00:28:59,604
AFTER THAT. 

857
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:03,374
>> SO WE HAVE MAJOR GARRETT 

858
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,676
STANDING BY, HE IS THE WHITE 

859
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,877
HOUSE CHIEF CORRESPONDENT. 

860
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,845
>> Reporter: CLEARLY THE 

861
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,112
PRESIDENT IS NOT ONLY EXCITED 

862
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:10,648
ABOUT THIS ECONOMIC NEWS, BUT 

863
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,483
BELIEVES IT IS ECONOMIC 

864
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,083
VINDICATION FOR POLITICAL 

865
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:12,917
DECISIONS MOST OF THEM MADE IN 

866
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,453
THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS 

867
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,154
PRESIDENCY. 

868
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,623
ONE, TO TAKE A VERY AGGRESSIVE 

869
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,490
DEREGULATORY APPROACH TO WHAT 

870
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,257
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PUT IN 

871
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:23,060
ITS LAST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE. 

872
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,263
AND CAJOLE AND LOBBY AND WORK 

873
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,199
WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS TO 

874
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,435
PASS A LARGE CORPORATE TAX 

875
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,303
DECREASE, A LARGE PERSONAL 

876
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,939
INCOME TAX DECREASE, AND PUT 

877
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,507
REFORMS WITHIN THE SYSTEM. 

878
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:38,943
BOTH OF WHICH THE PRESIDENT 

879
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,844
SAYS IS RESPONSIBLE DIRECTLY 

880
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:40,778
FOR THIS VERY STRONG. 

881
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,280
IT CAN'T BE CHARACTERIZED AS 

882
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,150
ANY OTHER THING THAN THAT, VERY 

883
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,118
STRONG SECOND QUARTER GDP 

884
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:47,452
NUMBER. 

885
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,754
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID LOOK, A 

886
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,590
STRONG U.S. ECONOMY IS THE TIME 

887
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,926
TO ASSERT U.S. ECONOMIC 

888
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,027
DOMINANCE WHEN IT COMES TO 

889
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:56,361
TRADE. 

890
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,663
THIS WHITE HOUSE BELIEVES THAT 

891
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,399
A STRONG U.S. ECONOMY IS 

892
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,934
EXACTLY THE RIGHT AND MOST 

893
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,635
ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION TO CARRY 

894
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,038
THIS TRADE ARGUMENT TO EUROPE 

895
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:07,906
AND TO ASIA. 

896
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,741
AND THE PRESIDENT ALSO TOOK 

897
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,343
PAINS TO NOTE A SMALL DECREASE 

898
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,444
BUT A NOTICEABLE DECREASE, $50 

899
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,114
BILLION, IN THE TRADE DEFICIT. 

900
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,450
AND IT IS HIS BELIEF THAT THIS 

901
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,017
TRADE CONFRONTATION WILL 

902
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,753
ULTIMATELY BE RESOLVED AND THE 

903
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,688
TIME TO WAGE THAT CONFRONTATION 

904
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,124
IS WHEN THE U.S. ECONOMY IS 

905
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:26,624
GROWING. 

906
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,858
AND CAN BE RESILIENT AND CAN 

907
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:28,993
TAKE WHAT HE WOULD CHARACTERIZE 

908
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,061
AND MOST OF HIS ECONOMIC 

909
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,931
ADVISORS THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO 

910
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:34,498
CHARACTERIZE AS MOMENTARY 

911
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:35,934
CONFRONTATIONS OVER TRADE THAT 

912
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,468
ARE NOT GOING TO LAST FOR THE 

913
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:37,768
LONG-TERM. 

914
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:40,772
BUT ARE GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT 

915
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,539
DISRUPTIVE BUT IN THE END, 

916
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,075
ACCRUE MORE TO THE BENEFIT OF 

917
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,276
U.S. MANUFACTURERS, FARMERS, 

918
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:45,609
AND THE LIKE. 

919
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:46,978
AND THE TIME TO DO THAT THEY 

920
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,647
ARGUE IS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS 

921
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:49,880
ROBUST. 

922
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,883
WELL, CLEARLY THESE NUMBERS 

923
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,451
SUGGEST A ROBUST ECONOMY. 

924
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,286
WE WILL SEE IF THE PRESIDENT'S 

925
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,054
CALCULUS ABOUT TRADE PROVES TO 

926
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,122
BE CORRECT. 

927
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,724
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU HIS 

928
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:00,792
ECONOMIC TEAM BELIEVES NOW IS 

929
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,694
THE TIME TO WAGE THIS FIGHT AND 

930
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,895
THEY INTEND TO WAGE IT. 

931
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,331
>> YEAH, AND THAT'S A GREAT 

932
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,264
POINT TO MAKE MAJOR. 

933
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,065
WE CAN DISSECT THE NUMBERS AND 

934
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:09,968
WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE 

935
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,803
NUMBERS WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE 

936
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,470
NEXT QUARTER AND THE QUARTERS 

937
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:13,771
AFTER THAT. 

938
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,341
BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT THE U.S. 

939
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,876
ECONOMY IS DOING BETTER THAN IT 

940
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,376
DID IN YEARS PREVIOUS. 

941
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,945
AND THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE 

942
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,747
PRESIDENT, A TESTAMENT TO NOT 

943
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,182
ONLY THE POLICIES THAT HE'S PUT 

944
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,817
INTO PLACE, HE TALKED ABOUT 

945
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,750
DEREGULATION AND HE TALKED 

946
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,019
ABOUT THE -- THE TAX CUTS, BUT 

947
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,189
ALSO THE TEAM THAT HE HAS IN 

948
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:31,422
PLACE. 

949
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,156
HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT 

950
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,324
HE'S GOT SOME OF THE BEST AND 

951
00:31:34,324 --> 00:31:34,725
BRIGHTEST THERE. 

952
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:36,060
>> Reporter: AND ONE THING TO 

953
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,462
KEEP IN MIND, AND I THINK THE 

954
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,097
MOST IMPORTANT OR ONE OF THE 

955
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,798
MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENTS MADE 

956
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,033
CAME RIGHT AT THE END, WHEN THE 

957
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,369
CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL 

958
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,436
ECONOMIC COUNCIL LARRY KUDLOW 

959
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,172
SAID THESE ARE NOT ONE-TIME 

960
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:48,439
NUMBERS. 

961
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,208
THESE NUMBERS AND THE GROWTH 

962
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:50,741
THAT THEY REPRESENT ARE 

963
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,378
SUSTAINABLE FOR AS FAR AS THE 

964
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:53,778
EYE CAN SEE. 

965
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:57,348
OR VERY DEEP INTO THE FUTURE. 

966
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:57,648
ALL RIGHT. 

967
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:58,950
THAT'S THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING 

968
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,785
THIS IS NOT A SUGAR HIGH. 

969
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,022
THIS IS NOT AN ECONOMIC SURGE 

970
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:04,555
THAT CAN'T BE SUSTAINED. 

971
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,958
THAT IS NOW GOING TO BE ONE OF 

972
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,926
THE MEASURING STICKS TO 

973
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,027
EVALUATE THIS ADMINISTRATION 

974
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,261
BETWEEN NOW AND 2020. 

975
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,429
BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED TO SOME 

976
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,030
ECONOMISTS WHO DO LOOK AT THESE 

977
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,466
NUMBERS AND SAY YES, THEY'RE 

978
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:15,799
VERY STRONG. 

979
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,868
THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS SAID 

980
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,070
THEY'RE SO STRONG THAT INTEREST 

981
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,408
RATES CAN BE RAISED TWICE MORE 

982
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:27,812
THIS CALENDAR YEAR. 

983
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,013
AND NOT DEAL A DESTABILIZING 

984
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:29,713
BLOW TO THE ECONOMY. 

985
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:30,047
THAT'S FINE. 

986
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,683
BUT THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE 

987
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,786
ECONOMIC DATA THAT ARE TO OTHER 

988
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,420
ECONOMISTS SOMEWHAT WORRISOME. 

989
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,754
THE FEDERAL DEFICIT KEEPED 

990
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:37,354
RISING IT'S GOING TO BE $1 

991
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:38,856
TRILLION THIS YEAR IN ALL 

992
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,258
LIKELIHOOD OR VERY CLOSE TO IT 

993
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,559
AND POSSIBLY $1 TRILLION FOR 

994
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,161
MANY, MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE. 

995
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:44,862
BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM. 

996
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,664
THAT MEANS HIGHER DEBT SERVICE, 

997
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,200
THAT MEANS LARGER NATIONAL 

998
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,400
DEBT. 

999
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,135
THAT MEANS GOVERNMENT BORROWING 

1000
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,737
CROWDING OUT PRIVATE INVESTMENT 

1001
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,538
BORROWING. 

1002
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,371
THESE TWO THINGS COULD BECOME 

1003
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:56,040
PROBLEMATIC IN THE NOT TOO 

1004
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,175
DISTANT FUTURE. 

1005
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,344
AND GOING BACK TO THE TRADE 

1006
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,244
ISSUE, YES, THERE'S TREMENDOUS 

1007
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,281
CONFIDENCE THAT THIS PRESIDENT 

1008
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:03,848
IS DRIVING THAT ARGUMENT. 

1009
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,616
WILL FORCE ROLL LIES AND -- 

1010
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:06,384
ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES TO TRADE 

1011
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,986
DIFFERENTLY WITH THE UNITED 

1012
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,089
STATES BUT IF THIS BECOMES A 

1013
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,024
TARIFF WAR AND U.S. MARKETS 

1014
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,959
SHRINK AS A RESULT OF THAT, 

1015
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,295
THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE 

1016
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:19,697
EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 

1017
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,264
UNDERMINE THESE NUMBERS. 

1018
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,333
SO WHEN LARRY SAYS ON BEHALF OF 

1019
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,769
THE PRESIDENT WE'RE GOING TO 

1020
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,836
HAVE THIS GREAT ECONOMY, FOR A 

1021
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,772
GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN THE 

1022
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,374
FUTURE, THAT'S NOW A PROMISE. 

1023
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,077
THE PROMISE IS MADE DURING THE 

1024
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:33,911
CAMPAIGN HAVE LARGELY BEEN 

1025
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:34,211
FULFILLED. 

1026
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,813
NOW THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED A NEW 

1027
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,048
BENCHMARK TO MEASURE THIS 

1028
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,749
ECONOMY AND ITS FUTURE 

1029
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:39,082
PERFORMANCE. 

1030
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:40,685
>> MAJOR, JUST I MEAN IF WE ARE 

1031
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,320
ABLE TO TAKE AWAY ALL OF THE -- 

1032
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,122
YOU KNOW, THE THINGS THAT HAVE 

1033
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,591
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF 

1034
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,892
THIS WEEK THAT REALLY MATTER TO 

1035
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,460
AMERICANS, AND IF YOU TAKE AWAY 

1036
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,695
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

1037
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,263
INVESTIGATION, YOU TAKE AWAY 

1038
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,899
MICHAEL COHEN, YOU TAKE AWAY 

1039
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,201
ALL THE NOISE AROUND HELSINKI, 

1040
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,137
THE PRESIDENT HAS ACTUALLY HAD 

1041
00:33:59,137 --> 00:33:59,537
A VERY GOOD WEEK. 

1042
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,873
HE LITERALLY KISSED AND MADE UP 

1043
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,440
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

1044
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,409
HE'S ABLE TO SAY LOOK THE DEAL 

1045
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:09,179
THAT I HAMMERED WITH THE NORTH 

1046
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,614
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN HAS 

1047
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:11,849
RESULTED IN SOMETHING TANGIBLE. 

1048
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,051
TODAY HE CAN TALK ABOUT THE 

1049
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:14,518
STRONG GDP NUMBERS. 

1050
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:16,053
SO IF YOUD IF HA TOISES -- HAD 

1051
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:17,588
TO ASSESS THE PRESIDENT'S WEEK 

1052
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,123
AND TAKE AWAY THAT STUFF WHICH 

1053
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,292
I KNOW YOU REALLY CAN'T. 

1054
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:21,958
BUT LOOKING AT TANGIBLE 

1055
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,694
BENEFITS THAT MOST AMERICANS 

1056
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,695
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY 

1057
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,429
WELL ACTUALLY I CAN SEE THE 

1058
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,764
RESULTS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1059
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:28,466
POLICIES AND HIS ACTIONS, IT'S 

1060
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,867
A GOOD WEEK FOR PRESIDENT 

1061
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:30,501
TRUMP. 

1062
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,135
>> Reporter: WELL, LET'S START 

1063
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:31,702
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

1064
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,304
MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY 

1065
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:33,536
YES. 

1066
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:35,205
THE PRESIDENT CALLED THE 

1067
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:35,472
QUESTION. 

1068
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:35,839
HE MADE NOISE. 

1069
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,908
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION 

1070
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,208
RESPONDED. 

1071
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,409
NOW WE DON'T KNOW THE ULTIMATE 

1072
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,244
RESULT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. 

1073
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,946
BUT THINGS HAVE STEPPED BACK 

1074
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,280
FROM AN ALL-OUT TRADE WAR. 

1075
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,516
AND IF THEY'RE RESOLVED TO THE 

1076
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,217
SATISFACTION OF BOTH PARTIES, 

1077
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,351
THEN THE PRESIDENT BY DRIVING 

1078
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:49,186
THAT HARD BARGAIN WILL HAVE 

1079
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:51,188
SUCCEEDED AND THAT WILL BE A 

1080
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:51,389
WIN. 

1081
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,690
NO ONE IN AMERICA WILL IN ANY 

1082
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,159
WAY CONTEST IT'S NOT IMPORTANT 

1083
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,193
AND NOT HISTORICALLY MEANINGFUL 

1084
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:57,528
TO HAVE REMAINS FROM THE KOREAN 

1085
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,997
WAR RETURNED TO THE UNITED 

1086
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:00,331
STATES. 

1087
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,066
OF COURSE IT'S MEANINGFUL. 

1088
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:02,767
THAT'S A BEGINNING STEP. 

1089
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,668
IT DOESN'T ADDRESS PROMISES 

1090
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,370
FROM THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME ON 

1091
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:06,803
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

1092
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:10,241
BUT IT IS A CONFIDENCE BUILDING 

1093
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:10,508
MANEUVER. 

1094
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,208
NOT AN UNIMPORTANT ONE. 

1095
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:15,046
IT HAD SOME HICCUPS AND MISSED 

1096
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,047
MEETINGS AND SOME 

1097
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:16,580
MISCOMMUNICATIONS BUT IT 

1098
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,282
APPEARS TO BE MOVING IN A 

1099
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:18,782
