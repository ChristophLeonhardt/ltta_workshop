I'm in Old Town Warsaw in a country festival is amazing those children dancing food being sold families out together those sermons taking place in the churches and it it really sort of inspired me actually it made me realize that possibly one of the reasons why the young people are Poland I'll be are so much more patriotic than those in the West is because the traditional family unit is more respected here and so is the Sunday the Sunday that should be spent with families at church celebrating your own history what's what's happened here is the current government is changing legislation so that shops can't operate on Sundays as a westerner I think that would be pretty hard to deal with if I couldn't go out and get I don't know even a jug of milk or something on a Sunday I'd struggle but it's kind of amazing the current legislation stops trading in shops on to Sunday's a month next year it'll be three Sundays a month and the year after that will be for Sunday so they're really trying to embrace family time on a Sunday and I think that's one of the reasons why the youth of Poland are so much more patriotic than those of us in the way near by a young boy and his mum were leaving a church sermon local people knew we were interviewing young people about patriotism and they recommended that I talk to the young boy I was amazed by his knowledge and passion for Poland so hi thank you for talking to me can you tell me how old you are your name and maybe tell me a little bit about the sermon today my name is Anne TAC I'm 10 years old and I came here today because I'm very interested in the Warsaw Uprising and world war two history in general so would you say you're a patriot do you love Poland I like Poland and I would love to go into battle for her but at the same time I hope that it will never have to come so in England a lot of young people don't know that much about their own history and they're not proud of it do you think that's important to be I think so since for example during the Battle of Britain the Polish 303 fighter squadron participated while the Royal Air Force dropped supplies over Warsaw intended for the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising I think that they should know their history so with the history of Poland with the war and even some British history with the war is that a key part of your school curriculum is that what you learn at school I haven't started eighth grade yet which is when they start teaching you about World War two history so I honestly don't know yet so you already know so much is this something your family teaches you outside of school I think that I've become interested in it on my own I was just two years old when I visited the Warsaw Uprising museum for the first time and apparently when I saw the video in which the Germans were raising the city to the ground I would just show boom-boom-boom that's really amazing right so is is this something a lot of your friends are interested in as well yes some of them yes but not all of them many are interested in military equipment but it's primarily the modern gear and not the historical weapons what would you say to young British people who aren't as proud as their history as you are of yours I would tell them that it was them who managed to defend their country from the Germans who never managed to occupy the UK it was them who participated in a majority of the important battles which ultimately led to the defeat of the German well thank you so much nice to meet you without you our media organization simply wouldn't exist I wouldn't be here in Poland bringing you the story about the patriotic Polish youth the story the media simply doesn't want you to know about thank you for your support and if you'd like to support us in this trip to Poland please go to rebel Poland calm if you'd like to help us cover our modest expenses for this trip please go to rebel Poland calm you
