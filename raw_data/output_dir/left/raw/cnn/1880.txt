1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
joining us now to talk about this and
much more the governor of the

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,190
Commonwealth of Virginia Terry McAuliffe
governor good to see you thanks for

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,120
joining us good morning Jake so let's
begin with the president Trump's pardon

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,079
of a sheriff arpaio what do you make the
decision bad decision goes against the

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,340
rule all I can tell you as governor one
of the most important decisions I make

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,900
are those that I pardon I look for folks
who for redemption to be able to go back

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,740
into the workforce and this pardon that
he did had nothing to do with it and I

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,250
do agree with Senator Schumer at a time
right now after we've had

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,270
Charlottesville on other issues it is
time for reconciliation time for healing

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,290
let us bring this country together
president Trump of course continuing to

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,520
face criticism about his response to the
violence in Charlotte all this time in

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,719
his own white house is that National
Economic Council director Gary cone said

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,780
this week to the Financial Times that
the Trump administration quote can and

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,870
must do better and consistently and
unequivocally condemning these groups

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,260
the president said this week that his
response to Charlotte's vote was quote

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,949
perfect and said that the media was
taking his words out of context take a

17
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:09,720
listen the words were perfect they only
take out anything they can think of the

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,210
media can attack me but where I draw the
line is when they attack you which is

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,450
what they do when they attack the
decency of our supporters what's your

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,430
response to that sir well as you know I
came right out after the president spoke

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,450
the president did not say neo-nazis he
did not say white supremacist I came out

22
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,159
immediately and said these neo-nazis
came to Virginia the alt-right came the

23
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,150
white supremists the Klansmen I told him
to get out go home they're not welcome

24
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,600
in our state but be honest with you
their hatred is not welcome in this

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,140
country they pretended they were
Patriots they're not they are cowards

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,079
they came to Virginia armed to harm our
citizens and the point is that these

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,770
people came to do harm
they brought their hatred here it wasn't

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,149
both sides you had there is no moral
equivalent you had one side neo-nazis

29
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,009
who our great country fought against
adolf hitler and white supremists and

30
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,050
Klansmen who's spewing hatred the other
side were counter protesters who were

31
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,770
protesting their hate I just disagree
with the president it was

32
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,650
both sides this was one side hatred
bigotry and bias and there's no place in

33
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,190
this country and he just needs to call
it out for what it is that's how you how

34
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,910
did we get here Jake to this point where
these people spewed this horrible

35
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,410
language and most importantly this is
the key and it isn't about monuments

36
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,610
this is a broader issue about the hatred
and bigotry in our country how do we do

37
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,380
healing how do we do reconciliation and
how do we move forward as a nation

38
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,430
because we need to be united as the
United States of America to compete on a

39
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,240
global basis but everybody and let's
talk about schools today if every

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,590
children get an equal opportunity for a
great education our children being able

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,490
to get a healthy breakfast in the
morning something my wife does here 10

42
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,880
million more breakfasts as last year in
Virginia for needy children these are

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,600
the things we need to focus on governor
while I take your point on moral

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,710
equivalence what do you make of the
counter protesters who are part of a

45
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:15,210
group called an tyfa that actually seek
to confront the Klan and the alt-right

46
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,130
through violent means are they not
problematic when it comes to their

47
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,310
tactics and and what they stand for
yep and let me be crystal clear

48
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,940
everybody's entitled to protest
everybody under the First Amendment but

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,530
it's peaceful protest I was very angry
I've been very public about this that

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,860
the city of Charlottesville who had
control they were in command control

51
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,660
this situation they got a permit to move
it out of downtown Charlottesville

52
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,320
unfortunately sued by the ACLU and then
the judge ruled that stayed in the

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,160
middle of downtown
it was a boiling pot with people armed

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,900
but anyone I don't care which side you
were on Jake if you came to Virginia and

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,580
you committed some act of violence we
are going to come after you and we are

56
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,290
going to arrest you either side
regardless I saw a picture today of a

57
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,670
gentleman with a aerosol can with like a
flamethrower we're gonna we're gonna

58
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,540
track you down now we just arrested
yesterday or put the warrants out for

59
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,850
two individuals one from Maryland one
from Ohio who went after and attacked

60
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,590
DeAndre Harris several individuals
attacked this young man who was a

61
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,000
substitute assistant teacher for special
ed children in heist

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,160
he was visually viciously beaten we are
now going to get to and we're gonna get

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,730
every single individual you commit a
crime of violence I don't care which

64
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,330
side you're on we're gonna come get you
let's talk about the Confederate

65
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,860
monuments cuz you have called for them
to be removed but this is a relatively

66
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,340
new position for you listen to what you
had to say about the Confederate

67
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,300
monuments back here 2015 robert e lee
jefferson davis these are all parts of

68
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,580
our heritage and the people were in that
battle the civil war many a minute

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,840
obviously for their own reasons that
they had for that but leave the statues

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,370
and those things alone leave the statues
and those things alone that's you in

71
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,310
2015 were you wrong then well that was
when i gave that speech is when i had

72
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,140
taken executive action and remove the
Confederate flag from all the license

73
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,820
plates in the Commonwealth of Virginia
it was a very controversial move when I

74
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,890
did it because I said listen this is a
divisive symbol that is on the license

75
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,419
plate and as governor I took executive
action many individuals disagreed with

76
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,250
my action at that time so this was the
first step and now what we've seen after

77
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,390
Charlottesville and around the country
that those statues have very similar

78
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,840
significance to what when I when I took
the Confederate flag off our license

79
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,310
plates they are symbol monuments should
be unifiers they are now symbols of

80
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,450
hatred and I have said let's take them
down I do not have the authority as

81
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,500
governor the local jurisdictions do and
the General Assembly but let's go ahead

82
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,340
and take them down and move forward
earlier this year you were asked if you

83
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,270
wanted to be President you said quote I
don't know I might in the wake of

84
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,960
Charlottesville do you feel even more
motivated to run against President Trump

85
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,940
in 2020 listen I get asked this question
a lot you know I've been very vocal on

86
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,330
the issues you know I'm very proud here
Virginia unemployment went from all the

87
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,260
way from five for the three seven
hundreds of thousands of new jobs record

88
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,550
amount of investment we've made great
progress I get asked this all the time

89
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,940
I'll give you the same answer Jake I
give every single person I am the

90
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,419
governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia
I have five months to go I want to

91
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,430
finish here strong in 18 I'm gonna help
elect we have 38 governors up between

92
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,150
now and November of 2018 and
that's my focus I don't know what's

93
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,250
gonna happen after that but I love this
job I am I'm the taxpayer dime they pay

94
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,550
me to be governor and that's what I
focus on every single day we'll see what

95
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,909
happens down the road but I have no
intentions of running for president my

96
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,590
only intention is to figure and tear
strong I want to get twenty billion of

97
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,550
economic new economic activity I'm at
sixteen and a half I already have the

98
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,030
all-time record I want to take it to the
next level today I'm going out to a

99
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,470
juvenile detention facility one that I'm
shutting down because these two

100
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,210
facilities are outdated I'm very proud
that we are going to build new ones

101
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,900
smaller I've reduced the juvenile
population by two-thirds here in

102
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,090
Virginia I've restored more voting
rights to returning citizens than any

103
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,870
governor in the history of the United
States of America these are the things I

104
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,310
focus on jobs jobs jobs treating
everybody with dignity and respect and

105
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,819
that's why I was so angry at
Charlottesville because these people

106
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,900
came in many of her part of state they
came armed they came to hurt our

107
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,680
citizens and they came to hurt our
reputation but you know what Jake we

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,370
came out of that stronger today the
Commonwealth of Virginia is stronger and

109
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,419
because of their actions we are a
stronger Commonwealth and I'm telling

110
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,009
the president the same thing let us use
this as an opportunity to unite to heal

111
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,690
to reconcile and become clearly a more
stronger country there's a term in

112
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,680
politics Sherman asked a Sherman ask
denial when somebody says you know if I

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,069
will definitely not be President I've
asked I will not serve exactly I think

114
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,930
you just gave the the antonym to Sherman
asked I think McAuliffe asked because

115
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,919
that sounded like an announcement speech
but I appreciate where you're coming

116
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,550
from governor thank you so much for
being here everybody's trying to get

117
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,520
their name in the paper to say they're
running for president I will be very

118
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,940
clear I am the one guy to everybody keep
your name out of the paper I'm not

119
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,379
telling anybody I am finishing up here
strong in the footsteps of many of our

120
00:08:31,379 --> 00:00:00,000
great governors I just want to stand on
their shoulders and help people
