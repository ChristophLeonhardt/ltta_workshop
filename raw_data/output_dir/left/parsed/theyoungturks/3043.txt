ALABAMA'S SPECIAL ELECTION
FOR A NEW SENATOR GAVE US
RESULTS WE WERE HOPING FOR, DOUG
JONES DID BEAT ROY MOORE BY A
SMALL MARGIN,
1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
HOWEVER, ROY MOORE BELIEVES THAT
GAP IS A LITTLE TOO SMALL
AND HE REFUSES TO CONCEDE.
HE'S CALLING FOR A RECOUNT.
LET'S HEAR IT FROM HIM.
>>THANK YOU.
I REALLY WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR COMING TONIGHT AND
REALIZE WHEN THE VOTE IS THIS
CLOSE THAT IT'S NOT OVER, AND WE
STILL GOT TO GO BY THE RULES
ABOUT THIS RECOUNT PROVISION,
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS
EXPLAINED IT TO US, AND WE ARE
EXPECTING THAT THE PRESS WILL GO
UP THERE AND TALK TO THEM TO
FIND OUT WHAT THE SITUATION IS.
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT GOD IS
ALWAYS IN CONTROL.
>>APPARENTLY GOD DECIDED, I
LIKE DOUG JONES A LITTLE BETTER.
I LIKE HIM ABOUT 1.5 POINTS
BETTER THAN I LIKE YOU, ROY.
I
KNOW IT'S A GOOD MOMENT AND A
FUN MOMENT AND A LOT OF THE
PRESS HAS DONE THIS TO RUB IT
INTO ROY MOORE AND SAY SORE
LOSER AND THEY LOVE TO SAY THAT,
I'M NOT IN THAT CAMP.
I LOVE
RECOUNTS, PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THEY
ARE SO EXPENSIVE -- NO THEY
AREN'T. THE MONEY WE LOSE TO
CORRUPT POLITICIANS DOING
GIVEAWAYS TO THEIR DONORS IS 1
BILLION TIMES MORE THAN A SIMPLE
RECOUNT.
IF A RECOUNT IS IN ANY
WAY MERITED I WOULD BE IN FAVOR
OF IT, AND IN THE BEGINNING OF
THE NIGHT WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE
THE MARGIN WAS UNDER ONE POINT,
I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED A
RECOUNT.
IF YOU WON, YOU WON,
IT'S OKAY.
UNLESS THEY THINK
THEY WILL SOMEHOW CHEAT IN A
RECOUNT, BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF THAT, THE SECRETARY OF STATE
WILL WEIGH IN AND A SECOND, BUT
AS IT TURNS OUT IN ALABAMA IF IT
IS WITHIN HALF A POINT YOU HAVE
TO DO A RECOUNT AND THAT'S
GREAT, YOU SHOULD.
I WOULD
SUPPORT A RECOUNT FOR ANYTHING
UNDER A POINT.
AS IT TURNED OUT
THIS WAS 1.5 POINTS, REALLY WELL
OUTSIDE OF THE RULES.
ROY MOORE
SAYS HE RESPECTS THE RULES, HE
GOT KICKED OFF THE ALABAMA
SUPREME COURT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
RESPECT THE RULES, SO IF HE
RESPECTED THE RULES OF ALABAMA
IN THIS CASE HE WOULDN'T
ASK FOR A RECOUNT.
>>EXACTLY, BUT HE IS ASKING FOR
ONE.
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
DISAGREE WITH YOU MORE, I THINK
THE MEDIA SHOULD RUB IT IN HIS
FACE AND I DO ENJOY IT, AND I
INTEND ON CONTINUING TO RUB IT
IN HIS FACE.
THE ALABAMA
SECRETARY OF STATE WAS SPEAKING
TO THE PRESS AFTER ROY MOORE
MADE THOSE STATEMENTS AND I
ENJOYED THIS EXCHANGE, LET'S
TAKE A LISTEN TO JOHN MERRILL.
>>WHAT DO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT THE CONVERSATION THAT WILL
TAKE PLACE WHEN HE ARRIVES?
>>I DON'T KNOW THAT THE JUDGES
COMING HERE, I'M INSPECTING
OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE MEDIA TO
COME HERE, I'M NOT VERY
COMFORTABLE IN VISITING WITH
JUDGE MOORE OR ANYBODY IN
HIS CAMPAIGN TONIGHT.
THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA HAVE
SPOKEN TONIGHT, THEY MADE
THEIR VOICE HEARD LOUD AND
CLEAR.
>>I LOVE THE PART WHERE HE'S
LIKE, NO, PLEASE DON'T COME
HERE.
>>PLEASE DON'T COME TO MY
HOUSE.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS
DAUGHTERS BUT HE'S LIKE, I
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT ROY MOORE
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS HOUSE.
HE
WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE THINKS A
RECOUNT IS UNLIKELY AND THAT A
CHANGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS
UNLIKELY, SO DOUG JONES WILL BE
THE NEXT SENATOR FROM THE GREAT
STATE -- NOW I CAN SAY IT -- THE
GREAT STATE OF ALABAMA.
>>DOUG JONES TOOK A MOMENT TO
THANK THE BLACK COMMUNITY
FOR RALLYING AND SUPPORTING HIM.
>>IT WAS EVERY COMMUNITY.
I KEEP
HEARING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT
COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE.
THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY,
THANK YOU!
>>YES. AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER,
BLACK VOTERS ACCOUNTED FOR 28 OR
29% OF THE ELECTORATE, A
SLIGHTLY HIGHER FIGURE THAN
THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION.
THEY ARE MOTIVATED TO SUPPORT
DOUG JONES, WHO CONVICTED KLAN
MEMBERS WHO MURDERED INNOCENT
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALABAMA,
AND PROBABLY MOTIVATED TO OPPOSE
ROY MOORE, WHO THOUGHT THE 14TH
AMENDMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY.
WHICH IS -- EVERY PART OF ROY
MOORE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
WHO SAYS
THAT?
THAT IS SO INSANE.
THANK
GOD THEY STOOD UP AND GOT
VICTORIES.
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IS, FIGHT, IF YOU FIGHT
YOU WIN.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T
LOSE ENERGY AND THINK YOU CAN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
IN ALABAMA
YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE, AND NOW
THAT MONSTER ROY MOORE LUCKILY
ISN'T GOING TO GO TO THE SENATE,
HOPEFULLY A PROSECUTOR SENDS HIM
TO JAIL BECAUSE THERE IS NO
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON CHILD
MOLESTATION IN ALABAMA.
