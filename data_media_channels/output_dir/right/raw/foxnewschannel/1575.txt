CARTER, LET'S START WITH YOU.

00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:38,879
AND I WANT TO READ ONE OF THE

23
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,949
EMAILS THAT HE SENT TO YOU THAT

24
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,285
WAS RELEASED BY I THINK IT WAS

DAILY CALLER GOT THIS INITIALLY.

26
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,688
DEAR CARTER, I THOUGHT IT RIGHT

27
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:48,389
AS THE SUMMER WEARS ON TO ASK

28
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:51,659
HOW YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR PLANS

29
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:52,193
ARE AT THIS POINT.

30
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:54,228
IT SEEMS ATTENTION HAS SHIFTED A

31
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:56,263
BIT FROM THE COLLUSION

32
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:59,967
INVESTIGATION TO THE CONTEMPT

33
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,869
WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE AND HOW

34
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:05,072
OR IF ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI WILL BE

35
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:06,273
ACCOMMODATED THERE.

I MUST ASSUME THIS GIVES YOU

WE ARE HERE IN VIRGINIA.

BE IN TOUCH IF YOU HAVE THE

40
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:12,379
TIME.

41
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:13,481
WOULD BE GREAT TO CATCH UP.

42
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:14,315
WE ARE NOT MENTIONING THE

43
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:17,618
INFORMANT'S NAME, BUT WHEN DID

44
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:18,819
YOU FIRST MEET THIS INFORMANT

45
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,821
THAT WE NOW KNOW IS AN INFORMANT

46
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,123
AND JUST BRIEFLY TELL US ABOUT

47
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:26,660
THAT EXCHANGE.

48
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,062
>> AGAIN, SIMILAR TO VIEW IN

49
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,530
TERMS OF BEING CAUTIOUS ABOUT

50
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,900
IDENTITY, I HAVE ALSO -- I NEVER

51
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,269
KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PERSON I

52
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:38,806
WAS SPEAKING WITH WHO IS A

53
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,974
UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AT

54
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,009
CAMBRIDGE IN THE U.K. AT THE

55
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,778
TIME.

56
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:45,780
I WAS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN

57
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,550
A CONFERENCE IN JULY OF 2016 AND

58
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,485
EVERYTHING SEEMED TOTALLY

59
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:51,819
NORMAL.

60
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:56,090
AND FRANKLY, I HAVE BEEN FALSELY

61
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,725
ACCUSED MYSELF AND WE WILL SEE

62
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,094
WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF AS

63
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:01,896
FURTHER DETAILS COME OUT.

64
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:02,596
BUT BASED ON EVERYTHING I'VE

65
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:05,599
SEEN THUS FAR, WE STILL DON'T

66
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,669
HAVE ANY INFORMATION.

67
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,402
>> Laura: WE KNOW HE WAS PAID

68
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:11,605
A MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE

69
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:11,906
YEARS.

70
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:19,113
PRETTY GOOD MONEY AS A

71
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:19,747
CONSULTANT, OR RESEARCHER.

72
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:20,247
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT.

73
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:20,681
WE SHALL SEE.

74
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:21,415
BUT QUESTION, BEFORE WE GO ON TO

75
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,249
MICHAEL.

76
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:22,950
WHO STARTED THE CONVERSATION?

77
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,886
HOW DID THE DATE BEGIN?

78
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:27,254
SORRY, DID HE APPROACH YOU, DID

79
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:29,256
HE MENTION RUSSIA COLLUSION

80
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:29,557
FIRST?

81
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:32,560
HOW DID IT GO DOWN?

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,361
>> IT WAS A MULTI-DAY CONFERENCE

83
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:37,464
AND THERE WERE SCHOLARS AND

84
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:38,899
PEOPLE FROM GOVERNMENT BOTH FROM

85
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:39,800
THE UNITED KINGDOM -- JUST

86
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,268
>> Laura: STAY FOCUSED WITH

87
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:41,669
ME.

88
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,671
DID HE APPROACH YOU FIRST?

89
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:44,672
DID YOU APPROACH AND?

90
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,574
HOW DID YOU FIRST START

91
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:46,941
SPEAKING?

92
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,175
>> I DON'T EVEN RECALL.

93
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:50,845
WE SPENT A COUPLE DAYS TOGETHER.

94
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:52,513
>> Laura: A COUPLE DAYS

95
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:52,880
TOGETHER?

96
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,683
>> IT WAS A LONG EVENT OVER

97
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:56,116
SEVERAL DAYS.

98
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:57,384
>> Laura: WHAT I'M SAYING IS

99
00:02:57,384 --> 00:02:59,486
THERE WERE A LOT OF SCHOLARS

100
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:00,254
THERE AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE

101
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:02,690
PROCESS OF GROOMING SOMEONE.

102
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,724
WHEN SOMEONE IS AN INFORMANT

103
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:04,491
THEY DON'T JUST GO UP TO SOMEONE

104
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:07,461
AND SAY HEY, I WANT TO PLANT

105
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,295
INFORMATION ON YOU OR FIND OUT

106
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:09,063
WHAT YOU HAVE.

107
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,998
YOU TRY TO WIN SOMEONE'S TRUST

108
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:11,298
OVER.

109
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,434
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

110
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,436
>> I NEVER FELT GROOMED.

111
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,872
IF HE'S GOOD AT DOING THAT THEN

112
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:20,040
PERHAPS THAT'S PART OF THE GAME.

113
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,410
>> Laura: YOU DON'T KNOW WHO

114
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,379
MENTIONED THE RUSSIA COLLUSION

115
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,247
ISSUE FIRST?

116
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,282
>> I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER.

117
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:29,016
I THINK RUSSIA WAS IN THE NEWS

118
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:33,520
AND I THINK A LOT OF POLITICS

119
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,289
SORT OF REVOLVED AROUND VARIOUS

120
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,391
NEWS EVENTS AND SOLD THESE

121
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,293
VARIOUS STORIES CAME UP.

122
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:40,027
AGAIN, WE STAYED IN TOUCH FOR

123
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:44,398
OVER A YEAR.

124
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,533
>> Laura: LOOKING BACK, I'M

125
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,868
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

126
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:48,535
LIMITED TIME.

127
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:49,503
I'M LOOKING BACK ON IT, DOES

128
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:52,673
ANYTHING SEEM ODD OR -- YOU KNOW

129
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,841
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THEN, MAYBE

130
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:57,344
THAT WAS A LITTLE ODD, OR ANY

131
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:59,179
OTHER CONTACTS HAD WITH ANY

132
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,314
OTHER PEOPLE THAT SEEM NOW IN

133
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,483
RETROSPECT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW

134
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:05,953
NOW ODD, OUT OF THE ORDINARY OR

135
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:09,890
MAYBE IN SOME WAY IMPROPER?

136
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,591
>> I TEND TO GIVE PEOPLE THE

137
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:13,694
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

138
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:16,096
WE WILL SEE.

139
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,964
MAYBE THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO WE ARE

140
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:18,933
TALKING ABOUT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

141
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:23,070
LITTLE BIT NICER THAN I MIGHT

142
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,040
OTHERWISE HAVE EXPECTED.

143
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,807
ALTHOUGH, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

144
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:29,777
ALL OF THE ABUSES THAT WERE

145
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:32,079
HAPPENING WITH THIS DODGY

146
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,914
DOSSIER WHICH WAS FIRST DEBUTED

147
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,684
IN SEPTEMBER 2016 AS A WAY OF

148
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:38,018
DAMAGING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

149
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:40,888
BASICALLY DESTROYING MYSELF, AND

150
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:41,755
SO HE ALWAYS SEEMED VERY

151
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:43,657
SYMPATHETIC ABOUT THAT.

152
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:45,893
AGAIN, WE'LL SEE.

153
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,294
I LIKE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE

154
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:47,861
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

155
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,898
PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM IN

156
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:52,266
WASHINGTON AND SENIOR CIRCLES

157
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,268
THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH

158
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:55,636
AFTERWARDS SAY HE SEEMED LIKE A

159
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:58,872
PRETTY DECENT GUY.

160
00:04:58,872 --> 00:04:59,807
>> Laura: THAT WOULD BE THE

161
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:02,543
PERFECT PERSON TO USE.

162
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:03,677
MAYBE I'M JUST CYNICAL, BEEN

163
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,679
AROUND WASHINGTON TOO LONG.

164
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,780
IF ONLY THEY GAVE YOU THE

165
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,581
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT LIKE YOU

166
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:08,515
ARE GIVING OTHER PEOPLE THE

167
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:09,350
BENEFIT OF THAT OUT.

168
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,018
MICHAEL, LET'S GO TO YOU.

169
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,786
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THE

170
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,788
MEAT GRINDER AT THE MUELLER

171
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,523
INVESTIGATION.

172
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:17,758
HE HAS ALL THESE REALLY HIGHLY

173
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:20,694
SKILLED INTERVIEWERS,

174
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:21,428
PROSECUTORS ON HIS SIDE.

175
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:25,099
MANY OF THEM, NOT ALL OF THEM I

176
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,100
BELIEVE HAVE A BUILT-IN ANIMUS

177
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,068
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

178
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:30,004
YOU ARE VERY ANGRY THAT YOU HAVE

179
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,071
BEEN DRAGGED INTO THIS AS A

180
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:32,373
FORMER ASSOCIATE OF ROGER STONE.

181
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,107
YOU ALSO DID SOME WORK FOR THE

182
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:34,475
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

183
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:35,542
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK.

184
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:38,979
YOU JUST HEARD WHAT CARTER SAID

185
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:39,713
ABOUT THIS REPORTED INFORMANT

186
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:42,883
FOR THE FBI.

187
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:43,884
>> I THINK CARTER HAS BEEN

188
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:44,885
THROUGH MORE OF A MEAT GRINDER

189
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:45,686
THAT I HAVE IT HE HAS HANDLED IT

190
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,955
AS A GENTLEMAN.

191
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:51,492
IN FACT, WHEN I FIRST HEARD

192
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,161
ABOUT THE STUFF I THINK IN 2016

193
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:54,928
ABOUT CARTER I WASN'T VERY KIND

194
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,431
IN MY CRITICISM AND IT LOOKS

195
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:59,500
LIKE THEY WERE REALLY ABUSING

196
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,833
CARTER.

197
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,135
I THINK THEY WERE REALLY

198
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:02,036
TREATING HIM POORLY AND I THINK

199
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,104
A LOT OF US OWE CARTER AN

200
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:05,339
APOLOGY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WAIT

201
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,106
TO HEAR THE TRUTH AT THE END AND

202
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:10,110
NOW WE ARE FINDING OUT THAT HIS

203
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,011
COUNTRY WAS REALLY FAILING HIM

204
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:14,081
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND EVEN

205
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:14,381
YEARS.

206
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:15,482
I'M ANGRY, I'M SURPRISED THAT

207
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:16,683
CARTER IS NOT.

208
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:19,620
HE'S A GREATER MAN THAN I.

209
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,688
THIS IS REALLY SICK AND TWISTED

210
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:22,089
STUFF.

211
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,757
AND LIKE CARTER SAID, THIS

212
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:26,093
GENTLEMAN WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED

213
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,829
HAS A REPUTATION OF BEING VERY

214
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,564
PRO-AMERICAN, VERY PATRIOTIC AND

215
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,800
IF, IN FACT, HE WAS BROUGHT INTO

216
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,534
THIS UNDER FALSE CIRCUMSTANCES

217
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,835
OR FALSE PRETENSES AS WELL IS

218
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,804
THE KIND OF GUY THAT A DEEP

219
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:40,974
STATE WOULD TARGET.

220
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:44,078
>> Laura: THE DOSSIER WAS THE

221
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:45,112
BASIS FOR GETTING THIS FISA WAR.

222
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,513
I DON'T CARE WHAT THESE PEOPLE

223
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:46,780
SAY.

224
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,516
IT WAS ALL A BIG LIE.

225
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:50,350
WITHOUT THIS DOSSIER CARTER PAGE

226
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,219
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURVEILLED

227
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:53,720
IN THE FALL OF 2016.

228
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,421
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

229
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,222
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE RUNNING TO

230
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:58,325
THAT RUSSIAN OLIGARCH TO TRY TO

231
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,093
GET HIM INVOLVED.

232
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:01,095
HE IS LIKE I DON'T EVEN LIKE

233
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,129
PAUL MANAFORT, THIS IS

234
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:02,696
RIDICULOUS.

235
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:03,730
THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY

236
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,098
COULD.

237
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:05,599
THEY WERE WORKING THE PAGE

238
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,166
ANGLE.

239
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,135
THEY PROBABLY WERE WORKING THIS

240
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,336
INFORMANT ANGLE AND THEY BROUGHT

241
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:10,537
YOU IN, MICHAEL, WHICH WE WILL

242
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:11,505
GET YOU IN A MOMENT.

243
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:13,707
BUT I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU WHAT

244
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:15,109
SALLY ASKED, ACTING

245
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,743
ATTORNEY GENERAL AT THE VERY

246
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:17,311
BEGINNING OF THE TRUMP

247
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,011
ADMINISTRATION, SHE'S THE ONE

248
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:19,546
WHO WAS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

249
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:20,247
INTERVIEWING MICHAEL FLYNN AT

250
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:21,715
THE BEGINNING, WHAT SHE SAID

251
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:22,483
TODAY ON MORNING JOE.

252
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,917
LET'S WATCH.

253
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,319
>> I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING

254
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,421
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST

255
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:32,626
TAKEN HIS OUT OF SALT      ALL-O

256
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:32,659
TAKEN HIS OUT OF SALT      ALL-T

257
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:32,693
TAKEN HIS OUT OF SALT      ALL-A

258
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:32,726
TAKEN HIS OUT OF SALT      ALL-S

259
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:32,759
TAKEN HIS OUT OF SALT      ALL-U

260
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:32,993
TAKEN HIS OUT OF SALT      ALL-T

261
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,395
ON THE NEW LAW TO A NEW LEVEL IN

262
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:39,333
THIS TIME RESULT ORDERING AN

263
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,100
INVESTIGATION OF THE

264
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,868
INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE EXAMINING

265
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:41,368
HIS OWN CAMPAIGN.

266
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:43,737
THAT'S REALLY SHOCKING.

267
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:45,506
ROD ROSENSTEIN IS TRYING TO

268
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,007
STRIKE A BALANCE HERE BETWEEN

269
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,742
DIFFUSING THE SITUATION, BUT

270
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:49,943
ALSO PROTECTING THE RULE OF LAW

271
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:50,811
AND THE INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY

272
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,913
OF THE DEPARTMENT.

273
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,281
>> Laura: CARTER PAGE, AS I

274
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:57,718
POINTED OUT IN THE OPENING

275
00:07:57,718 --> 00:07:58,685
"ANGLE," THE GOVERNMENT UNDER

276
00:07:58,685 --> 00:07:59,620
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS

277
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,522
SURVEILLED PEOPLE AND LIED ABOUT

278
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,523
IT.

279
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,724
AND WHETHER IT WAS CLAPPER,

280
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:07,895
WHETHER IT WAS THE FBI UNDER

281
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:08,629
HOLDER SURVEILLING JOURNALISTS,

282
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,365
THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF HAVING A

283
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,100
PROBLEM TELLING THE TRUTH ON

284
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,500
SURVEILLING.

285
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,201
SO FOR SALLY ASKED TO RUN OUT

286
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,069
THERE AND SAY DONALD TRUMP IS

287
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,304
ATTACKING THE RULE OF LAW, COME

288
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:17,571
ON.

289
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:21,074
YOUR REACTION?

290
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,277
>> JUST GOING TO MICHAEL'S POINT

291
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,279
ABOUT THINGS THEY DID TO ME,

292
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:25,946
PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING THE

293
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:26,680
CAMPAIGN WOULD OFTEN SAY THIS IS

294
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,149
NOT ABOUT ME, THIS IS ABOUT US

295
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,820
AND I THINK OF ALL OF OF THE

296
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,587
TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO

297
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:35,389
SO MANY PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL,

298
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,625
SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO

299
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,760
WERE INVOLVED ALLEGEDLY WITH

300
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,929
THIS INFORMANT, I ACTUALLY SPOKE

301
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,699
VERY POSITIVELY.

302
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,934
I GOT A POSITIVE IMPRESSION

303
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,835
ABOUT THIS INFORMANT.

304
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:50,170
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE I MENTIONED

305
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,540
HIM TO IN THE CAMPAIGN, I WAS

306
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,343
PRETTY POSITIVE ENDORSEMENT.

307
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:57,678
I HOPE AND PRAY THAT ALL THESE

308
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,880
ALLEGATIONS TURN OUT TO BE FALSE

309
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,415
AND PART OF WHY I'M SOMEWHAT

310
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,616
OPEN ABOUT MY COMMUNICATIONS

311
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:10,557
WITH HIM IS THAT IT WILL LEAD TO

312
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:11,225
SOME TRUTH FINALLY FROM THE

313
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:11,792
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

314
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:12,526
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR DOJ TO OWN

315
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:13,493
UP TO THESE THINGS AND IT'S

316
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:16,897
FUNNY, THE DEFAMATION SUIT I

317
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:18,899
HAVE AGAINST A TOP MEDIA

318
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,400
ORGANIZATION AND DOJ, THE MEDIA

319
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,269
ORGANIZATION IS ACTUALLY MUCH

320
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,403
MORE HONEST THAN THE FALSE

321
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:25,806
PLEADINGS BY THE DOJ SO FAR.

322
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:28,108
>> Laura: WE GOT TO PLAY THIS

323
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,943
JAMES CLAPPER FOR MICHAEL.

324
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,512
HE'S BASICALLY JUST JUSTIFYING

325
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:35,115
THE USE OF ANY TYPE OF INFORMANT

326
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:35,415
HERE.

327
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,683
LET'S WATCH.

328
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:38,785
>> THE FOCUS HERE, AS IT WAS

329
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:39,720
WITH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

330
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,888
IS NOT ON THE CAMPAIGN PER SE,

331
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:44,691
BUT WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE DOING

332
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,293
TO TRY TO INSTANTIATE THEMSELVES

333
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:47,060
IN THE CAMPAIGN OR TO INFLUENCE

334
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,262
OR LEVERAGE IT.

335
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:50,497
SO IF THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT WAS

336
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:53,133
OBSERVING THAT SORT OF THING,

337
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,969
THAT'S A GOOD THING, BECAUSE THE

338
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,772
RUSSIANS POSE A THREAT TO THE

339
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,041
VERY BASIS OF OUR POLITICAL

340
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:01,608
SYSTEM.

341
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,309
>> Laura: MICHAEL.

342
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,144
DO YOU SEE A PATTERN HERE?

343
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:07,314
FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

344
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:09,149
OFFICIAL JUSTIFYING SPYING ON,

345
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:09,883
SURVEILLING, WHATEVER YOU WANT

346
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:12,686
TO CALL IT, PUTTING THEM ALL IN

347
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:15,455
ON AN OPPOSING CAMPAIGN IN A

348
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:18,825
HOTLY CONTESTED ELECTION, FINAL

349
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,093
THOUGHT.

350
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,695
>> YOU HAVE SPENT TIME IN

351
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:22,996
RUSSIA, CARTER AND I BOTH HAVE.

352
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,832
IN RUSSIA THEY CALL THIS THE

353
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,868
NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERSHIP

354
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:31,104
THAT SECRETLY SPIES ON THE

355
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:31,838
CITIZENRY OF RUSSIA AND HERE WE

356
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:35,042
ARE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH

357
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,743
OUR OWN UNDERNEATH

358
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:37,210
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

359
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,978
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT I

360
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:40,280
KNOW FOR A FACT.

361
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,115
THIS INFORMANT, THIS PERSON THAT

362
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,117
THEY PLANTED, TRY TO PLANT INTO

363
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,286
THE CAMPAIGN AND EVEN INTO THE

364
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:46,987
ADMINISTRATION IF YOU BELIEVE

365
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,289
AXIOS, HE'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON

366
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,223
THAT CAME AT THE CAMPAIGN AND

367
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:52,125
THE FBI IS NOT THE ONLY OBAMA

368
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,727
AGENCY THAT CAME AT THE

369
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:54,094
CAMPAIGN.

370
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,329
I KNOW BECAUSE THEY CAME AT ME

371
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:56,663
AND I'M LOOKING FOR CLEARANCE

372
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,098
FROM MY ATTORNEY TO REVEAL THIS

373
00:10:58,098 --> 00:10:59,099
TO THE PUBLIC.

374
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,500
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

375
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,302
AND I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN WE

376
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:05,706
