well hot damn where's it from I think I would expect a bit more body for it okie quite acidic soft with lots of ripe fruit flavours my guess retail price you're looking for about 25 quid 15 feet and 10 pounds per bottle okay number two one to me felt like more of a complete wine it is more complex than the previous bit more fruit driven in the last one I feel like again it's a bit young around 12 to 15 quid maybe 12 pounds 1612 around 12 pounds okay 18 pounds is a fair price for it I would say two for pound fifty I mean me even then that's a good deal hot damn by the front I would enjoy drinking it more than the first one oh wow definitely a bacon
