GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:10,887
CONTINUE TO COME TO LIGHT WHEN

4
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:12,222
IT COMES TO THE KILLINGS AT

5
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:16,024
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN PARKLAND,

6
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:16,359
FLORIDA.

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,761
PARAMEDICS REVEALING THEY TRIED

8
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:22,966
TO GET INTO BUILDINGS SIX TIMES

9
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,969
BUT WERE HELD BACK BY THE

10
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:27,103
BROWARD SHERIFF'S OFFICE, DURING

11
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:28,638
THE CRUCIAL MINUTES WHEN

12
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:29,339
STUDENTS' LIVES MAY HAVE BEEN

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:29,639
SAVED.

14
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,040
THIS COMES DAYS BEFORE THE

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,143
SENIORS THERE WILL RECEIVE THEIR

16
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:34,144
DIPLOMAS, AND THEY ALL HAVE

17
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:35,378
STORIES TO TELL.

18
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:38,181
WE WENT DOWN TO STONEMAN DOUGLAS

19
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:41,217
AND TALKED TO TWO YOUNG WOMEN

20
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:43,820
WHO LOST THEIR BEST FRIEND,

21
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,287
MEADOW POLLACK.

22
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,256
>> FEBRUARY 14th, I WAS ON THE

23
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:47,824
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SCHOOL.

24
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:50,026
I WAS IN MY LAW CLASS, AND WE

25
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,128
WERE ACTUALLY STUDYING A CASE

26
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:56,900
LIKE THIS, ALL THIS STUFF.

27
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,669
THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF.

28
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:00,503
WE ACTUALLY EVACUATED THE

29
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:00,837
SCHOOL.

30
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:02,739
>> I WAS IN MATH CLASS.

31
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,174
I RAN OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.

32
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,442
THEY TOLD US TO KEEP ON GOING

33
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,311
STRAIGHT OUT OF, TO GO TOWARD

34
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:08,912
THE STREET.

35
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:11,281
>> I TEXTED MY MOM.

36
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,184
I LOOK BACK AT IT, "I THINK

37
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:16,486
SOMETHING IS WRONG, FIRE ALARM,"

38
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:18,822
AND IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND

39
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:19,122
WORSE.

40
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:19,622
IT WAS SO UNREAL.

41
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,624
>> A FRANTIC SEEN OUTSIDE OF A

42
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:23,560
FLORIDA HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

43
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,461
A MAJOR POLICE RESPONSE OUTSIDE

44
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,964
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH IN THE

45
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:28,631
TOWN OF PARKLAND.

46

>> IT'S A BAD DREAM YOU WANT TO

47
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:30,433
WAKE UP FROM.

48
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,504
>> I HEARD LOUD GUNSHOTS, BUT I

49
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:35,872
LIKE NO ONE EVER THOUGHT THIS

50
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:36,673
WOULD HAPPEN AT DOUGLAS.

51
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:43,947
>> I HAD TO GO AND TALK TO THE

52
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:44,214
FBI.

53
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:46,783
I WAS ON WITH THE PHONE WITH MY

54
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:48,785
MOM TRYING TO FIND MEADOW, AND

55
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:51,120
HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND ME.

56
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,921
>> STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL

57
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,723
HAS BEEN UNDER LOCKDOWN AFTER

58
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,358
REPORTS OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER

59
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:55,725
SITUATION.

60
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,560
>> I ACTUALLY WASN'T GETTING

61
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,196
MEADOW TO ANSWER MY CALLS.

62
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:01,397
I WAS FREAKING OUT.

63
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:02,465
SHE WASN'T ANSWERING.

64
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,299
I KNEW MEADOW.

65
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,701
SHE'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST

66
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,402
PEOPLE I KNOW, THAT NOTHING

67
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:09,138
WOULD EVER HAPPEN TO HER.

68
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:10,907
I TRACKED HER PHONE, AND IT WAS

69
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,175
AT DOUGLAS.

70
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,043
I EXPECTED THE WORST.

71
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,879
I CALLED EVERY SINGLE PERSON I

72
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,346
KNEW.

73
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,014
THE ONLY PERSON I DIDN'T HEAR

74
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:18,815
FROM WAS MEADOW.

75
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:21,084
>> SHE WILL ALWAYS BE THE

76
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:23,186
STRONGEST PERSON I KNOW.

77
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,821
THERE WAS NO WAY SHE'D GO

78
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:25,521
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

79
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,522
>> INSIDE A FLORIDA HIGH SCHOOL

80
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,258
AS AN EXPELLED FORMER STUDENT

81
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:29,959
UNLEASHED A KILLING SPREE.

82
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,763
AT LEAST 217

83
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:33,796
AT LEAST 117

AT LEAST 177

85
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:35,164
AT LEAST 17 PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

86
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:36,499
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MOVE

87
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:37,667
FORWARD FROM IT.

88
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:41,137
MEADOW WOULD SAY, CARLY, KEEP

89
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,472
GOING, KEEP GOING, DON'T GIVE

90
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:42,739
UP.

91
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:46,643
>> SEEING THE PEOPLE, EVEN

92
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:50,280
PEOPLE I DIDN'T LIKE, IN THE

93
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,781
SAME SITUATION AS ME, HAVING TO

94
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,217
SIT THERE AND DO ALL OF THAT, I

95
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,019
LOOKED AT THEM AND WE HUGGED.

96
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,221
THERE WAS NO HATE ANYMORE.

97
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,656
THERE WAS NOTHING.

98
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:02,158
WE CRIED TOGETHER, SAT THERE

99
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:02,525
TOGETHER.

100
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,094
IT SHOWED ME, WOW, WE'RE FINALLY

101
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:05,962
COMING TOGETHER.

102
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:08,331
IT'S SO SAD IT TO BE OVER THIS,

103
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:13,269
BUT IT'S HELPED US OUT, ALL OF

104
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:14,304
THIS A LOT.

105
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,838
>> WE'RE HERE FOR EACH OTHER.

106
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,341
>> GRADUATION WILL BE THE

107
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:18,675
HARDEST.

108
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,677
PROM WAS HARD, BUT GRADUATION

109
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:22,612
WAS MEADOW'S THING, WALKING THAT

110
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:22,912
STAGE.

111
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,580
I WILL BE PUTTING ON MY CAP,

112
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,883
LIKE A PICTURE OF HER, TO MAKE

113
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,484
SHE'S WALKING THAT STAGE WITH

114
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,119
HER, BECAUSE THIS IS HER BIG

115
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:30,520
DAY.

116
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,121
IT'S BOTH OUR BIG DAYS.

117
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,123
SHE WILL BE THERE WITH US.

118
00:03:34,123 --> 00:03:35,858
>> I'M DOING MY CAP WITH MEADOW,

119
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:39,095
WITH A PICTURE OF HER, AND SO

120
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,763
WHEN I LOOK UP I SEE YOU.

121
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:44,400
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TATTOO

122
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,837
TOGETHER THAT ME AND CARLY GOT

123
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:48,604
TOGETHER.

124
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,641
WE SWORE WE'D NEVER GET A

125
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:51,975
TATTOO.

126
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:54,277
IT'S ON OUR LEFT ANKLE SO HE CAN

127
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,378
WALK THE STAGE WITH US.

128
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:57,814
>> NOTHING WILL BE NORMAL, BUT

129
00:03:57,814 --> 00:03:59,248
EVERYONE BEING TOGETHER AS A

130
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,217
TEAM IS COMPLETELY NEEDED.

131
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:03,252
EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE TOGETHER IF

132
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:04,921
WE DON'T HAVE EACH OTHER, WE'LL

133
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,023
NEVER GET THROUGH THIS, NEVER

134
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:07,557
FIX IT.

135
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:09,292
>> REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW THE

136
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,694
SCHOOL HAS COME TOGETHER, BEEN

137
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,930
THERE FOR EACH OTHER WHEN WE

138
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,697
NEED EACH OTHER THE MOST.

139
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,500
>> THERE'S NO STOPPING.

140
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,101
LIFE KEEPS GOING ON.

141
00:04:19,101 --> 00:00:00,000
LIVE IT FOR HER.
