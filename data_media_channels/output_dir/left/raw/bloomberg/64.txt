1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,480
You may have seen a few of these pop up on
your phone or in your email.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,290
Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Square,
GoDaddy, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, H&M, and many

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,120
more are updating their policies to give consumers
more control over their personal data.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,070
Those updates and changes are thanks to a
new law governing data privacy called the

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,789
General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:28,310
The catch is, GDPR only applies to people
who live in the European Union.. but its adoption

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,999
is largely expected to have Americans asking
“Why don’t we have that?”

8
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,690
Here’s how data collection currently works
-- when you sign up for, let’s say Facebook,

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,870
you have to click a box agreeing to the companies
terms.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,900
Those terms give Facebook the right to track
your online activities, even if you’re not

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,830
actively browsing facebook.

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,180
Facebook can let third parties access it in
order to sell ads and services.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,180
GDPR is changing that.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,540
Consumers will have the right to ask for copies
of anything as basic as messages sent to them,

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,540
or by them…

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,870
That’s Bloomberg Tech Editor Nate Lanxon

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,110
up to entire archives of all the content they've
generated on a service.

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,200
Come May 25 companies with more than 250 employees
and that hold data on European citizens will

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,220
have to get “unambiguous” consent from
users to collect their data, instead of just

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,710
burying an OK inside fine print.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,100
It will also make it much easier to revoke
consent users had previously given.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,640
For consumers that opt in, they have a right
to know what’s being done with their data

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,549
and
instead of being charged to obtain it, can

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,880
request a free copy.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,950
For companies like Google and Facebook, . They've
been making data available for download and

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,920
deletion upon request for quite some time.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,159
Consumers also have the “right to be forgotten,”
which lets citizens request that organizations

28
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,619
delete their data.

29
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,659
Data Portability will give consumers the right
to retrieve their data and sell it to other

30
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:41,659
companies.

31
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,209
So, for example, you may be able to trade
something like a gift certificate from Zara

32
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:47,810
in exchange for your shopping history at J
Crew.

33
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,659
If a firm has a data breach, companies must
notify the authorities within 72 hours.

34
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,509
And any failure to comply with the law will
be costly.

35
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,270
Penalty fines can abe as high as 4 percent
of a company’s global annual revenue.

36
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,270
That means a company like Google could be
fined more than $4 billion for failing to

37
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,270
comply.

38
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,420
Europe expects companies to try and act within
the spirit of the law, and not just try to

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,080
follow it to the letter.This mean there will
be disputes and legal precedence to be set

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
over the coming years.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,470
So while the US is still reeling over Facebook
and the Cambridge Analytica scandal -- The

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,140
EU is moving ahead with tough new rules.

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Many will ask if the US should be next.
