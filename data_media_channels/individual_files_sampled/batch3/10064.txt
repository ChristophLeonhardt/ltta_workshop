the Russian Foreign Minister has met with North Korean leader Kim jong-un as Pyongyang prepares for a possible historic peace summit with South Korea and the United States RT gained exclusive access to Kim's palace our very own correspondent Aleppo tronca was the only international correspondent to be allowed in there he's just landed back in Moscow sounds like it was a fascinating and really quite an exclusive opportunity for you take us through it Neal hello well I spent an hour and a half at Kim Jong Un's palace in Pyongyang with my camera without being told what to do so what more can I add it was a really long story a true thriller of how we ended up there I'm gonna tell you the whole thing it is unbelievable first the Russian Foreign Ministry officials were telling us that the top meeting as they were calling it was likely to happen but we were told for sure that nobody will be invited to see the actual talks between mr. Kim and mr. Lavrov then the actual summit was confirmed but again no journalists were gonna be allowed there but then suddenly at the last moment we got a tip-off from these foreign ministry officials that I can take my camera and come it was a long journey where we're following a black Mercedes along the streets of Pyongyang and then we realized that we ended up in a completely deserted area where there were no cars on the streets or people and then I saw this big palace we have loads of exclusive pictures for you that we'll be showing you later on we seem to get into the palace through some kind of backdoor gates and only then I was able to realize that this is the actual villa and Kim was waiting behind the wooden doors that I saw there sergey lavrov arrived in a few moments and all kinds of interactions between the Russian Foreign Minister and the North Korean leader there of course Prussia's to watch I just want to share one of the moments with you it's a third time in Pyongyang isn't it yes it's my third time and I must say Pyongyang is only getting better again nobody around us was speaking Russian or English I don't speak Korean so we couldn't really understand where these people were taking us but I guess the moment when I realized that this is definitely the Palace the official residence of kim jeong-hoon is when I saw Kim's sister she was trying to sneak out through the doors she was someone who are recognized from the Olympics in Jung Chang in South Korea we remember how she went to South Korea for that event and again this was when I thought okay now here I am and I'm just going to see Kim in a few moments and I even said hello to Kim's sister here's what that particular moment looked like hello now that was Kim Jong Un's sister so really unprecedented axis I guess I believe that no international journalists were able to film in that location for such a long time I saw the sweets all kinds of things that usually people get treated to there it was really incredible to watch Kim sitting alone at one side of the negotiating table he was only accompanied by the translator and then seven members of the Russian delegation of the other side we're going to be showing you all that exclusive footage in the next hours and on Friday as well but I can tell you that it was a long day for me in North Korea where we did many other things before this jewel happened to us before we were able to get inside Kim Jong Un's palace so just have a look at the rest of my stay in North Korea so these are our first steps in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea so sergey lavrov limo just departed and we're going to follow him right now we just left the airport and we're trying to catch up with sergey lavrov limo but we seem to be a bit far behind we're on the way to the capital Pyongyang this is a truly incredible opportunity for us to film inside the place where most high-profile meetings and North Korea happened just as the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is talking to his North Korean counterpart behind closed doors right there the moment when the Russian top diplomat is MPN Jang is absolutely unique on the one hand the resolution of the Korean Peninsula crisis might be just a few steps away with the massive concessions the north and the south have both been making and even Donald Trump - however we understand that any wrong move can make everything collapse so the question is why exactly sergey lavrov ended up in deep North Korean capital Russian diplomatic sources suggests that it was after several invitations in a row by mr. Lavrov counterpart during his visit to Moscow we were also told that the North Korean side wanted the trip to happen ASAP during a traditional quick chat with the journalists on the plane when we asked Sergey Lavrov why this was happening and what to expect of the visit his answer was we'll just have to see I don't know for now you
