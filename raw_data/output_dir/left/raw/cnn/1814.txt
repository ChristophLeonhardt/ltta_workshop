1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,620
I think the government's not a great job
I think the better government working

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,590
with state and local has really done a
terrific job now the keys are in we've

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,689
just got word on the keys that was just
wiped out that got it was a hurricane

4
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,920
drivin it but we're getting in
tremendous amounts of supplies and

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,109
medical and a lot of other things after
the keys but most for the most part the

6
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,780
electric is going back on it's already
on it certifications like by a B but

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,120
it's going back on on a daily basis we
have masses massive amounts of

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,500
electricians massive amounts of
electrical workers all over the state

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,180
they came from all over the country and
came from Canada's as far away as Canada

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,090
there's never been a globalization of
electrical workers like we have in the

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,320
state of Florida and it's going on very
rapidly much of it is already on

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,380
I'll be going to the Virgin Islands this
next week as you know is United Nations

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,030
and I'm going to be going to the murder
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico sometime

14
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,280
at the end of next week or the following
week I spoke to both governor's we've

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,729
got it very well covered Virgin Islands
was really hit they were hit like about

16
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,650
as hard as I've ever seen but the Virgin
Islands were hit but I'll be going there

17
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,180
at the end of the week or the beginning
of the following week I shall also be

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:49,030
wondering who the same makes in United
Nations the review of what about well

19
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,929
you'll see what I'm going to be doing
verse you are clear October but I will

20
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:57,759
say this the Iran deal is one of the
worst deals I've ever seen certainly at

21
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,190
a minimum the spirit of the deal is just
atrociously kept but the Iran deal is

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,780
not
is not a fair deal to this country it's

23
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,970
a deal that should have never ever been
made and you'll see what we're doing in

24
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,250
a couple of weeks is going to be it's
going to be an octo we're going to see

25
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,410
you're going to see what we are not
going to stand for what they're doing to

26
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,810
this country they have violated so many
different elements but they've also

27
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,540
violated the spirit of that deal and you
will see what we'll be doing in October

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,570
it will be very evident from the
Republicans

29
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,069
many Republicans really like it as you
know I was with a great Republican

30
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,680
representative just now who you know
very well and two of them and they are

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,959
very very happy with what I'm doing and
I'm a Republican through and through but

32
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,739
I'm also finding that sometimes to get
things through it's not working that way

33
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:07,310
and you know we got very poorly treated
on the health care plan and now you see

34
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,720
what's happening where people are going
single-payer exactly what I said would

35
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,170
happen and single payer would be a
terrible thing for our country so I am

36
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,320
look my relationship with the
Republicans is excellent many of them

37
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,000
agree with what I'm doing
you just since or to Mario you know I'm

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,520
talking about
we just met with two great Republican

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,370
representatives who love what I'm doing
but we have to get things passed and if

40
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,030
we can't get things passed that we have
to go a different route but we have to

41
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,230
get things passed now you've covered my
statement very accurately on the dinner

42
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,320
last night hat
you know they cannot obstruct for a

43
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,610
while because we definitely need a wall
I just felt by the way to the President

44
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,020
of Mexico and as you know it's been
impossible to reach him because of the

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,060
he was in the mountains where they had
the earthquake it was new cell we spoke

46
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,010
yesterday but the phone the connection
never got put together because he had no

47
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:13,030
access to cell but we just had a good
call just got finished with him had that

48
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,829
whole earthquake is terrible it's just
her so we paid our respect and he

49
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:24,750
likewise also paid his respects with
respect to her Mahendra

50
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,150
I don't know anything about it I just
heard about it I doubt he would do I've

51
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,380
known him a long time he is a very
straight shooter so it could be that he

52
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,680
is too plain that he's paying for it I
don't know anything about it I really

53
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,320
don't I just heard about it total
confidence I know for a long time is a

54
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,970
very honorable man I have confidence in
Gary

55
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,410
gallica bekulistan or their the question
about the way

56
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,550
yeah they were and we had a great
meeting Tim Scott's been a friend of

57
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,000
mine for a long time I've been a
supporter of his when I was a civilian I

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,060
was one of his earliest supporters and I
supported him when he ran and we had a

59
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:32,200
great talk yesterday I think especially
in light of the advent of Antipa if you

60
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,950
look at what's going on there you know
you have some pretty bad dudes on the

61
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,750
other side also and essentially that's
what I said now because of what's

62
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,550
happened since then with that deep you
look at you know really what's happened

63
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,630
since Charlottesville
a lot of people are saying in fact a lot

64
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,010
of people have actually written key
Trump might have a point I said you got

65
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,170
some very bad people on the other side
also which is true but we had a great we

66
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,540
had a great conversation and he also has
legislation which I actually like very

67
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,700
much the concept of which I support to
get people going into certain areas and

68
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,350
building and constructing and putting
people to work and I told him yesterday

69
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,320
that's a concept I could support various
do you have to make any

70
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,700
we did talk about that by the way is
something I do but it's something I

71
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,070
certainly was continued to do and we did
talk about I would I would do it I told

72
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,720
them I would do and he knows we've got
the main let me tell you he knows we've

73
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,870
already done it but I told him I told
them very strongly I like that and I

74
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:53,190
also like very much legislation having
to do with jobs in certain areas mark

75
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,420
short said the other day and he worked
with the Obamacare process that you can

76
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,290
count members

77
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:12,970
I'll give you a great example so we had
a surprise from John McCain and we had

78
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,140
the vote and then John McCain Kennedy
came out of nowhere and we had a

79
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,490
surprise it was a very unpleasant
surprise and now what are we looking at

80
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,610
we have people now talking about
single-payer and that's what we get so

81
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,500
the Republicans have to stick together
better they had the votes and then John

82
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,560
McCain changed his mind pure and simple
and if the Republicans don't stick

83
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,920
together that I'm going to have to do
more and more and by the way the

84
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,820
Republican Party agrees with me the
people out there definitely agree with

85
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,960
me if they're unable to stick together
then I'm going to have to get a little

86
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,220
help from the Democrats and I've got
that I'll tell you with the tax bill I

87
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,140
would be very surprised if I don't have
at least a few Democrats I have States

88
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,630
and I won by 30 points and more where
they have people running and frankly I

89
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,070
think and I get the impression that they
very much like the ideas of this tax

90
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,620
plan we'll be submitting on the
twenty-fifth detail everything were

91
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,479
busted most people know about the plan
in terms of the details but will

92
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,669
actually be opening up the week of the
25th and I think it's going to be

93
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:38,799
something that's going to be very
successful and I do believe well this is

94
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,788
not a plan for the rich this is a plan
for the middle class and this is a plan

95
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,959
for jobs and this is a plan to bring
four trillion dollars back into the

96
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,709
United States that people have wanted to
do for years both Democrat and

97
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,880
Republican for years they've wanted to
bring that money back into the United

98
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,610
States this is a plan to bring it could
be more than portrait and frankly nobody

99
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,690
really knows what the number is they've
been saying for years at Stewart 1/2

100
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,279
trillion but that was before years I've
been hearing that so obviously as much I

101
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,690
think it's anywhere between four and
five trillion dollars 33 more than that

102
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,800
we'll be bringing that back into the
United States I will have tremendous

103
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,870
Democrat support and Republican support
to them

104
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,860
it will be revenue-neutral when you add
growth because we're going to have

105
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,110
magnificent growth if you look at GDP
for the last quarter was 3% everybody

106
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,640
was shocked to see that I think we would
have had I'm not going to use numbers

107
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,540
but I think we would have had
substantially more than that for the

108
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,940
next quarter in GDP the problem is we
just got hit with two massive hurricanes

109
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,200
the likes of which we essentially
haven't seen before so that will have a

110
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,640
little bit of an impact and maybe more
than a little bit of an effect but we

111
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:03,010
have we have GDP if you raise if you go
up one point in GDP it takes care of

112
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,470
many sins if you go up two points it
takes care of everything and I think

113
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,270
we're going to rock it in terms of GDP
and don't forget I've been saying for a

114
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,910
long time that GDP is going to be higher
than you thought when GDP it when it hit

115
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,700
3% this last quarter people including
many of the people here we're very very

116
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,800
surprised because they thought it would
be about 1.7 or 1.8 a lot of it has to

117
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,670
do with all of the regulations I've cut
when people can actually now go out and

118
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,380
build and farm and do all the things
they want to do at the same time being

119
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,920
environmentally friendly and regulation
traveling so so I just want to say

120
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,970
including growth because it's a very
fair question a good question

121
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,530
if you want to win growth because we're
going to go like a rocket ship we're

122
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,940
going to more than make up the
difference

123
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,020
we've had bigger storms in this and if
you go back into the 1930s and the 1940s

124
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,500
and you take a look we've had storms
over the years that have been bigger

125
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,360
than this if you go back into the teens
you'll see storms that were as big or

126
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,370
bigger so we did have to you know
horrific storms epic storms but if you

127
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,080
go back into the 30s and 40s and you go
back into the teens you'll see some

128
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,700
storms that were very similar and even

129
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,140
you want to keep a Sherman gentleman I
do respect your man yelling a lot I like

130
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,860
it and I respect her but we haven't made
that decision yet

131
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,850
I didn't think this the country is doing
well we got hurt by the two hurricanes

132
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,610
but the country is doing very well miss
Akbar consider new high as you see jobs

133
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,830
are at a 17-year low unemployment is
that the highest number it's ever been

134
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,780
if you look at the unemployment is low
and the employment in the country is

135
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,520
just about at the highest point that's
ever been we're doing well and very

136
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,270
importantly just to finish companies are
starting to move back into our country

137
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,590
expansion of oil firms and plants
expansion of different things even

138
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,900
Foxconn I'm looking at you your iPhone
is made by you-know-who box table and

139
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,340
box gods will be into the country for
the first time Apple is going to be

140
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,720
building massive glass there's a big
reason for that and the reason happens

141
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,260
to be Trump have a good time everyone
fighting

142
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,610
it looks like the blocks bigger
- what was a bomb that exploded

143
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,000
I've been two or three on axis big it
looks like they might be making

144
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,500
preparations front under blast then
reaching up to shake it bake where are

145
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,310
you down
we have a very good relationship with

146
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,650
China and with the president China we
are working on different things I can't

147
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,300
tell you obviously want to work it on
but believe me the people of this

148
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,570
country will be very very safe
I think that a lot of effort is going to

149
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,740
be put into this we're looking at what's
going on having as we speak we are

150
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,850
literally looking at it right now and
you will be seeing I'll probably be
