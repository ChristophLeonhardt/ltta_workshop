1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,870
It’s almost formulaic.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,930
It starts with the emotional
music:

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,690
Then the text:

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,050
The message: “I was diagnosed
with pediatric cancer

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,550
when I was 14 years old.”

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,320
“Millions of people in
the developing world

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,840
walk up to six hours
every day for water.”

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,130
Then the grand finale:
the brand.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,960
Companies continue
to use the Super Bowl platform

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,850
to promote humanitarian causes

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,080
either initiated or
supported by their brands.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,900
It’s a type of marketing that
promotes feelings over facts.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,410
The ads are light on product
details and heavy on emotion.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,630
“You helped save my child’s
life and the life

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,220
of so many children.”

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,570
“So I’d like to say thank you.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,380
Except I would like
to say it in person.”

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,880
“Can I hug you?”

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,590
And so there’s Hyundai,

20
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,390
a South Korean
car maker that has

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,460
decided to donate
a portion of sales

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,890
to childhood cancer research.

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,160
Stella Artois
donated $3.13

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,050
to water.org for every
limited edition chalice sold.

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,160
Are these companies aiming
for philanthropy or profits?

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,250
The average cost of a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,930
was more than $5
million this year.

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,510
And that doesn’t
count the expenses

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,720
tied to making and
promoting it, like the star power.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,220
Critics argue that if
companies really cared

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,790
they’d donate money
directly to the cause

32
00:01:36,790 --> 00:00:00,000
instead of a $5 million
ad promoting it.
