1
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:02,194
I WOULD ARGUE IT'S NONE OF

2
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:04,596
THEIR BUSINESS AHEAD OF TIME.

3
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:05,897
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS WITH

4
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:06,732
THE FIRST LADY.

5
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,768
LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK

6
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,436
MAINSTREAM DESTROYED TRUMP

7
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:13,772
MEDIA REFERRING TO THE NORTH

8
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,040
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG UN AS

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,874
LITTLE ROCKET MAN.

10
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:16,808
REMEMBER THIS?

11
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,243
>> President Trump: BY THE

12
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:19,411
WAY, ROCKET MAN SHOULD HAVE

13
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:28,554
BEEN HANDLED A LONG TIMING A.

14
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,089
A. -- A LONG TIME AGO.

15
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,159
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED A

16
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:36,796
LONG TIME AGO BY CLINTON.

17
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:38,764
I WON'T MENTION THE

18
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:39,365
REPUBLICANS, RIGHT?

19
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:40,699
BY OBAMA.

20
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:42,334
WHY DID THIS, YOU KNOW, THIS

21
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,737
IS A DIFFERENT, THIS IS A

22
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:46,672
DIFFERENT TIME.

23
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,940
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED

24
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,441
EIGHT YEARS AGO, FOUR YEARS

25
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,844
AGO.

26
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,079
HONESTLY, 15 YEARS AGO.

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,281
AND 20 YEARS AGO.

28
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:57,082
AND 25 YEARS AGO.

29
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,651
THIS SHOULDN'T BE HANDLED NOW.

30
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,519
BUT I'M GOING TO HANDLE IT

31
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,856
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HANDLE IT.

32
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:04,590
>> Sean: REMEMBER AT THE

33
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,658
TIME PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA

34
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:06,792
CRITICIZEDDED THE PRESIDENT'S

35
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:07,993
TOUGH RHETORIC BUT IT HAS

36
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,395
CLEARLY WORKED NOW THE SUMMIT

37
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,396
IS SET FOR NEXT MONTH.

38
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:12,097
IN AN INTERVIEW ON "FACE THE

39
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:14,066
NATION" THE NEW SECRETARY OF

40
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,334

DESCRIBE WHAT TRUCK HIM ABOUT

42
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:18,704
THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR --

43
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,872
STRUCK HIM ABOUT THE NORTH

44
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,240
KOREAN DICTATOR.

45
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,141
>> HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN

46
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,809
THE SENSE HE KNOWS THE FILES.

47
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,578
HE IS VERY CAPABLE OF ENGAGING

48
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:27,546
IN COMPLEX SET OF DISCUSSIONS.

49
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,981
WHEN I ASK HIM A QUESTION

50
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,915
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS A

51
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,151
LITTLE OFF, HE ANSWERS IT.

52
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,652
THERE ARE NO CARDS.

53
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:35,654
IT'S CHAIRMAN KIM IN THIS CASE

54
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:38,257
INTERACTING WITH ME DIRECTLY.

55
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:39,024
HAVING A ROBUST DISCUSSION

56
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:40,960
ABOUT WHAT THE OUTLINES OF A

57
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,795
SUCCESS NEGOTIATION BETWEEN

58
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:44,163
OUR TWO COUNTRIES MIGHT

59
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:46,065
ULTIMATELY BE.

60
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,700
>> Sean: WITH THE REACTION,

61
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,870
FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY

62
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,837
STRATEGIST SEBASTIAN GORKA AND

63
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:54,406
AUTHOR OF THE BEST SELLER.

64
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,141
A FRIEND, WE DON'T ALWAYS

65
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:56,675
AGREE.

66
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,911
BUT HE IS MY BROTHER.

67
00:01:58,911 --> 00:01:59,845
GERALDO RIVERA.

68
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:01,046
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

69
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,848
BOTH OF YOU.

70
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,751
LET ME START WITH YOU,

71
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,085
GERALDO.

72
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,953
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN.

73
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:08,954
POMPEO IS A GENIUS.

74
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,723
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF HIS FOR A

75
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:12,591
LONG TIME AND I'M GLAD HE IS

76
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,192
OUR SECRETARY OF STATE.

77
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:15,227
WHAT HE SAYS TO ME IS

78
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:15,628
IMPRESSIVE.

79
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:16,562
THINK ABOUT THIS.

80
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,831
TRUMP CALLS HIM "LITTLE ROCKET

81
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:20,199
MAN" AND HE SHOWS MILITARY

82
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,800
FORCE AND PUTS SANCTIONS IN

83
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,167
PLACE.

84
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,336
THE ROCKETS STOP BEING FIRED.

85
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:25,471
WORLD IS SAFER.

86
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,540
THREE HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED.

87
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,575
HE CROSSES THE D.M.Z. AND WE

88
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:31,644
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

89
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:32,912
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

90
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:33,279
PENINSULA.

91
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,582
YOUR KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT?

92
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:37,416
GOOD STORY.

93
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,017
>> I'LL SAY.

94
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,752
IF YOU CONSIDER HOW MUCH WE

95
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:40,519
TRAVELED SINCE THE OLYMPICS.

96
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,387
JUST SINCE THE OLYMPICS.

97
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:45,858
IF I WAS A DIPLOMAT I'D SAY I

98
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:48,227
WAS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

99
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:50,162
I'M NOT A DIPLOMAT.

100
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:52,965
AND I'M NOT DIPLOMATIC.

101
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,766
>> Sean: NO KIDDING.

102
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:54,366
WE KNOW YOU.

103
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,435
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

104
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:59,271
I FEEL WE HAVE MOVED SO FAR.

105
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:01,073
AND POMPEO IS A NUTS AND BOLTS

106
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:01,740
KIND OF GUY.

107
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,142
IT'S NOT PIE IN THE SKY.

108
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,077
IT'S NOT WISHFUL THINKING ON

109
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,378
THE PART OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

110
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,447
THESE ARE MEANINGFUL STEPS.

111
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,249
RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.

112
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:11,483
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IN TWO WEEKS

113
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,652
HE WILL BE BLOWING UP THE

114
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,220
TUNNELS TO HIS TESTING

115
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,621
FACILITIES.

116
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,222
THE FACT THAT HE IS AGREEING

117
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:21,026
TO DISMANTLE.

118
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,761
SHIP COMPONENT PARTS TO OAK

119
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,129
RIDGE, TENNESSEE.

120
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,664
IT IS SPECTACULAR, SEAN.

121
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,333
IF THIS INDEED WHAT IS GOING

122
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,234
TO HAPPEN, THIS IS THE BIGGEST

123
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:32,571
MOVE TOWARD PEACE SINCE THE

124
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:33,539
FOUNDING OF THE UNITED

125
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:33,973
NATIONS.

126
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:34,673
>> Sean: AND THAT LITERALLY

127
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,375
THE ALLIANCE CREATED BY THE

128
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,843
PRESIDENT, ISRAEL, THE

129
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,145
JORDANIANS, THE EGYPTIANS,

130
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,282
SAUDIS, EMIRATES.

131
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:47,820
NO CARGO PLANES OF CACHE.

132
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,821
HUGE DIFFERENCE.

133
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,989
>> IT'S AMAZING WHAT

134
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,323
DIFFERENCE ONE ELECTION CAN

135
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:51,657
MAKE.

136
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:52,691
IT TRULY IS.

137
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,193
THESE ARE THE KIND OF RESULTS

138
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,894
YOU WOULD BE PROUD OF AT THE

139
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,330
ENT OF A TWO-TERM PRESIDENCY.

140
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,132
I WAS IN TOUCH WITH MIKE

141
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:00,799
POMPEO TODAY.

142
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,135
THE SPIRITS ARE VERY HIGH.

143
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:04,837
WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS.

144
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,538
REMEMBER, THIS IS A

145
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:06,972
DICTATORSHIP.

146
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,941
THIS IS A REGIME THAT KEPT ITS

147
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:09,641
PEOPLE PRISONER.

148
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:12,077
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU PUT

149
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:14,046
THESE THINGS ON A WHITE BOARD

150
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,180
IN JUST 15 MONTHS.

151
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,714
ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN

152
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,082
ACHIEVED.

153
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,916
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE

154
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,387
TO HAVE A SUMMIT ON KOREAN

155
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,722
PEACE IN EIGHT YEARS' TIME.

156
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,724
NOT NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK

157
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,058
AFTER.

158
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,893
SO STUNNING.

159
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,995
FROM THE 70th BIRTHDAY OF

160
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,296
THE MODERN ISRAELI STATE TO

161
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,998
THE OPENING OF THE EMBASSY,

162
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:35,934
THE HIT JUST KEEP COMING.

163
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,536
>> Sean: GERALDO, I WILL SAY

164
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:37,870
THIS.

165
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,339
THAT AND PULLING OUT OF THE

166
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,540
IRANIAN DEAL AND THE GREAT

167
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,574
NEWS ON THE ECONOMY, AND

168
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,342
EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.

169
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,743
ALL THE NOISE I ARGUE IS NOT

170
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,279
GOING TO MEAN A THING WHEN IT

171
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,580
COMES TO 2018 ELECTION.

172
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,748
I BELIEVE THIS ELECTION WILL

173
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,583
BE ABOUT THE ECONOMY DOING SO

174
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,551
MUCH BETTER.

175
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,887
A WORLD BEING A SAFER PLACE.

176
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:55,954
A PRESIDENT KEEPING HIS

177
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:58,090
PROMISES AND A DESIRE TO ROLL

178
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,958
BACK TAX CUTS AND IMPEACH THIS

179
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,160
PRESIDENT WILL BE ON THE

180
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,329
BALLOT IN EVERY CONGRESSIONAL

181
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:04,763
DISTRICT.

182
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,898
>> YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING

183
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:06,899
THAT YOU SAY THAT.

184
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,733
I AGREE.

185
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,335
AND DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE

186
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:10,669
AGREES?

187
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,671
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" WEEK IN

188
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:13,872
REVIEW HAD AN ARTICLE I

189
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:16,241
THOUGHT WAS VERY, VERY

190
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:16,608
TELLING.

191
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,377
IT SAID LIBERALS ARE SO SMUG,

192
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:19,311
THEY KNOW IT ALL.

193
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,546
THEY ARE SO SURE THAT THEY

194
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,780
HAVE GOD ON THEIR SIDE AND

195
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,551
THAT TRUMP IS THE DEVIL

196
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:26,452
INCARNATE THAT THEIR ATTITUDE

197
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,620
IS GOING TO LEAD THEM DOWN THE

198
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,489
PRIM ROSE PATH.

199
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:32,758
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING A

200
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:33,892
SPECTACULAR JOB WITH THE

201
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:39,364
ECONOMY AS YOU MENTIONED.

202
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:41,467
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT,

203
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,135
HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT AND

204
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,369
FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT,

205
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:45,704
INDICATORS OF OPTIMISM AND

206
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:47,539
EVERYTHING POINTED UP.

207
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,643
IF HE CAN DELIVER TRUE

208
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,478
DENUCLEARIZED KOREAN

209
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,712
PENINSULA, THE ATOMIC CLOCK

210
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,280
THAT TICKS TOWARD MIDNIGHT

211
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,882
WOULD L HAVE TO BE SET BACK

212
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:57,683
FIVE OR TEN MINUTES.

213
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:00,752
THIS IS A PROFOUND STEP IN THE

214
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:01,820
RIGHT DIRECTION.

215
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,288
>> Sean: GIVE DR. GORKA THE

216
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:04,923
LAST WORD.

217
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:05,958
>> SEAN, GERALDO, THE

218
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,659
PRESIDENT MAKES PROMISES.

219
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,261
HE KEEPS PROMISES.

220
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,497
THIS IS WHAT MAKING AMERICA

221
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,065
GREAT AGAIN LOOKS LIKE.

222
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:14,533
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SEVEN

223
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,401
MORE YEARS OF IT AND THEN

224
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,904
EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT

225
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:19,404
PENCE.

226
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:20,205
>> Sean: WHAT ABOUT

227
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:20,772
PRESIDENT GERALDO?

228
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:22,641
I THOUGHT HE WAS RUNNING.

229
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,209
>> PRESIDENT HANNITY, I HEAR

230
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,044
HE IS NEXT IN LINE.

231
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:26,812
>> Sean: EVERYONE WRITES

232
00:06:26,812 --> 00:00:00,000
