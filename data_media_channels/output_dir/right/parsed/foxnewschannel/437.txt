>> WHEN TUCKER STARTED THIS SHOW
THERE WAS THE THING YOU SAID, HE
SAID, I NEVER EAT ON TV.
THEN HE JOINED "FOX & FRIENDS."
>> TUCKER CARLSON MADE HIS NAME,
MADE YOU FAMOUS.
>> NOW IT IS CLIP-ON.
>> TUCKER, I THINK YOU'RE HIGHLY
SKILLED WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO.
>> EXACTLY.
WHATEVER IT IS I DO.
>> TUCKER CARLSON IN FULL SUIT
IN THE DUNK TANK.
BRIAN: SEE HIM AT NIGHT,
8:00 EASTERN TIME, HE CAME FROM
THIS SHOW.
AINSLEY: TUCKER STARTED HERE.
BRIAN: VERY EXCITED FOR YOUR
BOOK OUT, CALLED, "SHIP OF
FOOLS."
FIRST THINGS FIRST.
I'VE BEEN DYING TO ASK YOU.
I WATCHED YOU ON CNN ON
CROSSFIRE, VERY SERIOUS
SITUATIONS.
YOU KNOW IN FOUR HOURS ON
"FOX & FRIENDS," YOU'RE SERIOUS,
YOU'RE FUN, CONVERSATIONAL, WHAT
DID THAT DO FOR YOU BEING IN
THAT FORMAT?
HOW DIFFERENT WAS IT?
>> IT WAS LIKE BOOT CAMP.
IT BROKE DOWN MY DIGNITY AND
REBUILT IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
BECAME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PERSON.
I NEVER DID A DUNK TANK ON
"CROSSFIRE."
BRIAN: TOTAL SHAME.
>> TOTAL SHAME.
TOTAL SINCERITY THE HARD ETF
SHOW TO HOST EVER BEEN,
"FOX & FRIENDS."
STEVE: WHY?
>> DURATION, TIME, RANGE OF
STUFF.
YOU GO FROM TALKING ABOUT THE
THINGS AT THE VERY CENTER OF THE
NATIONAL CONVERSATION TO
COOKING.
BRIAN: COOKING.
>> IT IS, THE WHOLE RANGE.
REALLY TAKES EVERYTHING YOU
HAVE.
AINSLEY: WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO
GET RID OF THE BOW TIES BECAUSE
THAT IS YOUR SIGNATURE?
>> WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH PENN
STATION WITH A BOW TIE, IT IS
PROVOCATIVE ACT.
PEOPLE RESPOND IN HOSTILE WAY.
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A
FISTFIGHT GOING TO THE TRAIN.
I GAVE UP.
STEVE: WHO ARE THE SHIP OF
FOOLS.
YOU TALK ABOUT ELITES AND THERE
IS A NEW CATEGORY OF ELITES?
>> I WAS OBSESSED WITH THE
QUESTION WHY DID THE PRESIDENT
GET ELECTED?
WHY DID THE COUNTRY ELECT
DONALD TRUMP.
WE COVERED THE CAMPAIGN.
THE EXPLANATIONS WERE
RIDICULOUS.
PUTIN DID IT.
IT IS SO DUMB.
PEOPLE IN BOTH PARTIES MADE
SERIES OF BAD DECISIONS NEVER
ADMITTED IT, NEVER LEARNED A
SINGLE THING FROM IT, BLAMED
VOTERS FOR PROBLEMS.
VOTERS SAID WE'LL PUNISH YOU.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO US.
WE'LL DO SOMETHING SO RADICAL
WE'LL HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION.
WE'LL ELECT SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T
EXPECT, DONALD TRUMP.
BY THE WAY, WHAT HAPPENED?
PEOPLE IN CHARGE COMPLETELY
IGNORED THE LESSON.
REFUSED TO LEARN ANYTHING.
CONTINUED TO ATTACK VOTERS EVEN
MORE.
AINSLEY: WHO IN PARTICULAR IS IN
THE SHIP?
>> LOOK, WOULD SAY THE PEOPLE
WHO MADE CRITICAL DECISIONS ON
FOREIGN POLICY AND OUR ECONOMIC
POLICY AND BY THE WAY OUR SOCIAL
POLICY OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS.
YOU KNOW WHO EXACTLY THEY ARE.
INCLUDE MANY LEADERS OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
ALMOST THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
BY THE WAY A LOT OF OUR BUSINESS
LEADERS WHO, PROFITED, LOOK, THE
PROBLEM IS, THE MIDDLE CLASS AND
THE COUNTRY BECAME A MINORITY IN
2015.
NOBODY EVEN NOTICED.
IT WASN'T A NEWS STORY.
YET IT WAS THE CRITICAL SHIFT OF
MY LIFETIME.
YOU CAN'T HAVE A DEMOCRACY IN A
COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A
MIDDLE CLASS MAJORITY AND NOBODY
CARED!
BRIAN: HE IS REDOING TRADE
AGREEMENTS.
HE IS DECIDING NOT TO GET
INVOLVED IN CONFLICTS IT IS
BEGINNING TO BUILD UP THE MIDDLE
CLASS.
WHAT YOU SAW YESTERDAY IN THE
MORNING, ROCKETED UP EVERYONE'S
401(k)S REDOING NAFTA,
MANUFACTURING LEFT, WORKERS NO
LONGER HAD A PLACE TO GO.
WE MIGHT PAY A LITTLE MORE FOR
AUTOMOBILES BUT HAVE A REASON TO
BUILD THINGS AGAIN.
>> ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE
AVERAGE PERSON IN THE COUNTRY
FEELS LIKE HE IS VESTED IN THE
SYSTEM.
BRIAN: OR SHE.
>> USING GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT
PRONUNCIATION, OF COURSE.
THE POINT HE OR SHE COULD, FEEL
LIKE MY LIFE IS GETTING BETTER,
MY EFFORT IS PAYING OFF.
MY KIDS HAVE A SHOT AT A BETTER
LIFE THAN I DO.
THE AVERAGE 22-YEAR-OLD KNOWS HE
OR SHE WILL NOT MAKE WHAT HIS OR
HER PARENTS MADE.
THAT IS A DISASTER.
YOU HAVE TO FIX THAT.
BRIAN: LIBERAL PARTY, THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS CHANGED.
YOU'RE NOT CRITICIZING
DEMOCRATS.
WHAT YOU SEE NOW ON THE LEFT
REALLY CONCERNS YOU, BECAUSE
DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING YOU SEE.
>> IT IS TERRIFYING.
I GREW UP AROUND LIBERALS AND
CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON, D.C.,
BELIEVED IN FREE SPEECH, DUE
PROCESS AND COLORBLINDNESS.
EXACT SAME PEOPLE CRUSH SPEECH,
DENY DUE PROCESS, TELL US THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT
PEOPLE IS THEIR DNA AND SKIN
COLOR.
MIRROR IMAGE THE WAY THEY WERE.
IT IS TERRIFYING AND ORWELLIAN,
THREAT TO ALL OF US, LIBERAL AND
CONSERVATIVE.
WE SHOULD HONESTLY SPEAK UP
EVERY TIME THEY CHALLENGE THE
BASIC AMERICAN VALUES.
AINSLEY: YOU GREW UP IN THE D.C.
AREA.
RAIDSRAISED YOUR KIDS IN THE
AREA.
BRETT KAVANAUGH, TALK ABOUT HIM,
WE'VE GONE FROM WOMEN ACCUSING
HIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT NOT HAVING
ANY EVIDENCE, NOW QUESTIONING
HIS FRIENDS AT PARTIES AT BARS.
ONE GUY SAYS HE HAD ICE THROWN
ON HIM WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH.
THIS IS THE HEADLINE IN
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" THIS
MORNING.
KAVANAUGH WAS QUESTIONED BY
POLICE AFTER BAR FIGHT IN 1985.
THEY'RE GOING BACK TO THE
'80s?
>> I WISH THEY TOLD ME THAT.
I WOULD HAVE NEVER SUPPORTED
HIM.
QUESTIONED BY POLICE IN 1985
THROWING ICE ON SOMEBODY?
IT IS OVER, MAN.
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH SO MUCH
OF COVERAGE, NO SELF AWARENESS
AT ALL.
GUY WRITING HEADLINE, KAVANAUGH
QUESTIONED BY POLICE IN 1985
OVER PAR FIGHT.
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?
I WROTE A HEADLINE THAT STUPID
AND IRRELEVANT?
I WILL SET INSURANCE THIS IS
DUMB.
STEVE: HE WAS QUESTIONED OVER A
BAR FIGHT IN 1985.
>> SO WAS I.
WHAT IS THIS?
STEVE: HEADLINE IT WAS ICE HE
THREW.
>> ICE HE THREW.
AGAIN IF YOU'RE WRITING THAT
STORY, IS THIS WHY I GOT INTO
JOURNALISM, CARRY WATER FOR A
POLITICAL PARTY?
TO BE A PROPOGANDIST, TO IT
WRITE SOMETHING SO STUPID I
CAN'T LOOK IN THE MIRROR WITHOUT
SELF-LOATHING?
STEVE: DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO
THAT QUESTION.
>> PEOPLE NEVER PAUSE TO ASK
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?
BRIAN: THIS STORY MORE THAN ANY
OTHER, THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING
ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS 50, TALKING
ABOUT 10th GRADE, A MAN WHO
IS 12th GRADE AND BOTH CAN'T
REINSTRUCT THE SCENES.
THEY FRESHMAN YEAR IN YALE, MAIN
ACCUSER SAYS I DRANK SO MUCH I
DIDN'T REMEMBER.
I NEED ADWEEK TO REMEMBER
WHETHER IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH
OR NOT.
STEVE: ASKING PEOPLE.
BRIAN: "NEW YORK TIMES" WALKED
AWAY FROM THAT STORY BUT THAT
COULD SINK A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
>> DEMOCRATS DON'T CONTROL THE
SENATE ACTUALLY LAST I CHECKED.
REPUBLICANS, IF I LEVY ONE
CRITICISM OF THEM, THEY'RE TOO
LITERAL.
THEY PLAY ALONG.
IT IS LUCY AND THE FOOTBALL.
DEMOCRATS ACTING IN UTTERLY BAD
FAITH.
EVERY PERSON WATCHING CAREFULLY
KNOW THAT.
REPUBLICANS RESPONDING THIS IS
NOT SERIOUS.
HE IS A SITTING FEDERAL JUDGE.
ISSUED SCORES OF OPINIONS.
BRIAN: 309.
>> THANK YOU.
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH REASONING
OR CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS TELL
ME.
DON'T TELL ME ABOUT A SINGLE
WORD ABOUT HIS COLLEGE DRINKING.
IT IS STUPID, IRRELEVANT, I'M
NOT PLAYING ALONG.
THAT IS WHAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS
OUGHT TO BE SAYING.
STEVE: REPUBLICAN SENATORS DO
NOT DO WHICH IS THE DEMOCRAT
SENATORS DO, STICK TOGETHER.
>> EXACTLILY.
STEVE: REPUBLICANS YOU HAVE
THREE OR FOUR --
>> THEY'RE NOT DOING, THIS IS
WHAT MY BOOK IS ABOUT, THEY'RE
NOT PROTECTING THEIR OWN VOTERS.
DEMOCRATS WAKE UP WE'RE
REPRESENTING PEOPLE VOTED FOR US
BECAUSE THEY WANT SOMETHING
SPECIFIC, IN THEIR CASE POWER.
REPUBLICANS ARE REPRESENTING
PEOPLE WHO ARE REVILED BY ALMOST
EVERYONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS POWER.
MIDDLE CLASS IS HATED.
THEY'RE NOT STANDINGS UP FOR AND
DEFENDING THEIR PEOPLE.
WHAT IS THAT?
BY PEOPLE, BY THE WAY I'M
TALKING ABOUT SOCIOECONOMIC
CLASS NOT TALKING ABOUT ETHNIC
GROUP OR IDENTITY POLITICS
GARBAGE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE
CENTER OF OUR ECONOMY.
THOSE PEOPLE ARE HATED BY
EVERYONE IN HOLLYWOOD AND
FINANCE.
THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE THEIR
PROTECTORS AND THEY'RE NOT.
STEVE: THE BRAND NEW BOOK COMES
OUT TODAY, "SHIP OF FOOLS."
BACK ON THE COUCH.
>> I'M GOING.
BRIAN: SEE YOU ON RADIO, BUT
WILL YOU DO THE SHOW FROM
NEW YORK?
>> ALL WEEK.
I LOVE IT.
IT IS THE BIG APPLE, MAN.
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE.
EIGHT MILLION STORIES LOVE IT.
YOU PARTICULARLY ALSO YOUR
FRIENDS.
AINSLEY: YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR.
BRIAN: SHE IS DEFINITELY THE
