00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,680
COMPTON RAPPER KENDRICK LAMAR
HAS WON A PULITZER PRIZE FOR HIS

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,070
ALBUM DAMN!

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,320
IT IS VERY GOOD.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,089
I WAS A PHENOMENAL ALBUM.

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,160
HE HAS MADE HISTORY BY
WINNING THIS PULITZER.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:34,520
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:44,120
>> I'M GOING TO JUMP IN HERE.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,300
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT KENDRICK
LAMAR BECAUSE I STOP LISTENING

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,300
TO THE RADIO ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,732
BUT YOU GUYS ALL LOVE HIM AND
I'M SURE HE'S FANTASTIC.

11
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:57,750
THE IDEAS HE TALKS ABOUT IS MORE
IMPORTANT AND IS REALLY

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,230
INTERESTING.

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,190
I LOVE HOW THEY ARE LIKE WE'RE
GOING TO GET CRAZY HERE AND

14
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:17,300
OPEN UP TO JAZZ.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,700
AND PULITZER
FOLKS ARE GREAT PEOPLE BUT THE

16
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,740
IDEA THAT THE ONLY GOOD ART IS
DEAD ART, BUT THEY CALL IT

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,570
CULTURE, OPERA, BALLET
WHATEVER.

18
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,660
I CAN'T STAND THAT.

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,770
THOSE ARE ANCIENT FORMS OF ART.

20
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,229
>>
I LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC AS WELL.

21
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,159
>> THAT IS FINE BUT IT IS DEAD.

22
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,110
>>YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE
CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

23
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,950
YOU ONLY SEE THROUGH
YOUR NARROW LENS.

24
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,960
>> IT IS NOT NARROW.

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,070
EVERYBODY ELSE'S NARROW.

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,830
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS FUNNY.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:06,360
SHAKESPEARE AND OPERA BACK IN
THE DAY WERE POP-CULTURE.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,350
IT WAS LIKE A MOVIE AND HE WAS
REALLY GOOD AT IT.

29
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:21,810
I KNOW I AM A BAD GUY.

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,840
BOTTOM LINE, THANK YOU PULITZER
FOR OPENING YOUR VISION A LITTLE

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,349
FURTHER AND SEEING THAT
POP-CULTURE DOES IT MATTER.

32
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,090
MATTERS TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
THAT LISTEN TO KENDRICK LAMAR

33
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,920
AND ARE INFLUENCED BY HIM.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,760
>> THE REASON WHY I AM VERY
HAPPY ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE A

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,950
LOT OF TIMES RAPPERS GET

36
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,030
PORTRAYED IN ONE STEREOTYPICAL
WAY.

37
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,500
THEY ARE WRAPPING ABOUT THEIR
MONEY, WOMEN IN A DISRESPECTFUL

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,489
WAY, AND THAT IS IT.

39
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,460
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY RAPPERS
OUT THERE WHO ACTUALLY GIVE

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,489
YOU AN EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT
THEIR COMMUNITIES GO THROUGH.

41
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,569
I THINK KENDRICK DOES A REALLY
GREAT JOB OF THAT.

42
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,690
J COLE DOES A GREAT JOB OF THAT.

43
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,900
THERE'S THIS ONE SONG CALLED
NEIGHBORS BY J COLE, THE LYRICS

44
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,620
OF THAT SONG REALLY GET TO THE
HEART OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT

45
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,390
HAS DONE CERTAIN PEOPLE WRONG.

46
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,379
HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW HIS
NEIGHBORS THINK HE IS SELLING

47
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,310
DOPE, AND I JUST LOVE THAT

48
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,250
BECAUSE HE IS A RICH BLACK GUY,
HE BUYS THIS BEAUTIFUL BIG HOME

49
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,989
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE

50
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,870
NEIGHBORS PROBABLY THINK HE
IS SELLING DOPE.

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,459
IT JUST TOUCHES ON SOMETHING
THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

52
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,720
GO THROUGH.

53
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:56,150
>> I GREW UP LISTENING TO
PUBLIC ENEMY.

54
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:05,860
IT IS POP-CULTURE.

55
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,770
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU HAVE
NEVER LIVED THAT LIFE, HE GIVES

56
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,870
YOU A WINDOW INTO THAT LIFE AND
THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING.

57
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,149
YOU MIGHT LEARN A THING OR TWO.

58
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:29,279
INSTEAD I WILL GIVE YOU A
PULITZER COMMITTEE QUOTE.

59
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:36,490
THIS IS ABOUT KENDRICK LAMAR.

60
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,400
WELL INDEED IT DOES.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,440
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD PHRASE IT
THAT WAY BUT I ENJOYED THE

62
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:52,349
PULITZER PRIZE FREEZING
IT 

63
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:53,349
THAT WAY.

64
00:04:53,349 --> 00:05:09,270
>> THAT 

65
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,400
IS THE REASON WHY IT
MAKES YOU THINK OF CLASSICAL

66
00:05:14,400 --> 00:00:00,000
MUSIC AND BALLET.
