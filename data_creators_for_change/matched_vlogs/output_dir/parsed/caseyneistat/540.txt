that now this is just a domestic flight
to Miami so they're using the entire
business class cabin which is where I'm
sitting right now in these lay flat
seats as economy class so all the people
who were lucky enough to get seated up
here get a lay flat business class seat
and they only paid for an economy ticket
so everyone around me is freaking out
American Airlines they are so excited
she looks angry okay bye kiddos
and II shortly I didn't get as much work
done as I'd like to I started watching
thoracic and that's such an awesome
movie especially when the t-rex might
see indominus rex and totally distract
it landon like 15 minutes

I am here in Fort Lauderdale because I
don't like a year ago this company
called my rule they asked if I would
judge a competition around like best
viral video whatever like whoever won
that competition got to come to Florida
and do all this fun stuff but because
I'm a judge I also got to come to
Florida and do all this fun stuff so
basically I'm down here with this
company and a bunch of winners and then
I'm just the freeloader which is awesome
getting after it with a real quick run
all right that was a scant four and a
half miles I only had like 28 minutes to
run so I'm okay with that
all right back to the hotel solid run
