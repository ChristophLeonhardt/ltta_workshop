1
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,266
>> DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY

2
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,167
CREDENCE TO THE PRESIDENT'S

3
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:31,704
CLAIM THAT YOU BROKE THE LAWS

4
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,072
RELEASING THE MEMOS?

5
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:34,741
>> NO.

6
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,744
I THINK HE'S MAKING STUFF UP.

7
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:39,579
>> Laura: THE UP RETURNED FIRE

8
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,947
ON "FOX AND FRIENDS."

9
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:44,050
>> COMEY IS A LEAKER AND A LIAR.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,019
HE LEAKED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

11
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:48,421
TO GET A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

12
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,623
HE'S GUILTY OF CRIMES.

13
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:53,026
IF WE HAD A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

14
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,228
DOING THEIR JOB --

15
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:56,729
>> Laura: AND IN HIS FOX NEWS

16
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,364
INTERVIEW WITH BRET BAIER, COMEY

17
00:00:58,364 --> 00:01:00,500
RESPONDED TO TRUMP'S

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,900
ACCUSATIONS.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,769
>> HE'S JUST WRONG.

20
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,004
FACTS REALLY DO MATTER.

21
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:06,406
THAT'S WHY I'M ON THE SHOW.

22
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,207
THE MEMO IS UNCLASSIFIED.

23
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,509
IT'S IN MY BACK.

24
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:10,977
THE FBI CLEARED THAT BOOK BEFORE

25
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:12,779
IT COULD BE PUBLISHED.

26
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,281
IT'S A FALSE STATEMENT.

27
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,849
>> Laura: LET'S SEPARATE FACT

28
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:20,887
FROM FICTION WITH OUR PANEL.

29
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:25,692
JIM JORDAN AND BYRON YORK,

30
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,628
RICHARD GOODSTEIN, A FORMER

31
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:29,662
ADVISER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON.

32
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:33,066
I WANT TO PLAY PART OF THIS

33
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:33,866
INTERVIEW TONIGHT WHERE BRETT

34
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:35,668
ASKED ABOUT THE CLINTON

35
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,136
INVESTIGATION AND THE

36
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:37,537
COMPARISON.

37
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:38,171
LET'S WATCH.

38
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,406
>> YOU CAN SEE THE DISPARITY

39
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,008
WHERE PEOPLE LOOK AT THE CLINTON

40
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,944
CASE AND HOW THE TRUMP CASE IS

41
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:45,278
HANDLED.

42
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:47,780
>> I DON'T SEE DISPARITY THOUGH.

43
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,649
>> THERE IS A DISPARITY.

44
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:50,950
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE IT.

45
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,018
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT WRONG.

46
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:53,953
HE'S NOT MAKING THINGS UP.

47
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:58,825
HE'S NOT MAKING UP THE FACT THAT

48
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:01,127
THEY CALLED SHERYL MILLS --

49
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,428
>> Laura: SHERYL MILLS WAS --

50
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:03,730
>> CLINTON'S LAWYER AND HER

51
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,831
CHIEF OF STAFF AND THE SUBJECT

52
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,733
OF THE INVESTIGATION WHEN THE

53
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,967
CLINTON INVESTIGATION STARTED.

54
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:11,571
COMPARE THAT TO THE IDEA THAT

55
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,372
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER

56
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:14,007
GETS HIS DOOR KICKED IN AND THE

57
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,274
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED

58
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:16,776
STATES I DON'T EVEN THINK WAS

59
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:17,143
CONSULTED.

60
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:18,611
IT WAS RUN OUTSIDE OF THE

61
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:20,013
UMBRELLA OF THE RUSSIAN

62
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:20,747
INVESTIGATION, THE MUELLER

63
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:22,181
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.

64
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,350
YOU DON'T TAKE TO THE HIGHEST

65
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,985
OFFICERS IN THE LAND WHEN YOU

66
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:28,121
KICK IN THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER'S

67
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:28,521
DOOR?

68
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:29,389
OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

69
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,957
BE UNSET AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

70
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:32,125
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE UPSET.

71
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,327
>> BYRON, THERE WAS A MOMENT

72
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:36,229
THAT THEY DISCUSSED WHO FUNDED

73
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,929
THE DOSSIER.

74
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:39,932
YOU'VE BEEN WRITING ABOUT THIS.

75
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:40,633
LET'S WATCH.

76
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:43,302
>> WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT THE

77
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:45,905
DNC AND HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN

78
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,173
FUNDED CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S

79
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:47,473
WORK?

80
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:49,509
>> I STILL DON'T KNOW THAT FOR A

81
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,809
FACT.

82
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:50,476
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

83
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,879
>> I ONLY SAW IT IN THE MEDIA.

84
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,547
I KNEW IT WAS FUNDED FIRST BY

85
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:55,448
REPUBLICANS --

86
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:56,149
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

87
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:56,949
>> I'M SORRY?

88
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:59,085
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

89
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:08,027
THE DOSSIER WAS FOUNDED BY THE

90
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:08,428
REPUBLICANS?

91
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:09,729
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO IT WAS

92
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,163
FUNDED BY?

93
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,999
>> I WANTED TO KNOW WHO I KNEW.

94
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,367
IT WAS FUNDED BY PEOPLE

95
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,968
POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO DONALD

96
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:16,269
TRUMP.

97
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,037
WHICH PARTICULAR OPPONENTS

98
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:18,738
WASN'T IMPORTANT TO ME.

99
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:22,475
>> THIS WAS A STUNNING MOMENT.

100
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,011
HE SHOWED APPARENT IGNORANCE OF

101
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,447
THE BASIC FACTS OF THE DOSSIER,

102
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:28,748
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST

103
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:30,149
IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THE WHOLE

104
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:31,551
TRUMP --

105
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:32,018
>> Laura: WHY?

106
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:33,786
IT WAS THE MAIN BASIS FOR THE

107
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,321
APPLICATION TO SPY ON CARTER

108
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:35,621
PAGE.

109
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,823
>> AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT COMEY

110
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:40,393
AND THE OTHER INTEL CHIEFS

111
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:41,394
BRIEFED PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP ON

112
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:45,298
ON JANUARY 26, 2017 STARTING THE

113
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,133
WHOLE FIGHT BETWEEN TRUMP AND

114
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:47,433
COMEY.

115
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:48,634
IT'S A HUGELY IMPORTANT

116
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:51,304
DOCUMENT.

117
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:54,474
TALKING POINT THAT IT BEGAN WITH

118
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:54,874
REPUBLICANS.

119
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:58,311
WE KNOW -- ANYBODY HAS FOLLOWED

120
00:03:58,311 --> 00:03:59,746
KNOWS THAT THE FUSION GPS

121
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,347
RESEARCH INTO TRUMP'S BUSINESS

122
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:03,950
LIFE BEGAN WITH REPUBLICANS.

123
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,685
THEY QUIT THAT.

124
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:08,187
THEN THE STEELE DOSSIER WAS

125
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,489
FUNDED BY DEMOCRATS.

126
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,159
>> Laura: ISN'T THAT SHOCKING?

127
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,794
YOU'VE SOLD 600,000 BOOKS, WHICH

128
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:16,995
IS AMAZING.

129
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,199
YOU WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THIS.

130
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,837
YOU'RE ON BRET BAIER'S SHOW.

131
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:27,440
OH, IT'S WHAT I READ IN THE

132
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,740
MEDIA.

133
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,674
YOU WERE FBI DIRECTOR.

134
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,443
YOU USED THIS DOCUMENT.

135
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:32,912
RICHARD, I'M SORRY, BUT THAT DID

136
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:38,117
STRIKE ME AS QUITE A STUNNER.

137
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:41,053
>> IF I CAN, CONGRESS MADE

138
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,889
REFERENCE TO SHERYL MILLS,

139
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:43,923
HILLARY CLINTON'S LAWYER.

140
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,091
DONALD TRUMP WHO SAID ON AIR

141
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:46,993
FORCE ONE, CALL MY LAWYER,

142
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:48,094
MICHAEL COHEN.

143
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,262
FAMOUSLY SAID DURING THE

144
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:50,596
CAMPAIGN, IF YOU TAKE THE FIFTH,

145
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:53,232
IT'S BECAUSE YOUR GUILTY.

146
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,935
THAT'S WHAT MOB PEOPLE DO.

147
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,270
MILLS NEVER TOOK THE FIFTH

148
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,272
NOBODY IN THE CLINTONS TOOK THE

149
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:02,074
FIFTH OTHER THAN THE ONE GUY --

150
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,342
>> Laura: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

151
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,410
TAKE THE FIFTH.

152
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,012
THEY GAVE HER IMMUNITY.

153
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:07,180
>> THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN ANYBODY

154
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,314
THEY WANTED --

155
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:09,849
>> Laura: WHY DID THEY GIVE HER

156
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:10,216
IMMUNITY?

157
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:12,151
>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

158
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:14,187
THE SUGGESTION THERE'S A

159
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,421
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO.

160
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:16,789
CARTER PAGE IS ONE OF FIVE

161
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,391
FOREIGN POLICY ADVISERS THAT

162
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,192
DONALD TRUMP NAMED AND THE

163
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,627
FBI -- HE WAS A FOREIGN AGENT.

164
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:22,161
EXCUSE ME.

165
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,729
THAT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE'RE

166
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:24,463
TALKING ABOUT.

167
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:26,032
DONALD TRUMP WENT INTO THE OVAL

168
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:27,266
OFFICE AND GAVE RUSSIANS SECRETS

169
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,235
ABOUT THE ISRAELIS BEING

170
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:31,671
EMBEDDED AND WAYS IN WHICH THE

171
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,572
ISLAMIC TERRORISTS --

172
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,073
>> Laura: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

173
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:35,975
THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR THAT IS

174
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:38,411
ON THIS NETWORK TONIGHT THAT

175
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,646
MADE COMMENTS THAT WERE -- A RUN

176
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,215
OF THE MIDDLE PUNDIT ON ANY

177
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,249
CABLE NETWORK WOULD KNOW THE

178
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:45,318
ANSWERS TO, WHICH I FOUND

179
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:45,751
UNBELIEVABLE.

180
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,587
I WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER SOUND

181
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:47,887
BITE.

182
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,089
THIS IS ON THE FISA APPLICATION

183
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:50,623
ITSELF.

184
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:52,491
BYRON, YOU'VE WROTE ABOUT THIS.

185
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:53,993
CONGRESSMAN, YOU'VE BEEN

186
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:54,694
DISSECTING THIS.

187
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:55,461
LET'S WATCH.

188
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:58,364
>> CALL THE DOSSIER UNVERIFIED,

189
00:05:58,364 --> 00:05:58,731
SALACIOUS.

190
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,533
WHY DID YOU USE THAT TO THE FISA

191
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,302
COURT TO ASK FOR SURVEILLANCE

192
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:04,470
FOR CARTER PAGE?

193
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,073
YOU LED WITH IT, A BULK OF THE

194
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:09,375
FISA APPLICATION DEALS WITH THAT

195
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:09,775
DOSSIER.

196
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:10,543
WHY?

197
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:14,981
>> THAT'S NOT MY RECOLLECTION,

198
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,249
BRET.

199
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:19,185
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE FISA

200
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:22,054
APPLICATION HAS BEEN RELEASED.

201
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:23,856
>> THERE WAS A LOT MORE THAN THE

202
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:26,025
DOSSIER IN THE FISA APPLICATION?

203
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,895
>> MY RECOLLECTION THERE WAS A

204
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:30,730
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME ABOUT

205
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,498
PAGE AND WHY THERE WAS PROBABLE

206
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,966
CAUSE THAT HE WAS AN AGENT.

207
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:34,834
>> IS THAT TRUE?

208
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:35,434
>> NO.

209
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:36,836
WHEN YOU LEAD WITH IT, THAT'S

210
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,271
YOUR PRIMARY EVIDENCE --

211
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,205
>> Laura: HAVE YOU SEEN THE

212
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:40,439
ENTIRE FISA APPLICATION?

213
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,507
>> WE HAVE NOT.

214
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:42,008
>> Laura: WHY?

215
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:47,246
>> THEY WON'T LET US.

216
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,482
I ASKED CHRISTOPHER WRAY.

217
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,850
THEY WON'T SHOW US.

218
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,851
>> Laura: WOW.

219
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,052
>> THEY DIDN'T TELL THE COURT

220
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:53,920
WHO PAID FOR IT.

221
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,087
THEY DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT

222
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,156
THE AUTHOR OF THE DOCUMENT,

223
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:59,392
CHRISTOPHER STEELE, HAD HIS

224
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:00,960
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FBI

225
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,360
TERMINATED.

226
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,495
THEY DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT.

227
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,397
WHEN WE GO TO THE COURT, WE HAVE

228
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:05,698
TO TELL THEM THE WHOLE TRUTH.

229
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:06,699
THEY DIDN'T TO THAT.

230
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,934
>> REMEMBER THE HOUSE INTEL

231
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,335
FOUND OUT THAT THE DOSSIER WAS

232
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:11,570
THE BULK OF IT AND SEPARATELY

233
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,972
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

234
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:17,310
ALSO FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS THE

235
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,910
BULK OF IT.

236
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,079
>> Laura: HE ALSO SAID HE DIDN'T

237
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,615
SEE ANY BIAS IN THE PAGE-STRZOK

238
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:25,051
TEXT WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE

239
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:26,285
INSURANCE POLICY.

240
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:27,853
THEY WERE CLEARLY NOT WILD ABOUT

241
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:28,287
DONALD TRUMP.

242
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:31,023
EVEN THAT'S BEEN SAID ON OTHER

243
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:31,390
NETWORKS.

244
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,792
BUT HE DIDN'T SEE ANY BIAS.

245
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,393
>> AGAIN, THERE WERE REPUBLICANS

246
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:36,529
ON THIS NETWORK AND OTHERS THAT

247
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,031
WERE SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT

248
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,933
DONALD TRUMP DURING THE 2016

249
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,535
CAMPAIGN THAT STRZOK WAS.

250
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,036
STRZOK WAS SAYING THE SAME

251
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:44,670
THINGS --

252
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,506
>> Laura: BUT NOT INVESTIGATING

253
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:47,773
HIM.

254
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:48,674
>> HE WAS SAYING THE SAME THING

255
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,509
ABOUT ERIC HOLDER.

256
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,211
THEY WERE DISHING DIRT OR

257
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:53,212
TRASHING EVERYBODY THEY COULD.

258
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,214
SO TO SUGGEST -- STRZOK WAS A

259
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,483
PERSON THAT SUGGESTED THAT COMEY

260
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:58,684
DO THE LETTER THAT BASICALLY WAS

261
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:02,054
THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR

262
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:02,521
HILLARY CLINTON.

263
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:03,656
I DON'T THINK --

264
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:05,992
>> IT WASN'T BIAS.

265
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:08,160
IT WAS ANIMUS TOWARDS THE

266
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,561
PRESIDENT.

267
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,430
PETER STRZOK IS THE DEPUTY HEAD

268
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,331
OF COUNTER INTELLIGENCE.

269
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:14,300
HE'S BEEN DEMOTED AND REASSIGNED

270
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,801
FOR HIS BEHAVIOR.

271
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:18,938
>> Laura: THE COLUMBIA LAW

272
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:20,272
PROFESSOR TO WHOM COMEY GAVE

273
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:23,275
THAT -- THOSE MEMOS, TWO OF THE

274
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:25,211
SIX MEMOS AND HE BASICALLY

275
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,980
INSTRUCTED HIM TO GET THEM OUT

276
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,280
THERE.

277
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,282
NOW WE FIND OUT, WHICH WE DIDN'T

278
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:31,650
KNOW, MAYBE YOU KNEW THIS, THAT

279
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,653
HE WAS ACTUALLY A SPECIAL

280
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:35,921
CONSULTANT TO THE JUSTICE

281
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:36,589
DEPARTMENT?

282
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,390
AND WE NOW FIND OUT THAT HE'S

283
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,894
NOW OPERATING AS COMEY'S

284
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:42,260
ATTORNEY.

285
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,195
>> HIS LAWYER.

286
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:45,431
>> Laura: IS THAT RELEVANT?

287
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,466
GIVES YOU ATTORNEY CLIENT

288
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,869
PRIVILEGE --

289
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,070
>> IT HELPS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

290
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,540
HE DID TO GET THE MEMOS OUT.

291
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,842
IT WAS A STUNNING RE-LATION.

292
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:58,310
COMEY DOES NOT CONSIDER WHAT HE

293
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,211
DID LEAKING.

294
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:02,782
HE HAS REDEFINED LEAKING TO MEAN

295
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:05,451
ONLY DISCLOSES CLASSIFIED

296
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:05,851
INFORMATION.

297
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,386
HE BELIEVES -- HE'S SAID SEVERAL

298
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:09,155
TIMES THAT HE DIDN'T LEAK WHEN

299
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:11,057
HE GAVE THIS MEMO TO DAN RICHMAN

300
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:12,792
FOR THE PURPOSE OF RICHMAN

301
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:13,592
TELLING THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

302
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:14,627
ABOUT IT.

303
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,128
COMEY MAINTAINS THAT THIS WAS

304
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:16,962
NOT A LEAK.

305
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:18,230
HE ALSO SAID IT COULDN'T HAVE

306
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,132
BEEN A LEAK BECAUSE HE LEFT THE

307
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:23,069
FBI AND WAS NO LONGER A

308
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:24,470
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE.

309
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,606
>> GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS WROTE A

00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:29,742
BOOK ABOUT CONVERSATIONS WITH

311
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,477
BILL CLINTON.

312
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:34,480
SCOTT McCLELLAND BROKE A BOOK --

313
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,848
>> AFTER THEY WERE OUT OF

314
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:36,182
OFFICE.

315
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,149
>> THAT'S THE CASE.

316
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,651
THAT COMEY WAS OUT OF OFFICE AND

317
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:43,089
HE WAS NO MORE OF A LEAKER THAN

318
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,343
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS OR Mc

319
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:47,660
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS OR M

320

McCLELLAND WAS.

321
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,031
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT KEPT

322
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:53,899
THEM AS IF THEY WERE STATE

323
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,233
SECRETS.

324
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,935
FEW MEMBERS WERE ALLOWED TO SEE

325
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:56,235
THEM.

326
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,670
YOU HAD DO HAVE AN FBI MINDER

327
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,104
WITH THEM.

328
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,172
NO NOTES, NO COPIES.

329
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,308
>> Laura: IT'S CONTRARY TO

330
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,609
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

331
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:04,710
REGULATIONS --

>> NOBODY ON CAPITOL HILL

333
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,247
BELIEVES THIS IS THE ONLY LEAK

334
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:09,415
THAT JAMES COMEY DID THERE

335
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:09,748
RICHMAN.

336
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:12,184
I MANY GUESS IS THERE WERE TONS.

337
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:15,354
HE HAD EMPLOYEES WITH THE SGE

338
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:15,688
STATUS.

339
00:10:15,688 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M GUESSING HE DID LOTS OF
