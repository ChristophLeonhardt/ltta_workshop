sorry can I say I really enjoy your
blog's but I have one slight problem
that's the quiz you did on your myspace
profile page I went I did that quiz and
I was extremely honest throughout and
you know the results came back and they
said that I was template and stable I'm
really offended instability suggests a
lot instability suggests that you're
insane you you're doing this whole
wah-wah thing with your phone and you
got like 60s I think this in I don't
even know how you came up with this it's
kind of like you're the guy that started
milking cows what the hell was he doing
anyway
yes my only complaint I don't like that
quiz
