after these claims are rejected what is your take on that are there other suspects or do you think it was it was a mistake to blame British intelligence for this end by the way my second question are there from time to time a tweet that you regret in inside very seldom very seldom and you would have so you never would have our hero not to have probably wouldn't be here right now but so very seldom we have a tremendous group of people that listen and I can get around the media when the media doesn't tell the truth so I like that as far as wiretapping I guess quite you know this past administration at least we have something in common perhaps and just to finish your question we said nothing all we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television I didn't make an opinion on it that was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox and so you shouldn't be talking to me you should be talking to Fox okay thank you
