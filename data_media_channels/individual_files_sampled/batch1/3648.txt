well look low costs in Europe started about 20 years ago and the big low-cost leaders in Europe Ryanair and easyJet they were founded back then my personal view is that for for especially the first decade of their existence network carriers like ourself sort of underestimated ignored almost arrogantly ignored the the rise of low-cost carriers with that we can see that their share on the European landscape has has steadily increased and it's now anywhere between 42 and 45 percent of all flights in europe are with low-cost carriers and a percentage which is significantly larger than in the US where it's about assert with that we have embarked on the program in KLM a few years ago whereby we sort of said we're going to defend our European Network and we're going to make sure that we do the right thing for our customers on the European Network so we have lowered our cost we have increased our fleet utilization we have changed our commercial offers on probably 60% of all our European destinations which are about 80 destinations we do have levels which are matching the low-cost low-cost carriers so this combination of cost-cutting on the one hand side investing you know in our product and our service you know we have coffee for free we're beer for free and if it's beer should be Dutch beer so we have we have all that stuff for our customers and yet at very competitive prices and with that we have been able to change our our European Network from a loss making situation into a profitable situation
