AFTER THE PROMISES OF MANY ADMINISTRATIONS AND PRESIDENTS THEY NEVER DID IT. THEY CAMPAIGNED AND PROMISED AND NEVER DID IT. NEXT WEEK WE'LL FINALLY OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS OPENING THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ENGINEER JER THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ENGINEER JES THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ENGINEER JEL THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ENGINEER JEM THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ENGINEER JE. HEAR WHAT THAT MEANS FROM PASTOR ROBERT JEFFERS. GOOD MORNING, SIR. GOOD MORNING. TELL US HOW YOU THOUGHT THROUGH THIS AS YOU PUT THE PRAYER TOGETHER. THIS ONE HAS SPECIAL MEANING. THEY ALL HAVE SPECIAL MEANING BUT THIS IS REMARKABLE. THIS IS A HISTORIC MOMENT BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM AS THE AMERICAN EMBASSY. SOMETHING THE BIBLE HAS TOLD US FOR YEARS. IF INDEED JERUSALEM HAS BEEN THE CAPITAL THAT BLOWS APART THAT THE JEWS STOLE THE LAND FROM THE PALESTINIANS SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THAT'S WHY THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. GENESIS 12 SAYS GOD WILL BLESS THOSE NATIONS THAT BLESS ISRAEL AND CURSE THOSE NATIONS THAT CURSE ISRAELS. THERE ARE MANY DEVOTE JEWS AND CHRISTIANS THAT ARE WILLING TO STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AND GOD ON THE ISSUE. THIS COMES AS A SUNSETLING TIME. THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IRAN.

IN 1995 THE CONGRESS SAID THEY WOULD MOVE THE EMBASSY. CLINTON, OBAMA, AND BUSH SAID THEY WOULD BUT BACKED AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP STUDIED THIS ISSUE. I REMEMBER TALKING TO HIM BEFORE AND AFTERWARDS. HERE GOT ALL KINDS OF INPUT. HE DECIDED HE WANTED TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AND GOD. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PROMISE MADE AND PROMISE KEPT. WHO AS IS GOING ON THE TRIP WITH YOU? A DELEGATION WITH STEVE. JARED, THERE WILL BE EIGHT HUNDRED GUESTS THERE. IT WILL START AT 4:00 P.M. JERUSALEM TIME. THIS WILL BE THE MOMENT 70 YEARS AGO WHEN THE MODERN STATE WAS REBORN. WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES THAT REBIRTH NEVER HAPPENED. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHY MANY OF US WHO ARE DEVOTE CREST DEVOTE CHRST DEVOTE CHRISTIANS AND JEWS. WE DECIDED TO BLESS ISRAEL. PASTOR, BE SAFE ON YOUR
