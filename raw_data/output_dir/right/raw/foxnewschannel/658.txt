1
00:00:00,465 --> 00:00:01,666
COUNTRIES MUST PAY MORE.

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:04,769
LESS.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,703
VERY UNFAIR.

4
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:10,975
PREVIEW OF HIS MESSAGE.

5
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:11,609
THE EUROPEAN UNION'S OPEN

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,310
BORDER POLICY HAS RESULTED

7
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:12,910
IN A MASSIVE INFLUX OF

8
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:13,778
MIGRANTS IN THE LAST FEW

9
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,179
YEARS, SURGES TO MORE THAN A

10
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,949
MILLION AT ITS PEAK.

11
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,983
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

12
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:21,152
THIS WEEK WE ARE TAKING A

13
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:22,453
CLOSER LOOK AT THE EU'S

14
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:23,621
IMMIGRATION CRISIS AND WHAT

15
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:24,755
AMERICA CAN LEARN FROM IT.

16
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:26,424
HERE TO START US OFF IS

17
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:27,558
FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT

18
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,759
PRESS OFFICER MORGAN OR

19
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,662
TELLING GAS.

20
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,264
MORGAN, THANKS THANKS FOR

21
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:34,131
JOINING US THIS MORNING.

22
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:34,832
>> HEY, PETE.

23
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,300
SEE THESE TWEETS FROM THE

24
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,668
PRESIDENT ON NATO.

25
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:38,603
THAT'S ONE ISSUE.

26
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:41,372
THE OTHER THING IS WHAT HAS

27
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:42,540
INSIDE THE BORDERLESS

28
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,741
COUNTRIES OF EUROPE SEEN

29
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,376
THIS INFLUX OF MIGRANTS.

30
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:51,716
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE HOW

31
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:53,584
HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF

32
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:54,352
INSURGENCY OF MIGRANTS.

33
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:55,820
>> PETE, LIKE ANY OF THESE

34
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,188
ISSUES DEALING WITH A

35
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,156
MIGRANT ISSUE IS INCREDIBLY

36
00:00:59,157 --> 00:00:59,523
COMPLEX.

37
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:01,125
IF YOU GO BACK TO 1985

38
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:02,193
THAT'S WHEN THE EUROPEAN

39
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:03,394
COUNTRIES HAD THE AGREEMENT

40
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:04,695
WHERE THEY AGREED TO

41
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:05,496
BASICALLY OPEN BORDERS.

42
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:11,469
WHERE YOU COULD HAVE TRAVEL

43
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,103
AND GOODS THROUGHOUT THE

44
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:16,240
EUROPEAN UNION WHERE DO THE

45
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:18,142
MIGRANTS COME FROM AND WHAT

46
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:19,210
ARE THE CONDITIONS CREATING

47
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:19,610
ALL OF THIS.

48
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,513
WITH THIS.

49
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,386
THE MIGRANTS COME FROM.

50
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:29,286
WHEN THAT HAPPENS ACCORDING

51
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,489
TO THE EU RULES YOU HAVE TO

52
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,456
SEEK ASYLUM IN THE FIRST

53
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:34,425
COUNTRIES YOU ENTER.

54
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:35,192
1.8 MILLION OVER THE LAST

55
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:36,427
FEW YEARS THAT HAVE CAME IN

56
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:37,395
SINCE WE HAVE SEEN THE

57
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:38,863
CRISIS IN SYRIA, LIBYA, AND

58
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:39,997
OTHER PLACES UNFOLD.

59
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:42,900
THEY ARE HAVING TO ABSORB

60
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,369
INCREDIBLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF

61
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,570
MIGRANTS.

62
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:47,238
PETE: ANOTHER COUNTRY

63
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,806
ABSORBING A LARGE AMOUNT OF

64
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:59,784
109,000 IN 2016.

65
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:00,418
OVER 172,000.

66
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,787
BIG PART OF THAT CIVIL WAR

67
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:03,120
INFLUX.

68
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:04,388
HAS EUROPE ADJUSTED TO THE

69
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:05,723
REALITY THAT THEIR

70
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:06,490
DEMOGRAPHICS ARE GOING TO

71
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:11,796
CHANGE IF THEY DON'T DEAL

72
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:12,329
WITH THEIR BORDERS?

73
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,963
>> I THINK THAT -- WE HAVE

74
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:13,631
SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS

75
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,298
THE NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN

76
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:14,865
QUITE DRAMATICALLY.

77
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:15,700
WE HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT

78
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,134
MORE RESOLUTION IN SYRIA,

79
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,202
ALTHOUGH THAT WAR GOES ON.

80
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,337
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN EUROPEAN

81
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,539
NATIONS MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH

82
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,973
NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO

83
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:24,675
TRY TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF

84
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:25,309
MIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY THE

85
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,177
NUMBER OF SMUGGLERS.

86
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,411
YOU SEE THE SAME THING YOU

87
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:29,346
SEE ON OUR BORDER, HUMAN

88
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:30,147
TRAFFICKERS TAKING ADVANTAGE

89
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:31,348
OF AN AWFUL SITUATION.

90
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,316
HERE'S WHERE I THINK THIS

91
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:33,684
MESSAGE TIES IN WITH WHAT

92
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:34,985
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING,

93
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:35,820
PETE, THAT IS SO IMPORTANT.

94
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,889
THE PRESIDENT IS URGING THE

95
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,658
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THESE

96
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,592
NATO COUNTRIES TO SPEND MORE

97
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,294
ON THEIR OWN DEFENSE.

98
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,161
IN 2012 I WAS SCREAMING

99
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,129
BECAUSE THEN PRESIDENT

100
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,763
BARACK OBAMA DID NOTHING

101
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,832
ABOUT SYRIA WHEN THEY

102
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:53,671
FAILED STATES LIKE SYRIA AND

103
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:59,143
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN LIBYA

104
00:02:59,144 --> 00:02:59,877
AND AFRICA, IF WE CHOOSE NOT

105
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:00,544
TO LEAD IN THESE COUNTRIES

106
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:01,145
AND HELP RESOLVE THESE

107
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:01,779
CRISIS THEN YOU WILL SEE

108
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:05,549
BECAUSE THERE IS A CIVIL WAR

109
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,486
GOING ON IN THEIR COUNTRY.

110
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:09,420
WHAT ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO

111
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:09,754
DO?

112
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:10,721
PETE: INTERESTING TO SEE HOW

113
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:11,589
NATO COUNTRIES RESPOND TO

114
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,557
THE CALL FOR INCREASING

115
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:14,258
THEIR DEFENSE BUDGETS.

116
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,593
>> THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

117
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:16,527
PETE: IS HE EXACTLY RIGHT.

118
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:17,695
THAT'S HOW YOU STRENGTHEN

119
00:03:17,696 --> 00:00:00,000
THE ALLIANCE.
