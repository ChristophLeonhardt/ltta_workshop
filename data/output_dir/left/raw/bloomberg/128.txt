1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,590
There's a school of thought that the U.S.
doesn't need to do its own manufacturing.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,309
Why make stuff in the U.S. if it can be imported
more cheaply from abroad?

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,570
One answer is jobs.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,209
But there's another big reason.

5
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,600
Manufacturing in America is a matter of national
security.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,750
The United States is at risk if potential
enemies suddenly stop supplying parts for

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,890
weapons systems.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,410
The big five defense contractors depend on
technology and manufacturing know-how developed

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,700
by the civilian sector.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,850
And the U.S. civilian manufacturing base is
gradually eroding.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,420
This is forcing the defense sector to look
overseas at times for the parts it needs…

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,570
Free-trade agreements DO allow for purchases
from close allies.

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,629
The Pentagon can also grant waivers from the
"Buy American Act" when contractors can't

14
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:52,219
find what they need in the U.S..

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:58,149
But there’s a problem, the world’s biggest
manufacturer is also an emerging military

16
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,489
rival – China.

17
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,739
Federal law prohibits the Pentagon from buying
weapons or parts from China.

18
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,790
But that's getting tougher to avoid because
China simply dominates the market for some

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,790
critical components.

20
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,320
Take printed circuit boards, which go into
military systems from missiles to ships to

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
trucks.

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,470
A Defense Department report says China makes
close to half of the world’s printed circuit

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,470
boards.

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,350
China is also slowly building strength in
other electronics, including semiconductors.

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,180
And it's the largest producer of a chemical
compound used in detonators

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,130
for over 200 kinds of munitions.

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,950
Without singling out China, the Pentagon warns
that if key parts aren’t made in America,

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,140
the U.S. risks supply disruption, theft of
its technology, or even sabotage.

29
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,750
The trouble is, buy-American laws can also
make domestic manufacturers inefficient and

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,710
expensive by shielding them from competition.

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:00:00,000
and the U.S. already spends more on its military
than the next eight countries combined.
