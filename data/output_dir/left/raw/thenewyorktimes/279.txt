00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:07,040
Highpoint Church

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,560
at all of our locations,

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,901
Everybody watching online,

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,681
I want you to know
that we love you

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:20,220
in an incredible way.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,850
And we are sincerely

7
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:28,005
sorry

8
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,910
for any dishonor —

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,670
As a kid growing
up in the church,

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,920
I really looked up to
the church leaders.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,870
If you’re a guest, I’m
very sorry that you’re

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,990
having to hear about
a difficult subject.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,760
But I do pray —

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,640
These were the
people to emulate.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,300
Only love covers a
multitude of sins.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,210
Andy is going to come and
share with us at this time.

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,630
The only apology, if you
can even call it that,

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,380
was when he ran out of the
truck screaming, oh my god.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,890
Oh my god.

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,360
What have I done?

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,050
You have to take this
to the grave with you.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,160
Love you.

23
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,750
I’m going to sit,
if that’s all right.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,050
Forgive me that I’m going
to read something to you.

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,720
That is not my normal flow.

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,420
I called my mom and
asked her if it was OK

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,550
if Andy gave me a ride home.

28
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,410
And she said yes.

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,990
I want to read
this partly to make

30
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,450
sure I say what I
intended to say,

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,210
and also to help me get
through what I need to say.

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,900
He passed the turn
to go to my house.

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,820
And I honestly
thought we were going

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,120
to TCBY to get frozen yogurt.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,510
I don’t want reading this
to minimize anything.

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,330
I’ve never wanted
to minimize anything

37
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,680
about what’s taken place.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,570
Then he turned down a dark
dirt road off the main road.

39
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,610
As a college student
on staff at a church

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,590
in Texas more than
20 years ago —

41
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,050
I just remember him
unzipping his pants

42
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,550
and asking me if I
would suck his dick.

43
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,280
If I would give him a blow job.

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,320
I regretfully had
a sexual incident

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,390
with a female high school
senior in the church.

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,650
I looked up to him.

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,410
I trusted him.

48
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,590
So when he asked
me to do that,

49
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,610
I thought,

50
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,590
this must mean
he loves me.

51
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,430
This is a man of
God I look up to.

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,320
I apologized and
sought forgiveness

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,530
from her, her parents, her
discipleship group, the church

54
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,020
staff, and the
church leadership.

55
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,320
What happened was a crime.

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,290
This is not something
that the church

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,230
should handle internally.

58
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,190
I remember asking, well,
what’s going to happen now?

59
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,460
And they just said that
the church would handle it.

60
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,520
Andy Savage was still teaching.

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,330
In agreement with
wise counsel,

62
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,740
I took every step to
respond in a biblical way.

63
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,780
And I’m just aching
inside because nobody’s

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,530
doing anything.

65
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,590
Once I had told more people,
then they had to act.

66
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,500
I resigned from ministry and
moved back home to Memphis.

67
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,040
I accepted full
responsibility for my actions.

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,010
Andy was allowed to
go before the church

69
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,150
and basically say that
he had made a mistake

70
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,030
and that it was time
for him to move on.

71
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,810
I did not attend that
service, nor did I

72
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,250
attend the going-away party that
they had for him afterwards.

73
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,430
I was and remain very
remorseful for the incident

74
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,280
and deeply regret the pain
I caused her and her family,

75
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,730
as well as the pain I caused
the church and God’s kingdom.

76
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,180
People were celebrating him,
and showering him with love,

77
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,320
and telling him how
much they’ll miss him.

78
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,520
And here I am struggling.

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,710
I further disclosed this
incident to Chris Conlee

80
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,860
before coming on
staff at Highpoint

81
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,700
and have shared with key leaders
throughout my tenure here.

82
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,460
This incident was dealt
with in Texas 20 years ago.

83
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,890
He calls it an incident.

84
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:52,250
He brings up how it was 20
years ago so many times.

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,130
When this happened
20-plus years ago,

86
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,950
I did everything I knew to do
under the counsel I was given

87
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,550
to cooperate with those
involved, to repent of my sins,

88
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,220
take responsibility for my
actions, and seek forgiveness.

89
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,410
I never sought to cover this up.

90
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,690
Because nobody was saying the
severity of what had happened,

91
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,270
I was being blamed.

92
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,960
It was, in their eyes,
a consensual sexual sin.

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,280
In hindsight, I see that more
could have been done for Jules.

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,250
I am truly sorry
more was not done.

95
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,960
Until now, I did
not know there was

96
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,030
unfinished business with Jules.

97
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,800
So today, I say, Jules, I am
deeply sorry for my actions

98
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,040
20 years ago.

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,130
We as a church of all places
should be getting this right.

100
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,460
It’s unfathomable to me that
the secular world, Hollywood,

101
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,530
are taking a stand.

102
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,930
The church should have
been the first group

103
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,550
to stand up and say,
we will not allow this.

104
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,510
My repentance over
this sin 20 years ago

105
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,880
was done believing that
God’s forgiveness is

106
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,240
greater than any sin.

107
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,725
And I still believe that.

108
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:08,210
Amen.

109
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,710
I want our churches to change
how they handle sexual assault

110
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,450
and sexual abuse in the church.

111
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,000
It’s a crime, not
just a sexual sin.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,040
For any painful
memories or fresh wounds

113
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,730
this has created for
anyone, I am sorry.

114
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,390
And I humbly ask for
your forgiveness.

115
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,730
I love you all very much.

116
00:06:33,730 --> 00:00:00,000
[applause]
