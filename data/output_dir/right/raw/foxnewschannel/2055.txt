I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD

54
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:31,670
MORE AGGRESSIVELY NOW THAT

55
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,837
WE HAVE A PLATFORM THAT HAVE

56
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:34,306
BEEN PROVEN TO HELP YOUNG

57
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:41,379

00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,082
THINK IT'S ROCKET SCIENCE,

60
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:45,784
IT'S NOT.

61
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:47,152
TRANSLATE CONTENT TO CTION A

62
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:48,220

63
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,954
PEOPLE WILL DO IT.

64
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:52,624
GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION.

65
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:54,626
WHEN WE IGNORE CHILDREN AND

66
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,560
LET SOCIAL MEDIA PULL THEM

67
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,995
APART FROM EACH OTHER, WE

68
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:57,963
DON'T REALIZE WE'RE AURAL

69
00:01:57,963 --> 00:01:58,997
LIKE RAINDROPS FALLING INTO

70
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,665
THE OCEAN OF HUMANITY.

71
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:03,034
THAT OCEAN IS ALSO IN

72
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:03,401
RAINDROPS.

73
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,169
WE HAVE TO BE OPEN WITH

74
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,104
THESE ISSUES.

75
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:07,672
BRIAN: NOT JUST CEREMONIAL

76
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:08,406

00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:08,773
SOMETHING.

78
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:09,808

ISSUES OF HEALTH.

84
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,383
WE ARE LOSING THE BATTLE

85
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:19,217
WITH OUR CHILDREN.

86
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,518
WE CAN NOT MORTGAGE THE

87
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:21,720
FUTURE OF THIS NATION BY NOT

88
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,455

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT.

96
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:32,063

97
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:32,664
STEVE: AIRPLANE COFFEE.

98
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:33,531

99
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:35,133
A BUNCH OF REPORTS ON THE

100
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,268
WATER IN THE PLANES NOT

101
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:37,135
BEING CLEAN.

102
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:38,136
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DRINK

103
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:39,471
THE WATER OUT OF THE FAUCET

105
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:41,406
THAT THE COFFEE YOU DRINK

106
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,707
DOES COME FROM THAT WATER.

107
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:44,342
BUT WE DID OUR OWN LITTLE

108
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:44,643
STUDY.

109
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,044
