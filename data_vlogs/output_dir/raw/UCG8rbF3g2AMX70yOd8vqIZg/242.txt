you may have made a different song
because I know I made it and I started

303
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
elaborating so he gets it in his mind I
said that it's not the third verse ha that's a

304
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,060
different song you don't have a first or
second verse how can you have a third verse
