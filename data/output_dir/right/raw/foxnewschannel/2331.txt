1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,410
REPUBLICANS.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,711
THEN PICKED UP -- IMPORTANT

3
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,213
THING WAS PICKED UP BY

4
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:04,914
DEMOCRATS OPPOSED TO DONALD

5
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:06,882
TRUMP.

6
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,717
>> Judge: JOINING US NOW FOR

7
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,185
REACTION IS FOX NEWS

8
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,487
CONTRIBUTOR HERMAN CAIN AND

9
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:12,621
FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN MATT

10
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:12,922
GAETZ.

11
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:13,789
ALL RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN, I'M

12
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:14,890
GOING TO ASK YOU FIRST.

13
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,325
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS

14
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,527
NEW REPORT BY THE INTEL

15
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:19,995
COMMITTEE, THE REPUBLICAN

16
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:20,996
MAJORITY, ACTUALLY?

17
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:23,299
>> WELL, THIS REPORT IS A

18
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,567
DECISIVE WIN FOR THE

19
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,401
PRESIDENT BECAUSE IT

20
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:26,168
SUPPORTS WHAT THE PRESIDENT

21
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:27,803
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG.

22
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:30,406
AND THAT IS THAT RUSSIANS

23
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:33,075
HAD A GREATER INVOLVEMENT

24
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:33,442
GLAFTING.

25
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,810
HILLARY CLINTON FUNDED

26
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,445
CHRISTOPHER STEELE AUTHORED

27
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:37,546
DOSSIER THAN THEY EVER HAD

28
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:38,747
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

29
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,182
NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION

30
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,585
STILL AND FRANKLY JUDGE

31
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:43,552
JEANINE, THIS POINTS OUT THE

32
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:45,187
NEED TO DISBAND THE MUELLER

33
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:45,988
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE IT'S

34
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:47,890
BUILT ON A ROTTEN PREMISE

35
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,060
THAT HAS NOW BEEN DISPROVEN

36
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,695
WITH 250 PAGES OF FACT.

37
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:54,196
>> Judge: ALL RIGHT.

38
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:55,464
AND HERMAN CAIN TO YOU, THAT

39
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:56,865
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS

40
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,133
LATEST REPORT FROM THE INTEL

41
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:58,500
COMMITTEE?

42
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,569
>> MY TAKE, JUDGE JEANINE,

43
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:02,137
IS THAT HE IS NOT IN HOT

44
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:02,972
WATER.

45
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:07,209
HE LIED AND LIED AND LIED.

46
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:07,676
>> Judge: COMEY?

47
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:08,644
>> AND NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT

48
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:10,179
FOR THE PROCESS TO PLAY

49
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:10,946
ITSELF OUT.

50
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:11,947
COMEY I'M TALKING ABOUT.

51
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,349
WE NOW HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE

52
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:14,817
PROCESS TO PLAY ITSELF OUT

53
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:17,987
FOR HIM TO END UP IN COURT

54
00:01:17,987 --> 00:01:20,689
SUCH THAT A COURT JUDGMENT

55
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,691
PROVES THAT HE LIED AND

56
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,693
TRIED TO KEEP A CLOUD OVER

57
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,261
THIS ADMINISTRATION.

58
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:27,563
HE AND OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO

59
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,965
KEEP A CLOUD OVER THIS

60
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,900
ADMINISTRATION BUT WITH THIS

61
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,469
REPORT, THE CLOUDS HAVE

62
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,838
PARTED AND NOW WE'RE SEEING

63
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:37,106
THE TRUTH AND THAT'S WHAT

64
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,073
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANTED

65
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,675
TO SEE.

66
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:40,876
>> Judge: YOU KNOW, WHAT'S

67
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:41,910
INTERESTING, HERMAN, IS THAT

68
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,012
EVEN THOUGH YOU SAY THAT WE

69
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,413
WANT TO SEE THE COURTS GET

70
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:44,780
INVOLVED.

71
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,849
THE TRUTH IS THAT THE

72
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:47,950
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT

73
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,118
WAS SUPPOSED TO COME OUT IN

74
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:50,152
APRIL REGARDING COMEY.

75
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,286
NOW THEY SAY MAY.

76
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:53,255
AND PROBABLY EVEN LATER THAN

77
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:53,722
THAT.

78
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:54,523
CHRISTOPHER STEELE, THERE

79
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:56,458
WAS A REFERENCE BECAUSE HE

80
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,393
LIED TO THE FBI.

81
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,294
I BELIEVE WAS CHAIRMAN

82
00:01:59,294 --> 00:01:59,962
GRASSLEY'S COMMITTEE WHO

83
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,797
MADE A CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO

84
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:03,032
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

85
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:04,366
MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO,

86
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,200
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

87
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,370
WE KNEW MCCABE LIED OVER

88
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,604
MORE THAN SEVERAL MONTHS

89
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:10,005
AGO.

90
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,273
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

91
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:12,107
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING

92
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:12,675
TO TAKE?

93
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,243
I THINK THEY ARE

94
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:16,011
SLOW-WALKING THE DOCUMENTS

95
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:16,979
WE DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE.

96
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,214
SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET

97
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:21,050
PAST 2018, CHANGE THE HOUSE.

98
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,252
>> I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH

99
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:23,519
YOU.

100
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,988
THEY ARE TRYING TO SLOW-WALK

101
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:27,156
THIS CLOUD.

102
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:30,292
SLOW WALK THESE

103
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:30,759
INVESTIGATIONS.

104
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,328
SUCH THAT THEY GET THROUGH

105
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,363
NOVEMBER 2018.

106
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,498
BUT HERE'S THE THING, JUDGE

107
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:37,132
JEANINE.

108
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,734
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

109
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,669
INCLUDING SOME DEMOCRATS,

110
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,404
ARE NOT STUPID.

111
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:44,573
WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE

112
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:47,710
COME OUT EVEN THROUGH THE

113
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,911
MEDIA THAT SAYS HE HAS LIED

114
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:51,080
AND DISCREDITED HIMSELF AND

115
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,781
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SWALLOW

116
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,516
THE GULLABLE LIES THAT THE

117
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,018
DEMOCRATS AND THE LIBERALS

118
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:56,852
ARE TRYING TO PUSH ON THE

119
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:57,553
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

120
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,388
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SLOW

121
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,789
WALK THIS ONE.

122
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,791
BECAUSE WHEN AN AG REPORT

123
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,492
COMES OUT.

124
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:04,560
IT'S GOING TO BE THE ICING

125
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,528
ON THE CAKE.

126
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,063
>> CONGRESSMAN GATES YOU

127
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,498
ENDED BY SAYING YOUR LAST

128
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:11,533
COMMENT THAT IT'S TIME FOR

129
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,167
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

130
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,402
MUELLER'S GROUP TO BE

131
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:13,836
DISBANDED.

132
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,938
BUT, TODAY, OR YESTERDAY, I

133
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:17,906
BELIEVE IT WAS CHAIRMAN

134
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,341
GRASSLEY OF THE SENATE

135
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:20,809
JUDICIARY WHO LET A BILL OUT

136
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,211
OF COMMITTEE SUPPORTED BY A

137
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:24,413
FEW REPUBLICANS LIKE LINDSEY

138
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,714
GRAHAM SAYING THEY ARE GOING

139
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:30,119
TO BLOCK THE PRESIDENT FROM

140
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,186
FIRING MUELLER AND

141
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:31,887
DISBANDING THE COMMISSION.

142
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:34,690
I MEAN, ON THE ONE HAND WE

143
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,724
HAVE YOU SAYING ONE THING

144
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:37,426
AND GRASSLEY SAYING ANOTHER.

145
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,129
WHY IS GRASSLEY WASTING HIS

146
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,263
TIME WITH THIS KIND OF A

147
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:41,563
BILL.

148
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:42,898
>> WELL, SENATOR GRASSLEY

149
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:43,932
HAS DONE A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE

150
00:03:43,932 --> 00:00:00,000
TO OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE
