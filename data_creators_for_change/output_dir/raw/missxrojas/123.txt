adventures in fairy bread these are all

48
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,159
the little sprinkles or as i like to

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,070
call them tiny annoying balls that I

50
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,720
dipped my face in and this is the

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,960
English muffin situation and these were

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
the strawberries the raspberries I

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,170
didn't eat because they were covered in

54
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,630
fluff and if you can see the fluff but

55
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,399
it's in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's disgusting this</font>

56
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,570
is the champagne I drank when we got to

57
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,729
500,000 and that's all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> washing up I</font>

58
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,560
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do because I have abandoned</font>

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,699
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the project for awesome</font>

60
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,550
for 48 hours including my plants which

61
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,050
now slightly dying

62
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,870
tree is looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> great I think very happy</font>

63
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,760
with decision to buy tree I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
talk a little bit while I prepare my

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,810
potato which I'm completely going to

66
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,930
ruin and must say and about arts and

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,450
crafts because I mean firstly how much

68
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,070
fun is it to do art projects like a

69
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,900
little kid in kind of like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Art</font>

70
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Attack way that you sort of wanted to do</font>

71
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,010
and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more like their own</font>

72
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,590
a bit more like an authority on it when

73
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,150
you do when you were little but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

74
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,430
know how to actually use equipment

75
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,860
saying that I'm making the wonky asst

76
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,690
Christmas tree I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't ever made in my</font>

77
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,030
life I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ate another potato I'm</font>

78
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,740
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I factor with that when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I switch</font>

79
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,600
the arts check these<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have like</font>

80
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,830
the really cool equipment and everything

81
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,440
and both cool slightly you know you

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,940
don't have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your house so we</font>

83
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,320
would make do and my mom's really

84
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,510
resourceful because she I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's</font>

85
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,510
very artistic herself she's so talented

86
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,370
but she's also she's to be a restorer

87
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,040
and she select restore and you know

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,220
ceramics and things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

89
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,910
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> China that's what stuff and she</font>

90
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,950
can do it with like the most minimal

91
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,230
materials it's really impressive but you

92
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,940
just tremendously resourceful overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

93
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,300
have found that like and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

94
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,590
a real sense of like when I'm being

95
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,420
wasteful and what I'm not many ways to

96
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,070
like for example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I discard a potato</font>

97
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,530
because if it's in Syria I'm a Christmas

98
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,180
tree I'll make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one into a star or</font>

99
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,590
something shows like The Art Attack was

100
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,000
so fun because in a way they were

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,850
wasteful and carefree and as much as

102
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">they were like super effective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show</font>

103
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,070
you guys in a second this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

104
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,470
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a tree into this potato</font>

105
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,120
I've always loved drawing things like

106
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,590
that but when I started having to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

107
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,070
at school<font color="#E5E5E5"> for GCSE one of the juices but</font>

108
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,330
for before that in secondary school

109
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,250
really and started being assessed in it

110
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,230
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just completely like I stopped drawing</font>

111
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,660
I've stopped in dude learning I just

112
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,860
hated

113
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,930
really did not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

114
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,030
felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we know art shouldn't be</font>

115
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,070
taught or anything like that it was more

116
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,900
because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there wasn't</font>

117
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,130
enjoying it the second it became

118
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,710
something that was examined every single

119
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,380
aspect of the joy of making things just

120
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,390
flew<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> window for me and I</font>

121
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,130
didn't feel the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like English</font>

122
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,770
which is my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject or even</font>

123
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,480
Spanish or anything like that or drama

124
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,700
but for some reason with art I was just

125
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,560
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't working for me so I</font>

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,020
dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> out after a year nine so when I</font>

127
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,720
was 13 14 or something like that around

128
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,950
the time that I side<font color="#E5E5E5"> this YouTube</font>

129
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,240
channel and then I immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> light</font>

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,770
began drawing again and began making

131
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,750
things again and just had so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

132
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and just that really relaxed</font>

133
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,690
about it in a way that I had it for a

134
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,060
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time this is why we're at right now</font>

135
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I've got it even out the side so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

136
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,500
know if not even just gonna clarify the

137
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,190
sides using a very sharp knife so if you

138
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,070
are you know you might need parental

139
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,560
supervision of some sort would do

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
anything anything make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

141
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,330
grown-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there to help you I just cut</font>

142
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,280
off the side of my tree again and the

143
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,610
worst of this I'm so fat I think that's

144
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side of that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

145
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">my knee to immediately say that I'm who</font>

146
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,500
was something and I'm terrible just when

147
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,960
I hit a little bump and when I'm making

148
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,240
something and just like oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

149
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you saw me make a for the live stream</font>

150
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,840
it's really frustrating when I I find it

151
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,880
really difficult when I messed up when

152
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,220
I'm making something and I felt like I

153
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,620
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really able to mess up especially</font>

154
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,500
not would be examined aspect of it even

155
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,270
though really I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do too</font>

156
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,210
badly in terms of them grading and

repetitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> prints are and how easy it is</font>

188
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,900
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make something quite simple and basic</font>

are all about taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time and the</font>

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,550
moment it becomes the very like mass

195
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,950

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,480
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't the fire hazard I would</font>

put candles on my treat that sort of

200
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,410

210
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,250

212

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,670
counter but sometimes when I'm like

241

really overwhelmed or partner you clean

242
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,350

task gets too big to complete and yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

244
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,180
the same time I must complete<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

245
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,510

252
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,930

let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say relaxing guys I cannot</font>

267
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,430
recommend crafting enough you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

274
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,540
end my perfectionism is more about

275
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,210
completing things than it is about

276
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,170
