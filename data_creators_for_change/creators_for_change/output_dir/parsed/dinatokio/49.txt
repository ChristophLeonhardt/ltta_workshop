damn town that's it guys for my calendar
you can't lie that that is worth the
money some of them were sample but some
of them were decent proper sizes and if
you add up or how much all of this cost
together it's definitely worth more than
50 quid yeah my own mines quite sick you
would have shown from my mind
well that's what you're just some of it
just some but do you know what's funny
about this 20% off I'm gonna sound like
a proper Paki right now but if you read
the terms and conditions on the back its
if you spend over 500 pounds are you
having a what you're really after this
over there but ain't nobody gonna spend
500 pounds 20 with the bump okay yo

on there for a minute and I wash it off
and all my dry skin how does it work
that's one
it's like washing up liquid on dishes in
it no it's gotta be some sort of
chemicals in there they eat the upper
layer so obviously like watch that's why
