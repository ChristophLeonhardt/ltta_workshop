Robert Costa I'm gonna play for our audience the moment heard round the world from Meet the Press this weekend we'll talk about it on the other side I'm not gonna be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury and when you tell me that you know he should testify because he's gonna tell the truth that he shouldn't worry well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth not the truth he didn't have a a conversation this crowd I don't be to go like I know it isn't truth truth isn't truth so Robert is that just the era we've entered where the president's lawyer can go on television and say things without consequence of course Brian it's a bizarre statement but putting that aside and acknowledging it for what it is it's more revealing about how the Trump legal team feels about the Comey firing they there are uncomfortable publicly about having the president sit down for an interview with Robert Moore to talk through the president's intent was it corrupt was a criminal that's what the Moller people have wanted to find out for months and Giuliani's contesting that already contestants come with version to the story that's there publicly but not all Giuliani does not know the extent of what witnesses have said beyond mr. Comey about the Comey firing and what went on inside of the White House and different things about the president's intent and so when he says truth is truth he's saying he doesn't want to go up against a commis version of the story but there are more versions of this story than just Comey Joyce just as a fellow practitioner as a fellow lawyer when you hear an attorney use a phrase like that your reaction it tells me that he knows his client doesn't have a traditional legal defense they won't be able to offer when Bob Moeller finally produces his report or perhaps a new batch of indictments they won't be able to say the facts that are being alleged or untrue it appears that that's a near certainty and so instead they'll have to fall back on a defense of the Moller team as corrupt and you can't believe anything about facts there's no longer any rational truth because it's all a he-said she-said this is really a dangerous place to be Giuliani knows that this is not our courts function our courts are uniquely suited to ferret out the difference when we you have people telling these oppositional stories that's what prosecutors do for a living that's what Rudy Giuliani did for a living unfortunately now he's just reduced to shilling for a president who may not have a leg to stand on at the end of the day hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
