it's been called the worst man-made disaster since world war two seven years on from the start of the Syrian civil war is there any hope for a solution and an end to the violence that's our debate Syria has been described as one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time more than five million people have fled the country hundreds of thousands have lost their lives and yet the war continues Syrian civilians have been under fire in areas like Eid Lib and eastern Goethe and even though some say Bashar al-assad and his allies seem to have defeated the rebels there is no clear political solution in sight so what has to happen to bring the fighting and suffering to an end joining me in the arena to debate this are Mara Colin senior fellow at Brookings and a former top Pentagon official under President Obama Alexi klebanov a Middle East expert at the Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow and from Ankara Syrian journalist and activist Rami Jarrah thank you all for joining me on upfront Rami let me start with you it's been more than seven years since the Arab Spring failed in Syria war broke out but given the Bashar al Assad with Russian and Iranian support seems to have regained control of the majority of his country is it coming to a close has the Syrian regime won I think to answer that you'd have to focus on the fact that if we were saying that winning the game was meeting the aspirations of the people of Syria then that wouldn't be the case but if we're talking about this political game and gaining that stronghold in Syria and maintaining power for the near future then that's definitely the case Alexei klebanov hundreds of thousands dead millions displaced from their homes is this really a victory for a sad or should I say for Assad and Putin well so if we all agree that Russia's major goal was to back up existing Syrian institutions in regime to significantly to eliminate copulative of terrorists in Syria then of course that was successful and is successful story but if you look at this as a political solution that the ultimate goal is the political solution then of course the contact is really far from over and I think this this year is going to be quite challenging for all parties involved internally and externally as well Mari you said at a recent US congressional hearing that quote Assad won his war to stay in power a lot of people would say that's because of the United States and its refusal to get more involved in getting rid of him is that fair or not I think the United States played a role the international community more broadly played a role the timing of the conflict in the throes of other conflicts erupting and uprisings across the region no doubt also did too and frankly those inside Syria have their own agency you know this idea though of what Assad wins is a pretty interesting one to think about he's no doubt won a long-term insurgency even as he tries to take more and more control of Syrian territory he's also won some sort of interesting dynamics with the Russians the Iranians and Hezbollah how does they what do they see is there a long-term goal in Syria what do they plan to do what sort of weapon systems do they want to keep in Syria what sort of military presence what sort of activities do they want to launch from Syria so his winning is not an entirely positive affair even in his eyes I suspect but you worked in the Pentagon during the Obama era would you call Syria his biggest failure President Obama's biggest failure I think on the foreign policy front absolutely Rami how did we get to this stage where did when you know when you allocate responsibility or blame for the position Syria finds itself in today Assad still in power violence still continuing rebel groups still divided where do you place the blame if is there a hierarchy of blame that you have in your head in in Syria now what you have is a segment of society that has been banished from society and it is one that refuses not to have a voice in Syria and it's it's been labeled as being a fundamentalist group that is not accepted in society or is considered in in any in any form of it refusing to accept the the standards in this country means that it's it's that they're terrorists so I think that well what the Maine we have in Syria is the labels that have been been granted to everyone and those labels being accepted on an international level if you look at existing parties in Europe that now support Assad but openly saying that they support a dictator whereas if any one individual across Europe said that they supported Hitler they could face trial whereas now it's okay to say that you support a dictate that it has killed 570 what would you say driven half of the country that's fine who said on this show in March 2016 that there were quote no good guys in the Syrian tragedy ie pointing out yes Assad's a monster but there have been some pretty serious mini monsters faced up against him I would say that it took a very long time until there was an actual I don't think we actually even saw an intervention at any stage there was no serious approach to solving the problem in Syria I think that it was I think that there were many interests of the countries involved that was standing on the sidelines and watching - seeing what was going to happen and maybe hoping that there would be turmoil in the Middle East and they let this this this problem go on for way too long Alice is the reason where we are Alexei is another reality yes there may be quote-unquote terrorists amongst the opposition but there are an awful lot of innocent people who just want their freedom from Assad that hasn't changed over seven years and yet your country's air force has joined Assad's air force in bombing and killing those people a lot of whom just want freedom well firstly there are no Saints in in any war that's the first thing secondly yes Russia joined not asset as an individual but the the Russia supports the existing institutions and state structures and primarily it's the Armed Forces who are able to fight on the ground against terrorists secondly yes Russian air forces are participating in in this campaign against terrorists which which is called mainly they're taking Isis and define a new Sara targets but yes there are some claims which are not in factually proven that Russian Jets were like part of the offense of Eastern Goethe which is not the case for example Alexei you know there's a long list of human rights groups including UN officials who say Russian aircraft have used unguided bombs including blast weapons in densely populated civilian areas and may have committed war crimes in those civilian areas you know that there's plenty of reports documenting yes of course I've heard about those reports yes and I mean as I already mentioned there are no Saints in in in any war and especially in the Civil War when there is a bombing campaign we've heard lots of times when terrorists use civilians as a civilian shields on and used hospitals and the universities and schools packed with kids as a human shields so yes this is of course the case and this tragedies happens in Syria for for the last year's Maher when we when we look at the sum total of violence in Syria right now the United States isn't a problem for the United States that you rightly accused Russia of killing civilians in Syria that's well-documented but the US has been doing its own bombing campaign in Syria and in Iraq in which hundreds of coalition airstrikes have killed according to one air war study more civilians than Russian air strikes did at the beginning of last year in the first three months of 2017 look there's no equivalency whatsoever the Russian regime works hand in hand with Assad and his regime and that has been clearly illustrated and it preceded Isis no doubt well you are seen at least at the American side fighting it is trying to subtract I against groups like Isis it is trying to support civilians as much as possible absolutely a lot of civilians at one stage more than the Russians between January April last year civilian casualties have absolutely occurred on the US side and they have been a tragedy they are regularly investigated by the US military there's an a questioning of procedures rules of engagement and what needs to change it seems as though when you look at how the Russian military is operated in Syria that actually civilian casualties may be part and parcel of its strategy I don't think so simply because it's not in Russia's interest because it's it's absolutely not true that it's civilian casualties collateral damage is a part of Russia's strategy in Syria Terry is just pretty incompetent I mean it's been pretty clear Russia's military has tried to use Syria is it taz its tactical and operational battleground to test its weapons to give its military personnel a bit of practice that's not the initial reason for going in Syria of course it's during during the campaign you test the weapon as well you test your arms systems on the ground in in a real combat ok yes of course but it's not coming in a reason it's not the driver of Russia's involvement in Syria it's absolutely not sure what you're saying Russia's involvement in Syria since it intervened I mean I'm one of the people that was in Aleppo and I documented the Russian airstrikes we watch closely I think there was a group called Belen cat that had actually found pictures that were released by the by the by the military and by the foreign ministry Russian Foreign Ministry that said that they had targeted Isis they were in these images and those images were actually residential homes in central Epple where there were no signs of Isis and this happened a number of times so Russia the thing is that Russia plays this bigger brother role where if anything goes wrong then it can say that you know this is acid doing this they know the amount of civilians that are being killed they have this data I think they have more data than the Syrians themselves do so they know exactly what Assad is doing and they have they share a responsibility in the crimes that are being committed maura isn't it the case president obama was considering ISIL as the bigger threat and therefore that was one of the main reasons he didn't go all-in as some of his advisors wanted to in terms of no-fly zones or greater weaponry to the rebels and they were already sending etc ISIL shifted the conversation at that moment in time I don't think it was because of ISIL that he did not go all in that decision had already occurred in some way but instead it was ISIL is the near term no kidding serious problem we are still profoundly concerned about what is going on with the Assad regime so it was not mutually exclusive per se but in terms of prioritization ISIL had to be that one let me put that same question to Rami do you think if ISIL hadn't appeared on the scene a few years ago more would have been done more would have been done as you would have liked to be done by outside powers Western powers against Assad and the Syrian government I think that would have been a game changer yes because the truth is for Syrians Isis I'm not going to say that Isis became an option but then Isis made it easier for other groups moderate Islamist groups we would call them that would I mean we're committing crimes against Syrian civilians as well such as Japan Samara Jason Mujahideen these groups who committed crimes against those opposed Assad and those the supported Assad so they became an easier option for people have to have to choose between Assad and something else because Isis was there I think that Isis's presence as I said earlier was the cause any damage it has caused damage to the Syrian opposition more than anyone so if it hadn't come into the picture then we would be in a different situation today definitely Alexei what do you think the Russian / Syrian government plan is for the non Isis non Jabbar tallness or non al-qaeda forces in Syria do you actually think that's even possible for the Syrian government in the long term to reconcile with legitimate non distortion groups as you can see Russia since it's in military involvement simultaneously started to launch this reconciliation process within Syria secondly we witnessed this launch of new negotiation track in Astana which was not an alternative to Geneva as many argue but the additional track which was aimed at settling down like more nuanced things on the ground which were made it happened when real field commanders from the ground who have actual influence were able to meet and sit together and and talk so I wouldn't put all blame for serious destruction on Russia let me already okay let me let me put the point about America to tomorrow what do you think Trump's endgame is we know we've talked about Obama's failure and say what do you think Trump's that's the million-dollar question Mehdi at a minimum I do think the Trump administration's priority has been to deal with ISIL and they have continued the Obama administration strategy and are successfully doing so the challenge will be what's next right now the US military has 2,000 personnel in Syria so going forward what's the purpose and having those 2,000 US military personnel what's actually their mandate their mission their rules of engagement my view is that a minimum it should just be clear we should not delude ourselves into thinking that they are not combatants in whatever's going on and I think the u.s. really needs to prioritize humanitarian assistance particularly for the refugees now who have really streamed across the region in a number of states that aren't terribly strong to begin with yeah and you have a US president who demonizes them all as terrorists and snakes etc Romney let me ask you this what would you what is your message to the US government today to other Western governments what would you want them to do if you could wave a magic wand and get them to do what you wanted to do what would it be a magic wand the thing is we the thing is iiiii don't want to I don't want to be offensive but I think that whatever I'm going to say is not really going to matter in that sense but I think that what's important now for a Syrian population is not just looking at the situation of Syrians that are inside Syria because a very large segment of Syrian society is no longer in Syria and I think what we need now is integration programs for Syrians abroad because I think that's where the opposition is headed it's headed abroad we're now a Syrian diaspora is being built outside the country because the situation in Syria doesn't isn't opening it's not open arms the Syrians coming back it's open arms to Syrians that are willing to keep their mouth shut and accept the fact that half of the country has been driven out and five hundred thousand people have been killed and society has been raped of all of its rights so I think that if they want to fix this situation at this stage it's to provide Syrians that have actually left the country and those that wish to leave the country a situation where they can actually live in dignity and enjoy the freedoms that everyone else would enjoy we'll have to leave it there mara Rami Alexei thank you all for joining me in the arena here or not front thank you Johann Hari is a best-selling British author who spent the last three years working on a new book about what he believes the real causes of anxiety and depression are Hari says we've been looking at depression all wrong it's not the widely prescribed antidepressants we should be focused on but our society and our culture a self proclaimed child of the Prozac age Hari says we need to spend more time in nature enjoying our work building lasting relationships these unexpected solutions will help solve anxiety and depression but just how unexpected are they and how realistic are they Johanna hari joins me now thanks for coming on upfront go through thee in your new book lost connection do you do a deep dive into anxiety and depression what made you want to even begin researching and writing a book on this subject to begin with yeah it was a bit before that I'd gone to my doctor when I was a teenager and I'd explained that had this feeling like pain was kind of bleeding out on me and I couldn't regulate it or control it I've got quite ashamed of it and my doctor told me I give you these drugs it'll boost G and I felt a tremendous amount of relief like most people who take the drugs at first then there's feeling of pain started to kind of bleed back through so I was given higher and higher doses until I was taking the maximum possible dose for thirteen years at the end of it I still felt terrible and I thought well what's happening because I'm doing everything our culture tells me to do but the more important mystery to me is why were there so many other people in our culture who are so deeply to de-stress you know one in five Americans will take a psychiatric drug in their lifetime there are far more people who are really deeply anxious and depressed - and not doing this so I ended up going on this big journey meeting scientists all over the world the leading experts on what causes depression anxiety you have to saw them I learned the World Health Organization the leading medical body in the world their position is that the chemical imbalance theory is way too simplistic that actually as they put it mental health is produced socially and any social as well as individual solutions if the w-h-o is saying then you call the consensus of the chemical imbalance deeply misleading and unscientific isn't that consensus rather medical impacts yes there is no consensus so there is no consensus if the whe are saying that then what's the problem is it not filtered down to grassroots levels to local doctors or what so there's this weird possum yeah and it's a really good question there's this weird disconnection because nobody denies that there are social and psychological causes a depression and anxiety but that has not informed most of how we respond to these problems I'll give you an example I noticed that lots of the people I know who are depressed and anxious their depression and anxiety focuses around their work just start to look at what's the evidence for how people feel about their work and the figures are quite shocking they come from Gallup the most detailed study we have 13 percent of people in our culture liked their work most of the time 63 percent of what they called sleep working so they don't like it hate it 24 percent of people hate their work that means 87 percent of people don't like the thing they're doing most of their waking lives if you go to work and you feel controlled you have low or no control you aren't much more likely to become depressed you'll also much more likely to have a stress-related heart now say our culture but there are many many non-western cultures that have always taken you know valuing other things other than material goals focusing on the community so it's not necessarily innovative or new for everyone around the world who might say you're telling us what we already know and do yeah I think that's a fair enough point I think as a culture Western culture which has become the dominant culture across the world is obviously being imposed on a lot of a lot of the world it is disconnected many people from their deeper underlying psychological needs being met this is one reason there's all this interesting research that actually mental health massively increases when people move from developing countries to developed countries right so if you're you live in Bangladesh and you moved to the United States your risk of mental health problems go up absolutely in no now part of that is the pressure of racism and those things which are very real but I think a big part of that is moving from society where deeper psychological needs are met to societies where our psychological needs are met and much less effectively and you talk about interviewing a lot of experts and doctors insiders you're not an expert or scientist or just to your side of course the journalist I'm not a scientist yeah so you're not telling me was to stop taking antidepressants qualified to say that it's bizarre that loads of people have acted like that's what I've said well Dean Burnett who's a neuroscientist at Cardiff University in the UK he says you're asserting yourself as it quote maverick expert and backing up your arguments would suspect cherry-picking of evidence he says because of your past reputation you were accused I think you admitted to plagiarizing in the past that people shouldn't people like yourself with that reputation shouldn't make quote sweeping statements about something as sensitive as mental health what do you say to him what's curious is Dean Burnett himself wrote an article less than a year ago making exactly the same point I make which is that more quoting approvingly a study which shows that more and more than half of people who take chemical antidepressants don't experience a significant relief in their depression so it would be completely right to be critical if I was coming along with some Maverick position that was outside the scientific consensus what I'm trying to do is explain the position of the World Health Organization and the leading scientist and because you come along and it up it's a best-selling book it's got you know lots of interesting people reviewing on the back but then when I'm asking about it you're saying well I'm not telling you anything new with the more write a book about it it's a really weird disconnect isn't it yeah because on the one hand this has been known by scientists for years and yeah I don't know anyone who went to their doctor and got told this stuff so I think the book is trying to come in the middle of this weird disconnect where actually scientists know this stuff perfectly well right this is not particularly controversial and yet first things not been explained to the public but I think more importantly is airing on the medical front line that's where the message is being lost when you go to your notes more it's just not been explained to the wider culture so another critic of yours carmine Perry and a psychiatrist professor at King's College London says contrary that to the claim that too many people are prescribed antidepressants he points out only one in five people with depression in high-income countries receive help psychological or pharmacological in the developing world is even less only one in 27 people who need it get help so are you looking at this problem the wrong way around yeah I think dr. Perry ante is absolutely right people are gently need help with depression and anxiety one of the people who really helped me to understand this is a wonderful South African psychiatrist I got to know called dr. Derrick summer field so not to some feel happened to be in Cambodia when chemical antidepressants were first introduced and the doctors there didn't know what these drugs were obviously so he explained to them and they said we don't need them we've already got antidepressants and he said what do you mean they told him a story there was a farmer in their community who worked in the rice fields who one day stood on a landmine left over by the American invasion of Southeast Asia had his leg blown off they gave him an artificial limb he went back to work in the fields but apparently it's super painful to work underwater with an artificial limb I imagine it was quite traumatic to be in a field where you've been blown up he starts to cry all day doesn't want to get out of bed classic depression and anxiety they said to Derrick we gave him an antidepressant he said what did you do they explained they went and sat with him they listened to his problem they understood again his pain made sense wasn't some irrational malfunction they figured if they bought him a cow he could you know would get out of this situation where he was so depressed he'd become a dairy farmer they bought him a cow and within a few weeks he stopped crying all the time as they said to him so you see doctor that cow was an antidepressant that's what you mean right now what those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively is what the World Health Organization has been trying and all these other sites have been trying to tell us for years which is if you're depressed if you're anxious you're not crazy your pain is not a malfunction it's not a pathology you're not a machine with broken apart antidepressant is it your view that they're over prescribed right now because it's not Perry enters view so I'm just wondering is that your views sure and no not particularly I mean I think there are people there are plenty of people like who were like me who were taking chemical antidepressants and they didn't help and for those people if they want to I recommend they cut back very slowly there are other people who would be helped by antidepressants who aren't taking them this isn't an argument for or against chemical antidepressants it's an argument for expanding what we think of as an antidepressant it's dealing with the reasons why people are depressed and anxious in the first place so you have 300 million people worldwide living with depression or anxiety you sound optimistic how optimistic are you what hope is there for 300 million I think part of the cruelest thing we've done is we've put the onus for solving this problem on two depressed contentious people we don't do that with other problems we don't say the problem of car crashes have to be solved by people who've already been mangled in a car accident right we have seatbelts and speed limits and airbags and we arrest duis right in a similar way what we need because this is a social crisis primarily not entirely there are real biological factors but because this is primarily a social crisis we need social solutions not least because the factors that are making some people acutely depressed and anxious are making most people in this culture less happy than they could be I think you'd struggle to find a person who could read the known causes of depression and anxiety they write back in the book and not identify with at least one of them playing out in their life now most people don't become acutely depressed thankfully but these changes are changes that will radically improve people's lives more generally even if you don't suffer from depression anxiety or different general well-being and happiness exactly and you think about what it's like to be in a culture where people are increasingly isolated they are alone they are broken up they're told that money is about spending is their story that life is about spending it's about buying and accumulating they're encouraged to spend their lives screaming each other through screens and being controlled at work and then we tell them that the pain of all that is just the result of a chemical imbalance in their brains are we surprised that depression and anxiety keep rising in those situations it doesn't have to be this way yeah one re will have to leave it there thanks for coming on upfront that's our show upfront we'll be back next week you
