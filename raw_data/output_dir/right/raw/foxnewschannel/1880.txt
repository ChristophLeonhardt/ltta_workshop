1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,359
CONFIRMATIONS FOR CIA DIRECTOR.

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:03,794
JOHN BRENNAN AND GINA HASPEL.

3
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:08,164
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:10,033
ANGLE.

5
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:14,271
LET'S TAKE A TRIP BACK TO 2013

6
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:15,639
WHEN DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,474
SUPPORTED WHAT THEY NOW OPPOSE.

8
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:19,843
ON MARCH 7 OF THAT YEAR, THE

9
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:21,078
SENATE HAD CONFIRMED OBAMA CIA

10
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:23,614
DIRECTOR NOMINEE JOHN BRENNAN.

11
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:26,450
NOW BEAR IN MIND, HE WAS

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,951
PREVIOUSLY DIRECTOR OF THE

13
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:28,852
NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER

14
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:32,289
AND REPORTEDLY A SUPPORTER OF

15
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:32,890
ENHANCED INTERROGATION.

16
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,559
13 REPUBLICANS WERE AMONG THE 63

17
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,063
SENATORS WHO VOTED TO CONFIRM

18
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:40,764
BRENNAN, INCLUDING SENATORS

19
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:43,166
LINDSEY GRAHAM AND

20
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:43,901
JOHN McCAIN.

21
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:46,069
JUST TWO DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST

22
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:48,071
THE NOMINEE, PAT LEAHY AND JEFF

23
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:49,840
MERKLEY ALONG WITH INDEPENDENT

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,874
BERNIE SANDERS.

25
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,843
NOW, THE ISSUE OF BRENNAN'S

26
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:53,510
INVOLVEMENT IN THE ENHANCED

27
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,878
INTERROGATION IN THAT WHOLE

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:56,280
PROGRAM DIDN'T CONCERN THE

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,714
DEMOCRATS ON THE SENATE INTEL

30
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:58,882
COMMITTEE BACK THEN.

31
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,485
OF THE 50 DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED TO

32
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:04,821
CONFIRM BRENNAN IN 2013, 36 ARE

33
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:07,090
STILL IN OFFICE.

34
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:07,891
DURING BRENNAN'S CONFIRMATION

35
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:09,826
HEARING IN FEBRUARY OF 2013,

36
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:12,062
WEAPONIZED DRONES WERE THE BIG

37
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:13,096
ISSUE.

38
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:13,830
THIS IS HOW THE QUESTION OF

39
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,500
WATERBOARDING WAS ADDRESSED.

40
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,502
>> WHAT STEPS DID YOU TAKE TO

41
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,470
STOP CIA FROM MOVING TO THESE

42
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,407
TECHNIQUES YOU NOW SAY YOU FOUND

43
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:24,074
OBJECTIONABLE AT THE TIME?

44
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:26,243
>> I DID NOT TAKE STEPS TO STOP

45
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:27,110
THE CIA'S USE OF THOSE

46
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,511
TECHNIQUES.

47
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,079
I WAS NOT IN THE CHAIN OF

48
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,514
COMMAND OF THAT PROGRAM.

49
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:31,715
I'VE EXPRESSED MY PERSONAL

50
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:35,185
OBJECTIONS AND USED TO AGENCY

51
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:37,487
COLLEAGUES ABOUT CERTAIN OF

52
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:38,855
THOSE EIT'S SUCH AS

53
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:40,857
WATERBOARDING, AND OTHERS WHERE

54
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:41,658
I PROFESS MY PERSONAL OBJECTIONS

55
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:43,427
TO IT BUT I DID NOT TRY TO

56
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:46,063
STOP IT BECAUSE IT WAS, YOU

57
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:47,264
KNOW, SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING

58
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,732
DONE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE

59
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,901
AGENCY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF

60
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:51,635
OTHERS.

61
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,237
AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

62
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,106
DIRECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION

63
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:56,506
AT THE TIME.

64
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:58,875
>> Laura: AND THAT WAS THAT.

65
00:01:58,875 --> 00:01:59,443
MOVE ON.

66
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:01,044
WHILE, IT WASN'T UNTIL DECEMBER

67
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:03,680
OF 2014 WHEN THE SENATE INTEL

68
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,748
COMMITTEE RELEASED A REPORT

69
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,650
SEVERELY CRITICIZING ENHANCED

70
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,851
INTERROGATION, DESCRIBING THE

71
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:10,053
TECHNIQUES AS TORTURE, WHICH

72
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:10,721
YIELDED LITTLE INTELLIGENCE.

73
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:11,588
THAT ANYONE BEGAN TO REALLY CARE

74
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:14,257
THAT MUCH ABOUT IT.

75
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:17,027
DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE AT CA

76
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,595
DIRECTOR, SP 24 SUDDENLY

77
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:19,930
REVERSED COURSE, DEFENDED THE

78
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,666
PROGRAM, AND REFUSED TO LABEL

79
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,867
TECHNIQUES LIKE

80
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:24,835
WATERBOARDING TORTURE.

81
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:27,804
EVEN THE MEDIA SEEMED A LITTLE

82
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:28,472
BIT SYNTHETIC.

83
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:30,273
NBC'S ANDREA MITCHELL, SHE

84
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:31,875
LOBBED THIS SOFT BALL AT THE CA

85
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:32,275
DIRECTOR.

86
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:35,178
>> DO YOU THINK THE BIN LADEN

87
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:40,517
CASE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED IN SOME

88
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,284
PART TO ENHANCED INTERROGATION

89
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:43,754
TECHNIQUES OR TORTURE?

90
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:46,990
>> THE DETAINEES WHO WERE

91
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,557
SUBJECTED TO ENHANCED

92
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:48,859
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES

93
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:49,559
PROVIDED INFORMATION THAT WAS

94
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:53,997
USEFUL AND WAS USED IN THE

95
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:56,800
ULTIMATE OPERATION TO GO AGAINST

96
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,667
BIN LADEN.

97
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,869
>> Laura: WELL, NOT ONLY DID

98
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:00,704
HE GO ON THE RECORD DEFENDING

99
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:02,272
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S

100
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,107
AGGRESSIVE INTERROGATION

101
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:06,276
TACTICS, HE ALSO REPORTEDLY

102
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,644
OBJECTED TO THE OBAMA

103
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,079
ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO

104
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,881
RELEASE THE BUSH INTERROGATION

105
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,649
MEMOS AND OTHER RELATED

106
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:13,483
DOCUMENTS.

107
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:14,885
APPARENTLY HE DID THINK THE

108
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:15,886
PROGRAM HAVE VALUE, WHETHER OR

109
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,921
NOT IT ACTUALLY LED TO THE

110
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,956
ELIMINATION OF BIN LADEN, WHO

111
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:22,059
KNOWS.

112
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,127
BUT REMEMBER BRENNAN WAS THAT

113
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:24,995
CA'S DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

114
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:25,662
WHEN ENHANCED INTERROGATION

115
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:28,865
TECHNIQUES WERE BEING USED.

116
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:30,300
AND HE STILL WAS CONFIRMED AS

117
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,272
CIA DIRECTOR BY DEMOCRATS.

118
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:36,039
BRENNAN WAS ALSO THE SUPERIOR TO

119
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,874
GINA HASPEL.

120
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,109
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO

121
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,245
BECOME CIA DIRECTOR.

122
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:46,550
>> WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY WAY

123
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,052
IN THE CREATION OF THE ENHANCED

124
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:49,653
INTERROGATION PROGRAM?

125
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:52,656
>> SENATOR, I WAS NOT, AND I WAS

126
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:53,390
NOT WRITING THE PROGRAM UNTIL

127
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,893
ABOUT A YEAR INTO ITS EXISTENCE.

128
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,595
>> Laura: AND GET TO LEARN

129
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,664
ABOUT THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION

130
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:01,865
AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME?

131
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:04,367
AS GINA HASPEL?

132
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,403
CONGRESS.

133
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:06,770
YES.

134
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,040
FAST FORWARD TO TODAY.

135
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,774
NANCY PELOSI AND HER FELLOW

136
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:12,375
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE A BIG

137
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,077
FUSS AND PRETEND THAT THEY HOLD

138
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,313
THE MORAL HIGH GROUND AGAINST

139
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:17,447
TORTURE?

140
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,149
WHERE WERE HER OBJECTIONS OR ANY

141
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,051
OF THEIR OBJECTIONS WHEN THEY

142
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,120
WERE BEING BRIEFED ON THESE

143
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,520
TECHNIQUES?

144
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,455
INSTEAD, DEMOCRATS AND

145
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:26,156
REPUBLICANS LIKE McCAIN AND

146
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:30,293
PAUL ARE USING HASPEL'S

147
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,662
INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAM TO

148
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:34,731
TRY TO BLOCK HER CONFIRMATION AS

149
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:35,665
CIA DIRECTOR.

150
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:36,500
BOY, WHAT A DIFFERENCE FOUR

151
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,636
YEARS MAKES.

152
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:41,538
>> MR. BRENNAN IS WITHOUT A

153
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:42,472
DOUBT QUALIFIED FOR THIS

154
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:43,573
POSITION.

155
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:46,076
PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED CLOSELY

156
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,478
WITH HIM REGULARLY CITE HIS WORK

157
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,914
ETHIC, HIS INTEGRITY, AND HIS

158
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:51,348
DETERMINATION.

159
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:53,517
JOHN BRENNAN, BY ALL ACCOUNTS,

160
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:55,285
WILL BE A STRONG LEADER.

161
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:57,154
>> WHILE MANY NOMINEES HAVE

162
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:58,088
CLASSIFIED BACKGROUNDS, YOU ARE

163
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:00,490
VERY UNIQUE.

164
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,124
WERE YOU AND ADVOCATE FOR

165
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,692
DESTROYING THE TAPES?

166
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:04,694
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF WHAT THOSE

167
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:05,662
TAPES CONTAINED?

168
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:07,664
DID YOU OVERSEE THE ENHANCED

169
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:10,800
INTERROGATION OF ALL MACHINERY

170
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,868
WHICH INCLUDED THE USE OF THE

171
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:15,672
WATERBOARDING AS PUBLICLY

172
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:16,473
REPORTED?

173
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:17,674
YES OR NO.

174
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:18,675
>> Laura: WHAT HAPPENED?

175
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:20,944
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FIRST ONE?

176
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,445
WHY DO THE DEMOCRATS WHO

177
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:25,415
SUPPORTED TO BE 24 NOW OPPOSE

178
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:26,349
GINA HASPEL?

179
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:26,783
WHAT CHANGED?

180
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:27,317
VERY CONFUSING.

181
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,686
I WILL TELL YOU WITH CHANGE.

182
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:31,755
DONALD TRUMP IS NOW PRESIDENT.

183
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:35,592
AND THE DEMOCRATS HE MUST BE

184
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:39,663
STOPPED AT ALL COSTS, AND HE BE

185
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:40,363
DENIED THE PERSONNEL TO HELP

186
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:42,866
ADVANCE HIS AGENDA.

187
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,901
IT'S NOT A TALE OF TWO

188
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,269
CONFIRMATIONS, IT'S A TALE OF

189
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:48,171
THE TWO FACES OF THE DEMOCRATIC

190
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:50,707
