“Wir sind das Volk.”
In German it means, “We are the people.”
This chant echoed through the
streets of Chemnitz, Germany,
this week, as far-right
protesters set out
to vent their frustrations, create
mayhem and attack refugees.
It was also heard in Clausnitz
in early 2016,
as a mob of Germans surrounded
a bus of refugees entering
their town.
And later that year in Bautzen,
as 80 Germans chased
some 20 teenage refugees
through the streets.
The chant has become a go-to
for the German far right.
But it wasn’t always an
extremist rallying cry.
“Leipzig is a city of
protest again tonight.”
In 1989, people in East
Germany took to the streets
to demand more
freedom, after living
under an oppressive
communist regime for decades.
Their movement was neither
of the right nor the left.
It was a cry for democracy.
After German reunification,
the chant largely disappeared.
But in recent
years, it has been
co-opted by far-right groups
who violently oppose Angela
Merkel’s open border policies.
