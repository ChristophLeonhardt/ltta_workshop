1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,401
TEACHER'S DESK.

2
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,236
THE LITERALLY WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE 

3
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,304
OF YOUR CLASS.

4
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,372
>> HE WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF YOUR 

5
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:06,673
CLASS?

6
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,607
DID YOU SEE HIM?

7
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,174
>> YES, UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T 

8
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:10,643
GET TO SEE HIM.

9
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,446
I LITERALLY RAN TO THE DOOR.

10
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,181
I LITERALLY HEARD THE SHOTS.

11
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:18,284
AND THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE 

12
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:18,718
DEAD.

13
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,887
TWO RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DOOR.

14
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:21,821
>> THREE PEOPLE DEAD OUTSIDE 

15
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,690
YOUR DOOR.

16
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,657
AND INSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL?

17
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,559
>> NO, THREE PEOPLE DEAD, I 

18
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,293
THINK IN THE SCHOOL.

19
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,463
TWO OUTSIDE MY DOOR.

20
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,333
>> TWO OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR.

21
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,335
>> LITERALLY FEET OUTSIDE MY 

22
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:35,535
DOOR.

23
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,736
FEET OUTSIDE MY DOOR.

24
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,571
>> YOU HEARD THE SHOTS.

25
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,241
ABOUT HOW MANY SHOTS DID YOU 

26
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:41,441
HEAR?

27
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,610
>> TOO MANY TO COUNT.

28
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,144
>> DID IT SOUND LIKE AUTOMATIC 

29
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:47,180
WEAPONS FIRE LIKE A MACHINE GUN?

30
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,050
>> IT SOUNDED MORE LIKE A PISTOL

31
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,185
THAN A SHOTGUN.

32
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,852
>> DID YOU HEAR ANY TALKING BY 

33
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:54,687
THE SHOOTER?

34
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,990
>> NO, I JUST HEARD SCREAMING 

35
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,192
FROM PEOPLE BEING SHOT, INJURED.

36
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:01,694
MAYBE PEOPLE DYING.

37
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,796
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

38
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:06,566
>> SO, THIS WAS, YOU SAY, RIGHT 

39
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,333
OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR.

40
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,569
WHAT DID YOU DO ONCE YOU HEARD 

41
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:10,836
THE SHOTS?

42
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:12,839
WERE YOU LOCKED INSIDE THE ROOM?

43
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,440
>> YES, THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

44
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,343
ALL THE STUDENTS GOT LOW TO THE 

45
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:17,576
GROUND.

46
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,312
WE GOT TO WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE 

47
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,014
INSIDE THE DOOR.

48
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,117
AND ALL ROUGHLY 20 STUDENTS WERE

49
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,418
SITTING UNDERNEATH THE DESK WITH

50
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,018
MY TEACHER. 

51
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:27,887
>> YOU WERE SITTING UNDERNEATH 

52
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:28,454
THE DESK.

53
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,456
WERE YOU ABLE TO BARRICADE THE 

54
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:30,690
DOOR?

55
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,759
>> NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH 

56
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,560
TIME.

57
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,761
FORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE TEACHERS

58
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,565
THAT IS VERY STRICT, STRICTLY 

59
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,700
ENFORCES THE POLICY AT MY 

60
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,036
SCHOOL, THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED TO 

61
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:45,838
KNOW WITH AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS 

62
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:46,973
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS NOW.

63
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,975
>> SO, YOU'VE HAD DRILLS FOR A 

64
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,310
SITUATION LIKE THIS IN THE PAST?

65
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,777
>> NOT ANY DRILLS BUT 

66
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:52,845
INFORMATION TOLD ON US.

67
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,381
AND ACTUALLY, RIGHT WHEN WE CAME

68
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,350
BACK FROM WINTER BREAK, SO, NOT 

69
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,553
EVEN A MONTH AGO, TELLING US 

70
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,154
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IN CASE THIS 

71
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:02,922
WOULD EVER HAPPEN.

72
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,258
>> AND IT'S NOW 3:20.

73
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,327
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT TIME THIS

74
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:07,594
HAPPENED?

75
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,229
WHAT TIME YOU HEARD THE SHOTS?

76
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,199
>> SO, AT AROUND 2:20, 2:25 IS 

77
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,500
WHEN IT STARTED.

78
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,135
AND I'D SAY IT PROBABLY ENDED 

79
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,537
AROUND 2:30.

80
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:21,774
POLICE WERE AT OUR DOOR BY 2:45.

81
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,843
>> THAT'S ABOUT 25 MINUTES RIGHT

82
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,277
THERE.

83
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,812
THIS IS STILL BEING DESCRIBED AS

84
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,081
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION.

85
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,116
HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD ANYTHING 

86
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,018
ABOUT THE SHOOTER, WHERE HE OR 

87
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:32,619
SHE MIGHT BE?

88
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,353
>> NO.

89
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,687
AND YOU'RE STILL IN THE 

90
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:34,954
CLASSROOM?

91
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,725
>> NO.

92
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,727
WE HAD POLICE INVADE THE SCHOOL.

93
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,830
AND WE WERE TAKEN OUT, 

94
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,598
BASICALLY, EVACUATED.

95
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,567
FORTUNATELY, MY FATHER WAS THERE

96
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,302
TO PICK ME UP AT THE MOMENT.

97
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,638
AND I LEFT AND EVACUATED TO MY 

98
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,905
HOUSE WHERE I'M AT CURRENTLY.

99
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,340
>> SO, YOU'RE IN YOUR HOUSE 

100
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,475
RIGHT NOW.

101
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,476
SO, YOU'RE SAFE RIGHT NOW.

102
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:56,776
>> YES.

103
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,811
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY

104
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,079
PEOPLE WERE LEFT IN THE SCHOOL 

105
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,314
WHEN YOU LEFT?

106
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,782
>> PLENTY.

107
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,017
HUNDREDS.

108
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,284
HUNDREDS.

109
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,585
MAE CLOSE TO A COUPLE 

110
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:05,852
THOUSAND.

111
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,952
>> BECAUSE THERE'S ABOUT 3,000 

112
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,321
PEOPLE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL, 

113
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:08,688
RIGHT?

114
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,323
>> YES, MAYBE EVEN MORE.

115
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,690
THERE WAS DEFINITELY -- WE WERE 

116
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,526
THE FIRST ONES OUT.

117
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,960
WE WERE THE CLOSEST TO THE 

118
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,196
PARKING LOTS.

119
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,064
>> YOU SAY THE FIRST SHOTS WERE 

120
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,967
IN THE PARKING LOT?

121
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,269
>> NO, WE'RE HERE, BUT WE'RE 

122
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,437
CLOSE TO THE PARKING LOT.

123
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,139
>> YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE PARKING 

124
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:26,305
LOT.

125
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,906
THE FIRST SHOTS, AS FAR AS YOU 

126
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,409
KNOW, WERE OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

127
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,210
YOU SAID YOU SAW TWO BODIES 

128
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,145
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF YOUR 

129
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:33,613
CLASSROOM?

130
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,415
>> YES, RIGHT AFTER WE WERE 

131
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,117
EVACUATING I SAW TWO DEAD 

132
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:38,350
BODIES.

133
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,387
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE 

134
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,156
THE SHOOTER WENT AFTER THAT?

135
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,224
>> I HEARD SHOTS COMING FROM 

136
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,392
NEXT DOOR.

137
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,294
THEN A COUPLE MORE MORE DOWN.

138
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,196
AFTER THAT, I HEARD FOOTSTEPS 

139
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,597
ABOVE US IN THE SECOND FLOOR.

140
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:52,898
AND FROM THERE, I CAN'T TELL 

141
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:53,166
YOU.

142
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,133
>> RIGHT.

143
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,069
SO, YOU SAY THE POLICE GOT THERE

144
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,269
ABOUT 25 MINUTES AFTER THE 

145
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,371
SHOOTING BEGAN.

146
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,005
CAN YOU ESTIMATE AT ALL -- YOU 

147
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,106
SAID THERE WERE TOO MANY SHOTS 

148
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,275
TO COUNT AS WELL.

149
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,609
CAN YOU ESTIMATE AT ALL HOW LONG

150
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,612
THE SHOOTING WENT ON?

151
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,348
ABOUT HOW MANY MINUTES? 

152
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,883
>> I'D SAY MAYBE CLOSE TO 3 1/2,

153
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,919
4 MINUTES FROM WHAT I COULD 

154
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,119
HEAR.

155
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,554
FROM WHERE I COULD HEAR IT.

156
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:14,887
>> RIGHT.

157
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,454
BUT THE SHOOTER WAS, AS FAR AS 

158
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,591
YOU COULD TELL, WAS ALSO MOVING?

159
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,291
>> YES.

160
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,361
>> AND HAVE YOU BEEN IN CONTACT 

161
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,729
WITH ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS FROM 

162
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,329
INSIDE THE SCHOOL?

163
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:27,667
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.

164
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,436
AS SOON AS I GOT OUT AND I SAW 

165
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,871
MY FRIENDS IT WAS ONE OF THE 

166
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,672
MOST EMOTIONAL TIMES I'VE EVER 

167
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,875
EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.

168
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,243
SEEING MY FRIENDS SAFE.

169
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,844
ON THE WAY HOME, I WAS CHECKING 

170
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,680
MY PHONE.

171
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,350
AND I JUST SEEN SO MANY MESSAGES

172
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,719
OF PEOPLE JUST TEXTING AND 

173
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:46,952
CALLING.

174
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:47,820
AS ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, 

175
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,988
PEOPLE ARE CALLING.

176
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,423
I'M PRETTY SURE A LOT OF MY 

177
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,791
FRIENDS ARE SAFE, YES.

178
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,359
>> YOU THINK MOST OF YOUR 

179
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,761
FRIENDS ARE SAFE.

180
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,662
DID YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS, YOU 

181
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,030
FOUND, YOU SAW OUTSIDE YOUR 

182
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,431
CLASSROOM, THE VICTIMS?

183
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,333
>> PARDON ME?

184
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,401
>> DID YOU KNOW THE VICTIMS 

185
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,168
OUTSIDE YOUR CLASSROOM?

186
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:06,138
>> NO, I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK.

187
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,007
>> WE'RE WATCHING, THIS IS STILL

188
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,008
A LIVE PICTURE.

189
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,076
WE'RE STILL SEEING MORE OF THE 

190
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,212
STUDENTS EVACUATED RIGHT NOW.

191
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,980
PEOPLE WALKING OUT WITH THEIR 

192
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,948
HANDS UP.

193
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,283
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR TEACHER KNEW

194
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,552
WHAT TO DO IN THE MOMENT?

195
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,119
>> YES.

196
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,454
>> AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE 

197
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,755
BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TEXT FROM 

198
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,691
ANY OF YOUR CLASSMATES OR FROM 

199
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,993
ANYBODY ELSE AT THE SCHOOL, HAVE

200
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,461
YOU PICKED UP ANY MORE 

201
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,895
INFORMATION FROM THE TEXTS FROM 

202
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,565
YOUR CLASSMATES, ANY MORE 

203
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,166
INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE 

204
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,200
INJURED OR VICTIMS? 

205
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,004
>> I GATHER, A COUPLE TEACHERS I

206
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,872
KNOW FOR SURE, ARE INJURED.

207
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,473
I GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S TWO 

208
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,009
DEAD, TWO DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

209
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,779
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT ONE OF MY 

210
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,614
CLOSE FAMILY FRIENDS' SON HAD 

211
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,749
BLOOD ALL OVER HIM.

212
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,050
I CAN'T TELL YOU HIS NAME.

213
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,852
I CAN'T THINK OF IT AT THE 

214
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,085
MOMENT.

215
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:55,121
AND AS FAR AS EVERYBODY IN MY 

216
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,389
CLASS WHO ELSE.

217
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,191
>> AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE 

218
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,592
ANSWER TO THIS, CAN YOU TELL IF 

219
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:05,031
IT WAS ONE OR MORE THAN ONE 

220
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,331
SHOOTERS?

221
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,999
>> I HONESTLY CAN'T TELL YOU 

222
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,199
THAT.

223
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,234
I HAVE NO IDEA.

224
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,801
BUT IT'S NOT -- I DON'T THINK IT

225
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,005
WAS MULTIPLE -- OR ANYTHING, A 

226
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,307
SMALL NUMBER, ONE OR TWO.

227
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,008
>> AND YOU KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER

228
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,142
CONTINUED TO GO THROUGH, YOU 

229
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,678
HEARD SHOTS FROM OTHER PARTS OF 

230
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,246
THE SCHOOL.

231
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,681
BUT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT COME INTO 

232
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,448
YOUR CLASSROOM AT ALL.

233
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,082
>> NO.

234
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,884
>> YOU NEVER SAW THE SHOOTER 

235
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,051
WALK BY YOUR CLASSROOM?

236
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,455
>> NO, I DO NOT HAVE WHAT HE 

237
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,122
LOOKED LIKE.

238
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,591
>> BECAUSE YOU WERE DOWN ON THE 

239
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:31,824
GROUND.

240
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,992
>> YES.

241
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,494
>> MICHAEL, THANKS VERY MUCH.

242
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,729
THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ALL OF 

243
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,096
US.

244
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,364
AND I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO 

245
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,734
YOUR FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES 

246
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,101
RIGHT NOW.

247
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,168
I HOPE WE CAN CALL YOU BACK IF 

248
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,603
YOU PICK UP NEW INFORMATION.

249
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:45,938
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE SAFE AND WE'RE

250
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:49,308
HOPING FOR THE BEST FOR YOUR 

251
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,111
CLASSMATES AND SCHOOL MATES.

252
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,883
I WANT TO BRING IN BRAD.

253
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,018
THOSE ARE STUDENTS BEING LET OUT

254
00:06:59,018 --> 00:06:59,919
OF THE HIGH SCHOOL.

255
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,921
WE KNOW ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE 

256
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,856
EYEWITNESSES THAT THE SHOOTING 

257
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,158

NORTHEAST OF FT. LAUDERDALE, 

259
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:11,397

00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,433
ACCORDING TO MARK KATZ ON THE 

261
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,302
SCENE, POLICE ON THE SCENE RIGHT

262
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,605

I WANT TO BRING IN BRAD GARRETT,

264
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,809
FBI SPECIAL AGENT.

265
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,012
IT DOES APPEAR, BRAD, ACCORDING 

266
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,847
TO WHAT MARK KATZ WAS TELLING 

267
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:32,318
US, THEY WERE PRETTY WELL TR

268
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,987
TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL PERHAPS 

269
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,924
PREVENTING ANY MORE SERIOUS 

270
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,191
SITUATION?

271
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,592
>> THIS IS A SERIOUS SITUATION.

272
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,694
AND YES, TRAINING DOES SAVE 

273
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,195
LIVES EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE 

274
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,596
ACTIVE DRILLS IF YOU AT LEAST 

275
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,066
LET THE KIDS, IN PARTICULAR, THE

276
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,036
FACULTY, KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO 

277
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:50,436
DO.

278
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,204
GOING BACK TO THE THREE WORDS, 

279
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,573
RUN, HIDE, FIGHT.

280
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,007
PARTICULARLY, THE FIRST TWO -- 

281
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,642
RUN AND HIDE.

282
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,342
DEFINITELY GET PEOPLE AWAY FROM 

283
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:58,177
THE SHOOTER.

284
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,712
AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR 

285
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,013
HIM TO GET TO YOU.

286
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:01,881
>> RIGHT.

287
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,786
AND IT DOES SOUND LIKE THAT WAS 

288
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,322
THAT FOLLOWED.

289
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,325
WE ARE SEEING EVACUATION 

290
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:12,625
CONTINUING.

291
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,329
WE WANT TO GO TO CECILIA VEGA.

292
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,564
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BRIEFED?

293
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,533

WE'RE TOLD THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

298
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,774

299
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,842
SITUATION AND OF COURSE, THEY 

300
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,176
EXTEND THEIR THOUGHTS AND 

301
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,078
PRAYERS TO THOSE AFFECTED.

302
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:33,746
STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS IS THE 

303
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,313
SECOND ALERT THAT THIS WHITE 

304
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,482

THEY SENT OUT A STATEMENT ABOUT

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,001
INCIDENT COMES AS THE WHITE

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,217
HEADING TOWARDS THE HIGH SCHOOL.

323
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:16,955
VICTOR, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 

324
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:17,422

AND THEY'RE CALLING IT RIGHT NOW

329
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,832
A MASS CASUALTY INCIDENT.

330
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,933
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20 AND 50 WITH

331
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,935
THESE INCIDENTS.

332
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,169
THE NUMBERS CAN ALWAYS CHANGE 

333
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,706
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE NUMBERS 

334
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,907
TEND TO GROW HERE.

335
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,809

343
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,156
I'M NOT SURE.

344
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,757
AS FAR AS FATALITIES, NO 

345
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,492

THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONFIRMED

RIGHT NOW BUT THEY ARE DEALING 

350
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,000
WITH SEVERAL PATIENTS.

351
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,267
20 TO 50 PATIENTS RIGHT NOW IS 

352
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,303
THE NUMBER THAT I'M GETTING ON 

353
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,971

BUT I'M STILL HEADING, I'M 

355
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,741
MAKING MY WAY UP THERE.

00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,243
>> WE'LL LET YOU GET THERE.

357
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,711
AT THE SCENE, WE SEE PEOPLE

BEING TREATED.

359
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,414
WE SEE SOME OF THE VICTIMS 

360
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,349
THERE, STRETCHERS.

361
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,917
ACCORDING TO MICHAEL KATZ WHO 

362
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,319
WAS IN THE SCHOOL WHEN THE 

363
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,120

00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,625
I WANT TO GO TO OUR SENIOR

00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,160
FEDERAL RESPONSE ALREADY?

370
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,464
>> GEORGE, WE HAVE FBI AGENTS ON

371
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,298
THE WAY TO THE SCENE.

372
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,566
THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW 

373
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:35,534
POTENTIALLY BAD THE SITUATION 

374
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,235
IS.

375
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,237
WE CAN SEE FROM THE MASSIVE 

376
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,538
POLICE PRESENCE OUTSIDE THAT 

377
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,306
SCHOOL THAT THERE'S CONCERN THAT

378
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,508
THE SHOOTER IS STILL AT LARGE.

379
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,243
AND I THINK THAT'S THE THING 

380
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,978
THAT HAS LAW ENFORCEMENT 

381
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,979
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED RIGHT 

382
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,781
NOW, THAT THIS IS NOT A 

383
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,182
CONTAINED EVENT.

384
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,052
WE EXPECT THAT THE FBI WILL WORK

385
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,187
CLOSELY WITH THE BROWARD 

386
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,088
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO GET A 

387
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,723
HANDLE ON THE SITUATION.

388
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,893
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE YOU DON'T 

389
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,828
KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER IS 

390
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,095
CONTAINED.

391
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,162
WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE HOW MANY 

392
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,397
PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF 

393
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:06,232
THIS INCIDENT.

394
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,933
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THE 

395
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,235
PERIMETER, AS YOU SEE THEM 

396
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,803
DOING, AND GET THOSE KIDS 

397
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,803
OUTSIDE OF THAT SCHOOL.

398
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:12,605
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

399
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,274
WHAT WE SEE THERE, THOSE ARMORED

400
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:15,541
VEHICLES.

401
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,777
WE SAW S.W.A.T. TEAMS EARLIER GO

402
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,010
IN.

403
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,411
BRAD GARRETT, ACCORDING TO 

404
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,513
MICHAEL KATZ, THE ONE WITNESS 

405
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,482
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO SO 

406
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,883
FAR, THE SHOOTING WENT ON FOR A 

407
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,685
FEW MINUTES BUT THIS IS BEING 

408
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,721
DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

409
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,021
SITUATION.

410
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,589
TRY AND TELL US WHAT THE 

411
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,857
S.W.A.T. TEAMS ARE DOING IF THEY

412
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,424
ENTER THE SCHOOL?

413
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:35,694
>> WELL, ONE OF THE KEYS, 

414
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,030
GEORGE, JUST LIKE THE KID YOU 

415
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,764
INTERVIEWED, WHO HAS INFORMATION

416
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,065
ABOUT THE SHOOTER AND WHERE HE 

417
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,934
WAS AND WHERE HE WAS MOVING.

418
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,235
BECAUSE WHAT I SEE ON 

419
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,670
TELEVISION, THEY TEND TO BE 

420
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,371
FOCUSED ON ONE PART OF THE HIGH 

421
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,707
SCHOOL WHICH IS PROBABLY WHERE 

422
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,578
THE SHOOTER COMMITTED THIS ACT.

423
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,180
SO, THE KEY IS GOING TO BE WITH 

424
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,750
WHAT WE HAVE, WITH CAMERAS AND 

425
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,185
CCTV ARE IN PLACE THAT THEY CAN 

426
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:01,987
REVIEW AS THEY MOVE FORWARD.

427
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:02,921
IT'S INTERESTING TO WATCH THE 

428
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,223
S.W.A.T. TEAM MOVE AROUND.

429
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,058
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY IN A HUGE 

430
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,492
HURRY.

431
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,326
SO, I DON'T WANT TO READ TOO 

432
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:09,594
MUCH INTO THAT, GEORGE, BECAUSE 

433
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:12,198
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE SHOOTER'S

434
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:12,398
DOWN.

435
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,466
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE CLEARING THE 

436
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:14,733
BUILDING.

437
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,368
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

438
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,003
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST 

439
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,505
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ARE FIVE 

440
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:28,314
MINUTES OR LESS.

441
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,548
EVEN SANDY WAS LESS.

442
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,017
>> MICHAEL KATZ THOUGHT IT WENT 

443
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,452
ON FOUR TO SIX MINUTES.

444
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,820
BRAD, THANKS SO MUCH.

445
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:43,729
>> I WANT TO GO TO OUR FI AFFILE

446
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,296
WPRG.

447
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,264
THEY'RE SPEAKING THERE.

448
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,165
>> THE FAMILY KEEPS TEXTING HER,

449
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:50,369
AND SHE'S TEXTING BACK, THANK 

450
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:50,535
GOD.

451
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:51,369
>> ARE YOU RELIEVED?

452
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,538
>> I'LL BE RELIEVED WHEN SHE 

453
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,374
COMES OUT AND I CAN GIVE HER A 

454
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:55,574
HUG.

455
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,275
>> ARE YOU RELATED?

456
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,144
>> NO, JUST MET.

457
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,212
>> Reporter: AND DO YOU HAVE A 

458
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,182
SON OR DAUGHTER?

459
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,950
>> NINTH GRADE DAUGHTER.

460
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,651
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE 

461
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:07,553
TO CONTACT HER?

462
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,588
>> YES, SHE'S OKAY.

463
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,457
>> Reporter: SHE'S LOCKED IN THE

464
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,157
AUDITORIUM AS WELL?

465
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:12,825
>> YES.

466
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,560
WE KEEP PRAYING.

467
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,460
>> Reporter: DO YOU HAVE 

468
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,995
SOMEBODY?

469
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,096
>> YEAH, SHE'S TEXTING ME RIGHT 

470
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,933
NOW, SHE KEEPS TELLING ME STAY 

471
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,133
AWAY.

472
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,935
WE'RE SAFE MOM, YOU STAY AWAY.

473
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,170
I'M TELLING HER, NO, CRYSTAL, 

474
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,039
I'M YOUR MOTHER, I'M NOT STAYING

475
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,239
AWAY.

476
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,240
>> Reporter: HOW DID YOU GET 

477
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,376
WORD OF WHAT'S GOING ON OUT 

478
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:30,576
HERE?

479
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,812
>> I WAS ACTUALLY AT THE NAIL 

480
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,715
SALON, I SAW IT BREAK THROUGH ON

481
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:44,356
TV, IT SAID STONEMAN DOUGLAS 

482
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,725
HIGH SCHOOL.

483
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,193
MY HUSBAND SAID MAYBE YOU SHOULD

484
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:48,861
GO SEE.

485
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,363
>> Reporter: WERE YOU THERE 

486
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,132
RICHT AWAY OR DID IT TAKE TIME?

487
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,167
>> SHE TEXTED ME PRETTY CLOSE TO

488
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,734
WHEN IT STARTED HAPPENING.

489
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,504
SHE SAID SHE'S SCARED.

490
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,606
SHE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.

491
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,742
SHE SAID, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO 

492
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,177
SCHOOL TOMORROW, MOM.

493
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,179
I SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

494
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,447
>> Reporter: DID SHE TELL YOU IF

495
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,249
ANYBODY WAS INJURED?

496
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,286
>> NO, SHE'S JUST SAYING SHE'S 

497
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:14,553

498
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:20,892
AND I SAID LIST TON EN TO WHAT

00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:22,261
TEACHERS TELL YOU TO DO.

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,266
SHE SAID NO, THEY'RE TELLING US 

502
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,067

THIS SCENE BECOMING ALL TOO 

534
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,583
FAMILIAR IN AMERICA?

535
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,119
>> IT REALLY IS, GEORGE.

STUDENTS INSIDE, LET'S LISTEN.

559
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,926
>> I'M FROM NEW YORK AND I COME 

560
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:01,593
HERE OFTEN.

561
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,529
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU TALKED TO 

562
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,128
THE PARENTS?

563
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,163
ARE THEY HERE AS WELL?

564
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,533
>> YEAH, THE MOTHER IS HERE WITH

565
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,066
ME, MY DAUGHTER.

566
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,935
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS ARE TRYING

567
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,236
TO GET SOME INFORMATION.

568
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,305
>> WE'RE TRYING TO GET 

569
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,006
INFORMATION.

570
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,208
WE CAN'T GET AHOLD OF HER.

571
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,611
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU CALLED AND

572
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,080
NOTHING HAS COME BACK.

573
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,549
>> WE HEARD HER GIRLFRIEND GOT 

574
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:23,849
SHOT.

575
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:24,749
SHE'S VERY NERVOUS.

576
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:25,650
>> Reporter: SHE'S A SENIOR AT 

577
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,485
THE SCHOOL HERE?

578
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,286
>> YEAH, SHE'S A SENIOR AT THE 

579
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,054
SCHOOL HERE.

580
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,622
>> Reporter: I SEE THEM ASKING 

581
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,023
THE PARENTS TO MAKE THEIR WAY 

582
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:32,825
OUT TO THE PARK.

583
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,226
THEY WANT TO CLEAR THE AREA.

584
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,061
>> THAT'S WHAT MY DAUGHTER SAID,

585
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,296
THEY WANT TO CLEAR THE AREA.

586
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,530
>> Reporter: LORI, THAT'S KIND 

587
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,899
OF THE STORY, AFTER STORY, THAT 

588
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,267
WE'RE SEEING OUT HERE.

589
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,769
A LOT OF PARENTS HAVE VERY 

590
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,137
LITTLE INFORMATION ON HOW THEIR 

591
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,171
KIDS ARE DOING.

592
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,773
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY DON'T 

593
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,575
KNOW JUST YET WHEN THE 

594
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:51,343
STUDENTS -- 

595
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,580
>> MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH

596
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:54,980
SCHOOL.

597
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,315
THE SCENE OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

598
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:58,783
SITUATION, STARTED UNFOLDING 

599
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:00,219
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

600
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,453
WE KNOW OF SEVERAL INJURED.

601
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,921
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, THE 

602
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,656
INFORMATION COMING IN RIGHT NOW 

603
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,325
IS STILL SKETCHY.

604
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,759
ACCORDING TO ONE EYEWITNESS, TWO

605
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,560
DEAD ON THE SCENE.

606
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,929
AGAIN THAT HAS NOT BEEN 

607
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,564
CONFIRMED BY OTHERS RIGHT NOW.

608
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,532
I WANT TO GO BACK TO BRAD 

609
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:14,766
GARRETT.

610
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,335
AS WE CATCH THOSE POLICE OUTSIDE

611
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,935
THE HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT THERE, 

612
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,037
BRAD, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE 

613
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,372
BEEN SEEING FOR THE LAST HALF 

614
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,440
HOUR OR SO, PERIODICALLY, A 

615
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,343
BURST OF STUDENTS LEAVING THE 

616
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:24,576
SCHOOL.

617
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,109
NOW, WE'RE ALSO SEEING SOME OF 

618
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,846
THE INJURED BEING TREATED 

619
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,614
OUTSIDE.

620
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,849
MASSIVE POLICE PRESENCE.

621
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,651
WE KNOW S.W.A.T. TEAMS ARE 

622
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,752
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

623
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,020
>> THEY CERTAINLY ARE, GEORGE.

624
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,155
AND AS THEY GET CLOSER TO THE 

625
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,858
SHOOTER EVEN IF THEY THINK HE'S 

626
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,593
DECEASED OR NOT, THIS IS GOING 

627
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,263
TO BE SORT OF A METHODICAL MOVE.

628
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,931
ROOM TO ROOM TO ROOM.

629
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,666
THEY'RE GOING TO ENTER THE ROOM 

630
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,902
LIKE THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER.

631
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,703
CLEAR IT AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

632
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:51,903
ROOM.

633
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,339
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS SO BIG.

634
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,308
AND IT APPEARS TO COVER SEVERAL 

635
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,211
ACRES, I THINK YOU'VE SEEN FOR A

636
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,545
NUMBER OF KIDS LEAVING THE 

637
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:01,513
SCHOOL PROBABLY IN THE SECTION 

638
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,747
OF THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY THINK 

639
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,316
THE SHOOTER IS NOT.

640
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,485
AND SO, I SUSPECT THAT'S GOING 

641
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,055
TO GO ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

642
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,492
BUT EXPECT THIS TO GO ON FOR A 

643
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,259
WHILE.

644
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,960
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT 

645
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,095
TRANSPIRED IN THAT SCHOOL.

646
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,664
AND WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE 

647
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,031
SHOOTER.

648
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,799
>> THE ONE EYEWITNESS WE WERE 

649
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,202
ABLE TO SPEAK WITH, MICHAEL 

650
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,303
KATZ, SAID THAT THERE WERE TOO 

651
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,503
MANY SHOTS TO COUNT OVER A 

652
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:28,240
PERIOD OF FOUR TO SIX MINUTES 

653
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,874
BUT IT DID NOT SOUND LIKE A 

654
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,743
MACHINE GUN, LIKE AN AUTOMATIC 

655
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:31,976
WEAPON.

656
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:32,945
>> RIGHT.

657
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,212
AND VIRTUALLY, GEORGE, WITH THE 

658
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,882
EXCEPTION OF OUR CONVERSATIONS 

659
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,217
AT LAS VEGAS, MOST OF THESE 

660
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:43,388
SHOOTERS UNLIKE THAT GENTLEMAN 

661
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,792
STEPHEN PADDOCK, TEND TO USE 

662
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,027
SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS OR IN 

663
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,297
ADAM LANZA'S CASE IN SANDY HOOK,

664
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,601
HE USED AN AK-15 TYPE WEAPON 

665
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,503
THAT SHOOTS ROUNDS BUT NOT 

666
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,105
AUTOMATIC.

667
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,140
EVEN SHOOTING A MACHINE GUN WITH

668
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,376
A MAGAZINE, YOU CAN EMPTY THAT 

669
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,645
MAGAZINE IN PROBABLY FOUR TO SIX

670
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:06,878
SECONDS.

671
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,747
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MAGAZINES 

672
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,182
THINK OF HOW MANY ROUNDS YOU CAN

673
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,717
GET OFF IN FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES.

674
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,653
>> WE HAVE REPORTS OF PEOPLE 

675
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:14,886
INJURED.

676
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,288
THAT IS ONE OF THE STUDENTS.

677
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,489
>> MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS.

678
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:19,524
>> Reporter: WHERE WERE YOU WHEN

679
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,692
THE SHOTS RANG OUT?

680
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,394
>> I WAS BY THE HIGHWAY OVER 

681
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:22,861
THERE.

682
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,129
>> Reporter: ON THAT SIDE?

683
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:24,896
>> YEAH.

684
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,164
>> Reporter: AND YOU KNEW 

685
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,432
IMMEDIATELY WHAT WAS GOING ON?

686
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,367
>> YEAH, NO DOUBT.

687
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,802
I HEARD IT AND I RAN.

688
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,105
>> Reporter: ARE YOU ABLE TO GET

00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,706
AHOLD OF YOUR CLASSMATES YOUR 

690
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:34,973
FRIENDS? 

691
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,708
>> MY SISTER'S STILL IN THERE.

692
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,443
SHE'S TEXTING ME.

693
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,279
SHE SAID BE QUIET.

694
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,813
>> Reporter: I KNOW ONE GUY GOT 

695
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,048
SHOT IN THE LEG.

696
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,916
I HEARD MY TEACHER GOT SHOT.

697
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,617
MY NINTH GRADE TEACHER, THAT'S 

698
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:47,452
ALL I KNOW.

699
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,554
>> Reporter: ONCE AGAIN, YOU 

700
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,355

701
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,157
>> I WAS OVER THERE.

702
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,558

704
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,627
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU?

RIGHT NOW, WE NEED HELP ASAP.

707
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,833
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

708
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,600

719
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:17,182
ANYTHING.

THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.

>> I'M AT HOME RIGHT NOW WHAT 

728
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,935
HAPPENED TO ME LOOKING AT SUN 

729
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,237
SPOTS ON THE SUN MY TEACHER WAS 

730
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,006
SHOWING US.

731
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,108
AND HE SAID WE CAN GO BACK 

732
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:43,341
INSIDE.

733
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:45,344
AND THEN THERE WAS A FIRE ALARM.

734
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,446
WE ALREADY HAD A DRILL IN THE 

735
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,946
MORNING, NONETHELESS, I WENT AND

736
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:50,949
GOT MY BOOKS AND THEN IT 

737
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:51,483
STOPPED.

738
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,185
THEN I WAS CONFUSED.

739
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:57,889
ONE OUR PRINCIPALS CAME ON THE 

740
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,191
INTERCOM, SAID PLEASE EVACUATE 

741
00:20:59,191 --> 00:20:59,624
THE BUILDING.

742
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,093
I THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE.

743
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,395
WE WERE ALL WALKING OUT, NOT 

744
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:03,662
RUNNING.

745
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,496
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD 

746
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,632
TWO POPS, THAT WAS WHEN I KIND 

747
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,000
OF UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS 

748
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,267
HAPPENING.

749
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,104
ME AND MY FRIENDS -- I MET UP 

750
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,072
WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS WE WERE 

751
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,840
JUST RUNNING FOR OUR LIVES.

752
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,109
AT WIN POINT, WE STOPPED AND A 

753
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,779
SECURITY GUARD TOLD US TO KEEP 

754
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,413
RUNNING, GO.

755
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,081
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THIS WAS LIKE

756
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,349
A REAL SHOOTING THING.

757
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,951
>> ABOUT WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

758
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,819
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET 

759
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,454
OUT OF THE SCHOOL?

760
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,322
>> I HAD TO RUN ALL THE WAY TO 

761
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,557
THE WALMART.

762
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,259
THAT'S NEAR OUR SCHOOL.

763
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,962
THAT TOOK ME LIKE A TOTAL OF TEN

764
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,663
MINUTES TO GET THERE.

765
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:39,330
ACTUALLY GETTING OUTSIDE OF THE 

766
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,266
SCHOOL, IT'S A BIG SCHOOL, 

767
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,066
PROBABLY TOOK ME ABOUT FIVE 

768
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:42,834
MINUTES RUNNING.

PERSONALLY TWO POPS? 

771
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,071
>> YES.

772
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,072

I WASN'T ABLE TO GAUGE IT.

775
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,245

00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:16,975
WHICH IS CHILLING.

929
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,677
THEY POSTED POLICE ARE WORKING 

930
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,944
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SCENE AND 

931
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:22,547
ASKED IF YOU ARE IN TOUCH WITH 

932
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,382
YOUR STUDENT YOU ASK THAT THEY 

933
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,918
REMAIN CALM AND BARRICADED UNTIL

934
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,119
POLICE COME TO THE ROOM.

935
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,988
THIS IS FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY.

936
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,423
DO NOT CALL 911 OR EMERGENCY 

937
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,225
NUMBER UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

938
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,860
IMAGINE WHAT PARENTS ARE 

939
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,063
THINKING WHEN THEY GET THAT 

940
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,164
MESSAGE.

941
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,165
THAT EYEWITNESS YOU JUST SPOKE 

942
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,434
TO, THE STUDENT IN HIGH SCHOOL, 

943
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,302
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING 

944
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:44,468
ON.

945
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:46,003
>> IT'S A STORY ALL TOO FAMILIAR

946
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:47,338
RIGHT NOW.

947
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,774
I WANT TO GO TO STEVE GOMEZ, 

948
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:54,312
ALSO A FORMER FBI AGENT JOINING 

949
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,847
US AS WELL.

950
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:56,814
DESCRIBING IT AS AN ACTIVE 

951
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:57,849
SHOOTER SITUATION.

952
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,017
THEY BELIEVE THE SHOOTER WAS IN 

953
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:02,887
ONE OF THE TEN BUILDINGS OF THE 

954
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,321
FRESHMEN HIGH SCHOOL.

955
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,257
WALK US THROUGH THE PROCEDURES 

956
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,792
THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH THIS 

957
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,325
ACTIVE SHOOTER.

958
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:10,428
>> WELL, THE FIRST THING THEY 

959
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,730
WANT GO IS GET AS MANY AS THE 

960
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,665
STUDENTS OR FACULTY OUT OF THE 

961
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:15,567
AREA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

962
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,568
YOU DON'T WANT ANY MORE 

963
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:17,835
INJURIES.

964
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:21,172
THEY'RE CONTAINING THE 

965
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:21,439
SITUATION.

966
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,707
WE ALREADY SAW, I THINK AT LEAST

967
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:23,808
ONE S.W.A.T. TEAM GO IN THERE.

968
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,043
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO IMMEDIATELY

969
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:27,111
MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT SHOOTER 

970
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,046
OR SHOOTERS BECAUSE THERE'S A 

971
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,715
POSSIBILITY THAT STUDENTS OR 

972
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,084
FACULTY MAY BE HOSTAGE AND THEIR

973
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,520
LIVES MAY BE IN PERIL.

974
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,888
>> WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT THIS 

975
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:41,793
IS GOING TON FOR AN HOUR AND 20 

976
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,761
MINUTES TELL US?

977
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,330
>> IT INDICATES THAT THE SHOOTER

978
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,197
IS HOLED UP.

979
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,065
IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE THIS IS 

980
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:48,833
A VERY LARGE CAMPUS.

981
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,068
AND NOT KNOWING THE WEAPONRY 

982
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,003
THAT THE SHOOTER HAS, THERE'S 

983
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,404
ALWAYS A CONCERN THAT THE 

984
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:54,339
SHOOTER COULD BE SHOOTING 

985
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,307
OUTSIDE OF WINDOWS THAT HE'S 

986
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,242
TRYING TO SNIPER PEOPLE.

987
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,943
THEY'RE HAVING TO CONTAIN THE 

988
00:27:58,943 --> 00:27:59,210
SITUATION.

989
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,980
AND A VERY LARGE LASITUATION 

990
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,081
BUILDING AND THEY'RE TRYING TO 

991
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:07,252
PREVENT ANY MORE LOSS OF LIVES 

992
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,019
OR INJURY.

993
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,020
THAT'S PART OF THE DIFFICULTY 

994
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,288
THEY HAVE WITH THE STUDENTS 

995
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,022
MOVING OUT.

996
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,456
>> WE'RE ALSO SEEING FIRST 

997
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:15,794
RESPONDERS ON THE SCENE TREAT 

998
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,528
SOMETHING OF THE JINJURED.

999
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,195
ALSO THE POLICE GOING THROUGH 

1000
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,931
THE PILES OF BAGS OUTSIDE OF 

1001
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:20,164
SCHOOL.

1002
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:21,866
WHAT ASK YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?

1003
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,401
>> WELL, THAT'S CLEARLY A 

1004
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,502
CONCERN THAT THERE COULD BE 

1005
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,504
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, PIPE BOMBS 

1006
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,605
AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

1007
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,807
THE QUESTION IS, HAS THERE BEEN 

1008
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,843
SOME TYPE OF EXPLOSION ALREADY 

1009
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,012
WHICH IS CAUSING THAT CONCERN?

1010
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:34,946
WE'VE SEEN THAT SITUATION 

1011
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,480
HAPPENS MANY TIMES WHERE 

1012
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,616
SOMEBODY TRIES TO BUILD A PIPE 

1013
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,552
BOMB, SOMETIMES THEY DO, 

1014
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,152
SOMETIMES, THEY DON'T.

1015
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,319
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU 

1016
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,122
BRING THAT UP, THE FIRST 

1017
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:46,991
EYEWITNESS THAT WE SPOKE TO 

1018
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,192
MICHAEL KATZ SAID THE FIRST 

1019
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:50,328
COUPLE MINUTES OF SHOOTING BUT 

1020
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,264
ALSO SOMETHING SOUNDED LIKE A 

1021
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,732
GARBAGE TRUCK BACK FIRING OR 

1022
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,200
CRASHING?  

1023
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,835
>> AND THAT COULD POTENTIALLY 

1024
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,469
BEEN THE START OF THE SITUATION 

1025
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,471
WHERE THE SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS 

1026
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:02,907
MAY HAVE DECIDED LET'S START 

1027
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,310
WITH A PIPE BOMB BLAST.

1028
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,178
AND AS STUDENTS ARE RUNNING 

1029
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:07,979
AWAY, THEY START.

1030
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,848
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, THEY CREATE

1031
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,015
A DIVERSION AND THEY SHOOT AT 

1032
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,217
PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND.

1033
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,484
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

1034
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:15,019
THAT'S THE TRAGEDY.

1035
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,454
>> YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T BEEN 

1036
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,622
GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION 

1037
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,723
FROM INSIDE THE SCHOOL FROM 

1038
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,257
POLICE OR OTHERS ON THE SCENE.

1039
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:22,093
DOES THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T 

1040
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,661
HEARD ABOUT HOSTAGES FROM THE 

1041
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,063
POLICE OR ANY KIND OF 

1042
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,598
NEGOTIATION, WHAT DOES THAT TELL

1043
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:26,998
YOU?

1044
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,500
AND IS IT ANY KIND OF REAL 

1045
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,635
CONFIRMATION THAT IT HASN'T 

1046
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,069
HAPPENED?

1047
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,538
>> WELL, WHAT IT INDICATES 

1048
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,939
POTENTIALLY IS THAT THE POLICE 

1049
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,873
HAVE NOT YET HAD CONTACT WITH 

1050
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:36,607
THE SHOOTER.

1051
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,576
THEY MAY HAVE THE SHOOTER 

1052
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:38,843
CONTAINED.

1053
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,177
BUT THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY KNOW 

1054
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:41,713
WHERE THAT SHOOTER IS.

1055
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,848
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE 

1056
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,050
SHOOTER, YOU KNOW, FINISHED WHAT

1057
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,820
THE SHOOTER WAS INTENDING TO DO.

1058
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,288
AND IS NOW WAITING FOR THE 

1059
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,189
POLICE TO COME IN.

1060
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,792
EITHER TAKE THEM HOSTAGE OR DIE 

1061
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,494
BY COP OR COMMIT SUICIDE.

1062
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,629
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT 

1063
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:00,198
THINGS THAT THESE TYPE OF ACTIVE

1064
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,699
SHOOTERS HAVE DONE IN THESE 

1065
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,800
TYPES OF SITUATIONS.

1066
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,135
THE POLICE ARE CONSIDERING ALL 

1067
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,169
OF THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AS 

1068
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,337
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR APPROACH.

1069
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,239
>> AS YOU MENTIONED, STEVE, A 

1070
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:08,906
LARGE CAMPUS.

1071
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:11,109
TEN BUILDINGS.

1072
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,176
WE'RE STILL SEEING STUDENTS 

1073
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:16,280
BEING ESCORTED OUT WITH HANDS 

1074
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,447
UP.

1075
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,284
YOU SEE POLICE OUT THERE 

1076
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:19,551
OUTSIDE.

1077
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,218
ONE GUN TRAINED FOR A SECOND UP 

1078
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:25,189
TOAST SECOND FLOOR.

1079
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:26,056
MARTHA RADDATZ IN WASHINGTON.

1080
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:27,791
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD WITH 

1081
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,095
THE TRAINING OF STUDENTS AND 

1082
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,096
TEACHERS KICKED IN?

1083
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,198
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE, EVERY SCHOOL

1084
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:36,367
IN THE COUNTRY, EVERY TEACHER, 

1085
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,069
EVERY STUDENT HAS HAD SOME KIND 

1086
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,804
OF TRAINING ON WHAT YOU DO IF 

1087
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,172
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.

1088
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,307
THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO.

1089
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,441
THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1090
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,709
THEY KNOW TO TAKE COVER.

1091
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,144
THE PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING LIKE 

1092
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,447
THIS, IT IS NEVER OUT OF A BOOK.

1093
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,581
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT 

1094
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:51,149
WILL BE DIFFERENT.

1095
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,017
BUT THAT TRAINING HOPEFULLY 

1096
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,719
KICKED IN WITH THESE STUDENTS.

1097
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:59,056
YOU SAW SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS 

1098
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:00,391
RUNNING OUT AND SURELY INTO A 

1099
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,026
PART OF THE BUILDING WHERE THE 

1100
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,661
SHOOTER WAS NOT.

1101
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,929
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THOSE 

1102
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,330
BUILDINGS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY 

1103
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,565
HAVE TRAINED TO DO.

1104
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,567
>> AND WE'RE STILL SEEING LIVE 

1105
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:10,834
PICTURES.

1106
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:13,504
RIGHT NOW, YOU SEE MORE STUDENTS

1107
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,539
BEING ESCORTED OUT.

1108
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,307
WHAT IS SAY VERY LARGE CAMPUS IN

1109
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,009
SOUTH FLORIDA.

1110
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,076
TEN BUILDINGS, ACCORDING TO ONE 

1111
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,811
OF THE BUILDING.

1112
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:23,715
TOM LLAMAS, WE'VE SEEN A MASSIVE

1113
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,918
RESPONSE, AND THE GOVERNOR OF 

1114
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,587
FLORIDA RICK SCOTT NOW HEADING 

1115
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:29,820
THERE?

1116
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,888
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HAVE 

1117
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,824
MULTIPLE AGENCIES ON THE GROUND 

1118
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,124
RESPONDING.

1119
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,925
WE'RE TALKING 3,000 KIDS IN ONE 

1120
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:37,294
OF THE SCHOOLS AND 1500 OTHER 

1121
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:40,798
KIDS IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL NEXT 

1122
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:40,998
DOOR.

1123
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:43,100
4500 STUDENTS POTENTIALLY ALL 

1124
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,236
COMING OUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES.

1125
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,138
THIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE 

1126
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:47,405
SITUATION.

1127
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,474
WE HAVE BEEN TOLDING THAT 

1128
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,943
BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE 

1129
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,378
IS STAGING AN AREA FOR A 

1130
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:53,845
BRIEFING.

1131
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,213
THAT IS PRELIMINARY.

1132
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,881
GEORGE, TO THAT POINT EARLIER, 

1133
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,282
WE'VE NOT BEEN BRIEFED WHICH 

1134
00:31:58,282 --> 00:31:59,517
MEANS THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR 

1135
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,619
THE SHOOTER AND SO MUCH UNKNOWN.

1136
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,020
>> WE'RE GETTING A PICTURE FROM 

1137
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:08,192
ONE OF THE STUDENTS INSIDE.

1138
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,726
AJ 2200.

1139
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,596
STILL LOCKED IN.

1140
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:16,834
CHECKED THE LOCAL NEWS, 20 

1141
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,037
VICTIMS.

1142
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:26,978
LONG LIVE MARJORY STONEMAN 

1143
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:33,250
DOU

1144
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,385
DOUGLAS.

1145
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,019
THOMAS LLAMAS, CALM AND RUNNING 

1146
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,552
OUT BUT SOME STILL INSIDE.

1147
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:36,186
>> AND THE AGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, 

1148
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:41,959
WE JUST READ THAT TWEET FROM THE

1149
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,560
POLICE DEPARTMENT WHICH TOLD 

1150
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,127
STUDENTS STAY BARRICADED.

1151
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,129
EVEN TELLING PARENTS NOT TO CALL

1152
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:45,295
911.

1153
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:47,198
NOT TO GO TO THE SCHOOL.

1154
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,466
THEY'RE WAITING TO GET THE KIDS 

1155
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:48,699
OUT.

1156
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,468
WE SEE FIRE DEPARTMENT TREATING 

1157
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,003
SOME CHILDREN RIGHT THERE ON THE

1158
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,471
SCENE, THE SIDEWALK.

1159
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,539
LOOKS LIKE -- YEAH, FIRE 

1160
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:56,807
DEPARTMENT AND PARAMEDICS BOTH 

1161
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,342
ON THE SCENE RIGHT THERE.

1162
00:32:58,342 --> 00:32:59,110
IT'S HARD TO READ.

1163
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,712
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PARKLAND FIRE

1164
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:02,346
DEPARTMENT.

1165
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:03,247
MASSIVE SCENE.

1166
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,748
SEVERAL AGENCIES STILL 

1167
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:07,318
RESPONDING AND ACTIVE ON THE 

1168
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:07,919
HOUR.

1169
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,022
>> JOINED ON THE PHONE BY THE 

1170
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:13,925
CHIEF OF BROWARD.

1171
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,494
WE SAW THIS LOCALLY FROM LAW 

1172
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,762
ENFORCEMENT AND STUDENTS HAVE 

1173
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,530
BEEN TRAINED.

1174
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,199
EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY 

1175
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,933
NOW HAS EMERGENCY TRAINING FOR 

1176
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:25,569
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE 

1177
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:28,339
BECOME ALL TOO PREVALENT IN OUR 

1178
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:28,572
COUNTRY?

1179
00:33:28,572 --> 00:33:29,707
>> YES, GEORGE.

1180
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,876
THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE 

1181
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,211
SHELTERING IN PLACE.

1182
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,079
LET'S BE REMINDED THAT MANY 

1183
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,181
STATES PASSED LAWS THAT ARMED 

1184
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,715
SOME OF THEIR TEACHERS.

1185
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:41,052
AND WE NEED TO BE AWARE AS WE'RE

1186
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,587
RESPONDING TO THIS WHO MIGHT BE 

1187
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,255
THE ACTIVE SHOOTER AND WHO MIGHT

1188
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,458
BE A CONCEALED CARRIER.

1189
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,593
SO THIS IS A VERY TENSE TIME TO 

1190
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,329
TRY TO IDENTIFY AND REALLY 

1191
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:54,298
LOCATE AND HOPEFULLY, PIN DOWN 

1192
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,001
THIS ACTIVE SHOOTER SO THAT WE 

1193
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:00,304
CAN MAKE THESE STUDENTS SAFE.

1194
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,139
CHIEF, WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY 

1195
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:02,940
REPORTS WITH ANY CONTACT WITH 

1196
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,476
THE SHOOTER OF ANY KIND.

1197
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,211
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN REPORTS OF 

1198
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,347
ANY SHOTS FIRED IN THE LAST 

1199
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:09,547
HOUR.

1200
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,947
SINCE ABOUT 2:30 ON THE SCENE 

1201
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:11,782
THERE IN FLORIDA.

1202
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:15,152
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

1203
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,887
>> WELL, OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS, 

1204
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,658
THE SHOOTERS EVENTUALLY COMMIT 

1205
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:20,891
SUICIDE.

1206
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:23,893
BUT YOU HAVE TO TREAT IT AS IF 

1207
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:25,096
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

1208
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,731
IF THEY DO WHATEVER THEY'RE 

1209
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:28,966
DOING, HURT AS MANY PEOPLE AS 

1210
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:32,036
THEY CAN, AND THEN THEY GET 

1211
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,103
CORNERED, THEY ALMOST 

1212
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,438
IMMEDIATELY COMMIT SUICIDE.

1213
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,773
THE OFFICERS NOT KNOWING WHAT 

1214
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,841
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE HAVE TO 

1215
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:40,311
TREAT IT AS IF HE'S STILL ON THE

1216
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,213
LOOSE, STILL ACTIVELY TRYING TO 

1217
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:42,847
HURT PEOPLE.

1218
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,181
BUT THAT ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF 

1219
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:46,283
SUICIDE MIGHT BE WHAT WE'RE 

1220
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:47,451
EXPERIENCING NOW.

1221
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,085
>> SO, THERE ARE TWO IMMEDIATE 

1222
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:51,188
JOBS, EVACUATE THE STUDENTS 

1223
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:51,389
THERE.

1224
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,289
FIND THE SHOOTER?

1225
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,690
>> YES.

1226
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,761
YOU KNOW, FIRST, OF COURSE, TEND

1227
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,330
TO THE JIR INJURED OR WOUNDED I 

1228
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,165
THAT'S THE CASE.

1229
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,900
BUT AGAIN, THE SOONER YOU CAN 

1230
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,635
NEUTRALIZE THE SUSPECT, THE 

1231
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,170
SAFER EVERYONE WILL BE.

1232
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,839
SO, OFFICERS WON'T BE WAITING TO

1233
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,975
GO IN SEARCH AND SEEK OUT THIS 

1234
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:11,275
SHOOTER.

1235
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,243
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.

1236
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,477
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WEIGHING IN 

1237
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:15,479
ON TWITTER RIGHT NOW SAYING MY 

1238
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:17,314
PRAYERS AND CONDOLENCES TO THE 

1239
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:19,283
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS OF 

1240
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,317
TERRIBLE FLORIDA SHOOTING.

1241
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:23,621
NO CHILD, TEACHER OR ANYONE ELSE

1242
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,523
SHOULD EVER FEEL UNSAFE IN AN 

1243
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,891
AMERICAN SCHOOL.

1244
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:27,891
PIERRE THOMAS, SO OFTEN, THEY 

1245
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:28,058
DO.

1246
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:31,062
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.

1247
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,599
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS SUCH A TENSE 

1248
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:34,866
SITUATION.

1249
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,600
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO 

1250
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,535
REMIND PEOPLE AS WELL, I SPOKE 

1251
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,471
WITH THE FBI MANY TIMES AND 

1252
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,139
THEY'VE DONE TRAINING WITH THESE

1253
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,073
LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.

1254
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:44,608
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY 

1255
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:45,809
EMPHASIZE IS FOR THE POLICE TO 

1256
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,012
GET IN AND ENGAGE THE SHOOTER AS

1257
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,513
THE FIRST PRIORITY.

1258
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:51,882
BECAUSE, IF YOU CAN DISTRACT THE

1259
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,484
SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS, YOU CAN 

1260
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,019
SAVE LIVES AND BEGIN TO GET 

1261
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:55,553
PEOPLE OUT.

1262
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,488
WE'RE NOW, I'M EXPECTING TO HEAR

1263
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,290
BACK FROM A SOURCE NOW TO GET AN

1264
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,292
UPDATE ON WHETHER THE SHOOTER 

1265
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,293
HAS BEEN FOUND OR NOT.

1266
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,028
AGENCY OF A FEW MINUTES WE DID 

1267
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,462
NOT HAVE REPORTING THAT HE WAS 

1268
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:06,964
IN CUSTODY.

1269
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,599
I'M NOT GOING TO DO SOME 

1270
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,700
ADDITION ALONG REPORTING RIGHT 

1271
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,167
NOW, GEORGE.

1272
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,735
>> WHY DON'T YOU GO DO THAT 

1273
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:12,803
RIGHT NOW.

1274
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,672
MEANTIME, WE HAVE OTHER PICTURES

1275
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,173
COMING IN, AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS 

1276
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,776
THERE OF A SCENE NEARBY THE HIGH

1277
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,009
SCHOOL.

1278
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:20,377
WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT'S 

1279
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:21,178
HAPPENING THERE.

1280
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,346
WE SEE SEVERAL POLICE ON THE 

1281
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:22,880
SCENE.

1282
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,281
AGAIN, BRAD GARRETT, WHY DON'T 

1283
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:27,051
YOU WATCH THIS WITH US, FORMER 

1284
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,953
FBI SPECIAL AGENT.

1285
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:29,987
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT 

1286
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,655
OF ACTIVITY BUT THERE ARE, YOU 

1287
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:33,424
KNOW, JUST DOZENS AND DOZENS OF 

1288
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,259
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ON THE

1289
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:35,459
SCENE.

1290
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,827
>> WELL, OF COURSE.

1291
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,896
AND THE INITIAL RESPONSE, 

1292
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,731
GEORGE, WHEN YOU SAY ACTIVE 

1293
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:43,634
SCHOOL SHOOTER, YOU'RE GOING TO 

1294
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,670
GET BASICALLY ALL HANDS ON DECK.

1295
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,171
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF 

1296
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,341
THE DOZENS OF UNIFORMED, OR 

1297
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,842
VEHICLES AT THE SCENE.

1298
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,278
SO, AS THIS BREAKS DOWN, YOU'RE 

1299
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,347
GOING TO SEE THESE OFFICERS.

1300
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,683
AND NOBODY APPEARS TO BE MOVING 

1301
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:03,788
AT -- YOU KNOW, AT BREAKNECK 

1302
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:03,988
SPEED.

1303
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:04,655
BECAUSE I THINK THEY ALREADY 

1304
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:05,723
HAVE A PLAN.

1305
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,325
EITHER THE SHOOTER'S DOWN.

1306
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,060
OR HE'S IN A PLACE WHERE HE 

1307
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,429
HOPEFULLY CANNOT HARM PEOPLE.

1308
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,564
NOW, I REALIZE THERE'S THE 

1309
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,399
POSSIBILITY, IS HE BARRICADED IN

1310
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,834
A ROOM WITH OTHER KIDS? 

1311
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,169
I SUPPOSE THAT'S POSSIBLE.

1312
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,570
HOPEFULLY, THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

1313
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:25,576
>> AND, BRAD, I'M JUST 

1314
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,443
SPECUSPECULATE

1315
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,946
ING HERE, BUT WE SAW IT FROM THE

1316
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:29,179
AERIALS.

1317
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:30,848
YOU SEE THE POLICE CARS THAT 

1318
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,149
SEEM TO BE DOWN THE ROAD AND 

1319
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,551
ACROSS THE HIGHWAY FROM THE 

1320
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:33,784
SCHOOL.

1321
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:34,985
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN 

1322
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:36,920
PAST SHOOTINGS IS POLICE GO TO 

1323
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,722
THE HOME OF THE SUSPECT WHO MAY 

1324
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,156
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO SEE WHAT

1325
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:42,393
THEY CAN FIND THERE IMMEDIATELY.

1326
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,361
>> OF COURSE.

1327
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,931
I MEAN, THE REAL KEY IS INTEL.

1328
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,733
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 

1329
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:49,933
SHOOTER, WHAT THE INTENTION WAS 

1330
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,135
TAKING THE SCHOOL.

1331
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,737
WHAT WEAPONS ARE IN THE HOUSE?

1332
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,939
DOES HE KNOW HOW TO BUILD 

1333
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,306
EXPLOSIVES?

1334
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,109
DOES HE USE EXPLOSIVES?

1335
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,343
IS HE PROFICIENT WITH FIREARMS? 

1336
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,412
ALL OF THESE THINGS YOU WANT TO 

1337
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,312
KNOW, BECAUSE IF IN FACT HE'S 

1338
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:04,448
STILL ALIVE, IT INFORMS HOW YOU 

1339
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,416
MAY APPROACH HIM.

1340
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,052
>> AND CECILIA VEGA AT THE WHITE

1341
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:08,252
HOUSE.

1342
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,653
WE JUST READ THAT TWEET FROM 

1343
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:10,454
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

1344
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,422
THIS HAS THE WHITE HOUSE 

1345
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,123
SCRAMBLING AS WELL?

1346
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,058
>> YES, AND CERTAIN, YOU CAN 

1347
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:14,858
IMAGINE HERE IN THIS WHITE HOUSE

1348
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:16,494
THAT THE TELEVISIONS ARE ON FOR 

1349
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,228
THIS PRESIDENT.

1350
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,629
AND THAT HE'S SEEING THESE 

1351
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,197
SCENES THAT WE'RE ALL WATCHING 

1352
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,832
NOW AS A NATION RIGHT NOW.

1353
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,799
WE'RE TOLD BY THIS WHITE HOUSE 

1354
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:24,601
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ACTIVELY 

1355
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,536
MONITORING THE SITUATION.

1356
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,105
WE KNOW FROM FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR 

1357
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:28,639
RICK SCOTT.

1358
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,007
BOTH OF THEM HAVE SPOKEN.

1359
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,409
THE GOVERNOR HAS GIVEN PRESIDENT

1360
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,877
TRUMP AN UPDATE.

1361
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,379
WE'VE ALSO IN THE LAST FEW 

1362
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,513
MINUTES HEARD FROM THE FIRST 

1363
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:37,714
LADY WHO SAYS SHE JOINS THE 

1364
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:39,216
PRESIDENT IN EXTENDING HER 

1365
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,452
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.

1366
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,822
WE'RE HEARING FROM A SYMPHONY OF

1367
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,658
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIONS AS 

1368
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,292
WELL.

1369
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,494
FROM MARCO RUBIO, A NUMBER OF 

1370
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,198
HOUSE MEMBERS AS WELL ACTIVELY 

1371
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,198
MONITORING THE SITUATION.

1372
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:56,567
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS FIRST 

1373
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,001
YEAR IN OFFICE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT 

1374
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,103
MASS SHOOTINGS THREE TIME, I 

1375
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:04,141
SHOULD SAY, THREE TIMES HE HAS 

1376
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,477
ADDRESSED THE NATION ABOUT MASS 

1377
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:06,744
SHOOTINGS.

1378
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,278
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS TIME HAD 

1379
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:10,047
TO DO THIS 17 TIMES, GEORGE.

1380
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,816
WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS A BIT

1381
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,116
OF A PATTERN UNFOLD IN 

1382
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:14,752
WASHINGTON IN THE WAKE OF THESE 

1383
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:15,986
SHOOTINGS, AS WELL, WHERE WE 

1384
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,521
HEAR IN THE DAYS FOR THE CALLS 

1385
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,524
FOR GUN CONTROL WHERE WE HEAR 

1386
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,593
THE DISCUSSION OVER MENTAL 

1387
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:22,826
HEALTH.

1388
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:25,696
ON BOTH SIDES, I THINK ONE 

1389
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,897
UNIFYING AGREEMENT HERE, 

1390
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,233
EVERYBODY IS WONDERING HOW 

1391
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,068
OFTEN, HOW MORE TIMES ARE WE 

1392
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,670
GO 

1393
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:37,374
CONVERSATION AS A NATION.

1394
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,510
REPRESENTATIVE FREDRICERICA WIL,

1395
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,879
GEORGE, FROM FLORIDA, IT'S 

1396
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,547
HEARTBREAKING THAT THESE VIOLENT

1397
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,781
INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE IN SCHOOLS 

1398
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:46,417
WHERE OUR CHILDREN SHOULD FEEL 

1399
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:46,617
SAFE.

1400
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,519
>> AS YOU WERE SPEAKING THE 

1401
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,255
PRESIDENT TWEETED AGAIN, JUST 

1402
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,990
SPOKE TO GOVERNOR SCOTT, WE'RE 

1403
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,691
WORKING TOGETHER ON THE TERRIBLE

1404
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:58,162
SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1405
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,697
WE HEARD FROM CHRIS MURPHREE 

1406
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:04,768
FROM CONNECTICUT FROM THE SCENE 

1407
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:06,804
OF THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTING.

1408
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,907
HE SAID TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION.

1409
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,809
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE STUDENTS

1410
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,612
RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.

1411
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,814
IT'S 18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, AND 

1412
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:20,351
WE'VE NOT HIT MARCH.

1413
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,185
PIERRE, I DO WANT TO POINT OUT 

1414
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:23,487
THAT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE 

1415
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,255
POLICE MAY HAVE SOMEONE IN HAND 

1416
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:25,756
CUFFS THERE.

1417
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,458
DON'T HAVE A CLEAR, A CLEAR VIEW

1418
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,225
OF THAT.

1419
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,993
YOU'RE ALSO TRYING TO GET MORE 

1420
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:31,228
INFORMATION FROM YOUR SOURCES? 

1421
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,863
>> WE'RE STILL WORKING IT, 

1422
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:33,096
GEORGE.

1423
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:35,733
BUT TO PICK UP ON YOUR POINT, 18

1424
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,001
SHOOTINGS SO FAR THIS YEAR, 

1425
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,602
WE'VE SEEN SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS.

1426
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,671
WE'VE SEEN SHOOTINGS AT MALLS.

1427
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,640
WE'VE SEEN SHOOTINGS IN MOVIE 

1428
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,374
THEATERS.

1429
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,141
VIRTUALLY EVERY PLACE THAT WE 

1430
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:47,711
CALL SACRED, INCLUDING CHURCHES.

1431
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,380
WE JUST RECALL THAT MASSIVE 

1432
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,383
SHOOTING IN THE CHURCH JUST A 

1433
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:52,750
FEW MONTHS AGO.

1434
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,518
THIS IS NOW PART OF THE NATIONAL

1435
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,620
NORM IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE 

1436
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,323
PEOPLE WHO HAVE VARIOUS ISSUES, 

1437
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,158
BE IT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, BE 

1438
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,260
IT TERRORISM ISSUES, BE IT JUST 

1439
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,661
GRIEVANCES TAKE OUT THEIR 

1440
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,463
CARNAGE ON PEOPLE IN THE MOST 

1441
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,232
VULNERABLE OF SITUATIONS.

1442
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,000
SO-CALLED SOFT TARGETS, AS WE'VE

1443
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,433
HEARD SO MANY TIMES.

1444
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:12,102
>> IT REALLY IS THE KIND OF 

1445
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,904
THING WHERE WE HAVE TO STOP FOR 

1446
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,307
A SECOND, TAKE A STEP BACK, TAKE

1447
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,474
A DEEP BREATH AND THINK ABOUT 

1448
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:18,676
WHAT THAT MEANS.

1449
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,878
18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THIS YEAR.

1450
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:21,712
IT'S FEBRUARY 14th.

1451
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,714
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.

1452
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,516
NOW, SOME OF THESE WILL INVOLVE,

1453
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,286
YOU KNOW, STUDENTS IN SITUATIONS

1454
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,754
WHERE THERE'S DISAGREEMENTS AND 

1455
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,289
GUNS WERE PULLED OUT.

1456
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,857
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT 

1457
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:36,327
THAT THOSE WE CHERISH THE MOST, 

1458
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,964
CHILDREN, ARE NOW SEEING THESE 

1459
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,065
KIND OF INSTANCES HAPPEN 

1460
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,566
ROUTINELY, GEORGE.

1461
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,068
>> AND BRAD GARRETT, I WANT TO 

1462
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:47,137
BRING IN OUR FORMER SPECIAL 

1463
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,872
AGENT BRAD GARRETT AS WELL.

1464
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:51,775
WE SEE THE POLICE AND IT DOES 

1465
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:52,976
APPEAR THAT THEY MAY HAVE 

1466
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:54,945
SOMEONE IN HANDCUFFS RIGHT 

1467
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:55,145
THERE.

1468
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,681
BUT WE'RE STILL BEING TOLD IT'S 

1469
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,049
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION?

1470
00:41:59,049 --> 00:41:59,717
>> RIGHT.

1471
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:03,654
UNTIL, GEORGE, THEY SLIABSOLUTE 

1472
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,022
KNOW IT'S JUST ONE SHOOTER.

1473
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,257
THEY MAY HAVE SOMEONE IN 

1474
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:07,490
CUSTODY.

1475
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,360
ALL OF THE INTEL, THEY TELL YOU,

1476
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,127
IT'S ONE STUDENT.

1477
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,562
BUT UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW 

1478
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,030
THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO TREAT IT 

1479
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,331
AS UNRESOLVED.

1480
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,332
>> UNRESOLVED.

1481
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,034
AS YOU SAID, THEY'RE TRITE NOW 

1482
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,536
GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH EVERY 

1483
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:21,138
BUILDING, EVERY ROOM, IN EVERY 

1484
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,774
BUILDING EVER THAT SCHOOL.

1485
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,609
STEP-BY-STEP, PIECE BY PIECE.

1486
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,477
UNTIL THEY'RE SURE THAT 

1487
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:28,345
EVERYBODY IS OUT?

1488
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:28,978
>> EXACTLY.

1489
00:42:28,978 --> 00:42:30,914
AND IN PARTICULAR, THE BUILDING 

1490
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:32,783
WHERE THE SHOOTER IS BECAUSE MY 

1491
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,818
SENSE IS, AS YOU AND I TALKED I 

1492
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,620
FEW MINUTES AGO THAT THE 

1493
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,122
SHOOTING MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN 

1494
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:38,922
ONE BUILDING.

1495
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:39,323
>> RIGHT.

1496
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,258
AND WE DID HEAR FROM ONE OF THE 

1497
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,528
STUDENTS ON THE SCENE, 

1498
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,096
ALEXANDRIA ROBINSON, THAT SHE 

1499
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,765
DID BELIEVE FROM AREAS THAT SHE 

1500
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:50,133
WAS HEARING FROM THE SCHOOL THAT

1501
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:52,302
THE SHOOTER HAD BEEN IN THE 

1502
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,870
FRESHMEN AREA, ISOLATED IN ONE 

1503
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,938
OF THE BUILDINGS?

1504
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:56,940
>> AND THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE, 

1505
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,775
BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAD A 

1506
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:00,911
LOT OF SHOTS AND THEN WE DIDN'T 

1507
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,612
HAVE ANYTHING.

1508
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,780
WHICH SUGGESTS, YOU KNOW, GOING 

1509
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,816
BACK TO VIRGINIA TECH, SHOWED 

1510
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:12,156
BASICALLY THEY WENT ONIN AGAIN.

1511
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,957
I WANT TO PUT THAT UP ON THE 

1512
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:14,224
SCREEN.

1513
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,659
WE ALREADY SHOWED THAT.

1514
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,227
THAT WAS -- JUST SPOKE TO 

1515
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,495
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT AND I'M 

1516
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,797
BEING TOLD ANOTHER ONE IS COMING

1517
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,032
IN RIGHT NOW AS WELL.

1518
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,534
JUST SPOKE TO GOVERNOR RICK 

1519
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:23,734
SCOTT.

1520
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,303
WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH LAW 

1521
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,204
ENFORCEMENT FOR THIS TERRIBLE 

1522
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,106
FLORIDA SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1523
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,774
THAT IS WHAT WE HEAR NOW FROM 

1524
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,308
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

1525
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,843
IT'S COMING UP ON 4:00 P.M. 

1526
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,745
EASTERN TIME RIGHT NOW HERE IN 

1527
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,747
NEW YORK CITY AS WE ARE WATCHING

1528
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:37,614
THOSE LIVE PICTURES THERE FROM 

1529
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:40,050
SOUTH FLORIDA FROM THE STONEMAN 

1530
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,585
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN PARKLAND,

1531
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,121
FLORIDA WHERE AT AROUND 2:20 

1532
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,690
P.M. THIS AFTERNOON A SCHOOL 

1533
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,557
SHOOTING UNFOLDED, STILL BEING 

1534
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:49,727
DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE SHOOTING 

1535
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:49,994
SITUATION.

1536
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,195
ACCORDING TO POLICE ON THE 

1537
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,464
SCENE, IT IS A MASS CASUALTY 

1538
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,299
EVENT, REPORTS OF UP TO 20 

1539
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:55,699
PEOPLE INJURED.

1540
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,333
POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED AT LEAST 

1541
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,368
ONE DEAD ACCORDING TO ONE 

1542
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,204
STUDENT WE SPOKE TO INSIDE THE 

1543
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:00,437
SCHOOL.

1544
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,506
THAT STUDENT ALSO SAW TWO BODIES

1545
00:44:03,506 --> 00:44:05,142
OUTSIDE HIS CLASSROOM.

1546
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,010
WE'VE SEEN POLICE FOR THE LAST 

1547
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,979
HOUR OR SO TWEETING SOME OF THE 

1548
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,480
INJURED.

1549
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,349
THERE YOU SEE ONE BEING WHEELED 

1550
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,052
AWAY ON A STRETCHER, EVACUATING 

1551
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:17,621
FROM THE SCHOOL UP UNTIL MOMENTS

1552
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,791
AGO, PARENTS WITHIN TEXT CONTACT

1553
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,694
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

1554
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:24,361
THIS HIGH SCHOOL HAS TEN 

1555
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,262
BUILDINGS, SEVERAL THOUSAND 

1556
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,064
STUDENTS, ACCORDING TO MICHAEL 

1557
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,699
KATZ, ONE OF THE STUDENTS WE 

1558
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,001
SPOKE WITH, THE SHOOTING WENT ON

1559
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,604
FOR ABOUT FOUR TO SIX MINUTES, 

1560
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,672
TOO MANY SHOTS TO COUNT.

1561
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:36,940
HE SAID IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS OF 

1562
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,910
THE SCHOOL -- THERE YOU SEE THE 

1563
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,477
STUDENTS RUNNING OUT OF THE 

1564
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,145
SCHOOL.

1565
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,181
THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING OUT IN 

1566
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,916
PERIODIC BURSTS.

1567
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:46,616
THIS IS STILL BEING DESCRIBED AS

1568
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:48,752
AN ACTIVE SHOOTING SITUATION.

1569
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:49,786
WE'VE SEEN PICTURES OF ONE 

1570
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:52,322
PERSON BEING TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

1571
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,723
WE DON'T KNOW YET WHETHER THAT 

1572
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:55,592
WAS THE SHOOTER.

1573
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:56,260
THE POLICE ARE STILL TREATING 

1574
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,161
THIS AS AN ACTIVE SITUATION.

1575
00:44:58,161 --> 00:44:59,530
SO MUCH CONCERN THERE IN SOUTH 

1576
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,731
FLORIDA RIGHT NOW.

1577
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:01,832
TOM LLAMAS, YOU REPORTED FROM 

1578
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,700
THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND YOU'VE 

1579
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,001
SEEN A MASSIVE RESPONSE OVER 

1580
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:05,803
THIS LAST HOUR. 

1581
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,471
>> Reporter: YEAH, I WAS TALKING

1582
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,306
TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE WHO 

1583
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,907
TOLD ME THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S 

1584
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:12,042
DEPARTMENT WHICH IS ONE OF THE 

1585
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,844
LEADS IN THIS SITUATION HAS 

1586
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,145
TRAINED FOR THESE TYPES OF 

1587
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,915
SITUATIONS WITH BOTH THE MIAMI 

1588
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:18,482
POLICE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER 

1589
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,049
AGENCIES THROUGHOUT SOUTH 

1590
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:19,283
FLORIDA.

1591
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,318
THIS IS A PICTURE THAT WE SAW 

1592
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,554
EARLIER.

1593
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,321
THIS SEEMS TO BE A YOUNG PERSON 

1594
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,355
IN HANDCUFFS.

1595
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,490
IT'S A LITTLE FAR FOR US TO SEE 

1596
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,492
THE EXACT AGE.

1597
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,926
ONE OF THE THEORIES THEY WERE 

1598
00:45:29,926 --> 00:45:30,694
WORKING AT THE TIME AND IT 

1599
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,130
STANDS TO REASON WAS THAT THE 

1600
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,131
SHOOTER POSSIBLY WAS A YOUNG 

1601
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:34,565
PERSON.

1602
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,699
WE'RE NOT SURE IF IT WAS A 

1603
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,367
STUDENT OR SOMEONE WHO WENT TO 

1604
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,969
ANOTHER SCHOOL, BUT THAT WAS ONE

1605
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:39,569
OF THE THINGS THEY WERE 

1606
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:40,904
FOLLOWING IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE 

1607
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,905
THEY WEREN'T SURE WHO THE 

1608
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,840
SHOOTER WAS.

1609
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,674
AGAIN, PART OF THE MIXUP AND 

1610
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:46,209
PART OF THE CONFUSION HERE 

1611
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:47,778
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME 

1612
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,680
SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN WORD FROM ANY

1613
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,081
POLICE AGENCY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

1614
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,883
ON IS THAT THERE WERE SO MANY 

1615
00:45:53,883 --> 00:45:56,053
STUDENTS AT BOTH OF THESE 

1616
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:59,356
SCHOOLS.

1617
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,123
STONEMAN DOUGLAS, 3,000 KIDS AND

1618
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:01,525
THE NEARBY WEST GLADES MIDDLE 

1619
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,795
PARK, 1500.

1620
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:05,362
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLICE 

1621
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,463
DEPARTMENT BUT IT'S A COUNTY 

1622
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,631
POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 

1623
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:08,765
NEIGHBORING CORAL SPRINGS HAS A 

1624
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:09,666
LARGER POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT 

1625
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,500
RAN OVER THERE.

1626
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,501
YOU CAN SEE A STUDENT RIGHT 

1627
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:13,069
THERE JUST OVERCOME WITH BRIEF 

1628
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,271
HAVING TO LIVE THROUGH THIS, 

1629
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,271
GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL ONE DAY IN 

1630
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:16,873
THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AND 

1631
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:19,142
DEALING WITH POSSIBLY UP TO 20 

1632
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:21,545
STUDENTS AND/OR FACULTY INJURED 

1633
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,278
IN THE SHOOTING. 

1634
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:24,715
>> WE SAW AN INSTANCE RESPONSE 

1635
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,116
FROM POLICE THROUGHOUT THE AREA.

1636
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:26,983
WE ALSO LEARNED FROM SOME OF THE

1637
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:28,385
STUDENTS INSIDE THAT THE 

1638
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,420
STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO REACT 

1639
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,922
QUICKLY, STUDENTS AND TEACHERS 

1640
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,225
BOTH ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY.

1641
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:35,859
SO MANY SCHOOLS HAVE NOW TRAINED

1642
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:36,893
FOR THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

1643
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:40,063
EVERYBODY TAUGHT TO GET DOWN, 

1644
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:40,496
GET OUT IF YOU CAN.

1645
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:43,033
GET DOWN IF YOU MUST, BARRICADE 

1646
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:43,800
YOURSELF INSIDE.

1647
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,767
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE STUDENTS

1648
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:48,972
THAT WE SPOKE WITH EARLIER, IT 

1649
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,741
SOUNDED LIKE ONE SHOOTER BUT 

1650
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:53,309
COULD NOT BE SURE OF THAT AND WE

1651
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:54,544
HAVE NOT HEARD ANY REPORTS OF 

1652
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:55,913
MORE THAN THAT RIGHT NOW.

1653
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,281
WE'VE JUST BEEN JOINED AT THE 

1654
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:02,285
DESK BY RAY KELLY, FORMER CHIEF 

1655
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:03,787
OF THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE.

1656
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,188
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE 

1657
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:05,522
TRAINING.

1658
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,156
THIS IS DRILLED THROUGH EVERY 

1659
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,658
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE 

1660
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:07,925
COUNTRY. 

1661
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,295
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.

1662
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:11,929
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE REALITY 

1663
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,096
NOW THAT POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE

1664
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:17,200
TO PRACTICE THIS AND THEY DO, 

1665
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,771
INDEED, PRACTICE EXTENSIVELY FOR

1666
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:20,937
IT.

1667
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:23,707
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE APPROPRIATE

1668
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:24,307
RESPONSE, AS WAS SAID BEFORE, 

1669
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:26,476
MULTIPLE POLICE AGENCIES 

1670
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:26,743
INVOLVED.

1671
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:27,744
THEY NOW PRACTICE THAT 

1672
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:28,077
COORDINATION.

1673
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:29,446
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE

1674
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,914
ALL TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE 

1675
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,283
ALL ON THE SAME RADIO FREQUENCY,

1676
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:33,984
THAT SORT OF THING. 

1677
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,853
>> RAY, OUR AFFILIATE, WPLG IN 

1678
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,154
SOUTH FLORIDA IS NOW REPORTING 

1679
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:39,522
THAT THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.

1680
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:40,824
WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT 

1681
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,258
OURSELVES BUT THAT IS BEING 

1682
00:47:42,258 --> 00:47:45,529
REPORTED IN SOUTH FLORIDA BY 

1683
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:45,996
WPLG.

1684
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,432
AND RAY, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY 

1685
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:53,637
WE'RE NOT SEEING A LOT OF HECTIC

1686
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:53,904
ACTIVITY. 

1687
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:54,204
>> RIGHT.

1688
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,306
THINGS LOOK FAIRLY CALM.

1689
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,874
OBVIOUSLY IF HE WERE NOT IN 

1690
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,209
CUSTODY THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF 

1691
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,309
CONCERN ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO 

1692
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,780
SHOOT OUT A WINDOW AND SHOOT 

1693
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,749
FROM A GREAT DISTANCE.

1694
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,150
IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE UNDER 

1695
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,051
CONTROL AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S 

1696
00:48:09,051 --> 00:48:10,787
GOOD NEWS.

1697
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,622
AGAIN, I THINK THE TRAINING AND 

1698
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,190
THE PRACTICE THAT POLICE 

1699
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,361
DEPARTMENTS DO PAID OFF IN THIS 

1700
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:17,628
SITUATION.

1701
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,697
THIS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS THE 

1702
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,832
12th SCHOOL SHOOTING THAT WE'VE 

1703
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:28,171
HAD SO FAR THIS YEAR.

1704
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,539
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

1705
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,242
>> STEVE GOMEZ, FORMER FBI 

1706
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,978
SPECIAL AGENT ALSO JOINING US 

1707
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:35,145
NOW.

1708
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:37,280
AS WE SAID, WPLG, OUR AFFILIATE 

1709
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,582
IN SOUTH FLORIDA, IS REPORTING 

1710
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,017
THAT THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.

1711
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,585
WALK US THROUGH THE NEXT STEPS 

1712
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,986
THAT FBI AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ON 

1713
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:43,854
THE SCENE WOULD TAKE. 

1714
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,221
>> IF THAT IS ONE OF THE 

1715
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,489
SUSPECTS AND THEY'RE CLEARLY 

1716
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:47,490
DOING A FAST INVESTIGATION ON 

1717
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,224
THAT INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THEY'RE 

1718
00:48:48,224 --> 00:48:51,127
GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT DOES 

1719
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:51,995
HE HAVE ASSOCIATES AND IS THAT 

1720
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:55,499
THE ONLY SHOOTER THAT WAS 

1721
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:55,766
INVOLVED.

1722
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,566
INTERVIEWING ALL OF THE STUDENTS

1723
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:01,171
AND FACULTY WHO MAY HAVE HEARD 

1724
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,605
AND SEEN WHAT OCCURRED, THEY'RE 

1725
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,241
GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAS 

1726
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:09,279
IT ONE SHOOTER, MORE THAN ONE.

1727
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,048
AND THEN THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

1728
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,315
IF THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE 

1729
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:14,484
AND THAT COULD EXPAND THE 

1730
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:14,817
INVESTIGATION.

1731
00:49:14,817 --> 00:49:15,652
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE DONE AS 

1732
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,220
FAST AS POSSIBLE IN THE EVENT 

1733
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,355
THERE'S STILL A SUSPECT OUT 

1734
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:18,588
THERE. 

1735
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,757
>> BRAD GARRETT, AGAIN, IF THIS 

1736
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,759
REPORT FROM WPLG IS TRUE THAT 

1737
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,561
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY, 

1738
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,129
RELATIVELY UNUSUAL ENDING TO A 

1739
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,797
SHOOTING INCIDENT LIKE THIS. 

1740
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,166
>> IT IS, GEORGE, BECAUSE 

1741
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,601
TYPICALLY THEY SHOOT THEMSELVES 

1742
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,171
OR THEY MAKE THE COPS SHOOT 

1743
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:34,371
THEM.

1744
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,005
SO IS THIS A SITUATION WHERE THE

1745
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:37,574
POLICE GOT TO HIM BEFORE HE 

1746
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:42,112
COULD DO ONE OR THE OTHER?

1747
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,246
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

1748
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,480
IT REALLY GOES PARTLY TO WHAT 

1749
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,616
HIS MOTIVATION WAS IN COMMITTING

1750
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:47,116
THIS SHOOTING. 

1751
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:49,485
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO 

1752
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:49,819
ASK YOU ABOUT.

1753
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:53,290
THE QUESTION IS WAS IT SOMETHING

1754
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:53,990
TARGETED AGAINST A SPECIFIC 

1755
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,692
STUDENT OR WAS IT JUST SORT OF 

1756
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,627
AN OUTBURST OF ANGER, RAGE. 

1757
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,297
>> IT GOES BOTH WAYS.

1758
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,797
TYPICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A SMALL 

1759
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,366
NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHOT, IT'S 

1760
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:04,868
USUALLY PERSONAL.

1761
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,937
IT'S USUALLY DIRECTED AT A 

1762
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,806
TEACHER, AT PARTICULAR STUDENTS,

1763
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:10,774
ET CETERA.

1764
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,209
WHEN YOU HAVE MORE MASS 

1765
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:12,843
CASUALTIES WHERE SOMEBODY JUST 

1766
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,212
WALKED INTO A ROOM AND STARTS 

1767
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,679
GUNNING PEOPLE DOWN, WHICH 

1768
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:19,549
SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, 

1769
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:24,754
THIS IS SORT OF MORE GLOBAL RAGE

1770
00:50:24,754 --> 00:50:25,187
TOWARD THE SCHOOL. 

1771
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:26,389
>> BRAD, THE PROFILE IS 

1772
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:27,857
SOMETHING THAT WE SEE TIME AND 

1773
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:31,928
TIME AGAIN, YOUNG MEN GENERALLY 

1774
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:35,832
ISOLATED, HARBORING SOME KIND OF

1775
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:36,699
SOMETIMES MENTAL ILLNESS BUT A 

1776
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:39,469
LOT OF RAGE AND THEY JUST BURST.

1777
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,505
>> WELL, IT'S A BUILDUP.

1778
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,173
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING TO 

1779
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,675
DECIDE TOMORROW TO DO A SCHOOL 

1780
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:45,942
SHOOTING.

1781
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:46,776
I'M GOING TO DECIDE FOR SEVERAL 

1782
00:50:46,776 --> 00:50:48,712
MONTHS I'M GOING TO DO A SCHOOL 

1783
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,679
SHOOTING.

1784
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,116
AS IT GOES THROUGH, HE FEELS 

1785
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,851
ANGER, RAGE, POWERLESS.

1786
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,319
SO WHAT DO YOU DO IF ALL THOSE 

1787
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,421
THINGS ARE GOING ON?

1788
00:50:58,421 --> 00:51:01,992
YOU SEEK REVENGE AND YOU GAIN 

1789
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:02,192
POWER.

1790
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,160
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER?

1791
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,027
KILLING PEOPLE. 

1792
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:08,298
>> BRAD, WHY BOYS, NOT GIRLS?

1793
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:20,076
>> BECAUSE BOYS TEND TO BE MORE 

1794
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:20,376
AGGRESSIVE.

1795
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:22,312
IT'S JUST HER EDUCATTY, HISTORY.

1796
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,080
I WILL TELL YOU THAT WOMEN ARE 

1797
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,416
BECOMING MORE AGGRESSIVE AS FAR 

1798
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,584
AS OTHER SHOOTINGS.

1799
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,952
HOMICIDE RATES A LITTLE BIT ARE 

1800
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,221
UP IN REFERENCE TO WOMEN.

1801
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,289
WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN VIOLENT 

1802
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,923
CRIMES HISTORICALLY THAT WERE 

1803
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,159
EXCLUSIVELY MEN, THEY'RE NOW 

1804
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:36,426
OPERATING.

1805
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,728
TO YOUR QUESTION, I REALLY THINK

1806
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,931
IT'S JUST HOW MEN DEMONSTRATE 

1807
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,299
AND GET -- THIS IS HOW THEY DEAL

1808
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:46,136
WITH THEIR ANGER AND RAGE VERSUS

1809
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,371
A GIRL MAY SEND SOME AWFUL TEXTS

1810
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,273
TO PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM FEEL 

1811
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:50,473
BAD. 

1812
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:52,275
>> PIERRE THOMAS, WE'VE SEEN 

1813
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,043
TRAINING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND 

1814
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,144
TRAINING INSIDE SCHOOLS, 

1815
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:56,279
TRAINING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

1816
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,847
WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS

1817
00:51:57,847 --> 00:52:01,184
GO UP EVERY SINGLE MONTH.

1818
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,586
>> WE HAVE, GEORGE.

1819
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,054
ONE OF THE THINGS, IF THEY HAVE 

1820
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,788
THE SUSPECT IN CUSTODY, THEY 

1821
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:08,792
WILL DO AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND 

1822
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,626
CHECK IMMEDIATELY.

1823
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,027
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WOULD 

1824
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,529
WANT TO FIGURE OUT IS DOES THIS 

1825
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:15,565
PERSON HAVE ANY TIES TO 

1826
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:15,832
TERRORISM.

1827
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,101
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH 

1828
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,869
MULTIPLE SOURCES.

1829
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:21,871
NO ONE IS POINTING AT THAT AT 

1830
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:22,706
ALL.

1831
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:23,906
THEY'RE WORKING ON THE 

1832
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:25,008
ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS SOMEONE 

1833
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,509
AFFILIATED WITH THE SCHOOL, 

1834
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:28,077
SOMEONE YOUNG IS ONE THEORY I'M 

1835
00:52:28,077 --> 00:52:29,312
BEING TOLD ABOUT, GEORGE.

1836
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,213
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE 

1837
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,914
SEEING OVER AND OVER IN THESE 

1838
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:34,150
CASES AS BRAD AS TALKED ABOUT IS

1839
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,286
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE, TYPICALLY 

1840
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:40,190
MALE, DISGRUNTLED WITH ACCESS TO

1841
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:40,423
WEAPONS.

1842
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,759
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, 

1843
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,494
GEORGE, AND THE FACT THAT THERE 

1844
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,829
ARE ALREADY 300 MILLION GUNS 

1845
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:47,696
SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY.

1846
00:52:47,696 --> 00:52:49,766
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S A 

1847
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,267
VEXING ISSUE, A CHRONIC PROBLEM 

1848
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:52,101
OF VIOLENCE. 

1849
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,737
>> WE WANT TO GO BACK TO OUR 

1850
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:58,108
AFFILIATE ON THE SCENE TALKING 

1851
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,143
TO SOME OF THE PARENTS OF THE 

1852
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:00,843
STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL. 

1853
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:03,713
>> SHE'S NOT ON THE BUS YET.

1854
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:04,947
SHE SENT ME A PICTURE AND SHE'S 

1855
00:53:04,947 --> 00:53:05,148
OKAY. 

1856
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,683
>> DID YOU GET WIND OF THIS 

1857
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,651
BEFORE YOU HEARD FROM HER?

1858
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,819
>> I WAS ACTUALLY ON A CALL WITH

1859
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:10,853
WORK AND MY PHONE WAS BLOWING UP

1860
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:11,688
FROM MY WIFE.

1861
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,556
I GOT OFF, CALLED HER BACK AND I

1862
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:15,358
SAW THE TEXT MESSAGES SO I 

1863
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,561
PARKED AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1864
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:22,232
MY WIFE IS AT THE ELEMENTARY 

1865
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:22,499
SCHOOL.

1866
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,067
THEY'RE ON LOCKDOWN, CODE RED.

1867
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,434
SHE WAS IN A TEACHER CONFERENCE 

1868
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:27,236
AND THEY'RE STUCK IN THERE. 

1869
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:28,772
>> DID SHE HEAR ANYTHING, SEE 

1870
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,039
ANYTHING?

1871
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,474
DID SHE JUST GET SHOVED IN A 

1872
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:31,741
CLASSROOM?

1873
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:32,909
>> SHE SAID SOME OF HER FRIENDS 

1874
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,210
SAW SOMETHING BUT I'M NOT GOING 

1875
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,211
TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. 

1876
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:38,247
>> AS A PARENT, HOW MUCH OF A 

1877
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:39,582
RELIEF WAS IT?

1878
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:40,983
>> IT WAS A LITTLE EMOTIONAL IN 

1879
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:41,885
THE BEGINNING.

1880
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,453
IT WAS A GOOD SET OF EMOTIONS 

1881
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,386
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD BECAUSE 

1882
00:53:44,386 --> 00:53:46,289
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AS

1883
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,190
YOU'RE WALKING UP HERE.

1884
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,992
I WAS COMFORTING A MOTHER OVER 

1885
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:54,497
HERE WHO HAS FOUR SONS HERE AND 

1886
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,066
SHE HEARD FROM THREE OF THEM AND

1887
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,802
SHE HADN'T HEARD FROM THE FOURTH

1888
00:53:58,802 --> 00:53:59,436
ONE.

1889
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,303
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S OKAY. 

1890
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,671
>> YOUR DAUGHTER IS TELLING YOU 

1891
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:06,876
THEY'RE TAKING HER WHERE?

1892
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,511
>> THE MAYORRRIOTT.

1893
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,679
I WAS GOING TO HEAD OVER THAT 

1894
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,815
WAY BUT SHE TOLD ME TO MEET HER 

1895
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:12,248
AT THE MARRIOTT. 

1896
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,816
>> HEARING FROM A RELIEVED 

1897
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:15,151
PARENT RIGHT THERE.

1898
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,952
SO MANY PARENTS SO DESPERATE TO 

1899
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:18,187
BE IN TOUCH WITH THEIR STUDENTS 

1900
00:54:18,187 --> 00:54:19,823
WHO WERE INSIDE THAT SCHOOL TO 

1901
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:20,523
KNOW THEY WERE SAFE.

1902
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,392
THEY USE THEIR PHONES, THEY 

1903
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,460
TEXT.

1904
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,961
MARTHA RADDATZ, YOU'RE SAYING 

1905
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:28,298
THE STUDENTS SHOULD NOT TWEET?

1906
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,232
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD 

1907
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,302
IDEA AT ALL TO TWEET, ESPECIALLY

1908
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:32,869
IF THEY STILL HAD AN ACTIVE 

1909
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,437
SHOOTER IN THAT SCHOOL OR THEY 

1910
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,805
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING 

1911
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:36,806
AND CONSIDERING THEY WERE STILL 

1912
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,808
ON LOCKDOWN WHEN THEY WERE 

1913
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,577
TWEETING, IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

1914
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,979
ANYBODY CAN READ THOSE TWEETS.

1915
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:43,846
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE BEEN 

1916
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:44,547
READING THE TWEETS.

1917
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,081
>> MARTHA, WE'VE SEEN THAT IN 

1918
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,717
THE PAST WITH THE ORLANDO 

1919
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:48,952
SHOOTING NOW MORE THAN A YEAR 

1920
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:49,552
AND A HALF AGO.

1921
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,386
WE KNOW THE SHOOTER WAS 

1922
00:54:50,386 --> 00:54:52,021
FOLLOWING THE COVERAGE.

1923
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:53,256
>> EXACTLY, FOLLOWING THE 

1924
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,658
COVERAGE, LISTENING FOR THE 

1925
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:57,794
SOUNDS FROM THE CLASSROOMS.

1926
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,229
IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO 

1927
00:54:59,229 --> 00:54:59,629
DO.

1928
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,529
I KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ON 

1929
00:55:00,529 --> 00:55:01,664
SOCIAL MEDIA ALL THE TIME.

1930
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:03,265
WE'RE ALL ON SOCIAL MEDIA ALL 

1931
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:05,601
THE TIME BUT YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE 

1932
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:08,070
ANYBODY ANY INFORMATION.

1933
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,138
CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE IN A PLACE 

1934
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:11,074
WHERE YOU FEEL SAFE AND YOU WANT

1935
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,275
TO TEXT YOUR PARENTS AND TELL 

1936
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,777
THEM THAT AND THEY CAN PASS THAT

1937
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:17,413
ON TO THE POLICE FORCE BUT 

1938
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:18,815
PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT 

1939
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,615
ON SOCIAL MEDIA UNTIL THIS IS 

1940
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:21,684
OVER AND UNTIL WE KNOW AND WE'RE

1941
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:23,253
WATCHING SCENES OF THE STUDENTS 

1942
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:23,820
COMING OUT.

1943
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,221
LOOK AT THOSE STUDENTS, GEORGE.

1944
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,256
THEY ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1945
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:28,291
THEY EITHER PUT UP THEIR HANDS 

1946
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,093
IN THE AIR, THEY TOUCH ONE 

1947
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,494
ANOTHER.

1948
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,829
THEY FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT.

1949
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,231
THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD SAY 

1950
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,966
EVERY ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS HAS 

1951
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:41,070
SEEN BEFORE IN THEIR LIFETIME 

1952
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,940
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

1953
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:49,045
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TRAINED, YOU 

1954
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:52,315
HAVE TO PUT ALL THOSE LESSONS TO

1955
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:52,515
BEAR. 

1956
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,683
>> THERE HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF A

1957
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,151
DRILL EARLIER IN THE DAY.

1958
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,953
TOM LLAMAS, YOU'VE BEEN IN TOUCH

1959
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,354
WITH SOURCES DOWN IN FLORIDA?

1960
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,522
>> YEAH.

1961
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,723
PROMISING NEWS AND VERY SAD 

1962
00:56:00,723 --> 00:56:01,925
NEWS.

1963
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,827
FIRST THE PROMISING NEWS.

1964
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,930
WPLG, OUR AFFILIATE IN MIAMI, IS

1965
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,564
REPORTING THAT THE GUNMAN HAS 

1966
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:08,298
BEEN ARRESTED.

1967
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,866
THE AERIAL SHOT THAT WE HAD OF 

1968
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:12,769
THE PERSON IN THE BURGUNDY SHOT 

1969
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,837
WAS INDEED THE GUNMAN.

1970
00:56:14,837 --> 00:56:16,172
THIS IS PRELIMINARY IN THE 

1971
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:16,872
INVESTIGATION BUT THIS IS WHAT 

1972
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:18,875
OUR LOCAL AFFILIATE IS BEING 

1973
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,075
TOLD.

1974
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,076
THAT BEING SAID, SEVERAL 

1975
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,277
STUDENTS FROM THE SCHOOL ARE NOW

1976
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,545
TWEETING THAT THEY'RE BEING LED 

1977
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,113
OUT OF THE SCHOOL, THAT THEY ARE

1978
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:24,313
OKAY.

1979
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:26,115
THAT BEING SAID, SENATOR BILL 

1980
00:56:26,115 --> 00:56:29,085
NELSON HAS REPORTEDLY SAID THERE

1981
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,620
ARE MANY DEATHS IN THIS CASE, 

1982
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,053
MANY FATALITIES.

1983
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:33,222
>> THAT'S COMING FROM FLORIDA 

1984
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:34,657
SENATOR BILL NELSON RIGHT NOW.

1985
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,292
WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER POLICE 

1986
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,894
THAT ONE PERSON CONFIRMED DEAD 

1987
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,530
FROM AN EYE WITNESS ON THE 

1988
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:40,730
SCENE.

1989
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,534
AT LEAST TWO OTHERS DEDAD AND W 

1990
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,301
KNOW UP TO 20 INJURED. 

1991
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:49,238
>> THERE ARE LOCAL MEDIA REPORTS

1992
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:51,007
THAT WE ARE WORKING TO CONFIRM 

1993
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,308
THAT THAT PERSON YOU SAW IN 

1994
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:53,843
CUSTODY THERE WHO LOOKS TO BE A 

1995
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,945
YOUNG PERSON WAS A STUDENT 

1996
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,580
POSSIBLY AT ONE OF THE TWO 

1997
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,415
SCHOOLS THAT ARE NEXT TO EACH 

1998
00:56:59,415 --> 00:56:59,615
OTHER.

1999
00:56:59,615 --> 00:57:00,683
IF THAT WERE TO BE THE CASE, 

2000
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,151
THAT WOULD STAND TO REASON WHY 

2001
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:04,287
IT WOULD BE SO DIFFICULT FOR 

2002
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,689
POLICE TO FIND THIS KID SO 

2003
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:06,922
QUICKLY.

2004
00:57:06,922 --> 00:57:10,393
LIKE WE SAID, POSSIBLY 4500 

2005
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:10,660
STUDENTS. 

2006
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,794
>> THE BROWARD SHERIFF IS 

2007
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:13,329
CONFIRMING THAT THE SHOOTER IS 

2008
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:13,763
IN CUSTODY.

2009
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,065
WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE SHOOTER IN

2010
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,266
THE BURGUNDY SHIRT, SO THIS IS 

2011
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:18,667
NO LONGER AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

2012
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:21,104
SITUATION IN SOUTH FLORIDA, BUT 

2013
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,138
TOM LLAMAS, IT IS A MASS 

2014
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:22,505
CASUALTY EVENT.

2015
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,641
IT IS A SERIOUS ONE.

2016
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:25,975
>> YEAH, FROM THE SOURCES THAT 

2017
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,077
WE'VE HEARD AND WE'VE CONFIRMED 

2018
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,512
THIS WITH THREE DIFFERENT 

2019
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:31,080
SOURCES, THERE ARE AT LEAST 20 

2020
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,216
INJURIES, AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE 

2021
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:33,850
HURT.

2022
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,251
FROM SENATOR BILL NELSON WE KNOW

2023
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,553
THERE ARE, QUOTE, MANY DEATHS, 

2024
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:38,755
MANY FATALITIES.

2025
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,156
HE WAS BRIEFED BY THE 

2026
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:40,790
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE BROWARD 

2027
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,358
COUNTY SCHOOLS.

2028
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,392
THAT'S A HORRIBLE PIECE OF NEWS 

2029
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:45,494
RIGHT THERE, ESPECIALLY FOR SO 

2030
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:46,662
MANY PARENTS THAT ARE HOME AND 

2031
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:48,665
WERE TOLD DON'T CALL 911 BECAUSE

2032
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,366
THE LINES WERE SO JAMMED BECAUSE

2033
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,033
SO MANY PARENTS WERE CONCERNED 

2034
00:57:51,033 --> 00:57:52,301
ABOUT THEIR KIDS LIKE ANY PARENT

2035
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:53,369
WOULD BE.

2036
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,704
THEY WERE TOLD TO STAY THERE AND

2037
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:55,771
WAIT FOR THEIR CHILD TO LEAVE 

2038
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:56,272
THE SCHOOL.

2039
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,807
YOU'RE A PARENT, I'M A PARENT.

2040
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,509
THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. 

2041
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,744
>> RAY KELLY, FORMER NEW YORK 

2042
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,447
CITY POLICE CHIEF, THE SHOOTER 

2043
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:04,814
NOW IN CUSTODY.

2044
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,581
WE SEE THAT PICTURE RIGHT THERE 

2045
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:05,748
NOW.

2046
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:06,382
THE POLICE HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE

2047
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,452
OUT WHY.

2048
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:10,152
>> YEAH.

2049
00:58:10,152 --> 00:58:12,154
I WOULD BET THERE'S AN ELEMENT 

2050
00:58:12,154 --> 00:58:13,923
OF BULLYING INVOLVED HERE.

2051
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:24,500
WE'VE SEEN IT IN SO MANY CASES.

2052
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,000
SOM

2053
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,069
THEY THINK ABOUT IT, PLAN IT FOR

2054
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,236
MONTHS AND THEY ACT OUT.

2055
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,804
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT I'M 

2056
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:29,705
PRETTY SURE THERE'S AN ELEMENT 

2057
00:58:29,705 --> 00:58:30,640
OF THAT HERE.

2058
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,274
>> RIGHT.

2059
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,342
BRAD GARRETT, WE'VE SEEN THIS 

2060
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:37,413
ALSO FROM SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THAT 

2061
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,849
HAVE BEEN THWARTED, AN ELEMENT 

2062
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,385
OF PLANNING, AS YOU SAY, 

2063
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,021
BUILDING UP RESENTMENT FOR 

2064
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,456
WEEKS, MAYBE MONTHS, PUTTING THE

2065
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,024
PLAN TOGETHER AND ONE DAY 

2066
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,959
SOMETHING SNAPS.

2067
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,761
SOMETHING SNAPS, BUT HERE'S WHAT

2068
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,730
HAPPENED, GEORGE.

2069
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,431
HE HAS TOLD KIDS MAYBE NOT THAT 

2070
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,901
HE WAS GOING TO COMMIT A MASS 

2071
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,802
SHOOTING AT SCHOOL, BUT HIS 

2072
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,405
ANGER, RAGE, DARKNESS, MAYBE 

2073
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,605
FOCUS ON PARTICULAR STUDENTS OR 

2074
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:05,041
GROUPS WITHIN THE SCHOOL ARE 

2075
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:05,641
GOING TO BE OUT THERE.

2076
00:59:05,641 --> 00:59:07,543
THESE ARE TEENAGERS.

2077
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:08,477
THEY TALK THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, 

2078
00:59:08,477 --> 00:59:09,779
TEXT EACH OTHER.

2079
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:10,647
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE.

2080
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,114
THAT'S ALL GOING TO BREAK DOWN 

2081
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:14,617
AT SOME POINT AS TO WHAT EXACTLY

2082
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,319
DID THIS KID SAY TO OTHERS 

2083
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,521
BEFORE THE SHOOTING OCCURRED.

2084
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,322
AS YOU AND I TALKED A FEW 

2085
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:21,657
MINUTES AGO, WHAT'S HIS ACCESS 

2086
00:59:21,657 --> 00:59:22,258
TO WEAPONS?

2087
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:24,027
HOW DID HE GET THE WEAPON OR 

2088
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,596
WEAPONS THAT HE HAD TODAY?

2089
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,597
IT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION IN 

2090
00:59:28,597 --> 00:59:30,800
EVERY ONE OF THESE SHOOTERS AND 

2091
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,402
IT'S USUALLY THE ANSWER, THEY'RE

2092
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,337
READILY AVAILABLE AT HOME. 

2093
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:38,975
>> AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN THERE 

2094
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:43,980
HAVE BEEN SO MANY LOOPHOLES THAT

2095
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,214
SO MANY PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T 

2096
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,983
HAVE GUNS ARE ABLE TO BUY THEM.

2097
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,918
IT DOES APPEAR, NOW THAT IT'S NO

2098
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,586
LONGER AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

2099
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:52,888
SITUATION, THAT THE SHOOTER DID 

2100
00:59:52,888 --> 00:59:53,890
ACT ALONE.

2101
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,825
BEFORE WE GO BACK TO YOU, BRAD, 

2102
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,159
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE 

2103
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:58,060
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LOCAL 

2104
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,195
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

2105
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,230
LET'S LISTEN IN TO WPLG. 

2106
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,497
>> SUPERINTENDENT, I KNOW THIS 

2107
01:00:02,497 --> 01:00:04,967
HAS TO BE JUST A HORRIBLE DAY, A

2108
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:06,469
NIGHTMARE FOR EVERYBODY.

2109
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:11,374
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW AT THIS 

2110
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:11,607
POINT. 

2111
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,877
>> FIRST, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING 

2112
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:19,315
OTHER THAN PUT OUR PRAYERS OUT 

2113
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,484
FOR THE FAMILIES, THE STUDENTS 

2114
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,419
IN THE SCHOOL AND THIS 

2115
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:23,686
COMMUNITY.

2116
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,254
IT'S A HEARTBREAKING TRAGEDY.

2117
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,856
WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT IS 

2118
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:30,827
THAT EVERY SINGLE LAW 

2119
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:31,928
ENFORCEMENT ENTITY IN BROWARD 

2120
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:36,065
COUNTY IS ON THE SCENE INCLUDING

2121
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:37,467
THE FBI.

2122
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,701
THERE ARE FATALITIES INVOLVED.

2123
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:39,935
WE CAN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER AT 

2124
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:40,336
THIS POINT.

2125
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:41,637
I AM IN COMMUNICATION WITH 

2126
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:42,538
SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL.

2127
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,507
I'M GOING TO MEET WITH HIM NOW.

2128
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,475
I'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH 

2129
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:47,376
THE GOVERNOR.

2130
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:52,281
EVERYONE IS PROVIDING THE FULL 

2131
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,950
SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN.

2132
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:58,921
THERE ARE CNOT CONFIRMED REPORT 

2133
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,822
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE SHOOTER 

2134
01:01:00,822 --> 01:01:02,525
HAS BEEN APPREHENDED AND WE'RE 

2135
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,226
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE 

2136
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:04,861
DETAILS AT THIS POINT. 

2137
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,729
>> THE SCENARIO WE'RE HEARING IS

2138
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,299
THIS FORMER STUDENT ENTERED THE 

2139
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:10,699
FRESHMAN BUILDING.

2140
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:13,269
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING?

2141
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:13,903
>> I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF 

2142
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,104
WHERE THE STUDENT ENTERED BUT WE

2143
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,173
DO KNOW THAT IT OCCURRED DURING 

2144
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:17,807
DISMISSAL TIME.

2145
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:20,543
AND YES, IT POTENTIALLY IS SOME 

2146
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:21,210
FORMER STUDENT.

2147
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,779
I DON'T HAVE A NAME YET.

2148
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,914
I CAN'T RELEASE ANY INFORMATION 

2149
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:25,214
TO YOU.

2150
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:30,119
THAT INDIVIDUAL WE BELIEVE IS IN

2151
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:30,386
CUSTODY. 

2152
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,922
>> WE HEAR A HIGH NUMBER OF 

2153
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:33,222
CASUALTIES.

2154
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,891
DO YOU KNOW JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE

2155
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:35,792
MAY HAVE DIED?

2156
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,726
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER AT

2157
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:39,061
THIS POINT BUT THERE ARE 

2158
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:39,862
FATALITIES INVOLVED HERE. 

2159
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,864
>> CAN YOU TELL US AT LEAST HOW 

2160
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,265
MANY TRANSPORTS, DO YOU KNOW, 

2161
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:44,500
MAYBE A DOZEN?

2162
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,334
>> I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER 

2163
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,271
THAT'S BEEN TRANSPORTED AT THIS 

2164
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,038
POINT.

2165
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:59,916
AGAIN, THERE ARE NUMEROUS 

2166
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:00,216
FATALITIES.

2167
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:00,750
IT'S A HORRIFIC SITUATION.

2168
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,350
IT'S A HORRIBLE DAY FOR US. 

2169
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,320
>> WE GOT REPORTS OF MULTIPLE 

2170
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:04,920
SHOO

2171
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,187
SHOOTINGS.

2172
01:02:05,187 --> 01:02:07,390
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?

2173
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,824
>> AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NO 

2174
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:09,926
EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S BEEN MORE 

2175
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,128
THAN ONE SHOOTER.

2176
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,431
THE INDIVIDUAL, AGAIN, WE 

2177
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:16,032
BELIEVE HAS BEEN APPREHENDED.

2178
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:16,966
I WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE SHERIFF 

2179
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:18,033
TO PROVIDE YOU ADDITIONAL 

2180
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:24,941
DETAILS AROUND THAT.

2181
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,742
>> WE HEARD THAT A TEACHER HAD 

2182
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:27,443
BEEN SHOT.

2183
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,278
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?

2184
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:30,312
>> I BELIEVE THERE'S AN 

2185
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:31,547
ADMINISTRATOR OR TEACHER THAT'S 

2186
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:31,814
INVOLVED.

2187
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,583
THERE MAY BE MORE.

2188
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,985
I CAN'T CONFIRM IF THAT'S BEEN 

2189
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,053
ONE OF THE FATALITIES AT THE 

2190
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:37,286
MOMENT. 

2191
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,221
>> THIS IS A DAY I'M SURE EVERY 

2192
01:02:39,221 --> 01:02:40,589
SUPERINTENDENT FEARS, AND TO 

2193
01:02:40,589 --> 01:02:43,859
HAPPEN HERE IN BROWARD. 

2194
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:46,995
>> IT'S A DAY THAT YOU PRAY 

2195
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:49,932
EVERY DAY I GET UP THAT WE WILL 

2196
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:53,202
NEVER HAVE TO SEE.

2197
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,338
IT IS IN FRONT OF US AND I ASK 

2198
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,841
THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR PRAYERS,

2199
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:02,345
YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE CHILDREN 

2200
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,145
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

2201
01:03:03,145 --> 01:03:04,613
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER WE 

2202
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:05,881
CAN TO COME TOGETHER AS A 

2203
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:09,518
COMMUNITY TO PULL THROUGH THIS, 

2204
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:10,152
AND WE WILL.

2205
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:14,289
AGAIN, WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE

2206
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:18,728
POSSIBLY CAN.

2207
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:19,996
STUDENTS ARE BEING EVACUATED AND

2208
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,030
RELEASED AT THE MOMENT AND WE'RE

2209
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:21,897
WORKING THROUGH THAT PROCESS 

2210
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:22,398
RIGHT NOW. 

2211
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,799
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY 

2212
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:25,868
INDICATION, ANY WARNING, ANY 

2213
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,770
HINT THAT THIS STUDENT COULD 

2214
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,938
HAVE BEEN PLANNING THIS?

2215
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,240
>> WE RECEIVED NO WARNING, NO 

2216
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,641
INDICATION, BUT AGAIN, THERE'S 

2217
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:36,245
GOING TO BE A THOROUGH 

2218
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,980
INVEST

2219
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:39,548
INVESTIGATION.

2220
01:03:39,548 --> 01:03:41,717
TYPICALLY YOU SEE IN THESE 

2221
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:42,384
SITUATIONS THAT THERE COULD HAVE

2222
01:03:42,384 --> 01:03:43,352
BEEN SIGNS OUT THERE.

2223
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,386
I WOULD BE SPECULATING AT THIS 

2224
01:03:44,386 --> 01:03:45,288
POINT IF THERE WERE.

2225
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,889
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WARNINGS.

2226
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:47,924
THERE WEREN'T ANY PHONE CALLS OR

2227
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,258
THREATS THAT WE KNOW OF THAT 

2228
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:49,558
WERE MADE. 

2229
01:03:49,558 --> 01:03:53,262
>> SUPERINTENDENT, THERE'S SO 

2230
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:55,230
MANY PARENTS THAT ARE AFRAID TO 

2231
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,300
TAKE THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL.

2232
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,403
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM OUT 

2233
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:00,603
THERE?

2234
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,805
>> WE CANNOT LIVE IN A WORLD 

2235
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:05,641
THAT'S BUILT ON FEAR.

2236
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:10,980
WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO 

2237
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:11,614
MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE 

2238
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:12,481
GREATEST SAFETY MEASURES WE CAN 

2239
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,983
FOR OUR KIDS.

2240
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:17,453
WHAT I'LL TELL YOU IS THAT 

2241
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,455
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- 

2242
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,522

THE SCENE OF A MASS CASUALTY 

2248
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:33,936
SHOOTING.

2249
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,804
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY, WE 

2250
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:36,305
ARE TOLD.

2251
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,374
THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT

2252
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,909
SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN.

2253
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:43,078
I'M JOINED FROM WASHINGTON BY 

2254
01:04:43,078 --> 01:04:44,546
CONGRESSMAN TED DEUTSCH,

CONGRESSMAN FROM PARKLAND.

2256
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:47,249
PARKLAND IS INSIDE YOUR 

2257
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:47,650
DISTRICT.

2258
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,851
WE'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS 

2259
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,120
RIGHT NOW, A MASS CASUALTY 

2260
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:51,320
EVENT.

2261
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,624
FIRST OF ALL, OUR CONDOLENCES TO

2262
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:57,193
YOU AND ALL THE VICTIMS IN YOUR 

2263
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:57,460
DISTRICT.

2264
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,462
WE'VE HEARD THE SHOOTER IS IN 

2265
01:04:59,462 --> 01:04:59,929
CUSTODY.

2266
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:00,997
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US?

2267
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,666
>> THIS IS A REALLY TRAGIC DAY, 

2268
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,969
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE OCCURRENCE.

2269
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,304
I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THE SHOOTER

2270
01:05:09,304 --> 01:05:10,172
IS IN CUSTODY.

2271
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:15,611
IF TRUE, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOOD 

2272
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:16,112
NEWS.

2273
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:16,746
NOW FROM THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE 

2274
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:17,880
HAD WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT AND 

2275
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,282
THE MAYOR AND SHERIFF ISRAEL, WE

2276
01:05:20,282 --> 01:05:25,821
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF 

2277
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:29,558
THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL WHO CAN 

2278
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,060
GET OUT SAFELY ARE TENDED TO 

2279
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,094
QUICKLY AND THAT THE COMMUNITY 

2280
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:32,762
COME TOGETHER.

2281
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,497
WE DON'T HAVE REPORTS ON THE 

2282
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:38,034
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES HERE BUT 

2283
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:42,938
IT'S A GRIM DAY.

2284
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,040
THIS IS A FANTASTIC SCHOOL.

2285
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,607
THE KIDS ARE GREAT.

2286
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:54,183
I WAS THERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

2287
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,451
THIS IS THE WORST TRAGEDY AND WE

2288
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,720
HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A 

2289
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,755
COMMUNITY WHICH I KNOW WE WILL.

2290
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:00,789
THAT'S THE KIND OF COMMUNITY 

2291
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:02,525
THIS IS BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

2292
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,126
THAT THAT WAS INDEED THE SHOOTER

2293
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,794
AND WE'VE GOT TO TEND TO THOSE 

2294
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,696
WHO NEED CARE.

2295
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:09,331
FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE LOST,

2296
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:11,100
WE HAVE TO BE THERE FOR THE 

2297
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,301
FAMILIES WHO ARE GRIEVING. 

2298
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,236
>> WE HEAR THAT SO OFTEN FROM 

2299
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,304
THOSE ON THE SCENE IN THE HOURS 

2300
01:06:16,304 --> 01:06:17,673
AND DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING.

2301
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:18,808
THE COMMUNITY HAS TO COME 

2302
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,075
TOGETHER.

2303
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,609
THE COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER, 

2304
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,944
THEY GRIEVE, AND THEN WE HEAR IT

2305
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:23,512
AGAIN IN ANOTHER SCHOOL IN 

2306
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:26,015
ANOTHER CITY.

2307
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,850
>> RIGHT.

2308
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:32,121
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I WAS IN A

2309
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:35,324
HEARING WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND 

2310
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,126
STARTED GETTING TEXTS FROM A 

2311
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,727
STAFFER OF MINE WHOSE DAUGHTER 

2312
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:45,000
WAS IN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL ON 

2313
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,533
LOC

2314
01:06:45,533 --> 01:06:45,800
LOCKDOWN.

2315
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,703
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE 

2316
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:48,604
FOOTAGE UNTIL I WAS STANDING 

2317
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,840
HERE WAITING TO COME ON WITH 

2318
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,574
YOU.

2319
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:55,310
WHAT IS SO TERRIBLE IS THE FACT 

2320
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:57,813
THAT WHEN YOU WATCH THE VIDEO OF

2321
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:01,617
KIDS RUNNING OUT OF SCHOOL WITH 

2322
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,918
THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR AND YOU 

2323
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,620
SEE THE INTERVIEWS AND YOU SEE 

2324
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,089
LAW ENFORCEMENT GOING IN, WHAT'S

2325
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:10,793
SO TERRIBLE IS THAT IT'S SO 

2326
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:11,260
COMMON.

2327
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,695
THAT'S THE TRULY AWFUL PART OF 

2328
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:12,895
THIS.

2329
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,096
YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DO HAVE TO COME

2330
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:18,033
TOGETHER AND THE COMMUNITY WILL.

2331
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:19,368
MY COLLEAGUES IN CONGRESS HAVE 

2332
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,702
BEEN INCREDIBLE ABOUT OFFERING 

2333
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:24,539
THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR 

2334
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:25,674
ENCOURAGEMENT AND CONDOLENCES 

2335
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:29,711
BUT BEYOND THAT THERE IS AN 

2336
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:30,679
OBLIGATION FOR EVERYONE TO DO 

2337
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,715
THEIR PART GOING FORWARD TO TRY 

2338
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:38,020
TO PREVENT MORE SHOOTINGS LIKE 

2339
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:38,454
THIS.

2340
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,923
WHAT'S SO AWFUL IS HOW COMMON 

2341
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,892
THIS HAS BECOME, AND WE CAN'T BE

2342
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,326
NUMB TO IT AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE

2343
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,396
TO WAIT UNTIL IT'S IN YOUR

01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,097
DISTRICT TO RESPOND.

2345
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,266

NEAR THE SCHOOL AND THEY'RE 

2379
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:46,087

BY LIZETTE ROSEENBLAT.

2387
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,305
YOUR DAUGHTER IS IN THE SCHOOL?

2388
01:09:04,305 --> 01:09:06,442
>> SHE CALLED ME ABOUT A 

2389
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:09,612
HALF-HOUR OR 45 MINUTES AGO THAT

2390
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,881
SHE'S OUT, THANK GOD.

2391
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:15,050
THERE WERE 20 OR 30 MINUTES 

2392
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,486
WHERE I DIDN'T HEAR FROM HER 

2393
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,821
WHICH WAS NERVE RACKING.

2394
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:21,156
OUR NEIGHBOR IS STILL INSIDE. 

2395
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:23,292
>> STILL INSIDE THE SCHOOL?

2396
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,694
>> AS OF 4:02 P.M. SHE WAS 

2397
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,863
TELLING ME I THINK WE'RE BEING 

2398
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:30,032
EVACUATED SOON BUT THAT'S WHAT I

2399
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:31,500
THOUGHT 45 MINUTES AGO.

2400
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,835
I'M IN ROOM 22.

2401
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,203
WE HEARD THE FIRE ALARM.

2402
01:09:35,203 --> 01:09:35,870
WE WERE EVACUATED AT FIRST BUT 

2403
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:38,073
WE SAW THE POLICE RUNNING WITH 

2404
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,175
GUNS AND GUNSHOTS AND PEOPLE 

2405
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:42,678
WERE SCREAMING SO WE RAN BACK 

2406
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:43,245
INSIDE.

2407
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,046
THAT'S FROM MY NEIGHBOR WHO IS 

2408
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:45,212
15. 

2409
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:45,981
>> WHAT MORE WERE YOU ABLE TO 

2410
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,216
LEARN FROM YOUR DAUGHTER?

2411
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,716
>> MY DAUGHTER TEXTED US, I 

2412
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:51,886
DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TIMES 

2413
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:56,158
ANYMORE, SOME TIME AROUND 2:30.

2414
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,594
I URN FORNFORTUNATELY MISSED TH 

2415
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,162
AND THE TEXT AND SHE TEXTED MY 

2416
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:02,898
HUSBAND WHO WAS HOME THANK 

2417
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:03,165
GOODNESS.

2418
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:03,799
SHE SAID THERE WAS A SHOOTER IN 

2419
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:04,133
THE SCHOOL.

2420
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,500
HE TOLD HER TO REMAIN CALM AND 

2421
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,902
EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE FINE.

2422
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,437
HE HUNG UP WITH HER AND CALLED 

2423
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,205
THE SCHOOL TO VERIFY.

2424
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:11,940
IT WAS CONFIRMED AND HE TOOK OFF

2425
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,142
IN HIS CAR.

2426
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,310
OBVIOUSLY HE COULDN'T GET TO THE

2427
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,677
SCHOOL BUT IN THE AREA.

2428
01:10:15,677 --> 01:10:17,346
HE PARKED BY A GAS STATION AND 

2429
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,615
STARTED WALKING OVER THERE.

2430
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,483
SHE IN THE MEANTIME WAS TEXTING 

2431
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:21,950
ME.

2432
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,685
SHE WAS TELLING ME -- SHE SAID 

2433
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:25,688
SHE WAS FINE, THAT SHE WAS 

2434
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,988
HIDING AND SHE KEPT BEGGING ME 

2435
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:28,090
TO PLEASE CALL THE POLICE 

2436
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,825
BECAUSE SHE WAS HEARING SOMEBODY

2437
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:31,327
CRYING OUT FOR HELP.

2438
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,194
SHE SAID SHE WAS -- SHE COULD 

2439
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:34,029
HEAR THE PERSON.

2440
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:37,533
WHEN I FINALLY SPOKE TO HER, SHE

2441
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:38,567
ACTUALLY CALLED ME AND SAID IT 

2442
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,435
WAS A SPANISH SPEAKING STUDENT 

2443
01:10:40,435 --> 01:10:42,705
AND HE WAS JUST CRYING AND SHE 

2444
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,273
COULD HEAR THAT CALLING OUT.

2445
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,641
SHE WAS SO WORRIED.

2446
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:49,411
ALL I COULD SAY -- I TEXTED HER 

2447
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,612
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

2448
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:52,448
I PROMISE YOU I'LL CALL THE 

2449
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:53,749
POLICE, JUST KEEP HIDING.

2450
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,950
I DID CALL 911.

2451
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,919
I GAVE THEM THE DETAILS THAT I 

2452
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:57,619
HAD.

2453
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:59,187
THAT WAS AT 2:48 IN THE 

2454
01:10:59,187 --> 01:10:59,688
AFTERNOON.

2455
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,790
I DIDN'T HEAR FROM HER AGAIN FOR

2456
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,991
ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES AND IT 

2457
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:04,059
WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING 

2458
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:06,895
BECAUSE HER FRIENDS GOT OUT.

2459
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:09,732
I KEPT GETTING CALLS FROM 

2460
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:10,665
PARENTS OF FRIENDS OF HERS 

2461
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:12,601
ASKING ME IF I HAD MY DAUGHTER 

2462
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,769
AND I DIDN'T.

2463
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,137
I HADN'T EVEN HEARD FROM HER.

2464
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:16,905
I KEPT TEXTING WHERE ARE YOU AND

2465
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:17,772
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE. 

2466
01:11:17,772 --> 01:11:19,408
>> THAT HAD TO BE THE LONGEST 30

2467
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:20,042
MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE. 

2468
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,310
>> IT WAS HORRIBLE.

2469
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,045
WHEN SHE FINALLY CALLED ME THAT 

2470
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,780
SHE WAS OKAY, AT THAT POINT MY 

2471
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,814
OLDEST DAUGHTER HAD TAKEN OFF TO

2472
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,382
GO GET MY HUSBAND WHO WAS NOT 

2473
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:29,685
ALLOWED TO GET BACK TO HIS CAR I

2474
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,587
THINK JUST BECAUSE IT'S TOTAL 

2475
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,321
MADNESS IN PARKLAND RIGHT NOW, 

2476
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:34,156
ALL THE S.W.A.T. AND THE POLICE 

2477
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:34,890
AND EVERYTHING.

2478
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:35,858
THEY JUST COULDN'T GET BACK TO 

2479
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:36,425
WHERE THEY WERE.

2480
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,860
SO I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THEY 

2481
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,895
WERE BOTH GOING TO TALK WITH MY 

2482
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:42,297
DAUGHTER, AND THEN I GET A TEXT 

2483
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,933
FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S DAUGHTER 

2484
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:45,967
SAYING THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT 

2485
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:48,169
WITH THEM AND THAT SHE HAD 

2486
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:50,005
WALKED TO ANOTHER FRIEND'S HOUSE

2487
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,907
THE COMPLETELY OPPOSITE 

2488
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:52,174
DIRECTION.

2489
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,042
SO ABOUT 10, 15 MINUTES AGO I 

2490
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,744
GET A PHONE CALL FROM MY 

2491
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,479
DAUGHTER SAYING SHE'S AT HER 

2492
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,415
FRIEND'S HOUSE ALONE HIDING.

2493
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:03,752
I'M LIKE WHY ARE YOU ALONE AND 

2494
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:03,985
HIDING.

2495
01:12:03,985 --> 01:12:04,619
AT THAT POINT SHE DIDN'T KNOW 

2496
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:05,620
THAT THE SHOOTER HAD BEEN 

2497
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,088
CAUGHT.

2498
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,290
HER FRIEND FOR SOME REASON WAS 

2499
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:09,024
SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THANKFULLY 

2500
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,859
THE MOM GAVE HER THE GATE CODE 

2501
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,694
OR THE GARAGE CODE TO GET IN.

2502
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,363
MY DAUGHTER IS CURRENTLY IN 

2503
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:14,763
SOMEONE'S HOME.

2504
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:18,166
I MEAN IT'S A FRIEND'S HOME BUT 

2505
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,234
SHE'S IN THERE AND SHE WAS 

2506
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:20,102
PETRIFIED, STILL BY HERSELF.

2507
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,336
I CALLED HER AND I SAID THE 

2508
01:12:21,336 --> 01:12:22,738
SHOOTER HAS BEEN CAUGHT.

2509
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:23,372
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

2510
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,307
I'M LIKE, I PROMISE YOU.

2511
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,776
ALL THESE KIDS THAT ARE OUT, 

2512
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:29,011
THEY'RE STILL ABSOLUTELY 

2513
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:29,278
TERRIFIED.

2514
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,111
THEY DON'T HAVE INFORMATION, 

2515
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:31,279
ESPECIALLY HER FRIEND THAT'S 

2516
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:33,081
INSIDE THE BUILDING.

2517
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:34,383
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

2518
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,285
SO I JUST TEXTED THE GIRL THAT'S

2519
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,419
STILL INSIDE, LIKE DON'T WORRY, 

2520
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:38,487
THE SHOOTER HAS BEEN CAUGHT.

2521
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:42,958
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HOME SAFE 

2522
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:43,158
SOON.

2523
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:47,196
HOPEFULLY NOW THAT THE SHOOTER 

2524
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,264
HAS BEEN APPAPPREHENDED, THE KI 

2525
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:50,365
CAN START MAKING THEIR WAY HOME.

2526
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:51,900
>> AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HUG 

2527
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,267
YOUR DAUGHTER. 

2528
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:53,402
>> I CAN'T WAIT.

2529
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:54,569
YOU NEVER THINK SOMETHING LIKE 

2530
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,638
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN YOUR 

2531
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,006
NEIGHBORHOOD.

2532
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,275
WE WERE VOTED ONE OF THE SAFEST 

2533
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:01,777
CITIES YESTERDAY I THINK I READ 

2534
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,178
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THEN 

2535
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:04,112
TODAY HERE WE ARE.

2536
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:06,348
IT'S A SCARY SITUATION.

2537
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:07,416
IT'S ALL ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND 

2538
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,317
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

2539
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,317
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING 

2540
01:13:09,317 --> 01:13:09,784
TO HAPPEN. 

2541
01:13:09,784 --> 01:13:11,353
>> ONE MORE REMINDER THAT NO 

2542
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:12,654
PLACE IS SAFE.

2543
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,056
WE'RE GLAD YOUR DAUGHTER IS 

2544
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:14,256
SAFE.

2545
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,657
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME THIS 

2546
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:15,924
AFTERNOON.

2547
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:18,527
I WANT TO BRING IN SENATOR BILL 

2548

YOUR STATE RIGHT NOW.

2552
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,134
PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU CAN AND 

2553
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:27,336
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 

2554
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:27,603
SHOOTING. 

2555
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:30,672
>> GEORGE, IT'S A BAD DAY.

2556
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,976
A NUMBER OF FATALITIES.

2557
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:39,147
I WAS TOLD THAT BY THE SCHOOL 

2558
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:40,315
SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO

2559
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,184
AND SUBSEQUENTLY I'VE JUST HEARD

2560
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:47,656
HIM IN A LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE 

2561
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:51,493
SAY THE SAME THING PUBLICLY.

2562
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,930
AS TO THE NUMBER, I DON'T KNOW.

2563
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:59,268
HE IMPLIED THAT IT WAS QUITE A 

2564
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:05,073
NUMBER, BUT LET'S HOPE IT'S NOT.

2565
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,909
IF YOU PRAY, YOU OUGHT TO PRAY 

2566
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:09,144
FOR THESE STUDENTS AND THEIR 

2567
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,546
SCHOOL AND THEIR PARENTS RIGHT 

2568
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:10,779
NOW.

2569
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,281
CERTAINLY OUR THOUGHTS GO OUT TO

2570
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:12,481
THEM. 

2571
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:13,782
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE 

2572
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,783
BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFFS THAT 

2573
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,418
THERE ARE AT LEAST 14 VICTIMS 

2574
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,253
RIGHT NOW BUT WE BELIEVE THE 

2575
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,088
SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.

2576
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,156
THAT'S ALSO BEEN REPORTED.

2577
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:22,424
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT 

2578
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:23,258
THE SHOOTER?

2579
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:24,960
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY 

2580
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,260
INFORMATION?

2581
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:29,264
>> IT IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

2582
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,967
SITUATION STILL BECAUSE THEY ARE

2583
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,668
CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE WAS A 

2584
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:35,236
SECOND OR THIRD SHOOTER.

2585
01:14:35,236 --> 01:14:36,671
WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION 

2586
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,074
THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE 

2587
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,576
SINCE THE SUSPECT, THEY THINK 

2588
01:14:41,576 --> 01:14:42,077
THEY HAVE HIM.

2589
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:45,781
THE FBI IS LEADING THE EFFORT 

2590
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:49,951
AND THEN OF COURSE THE 

2591
01:14:49,951 --> 01:14:50,285
INVESTIGATION.

2592
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:50,785
THE FBI WILL LEAD THE 

2593
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:51,886
INVESTIGATION WITH ALL OF LOCAL 

2594
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:52,621
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

2595
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:53,888
>> SENATOR, WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST 

2596
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:56,592
THOUGHTS WHEN IT HITS HOME LIKE 

2597
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:56,858
THIS?

2598
01:14:56,858 --> 01:15:00,195
>> IT'S A BAD DAY.

2599
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:02,698
ONCE WE GET INTO THE 

2600
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,266
INVESTIGATION, HOW DID HE 

2601
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:07,703
ACQUIRE THE WEAPON, WAS IT HIGH 

2602
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:08,203
CAL

2603
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:11,439
CALIBER, WAS IT SOMETHING THAT 

2604
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:15,243
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

2605
01:15:15,243 --> 01:15:15,543
B

2606
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:17,645
BUY, WAS THERE A BACKGROUND 

2607
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:17,946
CHECK.

2608
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,481
ALL THE THINGS THAT WHEN WE HEAR

2609
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,517
ABOUT THESE MASS SHOOTINGS WE 

2610
01:15:22,517 --> 01:15:25,920
WONDER ABOUT AND IT'S HARD TO 

2611
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,590
EVEN GET SOMETHING PUT INTO LAW 

2612
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:33,328
LIKE THE ACTIVE TERRORIST WATCH 

2613
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:36,264
LIST FROM BEING PREVENTED TO BUY

2614
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:37,432
A GUN.

2615
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:38,467
AGAIN, WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER ROUND 

2616
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,268
OF ALL OF THIS DEBATE THAT THIS 

2617
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:42,437
BRINGS TO MIND.

2618
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:45,173
>> SENATOR, THE ROUNDS HAVE 

2619
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,908
BECOME ALMOST RITUALISTIC.

2620
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:49,344
WE GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS, DO 

2621
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,280
THE INVESTIGATIONS, GRIEVE FOR 

2622
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,482
THE VICTIMS, MOURN FOR THE 

2623
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:53,915
FA

2624
01:15:53,915 --> 01:15:55,217
FAMILIES, AND IT HAPPENS AGAIN. 

2625
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,919
>> GEORGE, YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

2626
01:15:57,919 --> 01:16:00,255
WE KEEP SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 

2627
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:06,661
BUT THEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN. 

2628
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:08,497
>> SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

2629
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:08,797
TIME TODAY.

2630
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:11,033
YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

2631
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,667
I'M HERE WITH TOM LLAMAS AS WELL

2632
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:14,736
AS WE'RE STILL SEEING THOSE 

2633
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,872
SCENES AS THEY UNFOLDED EARLIER 

2634
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:19,541
THIS AFTERNOON.

2635
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,608
THE BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF 

2636
01:16:20,608 --> 01:16:23,744
REPORTS THERE ARE 14 VICTIMS.

2637
01:16:23,744 --> 01:16:25,246
WE DO BELIEVE THE SHOOTER IS IN 

2638
01:16:25,246 --> 01:16:28,450
CUSTODY ALTHOUGH AS THE SENATOR 

2639
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,151
POINTS OUT, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

2640
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,351
SAY THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVE 

2641
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:31,386
SHOOTER SITUATION UNTIL THEY GO 

2642
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,587
THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN THAT 

2643
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:32,820
SCHOOL. 

2644
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,022
>> POLICE ARE TELLING US THEY'RE

2645
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:34,923
GOING ROOM BY ROOM.

2646
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,091
IT'S A MASSIVE SCHOOL.

2647
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,426
AS ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS TOLD 

2648
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,460
YOU, THEY'RE GOING ROOM BY ROOM 

2649
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,196
TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER 

2650
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:42,897
POTENTIAL SHOOTERS.

2651
01:16:42,897 --> 01:16:44,266
POLICE BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE 

2652
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,001
LONE GUNMAN IN CUSTODY BUT THEY 

2653
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:51,473
ARE DOING THEIR DUE DELL 

2654
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,407
GENTLE -- 

2655
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,975
DILIGENCE GOING THROUGH THE 

2656
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:54,209
SCHOOL.

2657
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,344
PARENTS ARE NOW ALLOWED TO PICK 

2658
01:16:56,344 --> 01:16:59,981
UP THEIR CHILDREN AT A STAGING 

2659
01:16:59,981 --> 01:17:00,282
AREA.

2660
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,249
THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS NOW 

2661
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,119
FROM LOCAL MEDIA, DIFFERENT NEWS

2662
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,387
OUTLETS REPORTING THAT THEY'RE 

2663
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:06,988
INTERVIEWING STUDENTS ON THE 

2664
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:08,456
SCENE AND THEY KNEW WHO THE 

2665
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:09,057
GUNMAN WAS. 

2666
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:10,492
>> WE'RE GETTING NEW VIDEO NOW 

2667
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:11,727
WE WANT TO SHOW YOU.

2668
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:12,527
I BELIEVE THIS IS COMING FROM 

2669
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:13,128
INSIDE THE SCHOOL AS THE 

2670
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:17,999
STUDENTS TRIED TO EVACUATE.

2671
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:20,569
>> GO THE AUDITORIUM!

2672
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:30,579
EVERYBODY GET DOWN!

2673
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:31,646
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

2674
01:17:31,646 --> 01:17:34,082
EVERYBODY DOWN. 

2675
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:35,250
>> FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE 

2676
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,318
COMMISSIONER, RAY KELLY, ONE OF 

2677
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:39,754
THE THINGS I'M STRUCK BY, HOW 

2678
01:17:39,754 --> 01:17:41,156
CALM PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO REMAIN 

2679
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:41,956
AS THEY EVACUATED.

2680
01:17:41,956 --> 01:17:43,558
>> EXACTLY.

2681
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,862
HOW ORDERLY IT IS.

2682
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,330
AGAIN, THAT SORT OF SAYS THE 

2683
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,867
MIND-SET OF STUDENTS THESE DAYS.

2684
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,068
THIS IS NOW A RELATIVELY COMMON 

2685
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,169
EXPERIENCE AND IT HAS TO BE ON 

2686
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,138
THE MIND OF THE STUDENTS.

2687
01:17:56,138 --> 01:18:00,075
IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR 

2688
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:00,508
DISCIPLINE AS WELL.

2689
01:18:00,508 --> 01:18:02,511
IT'S A SIGN OF THE TIMES.

2690
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,679
>> SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT 

2691
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:06,514
PIERRE THOMAS, WE HAVE THE 

2692
01:18:06,514 --> 01:18:08,149
SHOOTER IN CUSTODY ACCORDING TO 

2693
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:09,251
LOCAL POLICE.

2694
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,285
THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS WILL 

2695
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,686
NOW KICK IN AS WELL BUT WE 

2696
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:13,188
SHOULD EMPHASIZE AS YOU DID 

2697
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,155
EARLIER, THE STUDENT WAS KNOWN 

2698
01:18:14,155 --> 01:18:16,724
TO OTHERS IN THE SCHOOL AND 

2699
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:17,659
THERE'S BEEN NO SIGN AT ALL THIS

2700
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,528
HAS ANY CONNECTION TO TERRORISM 

2701
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:20,862
OF ANY KIND. 

2702
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:21,997
>> NOT SO FAR, GEORGE, AND WE'VE

2703
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,632
TALKED TO MULTIPLE FEDERAL 

2704
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:24,166
SOURCES.

2705
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,333
NO INDICATION OF TERRORISM.

2706
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:28,103
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ISOLATED 

2707
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,671
INCIDENT INVOLVING A DISTURBED 

2708
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:30,705
YOUNG MAN.

2709
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:31,606
GEORGE, I CAN GIVE SOME 

2710
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:32,407
PERSPECTIVE TO OUR VIEWERS RIGHT

2711
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,209
NOW AT HOME WHO ARE PROBABLY 

2712
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,578
WONDERING HOW OFTEN THIS 

2713
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:41,116
HAPPENS.

2714
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,617
WE'RE AVERAGING ABOUT 300-PLUS 

2715
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:43,785
MASS SHOOTINGS PER YEAR.

2716
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:44,953
THE DEFINITION ACCORDING TO THE 

2717
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:47,622
GUN VIOLENCE ARCHIVE IS FOUR OR 

2718
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:52,127
MORE PEOPLE WOUNDED IN A SINGLE 

2719
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:52,394
INCIDENT.

2720
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:56,298
2017, 346 MASS SHOOTING 

2721
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:56,765
INCIDENTS.

01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:59,467
2016, 383 MASS SHOOTING 

2723
01:18:59,467 --> 01:18:59,734
INCIDENTS.

2724
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:01,502
SO ALMOST ONCE A DAY SOMEONE IN 

2725
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:03,838
THIS COUNTRY TAKES A WEAPON AND 

2726
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:07,209
SHOOTS AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE.

2727
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:08,243
>> AS WE'VE SAID, 18 SCHOOL 

2728
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:11,313
SHOOTINGS JUST THIS YEAR ALONE.

2729
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,013
VICK OQUENDO HAS NOW MADE HIS 

2730
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,148
WAY TO THE SCHOOL.

2731
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,584
YOU'RE ABOUT 500 FEET FROM THE 

2732
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:15,817

2733
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,218

2734
01:19:17,218 --> 01:19:18,552
GET RIGHT NOW TO THE SCHOOL, 

2735
01:19:18,552 --> 01:19:18,786
GEORGE.

2736
01:19:18,786 --> 01:19:19,987
JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK 

2737
01:19:19,987 --> 01:19:22,290
YOU'VE GOT LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST 

2738
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:25,694
LINING EVERY SINGLE INCH OF THIS

2739
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:25,894
AREA.

2740
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:27,595
YOU'VE GOT STUDENTS AND PARENTS 

2741
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:28,296
VERY CONCERNED.

2742
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,430
I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO A FEW 

2743
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,932
PARENTS ON THE WAY OVER HERE 

2744
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,133
SAYING, LOOK, WE HEARD ABOUT 

2745
01:19:32,133 --> 01:19:33,334
THIS AND COULDN'T GET IN TOUCH 

2746
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:34,802
WITH OUR SON OR DAUGHTER FOR 

2747
01:19:34,802 --> 01:19:35,370
ABOUT AN HOUR.

2748
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,673
WE CAME RIGHT OVER HERE, AND 

2749
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:41,576
THIS IS AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET 

2750
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:42,210
RIGHT NOW.

2751
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,612
THERE IS SOME RELIEF KNOWING 

2752
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,780
THAT THERE IS A SUSPECT IN 

2753
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:46,214
CUSTODY RIGHT NOW. 

2754
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,214
>> VICTOR, IF YOU LET ME 

2755
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:49,050
INTERRUPT YOU, WE BELIEVE WHAT 

2756
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,452
WE'RE SEEING ON THE SCENE IN 

2757
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:53,421
THAT AMBULANCE, WE BELIEVE THE 

2758
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:54,556
SHOOTER IS IN THAT AMBULANCE 

2759
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:55,957
BEING TAKEN AWAY.

2760
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:56,958
THE POLICE HAVE SAID THE SHOOTER

2761
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,560
IS IN CUSTODY.

2762
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,961
>> POLICE HAVE SAID THAT THE 

2763
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,430
SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY AND OUR 

2764
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,098
AFFILIATE WAS ALSO REPORTING 

2765
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:07,402
THAT THEY'VE TAKEN A FAMILY 

2766
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,335
MEMBER, POSSIBLY A SIBLING, 

2767
01:20:08,335 --> 01:20:11,973
MAYBE A BROTHER, FOR QUESTIONING

2768
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:12,240
AS WELL.

2769
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,042
THOSE ARE THE LATEST REPORTS 

2770
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:14,242
HERE.

2771
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,277
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, RIGHT 

2772
01:20:16,277 --> 01:20:17,812
NOW I'M JUST FEET AWAY FROM THE 

2773
01:20:17,812 --> 01:20:18,780
SCHOOL.

2774
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,681
POLICE EVERYWHERE.

2775
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:23,551
YOU CAN STILL HEAR SIRENS, 

2776
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:24,051
REC

2777
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:24,652
HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR AND 

2778
01:20:24,652 --> 01:20:25,553
STUDENTS IN TEARS OUT HERE. 

2779
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:27,155
>> VICTOR, AS FAR AS YOU CAN 

2780
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:30,058
TELL, ARE ALL THE STUDENTS OUT 

2781
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:30,592
OF THE SCHOOL YET?

2782
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,294
>> IT'S TOUGH TO SAY.

2783
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,362
IT'S SUCH A BIG SCHOOL.

2784
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:37,732
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY 

2785
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,167
WERE STILL GOING THROUGH IT BUT 

2786
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,201
AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW IT DOES 

2787
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:41,202
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DOING THEIR 

2788
01:20:41,202 --> 01:20:42,737
BEST TO ESCORT AS MANY STUDENTS 

2789
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:44,238
AWAY, GETTING THEM DOWN TO A 

2790
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:45,373
NEARBY PARK SO THEY CAN MEET UP 

2791
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:46,408
WITH FAMILY.

2792
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:47,575
>> YOU'RE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE

2793
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:49,377
NOW OF A MAJOR SCHOOL SHOOTING 

2794
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,446
IN SOUTH FLORIDA, PARKLAND, 

2795
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,280
FLORIDA.

2796
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,982
THAT'S VIDEO OF THE SHOOTER 

2797
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,718
BELIEVED TO BE IN CUSTODY NOW, 

2798
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:57,218
ACCORDING TO LOCAL LAW 

2799
01:20:57,218 --> 01:20:57,719
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:01,156
IT ALL BEGAN TO UNFOLD 2:20 P.M.

2801
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:02,957
EASTERN TIME AT THE MARJORY 

2802
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:04,392
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN 

2803
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:04,659
PARKLAND.

2804
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,728
IT'S A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL, TEN 

2805
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:07,829
BUILDINGS, 3,000 STUDENTS.

2806
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:08,763
ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES ON 

2807
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:11,499
THE SCENE, THE SHOOTING BEGAN 

2808
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,401
AROUND 2:20 WITH THE SOUND OF 

2809
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,937
WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GARBAGE 

2810
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:18,173
TRUCK BACKING UP AND FOUR TO SIX

2811
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:19,040
MINUTES OF SHOTS.

2812
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,275
THAT'S VIDEO OF STUDENTS BEING 

2813
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:24,012
EVACUATED FROM INSIDE.

2814
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,814
THE EVACUATIONS WENT ON FOR MORE

2815
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:26,881
THAN AN HOUR.

2816
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,282
ACCORDING TO OUR EYE WITNESS, 

2817
01:21:28,282 --> 01:21:30,018
THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT FOUR TO 

2818
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,553
SIX MINUTES OF SHOOTING.

2819
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,723
THIS IS A MASS CASUALTY EVENT, 

2820
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:37,458
AT LEAST 14 INJURED, REPORTS OF 

2821
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:38,593
AT LEAST ONE FATALITY.

2822
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,061
WE'VE HEARD THAT TWO OTHER 

2823
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,696
VICTIMS WERE SEEN DEAD ON THE 

2824
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:42,764
GROUND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM.

2825
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,299
THERE YOU SEE PICTURES OF SOME 

2826
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,368
OF THE INJURED BEING TAKEN AWAY 

2827
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:47,235
JUST MOMENTS AGO.

2828
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,738
WE SAW AERIAL FOOTAGE OF THE 

2829
01:21:50,738 --> 01:21:52,940
SHOOTER BEING TAKEN AWAY IN 

2830
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,310
CUSTODY IN AN AMBULANCE DRIVING 

2831
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,277
DOWN THE HIGHWAY.

2832
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:58,079
BRAD GARRETT, ONE OF THE THINGS 

2833
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,383
WE JUST HEARD AS WELL FROM 

2834
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,417
VICTOR OQUENDO IS THAT A FAMILY 

2835
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:05,620
MEMBER OF THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE 

2836
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,988
ALSO BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR

2837
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,189
QUESTIONING AGAIN.

2838
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:08,622
STANDARD PRACTICE. 

2839
01:22:08,622 --> 01:22:09,591
>> IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE, 

2840
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,093
GEORGE, BUT WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

2841
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,194
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO KNOW AT 

2842
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,564
THE VERY LEAST SOMETHING ABOUT 

2843
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:17,699
THE WEAPONS.

2844
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:18,800
IF THEY LIVE TOGETHER IN THE 

2845
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,001
SAME HOUSE, HE MAY HAVE HAD 

2846
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:20,968
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS BROTHER 

2847
01:22:20,968 --> 01:22:27,442
ABOUT HIS ANGER, RAGE, HIS 

2848
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,276
DISAPP

2849
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,811
DISAPPOINTMENT, HIS FEELING THAT

2850
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:31,279
HE CAN'T CONTROL HIS LIFE.

2851
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,548
I GUESS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO 

2852
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,083
IS IF HE ACTUALLY TALKED TO HIM 

2853
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,284
ABOUT PLANNING THIS.

2854
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,886
THAT OBVIOUSLY REMAINS TO BE 

2855
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:38,119
SCENE. 

2856
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:38,787
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2857
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,488
CHIEF DAVID BROWN NOW JOINING US

2858
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,724

2859
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:43,724
THE SHOOTER IN CUSTODY BUT MUCH 

2860
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:46,694
MORE POLICE WORK LEFT TO BE 

2861
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:46,927
DONE.

2862
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:47,995
>> THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF 

2863
01:22:47,995 --> 01:22:50,765
THE POLICE WORK STARTS NOW WITH 

2864
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:52,700
TRYING TO FIND MOTIVES, TRYING 

2865
01:22:52,700 --> 01:23:01,442
TO FIND CUPLPABILITY THROUGH TH 

2866
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:04,713
INTERROGATION OF THE SUSPECT.

2867
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:05,713
IT MAY BE A LONG SEVERAL DAYS OF

2868
01:23:05,713 --> 01:23:06,380
INVESTIGATION BEFORE WE FIGURE 

2869
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,883
OUT ANY OF WHAT'S HAPPENED 

2870
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:09,083
TODAY.

2871
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,918
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, 

2872
01:23:10,918 --> 01:23:12,887
ALONG WITH NOTIFYING THESE 

2873
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:16,190
PARENTS OF THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE 

2874
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:17,225
WHO HAVE BEEN LOST IN THIS 

2875
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,159
TRAGEDY, ALONG WITH WHAT I'VE 

2876
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,794
HEARD EARLIER IS THAT MAYBE A 

2877
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,028
TEACHER OR OTHER ADULTS MAY HAVE

2878
01:23:21,028 --> 01:23:22,864
BEEN LOST IN THIS TRAGEDY AS 

2879
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:23,064
WELL.

2880
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:24,833
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF 

2881
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,100
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF IT. 

2882
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,302
>> CHIEF, THANKS VERY MUCH.

2883
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:28,937
I WANT TO BRING IN MATTHEW 

2884
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:34,676
WALKER, A 17-YEAR-OLD JR. UNIOR.

2885
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:35,610
MATT, WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

2886
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,778
TELL US ABOUT YOUR AFTERNOON.

2887
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:38,746
>> I WAS IN CLASS.

2888
01:23:38,746 --> 01:23:40,014
IT'S THE LAST PERIOD OF THE DAY.

2889
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:42,217
I WAS JUST DOING MY WORK, KIND 

2890
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:44,853
OF NEAR THE END OF THE BELL.

2891
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,687
OUT OF NOWHERE I HEAR BANGING IN

2892
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:47,555
THE HALLWAYS.

2893
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,190
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SOME KID 

2894
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,092
MESSING AROUND BUT IT GOT LOUDER

2895
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:52,327
AND LOUDER.

2896
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,096
THE GUY STARTED SHOOTING THROUGH

2897
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:56,530
LIKE THE LITTLE WINDOW, THROUGH 

2898
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:57,332
THE DOOR.

2899
01:23:57,332 --> 01:24:00,101
IT WAS REALLY LOUD.

2900
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:00,768
THERE WERE BULLET HOLES 

2901
01:24:00,768 --> 01:24:01,068
EVERYWHERE.

2902
01:24:01,068 --> 01:24:02,537
EVERYONE WAS FREAKING OUT. 

2903
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:03,771
>> CAN I STOP YOU THERE, MATT.

2904
01:24:03,771 --> 01:24:04,939
COULD YOU SEE THE SHOOTER?

2905
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:07,475
>> I DID NOT SEE THE SHOOTER BUT

2906
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:10,545
I DID -- HE DID SHOOT THROUGH MY

2907
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:10,812
CLASS.

2908
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,447
>> HE SHOT INTO YOUR CLASSROOM.

2909
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,382
WAS ANYBODY HIT?

2910
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:17,252
>> YES, THERE WERE KIDS INJURED,

2911
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:19,354
BUT HE COULDN'T GET INSIDE 

2912
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,354
BECAUSE THE DOOR WAS LOCKED BUT 

2913
01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:24,125
HE WAS SHOOTING THROUGH THE 

2914
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:24,325
GLASS.

2915
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:25,760
>> COULD YOU TELL HOW FAR AWAY 

2916
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,862
HE WAS FROM THE DOOR?

2917
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:30,231
>> I CANNOT.

2918
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,534
I COOPEULDN'T SEE HIM. 

2919
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:33,201
>> ABOUT HOW MANY SHOTS DID HE 

2920
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:35,135
FIRE INTO THE CLASSROOM?

2921
01:24:35,135 --> 01:24:37,338
>> I'D PROBABLY SAY 10 TO 12.

2922
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:37,605
A LOT. 

2923
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,106
>> THOSE 10 OR 12 SHOTS, EVEN 

2924
01:24:39,106 --> 01:24:41,375
THOUGH I'M SURE IT HAPPENED 

2925
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:42,677
QUICKLY, IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE 

2926
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:42,944
FOREVER. 

2927
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:44,078
>> AFTER THAT HE KIND OF JUST 

2928
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:47,248
WENT TO OTHER CLASSES AND DID 

2929
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,183
THE SAME THING.

2930
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,118
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE AT 

2931
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:53,087
ALL -- GO AHEAD.

2932
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:54,355
>> HE WAS JUST GOING CLASS TO 

2933
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,658
CLASS JUST SHOOTING AT RANDOM 

2934
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:56,858
KIDS.

2935
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,125
WHEN THE POLICE WERE ESCORTING 

2936
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:02,396
ME OUT OF THE BUILDING, THERE 

2937
01:25:02,396 --> 01:25:04,265
WAS A DEAD -- I DON'T KNOW IF HE

2938
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,067
WAS DEAD OR NOT BUT THERE WAS A 

2939
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,602
DEAD GUY ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO 

2940
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:07,768
ME. 

2941
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:08,502
>> HOW LONG DID YOU HEAR 

2942
01:25:08,502 --> 01:25:12,240
SHOOTING GOING ON?

2943
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:12,974
>> TWO MINUTES.

2944
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,809
TWO, THREE MINUTES.

2945
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:16,544
>> THEN HE JUST KEPT WALKING 

2946
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:17,945
FROM CLASSROOM TO CLASSROOM.

2947
01:25:17,945 --> 01:25:19,079
TELL US ABOUT THE CONDITION OF 

2948
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:19,680
THE STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM 

2949
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,917
WITH YOU.

2950
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,285
>> MOSTLY EVERYONE WAS OKAY IN 

2951
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:27,288
MY CLASS BUT A FEW KIDS WERE 

2952
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:27,655
INJURED.

2953
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:28,990
>> NOT SERIOUSLY?

2954
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,158
>> I THINK ONE WAS SERIOUS BUT 

2955
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:33,494
THE OTHERS, I DON'T KNOW.

2956
01:25:33,494 --> 01:25:34,929
>> TELL US WHAT HAPPENED 

2957
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:35,229
AFTERWARDS.

2958
01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:37,731
WHEN WERE YOU ABLE TO GET OUT OF

2959
01:25:37,731 --> 01:25:38,733
THE CLASSROOM?

2960
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:42,303
>> THE COPS CAME IN LIKE FIVE 

2961
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:43,304
MINUTES, SO THEY WERE QUICK 

2962
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,872
ABOUT IT WHEN THEY GOT HERE AND 

2963
01:25:44,872 --> 01:25:46,907
EVERYONE WAS, LIKE, CLEAR, THEY 

2964
01:25:46,907 --> 01:25:48,175
CAME IN OUR CLASS, MADE SURE WE 

2965
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:48,809
WERE ALL OKAY AND EVACUATED ALL 

2966
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:51,579
OF US.

2967
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:53,848
>> SINCE YOU'VE BEEN OUT, HAVE 

2968
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:56,284
YOU HEARD ANYTHING MORE ABOUT 

2969
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:57,618
THE SHOOTER OR ABOUT YOUR 

2970
01:25:57,618 --> 01:25:58,519
FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES IN THE 

2971
01:25:58,519 --> 01:25:58,752
SCHOOL?

2972
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:02,857
>> WELL, I HEARD THAT THE 

2973
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:08,263
SHOOTER WAS A FORMER STUDENT AT 

2974
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:08,496
DOUGLAS.

2975
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,997
HE HAS AN INSTAGRAM AND 

2976
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:14,102
EVERYTHING HE POSTS IS ABOUT 

2977
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:14,469
WEAPONS.

2978
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:14,869
IT'S SICK.

2979
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:17,204
>> TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT 

2980
01:26:17,204 --> 01:26:22,010
INSTAGRAM FROM THE FORMER 

2981
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:22,243
STUDENT.

2982
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,545
>> WELL, I ONLY SAW A PICTURE OF

2983
01:26:24,545 --> 01:26:26,747
IT BUT ALL HE DOES IS HE'S JUST 

2984
01:26:26,747 --> 01:26:29,150
POSTING HIS WEAPONS AND STUFF ON

2985
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,219
HIS INSTAGRAM, KIND OF LIKE 

2986
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:32,353
SHOWING OFF HIS KNIVES AND GUNS 

2987
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,388
AND STUFF LIKE THAT. 

2988
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:34,922
>> AND YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE 

2989
01:26:34,922 --> 01:26:35,657
SOME VIDEO.

2990
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:36,824
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO 

2991
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,860
SHOW THIS RIGHT NOW.

2992
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:44,132
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT WE'RE 

2993
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:47,268
SEEING?

2994
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:48,770
>> I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

2995
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,072
THE CLASS AND HE JUST STARTED 

2996
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:54,208
SHOOTING THROUGH THE DOOR AT THE

2997
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,408
KIDS. 

2998
01:26:54,408 --> 01:26:55,676
>> THAT IS A LOT OF SHOTS IN A 

2999
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:57,945
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, JUST A 

3000
01:26:57,945 --> 01:26:58,546
TERRIFYING FEW MOMENTS THERE, 

3001
01:26:58,546 --> 01:26:58,779
MATTHEW.

3002
01:26:58,779 --> 01:27:03,217
>> IT WAS AWFUL.

3003
01:27:03,217 --> 01:27:04,752
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW?

3004
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:09,090
>> I'M OKAY, I'M WITH MY MOM.

3005
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:09,624
WE'RE SAFE.

3006
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,792
>> HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ANY OF 

3007
01:27:11,792 --> 01:27:14,128
YOUR OTHER CLASSMATES?

3008
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:14,862
ARE YOUR FRIENDS OKAY?

3009
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,865
>> SO FAR ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE 

3010
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:18,065
OKAY.

3011
01:27:18,065 --> 01:27:20,134
I HOPE -- I JUST HOPE EVERYONE, 

3012
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:23,037
YOU KNOW, GOES THROUGH IT AND 

3013
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,340
JUST PRAY, YOU KNOW.

3014
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:29,510
I'M BLESSED TO BE ALIVE.

3015
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,212
>> YOU ARE BLESSED TO BE ALIVE.

3016
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:33,914
MATTHEW, THANK YOU FOR SHARING 

3017
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:34,248
THAT WITH US.

3018
01:27:34,248 --> 01:27:34,649
GO HUG YOUR MOM.

3019
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,283
I KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH TIME BUT 

3020
01:27:36,283 --> 01:27:37,852
THANK YOU FOR TELLING US WHAT 

3021
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,186
HAPPENED, FOR GIVING US THAT 

3022
01:27:39,186 --> 01:27:42,290
SCENE INSIDE THE CLASSROOM.

3023
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,292
I'M HERE WITH TOM LLAMAS AND RAY

3024
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:44,492
KELLY.

3025
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,427
IT JUST SHOWS, BOY, WHEN YOU GET

3026
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:47,795
INSIDE THAT CLASSROOM, PUT 

3027
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,096
YOURSELF IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF 

3028
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:49,864
THOSE YOUNG STUDENTS.

3029
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:51,699
AS MATTHEW SAID, THIS IS THE END

3030
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:52,566
OF THE DAY, THEY'RE WRAPPING UP 

3031
01:27:52,566 --> 01:27:54,168
THEIR DAY AND THEN GUNSHOTS 

3032
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,403
THROUGH THE DOOR OF YOUR 

3033
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:56,270
CLASSROOM.

3034
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:58,639
>> ABSOLUTELY.

3035
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,007
HE SEEMS VERY CALM AND 

3036
01:28:00,007 --> 01:28:00,274
COLLECTED.

3037
01:28:00,274 --> 01:28:03,110
WHAT A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT

3038
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,310
IS.

3039
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,046
HE'LL HAVE IT FOR THE REST OF 

3040
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:07,515
HIS LIFE.

3041
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:08,816
THANK GOD THOSE DOORS WITHHELD 

3042
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,152
THE SHOOTING OR HIS ATTEMPT TO 

3043
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:13,388
GET IN.

3044
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:14,755
SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO 

3045
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:15,823
SHOOT THROUGH THE GLASS. 

3046
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,425
>> WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

3047
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:18,626
ALL DAY.

3048
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,127
THE DOORS LOCKED IMMEDIATELY, 

3049
01:28:20,127 --> 01:28:20,995
ALL THE STUDENTS FOLLOWING THE 

3050
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:22,497
TRAINING THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN AND 

3051
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:23,030
THAT SAVES LIVES. 

3052
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,366
>> NOT ONLY THAT BUT THAT THE 

3053
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:26,233
STUDENTS REALIZED IMMEDIATELY 

3054
01:28:26,233 --> 01:28:26,901
WHAT HAPPENS.

3055
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:28,770
USUALLY WHEN WE COVER THESE MASS

3056
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:29,470
SHOOTINGS, ADULTS WILL TELL YOU 

3057
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,505
IT SOUNDED LIKE FIREWORKS, IT 

3058
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:32,640
SOUNDED LIKE THE BACK OF A CAR 

3059
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,874
OR SOMETHING BUT THESE STUDENTS 

3060
01:28:33,874 --> 01:28:35,243
HAVE NOW LIVED THROUGH SO MANY 

3061
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:36,244
OF THESE SHOOTINGS.

3062
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,378
THEY'VE SEEN IT ON TELEVISION 

3063
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:39,180
SINCE THEY WERE BORN ALMOST.

3064
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,748
WE'VE HAD SO MANY SCHOOL 

3065
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:41,015
SHOOTINGS.

3066
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,149
THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

3067
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:43,985
I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING 

3068
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:44,285
ELSE.

3069
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:46,454
A PATTERN IS STARTING TO EMERGE 

3070
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:47,755
FROM THE STUDENTS WHO WERE IN 

3071
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:49,590
THAT SCHOOL CLAIMING -- AND IT'S

3072
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:50,424
STILL EARLY BUT CLAIMING THAT 

3073
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:53,628
THIS WAS POSSIBLY A STUDENT OR A

3074
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:54,595
FORMER STUDENT.

3075
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:55,863
THAT MAY EXPLAIN HOW THE SHOOTER

3076
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:57,165
GOT INTO THE SCHOOL IN THE FIRST

3077
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:57,398
PLACE. 

3078
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:58,899
>> WE DID HEAR FROM MATTHEW 

3079
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:01,001
WALKER THAT DETAIL OF THE 

3080
01:29:01,001 --> 01:29:02,203
INSTAGRAM OF THAT FORMER STUDENT

3081
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:03,571
SHOWING OFF GUNS, WEAPONS, 

3082
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:03,804
KNIVES.

3083
01:29:03,804 --> 01:29:04,972
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE AMBULANCE

3084
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:06,841
THAT WAS TRANSPORTING THE 

3085
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,977
SHOOTER, NOW PULLING UP TO THE 

3086
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:10,244
HOSPITAL.

3087
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,613
WE COULDN'T TELL FROM THE 

3088
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:15,349
EARLIER VIDEO OF HIM IF HE HAD 

3089
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:17,452
BEEN INJURED.

3090
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:18,685
TOM, ARE WE LEARNING MORE ABOUT 

3091
01:29:18,685 --> 01:29:18,886
THAT?

3092
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,755
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ASK MY 

3093
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:22,323
SOURCES WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, IF

3094
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:24,491
HE WAS INJURED.

3095
01:29:24,491 --> 01:29:25,759
HE DIDN'T LOOK INJURED BUT IT 

3096
01:29:25,759 --> 01:29:27,962
LOOKED LIKE HE HAD TROUBLE 

3097
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:28,262
STANDING UP.

3098
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,030
IN FLORIDA THEY HAVE THE BAKER 

3099
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,598
ACT WHERE WHEN POLICE THINK 

3100
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:33,801
SOMEBODY IS MENTALLY ILL THEY 

3101
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:36,037
CAN TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL 

3102
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:36,337
IMMEDIATELY.

3103
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:38,172
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT 

3104
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:39,273
HAPPENED HERE BUT IT'S A STATE 

3105
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:40,208
LAW IN FLORIDA.

3106
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,343
WE KNOW HE HAD SOME TROUBLE 

3107
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:43,644
STANDING UP AFTER THE SHOOTING. 

3108
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:45,212
>> WHOEVER THAT WAS IS NOW BEING

3109
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:47,148
WHEELED INTO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT 

3110
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:47,348
THERE.

3111
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:49,116
PIERRE THOMAS, OF COURSE ATF IS 

3112
01:29:49,116 --> 01:29:50,718
GOING TO GET INVOLVED AND TRY TO

3113
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,454
FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THESE 

3114
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:53,687
WEAPONS.

3115
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:56,023
>> IT WILL BE A HUGE PRIORITY, 

3116
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:57,291
GEORGE, AND THEY CAN TYPICALLY 

3117
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,926
FIND OUT WITHIN 24 HOURS OR LESS

3118
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:00,494
WHERE THESE GUNS CAME FROM, IF 

3119
01:30:00,494 --> 01:30:01,996
THEY WERE BOUGHT LOCALLY, IF 

3120
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:03,965
THEY CAME FROM PARENTS OR 

3121
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:04,332
FRIENDS.

3122
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:06,300
THAT WILL BE A KEY ELEMENT IN 

3123
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,167
HELPING THEM PUT TOGETHER THE 

3124
01:30:07,167 --> 01:30:10,938
PICTURE OF HOW THIS WENT DOWN.

3125
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:11,739
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SOURCES 

3126
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:14,742
ARE SAYING ALREADY, GEORGE, IS 

3127
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,977
THAT GUNS ARE SO WIDELY 

3128
01:30:16,977 --> 01:30:18,345
AVAILABLE, THAT WILL BE A PART 

3129
01:30:18,345 --> 01:30:19,380
OF THE STORY BUT SOMETHING THAT 

3130
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:20,915
THEY EXPECT THAT THIS PERSON HAD

3131
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,583
EASY ACCESS TO THE WEAPONS, 

3132
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:22,816
GEORGE. 

3133
01:30:22,816 --> 01:30:24,084
>> WE HAVE MORE VIDEO COMING IN 

3134
01:30:24,084 --> 01:30:25,553
NOW OF ONE OF THE STUDENTS AT 

3135
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:26,387
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL SPEAKING 

3136
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:33,394
ABOUT A TEACHER WHO WAS INJURED.

3137
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:34,028
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

3138
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:35,196
>> HE WAS SHOT.

3139
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:37,097
EVERYONE GOT OUT OF THE CLASSES 

3140
01:30:37,097 --> 01:30:39,800
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE

3141
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:40,000
DRILL.

3142
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,103
BUT THEN -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT 

3143
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:42,370
HAPPENED.

3144
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,871
JUST EVERYONE STARTED RUNNING 

3145
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:46,140
BACK TO THE CLASS AND THEN I 

3146
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:46,440
JUST RAN. 

3147
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,643
>> WHAT IS YOUR TEACHER'S NAME?

3148
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:51,445
>> MR. BEAGLE.

3149
01:30:51,445 --> 01:30:52,947
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WAS SHOT?

3150
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:56,551
>> BECAUSE WE SAW HIS BODY FOR 

3151
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,252
LIKE 30 MINUTES.

3152
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:03,557
WE WERE JUST LIKE PRAYING AND 

3153
01:31:03,557 --> 01:31:05,225
CRYING AND -- AND THEN THE 

3154
01:31:05,225 --> 01:31:08,396
POLICE CAME AND WE JUST GOT OUT.

3155
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:11,231
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO SHOT HIM?

3156
01:31:11,231 --> 01:31:12,066
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

3157
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:12,833
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

3158
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:14,101
I JUST SAW HIS HEAD BECAUSE HE 

3159
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,103
WAS BLOCKING THE DOOR SO THE 

3160
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:19,940
DOOR WAS OPEN ALL THE TIME.

3161
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:20,540
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE ALIVE.

3162
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:22,777
>> ONE OF THE STUDENTS THERE AT 

3163
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:25,313
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL, HER TEACHER

3164
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:25,846
WAS SHOT.

3165
01:31:25,846 --> 01:31:27,615
WE DID GET SOME VIDEO JUST 

3166
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:28,882
MOMENTS AGO FROM MATTHEW WALKER,

3167
01:31:28,882 --> 01:31:31,084
A STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL WHO WAS 

3168
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:32,286
IN ONE OF THE CLASSROOMS WHERE 

3169
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:35,389
THE SHOOTER STARTED SHOOTING 

3170
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:36,324
INSIDE THE CLASSROOM THROUGH A 

3171
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:36,624
LOCKED DOOR.

3172
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:44,265
TAKE A LOOK.

3173
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:48,836
[ GUNSHOTS ]

3174
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:53,641
>> OH, MY GOD!

3175
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:54,875
>> APPEARS TO BE MORE THAN A 

3176
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:55,743
DOZEN SHOTS.

3177
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:57,845
I WANT TO BRING IN FORMER 

3178
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:58,579
SPECIAL AGENT BRAD GARRETT.

3179
01:31:58,579 --> 01:31:59,713
THE STORIES ARE LINING UP RIGHT 

3180
01:31:59,713 --> 01:32:02,415
NOW FROM SEVERAL EYE WITNESSES.

3181
01:32:02,415 --> 01:32:04,151
WHAT STARTED AS SOME KIND OF A 

3182
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,587
BOOM OR A COMMOTION FOLLOWED BY 

3183
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:09,256
SHOTS AND THEN THE SHOOTER GOING

3184
01:32:09,256 --> 01:32:11,025
METHODICALLY FROM CLASSROOM TO 

3185
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,595
CLASSROOM FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, 

3186
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:16,130
THANKFULLY AT TIMES FINDING 

3187
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,665
LOCKED DOORS WHICH LIMITED THE 

3188
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:17,932
INJURIES. 

3189
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:19,066
>> EXACTLY.

3190
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:22,269
IT REMINDED ME IMMEDIATELY, 

3191
01:32:22,269 --> 01:32:24,305
GEORGE, OF VIRGINIA TECH.

3192
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,374
HE CHAINED THE DOOR SHUT SO 

3193
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,609
POLICE COULDN'T GET IN AND WENT 

3194
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:29,610
METHODICALLY ROOM TO ROOM AND HE

3195
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,578
WAS ABLE OBVIOUSLY TO GET INTO 

3196
01:32:31,578 --> 01:32:33,014
THE CLASSROOMS.

3197
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:36,550
LOCKED DOORS OR REINFORCED DOORS

3198
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:37,217
I'M SURE SAVED A NUMBER OF SAVES

3199
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:37,417
TODAY.

3200
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:41,054
>> AND WE'VE SEEN SO MANY SCHOOL

3201
01:32:41,054 --> 01:32:42,556
DISTRICTS NOW IMPLEMENT SO MANY 

3202
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:43,757
SECURITY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE

3203
01:32:43,757 --> 01:32:44,358
PREVALENCE OF SHOOTINGS LIKE 

3204
01:32:44,358 --> 01:32:47,128
THIS.

3205
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:47,595
>> THEY HAVE.

3206
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:49,863
THE CHALLENGE, GEORGE, IS LOOK 

3207
01:32:49,863 --> 01:32:51,765
AT THIS SCHOOL PHYSICALLY AS WE 

3208
01:32:51,765 --> 01:32:53,901
HAVE AERIAL VIEWS OF IT.

3209
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:58,839
YOU LITERALLY COULDN'T SORT OF 

3210
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:01,608
CHOKE THIS INTO THE SCHOOL AND 

3211
01:33:01,608 --> 01:33:02,542
EFFECTIVELY HAVE THE SCHOOL 

3212
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:04,111
FUNCTION DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

3213
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:06,180
THE ABILITY TO CONTROL WEAPONS, 

3214
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,616
KNIVES, ET CETERA INTO A SCHOOL 

3215
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:10,151
BECAUSE OF THE FLUID NATURE OF A

3216
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:11,952
SCHOOL IS A REALLY BIG CHALLENGE

3217
01:33:11,952 --> 01:33:14,588
WHICH REALLY THEN GOES TO THE 

3218
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:14,922
FOLLOWING.

3219
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:16,290
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO 

3220
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,859
STOP MASS SHOOTERS, WE'RE NOT 

3221
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:20,861
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH 

3222
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:21,862
WEAPON RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE IT'S

3223
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:23,898
JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 

3224
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:24,231
REALISTICALLY.

3225
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,666
IT'S ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE.

3226
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,001
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 

3227
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:29,970
FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS AND 

3228
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:31,639
ALSO AS THEY IDENTIFY TROUBLED 

3229
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,207
KIDS, MASS SHOOTER OR NOT, 

3230
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:34,308
POTENTIAL DOWN THE ROAD, YOU 

3231
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:35,676
ADDRESS IT AND DEAL WITH IT. 

3232
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:36,877
>> THAT GETS TO THE NEXT THING I

3233
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:38,312
WANTED TO ASK YOU.

3234
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:41,382
WE'VE ONLY HEARD THIS FROM ONE 

3235
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:42,916
STUDENT, MATTHEW WALKER TALKING 

3236
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:44,284
ABOUT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE 

3237
01:33:44,284 --> 01:33:44,918
FORMER STUDENT BELIEVED TO BE 

3238
01:33:44,918 --> 01:33:47,421
THE SHOOTER HAD AN INSTAGRAM 

3239
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:50,057
ACCOUNT WHERE HE WAS DISPLAYING 

3240
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:51,358
WEAPONS, GUNS AND KNIVES. 

3241
01:33:51,358 --> 01:33:52,326
>> HE'S SHOWING OFF ABOUT WHAT 

3242
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:56,730
HE'S GOING TO DO AND HE'S GOING 

3243
01:33:56,730 --> 01:33:57,965
TO TAKE ON THE POWER.

3244
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,200
CHO DID THE SAME THING.

3245
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,768
REMEMBER THAT FOOTAGE HE SENT TO

3246
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:02,736
NBC BACK IN 2007 OF WHAT HE HAD,

3247
01:34:02,736 --> 01:34:04,839
WHAT HE WAS GOING TO USE 

3248
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:05,239
POTENTIALLY.

3249
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,506
IT CAME AFTER THE FACT OBVIOUSLY

3250
01:34:06,506 --> 01:34:07,775
BUT THAT'S PART OF THE POWER 

3251
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:09,610
BUILDUP FOR THESE GUYS.

3252
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:12,146
THEY WANT US TO KNOW, THEY WANT 

3253
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:12,780
CERTAIN PEOPLE TO KNOW THEY'RE 

3254
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:13,814
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS 

3255
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:17,584
AND THOSE OF YOU THAT I DON'T 

3256
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:19,252
LIKE HAVE BELITTLED ME, WHATEVER

3257
01:34:19,252 --> 01:34:21,789
IS IN HIS HEAD AS TO WHY HE WAS 

3258
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:23,124
JUSTIFIED IN COMMITTING THE 

3259
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:24,058
SHOOTING, I'M COMING AFTER YOU. 

3260
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:26,527
>> WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN A STUDENT

3261
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:28,028
SEES AN INSTAGRAM POST LIKE 

3262
01:34:28,028 --> 01:34:29,863
THAT, WHEN I TEACHER SEES AN 

3263
01:34:29,863 --> 01:34:33,667
INSTAGRAM POST LIKE THAT, WHAT'S

3264
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:34,235
NEXT?

3265
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:35,769
>> WHAT'S NEXT, GEORGE, YOU 

3266
01:34:35,769 --> 01:34:38,973
REPORT THAT TO SOMEBODY IN THE 

3267
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:39,373
SCHOOL.

3268
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,074
MANY SCHOOLS TODAY, GEORGE, 

3269
01:34:41,074 --> 01:34:42,710
PARTICULARLY IN VIRGINIA BECAUSE

3270
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,078
OF VIRGINIA TECH ACTUALLY HAVE 

3271
01:34:45,078 --> 01:34:46,514
THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS.

3272
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:50,351
THEY'RE USUALLY MADE UP OF THE 

3273
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,018
COMMUNITY POLICE RESOURCE 

3274
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:53,120
OFFICER ASSIGNED TO THE SCHOOL, 

3275
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,655
A PSYCHOLOGY, PEOPLE FROM THE 

3276
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:59,960
SCHOOL AND MAYBE SOME STUDENTS.

3277
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,962
AS THEY HEAR ABOUT TROUBLED 

3278
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:04,465
KIDS -- LET'S FACE IT, THEY HAVE

3279
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:05,766
TROUBLES, THEY HAVE ISSUES, THEY

3280
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:08,269
DON'T GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE, 

3281
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:09,670
THEY'RE MAD.

3282
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:10,671
SOME OF THAT'S GOT TO BE 

3283
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:11,739
ADDRESSED ON THE FRONT END.

3284
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,040
IT'S A COMBINATION OF 

3285
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,908
IDENTIFYING KIDS THAT NEED HELP 

3286
01:35:14,908 --> 01:35:17,444
BUT MOST IMPORTANT, THAT 

3287
01:35:17,444 --> 01:35:19,180
INFORMATION GETS TO THE STAFF 

3288
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:20,680
AND MAYBE THE POLICE OFFICER AT 

3289
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,182
THE SCHOOL.

3290
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:22,883
YOU GOT A KID THAT'S FLASHING 

3291
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:25,185
GUNS ON INSTAGRAM, YOU GOT TO 

3292
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:27,087
ADDRESS IT. 

3293
01:35:27,087 --> 01:35:29,223
>> STEVE GOMEZ, ALSO A FORMER 

3294
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:30,624
FBI SPECIAL AGENT.

3295
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:33,060
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN 

3296
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,761
PUZZLING US IS WE FIRST HEARD 

3297
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:37,198
THAT THE SHOOTER WAS INSIDE THE 

3298
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:38,165
SCHOOL, PERHAPS IN THE FRESHMAN 

3299
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:40,267
BUILDING, BUT WE SAW HIM BEING 

3300
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:43,838
ARRESTED LOOKS LIKE A COUPLE OF 

3301
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:44,271
BLOCKS AWAY.

3302
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:44,571
>> YES.

3303
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:46,106
AND THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN WHEN 

3304
01:35:46,106 --> 01:35:47,607
YOU RESPOND TO THIS TYPE OF 

3305
01:35:47,607 --> 01:35:49,142
SITUATION, YOU WANT TO TRY TO 

3306
01:35:49,142 --> 01:35:50,778
CREATE A PERIMETER TO WHERE 

3307
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:51,912
NOBODY CAN GET OUT, ESPECIALLY 

3308
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,647
THE SUSPECT, AND IT LOOKS LIKE 

3309
01:35:53,647 --> 01:35:55,249
THE SUSPECT WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT 

3310
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:58,786
OUT INTO A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD.

3311
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:00,254
IT WAS PROBABLY AN ESSENTIAL 

3312
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,722
PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS 

3313
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:04,324
GIVEN TO THE POLICE BY ONE OF 

3314
01:36:04,324 --> 01:36:05,425
THE STUDENTS OR FACULTY THAT 

3315
01:36:05,425 --> 01:36:06,827
PROBABLY LED THEM TO ONE OF 

3316
01:36:06,827 --> 01:36:07,528
THOSE LOCATIONS.

3317
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:08,762
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE INVESTIGATION

3318
01:36:08,762 --> 01:36:10,230
BEARS OUT, BUT THE POLICE 

3319
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:12,900
CLEARLY DID A GREAT JOB IN 

3320
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,067
APPREHENDING HIM OUTSIDE OF 

3321
01:36:14,067 --> 01:36:15,302
THEIR PERIMETER FROM WHAT IT 

3322
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:15,769
LOOKS LIKE. 

3323
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:17,771
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW HE 

3324
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:20,440
COULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE 

3325
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:23,277
SCHOOL, CERTAINLY HARD TO 

3326
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:24,078
IMAGINE HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT

3327
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:24,712
WITH ANY WEAPONS. 

3328
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:25,612
>> THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

3329
01:36:25,612 --> 01:36:27,414
HAVE TO PIECE TOGETHER THE 

3330
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:28,949
TIMELINE OF THE EVENTS FROM THE 

3331
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:30,584
FIRST SHOOTING ALL THE WAY TO 

3332
01:36:30,584 --> 01:36:30,951
THE LAST.

3333
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,387
DID HE GO IN THERE AND WAS HE 

3334
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:34,588
TARGETING A CERTAIN CLASS OR 

3335
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:37,224
CERTAIN GROUP OF STUDENTS.

3336
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:38,725
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS A 

3337
01:36:38,725 --> 01:36:40,160
FORMER STUDENT, DID HE HAVE SOME

3338
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,361
KIND OF PROBLEMS TO WHERE HE 

3339
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:43,864
JUST WENT IN THERE TO TARGET 

3340
01:36:43,864 --> 01:36:45,065
CERTAIN PEOPLE AND THEN TRIED TO

3341
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:45,933
GET OUT OF THERE.

3342
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:47,667
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

3343
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:49,169
BE PART OF THE INVESTIGATION AND

3344
01:36:49,169 --> 01:36:50,304
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO MOVE ON

3345
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,838
THAT QUICKLY. 

3346
01:36:51,838 --> 01:36:53,807
>> AS WE SAID, A SHOOTER IS IN 

3347
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:55,109
CUSTODY RIGHT NOW.

3348
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:56,410
TOM LLAMAS, WE'RE LEARNING BITS 

3349
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:58,212
AND PIECES NOW ABOUT THAT YOUNG 

3350
01:36:58,212 --> 01:36:58,378
MAN.

3351
01:36:58,378 --> 01:37:00,280
>> WE'RE HEARING FROM THE ONE 

3352
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,348
EYE WITNESS WHO TOLD US HE 

3353
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:02,883
THINKS IT WAS A FORMER STUDENT.

3354
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:05,052
OTHER STUDENTS ARE TELLING OTHER

3355
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:06,820
OUTLETS THAT IT WAS A FORMER 

3356
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:08,589
STUDENT, A STUDENT WHO WENT 

3357
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:08,789
THERE.

3358
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:10,724
SOME REPORTS EVEN SAY A TROUBLED

3359
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:11,225
STUDENT.

3360
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:12,926
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME 

3361
01:37:12,926 --> 01:37:13,760
CONFLICTING INFORMATION FROM 

3362
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,596
WHAT THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS SAID

3363
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:16,463
AS FAR AS WERE THERE ANY WARNING

3364
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:18,732
SIGNS AND OTHER REPORTS THAT ARE

3365
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:20,233
CIRCULATING AROUND THERE, 

3366
01:37:20,233 --> 01:37:21,235
OBVIOUSLY IT'S SO HARD TO 

3367
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:24,171
PREPARE FOR A SITUATION LIKE 

3368
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:24,772
THIS OR EVEN PREDICT ANYTHING 

3369
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:25,706
LIKE THIS HAPPENING EVEN THOUGH 

3370
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:26,740
WE HAVE COVERED SO MANY OF THESE

3371
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,475
BUT SOMETHING I DO WANT TO SAY 

3372
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:30,244
AN UPDATE FROM SENATOR MARCO 

3373
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:31,144
RUBIO WHO APPARENTLY HAS BEEN 

3374
01:37:31,144 --> 01:37:32,680
BRIEFED ON THE SITUATION.

3375
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,014
GEORGE, THIS IS A VERY GRIM 

3376
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:34,214
TWEET.

3377
01:37:34,214 --> 01:37:36,650
HE WRITES, JUST SPOKE TO BROWARD

3378
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:37,217
SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT.

3379
01:37:37,217 --> 01:37:37,851
TODAY IS THAT TERRIBLE DAY YOU 

3380
01:37:37,851 --> 01:37:39,920
PRAY NEVER COMES.

3381
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,755
>> IT HAS COME TO BROWARD 

3382
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:46,193
COUNTY, PARKLAND, FLORIDA.

3383
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:46,793
MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH 

3384
01:37:46,793 --> 01:37:47,027
SCHOOL.

3385
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:47,694
I WANT TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE 

3386
01:37:47,694 --> 01:37:51,198
STUDENTS, ZACHARY WELLS, AN ROTC

3387
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:52,599
STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL.

3388
01:37:52,599 --> 01:37:54,368
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WERE 

3389
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:55,402
ABLE TO SEE AND HEAR AND WHERE 

3390
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:55,869
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. 

3391
01:37:55,869 --> 01:38:04,078
>> YES, I WAS LEADING SOME KIDS 

3392
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:05,346
OUT FROM THE CLASSROOM.

3393
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:07,047
WE WERE HEADING OVER TOWARDS THE

3394
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,615
1300 BUILDING WHICH IS WHERE THE

3395
01:38:08,615 --> 01:38:09,149
SHOTS HAPPENED.

3396
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:12,786
I HEARD TWO OR THREE SHOTS, AND 

3397
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:14,621
SOME CUSTODY CAME UP SAYING TO 

3398
01:38:14,621 --> 01:38:16,256
GO THE OTHER WAY.

3399
01:38:16,256 --> 01:38:18,225
SO WE RAN BACK INTO OUR 

3400
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,193
CLASSROOM AND BARRICADED 

3401
01:38:20,193 --> 01:38:20,794
OURSELVES IN THERE.

3402
01:38:20,794 --> 01:38:21,962
THE POLICE EVENTUALLY CAME AND 

3403
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,630
GOT US AND NOW I'M OUT ON THE 

3404
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:26,567
STREET JUST TRYING TO GET HOME 

3405
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:26,767
SAFE. 

3406
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:27,901
>> HOW MANY SHOTS DID YOU HEAR 

3407
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:29,737
FIRED OR COULD YOU HEAR 

3408
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:30,437
ANYTHING?

3409
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:32,172
>> I HEARD TWO OR THREE SHOTS 

3410
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:36,276
AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE

3411
01:38:36,276 --> 01:38:37,211
FIREWORKS.

3412
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:40,114
I SAW THE CUSTODIANS AND THERE 

3413
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:40,948
WAS ONE KID A LITTLE FURTHER 

3414
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:41,715
AHEAD OF ME.

3415
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:43,583
I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE 

3416
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:45,119
FIREWORKS AT FIRST AND THEN 

3417
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,586
REALIZED THEY WERE GUNSHOTS.

3418
01:38:46,586 --> 01:38:48,155
EVERYONE SPRINTED BACK TO THE 

3419
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:49,290
CLASSROOM AND WE BARRICADED 

3420
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,390
OURSELVES BACK UP IN THERE. 

3421
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:52,125
>> AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WAS THE 

3422
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:53,660
SHOOTING CONTAINED TO THAT ONE 

3423
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:53,927
BUILDING?

3424
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:54,861
>> I BELIEVE IT STAYED IN THAT 

3425
01:38:54,861 --> 01:38:56,997
AREA, YES, AND THEN FROM WHAT I 

3426
01:38:56,997 --> 01:38:58,465
HEARD HE DROPPED HIS RIFLE AND 

3427
01:38:58,465 --> 01:38:59,733
HE MADE HIS WAY OUT WITH THE 

3428
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:01,668
OTHER STUDENTS THAT WERE BEING 

3429
01:39:01,668 --> 01:39:02,169
EVACUATED.

3430
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:05,739
HE WALKED OVER TO WYNDHAM LAKES 

3431
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:06,407
WHICH IS PRETTY NEAR.

3432
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:08,608
I LIVE IN WYNDHAM LAKES, AND HE 

3433
01:39:08,608 --> 01:39:10,577
WAS ARRESTED AT A COMMON LITTLE 

3434
01:39:10,577 --> 01:39:12,146
MUD HOLE THERE.

3435
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:14,281
IT'S A FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT 

3436
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:14,481
AREA.

3437
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:16,383
>> WE ACTUALLY SAW THE VIDEO OF 

3438
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:17,785
HIM BEING ARRESTED.

3439
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:19,086
WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO NAME THE 

3440
01:39:19,086 --> 01:39:20,854
SHOOTER JUST YET BUT YOU SAY YOU

3441
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:22,289
BELIEVE YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS, YOU

3442
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:23,624
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS FORMER

3443
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:23,957
STUDENT?

3444
01:39:23,957 --> 01:39:25,626
>> YES, I KNOW WHO IT WAS.

3445
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,262
WE GOT A PICTURE OF HIM AND WE 

3446
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:31,631
WERE ACTUALLY SENDING IT AROUND 

3447
01:39:31,631 --> 01:39:37,171
TO THE DIFFERENT OFFICERS TO TRY

3448
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:38,405
AND GET THE PHOTO OUT TO THEM 

3449
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:43,310
AND GET HIM APPREHENDED FAIRLY 

3450
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:43,543
QUICK. 

3451
01:39:43,543 --> 01:39:44,378
>> YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM 

3452
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:45,646
WITH THE GUN IN HIS HAND?

3453
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:46,680
>> NO.

3454
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,914
WE HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM, A 

3455
01:39:47,914 --> 01:39:49,349
COMPOSITE PHOTO FROM A PREVIOUS 

3456
01:39:49,349 --> 01:39:51,819
YEAR THAT HE WAS IN FROM BEING 

3457
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:52,186
AT THE SCHOOL. 

3458
01:39:52,186 --> 01:39:56,156
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS THAT 

3459
01:39:56,156 --> 01:39:59,726
PERSON?

3460
01:39:59,726 --> 01:40:01,962
>> ONE OF THE KIDS IN THE CLASS,

3461
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:03,497
COLTON HATCH, WAS ON THE PHONE 

3462
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:04,698
WITH ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS 

3463
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:07,667
AND HE GAVE INFORMATION OF HIS 

3464
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:08,334
NAME AND WE LOOKED FOR HIS NAME 

3465
01:40:08,334 --> 01:40:09,837
AND FOUND A VERY SIMILAR ONE AND

3466
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,806

01:40:13,573 --> 01:40:14,774
IT OUT TO THE OFFICERS. 

3469
01:40:14,774 --> 01:40:15,676
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS 

3470
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:19,580
FORMER STUDENT PERSONALLY?

3471
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,348
>> I DID NOT KNOW HIM 

3472
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:21,882
PERSONALLY.

3473
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:23,049
I HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE BUT I HAD 

3474
01:40:23,049 --> 01:40:24,350
NOT TALKED TO HIM OR REALLY 

3475
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:25,152
KNOWN HIM AT ALL.

3476
01:40:25,152 --> 01:40:29,556
>> SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW HUMUCH ABT

3477
01:40:29,556 --> 01:40:29,990
HIM?

3478
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:31,425
>> I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM.

3479
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:33,160
ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID HE USED 

3480
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,594
TO FOLLOW HIM ON A SOCIAL MEDIA 

3481
01:40:34,594 --> 01:40:37,064
ACCOUNT WHERE HE WOULD REGULARLY

3482
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:38,832
POST VIDEOS OF HIM WITH GUNS AND

3483
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:39,967
KNIVES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 

3484
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:42,903
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM OTHERS 

3485
01:40:42,903 --> 01:40:44,504
AS WELL, FROM MATTHEW WALKER, 

3486
01:40:44,504 --> 01:40:46,106
ANOTHER STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL.

3487
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:48,308
TO EMPHASIZE, AS FAR AS YOU 

3488
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:49,009
KNOW, THIS IS A FORMER STUDENT 

3489
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:49,609
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL?

3490
01:40:49,609 --> 01:40:52,612
>> YES, HE WAS A FORMER STUDENT.

3491
01:40:52,612 --> 01:40:54,515
ONE OF MY TEACHERS SAID 

3492
01:40:54,515 --> 01:40:55,849
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM EITHER 

3493
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:56,617
TRANSFERRING OR BEING KICKED OUT

3494
01:40:56,617 --> 01:40:57,484
OF THE SCHOOL.

3495
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:59,019
I'M NOT SURE WHICH IT WAS, BUT 

3496
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,754
YES, HE DID USED TO GO TO OUR 

3497
01:41:00,754 --> 01:41:01,021
SCHOOL.

3498
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:02,689
>> ZACHARY WELLS, THANKS VERY 

3499
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:03,891
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

3500
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,492
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

3501
01:41:05,492 --> 01:41:07,961
BRAD GARRETT, I WANT TO GO BACK

3505
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:17,337
LET'S LISTEN.

3506
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:20,274
>> I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING

3507
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:23,977
THIS IS A CATASTROPHIC, AN 

3508
01:41:23,977 --> 01:41:25,746
UNBELIEVABLY CATASTROPHIC DAY IN

3509
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:26,412
BROWARD COUNTY HISTORY.

3510
01:41:26,412 --> 01:41:27,013
IT'S DEVASTATING.

3511
01:41:27,013 --> 01:41:31,652
I'M SICK TO MY STOMACH.

3512
01:41:31,652 --> 01:41:35,255
WE HAVE MULTIPLE CASUALTIES.

3513
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:37,290
WE'VE HAD APPROXIMATELY 14 

3514
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,626
PEOPLE TRANSPORTED TO AREA 

3515
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:42,862
HOSPITALS WITH VARYING DEGREES 

3516
01:41:42,862 --> 01:41:43,764
OF INJURIES.

3517
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,399
THERE ARE MULTIPLE CASUALTIES 

3518
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:45,699
THOUGH.

3519
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:46,466
THERE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE LOST 

3520
01:41:46,466 --> 01:41:47,167
THEIR LIVES.

3521
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,569
I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER RIGHT 

3522
01:41:48,569 --> 01:41:48,969
NOW.

3523
01:41:48,969 --> 01:41:52,272
IT'S A FLUID SCENE RIGHT NOW.

3524
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:53,473
WE HAVE MULTIPLE S.W.A.T. TEAMS 

3525
01:41:53,473 --> 01:41:54,841
CLEARING ALL THE BUILDINGS.

3526
01:41:54,841 --> 01:41:56,677
IF ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT 

3527
01:41:56,677 --> 01:41:57,477
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL, 

3528
01:41:57,477 --> 01:41:58,945
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCHOOLS 

3529
01:41:58,945 --> 01:41:59,613
IN BROWARD COUNTY.

3530
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:02,649
IT'S HUGE.

3531
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:03,317
IT'S A HUGE CAMPUS.

3532
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:04,985
WE HAVE MULTIPLE S.W.A.T. TEAMS 

3533
01:42:04,985 --> 01:42:05,985
CLEARING EVERY BUILDING TO MAKE 

3534
01:42:05,985 --> 01:42:09,822
SURE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER 

3535
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:10,123
SHOOTERS.

3536
01:42:10,123 --> 01:42:13,427
WE HAVE A SHOOTER IN CUSTODY.

3537
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:15,262
HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY I 

3538
01:42:15,262 --> 01:42:17,163
BELIEVE ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER HE 

3539
01:42:17,163 --> 01:42:20,767
LEFT STONEMAN DOUGLAS, AFTER HE 

3540
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,135
COMMITTED THIS HORRIFIC 

3541
01:42:22,135 --> 01:42:26,106
HOMICIDAL DETESTABLE ACT.

3542
01:42:26,106 --> 01:42:31,578

PEOPLE ARE ON THE SCENE OF THIS 

3544
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:35,982
HORRIFIC SCENE AS FAR AS THE 

3545
01:42:35,982 --> 01:42:36,549
BUILDINGS ARE CLEARED.

3546
01:42:36,549 --> 01:42:38,018
RIGHT NOW THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT 

3547
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:38,785
SAFE TO BE CLEARED.

3548
01:42:38,785 --> 01:42:40,921
WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU PUT OUT ON

3549
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:45,058

COMPLEX.

3554
01:42:54,935 --> 01:42:55,835
OUR DEPUTIES AND OTHER POLICE 

3555
01:42:55,835 --> 01:42:57,537

3556
01:42:57,537 --> 01:43:00,607

BAY TO BE REUNITED WITH THEIR 

3558
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:03,043
PARENTS.

3559
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:03,677
THAT'S WHERE WE WANT PARENTS TO 

3560
01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:07,314
GO.

3561
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:09,783
I WANT TO THANK MAYOR DEAN,

IS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR PARKLAND, 

3568

BROWARD COUNTY, STATE OF FLORIDA

3569
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:26,400
AND THE UNITED STATES.

3570
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,368
MY VERY OWN TRIPLETS WENT TO

01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:30,370
THAT SCHOOL AND GRADUATED FROM 

3572
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,405
STONEMAN DOUGLAS.

3573
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,605
THEY PLAYED FOOTBALL AND 

3574
01:43:32,605 --> 01:43:36,276
LACROSSE AT THAT SCHOOL, SO IT'S

3575
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:37,010
JUST CATASTROPHIC.

3576
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:40,480
THERE REALLY ARE NO WORDS, AND 

3577
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,449
WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED.

3578
01:43:42,449 --> 01:43:43,483
HAVE SPOKEN TO GOVERNOR SCOTT.

3579
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:44,117
HE'S OUT OF STATE.

3580
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:46,286
HE'S ON HIS WAY OVER HERE.

3581
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:47,554
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP

3582
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:48,421

TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS.

3585
01:43:51,257 --> 01:43:56,830
ANY QUESTIONS?

3586
01:43:56,830 --> 01:44:01,167
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

3587
01:44:01,167 --> 01:44:02,235

3588
01:44:02,235 --> 01:44:03,136
>> HE WAS FOUND OFF CAMPUS.

3589
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:04,604
 I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE.

3590
01:44:04,604 --> 01:44:06,739
I BELIEVE HE WAS FOUND IN THE 

3591
01:44:06,739 --> 01:44:08,942
CITY OF HALL SPRINGS BY A 

3592

>> I CAN'T.

3597
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:16,149
>> WAS HE AN OUTSIDER?

3598
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:18,084
>> FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THERE

3599
01:44:18,084 --> 01:44:20,620
WAS A TIME WHERE HE DID ATTEND 

3600
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,154
THIS SCHOOL.

3601
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:24,391
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE LEFT.

3602
01:44:24,391 --> 01:44:25,859
I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE LEFT.

3603
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:26,392
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

3604
01:44:26,392 --> 01:44:28,061
THAT IS CORRECT, HE'S NOT A 

3605
01:44:28,061 --> 01:44:28,461
CURRENT STUDENT. 

3606
01:44:28,461 --> 01:44:30,530
>> WAS THERE ANY CONFRONTATION 

3607
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:31,064
BETWEEN HIM AND POLICE?

3608

>> I WASN'T THERE BUT I WAS TOLD

3609
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:33,833
THERE WAS NO CONFRONTATION.

3610
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:39,139
HE WAS -- CAN YOU HEAR ME?

3611
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:41,041
HE WAS TAKEN INTO ARREST WITHOUT

3612
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:41,308
INCIDENT.

3613
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:41,808
YES.

3614
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:43,143
>> DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN 

3615
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:43,577
CUSTODY?

3616
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:44,277
>> NO.

3617
01:44:44,277 --> 01:44:44,443
ONE.

3618
01:44:44,443 --> 01:44:44,878
>> OKAY.

3619
01:44:44,878 --> 01:44:46,146
DO YOU HAVE AN AGE ON HIM?

3620

18 YEARS OLD. 

3622
01:44:48,415 --> 01:44:50,183
>> OKAY.

3623
01:44:50,183 --> 01:44:51,151
THEN AT LEAST ONE DEAD?

3624
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:51,784
>> MULTIPLE. 

3625
01:44:51,784 --> 01:44:52,319
>> MULTIPLE.

3626
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:52,786
MORE THAN ONE?

3627
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:54,221
>> YOU SAID THE SCHOOL IS NOT 

3628
01:44:54,221 --> 01:44:55,222
SAFE RIGHT NOW.

3629
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:57,490
ARE THERE STILL CHILDREN INSIDE?

3630
01:44:57,490 --> 01:44:57,957
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

3631
01:44:57,957 --> 01:44:59,159

3634
01:45:02,929 --> 01:45:04,531
KNOW ABOUT ARE CLEARED AND ARE 

3635
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:05,632
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.

3636
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,133
HOWEVER, WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE 

3637
01:45:07,133 --> 01:45:08,034
ARE INJURED PEOPLE.

3638
01:45:08,034 --> 01:45:09,102
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE 

3639
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:09,603
PEOPLE HIDING.

3640
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:09,970
WE DON'T KNOW.

3641
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:16,509
SO WE WILL NOT BEGIN TO RELEASE 

3642
01:45:16,509 --> 01:45:18,011
INFORMATION OR BEGIN TO OPEN UP 

3643
01:45:18,011 --> 01:45:19,646
THE CRIME SCENE UNTIL THE 

3644
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:20,246
S.W.A.T. COMPONENTS SAY THE 

3645
01:45:20,246 --> 01:45:21,481
SCHOOL IS SAFE AND CLEAR.

3646
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:22,816
WHEN I HEAR ALL CLEAR, WE'LL 

3647
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:25,485
BEGIN THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS 

3648
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:25,852
INVESTIGATION. 

3649
01:45:25,852 --> 01:45:27,320
>> ARE ANY TEACHERS DEAD OR ONLY

3650
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:27,587
STUDENTS?

3651
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:28,755
>> I HAVE NO IDEA. 

3652
01:45:28,755 --> 01:45:30,757
>> HAVE YOU HEARD OF MR. -- 

3653
01:45:30,757 --> 01:45:31,257
>> NO -- 

3654
01:45:31,257 --> 01:45:32,759
>> INJURIES, APPROXIMATELY HOW 

3655
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:32,959
MANY?

3656
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:34,360
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY 

3657
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:35,562
INJURIES THERE WERE.

3658
01:45:35,562 --> 01:45:36,863
WE KNOW 14 PEOPLE WERE 

3659
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:38,498
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITALS 

3660
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:41,234
WITH VARYING DEGREES OF WOUNDS.

3661
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:42,302
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL WAIT FOR 

3662
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:43,703
THE SCHOOL TO BE CLEARED.

3663
01:45:43,703 --> 01:45:46,139
WE'LL GO ON TO THE NEXT PHASE.

3664
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:46,907
I KNOW THIS IS CRITICALLY 

3665
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:47,974

KEEP YOU UP TO DATE, BUT FOR

3669
01:45:52,078 --> 01:45:52,511
INFORMATION ON -- 

3670
01:45:52,511 --> 01:45:54,981

>> HE WAS OUTSIDE AND INSIDE AT 

3674
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:06,760
VARYING TIMES.

3675
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,461
HE CERTAINLY WAS INSIDE. 

3676
01:46:08,461 --> 01:46:09,328
>> THERE'S SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL 

3677
01:46:09,328 --> 01:46:11,331

3678
01:46:11,331 --> 01:46:12,398

DON'T HAVE A CONFIRMED NUMBER.

3689
01:46:31,484 --> 01:46:35,889
A SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.

3690
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:36,489
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY OUTSIDE OF 

3691
01:46:36,489 --> 01:46:37,123
THE SCHOOL WITHOUT INCIDENT.

3692
01:46:37,123 --> 01:46:38,191
WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL 

3693
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:39,159
ACCORDING TO ONE EYEWITNESS 

3694
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:39,693

3697
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:46,866
ONE OF THE THINGS WE JUST HEARD 

3698
01:46:46,866 --> 01:46:48,268
FROM THE SHERIFF IS THAT THE 

3699
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:49,368
SHERIFF DIDN'T KNOW YET WHETHER 

3700
01:46:49,368 --> 01:46:51,171
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL, VICTOR, HAD 

3701
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:51,504
BEEN CLEARED.

3702
01:46:51,504 --> 01:46:52,305
IS THERE STILL ACTIVITY, DO YOU 

3703
01:46:52,305 --> 01:46:55,942
STILL SEE STUDENTS COMING OUT OF

3704
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:56,242
THE SCHOOL?

3705
01:46:56,242 --> 01:46:57,210
>> Reporter: GEORGE, EVERY 

3706
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,044
SINGLE MINUTE WE'RE SEEING MORE 

3707
01:46:58,044 --> 01:46:59,312
AND MORE STUDENTS MAKING THEIR

01:46:59,312 --> 01:47:02,816

01:47:02,816 --> 01:47:03,683
SHOULDER, B MAY HAVE BEEN 

3710
01:47:03,683 --> 01:47:04,851
STUDENTS AS WELL.

3711
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:07,153
THIS SCENE HERE RIGHT NOW IS 

3712
01:47:07,153 --> 01:47:07,487
STILL MASSIVE.

3713
01:47:07,487 --> 01:47:07,988
HUGE POLICE PRESENCE.

3714
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:09,122
YOU GOT A LOT OF STUDENTS MAKING

3715
01:47:09,122 --> 01:47:09,956
THEIR WAY OUT.

3716
01:47:09,956 --> 01:47:11,424
A LOT OF VERY CONCERNED PARENTS.

3717
01:47:11,424 --> 01:47:12,259
ALMOST EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, 

3718
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:14,327
PEOPLE ON THEIR CELL PHONES 

3719
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:16,296
DESPERATE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH 

3720
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:17,129
THEIR SONS OR DAUGHTERS.

3721
01:47:17,129 --> 01:47:19,432
THE SCENE BEHIND ME, THE SCHOOL,

3722
01:47:19,432 --> 01:47:20,933
IT IS JUST ABOUT A FEW BLOCKS 

3723
01:47:20,933 --> 01:47:21,568
THAT WAY.

3724
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:22,735
I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE THE 

3725
01:47:22,735 --> 01:47:23,536
FLASHING LIGHTS.

3726
01:47:23,536 --> 01:47:24,304
THERE ARE STILL HELICOPTERS UP 

3727
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:25,338

COULDN'T GIVE US AN EXACT NUMBER

3732
01:47:30,877 --> 01:47:31,244
ON THAT.

3733
01:47:31,244 --> 01:47:32,311
AT LEAST 14 PEOPLE TRANSPORTED

01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:36,983
THIS SCHOOL, GEORGE, IT IS 

3737
01:47:36,983 --> 01:47:37,484
MASSIVE.

3738
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:38,317
IT IS A HUGE SCHOOL.

3739
01:47:38,317 --> 01:47:40,921
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR

3740
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:42,255
AUTHORITIES TO GO STEP-BY-STEP 

3741
01:47:42,255 --> 01:47:43,089
INTO EVERY SINGLE CLASSROOM TO 

3742
01:47:43,089 --> 01:47:45,258
MAKE SURE THE SCENE IS TOTALLY 

3743
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:45,491
SECURE. 

3744
01:47:45,491 --> 01:47:48,027

AS WE SAID, WE HAVE BEEN GETTING

3749
01:47:53,833 --> 01:47:55,769
REPORTS ALL DAY LONG FROM 

3750
01:47:55,769 --> 01:47:56,369
STUDENTS AND PARENTS ON THE 

3751
01:47:56,369 --> 01:47:57,437
SCENE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT 

3752
01:47:57,437 --> 01:47:58,872

MULTIPLE FATALITIES.

3757
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:06,779
WE'VE ALSO GOTTEN VIDEO FROM 

3758
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:08,815
INSIDE THE SCHOOL OF THE MOMENTS

3759
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:09,983
WHEN THE SHOOTING UNFOLDED.

3760
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:17,324
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

3761
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:23,463
>> OH, MY GOD.

3762
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:25,999
>> WELL OVER A DOZEN SHOTS THERE

3763
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:26,933
IN ABOUT 10, 15 SECONDS.

3764
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:29,202
JUST A TERRIFYING SCENE INSIDE 

3765
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:30,370
THAT CLASSROOM.

3766
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:33,139
WE SPOKE WITH MATTHEW WALKER WHO

3767
01:48:33,139 --> 01:48:34,107
WAS INSIDE THAT CLASSROOM.

3768
01:48:34,107 --> 01:48:36,109
WAS SAID SOME OF HIS CLASSMATES 

3769
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:37,477
WERE INJURED.

3770
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:38,211
PERHAPS ONE SERIOUSLY.

3771
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:39,946
BUT THERE WERE NO FATALITIES 

3772
01:48:39,946 --> 01:48:40,747
INSIDE THE CLASSROOM.

3773
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:42,782
THE GUNMAN GOING DOOR TO DOOR 

3774
01:48:42,782 --> 01:48:44,884
FINDING LOCKED DOORS BUT ABLE TO

3775
01:48:44,884 --> 01:48:46,252
SQUEEZE OUT MORE SHOTS THAN ONE 

3776
01:48:46,252 --> 01:48:47,587
COULD COUNT ACCORDING TO ANOTHER

3777
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:50,223
EYEWITNESS ON THE SCENE.

3778
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:50,456
MICHAEL.

3779
01:48:50,456 --> 01:48:55,528
OF COURSE, FOUR TO SIX MINUTES.

3780
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:56,829
TOM, THE WORK IS BEING DONE TO 

3781
01:48:56,829 --> 01:48:58,331
FIND OUT WHAT TRIGGERED THIS 

3782
01:48:58,331 --> 01:48:58,598
SHOOTING. 

3783
01:48:58,598 --> 01:48:58,998
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

3784
01:48:58,998 --> 01:49:00,266
WE'RE SEEING A DIFFERENT PATTERN

3785
01:49:00,266 --> 01:49:01,500
JUST FROM THE LAST EYEWITNESS 

3786
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,803
YOU INTERVIEWED, THAT STUDENT, 

3787
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:04,838
FROM WHAT THE BROWARD SHERIFF 

3788
01:49:04,838 --> 01:49:06,139
TOLD US AND A LAW ENFORCEMENT 

3789
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:07,641
SOURCE TOLD ME EARLIER IN THIS 

3790
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:08,275
INVESTIGATION, APPARENTLY THE 

3791
01:49:08,275 --> 01:49:09,542
SHOOTER WAS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

3792
01:49:09,542 --> 01:49:10,143
WE KNOW THAT.

3793
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:11,411
HE STARTS FIRING.

3794
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:13,513
AND THEN AT SOME POINT, AND THIS

3795
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:14,580
ACCORDING TO THE THREE PEOPLE I 

3796
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,115
JUST MENTIONED, HE SOMEHOW 

3797
01:49:16,115 --> 01:49:18,118
BLENDS IN ON THE WAY OUT AS 

3798
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:19,052
PEOPLE ARE EVACUATING AND LATER 

3799
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:21,588
HE'S ARRESTED IN A NEARBY 

3800
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:21,921
NEIGHBORHOOD.

3801
01:49:21,921 --> 01:49:24,591
SO HE USED, I GUESS HIS YOUTHFUL

3802
01:49:24,591 --> 01:49:25,658
APPEARANCE IN SOME REGARDS TO 

3803
01:49:25,658 --> 01:49:27,059
MIX IN WITH THE OTHER STUDENTS.

3804
01:49:27,059 --> 01:49:28,261
WE KNOW HE WAS A FORMER STUDENT.

3805
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:30,430
TO TRY TO ESCAPE.

3806
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:30,997
EVENTUALLY WAS COST. 

3807
01:49:30,997 --> 01:49:32,465
>> BRAD GARRETT, FORMER FBI 

3808
01:49:32,465 --> 01:49:34,767
SPECIAL AGENT, WE TALKED ABOUT 

3809
01:49:34,767 --> 01:49:35,969
THIS BEFORE, THIS DOES NOT FIT 

3810
01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:40,072
WHAT HAS BEEN THE NORMAL PROFILE

3811
01:49:40,072 --> 01:49:42,042
FOR STUHOOTINGS LIKE THIS.

3812
01:49:42,042 --> 01:49:42,909
THE STUDENT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

3813
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:44,277
A WAY TO ESCAPE. 

3814
01:49:44,277 --> 01:49:44,777
>> THAT'S TRUE, GEORGE.

3815
01:49:44,777 --> 01:49:47,013
IT SORT OF TELLS YOU A COUPLE OF

3816
01:49:47,013 --> 01:49:47,246
THINGS.

3817
01:49:47,246 --> 01:49:48,214
THAT -- I THINK WE HEARD THIS 

3818
01:49:48,214 --> 01:49:51,151
EARLIER -- THAT THEIR RESPONSE 

3819
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:54,287
TIME WAS 20, 25 MINUTES.

3820
01:49:54,354 --> 01:49:55,120
THE SHOOTING SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS 

3821
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,056
FOUR TO SIX MINUTES SO FOR 

3822
01:49:57,056 --> 01:49:58,257
WHATEVER REASON, HE CHOSE TO 

3823
01:49:58,257 --> 01:49:59,859
LEAVE MAYBE AS SOME STUDENTS 

3824
01:49:59,859 --> 01:50:02,128
STARTED TO RUN, BUT IT DOES GO 

3825
01:50:02,128 --> 01:50:04,197
TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN HIS HEAD.

3826
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:05,799
HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT WANT TO DIE

3827
01:50:05,799 --> 01:50:07,400
THAT DAY AND SAW AN AVENUE TO 

3828
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:11,071
ESCAPE AND TOOK IT.

3829
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:12,806
SO I THINK WE'LL STILL HAVE TO 

3830
01:50:12,806 --> 01:50:14,641
FIGURE THIS OUT, BUT THE -- GO 

3831
01:50:14,641 --> 01:50:14,874
AHEAD. 

3832
01:50:14,874 --> 01:50:15,741
>> ALTHOUGH, BRAD, I THINK -- 

3833
01:50:15,741 --> 01:50:17,910
I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE I DON'T 

3834
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:18,945
CONFUSE THIS WITH ANOTHER SCENE.

3835
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:21,080
I THINK THE AURORA SHOOTING, 

3836
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:23,083
THERE WAS A CONCERN THEN, THE 

3837
01:50:23,083 --> 01:50:24,317
SHOOTER TRIED TO LEAVE AS WELL.

3838
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:26,686
THAT WAS, PERHAPS, TO PERPETRATE

3839
01:50:26,686 --> 01:50:27,453
MOOR VIOLENCE. 

3840
01:50:27,453 --> 01:50:28,388
>> WELL, MAYBE, BUT HE COULD 

3841
01:50:28,388 --> 01:50:29,923
HAVE SHOT THAT POLICE OFFICER.

3842
01:50:29,923 --> 01:50:32,258
YOU KNOW, HOMES COULD HAVE 

3843
01:50:32,258 --> 01:50:33,292
EASILY GOTTEN INTO A GUN BATTLE 

3844
01:50:33,292 --> 01:50:38,865
WITH THE OFFICERS AT THE BACK 

3845
01:50:38,865 --> 01:50:39,499
DOOR OF THAT THEATER WHERE HIS 

3846
01:50:39,499 --> 01:50:40,166
CAR WAS PARKED AND HE EXITED AND

3847
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:41,301
CHOSE NOT TO.

3848
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:42,769
AGAIN, WE CAN'T STEREOTYPE THESE

3849
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:43,903
SHOOTERS TOO MUCH AS TO WHAT'S 

3850
01:50:43,903 --> 01:50:47,673
GOING ON IN THEIR HEAD, MAYBE 

3851
01:50:47,673 --> 01:50:49,408
THE MOTIVATORS MAY BE SIMILAR 

3852
01:50:49,408 --> 01:50:52,512
BUT THE END RESULT MAYBE NOT SO 

3853
01:50:52,512 --> 01:50:52,946
MUCH.

3854
01:50:52,946 --> 01:50:54,147
AGAIN, MOST THE TIME WE SEE THEM

3855
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:56,048
TAKING THEIR LIVES OR FORCING 

3856
01:50:56,048 --> 01:50:59,285
THE POLICE TO KILL THEM, BUT HE 

3857
01:50:59,285 --> 01:50:59,919
CLEARLY DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT. 

3858
01:50:59,919 --> 01:51:02,722
>> MUCH MORE TO LEARN FROM THE 

3859
01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:02,922
SCENE.

3860
01:51:02,922 --> 01:51:04,124
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THIS 

3861
01:51:04,124 --> 01:51:06,192
CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF 

3862
01:51:06,192 --> 01:51:06,592
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

3863
01:51:06,592 --> 01:51:07,927
>> OH, IT CERTAINLY HAS, GEORGE.

3864
01:51:07,927 --> 01:51:09,929
WE KNOW NOW HE'S SPOKEN WITH 

3865
01:51:09,929 --> 01:51:10,663
FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR, SPOKENEN 

3866
01:51:10,663 --> 01:51:11,230
WITH THE SHERIFF DOWN THERE.

3867
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:12,832
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SUPPOSED TO 

3868
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:14,601
HAVE A BRIEFING WITH PRESS 

3869
01:51:14,601 --> 01:51:15,235
SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS OVER AN 

3870
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:16,736
HOUR AGO.

3871
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,371
THEY DID CANCEL THAT.

3872
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:20,106
I'M TOLD BY MY COLLEAGUES WHO 

3873
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:21,207
ARE WORKING WITH ME AT THE WHITE

3874
01:51:21,207 --> 01:51:22,742
HOUSE THAT REPORTERS WERE 

3875
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:25,645
GATHERED OUTSIDE SARAH SANDERS' 

3876
01:51:25,645 --> 01:51:26,679
OFFICE NOT LONG ASK TRYING TO 

3877
01:51:26,679 --> 01:51:29,616
ASK HER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEWS

3878
01:51:29,616 --> 01:51:30,850
OF DAY BECAUSE THE BRIEFING WAS 

3879
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:31,284
CANCELED.

3880
01:51:31,284 --> 01:51:32,718
SHE WENT BACK IN HER OFFICE, 

3881
01:51:32,718 --> 01:51:34,387
CLOSED HER DOOR AND SAID WE'RE 

3882
01:51:34,387 --> 01:51:35,087
STRICTLY FOCUSED ON THE 

3883
01:51:35,087 --> 01:51:35,421
SHOOTING.

3884
01:51:35,421 --> 01:51:36,489
THAT'S THE GUIDING FORCE OF 

3885
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:37,390
WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE 

3886
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:38,725
SCENES HERE AT THIS WHITE HOUSE.

3887
01:51:38,725 --> 01:51:40,226
WE DID SEE SOME TWEETS FROM 

3888
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:43,096
PRESIDENT TRUMP, OF COURSE, 

3889
01:51:43,096 --> 01:51:44,631
EXPRESSING HIS CONDOLENCES AND 

3890
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:45,465
OFFERED ALL THE FEDERAL 

3891
01:51:45,465 --> 01:51:46,766
ASSISTANCE THAT FLORIDA MIGHT 

3892
01:51:46,766 --> 01:51:48,268
NEED IN THOSE PHONE 

3893
01:51:48,268 --> 01:51:48,902
CONVERSATIONS HE HAS HAD HERE AT

3894
01:51:48,902 --> 01:51:49,836
THE WHITE HOUSE.

3895
01:51:49,836 --> 01:51:51,171
AND I ALSO WANT TO BRING YOUR 

3896
01:51:51,171 --> 01:51:51,971
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S BEEN 

3897
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:53,072
HAPPENING OVER ON CAPITOL HILL.

3898
01:51:53,072 --> 01:51:54,907
WE HAVE SEEN SOME, AND HEARD 

3899
01:51:54,907 --> 01:51:56,976
SOME VERY EMOTIONAL REACTION, 

3900
01:51:56,976 --> 01:51:58,745
PARTICULARLY FROM THE FLORIDA 

3901
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:00,046
DELEGATION, TOM, NOT THAT LONG 

3902
01:52:00,046 --> 01:52:01,481
AGO, MENTIONED THAT TWEET FROM 

3903
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:03,182
FLORIDA, SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, 

3904
01:52:03,182 --> 01:52:06,586
AND PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST 

3905
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:07,220
ATTENTION-GRABBING MOMENTS WE'VE

3906
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,254
SEEN ON THE CAPITOL IN THE LAST 

3907
01:52:08,254 --> 01:52:12,058
COUPLE OF HOURS IS FROM THE 

3908
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:12,759
CONNECTICUT SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY

3909
01:52:12,759 --> 01:52:14,661
WHO IS FROM THE AREA WHERE THE 

3910
01:52:14,661 --> 01:52:15,795
SANDY HOOK SHOOTING OCCURRED AND

3911
01:52:15,795 --> 01:52:17,197
HE WAS ON THE SENATE FLOOR 

3912
01:52:17,197 --> 01:52:19,631
TODAY, GEORGE, HE TOLD AMERICA, 

3913
01:52:19,631 --> 01:52:20,265
TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION, AND YOU

3914
01:52:20,265 --> 01:52:23,836
WILL SEE CHILDREN RUNNING FOR 

3915
01:52:23,836 --> 01:52:25,038
THEIR LIVES.

3916
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:25,972
THIS HAPPENS NOWHERE OTHER THAN 

3917
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:26,506
IN THE UNITED STATES.

3918
01:52:26,506 --> 01:52:27,440
THAT IS THE WORD FROM THIS CITY 

3919
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,308
RIGHT NOW, GEORGE. 

3920
01:52:29,308 --> 01:52:29,909
>> THAT'S THE WORD FROM 

3921
01:52:29,909 --> 01:52:31,410
WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW, CECILIA, 

3922
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:32,811
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH SO MANY 

3923
01:52:32,811 --> 01:52:34,413
OF THESE SHOOTINGS IN THE PAST, 

3924
01:52:34,413 --> 01:52:36,983
DESPITE A LOT OF RHETORIC IN THE

3925
01:52:36,983 --> 01:52:38,418
HOURS AND DAYS AFTER THE 

3926
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:39,919
SHOOTINGS, NOT MUCH HAPPENS IN 

3927
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:40,820
THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOW.

3928
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:42,589
>> YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT 

3929
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:45,158
THIS SO MANY TIMES IN SITUATIONS

3930
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:48,027
JUST LIKE THIS.

3931
01:52:48,027 --> 01:52:49,562
FROM THAT SHOOTING THAT TOOK 

3932
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:50,763
PLACE HERE ON THE BASEBALL 

3933
01:52:50,763 --> 01:52:52,031
DIAMOND AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 

3934
01:52:52,031 --> 01:52:54,433
WERE PLAYING AND IN THE DAYS -- 

3935
01:52:54,433 --> 01:52:56,502
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF 

3936
01:52:56,502 --> 01:52:57,903
THAT, TWEETS FROM MEMBERS OF 

3937
01:52:57,903 --> 01:53:00,874
CONGRESS AND FROM PRESIDENT, NO 

3938
01:53:00,874 --> 01:53:02,942
MATTER THE ADMINISTRATION, 

3939
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:05,078
CALLING FOR AN END TO THESE 

3940
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:05,678
HORRIFIC ACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE 

3941
01:53:05,678 --> 01:53:06,546
THEN THE FIGHTS BREAK OUT AND 

3942
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:07,413
THE DEBATES OVER GUN CONTROL 

3943
01:53:07,413 --> 01:53:09,382
HAPPEN AND THE DEBATES OVER 

3944
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:10,483
HEALTH CARE, MENTAL HEALTH CARE 

3945
01:53:10,483 --> 01:53:12,051
HAPPEN AND IT IS THE SAME DEBATE

3946
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:14,020
THAT WE HAVE HAD FOR YEARS AND 

3947
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,522
YEARS AND YEARS NOW AND YET WE 

3948
01:53:16,522 --> 01:53:18,157
KEEP SEEING HORRIFIC INCIDENTS 

3949
01:53:18,157 --> 01:53:19,559
LIKE THE ONE THAT WE ARE 

3950
01:53:19,559 --> 01:53:20,993
WATCHING ON OUR SCREENS AT THIS 

3951
01:53:20,993 --> 01:53:22,495
VERY MOMENT AND, GEORGE, I DON'T

3952
01:53:22,495 --> 01:53:23,729
KNOW THAT ANYONE IN THIS CITY 

3953
01:53:23,729 --> 01:53:25,898
KNOWS WHAT THE SOLUTION IS. 

3954
01:53:25,898 --> 01:53:26,933
>> FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE 

3955
01:53:26,933 --> 01:53:28,634
COMMISSIONER, THANK YOU, CECILIA

3956
01:53:28,634 --> 01:53:31,337
RAY KELLY WITH US.

3957
01:53:31,337 --> 01:53:31,905
YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN LAW 

3958
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:32,405
ENFORCEMENT FOR DECADES.

3959
01:53:32,405 --> 01:53:33,639
TALK ABOUT HOW THE EVOLUTION OF 

3960
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:35,942
THESE SHOOTINGS OVER YOUR TIME 

3961
01:53:35,942 --> 01:53:36,409
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

3962
01:53:36,409 --> 01:53:38,378
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST SCHOOL 

3963
01:53:38,378 --> 01:53:40,246
SHOOTING, THE ONE THAT HAD THE 

3964
01:53:40,246 --> 01:53:42,381
MOST IMPACT WAS THE COLUMBINE 

3965
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:45,184
SHOOTING IN 1999.

3966
01:53:45,184 --> 01:53:46,752
DEVON KLEBOLD AND ERIC HARRIS 

3967
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:49,022
KILLED 13 I THINK AND WOUNDED 

3968
01:53:49,022 --> 01:53:49,188
24.

3969
01:53:49,188 --> 01:53:50,657
LAW ENFORCEMENT LEARNED A BIG 

3970
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:53,693
LESSON FROM THAT SHOOTING.

3971
01:53:53,693 --> 01:53:55,428
THEY HESITATED GOING IN BECAUSE 

3972
01:53:55,428 --> 01:53:57,030
THE SORT OF THE TACTIC OF THE 

3973
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,265
DAY AT THE TIME WAS TO WAIT FOR 

3974
01:53:59,265 --> 01:53:59,832
A SPECIAL TEAM.

3975
01:53:59,832 --> 01:54:02,335
A S.W.A.T. TEAM TO GO IN AND 

3976
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:03,169
SEARCH FOR SHOOTERS.

3977
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:05,237
IN THE MEANTIME, PEOPLE WERE 

3978
01:54:05,237 --> 01:54:06,973
BEING KILLED, AND LAW 

3979
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:08,207
ENFORCEMENT CAME TO THE 

3980
01:54:08,207 --> 01:54:09,575
CONCLUSION, HEY, WE CAN'T DO 

3981
01:54:09,575 --> 01:54:10,310
THIS ANYMORE.

3982
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,110
>> MOVE FAST. 

3983
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:11,643
>> RIGHT, EXACTLY.

3984
01:54:11,643 --> 01:54:15,448
SO THAT WAS A SEA CHANGE.

3985
01:54:15,448 --> 01:54:17,750
AND YOU SEE THE TRAINING THAT 

3986
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:19,452
TOOK PLACE AFTER THAT, YOU SEE 

3987
01:54:19,452 --> 01:54:20,386
THE IMPACT OF THE TRAINING EVEN 

3988
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:20,586
TODAY.

3989
01:54:20,586 --> 01:54:23,889
SO IT'S ABOUT LIFE SAFETY, IT'S 

3990
01:54:23,889 --> 01:54:26,326
ABOUT MOVING QUICKLY TO THE 

3991
01:54:26,326 --> 01:54:26,593
SHOOTING.

3992
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:28,428
