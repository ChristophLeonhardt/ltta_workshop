BUT A GREAT FAMILY FROM TEXAS.

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,153
THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED

11
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,455
UPSIDE DOWN AND HEARTS BROKEN.

12
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:27,559
THEY DON'T EVEN GET A CALL FROM

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,827
THE FORMER MAYOR OF SAN ANTONIO

14
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,564
WHO WAS ON TV TALKING ABOUT THIS

15
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:33,565
CARAVAN THING AND DEMONIZING

16
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,200
DONALD TRUMP AND ALL REPUBLICANS

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,069
AND DIDN'T EVEN GET A CALL FROM

18
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,970
HIS BROTHER WHO IS A CONGRESSMAN

19
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,738
FROM AN AREA WHERE THIS KID WAS

20
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,606
BURNED THAT THAT.

21
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,407

22
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:46,578

JARED'S STORY.

26
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,852
HEARTBREAKING, TRAGIC, IT

27
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:54,753
SHOULD'VE NEVER HAPPENED.

28
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,755
YOU ARE RIGHT, THE DEMOCRATIC

29
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,990
POLITICIANS TURN A BLIND EYE TO

30
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,325
THE SUFFERING, THE VIOLENT

31
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,426
CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED.

32
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:04,296
I WAS GLAD TO HEAR HER DESCRIBE

33
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,597

00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,631

REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR CONGRESS

37
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,802

38
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,672
GOING TO MAKE A TERRIFIC

39
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,072
CONGRESSMAN.

40
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:14,806
MISSED VARGAS SHOULD NOT BE

41
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:15,173
SUFFERING.

42
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:17,943
THIS INDIVIDUAL, THIS ILLEGAL

43
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,545

49
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,153
YOU'VE GOT A VOLUNTARY REMOVAL

50
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,789
ORDER WHICH HE IGNORED.

51
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,991
IT'S THE REASON WE NEED TO PASS

52
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,793
CASE LAW, WHICH I'VE AUTHORED IN

53
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:38,397

ALIENS WHO ENTER THE COUNTRY

56
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,268
REPEATEDLY SHOULD FACE A

57
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,604
MANDATORY MINIMUM PRISON

58
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,673
SENTENCES SO VIOLENCE, CRIMINALS

60
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,381
>> Laura: THIS WAS A DWI --

61
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,383
>> WE SHOULD'VE DEPORTED HIM

62
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,553
WHEN HE HAD A DWI.

63
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,821
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN SENT OUT OF

64
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,990
THE BUS DOWN THE COUNTRY.

65
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:09,928
WE SHOULD NOT BE KEEPING -- TOO

66
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,563

IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE CRIMINALS WHO

69
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,769
COMMIT DWIS AND IT'S WRONG.

70
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,005
WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY

71
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:24,176
AND NOT ALLOWED CRIMINALS AND

72
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,110
DRUG DEALERS INTO THE COUNTRY.

73
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,679
>> Laura: YOU DID A FANTASTIC

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,082
JOB IN YOUR DEBATE WITH

75
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:31,516
MR. O'ROURKE.

76
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:35,020
A TOWN HALL TONIGHT AND I WANT

77
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:35,454

DISHONEST THING HE SAID OR I

81
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:40,792
COULD MAKE SURE PEOPLE

82
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,994
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S DOING.

83
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:43,995
LOOK, HE'S DISHONEST.

84
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,964
ONE OF THE REASONS HE GOT TAGGED

85
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,798
WITH THIS NICKNAME.

86
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:47,732
THAT NICKNAME RESONATES BECAUSE

87
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,202
IT'S TRUE.

88
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:54,940

99
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,742
THE PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO MAKE

100
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:58,109
HIS CASE.

101
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,547
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS NO -- HE'S A

102
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,182
GOOD-LOOKING GUY, BUT THERE IS

103
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,317
NO THERE THERE.

104
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,386
WHERE IS THE BEEF?

105
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:09,754
>> YOU CAN SEE THE DESPERATION

106
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,456
IN THAT DEBATE WHERE HE WAS

107
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,091
INSULTING ME, ATTACKING ME, CALL

108
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:13,592

109
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,860
WHAT'S STRIKING WHAT HE WAS

110
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,395
RESPONDING TO WHEN HE SAID LIAR

111
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:19,197
I POINTED OUT THAT HE VOTED IN

112
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,899

113
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,270

THE STATE OF TEXAS.

118
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,173
HIS RESPONSE IS NOT TO ENGAGE

119
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,876
BUT SCREAM, LIAR, LIAR, LIAR.

120
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,179
