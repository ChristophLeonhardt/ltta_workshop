THE PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE

82
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,525

83
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,726

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS

92
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,473
PUTTING TOGETHER A RECORD ON

00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,475
THE ECONOMY AND TRADE, WHICH

94
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,243
IS BETTER THAN ANY PRESIDENT

95
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:25,211
IN MODERN HISTORY.

96
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,080
I SAID QUIETLY BECAUSE THE

97

EVERY TIME YOU CRITICIZE

00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:37,790
TOUGH, YOU UNDERMINE THE

104
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,491
ABILITY OF THIS

105
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,326

AMERICAN PEOPLE.

108
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,896
THE PRESIDENT HAS IGNORED

109
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,531
THAT CRITICISM TO HIS

110
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:45,898
CREDIT.

111
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:46,833

120
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,746
NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN.

121
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,350

140
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,911
VERY CORDIAL RELATIONSHIPS.

141

THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

142
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,780
IT'S ALL SET.

143
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,348
THE WAY THIS IS GOING TO GO

WILL ALREADY BEGIN TO FEEL

151
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,094
THE EFFECTS INVESTMENT IN

152
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,729
THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS GOING

153
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,264
TO SHIFT BACK HERE TO NORTH

154
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,631
AMERICA.

155
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,999
IT'S GOING TO MEAN MORE

156
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,101
GROWTH, HIGHER WAGES, ALL

157
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:55,468
GOOD.

158
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,237
BRIAN: LASTLY, PETER, WHY

159
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,638

160
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,906
TARIFFS THAT USE AS WEDGE TO

163
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,210
YOU GOT A DEAL.

164
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,845
WHY NOT PUSH THEM AWAY FROM

165
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,812
MEXICO AND CANADA?

166
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,581
>> WELL, SEPARATE ISSUE.

167
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,548
APPLES AND ORANGES, BRIAN.

168
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,450
IT WAS NEVER USED AS A

169
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,152
BARGAINING CHIP, JUST APPLES

170
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,487

173
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,557
TO THOSE TWO INDUSTRIES.

174
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,091
THEY ARE TWO KEY PILLAR

175
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,026
INDUSTRIES WE NEED FOR

176
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:20,927
ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL

177
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,293
SECURITY.

178
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,729
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID,

179
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,964
THE ECONOMIC SECURITY IS

180
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:24,831
NATIONAL SECURITY.

181
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,801
SO LET'S FOCUS TODAY ON THE

182
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,069
NAFTA, NAFTA IS DEAD.

183
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,005
WE HAVE U.S. MCA.

184
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,273
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN

185
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,476
PRONOUNCE THAT.

186
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,944
BRIAN: YOU WENT TO BAT FOR

187
00:04:37,944 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS WHEN IT WASN'T POPULAR
