1
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:07,950
WHEN THESE COMPANIES --

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,584
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY

3
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:08,884
MUCH.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:09,451
GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH.

5
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,752
JOINING ME NOW WITH MORE,

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,689
AMBASSADOR, FORMER NATIONAL

7
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:14,823
SECURITY COUNCIL SENIOR

8
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:15,190
DIRECTOR.

9
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,091
AMBASSADOR, VERY GOOD TO HAVE

10
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:17,125
YOU WITH US.

11
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,093
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

12
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:18,860
I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO

13
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,331
THIS BREAKING NEWS FROM

14
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:24,333
NORTH KOREA AND THEIR OBJECTION

15
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:24,933
TO THESE EXERCISES.

16
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,101
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?

17
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,437
>> I DO THINK THAT WE ARE SEEING

18
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:30,706
SOME PROBING TO SEE WHAT WE

19
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:31,406
MIGHT DO.

20
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,408
THERE ALSO CERTAINLY IS A

21
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,378
POSSIBILITY HE'S TRYING TO PLAY

22
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:38,080
UPON WHAT IS THE UNMISTAKABLE

23
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,548
DESIRE OF THE SOUTH TO HAVE ALL

24
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:40,949
THIS WORK AND HERE AGAIN SEE IF

25
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:42,084
HE CAN GET SOMETHING FOR IT.

26
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,318
TO SHOW HE GET SOMETHING EVEN

27
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:45,487
BEFORE THE SUMMIT.

28
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:47,389
I THINK THERE'S ONE OTHER

29
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,789
POSSIBILITY.

30
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,524
OBVIOUSLY HERE THE PRESIDENT HAS

31
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:51,126
MADE IT CLEAR HE IS LOOKING

32
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:52,294
FORWARD TO THIS.

33
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:54,329
IN HIS BUILDING EXPECTATIONS AND

34
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,030
MAYBE WHAT YOU SEE KIM JONG UN

35
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,366
DO IS ALSO PROBE TO SEE OR AT

36
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,234
LEAST SEND A MESSAGE TO THE

37
00:00:59,234 --> 00:00:59,901
PRESIDENT THAT THIS ISN'T

38
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,970
NECESSARILY A GIVEN.

39
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,339
HE IS I THINK MANEUVERING RIGHT

40
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:04,605
NOW.

41
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,575
HE'S GOING TO BE KIND OF A K.G.

42
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:08,310
PLAYER WHEN IT COMES TO

43
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,077
NEGOTIATIONS AND HE IS TESTING

44
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:10,912
TO SEE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO

45
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,747
THE UNITED STATES.

46
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:13,115
>> Martha: WHAT TO THINK

47
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:13,782
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RESPONSE

48
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,916
SHOULD BE NOW?

49
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,686
>> I THINK THE RESPONSE SHOULD

50
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:18,253
BE HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT

51
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:22,557
DISCUSSIONS, BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU

52
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:27,362
CAN'T TALK TO YOURSELF.

53
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:28,063
IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO COME TO

54
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:28,764
THE SUMMIT, THAT'S HIS CHOICE.

55
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:29,464
>> Martha: I WANT TO TURN YOUR

56
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,165
ATTENTION TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

57
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:30,932
PLAYING OUT IN ISRAEL AND ALONG

58
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:31,433
THE GAZA BORDER.

59
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,868
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF MIXED

60
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:35,704
RESPONSE IN THE MEDIA WITH

61
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:36,605
REGARD TO THE VIOLENCE THAT WE

62
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:38,340
SAW ON THE GAZA STRIP AND HERE

63
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,309
IS SOME OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

64
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:40,909
HEARING IN THAT REGARD.

65
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,613
LET'S PLAY THAT.

66
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:45,280
>> MORE THAN 40 PEOPLE DEAD

67
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,816
TODAY AND THE WHITE HOUSE ISN'T

68
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,318
OFFERING CONDOLENCES, THEY ARE

69
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,453
NOT OFFERING ANY SORT OF

70
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:52,621
HEARTFELT COMMENTS ON THE LOSS

71
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,522
OF LIFE.

72
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:54,990
>> WITH THEIR SLINGSHOTS AND

73
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,426
BURNING TIRES, THE PROTESTERS,

74
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:58,160
INCLUDING SIX CHILDREN WHO WERE

75
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,062
REPORTEDLY KILLED TODAY, SEEM TO

76
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,931
BE LOSING THEIR LIVES FOR

77
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:03,298
NOTHING.

78
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:05,701
>> ALL OF THOSE BABIES ARE DEAD.

79
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:06,735
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

80
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:07,502
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE

81
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,471
DEAD TODAY.

82
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:10,104
FOR WHAT?

83
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:10,972
>> Martha: HERE'S THE RESPONSE

84
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:15,410
FROM BEN SHAPIRO.

85
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,078
>> I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY

86
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:20,082
MEDIA OUTLETS THAT ARE -- IT'S

87
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:20,716
ACTUALLY QUITE INCREDIBLE.

88
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:21,983
HAMAS HAS NOT BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT

89
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:22,718
THEIR INTENT HERE.

90
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:23,452
THEY'VE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS

91
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:24,686
THEY WANT TO SEND LITERALLY

92
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,821
100,000 PEOPLE TO STORM THE

93
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,889
BORDER WITH ISRAEL.

94
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:31,193
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

95
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,195
>> LOOK, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT

96
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,296
HAMAS IS TRYING TO TAKE

97
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:34,896
ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

98
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:36,131
I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP

99
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:37,265
BACK AND SAY WHAT IS IT THAT

100
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:38,734
HAMAS IS TRYING TO DO?

101
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,435
I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL

102
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:40,936
THINGS.

103
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:42,137
ONE, THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE

104
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:42,738
SUBJECT.

105
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:44,306
THEY WANT TO DIVERT ATTENTION

106
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:46,141
AWAY ABOUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN

107
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,409
GAZA, WHICH IS, IT'S AWFUL.

108
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:50,145
IF THE PEOPLE IN GAZA IN NO

109
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,913
SMALL PART HOLD HAMAS

110
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:52,447
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

111
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:56,518
TWO, THEY WANT TO PUT PRESSURE

112
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:57,419
ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE

113
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,019
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.

114
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,154
HE IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON THEM

115
00:02:59,154 --> 00:02:59,921
ECONOMICALLY AND WHEN THEY TAKE

116
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,923
ON THE ISRAELIS THIS WAY THEY

117
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:03,892
OBVIOUSLY PUT HIM IN THE CORNER

118
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,726
AS WELL.

119
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,694
THREE, THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO

120
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:07,596
STIGMATIZE THE ISRAELIS AND I

121
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:08,663
DON'T MIND IF THEY DIE IN THE

122
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:08,997
PROCESS.

123
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:11,700
A BETTER WAY TO PUT ISRAEL ON

124
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,300
THE DOCKET.

125
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,735
AND FOR THEY ARE PROBABLY TRYING

126
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,504
TO SHOW THEY ARE AT LEAST DOING

127
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,238
IS SOMETHING ON BEHALF OF THE

128
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,306
PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT.

129
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,141
THESE ARE ALL MOTIVATIONS, NONE

130
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:20,609
OF WHICH RELATE TO DOING

131
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,544
SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE OF

132
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:23,645
GAZA, ALL OF WHICH RELATE TO

133
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:25,313
HAMAS TRYING TO CHANGE THE

134
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:25,981
POSITION THAT IT'S IN.

135
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:27,416
>> Martha: I WANT TO PLAY THIS

136
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,117
FROM NIKKI HALEY TODAY AND GET

137
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:31,119
YOUR THOUGHTS AT THE U.N.

138
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,454
>> THE COMMON THREAD IN ALL OF

139
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:38,026
THIS IS THE DISABLING CONDUCT OF

140
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:39,394
THE IRANIAN REGIME, EVERYTHING

141
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:40,028
THAT INSISTS ON PROMOTING

142
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,062
VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THE

143
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,098
MIDDLE EAST WHILE DEPRIVING ITS

144
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,100
OWN PEOPLE OF BASIC HUMAN

145
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,434
RIGHTS.

146
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,302
>> Martha: SHE WALKED OUT

147
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:48,437
BEFORE THE PALESTINIAN LEADER

148
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:48,970
SPOKE THERE TODAY.

149
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,006
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT HER

150
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:52,941
COMMENTS?

151
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,943
>> I THINK SHE IS PUTTING WHAT'S

152
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,845
HAPPENING IN A BROADER CONTEXT.

153
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:57,579
I DON'T THINK THE IRANIANS ARE

154
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,047
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT'S GOING ON

155
00:03:59,047 --> 00:03:59,347
THERE.

156
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,117
I DO THINK THEY ARE CERTAINLY

157
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,552
INTERESTED.

158
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:05,120
ONE OF THE THINGS THE IRANIANS

159
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,921
WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE

160
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,156
PRESIDENT MADE THE DECISION ON

161
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:08,890
WALKING AWAY FROM THE JCPOA IS

162
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,558
TO TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT

163
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:12,127
THERE'S A CLOCK.

164
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,129
-- THERE'S A COST.

165
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,530
IT DOESN'T COME COST FREE.

166
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,932
ARE THEY THE ONES RESPONSIBLE

167
00:04:16,932 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR IT?
