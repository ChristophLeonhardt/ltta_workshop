and Harvey Weinstein turned himself in and he's accused of rape among other things and look I wasn't there I can't convict the guy but everything I know about it makes me feel like he should be put away and he was always a bad guy I know people who worked for him he was a bad guy and something like Amy more than 80 women have come out and accused him of everything from groping to actual actual rape and so he goes in and first of all the New York District Attorney Scotch tan attempt to arrest him before for molesting for groping women so there's our every and NBC did everything they could to smother this story by Ronan Farrow and you know so the left was really working hard to cover this up and now he's in court and he cuts it and his lawyer is outside the courtroom and he makes this kind of hilarious I mean I shouldn't say it's hilarious but he blames he blames the whole thing on the me2 movement and he makes this comment something that is bad behavior mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood and to the extent that there is bad behavior in that industry that is not what this is about bad behavior is not on trial in this case it's only if you intentionally committed a criminal act and mr. Weinstein vigorously denies that so he's conflating the bad behavior of Hollywood the casting couch with rape right he's be in you know conflating that to hoping that we it'll all get kind of messed together but the other people who are doing that are the me two people the the fact that the radical feminists have taken radicalism it ruins everything the fact that the radicals have taken over the me2 movement and made everything that men do seem toxic and tying us all men's fault and men men men it's it's it make it trivializes the fact that people were actually raped by this guy if indeed they were let's say they were allegedly raped by this guy that's that is not a trivial thing
