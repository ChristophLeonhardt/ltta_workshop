1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,740
There were hundreds of people

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,400
clamoring desperately to get inside,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,860
and when the doors finally opened,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,240
a near stampede of anxious bodies flooded through.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,200
But that’s just how an Apple launch event

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,480
typically kicks off.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,140
When there’s a new flagship product

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,260
like the iPhone 7,

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,740
Joanna and I essentially put our entire lives on hold

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,420
until we cover all the bases.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,100
At an event, Geoff and I analyze

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,800
and make sense of all the new details for our readers...

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,500
and occasionally drop a little snark.

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,680
Like Joanna tweeting about losing those AirPods

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,920
just from seeing them.

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,480
Yea, like that.

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,860
But the real work doesn’t start

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,379
until after the big event is over.

19
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,500
We take home early review units,

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,320
but only have five days to judge them

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,900
before they hit stores.

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,260
That means running 24-hour testing

23
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,700
to push these devices to their limits.

24
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,380
We’ve got automated web browsing

25
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,840
that simulates battery drain,

26
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,320
camera comparisons against every competitor,

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,360
I even have a special jacket to carry them all around.

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,360
We’re trying to squeeze a lifetime of conceivable punishment

29
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,940
into a couple of days,

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,920
so we have to get creative.

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,840
For example, to test the iPhone 7’s water resistance,

32
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,900
I got out my wetsuit and snorkel,

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,240
and shot an entire video underwater.

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,780
Considering how people these days

35
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,400
are even bringing their devices to bed,

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,740
it’s really important to put them through their paces...

37
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,020
Specs are one thing,

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,720
but real-world tests are what truly matter.

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Luckily for us,

40
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,580
that’s actually a fun process,

41
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,920
so we don’t mind going to...

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,680
extreme depths.

43
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,460
Oh, I see what you did there.

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,600
I’m Geoffrey Fowler,

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,720
and I’m Joanna Stern,

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,840
Wait, we got that backwards.

47
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,380
He’s Geoffrey Fowler,

48
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,940
and she’s Joanna Stern,

49
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,320
and we’re Technology Columnists

50
00:01:36,420 --> 00:00:00,000
at The Wall Street Journal.
