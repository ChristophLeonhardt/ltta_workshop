00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the Dems would come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font>

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,059
candidate who would you pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,620
Democrat nominee in 2020

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,469
that's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim Acosta no question Jim</font>

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,330
Acosta<font color="#CCCCCC"> won because he looks like a</font>

8

generic president you know he's just

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a sort of glib guy with silly hair</font>

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,170
you know perfectly quaffed hair and

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything which looks good on some</font>

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,490
people but Jim Acosta would also be a

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,599
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> choice because first of all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mouthpiece of Democrats he's he oh</font>

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">already on the CNN mouthpiece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Iran</font>

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Democrat mouthpiece of CNN he's</font>

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,950
already on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their main communications</font>

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,239
platform so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be pretty helpful</font>

22
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also it would really rile up the</font>

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Democrats because he's a straight white</font>

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,910
man<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as I know so they're gonna</font>

25
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,190
say oh gosh he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is the avatar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

26
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,690
Democrats but we have to hate straight

27
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,489
white guys now so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are what do we do</font>

28
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,930
about it my<font color="#E5E5E5"> ramaa and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

29
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,699
apart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really good and the the</font>

30
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,140
simpler answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Hillary Clinton</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,670
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like she may run might be more</font>

32
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">likely that she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> runs again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but who knows</font>

33
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,930
if the Democrats will successfully

34
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,850
reanimate that corpse in time for 2020

35
00:01:08,850 --> 00:00:00,000
otherwise my money's on Jim Acosta
