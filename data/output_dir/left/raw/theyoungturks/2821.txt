1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,670
IT IS LOOKING INCREASINGLY
LIKELY WITH ALL THE NEWS COMING

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,359
OUT THAT THE ROBERT MUELLER
INVESTIGATORY TEAM MIGHT

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,219
ACTUALLY WANT A SITDOWN,
FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW WITH THE

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,720
PRESIDENT.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:37,789
THEY COULD 

6
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,980
INTERVIEW HIM SOON.

7
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,050
YOU MIGHT BE COMFORTABLE WITH
IT.

8
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,850
I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT SHOULD HE?

9
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,850
NO.

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,579
THAT IS UNEARNED CONFIDENCE THAT
TRUMP IS SO WELL KNOWN FOR.

11
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:02,559
HE DOESN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH HE
GETS HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE BY HIS

12
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,559
TWEETS, HIS MOUTH.

13
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:10,590
THE FACT THAT HE THINKS THAT
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,600
I TWEETED LAST NIGHT THAT IF
HE HAS TWO BRAIN CELLS HE WILL

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,869
NEVER ALLOW HIMSELF TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS BEFORE MUELLER OR

16
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,079
THE TEAM.

17
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,640
BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE
SELF-AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,600
ABOUT HOW YOU ARE AND THE
LIKELIHOOD OF IT WORKING WELL

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
FOR YOU.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,150
HE IS NOT BIG ON SELF-AWARENESS.

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,290
HE OPENLY SAID DURING AN
INTERVIEW THAT HE FIRED JAMES

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,980
COMEY BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,220
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE
THINGS HE SAYS GET HIM IN

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,810
TROUBLE.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,390
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE NOT IN THE
PRESIDENT'S SIDE.

26
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,259
WHAT DO CONSERVATIVES THINK?

27
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,359
LET'S TURN TO JUDGE NAPOLITANO
TALKING ABOUT WHAT TRUMPS

28
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,579
STRATEGY SHOULD BE.

29
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,570
WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT
WANTS TO SUBMIT TO AN INTERVIEW

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,859
ABOUT MUELLER AND FBI AGENTS, MY

31
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:07,479
ARGUMENT IS NEVER SHOULD
HE DO THAT.

32
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,479
WHY?

33
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,479
BECAUSE

34
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,600
HE CANNOT KNOW WHAT MUELLER AND
HIS TEAM KNOW ABOUT THE CASE.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,640
HE CANNOT KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE
THEY HAVE.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,390
ONE LIE OR ONE CLOSE TO A LIE
ABOUT

37
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,740
A MATERIAL MATTER AND HE WAS
FACING A POTENTIAL INDICTMENT.

38
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,470
NO SITTING PRESIDENT HAS EVER
BEEN INDICTED FOR A CRIME.

39
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,800
BUT IF THE FEDS WANT TO TRAP YOU
THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT DOING IT.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,270
DONALD TRUMP IS A VERY
HEADSTRONG PERSON WHO PROBABLY

41
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,050
BELIEVES HE IS SMARTER THAN HIS
INTERROGATORS AND HE MAY BE,

42
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,190
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW MORE ABOUT
THE CASE THAN THEY DO.

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,280
IT IS A TRAP AND THEY SHOULD
STAY AWAY FROM IT.

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,480
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME
PEOPLE, MAYBE A FEW HAVE

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,420
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

46
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,370
KENNEDY WOULD SAY HE SHOULD GO
TALK BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN MY

47
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,840
DEAR LEADER DOUBLE ALMOST

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,390
EVERYONE ELSE KNOW THAT THIS
SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.

49
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,180
IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO CAN SIT
IN THAT SORT OF ENVIRONMENT WHO

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,190
ARE THERE TO SHRED THE FLESH

51
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,630
FROM YOUR BONES, IT WILL NOT BE
DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY.

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,880
HIS LAWYERS DON'T WANT IT WHICH
IS WHY THEY HAVE COME UP WITH

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,340
ALTERNATIVE IDEAS.

54
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:43,100
HERE ARE SOME OPTIONS.

55
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,500
THAT SHOULD END THE DISCUSSION.

56
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,430
WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT
AT THAT POINT.

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,240
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE THINKING,
THEY ARE GOING TO RIDICULOUS

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,930
LENGTHS TO GET HIM OUT OF
THE SITDOWN.

59
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:06,400
IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT'S
LEGAL TEAM THAT IS WHAT THEY

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
SHOULD DO.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,880
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
DIFFERENCE IS.

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,329
THAT IS HOW THEY

63
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,138
SHOULD DEFEND HIM AND THESE ARE
THE THINGS THEY SHOULD BE

64
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,330
OFFERING BUT THERE IS NO WAY THE
INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR AND

65
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,419
COUNCIL SHOULD ACCEPT THAT ALSO.

66
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,879
THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO ASK
BECAUSE I'M NOT A LAWYER.

67
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,740
I AM UNAWARE OF HOW IT WOULD
WORK IF THEY DO TRY TO DODGE

68
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,599
TRUMP TESTIFYING.

69
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:40,000
IS HE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT?

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,920
IF HE IS THE ONE UNDER

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,449
INVESTIGATION 単 AND ANY OTHER
CONTACTS THE PERSON UNDER

72
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:47,830
INVESTIGATION IS NOT GOING TO

73
00:04:47,830 --> 00:05:00,870
SAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU 

74
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,580
A
WRITTEN STATEMENT.

75
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,370
THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN
TERMS OF SUBPOENA POWER.

76
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,990
FIRST WHY DOES IT MATTER?

77
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,910
YOU
EITHER HAVE THEM IN OR YOU CAN

78
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,080
ASK QUESTIONS AND HAVE THEM DO
A WRITTEN RESPONSE.

79
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:35,949
CHUCK ROSENBERG SAID THIS.

80
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,999
I DON'T THINK ANYONE NECESSARILY
KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WOULD

81
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,889
HAPPEN IF HE SAYS NO YOU HAVE
TO COME IN HERE.

82
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,449
BUT THERE ARE SOME PRIOR SUPREME
COURT STATEMENTS LIKE THIS

83
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,310
THAT MIGHT GIVE US AN IDEA.

84
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,310
IT IS SO TELLING, WHENEVER YOU
TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND ALL

85
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,310
HIS TROUBLES, LET'S GO
BACK TO NIXON.

86
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,310
NOT JUST NIXON, WE HAVE A
LITTLE BIT ON BILL CLINTON.

87
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,310
BUT POSSIBLY WITH SIMILAR
CHARGES COMING OUT.

88
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,310
THE SUPREME COURT IN REFERENCE
TO BILL CLINTON SAID THIS.

89
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,310
I AM SURE THEY WOULD MAKE THE
CASE THAT APPROPRIATE

90
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,020
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE IN PERSON WITH
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.

91
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:33,610
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
BECAUSE THEY SAID A FEW WEEKS

92
00:06:33,610 --> 00:07:05,600
POTENTIALLY BUT THEY ALSO SAID
IT WOULD BE A LIMITED SET OF

93
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
QUESTIONS.

94
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,620
HE COULD BE THAT IS NOT THE ONLY
TIME THEY TALK TO HIM.

95
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,819
THEY MAY HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT
THEY HAVE ALREADY FOUND OUT.

96
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:18,050
COULD BE QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSSIA
OR MONEY LAUNDERING AS STEVE

97
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,379
BANNON HAS PREDICTED.

98
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,620
WHAT I REALLY RESPECT ABOUT
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS

99
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,499
HOW THERE HAVEN'T BEEN WEEKS.

100
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:32,000
AND MUELLER HAS ACCIDENTALLY
SAID SOMETHING.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:44,809
IS 
NOT COMING FROM MUELLER

102
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:45,809
DIRECTLY.

103
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:50,910
I KNOW POLITICALLY THERE ARE
DISAGREEMENTS WITH BULLER AND

104
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,930
MYSELF.

105
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,509
I LIKE THE WAY HE IS CARRYING
OUT THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE

106
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,199
I FEEL LIKE IN ANY OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WOULD BE

107
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,449
ATTENTIVE LEAKS AND INFORMATION
THAT SHOULD BE GETTING OUT

108
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,449
THERE.

109
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,510
I WANT THIS INVESTIGATION TO BE
FAIR AND THE ONLY WAY FOR IT

110
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,430
TO HAPPEN IS FOR LEAKS
NOT TO OCCUR.

111
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:19,479
THE AUDIENCE AT FOX NEWS SEES
JUDGE NAPOLITANO SAYING IT IS A

112
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:32,179
TRAP 単 SO HE GAVE HIS LEGAL
ADVICE TO TRUMP DIRECTLY.

113
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,179
SO NOW

114
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,439
THAT GOES DOWN SHUT THE NEXT

115
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,210
RESPONSE BE WHO WAS WATCHING?

116
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,690
OF
COURSE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING OR

117
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,590
HE WOULDN'T TELL HIS CLIENT NOT
TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET

118
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,670
CAUGHT UP IN SOME.

119
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,930
I REMEMBER BACK IN THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION I WAS LOOKING FOR

120
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,711
SOME OF THESE QUOTES 単 IF YOU
HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE WHAT ARE

121
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:58,900
YOU RUNNING FROM?

122
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,480
IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE, OR
LIE ABOUT, WHY ARE YOU WORRIED

123
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,150
ABOUT GOING INTO AN INTERVIEW
WITH MUELLER AND LYING?

124
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,250
THAT IS WHAT HE CAUGHT HIMSELF
WHEN HE SAID ALIVE OR ANYTHING

125
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,680
APPROACHING A LIE COULD BE 単

126
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,520
REMEMBER THE RIGHT WING, THOSE
WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TRUMP

127
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:23,550
PAINT THIS INVESTIGATION AS A
POLITICAL MOVE BY THE LEFT AND

128
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,870
THEY ARE NOW CONSTANTLY
QUESTIONING THE INTEGRITY OF

129
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,950
MUELLER WHICH IS HILARIOUS
BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING THEY

130
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,880
LOVE THE FACT THAT MUELLER WAS

131
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,830
APPOINTED TO A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

132
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,680
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW
THEY ARE DOING THIS.

133
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,981
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT HE
IS TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE

134
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:43,240
MUELLER IS JUST THERE
TO TRAP YOU.

135
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,810
AND TRY TO MISLEAD YOU.

136
00:09:47,810 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S NONSENSE.
