Laura: IT’S FRIDAY, WHICH MEANS IT’S TIME FOR OH, PROTESTERS GET CREATIVE OUTSIDE MITCH McCONNELL’S HOUSE AND SEXUAL POLITICS ARE TAKING OVER BOARD ROOMS AND CLASSROOMS. FOR THE DETAILS, WE’RE JOINED BY RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, COMEDIAN DURING BREAKS, AND AUTHOR OF "THE WILL WILDER SERIES." TELL ME ABOUT THE EARLY MORNING PROTESTS OUTSIDE OF McCONNELL’S TELL ME ABOUT THE EARLY MORNING PROTESTS OUTSIDE OF McCONNELL’S CONDO. IT’S 7:30 IN THE MORNING AND YOU ARE AWAKENED BY A PROTEST COMING UP THE BLOCK. ELAINE, WHAT IS THAT OUT THERE. THEN HE SAW THIS. CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG! I LIKE BEER! I LIKE BORE! I LIKE BEER! Laura: THEY WERE WALKING UP THE BLOCK SAYING "I LIKE BEER," "CHUG, CHUG, CHUG". THIS IS LIKE PIRATES OF THE CANADIAN, JOINED BY THE DUNKEN PROTESTERS. THEY HAVE PABST RED RIBBON Laura: RED? IT’S BLUE. I DON’T TOUCH THE STUFF STUFF. AND THEY HAVE THE RED SOLO CUPS. BRETT KAVANAUGH AT HIS HEARING DID MENTION THIS. WE DRANK BEER, MY FRIENDS AND I, BOYS AND GIRLS, YES, WE DRANK WE DRANK BEER, MY FRIENDS AND I, BOYS AND GIRLS, YES, WE DRANK BEER. I LIKE BEER. STILL LIKE BEER. WE DRANK BEER. WE LIKE BEER. MY QUESTION, I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE PROTEST IS ABOUT. IF YOU DON’T LIKE THE GUY WHY ARE YOU MIMICKING HIS WORDS. DO YOU SUPPORT HIM OR NOT? Laura: SEEMS LIKE ANY RANDOM MORNING ON FRAT ROW AT DARTMOUTH, WHAT WE WERE DOING. DIDN’T LOOK LIKE A PROTEST, IT WAS COLLECTION OF DISGRUNTLED MEMBERS. Laura: A ZONING DPROOEF ANSWER. THIS WAS A CREATIVE PROTEST COMPARED TO THE BOWELS OF THE CAPITOL. THIS IS AN ORGANIZER, GIVING HIS MARCHERS ORDERS. BUT I THINK, ARE THEY IN KINDERGARTEN? YOU BE THE JUDGE. LET’S GO WATCH THE KROET. LET’S GO WATCH THE VOTE. I AM GOING TO GO HI. WE’RE GOING TO HAVE FUN. Laura: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, THEY WERE GOING TO THE WRONG OFFICE. WEREN’T THEY GOING TO HEIDI HEITKAMP? WAIT, ZOMBIE, SHE’S ON OUR SIDE. OH. TOTALLY MY BAD. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHANT AND ECHO FOR BASIC ORDERS. Laura: WE’RE GOING TO THE OFFICES. TO THE OFFICES. THE "ME TOO" MOVEMENT GETTING A BIG BIRTHDAY PRESENT. IN CALIFORNIA THE GOVERNOR REQUIRING PUBLIC CORPORATIONS TO, IN HIS STATE, TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE FEMALE DIRECTOR ON THEIR BOARD. BY 2021, EVERY BOARD HAS TO HAVE THREE FEMALE DIRECTORS. IS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL? Laura: I THINK PACIFIC ISLANDERS, LATINO AMERICANS, AND EVERY OTHER GROUP SHOULD SAY, WHAT ABOUT ME. HOW ABOUT MEN? I JUST WANT MEN TO BE ON THE ALL FEMALE BOARDS. Laura: THERE ARE NO ALL FEMALE BOARDS. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE SELFIE SUICIDE. THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES, 259 PEOPLE IN SEVEN YEARS, LOST THEIR LIVES TAKING THESE RISKY SELFIE SHOTS. MOSTLY MEN. PEOPLE BETWEEN 10 AND 29. BUT THAT NUMBER IS REALLY LOW. THEY’RE SAYING IT’S ALMOST 250, IT’S MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. ALL THEY DID WAS LOOK AT PUBLICLY DECLARED CASES A LOT THAT WENT UNDECLARED. PEOPLE ON ROOFTOPS, MONUMENTS, IN TRAFFIC, AND THEY’RE DYING TAKING SHOTS. REAL VANITY. BEFORE I GO. Laura: UH-OH. JUST TO BRING IT ALL TOGETHER, LAURA, THE WHOLE SEGMENT. WE’LL TAKE SELFIE. YOU TAKE THAT ONE. Laura: THIS HURTS MY HAND.
