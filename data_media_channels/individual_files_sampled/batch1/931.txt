hello I'm Richard is Burton you're at the listening post here are some of the developments were tracking this week Kenya the election story from last year that runs and runs and the media now caught in the middle viewer beware YouTube puts labels on news videos in the US produced by state-funded media outlets it's back to the drawing board for the French president whose media strategy was due for a change and tone-deaf advertising at the Superbowl Kenya is in the midst of a political power struggle and the country's media outlets are at the heart of the story when opposition leader rila Odinga held a mock inauguration ceremony last week declaring himself the people's president he was out to challenge the legitimacy of president Uhuru Kenyatta who won an election held late last year that Odinga boycotted saying the vote was raped the Kenyatta government wants to put the election story behind it get on with governing and deny Odinga the oxygen of publicity so it ordered the Kenyan media to ignore the alternative inauguration and went 3 privately owned TV channels defied those orders and tried to broadcast the event the authorities pulled the plug on them journalists cried foul at the government's heavy-handed approach but it's not like the Kenyan media don't have some credibility issues of their own our starting point this week is Nairobi at some point somebody in the Kenyatta government presumably the President himself would have made this calculation what would be worse a piece of political theater televised devised to put the legitimacy of the government in question or denying the media the right to broadcast the Earth's at svet vo is countrywide while throwing into the dot the signal that sends the perception it creates it might have seemed like a good idea in the short term as a show of force but what did what it does in the long term is it says we are going to undermine the public's right to information for the sake of security with short term power and that's a real threat to democracy and I think if they hadn't given it as much attention as they did it would have just been a footnote in the political history of the country the first thing is the it tells us that the government itself does not feel that it is bound by the Constitution and by our laws what was really significant here is that our media from when the Kenyatta government came in have pretty much behaved like this government can be their friend they thought that would buy them some protection and what they are now learning is that all they have done is to embolden the state Kenya's presidential election should have been settled five months ago August 8 2017 the incumbent woohoo - Kenyatta was declared the winner by 10 points over rila Odinga Odinga challenged the result in court saying the Electoral Commission's computers had been hacked the results tampered with the Supreme Court ruled with Odinga saying that by denying the court access to its IT system the Commission left the judges with no choice they nullified the election results and ordered another vote for October the second round played out like a farce Odinga pulled out saying the fix was in a key member of the Electoral Commission fled the country citing political interference and death threats voter turnout was less than half of Ottawa's in round one and the Electoral Commission declared Kenyatta the winner with more than 98 percent of the vote in most civilized countries when the Electoral Commission gives the result that is the result and everybody accepts it and the country moves on in Kenya we have a very very different society because the suspicion is always a question mark what didn't they tell us did they hide something and I think the media finds itself in that space most notably after the election of late 2007 the results were disputed and the violence lasted for months more than a thousand were killed more than half a million displaced refugees of an electoral aftermath the causes of that violence were many and complex however the Kenyan media got much of the blame during the campaign television stations had aired in century political acts in breach of their own regulations small local radio stations then incited the post-election violence by broadcasting hate speech stung by that criticism many Kenyan news outlets changed their ways toned down their content and started playing it safe it's absolutely untrue that we are the ones who caused this problem post-election violence had a whole set of other causal issues but that's to me is the moment in which the media started to take a step back from directly criticizing the state the politicians and giving up the space I call it the we want peace narrative so between 2007 and 2013 the media was in this place where they were thinking okay how do we do the next general election without being blamed and so the media was then criticised in 2013 and I think rightly so for having been too careful that vote in 2013 was the first to elect president Kenyatta by years and his government had passed a new media law giving itself the power to find news outlets a law those outlets opposed and won the us-based Committee to Protect Journalists described as draconian the Kenyan media might have seen that lock coming earlier that year on the 100th day of his presidency Kenyatta summoned media owners and their executives to a breakfast meeting the government will allow journalists from media houses be embedded to status but from opening the government to scrutiny by the media as one of the president's allies in the media puts it in Yara simply spelled out the role he expected journalists to play so what the president was asking on that occasion is that we should not be adverse or even as you add the public watchdog even as you set the agenda the agenda should not be adversary meaning the media should not make itself as an opposition party you should play the role of being Fourth Estate that is the message that the president was trying to to get out because the median in Kenya has always played the role of an opposition party president who looking at early today so to write a new chapter in government relations with the media so it's fine he can call them me they can opti he can articulate what his agenda is but then the media has to be able to take a step back and critique what the president is saying and that never happened at the time that the media was called in the government was angry aged in what it called an anti-terror operation in Garissa which is to the Northeast well it had rounded out upwards of 500 people it was just picking up people off the street they were suspected terrorists you know not a single person in the media took the opportunity during that breakfast to ask about that operation from this media breakfast with the state what they did was they escalated that we want peace narrative like well you're the media you're not a PR agency you're the media your job is to to keep their feet in the fire to keep them honest that's the whole concept of a Fourth Estate that keeps people honest and when they decide to go in bed with the executive and become an extension of the executive if you think about it as a table it's a table with three legs you know how is it supposed to stand this story comes down to questions of legitimacy the Kenyatta government had its legitimacy challenged by rila Odinga in the most public of ways the media tried to broadcast that ceremony perhaps hoping to regain the legitimacy they squandered last year falling short as election watchdogs and going soft on the Kenyatta government if the Kenyan media thought that would land them in the government's good graces then what happened last week proved they made a big mistake and going to black the way they did would have come as a rude awakening he hasn't been seen in this country all the major television stations are shut down because of a story not that they covered but that they were going to cover this is one of the most vibrant media spaces on the continent and I really do hope that this was a bad dream it's gonna go away we are going to wake up to the usual vibrant media professional media that we've known Kenya to have the shutdown was just some sort of wake-up call even tell me this is an opportunity that they should be grateful for forever they are got a wake-up call discussing other media stories that are on our radar today with one of our producers pteridophyta Tariq YouTube has just introduced a new feature that will alert users when they're watching news content that is funded by governments what's the point of this yeah this is the latest in a series of measures by social media companies to try and counter misinformation and propaganda online but it's already proving contentious YouTube said that took the decision to help users better understand the sources of news content they posted this screenshot from Radio Free Asia which is funded by the US Congress as an example here's the problem though YouTube will not differentiate between news outlets that are publicly funded but editorially independent and outlets that take funding and editorial direction from a government US public broadcaster PBS isn't happy about that it says it gets a small amount of its funding from the US government the rest from private donations and it doesn't want to be labeled a state broadcaster which it could be under the new rules so who's going to be seeing these labels which news outlets stand to be affected so at the moment it's only YouTube videos that are being played in the US but plenty of global outlets are likely to be affected including the UK's BBC China's cg Tian and this one Al Jazeera which is funded by the Qatari government but I think it's fair to say that this move primarily targets outlets like the Russian funded RT there's been a bit of hysteria in the US over Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election and RT has been singled out on that so I asked RT for its reaction to this move and they said congratulations to YouTube on labeling our content with the basic info we've always made known peculiar though that in its hierarchy of broadcasters some are more government-funded than others the other story you've been looking into is the intensification of the crackdown against certain news websites in Egypt what's the story there yes worth starting at the beginning of this story in May last year the government began blocking access to dozens of news websites among them one of the few independent media outlets left in Egypt meda massa according to a cairo-based NGO the blacklist has grown to some 496 different platforms and they includes news outlets human rights organizations blogs and VPNs some blocked media outlets madhumatl for example had been using a google publishing tool called a MP accelerated mobile pages which allows egyptians to see madam others content on their mobiles the New York Times and CNN you vampy as well but now that's been blocked - what reasoning what justification is the government offering for this if any well that's the interesting thing there's been no comment from the government not now nor back in May when this crackdown first began it's worth mentioning though that Egypt is gearing up for an election next month and the current president Abdul Fattah el-sisi has pretty much snuffed out all his competition okay thanks to her during last year's presidential election campaign Emmanuel macron was the darling of the French news media his promises of a new world and a new French Revolution seemed tailor-made for The Times so did McConnell's image as the politician offering a cure for France's stagnant economy he swept to power 66% of the vote demolishing his opponent from the far right however his romance with the media has since turned sour the new president's reluctance to engage with journalists has made him appear aloof distant and has made some contentious policies such as spending cuts and an overhaul of labor laws that much harder to sell so McConnell has been changing his approach making himself more available the listening posts Cristina Martinez now from Paris on how Emmanuel macron revamped media strategy is going down with Frances troublesome and opinionated Fourth Estate it's a classic political tactic code the news media on your way to power make time for them smile for the cameras then once you are sworn into office develop a certain aversion to journalists we very rarely see macro the Elysees palace is quite an impregnable fortress macron does not host luncheons with journalists like his predecessor Francois Hollande used to please stop doing all of that there's never an off-the-record moment he's a president who is always on the wreck when you bundle of macro arrived at the Elysee Palace having been traumatized by what had happened to his predecessor in the hands of the media as Minister for finance macron witnessed that from up close and must have thought his solution was to build a boat between him and journalists the first break in that war was microns mobile phone Francois loans made his mobile number available to journalists dozens of them could contact the former president anytime McCune didn't want to play the game that way and from his earliest days in office he made it clear which journalists he wanted covering his story at the outset Emmanuel Michael seemed like he was part president part assignment editor for instance only a few days into his mandate the president decided to travel to molly's he then contacted certain media outlets to let them know he only wanted journalists he specialized in defense and foreign policy not political Jan therefore they've caused quite a stir among media outlets he rightly said that the president should not be allowed to choose which journalist to have by his side it was his first show of strength and soda plenty ever had fierce good Dajani so I was shocking I mean a lot of journalists think he almost never talks but that's not true he talks about quite a lot of Jurists there mainly for ik and that annoys French journalists a lot you talk to CNN mr. president welcome to the program and when he went to Africa he spoke to 200 students so it's not that he doesn't speak it's just that he talks to others the media here have no choice but to use bits of these encounters comedia Amir Muhammad universe show nouvelle on Hulu hop electric Ron's choice of words is never a coincidence he often uses English terms so Ricky no permit ha to make our planet great again in task force on T - mini fake news and it's very disrupting for us as French journalists and also for French people who feel disconnected we are not the target of his messages he is targeting business executives and decision-makers worldwide I don't want him within three months of taking office having won 66% of the vote McCune saw a sharp slide in his poll numbers his proposed labor reforms and tax cuts were making the wrong kinds of headlines so Mike indeed what most politicians who are having trouble with journalists - he hired one bhunivelze PT a business journalist was his new communications director across two magazine channel he suppose a particular need esoteric news of mr. Boger GPT made room in makan schedule for magazines like the glossy party much and a conservatively poor on the TV side he paired his balls with silly a noona a celebrity host who is more of an actor comedian than a journalist it could be easily made yaki makan favors media outlets to have a direct impact on the public like having a match which life covering the presidential cuttle or civil an owner who is extremely popular with young people we will swap is it on come on setup cocido of course when makan cool Solano now live on TV the political journalists are choking because they keep trying to reach the president and in fact are still waiting for a cool battle it was almost five months before Michael relented and granted his first French TV interview he didn't go to France state broadcaster he chose the largest privately owned channel in stock why is concerned except it bounces but for this is your new Paris as well when he finally did speak to state TV macaw and the journalist blue and allows the strolled around the Elysee Palace it struck French journalists and audiences has a very American style of light touch interviewing de jeunesse the Marquis crumbs youth has been a major asset in his political rise he realized he couldn't present himself in the same way as former presidents he needed to do something in keeping with his new world ideal so he invited someone from his generation they met as two young people one a president the other the journalist with the most important audience in France he decided to act like they do on American shows American mob Oscar I think macro tricks Lauren della whose how do you conduct a meaningful interview when you're strolling through the Elise's corridors in dim light you can't ask sharp questions in that kind of setting only door what could be a victim at least a path to solving bills a piece of you by accepting this format della loose was forced to go in with a series of softball questions it looked like a concession from the press and it added fuel to the fire regarding the media's relationship with the president we know nationally glossy people are in man will make whore no longer gives French journalists the silent treatment but the relationship is far from koryo he has criticized previous presidents for being too close to journalist accused the French media of narcissism and has reportedly called the state broadcaster la aunt de la république the shame of the Republic Makran has made it clear they are in for an overhaul among the buzz words being circulators there is restructuring and externalization that means putting more TV production work into the hands of independent media companies but there's also talk of big budget cuts media analysts here say the proposed reforms could result in less public service journalism and eventually fewer people holding power to account to Ljubljana noia Bushido for instance the government plans to change the amount of airtime parliamentary parties get on TV this could mean about 70 percent of airtime goes to macron zone party on marsh and only 30 percent of their time goes to all the others this could be a game-changer for now we know very little about these reforms necessary shouldn't prejudge the president what a scintilla to do took place throughout the whole history of French presidents and broadcasters weather with meteorologist Kyle cozy a bit less with elan has been about keeping public TV and radio under their control I think he's really old world in that he thinks he should have complete control over public broadcasting but when it comes to the media McCool's intentions are not all that different to his predecessors even if the tactics and the rhetoric are if the French president gets away with it his so-called revolution will be televised his way finally the media extravaganza that is the Super Bowl American footballs annual finale is a showcase for advertisers they pay up to five million dollars for a 30-second spot Ram trucks PO need up this year and used an unlikely pitchman Martin Luther King through extracts from one of his speeches back in 1968 the company somehow failed to foresee that the appropriation of the words of an african-american civil rights leader to sell cars would not go down well and it's the NFL where hundreds of players have been taking a knee to protest the treatment of african-americans at the hands of the police in short the optics were brutal here's some of the ad in question alongside another version a subvert Iseman by current affairs magazine which uses different extracts of the same speech to make a rather different point about the shamelessness of the advertising industry we'll see you next time here at The Listening Post if you want to be a part of wonderful if you want to be recognized wonderful we are so often taken by advertisers you know are those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion and they have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you in the bind in order to make your neighbors envious you must try this type of car in order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick er this kind of perfume I got to drive this car because it's something about this car that makes my car a little better than my neighbor's car I am sad to say that the nation in which we live is the supreme culprit and I'm going to continue to say it to America
