ACROBATICS, TUMBLING.

131
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,041

133
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:46,609
IT WAS KIND OF SEPARATE.

WHEN I WAS IN SECOND GRADE,

154
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:18,507
THERE WAS NO GIRLS TEAM FOR

155
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,642
SOCCER.

156
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:20,510
MY MOM CONVINCED THE COACH TO

157
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,045
GIVE ME A TRYOUT AND SAID IF SHE

158
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,579
IS GOOD ENOUGH AND SHE IS AS

159
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,348
GOOD AS ANY OF THE GUYS PLAYING,

160
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,883
THEN PUT HER ON THE TEAM.

161
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:28,618
IF SHE'S NOT, CUT HER.

162
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,653
I MADE THE TEAM.

163
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:31,854
I LIKED IT.

164
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,923
IT TAUGHT ME TO RELINE HER SOFT,

165
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,692
PRACTICE, WORK HARD AND DO IT.

166
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,327
EVENTUALLY THEY HAD A GIRLS

167
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:37,860
TEAM.

168
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,262
>> Greg: DO YOU REMEMBER ON

169
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:41,698
THE BRADY BUNCH WHEN PETER BRADY

170
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,866
BECAME A SUNFLOWER, GIRL SCOUTS.

171
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,635
THEN MARCIA BRADY JOINED THE

172
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:46,035
GIRL SCOUTS.

173
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,372
THAT WAS IN THE EARLY '70s.

174
00:04:49,372 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Jesse: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
