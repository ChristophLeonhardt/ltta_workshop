This is a polar bear’s life,
and this is a polar bear’s life,
and this, too, is a 
polar bear’s life.
They’re all wearing 
collars with
cameras and 
accelerometers —
like Fitbits for bears.
Researchers at the 
U.S. Geological Survey
have put these collars on a
number of bears so they
can match accelerometer 
patterns with activities,
like walking or swimming.
And as a side benefit, 
the cameras caught life
from a bear’s point of view.
Killing a seal when they’re 
out on the ice.
Eating berries when they’re 
stuck on land.
Socializing with a 
possible mate.
Once they have the
collars calibrated,
they can track the bears 
for long periods of time.
And they can see how their 
activity and energy use
changes as the climate 
warms and sea ice declines.
For now, we get a glimpse 
of what bears
are seeing 
and perhaps thinking.
“Is this the bear I want to
cuddle with on an 
Arctic night?”
