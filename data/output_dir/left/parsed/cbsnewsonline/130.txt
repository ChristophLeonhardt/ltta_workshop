AND ASK YOU TO READ YOUR OWN 
WORDS. 
MARCH 4THS, 2016,. 
>>  YOU WANT ME TO READ THIS? 
>>  YES. 
>>  OMG HE IS AN IDIOT. 
>>  MAY 4TH, 2016. 
>>  NOW THE PRESSURE REALLY 
STARTS TO FINISH MYE. 
>>  JULY 19TH, 2016. 
>>  HI. 
HOW IS TRUMP OTHER THAN A 
DOUCHE? 
>>  JULY 21ST. 
2016. 
>>  TRUMP IS A DISASTER. 
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW 
DESTABILIZING HIS 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE. 
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE I WROTE  
THIS. 
>>  AUGUST 8TH. 
2016. 
I WILL SAY THIS FOR CONTEXT. 
LISA PAGE SAID NOT EVER GOING 
TO BECOME PRESIDENT, RIGHT? 
, RIGHT? 
>>  NO. 
NO HE IS NOT. 
WE WILL STOP IT. 
>>  REPEAT THAT AGAIN? 
>>  NO. 
NO HE IS NOT. 
WE WILL STOP IT. 
>>  AUGUST 15TH, 2016. 
>>  I WANT TO BELIEVE THE PATH 
YOU THREW OUT FOR CONSIDERATION 
IN ANDY'S OFFICE. 
THAT THERE IS NO WAY HE IS 
SELECTED BUT WE CAN'T TAKE THAT 
RISK. 
IT'S LIKE AN INSURANCE POLICY. 
>>  ON OCTOBER 20TH 2016. 
>>  I CAN'T PULL AWAY. 
I DEFER TO THE CHAIRMAN. 
>>  YOU CAN JUST USE ONE 
LETTER. 
>>  WHY THE F -- WHAT THE F 
HAPPENED TO OUR COUNTRY? 
>>  READ IT AGAIN THAT WAY. 
>>  SIR, DID YOU NOT --  YOU 
JUST WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN? 
OKAY. 
SIR, HAPPY TO IND ULGE. 
I CAN'T PULL AWAY. 
WHAT THE F HAPPENED TO OUR 
COUNTRY? 
>>  WHY IN THE WORLD DO YOU 
BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE 
SHOULD NOT ASK FOR THE RECORD 
OF SIMILAR TEXTS FROM YOUR 
PRIVATE ACCOUNT.  
. 
>>  MAY I ANSWER? 
>>  YOU MAY RESPOND  BRIEFLY. 
>>  WHAT I THINK IS CRITICAL. 
I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP A LOT 
OF THESE. 
I WOULD TAKE. 
>>  I DIDN'T BRING THEM UM. 
I JUST ASKED YOU TO READ YOUR 
OWN WORDS. 
>>  IF I MAY. 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THESE 
TEXTS REPRESENT PERSONAL 
BELIEFS JUST LIKE THOSE THAT 
YOU FIND ON MY PERSONAL PHONE. 
WHAT THEY DO NOT REPRESENT IS 
ANY ACT, ANY SUGGESTION OF AN 
ACT. 
ANY CONSIDERATION THAT WE NEED 
TO DO THIS OR NOT DO THIS AND 
FURTHER MORE I WOULD ENCOURAGE 
YOU AS I BELIEVE I FORGET WHO I 
SAID THIS TO EARLIER THIS 
MORNING. 
YOU NEED TO READ THESE TEXTS IN 
THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WAS GOING 
ON AT THE TIME. 
SO WHEN I MAKE THE COMMENT 
ABOUT TRUMP HAVING NO IDEA HOW 
DESTABILIZING HIS 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE, THAT 
CAME ON THE HEELS OF A SPEECH 
WHERE THEN CANDIDATE TRUMP SAID 
THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR 
NOT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD 
HONOR ITS COMMITMENT TO MUTUAL 
DEFENSE UNDER NATO. 
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT. 
MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
MR. CHAIRMAN. 
IN LIGHT OF THESE. 
NO. 
NO. 
. 
>>  HE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO 
ANSWER. 
>>  EVERYBODY WILL SUSPEND. 
I TOLD HIM THEY COULD ANSWER 
BRIEFLY AND HE D. 
>>  HE HASN'T FINISHED. 
>>  WE WILL NOW TURN TO THE 
WOMAN FROM WASHINGTON DC FOR 
HER QUESTIONS. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
IN ORDER TO ALLOW THIS WITNESS 
TO CONTINUE LET ME ASK -- LET 
ME ASK A QUESTION. 
YOU ARE A SENIOR -- WERE A 
SENIOR AND EXPERIENCED FBI 
STAFF PERSON IS THAT NOT RIGHT? 
>>  I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF A 
SENIOR AND EXPERIENCED FBI 
STAFF PERSON, YES. 
>>  NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE 
LAST ELECTION INVOLVING HILLARY 
CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL, IS THAT NOT THE 
CASE? 
>>  IF YOU MEAN BY HIGHEST 
LEVEL THAT I HAD INTERACTIONS 
WITH THOSE CASES WITH THE 
DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
AND SENIOR STAFF OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YES. 
>>  THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. 
NOW, WE HAVE BEEN READING FROM 
YOUR PERSONAL PHONE AND YOUR -- 
AND YOUR OFFICIAL PHONE. 
DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT YOUR 
PERSONAL POLITICAL MESSAGES -- 
IF THEY BECAME PUBLIC MIGHT BE 
MISUNDERSTOOD IN LIGHT OF YOUR 
ROLE? 
>>  I DIDN'T BECAUSE I NEVER 
THOUGHT THEY WOULD BECOME 
PUBLIC. 
>>  EVEN THOUGH THEY -- SOME OF 
THEM WERE NOT ON YOUR PERSONAL 
PHONE. 
>>  CORRECT. 
I'M -- YES. 
THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  SO THAT MEANS ANYTHING 
THAT'S ON YOUR OFFICIAL PHONE 
OF COURSE BELONGS TO THE 
PUBLIC. 
SO, I JUST WANT TO ESTABLISH 
THAT THIS -- THIS CONFUSION 
BETWEEN YOUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
PHONE IS PART OF OUR PROBLEM 
HERE TODAY. 
NOW, AS WE HOLD THIS HEARING I 
WANT TO NOTE FOR THE RECORD 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON HIS 
WAY TO A VERY CONTROVERSIAL 
MEETING WITH PUTIN. 
LET ME ASK YOU SIR, ABOUT A 
UNDISPUTED FINDING OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND BY 
THAT I MEAN THE CIA, THE NSA, 
THE FBI, THESE PEOPLE DO NOT 
USUALLY SPEAK IN SUCH ABSOLUTE 
TERMS SO HEAR THEM. 
WE ASSESS RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
PUTIN ORDERED AND INFLUENCED 
CAMPAIGN IN 2016 AIMED AT THE 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. 
THEIR GOAL TO UNDERMINE FAITH 
IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AND 
HARM CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. 
WE FURTHER ASSESS PUTIN AND THE 
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT DEVELOPED A 
CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR PRESIDENT 
ELECT TRUMP. 
WE HAVE A HIGH CONFIDENCE IN 
THESE JUDGEMENTS. 
ARE THESE CONCLUSIONS FAMILIAR 
TO YOU? 
>>  THEY ARE. 
>>  ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY 
FINDING THAT UNDERMINES THESE 
CONCLUSIONS OF THE THREE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES? 
>>  I AM NOT. 
>>  THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE CAPITOL UNDER 
THE LEADERSHIP OF A REPUBLICAN 
CHAIRMAN. 
RICHARD BURRR HAS MADE A 
BIPARTISAN FINDING AFFIRMING 
THE ASSESSMENTS AND I WANT TO 
QUOTE JUST BRIEFLY FROM THEM 
THAT THE THREE COMMITTEES -- 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMISSION 
ASSESS MEMBER IS A SOUND 
INTELLIGENCE PRODUCT. 
NOW, LET ME -- INDICATE 
SOMETHING THAT I HAD NOT KNOWN 
BEFORE PREPARING FOR THIS 
HEARING. 
THEY NOT ONLY CITED THE USUAL 
CONTEXT HERE IN THE UNITED 
STATES, THEY QUOTED PUBLIC 
RUSSIAN LEADER MONTEREY, MEDIA 
REPORTS, ALL LINE WITH THE BODY 
OF OUR INTELLIGENCE REPORTING. 
WERE YOU AWARE OF THE 
CONFLUENCE OF WHAT THE RUSSIANS 
WERE SAYING AND WHAT OUR OWN 
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES ARE 
SAYING? 
>>  I BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND YOUR 
QUESTION TO BE BETWEEN THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SOURCES 
AND METHODS AND OPEN SOURCE 
REPORTING, YES I WAS AWARE OF 
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT COMING 
TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME. 
>>  DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO 
BELIEVE THAT THE SENATE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE OR THE 
NSA OR THE CIA OR THE FBI OR 
THE OFFICE OF THE DIVISION OF 
INTELLIGENCE ARE ON SOME KIND 
OF AN EFFORT TO DISCREDIT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
>>  YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED BUT 
YOU MAY ANSWER. 
>>  NO, NOT AT ALL. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>>  YIELDS BACK TO THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN 
INVESTIGATING BOTH THE MATTER 
OF HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL AND 
THE RUSSIAN MATTER IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  AND MRS. PAGE WAS ALSO 
INVOLVED. 
>>  SHE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE 
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM. 
SHE WAS A SENIOR STAFF MEMBER 
FOR MR. MCABB.  
. 
>>> YOU WOULD AGREE THAT BOTH 
INVESTIGATIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO 
BE FAIR AND UNBIASED? 
>>  YES AND THEY WERE. 
>>  YET YOU WERE BOTH ROOTING 
FOR CLINTON TO WIN AND YOU BOTH 
DETESTED DONALD TRUMP, DID YOU 
NOT? 
>>  THINK I THAT'S FAIR TO SAY. 
>>  AND IN FACT AS WE HAVE 
LEARNED YOU APPARENTLY FOUND 
DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS 
DETESTABLE TOO LIKE THOSE 
AROUND VIRGINIA WHO WE HAVE 
HEARD WHO YOU CALLED IGNORANT 
BLANKS, I WON'T SAY THAT HERE 
AND THAT YOU HAD VISITED A WAL-
MART AND COULD SMELL THE TRUMP 
SUPPORT. 
WHEN I READ THOSE 
COMMUNICATIONS AND WHEN I HEAR 
THEM HERE, THOSE BETWEEN THE 
TWO OF YOU SPECIFICALLY WHAT 
YOU HAD TO SAY ABOUT TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS. 
IT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING 
THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD SAID 
ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS. 
SHE FOUND THEM -- WHAT DID THEY 
CALL THEM? 
DEPLORABLES. 
I WOULD SUBMIT THAT IT WAS YOUR 
AND HILLARY CLINTON'S SMUG VIEW 
OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS 
THAT WAS TRULY DEPLORABLE. 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE 
PAYING YOUR SALARIES, PAYING 
FOR A FAIR AND UNBIASED 
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI 
DESERVED A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT 
THOSE COMMENTS I JUST REFERRED 
TO REFLECT? 
>>  TWO THINGS. 
ONE I ABSOLUTELY REGRET THE 
APPEARANCE OF SOME OF THOSE 
TEXTS AND WISH I WOULD HAVE 
SAID OR PHRASED OR NOT SAID 
WHAT I DID. 
TWO I TAKE -- I DISAGREE 
COMPLETELY. 
I NEVER SAID THAT. 
I EXPRESSED NO SUCH THING. 
THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS 
AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. 
>>  WE HEARD THEM HERE. 
LET ME -- I JUST. 
>>  . 
>>  YOU TOLD LISA PAGE AND I 
WILL QUOTE HERE. 
I LOATHE CONGRESS AND SHE 
AGREED. 
YOU ARE PROBABLY IN GOOD 
COMPANY THERE. 
A SURVEY I SAW A WHILE BACK 
ABOUT CONGRESS FOUND US LESS 
POPULAR THAN ROOT CANALS AND 
HEAD LICE THOUGH WE DID BEAT 
OUT PLAYGROUND BULLIES AND 
EBOLA. 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT US. 
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND WHETHER OR 
NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN 
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT YOU ARE 
INVOLVED IN AND WHETHER YOU 
WERE FAIR AND UNBIASED WHEN YOU 
INVESTIGATED BOTH HILLARY 
CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP. 
WOULD YOU AGREE? 
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN 
VERY MUCH. 
LET ME EXPLAIN ABOUT THAT 
COMMENT. 
I HAVE THE YOU MOST RESPECT FOR 
CONGRESS, IT'S ROLE AND 
OVERSIGHT. 
FOR ITS ROLE IN PASSING LAWS 
AND ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS. 
WHAT I WAS STATING IN THAT 
COMMENT WAS THE EFFORTS BY SOME 
TO TURN REAL OVERSIGHT ACTIVITY 
INTO UNWARRANTED. 
>>  WE APPRECIATE. 
>  CRITICISM OF THE FBI FOR THE 
FBI DOING ITS JOB. 
>>  A LOST US UP HERE DON'T 
LIKE CONGRESS TOO. 
>>  I'M SURE. 
>>  A LOT OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON 
THAT. 
MR. STRZOK, YOU WERE REMOVED 
FROM THE INVESTIGATION, 
CORRECT? 
>>  YES. 
>>  FOR THE MOST PART ALL THE 
OTHERS THAT WERE THERE ARE 
STILL THERE, CORRECT? 
>>  I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE 
CURRENT STAFFING. 
>>  LET ME TELL YOU WHO THEY 
ARE. 
GREG ANDRES WHO GAVE A THOUSAND 
DOLLARS TO THE DEMOCRAT RUNNING 
TO HOLD THE SENATE SEAT HELD BY 
OBAMA AND $2,600 TO A DEMOCRAT 
SENATOR AND NONE TO THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN. 
IS HE STILL THERE. 
RUSH ATKINSON WHO DONATED TO 
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND 
NOTHING TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 
HE IS STILL THERE. 
STILL THERE. 
AND ANDREW GOLDSTEIN WHO 
DONATED TO BOTH OBAMA AND 
NOTHING TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
AND ELIZABETH  PRELOBER WHO 
CLERKED FOR TWO LIBERAL SUPREME 
JUSTICES AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE 
OBAMA AND CLINTON CAMPAIGNS, 
STILL THERE AND JAMES -- WHO 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC 
CAMPAIGNS OF MULTIPLE 
CANDIDATES. 
HE GAVE 20,000 TO THE DEMOCRAT 
AND SENATE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES 
AND NOTHING TO THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN. 
I COULD GO ON BUT I'M ALMOST 
OUT OF TIME. 
NINE OF THE 16 INVESTIGATORS 
STILL ON THE CASE GAVE TO HILL 
CLINTON OR OBAMA OR BOTH AND 
NOTHING TO TRUMP. 
SHOULDN'T SUCH A WIDE D ISP A 
RIY GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
CONCERN THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU 
ARE OFF THE TEAM THAT THE 
FAIRNESS AND LACK OF BIAS TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DESERVES AND 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE 
JUST MIGHT BE LACKING HERE? 
>>  YOU MAY ANSWER. 
>>  WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS 
THIS. 
WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO TELL 
PEOPLE IS THIS. 
I HAD AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT 
CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE BY 
ANYBODY STAFFING THE SPECIAL 
COUNCIL'S OFFICE. 
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU AND WHAT I 
WOULD ASK YOU TO RELAY IS THE 
MEN AND WOMEN THAT I SAW, THE 
ATTORNEYS, THE AGENTS, THE 
ANALYSTS WERE THE MOST 
REMARKABLE, BRIGHT, PATRIOTIC, 
HARD WORKING PEOPLE I HAVE HAD 
THE HONOR OF WORKING WITH. 
I WANT YOU TO KNOW AND IF 
PEOPLE BELIEVE ME OR NOT. 
I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE 
EFFORTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE 
UP THE OFFICES OF SPECIAL 
COUNCIL ARE THE BEST IN 
AMERICA.  
. 
>>> GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE IS 
RECOGNIZED. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. 
IF I COULD GIVE YOU A PURPLE 
HEART I WOULD. 
YOU DESERVE ONE. 
THIS HAS BEEN AN ATTACK ON YOU 
IN A WAY TO ATTACK THE RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATION THAT SO TO GET AT 
RUSSIA COLL USION WHICH IS WHAT 
THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE 
LOOKING THE. 
A DIRECT STRIKE AT DEMOCRACY 
AND FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AND 
KEEPING US INDEPENDENT OF WHO 
IS OUR FOE. 
I JUST RETURNED FROM THE OSCE 
IN BERLIN. 
THERE IS LITTLE QUESTION AMONG 
OUR ALLIES AND PEOPLE IN AND 
DIPLOMATS THAT RUSSIA IS TRYING 
TO WREAK HAVOC IN THE BALTI CS, 
IN THE BALKINS. 
THEY TRIED TO USE ASSASSINATION 
TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE  
ELECTIONS. 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN UKRAINE 
CAN CRIM EA, IN GEORGIA. 
THEY ARE THE BAD GUYS. 
YOU HAVE DEDICATED MOST OF YOUR 
LIFE IN WORKING IN COUNTER 
INTELLIGENCE AND ONE OF YOUR 
BIG CASES WAS TRACY ANF FOLEY. 
HOW MANY RUSSIAN FOLKS DID YOU 
EXPOSE? 
>>  THAT WAS A LONG, LARGE 
INVESTIGATION THAT HAD A LARGE 
NUMBER OF EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE 
WORKING ON. 
THERE WERE TEN RUSSIAN PEOPLE 
WORKING HERE. 
I WAS HONORED TO START OUT AND 
THAT RAN A DECADE. 
>>  HOW MANY WERE DEPORTED? 
>>  10 OR  11. 
>>  DID YOU WORK ON RUSSIAN 
MAINLY AT THE FBI? 
>>  AT THAT PERIOD, EARLY ON, 
YES. 
>>  ARE THERE THINGS YOU CAN 
TELL US ABOUT THE RUSSIANS THAT 
MAYBE WE SHOULD KNOW BEFORE THE 
PRESIDENT MEETS WITH MR. PUTIN 
AND HIS VERY GOOD FRIEND AND A 
MAN HE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD 
ABOUT? 
>>  I CAN SPEAK TO MY 
EXPERIENCE AS A NATIONAL 
SECURITY PROFESSIONAL IN THE 
FBI. 
THE RUSSIANS ARE TOP RATE 
ADVERSARI, S IN TERMS OF THEIR 
FIRM INTELLIGENCE, HOW THEY ARE 
ABLE TO USE IT TO ACHIEVE THEIR 
FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL 
SECURITY GOALS. 
MANY OF WHICH YOU REFERENCED. 
THEIR DESIRE, THE THREAT FROM 
NATO TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE 
WESTERN ALLIANCE, TRYING TO 
MINIMIZE THE ROLE AND INFLUENCE 
AND LEADERSHIP OF THE UNITED 
STATES AROUND THE WORLD. 
ATTEMPTING TO MINIMIZE AND 
UNDERMINE THE EXTRAORDINARY 
GREATNESS OF OUR DEMOCRACY, TO 
MAKE IT SEEM PEDESTRIAN AND 
NOTHING SPECIAL AND ON PAR WITH 
THEIR NEAR DICTATORSHIP TO MAKE 
US SEEM LESS. 
THAT'S MY INTELLIGENCE 
PERSPECTIVE. 
I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO GET INTO 
A FOREIGN POLICY. 
>>  THEY ENGAGE IN 
ASSASSINATION? 
>>  THEY DO. 
>>  POLITICAL RIVALS? 
>>  YES. 
>> AND ARREST OF REPORTERS FOR 
MAYBE TALKING AND WRITING ABOUT 
THINGS THAT THE STATE DOESN'T 
BELIEVE? 
>>  YES. 
>>  IT'S NOT AMERICA. 
>>  NOT AT ALL. 
>>  WELL THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY 
WHAT THE INVESTIGATION IS 
LOOKING INTO IS RUSSIAN 
COLLUSION TO INFLUENCE THE 
ELECTION AND OUR POLITICS. 
YOU HAVE DEDICATED YOUR LIFE TO 
WORKING AGAINST THAT TYPE OF 
INVOLVEMENT AND AGAINST THAT 
TYPE OF EFFORT TO SUBVERT OUR 
DEMOCR ACY. 
I THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT YOU 
WOULD BE PUT ON TRIAL AS YOU 
HAVE TODAY. 
THIS DISCUSSION -- THIS 
COMMITTEE MEETING SOMEONE SAID 
WE DON'T WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO 
LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE AND SEE 
THINGS ABOUT THE FBI THAT IS 
PUTTING THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT IN QUESTION AND ON 
THE FRONT PAGE. 
I WOULD SUBMIT TO THIS 
COMMITTEE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE PUTTING THAT ON THE FRONT 
PAGE IS THIS COMMITTEE AND THE 
PEOPLE WHO WON'T ACCEPT WHAT 
THE INVESTIGATOR GENERAL SAID 
THAT THERE WAS NO BIAS INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTIONS OF YOU OR OTHERS 
THAT WERE INVESTIGATED. 
THERE -- THEY FOUND IN EVIDENCE 
THAT THE CONDITION INCLUSIONS 
WOULD AFFECTED BY BIAS OR OTHER 
INPROMISE CONSIDERATIONS, THEY 
WERE DETERMINED ON THE  
PROSECUTOR'S ASSESSMENT. 
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THIS 
HEARING. 
NO REASON AT ALL. 
IT PUT ITSELF ON THE FRONT PAGE 
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND 
AS YOU SAID EARLIER THE 
RUSSIANS ARE LOVING IT. 
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. 
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. 
YOU THINK IT WAS BENGAZI. 
IT WAS A NEVER ENDING 
TELEVISION SHOW FROM CONGRESS 
THAT GOT NOWHERE BUT TRIED TO 
INFLUENCE THE PEOPLE THAT WATCH 
FOX NEWS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS 
IS ABOUT. 
THIS IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE AND 
AS THEY SAY YOU CAN PUT LIP 
STICK ON A PIG BUT THIS IS A 
RUSE TO TRY TO GET TO THE 
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION TO TRY TO 
MAKE PEOPLE THINK IT'S 13 
DEMOCRATS THAT ARE WORKING ON 
THIS AND THEY ARE PREJUDICED 
AND DISCRIMINATING AND BIASED 
BECAUSE THEY JUST AS -- IN THE 
MOVIE -- AS THEY SAID -- A FEW 
GOOD MEN, YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE 
TRUTH. 
THE TRUTH IS THIS IS THE MOST 
CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION EVER AND 
IT'LL BE EXPOSED, THANK GOD. 
I YIELD BACK AND I THANK YOU. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO IS 
RECOGNIZED. 
>>  THANK YOU CLAIRE MAN. 
DID YOU PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION 
TO REPORTERS OR MEDIA PEOPLE 
ABOUT ANYTHING RELATED TO 
TRUMP, RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION IN 
2016, 17 OR 18? 
>>  NO. 
>>  DID THE PRESS EVER TALK TO 
YOU, AGENT STRZOK ABOUT THIS 
APPEARING. 
DID THEY COME TO YOU? 
>>  THIS -- THE TRUMP, RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATION? 
>>  DID THE PRESS EVER COME TO 
YOU? 
I'M ASKING DID YOU TALK TO 
THEM. 
DID THEY COME TO YOU ABOUT 
ANYTHING RELATED TO TRUMP, 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION? 
>>  I RECEIVED A NUMBER OF 
CALLS FROM VARIOUS MEMBERS OF 
THE MEDIA, PARTICULARLY WHEN I 
RETURNED FROM THE OFFICE OF 
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
>>  PRIOR TO GOING ON THE TEAM 
DID YOU GET QUESTIONS FROM THE 
PRESS THAT YOU TOOK? 
>>  NOT THAT I TOOK. 
I REFERRED THEM TO THE OFFICE 
OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS. 
>>  HAVE YOU READ THE DOSSIER? 
>>  I HAVE. 
>>  AND YOU WROTE ABOUT IT TOO, 
DIDN'T YOU? 
>>  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. 
>>  WE HAVE AN E-MAIL YOU SENT. 
IT SHOULD BE THERE. 
IN FRONT OF YOU. 
I WANT TO YOU LOOK. 
IT'S AN E-MAIL YOU WROTE TO 
LISA PAGE, JIM BAKER, AND 
OTHERS. 
SUBJECT LINE IS BUZZ FEED IS 
ABOUT TO PUBLISH THE DOSSIER. 
YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS? 
>>  I AM. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
SAYS THIS. 
COMPARING NOW THE SET IS ONLY 
THE SAME TO WHAT McCAIN HAD, IT 
HAS DIFFERENCES FROM WHAT WAS 
GIVEN TO US BY SIMPSON. 
DID YOU WRITE THAT? 
>>  CONGRESSMAN I -- I -- LET 
ME ANSWER IT THIS WAY. 
IF I COULD ADDRESS THE 
CHAIRMAN. 
OVER THE BREAK I WAS AUTHORIZED 
BY THE GENERAL. 
>>  HANG ON. 
I WANT MY TIME STOPPED. 
>>  I WOULD LIKE. 
>>  THIS IS ALL GOING TO COME 
TOGETHER? 
THE ANSWER. 
>>  IS THERE A QUESTION? 
>>  SOMETHING -- I WANTED TO 
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FROM 
EARLIER. 
>>  WAIT. 
>>  I THINK I'M AWARE OF WHAT 
THE FBI TOLD YOU AND YOU AND I 
WILL HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO 
TALK ABOUT THAT. 
RIGHT NOW THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
OHIO CONTROLS THE TIME. 
>>  YOU WROTE THIS. 
THAT WAS THE QUESTION. 
>>  SO. 
>>  WAIT. 
YOU SEE. 
>>  HERE IS. 
>>  HERE IS THE LINE? 
>>  I DO. 
>>  IT SAYS PETER STRZOK AND 
TOO LISA PAGE AND A LOT OF 
OTHER KEY PEOPLE AT THE FBI. 
DID YOU WRITE IT? 
>>  I DID. 
>>  LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF 
QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. 
IT HAS DIFFERENCES WHAT WAS 
GIVEN TO US BY CORN AND 
SIMPSON. 
WHO IS CORN? 
>>  TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND 
I WOULD LOVE TO AND EVERY PART 
OF ME AND YOU KNOW WHY I WOULD 
WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS 
INFORMATION. 
>>  WHO IS SIMPSON? 
>>  I CANNOT ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
>>  YOU WROTE ABOUT IT. 
IT'S NOW PUBLIC. 
WHO ARE THEY? 
>>  BASED ON DIRECTION BY THE 
FBI, SIR, I AM NOT ABLE TO 
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ONGOING 
INVESTIGATIVE MATTERS. 
>>  I WANT TO FIGURE THIS OUT. 
YOU ARE REFERENCING THREE 
COPIES OF THE DOSSIER. 
THE BUZZ FEED COPY YOU HAVE. 
THE ONE JOHN McCAIN'S STAFF 
GAVE TO YOU AND THE ONE THAT 
YOU SAID YOU GOT FROM CORN AND 
SIMPSON. 
THE ONE McCAIN AND BUZZ FEED 
ARE THE SAME ONES IN YOUR WORDS 
BUT THEY HAVE -- THE CORN AND 
SIMPSON ONE IS DIFFERENT. 
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT. 
>>  IT IS IMPORTANT. 
I WANT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. 
HERE IS THE POSITION THAT I'M 
IN. 
I HAVE. 
>>  LET ME. 
>>  MAY I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? 
>>  MAY THE WITNESS BE 
PERMITTED TO ANSWER? 
>>  MR.-- 
>>  STOP MY TIME AGAIN. 
>>  HE ASKS A QUESTION AND 
DOESN'T LET HIM ASK. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO 
CONTROLS THE TIME. 
>>  I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED THAT I 
MAY STATE THAT I HAVE READ THE 
DOSSIER, THAT I READ IT AS IT 
CAME IN PARTS AND PIECES. 
>>  YOU TOLD MY YOU READ IT. 
I WANT TO KNOW WHO CORN AND 
SIMPSON ARE. 
>>  I HAVE BEEN TOLD I MAY NOT 
STATE. 
>>  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
I GOT THAT. 
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. 
DID YOU EVER TALK TO DAVID 
CORN? 
>>  NO. 
>>  DID YOU TALK TO GLENN 
SIMPSON? 
>>  NO. 
>>  DID YOU TALK TO NELLYOR? 
>>  NO. 
>>  DID YOU TALK TO BRUCE ORR? 
>>  YES. 
>>  WHEN? 
>  MY RECOLLECTION IS BETWEEN 
THREE, POSSIBLY THREE OR FOUR 
OR FIVE TIMES IN THE LATE 2016, 
EARLY 2017 TIME FRAME. 
>>  WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT? 
>>  WE TALKED ABOUT INVESTIGATE 
EVE MATTER THAT HE WAS 
INVOLVED? 
>>  DID YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATION WE ARE FOCUSED O  
HERE? 
>>  MY DIRECTION FROM THE FBI. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
ALL RIGHT. 
I GOT IT. 
I GOT IT. 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE E-MAIL YOU 
SENT THAT YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT. 
ARE THERE THREE COPIES OF THE 
DOSSIER? 
>>  TO BE CLEAR I WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT THIS E-MAIL. 
I WANT NOTHING MORE. 
>>  YOU SAY THAT ALL YOU WANT 
BUT YOU AREN'T TALKING ABOUT 
IT. 
YOU AREN'T ANSWERING MY 
QUESTIONS. 
ARE THERE THREE COPIES? 
>>  THREE COPIES OF WHAT? 
>>  THE McCAIN COPY, THE BUZZ 
FEED COPY AND THE ONE FROM CORN 
AND SIMPSON? 
>>  THE MOST I CAN SAY IS WE 
RECEIVED A VARIETY OF COPIES OF 
AND DIFFERENT TYPES. 
>>  ONE OTHER QUESTION. 
GLENN SIMPSON TESTIFIED IN 
FRONT OF THE SENATE ON  AUGUST 
222,017TH. 
HE WAS ASKED DID ANYONE FROM 
FUSION EVER TALK TO THE FBI? 
HIS RESPONSE, NO. 
NOBODY EVER SPOKE TO THE FBI. 
HERE IS WHAT I DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
IF HE SAYS NOBODY SPOKE TO THE 
FBI, HOW IS THAT YOU HAVE I A 
COPY OF THE DOSIER FROM HIM? 
>>  I NEVER HAD CONTACT WITH 
FUSION, WITH MR. SIMPSON, WITH 
MR. CORN. 
AGAIN. 
SIR. 
>>  REGULAR ORDER. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN WILL HAVE A 
FEW MORE SECONDS SINCE HE WAS 
INTERRUPTED. 
>>  I MEAN -- THIS IS THE 
FRUSTRATION THAT EVERY SINGLE 
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE FEEL 
IS WHEN AGENT STRZOK WON'T 
ANSWER. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL WHEN 
HE WENT ANSWER FUNDAMENTAL 
QUESTIONS LIKE THE GUY IN THE E-
MAIL AND WON'T SAY WHO THEY 
ARE. 
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. 
THAT IS WHERE IT'S GOTTEN TO 
NOW AND IT'S FRUSTRATING AS IT 
CAN GET. 
>>  MAY I RESPOND? 
>>  BRIEFLY. 
>>  IT IS AS FRUSTRATING TO ME 
AS IT IS TO YOU. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I WOULD 
LOVE. 
>>  YOU KNOW WHAT? 
>>  MAY THE WITNESSBE 
PERMITTED TO ANSWER? 
>>  IF. 
>>  GENTLEMAN WILL SUSPEND. 
>>  IF IT'S SO FRUSTRATING 
ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
>>  IF YOU WOULD LET HIM. 
>>  HE HAS NEVER ANSWERED IT. 
WE ARE. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN. 
>>  WE ARE ABILITY. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO TO 
STOP BADGERING. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO 
TIME IS EXPIRED. 
WE ARE ABOUT TO MOVE ON WHERE 
HE CAN ANSWER A QUESTION THAT 
HE REFUSED TO ANSWER EARLIER ON 
ADVICE OF COUNCIL AND I WILL 
YIELD TO. 
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DOING THAT 
RIGHT NOW. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MAY I RESPOND TO MR. JORDON? 
>>  BRIEFLY. 
>>  I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT. 
THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME 
FOR OVERSIGHT AND AS YOU WELL 
KNOW THAT'S AT THE END OF THE 
INVESTIGATION ONCE IT'S OVER. 
I'M CERTAIN CONGRESS WILL 
ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

THE 17TH. 
>>  FAIR ENOUGH. 
I DON'T RECALL. 
>>  WELL CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE 
YOU LETTING ME MAKE THAT CLEAR 
AND AGAIN, THE CONTEXT WHEN YOU 
WOULD NOT ANSWER IT WAS YOU 
USED THE WORD IMPEACHMENT ON 
MAY THE 18TH, 2017 AND YOU USED 
THE WORD IMPEACHMENT ON MAY THE 
22ND, 2017 AND YOUR TESTIMONY 
IS THAT YOU CAN'T RECALL A 
SINGLE INTERVIEW YOU WOULD HAVE 
DONE AS PART OF THAT 
INVESTIGATION THAT WAS SUPPOSED 
TO LEAD TO  IMPEACHMENT. 
I THINK THAT LINE OF 
QUESTIONING I'M GLAD THE FBI 
FINALLY REALIZED IT, A COUPLE 
OF HOURS TO LATE WHEN YOU ARE 
PREJUDGING, NOT JUST A RESULT 
BUT A PUNISHMENT WHICH IS WHAT 
IMPEACHMENT IS, WHEN YOU ARE 
PREJUDGING THE CONVICTION AND 
THE SENTENCING, WHEN YOU HAVE 
NOT DONE A SINGLE INTERVIEW, 
I'M SORRY AGENT STRZOK BUT THAT 
IS LETTING YOUR BIAS IMPACT 
YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGEMENT. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN MAY. 
>>  BRIEFLY. 
>>  SIR, LOOK. 
I NEVER PREJUDGED ANYTHING. 
NOT IN THIS CASE. 
NOT IN ANY OTHERS. 
> 
>>  IMPEACHMENT FOR WHAT? 
> 
>>  POINT OF ORDER. 
>>  WHAT ARE THE RULES. 
>>  WHAT ARE THE RULES? 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN WILL ALLOW 
THE WITNESS. 
>>  A NEW ROUND OF QUESTIONS. 
>>  THEN WE WILL MOVE ON. 
>>  SECOND. 
>>  . 
>>  I WAS GIVEN TIME TO 
RESPOND. 
>>  I HAVE SECTION CHIEFS, UNIT 
CHIEFS, IN THE FIELD, 
SUPERVISORS, AGENTS, PEOPLE WHO 
NORMALLY DO INTERVIEWS, NOT ME. 
IF SOMETHING IS NOTABLE OR HIGH 
LEVEL I MAY BE INVOLVED BUT IT 
WOULD BE RARE IF NEVER THAT I 
WOULD NORMALLY GET OUT THERE 
AND DO INTERVIEWS. 
FIRST OF ALL. 
SECOND, YOU MENTION THE USE OF 
THE WORD IMPEACHMENT. 
THAT WAS USED IN THE CONTEXT OF 
MY NOT KNOWING WHAT THIS WOULD 
LEAD TOO. 
I WAS NOT PREJUDGING 
IMPEACHMENT WHEN I USED THAT 
TERM IT. 
>>  AGENT STRZOK. 
PLEASE. 
>>  IT MAY LEAD ALL THE WAY. 
>>  THANK YOU AGENT STRZOK. 
>>  AGENT STRZOK ARE YOU 
KIDDING ME? 
>>  THANK YOU. 
SPECIAL AGENT STRZOK, I JUST 
CONTINUE TO BE AMAZED AT MY 
COLLEAGUES IN THE MAJORITY ARE 
MORE INTERESTED IN YOUR TEXT 
MESSAGES THAN THEY ARE ABOUT 
THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD 
DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO 
UNDERMINE THE WESTERN ALLIANCE. 
IT JUST AMAZING ME SPECIAL 
AGENT STRZOK AS A COUNTER 
INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST YOU 
KNOW ALL TO WELL THE CONSTANT 
AND GROWING DANGER THAT THE 
RUSSIAN FEDERATION POSES TO 
THIS COUNTRY. 
OUR ALLIESS AND TO DEMOCRACY IN 
GENERAL. 
AT SHOCKING THAT MY COLLEAGUES 
IN THE MAJORITY CONTINUE TO 
RELITIGATE A 2016 ELECTION 
WHILE THE PRESIDENT DOES MORE 
DAMAGE IN THE WESTERN -- TO THE 
WESTERN ALLIANCE THAN THE SUM 
TOTAL OF ALL PREVIOUS RUSSIAN 
AND SOVIET LEADERS COULD HAVE 
DREAMED OF. 
IT'S REMARKABLE THAT MR. TRUMP 
ACCUSED OUR TRUSTED ALLY 
GERMANY OF BEING -- AND I 
QUOTE, TOTALLY UNDER THE 
CONTROL OF RUSSIA. 
I WOULD SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS HALF RIGHT. 
SOMEONE IS TOTALLY UNDER 
CONTROL OF RUSSIA BUT IT'S NOT 
GERMANY. 
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 
LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND EXPLAIN 
WHY NEARLY EVERY DECISION HE 
MAKES AND EVERY WORD HE UTTERS 
WEAKENS OUR KEY FRIENDS, ERODES 
OUR STRAY I CAN ALLIANCES AND 
STRENGTHENS OUR MOST DANGEROUS 
ADVERSARY. 
CAN YOU OFFER AN  EXPRACTICE 
NATION WAS TO WHY THE PRESIDENT 
IS SO EAGER TO PUNISH OUR 
ALLIES PLEASE PUTIN? 
>>  I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO DO 
THAT, NO. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
LET ME MOVE ONTO THE MEETING OF 
JULY -- JUNE THE 9TH. 
2017 IN TRUMP TOWER. 
WE HAVE A SERIES OF E-MAILS IN 
FRONT OF US. 
ONE FROM ROB GOLDSTEIN WHO TOLD 
DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR THAT THE 
CROWN PROSECUTOR OF RUSSIA MET 
WITH  
THIS MORNING AND THIS THEIR 
MEETING OFFERED TO PROVIDE THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH SOME 
OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND 
INFORMATION THAT WOULD 
INCRIMINATE HILLARY AND HER 
DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA. 
>>  WE WANT TO BREAK AWAY AND 
TAKE YOU TO ENGLAND WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY 
HAVE JUST ARRIVED FOR BLACK TIE 
GALA. 
IT'S IN THE PALACE NEAR OXFORD 
AND WHERE WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS 
BORN. 
THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER IS 
HOSTING THE EVENT. 
THEY ARE BEING GREETED BY ROLAY 
GUARDS AND BANDS. 
ITS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF 
SECURITY. 
ALSO PROTESTS AGAINST MR. 
TRUMP'S TRIP.  
. 
>>> WE WANT TO GO BACK CAPITOL 
HILL. 
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE 
PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO THE UNITED 
KINGDOM. 
>>  AGAIN. 
NOT RELATING IT TO ANY 
PARTICULAR EVENT. 
I THINK THE HYPOTHETICAL WOULD 
BE CONCERNING BECAUSE A HOSTILE 
FOREIGN POWER, ONE THAT 
HOSTILITY IS THEIR NATTER ARE 
ADVERSE TO OURS. 
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE 
MEETING OR ATTEMPTING TO WORK 
TOGETHER SUGGESTS A VARIETY OF 
POTENTIAL CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS. 
I THINK IT WOULD GIVE CONCERN 
ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONS AND THE 
ACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED 
AND WHETHER OR NOT -- WHOSE 
INTEREST, WHETHER AMERICA OR 
THAT HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER THEY 
WERE  WORKING TOWARD. 
>>  AND WHEN CAMPAIGNS ARE 
GIVEN DEFENSIVE COUNTER 
INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS THEY 
NORMALLY TOLD TO REPORT FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE ATTEMPTS TO THE 
FBI? 
>>  THAT IS NORMALLY PART OF 
ADVERSIVE BRIEFING, YES. 
>>  I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR YOUR RESPONSES AND YOUR 
PATIENE AND THE HEARING A SORRY 
DISPLAY ON THE PART OF MY 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE 
PUT THE DEFENSE OF THE 
PRESIDENT OVER THE 
RESPONSIBILITY WE IN CONGRESS 
HAVE TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
ALL OF YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF 
YOURSELF AND MR. CHAIRMAN I 
YIELD BACK. 
>>  CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM IOWA, MR. KING 
FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
TO START THIS OFF I WOULD LIKE 
TO YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
SOUTH CAROLINA FOR A BRIEF 
PRESENTATION. 
>>  THANK YOU THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM OHIO. 
DO YOU HAVE YOUR TEXTS IN. 
>>  I DO NOT. 
>>  CAN YOU -- WELL. 
LET ME READ ONE AND YOU TELL ME 
IF YOU RECALL IT. 
ON MAY THE 18TH. 
2017, WHO GIVES A -- I WILL 
GIVE YOU A HINT. 
IT STARTS WITH F, ONE MORE AD 
VERSES AN INVESTIGATION LEADING 
TO -- GUESS WHAT THAT LAST WORD 
IS? 
>>  IT'S IMPEACHMENT. 
>>  IMPEACHMENT. 
THE DAY AFTER THE SPECIAL 
PROSECUTOR WAS APPOINTED. 
HOW ABOUT ON MAY THE 22ND. 
? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TEXT? 
YOU HAVE THAT ONE? 
>>  I DO NOT. 
>>  LET ME SEE IF THIS 
REFRESHES YOUR RECOLLECTION. 
I'M TORN. 
I THINK, NO, I'M MORE 
REPLACEABLE THAN YOU ARE IN 
THIS. 
I'M THE BEST FOR IT BUT THERE 
ARE OTHERS WHO CAN DO IT. 
OKAY. 
YOU ARE DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE 
THIS IS YOURS. 
PLUS, LEAVING IN SC, HAVING 
BEEN IN SV RESULTING IN -- 
GUESS WHAT THAT NEXT WORD IS? 
>>  I'M SURE YOU HAVE IT SIR. 
>>  YOU WROTE IT. 
>>  ARE YOU ASKING ME WHAT IT 
IS? 
> Y. WHAT IS IT? 
>>  IMPEACHMENT. 
>>  IMPEACHMENT. 
FIVE DAYS, FIVE DAYS AFTER THE 
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN 
APPOINTED YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
IMPEACHMENT. 
TWICE. 
I THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
OHIO. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN MAY I RESPOND? 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN. 
>>  AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS 
TIME YOU MAY. 
>>  OVER HERE TO YOUR LEFT AND 
I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT YOU 
HAVE STATED HERE BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE THAT YOU SEPARATED 
OUT YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS ANY 
ACTION THAT YOU TOOK. 
YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I'M 
CONFIDENT. 
AS IMPLAUSIBLE AS THAT SOUNDS 
WE HAVE LISTENED TO THE DEFENSE 
OF THAT ARGUMENT THAT NO MATTER 
HOW BIASED AND HOW PROFANE IN 
THAT BIAS WERE YOU IT DIDN'T 
AFFECT YOUR JUDGEMENTS. 
THAT'S A HARD ARGUMENT TO MAKE 
BUT I RECALL YOUR RESPONSE TO 
MR. DUNCAN OF TENNESSEE ON THAT 
TOPIC AND YOU SAID I DON'T 
AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF MY VIEWS 
AS BIASED. 
DO YOU HOLD WITH THAT POSITION 
THAT YOUR VIEWS NOT BIASED? 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY -- IT 
COLORED YOUR ACTIVITIES AS AN 
AGENT? 
>>  I BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T COLOR 
THEM AND THEY ARE NOT BIASED. 
>>  THE TEXTS THAT YOU 
DELIVERED, THAT HAVE BEEN 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE FOR MOST 
THE DAY DON'T REFLECT A BIAS? 
>>  THEY DON'T. 
WHY? 
BECAUSE. 
>>  NOT A SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE 
OF THE IG HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
DEMONSTRATE A SINGLE ACT. 
>>  NOT ONE. 
>>  NOT ONE INDICATING BIAS. 
>>  RECLAIMING MY TIME. 
ONE THIN THAT YOU FOUND A WAY 
TO WALL OFF YOUR BIAS BUT IT'S 
NOT POSSIBLE TO TAKE UNDER OATH 
AND TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
AND IN COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS 
NOT BIAS. 
IF THERE -- THE EVIDENCE OF 
THIS BIAS IS THROUGHOUT THESE 
DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE. 
LET ME TAKE YOU ANOTHER PLACE. 
WERE YOU -- WERE YOU INVOLVED 
IN THE QUESTIONING OF HILLARY 
CLINTON ON JULY 22,016TH? 
>>  YES I WAS.  
PAUSING BECAUSE -- I THINK 
SECOND OR THIRD. 
IF YOU SAY IT'S THE SECOND IT'S 
THE SECOND. 
>>  SECOND IS THE DATE I 
BELIEVE WE WORK WITH. 
ANY CASE, IN THAT ROOM HOW MANY 
AGENTS WERE IN THAT ROOM? 
>>  THREE INCLUDING ME. 
>>  AND WERE THERE ANY OTHER 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BAN? 
>>  YES. 
>>  WHO? 
>>  FIVE ATTORNEYS THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
>>  FIVE? 
>>  FIVE ATTORNEYS FROM THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FOUR 
THEN FROM THE FBI? 
>>  NO. 
>>  INCLUDING YOU? 
>>  NO. 
EIGHT PEOPLE. 
>>  THREE FBI, FIVE DOJ. 
THEN THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM 
WITH HILLARY CLINTON WERE? 
>>  SECRETARY CLINTON. 
I BELIEVE FOUR OTHER ATTORNEYS. 
FOUR OR FIVE. 
>>  I SEE. 
AND -- DID YOU RECORD ANY OF 
THAT INTERVIEW? 
DID YOU TELL ME HOW LONG IT 
TOOK? 
>>  I -- WE DID NOT RECORD IT. 
RECOLLECTION IS IT TOOK SEVERAL 
HOURS. 
I DON'T RECALL THE TIME. 
>>  WHAT DOCUMENTS WOULD YOU 
HAVE ON THAT? 
>>  AN F302. 
>>  AND HOW MANY OF THOSE EIGHT 
AGENTS OR OFFICERS WERE -- HAD 
THEIR NOTES -- THAT TOOK NOTES 
IN. 
>>  I DON'T KNOW. 
I KNOW. 
I BELIEVE SOME AND I KNOW THAT 
THE TWO AGENTS DID. 
I DON'T RECALL ABOUT THE 
ATTORNEYS. 
>  WHO WERE THE AGENTS? 
>>  THERE WERE TWO OF THE CASE 
AGENTS ASSIGNED TO THE CLINTON 
INVESTIGATION. 
>>  WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES IN. 
>>  FBI POLICY. 
>>  I EXPECTD  THAT ANSWER. 
WE MUST KNOW WHO WAS IN THAT 
ROOM. 
WE MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE 
NOTES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY 
USED TO PUT TOGETHER THE 302 
REPORT. 
DID YOU BRIEF THE DIRECTOR ON 
THAT 302 REPORT? 
>>  TWO THINGS. 
GOING BACK TO THE 301 IT'S 
RELYING ON NOTES BUT ALSO 
DRAFTED BASED ON THE MEMORIES 
OF THE AGENTS PARTICIPATING. 
>>  NOTES AND MEMORY. 
>>  YES. 
MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT I DID 
BRIEF DIRECTOR COMEY ON THE 
RESULTS. 
>>  AND WE WILL BE ASKING FOR 
THE SPECIFICS ON THAT DATA THAT 
YOU ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE AND I 
WOULD ASK THE CHAIRMAN IF YOU 
WOULD BE WILLING TO ISSUE A 
SUBPOENA FOR THE TEXTS THAT MR. 
STRZOK TESTIFIES AS ARE NOT 
WORK RELATED. 
I BELIEVE THERE IS A VERY GOOD 
CHANCE THEY ARE WORK RELATED. 
THE BALANCE OF THIS FOR THE 
INFORMATION ON WHO WAS IN THE 
ROOM ON THAT DATE WHEN CLINTON 
WAS INTERVIEWED, WHICH OFFICERS 
FROM THE FBI, WHICH OFFICERS 
FROM THE DOJ AND LET'S CALL 
THEM TO THIS CONGRESS AND GET 
THEIR TESTIMONY ON WHAT 
HAPPENED INSIDE THAT ROOM. 
>>  WE WILL TAKE YOUR REQUEST 
UNDER ADVISEMENT. 
THE TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
I SAID HE COULD RESPOND. 
>>  YES. 
THANK YOU. 
IF I MAY JUST BRIEFLY TO MR. 
KING. 
FIRST, I AM ASSERTING TO YOU 
THAT MY PERSONAL BELIEF DOES 
NOT -- DID NOT SHOW BIAS. 
EVERY AMERICAN HAS POLITICAL 
BELIEF. 
EVERY SINGLE ONE AND I WOULD 
SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE 
NOT BIASED INDIVIDUALS. 
>>  BY YOUR TESTIMONY I'M FREE 
FROM THAT ALLEGATION FOR LIFE. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN IF I CAN 
RESPOND TO YOU. 
MY MENTIONS OF THE WORD 
IMPEACHMENT IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
TEXTS YOU HAVE PICKED AND 
EXPAND THAT LOOK TO OTHERS YOU 
WILL SEE THAT IN NO WAY DID I 
PREJUDGE THAT OUTCOME. 
WHAT YOU HAVE ADMITTED, OMITTED 
RATHER IS A STATEMENT I MADE 
EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT I'M NOT 
SURE THERE IS A BIG THERE 
THERE. 
WHAT THAT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES 
SIR IS NAH I HAD PREJUDGED 
NOTHING. 
WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES WAS I WAS 
LOOKING AT ONE POTENTIAL 
OUTCOME BEING IMPEACHMENT. 
I WAS ALSO LOOKING AT THE 
OPPOSITE OUTCOME THAT WILL MAY 
BE NOTHING, THERE MAY BE NO 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AT ALL. 
I THINK IT'S FAIR THAT YOU TAKE 
TEXTS AND THE TOTAL CONTEXT IN 
WHICH THEY ARE MADE. 
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA, MR. 
JOHNSON FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
MR. STRZOK YOU WERE -- YOU ARE 
A SPECIAL AGENT FOR THE FBI. 
HOW LONG? 
>>  JUST OVER 20. 
>>  YOU SPENT YOUR PROFESSIONAL 
CAREER AT THE FBI, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  AND THE REPUBLICANS ON THIS 
COMMITTEE SEEM TO BE OBSESSED 
WITH YOUR TEXT MESSAGES BUT 
DURING YOUR LONG CAREER WITH 
THE FBI YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED 
QUITE A BIT MORE THAN JUST 
LEAVING A TEXT MESSAGE TRAIL IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>>  I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF 
WORKING ON EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER 
OF VERY GREAT CASES. 
>>  YOU ROSE THROUGH THE RANKS 
OF THE FBI TO AT ONE POINT 
BECOME CHIEF OF THE COUNTER 
ESPIONAGE SECTION IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>>  YES. 
>> AND YOUR CAREER AT THE FBI 
HAD YOUR APPOINTMENT AS THE 
DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECT EAR OF 
THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE 
DIVISION IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  I HELD THAT. 
I WOULD TELL YOU I'M PROUD TO 
HAVE WORKED AS A DAD IN THE 
HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION. 
>>  DURING YOUR CAREER IN 
COUNTER ESPIONAGE AT THE FBI 
DID YOU LEAD A COUNTER 
INTELLIGENCE OPERATION THAT WAS 
CALLED OPERATION GHOST STORIES? 
>>  I DID NOT LEAD IT. 
I WAS ONE OF THE MANY AGENTS 
WHO STARTED THAT INVESTIGATION 
AND A PAIR OF THE SUBJECTS 
EARLY ON THAT I WAS ONE OF THE 
CASE AGENTS ON. 
>>  YOU WORKED ON IT THROUGHOUT 
THE COURSE OF THAT TEN YEAR 
INVESTIGATION? 
>>  NO. 
JUST AT THE BEGINNING, SEVERAL 
YEARS. 
>>  I SEE. 
YOU WORKED ON MANY OTHER 
COUNTER INTELLIGENCE 
INVESTIGATIONS DURING YOUR 
CAREER AT THE FBI? 
>>  YES. 
THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  OPERATION GHOST STORIES WAS 
A MULTIYEAR COUNTER 
INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION OF A 
NETWORK OF UNITED STATES BASED 
RUSSIAN SPIES WORKING AT COVERT 
AGENTS OF RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE, 
THE AGENCY KNOWN AS SVR, ISN'T 
THAT CORRECT? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  AND THE TARGET OF THAT 
INVESTIGATION WAS A GROUP OF 
COVER T AGENTS WHO WERE LIVING 
IN THE UNITED STATES BE LONG 
TERM DOPE COVER ASSIGNMENTS 
CORRECT? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  YOU HAVE INVESTIGATED A 
NUMBER OF THOSE KINDS OF 
COUNTER OR -- INTELLIGENCE -- 
YOU HAVE PRESIDED OVER A NUMBER 
OF THOSE TYPES OF 
INVESTIGATIONS DURING YOUR TIME 
WITH THE FBI IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  I HAVE, YES. 
>>  AND THESE RUSSIAN AGENTS 
HAVE GOTTEN INTO -- AMERICA, 
SET UP TO BE UNDERCOVER AND 
THEN DEVELOP SOURCES THAT THEY 
CAN USE THEN TO DEVELOP 
INFORMATION AND FUNNEL THAT 
INFORMATION BACK TO RUSSIA, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>>  YES. 
ABOUT THAT INFORMATION FROM THE 
UNITED STATES AND OTHER AREAS. 
>>  AND AS SOON AS YOU FIND ONE 
CELL IF YOU WILL OF RUSSIAN 
SPIES TAKE THEM DOWN, THERE ARE 
OTHER CELLS WORKING THROUGHOUT 
AMERICA, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  THAT'S GENERALLY CORRECT. 
>>  IT WAS YOUR JOB TO KEEP ON 
TOP OF THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY? 
>>  YES. 
>>  YOU LED A TEAM OF FBI 
AGENTS WHO DID NOTHING OTHER 
THAN COUNTER INTELLIGENCE 
INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE FBI, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>>  YES. 
>>  AND YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN 
ARRESTING AND PROSECUTING 
SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS FOR 
ESPIONAGE AND CRIMES AGAINST 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 
>>  ME AS PART OF A LARGE 
NUMBER OF FOLKS, YES. 
>>  AND YOU HAVE GAINED A GREAT 
DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE ABOUT 
RUSSIAN SPYING ACTIVITIES, 
THEIR SOURCES AND METHODS AS 
THEY SEPARATE IN THE UNITED 
STATES AND IN OTHER ALLIED 
NATIONS ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 
>>  CERTAINLY TRUE. 
THEN THE UNITED STATES AND TO A 
LESSER EXTENT OVERSEAS. 
>> AND YOU USED YOUR SKILLS TO 
KEEP AMERICA SAFE? 
>>  I HAVE SIR. 
IT'S MY PROUD -- MY PROUD DUTY 
TO HAVE DONE SO. 
>>  THERE'S A LOT MORE TO YOUR 
CAREER THAN A FEW E-MAILS ISN'T 
THAT CORRECT? 
AND TEXT MESSAGES? 
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 
>>  SO TO BOIL IT DOWN TO THAT 
IS REALLY A DISSERVICE TO YOU. 
I THINK AS OPPOSED TO THE 
REPUBLICANS HERE BEING SO 
DESPERATE TO FIND A WAY TO 
DISCREDIT THE RUSSIA 
INVESTIGATION BY DISCREDITING 
YOU AS A PERSON I THINK RATHER 
THAN THEY DOING THAT WE SHOULD 
BE HONORING YOU FOR THE WORK 
THAT YOU HAVE DONE OVER THE 
LAST 22 YEARS TO KEEP THIS 
NATION SAFE AND THIS HEARING IS 
A RECKLESS ABUSE AND MISUSE OF 
CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY. 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO 
REPUBLICANS FINISHING THE HELL 
UP WITH THIS DAMMED PETER 
STRZOK TEXT MESSAGE 
INVESTIGATION AND WITH THAT I 
WILL YIELD BACK. 
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS FOR FIVE 
MINUTES. 
>>  BE RIGHT HERE. 
MR. STRZOK. 
YOU SAID EARLIER IN THIS 
HEARING THAT YOU WERE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER 
AFFECTING OUR ELECTION. 
YOU RECALL THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY INSPECTOR GENERAL 
HAVING THE INVESTIGATION INTO 
SOMETHING FOUND ON HILLARY 
CLINTON'S E-MAILS. 
>>  I DO NOT. 
>>  LET ME REFRESH YOUR 
RECOLLECTION. 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
INSPECTOR GENERAL SENT HIS 
INVESTIGATOR FRANK RUTGER. 
>>  WE HAVE IT. 
>>  ALONG WITH AN ICIG ATTORNEY 
 
THAT I WON'T NAME AT THIS TIME 
ABOUT SOMETHING THEY HAD FOUND 
ON HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS 
GOING TO AND FROM THE PRIVATE 
UNAUTHORIZED SERVER THAT YOU 
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 
INVESTIGATING. 
NOW DO YOU REMEMBER IT? 
>>  I REMEMBER MEETING MR. 
RETEMPER ON EITHER ONE OR TWO 
OCCASIONS. 
I DID NOT REMEMBER THE SPECIFIC 
CONTENT OR DISCUSSIONS. 
>>  I WILL HELP YOU WITH THAT 
TOO THEN. 
MR. RUTGER REPORTED TO THOSE OF 
YOU, THE FOUR OF YOU THERE IN 
THE PRESENCE OF THE ICIG 
ATTORNEY THAT THEY HAD FOUND 
THIS ITEM ON CLINTON'S E-MAILS 
GOING THROUGH A PRIVATE SERVER 
AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE THE 
ANALYSIS THEY FOUND THAT HER E-
MAILS, EVERY SINGLE ONE EXCEPT 
FOR FOUR, OVER 30,000 OF THEM 
WERE GOING TO AN ADDRESS NOT ON 
THE LIST. 
IT WAS A BIT OF INFORMATION 
THAT WAS SENTING TO AN 
UNAUTHORIZED SOURCE. 
DO YOU RECALL THAT? 
>>  SIR, I DON'T. 
>>  WELL -- IT WENT ONTO 
EXPLAIN IT. 
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. 
YOU THANKED HIM. 
YOU SHOOK HIS HAND BUT THE 
PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WAS GOING 
TO AN UNAUTHORIZED SOURCE THAT 
WAS A FOREIGN ENTITY UNRELATED 
TO RUSSIA AND FROM WHAT YOU 
HAVE SAID HERE YOU DID NOTHING 
MORE THAN NOD AND SHAKE THE 
MAN'S HAND WHEN YOU DIDN'T SEEM 
TO BE ALL THAT CONCERNED ABOUT 
OUR NATIONAL INTEGRITY OF OUR 
ELECTION WHEN IF WAS INVOLVING 
HILLARY CLINTON. 
SO, THE EXAMINATION WAS DONE BY 
THE ICIG AND THEY CAN DOCUMENT 
THAT BUT YOU WERE GIVEN THAT 
INFORMATION AND YOU DID NOTHING 
WITH IT. 
ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND THE 
MOST EGREG RIOUS -- HOROWITZ 
GOT A CALL FOUR TIMES BY 
SOMEONE WANTING TO BRIEF HIM, 
LEAVING MESSAGES, TELLING HIM 
ABOUT THIS AND HE NEVER 
RETURNED THE CALLS. 
HE HAD 500 PAGES OF BIAS THAT 
HE GAVE US AND THEN THREW A 
BONE TO THE DEMOCRATS AND SAID 
WE CAN'T FIND BIAS. 
WHEN YOU HAVE TEXT MESSAGES MR. 
STRZOK THE WAY YOU DO, SAYING 
THE THINGS YOU DID, YOU HAVE 
BEEN BETTER OFF COMING IN AND 
SAYING, LOOK, THAT WAS MY BIAS. 
YOU KIND OF GET AROUND TO THAT 
A BIT WHEN YOU SAY HEY, YOU 
KNOW, EVERYBODY HAS POLITICAL 
VIEWS. 
THOSE ARE CALLED BIASES. 
WE ALL HAVE THEM AND YOU HAVE 
COME IN HERE AND SAID, I HAVE 
NO BIAS. 
YOU DO IT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE 
AND I WATCHED YOU IN THE 
PRIVATE TESTIMONY YOU GAVE. 
I TOLD SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS 
HE IS REALLY GOOD. 
HE IS LYING. 
HE  KNOWS WE KNOW HE IS LYING 
HE PROBABLY PASS A POLYBRAPH. 
>>  POINT OF ORDER. 
THIS POINT OF ORDER. 
>>  NO. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN WILL STATE 
HIS POINT OF ORDER. 
>>  THE MEMBER OF THIS 
COMMITTEE JUST ASSERTED THAT 
THIS WITNESS WHO IS UNDER OATH 
AND A FORMER AGENT OF THE FBI 
LIED. 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT I ASK 
HIM TO WITHDRAW IT. 
>>  I DO NOT WITHDRAW IT. 
HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF CONGRESS 
AND JUST AS YOU HAVE BEEN 
EXPRESSING BIAS THROUGH YOUR 
MEMBERS ABOUT WHAT A HERO HE 
IS. 
>>  WILL NOT A SINGLE PERSON 
WHO HAS. 
>>  GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE 
ISLAND. 
>>  IT'S MY TIME. 
>>  THAT'S A DISGRACE. 
>>  GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE ISLAND 
WILL SUSPEND. 
>>  THE DISGRACE IS WHAT HE HAS 
DONE. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS 
WILL SUSPEND. 
>>  THERE IS THE DISGRACE. 
IT WON'T BE RECAPTURED ANY TIME 
SOON BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE YOU 
HAVE DONE TO THE JUSTICE 
SYSTEM. 
I HAVE TALKED TO FBI AGENTS AND 
YOU HAVE EMBARRASSED THEM, 
YOURSELF, AND I CAN'T HELP BUT 
WONDER WHEN I SEE YOU LOOKING 
THERE WITH A LITTLE SMIRK, HOW 
MANY TIMES DID YOU LOOK SO 
INNOCENT INTO YOUR WIFE'S EYES 
AND LIE TO HER ABOUT LISA PAGE? 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN THIS IS 
OUTAGOUS.
>>  CREDITABILITY OF A WITNESS. 
>> 
>>  YOU NEED YOUR MEDICATION? 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN CONTROLS THE 
TIME. 
>>  ASK THAT THE WITNESS BE 
PERMITTED TO RESPOND. 
>>  HE WILL BE PERMITTED. 
>>  HE WILL BE PERMITTED. 
>>  IF YOU EVER TALK TO CLINTON 
DURING YOUR INVESTIGATION 
BESIDES THE ONE QUESTIONING YOU 
MENTIONED BEFORE THAT OR AFTER 
THAT TO THIS DAY? 
>>  POINT OF ORDER. 
POINT OF ORDER. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN WILL STATE 
HIS POINT OF ORDER. 
>>  IT IS -- I THINK AGAINST 
THE RULES OF THE HOUSE FOR A 
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE TO 
IMPUNE THE CHARACTER OF A 
WITNESS. 
>>  IT IS NOT. 
>>  HE SHOULD ASK REQUEST -- 
THE PURPOSE IS TO ELICIT 
INFORMATION. 
HE SHOULD NOT IMPUNE, THE 
CHARACTER OF THE. 
>>  THE RULES ARE ONLY DIRECTED 
TO MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
>>  IT'S OKAY TO IMPUNE THE 
CHARACTER OF WITNESSES IN. 
>>  I HAD MEMBERS ON YOUR SIDE 
IMMUNE SOMEONE WHO IS COVERED 
BY THE RULES OF THE HOUSE. 
THE GENTLEMAN -- THE GENTLEMAN 
HAS 20 SECONDS LEFT. 
ON. 
HE CAN COMPLETE HIS TIME AND 
THEN THE WITNESS CAN RESPOND. 
>>  SO, IF YOU TALK TO HILLARY 
OTHER THAN CLINTON OTHER THAN 
THE TIME IN FRONT OF THE 
WITNESS? 
> 
>>> . AFTER THROW AWAY WHAT YOU 
HAVE WITH ALL THE BIAS YOU 
HAVE. 
YOU NEVER GOT A THANK YOU? 
I YIELD BACK. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN MAY RESPOND. 
>>  THAT'S -- QUITE A SET OF 
STATEMENTS. 
>>  I DID NOT FINISH WITH A 
QUESTION. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN. 
>>  THERE WAS NO QUESTION 
ASKED. 
>>  HE HAS BEEN GIVEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. 
>>  YACHT WILL SUSPENDS. 
THE TIME HAS EXPIRED AND AS I 
HAVE INDICATED. 
>>  RULES OF OUR HEARINGS ARE 
IF THERE IS A QUESTION ASKED 
DURING THE TIME THE WITNESS MAY 
RESPOND TO THE QUESTION AFTER 
THE TIME. 
>>  THE WITNESS IS GOING TO BE 
ALLOWED TO RESPOND BRIEFLY. 
>>  THAT'S A NEW RULE. 
>>  SIR. 
>>  FIRST, I ASSURE YOU. 
>>  NO QUESTION. 
>>  UNDER OATH AS I SPOKE ALSO 
DURING MY INTERVIEW A WEEK OR 
TWO AGO. 
I HAVE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH. 
THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD ACCUSE 
ME  OTHERWISE AND QUESTION IF 
THAT WAS THE LOOK I WOULD 
ENGAGE WITH IN A FAMILY MEMBER 
WHO I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED HURTING 
GOES MORE TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT 
YOUR CHARACTER AND WHAT YOU 
STAND FOR AND WHAT IS GOING ON 
INSIDE YOU. 
>>  IT'S TO YOUR CREDITABILITY 
AND YOU LOST IT. 
>>  BOTH. 
>>  WHILE I. 
>>  POINT OF ORDER. 
>>  LOST YOUR CREDITABILITY. 
>>  WHILE I DOUBT IT PLAYS WELL 
TO AMERICA. 
. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS 
WILL SUSPEND. 
THE WITNESS HAS HAD OPPORTUNITY 
TO EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS ABOUT 
THAT AND NOW THE CHAIR 
RECOGNIZES. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN THERE IS A 
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE 
REPRESENTATIVE'S FIRST 
ASSERTION ABOUT WHAT THE ICIG 
SAID THAT I WOULD LIKE TO 
RESPOND TOO. 
>>  BRIEFLY. 
>>  VERY BRIEFLY. 
I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THAT 
CONVERSATION. 
I CAN TELL YOU I AM NOT A 
COMPUTER FORENSIC EXPERT. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERY 
ALLEGATION WE HAD AN ICIG WAS A 
GREAT AND CLOSE PART NEAR. 
EVERY ALLEGATION WE HAD WAS 
FORWARDED TO EXPERTS WHO LOOKED 
AT IT. 
THE SCORES AND SCORES OF 
BLACKBERRIES AND EVERYTHING WE 
GOT WERE COMBED OVER DAREFULLY 
TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY. 
>>  YOU DON'T RECALL GOING OVER 
THOSE E-MAILS CORRECT? 
>>  GENTLEMAN WILL SUSPEND. 
>>  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
>>  YOU CAN'T LET A WITNESS GO 
ON FOR EVER WHEN YOU NEVER DID 
ANYTHING. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN. 
ORDER. 
>>  REGULAR ORDER.  
. 
>>  YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT IT. 
>>  SIR. 
IF THERE WAS A LEAD I GAVE IT 
TO THE TEAM. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN. 
>>  THERE WAS NOTHING ALONG. 
>>  MR. STRZOK YOU WILL 
SUSPEND. 
>>  THAT WILL COME OUT. 
>>  THERE GOMER YOU WILL 
SUSPEND. 
I APOLOGIZE. 
I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE RANKING 
MEMBER THAT WE ARE GOING 
COMMITTEE TO COMMITTEE SO THE 
NEXT GENTLEMAN IS THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM VIRGINIA. 
>>  WOW. 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC MAY BE 
FORGIVEN FOR MISTAKING THIS SO-
CALLED HEARING FOR A RUSSIAN 
POLITICAL TRIAL. 
IT'S GOT ALL THE TRAPPINGS. 
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, 
CONNECTING DOTS THAT AREN'T 
MEANT TO BE CONNECTED, CHERRY 
PICKING FACTS, SOMETIMES MAKING 
UP FACTS, IT'S ASTOUNDING, IT'S 
A NEW LOW IN THE UNITED STATES 
CONGRESS. 
WHAT A SHAME. 
MR. STRZOK YOU ARE UNDER OA, 
TH. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE 
BIG REPUBLICAN BEEF IN ORDER TO 
DID DID DISCREDIT YOU AND THE 
FBI AND HOPEFULLY UNDERMINE THE 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, HINGES ON 
THE FACT THAT YOU SENT OUT SOME 
PERSONAL E-MAILS ABOUT YOUR 
POLITICAL VIEWS ON THE THEN 
PENDING 2016 ELECTION, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>>  SIR THAT'S MY 
UNDERSTANDING. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
YOU ARE UNDER OATH. 
I THE FOLLOWING E-MAIL. 
CHARACTER MATTERS, REAL DONALD 
TRUMP WON'T WIN BUT HE COULD 
STILL STEP ASIDE AND LET 
SOMEONE ELSE TRY. 
DID YOU WRITE THAT? 
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE I DID. 
>>  NO YOU DIDN'T. 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR BEN SASSY 
WROTE THAT E-MAIL. 
ANOTHER UNFORGIVABLE SIN. 
HE SHOULD BE HERE AS WELL 
APPARENTLY. 
MY WIFE AND I, WE HAVE A 15-
YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. 
DO YOU THINK I CAN LOOK HER IN 
THE EYE AND TELL THEIR THAT I 
ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE 
ACTS LIKE THIS AND HIS APOLOGY 
THAT WAS NO APOLOGY. 
THAT WAS AN APOLOGY FORGETTING 
CAUGHT. 
I CAN'T TELL THE GOOD POPE ARE 
PEOPLE OF MY STATE THAT I 
ENDORSED A PERSON WHO AC ACTS 
LIKE. 
WAS THAT YOU? 
>>  NO. 
IT WAS A FORMER CHAIRMAN OF MY 
COMMITTEE. 
DID YOU WRITE THE FOLLOWING. 
FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, 
AND TO GIVE THE REPUBLICANS A 
CHANCE AT DEFEATING CLINTON, 
MR. TRUMP SHOULD STEP ASIDE. 
HIS DEFEAT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN 
AND FOUR YEARS OF CLINTON IS 
NOT WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS 
COUNTRY. 
MR. TRUMP SHOULD DO THE RIGHT 
THING? 
THAT'S YOU, RIGHT? 
>>  NO. 
>>  NO. 
YOU ARE RIGHT. 
IT WAS THE REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESSMAN FROM COLORADO. 
DONALD TRUMP SHOULD STEP ASIDE 
AND LET THE PARTY REPLACE HIM 
WITH MIKE PENCE OR ANOTHER 
APPROPRIATE NOMINEE. 
I WOULD NEVER VOTE FOR CLINTON. 
THAT'S YOURS. 
>>  NO. 
>>  NO. 
THAT'S REPUBLICAN BARBARA 
CONSTACK OF VIRGINIA. 
HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. 
IT'S NOW CLEAR TRUMP IS NOT FIT 
TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND CANNOT DEFEAT 
CLINTON. 
I BELIEVE HE SHOULD STEP ASIDE 
AND LET THE GOVERNOR LEAD THE 
TICKET. 
YOU WROTE THAT ONE? 
>>  NO. 
>>  YOU DIDN'T? 
NO YOU ARE RIGHT. 
THAT'S REPUBLICAN BRADLEY BURN 
OF ALABAMA. 
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE? 
TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR MAKES HIM 
UNACCEPTABLE AND I WON'T VOTE 
FOR HIM. 
AS DISAPPOINTED AS I HAVE BEEN 
WITH HIM THROUGHOUT THIS 
CAMPAIGN I THOUGHT SUPPORTING 
THE NOMINEE WAS THE BEST THING 
FOR THE COUNTRY NOW ITS CLEAR 
THAT THE BEST THING IS FOR 
TRUMP TO STEP ASIDE AND ALLOW 
RESPONSIBLE, RESPECTABLE 
REPUBLICANS TO LEAD THE TICKET. 
YOU WROTE THAT ONE. 
>>  NO. 
>>  NO. 
THAT WAS THE REPUBLICAN OF 
ALABAMA. 
I ASK THAT YOU MR. TRUMP WITH 
ALL DUE RESPECT STEP ASIDE. 
STEP DOWN. 
ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO CARRY THE 
BANNER. 
YOU WROTE THAT ONE. 
>>  NO. 
>>  NO YOU ARE RIGHT AGAIN. 
THAT WAS THE REPUBLICAN FROM 
UTAH. 
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU WERE 
WRITING THESE E-MAILS IN THE 
HEAT OF THE CAMPAIGN YOU HAD A 
LOT OF GOOD COMPANY ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE. 
NOW YOU ARE AN ORPHAN. 
I WONDER WHAT CHANGED. 
YOUR OPINION WAS HARDLY A 
STRIKING ONE. 
HARDLY UNUSUAL. 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU AND I LIVE, 
NORTHERN VIRGINIA, IS THAT 
úCOR 
>>  YES. 
>>  SO YOUR SIN OF WRITING AN E-
MAIL CRITICIZING THE CANDIDATE 
TRUMP AND PREDICTING HE WOULD 
LOOSE WAS NOT AN ISOLATED KIND 
OF OPINION IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  NO IT WAS NOT TO MY 
KNOWLEDGE. 
>>  AND DO YOU UNDER OATH 
CONFIRM WHAT THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL SAID THAT THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE YOUR AMERICAN OPINION 
NOT WITH STANDING THAT IN ANY 
WAY TAINTED THE ONGOING 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION? 
>>  I DO. 
>>  THAT ITS YOUR TESTIMONY? 
>>  YES. 
>>  I IT YOU AND I'M SORRY FOR 
THE TREATMENT YOU HAVE RECEIVED 
HERE TODAY. 
AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND THE 
OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM 
COMMITTEE I TAKE NO PLEASURE IN 
WATCHING THIS. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS. 
MR. ME FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
>>  I THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND I 
TAKE NO PLEASURE IN THE 
SELFPITY YOU HAVE SHOWN US. 
I LOVED BEING A PROSECUTE AND 
THE DA'S OFFICE AND I SPENT 22 
YEARS ON THE CRIMINAL BENCH 
TRYING CRIMINAL CASES, SAW 
ABOUT 25,000 FELON CASES. 
I SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM FROM THE 
BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE 
JUSTICE SYSTEM PEOPLE ARE 
INVOLVED IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
THOSE PEOPLE, WHOEVER THEY ARE 
CANNOT BE BIASED, ONE WAY OR 
THE OTHER. 
IS IT IT STARTS IN COURTROOM 
WITH THE JURY. 
THE LAWYERS SEND A LOT OF TIME 
TALKING TO JURORS ABOUT IF THEY 
ARE BIASED BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE BIASED OR APPEAR BIASED ARE 
OUT OF HERE. 
YOU CAN'T SERVE ON THE JURY. 
YOU CANNOT BE FAIR. 
WE DON'T LET JUDGES SERVE ON 
CASES IF THEY HAVE A BIAS. 
THEY ARE  RECUSED. 
THEY DO IT THEMSELVES. 
THEY RECOGNIZE THEY HAVE A BIAS 
AND WE DON'T LET PEOPLE TESTIFY 
UNLESS THE BIASED WHEN THEY 
TESTIFY IS ALLOWED TO BE 
BROUGHT OUT. 
IF A WITNESS IS TESTIFYING 
LET'S SAY YOU FOR EXAMPLE. 
BOTH SIDES ARE ENTITLED TO 
BRING OUT THE BIAS FOR OR 
AGAINST  THE -- ABOUT THE 
WITNESS THAT IS AGAINST THE 
OFFENDER, LET'S USE IN THAT 
CASE BECAUSE IN OUR JUSTICE 
SYSTEM THINGS MUST BE FAIR AND 
THINGS MUST LOOK FAIR. 
THERE MUST NOT BE BIAS AND 
THERE MUST NOT BE A LOOK OF 
BIAS BY ANYONE. 
THAT IS THE WAY OUR SYSTEM 
WORKS. 
NOW, IN MY OPINION WHO HAS -- 
MY OPINION IS NOT BETTER THAN 
ANYONE ELSE US BUT I HAVE SEEN 
A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS. 
KIND OF IN THE PEOPLE BUSINESS, 
JUDGING PEOPLE. 
I HAVE HEARD YOUR STATEMENTS TO 
TODAY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT 
YOUR OWN WORDS HAVE SHOWN YOUR 
BIAS. 
YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT BIASED BUT 
WE BASE THINGS ON EVIDENCE, NOT 
BASED NECESSARILY ON WORDS. 
YOUR WORDS TO ME PROVE YOUR 
BIAS. 
YOUR ATTITUDE PROVES YOUR BIAS. 
YOUR ARROGANCE PROVES YOUR BIAS 
AND I THINK YOUR PROTESTING TO 
MUCH PROVES YOUR BIAS. 
BEING THAT AS IT MAY THE SCARY 
PART OF THAT IS NOT IF YOU ARE 
BIASED OR NOT, THE SCARY PART 
OF IT IS WHAT ABOUT OTHER 
PEOPLE IN THE FBI? 
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT THAT HAVE THE SAME 
ATTITUDE THAT YOU DO ABOUT 
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING 
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI? 
THAT IS WHAT IS SCARY BECAUSE 
PEOPLE OUT HERE, THE REST OF US 
WHO DON'T GET TO WORK FOR THE 
FBI OR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR 
JUSTICE SYSTEM DOING THE RIGHT 
THING FOR THE RIGHT REASON. 
MAKING SURE THAT OUR JUSTICE 
SYSTEM IS JUST AND PART OF THE 
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE IS THAT 
THERE ISN'T A BIAS FOR OR 
AGAINST ANYONE AS THEY GO 
THROUGH THE SYSTEM. 
NOW, BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID I 
DON'T THINK I WOULD EVER ALLOW 
YOU AS A JUROR TO BE ON A 
CRIMINAL CASE. 
EVER. 
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE DEFENSOR 
ATTORNEY OR THE PROSECUTOR 
WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BE ON A 
JUROR BECAUSE YOUR WORDS ARE 
WHAT WE HEAR. 
YOUR PROTESTING JUST SEEMS TO 
MAKE THOSE WORDS MORE OF A SHOW 
OF YOUR BIAS. 
THE COMMENT THAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO STOP HIM. 
THAT NOT ONLY SHOWS YOUR BIAS, 
THAT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO ACT ON IT AND YOU ARE GOING 
TO STOP PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
THAT'S THE WAY IT COMES ACROSS. 
THE EVIDENCECOMES ACROSS. 
SO, HOW DO YOU ASSURE US THAT 
THE ATTITUDE THAT YOU HAVE 
SHOWN US TODAY OF THE TEXT 
MESSAGES AND ALL OF THIS THINGS 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT, HOW DO WE KNOW THAT'S 
NOT RAMPANT THROUGHOUT THE FBI? 
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? 
>>  SIR, WHAT I WOULD ANSWER TO 
YOU. 
>>  YOU CAN ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION? 
HOW DO WE KNOW THERE ISN'T BIAS 
IN THE FBI AND THIS PARTICULAR 
INVESTIGATION OR OTHER 
INVESTIGATIONS? 
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? 
>>  THE WAY THAT YOU DO THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SUGGESTED. 
YOU LOOK TO THE EVIDENCE. 
YOU LOOK TO THE ACTIONS OF THE 
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FBI AND 
THE CONDUCT OF THE CASES. 
YOU LOOK TO MY ACTIONS IN THE 
CONDUCT OF THE INVESTIGATIONS. 
YOU HAVE DONE WITH OTHERS A 
FANTASTIC JOB OF PUTTING THE 
WORD BIAS WITH PERSONAL 
POLITICAL BELIEF AND IT'S 
ASTOUNDING HOW EFFECTIVE THAT'S 
BEEN. 
YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. 
THE FACT OF BIAS. 
>>  RECLAIMING MY TIME. 
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO TRY 
TO ANSWER THE OTHER QUESTION 
THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ANSWER. 
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE 
ATTITUDE THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN US 
TODAY, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO 
CALL IT. 
SOME WANT TO MAKE A SAINT OUT 
OF YOU. 
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE FEUD 
ISN'T THE SAME ONE OF THE FBI? 
>>  I WOULD ASK THAT THE 
WITNESS BE PERMITTED TO ANSWER. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN MAY ANSWER. 
>>  HOPEFULLY WOULDN'T 
INTERRUPTION. 
>>  THE WAY YOU JUDGE THAT IS 
WHAT I SAID. 
YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. 
YOU LOOK AT THE ACTS, WHAT FBI 
AGENTS AND ANALYSTS AND 
EVERYBODY ELSE DO. 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT I DID. 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL CONCLUDED, NOT ONLY ME 
BUT ALL OF THE AGENTS AND 
ASSISTANT DIRECTORS AND 
EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THE 
INVESTIGATION AND YOU SEE THAT 
THEVIDENCE IS THERE IS NO ACT 
OF BIAS. 
SO THIS FALSE ASSERTION THAT 
YOU ARE MAKING THAT POLITICAL, 
PERSONAL BELIEF MUST EQUAL 
BIAS, THAT SOMEHOW WE HAVE 
MERGED THOSE TWO WORDS TOGETHER 
IS ONE OF THE TRIUMPHS OF 
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THAT I 
CAN'T DYSTIMBRIA WITH MORE. 
A JUDGE ASKS JURORS ARE YOU 
ABLE TO SET ASIDE YOUR PERSONAL 
OPINIONS AND RENDER A JUDGEMENT 
BASED ON THE FACTS IN YOU KNOW 
THAT BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE. 
WHAT I AM TELLING YOU IS THAT I 
AND THE OTHER MEN AND WOMEN OF 
THE FBI, EVERY DAY TAKE OUR 
PERSONAL BELIEFS AND SET THOSE 
ASIDE IN PURSUIT OF THE TRUTH 
WHERE IT LIES, WHATEVER IT IS. 
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. 
>>  TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES 
GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA. 
>>  I THANK THE CHAIRMAN. 
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT'S 
GOING ON HERE. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT. 
THAT'S CLEAR. 
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS JOINT 
COMMITTEE AND IN THE COMMITTEE 
MEETING JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
BACK WITH MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
DEMEANING THEMSELVES BY  
ASSERTING THAT THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAT THERE 
UNDER OATH AND LIED, TODAY 
REPEATED ASSERTIONS THAT MR. 
STRZOK IS SITTING BEFORE US 
UNDER OATH AND LYING TO US THE 
EFFORTS TO IMPUNE THE 
CREDITABILITY OF MR. STRZOK AND 
THE ENTIRE FBI. 
IT'S SHAMEFUL. 
TRULY SHAMEFUL. 
THE DEPTHS TO WHICH SOME OF MY 
COLLEAGUES HAVE PLUMMETED IN 
ORDER TO ADVANCE A NARATIVE TO 
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S 
OPPOSITION TO AN INVESTIGATION 
WHICH IS AN INVESTIGATION AS 
MR. STRZOK POINTED OUT AND AS 
TO MANY OF US SEEM TO HAVE 
FORGOTTEN IS AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE RUSSIANS EFFORTS TO 
DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRACY OF 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? 
I WISH THAT THE ATTACKS THAT 
HAVE BEEN LEVELED AGAINST MR. 
STRZOK, THE ATTACKS ON OUR FBI  
DIRECTOR. 
I WISH THERE WAS A SLIGHT 
DEGREE OF THAT DIRECTED AGAINST 
WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID IN 2016 
SO WE COULD TO BOTTOM OF THAT 
AND ANTICIPATE WHAT THEY ARE 
TRYING TO DO THIS NOVEMBER AND 
IN 2020. 
NOW, MR. STRZOK, THIS IS THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. 
THE NUMBER ONE FINDING IN THIS 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT IS 
THAT THE FBI SHOULDN'T DISCUSS 
ONGOING CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
THAT IS WHAT THE IG SAID 
DIRECTOR COMEY DID WRONG. 
THE IG SAID HE SHOULDN'T HAVE 
DONE IT. 
THEY WENT INTO GREAT DETAIL 
ABOUT THE LONGSTANDING PRACTICE 
AND THE REASONS FOR THAT 
PRACTICE TO PROTECT THE 
INTEGRITY OF ONGOING CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATIONS, IN THIS CASE 
THE INVESTIGATION THAT I JUST 
REFERRED TO AND DIRECT ATTACK 
BY A FOREIGN GROUP. 
LISTENING TO MY REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES, IT'S ALMOST AS IF 
THEY NEVER READ THE REPORT. 
LIKE YOU NEVER BOTHERED TO PICK 
IT UP OR WORSE, YOU READ IT AND 
UNDERSTAND IT BUT DON'T CARE. 
YOU ARE ASKING MR. STRZOK TO DO 
EXACTLY WHAT THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL SAID NOT TO DO. 
EXACTLY. 
MR. STRZOK IF YOU ANSWER THESE 
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED 
ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION ARE 
YOU CONCERNED THAT THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL COULD 
INVESTIGATE YOU AND ISSUE A 
REPORT JUST LIKE THIS ONE THAT 
SAYS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE 
DONE THAT? 
>>  I CERTAINLY -- THAT'S 
POSSIBLE. 
I WOULD BE MORE WORRY ABOUT THE 
IMPACT ON THE ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION. 
>>  I UNDERSTAND. 
IT'S A RIDICULOUS POSITION TO 
PUT YOU IN. 
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL EXPLAINED 
IN THIS NEARLY 600 PAGE REPORT 
THAT THE MISTAKE DIRECTOR COMEY 
MADE WAS DISCUSSING THE ONGOING 
STEPS THE FBI WAS TAKING IN THE 
CLINTON INVESTIGATION. 
WE HAVE HEARD THIS FROM THE 
CHAIRMAN, FROM MY COLLEAGUES, 
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES. 
YOU CAN IGNORE THE FBI'S POLICY 
THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO 
PROTECT THESE INVESTIGATIONS 
AND I WILL LET YOU TALK ABOUT 
THAT IN A SECOND AND ANSWER THE 
QUESTIONS IN WHICH CASE MAYBE 
YOU TRIGGER AN IG REPORT OR YOU 
DON'T ANSWER THEM AND MAYBE WE 
HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT. 
NOW, CAN YOU JUST AGAIN SINCE 
THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY LONG 
DAY, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY IT'S 
IMPORTANT NOT TO INTERFERE 
WITHON GOING CRIMINAL MATTERS? 
>>  THERE ARE A VARIETY AND I'M 
SURE I WON'T HAVE ALL THE 
REASONS BUT THE FIRST IS WE DO 
A LOT OF INVESTIGATIONS WHERE 
WE NEVER CHARGE ANYONE. 
IT'S NOT FAI TO GIVEN THE 
INVESTIGATE I'VE POWER WE HAVE 
TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT 
NECESSARILY TARNISH THEM OR 
IMAGE. 
TWO TALKING ABOUT IT'LL MESS UP 
A LOT OF THINGS, TALKING TO 
WITNESSES TALKING TO THE 
SUBJECT. 
AND THEN FINALLY YOU WANT 
SOMEONE TO HAVE A FAIR TRIAL. 
IF WE ARE TALKING ABILITY IT OR 
PUTTING OUR FINGER ON THE 
SKILL, IT WOULD BE 
INAPPROPRIATE AND AGAINST WHAT 
WE HAVE STAND FOR. 
>>  AND THE NEGATIVE 
CONSEQUENCES ON THE OUTCOME OF 
THE INVESTIGATION? 
THAT WOULD BE HUGE. 
THAT WOULD -- IMPACT THE 
ABILITY TO GET A FAIR TRIAL, TO 
CONDUCT A COMPETENT 
INVESTIGATION. 
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT LAST 
COMMENT. 
I WOULD JUST URGE MY COLLEAGUES 
THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS 
APOPLEXY THAT SEEMS TO BE 
BREAKING OUT THAT WE REMEMBER 
THAT WHAT WE ARE REALLY TRYING 
TO DO HERE IS GET TO THE TRUTH. 
THE TRUTH THAT WE NEED TO GET 
TO IS WHAT A HOSTILE FOREIGN 
GROUP DID TO INTERFERE WITH OUR 
DEMOCRACY. 
LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE 
MOVE FORWARD. 
LET'S MAKE THAT THE FOCUS. 
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
ARE EXPECTING. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE COUNTING 
ON US TO DO. 
LET THIS INVESTIGATION GO 
FORWARD. 
LET'S GET TO THE TRUTH. 
I YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF MY 
TIME. 
>>  THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
>>  MR. STRZOK. 
I HAVE HERE AND I'M SURE YOU 
ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT, THE 
ETHICS HANDBOOK OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OF WHICH 
THE FBI FALLS UNDER. 
>>  YES. 
>>  AND THERE ARE SEVERAL 
PARAGRAPHS THAT I WANT TO READ 
TO YOU. 
FIRST ONE IS GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
OF ETHICAL CONDUCT, CONTINUED, 
EMPLOYEES WILL WORK TO AVOID 
ANY ACTIONS CREATING THE 
APPEARANCE THAT THEY ARE 
VIOLATING THE LAW OR THE 
ETHICAL STANDARDS SET FORTH. 
WHETHER PARTICULAR 
CIRCUMSTANCES CREATE AN 
APPEARANCE THAT THE LAW OR THE 
STANDARDS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED 
WILL BE DETERMINED FROM THE 
PERSPECTIVE OF A REASONABLE 
PERSON WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE RELEVANT FACTS. 
NEXT ONE IS APPEARANCE -- 
EMPLOYEE SHOULD AVOID ANY 
ACTION SHOWING THE APPEARANCE 
THAT THE EMPLOYEE IS VIOLATING 
THE LAW OR THE ETHICAL 
STANDARDS SET FORTH IN THESE 
GUIDELINES. 
FURTHER MORE IT STATES FOR 
EMPLOYEES FOR WHOM A SECURITY 
CLEARANCE IS REQUIRED AND YOU 
DO HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE, 
CORRECT? 
>>  TODAY I DO. 
YES. 
>>  YOU HAVE HAD ONE FOR QUITE 
A WHILE OTHER THAN THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
>>  YES. 
>>  FOR PERFORMANCE OF THEIR 
OFFICIAL DUTIES, PROHIBITING 
CONDUCT AND MORE MAY BE GROUNDS 
FOR SUSPENSION, REMOVAL OF A 
CLEARANCE. 
THIS COULD ALSO RESULT IN 
ADVERSE DISCIPLINE ACTION 
INCLUDING SUSPENSION OR 
REMOVAL. 
UNDER THE HATCH AXE ALL FEDERAL 
EMPLOYEES MAY -- POLITICAL 
ACTIVITIES BY FEDERAL EMPLOYEES 
IS RESTRICTED. 
AN EMPLOYEE AND I WANT TO YOU 
LISTEN TO THIS CAREFULLY, 
SERVING IN CERTAIN POSITIONS 
ARE MORE RESTRICTED THAN 
OTHERS. 
THINK YOU WERE A PERSON THAT 
FALLS IN TO THAT CATEGORY AS 
WELL. 
I AM JUST -- DISHEARTENED ABOUT 
THE SITUATION THAT YOU ARE IN. 
I SAY THIS WITH NO PREJUDICE 
AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE -- 
YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY. 
YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR 
EVERYTHING. 
YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE THAT IS 
VERY OBVIOUS TODAY AND YOU ARE 
THE KIND OF WITNESS THAT YOU 
AND I AS A PROSECUTOR FOR 18 
YEARS, A DA AND A UNITED STATES 
ATTORNEY WOULD LOVE TO GET ON 
THE STAND. 
THE REASONABLENESS OF THE 
STATEMENTS THAT YOU MADE AND 
I'M NOT GOING TO GET IN TO THE 
LANGUAGE BUT THE REPETTIVENESS 
OF IT, WHERE WAS YOUR 
JUDGEMENT? 
WHAT WERE YOU NOT THINKING WHEN 
YOU WERE SENDING THE E-MAILS 
AND THE STATEMENTS THAT YOU 
MADE AND THE COMMENTS OF -- IN 
THAT -- OF THE PEOPLE IN 
VIRGINIA? 
I WOULD EXPECT SOMEONE OF YOUR 
CAL IB ER TO BE WAY ABOVE THAT. 
YOU GOT CARRIED AWAY. 
YOU GOT IMPRESSED WITH YOURSELF 
AND YOU ARE IN A POSITION THAT 
I'M SORRY THAT IS THE CASE. 
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DRAW A 
DISTINCTION, A WIDE ONE BETWEEN 
BIAS AND POLITICAL OPINION 
THERE IS NOT THE WIDE 
DISTINCTION THAT YOU ARE 
DRAWING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I 
WOULD BET THE FARM THAT IF YOU 
WERE SITTING NEXT TO ME AS THE 
INVESTIGATING PROSECUTOR AND I 
WAS THE PROSECUTOR AND ANOTHER 
JUDGE WERE HANDLING A CASE 
WHETHER CIVIL OR CRIMINAL, WE 
WOULD BE POINTING OUT THE 
BIASES THAT I SEE THAT YOU HAVE 
SHOWN HERE. 
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR 
JUDGEMENT BASED ON YOUR 
BACKGROUND AND YOU MAY RESPOND 
TO THAT. 
>>  I -- I APPRECIATE YOUR 
COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR 
CONCERN. 
THE FIRST THING I WOULD TELL 
YOU IS I -- I'M -- I'M 
DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DID NOT 
UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF REGRET 
THAT I EXPRESSED FROM THE HARM 
AND DAMAGE THAT THIS HAS CAUSED 
TO PEOPLE I LOVE. 
>>  I DO UNDERSTAND THAT NOW. 
I DO BUT IT'S IN H IND SIGHT. 
PEOPLE LIKE AND YOU I THAT ARE 
HERE TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, 
WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF THIS 
BEFORE. 
>>  CONGRESSMAN. 
WITHOUT QUESTION. 
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY FREE WITH 
YOU THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT 
I REGRET LOOKING BACK. 
I HOPE THAT COME ACROSS TODAY. 
I KNOW A LARGE PORTION OF TODAY 
HAS BEEN COMBATIVE IN A WAY 
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY 
SENSE OF REGRET AND REMORSE. 
I WOULD DRAW SINCE YOU BROUGHT 
IT UP, I WOULD NOTE THAT IN 
THAT MANUAL EVERY FBI EMPLOYEE, 
DOJ EMPLOYEES, ARE RESTRICTED 
BUT WITH IN THAT CATEGORY IF 
YOU READ THAT MANUAL SITING THE 
HATCH ACT IT SAYS EXCEPT FOR 
PROHIBITED EMPLOYEES MAY NOT 
ONLY HAVE POLITICAL OPINIONS 
BUT THEY ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
EXPRESS THEM. 
>>  I KNOW IT WELL. 
>>  I DON'T DRAW ANY 
DISAGREEMENT WITH YOU ABOUT 
BIAS WHERE IT HAPPENS. 
WHAT I DISAGREE WITH YOU AND SO 
MANY PEOPLE TODAY IS THAT 
POLITICAL BELIEF DOESN'T EQUATE 
TO BIAS. 
WE HAVE TO GO TO THE EVIDENCE.  
THIS COMMITTEE. 
ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE 
LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKS AND 
NOT A SINGLE ACT TELLS ME THAT 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
REALLY COMPETENT PEOPLE HAVE 
LOOKED FOR IT. 
BEYOND ME SAYING THAT I KNOW IT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
IT'S NOT JUST ME. 
IT'S THIS ENTIRE GROUP OF FOLKS 
LOOKING AT IT, OF STRUCTURE OF 
THE FBI WHO IS BUILT NOT TO DO 
THOSE THINGS AND NOT TO ALLOW 
IT. 
>>  THE TIME OF THE GENTLEMAN 
HAS EXPIRED. 
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM ILLINOIS. 
>>  I KNOW ITS BEEN A LONG DAY 
FOR YOU. 
I WILL KEEP IT SIMPLE. 
SOME QUESTIONS WILL BE 
REPEATING. 
IN YOUR TIME AT THE FBI HAVE 
YOU INVESTIGATED A MEMBER OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? 
>>  YES. 
>>  DID ANY OF THOSE 
INVESTIGATIONS RESULT IN AN 
INDICTMENT? 
>>  NO. 
>>  HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED 
ANYONE THAT IDENTIFIED AS 
INDEPENDENT OR UNASSOCIATED 
WITH EITHER OF THE TWO MAJOR 
PARTIES? 
>>  I DON'T KNOW. 
>>  YOU DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF 
THOSE RE. 
>>  I DON'T KNOW -- I KNOW -- 
I'M THINKING OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY SECRETARY CLINTON WAS 
PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
I DON'T TEND TO BEYOND THAT. 
I'M NOT A PUBLIC CORRUPTION 
AGENT AND POLITICAL ASSOCIATION 
IS NOT SOMETHING WE LOOKED AT. 
>>  BUT IN YOUR ASSESSMENT 
WOULD YOUR WORK HISTORY SUGGEST 
A BIAS BY YOU TOWARD ANY ONE 
PARTY? 
>>  NO. 
>>  YOU INVESTIGATED AS YOU 
SAID SECRETARY CLINTON FOR USE 
OF PRIVATE E-MAILS. 
>>  YES. 
>>  SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
>>  YES. 
>>  WE KNOW YOU HAVE 
INVESTIGATED A REPUBLICAN 
PROVIDED YOUR PARTICIPATION IN 
THE ONGOING RUSSIA 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE KNOW THAT INVESTIGATION HAS 
LED TO AN INDICTMENT. 
IN FACT IT HAS LED TO 19 
INDICTMENTS, FIVE GUILTY PLEAS 
AND A HOST OF CHARGES FILED 
AGAINST FORMER CAMPAIGN AND 
WHITE HOUSE ADVISERS TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL AS 
RUSSIAN NATIONALS AND 
COMPANIES. 
IS THIS FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU 
HAVE INVESTIGATED AND INDICTED 
INDIVIDUALS FROM THE POLITICAL 
SPECTRUM? 
>>  YES. 
WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
IT'S A FAIR ASSUMPTION. 
>>  NEWS REPORTS HAVE BEEN THAT 
IV, NKA TRUMP, STEVEN MILLER 
AND STEVEN BANNER ALL USED 
PRIVATE E-MAIL TO CONDUCT 
OFFICIAL BUSINESS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A 
REPUBLICAN. 
CORRECT? 
>>  YES. 
>>  SO THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE 
KEY STAFFERS FOR A REPUBLICAN 
PRESIDENT YES? 
>>  YES. 
>>  THESE INDIVIDUALS SERVE OR 
SERVED AS SENIOR ADVISORS TO 
THE PRESIDENT, WHITE HOUSE 
CHIEF STRATEGIST, CHIEF OF 
STAFF AND DIRECTOR OF THE 
NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL. 
IT IS SAFE TO SEE YOU THAT 
INDIVIDUALS IN SUCH HIGH 
RANKING POSITIONS ARE EXPOSED 
TO SENSITIVE, PERHAPS TOP 
SECRET MATERIAL. 
>>  YES. 
>>  TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE HAS THE 
FBI OPENED INVESTIGATIONS 
AGAINST A USE OF PRIVATE E-
MAILS FOR OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE 
BUSINESS? 
>>  I WILL ANSWER THAT. 
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT BASED ON IF 
THEY WERE ONGOING. 
IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR 
ME TO TALK ABOUT THEM. 
>>  OKAY. 
I WOULD, LIKE, TO NOTE THAT 
NIGHT THE HOUSE COMMITTEE OFFER 
OR NIGHT AND REFORM SIS HAVE 
OPEN HEARINGS ON THAT ISSUE AND 
SEVERAL OF THOSE NAMED CONTINUE 
TO ADVISE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES AND RECEIVE A 
PAYCHECK PAID BY OUR TAX 
DOLLARS. 
ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WHEN 
PEOPLE CALL MY OFFICE THEY ARE 
DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, 
INDEPENDENTS AND THEY AREN'T 
INVOLVED LIKE ALL OF US. 
IF YOU ASK THEM I'M SURE THEY 
WOULD SAY THEY RECEIVED TOP 
NOTCH SERVICE FROM MY OFFICE 
AND I HAVE MY BIASES LIKE 
EVERYBODY ELSE LIKE WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT. 
LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION 
TODAY I HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT 
SOME OF MY REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES, NOT EVERYBODY BUT 
SINCE YOU APPARENTLY THINK THAT 
BIASES PREVENT PEOPLE FROM 
DOING THEIR BEST JOB IT MAKES 
ME WONDER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 
DEMOCRATS CALL YOUR OFFICE. 
DO YOU NOT GIVE THEM THE SAME 
SERVICE AS YOU GIVE YOUR 
REPUBLICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU KEEP SUGGESTING 
OVER AND OVER AND OVER. 
I YIELD BACK. 
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. 
MR. SANFORD FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
>>> I APPRECIATE CHAIRMAN AND 
IF I MAY I WILL YIELD MY TIME 
TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM OHIO. 
>>  AGENT STRZOK I WANT TO GO 
BACK TO THIS E-MAIL REGARDING 
THE BUZZ FEED PUBLISHING OF THE 
DOSSIER. 
YOU HAVE THAT? 
>>  I DO. 
MY LAST ROUND OF QUESTIONING 
YOU SAID THAT YOU SPOKE TO 
BRUCE ORR SEVERAL TIMES IN THE 
2016, 2017 TIME PERIOD. 
IS THAT ACCURATE? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  AND AT THE TIME YOU WERE 
WORKING WITH MR. ORR DID YOU 
KNOW THAT HE WAS MEETING WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM FUSION 
INCLUDING GLENN SIMPSON? 
>>  MY I CONSULT WITH  CON
UNSEL? 
>>  YOU SURE CAN. 
HOLD MY TIME, PLEASE.  
I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR 
QUESTION BUT AT THE DIRECTION 
OF THE FBI I DID NOT DISCUSS 
THE CONTENT. 
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT. 
AT THE TIME OF YOUR MEETING 
BRUCE OAR DID YOU KNOW THAT HIS 
WIFE WORKED FOR FUSION? 
>>  AGAIN -- I BELIEVE THE SAME 
ANSWER. 
STAND BY AGAIN, SORRY ABOUT THE 
TIME.  
. 
>>> IT SOUNDS LIKE IN YOUR E-
MAIL YOU ARE SAYING COMPARING 
NOW, SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE 
THREE COPIES BUT TWO DIFFERENT 
VERSIONS. 
THE SET YOU WERE LOOKING AT AND 
REFERENCES TO YOUR COLLEAGUES, 
YOU SAY IS THE SAME OF WHAT 
McCAIN HAD, AGAIN REFERRING TO 
THE DOSSI ER AND THEN THE ONE 
FROM CORN AND SIMPSON. 
IS THAT AN ACCURATE READING OF 
YOUR E-MAIL? 
>>  IT ISN'T AND I THINK TO 
GIVE YOU THE CONTENT OR THE 
CONTEXT.  
IT INCLUDES DETAILS I MAY NOT 
PROVIDE. 
>>  THERE IS ANOTHER E-MAIL 
DOWN BELOW. 
ON THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING AT.  
. 
>>  BUZZ FEED HAS16 OF THE 
REPORTS. 
>>  UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT 
MEANS, IT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO 
PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT IS 
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT I HAVE 
BEEN PERMITTED TO TELL YOU. 
>  WE WOULD SURE LIKE TO KNOW. 
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS 
IN FRONT OF YOU. 
THIS IS THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE'S REPORT. 
THERE'S A FOOTNOTE ON PAGE 113. 
IT SAYS IN LATE MARCH 2017 
DANIEL JONES MET WITH THE FBI 
REGARDING PGW, THE PEN QUARTER 
GROUP THAT HE DESCRIBED AS 
HAVING FOREIGN INFLUENCE IN 
WESTERN ELECTIONS. 
HE SAID IT WAS BEING FUNDED BY 
SEVEN TO TEN WAL-MARTY OWNERS 
WHO PROVIDED $50 MILLION. 
HE FURTHER STATED THAT 42 HAD 
SECURED THE SERVICE OF STEEL, 
HIS ASSOCIATE AND FUSION GPS TO 
CONTINUE EXPOSING POTENTIAL 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 
ELECTION. 
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
MEETING MR. JONES HAD WITH THE 
FBI? 
>>  I'M NOT AND I DON'T KNOW IF 
THAT'S ACCURATE OR NOT. 
I'M NOT AWARE. 
>>  I'M GOING FROM THE 
INTELLIGENCE REPORT THAT THE 
MAJORITY ISSUED FROM THE HOUSE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. 
>>  I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT 
MEETING OR WHO THAT IS MANY. 
>>  HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO DANIEL 
JONES? 
>>  NO. 
>>  DO YOU KNOW HIM? 
>>  I DO NOT. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
I WANT TO GO BACK TO -- ONE 
MORE QUESTION TO ASK YOU THE 
FIRST ROUND MR. STRZOK. 
MR. SIMPSON WHEN HE DID TESTIFY 
IN FRONT OF THE SENATE 
COMMITTEE WAS ASKED ABOUT 
FUSION. 
NOBODY FROM FUSION EVER SPOKE 
WITH THE FBI. 
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT GOES 
AGAINST WHAT IS IN THE E-MAIL 
THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
WITH YOU? 
>>  I DON'T KNOW. 
I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE NOT 
SPOKEN TO MR. SIMPSON. 
>>  NOT SPOKEN TO HIM. 
I DIDN'T ASK YOU THAT. 
I ASKED YOU THAT THE FIRST 
TIME. 
I THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND I 
THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM SOUTH 
CAROLINA FOR YIELDING. 
I YIELD BACK. 
>>  THE CHAIR WOULD NOTE THAT 
SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED 
BY THE GENTLEMAN WEREN'T 
ANSWERED BY THE WITNESS ON THE 
ADVICE OF HIS COUNSEL AND I 
PRESUME THROUGH THE FBI. 
WE WILL NOTE THOSE QUESTIONS SO 
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THEM AT A 
FUTURE TIME BECAUSE I FIND IT 
STUNNING THAT THEY ARE NOT 
ALLOWING YOU TO ANSWER THEM. 
CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMA FROM ILLINOIS. 
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THE CHAIRMAN STARTED THIS 
HEARING BY SAYING I WISH THIS 
HEARING WASN'T NECESSARY. 
WELL, SORRY IF I DON'T BELIEVE 
THAT. 
OF COURSE HE WANTS THIS HEARING 
IT'S NOT NECESSARY. 
I THINK THERE ARE HEARING THAT 
AREN'T NECESSARY. 
WE SEE THEM EVERY DAY. 
THERE ARE 3,000 CHILDREN 
SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOMS AND 
DADS AND THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T 
KNOW WHERE THEIR MOMS AND DADS 
ARE AND CAN'T BRING THEM 
TOGETHER. 
THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THE 
COMMITTEE SHOULD BE 
INVESTIGATING. 
WE START A POLICY IN THIS 
COUNTRY WHERE WE BAN, BAN 
MUSLIMS FROM COMING IN AND WE 
MAKE A TEST, A RELIGIOUS TEST. 
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THE 
COMMITTEE SHOULD TAKE UP. 
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES THAT THERE ARE 16 
WOMEN WHO HAVE COME FORWARD TO 
SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES HAS ATTACKED THEM 
AND WHAT DOES THE COMMITTEE DO? 
NO HEARINGS. 
EVEN ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE HAD TO RESIGN BECAUSE 
HE ASKED ONE OF HIS STAFFERS 
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS IF SHE 
WOULD CARRY A BABY FOR HIM. 
DO WE HAVE ANY HEARINGS ON THE 
STATE AND THE PLIGHT OF WOMEN 
IN THE WORKPLACE IN AMERICA? 
NO. 
THESE ARE ALL THINGS AND ISSUES 
THAT ARE ON THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE'S MINDS. 
WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
THOSE ISSUES. 
THOSE SHOULD BE ISSUES THAT I 
BELIEVE ARE PERTINENT AND 
SHOULD HAVE HEARINGS BEFORE 
THIS COMMITTEE. 
WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HEARING IS 
TO BRING MR. STRZOK SO THAT WE 
CAN REPEAT AND CONTINUE TO SAY 
THAT HE IS LYING AND THAT HE IS 
BIASED AND SOMEONE HE CORRUPTED 
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
POINT THAT WE CAN'T BELIEVE 
CAN'T BELIEVE THE NEW FBI 
DIRECTOR OR ANYONE. 
AND THAT W SHOULDA SHOULD 
ABANDON. 
IF THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE THAT 
ARE THRILLED AND EXCITED TODAY. 
THE FOLKS AT FOX NEWS AND THE 
KREMLIN BECAUSE THEY BOTH 
WORKED ON ELECTING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA. 
THEY HAVE GOT TO BE OVERJOYED 
TODAY AT THE KREMLIN AND 
APPLAUDING AND WATCH THE NEWS 
REEL TONIGHT BECAUSE A LOT OF 
THIS TODAY IS WHAT? 
TRYING OUT FOR FOX NEWS AND OF 
COURSE AT THE CLAPPING AT THE 
KREMLIN. 
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE A 
TIME THAT THE CONGRESS OF THE 
UNITED STATES WOULD DO THE WORK 
OF DESTROYING BECAUSE WHAT DO 
WE KNOW? 
WE KNOW VERY CLEARLY THAT OUR 
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAVE 
STATED AND THIS IS UNREFUTABLE 
THAT THE RUSSIANS WORKED TO 
UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY AND TO 
ELECT DONALD TRUMP. 
YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT 
MR. STRZOK. 
WE DO NOT INVESTIGATE THAT. 
HOW CAN WE HAVE SUCH AN ATTACK 
ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE DON'T 
INVESTIGATE? 
I WANT TO ASK YOU MR. STRZOK. 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE KEPT SAYING 
HAVE YOU THIS BIAS. 
WHEN DID YOU LEARN AND HOW DID 
YOU LEARN ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBLE 
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE DONALD 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN 
INFLUENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION? 
>>  SIR, I'M LIMITED TO WHAT 
DIRECTOR COMEY ISSUABLE TO SAY 
BUT IN LATE JULY. 
>>  WHEN DID THE PUBLIC LEARN 
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO 
RUSSIAN COLLUSION AND DONALD 
TRUMP'S INVESTIGATION? 
>>  I DON'T REMEMBER SPECIFIC 
DATE BUT IT WAS INTO THE 
FOLLOWING YEAR. 
>>  IT WAS AFTER THE ELECTION. 
>>  YES. 
>>  WHAT WE ARE TO BELIEVE FROM 
OUR REPUBLICAN MAJORITY THAT 
YOU ARE SO BIASED, YOU ARE SUCH 
A DEMOCRAT THAT YOU CAN'T HOLD 
BACK FROM TRYING TO DESTROY 
TRUMP BUT YOU NEVER TOLD ANYONE 
THAT THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN 
AND WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS 
SNOW NEVER TOLD ANYONE? 
>>  NO. 
>>  YOU NEVER TALKED TO A 
REPORTER? 
>>  NEVER. 
>>  BUT YOU HAD IT IN YOUR 
HANDS. 
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE IN 
AMERICA IT'S YOU CAN DO ALMOST 
ANYTHING. 
YOU DID HAVE ALMOST A MAGICAL 
BULLET IN YOUR HANDS TO DERAIL 
THE DONALD TRUMP INVESTIGATION 
AND DID YOU USE IT? 
>>  NO SIR. 
>>  YOU DIDN'T. 
RIGHT? 
ARE THERE REPUBLICANS AT WORK 
AT THE FBI? 
IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE ARE YOU 
ALL DEMOCRATS. 
I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE. 
ARE THERE REPUBLICANS IN. 
>>  YES. 
>>  SINCE YOU LIKE TO CHERRY 
PICK THE DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE 
GIVEN MONEY, THE FBI AGENTS 
THAT GIVE MONEY WHY NOT REVEAL 
THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE 
FBI THAT GIVE MONEY TO 
REPUBLICANS IN WHY NOT REVEAL 
THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE 
FBI THAT ARE IN AND STATE VERY 
CLEARLY WHEN THEY APPLY FOR A 
VOTER REGISTRATION THEY APPLY 
AS REPUBLICANS. 
THEY DON'T. 
BECAUSE THAT'S 23409 WHAT THIS 
IS ABOUT. 
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS FOR THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC MR. STRZOK, 
REALLY NOT ABOUT YOU. 
THEY WANT TO DAMAGE AND DESTROY 
OUR DEMOCR ACY AND ONE WAY IS 
BY DESTROYING THE FBI AND 
THAT'S  REGRETTABLE. 
THE KREMLIN WON THE ELECTION 
AND NOW THEY WANT TO DESTROY 
THE INSTITUTIONS. 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
AND CONGRATULATIONS TO 
EVERYBODY THAT IS HELPING THEM. 
>>  GENTLEMAN FROM ILLINOIS 
YIELDS BACK. 
THE GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF 
QUESTIONS FOR YOU MR. STRZOK 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD THE 
BALANCE OF MY TIME TO THE 
CHAIRMAN. 
IN LIGHT OF THE LAST ROUND OF 
QUESTIONING, IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
THAT YOU WANTED TO STOP 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM  BEING 
ELECTED? 
>>  NO. 
THAT WAS THAT I HAD A 
PREFERENCE FOR HIM TO NOT BE 
PRESIDENT BUT I DIDN'T AND 
WOULDN'T. 
>>  DID I NOT HEAR YOU READ 
YOUR OWN TEXTS THAT YOU WOULD 
STOP HIM? 
YOU WOULD STOP IT? 
>>  NO. 
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD OR MISHEARD 
ME. 
I SAID THAT MY SENSE OF NOT 
RECALLING WRITING THAT TEXT WAS 
THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
WOULDN'TELECT HIM. 
>>  YOU DIDN'T LIKE DONALD 
TRUMP? 
ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD 
HAVE LED THIS INVESTIGATION? 
>>  IT WAS LOGICAL GIVEN I WAS 
THE NUMBER TWO IN COUNTER 
INTELLIGENCE BUT NO, THERE ARE 
QUALIFIED FOLKS IN THE FBI. 
DADA, NOT THAT MANY. 
>>  LOOKING BACK THEN SHOULD 
YOU HAVE RECUSED YOURSELF IN? 
>>  ABSOLUTELY NOT. 
>>  YOU DON'T LIKE THIS MAN. 
YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE 
PRESIDENT. 
YOU HAD SEVERAL VERYD ISP  BAD 
TEXTS. 
>>  THERE WERE TIMES I DIDN'T 
CARE FOR CLINTON AND I 
INVESTIGATED THAT. 
>>  THAT'S THE ONE THING I HAVE 
STRUGGLED WITH HERE TODAY 
LISTENING TO YOUR TESTIMONY. 
I THINK A MAN IN YOUR POSITION 
AND POWER AND THE RESPECT THAT 
YOU SHOULD HAVE -- THAT YOU 
WOULD HAVE STOPPED TO THINK 
MAYBE THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT 
COULD DO A BETTER JOB WITHOUT 
SUCH DISDAIN FOR THE PRESIDENT. 
YOU CLAIM TO BE SUCH A PATRIOT 
BUT YOU CONTINUED TO DO IT 
AFTER HE WAS ELECTED. 
>>  AGENT STRZOK I'M CONFUSED. 
I THOUGHT ON THAT AUGUST 8TH 
TEXT YOU THAT DIDN'T RECALL 
TYPING IT. 
THEN YOU SAID THAT YOU RECALLED 
IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT AND THAT 
MITIGATED THE CONTENT OF WHAT 
YOU TYPED. 
DO YOU RECALL IT OR WAS IT LATE 
AT NIGHT AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU 
RECALL ABOUT THE TIMING OF 
THAT? 
>>  I THINK BY RECOLLECTION OF 
STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT 
ACROSS THE BOARD. 
I DON'T REMEMBER TYPING IT. 
IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT. 
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT ITS WAS 
NOT. 
IT WASN'T A SUGGESTION THAT I 
OR THE FBI TAKE ANY ACTION. 
>>  INSTEAD OF US MUSEUMIG 
ABOUT WHAT YOU MEANT, LET'S GO 
WITH WHAT YOU SAID. 
>>  I WOULD RATHER YOU GO WITH 
WHAT I DID. 
THAT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY 
THAT IS. 
>>  WE WILL GET TO THAT IN A 
SECOND. 
I PROMISE YOU. 
NO HE IS NOT. 
WE WILL STOP IT. 
I THINK YOU HAVE AGREED THAT IT 
WAS HIS ELECTION? 
>>  I DIDN'T THINK, NOT 
RECALLING WRITING IT. 
HIS ELECTION, CANDIDACY. 
I DON'T RECALL WRITING IT. 
I. NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANT. 
>>  WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY STOP? 
>>  STOP IT. 
MY SENSE, LOOKING AT THE 
CONTEXT WAS THAT THERE WAS NO 
WAY COMING OFF THE HEELS OF 
INSULTING THE FAMILY THAT THE 
AMERICAN AND ALL THE OTHER 
STATEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE 
IN THE COMPARISON OF SIZE 
DURING A DEBATE AND -- THAT 
THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THE 
AMERICAN POPULATION WAS GOING 
TO ELECT THIS MAN. 
MY SENSE WAS THIS IS A OFF THE 
CUFF, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT SORT 
OF COMMENT. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT DAY 
WHEN I SENT A TEXT SAYING WHAT 
WAS THAT? 
ITS CLEAR THERE IS NO 
CONSPIRACY, THERE IS NO MEETING 
OF THE MINDS, NO SUGGESTION OF 
ACTIONS, IT WAS MERELY A ONE 
OFF COMMENT. 
>>  AND OF COURSE IT'S ABOUT A 
WEEK BEFORE YOU USE THE WORD WE 
AGAIN IN CONNECTION WITH AN 
INSURANCE POLICY TO MAKE SURE 
HE WAS NOT ELECTED PRESIDENT 
AND THEN WE GET TO THE DAY THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS APPOINTED. 
WHO GIVES A F, ONE MORE AD. 
INVESTIGATION LEADING TO 
IMPEACHMENT WITH A QUESTION  
MARK WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
THAT THE DAY OF HIS APPOINT 
NEXT. 
YOU COULD HAVE SAID AN 
INVESTIGATION LEADING TO 
INDICTMENTS AGAINST RUSSIANS, 
AN INVESTIGATION LEADING TO 
BETTER ELECTION SECURITY, AN 
INVESTIGATION LEADING INTO A 
ROBUST RESPONSE TO WHAT RUSSIA 
TRIED TO DO TO OUR COUNTRY BUT 
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT. 
YOU WENT STRAIGHT TO 
IMPEACHMENT. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS? 
>>  I HAVE A GENERAL 
UNDERSTANDING. 
>>  HOW? 
>>  SIR, MY UNDERSTANDING IS 
LIMITED TO THAT ITS SOMETHING 
DONE BY THE CONGRESS. 
THAT THERE ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. 
>>  DO YOU HAVE TO BE A SITTING 
OFFICE HOLDER TO BE IMPEACHED? 
>>  I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. 
>>  I ACTUALLY DO AND I WILL 
TAKE NOTE YOU THAT NEVER USE 
THE WORD IN CONNECTION WITH 
SECRETARY CLINTON DID YOU? 
>>  SIR I -- I DID NOT. 
NO. 
>>  YOU DIDN'T. 
IF YOU DID WE DON'T HAVE IT. 
THAT IS AN INVESTIGATION WHERE 
YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT 
MENTIONING IT BUT THE DAY THE 
AD WAS APPOINTED, RATHER THAN 
PUNISHING RUSSIA OR INDICTING 
RUSSIANS OR DOING SOMETHING 
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU WENT 
STRAIGHT TO IMPEACHMENT. 
>>  WRONG. 
THAT'S NOT CORRECT SIR. 
>>  I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. 
>>  THE TIME. 
>>  I'M OUT OF TIME AND WE  
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
LOUISIANA. 
>>> IS THE WITNESS NOT 
PERMITTED TO ANSWER THE 
QUESTION? 
>> I'M GOING TO OBJECT TO YOU 
NOT PERMITTING THE WITNESS TO 
ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU 
ASKED HIM. 
>>> I WILL FIND OUT WHO IS 
NEXT. 
THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION. 
>> SIR, YOU ASKED IF I WENT 
DIRECTLY TO IMPEACHMENT RATHER 
THAN RUSSIA. 
I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE 
QUESTION. 
-- AS LONG AS YOU RESPOND TO 
THE QUESTION. 
MY IMMEDIATE CONCERN WAS HAVING 
ABSOLUTELY TO DO WITH RUSSIA 
AND EVERYTHING RELATED TO THAT. 
MY CONCERN WAS WHAT RUSSIA WAS 
DOING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHAT 
THE OFFICERS WERE DOING IN THE 
UNITED STATES AND WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA MIGHT OR 
MIGHT NOT BE DOING WITH MEMBERS 
OF THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 
THAT WAS MY RESPONSE. 
>> THAT IS WONDERFUL. 
TRUST ME THAT IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN A LONGER TEXT. 
I GET THAT. 
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LOT 
LONGER FOR YOU TO TYPE THAT. 
YOU DID NOT. 
>>> REGULAR ORDER. 
>> ARE YOU GOING TO PONTIFICATE 
NONSTOP? 
>> RECOGNIZED. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MR. STRZOK, DURING YOUR 11 HOUR 
CLOSED-DOOR INTERVIEW WITH OUR 
COMMITTEE, REPUBLICANS ASKED 
úY 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S AND THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION OF THE DONALD 
TRUMP, RUSSIA COLLUSION AND 
INTERFERENCE WITH THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
AT ONE POINT, YOU DESCRIBED HOW 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S 
INVESTIGATION HAD AND I QUOTE, 
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA HAD 
OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO ELEMENTS 
AND MATTERS OF THE TRUMP TEAM 
ON THE ELECTION. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> I BELIEVE SO. 
I DO NOT HAVE A COPY OF THE 
TRANSCRIPT. 
>>> AND SUBSEQUENTLY, HE 
FOLLOWED UP WITH THE QUESTION, 
STATING, AND I QUOTE, THERE WAS 
EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA WAS TRYING 
TO DO IT. 
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THE OTHER 
WAY AROUND. 
DO YOU RECALL THAT? 
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT 
SPECIFIC EXCHANGE, MA'AM. 
>> YOU TOLD AND I'M GOING FROM 
THE TRANSCRIPT -- YOU TOLD 
RHETT MEDALS THAT YOU 
UNDERSTOOD HIS QUESTION BUT YOU 
COULD NOT ANSWER IN AN  
UNCLASSIFIED SETTING. 
IT APPEARS FROM YOUR 
TRANSCRIPT, SIR, THAT YOU 
INTERPRETED HIS QUESTION AS 
QUOTE, WHETHER OR NOT THERE 
WERE ANY RECIPROCATION OF THAT 
BY MEMBERS  OF THE DONALD TRUMP 
TEAM IN OFFERING THEIR 
ASSISTANCE BACK TO RUSSIA. 
YOU LATER CONTINUE TO EXPLAIN 
AND I'M QUOTING FROM YOUR 
TRANSCRIPT, AS WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE WAS INFORMATION ABOUT 
WHETHER ELEMENTS OF THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN WERE  THEMSELVES 
ENGAGING IN THAT I CAN'T ANSWER 
THAT IN AN UNCLASSIFIED SETTING 
AND FURTHERMORE I DON'T THINK 
THE FBI OR SPECIAL COUNSEL 
WOULD WANT ME COMMENTING ON 
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. 
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE 
QUESTION OF WHETHER THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN WAS TRYING TO COLLUDE 
WITH RUSSIA  CALLS FOR A 
CLASSIFIED RESPONSE AND THE 
RESPONSE THAT WOULD INVOLVE 
INFORMATION THAT'S PART OF AN 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>> YES. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT YOU 
TO REVEAL ANY CLASSIFIED OR 
SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIVE 
INFORMATION IN THIS SETTING. 
WE HAVE REPEATEDLY GONE BACK 
AND FORTH WITH THAT, AND I 
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE TO 
REPEAT THINGS REPEATEDLY TO 
SUCH AN INTELLIGENT GROUP OF 
PEOPLE. 
BACK IN MARCH, CHAIRMAN GOWDY 
STATED ON NATIONAL TV AND I 
QUOTE, AND IF YOU BELIEVE AS WE 
HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE TO COLLUSION, YOU 
SHOULD WANT SPECIAL COUNSEL 
MUELLER TO TAKE ALL THE TIME 
AND HAVE ALL THE INDEPENDENCE 
HE NEEDS TO DO HIS JOB. 
CHAIRMAN GOWDY ALSO STATED AND 
I QUOTE, WHEN YOU'RE INNOCENT 
AND THE ALLEGATIONS OF 
COLLISIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS, 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. 
YOU ARE NOT INNOCENT OF THAT. 
ACT LIKE IT. 
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
ALLIES WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT 
THERE IS NO COLLUSION WITH 
RUSSIA, AND THAT IS WHAT THIS 
IS ABOUT, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT 
THEY TAKE CHAIRMAN GOWDY'S 
RECOMMENDATION AND BEGIN ACTING 
LIKE IT. 
AND I YIELD BACK MY TIME. 
>> SHE YIELDS BACK. 
AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
IN YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY 
TODAY, YOU STATED THAT QUOTE, 
NOT ONCE DID MY PERSONAL BIAS 
INTERFERE WITH MY JUDGMENT. 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF BIAS IN 
MY PROFESSIONAL ACTION CLOSE 
QUOTE. 
LET'S EXPLORE THAT STATEMENT 
FOR A SECOND CAN YOU PLEASE 
DIVINE BECAUSE I AM -- DEFINE, 
BECAUSE I AM REALLY CONFUSED, 
WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF 
BIAS? 
MAKE IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT 
OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
IN REGARD TO POLITICAL OPINION. 
THAT IS ALLOWING YOUR BELIEFS 
TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE HONEST 
INDEPENDENT PURSUIT OF FACTS. 
>> ALLOWING YOUR OWN BELIEFS TO 
GET IN THE WAY OF YOUR ACTIONS. 
>> RIGHT. 
OF YOUR HONEST -- 
>> PLEASE GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF 
A SITUATION WHEN BUYERS WOULD 
INTERFERE WITH YOUR ASPECT, 
YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. 
>> IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER 
HYPOTHETICAL. 
I AM NOT GOING TO INTERVIEW A 
WITNESS. 
I'M GOING TO DESTROY EVIDENCE. 
I'M GOING TO PREVENT SOMEBODY 
FROM TAKING INVESTIGATIVE STEP. 
I AM NOT -- IT IS DIFFICULT. 
>> HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME 
WHEN YOUR PROFESSIONAL ACTIONS 
OR YOU BELIEVED THAT YOU HAD 
BIAS? 
THAT YOU NEEDED TO MOVE ON FROM 
AN INVESTIGATION AT ANY TIME? 
>> NO. 
>> NO. 
HAS THERE BEEN A TIME IN YOUR 
CAREER THAT YOU HAVE RECUSED 
YOURSELF FROM A PROFESSIONAL 
ACTION? 
>> NO. 
>> OKAY. 
YOU WILL BE SURPRISED WHAT I 
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE 
RUSSIANS TRIED TO DESTABILIZE 
OUR ECONOMY. 
OUR WAY OF LIFE, OUR 
GOVERNMENT. 
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME. 
I AM CURIOUS IF THIS IS THE 
FIRST TIME THAT RUSSIA TRIED TO 
INTERFERE WITH AN AMERICAN 
ELECTION. 
>> I AM AWARE OF TIMES WHERE 
THEY -- GOING BACK TO THE 1960S 
AND THE 1970S, WHERE THEY 
PLANTED EVIDENCE. 
THEY WERE SEEKING TO INTRODUCE 
ITEMS OF INFORMATION THAT WERE 
FALSE IN NEWSPAPERS. 
I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DIRECT 
OUTREACH TO MEMBERS OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL, EITHER CANDIDATE 
OR HIS IMMEDIATE TEAM. 
>> DID THEY ATTEMPT TO 
INTERFERE IN THE 2012 
ELECTIONS? 
>> I AM CERTAIN THAT THEY DID. 
YES. 
>> DO YOU REMEMBER PRESIDENT 
OBAMA TELLING THE RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT THAT HE WOULD HAVE 
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO NEGOTIATE 
ON THE ISSUES LIKE ADMISSION 
THE DEFENSE AFTER THE 2012 
ELECTION? 
NO I DO NOT REMEMBER. 
>> HE SAID THAT IN A HOT 
MICROPHONE. 
WHY WAS THAT NOT INVESTIGATED? 
>> SIR, BECAUSE THERE WERE NO 
ALLEGATIONS TO MY KNOWLEDGE. 
AGAIN, I WAS NOT IN THE 
POSITION. 
>>> THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES TELLING THE 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT THAT HE WOULD 
HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND HE 
WOULD DO CERTAIN THINGS -- DO 
YOU RECALL DURING THE DEBATES 
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA OBJECTED 
IT TO CANDIDATE ROMNEY THAT THE 
1980S ARE NOW CALLING TO ASK 
FOR THEIR FOREIGN-POLICY BOOK, 
THE COLD WAR IS OVER. 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? 
>> I DO NOT. 
>> SO YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE WITH THE 
ELECTIONS IN 2012, BUT YOU ARE 
INTERESTED IN RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN 2016. 
YOU WERE NOT INTERESTED IN AND 
THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT 
THAT WAS SAYING THAT RUSSIA WAS 
NO LONGER FOREIGN POWER THAT WE 
NEEDED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. 
>> SIR, I DISAGREE WITH THAT 
STATEMENT. 
>> YOU DO NOT EVEN RECALL THOSE 
STATEMENTS SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW 
YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH THEM. 
BACK YOU ARE CHARACTERIZING MY 
INTEREST INTERFERE THAT I CAN 
RESPOND TO THAT IF YOU LIKE. 
>> HOW CAN YOU ASSURE THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE 
NOT LYING TODAY? 
>> ONE, AS I SAID BEFORE, I AM 
DOING IT UNDER OATH. 
I'M TELLING YOU HAVING SPENT 26 
YEARS, PUTTING ON A GUN AND 
PUTTING MY LIFE AT RISK FOR 
THIS COUNTRY, I AM NOT LYING TO 
YOU. 
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE MY 
WORD FOR IT. 
I GET PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE 
HESITANT. 
I WOULD SAY, LOOK AT THE 
RECORD. 
LOOK AT EVERYBODY WHO HAS 
WORKED WITH ME. 
AT WHAT THEY SAID. 
ABSOLUTELY. 
>> TODAY YOU STATED YOU DID NOT 
MEAN IT WHEN YOU SAID THAT 
DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER SMILED 
AND YOU DID NOT MEAN IT WHEN 
YOU SAID THAT YOU USE THE WORD 
IMPEACHMENT AND WHEN YOU SAID 
REPUBLICANS WERE HILLBILLIES. 
YOU WERE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. 
IN THOSE MOMENTS. 
>> I DISAGREE WITH THAT. 
I SAID I DID NOT MEAN IT WHEN I 
TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU 
COULD SMELL THE SUPPORTER 
HILLBILLIES. 
THAT WAS A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS 
THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT I DID 
NOT SAY I DID NOT BELIEVE IN 
PEACE. 
MY EXPLANATION WAS DIFFERENT. 
THAT WAS, AS I CONSIDERED IT, 
THAT WAS ON THE FAR END OF WHAT 
MIGHT BE OCCURRING. 
WHAT I SAID WAS THE OPPOSITE. 
>> I UNDERSTAND FINALLY, THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE ASSERTIONS 
THAT ARE NOT TRUE. 
FIRST THAT THE IG FOUND NO BIAS 
IN YOUR ACTIONS. 
THIS IS NOT TRUE. 
THE A.G. 
SAID, QUOTE, WE WERE DEEPLY 
TROUBLED BY TEXT MESSAGES SENT 
BY PETER STRZOK AND PAGE THAT 
INDICATED OR CREATED THE 
APPEARANCE THAT INVESTIGATIVE 
DECISIONS WERE IMPACTED BY BIAS 
OR IMPROPER CONSIDERATION. 
SMACKING RIGHT AND YOU READ 
WHAT YOU JUST SAID, POTENTIALLY 
CREATE THE APPEARANCE. 
THAT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT AN ACT 
OF BIAS. 
IT IS A HEDGE 23 ADJECTIVE 
DESCRIPTION ABOUT SOMETHING 
WHICH I CAN TELL YOU DOES NOT 
EXIST. 
>> MOREOVER AS WE DESCRIBE IN 
ASSESSING PETER STRZOK'S 
DECISION TO PRIORITIZE THE 
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION OVER 
FOLLOWING UP ON THE MEDIA 
RELATED INVESTIGATIVE LEAD, 
DISCOVERING THE LAPTOP IN 
OCTOBER 2016, THESE TEXT 
MESSAGES LEAD US TO CONCLUDE 
THAT WE DID NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE 
THAT PETER STRZOK'S DECISIONS 
WERE FREE FROM BIAS. 
>> YES. 
>> SO THERE WAS NO DECISION 
THAT THERE WAS NO BIAS. 
THEY JUST CANNOT FIND WHETHER 
THERE WAS BIAS OR NOT AND 
MOREOVER, THEY DID NOT REALLY 
-- 
>> AND MR. CHAIRMAN, REGULAR 
ORDER. 
>> THEY DID NOT INVESTIGATE  
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION SO 
THERE IS PENDING. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN IS OUT OF TIME 
AND YIELDS BACK. 
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. 
I DID NOT HEAR A QUESTION. 
>> I DO NOT AGREE BUT HE WAS 
ASKING ME WHETHER I BELIEVE 
THAT THE IG REPORT INDICATED 
THAT THERE WAS AN ACT OF BIAS.  
LIKE THEY ARE FREE TO HEAR YOUR 
ANSWER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK 
THAT THE WITNESS HE PERMITTED 
TO ANSWER A QUESTION. 
>> MAY I RESPOND? 
SIR, LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS OF 
THE LAPTOP THEY ARE WITHIN 
HOURS, LITERALLY LESS THAN FOUR 
HOURS OF LEARNING, I SIGNED 
AGENT TO GO AND CHECK IN AND 
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS -- 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT WAS NOT 
THE QUESTION. 
>> WITHIN A DAY THEY HAD DONE 
SO AND THOSE WERE THE FOLKS ON 
RELATED --'S MAKE THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM IDAHO HAS YIELDED BACK AND 
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A SHORT 
RESPONSE TO A QUESTION THAT HE 
DOES NOT BELIEVE HE ASKED, YOU 
ARE WELCOME TO DO IT BUT KEEP 
IT SHORT. 
>> SPEAK CLEARLY INTO THE 
MICROPHONE AND RAISE THE 
MICROPHONE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY BUT I WOULD TAKE 
ISSUE AND I DO TAKE ISSUE WITH 
THE IG CONCLUSION THAT SAID 
SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD NOT 
EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT 
PLAYED A ROLE IN WHAT I WOULD 
POINT YOU AND THEM TO ARE THE 
FACTS THAT ARE WITHIN HOURS OF 
LEARNING, HOURS, OF LEARNING OF 
THE WEINER LAPTOP, I ASSIGNED A 
SEASONED SUPERVISORY AGENTS AND 
SUBORDINATE AGENTS TO FOLLOW UP 
ON THAT AND WITHIN A DAY OF 
GETTING THAT INFORMATION, THEY 
HAD GOTTEN IN TOUCH WITH NEW 
YORK AND DETERMINED THAT NEW 
YORK HAD NOT COMPLETED THE 
PROCESSING AND THAT THEY WERE 
GOING TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH 
THAT OCCURRED. 
THE NOTION THAT ANYTHING WAS 
BACK BYRD IS BELIED BY THE 
FACTS THAT LITERALLY WITHIN 24 
HOURS OF LEARNING OF THAT 
INFORMATION, I HAD ASSIGNED 
PEOPLE WHO, BY THE WAY, HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATION, TO FOLLOW UP ON 
THE MATTER. 
>> YOU HAVE ANSWERED THE 
QUESTION. 
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. 
>> MR. STRZOK, THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBLE 
COLLUSION IN THE 2016 ELECTION 
HAS RESULTED IN 23 INDICTMENTS, 
CORRECT? 
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE NUMBER. 
SNAKE IT HAS RESULTED IN 18 
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN 
INDICTED. 
TRUE? 
BUT I DO NOT KNOW THE NUMBERS. 
>> THREE CORPORATE ENTITIES 
HAVE BEEN INDICTED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE DONALD 
TRUMP RUSSIAN COLLUSION 
INVESTIGATION. 
CORRECT? 
BUT I WILL ACCEPT YOUR 
REPRESENTATION. 
>> THE INVESTIGATION HAS 
IDENTIFIED 75 DIFFERENT 
CRIMINAL ACTS. 
CORRECT? 
BUT AGAIN, I HAVE NOT TALLIED 
THEM UP. 
>> THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE GUILTY 
PLEAS. 
TRUE? 
>> I BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT 
BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN. 
>> PAUL MANFORD HAS BEEN 
CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO 
DEPRIVE THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 
CORRECT? 
>> HE HAS BEEN CHARGED BUT I DO 
NOT KNOW THE CRIMES. 
>> HE IS SITTING IN JAILS AS A 
RESULT OF WITNESS TAMPERING. 
TRUMPS FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISOR HAS PLED GUILTY TO 
LYING TO THE FBI. 
>> YES. 
>> THE DEPUTY MANAGER HAS BEEN 
INDICTED FOR CONSPIRACY TO FRY 
THE UNITED STATES. 
>> HE HAS BEEN INDICTED I DO 
NOT KNOW THE CHARGES. 
>> GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, A 
FORMER SECURITY NATIONAL 
ADVISOR HAS PLED GUILTY TO 
LYING TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS 
ABOUT HIS CONTACTS WITH RUSSIAN 
SPIES DURING THE CAMPAIGN. 
TRUE? 
>> CERTAINLY WITH RUSSIANS I DO 
NOT KNOW HOW TO CHARACTERIZE. 
>> THE FBI PUBLICLY DISCLOSED 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE HILLARY 
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION, 11 
DAYS PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, IN 
2016. 
TRUE? 
>> YES. 
>> THE FBI MAINTAINED 
CONFIDENTIAL ABOUT THE DONALD 
TRUMP RUSSIAN CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION DURING THE ENTIRE 
DURATION OF THE DONALD TRUMP 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. 
CORRECT? 
>> YES 
>> IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO STOP 
DONALD TRUMP FROM BECOMING 
PRESIDENT, YOU COULD HAVE 
REVEALED THE CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE DONALD 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. 
TRUE? 
>> YES, SIR. 
>> MR. STRZOK, YOU ARE BEFORE 
THIS COMMITTEE FOR ONE REASON. 
TO SERVE AS A MONUMENTAL 
DISTRACTION. THERE IS A 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. 
INTO THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
AND POSSIBLE CRIMES RELATED TO 
THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, 
INVOLVING COLLUSION WITH 
RUSSIAN SPIES TO SELL OUT OUR 
DEMOCRACY AND HIJACK THE 
PRESIDENCY. 
MY COLLEAGUES IN THE COVER-UP 
CAUCUS DO NOT LIKE THAT 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. 
THEREFORE, THEY NEED TO 
IDENTIFY A VILLAIN. 
MR. STRZOK, TAG. 
YOU ARE IT. 
HERE IS WHAT IS SO IRONIC ABOUT 
THAT CHARACTERIZATION. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS A THUG AND A 
DICTATOR. 
HE HIJACKED AND INTERFERED AND 
ATTACKED OUR DEMOCRACY. 
BUT APPARENTLY, HE DOES NOT MEET
THE REPUBLICAN VILLAIN TEST. 
OUR SO-CALLED COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF CONTINUES TO PLAY FOOTSIE 
WITH HIM. 
KIM JONG-UN MURDERS HIS PEOPLE 
AND HAS THREATENED NUCLEAR 
ANNIHILATION AGAINST AMERICAN 
CITIES, BUT APPARENTLY, HE DOES 
NOT MEET THE REPUBLICAN VILLAIN 
TEST. THE ADMINISTRATION 
CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN FAKE 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM. 
DAVID DUKE AND NEO-NAZIS 
APPARENTLY FOR SOME DO NOT MEET 
THE REPUBLICAN VILLAIN TEST. 
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. 
I FORGOT. 
THERE ARE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH 
SIDES. 
ROY MOORE, AN ALLEGED SERIAL 
PEDOPHILE, APPARENTLY DOES NOT 
MEET THE REPUBLICAN VILLAIN 
TEST. 
HE WAS THE NOMINEE OF YOUR PARTY
FOR A SEAT IN THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE. 
BUT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE 
THAT AGENT PETER STRZOK, A 
FORMER ARMY OFFICER, WHO HAS 
SERVED THE FBI WITH 
DISTINCTION, YES, MADE SOME 
MISTAKES, IS THE GRAVEST 
EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY. 
HOW DARE YOU LECTURE US ABOUT 
VILLAINS. WHEN YOUR PARTY 
CONTINUES TO TURN A BLIND EYE 
TO THAT PARADE OF DEGENERATES 
THAT I JUST LISTED. 
THIS INVESTIGATION IS A JOKE. 
IT IS A FRAUD. 
THIS HEARING IS A KANGAROO 
COURT. 
IT IS A THREE RING CIRCUS. 
IT IS NOT EVEN MERITORIOUS OF 
AN INVESTIGATION BY ACE VENTURA 
PET DETECTIVE, LET ALONE 75 
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES 
CONGRESS. 
LET'S STOP WASTING TAXPAYER 
DOLLARS, AND GET BACK TO THE 
BUSINESS OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
>> YOU YIELD BACK TO THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH 
CAROLINA IS RECOGNIZED. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD MY TIME 
TO YOU.! 
THANK YOU, THE AGENT -- AGENT 
STRZOK ON MARCH 14, 2017, I 
THINK WE WERE WHAT, A COUPLE OF 
MONTHS INTO THE PRESIDENCY? 
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN RECALL 
THIS TEXT. 
THIS TEXT THAT YOU RECEIVED. 
FINALLY, TWO PAGES AWAY FROM 
FINISHING A TPM. 
DO YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT 
RESIGNS IN THE END? 
WHAT IS A TPM? 
>> I BELIEVE IT IS A REFERENCE 
TO THE BOOK ALL OF THE 
PRESIDENTS MEN. 
>> DO YOU RECALL HOW YOU 
APPLIED? 
>> GENERALLY I WOULD FAINT 
SURPRISE AND SAY SOMETHING TO 
THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE SO 
LUCKY OR FORTUNATE. 
>> NO, IT WAS LUCKY. 
LUCKY IN WHAT WAY? 
>> SIR, THAT HE WOULD RESIGN AS 
PRESIDENT. 
>> YOU WANTED HIM TO RESIGN TWO 
MONTHS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY? 
>> MY SENSE WAS IN A PERSONAL 
BELIEF THAT I WAS NOT PLEASED 
WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THINGS 
ARE BEING DONE WITH THE 
PRESIDENCY. 
>> I THOUGHT THAT YOU TRUSTED 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
I THOUGHT THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID 
IN AUGUST 2016, IF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WOULD STOP HIM AND THEN 
THEY DID NOT STOP HERE. 
HERE WE ARE IN MARCH AND ALL OF 
A SUDDEN. 
TRUSTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
ANYMORE. 
>> I UTTERLY TRUSTED THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT I WORRY 
ABOUT IS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF 
RUSSIA PUTS THEIR FINGERS ON 
THE SCALE AND CAUSES THAT WILL 
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
OTHER THAN AMERICA. 
>> HOW MANY INDICTMENTS HAVE 
THERE BEEN OF AMERICANS FOR 
COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA? 
>> I COULD NOT ANSWER THE 
QUESTION. 
TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN. 
YOU WORKED ON THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> YOU KNOW FULL WELL THAT 
COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME. 
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE TERM 
CAME FROM. 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>> IT IS NOT CONSPIRACY, 
COORDINATION, COLLUSION. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE USE THOSE WORDS 
IN THE SAME WAY. 
HOW ABOUT WE SAY CONSPIRACY? 
HOW MANY AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 
INDICTED FOR CONSPIRING WITH 
RUSSIA TO IMPACT THE 2016 
ELECTION? 
>> NONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE, YET. 
>> WE WILL BE HAPPY TO GET MR. 
NADLER AS A WITNESS AT NEST -- 
NEXT WEEK'S HEARING IF HE WANTS 
TO HELP YOU ANSWER THAT. 
SO YOU WANTED PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TO RESIGN TWO MONTHS INTO HIS 
PRESIDENCY. 
>> NO, SIR. 
I THINK I READ THAT AS A SNARKY 
COMMENT ABOUT A BOOK THAT WAS 
BEING A RED AND A COMMENT THAT 
WAS MADE THAT IT IS A 
CONVERSATIONAL TEXT EXCHANGE 
AND NOT A WRITTEN -- A DESIRE 
FOR SOMETHING TO OCCUR. 
>> MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT HELP 
ME. 
DIED THAT WE SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.
>> YES, SIR. 
I THINK YOU WOULD EXCEPT AS A 
VERY INTELLIGENT AND 
SOPHISTICATED MAN THAT PEOPLE 
FREQUENTLY SPEAK WHEN THEY ARE 
TEXTING AND IN CONVERSATION AND 
YOU WILL SAY THINGS THAT ARE 
HYPERBOLE OR EXAGGERATION OR 
NOT LITERAL BECAUSE THAT IS 
JUST THE NATURE OF THE WAY THAT 
WE SPEAK? 
USUALLY AGENT STRZOK NOT WHEN I 
AM SUPPOSED TO BE VIRTUALLY 
INVESTIGATED SOMEONE. 
I ACTUALLY DID NOT. 
LET'S GO. 
LET'S GO. 
WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE WHO 
GIVES A LETTER OF ONE MORE -- 
VERSUS THE INVESTIGATION THAT 
LEADING TO IMPEACHMENT. 
WE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED 
THAT THERE IS A SCHOOL OF 
THOUGHT THAT YOU CAN BE 
IMPEACHED EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A 
CURRENT OFFICE HOLDER. 
YOU CAN BE BARRED FROM HOLDING 
OFFICE IN THE FUTURE, BUT YOU 
DID NOT ENGAGE IN ANY 
IMPEACHMENT ANALYSIS IN YOUR 
OTHER 2016 INVESTIGATION. 
IT WAS SECRETARY CLINTON. 
YOU SAVED ALL OF THAT FOR THE 
CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP. 
SO I WANTED TO GO TO ANOTHER 
TEXT. 
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE ODDS 
ARE NOTHING. 
IF I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKELY, I 
WOULD BE THERE. 
NO QUESTION. 
NOW THIS IS THE DAY AFTER 
ROBERT MUELLER WAS APPOINTED. 
WHEN YOU SAID BE THERE, ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT ON HIS TEAM? 
>> YES. 
>> I HESITATE IN PART BECAUSE 
OF MICAH SENSE AND CONCERN. 
THERE IS NO BIG THERE THERE. 
SO IN ADDITION TO DISAPPOINTING 
THE HELL OUT OF MY DEMOCRAT 
COLLEAGUES, THAT SOMEONE WHO IS 
INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN COLLUSION 
DID NOT THINK THAT THERE WAS 
ANY THERE THERE, WHY WOULD YOU 
BE CONCERNED? 
WHY WOULD YOU NOT BE ECSTATIC 
THAT THERE WAS NO COLLUSION? 
WHY THE WORD CONCERN? 
>> SIR, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I 
MEANT. 
CONCERN TO ME SEEMS LIKE THERE 
IS A LOT GOING ON AND A LOT 
PRESUMPTIVE THAT THERE MAY BE 
SOMETHING LIKE IMPEACHMENT BUT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO PICK PICK WHICH 
ONE DO YOU WANT? 
I AM EITHER CONVINCED THAT 
THERE IS IMPEACHMENT OR I AM 
CONVINCED WHAT YOU JUST READ, 
THAT THERE IS NO THERE THERE. 
AND THE REALITY, SIR, IF YOU 
LOOK AT IT IS THE FACT, THAT I 
WAS LOOKING AT THIS WITH AN 
OPEN MIND AND SAYING, I DO NOT 
KNOW THIS MAXIMA AGENT STRZOK, 
OF ALL OF THE UNIVERSAL 
OPTIONS, THAT IS NOT THE ONE 
THAT I PICKED OF ALL OF THE 
UNIVERSE OF OPTIONS, YOU 
LOOKING AT SOMETHING WITH AN 
OPEN MIND IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 
I PICKED. 
>> THAT IS THE OBVIOUS WANT TO 
CONCLUDE FROM THE EMAIL. 
>> I WILL TELL YOU THE ONE THAT 
I PICKED. 
THE ONE THAT I PICKED AND IT 
BREAKS MY HEART TO SAY THIS 
ABOUT AN AGENT FOR AN AGENCY 
THAT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT 
FOR. 
YOU AS A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
OFFICER HAD NO INTEREST IN 
PARTICIPATING IN A 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
INVESTIGATION THAT WAS NOT 
GOING TO LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT. 
THAT IS HOW I READ IT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU ARE --'S 
BACK NO QUESTION. 
>>> YOU ARE ASSUMING SOMEONE 
ELSE. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU ARE COMING TO 
CONCLUSION ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S 
VIEWPOINTS IN THE HEARING. 
ALLOW THE WITNESS TO RESPOND. 
>>> I WILL -- I'M SURE THAT MY 
TIME IS NOT RECOGNIZED. 
I HESITATE IN PART BECAUSE OF 
MY GUT SENSE AND CONCERN THAT 
THERE IS NO BIG THERE THERE. 
WHAT WERE YOU CONCERNED WAS NOT 
THERE? 
>> SIR, MY CONCERN WAS NOT 
KNOWING, GIVEN THESE 
ALLEGATIONS, WHAT EXISTED. 
WHETHER ON THE ONE HAND, THERE 
WAS NO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY 
WHATSOEVER TOWARDS THE MIDDLE, 
THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL KIND 
OF PURSUING THEIR OWN AGENDAS 
FOR THEIR OWN SELF ENRICHMENT 
OR ON THE FAR END THAT THERE 
IGHT BE AN IMPEACHABLE 
OFFENSE. 
>> WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO 
INVESTIGATE? 
>> MY ANSWER TO QUESTION -- 
>> MY QUESTION IS WHY WOULD YOU 
NOT WANT TO INVESTIGATE THAT?  
>> I DID WANT TO INVESTIGATE 
THAT. 
THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE 
READING. 
WHAT YOU ARE READING IS MY 
TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT I WANT TO 
DO WITH THE COURSE OF MY CAREER 
AND A WHETHER TO STAY AS A 
DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN A 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIVISION 
WHERE I HAVE OVERSIGHT OF A 
WIDE VARIETY OF THREATS AROUND 
THE GLOBE OR WHETHER I WANT TO 
REMOVE MYSELF AND GO WORK ON 
SOMETHING IN THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL'S OFFICE  THAT IS VERY 
SPECIFIC, THAT IS GOING TO TAKE 
THE -- I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG. 
BUT TO YOUR POINT OF THIS MAKES 
>> YOU ARE LEAVING OUT AN 
IMPORTANT WORD. 
IMPEACHMENT. 
>> REGULAR ORDER. 
IT IS A MINUTE AND A HALF OVER. 
SNACK ON AND ON AND ON. 
>> POINT OF ORDER. 
TIME IS UP. 
LIKE IMPEACHMENT. 
AT FOUR BIG WORDS OF NO BIG 
THERE THERE AND YOU KNOW FULL 
WELL THAT I SAID BOTH AND YOU 
KNOW WHY I SAID BOTH. 
WHY I DID THAT AND WHAT I'M 
TELLING YOU UNDER OATH IS THAT 
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT EXISTED. 
I HAD PREJUDGED NOTHING. 
THAT WAS ALL TO BE DETERMINED. 
AND THAT IS A LOGICAL WAY FOR 
INVESTIGATORS, ATTORNEYS, AND 
STARTING -- WITH THE POLITICAL 
DEATH PENALTY AND IMPEACHMENT 
IS NOT A LOGICAL WAY THAT A 
NEUTRAL, DISPASSIONATE -- 
>> CHAIRMAN, WE ARE DEMANDING 
EQUAL TIME. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> IF YOU CANNOT CONTROL 
YOURSELF, HOW DO YOU EXPECT 
THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTROL 
ITSELF? 
YOU HAVE BEEN OUT OF CONTROL 
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE IT ALONE? 
THIS IS NOT BENGHAZI. 
SELECT THE GENERAL LADY FROM 
NEW JERSEY IS RECOGNIZED. 
>> YOU ARE RECOGNIZE, 
CONGRESSWOMAN. 
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. 
>> HALLELUJAH. 
>>  BACK FIRST OF 
ALL, MR. STRZOK, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. 
SECONDLY MR. STRZOK, I THINK 
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE BY 
PUTTING THOSE TEXT MESSAGES ON 
YOUR BUSINESS TELEPHONE. 
BECAUSE THEN YOU OPENED UP YOUR 
PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND HERE WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS MESS 
WHEN IT REALLY IS NOT IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT I 
KNOW, MR. STRZOK IS THAT EVEN 
IF YOU DO HAVE BIASES, YOU DID 
NOT INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF 
THIS INVESTIGATION. 
THE ATTORNEY -- THE IG FOUND 
THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION WAS PREDICATED 
UPON EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION. 
THE OTHER THING THAT I KNOW IS 
THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU 
DISLIKE HILLARY CLINTON AND OR 
DONALD TRUMP, YOU DID NOT HAVE 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH EITHER ONE 
OF THEM GETTING ELECTED. 
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
DISGRACING THIS COUNTRY EVERY 
SINGLE SOLITARY DAY WHEN HE 
EMBRACES OUR ENEMIES AND SUCKS 
UP -- EMBRACES OUR ENEMIES AND 
IS DISRESPECTFUL TO OUR ALLIES. 
YOU HAVENOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES HAS DECLARED 
HIGHER TERRORISTS IN THE NAME 
OF SECURITY TO THIS NATION 
AGAINST OUR CLOSEST FRIEND AND 
NEIGHBOR, CANADA, BUT NO ONE ON 
THIS SIDE OF THE AISLE HAS 
OPENED THEIR MOUTH. 
YOU HAVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 
THE PRESIDENT AND ENRICHING 
HIMSELF WITH HIS EMOLUMENTS AND 
CARVING OUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
HIS DAUGHTER SO THAT SHE IS NOT 
NEGATIVELY IMPACTEDWITH HER 
BRANDS IN CHINA, WHILE THIS 
SIDE OF THE AISLE SAYS NOTHING. 
YOU HAVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 
THE FACT THAT PUERTO RICO IS 
STILL UNDERWATER AND WITHOUT 
ANY KIND OF ELECTRICITY AND 70 
PLACES, WHY THIS SIDE OF THE 
AISLE THAT IS A PART OF THE 
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, HAS 
FORGOTTEN WHAT IT'S MISSION IS. 
BUT NONETHELESS, YOU HAVE BEEN 
HERE AND YOU HAVE TRIED TO 
ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS AND I 
HAVE NEVER SEEN MY COLLEAGUES 
SO OUT OF CONTROL, SO ANGRY, 
AND SO DESPERATE TO PROTECT A 
PRESIDENT THAT WE ALL KNOW IS 
NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT. 
SO I WANT TO LEAVE YOU THIS 
OPPORTUNITY. 
IS THERE ANY QUESTION ON THE 
TABLE, MR. STRZOK, THAT YOU 
HAVE BEEN ASKED THAT YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO CLARIFY? 
BECAUSE I CAN GIVE YOU TWO 
MINUTES AND 25 SECONDS TO HAVE 
YOUR SAY UNINTERRUPTED. 
MET CONGRESSWOMAN, I DEEPLY 
APPRECIATE THAT TIME. 
I DO WANT THIS EVERYBODY IS 
WATCHING THIS AND MAKING UP 
THEIR OWN MIND, AND WHAT I 
WOULD TELL YOU IS, ONE, I AM 
SITTING HERE TELLING YOU THE 
TRUTH AND TWO, INDEPENDENT OF 
ME, I CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOU MY 
LOVE OF THE FBI ENOUGH. THE MEN 
AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THAT 
WORKFORCE -- THEIR ETHICS, 
THEIR INTEGRITY, ARE UNMATCHED 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT, ONE, 
BECAUSE IT IS WHO WE ARE. 
TWO, THAT NONE OF THEM WOULD 
ACCEPT ANY OF THE BEHAVIORS 
THAT ARE BEING ALLEGED ANY MORE 
THAN I WOULD ACCEPT IT IN HIM 
AND, THREE, THIS ENTIRE 
EXERCISE COMES AT A COST. 
WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT ARE 
GOING TO COME IN THE FUTURE, 
TEAR DOWN THE UNDERPINNINGS OF 
WHAT REPRESENT LAW AND ORDER IN 
THIS COUNTRY. 
AND THERE IS NOT A ROBUST TAKE 
A WALL THERE BUT I THINK THAT 
PEOPLE DO NOT APPRECIATE HOW 
TENUOUS THE BALANCE OF THE RULE 
OF LAW VERSUS CHAOS IS. 
WHEN WE, AS A PEOPLE, ENGAGE IN 
ACTIVITY WHERE WE TAKE 
INSTITUTIONS WHOLESALE, WHETHER 
THE FBI OR THE U.S. 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, AND WE 
COMPARE THEM TO NAZIS, WE 
DESTROY THINGS THAT, ONE, WE 
MAY NOT  SEE FOR YEARS AND 
YEARS AND YEARS AND ONCE WE 
BREAK THOSE DOWN, THE AMOUNT OF 
TIME THAT IT TAKES TO FIX IS 
GOING TO BE TENFOLD AND I 
CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT I ASK 
ALL OF YOU TO TAKE DEEPLY YOUR 
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR 
SYSTEM -- 
>> THANK YOU, MR. STRZOK. 
I NEED TO SAY IN CLOSING, IF 
ANYBODY SHOULD BE PLACED AT THE 
FBI, BECAUSE YOU ALL HELPED THIS
UNFIT MAN BECOME PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES BY NOT 
REVEALING TO THE PEOPLE THAT HE 
WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN HIS 
CAMPAIGN, IT SHOULD BE ME. 
THEY SHOULD BE APPLAUDING YOU, 
KISSING YOU, AND GIVING YOU ALL 
AWARDS BECAUSE BUT FOR YOU, WE 
WOULD HAVE HAD A LEGITIMATE 
PRESIDENT ELECTED. 
I YIELD BACK MY TIME. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK 
IS RECOGNIZED FOR UNANIMOUS 
CONSENT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, AS YOU ARE 
AWARE, MY MINORITY LEADERS HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO DEMAND HEARINGS TO 
ALLOW WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. 
AS YOU KNOW DURING THE COURSE 
OF TODAY'S HEARING, THE 
MAJORITY OPPOSE REPRESENTATIVE 
MOTION TO SUBPOENA STEVE BANNON 
FOR TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF OF 
THE MINORITY MEMBERS OF THE 
JUDICIARY AND GOVERNMENT REFORM 
COMMITTEE'S, I'M DELIVERING A 
LETTER TO THE CHAIRMAN AND TO 
CHAIRMAN GOWDY, FORMALLY 
INVOKING OUR RIGHT TO CALL THE 
MINARDI DAVE HEARING SO THAT 
STEVE BANNON MAY TESTIFY AND I 
ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO INSERT 
A COPY OF THE LETTER. 
>> WITH OBJECTION. 
THE GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGE'S 
RECOGNIZED. 
>> MR. STRZOK, I APPRECIATE YOU 
BEING HERE AND I WILL ASSURE 
YOU THAT I TAKE THIS VERY 
SERIOUSLY BUT I WANT TO COME AS 
YOU GO AND LOOK AND THERE HAS 
BEEN A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT 
TEXTING AND ABOUT YOUR BIAS AND 
NON-BIAS IN YOUR OPINIONS AND 
YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ELABORATE 
ON THAT. 
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WILL 
NOT REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE TO BE 
ELABORATE OR ANYTHING. 
THEY WILL BE SIMPLE AND 
STRAIGHTFORWARD. 
AS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH 
THIS AND TALKING TO THE CURRENT 
FBI DIRECTOR AND THE CURRENT 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND 
READING THROUGH THEM THINGS, 
THINGS HAVE POPPED UP THAT I 
THINK NEED SOME CLARIFICATION. 
WHAT WAS LAST TIME YOU WERE 
SUBJECT TO A POLYGRAPH? 
>> APPROXIMATELY TWO OR THREE 
YEARS AGO.'S BACK TWO OR THREE 
YEARS AGO BUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
HAVE YOU EVER FAILED A 
POLYGRAPH OR FOUND TO BE OUT OF 
SCOPE? 
BUT I HAVE NEVER FAILED ONE. 
I WAS OUT OF SCOPE PRIOR TO MY 
LAST POLYGRAPH. 
>> AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN 
WHAT TIME? 
TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO? 
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC? 
BUT I THINK WE CAN CUT TO THE 
CHASE AND I THINK THERE IS AN 
EMAIL THAT TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE 
BEING OUT OF SCOPE WHICH 
GENERATED THE LAST POLYGRAPH. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO CUT TO THE 
CHASE. 
YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND SAY 
JANUARY 2016 WHEN YOU RECEIVE 
THE TEXT OR EMAIL? 
BUT IF THAT IS THE DATE, I WILL 
STIPULATE TO THAT. 
>> WE WILL TAKE THAT AS A 
STUPID RATION. 
HAS EXAMINER EVER ACCUSED OF 
USING COUNTERMEASURES DURING A 
POLYGRAPH AND -- 
>> NO. 
>> YOU HAVE RECEIVED EMAIL AND 
STABILITY TO THE POLYGRAPH OUT 
OF SCOPE IN JANUARY 2016. 
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, HOW LONG WAS 
YOUR POLYGRAPH OUT OF SCOPE? 
>> I DON'T KNOW I RECALL IT IS 
THE PENULTIMATE, SECOND TO THE 
LAST I HAD WAS WHEN I WAS A 
SUPERVISOR AT THE WASHINGTON 
FIELD OFFICE WHICH WOULD HAVE 
OCCURRED BETWEEN THE 2008 AND 
2011. 
MY UNDERSTANDING OF OUT OF 
SCOPE FOR THE FBI MEANS THAT 
POLYGRAPHS HAVE A FIVE-YEAR 
SPAN OF EFFECTIVENESS OR 
VALIDITY. 
WE HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE AND WE 
ARE TRYING TO INCLUDE, 
INCLUDING ME TRYING TO GET 
RIGHT INTO A PARTICULAR 
INTELLIGENCE COMPARTMENT. 
THEY RAN THE NAMES, ME AND SOME 
OTHERS OUT OF SCOPE WHICH 
HAPPENS BECAUSE POLYGRAPHS ARE 
-- THE LINE FOR POLYGRAPHS IS 
LONGER. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM IN 
THE MILITARY I UNDERSTAND THE 
LINE FOR POLYGRAPH AND THE 
DELAYS. 
YOU HAPPENED TO HOLD A JOB THAT 
IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE. 
THE QUESTION IS, I WOULD ASSUME 
TO ANSWER YOUR EVASIVENESS, YOU 
DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG YOU WERE 
OUT OF SCOPE YES OR NO? 
BUT THAT IS. 
I WAS TRYING TO RECANT. 
>> YES OR NO DO YOU KNOW HOW 
LONG YOU ARE OUT OF SCOPE? 
>> I DO NOT. 
>> WHAT STEPS WERE TAKEN TO 
BRING YOU INTO SCOPE? 
BUT I WENT AND HAD A POLYGRAPH. 
>> WAS THIS AFTER THE JANUARY 
16 LETTER THAT YOU RECEIVED? 
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
AFTERWARDS. 
>> IF YOU ARE OUT OF SCOPE, THE 
LAST TIME, WHEN WAS THE LAST 
TIME THAT YOU ACCESS CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION? 
>> NIGHT BEFORE LAST PREPARING 
FOR THIS. 
>> YOU CURRENTLY HAVE WHAT 
CLASSIFICATION? 
BUT I HAVE THE TOP-SECRET 
CLEARANCE WITH SOME FCI 
COMPARTMENTS. 
>> DURING THE TIME THAT YOU 
WERE OUT OF SCOPE, DID YOU HAVE 
ACCESS TO SEI? 
MAKE YES. 
>> ARE YOU AWARE THAT IT IS FBI 
PROCEDURE THAT A FAILURE OR OUT 
OF SCOPE POLYGRAPH DOES NOT 
DETERMINE A TOP-SECRET BUT A 
FAILURE OF THIS WOULD REQUIRE 
YOU TO BE READ OUT OF SEI 
ACCESS ALTHOUGH YOU COULD 
MAINTAIN YOUR TOP-SECRET AND 
THIS WAS A DIRECT ANSWER FROM A 
QUESTION THAT I POSED AND WAS 
RECEIVED WITHIN THE LAST WEEK. 
WERE YOU AWARE THAT YOU SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN READ OUT OF ANY SCI 
INFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF 
SCOPE ? BUT I BELIEVE YOU USED 
THEM WORD FAILURE AND I WAS NOT 
AWARE OF THE FACT THAT AN OUT 
OF SCOPE POLYGRAPH REQUIRED A 
READOUT OF SCI.  
>> I ACCEPT THAT BUT I WANT TO 
GO BACK TO THE QUESTION. 
THE ANSWER CAME BACK FROM THE 
FBI AND JUSTICE ITSELF,  THAT 
IT WAS -- THAT IS THE 
PROCEDURE. 
THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS, 
AFTER THE 26 -- YOU DID THE 
POLYGRAPH AT WHAT TIME? 
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE OUT OF 
SCOPE AND PRODDED BY GIVEN A 
POLYGRAPH AND WHEN WAS THAT? 
MacRI REGULATION IS A 2016 
TIMEFRAME BUT AFTER THAT EMAIL, 
I DO NOT KNOW WITHIN A MONTH OR 
TWO I THINK. 
>> ARE YOU AWARE IN THE 
PUBLICLY STATED VERSION THAT 
THERE HAS BEEN SERIOUS 
QUESTIONS AND ISSUES CONCERNING 
POLYGRAPH INFORMATION AND LACK 
OF POLYGRAPH PROCEDURES AT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FBI 
THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT BY THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL? 
>> I AM NOT -- GENERALLY AWARE 
THAT THERE WAS A REPORT BUT I'M 
NOT AWARE OF THE CONCLUSIONS. 
>> ONE OF THE GENERAL CONCERNS 
ON THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE 
OUT OF SCOPE AND THIS IS THE 
ANSWER COMING BACK FROM THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN READ OUT OF 
SCI. 
MY CONCERN IS IT,  DURING THIS 
TIMEFRAME YOU WERE INVOLVED IN 
TWO VERY HIGH PROFILE WHAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN GETTING READY 
FOR A SCI INFORMATION AT WHICH 
YOU WERE NOT READ OUT OF. 
THIS IS A CONCERN. 
IS NOTHING ELSE FROM THAT 
QUESTION BUT I HAVE NO FURTHER 
QUESTIONS. 
I AM FINISHED AND I YIELD BACK. 
>> I THINK THAT YOU MISSTATED 
THE CONCLUSION. 
I THINK THAT YOU SAID THAT -- 
'S BACK MR. STRZOK. 
SPENT FAILURE TO REQUIRED 
READOUT AND THAT IS NOT 
CONCLUDED. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA 
CONTROLS THE TIME. 
>> THE TIME IS OVER. 
THE TIME IS UP. 
>> MAY I RESPOND? 
BUT THERE WAS NO QUESTION. 
FROM THE DEPARTMENT  OF 
JUSTICE, I READ YOU THE ANSWER. 
>> MAY I COMMENT TO WHAT I 
BELIEVE IS A MISSTATEMENT? 
>> FROM YOUR ANSWER, WHEN I 
TOOK THAT TO BE IS IN THE EVENT 
OF A FAILURE, AN INDIVIDUAL 
SHOULD BE READ OUT. 
YOU ARE CONFLATING THAT WITH 
OUT OF SCOPE OR A FAILURE. 
IT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 
OUT OF SCOPE REQUIRES SOMEBODY 
TO BE READ OUT. 
IT MAY BE. 
IAM NOT A SECURITY 
PROFESSIONAL BUT YOU UP HERE. 
>> YOU ARE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE 
ANSWER THAT WE RECEIVED FROM 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND 
THAT IS THE ANSWER THAT YOU 
GAVE THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN OUT 
OF SYNC IN THE QUESTION NOW 
BECOMES, IS POLICIES AND 
PROVISIONS FAILED OR NOT? 
THIS IS A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION 
IF YOU ARE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
READ OUT. 
THAT IS MY FINAL ANSWER, 
STATEMENT, NOT A QUESTION, NOT 
-- I YIELD BACK. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE 
ISLAND IS RECOGNIZED. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I LOOK FORWARD 
TO A COUPLE OF EXTRA MINUTES AS 
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAVE 
HAD. 
SERVING ON THIS COMMITTEE, 
REPRESENTING -- THIS IS BEEN 
ONE OF THE GREATEST HONORS OF 
MY LIFE BUT THE CONDUCT OF THIS 
COMMITTEE TODAY HAS BEEN FOR ME 
TREMENDOUSLY SAD, EMBARRASSING, 
AND REALLY DANGEROUS TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY. 
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR 
THE WAY THAT YOUR BEEN TREATED 
BY THIS COMMITTEE. 
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE 
WATCHING, YOU OUGHT NOT WONDER 
WHY THEY HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE 
IN CONGRESS AND ARE SICK OF THE 
CIRCUS THAT THEY SAW BEING 
CONDUCTED IN THIS ROOM TODAY. 
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON URGENT 
ISSUES LIKE FAMILY SEPARATION, 
REASONABLE EFFORTS TO REDUCE 
GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES, CONSIDERING 
LEGISLATION TO REFORM OUR 
BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, 
PASSING LEGISLATION TO REDUCE 
THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, 
ADDRESSING THE INABILITY OF 
AMERICANS WHO FALL BEHIND IN 
THEIR STUDENT LOANS TO 
DISCHARGE THAT DEBT AND 
BANKRUPTCY OR OVERSIGHT OF THE 
MANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND 
CORRUPTION IN THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE HAVING 
YET ANOTHER HEARING ON THE 
HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS. 
WHAT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND, MR. 
STRZOK, IS THE REASON THAT MY 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WILL NOT 
LET YOU ANSWER A QUESTION IS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED 
IN YOUR ANSWERS. 
THIS IS ABOUT PROMOTING A 
NARRATIVE. 
YOU ARE BEING A -- YOU ARE A 
PROP SO THAT THEY CAN PROMOTE A 
NARRATIVE IN AN ONGOING EFFORT 
TO DISTRACT FROM THE SERIOUS 
INVESTIGATION OF THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL THAT IS CLOSING IN ON 
THE DONALD TRUMP INNER CIRCLE. 
THIS IS A CAMPAIGN. 
TO UNDERMINE THAT WORK AND 
SADLY DOING WHATEVER IS 
NECESSARY TO DO IT WITH -- IN 
CONCERT WITH THE PRESIDENT 
ATTACKED THE FBI AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND 
SO YOUR EMAILS ARE A PERFECT 
FOIL FOR THIS EFFORT. 
THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 
HEARING YOUR CONTACTS AND 
EXPLANATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT 
ABOUT YOU. 
IT IS ABOUT PROTECTING THE 
PRESENT. 
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ACTED MORE 
LIKE THEY ARE THE DEFENSE TEAM 
FOR DONALD TRUMP THEN 
EXERCISING THEIR VERY SERIOUS 
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES AS 
MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES. 
ROBERT MUELLER WAS PRAISED TO 
THE HEAVENS BY EVERYONE, 
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT ALIKE 
WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED. 
NOW HE IS A VILLAIN. 
WHAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT HAS 
CHANGED? 
19 INDICTMENTS. 
FIVE GUILTY PLEAS. 
AND THE CIRCLE IS CLOSING IT. 
SO I ACCEPT YOUR SWORN 
TESTIMONY ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN BIAS AND THE ACTIONS 
THAT YOU TOOK. 
WE DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE YOUR 
WORD FOR IT. 
I DO. 
THE IG REPORTED 500 PAGES 
INTERVIEWS, REVIEW OF 
DOCUMENTS, COMES TO THE SAME 
CONCLUSIONS. 
WE FIND THE DECISIONS MADE WERE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE ANALYTIC 
APPROACH DESCRIBED ABOVE. 
WE FOUND THAT THESE SPECIFIC 
DECISIONS WORTHY OF ALL IS A 
RESULT OF DISCRETIONARY 
JUDGMENTS MADE BY THE AGE OF 
AND PROSECUTORS AND THAT THEY 
WERE ALL REASONABLE. 
SO IT IS -- THERE IS A BIG 
ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE IS IT 
LOTS? 
500 PAGES. 
THAT IS THE SAME CONCLUSION AND 
SAME REPRESENTATION YOU HAVE 
MADE TODAY. 
DO NOT BE FRUSTRATED. 
THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 
THAT. 
THIS IS ABOUT PROMOTING THE 
NARRATIVE. 
WE KNOW MR. STRZOK THAT THE 
PRESIDENT THIS WEEK THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES 
UNEQUIVOCALLY CONCLUDED THAT 
RUSSIA INTERFERED IN OUR 
ELECTIONS. 
IT WAS DIRECTED BY VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
FOR THE PURPOSES OF HELPING 
DONALD TRUMP AND HURTING 
HILLARY CLINTON. 
ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 
MECH YES. 
>> TO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO 
DOUBT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES MADE WITH 
HIGH CONFIDENCE? 
>> NO. 
>> THEREAFTER THE DEFENDANT 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND A 
REPUBLICAN-LED COMMITTEE CAME 
TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. 
>> YES. 
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND MEMBERS OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION CONTINUE TO DENY 
THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 
INTERFERED IN ELECTIONS. 
AS RECENTLY AS JUNE 28 THE 
PRESIDENT SAID THAT RUSSIA 
CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THEY HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDDLING IN 
THE ELECTION. 
EVEN SECRETARY NIELSEN SAID 
THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I 
HAVE SEEN THE CONCLUSION OF THE 
SPECIFIC INTENT TO HELP 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WIN. 
IN ADDITION TO THAT, YOU KNOW 
ABOUT THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING. 
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION BETWEEN 
MEMBERS OF THE DONALD TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN 
OPERATIVES. 
>> I AM AWARE OF THAT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT THIS SPRING I 
WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE IT ONE 
WAY OR THE OTHER. 
OPERATIVES OR NOT. 
I AM AWARE OF IT. 
>> IN THAT MEETING THERE WAS A 
DISCUSSION ABOUT THEIR THAT THE 
RUSSIANS HAD ON HILLARY 
CLINTON. 
SMACKING THE MEDIA REPORTING 
INDICATED THAT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT ISSUED A 
STATEMENT IN WHICH HE LIED 
ABOUT THE MEETING AND SAID IT 
WAS ABOUT AN ADOPTION 
DISCUSSION. 
CORRECT? 
MAKE THE STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN 
MADE. 
I AM RELYING ON WHAT HAS BEEN 
REPORTED IN THE MEDIA AND NOT 
THE FBI. 
>> WOULD YOU TELL ME THE TIME I 
HAVE REMAINING, WHAT SHOULD WE 
CONCLUDE? 
WHAT RAISES EYEBROWS TO YOU úAB 
CAMPAIGN MEETING WITH A FOREIGN 
ADVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES 
TO TALK ABOUT DIRT FROM -- 
ABOUT THEIR OPPONENT AND THEN 
LYING ABOUT THE NATURE OF THAT 
MEETING? 
WHAT SHOULD WE -- WHY SHOULD 
THAT CONCERN THE MECCA PEOPLE? 
MECH I DO NOT WANT TO -- I DO 
NOT WANT TO COMMENT ON A 
SPECIFIC FACT PATTERN OR 
ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO AND AN 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 
I HESITATE AND I DO NOT WANT TO 
DO THAT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD LIKE TO 
NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT WE 
HAVE HAD ZERO HEARINGS ON 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 
AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
ZERO HEARING IN THIS COMMITTEE 
ABOUT OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE THE 
DEMOCRACY AND THE ELECTIONS 
COMING UP IN NOVEMBER. 
WE HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF HOURS 
DEVOTED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S 
EMAIL. 
THIS COMMITTEE HAS FAILED IN 
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO SECURE 
OUR ELECTIONS WHICH IS THE 
RESPONSIBILIY WE HAVE THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE FINALLY 
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE 
THE ISSUE WE ARE GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAIL. 
SHAME ON ALL OF YOU. 
>> VERY HARSHLY FOR THIS 
BEHAVIOR. 
MAKE THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
FLORIDA. 
MR. DESANTIS FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MR. STRZOK YOU HAVE DEFENDED 
YOUR ACTIONS AND SAID THAT YOU 
DID NOT HAVE BIAS AND YOUR 
ACTIONS WERE NOT MOTIVATED BY 
BIAS BUT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
DISAGREE. 
HE ASKED YOU ABOUT THE 
INSURANCE POLICY TEXT, THE WILL 
STOP IT TEXT. 
YOU PROVIDED AN EXPLANATION 
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU DID TODAY. 
HE FOUND YOUR EXPLANATION TO BE 
UNPERSUASIVE AND YOU ARE AWARE 
OF THAT. 
>> I AM NOT AWARE OF THAT WITH 
REGARD TO THE TEXT. 
>> HE TESTIFIED WHEN WE HAD HIM 
IN JUNE  AND WHEN -- IN 
RESPONSE TO MY QUESTIONING. 
HE ALSO SAID THAT YOUR 
EXPLANATION FOR HOW YOU HANDLED 
THE ANTHONY WEINER LAPTOP -- 
DELAYED AND YOU DID NOT TAKE 
ACTION INITIALLY. 
HE SAID THAT YOUR EXPLANATION 
FOR THAT AS HE DID NOTE THAT IN 
THE REPORT WAS NOT PERSUASIVE. 
YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT. 
>> I AM AWARE OF THE FACTS 
REBUTTING THAT HE HAS REBUTTING 
THAT SPECIFIC ASSERTION. 
SMACKING TESTIFIED TO US THAT 
HE WAS NOT PERSUADED BY YOUR 
EXPLANATION. 
FOR WHY YOU FOCUSED ON THE 
DONALD TRUMP AND RUSSIA 
COLLUSION AND YOU LET THE 
WEINER THINGS SIT AND THAT HE 
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF OUR 
COMMITTEE THAT IT WAS 
REASONABLE TO INFER THAT YOUR 
ACTIONS INVOLVING WEINER'S 
LAPTOP, THE FACT THAT YOU DID 
NOT PURSUE THAT, AGGRESSIVELY, 
THAT IT IS REASONABLE FOR YOU 
TO INFER THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF 
THE BIAS THAT YOU EVINCED IN 
THOSE TEXT MESSAGES. 
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT? 
MECH NOT SPECIFIC TO THAT BUT I 
WILL ACCEPT YOUR 
REPRESENTATION. 
>> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
SHOW THAT WHILE THE REPORT SAID 
THAT THE CLINTON CHARGING 
DECISION WAS NOT DUE TO BIAS. 
HE SAID THAT  THE WEINER IS 
ABSOLUTELY A FAIR GAME TO INFER 
THAT, AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY 
ARE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE 
THE GENESIS OF THIS RUSSIA 
INTERFERENCE CASE. 
DO YOU ALSO KNOW THAT ROD 
ROSENSTEIN ON JUNE 28 WHEN HE 
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF THIS 
COMMITTEE, HE SAID THAT YOU 
WERE BIASED ARE YOU AWARE OF 
THAT? 
MECH I AM NOT. 
>> RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION, 
YES, HE DID, AND HE ALSO SAID 
THAT THE BIAS THAT YOU EVINCED 
DOES UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF 
YOUR INVESTIGATIVE ACTIONS. 
IT CAUSES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
INSTITUTION. 
DO YOU KNOW THAT HE SAID THAT? 
MECH I DO NOT. 
>> HE DID.  
I JUST -- THE IDEA THAT THERE 
IS NO BIAS IS NOT -- I DO NOT 
THINK THAT YOUR EXPLANATIONS 
HAVE BEEN CREDIBLE. 
I THINK THAT IF YOU ACTED SO 
APPROPRIATELY, MUELLER -- 
ROBERT MUELLER REMOVED YOU FROM 
THE TEAM AND YOU ARE IN HUMAN 
RESOURCES WHICH IS A DIMENSION. 
YOU ARE NOW ONE OF THE SUBJECTS 
OF AN ONGOING IG INVESTIGATION. 
>> NO. 
>>> YOUR CONDUCT IS NOT BEING 
REVIEWED BY HORWITZ ABOUT WHAT 
YOU DID OR DID NOT DO IN THE 
RUSSIAN COLLUSION? 
MECH I AM UNAWARE OF BEING THE 
SUBJECT OF AN ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
YOU OPENED UP THE 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
INVESTIGATION ON 31 JULY. 
WAS THAT BECAUSE OF THE GEORGE 
PAPADOPOULOS INFORMATION? 
>> SIR, I CANNOT GET INTO THE 
GUIDANCE THAT THE FBI HAS 
PROVIDED ME ABOUT ANSWERS THAT 
I CAN PROVIDE. 
THAT GETS INTO A LEVEL OF 
DETAIL THAT I CANNOT I HAVE 
BEEN DIRECTED NOT TO. 
>> YOU HAVE ANSWERED SOME 
QUESTIONS. 
THIS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF 
CONVENIENCE. 
YOU HAVE ANSWERED QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THEIR HIS GRAVE CONCERNS 
AND ALL OF THIS STUFF ABOUT WHY 
YOU ARE DOING IT. 
YOU DID NOT DO THAT. 
THE DOSSIER. 
WAS THE DOSSIER A PART OF WHY 
YOU OPEN UP THE INVESTIGATION? 
>> NO. 
NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN 
CONVENIENCE. 
THIS IS BASED ON WHAT THE 
DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED OUT WITH 
THE CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE ABOUT 
WHAT IS PERMITTED AND THAT. 
IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE -- 
>> THE DOSSIER WAS NOT A PART 
OF THAT. 
THAT IS IMPORTANT. 
WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT THE 
DOSSIER WAS FUNDED BY HILLARY 
CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY? 
MECH I CANNOT -- I DO NOT THINK 
THAT IS AN ACCURATE 
REPRESENTATION AND THE FBI 
DIRECTED ME NOT TO ANSWER THE 
QUESTION BASED ON --'S BACK 
RIGHT. 
HILLARY AND THE DNC WENT TO 
FUSION WHO PAID --,. 
IT WAS A POLITICAL DOCUMENT. 
CORRECT? 
MECH THE LATTER IS CLOSER TO I 
CANNOT COMMENT. 
THE FBI HAS DIRECTED ME TO NOT 
ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT 
THE DOSSIER -- WHAT WOULD YOU 
CHOOSE? 
IS IT A POLITICAL DOCUMENT? 
IS IT LEGITIMATE INTELLIGENCE? 
>> I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO 
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. 
I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED BY THE FBI 
THAT I MIGHT NOT GET INTO THE 
BASIN OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
OR EQUITIES. 
>> HERE'S THE ISSUE THAT I 
THINK WE HAVE WE SEE THE BIAS 
THAT YOU DID. 
YOUR EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY YOU 
SAID WHAT YOU DID. 
THEY REALLY ARE NOT CREDIBLE. 
WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE 
GENESIS OF WHY OPEN UP A 
COUTERINTELLIGENCE 
INVESTIGATION AGAINST THE 
OPPOSING PARTY'S CAMPAIGN? 
I AM WITH YOU ABOUT FOCUSING ON 
RUSSIA AND HOLDING THEM 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
YOU TRIED TO ROPE IN THE OTHER 
PARTY'S NOMINEE. 
THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF BIAS. 
WE CAN GET ANSWERS TO THE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE 
GENESIS OF ANY OF THIS WISE. 
LET ME FINISH. 
MAY 18, CHAIRMAN GOWDY 
MENTIONED YOU SAY, MY CONCERN 
IS THAT THERE IS NO BIG THERE 
THERE. 
THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR AT 
LEAST 10 MONTHS. 
I THINK IT WAS GOING ON BEFORE 
JULY 31. 
THERE YOU ARE, ROBERT MUELLER'S 
APPOINTED, AND YOU CANNOT 
IDENTIFY ANY REASON TO SUSPECT 
THAT THERE WAS COLLUSION 
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN 
AND RUSSIA. 
THERE WAS NO BIG THERE THERE 
AFTER 10 MONTHS. 
SO THAT IS THE BIG CONCERN IS 
THAT SOMEBODY LIKE YOU WHO 
SAID, WELL, STOP HIM. 
WE NEEDED INSURANCE POLICY. 
YOU LET THAT BUYS. 
YOU WANTED THERE TO BE 
SOMETHING THERE. 
YOU WANTED IT TO BE TRUE. 
THAT, I THINK IS INFLUENCING 
YOUR ACTIONS. 
YOU CAN PROVE US WRONG BY 
PROVIDING US INFORMATION I 
WOULD LIKE INFORMATION ON ANY 
TYPE OF INFORMANTS. 
BEFORE JULY 31. 
I WOULD LIKE THE INFORMATION ON 
WHAT YOU USED TO OPERA -- OPEN 
UP THE INVESTIGATION BUT I WANT 
TO KNOW WHETHER THAT WAS 
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE VAULT OR 
IF IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. 
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IF WE 
JUST PUT THOSE OUT AND ANSWER 
THEM, THEN A LOT OF US WOULD BE 
ABLE TO THEN MAKE, I THINK, THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN MAKE A 
JUDGMENT. 
I'M GOING OVER MY TIME AND I 
YIELD BACK. 
>>  THE NEXT QUESTION. 
BRIEFLY. 
>> SIR, TO THE WHY I CANNOT 
EXPLAIN WHY A CASE WOULD BE 
OPEN, I DO NOT THINK THAT IS 
ACCURATE. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIRECTOR'S 
STATEMENT WHEN THE DEPARTMENT 
OF JUSTICE AUTHORIZED HIM TO 
SAY THAT THEY HAD OPEN THE CASE 
AND TO ALLEGATIONS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA HAD MADE 
AN OFFER OF ASSISTANCE IN THE 
POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT OF 
MEMBERS OF THE DONALD TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN, I CANNOT ENVISION A 
SCENARIO WHERE THAT WOULD NOT 
BE A REASONABLE PREDICATION TO 
OPEN AN INVESTIGATION. 
>> IT IS PAPADOPOULOS. 
THAT IS NOT QUITE WHAT THEY 
HAD. 
YOU DID NOT QUITE GET THERE BUT 
I KNOW THAT JAMES COMEY MAY 
HAVE SAID THAT BUT YOU DID NOT 
GET THERE. 
IT IS PAPADOPOULOS. 
THAT IS WEAK. 
>> I THINK THAT THE 
CHARACTERIZATION WAS THAT IT 
WAS A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF 
INFORMATION STANDS ON HIS UPPER 
ANYBODY IN THIS COMMITTEE WOULD 
NOT ARGUE THAT, ONE, IT WAS NOT 
APPROPRIATE TO OPEN THAT AND, 
TWO, THAT IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY 
-- 
>> WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT IF 
IT WAS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE WE 
DO NOT KNOW THE INFORMATION. 
WE READ IT IN THE NEW YORK 
TIMES FROM LEAKS BECAUSE IS 
PAPADOPOULOS SAID IN A BAR. 
>> THE TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
>> THAT IS THE REASON. 
>>> REGULAR ORDER. 
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
CHAIRMAN. 
>> THERE IS A SECOND ELEMENT OF 
THE QUESTION. 
>> NO. 
YOU RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT 
WHETHER OR NOT I AGREED WITH 
INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT I HAD 
ACTED IN A WAY THAT WAS BIASED. 
>> YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
ANSWER THAT? 
MAY I DID NOT. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM  ILLINOIS 
IS RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
THANK YOU MR. STRZOK. 
MR. STRZOK, ON JULY 3, YOUR 
LAWYER, MR. GOLDEN MADE THE 
FOLLOWING STATEMENT TO CHRIS 
CUOMO AND CNN REGARDING UCONN 
HIS CLIENT. 
ON FOX NEWS THEY TALK ABOUT HIM 
AS THE CENTER OF THIS ANTI-
DONALD TRUMP THAT WAS 
DETERMINED TO THROW THE 
ELECTION AGAINST DONALD TRUMP  
NONE OF THIS HAS A SHRED OF 
TRUTH DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS 
STATEMENT? 
MECH I DO. 
>> IN A JUNE 19 OP-ED IN USA 
TODAY, YOUR LAWYER SAID, 
REGARDING THE RUSH 
INVESTIGATION, WHAT WE CALL THE 
RUSSIA INCLUSION INVESTIGATION 
THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM QUOTE 
UNQUOTE WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY 
TO PREVENT LEAKS AND ACTIVELY 
ENSURED THAT NEWS REPORTS DID 
NOT OVERPLAY THE SERIOUSNESS OF 
THE INVESTIGATION. 
IS THAT TRUE? 
>> YES. 
>> NOW TELL US WHY DO SO 
IMPORTANT TO PREVENT LEAKS FROM 
THE FBI TO JOURNALISTS OR TO 
OTHERS. 
>> LEAKS ARE TERRIBLE. 
THEY UNDERCUT THINGS IN A 
VARIETY OF WAYS. 
THEY CAN UPEND INVESTIGATIONS. 
THEY CAN LEAD TO INCORRECT 
ASSUMPTIONS. 
THEY CAN LET WITNESSES AND 
SUBJECTS KNOW THAT THEY ARE BE 
INVESTIGATED. 
THEY CAN LEAD TO WILD 
SPECULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF 
EVIDENCE AND ANY BAD DISCLOSURE 
OR INFORMATION. 
ANY NUMBER OF BAD ADVERSE 
THINGS. 
>> THE DOJ, IG REPORT HAS THIS 
TO SAY ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT 
AND THE DECISION TO INFORM 
CONGRESS ABOUT THE WEINER 
LAPTOP. 
QUOTE UNQUOTE, PETER STRZOK 
EXPLAINED THAT THE DECISION TO 
SEEK A SEARCH WORN FOR THE 
WEINER LAPTOP WAS KNOWN TO MANY 
PEOPLE BEYOND THE MIDYEAR TEAM 
ON THIS RAISED A CONCERN THAT 
THIS INFORMATION COULD LEAK. 
IS THIS STATEMENT FROM THE IG 
REPORT TRUE? 
>> YES. 
>> NOW, CAN YOU UNPACK THAT FOR 
US IN THE BIT? 
FIRST OF ALL, YOU SAID 
ACCORDING TO THE IG REPORT THAT 
THE SEARCH WARRANT FOR THE 
WEINER LAPTOP WAS KNOWN TO MANY 
PEOPLE BEYOND THE MIDYEAR TEAM. 
COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHETHER ANY 
OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE IN THE 
NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE?  
>> SO THE -- MY REGULATION IS 
THAT THE INVESTIGATION OF THE 
CRIMES AGAINST -- AGAINST MR. 
WEINER WAS HANDLED OUT IN THAT 
FIELD OFFICES BY THE EASTERN 
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.  
BACK SO THE PEOPLE TO WHOM YOU 
ARE REFERRING INCLUDED PEOPLE 
FROM THE NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE. 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
YOU DID NOT INFORM CONGRESS 
ABOUT THIS WEINER LAPTOP? 
MECH I DID NOT HAVE CONCERNS 
ABOUT NEW YORK MY CONCERNS WERE 
GENERAL AND THE MORE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE AWARE OF SOMETHING THE 
BETTER CHANCE THAT IT LEAKS OUT 
SOMEHOW. 
THESE CONCERNS ARE NOT SPECIFIC 
TO NEW YORK. 
>>> OKAY. 
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS. 
IN A REPORT IN THAT SAME 
REPORT, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
LORETTA LYNCH RECALLED A 
CONVERSATION WITH HER THEN 
DIRECTOR COMEY IN THE FINAL 
DAYS OF THE 2016 ELECTION. 
QUOTE UNQUOTE, HE, REFERRING TO 
JAMES COMEY SAID, IT IS CLEAR 
TO ME THAT THERE IS A CADRE OF 
SENIOR PEOPLE IN NEW YORK WHO 
HAVE A DEEP HATRED OF SECRETARY 
CLINTON AND HE SAID, IT IS 
QUOTE UNQUOTE DEEP. 
WERE YOU AWARE OF THIS CONCERN? 
>> I WAS AWARE OF OTHER 
CERTAINLY SOME OF THE PRESS 
REPORTING OF SOME PEOPLE 
EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERN. 
YES. 
>> WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE 
DIRECTOR COMEY? 
>> THE PERSON HAVING THAT 
CONCERN? 
YES. 
ú>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME  
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND HOW 
THAT IN YOUR VIEW AFFECTED THE 
REVELATION OF THE WARRANT FOR 
WEINER'S LAPTOP? 
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK 
DIRECTOR COMEY. 
I THINK THAT THERE WAS 
DISCUSSION. 
I REMEMBER PRACTICALLY SOME OF 
IT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF 
REPORTING FROM MR. GIULIANI AND 
OTHERS TALKING ABOUT 
CONNECTIONS TO NEW YORK. 
BUT AGAIN, I DO NOT WANT TO 
SCAPEGOAT NEW YORK BECAUSE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF IT 
AND THERE WERE CONCERNS JUST 
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS, BUT 
WITH REGARD TO MR. COMEY, MY 
RECOLLECTION IS THAT HE WAS 
AWARE OF THE CONCERNS BUT I WAS 
NOT PRIVY TO DISCUSSIONS THAT 
HE HAD WITH THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL OR OTHER CONCERNS HE 
MIGHT HAVE HAD OUTSIDE OF MY 
PRESENCE OR CONVERSATION. 
>> WITH REGARD TO RUDY 
GIULIANI, ON OCTOBER 25, RUDY 
GIULIANI PROMISED A QUOTE 
UNQUOTE PRETTY BIG SURPRISE 
COMING UP IN THE CAMPAIGN. 
ON OCTOBER 28, RUDY GIULIANI 
CLAIM TO BE IN CONTACT WITH THE 
FORMER AGENTS AND A QUOTE 
UNQUOTE FEW ACTIVE AGENTS WHO 
OBVIOUSLY DO NOT WANT TO 
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. 
LET ME MAKE SURE I HAVE THIS 
RIGHT. 
THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THERE 
WAS A DEEP AND VISCERAL HATRED 
TOWARDS SECRETARY CLINTON IN 
THE NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE. 
AT THE SAME TIME RUDY GIULIANI 
SAID HE IS HAVING CONTACT WITH 
AGENTS. 
ACTIVE AGENTS. 
WHAT IS -- CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR 
TAKE ON THIS AND YOUR COMMENTS 
ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE? 
MECH I RECALL THE COMMENT THAT 
CAUSE ME CONCERN.
GIVEN THE TIMING IT CAUSED ME 
GREAT CONCERN THAT HE IS IN 
REMISSIO ABOUT THAT. 
>> IN OTHER WORDS -- THAT HE 
SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD? 
THROUGH A LEAK? 
>> THROUGH AN UNAUTHORIZED 
DISCLOSURE, A LEAK, YES. 
>> THE MEMBER IS ADVISED THAT 
THERE ARE VOTES ON THE FLOOR OF 
THE HOUSE. 4 
VOTES. 
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD 45 
MINUTES. 
>> ALL RIGHT, MEMBERS ARE 
ADVISED THAT THIS WILL BE THE 
LAST ONE. 
IF YOU WANT TO HEAD TO THE 
FLOOR FOR VOTES. 
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE MAN 
FROM KENTUCKY, MR. MASSEY. 
>> I YIELD MY MINUTES TO THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO, MR. JORDAN.
>> SIR, I CANNOT HEAR YOU. 
>> AGENT STRZOK, IN AN EARLIER  
ROUND YOU SAID YOU NEVER SPOKE 
WITH GLENN SIMPSON, RIGHT? 
YOU NEVER SPOKE TO NELLY OR, 
AND YOU WOULD NOT SAY WHETHER 
YOU KNEW -- IF NELLY ORR WORKED 
FOR FUSION, CORRECT? 
>> MY DIRECTION  IS THAT I AM 
NOT PERMITTED TO ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
>> YOU DID TALK WITH BRUCE ORR, 
FELLOW  EMPLOYEE AND NELLY'S 
HUSBAND? 
>> YES. 
>> IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT 
NELLY ORR WORKED FOR FUSION, IS 
THAT RIGHT? 
>> I DO NOT KNOW  IF IT IS 
COMMON KNOWLEDGE. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
YOU MET WITH BRUCE ORR IN 2016 
AND 2017.  
>> TO THE BEST OF MY 
RECOLLECTION, YES. 
>> I CAN TELL YOU, WE SPOKE 
ABOUT OPERATIONAL MATTERS THAT 
HE WAS INVOLVED IN, BUT THE FBI 
HAS DIRECTED ME NOT TO GIVE YOU 
-- SPECIFICS. 
>> ALL RIGHT, DID BRUCE OHR 
GIVE YOU ANY DOCUMENTS? 
>> SAME ANSWER,  I WOULD LIKE 
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, BUT THE
FBI HAS DIRECTED ME NOT TO GET 
INTO -- 
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- MR. 
CHAIRMAN, THE DISCUSSIONS THAT 
WE HAVE HAD WITH THE FBI, HE IS 
ALLOWED TO TELL US THOSE KIND 
OF -- PIECES OF INFORMATION. I 
HAVE BEEN ASKING WHAT THE 
DOCUMENTS WERE, I WANTED TO 
KNOW,  DID BRUCE OHR EVER  AND 
YOU DOCUMENTS? 
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT 
WHEN IT COMES TO OPERATIONAL 
DETAILS, INCLUDING WHETHER OR 
NOT WE COLLECTED EVIDENCE, AND 
NOT PERMITTED TO ANSWER THAT. 
I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
>> YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M 
COMING FROM, RIGHT AGENT 
STRZOK? 
>> I UNDERSTAND.  
I AM HERE TO TELL YOU -- 
>> YOU UNDERSTAND WE GOT AN 
EMAIL FROM YOU, BRIEFING 
EVERYBODY ON THE TEAM, ALL THE 
KEY PLAYERS BAKER, PAGE, MOFFAT,
PRE-STEP, AND ANDY McKAY. 
AND, IN THAT HE NOW, YOU SAY 
THAT THE DOSSIER THAT YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT,  IT HAS DIFFERENCES 
FROM THE ONE GIVEN TO US BY 
CORN AND SIMPSON. EARLIER TODAY 
I ASKED YOU WHO THAT IS IN YOU 
WOULD NOT ANSWER THAT. 
IT IS KIND OF FUNNY TO ME, 
BECAUSE YESTERDAY DAVID CORN 
TWEETED OUT THAT HE IS THE CORN 
IN YOUR EMAIL. 
THE GUY HIMSELF HAS IDENTIFIED 
HIMSELF. 
WE ALL KNOW WHO IT IS. 
AND, THE OTHER NAME IS SIMPSON. 
SO, YOU HAVE THIS, AND WE ARE 
WONDERING HOW THE DOSSIER GOT 
TO OHR, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
IF IT GOT TO THE FBI THROUGH  
MEDIA SOURCES, NOT JUST THROUGH 
CHRISTOPHER STEELE. 
OF COURSE, WE KNOW NELLY OHR 
WORKED FOR THE GUY YOU 
MENTIONED, GLENN SIMPSON.  
SHE WORKED FOR HIM. 
THE WHOLE TIME. 
YOU HAVE NEVER HAD 
CONVERSATIONS WITH HER, BUT YOU 
DID HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT 
CONVERSATIONS ON OPERATIONAL 
MATTERS AND ONGOING 
INVESTIGATIONS WITH HER 
HUSBAND, BRUCE OHR,  WHO ALSO 
HAPPENS TO BE REASSIGNED AT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
AND YOU HAVE SAID THAT -- WELL, 
YOU WILL NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT MR. OHR HAS 
GIVEN YOU DOCUMENTS OR NOT. 
I'M WONDERING  WAS THAT THE 
ROUTE THE DOSSIER WENT?  
GLENN SIMPSON, NELLY OHR, TO 
HER HUSBAND, AND THEN TO YOU? 
>> SIR --  I UNDERSTAND YOUR 
QUESTION, I UNDERSTAND YOUR 
FRUSTRATION, I UNDERSTAND THE 
ABSURDITY OF SOMETHING PRODUCED 
THAT YOU ARE READING THAT I 
HAVE BEEN DIRECTED NOT TO 
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT. 
THE BEST -- I WOULD LIKE TO 
ANSWER YOU, AND I'M AFRAID THAT 
IT IS AN ANSWER THAT WOULD BOTH 
REASSURE YOU AND DISAPPOINT 
YOU. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO BE ASKING 
THE FBI AND THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE TO GIVE US THOSE 
DOCUMENTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT 
HAVE BEEN EXCHANGE BETWEEN MR. 
OHR  AND AGENT STRZOK. 
I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THE 
COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE,  
AND SEE IF IN FACT THERE WERE 
DOCUMENTS, WHAT THE HECK THEY 
WERE. 
I HAV A MINUTE, I WILL YIELD 
IT -- 
>> SIR, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE 
THIS, I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED, 
THE FBI HAS TOLD ME THAT I CAN 
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
RECEIPT OF THE DOCUMENT. 
SO, I WILL DEFER IF YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO -- 
>> WELL, HOW -- 
>> THE GENTLEMAN MAY PROCEED 
WITH HIS QUESTIONS, AND YOU 
MANSOUR. 
>> BEFORE, ME I CONFER WITH 
COUNSEL THE FLEET TO SEE IF 
THIS IS COMPLETELY UNBOUNDED, OR
ANY LIMITATIONS ON WHAT I MAY 
SAY? 
>> I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS I 
HAVE ASKED ALL DAY LONG. 
>> LET'S ASK THE ONE YOU HAVE 
BEEN TOLD YOU CAN ANSWER. 
>> WHICH QUESTION, SIR? 
>> THE DOCUMENTS. 
>> THE DOCUMENTS WERE RECEIVED 
FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE AND THE 
INITIAL BATCH WAS IN MID-
SEPTEMBER. 
>> NO, I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING -- 
YOU SAID YOU GOT -- GO BACK, 
DID YOU GET DOCUMENTS FROM 
BRUCE OHR?  
>> YES. 
>> YOU GOT DOCUMENTS FROM BRUCE 
OHR, AND WHAT WERE THEY? 
>>  WE RECEIVED DOCUMENTS FROM 
MR. OHR, NOT ME  -- EXCUSE ME 
SIR. 
>> I CAN MAYBE MAKE IT SIMPLER 
-- AGENT STRZOK, WAS IT THE 
DOSSIER? 
>>  WHAT I'M AUTHORIZED TO TELL 
YOU IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION 
-- DID YOU RECEIVE ANY 
DOCUMENTS FROM BRUCE OHR, THE 
FBI HAS  DIRECTED ME THAT I MAY 
SAY THAT -- NOT ME, THE FBI 
RECEIVED DOCUMENTS AND MATERIAL 
FROM MR. OHR.  
>> DID YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT. 
I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT YOU DID 
NOT FOR MR. OHR.  
BUT, THE FBI DID GET DOCUMENTS 
FROM BRUCE OHR? 
DID THEY GET THE DOSSIER FROM  
MR. OHR ? 
>> THE FBI RECEIVED MATERIAL 
FROM MR. OHR. 
CONGRESSMAN -- 
>> THIS IS AMAZING, THIS IS 
AMAZING. 
SO,  NELLY OHR WORKS FOR 
FUSION,  WORKS FOR GLENN 
SIMPSON, AND SHE IS GIVING 
DOCUMENTS -- 
>> REGULAR ORDER PLEASE. 
LET US BRING THE DIRECTOR OF 
THE FBI TO ANSWER THOSE 
QUESTIONS. 
THE GENTLEMAN CANNOT ANSWER. 
ASKED AND ANSWERED. 
HE HAS ANSWERED. 
HE CANNOT ANSWER. 
>> THE REGULAR ORDER -- 
>> I UNDERSTAND MR. CHAIRMAN, 
REGULAR ORDER. 
>> FBI HAS INSTRUCTED MR. 
STRZOK THAT HE CAN ANSWER 
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.  
AND -- 
>> AGENT STRZOK , -- 
>> THE FBI APPROVED, HAVE THEY 
ALSO GIVEN YOU PERMISSION TO 
SAY OF GLENN SIMPSON IS THE 
NAME THAT YOU USED IN THE EMAIL 
WHERE YOU SAY SIMPSON? 
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
GIVEN ME GUIDANCE. 
MY MOST RECENT UNDERSTANDING OF 
MY GUIDANCE FROM THE FBI IS IN 
RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF 
WHETHER THE FBI RECEIVED 
DOCUMENTS FROM -- 
>> AS THE FBI -- 
>> -- OR, THE ANSWER IS -- 
>> HAS THE FBI GIVING YOU 
INFORMATION TO TELL ME WHETHER 
YOU KNEW THAT NELLY OHR WORKED 
FOR FUSION AT THE TIME YOUR 
MEETING WITH HER HUSBAND? 
>> TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THE FBI HAS 
NOT DIRECTED ME TO  -- OR 
ALLOWED ME TO RESPOND TO THAT. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
I YIELD BACK, THANK YOU. 
>> THE COMMITTEE WILL STAND IN 
RECESS UNTIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
THIS SERIES OF VOTES. 
>>> HELLO EVERYONE, I AM ELAINE 
QUIJANO IN NEW YORK. 
YOU HAVE  BEEN LISTENING TO 
LAWMAKERS GRILL PETER STRZOK  
ON CAPITOL HILL. 
HE SENT ANTI-TRUMP TEXTS AS HE 
WAS TAKING PART IN ELECTION 
RELATED AND INSTIGATION'S IN 
2016. 
HE HAS DENIED THAT HIS PERSONAL 
BIAS IMPACTED HIS WORK, BUT 
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE 
BEGGED TO DISAGREE. 
THIS HAS BEEN A MARATHON 
HEARING THAT STARTED JUST AFTER 
10 AM EASTERN TIME. 
IN ALL, STRZOK HAS FACED SIX 
HOURS OF QUESTIONING. 
WE WILL IMPACT THIS HEARING IN 
JUST A MOMENT. 
BUT, WE BEGIN TONIGHT'S
