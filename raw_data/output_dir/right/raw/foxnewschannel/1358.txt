00:00:01,158 --> 00:00:07,965
THANK YOU.

2
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:09,567
>> Melissa: JUST ONE YEAR INTO

3
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,502
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM.

4
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:12,536
ONE REPUBLICAN IS LOOKING AT

5
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:15,306
2020 AS A CHANCE TO POSSIBLY

6
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,174
RUN AGAINST HIM.

7
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:17,908
RETIRING ARIZONA SENATOR JEFF

8
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,577
FLAKE SAYING HE IS

9
00:00:19,577 --> 00:00:21,879
CONTEMPLATING ENTERING THE RACE.

10
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,748
ADDING THAT HE HOPES PRESIDENT

11
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:25,449
TRUMP FACES A CHALLENGER OR TWO

12
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,485
IN THE GOP PRIMARIES.

13
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,819
>> NOT IN MY PLANS BUT I HAVE

14
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,588
NOT RULED ANYTHING OUT.

15
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:32,456
I DO HOPE THAT SOMEBODY RUNS ON

16
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:34,592
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OTHER THAN

17
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:35,059
THE PRESIDENT.

18
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:40,431
IF NOTHING ELSE, SIMPLY TO

19
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:41,365
REMIND REPUBLICANS WHAT

20
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:43,634
CONSERVATIVEISM IS AND WHAT

21
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:44,935
STOOD FOR.

22
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:49,173
>> Melissa: LET'S BRING IN OUR

23
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:50,441
PANEL.

24
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:54,812
BRAD BLAKEMAN AND DAVE BROWN.

25
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:56,914
THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR

26
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:57,314
JOINING US.

27
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:59,483
DAVE, LET ME START WITH YOU.

28
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:00,918
WHAT I FIND SOMEWHAT AMUSING

29
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:02,787
ABOUT THIS IS THAT JEFF FLAKE

30
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:04,989
HAS VOTED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

31
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,757
84% OF THE TIME.

32
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:08,492
SO I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW

33
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:09,960
WHAT HE IS OPPOSING.

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,597
>> I THINK IT'S A GREAT POINT.

35
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:14,632
UNDERSCORES THE SENATOR FLAKE

36
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:16,967
HAS BEEN ALL TALK BUT REALLY NO

37
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,570
ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO

38
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,771
OPPOSING THE PRESIDENT.

39
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:22,406
HE STILL IS A SITTING UNITED

40
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:22,873
STATES SENATOR.

41
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:24,275
IF HE WANTED TO GRIND THE

42
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:26,610
SENATE TO A HALT DAY AFTER DAY

43
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,311
TO OPPOSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

44
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,946
AGENDA HE COULD DO THAT.

45
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,681
INSTEAD HE HAS CHOSEN TO

46
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:32,483
SUPPORT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE

47
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,118
OF THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES NO

48
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:35,119
MATTER HOW UNQUALIFIED AND

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,687
FAILED TO STAND UP TO THE

50
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:37,855
PRESIDENT ON IMMIGRATION AND HE

51
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:38,823
GIVES A REALLY GOOD SPEECH BUT

52
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:41,358
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY

53
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:42,526
SENATOR FLAKE NEEDS TO TAKE

54
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:42,860
ACTION.

55
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,395
HE HAS FAILED TO DO THAT.

56
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,197
>> Melissa: BRAD, WHAT I FIND

57
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:47,932
AMUSING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

58
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:50,501
AISLE IS IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS

59
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:54,305
I GUESS CLEVER GAME TO POKE THE

60
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:55,506
BEAR, TO SET OFF AND DO

61
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,808
ANYTHING YOU CAN TO TRY TO EN

62
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,910
FLAME PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HOPE

63
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,078
HE RESPONDS ON TWITTER OR HOPE

64
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:02,713
HE CALLS YOU OUT BY NAME AND

65
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:04,148
USE THAT TO GET YOURSELF

66
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:05,049
ATTENTION.

67
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,684
WE SEE IT FROM POLITICIANS,

68
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:08,085
FROM PEOPLE WRITING BOOKS, WE

69
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,752
SEE IT FROM COMEDIANS.

70
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:12,089
IT SEEMS TO WORK SPECTACULARLY

71
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,023
FOR GETTING YOURSELF ATTENTION.

72
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:14,425
IS THAT KIND OF WHAT JEFF FLAKE

73
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,760
IS DOING HERE DO YOU THINK?

74
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,695
>> ABSOLUTELY.

75
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:19,563
BUT THE PRESIDENT ISN'T TAKING

76
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:20,498
THE BAIT.

77
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:21,432
AS DAVE PROPERLY POINTED OUT,

78
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,300
HOW DO YOU GO AGAINST A

79
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,202
PRESIDENT WHEN YOU VOTED FOR

80
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,738
HIM 84% OF THE TIME?

81
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:29,673
HIS POLICIES YOU SUPPORT.

82
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:32,142
YOUR PLATFORM IS GEE, HE IS NOT

83
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:33,077
A NICE GUY.

84
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,712
NICE GUYS FINISH LAST AND JEFF

85
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,580
FLAKE MAY BE A NICE GUY BUT HE

86
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,482
WON'T GO ANYWHERE AGAINST AN

87
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:39,116
INCUMBENT PRESIDENT LIKE

88
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:39,917
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO HAS A

89
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:41,752
RECORD TO RUN ON.

90
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:44,522
A RECORD THAT SENATOR FLAKE

91
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:44,889
SUPPORTS.

92
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,390
>> Melissa: DAVE, WHO DO YOU

93
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,025
THINK WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE

94
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,426
PERSON TO STAND UP AGAINST

95
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,095
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS YOU PUT IT?

96
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,263
YOU SAY SOMEBODY HAS TO STAND

97
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:52,730
UP AGAINST HIM.

98
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,365
THERE ARE A LOT OF VOTERS THAT

99
00:02:54,365 --> 00:02:56,233
DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE

100
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:56,934
THEY SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.

101
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:58,936
BUT WHO IN YOUR MIND COULD

102
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,704
MOUNT AN EFFECTIVE CHALLENGE?

103
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:03,974
>> SURE, LET ME SAY I SINCERELY

104
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:05,943
HOPE SENATOR FLAKE DOES RUN.

105
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,711
I SUSPECT ALL DEMOCRATS WOULD

106
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,980
BE PLEASED TO SEE A CROWDED

107
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,916
REPUBLICAN FIELD IN 2020.

108
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,219
BUT FOR SOMEONE TO BE EFFECTIVE

109
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:15,920
AT COMPETING WITH THIS

110
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,022
PRESIDENT, YOU CAN SIT BACK AND

111
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,890
SEND A TWEET AND CAPTURE AND

112
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,759
EARN A MEDIA NEWS CYCLE WILL

113
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,997
HAVE TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS

114
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,365
CHARISMATIC AND SELF-FUND.

115
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:29,800
I IMAGINE REPUBLICAN DONORS

116
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,435
WON'T BE SUPER SUPPORTIVE OF A

117
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:32,870
POTENTIAL SPOILER IN THE RACE.

118
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,939
>> Melissa: THERE IS A LOT OF

119
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,373
NEVER TRUMPERS OUT THERE AND

120
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:37,775
THEY RAISED MONEY THAT TIME.

121
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:39,276
DO YOU SEE THAT PERSON, DAVE?

122
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,578
ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT COULD BE

123
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:41,045
EFFECTIVE?

124
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,815
>> AT THIS POINT I KNOW

125
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:45,883
GOVERNOR KASICH EXPRESSED

126
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:46,250
INTEREST.

127
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,252
WE SAW HOW WELL HE DID LAST

128
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:48,552
CYCLE.

129
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:52,222
SENATOR RUBIO IF HE GROWS A

130
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:53,624
BACKBONE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

131
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,059
HIM GO INTO THE RACE.

132
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:57,127
>> Melissa: IS THERE ANYONE TON

133
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:59,730
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT CAN

134
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,599
POSE A THREAT?

135
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,066
>> NO.

136
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:05,135
BECAUSE HE HAS A RECORD.

137
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:06,070
I'M TALKING ABOUT STYLISTICALLY

138
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,938
BUT YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH

139
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:08,272
SUCCESS.

140
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:09,106
IF I WAS ADVISING THE PRESIDENT

141
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:11,742
I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY MANTRA.

142
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:13,978
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH A RECORD.

143
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:15,846
THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, HE

144
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:17,481
IS MAKING INROADS IN FOREIGN

145
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:18,682
POLICY THAT PEOPLE HAVE THROWN

146
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:23,153
THEIR HANDS UP FOR DECADES AND

147
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:28,092
SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IN NORTH

148
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:28,826
KOREA AND IRAN.

149
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:30,427
HE IS HAVING IT WITH GREAT

150
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:31,161
SUCCESS.

151
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:34,932
I DON'T SEE ANY REPUBLICAN

152
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,034
HAVING THE WHEREWITHAL BOTH

153
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:37,735
FINANCIALLY AND IDEOLOGICALLY

154
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,370
TO CHALLENGE THIS PRESIDENT.

155
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,238
>> Melissa: DAVE, I'VE HEARD

156
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:42,506
DEMOCRATS SAY THE EXACT SAME

157
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,107
THING.

158
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,041
THAT'S THEIR CONCERN.

159
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,442
THAT YOU MAY HATE HIS STYLE BUT

160
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:48,212
HE HAS A LOT TO POINT TO IN

161
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:50,814
TERMS OF RESULTS.

162
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:52,716
>> I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY

163
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:53,651
DISAGREE WITH THAT.

164
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:57,154
HE IS VERY GOOD AT BEING

165
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:57,521
BOMBASTIC.

166
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,789
HE ANNOUNCED HASTILY THE NORTH

167
00:04:58,789 --> 00:04:59,723
KOREAN SUMMIT BEFORE HE

168
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:00,891
CANCELED THE SUMMIT.

169
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:02,526
>> Melissa: LOOK WHERE THEY ARE

170
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:02,793
NOW.

171
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:04,161
THAT LOOKS LIKE A SMART MOVE.

172
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:06,296
HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE

173
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:07,231
AND GOT EVERYBODY SNAPPING

174
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:09,566
RIGHT BACK ON HIS TERMS.

175
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,468
>> EVEN A SMART MOVE OR THIS

176
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,337
NEW CYCLE AND SOMETHING ELSE

177
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,038
WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW?

178
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,407
ANYBODY WHO READ THAT BOOK THAT

179
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:17,574
HE HAD GHOST WRITTEN FOR HIM

180
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:21,278
THE ART OF THE DEAL KNOWS HE

181
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,680
THRIVES ON BEING UNPREDICTABLE

182
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,815
AND THROWING HAND GRENADES.

183
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:29,153
>> THAT'S A GOOD THING.

184
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,055
>> WE'RE COMPLETELY ALIENATED

185
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:33,857
FROM OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE ABOUT

186
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:34,158
IRAN.

187
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:35,459
>> IT'S LEADERSHIP.

188
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,295
>> WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY.

189
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,698
>> SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO IT

190
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,966
ALONE STANDING ON PRINCIPLES.

191
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:46,003
>> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH

192
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:46,704
THE DETAILS.

193
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:48,572
YOU KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BUSH,

194
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:50,908
LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA, MUCH MORE

195
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:53,811
METHODICAL AND STRATEGIC IN HOW

196
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,179
THEY ENGAGED.

197
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:56,380
>> CAN'T ARGUE WITH SUCCESS IS

198
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,281
THE POINT.

199
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:58,682
>> Melissa: ISN'T THAT THE

200
00:05:58,682 --> 00:05:58,982
POINT?

201
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:01,518
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY WHO HAVE

202
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:02,519
WALKED THIS ROAD AHEAD OF

203
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,088
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WERE IN THE

204
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:06,724
SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN AND

205
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,859
THEY DID IT THE TRADITIONAL WAY

206
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,961
AND NOW MANY AMERICANS WANT TO

207
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:14,965
SEE SOMEONE JUST TRY SOMETHING

208
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:15,265
ELSE.

209
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,900
THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY.

210
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,302
DOING IT THE SAME WAY OVER AND

211
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,703
OVER AGAIN TO THE SAME BRAD

212
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:20,637
RESULT.

213
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:21,338
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

214
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:22,740
SOMETIMES IT'S A SHAME THAT

215
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,907
YOUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES DON'T

216
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:25,776
SEE IT BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTING

217
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:26,677
IN THEIR OWN SELFISH INTERESTS

218
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,678
AND YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO

219
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,546
COMES IN AND CHANGES THE

220
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:30,013
DYNAMIC.

221
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:31,148
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING

222
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:31,882
SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENTS

223
00:06:31,882 --> 00:06:33,984
SHOULD BE DOING ALL ALONG.

224
00:06:33,984 --> 00:00:00,000
ACTING IN OUR INTEREST FIRST.
