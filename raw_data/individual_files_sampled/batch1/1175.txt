it's double Trump on a relentless quest to corner Iran the US president accuses otech of manipulating oil prices and urges allies to boost production as his really imposing sanctions on Iran he's also threatened country still doing business with the Iranians this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Elizabeth Pradhan oil production prices and politics require a delicate balance Donald Trump is urging oil-producing countries except Iran to boost output he hopes that will keep prices low and motorists happy with cheaper fuel as he tries to force the Iranians out of the market or Trump's pressuring allies to stop buying Iranian oil as a tactic to make her money and leaders negotiate a new nuclear deal after he pulled out of the 2015 agreement two months ago Iran says it will find ways to export its oil at despite Trump we'll get to our guests in just a moment but first Heidi Joe Castro has more from Washington DC president Donald trum increased his pressure on Saudi Arabia by appearing on Fox News and saying that he was a hundred percent sure that OPEC is manipulating the oil market he went on to say that quote they better stop it because we're protecting those countries many of those countries and it is no secret that the country he is referring to there is Saudi Arabia Trump's appearance on Fox News comes on the heels of a tweet he issued yesterday in which he claimed that the king of Saudi Arabia King Salman had promised him during a call or had agreed rather to increase Saudi Arabian oil production by as much as two million barrels a day the White House though quickly backpedal on that assertion following Trump's tweet with a clarifying statement saying that Saudi Arabia had only indicated that it can raise or production if needed further contrasting Trump's claim is Saudi Arabia's statement itself which made no mention of any increase in production amount but the fact that Trump is still increasing the public pressure on Saudi Arabia US ally to increase its oil production is a sign that he will continue with this strongman strategy as Trump feels the pressure from the American voters to lower gas prices at home well Doron is the world's fourth largest proven oil reserves or will export earnings they're a major part of the Iranian economy Iranian leaders say they'll allow private companies to begin exporting to get around US sanctions Iran earned more than fifty billion dollars in all the exports last year that's half its total export revenue 60 percent of Iranian oil the song to Asian countries with China as the number one buyer despite us threats the Chinese say they'll keep on buying Iranian oil but India says it won't it's Iran's second-biggest oil customer European countries by 38% of Iran's oil EU leaders are trying to convince the u.s. to allow their firms to continue trading with Iran without penalties but the Trump administration insists it will not grant waivers well let's bring in our guests now adjoining us from Tehran is Mohammad morandi head of North American Studies graduate program at the University of Tehran from Birmingham in the UK Scott Lucas professor of political science International Studies and American politics at the University of Birmingham and from London is Anjali Ravel oil and gas correspondent for the Financial Times a very warm welcome to all of you miss Robin I'm going to start with you has PEC been artificially manipulating oil prices or does President Trump not understand oil markets well this is what's really funny at the moment because producers came together to cut production over the last year or to stabilize the oil market in fact that's also helped big US shale producers as well so even as Donald Trump has been saying look Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers are manipulating the market is actually also leaning on OPEC now to raise production so he can't really have it both ways mr. Lucas what effect will the president's actions whether it's attacking OPEC asking them to increase production beyond their agreements or imposing sanctions on Iranian oil what is that going to do to oil markets and the prices well there's absolute to level here and I actually think that Trump's call on Saudi Arabia to increase production by 2 million barrels per day it's a bit of grandstanding and it's a bit of distraction from the real story because that second level which is at working-level is that OPEC has agreed to raise production by up to 1 million barrels per day which will of course cover for the pressure on Iranian falling exports caused by the US sanctions so there has been a little bit of de facto cooperation between the Americans and OPEC which is putting pressure on Iran to the point where irani and oil exports could fall by up to 40 percent from 2.5 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels per day in other words that 1 million barrels per day that OPEC is increasing production by in the near future mr. Miranda how is this going to impact Iran increasing production especially given that the US president is saying that he's going to sanction countries and companies that do business with Iran that buy Iranian oil it remains to be seen what sort of impact it has on Iranian oil exports on the one hand Iran is moving to secure its partners countries like China and and even India to make sure that its exports are not hurt very badly and I think it's also in the interest of many of these countries to make sure that they don't put all their eggs in the Saudi basket because Saudi Arabia is not doing very well it is not a very stable country Mohammed bin Salman has been very erratic and his policies and they are not winning a very expensive war in Yemen so those countries who wish to put all their eggs in the Saudi basket could face severe problems if there's any form of instability in the Arabian Peninsula but on the other hand I think the Iranians are also looking for innovative ways to export their oil remember the crippling sanctions that Obama imposed on Iran a few years ago which like Trump he his attempt was to make ordinary Iranians suffer as much as possible that was objective back then Iran was caught off guard more or less it was the first time that sanctions have had ever been imposed on an oil-producing country or on any country for that matter almost and the Iranians initially lost a lot of their exports but gradually over a year they their exports were rising and Obama himself admitted that if the United States had continued to impose those sanctions the sanctions regime would have fallen apart and under Trump is going it's going to be in some ways even more difficult than Obama to keep countries in line because Trump has antagonize so many people mr. Lucas I can see you wanting to come in here I do want to ask you how much pressure you think this is pushing on Iran even if we haven't seen an impact just yet as mr. morandi is saying the Trump administration has imposed a deadline of the fourth of November on oil buyers to cut off purchases from Iran representatives from India and China at going to representatives from the u.s. rather are going to India and China to persuade them to stop completely are these countries going to listen to the u.s. yeah I was smiling because it's very interesting to hear my good friend Mohammed give what is the official Iranian state line that we can survive this there's two issues with that the first is this isn't just a Saudi decision this was a decision by OPEC and it was not only a decision by OPEC it was a decision by OPEC and by Russia a nominal ally of Iran to increase oil production so simply saying it's a choice between Saudi and Iran is that's misleading the second is is that the American pressure combined with internal Iranian problems is already having an effect so two of India's largest refiners one which is owned by the Russians have said they're going to stop taking Iranian oil from November shippers and insurers are already saying we aren't going to move the oil starting in the autumn now the Iranian state line will be we can find a private market we can find private buyers and move this one that's not very easy to do given the sophistication you need to move oil in an international market and to if they start trying to move oil privately it's not only trying to defy the u.s. is trying to defy OPEC miserable just how much pressure is Iran under now we've already spoken about India is not going to buy as much oil if any oil from Iran not sure what China is going to do what about European nations I mean they're even more susceptible aren't there to US sanctions then India and China exactly right if you are a European refiner with any form of the US interests you're going to be watching this situation very very carefully because the last thing you want is even though European governments might be saying look you can carry on your transactions if there are some banking sanctions or any form of secondary sanctions further down the line being imposed on these companies they will be looking at this very very warily so you can see why everyone is operating in a very cautious environment mr. Moran do you what do you make of all of that you know that's certainly painting a very bleak picture for Iran and if all of this pressure is to force Iran to make a new nuclear deal to rethink its what it's doing in the region and Syria in Yemen is it going to have that effect what cards does Iran have now well I would like to first point out that any narrative that runs inconsistent with the American narrative is not you official Iranian than official Iranian narrative and I think that's a bit insulting what is quite clear is that the Iranians are being confronted with an aggressive regime the United States that is trying to cross the country we see people like both Democrats and Republicans both saying so we saw that the m EK terrace organized when they gathered in Paris the other day we saw Nancy Pelosi support them as well as Giuliani and Newt Gingrich and Giuliani admitted that the Nek there are people in Albania they have thousands of people who fought for Saddam Hussein that they are they are trying to create unrest in Iran so the unrest that we've seen that your American guess is alluding to is manufactured from abroad so we do have war being waged on Iran are you saying that keep continuing in Iran that we saw just last week you know the same week that OPEC decided that to increase production have nothing to do with how tough living conditions are for Iranians at the moment that you're saying they're completely manufactured from the outside no I think we should be worried about how you interpret what I'm saying what I'm saying is that as Giuliani said he admitted that these are not spontaneous and the United States has been waging propaganda warfare against Iran for many years now so we have many Persian language channels that are beaming into Iran 24 hours a day funded or owned by Western governments and we have a financial warfare a campaign against the Iranians going on it's been ongoing for decades now when an under Trump is taking it a step further so Giuliani has admitted that it's not spontaneous he has a big mouth and sometimes some things come out which reveal more than he should reveal but the point that I'm trying to make is that the more the the Americans are definitely going to make life more more difficult for Iran ian's but I think that is a sign in itself that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a very stable country which has popular support otherwise what the United States has been trying to do both under Obama and Trump and Bush before them is that they've been trying to make Iranians suffer so much that they will basically overthrow the political order in other words under normal circumstances they know that they cannot do such a thing mr. Lucas let me put the same question I put to mr. morandi to you do you think that the pressure that the very real pressure that we're seeing on Iran at the moment is it going to force it to back to the negotiating table for a new nuclear deal or rethink its participation in regional conflicts no it will not force Iran back to negotiate with the Americans the Trump administration doesn't want to negotiate it will not immediately change Iran's policy in the region but that's because we have two competing competing false narratives that are both using sanctions the u.s. false narrative which is the Trump administration one is we are going to change the regime in Iran and Mohammed Ronde is absolutely right that is the Trump administration's goal but the false narrative from the Iranian hardliners site is is to use the sanctions to tell Iranian people all these economic problems you have all these social issues you have all these concerns about the environment that you have that you've had for years it's all created by the foreign enemies it's all created by the Americans or the British or Persian language channels and of course it's not it's actually Iranian people who have these concerns so you've got the Iranian people who don't necessarily want the overthrow the system but they want an accountable system that addresses their concerns being caught in between Washington and the Islamic Republic's elites at this point mister Bava let me bring you in now because I do want to talk more about Trump's motives for his actions and what he's been saying towards OPEC because they're not just about squeezing Iran but also about keeping oil prices low as those midterm elections approached in November how much you know is that a factor I think it's a really big factor particularly at the moment we're going into the big US holiday driving season in the summer months so there's always one eye on domestic fuel prices he's trying to ensure that OPEC is listening in making sure they ramped up oil production and you know as halodule folly the Saudi energy minister said when we were all in Vienna look we have to pay attention to Trump's tweets because he's reflecting the concerns of the average US consumer just as politicians from India and elsewhere have been calling the Saudis to to say look you better figure this out you've got oil prices rising towards $80 that's benchmark Brent crude so the domestic fuel prices are really really important here and mr. Lucas domestic fuel prices actually cost Trump politically cost him Republican support would they connect his policies to higher prices I think if the economy continues to ride the wave which really started in the last year's of the Obama administration and has been artificially boosted by the tax cut which is a huge gamble but I think if the Trump administration can ride that through November a rise in gas prices especially once we get into the autumn isn't going to make a huge difference but if the American economy starts to sag if there are other issues such as the Russia investigation that complicate this then of course any issue becomes one in which the Trump administration could become vulnerable and mr. Miranda the American economy is doing well the Iranian economy isn't again what are its plans now as production Rises as it faces sanctions to get around all of this well first I'd like to point something out and that is that it's really it helpful to people like Trump when caricatures of Iran are created by people in the West and Iran is a country you can't become an expert on Iran without knowing at least the language you can't go to a Persian restaurant and become an Iranian expert Iran is a complicated society and there are many checks and balances in Iran and there are many political parties fighting it out as we speak over accountability and government corruption just as the current administration was doing the same with the previous administration we have a very sophisticated country with popular votes with elections with all of our the directed elected directly and indirectly by the people and as I said earlier the very fact that the Americans are trying to strangle Iran both under this regime the Trump regime in previous regimes is I think a sign of Iran's inherent strength but I think what the Iranians are going to do is that they are going to try to rely more on local production and I think the administration is going to move away from liberal liberal economics and move towards creating a larger map for a larger net for those who are vulnerable and I think that also the the fall of the Iranian rial although it was very hurtful I think in the long run it was inevitable because they are all of our administration's both past and present they have always made the mistake of artificially propping up the rial and that has always hurt local industries and they've always done it for political reasons because of what Trump did the rial has collapsed and in a sense they it's Trump helped the government because it would have collapsed at some point and people would have blamed the administration but now at least Trump gets part of the blame so I think it's going to make Iranian Goods more competitive the Iranians more capable in exporting it's going to be difficult yeah there's no doubt about that but I think after initial difficulty the Iranian oil exports will gradually increase they will regain most of their market but they will have to sell their oil and a discount and increasingly I think the Iranians are going to be selling more oil to China in you on because Iran's most important trading partner is China so therefore I don't see that the United States will have any success in any way or form and as I think if we look at accountability over the past few years and decades what Americans have been saying about Iran being weak despotic about to collapse none of those have been turned out to be clear on this show again we'll see that Iran will be around I would like to go to mr. Lucas now because I can see that you completely disagree again with what mr. Moran is saying in the very positive prospects for Iran I actually agree this is a really serious issue for Iranians and it is very important to pay respect to the people there but what you've just heard was sort of an economic mishmash and sort of like all's going to be okay which is pretty much the line of the Supreme Leader just trust in the resistance economy this isn't a question of taking a political point of view it's a facing reality that is yes that the Iranian economy the Iranian economy whose currency has dropped 85 percent the Iranian economy which has had severe problems with corruption and mismanagement that the rouhani government's ability to deal with those economic issues is now boxed in by a very aggressive Trump administration and by hardliners in Iran including those around the supreme leader who really are using this to sort of push Iranian people to the edge of this mr. Newton days ago military advisor what should Iranian leaders do then yeah I mean the the Iranian leaders of the Iranian government's approach the rouhani government was to reach out to the European Union in particular to reach out to Europeans to offset the American pressure and that is to try to maintain trade and investment and they were having some limited success with that but it's a very long road to hoe what's happened in the last two weeks is that the combination of the very aggressive Trump administration and of hardline pressure on the rouhani government is closing off that option of trying to balance the Americans not only with China not only with India but with the Europeans and I really think we are getting to the point we are not talking about while they're trying to blame the Iranians for seconds the reality on the ground then the Iranians are willing to negotiate other issues have the decency to be at least honest about hang on no I didn't say listen I think you've missed I think you miss my point Mohamed I think you missed my point what I was saying is is that far from trying to blame anyone that the rouhani government was trying to save the nuclear deal and therefore save the Iranian economy from its perspective by going to other countries and trying to isolate the United States the problem is is that the Iranian position which is we can just use a resistance economy we don't need necessarily to work with the Europeans we don't need necessarily to try to take this option let's just be tough all right risking isolating the rouhani government yeah rather than Washington we don't we have about a minute left in the program and I would like to give miss Ravel the last word on this where our oil markets oil prices going and as Donald Trump going to succeed in both punishing Iran and keeping prices low it's a really hard task Saudi Arabia which holds like the largest amount of spare production capacity which is two million barrels a day has traditionally never gone that far because it knows that it needs the extra supply buffer if there are any major outages elsewhere in the world so it really has been reluctant to do that in the past and let's note that Saudi officials have not actually agreed publicly to raise production by two million barrels a day let's also remember that if it does increase rapidly in fact that's actually quite a bullish factor for the market because you're saying to the world that if there is another outage in Libya or Venezuela you might not be able to meet it all right miss revel thank you very much for their unfortunately we run out of time but thank you to all of our guests Mohammad Miranda impaired and Scott Lucas in Birmingham and Angela Ravel in London and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website al-jazeera calm and for further discussion do go to our Facebook page that's Facebook calm /aj side-story you can also join the conversation on twitter i handle this at aj inside story from the Elizabeth puranam and the whole team here bye for now
