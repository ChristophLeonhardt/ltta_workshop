1
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:11,201
>> Bret: WELCOME BACK TO

2
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:11,701
"SPECIAL REPORT."

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,076
JOINING ME LIVE IN STUDIO

4
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:13,954
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES

5
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:16,608
COMEY A LITTLE TOUGHER TO

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,107
MOTORCADE.

7
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:18,757
>> TOUGH FOR EVERYBODY

8
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:19,152
TODAY.

9
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:19,757
>> Bret: I UNDERSTAND YOU

10
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:20,354
HAVE A NEW BOOK OUT.

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,009
>> I HAVE HEARD THAT YEAH.

12
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:22,656
>> Bret: THANKS FOR BEING

13
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:22,956
HERE.

14
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,263
THE BOOK IS "HIGHER LOYALTY,

15
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:26,968
TRUTH, LIES AND LEADERSHIP."

16
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:28,368
BIG SALES IN ITS FIRST WEEK.

17
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:29,219
I HAVE READ THE BOOK.

18
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:30,770
I HAVE SEEN OR READ EVERY

19
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,471
INTERVIEW THAT YOU HAVE DONE

20
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,348
ON THIS MEDIA TOUR.

21
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,667
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FOCUSED

22
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,569
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND YOUR

23
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:35,976
INTERACTIONS.

24
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:37,276
I WANT TO GET TO THAT BUT I

25
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:39,877
WANT TO START

26
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:40,580
CHRONOLOGICALLY WITH HILLARY

27
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,475
CLINTON EMAIL PROBE AND THE

28
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,676
DECISIONS YOU MADE.

29
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,985
THERE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU

30
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,396
AND YOUR FBI COLLEAGUES MADE

31
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:47,686
THE DECISION TO EXONERATE

32
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:48,512
SECRETARY CLINTON WELL

33
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:49,790
BEFORE SHE WAS INTERVIEWED.

34
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,268
>> NO.

35
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:53,987
>> Bret: SO WHY WAIT UNTIL

36
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,189
THE END AND WHY WRITE UP THE

37
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,592
MEMO THAT YOU EVENTUALLY

38
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,149
BRING FORWARD FIRST?

39
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,900
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

40
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,324
COME MAY, AFTER WE HAD BEEN

41
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:06,206
DOING IT FOR ABOUT 10

42
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,907
PART OF MY REGULAR BRIEFING

43
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:08,709
FROM THE INVESTIGATORS, SEE

44
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,704
THAT THEIR VIEW WAS IT WAS

45
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,606
UNLIKELY TO END IN A CASE

46
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,608
THAT THE PROSECUTORS AT DOJ

47
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,364
WOULD BRING.

48
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:15,909
>> Bret: BEFORE THE

49
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,267
INTERVIEW.

50
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:16,664
>> SURE.

51
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:18,011
BECAUSE THEY HAD SPENT 10

52
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,068
MONTHS DIGGING AROUND,

53
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:21,214
READING ALL HER EMAILS,

54
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,371
PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

55
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:23,072
INTERVIEWING EVERYBODY WHO

56
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:24,125
SET UP HER SYSTEM.

57
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,497
THEY WEREN'T CERTAIN OF THIS

58
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:25,819
RESULT.

59
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,120
THEY SAID LOOK, BOSS ON THE

60
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,178
CURRENT COURSE AND SPEED IT

61
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:29,828
LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO

62
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:30,908
GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE

63
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:31,825
PROSECUTORS WILL BRING IT IN

64
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,126
MAY I START THINKING OKAY,

65
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,428
IF IT CONTINUES THAT WAY AND

66
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,735
IT MAY NOT, IF IT CONTINUES

67
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:36,838
THAT WAY HOW DO WE END THIS

68
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:38,764
THING IN A CREDIBLE WAY.

69
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:39,765
>> Bret: WHAT, IF ANYTHING,

70
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:40,834
COULD SHE HAVE SAID IN THAT

71
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,635
INTERVIEW THAT WOULD HAVE

72
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,641
CHANGED YOUR MIND AND

73
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:43,613
SOMEHOW CHANGED WHAT YOU

74
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:44,443
EVENTUALLY DECIDED TO DO?

75
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:48,041
>> WELL, TWO WAYS.

76
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,249
FIRST, BY LYING IN A WAY WE

77
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:50,343
COULD PROVE IN THE INTERVIEW

78
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,500
OR GIVING US A HOOK TO

79
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,145
CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION

80
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,702
TO SEE IF WE COULD PROVE A

81
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:54,548
LIE OR ADMITTING SOMETHING

82
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,949
THAT WOULD SURPRISE US ABOUT

83
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,876
HER INTENT.

84
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,058
NOW, A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE

85
00:01:58,058 --> 00:01:59,130
ASKED GOOD QUESTION ABOUT

86
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,009
WHY TO DO THE INTERVIEW AT

87
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:00,710
THE END.

88
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,255
THAT'S FAIRLY TYPICAL FOR A

89
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,561
SUBJECT INTERVIEW IN A WHITE

90
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:04,264
COLLAR INVESTIGATION.

91
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:06,267
I THINK YOU SEE SPECIAL

92
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,116
COUNSEL MUELLER TAKING

93
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:08,261
EXACTLY THAT APPROACH WITH

94
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,463
THE PRESIDENT.

95
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,067
>> Bret: YOU ALREADY KNEW

96
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:13,010
THAT SHE HAD BEEN TELLING,

97
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,527
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY,

98
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,027
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT -- AND

99
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:19,327
HOW SHE HANDLED THOSE

100
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:19,673
EMAILS.

101
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,175
TAKE A LISTEN.

102
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,184
>> SECRETARY CLINTON SAID

103
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,400
THERE WAS NOTHING MARKED

104
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,684
CLASSIFIED ON HER EMAILS

105
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:26,854
EITHER SENT OR RECEIVED.

106
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:27,438
WAS THAT TRUE?

107
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,103
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

108
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,183
>> SECRETARY CLINTON SAID I

109
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,608
DID NOT EMAIL ANY CLASSIFIED

110
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:32,994
MATERIAL TO ANYONE ON MY

111
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:33,315
EMAIL.

112
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:34,564
THERE IS NO CLASSIFIED

113
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:34,894
MATERIAL.

114
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:35,445
WAS THAT TRUE?

115
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:36,799
>> THERE WAS CLASSIFIED

116
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:37,650
MATERIAL EMAILED.

117
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,148
>> SECRETARY CLINTON SAID

118
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:40,994
ALL WORK-RELATED EMAILS WERE

119
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,871
RETURNED TO THE STATE

120
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:42,250
DEPARTMENT.

121
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,722
WAS THAT TRUE?

122
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:43,253
>> NO.

123
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:45,226
WE FOUND WORK-RELATED

124
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:46,007
EMAILS, THOUSANDS THAT WERE

125
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,400
NOT RETURNED.

126
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,257
>> Bret: SO IT WENT ON.

127
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:49,456
THERE WERE CLEARLY A PATTERN

128
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:49,760
THERE.

129
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,704
AND HAD YOU ALREADY MADE

130
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:51,511
YOUR DECISION.

131
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,433
>> NO.

132
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,011
I HAD NOT MADE MY DECISION,

133
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,364
BUT I COULD SEE WHAT THE

134
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:56,565
INVESTIGATORS SAW AFTER 10

135
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:56,910
MONTHS.

136
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,567
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GENERAL

137
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:58,612
SENSE OF WHERE YOU ARE

138
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,620
HEADED AFTER 10 MONTHS OF

139
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,190
THAT KIND OF WORK, YOU ARE

140
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,072
NOT COMPETENT.

141
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,824
THEY COULD SEE IT WAS

142
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:04,918
UNLIKELY, ALTHOUGH NOT

143
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,826
CERTAIN, UNLIKELY TO GET US

144
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:06,920
TO A PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD

145
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,230
PROSECUTE IT AT THE JUSTICE

146
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,629
DEPARTMENT.

147
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:09,730
AND THE QUESTION WAS WOULD

148
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,632
SHE LIE TO US?

149
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:14,434
WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN THE

150
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,529
YOU KNOW, IN A POLITICAL

151
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,530
CAMPAIGN IS NOT OUR

152
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:16,911
BUSINESS.

153
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:17,688
OUR BUSINESS IS ARE YOU

154
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:18,836
GOING TO LIE TO US AND IF

155
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:20,433
YOU ARE AND WE CAN PROVE IT,

156
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,635
THEN WE ARE GOING TO

157
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,091
PROSECUTE YOU FOR IT.

158
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:23,793
>> Bret: DID YOU GO BACK TO

159
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:24,459
INTENT A LOT.

160
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,395
ACTUALLY THE STATUTE AS IT'S

161
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:27,941
WRITTEN HANDLING CLASSIFIED

162
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,748
INFORMATION GROSSLY

163
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:29,648
NEGLIGENT DOESN'T DEAL WIN

164
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:29,950
TENT.

165
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,146
>> GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IS

166
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,447
EXPRESS PRESSURE OF KIND OF

167
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:34,752
INTENT.

168
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:35,955
HOW WERE YOU ACTING WHAT WAS

169
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,005
YOUR MENTAL STATE AT THE

170
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:37,357
TIME.

171
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:38,108
>> Bret: YOU WERE CAREFUL TO

172
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,874
CALL IT EXTREMELY CARELESS

173
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:40,763
NOT GROSSLY NEGLIGENT.

174
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:41,261
>> RIGHT.

175
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,255
I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE

176
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,513
FACT WE THOUGHT IT WAS NOT

177
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:45,383
MERE SLOPPINESS BUT DIDN'T

178
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:47,260
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF

179
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,134
CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT THAT THE

180
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:48,718
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

181
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:49,140
PROSECUTES.

182
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,886
HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THAT?

183
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:51,865
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SAID

184
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:52,365
REALLY SLOPPY.

185
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,767
I WANTED TO BE HONEST AND

186
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,068
SAY IT'S ABOVE SLOPPY.

187
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,427
IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO THE

188
00:03:57,427 --> 00:03:58,371
WHAT 1917 STATUTE MEANT WHEN

189
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,028
IT SAID GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IS

190
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:01,474
A FELONY.

191
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,284
>> Bret: WHY DID YOU ALLOW

192
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,877
CHERYL MILLS, SECRETARY

193
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,578
CLINTON'S CHIEF OF STAFF, TO

194
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,979
SIT IN ON THAT INTERVIEW?

195
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,480
SHE WAS POTENTIAL ITLY A

196
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,590
SUBJECT OR TARGET IN THE

197
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,033
INVESTIGATION.

198
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,138
SHE WAS A GOVERNMENT

199
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:10,492
EMPLOYEE.

200
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,742
SHE WASN'T CLINTON'S

201
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:12,087
ATTORNEY.

202
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,292
BUT, YET, SHE SITS IN THERE

203
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:14,192
AND TALKS WITH HER

204
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:15,093
THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW.

205
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,690
>> YEAH.

206
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,947
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS AT THAT

207
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:19,449
TIME SHE WAS ONE OF

208
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:20,093
CLINTON'S ATTORNEYS.

209
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,450
SHE WAS NO LONGER A SUBJECT

210
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,395
IN OUR INVESTIGATION.

211
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,901
THE AGENTS HAD SCRUBBED HER

212
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,553
CONDUCT VERY CAREFULLY BY

213
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,158
THAT POINT AND SHE WAS NO

214
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:27,956
LONGER A SUBJECT.

215
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:28,875
THAT, AGAIN, THAT'S A

216
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,760
REASONABLE QUESTION.

217
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,059
BUT THE FACTS ARE NOT A

218
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:31,404
SUBJECT.

219
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,906
ONE OF CLINTON'S LAWYERS.

220
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,108
SHE IS ENTITLED TO BE IN THE

221
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:35,512
INTERVIEW.

222
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:36,810
>> Bret: WE ASKED PEOPLE TO

223
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,615
TWEET IN OR WRITE IN.

224
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:39,663
WE HAVE ONE FROM JAY HARPER

225
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,346
WILSON I'M A RETIRED FBI

226
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,716
AGENT SERVING ALMOST 25

227
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,417
YEARS RETIRING IN 1995 AS

228
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,719
SENIOR EQUITIESIVE SPECIAL

229
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,670
AGENT PLEASE ASK THURSDAY

230
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,721
WHY A GRAND JURY WAS NOT

231
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,854
USED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON

232
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:50,374
INVESTIGATION AS WOULD BE

233
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,857
NORMAL AND WHY WAS IT RUN

234
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:52,926
OUT OF H.Q.?

235
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,233
BOOK DID NOT ADDRESS.

236
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,028
>> YEAH.

237
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:55,985
SECOND ONE I WILL TAKE

238
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:56,487
FIRST.

239
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:58,536
IT WAS RUN OUT OF HQ BECAUSE

240
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:01,743
IT WAS A CASE OF INTENSE

241
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:02,135
INTEREST.

242
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,462
OUTSIDE TO THE MEDIA, AND SO

243
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,643
TO KEEP IT TIGHT, IT WAS

244
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:06,239
WORKED IN THE COUNTER

245
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,247
INTELLIGENCE DIVISION AT

246
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:07,715
HEADQUARTERS.

247
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:08,716
YOU CAN REASONABLY DISAGREE

248
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,143
WITH THAT IF YOU ARE AN FBI

249
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,448
PERSON.

250
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,645
COULD HAVE PUT IT IN

251
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,801
WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE.

252
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,901
COULD HAVE PUT IT IN NEW

253
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,224
YORK.

254
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:14,948
THE DECISION THAT COUNTER

255
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:15,977
INTENTION MADE IT WILL BE

256
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:18,009
KEPT TIGHTER AND LEAK-PROOF

257
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,982
WHICH IT WAS CRIMINAL

258
00:05:20,982 --> 00:05:21,912
INTELLIGENCE DIVISION.

259
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:22,513
>> Bret: NO GRAND JURY.

260
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,513
>> I'M NOT ALLOWED TO

261
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:24,814
COMMENT ON THE WAY IN WHICH

262
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,914
THE GRAND JURY WAS USED.

263
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,517
I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH SHE

264
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:28,486
WAS NOT INTERVIEWED IN FRONT

265
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:29,763
OF A GRAND JURY WHICH IS

266
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,118
ANOTHER JUDGMENT CALL THAT

267
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:31,671
PROSECUTORS AND

268
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,798
INVESTIGATORS MAKE ALL THE

269
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:33,166
TIME.

270
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,052
>> Bret: YOU THOUGHT THAT

271
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:34,622
ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA

272
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:35,575
LYNCH WAS COMPROMISED THAT

273
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:36,375
YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING

274
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,226
DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THAT

275
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:38,371
TARMAC MEETING WITH FORMER

276
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:38,943
PRESIDENT CLINTON AND

277
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,930
BECAUSE SHE HAD WANTED TO

278
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,374
CALL IT A MATTER, CORRECT?

279
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,982
>> AND OTHER THINGS.

280
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:43,777
>> Bret: AND OTHER THINGS IN

281
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:44,678
THIS CLASSIFIED THING THAT

282
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,578
ENDS UP LEAKING TO THE "NEW

283
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:45,979
YORK TIMES."

284
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:46,479
SHE DENIES.

285
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,181
THIS SHE WRITES:  IF HE HAD

286
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,684
ANY CONCERNS REGARDING EMAIL

287
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,385
INVESTIGATION, CLASSIFIED OR

288
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:51,119
NOT, HE HAD AMPLE

289
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,039
OPPORTUNITIES TO RAISE THEM

290
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:53,437
WITH ME BOTH PRIVATELY AND

291
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,087
IN MEETINGS.

292
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:54,855
HE NEVER DID.

293
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,889
SO, SOMEONE IS NOT TELLING

294
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:56,621
THE TRUTH HERE.

295
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:57,490
IS IT THE FORMER ATTORNEY

296
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,499
GENERAL OR YOU?

297
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,292
>> NO.

298
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,221
ACTUALLY, I THINK WE ARE

299
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:01,194
BOTH TELLING THE TRUTH.

300
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,096
I NEVER WENT TO HER AND SAID

301
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,397
LORETTA, I THINK YOU SHOULD

302
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:04,972
RECUSE YOURSELF.

303
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:06,154
MY PROBLEM WAS SHE HAD

304
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:07,758
ALREADY ANNOUNCED IT

305
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,103
AND THAT SHE WOULD ACCEPT MY

306
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:10,610
RECOMMENDATION.

307
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,805
AND SO AT THAT POINT WHAT DO

308
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,263
I DO?

309
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:13,362
AND I DECIDED AT THAT POINT

310
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:16,165
I HAVE GOT TO STEP AWAY FROM

311
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:16,710
HER.

312
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,415
>> Bret: FAST FORWARD A LOT

313
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:18,619
OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET HOW IT

314
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:19,818
COMES OUT AND HOW YOU TAKE

315
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:20,167
CONTROL.

316
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:23,116
IT LEADS TO ROD ROSENSTEIN.

317
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,023
HE CITES THIS IN WHAT YOU

318
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,974
DID AS A REASON FOR

319
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:26,619
RECOMMENDING YOUR FIRING.

320
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,620
DID YOU GO ON AFTER THAT

321
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,227
RECOMMENDATION YOU WRITE A

322
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,377
LETTER TO CONGRESS TO

323
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:30,824
ANNOUNCE THE CASE WE OPENED

324
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,679
BECAUSE MORE CLASSIFIED

325
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,981
EMAILS HAD BEEN FOUND ON

326
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:34,127
ANTHONY WEINER'S COMPUTER.

327
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,482
YOU SAID IT WAS, LAST NIGHT,

328
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,034
A TOUGH CHOICE BETWEEN

329
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:37,734
CONCEALING OR COMING

330
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:38,938
FORWARD, A REALLY TOUGH

331
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:39,288
CHOICE.

332
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,433
BUT THERE ARE AUTHORITIES IN

333
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,836
NEW YORK WHO ARE SAYING FBI

334
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,738
HQ WAS SLOW-WALKING THAT

335
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,049
CASE AND WEEKS WENT BY

336
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:46,696
WITHOUT ANY ACTION.

337
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:48,173
DID YOU KNOW THAT ANDREW

338
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:49,916
MCCABE, YOUR DEPUTY, HAD SAT

339
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,600
ON THAT REVELATION ABOUT THE

340
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:51,945
EMAILS?

341
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,101
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THAT.

342
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,005
I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE THE

343
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:55,306
CASE.

344
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:57,256
I DO KNOW THAT NEW YORK AND

345
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:58,175
FBI HEADQUARTERS BECAME

346
00:06:58,175 --> 00:06:59,758
AWARE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME

347
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:00,709
CONNECTION BETWEEN WEINER'S

348
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,856
LAPTOP AND THE CLINTON

349
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:03,512
INVESTIGATION WEEKS BEFORE

350
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:05,466
IT WAS BROUGHT TO ME FOR A

351
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:05,859
DECISION.

352
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,765
AS I WRITE IN THE BOOK, I

353
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:07,666
DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY

354
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,862
COULD HAVE MOVED FASTER AND

355
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,367
WHY THE DELAY.

356
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:11,064
>> Bret: WAS IT THE THREAT

357
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,020
THAT THE NEW YORK AGENTS

358
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,666
WERE GOING TO LEAK THAT IT

359
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,475
EXISTED REALLY WHAT DROVE

360
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,169
YOU TO THE NOT CONCEAL PART.

361
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:16,877
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

362
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:18,026
I THINK ACTUALLY WHAT DROVE

363
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:19,773
IT WAS THE PROSECUTORS IN

364
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,730
NEW YORK WHO WERE WORKING

365
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,075
THE CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST

366
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,376
WEINER CALLED DOWN TO

367
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,534
HEADQUARTERS AND SAID ARE WE

368
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:25,487
GETTING A SEARCH WARRANT OR

369
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,235
NOT FOR THIS?

370
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,436
THAT CAUSED -- I'M SORRY

371
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:28,982
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

372
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,883
HEADQUARTERS TO THEN CALL

373
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,091
ACROSS THE STREET TO THE FBI

374
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,541
AND POKE THE ORGANIZATION

375
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,942
AND THEY STARTED TO MOVE

376
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,146
MUCH MORE QUICKLY.

377
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:36,689
I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WAS,

378
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,091
IF THERE WAS SLOW ACTIVITY

379
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,893
WHY IT WAS SLOW FOR THOSE

380
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,050
FIRST COUPLE WEEKS.

381
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,995
>> Bret: I WANT IT MOVE ONTO

382
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:42,851
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

383
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:44,602
WE ARE TOLD AFTER THIS

384
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:45,298
AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMAT REPORTS

385
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,658

386
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:47,304
PAPADOPOULOS, TALKING ABOUT

387
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:49,553
PLANS TO GET RUSSIA INFO OR

388
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,457
EMAILS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON

389
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:51,304
THAT THE FBI IS NOTIFIED

390
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,205
THROUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT

391
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,062
ABOUT THIS IN EARLY MAY,

392
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:54,371
TRUE?

393
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,965
>> NO.

394
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:56,709
>> Bret: WHEN WERE THEY

395
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,067
NOTIFIED.

396
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,116
>> FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT

397
00:07:58,116 --> 00:07:58,918
CONFIRMING WHAT THE SOURCE

398
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:00,068
WAS FROM IT.

399
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:01,571
THE FBI LEARNED THE

400
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:02,071
INFORMATION ABOUT

401
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,572
PAPADOPOULOS IN LATE JULY

402
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:04,975
AND OPENED A COUNTER

403
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:05,618
INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION

404
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,719
AT THAT POINT.

405
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,528
THE MEETING THAT YOU ARE

406
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,179
TALKING ABOUT OCCURRED IN

407
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,055
THE SPRING.

408
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:11,524
>> Bret: APRIL.

409
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,826
>> BEFORE THERE WERE ANY

410
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,134
PUBLIC REVELATION OF RUSSIAN

411
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:14,809
HACKED EMAILS.

412
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:15,829
BUT THE FBI DIDN'T LEARN

413
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,987
ABOUT IT IN LATE JULY.

414
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:18,438
>> Bret: OKAY.

415
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:19,732
SO WHAT IS THE CRIME OR THE

416
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,692
COLLUSION THAT LAUNCHES THE

417
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:22,135
INVESTIGATION?

418
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,344
>> COLLUSION IS NOT A WORD

419
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:24,838
THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH.

420
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,744
>> Bret: WHAT IS THE CRIME?

421
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:26,695
WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE

422
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:27,496
BASICALLY THAT LAUNCHES?

423
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:28,842
>> THE QUESTION IS YOU OPEN

424
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,748
A COUNTER INTELLIGENCE

425
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:30,500
INVESTIGATION TO UNDERSTAND

426
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,847
ARE ANY AMERICANS IN CAHOOTS

427
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,679
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES OF

428
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,306
AN ADVERSARY NATION.

429
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,307
>> Bret: WHEN THE STEELE

430
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:39,857
DOSSIER COMES OUT, SOME TIME

431
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:41,254
EARLY JULY, WHEN DID YOU

432
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,211
PERSONALLY LEARN ABOUT THE

433
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,712
MEMOS AND THE DOSSIER?

434
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,258
>> SOME TIME IN THE FALL.

435
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,059
I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY

436
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,460
WHEN.

437
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,620
>> Bret: YOU ARE TALKING

438
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:48,962
FALL --

439
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,321
>> -- I'M SORRY, FALL OF

440
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:51,965
'16.

441
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:52,443
>> Bret: RIGHT.

442
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,466
WHO SO WHO TELLING YOU ABOUT

443
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:53,766
THEM.

444
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,273
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

445
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:55,944
SOMEONE ON MY SENIOR STAFF.

446
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:56,626
>> Bret: DO YOU REMEMBER HOW

447
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,197
THEY WERE DESCRIBED.

448
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:58,198
>> I REMEMBER THEY BRIEFED

449
00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,227
ME ABOUT IT EXPLAINED THEY

450
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:01,280
CAME FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE.

451
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,132
FORMER ALLIED INTELLIGENCE

452
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:02,475
OFFICER.

453
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,499
I REMEMBER BEING GIVEN A

454
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:04,500
COPY OF IT I DON'T KNOW

455
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,887
WHETHER IT WAS SEPTEMBER,

456
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:06,231
OCTOBER.

457
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:07,484
SOME TIME IN THAT PERIOD OF

458
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:07,915
TIME.

459
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:08,581
>> Bret: WHEN DID YOU LEARN

460
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,237
THAT THE DNC AND HILLARY

461
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,383
CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAD FUNDED

462
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,061
CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S WORK?

463
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:12,585
>> I STILL DON'T KNOW THAT

464
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,942
FOR A FACT.

465
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:14,587
>> Bret: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

466
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,394
>> I HAVE ONLY SEEN IT IN

467
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:16,197
THE MEDIA.

468
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:17,490
I NEVER KNEW EXACTLY WHICH

469
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,448
DEMOCRATS HAD FUNDED.

470
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:19,849
I KNEW IT WAS FUNDED FIRST

471
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:21,452
BY REPUBLICANS.

472
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:22,195
>> Bret: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

473
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,650
>> I'M SORRY?

474
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,297
>> Bret: THAT'S NOT TRUE

475
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,203
THAT THE DOSSIER THAT

476
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:26,304
CHRISTOPHER STEELE WORKED ON

477
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,305
WAS FUNDED BY REPUBLICANS?

478
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,960
>> MY UNDERSTANDING HIS WORK

479
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,596
STARTED FUNDED AS OPO

480
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:34,607
RESEARCH FUNDED BY

481
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,087
REPUBLICANS.

482
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,080
>> Bret: SO FREE BEACON SAID

483
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,014
THAT THEY HAD GLENN SIMPSON

484
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,270
AND FUSION GPS ON A RETAINER

485
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,644
THEY DID NOT FUND THE

486
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:44,424
CHRISTOPHER STEELE MEMO OR

487
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,393
THE DOSSIER.

488
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:46,642
THAT WAS INITIATED BY

489
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,147
DEMOCRATS.

490
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:47,820
>> OKAY.

491
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,899
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THE

492
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,730
ACTIVITY WAS BEGUN, THAT

493
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,926
STEELE WAS HIRED TO LOOK

494
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,727
INTO FIRST FUNDED BY

495
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,128
REPUBLICANS.

496
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,229
THEN PICKED UP -- IMPORTANT

497
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,830
THING WAS PICKED UP BY

498
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,987
DEMOCRATS OPPOSED TO DONALD

499
00:09:58,987 --> 00:09:59,732
TRUMP.

500
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,591
>> Bret: SO IS THAT WHY --

501
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:01,834
DID YOU TELL PRESIDENT OBAMA

502
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,894
THAT THE DOSSIER WAS WHO IT

503
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,437
WAS FUNDED BY?

504
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,896
>> NO, NOT TO MY

505
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:07,340
RECOLLECTION.

506
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,241
>> DID HE WANT TO KNOW WHO

507
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:08,947
IT WAS FUNDED BY.

508
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:10,700
>> I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT I

509
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,225
KNEW WHICH IT WAS FUNDED BY

510
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,301
PEOPLE POLITICALLY OPPOSED

511
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,356
BY DONALD TRUMP.

512
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:16,356
WHICH PARTICULAR OPPONENTS

513
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:18,175
WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

514
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:18,851
>> Bret: YOU STILL TO THIS

515
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,053
DAY DON'T KNOW IT WAS FUNDED

516
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:20,461
BY THE DNC.

517
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,065
>> I HAVE READ THAT IN THE

518
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:23,056
MEDIA BUT DIDN'T KNOW FOR A

519
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,715
FACT AND DIDN'T KNOW WHILE I

520
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:27,615
WAS AT THE FBI WHICH EXACT

521
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:28,661
OPPONENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S

522
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,562
FUNDED THAT.

523
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,219
>> Bret: HOW MANY TIMES AND

524
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:31,519
TO WHAT EXTENT DID YOU BRIEF

525
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,465
PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE

526
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:32,772
DOSSIER?

527
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:33,866
>> I DIDN'T EVER BRIEF

528
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,824
PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE

529
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:35,168
DOSSIER.

530
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,579
I WAS PRESENT DURING A

531
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:38,579
CONVERSATION WHERE DIRECTOR

532
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:39,378
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

533
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:40,731
BRIEFED IT TO HIM AS WE DID

534
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,875
TO THE GANG OF EIGHT AND TO

535
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,530
THE PRESIDENT-ELECT THE

536
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,478
FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY.

537
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,587
>> Bret: YOU CALLED THE

538
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:47,738
DOSSIER UNVERIFIED,

539
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:48,085
SALACIOUS.

540
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,335
WHY DID YOU USE THAT TO THE

541
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,891
FISA COURT TO ASK FOR

542
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,285
SURVEILLANCE FOR CARTER

543
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:52,585
PAGE?

544
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,587
NOT ONLY USE IT BUT YOU LED

545
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,489
WITH IT A BULK OF THAT FISA

546
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,091
APPLICATION DEALS WITH THAT

547
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:58,665
DOSSIER.

548
00:10:58,665 --> 00:10:58,915
WHY?

549
00:10:58,915 --> 00:10:59,492
>> YEAH.

550
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,850
THAT'S NOT MY RECOLLECTION.

551
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,194
BRET.

552
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,501
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE

553
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,197
FISA APPLICATION HAS BEEN

554
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:04,552
RELEASED.

555
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:06,306
MY RECOLLECTION WAS IT WAS

556
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,006
PART OF A BROADER MOSAIC OF

557
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,458
FACTS THAT WERE LAID BEFORE

558
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,179
THE FISA JUDGE TO OBTAIN A

559
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,409
FISA WARRANT.

560
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:13,262
>> Bret: IT WAS A LOT MORE

561
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:14,707
THAN THE DOSSIER IN THE FISA

562
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,108
APPLICATION.

563
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,209
>> MY RECOLLECTION WAS THERE

564
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,636
WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

565
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,267
ADDITIONAL MATERIAL ABOUT

566
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,312
PAGE AND WHY THERE WAS

567
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,319
PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE HE

568
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:21,821
WAS AN AGENT OF A FOREIGN

569
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:22,141
POWER.

570
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,393
AND THE DOSSIER WAS PART OF

571
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,519
THAT BUT WAS NOT ALL OF IT

572
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,927
OR A CRITICAL PART OF IT.

573
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,729
MY RECOLLECTION --

574
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:30,580
>> Bret: INTEL BRIEFING AT

575
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,559
TRUMP TOWER YOU BRIEFED THE

PRESIDENT-ELECT ON THE

577
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,127
SLIVER OF THE DOSSIER,

578
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,333
REALLY THE SALACIOUS PART

579
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,729
ABOUT THE PROSTITUTES IN

580
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,386
MOSCOW AND THAT ALLEGATION.

581
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:38,687
>> CORRECT.

582
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:39,307
>> Bret: DIDN'T INCLUDE

583
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:40,490
ANYTHING BROADER THAN THAT,

584
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:40,833
CORRECT?

585
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,334
>> CORRECT.

586
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,092
MY MISSION THIS THAT PRIVATE

587
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:43,944
BRIEFING WAS JUST TO TELL

588
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:45,745
HIM ABOUT THAT SLICE OF IT.

589
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:46,846
>> Bret: AND WHO SUGGESTED

590
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:47,448
YOU BRIEF THAT?

591
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,242
>> I THINK THE DIRECTOR OF

592
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:49,942
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DID

593
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:50,999
AND EXPLAINED THE LOGIC OF

594
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,645
WHY IT MADE SENSE FOR ME TO

595
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,653
DO IT, WHICH I AGREED WITH.

596
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:55,381
>> Bret: THAT BRIEFING WAS

597
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:55,953
JUST ORAL.

598
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:56,407
JUST TALKING.

599
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:56,904
>> RIGHT.

600
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:57,879
JUST THE TWO OF US TALKING

601
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,207
TO EACH OTHER.

602
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,134
>> Bret: CNN ROARED A TIME

603
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:02,055
YOU HANDED TWO PAGE SUMMARY

604
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,262
OF THE DOSSIER OVER TO HIM.

605
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:04,557
>> DID I NOT.

606
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,211
>> Bret: DID NOT.

607
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,142
SPEAKING OF CNN YOU WRITE IN

608
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,217
THE MEMOS OF THAT MEETING

609
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,565
YOU WRITE I SAID TO

610
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:09,462
PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP MEDIA

611
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,318
LIKE CNN HAD THE DOSSIER AND

612
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:12,466
WERE LOOKING FOR A NEWS

613
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:12,774
HOOK.

614
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,067
I SAID IT WAS INFLAMMATORY

615
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:14,367
STUFF.

616
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,368
THE STORY OF THAT BRIEFING

617
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,723
LEAKS OUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

618
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:17,653
AFTER YOU DO IT.

619
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,671
CNN AND OTHERS RUN THE STORY

620
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,273
OF THIS UNVERIFIED DOSSIER.

621
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,375
DID YOU OR YOUR SUBORDINATES

622
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:22,731
LEAK THAT.

623
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:23,076
>> NO.

624
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,984
>> DID JAMES CLAPPER?

625
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:26,379
>> NO.

626
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,681
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NO.

627
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,282
>> Bret: JOHN BRENNAN.

628
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:29,939
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO LEAKED

629
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:30,189
IT.

630
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,007
I HAD NO PART IN LEAKING ANY

631
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:31,508
OF IT.

632
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,590
IT WAS FOUR OR FIVE DAYS

633
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,395
LATER THAT IT LEAKED.

634
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:34,187
I REMEMBER BECAUSE THE

635
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:34,842
PRESIDENT-ELECT CALLED ME

636
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:35,492
ABOUT IT.

637
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:36,989
>> Bret: DID YOU EVER TRY TO

638
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:37,345
FIND OUT.

639
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:38,691
>> WHO LEAKED UNCLASSIFIED

640
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,392
PUBLIC DOCUMENT?

641
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,399
NO.

642
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,748
>> Bret: DID YOU INFORM THE

643
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:42,595
PRESIDENT-ELECT AT THE TIME

644
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,496
WHAT YOU KNEW ABOUT HOW IT

645
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,053
WAS FUNDED OR WHO WAS BEHIND

646
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:45,303
IT.

647
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:46,805
>> NO, I DID NOT.

648
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,301
>> Bret: DID YOU INFORM HIM

649
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:48,958
THAT CHRISTOPHER STEELE HAD

650
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:49,959
BEEN FIRED BY THE FBI?

651
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,504
>> NO.

652
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,362
>> Bret: OR THAT HE HAD

653
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:52,661
LIED.

654
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,206
>> NO.

655
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,082
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THOSE

656
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:55,464
THINGS AT THAT TIME ANYWAY.

657
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:56,965
>> Bret: OR HAD ABUSED AT

658
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:58,467
LEAST IN PART TO GET THIS

659
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,512
FISA APPLICATION TO SPY ON

660
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,389
SOMEBODY IN HIS CAMPAIGN.

661
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:01,114
>> NO.

662
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,423
DIDN'T COME UP.

663
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:04,772
>> Bret: IS IT FAIR TO SAY

664
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:05,323
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA.

665
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:07,927
>> CARTER PAGE WAS IN HIS

666
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:10,077
CAMPAIGN WHEN THE FISA ORDER

667
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:10,577
WAS.

668
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:11,154
>> Bret: TANGENTIALLY.

669
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:13,025
>> AT ONE POINT, CORRECT.

670
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:13,854
>> Bret: IS IT FAIR TO IS A

671
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,235
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS INNER

672
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:16,785
CIRCLE KNEW A LOT MORE ABOUT

673
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:18,231
THE DOSSIER AND SCOPE OF THE

674
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:18,735
INVESTIGATION THAN

675
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:19,337
PRESIDENT-ELECT AND HIS

676
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:19,660
TEAM.

677
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,032
>> NO.

678
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,388
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR AT

679
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:21,734
ALL.

680
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,891
>> Bret: YOU THINK THEY WERE

681
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:23,736
EQUAL AS FAR AS THE

682
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,092
BRIEFING?

683
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,293
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY

684
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:26,794
KNEW THE SAME SET OF FACTS

685
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,196
AS DID THE LEADERS OF

686
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:28,641
CONGRESS.

687
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,198
>> Bret: THERE WAS NO

688
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:29,912
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE

689
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:31,449
FBI TOLD THE FISA COURT AND

690
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:33,751
WHAT THE -- ABOUT THE

691
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:34,421
TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

692
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,055
AND WHAT YOU TOLD THE NEW

693
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:35,672
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

694
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:36,005
STATES?

695
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:37,550
>> WHAT THE FBI AND THE FISA

696
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,153
APPLICATION SAID IN OCTOBER

697
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,254
OF 2016?

698
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,012
I DON'T REMEMBER CLEAR

699
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:43,813
ENOUGH ALL THAT'S IN THE

700
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:44,957
FISA APPLICATION BUT WE SURE

701
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,432
DIDN'T LAY THAT OUT FOR

702
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:47,216
ANYBODY, PRESIDENT OBAMA,

703
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:47,866
PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, OR

704
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,462
THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS.

705
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:49,867
>> Bret: OKAY.

706
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:50,721
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

707
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:51,369
INTERACTIONS WITH PRESIDENT

708
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,971
TRUMP AND YOUR MEMOS

709
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,524
MEMORIALIZING THAT.

710
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:56,189
AFTER YOU'RE FIRED ON

711
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:58,026
CAPITOL HILL, WE LEARNED

712
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:09,782
THIS:  '17.

713
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,384
>> I ASKED A FRIEND OF MINE

714
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,486
TO SHARE THE CONTENT OF THE

715
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,263
MEMO WITH A REPORTER.

716
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:16,589
DIDN'T DO IT MYSELF FOR A

717
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,897
VARIETY OF REASONS BUT I

718
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:18,891
ASKED HIM TO BECAUSE I

719
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,892
THOUGHT THAT MIGHT PROMPT

720
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,167
THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL

721
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:21,494
COUNSEL.

722
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,995
SO I ASKED A CLOSE FRIEND OF

723
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:23,796
MINE TO DO IT.

724
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,497
>> WHO WAS THAT?

725
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,702
>> A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO

726
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:27,156
IS A PROFESSOR AT COLUMBIA

727
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:28,408
LAW SCHOOL.

728
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:29,059
>> Bret: SO WHAT

729
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,979
SPECIFICALLY DID YOU LEAK TO

730
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:31,360
MR. RICHMAN?

731
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,113
>> I SENT MR. RICHMAN A COPY

732
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:36,116
OF A TWO-PAGE UNCLASSIFIED

733
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,517
MEMO AND ASKED HIM TO GET

734
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:38,566
THE SUBSTANCE OF IT OUT TO

735
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,012
THE MEDIA.

736
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:40,913
>> Bret: YOU CALL HIM A GOOD

737
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:41,999
FRIEND AND PROFESSOR BUT YOU

738
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:44,917
DIDN'T REVEAL YOU HAD HIRED

739
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,719
EMPLOYEE FOR THE FBI TO WORK

740
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,375
ON SPECIAL PROJECTS.

741
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:48,627
WHY?

742
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:49,678
>> BECAUSE IT WASN'T

743
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,224
RELEVANT.

744
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,332
HE WAS FBI SPECIAL

745
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:54,784
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE UNTIL

746
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,861
FEBRUARY OF 2000 --

747
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,365
>> Bret: DID YOU HAVE OTHER

748
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,036
SPECIAL ADVISORS LIKE THAT.

749
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:00,533
>> NO, HUH-UH.

750
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,289
>> Bret: WHAT EXACTLY WAS

751
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:01,641
HIS JOB?

752
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,336
>> TWO THINGS.

753
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,043
HIS PRIMARY FOCUS WAS OUR

754
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:05,794
GOING DARK CHALLENGE.

755
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:07,740
HELPING US THINK THROUGH AND

756
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,796
ARTICULATE AND FIGHT FOR

757
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:10,048
ACCESS TO ENCRYPTED

758
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:11,119
COMMUNICATIONS AND THEN LAW

759
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,066
ENFORCEMENT DATA WAS A BIG

760
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,451
PART OF HIS

761
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,046
RESPONSIBILITIES.

762
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:14,922
>> Bret: DID YOU LEAK OTHER

763
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,349
THINGS THROUGH MR. RICHMAN.

764
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:16,749
>> YEAH.

765
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,560
THE REASON I'M SMILING,

766
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:19,858
BRET.

767
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,359
I DON'T CONSIDER WHAT I

768
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,911
SHARED MR. RICHMAN A LEAK.

769
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,739
I TOLD --

770
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,359
>> LET ME ANSWER YOUR

771
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:26,734
QUESTION.

772
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,761
I GAVE HIM NOTHING ELSE EVER

773
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,919
TO SHARE WITH THE MEDIA.

774
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,419
>> Bret: FBI PROTOCOL SAYS

775
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:33,120
YOUR OWN EMPLOYMENT

776
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,066
AGREEMENT WITH THE FBI

777
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:34,967
PROHIBITS THE UNAUTHORIZED

778
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,768
DISCLOSURE OF ANY

779
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,674
INFORMATION OR MATERIAL FROM

780
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,271
OR RELATED TO FBI FILES OR

781
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,872
ANY INFORMATION ACQUIRED BY

782
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,173
VIRTUE OF MY OFFICIAL

783
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,029
EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT PRIOR

784
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,783
WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE

785
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:44,076
FBI.

786
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:44,852
DID HAVE YOU WRITTEN

787
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:45,235
PERMISSION?

788
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:45,532
>> NO.

789
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:46,184
AND I DIDN'T CONSIDER IT

790
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:47,983
PART OF AN FBI FILE.

791
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,988
ALL THE THINGS THAT I TALKED

792
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:50,383
ABOUT.

793
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,091
>> Bret: YOU WROTE IT AS FBI

794
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:51,484
DIRECTOR.

795
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,192
IT WAS WORK PRODUCT.

796
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:52,885
>> NO.

797
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:53,386
IT WAS NOT.

798
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,089
IT WAS MY PERSONAL AID TO

799
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:57,490
MEMOIR.

800
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,145
>> Bret: MEETING PRESIDENT.

801
00:15:58,145 --> 00:15:59,098
>> I CARRIED TWO COPIES OF

802
00:15:59,098 --> 00:15:59,392
IT.

803
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,399
ONE TO KEEP IN MY PERSONAL

804
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,294
SAFE AT HOME AND I LEFT

805
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,295
ANOTHER ONE AT THE FBI SO

806
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,496
THE BUREAU COULD ALWAYS HAVE

807
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,297
ACCESS TO IT.

808
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,902
I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT AS

809
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,404
MINE LIKE A DIARY.

810
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:08,200
>> Bret: WHO ELSE DID YOU

811
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,086
GIVE, LEAK, WHATEVER YOU

812
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,303
WANT TO CALL IT.

813
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,161
>> USE IS WHAT I PREFER.

814
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,130
>> Bret: THE MEMOS TO.

815
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,766
>> I GAVE THE MEMOS TO MY

816
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,709
LEGAL TEAM AFTER I GAVE THEM

817
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,417
TO DAN RICHMAN AFTER I GAVE

818
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:19,018
THEM TO THE MEDIA.

819
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,419
I'M SORRY, GAVE FOUR MEMOS

820
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,814
TO MY LEGAL TEAM.

821
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,921
>> Bret: WHICH INCLUDED

822
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:23,524
PATRICK FITZGERALD.

823
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,649
HE WAS A LEGAL TEAM AT THAT

824
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:24,923
TIME.

825
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,419
>> CORRECT, SURE.

826
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,576
DAVID KELLY AND DAN RICHMAN.

827
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:30,323
>> Bret: YOU SAID IN THE

828
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,979
MEMOS I SAID I DON'T DO

829
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:33,332
SNEAKY THINGS, I DON'T LEAK.

830
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:36,184
I DON'T DO WEASEL MOVES.

831
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:37,335
WE CAN ARGUE WHAT A LEAK IS

832
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:38,685
BUT THAT'S A LEAK, ISN'T IT?

833
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:43,240
>> IT'S NOT.

834
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,691
>> Bret: OKAY.

835
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:46,939
HERE'S WHAT YOU TOLD CHUCK

836
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,443
GRASSLEY ABOUT LEAKING.

837
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:55,047
>> DIRECTOR COMEY, HAVE YOU

838
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:57,049
SOURCE IN NEWS REPORTS ABOUT

839
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,681
MATTERS RELATING TO THE

840
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:00,810
TRUMP INVESTIGATION OR THE

841
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,009
CLINTON INVESTIGATION?

842
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,114
>> NEVER.

843
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:05,566
>> HAS ANY CLASSIFIED

844
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,259
INFORMATION RELATING TO

845
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,320
PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HIS

846
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,765
ASSOCIATION -- ASSOCIATES

847
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,766
BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND SHARED

848
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,271
WITH THE MEDIA?

849
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:16,875
>> NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

850
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,569
>> Bret: SO AT WHAT POINT

851
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,671
WERE YOU MADE AWARE THAT

852
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,948
SOME OF THE INFORMATION WAS

853
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:20,951
CLASSIFIED BY THE FBI?

854
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:22,875
>> WHICH INFORMATION?

855
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,030
>> Bret: IN THE MEMOS?

856
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,832
>> OH, YEAH.

857
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:26,986
I DON'T KNOW, SOME TIME

858
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,586
AFTER I WAS FIRED THE FBI

859
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,539
APPARENTLY MADE A DECISION

860
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:31,984
THAT THERE WERE SOME WORDS

861
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,294
IN AT LEAST TWO OF THE

862
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:34,409
MEMOS, MAYBE ONE, I THINK

863
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:35,844
TWO, THAT WERE

864
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:36,589
DIPLOMATICALLY SENSITIVE.

865
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,346
AND SO MY LAWYERS RETURNED

866
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:42,377
THEM TO THE FBI.

867
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:43,796
BUT MY TESTIMONY WAS

868
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,398
TRUTHFUL AND I STAND BY IT I

869
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,455
WAS HOPING YOU WERE GOING TO

870
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:47,605
ASK ME THAT.

871
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:48,104
>> Bret: I AM.

872
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:48,457
I WAS.

873
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,302
>> IT WAS TRUTHFUL.

874
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,804
>> Bret: I WANT TO PLAY WHAT

875
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:53,359
ABOUT YOU ON THIS CHANNEL.

876
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,860
>> LOOK, COMEY IS A LEAKER

877
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,414
AND HE'S A LIAR.

878
00:17:57,414 --> 00:17:59,513
AND NOT ONLY ON THIS STUFF,

879
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,766
HE'S BEEN LEAKING FOR YEARS.

880
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,868
HE'S PROBABLY BEEN USING HIS

881
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:06,003
FRIEND, THE SO-CALLED

882
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,320
TO HAVE FBI CLEARANCE, WHICH

883
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,121
HE NEVER SAID.

884
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,222
HE EVEN LIED ABOUT THAT.

885
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,324
BECAUSE HE NEVER SAID THAT

886
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:11,825
IN CONGRESS.

887
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,507
HE SAID HE GAVE IT TO A

888
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:13,826
FRIEND.

889
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,128
AND HE GAVE IT TO A FRIEND

890
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,830
TO LEAK CLASSIFIED

891
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,282
INFORMATION.

892
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:18,931
IT'S ALL CLASSIFIED.

893
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,835
IT WAS TOTALLY CLASSIFIED.

894
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,537
SO ILLEGALLY HE DID AN

895
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,337
ILLEGAL ACT AND HE SAID IT

896
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:25,646
HIMSELF.

897
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,940
IN ORDER TO GET A SPECIAL

898
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,997
COUNSEL AGAINST ME.

899
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:30,743
>> Bret: REACTION TO THAT?

900
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,571
>> HE IS JUST WRONG.

901
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,354
FACTS REALLY DO MATTER,

902
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,347
WHICH IS WHY I'M ON THE SHOW

903
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,248
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.

904
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,850
THAT MEMO WAS UNCLASSIFIED

905
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,150
THEN.

906
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,951
IT'S STILL UNCLASSIFIED.

907
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,575
IT'S IN MY BOOK.

908
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:41,854
THE FBI CLEARED THAT BOOK

909
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,660
BEFORE IT COULD BE

910
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,055
PUBLISHED.

911
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,014
THAT'S A FALSE STATEMENT.

912
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:45,913
>> Bret: WHAT ABOUT NOT

913
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:47,860
TELLING CONGRESS THAT HE WAS

914
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,416
AN AGENT FOR YOU OR WORKED

915
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,821
AT THE FBI OR SOMEHOW WAS

916
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,290
SOME EMPLOYEE THAT HAD YOU

917
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,474
35,000 FBI EMPLOYEES.

918
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:56,669
>> NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE --

919
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,472
I MEAN, I DESCRIBED YOU HIM

920
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,373
I HOPE GOOD FRIEND.

921
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,174
EXPOSE BIAS CONNECTION TO

922
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:02,551
THE GUY?

923
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,800
HE HAD LEFT HIS FBI JOB

924
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,578
MONTHS EARLIER.

925
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,686
THERE IS LOTS OF OTHER

926
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:07,136
CONNECTIONS.

927
00:19:07,136 --> 00:00:00,000
I KNOW HIM BECAUSE WE WERE
