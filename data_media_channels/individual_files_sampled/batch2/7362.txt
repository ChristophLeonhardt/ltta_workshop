authorities have identified the suspected shooter in the incredibly tragic Las Vegas shooting that just occurred his name is Steven paddock and he is a 64 year old white male with no prior criminal history let's go to graphic 16 please paddock was a resident of Mesquite Nevada where he lived in a retirement home his neighbors describe him as an individual who kept to himself in some instances someone who wasn't necessarily polite or friendly in any way but didn't do anything that really stood out he just wanted to keep to himself he also had a longtime live-in girlfriend who was out of the country at the time of the shooting however authorities have said that they have gotten in touch with her and are now questioning her as a person of interest all right so the Las Vegas police under sheriff says the following all of the checks that we have been able to do other than a routine traffic violation here in Nevada and nationwide working with our local FBI partners have been able to find no derogatory history on that individual also there is something that does stand out when it comes to his behavior it's not criminal but it is a little cause for concern authorities were aware of him because of the fact that he would gamble and he would gamble quite a bit on multiple occasions patek gambled more than ten thousand dollars per day and in some cases amounts greater than $20,000 and $30,000 at Las Vegas casinos now the reports currently indicate that it is unclear whether those were wins or losses but his brother indicates that he would call him randomly and say hey I won $250,000 now the press managed to talk to his brother Eric and get some statements from him and I want to share those statements with you let's take a look he's never sure I mean he's never even drawn his gun yeah it makes no sense he's never hit anybody he's never done it or just yeah look you got a couple of handguns I think he had a safe with a couple handguns he might have had one long rifle but he didn't have any I mean he had no automatic weapons when that I know that I knew over at any time I there's no it just just makes no sense yeah I disagree so first of all it's just couple of handguns and a long rifle I mean it's not even a gun guy he's not a gun enthusiast so at a minimum that's three weapons right there uh wait what why do you need three weapons so you're gonna shoot what a deer and a duck at the same time you're gonna use a rifle and then to blast them away and what do you what do you need all those guns for and now of course it turns I'm not blaming his brothers brother I just got nothing to do with it but it turns out no he had actually 30 weapons yeah that's a gun enthusiast and well like we talked about often this is every gun owner guilty of course not right there folks here that own guns now if you have 30 weapons are you looking forward to using them unfortunately the answer is usually yes that doesn't mean that you're gonna do mass shootings well you're to use that gun though can't wait to use it and here he is anyone to abusing it so he's shocked I'm not shocked if you know someone that has a lot of weapons and yes three is already a lot even if that's all he knew about it sounds like he knew that there was a little bit more again I'm not blaming his brother he's I'm just stating the facts of this case okay you know what that's a lot of guns you should be concerned because people a lot of guns are Jozy to figure out how to use them so you could say no oh my god that's so discriminatory by the way the guys who say that's discriminatory will blame 1.6 billion Muslims for the actions of a couple of Muslims that statistics are irrelevant facts are irrelevant so don't pretend that you're not looking to profile people ok now if you're gonna profile people of course on males are the number one category you should look at almost always the shooters a male almost always if you I don't think profiling is the right thing to do under those circumstances I'm based on race religion or even gender but if you're looking at shooters they're males they're almost always males ok so you look at gamblers Jesus man that's the first story I've ever heard of a gambler shooting it doesn't mean that there aren't other gamblers who've done shootings but we're gonna profile all gamblers no profiling billions of people to try to find one or two or ten people among billions if you don't understand why that's maniacal and incredibly stupid you don't understand math at all okay now if but on the other hand who is likely to do a mass shooting well if you've got a gun at least you're capable so you have the ability to do a mass shooting are we narrowing it down unfortunately in the u.s. not by much because there's 89 guns for every 100 people in America and we're all armed to the teeth I just don't want you pretending to be surprised there'll be a mass shooting tomorrow there'll be a mass shooting the day after and those are mass shootings that probably won't make news because you know these shooters up the ante there are these giant mass shootings where we're now you know the death toll with this particular one has already reached 59 and so when there's a mass shooting where 10 people get killed is it gonna break headlines is it gonna be a breaking news story that people cover no these shootings happen on a regular basis and it's impossible to cover every single one of them because they happen so often well to be fair though there's a lot of those mass hangings and mass knifings right no actually there's no mass hangings and everyone's like it was a decade there'll be a mass knifing and two people will get knifed and people like see see it could happen theoretically it could happen but there's a mass shooting on average about every single day in America for people being shot is a mass shooting so tomorrow there'll be one probably with six people no day after eight and twelve and those won't even get reported cuz we're so used to Oh a dozen people murdered no big deal you got to get through these kind of numbers 59 dead five hundred injured four people to go oh I guess that won't know a while that one was a bad one I just also want to already preemptively respond to what I know is gonna be the criticism - any remarks that are made on the show in regard to this story the issue that people have with so-called politicizing a mass shooting like this okay well those are also the same people who literally cannot wait to politicize a story involving someone in Europe who runs over a crowd of people right before you even ID'd the individual it's already oh we got a ban Muslims from coming to the country Trump's Muslim ban is a good idea Trump himself does that but today when Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked during a press conference and of course that's the White House press secretary whether or not there will be any attempt at bipartisan legislation to do something to prevent this from happening in the future guess what she said we don't want to deal with this today maybe maybe in a couple of days you know they don't want to politicize it okay great yeah let's you got a deal so you don't want to deal with the mass shooting that happened today you want to give it 24 hours well there was a mass shooting yesterday so let's deal with it today there was a mass shooting the day before so let's deal with it today there's been a mass shooting almost every single day of the year there's been 273 mass shootings and there's been 275 days this year so okay just pick one pick any of them and let's talk about it now oh you see you never want to talk about it you never ever want to talk about it cuz Sarah Huckabee Sanders you're part of the corruption Donald Trump you're part of the corruption you guys take money from gun manufacturers and are okay with Americans dying because of it because you profit from it hey I got a campaign donation from the NRA so people get murdered what do I care why don't you just say that and be honest about it you're willing to politicize every issue in every way did somebody take a knee what was their were they standing were they sitting you're willing to politicize that to the to the hilt and you're not willing to talk about what is politics politics is hopefully not about games and winning and losing and how many Democrats or Republicans there and I get criticized by the Democrats all the time oh you're not on Team Democrat goddamn right I'm not okay if you'd the Democrat is on our team then I'm happy to support him if he's not I'm not gonna support a Democrat that's corrupt just because he's a D on his team on his helmet that's not all we're doing here what we care about is policy and policy matters because we don't want people getting killed we don't want a massacre in Las Vegas or anywhere else where does this get murdered hundreds get injured so what do you need to do you need to do politics to get through policy when somebody says don't do politics or don't politicize it what they is don't take any action cuz I get bribed by these guys who profit off your death if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know
