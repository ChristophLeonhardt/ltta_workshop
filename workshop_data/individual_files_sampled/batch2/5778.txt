joining the table here in Washington what's your heart bless his heart Republican senator yesterday he won his party's nomination for re-election in the first primary of this crucial midterm season senator great to see ya I've got to say you you did have the tweet of the week when people were talking about Brooklyn barbecue you said bless and bless your heart and I we were talking beforehand the actual picture of the barbecue against interest the saddest are the little pickles on the side I'm in promise that's a cry for help speaking of a cry for help Gary Cohen has left and a lot of Republicans are City you're looking at that looking at this president and the tariffs he's talked about it since the early 1980s I'm I'm sure you let him up on the campaign trail about about sounding like a Democrat when it came to tariffs what first of all I need to ask the first question do you disagree with the president's position on tariffs and if you do of course you do what can the Senate do to get in the way of it well look I think it's tariffs tariffs on steel and aluminum are a mistake I think there are a lot more jobs in this country that are dependent on steel and aluminum as inputs and when we're gonna end up costing more jobs because of the tariffs that then will be saved and that doesn't even factor into account the retaliatory tariffs that we may see Europe and China and other trying partners do which could hurt farmers manufacturers so I disagree with this to be honest the president has heard from me on this he's heard from most senators on this can you guys do anything in the Senate as a practical matter probably not because I think anything we tried to do I think the Democrats would filibuster and and the Senate right now with a fifty one-vote majority very little is moving through the Senate and and under our federal laws the president has wide authority on trade I think in the administration they're differing voices and so I've tried to do what I can to encourage the voices that want to expand free trade for example on right I've suggested let's use that as an opportunity to open up Mexican energy markets that that would be good for Mexico develop those energy markets but it'd be great for Texas great for this country and produce thousands of jobs here so what's the impact we we had this debate before on set what is the impact for a working-class family of four in Lubbock going into going Walmart or trying to buy a new car what it what is the long-term impact for working-class Americans for people in Texas struggling from paycheck to paycheck to get by of tariffs and the tariffs or that they would start well look it depends on what actually happens it depends on the substance what the president goes with the numbers that he's talking look at this point he made an off-the-cuff comment and and the details will matter a lot more height whether it applies to everybody to some whether it's at the same numbers so I will say if you look at those working-class voters and I agree we ought to be looking exactly those are the people we're working for right the benefits we've seen in the last year and a half from the tax cut passed in December from regulatory reform we're saying the economy booming in Texas were seeing more jobs people are getting pay raises and bonuses wages are going up and and so the working-class voters that's who elected Republicans in 2016 that's who we need to be responsive to it so my hope is that that either this doesn't get implemented or it gets implemented in a fairly small way listen it is worth noting george w bush also put steel tariffs in place i disagreed with george w bush at the time also but run but trump is not the first republican to do that are you saying that there's a chance he might change his mind on this because he might not be serious about it I'm serious I think the president has shown wide flexibility on sorry but then you have a Gary Cohn leaving um this was apparently the final straw a lot of other reasons some people right point to that might be why he left but he left on this what does that tell you about what is happening in this administration and how do you work with it what look there's no doubt there's been some change over you know there there was a lot of discussion that Gary was likely to leave after after the tax people leaving and I mean it's who knows what tomorrow is it this I have joked if you don't like the news give it 30 seconds it'll change I mean this is a unusual time to put it mildly Jeb Bush had said that Donald Trump and I think we all played the clip a couple days ago Jeb Bush was it said that Donald Trump is a chaos candidate he'll be the chaos president do you agree with that assessment you know the assessment I agree with is that I actually think it's remarkable what we got accomplished in 2017 despite the chaos despite the chaos and the approach that I've tried to follow in the Senate is to ignore the chaos ignore you know as I'm walking down the Capitol my sort of standard rule of thumb is as reporters ask you questions is and you know this well I won't comment on tweets right I won't comment on the random comment of the day whatever whatever the scandal du jour is I got nothing to say about it if you want to talk substance if you want to talk tax policy or regulatory reform or Obamacare or judges or national security I'll talk that yeah and I think despite the political circus of Washington right it's remarkable the tax cut was historic the successes on regulatory reform repealing the Obamacare individual mandate which at which I helped lead the effort to get done was a remarkable victory okay so what so you're talking about policy let's talk about a policy that right now Mike and I are concerned about and been talking to a lot of friends in the foreign policy community about and that is the gains that have been made against Isis in Iraq and in Syria the alliance that that we've had with the Kurds that the Kurds that are actually doing an extraordinary job will the United States of America will the United States Senate stands shoulder-to-shoulder with our Kurdish allies despite what turkey said and will we not repeat the same mistake that we made in 2011 where we withdraw the troops and we allow Isis to move back in again you know Joe I think that's a great question the the Kurds have proven for decades to be strong and loyal friends of ours and I got to admit I think America's treatment in multiple administration's of the Kurds it has been nothing less than she's been shameful they had the Peshmerga the fighting forces of the Kurds are effective fighters they stood with us against Isis they stood with us against Saddam Hussein and and yet over and over again we've seen the American foreign policy establishment turned their boss on the curt's oh because they don't want to dismay the Sunnis they don't want to dismay the the Shia they don't want to just disarray the Turks you know it's all of the different players listen I am one who has called repeatedly for a free and independent Kurdistan and and I've met with Kurdish leaders many times because I think that would be number one I think they deserve it I think I think they're their own people with their own culture with their own language but number two it would be beneficial to America to have a strong and stable country in the Middle East they were also is not an enemy and they were the boots on the ground so that that helped push back Isis that were reliable and that have been reliable time and time again that's I mean it's it's absolutely right and and and frankly you know we as a country have had a very unique relationship with the Kurds over many many years i senator I want to ask you about shift gears a little bit ask you about politics but not about this about this president you have said that you think Democrats will crawl over broken glass to vote in November and warned that Texas could turn blue now Democrats have been dreaming about that it's never happened but how much help do you think you're going to need from the National Party in November as you face Bader or work and is Mitch McConnell giving you the help you need look I have been pleased the most significant help in the Senate that that I need and the rest of us need is to keep delivering results that we're producing remember when 2017 started I laid out for big priorities for the new administration the new Congress tax reform regulatory reform Obamacare and judges and and for the last two years that's consumed almost my every waking moment trying to bring Republicans together and deliver on those promises the degrees to which we succeeded were remarkable we need to keep doing that and that's what I'm urging my colleagues to do is let's not take our eye off the ball we have what may be a unique moment in time and Republican president Republican majorities in both houses that doesn't happen very often so let's not blow the opportunity have you rebuilt your relationship with Mitch McConnell since 2013 actually mentioned I haven't have a very good working relationship together I mean because at this point you know when on tax reform on Obamacare both of us want it to get the job accomplished and so you know I think right now in the Senate I'm actually in a fairly unusual position because I because I'm able to speak with real credibility to conservatives but also able to speak to moderates to leadership to the President to the administration and to try to bring everyone together and say all right what's the common ground on the Venn diagram where is our very different Ted Cruz than I remember we showed up in the US Senate finder Jeff really guys in fact Ted Cruz's relationship is so good with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that yesterday he actually ordered in Brooklyn boys all he could eat for a week I was disgraceful I'm proud of you for speaking out against Brooklyn barbecue senator on let me ask you though I want to go back to what you called an offhand comment by the president talking about 25% tariffs on steel 10% on aluminum and saying effectively you know I don't answer the tweet of the day I don't talk about the scandal of the hour the problem is that offhand comment as you referred to it collapsed the markets it's centering allies scrambling in Europe and Senator Allies scrambling and in Asia could potentially set off a trade war how do you make a distinction of what to believe when the president says it or is it your position that we ought not believe the first thing the president says no look I mean that's certainly a reasonable topic for discussion that was a comment the president made on substantive policy and it appears to be that the administration intends to follow through but we don't know the details I'm just saying you don't need to light your hair on fire without knowing the details because things could change they could change and there are a lot of good details you take the tax cut where I spent thousands of hours working on that tax cut there are a lot of big the conservative victories in that tax cut that are producing results last week I was in the White House twice with the president working to get a resolution to ethanol and the broken Rin system that that is bankrupting refineries and costing tens of thousands of blue-collar jobs jobs in my home state of Texas you know two weeks ago I was in Philadelphia at the p/es refinery largest refinery on the East Coast it's going bankrupt because of the failed rinse system we had a rally with 1,200 union members Union guys who are not the type of guys who typically show up and vote Republican right who multiple standing ovations are energized because their jobs are at risk and I want to commend the president in the White House I think we're moving towards a win-win solution on this that is going to save those blue-collar Union jobs and also result in corn farmers selling more corn and that's positive to be able to get a win-win solution for every but senator you see the problem though with dismissing that we're at president's comments as being offhand when again in the case of these tariffs the markets collapsed the markets tanked there are allies across the world worried about it so they don't take them as offhand comments they say that's the president United States sitting in the Oval Office making a statement about policy that's going to affect the world so I'm just curious how you make the distinction about what to believe from this president and what to dismiss as an offhand comment listen I will readily admit that when the president made an offhand comment saying he agrees with most of the Democrats in the Congress look most of the Democrats support tariffs and and when when the president says I agree with the Democrats on that the markets collapsed I think it was a mistake I don't think he should agree with the Democrats on terrorists because I think tariffs kill jobs and and I'll tell you in Texas look in Texas when it comes to NAFTA a lot of people in Texas are nervous about NAFTA renegotiation I think NAFTA renegotiation could be a good thing if we use it to open up the Canadian and Mexican markets Texas in the country does very well if we open up markets but but if NAFTA renegotiation is an excuse to set barriers to our markets and decrease trade that's hurt farmers ranchers manufacturers and and so at least for my part I'm doing everything I can to convince the president the administration to urge them to go the right direction and on the wrong so you take that first comment as an opening bid and then you hope to work with the White House from there to get it to where you think would be a better position III think it is an ongoing discussion and I'm going to continue to try to influence it in a positive way Mike Barnicle senator I have a gun safety question for you do you think it makes any sense at all common sense here being the determining factor that in some states it's a 18 year old is allowed to buy an assault rifle but is not allowed to buy a handgun you know look I think different states have different laws and I think actually that question if you want to ask common sense what we ought to be asking is what actually stops violent crime you know back in the 1990's under Bill Clinton we had a so-called assault rifle ban that was in effect for a number of years than it expired the apartment of Justice studied that so-called ban found it had no statistically significant effect on violent crime it's a great Democratic talking point and part of the reason is an assault rifle it's not a machine gun machine guns are already functionally illegal they have been for for over 80 years what they call it assault weapon is essentially a scary-looking gun with a plastic handle here or a strap there doesn't make it any more dangerous if you want to stop crime wait what does it actually actually the studies even the Pentagon studies show that that weapons like the ar-15 actually are designed to be more lethal and and there were there were actually and I've talked about the article a good bit there was an article in the Atlantic in 1981 where actually they did an after-action report and there was criticism that it gotten much like the ar-15 wasn't used in Vietnam because it was lighter it was more lethal and it was a more of a killing machine than the guns that our soldiers were using in Vietnam so it is designed to kill more effectively more efficiently Joe the firing mechanisms the lethality of an ar-15 is indistinguishable from many deer rifles and we were having this debate in 2013 and Feinstein proposed her so-called assault weapons ban I put up a picture of one of the most common deer rifles in America owned by millions of Americans under the statute she introduced that was not a quote assault rifle and then I held up a 599 little plastic handle if you attach the plastic handle to it suddenly it was AB and a salsa but your argument here is that that deer rifles are just as lethal if somebody somebody takes a deer rifle into a high school in in in parkland that that deer rifle is going to be as lethal as an ar-15 so Joe my argument is twofold number one going after the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens it doesn't work it was actually the Bill Clinton Justice Department that concluded that the assault weapons ban you know zero statistic better than anybody and I don't want to I mean we don't want we don't want to get into it so we're sort of a moot court argument here but you know better than anyone what the Second Amendment says and what you were involved with Elrod yeah represented 31 states exactly Heller so you know that at least where it stands right now Scalia said that the Second Amendment means that people have a right to keep and bear arms and their homes they have a right to have handguns in their home they have a right to have shotguns in their home just say in their home by the way the home is not a qualified but if you go from 2008 and the decision in 2010 all the way through now obviously the Supreme Court has denied cert time and time again for limitations on assault-style weapons for limitations on carry for limitations on just about everything but what you and others successfully argued in Heller so having in the Heller was about a semi-automatic handgun which the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment protected and the district of law and BIA couldn't ban but you know though that every American doesn't have a constitutional second Amendment right to carry they are 15 yes or no yeah I'm not gonna debate that the courts have assessment no they haven't that's not what a denial of cert means the court often on an area of constitutional litigation will let the federal courts of appeals they call it percolating which is to let say the pinnacle of science has no president senator there are a lot of people lawyers right now that are rolling their eyes at what you're saying because this percolation has been going on for ten years that's my career was litigating before the Supreme Court so so actually this is not an uncommon thing I recognize that's not what you do but but the court do you wait I don't need you to lecture me on what the Supreme Court does and what it doesn't do witness if the Supreme Court deny cert time and time again and they have since 2010 and and they've allowed Connecticut's laws to stand in place it actually banned as assault-style weapons so right now the court is sitting back and they are allowing that to remain in place and allowing that that is constitutional right now there is not a constitutional right and you know it and you can talk down to me all you want to but you know there is not a constitutional always talking down to whom you say lawyers are rolling their eyes at me me let's go said this is what you do I understand it's not what you do Joe but I do understand this even a dumb country lawyer like me understands that an ar-15 today is not recognized as a constitutional right of Americans under the Second Amendment is that right or actually under the test that the Supreme Court laid out in Heller whether whether a an instrument of Defense is in common and popular usage the ar-15 is one of the most popular and common weapons in the United States under the test of Heller so clearly we would think that the Supreme Court of the United States would actually accept one of these cases but but but you were talking about what you want the law to be I'm talking about what the law is but the test Scalia laid out is is whether it is popular is this a weapon that is commonly desired that what the Second Amendment says is the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed the right of the people is a term of art the framers used for an individual right and and your point about denying cert every year the court gets about eight thousand cert petitions they grant cert and typically 70 to 80 cases so typically 1% or fewer i Ahmet and so in black-letter law that a denial of cert has no presidential body but the more important is a constitutional right that be is that is infringed upon that by at least four members of the court they will accept cert and they will listen to that right now they're not ethically if there's not a very large or indirect this is the number one determinant on whether the court takes a case is is there a circuit split or the courts of appeals sharply design divided and unable to resolve and so routine I give you credit for swatting away what is reality what is legal reality but is the most this debate if you want to stop violent crime this debate is dancing on the head of a pin okay but here's what hold on I may agree with you senator but the one thing that I think it is that is important well then what am I gonna say the media is that the media gets the arguments around the Second Amendment wrong a lot of time or so do a lot of politicians that go out and say I have a god-given second Amendment right to carry around an ar-15 when that is not the law of the land right now but go ahead and make your point let me give you know Mike asked about common sense and practicality look I've spent a lot of my life in law enforcement dealing with murderers and rapists and violent criminals we need to stop these mass murders now if you want to do it right what isn't effective is gun control many of the jurisdictions where the toughest gun control laws have among the worst crime rates and murder rates what is effective is targeting violent criminals right yesterday I reintroduced legislation Grassley Cruz which is legislation I introduced in 2013 it got voted on the Senate it got a majority vote in the Senate nine Democrats most bipartisan support of any of the comprehensive legislation what had Grassley cruz did number one it increased funding for school safety by three hundred million dollars the obama administration had cut that if Grassley cruz had passed if Harry Reid and the Democrats hadn't filibustered it that could have meant that another armed police officer would have been at Parkland and could have intercepted this gunman before he murdered those teenagers in addition to that Sutherland Springs my home state of Texas four or five southern Springs was the worst Church shooting in history right now Joe I stood in that sanctuary the day after that shooting right I stood with those families held those families cried with those families prayed with those families right one of the most maddening things about Sutherland Springs the shooter there it was already illegal for him to possess a firearm doubly SunRun he had a felony conviction and he had a domestic violence conviction so why did he have a firearm he had a firearm because the airforce under President Obama failed to report the conviction to the background database so what do you do you support what Korn and Murphy are trying to pass right I actually think that it's it has due process problems on one side but more fundamentally it doesn't do nearly enough Grassley Cruz does much more to strengthen the background check system it incentivizes sites to report cadet let me ask you this question and this is where I thought you were going because even Michael Bloomberg will say that banning assault style weapons won't dramatically cut down on the number of gun deaths in America the the problem has much more to do with handguns illegally moving around in areas like Chicago but what do we do what do we tell our children when when it is obvious that there is an epidemic that that there are people that are copycats that are going in buying an ar-15 going and shooting up school shooting up churches shooting up country music concerts we're gonna disagree on the practicality of banning assault style weapons but what can Democrats and Republicans do to make sure that all of our children don't go to their schools or their colleges fearful that they're going to is that which they do now and I'm sure your children do as well look what we could do is pass grassley Cruz grassley Cruz would have directed the Attorney General to audit every federal agency make sure that every conviction is reported that meant that the shooter in Sutherland Springs the Air Force would have reported his convictions but the second piece and this is even more important the Department of Justice for a long time has failed to prosecute felons and fugitives who try to legally buy a firearm so for example in the year 2010 48,000 felons and fugitives try to illegally buy a firearm mMmmm out of those the Obama Justice Department prosecuted 4444 at a 48,000 I think that's completely unacceptable what Grassley Cruz did is created a gun crime task force at the Department of Justice funded prosecutors so if you're a felon and you tried illegally buy a gun you go to jail in Sutherland Springs what that meant is a year before the shooting that shooter went in lied on a background form he checked no I don't have a felony conviction no I don't have a domestic violence conviction those were separate felonies if Grassley Cruz it passed if the Democrats hadn't filibustered it the Department of Justice would have prosecuted that shooter when he lied on that form and he would have been in federal prison instead of in that sanctuary murdering innocent men women and children we can do a lot on this but it won't be effective to give speeches demagoguing law-abiding citizens and gun owners what is effective is target resources and put violent criminals in jail that's what I've been leading the efforts in the Senate to do you asked what should we do to make our schools safer we should take up Grassley Cruz and pass it and I would encourage you the next time you have a Democrat on this show ask them why they fell upon Grassley you're saying take up Grassley Kris q very good you've said that boom boom boom and so I'm gonna look into it and first of all I want to say that I do believe you're wrong on on where we stand as far as constitutional rights with ar-15s but I will say bless your heart but we do agree on Texas bar here here so thank you appreciate you coming in and I think I really do hope you how do you put up with it it's really hard I want to invite you back and if you bring somebody else that's working on the issue of the Kurds I would love to have you thank you for it's a critical one you know we went into Iraq a lot of people were exhausted we went out and most Americans wanted to sleep in 2011 it created the rise of Isis don't want to see that happening again and I'm glad to hear there are a lot of people in the Senate concerned about that as well senator Ted Cruz thank you very much thank you senator thank you for having we should mention you've had your Democratic challenger we had Bader O'Rourke on the show before and we hope to have you both back for interviews as the campaign heats up I look
