1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:02,120
SANCTIMONIOUS, SENSITIVE,

2
00:00:02,121 --> 00:00:03,588
SUPERCILIOUS SNOWFLAKES.

3
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,524
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT.

4
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:06,925
[CHEERS]

5
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:07,859
STEVE: THERE YOU HAVE GOT

6
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,526
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

7
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:09,227
UNITED STATES YESTERDAY

8
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:15,600
LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE.

9
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,569
LET'S BRING IN FOX NEWS

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,203
CONTRIBUTOR TOMI LAHREN

11
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:22,841
TOMI, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

12
00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:23,675
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

13
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:25,744
COMMENTS REGARDING

14
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:27,345
SANCTIMONIOUS SNOWFLAKES ON

15
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:27,979
AMERICA'S CAMPUSES?

16
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,614
>> WELL, HE IS RIGHT ON THE

17
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:29,914
MONEY.

18
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:33,818
I FEEL ABOUT SNOWFLAKES.

19
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:35,687
THIS IS A BIGGER EPIDEMIC

20
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:38,590
NOW OUR HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES

21
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,658
AND ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

22
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,558
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,193
IT'S NOT JUST THAT KIDS GO

24
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:43,928
TO COLLEGE AND THEY ARE

25
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,697
SURROUNDED BY LIBERAL

26
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:46,631
CLASSMATES AND LIBERAL

27
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:49,734
HERE IS THAT CONSERVATIVE

28
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:50,635
AND INDEPENDENT STUDENTS GO

29
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:54,739
I THINK THAT'S THE REAL

30
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,475
LIBERAL IDEAS BUT

31
00:00:57,476 --> 00:00:58,243
CONSERVATIVE IDEAS THEY

32
00:00:58,244 --> 00:00:59,444
DON'T EVEN GET A PLATFORM

33
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:00,378
WITH WHICH TO SPEAK.

34
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,379
I THINK THAT'S THE REAL

35
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,281
ISSUE WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS.

36
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,118
SCHOOLS INCLUDING MIDDLE

37
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,487
BERRY COLLEGE AT VERMONT AND

38
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:10,855
BERKELEY SAYING THEY HAVE

39
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,123
TRIED TO SEE YOU LENS

40
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:12,724
CONSERVATIVE SPEAKERS.

41
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,626
A REPORT THAT THE TOP 45

42
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:15,660
COLLEGES NO CONSERVATIVE WAS

43
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,165
IS THIS GOING TO BACK FIRE

44
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,200
OR YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOUR

45
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:22,901
THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT?

46
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:27,706
LIBERAL CAMPUSES IN THE LONG

47
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,742
AS PEOPLE GET SMARTER AND

48
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:32,410
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT OUR

49
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:33,912
FREE SPEECH ZONE IS THE

50
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:34,846
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AT

51
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:36,748
LARGE AND NOT THE ZONES THAT

52
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:40,485
COLLEGE ARBITRARILY PUT IN

53
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:40,852
PLACE.

54
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:41,519
BEYOND THAT WHEN WE'RE

55
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,754
LOOKING AT COLLEGE CAMPUSES,

56
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:43,855
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

57
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:44,689
UNDERSTAND THAT TRUTH HAS

58
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,558
BECOME THE NEW HATE SPEECH.

59
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:47,792
IT'S NOT JUST COLLEGE

60
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:48,960
CAMPUSES BUT ALSO IN THE

61
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:49,260
MEDIA.

62
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:49,894
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

63
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:50,962
CONSERVATIVE SPEAKERS,

64
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,397
INDEPENDENT SPEAKERS,

65
00:01:52,398 --> 00:01:53,565
LIBERTARIAN SPEAKERS TO SHOW

66
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:55,633
UP ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND

67
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:57,235
NOT BE ALLOW THEMSELVES TO

68
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:58,670
BE BULL IDEA, HARASSED AND

69
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,471
TURNED AWAY.

70
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,439
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

71
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,707
BE LITTLE BIT LOUDER HAVE.

72
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:03,641
TO UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA AND

73
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:04,609
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

74
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,778
IT MORE OF AN ISSUE.

75
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:07,445
OTHERWISE, COLLEGE CAMPUSES

76
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:10,281
ARE JUST GOING TO BE THE

77
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,150
BAGS

78
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,919
BASTIONS OF LIBERAL.

79
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,654
STEVE: GOT TO GET INVITED

80
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:19,457
PEOPLE ABOUT THAT VERY ISSUE

81
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,792
INCLUDING ZAC WOOD WHO WAS

82
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:21,793
JUST ON THIS COUCH.

83
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:24,229
SAID I WAS ON COLLEGE WENT

84
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,131
OUT OF THE WAY INVITE

85
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:26,564
CONSERVATIVES.

86
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:28,133
GOT BIG PUSH BACK.

87
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:29,234
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

88
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:30,135
STATES TOOK AN AGGRESSIVE

89
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:31,136
TONE AGAINST THE IRANIAN

90
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:32,270
LEADERS AFTER THEY TRIED TO

91
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:35,273
WE USED TO LOOK THE OTHER

92
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:35,540
WAY.

93
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,408
NOT UNDER THIS PRESIDENT.

94
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:38,209
YOU SAY IT SHOWS THE APOLOGY

95
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,712
TOUR IS OVER?

96
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:41,613
>> WELL, ABSOLUTELY.

97
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:42,714
ISN'T IT NICE TO FINALLY

98
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:43,782
HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT LEADS

99
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,583
FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH?

100
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:51,523
UPSET JUST LAST WEEK BECAUSE

101
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:54,793
THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO

102
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:55,360
ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC

103
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:56,361
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA NOW

104
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:57,729
OUTRAGED THAT HE WAS TOO

105
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:01,332
STANDARD AT PLAY THERE.

106
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,301
BUT, I BELIEVE THAT THIS

107
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:04,235
PRESIDENT, BEING TOUGH ON

108
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:05,503
WORLD LEADERS IS EXACTLY

109
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:06,204
WHAT HAS WORKED.

110
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,672
WE SAW IT WORK IN NORTH

111
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,239
KOREA.

112
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,574
AND I THINK AS SOON AS

113
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:10,542
LIBERALS UNDERSTAND THAT WE

114
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:11,376
DIDN'T ELECT THIS PRESIDENT

115
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:13,278
TO BE NICE, WE ELECTED HIM

116
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,679
TO GET THINGS DONE AND HE

117
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,713
HAS, MAYBE THEY WILL

118
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:16,548
UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGY AND

119
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,583
THEY WILL GET ON BOARD.

120
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,351
STEVE: WELL, IT IS A KIND OF

121
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,252
STRATEGY IT DOES APPEAR THE

122
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:26,391
KANSAS CITY AT THE VFW

123
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:27,459
CONVENTION, TOMI, SAID THAT

124
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,860
IRAN NO LONGER THE SAME

125
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:30,328
COUNTRY IT WAS A WHILE AGO.

126
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,596
IS HE READY TO MAKE A DEAL.

127
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,766
ADMINISTRATION.

128
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:35,700
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS

129
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:36,601
READY TO MAKE A DEAL WHEN

130
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:38,269
THEY'RE.

131
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,537
>> WELL, IT REALLY WASN'T

132
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:40,271
MUCH OF A DEAL.

133
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:42,373
IT WAS A CONCESSIONS LIST.

134
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:43,541
THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING

135
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,409
TO DO THAT AGAIN.

136
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,310
THIS PRESIDENT COMES TO THE

137
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,277
TABLE AS I SAID FROM A

138
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:47,879
POSITION OF STRENGTH.

139
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,346
UNLIKE THE LAST

140
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,380
ADMINISTRATION WHO TOWERED

141
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:49,848
IN THE CORNER.

142
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,349
THAT'S HOW WE GET RESULTS.

143
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,584
WE ARE SEEING IT TIME AND

144
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:56,421
LIBERALS CRAZY HOW EFFECTIVE

145
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:58,189
THIS PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE IS

146
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,823
HE UNCONVENTIONAL.

147
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:01,159
YES, HE USES TWITTER

148
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:03,661
AS LONG AS IT'S WORKING AND

149
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:04,796
BRINGING PEACE BACK B. IN

150
00:04:04,797 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WORLD, THEY SHOULD BE
