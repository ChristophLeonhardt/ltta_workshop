00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,320
Here on Copacabana Beach
thousands of citizens called on

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,730
President Michel Temer to resign.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,150
Recently an audio recording of
the president discussing plans

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,800
to obstruct an anti-corruption
drive has been released, causing uproar.

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,570
Temer has been president for
only a year since his

6
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,490
predecessor, Dilma Rousseff,
was herself impeached.

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,760
The protesters' slogan "Diretas JÃ¡!"
calls for direct elections

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,830
for Temer's replacement.

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,310
They are fed up with rampant corruption
scandals in their government.

10
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,860
The president's approval rating
is less than 10 percent.

11
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,910
So far he's resisted calls to
resign and instead temporarily

12
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,110
deployed the military against
the ongoing protests.

13
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,880
A panel of judges could invalidate his
presidency or he could be impeached.

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,660
If not, Temer could remain
president until 2018

15
00:01:23,660 --> 00:00:00,000
when there will be fresh
elections.
