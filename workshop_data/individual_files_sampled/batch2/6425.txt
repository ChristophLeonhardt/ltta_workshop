Donald Trump is obviously furious about the Bob Woodward book that came out this week called fear in the trump presidency actually it comes out on Tuesday the 11th but the excerpts hit this week and everybody got to see when an incompetent moron he truly is the day after that was the New York Times op-ed that showed what an incompetent buffoon Donald Trump really is so Donald Trump is obviously very mad about these things because a lot of his staffers talk to Bob Woodward gave him all that information and then this anonymous staffer goes and writes this New York Times op-ed so Donald Trump not knowing who the rats in his administration are has according to insiders in the White House basically secluded himself he's no longer talking to people inside the White House he doesn't know who he can trust so he is becoming more and more isolated within his own administration he won't even speak to Kellyanne Conway because he doesn't know if she may or may not be the rat White House staffers according to Vanity Fair reporter Gabriel Sherman who has some very reliable sources in the White House this is what they had to say it's pandemonium he literally isn't talking to anyone he's cancelled meetings and is on the phone calling up his friends the only people he can trust are his kids right now or so they say they also say that the only people and this is a more important part the only people who are denying that any of these things in the Woodward book or the New York Times op-ed are true are the people of Fox News they're the only ones denying it Trump knows that what these books and these op eds have to say is 100% accurate Fox News is still trying to run interference for him but it's not going so well for them because all you can only deny reality for so long before it eventually smacks you in the face and you're forced to confront it and that is pretty much what is going to happen to Fox News within the coming weeks but Trump doesn't want to hit that point he doesn't want to face these people he doesn't want to face the criticism and he doesn't certainly want to think that people are disloyal to him because that's the only thing in life other than money that he actually values is loyalty so he's withdrawn he's becoming isolated and I have to say that considering the fact that he is technically because of his position the most powerful human being on the planet that's dangerous anger and isolation are dangerous bedfellows and yet that is what we have right now with the President of the United States this also happens to be the sole person in this country who can launch nuclear weapons now I don't think Donald Trump is gonna do something that drastic in order to you know kind of get rid of all this negative publicity but you never know you don't know what this psychopath is gonna do and that's what makes it so scary and the more isolated he feels the more desperate he becomes not just from the book and the op-ed but from all of the investigations into his potential wrongdoings we're gonna see Trump eventually lash out in a way that none of us expected or predicted and that is about the only thing we can predict from what's happening right now he'll eventually do something something drastic something dramatic something completely unexpected in order to avoid this negative publicity and all of the horrible things that he knows are coming in his future the only question is what is that dramatic thing from the president going to be
