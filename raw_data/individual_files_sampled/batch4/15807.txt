day one was that really day one so a lot happened on day one for a while there this is just enormous story that needs telling and it's really hard to imagine getting your arms around it all because there's so much to tell there's clearly the political side of things with a free forum the lobbying groups people trying to campaign to build awareness there's good old folk like the general who fought in wars who understand the land and feel wedded to it you know him talking about the money the bills on his wall and the general saying that million million or so in Zimbabwe currency that somehow that was analogous for the price of life out here now that's a really emotional moment and these big old men talk about their love for the land how they'll die on the land and how if they have to shed their blood for the land they will it's something very kind of biblical about it all and then there's also this biblical theme because religion seems to join a lot of these farmers they seem to God is very important and I can't help but feel that by believing in something it means they can stay here on the land even though they might die because they believe in this greater power that they're going somewhere better that this is just a passageway to something else you know and then spending time in the back of the wagon today waiting to possibly meet one of the farm attackers himself to ask him what it is he's doing who's paying him who's training him why is he doing this that meeting hopefully still to happen and then coming out here to spend a night on a farm where it is eerie you know it's quiet you don't know who's behind things I know that there was a murder just one homestead over the road it is an eerie thing and I can say for certain I'm not easily scared but I definitely go to bed tonight knowing that in the dark is when attack happens and there's nothing to say that it won't be the turn of this farm tonight join me for more of my journey through South Africa at Hopkins worldcom you
