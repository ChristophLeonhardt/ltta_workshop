IT WAS A MASSACRE ON THE SIZE

50
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,887

WITH SERIAL KILLERS.

57
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,440
NOBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HIM,

58
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:47,175

HE MURDERED DOZENS IF NOT

67
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,393
HUNDREDS OF BORN ALIVE BABIES

68
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,695
AND THERE WERE CASUALTIES THAT

69
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:10,565
INCLUDED REFUGEE PREGNANT

70
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,934
MOTHER.

71
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:13,635
THERE ARE MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT

72
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:14,669
AGENCIES THAT SAP WHY DIDN'T I

73
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,705
THINK EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE

74
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:19,741
AWARE.

75
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:21,376
>> Martha: THEY WANT TO DO

76
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:22,944
MAKE SURE THAT WRIGHT WAS

77
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:23,311
PROTECTED.

78
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:24,779
THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STORY.

79
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,414
TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

80
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:29,150
FACTS IS THAT ALL THE JURORS ON

81
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:30,418
THE CASE HAD TO BE PRO-CHOICE TO

82
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,587
BE PUT THERE BECAUSE THEY WANTED

83
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:33,788
THEM TO HAVE THAT PERSPECTIVE.

84
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:36,357
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, EVERY SINGLE

85
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,259
ONE OF THEM BECAME PRO-LIFE

86
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,160
AFTERWARDS.

87
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:39,494
>> YES.

88
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,362
THAT IS CORRECT.

89
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:42,830
I WAS AT THE PREMIERE LAST

90
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,565
FRIDAY IN LOS ANGELES.

91
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,535
I GOT TO MEET THE BRAVE

92
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:48,736
DETECTIVE THAT IS DEPICTED BY

93
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:50,138
DEAN CAIN.

94
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,073
THERE WERE A LOT OF PRO-CHOICE

95
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:54,942
DEMOCRATS AND PRO-ABORTION

96
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:58,446
LIBERALS THAT WERE INVOLVED THAT

97
00:02:58,447 --> 00:02:59,514
REFUSED TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO

00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,984
THE HORROR HERE.

99
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:05,787
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THIS INDIE

100
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:08,056
FILM WAS CROWD FUNDED WITH

101
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:11,392
30,000 DONORS, $2.3 MILLION

102
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:13,995
RAISED OVER 45-DAY PERIOD AFTER

103
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:16,497
THE PRODUCER HAS BEEN KICKED OFF

104
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:17,298
OF PRO-ABORTION RADICAL

105
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:19,934
KICKSTARTER.

106
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:22,236
EVEN IN THE LEAD UP TO THE

107
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:23,871
PREMIERE, YOU HAD A FACEBOOK

108
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,507
BANNING PROMOTION OF ADS.

109
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:27,709
GOOD MPR CENSORING THE

111
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,080
DESCRIPTION.

112
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,349
AN ABORTION DOCTOR.

113
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,118
YOU HAVE A CODE OF SILENCE BY

114
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,319
HOLLYWOOD FILM CRITICS AND YET

115
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,021

116
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:41,989
WE ENTER THE SECOND WEEKEND FOR

117
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,590
THIS MOVIE.

118
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:44,492
>> Martha: WE SHOULD POINT OUT

119
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,928
THAT THIS MOVIE IS RATED PG-13

120
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,863
FOR THAT --

121
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,498
A LOT OF IT IS NOT SEEN THE

122
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,367
