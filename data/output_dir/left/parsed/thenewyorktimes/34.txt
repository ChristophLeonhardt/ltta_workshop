“My name is George
Tillman Jr.,
and I am the director
of “The Hate U Give.”
We always called this
scene “the talk.”
The scene was actually in
the middle of the book,
but we decided very
early on to move it
at the top of the film.
What I love about
this scene is,
outside, you see a
normal neighborhood,
with a lot of playing.
It feels like a
Saturday afternoon.
But I cinematically
wanted to move slowly
towards this house,
to really show
that, while everyone is
having a good time playing,
there’s important business
being done with the Carter
family.
The first guy we
see is Mav Carter.
You see a guy who got
braids, and he got a tattoo,
so your assumption is that
this guy is a gang member
and he’s up to no good.
But as the scene
sort of progressed,
I love turning the
scene on its head
and seeing that he’s not
who you think he is.”
“Now, one day, you’re
all going to be with me,
and you best bet we
gonna get pulled over.”
He’s a guy who’s a
father, a husband,
and he’s talking
about something that’s
a very serious issue, that
he’s telling them to put
their hands on the table.
“You’re going to see me
with my hands like this.”
What I love about
this scene is
that this feels like a normal
conversation like somebody
would have about the birds and
the bees with their children.
But this is a
scene that’s very
normal in a lot of
African-American families
across the country, which is,
how you keep your kids safe.
How do you get
them to understand
how to act around
police officers?
It’s all about a father
protecting his family.
“It can get real dangerous,
so don’t argue with them.
But keep — “
The rehearsal for the
scene was very important.
It started off by rehearsing a
scene with Lamar Johnson, who
plays Seven, and Amandla
Stenberg, who plays Starr.
They rehearsed the
scene, but they are not
actually in the scene, but I
only rehearsed it with them
so they could have it as a
backstory for them, moving
forward, for the
rest of the film.
“Now, just because we got
to deal with this mess,
don’t you ever forget
that being black
is an honor, because you
come from greatness.”
But the young kids who
played the scene in the film,
I didn’t rehearse with them.
I wanted them to be on
camera for the first time
experiencing that.
So what we do —
we’re seeing three
different kinds of dynamics
in this scene,
is understanding
the subtext of what an
African-American family go
through in the inner city.
We’re seeing a
father figure who
is very present
in the household.
And we’re seeing
a relationship
that shows a
loving relationship
between a husband and wife.
Even though they
have disagreements,
we still see a love.
“You understand?”
