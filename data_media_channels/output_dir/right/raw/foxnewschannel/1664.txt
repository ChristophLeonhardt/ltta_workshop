00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:08,780
>> Sean: WELCOME BACK TO

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,380
"HANNITY."

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,048
BREAKING NEWS.

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:11,816
ACCORDING TO A REPORT, THE DOJ

5
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:13,017
INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE ONE WE'VE

6
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:15,086
BEEN WAITING FOR HAS COMPLETED A

7
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:16,754
DRAFT OF A REPORT AS IT RELATES

8
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:19,090
TO THE HANDLING OF THE CLINTON

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,191
E-MAIL INVESTIGATION.

10
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,293
HERE TO REACTION, OHIO

11
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:24,429
CONGRESSMAN, JIM JORDAN, RON

12
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,965
DESANTIS AND ALSO WITH US, SARAH

13
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:29,367
CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

14
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,536
SARAH, LET'S TALK TO YOU FIRST.

15
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,037
WE KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME IN

16
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:35,506
MAY OR APRIL, BUT THEY FOUND NEW

17
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:37,308
INFORMATION AS RELATES TO THIS.

18
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:38,977
NEW EVIDENCE AND THE NEW TRAIL.

19
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:40,244
WHERE ARE WE WITH THIS?

20
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:41,813
>> LOOKS LIKE IT'S WRAPPED UP.

21
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:43,982
WE WERE EXPECTING IT TO WRAP UP

22
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:44,882
IN MAY.

23
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:46,517
THEY EXTENDED THAT BECAUSE THEY

24
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,419
FOUND NEW INFORMATION AND IT'S

25
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:50,521
GOING TO BE IMPERATIVE FOR THE

26
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,256
INSPECTOR GENERAL HOROWITZ TO

27
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,391
GET ALL OF THAT INFORMATION INTO

28
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,226
THIS REPORT, WHICH I BELIEVE HE

29
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:55,493
DID.

30
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:56,828
NOW HE WILL BE RELEASING.

31
00:00:56,828 --> 00:00:59,697
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY

32
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:00,064
IMPORTANT.

33
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:01,165
THIS IS PART OF WHAT CONGRESS

34
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,368
HAS BEEN ASKING FOR ALL ALONG.

35
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:04,402
REMEMBER, IT'S THE INSPECTOR

36
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:07,705
GENERAL THAT HAS ALL OF THE

37
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:08,139
DOCUMENTATION.

38
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:10,575
THE 1.2 MILLION PIECES OF

39
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:11,776
DOCUMENTATION THAT CONGRESS HAS

40
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,711
BEEN PRACTICALLY BEGGING FOR AND

41
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:17,815
PUSHING AND THREATENING WITH

42
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:19,083
SUBPOENAS, THE DOJ AND THE FBI.

43
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:23,287
SO THIS REPORT IS VERY

44
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:23,688
IMPORTANT.

45
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:25,323
>> Sean: ON TOP OF THE LETTER

46
00:01:25,323 --> 00:01:27,892
THAT BOTH OF YOU, RON DESANTIS

47
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:29,827
AND MARK MEADOWS WHO IS NOT WITH

48
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:31,195
US HAVE PUT OUT SAYING

49
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:33,031
MR. PRESIDENT, GET INVOLVED, YOU

50
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,365
HAVE TO TELL THE ATTORNEY

51
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:36,534
GENERAL AND YOU HAVE THE POWER

52
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:39,871
TO DO SO, 01.2 MILLION DOCUMENTS

53
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,106
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

54
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,975
WE KNOW WITH THE LITTLE BIT

55
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:46,377
WE'VE GOTTEN, WE ONLY HAVE A FEW

56
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:48,212
OF THE STRZOK PAGE MEMOS TO

57
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:48,846
BEGIN WITH.

58
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:49,580
>> RIGHT.

59
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,415
COUPLE OF THINGS.

60
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,983
FIRST TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

61
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:54,285
REPORT, IT WAS MICHAEL HOROWITZ

62
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,788
THAT UNCOVERED THE PAGE-STRZOK

63
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:58,156
TEXTS WHERE WE LEARNED SO MUCH

64
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:58,556
INFORMATION.

65
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:00,158
IT WAS MICHAEL HOROWITZ AND HIS

66
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:03,361
TEAM THAT DETERMINED THAT ANDY

67
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,331
McCABE HAD MISLEAD PEOPLE UNDER

68
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:07,632
OATH.

69
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:08,833
SO WE'RE ALL WAITING FOR THIS

70
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:09,167
REPORT.

71
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,868
IF IT'S A DRAFT, THERE WILL BE

72
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:12,503
SOME REVIEWS THAT HAVE TO TAKE

73
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:12,804
PLACE.

74
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:14,238
THAT'S GOOD NEWS THAT WE'LL GET

75
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:14,939
THAT SOON.

76
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,608
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE LETTER

77
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:18,276
THAT WE SENT.

78
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:19,444
WE'RE TIRED OF THE RUN AROUND

79
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,878
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

80
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:22,380
IT'S TIME TO TURN OVER THE

81
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,780
INFORMATION.

82
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,848
THE ONE WAY WE KNOW THAT CAN

83
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,683
HAPPEN IS FOR THE HEAD OF THE

84
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,618
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE PRESIDENT

85
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,587
OF THE UNITED STATES TO TELL THE

86
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:31,089
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THE DEPUTY

87
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:33,257
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE FBI

88
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:34,292
DIRECTOR, GIVE CONGRESS A

89
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,359
SEPARATE AND EQUAL --

90
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,261
>> Sean: AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT.

91
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:37,762
>> YES.

92
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:39,630
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE

93
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,364
PRESIDENT TO DO.

94
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:43,134
>> Sean: RON DESANTIS, THIS IS A

95
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:44,902
KEY POINT.

96
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:47,338
AGAIN, WE ONLY GOT A SMALL

97
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,140
SAMPLING OF THE STRZOK-PAGE

98
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,742
MEMOS AND IT'S SO REVEALING,

99
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:53,377
INSURANCE POLICIES, HOW MUCH

100
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,146
THEY HATE TRUMP, HOW STRZOK IS

101
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:58,116
INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING.

102
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:00,218
LITERALLY INTERVIEWS HILLARY.

103
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,820
SHE'S EXONERATED.

104
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,057
WRITING IT BEFORE HE INTERVIEWED

105
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:06,390
HILLARY.

106
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,627
A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY EXONERATE,

107
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:11,062
RIG AN INVESTIGATION INTO HER,

108
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,797
THEY'RE INVESTIGATING DONALD

109
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:13,097
TRUMP.

110
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:13,898
THE TIMING OF THE GEORGE

111
00:03:13,898 --> 00:03:15,967
PAPADOPOULOS STORY IS BLOWING UP

112
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:16,701
IN THEIR FACE?

113
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:18,536
>> THAT'S WHY, SEAN, THE

114
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:20,638
COMBINATION OF THE I.G. REPORT

115
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,073
HITTING HOPEFULLY VERY SOON AND

116
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:23,674
THEN IF THE PRESIDENT PULLS THE

117
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:26,043
TRIGGER ON ALL OF THIS OTHER

118
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:27,578
INFORMATION, WE COULD HAVE THE

119
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:29,080
GUSHER OF INFORMATION THAT

120
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,182
PROVIDES ALL OF THE CLARITY THAT

121
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:32,550
WE'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT ALL

122
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,584
THESE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.

123
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:36,053
YEAH, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

124
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:36,420
BEGINNING.

125
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,089
HOW DID THIS RUSSIA PROBE START.

126
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,056
VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

127
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:41,025
EVEN THINGS GOING UP INTO THE

128
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,059
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

129
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,362
I MEAN, ROSENSTEIN WRITES AN

130
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:46,330
APPOINTING ORDER APPOINTING

131
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,664
MUELLER.

132
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:48,366
THE THING IS DEFECTIVE ON ITS

133
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:48,666
FACE.

134
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,601
HE WRITES A SECRET ADDENDUM, A

135
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:53,871
NEW APPOINTING ORDER AND THEN

136
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:57,008
THEY REDACTED MOST OF IT.

137
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:58,976
>> Sean: AND THIS IS AFTER THEY

138
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,611
RAIDED MANAFORT'S HOME.

139
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:03,181
THE TIMING IS BACKWARDS THAT

140
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,950
SHOWS CORRUPTION.

141
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,452
AND ROSENSTEIN SIGNING OFF ON

142
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:11,155
THE RIDICULOUS FISA APPLICATION

143
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:11,889
RENEWAL.

144
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,525
SARAH, HERE'S A BIG QUESTION.

145
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:17,829
I KNOW THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DID

146
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,430
RELEASE SOME OF THE STRZOK PAGE

147
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,363
TEXT MESSAGES.

148
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:21,464
SO REVEALING.

149
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,967
I DON'T KNOW MICHAEL HOROWITZ.

150
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:25,837
I KNOW HE'S APPOINTED BY OBAMA.

151
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,405
WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE HE'S GOING

152
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,506
TO DO THEIR JOB?

153
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:30,508
THE EVIDENCE ABOUT HILLARY AND

154
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:32,777
COMMITTING FELONIES AND

155
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:34,645
OBSTRUCTING IS OVERWHELMING.

156
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,247
ANY AMERICAN WOULD GET

157
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:36,614
CONVICTED.

158
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,583
THE FACT THAT THEY EXONERATED

159
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,752
HER, IT'S OVERWHELMING AND

160
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:42,253
INCONTROVERTIBLE.

161
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:43,287
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE'LL GET

162
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:44,355
THE TRUTH FROM HIM?

163
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:45,590
>> I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS

164
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,192
HERE THAT ARE VERY REVEALING.

165
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:49,760
ONE, LET ME START WITH YOUR

166
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,028
QUESTION, EVERYONE THAT I'VE

167
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:52,730
SPOKEN WITH, EVERY SOURCE SAID I

168
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,966
KNOW WHO KNOWS MICHAEL HOROWITZ

169
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,735
SAYS THIS MAN IS HONOR, WILL

170
00:04:57,735 --> 00:04:58,603
STICK TO HIS GUNS.

171
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,404
HE WILL BE STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH

172
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:01,239
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

173
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:03,207
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THAT

174
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:04,242
ABOUT MUELLER.

175
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:05,109
>> NO.

176
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:07,144
WE SAW THAT WITH THE McCABE

177
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:07,478
REPORT.

178
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:08,512
HE WENT AFTER THIS ONE.

179
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:11,816
HE'S GOING TO GO AFTER COMEY,

180
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,652
LORETTA LYNCH IN THE TARMAC

181
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:15,019
MEETING.

182
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,921
>> Sean: STRZOK AND PAGE.

183
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:17,288
>> YES.

184
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,022
>> Sean: AND BRUCE OHR.

185
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:19,056
>> ABSOLUTELY, SEAN.

186
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,726
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE

187
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,327
TIMING OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

188
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,628
STORY.

189
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,395
CROSS FIRE HURRICANE.

190
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:26,530
THEY KNEW, THE DOJ AS WELL AS

191
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,099
THE FBI, THAT THIS REPORT WAS

192
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:29,567
GOING TO COME OUT.

193
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,169
LOOK, CAME OUT TONIGHT.

194
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:32,470
RIGHT?

195
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,273
SO THEY NEEDED TO CYA AND THEY

196
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:36,874
WENT STRAIGHT TO "THE NEW YORK

197
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:37,642
TIMES" AND TRIED TO TELL THEIR

198
00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:40,344
SIDE OF THE STORY, A LIMITED

199
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:40,645
SIDE.

200
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,445
>> Sean: "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

201
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:45,082
WILL TRY TO JUSTIFY AND MAKE

202
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:45,516
EXCUSES.

203
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,385
ALL THEY DID IS CONFIRM

204
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:48,352
EVERYTHING YOU'VE REPORTED AND

205
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:49,520
THE SHOW HAS REPORTED.

206
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,688
>> THEY CONFIRMED EVERYTHING

207
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,490
THAT'S BEEN REPORTED, THAT WE

208
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,558
REPORTED AND THEY ALSO GAVE AWAY

209
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:55,960
SOME INFORMATION.

210
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,995
THEY TALKED ABOUT AT LEAST ONE

211
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,330
MOLE, ONE

212
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,697
RIGHT?

213
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,132
>> Sean: RIGHT.

214
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:02,300
>> THAT MEANS THAT --

215
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,302
>> Sean: YOU'LL HAVE A BIG STORY

216
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:07,138
ON THE FBI INFORMANT THAT WAS IN

217
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:09,674
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, RIGHT?

218
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,175
AM I JUMPING THE GUN HERE?

219
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,710
I'M JUMPING THE GUN.

220
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,278
>> YOU MIGHT NOT BE.

221
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:15,212
>> Sean: WE SHOULD WE HAVE

222
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:17,281
FAITH -- GREAT WORK, BY THE WAY.

223
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:20,651
WHY SHOULD WE HAVE FAITH,

224
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,019
CONGRESSMAN?

225
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,855
SAME QUESTION, IN MICHAEL

226
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:25,222
HOROWITZ.

227
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:27,058
>> HE'S THE ONE THAT DID TELL US

228
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,560
WHAT ANDY McCABE WAS UP TO AND

229
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,562
UNCOVERED THE PAGE-STRZOK

230
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,929
MESSAGES.

231
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:32,463
THAT'S GOOD.

232
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,864
COMEY HAS BEEN FIRED.

233
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:36,734
WE'LL GET INFORMATION ABOUT THAT

234
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,870
IN THIS REPORT.

235
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,039
ANDREW McCABE FIRED.

236
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,040
WE'LL HAVE MORE ANSWERS.

237
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,443
WE WANT TO KNOW WHY PETER STRZOK

238
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:46,544
IS THERE.

239
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:49,046
A LOT OF THOSE THINGS THAT WELL

240
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:49,747
GET ANSWERS TO.

241
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:50,681
>> Sean: LAST WORD.

242
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,849
>> TRUST BY VERIFY.

243
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,484
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT

244
00:06:53,484 --> 00:00:00,000
RELEASES THESE DOCUMENTS, WE CAN
