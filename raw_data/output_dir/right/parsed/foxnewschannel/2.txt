AROUND.
WELCOME TO FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.
I AM SHANNON BREAM IN
WASHINGTON.
WE BEGIN WITH JACKIE LIVE IN NEW
YORK CITY WITH REPORTS OF
ANOTHER SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE
SURFACED.
GOOD EVENING, JACKIE.
>> GOOD EVENING, A SECOND DAY OF
EVACUATIONS HERE AT THE TIME
WARNER CENTER AFTER PACKAGES
PROMPTED A BOMB SQUAD RESPONSE.
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.
THIS BUILDING HOUSES CNN.
AFTER A LIVE EXPLOSIVE WAS FOUND
IN THEIR MAIL ROOM POLICE MADE
SURE THERE WAS NOT A REPEAT
INCIDENT.
4 OF THE 10 MAIL BOMBS WERE
FOUND IN NEW YORK.
THE LATEST TODAY AT THE
PRODUCTION OFFICE OF ROBERT DE
NIRO.
2 MORE TO JOE BIDEN'S OFFICE IN
DELAWARE.
NONE OF THE 3 REACHING THEIR
TARGET.
BECAUSE THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS
NO WAY TO SCREEN EVERY PACKAGE.
THEY'RE REVIEWING IMAGES FROM
WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE PACKAGES
WERE PROCESSED.
>> WE HAVE THE EMPLOYEES LOOKING
FOR THESE PACKAGES.
>> INVESTIGATORS HONED IN ON NEW
YORK AND FLORIDA.
ALL 10 BOMBS BEING DISSECTED IN
QUANTICO WHERE INVESTIGATORS ARE
SCANNING FOR DNA AND
FINGERPRINTS AND SIMILARITIES IN
HOW THEY WERE BUILT.
QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT HOW MANY
WERE OPERATIONAL AND THE POWERED
PACKED IN.
IT PROVED NOT TO BE DANGEROUS,
THE BOMB WAS LIVE.
INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE ALL 10
BOMBS CAME FROM THE SAME SENDER.
IN NEW YORK AND ACROSS THE
COUNTRY A SEARCH FOR A TERRORIST
CHARGES ON.
>> CLEARLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN
THE LAST FEW DAYS IS AN ATTACK
ON THE MEDIA OUTLETS AND
PROMINENT PUBLIC FIGURES.
WE WILL MAKE SURE THERE IS AN
EXPANDED PRESENCE AS LONG AS WE
NEED IT TO SHOW VERY VIVIDLY
THAT NEW YORK CITY TAKES THESE
ISSUES SERIOUSLY.
>> ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE BOMBS
TODAY REACHED RECIPIENTS.
MANY WERE HANDLED BY CIVILIANS.
