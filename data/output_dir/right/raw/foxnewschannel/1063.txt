>>> THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR PAIN

2
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:12,061
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO

3
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,497
PURGE IT FROM YOUR SOUL.

4
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:17,132
YOUR LIFE MATTERS TO EVERYONE

5
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:18,867
WHO LOVES YOU, EVERYONE WHO

00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,703
CARES ABOUT YOU AND PEOPLE YOU

>> Martha: KEVIN HEINZ

9
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:24,339
JUMPED OFF THE GOLDEN STATE

10
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,874
BRIDGE AND SURVIVED.

11
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:27,810
IT WAS THE WORST AND THE BEST

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,577
DAY OF HIS LIFE.

13
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:30,212
HE SAID THE MINUTE HE JUMPED

14
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:32,147
HE DEEPLY REGRETTED WHAT HE

15
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:32,581
HAD DONE.

16
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,350
AND HE SAYS A VAST MAJORITY OF

17
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,885
SURVIVORS SAY THE SAME THING.

18
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:39,555
HE IS ON A MISSION TO STOP AND

19
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:41,023
TO SAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS HE

20
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:41,356
CAN.

21
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:44,259
HE JOINS US IN A MOMENT WITH

22
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,361
HIS IMPORTANT STORY.

23
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,797
IT COMES DURING A SHOCKING

24
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:50,299
WEEK AS WE HAVE LOST TWO

25
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,268
BRIGHT LIGHTS.

26
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:55,170
DESIGNER KATE SPADE AT 55.

27

AT THE AGE OF 61.

30
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,781
A NEW REPORT FROM THE C.D.C.

31
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:07,883
SHOWS SUICIDE RATES WENT UP

32
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:14,256
29% SINCE 1999.

33
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:15,758
HERE NOW TO SHARE HIS STORY

34
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,260
WITH US IS KEVIN HEINZ.

35
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,895
KEVIN, GOOD EVENING.

36
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:24,666
THANK YOU FORKING FOR BEING HER.

37
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,169
YOU JUMPED AND YET YOU

38
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:27,936
SURVIVED.

39
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:28,537
HOW?

40
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:29,705
>> Kevin: I DID.

41
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:31,673
I ATTEMPTED TO TAKE MY LIFE IN

42
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:34,076
A WAY THAT IS 99% FATAL.

43
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:35,978
OVER 3,000 PEOPLE HAVE LIKELY

44
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:37,279
DIED OFF THE GOLDEN GATE

45
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:37,746
BRIDGE.

46
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:39,381
I'M ONE OF 36 WHO HAVE BEEN

47
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,616
GIVEN THE GIFT OF A SECOND

48
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:46,088
CHANCE TO SURVIVE.

49
00:01:46,088 --> 00:01:47,823
I BELIEVE SUICIDE IS THE SAME

50
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:49,091
THING AS LETHAL, EMOTIONAL

51
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:49,424
PAIN.

52
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:50,993
A PAIN SO GREAT THAT LEAVES

53
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:53,095
YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE WORTHLESS,

54
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:55,197
LESS THAN AND HAVE NO VALUE

55
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:57,299
AND YOU ARE A BURDEN TO THOSE

56
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,367
YOU LOVE YOU.

57
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,268
THOSE ARE ALL FALSE.

58
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:00,736
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, YOU ARE

59
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:02,304
ENOUGH, YOU MATTER.

60
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:03,272
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T

61
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,640
RECOGNIZE INSIDE THE PAIN.

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,240
>> Martha: THE MOST

63
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,309
IMPORTANT MESSAGES YOU COULD

64
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:08,610
TELL ANYBODY WHO IS FEELING

65
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,745
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU

66
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:10,779
ARE FEELING.

67
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:16,451
TELL EVERYBODY AT HOME WHAT

68
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,486
HAPPENED, THAT INTERVENED IN

69
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:19,087
YOUR ATTEMPT TO TAKE YOUR OWN

70
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:20,155
LIFE THAT LEFT YOU ABLE TO

71
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:22,057
STAND HERE TODAY AND TALK TO

72
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:27,696
SO MANY OTHERS.

73
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:29,231
>> OF THE 36 SURVIVORS.

74
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,200
FIVE OF US HAVE REGAINED FULL

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,567
MOBILITY.

76
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,935
THE ABILITY TO WALK, RUN AND

77
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:33,302
STRIDE.

78
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,436
THAT IS A GIFT IN ITSELF.

79
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,004
I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I

80
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:39,107
ATTEMPTED TO TAKE MY LIFE, THE

81
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:41,910
MILLISECONDS MY HAND LEFT THE

82
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,915
RAIL, IT WAS INSTANT REGRET.

83
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:48,917
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SAY THE

84
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:51,220
MINUTE AFTER THEY MADE THE

85
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,255
ATTEMPT ALL THEY WANTED TO DO

86
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:54,456
IS LIVE.

87
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:55,357
PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNIZE

88
00:02:55,357 --> 00:02:59,928
THOUGHTS DON'T HAVE TO BE

89
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:01,096
ACTIONS.

90
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,031
IF WE RECOGNIZE OUR THOUGHTS

91
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:05,300
DON'T OWN US OR DEFINE US.

92
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,902
WE CAN STAY HERE.

93
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,837
I LIVE WITH SUICIDAL THOUGHTS.

94
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:09,404
THEY PLAGUE ME.

95
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:11,006
BUT I WILL NOT DIE THAT WAY.

96
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,374
BECAUSE WHEN THEY OCCUR I WILL

97
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:15,410
TURN TO THE NEXT PERSON AND

98
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,045
SAY "I NEED HELP NOW."

99
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:18,347
I WILL SURVIVE THE PAIN.

100
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,082
BUT GIVEN THAT I ATTEMPTED AND

101
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:23,285
WHAT SAVED ME IN THE WATER I

102
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:25,520
FLAILED TO STAY AFLOAT AND I

103
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,122
COULDN'T STAY ABOVE WATER.

104
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,024
A SEA LION CAME TO MY AID AND

105
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:31,159
BUMPED ME UP UNTIL THE COAST

106
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,728
GUARD BOAT ARRIVED BEHIND ME.

107
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:33,762
THAT IS MY MIRACLE.

108
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,464
I GOT TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE A

109
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:36,999
CREATURE SAW ME IN DANGER AND

110
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:37,666
ACTED IMMEDIATELY.

111
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,234
THAT IS MY GUARDIAN ANGEL WHO

112
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:42,004
SAVED ME THAT DAY.

113
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:42,971
WITH THE COAST GUARD WHO

114
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,273
PULLED ME FROM THE DOCTOR AND

115
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:45,540
THE BACK DOCTOR THAT GAVE ME

116
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,642
THE ABILITY TO WALK AND RUN

117
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:47,175
AND STAND.

118
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:48,243
>> Martha: I KNOW YOU SAID

119
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:49,311
HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ON

120
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:50,412
THAT DAY AND HE WAS.

121
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:51,947
YOU HAD A CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS

122
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:52,547
THAT SAVED YOU.

123
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:54,149
I LOVE THE SEA LION PART OF

124
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,516
THE STORY.

125
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:57,786
I CAN IMAGINE HIM COMING UP

126
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:00,822
UNDER THE WATER TO BOLSTER YOU

127
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:02,057
IN THE MOMENT WHEN YOU NEEDED

128
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,158
IT SO MUCH.

129
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,193
SO MANY ARE FEELING SO MUCH

130
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:06,929
FROM WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK

131
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:11,233

133
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:13,835
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM ABOUT

134
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,337
HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT WHEN WE

135
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:16,904
DON'T KNOW THE PERSON.

136
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:21,677
>> WE KNOW OF THEM.

137
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,778
WE ARE OBSESSED WITH THE

138
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:23,779

MUCH.

140
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:27,282
WHEN SOMEONE IN THIS HIGH PRO

FILE LIKE ANTHONY AND KATE

142
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,919
DIES BY THEIR HANDS, IT SENDS

143
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,723
A RIPPLE EFFECT AROUND THE

144
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:37,426
WORLD OF IMMEASURABLE PAIN.

145
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,827
WHEN WE ALLOW THAT TO DAMAGE

146
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:39,761
THE CHILDREN WE HAVE A

147
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,329
PROBLEM.

148
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,464
I'M SO SORRY TO THEIR FAMILY

BECOMES PERSONAL.

158
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,748
