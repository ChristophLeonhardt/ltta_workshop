00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,570
The United Nations recently held their climate
summit in New York City.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,420
A few days ahead of the event, more than 300,000
people joined a peaceful march in Manhattan

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,269
to call attention to the issue of climate
change.

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,400
Secretary Of State John Kerry recently argued
that the problem of climate change should

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,830
be addressed with the same immediacy as Ebola
or ISIS.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,609
So, putting politics aside, how serious is
this issue?

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,460
Well, there’s an incredible amount of statistical
evidence that illustrates the severity of

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,900
climate change.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,110
But instead of getting mired down in talk
about ice caps and polar bear populations,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,980
let’s just discuss what the UN Climate Summit
is really about: air pollution.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,000
The UN is meeting in hopes of signing a deal
that could cut down on carbon emissions worldwide.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,079
Just to be clear, we are talking about cars
and our dependence on oil, but we’re also

13
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,829
talking about things like coal power.

14
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,550
Climate change is a pressing issue now because
there are nations, chief among them China,

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,730
that are actively pumping carbon into the
environment on an enormous scale.

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,480
According to the Global Carbon Project, China
alone accounts for 28% of the world’s total

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,750
carbon emissions.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,570
And they increased their emissions last year
by 4.2%, which increased global emissions

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,450
worldwide, by 2.3%.

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,930
In other words, year over year - the situation
is getting worse, not better.

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,690
The ultimate goal of this meeting is to establish
a plan to reduce these emissions.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,140
And one way to do that - is switching away
from coal and fossil fuels, to cleaner forms

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,150
of energy; a switch that some economists and
ecologists now argue could also help developing

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,110
countries, like China, save money in the long
run.

25
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,140
They also argue that it would benefit not
just the environment, but also the health

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,100
of the people in those nations.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,220
The argument against committing to cleaner
energy is that it requires an enormous initial

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,720
investment and could potentially slow down
economic progress.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,360
The problem is that the very nations that
need economic progress most, are also the

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,350
nations that emit the most carbon.

31
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,660
It’s a catch-22, and a large part of why
an agreement still hasn’t been reached.

32
