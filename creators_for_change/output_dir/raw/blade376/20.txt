hey everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope all is well I've</font>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,950
recently been working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my new website</font>

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,980
and upon designing the main page it made

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,660
me have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard thing about a</font>

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,179
tagline<font color="#CCCCCC"> that catches my life's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mission</font>

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,340
statement and what did I come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the quest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for global empathy and so in</font>

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,619
today's video I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,960
my life's philosophy many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I</font>

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,240
read a brilliant book by Jeremy Rifkin

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,090
called the empathic civilization which

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,580
looks at the nature of empathy in both a

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,219
scientific and historical context to

14
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">summarize the latter when we look back</font>

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,860
as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as hunter-gatherer societies</font>

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,120
communication could only extend as far

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,460
as they could speak meaning empathy

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,739
tended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> only occur within the confines</font>

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,020
of their own tribes then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,450
hydraulic agricultural civilizations

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,610
we're reading and writing extended our

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,250
means of communication we became<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,070
tribal eyes in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways as a result our</font>

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,230
consciousness was no longer entirely

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,870
focused around blood<font color="#E5E5E5"> ties but around</font>

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,270
theological belief systems religious

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,090
ties I mean Jews would find it easier to

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,310
empathize with other Jews Muslims with

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,930
other Muslims Christians with other

30
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,869
Christians etc etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we move on</font>

31
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Industrial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Revolution where the</font>

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,890
development of markets and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the creation</font>

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of nation-states allowed for empathy to</font>

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,740
transcend blood and religious ties it

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,799
could now occur across nationalities and

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,470
so Jeremy Rifkin the author of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> book</font>

37
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,500
asks if the evolution of empathy has

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,079
come this far already why can't we take

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,810
it a step further this book really spoke

40
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,119
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I previously had similar</font>

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,950
thoughts but coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this from a</font>

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,290
different perspective with my many

43
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,420
surreal years of experience using

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,070
YouTube as a vehicle for social change

45
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,829
and in the process seeing how this

46
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,200
technology could be used to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,299
together from all walks of life I

48
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,100
believe we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incredible</font>

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity to achieve global empathy</font>

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,170
but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stepping stone we</font>

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,360
have to cross before we get there

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
firstly I'd like you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> human being on this planet is a</font>

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,640
dot throughout history these dots have

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,180
connected with one another

56
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,939
through communication as these dots join

57
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,930
up they create clouds of culture

58
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,209
ideology belief systems language and

59
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,209
thus communities are born but different

60
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">clouds may collide with each other</font>

61
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,400
causing friction to occur and storms to

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
form over the past decade<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,290
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> sped up this process on an</font>

64
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,019
unprecedented scale individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> who once</font>

65
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:40,170
had thoughts or beliefs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem niche</font>

66
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,430
making them feel alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their local</font>

67
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,250
communities may now be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected with</font>

68
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,470
millions of like-minded people all over

69
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,780
the world this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has caused a perceived</font>

70
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,569
paradox to transpire whereas these

71
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,750
clouds of unity grow and develop so do

72
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,879
the lines of division that separate them

73
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,099
from each other it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been argued that</font>

74
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,620
the Internet has created echo chambers

75
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,750
where people only talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> those who</font>

76
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,180
think the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that they do when</font>

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,680
actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has only</font>

78
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,230
emphasized a phenomenon that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has already</font>

79
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,780
existed throughout human history we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

80
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,150
now just more aware of it and seeing

81
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,609
these clouds so huge can be an

82
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,699
intimidating sight that is why some

83
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,010
countries currently feel more divided on

84
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,019
political issues than they ever have

85
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,970
before when<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the history of</font>

86
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,669
human empathy there is one significant

87
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,729
factor that led to<font color="#CCCCCC"> its development</font>

88
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,590
communication which derives from

89
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,599
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

90
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,609
language is primarily used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

91
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:41,530
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other people when</font>

92
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,659
actually it can be argued that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

93
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,060
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of language takes place within</font>

94
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,000
our minds our inner monologue is how we

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,759
talk with ourselves and therefore create

96
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,310
thought and this is why language and

97
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,459
culture is so important it teaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

98
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,009
how to interpret our world from blood

99
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,349
ties to religious ties from religious

100
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,680
ties to nationalities I now believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,229
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a realm where empathy</font>

102
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:11,919
occurs between ideological ties and so

103
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,259
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to move from this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place to</font>

104
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,750
one of global consciousness we need to

105
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,120
take an honest look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the main factor</font>

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
which divides us language the language

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we speak and the language that we</font>

108
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,220
think I

109
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,340
we believe the following things one we

110
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,770
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all victims of circumstance number</font>

111
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,650
two a controversial one there is no such

112
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing as a bad person just bad actions</font>

113
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,220
bad decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bad occurrences that</font>

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,700
derive from circumstance<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just have</font>

115
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look far enough back in that person's</font>

116
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,220
timeline and finally three we have the

117
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,350
potential to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> unified as a human</font>

118
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,930
species when you consider the raw

119
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,360
fundamentals of what everybody on this

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,500
planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs things like love health</font>

121
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,340
nutrition mental well-being connection

122
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,190
and a sense of belonging<font color="#E5E5E5"> once I began to</font>

123
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,530
understand these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it became a lot</font>

124
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,650
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tolerance where</font>

125
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,750
I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with other people</font>

126
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,480
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> those I'm a fundamentally disagree</font>

127
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,970
with on so many levels this brings us to

128
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">what motivates me in the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do</font>

129
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,270
my activism primarily revolves around

130
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,630
value systems not telling people what to

131
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,300
think but instead pointing out ways of

132
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,450
thinking and so my main interest is not

133
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,490
changing the characteristics of each

134
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,090
individual dot but by finding ways of

135
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,610
connecting these dots together empathy

136
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,550
is a universal language and so by doing

137
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,650
what we can to create these connections

138
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,290
we stand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best possible chance of</font>

139
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,990
moving towards global consciousness

140
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,419
because as technology continues to

141
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,419
advance at an exponential rate if our

142
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,790
value systems as a human race don't

143
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,700
develop along with it conflicting clouds

144
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,100
could grow so large and unstable that

145
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the storms destroy us because we fail to</font>

146
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,740
find a way to connect this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

147
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,290
motivates<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in pretty much everything</font>

148
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do in life and it is effectively</font>

149
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,800
how I best describe the quest<font color="#CCCCCC"> for global</font>

150
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,320
empathy and so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

that very journey thank you very much I

look forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing your thoughts in</font>
