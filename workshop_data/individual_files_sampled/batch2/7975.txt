audio so Donald Trump was having a rally last night nobody knows why he's doing the rallies because we're not in the middle of a campaign certainly now for Trump but I don't mind the rallies I think president should do them more often I think Obama should have made his case way more often he was too reluctant do that okay so no problems there so they want to interview some of his supporters you're not gonna be surprised to find out some of them were harsh to say the least let's go to one of those right now God one Simon please care for the children well there's children wait if I get arrested my kids aren't gonna see me for a while either mocking little kids who were crying or I guess he was mocking people who care about little kids okay well at least we know what side you stand on they're not pretending to have empathy they're not pretending to care about other human beings they're not pretending to care about the kids in fact they mock anyone who does care about the kids now they're not the only ones he claims that the progressives are crying but even if that were true they're certainly not the only ones because they've had a trump supporter who was crying why were they crying she was so broken up about how Donald Trump is being mistreated watch family means a lot to us so we have to do it I see you getting emotional why is that because he tries so hard and somebody people myself down or not up yeah so many people are so down on him when he's working so hard working hard he hardly works when they asked him hey do you know anything about the Korean Peninsula before going to those peace negotiations he's like I don't have to know anything I've been studying my whole life I'm gonna know in the first minute it's all about attitude work he did this insane program where they take the kids away from the parents and they had no plan on how to reunite them right now some of the parents are being deported and and their kids are still in detention centers he doesn't know work at all he's famous for not wanting to do any work his own staffers tell the reporters that hey we had to bring all the briefings down to one page because he cannot read four pages and even in the one page we have to show him pictures and and we have to keep putting Trump in there so that he'll pay attention he worked so hard are you kidding me that's what you're broken up about you're not broken up about the kids but you're broken up about Donald Trump working so hard but not getting credit for it now but it's not surprising cuz he can get his followers to believe anything later in this same rally he's gonna say something that is unbelievable he's gonna say it about the elites now I want you to remember how he ran his campaign he ran his campaign against the elites in case you don't remember here's Donald Trump during the campaign if we're going to deliver real change we're going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations media elites and political dynasties I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who led us from one financial and foreign policy disaster to another our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy politics and borders I was on the right side of that issue as you know with the people I was there I said it was going to happen I felt it well Hillary as always stood with the elites and both she and President Obama predicted that one and many others totally wrong so several times he attacks the elites the we need independence from the elites hillarious Lee also attacked powerful corporations now all he ever does is serve powerful corporations but hold I'm gonna get back to that rally in a second but I want you to remember that this was such an important scene for him that he even put it in his paid advertising listen to what he says about the elites in this ad our movie is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you the American people the establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election for those who control the levers of power in Washington for the global special interest they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind the political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry the establishment and the elite have bled us dry he talked often about the global financial elite now he turns around in the rally last night and says this never noticed they always call the other side and they do this up but the elite the elite why are they elite I have a much better apartment than they do I'm smarter than they are I'm richer than they are I became president and they didn't and I'm representing the greatest smartest most loyal best people on earth the deplorable remember that he now turns around says he's the elite and the crowd roars he ran the whole campaign against the establishment and the elite and that's why you voted for him and now you turn around yeah he's morally it's morally he's got a better apartment I'm rooting for the guy who's for the elites what what just happened he's working so hard to break all my money but it is owed pocket but people won't give him credit he just bragged about being in the elites but he can get his followers to believe anything so now congratulations
