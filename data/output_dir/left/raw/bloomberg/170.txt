1
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:09,809
SCARLET: WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:10,977
FROM THE CLOSING BELL.

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,847
I AM SCARLET FU.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,849
JOEL: I'M JOE WEISENTHAL.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,020
OLIVER: AND I AM OLIVER RUNNING

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,487
-- OLIVER.

7
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:26,326
SCARLET: ALL THREE INDEXES

8
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,928
FINISHING A NEW HIGHS.

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:36,302
WE TALK ABOUT WHY THE SECOND

10
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,036
INNING OF BREXIT MAY BE WORSE

11
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,140
THAN THE FIRST.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,513
>> PLUS, JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER

13
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,413
-- JAPAN'S EMPEROR MAY WANT TO

14
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:47,814
RETIRE.

15
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,251
WE LOOK AT HOW THIS COULD AFFECT

16
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:51,818
THE PRIME MINISTER.

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,288
OLIVER: AND WE HAVE THE CHARTS

18
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:55,855
YOU CANNOT MISS.

19
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,092
SCARLET: ALL THREE BENCHMARK

20
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,793
INDEXES CLOSING AT RECORD HIGHS

21
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,062
YET AGAIN.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,096
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER RECORD.

23
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,865
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VOLUME,

24
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,835
TRADING ON THE DOW AND S&P WERE

25
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,236
A DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGES BELOW

26
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:10,670
AVERAGE.

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,006
IT IS MID-AUGUST, AFTER ALL, AND

28
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,040
EARNINGS SEASON IS A SICKLY

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,407
OVER.

30
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,243
EVERYONE IS -- IS BASICALLY

31
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,213
OVER.

32
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:24,851
OLIVER: I WILL POINT OUT THAT IF

33
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,886
YOU LOOK AT THE VALUE OF STOCKS,

34
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,788
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO LOOK

35
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,556
AT VOLUME, AND THE TOTAL VALUE

36
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:31,057
IS PRETTY HIGH.

37
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:36,329
JOE: TODAY, WE SAW SAFETY AREAS

38
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,432
OF THE MARKET LAG WHILE SOME

39
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,233
RISKIER AREAS ARE DOING PRETTY

40
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:40,566
WELL.

41
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:44,604
OLIVER: I'M GOING TO JUMP IN AND

42
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,305
TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO SOME

43
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,908
MARKET MINUTES.

44
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:49,709
S&P IS PRETTY INTERESTING.

45
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,345
WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY HAD A BIG

46
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,112
SHIFT IN THE PAST COUPLE OF

47
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,414
WEEKS.

48
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,417
THESE THREE SECTORS DOING WELL

49
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,320
TODAY, MATERIALS, INDUSTRIALS,

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,720
ENERGY.

51
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,456
THEY ARE ON A REBOUND AFTER NOT

52
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:03,990
DOING SO WELL.

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,724
STRENGTHEN OIL AFTER A BEAR

54
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,461
MARKET RECENTLY.

55
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,729
WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME SECTORS

56
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,432
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DOING WELL.

57
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,668
THIS IS YEAR TO DATE FOR

58
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,369
UTILITIES AND TELECOM.

59
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,205
STILL VERY FAR UP, BUT HURTING

60
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,440
TODAY, HURTING RECENTLY.

61
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,276
WE WILL SEE HOW THAT CHANGES AS

62
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,579
WE GO INTO SEPTEMBER.

63
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:31,184
FINALLY, AS WE JUST POINTED OUT,

64
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,685
THIS IS INCREDIBLE, THE

65
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,522
FIVE-YEAR LOOK AT THE NASDAQ.

66
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,623
THIS IS THE LAST ONE TO CROSS

67
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,459
THE ALL-TIME HIGH RECENTLY.

68
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,594
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER HIGH.

69
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:46,666
JOE: HERE IS THE U.S. 10 YEAR

70
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:54,140
YIELD, DOWN A LITTLE BIT TODAY,

71
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,742
UP ON THE DAY, BUT LOW IN THE

72
00:02:55,742 --> 00:03:00,112
GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS.

73
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:01,948
ONE MARKET WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

74
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,784
OFTEN IS THE CHINESE SOVEREIGN

75
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,253
BOND MARKET.

76
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,222
THERE IS A NEW LOW ON THE 10

77
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:13,426
YEAR BOND THERE.

78
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,762
THIS IS FOR A LOT OF THE SAME

79
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,463
REASONS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

80
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,901
EVERYWHERE, SLOW GROWTH,

81
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,735
INFLATION, THE REACH FOR SAFETY.

82
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:27,273
SCARLET: THIS IS SLOW FOR CHINA

83
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,276
IN TERMS OF GROWTH.

84
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,713
I AM TAKING A LOOK AT AUSSIE

85
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:39,051
CURRENCY, REBUILDING MOMENTUM

86
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:42,622
AFTER HIGHS OF LAST WEEK.

87
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,258
ALSO, THE BRITISH POUND IS AT A

88
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,659
FRESH 30 YEAR LOW.

89
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,361
IT HAS DIPPED BELOW 129.

90
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:55,668
EARLIER, IT DIPPED BELOW 128.

91
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,471
WE WILL GET THE FIRST HEARD DATA

92
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,672
ON THE ECONOMY AFTER THE BREXIT

93
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,775
VOTE -- HARD DATA ON THE ECONOMY

94
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,744
AFTER THE BREXIT VOTE IN THE

95
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,244
COMING DAYS.

96
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:05,812
PEOPLE ARE BEARISH.

97
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:12,985
JOE: OIL HAD ANOTHER NICE UPDATE

98
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:13,386
TODAY.

99
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,153
IT WAS BELOW $40 A BARREL AT THE

100
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,622
BEGINNING OF AUGUST, AROUND

101
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,322
AUGUST 2, AND EVERYONE WAS

102
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:19,759
TURNING NEGATIVE.

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,829
IT HAS COME BACK NICELY.

104
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,463
ONCE AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE

105
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:23,930

106
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,900
SCARLET: THAT HAS HELPED THE

107
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,969
COMMODITY CURRENCIES AS WELL.

108
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,736
THOSE ARE TODAY'S MARKET

109
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:31,103

00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,457
THE WHITE LINE IS THE FORWARD PE

117
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,059

00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,177
THE BOTTOM PANEL IS A RELATIVE

124
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,246
VALUATION, THE SPREAD BETWEEN

125
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:13,713

126
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,848
IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE ARE

THE LINE AT THE BOTTOM IS THE

142
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,414
NORTHEAST.

143
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,118
THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING

144
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,019
HERE,TO BUILD HOMES.

145
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,886
IT IS EITHER TOO HOT OR TOO COLD

OLIVER: INTERESTING.

151
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,236
I AM NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE

152
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,038

00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,651
MARKETS INSIDE BULL MARKETS.

159
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,354
IN MAY OF 2015, WE SET THE HIGH.

160
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,022
WE SET A NEW HIGH IN JULY.

161
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,059

THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT LOST

169
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,217

171
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,690
THE ONLY TIME THAT LOOKED

173
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,393
GO INTO A BEAR MARKET IN 2011.

174
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,730

SAME DIRECTION?

191
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,500
>> IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IN THE

192
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,969
LAST MONTH, EVERY CLIENT I HAVE

193
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,005
SPOKEN TO, EXCEPT FOR THE RISK

194
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:53,939
PARITY GUYS, IS TELLING ME THIS

195
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,043
HAS BEEN A DISASTER YEAR.

196
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,413
MOST INVESTORS ARE HAVING A VERY

197
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,816
DIFFICULT YEAR EXCEPT FOR RISK

198
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,283
PARITY GUYS.

199
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,818
THE GUYS AT BRIDGEWATER, THE

200
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,086
GUYS WHO ARE RUNNING SYSTEMATIC

201
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,855
STRATEGY BASED ON THE IDEA OF

202
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:10,423
RISK PARITY.

203
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,257
THEY ARE KILLING IT THIS YEAR.

204
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,995
JOE: THIS IS A CHART OF BANK OF

205
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,363
AMERICA MULTI-ASSET STRATEGY

206
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,130
GOING BACK FIVE YEARS.

207
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,399
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT HAS BEEN A

208
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,334
ROCKET SHIP.

209
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,203
>> EXACTLY.

210
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,439
TYPICALLY, THESE PORTFOLIOS ARE

211
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,207
LONG TREASURIES, LONG STOCKS.

212
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,210
THE ONLY SITUATION IN WHICH

213
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,311
STOCKS AND BONDS ARE GOING TO DO

214
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:37,616
WELL IS DURING A PHASE OF

215
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,285
MONETARY EASING.

216
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:43,289
THEY FED IS GOING TO REMOVE

217
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,123
ACCOMMODATION GRADUALLY BUT THE

218
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,258
U.S. IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

219
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,893
IMPORT QE FROM JAPAN AND EUROPE.

220
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,262
THAT IS WHAT IS SO STRIKING.

221
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,297
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC

222
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,967
FINANCIAL INDEX, WE HAVE SEEN A

223
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,136
DRAMATIC EASING OF THE INDEX

224
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:57,636
SINCE BREXIT.

225
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,371
WE HAVE STARTED TO PICK UP DATA

226
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,306
IN THE U.S. THAT THE BEST WAY TO

227
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:05,778
BE POSITIONED IN THE SECOND HALF

228
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,579
OF THE YEAR IS MORE MONETARY

229
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:06,979
EASING.

230
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,583
OLIVER: WE TALK ABOUT THE FED

231
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,384
MODEL THAT SAYS THAT EQUITY

232
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:16,655
YIELD AND BOND YIELDS SHOULD BE

233
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:17,456
CLOSER THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.

234
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,360
THEY COULD BOTH LOSE VALUE

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,430
TOGETHER.

236
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,732
INVESTORS HAVE EXPOSURE TO BOTH.

237
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,566
COULD THEY GET HIT HARDER GOING

238
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:30,236
INTO THE SECOND HALF OR IS THERE

239
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:35,441
A SHIFT?

240
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,276
>> THE LAST TIME WE SAW

241
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:45,017
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS 2012.

242
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,586
2013, WE HAD THE WHOLE THING

243
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,156
THAT REALLY FETCHING'S UP --

244
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,893
REALLY SHOOK THINGS UP.

245
00:09:53,893 --> 00:10:00,132
NOW, OF COURSE, YOU COULD SAY

246
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,767
THAT GOING INTO JACKSON HOLE,

247
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,568
RIGHT NOW, THE MARKET IS PRICING

248
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,538
IN LESS THAN A 10% CHANCE OF A

249
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,540
HIKE IN SEPTEMBER.

250
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,909
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE RISKIER

251
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,146
ASSETS DOING WELL.

252
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:14,880
PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE

253
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,584
CONFIDENT ABOUT GROWTH OUTLOOK.

254
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,220
THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS,

255
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,291
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST AS FAR AS

256
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,926
THE MARKET IS CONCERNED, IS THE

257
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,694
ELECTION.

258
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,831
I THINK THE ONLY WAY THE MARKET

259
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,932
CAN BE RIGHT IS IF WE END UP

260
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,734
WITH GRIDLOCK.

261
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:44,610
ANY OTHER OUTCOME, MEANING, IF

262
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,512
THERE IS A CLEAN SWEEP, WE WILL

263
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,950
PROBABLY SEE A BIG CHANGE IN

264
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,650
FISCAL POLICY NEXT YEAR.

265
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,589
SCARLET: WE LOVE IT WHEN GUESTS

266
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,192
MENTION PROPRIETARY INDEXES.

267
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,161
YOU TALKED ABOUT VOLATILITY IN

268
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,995
THE DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES AND

269
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,530
HOW IT HAS COME DOWN QUITE A

270
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,264
BIT.

271
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,066
WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT

272
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:07,566
POSITIONING.

273
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,101
POSITIONING RIGHT NOW SEEMS TO

274
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,904
BE TRUMPING FUNDAMENTALS.

275
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,173
WHY IS IT MORE PRONOUNCED THIS

276
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,575
YEAR THAN IN PAST YEARS?

277
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,409
>> I THINK THE MAIN REASON IS

278
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:21,413
INVESTORS ARE STRUGGLING.

279
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,816
ARE YOU GOING TO DO THE SAME

280
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,084
TRADE AS EVERYBODY ELSE?

281
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:30,556
IF THE TRADE GOES DOWN, YOU KEEP

282
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,857
YOUR JOB.

283
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,692
IF YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON AND

284
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,262
THE TRADE GOES WRONG, YOU WILL

285
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,298
PROBABLY LOSE YOUR JOB.

286
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:44,036
INVESTORS HAVE TO REDEEM AND

287
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,772
SELL WHATEVER IS OVERWEIGHT.

288
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,506
WHATEVER IS OVERWEIGHT IS

289
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,308
UNDERPERFORMING.

290
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,379
THERE IS NO QUESTION.

291
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,281
IT IS ALMOST AT THE POINT WHERE

292
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,315
INVESTORS ARE RECONCILED TO THE

293
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,483
IDEA THAT FUNDAMENTALS DON'T

294
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,351
MATTER ANYMORE.

295
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:05,257
OLIVER: SO, WHAT SPECIFICALLY DO

296
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,091
YOU RECOMMEND THEY DO AS OPPOSED

297
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,559
TO JUST CHASING WHAT IS GOING

298
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,628
UP?

299
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:13,966
>> BETWEEN YOU AND I, SINCE 1980

300

FIVE, GOING INTO ELECTIONS,

301
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,536
PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT UNCERTAINTY.

302
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,606
RIGHT NOW, THE WAY THE MARKET IS

303
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,373
POSITIONED, VERY LONG RISK

304
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:25,344

THE MARKET IS LOOKING TO PLAY

308

FORWARD WITH THAT TRANSITION,

BE.

311
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,627
THE MARKET IS FACTORING IN A

00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,597
CLEAN SWEEP.

313
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,267

378
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,496
I AM MARK CRUMPTON.

379
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,163
BACK TO YOU, SCARLET.

380
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:50,302
SCARLET: THANK YOU, MARK.

381
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,204
DAVID, YOU HAVE NOTED THAT

382
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,005
INVESTORS SEEM TO BE INDIFFERENT

383
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,508
TO CHINA'S GRADUAL YOUNG -- YOU

384
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:03,782
ON -- YUAN DEVALUATION.

385
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,316
WHY IS THAT?

386
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,584
>> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

387
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,454
REASON IS THAT CHINA HAS BEEN

388
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,957
VERY SUCCESSFUL IN CRACKING DOWN

389
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,393
ON CAPITAL OUTFLOWS.

390
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,094
CAPITAL OUTFLOWS ARE SLOW AND

391
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,630
THEY ARE NOT INTERVENING MUCH.

392
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,232
I WILL TELL YOU WHY THAT IS

393
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:20,666
IMPORTANT.

394
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,533
I HAD LUNCH WITH MY REAL ESTATE

395
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,403
AGENT THE OTHER DAY, AND HE WAS

396
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,773
TELLING ME THAT LAST YEAR, 21

397
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,573
PERCENT OF APARTMENTS SOLD IN

398
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:32,711
NEW YORK CITY WERE SOLD TO

399
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,345
CHINESE INVESTORS.

400
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,582
THIS YEAR, IT IS 0%.

401
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,116
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CHINESE

402
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,385
TO GET AUTHORIZATION TO MAKE

403
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,220
FOREIGN INVESTMENTS.

404
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,987
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS

405
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:42,721
CRACKED DOWN AND CLOSED THE

406
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,691
BORDERS.

407
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,661
THIS IS WHY CHINA HAS NOT HAD TO

408
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:54,666
SELL COMMODITIES OR STOCKS.

409
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,400
DEPRECIATION HAS BEEN FAIRLY

410
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,568
LIMITED.

411
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:02,207
OLIVER: RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD

412
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,842
FAVOR A LONG U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS

413
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,079
THE CHINESE CURRENCY.

414
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,913
DEPRECIATION IS HAPPENING AT A

415
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:16,221
SLOWER RATE.

416
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,055
>> FOR ONE THING, THE LESS THE

417
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,557
MARKET CARES ABOUT THE MARKET

418
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:24,863
GOING DOWN, THE LESS IT GOING TO

419
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,798
GO.

420
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,234
THAT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT

421
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:34,072
CHINA'S STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN

422
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,674
 STRUGGLING, THEY HAVE NOT

423
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,274
CUT INTEREST RATES.

424
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:37,876
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS CUT INTEREST

425
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,146
RATES EXCEPT FOR CHINA.

426
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,615
THEY DON'T WANT MORE LEVERAGE.

427
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,150
THEY DON'T WANT TO CUT INTEREST

428
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,017
RATES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

429
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,986
MORE DEBT.

430
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,554
THE ONLY THING LEFT ON THE TABLE

431
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,989
IS WEAKER R&B.

432
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,692
SO YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE R&B HAS

433
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,226
ROOM TO FALL.

434
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:59,998
OLIVER: LET'S TALK ABOUT JAPAN.

435
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,800
AFTER RECENT ELECTIONS, THERE

436
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,068
WAS A HOPE THERE WOULD BE MORE

437
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,002
VIGOROUS STIMULUS.

438
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,973
THE BOJ SAID THEY WOULD VISIT TO

439
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,243
THEIR MONETARY FRAMEWORK.

440
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,978
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR

441
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,047
JAPAN AND AROUND THE WORLD?

442
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,615
>> THERE IS NOTHING MORE

443
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,417
IMPORTANT TO ME THAN JAPAN RIGHT

444
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,217
NOW, AND IT SHOULD BE FOR

445
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,986
EVERYBODY.

446
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:25,090
THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL BEEN

447
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,324
GOING THROUGH A JAPANESE

448
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:27,092
VACATION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

449
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,026
YEARS.

450
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,028

451
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,863

453
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,032
ELSE.

454
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,167
AT THIS POINT, THE ONLY THING

455
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:40,038
LEFT ON THE TABLE AS FAR AS

456
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,475
JAPAN IS CONCERNED IS HELL A

457
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:46,545
 HELICOPTER MONEY.

458
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,312
WE ARE TALKING MAJOR FISCAL

459
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:51,482
STIMULUS.

460
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:56,355
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GET THEM

461
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,626
GOING.

462
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,160
EVERYBODY WANTS TO WATCH HOW BAD

463
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,495
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET FOR

464
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,998
JAPAN.

465
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:09,201
I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET.

466
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,404
IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT WAS THE

467
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,738
SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN

00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,640

469
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,079

470
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,514
JOBLESS RATE WAS NEGATIVE IN THE

NIKKEI SOLD OFF.

472
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,853
AFTER THAT, NOBODY WAS TALKING

473
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,822
ABOUT BREXIT ANYMORE.

474
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,590

707
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,060

709
00:34:58,195 --> 00:34:59,263
PROCESS.

710
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:05,536
WE THINK THE SEC DID NOT CARRY

711
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,270
OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.

712
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,038
THE RULE OF THE LAND SAYS YOUR

713
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:07,738

IF THE SEC WANTS TO CHANGE THAT,

717
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:17,281
IT SHOULD HAVE GONE TO COMMENT

718
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,649
AND REVIEW AND LET THE MARKET

719
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:19,183
ADJUST TO THAT.

720
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:19,684

721
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,619

727
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,028
COMMENT AND REVIEW.

728
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,431
IN THE PAST, WE HAVE TRIED TO

729
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,068
PRESENT TO THE COMMISSION

730
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:37,902
SOMETHING LIKE A SPEED BUMP AND

731
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,104
IT DID NOT GET APPROVAL.

732
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:40,871
THEY DID NOT WANT US TO GO

733
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,107
THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

734
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:43,908
WE USE THAT AS A WAY TO START

735
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,912
THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE

736
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,746
IMPROVE THE INVESTOR EXPERIENCE

737
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:53,618
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES IN

738
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,452
RESPECT TO THE ARTIFICIAL DELAY

739
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:54,985
BEING PUT IN.

740
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:55,486
WHAT CAN WE DO?

741
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,056
OUR CUSTOMERS SAID WE WANT TO

742
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,659
HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE REWARDED

743
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,393
BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE

744
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,162
LONG-TERM INVESTORS THAT DON'T

745
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:05,863
CARE ABOUT THE MICROSECOND

746
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:06,330
DIFFERENTIAL.

747
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,202
THIS REWARD AS THE GREAT

748
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:11,902
ADVANTAGE OF BEING SIMPLE.

749
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:12,636
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A SPEED

750
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:13,637
BUMP, AS YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT

751
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,940
TO PEOPLE, IT IS VERY

752
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,407
COMPLICATED.

753
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:21,979
YOU TALK ABOUT A LIMITED ORDER

754
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:22,747
THAT HAS A SECOND DURATION TO

755
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:23,514
GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE.

756
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,148
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.

757
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,517
BETTY: WHO WAS ASKING FOR THAT?

758
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,421
BOB: WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANYBODY

759
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,255
WHO DOES NOT WANT THIS TYPE OF

760
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,825
CAPABILITY IN THE MARKING -- IN

761
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:35,359
THE MARKETPLACE.

762
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,193
THE SIMPLICITY OF IT IS WHAT IS

763
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,095
APPEALING TO A LARGE NUMBER OF

764
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:38,496
PEOPLE.

765
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:43,134
WE THINK THE INITIAL ADOPTIVE

766
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,935
WILL BE THE BUY SIDE, WHO DOES

767
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:48,038
NOT CARE ABOUT THE DIFFERENTIAL.

768
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:49,940
I WILL GIVE YOU TWO SECONDS TO

769
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,175
GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE.

770
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:56,180
WE ALSO THINK THAT THE FIRM'S

771
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,750
HAVE ENGAGED IN HIGH DEGREES OF

772
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,954
TRADING TODAY AND WILL FIND

773
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:04,722
POSITIVE WAYS OF USING THIS.

774
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,492
BETTY: SOME OF THE REACTION TO

775
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,394
HEARING ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN,

776
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,631
LOOK, NASDAQ, INCREASING IT HAS

777
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,365
BEEN FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY.

778
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,200
BOB: WE HAVE TO BE.

779
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,603
BETTY: SPEED IS EVERYTHING IN

780
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:22,006
THIS MARKET.

781
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:22,807
AT LEAST, THAT IS WHAT IT HAS

782
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,843
BEEN UP TO NOW.

783
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,845
AS TECHNOLOGY IS DELIVERING MORE

784
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,614
SPEED ON THAT SIDE OF YOUR

785
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,050
BUSINESS, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO

786
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,818
INTRODUCE A PRODUCT THAT COULD

787
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,485
SLOW THAT PROCESS DOWN?

788
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,853
BOB: I WILL DISAGREE WITH THE

789
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,555
COMMENT THAT SPEED HAS BEEN

790
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,224
EVERYTHING IN THE MARKET.

791
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,058
CAPITAL IS A DOMINANT FACTOR IN

792
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:41,826
THE MARKET.

793
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,495
IF SOMEONE WANTS TO COMMIT TO A

794
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:49,467
BUYING OR SELLING COMMITMENT,

795
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,234
THAT IS A DIFFERENCE THERE.

796
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,068
WE CANNOT BE ANY POSITION WHERE

797
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,004
WE WANT TO STOP TECHNOLOGY.

798
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,072
TECHNOLOGY WILL ADVANCE.

799
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,874
THE GREAT PART OF THIS

800
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,010
ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT IN A SIMPLE

801
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,778
WAY, WE ALLOW TECHNOLOGY TO

802
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,178
CONTINUE.

803
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:01,946
THERE IS NO ARTIFICIAL DELAY.

804
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:07,151
YOU KNOW HAVE A CHOICE -- YOU

805
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:07,718
NOW HAVE A CHOICE.

806
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,487
IT CHANGES MARKET STRUCTURE

807
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,121
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

808
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:12,556
BY GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE

809
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,390
LINE BY MAKING A COMMITMENT TO

810
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:13,924
THE MARKETPLACE.

811
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,294
BETTY: HAVEN'T YOU SAID BEFORE

812
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,062
THAT INTRODUCING AN ORDER WILL

813
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,563
COMPLICATE THE MARKETS EVEN

814
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,631
MORE?

815
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,167
BOB: IF YOU HAVE A SPEEDBUMP

816
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:29,006
THAT HAS 350 SECONDS MICRO

817
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,241

818
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,511
WITH 344 330.

819
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:37,481
IT SIMPLIFIES THE MARKETS.

820
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,851
AS IT WAS PRESENTED TO ME, I

821
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,586
SAID THE GENIUS OF THIS IS THE

822
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,053
SIMPLICITY.

823
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:43,821
YOU MAKE THE COMMITMENT, YOU GO

824
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,489
TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE.

825
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:50,727
HARD STOP.

826
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:52,830
THE FIRST THING WE HAD WAS THE

827
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,364
MARKET ORDER.

828
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,632
AFTER THAT, PEOPLE CAME UP WITH

829
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,199
A LIMIT ORDER.

830
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,469
I SUBMIT THAT THIS ADVANCE WHERE

831
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,770
WE HAVE A LIMIT ORDER THAT HAS

832
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,471
ADVANTAGE BASED UPON A

833
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,475
COMMITMENT TO IT WILL REPRESENT

834
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,175
A FUNDAMENTAL EVOLUTION OF

835
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:05,976
MARKET STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO WHAT

836
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,578

840
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:14,752
WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS

841
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,923
BEEN IN THE U.S. 

842
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,691
SOME COMPANIES ON THE PIPELINE

843
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:25,196

847
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,768
TO BREAK OUT INTO THE PUBLIC.

848
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,070
WE HAVE SEEN ASIAN COMPANIES

849
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,904
WANT TO STAY THERE BECAUSE THEY

850
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,106
ARE GETTING HIGHER VALUATION.

851
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:35,839
HOW DO YOU GET THEM HERE?

852
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,009
BOB: I THINK THE IPO MARKET IS

853
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,778
DISAPPOINTING BUT NOT DISMAL.

854
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,680

855
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,118
BOB: COMPANIES ARE GOING PUBLIC.

856
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:49,019
THE WINDOW IS NOT SHUT.

857
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,020
WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF

858
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,123

00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,898
WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT TRUMP?

942
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:01,698
THEY HAVE A PRETTY CONSISTENT

943
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,466
TONE WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD

944
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,434
TRUMP.

945
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,167
WHAT CONSISTENTLY -- WHAT

946
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:04,868
SPECIFICALLY DID THEY SAY?

947
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,105
ALEX: JOE BIDEN WAS THE MORE

948
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,107
INTERESTING OF THE TWO.

949
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,142
HE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP'S

950
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,045
RECENT CLAIM THAT PRESIDENT

951
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,881
OBAMA FOUND IN ISIS, THE

952
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,083
TERRORIST GROUP, PRESENTS A

953
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:26,123
THREAT TO  IN THE MIRROR -- A

954
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,325
THREAT TO TROOPS IN THE MIDDLE

955
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,494
EAST. IT RAISED A COUPLE OF

956
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:30,894
CLICKS.

957
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:37,200
JOE: LET'S LOOK AT THE

958
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,001
CHALLENGES FACING THE JAPANESE

959
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,436
EMPEROR AS HE FACES APPLICATION.

960
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:44,474
IT WOULD REQUIRE A -- ABDICATION

961
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:44,775
.

962
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,343
IT WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE

963
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:50,714
LAW.

964
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:51,615
SHINZO ABE'S GOVERNMENT WOULD

965
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,450
HAVE TO REVISE THE PEACEFUL

966
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:53,984
CONSTITUTION.

967
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:57,421
WHAT IS GOING ON?

968
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,723
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO PLAY OUT

969
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:00,524
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AS

970
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,392
WE FIND OUT ABOUT THE INTENT TO

971
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:06,463
STEP DOWN?

972
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,800
SHEILA: TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING

973
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,868
HERE.

974
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:11,702
IN A VIDEO, THE EMPEROR SAYS HE

975
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,637
WOULD RATHER STEP DOWN BEFORE

976
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:18,008
HIS DEATH, ALLOWING

977
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:18,876
SUCCESSION THAT IS SMOOTH AND

978
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,479
STEADY AND WOULD NOT AFFECT THE

979
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,549
DAILY LIVES OF THE JAPANESE.

980
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:30,687
AS HE POINTED OUT, THIS COMES ON

981
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,055
THE BACKDROP OF A FAIRLY HEALTHY

982
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:32,856
JAPANESE DEBATE OVER WHETHER OR

983
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,559
NOT TO BEGIN TALKS ABOUT WHETHER

984
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:38,162
TO REVISE THE CONSTITUTION.

985
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,864
NO ONE AT THE MOMENT THINKS THAT

986
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,668
THE REQUEST WILL REQUIRE

987
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,970
TOUCHING ARTICLE TWO OF THE

988
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,274
CONSTITUTION, WHICH REFERS TO

989
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:50,907
THE ROLE OF EMPEROR.

990
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:55,779
SCARLET: SHINZO ABE DID WELL IN

991
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,048
RECENT ELECTIONS AND HE HAS BEEN

992
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:04,087
VOCAL IN HIS OPPOSITION.

993
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:08,325
SHEILA: THERE'S AN ELECTION IN

994
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,126
JULY IN THE UPPER HOUSE.

995
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,827
HER THE FIRST TIME IN THE

996
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,997
PRO-WAR PERIOD, PEOPLE WHO WERE

997
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,167
OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT

998
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,001
CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION MANAGED

999
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:18,402
TO WIN.

1000
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:23,306
ABE'S RULING COALITION, HIS OWN

1001
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:28,412
PARTY AND SMALLER PART, WILL BEK

1002
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,413
GUIDING THE CONVERSATION.

1003
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:33,216
OME -- BE GUIDING THE

1004
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,284
CONVERSATION.

1005
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:41,425
KOME IS NOT EXCITED ABOUT IT.

1006
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:46,697
THE LARGER QUESTION IS ABE'S

1007
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,066
JUDGED ON WHETHER HE MANAGES TO

1008
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:53,603
STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE JAPANESE

1009
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:53,970
ECONOMY.

1010
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:54,504
WAGES REMAIN LOW.

1011
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:58,708
THERE HAS NOT BEEN CHANGE IN

1012
00:47:58,708 --> 00:47:59,610
ORDINARY JAPANESE FAMILIES.

1013
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,446
HE IS TRYING TO MANAGE HIS

1014
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:03,146
CONVERSATION WITH JAPANESE

1015
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,182
COMPANIES TO SEE IF THEY WILL

1016
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,453
LET GO OF SOME OF THE PROFITS

1017
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:10,687
AND INVEST IN THE JAPANESE LABOR

1018
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:11,088
FORCE.

1019
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:16,026
>> WHAT ARE THE CHANCES ON THAT?

1020
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,395
HE HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR YEARS.

1021
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,196
THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS AT

1022
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,097
FISCAL STIMULUS.

1023
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,832
THE ATTEMPTS OF THE BOJ HAVE

1024
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:26,904
BEEN MIXED AT BEST.

1025
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:31,708
DO YOU SEE ANY REAL PROSPECT FOR

1026
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,210
TURNING A CORNER IN A POSITIVE

1027
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,111
WAY AND IS THERE ANYTHING HE CAN

1028
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,879
DO SPECIFICALLY?

1029
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,648
SHEILA: WE WERE WATCHING

1030
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:41,551
JAPANESE POLICYMAKERS MOVED BACK

1031
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,220
TO A MORE TRADITIONAL APPROACH

1032
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,289
TO STIMULATE GROWTH.

1033
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,089
HE HAS A HUGE STIMULUS IN THE

1034
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,624
WORKS WHICH INCLUDES

1035
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:53,096
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING TO R

1036
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,333
URAL LOCALES.

1037
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,167
HE HAS TAPPED A COUPLE OF SENIOR

1038
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:02,973
LDP PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WAYS

1039
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:03,807
TO BRING MORE OF THE POPULATION

1040
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:04,541
CONCENTRATED IN TOKYO OUT TO

1041
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,009
RURAL AREAS.

1042
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:10,180
HE IS USING THIS VISION OF A

1043
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,484
REVITALIZED JAPAN TO SPEAK TO

1044
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,218
PROBLEMS AND NEEDS RURAL.

1045
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:18,188
THE BOJ IS LIMITED.

1046
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,158
HE CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE THAT HE

1047
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:25,228
HAS INFLUENCE AT HIS DISPOSAL.

1048
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,130
ABLE BE PART OF THE MIX,

1049
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:27,564
OBVIOUSLY.

1050
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:32,369
I THINK THE ABE CAP THAT IS

1051
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,170
FALLING BACK ON OLDER PATTERNS

1052
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:42,045
AND THEY HAVE WALKED0 BACK FROM

1053
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,480
THE CONSUMPTION TAX THAT WAS

1054
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,181
ABOUT TO BE IMPOSED ON THE

1055
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,083
JAPANESE CONSUMER.

1056
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:46,917
THEY HAVE PUSHED THAT OFF FOR A

1057
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:47,450
COUPLE OF YEARS.

1058
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,253
SCARLET: SHINZO ABE HAS FAMOUSLY

1059
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:55,792
PUSH FOR WOMENOMICS.

1060
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,527
WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT IN THE

1061
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:02,065
NEXT CENTURY JAPAN WILL HAVE AN

1062
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:02,866
EMPRESS INSTEAD OF AN EMPEROR AS

1063
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:03,567
THE SYMBOLIC HEAD OF STATE?

1064
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,402
SHEILA: THAT IS BEHIND THE

1065
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:10,607
QUESTION OF HOW THE LAW OF THE

1066
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,411
SECESSION PRONK -- SUCCESSION

1067
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,612
PROCESS IS DEBATED ON THE FLOOR.

1068
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,847
IN 2005 WE HAD A SIMILAR

1069
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:18,648
SITUATION.

1070
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:24,955
THE CROWN PRINCE AND PRINCESS

1071
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,890
HAVE A DAUGHTER.

1072
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,960
THEY WERE ADVISED ON A

1073
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:36,633
SUCCESSION PROCESS, HOW TO

1074
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:37,334
ADVANCE A STEADY POWER.

1075
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,002
THEY RECOMMENDED FEMALE

1076
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:39,502
SUCCESSION.

1077
00:50:39,502 --> 00:50:41,605
A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE CROWN

1078
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:45,842
PRINCE AND HIS WIFE GAVE BIRTH

1079
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,177
TO A SON.

1080
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:47,978
IT WAS TABLED AND PUT OFF FOR

1081
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:48,411
ANOTHER DAY.

1082
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:50,880
THERE IS A LOT OF SPECULATION

1083
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,882
THAT THERE WILL BE NOT JUST A

1084
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:57,153
RESPONSE TO EMPEROR AKIHITO'S

1085
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:57,887

SCARLET:-- QUESTION WILL COME

1091
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:10,600

SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER TOM

00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:46,289
BARRICK SAYS THERE IS A REASON

1100
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:46,689
FOR IT.

1101
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,725
HE EXPLAINED TO ERIC SHATZER IN

1102
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,061
AN EXCLUSIVE VIDEO.

1103
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,564
TOM: ENTITLEMENTS ARE 67% OF THE

ANOTHER 7%.

1107
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,709
DEFENSE IS 30% OR 14%.

1108
00:54:06,709 --> 00:54:07,444
THERE IS VERY LITTLE LEFT.

1109
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:10,346
YOU LOOK AT ENTITLEMENTS, THAT

1110
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:10,747
IS 67%.

1111
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,549
YOU HAVE GOT TO MOVE IT.

1112
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,919
WHY DOES NOBODY TALK ABOUT IT?

1113
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,719
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOES NOT

1114
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:17,654
WANT TO REDUCE ENTITLEMENTS.

1115
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:18,521
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC STILL WANTS

1117
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:22,926
IT IS NOT THE AMERICAN WAY.

1118
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,828
IT IS NOT THE SYSTEM THAT IS

00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:25,595
FAILING, IT IS US THAT IS

1120
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,029
FAILING.

1121
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,597
WHY?

1122
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,366
WE HAVE BUILT A PRISON IN WHICH

1123
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:31,801
WE ARE THE PRISONERS.

1124
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,604
