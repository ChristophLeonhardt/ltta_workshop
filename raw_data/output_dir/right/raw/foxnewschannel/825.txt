1
00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:00,888
MONTH.

2
00:00:00,888 --> 00:00:03,691
THERE'S BEEN A 400% INCREASE IN

3
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:04,792
THE NUMBER OF SO-CALLED FAMILY

4
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:14,402
UNITS CROSSING THE BORDER.

5
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:17,071
>> Sandra: TOM ROBERTS,

6
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:19,140
THANK YOU.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,042
UP NEXT WE HAVE A HENRY CUELLAR.

8
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:23,044
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

9
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,345
TONIGHT, IF YOU COULD, RESPOND

10
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,247
TO WHAT YOU HEARD OF THERE FROM

11
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:26,981
THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY

12
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:29,050
AS SHE TOOK THE MICROPHONE OF

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,184
THE WHITE HOUSE TO TRY TO

14
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:33,221
CLARIFY WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LOT

15
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,690
OF CONFUSION AS TO WHAT IS

16
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,594
HAPPENING DOWN AT OUR BORDER.

17
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:41,963
>> Henry: I'M HERE AT THE

18
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:43,664
BORDER AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME

19
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:44,966
WITH A WATER PATROL FOLKS TODAY.

20
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:51,539
KEEP IN MIND THAT, FROM THE

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,910
PUBLIC PART OF 2017 UNTIL NOW,

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,445
THESE KIDS UNACCOMPANIED WITH NO

23
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:59,847
PARENTS HAVE COME INTO THE LOWER

24
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:01,882
RIO GRANDE.

25
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:02,216
14,500.

26
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:02,850
SO THERE'S NO SEPARATION

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,120
INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY CAME IN BY

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,255
THEMSELVES.

29
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:08,356
THE FAMILY UNITS THAT CAME IN ON

30
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:11,959
THE LAST FIVE WEEKS FOR EXAMPLE,

31
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,429
ABOUT 1100 OF THEM HAVE BEEN

32
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:18,032
SEPARATED.

33
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:22,903
700 THEM ARE NOW WITH HHS AND

34
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:23,638
ANOTHER 436 OF THEM WERE

35
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:24,372
TEMPORARILY SEPARATED, BUT THEY

36
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:25,539
ARE BACK WITH THE FAMILIES

37
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:28,643
BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKEN OVER TO

38
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:33,648
BE CHARGED IN SECTION 2325 WHICH

39
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:34,849
IS COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES

40
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:35,850
WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION.

41
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,452
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SMALL

42
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:38,786
AMOUNT.

43
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:40,221
>> Sandra: SO YOU ARE DOWN

44
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,155
THERE AND WITNESSING WHAT'S

45
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:43,057
HAPPENING, AND TRYING TO TELL US

46
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:43,457
ABOUT THAT.

47
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:44,925
SO WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR?

48
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:48,062
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE DONE?

49
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:49,463
DEMOCRATS ARE POINTING THE

50
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:50,164
FINGER AT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

51
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:52,466
HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR WHAT IS

52
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:52,833
HAPPENING.

53
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:58,639
>> KEEP IN MIND, THEY CAME IN

54
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,241
THE FIRST TIME WITHOUT

55
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:00,841
DOCUMENTATION.

56
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,677
THAT MEANS IT IS A MISDEMEANOR

57
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:05,713
THE SECOND TIME, THE FIRST TIME

58
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:07,048
IT BECOMES A FELONY.

59
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:10,751
THIS IS A 1950 LAW THAT

60
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:14,855
RONALD REAGAN, NIXON, BUSH,

61
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:15,856
OBAMA, THEY NEVER CARRIED THIS

62
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:16,657
OUT.

63
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:19,493
THEY CARRIED IT ONTO A CIVIL

64
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:20,061
PROCESS.

65
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:20,728
SO THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE

66
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:24,432
MAKING IT A CRIMINAL ASPECT.

67
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:27,435
>> Sandra: WHAT THAT WOULD BE

68
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,170
ABOUT WHAT THE HOMELAND SECURITY

69
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,237
SECRETARY SAID TODAY, SHE'S

70
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:33,307
FAITHFULLY ENFORCING THE LAWS

71
00:02:33,307 --> 00:00:00,000
ENACTED BY CONGRESS.
