1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,204
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FAIR

2
00:00:02,204 --> 00:00:04,139
PROCESS, YOU CAME TO THE WRONG

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,540
TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, MY

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,612
FRIEND.

5
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:11,313
PETE: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM

6
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:13,015
DECIDED TO TAKE HIS TIME FROM

7
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:13,682
MISS MITCHELL, THE ARIZONA

8
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:14,416
PROSECUTOR, AND GO AHEAD AND LET

9
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,219
EVERYONE KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT OF

10
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:17,653
THIS PROCESS.

11
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:18,387
SENATOR, DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE

12
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:18,887
GOING TO SAY THAT?

13
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:23,759
>> KNOW.

14
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:24,293
I KNEW I FELT THAT.

15
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:25,527
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING

16
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:25,828
TO DO.

17
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:26,528
I THOUGHT MISS MITCHELL DID A

18
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:28,497
GOOD JOB.

19
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:29,231
THE WHOLE GOAL FOR ME IS TO GET

20
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:36,538
DOCTOR FORD, WALK HER THROUGH

21
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:37,239
HER TESTIMONY, WHAT YOU CAN'T

22
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:37,973
SAY, SHE IS 100% CONFIDENT BUT

23
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:40,342
LET ME TELL YOU I'M 100%

24
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:41,543
CONFIDENT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH,

25
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:47,616
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO MISS

26
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,350
FORD BUT AFTER HER TESTIMONY, I

27
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,518
DON'T KNOW WHO TOOK HER TO THE

28
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:54,022
PARTY, I DON'T KNOW WHO DROVE

29
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:54,656
HER BACK BUT SOMEBODY DID.

30
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,526
I DO KNOW THIS.

31
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:58,260
WE OFFERED TO TAKE HER TESTIMONY

32
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,963
IN PRIVATE IN CALIFORNIA AND IF

33
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:01,630
HER LAWYERS DIDN'T TELL HER

34
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,264
THAT, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.

35
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:05,033
I KNOW HER LETTER WAS GIVEN TO 3

36
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:05,768
GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND THE PERSON

37
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,870
WHO LEAKED IT TO THE PRESS

38
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,905
INTENDED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

39
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:12,174
IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION BY

40
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:17,213
SOMEBODY TO BETRAY HER TRUST, TO

41
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:17,880
SLOW DOWN THIS NOMINATION,

42
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,614
DESTROY BRETT KAVANAUGH AND TRY

43
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,517
TO HOLD HIS SEAT OPEN.

44
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:24,887
AINSLEY: WHY DID YOU DO IT?

45
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:25,588
YOU SAID WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

46
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:26,322
WANTED TO SAY BUT HAVEN'T BEEN

47
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:29,692
ABLE TO SAY.

48
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:30,292
>> THERE WAS A LINE OF

49
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:33,529
QUESTIONING, WHY DON'T YOU TURN

50
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:39,435
TO DON THE GONE -- MCGAHN SO THE

51
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,604
FBI CAN DO A THOROUGH JOB AND

52
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:42,137
HERE'S WHAT GOT ME.

53
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:47,042
HOW DARE YOU ASK THIS MAN IF HE

54
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:53,516
IS INNOCENT, TO DO ANYTHING.

55
00:01:53,516 --> 00:02:01,524
HE IS BEFORE YOU, DENYING IT IN

56
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:02,224
EVERY DETAIL, WE STILL DON'T

57
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:02,892
KNOW THE DATE, THE LOCATION.

58
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:03,626
IT IS NOT HE SAID SHE SAID, SHE

59
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:10,566
SAID, THEY SAID.

60
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:11,300
IT WAS AN EFFORT POLITICALLY TO

61
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,536
DELAY THE HEARING, TO PUT THE

62
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,071
BURDEN ON HIM, TO MAKE IT LOOK

63
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:15,771
LIKE HE MUST BE GUILTY IF HE

64
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,439
DOESN'T WANT TO DELAY THIS

65
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,073
HEARING PAST THE MIDTERMS.

66
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:20,576
I HAD IT WITH THIS PROCESS.

67
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:21,244
THE PERSON WHO LEAKED THIS

68
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:26,115
LETTER DID IT ON PURPOSE TO

69
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:26,849
CREATE A POLITICAL PROBLEM, TO

70
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,518
SLOW DOWN THE HEARING, TO START

71
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:33,222
A NARRATIVE, TO DESTROY BRETT

72
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:33,956
CAVANAGH, THEY COULD GIVE A DAMN

73
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:34,457
ABOUT DOCTOR FORD.

74
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:35,157
IF SHE WAS NOT TOLD WE WERE

75
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:35,891
WILLING TO GO TO CALIFORNIA, I

76
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:40,630
FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.

77
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,531
PETE: YOUR COLLEAGUE DIANE

78
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:44,968
FEINSTEIN WAS QUERIED BY JOHN

79
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:49,539
CORNYN, DID YOU LEAK IT?

80
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:54,577
SHE SAID NO I DIDN'T.

81
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:55,311
BUT I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM, I TRUST

82
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:55,578
HIM.

83
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:56,312
THE PAST STAFF SAID WE DIDN'T DO

84
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:57,614
IT AND SHE SAID PROBABLY CAME

85
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:00,350
FROM ONE OF DOCTOR FORD'S

86
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,683
FRIENDS.

87
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:01,551
DO YOU BUY THAT?

88
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:04,988
>> KNOW.

89
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:05,722
I BY DIANE FEINSTEIN, I LIKE HER

90
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:09,525
AND TRUST HER.

91
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:10,259
SOMEBODY DID IT IN THE CIRCLE OF

92
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,529
THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSWOMAN IN

93
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:16,232

OFFICE, THE LAWYERS, THE LAWYERS

95
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:21,538
WERE RECOMMENDED BY FEINSTEIN.

96
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:26,175
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE SHE IS

97
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:29,546
COMING FROM, SHE IS NOT EXACTLY

98
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:31,514
APOLITICAL.

99
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:33,516
SOMEBODY LEAKED THIS ANONYMOUS

100
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:37,520
ALLEGATION FOR THE VERY PURPOSE

101
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,221

INTENDED TO PROTECT MISS FORD.

105
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:46,963
>> USED UP FOR YOURSELF, LOOKED

00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:47,664
AT THE DEMOCRATS AND SAID YOU

107
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:50,100

00:03:55,772 --> 00:04:01,778
YOUR MESSAGE FOR YOUR FRIENDS

THAT ARE REPUBLICANS?

VOTING KNOW YOU ARE SETTING UP

LEGITIMIZING THE POLITICS OF

00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,964
DESTRUCTION.

122
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:22,666
YOU ARE MISSING A LOT IF YOU

HIT JOB.

00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:29,439
THE ACCUSATIONS OF FALL APART.

126
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,106
IF HE HAS TO PROVE HIMSELF

127
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:33,543
INNOCENT, HE DID FOR ME, WHAT

DAUGHTERS YOU I CANNOT DO THAT.

WHITEHOUSE?

138
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,231
IF HE DOES GET CONFIRMED BY

139
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:54,831
TUESDAY THEY WILL START

140
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:57,534
IMPEACHING.

141
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:01,538
THEY WILL LOOK TO IMPEACH HIM.

142
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,473
>> HE BROUGHT TO ME THE

143
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:04,208
ALLEGATION ABOUT THE INCIDENT IN

144
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,542
RHODE ISLAND AND WE WENT

145
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,010
TOGETHER TO THE FBI AND THE GUY

146
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,513
WITHDREW THE ACCUSATION.

147
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:14,351
IT WAS FALSE.

148
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:14,952
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.

149
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:15,619
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT COULD

150
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,521
HAPPEN.

151
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,122
THERE IS NO STATUTE OF

152
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:19,957
LIMITATIONS AND MARYLAND FOR

153
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:20,424
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

154
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:21,158
I WOULD TELL SENATOR WHITEHOUSE

155
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:24,595
AND EVERYBODY ELSE IF THE POLICE

156
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,329
DEPARTMENT OR ANY OTHER AGENCY

157
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,264
OPENS THIS CASE AND THERE IS A

158
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:31,635
CONVICTION I WILL GLADLY REOPEN

159
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:32,369
THIS MATTER BUT I WILL BE IN THE

160
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:33,537
NBA BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

161
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:36,673
I DON'T LIKE MY CHANCES.

162
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:41,512
PETE: YESTERDAY YOU WERE SO

163
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:42,613
PASSIONATE.

164
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:49,520
>> I WAS PISSED.

165
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,254
BRIAN: IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE YOU

166
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:50,921
HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH HOW

167
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,456
THINGS ARE WORKING IN THAT ROOM.

168
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:57,528
>> I HAD IT UP TO HERE BECAUSE I

169
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:01,765
VOTED FOR SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN,

170
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:02,433
SOME ACCUSED HER OF BEING A

171
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,100
RACIST BECAUSE OF A SINGLE

172
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:09,073
SPEECH OR KAGAN BEING

173
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:09,673
UN-AMERICAN BECAUSE SHE

174
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:10,407
SUPPORTED KICKING THE ROTC UNIT

175
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:10,875
OUT OF HARVARD.

176
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,408
THAT IS AT HARVARD.

177
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:12,142
THEY ARE GOOD LIBERAL JUDGES,

178
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:19,950
GOOD WOMEN AND I CAN'T IMAGINE I

179
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,684
WOULD HAVE DONE THIS TO THEM AND

180
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:21,418
WHAT WAS DONE TO BRETT CAVANAGH

181
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:22,086
WAS PLANNED, ORCHESTRATED,

182
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:24,622
POLITICS AT ITS WORST, THE

183
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:25,222
ACCUSATIONS OFFENDS MY

184
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:25,623
SENSIBILITY.

185
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:27,958
I WANT WOMEN TO BE HEARD BUT I

186
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,659
WILL NOT BE PLAYED AND I WILL

187
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:29,293
NOT HAVE MY INTELLIGENCE

188

196
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:49,513
>> THEY ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE

197
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:49,847
FOR HIM.

198
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,982

00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:53,517

SCALIA.

205
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,628
TRYING TO BE THE WAY IT USED TO

206
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,362
BE, ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES,

207
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:07,264
HONOR THE RESULTS BUT WHEN IT

208
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:09,533
COMES TO TRUMP THE ELECTION

209
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:09,967
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

210
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:12,036
WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS UNDERMINING

211
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:12,737
THE ELECTION, NO HOLDS BARRED

212
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:16,307
POLITICS, THE POLITICS OF

213
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:16,974
DESTRUCTION AND DELAY, NOT

214
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:17,508
ADVISE AND CONSENT.

215
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:20,911
IF HE LOSES, IF BRETT KAVANAUGH

216
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:21,646

217
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:25,116
GROUP TO COME FORWARD.

I SAID I HAVE A NEW NUMBER.

223
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,028
YOU DIDN'T GIVE THIS NUMBER OUT.

224
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:37,762
I GOT A NEW NUMBER AND A BUNCH

225
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:42,934

226
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:43,334

NEW ONE.

232
00:07:56,714 --> 00:08:00,685
HE WAS VERY COMPLEMENTARY AND HE

233
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:01,419
SAID MILANIA SAID, PLEASE TELL

234
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,958

235
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,692
FACT THAT I PUSH BACK AND STAND

236
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:08,393

237
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:09,527
MEANT A LOT TO ME THAT THE FIRST

238
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:10,828
LADY FELT THAT WAY.

239
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:16,467
PETE: SOMEBODY USING A

240
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,202

00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:17,802
PERSONAL INFORMATION ON

242
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:18,670
WIKIPEDIA SO PEOPLE COULD CALL

243
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,772
YOU.

244
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:21,539
I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE AN

245
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,408
INQUIRY INTO WHERE THAT

246
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,510
PARTICULAR MACHINE IS.

247
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,515
>> I TELL YOU WHAT.

248
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:31,249
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTERS I'M

249
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:31,950
THE PERFECT GUY TO ASK ABOUT

250
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,683
THEM BECAUSE I DON'T USE THEM A

251
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:33,351
LOT.

252
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,018
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

253
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:37,389
IF PEOPLE THINK I HAVE BRETT

254
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,023
KAVANAUGH, I AM PROUD HE

255
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:38,590
DESERVED TO BE HELPED.

256
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:45,030
THIS IS ABOUT HIM.

257
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,730
HE HAS LED A LIFE I COULDN'T

258
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,464
BEGIN TO IMAGINE IN TERMS OF WHO

259
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:47,766
HE IS COMING IN TERMS OF

260
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:56,742
INTELLECT AND HIS GOODNESS.

YEARS AND I AM IN A BUSINESS

265
00:08:59,177 --> 00:08:59,911
WHERE YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT

266
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:02,581
TO SAY, I AM FAIR GAME BUT THIS

267
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,215
GUY DID NOT DESERVE THIS.

268
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:03,915
HIS TWO DAUGHTERS IF NOTHING

269
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:05,550
ELSE IT SHOULD BE THE PARENTS OF

270
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,586
THE YEAR, THAT 10-YEAR-OLD, SHE

271
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:13,525

00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:14,192
PRAY FOR THE LADY AND THEY

273
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,628
RAISED A FINE YOUNG LADY.

274
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:17,329
AINSLEY: HIS PARENTS SITTING

275
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:17,729
BEHIND HIM.

276
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:23,535
>> BROKE MY HEART BUT IT IS WHAT

277
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:23,835
IT IS.

278
00:09:23,835 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE GOING TO WIN.
