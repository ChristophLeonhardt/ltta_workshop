"I was brought when I was 11."
"I came when I was
7 from Brazil."
"I was about 10."
"I was 12 years old."
"I was 7 years old."
"About 8 years old when I
came to the United States
with my mother and my sister."
"We crossed the border,
but we were little."
"My father was the first one
to leave Mexico and come here
in 2000, and then in
2001 my older siblings."
"So I've been here 18 years."
"I'm 29 years old."
"I am 20."
"I am 19 years old."
"I've been here for 21 years."
"I am 27 years old now."
"I am 23 years old and I
am originally from Mexico."
"When DACA was announced,
I remember exactly where
I was in 2012.
I was at the Museum
of American History."
"Before DACA, I always felt like
I was in between two worlds.
I was born in Honduras, but if
I were to go back to Honduras,
it's like I'm foreign to them."
"It's a tug of war.
When you're undocumented,
you're always
just wary of the situations,
of the locations, who
you are talking to, how
you're interacting with folks,
ensuring that you
don't do anything that
will bring attention
to you, because you
live a life of shadows."
"You know, I have been able
to accomplish a lot more than
when I was undocumented.
To get a Social Security
number, loans from the bank,
buy the car, a better job."
"I would leave behind
a network of friends,
family that are here.
Because a lot of us actually are
part of mixed status families."
"It's scary for me, because
you know, that type of job
that I have, you know,
motivating others and trying
to tell them like it's
O.K when I don't even
know if it's going to be O.K."
"Every time my parents
call me after 11 p.m.,
it's like my heart is racing.
When you are an immigrant
in this country,
you wake up every
day with the fear
that you could be taken away,
right, that your family could
be broken up."
"Well, I have been preparing
my kids of, you know,
these are the risks.
This could happen to
your dad and to me."
"I just can't --
can't imagine, you know,
my nieces and nephews
being separated from their
parents or them going back
to a country that
they don't know,
because this is their home.
They shouldn't
live with that fear
that I had to grow up with.
That's not a normal life.
That's not normal.
And I know that my friends
that are U.S. citizens
don't go through that.
And nobody should
go through that."
"I'm not leaving my home.
And I think, you know, if Trump
ever wanted to talk to us,
if he wanted to talk
to these dreamers,
he would realize that
we love this country,
want to stay here.
And --"
"If it's taken away,
I'm losing my job.
I'm losing the opportunity
of work and school.
People don't understand,
but it's a big thing.
It's a huge thing.
It's privileges that some
people here take for granted."
"Taking DACA away is like taking
a family member away from me.
That wall that Donald
Trump wants to build
is putting a wall in
front of me where I
won't be able to move forward."
"There are politicians who
are using us like a sport.
You know, they're using
us like punching bags."
"You are not just taking
something away from us,
but you're taking something
away from this country."
"Democrats and Republicans
alike have to stand up for us,
because there are DACA
beneficiaries in every state.
It's not just blue states."
"This land is not
a white America.
It's not.
This is a land of immigrants."
"I mean, I was already
a person before DACA.
A lot of people
say well, you know,
what's going to
happen after DACA?
I'm not going down
without a fight."
"You know, whatever happens
next, I love this country,
and I belong here."
"I'm fighting for my family.
I'm fighting for the friends of
mine that can't even stand up
because they're scared."
"We just want to stay here and
contribute to this country,
to the economy.
We are good people.
We're not criminals."
