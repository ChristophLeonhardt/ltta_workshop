1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,687
- [Ben] I like the shirt.

2
00:00:01,687 --> 00:00:03,800
- Thank you, I thought you'd dig it.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,010
The first time I see a Sarah
Press is overrated shirt

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,376
will be a very great day indeed.

5
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,590
(laughing)

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,220
A lot of people, especially here,

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,650
feel like you're just a fantastic debater,

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,550
destroyer of liberals and their arguments,

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,940
and that's not something
I've actually seen

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,260
a lot in practice.

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,783
I've seen you out debate
college students, ooh,

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,130
so I've seen you out
debate college students,

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,970
but they're college students.

14
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,130
If you were debating 19-year-old you,

15
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,350
I have no question that 19-year-old you

16
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,730
would get absolutely destroyed.

17
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,750
And I see you have a kind
of fireside chitchats

18
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,374
with Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson.

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,432
- [Audience] Post the question, question.

20
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:44,780
- [Ben] That's fine, I
understand, go ahead.

21
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,080
- You're not really debating them

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,913
in a substantial way either.

23
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,220
They have differences of opinions,

24
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,770
but I think you more
focus on why you agree

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,840
than why you disagree.

26
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,980
So my question is, A, if this is correct

27
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,900
and there are some exemptions,

28
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,250
like the Politicon debate last year,

29
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,170
why do you think this is?

30
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,650
Are liberals afraid to debate you?

31
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,850
Are you afraid to debate them?

32
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,850
Are there a lot of
examples of really great

33
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,379
head-to-head debates
that I'm just missing?

34
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,100
- Sure, I mean if you go back there,

35
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,830
I did a series of debates in Seattle

36
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,060
with a group of folks from
the local head of the NAACP,

37
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,720
a writer for The Seattle Stranger on race,

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,393
we did a debate with some
gun experts on gun rights.

39
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,960
I've literally spent my entire
life, my political life,

40
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,600
having conversations
with folks on the left.

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,831
In fact, those are the
conversations that I enjoy the most.

42
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:28,580
As far as why there are
all these tapes of me

43
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,540
destroying liberals at college campuses,

44
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,190
it's because college students
apparently have more courage

45
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,620
that a lot of professional
political pundits

46
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,862
who don't actually wanna get on a stage.

47
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:42,050
(audience clapping and cheering)

48
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,270
I've invited an inordinate number of folks

49
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,870
on the left onto the Sunday Special,

50
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,800
specifically because I actually prefer,

51
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,640
as opposed to the debate
format, the discussion format

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,720
because it allows you to
get a little bit deeper.

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,580
Debate formats themselves are
built for how do you destroy

54
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,090
the other side, how do
you undermine a point,

55
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,470
and that's fun, I don't
think it's necessarily

56
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,310
the most productive conversation.

57
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,640
And as you see, like when somebody gets up

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,810
and they ask about
nationalized healthcare,

59
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,790
I'm happy to have a
conversation back and forth

60
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,700
in a substantive way about healthcare

61
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,463
looking at the different
priorities and how they reflect.

62
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:12,310
In fact, if you actually go back

63
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,143
and you watch all the speeches

64
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,260
that I've made on college campuses,

65
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,350
I would say that there are
many more exchanges of me

66
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,760
talking with somebody on the
left in respectful manner

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,190
than there are tapes of me,

68
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,500
quote, unquote, destroying anybody.

69
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,710
Those are the ones that
people like to watch

70
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,020
because they're more fun,
but that doesn't mean

71
00:02:26,020 --> 00:00:00,000
that's what's actually
happening on a daily basis.
