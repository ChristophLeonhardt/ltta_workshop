Tucker: HARVARD PROFESSOR OF LAW ALAN DERSHOWITZ IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS LIBERALS IN THIS COUNTRY. INCREASINGLY HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH HOME LEFT ON THE LEFT BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO PARTICIPATE IN DOG THAT THE PARTICULAR ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT. DERSHOWITZ HAS SHARP SOLID CRITICIZED THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. HE SAYS JUSTIFYING ATTACKS ON CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT ALL OF US. FOR SAYING THAT HE SAYS HIS LIBERAL FRIENDS DON'T INVITE HIM TO DINNER PARTIES ANYMORE AND SOME BARK AT HIM. PROFESSOR DERSHOWITZ JOINS US TONIGHT. PROFESSOR, THANKS FOR COMING ON. THANK YOU. Tucker: YOU HAVE TAKEN UNPOPULAR, REALLY UNPOPULAR POSITIONS, SOME THAT I DISAGREE WITH OVER THE YEARS. AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD THIS PROBLEM. NO. Tucker: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? WELL, IT'S TRUMP. TRUMP CHANGES EVERYTHING. JUST YESTERDAY ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD THERE WAS A DINNER PARTY. MY WIFE AND I WAS NOT INVITED. APPARENTLY I WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE CONVERSATION. PEOPLE ASKING WHAT'S HAPPENED TO DERSHOWITZ? WHY HAS HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT? AND I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE BECAUSE I YOU WOULD HAVE POINTED MY FINGER AT MY LIBERAL FRIENDS AND SAID IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. IF HAD YOU WORKED THIS HARD FOR THE ELECTION OF HILLARY CLINTON AS I DID AND IF SHE HAD BEEN ELECTED AND THEY WERE TRYING TO IMPEACH OR CHARGE HER, I WOULD BE SAYING EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS IN DEFENSE OF HER RIGHTS. AS I DID IN THE DEFENSE OF THE RIGHTS OF BILL CLINTON AND ALSO IN DEFENSE OF THE RIGHTS OF RICHARD NIXON GOING BACK TO THE 1970S. I HAVE NOT CHANGED. THEY HAVE. Tucker: JUST AS A REFERENCE POINT, YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE DEFENSE FOR A LITTLE WHILE ANYWAY OF O.J. SIMPSON ACCUSED OF KILLING TO TWO PEOPLE WITH A KNIFE. WHEN YOU WENT TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD DURING THOSE YEARS IN 1995 AND 1996, DID PEOPLE ATTACK YOU AT DINNER PARTIES FOR THAT. A LITTLE BIT. NOT AS MUCH AS THIS. NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS. THIS TIME IT INCLUDES SOME OF MY RELATIVES. AS I SAID THE ONLY THING THAT HURTS ME IS THAT UP UNTIL NOW PEOPLE WHO ARE MY RELATIVES WOULD TELL ME OH, PEOPLE COME OVER TO YOU AND SAID YOU ARE RELATED TO ALAN DERSHOWITZ, WOW NOW THEY SAID YOU ARE RELATED TO ALAN DERSHOWITZ HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? SO IT EFFECTS MY RELATIVES. THAT HURTS ME. I HAVE A THICK SKIN. I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS. I HAVE DEVELOPED THE THICKEST SKIN IMAGINABLE. BY THE WAY, A LOT OF THE TWEETS THAT I GET HUNDREDS OF TWEETS AND MESSAGES A LOT OF THEM, NOT ONLY FOCUS ON WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY RELATED TO ME BEING PRO-ISRAEL AND JEWISH AND MAKING ANTI-SEMITIC THING OUT OF IT AS WELL. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NOT ONLY SOME TOO MUCH ANTISEMITISM ON THE RIGHT, THERE IS QUITE A BIT ON IT ON THE ANTI-TRUMP AS WELL. Tucker: I HAVE NOTICED THAT YOU HAVE BEEN AT THIS, I WOULDN'T WANT TO GUESS HALF A CENTURY. FOREFRONT OF THE CIVIL LIBERTARIAN LEFT. HAS THAT GROUP SHRUNK? IS IT NOT JUST TRUMP BUT MAYBE THE LEFT IS LESS INTERESTED IN TRADITIONAL CIVIL LIBERTIES THAN IT USED TO BE? SHRUNK, THERE ARE NO CIVIL LIBERTARIANS LEFT ON THE LEFT. CERTAINLY NOT THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION. THEY WERE THE ONES WHO SAID THAT THE RAID ON COHEN'S OFFICE TAKING HIS LAWYER CLIENT FILES WAS A GOOD THING. NOT EVEN SUGGESTING WHAT I SUGGESTED AND ULTIMATELY ADOPTED BY THE JUDGE TO HAVE A JUDICIAL MONITOR GOING THROUGH. ALL OF THESE EMAILS. THE ACLU IS DEAD IN THE WATER WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF PEOPLE WHO THEY DON'T AGREE WITH. AND THAT'S JUST AWFUL. THERE ARE STILL SOME CIVIL LIBERTARIANS LEFT. BUT YOU CAN COUNT THEM ON ONE HAND. EVERYBODY HAS TO PASS THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT TEST. IF THE SHOE WERE ON THE OTHER FOOT, WOULD YOU BE TAKING THE SAME POSITION YOU ARE TAKING TODAY? I PASSED THAT TEST. THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO PASSED THAT TEST. BUT TOO MANY BOTH ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT DON'T PASS THE TEST. Tucker: I AGREE. WITH HILLARY CLINTON HAD BEEN ELECTED A LOT OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING ME AND DEFINITING ME ON THE RIGHT WOULD BE ATTACKING ME FOR CRITICIZING THE PROSECUTION OR THE IMPEACHMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON. WE NEED NEUTRAL PRINCIPLES. WE NEED STANDARDS OF CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT ARE APOLITICAL AND I REFUSE TO ALLOW PARTISAN POLITICS TO PREEMPT MY VIEWS ON THE CONSTITUTION WHICH HAVE STAYED THE SAME FOR 50 YEARS. Tucker: AMEN. WHEN THE FBI BROKE INTO THE G MAIL ACCOUNT OF THAT CREEPY GOVERNOR ELIOT SPITZER I DEFENDED THAT CREEPY GOVERNOR ELIOT SPITZER. HE IS MY FRIEND. HE WAS MY RESEARCH ASSISTANT. I LIKE ELLIOTT. Tucker: TOTALLY WRONG
