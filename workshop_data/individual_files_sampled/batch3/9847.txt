HE PLEADED GUILTY TO LYING TO THE FBI AS PART OF THE RUSSIAN MIDDLING PROBE. WITH THE MUELLER PROBE LEAKING LIKE A FAUCET, WHERE SHOULD THE INVESTIGATION GO FROM HERE? JIM HANSEN, THANKS FOR JOINING US, WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. A COUPLE BIG LEAKS, ALL THESE QUESTIONS THAT WERE LEAKED REGARDING QUESTIONS THAT WERE ALLEGEDLY GOING TO BE ASKED TO DONALD TRUMP. THE MUELLER PROBE NEEDS TO GO HOME. MUELLER HASN'T FOUND ANYTHING, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE ONE THING HE WAS GIVEN A HUNTING LICENSE TO LOOK FOR AND THAT IS COLLUSION BETWEEN THE PRES. AND THE RUSSIANS IN THE 2016 ELECTION. HE IS NOT GOING TO FIND ANYTHING. HE IS CONTINUING TO HASSLE ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE PRES. AND SOME OF THEM GUILTY OF PETTY CRIMES BUT NONE OF IT BASED ON HIS ACTUAL JOB. HEATHER: WHAT ABOUT THE LIST OF PROPOSED QUESTIONS? THIS WILL INCLUDE MICHAEL FLYNN, JAMES COMEY, COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA, 52 QUESTIONS TOTAL AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WARRANTING MY TIME. I KNOW HE WANTS TO CONFRONT HIS ACCUSER AND CONFRONT THIS INSPECTOR HASSLING HIM FOR A YEAR BUT NEEDS TO REMEMBER THE PRESIDENCY IS WELL ABOVE MUELLER AND GO AHEAD AND NOT TALK TO HIM, TELL HIM HE HAS 30 DAYS TO DROP ANY INDICTMENTS HE MAY HAVE AND THEN PACK HIS BAGS AND GO. HEATHER: WHAT ABOUT THE LEAK OF THIS THREAT FROM MUELLER TO SUBPOENA DONALD TRUMP. WHAT IF THAT HAPPENS? THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD POSITIVELY BE IGNORED. THE PRESIDENCY, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF OUR GOVERNMENT, MUELLER IS A CONTRACT EMPLOYEE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

HEATHER: THE SECOND TOPIC, THE MONEY AND HE RAN. THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TALKED ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE DEAL, THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FOLLOWING, PRES. OBAMA HANDED A LOT OF MONEY OVER THAT WOULD FUNNEL DIRECTLY TO TERRORISTS. WHAT ABOUT THIS MONEY? WHERE IS IT NOW? IN THE HANDS OF SOME OF THE WORST ACTORS IN THE REGION. HEZBOLLAH GOT IT, HAMAS GOT IT, THE BAD GUYS IRAN USES AS THEIR PROXY GOT PAID. OBAMA MADE THE WORST DEAL ANYONE HAS MADE IN MODERN HISTORY. HE DIDN'T GET HIS LUNCH MONEY TAKEN BY THE MUELLERS ON THE PLAYGROUND BUT GAVE WAY HIS PARENTS MORTGAGE AND OUR SECURITY. DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT TO KILL THIS DEAL. HEATHER: THIS $1.7 BILLION CASH PAYMENT MADE TO IRAN BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, $150 BILLION IN UNFROZEN URANIAN ASSETS THANKS TO THE IRAN DEAL? ALL THIS MONEY NEVER MADE IT TO ANYTHING USEFUL IN IRAN. THE PEOPLE IN IRAN CAN'T BUY A DOZEN EGGS FOR LESS THAN THAT, THEIR CURRENCY IS COLLAPSING, THE MUELLERS AND GRAND AYATOLLAH HAVE BEEN SHOVELING THIS MANY TO THEIR OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNTS, ALL OBAMA DID WAS MAKE THINGS WORSE. DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO TAKE THIS DEAL ON THE EAST LAWN, BURN IT AND JOHN BOLTON AND SARAH SANDERS CAN GET AROUND IT AND
