13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,619
at one point that they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and investigate crime hedge funds the</font>

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,020
like mafia investigation experience and

24
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,780
they started trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use wiretaps and</font>

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,910
use informants and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> penetrate</font>

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,280
these networks that way and they were
