1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,170
I stood there were two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were new</font>

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,000
in front of me and I was forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,610
a choice of which one would live it was

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,230
so intense with a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> fein</font>

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,240
responsibility pumping through my veins

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,320
it was something I had experienced

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,750
before and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you've read my film</font>

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">script we know about that but this is</font>

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,100
not something you should get used to is

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,619
an agonizing moment in which for me the

11
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,960
choice wasn't who should live but who

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,409
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> die hey at this moment more than</font>

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,930
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with it feeling so real I</font>

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,790
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely immersed with the stress</font>

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:42,000
and dug deep in my heart for evolution

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,250
impulses informed me that the time was

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,079
against me and I had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a decision</font>

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,140
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in front of me with two people</font>

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,019
I care for deeply trying to weigh<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

20
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,910
pros and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons between them was absurd</font>

21
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,059
and not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did because how can</font>

22
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,789
one do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes to deciding on</font>

23
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,920
who should live if you should pass

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,990
I screams take me take me enough or

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">something along those lines in this</font>

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,060
abstract visionary but impulses replied

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,130
but if I will not to make such a choice

28
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,530
then both would die in such a situation

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,219
is letting both die and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being guilty</font>

30
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,229
of the choice more worthy than to allow

31
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,240
one of them to live and then bearing the

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,929
guilt of letting one slip away after

33
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:39,270
agonizing minutes which seems endless I

34
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,219
knew I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to make a choice even though</font>

35
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,979
I felt sick of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> love both these</font>

36
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,560
people that stood before me I was

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,789
unaware of their thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and emotions</font>

38
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,049
because I was so involved with my own

39
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,759
one of these people being so on I loved

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,009
ever so much whilst the other I hardly

41
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,780
knew yet enough so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much still</font>

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,400
is a situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> no human being should</font>

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,920
ever go through I let the person I

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,350
hardly knew remain alive as the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

45
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,300
hardly knew them would suggest I'd had

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">no right to interfere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with their life</font>

47
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,710
stream sure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one I knew in person and</font>

48
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,980
love so much passed away but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I screamed</font>

49
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,870
I would see them soon and instantly

50
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,690
after the decision I took my own life a

51
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,140
dark dark tragic ending the dream I had

52
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,960
was very intense as you can imagine and

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,520
since I've had a asst got me thinking

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">about issues in life such as there are</font>

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,730
things which the human mind is not meant

56
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,820
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through pressures and tensions</font>

57
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,790
which can be to do with difficult

58
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,700
choices or sometimes there is no choice

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">for people there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are many beliefs behind</font>

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,230
why dreams occur and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

61
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,240
it's a way that your mind prepare

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,940
yourself for future experiences but when

63
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,200
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things in life</font>

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we shouldn't endure I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

65
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,520
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like death because death is</font>

66
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,530
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to endure a some</font>

67
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,840
point it's a part of life and I mean for

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,340
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at different</font>

69
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,650
stages when I was about six I lost a

70
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,320
goldfish and for me I cried when I was

71
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,209
that young it was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time I'd</font>

72
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,670
ever experienced death and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice</font>

73
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,800
apart of growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and then it's</font>

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,620
grandparents it's people that owe you

75
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,810
know very old to you there's that

76
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,940
massive age gap then I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> what she gets</font>

77
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that point in life where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its parents</font>

78
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,450
brothers sisters friends and then

79
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,190
there's the acceptance of the fact that

80
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,980
yourself will die is something that we

81
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,140
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become familiar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with so death</font>

82
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,440
ironically is a part of life but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,330
are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't a part of life</font>

84
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been created by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the human race</font>

85
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,790
itself there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people right now as</font>

86
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,530
we're watching this video you've heard

87
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,000
it many times before who are dying

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,430
because of famine because they've been

89
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,910
born<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a lifestyle in which there</font>

90
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,739
aren't sufficient resources you know

91
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,300
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them there are</font>

92
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,250
people being tortured in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world like</font>

93
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,820
waterboarding there are people who are

94
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,519
boiled alive I mean can you imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

95
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,350
the fact that you are trapped you're not

96
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,020
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated</font>

97
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,959
mainly and there's nothing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do to</font>

98
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,800
escape it if this is endless torture and

99
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,300
there are prisons in the world we're

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,490
living conditions aren't decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

101
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,080
so and he thinks all prisoners should

102
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,900
get their own TV I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

103
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">they go in there and they have to pay</font>

104
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,050
their time once they've committed

105
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,550
something and you know being proven

106
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,920
guilty but I do think they should be

107
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
given as a healthy safe environment

108
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,260
because at the end of the day our

109
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,150
prisons there to rehabilitate and to

110
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,290
help them become a part of society again

111
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,660
if they are to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be released and if they</font>

112
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,160
are to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept there for life then</font>

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,700
surely so be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but for life not for</font>

114
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,410
being tortured there are children in

115
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,360
homes right now who are suffering with

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,950
abuse adults who are suffering with

117
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,830
abuse and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a choice they</font>

118
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,390
can't speak out they don't have the

119
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,730
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> so am I same with this video</font>

120
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,860
because this is all stuff that's been

121
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,750
said before it's on TV all the time and

122
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,570
with repetition I guess people to a

123
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,730
certain extent do get sick of it but I'm

124
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,290
sure the people who are undergoing what

125
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this pain do as well I mean when you see</font>

126
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,370
people on the streets asking for a few

127
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,620
moments of your time I admit to it as

128
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,990
well that sometimes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe cross over</font>

129
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,880
the street I don't want to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part</font>

130
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
of it I mean sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes you may be</font>

131
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,150
busy maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime you don't have time</font>

132
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,180
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point is if you ever do have free</font>

133
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,240
time and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in a free society</font>

134
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,620
now we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a debate again of</font>

135
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,320
what is freedom and are we truly free

136
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,080
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> live a life where we're not</font>

137
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,390
undergoing endless torture we're not

138
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">going under conditions which are hard to</font>

139
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,430
live by and surely this gives us an

140
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,250
opportunity to act and therefore with

141
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,470
our freedom help those that don't have

142
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the freedom and it doesn't mean dedicate</font>

143
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,390
your life completely it just means even

144
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,850
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend five minutes a day five</font>

145
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,990
minutes a week you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's</font>

146
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,120
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more than what you're</font>

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,510
doing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it would make a big</font>

148
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,310
difference I think some people believe

149
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,020
because their life is fine there's no

150
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,850
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> act upon others because</font>

151
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,520
unfortunately deliver the society in

152
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,800
some instances<font color="#CCCCCC"> where people live for</font>

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,570
themselves the whole thing though with

154
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,880
human nature is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

155
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,920
selfish in the sense that we will live

156
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,070
to fulfill our needs if that someone

157
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">does a charitable act you may ask how do</font>

158
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you build a hierarchy and decide where</font>

159

money should go to the chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

160
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,250
probably donate your money to a charity

161
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,420
of maybe a hospital that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is dealing with</font>

162
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,160
a disease which someone in your family

163
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">is died of because you can relate you</font>

164
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,840
empathize it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying it's a selfish</font>

act it's saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> using your self</font>

167
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,900
part in that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess with issues of</font>

168
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,940
whether people don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices in</font>

169
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,830
life or their minds are going free

170
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,690
situations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> human shouldn't be going</font>

171
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,090
through if it was the other way around

172
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,250
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wish tom was out there to</font>

173
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,130
help you<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you know it's obvious that</font>

174
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,140
you'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be the case so even if</font>

175
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,990
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to act you have to see it like</font>

176
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,240
it's an investment you give up<font color="#E5E5E5"> time now</font>

177
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,220
to help these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out there and then</font>

178
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,720
when you're in that situation you'll be

179
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,850
helped because everyone's got that

180
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,210
attitude then take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that attitude because</font>

181
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,980
at the end of the day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow</font>

182
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,290
you so you might avail yourself to do

183
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,030
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I guess what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

184
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,500
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the solution to the</font>

185
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,450
world's and justices there are people

186
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,130
out there who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have power taken out of</font>

187
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,210
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands they are completely</font>

188
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,840
powerless the dream I had isn't specific

189
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,150
to the issue i discuss in this video but

190
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's parked off the thoughts that I have</font>

191
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,640
and what I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put forward so I</font>

192
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,170
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put two things to you my</font>

193
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,690
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is that I've only listed a</font>

194
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,460
few examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which people in the</font>

195
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,310
world are powerless or and they are

196
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,130
going through aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of life in which</font>

197
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,010
their mind shouldn't have to endure such

198
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,510
terror or helpless situations and I want

199
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,360
you to do video responses from own

200
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,590
experiences or maybe just from examples

201
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,910
that come in your head right now and

202
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,430
post about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and let people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

203
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,820
it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's stuff those shock people</font>

204
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,610
you know discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and the second</font>

205
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,490
point I want to say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think and</font>

206
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,669
ask yourself what could actively be done

207
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,059
to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> the powerless in the world of</font>

208
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,799
today as many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

209
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,380
for community and I think whenever st.

210
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,910
comes to mind I'll just put it out there

211
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">and hope that some people can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

212
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">inspired to help more I mean I'm going</font>

213
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be helping more that you know this</font>

214
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,839
dream inspired me and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people</font>

experiences that may inspire me to help

217
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">with other causes just think and I hope</font>
