â™ª

2
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:09,982
PETE: WELCOME BACK.

3
00:00:09,982 --> 00:00:11,116
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN

4
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:12,418
MANAGER BRIEFLY SENT TO JAIL

5
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:14,720
AHEAD OF HIS SEPTEMBER

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,320
TRIAL.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,088
ABBY: OUR NEXT GUEST CALLS

8
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:17,890
THE JUDGE'S MOVE OBNOXIOUS

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,559
TO OUR CONSTITUTION.

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,360
GRIFF: HERE TO EXPLAIN

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,561
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR

12
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,562
EMERITUS, LIFELONG DEMOCRAT

13
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:26,598
AND THE AUTHOR OF "THE CASE

14
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:31,136
AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP"

15
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:31,670
ALAN DERSHOWITZ.

16
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,104
GOOD MORNING.

17
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:33,672
>> GOOD MORNING.

18
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:34,473
GRIFF: WHAT IS YOUR

19
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:34,840
REACTION.

20
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,874
>> THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TODAY

21
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:36,942
IN JAIL BEFORE THEY HAVE

22
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:39,044
BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY CRIME.

23
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:41,914
MANY MINORITIES, NOW PAUL

24
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:43,082
MANAFORT JOINS THEM BASED ON

25
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:44,817
AN INDICTMENT.

26
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:45,617
INDICTMENTS ARE NOT SUPPOSED

27
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:49,388
TO HAVE ANY REAL IMPACT QUI

28
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:51,290
STILL HAVE A PRESUMPTION OF

29
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,657
INNOCENCE.

30
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:53,025
UNDER THE LAW MANAFORT IS NO

31
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,493
MORE GUILTY OF CONTACTING

32
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:55,861
WITNESSES OR ATTEMPTING TO

33
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,196
OBSTRUCT JUSTICE THAN ANY OF

34
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:57,463
US.

35
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:58,230
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS HE DID

36
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,832
IT HE SAYS NO HE DIDN'T DO

37
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:00,566
IT.

38
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:02,101
HE DIDN'T KNOW WITNESSES.

39
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,236
CONVERSATIONS ENTIRELY

40
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,940
WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT GET

41
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,241
TO WIN WITHOUT A HEARING OR

42
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:09,741
TRIAL.

43
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,844
PUT ANYMORE IN JAIL ENORMOUS

44
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:13,378
PRESSURE ON HIM NOT ONLY TO

45
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:15,013
SING BUT PERHAPS EVEN

46
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:16,281
COMPOSE AS ONE OF THE JUDGES

47
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,484
PUT IT I THINK IT'S VERY,

48
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:19,151
VERY UNFAIR.

49
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:20,853
NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN JAIL

50
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,454
TODAY FOR BEING INDICTED.

51
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:23,755
THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS

52
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:24,690
OF PEOPLE.

53
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,357
THERE IS SOMETHING VERY

54
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:26,825
WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM THAT

55
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,594
PRESUMES GUILT THIS WAY.

56
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:29,795
PETE: IS THIS PART OF A

57
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,563
PUBLIC SHOW, A DEMONSTRATION

58
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:33,465
THAT THEY ARE CRACKING DOWN

59
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,067
ON TRUMP, THAT THE NOOSE IS

60
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:35,467
TIGHTENING?

61
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,503
IS THIS PART OF COMPOSING?

62
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:43,008
>> WELL, IT'S PART OF

63
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:43,775
PRESSURE.

64
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:44,610
IF PAUL MANAFORT WERE PART

65
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,511
OF THE CAMPAIGN, NOBODY

66
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:46,812
WOULD HAVE EVER LOOKED INTO

67
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:48,547
HIS BACKGROUND, HIS

68
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:48,914
LOBBYING.

69
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:50,048
NOBODY WOULD BE MONITORING

70
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,150
AND FINDING OUT WHETHER HE

71
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,918
IS CALLING WITNESSES.

72
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,353
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE MOST

73
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:55,053
NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD

74
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:56,321
WHEN YOU ARE UNDER

75
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:57,623
INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF

76
00:01:57,623 --> 00:01:58,757
MAYBE THE WITNESSES SHOULD

77
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:00,292
TELL THE TRUTH.

78
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:00,893
I'M A LAWYER.

79
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:02,594
I KNOW YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED

80
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:02,961
TO DO IT.

81
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,596
BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T

82
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:05,531
UNDERSTAND THAT BEFORE HE IS

83
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:06,732
PUT IN JAIL, THERE SHOULD

84
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:08,500
HAVE BEEN AN EVIDENTIARY

85
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,800
HEARING, A MINI TRIAL IN

86
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,170
WHICH HE COULD PRESENT HIS

87
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,503
DEFENSE.

88
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:12,804
HE COULD CALL WITNESSES.

89
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:14,139
AND ONLY THEN DO YOU PUT

90
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,073
SOMEBODY IN JAIL.

91
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:16,375
YOU CAN GET THE GRAND JURY

92
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,110
TO INDICT A HAM SANDWICH AS

93
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,745
THE CHIEF JUDGE OF NEW YORK

94
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,079
ONCE PUT IT PROSECUTORS JUST

95
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,247
PLAY WITH GRAND JURIES.

96
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,849
THEY TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.

97
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,918
THERE ARE 23 CHAIRS LINED UP

98
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,052
TO BE MOVED AROUND BY

99
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:27,452
PROSECUTORS.

100
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:28,921
AND THE IDEA THAT WE NOW PUT

101
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,923
PEOPLE IN JAIL BASED ON WHAT

102
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,691
A GRAND JURY DOES, HEARING

103
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,226
ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE CASE.

104
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:35,794
NOT THE ONLY SIDE OF THE

105
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:37,829
CASE REALLY IS OBNOXIOUS TO

106
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,264
OUR CONSTITUTION.

107
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:39,932
ABBY: YOUR THOUGHTS, BECAUSE

108
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,300
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

109
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,334
THE IG REPORT ALL MORNING.

110
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,368
WE HAD RUDY GIULIANI ON

111
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:44,536
YESTERDAY AND HE SAYS THEY

112
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:45,804
ARE DOUBLING DOWN AND DON'T

113
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:46,705
WANT TO COOPERATE MOVING

114
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:47,639
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY FEEL

115
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,374
THAT IT WAS TAINTED THAT THE

116
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,543
EARLY DAYS WE NOW KNOW PETER

117
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:52,778
STRZOK LEADING THE EARLY

118
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:53,445
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION DURING

119
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,446
THE CAMPAIGN, NOW WE KNOW

120
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:55,948
HOW HE TRULY FELT ABOUT THE

121
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:58,050
PRESIDENT AND OTHER HIGH UP

122
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,850
AGENTS HOW THEY FELT.

123
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,585
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

124
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:00,953
AND HIS TEAM ARE MAKING THE

125
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:02,187
RIGHT MOVE BY SAYING HOW CAN

126
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:03,589
WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY?

127
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:05,057
WE NOW KNOW THE REAL MOTIVES

128
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:05,824
FROM THE BEGINNING.

129
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,125
>> I THINK THE MORE

130
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,427
IMPORTANT THING IS THE IG

131
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:09,695
REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT

132
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:10,829
THERE WAS JUSTIFICATION FOR

133
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:11,430
FIRING COMEY.

134
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,864
COMEY IS REALLY THE VILLAIN

135
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:13,632
OF THE REPORT.

136
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,501
FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL

137
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,403
BENEFIT, REPUTATIONAL

138
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:18,737
BENEFIT.

139
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:20,072
HE TRIED TO HAVE IT BOTH

140
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:20,372
WAYS.

141
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:21,006
HE THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON

142
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,174
WOULD WIN THE ELECTION.

143
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:25,477
THEREFORE, HE WOULD PROVIDE

144
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:26,845
INFORMATION AGAINST HER AND

145
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,147
THEN IF SHE WON THE

146
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:29,514
ELECTION.

147
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:30,816
THE TRUMP PEOPLE COULDN'T

148
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:31,183
COMPLAIN.

149
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:32,451
IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY

150
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:33,252
DESIGNED TO HELP HIS

151
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,152
REPUTATION AND HE SHOULD

152
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:34,987
HAVE BEEN FIRED.

153
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:36,855
HILLARY CLINTON WOULD HAVE

154
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:37,256
FIRED HIM.

155
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:37,956
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD HAVE

156
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,157
FIRED HIM ON DAY ONE.

157
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:40,792
AND ONCE THE PRESIDENT HAS

158
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,128
SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR

159
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:44,429
ENGAGING IN ACTIONS UNDER

160
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:45,163
ARTICLE 2 OF THE

161
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,465
CONSTITUTION, YOU CAN'T

162
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:47,499
START QUESTIONING HIS

163
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:47,833
MOTIVE.

164
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,700
YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER

165
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,034
REASON.

166
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,035
WAS HE HAPPY THAT HE WAS

167
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:51,069
FIRED SO THAT THE RUSSIA

168
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,304
THING COULD COME TO AN END?

169
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:54,139
ONCE WE START PROBING THE

170
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,274
MOTIVATIONS OF PRESIDENTS,

171
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:58,210
WE ARE DOING LAW BY PSYCHO

172
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,779
ANALYSIS RATHER THAN LAW BY

173
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:01,113
ACTIONS.

174
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:01,980
ALL RIGHT, PROFESSOR, THANK

175
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,247
YOU.

176
00:04:02,247 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE
