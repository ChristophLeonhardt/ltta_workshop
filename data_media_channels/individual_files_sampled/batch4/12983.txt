to the Ben Shapiro Sunday special thanks for coming by it's just great to be here I'm really excited to talk Bible with you because we have to bring some holiness back to the set last week we had Sam Harris and his blasphemy on the set so now we get to have video to do exactly Dennis Prager and his godly views on the said today Dennis obviously if you haven't been watching the news you haven't followed the Amazon charts as the author of the bestseller the rationale Bible the book of Exodus so he's gonna do all five volumes of the of the Old Testament the books of Moses and he's done Exodus it was a huge bestseller sold tens of thousands of copies as number one in the nonfiction list on amazon.com which has to be really gratifying since you've written a bunch of best-selling books but this one is actually a Bible commentary so let's start from beginning what actually made you think hey I'll write a Bible commentary and then just release that out into the world well the interesting among the interesting things is and it's great to be with you been among the interesting things is that of all the books I wrote this is the one I least expected to be a best-seller this was written 100% out of idealism they're all idealistic books but but there was a hope and in some of them were bestsellers but this has been the best-selling book I ever wrote and it's the last one I expect that I wrote a book on happiness on American values I mean some good stuff but what whatever credit I get I think 50% of the reason is that there is a thirst for exactly that namely I want I'd like to actually know what the Bible has to say I want it to be rational which is my entire approach and there's a thirst that look this is the most biblically illiterate generation in American history as you know as well as anyone the average American home throughout American history if it had one book it had the Bible they read it to their kids every night this was the source of wisdom what is i√≠ve asked callers on 33 years of radio said I'd like to know if it's not the Bible just name a book that is the source of wisdom for you and it's fascinating you know what people say if they don't have this uh life experience let me go yeah but then everybody has to reinvent the wheel do you mean there's nothing that precedes you that had more wisdom than maybe you do anyway I know it's the wisest book I am convinced of it and making it rational verse by verse it's been my life's task I know the Hebrew real well I don't as you do and you know it you grit there are wonderful commentaries that don't by people who don't know Hebrew but I think to really do it right you have to know the Hebrew so let's let's start from the very beginning of the the basis for the rationale Bible because I think that you can make a really solid argument that the ethics that the Bible promotes the ethical monotheism that you promote this is based on on a certain level of human rationality in a little while I want to talk about human rationality versus God's rationality will do the rib for a problem which stands above which but let's start with the basis of Revelation so when you say that the Bible is rational do you mean that Revelation itself can be rationalized that it is rational that a voice came down from the top of a mountain and then to give a bunch of laws to a do to his staff so you got to go step by step is it rational to believe that there's a creator I think as the late Charles Krauthammer said when I asked him I cuz I never asked him about politics I figured everybody could hear him on politics but so I asked him about other things and I asked him he was in he was a totally secular man so said what do you think of atheism and I thought he'd said well and maybe so I I don't know he said he said that's the most foolish of all possible possibilities said it's absurd I mean he was he dumped on atheism more than I have so to me that there's a creator is purely rational so then the that's purely rational this didn't come out by itself this world this universe you mean buck it just didn't happen by chance okay then any point of faith or is there a rational no no that's purely rational I'll tell you where faith comes in that God is good there's so much bad in the world that I admit there's a leap of faith to believing that the Creator is good it's no leap of faith to a creator I believe there's a leap of faith to God is good but once you've made that leap that God is good which I think is somewhat rational after all why would a bad creator make it make a person capable of being good it's a bizarre sort of situation so if the Creator cares how we live then the Creator will give us guidelines those guidelines are in the Bible that's how I look at it okay so let's define good so when you say that God is good what do you mean by God is good because obviously you don't mean God is good by human moral standards because then that would put us that is the rip throw a problem right that puts us above God is God living up to our standards and if so why do we need God morality because there's a mixture of God's standards and our standards otherwise we can't understand anything if it's purely divine then we can't understand it when Abraham the first monotheists the first Jew argues with God which by the way is one of the reasons I'm in love with these first five books what what is called the Torah I mean I and I mean it I'm in love with those books ever since I was a kid and I'm not the most traditional guy but that I fell in love with and I love the idea that you can argue with God I tell I tell Chris all the time that's largely another huge Christian audience and I am a Jew and I am I explain don't forget Israel God's people has a meaning it means argue with or struggle with God and a lot of Christians forgot that and a lot and you know and secularists don't even know that there's something beautiful about that let me can I consider a quick anecdote a Muslim woman called my radio show many years ago when I was just on in LA and she said Dennis I know you we could ask you anything I said that's right well I'm a Muslim woman and I'd like to know why aren't you a Muslim and I was right old her I want you to know I am complimented by the fact that you would even ask it means you think I've given this theory a serious thought and I have so I said to her here's my answer Islam in Arabic means submit to God Israel in Hebrew means struggle with God I rather struggle with God than submit to God there was a moment of silence and she said good answer and hung up she knew as a Muslim I was right that is a huge difference so that so the fact that we can argue with God means that we can perceive God's morality so when I say God is good it is both in his terms am i believe our terms so when it comes to that standard of good there there are two main sources in Western civilization for the standard of good one is the Bible did you do Christian tradition and the other is this idea of natural law these see reflected a lot in the founding philosophy it's it's reflected as well in into mystic thought this idea that you can look at the universe and you can discern from the universe that there are certain things that are true and certain things that are false so for example you're an advocate for traditional marriage and the natural law of view of marriage would be exactly this that God created man and woman to be together and the proof of this that they are capable of producing children so what when we're trying to discern the good do we need revelation or natural all alone suffice and or are they mirrors of one another or is natural law itself irrelevant so there are two questions there do we need God pregnant eclis do we need God philosophically you're asking philosophically I'm more concerned with the pragmatic because that's how we live right we we practice we live but I look clearly if we needed revelation from the beginning God would have revealed the Torah as it were or the Ten Commandments to Adam and Eve so clearly God believes it's possible to be good without his direct revelation otherwise it's not fair to have blamed came for killing Abel right Cain could have said hey hello you didn't give me any rules what the hell am I supposed to know but he didn't say that so yes there's clearly an embedded conscience I do believe that the problem is it doesn't work well and so I always say the Ten Commandments are God's third attempt at trying to start trying to get us to be good people and and and choosing a people to be to embody holiness and goodness which was the what is known is Israelite and then ultimately doing so that's that's that then there's the pragmatic question that's the more the one I strike and not struggle with but that's the one I advocate more I begin my introduction which and enough itself is a booklet because I introduction is very important what I'm trying to do and whom are trying to appeal to and I begin with a very revealing part of my own life like many people in my late teens and early 20s and even early teens I had difficulties with my parents what what else is new right but I always honored them always from the day I left my parents home at 21 till they died my father at 96 my mother at 89 I called them every single week I it didn't matter where I was on earth and the reason was one because I believe God instructed me honor your father and mother and when I tell people who say oh I don't need God to be good really then how come so many adult kids who are angry at their parents don't don't call them every week believe me we can all use a commander in heaven to tell us what to do so when it comes to that back to the philosophical question for one second so to play skeptic since you're rational Bible guy so what took God so long why'd he need three attempts why does he wait until the the revelation at Sinai great question and I I have dealt with that in my in my mind my whole life to show us why it was necessary that's why to show us hey hello conscience alone doesn't work look at how bad man got because otherwise if if God had given the Ten Commandments the the Bible the Torah or whatever in the beginning was who needs it conscience would be enough but conscience failed and we ended up with the world of Noah which God destroyed and by the way I defend Noah that Genesis is coming up I do defend God God wants us to be good and if everybody's bad he's gonna start again I haven't debate with my wife you're gonna love this my wife thinks he shouldn't have saved Noah my wife thinks the world is so screwed up that it was very dark she is as light as the Sun in personality but a herd view of Linda call that one I know you would exactly so so with all of that said I you know to her for a lot of folks who read the Bible they don't know a lot about the Bible and maybe their first experience with reading the Bible is gonna be reading your book when you read the text of the Bible there's a lot in there that unquestionably is brutal and that seems to our modern sensibilities just bizarre it's it seemed the Bible contemplating witchcraft for example or the Bible or the Bible endorsing quasi slavery this is an argument that Sam Harris gave me last week as he was saying well you know this book this book you could do better than this book today like if you just remove certain sections from this book and they would automatically make it better so what's all this stuff in the Bible about all right first of all since the by first volume is about Exodus I have an enormous amount on the slavery issue right the first thing to be said is there's very little slavery what it what is what what the laws are about is essentially a bonded indenture which by the way is the way so many people came to America people don't know that but a vast number of the white people who came to the United States came as indentured servants they've got no pay they started out life working for somebody for no pay which you can call a slave if you wish but they didn't and by the way as I know you know the word and Hebrew for slave is also the word for servant it's an and I wish I wish there had been a distinction in Hebrew because Moses is called and an airbed of God that's the word and and is Moses a slave of God nobody assumes that so it's not at all always slave it is but if you look at although first you cannot return an escaped slave that's a law in the taurah a law there in exodus you if something that was immediately a statement of hey you mistreat your slave and they escaped you're not getting your slave back you kill your slave you get killed i mean your slave has to has to have a day off with you on the sabbath every week I mean this is major stuff why didn't it just say no slavery because it wants the world to be better it's not the Torah is not preoccupied and I'm using the word Torah cuz this is about the vows five books about it but my commentary is for people of every faith in no faith but if there is a realization that you can't ban all bad immediately maybe the Torah wanted us to be vegetarian so a hundred years from now and I think most people will be vegetarian people will sit like a Sam Harris and say well why don't it ban meat-eating instead it humanized meat-eating it moralized it that's what it did to whatever slavery it had it humanized it because you can make the world better much more so through evolution than revolution okay so in just a second I want to ask you about the religious objections to applying rationality to the Bible because so far we've dealt with sort of the rationalist objections to the Bible itself and then I want to come at it from the right as opposed to from the left but first let's talk about your death because it's gonna happen 71% of people say they need life insurance only 59% have coverage which means at least 12% of people are procrastinating the truth is you all need life insurance cuz y'all gonna die sorry to break it to you and that means you don't have as much time as you think you do procrastinating is normally a bad thing but if you've been avoiding getting life insurance procrastinating may actually have worked in your favor because while you're putting it off policy genius was making it easy

zero hassle it's free policy genius com when it's this easy to compare life insurance there's no reason to put it off go check it out a policy genius com okay so by the way I just want to add on your behalf that I tell my listeners that life insurance is a moral obligation well that's perfect so policy genius life insurance is a moral obligation Dennis Prager said so you can take it to the bank so let's talk about the the sort of skepticism of applying reason to the Bible from the right so so far we've talked about you know people on sort of the secular left or just secularism in general who would be skeptical about the Bible itself there are a lot of folks in the religious community of the play the community I grew up in the community you grew up in who would say that attempts to apply rationality to the Mitzvah to the the commandments of the Torah is actually counterproductive because now you're placing man above God and what you are doing is infusing a need you're implying that God needs man in a way that that is not true that God gives a certain level of commandment and now we're trying to reason around it but as soon as we start using our reason reason also is is a universal acid to a certain extent you can reason your way to anything so if you start off with a commandment here and you say okay well take for example slavery and we say okay well we've reasoned our way to slavery is bad using the beginning point of the of the Bible why couldn't we reason our way to something else why couldn't we reason our way to slavery is universally good based on the Bible because reason doesn't have a lot of limits to it so what rules of Reason ought we apply that will prevent the destruction of the rules themselves so if you think that the mitzvot are important if you think the commandments are important then either you know which ones don't well let me explain on a personal note my vehicle to God is his reason I don't have a great bond with God - I wish I did I don't my vehicle to God is reason my vehicle to faith is reason my vehicle through religious life is reason so I can't I can't be what I'm not that that if someone doesn't care about reason then they they won't find my book interesting but we live in an age where almost everything has to be rationally explained I like that fact I think it's good and there was a book written when I was a kid called we have reason to believe by by an English rabbi Louis Jacobs and it's it's it I I'm embarrassed to say I didn't read the whole book and I but I am equally embarrassed but I will tell you the truth the title changed my life the title I can't say that about any other book it was a brilliant double entendre we have reason to believe the obvious is there are reasons to believe but the the the secondary meaning was we have been given reason in order to believe and that is what I felt at 20 and I feel today that reason is my vehicle so let me give you a personally good example there is a law in in the Torah that says if you have a particularly unruly child a terrible son you take him to the court and if they find him guilty they stone him to death and people use that as a great example of how primitive the the Bible is though the Torah specifically I used reason to realize wait a minute way way way way wait that law is was a moral genius that was the first law in human history to take away a parent's right to kill their child that's what the law did no child was ever killed in Jewish history by a court but what they did was what the Torah did was parents you're still in charge but wait a minute you can't kill your child only a court can so what it did was it maintained parental authority but took away forever their right to kill their child so it was a staggering moral advance I show that with every difficult law in the Torah okay so how do you tell which are the moral advances that we need to move beyond and which are the moral advances that's as far as we go so to take an example you suggest that let's use the one you just used just to take the counterpoint so your your argument is that this is a movement away from parents being able to kill their children willy-nilly and so you have a court process that's put in place specifically to prevent all of this so the goal of the commandment is to prevent the fulfillment of the commandment to a certain extent so now take the commandment with regard to the one that's popular today with regard to homosexuality for example how do we know that that wasn't just a progressive attempt to move away from something worse but the really progressive thing would be to say that what it's really talking about is we're moving toward monogamy for male couples or female couples which is the way that some people in in sort of liberal congregations try to reinterpret that phrase in other words where does reason stop and we say okay we've gone far enough and where do we say okay well this commandment was written for the time and it was determined to drag people out of a certain level of primitivism and now we can drag them even further out of that level of primitivism I am that's in the third book of the Bible Leviticus I devote 20,000 words to that verse and this is the gist of it the gist is this I thought before I did my research and I'm sure everyone thinks this that the Bible simply codified what every other society believed and that is homosexuality is bad end of issue it turns out and I learned this from from homosexual scholars and pro homosexual Pro gay scholars I this is not from me every society in the world except for biblical Society said that homosexuality was good this was a total revelation ancient China ancient Incas ancient Egyptians ancient Greeks you anywhere on earth I read a book by a Harvard professor and you know is not my favorite reading I'm and it's not only because it's it's very it's very involved obviously on ancient Chinese homosexuality so this was the rule like in ancient Greece women were for babies boys were for fun the Torah did set it the opposite the Torah said wives are for fun the Torah in that law Hirata sized marriage it was a staggering revolution in human history so I even even accepting your logic that let's let's take the laws of Sabbath to take a less controversial example so there are certain laws of Sabbath that have been stricken made strict over time right that we you and I disagree on the interpretation of Sabbath for example you know you'll you'll drive on Saturdays I won't drive on Saturdays because there's a rabbinic tradition that you don't drive on Saturdays so right by the way I don't drive just I wouldn't drive through a ballgame I don't dropping I Drive to a Sabbath exactly okay right now yeah I don't want to miss yeah all right so right but the question is at least from the Orthodox point of view or from a fundamentalist point of view so how does orthodoxy not slip into reconstruction ISM or into reform so which which was you get to abrogate and which laws do not get that well for one thing I I don't think we can change torah law torah law I believe the Torah is ultimately from God whether it was all given at one time or not even the rabbi's themselves differed on on when exactly was it through prophets was it later was it doesn't matter to me who wrote it is it more important to me than how it was written I believe it's a divine document that is if I didn't I would never have spent this time and I wouldn't take it seriously I believe it is a divine document so I don't believe that that not using spark plugs is divine I will acknowledge that it is rabbinic if you're asking me from an Orthodox Jewish perspective and by the way Orthodox Jews love the commentary as they should yeah it brings people to great faith and I want that but it is true that I think rabbinic law can change I do believe that as for Torah law for example I don't smoke my or a cigar which I do every day of the week I don't do it on on Shabbat because it says do not burn a fire on the Sabbath so I just want to make that clear I take this stuff very seriously and by the way I show you would let you'll love this I show and it took a lot of research why it why is fire the aside from the guy who what is because she hates even be the guy who picks up the sticks on see ya well a big one little sticks or whatever it is si fer the the the issue is only fire why it is fire what's the big deal on fire on the Sabbath fire is the only thing outside of making a baby that we do ex nihilo and so fire represents creation and the Sabbath's purpose is to not create to imitate God and rest and not create one day a week so and my proof is you are not banned from fire on the Jewish holy days other than the Sabbath that became a rabbinic law later we but in the Torah itself only on the Sabbath because the the holy days Passover Tabernacles and and Pentecost Shavuot Sukkot and Pesa do not represent creation but this does anyway this sounds a lot of trend of alluded I'm sure to a lot of work or at least complex it's not I make things very clear but yes III admit that there are laws that you know III believe that a that a dish that has been put in boiling water has effectively gotten rid of its prior of foods and can be eaten from but you know look I know that the Orthodox within jewelry the Orthodox are my allies I know that and by the way the Orthodox invited me to speak knowing that I'm not Orthodox to their great credit every year Passover for its that's right that's a perfect exactly so let's talk about why so why the Bible um so what is the proof that the Bible is the best moral system as opposed to other divinely ordained moral systems how do you how do you make that judgment because you're not a comparative theologian per se you don't mean you spend time reading about other religion but oh yes from what I understand you don't consider yourself an expert on on various other religion so why why this religion in particular the obvious answer is the fruit the United States of America was not founded only by Orthodox Christians in other words not every founder believed in the Trinity but every founder believed that the Bible was the greatest book ever written including Jefferson and Franklin and and Lincoln it's the one book he had a midden go to church much but he had the book this the there are people who believed in the Bible who did a lot of evil there's no question about that but people did evil everywhere so the only question mature people ask is not why was there evil anywhere it's why was there good anywhere it's not like why was there poverty that's the norm why is there any affluence that's the only question that intelligent people should ask and the answer is capitalism capitalism is the only thing that creates after once the Bible was the only thing that created moral society so when it comes to when it comes to God you've made the argument that you can be a moral person without God is an individual poor you can't build a moral system without God so so can you explain that a little bit for people who have yes of course you know look there are good people who believe in anything there were good people who believed in Zeus but nobody would argue that Zeus made good people that that's the point of course there are good people who believe in nothing they believe in anything of course that's true and there are bad people who believe in God I say that every time and yet all over the internet you will find Prager says that you can't be good if you don't believe in God and I've never said it in my life I'd have to be stupid to say it there were good atheists how many times can I say it the answer is there's no limit because they don't want to hear it but you can't build a good Society without God you can have good individuals we care you care I care all of us should care about what kind of society we make this country there's a reason there's a map there are three mottos a pluribus unum Liberty and In God We Trust okay that's pretty important with with that and and Franklin did not believe we could have a good society without God Franklin's in autobiography his theology and I just read Thomas kids book on Franklin's theology just to make sure he's identical to mine identical God exists God will judge all of us that's what I believe that's what Franklin believed and Franklin is called so called deist theist is not what people think theist means these most people think is like Aristotle the unmoved mover a creator and then the creator went to sleep or retired to another universe that is not what they were they believe they simply weren't Orthodox small o in their Christianity but they believed in Providence in the God who judges and that God had a role in the founding of America ok so I want to talk in a minute with you about death because we've talked a lot about sort of the life-affirming qualities of rationality and

good or bad the the Torah doesn't have a lot about the afterlife actually the five books of Moses are pretty vague on on exactly what happens when you die there there are a few sort of vague references or allusions to it the idea that you know God kisses Moses and and Moses go somewhere but you're not really sure where and the there's obviously in various different theologies whole worlds built up around what happens after we die so number one what do you believe about what happens after we die number two where does that come from in the Bible and number three do you actually need to believe in the afterlife in order to be good okay so one at a time one of the 850 reasons I'm in love with the Torah I said I'm not in love with God I admit it I wish I were as I've written actually an essay that the hardest the law and the Torah is to love God with all your heart but with all the suffering in the world I I admit it I find it I find it hard not I hope I'll achieve it one day but I do love the Torah ironically I really I'm in love with it I admit it and one of the things I'm in love of is its reticence to talk about much about the afterlife because life is so hard and has been for the vast majority of people it's very easy to focus on the afterlife and ignore this world God wants us to make this world heavenly not heaven that's not possible and not to think about heaven all that much however I will tell you there is no doubt in my mind that the Torah believes in the afterlife and I will give you two proofs one is that about of six people it says when they died they they were gathered unto their people or their kin four of the six people it says it about we're not buried with kin or family four of the six so being gathered to their kin cannot possibly be about where they're buried secondly it says before they were ever buried so the act of dying itself means you are gathered to your kin I don't know any other read other than you there there was a soul that gathers with with those that preceded you there is no other I think fair read to that verse number two is not my argument it's Richard Elliot Friedman who's not an Orthodox Jew but he is a but he is also a very serious scholar of the Bible world his own commentary and he made this this the following argument I believe was in an email to me I'm not know if he actually wrote it up he might have and and he said given that the Torah is so preoccupied with rejecting ancient Egypt Egypt's values because that's where the Hebrews grew up right in ancient Egypt and it's you know like all the plagues but one are against the gods of Egypt so it's all a rejection of ancient Egypt but he said the biggest belief in ancient Egypt was the afterlife the Torah could have easily just said reject everything about Egypt including the belief in an afterlife but it said nothing the biggest belief in Egypt is not contradicted in the Torah so that's a second reason it is clear the Torah believes in it but it doesn't want us to be preoccupied with the afterlife the guys who believe they're going to get 72 virgins for blowing innocent people up are preoccupied with the afterlife okay the Torah is afraid of that and for good reason now you asked another a part the part three on that one right is that okay okay good so part three is do we have to believe in an afterlife to be good people or they say there's a good moral system well I would put it this way without belief in an afterlife it would be so obvious to me that God was not good that I would disregard anything that I thought this God said I would if I didn't believe in an afterlife I'd be an atheist because if God is good there's an afterlife I mean because it's so obvious torturers go have the same oblivion as their tortured mother Teresa goes the same places Adolf Hitler what kind of crappy world is this deity make I don't want anything to do with him I rest my my whole case for a belief and and for sanity on the afterlife I admitted I fully admitted that I their item for those interested there's a five minute preview video on the afterlife which I happened to give I don't get most of the preview videos but I you give I give good people give and and there's a five minute case for just for the afterlife but I I fully admit it and I know I'm mocked for this I don't give a damn but I mocked for it a good part of my sanity rests on the belief that there is a just God and if there was a just God there's an afterlife okay so let's talk about where the United States seemingly has gone wrong in all of this because we become a significantly less religious people if you go back to the 1950s the vast majority of Americans were going to church on a regular basis if you look at the United States now that is that it's just not the case anymore the the religious numbers particularly among people my age have declined markedly it's a much more secular country what happened why is it that religion seems to have lost its it's sort of appeal maybe it's coming back and we'll talk about that in a second we'll talk about whether you're a pessimist in a second but what happened in the 1950s 60s 40s why exactly was it that this religious worldview that gave birth to the greatest country in the history of the world decide people just decided to toss it overboard because the the generation that's called the greatest generation the world war ii generation which was a great generation greatest or not they were great they made one horrible mistake they didn't teach their kids what made America tick and part of it was the Bible they they were so preoccupied with making sure their kids didn't have a depression I don't mean psychological depression I mean economic depression and that they wouldn't know war that's all they wanted peace and prosperity that's all that generation ended up caring about so they taught their kids nothing about America and nothing about God and the Bible and the results are the chaos that we see today where teachers can't even call their kids boys and girls because of this true the ultimate arash of denying that there was male and female in the human species by the way I will say this I wrote an essay many years ago it's on the internet how I found God in Colombia then I went back to Colombia and gave this speech and I I mean it sincerely seeing the moral idiocy that pervades the universities which are clearly the dumbest of our institutions I believe that literally I'm I wish I could I I didn't believe it they are also the the most godless institutions in Western civilization Columbia where I learned nonsense in graduate school Columbia made me realize the genius of a line that you know well wisdom begins with fear of God and that changed my life one day walking through Columbia I remember I asked myself why am i learning that men and women are not basically different that they're basically the same this is ridiculous how am i learning I was at the School of International Affairs how am i learning that the US and the Soviet Union were moral equivalence that's what I was being taught that they were just two superpowers struggling it out it wasn't a battle between liberty and and and evil it was it was a battle between two superpowers and then I realized oh my god there's no wisdom at Columbia cuz there's no God of Columbia I got to believe in God thanks to the irrationality of secularism so how do we restore any sort of biblical value is there a way to draw people back to it I think there is a you know I've seen my own life I think there are people who are in search of something eternal and meaningful because they're looking around the system being presented by what is left of our of our moral leadership and saying this is a shambles and they're looking for something that actually has some eternal value to it are you optimistic or pessimistic that's going to happen and how is the best way for religious leaders have an impact and in driving that I'm not optimistic and I'm not pessimistic I wish I could say I'm optimistic but there was a I was in a major discussion a dialogue years ago with a great Catholic thinker and a great Protestant thinker and I was the Jew not saying I'm a great thinker but I do and one of them made a very powerful point the Catholic actually is Robert Novak who just passed the way he was and and and he was great and he and he said a very important thing he said Dennis and I are the pessimists because I'm from Eastern Europe and he's a Jew we know how bad things can get the Protestant god bless him doesn't know how bad things can get and I've told this to Protestant audiences frequently and they they have agreed that they they never looked at it that way I didn't look at it that way the Robert Novak brought it to my attention so I I'm not optimistic and I'm not pessimistic I can only say that a big part of the failure is religious people they did not make the case for the moral and an intellectual necessity of religion they relied on a lot of cliches they're nice people but they they didn't know what to do that's the reason I feel so committed to this five-volume work and and the fact that it is a big bestseller I guess believe it or not not personally but it gives me some reason for optimism III don't know the answer but I know I know we have to get the message out this is the best thing going and America will die and the West will die without this so dennis has a bunch of things that you do obviously you know Bible you have Prager you which has reached hundreds of millions of people at this point with with your vit with your various videos you have your radio show as well a lot of what you do is politically driven it's not just values driven it's it's politically driven as well so how do you how do you merge how do values play into its politics how much of your of your politics is driven by biblical concern as a true person so is it but a person and yet you're not a theocratic that's correct so not at all I that's the founders of this country of the United States of America were giants they came up with a line that is so awesome God wants us to be free they merged liberty and God most religious life Christian or or any or or or or any other did not merge liberty and religiosity this country is unique and we're blowing it and that's I'm going crazy over that this is the last best hope of man Lincoln was right and it's being blown and and you know where it started this is the irony of ironies because they didn't give phd's in America so in the late 19th century scholars in America went to Germany of all places to get their PhDs and there's a basic rule in life Germany is always wrong it's it's I'm sorry to say because I have such close German friends and that I'm music but I'm sorry is that low yes I act I end my essay but never on Germany it's on the internet but thank you for bas exactly that's exactly right I mean but even Merkel I mean she she's blew it she just blew it I think it so they these are the Bismarck gave us socialism not Marx and Marx was German too but but anyway this so these people get their PhDs in in the socialist universe this atheist universe of the German University come back to America and the rest is history so let's talk a little bit about you know that the modern political tenor there are a lot of people who complain right now that morality and politics seems to be completely foreign to one another and I have a lot of sympathies toward sort of that position not in terms of the the positions being espoused because obviously you and I think agree on 99.9 percent of all things political but with regard to sort of the the way the politics is being carried on whether it's people costing each other in restaurants and screaming at them or whether it is some of the president's tweets there's there's a feeling that morality has sort of gone by the wayside how much of biblical values and morality is character and how much of it is public policy when it comes to and when it comes to politics because this was a big argument obviously in 2016 it'll be a big argument again I assume this is all right so this'll blow your mind I raised my boys to believe that character was more important than anything I'm one of the few Jewish parents who didn't give a damn about my kids grades I mean didn't give a damn I I couldn't care less all I wanted was good kids because I really do believe character uber alles that character ultimately will determine their lives and whether they go to this college or that college or no college is secondary to the their character and having said that I don't really care about Donald Trump sins so it sounds like a contradiction this is the most important value I thought to my kids and then the President of the United States I'm saying it's secondary and that's but I live with that I live with that conjunction and ironically part of it is that I got a lot of my wisdom if I have any from the Bible God uses King David who makes let I mean Donald Trump look look safely I mean Donald Trump didn't have any husband killed so he could sleep with the wife let's be honest King David did and and then God chooses who does God choose of all the Canaanites who does God choose to be the one to help the Israelites get into Canaan a prostitute it's almost the Bible's in God's Way of saying listen I could take these sexual sinners and I could use them for good and I emphasize the word sexual sin because I think that a lot of religious people place too much emphasis on sexual sin beyond all the other areas of life I think that's a problematic issue weren't worthy another hour one day but but it's a it's a big it's a big deal anyway I so I care more about America than I care about the character of a president okay so let me let me give you the counter-argument so the counter-argument is not that the policy that the president espouses doesn't matter because obviously I'm very happy with a lot of president Trump's policies I think the country is winning because of a lot of president Trump's policies but there are externalities to public character meaning that you're right I don't care all that much about Donald Trump's peccadilloes in the past because whatever it doesn't affect the public discourse I think in any serious way but when the president says things that are vile about people publicly or when the president says that you know if people come to his protest and they make trouble you know punch them in the face or whatever it is when this sort of stuff happens it from from a character perspective not only does it have a problem create a problem I think for the country it also creates a problem for a lot of Christians who are tempted to start saying King David instead of just saying being Nathan saying like right that's wrong you're not allowed to do that like it's tempting to play God in the King David story and say right he's King David as opposed to well God gets to pick who King David is it's our job to say right you're not allowed to take that guy's husband and said that woman's husband said mouths the battlefield to get killed so that we can repent right so I think that what's happened one of the things that I think is driving apart the country is it's not a referendum on on the president so much as it's a referendum on evangelical Christians and religious Jews and people who are overlooking at least publicly some of the president's sins in order to maintain a level of I think emotional support because I think you can intellectually support what the president's on policy and still say Rebbie Jackson the schmuck right here and and it's that it's that gap that I think is really driving away young people particularly with regard to President Trump well I I don't want it to be driven away i i mean i'm i am you know this is when you said we agree on 99.9 percent this might be the point one where we have a difference i I admire the religious community for sticking with Donald Trump I have defended them in writing a great deal whether it's whether it's religious Christians or Jews because they understand what's at play here the the fate of the United States of America the last best hope of humanity is is at risk here I'm not saying they shouldn't vote for him mind you I'm not saying they should it's so fine so look when he sins should they should they say that was bad what he just did yes that's fine but but it and and many do but they they try to keep a perspective and this is where I know I am NOT for saying this I believe there's a civil war in the United States there is no joy in my saying this I've said this for years now I pray that it remains nonviolent I don't know if it will I think there's a lot of people on the Left who if they could get away with it would hurt physically hurt people on the right and more so than the other way around as Alan Dershowitz Hillary Clinton port a lifelong Democrat lifelong liberal said to me and it is on it's on video in his apartment in Manhattan last year he said let me tell you something as a Jew as an American as a liberal I don't fear a handful of Nazis they mean nothing I fear the far left and that's how I feel and and the far left is taking out Nazis and not taking over the Republican Party that's an absurdity it's it's a libel it's stupid but the far left is taking over their Democratic Party so there's a civil war and I am NOT going to spend my time criticizing the only guy who has saved me from losing the country because there been any other Republican and by the way I was against him I was and it's all in print I was against him during the entire primary I said I but I said from my first article if he wins the the nomination I'll support him because there's no choice but that there is there is such a war at stake right now nobody else would have defeated Hillary Clinton he was the only one I believe I don't think Ted Cruz would have I don't think Marco Rubio would have I don't believe Jeb Bush would have and and that was the brink Supreme Court wise values wise you name it that was the brink for this country so in light of that a moronic tweet or at or an awful statement is is is very small the question is my bigger issue I guess the question is why does that always have to be contextualized meaning I think I can agree with I can agree with virtually every word she just said they're right but the question that I have is that the next the next election the biggest single voting block is going to be Millennials it's going to be younger people and those people actually take his tweet seriously they actually when when he does something that when he says something they find bio that actually matters to them even more so than the policy in many cases and what matters even more than that is is I think so many people on the right who seem to refuse to acknowledge I just don't see why you can't do both I don't see why you can't say his policies are great I'm thrilled with his policies and I wish you would stop doing that or it would be better if you'd stop doing that or what he just said was on our veg and be better off as a country he hadn't done that but that doesn't mean I'm going to turn over country to this bunch outside if you but you've just contextualized it and that's great if you put that in that concept they listen I can't stand what he just said but frankly the policies are saving the country no there isn't anybody who supports him who would differ with you right the only the only problem is that by saying but what is the the point of the contextualisation I mean contextualization to you and to the audience you can make the transition Roy problem is that if let's say he says something about Charlottesville and it's something that I want we may have a difference of understanding and I have perused this a tremendous number of times he didn't say they were good Nazis and-and-and he said there are good people on both side a night on the Friday night wasn't that about statues the Friday night was he White's okay do you think he was saying that there were good Nazis do you believe he's saying there were no to you for marching not the Nazis I think what he was saying is that they were marching with it now here's my here's my schedule against that he didn't say that okay because he doesn't believe there's good anti far known I think that I think the easy way for him to say things is there's good people on both sides right but he doesn't believe there's any good and I'm not sure that he thinks things through it's the extent necessary okay whether he does or does the point is not Charlottesville and I'm happy now are you Charlotte so he can go back through the text and we'll bring out our Tamil and we can actually look look through the legislative history of what he said but any anything that he said that people find distasteful particularly or that you would find distasteful in any other context why can't we just say that's distasteful so for here's a good example he just went and he met with kim jeong-hoon he was extraordinarily warm toward kim jeong-hoon he said really nice things about a guy who was a dictator of 25 million people or so he's one of the worst people on planet earth right and the President of the United States said he's a strong guy running one in 10,000 people could do this sort of thing right and as somebody who studied the former Soviet Union you I'm sure you look at this and you go well a hold up a second here Ron so why can't we just say that and then when it comes time for 2020 say right and the overall opinion is I'll vote for him anyway because that's that but not every day is a referendum on the election this is this I guess is my my main point of criticism because you and I are probably gonna vote the same way in 2020 right the chances are very good that I vote for president or or this year right in 2020 in 2018 we'll certainly both the same right I'm going to vote Republican in 28 yes in 2020 there's a very high likelihood I'll vote for president Trump barring some sort of cataclysmic event right okay all of that said I do think that there is something deeply important about conservatives pointing out when he does something wrong because otherwise we lose our intellectual credibility and learn as though it is our job to become his lawyers as opposed to being advocates for a position for which he is not I understand that and it makes sense you and I both speak a great deal to young people I through Prager you and you through of course the daily wire and all of your and your podcasts and all of the things you do I I have a big following you have a big following I don't think they're thinking gee this Prager who talks about morality he doesn't have that much credibility with me cuz he supports the president because people understand why I do when I try to make it clear why I do so your worry is not my worry but but we need you and I'm it's not you're the last person I would patronize of the six billion people on earth assembly so I'm not patronizing you we need you terribly remember though that there are people on our side who don't there is one I don't want to say his name because I know him pretty well oh and it'll be obvious if anybody wants to research it but but most people won't who said who said that who's a lifelong Republican and said Trump is Trump is worse than Stalin I mean I mean okay it is at idiotic and and and and it's and it's very destructive and there are those who you know they they've left the party George will I adore George will he's done preview university videos and and he's left the Republican Party these this is overwrought reaction the world is dirty and and I we had a Donald Trump with with tremendous style and and all the wonderful things you would like but we have him it's sort of like a marriage he's a package Trump is a package this package saved this country from the left taking it over in the last election that is so big that I somehow never lose picture of that it with his the sins that he commits that's my position your position is for our credibility let's point out each of the sins that he commits fine we need you and we need me and I mean this quite sincerely and you're yours is as as morality based as - morality based but my my I am so focused on the near death of America that took place in 2016 and I believe that I believe had Hillary Clinton or any Democrat I don't get a job I mean it's irrelevant had any Democrat won then I had no reason to have faith that this country will not go the way of Western Europe well it's it's always great to have you here and I want to I want to part with with one question for you dennis prager author of the rational Bibles so if you are going to pick your favorite section of of the Torah well what is your what is your favorite section of the torus this is just a fun and a parting question you that that's it's like what's you know what's my favorite part about my wife that's how much I love the Torah and I'm sorry that dangerous here yeah no I understand I'm crazy about the Ten Commandments I I am and I spend a vast amount of time in this the book that's out the first one on Exodus explaining why they alone they alone in fact do not steal alone would make a good world and IIIi would I guess I would that's why I began with Exodus because I'm in love with the Ten Commandments and and they're so including honor your father and mother which changed my life and I am I hope my kids follow it - okay well Dennis it's great to have you here and obviously Dennis Internet your volume comes out next year his his book on Genesis comes out next year can't wait for the rest of them to unfold Dennis thanks so much for stopping by eventually row shows Sunday
