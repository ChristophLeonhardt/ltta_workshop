the good news is we finally know what brand new cabinet minister bill Blair is supposed to be doing with this time now the bad news is that his job is to find new and exciting ways to grab your guns after nearly two months on the job in a ministry created just for him Bill Blair the minister of border security and organized crime reduction has finally received his job description and a mandate letter from the prime minister now according to his mandate letter Bill Blair is supposed to lead the government's plan on irregular migration now Trudeau never says exactly what the plan is or even if the intent has to stop all this illegal border crossing bell blares also supposed to be be conversations with the United States on the safe third-country agreement again no mention is actually closing the loophole that is permitting thousands and thousands of people to stream illegally across our border and then claim asylum from the United States but today I'm actually going to talk to you about Bill Blair's new role in implementing the liberals gun control agenda now this is again directly from Bill Blair's mandate letter Bill Blair is supposed to support the Ministry of Public Safety and emergency preparedness on the passage of Bill c71 and work together on additional policy regulations or legislation that could reduce crime involving the use of firearms and keep Canadians safe bill Blair should lead an examination of a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada while not impeding the lawful use of firearms by Canadians weird last sentence there but there you have it we've heard all the musings we've all made our assumptions based on the public safety ministry's ongoing support of Toronto Mayor John Tory's pursuit of a full gun ban in his city and we clearly assumed right the Liberals are looking at ways to strip lawful Canadians of their legally owned firearms firearms those Canadians have ever committed any crime with own firearms those Canadians have followed all the rules to own and Firearms those Canadians paid a heck of a lot of money for now according to Justin Trudeau the Liberals are not going to impede the use of your firearms they're just gonna come along and snatch them away from you so I don't know get your head around that liberal doublespeak if you can now did you notice the Liberals never ever define what an assault weapon is so you can pretty well put your money on the fact that they mean most or if not all semi-automatic firearms now let's talk about Bill Blair for a second he was the police chief in Toronto as Toronto started to take a turn from Toronto the good to Toronto the violent Bill Blair didn't have the solutions to stop gun violence in Toronto then so why would he have the answers to stop gun violence in Toronto now as Police Chief Bill Blair in conjunction with Mayor John Tory ended the police policy of carding cutting off of valuable Intel tool for police to combat gang violence and then gang violence predictably exploded in Toronto and yet somehow insanely bell blares the minister at the federal level responsible for stopping gang violence yeah good luck with that now the Liberals are telling us that this thing is just going to be a study to see if grabbing our guns is somehow doable but does anybody really think that this study is going to go any other way but in favor of a ban when we know anybody from the firearms rights side of this whole argument has been completely written out of the consultation and discussions process with regard to gun control in this country the vice president of Ottawa's own firearms Advisory Committee Natalie Prevost is a longtime gun control activist not unbiased or without her very own gun control agenda now she's been accused of writing the bulk of the Liberals latest gun law c71 the Liberals have been listening to gun control activists instead of gun experts or even crime experts for that matter three of Canada's top cops have come out against the Liberals latest foray into gun control because they say it's a complete and total waste of police resources to focus on the law-abiding when the problem is organized crime in major urban metropolitan areas a radio station in Swan River Manitoba has taken to defending themselves against the violent attacks but they've gone so far as to call domestic terrorism against them on their Facebook page this station said this as many residents of Swan River are aware last week CJ radio received an anonymous threat and the threat was indicated that we had one week to cease operations in Swan River or our business would be burned to the ground coupled with a rash of recent break-ins breakin attempts and damage to our building we have no choice but to consider the threat credible to be clear we consider any threats of a similar nature to be domestic terrorism whether it is directed at our company another company or an individual no one in Canada should face such threats now the station says they started doing their own unarmed patrols at the building and they said that Swan River RCMP are simply not able to provide a level of protection that is consistent with unarmed patrols being able to receive assistance when they need it the station said they are unwilling to place the safety of their unarmed staff at the level of risk currently being presented by the lack of police presence in Swan River the police aren't helping them so the station staff are looking out for themselves now they have made the decision that any of the station's patrols or overnight occupancy efforts will include at least one member who is licensed to carry firearms in Canada the station said not to worry they're going to follow all the laws but they are protecting themselves against this so-called domestic terrorism because the police simply cannot the station said that they have instructed their staff to use lethal means of ending any threat against the lives of their employees this is the reality outside of the Toronto Ottawa Montreal bubble our minutes away when seconds count the Liberals want to render those people in rural Manitoba rural Canada actually helpless and unable to defend themselves against criminals because Bill Blair and John Tory set the stage for the violent wave of crime that is unfolding now somewhere thousands of kilometers away in Toronto for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun Reid big tech loves to censor conservatives but we have a way around that we have our own rebel media mobile app it's available on the Google Play
