1
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:08,407
>> Tucker: BRETT KAVANAUGH SWORN

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,609
IN, ENSKONSED IN THE SUPREME

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:10,909
COURT.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,743
THE LEFT ANGER IS NOT CLOSE TO

5
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:13,579
ENDING.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,981
PRETTY SOON IT WILL BE SO BAD WE

7
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,051
WILL NEED A NEW COMMITTEE TO

8
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,053
INVESTIGATE IT.

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,622
TODAY ON "THE VIEW" SOME ONE

10
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,656
IDENTIFIED AS A LEGAL ANALYST

11
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,458
SAID WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL

12
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,259
ASSAULT, DUE PROCESS PLAYS NO

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:27,626
ROLE.

14
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,028
WATCH THIS.

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,263
>> AFTER 40 YEARS WE FINALLY

16
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,764
CHANGED THE LAW.

17
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:34,833
WE FINALLY SAID A WOMAN'S WORD

18
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,401
IS FLUFF.

19
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,670
I'VE TAKEN MANY CASES TO TRIAL

20
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,906
WITH JUST A WOMAN'S KWORD.

21
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,241
-- WORD.

22
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,242
>> EVERY SINGLE WOMAN NEEDS TO

23
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,476
BE HEARD.

24
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,177
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WOMEN ARE

25
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,778
CORRECT.

26
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:49,481
BUT, SONNY, YOU ARE INSINUATING

27
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,949
THAT EVIDENCE DOESN'T MATTER.

28
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,017
AS A LAWYER, EVIDENCE SHOULD

29
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,785
ALWAYS MATTER.

30
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,321
>> IT IS EVIDENCE, TESTIMONY.

31
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,022
YOU DON'T NEED CORROBORATING

32
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:57,856
EVIDENCE.

33
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,591
YOU DON'T NEED A RAPE KIT.

34
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,893
YOU DON'T NEED WITH ITS BECAUSE

35
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:02,894
OFTENTIMES THERE'S NO WITH ITS

36
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,097
DURING RAPE.

37
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,433
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

38
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:11,270
EVIDENCE, TESTIMONIAL EVIDENC

39
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,639
EVIDENCE --

40
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,173
>> Tucker: ALLEN DERSHOWITZ

41
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:16,642
SPENT DECADES TEACHING AT

42
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,809
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, HE KNOWS

43
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,778
ABOUT DUE PROCESS, AUTHOR OF THE

44
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,213
BOOK "THE CASE AGAINST

45
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:21,947
IMPEACHING TRUMP" AND JOINS US

46
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:22,547
TONIGHT.

47
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:23,649
THANKS FOR COMING ON, PROFESSOR.

48
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,584
>> THANK YOU.

49
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,551
>> Tucker: YOU HEARD SPECIFIC

50
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:28,754
LEGAL CLAIM THAT IT IS NOW THE

51
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,855
LAW IN THE UNITED STATES THAT,

52
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,223
AND I'M QUOTING, A WOMAN'S WORD

53
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:31,590
IS ENOUGH.

54
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,692
THAT'S IT.

55
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,593
IS THAT TRUE?

56
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,229
>> TECHNICALLY IT IS TRUE, THE

57
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,597
LAW WAS CHANGED SOME YEARS AGO,

58
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,199
AND I THINK IT WAS A GOOD

59
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,335
CHANGE, THAT YOU DON'T NEED

60
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,670
CORROBORATION TO MAKE A CASE.

61
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,072
SO THAT IF A WOMAN, WHO WAS

62
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,175
RAPED, IMMEDIATELY GOES TO THE

63
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,177
HOSPITAL, GETS A RAPE KIT,

64
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:57,015
IDENTIFIES HER ASSAILANT, KNEW

65
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,116
HER ASSAIL AREN'T, HER WORD

66
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,885
WOULD BE ENOUGH.

67
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,254
IF IT'S 35 YEARS OLD, THE MAIN

68
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,056
WITH IT SAID NO SHE WASN'T

69
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,457
THERE, IF THERE ARE

70
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,193
INCONSISTENCIES IN THE STORY,

71
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:10,061
OBVIOUSLY, THE TESTIMONY OF THE

72
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,296
WOMAN, THOUGH TECHNICALLY

73
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,998
SUFFICIENT, WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH

74
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,400
TO CONVINCE ANY REASONABLE FACT

75
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,068
FINDER BEYOND A REASONABLE

76
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,069
DOUBT.

77
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,105
THINK OF THE CASE TODAY, HARVEY

78
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,773
WEINSTEIN, I CONSULTED BRIEFLY

79
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,475
ON ONE OF THE E-MAIL ISSUES IN

80
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,312
THAT CASE, HAD THE MAIN

81
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,648
ACCUSERS, ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM

82
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,115
DISMISSED TODAY.

83
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,216
EVIDENCE CAME OUT THAT A

84
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,517
DETECTIVE SUPPRESSED THAT THE

85
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:35,354
MAIN ACCUSER TOLD A FRIEND THAT

86
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,589
SHE HAD WILLINGLY AND

87
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,394
VOLUNTARILY ENGAGED IN ORAL SEG

88
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,230
WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN TO BE CAST

89
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,533
IN A ROLE, HAVING PRESUMABLY

90
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,634
TESTIFIED UNDER OATH THAT HE

91
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:50,736
FORCED HER TO HAVE SEX.

92
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,304
WOMEN WOULD DIE.

93
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,239
THEY LIE FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.

94
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,808
I AGREE THAT MOST WOMEN TELL THE

95
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,709
TRUTH BUT MOST ISN'T ENOUGH TO

96
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,644
CONVICT SOMEBODY.

97
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,278
YOU NEED PROOF BEYOND A

98
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,481
REASONABLE DOUBT.

99
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,316
SECRETARY IN THIS CASELY SONNY

100
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,317
IS A GOOD LAWYER, SHE IS

101
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,451
CORRECT.

102
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,453
BUT IF YOU HAVE ELEMENTS THAT

103
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,355
CAST DOUBT ON THE WORD OF THE

104
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,290
WOMAN, THEN CORROBORATION

105
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,024
CERTAINLY HELPS STRENGTHEN THE

106
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:13,859
CASE.

107
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,193
>> Tucker: SO YOU'RE ALLOWED TO

108
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,461
DOUBT A WOMANED WORD, THAT'S

109
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,496
STILL LEGAL.

110
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,965
IS THIS A SEX-SELECTIVE

111
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:20,332
QUESTION?

112
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,401
IS IT DO WE BELIEVE WOMEN MORE

113
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,301
THAN WE BELIEVE MEN?

114
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:25,470
>> FIRST OF ALL NOT ONLY ARE YOU

115
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,205
ALLOWED, BUT IF YOU'RE ON A JURY

116
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,075
YOU ARE OBLIGED TO PRESUME THE

117
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,144
INNOCENCE OF THE DEFENDANT WHICH

118
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,979
MEANS YOU CANNOT PRESUME THAT

119
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,646
THE WITNESS IS TELLING THE

120
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,347
TRUTH.

121
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,982
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY

122
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,583
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

123
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:41,453
LOOK, WE KNOW, WE'VE SEEN CASE

124
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,255
AFTER CASE WHERE WOMEN HAVE TOLD

125
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,223
THE TRUTH, AND HAVE BEEN

126
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,325
ASSAULTED, AND MEN HAVE GOTTEN

127
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:47,959
AWAY WITH IT.

128
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,461
BUT WE HAVE SEEN CASE AFTER CASE

129
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,696
WHERE WOMEN FOR THEIR OWN

130
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:54,900
REASONS LIED, THE VIRGINIA CASE,

131
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,001
THE CASE -- OTHER CASES.

132
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,736
CASE AFTER CASE.

133
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,838
AND SO, WE DON'T START WITH THE

134
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,073
PRESUMPTION THAT THERE'S A

135
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,376
GENETICALLY LINKED

136
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:04,910
CHARACTERISTIC --

137
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,278
>> Tucker: OH, GOOD, WE WERE

138
00:04:06,279 --> 00:00:00,000
GETTING PRETTY -- YOU WERE
