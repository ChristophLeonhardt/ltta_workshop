1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
The 1932 Olympics was the first time
figure skating was set to music. It was

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,620
live music. The skaters didn't get to
choose the songs, the orchestra just

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,590
played the same one over and over. Fast
forward to today, music is very much the

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,520
heart of figure skating and custom-made
for each performance. Oh, but

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,340
It wouldn't be a
figure skating competition if there was

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,700
no Swan Lake, if there was no Don Quixote,
if there was no Carmen.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,759
This is Adam Rippon.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,760
He's the 2016 national champion and
2018 Olympian.

9
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,190
he has ever competed in,
he says there was at least one skate set

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,100
to Carmen.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,320
I mean we love our Carmen what
can I say?

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,430
And he's right. There was the

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,699
infamous battle of the Carmens in the
1988 Olympics.

14
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,780
German skater Katarina Witt and an
American skater Debi Thomas both

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,620
performed their long program to Carmen.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,560
It's time to compare Carmens.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,539
I've skated

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,600
to Carmen so I mean like I'm guilty of
my own charge.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,920
So, what makes Carmen

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,700
Carmen is an
opera written by a french composer

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,159
Georges Bizet about a gypsy girl named
Carmen. So it's not just one song called

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,880
Carmen, it's actually dozens of songs and
the most recognizable is probably...

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,080
But you probably have heard of this one...

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,120
this one...

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,340
and this one.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,220
You get the point.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,900
This is...

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,400
Carmen is often sassy and flirty and as
you can see, lots of skaters take

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,560
advantage of that.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,260
But her story ends
tragically when she's stabbed to death by

31
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,880
her rejected lover.

32
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,299
With Carmen, Hugo and other music designers
can explore a full range of emotions.

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,900
This structure allows skaters to start strong
with jumps, grabbing people's attention.

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,410
In the slower section, skaters can
show more of a vulnerable side and also

35
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,500
save energy for the big finale

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,180
For my short program I wanted to do
something that was a really upbeat that

37
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,940
would get the crowd like on their feet,
everybody clapping.

38
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,400
And then in the free skate I wanted to
show like a softer side, I wanted to show

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,380
off my lyrical skating style.

40
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,980
That's why operas are so popular
in figure skating. It's divided into

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,480
acts with a clear story line.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,720
We're
gluttons for punishment,

43
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,390
because you know we'll roll our eyes at
somebody skating to Carmen and then on

44
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,569
the complete flipside of that, every year
we'll go to our choreographer and we'll

45
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,000
be like what do you think of this? It's Carmen.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
But this long era of Carmen might

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,580
be coming to an end.

48
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,569
In 2014 the International Skating Union

49
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:10,720
changed the music rules to allow skaters
to skate to music with lyrics. It was an

50
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,700
attempt to appeal to a younger audience,
so skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in

51
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,740
Bizet for...

52
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,719
Lil' John.

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
When we were given
the option to skate to music with lyrics,

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,380
it opened it up to any piece of music
you could ever want to skate to.

55
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,280
Now with

56
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,620
more freedom and access to all kinds of
music, they're looking for their new Carmen.

57
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,120
Will it be Lil' Jon? You never
know.

58
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,440
I found throughout my whole entire
career that if you see somebody doing

59
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,480
something that they really love to do,

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,580
that really translates so much, that even

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,289
if you're not a big fan of the music you
just enjoy that person enjoying what

62
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:53,900
they're doing.

63
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,160
And maybe this rule change
will spur a new era in skating, like 1932 Olympics

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,840
when the sport was still new.

65
00:05:01,420 --> 00:00:00,000
And the official report quotes,
