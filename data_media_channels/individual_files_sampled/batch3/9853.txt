GAS PRICES ARE UP, YOU PROBABLY NOTICED THAT BEFORE I DID AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING INTO THE SUMMER. REGULAR GALLON OF GAS IS UP 6 CENTS FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE COST OF FUEL IS ALREADY WIPING OUT A BIG CHUNK OF THE BENEFIT AMERICANS RECEIVED FROM GOP TAX CUT AND THINGS COULD GET WORSE AS SUMMER APPROACHES FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION'S STANDOFF WITH IRAN OIL-PRODUCING NATIONS TO TIGHT SUPPLIES, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, HE WORKED ON THREE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND MICHAEL STAR HOPKINS-DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS AND HUFFINGTON POST CONTRIBUTOR. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. FOR REPUBLICANS, DOES THIS PUT THEM ON DEFENSE IN MIDTERMS, WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE TAX CUTS ARE GOING TO BE A GREAT BOOM TO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN NOVEMBER, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, IF AMERICANS SPEND SUMMER GOING TO BEACH OR PICNIC AND GAS PRICES ARE HIGH, THAT SEEMS LIKE A POLITICAL PROP? NOT ONLY THE SUMMER, BUT THINK ABOUT THE UPCOMING FALL AND WINTER, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. EVERY ECONOMIST FOR THE MOST PART ACROSS THE BOARD DOES ALL THE STUDIES INDICATE THAT CONSUMER SPENDING IS UP AND WITH THAT MEANS IS THAT THE TAX BREAK IS WORKING AND MORE MONEY IN THEIR ACCOUNTS, 401(K), INVESTMENTS A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT THEY DID YEARS AGO, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE INCREASE IN GAS PRICES, IF YOU'RE A FAMILY OF 4 AND WANT TO TAKE A VACATION, YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACT INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE BOARD AND I DO THINK REPUBLICANS DO HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT IN MIDTERMS IF OUR SOUL GOVERNMENT IS GIVING SOMETHING AND ARTICULATE THE MESSAGE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RISING PRICES OF GAS. SO, MICHAEL, THERE'S SOME HONEST TALK THERE, SOME STRAIGHT TALK THERE FROM YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE ABOUT HOW THERE COULD BE CHALLENGES FOR THEM, ON THE OTHER HAND, I'M LOOKING AT NEW YORK TIMES HEADLINE TODAY THAT SAYS AMONG OTHER THINGS DEMOCRATS WILL AVOID DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA HOUSE, 3 OR 4 HOUSE SEAT IT IS DEMOCRATS THOUGHT WERE GOING TO BE SLAM DUNKS FOR THEM AND MAYBE REPUBLICANS WILL HOLD ONTO SEATS AND MAYBE BLUE WAVE IS NOT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE TO RECAPTURE THE HOUSE BUT I THINK DEMOCRATS DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MESSAGING. THE TAX BILL HAS BEEN POPULAR BUT ALSO WE HAVE SEEN LOWER MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE NOT RECEIVE SOME OF THE BENEFITS THEY EXPECTED, IT'S PRODUCED A MIXED MESSAGE FOR DEMOCRATS, ON ONE END, THERE'S CRITIQUES THAT NEED TO BE MADE ON THE TAX BILL BUT ON THE OTHER PART, WHEN YOU LOOK AT SPEAKER PELOSI AND COMMENTS ABOUT CRUMBS, THEY HAVE BEEN HURTFUL FOR DEMOCRATS, A MEASURED APPROACH IS NEEDED. REAL QUICK. I WAS GOING TO SAY REALLY QUICKLY, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE, FOR MOST PART THEIR ENTIRE MESSAGE HAS BEEN REPLACE DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, GET RID OF HIM, HE'S DOING A HORRIBLE JOB. LOOK, AMERICANS MAY DISAGREE WITH ASPECTS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, I DISAGREE WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS BUT IF YOU YOU LOOK AT POLICY, WE ARE SEEING SUCCESS, POLICY, WHETHER THAT'S DOMESTICALLY, YOU START TALKING ABOUT WELFARE ISSUES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS MENTIONED, WE WILL DO WELFARE REFORM, YOU TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT CERTAINLY THINGS AS WELL, THERE'S SUCCESS THAT YOU CAN CLEARLY POINT TO. YOU THE POSSIBILITY, THE DEMOCRATS WERE LAUGHING AT PRESIDENT AND NOW MAYBE PEACE TALKS AFTER ALL. YOU HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT, HISTORIC LOWS NOT JUST ACROSS THE BOARD FOR HISPANICS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS, WHAT PART OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY DOES NOT LIKE? IT'S NOT THE ISSUE ABOUT NOT LIKING PEACE AND PROSPERITY, WHAT WE WANT IS EQUALITY FOR ALL I THINK IF DEMOCRATS CAN CONTINUE TO PUSH A MESSAGE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT 2018. MICHAEL, I AGREE WITH ECONOMIC SUCCESS FOR ALL. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN LET'S LOOK AT THIS LOCALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AS CROSS THE COUNTRY PARTICULAR THOSE HEAVILY MINORITY, YOU LOOK AT THE LACK OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY, YOU LOOK AT TECHS AND OPPORTUNITY, LOOK AT THE ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DEMOCRATS BEING AS PART AND WANT SUCCESS IN MOBILITY AND PEOPLE, I HAVE TO PUSH BACK BECAUSE ALL INDICATORS DON'T SHOW THAT'S THE CASE. MICHAEL, I WILL LET YOU MAKE THE LAST POINT. WALL STREET JOURNAL HAS THE THING TODAY THAT BASICALLY TALKS ABOUT TAX REVENUE SOARING IN SOME DEMOCRATIC STATES LIKE NEW YORK, CONNECTICUT, CALIFORNIA. UNEXPECTEDLY BLUE STATES BECAUSE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID, THERE WERE SOME TAXES GOING UP IN THOSE STATES AND REVENUES GOING UP BUT ALSO BECAUSE CORPORATE PROFITS ARE SOARING RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE HEARD DEMOCRATS SAY, THEY ARE GOING TO PUT IT IN POCKET, THEY ARE HELPING JERRY BROWN IN CALIFORNIA. HE'S HELPING DEAL WITH BUDGET DEFICITS BECAUSE CORPORATIONS ARE PAYING MORE IN TAXES IN SOME OF THE STATES BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS SO GOOD. WELL, I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT POINT. I'D SAY IF YOU IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN INVEST IN THE STOCK MARKET, YOU CAN BUY REAL ESTATE, THEN YOU ARE IN A GOOD POSITION, THAT'S NOT A LOT OF AMERICANS, AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS BASICALLY A CORPORATE BAIL-OUT IF YOU'RE BIG PHARMA, IF YOU'RE BIG OIL, IF YOU'RE IN BANKING, THOSE INDUSTRIES HAVE SEEN WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT BONUSES REALLY HELP, A LOT OF AVERAGE WORKERS HAVE GOTTEN BONUSES. THEY HAVE SEEN COSTS GO UP, HEALTH CARE, GAS GO UP. THAT'S BECAUSE OF DEMOCRATS. THAT'S NOT A FAIR ARGUMENT. YOU HAVE EVERY CHAMBER RIGHT
