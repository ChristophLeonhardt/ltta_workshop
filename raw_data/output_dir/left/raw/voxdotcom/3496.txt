1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
This is the Guimaras oil spill of 2006 and
it's the worst of its kind in the

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,500
Philippine's history.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,080
More than 130
thousand gallons of bunker oil gushed

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,380
into the Panay Gulf.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,320
In an attempt to contain the spill locals turn to an

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,670
unconventional method: these
freaky-looking sausage things are all

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,760
filled with synthetic materials
fabricated in a lab.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,859
It's also organic

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,100
stuff you can find on most continents
and probably in your shower drain.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,200
It's human hair.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,480
After the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska Phil McCroy, a hair

12
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,800
stylist in Alabama, had a novel idea for
the cleanup effort.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,860
On TV he noticed how a

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,629
sea otter's fur had become saturated with
oil and thought if that's what oil would

15
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,379
do to an otter's fur, then the same must
be true for human hair.

16
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,739
He took scraps of hair trimmings from
work, stuffed them into his wife's

17
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,290
pantyhose and tested his new invention
in a small spill he created at his house.

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,120
NASA's studied and confirmed Phil's
invention worked.

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,000
I called every hair

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,780
stylist in Alabama 'til I found him.

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,630
He said that his garage was full of hair

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,360
being donated from salons all over the
place, but he'd never been able to make a

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,500
business out of it and so from like
about 2000, 2001 we were partners.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,000
They teamed up on the Clean Wave program. It
collects donated hair, fur, feathers, and

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
other fibers to make recycled felted
mats and hair booms that can mop up oil spills.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,820
Turns out hair is pretty good at

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,823
cleaning up oil.

28
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,644
It repels water and can
collect contaminants.

29
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:37,710
Water goes into a

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,200
sponge and it blows up and that's called
absorbent but oil coats hair on the

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,580
outside so like it's called adsorbent.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,149
Hair is also natural, cheap, and renewable

33
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,400
which makes it an ideal material for
cleaning up oil spills.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,000
Making a hair

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,540
boom is pretty straightforward.

36
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,380
All you need is human hair and pantyhose.

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,990
Take the hair, stuff it into the hose, and
voilÃ .

38
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,130
After getting over the freaky feeling of
handling someone else's clumped up hair,

39
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,540
place it into contaminated water and
watch the hair boom do its thing.

40
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,480
There's little diesel spills all the
time, so like every little harbor can use

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,780
that stuff. You know, it was a great way
to just kind of string from dock to dock

42
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,080
and kind of protect your private beaches.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,420
But hair booms and hair mats haven't

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,320
been the principal method to clean major
oil spills.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
They weren't used extensively

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,720
in the aftermath of the Deepwater
Horizon spill, where over the course of

47
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,040
87 days 134 million gallons of oil
gushed into the Gulf of Mexico.

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,300
Instead, crews used 1.8 million gallons of
chemical dispersants, oil skimmers, fire,

49
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,260
and booms and barriers made of synthetic
material to clean up the mess.

50
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,720
With oil spills, time is of the essence.

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,540
The longer oil is in the ocean the

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,180
harder it is to retrieve.

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,980
The immediate
ecological impact of oil spills is

54
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,610
obvious. It kills marine wildlife and
destroys habitats and breeding grounds.

55
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,420
The chemicals used to clean up oil
spills also pose a danger to human

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,100
health.

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,550
As of now, hair booms and hair
mats are not the primary tools used to

58
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,360
contain oil spills, but possibly one day
they could be.

59
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,420
It was very interesting

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,700
for us to see the public desire to help.

61
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,000
There's so many hair salons

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,620
in every city and billions more people
with hair to spare.

63
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,940
So it's not out of

64
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,570
the realm of possibilities that help for
the next oil spill

65
00:03:39,570 --> 00:00:00,000
maybe just one snip away.
