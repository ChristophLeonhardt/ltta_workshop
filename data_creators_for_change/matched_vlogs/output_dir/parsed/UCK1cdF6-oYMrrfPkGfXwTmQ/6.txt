What's up guys, Violet here back at it again
So you might be wondering
Why are you in your old house
Well I'll tell ya
As you guys know I've been working on a sunglass collaboration with Quay Australia
and I'm so excited to finally share with you guys
all my new styles, all my colors of all my sunglasses
it officially dropped today
so if you didn't buy them already please go buy some
I'm not gonna like force you to
but if you want to it's up to you
oooooo
I'm just going to show you guys all my new styles
and yeah lets just get right into it
so these ones are called clout
obviously I named them after me and my friends just kidding
and clout hits home hard for me because just you know
Clout Gang and they go with everything
I think these ones are my favorite ones just because
I wear them with everything and their just simple
tiny round sunglasses
And their really easy
So these ones are called finesse and just like the clout
we have the black, red, and violet
These ones I named finesse just because
I feel like I'm a finesser
I finesse my way through life and now I'm here
and I feel like everyones like a little bit of a finesser
in their life
You can relate
The violet ones, I couldn't just name them purple
because that's not I'm Alissa Violet
obviously I have to name them violet duh
These ones are just cool edgy their just their a finesse
You can put them up here
you can put them down here
You could do whatever
These ones are called BO$$ with money signs
Because
As you can see I have a tattoo thats says boss with money signs
So obviously I had to incorporate this in my sunglass collection
Because I'm a boss
with money signs
I love how these have the little gold on the sides
cause it goes with all my jewelry and
Im just wearing a lot of gold now a days
So these ones are called hindsight
and I think their my other favorites just because
their so big and they block out the haters
I like to wear these when I go to the airport when I go to the mall
These are almost like an everyday sunglasses for me too
they just they look so
unbothered and leave me alone I'm too good
Their just like their dope sunglass
ses
uh
Their big and blocky and they remind me of like
lady gaga, like pop star vibe, like a diva
Which is me
and then we have them in gold and then black and pink
and their just... amazing
