1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,080
Imagine our world expanding to a base on the moon.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,360
Or an internet that comes from space.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,180
It all might come Sooner Than You Think.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,980
The biggest thing keeping humans from invading space is the cost of rockets.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,360
Historically, getting to orbit has been pricey.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,940
Somewhere between 100 million and 300 million dollars a pop.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,360
And that’s kept the pace of launches stuck at only around 100 per year.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,500
But if you look not so far into the future, there are signs that number will go up. Way up.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,740
SpaceX proved that private companies can get to space on the cheap. And also come back home.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,140
They’ve brought the cost of launch down from hundreds of millions to tens of millions.

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,780
In the process, they’ve ignited a 21st century rocket revolution.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,840
And now about ten startups are chasing them to space.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,540
The leader is Rocket Lab, a company that launched for the first time this May from the coast of New Zealand

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,940
with a rocket forged from carbon fiber and powered by 3D-printed engines.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,940
They hope to fill their small rockets with tiny satellites

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,080
and charge customers around $5 million for on demand access to space.

17
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,920
They plan to start launching rockets once a week and then every day.

18
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,560
But there’s just one problem with all this: economics.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,000
Someone’s going to have to buy rides on all those rockets.

20
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,600
That demand for space rides will come in the form of nanosatellites, the tiny offspring of traditional satellites.

21
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,600
Companies like Google, SpaceX, Samsung and others

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,560
have big plans to send thousands of these cubes into space to beam internet back to the entire planet.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,360
These small spaceships would form massive constellations

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,300
that encircle the globe with at least three times more satellites

25
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,360
than humanity has launched in its entire history

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,000
And it will take a lot of rockets to get them there.

27
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,420
There’s also buzz of a private moon base that would cost around $5 billion.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,500
That’s a hefty sum.

29
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,320
But if you happen to be the richest man in the world and own a rocket company,

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,780
it probably won’t bankrupt you.

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,960
And getting all that stuff to the moon? Then we're talking even more rockets.

32
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,900
Right now, the supply and demand of space are stuck in a bit of a stalemate,

33
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,520
a staring contest to see which will move first.

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,080
But the cost of launch is dropping, and fast.

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
When the demand curve and supply curve meet,

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,700
100 launches a year will become 365,

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,140
a launch every day, and maybe more.

38
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,760
That’s when we’ll become a truly space-faring species.

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:00:00,000
And it may happen sooner than you think.
