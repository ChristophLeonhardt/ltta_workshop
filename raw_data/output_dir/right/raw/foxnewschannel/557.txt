00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:03,553
FUTURE JUSTICE.

2
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:04,254
>> Harris: GOING TO HAVE TO

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,555
CUT IN WITH BREAKING NEWS.

4
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,090
WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT AT THE

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,292
U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY TODAY IS

6
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:10,093
MET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

7
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,828
COLUMBIA AND WAS ASKED SOME

8
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:12,595
QUESTIONS ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

9
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,265
LET'S WATCH TOGETHER.

10
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,466
>> President Trump: TRY TO

11
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:17,667
MAKE THEM INTO SOMETHING, LET'S

12
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,702
BE NICE ABOUT IT, THAT HE'S NOT.

13
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:22,772
HE HAS A HIGH-QUALITY PERSON, A

14
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,307
GREAT INTELLECT, YOU'RE ALSO NOT

15
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:25,709
SEEING HIM ON HIS FOOTING.

16
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:26,576
THIS ISN'T HIS FOOTING.

17
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,878
HE HAS NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

18
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:30,980
HE'S NEVER HAD ANY CHARGES LIKE

19
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,716
THIS.

20
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:34,551
CHARGES COME UP FROM 36 YEARS

21
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,352
AGO THAT ARE TOTALLY

22
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,422
UNSUBSTANTIATED?

23
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:40,824
YOU WATCHING THIS IS THE

24
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:44,661
PRESIDENT OF A GREAT COUNTRY,

25
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,863
YOU MUST THINK HOW IS THIS

26
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:47,864
POSSIBLE?

27
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,299
76 YEARS AGO, NOBODY EVER KNEW

28
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,333
ABOUT IT OR HEARD ABOUT IT AND

29
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,369
NOW A NEW CHARGE COMES UP AND

30
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:54,137
SHE SAID IT MIGHT NOT BE HIM AND

31
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,840
THERE WERE GAPS AND SAID SHE WAS

32
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,944
TOTALLY INEBRIATED, ALL MESSED

33
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:01,211
UP.

34
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,646
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IF IT WAS HIM,

35
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,882
BUT IT MIGHT'VE BEEN HIM.

36
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:06,683
DOES NOT MAKE HIM A

37
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:08,618
SUPREME COURT JUDGE BECAUSE OF

38
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:09,085
THAT.

39
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,720
THIS IS A CON GAME BEING PLAYED

40
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,589
BY THE DEMOCRATS ALSO.

41
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,158
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAWYERS.

42
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,092
THESE LAWYERS ARE THE SAME

43
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:18,028
LAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING

44
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:19,396
FOR YEARS.

45
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:19,930
THEY KEEP FIGHTING.

46
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,431
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAWYERS.

47
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,333
AND IT'S A SHAME THAT YOU CAN DO

48
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,668
THIS TO A PERSON'S LIFE.

49
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,504
I'LL TELL YOU, MAYBE EVEN MORE

50
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,238
IMPORTANT, WHO IS GOING TO WANT

51
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:31,474
TO GO BEFORE THE SYSTEM TO BE A

52
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,043
SUPREME COURT JUDGE WERE TO BE A

53
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:35,045
JUDGE WERE TO BE EVEN A

54
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:35,946
POLITICIAN?

55
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:38,949
I CAN TELL YOU THAT FALSE

56
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:41,852
ACCUSATION AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS

57
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,389
OF ALL TYPES ARE MADE AGAINST A

58
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:47,491
LOT OF PEOPLE.

59
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,225
THIS IS A HIGH-QUALITY PERSON

60
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:52,062
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE -- IT WOULD

61
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:55,866
BE A HORRIBLE INSULT TO OUR

62
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,199
COUNTRY.

63
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:01,071
IT WILL BE A HORRIBLE THING FOR

64
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,072
FUTURE POLITICAL PEOPLE AND

65
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:02,939
JUDGES, ANYTHING YOU WANT, IT

66
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,675
WOULD BE A HORRIBLE THING.

67
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:08,478
IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN.

68
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,580
THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING A CON

69
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,251
GAME.

70
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:16,453
THEY KNOW IT'S A CON GAME.

71
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:17,554
DID THEY KNOW HE'S HIGH-QUALITY.

72
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,291
AND THEY WEAKEN EACH OTHER.

73
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,059
THEY KNOW IT'S A CON GAME.

74
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,229
>> WITH A SECOND ACCUSER BE

75
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,764
ALLOWED TO TESTIFY ON THURSDAY,

76
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:28,365
WOULD YOU WELCOME THAT?

77
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,466
>> THE SECOND ACCUSER HAS

78
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,435
NOTHING.

79
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:32,769
THE SECOND ACCUSER THINKS MAYBE

80
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,471
HE COULD HAVE BEEN HIM, MAYBE

81
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:34,738
NOT.

82
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,407
SHE ADMITS SHE WAS DRUNK.

83
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,644
SHE ADMITS TIME LAPSES.

84
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:46,150
THIS IS A PERSON AND THIS IS A

85
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,985
SERIES OF STATEMENTS THAT'S

86
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:50,387
GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THE MOST

87
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,256
TALENTED GOVERNMENT OF THE

88
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,457
GREATEST INTELLECTS FROM A

89
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:56,093
JUDICIAL STANDPOINT IN OUR

90
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,795
COUNTRY GOING TO KEEP HIM OFF

91
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:58,962
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

92
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,465
I SAID SOMETHING THIS MORNING,

93
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:04,701
HE HAS A CHANCE TO BE ONE OF THE

94
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:09,840
GREATEST JUSTICES EVER IN THE

95
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,507
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

96
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:13,744
WHAT A SHAME, AND WHAT A SHAME

97
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:15,713
IT IS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER

98
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:16,714
PEOPLE WHOSE WORLD THAT DOESN'T.

99
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:19,149
THAT'S NOT HIS WORLD AND IS NOT

100
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:19,917
THEIR WORLD.

101
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:20,918
THESE ARE LEGITIMATE PEOPLE.

102
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:24,688
IF THEY'RE NOT IN THE WORLD OF

103
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:25,689
CONS IN THE WORLD OF OBSTRUCT IN

104
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,926
THE OF RESIST.

105
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,894
HE NEVER THOUGHT THIS WAS EVEN A

106
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:31,595
POSSIBILITY, HE CAN'T BELIEVE

107
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:35,332
THIS IS HAPPENING.

108
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:36,867
HIS WIFE IS DEVASTATED.

109
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:40,271
HIS CHILDREN ARE DEVASTATED.

110
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,406
I DON'T MEAN LIKE I'M A LITTLE

111
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:42,740
UNHAPPY.

112
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,342
THEY ARE DEVASTATED.

113
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,110
AND IT'S BECAUSE THESE DEMOCRATS

114
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,314
AND THEY KNOW WHEN I SEE SCHUMER

115
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,249
WHO NEVER EVEN SAW THIS WOMAN, I

116
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,686
BELIEVE HER 100% OF THESE OTHER

117
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:57,188
SENATORS THAT I DEAL WITH ON A

118
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:58,322
DAILY BASIS, I KNOW THEM BETTER

119
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,057
THAN THEY KNOW THEMSELVES.

120
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:02,927
IT IS JUST A GAME TO THEM.

121
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,695
BUT IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS GAME

122
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:05,196
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

123
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:09,500
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

124
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,301
>> Harris: THE PRESENT THEY'RE

125
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,471
GOING AS FAR TO DEFEND HIS

126
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:14,172
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE TO SAY

127
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,575
THAT THIS IS A CON GAME BY

128
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:18,075
DEMOCRATS.

129
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:20,043
AND HE EARLIER HAD SAID THAT HE

130
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,279
MIGHT BE ACCORDING TO THE

131
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,614
WHITE HOUSE OPEN TO HEARING A

132
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:24,515
SECOND ACCUSER AGAINST JUDGE

133
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,950
KAVANAUGH BUT YOU HEARD HIM

134
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,952
SAYING RIGHT THERE THAT THE

135
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:29,987
WOMAN, THE SECOND ACCUSER WAS

136
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,589
INEBRIATED ACCORDING TO HER,

137
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,491
DOESN'T REMEMBER SOME OF THE

138
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:36,027
PERTINENT DETAILS IN HER

139
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:36,661
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUDGE

140
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:37,028
KAVANAUGH.

141
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,697
HE SAYS THIS IS NOT HIS PERSONAL

142
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:40,031
FOOTING.

143
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:40,631
HE HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE

144
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,300
SITUATION BEFORE.

145
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,967
THE PRESIDENT THERE AND YOU

146
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,102
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE

147
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,603
THE WAY IT WAS FRAMED, BUT HE

148
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,472
WAS STANDING NEXT TO THE

149
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,773
PRESIDENT'S OF COLUMBIA BECAUSE

150
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:51,309
THEY WERE HAVING A MEETING OF

151
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:52,010
THESE QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS

152
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,477
CAME UP.

153
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:54,479
WE GOT A NOTE QUICKLY IN

154
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,613
BREAKING NEWS FASHION, LET'S GET

155
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:56,914
TO THIS AND THAT WE SEE WHY.

156
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:57,982
RIGHT ON POINT AS WE CONTINUE

157
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:01,119
THE CONVERSATION HERE ON OUT

158
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:01,486
NUMBERED.

159
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,888
WE DO I'LL GO BACK TO YOU,

160
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:04,422
FINISH YOUR THOUGHT.

161
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:05,123
>> Lawrence: WENT TO PICK UP

162
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,190
AT THE PRESIDENT SAID, THIS IS A

163
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,460
CON JOB BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN

164
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,727
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DEMOCRATS

165
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,262
CAN'T GO THROUGH THE LEGAL

166
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,230
PROCESS, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

167
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,267
THEY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT THE

168
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,471
COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION BECAUSE

169
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:20,372
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE.

170
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,307
WE SAW IT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF

171
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:23,475
VIRGINIA CASE WHERE THE

172
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:24,376
ROLLING STONES WROTE THIS BIG

173
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,377
ARTICLE ABOUT THIS AND ENDED UP

174
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,879
HAVING TO PAY THESE GUYS BECAUSE

175
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,214
THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH

176
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:29,914
EVIDENCE TO TAKE THIS TO COURT

177
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,717
OF LAW.

178
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:34,252
THE JUDGE KEEP SAYING THAT HE

179
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,687
WANTS FAIRNESS, HE'S NOT GOING

180
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:36,688
TO GET FAIRNESS.

181
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:39,324
THE ONLY WAY IS IN A COURT OF

182
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:39,691
LAW.

183
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:40,692
SPEAKING WITH THE PRESIDENT SAID

184
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:41,526
THERE, WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE

185
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:44,729
YOU COULD SEE ONLY BE WOMEN WHO

186
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,431
ARE NOMINATED FOR A POST AND

187
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,466
PROMOTED TO CEO AT THIS POINT

188
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,200
BECAUSE ANYBODY ELSE IT SEEMS

189
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,670
LIKE COULD BE VULNERABLE.

190
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,171
AT THE SAME TIME CAN YOU HEAR

191
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,272
FROM EXECUTIVES WHO SAY I DON'T

192
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,674
WANT TO HIRE WOMEN ANYMORE

193
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,375
BECAUSE IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR

194
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,943
ME.

195
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:58,677
THERE ARE SO MANY EXTERNALITIES

196
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,312
TO THIS.

197
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,213
>> Tomi: IT PUTS WOMEN AT A

198
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:02,113
BAD POSITION BECAUSE IT MEANS WE

199
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,481
ARE GETTING A POSITION NOT

200
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:04,382
BECAUSE OF OUR MERIT BUT BECAUSE

201
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:05,684
WE ARE THE SAFE OPTION OR IT

202
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,352
MEANS WE ARE NOT GETTING A

203
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:08,720
POSITION BECAUSE THE MALES THAT

204
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,689
WERE AROUND FEEL THAT IT'S TOO

205
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:11,389
DANGEROUS, THEY'RE AFRAID OF

206
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,258
LAWSUITS AND ALLEGATIONS.

207
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:15,060
PUTS WOMEN IN A DIFFICULT

208
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,628
POSITION AND FURTHERMORE, I LIVE

209
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,730
IN LOS ANGELES, THAT IS THE

210
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,464
BIRTHPLACE OF THIS WHOLE ME TOO

211
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,532
MOVEMENT, IT STARTED OUT IN WHAT

212
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:22,000
I BELIEVE IS A GREAT THING WHICH

213
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,336
WAS BRINGING WOMEN OUT THAT HAD

214
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:25,170
ACTUALLY BEEN ASSAULTED AND WERE

215
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,371
COMING OUT AND SAYING THIS

216
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,973
HAPPENED TO ME, WE'VE BEEN QUIET

217
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:29,274
FOR TOO LONG AND IT TURNED UGLY,

218
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:31,310
THEN IT TURNED TO THIS.

219
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,478
IT TURNED INTO I CAN MAKE SOME

220
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:34,680
POLITICALLY CONVENIENT

221
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,848
ALLEGATIONS, RUIN SOMEONE'S LIFE

222
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,482
IN SOMEONE'S FAMILY AND WE CAN

223
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,917
DO IT ALL IN THE NAME OF THE ME

224
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,285
TOO MOVEMENT BUT REALLY, IS

225
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:41,453
DEMOCRAT DRIVEN, IT'S HOLLYWOOD

226
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:43,021
DRIVEN AND I THINK THE AMERICAN

227
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:43,755
PEOPLE ARE REALLY SICK AND TIRED

228
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:44,590
OF IT.

229
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,725
>> Harris: I BET YOU WANT TO

230
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:47,793
RESPOND TO THAT.

231
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:48,727
>> Adrienne: HERE'S WHAT I

232
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,729
WANT TO SAY, IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH

233
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:51,496
TRULY BELIEVES HE'S INNOCENT AND

234
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:52,598
WE DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE WHAT

235
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:53,932
HAPPENS ON THURSDAY AND THIS IS

236
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:55,033
NOT GOING TO BE DECIDED IN FRONT

237
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:58,337
OF A JURY, IT'S GOING TO BE

238
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:59,471
DECIDED BY A PANEL OF SENATORS

239
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:00,606
AND WHO WILL LARGELY BE DRIVEN

240
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:03,775
BY THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.

241
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:05,510
EXACTLY, 36 YEARS AGO.

242
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,413
IF HE TRULY IS INNOCENT, WHY NOT

243
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:10,883
ALLOW FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION?

244
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:12,484
IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD SAY I

245
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:14,086
WANT MY NAME CLEARED, SO I WANT

246
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,754
THE FBI, I WANT THE LAW.

247
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:16,922
>> Harris: CAN I JUST HAVE

248
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,023
BEEN FOR A MINUTE?

249
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:19,725
WE HAVE NOW GOTTEN TO A PLACE

250
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,194
THAT WAS MRS. FORD AND NOW YOU

251
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:22,828
ARE SUGGESTING THAT JUDGE

252
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,196
KAVANAUGH DO IT, ARE WE IN A

253
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:27,099
PLACE WHERE AMERICAN CITIZENS

254
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,536
CAN JUST SAY FBI, GO DO THIS?

255
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:31,670
BECAUSE HE'S NOT SAYING HE

256
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,072
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THIS BUT AS

257
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:34,940
THE SENATE'S PLACE, OTHERS

258
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,141
PEOPLES PLACE TO CALL FOR AN

259
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:36,575
INVESTIGATION.

260
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,510
IS THAT THE JUDGES AND QUITE

261
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,479
FRANKLY, IT'S NOT MRS. FORD'S

262
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,280
EITHER.

263
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,981
>> Adrienne: HE IS TRYING TO

264
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:42,915
SEEK CONFIRMATION TO THE HIGHEST

265
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:44,116
COURT IN THE LAND WITH A LOT OF

266
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:44,483
STEAK IT.

267
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,319
SO HE DOES -- IF I WERE HIM, I

268
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,520
WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

269
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,390
TO SAY LET'S GET AN OUTSIDE

270
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,560
CONVENING ENTITY HERE TO TRY TO

271
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,728
DETERMINE.

272
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,129
>> Lawrence: ARE YOU GOING TO

273
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,597
CALL THE SAME THING FOR KEITH

274
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:00,466
ELLISON WHO IS THE VICE CHAIR OF

275
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:00,866
YOUR PARTY?

276
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,269
>> Adrienne: ABSOLUTELY.

277
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:03,969
I ACTUALLY THINK KEITH ELLISON

278
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:05,871
SHOULD STEP DOWN FROM THE DNC.

279
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:07,540
>> Lawrence: YOU ARE THE

280
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,107
FIRST.

281
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,508
>> Harris: IS THAT ENOUGH?

282
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:10,710
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING THAT HE

283
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,111
IS ACCUSED OF DOING, IS STEPPING

284
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,380
DOWN ENOUGH, GIVING UP A

285
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,615
PAYCHECK?

286
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,317
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE AN FBI

287
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:18,918
INVESTIGATION?

288
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:19,685
>> Adrienne: I PERSONALLY

289
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:20,553
CHOOSE TO ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT

290
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:23,322
WOMEN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE.

291
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,357
>> Tomi: AS A WOMAN HAVE, HOW

292
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:28,828
CAN YOU SAY JUST THAT WE SHOULD

293
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:29,495
BE BELIEVED.

294
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:30,630
YOU DON'T THINK THEY ARE CAPABLE

295
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,931
OF LYING AND SCHEMING, HE WORKED

296
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:33,399
FOR HILLARY CLINTON SO I GUESS

297
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:33,832
YOU KNOW THAT.

298
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,902
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD JUST TAKE

299
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:36,736
WOMEN'S WORD AS GOSPEL?

300
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,136
THAT'S INFURIATING TO ME AS A

301
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:38,971
WOMAN BECAUSE I DON'T LOOK AT

302
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,339
OTHER WOMEN AND SAY I'M JUST

303
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:41,941
GOING TO BELIEVE YOU BECAUSE WE

304
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:43,176
HAVE THE SAME BIOLOGICAL MAKING.

305
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:45,378
I THINK THAT'S WRONG.

306
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:45,978
>> Adrienne: THAT'S THE

307
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:47,080
PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW,

308
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,348
A LOT OF WOMEN WHO ARE SCARED TO

309
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:50,416
COME FORWARD, I BELIEVE THAT

310
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,417
WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THIS

311
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:56,356
CASE 36 YEARS AGO AND DR. FORD

312
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,992
FINALLY HAS THE COURAGE TO COME

313
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,326
FORWARD AND A LOT OF OTHER WOMEN

314
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:01,060
ARE FINALLY HAVING THE COURAGE

315
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:10,303
TO COME FORWARD.

316
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,271
>> Melissa: ONE AT A TIME, LET

317
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:13,306
HER FINISH.

318
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:14,541
>> Adrienne: I THINK WHEN WE

319
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,241
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS LIKE

320
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,877
THIS, WE ARE DISCOURAGING WOMEN

321
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:19,312
WHO TRULY HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF

322
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:20,079
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT

323
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,082
FROM BEING ABLE TO COME FORWARD.

324
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:24,817
>> Harris: THE WHOLE PROCESS

325
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,219
IS DISCOURAGING FOR WOMEN.

326
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:27,287
>> Melissa: THERE WAS A

327
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:28,054
DISCOURAGEMENT TO COME FORWARD,

328
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,489
BUT NOW WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE

329
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:30,924
IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE FEEL

330
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:31,625
COMFORTABLE GOING FORWARD AND

331
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,493
DIDN'T WE KIND OF SEE THIS

332
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:34,327
COMING WHEN PEOPLE STARTED

333
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:35,529
SAYING YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE

334
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,330
WOMEN NO MATTER WHAT?

335
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,999
A RED LIGHT WENT OFF AND A LOT

336
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,600
OF PEOPLE'S MINDS WHERE YOU SAID

337
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,002
WAIT A SECOND, IT DOESN'T MAKE

338
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:44,271
SENSE TO BELIEVE ANY GROUP OF

339
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:47,107
PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY.

340
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:48,108
BASED ON THE GROUP THAT THEY

341
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,309
ARE.

342
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:50,210
MAYBE LISTEN TO THEM AND YOU GO

343
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,479
LOOK INTO IT AND YOU SHOW THEM

344
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,447
RESPECT, BUT YOU DON'T

345
00:09:54,447 --> 00:10:09,296
AUTOMATICALLY DECIDE -- I THINK

346
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:09,996
SHE HAS BEEN LISTEN TO AND SHE

347
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:10,730
HAS BEEN SHOWN RESPECT AND SHE'S

348
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,431
BEEN INVITED TO COME AND TELL

349
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:11,798
HER STORY.

350
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:12,532
I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED WE'RE

351
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,200
GOING TO SEE HER ON THURSDAY

352
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,934
BECAUSE HER TEAM KEEPS CHANGING

353
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:14,334
THE DEMANDS.

354
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:15,035
AT FIRST, THEY SAID THAT THEY

355
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:15,769
WOULDN'T HAVE SENATORS INVOLVED

356
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:16,503
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE WAS GOING

357
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:17,204
TO HAVE TO AT THOSE QUESTIONS

358
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:17,871
AND NOW THEY'RE OFFENDED BY

359
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:18,171
THAT.

360
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:18,838
THEY KEEP CHANGING THE RULES

361
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:19,206
AROUND IT.

362
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:19,973
I THINK EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE

363
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,141
HEARD AND TO BE RESPECTED, BUT

364
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,310
YOU DON'T GET TO BE BELIEVED

365
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:23,743
AUTOMATICALLY.

366
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:24,778
>> Harris: I WANT TO GIVE YOU

367
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:25,545
THE LAST WORD JUST IN TERMS OF

368
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,681
WHAT WE COULD SEE LATER THIS

369
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:28,682
WEEK AND WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING

370
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:29,116
FOR.

371
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,384
>> Lawrence: I DON'T THINK

372
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:31,685
SHE'S GOING TO SHOW.

373
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:32,853
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY CRITICAL

374
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:34,488
