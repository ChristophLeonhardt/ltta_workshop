it was in the 1950s that our Secretary of State John Foster Dulles proclaimed our policy is global now we started as a continental Empire by clearing out the native peoples and other foreign forces then we became an overseas Empire by taking Highlands in various parts of the world and then after the Second World War we became a global Empire now we are playing on the whole billiard tent the United States has always had a variety of tools to use in its attacks on other countries economic sanctions are often just the beginning another thing you like to do is place some military pressure on the countries that you're talking about and there has to be an effort to demonize that country and the leader of that country particularly in our own press and in the press of that leaders own country Americans love to think that we're intervening in other countries to overthrow evil people and if that's true you have to make the person look evil in 1951 Arbenz came to power in Guatemala after being elected by the people in Washington the US president received arms with all the usual courtesies of a state visit years ago I wrote a book about how the United States overthrew the government of Guatemala in 1954 the case of Guatemala is a great example of American covert action during the period of the 1950s when covert action was at a peak the country lost its legitimate government and hundreds of people lost their lives there's real CFO the same as here so motivos people can gather around immortal killer or any Ariana the river but I mean for one for we had no pocket misaligned at this time a giant American company the united fruit company owned a huge amounts of land in Guatemala and much of that land they were not using it was just being held vacant while many Guatemalans or starving because they didn't have land to grow food muy bien por que bien Arado drum play God oh he knows parang and in PR poor voltron quito de lo que muchos de Angulo be upon you quantity of

government decreed a land reform program this land reform program would have forced the United Fruit Company to sell its unused land so it could be divided up and given to poor families the United Fruit Company was very unhappy with this they went to the United States government the US government then concluded that the socialist orientation of Guatemala was dangerous to the United States but the moment Arbenz tried to prevent his people being robbed by the American United Fruit Company it was seen as a threat to the holy of holies property respect democracy and independence all but

Guatemala for decades and we placed that country under heavy military rule later civil war broke out something like 200,000 people were killed in that conflict over more than 30 years en este tiempo

MPX still Jakob I existed I want castle dijo I was poor the stone temple of a certain experimental and that all was a long-term result of an intervention the United States staged in 1954 because we

convince ourselves that that company is our geopolitical enemy and then we sell the intervention as humanitarian intervention we only do it to help them we don't do anything for ourselves in fact we sacrifice ourselves for the good of others American involvement in the overthrow of the government of Libya the government of Muammar Qaddafi was another example that calls on a number of impulses in

Keanu Sai and I am a Hawaiian political scientists in 1893 in my country was invaded by the United States and we've been under an illegal and prolonged occupation ever since I've dedicated my life to not only finding out why the United States invaded my country but also how to bring the occupation to an end Hawaii was a long-term American project it began with religious missionaries they left from Boston in the 1820s to go to Hawaii and live there to spend the rest of their lives civilizing the poorer savages and barbarians as we saw lived in Hawaii this is Yolanda palace here in the background this was the executive monarchs building Hawaii by 1893 was already a constitutional monarchy so it had three separate branches of government executive which was here legislative and judicial which is across the street azita if you want to show us a bit about the palace so please please show us sure the Omani palace had electric lights four years before the White House in Washington DC well and according to a New York engineering magazine by 1889 Honolulu probably had more phones per person than any other city of its same size anywhere in the world as we like new technology - that's impressive this is a portrait of the last queen of Hawaii me do Kalani she succeeded her brother on the throne in 1891 and was deposed in 1893 leader of these white Hawaiians actually came to Washington to win permission from the President of the United States to overthrow the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii he received that permission he went home he organized a coup in which the Hawaiian Kingdom was overthrown American marines were quickly landed to secure the new white government and a few years later Hawaii became part of the United States so this is the place that US Marines landed so this road here is where they marched from Honolulu Harbor and they occupied this location right here when they invaded my country the Hawaiian Kingdom so what I have here is the actual map from 1893 the presidential investigation they were in between arian Hall and Music Hall so let me get make that a little bit bigger we are right here so where we're at right now this is where camp Smith this is headquarters for the Pacific Command and it overlooks Pearl Harbor and Pearl Harbor is a naval base for the United States so it falls under the command structure of the Pacific Command Hawaii was taken by the United States were invaded in order for the United States to control Pearl Harbor because of Hawaii's location it's central central in the Central Pacific so there's a central location that ships could enter Hawaii ports after disarming refurbish leave Hawaiian ports rearm and go back fighting money by greed installation there represents all the things that was happening it will be between 1890 and 1930 so we see rising up out of the lens out of the ocean are these giant monsters that are actually draped with documentation of annexation documentation that basically saying we're right that's what we are were the inevitable truth and they're actually so it's also propaganda at I'm saying that from the newspapers that we're seeing being never done and it was part of Hawaii's religion and men were the one who normally danced the hula we're not trying to convince people that this is not America we are merely educating people within the school system to understand the true history of Hawaii that speaks to this narrative that is true that this was never America you don't want to square off in perpendicular open your chest that's why we have you guys do this I don't I'm not making professional you hate drawers I'm giving you guys insight during the days of Captain Cook and Makahiki people actually died in these games that's how serious they took these games so this is just introducing the students into that part of boys culture and then they'll be infinite sculpture class making their own instruments in the old style good this is my colleague professor color become more he teaches Hawaiian studies at the University of Hawaii color Vytas PhD is in political science and his research operates from the premise that the Hawaiian Kingdom continues to exist as the United States took over here a lot of our traditional cultural practices fell by the wayside and there's a lot of different reasons why I guess one of the things that is missing here at the university is understanding the civics aspect of how the Hawaiian Kingdom operated and I think we hadn't we had a good discussion there yeah right right it's right now this island for example is one of the biggest US military bases on the planet Earth and for which they paid next to nothing for that land negotiations with the United States on first of all discussions on whether not we want those bases to continue here or not would be an interesting discussion to enter into and then any sort of arrangement with the United States would actually involve actual monetary exchange for the use of land Hawaii status as a country is what it was not what we want it to be and that's what we share with our students so if Hawaii was an independent state and it was a neutral state like a Switzerland yeah really it's international law that's gonna be that leverage to address the wrongs as far as our people and and our students is for as far as what we teach here we're really engaging them on on how to live in a kingdom because right now the kingdom is you know we don't live in a kingdom and we live in a republic controlled by the United States yeah we've developed an unusual view of the world because of our location we have huge oceans in a couple of weeks in Mexico and Canada therefore we've never had to have a foreign policy of clear cooperation with others we've been able because of our power to impose our will on others what these are my friends artists Melia and Solomon what I express through education of Hawaii's history they express through visual symbols in their paintings so why is history so important from an artist's perspective in dealing with today the history is important because the work isn't done yet and we want to be able to make explicit what happened and so we want to help people understand the history of loss of language of denigration of culture of pain of sorrow of suffering of genocide I would just make this one observation about the great ancient historian Thucydides so if the Citadis wrote a famous history of the Peloponnesian wars what he observes is the war or the conflict does not usually break out with the bigger the smaller country pushing up and pushing up and finally attacking that's not what happens it's usually the bigger country that gets worried and then attacks and you can see this pattern through history they call it sometimes the Thucydides trap and it's dangerous for the future because we the United States is the power that's been used to being on the top and is now being challenged what we're here at halau ku mana charter school high school level there were gonna be visiting we're gonna we're gonna try to look at some of the genesis of these patriotic acts because like we talked about in our class which is about power history very good we talked about dr. hon honey cane and her look at how history was distorted its figured and destroyed like France for known says right friends for long we read somewhere that stuff too hey have you share what you folks do it hello come on just kind of turn it over to you and your class it's important even more so now that we arm our students with a strong sense of culture a strong sense of identity and also a strong sense of history a strong sense of nationality a strong sense of truth and of justice and those are the things that we really rest our teachings on as a social studies curriculum here at halau ku mana so in 1843 like we already know Hawaii was his standing national was his nation state and for fifty years we celebrate into 1893 when we know that the United States of America illegally overthrew now how did the United States maintain that power despite having no legal authority military here you guys when I said military threat of force violence perhaps how else do they maintain power in Hawaii overpopulation we just talked about how many guys spending at two hours a day in traffic those are all Americans are winning guy what's yours how else is power maintained politics politics thank you dress American right we watch American programming right the radio TV watch American sports so the Americanization process that the nationalization of Hawaii happens my body and spirit well you folks are the movie matrix okay you know kion was my cousin Oh Keanu Reeves yeah he's my cousin so he's Neil in the movie and I'm Neil in real life and I took the red pill you guys remember top Hill yeah and you can only see the matrix if you take the pill right I took the pill and I call this recovering memory that's all we're doing we are recovering our memory you know Kiki no me come on a new email wanna know who make a locum aqua poop cake are Kumiko Mahalo waka ama Aloha oh mama we are the evidence of the D nationalization we are the evidence of the war crime we are not the war crimes ourselves what Hawaii already is an independent country all that was overthrown in 1893 was our government by the United States not our country so our country is still an independent state but we're not in control of our independence we're occupied we can be touched thank you Wow oh my me stories that encourage people to ask themselves how much do we love a great week we quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly cake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake bake this book overthrow is an attempt to show the times that America overthrew foreign governments over a long period the United States at least in a relative sense is declining in power in the world and we can still remain and I believe will still remain a potent dominant force in the world but we need to accept that the conditions of past decades don't exist anymore and we're not used to this we're not ready for this psychologically Americans have always been on top we think of ourselves as always getting our way and we're entering into a period when that's not gonna be so easy the challenge is can we adapt our habit of dominance to a more equal multipolar world
