Wow what a way to curry favor with the judge in Australia a man is on trial for terrorism charges and his case got off to a rocky start even before the first piece of evidence was submitted thanks to the accused terrorists wife being ejected from the courtroom the reason she wouldn't remove her face veil cue the outrage well kudos to Aussie Judge Christopher Beal for drawing a line in the sand regarding face masks in his courtroom namely if you want your case to be heard in Beals courtroom you'd best make your face visible or take a seat outside alas the shrouded spouse of a man on trial for terrorism chose option number two and already the cries of Islamophobia are being screamed throughout the Land of Oz by the usual suspects of course the thing is judge Beale isn't an islamaphobe he was merely following the rules you can't even wear a hat or a cap in an Aussie courtroom or sunglasses in fact you can't even wear sunglasses on top of your head so if that sort of stuff is offside then donning something that resembles Black Panthers facemask isn't just over the line it'll blitter rates the line regardless several Australian Islamic leaders are frothing mad that the judge is following the rules for example Adel Salman the vice president of the Islamic Council of Victoria said the judge's decision affected the women's human rights quote wearing the niqab is something that woman who wear it take very seriously to ask her to remove the niqab I think was an unreasonable request end quote even worse are the useful idiot apologists just check out the column in The Sydney Morning Herald by Duncan fine entitled when judges wear wigs and robes what's so offensive about a niqab yes good old leftist moral equivalence it is we who have it wrong in the West whereas though subscribing to fundamentalist Islam are beacons of light and reason so let us have the tail wag the dog in the name of cultural sensitivity all of which goes approve that those jurisdictions that are enacting burka bands are indeed on the right track in terms of standing up to this sort of Sharia creep Quebec passed it's no facemask law last year and Denmark is poised to become the latest European country to ban the full Islamic face veil regarding the burqa and the niqab Danish justice minister Soren Pape Olsen stated quote it is incompatible with the values in Danish society and disrespectful to the community to keep one's face hidden when meeting each other in public spaces end quote oh if only we could hear such words emanating from our prime minister that would make for the best speech and people kind still what makes the Australian courtroom controversy that much more disturbing is that the rules regarding head wear and even anything that remotely conceals the face such as sunglasses have always been in place these rules target Outback Jack just as much as they do facemask f√°tima so why is it that we must reinvent the wheel why must we show so-called reasonable accommodation to those who have no intention to obey the rules of the Western democracies they reside in including a woman who's the wife of a man that stands accused of terrorism in the name of Allah for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
