HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM FOR SARAH 
SANDERS IS SPEAKING TO THE 
REPORTERS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
TWO WEEKS. 
>>  HIS NOMINATION WAS DELAYED. 
IT'S INEXCUSABLE THAT DEMOCRATS 
HAVE DELAYED CONFIRMING THE 
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES AND EVEN 
WORSE EXAMPLE OF UNNECESSARY 
DELAY IS THE NOMINATION OF DON 
STUMP TO BE A COMMISSIONER ON 
THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING 
COMMISSION. 
THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO HER 
AND SHE HAS BEEN WAITING 400 
DAYS. 
WE URGE DEMOCRATS TO STOP THESE 
UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND CONFIRM 
THESE NOMINEES. 
LASTLY ON BEHALF OF THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE 
WE OFFER PRAYERS FOR UNITED 
STATES SECRET SERVICE SPECIAL 
AGENT NOEL EDWARD -- AND HIS 
FAMILY INCLUDING HIS WIFE AND 
CHILDREN. 
THE SECRET SERVICE ANNOUNCED 
THIS MORNING THAT THE AGENT 
SUFFERED A STROKE WHILE ON DUTY 
IN SCOTLAND LAST WEEK AND HAS 
PASSED AWAY. 
HE WAS A FIVE YEAR VETERAN OF 
THE UNITED STATES MARINES AND 
SPENT 19 YEAR WAS THE SECRET 
SERVICE. 
THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST 
LADY ARE DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR 
HIS LIFETIME OF DEVOTION TO HIS 
COUNTRY AND THE MEN AND WOMEN 
OF THE SECRET SERVICE MAKE HUGE 
SACRIFICES AND WE ARE FOREVER 
IN THEIR DEBT. 
WITH THAT I WILL TAKE YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 
MAJOR. 
>>  EARLIER THE PRESIDENT WAS 
ASKED IS RUSSIA STILL TARGETING 
THE UNITED STATES AND HE SAID 
NO. 
IS NAH WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVE. 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION 
AND IS HIS POSITION THAT NO, 
RUSSIA IS NOT DOING ANYTHING TO 
INTERFERE OR MEDDLE IN THE 2018 
ELECTION? 
>>  YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK 
WITH THE PRESIDENT AFTER THE 
COMMENTS. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS -- SAID THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH AND WAS SAYING NO 
TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION ARE WORKING VERY 
HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT RUSSIA 
IS UNABLE TO MEDDLE IN OUR 
ELECTIONS AS THEY HAVE DONE IN 
THE PAST AND AS WE HAVE STATED. 
>>  HE DOES BELIEVE IT'S GOING 
ON? 
>>  SINCE THERE IS CURRENTLY NO 
ELECTION TODAY, NOT 
SPECIFICALLY BUT WE BELIEVE 
THAT WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO 
MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T DO IT 
AGAIN UNLIKE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS. 
THIS PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY 
TAKING BOLD ACTION AND REFORM 
TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
AGAIN. 
HE DOES BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD 
TARGET CERTAINLY UNITED STATES 
ELECTIONS AGAIN. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT AND THE -- 
INAWED WHO SAID THE RED LIGHTS 
ARE BLINKING ON THIS TOPIC. 
>>  AS I JUST SAID THAT'S WHY 
WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE 
THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN 
AGAIN. 
WE WOULDN'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME 
AND EFFORT IF WE DIDN'T BELIEVE 
THEY WERE STILL LOOKING AT US. 
FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION THE PRESIDENT 
HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTION TO 
DEFEND OUR ELECTION SYSTEM FROM 
MEDDLING AND INTERFERENCE. 
I WILL READ THROUGH A FEW OF 
THE THINGS WE ARE DOING. 
IN MAY OF 2017 THE PRESIDENT 
SIGNED AN ORDER TO STRENGTH KEN 
REVIEW THE CYBER SECURITY OF 
THE NATION. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN 
WORKING WITH ALL 50 STATES 
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE 
COMPANIES TO IMPROVE ELECTION 
SECURITY. 
DHS HAS INCREASED COORDINATION 
AMONG ALL ELECTION PARTNERS, 34 
STATES, 53 COUNTY AND LOCAL -- 
DHS PLANS TO PROVIDE ON SITE 
RISK TO ALL STATE THAT REQUEST 
IF. 
SO FAR 18 STATES HAVE REQUESTED 
THIS ASSESSMENT. 
A NEW PILOT PROGRAM WAS 
LAUNCHED TO INCREASE RAPID 
RESPONSE ON ELECTION DAY AND IN 
2017 ON SITE CYBER SECURITY 
SUPPORT WAS PROVIDED. 
IN MARCH OF 2018 CONGRESS 
PROVIDED THE ELECTION 
ASSISTANCE COMMISSION WITH $380 
MILLION IN FUNDING FOR ELECTION 
ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO STATES. 
THESE ARE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN 
TO PREVENT IS FROM HAPPENING 
THAT WE SEE THERE IS A THREAT 
THERE. 
>>  I WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT YOU 
SAID. 
DAN COATES SAID THE THREAT IS 
STILL ONGOING FROM RUSSIA. 
DOES THIS WHITE HOUSE BELIEVE 
THAT CURRENTLY THIS THREAT IS 
STILL ONGOING? 
>>  CERTAINLY LIKE I JUST SAID 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE THREAT 
STILL EXISTS WHICH IS WHY WE 
ARE TAKING STEPS TO PREVENT IT. 
YOU WOULDN'T GO THROUGH THAT 
PROCESS IF YOU WEREN'T. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT -- CLARIFIED 
HIS COMMENTS HIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- IS THE PRESIDENT 
STAND BY ALL OF HIS OTHER 
PUBLIC COMMENTS INCLUDING 
CRITICIZING TERESA MAY'S 
HANDLING OF THE BREXIT 
NEGOTIATIONS, COMMENTS THAT 
RUSSIA -- THAT RUSSIA 
CONTROLLED GERMANY OVER -- OVER 
THAT PIPELINE AND OTHER 
COMMENTS IN THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE MONDAY WHERE HE 
CONTINUED TO CAST DOUBT ON THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S 
ASSESSMENT OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING. 
DOES HE STAND BY ALL OF THAT? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT SAW A NEED TO 
CLARIFY THE POSITION. 
HE SAW HOW HIS COMMENTS WERE 
BEING SEEN AND HE CLARIFIED. 
>>  DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE A 
RESPONSE TO THE ARREST AND 
INDICTMENT OF A RUSSIAN 
NATIONAL WHO HAS -- WHO IS 
ACCUSED OF TRYING TO GET INTO 
AMERICAN POLITICAL 
ORGANIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY ON 
THE RIGHT TO TRY TO INFLUENCE 
POLITICS? 
>>  WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT. 
JUST TO CLARIFY, THERE WAS 
MASSIVE MEDIA HYSTERIA 
YESTERDAY OVER CONFUSION 
BETWEEN THAT INDIVIDUAL AND A 
WHITE HOUSE STAFFER WHICH I 
THINK SHOWS FRANKLY THE 
OUTRAGEOUSNESS AND THE JUST 
DESIRE TO FIND THE NEGATIVE IN 
EVERYTHING THAT THIS PRESIDENT 
DOES JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS 
RED HEADED THEY WERE ACCUSED OF 
BEING SOME SORT OF SPY FOR 
RUSSIA. 
I THINK THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL. 
YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE A STEP 
BACK, SLOW DOWN AND QUIT GOING 
AFTER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
 
TAKES PLACE. 
>>  NO RESPONSE TO THE 
INDICTMENT? 
>>  I SAID WE ARE LOOKING AT 
IT. 
THIS IS A LONG PROCESS. 
WE ARE GOING THROUGH IT. 
HOWEVER, I DO HAVE A RESPONSE 
TO THE FACT THAT BECAUSE 
SOMEONE HAD THE SAME HAIR COLOR 
THEY WERE ACCUSED OF BEING A 
RUSSIA SPY BY PEOPLE IN THIS 
ROOM. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT TODAY AND 
SECRETARY OF STATE BOTH SPOKE 
ABOUT PROGRESS BEING MADE IN 
TALKS, TRADE TALKS WITH MEXICO 
AND I'M WONDERING IF TALKS WITH 
MEXICO AND CANADA AND ALSO THE 
TALKS WITH CANADA ARE 
EFFECTIVELY OFF THE TABLE FOR 
NOW? 
IS THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDING 
TO GO WITH MEXICO WHERE THEY 
SEE IF -- THERE IS PROGRESS AND 
FORGET ABOUT THE. 
>>  WE ARE CONTINUING BOTH OF 
THOSE TRACKS. 
WE SEE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE 
CONVERSATIONS WITH MEXICO AND 
IF WE COULD MAKE A DEAL WITH 
THEM WE ARE CERTAINLY VERY 
HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT WE ARE 
CONTINUING BOTH CONVERSATIONS, 
BOTH TRACKS. 
>>  RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES NAMED 
AMERICANS THEY WANT TO QUESTION 
WHO THEY CLAIM WERE INVOLVED IN 
CRIMES IN THEIR TERMS INCLUDING 
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT THAT 
IDEA? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT WILL MEET 
WITH HIS TEAM AND WE WILL LET 
YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT. 
>>  DID PRESIDENT PUTIN RAISE 
THAT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
>>  THERE WAS CONVERSATION BUT 
NOT A COMMITMENT MADE AND THE 
PRESIDENT WILL WORK WITH HIS 
TEAM. 
>> THE PRESIDENT EARLIER TODAY 
SAID THERE COULD BE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE EU IF 
THERE IS NOT A DEAL STRUCK ON 
AUTO IMPORTS. 
IN THE PAST HE HAS TALKED ABOUT 
POSSIBLY PUTTING A TARIFF OF 
20%. 
IS THAT WHAT HE MEANT? 
>>  THAT'S AN OPTION ON THE 
TABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
CONSIDERING. 
WE ARE IN THE INVESTIGATION 
PROCESS RIGHT NOW. 
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
>>  YOU BROUGHT UP THE FED. 
THE BEIGE BOOK JUST CAME OUT 
WHICH IS FROM ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THE 
ECONOMY. 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE HEADLINES. 
MANUFACTURES ARE DEALING HIGHER 
PRICES, THEY ARE INCREASING 
AGRICULTURE AND -- IT'S NOT 
NECESSARILY A ROSY PICTURE WITH 
THE TARIFF SITUATION. 
YOUR RESPONSE TO THOSE 
HEADLINES WOULD BE WHAT? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON 
LONG TERM. 
WE HAVE ONE OF THE STRONGEST 
ECONOMIES THAT WE HAVE HAD IN 
DECADES. 
CONTINUES TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO 
HELP PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT ON 
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FRONTS 
AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. 
AGAIN THIS IS SHORT TERM. 
THE PRESIDENT HOPES TO OPEN UP 
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MARKETS 
AND TO CREATE A MORE PLAYING 
TRADE FIELD ACROSS THE GLOBE. 
>>  TWO QUESTIONS. 
FIRST, PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN 
TALKING ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE 
UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE, HE SAID THAT -- BOTH 
-- I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN BOTH 
PARTY. 
AFTER A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED 
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA 
AFTER PROTESTING NEONAZIS HE 
SAID I THINK THERE IS BLAME ON 
BOTH SIDES. 
SOME SEE IT AS THE PRESIDENT 
MAKING FALSE COMPARISONS. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? 
>>  I WOULDN'T COMPARE THE TWO 
SITUATIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT, I THINK, SAID 
EXACTLY WHAT HE THOUGHT 
YESTERDAY IN HIS REMARKS AND I 
WOULD REFER YOU BACK TO THOSE. 
>>  GO HEAD. 
>>  ALSO, DOES THE PRESIDENT -- 
SEE THE INTERFERENCE IN THE 
ELECTION AND POSSIBLY IN THE 
MIDTERMS AS AN ATTACK ON 
DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN, UNITED 
STATES -- THE SECRETARY FOR 
HOMELAND SECURITY SAID IT WAS 
AN ATTACK ON AMERICAN DEMO 
CRACA AND -- WE SEE IT AS AN 
ISSUE OF IT OR JUST HIS 
OPPONENTS BEING ATTACK ? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT THINKS WE 
HAVE TO FOCUS ON SECURING OUR 
ELECTION AND OUR ELECTION 
SYSTEMS WHICH IS WHY HE HAS 
SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH HIS 
ADMINISTRATION MAKING SURE THAT 
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. 
LET'S NOT FORGET THIS DIDN'T 
HAPPEN UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
WATCH. 
THIS HAPPENED UNDER THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
WE ARE TAKING STEPS. 
WE ARE MAKING BOLDER REFORMS TO 
TRY TO FIX THIS AND MAKE SURE 
IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN BECAUSE 
WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND WE 
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR ELECTION 
SYSTEM IS IMPORTANT AND A 
CORNER STONE OF THE GOVERNMENT. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT. 
>>  TWO -- THE PRESIDENT SPENT 
TOUR HOURS AND TEN MINUTES WITH 
PUTIN. 
WAS THERE A DEAL MADE ON SYRIA, 
ANYTHING? 
CAN YOU GIVE US ANY SENSE OF 
WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT MEETING? 
>>  AS THE PRESIDENT SAID A 
NUMBER OF ISSUES WERE RAISED 
INCLUDING SYRIA, IRAN'S NUCLEAR 
AMBITION, ISRAELI SECURITY, 
NORTH KOREA, UKRAINE. 
REDUCING RUSSIAN AND UNITED 
STATES ARSENALS AND YOUR 
FAVORITE TOPIC, RUSSIA'S 
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS. 
ALL OF THESE ISSUES WERE TALKED 
ABOUT. 
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE 
DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA AND OUR 
ADMINISTRATION AND THEIRS AND 
WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING 
THROUGH THOSE THINGS. 
THOSE WERE ALL OF THE TOPICS 
AND CERTAINLY PROBABLY OTHERS 
THAT WERE COVERED. 
>>  ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES FROM 
CRIMEA TO THE ELECTION MEDDLIN 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE 
SPENT MORE TIME CRITICIZING 
OBAMA FOR LETTING IT HAPPEN 
UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION THAN 
PUTIN. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHY 
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T BEEN MORE 
CRITICAL OF PUTIN FOR SOME OF 
THESE EVENTS THAT THE WORLD 
STAGE HAS REALLY GONE AFTER HIM 
ABOUT? 
>>  I THINK THE PRESIDENT AS HE 
HAS SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE HAS 
BEEN TOUGHER ON RUSSIA THAN 
ANYONE. 
I THINK YOU CAN SEE NAH IN ALL 
OF THE ACTIONS THAT HE HAS 
TAKEN WHETHER ITS WHAT A PLANT 
THAT WAS CLOSED DUE TO TARIFFS 
PUT IN PLACE BY THE PRESIDENT, 
THE TREASUREY DEPARTMENT HAS 
ISSUED NEW SANCTIONS ON 
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IN 
RUSSIA. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT IN 
SANCTIONS. 
WE HAVE EXPELLED 60 OPERATIVES 
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND 
CLOSED TWO CONSULATES. 
THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNED RUSSIA 
FOUR TIMES, AUTHORIZED MILITARY 
STRIKES AGAINST THE ASSAD 
GOVERNMENT IN SYRIA AND HAS 
CALLED OUT THEIR ACTIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY 
TOUGH ON RUSSIA AND TO SAY 
ANYTHING DIFFERENT IS JUST NOT 
TRUE. 
>>  OTHER WORLD LEADERS BY NAME 
FAR MORE OFTEN THAN PUTIN. 
WHY WON'T HE CRITICIZE PUTIN BY 
NAME? 
>>  I THINK HE HAS. 
I THINK HE HAS CALLED THEM OUT 
FOR INTERFERING IN THE 
ELECTION. 
HE HAS BEEN TOUGH ON RUSSIA AND 
HE HAS TAKEN ACTION AGAINST 
RUSSIA ON A NUMBER OF FRONT 
THAT I JUST LISTED OFF. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
ONE AT A TIME. 
>>  WHY WASN'T HE CRITICAL OF 
PUTIN ACTIONS? 
>>  THEY HAD A NUMBER OF 
CONVERSATIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT DISCUSSED SOME OF 
THESE THINGS DIRECTLY FACE TO 
FACE WITH PUTIN. 
HE ADDRESSED THEM AGAIN 
YESTERDAY. 
HE ALSO SEES THIS AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY AS HE SAID MANY 
TIMES TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH 
RUSSIA. 
90% OF THE WORLD'S NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS ARE UNDER THE DIRECTION 
OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
RUSSIA. 
HE THINKS IT'S A GOOD THING TO 
GET ALONG WITH THE OTHER PERSON 
THAT CONTROLS THAT MUCH OF THE 
NUCLEAR ARSENAL. 
HE WANTS TO CREATE A MORE 
STABLE AND PEACEFUL WORLD IF WE 
CAN'T DO THAT IF WE CAN'T GET 
ALONG WITH RUSSIA. 
WE HAVE CALLED HIM OUT. 
WE HAVE BEEN TOUGH. 
WE HAVE APPROACHED THIS IN A 
DIFFERENT FASHION THAT HAS BEEN 
PREVIOUSLY DONE. 
IN THE PAST WHAT'S BEEN DONE 
HASN'T WORKED. 
TO ABOUT LIKE HE HASN'T BEEN 
TOUGH, HASN'T CALLED THEM OUT 
ISN'T TRUE AND IT CHANGES 
EVERYTHING THAT THIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE IN 
REGARDS TO THAT COUNTRY. 
I WILL KEEP GOING. 
>>  YOU DESCRIBED THE NEGATIVE 
IMPACTS OF THE TRADE CONFLICT 
WITH CHINA, THE SHORT TERM. 
THAT'S ONLY TRUE IF WE ARE ABLE 
TO STRIKE A BETTER DEAL. 
FROM THE OUTSIDE SINCE THE 
TARIFFS WENT ON IT SEEMS LIKE 
THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BROKEN 
DOWN. 
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD 
TELL US ABOUT THE STATUS AND 
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO RESTART 
THE TALKS IN. 
>>  I WON'T NEGOTIATE WITH YOU. 
I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE 
SECRETARY AND AMBASSADOR. 
WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE 
CONVERSATIONS WITH CHINA. 
WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK FOR 
WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER 
TRADE DEAL. 
>>  SHE ASKED ABOUT THE IDEA 
THAT PUTIN OFFERED OF 
ESSENTIALLY LETTING THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL TO GO TO RUSSIA TO SEE 
THE INTERROGATIONS OF THE 
RUSSIAN MILITARY AFTER IFS THE 
UNITED STATES WOULD HAVE 
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATORS COME HERE 
TO WATCH AMERICAN CITIZENS FACE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CRIMES THEY 
ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN RUSSIA. 
THE PRESIDENT CALLED IT AN 
INTERESTING IDEA. 
HE SAID IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE 
OFFER. 
WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT? 
>>  HE SAID IT WAS AN 
INTERESTING IDEA. 
HE WANTS TO WORK WITH HIS TEAM 
AND DETERMINE IF THERE IS ANY 
VALIDITY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL 
TO THE PROCESS. 
WE HAVE COMMITTED TO NOTHING. 
>>  SOME DEMOCRATS ON CAPITOL 
HILL SAY THEY WANT TO DRAG THE 
TRANSLATOR IN THE ROOM WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AND PUTIN BEFORE 
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES TO 
FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID 
IN THE PRIVATE MEETING. 
IS THAT SOMETHING THE WHITE 
HOUSE WOULD SUPPORT? 
>>  THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD 
GO THROUGH THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. 
>>  THE LIST OF SUBJECTS YOU 
WENT THROUGH AS FAR AS THE 
MEETING, WERE SANCTIONS, DOESED 
AT ALL? 
DID THE PRESIDENT BRING IT UP 
OR DID PUTIN BRING IT UP TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
>>  I'M NOT AWARE. 
I WOULD HAVE TO ASK. 
>>  JUST ONE -- YESTERDAY THE 
PRESIDENT'S REVISION -- IT WAS 
JUST KIND OF SEEN THAT HE WAS 
LEAVING HIMSELF ROOM WHEN HE 
SAID THERE COULD HAVE BEEN 
OTHERS TOO WHO MEDDLED. 
WAS HE REFERRING TO ANY 
SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE ON THAT 
OR WAS THAT HIS INSTINCT? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES A 
NUMBER OF BRIEFINGS AND HAS 
TALKED ABOUT THIS 
SUBJECTTENSIVELY. WE SUBJECT. 
>>  I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT 
SOMETHING YOU SAID. 
DESPITE THE VIDEO THAT SHOWS 
THE PRESIDENT LOOKING AT 
ANSWERING NO ABOUT RUSSIA STILL 
TARGETING THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
PRESIDENT HAVING NEVER SAID NO 
TO. 
>>  HE SAID NO ONE TIME. 
>>  THIS IS THE FIRST THING 
THAT HE SAID THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH AND NO I'M NOT ANSWERING 
ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND EVEN 
FURTHER I THINK THAT -- EVEN 
SHE DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT THE 
ANSWER GAS BECAUSE SHE ASKED 
FOR CLARITY AND HE DIDN'T 
ANSWER THE FOLLOW UP. 
AGAIN. 
I -- SHE WASN'T SURE. 
I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT. 
HE WASN'T ANSWERING THAT 
QUESTION. 
HE WAS SAYING NO. 
HE IS NOT TAKING QUESTIONS AND 
I HAVE STATED WHAT OUR 
POSITIONS. 
>>  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME 
THAT THE PRESIDENT OR THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAS COME OUT AND REVERSED 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID. 
>>  ACTUALLY I'M SAYING WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT SAID. 
I'M NOT REVERSING IT. 
I WAS IN THE ROOM AND I DIDN'T 
TAKE IT THE WAY YOU DID. 
>>  WHY SHOULD HE HAVE ANY 
CREDIBLE IN WHAT HE SAYS IF 24 
HOURS LATER OR THREE HOURS 
LATER THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS JUST 
KIDDING? 
>>  FIRST OF ALL THAT'S NOT 
WHAT I SAID. 
I WAS INTERPRETING WHAT HIS 
INGE TENSION WAS. 
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU JUST 
EXPLAINED. 
WE NEVER SAID JUST KIDDING. 
I THINK -- I THINK THAT YOU CAN 
TAKE THE FACT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS CREDITABILITY 
BECAUSE HE SAW THAT HE HAD 
MISSPOKEN AND HE WANTED TO 
CLARIFY YESTERDAY WHICH HE DID. 
WHEN HE SEES THAT HE IS 
MISSPOKE HE SAYS THAT. 
I WILL KEEP MOVING. 
JORDON GO HEAD. 
I WILL GO HEAD. 
YOU HAVE ASKED TWO. 
>>  ONCE AGAINST I'M MOVING 
ONTO JORDON. 
GO HEAD. 
>>  SORRY. 
GO HEAD IF YOU WANT. 
ACTUALLY I WILL TAKE A QUESTION 
FROM JORDON. 
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US 
REMEMBER -- I DON'T REMEMBER A 
TIME WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS 
PUBLICLY CALLED  OUT PUTIN. 
BY SAYING THAT RUSSIA 
INTERFERED THE RUSSIA. 
THAT'S A PRETTY BOLD CALL OUT 
ú 
. 
>>  OR IN THE FUTURE. 
WOULD THE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SUPPORT PROPOSAL LIKE THAT? 
>>  I WON'T GET INTO 
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS UNTIL 
WE SEE A FINAL PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION AND ALSO A 
DETERMINATION IF THERE IS 
ELECTION MEDDLING. 
AGAIN OUR GOAL IS TO STOP THAT 
FROM HAPPENING WHICH IS WHY WE 
HAVE SPENT SUCH A SIGNIFICANT 
AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE FIRST 
YEAR AND A HALF OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION FOCUSING ON 
PROTECTING THE ELECTION. 
JOHN. 
JOHN GO HEAD. 
SORRY. 
GUYS. 
IF WE COULD GO ON PEOPLE THAT I 
HAVE CALLED ON. 
>>  IS VOTER SUPPRESSION PART 
OF THAT ELECTION PROCESS THAT 
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO LOOK 
FOR? 
YOU AREN'T GOING TO ANSWER 
THAT? 
>>  IF I CALL ON YOU I WILL BE 
HAPPY TO ANSWER. 
JOB GO HEAD. 
>>  YOU AREN'T GOING TO ANSWER 
ME. 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. 
FINE. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE 
IMMEDIATE REACTION TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS THAT HE 
MADE AT THAT JOINT PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
IT WAS IMMEDIATE. 
EVERY CABLE CHANNEL, FOX, NBC, 
CNN REACTED IMMEDIATELY TO THE 
SUGGESTION THAT THE PRESIDENT 
MADE THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE 
THAT RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. 
I GOT MY INBOX HIT WITH E-MAILS 
FROM REPUBLICANS FROM CONGRESS 
WITH THEIR REACTION IMMEDIATELY 
AND 24 HOURS, 24 HOURS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT 20 CORRECT THE 
RECORD. 
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THE 
PRESIDENT TO CLARIFY THE 
COMMENTS THAT HE MADE? 
>>  LOOK. 
THE PRESIDENT PUT OUT AN 
INITIAL TWEET AFTER BOARDING 
AIR FORCE ONE THAT CLARIFIED 
HIS COMMENTS ON THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS 
CLEAR AND AT THE FIRST CHANCE 
HE HAD IN A PUBLIC SETTING THE 
FOLLOWING DAY HE CLARIFIED HIS 
COMMENTS AND I DON'T THINK THAT 
IT WAS THAT LONG FOR THAT TO BE 
THE VERY FIRST PUBLIC 
APPEARANCE THAT HE HAD AFTER 
ARRIVING BACK TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>>  IT'S A PRETTY LONG TIME. 
IT WAS OUT THERE FOR QUITE A 
TIME. 
>>  IT WASN'T 24 HOURS BEFORE 
HE RESPONDED AT ALL. 
AGAIN. 
HE PUT OUT THE TWEET FROM AIR 
FORCE ONE. 
>>  COMMENT ON THIS TO CLARIFY 
HIS REMARKS TO CHANGE THE WOULD 
TO WOULDN'T OR THE WOULDN'T TO 
WOULD AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE 
WAS TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT. 
HE TWEETS ALL THE TIME FROM AIR 
FORCE ONE. 
>> AND HE  T TWEETED THAT 
NIGHT. 
>>  WHAT TOOK SO LONG? 
>>  ONCE HE REVIEWED THE 
TRANSCRIPT HE WANTED TO 
PUBLICLY ADDRESS THE CLARITY 
AND WHICH HE DID. 
>>  . 
>>  EFFORTS WITH IN CONGRESS TO 
IMPEACH DEPUTY ATTORNEY, IS 
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE WOULD SUPPORT FOR LACK OF 
COOPERATION? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 
CLEAR HE WANTS ALL DOCUMENTS 
TURNED OVER BUT WE ARE 
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER. 
JIM, GO HEAD. 
>>  FOLLOW UP. 
>>  SORRY. 
>>  WOULD THE WHITE HOUSE 
DENOUNCE THAT EFFORT? 
DO THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE THE DOCUMENTS TURNED OVER. 
WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE 
IN SOMEONE WE WILL LET YOU 
KNOW. 
>>  ON THE FRIDAY OF THE PRESS 
CONDITION CONFERENCE WITH PRIME 
MINISTER MAY I ASKED IF HE 
WOULD TELL PUTIN TO STAY OUT OF 
ELECTIONS AND HE SAID YES. 
DID HE TELL PUTIN TO STAY OUT 
OF ELECTIONS IN. 
>>  CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT AS 
HE AND PUTIN SAID DISCUSSED 
ELECTION MEDDLING. 
I THINK WE HAVE MADE THAT VERY 
CLEAR. 
>>  DID THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES TELL THE 
PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA TO STAY OUT 
OF UNITED STATES ELECTIONS? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 
CLEAR TO PUTIN THAT HE SHOULD 
STAY OUT OF UNITED STATES 
ELECTIONS. 
I WILL KEEP MOVING. 
APRIL, GO HEAD. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
SORRY JIM I WILL TAKE A COUPLE 
LAST QUESTIONS. 
>>  WAS THERE A RECORDING MADE 
OF THEIR MEETING? 
>>  I'M NOT AWARE OF ONE. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT IS CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE ELECTION PROCESS. 
YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT HE IS 
DOING. 
YOU DIDN'T MENTION VOTER 
SUPPRESSION. 
ITS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR DECADES. 
PARTICULARLY IN THESE LAST FEW 
 
TABLE WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
VOTER FRAUD, PEOPLE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT VOTER 
SUPPRESSION. 
IS THAT ON THE TABLE? 
>>  WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING 
WITH IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT 
THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTIONS 
AND WE  WILL LOOK AT THAT. 
I ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BECAUSE 
OF RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 
PAST. 
>>  I WANT TO CHANGE TOPIC A 
MINUTE IF I MAY AND GO SOUTH. 
>>  SURE. 
THAT WOULD BE FINE. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  THE INCOMING PRESIDENT OF 
MEXICO HAS MADE TWO VERY BOLD 
SUGGESTIONS. 
NUMBER ONE, HE IS LOOKING AT 
GIVEN AMNESTY TO THE DRUG 
CARTELS OPERATING WITH IN 
THERE. 
TODAY THEY COME OUT AND SAY 
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY LOOKING AT 
LEGALIZING ALL DRUGS IN MEXICO. 
IF THEY DO THAT IT'LL HAVE A 
HUGE IMPACT ON THE INCOMING 
AMOUNT OF DRUGS IN TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
POSITION ON THAT AND ARE THEY 
GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO STOP 
THAT FROM HAPPENING? 
>>  CERTAINLY WE ARE GOING TO 
CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH OUR 
MEXICAN PARTNERS. 
I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC POLICY. 
WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT LEGALIZING 
ALL DRUGS ANYWHERE AND WOULDN'T 
WANT DO TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD 
LET MORE DRUGS COME INTO THIS 
COUNTRY. 
THANK YOU. 
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 
>>  WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION 
DOING ABOUT  
AND USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA? 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
WE WERE JUST LISTENING TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY 
GIVE A PRESS  BRIEFING. 
SHE FACED A LOT OF TOUGH 
QUESTIONS OVER THE PRESIDENT'S 
SUMMIT WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
PUTIN. 
SHE WAS ASKED TO CLARIFY A 
NUMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
POSITIONS. 
SHE REPEATED WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS SAID THAT NO OTHER 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN AS TOUGH ON 
RUSSIA AS PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
SHE WENT THROUGH A LIST OF 
SANCTIONS AND ACTIONS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN AGAINST 
RUSSIA. 
SHE MENTIONED THE SYRIA 
STRIKES, EXPELLING THE 60 
RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS. 
WHEN SHE WAS ASKED IF THE 
PRESIDENT HAS EVER VERBALLY 
USED STRONG WORDS WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN ABOUT ELECTION 
MEDDLING SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO 
ANSWER THAT. 
CBS NEWS MAJOR GARRET WAS AT 
THE PRESS BRIEFING AND IS HERE 
NOW. 
YOU HAD THE FIRST QUESTION OF 
THE BRIEFING. 
YOU ASKED WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT'S NEGATIV COMMENT AS 
TO IF HE BELIEVED RUSSIAN 
MEDDLING WAS ONGOING, WHETHER 
THAT REPRESENTED WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT BELIEVED, WHAT DID 
YOU MAKE OF HER RESPONSE? 
>>  THAT SHE HAD TO CORRECT IT. 
THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION 
MADE BY THE PRESIDENT THAT IT'S 
NOT HAPPENING WHICH IS A DIRECT 
CONTRADICTION OF WHAT DAN 
COATES HAS SAID. 
IT GOT IMMEDIATE REACTION FROM 
LINDSEY GRAHAM AND OTHERS. 
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WAS THE WHITE HOUSE POSITION. 
WELL, SHE HAD TO GO IN AND TALK 
TO THE PRESIDENT AND SAID NO 
THAT CAN'T BE OUR PRESIDENT. 
YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S NOT 
HAPPENING. 
IT IS HAPPENING IF. 
THANK YOU CONTINUE TO SAY IT 
ISN'T YOU ARE GOING AGAINST THE 
PEOPLE AT THE OF YOUR 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT 
YESTERDAY YOU HAD TO CORRECT TO 
SAY YOU BELIEVE. 
SECOND DAY WHERE THERE WAS THIS 
GAP CREATED BY THE PRESIDENT IN 
RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE OF 
EITHER PAST RUSSIAN MEDDLING, 
2016 OR ONGOING EFFORTS TO 
DESTABILIZE OR INFLUENCE OR GET 
INTO ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS 
THIS YEAR. 
THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS COMPLICATED ON 
HIS OWN WITH HIS OWN WORDS. 
. I KNEW IT WOULD BE A STORY SO 
I GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY IT 
OFFER A NEW PERSPECTIVE WHICH 
SHE HAD AND THEN WENT THROUGH A 
ROSTER OF THINGS THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE TO 
IDENTITY THIS ISSUE, SET ASIDE 
RESOURCES AND PROVIDE 
INFORMATION AND HELP TO STATES 
IF THEY BELIEVE THERE IS 
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE 
CHECKED FROM A CYBER SECURITY 
PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO 
ELECTION SYSTEMS. 
>>  LET'S GO THROUGH A FEW OF 
THOSE STEPS SHE SAID THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING. 
SHE SAID THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY IS WORKING 
WITH STATES TO BOLSTER THEIR 
ELECTION SECURITY. 
SHE SAID 18 STATES HAVE 
REQUESTED HELP. 
>>  CORRECT. 
ALL OF THAT MAY BE TRUE AND 
THAT'S AT THE MARGINS OF THIS 
TACTIC, MEANING THE RUSSIAN 
TACTIC AND THE UNITED STATES 
RESPONSE. 
REMEMBER, STATES RUN ELECTIONS 
AND THERE HAS TO BE A GROUP 
GOVERNMENT. 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T 
TELL STATES WHAT TO DO WITH 
CERTAIN THINGS. 
THEY HAVE TO UNDER FEDERAL LAW 
PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE BALLOT 
AND A PROCESS THAT IS FAIR AND 
EQUAL. 
IN LARGE MEASURE THE ACTIONS OF 
STATES ARE THEIR BUSINESS. 
WHATEVER STEPS THIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN 
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY OR OTHERS, 
WHAT MATTERS IN OUR CURRENT 
CONTEXT IS THE DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, DAN 
COATES, FORMER MEMBER OF THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE, AN 
PERSONSED POLITICAL LEADER 
EXPERIENCED IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
LIGHTS BLINKING ON RUSSIAN 
EFFORTS TO DESTABILIZE, MEDDLE 
WITH THE 2018 MIDTERMS. 
THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM NOW. 
THOSE COMMENTS CAME LONG AFTER 
SOME OF THESE INITIAL STEPS 
WERE TAKEN BY THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
WHATEVER STEPS THE 
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO POINT 
TOO. 
IN THE OPINION OF DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE THEY 
AREN'T ENOUGH. 
>>  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SARAH 
SANDERS COMMENTS ABOUT THE 
PRIVATE CONVERSATION. 
THEIR ONE ON ONE MEETING. 
SHE WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE 
TOPICS. 
SYRIA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA AND 
SHE MENTIONED AND -- RUSSIA 
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION. 
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD 
IT WAS SOMETHING THEY DISCUSSED 
IN THAT LITTLE MEETING. 
NOWHERE DID SHE TALK MORE ABOUT 
THAT. 
>>  SHE DIDN'T. 
AFTER A SERIES OF QUESTIONS, 
VERY POINTED QUESTIONS SHE 
FINALLY SAID THE PRESIDENT MADE 
IT CLEAR TO PUTIN DON'T MEDDLE 
IN THE 2018 ELECTION. 
THAT WASN'T THE FIRST THING SHE 
MENTIONED. 
THIS ADMINISTRTION FOR 
WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T FOCUS 
ON THAT ISSUE OR IT'S FOCUS ON 
THAT ISSUE. 
WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE 
INTERACTIONS. 
THE ONES THAT JUSTER HAPPENED 
OR THE ONES BEFORE. 
SO, IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THIS 
ADMINISTRATION BY ITSELF OWN 
WORDS AND LACK OF FOCUS SORT OF 
LEAVES DANGLING OUT THERE. 
THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS AND THE 
REMARKS THAT NEEDED ANOTHER 
POINT OF CLARITY AGAIN TODAY 
LEAVE DANGLING HOW MUCH FOCUS 
THIS ADMINISTRATION PUTS ON IT 
AND HOW SERIOUSLY IT TAKES IT. 
ON CAPITOL HILL THE VOICE THAT 
IS CARRYING THE DAY ON THIS 
QUESTION IS NOT THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
IT'S DAN COAT ES. 
>>  SURE. 
WHEN SHE WAS PRESSED ON WHY THE 
PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN MORE 
PUBLICLY CRITICAL OF PUTIN SHE 
SAID WE ARE TRYING A NEW 
APPROACH SINCE WHAT'S BEEN 
TRIED BEFORE HASN'T WORKED. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
>>  WELL. 
TO TAKE ONE ASPECT OF THE 
ENTIRE APPROACH AND GIVE THIS 
ADMINISTRATION IT'S DUE, IT HAS 
TAKEN STEPS THAT THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T TAKE, 
THAT RUSSIA DISAGREES WITH. 
FIRST OF ALL CONTINUED AND HAS 
CONTINUED ALL THE SANCTIONS PUT 
IN PLACE BY THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION AT THE END OF 
ITS RUN TO PENALIZE RUSSIA. 
THOSE SANCTIONS REMAIN. 
WHEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE NERVE 
AGENT POISONING OF A BRITISH 
CITIZEN THE UNITED STATES UNDER 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
EXPELLED MORE THAN 60 RUSSIANS 
IN THE UNITED STATES ACTING AS 
DIPLOMATS, SHUT DOWN TWO 
CONSULATES AND IT AUTHORIZED 
THE SHIPMENT OF LETHEL WEAPONS 
TO UKRAINE AS A COUNTER TO 
RUSSIA AND HAS APPROVED THE 
EXPORTATION TO EUROPE OF 
NATURAL GAS. 
ALSO SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT DO. 
ON SOME OF THESE POLICY 
MATTERS, IT IS REAL AND FAIR TO 
SAY THAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
THAT THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T TAKE THAT 
ARE IF NOT AGGRESSIVE TO 
RUSSIA, CERTAINLY ACT AS A 
UNITED STATES COUNTER WEIGHT TO 
SOME OF WHAT IT'S DONE 
RECENTLY. 
THAT'S ALL FAIR AND ACCURATE. 
WHAT IS AND HAS BEEN ABSENT IS 
THIS PRESIDENT SAYING ANYTHING 
IN PUBLIC OR IN ANY 
RELATIONSHIP WHEN ASKED ABOUT 
PUTIN THAT IS ANYTHING THAT 
COULD BE REGARDED AS CRITICAL. 
HE SAYS ABOUT HOW STRONG AND 
POWERFUL HIS DENIALS ARE. 
HOW IMPRESSED HE IS WITH THINGS 
LIKE THE WORLD CUP AND OTHER 
ASPECTS OF HIS REPRESENTATION 
OF THE INTERESTS OF THE RUSSIAN 
PEOPLE. 
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH HIS REMARKS 
ABOUT PUTIN, FIND ANYTHING 
THAT'S NEARLY AS CRITICAL AS 
WHAT MANY REPUBLICANS ARE 
WILLING TO SAY ABOUT PUTIN. 
THAT IS THE BIG DISCONNECT. 
>>  CAN YOU SHED A LITTLE LIGHT 
ON THE SUGGESTION THAT WAS 
FLOATED THAT RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATORS COME TO THE 
UNITED STATES AND INTERROGATE 
IN EXCHANGE FOR AMERICAN 
INVESTIGATORS GOING TO RUSSIA? 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS IDEA 
THAT, I BELIEVE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT CALLED AN INTERESTING 
IDEA? 
>>  HE DID SAY THAT. 
CAN TELL YOU AFTER THAT 
PRESIDENT CONFERENCE I WAS 
GETTING TEXTS WITH SOURCES WHO 
WERE -- THEY WERE GOING THROUGH 
AND VAGUELY IF NOT HORRIFIED BY 
THAT BUT THEY WERE ALARMED BY 
THAT REACTION. 
FIRST OF ALL, AS THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SOURCES 
I TALKED TO SAY WE DON'T WANT 
TO SHARE ANY OF OUR CYBER 
TOOLS, METHODS, WITH THE 
RUSSIANS. 
WE DON'T WANT TO SHARE WITH 
THEM. 
WE ARE TRYING TO STOP THEM. 
POINT 2 WE AREN'T INTERESTED IN 
HAVING RUSSIA JUSTICE 
DETERMINING WHO SHOULD BE 
INTERROGATED BY THEIR 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. 
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE 
GOING TO DO, THAT WE SHOULD DO 
OR EVEN SUGGEST WE ARE OPEN TO 
THINKING ABOUT. 
THEIR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IS 
DIFFERENT FROM OURS. 
WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IS IN SO 
GETTING THE 12 RUSSIANS 
INDICTED BY SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
THAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS. 
NOT HAVING RUSSIANS INTERROGATE 
AMERICANS WHO THEY THINK DID 
SOMETHING WRONG IN RUSSIA. 
WHAT SHE SAID TO OFFER THE BID 
OF CLARITY IS NOTHING HAS BEEN 
AGREED TOO. 
IT WAS JUST AN IDEA. 
THE RUSSIANS THREW IT OUT 
THERE. 
THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED 
SOMETHING A LOT MORE HARD LIKE 
NOT JUST NO BUT HECK NO. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
>>> AND JEFF WILL INTERVIEW THE 
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
YOU CAN SEE THAT HERE. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
MORE NEWS AHEAD. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
