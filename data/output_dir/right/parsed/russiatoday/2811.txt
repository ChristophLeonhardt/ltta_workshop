previously on the great American
pilgrimage we're about to pull up to
Mount Rushmore the most significant
monument in America isn't that just
majestic I haven't decided what my
spirit animal totally is yet yeah
narrowed it down to two it's either a
wolf or a beaver
so you're an immigrant oh yes sir are
you happy to be here having between
capital for quite a few years
what do you tribute a to other than your
good looks
Sarkar yep Garvey maybe you could give
him a lesson
hey everybody I'm Stephen Baldwin gosh
you look fantastic
Hollywood guy usual suspects my favorite
movie proud American first of all I'm
just as George Washington assurance and
RV enthusiast uncle Steve the big boy
this is my buddy max famous financial
guru and well he's a little bit
different
last but not least my larger-than-life
an aspiring star real with all the drama
happening in our great country I'm
hitting the road to have some fun
meet everyday Americans what's America
to you our ancestors suffered the most
and see how things got so crazy I was
naked naked
hopefully start to bridge the gap this
is the great American pilgrimage
it's day number two in South Dakota and
our heroes are still riding high from
the majestic sights of Mount Rushmore
but before they get on the road Steven
wants to continue on his pilgrimage to
make America's skate again
is that gnarly or what we're done while
Stephen and Rio carve up Keystone max
heads into the woods so he can finally
get in touch with his inner spirit
animal I can feel I can smell I can
touch this is so so real it's so
beautiful take me I'm ready to go
I'm ready turns out it was a beaver now
that Max is ready it's time for our
heroes to continue on Stephen and Rio
coast back to the RV while Matt's has
awoken his inner spirit head and doing
so he has also opened the spiritual door
the consequences of this your guess is
as good as mine our heroes hit the road
and head north steven is continuing his
meticulous driving while also
appreciating having max around honestly
guys it really I got to tell you people
out there in pilgrim land it wouldn't be
the same without the Great and Powerful
Maxwell Kaiser I'm feeling it you know
when he invited me back in LA I thought
you know if I'm gonna die in a flaming
wreck I'm not rushing more who better to
do with them Stephen Vogt
now you're talking max with both hands
now on the wheels Steven and Max enter
into the Great Plains passing through
Rapid City on the way so who would you
put on my rushmore aside from the four
presidents that are on there now huh
well that's the question I was asking
myself as we were driving along I would
go with Rick Yeah right that's me fair
enough
not only because I agreed with his
politics in many ways but I just think
his faces looked so much better up there
than than others
no no he's so stoic that's the Hollywood
in here what about Jimmy Carter is a guy
he represents a very soulful American
tradition of giving he spent all of his
post-presidency building houses for the
habitat you know these are he's a mensch
he's a real great guy
where you got your Hollywood hat on
raving no you thank Jimmy Carter's not
photogenic enough to be on Mount
Rushmore where you said it not me okay
try don't say that all right I only said
that I thought President Reagan would
look nicer up there yeah you think if
Alec Baldwin ever runs for president I'm
like his Billy Carter hey so if I think
Reagan would be good yeah
are you saying you like Jimmy Carter
that's your choice no I don't think so
so you wouldn't go with Jimmy Carter now
dude what are you ready
who would I put on Mount Rushmore I'll
tell you how I climb Mount Rushmore Neil
Armstrong first man on the moon
that was America's finest moment that
was the epitome of our technological
prowess
where's my frickin American than that
Stephen and Max tell the ways to go
before their next stop on the pilgrimage
and after a morning of important matters
in Rushmore our heroes got a late start
so with the Sun setting and their
stomachs empty they decide to pull over
for dinner
and get some shut up as the Sun rises
Stephen is awoken by the sounds of a
banjo in the distance so who follows ear
and goes exploring through town Stephen
I'm Stephen as well hey 8ph nice yeah
they're pretty good too yeah
hey YUM let me ask you something I want
you've been playing the banjo well I
started out on a broomstick when I was
nine and my family took me serious about
age ten ten and a half when they bought
me a real banjo suit your tent yeah
yeah how old are you now 28 I've done a
lot of little gigs here in there all the
way from opening up for a football game
and Knoxville Tennessee it's a little
bitty bars you know for veterans rowdy
bikers moonshine right all over them
what was your favorite it was B up
dungeons name of our veteran bar they
have the best moonshine you know
190-proof
grade-a moonshine I'm thinking maybe me
and you could put our heads together and
do like great American pilgrimage
moonshine that's probably the best idea
I've ever heard I mean TV needs that
they did America needs moonshine just
kidding
can I sit here yeah if you were to go
out in the world and tell somebody hey
listen to these different sounds a bit
you most of them would relate the sound
of the banjo to America it is that part
of true like American culture you know I
came over on from Ireland
it started out an Irish banjo first
settlers came here and has living off
the farms and things like
maybe a old guy sitting on a porch
playing a banjo and women used to be a
big thing women would do to like to woo
a man would be played banjo like that
so what's America to you
a lot of place a lot of people say it's
land of the free
but I think America to me is a place
where you have a choice of freedom it's
not everybody in America chooses to be
free why are you sitting up
because a lot of people are terrified of
certain things like say not having a
shelter over their head for one so that
will continue to work jobs they
necessarily don't even like just so they
don't have to be homeless I look at
myself as home free I'm not homeless I'm
home free somebody doesn't have a home
sometimes they choose not to have them
just so they're free of that burden
seriously that's I respect how long have
you been home free about four years now
that's a roughly about four years
traveling that much you must have met
all sorts of people so from your
perspective what do you think Americans
have become so divided I'd say it's
probably a host of different things I
come across a lot of people that really
fell on hard times were you talking hard
times I think people forgetting how to
love and how to help their fellow man
you know that's gonna cause a divide
because you're not gonna understand each
other as much
and once you is an understanding your
fellow man it can develop hate
that's powerful bro well you got an
original song yeah you mind if we play
it for the folks at home sure whichever
one comes to your mind
I get me no job I got no damn doubt told
I got no damn job up and I ain't looking
no way cause I'm going down there Oh
in there Lorna oh I'm down arrow Feeny
would go there and I ain't gonna treated
that way
after being enlightened by the banjo and
a fellow Steven our heroes continue on
the pilgrimage
Stephen starts to notice the power of
some outside forces also known as the
wind
hang on puppy daddy's driving the big
rig
leave it
that's the wind now see that I just
can't believe how gorgeous this is
the colors the sky it's unbelievable max
is taking in all the sights while
Stephen is taking in Rio makes you want
to break out in song Oh Rio oh I'd love
you stay forever this is why I can't
remain free Oh
take it away Wow there it is look at
that nice railway
the Iron Horse this is what conquered
the West basically right the trains
this was the technological boom
of that era the new technology that
drove a huge speculative bubble in
markets and gave rise of course to
America's robber barons late eighteen
under it's early 1900s
and this was the technology that
decimated the native population
you know that's what kind of messed
things up here for the birds that the
Buffalo
the railway track came in the Iron Horse
Wild Bill and
Buffalo show no more Buffalo you know I
plead Buffalo Bill on TV get kind of a
lump in the throat to take the chest
city Guiche justice justice justice
pilgrimage kissing our heroes have
arrived in North Dakota
Steven is battling the forces of strong
winds along with the narrow roads of the
badlands
besides the eerily strong winds steven
is also distracted by the cuteness of
Rio de Janeiro and now they're heading
toward oncoming traffic
you're the best puppy ever oh my god
good
hey hey somebody said there was like
something about Sitting Bull on this
road on this road well it's probably by
the water any wait a minute wait a
minute wait a sec this could be it this
could be it
Oh check it out
Stephen and Max have made their way to
the Sitting Bull monument to pay their
respects
oh wow people burning stuff and
everything oh yeah this is it
Tatanka io take III attack cake okay
Tatanka are your tonkin I think is how
you say Oh Tonka in Lakota right
otherwise on a singing bowl right okay
this guy beat custard along with this
whole tribe and Crazy Horse no kid yeah
they'd be crazy he's one of the greatest
American heroes of North America all the
Americas great warrior great wisdom
great learning bank the idea is that
this is a memorial and burial ground
but it's not confirmed this is it this
is the memorial huh
I guess it just looks like something
kind of humble for the people here and I
guess it's kind of sweet a you know it
strikes me as being a bit inadequate
you know why we were just to have Mount
Rushmore the contrast between this and
Mount Rushmore couldn't be greater Matt
Rushmore is like a Cathedral of American
colonialism here's a guy who was tribal
existence with thousands of years and
this is all we have in memory give you a
couple of trash barrels and seems like
there's a you know and he's getting
maybe to get a little
more yeah spectacular spectacle more
grandiose something some show a little
more love it seems a little small well
compared to Mount Rushmore sure yeah I
guess you make a good point
kind of seems odd yeah I think this
great American right yeah well let me
see here it says a bunch of stuff about
how we kind of didn't do the right thing
right but we're trying to do that now on
a pilgrimage here's what I'm thinking
Stephen listen to me now
yeah what I've been learning on this
pilgrimage is that we are quite small in
this universe
I'm worried that we might meet a similar
fate as the native folks here what do
you mean well you know what did them in
to train the iron horse apocalypse boom
you know there could be a point where we
meet a similar fate with the emergence
of artificial intelligence the AI Swope
is coming and we could be similarly
wiped out the next great plague
artificial intelligence
quite possibly well Sitting Bull thanks
for all you've done it's been nice to
have this experience and we hope to be
an inspiration in ways that reflect your
ideas and your legacy amen
right on all right brother
thank you for the journey of the
pilgrimage thus far if I understand
quickly y'all Stacie you have to head
out for a Kaiser report things Act we
will see you down the road of the great
American pilgrimage it all right Chicago
bye sighs damn god bless you buddy all
right

heartfelt goodbye temporarily breaking
up this bromance Steven remembers he
forgot the most important part of the
pilgrimage

the memorial here to Sitting Bull and
stopping along the way trying to learn
more about you know the natives locally
here and taking Rio for a little walk
beautiful day for a ride huh yes it is
it is it's a beautiful day who around
here would be like the almost the best
person with some of the best knowledge
maybe a pub there's a lot of elders that
you can get different versions of our
history and our knowledge of it so it's
not just one person there's many writer
but chairman Dave are shambled dave is
that right yeah he's our chairman do you
be a great person to talk to you
wouldn't it yes he would would you like
to go meet him that'd be awesome
you could lead the way I'm gonna go say
hi to this well I can give you a ride

that I could give you guys a row right
now I get the RV to follow us and what
do you think ready ah what do you think
puppy I'll wrap you up in my scarf we'll
go for a ride on the motorcycle
I think that means yes
Stephen Rio and Janet maker with
okay this is still going on

Stephen Rio and Janet finally arrived
be real did you like the motorcycle ride
mister ma'am Janet thank you that was
beautiful I did your fun yeah yes I hope
you had fun sweetheart there was so much
fun what a treat you got us here safe
thank you let's get in there and say a
load of days hi Nicole David my friend
Steven Baldwin oh yeah yeah just got
blessed here ran into Janet over at the
sitting bone monument I asked her who
who do you think of it could maybe show
us around a little bit and meet some of
the locals she said she'd go see Dave I
could take you to arrive and show you
some different sights and just kind of
introduce you to the area and as I'm
doing that you'll learn more about the
people
we're taking from here Steve I got to
get back to work thanks to me guess you
know thanks for right now thanks to you
guys
so do you know much about the sick
people not too much now
dogs are like one of the most loyal
friends to our culture he's the most
loyal and Brett most compassionate there
live for us man's best friend man's best
friend so just so you know we are known
for eating dogs with even puppies the
Sioux were known for eating dogs it was
because when we sacrificed them it was
their wish it's something that their
spirit said they wanted for our people
so that we can live do you have a name
for your dog so it's just yes he has a
name this is Rio so what time should I
prepare him for dinner lunch what should
we do we won't eat meal because he has a
name as long as long as we know that
there's the sacrificial cut so to speak
he just has to watch out for all the
other is res dogs that are running wild
on who shoot puppy hmm you better watch
out for the res dog under coyotes and
everybody yeah well he's a cute little
yeah yeah who cuts his hair my boss
aka
my wife she likes to do this little
teddy bear cut with him so it's okay
with you if we uh let's go for a ride
and I could tell you more kind of like
what I just shared with you truck let's
head on out
this is what we're rolling with here on
the great American pilgrimage very
blessed
you grab that front seat watch your head
close that door somebody please here we
go I've tried this RV out guys one two
three
seat belt there we did if you haven't
seen any of this pilgrimage that's
probably a good idea
somebody grab Rio just put them on the
bed he'll lay down now that we're
rolling
what my dating seatbelt on is that's
important usually if the driver wears
the seatbelt then he's come for me to
put mine on so that's not just some kind
of an Indian custom with the winds
hopefully behind him
Stephen hits the road with Dave for a
tour of Standing Rock to gain further
insight into the history of the original
Americans next time on the great
American pilgrimage if you were to come
here last year at this time there will
be over 10,000 people they came because
we're standing up against the pipeline
the struggle to protect the drinking
water and ancestral lands from the
pipelines construction at times led to
violent confrontations if you can see
where the tower is right there that is
where the pipeline goes there's a high
chance that that can break right this is
right below my house
