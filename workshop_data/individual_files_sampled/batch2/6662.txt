LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT HIM. DOWN GOES TRUMPCARE. SO WHETHER THIS BILL IS REVIVED, WE WILL SEE BUT THE REPUBLICANS HEALTHCARE BILL APPEARED TO HAVE BIT THE DUST TODAY. LET ME EXPLAIN HOW IT WENT DOWN FOR YOU GUYS. YOU KNOW THE HOUSE PASSED THEIR VERSION OF REPEALING OBAMACARE AND REPLACE IT WITH A BILL THAT WOULD LEAVE 23 MILLION PEOPLE UNINSURED. THE HOUSE VERSION WOULD'VE TAKEN AWAY YOUR PROTECTIONS ON PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT WOULD'VE MADE PREMIUIMS FOR SENIORS MORE EXPENSIVE. IT WOULD'VE COVERED LESS OF YOUR HEALTHCARE. IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER, AND IT'S RATINGS ARE HORRIBLE. THE SENATE HAD A SIMILAR BILL. IT THREW 22 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF HEALTHCARE AND IT ALSO GOT RID OF OBAMACARE AND REPLACED IT WITH SOMETHING AWFUL. FROM THE BEGINNING OF IT ALMOST THEY NEEDED TO HOLD ALL BUT TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS. THEY ONLY HAVE 52. THEIR PLAN WAS TO GET TO 50, DO SOME OF THIS, AND SOME OF THIS. THEY CAN'T EVEN DO THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE 60 VOTES AND THEN GET MIKE PENCE TO BREAK THE TIE. THEY LOST SUSAN COLLINS IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO DRACONIAN. AND ROSS RAND PAUL BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS NOT DRACONIAN ENOUGH. HE WANTS LIBERTARIAN ISLAND WHERE EVERYONE EATS EACH OTHER. HE WAS NEVER GOING TO GO YES, IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE HARSH FOR HIM. NEEDED EVERYONE ELSE TO HOLD AND LAST NIGHT MIKE LEE AND JERRY MORAN, BOTH CONSERVATIVE CAME OUT AND SAID WE'RE WITH RAND PAUL, THIS DOESN'T TAKE ENOUGH PEOPLE OFF OF HEALTHCARE. USE THOSE EXACT WORDS BUT BASICALLY THEY SAID WE NEED MORE FREEDOM, MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH AND THIS DOESN'T DO DEVASTATE MEDICAID ENOUGH. UNBELIEVABLE, BUT GUESS, THEY ARE NO VOTES THINK GOD. NOW THEY COULD NOT PASS THE SENATE VERSION THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR WEEKS. THEN MITCH MCCONNELL CAME OUT AND SAID THESE THINGS AND THAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THEIR NEW PLANETS AND WHY THAT APPEARS TO HAVE ALSO IMMEDIATELY BUT THE DUST. AND I WILL SAY THE VOTES BEHIND IT. MCCONNELL SAID TODAY REGRETFULLY, IT IS NOW APPARENT THAT THE EFFORT TO REPEAL AND IMMEDIATELY REPLACE THE FAILURE OF OBAMA CARE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. OKAY, WE ADDED THE FIREWORKS. HUFFINGTON POST REPORTS FOR THEIR THAT HE CONTINUE TO CITIZEN IT WOULD TAKE UP AN EARLIER HOSPITAL AND VOTE FOR A REPEAL OF OBAMACARE WITH A TWO-YEAR DELAY TO PROVIDE A STABLE TRANSITION PERIOD TO A PATIENT CENTERED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. OKAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS, I DON'T KNOW, WE GET RID OF OBAMACARE BECAUSE WE TOLD OUR VOTERS WE WOULD DO THAT AND THEN WE PUNT. WHAT ARE WE REPLACING IT WITH? I DON'T KNOW. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOSE HEALTH INSURANCE UNDER THAT IS SO GIGANTIC THAT ONE ESTIMATE PUT IT AT 75% OF THE COUNTRY. THE BACKUP PLAN WAS WE JUST GET RID OF INSURANCE. PREPOSTEROUS. AGAIN, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER ALREADY TODAY THAT WILL VARIOUS MEDIA OUTLETS NOTED THAT IT WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FULL REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WOULD PASS, MCCONNELL'S MOVE LIGHTLY AMOUNTED TO A CHALLENGE TO COLLEAGUES WHO HAD SEALED REPEAL AND REPLACE PROGRAM NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH DOTS THAT ITALY TOLD YOU. BUT AS MICHAEL LEE, RAND PAUL, ALL OF THOSE GUESSING NO, I WANT TO KICK MORE PEOPLE OFF OF MEDICAID AND THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE AND IF IT'LL HAVE INSURANCE, WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE FOR THEM. BOOTSTRAPS. MCCONNELL CALLED THEIR BLUFF AND SAID OKAY, YOU WANT TO JUST REPEAL AND HAVE NO BACKUP PLAN AND MAYBE HOPEFULLY TWO YEARS LATER WE SOMEHOW, HE WOULD NEED 60 VOTES FOR THAT DOES SOMEHOW WE GET A DEMOCRATS TO AGREE WITH US TO DESTROY OBAMACARE AND REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING THAT COVERS LESS PEOPLE. THAT IS YOUR PLAN CLUSTER AS SOON AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT MIKE LEE SAID YEAH, I LIKE THAT PLAN. HE THEN SAID ALL RIGHT, NOW I WILL FOR IT. BUT THEN THEY IMMEDIATELY LOST OVER OTHER VOTES BECAUSE SHERRY MAYOR SHERRY MOORE CAPITO IN WEST VIRGINIA IS LIKE LISTEN, YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT. 3RD OF WEST VIRGINIA IS ON MEDICAID. I CANNOT REPEAL IT AND THEN GO I DON'T KNOW, A THIRD OF THE STATE HAS NO INSURANCE. THAT IS BECAUSE MEDICAID OF COURSE GOT INCREASED UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THAT IS LIKE OVER 70 PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND EVEN THOUGH THEY VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR TRUMP, THEY ACTUALLY KIND OF LOVE OBAMACARE. IF YOU THINK THAT AWAY FROM THEM, THEY WOULD BE LIKE WHEN A MEDICAL STUDENT WE JUST VOTE AGAINST HER OWN SELF INTEREST? THE GIG WOULD BE UP. THEN CAPITO AS A REPUBLICAN CAN PRETEND TO BE ON THE SIDE THAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE WHEN A MINUTE, YOU TOOK MY HEALTH INSURANCE AWAY. I'M SICK. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT WAS OUR PLAN ALL ALONG. SHE'S LIKE THAT IS TOO OBVIOUS. I CAN'T DO THAT. ROB PORTMAN COMES DOWN FROM OHIO AND SAYS I HAVE TO RECONSIDER THIS. SUSAN COLLINS IS LIKE NO, THIS IS EVEN DUMBER. I'M NOT VOTING FOR THIS. SHE IS OUT AND THEN THE CAMEL THAT BREAKS THE BACK, LISA MURKOWSKI FROM ALASKA COMES OUT AND IS LIKE NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO REPEAL IT WITH NO PLAN TO REPLACE IT. THAT IS A BIGGER DISASTER. SO IT IS GONE AND ALL THE SUDDEN THEY HAVE NO PLAN. WHEN WE GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS. RESPONDING TO THE NEWS OF THE SENATE BILL DEMISE, TRUMP ON MONDAY CALLED ON REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR AN OUTRIGHT REPEAL OBAMACARE, URGING LAWMAKERS TO START FROM A CLEAN SLATE ONE NOTING THAT HE BELIEVED DEMOCRATS WOULD JOIN ANTI- LET ME REDO THAT EXACTLY BECAUSE AS DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN. BY THE WAY, I CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU, THIS PLAN IS ALREADY DEAD. HE IS NOT FOLLOWING THE NEWS. HE TWEETED EARLY IN THE DAY TO BE FAIR. REPUBLICAN SHOULD JUST REPEAL FAILING OBAMACARE NOW AND WORK ON A NEW HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT WILL START FROM A CLEAN SLATE. DEMS WILL JOIN IN. SURE DEMOCRATS WILL JOIN IN TO HELP YOU DESTROY OBAMACARE AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. WE ARE WAITING FOR, ANY SECOND NOW THAT HE WENT ON TO COMPOUND THAT. I'VE ALWAYS SAID, LET OBAMACARE FAIL AND THEN COME TOGETHER INTO A GREAT HEALTH CARE PLAN. STAY TUNED. OKAY, NO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY TUNED AND LOOK AT HOW VICIOUS THAT IS IT. I'M GOING TO GET TO HIS STRATEGY HERE IN A SECOND BECAUSE I'M GOING TO PLAY A CLIP FROM DONALD TRUMP OF THE REASON THAT IT FAILED IS THIS. THIS IS FROM ABC NEWS WASHINGTON POST POLL I TOLD YOU ABOUT JUST YESTERDAY. ON HIS PARTY SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN ISSUE, HEALTHCARE, AMERICANS BUY A 2 TO 1 MARGIN PREFER OBAMACARE OVER THE REPUBLICAN PLAN TO REPLACE IT, 50 TO 24%. YOU KNOW THAT MEANS? THAT MEANS ALL OF YOUR LIES ABOUT HOW OBAMACARE IS FAILING, IT IS MISERABLE, IT IS TERRIBLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HATE IT IS NOT TRUE. 50% IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD OVERALL AND BETTER THAN OBAMACARE HAD BEEN DOING BEFORE PEOPLE SAW THE ALTERNATIVE. THERE LIKE WOW, THE ALTERNATIVE IS HIDEOUS. NO, 50 TO 24. DENTISTRY CANCER. BEHAVIOR PLAN. THEY HATE IT BIGLY. TRUMP IS GOING TO SAY WHO CARES. LET IT FAILED. THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR TRUMP HERE IS PEOPLE START DYING. IF HE WAS RIGHT, HE IS NOT, BUT IF USC'S LIKE WHAT THEM DYNASTIES AND THEN MAYBE THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO WHAT THEY WANT THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HELP THEM OR AMERICANS WHICH IS WHAT ARE PLAN PASSED BECAUSE AS TAX CUTS OF THE REST OUT WITH THEM PLAN WITH THE BELT IDEAS TRUMP. WE'RE DISAPPOINTED, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE AGAIN, EVEN AS A CIVILIAN FOR SEVEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT HEALTHCARE AND I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT REPEAL AND REPLACE AN OBAMACARE IS A TOTAL DISASTER AND I THINK YOU ALSO AGREE THAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME, LET OBAMACARE FAIL AND THEN EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND FIX IT AND COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN AND A PLAN THAT IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WITH MUCH LOWER PREMIUMS, COST AND MUCH BETTER PROTECTION. I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT, MY, I THINK YOU'LL AGREE FOR A LONG TIME. LET OBAMACARE FAILED I WILL BE A LOT EASIER AND I THINK WERE PROBABLY IN A POSITION WHERE WILL JUST LET OBAMACARE FAIL. WE ARE NOT GOING TO OWN IT. I'M NOT GOING TO OWN AND I CAN SAY THE REPUBLICAN IS GOING TO OWN IT. WE WILL LET OBAMACARE FAIL AND THEN THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO COME TO US AND SAY HOW DO WE FIX THE? OR HAD WE COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN. IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING THIS ISSUE YOU ARE WONDERING, IS HE A MONSTER IS A STUPID QUESTION OF THE CORRECT ANSWER IS BOTH. WHEN HE SAYS I'M GOING TO LET OBAMACARE FAIL, THEN HE WAS A YEAH, THEN YOU GUYS WILL NOT HAVE INSURANCE TYPE IS RIGHT, HE IS NOT, OBAMACARE IS NOT FAILING, WHAT IS I MEAN? IF YOU SAY PREMIUMS ARE TOO HIGH. THAT IS A FAIR AND INTERESTING ARGUMENT, PROGRESSIVES ARGUED AGAINST ADHERE WASTE CAN FIX THAT THAT YOU CAN NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES FOR MEDICARE WHICH IS WHAT YOU SAID YOU WOULD DO DURING THE CAMPAIGN THAT WE CAN PROTECT MEDICARE AND PET MEDICAID WHICH IS WHAT YOU SAID YOU DO ON THE CAMPAIGN THAT THOSE ARE THINGS DEMOCRATS WOULD IMMEDIATELY AGREE TO BUT YOU ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT. WHEN HE SAYS OBAMACARE IS FAILING, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T AGREE BECAUSE IT IS FAIRLY POPULAR. IT IS WAY MORE POPULAR THAN THE REPUBLICAN PLAN. 2ND OF ALL, IF IT WAS FAILING, THEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE, THEY CAN AFFORD AND THEIR DYING DAY IS LIKE IT, LET THEM DIE, LET IT FAIL. THAT IS MONSTROUS. NOW WAIT A MINUTE, WHEN AND IF HE WAS RIGHT AND IF IT LATER AND PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THEY STARTED DYING, THEN THEY WOULD JUST GO BACK TO THIS CLIP AND THEY WOULD SAY YOU LIKED THE IDEA OF US NOT HAVING INSURANCE. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SAID LET OBAMACARE FAIL. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO CAN PASS THE LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE IT OR PASS IT, IT'S AGAIN NEW LEGISLATION THAT YOU THOUGHT WOULD BE BETTER AND YOU CAVALIERLY TOLD US TO GO DIE. HOW STUPID ARE YOU? YOU JUST SAID THAT ABOUT 12 TIMES ON TAPE. AND THE REALITY IS, HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU. HE HAS NEVER CARED ABOUT YOU. IT WAS ALL ABOUT ME ME ME ME ME. I'M DONALD TRUMP, I'M GOING TO BE RICH AND SUCCESSFUL. I'M GOING TO HAVE POWER. SO IF OBAMACARE IS FAILING AND HENCE, YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND YOUR FAMILY SUFFERS, GREAT. AND I AM SO STUPID, I JUST SAID GREAT ON TAPE. 8 TIMES OVER. THEY DON'T HAVE A NEW PLAN. THEIR PLAN WAS ALWAYS DESTRUCTION. THEY DON'T HAVE A CONSTRUCTION PLANT THAT THE PLAN WOULD'VE TAKEN MORE PEOPLE OFF OF HEALTHCARE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE JUST SAID GO PACE OFF. 24% APPROVAL RATING FOR A PLAN IS AS MISERABLE AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE AND WHAT HAPPENED, DONALD TRUMP? I THOUGHT YOU HAD THE ART OF THE DEAL. YOU ARE A DEALMAKER. WHERE IS YOUR DEAL? I TOLD YOU GUYS DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM WITH DONALD TRUMP IS ACTUALLY HIS INCOMPETENCE. TOTALLY AND UTTERLY INCOMPETENT THAT YESTERDAY AS THE BILL IS FAILING, HE HAS NO IDEA THAT HE DID THAT WITH THE REPUBLICANS AND HE IS LIKE ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING IS GOING GOOD, RECKLESS AND IT WILL PASSES, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOPES. HEY KNUCKLEHEAD, PAUL MICHAEL HE ASIDE. PULL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OBJECTING ASIDE AND TRY TO MAKE A DEAL. HE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT BECAUSE HE IS SO STUPID. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE LESSON YOU MEANT WHEN THE REPUBLICANS, THEY SAID REMEMBER ALL THE TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH WE HAVE IN THEIR IDEAS LIKE WHAT TAX CUTS? THAT'S A DIFFERENT BILL. HE'S LIKE NO, THERE'S TAX CUTS IN THIS BUILD ON HE'S LIKE REALLY? I THINK YOU GOT THAT WRONG. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. THAT IS WHY HE WENT BANKRUPT SIX TIMES AND HE IS BASICALLY DOING THAT TO THE COUNTRY NOW. DESTROYING EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES, BUT WE ARE TO LEAVE HIM TO FUND NOTES. 1ST OF ALL WHICH IS KNOW FOR THE RECORD ONE MORE TIME. THEY FAILED. OBAMACARE LIVES. NOW? THEY WILL COME BACK, THEY ARE ZOMBIES, I KNOW THEY WILL COME BACK. THEIR $700 BILLION OF TAX CUTS AND THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE SO THEY WOULD DO TAX REFORM IN AND THEY WILL TRY TO COME BACK TO THIS BUT A SECOND WINDOW TO LEAVE YOU ON IS MIKE PENCE. AFTER THIS BUMBLING FULL GETS HIMSELF THROWN OUT OF OFFICE, THIS GUY IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT I UNDERSTAND YOU MIKE PENCE IS. JR DID A GREAT VIDEO HERE OF MIKE PENCE'S REACTION IN THAT LAST VIDEO YOU WATCH THEM TRUMP. LOOK AT THIS SAD, SAD YES-MAN. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I FULLY SUPPORT THE MAJORITY LEADER'S DECISION. NOT THAT ONE, THE OTHER ONE. OKAY, YEAH, RIGHT. ANOTHER NOT. OKAY YEAH. YOU ARE SO RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP. DON'T EVER FORGET THIS VIDEO. YEAH, I AM BEHIND YOU DONALD. EVERYTHING YOU SAY DONALD THOUGHT THAT IS A GOOD ONE. INTENTLY. YOU KNOW THEY CALL ME IN INDIANA? MIKE. OEF. ANOTHER NOD AND ANOTHER NOD. THAT IS MY DEAR LEADER. OKAY. THAT IS WHO MIKE PENCE IS. I LOOK FORWARD TO WRESTLING WITH HIM LATER.
