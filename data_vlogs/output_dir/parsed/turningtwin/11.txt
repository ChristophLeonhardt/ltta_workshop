ok so Brown one how this works is you
can inflate a booth if somebody has
actually gone through the forums and
bought a hoagie tops some butter and
so it's gonna be split into three Brown
and the fourth round is either mystery
books or steal an item which I can't
wait for that down key for that round
I'm still annoyed close
once we've compared all the rounds and
we all have a full outfit then it's up
to us to style it the best way you
possibly can and I think it can be very
interesting now obviously with round one
and rows of it it's way to get any other
hair we needed heads but that Kansas is
here the time what i'ma talk are you
going and you must take round one is the
top three two one
all right eating what you get so I got
these polar top knot I got this very
colorful top
but colors are in right now colors all
right round three all right round two
this time we are picking bottoms
hopefully to somehow match the top we
just picked three two one and
let's get glam
let's get a clown round three it's
working a little bit differently so we
have numbers in this howdy half three
accessories and whatever number we pick
out that's the order that we have to
pick the accessory for example if I go
number one so obviously we all want
another one
Makena you might end up like a number
two actually didn't want to these are
the three items accessory oh we have now
a little happy and accessory so now this
is the ultimate make-or-break round
because it's the mystery box / steel
round yeah so we are enthused about
friends yeah okay well we can pick an
item from the mystery box and we have no
idea what's in that box but you have to
pick either steel only three rings
one other two so now we are determining
the order please
oh yeah
wait we feast on what do you who's been
a people already know but when I go you
know what ladies round
I actually three he's been
because then everyone's goofing and
you've got a
I got nothing I don't know what's good
and what's bad it's stress this pressure
I have to go first
I don't know what to do okay so Oh
obviously we're holding our atoms in
here and I'm especially sorry let me
take them
what have you decided give me a sec I
don't know what to do whatever happens
completely change my doubts about you
yeah I don't even know what's gonna do
that's the beauty of this challenge
okay so Sam you have to decide maybe you
want to risk it it and you get a mystery
box
it's not actually alright Nikita I'm
stealing I'm gonna steal nothing on all
right there's a yard back it comes
through your item back I'm gonna go
mystery box
alright so Nikita has chosen a mystery
box and we have put all the leftover
items in there there's other items that
we have no idea we have never seen okay
so there's a lot of items and I decided
to see what today Nikita can pick
whatever she likes
oh you don't have to take another three
two one
playing that's a good idea very smart
because Nikita picked the mystery box
round she actually has to take it on and
run the mystery box and put an item back
so which I mean thank my team enough but
okay it is now to eternity
mystery box askew okay
so you can ask about bourbon I'm sorry
okay so these are our assets we have to
go and either cut them up in them tie
them or wear them like they are and we
will come back and show you guys
alright Nikita you're up let's get all
in hackers and in guys that was a skit
do you like my scrunchie Baker our girls
it looks like overall yeah and I like
the boots 2x to the yeah what you are
very black I'm so not soft like I did
not like you guys look like you're just
normally dress

who you actually think won the thrift
shop fashion challenge yeah so who do
