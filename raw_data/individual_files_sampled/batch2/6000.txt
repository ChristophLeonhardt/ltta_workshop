Rudy Giuliani revealing president Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for that 130 thousand dollar payment to store McDaniels in a moment I'll talk to the head of the watchdog group who says it creates brand new exposure for Trump when it comes to campaign finance laws Giuliani of course says the opposite that the payoff wasn't a campaign violation but at routine expense for Trump's lawyer the question there was the only possible violation there would be was it a campaign finance violation which usually would result in a fine by the way not this big storm troopers coming in and breaking down his apartment and breaking out his office that was money that was paid by by his lawyer the way I would do out of his law firm funds or whatever funds doesn't matter the president reimbursed that over a period of settlement I saw with me now Paul Ryan vice president of policy and litigation at the watchdog group common cause his organization first brought a complaint on the stormy Daniels payout and alleged campaign finance violations back well this is Natasha of bertrande great to have both of you with us Paul let me begin with you I want to first get your reactions to Giuliani's comments that this was not a violation of campaign finance law something that the president routinely expected from his fixer Michael Cohen to do that certainly tells me that Rudy Giuliani doesn't understand campaign finance law and how it works that's pretty bad news for president Trump that his lawyers going on national television offering up evidence of a crime having been committed by the president a criminal violation of campaign finance law and then displaying his lack of knowledge about how these campaign finance laws actually apply to his clients conduct let me read for you specifically Paul the bit from the FEC talking about disclosing loans it says in quote if any person including a relative or friend of the candidate gives or loans the candidate money for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office the funds are considered a contribution so from that specific definition would this be covered as something that would or should have been disclosed it most certainly should've been disclosed for a couple of reasons number one it was a payment for the of influence in an election that makes an expenditure under campaign finance law the Trump campaign was required to disclose that Michael Cohen also made an illegally large in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign the minute he tapped into his home equity line of credit for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars that he used to pay stormy Daniels and I think there are additional reporting violations related to the ongoing failure of the committee to report this if you want to call it a loan call it a loan if you want to call it a contribution that works to loan is within the federal definition of contribution so ongoing violations reporting violations related to the failure to report by the committee and the incremental repayments by Donald Trump to Michael calls so very quickly Paul would the statement that Giuliani made this morning on Fox News saying that you know could you imagine if this would have come out on October 15th in the heat of the election weeks before the voting day could that statement alone be considered you know evidence to back up your point that this was an in-kind contribution or a loan or whatever you want to call it in the heat of an election I certainly consider it strong evidence of the obvious that this payment was all about the election look stormy Daniels has said in legal papers filed in court in California that this was all about the election there are a lot of other the timing matters the fact that stormy Daniels was threatening to talk to the press national media right before the election the timing of the Access Hollywood tapes a couple weeks prior to this there's a lot of evidence that this payment was about the election it so Natasha to that point if Trump did in fact just find out the details of this situation about ten days ago or so does that time frame that window of the past ten days give him a justifiable cover that he did not know about any of these payments or how that payment was made or what it was for etc for starters I gotta say that it's possibly that question was to Natasha Gallagher sauce on in just a second give me a second go ahead Natasha I was just gonna say I don't think so I mean especially knowing what Trump and Cohen's relationship was like and Cohen is Trump's fixer yes but the relationship between them too between them was very very close Cohen works with Trump for over a decade it would have been very very odd if Cohen hadn't alerted the resident then candidate Trump to the fact that he was going to pay stormy Daniels $130,000 to remain quiet about an affair that they allegedly had a decade ago I mean this is not this would be totally out of character for Michael Cohen to do and of course this also speaks to whether or not what Michael Cohen did was was legal or ethical I mean keeping if what they're saying is true that he kept this entire thing from the president I mean it could Cohen be disbarred for that legal experts have spoken to have said yes he could and that's it honestly that is a perfect segue and Natasha it's like as if you were reading the questions we had prepared and this is what I want to get to which is this how in the world could a guy who works with Trump Michael Cohen his fixer not talk to him about a payment like this in fact this is what Giuliani said about the arrangement between Cohen and Trump listen I know about the specifics of it as far as I know but he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of things like this for my clients I don't burden them with every single thing that comes along busy people so does this suggest Natasha that in fact Michael Cohen was quote arranging other payments on behalf of President Trump so this was a really interesting comment and I think another slip-up by Rudy Giuliani this nothing was disclosed Cohen was not disclosed as you know a someone who was giving loans or making donations to the campaign so if he was making other payments that could be considered campaign donations and again it wasn't disclosed and this just increases the Jeopardy here I mean it was just it's very very odd that that Rudy Giuliani would come out and say that yes the stormy Daniels payment was won and then there may have been others that were related to this I mean it's not out of character for for Michael Cohen to have done this he was Trump's fixer after all but it also raises questions that perhaps Muller will want to know about which is you know as part of the Russia investigation which is well what else did Michael Cohen pay to cover up during the election hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
