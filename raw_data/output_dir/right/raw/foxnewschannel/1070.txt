STATE.

12
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,805
AT THE HEART OF ALL OF IT,

13
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:18,140
QUESTION OVER WHAT RIGHTS

14
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,308
AMERICANS HAVE WHEN THEY GET

15
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:20,242

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,917

WITHOUT ANY CHARGES.

26
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,858
NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

27
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,393
IS LOOKING TO RELEASE HIM

28
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:40,396

55
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:16,965
THE U.S. MILITARY HAD HOPED

00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:18,267

00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:23,439
THAT REQUEST WAS DENIED BY A

60
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,373
U.S. FEDERAL JUDGE.

61
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:25,507
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE

62
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,142

THEIR REQUEST WAS

68
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,151
ESSENTIALLY DENIED AND JUST

69
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,486
