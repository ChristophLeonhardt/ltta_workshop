hello I'm Alex and have a Cyberman I had
friends in college myself me and Ian we
were very close
unfortunately things change I mean we I
mean especially and he met different
people different classmates he he joined
different organizations at school I mean
people change nothing is nothing lasts
forever
as they say but what bothered me was the
feeling that Ian was avoiding us like
for example I would meet him but he
would just hug or he would just ignore
me I said I don't exist
it started off like it was doing the PE
class we had the basketball the teacher
was teaching us the basics of basketball
like shooting the ball the forms the
prepositions all those and my classmates
made fun of my FM in place or my moves
all my gestures I said I said I am NOT a
basketball player said they just called
me gay the behavior went all in line
I mean again I get messages they get
comments for many people saying that I'm
gay I'm homo and blah blah and all this
get all gundalian and treat me a lot
things between me and Ian got worse it
got physical when Ian pushed me aside
and called me Papa the time I remember
the pain insults blessing in disguise
McGee came to defend me from here he
showed me an aside and fought for me he
stood up for me when no one else would
and it meant a lot to me
the bullies got milder but they didn't
stop there however it's just fine
because as long as I know that I have
friends I have people who love me for
who I am who will stay on my side I
think that's the most important if
people are making fun of you just
because they were different you are
weird
just remember that your uniqueness
that's your strength and your difference
that what's makes you remember that
there's someone who loves
so my past booty it used to fear down
the world around me
I choose to build the better one
you
