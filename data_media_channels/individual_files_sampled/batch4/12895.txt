so Maxine Waters caused a bit of consternation when she encouraged her supporters to harass Trump cabinet officials and staff I wasn't especially consternated myself is consternated a word yeah it's it's one of those words it sounds like it isn't a word but I think it is work I wasn't especially consternated myself because I expect nothing but bile and nonsense to spew from the mouth of one Maxine Waters although this I admit was several steps beyond the normal bile that you expect from her and it was truly dangerous and this story along with or this rant of waters that along with the thing that prompted it which of course is Sarah Sanders getting kicked out of a restaurant in Virginia seems to have sparked renewed discussion about the possibility that we could be headed into a civil war in this country now I don't personally think that Sarah Sanders being interrupted in the midst of her cheese plate is the kind of thing that would normally spark a civil war it would certainly be the weirdest civil war of all time if that's what it was fought over but I do think that it's symptomatic it is just one really faint in itself insignificant symptom of something and there many other symptoms of the RNC and I don't usually say this about the RNC about really anything the RNC does but the RNC released a truly devastatingly effective ad yesterday that kind of compiles some of the dangerous rhetoric we've seen from the left recently if we roll that ad actually we roll it no we can't roll it I don't in fact I'm not talking to anyone there's nobody over there I'm just just my webcam so I can't roll and he adds for you but after this you can go on youtube and watch it yourself it is an effective ed and it all kind of shows that something something not good his is happening in America
