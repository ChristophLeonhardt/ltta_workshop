high school bully David Hogg is trying to use the last three minutes of his 15 minutes of fame to destroy conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham by staging a boycott of her sponsors the foul-mouthed teenaged enemy of the United States Constitution targeted the longtime media star and former supreme court clerk over whether Ingram should have teased him when some of his college applications were turned down oh sorry whether or not David Hogg should be teased is a very important issue for our country of course because he said if I have that hog who has called Republicans SiC efforts and has called NRA spokesman Dana lash disgusting and has accused Senator Marco Rubio of being bribed by the NRA to let children die feels that Ingram should be ruined for being impolite to him many in the media are saying that Hogg shouldn't be criticized because after all he's just a traumatized young person who can't be expected to behave or speak rationally and should therefore be invited on every TV show to discuss the Second Amendment but personally I think young hog should have to decide whether he's a damaged and confused young man who shouldn't be consulted about anything or he's the leader of a movement and therefore open to mockery and criticism because you can't be both in the real world only on CNN trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin

so here's here's the thing I want to talk about because they're really interesting the way this story was reported I went to talk first of all just in general about corruption corruption is a big big deal I lived in New York in the late 70s when it was unlivable and it was terrible and it was simply corruption it was democratic governance same as in Chicago same as in Baltimore but it's that Democrat governance that works as a machine and it becomes internally corrupt and it's all about patronage it's all about giving your friends stuff and not calling your friends to account and then I have to give credit to first Ed Koch who cleaned up Manhattan and then of course Rudy Giuliani who cleaned up the entire town but what happened was Ed Koch was a genuinely honest guy and he had some conservative aspects to him and ultimately became a lot more conservative but one of the things that happened was he was so I remember they actually tapped the mob Mafia's phone and the Mafia was talking about brought trying to bribe Ed Koch and the guy said no no no you can't you cannot touch Ed Koch and what happened was because he cleaned up Manhattan there was a huge scandal where all the other boroughs all the corrupt guys the other boroughs were exposed one of them killed himself it just was a huge thing in the 80s and that cleaned up the boroughs and then Giuliani came in and he was just incorruptible and that's how the city gets cleaned up you can't clean it up until the corruption is gone now the thing is corruption is endemic to democracies corruption is endemic to humanity and of course plenty of authoritarian governments become corrupt but it's endemic to the system of democracy because you have to do favors for people to build coalitions so it's a great opportunity for people to come in and buy your favors and to give you a lot of money and then they give you money and you say well I've got to do stuff for them and then they start to slip your money behind the scenes and basically you get owned by your coalition if you're not careful and the problem is is that freedom creates inequality right if you're free you're gonna be able to do so what you do to the best degree and I'm gonna be able to do what I do to the best degree and that means I'm going to but not be as good a basketball player as LeBron James and LeBron James is gonna be out there making a lot of money and doing all that being famous and all this and I'm gonna be sitting around in my driveway bouncing all because I can't shoot like LeBron James and I can't move like him people don't mind inequality right inequality first of all you shouldn't mind inequality because what difference does it make if the guy next has a billion dollars if you have enough money to do all the stuff you want to do you know that's what I always used to bug me about Obama although lefties it's like he has so much money who cares who cares but but people don't mind inequality if it's natural inequality right LeBron James was born with more talent than I have and I don't it inspires me and moves me to use my talent more to watch him use his spectacular talent on the court and my talent may not make the kind of money that a basketball player makes but I'm fine with that as long as it's natural inequality the problem with corruption is it takes the nature out of the inequality and it's just the guy who is in with the politician this is why leftism is so bad because it rewards who you know instead of what you know capitalism rewards what you know and what you do and what you create so when a system becomes corrupt freedom is under threat freedom is under threat in ways that even somebody like even when a politician does something that temporarily you know crosses the line of the Constitution that's a very bad thing but it doesn't endanger the Constitution the way corruption does because you know take take the the Chinese Communist revolution the so-called Republic the Kuomintang were deeply deeply corrupt and everybody knew it in all the villages they do it and when the Communists came in see ideologues a lot of times are not corrupt the Communists came in they were not corrupt why because they believed in communism they passionately passionately believed in communism ideologues tend not to be corrupt and that gave them an attraction that gave a tyranny and attraction that it wouldn't have had because the Republic was so corrupt okay so you know this is by the way true of Obama Obama was an ideologue and he was not corrupt in the sense of taking money I don't think you could bribe Barack Obama because he was an ideologue he was trying to accomplish something and that was one of the things that make his tyranny so he's you know I shouldn't call him a tyrant he was less free he's less committed to freedom than he should have been and and that made it appealing because he actually was honest in that way he was corrupt in the other way ways he was corrupt in that he did exactly what the Democrats have done to New York exactly what they've done to Chicago is he turned Washington into Chicago he turned it into this machine that rewarded his friends and punished its enemies as for instance when the IRS came after conservatives so that when you have that you undermine you undermine democracy you undermine freedom and that was the worst thing Obama did it wasn't the executive orders it wasn't even some of the you know terrible that wasn't Obamacare it was the corruption it was turning the government into a rigged system that did not that punished its enemies and did not play fair it didn't play fair and one of the worst ways is now coming out and that's why this is so important I know I know this scandal story is really important I try to keep it is really complicated I try to keep it as simple as I possibly can because I know once you're saying this guy was giving to this this guy's give me this basically basically the story to keep it as simplest was Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for Oppo research on Donald Trump what they got was a dossier from this X by Christopher Steele that was filled with Russian disinformation it was filled with information that you know Donald Trump was with prostitutes who were urinating on it on the bed which I I don't I actually do not that's it there's a sex story about Donald Trump I don't believe because I think he's a germaphobe and he was probably busy at the time getting spanked by a porn star he's got guys basically living my Google porn search he's like I'm just looking it was actually I'm joking that's just a joke but anyway it was the the steal dossier was filled with all this dubious research and it seems the Republicans are making a very very sound argument that through a lot of machinations behind the scene John Brennan going to Harry Reid Harry Reid going to the FBI and James Comey they in their eagerness to get at Donald Trump they used this dossier to get a warrant to spy on a guy who had worked for Donald Trump in a kind of ancillary wet Carter age that's corruption that is one political party using the tools of government against another political party that is deep deep corruption so yesterday if you were just glancing at the newspaper you would have seen this headline sessions rejects Republican calls for second special counsel and that was the way it was played everywhere it was played like a big victory a big victory for the Democrats against the Republicans Jeff Sessions was not going to have a special counsel to investigate this question of whether the Obama administration misused this steel dossier and spying on an American and that was the way it was all told Charles Grassley Chuck Grassley had asked for a special counsel robert Goodlatte of Virginia had asked for one and trey Gowdy of South Carolina had asked for a special counsel to investigate this in session said no it hasn't risen to that level yet although I may do it later okay and but the other part of the story the other part of the story was buried under that headline because earlier about a month ago a month ago Donald Trump had tweeted he's always picking on Jeff Sessions I really just I really wish you wouldn't do this because sessions is a good man he has a straight arrow straight shooting guy who's doing the best job he can and it's complicated you know he has to be careful to be when you're the AG you've got to be above you're like Caesar's wife you know you got to be above suspicion so Trump tweeted about a month ago why is AG Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse the FISA Court is the court the spot that gave the warrant to spy on Carter page so sessions has said that he would appoint the he would tell the inspector general directly inspector general to investigate massive FISA B's and Trump said this will take forever the IG has no prosecutorial power and he's already late with reports on Comey etc and isn't the IG and Obama guy why not use department lawyers why not use US attorneys and then in all caps disgraceful so that was trumps tweet about this well first of all the IG is an Obama guy but he's universally Michael Horowitz is universally respected the Republicans respect them too just because Obama appointed him doesn't mean he's corrupt so I think that was unfair but he says why not use Justice Department lawyers but that was the story yesterday is that is exactly what Jeff Sessions done Jeff Sessions has not only put the IG in charge of investigating this Pfizer abuse he also announced yesterday that he's got this guy John Huber the US Attorney in Utah just like Trump wanted he's got this guy leaving the investigation and and Huber is also in Abama appointee but he was reappointed by Mike Lee who was a rock-ribbed Utah conservative so he should have he should have the confidence of both parties as well so this is something that really is happening and they said it like oh he's not gonna but here's here's Jeffrey Toobin Jeffrey Toobin is CNN legal adviser you know legal commentator and the fact that he is CNN is the only adjective to know you need to know what I think of him and what I think of his opinion so here he is basically dismissing this entire idea which I think Republicans have come very close to proving dismissing this idea that there was 5z5 abuse no as far as I could tell most of the accusations against the FBI or lunatic conspiracy theories just not grounded in anything and and I think the Attorney General did an appropriate thing here giving you know giving this to the inspector general that's why we have inspector general's but I expect there will be nothing found here and I think sessions did the right thing he is asking you a Utah's top federal prosecutor John Huber to begin an investigation an internal investigation as well what do you think about that I think that's that's appropriate I mean that that's the level of inquiry deserves it doesn't deserve the whole superstructure of an Independent Counsel I mean or a Special Counsel as it's called now there is you know inspectors general do investigate the the department in which they work so there's nothing extraordinary about this and given the flimsiness of the accusations I think you know giving it to a US attorney is about the appropriate level of inquiry that the whole subject deserve so he is selling he's selling this idea that by giving it to the inspector general I mean is the guy who just got McCabe fired right this is Mike Laura's just got Andrew McCabe fired he's selling this idea that giving it to the inspector general that doesn't mean anything it's just this kind of little investigation no you know this is like the Internal Affairs guy he's gonna look at this and they've got a US attorney on this who was trusted by both parties Obama appointed him and Michael Eyrie appointed him so he's a you know he's straight obviously they feel he's a really straight arrow guy and the idea that there is nothing to see here is wrong-footed completely contradicted by the fact that the FBI has been slow marching the documents that the Congress has subpoenaed from them and not only do they slow walk them I'll talk about this more in a minute when they get there they can have a lot of important stuff cut half they redact them it you know you know it's like that old joke where they show up and is all blacked out you know and every now and again there's a word like he you know or thee or something like they're doing they they're pulling every cheap trip and now they're start they're gonna move on because sessions call them out in and said look you guys are gonna be held in contempt if you don't do this in the Congress at the same thing so Devon Nunez or none as and you knew that nobody knows it's you know I call this man's sister a must night there must be a way different other than Devon Nunez pointing it out that this is a classic case every time somebody attacks Donald Trump by some kind of weird magic maybe Trump sold his soul to the devil I don't know but he's got some weird magic where every time people attack him it blows up in their face and Nunez says that's what's happening now the left has continued to say that this is Watergate and you know Trump's gonna be in Peach they've continued that well now this is effectively boomeranged on them and you know you have at least I think half of the American people now know that the other party the Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree the intelligence services you know by using the foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and target the opposition campaign is totally unacceptable and that's what happened here and so people are beginning to learn the truth so I am happy that Bob Goodlatte subpoena these 1.2 million documents but I said this earlier in the week we need those documents like yesterday yesterday we needed those documents and and what I think now the difference where we were from a few months ago because of the obstruction because of the cover-up the pressure that the American people are now putting on Congress by making everybody aware of this asking their Congressman why is it the Department of Justice can Stonewall Congress for this long I believe that Bob Goodlatte subpoena is going to be in force I think we're gonna get all the documents and if we don't then we should move quickly to contempt and then we should move to impeachment and you know this is this is serious stuff because this corruption as I said this eats away at freedom it eats away at the foundations of government without your seen it and I know all these investigations I mean I make fun of them all the time because they're investigating the people who are investigating the investigators at this point but it it is important that they clean this out when they talk about draining the swamp this is what they're talking about and it also means that we on our side have to hold Donald Trump to the same kinds of standards I don't care ice truly don't care who Donald Trump sleep slept with or who he sleeps with but I do intensely care that he does not allow this kind of corruption that Obama allowed to take over the government and so far it seems that he hasn't he's actually stalked the government with really really good people and if you don't think that the that Nunez or Nene Azure 9s or whatever the hell his name is if you don't think that he's right that they are moving trying everything they can to win the power to impeach President Trump you are not paying attention I mean this thing that the the Democrats the left and the dead the Democrats on the far left are virtually indistinguishable at this point that the Democrats in the far left are so mobilized for the midterms they're so ready to go and that conservatives and Republicans look like they're kind of being a little bit drab you know and do we like Trump and do we really like Kimmy tweets he's rude you know this isn't crazy stuff because they here's let's see we have representative Eric's ass wall well of California's this liberal guy was talking to Wolf Blitzer listen to the way he's talking he is like they are drew ruling to get their hands on the levers of power so they can impeach Trump when it really is Obama they should go back and put Obama back in the White House where they can impeach him you know posthumously at this point but listen to this guy when you say congressman the president will be fired soon what exactly are you suggesting well I hope it's at the ballot box this midterm election and then in 2020 by the voters but I think by his own conduct he's inviting articles of impeachment before the House Judiciary Committee if he were to fire Moeller or if Moeller were to refer any charges then and of course there are the pending criminal investigations that are taking place my point wolf is that there's going to be a reckoning for this president my hope for the country is that it comes at the ballot box by the voters well do you support impeachment I support investigations that are thorough in right now we saw the house investigation shut down I think the only way we can get a thorough investigation is that the Democrats win the Congress and an investigation should first tell the American people what we're going to do to harden the ballot boxes and then hold the president accountable whether it's on hiring his family making money off the office any work that he did with the Russians during the campaign but we should be I think more faithful to the facts and the truth than he is and not just jump to conclusions okay so you don't want to jump to conclusions listen to this talk about Jeffrey Toobin on CNN saying or nothing to see here crazy lunatic conspiracy theories remember the FBI agent Peters struck and his love girls Lisa Paige right and there in the FBI and they're sending these texts back and forth how much they hate Trump and we need an emergency back-up plan in case he gets elected and we don't quite know what it what they're saying to each other at one point it turned out that they knew the judge the FISA judge Fiske judge Rudolph Contreras who was the he was the judge in the case against Michael Flynn the guy who's been forced basically to maneuvered into pleading guilty to lying to the FBI even though it doesn't seem he lied about anything very important or anything that he did wrong right so had these texts going back and forth right and Struck's says here's that Rudy root up by the way he recused himself after this he recused himself from the case but he says Rudy is on the the FISA Court the Fisk Court did you know that just two point in two months ago and this is Lisa page sorry Linda Linda page isn't yeah I always forget with it Lisa page but never mind doesn't Nunez it's Nunez but it's a faked page says it says Rudy is on the court did you know that and struck says I did know it I need to get together with him and he said he'd he'd gotten on a month or two ago at a graduation party we were both at and struck a page then began discussing planning a dinner party so they could meet with the judge without anybody knowing that that's why they were meeting with the judge to discuss the case so if they had a dinner party then no one would know that this was case and then the judge wouldn't have to recuse himself right they're conspiring in these texts the texts show up at Congress and this part of the conversation is blacked out it's blacked out how did they find out about it they read about it in the Federalist a source sent through actual unredacted things to the Federalist and now the DOJ is the Congress is looking at the Federalist the information that they're keeping out of the you know of the information they're turning over to Congress if they're if there ain't corruption here there sure is something that stinks and it matters it met I don't it's not about going back and hunting down Obama post case it's not about sending Obama to jail don't get your fantasies going Obama's not going anywhere he's not going to jail it is about cleaning out these departments so that we can believe in our institutions again and have the kind of freedom that does produce a LeBron James but we can feel that it's being done fairly and it really is important to keep going after this corruption all right let us talk about we're gonna stay on the air just because we love you and it's Friday it's Good Friday and we figure you know as a religious act we're gonna stay on the air and let you listen to us talk about faith and reason but please go to the Daily wire calm and subscribe and then you'll never be cast into the exterior darkness where there is great wailing gnashing of teeth and no left uh steer tumblers but that's in the Bible Professor Brian Clayton co-authored this book two wings integrating faith and reason with Douglas Crees professor Clayton is the director of the faith and reason Institute and associate professor of philosophy at Gonzaga University where he teaches courses on faith and reason and one of my favorite authors CS Lewis another author I like very much Walker Percy and j.r.r tolkien whom everyone likes professor thank you for coming on I appreciate it well it's a pleasure to be here thank you for inviting me to wings integrating faith and reason why did you feel that you should write this book now well the book developed out of a course that we had team taught Doug and I had team talk with the former president of the university father Robert chase Spitzer of the Society of Jesus and it really just sort of brings together everything we have been doing over the last 18 or so years and puts it in one place for students so it really originates in the course so I'm reading this book now by Steven Pinker called enlightenment now and he and his basic argument I mean to be a little unfair to him to condense his argument is look how great things are everybody lives so much longer everybody's healthier but it's got food less disease and it's all because of the Enlightenment and the people in the Enlightenment yes some of them were deists but that was just because they couldn't quite let go of this superstition but if we could just let it'sit's the people who want to drag us back to faith in God people want to drag us back to religion who are getting in the way of this wonderful wonderful thing that has happened to us in the last 300 years what's your argument against that well I think that there are people who have what some some philosophers have called the Enlightenment agenda where they were in the Enlightenment very much attacking religion right and so the those who have inherited that agenda sort of continue the attack and I take Pinker to be part of that and with what that involves in part is denying the actual history of the rise of modern science and the rise of the the rule of law and so forth much of which can be traced back to the medieval period and to Christian thinkers in particular I mean it was in it was in the Latin West and their Latin Christian West that modern science had has its origins and going back as far as 12th and 13th centuries so I think it takes it's a very narrow view of the history of our civilization to think that the Enlightenment suddenly was this major break with what had gone before so that's part of the response and then on the other side it seems to me that there are people who have kind of bought into yet well-meaning people have bought into the idea that there's an opposition between faith and reason or between science and faith and and their response has been to become what we call in the book feed a istic and so they sort of abandon reason so they give it over to the Enlightenment and to their to those who in here at the Enlightenment agenda and so you wind up with the Enlightenment having kind of a hyper rationalist approach to things and you have the fetus having hyper faith approach to things and then it's some of the fee deist in particular who do the kinds of things that presumably Pinker is objecting to okay but if one has an integration of faith and reason if one understands the history and the ideas and the arguments in particular then one sees that there's no opposition between all the wonderful things that he likes and the modern contemporary world and faith the traditional faith you know I'm really happy to hear you talking about this so clearly because this seems absolutely true to me but it also seems important to explain in ways that people can understand so we have this now fairly good mechanistic understanding of the world we understand that when you pull this lever this thing flies out and we'd understand the laws of thermodynamics and so on why do we why does guy still remain a reasonable thing to believe I I would actually go back to st. Thomas Aquinas I'm not Roman Catholic my colleague Doug creases I teach at a Roman Catholic University but I think st. Thomas who had a great deal of respect for the new sciences that we're developing offers a way of pointing out what gets left out of that sort of mechanistic picture that yeah you can we can think in terms of the mechanisms that operate at the material level but why for example is there order there doesn't have to be order right and the the things that are ordered say the motions of the planets and so forth we say oh that's due to the laws of nature well the laws of nature describe what happens they don't cause what happens right so we need some account some kind of causal account as to why things are as they are I agree with st. Thomas the probably the clearest way of getting this is getting at this is what he calls the the first way or what's known as the first way which is in order to understand the observed fact that things around us change some kind of sometimes called the unmoved mover argument but it's a unchanged changer is the way to think about it we observe the change happens okay why is that but what's involved in change well anything that changes has the potential to change but that potential has to be actualized by something well then that means you have to have an actual Iser and then the question is well does that actualize or have any potentiality that needs to be actualized in order for it to operate as an actual place guy all right and so you can't have then an infinite chain of actualize errs that require actualization eventually you have to get to something that actualizes without itself being actualized as a matter of fact it can't be it can't be actualized it's unnatural izybelle it's just fully actual and Thomas says and this is what we call God so if we're in order to understand sort of the basic phenomena that we see in the world around us this is Thomas's argument there are certain conditions that have to be met one of those conditions is you need a fully actual actual Iser and this is what we call God that's what creation is and and it's not it's not like a finger knocking over a domino it's more like a hand spinning a rope right I mean it's actually the thing was happening in them it's hell yes it's happening right now croatian is not something that happened in the past is happening right now it's more like the musician singing a song and so the the musician the singer and the song right they're going on at the same time together and what what's misleading is that that's the process that happens in time and of course God isn't in time can't be in time right so but this is when I look around the world right now I'm seeing creation the creation it's the one act that God is doing right right the singer in the song great metaphor I know now they it's not original yeah it sounds it sounded like it had some tradition but now what about this new science and this is a thing that Pinker pushes very hard a lot of the 8th new atheist push this very hard the idea that eventually they're going to find and they're finding now that our decisions that we think our freewill are actually happening at the quantum level and we only become aware of them after they're already made by material things I do you worry at all that there that anything in the new brain science and anything in these new amazing.look looks at the human at the human machine do you worry at all that they're going to erase the idea of the individual freed of individual freedom I don't but you know several different grounds but just just one for example if one looks at if one looks at what's going on inside the body when I'm thinking about something one doesn't see thinking right you see neurons fire and you see blood flowing and particular ways other systems in the body reacting and so forth but you don't see a thought you don't see if you don't see the act of thinking itself so thinking seems to be which would be involved saying deciding exercising will that doesn't seem to be the same kind of thing that's being talked about what I'm talking about neurons firing or I'm talking about neural chemicals or whatever and it's not clear at all how you're supposed to relate to the two you may get a correlation oh well whenever somebody is thinking these there are these neurons firing and there's brain moving and these are blood moving in these ways but that's not the same thing as the thinking and how do you get from neurons firing to thinking or deciding or exercising my will I don't it's a conceptual problem I just don't see you know how you ever bridge the game it's only it always confuses me why when they say that why they don't posit that the thinking causes the brain flashes rather than the other way around I mean that something is has certainly because it's outside of the material world so they can't imagine now let what about the vexed question of evolution I am a believer in evolution but I've never understood why anybody should think it's random or how you would even know it was random if you're inside the system how you know it's like an ant knowing that his anthill is know what's happening outside of his anthill I mean I write it does evolution bother you in terms of biblical teaching no not at all and of course speaking from a Catholic University the Catholic tradition has a long history of reflecting on this and not having a problem with the idea that part of the way in which God creates or part of his creation that he's creating is to set in set in motion or caused to be things that have causal properties that behave in regular ways they have causal powers and so it makes it it's perfectly open to God to bring about living things through processes that he has established cause of existing things that have causal powers that enable them to to undergo a process of you know natural selection or whatever and you wind up with things that are alive or you wind up with different kinds of species etc so I mean certainly a broad outline I don't think there's a problem and as far as the biblical account itself if one goes back to someone like San Agustin Agustin wrote a work on the literal interpretation of Genesis and he says whatever's going on when it talks about the six days of creation and day of rest it can't mean days like we mean days right because of when the Sun is created for one thing it's it's conveying something else right it's it's attempting it's it's communicating that all of creation is dependent at all times upon the creator for its existence right right and that's that's really the point and then of course then you have the chapters devoted to the creation of humans and it's making a different point there's talking about the special dignity that human beings have but all of that is compatible with the scientific theory of descent with modification by means of natural selection I suppose there's a kind of a basic question that's in I'm not sure that Pinker has ever said this but it's kind of inherent in Pinker certainly inherent to some of these thinkers that it if you can if I can feed people with science if I can make people live longer if I can even this this guy who wrote this book sapiens basically believed soon people will live forever and though why do I need God why do I need faith well I mean first of all it's an acknowledgement of reality scientists know it's reality and if it is the case as I think it is and we have good arguments to show this that the whole created order is dependent upon God say the unmoved mover of God and the the uncaused cause the Intel and cause of all else that exist and then one goes on to reflect on well what is this reality that we're talking about what is this create a reality that we're talking about well it's completely different than anything else that we know and yet and so God is utterly transcendent in that way but also fully imminent right present to every part of my body and all moments at which I exist nothing's closer to me than God is then you begin to ask well what's my relationship with this reality and that's where the religious question will he comes in me but what's the proper response to this reality and theists have have always responded the proper response is worship okay right I guess I'm running out of time so I but I really do want to ask you this this final question I read a lot of books about people worrying about the state of the West and we're even about our tradition collapsing and again and again I've seen this now and it may be five or six books the writer usually a very proficient intellectual very accomplished intellectual will say you know yes it all depends on Christianity Christianity is the bottom block in the Jenga tower but I just can't believe I can't believe I can pretend I'm a Christian I can support Christian tradition but I can't believe and I usually feel that what they're stumbling on is the miraculous the idea you know I always joke that I believe a Jewish carpenter rose from the dead and I'm not I've never even seen a Jewish carpenter but you know I I sympathize I sympathize with this I mean we live in this world of wonders do you need the miraculous do you need to believe in the miracle of the Resurrection for one thing and in some of the other miracles to have true faith yes yeah I mean if Christ be not risen our faith is in vain right right but again if we take the idea the classful understanding of God that theists have the idea of miracles doesn't look like somebody standing out by the machines take that mechanical metaphor and reaching a screwdriver and then trying to make adjustments so it's not like some kind of intervention instead the miracles are themselves part of the one act of creation it's woven into the whole story as as we experience it in time of God creating so it if we look at it as a kind of intervention and how do we justify you know why would God and their being why should would it be reasonable to believe that God is intervening I think that's the wrong way to think about it it's it's more like oh the singer was singing this song and we thought it was going to go in this direction but no kind of varied right we had a variation on the theme here and yeah and that does that does happen and I mean we see it in life and then you find the the reasonable explanation afterward and you explain it backwards yeah yes really interesting Bryan Clayton the co-author with Douglas Crees of two wings integrating faith and reason very clear as you speak very clearly you write very clearly and it's much appreciated I hope you have a great Easter and thank you very much for coming on I appreciate you have a happy Easter yourself thanks thank you very much that I I'm always happy to hear this explains it so well it's it's obvious that he's given it a lot of thought and the book like I said I've only been been able I got the book very very light and I've only been able to dip into it and read parts of it but it's incredibly clear and when I went what I did as I often do when I'm testing something as I went to the parts that I know about and found it really responsible well not just well reasoned but also well read and intelligent two wings integrating faith and reasons so it's good Friday we will end our week of Holy Week meanderings the Holy Week mutterings of of my own that are just things that I am have been thinking about a good friday of course is the day of the crucifixion then people always say why do they call it good it is not because I have an extra show some people say they it's a misinterpretation of the word God it was God's Friday other people say it's good because of course it's part of the act of salvation even though it was so much suffering or Jesus and such a tragedy for the people around him it was actually good because it worked out man's salvation the question that I always hear and I I I think that the news media which is kind of anti roulette a kind anti religious it's like ravening Li anti religious is always saying why did Jesus die why did Jesus have to die and the idea behind this is that there's something uncivilized that someone should have to sacrifice something for God to appease God this isn't that what we used to do when we threw virgins into volcanoes why does this have to happen again and of course the argument that this is God sacrificing himself to end essentially all other sacrifices is the one sacrifice ever and it needed never really makes it into the magazines but but still there's still something in explanations that I find not untrue what the explanation the normal expression is not untrue but sometimes I find it non immediate you know the usual explanation is Adam sinned man fell now Jesus has to pay for that sin with his death that sin brought death into the world Jesus takes the sin on himself become sin and dies for us and now we have the opportunity to live eternally and I sort of think like well yeah I believe that but what what what good does it do me right this minute you know and I Drive theologies just so you know if your mind driving you a little crazy theologians when they talk to me get really driven crazy because they'll talk and they'll say brilliant brilliant things and I'll go yeah yeah but what am I supposed to do you know what is it what does that mean for me do I you know do I eat fish on Fridays or what you know like how does that help oh and so and so I you know as I have thought about it I just this is not to negate what I just said but it just to put it in practical terms because I think it has to do with politics and the way we discuss politics is is the fact that history is inescapable it's not so much for me as I look at it that like Adams sinned and therefore there's some kind of poison that flows through our blood I don't believe that that's true at all what I believe is that once mankind sort of started taking on the responsibility for morality himself and sort of believe that he was the the operator he was by the unmoved mover history turned in a certain way and this is a real thing you know that all the injustice has ever happened all the murders all the wars all the terrible things that if that men and women have done to one another throughout history they have brought us to this point everything good we have we stand we stand not only on the shoulders of giants we stand on the bodies of victims when the left talks about the mistreatment of the Indians no one would say that the Indians were not mistreated and and now you have a home that's on the land that they owned nobody would say that slavery was a good thing you know my argument when guys like Tana he see Coates say well slavery created an injustice that injustice is still here in the form of less wealth for black people so there ought to be reparations paid my argument is that injustice bends the arc of history and that's just more injustice taking money away from people who didn't hold slaves to give it to people who weren't slaves is simply more injustice he thinks well it's different on justice was gonna bend the arc I history back but it's not is it going to keep bending that art in injustice and that injustice never goes away you cannot fix history you can only live in history and living in history is living in sin living in history is living in sin because you are benefiting from the deaths of a million people always always every one of us not just white people not just you know people in America everybody we are all living in a world that was made through incredible terror rape Pyne rape and and killing all those things we cannot step out and the world is on that track forever when Jesus came into the world he brought with him you don't don't even forget about forget about the miraculous nature of Jesus just think of him as someone whose mind was so in conjunction with God just just for a moment think of it this way that that he embodied the logic and the logos of God the love of God the creativity of God that overflowing love that becomes creativity the forgiveness of God all those things that he embodied he brought into the world when you look at the Good Friday story that crucifixion story you can point to villains people always try to point to villains but when you really look at it he's killed by history he's killed by the world the world works like a perfect machine to murder that logos the truth the way that you're supposed to live the life that you're supposed to have the world works to murder that and if you haven't noticed that that remains as true today in a world that is much more peaceful a world that's much more prosperous word world that's much more healthy the truth will still get you killed the truth and decency and love and forgiveness will still leave you behind will still get you killed the resurrection is the statement by God it is the statement by God that yes history is on that train track it is on that train track of sin here's a door here is a door turn your your ship in a different way it is the question of whether you are born into into a world of sin or you are given a new soul to start the world again and the answer to those questions is yes they're both true they're both true at once when you follow the logos when you turn toward the logos when you turn toward the love when you turn towards the truth and the life you're going to suffer in the world you are going to take some hits in the world I'd let that's why I always laugh when people say how can I stand up to my history professor and tell him the truth and what they really mean is how can I do it without suffering you can't if you speak the truth you know you are gonna take some hits if you live in us in a way that follows what you know to be the truth of God you are gonna take some hits you are gonna take up a cross you're gonna take up a cross if you follow Jesus but that gives you a fresh life when they talk about being free from sin that's what they mean that they are you're traveling against away from that train track it doesn't mean that you're suddenly a good person we all know you're not a good person I'm not a good person we know that it has nothing to do with that it's the direction in which you're traveling and I can tell you that all the wisdom in the world all the joy in the world all the true success that the happiness in the world is in that direction it is in that direction is every time you step in that direction you will get joy and freedom every time you get on the train track you will be carried away into that world of sin I can tell you that for a fact that is a fact and so that is the the reason the reason in some ways that Jesus had to die maybe had to fulfill what CS Lewis called some deep magic in the world but he really had to die because history had to kill him in order to continue to be the history that it is and it's his death and his resurrection or invitation to you and me to step out of that history to step out into this new world that is as I can tell you a world of just it's just makes it an abundant life a life that you are pleased to be a part of with all its suffering with all its sin with all its corruption it is a joy all the same to be walking in the right direction so on that note have a wonderful Easter and if you don't celebrate Easter celebrate Easter a much nicer Easter
