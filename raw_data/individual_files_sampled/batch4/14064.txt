small story in the National Post but an interesting one it's about a scoop we broke here the rabble about a year ago the headline in the post is little concern from politicians as Environment Canada buys ultimate vehicles for testing as in the Environment Department was buying luxury vehicles like Porsches on the public dime we have that story a year ago it was our scoop rebel readers loved it and the rest of the media is just catching up now that happens a lot you know mainly on issues that embarrassed the Liberals or run counter the official narrative on things like global warming or mass Muslim migration or free speech controversial things like that it's why we've grown as a company we tell you the other side of the story if the mainstream media were more balanced you really wouldn't need the rebel would you so I can't complain too much about this it's a shame that the media industry is so left-wing but it's also why we're successful here but Lewis it's really revealing rebel media has made a habit of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory but never more so than when it ran a story last fall about the federal Environment Department purchasing a number of expensive cars the story was a genuine scoop that resurfaced on Twitter this week and is causing indigestion in the upper reaches of the Trudeau government unquote oh did we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory we had the scoop last year isn't that what journalists call winning but later down in his story Jon Iverson who was writing this for the post he wrote this he said the mainstream media was put off the story because of its source as a result no one asked the question what possible reason did a government department have for spending a hundred and twelve thousand dollars on a new Tesla 92708 ease sixty six thousand five hundred dollars on a Lexus Hybrid 67 thousand two hundred on a used Porsche and sixty three thousand dollars on a second-hand Porsche Cayenne so three things here first of all if you want the news that contradicts the mainstream narrative you've got to come to the rabble we have scoops or exclusives almost every day even if they're little sometimes they're very big most of them are just stories right out there in plain sight that the mainstream media just chooses to ignore because they're liberal and sometimes life isn't but the second point is don't you think it's weird the John Iverson and the National Post thinks that we failed it's weird because his test is the rest of the media didn't follow us and didn't give us an attaboy and a pat on the back isn't that saying a lot more about him than about us I really don't care what other media say or do about us or our stories other than if they actually gave conservatives a fair shake we might be out of business here at the rebel but what an insight into how he thinks he's doing his writing for the approval and satisfaction of his media party peers he's writing to please his buddies in the parliamentary press gallery he's not writing for his readers he's writing for the approval of Ottawa insiders that's how he measures success that's why he says we failed because we didn't win his approval our readers loved it but the third point is the most shocking of all John Iverson and the National Post acknowledged that what we had was real news he doesn't like our particular angle on it that's fine but we broke real news about liberals wasting tax dollars on fancy cars and he admits he positively says that him and other media knowingly and deliberately choose not to cover stories because we hear the rabble cover them first and they know that what we do is news but they can't control their own emotions they hate us so much that they would literally choose to keep real news away from their own viewers rather than to do something that could be possibly interpreted in any way as approving of us they put their own emotions about us ahead of their own news judgments ahead of their service to their own viewers they admit that that my friends is why post media is losing thousands of readers and tens of millions of dollars you just can't trust the mainstream media for the rebel dog media I'm Angela van you can watch the rebel today or read about it six months from now in the mainstream media click like and subscribe to get it from here first you
