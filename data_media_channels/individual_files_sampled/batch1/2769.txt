okay so the first question comes from SC trojan he says do you genuinely think that we're going to have a v-shaped recovery um you know I really don't know if it's going to be v-shaped or what people really mean by be shaped I mean it really depends on how steep of a ve or you're expecting I think it's pretty obvious we already had a recovery I mean I a lot of things have recovered but I think really the more more relevant question is you know are there some industries that will be doing better in the future regardless so maybe it'll be a weak recovery but you know a company like Coke in 5-10 years or you know do you think they'll still be a growing business and are they cheap now so i think i think yeah i think it's it's kind of a it's difficult for anyone to know really how you know what you know how steep the recovery will be but it's important to know that I you know I do believe that we've passed you know the worst point okay a second question from mick lassen he says do you agree that much of China's recent boom has resulted in a housing bubble in the large cities I think yeah for sure for sure and I think one big reason is that for a lot of people in China they actually don't have many options for investment so really housing real estate is one of really the most you know you have to think in terms of their history even the banking system maybe wasn't always dependable so the most dependable thing to have is really land and property and now the obviously now stocks or another option but I think yeah historically that's sort of really one of their few options and so they're all going into it and obviously stimulative policies in China are stimulating that and in a place like Hong Kong then you also have you know ultra-low interest rates so another question do you think that China will be able to sustain its growth I think it's I mean China's going to grow over for sure in a long term I think that's so so i think yes it'll sustain it the most likely scenario is that yeah they keep growing rapidly they might have some violence slow down you know maybe this year or in a few years but still the long-term path I mean is for growth it's it's it's it just wouldn't make sense for for so many people that have such a lower center of living to not sort of be able to use all the technologies and innovations that we have in developed countries and do sort of a like it's basically tech transfer to develop its own country so so I think yeah i mean the growth path is for sure it is that it's a matter of you know has it gone too fast most recently and you know will there be you know some you know pretty sharp downturn in the near term another question from gym is it true that ethanol can end global warming concerns in 10 years you know I think this question I mean my global warming concerns I've already ended so so I think that's not really relevant sir another question from sir lorenz if the oil price would be determined by a simple supply demand mechanism would it be higher or lower than fifty dollars I think I'm going to go on a limb here I'm going to say it would be lower the reason being is that you know you have OPEC so so OPEC is purposely restricting the amount of oil that that exists basically on the market at any time right now OPEC actually the its surplus capacity is actually I think it's not like a multi-year high right now so I think for sure obviously if you didn't have a giant you know group of Nations restricting the amount of oil out there oil price would be far lower and I'll go out on a limb and say that be well below fifty dollars another question from GP is it time to sell yet so what I'm guessing stocks you know I made this thing to top I think it all depends on the stock obviously the markets come a long way but I think it depends in the industry i would say i would say an interesting place to look and we actually talked about this yesterday is actually look at rather than fully selling stocks actually taking output protection which essentially buying put options to protect your stocks you know i think for some names that might make sense another question from Sir Lorenz yes what's the best place to party in Bangkok I think it really depends out what you're looking for there's there's quite a few places i would say if if you are in town there and you want like a sort of a really nice place there's something called the state tower where you can basically it's a huge open-air bar on the 60th floor of this huge tower it's quite nice if you're looking for something just like sort of a local and just nuts i would say you want to go to this place called RCA it's a giant it's a giant strip of clubs with music blasting in the streets and yeah thousands of people it's pretty fun another question about Thailand what's the cost of living in Bangkok it really depends how you want to live you can live really cheap you can also live at a pretty high standard of living but I would say overall you have about it's about half the cost of the u.s. yeah you can you can live quite well you it's easy to have a nice condo swimming pool you know maid services nice food weekend trips to islands and you can do that on basically a normal salary have you traded or done market related work yeah I mean I personally been investing on money for quite some time now I've worked both on the buy and sell side so I've worked at a buy-side portfolio manager I've I've worked with a multi-strategy hedge fund called Riley capital partners I also worked with macquarie in case you know them in Thailand and I've worked with the city investment research in both Thailand and Hong Kong do you have any political philosophy so to speak yeah um I think I'm generally very I guess people would say I mean I like I like to have economic freedoms and countries so I i generally lean towards anything that allows individuals and individual groups or corporations that have the freedom to pursue their own economic interests long as you don't obviously infringe on other people's rights at the same time though I have to admit I'm a bit nuanced where I'm not like some ultra libertarian I actually do believe in having some sort of social safety net because I do think there are people who just fall into bad times and bad luck and those people actually I think it's more productive in a long term to kind of catch those people and help them sort of rehabilitate themselves into the economy rather than just let them you know crash and burn so I'm a bit nuanced there but I would say I lean towards a sort of having them the liberal economy finally from Don flamenco do you think being openly biased is the future of journalism yes I do I think it's a whole different situation now there's tons of information out there if you just want straight data it's on the web it's everywhere I think if there's no opinion or analysis then it's just that it's just data if you want actual value on you know on your information I think there should be opinion and analysis because that's that's a perspective it really means everything so that's it I hopefully you know I'll see you next time and thanks a lot for watching
