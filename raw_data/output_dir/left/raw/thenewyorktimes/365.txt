1
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,740
The industry as a whole is not
as diverse as I would like it to be.

2
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,550
It's a work in progress.

3
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,340
There's so much change going on
right now.

4
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,520
It's uncomfortable and it can be scary
but I think that's healthy.

5
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,600
We had everybody in our casting
and it was like mind blowing

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,680
but it was so cool it's like OK,
this feels like today.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,470
I'm always attracted to people who
have great personalities.

8
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,689
You know something is alive
behind their eyes,

9
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,559
and you know they've got
something to express.

10
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,089
We want the models to actually speak
and tell something about themselves

11
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:00,710
or their truths or their goals,
their dreams,

12
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,390
people that inspire them,
so we really want to hear from them.

13
00:01:05,679 --> 00:00:00,000
We're seeing so much variety now.
I think there's beauty in everyone.
