a couple in central New York have decided to go to court in order to evict their 30 year old son they have attempted to get rid of him on several occasions and it hasn't worked so they apparently have to go to the Onondaga County Supreme Court in order to get a you know a judge to agree to kick him out to evict him now in a series of letters filed with the court Christina and mark those are the individuals the couple offered their son life advice they told him to get rid of his broken card offered him money to help him find a new place to live so they're willing to pay him to leave like we will help you fix your car we will help you find a job we will give you some money to get you started but please leave and he just refuses to do so so they look the eviction process actually takes some time it takes a couple months and you have to keep sending and notifying the person you're trying to evict about what's going on and how much time they have left so I want to give you a few snippets of the letters that this couple had sent to their son one example is from February of this year they write Michael after a discussion with your mother we have decided that you must leave this house immediately you have 14 days to vacate you will not be allowed to return we will take whatever actions are necessary to enforce this decision another example is Michael here's $1100 from us to you so you can find a place to stay another example Michael seriously get out yes another example so the other things you have that have any significant value examples include stereo some tools this is especially true friend you weapons you may have you need the money and will have no place for the stuff another example it's snippet from a letter they sent him was there are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you get one you have to work so I love this story I love every part of it first of all I had never heard of evicting your own son it's just not a story I'm I guess this happened before I just never come across it before and then I thought oh my god that's true what if you've got a family member in your house who will not leave and I guess you have to go through a formal legal eviction process and these letters are not just written to him like hey Michael pretty please no their legal letters and they're written to the court to evict them okay and and and then I'm amused by the son who by the way is it's inconceivable that he's not hi 90% of the time anyway like the amount of video games that guy plays is indescribable I know nothing about him it's just to be clear okay I'm just guessing and nothing wrong with being high I've just say so but I'm most amused by him because he's like bartleby the scrivener he's like I would prefer not to yeah he doesn't respond to anything he's just like whatevs yeah they're like no seriously you're 30 dude you got to go he's like no right no but we sent you a legal letter no no nope but you got to get a job I would prefer not to know what do you do with a guy like that yeah the funny thing is I have this feeling that it would be my parents dream if I was still living at home at 30 oh I thought you were gonna say to evict you okay Anna seriously leave get out you're in you're in the sunken place leave right now okay anyway so we'll have to see I think at the end of this process they literally have to bring authorities to take him out of the house cuz he no longer has a legal right to live there yeah man that's cold when you got to do it to your own son but it appears he had it coming you should look into work even with a poor history work like you even Oh Bob like you the conversation they must had at the kitchen table like we raised the bum didn't we yeah it's such a risk to be a parent it's such a risk you never know what you're gonna get like when you got a 30 year old son hanging on to your leg and he just won't let go all right sad day for everybody two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
