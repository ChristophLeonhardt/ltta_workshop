there's all these people are supposed to be camped out there living there so I'm like I want to see it with my own eyes right so I got up early and I drove there and I just followed Bernie Mellie and I just put in my GPS Kinder Morgan and I call this and I just came across like there's like maybe two to three trailers a bunch of tents an outhouse and that's basically a kind of looked I don't look like you know like Occupy Wall Street kind of did or occupy Edmonton those that was kind of I really call them transit people kind of hone in on the place and camp on and live and then I was just blown away that this group of people who really should just go get jobs are holding holding up a multi-billion dollar project see to our country and I couldn't was like I was expecting like a lot of people with it was just a bunch of people hunkered down in less than less than wonderful conditions right you know what I think just looking at it while you described it I realized that there was a there was a one-day protest on the weekend but this is like you say a permanent encampment you mentioned occupy Edmonton we had occupied Anto out here yeah that's exactly what it looks like semi temporary facilities I saw a porta potti there I saw a big tent that looks like it had a stove in him so this I'm so if I understand there was sort of a one-day have hundreds of people out and then this is the permanent hard core people you'd have to be a professional protestor to live in this kind of squalor by the way it doesn't look very environmentalist to me how many people do the antes claim are here because if it's like Occupy Wall Street they claim there's hundreds of people there but there's really only a handful of people pretending it's a large number well I think what happens is it varies but a lot of it what is I think when they want the press group there if you recall but I'm sure you recall when you did something on that chiii suspense and when they need when the cameras are there want to show force I think they come out of everywhere and show up but the ones can't be out there it's like five six maybe seven they're the ones living there yeah and it's just for it's just for optics and they do it a minute to speak about the protesters they I was the first time I was on hand to watch something all those processors were either busting paid to be there they were flying them in from the United States they came in on ferries I mean think the amount of fossil fuels that is used the protest fossil fuel blows my mind that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
