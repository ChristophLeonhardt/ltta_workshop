Ofsted Chief Amanda Spearman has claimed that white working-class students lack the aspiration and drive of migrant communities so while Ofsted is claiming that they are not biased against schools from deprived communities the Ofsted boss Amanda Spearman has recently said that white children from white poor working-class backgrounds lack the aspiration and drive seen in migrant communities and we know that this is an old claim this is an old claim by the far-left that the English community is lazy we don't have the same aspiration that don't have the same Drive and that we need immigrants to do the things that we don't want to do Spillman's the Chief Inspector of schools and she recently said specifically many local working-class communities have felt the full brunt of economic dislocation in recent years and perhaps as a result can lack the aspiration and drive seen in many migrant communities but she also told the festival of Education recently that Ofsted wasn't biased against the white working-class well really there's multiple stories I think show otherwise to remember in 2014 when a primary school in Lincolnshire was marked down by Ofsted by inspectors for not having enough Asian and black children as if diversity dictates quality of learning in 2013 the Ofsted chief at the time so Michael Wilshaw said that England's schools were failing white working-class children and in 2016 remember this when a nursery was penalized by Ofsted for not being diverse enough these are the constant attacks against white working-class communities that tell them you're not good enough you're not imagine imagine the damage you do to children I okay pull it this way actually imagine you had a a class full of black kids and these inspectors came along and told the parents and told the kids while sorry you're too black there's too many of you in this class imagine what that does to children and make no mistake the kids at these schools hear about this the kids at the school hear about it they hear at it from the parents from the newspapers from the school then hear about it being told that you're too white if the white working-class community specifically children are not as aspirational as migrant communities do you think maybe it's got something to the fact to do with the fact that they're always being put down maybe I mean it seems obvious doesn't it but this is what happens when diversity and equality and all that nonsense is valued above quality education it's it's valued more than the real learning experience at schools and Ofsted even has its own equality and diversity guidelines and approaches and its own goals and all all this stuff that's imposed because of legislation to be fair but there are questions as well about whether Ofsted even understands the needs of schools in white working-class areas tes reported in 2016 the Education Policy Institute highlighted how schools with more disadvantaged pupils were less likely to be judged good or outstanding while schools with low disadvantaged and high prior attainment were much more likely to be rated highly the EPI found that secondary schools with no more than 5% of pupils eligible for free school meals were more than three times as likely to be rated outstanding as schools in which at least 23% qualified for free school meals its conclusion was damning these findings raise questions about whether the inspection system is fully equitable to schools with challenging intakes consider this fact also in many of these are working-class and impoverished areas not necessarily even just white but in many of these areas schools are teaching multiple languages within one classroom because not everybody there speaks English or at least don't speak English as their first language what you think happens in these schools were they're teaching in multiple languages the standard of learning the standard of teaching goes down and there was a story here that the more than 300 languages spoken in British schools today with many english-speaking pupils becoming a minority in hundreds of classrooms across the country is it not obvious when this happens the standard of learning not only goes down but we realized that offset isn't equipped to deal with schools like this offset is that out there you know rating the the the higher performing schools as higher-performing because they're in middle-class areas there are let's be honest mom the mom middle-class the school is the more white it's probably going to be it's actually the white traditional white English towns that have been transformed over the last however many years there are becoming more deprived there's a couple of reasons for that some towns it's still a majority English sort of school but these towns have still been affected by the the economic crash and not just that but mass emigration even from European countries this affected towns like where I'm from economically but then there are other towns that have been affected by mass emigration from all over the world where schools are teaching in multiple languages and kids don't know what's going on Ofsted isn't equipped to we've had to even begin looking at these schools and in fact the schools themselves aren't even equipped so it's not just Ofsted this failing kids it's the schools as well The Telegraph further reported on a daily Express investigation of the Department of Education Statistics and they said the overall number of pupils in state-funded schools in England is projected to increase by 13 percent to roughly 8.2 million as a result of a baby boom and emigration in one school 342 of the 360 pupils say Punjabi is their first language while just six are recorded as speaking English the report said this is the real failing of school kids displacing children from their traditional communities not considering the needs of impoverished schools and then denying that that's what they're doing when the chief inspector for Ofsted says that the white working-class lacked the aspiration and drive of migrant community she's not showing concern for the working class she's showing her contempt for the working class Ofsted consistently fails white working-class communities while favouring multiculturalism and diversity to be fair that's happening because of the government and because of legislation but regardless it's still happening schools are focusing on equality legislation and instead of quality teaching and Ofsted's not taking into account the damaging effects of mass migration on the working-class communities families have been broken young boys driven to crime and communities transformed in the matter of a generation or so Ofsted is not fit for purpose it's time they stopped targeting and demonizing schools for being too white and focusing on a quality teaching experience for all instead if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team be sure to download
