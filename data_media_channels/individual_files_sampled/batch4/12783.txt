it took me three years to finally admit that I was an alcoholic so I was a very high-functioning alcoholic most people didn't even know I was plowed all the time and and so that that's not what an alcoholic is an alcoholic is somebody who's lost all their money and and their you know a wino in the streets it's not what an alcoholic is but I and every day I would get up and I'd look at myself in the mirror and I would say you're pathetic you said this time yesterday that you wouldn't drink today and what did you do I know I know I got not today not today sometime in the day I found a very reasonable excuse to start drinking and doing drugs so I did next day say the same thing in America got so bad that I couldn't look at myself in the mirror anymore every time I would go into the bathroom any place if there was a mirror I either didn't use the sink or I opened the mirror so I couldn't see myself my daughter came down my two daughters had breakfast with me and I was having blackouts and you know it's not you know in the movies they make that funny and charming oh did we do that no it's not funny and charming you know your your body is on an islet Oak Island shut everything else down or it's gonna die you know I mean and so I was having blackouts which will freak you out and my kids came down for breakfast one morning and they were sitting there and they said dad Palaces story of inky blinky and stinky again and that was a story of three little mice that go to the island of cheese that I just made up every night and and I realized not only could I not remember the story I don't remember even putting them to bed I don't remember being with them at all and I sat there in such shame and I thought what are you doing and I lied to my kids and I said I remember the story but do you remember the story and as I fought back the tears over breakfast as they were telling me the story all I'm thinking is you gotta stop and so I I went to AAA and I was in the basement of this church in Connecticut I lived in a nice neighborhood and none of the people looked like alcoholics you know they're all successful looking there's this old lady that was sitting right in front of me she had a sweater set and pearls and you know Selma diamond is no okay she was a great comedy writer in television years ago and early radio but she was hysterical and she you remember Night Court yes okay she was the bailiff never the woman that taught me what he is that woman sounded like Selma diamond okay and and she's this beautiful old woman in a sweater set in pearls and I stand up and I said hi my name is Glenn and I think I don't know if I'm an alcoholic and they're really kind of laughed and somebody said what why why do you feel that way I mean you're here pretty good indication and I said well because I died you don't look like Alcoholics without even turning around she said oh honey we are all drunks in this room that one comment gave me permission that you can still be out of control in your life and not be in the gutter
