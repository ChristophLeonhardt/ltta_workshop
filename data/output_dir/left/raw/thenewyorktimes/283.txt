1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,260
Video games with a goal
to kill, often with a firearm,

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,600
like Call of Duty: WWII —

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,950
“I need morphine” —

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,210
Destiny 2

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,890
and Battlefield,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,020
are among America’s
most popular entertainment.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,660
And politicians
have been quick to say

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,940
that the violence
on screen

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,170
contributes to
violence in real life,

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,900
such as mass school shootings.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,660
“Congress should fund
research into the effects

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,880
that violent video games
have on young minds.”

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,310
“Violent video games
have encouraged the killing

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,031
of innocent people for sport.”

15
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:35,530
“I’m hearing more
and more people say

16
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,920
the level of violence
on video games

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,220
is really shaping
young people’s thoughts.”

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,010
There’s just one problem with that.

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,610
Back in the 1990s,
people were worried

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:55,050
about games like Duke Nukem,
Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,910
Over the years, these
games have become

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,190
more lifelike, with
better graphics,

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,640
more detail
and more violence.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,990
And some of the gunmen
who have terrorized schools

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,330
have been known to play
these kind of games.

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,190
The Columbine shooters played
the then-controversial game Doom,

27
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,660
even building their own
customized levels.

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,790
The Virginia Tech gunman
played similar video games.

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,700
And the neighbor
of Nikolas Cruz,

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,570
the accused Parkland
shooting suspect,

31
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,200
told The Miami Herald
that Cruz may have played

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,260
violent video games
for up to 15 hours a day.

33
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,270
While some studies may have
found correlations

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,860
between playing
violent video games

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,790
and violent behavior,

36
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,280
they have not been proven
to cause actual crime.

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,820
Some studies even
suggest the opposite.

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,120
“We find no evidence
of an increase in crime

39
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,820
associated with video games
and perhaps a decrease.”

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,080
“Unexpectedly,

41
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,060
many of the results
were suggestive

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,340
of a decrease in violent
crime in response

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,110
to violent video games.

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,210
Some psychiatrists
warn of the dangers

45
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,410
of focusing solely on video games.

46
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,470
“To look at violent video games,

47
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,520
in my opinion,
is a red herring.

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,720
It’s not going to lead to
anything helpful in regards

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,370
to gun violence.”

50
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,400
The argument has even been
rejected by the Supreme Court.

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,280
In 2011, it ruled that California
cannot ban the sale

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,090
of violent video games
to children

53
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,890
on the grounds that they
cause real world violence.

54
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,750
But the narrative has an appeal.

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,000
It’s a simple
explanation in a debate

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that has become
increasingly caustic.
