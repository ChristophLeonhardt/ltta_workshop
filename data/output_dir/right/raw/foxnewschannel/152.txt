FIFTH?

86
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:40,097
WHY, THE WORD IS TWO THINGS, HE

IS HIDING SOMETHING NUMBER ONE,

88
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,067
OR NUMBER TWO HE IS LOOKING TO

00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,502
PLAY OUT THE STRING, THE HOUSE

90
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,070
WILL FLIP AND THE INVESTIGATION

91
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:47,905
WILL STOP?

THE FIRST ISSUE, HE HAS TO HAVE

95
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,847
A GOOD-FAITH BASIS DOING IT,

96
00:02:56,848 --> 00:02:57,848
APPARENTLY HIS LAWYERS WILL LET

97
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,883

98
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:00,284
BASIS.

99
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:01,919
THE BIG ISSUE, WHETHER HE TOLD

100
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,886
THE TRUTH ABOUT TIMING OF

101
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,421

104
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:09,526
UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.

105
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,095
TURNS OUT HE MET WITH OHR LOOKS

106
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:13,363
LIKE BEFORE THE ELECTION.

107
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,532

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THE MIDDLE

110
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:20,337
OF THE ELECTION, IN AUGUST OF

111
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:20,637
2016.

112
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,472
HE TRIED TO COVER THAT UP IT

113
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:24,174
LOOKS LIKE TO CONGRESS AND

114
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:26,043
THAT'S WHY HE IS FACING SOME

115
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:29,146
CONCERNS ABOUT A PERJURY

116
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:29,546
PROSECUTION.

117
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,682
