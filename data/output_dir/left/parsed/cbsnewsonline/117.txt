>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM WHERE 
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS IS 
GIVING A BRIEFING. 
>> JUDGE CAVANAUGH STANDS READY 
TO MEET WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH 
PARTIES. 
AS YOU KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES 
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE 
PARTICIPATING IN A EVENT AND WE 
ARE EXCITED TO HOLD THE 2018 
MADE IN AMERICA PRODUCTS 
SHOWCASE HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
THE PRESIDENT IS COMMITTED TO 
POLICIES THAT ENSURE MORE 
PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN AMERICA. 
TODAY WE WILL SEE ITEMS LIKE 
INDUSTRIES IN COLORADO, CAMPERS 
MADE BY A NEW YORK CORPORATION 
IN INDIANA AND F150 TRUCK MADE 
BY THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY IN 
MICHIGAN AND BASEBALL BATS MADE 
BY DWP BATS IN PENNSYLVANIA. 
A PERSONAL FAVORITE RANGER 
BOATS FROM ARKANSAS IS ALSO 
HERE. 
THE PRESIDENT CELEBRATES EVERY 
STATES EFFORTS AND COMMITMENT 
TO AMERICAN-MADE PRODUCTS. 
HE IS HONORED TO HAVE THE 
COMPANY'S HERE TODAY. 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU 
JOIN US AT THAT EVENT. 
FOR NOW WE WILL JUMP INTO 
QUESTIONS. 
>>IS THE PRESIDENT CONSIDERING 
A INTEL REQUEST TO DECLASSIFY 
KEY SECTIONS OF THE RECORDS 
WITH RESPECT TO THE FISA 
DOCUMENT RELEASE? 
WILL HE DO THAT BEFORE THE 
HOUSE BEFORE IT GOES INTO 
RECESS? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS PURPOSELY 
REMAINED UNINVOLVED IN THIS 
PROCESS. 
HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HE 
WANTS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
TO BE FULLY TRANSPARENT WITH 
THESE REQUESTS FROM CONGRESS 
AND HE WILL CONTINUE AT THIS 
POINT TO REMAIN UNINVOLVED. 
HOWEVER, HE SEES MORE AND MORE 
EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THIS IS 
PROVING FURTHER AND FURTHER TO 
BE A TOTAL WITCHHUNT 
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT WAS 
BASED ON A FALSE AND UNVERIFIED 
AND DISCREDITED DOSSIER. 
>> WE SAW THE PRESENT IS TWEET 
ON IRAN LAST NIGHT. 
WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO USE SUCH 
STRONG LANGUAGE? 
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN PRETTY STRONG SINCE DAY 
ONE IN HIS LANGUAGE TOWARDS 
IRAN. 
HE WAS RESPONDING TO COMMENTS 
MADE FROM THEM AND HE WILL 
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE SAFETY 
AND THE SECURITY OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>> WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO HAVE 
DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT OF 
IRAN? 
>> I WILL NOT GET INTO 
SPECIFICS AND NOT WITH THE 
PRESS. 
THAT IS A DETERMINATION ON WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT THINKS THAT LOOKS 
LIKE. 
THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND THE FOCUS 
OF THE PRESIDENT IS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE KEEP NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND 
THAT WE FOCUS ON THE PROTECTION 
OF AMERICA. 
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED 
YESTERDAY THAT RUSSIA'S 
ELECTION INTERFERENCE WAS -- 
LAST WEEK HE SAID HE HAD FULL 
FAITH IN THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES. 
DOES HE BELIEVE THE 
INTERFERENCE WAS -- OR DOES HE 
HAVE FAITH IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES WHO HAVE PROVED 
DEFINITIVELY THE OTHER WAY? 
>> AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 
MANY TIMES AND STATED OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN AS A NUMBER OF OTHER 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, WE 
MAINTAIN THAT RUSSIA INTERFERED 
IN THE ELECTIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT, HOWEVER, VERY 
MUCH SO AND HAS REPEATEDLY, AS 
AGAIN AS THE REST OF US, HIS 
CAMPAIGN COLLUDING IN THAT 
PROCESS IS A TOTAL HOAX AND WE 
HOLD STRONG TO THAT. 
>> -- HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT IS 
A HOAX. 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS REFERENCING 
THE COMPONENT. 
HE DOES HAVE FAITH IN THE 
INTELLIGENCE THAT SUGGEST THAT 
RUSSIA WAS INVOLVED. IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT THE SAME 
INFORMATION CONCLUDES THAT IT 
HAD NO IMPACT ON THE ELECTION 
AND THAT THE PRESIDENT, AGAIN, 
WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT THAT THERE 
WAS NO COLLUSION. 
>> THE PRESIDENT FORCEFULLY 
SPOKE OUT AGAINST IRAN AND HE 
FORCEFULLY SPOKE OUT AGAINST -- 
AND HE WILL SPOKE THAT'S LIKE 
SPEAK OUT AGAINST ANY THREAT 
UNITED STATES. 
RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IS A THREAT 
TO OUR DEMOCRACY. 
WHY WILL HE NOT DENOUNCE THAT? 
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
INCREDIBLY TOUGH ON RUSSIA. 
HE HAS BROUGHT IT UP DIRECTLY 
TO HIM IN PERSON EVERY SINGLE 
TIME THAT THEY HAVE MET. 
HE HAS PUT UNPRECEDENTED 
SANCTIONS AND HAS BEEN 
EXTREMELY TOUGH ON RUSSIA 
ACROSS A NUMBER OF FRONTS WHICH 
WE HAVE ADDRESS. 
FRANKLY, I AM NOT SURE WHY THAT 
IS SO HARD FOR THE MEDIA TO 
WRITE ABOUT. 
WE HAVE REPEATED IT TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN. 
THE POLICY THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS BEEN SINCE THE DAY ONE HAS 
BEEN EXTREMELY TOUGH ON RUSSIA, 
PROBABLY MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER 
COUNTRY. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
SENATOR RAND PAUL TODAY MADE A 
STRONG ATTEMPT TO -- THE 
CREDIBILITY OF FORMER CIA 
DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN SAYING 
THAT HE USED, I QUOTE, 
MONETIZING HIS SECURITY 
CLEARANCE AND THAT IT SHOULD BE 
REMOVED. HE EVEN CALLED ON THE 
PRESIDENT TO DO THIS. 
WILL THE PRESIDENT CONSIDER 
SENATOR PAUL'S SUGGESTION AND 
CALL FOR THE REMOVAL OF FORMER 
DIRECTOR BRENNAN SECURITY 
CLEARANCE? 
>> NOT ONLY IS THE PRESIDENT 
LOOKING TO TAKE AWAY BRENNAN 
SECURITY CLEARANCE, HE IS ALSO 
LOOKING INTO THE CLEARANCES OF 
COMEY, KLAPPER, KAYDEN, RICE 
AND McCABE. 
THE PRESIDENT IS EXPLORING THE 
MECHANISMS TO REMOVE SECURITY 
CLEARANCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
POLITICIZED AND IN SOME CASES 
MONETIZE THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
SECURITY CLEARANCES MAKING 
BASELESS ACCUSATIONS OF 
IMPROPER CONTACT WITH RUSSIA OR 
BEING INFLUENCED BY RUSSIA 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT IS 
EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE AND THE 
FACT THAT PEOPLE WITH SECURITY 
CLEARANCES ARE MAKING THESE 
BASELESS CHARGES PROVIDES 
INAPPROPRIATE LEGITIMACY TO 
ACCUSATIONS WITH ZERO EVIDENCE. 
>> A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION TO 
STEVE. 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT PULLED OUT 
OF THE JCP AWAY HE DID NOT 
REVEAL AN ALTERNATE PLAN TO 
ADDRESS IRAN'S NUCLEAR 
AMBITION. 
HE SEEMED TO BANK ON SANCTIONS 
TO GET THEM BACK TO THE TABLE. 
IS THAT STILL HIS PLAN BE? 
>>AS WE HAVE SAID, THE 
PRESIDENT'S NUMBER ONE GOAL IS 
TO MAKE SURE THAT IRAN DOES NOT 
GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. 
WE HAVE SIMILAR SHARED 
INTERESTS WITH OUR EUROPEAN 
ALLIES. 
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS 
WITH THEM. 
>> MY QUESTION ABOUT RUSSIA IS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUES TO 
AIR HIS GRIEVANCES ABOUT THE 
COVERAGE OF THIS MEETING WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
>> YOU GUYS CONTINUE TO 
EXCESSIVELY COVER IT. 
>>WE CAN'T REALLY. 
IT HAS BEEN SEVEN DAYS AND WE 
HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY DETAILS 
ABOUT AGREEMENTS THAT WERE 
REACHED WHETHER FORMALLY OR 
VERBALLY. 
BY THE WAY -- 
>>THE ONLY AGREEMENT THAT WAS 
MADE IS THAT THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY TEAMS FROM BOTH UNITED 
STATES AND RUSSIA WOULD 
CONTINUE AT A WORKING LEVEL. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON PLANS TO HAVE A FOLLOW-
UP WITH HIS COUNTERPART WITH 
RUSSIA NEXT MONTH IN ADDITION 
TO MEETINGS WITH OTHER EUROPEAN 
ALLIES TO FURTHER THOSE 
DISCUSSIONS. 
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED WHEN WE 
HAVE DETAILS. 
>> SARAH, DOES THE PRESIDENT 
PLAN ON ORDERING TO MOVE ANY 
CARRIERS OR ADDITIONAL MILITARY 
RESOURCES TO THE REGION SHOULD 
IRAN CONTINUE TO POSE A THREAT? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING 
SPECIFIC ON THAT. 
>> SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO 
YESTERDAY TALKED A LOT ABOUT 
CORRUPTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSES IN IRAN. 
WHY IS THE ADMINISTRATION 
ZEROING IN ON IRAN WHEN A 
NUMBER OF OTHER STATES ARE 
GUILTY OF TRANSGRESSIONS 
INCLUDING RUSSIA WHICH WE ARE 
WARMING UP TO? 
>> WE HAVE HAD TOUGH 
CONVERSATIONS WITH RUSSIA, WE 
HAVE BEEN TOUGH ON THEM WITH 
OUR POLICY. 
AS I STATED THIS MORNING WE CAN 
BE TOUGH ON MORE THAN ONE 
COUNTRY AT A TIME AND THAT IS 
WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THE 
THRESHOLD THE PRESIDENT HAS FOR 
TAKING AWAY SECURITY CLEARANCE? 
IS IT HIS POSITION THAT ANY 
FORMAL OBAMA OFFICIAL WHO HAS 
CLEARANCE AND MAKES STATEMENTS 
ABOUT HIM HAVE THEIR CLEARANCE 
REVOKED? 
>>AS OF RIGHT NOW WE ARE 
EXPORTING THE MECHANISM ON THE 
SPECIFIC NAMES. 
I WILL KEEP YOU POSTED. 
>> THE LANGUAGE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT USED IN THE TWEET 
THAT HE SENT OUT LAST NIGHT WAS 
VERY SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE HE 
USED LAST AUGUST IN NEW JERSEY 
WHEN HE SPOKE OF FIRE AND FURY 
BEING RAINED DOWN ON NORTH 
KOREA. 
THAT LED TO A ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 
KIM JONG UN. 
IS THE PRESIDENT OPEN TO 
DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN PERHAPS 
MEETING ONE-ON-ONE? 
>> I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH 
THE PACIFIC'S BETH SPECIFICS OF 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING 
AT. 
THE GOAL IS TO STOP IRAN FROM 
GETTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND WE 
WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED. 
>>> REGARDING JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
THERE IS ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR 
WHO STATED HE IS UNDECIDED, 
RAND PAUL IN PARTICULAR SAYS I 
AM UNDECIDED I AM CONCERNED 
ABOUT HIS POSITION ON PRIVACY 
AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. 
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING 
RAND PAUL ONCE THIS VOTE FOR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH GOES? 
>> WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT SENATOR 
PAUL WILL DO THE RIGHT THING 
AND VOTE FOR THIS HIGHLY 
QUALIFIED NOMINEE. 
>> FLIPPING AROUND JOHN'S 
QUESTION ABOUT IRAN. 
CONSIDERING THE COMMENTS THAT 
WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENTS 
TWEET, AMBASSADOR BOLDEN 
STATEMENT WHICH HE POINTED OUT 
SECRETARY POMPEO'S SPEECH LAST 
NIGHT, WHAT IS STOPPING THE 
ADMINISTRATION FROM OPENLY 
ADVOCATING REGIME CHANGE IN 
IRAN? 
>> AGAIN OUR FOCUS IS ON 
STOPPING IRAN FROM HAVING 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT IS WHAT 
OUR PRIORITY IS. 
IF WE HAVE FURTHER 
ANNOUNCEMENTS I WILL LET YOU 
KNOW. 
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO PUSH AN ADVOCATE FOR THAT. 
>>REGARDING ONE OF THE STORIES 
THAT BROKE ON FRIDAY, HOW DID 
THE PRESIDENT FEEL WHEN HE 
FOUND OUT THAT HIS LONGTIME 
LAWYER HAD RECORDED HIM? 
>>THE PRESIDENT MAINTAINS THAT 
HE HAS DONE NOTHING RUN -- 
WRONG ON THE SPECIFIC TOPIC. 
>>DOES HE STILL DENIED THAT HE 
HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN 
NAMED KAREN McDOUGAL? 
>> ONCE AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT 
MAINTAINS THAT HE HAS DONE 
NOTHING WRONG. 
I WILL REFER YOU TO RUDY 
GIULIANI FOR ALL QUESTIONS ON 
THAT. 
>> FIRST ON THE STATEMENT YOU 
MADE ABOUT BRENNAN AND THE 
SECURITY CLEARANCE, ARE YOU 
CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL ACTIONS 
AGAINST BRENNAN AND THE OTHER 
NAMES THAT YOU READ OFF IN 
ADDITION TO REVOKING THE 
SECURITY CLEARANCE? 
IS THERE ANOTHER ACTION? 
>> NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF. 
TO GO BACK REAL QUICK TO THE 
RUSH INVESTIGATION. 
THE APPLICATION ON CARTER PAGE 
STATES HE IS A RUSSIA AGENT 
INVOLVED IN CLANDESTINE 
ACTIVITIES, GIVEN THAT THE 
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO SAY 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION BETWEEN 
HIS CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA, IS HE 
CONCERNED OR DOES HE NOT 
BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT THAT 
CARTER PAGE WAS A RUSSIA AGENT? 
>>I THINK WE HAVE SPOKEN 
EXTENSIVELY WHAT OUR POSITION 
IS ON THIS AND WE HAVE NO 
CHANGES. 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS THREATENING 
TO PUNISH BRENNAN AND COMEY AND 
KLAPPER FOR SAYING THINGS ABOUT 
HIM THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE IS 
THAT PRESIDENTIAL? 
>>THE PRESIDENT IS EXPLORING 
THESE MECHANISMS TO REMOVE 
SECURITY CLEARANCE BECAUSE THEY 
POLITICIZE AND IN SOME CASES 
MONETIZE THEIR PUBLIC SERVICE 
AND SECURITY CLEARANCES AND 
MAKING BASELESS ACCUSATIONS OF 
THE PROPER CONTACT WITH RUSSIA 
ARE BEING INFLUENCED BY RUSSIA 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND IT IS 
EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE. 
THE PRESIDENT CONTENDS TO THE 
FACT THAT PEOPLE WITH SECURITY 
CLEARANCE ARE MAKING THESE 
BASELESS CHARGES PROVIDES 
INAPPROPRIATE LEGITIMACY TO 
ACCUSATIONS WITH ZERO EVIDENCE. 
WHEN WE HAVE FURTHER UPDATES I 
WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
>>-- AND HE WANTS TO PUNISH THEM
. 
>>NO. 
I THINK YOU ARE CREATING YOUR 
OWN STORY. 
THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT LIKE THE 
FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE 
POLITICIZING AGENCIES AND 
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE 
SPECIFICALLY MEANT TO NOT BE 
POLITICAL AND NOT MEANT TO BE 
MONETIZED OFFICE SECURITY 
CLEARANCE. 
>> TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, IS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT DOING 
EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID THE 
PRESIDENT DOES NOT WANT PEOPLE 
DOING POLITICIZING MATTERS BY 
GOING AFTER HIS POLITICAL 
ENEMIES? 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS NOT MAKING 
BASELESS ACCUSATIONS OF 
IMPROPER CONTACT WITH A FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENT AND ACCUSING THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
OF TREASONOUS ACTIVITY WHEN YOU 
HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF 
SECURITY CLEARANCE WHEN YOU ARE 
THE PERSON THAT HOLDS THE 
NATION'S DEEPEST AND MOST 
SACRED SECRET AT YOUR HANDS AND 
YOU GO OUT AND YOU MAKE FALSE 
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
HE THINKS THAT THAT IS 
SOMETHING TO BE VERY CONCERNED 
WITH AND WE ARE EXPLORING WHAT 
THE OPTIONS ARE. 
>> SORRY, I HAVE TO KEEP MOVING.
I HAVE ABOUT TWO MORE QUESTIONS 
LEFT. 
>>THE PRESIDENT MESSAGE TO PAUL 
MANAFORT THAT THE HAVE ONE? 
>> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. 
>> CAITLIN GORE HAD. 
>>WHEN WILL HE MAKE THE 
DECISION ON THE SECURITY 
CLEARANCES? 
>>WHEN WE HAVE AN UPDATE WE 
WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
>> MY QUESTION, HAS THE 
PRESIDENT -- SINCE THEY HAVE 
NOT BRIEFED REPORTERS ON WHAT 
WENT DOWN DURING THE TWO HOUR 
MEETING -- 
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE A 
NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS AND WE PUT 
OUT QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION 
FOLLOWING THAT MEETING. 
>>HAS THE PRESIDENT BRIEFED THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, 
SECRETARY OF STATE, DIRECTOROF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE 
DEFENSE SECRETARY ON WHAT WENT 
ON BETWEEN HIM AND PRESIDENT 
PUTIN? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS MET AND 
SPOKEN WITH ALL OF THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS SINCE HIS MEETING. 
>> IS HE RELYING SOLELY ON HIS 
OWN MEMORY TO TELL THEM WHAT 
HAPPENED DURING THE TWO HOUR 
MEETING? 
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS MET AND 
CONSULTED WITH ALL OF HIS 
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND WE 
FEEL CONFIDENT. 
>> CAITLIN, I AM NOT GOING INTO 
THE SPECIFIC DETAILS WITH HOW 
THE PRESIDENT INTERACT EVERY 
SINGLE TIME WITH HIS NATIONAL 
SECURITY TEAM. 
>> BUT TO SIT DOWN WITH THE 
RUSSIA PRESIDENT -- 
>>IT IS NOT A RARITY IT IS A 
NORMAL PRACTICE FOR TWO LEADERS 
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH 
EACH OTHER. 
DAVID, GO AHEAD. 
>>WHAT ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA 
AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. ARE 
THERE SECURITY CLEARANCES ON 
THE LIST? 
>> I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY PLANS 
FOR THAT AT THIS POINT. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WITH 
SOMETHING OF A LIGHTNING ROUND 
PRESS BRIEFING AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
SHE CONFIRMED TO THE PRESENT -- 
THAT THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT
RUSSIA INTERFERED WITH THE 
ELECTION BUT HE WANTS TO 
UNDERLINE THE EFFECT THAT IT 
HAD NO IMPACT ON THE RESULTS 
AND THERE WAS NO COORDINATION 
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND HIS CAMPAIGN.
THE HEADLINE THAT WILL COME OUT 
OF THIS PRESS BRIEFING IS PLANS 
OR AT LEAST AN EXPLORATION OF 
THIS WHITE HOUSE REVOKING THE 
SECURITY CLEARANCES OF SOME OF 
THE TOP OFFICIALS IN THE PRIOR 
ADMINISTRATION, JOHN BRENNAN, 
JAMES COMEY, JAMES KLAPPER, WE 
ARE TALKING FORMER CIA 
DIRECTORS, FBI DIRECTORS, 
DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE. 
HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID TODAY 
BECAUSE THEY POLITICIZE AND 
MONETIZE THEIR SECURITY 
CLEARANCE AND LEGITIMIZED FALSE 
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE CURRENT 
PRESIDENT AND HIS CAMPAIGN 
CONNECTION TO RUSSIA. 
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS EXPLORING 
REVOKING THEIR SECURITY 
CLEARANCES. 
WE WILL HAVE MORE THE NEWS OF 
THE TODAY AFTER A SHORT BREAK. 
THERE
