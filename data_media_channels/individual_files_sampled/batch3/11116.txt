Syrian pro-government forces are expected to help Kurdish militia defend at the city of Afrin that's according to syrian state media it follows an alleged deal between Damascus and the Kurds under the agreement pro-assad troops will help Kurdish fighters repel turkeys offensive in the region this footage filmed by a repla video news agency on Saturday shows what appears to be the construction of a temporary military base in Afrin Arty's police fear has more on how turkey has reacted to the potential alliance between the Syrian government and the Kurdish groups in the coming hours it is widely expected that Pro Damascus government forces will enter the northern Syrian region of Afrin we're hearing that according to syrian state TV now there they'll provide assistance to Syrian Kurds who for the better part of a month have been trying to repel a Turkish military offensive this latest development follows a deal that was allegedly sealed on Sunday between Damascus and the Syrian Kurds now the Turkish Foreign Minister has responded saying that Ankara has no problem with pro-government forces entering Afrin but only so long as those forces are there to eliminate Kurdish groups that turkey considers terrorist groups if that's not their goal then certainly Ankara does have a problem if regime forces enter the city to eliminate the PKK and PYD terrorists then we don't have a problem with that however if they go there to defend the YPG then nothing and stop our soldiers now this part of the region has been embroiled in bitter violence for at least a month ever since Ankara launched its a military operation called olive branch against Kurds who it regards as terrorists now this fierce fighting has resulted in multiple casualties as well as civilian deaths on both sides of the conflict talking about civilians those who live in the Afrin region have hailed the potential entrance of pro Damascus and government forces into their area as a citizen of Afrin I do not find fault with the Syrian forces entering some points on the border as residents of Afrin we never wanted partition there is a duty of the Syrian government to defend its borders and protect a friend which is within Syrian borders anko launched its military operation after the Pentagon announced that it was helping to establish a Kurdish lead security border force along the Turkish Syrian border and corresponded with fury accusing the United States of essentially setting up what Accord a terror army since then the United States has tried to backtrack but essentially it's too little too late and the situation on the ground is really beyond the point of being able to change the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who's been following these developments carefully has said that America's involvement inside Syria has resulted in this bloodshed we are concerned about attendance to partition cereal and some of the plans that the US has already started to realize on the ground are worrying the u.s. claims that their only goal in Syria is to fight ISIL and to preserve the country's integrity but i think that washington needs to back its words with actions because right now actions look provocative the u.s. used the kurds to pursue its own ambitions and that's led to a major conflict in Ephron's now tensions on the ground continue to escalate despite the fact that in the past month the United States has tried on various occasions to try and deescalate the situation what remains now of course is to see how this latest development escalates tensions even further well we're going to discuss this further with military analyst Kemal Alam Collard a Kemal and welcome to the program let's start with what you think this development means for the conflict in the area I think it's quite a significant and positive development if it holds through and it's not completely surprising the Syrian Kurds had asked the Syrian government for help a week ago and the Syrian government themselves had said that it's their sovereign territory and it's only their forces that should be operating there and no non-state actors and if the same military go through and and the back in control of the area that means Turkey has really no legitimacy to remain in the area and they'll have to withdraw back to your Turkish borders so does that mean the Syrian government needs to pick a side in the conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish groups in your opinion it could be but it doesn't necessarily have to be because as we've seen that the Turkish reaction has been that the Syrian government goes there and takes over the area and there's no threat to Turkey Turkey has no problem with that so Turkey on on paper are still saying that they support Syrian sovereignty so Syrian being the government they have every right to go in there so it doesn't necessarily mean Turkey will be opposed to this however if the Turkish military remains there and come into direct conflict with the same military that could be a big issue yeah I mean what do you think the consequences are going to be with this alleged deal between Damascus and the Kurds I think the consequences are that the u.s. policy of using the Kurds for their own advantage could be could fall apart because essentially the Americans have been saying that they are present in northern Syria to help the SDF and the Syrian Kurds fights against the terrorists but there are no more Isis in that area and if the Syrian government moves in the u.s. have to move out so the consequences is that the last remaining card that the Americans had in northern Syria falls apart and and if the Turkish government realized that the Syrians have a right to be there this could be a very positive development if however the Turkish government choose to keep supporting the Syrian rebel groups then there could be a conflict you mentioned there that you say that you know maneuver and that the Washington that they'll have to move out how likely do you think that's going to happen how is it going to happen I mean at the moment the Americans have been very adamant they're not going to move out I mean Turkey which is their NATO ally have also asked them to move out especially from manbij which which isn't that far from a frame so it really depends because the Americans was were hoping and counting on the Turkish Syrian government's clashing if that doesn't happen that means the US has very little right to be there so at the moment it looks unlikely that the US will move out because they need a reason to be there so we'll wait to see it's still very early to make a judgement on what the Americans do next you know if we stick with their support do you think this new alliance is going to affect Washington's support for the Kurdish groups potentially we already saw for the last two weeks that the Kurdish groups were critical critical of the Americans saying that the Americans have abandoned us and we're on their own because once Turkish military moved in the Americans were not providing much support to the Kurdish forces so as far as the Kurds go there already were feeling let down by the Americans and that's why they've asked a Syrian government to move in because a month ago this probably would not have been on the cards but as the Kurds saw that America has not been a very reliable ally they've moved back to Damascus which had an agreement with them that they would help them as long as Syrian sovereignty is not violated in Damascus has the monopoly internal as being the state okay well it is a developing situation as always military analyst Kemal Alam thanks very much for coming on to the program
