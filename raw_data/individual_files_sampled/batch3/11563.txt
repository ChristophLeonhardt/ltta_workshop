as president Trump wraps up his official part of his controversial UK to a question still hang big time over that new trade deal or not between London and Washington as Caleb mopin explains in the lead-up to the meeting between the two leaders we saw the publishing of an interview with Donald Trump that suggested he was harshly critical of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom if they do a deal like that it will most likely because we'll be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK so it will probably kill the deal with if they do that their trade deal with the us's will probably not be made I think the deal that she's striking is not what the people voted on it was not the deal that was in the referendum I know they have a lot of resignations so a lot of people don't like it no but it'll definitely affect trade with the United States unfortunately in a negative way however when Donald Trump was speaking alongside to resume he argued that this interview was essentially he called it fake news he said that his words were taken out of context and that he actually has a very positive view of the British leader and that the relationship is doing just fine and like Trump Teresa may was also optimistic give our relationship in terms of grade the highest level of specials yesterday at breakfast lunch and dinner with her it's really something very special not an excellent discussion here there was something something very special this incredible woman right here she's a very smart very tough very capable person the broadest deepest and most advanced security cooperation special relationship I think Prime Minister may for her partnership have a lot of respect for the Prime Minister special relationship long tradition of friendship collaboration and I think she's a terrific woman I think she's doing a terrific job this isn't so much a question of Donald Trump's goodwill or Teresa Mays goodwill the special relationship this is a question of international law if you've committed to maintaining the the you rulebook as you put it I believe that that's what the the white paper suggests then you're not going to be able to form nimble trade agreements dynamic trade agreements with other countries because you're going to be stuck with EU regulations although Theresa May says otherwise so I think that's very confusing it's a little bit misleading to the public well as we saw a reaction from large sections of the British public to Trump's visits stood in stark contrast to the public reception of Theresa May and private reception maybe she gave him tens of thousands of people took to the streets of London decrying Trump's stance on migration and brexit I think Trump represents everything that we stand against and the policies that he's put in place and the rhetoric that he's used is harming millions of people not just in the US but globally and we think it's absolutely shameful that Teresa may went out of her way to invite Donald Trump here and to do so in our name and that's why our clear message here today is that it's knowing our name Donald Trump on the things that he represents are not welcome here Theresa May is willing to throw the country under the bus throw the the values and the opinions of the British public under the bus so that she can cozy up to Trump and that's absolutely unacceptable you
