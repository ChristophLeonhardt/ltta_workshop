RIVERA, THERE HE IS.
HELLO, EVERYBODY, HELLO, MAYBE
NOT.
>> GERALDO'S BIG HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
DID YOU CELEBRATE?
>> I CERTAINLY DID.
MY BIG SON, GABRIEL AND HIS
WIFE, DEBORAH, AND THEY LIVE IN
HOLLAND, THEY WERE FACING AN
IMMIGRATION VISA BACKLASH
BECAUSE HE WORKS IN EUROPE.
>> CRACKING DOWN ON RIVERAS?
>> DEFINITELY CRACKING DOWN IN
EUROPE, THE BIGGEST POLITICS IS
IMMIGRATION AND IMMIGRATION
CONTROL, BORDER CONTROL, ETHNIC
TENSION BETWEEN MUSLIM AND ARAB
POPULATIONS, MANY DISPLACED
PEOPLE OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND
THE INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS WHO
FEAR THEIR CULTURE CHANGING.
OF HIS ANGLE ON IMMIGRATION FROM
WATCHING THE BRITISH EFFORT
LARGELY DRIVEN BY IMMIGRATION,
>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
AS EUROPE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH THE MIGRANTS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
IN GREAT FALLS SAID THIS ABOUT
OUR PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRATION.
>> THE DEMOCRATS, RADICAL
IMMIGRATION AGENDA, WE BELIEVE,
THEY SAY, IN SANCTUARY CITIES
WHERE THEY HOUSE THE CRIMINALS
AND OTHERS, DEMOCRATS ONCE OPEN
BORDERS, WHICH MEANS LOTS OF
CRIME.
WE WENT TOUGH, STRONG, POWERFUL
VOTERS AND WE WANT NO CRIME AND
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT ICE.
WE PROTECT ICE.
THEY PROTECT US AND WE PROTECT
THEM.
>> IT SOUNDS AS IF IMMIGRATION
IS GOING TO BE A BIG CAMPAIGN
THEME RIGHT UP TO THE MIDTERMS
AND IF THINGS ARE NOT FIXED,
2020.
>> I DEFINITELY AGREE.
THE BLUEPRINT IS AS GRAPHIC AS
YOU CAN IMAGINE.
POLITICAL ASPECT AND THE
PRESIDENT TO EMPHASIZE FOR
EXAMPLE MS 13 AND OTHER
GANGBANGERS AND DRUG CARTELS AND
KNOW I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON
THE BORDER, THE REALITY IS A LOT
WE ARE NOT TALKING NECESSARILY
ABOUT IMMIGRATION.
IT IS DOWN IN THE LAST MONTH.
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS
ALMOST THIS THIS RULE ORGANIC
FEAR MANY PEOPLE HAVE THAT
IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO
FEAR MANY PEOPLE HAVE THAT
IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO
COME WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION OR
LEGALITY OR WRECKING AMERICA OR
A DRAIN ON OUR RESOURCES, PUBLIC
TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE VIGOROUS
WAY AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.
WILL LEAD THEM TO SUCCESS IN
NOVEMBER.
IF THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE
BREAKUP OF FAMILIES, THAT IS
THEIR ISSUE.
IF THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON ABOLISH
ICE THAT HELPS THE PRESIDENT.
>> I AGREE.
YOU CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT MADE A
TERRIBLE MISTAKE IN TERMS OF
FAMILY SEPARATION AND WE TALKED
ABOUT IT BEFORE.
THE POTUS WHO IS A DEAR FRIEND
OF MINE AND I WISH HIM THE BEST
BUT HE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE
IN TERMS OF FAMILY SEPARATION.
ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAS HIS
ANGELS, VICTIMS OF IMMIGRANT
CRIME, ENOUGH TO GIN UP THE
REPUBLICAN BASE PARTICULARLY
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS DEEP-SEATED
FEAR THAT THE WAVE OF
UNREGULATED DOCUMENTS IMMIGRANTS
FROM SOUTH AMERICA PARTICULARLY
AND AFRICA CHANGING THE NATION.
SEE NO OUT INSIGHT BETWEEN NOW
AND THE MIDTERM ELECTION, THE
TWO SIDES HAVE CHOSEN, DEMOCRATS
HAVE CHOSEN A MORE LIBERAL
APPROACH, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE
CHOSEN A LAW AND ORDER APPROACH
AND PEOPLE WILL --
>> THE SUPREME COURT IN MANY
WAYS, ONE ISSUE CAMPAIGN FOR
SOME PEOPLE.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS DRAWING A
LINE IN THE SAND BRANDING
DEMOCRATS AS THE OPEN BORDER, DO
AWAY WITH ICE PARTY SO WE WILL
SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.
I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE
SUPREME COURT, THE PRESIDENT
SPOKE ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT AT
THIS RALLY AND TALKED ABOUT
JUSTICE KENNEDY AND HOW HE GAVE
HIM TRUST, PICK SOMEONE HE WOULD
BE PROUD OF.
HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID.
>> I WANT TO THANK JUSTICE
KENNEDY FOR HIS LIFETIME OF
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE.
HE HAD CONFIDENCE IN ME, YOU'RE
GOING TO PICK SOMEBODY, GREAT.
IF YOU TUNE IN MONDAY AT 9:00 I
THINK YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY
HAPPY.
THREE FINAL CANDIDATES, YOU HAVE
AMY BARRETT, BRETT CAVANAGH AND
RAYMONDKETHRIDGE
HAVE INCREDIBLE BACKGROUND,
THE PRESIDENT HAS A WAY OF
BUILDING SUSPENSE.
NEIL GORSUCH WAS AN UNEXPECTED
DIG BUT I REMEMBER DEMOCRATS
KICKING THE SAME THING, HE IS
LET IT GO BECAUSE THAT IS THE
SCALIA SEAT, YOU HAVE A
HARD-CORE RIGHT-WINGER NET SEAT,
NEIL GORSUCH CAN'T BE WORSE BUT
THIS IS DIFFERENT, KENNEDY HAS
BEEN A SWING VOTE ON THE COURT,
WITH THE LIBERALS ON MANY 5-4
CASES, BIG DEFENDER OF ROE V
WADE.
IMMIGRATION IS THE BIG POLITICAL
ISSUE, DEEP DOWN IN TERMS OF
POLITICS AND ELECTED POLITICS
THIS IS ONE THAT WOMEN'S RALLY
WAS THE DAY THE PRESIDENT WAS
ABORTION.
90% OF THE CANDIDATES CHOSEN BY
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE SOMEONE HE
EXPECTS WILL REVERSE OR DIMINISH
ROE V WADE, 10% OF THE OTHER
ISSUES.
IN THAT MIX, AMY BARRETT SEEMS
TO BE ON APPELLATE COURT JUDGE,
ALL 3 OF THEM WELL-REGARDED BUT
SHE SEEMS THE ONE SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVES SEEM MOST
COMFORTABLE WITH ON THIS ISSUE.
CLERKS.
>> THINK HOW THAT WOULD BE
COVERED ON TELEVISION IF HE
MAKES THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TO SEE
JUSTICE KENNEDY GIVE A HUG OR
HANDSHAKE TO ONE OF THE PEOPLE
THAT WORKS FOR HIM AT ONE POINT.
>> EITHER OF THE TWO GUYS BUT I
THINK BECAUSE IT WILL COME DOWN
TO SOCIAL CONSERVATISM THAT
JUDGE BARRETT HAS THE INSIDE
TRACK.
WHAT DO I KNOW?
>> YOU COULD BE RIGHT.
MANY PEOPLE WILL COME OUT
AGAINST JUDGE BARRETT.
>> MORE PEOPLE CRITICIZE HIS
