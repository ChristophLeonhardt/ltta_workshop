1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
This voting machine is called a WINvote.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,589
It was used in American elections

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,980
between 2004 and 2014.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,070
In 2017, it took hackers just a few hours to play

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,960
Rick Astley on one of these at a
cybersecurity conference.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,460
Although the WINvote was out of use by
then, the stunt pointed to a real problem:

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,900
In most of the US, voting machines are over
a decade old.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,860
In 2016 voters in these

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,980
counties were using machines bought in 2008
or even earlier.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,220
At that time this was

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,120
America's most popular cell phone.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,260
Fast-forward to 2018 and the greatest

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,940
threat to these machines probably isn't
hacking.

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,370
They're not even connected to

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,440
the internet, so remote large-scale
meddling would be almost impossible.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,620
The biggest problem is that they're so old,
some of them may not be working right.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,560
For over a decade there have been
reports of apparent vote-flipping,

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,340
machine errors, and hardware breaking
down across the country, but even though

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,340
this happens every election very few
machines have been replaced.

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,820
And to understand why so many machines are
failing now,

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,920
you have to look back at the

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,740
2000 election between George Bush and Al
Gore.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,000
And the lead story at this hour is the State
of Florida is too close to call.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,640
A nation waits.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,280
Election officials decided to count all of the
ballots by hand.

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,500
Punch hole is called a

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,220
"chad", pierced but still attached.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,119
Hanging chad and whether it's an allowable vote.

29
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,580
What ballots count and what ballots
don't count?

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,110
A hanging chad is the

31
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,440
partially torn piece of paper left on
a ballot that isn't fully punched out.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,399
When the 2000 election went to a recount
Florida officials had to figure out

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
whether hanging chads represented a vote
or not.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,980
Clearly punched their ballot

35
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:10,470
correctly and there's a hanging Chad in
the back it may read one time as no vote

36
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,720
and then the second time as a vote.

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,740
After the recount, frustrated officials started

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,100
replacing their old machines with new
electronic ones.

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,420
Typically, state and

40
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,080
local officials would pay for this on
their own, but after the 2000 election

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,150
fiasco the federal government passed the
help America Vote Act,

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,300
which provided several billion dollars
to pay for new equipment.

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,240
Congress has

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,100
made a vital contribution to the
democratic process.

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,480
Now it's my honor to

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,120
sign into law the Help America Vote Act
of 2002.

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,640
The electronic machines got rid

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,680
of hanging chads, but they also
introduced new problems.

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,200
Officials without security training sometimes
chose weak passwords.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,340
The software

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,110
requires regular security updates and
some machines don't have paper backups

52
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,800
that can be used to audit voting.

53
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,840
A recent report on election security says

54
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,120
that conducting elections with
paper-based voting systems is one of the

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
most important steps states can take to
improve election security.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,480
The Help America Vote Act was the first time the
federal government provided funding for

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,880
voting equipment.

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,680
Now that money is
running out and many machines are failing.

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,160
Without federal funding some
states like New Mexico and Rhode Island

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,200
have provided money for new machines, but
in other states like New Jersey,

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,520
officials continue to work with aging
equipment.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,980
And there's a problem with

63
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:36,240
relying on local funding.

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,900
It can give an
unfair advantage to larger counties.

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,849
In Texas for example, two neighboring
counties have different budgets for

66
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:43,980
their voting systems.

67
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,700
Travis County is
home to about a million people.

68
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,799
In 2017

69
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,560
their election administration budget was
close to two million dollars.

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,660
Next door,

71
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,420
rural Blanco County budgeted only 46
thousand.

72
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,140
The problem with this is that state and
local officials are expected to pay for

73
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,800
new equipment on their own, but that's
rarely a priority in the budgets they're given.

74
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,360
On the other hand, the federal
government has a much larger budget.

75
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,870
For now, Congress has approved $380 million dollars to improve

76
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,360
the country's election infrastructure.

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,430
Whether that money will be used to

78
00:04:18,430 --> 00:00:00,000
replace all of America's aging voting
machines remains to be seen.
