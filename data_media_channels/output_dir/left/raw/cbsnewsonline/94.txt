00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:13,513
TO PREVENT THE ENTIRE REPORT 

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,248
FROM EVER SEEING THE LIGHT OF

SHAMEFUL.

187
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,755
MENTIONED IN THE DOCUMENTS IN 

188
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,157
THE SECRET ARCHIVES. 

189
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,960
THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVED FILES ON 

190
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,961
MORE THAN 400 PRIESTS. 

191
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,596
THEY WERE CAREFUL NOT TO NAME 

192
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,532
NAMES IF THE INFORMATION WAS 

193
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,867
TOO SCANTY TO MAKE A REASONABLE 

194
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,838
DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT HAD 

195
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:24,877
HAPPENED. 

196
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,145
OVER 1000 CHILD VICTIMS WERE 

197
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,948
IDENTIFIED BY OUR INVESTIGATION.

198
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,884
THE GRAND JURY NOTES THAT THEY 

199
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,754
BELIEVE THAT NUMBER WAS IN THE 

200
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,758
THOUSANDS. AS THE REPORT READS, 

201
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:43,029
WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE 

202
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,097
THE LIST OF PRIEST IS LONG, WE 

203
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,034
DO NOT THINK WE GOT THEM ALL. 

204
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,235
WE FEEL CERTAIN THAT MANY 

205
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,572
VICTIMS NEVER CAME FORWARD AND 

206
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,906
THAT THE DIOCESE DID NOT CREATE 

207
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:54,540
WRITTEN RECORDS EVERY SINGLE 

208
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,176
TIME THEY HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT 

209
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,546
ABUSE, THE GRAND JURORS WROTE. 

210
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,181
AS I DETAILED THE GRAND JURY 

211
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,183
FINDINGS, I WILL USE GRAPHIC 

212
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,419
LANGUAGE FROM THE REPORT THAT 

213
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,289
MAY MAKE SOME UNCOMFORTABLE, 

214
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,490
THESE WORDS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO 

215
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,259
ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN THE SEXUAL 

216
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,594
ABUSE COMMITTED BY PRIESTS UPON 

217
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:20,333
CHILDREN. 

218
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,868
THIS IS NOT TO BE SALACIOUS, IT 

219
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:27,206
IS TO SHARE THE TRUTH, TO KEEP 

220
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,574
A PROMISE THAT I MADE TO THE 

221
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,242
VICTIMS THAT I WOULD, IN THEIR 

222
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:33,245
WORDS, TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS 

223
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:36,948
ABUSE ACTUALLY WAS AND NOT RELY 

224
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:40,453
ON THE EUPHEMISMS THAT CHURCH 

225
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,721
OFFICIALS USED FOR DECADES TO 

226
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,788
COVER IT UP. 

227
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,222
CHURCH OFFICIALS ROUTINELY AND 

228
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:47,393
PURPOSELY DESCRIBED THE ABUSE 

229
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:52,365
AS HORSEPLAY AND WRESTLING AND 

230
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,166
INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT. 

231
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,901
IT WAS NONE OF THOSE THINGS. 

232
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:59,772
IT WAS CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE, 

233
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,943
INCLUDING RAPE COMMITTED BY 

234
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,411
GROWN MEN, PRIESTS AGAINST 

235
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:14,887
CHILDREN. ABOVE ALL ELSE, THEY 

236
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,522
PROTECTED THEIR INSTITUTION AT 

237
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,190
ALL COST. 

238
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,325
AS THE GRAND JURY FOUND, THE 

239
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,394

240
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:30,870

. THE PATTERN WAS ABUSED, DENIED

368
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,529
AND COVERED UP. 

369
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,429
IT NOT ONLY VICTIMIZE CHILDREN, 

370
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,198
IT SERVED A LEGAL PURPOSE, 

371
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,601
CHURCH OFFICIALS MANIPULATED 

372
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:30,336
THIS FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE. 

373
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,639
THE LONGER THEY COVERED IT UP,  

374
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,207
COULD PROSECUTE THE PREDATORS 

375
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,642
BECAUSE THE STATUTE OF 

376
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,044
LIMITATIONS WOULD RUN. 

377
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,379
AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE 

378
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,647
SYSTEMATIC COVER-UP BY SENIOR 

379
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,984
CHURCH OFFICIALS, ALMOST EVERY 

380
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,118
INSTANCE OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 

381
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,620
WE FOUND IS TOO OLD TO BE 

382
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,488
PROSECUTED. 

383
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:54,893
BUT NOT EVERY INSTANCE. 

384
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:55,828
THE GRAND JURY ISSUED 

385
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,729
PRESENTMENT AND WE FILE CHARGES 

386
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,963

PREDATOR. 

396
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,047

STARTING WHEN HE WAS EIGHT 

400
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,288
YEARS OLD. 

401
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,657
HE ACTUALLY MADE THE BOY GO TO 

402
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,993
CONFESSION TO ADMIT HIS SCENES 

403
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,163
-- SINCE. THE BISHOP AT THE TIME

404
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,432
KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ABUSE. 

405
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,635
AND COVERED IT UP. 

406
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,537
AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUS 

407
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,973
GRAND JURY IN ALTOONA 

408
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:45,844
JOHNSTOWN, TO FRANCISCAN FRIARS 

409
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,645
ADMITTED THAT THEY ENDANGERED 

410
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,780
THE WELFARE OF MINORS COVERING 

411
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,049
UP SEXUAL ASSAULT BY A FELLOW 

412
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:50,282
FRYER. 

413
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,551
THIS GRAND JURY AND THE ONE 

414
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,854
THAT PRECEDED IT DID NOT JUST 

415
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,356
WRITE REPORTS, THEY RECOMMENDED 

416
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,991
CHARGES WHERE THEY LEGALLY COULD

417
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,526
AND WE FOLLOW THROUGH. 

418
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,295
WE ALL WISH MORE CHARGES COULD 

419
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,199
BE FILED, DUE TO THE CHURCHES 

420
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,202
MANIPULATION OF OUR WEEK LAWS 

421
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,236
IN PENNSYLVANIA, TOO MANY 

422
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:16,141
PREDATORS ARE OUT OF REACH. 

423
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,176
THE COVER-UP MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE 

424
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:17,976
TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE FOR THE 

425
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:18,777
VICTIMS. 

426
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,480
CHURCH LEADERS AND EVERY ONE OF 

427
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,749
THE SIX DIOCESE HANDLED 

428

COMPLAITS OF SEXUAL ABUSE THE 

429
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,617
SAME WAY FOR DECADES. 

430
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,786
BY COVERING IT UP. 

431
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,355
THE GRAND JURORS WROTE, ALL OF 

432
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,223
THE VICTIMS WERE BRUSHED ASIDE 

433
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,159
IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE BY 

434
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,662
CHURCH LEADERS WHO PREFERRED TO 

435
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,665
PROTECT THE ABUSERS AND THEIR 

436
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,434
INSTITUTION ABOVE ALL. 

437
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,902
PRIEST WERE RAPING LITTLE BOYS 

438
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,171
AND GIRLS AND THE MEN OF GOD 

439
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,806
WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM 

440
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,776
DID NOTHING, THEY HID IT ALL 

441
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:55,814
FOR DECADES. 

442
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,748
MONSIGNOR'S, AUXILIARY BISHOPS, 

443
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:57,950
BISHOPS, ARCHBISHOPS, CARDINALS 

444
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,852
HAVE MOSTLY BEEN PROTECTED, MANY

445
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,720
, INCLUDING SOME NAMED IN THIS 

446
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,123
PROGRAM -- REPORT, HAVE BEEN 

447
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:04,890
PROMOTED. 

448
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,526
FATHER -- IDENTIFIED IN THE 

449
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,060
REPORT IS NOW A BISHOP. 

450
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,731
BISHOP LAUREL IS NOW CARDINAL 

451
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,031
WORLD. 

452
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:16,868
FATHER ZOO PICK IS NO BISHOP 

453
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:20,005
ZOO PICK. PREDATOR PRIESTS WERE 

454
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,239
ALLOWED TOREMAIN IN MINISTRY 

455
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:25,410
FOR 10, 20, 40 YEARS AFTER 

456
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,478
CHURCH LEADERS LEARNED OF THEIR 

457
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:26,878
CRIMES. 

458
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:29,081
IN THOSE YEARS THOSE LIST THE 

459
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,949
VICTIMS GOT LONGER AND LONGER. 

460
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,752
THERE ARE TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF 

461
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,853
THE COVER-UP TO SHARE RIGHT 

462
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:35,053
NOW. 

463
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,956
ALL ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE GRAND 

464
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:38,824
JURY REPORT. 

465
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,894
LET ME SHARE TWO EXAMPLES THAT 

466
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,097
SHOW THE LINKS TO WHICH THE 

467
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:45,931
CATHOLIC CHURCH WOULD GO TO 

468
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,567
COVER IT UP. 

469
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,602
THE FIRST CASE IS AN EXAMPLE OF 

470
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,703
A CORRUPT BISHOP PUTTING THE 

471
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,238
INSTITUTION AHEAD OF ITS FOX 

472
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,942
WELL-BEING AND REPEATEDLY LYING 

473
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,110
ABOUT IT. 

474
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,479
THE DIOCESE OF ERIE NEW FATHER 

475
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,814
WILLIAM PRESLEY WAS SEXUALLY 

476
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,884
ABUSING AT LEAST TWO MINORS AS 

477
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,953
EARLY AS 1987. 

478
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,087
INSTEAD OF REPORTING IT TO 

479
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:13,258
POLICE, OFFICIALS HELD MEETINGS 

480
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,592
WITH PRESLEY TO REVIEW THE 

481
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:15,894
COMPLAINTS. 

482
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,228
THEY NOTED HE NEVER DENIED THE 

483
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,364
ALLEGATIONS, DESPITE THAT THEY 

484
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,666
CONCLUDED THAT THE VICTIMS WERE 

485
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,601
TROUBLED AND HAD PSYCHOLOGICAL 

486
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,101
PROBLEMS. 

487
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,638
THE DIOCESE CHOSE TO SEND 

488
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,972
PRESLEY FOR EVALUATION BY A 

489
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,608
DOCTOR AND THEN PLACED HIM 

490
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,444
RIGHT BACK IN MINISTRY. 

491
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,915
AFTER THE CHILD SEX ABUSE GAMBLE

492
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,850
ERUPTED IN THE BOSTON 

493
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,550
ARCHDIOCESE IN 2002, THREE 

494
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,251
SEPARATE VICTIMS NOTIFIED 

495
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,187
BISHOP TROUTMAN OF THEIR ABUSE 

496
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,789
AT THE HANDS OF PRESLEY WHICH 

497
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,325
WAS DETAILED IN THE REPORT. 

498
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,392
TROUTMAN SPOKE WITH PRESLEY WHO 

499
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:52,164
ADMITTED THE ABUSE THEN, 15 

500
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,765
YEARS AFTER THE ERIE DIOCESE 

501
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,200
FIRST LEARNED THAT HE WAS A 

502
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,403
PREDATOR, THE BISHOP FINALLY 

503
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,738
REVOKED PRESLEY'S PRIESTLY 

504
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,006
FACULTIES. 

505
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,409
AFTER PRESLEY'S REMOVAL, 

506
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,711
RESPONDING TO PRESS INQUIRIES 

507
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,179
ABOUT PRESLEY, THE DIOCESE 

508
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,615
ISSUED A COMMENT SAYING THEY 

509
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,749
KNEW OF ONLY ONE ABUSE 

510
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,920
ALLEGATION AND HAD QUOTE, NO 

511
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,021
INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ON OTHER 

512
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,257
POSSIBLE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 

513
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:18,857
PRESLEY. 

514
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,760
THE DIOCESE LIED. 

515
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,263
BISHOP TROUTMAN HAD PERSONAL 

516
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,897
KNOWLEDGE OF AT LEAST THREE 

517
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,467
VICTIMS WHO HAD REPORTED THEIR 

518
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,534
ABUSE TO HIM. 

519
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:33,572
THERE WAS ONLY ONE ENTITY THAT 

520
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,573
BISHOP TROUTMAN APPARENTLY WAS 

521
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:40,078
HONEST WITH, THE VATICAN. 

522
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:40,912
THE BISHOP PRIVATELY DETAILED 

523
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:42,014
THE ABUSE TO VATICAN OFFICIALS 

524
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,881
IN 2003. 

525
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,852
WRITING IT QUOTE, CONFIRMS MY 

526
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,820
SUSPICION THAT THERE ARE MORE 

527
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,889
VICTIMS OF THE SEXUAL ABUSE AND 

528
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:57,763
EXULTATION PERPETRATED BY --. 

529
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,797
THE DIOCESE AND TROUTMAN WERE 

530
00:19:58,797 --> 00:19:59,998
TELLING THE PUBLIC AND THE 

531
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:00,899
FAITHFUL ONE THING WHILE THEY 

532
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,434
WERE TELLING THE VATICAN AN 

533
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,402
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORY. 

534
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:09,041
YEARS LATER IN 2006, TROUTMAN 

535
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,143
FINALLY CHOSE TO REPORT PRESLEY 

536
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:11,777
 

537
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,944
FALSELY TELLING PROSECUTORS 

538
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,413
THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS ONLY 

539
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,982
CAME TO LIGHT A FEW YEARS AGO. 

540
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,685
THE GRAND JURY FOUND THIS REPORT

541
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,819
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ANOTHER 

542
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:21,687
LIE. 

543
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,190
THE TRUTH IS TROUTMAN AND THE 

544
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,459
DIOCESE OF ERIE INTENTIONALLY 

545
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,028
WAITED OUT THE STATUTE OF 

546
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,497
LIMITATIONS AND CURBED THEIR 

547
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,366
OWN INVESTIGATION TO AVOID 

548
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,603
FINDING ADDITIONAL VICTIMS. 

549
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,006

635
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,148

THIS ABUSE WAS NOT ONLY NORMAL, 

690
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:36,768
BUT THAT IT WAS WHOLLY. 

691
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,903
THE CHURCH WAS NOT THE ONLY 

692
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:38,870
INSTITUTION THAT FAILED 

693
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,905
CHILDREN. 

694
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,305
THE GRAND JURY FOUND SEVERAL 

695
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:43,341
INSTANCES WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

696
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,509
LET THEM DOWN. 

697
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:48,680
HERE IS ONE EXAMPLE. 

698
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,914
IN THE DIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, 

699
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:52,617

REPORTED TO CHURCH LEADERSHIP 

702
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,589
CONCERN ABOUT AN ABUSE 

703
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,957
INVESTIGATION INVOLVING ONE 

704
00:25:58,957 --> 00:25:59,724
PRIEST. 

705
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:04,396
THAT QUOTE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT 

706
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,231
UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY HE HALTED 

707
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,365
ALL INVESTIGATION INTO 

708
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,934
INCIDENTS INVOLVING OTHER YOUNG 

709
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:12,137
BOYS. 

710
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,205
DISTRICT ATTORNEY MASTERS 

711
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,174
ACTUALLY TESTIFIED TO THE GRAND 

712
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:21,546
JURY THAT HIS REASON FOR 

713
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,380
FAILING TO INVESTIGATE AND 

714
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,049
PROSECUTE THE SEXUAL ABUSE CASE 

715
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,817
AGAINST A PRIEST WAS THAT HE 

716
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,619
WANTED THE DIOCESE SUPPORT FOR 

717
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,823
HIS POLITICAL CAREER. 

718
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,759
I HAVE DESCRIBED FOR YOU ONLY 

719
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,628
SOME OF THE ABUSE AND EXTENSIVE 

720
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,965
COVER-UP. 

721
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,634
THE FINDINGS IN THIS REPORT 

722
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,303
WOULD BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT 

723
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,571
DISCUSSING HOW THIS ABUSE HAS 

724
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,106
AFFECTED SURVIVORS YEARS AFTER 

725
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,607
THE ABUSE ENDED. 

726
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,541
CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IS 

727
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:56,014
TRAUMATIZING. IN THESE CASES 

728
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,315
THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF 

729
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,416
TRAUMA BECAUSE THE ABUSE CAME 

730
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,950
AT THE HANDS OF THEIR SPIRITUAL 

731
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,486
LEADERS. 

732
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,387
INSTEAD OF HEALING, VICTIMS 

733
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:06,558
WERE SHAMED, THEY WERE RIDICULED

734
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,392
, WHEN THESE CHILDREN TOLD 

735
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,393
AUTHORITY FIGURES OF THEIR 

736
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,460
ABUSE THEIR ACCOUNTS WERE 

737
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,262
QUESTIONED AND HUSHED AND 

738
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,866
SHUNNED. 

739
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,201
WHEN A YOUNG BOY RAN INTO A 

740
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:16,901
POLICE STATION IN SCRANTON 

741
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,402
AFTER HIS POLICE ATTEMPT -- 

742
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:19,971
PRIEST ATTEMPTED TO ASSAULT HIM 

743
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:24,008
HE TOLD THE MAN ON DUTY I DON'T 

744
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:24,843
WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 

745
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,678
THIS I JUST WANT YOU TO GET OUT 

746
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,278
OF HERE. 

747
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,279
WHEN ONE VICTIM IN ALLENTOWN 

748
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,514
TOLD A PRIEST OF HER ABUSE HE 

749
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,650
SAID TO HER, I DON'T WANT TO 

750
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,051
HEAR IT, YOU GO TO CONFESSION 

751
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,286
AND YOU PRAY FOR HIM. 

752
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,055
WHEN ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE SAME 

753
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,456
ABUSER PRIEST TRY TO TELL 

754
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,624
ANOTHER CLERGYMAN, THAT 

755
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,326
CLERGYMAN SAID DON'T SAY THE 

756
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,765
NAME. FOR THE RECORD, THE NAME 

757
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,735
IS FATHER FRANCIS --. 

758
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,337
ONE VICTIM, DESPITE BEING 

759
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,272
INSULTED BY A MONSIGNOR FELT SO 

760
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,141
STRONGLY ABOUT HIS FAITH THAT 

761
00:27:56,141 --> 00:28:00,078
HE HIMSELF BECAME A PRIEST. 

762
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,581
AFTER FEELING CHURCH'S APPEARS 

763
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,250
CONTINUE TO IGNORE SEXUAL ABUSE 

764
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,653
HE LEFT HIS CALLING AND HE NOW 

765
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,921
ADVOCATES FOR SURVIVORS. 

766
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,856
THE IMPACT ESPECIALLY WHEN KEPT 

767
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,792
SECRET LAST A LIFETIME. 

768
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,528
THE TIME OF TELLING THESE 

769
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,096
VICTIMS TO KEEP THEIR TRUTH TO 

770
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:35,547
THEMSELVES HAS ENDED. UNLIKE 

771
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,050
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SOME IN 

772
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,653
LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE HEAR YOU 

773
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:47,425
AND WE BELIEVE YOUR TRUTH. 

774
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,726
I WANT TO THANK THE MANY VICTIM 

775
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:49,561

776
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,828

SURVIVORS AND THEIR ASSISTANCE 

780
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,268
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. 

781
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:57,969
SEVERAL DOZEN SURVIVORS ARE 

782
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:02,106
HERE WITH US TODAY, EACH WITH A 

783
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,775
STORY OF LIFELONG IMPACT FROM 

784
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:04,108
THEIR ABUSE. 

785
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:06,778
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF 

786
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,846
THEM WHOSE STORY IS SADLY NOT 

787
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:11,850
UNIQUE. 

788
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:20,458
JOEY BEHE. JOEY WAS A SEVEN-

789
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,161
YEAR-OLD BOY FROM THE DIOCESE 

790
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:23,728
OF ALLENTOWN. 

791
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,865
HE WAS REPEATEDLY RAPED BY 

792
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,467
FATHER EDWARD GRAFF, A PRIEST 

793
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,002
WHO ACCORDING TO THE GRAND JURY 

794
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,905
RAPED SCORES OF CHILDREN OVER 

795
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:34,972
35 YEARS. 

796
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:37,909
FATHER GRAFF WAS A PHYSICALLY 

797
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,545
IMPOSING MAN AND A ALCOHOLIC. 

798
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:45,617
WHEN HE ATTACKED JOEY HE BORE 

799
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,853
DOWN ON HIS BACK WITH SUCH 

800
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,521
FORCE THAT JOEY SPINE WAS 

801
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:53,625
SEVERELY DAMAGED. JOY RECEIVED 

802
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,960
TREATMENT FOR THE BACK INJURY 

803
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,328
AND EVENTUALLY BECAME ADDICTED 

804
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,430
TO PAINKILLERS THAT THE DOCTORS 

805
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,632
HAD PRESCRIBED. 

806
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,866
HE ULTIMATELY OVERDOSED AND 

807
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:02,133
DIED. 

808
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:06,137
BEFORE HE DIED HE WROTE TO THE 

809
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,974
DIOCESE OF ALLENTOWN, FATHER 

810
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,809
GRAFF DID MORE THAN RAPE ME, HE 

811
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,645
KILLED MY POTENTIAL. 

812
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,879
IN DOING SO HE KILLED THE MAN 

813
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:20,084
THAT I SHOULD HAVE BECOME. 

814
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,453
JOEY'S MOM JUDY IS HERE TODAY. 

815
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,421
SHE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GRAND 

816
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,223
JURY. 

817
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,224
SHE SAID THAT THEY NEVER 

818
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:30,195
ADMITTED TO ANYTHING HAPPENING. 

819
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,596
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO 

820
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,931
PROVE HIS ENTIRE LIFE WHAT HAD 

821
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,565
HAPPENED AND HE WAS TELLING THE 

822
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:37,669
TRUTH, THEY NEVER ADMITTED, 

823
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,371
THEY NEVER SAID THERE WAS ABUSE

824
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,608
. I PROMISED JOEY'S MOM THAT WE 

825
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,543
WOULD NOT FORGET JOEY. 

826
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,379
THE ABUSE DID HAPPEN. 

827
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:53,451
THE GRAND JURORS BELIEVED JOEY. 

828
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:58,389
JOEY'S TRAUMA LED TO HIS DEATH. 

829
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,458
FOR THOUSANDS OF OTHER VICTIMS 

830
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,826
TRAUMA MANIFESTS ITSELF IN MANY 

831
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:02,694
WAYS. 

832
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,662
SOME ARE LEFT WITH SPEECH 

833
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,195
PROBLEMS, UNCONTROLLABLE 

834
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:09,601
STUTTERING, MANY TURN TO 

835
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:10,735
ALCOHOL AND DRUGS TO ESCAPE THE 

836
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,338
MEMORY OF THEIR ABUSE. 

837
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,739
SOME WERE UNABLE TO HAVE NORMAL 

838
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:15,807
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS OR HAVE 

839
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,242
CHILDREN OR SHOW PHYSICAL 

840
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:22,480
AFFECTION TO THOSE THEY LOVE. 

841
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,514
YOU HEARD BOB AND SEAN SPEAK 

842
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,716
ABOUT THAT IN THE VIDEO 

843
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,483
EARLIER. 

844
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,920
MANY ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. SADLY, 

845
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,222
MANY WERE SUCCESSFUL. 

846
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,523
DURING THE GRAND JURY'S 

847
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,393
DELIBERATIONS, ONE VICTIM WHO 

848
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,228
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY 

849
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,265
TRIED TO KILL HERSELF. 

850
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,667
FROM HER HOSPITAL BED SHE ASKED 

851
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,670
FOR ONE THING, THAT WE FINISH 

852
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,374
OUR WORK AND TELL THE WORLD 

853
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,809
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. 

854
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,113
FOR MANY OF THE VICTIMS THIS 

855
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,149
GRAND JURY REPORT IS JUSTICE. 

856
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,717
THE GRAND JURORS FELT A 

857
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,754
RESPONSIBILITY TO EXPOSE THE 

858
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,424
ABUSE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS 

859
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,492
TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE 

860
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,559
THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. 

861
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,728
IN THEIR WORDS, WE ARE GOING TO 

862
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,031
SHINE A LIGHT ON THEIR CONDUCT 

863
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,098
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE 

864
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,566
VICTIMS DESERVE. 

865
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,434
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR 

866
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,537
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE LAW 

867
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,972
CAN CHANGE SO THAT NO ONE WOULD 

868
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:21,773
HAVE TO CONDUCT ANOTHER INQUIRY 

869
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,007
LIKE THIS ONE. 

870
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,644
WE EXERCISE OUR HISTORIC AND 

871
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,414
STATUTORY RIGHT AS GRAND JURORS 

872
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,249
TO INFORM THE PUBLIC OF OUR 

873
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,016
FINDINGS. 

874
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,820
THE REPORT CONTINUES, WE CANNOT 

875
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,754
CHARGE MOST OF THE CULPRITS, 

876
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,056
WHAT WE CAN DO IS TELL OUR 

877
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,591
FELLOW CITIZENS WHAT HAPPENED 

878
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,226
AND TRY TO GET SOMETHING DONE 

879
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,194
ABOUT IT. 

880
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,197
HERE ARE THE FORMS THAT THE -- 

881
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,433
THAT THE GRAND JURY RECOMMENDS 

882
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,001
TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING 

883
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:50,868
AGAIN. 

884
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,539
FIRST, ELIMINATE THE CRIMINAL 

885
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,306
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR 

886
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,842
SEXUALLY ABUSING CHILDREN. 

887
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:01,846
CHILD SEXUAL PREDATORS SHOULD 

888
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,247
NO LONGER BE ABLE TO HIDE 

889
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,148
BEHIND A CRIMINAL STATUTE OF 

890
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:04,481
LIMITATIONS. 

891
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:07,318
THANKS TO A RECENT AMENDMENT 

892
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,319
THE CURRENT LAW PERMITS VICTIMS 

893
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,754
TO COME FORWARD UNTIL AGE 50. 

894
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,388
THAT IS BETTER THAN IT WAS 

895
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:13,691
BEFORE, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH 

896
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,861
ACCORDING TO THE GRAND JURY 

897
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:17,562
GIVEN THE PHYSICAL AND 

898
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,763
EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THAT SEXUAL 

899
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:23,768
ABUSE VICTIMS UNDERGO, IT IS 

900
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,669
WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THE 

901
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,670
PROCESS OF TELLING SOMEONE 

902
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,004
ABOUT THE ABUSE CAN TAKE YEARS 

903
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,474
OR DECADES. 

904
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,475
JUSTICE FOR THESE VICTIMS 

905
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,876
SHOULD NOT BE DENIED. 

906
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,044
PENNSYLVANIA LAWMAKERS SHOULD 

907
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:39,417
SEND A's -- A CLEAR MESSAGE AND 

908
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,118
EMPOWER LAW ENFORCEMENT 

909
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,051
AGENCIES TO HUNT DOWN ALL 

910
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:41,853
FUTURE CHILD PREDATORS NO 

911
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,321
MATTER HOW LONG THEY LIVE. 

912
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,923
SECOND, THE GRAND JURY URGES 

913
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,359
LAWMAKERS TO CREATE A CIVIL 

914
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,895
WINDOW IN PENNSYLVANIA SO THAT 

915
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,429
OLDER VICTIMS MAY NOW SUE FOR 

916
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,432
DAMAGES FOR WHEN THEIR BODIES 

917
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,735
WERE DEFILED AS CHILDREN. 

918
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,238
THE LAW GIVES CHILD SIX ABUSE 

919
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,806
VICTIMS TO SUE ONCE THEY TURN 

920
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:07,245
18. 

921
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,646
VICTIMS IN THE 30s OR OLDER 

922
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,480
FALL UNDER A DIFFERENT LAW, 

923
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,581
THEY ONLY GET TWO YEARS. 

924
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,117
FOR VICTIMS IN THIS AGE RANGE, 

925
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:13,951
THE WINDOW FOR THEM EXPIRED 

926
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,786
BACK IN THE 1990S, LONG BEFORE 

927
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:18,356
REVELATIONS ABOUT THE 

928
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:18,989
INSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF SEXUAL 

929
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:21,092
ABUSE WITHIN THE CHURCH. 

930
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,895
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. 

931
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,795
THE GRAND JURY PROPOSAL WOULD 

932
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,531
OPEN UP A LIMITED WINDOW 

933
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,366
OFFERING ABUSE SURVIVORS A 

934
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,199
CHANCE TO FINALLY BE HEARD IN 

935
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,101
COURT. 

936
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:34,539
ALL WE ARE ASKING IS TO GIVE 

937
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,973
VICTIMS THOSE TWO YEARS BACK 

938
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:41,045
THE JURAT -- GRAND JURORS WROTE.

939
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,880
I HAVE SPENT TIME WITH DOZENS 

940
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,916
OF VICTIMS, THOSE HERE TODAY 

941
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,851
AND THOSE ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA, 

942
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,687
NOT ONE HAS EVER EXPRESSED A 

943
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,956
DESIRE FOR COMPENSATION WHEN 

944
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:54,058
THEY CAME FORWARD AND SHARED 

945
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:54,458
THEIR TRUTH. 

946
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,793
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO 

947
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,429
WITHOUT MEANS TO PAY FOR THE 

948
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,231
COUNSELING AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE 

949
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,166
TREATMENT AND OTHER ASSISTANCE 

950
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,968
THEY NEED TO FIGHT THE DEMONS 

951
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,737
INFLICTED UPON THEM BY THE 

952
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,105
CHURCH. 

953
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:11,943
SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE 

954
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,277
LEGALLY CREATED WINDOWS FOR 

955
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,279
VICTIMS TO SUE. 

956
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,314
THIS REPORT DEMONSTRATES THE 

957
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,547
NEED FOR THIS REFORM IN 

958
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:21,686
PENNSYLVANIA. 

959
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,087
>>> ABUSE AND COVER-UP, THAT IS 

960
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,323
HOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 

961
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,524
PENNSYLVANIA IS DESCRIBING IT. 

962
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,492
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE LANDMARK 

963
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:29,160
MOMENT. 

964
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,193
AN INVESTIGATION WAS LAUNCHED 

965
00:35:30,193 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOKING INTO THE SEXU
