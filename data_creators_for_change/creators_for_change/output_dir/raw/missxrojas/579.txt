John Stuart Mill and other philosophers

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,899
actually the son of a friend of Jeremy

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,490
Bentham he came up with classical

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,710
hedonic utilitarianism<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill was raised</font>

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,590
in a completely utilitarian based way

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,460
taught that once you decide what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,430
based on and the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> happiness or</font>

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,439
pleasure it weeps and he came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,570
conclusion that he didn't agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,220
notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all pleasures are</font>

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,230
commensurable that is that two things

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,390
could be compared in the same units or

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,039
concepts and so on he believed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,539
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a distinction in the quality</font>

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,189
between higher and lower pleasures

16
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,840
higher pleasures were those of the mind

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,180
and spirit such as philosophy drinking

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,790
fine wines poetry conversation

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,829
literature etc lower pleasures of the

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,989
body with things like eating and

21
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,300
drinking just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental things not</font>

31
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,438
as far as to say that it's better to be

a dissatisfied<font color="#E5E5E5"> as human than a satisfied</font>

melz notion that sub 1 a come to judge

pleasures aren't thus higher and lower

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,770
but simply different rule or indirect

52
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,409
utilitarianism is the idea that rules to

53
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,149
maximize happiness are followed we learn

54
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,619
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience the kind of actions that</font>

55
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,630
in the long run contribute the most to

56
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,700
human happiness for example we learned

57
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,790
that killing and stealing don't

58
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,200
contribute a lot to long-term human

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,210
happiness like you might gain tantly

60
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,590
immediately by stealing but the

61
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,670
ramifications of that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> come back to</font>

64
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,610
rules do not kill and do not steal more

devout for example is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stealing from</font>

the rich to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the poor in the</font>

67
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,830
Robin Hood way we can pimp the idea that

68
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,690
stealing is acceptable and being

69
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,120
negative have negative consequence in

70
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,459
the long run because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if people</font>

would just wouldn't work a further

75

example quite relevant to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> societies</font>

76
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,700
if you punished an innocent man for

77

crimes he didn't commit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make everyone</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">feel at peace because there's like a</font>

be the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of act classical way to do</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it leads to the most</font>

82
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,350
happiness but the role would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not</font>

83
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,360
punish the innocent even if punishing

84

him would produce the most happiness

85
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,950
that's rule utilitarianism remedies the

86
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,810
problem of injustice and right<font color="#CCCCCC"> however</font>

87
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,030
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few criticisms of rule</font>

utilitarianism<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one Roy</font>

89
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,840
utilitarianism can't be proper

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,519
utilitarianism because you're allowing

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,989
other considerations other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tear</font>

which completely undermines the whole

essentially act furthermore Roy

114
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,100
utilitarianism must be followed rigidly

115
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,440
but surely utilitarianism was created to

116
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,319
keep us away from conventional moral

117

codes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're more utilitarian ISM</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">words because they are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rules but</font>

124
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,569
of relativism roles are surely ethically

125
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,670
relative cultural differences lead to

126
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,190
rules such as don't marry outside of

127

religion finally in morality cannot be

128

134
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,480
as I the penalty line is a penalty so

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,550
how can one rule from collection past

136
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,950
experiences be applied to a variety of

future experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> add in a two-level</font>

138
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,870
utilitarianism was a philosophy that

philosopher<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard hair came up with it</font>

140

says that we use normal thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

141
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,570
most part because our experience has

142
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,400
taught us generally the kind of things

143
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,560
that need happiness Richard hair thought

144

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can explain why gem in</font>

which have been found to lead people on

the whole to happiness the second level

160
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,230
moral dilemma is that if the principles

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,840
one holds conflict and we go to act

162
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,430
utilitarianism and use the greatest

163
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,470
happiness principle big criticism of

164
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,820
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that surely this is a meta</font>

165
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,000
ethical theory describing how things are

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,770
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Normandy I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

167
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,810
should do but just describing the state

168
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,669
of everything also how do you decide

169
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,680
what's an exception surely the statement

170
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,580
to mostly usable utilitarianism except

171
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,560
when there's a moral dilemma is circular

172
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,390
ideal utilitarianism is another one of

173
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,100
those normative and consequentialist

174
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,690
theories it doesn't go into intentional

shouldn't think of welfare preference

180

happiness or satisfaction but about

181
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,040
promoting intrinsically good things most

182
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,630
utilitarian theories seem to be

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,120
extrinsic like promoting extrinsically

184
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,740
good things like pleasures of the body

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,190
intrinsically valuable things if we

have to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> about more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

189
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,080
by personal affection and aesthetic

190
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,470
enjoyments like going to museum

191
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,760
improving your idea of beauty then we

192
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,250
are fulfilling our duty consequences of

practical view of the world again

relativism comes into play is BG not

199
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,760
ethically relative and what about things

200
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,320
like the sliding scale of friendship I

201
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,500
mean there's obsessive friendship is

202
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,590
that's not good and our friendships and

203
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,910
aesthetic<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoyment the only two good</font>

204
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,890
things I mean some idea you<font color="#E5E5E5"> two Terrans</font>

205
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,570
would say that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only GU Moore's</font>

account of things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there could be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things like love but love again you know</font>

208
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,490
stalkers not good what about things like

209
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge and virtue but the list would</font>

210
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,330
just go on and on and on we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

211
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">pursue the things that ideal</font>

212
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,100
utilitarianism claims arts are

213
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,840
intrinsically good therefore what would

214
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
be our reason for doing so that's

215
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,870
because the sentence it could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to why</font>

216

should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideal utilitarianism</font>

217
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,620
makes no comment whether correct or

218
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,240
incorrect on what human beings are

219
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,140
actually like and it's not an effective

220
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,790
decision procedure as it does not for

221
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,470
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> say where the line to save</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

222
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,419
is correct or incorrect and besides

showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all again collapses back at</font>
