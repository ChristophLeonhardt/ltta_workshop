1
00:00:00,473 --> 00:00:02,775
WHAT HAPPENED TO CALIFORNIA'S

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,510
ECONOMY OVER THE PAST DECADE

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,213
WITH JERRY BROWN.

4
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:08,881
>> THANK YOU, STEVE, THE

5
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:13,319
CALIFORNIA DREAM INCLUDING A 3 3

6
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:15,454
BEDROOM HOUSE USED TO BE

7
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:15,855
OBTAINABLE.

8
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:18,391
TODAY THE DREAM IS FAR TOO

9
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,292
EXPENSIVE.

10
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:22,828
CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST

11
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:23,262
ECONOMY.

12
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:26,999
IT'S THE HIGHEST IN INCOME TAX,

13
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:31,103
SALES TAX, AND GAS TAX WHICH IS

14
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:32,171
50-CENT PER GALLON.

15
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:37,209
THE STATE IS GEARING UP FOR

16
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,812
PENSION CRISIS.

17
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:42,348
THEY HAVE A LIABILITY FOR WHAT

18
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:44,483
THEY HAVE IN ASSETS.

19
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:47,019
THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM IS THE

20
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,954
NATIONS LARGEST PENSION TRUST

21
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:51,056
FUND.

22
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:54,693
IN 2016 THIS WAS ONLY 69%

23
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:55,327
FUNDED.

24
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:59,565
THAT'S A $168 BILLION LIABILITY.

25
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:01,901
MAKING UP THE DIFFERENCE MEANS

26
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:04,003
MORE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM POLICE,

27
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:06,238
FIRE, AND SCHOOL DISTRICT.

28
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:10,276
GOVERNOR BROWN PASSED A MODERATE

29
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:12,678
VERSION OF PENSION REFORM IN

30
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:14,713
2012 HE COULD HAVE DONE MORE.

31
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:17,249
HE TOLD CALIFORNIA CITIES HE

32
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:19,185
WOULDN'T BAIL THEM OUT WITH

33
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:21,187
REGARD TO PENSION COSTS.

34
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:23,722
MANY SAY HIS SPENDING RECORD

35
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:28,594
LOOKS MORE PROGRESSIVE LIKE

36
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:32,832
EXPANDING MEDICAL.

37
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,834
OVER THE LAST DECADE MAJOR

38
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,502
COMPANIES ANNOUNCED PLANS TO

39
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:38,704
LEAVE THE STATE WITH LOWER

40
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:44,376
CORPORATE TAXES.

41
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:48,514
TOYOTA, CARL'S JR., AND MORE ARE

42
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:48,848
LEAVING.

43
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:50,950
MOST ARE HEADED TO TEXAS,

44
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,252
ADVISORY, NEVADA, OR OREGON

45
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:55,588
WHERE TAXES AND HOME PRICES ARE

46
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:57,490
A LOT LOWER.

47
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,260
>> THANK YOU.

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,096
STEVE: A LOT OF PEOPLE BLAME YOU

49
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:06,031
FOR THIS PENSION PROBLEM.

50
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:09,668
YOU SAID IT WAS 400 YOU SIGNED

51
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:14,406
IN 1999 THAT HANDED OUT THESE

52
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:16,041
NICE PENSION ARRANGEMENTS.

53
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,177
DO YOU FEEL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

54
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:20,479
THIS FISCAL CRISIS THAT'S

55
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,680
HITTING CALIFORNIA.

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,616
>> IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN

57
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,783
I WOULDN'T DO IT.

58
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:30,990
I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT.

59
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,659
IN 2007 THEY WERE 110% OVER

60
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:33,993
FUNDED.

61
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,561
THE PROBLEM DIDN'T OCCUR UNTIL

62
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,296
THE GREAT RECESSION.

63
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:40,332
THAT INVOLVED A LOT OF FRAUD.

64
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:42,668
PEOPLE GETTING LOANS WITHOUT

65
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:44,036
SIGNING DOCUMENTS.

66
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:47,306
IT'S NOT JUST A RECESSION BUT

67
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:49,542
FRAUD PLUS A RECESSION.

68
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,677
THAT HIT THE PENSION FUNDS

69
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:51,977
BADLY.

70
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,412
YOU WILL SEE PROGRESS.

71
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:55,548
NOT FROM THE GOVERNORS REFORMS,

72
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:56,949
THEY ARE A GOOD START.

73
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,851
THE COURTS WILL STEP-IN.

74
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:01,320
TWO APPELLATE COURTS SAID

75
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,323
CALIFORNIA CAN ADJUST A PENSION

76
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,959
FOR A PORTION OF SOMEONES

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,795
EMPLOYMENT THAT HASN'T BEEN

78
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:10,129
FILLED.

79
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,032
YOU CAN ADJUST THE PENSION AS

80
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:16,569
LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE.

81
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:19,104
THAT'S GOING TO THE SUPREME

82
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:19,438
COURT.

83
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:20,739
STEVE: THE IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA

84
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,276
IS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE

85
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:24,944
COUNTRY --

86
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:27,813
>> IT'S A MODEL IN THIS REGARD.

87
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:31,350
STEVE: WE'LL GET TO THAT IN THE

88
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,021
NEXT PART OF THE DEBATE.

89
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,823
YOU ARE LIVING HERE NOW.

90
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:41,560
WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY TO ME.

91
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,696
I'M SURE THE CONGRESSMAN WILL

92
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:44,730
CHALLENGE ME.

93
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,635
I'LL PUT-OUT THE DATA WE HAVE.

94
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:51,804
YOU HAVE PEOPLE LEAVING THE

95
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:52,204
STATE.

96
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:54,340
YET, SERVICES ARE BEING CUT IN

97
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,474
MANY AREAS.

98
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:58,310
IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS REALLY

99
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:58,877
IMCOMPETENT.

100
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:01,146
>> HOW DO YOU HAVE THE FIFTH

101
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:02,648
LARGEST ECONOMY AND STRUGGLE

102
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:03,349
LIKE THIS.

103
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,684
HOW ARE SERVICES GOING DOWN AND

104
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:06,819
PRICES GOING UP.

105
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,856
HOW DO WE HAVE HIGH INCOME TAXES

106
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:11,991
AND HOMELESSNESS.

107
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,892
HOW IS A STATE IN THIS PLACE.

108
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:16,528
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO BE BUT

109
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,964
IT'S BEEN DESTROYED FAR TOO

110
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:19,665
LONG.

111
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:23,535
I'M NOT SURE HOW MOVING TEXAS TO

112
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,771
CALIFORNIA WE COULD BE IN SUCH

113
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:27,773
BAD SHAPE.

114
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,408
THE ANSWER IS SITTING ACROSS

115
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,809
FATHER OR

116
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:30,843

FROM US.R

120
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,515
STEVE: WOULD YOU SAY CALIFORNIA

121
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,384
IS A GOOD MODEL.

122
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:41,654
>> WE ARE TOP IN HEALTH AND LIFE

123
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:42,054
EXPECTANCY.

124
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:45,290
WE ARE TOP IN ENTREPRENEUR.

125
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,426
WE ARE TOP IN SINCE.

126
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:49,328
>> WHY IS EVERYONE LEAVING?

127
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:50,929
>> WE ARE GROWING.

128
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,898
>> THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE

129
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:53,499
GROWING.

130
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,334
>> WE HAVE MORE ILLEGAL

131
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:57,136
IMMIGRANTS AND AMERICAN BORN

132
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:59,038
CITIZENS THAN ANY OTHER STATE BY

133
00:04:59,038 --> 00:04:59,672
FAR.

134
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:01,674
THEY CAN LEAVE IN ANY OTHER

135
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:04,043
STATE AND THEY CHOSE LIKE YOU

136
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:04,843
CHOSE THIS ONE.

137
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,445
WE HAVE THE BEST SCIENCE.

138
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:09,481
WE HAVE THE LARGEST BUDGET

139
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,015
SURPLUS.

140
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,985
TEXAS HAS A $9 BILLION DEFICIT.

141
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:16,055
AS FAR AS THE LIABILITIES OTHER

142
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:19,224
STATES HAVE MUCH LARGER

143
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:19,625
PERCENTAGE.

144
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,428
STEVE: IF THE BUDGET IS SUCH

145
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:24,063
GOOD SHAPE WHY ARE THERE

146
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,964
SPENDING CUTS HITTING SCHOOLS

147
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:32,705
AND PARKS AND RECREATIONS.

148
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,940
WORKERS YOU SEE SPENDING CUTS.

149
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,976
>> NOT IN HIGHER EDUCATION.

STEVE: THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,213
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN CUT.

152
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,482
>> THE KEY TO SILICON VALLEY IS

00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:45,517
THE GREATEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY

00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:56,795
THE STATE.

158
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:58,230
>> THERE ARE OTHER CITIES

159
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,164
FALLING APART.

160
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:00,999
SAN FRANCISCO IS RUINED.

161
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,702
LAS ANGELES HAS 10,000 PEOPLE

162
00:06:03,702 --> 00:06:05,437
LIVING ON THE STREET.

163
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:09,842
STEVE: WE'LL GET TO THAT.

00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:12,411

00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:16,248
>> THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOOD AT ONE

167
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:18,383
THING AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:21,920
THEIR POLICIES LIKE AB 109 AND

PROP 47 AND 57.

171
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:27,092
WE HAVE A CHOSE TO BRING

172
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:28,193
LEADERSHIP IN THE STATE AND

173
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:30,496
BRING IT TO THE GOLDEN STATE.

174
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:32,865
>> DO YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH THE

175
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:36,101
CRIME RATE WE HAD UNDER

176
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:42,174
IT'S MUCH BETTER.

177
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:44,009
STEVE: I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED

178
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:44,977
THAT.

00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:50,983
IT HIT AN ALL-TIME LOW IN 2014.

00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:53,719
IT'S INCHED --
