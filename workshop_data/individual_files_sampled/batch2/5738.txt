Seana let's talk about better or work for a second because he raised more than 38 million dollars yeah in the third quarter which our mark Murray pointed out is more than Barack Obama raised in the quarter right before Iowa and New Hampshire in 2008 which is obviously there's some differences in online fundraising now but that's a pretty stunning number that has led to some hand-wringing about well hey wouldn't that money be better used in some of these other races that actually might be closer yeah I think that's one of those issues and also we have to say that the Republican Party are sorry the Democratic Party the DSCC isn't really putting a lot of money into Texas and part is basically none and part of that is because vetto has been so successful in raising money especially from outside of Texas I mean I think the question for them is that if he I'm sure they're not asking this question because they would never say he's going to lose if you talk to his campaign but if he loses what do you use some of the rest of that money for in terms of setting up the Democratic Party for the for the next two four six eight years and and I am interested in seeing what they do about that if he were to lose but you have three very interesting racists in Texas for the house you have Culver um you have Pete sessions you have heard as well in districts where you have a lot of Hispanic voters and right there those those three races they're pretty much very tight well and that's but that's also a situation we're having better at the top of the ticket also could mean that you pull some of those House races out for Democrats in a certain way all right exactly but you also have Greg Abbott at the top of the ticket on the gubernatorial side but I think that's part of what Democrats as well are counting on and I don't think that we count that Oh out quite yet because we haven't factored in the one point I don't know eight million new registrations that are not factoring in these polls and it is going to pull some of those Democrats through in these cases have we seen any poll I know they've been close where Bethel has been ahead I think the vast majority Ted Cruz has been ahead so I just don't seem look Ted Cruz is gonna win but he should be winning by two digits not by one digit I think that's a story in Texas hello youtubers if you're watching this checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more B to press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
