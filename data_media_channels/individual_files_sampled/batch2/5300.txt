welcome back we know that Cavanaugh's nomination fight will impact the midterms but we just don't know how President Trump said today he thinks the fight helps Republicans everywhere I go I'm going to Pennsylvania it's the same thing they are so in favor of Judge Cavanaugh you've never seen anything like it I actually think it's like a rallying cry for the Republicans they are so in favor of Judge Cavanaugh and some Republican Senate candidates are definitely hoping Cavanaugh helps them in Indiana the Republican challengers attacking the incumbent senator Donnelly Democrat there Donna Joe Donnelly for his anti Cavanaugh position calling him quote more concerned with standing with his liberal Democrat leaders than standing for Hoosiers in Missouri Democratic senator mccaskill Republican challenger Josh Haley has attacked her position on Cavanaugh ten times on Twitter since Friday and a Montana Democratic incumbent Senator John testers opposition to Cavanaugh was a big part of the recent Senate debate with his Republican challenger take a listen myself and a lot of the people across this nation are very disturbed with the way this entire process was handled there's a man who has a commendable record 300 decisions that he has written and he should be serving on the bench and absolutely I would vote for him let me bring in a couple of political strategists from each side of the aisle joining me now is Michael Steele former aide to Jeb Bush and John Boehner and Democratic pollster antastic greenberg alright guys and gals thank you for being on Michael Steele let me let me start with you there's a lot of anecdotal being shared with people like me I'm sure you're getting anecdotal how much do you think Cavanaugh is helping the Republican base right now and how would you describe Cavanaugh in general is it a net positive or a net negative it's a net positive I think that leaving aside the facts or the the allegations in terms of political perception there's a lot of people in America who think he's getting a raw deal a lot of people who think he's being criticized and attacked for standing up for protecting unborn human life and the Second Amendment and a lot of people who look if you look at the numbers in states like Indiana West Virginia Missouri North Dakota these are all places where a Democrat incumbent senator will be hurt by a no vote on Cavanaugh Anna you're pulling in a lot of these places is it universal or is it depending on where you poll well first of all the national numbers are pretty clear his favorability has gone down there are people who want him to be confirmed has gone down to the notion that this whole churning this week was somehow a net positive Republicans seems nuts to me including 65% people who believe Ford which is well beyond the share of the vote that are voting for Democrats I think this is a particular problem for Republicans in suburban districts in districts that have large populations of white collar and professional women who are already pretty angry and you know pretty involved pretty exercised volunteering giving money I think this is just take another piece of you know another insult another you know offense for people that just keeps them engaged with the election but address the specific states though that Michael address Zuri Indiana I played a clip from the Montana debate we have North Dakota West Virginia it plays a little different thing so well you have to to say that Cavanaugh helps in those states you have to assume that the people who support Trump are already engaged we've seen actually in the last month an increase in Republican engagement probably return to the norm around Republican turnout in midterms I'm just not sure that Cavanaugh adds more to it I just I'm just not sure I feel like the base is pretty consolidate in the Republican side they're already increasing intensity pre Cavanaugh I'm just not sure how much more it's really a partisan fight more than anything else Michael what do you make of that analysis no I think that I think that it's wrong I think that Democrats have been energized because of their opposition they're white-hot hatred of President Trump and this is an issue that is energizing Republicans bringing more Republicans to the polls we're not yet seeing that erosion that you would expect in suburban areas and in the house this offers some Republicans in moderate districts the opportunity to get a little distance from the president if you look at Leonard Lantz in New Jersey for example he praised senator flake for calling for the investigation and delay that probably plays were pretty well in his more moderate affluent college-educated district but Michael let me ask you this so let's say you get Cavanaugh confirmed party or Saturday we're still waiting for the election where voters show up to say thank you look there's no question that the Supreme Court is a big issue going to be a big issue as wasn't 16 it will be in these midterms but we are still several weeks away from which is an eternity in this news cycle so whatever happens on Cavanaugh in the next couple of days there will be a whole new series of events a whole new series of outrages a whole new series of fights between now and November 6 I rest my case so you just believe that while yes maybe they're getting some enthusiasm bump maybe it's mixing in with Labor Day and you just think it will pass post Labor Day two things have happened one there's been a pretty big shift away from Trump especially in the toss-up districts and I'm seeing it I'm involved in a lot of races and I'm seeing pre-post even like 10-point shifts and the generic congressional 10-point shifts in or even you know more on Trump's favorability and job approval and at the same time there's been more Republican energy this is in motion you know post Labor Day people are concentrating they're focusing to me Cavanaugh if he had been if it somehow had been derailed I actually think it probably would have led to you know on the right a pretty severe reaction well I'm very cynical about this I understand it but if he is derail you think that could have that that sort of perverse effect meaning it actually rallies the right absolutely but it will also rally the left even more because they won something in the context of complete Republican control and so I just think it's gonna be in that sense in that neutral and Michael I am curious I have heard two different arguments from Republicans on this if Cavanaugh goes down there's the conventional one that Anna's arguing that they'd sort of yes this is going to rally the right but then there's another that I think Kimberly Strasse makes the argument no no no no we're going to blame you Mitch McConnell and you and you scaredy-cat Republicans no I think I think the what's gonna happen is if Cavanaugh doesn't get the confirmation one you're gonna have a hugely outraged Republican base they're going to be excited to turnout on Election Day and there is still time to nominate another come another Supreme Court nominee between now and Election Day you're going to be able to avenge Cavanaugh and support this new probably just as conservative nominate by the way at Lindsey Graham calls for Rena the Republicans lose which they have on everything but the tax bill right they've actually not been able to do anything there's lots of stuff happening in federal agencies but I mean in terms of legislative victories it actually hurts them like losing the health care introducing that legislation and losing it hurt them so the notion that losing Kavanagh isn't going to hurt Republicans in the sense of not your rabid very ideological Trump supporters but your kind of average Republican who sees dysfunction and complete Republican control and can't get this guy through and in fact probably wonder why did they try in the first place if they knew he had these problems let me ask you both to tell me what a middle ground is on this issue or just can you not have a middle ground on this and I'll start with you how do you Heitkamp sure how do you help her find a middle ground here where she knows the majority of her constituents think Cavanaugh should be on board well first of all I'm not clear the Supreme Court issued like that the Supreme Court matters as much as pundits like to say it does right your average voter is like consumed with health care costs and you know hating the discourse hating the fighting they tune it out they think everyone's to blame so I wouldn't overstate how much this vote matters for these red state Republicans the middle ground is saying look I'm okay I will vote for a conservative you know for the court right as long as they are you know not a sexual harasser not you know a conspiracy theorist I mean the middle ground is to say I'm gonna vote for a perfectly qualified conservative it is not that I am against voting for a conservative was what the Joe Donnelly statement was when he came out again I'm not advising he's saying I voted for judge gore Shh and I would vote for another Michael Steele do it the other way what's the middle ground for say Dean Heller and martha mcsalley oh I was gonna do ribs I think that people do vote on these issues in red states I also think that if the FBI completes the investigation finds no corroborating evidence finds no new facts I think it's going to be very hard for senators like tester and hike camp and Manchin and McCaskill to go back to their constituents and explain why they voted no on a man that was cleared by the FBI well what do you do about appear dean heller or martha mcsalley where you're dealing with swing voters that they're you know they're not they're uncomfortable the other way I think Heller is in the Senate he's going to have to he's probably gonna vote yes and I think that mcsalley and say Marsha Blackburn who's another potentially vulnerable Republican who's not in office yet can probably come up with a statement that as long as the FBI clears this nominee they would be supportive Michael Steele Anna Greenberg thank you guys
