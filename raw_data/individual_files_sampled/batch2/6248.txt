Bernie Sanders swung through Pennsylvania over the weekend stopping in Philadelphia on Friday Philadelphia again later Friday night Lancaster Pennsylvania on Saturday finishing in Allentown Pennsylvania Saturday afternoon I eat a Chavez reporter what the intercept was with him for some of that tour we're gonna get her her reflections on Bernie's or her weekend with Bernie the the the Philadelphia trip began with a Q&A with Larry krasner krasner if you recall is the kind of radical prosecutor who ran in 2017 and unseated the establishment da there in Philadelphia and has very quickly implemented one of the most far-reaching prosecutor reform agendas that's ever been put into effect in the country how into the weeds did Sanders seem to be on on the issue because criminal justice reform feels like the kind of thing that he's for and he's gonna be on the right side of the of it and he's gonna endorse whatever but it's not breaking up the banks it's not Medicare for all it's not debt-free college no it is an economic issue but it's not and so did he let crasner kind of explain the specifics of it or did or did he get into it as well with him he connected it in the ways I he knows best so like pharmaceuticals the war on drugs marijuana those kinds of things he's good at connecting back to the criminal justice system but what I noticed is that a common criticism of Rainey by some people on the left has been that he doesn't really pay attention to the specifics of race and racial inequalities and kind of hyper focuses on economic inequalities I did notice that one of the people on the panel kind of did not really call him out but flash out his point and say you know race is also a big part of this because he was focusing on economic issues and so I almost felt like that was him kind of trying to make amends for you know his last presidential run I guess is paying more attention to that so from there he goes to a place that culturally couldn't be much more different than Philadelphia Amish country and Lancaster Pennsylvania you didn't head out to that trip right so this is this is for the the jest king Lloyd Schmucker race it used to be the you jest King Christina Hartman race that's that was the progressive Democrat running against an establishment Democrat in the primary Hartman dropped out when it when the district became redder after the Supreme Court redrew the boundaries so now it's just Jess King first the Republican and so Bernie went out to hold a rally there more than two thousand lefties showed up in Amish country to rally for Bernie Sanders and Jess King which is quite an extraordinary moment in kind of central Pennsylvania political history we'll see if that ends up translating in in the fall tool to an upset victory there you know this is a race that the Democratic establishment felt was so unwinnable that they literally had their candidate leave that race and from there he traveled over to to Allentown Pennsylvania so tell us a little bit about about that rally sure so the rally was at this Symphony Hall but it was absolutely packed the crowd was pretty diverse and they seemed pretty just riled up to see Greg Edwards and Bernie together a lot of people there said that Bernie's endorsement really kind of helped them decide on Greg Edwards it kind of gave him like progressively credentials so what was Greg Edwards like as a candidate as a speaker at the rally he reminded me a lot of Bernie they have the same kind of populist progressive message very inclusive but I thought he was a really fascinating speaker because he is a pastor he has like a way of moving people with his voice in his words not exactly the Bernie delivery yeah not not really the Bernie delivery you know it does remind me of like being in church a little bit but um people you know we're super inspired you know they were like crazy cheers deafening cheers and I'm from Allentown and I eat it actually saw my dad without without knowing it what was he up to he was a waiting to take a picture with Greg and I didn't realize it was your dad until I saw your newsletter this is a fascinating race that's going on right now it has this guy John morganelli who after the election multiple times tweeted at Donald Trump not the way that most of you all tweet at Donald Trump but trying to get a job with him then look it's one thing if you're you look you're hard up you need work whatever how pitiful is this that the way that you're going to try to get a job with Trump is tweeting at him and of course it didn't work he even offered his legal services to represent a Vanka when she got in that weird thing with the airline this is like a post midnight tweet that morganelli sent out and there's a reason he was trying to get a job with the Trump administration the politics all line up he's kind of Pro NRA he's anti-choice he's anti-immigrant he's running now in the Democratic primary for Congress he has two opponents one Greg Edwards who I eat a saw speak on Saturday and the other Susan wild who's now has the backing of Emily's list which is putting about a million dollars into try to elect her her problem though she was the solicitor for the city of Allentown in 2015 is Allentown police officer just brutally assaulted a suspect kicking him in the job knocking his teeth out breaking breaking his jaw and in 2016 she put out a statement saying that his she had thoroughly reviewed the situation and that his actions were appropriate under the circumstances and that she looked forward to defending him in court that didn't happen they want wound up settling it for a hundred sixty thousand dollars and as you can see in the video yourself nobody can really look at that and genuinely believe that it was appropriate under the circumstances so having been to the district the primary is May 15th what what's your sense of how this plays out so I think morganelli definitely has the most name recognition which is what people in the district we're saying but I actually think that Bernie might be able to like move the needle because I heard from a lot of people after the rally that they were kind of overwhelmed with the number of candidates who were running and Bernie's endorsement kind of helped them like weed through and kind of figure out like who is most closely aligned with my progressive politics what about Susan Wilde the emily's list backed candidate what people have thoughts on her I did hear a couple who didn't really have like that big of concerns over her defense of the officer who like shattered that guy's jaw my own dad when I talked to him about it he had been kind of leaning toward Wilde earlier my dad was like I like Edwards but I think while it has a better chance of beating the Republican in the general election but after the Edwards rally he he changed his mind you do you think that they were all Edwards supporters who showed up for the rally or do you think they were kind of curious Democrats who came away Edwards supporters I think a good amount of them were Edwards supporters and I also think the other chunk of people were just really hyped to see Bernie speak and they came out being convinced like Edwards this is our guy
