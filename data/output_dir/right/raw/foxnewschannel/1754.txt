00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,440
JOURNALIST WILLING TO PROTECT

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,743
RESOURCES AND GO TO JAIL?

3
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:04,977
>> YOU HAVE THE LAW THAT ALLOWS

4
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:06,145
YOU TO PROTECT SOURCES.

5
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:07,113
WE HAVE THE ATTORNEY WORK

6
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:07,446
PRODUCT.

7
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:08,781
THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR.

8
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,516
>> Martha: NOW THAT AVENATTI'S

9
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:11,951
INTEGRITY IS BEING QUESTIONED BY

10
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,052
SOME, HE IS THREATENING THOSE

11
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:14,387
WHO ARE DIGGING AROUND IN HIS

12
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:16,756
BACKGROUND, INCLUDING

13
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:17,623
"THE DAILY CALLER," WHERE THIS

14
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:22,028
ARTICLE WAS POSTED.

15
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:24,931
"AVENATTI IN THE SPOTLIGHT HIS

16
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,264
NEXT --

17
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:25,898
MY NEXT GUEST IS ALSO THE

18
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,434
SUBJECT OF AVENATTI'S FIRE.

19
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:30,736
LONGTIME CLINTON ADVISOR MIKE

20
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:31,971
PENN RECENTLY WROTE A VERY TOUGH

21
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:35,908
PIECE FOR THE HILL.

22
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:37,310
WHO IS PAYING MICHAEL AVENATTI?

23
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,744
SUGGESTING THE REAL MOTIVATIONS

24
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:39,278
MIGHT BE POLITICAL.

25
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:43,349
HERE NOW IS MIKE PENN AND FORMER

26
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:43,916
ADVISOR TO

27
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:44,550
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.

28
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,551
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

29
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:46,886
YOU SAY IN YOUR PIECE AVENATTI

30
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:47,653
IS ACTING LESS LIKE AN ATTORNEY

31
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:50,456
AND MORE LIKE A JOURNALIST OR

32
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:51,390
SOMEONE DOING OPERA RESEARCH FOR

33
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,458
A DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

34
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,360
EXACTLY WHO IS HE YOU SAY?

35
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,666
A LAWYER, AND OPPOSITION OR

36
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,734
CAMPAIGN OPERATIVE?

37
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:02,835
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND WHERE

38
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:05,938
THAT IS 100 INTERVIEWS ON CNN

39
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:07,306
AND TELLS THEIR CLIENT TO IGNORE

40
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:08,374
A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.

41
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:09,141
IT RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND

42
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,344
ALL I DID WAS REALLY QUESTION

43
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:12,945
WHERE IS HE BEING PAID?

44
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:14,046
IT SAYS HE'S GOT A CROWD SOURCED

45
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,381
FUNDING BUT THAT WAS NOT SET UP

46
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:17,016
UNTIL HE WAS REPRESENTING HER

47
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:17,750
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

48
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,986
IF SO WHERE IS THAT $500,000

49
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,921
THAT HE HAS RAISED GOING?

50
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,522
NO ACCOUNTING TO THAT.

51
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,925
WHERE DID HE GET THESE BANK

52
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:26,659
RECORDS THAT MAYBE THE TREASURY

53
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,128
AND PROSECUTORS WOULD HAVE?

54
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:30,963
IS AT WORK PRODUCT.

55
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:31,931
HE'S DISCLOSED IT.

56
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,332
HE'S WAIVED ANY PRIVILEGE BY

57
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:33,933
DISCLOSING.

58
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,135
IF THESE ARGUMENTS ARE NONSENSE.

59
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:36,869
HE'S OUT GIVING 100 INTERVIEWS

60
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,738
AND LET ME TELL YOU, HE'S NOT

61
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:39,472
HELPING DEMOCRATS BECAUSE SINCE

62
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:42,508
HE WENT OUT THERE WITH STORMY

63
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:43,209
DANIELS, DEMOCRATS HAVE TANKS

64
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,778
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

65
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,213
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT

66
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:48,314
THE MIDDLE EAST TO END

67
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:49,749
NORTH KOREA AND DEMOCRATS ARE

68
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:50,750
SITTING THERE WITH STORMY

69
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,150
DANIELS.

70
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,753
I DON'T THINK WE WANT A REPEAT

71
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:54,520
OF 1998 AND SURELY THIS GUY IS

72
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,223
NOT THE GUY WE WANT SPEAKING ON

73
00:01:57,223 --> 00:02:00,359
BEHALF OF DEMOCRATS FOR SURE.

74
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,127
>> Martha: IT'S INTERESTING

75
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,161
BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY WORKED FOR

76
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:05,364
BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON, A

77
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:06,165
LONGTIME DEMOCRAT AND GET YOU

78
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:07,800
TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH THE

79
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,967
PIECES THAT YOU ARE WRITING, YOU

80
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,301
HAVE BEEN SORT OF STICKING UP

81
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,138
FOR THE ARGUMENT THAT

82
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:13,572
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING HERE,

83
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:14,740
IS THAT WHAT DRIVES YOU?

84
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,142
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN

85
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:16,742
THAT ROAD AGAIN?

86
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:19,345
THAT YOU FEEL LIKE WHAT HAPPENED

87
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:20,746
IN 1998 WAS A TRAVESTY?

88
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:21,580
>> EXACTLY.

89
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,050
I SPENT A YEAR FIGHTING AGAINST

90
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,619
KEN START AND WE DECIDED AS A

91
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:29,355
COUNTRY, LOOK, THESE PERSONAL

92
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:30,189
ACTIONS, WE CAN'T HAVE PERJURY

93
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,225
TRAPS AND OTHER WAYS OF TRAPPING

94
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:35,661
PEOPLE INTO VIOLATIONS OVER YOUR

95
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:36,962
THAT WE HOLD UP THE WHOLE

96
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:37,363
COUNTRY FOR.

97
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:38,798
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND THE

98
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:39,832
EFFORTS CASE, IT DIDN'T MAKE

99
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:42,201
SENSE IN THE CLINTON CASE AND I

100
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:42,968
WISH MORE DEMOCRATS AND

101
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:43,736
REPUBLICANS WOULD GET TOGETHER

102
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:44,970
AND SAY LET'S FIGHT IT OUT ON

103
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,572
THE ISSUES, LET'S VOTE PEOPLE

104
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:47,973
OUT WE DON'T LIKE, LET'S NOT TRY

105
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:49,842
TO CRIMINALIZE EVERYTHING AND

106
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:51,944
YOU BET I THINK IT WAS WRONG IN

107
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,079
'98 AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

108
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,847
WRONG NOW AND I THINK MORE

109
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,382
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT ON

110
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:56,682
THAT.

111
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:57,983
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

112
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:58,951
MICHAEL AVENATTI?

113
00:02:58,951 --> 00:02:59,985
IS TWEETING ABOUT YOU.

114
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:01,654
TOO BAD HE DIDN'T DO ANY BASIC

115
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:03,622
RESEARCH FOR HIS RIDICULOUS

116
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:04,156
PIECE IN THE HILL.

117
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:10,396
HE GOES ON TO SAY WE DID NOTHING

118
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:11,063
WRONG.

119
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:15,134
>> AS I SAID, HE SET THIS UP

120
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:15,801
SOMETIME LATER AFTER HE GOT

121
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,536
QUESTIONS FROM JOURNALISTS AND

122
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:19,438
THEN THE QUESTION IS WHERE'S THE

123
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:20,639
MONEY AND IN THE QUESTION IS

124
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,108
WHERE DID HE GET THESE DOCUMENTS

125
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,444
AND WHAT THEIR AUTHENTICITY AND

126
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:26,378
WAS SOMETHING DONE ILLEGALLY AND

127
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:27,780
IS THERE ANOTHER OPERA RESEARCH

128
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,915
SET UP.

129
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,750
BEHIND HIM THAT'S BEING PAID BY

130
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,084
DONORS.

131
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:33,919
IT GOT TO READ HIS STATEMENTS

132
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,187
VERY CAREFULLY.

133
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:35,821
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DENY

134
00:03:35,821 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYTHING HE SAYS HE IS DENIED
