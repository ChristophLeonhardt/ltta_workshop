1
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,321
THE MID-TERM ELECTION.

2
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:07,723
HERE WITH REACTION, FORMER TRUMP

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,091
CAMPAIGN MANAGER COREY

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:14,897
LEWANDOWSKI AND CONSERVATIVE

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,865
COLUMNIST, ANN COULTER AUTHOR OF

6
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,600
"RESISTANCE IS FUTILE."

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,202
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST OF

8
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,837
FAIR AND BALANCED PANEL I HAVE

9
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:22,705
EVER HAD.

10
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,907
BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING TO

11
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:25,941
PLAY A DEMOCRAT.

12
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,910
I AM JUST KIDDING.

13
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:30,479
I WANT TO PLAY SOME SOUND OF THE

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,582
PRESIDENT PRAISING MITCH

15
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,049
MCCONNELL.

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,517
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE'LL GO DOWN

17
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:37,820
AS THE GREATEST LEADER IN MY

18
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:38,721
OPINION IN HISTORY.

19
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:41,023
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE

20
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:41,824
TOGETHER.

21
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,659
BUT HE'S BETTER WHEN I'M

22
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,961
PRESIDENT THAN HE EVER WAS WHEN

23
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:50,032
ANYBODY ELSE WAS PRESIDENT.

24
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:53,302
JESSE: MAKE MITCH GREAT AGAIN.

25
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,472
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TURN THAT

26
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:56,972
INTO IMMIGRATION.

27
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,542
>> GIVE ME 30 SECONDS.

28
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:03,078
RIGHT AFTER KAVANAUGH GETS

29
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,880
THROUGH YOU HAVE GOT TO PRAISE

30
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:05,547
MITCH MCCONNELL.

31
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:08,317
BUT THE MISTAKE OF THE TRUMP

32
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,085
ADMINISTRATION SO FAR IS TRUMP

33
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,453
GIVING INTO THE MITCH MCCONNELL

34
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:13,922
AGENDA RATHER THAN THE OTHER WAY

35
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:15,224
AROUND.

36
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,760
MCCAIN COULDN'T WIN THE WAY THE

37
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,062
COUNTRY HAS BEEN CHANGED BY

38
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:20,462
IMMIGRATION.

39
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,264
TRUMP WON, SO WHY DON'T

40
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:23,499
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS THINK

41
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,001
THIS GUY KNOWS HOW TO DO IT.

42
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,670
LET'S BE LIKE HIM AND PASS

43
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,139
FUNDING FOR THE WALL.

44
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,775
NO, THEY GO BACK TO THE OLD

45
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,109
REPUBLICAN PLAYBOOK.

46
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,843
TAX CUTS.

47
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,912
MILITARY SPENDING.

48
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:37,913
CONTINUE THE VARIOUS WARS WE

49
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:39,548
HAVE AROUND THE UNIVERSE.

50
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:42,451
WHO ARE THE BIGGEST STARS RIGHT

51
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,954
NOW IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?

52
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,289
DONALD TRUMP, LINDSEY GRAHAM AND

53
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,894
THAT WONDERFUL BILL CASSIDY.

54
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,262
WHAT DID THEY DO?

55
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,097
THEY STOOD UP FOR LIBERALS.

56
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,766
YOU KNOW THE BILL CASSIDY CLIP

57
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,201
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

58
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,505
JESSE: HE GOES UP TO A WOMAN WHO

59
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:09,611
BROUGHT HER KIDS AND SHE SAID

60
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:14,450
YOU ARE RUINING MY CHILDREN'S

61
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,818
FUTURE.

62
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,287
AND HE SAID YOUR MOTHER IS

63
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:23,058
TURNING YOU INTO A PAWN.

64
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,294
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO PRAISE

65
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:28,363
MITCH MCCONNELL FOR GETTING THE

66
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:29,331
FEDERAL JUDGES BEFORE THE

67
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:29,998
SYSTEM.

68
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,569
HE PUT 84 JUDGES INTO THE SYSTEM

69
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,876
WHICH HAS LONG-TERM EFFECTS.

70
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:42,511
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS DON'T

71
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:44,546
AGAINST THE WILL OF THE SENATE.

72
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:48,383
HE JUST NOMINATED MORE PEOPLE TO

73
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,253
THE 9th CIRCUIT THAT WERE

74
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,821
WITHOUT THE ADVICE AND CONSENT

75
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,690
OF THE TWO SENATORS FROM

76
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:55,324
CALIFORNIA.

77
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,193
THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE HAD TO GO

78
00:02:58,194 --> 00:02:59,528
ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT

79
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,097
FOR A 9-0 DECISION TO SAY THE

80
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:02,865
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

81
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,333
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PREVENT

82
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,235
PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO THIS

83
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,003
COUNTRY HE BELIEVES ARE A

84
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,671
DETRIMENT TO OUR COUNTRY.

85
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,206
THE SAME POWER EVERY PRESIDENT

86
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,509
HAS USED SINCE WORLD WAR II.

87
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,113
BUT WE HAVE SEEN JUDGES TOO

88
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,616
OFTEN LEGISLATING FROM THE

89
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:20,916
BENCH.

90
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,618
THEY HAVE CHANGED THE COURT

91
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:27,156
SYSTEM WHICH WILL HAVE LONG-TERM

92
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,056
RAMIFICATION.

93
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,558
JESSE: I WANT TO PLAY SOME

94
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,993
UPPING SOUND OF THE PRESIDENT

95
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:32,461
TODAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

96
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,464
HE JUST SECURED THE RELEASE OF A

97
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,032
PRISONER ABROAD FROM TURKEY.

98
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:45,474
LET'S WATCH THIS SPECIAL MOMENT.

99
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,143
IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHEN HE WAS

100
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,478
THERE PRAYING WITH THE PASTOR

101
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,880
WHO WAS JUST RELEASED FROM

00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,615
TURKEY, CAN WE PLAY THAT.

103
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,652
WE ALL SAW THAT TODAY.

104
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,921
I KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

105
00:03:58,922 --> 00:03:59,321
IMMIGRATION.

106
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,323
BUT IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT

107
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,325
WHEN HE SECURED THE RELEASE OF

108
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,126
THIS PRISONER.

109
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,394
THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE THAT

110
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,596
CONSIST TEMPTLY WHETHER IT'S IN

111
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,831
NORTH KOREA, WHETHER IT'S AND  *

112
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,300
OR ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

113
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,202
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN

114
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:15,537
THEY SEE THIS, WHEN THEY SEE

115
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,272
THIS, IT SHOWS THIS PRESIDENT

116
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,308
REALLY CARES ABOUT EACH

117
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:19,875
INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN.

118
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,676
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.

119
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,880
>> ALL OF THE PASTORS, AND A LOT

120
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,683
OF BLACK PASTORS PRAYING WITH

121
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,551
TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

122
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:32,721
I THOUGHT IT WAS SINCERE AND GIN

123
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:36,858
WIN WHAT HE SAID IN RESPONSE TO

124
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,126
THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPE, THAT

125
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:39,461
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS

126
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:43,031
CHANGED HIM.

127
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:49,037
JESSE: LOOK AT THE PIOUS, HUMBLE

128
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,041
TRUMP WOWING DOWN RIGHT THERE.

129
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,579
>> YOU DON'T HAVE SO MANY

130
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,348
CHRISTIANS PRAYING OVER YOU AND

131
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,482
BRINGING A YOU WITHOUT IT HAVING

132
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,183
AN EFFECT.

133
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:03,819
>> BRINGING AMERICANS HOME WHO

134
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,754
HAVE BEEN CAPTIVE OVERSEAS.

135
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,323
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE

136
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:10,659
WOMAN WHO WAS A CAPTIVE IN EGYPT

137
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,994
AND HE BROUGHT HER HOME.

138
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:14,329
HE WENT TO JOINT BASE ANDREWS

139
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,032
ONE NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT TO SEE

140
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,567
PEOPLE COMING HOME OFF THAT

141
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,301
PLANE.

142
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:22,004
WITHOUT BUCKET LOADS OF MONEY

143
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:25,574
AND PELLET LOADS OF CASH.

144
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,379
HE'S NOT --AL LET

145
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,412
HE'S NOT -- P LET

146
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:30,445
HE'S NOT -- PALET

00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:33,615
HE'S NOT -- PALLET LOADS OF

148
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:33,915
CASH.

149
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,052
AND THIS TIME THEY UNDERSTAND IF

150
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:40,956
YOU CROSS THIS PERSON THERE WILL

151
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:47,195
BE A WE SOURCE.

152
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:49,464
>> CAN I BE THE DEMOCRAT HERE.

153
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:51,099
THOUGH THAT IS TRUE.

154
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,802
I'M NOT THAT ENTHUSIASTIC.

155
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:55,270
THAT'S NOT BRINGING PEOPLE OUT

156
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,838
TO VOTE.

157
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,741
WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING IN THESE

158
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,443
RIDICULOUS COUNTRIES ANYWAY.

159
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,345
I FEEL LIKE IT'S SKIERS WHO GO

160
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,882
OFF INTO A NO-SKIING AREA,

161
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:09,084
AVALANCHE WARNING DON'T GO, AND

162
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,752
WE HAVE TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY

163
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:14,089
TO GET THEM BACK.

164
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,325
JESSE: TURKEY CAN BE A VERY NICE

165
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:17,793
PLACE TO BE.

166
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,429
>> IT'S A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

167
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,067
THING TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN

168
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:25,400
PEOPLE.

169
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:29,905
JESSE: THE PRESIDENT DELINEATED

170
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:30,205
THAT.

171
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,840
PRESIDENT TRUMP: THE FACT IS

172
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,009
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE PARTY

173
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,177
OF CRIME.

174
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,379
THEY HAVE.

175
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,681
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF

176
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,084
SAFETY, AND WE ARE THE PARTY OF

177
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,653
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.

178
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,188
JESSE: THE PRESIDENT HAS I

179
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,657
BELIEVE A GIFT POLITICALLY FOR

180
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,759
IN PLAQUE AND WHITE TERMS.

181
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,195
THEY ARE SOCIALISTS, WE ARE

182
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:53,762
CAPITALISTS.

183
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:57,232
WE LIKE LAW AND ORDER, THEY LOVE

184
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:57,566
CRIME.

185
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,334
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER PUT

186
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,902
ANYTHING THOSE TAX TERMS BEFORE

187
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,804
AND THAT'S DRIVING THESE

188
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,072
LIBERALS MAD.

189
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:08,543
>> HE GOES ALONG WITH JARED

190
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,579
KUSHNER'S IDEA ON PRISON REFORM.

191
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,015
HE'LL BE THE CRIME PRESIDENT.

192
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,117
WARNING, MR. PRESIDENT.

193
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,152
ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE

194
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,019
IMMIGRATION ISSUE.

195
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,554
YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE COURTS.

196
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,656
THE COURTS WILL NOT MATTER.

197
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:23,225
THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION WILL

198
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:24,326
NOT MATTER.

199
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,861
IF IMMIGRATION CHANGES THIS

200
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,662
COUNTRY ENOUGH THAT WE CAN NEVER

201
00:07:27,663 --> 00:00:00,000
GET ANOTHER REPUBLICAN
