SINGAPORE SUMMIT.

7
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:26,007
WHAT DO THESE TOXIC KNOW FOR THE

00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:26,641

GENERAL ANTHONY TATUM.

15
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:44,459
WE APPRECIATE IT.

16
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:49,531
THIS IS THE HIGHEST-RANKING

17
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,232
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL THAT

18
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:51,566
NATION TO VISIT THE US SINCE THE

19
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:56,238
YEAR 2000.

20
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,540
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS?

21
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,378
>> ALMOST EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT AS

22
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:04,012
SECRETARY POMPEO GOING TO

23
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:10,252
PYONGYANG AND A SHOW OF REAL

24
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:15,724
SERIOUSNESS, AND NOT THE ONLY

25
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:22,664
MEETING TAKING PLACE, AND THE

26
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:27,235
DEMILITARIZED ZONE DISCUSSING

27
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:28,236

00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:28,903
DENUCLEARIZATION AND OTHER

29
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:31,973
MEETINGS IN SINGAPORE WORKING

30
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:35,443

31
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:36,077
THREE MEETINGS, SECRETARY

32
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:36,711
POMPEO, THE HIGHEST LEVEL

33
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:39,247
MEETING AND PROBABLY THE MOST

34
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:45,253
IMPORTANT AND ALL OF THAT WILL

35
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:46,254
BE COMMUNICATED DURING THAT --

36
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:51,559
TO DONALD TRUMP.

37
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,260
WHAT THE MEETING IS ABOUT IS

38
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,994
SIGNALING A GO OR NO GO DECISION

39
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:53,495
TO THE PRESIDENT.

40
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:54,262
HE IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER

41
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:57,599
OR NOT NORTH KOREANS ARE READY

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,904
TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND

43
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:03,338
DENUCLEARIZE.

44
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:04,039
>> WHETHER THEY ARE SERIOUS,

45
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,275
DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOWN HE IS

46
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,243
READY TO STEP AWAY FROM IT IF

47
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:08,943
THEY DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON

48
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:13,448
WHAT HE BELIEVES THEY NEED TO DO

49
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:14,249
IN TERMS OF DENUCLEARIZATION

50
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:14,949
LOSE THEIR DINNER WAS STEAK,

51
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:20,255
CORN AND CHEESE.

52
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:20,955
WE WILL SEE HOW THEY GO WITH

53
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:21,256
THAT.

54
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:27,362
WHEN IN TERMS OF OPTIONS DOES

55
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:28,430
NORTH KOREA HAVE IN TERMS OF

56
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,964
DENUCLEARIZATION?

57
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:30,699
CAN WE GO THROUGH SOME OF THE

58
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,433
OPTIONS, POSSIBILITIES AND BEGIN

59
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:37,238
WITH HANDING OVER SOME NUCLEAR

60
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:42,744
WEAPONS AND HE MENTIONED LIBYA

61
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:43,411
BECAUSE OF HANDING OVER THE

62
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,245
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN ADVANCE.

63
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:50,151
>> LIBYA OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY,

64
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:50,785
AND CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.

65
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:52,687
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEND THE WRONG

66
00:02:52,687 --> 00:03:00,528
SIGNAL WITH WHOM YOU ARE

67
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:00,929
NEGOTIATING.

68
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:01,663
THERE IS NO OTHER COUNTRY LIKE

69
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:02,397
NORTH KOREA, THE HERMIT KINGDOM.

70
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:04,432
THEY TESTED 6 NUCLEAR WEAPONS,

71
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:06,234
THEY HAVE PRETTY EXTENSIVE

72
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:08,236
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC

73
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:08,837
MISSILE CAPABILITY VERY

74
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:09,404
DIFFERENT FROM LIBYA.

75
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:13,241
THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

76
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:14,275
IMMEDIATELY TURN OVER SOME NUKES

77
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:17,979
RIGHT AWAY, TAKE A PHASED

78
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:26,254
APPROACH, THEN FREEZE ALL

79
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:26,588
TESTING.

80
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:27,255
THROUGH THE PHASED APPROACH

81
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:28,256
CONTINUE TO DENUCLEARIZE AND

82
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:28,957
ALLOW TRANSPARENT INSPECTIONS

83
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,258
AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK POMPEO

84
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,327
TALKS ARE ALL ABOUT RIGHT NOW

85
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:35,263
AND IT IS WISE OF THE PRES. TO

86
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:38,266
HAVE THESE TALKS GOING ON RIGHT

87
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:42,270
NOW AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.

88
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,240
KIM JONG UN WAS RUMORED TO BE

89
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,642
EDUCATED IN THE WEST, IN

90
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:51,312
SWITZERLAND AND CAME TO POWER

91
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:51,813
WITH TWO VISIONS.

92
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:54,249
ONE IS A POWERFUL NUCLEAR

93
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:57,752
ARSENAL.

94
00:03:57,752 --> 00:03:58,453
THE OTHER IS A MIGHTY ECONOMY.

95
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:02,557
HE DOES NOT HAVE EITHER BUT HE

96
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:03,224
MAY BE WILLING TO TRADE THE

97
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:06,194
NUCLEAR ARSENAL TO ENHANCE THE

98
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:06,528
ECONOMY.

99
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,764
THE SAME PEOPLE, MANY FAMILIES

100
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:13,868
ARE DIVIDED BY THE 38TH

101
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:14,502
PARALLEL.

102
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:15,203
THE SAME WORK ETHIC IS IN THE

103
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:20,308
NORTH AS THE SOUTH BUT THEY NEED

104
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:20,809
PROPER LEADERSHIP.

105
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:21,509
HEATHER: OBVIOUSLY WE LEARNED

106
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:22,243
THE LESSON WITH IRAN, WE ARE NOT

107
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:26,948
GOING TO PUT A LOT OF MONEY UP

108
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:27,248
FRONT.

109
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:28,249
>> THE OPPORTUNITY IS WHAT YOU

110
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:32,320
REALLY HAVE IS A COUNTRY THAT

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,255
NEEDS MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE

112
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:34,656
DEVELOPMENT.

113
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:38,293
WHAT THE UNITED STATES CAN DO IS

114
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:45,333
SAY YOU CAME TO POWER WANTING

115
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,067
TWO THINGS, NUKES AND A STRONG

116
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:46,401
ECONOMY.

117
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,135
TAKE THE NUKES OFF, TRADE THAT

118
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:47,435
AWAY.

119
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:48,136
IT WILL HELP WITH YOUR STRONG

120
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:48,470
ECONOMY.

121
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,239
YOUR PARTNER TO THE SOUTH AND

122
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,340
THESE TALKS MAY BE ABOUT

123
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,241
REUNIFICATION.

124
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:56,244
IT IS A BIGGER PICTURE FOR ME

125
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:56,911
THAN JUST DENUCLEARIZATION.

126
00:04:56,911 --> 00:05:03,418
THERE IS A HOLISTIC DISCUSSION

127
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:03,952
ABOUT REUNIFICATION.

128
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:04,686
HEATHER: THAT BRINGS UP ANOTHER

129
00:05:04,686 --> 00:00:00,000
ISSUE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BRING
