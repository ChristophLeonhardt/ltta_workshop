00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:45,940
TO WHAT HE TOLD ME UNDER OATH

42
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:46,841

43
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:51,012

WE NEED TO FIND OUT FROM HER WHO

OPERATIONAL ROLES IN RESPECT TO

55
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:27,415
THE STEEL DOSSIER WASN'T

56
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,616
DISCLOSED BY THEM.

57
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:30,551
>> WHERE IS THE CRIME?

58
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:32,687
IS IT HER HUSBAND OR HER?

59
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,822
SHE DID THE RESEARCH THAT WAS

60
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:36,824
NEVER VERIFIED ON DONALD TRUMP

REPRESENTATIONS MADE.

69
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:56,377
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING THE

70
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,814
WARRANT TO SPY ON AN AMERICAN

71
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:00,148
CITIZEN.

72
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,950
IF THAT WAS DONE ON FALSE

73
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,252
PRETENSES WITH FALSE INFORMATION

74
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:07,021
THAT'S VIOLATING SOMEONES CIVIL

75
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:09,724
LIBERTIES UNDER COLOR OF LAW.

76
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:11,559
SO, THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TALK

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,096
TO NELLI OHR AND OTHERS TO

78
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:16,731
DETERMINE WHAT THE FBI KNEW,

79
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:18,332
WHEN THEY KNEW IT.

80
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,769
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

81
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,771
KNEW AND WHY THEY KNEW IT.

82
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,840
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS A

83
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,176
GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE FBI AND

84
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:29,577
DOJ THAT DIDN'T LIKE DONALD

85
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:29,877
TRUMP.

86
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,013
THEY DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE

87
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:32,380
PRESIDENT.

88
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,516
THEY TRIED TO STOP HIM.

89
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:38,386
>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S A FAIR

90
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:38,719
SUMMERY.

91
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,690
THE SAME FOLKS THAT PREJUDGED

92
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,960
HILLARY CLINTON'S INNOCENCE AND

93
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:47,462
PREJUDGED DONALD TRUMP'S GUILTY

94
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:49,897
ARE THE SAME NAMES AND FOLKS

95
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:52,333
WHO'S CONDUCT BE IN ISSUE OF

96
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,068
RESPECT TO HOW EVIDENCE WAS

97
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,470
PRESENTED OR NOT PRESENTED TO

98
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:56,370
THE COURT.

99
00:03:56,371 --> 00:04:00,308
>> YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT IS

100
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:02,143
THAT SOMEBODY WHO GAVE THE GREEN

101
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:04,679
LIGHT ON THE WARRANT BASED ON

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,714
THE UNVERIFIED INFORMATION.

103
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:09,750
THE SAME GUY WHO, WROTE A LETTER

104
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:13,588
TO HAVE JIM COMBY FIRE AND UPSET

105
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,523
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED HE WROTE

106
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:18,259
THE LETTER TO GET COMBY FIRED.

107
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,596
THE SAME GUY RUNNING THE DOJ

108
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,630
TODAY SITTING ON DOCUMENTS THAT

109
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:25,266
YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE

110
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,234
BEEN ASKING FOR.

111
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:30,204
THIS IS THE SAME INDIVIDUAL

112
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:33,040
OVERSEEING THE ROBERT MUELLER

113
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,541
INVESTIGATION?

114
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,977
>> THE REASON FOR THAT, MARIA,

115
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:38,312
IS JEFF SESSIONS HASN'T POINTED

116
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:41,749
ASPECIAL -- A SPECIAL COUNCIL.

117
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,886
THINK ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY

118
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:46,521
CIRCUMSTANCE YOU JUST DESCRIBED.

119
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:50,057
THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

120
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:52,460
JUSTICE ROD ROSENSTEIN IN DIRECT

121
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:53,794
CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER.

122
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,430
EACH ACCUSING ONE ANOTHER OF NOT

123
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:59,567
TELLING THE TRUTH IN REGARDS TO

124
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,602
IF SOMEONE WANTED TO RECORD THE

125
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:03,804
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

126
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,940
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A SPECIAL

127
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:06,841
COUNCIL PROVISION.

128
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:09,176
THEY CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO

129
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:10,912
INVESTIGATE THE MATTER WHEN THE

130
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:13,247
HEADS OF BOTH OF THOSE

131
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:15,049
COMPONENTS ARE IN DIRECT

132
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,416
CONFLICT.

133
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,684
THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIAL

134
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,519
COUNCIL SO WE CAN GET ANSWERS TO

135
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,787
THE QUESTIONS.

136
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:21,556
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF STRATEGY

137
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:22,924
GOING ON.

138
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,593
THERE WAS A MEDIA LEAK STRATEGY.

139
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,828
LET'S LEAK STUFF TO THE MEDIA SO

140
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,263
THEY COULD START TALKING ABOUT

141
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:30,665
IT AND THEY DID.

142
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,869
THERE WERE INFORMANTS INVOLVED.

143
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,204
THERE WAS A STRATEGY TO TAKE

144
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:38,639
DONALD TRUMP DOWN.

145
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,174
WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT

146
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,876
DECLASSIFY THE DOCUMENTS SO THE

147
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:42,910
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN CLEARLY

148
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,645
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED HERE

149
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,247
RATHER THEN HAVING A HINT OF

150
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:50,685
DONALD TRUMP HAD ANYTHING TO DO

151
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,186
WITH IT?

152
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,220
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION FOR

153
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:55,556
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

154
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:55,890
STATES.

155
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,792
HERE IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU.

156
00:05:57,793 --> 00:06:00,828
ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS THEY ARE

157
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:04,732
SEEKING -- SEEKING TO DECLASSIFY

158
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:05,900
I HAVE SEEN THEM.

159
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,836
I CAN TELL YOU AS A FORMER

160
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:14,075
FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IT WOULDN'T

161
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,611
EXPOSE NATIONAL SECURITY

162
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:17,011
INFORMATION.

163
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,747
IT WOULD EXPOSE CERTAIN FOLKS AT

164
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:22,383
THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

165
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:31,559
FBI AND THEIR ACTIONS AND

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,429
ACTIONS TAKEN TO CONCEAL CERTAIN

167
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,830
INFORMATION.

168
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:39,166
THE UNDERLINE PRETEXT TO THE

169
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,302
ENTIRE TRUMP/RUSSIA

170
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:47,875
INVESTIGATION IS THE IDEA THAT

171
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,911
GEORGE HAD A MEETING WITH A

172
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,413
DIPLOMAT ABOUT GETTING E-MAILS

173
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:53,447
FROM THE RUSSIAN.

174
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:56,083
IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR

175
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:59,954
FBI HAS ANOTHER PEACE

176
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:00,421
FBI HAS ANOTHER PIECE OF

177
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:04,792
EVIDENCE THAT GOES AGAINST THAT

178
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:06,927
THEY WOULD PRESENT BOTH SIDES OF

179
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,929
THE COIN TO EVALUATE THE WEIGHT

180
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,766
AND SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE.

181
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,268
INSTEAD, WHAT HAPPENED HERE, THE

182
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,737
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FBI

183
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:18,539
OFFICIALS IN OCTOBER OF 2016

184
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,374
ONLY PRESENTED TO THE COURT THE

185
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,610
EVIDENCE THAT MADE THE

186
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,911
GOVERNMENT'S CASE GET A WARRANT

187
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:27,181
TO SPY ON A TRUMP CAMPAIGN

188
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:29,283
ASSOCIATE.

189
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,419
DECLASSIFICATION WOULD

190
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,688
CORROBORATE WHAT I JUST RELATED

00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:34,522

INVESTIGATION HAVING ANY

194
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:39,627
CREDIBILITY IF HE'S NOT ACTUALLY

195
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:43,364
LOOKING AT WHO DID COLLUDE OR

196
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,332
WORK WITH THE RUSSIAN?

197
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:49,336
>> THAT ISSUE, I WOULD ADVOCATE

198
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:51,472
FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL

199
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:54,709

>> I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE

203
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:00,347
MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS GOING.

204
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,516
>> WHERE IT'S GOING IS IT'S

205
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:03,451
WINDING DOWN.

206
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:06,554
I'VE WATCHED CLOSELY WHAT'S BEEN

207
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:06,921
HAPPENING.

208
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,689
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE OFFICE

209
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,225
IS DOING IT'S STAFFING DOWN.

210
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:13,060
FOLKS WORKING ARE LEAVING AND

211
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:15,863
GOING BACK TO THE OFFICES FROM

THEY ARE OUT SOURCING AND

214
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:22,670
DELEGATING MATTERS BACK TO

COMPONENT AGENCY OR COMPARTMENTS

216
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,907
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

217
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,509
AND U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

218
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,147
THAT SIGNALS A WINDING DOWN AND

219
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:35,516
THEY WILL ACCEPT WRITTEN ANSWERS

220
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:37,451
FROM DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS ON

221
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:40,654

COLLUSION WITH ANYONE FROM THE

226
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:52,233
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

BOB MUELLER MIGHT HAVE SOME
