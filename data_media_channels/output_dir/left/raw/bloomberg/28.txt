00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,900
When David Beckham visited the Amazon in 2016

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,920
he said  it was one of the only places in the world he hadn't been recognized.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,440
And that's pretty unusual for someone who gets this type of reception almost everywhere he goes.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,060
To play soccer, like David Beckham

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,760
This is the story of how David Beckham became one of the most recognizable brands in the world.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,140
Even though he retired from soccer five years ago, David Beckham's image is still as powerful  as ever.

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,640
The Beckhams have an estimated net worth of $450 million,

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,000
but more than that they have an influence most brands dream of.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,800
I don't think we could understate how many times we've seen David Beckham's image and

10
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:53,710
how much, by sheer repetition, it's been printed on our minds.

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,989
Robert Williams is Bloomberg's luxury and
retail reporter based in Paris.

12
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,380
From airport billboards to TV commercials to glossy magazine ads,

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,000
it's just an effect of recognisability that's been built up over the years.

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,979
People assume that I've got so many brands, but I actually haven't.

15
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,659
We've got quite a few.

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,880
Those few make up a wide base of products and partnerships

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,760
including whisky, watches,  charities and more.

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,740
The other thing to say about Brand Beckham is that it is very much a phenomenon of its time.

19
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,830
Andy Milligan is a brand consultant who wrote the book on Brand Beckham.

20
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:37,359
Celebrities can become brands in a very potent way, sometimes in a more meaningful and relevant way

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,100
than traditional products because
at the heart of a personality brand

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,439
there is a human story which is constantly fascinating and evolving.

23
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,390
And Beckham isn't just selling himself, his
whole family is part of the story.

24
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,040
Victoria Beckham has created a critically
acclaimed luxury fashion label.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,840
In 2017 she received a $40 million investment from a former Goldman Sachs banker,

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,220
valuing the business at around $130 million.

27
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,220
Victoria set the pace for this couple and
really positioning herself as an entrepreneur

28
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,220
and not just as a model or someone who does endorsements.

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,430
The Beckham children are part of the brand too.

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,240
As well as modelling contracts and book deals, each child's name is trademarked

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,420
which means only the Beckham's can use their names on products.

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,430
All of this is a contrast to David Beckham's own modest childhood growing up in east London.

33
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,040
Though never compared to the likes of Pelé or Maradona,

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,820
it was Beckham’s drive which made him stand out early on.

35
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,820
He went and got for himself one of the most prestigious sports marketing companies,

36
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,000
whose clients in those days included people like Alan Shearer and Michael Owen, very high profile  footballers.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,360
He got them at an early stage in his life
and I think that was the first sign of intent.

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,540
And like all good success stories, timing
was key.

39
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,480
Beckham made his league debut for Manchester United when he was 19.

40
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,170
Just a few years earlier the establishment
of the English Premier League had created

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,460
a significant increase in viewership both
at home and abroad.

42
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,870
He just happened to be the right man at the right time.

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,340
If he'd been in football even 10 years earlier, I'm sure he would have been successful but

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,500
he wouldn't have had nowhere near the opportunities
to make such an impact as he did during the '90s.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,780
Beckham quickly realized he could create value with his image.

46
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,400
In 2002 when asked why contract negotiations
were taking so long, he put it down to one

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,560
thing - image rights - payments made by the
club for the right to use anything related

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,420
to the Beckham brand - his name, face, even the way he kicked a ball.

49
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,520
While he wasn't the first footballer to receive
such payments, the earnings were significant

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,010
and alongside his endorsements made him
the world’s highest paid soccer player.

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,170
Photographer: David just to your left.

52
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,460
This was all part of what Andy calls the "earn
till you burn" model.

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,330
Trying to bank as much money as possible before
retirement.

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,560
His first deal with hairstyling brand Brylcreem
was worth £1 million

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,300
and created a 50% surge in sales.

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,660
Photographer: Sit up straight, David.

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,660
[Laughs]

58
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,000
This was followed by deals with more global
brands like Pepsi, Adidas and Gillette.

59
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,080
Unlike other footballers he also extended
his image beyond the pitch too - including

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,680
a £20 million deal with Armani in 2007 which
attracted a great deal of attention.

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,140
It is a rare man who can be that tough on
the field and also have his own line of underwear.

62
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,140
[Laughs]

63
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:27,900
He took a big risk early in his career by
showing his interest in fashion, his willingness

64
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,100
to be a bit daring with his look at a time

65
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,560
when that wasn't necessarily attached to masculine role models.

66
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,720
It's not something that athletes were willing
to risk their image on before.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,280
It’s come down to three consistent things
through which the Beckham brand is delivered.

68
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,320
It's football, it's fashion, and I'd call
it, it's feel good

69
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,040
but he takes risks inside those.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,100
The risks seems to have paid off.

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,220
A couple of years after his retirement, Beckham
earned £45 million.

72
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,820
That was more than 13 times as much as he was
paid in his last year as a footballer and

73
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,900
more than any former athlete in the world
apart from Michael Jordan.

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,840
But football is still the focus.

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,900
It’s been confirmed that David Beckham is
to start a soccer franchise in Miami.

76
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,620
During his move to LA Galaxy in 2007 his contract
included the option for him to buy a

77
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,560
Major League Soccer team for $25 million at the
end of his career.

78
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,440
A smart deal sweetener now that expansion
teams cost six times that.

79
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,020
Today you made my dream come true.

80
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,580
And all of this secures Beckham's brand exposure
in soccer and the US for the foreseeable future.

81
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,600
There's a legacy being built there that will
survive David Beckham, and actually that is

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,880
the ultimate testament to the way he's thinking,
and indeed, to the way that really good brands

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,800
and brand owners think.

84
00:05:47,800 --> 00:00:00,000
Proof perhaps that this is a brand that relies
on more than just a pretty face.
