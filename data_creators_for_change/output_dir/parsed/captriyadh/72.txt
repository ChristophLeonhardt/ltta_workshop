hi i'm riyadh today i'm gonna be showing
you how to get that Justin Bieber
haircut from his what do you mean video
the goal in this is to appear as though
your hairdresser doesn't give a
about you or their job that they decided
to stop and walk out of the salon
halfway through cutting your hair okay
so the first thing you're gonna need are
the shittest and cheapest hair
extensions that you can find to get that
great one at natural look into your
extensions
I advise taping them to the back of your
car and driving for about two and a half
hours place them into your scalp so far
that just a tiny bit of blood comes out
push you're almost there
oh some debris forget now when it comes
to products my personal preference is
all-natural stay hydrated now you're
gonna want it to end just about where
your mouth is the more Radames
- better at this point if you want to
add any additional products that's
totally fine I recommend this one I
swear by this one love it back combing
is key I usually go for this guy here
it's the barbecue grill extreme mm looks
just like eating rust coming off this so
it's gonna add a really nice warm effect
to the hair so you just to grab it and
you just want to be like as aggressive
as physically possible
well do it as if you're like pleasuring
someone just go go go go go go go
perfect you're still looking like you
care too much at this point I recommend
just like you know a normal lighter you
just sort of like yeah just like that
that's perfect okay so the hair is on
point but this is not the end of the
look I haven't got a tattoo gun but this
will do and he does have one that's like
down here it's like a line of a
little bit more right here
thank you for watching subscribe and
I'll be back with another how-to guide
until then enjoy me as the one the only
Justin Bieber sure
