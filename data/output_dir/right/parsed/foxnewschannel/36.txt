>> Bill: REACTION FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE.
READ THE SARAH SANDERS'
STATEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE CONDEMN THE ATTEMPTED
VIOLENT ATTACKS MADE AGAINST
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SECRETARY
CLINTON AND OTHER PUBLIC
FIGURES.
ANYONE RESPONSIBLE WILL BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT OF THE LAW.
THE UNITED STATES SECRET
SERVICE AND OTHER LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE
INVESTIGATING AND WILL TAKE ALL
APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO PROTECT
ANYONE THREATENED BY THESE
COWARDS.
WANT TO BRING IN MICHAEL,
FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY MEMBER.
WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION WHAT
YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE POST
OFFICE FINDING THIS FIRST.
>> THE CONCERN ABOUT THE POST
OFFICE IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW THIS BUT THE POST
OFFICE DOES NOT SCREEN FOR
EXPLOSIVES.
THEY HAVE BIOLOGICAL WEAPON
SCREENING CAPABILITIES BUT THEY
REALLY DON'T SCREEN FOR
EXPLOSIVES.
YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP FROM
OTHER SOURCES TO PREVENT IT
LIKE THE SECRET SERVICE OR
ROUTINE SCREENING THAT AN
INDIVIDUAL MIGHT DO.
THE SECOND ASPECT, THOUGH, IS
THAT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE
STAMPS ON THE PACKAGE, YOU
MIGHT HAVE A ROADMAP TO WHERE
THE INDIVIDUAL TRIED TO MAIL
THESE THINGS.
THE INFORMATION I'M RECEIVING
ABOUT THE DEVICE IS THAT THEY
WERE CRUDE BUT REAL.
THIS WAS NOT A PHONY -- THESE
WERE NOT PHONY DEVICES.
THEY DIDN'T DETONATE.
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS ABOUT
FUNCTIONALITY.
ALSO HEARD SOME DESCRIPTIONS
ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY NOT
QUITE BEING WHAT YOU NEED IT TO
DO TO DETONATE THESE THINGS.
BUT EACH TIME THAT YOU HAVE
THESE TYPES OF DEVICES IT IS A
SIGNATURE.
THE WAY THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER,
THE MATERIALS THEY WERE
CONSTRUCTED OUT OF, THE TIMING.
ALL THESE THINGS ARE VERY
IMPORTANT AND TO LEAD
INVESTIGATORS BACK TO WHO MIGHT
HAVE SENT THESE THINGS.
>> Sandra: THAT'S IMPORTANT
CONSIDERING WE'RE LEARNING
ABOUT THESE DEVICES JUST ONE
DAY AFTER THE BOMB WAS FOUND IN
GEORGE SOROS'S MAILBOX.
YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THEY'LL
BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THESE
DEVICES AND POTENTIALLY TIE
TOGETHER, IF THERE IS A TIE, TO
WHO DID THESE AND WHO MADE
THESE AND POTENTIALLY PUT THEM
IN PLACE.
THAT BEING SAID, IT'S TOUGH TO
TRY TO DECIPHER BETWEEN THE
DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES THAT ARE
RELEASING INFORMATION ON THIS
WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT.
THE SECRET SERVICE IN THEIR
STATEMENT CALLED THESE
POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES CERTAINLY.
ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS VIA
THE A.P. THEY'RE CALLING THESE
FUNCTIONAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.
WERE THEY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES IS
WHAT YOU'RE CONFIRMING?
>> THEY WERE, IN FACT
FUNCTIONAL.
THEY DIDN'T WORK OR DETONATE
BECAUSE OF A PARTICULAR FLAW
THAT WAS IN THE DESIGN OF IT
WHEN THEY PUT IT TOGETHER.
THAT INFORMATION WILL CONTINUE
COMING AND WILL BE THE FOCUS OF
INVESTIGATORS.
BUT THIS TAKES US BACK AND
REMINDS US OF THE TED KOEZ
INSKI ATTACK THAT LASTED FROM
1978 TO 1995.
HE HAD MAILED -- USED THE MAIL
AS A DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR HIS
DEVICES BUT HE WAS ULTIMATELY
FOUND BUT AFTER A VERY LONG
PERIOD OF TIME.
WHICH INDICATES THAT THE
INVESTIGATION COULD GO ON A
WHILE.
THIS MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING
THAT WITHIN THE NEXT DAY OR SO
WE'LL SEE.
THE OTHER THING THAT YOU SHOULD
PAY ATTENTION TO IS THAT THE
SOURCES TALKING TO ME SAY THIS
COULD BE SOMETHING MORE
WIDESPREAD.
THESE THREE PACKAGES MIGHT NOT
BE ALL.
>> Sandra: I WANT TO GET
BREAKING NEWS IN.
THE CNN BUREAU IN NEW YORK CITY
HAVE BEEN EVACUATED.
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW ON THAT.
THE TIME WARNER CENTER WE WERE
ALSO TOLD HAS BEEN EVACUATED IN
RECENT MOMENTS.
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW AS WE CONTINUE TO
LEARN MORE,  MICHAEL.
>> THE BOMB SQUAD WAS ON ITS
WAY TO TIME WARNER CENTER WHEN
I WAS ON MY WAY HERE.
I SAW THE VEHICLES GOING BY
WITH SIRENS.
IF IT'S MEDIA OUTLETS AND
INDIVIDUALS HIGH PROFILE THIS
IS A CONCERTED EFFORT TO DO A
WIDE-BASED DISTRIBUTION OF
THESE DEVICES.
>> Bill: HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE, HOW
WOULD SOMEBODY WORKING IN A
POST OFFICE FIND THIS?
>> IT WOULD BE BY THE BOX
ITSELF.
IN OTHER WORDS, LOOKED LIKE A
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE.
AS I SAID BEFORE, THE POST
OFFICE DOES NOT SCREEN FOR
EXPLOSIVE.
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY DO.
BUT THEY DON'T.
IF YOU HAD A BOX -- WHAT
HAPPENS IF THERE IS A WIRE
STICKING OUT OR DEPENDING WHAT
TYPE OF DEVICE, WHAT TYPE OF
MATERIAL IS USED, THERE COULD
BE SOME TYPE OF OIL THAT SEEPS
THROUGH THE PACKAGE.
THESE ARE TYPICAL INDICATORS
THAT THE DEVICE MIGHT -- THAT A
PACKAGE MIGHT CONTAIN A DEVICE
AND IT IS WHEN YOU DO MAIL
SCREENING THESE ARE SOME OF THE
SIGNS THAT YOU LOOK FOR WHEN
YOU TAKE -- IN THE PACKAGE.
>> Sandra: WHAT DOES THE
INVESTIGATION LOOK LIKE, WOULD
YOU BE ABLE TO GIVE US AN IDEA
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THIS MOMENT
AS WE LEARN AND TO REPORT AGAIN
CNN STUDIOS IN NEW YORK CITY
EVACUATED, TIME WARNER CENTER
HAS BEEN EVACUATED, TWO
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES FOUND, ONE AT
THE HOME OF THE FORMER
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IN
WASHINGTON AND ONE AT THE HOME
IN CHAPPAQUA OF BILL AND
HILLARY CLINTON.
NEITHER OF THESE DEVICES WERE
RECEIVED BY THE OBAMAS OR THE
CLINTONS.
SECRET SERVICE IS SAYING A FULL
SCOPE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS
NOW BEING TAKEN.
THEY'RE USING STATE, FEDERAL
AND LOCAL RESOURCES TO
DETERMINE WHAT THEY CAN.
WHAT DOES THE INVESTIGATION
LOOK LIKE AT THIS MOMENT?
>> RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU HAVE A
SUSPECTED PACKAGE YOU WANT TO
SECURE THE FACILITY, MAKE SURE
THAT PACKAGE IS RENDERED SAFE
AND THEN THAT'S WHY YOU'LL HAVE
THE BOMB TEAMS THAT WILL GO TO
A LARGE FACILITY LIKE THE TIME
WARNER CENTER.
THERE IS GREAT SECURITY, SAME
WITH THE OTHER FACILITY.
BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THE
INITIAL CONCERNS AS YOU ALL
KNOW, WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS A
LONG TIME, YOU AND I, THESE
FACTS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME.
WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION.
SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH
PACKAGES WERE DELIVERED BY
MAIL, WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN
PLACED.
TED PLACED SOME DEVICES
PERSONALLY.
WHAT THE INVESTIGATION WILL DO
FIRST, GO TALK TO THE MAILMAN
AND POSTAL SERVICE AND GET A
TIMELINE WHEN THE DELIVERY CAME.
HOW DID IT GET TO THE FACILITY?
WHAT TRUCK WAS IT IN?
WHAT TYPE OF STAMPS WERE ON IT?
AND TRACE IT BACK TO WHERE IT
MIGHT HAVE COME AND WHO MIGHT
HAVE DEDEPOSITED THE POST
OFFICE BOX.
WITH ALL THE CAMERAS YOU CAN
TELL WHEN SOMEONE WENT AND
POSSIBLY PUT IT INTO THE
DELIVERY SYSTEM.
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS
THEY'LL DO RIGHT NOW AND OF
COURSE AS SOON AS THEY FIND ANY
TYPE OF ORIGINATION THEY'LL
BLANKET THAT AREA AND TRY TO
SEE WHO SAW SOMEONE WALK IN
WITH A PACKAGE LOOKING LIKE
THIS.
SO THAT'S -- WE'RE NOW GOING TO
SEE PICTURES OF THE PACKAGE
ITSELF TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN
