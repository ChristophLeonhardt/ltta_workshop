for Russia the World Cup is a chance to show its best face to the world but parts of the British media are working hard to dig up negative stories about the country wherever they can find them the Sun newspaper published this article titled Russia in the raw hopelessness desperation and crushing poverty here's one of the accompanying images showing two women relaxing on their work break there are also pictures of homeless people and alcoholics the images were taken by a Russian photographer and aid volunteer who often travels around the country here are some of his other work from the same Instagram page which the son chose not to use as you can see the photos capture a wide variety of scenes showing everyday life in Russia we spoke with the photographer he says the newspaper cherry picked his images to fit their own storyline which had very little to do with the truth and also that they mislead him about their intentions a few days ago I received a letter from the some newspaper over a story about my photos and my work from time to time I get offers like this from local and international outlets I didn't know at the time what this particular outlet was so I thought it was interesting so I wrote let's discuss this they originally offered to write about my work I work with multiple humanitarian organizations in many of them as a volunteer and about a third of my Instagram consists of pictures taken during my work with different institutions after that those who contacted me disappeared and in a couple of days people started sending me links to a story where a weird selection of social storylines had been mixed with a dumb commentary on the World Cup I got angry wrote to them demanding that the story was deleted they later sent me a letter where they requested permission to use the photos I didn't give any but that did not stop them at first they offered to fix it and they offered money but only when I threatened the lawsuit did they delete it but as far as I understand those hours of useless conversations where they tried to offer me some 250 pounds were aimed at using traffic they got in that time I work with multiple charities i film different socially important stories I don't think they're a subject of speculation by any our channel has requested a comment from the sauna on the matter we'll bring you the response when we hearing him you
