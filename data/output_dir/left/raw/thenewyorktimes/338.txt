1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,090
Tonight I call upon all of us
to set aside our differences,

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,060
to seek out common ground
and to summon the unity

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,510
we need to deliver
for the people ... .

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,590
All of us together as one
team, one people

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,083
and one American family
can do anything.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,940
We face rogue regimes, terrorist
groups and rivals like China

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,220
and Russia that challenge
our interests,

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,687
our economy and our values.

9
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,060
Struggling communities,
especially immigrant communities,

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,800
will also be helped
by immigration policies

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,670
that focus on the best interests
of American workers

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,922
and American families.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,800
We must modernize and rebuild
our nuclear arsenal,

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,950
hopefully never having to use it. ...

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,780
Perhaps someday
in the future, there

16
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,100
will be a magical moment
when the countries of the world

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:00:00,000
will get together to eliminate
their nuclear weapons.
