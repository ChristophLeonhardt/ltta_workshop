1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,810
sir President Trump again attacked the
press last night trying to blame the

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,160
media for his own controversial comments
on Charlotte's bill as you are about to

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,269
hear for many of his most die-hard
supporters those attacks on the press

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,410
are making a lasting impression on
Monday I sat down with a group of Trump

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,340
voters from Florida Pennsylvania
Michigan Alabama and Georgia to get

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,390
their take and they have very strong
opinions about who was to blame for

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,050
violence in Charlottesville and where
they go to get their information how

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,520
many of you show of hands were troubled
by the president's response to the

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:46,980
violence in Charlottesville none of you
minded how President Trump responded no

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,550
yeah why did anything wrong with it I
mean he addressed a problem I mean let's

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,370
face reality there are problems on both
sides do you think that neo-nazis and

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,629
white supremacists are the same as those
who are protesting them I think it's

13
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,040
ridiculous to have me choose between
Hitler and Stalin which is what I

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,659
consider both groups are and why are the
people who turned out to protest Nazis

15
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,630
now I make sahlan to you the entire
group to me is totally a very stylish

16
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,360
kind of group ha
everyone have set fires and burn players

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,540
to the ground that doesn't sound like a
very peaceful group to me they did are

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,500
both the same evil they didn't use those
tactics in Charlottesville so do not

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,180
blame the government why do you blame
the governor or the government for a

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,500
white supremacist mowing down a crowd of
people and killing someone because they

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,860
didn't protect the people that day the
people who were marching with the signs

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,310
do you see them as neo-nazis and white
supremacists

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,299
I mean it hasn't been investigated so we
really don't know who was out there but

24
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm telling you I've seen videos of
other people who were out there who were

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,579
not neo-nazis you believe that there
were very fine people protest I'll dude

26
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,969
how do you know that I'm only telling
you some videos that I've seen it but

27
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,320
what's the source of your videos where
you say Facebook and then when I tried

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,189
to repost those videos they wouldn't
allow me is it possible they're not

29
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,179
credible could be but like I said they
need to investigate and find out exactly

30
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,200
what was going on out there
vice did an investigation of the people

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,830
who went
there with a purpose to March for

32
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:40,520
neo-nazis so let me just play a clip so
blood and soil was a Nazi slogan and you

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,150
heard them saying Jews will not replace
us is it possible that very fine people

34
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:52,790
were in that crowd not an ecru so but
those where's those those crazy I don't

35
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,990
know what else to call them nycap I
can't say it on TV but they still have

36
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,510
the right to say those crazy things
that's the night before the clash happen

37
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,280
the anti-fog the protesters they didn't
show up Friday night they showed up

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,600
Saturday these protesters showed up the
second day they came there to do battle

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,130
with them they showed up with helmet
body armor clubs they showed up with

40
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,020
balloons filled with urine tests and
these guys showed up with automatic

41
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,100
weapon and meditative Virginia open
carry is legal you can walk down a carry

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,280
seems to me that you're getting these
guys a green light the why not why do

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,570
you seem more angry at anti-fur then at
the neo-nazis I'm not more angry it's

44
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,150
equal the media is not covering it
they're only focus on making neo-nazis

45
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,090
and white supremacist out to be Trump
supporters and they're the issue of the

46
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,440
problem the reality is of what Trump
said is there were two sides there are

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,830
two parties that participated he said
those trouble on both sides was there

48
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,010
not trouble on both sides and I saw best
on both sides I'm sure you've heard the

49
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,370
argument there was violence on both
sides of World War two also yeah we were

50
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,510
on the right side yes right side in the
wrong side no I'm not okay if there were

51
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,440
some people in Antipa okay but most of
them were students including CAD or

52
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,580
higher who was killed so why aren't you
got killed because they didn't protect

53
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:17,089
her who killed her um to be honest with
you I don't know because it hasn't been

54
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,659
investigated yet we haven't heard
anything with the suspect is like I

55
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,710
don't trust anything that the news media
serves anymore and the fact of the

56
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,880
matter is we haven't heard from this
young man

57
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,380
like when I first heard this to me
myself i'ma tell you what I some stuff

58
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,060
went to my mind I'm like maybe he had a
panic attack why are you giving him a

59
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,900
pass I'm not giving him a pass but the
wire you think that I why turning

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,280
premises 20 try to had a panic attack
how can you be a supremacist of anything

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,600
he's 20 years old he's being dead he's
going a roof we see all this with other

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,670
young white men there being aa premises
they're being led by devil I think we're

63
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,790
moving kind of further away from the
point of the view this conversation

64
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,910
should be what happened that day was a
tragedy and it should never have

65
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,450
happened to begin with no one here is
supporting the neo-nazis or the white

66
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,560
supremacist and that narrative is really
negative but what we are talking about

67
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,980
is president Trump's response and he
stood in front of America and he

68
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,100
condemned the violence that occurred
that day you're talking about three or

69
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,400
400 people in Charlottesville they
didn't do nothing

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,990
yeah they're 60 million people voted
them in president Trump why don't we get

71
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,850
us a those people aren't nothing y'all
Democrats have idiots Republicans have

72
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,380
idiots but we're talking about us the 60
million that for Trump we don't think

73
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,060
stuff like that why isn't it the easiest
thing in the world for the president to

74
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,860
say neo-nazis have no place in this
country shed whatever is right if I said

75
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,480
it was they didn't know mm doesn't
generally not a cynic it just happened I

76
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,470
think a great portion of it is a
conspiracy I think it was a setup come

77
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,600
home from home I think people who want
to derail our president and deal with

78
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,210
buses coming in with lots of young
people and protesters coming off the

79
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,940
same bus with some wearing black lives
matter and some wearing the KKK shirts

80
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,960
they were brought in to cause a
controversy right where are you getting

81
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,510
your evidence a lot of it on Facebook
you saw something on face yes yes yes

82
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,090
the protesters the anti five people had
an ad on Craigslist recruiting people

83
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,440
for $25 an hour to show up for the
protest in Charlottesville uh-huh it's

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,330
all over the place you can read the eye
and you try to Facebook more than news

85
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,270
organization oh yeah i video for people
who shot at our present yeah you trust

86
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,140

know the origin or thought or the people

87
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,540
are
burns even though you can't tell me the

88
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,800
source of these videos I can pull the
model of the bases on a deeper level the

89
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,290
same video ok show me what you found on
your phone Oh video as we did it often

90
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,850
Sparky there are videos on YouTube that
are on Facebook there are videos that if

91
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,790
you just google Charlotte post-show
Virginia protesters videos they start

92
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,690
they all start popping up into the feed
okay somebody I also have a young man

93
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,650
who said that they saw these people the
six buses lined up someone that lives in

94
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,520
Sean's room that the six buses were
lined up and people were getting off the

95
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,770
bus with KKK shirts on it and BLM
services right what now name that water

96
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,250
may not sound credible message while it
may not sound credible to a lot of

97
00:07:23,250 --> 00:00:00,000
people to us who don't trust the news
media and that could be very credible
