so let's move on to the big ask of Comey and that ask was that you know you make this Michael Flynn thing go away and Trump obviously wanted loyalty from Komine and so in the memos Comey kind of talked about what his reaction was to the demands for loyalty and he said the following I added that I was reliable in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term I explained that he could count on me to always tell the truth I said I don't do sneaky things I don't leak I don't do weasel moves so that was an interesting way of handling it because you know to your point no me when it came to the reporter thing he just kind of laughed it off when it came to asking for loyalty I mean right then and there Comey could have taken a stronger approach and said no I'm supposed to be independent of you I'm not going to just be loyal to you it doesn't work that way but he didn't he said I'm reliable and I think for someone like Trump you know he seems to have a hard time reading in between the lot and and that might have actually been an opening and yammy could have been stronger in that conversation but at the same time it was perhaps and I was thinking about this when I looked at the notes for the show perhaps it was when Comey literally thought you know what there's a choice or maybe Trump is actually I was thinking about being a president in the classical way that we sort of think of a president and maybe you know sort of doing the right thing as opposed to using all of us as his minions which is ultimately where he was going in that conversation you say no wait a minute I'm not that none of us are actually that I think was the implication but he didn't stop him in his tracks he sort of used other terms that were sort of a foreign language to de trop exactly yeah it was a lowly response but James Comey is a lawyer and he split the difference there he's like well I don't want him like hating me right from the get-go and this is in the beginning of their relationship at the same time I don't want to promise some things that are illegal I'm not gonna do that and that's he notes it in the memo at the time and I gotta tell you I don't think that it's that bad a cop and I'll give you a personal example and I don't know that it speaks well of me but when I was at MSNBC and we were talking about this recently a couple shows ago and so popped into my head you know the head of MSNBC Phil Griffin you know asked me to act more like the establishment and tone it down against the Democratic Party etc and I chose not to do that but in that meeting I didn't tell them Phil how dare you I will not do any such thing I I just you know I didn't say I definitely didn't say yes and I didn't say no I just in my head thought hell no and I went harder against the Democrats and against the establishment but I didn't say it in the meeting so to be fair to Comey you know he he compromised in the language but made it clear in his memos and clear enough if Trump was at any degree of intelligence that he wasn't just going to do whatever he asked him to do politically right so now here's another part of the memo while the president tried to urge Comey to let it go with Flynn apparently he also wasn't sure about the man he tasked with national security issues so apparently Trump had his own reservations about Michael Flynn so apparently he had told Comey according to the memos that he had some issues with Michael Flynn as well that he didn't trust his judgment which I think is interesting but then also simultaneously asked Comey to let the Michael Flynn thing go don't investigate him yeah that made me wonder Flynn has anything at all on Trump because if if Flynn had something on Trump I don't think Trump would be ambivalent about him and he'd probably come out roaring and be like no Flynn is awesome he's fantastic he's the best national security adviser anybody's ever had right and I would know because I'm a very stable genius so I mean that makes me think Flynn doesn't have much on Trump and and that makes sense cuz he's not a longtime ally like Michael Cohen but anyway these are contemporaneous notes and again you get a sense of authenticity here because at the time he wrote also some things that were in a sense positive about Trump yeah look I think it's just representative of how Trump views people in general he doesn't really see people as either good or bad he's just he sees people as potential targets potential victims of his own behavior and I mean by that is one moment he might love you but he'll turn on you in a second so with Michael Flynn I mean I'm sure he gave Co me all sorts of mixed signals or you know just mixed signals when it came to his own perception of Flynn what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you
