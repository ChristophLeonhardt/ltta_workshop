BRIAN: THANK YOU FOR THAT. MAXINE WATERS TURNS 80 YEARS YOUNG. CALIFORNIA LIBERAL REVEALING WHAT SHE WANTS FOR HER BIRTHDAY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I WILL STOP NOW. MY BIGGEST BIRTHDAY WISH WOULD BE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET A LEADER OF THIS COUNTRY WHO REPRESENTS US, WHO HAS THE RESPECT OF ALL OF OUR ALLIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE CONSTITUTION, SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT LIE. STEVE: WELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR TOMI LAHREN JOINS US NOW FROM OUT ON THE WEST COAST. TOMI, I THINK HE TOMI, I THINK SE TOMI, I THINK SHE IS TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND AS WE HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST YEAR SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM. WELL, I WAS HOPING SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HERSELF APPRECIATION FOR THE CONSTITUTION. BUT, LISTEN, IF AND WHEN TRUMP DE RANGEMENT SYNDROME IS PUT IN THE DICTIONARY THERE WILL BE A PHOTO OF MAXINE WATERS NEXT THOUGH THAT DESCRIPTION. THE REASON SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE REMOVE OF FOR HER CONSTITUENTS, FOR CALIFORNIA. SHE SIMPLY HAS TO BE ANTI-TRUMP BECAUSE THAT IS HER SCHTICK AND SHE HAS NOTHING ELSE TO SAY. WELL, WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA. I MEAN, THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO FIX IN THIS STATE AND I'M HOPING WHEN WE HAVE ELECTIONS ROLL AROUND WE CAN START TO FIX THOSE THINGS LITTLE BY LITTLE. IT'S GOING TO BE AN UPHILL BATTLE AS I KNOW FROM LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE MORE THAT SHE REMOVING DONALD TRUMP, JUST BEING OVERALL ANTI-TRUMP, I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO START TO LOSE SUPPORT. BECAUSE EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL WANT TO HEAR POLICY ITEMS AND AGENDA ITEMS TO BETTER THIS COUNTRY, BETTER THE DISTRICT AND IF SHE IS JUST SIMPLY ANTI-TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HOLD YOU THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO WORK? IT'S JUST RESIST, RESIST, RESIST. DON'T PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT POLICY. I BELIEVE THAT THEY DO. OF COURSE, THERE ARE SOME AREAS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE RESIST MESSAGE IS VERY POPULAR. I SEE IT ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT, LIKE I HAVE TOLD YOU GUYS SOME TIMES JUST FROM LIVING IN CALIFORNIA FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW, CAN I SEE THINGS STARTING TO CHANGE. CAN I SEE INDIVIDUALS TIRED OF THE HOMELESSNESS, TIRED THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE MORE THAN JUST ANTI-TRUMP. STARTING WITH CRAZY MAXINE WATERS. OF THE HIGH TAXES I IMAGINE. LET'S TALK ABOUT MILLENNIAL WOMEN. THEY HAVE A DEFINITE FEELING THE MOST DEMOCRAT FEMALES OVER THE NEXT GENERATION, 63% SAY THEY ARE FEMINIST. A TOTAL OF 46% OVERALL WHEN YOU FACTOR IN INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? WELL, THIS ISN'T SURPRISING TO ME BECAUSE I KNOW MANY MILLENNIAL WOMEN WHO THOUGH THEY BELIEVE IN FEMALE EMPOWERMENT AND ANYMORE. MODERN DAY THEM NISTS HORRIFIED ABOUT AND ROLL IN THEIR GRAVES WHAT THE FEMINISTS HAVE DONE ABOUT THE MOVEMENT. SPECIAL TREATMENT. THE STREETS GETTING ATTENTION WITH HATS AND BEING ANTI-TRUMP. IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT LIFTING UP WOMEN. EMPOWERING WOMEN. IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO EMPOWER WOMEN WHO ARE CONSERVATIVE WOMEN AND AS WE HAVE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING BUT THAT THE FEMINISTS HAVE NOT COME OUT TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIKE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, LIKE KIRSTJEN NIELSEN LIKE THE REST OF THE WOMEN IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHO HAVE ASCENDED TO VERY HIGH POSITIONS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. ALL THEY HAVE DONE IS DEMEAN THESE WOMEN. SO THAT'S WHY I THINK WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF MILLENNIAL WOMEN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT? STEVE: THAT'S FROM A BRAND
