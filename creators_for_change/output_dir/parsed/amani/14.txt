what's up family I haven't vlogged in a
minute so I thought today's gonna be a
really fun day
why not vlog it out right now we are
currently on our way to the Grove
Australia in New York City which I'm
super excited about this is the first
girlboss trolley that's actually in New
York there's only the second girlboss
trolley period so I'm super excited to
take part and it means a little
something special to me because I read
Sophia Amoruso this book girl boss
before Muslim girl became a company back
when I was living in DC at my
nine-to-five and it was really
inspirational for me I really enjoyed it
too the fact that two years later now
I'm a girl boss and I got invited to
speak at Sophia Amoruso girl boscorelli
and chill invited me to a private dinner
last night with a bunch of yeah this is
this means a lot to me so super cool
people are gonna be there including
women that I personally admire and their
shoes I look up to you
basically the girlboss trolley is
exactly as it sounds it's a rally filled
with fricking Grove bosses nam san from
speakers to attendees it's kind of like
a mini convention I'm meeting Rana there
as soon as I get there because I'm
having a slight wardrobe malfunction I'm
wearing a dress that Calvin Klein sent
to me I'll join Ltd later on when I got
there but um I don't have a boyfriend so
I don't have someone to like zip up the
back of the dress for me you know
hashtag with some girl problems and I'm
wearing a jacket that's like completely
ripped up in the back so you can see so
I'm gonna need Rana to take care of that
for me before people actually see me you
know
so cool
now a lot I know no I see you already
know
like no way
Australia
I really believe in women hood being our
identification so we want to elevate
society it's really praying for us women
to elevate each other it's really
important top plate and Lovelace is the
otherwise we'll be silenced or
marginalize really have a fighting
chance to be heard each other
and for example or in those terms
that's why is that mr. Alex you know
those because it is unfair and it is
really just almost a time in our life is
when not only we have to create that
piece but we also have senior who may
not been sent and I think that
especially especially women pulls a
really huge Cartesian and
okay good thing
