GOVERNOR THINKS MORE TRUMP LEADS
TO MORE WINNING FOR HIS PARTY.
PLEASE COME CAMPAIGN FOR HIM AS
MUCH AS POSSIBLE, HE SAYS,
EARLIER TODAY.
I SAT DOWN WITH NEWT GINGRICH,
AND TALKED ABOUT HIS BOOK,
"TRUMP AMERICA, THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE NATIONS COME BACK."
WHAT IMPACT IS TRUMP HAVING ON
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?
>> HE'S MOVING TO A MUCH MORE
PRO-JOBS, PRO-GROWTH,
RECOMMITTING LIKE, ALMOST LIKE A
REAGAN LIKE COMMITMENT.
HE'S BEEN BRINGING ON MORE
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES.
BUT HE IS VERY AGGRESSIVE, HE'S
A GENUINE POPULIST IN THE SENSE
THAT, I THINK HE FOCUSES ON THE
HARDWORKING, BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS
WHO HISTORICALLY MADE AMERICA
SUCH A REMARKABLE COUNTRY, AND
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY
GET A GOOD DEAL.
THAT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN A
REPUBLICAN MODEL.
>> Sandra: I KNOW IN YOUR BOOK
YOU LIST THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF
THIS PRESIDENCY SO FAR.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRIMARIES,
LIKE WE SAW LAST NIGHT, AND JOHN
COX, ARE YOU GETTING THE SENSE
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
FEELING THE BENEFITS OF THIS
PRESIDENT'S POLICIES?
BEFORE I THINK THERE ARE TWO
DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON.
AMONG REPOT DONE LIKE
REPUBLICANS, HE'S PROBABLY THE
MOST POPULAR PRESIDENT AT THIS
STAGE OF ANY REPUBLICAN.
IT'S REMARKABLE THE NUMBERS.
EVEN MORE SUBSTANTIALLY POPULAR
THAN REAGAN WAS.
I THINK THAT THE INDEPENDENCE
AND THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVEN'T
DRUNK THE KOOL-AID, WHEN YOU
HAVE THE LOWEST BLACK
UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY, WHEN
YOU LITERALLY HAVE IT YESTERDAY
AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THERE ARE
MORE JOBS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE
LOOKING FOR WORK, WHEN YOU HAVE
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAYING THAT
THIS QUARTER MIGHT BE A 4.8%
GROWTH FOR THE ECONOMY, WHICH
WOULD BE A RONALD RAGAN LEVEL
NUMBER.
TWO YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WERE
TELLING US, YOU WILL NEVER GET
ABOVE 2%.
THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL.
WELL, WE BLEW UP THE NEW NORMAL.
AND DONALD TRUMP, I THINK HE
GETS UP EVERY DAY, AND ABOUT
HALF OF HIS FOCUS IS JOBS.
>> Sandra: SPEAKER, WITH ALL
THIS TALK OF THE BLUE WAVE, DO
YOU AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT, IS
IT A RED WAVE?
>> THERE ARE GOING TO GAIN
BETWEEN TWO AND SIX SEATS IN THE
SENATE.
WE WILL PROBABLY GAIN SEATS IN
GOVERNORSHIPS.
THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU CAN
ARGUE IS THE HOUSE, AND FRANKLY,
COX BEING ON THE BALLOT IN
CALIFORNIA IS AN ENORMOUS ASSET
FOR US KEEPING THE SEEDS IN
CALIFORNIA.
IF WE KEEP ALL OF OUR SEATS IN
CALIFORNIA, THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY
GET TO A MAJORITY.
>> Sandra: IT REMARKABLY.
I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON
THIS, SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT
MUELLER REPORTEDLY ASKING
WITNESSES FOR THEIR PERSONAL
CELL PHONES IN ORDER TO GET
INFORMATION OFF OF SOME
ENCRYPTED APPS.
THAT COMES TWO DAYS AFTER QUOTE
DOCUMENTS ACCLAIMED PAUL
MANAFORT TRIED TO TAMPER WITH
WITNESSES AND TRIED TO HIDE IT
BY USING THESE ENCRYPTED APPS ON
HIS PHONE.
APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT
ROBERT MUELLER HAD A WARRANT TO
MONITOR HIS iCLOUD ACCOUNT.
OOPS, HE FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
>> Newt: I THOUGHT HE WAS
SMARTER THAN THAT.
THE FACT IS IF YOU ARE IN THIS
KIND OF INVESTIGATION, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS THE POWER TO GET
TO THE INFORMATION.
IF YOU TRY TO HIDE IT, THEY HAVE
THE POWER TO MAKE YOU TURN IT
OVER UNLESS YOU PLEAD THE FIFTH
AMENDMENT AND YOU END UP IN A
SITUATION WHERE YOU REFUSE TO
TESTIFY.
THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE, YOU
CAN'T SAY TO PEOPLE, I WANT ALL
YOUR INFORMATION EXCEPT THE ONES
YOU WANT TO HIDE.
>> HE'S GOT A HEARING COMING UP
JUNE 15TH, WE WILL SEE WHAT
HAPPENS WITH THAT.
"TRANSAMERICA," I KNOW THIS IS A
BOOK THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE
